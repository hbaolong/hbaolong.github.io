<h4 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h4>
<p>A Comparison of Four Listed Companies</p>
<p>In this chapter we should like to present a sample of security
analysis in operation. We have selected, more or less at random, four
companies which are found successively on the New York Stock Exchange
list. These are ELTRA Corp. (a merger of Electric Autolite and
Mergenthaler Linotype enterprises), Emerson Electric Co. (a manufacturer
of electric and electronic products), Emery Air Freight (a domestic
forwarder of air freight), and Emhart Corp. (originally a maker of
bottling machinery only, but now also in builders’ hardware).* There are
some broad resemblances between the three manufacturing firms, but the
differences will seem more significant. There should be sufficient
variety in the financial and operating data to make the examination of
interest.</p>
<p>In Table 13-1 we present a summary of what the four companies were
selling for in the market at the end of 1970, and a few figures on their
1970 operations. We then detail certain key ratios, which relate on the
one hand to performance and on the other to price. Comment is called for
on how various aspects of the performance pattern agree with the
relative price pattern. Finally, we shall pass the four companies in
review, suggesting some comparisons and relationships and evaluating
each in terms of the requirements of a conservative common-stock
investor.</p>
<p>TABLE 13-2 A Comparison of Four Listed Companies</p>
<p>The most striking fact about the four companies is that the current
price/earnings ratios vary much more widely than their operating
performance or financial condition. Two of the enterprises—ELTRA and
Emhart—were modestly priced at only 9.7 times and 12 times the average
earnings for 1968–1970, as against a similar figure of 15.5 times for
the DJIA. The other two—Emerson and Emery—showed very high multiples of
33 and 45 times such earnings. There is bound to be some explanation of
a difference such as this, and it is found in the superior growth of the
favored companies’ profits in recent years, especially by the freight
forwarder. (But the growth figures of the other two firms were not
unsatisfactory.)</p>
<p>For more comprehensive treatment let us review briefly the chief
elements of performance as they appear from our figures.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Profitability. (a) All the companies show satisfactory earnings
on their book value, but the figures for Emerson and Emery are much
higher than for the other two. A high rate of return on invested capital
often goes along with a high annual growth rate in earnings per share.*
All the companies except Emery showed better earnings on book value in
1969 than in 1961; but the Emery figure was exceptionally large in both
years. (b) For manufacturing companies, the profit figure per dollar of
sales is usually an indication of comparative strength or weakness. We
use here the “ratio of operating income to sales,” as given in Standard
andandandand Poor’s Listed Stock Reports. Here again the results are
satisfactory for all four companies, with an especially impressive
showing by Emerson. The changes between 1961 and 1969 vary considerably
among the companies.</p></li>
<li><p>Stability. This we measure by the maximum decline in per-share
earnings in any one of the past ten years, as against the average of the
three preceding years. No decline translates into 100% stability, and
this was registered by the two popular concerns. But the shrinkages of
ELTRA and Emhart were quite moderate in the “poor year” 1970, amounting
to only 8% each by our measurement, against 7% for the DJIA.</p></li>
<li><p>Growth. The two low-multiplier companies show quite satisfactory
growth rates, in both cases doing better than the Dow Jones group. The
ELTRA figures are especially impressive when set against its low
price/earnings ratio. The growth is of course more impressive for the
high-multiplier pair.</p></li>
<li><p>Financial Position. The three manufacturing companies are in
sound financial condition, having better than the standard ratio of of
current assets for of current liabilities. Emery Air Freight has a lower
ratio; but it falls in a different category, and with its fine record it
would have no problem raising needed cash. All the companies have
relatively low long-term debt. “Dilution” note: Emerson Electric had 63
million of market value of low-dividend convertible preferred shares
outstanding at the end of 1970. In our analysis we have made allowance
for the dilution factor in the usual way by treating the preferred as if
converted into common. This decreased recent earnings by about 10 cents
per share, or some 4%.</p></li>
<li><p>Dividends. What really counts is the history of continuance
without interruption. The best record here is Emhart’s, which has not
suspended a payment since 1902. ELTRA’S record is very good, Emerson’s
quite satisfactory, Emery Freight is a newcomer. The variations in
payout percentage do not seem especially significant. The current
dividend yield is twice as high on the “cheap pair” as on the “dear
pair,” corresponding to the price/earnings ratios.</p></li>
<li><p>Price History. The reader should be impressed by the percentage
advance shown in the price of all four of these issues, as measured from
the lowest to the highest points during the past 34 years. (In all cases
the low price has been adjusted for subsequent stock splits.) Note that
for the DJIA the range from low to high was on the order of 11 to 1; for
our companies the spread has varied from “only” 17 to 1 for Emhart to no
less than 528 to 1 for Emery Air Freight.* These manifold price advances
are characteristic of most of our older common-stock issues, and they
proclaim the great opportunities of profit that have existed in the
stock markets of the past. (But they may indicate also how overdone were
the declines in the bear markets before 1950 when the low prices were
registered.) Both ELTRA and Emhart sustained price shrinkages of more
than 50% in the 1969–70 price break. Emerson and Emery had serious, but
less distressing, declines; the former rebounded to a new all-time high
before the end of 1970, the latter in early 1971.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>General Observations on the Four Companies</p>
<p>Emerson Electric has an enormous total market value, dwarfing the
other three companies combined.* It is one of our “good-will giants,” to
be commented on later. A financial analyst blessed (or handicapped) with
a good memory will think of an analogy between Emerson Electric and
Zenith Radio, and that would not be reassuring. For Zenith had a
brilliant growth record for many years; it too sold in the market for .7
billion (in 1966); but its profits fell from 3 million in 1968 to only
half as much in 1970, and in that year’s big selloff its price declined
to 22½ against the previous top of 89. High valuations entail high
risks.</p>
<p>Emery Air Freight must be the most promising of the four companies in
terms of future growth, if the price/earnings ratio of nearly 40 times
its highest reported earnings is to be even partially justified. The
past growth, of course, has been most impressive. But these figures may
not be so significant for the future if we consider that they started
quite small, at only 70,000 of net earnings in 1958. It often proves
much more difficult to continue to grow at a high rate after volume and
profits have already expanded to big totals. The most surprising aspect
of Emery’s story is that its earnings and market price continued to grow
apace in 1970, which was the worst year in the domestic air-passenger
industry. This is a remarkable achievement indeed, but it raises the
question whether future profits may not be vulnerable to adverse
developments, through increased competition, pressure for new
arrangements between forwarders and airlines, etc. An elaborate study
might be needed before a sound judgment could be passed on these points,
but the conservative investor cannot leave them out of his general
reckoning.</p>
<p>Emhart and ELTRA. Emhart has done better in its business than in the
stock market over the past 14 years. In 1958 it sold as high as 22 times
the current earnings—about the same ratio as for the DJIA. Since then
its profits tripled, as against a rise of less than 100% for the Dow,
but its closing price in 1970 was only a third above the 1958 high,
versus 43% for the Dow. The record of ELTRA is somewhat similar. It
appears that neither of these companies possesses glamour, or “sex
appeal,” in the present market; but in all the statistical data they
show up surprisingly well. Their future prospects? We have no sage
remarks to make here, but this is what Standard andandandand Poor’s had
to say about the four companies in 1971:</p>
<p>ELTRA—“Long-term Prospects: Certain operations are cyclical, but an
established competitive position and diversification are offsetting
factors.”</p>
<p>Emerson Electric—“While adequately priced (at 71) on the current
outlook, the shares have appeal for the long term…. A continued
acquisition policy together with a strong position in industrial fields
and an accelerated international program suggests further sales and
earnings progress.”</p>
<p>Emery Air Freight—“The shares appear amply priced (at 57) on current
prospects, but are well worth holding for the long pull.”</p>
<p>Emhart—“Although restricted this year by lower capital spending in
the glass-container industry, earnings should be aided by an improved
business environment in 1972. The shares are worth holding (at 34).”</p>
<p>Conclusions: Many financial analysts will find Emerson and Emery more
interesting and appealing stocks than the other two—primarily, perhaps,
because of their better “market action,” and secondarily because of
their faster recent growth in earnings. Under our principles of
conservative investment the first is not a valid reason for
selection—that is something for the speculators to play around with. The
second has validity, but within limits. Can the past growth and the
presumably good prospects of Emery Air Freight justify a price more than
60 times its recent earnings?1 Our answer would be: Maybe for someone
who has made an in-depth study of the possibilities of this company and
come up with exceptionally firm and optimistic conclusions. But not for
the careful investor who wants to be reasonably sure in advance that he
is not committing the typical Wall Street error of overenthusiasm for
good performance in earnings and in the stock market.* The same
cautionary statements seem called for in the case of Emerson Electric,
with a special reference to the market’s current valuation of over a
billion dollars for the intangible, or earning-power, factor here. We
should add that the “electronics industry,” once a fair-haired child of
the stock market, has in general fallen on disastrous days. Emerson is
an outstanding exception, but it will have to continue to be such an
exception for a great many years in the future before the 1970 closing
price will have been fully justified by its subsequent performance.</p>
<p>By contrast, both ELTRA at 27 and Emhart at 33 have the earmarks of
companies with sufficient value behind their price to constitute
reasonably protected investments. Here the investor can, if he wishes,
consider himself basically a part owner of these businesses, at a cost
corresponding to what the balance sheet shows to be the money invested
therein.* The rate of earnings on invested capital has long been
satisfactory; the stability of profits also; the past growth rate
surprisingly so. The two companies will meet our seven statistical
requirements for inclusion in a defensive investor’s portfolio. These
will be developed in the next chapter, but we summarize them as
follows:</p>
<p>Adequate size.</p>
<p>A sufficiently strong financial condition.</p>
<p>Continued dividends for at least the past 20 years.</p>
<p>No earnings deficit in the past ten years.</p>
<p>Ten-year growth of at least one-third in per-share earnings.</p>
<p>Price of stock no more than 1½ times net asset value.</p>
<p>Price no more than 15 times average earnings of the past three
years.</p>
<p>We make no predictions about the future earnings performance of ELTRA
or Emhart. In the investor’s diversified list of common stocks there are
bound to be some that prove disappointing, and this may be the case for
one or both of this pair. But the diversified list itself, based on the
above principles of selection, plus whatever other sensible criteria the
investor may wish to apply, should perform well enough across the years.
At least, long experience tells us so.</p>
<p>A final observation: An experienced security analyst, even if he
accepted our general reasoning on these four companies, would have
hesitated to recommend that a holder of Emerson or Emery exchange his
shares for ELTRA or Emhart at the end of 1970—unless the holder
understood clearly the philosophy behind the recommendation. There was
no reason to expect that in any short period of time the low-multiplier
duo would outperform the high-multipliers. The latter were well thought
of in the market and thus had a considerable degree of momentum behind
them, which might continue for an indefinite period. The sound basis for
preferring ELTRA and Emhart to Emerson and Emery would be the client’s
considered conclusion that he preferred value-type investments to
glamour-type investments. Thus, to a substantial extent, common-stock
investment policy must depend on the attitude of the individual
investor. This approach is treated at greater length in our next
chapter.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 13</p>
<p>In the Air Force we have a rule: check six. A guy is flying along,
looking in all directions, and feeling very safe. Another guy flies up
behind him (at “6 o’clock”—“12 o’clock” is directly in front) and
shoots. Most airplanes are shot down that way. Thinking that you’re safe
is very dangerous! Somewhere, there’s a weakness you’ve got to find. You
must always check six o’clock.</p>
<p>—U.S. Air Force Gen. Donald Kutyna</p>
<p>E-Business</p>
<p>As Graham did, let’s compare and contrast four stocks, using their
reported numbers as of December 31, 1999—a time that will enable us to
view some of the most drastic extremes of valuation ever recorded in the
stock market.</p>
<p>Emerson Electric Co. (ticker symbol: EMR) was founded in 1890 and is
the only surviving member of Graham’s original quartet; it makes a wide
array of products, including power tools, air-conditioning equipment,
and electrical motors.</p>
<p>EMC Corp. (ticker symbol: EMC) dates back to 1979 and enables
companies to automate the storage of electronic information over
computer networks.</p>
<p>Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (ticker symbol: EXPD),
founded in Seattle in 1979, helps shippers organize and track the
movement of goods around the world.</p>
<p>Exodus Communications, Inc. (ticker symbol: EXDS) hosts and manages
websites for corporate customers, along with other Internet services; it
first sold shares to the public in March 1998.</p>
<p>This table summarizes the price, performance, and valuation of these
companies as of year-end 1999:</p>
<p>Electric, Not Electrifying</p>
<p>The most expensive of Graham’s four stocks, Emerson Electric, ended
up as the cheapest in our updated group. With its base in Old Economy
industries, Emerson looked boring in the late 1990s. (In the Internet
Age, who cared about Emerson’s heavy-duty wet-dry vacuums?) The
company’s shares went into suspended animation. In 1998 and 1999,
Emerson’s stock lagged the S andandandand P 500 index by a cumulative
49.7 percentage points, a miserable underperformance.</p>
<p>But that was Emerson the stock. What about Emerson the company? In
1999, Emerson sold 4.4 billion worth of goods and services, up nearly
billion from the year before. On those revenues Emerson earned .3
billion in net income, or 6.9% more than in 1998. Over the previous five
years, earnings per share had risen at a robust average rate of 8.3%.
Emerson’s dividend had more than doubled to .30 per share; book value
had gone from .69 to 4.27 per share. According to Value Line, throughout
the 1990s, Emerson’s net profit margin and return on capital—key
measures of its efficiency as a business—had stayed robustly high,
around 9% and 18% respectively. What’s more, Emerson had increased its
earnings for 42 years in a row and had raised its dividend for 43
straight years—one of the longest runs of steady growth in American
business. At year-end, Emerson’s stock was priced at 17.7 times the
company’s net income per share. Like its power tools, Emerson was never
flashy, but it was reliable—and showed no sign of overheating.</p>
<p>Could EMC Grow PDQ?</p>
<p>EMC Corp. was one of the best-performing stocks of the 1990s,
rising—or should we say levitating?—more than 81,000%. If you had
invested 0,000 in EMC’s stock at the beginning of 1990, you would have
ended 1999 with just over .1 million. EMC’s shares returned 157.1% in
1999 alone—more than Emerson’s stock had gained in the eight years from
1992 through 1999 combined. EMC had never paid a dividend, instead
retaining all its earnings “to provide funds for the continued growth of
the company.”1 At their December 31 price of 4.625, EMC’s shares were
trading at 103 times the earnings the company would report for the full
year—nearly six times the valuation level of Emerson’s stock.</p>
<p>What about EMC the business? Revenues grew 24% in 1999, rising to .7
billion. Its earnings per share soared to 92 cents from 61 cents the
year before, a 51% increase. Over the five years ending in 1999, EMC’s
earnings had risen at a sizzling annual rate of 28.8%. And, with
everyone expecting the tidal wave of Internet commerce to keep rolling,
the future looked even brighter. Throughout 1999, EMC’s chief executive
repeatedly predicted that revenues would hit 0 billion by 2001—up from
.4 billion in 1998.2 That would require average annual growth of 23%, a
monstrous rate of expansion for so big a company. But Wall Street’s
analysts, and most investors, were sure EMC could do it. After all, over
the previous five years, EMC had more than doubled its revenues and
better than tripled its net income.</p>
<p>But from 1995 through 1999, according to Value Line, EMC’s net profit
margin slid from 19.0% to 17.4%, while its return on capital dropped
from 26.8% to 21%. Although still highly profitable, EMC was already
slipping. And in October 1999, EMC acquired Data General Corp., which
added roughly .1 billion to EMC’s revenues that year. Simply by
subtracting the extra revenues brought in from Data General, we can see
that the volume of EMC’s existing businesses grew from .4 billion in
1998 to just .6 billion in 1999, a rise of only 3.6%. In other words,
EMC’s true growth rate was almost nil—even in a year when the scare over
the “Y2K” computer bug had led many companies to spend record amounts on
new technology.3</p>
<p>A Simple Twist of Freight</p>
<p>Unlike EMC, Expeditors International hadn’t yet learned to levitate.
Although the firm’s shares had risen 30% annually in the 1990s, much of
that big gain had come at the very end, as the stock raced to a 109.1%
return in 1999. The year before, Expeditors’ shares had gone up just
9.5%, trailing the S andandandand P 500 index by more than 19 percentage
points.</p>
<p>What about the business? Expeditors was growing expeditiously indeed:
Since 1995, its revenues had risen at an average annual rate of 19.8%,
nearly tripling over the period to finish 1999 at .4 billion. And
earnings per share had grown by 25.8% annually, while dividends had
risen at a 27% annual clip. Expeditors had no long-term debt, and its
working capital had nearly doubled since 1995. According to Value Line,
Expeditors’ book value per share had increased 129% and its return on
capital had risen by more than one-third to 21%.</p>
<p>By any standard, Expeditors was a superb business. But the little
freight-forwarding company, with its base in Seattle and much of its
operations in Asia, was all-but-unknown on Wall Street. Only 32% of the
shares were owned by institutional investors; in fact, Expeditors had
only 8,500 shareholders. After doubling in 1999, the stock was priced at
39 times the net income Expeditors would earn for the year—no longer
anywhere near cheap, but well below the vertiginous valuation of
EMC.</p>
<p>The Promised Land?</p>
<p>By the end of 1999, Exodus Communications seemed to have taken its
shareholders straight to the land of milk and honey. The stock soared
1,005.8% in 1999—enough to turn a 0,000 investment on January 1 into
more than 10,000 by December 31. Wall Street’s leading Internet-stock
analysts, including the hugely influential Henry Blodget of Merrill
Lynch, were predicting that the stock would rise another 25% to 125%
over the coming year.</p>
<p>And best of all, in the eyes of the online traders who gorged on
Exodus’s gains, was the fact that the stock had split 2-for-1 three
times during 1999. In a 2-for-1 stock split, a company doubles the
number of its shares and halves their price—so a shareholder ends up
owning twice as many shares, each priced at half the former level.
What’s so great about that? Imagine that you handed me a dime, and I
then gave you back two nickels and asked, “Don’t you feel richer now?”
You would probably conclude either that I was an idiot, or that I had
mistaken you for one. And yet, in 1999’s frenzy over dot-com stocks,
online traders acted exactly as if two nickels were more valuable than
one dime. In fact, just the news that a stock would be splitting 2-for-1
could instantly drive its shares up 20% or more.</p>
<p>Why? Because getting more shares makes people feel richer. Someone
who bought 100 shares of Exodus in January watched them turn into 200
when the stock split in April; then those 200 turned into 400 in August;
then the 400 became 800 in December. It was thrilling for these people
to realize that they had gotten 700 more shares just for owning 100 in
the first place. To them, that felt like “found money”—never mind that
the price per share had been cut in half with each split.4 In December,
1999, one elated Exodus shareholder, who went by the handle
“givemeadollar,” exulted on an online message board: “I’m going to hold
these shares until I’m 80, 〔because〕 after it splits hundreds of times
over the next years, I’ll be close to becoming CEO.”5</p>
<p>What about Exodus the business? Graham wouldn’t have touched it with
a 10-foot pole and a haz-mat suit. Exodus’s revenues were
exploding—growing from 2.7 million in 1998 to 42.1 million in 1999—but
it lost 30.3 million on those revenues in 1999, nearly double its loss
the year before. Exodus had .6 billion in total debt—and was so starved
for cash that it borrowed 71 million in the month of December alone.
According to Exodus’s annual report, that new borrowing would add more
than 0 million to its interest payments in the coming year. The company
started 1999 with 56 million in cash and, even after raising .3 billion
in new financing, finished the year with a cash balance of
billion—meaning that its businesses had devoured more than 00 million in
cash during 1999. How could such a company ever pay its debts?</p>
<p>But, of course, online traders were fixated on how far and fast the
stock had risen, not on whether the company was healthy. “This stock,”
bragged a trader using the screen name of “Launch_Pad 1999,” “will just
continue climbing to infinity and beyond.”6</p>
<p>The absurdity of Launch_Pad’s prediction—what is “beyond”
infinity?—is the perfect reminder of one of Graham’s classic warnings.
“Today’s investor,” Graham tells us,</p>
<p>is so concerned with anticipating the future that he is already
paying handsomely for it in advance. Thus what he has projected with so
much study and care may actually happen and still not bring him any
profit. If it should fail to materialize to the degree expected he may
in fact be faced with a serious temporary and perhaps even permanent
loss.”7</p>
<p>Where the Es Ended Up</p>
<p>How did these four stocks perform after 1999?</p>
<p>Emerson Electric went on to gain 40.7% in 2000. Although the shares
lost money in both 2001 and 2002, they nevertheless ended 2002 less than
4% below their final price of 1999.</p>
<p>EMC also rose in 2000, gaining 21.7%. But then the shares lost 79.4%
in 2001 and another 54.3% in 2002. That left them 88% below their level
at year-end 1999. What about the forecast of 0 billion in revenues by
2001? EMC finished that year with revenues of just .1 billion (and a net
loss of 08 million).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as if the bear market did not even exist, Expeditors
International’s shares went on to gain 22.9% in 2000, 6.5% in 2001, and
another 15.1% in 2002—finishing that year nearly 51% higher than their
price at the end of 1999.</p>
<p>Exodus’s stock lost 55% in 2000 and 99.8% in 2001. On September 26,
2001, Exodus filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Most of the
company’s assets were bought by Cable andandandand Wireless, the British
telecommunications giant. Instead of delivering its shareholders to the
promised land, Exodus left them exiled in the wilderness. As of early
2003, the last trade in Exodus’s stock was at one penny a share.</p>
