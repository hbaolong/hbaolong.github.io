<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>The Investor and Market Fluctuations</p>
<p>To the extent that the investor’s funds are placed in high-grade
bonds of relatively short maturity—say, of seven years or less—he will
not be affected significantly by changes in market prices and need not
take them into account. (This applies also to his holdings of U.S.
savings bonds, which he can always turn in at his cost price or more.)
His longer-term bonds may have relatively wide price swings during their
lifetimes, and his common-stock portfolio is almost certain to fluctuate
in value over any period of several years.</p>
<p>The investor should know about these possibilities and should be
prepared for them both financially and psychologically. He will want to
benefit from changes in market levels—certainly through an advance in
the value of his stock holdings as time goes on, and perhaps also by
making purchases and sales at advantageous prices. This interest on his
part is inevitable, and legitimate enough. But it involves the very real
danger that it will lead him into speculative attitudes and activities.
It is easy for us to tell you not to speculate; the hard thing will be
for you to follow this advice. Let us repeat what we said at the outset:
If you want to speculate do so with your eyes open, knowing that you
will probably lose money in the end; be sure to limit the amount at risk
and to separate it completely from your investment program.</p>
<p>We shall deal first with the more important subject of price changes
in common stocks, and pass later to the area of bonds. In Chapter 3 we
supplied a historical survey of the stock market’s action over the past
hundred years. In this section we shall return to that material from
time to time, in order to see what the past record promises the
investor—in either the form of long-term appreciation of a portfolio
held relatively unchanged through successive rises and declines, or in
the possibilities of buying near bear-market lows and selling not too
far below bull-market highs.</p>
<p>Market Fluctuations as a Guide to Investment Decisions</p>
<p>Since common stocks, even of investment grade, are subject to
recurrent and wide fluctuations in their prices, the intelligent
investor should be interested in the possibilities of profiting from
these pendulum swings. There are two possible ways by which he may try
to do this: the way of timing and the way of pricing. By timing we mean
the endeavor to anticipate the action of the stock market—to buy or hold
when the future course is deemed to be upward, to sell or refrain from
buying when the course is downward. By pricing we mean the endeavor to
buy stocks when they are quoted below their fair value and to sell them
when they rise above such value. A less ambitious form of pricing is the
simple effort to make sure that when you buy you do not pay too much for
your stocks. This may suffice for the defensive investor, whose emphasis
is on long-pull holding; but as such it represents an essential minimum
of attention to market levels.1</p>
<p>We are convinced that the intelligent investor can derive
satisfactory results from pricing of either type. We are equally sure
that if he places his emphasis on timing, in the sense of forecasting,
he will end up as a speculator and with a speculator’s financial
results. This distinction may seem rather tenuous to the layman, and it
is not commonly accepted on Wall Street. As a matter of business
practice, or perhaps of thoroughgoing conviction, the stock brokers and
the investment services seem wedded to the principle that both investors
and speculators in common stocks should devote careful attention to
market forecasts.</p>
<p>The farther one gets from Wall Street, the more skepticism one will
find, we believe, as to the pretensions of stock-market forecasting or
timing. The investor can scarcely take seriously the innumerable
predictions which appear almost daily and are his for the asking. Yet in
many cases he pays attention to them and even acts upon them. Why?
Because he has been persuaded that it is important for him to form some
opinion of the future course of the stock market, and because he feels
that the brokerage or service forecast is at least more dependable than
his own.11</p>
<p>We lack space here to discuss in detail the pros and cons of market
forecasting. A great deal of brain power goes into this field, and
undoubtedly some people can make money by being good stock-market
analysts. But it is absurd to think that the general public can ever
make money out of market forecasts. For who will buy when the general
public, at a given signal, rushes to sell out at a profit? If you, the
reader, expect to get rich over the years by following some system or
leadership in market forecasting, you must be expecting to try to do
what countless others are aiming at, and to be able to do it better than
your numerous competitors in the market. There is no basis either in
logic or in experience for assuming that any typical or average investor
can anticipate market movements more successfully than the general
public, of which he is himself a part.</p>
<p>There is one aspect of the “timing” philosophy which seems to have
escaped everyone’s notice. Timing is of great psychological importance
to the speculator because he wants to make his profit in a hurry. The
idea of waiting a year before his stock moves up is repugnant to him.
But a waiting period, as such, is of no consequence to the investor.
What advantage is there to him in having his money uninvested until he
receives some (presumably) trustworthy signal that the time has come to
buy? He enjoys an advantage only if by waiting he succeeds in buying
later at a sufficiently lower price to offset his loss of dividend
income. What this means is that timing is of no real value to the
investor unless it coincides with pricing—that is, unless it enables him
to repurchase his shares at substantially under his previous selling
price.</p>
<p>In this respect the famous Dow theory for timing purchases and sales
has had an unusual history.* Briefly, this technique takes its signal to
buy from a special kind of “breakthrough” of the stock averages on the
up side, and its selling signal from a similar breakthrough on the down
side. The calculated—not necessarily actual—results of using this method
showed an almost unbroken series of profits in operations from 1897 to
the early 1960s. On the basis of this presentation the practical value
of the Dow theory would have appeared firmly established; the doubt, if
any, would apply to the dependability of this published “record” as a
picture of what a Dow theorist would actually have done in the
market.</p>
<p>A closer study of the figures indicates that the quality of the
results shown by the Dow theory changed radically after 1938—a few years
after the theory had begun to be taken seriously on Wall Street. Its
spectacular achievement had been in giving a sell signal, at 306, about
a month before the 1929 crash and in keeping its followers out of the
long bear market until things had pretty well righted themselves, at 84,
in 1933. But from 1938 on the Dow theory operated mainly by taking its
practitioners out at a pretty good price but then putting them back in
again at a higher price. For nearly 30 years thereafter, one would have
done appreciably better by just buying and holding the DJIA.2</p>
<p>In our view, based on much study of this problem, the change in the
Dow-theory results is not accidental. It demonstrates an inherent
characteristic of forecasting and trading formulas in the fields of
business and finance. Those formulas that gain adherents and importance
do so because they have worked well over a period, or sometimes merely
because they have been plausibly adapted to the statistical record of
the past. But as their acceptance increases, their reliability tends to
diminish. This happens for two reasons: First, the passage of time
brings new conditions which the old formula no longer fits. Second, in
stock-market affairs the popularity of a trading theory has itself an
influence on the market’s behavior which detracts in the long run from
its profit-making possibilities. (The popularity of something like the
Dow theory may seem to create its own vindication, since it would make
the market advance or decline by the very action of its followers when a
buying or selling signal is given. A “stampede” of this kind is, of
course, much more of a danger than an advantage to the public
trader.)</p>
<p>Buy-Low–Sell-High Approach</p>
<p>We are convinced that the average investor cannot deal successfully
with price movements by endeavoring to forecast them. Can he benefit
from them after they have taken place—i.e., by buying after each major
decline and selling out after each major advance? The fluctuations of
the market over a period of many years prior to 1950 lent considerable
encouragement to that idea. In fact, a classic definition of a “shrewd
investor” was “one who bought in a bear market when everyone else was
selling, and sold out in a bull market when everyone else was buying.”
If we examine our Chart I, covering the fluctuations of the Standard
andandandand Poor’s composite index between 1900 and 1970, and the
supporting figures in Table 3-1 (p.66), we can readily see why this
viewpoint appeared valid until fairly recent years.</p>
<p>Between 1897 and 1949 there were ten complete market cycles, running
from bear-market low to bull-market high and back to bear-market low.
Six of these took no longer than four years, four ran for six or seven
years, and one—the famous “new-era” cycle of 1921–1932—lasted eleven
years. The percentage of advance from the lows to highs ranged from 44%
to 500%, with most between about 50% and 100%. The percentage of
subsequent declines ranged from 24% to 89%, with most found between 40%
and 50%. (It should be remembered that a decline of 50% fully offsets a
preceding advance of 100%.)</p>
<p>Nearly all the bull markets had a number of well-defined
characteristics in common, such as (1) a historically high price level,
(2) high price/earnings ratios, (3) low dividend yields as against bond
yields, (4) much speculation on margin, and (5) many offerings of new
common-stock issues of poor quality. Thus to the student of stock-market
history it appeared that the intelligent investor should have been able
to identify the recurrent bear and bull markets, to buy in the former
and sell in the latter, and to do so for the most part at reasonably
short intervals of time. Various methods were developed for determining
buying and selling levels of the general market, based on either value
factors or percentage movements of prices or both.</p>
<p>But we must point out that even prior to the unprecedented bull
market that began in 1949, there were sufficient variations in the
successive market cycles to complicate and sometimes frustrate the
desirable process of buying low and selling high. The most notable of
these departures, of course, was the great bull market of the late
1920s, which threw all calculations badly out of gear.* Even in 1949,
therefore, it was by no means a certainty that the investor could base
his financial policies and procedures mainly on the endeavor to buy at
low levels in bear markets and to sell out at high levels in bull
markets.</p>
<p>It turned out, in the sequel, that the opposite was true. The
market’s behavior in the past 20 years has not followed the former
pattern, nor obeyed what once were well-established danger signals, nor
permitted its successful exploitation by applying old rules for buying
low and selling high. Whether the old, fairly regular
bull-and-bear-market pattern will eventually return we do not know. But
it seems unrealistic to us for the investor to endeavor to base his
present policy on the classic formula—i.e., to wait for demonstrable
bear-market levels before buying any common stocks. Our recommended
policy has, however, made provision for changes in the proportion of
common stocks to bonds in the portfolio, if the investor chooses to do
so, according as the level of stock prices appears less or more
attractive by value standards.*</p>
<p>Formula Plans</p>
<p>In the early years of the stock-market rise that began in 1949–50
considerable interest was attracted to various methods of taking
advantage of the stock market’s cycles. These have been known as
“formula investment plans.” The essence of all such plans—except the
simple case of dollar averaging—is that the investor automatically does
some selling of common stocks when the market advances substantially. In
many of them a very large rise in the market level would result in the
sale of all common-stock holdings; others provided for retention of a
minor proportion of equities under all circumstances.</p>
<p>This approach had the double appeal of sounding logical (and
conservative) and of showing excellent results when applied
retrospectively to the stock market over many years in the past.
Unfortunately, its vogue grew greatest at the very time when it was
destined to work least well. Many of the “formula planners” found
themselves entirely or nearly out of the stock market at some level in
the middle 1950s. True, they had realized excellent profits, but in a
broad sense the market “ran away” from them thereafter, and their
formulas gave them little opportunity to buy back a common-stock
position.*</p>
<p>There is a similarity between the experience of those adopting the
formula-investing approach in the early 1950s and those who embraced the
purely mechanical version of the Dow theory some 20 years earlier. In
both cases the advent of popularity marked almost the exact moment when
the system ceased to work well. We have had a like discomfiting
experience with our own “central value method” of determining indicated
buying and selling levels of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The moral
seems to be that any approach to moneymaking in the stock market which
can be easily described and followed by a lot of people is by its terms
too simple and too easy to last.† Spinoza’s concluding remark applies to
Wall Street as well as to philosophy: “All things excellent are as
difficult as they are rare.”</p>
<p>Market Fluctuations of the Investor’s Portfolio</p>
<p>Every investor who owns common stocks must expect to see them
fluctuate in value over the years. The behavior of the DJIA since our
last edition was written in 1964 probably reflects pretty well what has
happened to the stock portfolio of a conservative investor who limited
his stock holdings to those of large, prominent, and conservatively
financed corporations. The overall value advanced from an average level
of about 890 to a high of 995 in 1966 (and 985 again in 1968), fell to
631 in 1970, and made an almost full recovery to 940 in early 1971.
(Since the individual issues set their high and low marks at different
times, the fluctuations in the Dow Jones group as a whole are less
severe than those in the separate components.) We have traced through
the price fluctuations of other types of diversified and conservative
common-stock portfolios and we find that the overall results are not
likely to be markedly different from the above. In general, the shares
of second-line companies* fluctuate more widely than the major ones, but
this does not necessarily mean that a group of well-established but
smaller companies will make a poorer showing over a fairly long period.
In any case the investor may as well resign himself in advance to the
probability rather than the mere possibility that most of his holdings
will advance, say, 50% or more from their low point and decline the
equivalent one-third or more from their high point at various periods in
the next five years.†</p>
<p>A serious investor is not likely to believe that the day-to-day or
even month-to-month fluctuations of the stock market make him richer or
poorer. But what about the longer-term and wider changes? Here practical
questions present themselves, and the psychological problems are likely
to grow complicated. A substantial rise in the market is at once a
legitimate reason for satisfaction and a cause for prudent concern, but
it may also bring a strong temptation toward imprudent action. Your
shares have advanced, good! You are richer than you were, good! But has
the price risen too high, and should you think of selling? Or should you
kick yourself for not having bought more shares when the level was
lower? Or—worst thought of all—should you now give way to the
bull-market atmosphere, become infected with the enthusiasm, the
overconfidence and the greed of the great public (of which, after all,
you are a part), and make larger and dangerous commitments? Presented
thus in print, the answer to the last question is a self-evident no, but
even the intelligent investor is likely to need considerable will power
to keep from following the crowd.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by
calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of
mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the
investor’s portfolio. The chief advantage, perhaps, is that such a
formula will give him something to do. As the market advances he will
from time to time make sales out of his stockholdings, putting the
proceeds into bonds; as it declines he will reverse the procedure. These
activities will provide some outlet for his otherwise too-pent-up
energies. If he is the right kind of investor he will take added
satisfaction from the thought that his operations are exactly opposite
from those of the crowd.*</p>
<p>Business Valuations versus Stock-Market Valuations</p>
<p>The impact of market fluctuations upon the investor’s true situation
may be considered also from the standpoint of the shareholder as the
part owner of various businesses. The holder of marketable shares
actually has a double status, and with it the privilege of taking
advantage of either at his choice. On the one hand his position is
analogous to that of a minority shareholder or silent partner in a
private business. Here his results are entirely dependent on the profits
of the enterprise or on a change in the underlying value of its assets.
He would usually determine the value of such a private-business interest
by calculating his share of the net worth as shown in the most recent
balance sheet. On the other hand, the common-stock investor holds a
piece of paper, an engraved stock certificate, which can be sold in a
matter of minutes at a price which varies from moment to moment—when the
market is open, that is—and often is far removed from the balance-sheet
value.*</p>
<p>The development of the stock market in recent decades has made the
typical investor more dependent on the course of price quotations and
less free than formerly to consider himself merely a business owner. The
reason is that the successful enterprises in which he is likely to
concentrate his holdings sell almost constantly at prices well above
their net asset value (or book value, or “balance-sheet value”). In
paying these market premiums the investor gives precious hostages to
fortune, for he must depend on the stock market itself to validate his
commitments.†</p>
<p>This is a factor of prime importance in present-day investing, and it
has received less attention than it deserves. The whole structure of
stock-market quotations contains a built-in contradiction. The better a
company’s record and prospects, the less relationship the price of its
shares will have to their book value. But the greater the premium above
book value, the less certain the basis of determining its intrinsic
value—i.e., the more this “value” will depend on the changing moods and
measurements of the stock market. Thus we reach the final paradox, that
the more successful the company, the greater are likely to be the
fluctuations in the price of its shares. This really means that, in a
very real sense, the better the quality of a common stock, the more
speculative it is likely to be—at least as compared with the
unspectacular middle-grade issues.* (What we have said applies to a
comparison of the leading growth companies with the bulk of
well-established concerns; we exclude from our purview here those issues
which are highly speculative because the businesses themselves are
speculative.)</p>
<p>The argument made above should explain the often erratic price
behavior of our most successful and impressive enterprises. Our favorite
example is the monarch of them all—International Business Machines. The
price of its shares fell from 607 to 300 in seven months in 1962–63;
after two splits its price fell from 387 to 219 in 1970. Similarly,
Xerox—an even more impressive earnings gainer in recent decades—fell
from 171 to 87 in 1962–63, and from 116 to 65 in 1970. These striking
losses did not indicate any doubt about the future long-term growth of
IBM or Xerox; they reflected instead a lack of confidence in the premium
valuation that the stock market itself had placed on these excellent
prospects.</p>
<p>The previous discussion leads us to a conclusion of practical
importance to the conservative investor in common stocks. If he is to
pay some special attention to the selection of his portfolio, it might
be best for him to concentrate on issues selling at a reasonably close
approximation to their tangible-asset value—say, at not more than
one-third above that figure. Purchases made at such levels, or lower,
may with logic be regarded as related to the company’s balance sheet,
and as having a justification or support independent of the fluctuating
market prices. The premium over book value that may be involved can be
considered as a kind of extra fee paid for the advantage of
stock-exchange listing and the marketability that goes with it.</p>
<p>A caution is needed here. A stock does not become a sound investment
merely because it can be bought at close to its asset value. The
investor should demand, in addition, a satisfactory ratio of earnings to
price, a sufficiently strong financial position, and the prospect that
its earnings will at least be maintained over the years. This may appear
like demanding a lot from a modestly priced stock, but the prescription
is not hard to fill under all but dangerously high market conditions.
Once the investor is willing to forgo brilliant prospects—i.e., better
than average expected growth—he will have no difficulty in finding a
wide selection of issues meeting these criteria.</p>
<p>In our chapters on the selection of common stocks (Chapters 14 and
15) we shall give data showing that more than half of the DJIA issues
met our asset-value criterion at the end of 1970. The most widely held
investment of all—American Tel. andandandand Tel.—actually sells below
its tangible-asset value as we write. Most of the light-and- power
shares, in addition to their other advantages, are now (early 1972)
available at prices reasonably close to their asset values.</p>
<p>The investor with a stock portfolio having such book values behind it
can take a much more independent and detached view of stock-market
fluctuations than those who have paid high multipliers of both earnings
and tangible assets. As long as the earning power of his holdings
remains satisfactory, he can give as little attention as he pleases to
the vagaries of the stock market. More than that, at times he can use
these vagaries to play the master game of buying low and selling
high.</p>
<p>The A. andandandand P. Example</p>
<p>At this point we shall introduce one of our original examples, which
dates back many years but which has a certain fascination for us because
it combines so many aspects of corporate and investment experience. It
involves the Great Atlantic andandandand Pacific Tea Co. Here is the
story:</p>
<p>A. andandandand P. shares were introduced to trading on the “Curb”
market, now the American Stock Exchange, in 1929 and sold as high as
494. By 1932 they had declined to 104, although the company’s earnings
were nearly as large in that generally catastrophic year as previously.
In 1936 the range was between 111 and 131. Then in the business
recession and bear market of 1938 the shares fell to a new low of
36.</p>
<p>That price was extraordinary. It meant that the preferred and common
were together selling for 26 million, although the company had just
reported that it held 5 million in cash alone and a working capital (or
net current assets) of 34 million. A. andandandand P. was the largest
retail enterprise in America, if not in the world, with a continuous and
impressive record of large earnings for many years. Yet in 1938 this
outstanding business was considered on Wall Street to be worth less than
its current assets alone—which means less as a going concern than if it
were liquidated. Why? First, because there were threats of special taxes
on chain stores; second, because net profits had fallen off in the
previous year; and, third, because the general market was depressed. The
first of these reasons was an exaggerated and eventually groundless
fear; the other two were typical of temporary influences.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the investor had bought A. andandandand P. common
in 1937 at, say, 12 times its five-year average earnings, or about 80.
We are far from asserting that the ensuing decline to 36 was of no
importance to him. He would have been well advised to scrutinize the
picture with some care, to see whether he had made any miscalculations.
But if the results of his study were reassuring—as they should have
been—he was entitled then to disregard the market decline as a temporary
vagary of finance, unless he had the funds and the courage to take
advantage of it by buying more on the bargain basis offered.</p>
<p>Sequel and Reflections</p>
<p>The following year, 1939, A. andandandand P. shares advanced to 117½,
or three times the low price of 1938 and well above the average of 1937.
Such a turnabout in the behavior of common stocks is by no means
uncommon, but in the case of A. andandandand P. it was more striking
than most. In the years after 1949 the grocery chain’s shares rose with
the general market until in 1961 the split-up stock (10 for 1) reached a
high of 70½ which was equivalent to 705 for the 1938 shares.</p>
<p>This price of 70½ was remarkable for the fact it was 30 times the
earnings of 1961. Such a price/earnings ratio—which compares with 23
times for the DJIA in that year—must have implied expectations of a
brilliant growth in earnings. This optimism had no justification in the
company’s earnings record in the preceding years, and it proved
completely wrong. Instead of advancing rapidly, the course of earnings
in the ensuing period was generally downward. The year after the 70½
high the price fell by more than half to 34. But this time the shares
did not have the bargain quality that they showed at the low quotation
in 1938. After varying sorts of fluctuations the price fell to another
low of 21½ in 1970 and 18 in 1972—having reported the first quarterly
deficit in its history.</p>
<p>We see in this history how wide can be the vicissitudes of a major
American enterprise in little more than a single generation, and also
with what miscalculations and excesses of optimism and pessimism the
public has valued its shares. In 1938 the business was really being
given away, with no takers; in 1961 the public was clamoring for the
shares at a ridiculously high price. After that came a quick loss of
half the market value, and some years later a substantial further
decline. In the meantime the company was to turn from an outstanding to
a mediocre earnings performer; its profit in the boom-year 1968 was to
be less than in 1958; it had paid a series of confusing small stock
dividends not warranted by the current additions to surplus; and so
forth. A. andandandand P. was a larger company in 1961 and 1972 than in
1938, but not as well-run, not as profitable, and not as
attractive.*</p>
<p>There are two chief morals to this story. The first is that the stock
market often goes far wrong, and sometimes an alert and courageous
investor can take advantage of its patent errors. The other is that most
businesses change in character and quality over the years, sometimes for
the better, perhaps more often for the worse. The investor need not
watch his companies’ performance like a hawk; but he should give it a
good, hard look from time to time.</p>
<p>Let us return to our comparison between the holder of marketable
shares and the man with an interest in a private business. We have said
that the former has the option of considering himself merely as the part
owner of the various businesses he has invested in, or as the holder of
shares which are salable at any time he wishes at their quoted market
price.</p>
<p>But note this important fact: The true investor scarcely ever is
forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to
disregard the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and
act upon it only to the extent that it suits his book, and no more.*
Thus the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried
by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely
transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That man
would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he
would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by other persons’
mistakes of judgment.†</p>
<p>Incidentally, a widespread situation of this kind actually existed
during the dark depression days of 1931–1933. There was then a
psychological advantage in owning business interests that had no quoted
market. For example, people who owned first mortgages on real estate
that continued to pay interest were able to tell themselves that their
investments had kept their full value, there being no market quotations
to indicate otherwise. On the other hand, many listed corporation bonds
of even better quality and greater underlying strength suffered severe
shrinkages in their market quotations, thus making their owners believe
they were growing distinctly poorer. In reality the owners were better
off with the listed securities, despite the low prices of these. For if
they had wanted to, or were compelled to, they could at least have sold
the issues—possibly to exchange them for even better bargains. Or they
could just as logically have ignored the market’s action as temporary
and basically meaningless. But it is self-deception to tell yourself
that you have suffered no shrinkage in value merely because your
securities have no quoted market at all.</p>
<p>Returning to our A. andandandand P. shareholder in 1938, we assert
that as long as he held on to his shares he suffered no loss in their
price decline, beyond what his own judgment may have told him was
occasioned by a shrinkage in their underlying or intrinsic value. If no
such shrinkage had occurred, he had a right to expect that in due course
the market quotation would return to the 1937 level or better—as in fact
it did the following year. In this respect his position was at least as
good as if he had owned an interest in a private business with no quoted
market for its shares. For in that case, too, he might or might not have
been justified in mentally lopping off part of the cost of his holdings
because of the impact of the 1938 recession—depending on what had
happened to his company.</p>
<p>Critics of the value approach to stock investment argue that listed
common stocks cannot properly be regarded or appraised in the same way
as an interest in a similar private enterprise, because the presence of
an organized security market “injects into equity ownership the new and
extremely important attribute of liquidity.” But what this liquidity
really means is, first, that the investor has the benefit of the stock
market’s daily and changing appraisal of his holdings, for whatever that
appraisal may be worth, and, second, that the investor is able to
increase or decrease his investment at the market’s daily figure—if he
chooses. Thus the existence of a quoted market gives the investor
certain options that he does not have if his security is unquoted. But
it does not impose the current quotation on an investor who prefers to
take his idea of value from some other source.</p>
<p>Let us close this section with something in the nature of a parable.
Imagine that in some private business you own a small share that cost
you ,000. One of your partners, named Mr. Market, is very obliging
indeed. Every day he tells you what he thinks your interest is worth and
furthermore offers either to buy you out or to sell you an additional
interest on that basis. Sometimes his idea of value appears plausible
and justified by business developments and prospects as you know them.
Often, on the other hand, Mr. Market lets his enthusiasm or his fears
run away with him, and the value he proposes seems to you a little short
of silly.</p>
<p>If you are a prudent investor or a sensible businessman, will you let
Mr. Market’s daily communication determine your view of the value of a
,000 interest in the enterprise? Only in case you agree with him, or in
case you want to trade with him. You may be happy to sell out to him
when he quotes you a ridiculously high price, and equally happy to buy
from him when his price is low. But the rest of the time you will be
wiser to form your own ideas of the value of your holdings, based on
full reports from the company about its operations and financial
position.</p>
<p>The true investor is in that very position when he owns a listed
common stock. He can take advantage of the daily market price or leave
it alone, as dictated by his own judgment and inclination. He must take
cognizance of important price movements, for otherwise his judgment will
have nothing to work on. Conceivably they may give him a warning signal
which he will do well to heed—this in plain English means that he is to
sell his shares because the price has gone down, foreboding worse things
to come. In our view such signals are misleading at least as often as
they are helpful. Basically, price fluctuations have only one
significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an
opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely
when they advance a great deal. At other times he will do better if he
forgets about the stock market and pays attention to his dividend
returns and to the operating results of his companies.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>The most realistic distinction between the investor and the
speculator is found in their attitude toward stock-market movements. The
speculator’s primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting from
market fluctuations. The investor’s primary interest lies in acquiring
and holding suitable securities at suitable prices. Market movements are
important to him in a practical sense, because they alternately create
low price levels at which he would be wise to buy and high price levels
at which he certainly should refrain from buying and probably would be
wise to sell.</p>
<p>It is far from certain that the typical investor should regularly
hold off buying until low market levels appear, because this may involve
a long wait, very likely the loss of income, and the possible missing of
investment opportunities. On the whole it may be better for the investor
to do his stock buying whenever he has money to put in stocks, except
when the general market level is much higher than can be justified by
well-established standards of value. If he wants to be shrewd he can
look for the ever-present bargain opportunities in individual
securities.</p>
<p>Aside from forecasting the movements of the general market, much
effort and ability are directed on Wall Street toward selecting stocks
or industrial groups that in matter of price will “do better” than the
rest over a fairly short period in the future. Logical as this endeavor
may seem, we do not believe it is suited to the needs or temperament of
the true investor—particularly since he would be competing with a large
number of stock-market traders and first-class financial analysts who
are trying to do the same thing. As in all other activities that
emphasize price movements first and underlying values second, the work
of many intelligent minds constantly engaged in this field tends to be
self-neutralizing and self-defeating over the years.</p>
<p>The investor with a portfolio of sound stocks should expect their
prices to fluctuate and should neither be concerned by sizable declines
nor become excited by sizable advances. He should always remember that
market quotations are there for his convenience, either to be taken
advantage of or to be ignored. He should never buy a stock because it
has gone up or sell one because it has gone down. He would not be far
wrong if this motto read more simply: “Never buy a stock immediately
after a substantial rise or sell one immediately after a substantial
drop.”</p>
<p>An Added Consideration</p>
<p>Something should be said about the significance of average market
prices as a measure of managerial competence. The shareholder judges
whether his own investment has been successful in terms both of
dividends received and of the long-range trend of the average market
value. The same criteria should logically be applied in testing the
effectiveness of a company’s management and the soundness of its
attitude toward the owners of the business.</p>
<p>This statement may sound like a truism, but it needs to be
emphasized. For as yet there is no accepted technique or approach by
which management is brought to the bar of market opinion. On the
contrary, managements have always insisted that they have no
responsibility of any kind for what happens to the market value of their
shares. It is true, of course, that they are not accountable for those
fluctuations in price which, as we have been insisting, bear no
relationship to underlying conditions and values. But it is only the
lack of alertness and intelligence among the rank and file of
shareholders that permits this immunity to extend to the entire realm of
market quotations, including the permanent establishment of a
depreciated and unsatisfactory price level. Good managements produce a
good average market price, and bad managements produce bad market
prices.*</p>
<p>Fluctuations in Bond Prices</p>
<p>The investor should be aware that even though safety of its principal
and interest may be unquestioned, a long-term bond could vary widely in
market price in response to changes in interest rates. In Table 8-1 we
give data for various years back to 1902 covering yields for high-grade
corporate and tax-free issues. As individual illustrations we add the
price fluctuations of two representative railroad issues for a similar
period. (These are the Atchison, Topeka andandandand Santa Fe general
mortgage 4s, due 1995, for generations one of our premier noncallable
bond issues, and the Northern Pacific Ry. 3s, due 2047—originally a
150-year maturity!—long a typical Baarated bond.)</p>
<p>Because of their inverse relationship the low yields correspond to
the high prices and vice versa. The decline in the Northern Pacific 3s
in 1940 represented mainly doubts as to the safety of the issue. It is
extraordinary that the price recovered to an all-time high in the next
few years, and then lost two-thirds of its price chiefly because of the
rise in general interest rates. There have been startling variations, as
well, in the price of even the highest-grade bonds in the past forty
years.</p>
<p>Note that bond prices do not fluctuate in the same (inverse)
proportion as the calculated yields, because their fixed maturity value
of 100% exerts a moderating influence. However, for very long
maturities, as in our Northern Pacific example, prices and yields change
at close to the same rate.</p>
<p>Since 1964 record movements in both directions have taken place in
the high-grade bond market. Taking “prime municipals” (tax-free) as an
example, their yield more than doubled, from 3.2% in January 1965 to 7%
in June 1970. Their price index declined, correspondingly, from 110.8 to
67.5. In mid-1970 the yields on high-grade long-term bonds were higher
than at any time in the nearly 200 years of this country’s economic
history. * Twenty-five years earlier, just before our protracted bull
market began, bond yields were at their lowest point in history;
long-term municipals returned as little as 1%, and industrials gave
2.40% compared with the 4½ to 5% formerly considered “normal.” Those of
us with a long experience on Wall Street had seen Newton’s law of
“action and reaction, equal and opposite” work itself out repeatedly in
the stock market—the most noteworthy example being the rise in the DJIA
from 64 in 1921 to 381 in 1929, followed by a record collapse to 41 in
1932. But this time the widest pendulum swings took place in the usually
staid and slow-moving array of high-grade bond prices and yields. Moral:
Nothing important on Wall Street can be counted on to occur exactly in
the same way as it happened before. This represents the first half of
our favorite dictum: “The more it changes, the more it’s the same
thing.”</p>
<p>If it is virtually impossible to make worthwhile predictions about
the price movements of stocks, it is completely impossible to do so for
bonds.* In the old days, at least, one could often find a useful clue to
the coming end of a bull or bear market by studying the prior action of
bonds, but no similar clues were given to a coming change in interest
rates and bond prices. Hence the investor must choose between long-term
and short-term bond investments on the basis chiefly of his personal
preferences. If he wants to be certain that the market values will not
decrease, his best choices are probably U.S. savings bonds, Series E or
H, which were described above, p. 93. Either issue will give him a 5%
yield (after the first year), the Series E for up to 5 5/6 years, the
Series H for up to ten years, with a guaranteed resale value of cost or
better.</p>
<p>If the investor wants the 7.5% now available on good long-term
corporate bonds, or the 5.3% on tax-free municipals, he must be prepared
to see them fluctuate in price. Banks and insurance companies have the
privilege of valuing high-rated bonds of this type on the mathematical
basis of “amortized cost,” which disregards market prices; it would not
be a bad idea for the individual investor to do something similar.</p>
<p>The price fluctuations of convertible bonds and preferred stocks are
the resultant of three different factors: (1) variations in the price of
the related common stock, (2) variations in the credit standing of the
company, and (3) variations in general interest rates. A good many of
the convertible issues have been sold by companies that have credit
ratings well below the best.3 Some of these were badly affected by the
financial squeeze in 1970. As a result, convertible issues as a whole
have been subjected to triply unsettling influences in recent years, and
price variations have been unusually wide. In the typical case,
therefore, the investor would delude himself if he expected to find in
convertible issues that ideal combination of the safety of a high-grade
bond and price protection plus a chance to benefit from an advance in
the price of the common.</p>
<p>This may be a good place to make a suggestion about the “long-term
bond of the future.” Why should not the effects of changing interest
rates be divided on some practical and equitable basis between the
borrower and the lender? One possibility would be to sell long-term
bonds with interest payments that vary with an appropriate index of the
going rate. The main results of such an arrangement would be: (1) the
investor’s bond would always have a principal value of about 100, if the
company maintains its credit rating, but the interest received will
vary, say, with the rate offered on conventional new issues; (2) the
corporation would have the advantages of long-term debt—being spared
problems and costs of frequent renewals of refinancing—but its interest
costs would change from year to year.4</p>
<p>Over the past decade the bond investor has been confronted by an
increasingly serious dilemma: Shall he choose complete stability of
principal value, but with varying and usually low (short-term) interest
rates? Or shall he choose a fixed-interest income, with considerable
variations (usually downward, it seems) in his principal value? It would
be good for most investors if they could compromise between these
extremes, and be assured that neither their interest return nor their
principal value will fall below a stated minimum over, say, a 20-year
period. This could be arranged, without great difficulty, in an
appropriate bond contract of a new form. Important note: In effect the
U.S. government has done a similar thing in its combination of the
original savings-bonds contracts with their extensions at higher
interest rates. The suggestion we make here would cover a longer fixed
investment period than the savings bonds, and would introduce more
flexibility in the interest-rate provisions.*</p>
<p>It is hardly worthwhile to talk about nonconvertible preferred
stocks, since their special tax status makes the safe ones much more
desirable holdings by corporations—e.g., insurance companies— than by
individuals. The poorer-quality ones almost always fluctuate over a wide
range, percentagewise, not too differently from common stocks. We can
offer no other useful remark about them. Table 16-2 below, p. 406, gives
some information on the price changes of lower-grade nonconvertible
preferreds between December 1968 and December 1970. The average decline
was 17%, against 11.3% for the S andandandand P composite index of
common stocks.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 8</p>
<p>The happiness of those who want to be popular depends on others; the

<p>—Marcus Aurelius</p>
<p>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Market</p>
<p>Most of the time, the market is mostly accurate in pricing most
stocks. Millions of buyers and sellers haggling over price do a
remarkably good job of valuing companies—on average. But sometimes, the
price is not right; occasionally, it is very wrong indeed. And at such
times, you need to understand Graham’s image of Mr. Market, probably the
most brilliant metaphor ever created for explaining how stocks can
become mispriced.1 The manic-depressive Mr. Market does not always price
stocks the way an appraiser or a private buyer would value a business.
Instead, when stocks are going up, he happily pays more than their
objective value; and, when they are going down, he is desperate to dump
them for less than their true worth.</p>
<p>Is Mr. Market still around? Is he still bipolar? You bet he is.</p>
<p>On March 17, 2000, the stock of Inktomi Corp. hit a new high of
31.625. Since they first came on the market in June 1998, shares in the
Internet-searching software company had gained roughly 1,900%. Just in
the few weeks since December 1999, the stock had nearly tripled.</p>
<p>What was going on at Inktomi the business that could make Inktomi the
stock so valuable? The answer seems obvious: phenomenally fast growth.
In the three months ending in December 1999, Inktomi sold 6 million in
products and services, more than it had in the entire year ending in
December 1998. If Inktomi could sustain its growth rate of the previous
12 months for just five more years, its revenues would explode from 6
million a quarter to billion a month. With such growth in sight, the
faster the stock went up, the farther up it seemed certain to go.</p>
<p>But in his wild love affair with Inktomi’s stock, Mr. Market was
overlooking something about its business. The company was losing
money—lots of it. It had lost million in the most recent quarter, 4
million in the 12 months before that, and 4 million in the year before
that. In its entire corporate lifetime, Inktomi had never made a dime in
profits. Yet, on March 17, 2000, Mr. Market valued this tiny business at
a total of 5 billion. (Yes, that’s billion, with a B.)</p>
<p>And then Mr. Market went into a sudden, nightmarish depression. On
September 30, 2002, just two and a half years after hitting 31.625 per
share, Inktomi’s stock closed at 25 cents—collapsing from a total market
value of 5 billion to less than 0 million. Had Inktomi’s business dried
up? Not at all; over the previous 12 months, the company had generated
13 million in revenues. So what had changed? Only Mr. Market’s mood: In
early 2000, investors were so wild about the Internet that they priced
Inktomi’s shares at 250 times the company’s revenues. Now, however, they
would pay only 0.35 times its revenues. Mr. Market had morphed from
Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde and was ferociously trashing every stock that had
made a fool out of him.</p>
<p>But Mr. Market was no more justified in his midnight rage than he had
been in his manic euphoria. On December 23, 2002, Yahoo! Inc. announced
that it would buy Inktomi for .65 per share. That was nearly seven times
Inktomi’s stock price on September 30. History will probably show that
Yahoo! got a bargain. When Mr. Market makes stocks so cheap, it’s no
wonder that entire companies get bought right out from under him.2</p>
<p>Think for Yourself</p>
<p>Would you willingly allow a certifiable lunatic to come by at least
five times a week to tell you that you should feel exactly the way he
feels? Would you ever agree to be euphoric just because he is—or
miserable just because he thinks you should be? Of course not. You’d
insist on your right to take control of your own emotional life, based
on your experiences and your beliefs. But, when it comes to their
financial lives, millions of people let Mr. Market tell them how to feel
and what to do—despite the obvious fact that, from time to time, he can
get nuttier than a fruitcake.</p>
<p>In 1999, when Mr. Market was squealing with delight, American
employees directed an average of 8.6% of their paychecks into their
401(k) retirement plans. By 2002, after Mr. Market had spent three years
stuffing stocks into black garbage bags, the average contribution rate
had dropped by nearly one-quarter, to just 7%.3 The cheaper stocks got,
the less eager people became to buy them—because they were imitating
Mr. Market, instead of thinking for themselves.</p>
<p>The intelligent investor shouldn’t ignore Mr. Market entirely.
Instead, you should do business with him—but only to the extent that it
serves your interests. Mr. Market’s job is to provide you with prices;
your job is to decide whether it is to your advantage to act on them.
You do not have to trade with him just because he constantly begs you
to.</p>
<p>By refusing to let Mr. Market be your master, you transform him into
your servant. After all, even when he seems to be destroying values, he
is creating them elsewhere. In 1999, the Wilshire 5000 index—the
broadest measure of U.S. stock performance—gained 23.8%, powered by
technology and telecommunications stocks. But 3,743 of the 7,234 stocks
in the Wilshire index went down in value even as the average was rising.
While those high-tech and telecom stocks were hotter than the hood of a
race car on an August afternoon, thousands of “Old Economy” shares were
frozen in the mud—getting cheaper and cheaper.</p>
<p>The stock of CMGI, an “incubator” or holding company for Internet
start-up firms, went up an astonishing 939.9% in 1999. Meanwhile,
Berkshire Hathaway—the holding company through which Graham’s greatest
disciple, Warren Buffett, owns such Old Economy stalwarts as Coca-Cola,
Gillette, and the Washington Post Co.—dropped by 24.9%.4</p>
<p>But then, as it so often does, the market had a sudden mood swing.
Figure 8-1 offers a sampling of how the stinkers of 1999 became the
stars of 2000 through 2002.</p>
<p>As for those two holding companies, CMGI went on to lose 96% in 2000,
another 70.9% in 2001, and still 39.8% more in 2002—a cumulative loss of
99.3%. Berkshire Hathaway went up 26.6% in 2000 and 6.5% in 2001, then
had a slight 3.8% loss in 2002—a cumulative gain of 30%.</p>
<p>Can You Beat the Pros at Their Own Game?</p>
<p>One of Graham’s most powerful insights is this: “The investor who
permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified market
declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advantage
into a basic disadvantage.”</p>
<p>What does Graham mean by those words “basic advantage”? He means that
the intelligent individual investor has the full freedom to choose
whether or not to follow Mr. Market. You have the luxury of being able
to think for yourself.5</p>
<p>The typical money manager, however, has no choice but to mimic
Mr. Market’s every move—buying high, selling low, marching almost
mindlessly in his erratic footsteps. Here are some of the handicaps
mutual-fund managers and other professional investors are saddled
with:</p>
<p>With billions of dollars under management, they must gravitate toward
the biggest stocks—the only ones they can buy in the multimillion-dollar
quantities they need to fill their portfolios. Thus many funds end up
owning the same few overpriced giants.</p>
<p>Investors tend to pour more money into funds as the market rises. The
managers use that new cash to buy more of the stocks they already own,
driving prices to even more dangerous heights.</p>
<p>If fund investors ask for their money back when the market drops, the
managers may need to sell stocks to cash them out. Just as the funds are
forced to buy stocks at inflated prices in a rising market, they become
forced sellers as stocks get cheap again.</p>
<p>Many portfolio managers get bonuses for beating the market, so they
obsessively measure their returns against benchmarks like the S
andandandand P 500 index. If a company gets added to an index, hundreds
of funds compulsively buy it. (If they don’t, and that stock then does
well, the managers look foolish; on the other hand, if they buy it and
it does poorly, no one will blame them.)</p>
<p>Increasingly, fund managers are expected to specialize. Just as in
medicine the general practitioner has given way to the pediatric
allergist and the geriatric otolaryngologist, fund managers must buy
only “small growth” stocks, or only “mid-sized value” stocks, or nothing
but “large blend” stocks.6 If a company gets too big, or too small, or
too cheap, or an itty bit too expensive, the fund has to sell it—even if
the manager loves the stock.</p>
<p>So there’s no reason you can’t do as well as the pros. What you
cannot do (despite all the pundits who say you can) is to “beat the pros
at their own game.” The pros can’t even win their own game! Why should
you want to play it at all? If you follow their rules, you will
lose—since you will end up as much a slave to Mr. Market as the
professionals are.</p>
<p>Instead, recognize that investing intelligently is about controlling
the controllable. You can’t control whether the stocks or funds you buy
will outper-forms the market today, next week, this month, or this year;
in the short run, your returns will always be hostage to Mr. Market and
his whims. But you can control:</p>
<p>your brokerage costs, by trading rarely, patiently, and cheaply</p>
<p>your ownership costs, by refusing to buy mutual funds with excessive
annual expenses</p>
<p>your expectations, by using realism, not fantasy, to forecast your
returns7</p>
<p>your risk, by deciding how much of your total assets to put at hazard
in the stock market, by diversifying, and by rebalancing</p>
<p>your tax bills, by holding stocks for at least one year and, whenever
possible, for at least five years, to lower your capital-gains
liability</p>
<p>and, most of all, your own behavior.</p>
<p>If you listen to financial TV, or read most market columnists, you’d
think that investing is some kind of sport, or a war, or a struggle for
survival in a hostile wilderness. But investing isn’t about beating
others at their game. It’s about controlling yourself at your own game.
The challenge for the intelligent investor is not to find the stocks
that will go up the most and down the least, but rather to prevent
yourself from being your own worst enemy—from buying high just because
Mr. Market says “Buy!” and from selling low just because Mr. Market says
“Sell!”</p>
<p>If you investment horizon is long—at least 25 or 30 years—there is
only one sensible approach: Buy every month, automatically, and whenever
else you can spare some money. The single best choice for this lifelong
holding is a total stock-market index fund. Sell only when you need the
cash (for a psychological boost, clip out and sign your “Investment
Owner’s Contract”—which you can find on p. 225).</p>
<p>To be an intelligent investor, you must also refuse to judge your
financial success by how a bunch of total strangers are doing. You’re
not one penny poorer if someone in Dubuque or Dallas or Denver beats the
S andandandand P 500 and you don’t. No one’s gravestone reads “HE BEAT
THE MARKET.”</p>
<p>I once interviewed a group of retirees in Boca Raton, one of
Florida’s wealthiest retirement communities. I asked these people—mostly
in their seventies—if they had beaten the market over their investing
lifetimes. Some said yes, some said no; most weren’t sure. Then one man
said, “Who cares? All I know is, my investments earned enough for me to
end up in Boca.”</p>
<p>Could there be a more perfect answer? After all, the whole point of
investing is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough
money to meet your own needs. The best way to measure your investing
success is not by whether you’re beating the market but by whether
you’ve put in place a financial plan and a behavioral discipline that
are likely to get you where you want to go. In the end, what matters
isn’t crossing the finish line before anybody else but just making sure
that you do cross it.8</p>
<p>Your Money and Your Brain</p>
<p>Why, then, do investors find Mr. Market so seductive? It turns out
that our brains are hardwired to get us into investing trouble; humans
are pattern-seeking animals. Psychologists have shown that if you
present people with a random sequence—and tell them that it’s
unpredictable—they will nevertheless insist on trying to guess what’s
coming next. Likewise, we “know” that the next roll of the dice will be
a seven, that a baseball player is due for a base hit, that the next
winning number in the Powerball lottery will definitely be
4-27-9-16-42-10—and that this hot little stock is the next
Microsoft.</p>
<p>Groundbreaking new research in neuroscience shows that our brains are
designed to perceive trends even where they might not exist. After an
event occurs just two or three times in a row, regions of the human
brain called the anterior cingulate and nucleus accumbens automatically
anticipate that it will happen again. If it does repeat, a natural
chemical called dopamine is released, flooding your brain with a soft
euphoria. Thus, if a stock goes up a few times in a row, you reflexively
expect it to keep going—and your brain chemistry changes as the stock
rises, giving you a “natural high.” You effectively become addicted to
your own predictions.</p>
<p>But when stocks drop, that financial loss fires up your amygdala—the
part of the brain that processes fear and anxiety and generates the
famous “fight or flight” response that is common to all cornered
animals. Just as you can’t keep your heart rate from rising if a fire
alarm goes off, just as you can’t avoid flinching if a rattlesnake
slithers onto your hiking path, you can’t help feeling fearful when
stock prices are plunging.9</p>
<p>In fact, the brilliant psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky
have shown that the pain of financial loss is more than twice as intense
as the pleasure of an equivalent gain. Making ,000 on a stock feels
great—but a ,000 loss wields an emotional wallop more than twice as
powerful. Losing money is so painful that many people, terrified at the
prospect of any further loss, sell out near the bottom or refuse to buy
more.</p>
<p>That helps explain why we fixate on the raw magnitude of a market
decline and forget to put the loss in proportion. So, if a TV reporter
hollers, “The market is plunging—the Dow is down 100 points!” most
people instinctively shudder. But, at the Dow’s recent level of 8,000,
that’s a drop of just 1.2%. Now think how ridiculous it would sound if,
on a day when it’s 81 degrees outside, the TV weatherman shrieked, “The
temperature is plunging—it’s dropped from 81 degrees to 80 degrees!”
That, too, is a 1.2% drop. When you forget to view changing market
prices in percentage terms, it’s all too easy to panic over minor
vibrations. (If you have decades of investing ahead of you, there’s a
better way to visualize the financial news broadcasts; see the sidebar
on p. 222.)</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, many people came to feel that they were in the
dark unless they checked the prices of their stocks several times a day.
But, as Graham puts it, the typical investor “would be better off if his
stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would then be spared the
mental anguish caused him by other persons’ mistakes of judgment.” If,
after checking the value of your stock portfolio at 1:24 P.M., you feel
compelled to check it all over again at 1:37 P.M., ask yourself these
questions:</p>
<p>NEWS YOU COULD USE</p>
<p>Stocks are crashing, so you turn on the television to catch the
latest market news. But instead of CNBC or CNN, imagine that you can
tune in to the Benjamin Graham Financial Network. On BGFN, the audio
doesn’t capture that famous sour clang of the market’s closing bell; the
video doesn’t home in on brokers scurrying across the floor of the stock
exchange like angry rodents. Nor does BGFN run any footage of investors
gasping on frozen sidewalks as red arrows whiz overhead on electronic
stock tickers.</p>
<p>Instead, the image that fills your TV screen is the facade of the New
York Stock Exchange, festooned with a huge banner reading: “SALE! 50%
OFF!” As intro music, Bachman-Turner Overdrive can be heard blaring a
few bars of their old barn-burner, “You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yet.” Then
the anchorman announces brightly, “Stocks became more attractive yet
again today, as the Dow dropped another 2.5% on heavy volume—the fourth
day in a row that stocks have gotten cheaper. Tech investors fared even
better, as leading companies like Microsoft lost nearly 5% on the day,
making them even more affordable. That comes on top of the good news of
the past year, in which stocks have already lost 50%, putting them at
bargain levels not seen in years. And some prominent analysts are
optimistic that prices may drop still further in the weeks and months to
come.”</p>
<p>The newscast cuts over to market strategist Ignatz Anderson of the
Wall Street firm of Ketchum andandandand Skinner, who says, “My forecast
is for stocks to lose another 15% by June. I’m cautiously optimistic
that if everything goes well, stocks could lose 25%, maybe more.”</p>
<p>“Let’s hope Ignatz Anderson is right,” the anchor says cheerily.
“Falling stock prices would be fabulous news for any investor with a
very long horizon. And now over to Wally Wood for our exclusive
AccuWeather forecast.”</p>
<p>Did I call a real-estate agent to check the market price of my house
at 1:24 P.M.? Did I call back at 1:37 P.M.?</p>
<p>If I had, would the price have changed? If it did, would I have
rushed to sell my house?</p>
<p>By not checking, or even knowing, the market price of my house from
minute to minute, do I prevent its value from rising over time?10</p>
<p>The only possible answer to these questions is of course not! And you
should view your portfolio the same way. Over a 10- or 20- or 30- year
investment horizon, Mr. Market’s daily dipsy-doodles simply do not
matter. In any case, for anyone who will be investing for years to come,
falling stock prices are good news, not bad, since they enable you to
buy more for less money. The longer and further stocks fall, and the
more steadily you keep buying as they drop, the more money you will make
in the end—if you remain steadfast until the end. Instead of fearing a
bear market, you should embrace it. The intelligent investor should be
perfectly comfortable owning a stock or mutual fund even if the stock
market stopped supplying daily prices for the next 10 years.11</p>
<p>Paradoxically, “you will be much more in control,” explains
neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, “if you realize how much you are not in
control.” By acknowledging your biological tendency to buy high and sell
low, you can admit the need to dollar-cost average, rebalance, and sign
an investment contract. By putting much of your portfolio on permanent
autopilot, you can fight the prediction addiction, focus on your
long-term financial goals, and tune out Mr. Market’s mood swings.</p>
<p>When Mr. Market Gives You Lemons, Make Lemonade</p>
<p>Although Graham teaches that you should buy when Mr. Market is
yelling “sell,” there’s one exception the intelligent investor needs to
understand. Selling into a bear market can make sense if it creates a
tax windfall. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows you to use your
realized losses (any declines in value that you lock in by selling your
shares) to offset up to ,000 in ordinary income.12 Let’s say you bought
200 shares of Coca-Cola stock in January 2000 for 0 a share—a total
investment of 2,000. By year-end 2002, the stock was down to 4 a share,
or ,800 for your lot—a loss of ,200.</p>
<p>You could have done what most people do—either whine about your loss,
or sweep it under the rug and pretend it never happened. Or you could
have taken control. Before 2002 ended, you could have sold all your Coke
shares, locking in the ,200 loss. Then, after waiting 31 days to comply
with IRS rules, you would buy 200 shares of Coke all over again. The
result: You would be able to reduce your taxable income by ,000 in 2002,
and you could use the remaining 00 loss to offset your income in 2003.
And better yet, you would still own a company whose future you believe
in—but now you would own it for almost one-third less than you paid the
first time.13</p>
<p>With Uncle Sam subsidizing your losses, it can make sense to sell and
lock in a loss. If Uncle Sam wants to make Mr. Market look logical by
comparison, who are we to complain?</p>
<p>Investment Owner’s Contract</p>
<p>I, _____________ ___________________, hereby state that I am an
investor who is seeking to accumulate wealth for many years into the
future.</p>
<p>I know that there will be many times when I will be tempted to invest
in stocks or bonds because they have gone (or “are going”) up in price,
and other times when I will be tempted to sell my investments because
they have gone (or “are going”) down.</p>
<p>I hereby declare my refusal to let a herd of strangers make my
financial decisions for me. I further make a solemn commitment never to
invest because the stock market has gone up, and never to sell because
it has gone down. Instead, I will invest .00 per month, every month,
through an automatic investment plan or “dollar-cost averaging program,”
into the following mutual fund(s) or diversified portfolio(s):</p>
<p>_________________________________,</p>
<p>_________________________________,</p>
<p>_________________________________.</p>
<p>I will also invest additional amounts whenever I can afford to spare
the cash (and can afford to lose it in the short run).</p>
<p>I hereby declare that I will hold each of these investments
continually through at least the following date (which must be a minimum
of 10 years after the date of this contact): _________________ _____,
20__. The only exceptions allowed under the terms of this contract are a
sudden, pressing need for cash, like a health-care emergency or the loss
of my job, or a planned expenditure like a housing down payment or a
tuition bill.</p>
<p>I am, by signing below, stating my intention not only to abide by the
terms of this contract, but to re-read this document whenever I am
tempted to sell any of my investments.</p>
<p>This contract is valid only when signed by at least one witness, and
must be kept in a safe place that is easily accessible for future
reference.</p>
