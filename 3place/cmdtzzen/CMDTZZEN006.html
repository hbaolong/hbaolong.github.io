<h4 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h4>
<p>The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks</p>
<p>Investment Merits of Common Stocks</p>
<p>In our first edition (1949) we found it necessary at this point to
insert a long exposition of the case for including a substantial
common-stock component in all investment portfolios.* Common stocks were
generally viewed as highly speculative and therefore unsafe; they had
declined fairly substantially from the high levels of 1946, but instead
of attracting investors to them because of their reasonable prices, this
fall had had the opposite effect of undermining confidence in equity
securities. We have commented on the converse situation that has
developed in the ensuing 20 years, whereby the big advance in stock
prices made them appear safe and profitable investments at record high
levels which might actually carry with them a considerable degree of
risk.†</p>
<p>The argument we made for common stocks in 1949 turned on two main
points. The first was that they had offered a considerable degree of
protection against the erosion of the investor’s dollar caused by
inflation, whereas bonds offered no protection at all. The second
advantage of common stocks lay in their higher average return to
investors over the years. This was produced both by an average dividend
income exceeding the yield on good bonds and by an underlying tendency
for market value to increase over the years in consequence of the
reinvestment of undistributed profits.</p>
<p>While these two advantages have been of major importance—and have
given common stocks a far better record than bonds over the long-term
past—we have consistently warned that these benefits could be lost by
the stock buyer if he pays too high a price for his shares. This was
clearly the case in 1929, and it took 25 years for the market level to
climb back to the ledge from which it had abysmally fallen in
1929–1932.* Since 1957 common stocks have once again, through their high
prices, lost their traditional advantage in dividend yield over bond
interest rates.† It remains to be seen whether the inflation factor and
the economic-growth factor will make up in the future for this
significantly adverse development.</p>
<p>It should be evident to the reader that we have no enthusiasm for
common stocks in general at the 900 DJIA level of late 1971. For reasons
already given* we feel that the defensive investor cannot afford to be
without an appreciable proportion of common stocks in his portfolio,
even if he must regard them as the lesser of two evils—the greater being
the risks attached to an all-bond holding.</p>
<p>Rules for the Common-Stock Component</p>
<p>The selection of common stocks for the portfolio of the defensive
investor should be a relatively simple matter. Here we would suggest
four rules to be followed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There should be adequate though not excessive diversification.
This might mean a minimum of ten different issues and a maximum of about
thirty.†</p></li>
<li><p>Each company selected should be large, prominent, and
conservatively financed. Indefinite as these adjectives must be, their
general sense is clear. Observations on this point are added at the end
of the chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Each company should have a long record of continuous dividend
payments. (All the issues in the Dow Jones Industrial Aver age met this
dividend requirement in 1971.) To be specific on this point we would
suggest the requirement of continuous dividend payments beginning at
least in 1950.*</p></li>
<li><p>The investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay
for an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the past
seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such average
earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last twelve-month
period. But such a restriction would eliminate nearly all the strongest
and most popular companies from the portfolio. In particular, it would
ban virtually the entire category of “growth stocks,” which have for
some years past been the favorites of both speculators and institutional
investors. We must give our reasons for proposing so drastic an
exclusion.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Growth Stocks and the Defensive Investor</p>
<p>The term “growth stock” is applied to one which has increased its
per-share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common stocks
generally and is expected to continue to do so in the future. (Some
authorities would say that a true growth stock should be expected at
least to double its per-share earnings in ten years—i.e., to increase
them at a compounded annual rate of over 7.1%.)† Obviously stocks of
this kind are attractive to buy and to own, provided the price paid is
not excessive. The problem lies there, of course, since growth stocks
have long sold at high prices in relation to current earnings and at
much higher multiples of their average profits over a past period. This
has introduced a speculative element of considerable weight in the
growth-stock picture and has made successful operations in this field a
far from simple matter.</p>
<p>The leading growth issue has long been International Business
Machines, and it has brought phenomenal rewards to those who bought it
years ago and held on to it tenaciously. But we have already pointed
out* that this “best of common stocks” actually lost 50% of its market
price in a six-months’ decline during 1961–62 and nearly the same
percentage in 1969–70. Other growth stocks have been even more
vulnerable to adverse developments; in some cases not only has the price
fallen back but the earnings as well, thus causing a double discomfiture
to those who owned them. A good second example for our purpose is Texas
Instruments, which in six years rose from 5 to 256, without paying a
dividend, while its earnings increased from 40 cents to .91 per share.
(Note that the price advanced five times as fast as the profits; this is
characteristic of popular common stocks.) But two years later the
earnings had dropped off by nearly 50% and the price by four-fifths, to
49.†</p>
<p>The reader will understand from these instances why we regard growth
stocks as a whole as too uncertain and risky a vehicle for the defensive
investor. Of course, wonders can be accomplished with the right
individual selections, bought at the right levels, and later sold after
a huge rise and before the probable decline. But the average investor
can no more expect to accomplish this than to find money growing on
trees. In contrast we think that the group of large companies that are
relatively unpopular, and therefore obtainable at reasonable earnings
multipliers,* offers a sound if unspectacular area of choice by the
general public. We shall illustrate this idea in our chapter on
portfolio selection.</p>
<p>Portfolio Changes</p>
<p>It is now standard practice to submit all security lists for periodic
inspection in order to see whether their quality can be improved. This,
of course, is a major part of the service provided for clients by
investment counselors. Nearly all brokerage houses are ready to make
corresponding suggestions, without special fee, in return for the
commission business involved. Some brokerage houses maintain investment
services on a fee basis.</p>
<p>Presumably our defensive investor should obtain—at least once a
year—the same kind of advice regarding changes in his portfolio as he
sought when his funds were first committed. Since he will have little
expertness of his own on which to rely, it is essential that he entrust
himself only to firms of the highest reputation; otherwise he may easily
fall into incompetent or unscrupulous hands. It is important, in any
case, that at every such consultation he make clear to his adviser that
he wishes to adhere closely to the four rules of common-stock selection
given earlier in this chapter. Incidentally, if his list has been
competently selected in the first instance, there should be no need for
frequent or numerous changes.†</p>
<p>Dollar-Cost Averaging</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange has put considerable effort into
popularizing its “monthly purchase plan,” under which an investor
devotes the same dollar amount each month to buying one or more common
stocks. This is an application of a special type of “formula investment”
known as dollar-cost averaging. During the predominantly rising-market
experience since 1949 the results from such a procedure were certain to
be highly satisfactory, especially since they prevented the practitioner
from concentrating his buying at the wrong times.</p>
<p>In Lucile Tomlinson’s comprehensive study of formula investment
plans,1 the author presented a calculation of the results of dollar-cost
averaging in the group of stocks making up the Dow Jones industrial
index. Tests were made covering 23 ten-year purchase periods, the first
ending in 1929, the last in 1952. Every test showed a profit either at
the close of the purchase period or within five years thereafter. The
average indicated profit at the end of the 23 buying periods was 21.5%,
exclusive of dividends received. Needless to say, in some instances
there was a substantial temporary depreciation at market value. Miss
Tomlinson ends her discussion of this ultrasimple investment formula
with the striking sentence: “No one has yet discovered any other formula
for investing which can be used with so much confidence of ultimate
success, regardless of what may happen to security prices, as Dollar
Cost Averaging.”</p>
<p>It may be objected that dollar-cost averaging, while sound in
principle, is rather unrealistic in practice, because few people are so
situated that they can have available for common-stock investment the
same amount of money each year for, say, 20 years. It seems to me that
this apparent objection has lost much of its force in recent years.
Common stocks are becoming generally accepted as a necessary component
of a sound savings-investment program. Thus, systematic and uniform
purchases of common stocks may present no more psychological and
financial difficulties than similar continuous payments for United
States savings bonds and for life insurance—to which they should be
complementary. The monthly amount may be small, but the results after 20
or more years can be impressive and important to the saver.</p>
<p>The Investor’s Personal Situation</p>
<p>At the beginning of this chapter we referred briefly to the position
of the individual portfolio owner. Let us return to this matter, in the
light of our subsequent discussion of general policy. To what extent
should the type of securities selected by the investor vary with his
circumstances? As concrete examples representing widely different
conditions, we shall take: (1) a widow left 00,000 with which to support
herself and her children; (2) a successful doctor in mid-career, with
savings of 00,000 and yearly accretions of 0,000; and (3) a young man
earning 00 per week and saving ,000 a year.*</p>
<p>For the widow, the problem of living on her income is a very
difficult one. On the other hand the need for conservatism in her
investments is paramount. A division of her fund about equally between
United States bonds and first-grade common stocks is a compromise
between these objectives and corresponds to our general prescription for
the defensive investor. (The stock component may be placed as high as
75% if the investor is psychologically prepared for this decision, and
if she can be almost certain she is not buying at too high a level.
Assuredly this is not the case in early 1972.)</p>
<p>We do not preclude the possibility that the widow may qualify as an
enterprising investor, in which case her objectives and methods will be
quite different. The one thing the widow must not do is to take
speculative chances in order to “make some extra income.” By this we
mean trying for profits or high income without the necessary equipment
to warrant full confidence in overall success. It would be far better
for her to draw ,000 per year out of her principal, in order to make
both ends meet, than to risk half of it in poorly grounded, and
therefore speculative, ventures.</p>
<p>The prosperous doctor has none of the widow’s pressures and
compulsions, yet we believe that his choices are pretty much the same.
Is he willing to take a serious interest in the business of investment?
If he lacks the impulse or the flair, he will do best to accept the easy
role of the defensive investor. The division of his portfolio should
then be no different from that of the “typical” widow, and there would
be the same area of personal choice in fixing the size of the stock
component. The annual savings should be invested in about the same
proportions as the total fund.</p>
<p>The average doctor may be more likely than the average widow to elect
to become an enterprising investor, and he is perhaps more likely to
succeed in the undertaking. He has one important handicap, however—the
fact that he has less time available to give to his investment education
and to the administration of his funds. In fact, medical men have been
notoriously unsuccessful in their security dealings. The reason for this
is that they usually have an ample confidence in their own intelligence
and a strong desire to make a good return on their money, without the
realization that to do so successfully requires both considerable
attention to the matter and something of a professional approach to
security values.</p>
<p>Finally, the young man who saves ,000 a year—and expects to do better
gradually—finds himself with the same choices, though for still
different reasons. Some of his savings should go automatically into
Series E bonds. The balance is so modest that it seems hardly worthwhile
for him to undergo a tough educational and temperamental discipline in
order to qualify as an aggressive investor. Thus a simple resort to our
standard program for the defensive investor would be at once the easiest
and the most logical policy.</p>
<p>Let us not ignore human nature at this point. Finance has a
fascination for many bright young people with limited means. They would
like to be both intelligent and enterprising in the placement of their
savings, even though investment income is much less important to them
than their salaries. This attitude is all to the good. There is a great
advantage for the young capitalist to begin his financial education and
experience early. If he is going to operate as an aggressive investor he
is certain to make some mistakes and to take some losses. Youth can
stand these disappointments and profit by them. We urge the beginner in
security buying not to waste his efforts and his money in trying to beat
the market. Let him study security values and initially test out his
judgment on price versus value with the smallest possible sums.</p>
<p>Thus we return to the statement, made at the outset, that the kind of
securities to be purchased and the rate of return to be sought depend
not on the investor’s financial resources but on his financial equipment
in terms of knowledge, experience, and temperament.</p>
<p>Note on the Concept of “Risk”</p>
<p>It is conventional to speak of good bonds as less risky than good
preferred stocks and of the latter as less risky than good common
stocks. From this was derived the popular prejudice against common
stocks because they are not “safe,” which was demonstrated in the
Federal Reserve Board’s survey of 1948. We should like to point out that
the words “risk” and “safety” are applied to securities in two different
senses, with a resultant confusion in thought.</p>
<p>A bond is clearly proved unsafe when it defaults its interest or
principal payments. Similarly, if a preferred stock or even a common
stock is bought with the expectation that a given rate of dividend will
be continued, then a reduction or passing of the dividend means that it
has proved unsafe. It is also true that an investment contains a risk if
there is a fair possibility that the holder may have to sell at a time
when the price is well below cost.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the idea of risk is often extended to apply to a
possible decline in the price of a security, even though the decline may
be of a cyclical and temporary nature and even though the holder is
unlikely to be forced to sell at such times. These chances are present
in all securities, other than United States savings bonds, and to a
greater extent in the general run of common stocks than in senior issues
as a class. But we believe that what is here involved is not a true risk
in the useful sense of the term. The man who holds a mortgage on a
building might have to take a substantial loss if he were forced to sell
it at an unfavorable time. That element is not taken into account in
judging the safety or risk of ordinary real-estate mortgages, the only
criterion being the certainty of punctual payments. In the same way the
risk attached to an ordinary commercial business is measured by the
chance of its losing money, not by what would happen if the owner were
forced to sell.</p>
<p>In Chapter 8 we shall set forth our conviction that the bona fide
investor does not lose money merely because the market price of his
holdings declines; hence the fact that a decline may occur does not mean
that he is running a true risk of loss. If a group of well-selected
common-stock investments shows a satisfactory overall return, as
measured through a fair number of years, then this group investment has
proved to be “safe.” During that period its market value is bound to
fluctuate, and as likely as not it will sell for a while under the
buyer’s cost. If that fact makes the investment “risky,” it would then
have to be called both risky and safe at the same time. This confusion
may be avoided if we apply the concept of risk solely to a loss of value
which either is realized through actual sale, or is caused by a
significant deterioration in the company’s position—or, more frequently
perhaps, is the result of the payment of an excessive price in relation
to the intrinsic worth of the security.2</p>
<p>Many common stocks do involve risks of such deterioration. But it is
our thesis that a properly executed group investment in common stocks
does not carry any substantial risk of this sort and that therefore it
should not be termed “risky” merely because of the element of price
fluctuation. But such risk is present if there is danger that the price
may prove to have been clearly too high by intrinsic-value
standards—even if any subsequent severe market decline may be recouped
many years later.</p>
<p>Note on the Category of “Large, Prominent, and Conservatively
Financed Corporations”</p>
<p>The quoted phrase in our caption was used earlier in the chapter to
describe the kind of common stocks to which defensive investors should
limit their purchases—provided also that they had paid continuous
dividends for a considerable number of years. A criterion based on
adjectives is always ambiguous. Where is the dividing line for size, for
prominence, and for conservatism of financial structure? On the last
point we can suggest a specific standard that, though arbitrary, is in
line with accepted thinking. An industrial company’s finances are not
conservative unless the common stock (at book value) represents at least
half of the total capitalization, including all bank debt.3 For a
railroad or public utility the figure should be at least 30%.</p>
<p>The words “large” and “prominent” carry the notion of substantial
size combined with a leading position in the industry. Such companies
are often referred to as “primary”; all other common stocks are then
called “secondary,” except that growth stocks are ordinarily placed in a
separate class by those who buy them as such. To supply an element of
concreteness here, let us suggest that to be “large” in present-day
terms a company should have 0 million of assets or do 0 million of
business.* Again to be “prominent” a company should rank among the first
quarter or first third in size within its industry group.</p>
<p>It would be foolish, however, to insist upon such arbitrary criteria.
They are offered merely as guides to those who may ask for guidance. But
any rule which the investor may set for himself and which does no
violence to the common-sense meanings of “large” and “prominent” should
be acceptable. By the very nature of the case there must be a large
group of companies that some will and others will not include among
those suitable for defensive investment. There is no harm in such
diversity of opinion and action. In fact, it has a salutary effect upon
stock-market conditions, because it permits a gradual differentiation or
transition between the categories of primary and secondary stock
issues.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 5</p>
<p>Human felicity is produc’d not so much by great Pieces of good
Fortune that seldom happen, as by little Advantages that occur every
day.</p>
<p>—Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>The Best Defense is a Good Offense</p>
<p>After the stock-market bloodbath of the past few years, why would any
defensive investor put a dime into stocks?</p>
<p>First, remember Graham’s insistence that how defensive you should be
depends less on your tolerance for risk than on your willingness to put
time and energy into your portfolio. And if you go about it the right
way, investing in stocks is just as easy as parking your money in bonds
and cash. (As we’ll see in Chapter 9, you can buy a stock-market index
fund with no more effort than it takes to get dressed in the
morning.)</p>
<p>Amidst the bear market that began in 2000, it’s understandable if you
feel burned—and if, in turn, that feeling makes you determined never to
buy another stock again. As an old Turkish proverb says, “After you burn
your mouth on hot milk, you blow on your yogurt.” Because the crash of
2000–2002 was so terrible, many investors now view stocks as scaldingly
risky; but, paradoxically, the very act of crashing has taken much of
the risk out of the stock market. It was hot milk before, but it is
room-temperature yogurt now.</p>
<p>Viewed logically, the decision of whether to own stocks today has
nothing to do with how much money you might have lost by owning them a
few years ago. When stocks are priced reasonably enough to give you
future growth, then you should own them, regardless of the losses they
may have cost you in the recent past. That’s all the more true when bond
yields are low, reducing the future returns on income-producing
investments.</p>
<p>As we have seen in Chapter 3, stocks are (as of early 2003) only
mildly overpriced by historical standards. Meanwhile, at recent prices,
bonds offer such low yields that an investor who buys them for their
supposed safety is like a smoker who thinks he can protect himself
against lung cancer by smoking low-tar cigarettes. No matter how
defensive an investor you are—in Graham’s sense of low maintenance, or
in the contemporary sense of low risk—today’s values mean that you must
keep at least some of your money in stocks.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it’s never been easier for a defensive investor to buy
stocks. And a permanent autopilot portfolio, which effortlessly puts a
little bit of your money to work every month in predetermined
investments, can defend you against the need to dedicate a large part of
your life to stock picking.</p>
<p>Should You “Buy What You Know”?</p>
<p>But first, let’s look at something the defensive investor must always
defend against: the belief that you can pick stocks without doing any
homework. In the 1980s and early 1990s, one of the most popular
investing slogans was “buy what you know.” Peter Lynch—who from 1977
through 1990 piloted Fidelity Magellan to the best track record ever
compiled by a mutual fund—was the most charismatic preacher of this
gospel. Lynch argued that amateur investors have an advantage that
professional investors have forgotten how to use: “the power of common
knowledge.” If you discover a great new restaurant, car, toothpaste, or
jeans—or if you notice that the parking lot at a nearby business is
always full or that people are still working at a company’s headquarters
long after Jay Leno goes off the air—then you have a personal insight
into a stock that a professional analyst or portfolio manager might
never pick up on. As Lynch put it, “During a lifetime of buying cars or
cameras, you develop a sense of what’s good and what’s bad, what sells
and what doesn’t…and the most important part is, you know it before Wall
Street knows it.”1</p>
<p>Lynch’s rule—“You can outper-forms the experts if you use your edge
by investing in companies or industries you already understand”—isn’t
totally implausible, and thousands of investors have profited from it
over the years. But Lynch’s rule can work only if you follow its
corollary as well: “Finding the promising company is only the first
step. The next step is doing the research.” To his credit, Lynch insists
that no one should ever invest in a company, no matter how great its
products or how crowded its parking lot, without studying its financial
statements and estimating its business value.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most stock buyers have ignored that part.</p>
<p>Barbra Streisand, the day-trading diva, personified the way people
abuse Lynch’s teachings. In 1999 she burbled, “We go to Starbucks every
day, so I buy Starbucks stock.” But the Funny Girl forgot that no matter
how much you love those tall skinny lattes, you still have to analyze
Starbucks’s financial statements and make sure the stock isn’t even more
overpriced than the coffee. Countless stock buyers made the same mistake
by loading up on shares of Amazon.com because they loved the website or
buying e*Trade stock because it was their own online broker.</p>
<p>“Experts” gave the idea credence too. In an interview televised on
CNN in late 1999, portfolio manager Kevin Landis of the Firsthand Funds
was asked plaintively, “How do you do it? Why can’t I do it, Kevin?”
(From 1995 through the end of 1999, the Firsthand Technology Value fund
produced an astounding 58.2% average annualized gain.) “Well, you can do
it,” Landis chirped. “All you really need to do is focus on the things
that you know, and stay close to an industry, and talk to people who
work in it every day.”2</p>
<p>The most painful perversion of Lynch’s rule occurred in corporate
retirement plans. If you’re supposed to “buy what you know,” then what
could possibly be a better investment for your 401(k) than your own
company’s stock? After all, you work there; don’t you know more about
the company than an outsider ever could? Sadly, the employees of Enron,
Global Crossing, and WorldCom—many of whom put nearly all their
retirement assets in their own company’s stock, only to be wiped
out—learned that insiders often possess only the illusion of knowledge,
not the real thing.</p>
<p>Psychologists led by Baruch Fischhoff of Carnegie Mellon University
have documented a disturbing fact: becoming more familiar with a subject
does not significantly reduce people’s tendency to exaggerate how much
they actually know about it.3 That’s why “investing in what you know”
can be so dangerous; the more you know going in, the less likely you are
to probe a stock for weaknesses. This pernicious form of overconfidence
is called “home bias,” or the habit of sticking to what is already
familiar:</p>
<p>Individual investors own three times more shares in their local phone
company than in all other phone companies combined.</p>
<p>The typical mutual fund owns stocks whose headquarters are 115 miles
closer to the fund’s main office than the average U.S. company is.</p>
<p>401(k) investors keep between 25% and 30% of their retirement assets
in the stock of their own company.4</p>
<p>In short, familiarity breeds complacency. On the TV news, isn’t it
always the neighbor or the best friend or the parent of the criminal who
says in a shocked voice, “He was such a nice guy”? That’s because
whenever we are too close to someone or something, we take our beliefs
for granted, instead of questioning them as we do when we confront
something more remote. The more familiar a stock is, the more likely it
is to turn a defensive investor into a lazy one who thinks there’s no
need to do any homework. Don’t let that happen to you.</p>
<p>Can you Roll Your Own?</p>
<p>Fortunately, for a defensive investor who is willing to do the
required homework for assembling a stock portfolio, this is the Golden
Age: Never before in financial history has owning stocks been so cheap
and convenient.5</p>
<p>Do it yourself. Through specialized online brokerages like www.
sharebuilder.com, www.foliofn.com, and www.buyandhold.com, you can buy
stocks automatically even if you have very little cash to spare. These
websites charge as little as for each periodic purchase of any of the
thousands of U.S. stocks they make available. You can invest every week
or every month, reinvest the dividends, and even trickle your money into
stocks through electronic withdrawals from your bank account or direct
deposit from your paycheck. Sharebuilder charges more to sell than to
buy—reminding you, like a little whack across the nose with a rolled-up
newspaper, that rapid selling is an investing no-no—while FolioFN offers
an excellent tax-tracking tool.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional brokers or mutual funds that won’t let you in the
door for less than ,000 or ,000, these online firms have no minimum
account balances and are tailor-made for beginning investors who want to
put fledgling portfolios on autopilot. To be sure, a transaction fee of
takes a monstrous 8% bite out of a 0 monthly investment—but if that’s
all the money you can spare, then these microinvesting sites are the
only game in town for building a diversified portfolio.</p>
<p>You can also buy individual stocks straight from the issuing
companies. In 1994, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission loosened
the handcuffs it had long ago clamped onto the direct sale of stocks to
the public. Hundreds of companies responded by creating Internet-based
programs allowing investors to buy shares without going through a
broker. Some helpful online sources of information on buying stocks
directly include www.dripcentral.com, www.netstock direct.com (an
affiliate of Sharebuilder), and www.stockpower.com. You may often incur
a variety of nuisance fees that can exceed 5 per year. Even so,
direct-stock purchase programs are usually cheaper than
stockbrokers.</p>
<p>Be warned, however, that buying stocks in tiny increments for years
on end can set off big tax headaches. If you are not prepared to keep a
permanent and exhaustively detailed record of your purchases, do not buy
in the first place. Finally, don’t invest in only one stock—or even just
a handful of different stocks. Unless you are not willing to spread your
bets, you shouldn’t bet at all. Graham’s guideline of owning between 10
and 30 stocks remains a good starting point for investors who want to
pick their own stocks, but you must make sure that you are not
overexposed to one industry.6 (For more on how to pick the individual
stocks that will make up your portfolio, see pp. 114–115 and Chapters
11, 14, and 15.)</p>
<p>If, after you set up such an online autopilot portfolio, you find
yourself trading more than twice a year—or spending more than an hour or
two per month, total, on your investments—then something has gone badly
wrong. Do not let the ease and up-to-the-minute feel of the Internet
seduce you into becoming a speculator. A defensive investor runs—and
wins—the race by sitting still.</p>
<p>Get some help. A defensive investor can also own stocks through a
discount broker, a financial planner, or a full-service stockbroker. At
a discount brokerage, you’ll need to do most of the stock-picking work
yourself; Graham’s guidelines will help you create a core portfolio
requiring minimal maintenance and offering maximal odds of a steady
return. On the other hand, if you cannot spare the time or summon the
interest to do it yourself, there’s no reason to feel any shame in
hiring someone to pick stocks or mutual funds for you. But there’s one
responsibility that you must never delegate. You, and no one but you,
must investigate (before you hand over your money) whether an adviser is
trustworthy and charges reasonable fees. (For more pointers, see Chapter
10.)</p>
<p>Farm it out. Mutual funds are the ultimate way for a defensive
investor to capture the upside of stock ownership without the downside
of having to police your own portfolio. At relatively low cost, you can
buy a high degree of diversification and convenience—letting a
professional pick and watch the stocks for you. In their finest
form—index portfolios—mutual funds can require virtually no monitoring
or maintenance whatsoever. Index funds are a kind of Rip Van Winkle
investment that is highly unlikely to cause any suffering or surprises
even if, like Washington Irving’s lazy farmer, you fall asleep for 20
years. They are a defensive investor’s dream come true. For more detail,
see Chapter 9.</p>
<p>Filling in the Potholes</p>
<p>As the financial markets heave and crash their way up and down day
after day, the defensive investor can take control of the chaos. Your
very refusal to be active, your renunciation of any pretended ability to
predict the future, can become your most powerful weapons. By putting
every investment decision on autopilot, you drop any self-delusion that
you know where stocks are headed, and you take away the market’s power
to upset you no matter how bizarrely it bounces.</p>
<p>As Graham notes, “dollar-cost averaging” enables you to put a fixed
amount of money into an investment at regular intervals. Every week,
month, or calendar quarter, you buy more—whether the markets have gone
(or are about to go) up, down, or sideways. Any major mutual fund
company or brokerage firm can automatically and safely transfer the
money electronically for you, so you never have to write a check or feel
the conscious pang of payment. It’s all out of sight, out of mind.</p>
<p>The ideal way to dollar-cost average is into a portfolio of index
funds, which own every stock or bond worth having. That way, you
renounce not only the guessing game of where the market is going but
which sectors of the market—and which particular stocks or bonds within
them—will do the best.</p>
<p>Let’s say you can spare 00 a month. By owning and dollar-cost
averaging into just three index funds—00 into one that holds the total
U.S. stock market, 00 into one that holds foreign stocks, and 00 into
one that holds U.S. bonds—you can ensure that you own almost every
investment on the planet that’s worth owning.7 Every month, like
clockwork, you buy more. If the market has dropped, your preset amount
goes further, buying you more shares than the month before. If the
market has gone up, then your money buys you fewer shares. By putting
your portfolio on permanent autopilot this way, you prevent yourself
from either flinging money at the market just when it is seems most
alluring (and is actually most dangerous) or refusing to buy more after
a market crash has made investments truly cheaper (but seemingly more
“risky”).</p>
<p>According to Ibbotson Associates, the leading financial research
firm, if you had invested 2,000 in the Standard andandandand Poor’s
500-stock index at the beginning of September 1929, 10 years later you
would have had only ,223 left. But if you had started with a paltry 00
and simply invested another 00 every single month, then by August 1939,
your money would have grown to 5,571! That’s the power of disciplined
buying—even in the face of the Great Depression and the worst bear
market of all time.8</p>
<p>Figure 5-1 shows the magic of dollar-cost averaging in a more recent
bear market.</p>
<p>Best of all, once you build a permanent autopilot portfolio with
index funds as its heart and core, you’ll be able to answer every market
question with the most powerful response a defensive investor could ever
have: “I don’t know and I don’t care.” If someone asks whether bonds
will outper-forms stocks, just answer, “I don’t know and I don’t
care”—after all, you’re automatically buying both. Will health-care
stocks make high-tech stocks look sick? “I don’t know and I don’t
care”—you’re a permanent owner of both. What’s the next Microsoft? “I
don’t know and I don’t care”—as soon as it’s big enough to own, your
index fund will have it, and you’ll go along for the ride. Will foreign
stocks beat U.S. stocks next year? “I don’t know and I don’t care”—if
they do, you’ll capture that gain; if they don’t, you’ll get to buy more
at lower prices.</p>
<p>By enabling you to say “I don’t know and I don’t care,” a permanent
autopilot portfolio liberates you from the feeling that you need to
forecast what the financial markets are about to do—and the illusion
that anyone else can. The knowledge of how little you can know about the
future, coupled with the acceptance of your ignorance, is a defensive
investor’s most powerful weapon.</p>
<p>FIGURE 5-1</p>
<p>Every Little Bit Helps</p>
<p>From the end of 1999 through the end of 2002, the S andandandand P
500-stock average fell relentlessly. But if you had opened an index-fund
account with a ,000 minimum investment and added 00 every month, your
total outlay of ,600 would have lost 30.2%—considerably less than the
41.3% plunge in the market. Better yet, your steady buying at lower
prices would build the base for an explosive recovery when the market
rebounds.</p>
