<p>Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings</p>
<p>This chapter will begin with two pieces of advice to the investor
that cannot avoid being contradictory in their implications. The first
is: Don’t take a single year’s earnings seriously. The second is: If you
do pay attention to short-term earnings, look out for booby traps in the
per-share figures. If our first warning were followed strictly the
second would be unnecessary. But it is too much to expect that most
shareholders can relate all their common-stock decisions to the
long-term record and the long-term prospects. The quarterly figures, and
especially the annual figures, receive major attention in financial
circles, and this emphasis can hardly fail to have its impact on the
investor’s thinking. He may well need some education in this area, for
it abounds in misleading possibilities.</p>
<p>As this chapter is being written the earnings report of Aluminum
Company of America (ALCOA) for 1970 appears in the Wall Street Journal.
The first figures shown are</p>
<p>1970 1969</p>
<p>Share earningsa .20 .58</p>
<p>The little a at the outset is explained in a footnote to refer to
“primary earnings,” before special charges. There is much more footnote
material; in fact it occupies twice as much space as do the basic
figures themselves.</p>
<p>For the December quarter alone, the “earnings per share” are given as
.58 in 1970 against .56 in 1969.</p>
<p>The investor or speculator interested in ALCOA shares, reading those
figures, might say to himself: “Not so bad. I knew that 1970 was a
recession year in aluminum. But the fourth quarter shows a gain over
1969, with earnings at the rate of .32 per year. Let me see. The stock
is selling at 62. Why, that’s less than ten times earnings. That makes
it look pretty cheap, compared with 16 times for International Nickel,
etc., etc.”</p>
<p>But if our investor-speculator friend had bothered to read all the
material in the footnote, he would have found that instead of one figure
of earnings per share for the year 1970 there were actually four,
viz.:</p>
<p>1970 1969</p>
<p>Primary earnings .20 .58</p>
<p>Net income (after special charges) 4.32 5.58</p>
<p>Fully diluted, before special charges 5.01 5.35</p>
<p>Fully diluted, after special charges 4.19 5.35</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter alone only two figures are given:</p>
<p>Primary earnings .58 .56</p>
<p>Net income (after special charges) .70 1.56</p>
<p>What do all these additional earnings mean? Which earnings are true
earnings for the year and the December quarter? If the latter should be
taken at 70 cents—the net income after special charges—the annual rate
would be .80 instead of .32, and the price 62 would be “22 times
earnings,” instead of the 10 times we started with.</p>
<p>Part of the question as to the “true earnings” of ALCOA can be
answered quite easily. The reduction from .20 to .01, to allow for the
effects of “dilution,” is clearly called for. ALCOA has a large bond
issue convertible into common stock; to calculate the “earning power” of
the common, based on the 1970 results, it must be assumed that the
conversion privilege will be exercised if it should prove profitable to
the bondholders to do so. The amount involved in the ALCOA picture is
relatively small, and hardly deserves detailed comment. But in other
cases, making allowance for conversion rights—and the existence of
stock-purchase warrants—can reduce the apparent earnings by half, or
more. We shall present examples of a really significant dilution factor
below (page 411). (The financial services are not always consistent in
their allowance for the dilution factor in their reporting and
analyses.)*</p>
<p>Let us turn now to the matter of “special charges.” This figure of
8,800,000, or 88 cents per share, deducted in the fourth quarter, is not
unimportant. Is it to be ignored entirely, or fully recognized as an
earnings reduction, or partly recognized and partly ignored? The alert
investor might ask himself also how does it happen that there was a
virtual epidemic of such special charge-offs appearing after the close
of 1970, but not in previous years? Could there possibly have been some
fine Italian hands† at work with the accounting—but always, of course,
within the limits of the permissible? When we look closely we may find
that such losses, charged off before they actually occur, can be charmed
away, as it were, with no unhappy effect on either past or future
“primary earnings.” In some extreme cases they might be availed of to
make subsequent earnings appear nearly twice as large as in reality—by a
more or less prestidigitous treatment of the tax credit involved.</p>
<p>In dealing with ALCOA’s special charges, the first thing to establish
is how they arose. The footnotes are specific enough. The deductions
came from four sources, viz.:</p>
<p>Management’s estimate of the anticipated costs of closing down the
manufactured products division.</p>
<p>Ditto for closing down ALCOA Castings Co.’s plants.</p>
<p>Ditto for losses in phasing out ALCOA Credit Co.</p>
<p>Also, estimated costs of .3 million associated with completion of the
contract for a “curtain wall.”</p>
<p>All of these items are related to future costs and losses. It is easy
to say that they are not part of the “regular operating results” of
1970—but if so, where do they belong? Are they so “extraordinary and
nonrecurring” as to belong nowhere? A widespread enterprise such as
ALCOA, doing a .5 billion business annually, must have a lot of
divisions, departments, affiliates, and the like. Would it not be normal
rather than extraordinary for one or more to prove unprofitable, and to
require closing down? Similarly for such things as a contract to build a
wall. Suppose that any time a company had a loss on any part of its
business it had the bright idea of charging it off as a “special item,”
and thus reporting its “primary earnings” per share so as to include
only its profitable contracts and operations? Like King Edward VII’s
sundial, that marked only the “sunny hours.”*</p>
<p>The reader should note two ingenious aspects of the ALCOA procedure
we have been discussing. The first is that by anticipating future losses
the company escapes the necessity of allocating the losses themselves to
an identifiable year. They don’t belong in 1970, because they were not
actually taken in that year. And they won’t be shown in the year when
they are actually taken, because they have already been provided for.
Neat work, but might it not be just a little misleading?</p>
<p>The ALCOA footnote says nothing about the future tax saving from
these losses. (Most other statements of this sort state specifically
that only the “after-tax effect” has been charged off.) If the ALCOA
figure represents future losses before the related tax credit, then not
only will future earnings be freed from the weight of these charges (as
they are actually incurred), but they will be increased by a tax credit
of some 50% thereof. It is difficult to believe that the accounts will
be handled that way. But it is a fact that certain companies which have
had large losses in the past have been able to report future earnings
without charging the normal taxes against them, in that way making a
very fine profits appearance indeed—based paradoxically enough on their
past disgraces. (Tax credits resulting from past years’ losses are now
being shown separately as “special items,” but they will enter into
future statistics as part of the final “net-income” figure. However, a
reserve now set up for future losses, if net of expected tax credit,
should not create an addition of this sort to the net income of later
years.)</p>
<p>The other ingenious feature is the use by ALCOA and many other
companies of the 1970 year-end for making these special charge-offs. The
stock market took what appeared to be a blood bath in the first half of
1970. Everyone expected relatively poor results for the year for most
companies. Wall Street was now anticipating better results in 1971,
1972, etc. What a nice arrangement, then, to charge as much as possible
to the bad year, which had already been written off mentally and had
virtually receded into the past, leaving the way clear for nicely
fattened figures in the next few years! Perhaps this is good accounting,
good business policy, and good for management-shareholder relationships.
But we have lingering doubts.</p>
<p>The combination of widely (or should it be wildly?) diversified
operations with the impulse to clean house at the end of 1970 has
produced some strange-looking footnotes to the annual reports. The
reader may be amused by the following explanation given by a New York
Stock Exchange company (which shall remain unnamed) of its “special
items” aggregating ,357,000, or about a third of the income before
charge-offs: “Consists of provision for closing Spalding United Kingdom
operations; provision for reorganizational expenses of a division; costs
of selling a small babypants and bib manufacturing company, disposing of
part interest in a Spanish car-leasing facility, and liquidation of a
ski-boot operation.”*</p>
<p>Years ago the strong companies used to set up “contingency reserves”
out of the profits of good years to absorb some of the bad effects of
depression years to come. The underlying idea was to equalize the
reported earnings, more or less, and to improve the stability factor in
the company’s record. A worthy motive, it would seem; but the
accountants quite rightly objected to the practice as misstating the
true earnings. They insisted that each year’s results be presented as
they were, good or bad, and the shareholders and analysts be allowed to
do the averaging or equalizing for themselves. We seem now to be
witnessing the opposite phenomenon, with everyone charging off as much
as possible against forgotten 1970, so as to start 1971 with a slate not
only clean but specially prepared to show pleasing per-share figures in
the coming years.</p>
<p>It is time to return to our first question. What then were the true
earnings of ALCOA in 1970? The accurate answer would be: The .01 per
share, after “dilution,” less that part of the 82 cents of “special
charges” that may properly be attributed to occurrences in 1970. But we
do not know what that portion is, and hence we cannot properly state the
true earnings for the year. The management and the auditors should have
given us their best judgment on this point, but they did not do so. And
furthermore, the management and the auditors should have provided for
deduction of the balance of these charges from the ordinary earnings of
a suitable number of future years—say, not more than five. This
evidently they will not do either, since they have already conveniently
disposed of the entire sum as a 1970 special charge.</p>
<p>The more seriously investors take the per-share earnings figures as
published, the more necessary it is for them to be on their guard
against accounting factors of one kind and another that may impair the
true comparability of the numbers. We have mentioned three sorts of
these factors: the use of special charges, which may never be reflected
in the per-share earnings, the reduction in the normal income-tax
deduction by reason of past losses, and the dilution factor implicit in
the existence of substantial amounts of convertible securities or
warrants.1 A fourth item that has had a significant effect on reported
earnings in the past is the method of treating depreciation—chiefly as
between the “straight-line” and the “accelerated” schedules. We refrain
from details here. But as an example current as we write, let us mention
the 1970 report of Trane Co. This firm showed an increase of nearly 20%
in per-share earnings over 1969—.29 versus .76—but half of this came
from returning to the older straight-line depreciation rates, less
burdensome on earnings than the accelerated method used the year before.
(The company will continue to use the accelerated rate on its income-tax
return, thus deferring income-tax payments on the difference.) Still
another factor, important at times, is the choice between charging off
research and development costs in the year they are incurred or
amortizing them over a period of years. Finally, let us mention the
choice between the FIFO (first-in-first-out) and LIFO
(last-in-first-out) methods of valuing inventories.*</p>
<p>An obvious remark here would be that investors should not pay any
attention to these accounting variables if the amounts involved are
relatively small. But Wall Street being as it is, even items quite minor
in themselves can be taken seriously. Two days before the ALCOA report
appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the paper had quite a discussion of
the corresponding statement of Dow Chemical. It closed with the
observation that “many analysts” had been troubled by the fact that Dow
had included a 21-cent item in regular profits for 1969, instead of
treating it as an item of “extraordinary income.” Why the fuss? Because,
evidently, evaluations of Dow Chemical involving many millions of
dollars in the aggregate seemed to depend on exactly what was the
percentage gain for 1969 over 1968—in this case either 9% or 4½%. This
strikes us as rather absurd; it is very unlikely that small differences
involved in one year’s results could have any bearing on future average
profits or growth, and on a conservative, realistic valuation of the
enterprise.</p>
<p>By contrast, consider another statement also appearing in January
1971. This concerned Northwest Industries Inc.’s report for 1970.* The
company was planning to write off, as a special charge, not less than 64
million in one fell swoop. Of this, 00 million represents the loss to be
taken on the proposed sale of the railroad subsidiary to its employees
and the balance a write-down of a recent stock purchase. These sums
would work out to a loss of about 5 per share of common before dilution
offsets, or twice its then current market price. Here we have something
really significant. If the transaction goes through, and if the tax laws
are not changed, this loss provided for in 1970 will permit Northwest
Industries to realize about 00 million of future profits (within five
years) from its other diversified interests without paying income tax
thereon.* What will then be the real earnings of that enterprise; should
they be calculated with or without provision for the nearly 50% in
income taxes which it will not actually have to pay? In our opinion, the
proper mode of calculation would be first to consider the indicated
earning power on the basis of full income-tax liability, and to derive
some broad idea of the stock’s value based on that estimate. To this
should be added some bonus figure, representing the value per share of
the important but temporary tax exemption the company will enjoy.
(Allowance must be made, also, for a possible large-scale dilution in
this case. Actually, the convertible preferred issues and warrants would
more than double the outstanding common shares if the privileges are
exercised.)</p>
<p>All this may be confusing and wearisome to our readers, but it
belongs in our story. Corporate accounting is often tricky; security
analysis can be complicated; stock valuations are really dependable only
in exceptional cases.† For most investors it would be probably best to
assure themselves that they are getting good value for the prices they
pay, and let it go at that.</p>
<p>Use of Average Earnings</p>
<p>In former times analysts and investors paid considerable attention to
the average earnings over a fairly long period in the past—usually from
seven to ten years. This “mean figure”* was useful for ironing out the
frequent ups and downs of the business cycle, and it was thought to give
a better idea of the company’s earning power than the results of the
latest year alone. One important advantage of such an averaging process
is that it will solve the problem of what to do about nearly all the
special charges and credits. They should be included in the average
earnings. For certainly most of these losses and gains represent a part
of the company’s operating history. If we do this for ALCOA, the average
earnings for 1961–1970 (ten years) would appear as .62 and for the seven
years 1964–1970 as .62 per share. If such figures are used in
conjunction with ratings for growth and stability of earnings during the
same period, they could give a really informing picture of the company’s
past performance.</p>
<p>Calculation of the Past Growth Rate</p>
<p>It is of prime importance that the growth factor in a company’s
record be taken adequately into account. Where the growth has been large
the recent earnings will be well above the seven-or ten-year average,
and analysts may deem these long-term figures irrelevant. This need not
be the case. The earnings can be given in terms both of the average and
the latest figure. We suggest that the growth rate itself be calculated
by comparing the average of the last three years with corresponding
figures ten years earlier. (Where there is a problem of “special charges
or credits” it may be dealt with on some compromise basis.) Note the
following calculation for the growth of ALCOA as against that of Sears
Roebuck and the DJIA group as a whole.</p>
<p>Comment: These few figures could be made the subject of a long
discussion. They probably show as well as any others, derived by
elaborate mathematical treatment, the actual growth of earnings for the
long period 1958–1970. But how relevant is this figure, generally
considered central in common-stock valuations, to the case of ALCOA? Its
past growth rate was excellent, actually a bit better than that of
acclaimed Sears Roebuck and much higher than that of the DJIA composite.
But the market price at the beginning of 1971 seemed to pay no attention
to this fine performance. ALCOA sold at only 11½ times the recent
three-year average, while Sears sold at 27 times and the DJIA itself at
15+ times. How did this come about? Evidently Wall Street has fairly
pessimistic views about the future course of ALCOA’s earnings, in
contrast with its past record. Surprisingly enough, the high price for
ALCOA was made as far back as 1959. In that year it sold at 116, or 45
times its earnings. (This compares with a 1959 adjusted high price of
25½ for Sears Roebuck, or 20 times its then earnings.) Even though
ALCOA’s profits did show excellent growth thereafter, it is evident that
in this case the future possibilities were greatly overestimated in the
market price. It closed 1970 at exactly half of the 1959 high, while
Sears tripled in price and the DJIA moved up nearly 30%.</p>
<p>TABLE 12-1</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that ALCOA’s earnings on capital funds* had
been only average or less, and this may be the decisive factor here.
High multipliers have been maintained in the stock market only if the
company has maintained better than average profitability.</p>
<p>Let us apply at this point to ALCOA the suggestion we made in the
previous chapter for a “two-part appraisal process.”* Such an approach
might have produced a “past-performance value” for ALCOA of 10% of the
DJIA, or 4 per share relative to the closing price of 840 for the DJIA
in 1970. On this basis the shares would have appeared quite attractive
at their price of 57¼.</p>
<p>To what extent should the senior analyst have marked down the
“past-performance value” to allow for adverse developments that he saw
in the future? Frankly, we have no idea. Assume he had reason to believe
that the 1971 earnings would be as low as .50 per share—a large drop
from the 1970 figure, as against an advance expected for the DJIA. Very
likely the stock market would take this poor performance quite
seriously, but would it really establish the once mighty Aluminum
Company of America as a relatively unprofitable enterprise, to be valued
at less than its tangible assets behind the shares?† (In 1971 the price
declined from a high of 70 in May to a low of 36 in December, against a
book value of 55.)</p>
<p>ALCOA is surely a representative industrial company of huge size, but
we think that its price-and-earnings history is more unusual, even
contradictory, than that of most other large enterprises. Yet this
instance supports to some degree, the doubts we expressed in the last
chapter as to the dependability of the appraisal procedure when applied
to the typical industrial company.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 12</p>
<p>You can get ripped off easier by a dude with a pen than you can by a
dude with a gun.</p>
<p>—Bo Diddley</p>
<p>The Numbers Game</p>
<p>Even Graham would have been startled by the extent to which companies
and their accountants pushed the limits of propriety in the past few
years. Compensated heavily through stock options, top executives
realized that they could become fabulously rich merely by increasing
their company’s earnings for just a few years running.1 Hundreds of
companies violated the spirit, if not the letter, of accounting
principles—turning their financial reports into gibberish, tarting up
ugly results with cosmetic fixes, cloaking expenses, or manufacturing
earnings out of thin air. Let’s look at some of these unsavory
practices.</p>
<p>As If!</p>
<p>Perhaps the most widespread bit of accounting hocus-pocus was the
“pro forma” earnings fad. There’s an old saying on Wall Street that
every bad idea starts out as a good idea, and pro forma earnings
presentation is no different. The original point was to provide a truer
picture of the long-term growth of earnings by adjusting for short-term
deviations from the trend or for supposedly “nonrecurring” events. A pro
forma press release might, for instance, show what a company would have
earned over the past year if another firm it just acquired had been part
of the family for the entire 12 months.</p>
<p>But, as the Naughty 1990s advanced, companies just couldn’t leave
well enough alone. Just look at these examples of pro forma
flim-flam:</p>
<p>For the quarter ended September 30, 1999, InfoSpace, Inc. presented
its pro forma earnings as if it had not paid 59.9 million in
preferred-stock dividends.</p>
<p>For the quarter ended October 31, 2001, BEA Systems, Inc. presented
its pro forma earnings as if it had not paid 93 million in payroll taxes
on stock options exercised by its employees.</p>
<p>For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, JDS Uniphase Corp. presented
its pro forma earnings as if it had not paid million in payroll taxes,
had not lost million investing in lousy stocks, and had not incurred .5
billion in charges related to mergers and goodwill.</p>
<p>In short, pro forma earnings enable companies to show how well they
might have done if they hadn’t done as badly as they did.2 As an
intelligent investor, the only thing you should do with pro forma
earnings is ignore them.</p>
<p>Hungry for Recognition</p>
<p>In 2000, Qwest Communications International Inc., the
telecommunications giant, looked strong. Its shares dropped less than 5%
even as the stock market lost more than 9% that year.</p>
<p>But Qwest’s financial reports held an odd little revelation. In late
1999, Qwest decided to recognize the revenues from its telephone
directories as soon as the phone books were published—even though, as
anyone who has ever taken out a Yellow Pages advertisement knows, many
businesses pay for those ads in monthly installments. Abracadabra! That
piddly-sounding “change in accounting principle” pumped up 1999 net
income by 40 million after taxes—a fifth of all the money Qwest earned
that year.</p>
<p>Like a little chunk of ice crowning a submerged iceberg, aggressive
revenue recognition is often a sign of dangers that run deep and loom
large—and so it was at Qwest. By early 2003, after reviewing its
previous financial statements, the company announced that it had
prematurely recognized profits on equipment sales, improperly recorded
the costs of services provided by outsiders, inappropriately booked
costs as if they were capital assets rather than expenses, and
unjustifiably treated the exchange of assets as if they were outright
sales. All told, Qwest’s revenues for 2000 and 2001 had been overstated
by .2 billion—including 0 million from the earlier “change in accounting
principle,” which was now reversed.3</p>
<p>Capital Offenses</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, Global Crossing Ltd. had unlimited ambitions. The
Bermuda-based company was building what it called the “first integrated
global fiber optic network” over more than 100,000 miles of cables,
largely laid across the floor of the world’s oceans. After wiring the
world, Global Crossing would sell other communications companies the
right to carry their traffic over its network of cables. In 1998 alone,
Global Crossing spent more than 00 million to construct its optical web.
That year, nearly a third of the construction budget was charged against
revenues as an expense called “cost of capacity sold.” If not for that
78 million expense, Global Crossing—which reported a net loss of 6
million—could have reported a net profit of roughly 2 million.</p>
<p>The next year, says a bland footnote in the 1999 annual report,
Global Crossing “initiated service contract accounting.” The company
would no longer charge most construction costs as expenses against the
immediate revenues it received from selling capacity on its network.
Instead, a major chunk of those construction costs would now be treated
not as an operating expense but as a capital expenditure—thereby
increasing the company’s total assets, instead of decreasing its net
income.4</p>
<p>Poof! In one wave of the wand, Global Crossing’s “property and
equipment” assets rose by 75 million, while its cost of sales increased
by a mere 50 million—even though the company was spending money like a
drunken sailor.</p>
<p>Capital expenditures are an essential tool for managers to make a
good business grow bigger and better. But malleable accounting rules
permit managers to inflate reported profits by transforming normal
operating expenses into capital assets. As the Global Crossing case
shows, the intelligent investor should be sure to understand what, and
why, a company capitalizes.</p>
<p>An Inventory Story</p>
<p>Like many makers of semiconductor chips, Micron Technology,
Inc. suffered a drop in sales after 2000. In fact, Micron was hit so
hard by the plunge in demand that it had to start writing down the value
of its inventories—since customers clearly did not want them at the
prices Micron had been asking. In the quarter ended May 2001, Micron
slashed the recorded value of its inventories by 61 million. Most
investors interpreted the write-down not as a normal or recurring cost
of operations, but as an unusual event.</p>
<p>But look what happened after that:</p>
<p>FIGURE 12-1</p>
<p>A Block of the Old Chips</p>
<p>Source: Micron Technology’s financial reports.</p>
<p>Micron booked further inventory write-downs in every one of the next
six fiscal quarters. Was the devaluation of Micron’s inventory a
nonrecurring event, or had it become a chronic condition? Reasonable
minds can differ on this particular case, but one thing is clear: The
intelligent investor must always be on guard for “nonrecurring” costs
that, like the Energizer bunny, just keep on going.5</p>
<p>The Pension Dimension</p>
<p>In 2001, SBC Communications, Inc., which owns interests in Cingular
Wireless, PacTel, and Southern New England Telephone, earned .2 billion
in net income—a stellar performance in a bad year for the overextended
telecom industry. But that gain didn’t come only from SBC’s business.
Fully .4 billion of it—13% of the company’s net income—came from SBC’s
pension plan.</p>
<p>Because SBC had more money in the pension plan than it estimated was
necessary to pay its employees’ future benefits, the company got to
treat the difference as current income. One simple reason for that
surplus: In 2001, SBC raised the rate of return it expected to earn on
the pension plan’s investments from 8.5% to 9.5%—lowering the amount of
money it needed to set aside today.</p>
<p>SBC explained its rosy new expectations by noting that “for each of
the three years ended 2001, our actual 10-year return on investments
exceeded 10%.” In other words, our past returns have been high, so let’s
assume that our future returns will be too. But that not only flunked
the most rudimentary tests of logic, it flew in the face of the fact
that interest rates were falling to near-record lows, depressing the
future returns on the bond portion of a pension portfolio.</p>
<p>The same year, in fact, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway lowered
the expected rate of return on its pension assets from 8.3% to 6.5%. Was
SBC being realistic in assuming that its pension-fund managers could
significantly outperform the world’s greatest investor? Probably not: In
2001, Berkshire Hathaway’s pension fund gained 9.8%, but SBC’s pension
fund lost 6.9%.6</p>
<p>Here are some quick considerations for the intelligent investor: Is
the “net pension benefit” more than 5% of the company’s net income? (If
so, would you still be comfortable with the company’s other earnings if
those pension gains went away in future years?) Is the assumed
“long-term rate of return on plan assets” reasonable? (As of 2003,
anything above 6.5% is implausible, while a rising rate is downright
delusional.)</p>
<p>Caveat Investor</p>
<p>A few pointers will help you avoid buying a stock that turns out to
be an accounting time bomb:</p>
<p>Read backwards. When you research a company’s financial reports,
start reading on the last page and slowly work your way toward the
front. Anything that the company doesn’t want you to find is buried in
the back—which is precisely why you should look there first.</p>
<p>Read the notes.Never buy a stock without reading the footnotes to the
financial statements in the annual report. Usually labeled “summary of
significant accounting policies,” one key note describes how the company
recognizes revenue, records inventories, treats installment or contract
sales, expenses its marketing costs, and accounts for the other major
aspects of its business.7 In the other footnotes, watch for disclosures
about debt, stock options, loans to customers, reserves against losses,
and other “risk factors” that can take a big chomp out of earnings.
Among the things that should make your antennae twitch are technical
terms like “capitalized,” “deferred,” and “restructuring”—and
plain-English words signaling that the company has altered its
accounting practices, like “began,” “change,” and “however.” None of
those words mean you should not buy the stock, but all mean that you
need to investigate further. Be sure to compare the footnotes with those
in the financial statements of at least one firm that’s a close
competitor, to see how aggressive your company’s accountants are.</p>
<p>Read more. If you are an enterprising investor willing to put plenty
of time and energy into your portfolio, then you owe it to yourself to
learn more about financial reporting. That’s the only way to minimize
your odds of being misled by a shifty earnings statement. Three solid
books full of timely and specific examples are Martin Fridson and
Fernando Alvarez’s Financial Statement Analysis, Charles Mulford and
Eugene Comiskey’s The Financial Numbers Game, and Howard Schilit’s
Financial Shenanigans. 8</p>
