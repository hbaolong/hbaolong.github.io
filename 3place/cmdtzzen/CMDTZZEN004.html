<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>A Century of Stock-Market History: The Level of Stock Prices in Early
1972</p>
<p>The investor’s portfolio of common stocks will represent a small
cross-section of that immense and formidable institution known as the
stock market. Prudence suggests that he have an adequate idea of
stock-market history, in terms particularly of the major fluctuations in
its price level and of the varying relationships between stock prices as
a whole and their earnings and dividends. With this background he may be
in a position to form some worthwhile judgment of the attractiveness or
dangers of the level of the market as it presents itself at different
times. By a coincidence, useful statistical data on prices, earnings,
and dividends go back just 100 years, to 1871. (The material is not
nearly as full or dependable in the first half-period as in the second,
but it will serve.) In this chapter we shall present the figures, in
highly condensed form, with two objects in view. The first is to show
the general manner in which stocks have made their underlying advance
through the many cycles of the past century. The second is to view the
picture in terms of successive ten-year averages, not only of stock
prices but of earnings and dividends as well, to bring out the varying
relationship between the three important factors. With this wealth of
material as a background we shall pass to a consideration of the level
of stock prices at the beginning of 1972.</p>
<p>The long-term history of the stock market is summarized in two tables
and a chart. Table 3-1 sets forth the low and high points of nineteen
bear- and bull-market cycles in the past 100 years. We have used two
indexes here. The first represents a combination of an early study by
the Cowles Commission going back to 1870, which has been spliced on to
and continued to date in the well-known Standard andandandand Poor’s
composite index of 500 stocks. The second is the even more celebrated
Dow Jones Industrial Average (the DJIA, or “the Dow”), which dates back
to 1897; it contains 30 companies, of which one is American Telephone
andandandand Telegraph and the other 29 are large industrial
enterprises.1</p>
<p>TABLE 3-1 Major Stock-Market Swings Between 1871 and 1971</p>
<p>Chart I, presented by courtesy of Standard andandandand Poor’s,
depicts the market fluctuations of its 425-industrial-stock index from
1900 through 1970. (A corresponding chart available for the DJIA will
look very much the same.) The reader will note three quite distinct
patterns, each covering about a third of the 70 years. The first runs
from 1900 to 1924, and shows for the most part a series of rather
similar market cycles lasting from three to five years. The annual
advance in this period averaged just about 3%. We move on to the “New
Era” bull market, culminating in 1929, with its terrible aftermath of
collapse, followed by quite irregular fluctuations until 1949. Comparing
the average level of 1949 with that of 1924, we find the annual rate of
advance to be a mere 1½%; hence the close of our second period found the
public with no enthusiasm at all for common stocks. By the rule of
opposites the time was ripe for the beginning of the greatest bull
market in our history, presented in the last third of our chart. This
phenomenon may have reached its culmination in December 1968 at 118 for
Standard andandandand Poor’s 425 industrials (and 108 for its 500-stock
composite). As Table 3-1 shows, there were fairly important setbacks
between 1949 and 1968 (especially in 1956–57 and 1961–62), but the
recoveries therefrom were so rapid that they had to be denominated (in
the long- accepted semantics) as recessions in a single bull market,
rather than as separate market cycles. Between the low level of 162 for
“the Dow” in mid-1949 and the high of 995 in early 1966, the advance had
been more than sixfold in 17 years—which is at the average compounded
rate of 11% per year, not counting dividends of, say, 3½% per annum.
(The advance for the Standard andandandand Poor’s composite index was
somewhat greater than that of the DJIA—actually from 14 to 96.)</p>
<p>These 14% and better returns were documented in 1963, and later, in a
much publicized study.* 2 It created a natural satisfaction on Wall
Street with such fine achievements, and a quite illogical and dangerous
conviction that equally marvelous results could be expected for common
stocks in the future. Few people seem to have been bothered by the
thought that the very extent of the rise might indicate that it had been
overdone. The subsequent decline from the 1968 high to the 1970 low was
36% for the Standard andandandand Poor’s composite (and 37% for the
DJIA), the largest since the 44% suffered in 1939–1942, which had
reflected the perils and uncertainties after Pearl Harbor. In the
dramatic manner so characteristic of Wall Street, the low level of May
1970 was followed by a massive and speedy recovery of both averages, and
the establishment of a new all-time high for the Standard andandandand
Poor’s industrials in early 1972. The annual rate of price advance
between 1949 and 1970 works out at about 9% for the S andandandand P
composite (or the industrial index), using the average figures for both
years. That rate of climb was, of course, much greater than for any
similar period before 1950. (But in the last decade the rate of advance
was much lower—5¼% for the S andandandand P composite index and only the
once familiar 3% for the DJIA.)</p>
<p>The record of price movements should be supplemented by corresponding
figures for earnings and dividends, in order to provide an overall view
of what has happened to our share economy over the ten decades. We
present a conspectus of this kind in our Table 3-2 (p. 71). It is a good
deal to expect from the reader that he study all these figures with
care, but for some we hope they will be interesting and instructive.</p>
<p>Let us comment on them as follows: The full decade figures smooth out
the year-to-year fluctuations and leave a general picture of persistent
growth. Only two of the nine decades after the first show a decrease in
earnings and average prices (in 1891–1900 and 1931–1940), and no decade
after 1900 shows a decrease in average dividends. But the rates of
growth in all three categories are quite variable. In general the
performance since World War II has been superior to that of earlier
decades, but the advance in the 1960s was less pronounced than that of
the 1950s. Today’s investor cannot tell from this record what percentage
gain in earnings dividends and prices he may expect in the next ten
years, but it does supply all the encouragement he needs for a
consistent policy of common-stock investment.</p>
<p>However, a point should be made here that is not disclosed in our
table. The year 1970 was marked by a definite deterioration in the
overall earnings posture of our corporations. The rate of profit on
invested capital fell to the lowest percentage since the World War
years. Equally striking is the fact that a considerable number of
companies reported net losses for the year; many became “financially
troubled,” and for the first time in three decades there were quite a
few important bankruptcy proceedings. These facts as much as any others
have prompted the statement made above* that the great boom era may have
come to an end in 1969–1970.</p>
<p>A striking feature of Table 3-2 is the change in the price/earnings
ratios since World War II.† In June 1949 the S andandandand P composite
index sold at only 6.3 times the applicable earnings of the past 12
months; in March 1961 the ratio was 22.9 times. Similarly, the dividend
yield on the S andandandand P index had fallen from over 7% in 1949 to
only 3.0% in 1961, a contrast heightened by the fact that interest rates
on high-grade bonds had meanwhile risen from 2.60% to 4.50%. This is
certainly the most remarkable turnabout in the public’s attitude in all
stock-market history.</p>
<p>To people of long experience and innate caution the passage from one
extreme to another carried a strong warning of trouble ahead. They could
not help thinking apprehensively of the 1926–1929 bull market and its
tragic aftermath. But these fears have not been confirmed by the event.
True, the closing price of the DJIA in 1970 was the same as it was 6½
years earlier, and the much heralded “Soaring Sixties” proved to be
mainly a march up a series of high hills and then down again. But
nothing has happened either to business or to stock prices that can
compare with the bear market and depression of 1929–1932.</p>
<p>The Stock-Market Level in Early 1972</p>
<p>With a century-long conspectus of stock, prices, earnings, and
dividends before our eyes, let us try to draw some conclusions about the
level of 900 for the DJIA and 100 for the S andandandand P composite
index in January 1972.</p>
<p>In each of our former editions we have discussed the level of the
stock market at the time of writing, and endeavored to answer the
question whether it was too high for conservative purchase. The reader
may find it informing to review the conclusions we reached on these
earlier occasions. This is not entirely an exercise in self-punishment.
It will supply a sort of connecting tissue that links the various stages
of the stock market in the past twenty years and also a taken-from-life
picture of the difficulties facing anyone who tries to reach an informed
and critical judgment of current market levels. Let us, first, reproduce
the summary of the 1948, 1953, and 1959 analyses that we gave in the
1965 edition:</p>
<p>In 1948 we applied conservative standards to the Dow Jones level of
180, and found no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that “it was not
too high in relation to underlying values.” When we approached this
problem in 1953 the average market level for that year had reached 275,
a gain of over 50% in five years. We asked ourselves the same
question—namely, “whether in our opinion the level of 275 for the Dow
Jones Industrials was or was not too high for sound investment.” In the
light of the subsequent spectacular advance, it may seem strange to have
to report that it was by no means easy for us to reach a definitive
conclusion as to the attractiveness of the 1953 level. We did say,
positively enough, that “from the standpoint of value indications—our
chief investment guide—the conclusion about 1953 stock prices must be
favorable.” But we were concerned about the fact that in 1953, the
averages had advanced for a longer period than in most bull markets of
the past, and that its absolute level was historically high. Setting
these factors against our favorable value judgment, we advised a
cautious or compromise policy. As it turned out, this was not a
particularly brilliant counsel. A good prophet would have foreseen that
the market level was due to advance an additional 100% in the next five
years. Perhaps we should add in self-defense that few if any of those
whose business was stock-market forecasting—as ours was not—had any
better inkling than we did of what lay ahead.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1959 we found the DJIA at an all-time high of
584. Our lengthy analysis made from all points of view may be summarized
in the following (from page 59 of the 1959 edition): “In sum, we feel
compelled to express the conclusion that the present level of stock
prices is a dangerous one. It may well be perilous because prices are
already far too high. But even if this is not the case the market’s
momentum is such as inevitably to carry it to unjustifiable heights.
Frankly, we cannot imagine a market of the future in which there will
never be any serious losses, and in which, every tyro will be guaranteed
a large profit on his stock purchases.”</p>
<p>The caution we expressed in 1959 was somewhat better justified by the
sequel than was our corresponding attitude in 1954. Yet it was far from
fully vindicated. The DJIA advanced to 685 in 1961; then fell a little
below our 584 level (to 566) later in the year; advanced again to 735 in
late 1961; and then declined in near panic to 536 in May 1962, showing a
loss of 27% within the brief period of six months. At the same time
there was a far more serious shrinkage in the most popular “growth
stocks”—as evidenced by the striking fall of the indisputable leader,
International Business Machines, from a high of 607 in December 1961 to
a low of 300 in June 1962.</p>
<p>This period saw a complete debacle in a host of newly launched common
stocks of small enterprises—the so-called hot issues—which had been
offered to the public at ridiculously high prices and then had been
further pushed up by needless speculation to levels little short of
insane. Many of these lost 90% and more of the quotations in just a few
months.</p>
<p>The collapse in the first half of 1962 was disconcerting, if not
disastrous, to many self-acknowledged speculators and perhaps to many
more imprudent people who called themselves “investors.” But the
turnabout that came later that year was equally unsuspected by the
financial community. The stock-market averages resumed their upward
course, producing the following sequence:</p>
<p>The recovery and new ascent of common-stock prices was indeed
remarkable and created a corresponding revision of Wall Street
sentiment. At the low level of June 1962 predictions had appeared
predominantly bearish, and after the partial recovery to the end of that
year they were mixed, leaning to the skeptical side. But at the outset
of 1964 the natural optimism of brokerage firms was again manifest;
nearly all the forecasts were on the bullish side, and they so continued
through the 1964 advance.</p>
<p>We then approached the task of appraising the November 1964 levels of
the stock market (892 for the DJIA). After discussing it learnedly from
numerous angles we reached three main conclusions. The first was that
“old standards (of valuation) appear inapplicable; new standards have
not yet been tested by time.” The second was that the investor “must
base his policy on the existence of major uncertainties. The
possibilities compass the extremes, on the one hand, of a protracted and
further advance in the market’s level—say by 50%, or to 1350 for the
DJIA; or, on the other hand, of a largely unheralded collapse of the
same magnitude, bringing the average in the neighborhood of, say, 450“
(p. 63). The third was expressed in much more definite terms. We said:
“Speaking bluntly, if the 1964 price level is not too high how could we
say that any price level is too high?” And the chapter closed as
follows:</p>
<p>WHAT COURSE TO FOLLOW</p>
<p>Investors should not conclude that the 1964 market level is dangerous
merely because they read it in this book. They must weigh our reasoning
against the contrary reasoning they will hear from most competent and
experienced people on Wall Street. In the end each one must make his own
decision and accept responsibility therefor. We suggest, however, that
if the investor is in doubt as to which course to pursue he should
choose the path of caution. The principles of investment, as set forth
herein, would call for the following policy under 1964 conditions, in
order of urgency:</p>
<p>No borrowing to buy or hold securities.</p>
<p>No increase in the proportion of funds held in common stocks.</p>
<p>A reduction in common-stock holdings where needed to bring it down to
a maximum of 50 per cent of the total portfolio. The capital-gains tax
must be paid with as good grace as possible, and the proceeds invested
in first-quality bonds or held as a savings deposit.</p>
<p>Investors who for some time have been following a bona fide
dollar-cost averaging plan can in logic elect either to continue their
periodic purchases unchanged or to suspend them until they feel the
market level is no longer dangerous. We should advise rather strongly
against the initiation of a new dollar-averaging plan at the late 1964
levels, since many investors would not have the stamina to pursue such a
scheme if the results soon after initiation should appear highly
unfavorable.</p>
<p>This time we can say that our caution was vindicated. The DJIA
advanced about 11% further, to 995, but then fell irregularly to a low
of 632 in 1970, and finished that year at 839. The same kind of debacle
took place in the price of “hot issues”—i.e., with declines running as
much as 90%—as had happened in the 1961–62 setback. And, as pointed out
in the Introduction, the whole financial picture appeared to have
changed in the direction of less enthusiasm and greater doubts. A single
fact may summarize the story: The DJIA closed 1970 at a level lower than
six years before—the first time such a thing had happened since
1944.</p>
<p>Such were our efforts to evaluate former stock-market levels. Is
there anything we and our readers can learn from them? We considered the
market level favorable for investment in 1948 and 1953 (but too
cautiously in the latter year), “dangerous” in 1959 (at 584 for DJIA),
and “too high” (at 892) in 1964. All of these judgments could be
defended even today by adroit arguments. But it is doubtful if they have
been as useful as our more pedestrian counsels—in favor of a consistent
and controlled common-stock policy on the one hand, and discouraging
endeavors to “beat the market” or to “pick the winners” on the
other.</p>
<p>Nonetheless we think our readers may derive some benefit from a
renewed consideration of the level of the stock market—this time as of
late 1971—even if what we have to say will prove more interesting than
practically useful, or more indicative than conclusive. There is a fine
passage near the beginning of Aristotle’s Ethics that goes: “It is the
mark of an educated mind to expect that amount of exactness which the
nature of the particular subject admits. It is equally unreasonable to
accept merely probable conclusions from a mathematician and to demand
strict demonstration from an orator.” The work of a financial analyst
falls somewhere in the middle between that of a mathematician and of an
orator.</p>
<p>At various times in 1971 the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at
the 892 level of November 1964 that we considered in our previous
edition. But in the present statistical study we have decided to use the
price level and the related data for the Standard andandandand Poor’s
composite index (or S andandandand P 500), because it is more
comprehensive and representative of the general market than the 30-stock
DJIA. We shall concentrate on a comparison of this material near the
four dates of our former editions—namely the year-ends of 1948, 1953,
1958 and 1963—plus 1968; for the current price level we shall take the
convenient figure of 100, which was registered at various times in 1971
and in early 1972. The salient data are set forth in Table 3-3. For our
earnings figures we present both the last year’s showing and the average
of three calendar years; for 1971 dividends we use the last twelve
months’ figures; and for 1971 bond interest and wholesale prices those
of August 1971.</p>
<p>The 3-year price/earnings ratio for the market was lower in October
1971 than at year-end 1963 and 1968. It was about the same as in 1958,
but much higher than in the early years of the long bull market. This
important indicator, taken by itself, could not be construed to indicate
that the market was especially high in January 1972. But when the
interest yield on high-grade bonds is brought into the picture, the
implications become much less favorable. The reader will note from our
table that the ratio of stock returns (earnings/price) to bond returns
has grown worse during the entire period, so that the January 1972
figure was less favorable to stocks, by this criterion, than in any of
the previous years examined. When dividend yields are compared with bond
yields we find that the relationship was completely reversed between
1948 and 1972. In the early year stocks yielded twice as much as bonds;
now bonds yield twice as much, and more, than stocks.</p>
<p>Our final judgment is that the adverse change in the
bond-yield/stock-yield ratio fully offsets the better price/earnings
ratio for late 1971, based on the 3-year earnings figures. Hence our
view of the early 1972 market level would tend to be the same as it was
some 7 years ago—i.e., that it is an unattractive one from the
standpoint of conservative investment. (This would apply to most of the
1971 price range of the DJIA: between, say, 800 and 950.)</p>
<p>In terms of historical market swings the 1971 picture would still
appear to be one of irregular recovery from the bad setback suffered in
1969–1970. In the past such recoveries have ushered in a new stage of
the recurrent and persistent bull market that began in 1949. (This was
the expectation of Wall Street generally during 1971.) After the
terrible experience suffered by the public buyers of low-grade
common-stock offerings in the 1968–1970 cycle, it is too early (in 1971)
for another twirl of the new-issue merry-go-round. Hence that dependable
sign of imminent danger in the market is lacking now, as it was at the
892 level of the DJIA in November 1964, considered in our previous
edition. Technically, then, the outlook would appear to favor another
substantial rise far beyond the 900 DJIA level before the next serious
setback or collapse. But we cannot quite leave the matter there, as
perhaps we should. To us, the early-1971-market’s disregard of the
harrowing experiences of less than a year before is a disquieting sign.
Can such heedlessness go unpunished? We think the investor must be
prepared for difficult times ahead—perhaps in the form of a fairly quick
replay of the the 1969–1970 decline, or perhaps in the form of another
bull-market fling, to be followed by a more catastrophic collapse.3</p>
<p>What Course to Follow</p>
<p>Turn back to what we said in the last edition, reproduced on p. 75.
This is our view at the same price level—say 900—for the DJIA in early
1972 as it was in late 1964.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 3</p>
<p>You’ve got to be careful if you don’t know where you’re going, ’cause
you might not get there.</p>
<p>—Yogi Berra</p>
<p>Bull-Market Baloney</p>
<p>In this chapter, Graham shows how prophetic he can be. He looks two
years ahead, foreseeing the “catastrophic” bear market of 1973–1974, in
which U.S. stocks lost 37% of their value.1 He also looks more than two
decades into the future, eviscerating the logic of market gurus and
best-selling books that were not even on the horizon in his
lifetime.</p>
<p>The heart of Graham’s argument is that the intelligent investor must
never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past.
Unfortunately, that’s exactly the mistake that one pundit after another
made in the 1990s. A stream of bullish books followed Wharton finance
professor Jeremy Siegel’s Stocks for the Long Run (1994)—culminating, in
a wild crescendo, with James Glassman and Kevin Hassett’s Dow 36,000,
David Elias’ Dow 40,000, and Charles Kadlec’s Dow 100,000 (all published
in 1999). Forecasters argued that stocks had returned an annual average
of 7% after inflation ever since 1802. Therefore, they concluded, that’s
what investors should expect in the future.</p>
<p>Some bulls went further. Since stocks had “always” beaten bonds over
any period of at least 30 years, stocks must be less risky than bonds or
even cash in the bank. And if you can eliminate all the risk of owning
stocks simply by hanging on to them long enough, then why quibble over
how much you pay for them in the first place? (To find out why, see the
sidebar on p. 82.)</p>
<p>In 1999 and early 2000, bull-market baloney was everywhere:</p>
<p>On December 7, 1999, Kevin Landis, portfolio manager of the Firsthand
mutual funds, appeared on CNN’s Moneyline telecast. Asked if wireless
telecommunication stocks were overvalued—with many trading at infinite
multiples of their earnings—Landis had a ready answer. “It’s not a
mania,” he shot back. “Look at the outright growth, the absolute value
of the growth. It’s big.”</p>
<p>On January 18, 2000, Robert Froelich, chief investment strategist at
the Kemper Funds, declared in the Wall Street Journal: “It’s a new world
order. We see people discard all the right companies with all the right
people with the right vision because their stock price is too
high—that’s the worst mistake an investor can make.”</p>
<p>In the April 10, 2000, issue of BusinessWeek, Jeffrey M. Applegate,
then the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, asked
rhetorically: “Is the stock market riskier today than two years ago
simply because prices are higher? The answer is no.”</p>
<p>But the answer is yes. It always has been. It always will be.</p>
<p>And when Graham asked, “Can such heedlessness go unpunished?” he knew
that the eternal answer to that question is no. Like an enraged Greek
god, the stock market crushed everyone who had come to believe that the
high returns of the late 1990s were some kind of divine right. Just look
at how those forecasts by Landis, Froelich, and Applegate held up:</p>
<p>From 2000 through 2002, the most stable of Landis’s pet wireless
stocks, Nokia, lost “only” 67%—while the worst, Winstar Communications,
lost 99.9%.</p>
<p>Froelich’s favorite stocks—Cisco Systems and Motorola—fell more than
70% by late 2002. Investors lost over 00 billion on Cisco alone—more
than the annual economic output of Hong Kong, Israel, Kuwait, and
Singapore combined.</p>
<p>In April 2000, when Applegate asked his rhetorical question, the Dow
Jones Industrials stood at 11,187; the NASDAQ Composite Index was at
4446. By the end of 2002, the Dow was hobbling around the 8,300 level,
while NASDAQ had withered to roughly 1300—eradicating all its gains over
the previous six years.</p>
<p>SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST</p>
<p>There was a fatal flaw in the argument that stocks have “always”
beaten bonds in the long run: Reliable figures before 1871 do not exist.
The indexes used to represent the U.S. stock market’s earliest returns
contain as few as seven (yes, 7!) stocks.1 By 1800, however, there were
some 300 companies in America (many in the Jeffersonian equivalents of
the Internet: wooden turnpikes and canals). Most went bankrupt, and
their investors lost their knickers.</p>
<p>But the stock indexes ignore all the companies that went bust in
those early years, a problem technically known as “survivorship bias.”
Thus these indexes wildly overstate the results earned by real-life
investors—who lacked the 20/20 hindsight necessary to know exactly which
seven stocks to buy. A lonely handful of companies, including Bank of
New York and J. P. Morgan Chase, have prospered continuously since the
1790s. But for every such miraculous survivor, there were thousands of
financial disasters like the Dismal Swamp Canal Co., the Pennsylvania
Cultivation of Vines Co., and the Snickers’s Gap Turn-pike Co.—all
omitted from the “historical” stock indexes.</p>
<p>Jeremy Siegel’s data show that, after inflation, from 1802 through
1870 stocks gained 7.0% per year, bonds 4.8%, and cash 5.1%. But Elroy
Dimson and his colleagues at London Business School estimate that the
pre-1871 stock returns are overstated by at least two percentage points
per year.2 In the real world, then, stocks did no better than cash and
bonds—and perhaps a bit worse. Anyone who claims that the long-term
record “proves” that stocks are guaranteed to outper-forms bonds or cash
is an ignoramus.</p>
<p>The Higher they Go, the Harder they Fall</p>
<p>As the enduring antidote to this kind of bull-market baloney, Graham
urges the intelligent investor to ask some simple, skeptical questions.
Why should the future returns of stocks always be the same as their past
returns? When every investor comes to believe that stocks are guaranteed
to make money in the long run, won’t the market end up being wildly
overpriced? And once that happens, how can future returns possibly be
high?</p>
<p>Graham’s answers, as always, are rooted in logic and common sense.
The value of any investment is, and always must be, a function of the
price you pay for it. By the late 1990s, inflation was withering away,
corporate profits appeared to be booming, and most of the world was at
peace. But that did not mean—nor could it ever mean—that stocks were
worth buying at any price. Since the profits that companies can earn are
finite, the price that investors should be willing to pay for stocks
must also be finite.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: Michael Jordan may well have been the greatest
basketball player of all time, and he pulled fans into Chicago Stadium
like a giant electromagnet. The Chicago Bulls got a bargain by paying
Jordan up to 4 million a year to bounce a big leather ball around a
wooden floor. But that does not mean the Bulls would have been justified
paying him 40 million, or .4 billion, or 4 billion, per season.</p>
<p>The Limits of Optimism</p>
<p>Focusing on the market’s recent returns when they have been rosy,
warns Graham, will lead to “a quite illogical and dangerous conclusion
that equally marvelous results could be expected for common stocks in
the future.” From 1995 through 1999, as the market rose by at least 20%
each year—a surge unprecedented in American history—stock buyers became
ever more optimistic:</p>
<p>In mid-1998, investors surveyed by the Gallup Organization for the
PaineWebber brokerage firm expected their portfolios to earn an average
of roughly 13% over the year to come. By early 2000, their average
expected return had jumped to more than 18%.</p>
<p>“Sophisticated professionals” were just as bullish, jacking up their
own assumptions of future returns. In 2001, for instance, SBC
Communications raised the projected return on its pension plan from 8.5%
to 9.5%. By 2002, the average assumed rate of return on the pension
plans of companies in the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index
had swollen to a record-high 9.2%.</p>
<p>A quick follow-up shows the awful aftermath of excess enthusiasm:</p>
<p>Gallup found in 2001 and 2002 that the average expectation of
one-year returns on stocks had slumped to 7%—even though investors could
now buy at prices nearly 50% lower than in 2000.2</p>
<p>Those gung-ho assumptions about the returns on their pension plans
will cost the companies in the S andandandand P 500 a bare minimum of 2
billion between 2002 and 2004, according to recent Wall Street
estimates.</p>
<p>Even though investors all know they’re supposed to buy low and sell
high, in practice they often end up getting it backwards. Graham’s
warning in this chapter is simple: “By the rule of opposites,” the more
enthusiastic investors become about the stock market in the long run,
the more certain they are to be proved wrong in the short run. On March
24, 2000, the total value of the U.S. stock market peaked at 4.75
trillion. By October 9, 2002, just 30 months later, the total U.S. stock
market was worth .34 trillion, or 50.2% less—a loss of .41 trillion.
Meanwhile, many market pundits turned sourly bearish, predicting flat or
even negative market returns for years—even decades—to come.</p>
<p>At this point, Graham would ask one simple question: Considering how
calamitously wrong the “experts” were the last time they agreed on
something, why on earth should the intelligent investor believe them
now?</p>
<p>What’s Next?</p>
<p>Instead, let’s tune out the noise and think about future returns as
Graham might. The stock market’s performance depends on three
factors:</p>
<p>real growth (the rise of companies’ earnings and dividends)</p>
<p>inflationary growth (the general rise of prices throughout the
economy)</p>
<p>speculative growth—or decline (any increase or decrease in the
investing public’s appetite for stocks)</p>
<p>In the long run, the yearly growth in corporate earnings per share
has averaged 1.5% to 2% (not counting inflation).3 As of early 2003,
inflation was running around 2.4% annually; the dividend yield on stocks
was 1.9%. So,</p>
<p>In the long run, that means you can reasonably expect stocks to
average roughly a 6% return (or 4% after inflation). If the investing
public gets greedy again and sends stocks back into orbit, then that
speculative fever will temporarily drive returns higher. If, instead,
investors are full of fear, as they were in the 1930s and 1970s, the
returns on stocks will go temporarily lower. (That’s where we are in
2003.)</p>
<p>Robert Shiller, a finance professor at Yale University, says Graham
inspired his valuation approach: Shiller compares the current price of
the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index against average
corporate profits over the past 10 years (after inflation). By scanning
the historical record, Shiller has shown that when his ratio goes well
above 20, the market usually delivers poor returns afterward; when it
drops well below 10, stocks typically produce handsome gains down the
road. In early 2003, by Shiller’s math, stocks were priced at about 22.8
times the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the past decade—still
in the danger zone, but way down from their demented level of 44.2 times
earnings in December 1999.</p>
<p>How has the market done in the past when it was priced around today’s
levels? Figure 3-1 shows the previous periods when stocks were at
similar highs, and how they fared over the 10-year stretches that
followed:</p>
<p>FIGURE 3-1</p>
<p>Sources: http://aida.econ.yale.edu/˜shiller/data/ie_data.htm; Jack
Wilson and Charles Jones, “An Analysis of the S andandandand P 500 Index
and Cowles’ Extensions: Price Index and Stock Returns, 1870–1999,” The
Journal of Business, vol. 75, no. 3, July, 2002, pp. 527–529; Ibbotson
Associates.</p>
<p>Notes: Price/earnings ratio is Shiller calculation (10-year average
real earnings of S andandandand P 500-stock index divided by December 31
index value). Total return is nominal annual average.</p>
<p>So, from valuation levels similar to those of early 2003, the stock
market has sometimes done very well in the ensuing 10 years, sometimes
poorly, and muddled along the rest of the time. I think Graham, ever the
conservative, would split the difference between the lowest and highest
past returns and project that over the next decade stocks will earn
roughly 6% annually, or 4% after inflation. (Interestingly, that
projection matches the estimate we got earlier when we added together
real growth, inflationary growth, and speculative growth.) Compared to
the 1990s, 6% is chicken feed. But it’s a whisker better than the gains
that bonds are likely to produce—and reason enough for most investors to
hang on to stocks as part of a diversified portfolio.</p>
<p>But there is a second lesson in Graham’s approach. The only thing you
can be confident of while forecasting future stock returns is that you
will probably turn out to be wrong. The only indisputable truth that the
past teaches us is that the future will always surprise us—always! And
the corollary to that law of financial history is that the markets will
most brutally surprise the very people who are most certain that their
views about the future are right. Staying humble about your forecasting
powers, as Graham did, will keep you from risking too much on a view of
the future that may well turn out to be wrong.</p>
<p>So, by all means, you should lower your expectations—but take care
not to depress your spirit. For the intelligent investor, hope always
springs eternal, because it should. In the financial markets, the worse
the future looks, the better it usually turns out to be. A cynic once
told G. K. Chesterton, the British novelist and essayist, “Blessed is he
who expecteth nothing, for he shall not be disappointed.” Chesterton’s
rejoinder? “Blessed is he who expecteth nothing, for he shall enjoy
everything.”</p>
