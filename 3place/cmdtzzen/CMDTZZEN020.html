<p>Shareholders and Managements: Dividend Policy</p>
<p>Ever since 1934 we have argued in our writings for a more intelligent
and energetic attitude by shareholders toward their managements. We have
asked them to take a generous attitude toward those who are demonstrably
doing a good job. We have asked them also to demand clear and satisfying
explanations when the results appear to be worse than they should be,
and to support movements to improve or remove clearly unproductive
managements. Shareholders are justified in raising questions as to the
competence of the management when the results (1) are unsatisfactory in
themselves, (2) are poorer than those obtained by other companies that
appear similarly situated, and (3) have resulted in an unsatisfactory
market price of long duration.</p>
<p>In the last 36 years practically nothing has actually been
accomplished through intelligent action by the great body of
shareholders. A sensible crusader—if there are any such—would take this
as a sign that he has been wasting his time, and that he had better give
up the fight. As it happens our cause has not been lost; it has been
rescued by an extraneous development—known as takeovers, or take-over
bids.* We said in Chapter 8 that poor managements produce poor market
prices. The low market prices, in turn, attract the attention of
companies interested in diversifying their operations—and these are now
legion. Innumerable such acquisitions have been accomplished by
agreement with the existing managements, or else by accumulation of
shares in the market and by offers made over the head of those in
control. The price bid has usually been within the range of the value of
the enterprise under reasonably competent management. Hence, in many
cases, the inert public shareholder has been bailed out by the actions
of “outsiders”—who at times may be enterprising individuals or groups
acting on their own.</p>
<p>It can be stated as a rule with very few exceptions that poor
managements are not changed by action of the “public stockholders,” but
only by the assertion of control by an individual or compact group. This
is happening often enough these days to put the management, including
the board of directors, of a typical publicly controlled company on
notice that if its operating results and the resulting market price are
highly unsatisfactory, it may become the target of a successful
take-over move. As a consequence, boards of directors have probably
become more alive than previously to their fundamental duty to see that
their company has a satisfactory top management. Many more changes of
presidents have been seen in recent years than formerly.</p>
<p>Not all companies in the unsatisfactory class have benefited from
such developments. Also, the change has often occurred after a long
period of bad results without remedial action, and has depended on
enough disappointed shareholders selling out at low prices to permit the
energetic outsiders to acquire a controlling position in the shares. But
the idea that public shareholders could really help themselves by
supporting moves for improving management and management policies has
proved too quixotic to warrant further space in this book. Those
individual shareholders who have enough gumption to make their presence
felt at annual meetings—generally a completely futile performance—will
not need our counsel on what points to raise with the managements. For
others the advice would probably be wasted. Nevertheless, let us close
this section with the plea that shareholders consider with an open mind
and with careful attention any proxy material sent them by
fellow-shareholders who want to remedy an obviously unsatisfactory
management situation in the company.</p>
<p>Shareholders and Dividend Policy</p>
<p>In the past the dividend policy was a fairly frequent subject of
argument between public, or “minority,” shareholders and managements. In
general these shareholders wanted more liberal dividends, while the
managements preferred to keep the earnings in the business “to
strengthen the company.” They asked the shareholders to sacrifice their
present interests for the good of the enterprise and for their own
future long-term benefit. But in recent years the attitude of investors
toward dividends has been undergoing a gradual but significant change.
The basic argument now for paying small rather than liberal dividends is
not that the company “needs” the money, but rather that it can use it to
the shareholders’ direct and immediate advantage by retaining the funds
for profitable expansion. Years ago it was typically the weak company
that was more or less forced to hold on to its profits, instead of
paying out the usual 60% to 75% of them in dividends. The effect was
almost always adverse to the market price of the shares. Nowadays it is
quite likely to be a strong and growing enterprise that deliberately
keeps down its dividend payments, with the approval of investors and
speculators alike.*</p>
<p>There was always a strong theoretical case for reinvesting profits in
the business where such retention could be counted on to produce a
goodly increase in earnings. But there were several strong
counter-arguments, such as: The profits “belong” to the shareholders,
and they are entitled to have them paid out within the limits of prudent
management; many of the shareholders need their dividend income to live
on; the earnings they receive in dividends are “real money,” while those
retained in the company may or may not show up later as tangible values
for the shareholders. These counter-arguments were so compelling, in
fact, that the stock market showed a persistent bias in favor of the
liberal dividend payers as against the companies that paid no dividends
or relatively small ones.1</p>
<p>In the last 20 years the “profitable reinvestment” theory has been
gaining ground. The better the past record of growth, the readier
investors and speculators have become to accept a lowpay-out policy. So
much is this true that in many cases of growth favorites the dividend
rate—or even the absence of any dividend—has seemed to have virtually no
effect on the market price.*</p>
<p>A striking example of this development is found in the history of
Texas Instruments, Incorporated. The price of its common stock rose from
5 in 1953 to 256 in 1960, while earnings were advancing from 43 cents to
.91 per share and while no dividend of any kind was paid. (In 1962 cash
dividends were initiated, but by that year the earnings had fallen to
.14 and the price had shown a spectacular drop to a low of 49.)</p>
<p>Another extreme illustration is provided by Superior Oil. In 1948 the
company reported earnings of 5.26 per share, paid in dividends, and sold
as high as 235. In 1953 the dividend was reduced to , but the high price
was 660. In 1957 it paid no dividend at all, and sold at 2,000! This
unusual issue later declined to 795 in 1962, when it earned 9.50 and
paid .50.*</p>
<p>Investment sentiment is far from crystallized in this matter of
dividend policy of growth companies. The conflicting views are well
illustrated by the cases of two of our very largest
corporations—American Telephone andandandand Telegraph and International
Business Machines. American Tel. andandandand Tel. came to be regarded
as an issue with good growth possibilities, as shown by the fact that in
1961 it sold at 25 times that year’s earnings. Nevertheless, the
company’s cash dividend policy has remained an investment and
speculative consideration of first importance, its quotation making an
active response to even rumors of an impending increase in the dividend
rate. On the other hand, comparatively little attention appears to have
been paid to the cash dividend on IBM, which in 1960 yielded only 0.5%
at the high price of the year and 1.5% at the close of 1970. (But in
both cases stock splits have operated as a potent stock-market
influence.)</p>
<p>The market’s appraisal of cash-dividend policy appears to be
developing in the following direction: Where prime emphasis is not
placed on growth the stock is rated as an “income issue,” and the
dividend rate retains its long-held importance as the prime determinant
of market price. At the other extreme, stocks clearly recognized to be
in the rapid-growth category are valued primarily in terms of the
expected growth rate over, say, the next decade, and the cash-dividend
rate is more or less left out of the reckoning.</p>
<p>While the above statement may properly describe present tendencies,
it is by no means a clear-cut guide to the situation in all common
stocks, and perhaps not in the majority of them. For one thing, many
companies occupy an intermediate position between growth and nongrowth
enterprises. It is hard to say how much importance should be ascribed to
the growth factor in such cases, and the market’s view thereof may
change radically from year to year. Secondly, there seems to be
something paradoxical about requiring the companies showing slower
growth to be more liberal with their cash dividends. For these are
generally the less prosperous concerns, and in the past the more
prosperous the company the greater was the expectation of both liberal
and increasing payments.</p>
<p>It is our belief that shareholders should demand of their managements
either a normal payout of earnings—on the order, say, of two-thirds—or
else a clear-cut demonstration that the reinvested profits have produced
a satisfactory increase in per-share earnings. Such a demonstration
could ordinarily be made in the case of a recognized growth company. But
in many other cases a low payout is clearly the cause of an average
market price that is below fair value, and here the shareholders have
every right to inquire and probably to complain.</p>
<p>A niggardly policy has often been imposed on a company because its
financial position is relatively weak, and it has needed all or most of
its earnings (plus depreciation charges) to pay debts and bolster its
working-capital position. When this is so there is not much the
shareholders can say about it—except perhaps to criticize the management
for permitting the company to fall into such an unsatisfactory financial
position. However, dividends are sometimes held down by relatively
unprosperous companies for the declared purpose of expanding the
business. We feel that such a policy is illogical on its face, and
should require both a complete explanation and a convincing defense
before the shareholders should accept it. In terms of the past record
there is no reason a priori to believe that the owners will benefit from
expansion moves undertaken with their money by a business showing
mediocre results and continuing its old management.</p>
<p>Stock Dividends and Stock Splits</p>
<p>It is important that investors understand the essential difference
between a stock dividend (properly so-called) and a stock split. The
latter represents a restatement of the common-stock structure—in a
typical case by issuing two or three shares for one. The new shares are
not related to specific earnings reinvested in a specific past period.
Its purpose is to establish a lower market price for the single shares,
presumably because such lower price range would be more acceptable to
old and new shareholders. A stock split may be carried out by what
technically may be called a stock dividend, which involves a transfer of
sums from earned surplus to capital account; or else by a change in par
value, which does not affect the surplus account.*</p>
<p>What we should call a proper stock dividend is one that is paid to
shareholders to give them a tangible evidence or representation of
specific earnings which have been reinvested in the business for their
account over some relatively short period in the recent past—say, not
more than the two preceding years. It is now approved practice to value
such a stock dividend at the approximate value at the time of
declaration, and to transfer an amount equal to such value from earned
surplus to capital accounts. Thus the amount of a typical stock dividend
is relatively small—in most cases not more than 5%. In essence a stock
dividend of this sort has the same overall effect as the payment of an
equivalent amount of cash out of earnings when accompanied by the sale
of additional shares of like total value to the shareholders. However, a
straight stock dividend has an important tax advantage over the
otherwise equivalent combination of cash dividends with stock
subscription rights, which is the almost standard practice for
public-utility companies.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange has set the figure of 25% as a practical
dividing line between stock splits and stock dividends. Those of 25% or
more need not be accompanied by the transfer of their market value from
earned surplus to capital, and so forth.† Some companies, especially
banks, still follow the old practice of declaring any kind of stock
dividend they please—e.g., one of 10%, not related to recent
earnings—and these instances maintain an undesirable confusion in the
financial world.</p>
<p>We have long been a strong advocate of a systematic and clearly
enunciated policy with respect to the payment of cash and stock
dividends. Under such a policy, stock dividends are paid periodically to
capitalize all or a stated portion of the earnings reinvested in the
business. Such a policy—covering 100% of the reinvested earnings—has
been followed by Purex, Government Employees Insurance, and perhaps a
few others.*</p>
<p>Stock dividends of all types seem to be disapproved of by most
academic writers on the subject. They insist that they are nothing but
pieces of paper, that they give the shareholders nothing they did not
have before, and that they entail needless expense and inconvenience.†
On our side we consider this a completely doctrinaire view, which fails
to take into account the practical and psychological realities of
investment. True, a periodic stock dividend—say of 5%—changes only the
“form” of the owners’ investment. He has 105 shares in place of 100; but
without the stock dividend the original 100 shares would have
represented the same ownership interest now embodied in his 105 shares.
Nonetheless, the change of form is actually one of real importance and
value to him. If he wishes to cash in his share of the reinvested
profits he can do so by selling the new certificate sent him, instead of
having to break up his original certificate. He can count on receiving
the same cash-dividend rate on 105 shares as formerly on his 100 shares;
a 5% rise in the cash-dividend rate without the stock dividend would not
be nearly as probable.*</p>
<p>The advantages of a periodic stock-dividend policy are most evident
when it is compared with the usual practice of the public-utility
companies of paying liberal cash dividends and then taking back a good
part of this money from the shareholders by selling them additional
stock (through subscription rights).† As we mentioned above, the
shareholders would find themselves in exactly the same position if they
received stock dividends in lieu of the popular combination of cash
dividends followed by stock subscriptions—except that they would save
the income tax otherwise paid on the cash dividends. Those who need or
wish the maximum annual cash income, with no additional stock, can get
this result by selling their stock dividends, in the same way as they
sell their subscription rights under present practice.</p>
<p>The aggregate amount of income tax that could be saved by
substituting stock dividends for the present
stock-dividends-plus-subscription-rights combination is enormous. We
urge that this change be made by the public utilities, despite its
adverse effect on the U.S. Treasury, because we are convinced that it is
completely inequitable to impose a second (personal) income tax on
earnings which are not really received by the shareholders, since the
companies take the same money back through sales of stock.*</p>
<p>Efficient corporations continuously modernize their facilities, their
products, their bookkeeping, their management-training programs, their
employee relations. It is high time they thought about modernizing their
major financial practices, not the least important of which is their
dividend policy.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 19</p>
<p>The most dangerous untruths are truths slightly distorted.</p>
<p>—G. C. Lichtenberg</p>
<p>Why Did Graham Throw in the Towel?</p>
<p>Perhaps no other part of The Intelligent Investor was more
drastically changed by Graham than this. In the first edition, this
chapter was one of a pair that together ran nearly 34 pages. That
original section (“The Investor as Business Owner”) dealt with
shareholders’ voting rights, ways of judging the quality of corporate
management, and techniques for detecting conflicts of interest between
insiders and outside investors. By his last revised edition, however,
Graham had pared the whole discussion back to less than eight terse
pages about dividends.</p>
<p>Why did Graham cut away more than three-quarters of his original
argument? After decades of exhortation, he evidently had given up hope
that investors would ever take any interest in monitoring the behavior
of corporate managers.</p>
<p>But the latest epidemic of scandal—allegations of managerial
misbehavior, shady accounting, or tax maneuvers at major firms like AOL,
Enron, Global Crossing, Sprint, Tyco, and WorldCom—is a stark reminder
that Graham’s earlier warnings about the need for eternal vigilance are
more vital than ever. Let’s bring them back and discuss them in light of
today’s events.</p>
<p>Theory Versus Practice</p>
<p>Graham begins his original (1949) discussion of “The Investor as
Business Owner” by pointing out that, in theory, “the stockholders as a
class are king. Acting as a majority they can hire and fire managements
and bend them completely to their will.” But, in practice, says
Graham,</p>
<p>the shareholders are a complete washout. As a class they show neither
intelligence nor alertness. They vote in sheeplike fashion for whatever
the management recommends and no matter how poor the management’s record
of accomplishment may be…. The only way toinspire the average American
shareholder to take any independently intelligent action would be by
exploding a firecracker under him…. We cannot resist pointing out the
paradoxical fact that Jesus seems to have been a more practical
businessman than are American shareholders.1</p>
<p>Graham wants you to realize something basic but incredibly profound:
When you buy a stock, you become an owner of the company. Its managers,
all the way up to the CEO, work for you. Its board of directors must
answer to you. Its cash belongs to you. Its businesses are your
property. If you don’t like how your company is being managed, you have
the right to demand that the managers be fired, the directors be
changed, or the property be sold. “Stockholders,” declares Graham,
“should wake up.”2</p>
<p>The Intelligent Owner</p>
<p>Today’s investors have forgotten Graham’s message. They put most of
their effort into buying a stock, a little into selling it—but none into
owning it. “Certainly,” Graham reminds us, “there is just as much reason
to exercise care and judgment in being as in becoming a
stockholder.”3</p>
<p>So how should you, as an intelligent investor, go about being an
intelligent owner? Graham starts by telling us that “there are just two
basic questions to which stockholders should turn their attention:</p>
<p>Is the management reasonably efficient?</p>
<p>Are the interests of the average outside shareholder receiving proper
recognition?”4</p>
<p>You should judge the efficiency of management by comparing each
company’s profitability, size, and competitiveness against similar firms
in its industry. What if you conclude that the managers are no good?
Then, urges Graham,</p>
<p>A few of the more substantial stockholders should become convinced
that a change is needed and should be willing to work toward that end.
Second, the rank and file of the stockholders should be open-minded
enough to read the proxy material and to weigh the arguments on both
sides. They must at least be able to know when their company has been
unsuccessful and be ready to demand more than artful platitudes as a
vindication of the incumbent management. Third, it would be most
helpful, when the figures clearly show that the results are well below
average, if it became the custom to call in outside business engineers
to pass upon the policies and competence of the management.5</p>
<p>THE ENRON END-RUN</p>
<p>Back in 1999, Enron Corp. ranked seventh on the Fortune 500 list of
America’s top companies. The energy giant’s revenues, assets, and
earnings were all rising like rockets.</p>
<p>But what if an investor had ignored the glamour and glittering
numbers—and had simply put Enron’s 1999 proxy statement under the
microscope of common sense? Under the heading “Certain Transactions,”
the proxy disclosed that Enron’s chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow,
was the “managing member” of two partnerships, LJM1 and LJM2, that
bought “energy and communications related investments.” And where was
LJM1 and LJM2 buying from? Why, where else but from Enron! The proxy
reported that the partnerships had already bought 70 million of assets
from Enron—sometimes using money borrowed from Enron.</p>
<p>The intelligent investor would immediately have asked:</p>
<p>Did Enron’s directors approve this arrangement? (Yes, said the
proxy.)</p>
<p>Would Fastow get a piece of LJM’s profits? (Yes, said the proxy.)</p>
<p>As Enron’s chief financial officer, was Fastow obligated to act
exclusively in the interests of Enron’s shareholders? (Of course.)</p>
<p>Was Fastow therefore duty-bound to maximize the price Enron obtained
for any assets it sold? (Absolutely.)</p>
<p>But if LJM paid a high price for Enron’s assets, would that lower
LJM’s potential profits—and Fastow’s personal income? (Clearly.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, if LJM paid a low price, would that raise profits
for Fastow and his partnerships, but hurt Enron’s income? (Clearly.)</p>
<p>Should Enron lend Fastow’s partnerships any money to buy assets from
Enron that might generate a personal profit for Fastow? (Say what?!)</p>
<p>Doesn’t all this constitute profoundly disturbing conflicts of
interest? (No other answer is even possible.)</p>
<p>What does this arrangement say about the judgment of the directors
who approved it? (It says you should take your investment dollars
elsewhere.)</p>
<p>Two clear lessons emerge from this disaster: Never dig so deep into
the numbers that you check your common sense at the door, and always
read the proxy statement before (and after) you buy a stock.</p>
<p>What is “proxy material” and why does Graham insist that you read it?
In its proxy statement, which it sends to every shareholder, a company
announces the agenda for its annual meeting and discloses details about
the compensation and stock ownership of managers and directors, along
with transactions between insiders and the company. Shareholders are
asked to vote on which accounting firm should audit the books and who
should serve on the board of directors. If you use your common sense
while reading the proxy, this document can be like a canary in a coal
mine—an early warning system signaling that something is wrong. (See the
Enron sidebar above.)</p>
<p>Yet, on average, between a third and a half of all individual
investors cannot be bothered to vote their proxies.6 Do they even read
them?</p>
<p>Understanding and voting your proxy is as every bit as fundamental to
being an intelligent investor as following the news and voting your
conscience is to being a good citizen. It doesn’t matter whether you own
10% of a company or, with your piddling 100 shares, just 1/10.000 of 1%.
If you’ve never read the proxy of a stock you own, and the company goes
bust, the only person you should blame is yourself. If you do read the
proxy and see things that disturb you, then:</p>
<p>vote against every director to let them know you disapprove</p>
<p>attend the annual meeting and speak up for your rights</p>
<p>find an online message board devoted to the stock (like those at
http://finance.yahoo.com) and rally other investors to join your
cause.</p>
<p>Graham had another idea that could benefit today’s investors:</p>
<p>…there are advantages to be gained through the selection of one or
more professional and independent directors. These should be men of wide
business experience who can turn a fresh and expert eye on the problems
of the enterprise…. They should submit a separateannual report,
addressed directly to the stockholders and containing their views on the
major question which concerns the owners of the enterprise: “Is the
business showing the results for the outside stockholder which could be
expected of it under proper management? If not, why—and what should be
done about it?7</p>
<p>One can only imagine the consternation that Graham’s proposal would
cause among the corporate cronies and golfing buddies who constitute so
many of today’s “independent” directors. (Let’s not suggest that it
might send a shudder of fear down their spines, since most independent
directors do not appear to have a backbone.)</p>
<p>Whose Money Is It, Anyway?</p>
<p>Now let’s look at Graham’s second criterion—whether management acts
in the best interests of outside investors. Managers have always told
shareholders that they—the managers—know best what to do with the
company’s cash. Graham saw right through this managerial malarkey:</p>
<p>A company’s management may run the business well and yet not give the
outside stockholders the right results for them, because its efficiency
is confined to operations and does not extend to the best use of the
capital. The objective of efficient operation is to produce at low cost
and to find the most profitable articles to sell. Efficient finance
requires that the stockholders’ money be working in forms most suitable
to their interest. This is a question in which management, as such, has
little interest. Actually, it almost always wants as much capital from
the owners as it can possibly get, in order to minimize its own
financial problems. Thus the typical management will operate with more
capital than necessary, if the stockholders permit it—which they often
do.8</p>
<p>In the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, the managements of
leading technology companies took this “Daddy-Knows-Best” attitude to
new extremes. The argument went like this: Why should you demand a
dividend when we can invest that cash for you and turn it into a rising
share price? Just look at the way our stock has been going up—doesn’t
that prove that we can turn your pennies into dollars better than you
can?</p>
<p>Incredibly, investors fell for it hook, line, and sinker. Daddy Knows
Best became such gospel that, by 1999, only 3.7% of the companies that
first sold their stock to the public that year paid a dividend—down from
an average of 72.1% of all IPOs in the 1960s.9 Just look at how the
percentage of companies paying dividends (shown in the dark area) has
withered away:</p>
<p>FIGURE 19-1</p>
<p>Who Pays Dividends?</p>
<p>Source: Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, “Disappearing Dividends,”
Journal of Financial Economics, April 2001.</p>
<p>But Daddy Knows Best was nothing but bunk. While some companies put
their cash to good use, many more fell into two other categories: those
that simply wasted it, and those that piled it up far faster than they
could possibly spend it.</p>
<p>In the first group, Priceline.com wrote off 7 million in losses in
2000 after launching goofy ventures into groceries and gasoline, while
Amazon.com destroyed at least 33 million of its shareholders’ wealth by
“investing” in dot-bombs like Webvan and Ashford.com.10 And the two
biggest losses so far on record—JDS Uniphase’s 6 billion in 2001 and AOL
Time Warner’s 9 billion in 2002—occurred after companies chose not to
pay dividends but to merge with other firms at a time when their shares
were obscenely overvalued.11</p>
<p>In the second group, consider that by late 2001, Oracle Corp. had
piled up billion in cash. Cisco Systems had hoarded at least .5 billion.
Microsoft had amassed a mountain of cash 8.2 billion high—and rising by
an average of more than million per hour. 12 Just how rainy a day was
Bill Gates expecting, anyway?</p>
<p>So the anecdotal evidence clearly shows that many companies don’t
know how to turn excess cash into extra returns. What does the
statistical evidence tell us?</p>
<p>Research by money managers Robert Arnott and Clifford Asness found
that when current dividends are low, future corporate earnings also turn
out to be low. And when current dividends are high, so are future
earnings. Over 10-year periods, the average rate of earnings growth was
3.9 points greater when dividends were high than when they were
low.13</p>
<p>Columbia accounting professors Doron Nissim and Amir Ziv found that
companies that raise their dividend not only have better stock returns
but that “dividend increases are associated with 〔higher〕 future
profitability for at least four years after the dividend change.”14</p>
<p>In short, most managers are wrong when they say that they can put
your cash to better use than you can. Paying out a dividend does not
guarantee great results, but it does improve the return of the typical
stock by yanking at least some cash out of the managers’ hands before
they can either squander it or squirrel it away.</p>
<p>Selling Low, Buying High</p>
<p>What about the argument that companies can put spare cash to better
use by buying back their own shares? When a company repurchases some of
its stock, that reduces the number of its shares outstanding. Even if
its net income stays flat, the company’s earnings per share will rise,
since its total earnings will be spread across fewer shares. That, in
turn, should lift the stock price. Better yet, unlike a dividend, a
buyback is tax-free to investors who don’t sell their shares.15 Thus it
increases the value of their stock without raising their tax bill. And
if the shares are cheap, then spending spare cash to repurchase them is
an excellent use of the company’s capital.16</p>
<p>All this is true in theory. Unfortunately, in the real world, stock
buybacks have come to serve a purpose that can only be described as
sinister. Now that grants of stock options have become such a large part
of executive compensation, many companies—especially in high-tech
industries—must issue hundreds of millions of shares to give to the
managers who exercise those stock options.17 But that would jack up the
number of shares outstanding and shrink earnings per share. To
counteract that dilution, the companies must turn right back around and
repurchase millions of shares in the open market. By 2000, companies
were spending an astounding 41.8% of their total net income to
repurchase their own shares—up from 4.8% in 1980.18</p>
<p>Let’s look at Oracle Corp., the software giant. Between June 1, 1999,
and May 31, 2000, Oracle issued 101 million shares of common stock to
its senior executives and another 26 million to employees at a cost of
84 million. Meanwhile, to keep the exercise of earlier stock options
from diluting its earnings per share, Oracle spent .3 billion—or 52% of
its total revenues that year—to buy back 290.7 million shares of stock.
Oracle issued the stock to insiders at an average price of .53 per share
and repurchased it at an average price of 8.26. Sell low, buy high: Is
this any way to “enhance” shareholder value?19</p>
<p>By 2002, Oracle’s stock had fallen to less than half its peak in
2000. Now that its shares were cheaper, did Oracle hasten to buy back
more stock? Between June 1, 2001, and May 31, 2002, Oracle cut its
repurchases to .8 billion, apparently because its executives and
employees exercised fewer options that year. The same sell-low, buy-high
pattern is evident at dozens of other technology companies.</p>
<p>What’s going on here? Two surprising factors are at work:</p>
<p>Companies get a tax break when executives and employees exercise
stock options (which the IRS considers a “compensation expense” to the
company).20 In its fiscal years from 2000 through 2002, for example,
Oracle reaped .69 billion in tax benefits as insiders cashed in on
options. Sprint Corp. pocketed 78 million in tax benefits as its
executives and employees locked in .9 billion in options profits in 1999
and 2000.</p>
<p>A senior executive heavily compensated with stock options has a
vested interest in favoring stock buybacks over dividends. Why? For
technical reasons, options increase in value as the price fluctuations
of a stock grow more extreme. But dividends dampen the volatility of a
stock’s price. So, if the managers increased the dividend, they would
lower the value of their own stock options.21</p>
<p>No wonder CEOs would much rather buy back stock than pay
dividends—regardless of how overvalued the shares may be or how
drastically that may waste the resources of the outside
shareholders.</p>
<p>Keeping Their Options Open</p>
<p>Finally, drowsy investors have given their companies free rein to
over-pay executives in ways that are simply unconscionable. In 1997,
Steve Jobs, the cofounder of Apple Computer Inc., returned to the
company as its “interim” chief executive officer. Already a wealthy man,
Jobs insisted on taking a cash salary of per year. At year-end 1999, to
thank Jobs for serving as CEO “for the previous 2 1/2 years without
compensation,” the board presented him with his very own Gulfstream jet,
at a cost to the company of a mere 0 million. The next month Jobs agreed
to drop “interim” from his job title, and the board rewarded him with
options on 20 million shares. (Until then, Jobs had held a grand total
of two shares of Apple stock.)</p>
<p>The principle behind such option grants is to align the interests of
managers with outside investors. If you are an outside Apple
shareholder, you want its managers to be rewarded only if Apple’s stock
earns superior returns. Nothing else could possibly be fair to you and
the other owners of the company. But, as John Bogle, former chairman of
the Vanguard funds, points out, nearly all managers sell the stock they
receive immediately after exercising their options. How could dumping
millions of shares for an instant profit possibly align their interests
with those of the company’s loyal long-term shareholders?</p>
<p>In Jobs’ case, if Apple stock rises by just 5% annually through the
beginning of 2010, he will be able to cash in his options for 48.3
million. In other words, even if Apple’s stock earns no better than half
the long-term average return of the overall stock market, Jobs will land
a half-a-billion dollar windfall.22 Does that align his interests with
those of Apple’s shareholders—or malign the trust that Apple’s
shareholders have placed in the board of directors?</p>
<p>Reading proxy statements vigilantly, the intelligent owner will vote
against any executive compensation plan that uses option grants to turn
more than 3% of the company’s shares outstanding over to the managers.
And you should veto any plan that does not make option grants contingent
on a fair and enduring measure of superior results— say, outperforming
the average stock in the same industry for a period of at least five
years. No CEO ever deserves to make himself rich if he has produced poor
results for you.</p>
<p>A Final Thought</p>
<p>Let’s go back to Graham’s suggestion that every company’s independent
board members should have to report to the shareholders in writing on
whether the business is properly managed on behalf of its true owners.
What if the independent directors also had to justify the company’s
policies on dividends and share repurchases? What if they had to
describe exactly how they determined that the company’s senior
management was not overpaid? And what if every investor became an
intelligent owner and actually read that report?</p>
