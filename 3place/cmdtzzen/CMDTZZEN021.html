<h4 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h4>
<p>“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment</p>
<p>In the old legend the wise men finally boiled down the history of
mortal affairs into the single phrase, “This too will pass.”* Confronted
with a like challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into
three words, we venture the motto, MARGIN OF SAFETY. This is the thread
that runs through all the preceding discussion of investment
policy—often explicitly, sometimes in a less direct fashion. Let us try
now, briefly, to trace that idea in a connected argument.</p>
<p>All experienced investors recognize that the margin-of-safety concept
is essential to the choice of sound bonds and preferred stocks. For
example, a railroad should have earned its total fixed charges better
than five times (before income tax), taking a period of years, for its
bonds to qualify as investment-grade issues. This past ability to earn
in excess of interest requirements constitutes the margin of safety that
is counted on to protect the investor against loss or discomfiture in
the event of some future decline in net income. (The margin above
charges may be stated in other ways— for example, in the percentage by
which revenues or profits may decline before the balance after interest
disappears—but the underlying idea remains the same.)</p>
<p>The bond investor does not expect future average earnings to work out
the same as in the past; if he were sure of that, the margin demanded
might be small. Nor does he rely to any controlling extent on his
judgment as to whether future earnings will be materially better or
poorer than in the past, if he did that, he would have to measure his
margin in terms of a carefully projected income account, instead of
emphasizing the margin shown in the past record. Here the function of
the margin of safety is, in essence, that of rendering unnecessary an
accurate estimate of the future. If the margin is a large one, then it
is enough to assume that future earnings will not fall far below those
of the past in order for an investor to feel sufficiently protected
against the vicissitudes of time.</p>
<p>The margin of safety for bonds may be calculated, alternatively, by
comparing the total value of the enterprise with the amount of debt. (A
similar calculation may be made for a preferred-stock issue.) If the
business owes 0 million and is fairly worth 0 million, there is room for
a shrinkage of two-thirds in value—at least theoretically—before the
bondholders will suffer loss. The amount of this extra value, or
“cushion,” above the debt may be approximated by using the average
market price of the junior stock issues over a period of years. Since
average stock prices are generally related to average earning power, the
margin of “enterprise value” over debt and the margin of earnings over
charges will in most cases yield similar results.</p>
<p>So much for the margin-of-safety concept as applied to “fixed-value
investments.” Can it be carried over into the field of common stocks?
Yes, but with some necessary modifications.</p>
<p>There are instances where a common stock may be considered sound
because it enjoys a margin of safety as large as that of a good bond.
This will occur, for example, when a company has outstanding only common
stock that under depression conditions is selling for less than the
amount of bonds that could safely be issued against its property and
earning power.* That was the position of a host of strongly financed
industrial companies at the low price levels of 1932–33. In such
instances the investor can obtain the margin of safety associated with a
bond, plus all the chances of larger income and principal appreciation
inherent in a common stock. (The only thing he lacks is the legal power
to insist on dividend payments “or else”—but this is a small drawback as
compared with his advantages.) Common stocks bought under such
circumstances will supply an ideal, though infrequent, combination of
safety and profit opportunity. As a quite recent example of this
condition, let us mention once more National Presto Industries stock,
which sold for a total enterprise value of 3 million in 1972. With its 6
millions of recent earnings before taxes the company could easily have
supported this amount of bonds.</p>
<p>In the ordinary common stock, bought for investment under normal
conditions, the margin of safety lies in an expected earning power
considerably above the going rate for bonds. In former editions we
elucidated this point with the following figures:</p>
<p>Assume in a typical case that the earning power is 9% on the price
and that the bond rate is 4%; then the stockbuyer will have an average
annual margin of 5% accruing in his favor. Some of the excess is paid to
him in the dividend rate; even though spent by him, it enters into his
overall investment result. The undistributed balance is reinvested in
the business for his account. In many cases such reinvested earnings
fail to add commensurately to the earning power and value of his stock.
(That is why the market has a stubborn habit of valuing earnings
disbursed in dividends more generously than the portion retained in the
business.)* But, if the picture is viewed as a whole, there is a
reasonably close connection between the growth of corporate surpluses
through reinvested earnings and the growth of corporate values.</p>
<p>Over a ten-year period the typical excess of stock earning power over
bond interest may aggregate 50% of the price paid. This figure is
sufficient to provide a very real margin of safety—which, under
favorable conditions, will prevent or minimize a loss. If such a margin
is present in each of a diversified list of twenty or more stocks, the
probability of a favorable result under “fairly normal conditions”
becomes very large. That is why the policy of investing in
representative common stocks does not require high qualities of insight
and foresight to work out successfully. If the purchases are made at the
average level of the market over a span of years, the prices paid should
carry with them assurance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to
investors lies in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of
the market, or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more
than average risk of diminished earning power.</p>
<p>As we see it, the whole problem of common-stock investment under 1972
conditions lies in the fact that “in a typical case” the earning power
is now much less than 9% on the price paid.* Let us assume that by
concentrating somewhat on the low-multiplier issues among the large
companies a defensive investor may now acquire equities at 12 times
recent earnings—i.e., with an earnings return of 8.33% on cost. He may
obtain a dividend yield of about 4%, and he will have 4.33% of his cost
reinvested in the business for his account. On this basis, the excess of
stock earning power over bond interest over a ten-year basis would still
be too small to constitute an adequate margin of safety. For that reason
we feel that there are real risks now even in a diversified list of
sound common stocks. The risks may be fully offset by the profit
possibilities of the list; and indeed the investor may have no choice
but to incur them—for otherwise he may run an even greater risk of
holding only fixed claims payable in steadily depreciating dollars.
Nonetheless the investor would do well to recognize, and to accept as
philosophically as he can, that the old package of good profit
possibilities combined with small ultimate risk is no longer available
to him.*</p>
<p>However, the risk of paying too high a price for good-quality
stocks—while a real one—is not the chief hazard confronting the average
buyer of securities. Observation over many years has taught us that the
chief losses to investors come from the purchase of low-quality
securities at times of favorable business conditions. The purchasers
view the current good earnings as equivalent to “earning power” and
assume that prosperity is synonymous with safety. It is in those years
that bonds and preferred stocks of inferior grade can be sold to the
public at a price around par, because they carry a little higher income
return or a deceptively attractive conversion privilege. It is then,
also, that common stocks of obscure companies can be floated at prices
far above the tangible investment, on the strength of two or three years
of excellent growth.</p>
<p>These securities do not offer an adequate margin of safety in any
admissible sense of the term. Coverage of interest charges and preferred
dividends must be tested over a number of years, including preferably a
period of subnormal business such as in 1970–71. The same is ordinarily
true of common-stock earnings if they are to qualify as indicators of
earning power. Thus it follows that most of the fair-weather
investments, acquired at fair-weather prices, are destined to suffer
disturbing price declines when the horizon clouds over—and often sooner
than that. Nor can the investor count with confidence on an eventual
recovery—although this does come about in some proportion of the
cases—for he has never had a real safety margin to tide him through
adversity.</p>
<p>The philosophy of investment in growth stocks parallels in part and
in part contravenes the margin-of-safety principle. The growth-stock
buyer relies on an expected earning power that is greater than the
average shown in the past. Thus he may be said to substitute these
expected earnings for the past record in calculating his margin of
safety. In investment theory there is no reason why carefully estimated
future earnings should be a less reliable guide than the bare record of
the past; in fact, security analysis is coming more and more to prefer a
competently executed evaluation of the future. Thus the growth-stock
approach may supply as dependable a margin of safety as is found in the
ordinary investment—provided the calculation of the future is
conservatively made, and provided it shows a satisfactory margin in
relation to the price paid.</p>
<p>The danger in a growth-stock program lies precisely here. For such
favored issues the market has a tendency to set prices that will not be
adequately protected by a conservative projection of future earnings.
(It is a basic rule of prudent investment that all estimates, when they
differ from past performance, must err at least slightly on the side of
understatement.) The margin of safety is always dependent on the price
paid. It will be large at one price, small at some higher price,
nonexistent at some still higher price. If, as we suggest, the average
market level of most growth stocks is too high to provide an adequate
margin of safety for the buyer, then a simple technique of diversified
buying in this field may not work out satisfactorily. A special degree
of foresight and judgment will be needed, in order that wise individual
selections may overcome the hazards inherent in the customary market
level of such issues as a whole.</p>
<p>The margin-of-safety idea becomes much more evident when we apply it
to the field of undervalued or bargain securities. We have here, by
definition, a favorable difference between price on the one hand and
indicated or appraised value on the other. That difference is the safety
margin. It is available for absorbing the effect of miscalculations or
worse than average luck. The buyer of bargain issues places particular
emphasis on the ability of the investment to withstand adverse
developments. For in most such cases he has no real enthusiasm about the
company’s prospects. True, if the prospects are definitely bad the
investor will prefer to avoid the security no matter how low the price.
But the field of undervalued issues is drawn from the many
concerns—perhaps a majority of the total—for which the future appears
neither distinctly promising nor distinctly unpromising. If these are
bought on a bargain basis, even a moderate decline in the earning power
need not prevent the investment from showing satisfactory results. The
margin of safety will then have served its proper purpose.</p>
<p>Theory of Diversification</p>
<p>There is a close logical connection between the concept of a safety
margin and the principle of diversification. One is correlative with the
other. Even with a margin in the investor’s favor, an individual
security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees only that he has
a better chance for profit than for loss—not that loss is impossible.
But as the number of such commitments is increased the more certain does
it become that the aggregate of the profits will exceed the aggregate of
the losses. That is the simple basis of the insurance-underwriting
business.</p>
<p>Diversification is an established tenet of conservative investment.
By accepting it so universally, investors are really demonstrating their
acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to which diversification
is the companion. This point may be made more colorful by a reference to
the arithmetic of roulette. If a man bets on a single number, he is paid
5 profit when he wins—but the chances are 37 to 1 that he will lose. He
has a “negative margin of safety.” In his case diversification is
foolish. The more numbers he bets on, the smaller his chance of ending
with a profit. If he regularly bets on every number (including 0 and
00), he is certain to lose on each turn of the wheel. But suppose the
winner received 9 profit instead of 5. Then he would have a small but
important margin of safety. Therefore, the more numbers he wagers on,
the better his chance of gain. And he could be certain of winning on
every spin by simply betting each on all the numbers. (Incidentally, the
two examples given actually describe the respective positions of the
player and proprietor of a wheel with 0 and 00.)*</p>
<p>A Criterion of Investment versus Speculation</p>
<p>Since there is no single definition of investment in general
acceptance, authorities have the right to define it pretty much as they
please. Many of them deny that there is any useful or dependable
difference between the concepts of investment and of speculation. We
think this skepticism is unnecessary and harmful. It is injurious
because it lends encouragement to the innate leaning of many people
toward the excitement and hazards of stock-market speculation. We
suggest that the margin-of-safety concept may be used to advantage as
the touchstone to distinguish an investment operation from a speculative
one.</p>
<p>Probably most speculators believe they have the odds in their favor
when they take their chances, and therefore they may lay claim to a
safety margin in their proceedings. Each one has the feeling that the
time is propitious for his purchase, or that his skill is superior to
the crowd’s, or that his adviser or system is trustworthy. But such
claims are unconvincing. They rest on subjective judgment, unsupported
by any body of favorable evidence or any conclusive line of reasoning.
We greatly doubt whether the man who stakes money on his view that the
market is heading up or down can ever be said to be protected by a
margin of safety in any useful sense of the phrase.</p>
<p>By contrast, the investor’s concept of the margin of safety—as
developed earlier in this chapter—rests upon simple and definite
arithmetical reasoning from statistical data. We believe, also, that it
is well supported by practical investment experience. There is no
guarantee that this fundamental quantitative approach will continue to
show favorable results under the unknown conditions of the future. But,
equally, there is no valid reason for pessimism on this score.</p>
<p>Thus, in sum, we say that to have a true investment there must be
present a true margin of safety. And a true margin of safety is one that
can be demonstrated by figures, by persuasive reasoning, and by
reference to a body of actual experience.</p>
<p>Extension of the Concept of Investment</p>
<p>To complete our discussion of the margin-of-safety principle we must
now make a further distinction between conventional and unconventional
investments. Conventional investments are appropriate for the typical
portfolio. Under this heading have always come United States government
issues and high-grade, dividend-paying common stocks. We have added
state and municipal bonds for those who will benefit sufficiently by
their tax-exempt features. Also included are first-quality corporate
bonds when, as now, they can be bought to yield sufficiently more than
United States savings bonds.</p>
<p>Unconventional investments are those that are suitable only for the
enterprising investor. They cover a wide range. The broadest category is
that of undervalued common stocks of secondary companies, which we
recommend for purchase when they can be bought at two-thirds or less of
their indicated value. Besides these, there is often a wide choice of
medium-grade corporate bonds and preferred stocks when they are selling
at such depressed prices as to be obtainable also at a considerable
discount from their apparent value. In these cases the average investor
would be inclined to call the securities speculative, because in his
mind their lack of a first-quality rating is synonymous with a lack of
investment merit.</p>
<p>It is our argument that a sufficiently low price can turn a security
of mediocre quality into a sound investment opportunity—provided that
the buyer is informed and experienced and that he practices adequate
diversification. For, if the price is low enough to create a substantial
margin of safety, the security thereby meets our criterion of
investment. Our favorite supporting illustration is taken from the field
of real-estate bonds. In the 1920s, billions of dollars’ worth of these
issues were sold at par and widely recommended as sound investments. A
large proportion had so little margin of value over debt as to be in
fact highly speculative in character. In the depression of the 1930s an
enormous quantity of these bonds defaulted their interest, and their
price collapsed—in some cases below 10 cents on the dollar. At that
stage the same advisers who had recommended them at par as safe
investments were rejecting them as paper of the most speculative and
unattractive type. But as a matter of fact the price depreciation of
about 90% made many of these securities exceedingly attractive and
reasonably safe—for the true values behind them were four or five times
the market quotation.*</p>
<p>The fact that the purchase of these bonds actually resulted in what
is generally called “a large speculative profit” did not prevent them
from having true investment qualities at their low prices. The
“speculative” profit was the purchaser’s reward for having made an
unusually shrewd investment. They could properly be called investment
opportunities, since a careful analysis would have shown that the excess
of value over price provided a large margin of safety. Thus the very
class of “fair-weather investments” which we stated above is a chief
source of serious loss to naïve security buyers is likely to afford many
sound profit opportunities to the sophisticated operator who may buy
them later at pretty much his own price.†</p>
<p>The whole field of “special situations” would come under our
definition of investment operations, because the purchase is always
predicated on a thoroughgoing analysis that promises a larger
realization than the price paid. Again there are risk factors in each
individual case, but these are allowed for in the calculations and
absorbed in the overall results of a diversified operation.</p>
<p>To carry this discussion to a logical extreme, we might suggest that
a defensible investment operation could be set up by buying such
intangible values as are represented by a group of “common-stock option
warrants” selling at historically low prices. (This example is intended
as somewhat of a shocker.)* The entire value of these warrants rests on
the possibility that the related stocks may some day advance above the
option price. At the moment they have no exercisable value. Yet, since
all investment rests on reasonable future expectations, it is proper to
view these warrants in terms of the mathematical chances that some
future bull market will create a large increase in their indicated value
and in their price. Such a study might well yield the conclusion that
there is much more to be gained in such an operation than to be lost and
that the chances of an ultimate profit are much better than those of an
ultimate loss. If that is so, there is a safety margin present even in
this unprepossessing security form. A sufficiently enterprising investor
could then include an option-warrant operation in his miscellany of
unconventional investments.1</p>
<p>To Sum Up</p>
<p>Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike. It is
amazing to see how many capable businessmen try to operate in Wall
Street with complete disregard of all the sound principles through which
they have gained success in their own undertakings. Yet every corporate
security may best be viewed, in the first instance, as an ownership
interest in, or a claim against, a specific business enterprise. And if
a person sets out to make profits from security purchases and sales, he
is embarking on a business venture of his own, which must be run in
accordance with accepted business principles if it is to have a chance
of success.</p>
<p>The first and most obvious of these principles is, “Know what you are
doing—know your business.” For the investor this means: Do not try to
make “business profits” out of securities—that is, returns in excess of
normal interest and dividend income—unless you know as much about
security values as you would need to know about the value of merchandise
that you proposed to manufacture or deal in.</p>
<p>A second business principle: “Do not let anyone else run your
business, unless (1) you can supervise his performance with adequate
care and comprehension or (2) you have unusually strong reasons for
placing implicit confidence in his integrity and ability.” For the
investor this rule should determine the conditions under which he will
permit someone else to decide what is done with his money.</p>
<p>A third business principle: “Do not enter upon an operation—that is,
manufacturing or trading in an item—unless a reliable calculation shows
that it has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit. In particular,
keep away from ventures in which you have little to gain and much to
lose.” For the enterprising investor this means that his operations for
profit should be based not on optimism but on arithmetic. For every
investor it means that when he limits his return to a small figure—as
formerly, at least, in a conventional bond or preferred stock—he must
demand convincing evidence that he is not risking a substantial part of
his principal.</p>
<p>A fourth business rule is more positive: “Have the courage of your
knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion from the facts
and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it—even though others may
hesitate or differ.” (You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd
disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are
right.) Similarly, in the world of securities, courage becomes the
supreme virtue after adequate knowledge and a tested judgment are at
hand.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the typical investor, it is by no means necessary for
his success that he bring these qualities to bear upon his
program—provided he limits his ambition to his capacity and confines his
activities within the safe and narrow path of standard, defensive
investment. To achieve satisfactory investment results is easier than
most people realize; to achieve superior results is harder than it
looks.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 20</p>
<p>If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a
universe of infinite possibilities, we may find ourselves at the mercy
of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized, or easily
referenced.</p>
<p>—Agent Fox Mulder, The X-Files</p>
<p>First, Don’t Lose</p>
<p>What is risk?</p>
<p>You’ll get different answers depending on whom, and when, you ask. In
1999, risk didn’t mean losing money; it meant making less money than
someone else. What many people feared was bumping into somebody at a
barbecue who was getting even richer even quicker by day trading dot-com
stocks than they were. Then, quite suddenly, by 2003 risk had come to
mean that the stock market might keep dropping until it wiped out
whatever traces of wealth you still had left.</p>
<p>While its meaning may seem nearly as fickle and fluctuating as the
financial markets themselves, risk has some profound and permanent
attributes. The people who take the biggest gambles and make the biggest
gains in a bull market are almost always the ones who get hurt the worst
in the bear market that inevitably follows. (Being “right” makes
speculators even more eager to take extra risk, as their confidence
catches fire.) And once you lose big money, you then have to gamble even
harder just to get back to where you were, like a racetrack or casino
gambler who desperately doubles up after every bad bet. Unless you are
phenomenally lucky, that’s a recipe for disaster. No wonder, when he was
asked to sum up everything he had learned in his long career about how
to get rich, the legendary financier J. K. Klingenstein of Wertheim
andandandand Co. answered simply: “Don’t lose.”1 This graph shows what
he meant:</p>
<p>FIGURE 20-1</p>
<p>The Cost of Loss</p>
<p>Imagine that you find a stock that you think can grow at 10% a year
even if the market only grows 5% annually. Unfortunately, you are so
enthusiastic that you pay too high a price, and the stock loses 50% of
its value the first year. Even if the stock then generates double the
market’s return, it will take you more than 16 years to overtake the
market—simply because you paid too much, and lost too much, at the
outset.</p>
<p>Losing some money is an inevitable part of investing, and there’s
nothing you can do to prevent it. But, to be an intelligent investor,
you must take responsibility for ensuring that you never lose most or
all of your money. The Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, is often
portrayed standing on tiptoe, ready to dart away in the blink of an eye.
To keep her symbolically in place, some of Lakshmi’s devotees will lash
her statue down with strips of fabric or nail its feet to the floor. For
the intelligent investor, Graham’s “margin of safety” performs the same
function: By refusing to pay too much for an investment, you minimize
the chances that your wealth will ever disappear or suddenly be
destroyed.</p>
<p>Consider this: Over the four quarters ending in December 1999, JDS
Uniphase Corp., the fiber-optics company, generated 73 million in net
sales, on which it lost 13 million. Its tangible assets totaled .5
billion. Yet, on March 7, 2000, JDS Uniphase’s stock hit 53 a share,
giving the company a total market value of roughly 43 billion.2 And
then, like most “New Era” stocks, it crashed. Anyone who bought it that
day and still clung to it at the end of 2002 faced these prospects:</p>
<p>FIGURE 20-2</p>
<p>Breaking Even Is Hard to Do</p>
<p>If you had bought JDS Uniphase at its peak price of 53.421 on March
7, 2000, and still held it at year-end 2002 (when it closed at .47), how
long would it take you to get back to your purchase price at various
annual average rates of return?</p>
<p>Even at a robust 10% annual rate of return, it will take more than 43
years to break even on this overpriced purchase!</p>
<p>The Risk is Not in Our Stocks, But in Ourselves</p>
<p>Risk exists in another dimension: inside you. If you overestimate how
well you really understand an investment, or overstate your ability to
ride out a temporary plunge in prices, it doesn’t matter what you own or
how the market does. Ultimately, financial risk resides not in what
kinds of investments you have, but in what kind of investor you are. If
you want to know what risk really is, go to the nearest bathroom and
step up to the mirror. That’s risk, gazing back at you from the
glass.</p>
<p>As you look at yourself in the mirror, what should you watch for? The
Nobel-prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains two factors
that characterize good decisions:</p>
<p>“well-calibrated confidence” (do I understand this investment as well
as I think I do?)</p>
<p>“correctly-anticipated regret” (how will I react if my analysis turns
out to be wrong?).</p>
<p>To find out whether your confidence is well-calibrated, look in the
mirror and ask yourself: “What is the likelihood that my analysis is
right?” Think carefully through these questions:</p>
<p>How much experience do I have? What is my track record with similar
decisions in the past?</p>
<p>What is the typical track record of other people who have tried this
in the past?3</p>
<p>If I am buying, someone else is selling. How likely is it that I know
something that this other person (or company) does not know?</p>
<p>If I am selling, someone else is buying. How likely is it that I know
something that this other person (or company) does not know?</p>
<p>Have I calculated how much this investment needs to go up for me to
break even after my taxes and costs of trading?</p>
<p>Next, look in the mirror to find out whether you are the kind of
person who correctly anticipates your regret. Start by asking: “Do I
fully understand the consequences if my analysis turns out to be wrong?”
Answer that question by considering these points:</p>
<p>If I’m right, I could make a lot of money. But what if I’m wrong?
Based on the historical performance of similar investments, how much
could I lose?</p>
<p>Do I have other investments that will tide me over if this decision
turns out to be wrong? Do I already hold stocks, bonds, or funds with a
proven record of going up when the kind of investment I’m considering
goes down? Am I putting too much of my capital at risk with this new
investment?</p>
<p>When I tell myself, “You have a high tolerance for risk,” how do I
know? Have I ever lost a lot of money on an investment? How did it feel?
Did I buy more, or did I bail out?</p>
<p>Am I relying on my willpower alone to prevent me from panicking at
the wrong time? Or have I controlled my own behavior in advance by
diversifying, signing an investment contract, and dollar-cost
averaging?</p>
<p>You should always remember, in the words of the psychologist Paul
Slovic, that “risk is brewed from an equal dose of two
ingredients—probabilities and consequences.”4 Before you invest, you
must ensure that you have realistically assessed your probability of
being right and how you will react to the consequences of being
wrong.</p>
<p>Pascal’s Wager</p>
<p>The investment philosopher Peter Bernstein has another way of summing
this up. He reaches back to Blaise Pascal, the great French
mathematician and theologian (1623–1662), who created a thought
experiment in which an agnostic must gamble on whether or not God
exists. The ante this person must put up for the wager is his conduct in
this life; the ultimate payoff in the gamble is the fate of his soul in
the afterlife. In this wager, Pascal asserts, “reason cannot decide” the
probability of God’s existence. Either God exists or He does not—and
only faith, not reason, can answer that question. But while the
probabilities in Pascal’s wager are a toss-up, the consequences are
perfectly clear and utterly certain. As Bernstein explains:</p>
<p>Suppose you act as though God is and 〔you〕 lead a life of virtue
and abstinence, when in fact there is no god. You will have passed up
some goodies in life, but there will be rewards as well. Now suppose you
act as though God is not and spend a life of sin, selfishness, and lust
when in fact God is. You may have had fun and thrills during the
relatively brief duration of your lifetime, but when the day of judgment
rolls around you are in big trouble.5</p>
<p>Concludes Bernstein: “In making decisions under conditions of
uncertainty, the consequences must dominate the probabilities. We never
know the future.” Thus, as Graham has reminded you in every chapter of
this book, the intelligent investor must focus not just on getting the
analysis right. You must also ensure against loss if your analysis turns
out to be wrong—as even the best analyses will be at least some of the
time. The probability of making at least one mistake at some point in
your investing lifetime is virtually 100%, and those odds are entirely
out of your control. However, you do have control over the consequences
of being wrong. Many “investors” put essentially all of their money into
dot-com stocks in 1999; an online survey of 1,338 Americans by Money
Magazine in 1999 found that nearly one-tenth of them had at least 85% of
their money in Internet stocks. By ignoring Graham’s call for a margin
of safety, these people took the wrong side of Pascal’s wager. Certain
that they knew the probabilities of being right, they did nothing to
protect themselves against the consequences of being wrong.</p>
<p>Simply by keeping your holdings permanently diversified, and refusing
to fling money at Mr. Market’s latest, craziest fashions, you can ensure
that the consequences of your mistakes will never be catastrophic. No
matter what Mr. Market throws at you, you will always be able to say,
with a quiet confidence, “This, too, shall pass away.”</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>We know very well two partners who spent a good part of their lives
handling their own and other people’s funds on Wall Street. Some hard
experience taught them it was better to be safe and careful rather than
to try to make all the money in the world. They established a rather
unique approach to security operations, which combined good profit
possibilities with sound values. They avoided anything that appeared
overpriced and were rather too quick to dispose of issues that had
advanced to levels they deemed no longer attractive. Their portfolio was
always well diversified, with more than a hundred different issues
represented. In this way they did quite well through many years of ups
and downs in the general market; they averaged about 20% per annum on
the several millions of capital they had accepted for management, and
their clients were well pleased with the results.*</p>
<p>In the year in which the first edition of this book appeared an
opportunity was offered to the partners’ fund to purchase a
half-interest in a growing enterprise. For some reason the industry did
not have Wall Street appeal at the time and the deal had been turned
down by quite a few important houses. But the pair was impressed by the
company’s possibilities; what was decisive for them was that the price
was moderate in relation to current earnings and asset value. The
partners went ahead with the acquisition, amounting in dollars to about
one-fifth of their fund. They became closely identified with the new
business interest, which prospered.†</p>
<p>In fact it did so well that the price of its shares advanced to two
hundred times or more the price paid for the half-interest. The advance
far outstripped the actual growth in profits, and almost from the start
the quotation appeared much too high in terms of the partners’ own
investment standards. But since they regarded the company as a sort of
“family business,” they continued to maintain a substantial ownership of
the shares despite the spectacular price rise. A large number of
participants in their funds did the same, and they became millionaires
through their holding in this one enterprise, plus later-organized
affiliates.*</p>
<p>Ironically enough, the aggregate of profits accruing from this single
investment decision far exceeded the sum of all the others realized
through 20 years of wide-ranging operations in the partners’ specialized
fields, involving much investigation, endless pondering, and countless
individual decisions.</p>
<p>Are there morals to this story of value to the intelligent investor?
An obvious one is that there are several different ways to make and keep
money in Wall Street. Another, not so obvious, is that one lucky break,
or one supremely shrewd decision—can we tell them apart?—may count for
more than a lifetime of journeyman efforts.1 But behind the luck, or the
crucial decision, there must usually exist a background of preparation
and disciplined capacity. One needs to be sufficiently established and
recognized so that these opportunities will knock at his particular
door. One must have the means, the judgment, and the courage to take
advantage of them.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot promise a like spectacular experience to all
intelligent investors who remain both prudent and alert through the
years. We are not going to end with J. J. Raskob’s slogan that we made
fun of at the beginning: “Everybody can be rich.” But interesting
possibilities abound on the financial scene, and the intelligent and
enterprising investor should be able to find both enjoyment and profit
in this three-ring circus. Excitement is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Commentary on Postscript</p>
<p>Successful investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it. At
first glance, when you realize that Graham put 25% of his fund into a
single stock, you might think he was gambling rashly with his investors’
money. But then, when you discover that Graham had painstakingly
established that he could liquidate GEICO for at least what he paid for
it, it becomes clear that Graham was taking very little financial risk.
But he needed enormous courage to take the psychological risk of such a
big bet on so unknown a stock.1</p>
<p>And today’s headlines are full of fearful facts and unresolved risks:
the death of the 1990s bull market, sluggish economic growth, corporate
fraud, the specters of terrorism and war. “Investors don’t like
uncertainty,” a market strategist is intoning right now on financial TV
or in today’s newspaper. But investors have never liked uncertainty—and
yet it is the most fundamental and enduring condition of the investing
world. It always has been, and it always will be. At heart,
“uncertainty” and “investing” are synonyms. In the real world, no one
has ever been given the ability to see that any particular time is the
best time to buy stocks. Without a saving faith in the future, no one
would ever invest at all. To be an investor, you must be a believer in a
better tomorrow.</p>
<p>The most literate of investors, Graham loved the story of Ulysses,
told through the poetry of Homer, Alfred Tennyson, and Dante. Late in
his life, Graham relished the scene in Dante’s Inferno when Ulysses
describes inspiring his crew to sail westward into the unknown waters
beyond the gates of Hercules:</p>
<p>“O brothers,” I said, “who after a hundred thousand</p>
<p>perils have reached the west,</p>
<p>in this little waking vigil</p>
<p>that still remains to our senses,</p>
<p>let us not choose to avoid the experience</p>
<p>of the unpeopled world that lies behind the sun.</p>
<p>Consider the seeds from which you sprang:</p>
<p>You were made not to live like beasts,</p>
<p>but to seek virtue and understanding.”</p>
<p>With this little oration I made my shipmates</p>
<p>so eager for the voyage</p>
<p>that it would have hurt to hold them back.</p>
<p>And we swung our stern toward the morning</p>
<p>and turned our oars into wings for the wild flight.2</p>
<p>Investing, too, is an adventure; the financial future is always an
uncharted world. With Graham as your guide, your lifelong investing
voyage should be as safe and confident as it is adventurous.</p>

<li>The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville</li>
</ol>
<p>by Warren E. Buffett</p>
<p>EDITOR’S NOTE: This article is an edited transcript of a talk given
at Columbia University in 1984 commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of
Security Analysis, written by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd. This
specialized volume first introduced the ideas later popularized in The
Intelligent Investor. Buffett’s essay offers a fascinating study of how
Graham’s disciples have used Graham’s value investing approach to
realize phenomenal success in the stock market.</p>
<p>Is the Graham and Dodd “look for values with a significant margin of
safety relative to prices” approach to security analysis out of date?
Many of the professors who write textbooks today say yes. They argue
that the stock market is efficient; that is, that stock prices reflect
everything that is known about a company’s prospects and about the state
of the economy. There are no undervalued stocks, these theorists argue,
because there are smart security analysts who utilize all available
information to ensure unfailingly appropriate prices. Investors who seem
to beat the market year after year are just lucky. “If prices fully
reflect available information, this sort of investment adeptness is
ruled out,” writes one of today’s textbook authors.</p>
<p>Well, maybe. But I want to present to you a group of investors who
have, year in and year out, beaten the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500
stock index. The hypothesis that they do this by pure chance is at least
worth examining. Crucial to this examination is the fact that these
winners were all well known to me and pre-identified as superior
investors, the most recent identification occurring over fifteen years
ago. Absent this condition—that is, if I had just recently searched
among thousands of records to select a few names for you this morning—I
would advise you to stop reading right here. I should add that all these
records have been audited. And I should further add that I have known
many of those who have invested with these managers, and the checks
received by those participants over the years have matched the stated
records.</p>
<p>Before we begin this examination, I would like you to imagine a
national coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million
Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar.
They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a
coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called
wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the
stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten
flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the
United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each
will have won a little over ,000.</p>
<p>Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about
this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at
cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of
the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights
they bring to the field of flipping.</p>
<p>Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from
the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have
successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this
exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over million. 25
million would have been lost, 25 million would have been won.</p>
<p>By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will probably
write books on “How I Turned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days
Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet, they’ll probably start
jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flipping
and tackling skeptical professors with, “If it can’t be done, why are
there 215 of us?”</p>
<p>But then some business school professor will probably be rude enough
to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a
similar exercise, the results would be much the same—215 egotistical
orangutans with 20 straight winning flips.</p>
<p>I would argue, however, that there are some important differences in
the examples I am going to present. For one thing, if (a) you had taken
225 million orangutans distributed roughly as the U.S. population is; if
(b) 215 winners were left after 20 days; and if(c) you found that 40
came from a particular zoo in Omaha, you would be pretty sure you were
on to something. So you would probably go out and ask the zookeeper
about what he’s feeding them, whether they had special exercises, what
books they read, and who knows what else. That is, if you found any
really extraordinary concentrations of success, you might want to see if
you could identify concentrations of unusual characteristics that might
be causal factors.</p>
<p>Scientific inquiry naturally follows such a pattern. If you were
trying to analyze possible causes of a rare type of cancer—with, say,
1,500 cases a year in the United States—and you found that 400 of them
occurred in some little mining town in Montana, you would get very
interested in the water there, or the occupation of those afflicted, or
other variables. You know that it’s not random chance that 400 come from
a small area. You would not necessarily know the causal factors, but you
would know where to search.</p>
<p>I submit to you that there are ways of defining an origin other than
geography. In addition to geographical origins, there can be what I call
an intellectual origin. I think you will find that a disproportionate
number of successful coin-flippers in the investment world came from a
very small intellectual village that could be called
Graham-and-Doddsville. A concentration of winners that simply cannot be
explained by chance can be traced to this particular intellectual
village.</p>
<p>Conditions could exist that would make even that concentration
unimportant. Perhaps 100 people were simply imitating the coin-flipping
call of some terribly persuasive personality. When he called heads, 100
followers automatically called that coin the same way. If the leader was
part of the 215 left at the end, the fact that 100 came from the same
intellectual origin would mean nothing. You would simply be identifying
one case as a hundred cases. Similarly, let’s assume that you lived in a
strongly patriarchal society and every family in the United States
conveniently consisted of ten members. Further assume that the
patriarchal culture was so strong that, when the 225 million people went
out the first day, every member of the family identified with the
father’s call. Now, at the end of the 20-day period, you would have 215
winners, and you would find that they came from only 21.5 families. Some
naive types might say that this indicates an enormous hereditary factor
as an explanation of successful coin-flipping. But, of course, it would
have no significance at all because it would simply mean that you didn’t
have 215 individual winners, but rather 21.5 randomly distributed
families who were winners.</p>
<p>In this group of successful investors that I want to consider, there
has been a common intellectual patriarch, Ben Graham. But the children
who left the house of this intellectual patriarch have called their
“flips” in very different ways. They have gone to different places and
bought and sold different stocks and companies, yet they have had a
combined record that simply can’t be explained by random chance. It
certainly cannot be explained by the fact that they are all calling
flips identically because a leader is signaling the calls to make. The
patriarch has merely set forth the intellectual theory for making
coin-calling decisions, but each student has decided on his own manner
of applying the theory.</p>
<p>The common intellectual theme of the investors from
Graham-and-Doddsville is this: they search for discrepancies between the
value of a business and the price of small pieces of that business in
the market. Essentially, they exploit those discrepancies without the
efficient market theorist’s concern as to whether the stocks are bought
on Monday or Thursday, or whether it is January or July, etc.
Incidentally, when businessmen buy businesses—which is just what our
Graham andandandand Dodd investors are doing through the medium of
marketable stocks—I doubt that many are cranking into their purchase
decision the day of the week or the month in which the transaction is
going to occur. If it doesn’t make any difference whether all of a
business is being bought on a Monday or a Friday, I am baffled why
academicians invest extensive time and effort to see whether it makes a
difference when buying small pieces of those same businesses. Our Graham
andandandand Dodd investors, needless to say, do not discuss beta, the
capital asset pricing model, or covariance in returns among securities.
These are not subjects of any interest to them. In fact, most of them
would have difficulty defining those terms. The investors simply focus
on two variables: price and value.</p>
<p>I always find it extraordinary that so many studies are made of price
and volume behavior, the stuff of chartists. Can you imagine buying an
entire business simply because the price of the business had been marked
up substantially last week and the week before? Of course, the reason a
lot of studies are made of these price and volume variables is that now,
in the age of computers, there are almost endless data available about
them. It isn’t necessarily because such studies have any utility; it’s
simply that the data are there and academicians have worked hard to
learn the mathematical skills needed to manipulate them. Once these
skills are acquired, it seems sinful not to use them, even if the usage
has no utility or negative utility. As a friend said, to a man with a
hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>
<p>I think the group that we have identified by a common intellectual
home is worthy of study. Incidentally, despite all the academic studies
of the influence of such variables as price, volume, seasonality,
capitalization size, etc., upon stock performance, no interest has been
evidenced in studying the methods of this unusual concentration of
value-oriented winners.</p>
<p>I begin this study of results by going back to a group of four of us
who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation from 1954 through 1956. There
were only four—I have not selected these names from among thousands. I
offered to go to work at Graham-Newman for nothing after I took Ben
Graham’s class, but he turned me down as overvalued. He took this value
stuff very seriously! After much pestering he finally hired me. There
were three partners and four of us at the “peasant” level. All four left
between 1955 and 1957 when the firm was wound up, and it’s possible to
trace the record of three.</p>
<p>The first example (see Table 1, pages 549–550) is that of Walter
Schloss. Walter never went to college, but took a course from Ben Graham
at night at the New York Institute of Finance. Walter left Graham-Newman
in 1955 and achieved the record shown here over 28 years.</p>
<p>Here is what “Adam Smith”—after I told him about Walter—wrote about
him in Supermoney (1972):</p>
<p>He has no connections or access to useful information. Practically no
one in Wall Street knows him and he is not fed any ideas. He looks up
the numbers in the manuals and sends for the annual reports, and that’s
about it.</p>
<p>In introducing me to 〔Schloss〕 Warren had also, to my mind,
described himself. “He never forgets that he is handling other people’s
money and this reinforces his normal strong aversion to loss.” He has
total integrity and a realistic picture of himself. Money is real to him
and stocks are real—and from this flows an attraction to the “margin of
safety” principle.</p>
<p>Walter has diversified enormously, owning well over 100 stocks
currently. He knows how to identify securities that sell at considerably
less than their value to a private owner. And that’s all he does. He
doesn’t worry about whether it’s January, he doesn’t worry about whether
it’s Monday, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s an election year. He
simply says, if a business is worth a dollar and I can buy it for 40
cents, something good may happen to me. And he does it over and over and
over again. He owns many more stocks than I do—and is far less
interested in the underlying nature of the business: I don’t seem to
have very much influence on Walter. That’s one of his strengths; no one
has much influence on him.</p>
<p>The second case is Tom Knapp, who also worked at Graham-Newman with
me. Tom was a chemistry major at Princeton before the war; when he came
back from the war, he was a beach bum. And then one day he read that
Dave Dodd was giving a night course in investments at Columbia. Tom took
it on a noncredit basis, and he got so interested in the subject from
taking that course that he came up and enrolled at Columbia Business
School, where he got the MBA degree. He took Dodd’s course again, and
took Ben Graham’s course. Incidentally, 35 years later I called Tom to
ascertain some of the facts involved here and I found him on the beach
again. The only difference is that now he owns the beach!</p>
<p>In 1968 Tom Knapp and Ed Anderson, also a Graham disciple, along with
one or two other fellows of similar persuasion, formed Tweedy, Browne
Partners, and their investment results appear in Table 2. Tweedy, Browne
built that record with very wide diversification. They occasionally
bought control of businesses, but the record of the passive investments
is equal to the record of the control investments.</p>
<p>Table 3 describes the third member of the group who formed Buffett
Partnership in 1957. The best thing he did was to quit in 1969. Since
then, in a sense, Berkshire Hathaway has been a continuation of the
partnership in some respects. There is no single index I can give you
that I would feel would be a fair test of investment management at
Berkshire. But I think that any way you figure it, it has been
satisfactory.</p>
<p>Table 4 shows the record of the Sequoia Fund, which is managed by a
man whom I met in 1951 in Ben Graham’s class, Bill Ruane. After getting
out of Harvard Business School, he went to Wall Street. Then he realized
that he needed to get a real business education so he came up to take
Ben’s course at Columbia, where we met in early 1951. Bill’s record from
1951 to 1970, working with relatively small sums, was far better than
average. When I wound up Buffett Partnership I asked Bill if he would
set up a fund to handle all our partners, so he set up the Sequoia Fund.
He set it up at a terrible time, just when I was quitting. He went right
into the two-tier market and all the difficulties that made for
comparative performance for value-oriented investors. I am happy to say
that my partners, to an amazing degree, not only stayed with him but
added money, with the happy result shown.</p>
<p>There’s no hindsight involved here. Bill was the only person I
recommended to my partners, and I said at the time that if he achieved a
four-point-per-annum advantage over the Standard andandandand Poor’s,
that would be solid performance. Bill has achieved well over that,
working with progressively larger sums of money. That makes things much
more difficult. Size is the anchor of performance. There is no question
about it. It doesn’t mean you can’t do better than average when you get
larger, but the margin shrinks. And if you ever get so you’re managing
two trillion dollars, and that happens to be the amount of the total
equity evaluation in the economy, don’t think that you’ll do better than
average!</p>
<p>I should add that in the records we’ve looked at so far, throughout
this whole period there was practically no duplication in these
portfolios. These are men who select securities based on discrepancies
between price and value, but they make their selections very
differently. Walter’s largest holdings have been such stalwarts as
Hudson Pulp andandandand Paper and Jeddo Highland Coal and New York Trap
Rock Company and all those other names that come instantly to mind to
even a casual reader of the business pages. Tweedy Browne’s selections
have sunk even well below that level in terms of name recognition. On
the other hand, Bill has worked with big companies. The overlap among
these portfolios has been very, very low. These records do not reflect
one guy calling the flip and fifty people yelling out the same thing
after him.</p>
<p>Table 5 is the record of a friend of mine who is a Harvard Law
graduate, who set up a major law firm. I ran into him in about 1960 and
told him that law was fine as a hobby but he could do better. He set up
a partnership quite the opposite of Walter’s. His portfolio was
concentrated in very few securities and therefore his record was much
more volatile but it was based on the same discount-from-value approach.
He was willing to accept greater peaks and valleys of performance, and
he happens to be a fellow whose whole psyche goes toward concentration,
with the results shown. Incidentally, this record belongs to Charlie
Munger, my partner for a long time in the operation of Berkshire
Hathaway. When he ran his partnership, however, his portfolio holdings
were almost completely different from mine and the other fellows
mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Table 6 is the record of a fellow who was a pal of Charlie
Munger’s—another non–business school type—who was a math major at USC.
He went to work for IBM after graduation and was an IBM salesman for a
while. After I got to Charlie, Charlie got to him. This happens to be
the record of Rick Guerin. Rick, from 1965 to 1983, against a compounded
gain of 316 percent for the SandandandandP, came off with 22,200
percent, which, probably because he lacks a business school education,
he regards as statistically significant.</p>
<p>One sidelight here: it is extraordinary to me that the idea of buying
dollar bills for 40 cents takes immediately with people or it doesn’t
take at all. It’s like an inoculation. If it doesn’t grab a person right
away, I find that you can talk to him for years and show him records,
and it doesn’t make any difference. They just don’t seem able to grasp
the concept, simple as it is. A fellow like Rick Guerin, who had no
formal education in business, understands immediately the value approach
to investing and he’s applying it five minutes later. I’ve never seen
anyone who became a gradual convert over a ten-year period to this
approach. It doesn’t seem to be a matter of IQ or academic training.
It’s instant recognition, or it is nothing.</p>
<p>Table 7 is the record of Stan Perlmeter. Stan was a liberal arts
major at the University of Michigan who was a partner in the advertising
agency of Bozell andandandand Jacobs. We happened to be in the same
building in Omaha. In 1965 he figured out I had a better business than
he did, so he left advertising. Again, it took five minutes for Stan to
embrace the value approach.</p>
<p>Perlmeter does not own what Walter Schloss owns. He does not own what
Bill Ruane owns. These are records made independently. But every time
Perlmeter buys a stock it’s because he’s getting more for his money than
he’s paying. That’s the only thing he’s thinking about. He’s not looking
at quarterly earnings projections, he’s not looking at next year’s
earnings, he’s not thinking about what day of the week it is, he doesn’t
care what investment research from any place says, he’s not interested
in price momentum, volume, or anything. He’s simply asking: What is the
business worth?</p>
<p>Table 8 and Table 9 are the records of two pension funds I’ve been
involved in. They are not selected from dozens of pension funds with
which I have had involvement; they are the only two I have influenced.
In both cases I have steered them toward value-oriented managers. Very,
very few pension funds are managed from a value standpoint. Table 8 is
the Washington Post Company’s Pension Fund. It was with a large bank
some years ago, and I suggested that they would do well to select
managers who had a value orientation.</p>
<p>As you can see, overall they have been in the top percentile ever
since they made the change. The Post told the managers to keep at least
25 percent of these funds in bonds, which would not have been
necessarily the choice of these managers. So I’ve included the bond
performance simply to illustrate that this group has no particular
expertise about bonds. They wouldn’t have said they did. Even with this
drag of 25 percent of their fund in an area that was not their game,
they were in the top percentile of fund management. The Washington Post
experience does not cover a terribly long period but it does represent
many investment decisions by three managers who were not identified
retroactively.</p>
<p>Table 9 is the record of the FMC Corporation fund. I don’t manage a
dime of it myself but I did, in 1974, influence their decision to select
value-oriented managers. Prior to that time they had selected managers
much the same way as most larger companies. They now rank number one in
the Becker survey of pension funds for their size over the period of
time subsequent to this “conversion” to the value approach. Last year
they had eight equity managers of any duration beyond a year. Seven of
them had a cumulative record better than the SandandandandP. All eight
had a better record last year than the SandandandandP. The net
difference now between a median performance and the actual performance
of the FMC fund over this period is 43 million. FMC attributes this to
the mindset given to them about the selection of managers. Those
managers are not the managers I would necessarily select but they have
the common denominator of selecting securities based on value.</p>
<p>So these are nine records of “coin-flippers” from
Graham-and-Doddsville. I haven’t selected them with hindsight from among
thousands. It’s not like I am reciting to you the names of a bunch of
lottery winners—people I had never heard of before they won the lottery.
I selected these men years ago based upon their framework for investment
decision-making. I knew what they had been taught and additionally I had
some personal knowledge of their intellect, character, and temperament.
It’s very important to understand that this group has assumed far less
risk than average; note their record in years when the general market
was weak. While they differ greatly in style, these investors are,
mentally, always buying the business, not buying the stock. A few of
them sometimes buy whole businesses. Far more often they simply buy
small pieces of businesses. Their attitude, whether buying all or a tiny
piece of a business, is the same. Some of them hold portfolios with
dozens of stocks; others concentrate on a handful. But all exploit the
difference between the market price of a business and its intrinsic
value.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that there is much inefficiency in the market. These
Graham-and-Doddsville investors have successfully exploited gaps between
price and value. When the price of a stock can be influenced by a “herd”
on Wall Street with prices set at the margin by the most emotional
person, or the greediest person, or the most depressed person, it is
hard to argue that the market always prices rationally. In fact, market
prices are frequently nonsensical.</p>
<p>I would like to say one important thing about risk and reward.
Sometimes risk and reward are correlated in a positive fashion. If
someone were to say to me, “I have here a six-shooter and I have slipped
one cartridge into it. Why don’t you just spin it and pull it once? If
you survive, I will give you million.” I would decline—perhaps stating
that million is not enough. Then he might offer me million to pull the
trigger twice—now that would be a positive correlation between risk and
reward!</p>
<p>The exact opposite is true with value investing. If you buy a dollar
bill for 60 cents, it’s riskier than if you buy a dollar bill for 40
cents, but the expectation of reward is greater in the latter case. The
greater the potential for reward in the value portfolio, the less risk
there is.</p>
<p>One quick example: The Washington Post Company in 1973 was selling
for 0 million in the market. At the time, that day, you could have sold
the assets to any one of ten buyers for not less than 00 million,
probably appreciably more. The company owned the Post, Newsweek, plus
several television stations in major markets. Those same properties are
worth billion now, so the person who would have paid 00 million would
not have been crazy.</p>
<p>Now, if the stock had declined even further to a price that made the
valuation 0 million instead of 0 million, its beta would have been
greater. And to people who think beta measures risk, the cheaper price
would have made it look riskier. This is truly Alice in Wonderland. I
have never been able to figure out why it’s riskier to buy 00 million
worth of properties for 0 million than 0 million. And, as a matter of
fact, if you buy a group of such securities and you know anything at all
about business valuation, there is essentially no risk in buying 00
million for 0 million, particularly if you do it by buying ten 0 million
piles for million each. Since you don’t have your hands on the 00
million, you want to be sure you are in with honest and reasonably
competent people, but that’s not a difficult job.</p>
<p>You also have to have the knowledge to enable you to make a very
general estimate about the value of the underlying businesses. But you
do not cut it close. That is what Ben Graham meant by having a margin of
safety. You don’t try and buy businesses worth 3 million for 0 million.
You leave yourself an enormous margin. When you build a bridge, you
insist it can carry 30,000 pounds, but you only drive 10,000-pound
trucks across it. And that same principle works in investing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, some of the more commercially minded among you may
wonder why I am writing this article. Adding many converts to the value
approach will perforce narrow the spreads between price and value. I can
only tell you that the secret has been out for 50 years, ever since Ben
Graham and Dave Dodd wrote Security Analysis, yet I have seen no trend
toward value investing in the 35 years that I’ve practiced it. There
seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy
things difficult. The academic world, if anything, has actually backed
away from the teaching of value investing over the last 30 years. It’s
likely to continue that way. Ships will sail around the world but the
Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide
discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace, and those who
read their Graham andandandand Dodd will continue to prosper.</p>

<li>Important Rules Concerning Taxability of Investment Income and
Security Transactions (in 1972)</li>
</ol>
<p>Editor’s note: Due to extensive changes in the rules governing such
transactions, the following document is presented here for historical
purposes only. When first written by Benjamin Graham in 1972, all the
information therein was correct. However, intervening developments have
rendered this document inaccurate for today’s purposes. Following
Graham’s original Appendix 2 is a revised and updated version of “The
Basics of Investment Taxation,” which brings the reader up-to-date on
the relevant rules.</p>
<p>Rule 1—Interest and Dividends</p>
<p>Interest and dividends are taxable as ordinary income except (a)
income received from state, municipal, and similar obligations, which
are free from Federal tax but may be subject to state tax, (b) dividends
representing a return of capital, (c) certain dividends paid by
investment companies (see below), and (d) the first 00 of ordinary
domestic-corporation dividends.</p>
<p>Rule 2—Capital Gains and Losses</p>
<p>Short-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net
short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and losses are
merged to obtain the net long-term capital gain or loss. If the net
short-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss, 100 per
cent of such excess shall be included in income. The maximum tax thereon
is 25% up to 0,000 of such gains and 35% on the balance.</p>
<p>A net capital loss (the amount exceeding capital gains) is deductible
from ordinary income to a maximum of ,000 in the current year and in
each of the next five years. Alternatively, unused losses may be applied
at any time to offset capital gains. (Carry-overs of losses taken before
1970 are treated more liberally than later losses.)</p>
<p>Note Concerning “Regulated Investment Companies”</p>
<p>Most investment funds (“investment companies”) take advantage of
special provisions of the tax law, which enable them to be taxed
substantially as partnerships. Thus if they make long-term security
profits they can distribute these as “capital-gain dividends,” which are
reported by their shareholders in the same way as long-term gains. These
carry a lower tax rate than ordinary dividends. Alternatively, such a
company may elect to pay the 25% tax for the account of its shareholders
and then retain the balance of the capital gains without distributing
them as capital-gain dividends.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Basics of Investment Taxation (Updated as of 2003)</li>
</ol>
<p>Interest and Dividends</p>
<p>Interest and dividends are taxed at your ordinary-income tax rate
except (a) interest received from municipal bonds, which is free from
Federal income tax but may be subject to state tax, (b) dividends
representing a return of capital, and (c) long-term capital-gain
distributions paid by mutual funds (see below). Private-activity
municipal bonds, even within a mutual fund, may subject you to the
Federal alternative minimum tax.</p>
<p>Capital Gains and Losses</p>
<p>Short-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net
short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and losses are
merged to determine your net long-term capital gain or loss. If your net
short-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss, that
excess is counted as ordinary income. If there is a net long-term
capital gain, it is taxed at the favorable capital gains rate, generally
20%—which will fall to 18% for investments purchased after December 31,
2000, and held for more than five years.</p>
<p>A net capital loss is deductible from ordinary income to a maximum of
,000 in the current year. Any capital losses in excess of ,000 may be
applied in later tax years to offset future capital gains.</p>
<p>Mutual Funds</p>
<p>As “regulated investment companies,” nearly all mutual funds take
advantage of special provisions of the tax law that exempt them from
corporate income tax. After selling long-term holdings, mutual funds can
distribute the profits as “capital-gain dividends,” which their
shareholders treat as long-term gains. These are taxed at a lower rate
(generally 20%) than ordinary dividends (up to 39%). You should
generally avoid making large new investments during the fourth quarter
of each year, when these capital-gain distributions are usually
distributed; otherwise you will incur tax for a gain earned by the fund
before you even owned it.</p>

<li>The New Speculation in Common Stocks1</li>
</ol>
<p>What I shall have to say will reflect the spending of many years in
Wall Street, with their attendant varieties of experience. This has
included the recurrent advent of new conditions, or a new atmosphere,
which challenge the value of experience itself. It is true that one of
the elements that distinguish economics, finance, and security analysis
from other practical disciplines is the uncertain validity of past
phenomena as a guide to the present and future. Yet we have no right to
reject the lessons of the past until we have at least studied and
understood them. My address today is an effort toward such understanding
in a limited field—in particular, an endeavor to point out some
contrasting relationships between the present and the past in our
underlying attitudes toward investment and speculation in common
stocks.</p>
<p>Let me start with a summary of my thesis. In the past the speculative
elements of a common stock resided almost exclusively in the company
itself; they were due to uncertainties, or fluctuating elements, or
downright weaknesses in the industry, or the corporation’s individual
setup. These elements of speculation still exist, of course; but it may
be said that they have been sensibly diminished by a number of long-term
developments to which I shall refer. But in revenge a new and major
element of speculation has been introduced into the common-stock arena
from outside the companies. It comes from the attitude and viewpoint of
the stock-buying public and their advisers—chiefly us security analysts.
This attitude may be described in a phrase: primary emphasis upon future
expectations.</p>
<p>Nothing will appear more logical and natural to this audience than
the idea that a common stock should be valued and priced primarily on
the basis of the company’s expected future performance. Yet this
simple-appearing concept carries with it a number of paradoxes and
pitfalls. For one thing, it obliterates a good part of the older,
well-established distinctions between investment and speculation. The
dictionary says that “speculate” comes from the Latin “specula,” a
lookout. Thus it was the speculator who looked out and saw future
developments coming before other people did. But today, if the investor
is shrewd or well advised, he too must have his lookout on the future,
or rather he mounts into a common lookout where he rubs elbows with the
speculator.</p>
<p>Secondly, we find that, for the most part, companies with the best
investment characteristics—i.e., the best credit rating—are the ones
which are likely to attract the largest speculative interest in their
common stocks, since everyone assumes they are guaranteed a brilliant
future. Thirdly, the concept of future prospects, and particularly of
continued growth in the future, invites the application of formulas out
of higher mathematics to establish the present value of the favored
issues. But the combination of precise formulas with highly imprecise
assumptions can be used to establish, or rather to justify, practically
any value one wishes, however high, for a really outstanding issue. But,
paradoxically, that very fact on close examination will be seen to imply
that no one value, or reasonably narrow range of values, can be counted
on to establish and maintain itself for a given growth company; hence at
times the market may conceivably value the growth component at a
strikingly low figure.</p>
<p>Returning to my distinction between the older and newer speculative
elements in common stock, we might characterize them by two outlandish
but convenient words, viz.: endogenous and exogenous. Let me illustrate
briefly the old-time speculative common stock, as distinguished from an
investment stock, by some data relating to American Can and Pennsylvania
Railroad in 1911–1913. (These appear in Benjamin Graham and David L.
Dodd, Security Analysis, McGraw-Hill, 1940, pp. 2–3.)</p>
<p>In those three years the price range of “Pennsy” moved only between
53 and 65, or between 12.2 and 15 times its average earnings for the
period. It showed steady profits, was paying a reliable dividend, and
investors were sure that it was backed by wellover its par of 0 in
tangible assets. By contrast, the price of American Can ranged between 9
and 47; its earnings between 7 cents and .86; the ratio of price to the
three-year average earnings moved between 1.9 times and 10 times; it
paid no dividend at all; and sophisticated investors were well aware
that the 00 par value of the common represented nothing but undisclosed
“water,” since the preferred issue exceeded the tangible assets
available for it. Thus American Can common was a representative
speculative issue, because American Can Company was then a speculatively
capitalized enterprise in a fluctuating and uncertain industry.
Actually, American Can had a far more brilliant long-term future than
Pennsylvania Railroad; but not only was this fact not suspected by
investors or speculators in those days, but even if it had been it would
probably have been put aside by the investors as basically irrelevant to
investment policies and programs in the years 1911–1913.</p>
<p>Now, to expose you to the development through time of the importance
of long-term prospects for investments. I should like to use as my
example our most spectacular giant industrial enterprise—none other than
International Business Machines, which last year entered the small group
of companies with billion of sales. May I introduce one or two
autobiographical notes here, in order to inject a little of the personal
touch into what otherwise would be an excursion into cold figures? In
1912 I had left college for a term to take charge of a research project
for U.S. Express Company. We set out to find the effect on revenues of a
proposed revolutionary new system of computing express rates. For this
purpose we used the so-called Hollerith machines, leased out by the then
Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. They comprised card punches,
card sorters, and tabulators—tools almost unknown to businessmen, then,
and having their chief application in the Census Bureau. I entered Wall
Street in 1914, and the next year the bonds and common stock of C.-T.-R.
Company were listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Well, I had a kind
of sentimental interest in that enterprise, and besides I considered
myself a sort of technological expert on their products, being one of
the few financial people who had seen and used them. So early in 1916 I
went to the head of my firm, known as Mr. A. N., and pointed out to him
that C.-T.-R. stock was selling in the middle 40s (for 105,000 shares);
that it had earned .50 in 1915; that its book value— including, to be
sure, some nonsegregated intangibles—was 30; that it had started a
dividend; and that I thought rather highly of the company’s products and
prospects. Mr. A. N. looked at me pityingly. “Ben,” said he, “do not
mention that company to me again. I would not touch it with a ten-foot
pole. 〔His favorite expression.〕 Its 6 per cent bonds are selling in
the low 80s and they are no good. So how can the stock be any good?
Everybody knows there is nothing behind it but water.” (Glossary: In
those days that was the ultimate of condemnation. It meant that the
asset account of the balance sheet was fictitious. Many industrial
companies—notably U.S. Steel—despite their 00 par, represented nothing
but water, concealed in a written-up plant account. Since they had
“nothing” to back them but earning power and future prospects, no
self-respecting investor would give them a second thought.)</p>
<p>I returned to my statistician’s cubbyhole, a chastened young man.
Mr. A. N. was not only experienced and successful, but extremely shrewd
as well. So much was I impressed by his sweeping condemnation of
Computing-Tabulating-Recording that I never bought a share of it in my
life, not even after its name was changed to International Business
Machines in 1926.</p>
<p>Now let us take a look at the same company with its new name in 1926,
a year of pretty high stock markets. At that time it first revealed the
good-will item in its balance sheet, in the rather large sum of 3.6
million. A. N. had been right. Practically every dollar of the so-called
equity behind the common in 1915 had been nothing but water. However,
since that time the company had made an impressive record under the
direction of T. L. Watson, Sr. Its net had risen from 91,000 to .7
million—over fivefold—a greater percentage gain than it was to make in
any subsequent eleven-year period. It had built up a nice tangible
equity for the common, and had split it 3.6 for one. It had established
a dividend rate for the new stock, while earnings were .39 thereon. You
might have expected the 1926 stock market to have been pretty
enthusiastic about a company with such a growth history and so strong a
trade position. Let us see. The price range for that year was 31 low, 59
high. At the average of 45 it was selling at the same 7-times multiplier
of earnings and the same 6.7 per cent dividend yield as it had done in
1915. At its low of 31 it was not far in excess of its tangible book
value, and in that respect was far more conservatively priced than
eleven years earlier.</p>
<p>These data illustrate, as well as any can, the persistence of the
old-time investment viewpoint until the culminating years of the bull
market of the 1920s. What has happened since then can be summarized by
using ten-year intervals in the history of IBM. In 1936 net expanded to
twice the 1926 figures, and the average multiplier rose from 7 to 17½.
From 1936 to 1946 the gain was 2½ times, but the average multiplier in
1946 remained at 17½. Then the pace accelerated. The 1956 net was nearly
4 times that of 1946, and the average multiplier rose to 32½. Last year,
with a further gain in net, the multiplier rose again to an average of
42, if we do not count the unconsolidated equity in the foreign
subsidiary.</p>
<p>When we examine these recent price figures with care we see some
interesting analogies and contrasts with those of forty years earlier.
The one-time scandalous water, so prevalent in the balance sheets of
industrial companies, has all been squeezed out—first by disclosure and
then by writeoffs. But a different kind of water has been put back into
the valuation by the stock market—by investors and speculators
themselves. When IBM now sells at 7 times its book value, instead of 7
times earnings, the effect is practically the same as if it had no book
value at all. Or the small book-value portion can be considered as a
sort of minor preferred-stock component of the price, the rest
representing exactly the same sort of commitment as the old-time
speculator made when he bought Woolworth or U.S. Steel common entirely
for their earning power and future prospects.</p>
<p>It is worth remarking, in passing, that in the thirty years which saw
IBM transformed from a 7-times earnings to a 40-times earnings
enterprise, many of what I have called the endogenous speculative
aspects of our large industrial companies have tended to disappear, or
at least to diminish greatly. Their financial positions are firm, their
capital structures conservative: they are managed far more expertly, and
even more honestly, than before. Furthermore, the requirements of
complete disclosure have removed one of the important speculative
elements of years ago—that derived from ignorance and mystery.</p>
<p>Another personal digression here. In my early years in the Street one
of the favorite mystery stocks was Consolidated Gas of New York, now
Consolidated Edison. It owned as a subsidiary the profitable New York
Edison Company, but it reported only dividends received from this
source, not its full earnings. The unreported Edison earnings supplied
the mystery and the “hidden value.” To my surprise I discovered that
these hush-hush figures were actually on file each year with the Public
Service Commission of the state. It was a simple matter to consult the
records and to present the true earnings of Consolidated Gas in a
magazine article. (Incidentally, the addition to profits was not
spectacular.) One of my older friends said to me then: “Ben, you may
think you are a great guy to supply those missing figures, but Wall
Street is going to thank you for nothing. Consolidated Gas with the
mystery is both more interesting and more valuable than ex-mystery. You
youngsters who want to stick your noses into everything are going to
ruin Wall Street.”</p>
<p>It is true that the three M’s which then supplied so much fuel to the
speculative fires have now all but disappeared. These were Mystery,
Manipulation, and (thin) Margins. But we security analysts have
ourselves been creating valuation approaches which are so speculative in
themselves as to pretty well take the place of those older speculative
factors. Do we not have our own “3M’s” now—none other than Minnesota
Mining and Manufacturing Company—and does not this common stock
illustrate perfectly the new speculation as contrasted with the old?
Consider a few figures. When M. M. andandandand M. common sold at 101
last year the market was valuing it at 44 times 1956 earnings, which
happened to show no increase to speak of in 1957. The enterprise itself
was valued at .7 billion, of which 00 million was covered by net assets,
and a cool ½ billion represented the market’s appraisal of “good will.”
We do not know the process of calculation by which that valuation of
good will was arrived at; we do know that a few months later the market
revised this appraisal downward by some 50 million, or about 30 per
cent. Obviously it is impossible to calculate accurately the intangible
component of a splendid company such as this. It follows as a kind of
mathematical law that the more important the good will or future
earning-power factor the more uncertain becomes the true value of the
enterprise, and therefore the more speculative inherently the common
stock.</p>
<p>It may be well to recognize a vital difference that has developed in
the valuation of these intangible factors, when we compare earlier times
with today. A generation or more ago it was the standard rule,
recognized both in average stock prices and in formal or legal
valuations, that intangibles were to be appraised on a more conservative
basis than tangibles. A good industrial company might be required to
earn between 6 per cent and 8 per cent on its tangible assets,
represented typically by bonds and preferred stock; but its excess
earnings, or the intangible assets they gave rise to, would be valued
on, say, a 15 per cent basis. (You will find approximately these ratios
in the initial offering of Woolworth preferred and common stock in 1911,
and in numerous others.) But what has happened since the 1920s?
Essentially the exact reverse of these relationships may now be seen. A
company must now typically earn about 10 per cent on its common equity
to have it sell in the average market at full book value. But its excess
earnings, above 10 per cent on capital, are usually valued more
liberally, or at a higher multiplier, than the base earnings required to
support the book value in the market. Thus a company earning 15 per cent
on the equity may well sell at 13½ times earnings, or twice its net
assets. This would mean that the first 10 per cent earned on capital is
valued at only 10 times, but the next 5 per cent—what used to be called
the “excess”—is actually valued at 20 times.</p>
<p>Now there is a logical reason for this reversal in valuation
procedure, which is related to the newer emphasis on growth
expectations. Companies that earn a high return on capital are given
these liberal appraisals not only because of the good profitability
itself, and the relative stability associated with it, but perhaps even
more cogently because high earnings on capital generally go hand in hand
with a good growth record and prospects. Thus what is really paid for
nowadays in the case of highly profitable companies is not the good will
in the old and restricted sense of an established name and a profitable
business, but rather their assumed superior expectations of increased
profits in the future.</p>
<p>This brings me to one or two additional mathematical aspects of the
new attitude toward common-stock valuations, which I shall touch on
merely in the form of brief suggestions. If, as many tests show, the
earnings multiplier tends to increase with profitability—i.e., as the
rate of return on book value increases—then the arithmetical consequence
of this feature is that value tends to increase directly as the square
of the earnings, but inversely the book value. Thus in an important and
very real sense tangible assets have become a drag on average market
value rather than a source thereof. Take a far from extreme
illustration. If Company A earns a share on a 0 book value, and Company
B also a share on 00 book value, Company A is almost certain to sell at
a higher multiplier, and hence at higher price than Company B—say 0 for
Company A shares and 5 for Company B shares. Thus it would not be
inexact to declare that the 0 per share of greater assets for Company B
are responsible for the 5 per share lower market price, since the
earnings per share are assumed to be equal.</p>
<p>But more important than the foregoing is the general relationship
between mathematics and the new approach to stock values. Given the
three ingredients of (a) optimistic assumptions as to the rate of
earnings growth, (b) a sufficiently long projection of this growth into
the future, and (c) the miraculous workings of compound interest—lo! the
security analyst is supplied with a new kind of philosopher’s stone
which can produce or justify any desired valuation for a really “good
stock.” I have commented in a recent article in the Analysts’ Journal on
the vogue of higher mathematics in bull markets, and quoted David
Durand’s exposition of the striking analogy between value calculations
of growth stocks and the famous Petersburg Paradox, which has challenged
and confused mathematicians for more than two hundred years. The point I
want to make here is that there is a special paradox in the relationship
between mathematics and investment attitudes on common stocks, which is
this: Mathematics is ordinarily considered as producing precise and
dependable results; but in the stock market the more elaborate and
abstruse the mathematics the more uncertain and speculative are the
conclusions we draw therefrom. In forty-four years of Wall Street
experience and study I have never seen dependable calculations made
about common-stock values, or related investment policies, that went
beyond simple arithmetic or the most elementary algebra. Whenever
calculus is brought in, or higher algebra, you could take it as a
warning signal that the operator was trying to substitute theory for
experience, and usually also to give to speculation the deceptive guise
of investment.</p>
<p>The older ideas of common-stock investment may seem quite naïve to
the sophisticated security analyst of today. The great emphasis was
always on what we now call the defensive aspects of the company or
issue—mainly the assurance that it would continue its dividend unreduced
in bad times. Thus the strong railroads, which constituted the standard
investment commons of fifty years ago, were actually regarded in very
much the same way as the public-utility commons in recent years. If the
past record indicated stability, the chief requirement was met; not too
much effort was made to anticipate adverse changes of an underlying
character in the future. But, conversely, especially favorable future
prospects were regarded by shrewd investors as something to look for but
not to pay for.</p>
<p>In effect this meant that the investor did not have to pay anything
substantial for superior long-term prospects. He got these, virtually
without extra cost, as a reward for his own superior intelligence and
judgment in picking the best rather than the merely good companies. For
common stocks with the same financial strength, past earnings record,
and dividend stability all sold at about the same dividend yield.</p>
<p>This was indeed a shortsighted point of view, but it had the great
advantage of making common-stock investment in the old days not only
simple but also basically sound and highly profitable. Let me return for
the last time to a personal note. Somewhere around 1920 our firm
distributed a series of little pamphlets entitled Lessons for Investors.
Of course it took a brash analyst in his middle twenties like myself to
hit on so smug and presumptuous a title. But in one of the papers I made
the casual statement that “if a common stock is a good investment it is
also a good speculation.” For, reasoned I, if a common stock was so
sound that it carried very little risk of loss it must ordinarily be so
good as to possess excellent chances for future gains. Now this was a
perfectly true and even valuable discovery, but it was true only because
nobody paid any attention to it. Some years later, when the public woke
up to the historical merits of common stocks as long-term investments,
they soon ceased to have any such merit, because the public’s enthusiasm
created price levels which deprived them of their builtin margin of
safety, and thus drove them out of the investment class. Then, of
course, the pendulum swung to the other extreme, and we soon saw one of
the most respected authorities declaring (in 1931) that no common stock
could ever be an investment.</p>
<p>When we view this long-range experience in perspective we find
another set of paradoxes in the investor’s changing attitude toward
capital gains as contrasted with income. It seems a truism to say that
the old-time common-stock investor was not much interested in capital
gains. He bought almost entirely for safety and income, and let the
speculator concern himself with price appreciation. Today we are likely
to say that the more experienced and shrewd the investor, the less
attention he pays to dividend returns, and the more heavily his interest
centers on long-term appreciation. Yet one might argue, perversely, that
precisely because the old-time investor did not concentrate on future
capital appreciation he was virtually guaranteeing to himself that he
would have it, at least in the field of industrial stocks. And,
conversely, today’s investor is so concerned with anticipating the
future that he is already paying handsomely for it in advance. Thus what
he has projected with so much study and care may actually happen and
still not bring him any profit. If it should fail to materialize to the
degree expected he may in fact be faced with a serious temporary and
perhaps even permanent loss.</p>
<p>What lessons—again using the pretentious title of my 1920
pamphlet—can the analyst of 1958 learn from this linking of past with
current attitudes? Not much of value, one is inclined to say. We can
look back nostalgically to the good old days when we paid only for the
present and could get the future for nothing—an “all this and Heaven
too” combination. Shaking our heads sadly we mutter, “Those days are
gone forever.” Have not investors and security analysts eaten of the
tree of knowledge of good and evil prospects? By so doing have they not
permanently expelled themselves from that Eden where promising common
stocks at reasonable prices could be plucked off the bushes? Are we
doomed always to run the risk either of paying unreasonably high prices
for good quality and prospects, or of getting poor quality and prospects
when we pay what seems a reasonable price?</p>
<p>It certainly looks that way. Yet one cannot be sure even of that
pessimistic dilemma. Recently, I did a little research in the long-term
history of that towering enterprise, General Electric—stimulated by the
arresting chart of fifty-nine years of earnings and dividends appearing
in their recently published 1957 Report. These figures are not without
their surprises for the knowledgeable analyst. For one thing they show
that prior to 1947 the growth of G. E. was fairly modest and quite
irregular. The 1946 earnings, per share adjusted, were only 30 per cent
higher than in 1902—52 cents versus 40 cents—and in no year of this
period were the 1902 earnings as much as doubled. Yet the price-earnings
ratio rose from 9 times in 1910 and 1916 to 29 times in 1936 and again
in 1946. One might say, of course, that the 1946 multiplier at least
showed the well-known prescience of shrewd investors. We analysts were
able to foresee then the really brilliant period of growth that was
looming ahead in the next decade. Maybe so. But some of you remember
that the next year, 1947, which established an impressive new high for
G.E.’s per-share earnings, was marked also by an extraordinary fall in
the price-earnings ratio. At its low of 32 (before the 3-for-1 split)
G.E. actually sold again at only 9 times its current earnings and its
average price for the year was only about 10 times earnings. Our crystal
ball certainly clouded over in the short space of twelve months.</p>
<p>This striking reversal took place only eleven years ago. It casts
some little doubt in my mind as to the complete dependability of the
popular belief among analysts that prominent and promising companies
will now always sell at high price-earnings ratios—that this is a
fundamental fact of life for investors and they may as well accept and
like it. I have no desire at all to be dogmatic on this point. All I can
say is that it is not settled in my mind, and each of you must seek to
settle it for yourself.</p>
<p>But in my concluding remarks I can say something definite about the
structure of the market for various types of common stocks, in terms of
their investment and speculative characteristics. In the old days the
investment character of a common stock was more or less the same as, or
proportionate with, that of the enterprise itself, as measured quite
well by its credit rating. The lower the yield on its bonds or
preferred, the more likely was the common to meet all the criteria for a
satisfactory investment, and the smaller the element of speculation
involved in its purchase. This relationship, between the speculative
ranking of the common and the investment rating of the company, could be
graphically expressed pretty much as a straight line descending from
left to right. But nowadays I would describe the graph as U-shaped. At
the left, where the company itself is speculative and its credit low,
the common stock is of course highly speculative, just as it has always
been in the past. At the right extremity, however, where the company has
the highest credit rating because both its past record and future
prospects are most impressive, we find that the stock market tends more
or less continuously to introduce a highly speculative element into the
common shares through the simple means of a price so high as to carry a
fair degree of risk.</p>
<p>At this point I cannot forbear introducing a surprisingly relevant,
if quite exaggerated, quotation on the subject which I found recently in
one of Shakespeare’s sonnets. It reads:</p>
<p>Have I not seen dwellers on form and favor</p>
<p>Lose all and more by paying too much rent?</p>
<p>Returning to my imaginary graph, it would be the center area where
the speculative element in common-stock purchases would tend to reach
its minimum. In this area we could find many well-established and strong
companies, with a record of past growth corresponding to that of the
national economy and with future prospects apparently of the same
character. Such common stocks could be bought at most times, except in
the upper ranges of a bull market, at moderate prices in relation to
their indicated intrinsic values. As a matter of fact, because of the
present tendency of investors and speculators alike to concentrate on
more glamorous issues, I should hazard the statement that these
middle-ground stocks tend to sell on the whole rather below their
independently determinable values. They thus have a margin-of-safety
factor supplied by the same market preferences and prejudices which tend
to destroy the margin of safety in the more promising issues.
Furthermore, in this wide array of companies there is plenty of room for
penetrating analysis of the past record and for discriminating choice in
the area of future prospects, to which can be added the higher assurance
of safety conferred by diversification.</p>
<p>When Phaëthon insisted on driving the chariot of the Sun, his father,
the experienced operator, gave the neophyte some advice which the latter
failed to follow—to his cost. Ovid summed up Phoebus Apollo’s counsel in
three words:</p>
<p>Medius tutissimus ibis</p>
<p>You will go safest in the middle course</p>
<p>I think this principle holds good for investors and their security
analyst advisers.</p>

<li>A Case History: Aetna Maintenance Co.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first part of this history is reproduced from our 1965 edition,
where it appeared under the title “A Horrible Example.” The second part
summarizes the later metamorphosis of the enterprise.</p>
<p>We think it might have a salutary effect on our readers’ future
attitude toward new common-stock offerings if we cited one “horrible
example” here in some detail. It is taken from the first page of
Standard andandandand Poor’s Stock Guide, and illustrates in extreme
fashion the glaring weaknesses of the 1960–1962 flotations, the
extraordinary overvaluations given them in the market, and the
subsequent collapse.</p>
<p>In November 1961, 154,000 shares of Aetna Maintenance Co. common were
sold to public at and the price promptly advanced to 5. Before the
financing the net assets per share were about .20, but they were
increased to slightly over per share by the money received for the new
shares.</p>
<p>The sales and earnings prior to the financing were:</p>
<p>The corresponding figures after the financing were:</p>
<p>June 1963 ,681,000 2,000 (def.) 1.sh.11 (def.)</p>
<p>June 1962 4,234,000 149,000 0.36</p>
<p>In 1962 the price fell to 2 2/3, and in 1964 it sold as low as 7/8.
No dividends were paid during this period.</p>
<p>COMMENT: This was much too small a business for public participation.
The stock was sold—and bought—on the basis of one good year; the results
previously had been derisory. There was nothing in the nature of this
highly competitive business to insure future stability. At the high
price soon after issuance the heedless public was paying much more per
dollar of earnings and assets than for most of our large and strong
companies. This example is admittedly extreme, but it is far from
unique; the instances of lesser, but inexcusable, overvaluations run
into the hundreds.</p>
<p>Sequel 1965–1970</p>
<p>In 1965 new interests came into the company. The unprofitable
building-maintenance business was sold out, and the company embarked in
an entirely different venture: making electronic devices. The name was
changed to Haydon Switch and Instrument Co. The earnings results have
not been impressive. In the five years 1965–1969 the enterprise showed
average earnings of only 8 cents per share of “old stock,” with 34 cents
earned in the best year, 1967. However, in true modern style, the
company split the stock 2 for 1 in 1968. The market price also ran true
to Wall Street form. It advanced from 7/8 in 1964 to the equivalent of
16½ in 1968 (after the split). The price now exceeded the record set in
the enthusiastic days of 1961. This time the overvaluation was much
worse than before. The stock was now selling at 52 times the earnings of
its only good year, and some 200 times its average earnings. Also, the
company was again to report a deficit in the very year that the new high
price was established. The next year, 1969, the bid price fell to .</p>
<p>QUESTIONS: Did the idiots who paid + for this stock in 1968 know
anything at all about the company’s previous history, its five-year
earnings record, its asset value (very small)? Did they have any idea of
how much—or rather how little—they were getting for their money? Did
they care? Has anyone on Wall Street any responsibility at all for the
regular recurrence of completely brainless, shockingly widespread, and
inevitable catastrophic speculation in this kind of vehicle?</p>

<li><p>Tax Accounting for NVF’s Acquisition of Sharon Steel
Shares</p></li>
<li><p>NVF acquired 88% of Sharon stock in 1969, paying for each share 0
in NVF 5% bonds, due 1994, and warrants to buy 1½ shares of NVF at 2 per
share. The initial market value of the bonds appears to have been only
43% of par, while the warrants were quoted at 0 per NVF share involved.
This meant that the Sharon holders got only 0 worth of bonds but 5 worth
of warrants for each share turned in, a total of 5 per share. (This was
about the average price of Sharon in 1968, and also its closing price
for the year.) The book value of Sharon was 0 per share. The difference
between this book value and the market value of Sharon stock amounted to
about 1 million on the 1,415,000 shares of Sharon acquired.</p></li>
<li><p>The accounting treatment was designed to accomplish three things:
(a) To treat the issuance of the bonds as equivalent to a “sale” thereof
at 43, giving the company an annual deduction from income for
amortization of the huge bond discount of 4 million. (Actually it would
be charging itself about 15% annual interest on the “proceeds” of the 9
million debenture issue.) (b) To offset this bond-discount charge by an
approximately equal “profit,” consisting of a credit to income of
one-tenth of the difference between the cost price of 45 for the Sharon
stock and its book value of 60. (This would correspond, in reverse
fashion, to the required practice of charging income each year with a
part of the price paid for acquisitions in excess of the book value of
the assets acquired.) (c) The beauty of this arrangement would be that
the company could save initially about 00,000 a year, or per share, in
income taxes from these two annual entries, because the amortization of
bond discount could be deducted from taxable income but the amortization
of “excess of equity over cost” did not have to be included in taxable
income.</p></li>
<li><p>This accounting treatment is reflected in both the consolidated
income account and the consolidated balance sheet of NVF for 1969, and
pro forma for 1968. Since a good part of the cost of Sharon stock was to
be treated as paid for by warrants, it was necessary to show the initial
market value of the warrants as part of the common-stock capital figure.
Thus in this case, as in no other that we know, the warrants were
assigned a substantial value in the balance sheet, namely 2 million+
(but only in an explanatory note).</p></li>
<li><p>Technological Companies as Investments</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the Standard andandandand Poor’s services in mid-1971 there were
listed about 200 companies with names beginning with Compu-, Data,
Electro-, Scien-, Techno-. About half of these belonged to some part of
the computer industry. All of them were traded in the market or had made
applications to sell stock to the public.</p>
<p>A total of 46 such companies appeared in the S andandandand P Stock
Guide for September 1971. Of these, 26 were reporting deficits, only six
were earning over per share, and only five were paying dividends.</p>
<p>In the December 1968 Stock Guide there had appeared 45 companies with
similar technological names. Tracing the sequel of this list, as shown
in the September 1971 Guide, we find the following developments:</p>
<p>COMMENT: It is virtually certain that the many technological
companies not included in the Guide in 1968 had a poorer subsequent
record than those that were included; also that the 12 companies dropped
from the list did worse than those that were retained. The harrowing
results shown by these samples are no doubt reasonably indicative of the
quality and price history of the entire group of “technology” issues.
The phenomenal success of IBM and a few other companies was bound to
produce a spate of public offerings of new issues in their fields, for
which large losses were virtually guaranteed.</p>

<li><p>In current mathematical approaches to investment decisions, it
has become standard practice to define “risk” in terms of average price
variations or “volatility.” See, for example, by Richard A. Brealey, The
M.I.T. Press, 1969. We find this use of the word “risk” more harmful
than useful for sound investment decisions—because it places too much

<li><p>All 30 companies in the DJIA met this standard in 1971.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Chapter 6. Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative
Approach</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In 1970 the Milwaukee road reported a large deficit. It suspended
interest payments on its income bonds, and the price of the 5% issue
fell to 10.</p></li>
<li><p>For example: Cities Service first preferred, not paying
dividends, sold at as low as 15 in 1937 and at 27 in 1943, when the
accumulations had reached 0 per share. In 1947 it was retired by
exchange for 96.50 of 3% debentures for each share, and it sold as high
as 186.</p></li>
<li><p>An elaborate statistical study carried on under the direction of
the National Bureau of Economic Research indicates that such has
actually been the case. Graham is referring to W. Braddock Hickman,
Corporate Bond Quality and Investor Experience (Princeton University
Press, 1958). Hickman’s book later inspired Michael Milken of Drexel
Burnham Lambert to offer massive high-yield financing to companies with
less than sterling credit ratings, helping to ignite the leveragedbuyout
and hostile takeover craze of the late 1980s.</p></li>
<li><p>A representative sample of 41 such issues taken from Standard

<li><p>A company with an ordinary record cannot, without confusing the
term, be called a growth company or a “growth stock” merely because its
proponent expects it to do better than the average in the future. It is
just a “promising company.” Graham is making a subtle but important
point: If the definition of a growth stock is a company that will thrive
in the future, then that’s not a definition at all, but wishful
thinking. It’s like calling a sports team “the champions” before the
season is over. This wishful thinking persists today; among mutual
funds, “growth” portfolios describe their holdings as companies with
“above-average growth potential” or “favorable prospects for earnings
growth.” A better definition might be companies whose net earnings per
share have increased by an annual average of at least 15% for at least
five years running. (Meeting this definition in the past does not ensure
that a company will meet it in the future.)</p></li>

state-owned Italian electric-energy concern on its “guaranteed floating

the annual rate of interest paid thereon for the next six months would

Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds (Metro Books,
New York, 2002) was first published in 1841. Neither a light read nor
always strictly accurate, it is an extensive look at how large numbers
of people often believe very silly things—for instance, that iron can be
transmuted into gold, that demons most often show up on Friday evenings,
and that it is possible to get rich quick in the stock market. For a
more factual account, consult Edward Chancellor’s Devil Take the
Hindmost (Farrar, Straus andandandand Giroux, New York, 1999); for a

usually makes the prospectus of prohibitive length. It is generally
agreed that only a small percentage of buying new issues read the

<p>General Approach</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Our textbook, by Benjamin Graham, David L. Dodd, Sidney Cottle,
and Charles Tatham (McGraw-Hill, 4th ed., 1962), retains the title
originally chosen in 1934, but it covers much of the scope of financial
analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>With Charles McGolrick, Harper andandandand Row, 1964, reissued
by HarperBusiness, 1998.</p></li>
<li><p>These figures are from Salomon Bros., a large New York bond
house.</p></li>
<li><p>At least not by the great body of security analysts and
investors. Exceptional analysts, who can tell in advance what companies
are likely to deserve intensive study and have the facilities and
capability to make it, may have continued success with this work. For
details of such an approach see Philip Fisher, Harper andandandand Row,
1960.</p></li>
<li><p>On p. 295 we set forth a formula relating multipliers to the rate
of expected growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Part of the fireworks in the price of Chrysler was undoubtedly
inspired by two two-for-one stock splits taking place in the single year
1963—an unprecedented phenomenon for a major company. In the early
1980s, under Lee Iacocca, Chrysler did a three-peat, coming back from
the brink of bankruptcy to become one of the best-performing stocks in
America. However, identifying managers who can lead great corporate
comebacks is not as easy as it seems. When Al Dunlap took over Sunbeam
Corp. in 1996 after restructuring Scott Paper Co. (and driving its stock
price up 225% in 18 months), Wall Street hailed him as little short of
the Second Coming. Dunlap turned out to be a sham who used improper
accounting and false financial statements to mislead Sunbeam’s
investors—including the revered money managers Michael Price and Michael
Steinhardt, who had hired him. For a keen dissection of Dunlap’s career,
see John A. Byrne, Chainsaw (HarperCollins, New York, 1999).</p></li>
<li><p>Note that we do not suggest that this formula gives the “true
value” of a growth stock, but only that it approximates the results of
the more elaborate calculations in vogue.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Chapter 12. Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Our recommended method of dealing with the warrant dilution is
discussed below. We prefer to consider the market value of the warrants
as an addition to the current market price of the common stock as a
whole.</li>
</ol>
<p>Chapter 13. A Comparison of Four Listed Companies</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In March 1972, Emery sold at 64 times its 1971 earnings!</li>
</ol>
<p>Chapter 14. Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Because of numerous stock splits, etc., through the years, the
actual average price of the DJIA list was about 3 per share in early
1972.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1960 only two of the 29 industrial companies failed to show
current assets equal to twice current liabilities, and only two failed
to have net current assets exceeding their debt. By December 1970 the
number in each category had grown from two to twelve.</p></li>
<li><p>But note that their combined market action from December 1970 to
early 1972 was poorer than that of the DJIA. This demonstrates once
again that no system or formula will guarantee superior market results.
Our requirements “guarantee” only that the portfolio-buyer is getting
his money’s worth.</p></li>
<li><p>As a consequence we must exclude the majority of gas pipeline
stocks, since these enterprises are heavily bonded. The justification
for this setup is the underlying structure of purchase contracts which
“guarantee” bond payments; but the considerations here may be too
complicated for the needs of a defensive investor.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Chapter 15. Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mutual Funds and Other Institutional Investors: A New
Perspective, I. Friend, M. Blume, and J. Crockett, McGraw-Hill, 1970. We
should add that the 1966–1970 results of many of the funds we studied
were somewhat better than those of the Standard andandandand Poor’s
500-stock composite and considerably better than those of the
DJIA.</p></li>
<li><p>Personal note: Many years before the stock-market pyrotechnics in
that particular company the author was its “financial vice-president” at
the princely salary of ,000 per annum. It was then really in the
fireworks business. In early 1929, Graham became a financial vice
president of Unexcelled Manufacturing Co., the nation’s largest producer
of fireworks. Unexcelled later became a diversified chemical company and
no longer exists in independent form.</p></li>
<li><p>The Guide does not show multipliers above 99. Most such would be
mathematical oddities, caused by earnings just above the zero
point.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Chapter 16. Convertible Issues and Warrants</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This point is well illustrated by an offering of two issues of
Ford Motor Finance Co. made simultaneously in November 1971. One was a
20-year nonconvertible bond, yielding 7½%. The other was a 25-year bond,
subordinated to the first in order of claim and yielding only 4½%; but
it was made convertible into Ford Motor stock, against its then price of
68½. To obtain the conversion privilege the buyer gave up 40% of income
and accepted a junior-creditor position.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that in late 1971 Studebaker-Worthington common sold as low
as 38 while the preferred sold at or about 77. The spread had thus grown
from 2 to 20 points during the year, illustrating once more the
desirability of such switches and also the tendency of the stock market
to neglect arithmetic. (Incidentally the small premium of the preferred
over the common in December 1970 had already been made up by its higher
dividend.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Chapter 17. Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>See, for example, the article “Six Flags at Half Mast,” by Dr. A. J.
Briloff, in January 11, 1971.</li>
</ol>
<p>Chapter 18. A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The reader will recall from p. 434 above that AAA Enterprises tried
to enter this business, but quickly failed. Here Graham is making a
profound and paradoxical observation: The more money a company makes,
the more likely it is to face new competition, since its high returns
signal so clearly that easy money is to be had. The new competition, in
turn, will lead to lower prices and smaller profits. This crucial point
was overlooked by overenthusiastic Internet stock buyers, who believed
that early winners would sustain their advantage indefinitely.</li>
</ol>
<p>Chapter 19. Shareholders and Managements: Dividend Policy</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Analytical studies have shown that in the typical case a dollar paid
out in dividends had as much as four times the positive effect on market
price as had a dollar of undistributed earnings. This point was well
illustrated by the public-utility group for a number of years before
1950. The low-payout issues sold at low multipliers of earnings, and
proved to be especially attractive buys because their dividends were
later advanced. Since 1950 payout rates have been much more uniform for
the industry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Chapter 20. “Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of
Investment</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This argument is supported by Paul Hallingby, Jr., “Speculative
Opportunities in Stock-Purchase Warrants,” third quarter 1947.</li>
</ol>
<p>Postscript</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Veracity requires the admission that the deal almost fell through
because the partners wanted assurance that the purchase price would be
100% covered by asset value. A future 00 million or more in market gain
turned on, say, 0,000 of accounting items. By dumb luck they got what
they insisted on.</li>

<p>1 Coauthored with David Dodd and first published in 1934.</p>
<p>2 The Grossbaums changed their name to Graham during World War I,
when German-sounding names were regarded with suspicion.</p>
<p>3 Graham-Newman Corp. was an open-end mutual fund (see Chapter 9)
that Graham ran in partnership with Jerome Newman, a skilled investor in
his own right. For much of its history, the fund was closed to new
investors. I am grateful to Walter Schloss for providing data essential
to estimating Graham-Newman’s returns. The 20% annual average return
that Graham cites in his Postscript (p. 532) appears not to take
management fees into account.</p>
<p>4 The text reproduced here is the Fourth Revised Edition, updated by
Graham in 1971–1972 and initially published in 1973.</p>
<ul>
<li>The two partners Graham coyly refers to are Jerome Newman and
Benjamin Graham himself.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Graham is describing the Government Employees Insurance Co., or
GEICO, in which he and Newman purchased a 50% interest in 1948, right
around the time he finished writing The Intelligent Investor. The 12,500
that Graham and Newman put into GEICO was roughly 25% of their fund’s
assets at the time. Graham was a member of GEICO’s board of directors
for many years. In a nice twist of fate, Graham’s greatest student,
Warren Buffett, made an immense bet of his own on GEICO in 1976, by
which time the big insurer had slid to the brink of bankruptcy. It
turned out to be one of Buffett’s best investments as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of a legal technicality, Graham and Newman were directed by
the U.S. Securities andandandand Exchange Commission to “spin off,” or
distribute, Graham-Newman Corp.’s GEICO stake to the fund’s
shareholders. An investor who owned 100 shares of Graham-Newman at the
beginning of 1948 (worth 1,413) and who then held on to the GEICO
distribution would have had .66 million by 1972. GEICO’s
“later-organized affiliates” included Government Employees Financial

<p>1 Graham’s anecdote is also a powerful reminder that those of us who
are not as brilliant as he was must always diversify to protect against
the risk of putting too much money into a single investment. When Graham
himself admits that GEICO was a “lucky break,” that’s a signal that most
of us cannot count on being able to find such a great opportunity. To
keep investing from decaying into gambling, you must diversify.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The survey Graham cites was conducted for the Fed by the
University of Michigan and was published in the Federal Reserve
Bulletin, July, 1948. People were asked, “Suppose a man decides not to
spend his money. He can either put it in a bank or in bonds or he can
invest it. What do you think would be the wisest thing for him to do
with the money nowadays—put it in the bank, buy savings bonds with it,
invest it in real estate, or buy common stock with it?” Only 4% thought
common stock would offer a “satisfactory” return; 26% considered it “not
safe” or a “gamble.” From 1949 through 1958, the stock market earned one
of its highest 10-year returns in history, averaging 18.7% annually. In
a fascinating echo of that early Fed survey, a poll conducted by
BusinessWeek at year-end 2002 found that only 24% of investors were
willing to invest more in their mutual funds or stock portfolios, down
from 47% just three years earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Speculation is beneficial on two levels: First, without
speculation, untested new companies (like Amazon.com or, in earlier
times, the Edison Electric Light Co.) would never be able to raise the
necessary capital for expansion. The alluring, long-shot chance of a
huge gain is the grease that lubricates the machinery of innovation.
Secondly, risk is exchanged (but never eliminated) every time a stock is
bought or sold. The buyer purchases the primary risk that this stock may
go down. Meanwhile, the seller still retains a residual risk—the chance
that the stock he just sold may go up!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† A margin account enables you to buy stocks using money you borrow
from the brokerage firm. By investing with borrowed money, you make more
when your stocks go up—but you can be wiped out when they go down. The
collateral for the loan is the value of the investments in your
account—so you must put up more money if that value falls below the
amount you borrowed. For more information about margin accounts, see
www.sec.gov/investor/ pubs/margin.htm,
www.sia.com/publications/pdf/MarginsA.pdf, and www.

<ul>
<li><p>Read Graham’s sentence again, and note what this greatest of
investing experts is saying: The future of security prices is never
predictable. And as you read ahead in the book, notice how everything
else Graham tells you is designed to help you grapple with that truth.
Since you cannot predict the behavior of the markets, you must learn how
to predict and control your own behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>How well did Graham’s forecast pan out? At first blush, it seems,
very well: From the beginning of 1972 through the end of 1981, stocks
earned an annual average return of 6.5%. (Graham did not specify the
time period for his forecast, but it’s plausible to assume that he was
thinking of a 10-year time horizon.) However, inflation raged at 8.6%
annually over this period, eating up the entire gain that stocks
produced. In this section of his chapter, Graham is summarizing what is
known as the “Gordon equation,” which essentially holds that the stock
market’s future return is the sum of the current dividend yield plus
expected earnings growth. With a dividend yield of just under 2% in
early 2003, and long-term earnings growth of around 2%, plus inflation
at a bit over 2%, a future average annual return of roughly 6% is
plausible. (See the commentary on Chapter 3.)</p></li>
<li><p>Since 1997, when Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or
TIPS) were introduced, stocks have no longer been the automatically
superior choice for investors who expect inflation to increase. TIPS,
unlike other bonds, rise in value if the Consumer Price Index goes up,
effectively immunizing the investor against losing money after
inflation. Stocks carry no such guarantee and, in fact, are a relatively
poor hedge against high rates of inflation. (For more details, see the
commentary to Chapter 2.)</p></li>
<li><p>Today, the most widely available alternatives to the Dow Jones
Industrial Average are the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index
(the “S andandandand P”) and the Wilshire 5000 index. The S andandandand
P focuses on 500 large, well-known companies that make up roughly 70% of
the total value of the U.S. equity market. The Wilshire 5000 follows the
returns of nearly every significant, publicly traded stock in America,
roughly 6,700 in all; but, since the largest companies account for most
of the total value of the index, the return of the Wilshire 5000 is
usually quite similar to that of the S andandandand P 500. Several
low-cost mutual funds enable investors to hold the stocks in these
indexes as a single, convenient portfolio. (See Chapter 9.)</p></li>

<li><p>For more advice on “well-established investment funds,” see
Chapter 9. “Professional administration” by “a recognized
investment-counsel firm” is discussed in Chapter 10. “Dollar-cost
averaging” is explained in Chapter 5.</p></li>
<li><p>See Chapter 8.</p></li>
<li><p>In “selling short” (or “shorting”) a stock, you make a bet that
its share price will go down, not up. Shorting is a three-step process:
First, you borrow shares from someone who owns them; then you
immediately sell the borrowed shares; finally, you replace them with
shares you buy later. If the stock drops, you will be able to buy your
replacement shares at a lower price. The difference between the price at
which you sold your borrowed shares and the price you paid for the
replacement shares is your gross profit (reduced by dividend or interest
charges, along with brokerage costs). However, if the stock goes up in
price instead of down, your potential loss is unlimited—making short
sales unacceptably speculative for most individual investors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† In the late 1980s, as hostile corporate takeovers and leveraged
buyouts multiplied, Wall Street set up institutional arbitrage desks to
profit from any errors in pricing these complex deals. They became so
good at it that the easy profits disappeared and many of these desks
have been closed down. Although Graham does discuss it again (see
pp. 174–175), this sort of trading is no longer feasible or appropriate
for most people, since only multimillion-dollar trades are large enough
to generate worthwhile profits. Wealthy individuals and institutions can
utilize this strategy through hedge funds that specialize in merger or
“event” arbitrage.</p>

dominant power in European investment banking and brokerage in the
nineteenth century. For a brilliant history, see Niall Ferguson, The
House of Rothschild: Money’s Prophets, 1798–1848 (Viking, 1998).</li>
</ul>
<p>1 Graham goes even further, fleshing out each of the key terms in his
definition: “thorough analysis” means “the study of the facts in the
light of established standards of safety and value” while “safety of
principal” signifies “protection against loss under all normal or
reasonably likely conditions or variations” and “adequate” (or
“satisfactory”) return refers to “any rate or amount of return, however
low, which the investor is willing to accept, provided he acts with
reasonable intelligence.” (Security Analysis, 1934 ed., pp. 55–56).</p>
<p>2 Security Analysis, 1934 ed., p. 310.</p>
<p>3 As Graham advised in an interview, “Ask yourself: If there was no
market for these shares, would I be willing to have an investment in
this company on these terms?” (Forbes, January 1, 1972, p. 90.)</p>
<p>4 Source: Steve Galbraith, Sanford C. Bernstein andandandand
Co. research report, January 10, 2000. The stocks in this table had an
average return of 1196.4% in 1999. They lost an average of 79.1% in
2000, 35.5% in 2001, and 44.5% in 2002—destroying all the gains of 1999,
and then some.</p>
<p>5 Instead of stargazing, Streisand should have been channeling
Graham. The intelligent investor never dumps a stock purely because its
share price has fallen; she always asks first whether the value of the
company’s underlying businesses has changed.</p>

<p>7 A ticker symbol is an abbreviation, usually one to four letters
long, of a company’s name used as shorthand to identify a stock for
trading purposes.</p>
<p>8 This was not an isolated incident; on at least three other
occasions in the late 1990s, day traders sent the wrong stock soaring
when they mistook its ticker symbol for that of a newly minted Internet
company.</p>
<p>9 In 2000 and 2001, Amazon.com and Qualcomm lost a cumulative total
of 85.8% and 71.3% of their value, respectively.</p>

<p>13 In a remarkable irony, the surviving two O’Shaughnessy funds (now
known as the Hennessy funds) began performing quite well just as
O’Shaughnessy announced that he was turning over the management to
another company. The funds’ shareholders were furious. In a chat room at
www.morningstar.com, one fumed: “I guess ‘long term’ for O’S is 3
years…. I feel your pain. I, too, had faith in O’S’s method…. I had told
severalfriends and relatives about this fund, and now am glad they
didn’t act on my advice.”</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The list of sources for investment advice remains as
“miscellaneous” as it was when Graham wrote. A survey of investors
conducted in late 2002 for the Securities Industry Association, a Wall
Street trade group, found that 17% of investors depended most heavily
for investment advice on a spouse or friend; 2% on a banker; 16% on a
broker; 10% on financial periodicals; and 24% on a financial planner.
The only difference from Graham’s day is that 8% of investors now rely
heavily on the Internet and 3% on financial television. (See
www.sia.com.)</p></li>
<li><p>The character of investment counseling firms and trust banks has
not changed, but today they generally do not offer their services to
investors with less than million in financial assets; in some cases,
million or more is required. Today thousands of independent
financial-planning firms perform very similar functions, although (as
analyst Robert Veres puts it) the mutual fund has replaced blue-chip
stocks as the investment of choice and diversification has replaced
“quality” as the standard of safety.</p></li>
<li><p>Overall, Graham was as tough and cynical an observer as Wall
Street has ever seen. In this rare case, however, he was not nearly
cynical enough. Wall Street may have higher ethical standards than some
businesses (smuggling, prostitution, Congressional lobbying, and
journalism come to mind) but the investment world nevertheless has
enough liars, cheaters, and thieves to keep Satan’s check-in clerks
frantically busy for decades to come.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† The thousands of people who bought stocks in the late 1990s in the
belief that Wall Street analysts were providing unbiased and valuable
advice have learned, in a painful way, how right Graham is on this
point.</p>
<p>† ‡ Interestingly, this stinging criticism, which in his day Graham
was directing at full-service brokers, ended up applying to discount
Internet brokers in the late 1990s. These firms spent millions of
dollars on flashy advertising that goaded their customers into trading
more and trading faster. Most of those customers ended up picking their
own pockets, instead of paying someone else to do it for them—and the
cheap commissions on that kind of transaction are a poor consolation for
the result. More traditional brokerage firms, meanwhile, began
emphasizing financial planning and “integrated asset management,”
instead of compensating their brokers only on the basis of how many
commissions they could generate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This remains true, although many of Wall Street’s best analysts
hold the title of chartered financial analyst. The CFA certification is
awarded by the Association of Investment Management andandandand
Research (formerly the Financial Analysts Federation) only after the
candidate has completed years of rigorous study and passed a series of
difficult exams. More than 50,000 analysts worldwide have been certified
as CFAs. Sadly, a recent survey by Professor Stanley Block found that
most CFAs ignore Graham’s teachings: Growth potential ranks higher than
quality of earnings, risks, and dividend policy in determining P/E
ratios, while far more analysts base their buy ratings on recent price
than on the long-term outlook for the company. See Stanley Block, “A
Study of Financial Analysts: Practice and Theory,” Financial Analysts
Journal, July/August, 1999, at www.aimrpubs.org. As Graham was fond of
saying, his own books have been read by—and ignored by—more people than
any other books in finance.</p></li>
<li><p>It is highly unusual today for a security analyst to allow mere
commoners to contact him directly. For the most part, only the nobility
of institutional investors are permitted to approach the throne of the
almighty Wall Street analyst. An individual investor might, perhaps,
have some luck calling analysts who work at “regional” brokerage firms
headquartered outside of New York City. The investor relations area at
the websites of most publicly traded companies will provide a list of
analysts who follow the stock. Websites like www.zacks.com and
www.multex.com offer access to analysts’ research reports—but the
intelligent investor should remember that most analysts do not analyze
businesses. Instead, they engage in guesswork about future stock
prices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Benjamin Graham was the prime force behind the establishment of the
CFA program, which he advocated for nearly two decades before it became
a reality.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The two firms Graham had in mind were probably Du Pont, Glore,
Forgan andandandand Co. and Goodbody andandandand Co. Du Pont (founded
by the heirs to the chemical fortune) was saved from insolvency in 1970
only after Texas entrepreneur H. Ross Perot lent more than 0 million to
the firm; Goodbody, the fifth-largest brokerage firm in the United
States, would have failed in late 1970 had Merrill Lynch not acquired
it. Hayden, Stone andandandand Co. would also have gone under if it had
not been acquired. In 1970, no fewer than seven brokerage firms went
bust. The farcical story of Wall Street’s frenzied over-expansion in the
late 1960s is beautifully told in John Brooks’s The Go-Go Years (John
Wiley andandandand Sons, New York, 1999).</p></li>
<li><p>Nearly all brokerage transactions are now conducted
electronically, and securities are no longer physically “delivered.”
Thanks to the establishment of the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation, or SIPC, in 1970, investors are generally assured of
recovering their full account values if their brokerage firm becomes
insolvent. SIPC is a government-mandated consortium of brokers; all the
members agree to pool their assets to cover losses incurred by the
customers of any firm that becomes insolvent. SIPC’s protection
eliminates the need for investors to make payment and take delivery
through a bank intermediary, as Graham urges.</p></li>
<li><p>Those who heeded Graham’s advice would not have been suckered
into buying Internet IPOs in 1999 and 2000.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† This traditional role of bankers has for the most part been
supplanted by accountants, lawyers, or financial planners.</p>

<p>2 If you’re unable to get a referral from someone you trust, you may
be able to find a fee-only financial planner through www.napfa.org (or
www.feeonly. org), whose members are generally held to high standards of
service and integrity.</p>
<p>3 By itself, a customer complaint is not enough to disqualify an
adviser from your consideration; but a persistent pattern of complaints
is. And a disciplinary action by state or Federal regulators usually
tells you to find another adviser. Another source for checking a
broker’s record is http://pdpi.nasdr. com/PDPI.</p>
<p>4 Robert Veres, editor and publisher of the Inside Information
newsletter, generously shared these responses for this book. Other
checklists of questions can be found at www.cfp-board.org and
www.napfa.org.</p>
<p>5 Credentials like the CFA, CFP, or CPA tell you that the adviser has
taken and passed a rigorous course of study. (Most of the other
“alphabet soup” of credentials brandished by financial planners,
including the “CFM” or the “CMFC,” signify very little.) More important,
by contacting the organization that awards the credential, you can
verify his record and check that he has not been disciplined for
violations of rules or ethics.</p>
<p>6 If you have less than 00,000 to invest, you may not be able to find
a financial adviser who will take your account. In that case, buy a
diversified basket of low-cost index funds, follow the behavioral advice
throughout this book, and your portfolio should eventually grow to the
level at which you can afford an adviser.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The National Federation of Financial Analysts is now the
Association for Investment Management and Research; its “quarterly”
research publication, the Financial Analysts Journal, now appears every
other month.</p></li>
<li><p>The higher the growth rate you project, and the longer the future
period over which you project it, the more sensitive your forecast
becomes to the slightest error. If, for instance, you estimate that a
company earning per share can raise that profit by 15% a year for the
next 15 years, its earnings would end up at .14. If the market values
the company at 35 times earnings, the stock would finish the period at
roughly 85. But if earnings grow at 14% instead of 15%, the company
would earn .14 at the end of the period—and, in the shock of that
shortfall, investors would no longer be willing to pay 35 times
earnings. At, say, 20 times earnings, the stock would end up around 40
per share, or more than 50% less. Because advanced mathematics gives the
appearance of precision to the inherently iffy process of foreseeing the
future, investors must be highly skeptical of anyone who claims to hold
any complex computational key to basic financial problems. As Graham put
it: “In 44 years of Wall Street experience and study, I have never seen
dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or related
investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or the most
elementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in, or higher algebra,
you could take it as a warning signal that the operator was trying to
substitute theory for experience, and usually also to give to
speculation the deceptive guise of investment.” (See p. 570.)</p></li>
<li><p>In 1972, an investor in corporate bonds had little choice but to
assemble his or her own portfolio. Today, roughly 500 mutual funds
invest in corporate bonds, creating a convenient, well-diversified
bundle of securities. Since it is not feasible to build a diversified
bond portfolio on your own unless you have at least 00,000, the typical
intelligent investor will be best off simply buying a low-cost bond fund
and leaving the painstaking labor of credit research to its managers.
For more on bond funds, see the commentary on Chapter 4.</p></li>
<li><p>By “junior stock issues” Graham means shares of common stock.
Preferred stock is considered “senior” to common stock because the
company must pay all dividends on the preferred before paying any
dividends on the common.</p></li>
<li><p>After investors lost billions of dollars on the shares of
recklessly assembled utility companies in 1929–1932, Congress authorized
the SEC to regulate the issuance of utility stocks under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.</p></li>
<li><p>In more recent years, most mutual funds have almost robotically
mimicked the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index, lest any
different holdings cause their returns to deviate from that of the
index. In a countertrend, some fund companies have launched what they
call “focused” portfolios, which own 25 to 50 stocks that the managers
declare to be their “best ideas.” That leaves investors wondering
whether the other funds run by the same managers contain their worst
ideas. Considering that most of the “best idea” funds do not markedly
outperform the averages, investors are also entitled to wonder whether
the managers’ ideas are even worth having in the first place. For
indisputably skilled investors like Warren Buffett, wide diversification
would be foolish, since it would water down the concentrated force of a
few great ideas. But for the typical fund manager or individual
investor, not diversifying is foolish, since it is so difficult to
select a limited number of stocks that will include most winners and
exclude most losers. As you own more stocks, the damage any single loser
can cause will decline, and the odds of owning all the big winners will
rise. The ideal choice for most investors is a total stock market index
fund, a low-cost way to hold every stock worth owning.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham’s point about chemical and oil companies in the 1960s
applies to nearly every industry in nearly every time period. Wall
Street’s consensus view of the future for any given sector is usually
either too optimistic or too pessimistic. Worse, the consensus is at its
most cheery just when the stocks are most overpriced—and gloomiest just
when they are cheapest. The most recent example, of course, is
technology and telecommunications stocks, which hit record highs when
their future seemed brightest in 1999 and early 2000, and then crashed
all the way through 2002. History proves that Wall Street’s “expert”
forecasters are equally inept at predicting the performance of 1) the
market as a whole, 2) industry sectors, and 3) specific stocks. As
Graham points out, the odds that individual investors can do any better
are not good. The intelligent investor excels by making decisions that
are not dependent on the accuracy of anybody’s forecasts, including his
or her own. (See Chapter 8.)</p></li>
<li><p>This figure, now known as the “dividend payout ratio,” has
dropped considerably since Graham’s day as American tax law discouraged
investors from seeking, and corporations from paying, dividends. As of
year-end 2002, the payout ratio stood at 34.1% for the S andandandand P
500-stock index and, as recently as April 2000, it hit an all-time low
of just 25.3%. (See www.barra.com/ research/fundamentals.asp.) We
discuss dividend policy more thoroughly in the commentary on Chapter
19.</p></li>
<li><p>Why is this? By “the rule of 72,” at 10% interest a given amount
of money doubles in just over seven years, while at 7% it doubles in
just over 10 years. When interest rates are high, the amount of money
you need to set aside today to reach a given value in the future is
lower—since those high interest rates will enable it to grow at a more
rapid rate. Thus a rise in interest rates today makes a future stream of
earnings or dividends less valuable—since the alternative of investing
in bonds has become relatively more attractive.</p></li>
<li><p>These industry groups, ideally, would not be overly dependent on
such unforeseeable factors as fluctuating interest rates or the future
direction of prices for raw materials like oil or metals. Possibilities
might be industries like gaming, cosmetics, alcoholic beverages, nursing
homes, or waste management.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1 Because so few of today’s individual investors buy—or should
buy—individual bonds, we will limit this discussion to stock analysis.
For more on bond funds, see the commentary on Chapter 4.</p>
<p>2 You should also get at least one year’s worth of quarterly reports
(on Form 10-Q). By definition, we are assuming that you are an
“enterprising” investor willing to devote a considerable amount of
effort to your portfolio. If the steps in this chapter sound like too
much work to you, then you are not temperamentally well suited to
picking your own stocks. You cannot reliably obtain the results you
imagine unless you put in the kind of effort we describe.</p>
<p>3 You can usually find details on acquisitions in the “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis” section of Form 10-K; cross-check it against
the footnotes to the financial statements. For more on “serial
acquirers,” see the commentary on Chapter 12.</p>
<p>4 To determine whether a company is an OPM addict, read the
“Statement of Cash Flows” in the financial statements. This page breaks
down the company’s cash inflows and outflows into “operating
activities,” “investing activities,” and “financing activities.” If cash
from operating activities is consistently negative, while cash from
financing activities is consistently positive, the company has a habit
of craving more cash than its own businesses can produce—and you should
not join the “enablers” of that habitual abuse. For more on Global
Crossing, see the commentary on Chapter 12. For more on WorldCom, see

<p>10 Stock splits are discussed further in the commentary on Chapter
13.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Dilution” is one of many words that describe stocks in the language
of fluid dynamics. A stock with high trading volume is said to be
“liquid.” When a company goes public in an IPO, it “floats” its shares.
And, in earlier days, a company that drastically diluted its shares
(with large amounts of convertible debt or multiple offerings of common
stock) was said to have “watered” its stock. This term is believed to
have originated with the legendary market manipulator Daniel Drew
(1797–1879), who began as a livestock trader. He would drive his cattle
south toward Manhattan, force-feeding them salt along the way. When they
got to the Harlem River, they would guzzle huge volumes of water to
slake their thirst. Drew would then bring them to market, where the
water they had just drunk would increase their weight. That enabled him
to get a much higher price, since cattle on the hoof is sold by the
pound. Drew later watered the stock of the Erie Railroad by massively
issuing new shares without warning.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Graham is referring to the precise craftsmanship of the immigrant
Italian stone carvers who ornamented the otherwise plain facades of
buildings throughout New York in the early 1900s. Accountants, likewise,
can transform simple financial facts into intricate and even
incomprehensible patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The king probably took his inspiration from a once-famous essay
by the English writer William Hazlitt, who mused about a sundial near
Venice that bore the words Horas non numero nisi serenas, or “I count
only the hours that are serene.” Companies that chronically exclude bad
news from their financial results on the pretext that negative events
are “extraordinary” or “nonrecurring” are taking a page from Hazlitt,
who urged his readers “to take no note of time but by its benefits, to
watch only for the smiles and neglect the frowns of fate, to compose our
lives of bright and gentle moments, turning away to the sunny side of
things, and letting the rest slip from our imaginations, unheeded or
forgotten!” (William Hazlitt, “On a Sun-Dial,” ca.1827.) Unfortunately,
investors must always count the sunny and dark hours alike.</p></li>
<li><p>The company to which Graham refers so coyly appears to be
American Machine andandandand Foundry (or AMF Corp.), one of the most
jumbled conglomerates of the late 1960s. It was a predecessor of today’s
AMF Bowling Worldwide, which operates bowling alleys and manufactures
bowling equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>Nowadays, investors need to be aware of several other “accounting
factors” that can distort reported earnings. One is “pro forma” or “as
if” financial statements, which report a company’s earnings as if
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) did not apply. Another
is the dilutive effect of issuing millions of stock options for
executive compensation, then buying back millions of shares to keep
those options from reducing the value of the common stock. A third is
unrealistic assumptions of return on the company’s pension funds, which
can artificially inflate earnings in good years and depress them in bad.
Another is “Special Purpose Entities,” oraffiliated firms or
partnerships that buy risky assets or liabilities of the company and
thus “remove” those financial risks from the company’s balance sheet.
Another element of distortion is the treatment of marketing or other
“soft” costs as assets of the company, rather than as normal expenses of
doing business. We will briefly examine such practices in the commentary
that accompanies this chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Northwest Industries was the holding company for, among other
businesses, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Co. and Union Underwear
(the maker of both BVD and Fruit of the Loom briefs). It was taken over
in 1985 by overindebted financier William Farley, who ran the company
into the ground. Fruit of the Loom was bought in a bankruptcy proceeding
by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in early 2002.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is referring to the provision of Federal tax law that
allows corporations to “carry forward” their net operating losses. As
the tax code now stands, these losses can be carried forward for up to
20 years, reducing the company’s tax liability for the entire period
(and thus raising its earnings after tax). Therefore, investors should
consider whether recent severe losses could actually improve the
company’s net earnings in the future.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Investors should keep these words at hand and remind themselves of
them frequently: “Stock valuations are really dependable only in
exceptional cases.” While the prices of most stocks are approximately
right most of the time, the price of a stock and the value of its
business are almost never identical. The market’s judgment on price is
often unreliable. Unfortunately, the margin of the market’s pricing
errors is often not wide enough to justify the expense of trading on
them. The intelligent investor must carefully evaluate the costs of
trading and taxes before attempting to take advantage of any price
discrepancy—and should never count on being able to sell for the exact
price currently quoted in the market.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Mean figure” refers to the simple, or arithmetic, average that
Graham describes in the preceding sentence.</li>
</ul>
<p>aThree-fifths of special charges of 82 cents in 1970 deducted

<ul>
<li><p>Graham appears to be using “earnings on capital funds” in the
traditional sense of return on book value—essentially, net income
divided by the company’s tangible net assets.</p></li>
<li><p>See pp. 299–301.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Recent history—and a mountain of financial research—have shown that
the market is unkindest to rapidly growing companies that suddenly
report a fall in earnings. More moderate and stable growers, as ALCOA
was in Graham’s day or Anheuser-Busch and Colgate-Palmolive are in our
time, tend to suffer somewhat milder stock declines if they report
disappointing earnings. Great expectations lead to great disappointment
if they are not met; a failure to meet moderate expectations leads to a
much milder reaction. Thus, one of the biggest risks in owning growth
stocks is not that their growth will stop, but merely that it will slow
down. And in the long run, that is not merely a risk, but a virtual
certainty.</p>
<p>1 For more on how stock options can enrich corporate managers—but not
necessarily outside shareholders—see the commentary on Chapter 19.</p>
<p>2 All the above examples are taken directly from press releases
issued by the companies themselves. For a brilliant satire on what daily
life would be like if we all got to justify our behavior the same way
companies adjust their reported earnings, see “My Pro Forma Life,” by
Rob Walker, at http://slate. msn.com/?id=2063953. (“…a recent
post-workout lunch of a 22-ounce, bone-in rib steak at Smith
andandandand Wollensky and three shots of bourbon is treated here as a
nonrecurring expense. I’ll never do that again!”)</p>
<p>3 In 2002, Qwest was one of 330 publicly-traded companies to restate
past financial statements, an all-time record, according to Huron
Consulting Group. All information on Qwest is taken from its financial
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (annual report,
Form 8K, and Form 10-K) found in the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. No
hindsight was required to detect the “change in accounting principle,”
which Qwest fully disclosed at the time. How did Qwest’s shares do over
this period? At year-end 2000, the stock had been at 1 per share, a
total market value of 7.9 billion. By early 2003, Qwest was around ,
valuing the entire company at less than billion—a 90% loss. The drop in
share price is not the only cost associated with bogus earnings; a
recent study found that a sample of 27 firms accused of accounting fraud
by the SEC had overpaid 20 million in Federal income tax. Although much
of that money will eventually be refunded by the IRS, most shareholders
are unlikely to stick around to benefit from the refunds. (See Merle
Erickson, Michelle Hanlon, and Edward Maydew, “How Much Will Firms Pay
for Earnings that Do Not Exist?” at http:// papers.ssrn.com.)</p>
<p>4 Global Crossing formerly treated much of its construction costs as
an expense to be charged against the revenue generated from the sale or
lease of usage rights on its network. Customers generally paid for their
rights up front, although some could pay in installments over periods of
up to four years. But Global Crossing did not book most of the revenues
up front, instead deferring them over the lifetime of the lease. Now,
however, because the networks had an estimated usable life of up to 25
years, Global Crossing began treating them as depreciable, long-lived
capital assets. While this treatment conforms with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles, it is unclear why Global Crossing did not use it
before October 1, 1999, or what exactly prompted the change. As of March
2001, Global Crossing had a total stock valuation of 2.6 billion; the
company filed for bankruptcy on January 28, 2002, rendering its common
stock essentially worthless.</p>
<p>5 I am grateful to Howard Schilit and Mark Hamel of the Center for
Financial Research and Analysis for providing this example.</p>
<p>6 Returns are approximated by dividing the total net value of plan
assets at the beginning of the year by “actual return on plan
assets.”</p>
<p>7 Do not be put off by the stupefyingly boring verbiage of accounting
footnotes. They are designed expressly to deter normal people from
actually reading them—which is why you must persevere. A footnote to the
1996 annual report of Informix Corp., for instance, disclosed that “The
Company generally recognizes license revenue from sales of software
licenses upon delivery of the software product to a customer. However,
for certain computer hardware manufacturers and end-user licensees with
amounts payable within twelve months, the Company will recognize revenue
at the time the customer makes a contractual commitment for a minimum
nonrefundable license fee, if such computer hardware manufacturers and
end-user licensees meet certain criteria established by the Company.” In
plain English, Informix was saying that it would credit itself for
revenues on products even if they had not yet been resold to “end-users”
(the actual customers for Informix’s software). Amid allegations by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that Informix had committed
accounting fraud, the company later restated its revenues, wiping away
44 million in such “sales.” This case is a keen reminder of the
importance of reading the fine print with a skeptical eye. I am indebted
to Martin Fridson for suggesting this example.</p>

Statements (HarperBusiness, New York, 1998 reprint of 1937 edition),
remains an excellent brief introduction to the basic principles of
earnings and expenses, assets and liabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Of Graham’s four examples, only Emerson Electric still exists in
the same form. ELTRA Corp. is no longer an independent company; it
merged with Bunker Ramo Corp. in the 1970s, putting it in the business
of supplying stock quotes to brokerage firms across an early network of
computers. What remains of ELTRA’s operations is now part of Honeywell
Corp. The firm formerly known as Emery Air Freight is now a division of
CNF Inc. Emhart Corp. was acquired by Black andandandand Decker Corp. in
1989.</p></li>
<li><p>This measure is captured in the line “Net per share/book value”
in Table 13-2, which measures the companies’ net income as a percentage
of their tangible book value.</p></li>
<li><p>In each case, Graham is referring to Section C of Table 13-2 and
dividing the high price during the 1936–1968 period by the low price.
For example, Emery’s high price of 66 divided by its low price of 1/8
equals 528, or a ratio of 528 to 1 between the high and low.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of 1970, Emerson’s .6 billion in market value truly
was “enormous,” given average stock sizes at the time. At year-end 2002,
Emerson’s common stock had a total market value of approximately 1
billion.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham was right. Of the “Nifty Fifty” stocks that were most
fashionable and highly valued in 1972, Emery fared among the worst. The
March 1, 1982, issue of Forbes reported that since 1972 Emery had lost
72.8% of its value after inflation. By late 1974, according to the
investment researchers at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, Emery’s
stock had already fallen 58% and its price/earnings ratio had plummeted
from 64 times to just 15. The “overenthusiasm” Graham had warned against
was eviscerated in short order. Can the passage of time make up for this
kind of excess? Not always: Leuthold calculated that 000 invested in
Emery in 1972 would be worth only 39 as of 1999. It’s likely that the
people who overpaid for Internet stocks in the late 1990s will not break
even for decades—if ever (see the commentary on Chapter 20).</p></li>
<li><p>Graham’s point is that, based on their prices at the time, an
investor could buy shares in these two companies for little more than
their book value, as shown in the third line of Section B in Table
13-2.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1 As we will see in Chapter 19, this rationale often means, in
practice, “to provide funds for the continued growth of the company’s
top managers’ wealth.”</p>
<p>2 Appearing on CNBC on December 30, 1999, EMC’s chief executive,
Michael Ruettgers, was asked by host Ron Insana whether “2000 and
beyond” would be as good as the 1990s had been. “It actually looks like
it’s accelerating,” boasted Ruettgers. When Insana asked if EMC’s stock
was overvalued, Ruettgers answered: “I think when you look at the
opportunity we have in front of us, it’s almost unlimited…. So while
it’s hard to predictwhether these things are overpriced, there’s such a
major change taking place that if you could find the winners today—and I
certainly think EMC is one of those people—you’ll be well rewarded in
the future.”</p>
<p>3 The “Y2K bug” or the “Year 2000 Problem” was the belief that
millions of computers worldwide would stop functioning at one second
past midnight on the morning of January 1, 2000, because programmers in
the 1960s and 1970s had not thought to allow for the possibility of any
date past 12/31/1999 in their operating code. U.S. companies spent
billions of dollars in 1999 to ensure that their computers would be
“Y2K-compliant.” In the end, at 12:00:01 A.M. on January 1, 2000,
everything worked just fine.</p>

<p>7 See Graham’s speech, “The New Speculation in Common Stocks,” in the
Appendix, p. 563.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graham describes his recommended investment policies in Chapters 4
through 7.</li>
</ul>
<p>† As we have discussed in the commentaries on Chapters 5 and 9,
today’s defensive investor can achieve this goal simply by buying a
low-cost index fund, ideally one that tracks the return of the total
U.S. stock market.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In early 2003, the yield on 10-year, AA-rated corporate bonds was
around 4.6%, suggesting—by Graham’s formula—that a stock portfolio
should have an earnings-to-price ratio at least that high. Taking the
inverse of that number (by dividing 4.6 into 100), we can derive a
“suggested maximum” P/E ratio of 21.7. At the beginning of this
paragraph Graham recommends that the “average” stock be priced about 20%
below the “maximum” ratio. That suggests that—in general—Graham would
consider stocks selling at no more than 17 times their three-year
average earnings to be potentially attractive given today’s interest
rates and market conditions. As of December 31, 2002, more than 200—or
better than 40%—of the stocks in the S andandandand P 500-stock index
had three-year average P/E ratios of 17.0 or lower. Updated AA bond
yields can be found at www.bondtalk.com.</p></li>
<li><p>An easy-to-use online stock screener that can sort the stocks in
the S andandandand P 500 by most of Graham’s criteria is available at:
www.quicken.com/ investments/stocks/search/full.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† When Graham wrote, only one major mutual fund specializing in
utility stocks—Franklin Utilities—was widely available. Today there are
more than 30. Graham could not have anticipated the financial havoc
wrought by canceled and decommissioned nuclear energy plants; nor did he
foresee the consequences of bungled regulation in California. Utility
stocks are vastly more volatile than they were in Graham’s day, and most
investors should own them only through a well-diversified, low-cost fund
like the Dow Jones U.S. Utilities Sector Index Fund (ticker symbol: IDU)
or Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU). For more information, see:
www.ishares.com and www. spdrindex.com/spdr/. (Be sure your broker will
not charge commissions to reinvest your dividends.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a remarkable confirmation of Graham’s point, the dull-sounding
Standard andandandand Poor’s Utility Index outperformed the vaunted
NASDAQ Composite Index for the 30 years ending December 31,
2002.</p></li>
<li><p>Today the financial-services industry is made up of even more
components, including commercial banks; savings andandandand loan and
mortgage-financing companies; consumer-finance firms like credit-card
issuers; money managers and trust companies; investment banks and
brokerages; insurance companies; and firms engaged in developing or
owning real estate, including real-estate investment trusts. Although
the sector is much more diversified today, Graham’s caveats about
financial soundness apply more than ever.</p></li>
<li><p>Only a few major rail stocks now remain, including Burlington
Northern, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Union Pacific. The advice in this
section is at least as relevant to airline stocks today—with their
massive current losses and a half-century of almost incessantly poor
results—as it was to railroads in Graham’s day.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is summarizing the “efficient markets hypothesis,” or EMH,
an academic theory claiming that the price of each stock incorporates
all publicly available information about the company. With millions of
investors scouring the market every day, it is unlikely that severe
mispricings can persist for long. An old joke has two finance professors
walking along the sidewalk; when one spots a 0 bill and bends over to
pick it up, the other grabs his arm and says, “Don’t bother. If it was
really a 0 bill, someone would have taken it already.” While the market
is not perfectly efficient, it is pretty close most of the time—so the
intelligent investor will stoop to pick up the stock market’s 0 bills
only after researching them thoroughly and minimizing the costs of
trading and taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>This is one of the central points of Graham’s book. All investors
labor under a cruel irony: We invest in the present, but we invest for
the future. And, unfortunately, the future is almost entirely uncertain.
Inflation and interest rates are undependable; economic recessions come
and go at random; geopolitical upheavals like war, commodity shortages,
and terrorism arrive without warning; and the fate of individual
companies and their industries often turns out to be the opposite of
what most investors expect. Therefore, investing on the basis of
projection is a fool’s errand; even the forecasts of the so-called
experts are less reliable than the flip of a coin. For most people,
investing on the basis of protection—from overpaying for a stock and
from overconfidence in the quality of their own judgment—is the best
solution. Graham expands on this concept in Chapter 20.</p></li>

<p>1 Adjusted for stock splits. To many people, MicroStrategy really did
look like the next Microsoft in early 2000; its stock had gained 566.7%
in 1999, and its chairman, Michael Saylor, declared that “our future
today is better than it was 18 months ago.” The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission later accused MicroStrategy of accounting fraud, and
Saylor paid an .3 million fine to settle the charges.</p>

<p>4 For more on what to look for, see the commentary on Chapters 11,
12, and 19. If you are not willing to go to the minimal effort of
reading the proxy and making basic comparisons of financial health
across five years’ worth of annual reports, then you are too defensive
to be buying individual stocks at all. Get yourself out of the
stock-picking business and into an index fund, where you belong.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Friend-Blume-Crockett research covered January 1960, through
June 1968, and compared the performance of more than 100 major mutual
funds against the returns on portfolios constructed randomly from more
than 500 of the largest stocks listed on the NYSE. The funds in the
Friend-Blume-Crockett study did better from 1965 to 1968 than they had
in the first half of the measurement period, much as Graham found in his
own research (see above, pp. 158 and 229–232). But that improvement did
not last. And the thrust of these studies—that mutual funds, on average,
underperform the market by a margin roughly equal to their operating
expenses and trading costs—has been reconfirmed so many times that
anyone who doubts them should found a financial chapter of The Flat
Earth Society.</p></li>
<li><p>As we discuss in the commentary on Chapter 9, there are several
other reasons mutual funds have not been able to outperform the market
averages, including the low returns on the funds’ cash balances and the
high costs of researching and trading stocks. Also, a fund holding 120
companies (a typical number) can trail the S andandandand P 500-stock
index if any of the other 380 companies in that benchmark turns out to
be a great performer. The fewer stocks a fund owns, the more likely it
is to miss “the next Microsoft.”</p></li>
<li><p>In this section, as he did also on pp. 363–364, Graham is
summarizing the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Recent appearances to the
contrary, the problem with the stock market today is not that so many
financial analysts are idiots, but rather that so many of them are so
smart. As more and more smart people search the market for bargains,
that very act of searching makes those bargains rarer—and, in a cruel
paradox, makes the analysts look as if they lack the intelligence to
justify the search. The market’s valuation of a given stock is the
result of a vast, continuous, real-time operation of collective
intelligence. Most of the time, for most stocks, that collective
intelligence gets the valuation approximately right. Only rarely does
Graham’s “Mr. Market” (see Chapter 8) send prices wildly out of
whack.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Graham launched Graham-Newman Corp. in January 1936, and dissolved
it when he retired from active money management in 1956; it was the
successor to a partnership called the Benjamin Graham Joint Account,
which he ran from January 1926, through December 1935.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An “unrelated” hedge involves buying a stock or bond issued by
one company and short-selling (or betting on a decline in) a security
issued by a different company. A “related” hedge involves buying and
selling different stocks or bonds issued by the same company. The “new
group” of hedge funds described by Graham were widely available around
1968, but later regulation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission restricted access to hedge funds for the general
public.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2003, an intelligent investor following Graham’s train of
thought would be searching for opportunities in the technology,
telecommunications, and electric-utility industries. History has shown
that yesterday’s losers are often tomorrow’s winners.</p></li>
<li><p>The successor corporation to Industrial National Bank of Rhode
Island is FleetBoston Financial Corp. One of its corporate ancestors,
the Providence Bank, was founded in 1791.</p></li>
<li><p>For today’s investor, the cutoff is more likely to be around per
share—the level below which many stocks are “delisted,” or declared
ineligible for trading on major exchanges. Just monitoring the stock
prices of these companies can take a considerable amount of effort,
making them impractical for defensive investors. The costs of trading
low-priced stocks can be very high. Finally, companies with very low
stock prices have a distressing tendency to go out of business. However,
a diversified portfolio of dozens of these distressed companies may
still appeal to some enterprising investors today.</p></li>
<li><p>In Graham’s terms, a large amount of goodwill can result from two
causes: a corporation can acquire other companies for substantially more
than the value of their assets, or its own stock can trade for
substantially more than its book value.</p></li>
<li><p>Technically, the working-capital value of a stock is the current
assets per share, minus the current liabilities per share, divided by
the number of shares outstanding. Here, however, Graham means “net
working-capital value,” or the per-share value of current assets minus
total liabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connaît point. This
poetic passage is one of the concluding arguments in the great French
theologian’s discussion of what has come to be known as “Pascal’s wager”
(see commentary on Chapter 20).</p></li>
<li><p>As discussed in the commentary on Chapter 7, merger arbitrage is
wholly inappropriate for most individual investors.</p></li>

<p>1 As a brief example of how convertible bonds work in practice,
consider the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes issued by DoubleClick
Inc. in 1999. They pay 7.50 in interest per year and are each
convertible into 24.24 shares of the company’s common stock, a
“conversion ratio” of 24.24. As of year-end 2002, DoubleClick’s stock
was priced at .66 a share, giving each bond a “conversion value” of
37.20 (.66 24.24). Yet the bonds traded roughly six times higher, at
81.30—creating a “conversion premium,” or excess over their conversion
value, of 542%. If you bought at that price, your “break-even time,” or
“payback period,” was very long. (You paid roughly 50 more than the
conversion value of the bond, so it will takenearly 16 years of 7.50
interest payments for you to “earn back” that conversion premium.) Since
each DoubleClick bond is convertible to just over 24 common shares, the
stock will have to rise from .66 to more than 6 if conversion is to
become a practical option before the bonds mature in 2006. Such a stock
return is not impossible, but it borders on the miraculous. The cash
yield on this particular bond scarcely seems adequate, given the low
probability of conversion.</p>
<p>2 Like many of the track records commonly cited on Wall Street, this
one is hypothetical. It indicates the return you would have earned in an
imaginary index fund that owned all major convertibles. It does not
include any management fees or trading costs (which are substantial for
convertible securities). In the real world, your returns would have been
roughly two percentage points lower.</p>
<p>3 However, most convertible bonds remain junior to other long-term
debt and bank loans—so, in a bankruptcy, convertible holders do not have
priorclaim to the company’s assets. And, while they are not nearly as
dicey as high-yield “junk” bonds, many converts are still issued by
companies with less than sterling credit ratings. Finally, a large
portion of the convertible market is held by hedge funds, whose
rapid-fire trading can increase the volatility of prices.</p>
<p>4 For more detail, see www.fidelity.com, www.vanguard.com, and www.
morningstar.com. The intelligent investor will never buy a convertible
bond fund with annual operating expenses exceeding 1.0%.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How “shocked” was the financial world by the Penn Central’s
bankruptcy, which was filed over the weekend of June 20–21, 1970? The
closing trade in Penn Central’s stock on Friday, June 19, was 1.25 per
share—hardly a going-out-of-business price. In more recent times, stocks
like Enron and WorldCom have also sold at relatively high prices shortly
before filing for bankruptcy protection.</p></li>
<li><p>Penn Central was the product of the merger, announced in 1966, of
the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† This kind of accounting legerdemain, in which profits are reported
as if “unusual” or “extraordinary” or “nonrecurring” charges do not
matter, anticipates the reliance on “pro forma” financial statements
that became popular in the late 1990s (see the commentary on Chapter
12).</p>
<ul>
<li>A railroad’s “transportation ratio” (now more commonly called its
operating ratio) measures the expenses of running its trains divided by
the railroad’s total revenues. The higher the ratio, the less efficient
the railroad. Today even a ratio of 70% would be considered
excellent.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Today, Penn Central is a faded memory. In 1976, it was absorbed
into Consolidated Rail Corp. (Conrail), a federally-funded holding
company that bailed out several failed railroads. Conrail sold shares to
the public in 1987 and, in 1997, was taken over jointly by CSX Corp. and
Norfolk Southern Corp.</p>
<p>† Ling-Temco-Vought Inc. was founded in 1955 by James Joseph Ling,
anelectrical contractor who sold his first million worth of shares to
the public by becoming his own investment banker, hawking prospectuses
from a booth set up at the Texas State Fair. His success at that led him
to acquire dozens of different companies, almost always using LTV’s
stock to pay for them. The more companies LTV acquired, the higher its
stock went; the higher its stock went, the more companies it could
afford to acquire. By 1969, LTV was the 14th biggest firm on the Fortune
500 list of major U.S. corporations. And then, as Graham shows, the
whole house of cards came crashing down. (LTV Corp., now exclusively a
steelmaker, ended up seeking bankruptcy protection in late 2000.)
Companies that grow primarily through acquisitions are called “serial
acquirers”—and the similarity to the term “serial killers” is no
accident. As the case of LTV demonstrates, serial acquirers nearly
always leave financial death and destruction in their wake. Investors
who understood this lesson of Graham’s would have avoided such darlings
of the 1990s as Conseco, Tyco, and WorldCom.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sordid tradition of hiding a company’s true earnings picture
under the cloak of restructuring charges is still with us. Piling up
every possible charge in one year is sometimes called “big bath” or
“kitchen sink” accounting. This bookkeeping gimmick enables companies to
make an easy show of apparent growth in the following year—but investors
should not mistake that for real business health.</li>
</ul>
<p>† The “bond-discount asset” appears to mean that LTV had purchased
some bonds below their par value and was treating that discount as an
asset, on the grounds that the bonds could eventually be sold at par.
Graham scoffs at this, since there is rarely any way to know what a
bond’s market price will be on a given date in the future. If the bonds
could be sold only at values below par, this “asset” would in fact be a
liability.</p>
<p>† We can only imagine what Graham would have thought of the
investment banking firms that brought InfoSpace, Inc. public in December
1998. The stock (adjusted for later splits) opened for trading at 1.25,
peaked at 305.32 per share in March 2000, and finished 2002 at a
princely .45 per share.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Graham would have been disappointed, though surely not surprised,
to see that commercial banks have chronically kept supporting “unsound
expansions.” Enron and WorldCom, two of the biggest collapses in
corporate history, were aided and abetted by billions of dollars in bank
loans.</p></li>
<li><p>In June 1972 (just after Graham finished this chapter), a Federal
judge found that NVF’s chairman, Victor Posner, had improperly diverted
the pension assets of Sharon Steel “to assist affiliated companies in
their takeovers of other corporations.” In 1977, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission secured a permanent injunction against Posner, NVF,
and Sharon Steel to prevent them from future violations of Federal laws
against securities fraud. The Commission alleged that Posner and his
family had improperly obtained .7 million in personal perks from NVF and
Sharon, overstated Sharon’s pretax earnings by 3.9 million, misrecorded
inventory, and “shifted income and expenses from one year to another.”
Sharon Steel, which Graham had singled out with his cold and skeptical
eye, became known among Wall Street wags as “Share and Steal.” Posner
was later a central force in the wave of leveraged buyouts and hostile
takeovers that swept the United States in the 1980s, as he became a
major customer for the junk bonds underwritten by Drexel Burnham
Lambert.</p></li>
<li><p>The “large dilution factor” would be triggered when NVF employees
exercised their warrants to buy common stock. The company would then
have to issue more shares, and its net earnings would be divided across
a much greater number of shares outstanding.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Jackie G. Williams founded AAA Enterprises in 1958. On its first
day of trading, the stock soared 56% to close at 0.25. Williams later
announced that AAA would come up with a new franchising concept every
month (if people would step into a mobile home to get their income taxes
done by “Mr. Tax of America,” just imagine what else they might do
inside a trailer!). But AAA ran out of time and money before Williams
ran out of ideas. The history of AAA Enterprises is reminiscent of the
saga of a later company with charismatic management and scanty assets:
ZZZZ Best achieved a stock-market value of roughly 00 million in the
late 1980s, even though its purported industrial vacuum-cleaning
business was little more than a telephone and a rented office run by a
teenager named Barry Minkow. ZZZZ Best went bust and Minkow went to
jail. Even as you read this, another similar company is being formed,
and a new generation of “investors” will be taken for a ride. No one who
has read Graham, however, should climb on board.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In “Abou Ben Adhem,” by the British Romantic poet Leigh Hunt
(1784–1859), a righteous Muslim sees an angel writing in a golden book
“the names of those who love the Lord.” When the angel tells Abou that
his name is not among them, Abou says, “I pray thee, then, write me as
one that loves his fellow men.” The angel returns the next night to show
Abou the book, in which now “Ben Adhem’s name led all the
rest.”</p></li>
<li><p>By purchasing more common stock at a premium to its book value,
the investing public increased the value of AAA’s equity per share. But
investors were only pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, since
most of the rise in shareholders’ equity came from the public’s own
willingness to over-pay for the stock.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Graham’s point is that investment banks are not entitled to take
credit for the gains a hot stock may produce right after its initial
public offering unless they are also willing to take the blame for the
stock’s performance in the longer term. Many Internet IPOs rose 1,000%
or more in 1999 and early 2000; most of them lost more than 95% in the
subsequent three years. How could these early gains earned by a few
investors justify the massive destruction of wealth suffered by the
millions who came later? Many IPOs were, in fact, deliberately
underpriced to “manufacture” immediate gains that would attract more
attention for the next offering.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first four sentences of Graham’s paragraph could read as the
official epitaph of the Internet and telecommunications bubble that
burst in early 2000. Just as the Surgeon General’s warning on the side
of a cigarette pack does not stop everyone from lighting up, no
regulatory reform will ever prevent investors from overdosing on their
own greed. (Not even Communism can outlaw market bubbles; the Chinese
stock market shot up 101.7% in the first half of 1999, then crashed.)
Nor can investment banks ever be entirely cleansed of their own
compulsion to sell any stock at any price the market will bear. The
circle can only be broken one investor, and one financial adviser, at a
time. Mastering Graham’s principles (see especially Chapters 1, 8, and
20) is the best way to start.</li>

<p>3 When accounting for acquisitions, loading up on WOOPIPRAD enabled
Tyco to reduce the portion of the purchase price that it allocated to
goodwill. Since WOOPIPRAD can be expensed up front, while goodwill
(under the accounting rules then in force) had to be written off over
multi-year periods, this maneuver enabled Tyco to minimize the impact of
goodwill charges on its future earnings.</p>
<p>4 In 2002, Tyco’s former chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, was
charged by state and Federal legal authorities with income tax fraud and
improperly diverting Tyco’s corporate assets for his own use, including
the appropriation of 5,000 for an umbrella stand and ,000 for a shower
curtain. Kozlowski denied all charges.</p>
<p>5 Disclosure: Jason Zweig is an employee of Time Inc., formerly a

<p>1 eToys’ prospectus had a gatefold cover featuring an original
cartoon of Arthur the aardvark, showing in comic style how much easier
it would be to buy tchotchkes for children at eToys than at a
traditional toy store. As analyst Gail Bronson of IPO Monitor told the
Associated Press on the day of eToys’ stock offering, “eToys has very,
very smartly managed the development of the company last year and
positioned themselves to be the children’s center of the Internet.”
Added Bronson: “The key to a successful IPO, especially a dot-com IPO,
is good marketing and branding.” Bronson was partly right: That’s the
key to a successful IPO for the issuing company and its bankers.
Unfortunately, for investors the key to a successful IPO is earnings,
which eToys didn’t have.</p>

<li>Here Graham is describing Real Estate Investment Trust, which was
acquired by San Francisco Real Estate Investors in 1983 for 0 a share.
The next paragraph describes Realty Equities Corp. of New York.</li>
</ul>
<p>† The actor Paul Newman was briefly a major shareholder in Realty
Equities Corp. of New York after it bought his movie-production company,
Kayos, Inc., in 1969.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Graham, an avid reader of poetry, is quoting Thomas Gray’s “Elegy
Written in a Country Churchyard.”</p></li>
<li><p>Realty Equities was delisted from the American Stock Exchange in
September 1973. In 1974, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
sued Realty Equities’ accountants for fraud. Realty Equities’ founder,
Morris Karp, later pleaded guilty to one count of grand larceny. In
1974–1975, the overindebtedness that Graham criticizes led to a
financial crisis among large banks, including Chase Manhattan, that had
lent heavily to the most aggressive realty trusts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† “Heteroclite” is a technical term from classical Greek that Graham
uses to mean abnormal or unusual.</p>
<ul>
<li>By “volume,” Graham is referring to sales or revenues—the total
dollar amount of each company’s business.</li>
</ul>
<p>† “Asset backing” and book value are synonyms. In Table 18-2, the
relationship of price to asset or book value can be seen by dividing the
first line (“Price, December 31, 1969”) by “Book value per share.”</p>
<p>† †Graham is citing his research on value stocks, which he discusses
in Chapter 15 (see p. 389). Since Graham completed his studies, a vast
body of scholarly work has confirmed that value stocks outperform growth
stocks over long periods. (Much of the best research in modern finance
simply provides independent confirmation of what Graham demonstrated
decades ago.) See, for instance, James L. Davis, Eugene F. Fama, and
Kenneth R. French, “Characteristics, Covariances, and Average Returns:
1929–1997,” at http://papers.ssrn.com.</p>
<ul>
<li>Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., still exists as a publicly-traded
stock and is included in the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock
index. Air Reduction Co. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of The BOC
Group (then known as British Oxygen) in 1978.</li>
</ul>
<p>† You can determine profitability, as measured by return on sales and
return on capital, by referring to the “Ratios” section of Table 18-3.
“Net/sales” measures return on sales; “Earnings/book value” measures
return on capital.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>American Home Products Co. is now known as Wyeth; the stock is
included in the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index. American
Hospital Supply Co. was acquired by Baxter Healthcare Corp. in
1985.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nearly 30 times” is reflected in the entry of 2920% under
“Price/book value” in the Ratios section of Table 18-4. Graham would
have shaken his head in astonishment during late 1999 and early 2000,
when many high-tech companies sold for hundreds of times their asset
value (see the commentary on this chapter). Talk about “almost unheard
of in the annals of serious stock-market valuations”! H andandandand R
Block remains a publicly-traded company, while Blue Bell was taken
private in 1984 at 7.50 per share.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is alerting readers to a form of the “gambler’s fallacy,”
in which investors believe that an overvalued stock must drop in price
purely because it is overvalued. Just as a coin does not become more
likely to turn up heads after landing on tails for nine times in a row,
so an overvalued stock (or stock market!) can stay overvalued for a
surprisingly long time. That makes short-selling, or betting that stocks
will drop, too risky for mere mortals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† International Harvester was the heir to McCormick Harvesting
Machine Co., the manufacturer of the McCormick reaper that helped make
the midwestern states the “breadbasket of the world.” But International
Harvester fell on hard times in the 1970s and, in 1985, sold its
farm-equipment business to Tenneco. After changing its name to Navistar,
the remaining company was booted from the Dow in 1991 (although it
remains a member of the S andandandand P 500 index). International
Flavors andandandand Fragrances, also a constituent of the S
andandandand P 500, had a total stock-market value of billion in early
2003, versus .6 billion for Navistar.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For more of Graham’s thoughts on shareholder activism, see the
commentary on Chapter 19. In criticizing Harvester for its refusal to
maximize shareholder value, Graham uncannily anticipated the behavior of
the company’s future management. In 2001, a majority of shareholders
voted to remove Navistar’s restrictions against outside takeover
bids—but the board of directors simply refused to implement the
shareholders’ wishes. It’s remarkable that an antidemocratic tendency in
the culture of some companies can endure for decades.</p></li>
<li><p>McGraw-Hill remains a publicly-traded company that owns, among
other operations, BusinessWeek magazine and Standard andandandand Poor’s
Corp. McGraw–Edison is now a division of Cooper Industries.</p></li>
<li><p>In “the May 1970 debacle” that Graham refers to, the U.S. stock
market lost 5.5%. From the end of March to the end of June 1970, the S
andandandand P 500 index lost 19% of its value, one of the worst
three-month returns on record.</p></li>
<li><p>National Presto remains a publicly-traded company. National
General was acquired in 1974 by another controversial conglomerate,
American Financial Group, which at various times has had interests in
cable television, banking, real estate, mutual funds, insurance, and
bananas. AFG is also the final resting place of some of the assets of
Penn Central Corp. (see Chapter 17).</p></li>
<li><p>Whiting Corp. ended up a subsidiary of Wheelabrator-Frye, but was
taken private in 1983. Willcox andandandand Gibbs is now owned by Group
Rexel, an electrical-equipment manufacturer that is a division of
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute Group of France. Rexel’s shares trade on the
Paris Stock Exchange.</p></li>

<p>1 Ask yourself which company’s stock would be likely to rise more:
one that discovered a cure for a rare cancer, or one that discovered a
new way to dispose of a common kind of garbage. The cancer cure sounds
more exciting to most investors, but a new way to get rid of trash would
probably make more money. See Paul Slovic, Melissa Finucane, Ellen

<p>11 All stock prices for Red Hat are adjusted for its two-for-one

<p>12 Ironically, 65 years earlier Graham had singled out Brown Shoe as
one of the most stable companies on the New York Stock Exchange. See the
1934 edition of Security Analysis, p. 159.</p>
<p>13 We use a nine-month period only because Red Hat’s 12-month results
could not be determined from its financial statements without including
the results of acquisitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ironically, takeovers began drying up shortly after Graham’s last
revised edition appeared, and the 1970s and early 1980s marked the
absolute low point of modern American industrial efficiency. Cars were
“lemons,” televisions and radios were constantly “on the fritz,” and the
managers of many publicly-traded companies ignored both the present
interests of their outside shareholders and the future prospects of
their own businesses. All of this began to change in 1984, when
independent oilman T. Boone Pickens launched a hostile takeover bid for
Gulf Oil. Soon, fueled by junk-bond financing provided by Drexel Burnham
Lambert, “corporate raiders” stalked the landscape of corporate America,
scaring long-sclerotic companies into a new regimen of efficiency. While
many of the companies involved in buy-outs and takeovers were ravaged,
the rest of American business emerged both leaner (which was good) and
meaner (which sometimes was not).</p></li>
<li><p>The irony that Graham describes here grew even stronger in the
1990s, when it almost seemed that the stronger the company was, the less
likely it was to pay a dividend—or for its shareholders to want one. The
“payout ratio” (or the percentage of their net income that companies
paid out as dividends) dropped from “60% to 75%” in Graham’s day to 35%
to 40% by the end of the 1990s.</p></li>
<li><p>In the late 1990s, technology companies were particularly strong
advocates of the view that all of their earnings should be “plowed back
into the business,” where they could earn higher returns than any
outside shareholder possibly could by reinvesting the same cash if it
were paid out to him or her in dividends. Incredibly, investors never
questioned the truth of this patronizing Daddy-Knows-Best principle—or
even realized that a company’s cash belongs to the shareholders, not its
managers. See the commentary on this chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Superior Oil’s stock price peaked at 165 per share in 1959, when
it paid a dividend. For many years, Superior was the highest-priced
stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Superior, controlled by the
Keck family of Houston, was acquired by Mobil Corp. in 1984.</p></li>
<li><p>Today, virtually all stock splits are carried out by a change in
value. In a two-for-one split, one share becomes two, each trading at
half the former price of the original single share; in a three-for-one
split, one share becomes three, each trading at a third of the former
price; and so on. Only in very rare cases is a sum transferred “from
earned surplus to capital account,” as in Graham’s day.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Rule 703 of the New York Stock Exchange governs stock splits and
stock dividends. The NYSE now designates stock dividends of greater than
25% and less than 100% as “partial stock splits.” Unlike in Graham’s
day, these stock dividends may now trigger the NYSE’s accounting
requirement that the amount of the dividend be capitalized from retained
earnings.</p>
<ul>
<li>This policy, already unusual in Graham’s day, is extremely rare
today. In 1936 and again in 1950, roughly half of all stocks on the NYSE
paid a so-called special dividend. By 1970, however, that percentage had
declined to less than 10% and, by the 1990s, was well under 5%. See
Harry DeAngelo, Linda DeAngelo, and Douglas J. Skinner, “Special
Dividends and the Evolution of Dividend Signaling,” Journal of Financial
Economics, vol. 57, no. 3, September, 2000, pp. 309–354. The most
plausible explanation for this decline is that corporate managers became
uncomfortable with the idea that shareholders might interpret special
dividends as a signal that future profits might be low.</li>
</ul>
<p>† The academic criticism of dividends was led by Merton Miller and
Franco Modigliani, whose influential article “Dividend Policy, Growth,
and the Valuation of Shares” (1961) helped win them Nobel Prizes in
Economics. Miller and Modigliani argued, in essence, that dividends were
irrelevant, since an investor should not care whether his return comes
through dividends and a rising stock price, or through a rising stock
price alone, so long as the total return is the same in either case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graham’s argument is no longer valid, and today’s investors can
safely skip over this passage. Shareholders no longer need to worry
about “having to break up” a stock certificate, since virtually all
shares now exist in electronic rather than paper form. And when Graham
says that a 5% increase in a cash dividend on 100 shares is less
“probable” than a constant dividend on 105 shares, it’s unclear how he
could even calculate that probability.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Subscription rights, often simply known as “rights,” are used less
frequently than in Graham’s day. They confer upon an existing
shareholder the right to buy new shares, sometimes at a discount to
market price. A shareholder who does not participate will end up owning
proportionately less of the company. Thus, as is the case with so many
other things that go by the name of “rights,” some coercion is often
involved. Rights are most common today among closed-end funds and
insurance or other holding companies.</p>
<ul>
<li>The administration of President George W. Bush made progress in
early 2003 toward reducing the problem of double-taxation of corporate
dividends, although it is too soon to know how helpful any final laws in
this area will turn out to be. A cleaner approach would be to make
dividend payments tax-deductible to the corporation, but that is not
part of the proposed legislation.</li>
</ul>
<p>1 Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor (Harper andandandand Row,
New York,1949), pp. 217, 219, 240. Graham explains his reference to
Jesus this way: “In at least four parables in the Gospels there is
reference to a highly critical relationship between a man of wealth and
those he puts in charge of his property. Most to the point are the words
that “a certain rich man” speaks to his steward or manager, who is
accused of wasting his goods: ‘Give an account of thy stewardship, for
thou mayest be no longer steward.’ (Luke, 16:2).” Among the other
parables Graham seems to have in mind is Matt., 25:15–28.</p>
<p>2 Benjamin Graham, “A Questionnaire on Stockholder-Management
Relationship,” The Analysts Journal, Fourth Quarter, 1947, p. 62. Graham
points out that he had conducted a survey of nearly 600 professional
security analysts and found that more than 95% of them believed that
shareholders have the right to call for a formal investigation of
managers whose leadership does not enhance the value of the stock.
Graham adds dryly that “such action is almost unheard of in practice.”
This, he says, “highlights the wide gulf between what should happen and
what does happen in shareholder-management relationships.”</p>
<p>3 Graham and Dodd, Security Analysis (1934 ed.), p. 508.</p>
<p>4 The Intelligent Investor, 1949 edition, p. 218.</p>
<p>5 1949 edition, p. 223. Graham adds that a proxy vote would be
necessary to authorize an independent committee of outside shareholders
to select “the engineering firm” that would submit its report to the
shareholders, not to the board of directors. However, the company would
bear the costs of this project. Among the kinds of “engineering firms”
Graham had in mind were money managers, rating agencies and
organizations of security analysts. Today, investors could choose from
among hundreds of consulting firms, restructuring advisers, and members
of entities like the Risk Management Association.</p>
<p>6 Tabulations of voting results for 2002 by Georgeson Shareholder and
ADP’s Investor Communication Services, two leading firms that mail proxy
solicitations to investors, suggest response rates that average around
80% to 88% (including proxies sent in by stockbrokers on behalf of their
clients, which are automatically voted in favor of management unless the
clients specify otherwise). Thus the owners of between 12% and 20% of
all shares are not voting their proxies. Since individuals own only 40%
of U.S. shares by market value, and most institutional investors like
pension funds and insurance companies are legally bound to vote on proxy
issues, that means that roughly a third of all individual investors are
neglecting to vote.</p>

Table 1; see also Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton, Triumph
of the Optimists (Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, 2002), pp. 158–161.
Interestingly, the total dollar amount of dividends paid by U.S. stocks
has risen since the late 1970s, even after inflation—but the number of
stocks that pay a dividend has shrunk by nearly two-thirds. See Harry
DeAngelo, Linda DeAngelo, and Douglas J. Skinner, “Are Dividends

<p>10 Perhaps Benjamin Franklin, who is said to have carried his coins
around in an asbestos purse so that money wouldn’t burn a hole in his
pocket, could have avoided this problem if he had been a CEO.</p>
<p>11 A study by BusinessWeek found that from 1995 through 2001, 61% out
of more than 300 large mergers ended up destroying wealth for the
shareholders of the acquiring company—a condition known as “the winner’s
curse” or “buyer’s remorse.” And acquirers using stock rather than cash
to pay for the deal underperformed rival companies by 8%. (David Henry,
“Mergers: Why Most Big Deals Don’t Pay Off,” BusinessWeek, October 14,
2002, pp. 60–70.) A similar academic study found that acquisitions of
private companies and subsidiaries of public companies lead to positive
stock returns, but that acquisitions of entire public companies generate
losses for the winning bidder’s shareholders. (Kathleen Fuller, Jeffry
Netter, and Mike Stegemoller, “What Do Returns to Acquiring Firms Tell
Us?” The Journal of Finance, vol. 57, no. 4, August, 2002,
pp. 1763–1793.)</p>
<p>12 With interest rates near record lows, such a mountain of cash
produces lousy returns if it just sits around. As Graham asserts, “So
long as this surplus cash remains with the company, the outside
stockholder gets little benefit from it” (1949 edition, p. 232). Indeed,
by year-end 2002, Microsoft’s cash balance had swollen to 3.4
billion—clear proof that the company could find no good use for the cash
its businesses were generating. As Graham would say, Microsoft’s
operations were efficient, but its finance no longer was. In a step
toward redressing this problem, Microsoft declared in early 2003 that it
would begin paying a regular quarterly dividend.</p>

Nissim-Ziv findings on future earnings agree that dividend increases
lead to higher future stock returns; see Shlomo Benartzi, Roni Michaely,
and Richard Thaler, “Do Changes in Dividends Signal the Future or the
Past?” The Journal of Finance, vol. 52, no. 3, July, 1997,
pp. 1007–1034.</p>
<p>15 The tax reforms proposed by President George W. Bush in early 2003
would change the taxability of dividends, but the fate of this
legislation was not yet clear by press time.</p>
<p>16 Historically, companies took a common-sense approach toward share
repurchases, reducing them when stock prices were high and stepping them
up when prices were low. After the stock market crash of October 19,
1987, for example, 400 companies announced new buybacks over the next 12
days alone—while only 107 firms had announced buyback programs in the
earlier part of the year, when stock prices had been much higher. See
Murali Jagannathan, Clifford P. Stephens, and Michael S. Weisbach,
“Financial Flexibility and the Choice Between Dividends and Stock
Repurchases,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 57, no. 3, September,
2000, p. 362.</p>
<p>17 The stock options granted by a company to its executives and
employees give them the right (but not the obligation) to buy shares in
the future at a discounted price. That conversion of options to shares
is called “exercising” the options. The employees can then sell the
shares at the current market price and pocket the difference as profit.
Because hundreds of millions of options may be exercised in a given
year, the company must increase its supply of shares outstanding. Then,
however, the company’s total net income would be spread across a much
greater number of shares, reducing its earnings per share. Therefore,
the company typically feels compelled to buy back other shares to cancel
out the stock issued to the option holders. In 1998, 63.5% of chief
financial officers admitted that counteracting the dilution from options
was a major reason for repurchasing shares (see CFO Forum, “The Buyback
Track,” Institutional Investor, July, 1998).</p>
<p>18 One of the main factors driving this change was the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision, in 1982, to relax its
previous restrictions on share repurchases. See Gustavo Grullon and Roni
Michaely, “Dividends, Share Repurchases, and the Substitution
Hypothesis,” The Journal of Finance, vol. 57, no. 4, August, 2002,
pp. 1649–1684.</p>
<p>19 Throughout his writings, Graham insists that corporate managements
have a duty not just to make sure their stock is not undervalued, but
also to make sure it never gets overvalued. As he put it in Security
Analysis (1934 ed., p. 515), “the responsibility of managements to act
in the interest of their shareholders includes the obligation to
prevent—in so far as they are able—the establishment of either absurdly
high or unduly low prices for their securities.” Thus, enhancing
shareholder value doesn’t just mean making sure that the stock price
does not go too low; it also means ensuring that the stock price does
not go up to unjustifiable levels. If only the executives of Internet
companies had heeded Graham’s wisdom back in 1999!</p>
<p>20 Incredibly, although options are considered a compensation expense
on a company’s tax returns, they are not counted as an expense on the
income statement in financial reports to shareholders. Investors can
only hope that accounting reforms will change this ludicrous
practice.</p>
<p>21 See George W. Fenn and Nellie Liang, “Corporate Payout Policy and
Managerial Stock Incentives,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 60,
no. 1, April, 2001, pp. 45–72. Dividends make stocks less volatile by
providing a stream of current income that cushions shareholders against
fluctuations in market value. Several researchers have found that the
average profitability of companies with stock-buyback programs (but no
cash dividends) is at least twice as volatile as that of companies that
pay dividends. Those more variable earnings will, in general, lead to
bouncier share prices, making the managers’ stock options more
valuable—by creating more opportunities when share prices will be
temporarily high. Today, about two-thirds of executive compensation
comes in the form of options and other noncash awards; thirty years ago,
at least two-thirds of compensation came as cash.</p>

<li><p>By the late 1990s, this advice—which can be appropriate for a
foundation or endowment with an infinitely long investment horizon—had
spread to individual investors, whose life spans are finite. In the 1994
edition of his influential book, Stocks for the Long Run, finance
professor Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton School recommended that
“risk-taking” investors should buy on margin, borrowing more than a
third of their net worth to sink 135% of their assets into stocks. Even
government officials got in on the act: In February 1999, the Honorable
Richard Dixon, state treasurer of Maryland, told the audience at an
investment conference: “It doesn’t make any sense for anyone to have any
money in a bond fund.”</p></li>
<li><p>This is one of Graham’s rare misjudgments. In 1973, just two
years after President Richard Nixon imposed wage and price controls,
inflation hit 8.7%, its highest level since the end of World War II. The
decade from 1973 through 1982 was the most inflationary in modern
American history, as the cost of living more than doubled.</p></li>
<li><p>See p. 25.</p></li>
<li><p>John Pierpont Morgan was the most powerful financier of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Because of his vast influence,
he was constantly asked what the stock market would do next. Morgan
developed a mercifully short and unfailingly accurate answer: “It will
fluctuate.” See Jean Strouse, Morgan: American Financier (Random House,
1999), p. 11.</p></li>
<li><p>The investment philosopher Peter L. Bernstein feels that Graham
was “dead wrong” about precious metals, particularly gold, which (at
least in the years after Graham wrote this chapter) has shown a robust
ability to out-pace inflation. Financial adviser William Bernstein
agrees, pointing out that a tiny allocation to a precious-metals fund
(say, 2% of your total assets) is too small to hurt your overall returns
when gold does poorly. But, when gold does well, its returns are often
so spectacular—sometimes exceeding 100% in a year—that it can, all by
itself, set an otherwise lackluster portfolio glittering. However, the
intelligent investor avoids investing in gold directly, with its high
storage and insurance costs; instead, seek out a well-diversified mutual
fund specializing in the stocks of precious-metal companies and charging
below 1% in annual expenses. Limit your stake to 2% of your total
financial assets (or perhaps 5% if you are over the age of 65).</p></li>

<p>2 For a lively discussion of the “inflation is dead” scenario, see
www.pbs. org/newshour/bb/economy/july-dec97/inflation_12-16.html. In
1996, the Boskin Commission, a group of economists asked by the
government to investigate whether the official rate of inflation is
accurate, estimated that it has been overstated, often by nearly two
percentage points per year. For the commission’s report, see
www.ssa.gov/history/reports/boskinrpt.html. Many investment experts now
feel that deflation, or falling prices, is an even greater threat than
inflation; the best way to hedge against that risk is by including bonds
as a permanent component of your portfolio. (See the commentary on
Chapter 4.)</p>

<p>4 That year, President Jimmy Carter gave his famous “malaise” speech,
in which he warned of “a crisis in confidence” that “strikes at the very
heart and soul and spirit of our national will” and “threatens to
destroy the social and the political fabric of America.”</p>
<p>5 See Stanley Fischer, Ratna Sahay, and Carlos A. Vegh, “Modern
Hyper- and High Inflations,” National Bureau of Economic Research,

<p>6 In fact, the United States has had two periods of hyperinflation.
During the American Revolution, prices roughly tripled every year from
1777 through 1779, with a pound of butter costing 2 and a barrel of
flour fetching nearly ,600 in Revolutionary Massachusetts. During the
Civil War, inflation raged at annual rates of 29% (in the North) and
nearly 200% (in the Confederacy). As recently as 1946, inflation hit
18.1% in the United States.</p>
<p>7 I am indebted to Laurence Siegel of the Ford Foundation for this
cynical, but accurate, insight. Conversely, in a time of deflation (or
steadily falling prices) it’s more advantageous to be a lender than a
borrower—which is why most investors should keep at least a small
portion of their assets in bonds, as a form of insurance against
deflating prices.</p>
<p>8 When inflation is negative, it is technically termed “deflation.”
Regularly falling prices may at first sound appealing, until you think
of the Japanese example. Prices have been deflating in Japan since 1989,
with real estate and the stock market dropping in value year after
year—a relentless water torture for the world’s second-largest
economy.</p>

pattern is evident outside the United States: In Belgium, Italy, and
Germany, where inflation was especially high in the twentieth century,
“inflation appears to have had a negative impact on both stock and bond
markets,” note Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton in Triumph of
the Optimists: 101 Years of Global Investment Returns (Princeton

invent him a sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and
appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: ‘
And this, too, shall pass away.’ How much it expresses! How chastening

<li><p>“Earning power” is Graham’s term for a company’s potential
profits or, as he puts it, the amount that a firm “might be expected to
earn year after year if the business conditions prevailing during the
period were to continue unchanged” (Security Analysis, 1934 ed.,
p. 354). Some of his lectures make it clear that Graham intended the
term to cover periods of five years or more. You can crudely but
conveniently approximate a company’s earning power per share by taking
the inverse of its price/earnings ratio; a stock with a P/E ratio of 11
can be said to have earning power of 9% (or 1 divided by 11). Today
“earning power” is often called “earnings yield.”</p></li>
<li><p>This problem is discussed extensively in the commentary on
Chapter 19.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham elegantly summarized the discussion that follows in a
lecture he gave in 1972: “The margin of safety is the difference between
the percentage rate of the earnings on the stock at the price you pay
for it and the rate of interest on bonds, and that margin of safety is
the difference which would absorb unsatisfactory developments. At the
time the 1965 edition of The Intelligent Investor was written the
typical stock was selling at 11 times earnings, giving about 9% return
as against 4% on bonds. In that case you had a margin of safety of over
100 per cent. Now 〔in 1972〕 there is no difference between the
earnings rate on stocks and the interest rate on stocks, and I say there
is no margin of safety…you have a negative margin of safety on stocks…”
See “Benjamin Graham: Thoughts on Security Analysis” 〔transcript of
lecture at the Northeast Missouri State University business school,
March, 1972〕, Financial History, no. 42, March, 1991, p. 9.</p></li>
<li><p>This paragraph—which Graham wrote in early 1972—is an uncannily
precise description of market conditions in early 2003. (For more
detail, see the commentary on Chapter 3.)</p></li>
<li><p>In “American” roulette, most wheels include 0 and 00 along with
numbers 1 through 36, for a total of 38 slots. The casino offers a
maximum payout of 35 to 1. What if you bet on every number? Since only
one slot can be the one into which the ball drops, you would win 5 on
that slot, but lose on each of your other 37 slots, for a net loss of .
That difference (or a 5.26% spread on your total 8 bet) is the casino’s
“house advantage,” ensuring that, on average, roulette players will
always lose more than they win. Just as it is in the roulette player’s
interest to bet as seldom as possible, it is in the casino’s interest to
keep the roulette wheel spinning. Likewise, the intelligent investor
should seek to maximize the number of holdings that offer “a better
chance for profit than for loss.” For most investors, diversification is
the simplest and cheapest way to widen your margin of safety.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is saying that there is no such thing as a good or bad
stock; there are only cheap stocks and expensive stocks. Even the best
company becomes a “sell” when its stock price goes too high, while the
worst company is worth buying if its stock goes low enough.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† The very people who considered technology and telecommunications
stocks a “sure thing” in late 1999 and early 2000, when they were
hellishly overpriced, shunned them as “too risky” in 2002—even though,
in Graham’s exact words from an earlier period, “the price depreciation
of about 90% made many of these securities exceedingly attractive and
reasonably safe.” Similarly, Wall Street’s analysts have always tended
to call a stock a “strong buy” when its price is high, and to label it a
“sell” after its price has fallen—the exact opposite of what Graham (and
simple common sense) would dictate. As he does throughout the book,
Graham is distinguishing speculation—or buying on the hope that a
stock’s price will keep going up—from investing, or buying on the basis
of what the underlying business is worth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graham uses “common-stock option warrant” as a synonym for
“warrant,” a security issued directly by a corporation giving the holder
a right to purchase the company’s stock at a predetermined price.
Warrants have been almost entirely superseded by stock options. Graham
quips that he intends the example as a “shocker” because, even in his
day, warrants were regarded as one of the market’s seediest backwaters.

<p>† The “price/earnings ratio” of a stock, or of a market average like
the S andandandand P 500-stock index, is a simple tool for taking the
market’s temperature. If, for instance, a company earned per share of
net income over the past year, and its stock is selling at .93 per
share, its price/earnings ratio would be 8.93; if, however, the stock is
selling at 9.70, then the price/earnings ratio would be 69.7. In
general, a price/earnings ratio (or “P/E” ratio) below 10 is considered
low, between 10 and 20 is considered moderate, and greater than 20 is
considered expensive. (For more on P/E ratios, see p. 168.)</p>
<p>1 If dividends are not included, stocks fell 47.8% in those two
years.</p>
<p>1 By the 1840s, these indexes had widened to include a maximum of
seven financial stocks and 27 railroad stocks—still an absurdly
unrepresentative sample of the rambunctious young American stock
market.</p>
<p>2 See Jason Zweig, “New Cause for Caution on Stocks,” Time, May 6,
2002, p. 71. As Graham hints on p. 65, even the stock indexes between
1871 and the 1920s suffer from survivorship bias, thanks to the hundreds
of automobile, aviation, and radio companies that went bust without a
trace. These returns, too, are probably overstated by one to two
percentage points.</p>
<p>2 Those cheaper stock prices do not mean, of course, that investors’
expectation of a 7% stock return will be realized.</p>

research of owning “junk bonds.” See the commentary on Chapter 6 for

</ul>
<p>† † The “New Housing” bonds and “New Community debentures” are no
more. New Housing Authority bonds were backed by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and were exempt from income tax, but
they have not been issued since 1974. New Community debentures, also
backed by HUD, were authorized by a Federal law passed in 1968. About 50
million of these debentures were issued through 1975, but the program
was terminated in 1983.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A bond’s “coupon” is its interest rate; a “low-coupon” bond pays
a rate of interest income below the market average.</p></li>
<li><p>While Graham’s logic remains valid, the numbers have changed.
Corporations can currently deduct 70% of the income they receive from
dividends, and the standard corporate tax rate is 35%. Thus, a
corporation would pay roughly 4.50 in tax on 00 in dividends from
preferred stock versus 5 in tax on 00 in interest income. Individuals
pay the same rate of income tax on dividend income that they do on
interest income, so preferred stock offers them no tax
advantage.</p></li>

www.investinginbonds. com/cgi-bin/calculator.pl and
www.lebenthal.com/index_infocenter.html. To decide if a “muni” is right
for you, find the “taxable equivalent yield” generated by these
calculators, then compare that number to the yield currently available
on Treasury bonds (http://money.cnn.com/markets/bondcenter/ or
www.bloomberg.com/markets/C13.html). If the yield on Treasury bonds is
higher than the taxable equivalent yield, munis are not for you. In any
case, be warned that municipal bonds and funds produce lower income, and
more price fluctuation, than most taxable bonds. Also, the alternative
minimum tax, which now hits many middle-income Americans, can negate the
advantages of municipal bonds.</p>

<p>11 In general, variable annuities are not attractive for investors
under the age of 50 who expect to be in a high tax bracket during
retirement or who have not already contributed the maximum to their
existing 401(k) or IRA accounts. Fixed annuities (with the notable
exception of those from TIAA-CREF) can change their “guaranteed” rates
and smack you with nasty surrender fees. For thorough and objective
analysis of annuities, see two superb articles by Walter Updegrave:

<ul>
<li>At the beginning of 1949, the average annual return produced by
stocks over the previous 20 years was 3.1%, versus 3.9% for long-term
Treasury bonds—meaning that 0,000 invested in stocks would have grown to
8,415 over that period, while the same amount in bonds would have turned
into 1,494. Naturally enough, 1949 turned out to be a fabulous time to
buy stocks: Over the next decade, the Standard andandandand Poor’s
500-stock index gained an average of 20.1% per year, one of the best
long-term returns in the history of the U.S. stock market.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Graham’s earlier comments on this subject appear on pp. 19–20. Just
imagine what he would have thought about the stock market of the late
1990s, in which each new record-setting high was considered further
“proof” that stocks were the riskless way to wealth!</p>
<ul>
<li>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a then-record high of
381.17 on September 3, 1929. It did not close above that level until
November 23, 1954—more than a quarter of a century later—when it hit
382.74. (When you say you intend to own stocks “for the long run,” do
you realize just how long the long run can be—or that many investors who
bought in 1929 were no longer even alive by 1954?) However, for patient
investors who reinvested their income, stock returns were positive over
this otherwise dismal period, simply because dividend yields averaged
more than 5.6% per year. According to professors Elroy Dimson, Paul
Marsh, and Mike Staunton of London Business School, if you had invested
in U.S. stocks in 1900 and spent all your dividends, your stock
portfolio would have grown to 98 by 2000. But if you had reinvested all
your dividends, your stock portfolio would have been worth 6,797! Far
from being an afterthought, dividends are the greatest force in stock
investing.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Why do the “high prices” of stocks affect their dividend yields? A
stock’s yield is the ratio of its cash dividend to the price of one
share of common stock. If a company pays a annual dividend when its
stock price is 00 per share, its yield is 2%. But if the stock price
doubles while the dividend stays constant, the dividend yield will drop
to 1%. In 1959, when the trend Graham spotted in 1957 became noticeable
to everyone, most Wall Street pundits declared that it could not
possibly last. Never before had stocks yielded less than bonds; after
all, since stocks are riskier than bonds, why would anyone buy them at
all unless they pay extra dividend income to compensate for their
greater risk? The experts argued that bonds would outyield stocks for a
few months at most, and then things would revert to “normal.” More than
four decades later, the relationship has never been normal again; the
yield on stocks has (so far) continuously stayed below the yield on
bonds.</p>
<ul>
<li>See pp. 56–57 and 88–89.</li>
</ul>
<p>† For another view of diversification, see the sidebar in the
commentary on Chapter 14 (p. 368).</p>
<ul>
<li>Today’s defensive investor should probably insist on at least 10
years of continuous dividend payments (which would eliminate from
consideration only one member of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average—Microsoft—and would still leave at least 317 stocks to choose
from among the S andandandand P 500 index). Even insisting on 20 years
of uninterrupted dividend payments would not be overly restrictive;
according to Morgan Stanley, 255 companies in the S andandandand P 500
met that standard as of year-end 2002.</li>
</ul>
<p>† The “Rule of 72” is a handy mental tool. To estimate the length of
time an amount of money takes to double, simply divide its assumed
growth rate into 72. At 6%, for instance, money will double in 12 years
(72 divided by 6 = 12). At the 7.1% rate cited by Graham, a growth stock
will double its earnings in just over 10 years (72/7.1 = 10.1
years).</p>
<ul>
<li>Graham makes this point on p. 73.</li>
</ul>
<p>† To show that Graham’s observations are perennially true, we can
substitute Microsoft for IBM and Cisco for Texas Instruments. Thirty
years apart, the results are uncannily similar: Microsoft’s stock
dropped 55.7% from 2000 through 2002, while Cisco’s stock—which had
risen roughly 50-fold over the previous six years—lost 76% of its value
from 2000 through 2002. As with Texas Instruments, the drop in Cisco’s
stock price was sharper than the fall in its earnings, which dropped
just 39.2% (comparing the three-year average for 1997–1999 against
2000–2002). As always, the hotter they are, the harder they fall.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Earnings multiplier” is a synonym for P/E or price/earnings ratios,
which measure how much investors are willing to pay for a stock compared
to the profitability of the underlying business. (See footnote † on

</ul>
<p>† Investors can now set up their own automated system to monitor the
quality of their holdings by using interactive “portfolio trackers” at
such websites as www.quicken.com, moneycentral.msn.com,
finance.yahoo.com, and www.morningstar.com. Graham would, however, warn
against relying exclusively on such a system; you must use your own
judgment to supplement the software.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To update Graham’s figures, take each dollar amount in this
section and multiply it by five.</p></li>

a total stock value (or “market capitalization”) of at least 0 billion.

2002, Landis’s fund (full of technology companies that he claimed to

<p>5 According to finance professor Charles Jones of Columbia Business
School, the cost of a small, one-way trade (either a buy or a sell) in a
New York Stock Exchange–listed stock dropped from about 1.25% in
Graham’s day to about 0.25% in 2000. For institutions like mutual funds,
those costs are actually higher. (See Charles M. Jones, “A Century of
Stock Market Liquidity and Trading Costs,” at

<li><p>Here Graham has made a slip of the tongue. After insisting in
Chapter 1 that the definition of an “enterprising” investor depends not
on the amount of risk you seek, but the amount of work you are willing
to put in, Graham falls back on the conventional notion that
enterprising investors are more “aggressive.” The rest of the chapter,
however, makes clear that Graham stands by his original definition. (The
great British economist John Maynard Keynes appears to have been the
first to use the term “enterprise” as a synonym for analytical
investment.)</p></li>
<li><p>“High-coupon issues” are corporate bonds paying above-average
interest rates (in today’s markets, at least 8%) or preferred stocks
paying large dividend yields (10% or more). If a company must pay high
rates of interest in order to borrow money, that is a fundamental signal
that it is risky. For more on high-yield or “junk” bonds, see
pp. 145–147.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† As of early 2003, the equivalent yields are roughly 5.1% on
high-grade corporate bonds and 4.7% on 20-year tax-free municipal bonds.
To update these yields, see www.bondsonline.com/asp/news/composites/html
or www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates.html and www.bloomberg.com/markets/

<ul>
<li><p>For a recent example that painfully reinforces Graham’s point,
see p. 146 below.</p></li>
<li><p>Bond prices are quoted in percentages of “par value,” or 100. A
bond priced at “85” is selling at 85% of its principal value; a bond
originally offered for 0,000, but now selling at 85, will cost ,500.
When bonds sell below 100, they are called “discount” bonds; above 100,
they become “premium” bonds.</p></li>
<li><p>New issues of common stock—initial public offerings or
IPOs—normally are sold with an “underwriting discount” (a built-in
commission) of 7%. By contrast, the buyer’s commission on older shares
of common stock typically ranges below 4%. Whenever Wall Street makes
roughly twice as much for selling something new as it does for selling
something old, the new will get the harder sell.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Recently, finance professors Owen Lamont of the University of
Chicago and Paul Schultz of the University of Notre Dame have shown that
corporations choose to offer new shares to the public when the stock
market is near a peak. For technical discussion of these issues, see
Lamont’s “Evaluating Value Weighting: Corporate Events and Market
Timing” and Schultz’s “Pseudo Market Timing and the Long-Run Performance
of IPOs” at http:// papers.ssrn.com.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the two years from June 1960, through May 1962, more than 850
companies sold their stock to the public for the first time—an average
of more than one per day. In late 1967 the IPO market heated up again;
in 1969 an astonishing 781 new stocks were born. That oversupply helped
create the bear markets of 1969 and 1973–1974. In 1974 the IPO market
was so dead that only nine new stocks were created all year; 1975 saw
only 14 stocks born. That undersupply, in turn, helped feed the bull
market of the 1980s, whenroughly 4,000 new stocks flooded the
market—helping to trigger the over-enthusiasm that led to the 1987
crash. Then the cycle swung the other way again as IPOs dried up in
1988–1990. That shortage contributed to the bull market of the
1990s—and, right on cue, Wall Street got back into the business of
creating new stocks, cranking out nearly 5,000 IPOs. Then, after the
bubble burst in 2000, only 88 IPOs were issued in 2001—the lowest annual
total since 1979. In every case, the public has gotten burned on IPOs,
has stayed away for at least two years, but has always returned for
another scalding. For as long as stock markets have existed, investors
have gone through this manic-depressive cycle. In America’s first great
IPO boom, back in 1825, a man was said to have been squeezed to death in
the stampede of speculators trying to buy shares in the new Bank of
Southwark; the wealthiest buyers hired thugs to punch their way to the
front of the line. Sure enough, by 1829, stocks had lost roughly 25% of
their value.</p></li>
<li><p>Here Graham is describing rights offerings, in which investors
who already own a stock are asked to pony up even more money to maintain
the same proportional interest in the company. This form of financing,
still widespread in Europe, has become rare in the United States, except
among closed-end funds.</p></li>
<li><p>In Graham’s day, the most prestigious investment banks generally
steeredclear of the IPO business, which was regarded as an undignified
exploitation of naïve investors. By the peak of the IPO boom in late
1999 and early 2000, however, Wall Street’s biggest investment banks had
jumped in with both feet. Venerable firms cast off their traditional
prudence and behaved like drunken mud wrestlers, scrambling to foist
ludicrously overvalued stocks on a desperately eager public. Graham’s
description of how the IPO process works is a classic that should be
required reading in investment-banking ethics classes, if there are
any.</p></li>

invisible—misleading investors into believing that their trading costs
are insignificant if commission costs are low. The costs of trading
NASDAQ stocks are considerably higher for individuals than the costs of
trading NYSE-listed stocks (see p. 128, footnote 5).</p>

<p>† Today these “lower-quality bonds” in the “special situation” area
are known as distressed or defaulted bonds. When a company is in
approaching) bankruptcy, its common stock becomes essentially worthless,
since U.S. bankruptcy law entitles bondholders to a much stronger legal
claim than shareholders. But if the company reorganizes successfully and
comes out of bankruptcy, the bondholders often receive stock in the new
firm, and the value of the bonds usually recovers once the company is
able to pay interest again. Thus the bonds of a troubled company can
perform almost as well as the common stock of a healthy company. In
these special situations, as Graham puts it, “no true distinction exists
between bonds and common stocks.”(or</p>
<ul>
<li>Note very carefully what Graham is saying here. Writing in 1972, he
contends that the period since 1949—a stretch of more than 22 years—is
too short a period from which to draw reliable conclusions! With his
mastery of mathematics, Graham never forgets that objective conclusions
require very long samples of large amounts of data. The charlatans who
peddle “time-tested” stock-picking gimmicks almost always base their
findings on smaller samples than Graham would ever accept. (Graham often
used 50-year periods to analyze past data.)</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Over the 10 years ending December 31, 2002, funds investing in
large growth companies—today’s equivalent of what Graham calls “growth
funds”—earned an annual average of 5.6%, underperforming the overall
stock market by an average of 3.7 percentage points per year. However,
“large value” funds investing in more reasonably priced big companies
also underperformed the market over the same period (by a full
percentage point per year). Is the problem merely that growth funds
cannot reliably select stocks that will outperform the market in the
future? Or is it that the high costs of running the average fund
(whether it buys growth or “value” companies) exceed any extra return
the managers can earn with their stock picks? To update fund performance
by type, see www.morningstar.com, “Category Returns.” For an
enlightening reminder of how perishable the performance of different
investment styles can be, see www.callan.com/resource/periodic_
table/pertable.pdf.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham makes this point to remind you that an “enterprising”
investor is not one who takes more risk than average or who buys
“aggressive growth” stocks; an enterprising investor is simply one who
is willing to put in extra time and effort in researching his or her
portfolio.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Notice that Graham insists on calculating the price/earnings ratio
based on a multiyear average of past earnings. That way, you lower the
odds that you will overestimate a company’s value based on a temporarily
high burst of profitability. Imagine that a company earned per share
over the past 12 months, but an average of only 50 cents per share over
the previous six years. Which number—the sudden or the steady 50
cents—is more likely to represent a sustainable trend? At 25 times the
it earned in the most recent year, the stock would be priced at 5. But
at 25 times the average earnings of the past seven years ( in total
earnings, divided by seven, equals 85.7 cents per share in average
annual earnings), the stock would be priced at only 1.43. Which number
you pick makes a big difference. Finally, it’s worth noting that the
prevailing method on Wall Street today—basing price/earnings ratios
primarily on “next year’s earnings”—would be anathema to Graham. How can
you value a company based on earnings it hasn’t even generated yet?
That’s like setting house prices based on a rumor that Cinderella will
be building her new castle right around the corner.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recent examples hammer Graham’s point home. On September 21,
2000, Intel Corp., the maker of computer chips, announced that it
expected its revenues to grow by up to 5% in the next quarter. At first
blush, that sounds great; most big companies would be delighted to
increase their sales by 5% in just three months. But in response,
Intel’s stock dropped 22%, a one-day loss of nearly 1 billion in total
value. Why? Wall Street’s analysts had expected Intel’s revenue to rise
by up to 10%. Similarly, on February 21, 2001, EMC Corp., a data-storage
firm, announced that it expected its revenues to grow by at least 25% in
2001—but that a new caution among customers “may lead to longer selling
cycles.” On that whiff of hesitation, EMC’s shares lost 12.8% of their
value in a single day.</p></li>
<li><p>Today’s equivalent of investors “who have a close relationship
with the particular company” are so-called control persons—senior
managers or directors who help run the company and own huge blocks of
stock. Executives like Bill Gates of Microsoft or Warren Buffett of
Berkshire Hathaway have direct control over a company’s destiny—and
outside investors want to see these chief executives maintain their
large shareholdings as a vote of confidence. But less-senior managers
and rank-and-file workers cannot influence the company’s share price
with their individual decisions; thus they should not put more than a
small percentage of their assets in their own employer’s stock. As for
outside investors, no matter how well they think they know the company,
the same objection applies.</p></li>

<li><p>Among the steepest of the mountains recently made out of
molehills: In May 1998, Pfizer Inc. and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration announced that six men taking Pfizer’s anti-impotence
drug Viagra had died of heart attacks while having sex. Pfizer’s stock
immediately went flaccid, losing 3.4% in a single day on heavy trading.
But Pfizer’s shares surged ahead when research later showed that there
was no cause for alarm; the stock gained roughly a third over the next
two years. In late 1997, shares of Warner-Lambert Co. fell by 19% in a
day when sales of its new diabetes drug were temporarily halted in
England; within six months, the stock had nearly doubled. In late 2002,
Carnival Corp., which operates cruise ships, lost roughly 10% of its
value after tourists came down with severe diarrhea and vomiting—on
ships run by other companies.</p></li>
<li><p>By “net working capital,” Graham means a company’s current assets
(such as cash, marketable securities, and inventories) minus its total
liabilities (including preferred stock and long-term debt).</p></li>
<li><p>From 1975 through 1983, small (“secondary”) stocks outperformed
large stocks by an amazing average of 17.6 percentage points per year.
The investing public eagerly embraced small stocks, mutual fund
companies rolled out hundreds of new funds specializing in them, and
small stocks obliged by underperforming large stocks by five percentage
points per year over the next decade. The cycle recurred in 1999, when
small stocks beat big stocks by nearly nine percentage points, inspiring
investment bankers to sell hundreds of hot little high-tech stocks to
the public for the first time. Instead of “electronics,” “computers,” or
“franchise” in their names, the new buzzwords were “.com,” “optical,”
“wireless,” and even prefixes like “e-” and “I-.” Investing buzzwords
always turn into buzz saws, tearing apart anyone who believes in
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Defaulted railroad bonds do not offer significant opportunities
today. However, as already noted, distressed and defaulted junk bonds,
as well as convertible bonds issued by high-tech companies, may offer
real value in the wake of the 2000–2002 market crash. But
diversification in this area is essential—and impractical without at
least 00,000 to dedicate to distressed securities alone. Unless you are
a millionaire several times over, this kind of diversification is not an
option.</p></li>
<li><p>A classic recent example is Philip Morris, whose stock lost 23%
in two days after a Florida court authorized jurors to consider punitive
damages of up to 00 billion against the company—which had finally
admitted that cigarettes may cause cancer. Within a year, Philip
Morris’s stock had doubled—only to fall back after a later
multibillion-dollar judgment in Illinois. Several other stocks have been
virtually destroyed by liability lawsuits, including Johns Manville, W.
R. Grace, and USG Corp. Thus, “never buy into a lawsuit” remains a valid
rule for all but the most intrepid investors to live by.</p></li>

<p>11 In the late 1990s, the forecasts of “market strategists” became
more influential than ever before. They did not, unfortunately, become
more accurate. On March 10, 2000, the very day that the NASDAQ composite
index hit its all-time high of 5048.62, Prudential Securities’s chief
technical analyst Ralph Acampora said in USA Today that he expected
NASDAQ to hit 6000 within 12 to 18 months. Five weeks later, NASDAQ had
already shriveled to 3321.29—but Thomas Galvin, a market strategist at
Donaldson, Lufkin andandandand Jenrette, declared that “there’s only 200
or 300 points of downside for the NASDAQ and 2000 on the upside.” It
turned out that there were no points on the upside and more than 2000 on
the downside, as NASDAQ kept crashing until it finally scraped bottom on
October 9, 2002, at 1114.11. In March 2001, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief
investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs andandandand Co., predicted that
the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index would close the year at
1,650 and that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would finish 2001 at
13,000. “We do not expect a recession,” said Cohen, “and believe that
corporate profits are likely to grow at close to trend growth rates
later this year.” The U.S. economy was sinking into recession even as
she spoke, and the S andandandand P 500 ended 2001 at 1148.08, while the
Dow finished at 10,021.50—30% and 23% below her forecasts,
respectively.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>See p. 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Without bear markets to take stock prices back down, anyone
waiting to “buy low” will feel completely left behind—and, all too
often, will end up abandoning any former caution and jumping in with
both feet. That’s why Graham’s message about the importance of emotional
discipline is so important. From October 1990 through January 2000, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average marched relentlessly upward, never losing
more than 20% and suffering a loss of 10% or more only three times. The
total gain (not counting dividends): 395.7%. According to Crandall,
Pierce andandandand Co., this was the second-longest uninterrupted bull
market of the past century; only the 1949–1961 boom lasted longer. The
longer a bull market lasts, the more severely investors will be
afflicted with amnesia; after five years or so, many people no longer
believe that bear markets are even possible. All those who forget are
doomed to be reminded; and, in the stock market, recovered memories are
always unpleasant.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham discusses this “recommended policy” in Chapter 4
(pp. 89–91). This policy, now called “tactical asset allocation,” is
widely followed by institutional investors like pension funds and
university endowments.</p></li>
<li><p>Many of these “formula planners” would have sold all their stocks
at the end of 1954, after the U.S. stock market rose 52.6%, the
second-highest yearly return then on record. Over the next five years,
these market-timers would likely have stood on the sidelines as stocks
doubled.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Easy ways to make money in the stock market fade for two reasons:
the natural tendency of trends to reverse over time, or “regress to the
mean,” and the rapid adoption of the stock-picking scheme by large
numbers of people, who pile in and spoil all the fun of those who got
there first. (Note that, in referring to his “discomfiting experience,”
Graham is—as always—honest in admitting his own failures.) See Jason
Zweig, “Murphy Was an Investor,” Money, July, 2002, pp. 61–62, and Jason
Zweig, “New Year’s Play,” Money, December, 2000, pp. 89–90.</p>

<li>Today’s equivalent of what Graham calls “second-line companies”
would be any of the thousands of stocks not included in the Standard
andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index. A regularly revised list of the 500
stocks in the S andandandand P index is available at
www.standardandpoors.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Note carefully what Graham is saying here. It is not just possible,
but probable, that most of the stocks you own will gain at least 50%
from their lowest price and lose at least 33% from their highest
price—regardless of which stocks you own or whether the market as a
whole goes up or down. If you can’t live with that—or you think your
portfolio is somehow magically exempt from it—then you are not yet
entitled to call yourself an investor. (Graham refers to a 33% decline
as the “equivalent one-third” because a 50% gain takes a 0 stock to 5.
From 5, a 33% loss 〔or drop〕 takes it right back to 0, where it
started.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For today’s investor, the ideal strategy for pursuing this
“formula” is rebalancing, which we discuss on pp. 104–105.</p></li>
<li><p>Most companies today provide “an engraved stock certificate” only
upon special request. Stocks exist, for the most part, in purely
electronic form (much as your bank account contains computerized credits
and debits, not actual currency) and thus have become even easier to
trade than they were in Graham’s day.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Net asset value, book value, balance-sheet value, and
tangible-asset value are all synonyms for net worth, or the total value
of a company’s physical and financial assets minus all its liabilities.
It can be calculated using the balance sheets in a company’s annual and
quarterly reports; from total shareholders’ equity, subtract all “soft”
assets such as goodwill, trademarks, and other intangibles. Divide by
the fully diluted number of shares outstanding to arrive at book value
per share.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Graham’s use of the word “paradox” is probably an allusion to a
classic article by David Durand, “Growth Stocks and the Petersburg
Paradox,” The Journal of Finance, vol. XII, no. 3, September, 1957,
pp. 348–363, which compares investing in high-priced growth stocks to
betting on a series of coin flips in which the payoff escalates with
each flip of the coin. Durand points out that if a growth stock could
continue to grow at a high rate for an indefinite period of time, an
investor should (in theory) be willing to pay an infinite price for its
shares. Why, then, has no stock ever sold for a price of infinity
dollars per share? Because the higher the assumed future growth rate,
and the longer the time period over which it is expected, the wider the
margin for error grows, and the higher the cost of even a tiny
miscalculation becomes. Graham discusses this problem further in
Appendix 4(p. 570).</p></li>
<li><p>The more recent history of A andandandand P is no different. At
year-end 1999, its share price was 7.875; at year-end 2000, .00; a year
later, 3.78; at year-end 2002, .06. Although some accounting
irregularities later came to light at A andandandand P, it defies all
logic to believe that the value of a relatively stable business like
groceries could fall by three-fourths in one year, triple the next year,
then drop by two-thirds the year after that.</p></li>
<li><p>“Only to the extent that it suits his book” means “only to the
extent that the price is favorable enough to justify selling the stock.”
In traditional brokerage lingo, the “book” is an investor’s ledger of
holdings and trades.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† This may well be the single most important paragraph in Graham’s
entire book. In these 113 words Graham sums up his lifetime of
experience. You cannot read these words too often; they are like
Kryptonite for bear markets. If you keep them close at hand and let them
guide you throughout your investing life, you will survive whatever the
markets throw at you.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Graham has much more to say on what is now known as “corporate
governance.” See the commentary on Chapter 19.</p></li>
<li><p>By what Graham called “the rule of opposites,” in 2002 the yields
on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds hit their lowest levels since 1963.
Since bond yields move inversely to prices, those low yields meant that
prices had risen—making investors most eager to buy just as bonds were
at their most expensive and as their future returns were almost
guaranteed to be low. This provides another proof of Graham’s lesson
that the intelligent investor must refuse to make decisions based on
market fluctuations.</p></li>
<li><p>An updated analysis for today’s readers, explaining recent yields
and the wider variety of bonds and bond funds available today, can be
found in the commentary on Chapter 4.</p></li>
<li><p>As mentioned in the commentary on Chapters 2 and 4, Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are a new and improved version
of what Graham is suggesting here.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1 See Graham’s text, pp. 204–205.</p>
<p>2 As Graham noted in a classic series of articles in 1932, the Great
Depression caused the shares of dozens of companies to drop below the
value of their cash and other liquid assets, making them “worth more
dead than alive.”</p>
<p>3 News release, The Spectrem Group, “Plan Sponsors Are Losing the
Battle to Prevent Declining Participation and Deferrals into Defined
Contribution Plans,” October 25, 2002.</p>
<p>4 A few months later, on March 10, 2000—the very day that NASDAQ hit
its all-time high—online trading pundit James J. Cramer wrote that he
had “repeatedly” been tempted in recent days to sell Berkshire Hathaway
short, a bet that Buffett’s stock had farther to fall. With a vulgar
thrust of his rhetorical pelvis, Cramer even declared that Berkshire’s
shares were “ripe for the banging.” That same day, market strategist
Ralph Acampora of Prudential Securities asked, “Norfolk Southern or
Cisco Systems: Where do you want to be in the future?” Cisco, a key to
tomorrow’s Internet superhighway, seemed to have it all over Norfolk
Southern, part of yesterday’s railroad system. (Over the next year,
Norfolk Southern gained 35%, while Cisco lost 70%.)</p>
<p>5 When asked what keeps most individual investors from succeeding,
Graham had a concise answer: “The primary cause of failure is that they
pay too much attention to what the stock market is doing currently.” See
“Benjamin Graham: Thoughts on Security Analysis” 〔transcript of lecture
at Northeast Missouri State University Business School, March, 1972〕,
Financial History magazine, no. 42, March, 1991, p. 8.</p>
<p>6 Never mind what these terms mean, or are supposed to mean. While in
public these classifications are treated with the utmost respect, in
private most people in the investment business regard them with the
contempt normally reserved for jokes that aren’t funny.</p>

<p>9 The neuroscience of investing is explored in Jason Zweig, “Are You

<p>10 It’s also worth asking whether you could enjoy living in your
house if its market price was reported to the last penny every day in
the newspapers and on TV.</p>
<p>11 In a series of remarkable experiments in the late 1980s, a
psychologist at Columbia and Harvard, Paul Andreassen, showed that
investors who received frequent news updates on their stocks earned half
the returns of investors who got no news at all. See Jason Zweig,
“Here’s How to Use the News and Tune Out the Noise,” Money, July, 1998,
pp. 63–64.</p>
<p>12 Federal tax law is subject to constant change. The example of
Coca-Cola stock given here is valid under the provisions of the U.S. tax
code as it stood in early 2003.</p>
<p>13 This example assumes that the investor had no realized capital
gains in 2002 and did not reinvest any Coke dividends. Tax swaps are not
to be undertaken lightly, since they can be mishandled easily. Before
doing a tax swap, read IRS Publication 550
(www.irs.gov/pub/irspdf/p550.pdf). A good guide to managing your
investment taxes is Robert N. Gordon with Jan M. Rosen, Wall Street
Secrets for Tax-Efficient Investing (Bloomberg Press, Princeton, New
Jersey, 2001). Finally, before you pull the trigger, consult a
professional tax adviser.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a violation of Federal law for an open-end mutual fund, a
closed-end fund, or an exchange-traded fund to sell shares to the public
unless it has “registered” (or made mandatory financial filings) with
the SEC.</li>
</ul>
<p>† The fund industry has gone from “very large” to immense. At
year-end 2002, there were 8,279 mutual funds holding .56 trillion; 514
closed-end funds with 49.6 billion in assets; and 116 exchange-trade
funds or ETFs with 09.7 billion. These figures exclude such fund-like
investments as variable annuities and unit investment trusts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lists of the major types of mutual funds can be found at
www.ici.org/ pdf/g2understanding.pdf and
http://news.morningstar.com/fundReturns/ CategoryReturns.html.
Letter-stock funds no longer exist, while hedge funds are generally
banned by SEC rules from selling shares to any investor whose annual
income is below 00,000 or whose net worth is below million.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Today, the maximum sales load on a stock fund tends to be around
5.75%. If you invest 0,000 in a fund with a flat 5.75% sales load, 75
will go to the person (and brokerage firm) that sold it to you, leaving
you with an initial net investment of ,425. The 75 sales charge is
actually 6.1% of that amount, which is why Graham calls the standard way
of calculating the charge a “sales gimmick.” Since the 1980s, no-load
funds have become popular, and they no longer tend to be smaller than
load funds.</p>
<p>† Nearly every mutual fund today is taxed as a “regulated investment
company,” or RIC, which is exempt from corporate income tax so long as
it pays out essentially all of its income to its shareholders. In the
“option” that Graham omits “to avoid clutter,” a fund can ask the SEC
for special permission to distribute one of its holdings directly to the
fund’s shareholders—as his Graham-Newman Corp. did in 1948, parceling
out shares in GEICO to Graham-Newman’s own investors. This sort of
distribution is extraordinarily rare.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dual-purpose funds, popular in the late 1980s, have essentially
disappeared from the marketplace—a shame, since they offered investors a
more flexible way to take advantage of the skills of great stock pickers
like John Neff. Perhaps the recent bear market will lead to a
renaissance of this attractive investment vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<p>† “Performance funds” were all the rage in the late 1960s. They were
equivalent to the aggressive growth funds of the late 1990s, and served
their investors no better.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For periods as long as 10 years, the returns of the Dow and the S
andandandand P 500 can diverge by fairly wide margins. Over the course
of the typical investing lifetime, however—say 25 to 50 years—their
returns have tended to converge quite closely.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the “doomed companies” Graham refers to was National
Student Marketing Corp., a con game masquerading as a stock, whose saga
was told brilliantly in Andrew Tobias’s The Funny Money Game (Playboy
Press, New York, 1971). Among the supposedly sophisticated investors who
were snookered by NSM’s charismatic founder, Cort Randell, were the
endowment funds of Cornell and Harvard and the trust departments at such
prestigious banks as Morgan Guaranty and Bankers Trust.</p></li>
<li><p>As only the latest proof that “the more things change, the more
they stay the same,” consider that Ryan Jacob, a 29-year-old boy wonder,
launched the Jacob Internet Fund at year-end 1999, after producing a
216% return at his previous dot-com fund. Investors poured nearly 00
million into Jacob’s fund in the first few weeks of 2000. It then
proceeded to lose 79.1% in 2000, 56.4% in 2001, and 13% in 2002—a
cumulative collapse of 92%. That loss may have made Mr. Jacob’s
investors even older and wiser than it made him.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Intriguingly, the disastrous boom and bust of 1999–2002 also came
roughly 35 years after the previous cycle of insanity. Perhaps it takes
about 35 years for the investors who remember the last “New Economy”
craze to become less influential than those who do not. If this
intuition is correct, the intelligent investor should be particularly
vigilant around the year 2030.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today’s equivalent of Graham’s “scarce exceptions” tend to be
open-end funds that are closed to new investors—meaning that the
managers have stopped taking in any more cash. While that reduces the
management fees they can earn, it maximizes the returns their existing
shareholders can earn. Because most fund managers would rather look out
for No. 1 than be No. 1, closing a fund to new investors is a rare and
courageous step.</li>
</ul>
<p>1 See Jason Zweig, “Did You Beat the Market?” Money, January, 2000,
pp. 55–58; Time /CNN poll #15, October 25–26, 2000, question 29.</p>
<p>1 Sector funds specializing in almost every imaginable industry are
available—and date back to the 1920s. After nearly 80 years of history,
the evidence is overwhelming: The most lucrative, and thus most popular,
sector of any given year often turns out to be among the worst
performers of the following year. Just as idle hands are the devil’s
workshop, sector funds are the investor’s nemesis.</p>

<p>3 That’s not to say that these funds would have done better if their
“super-star” managers had stayed in place; all we can be sure of is that
the two funds did poorly without them.</p>
<p>4 There’s a second lesson here: To succeed, the individual investor
must either avoid shopping from the same list of favorite stocks that
have already been picked over by the giant institutions, or own them far
more patiently. See Erik R. Sirri and Peter Tufano, “Costly Search and
Mutual Fund Flows,” The Journal of Finance, vol. 53, no. 8, October,
1998, pp. 1589–1622; Keith C. Brown, W. V. Harlow, and Laura Starks, “Of

investors, both institutional and individual, will find that the best
way to own common stocks is through an index fund that charges minimal
fees. Those following this path are sure to beat the net results (after
fees and expenses) delivered by the great majority of investment
professionals.” (See www.berkshirehathaway. com/1996ar/1996.html.)</p>

<p>11 Unlike a mutual fund, a closed-end fund does not issue new shares
directly to anyone who wants to buy them. Instead, an investor must buy
shares not from the fund itself, but from another shareholder who is
willing to part with them. Thus, the price of the shares fluctuates
above and below their net asset value, depending on supply and
demand.</p>

stock commissions when you buy and sell them—and these commissions are
often assessed on any additional purchases or reinvested dividends.

government, invested aggressively for wealthy clients. For a superb

<p>5 Constance Loizos, “QandandandandA: Alex Cheung,” InvestmentNews,
May 17, 1999, p. 38. The highest 20-year return in mutual fund history
was 25.8% per year, achieved by the legendary Peter Lynch of Fidelity
Magellan over the two decades ending December 31, 1994. Lynch’s
performance turned 0,000 into more than 82,000 in 20 years. Cheung was
predicting that his fund would turn 0,000 into more than million over
the same length of time. Instead of regarding Cheung as ridiculously
overoptimistic, investors threw money at him, flinging more than 00
million into his fund over the next year. A 0,000 investment in the
Monument Internet Fund in May 1999 would have shrunk to roughly ,000 by
year-end 2002. (The Monument fund no longer exists in its original form
and is now known as Orbitex Emerging Technology Fund.)</p>
<p>6 Lisa Reilly Cullen, “The Triple Digit Club,” Money, December, 1999,
p. 170. If you had invested 0,000 in Vilar’s fund at the end of 1999,
you would have finished 2002 with just ,195 left—one of the worst
destructions of wealth in the history of the mutual-fund industry.</p>
<p>7 See www.thestreet.com/funds/smarter/891820.html. Cramer’s favorite
stocks did not go “higher consistently in good days and bad.” By
year-end 2002, one of the 10 had already gone bankrupt, and a 0,000
investment spread equally across Cramer’s picks would have lost 94%,
leaving you with a grand total of 97.44. Perhaps Cramer meant that his
stocks would be “winners” not in “the new world,” but in the world to
come.</p>
<p>8 The only exception to this rule is an investor in the advanced
stage of retirement, who may not be able to outlast a long bear market.
Yet even an elderly investor should not sell her stocks merely because
they have gone down in price; that approach not only turns her paper
losses into real ones but deprives her heirs of the potential to inherit
those stocks at lower costs for tax purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Raskob (1879–1950) was a director of Du Pont, the giant chemical
company, and chairman of the finance committee at General Motors. He
also served as national chairman of the Democratic Party and was the
driving force behind the construction of the Empire State Building.
Calculations by finance professor Jeremy Siegel confirm that Raskob’s
plan would have grown to just under ,000 after 20 years, although
inflation would have eaten away much of that gain. For the best recent
look at Raskob’s views on long-term stock investing, see the essay by
financial adviser William Bernstein at
www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/197/raskob.htm.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham’s “brief discussion” is in two parts, on p. 33 and
pp. 191–192. For more detail on the Dow Theory, see
http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/ dow/dowpage.html.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Mutual funds bought “letter stock” in private transactions, then
immediately revalued these shares at a higher public price (see Graham’s
definition on p. 579). That enabled these “go-go” funds to report
unsustainably high returns in the mid-1960s. The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission cracked down on this abuse in 1969, and it is no
longer a concern for fund investors. Stock-option warrants are explained
in Chapter 16.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Penn Central Transportation Co., then the biggest railroad in
the United States, sought bankruptcy protection on June 21,
1970—shocking investors, who had never expected such a giant company to
go under (see. 423). Among the companies with “excessive” debt Graham
had in mind were Ling-Temco-Vought and National General Corp. (see
pp. 425 and 463). The “problem of solvency” on Wall Street emerged
between 1968 and 1971, when several prestigious brokerages suddenly went
bust.</p></li>
<li><p>See Chapter 2. As of the beginning of 2003, U.S. Treasury bonds
maturing in 10 years yielded 3.8%, while stocks (as measured by the Dow
Jones Industrial Average) yielded 1.9%. (Note that this relationship is
not all that different from the 1964 figures that Graham cites.) The
income generated by top-quality bonds has been falling steadily since
1981.</p></li>
<li><p>“Air-transport stocks,” of course, generated as much excitement
in the late 1940s and early 1950s as Internet stocks did a half century
later. Among the hottest mutual funds of that era were Aeronautical
Securities and the Missiles-Rockets-Jets andandandand Automation Fund.
They, like the stocks they owned, turned out to be an investing
disaster. It is commonly accepted today that the cumulative earnings of
the airline industry over its entire history have been negative. The
lesson Graham is driving at is not that you should avoid buying airline
stocks, but that you should never succumb to the “certainty” that any
industry will outperform all others in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Tangible assets include a company’s physical property (like real
estate, factories, equipment, and inventories) as well as its financial
balances (such as cash, short-term investments, and accounts
receivable). Among the elements not included in tangible assets are
brands, copyrights, patents, franchises, goodwill, and trademarks. To
see how to calculate tangible-asset value, see footnote † on
