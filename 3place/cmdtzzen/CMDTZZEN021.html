<p>“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment</p>
<p>In the old legend the wise men finally boiled down the history of
mortal affairs into the single phrase, “This too will pass.”* Confronted
with a like challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into
three words, we venture the motto, MARGIN OF SAFETY. This is the thread
that runs through all the preceding discussion of investment
policy—often explicitly, sometimes in a less direct fashion. Let us try
now, briefly, to trace that idea in a connected argument.</p>
<p>All experienced investors recognize that the margin-of-safety concept
is essential to the choice of sound bonds and preferred stocks. For
example, a railroad should have earned its total fixed charges better
than five times (before income tax), taking a period of years, for its
bonds to qualify as investment-grade issues. This past ability to earn
in excess of interest requirements constitutes the margin of safety that
is counted on to protect the investor against loss or discomfiture in
the event of some future decline in net income. (The margin above
charges may be stated in other ways— for example, in the percentage by
which revenues or profits may decline before the balance after interest
disappears—but the underlying idea remains the same.)</p>
<p>The bond investor does not expect future average earnings to work out
the same as in the past; if he were sure of that, the margin demanded
might be small. Nor does he rely to any controlling extent on his
judgment as to whether future earnings will be materially better or
poorer than in the past, if he did that, he would have to measure his
margin in terms of a carefully projected income account, instead of
emphasizing the margin shown in the past record. Here the function of
the margin of safety is, in essence, that of rendering unnecessary an
accurate estimate of the future. If the margin is a large one, then it
is enough to assume that future earnings will not fall far below those
of the past in order for an investor to feel sufficiently protected
against the vicissitudes of time.</p>
<p>The margin of safety for bonds may be calculated, alternatively, by
comparing the total value of the enterprise with the amount of debt. (A
similar calculation may be made for a preferred-stock issue.) If the
business owes 0 million and is fairly worth 0 million, there is room for
a shrinkage of two-thirds in value—at least theoretically—before the
bondholders will suffer loss. The amount of this extra value, or
“cushion,” above the debt may be approximated by using the average
market price of the junior stock issues over a period of years. Since
average stock prices are generally related to average earning power, the
margin of “enterprise value” over debt and the margin of earnings over
charges will in most cases yield similar results.</p>
<p>So much for the margin-of-safety concept as applied to “fixed-value
investments.” Can it be carried over into the field of common stocks?
Yes, but with some necessary modifications.</p>
<p>There are instances where a common stock may be considered sound
because it enjoys a margin of safety as large as that of a good bond.
This will occur, for example, when a company has outstanding only common
stock that under depression conditions is selling for less than the
amount of bonds that could safely be issued against its property and
earning power.* That was the position of a host of strongly financed
industrial companies at the low price levels of 1932–33. In such
instances the investor can obtain the margin of safety associated with a
bond, plus all the chances of larger income and principal appreciation
inherent in a common stock. (The only thing he lacks is the legal power
to insist on dividend payments “or else”—but this is a small drawback as
compared with his advantages.) Common stocks bought under such
circumstances will supply an ideal, though infrequent, combination of
safety and profit opportunity. As a quite recent example of this
condition, let us mention once more National Presto Industries stock,
which sold for a total enterprise value of 3 million in 1972. With its 6
millions of recent earnings before taxes the company could easily have
supported this amount of bonds.</p>
<p>In the ordinary common stock, bought for investment under normal
conditions, the margin of safety lies in an expected earning power
considerably above the going rate for bonds. In former editions we
elucidated this point with the following figures:</p>
<p>Assume in a typical case that the earning power is 9% on the price
and that the bond rate is 4%; then the stockbuyer will have an average
annual margin of 5% accruing in his favor. Some of the excess is paid to
him in the dividend rate; even though spent by him, it enters into his
overall investment result. The undistributed balance is reinvested in
the business for his account. In many cases such reinvested earnings
fail to add commensurately to the earning power and value of his stock.
(That is why the market has a stubborn habit of valuing earnings
disbursed in dividends more generously than the portion retained in the
business.)* But, if the picture is viewed as a whole, there is a
reasonably close connection between the growth of corporate surpluses
through reinvested earnings and the growth of corporate values.</p>
<p>Over a ten-year period the typical excess of stock earning power over
bond interest may aggregate 50% of the price paid. This figure is
sufficient to provide a very real margin of safety—which, under
favorable conditions, will prevent or minimize a loss. If such a margin
is present in each of a diversified list of twenty or more stocks, the
probability of a favorable result under “fairly normal conditions”
becomes very large. That is why the policy of investing in
representative common stocks does not require high qualities of insight
and foresight to work out successfully. If the purchases are made at the
average level of the market over a span of years, the prices paid should
carry with them assurance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to
investors lies in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of
the market, or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more
than average risk of diminished earning power.</p>
<p>As we see it, the whole problem of common-stock investment under 1972
conditions lies in the fact that “in a typical case” the earning power
is now much less than 9% on the price paid.* Let us assume that by
concentrating somewhat on the low-multiplier issues among the large
companies a defensive investor may now acquire equities at 12 times
recent earnings—i.e., with an earnings return of 8.33% on cost. He may
obtain a dividend yield of about 4%, and he will have 4.33% of his cost
reinvested in the business for his account. On this basis, the excess of
stock earning power over bond interest over a ten-year basis would still
be too small to constitute an adequate margin of safety. For that reason
we feel that there are real risks now even in a diversified list of
sound common stocks. The risks may be fully offset by the profit
possibilities of the list; and indeed the investor may have no choice
but to incur them—for otherwise he may run an even greater risk of
holding only fixed claims payable in steadily depreciating dollars.
Nonetheless the investor would do well to recognize, and to accept as
philosophically as he can, that the old package of good profit
possibilities combined with small ultimate risk is no longer available
to him.*</p>
<p>However, the risk of paying too high a price for good-quality
stocks—while a real one—is not the chief hazard confronting the average
buyer of securities. Observation over many years has taught us that the
chief losses to investors come from the purchase of low-quality
securities at times of favorable business conditions. The purchasers
view the current good earnings as equivalent to “earning power” and
assume that prosperity is synonymous with safety. It is in those years
that bonds and preferred stocks of inferior grade can be sold to the
public at a price around par, because they carry a little higher income
return or a deceptively attractive conversion privilege. It is then,
also, that common stocks of obscure companies can be floated at prices
far above the tangible investment, on the strength of two or three years
of excellent growth.</p>
<p>These securities do not offer an adequate margin of safety in any
admissible sense of the term. Coverage of interest charges and preferred
dividends must be tested over a number of years, including preferably a
period of subnormal business such as in 1970–71. The same is ordinarily
true of common-stock earnings if they are to qualify as indicators of
earning power. Thus it follows that most of the fair-weather
investments, acquired at fair-weather prices, are destined to suffer
disturbing price declines when the horizon clouds over—and often sooner
than that. Nor can the investor count with confidence on an eventual
recovery—although this does come about in some proportion of the
cases—for he has never had a real safety margin to tide him through
adversity.</p>
<p>The philosophy of investment in growth stocks parallels in part and
in part contravenes the margin-of-safety principle. The growth-stock
buyer relies on an expected earning power that is greater than the
average shown in the past. Thus he may be said to substitute these
expected earnings for the past record in calculating his margin of
safety. In investment theory there is no reason why carefully estimated
future earnings should be a less reliable guide than the bare record of
the past; in fact, security analysis is coming more and more to prefer a
competently executed evaluation of the future. Thus the growth-stock
approach may supply as dependable a margin of safety as is found in the
ordinary investment—provided the calculation of the future is
conservatively made, and provided it shows a satisfactory margin in
relation to the price paid.</p>
<p>The danger in a growth-stock program lies precisely here. For such
favored issues the market has a tendency to set prices that will not be
adequately protected by a conservative projection of future earnings.
(It is a basic rule of prudent investment that all estimates, when they
differ from past performance, must err at least slightly on the side of
understatement.) The margin of safety is always dependent on the price
paid. It will be large at one price, small at some higher price,
nonexistent at some still higher price. If, as we suggest, the average
market level of most growth stocks is too high to provide an adequate
margin of safety for the buyer, then a simple technique of diversified
buying in this field may not work out satisfactorily. A special degree
of foresight and judgment will be needed, in order that wise individual
selections may overcome the hazards inherent in the customary market
level of such issues as a whole.</p>
<p>The margin-of-safety idea becomes much more evident when we apply it
to the field of undervalued or bargain securities. We have here, by
definition, a favorable difference between price on the one hand and
indicated or appraised value on the other. That difference is the safety
margin. It is available for absorbing the effect of miscalculations or
worse than average luck. The buyer of bargain issues places particular
emphasis on the ability of the investment to withstand adverse
developments. For in most such cases he has no real enthusiasm about the
company’s prospects. True, if the prospects are definitely bad the
investor will prefer to avoid the security no matter how low the price.
But the field of undervalued issues is drawn from the many
concerns—perhaps a majority of the total—for which the future appears
neither distinctly promising nor distinctly unpromising. If these are
bought on a bargain basis, even a moderate decline in the earning power
need not prevent the investment from showing satisfactory results. The
margin of safety will then have served its proper purpose.</p>
<p>Theory of Diversification</p>
<p>There is a close logical connection between the concept of a safety
margin and the principle of diversification. One is correlative with the
other. Even with a margin in the investor’s favor, an individual
security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees only that he has
a better chance for profit than for loss—not that loss is impossible.
But as the number of such commitments is increased the more certain does
it become that the aggregate of the profits will exceed the aggregate of
the losses. That is the simple basis of the insurance-underwriting
business.</p>
<p>Diversification is an established tenet of conservative investment.
By accepting it so universally, investors are really demonstrating their
acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to which diversification
is the companion. This point may be made more colorful by a reference to
the arithmetic of roulette. If a man bets on a single number, he is paid
5 profit when he wins—but the chances are 37 to 1 that he will lose. He
has a “negative margin of safety.” In his case diversification is
foolish. The more numbers he bets on, the smaller his chance of ending
with a profit. If he regularly bets on every number (including 0 and
00), he is certain to lose on each turn of the wheel. But suppose the
winner received 9 profit instead of 5. Then he would have a small but
important margin of safety. Therefore, the more numbers he wagers on,
the better his chance of gain. And he could be certain of winning on
every spin by simply betting each on all the numbers. (Incidentally, the
two examples given actually describe the respective positions of the
player and proprietor of a wheel with 0 and 00.)*</p>
<p>A Criterion of Investment versus Speculation</p>
<p>Since there is no single definition of investment in general
acceptance, authorities have the right to define it pretty much as they
please. Many of them deny that there is any useful or dependable
difference between the concepts of investment and of speculation. We
think this skepticism is unnecessary and harmful. It is injurious
because it lends encouragement to the innate leaning of many people
toward the excitement and hazards of stock-market speculation. We
suggest that the margin-of-safety concept may be used to advantage as
the touchstone to distinguish an investment operation from a speculative
one.</p>
<p>Probably most speculators believe they have the odds in their favor
when they take their chances, and therefore they may lay claim to a
safety margin in their proceedings. Each one has the feeling that the
time is propitious for his purchase, or that his skill is superior to
the crowd’s, or that his adviser or system is trustworthy. But such
claims are unconvincing. They rest on subjective judgment, unsupported
by any body of favorable evidence or any conclusive line of reasoning.
We greatly doubt whether the man who stakes money on his view that the
market is heading up or down can ever be said to be protected by a
margin of safety in any useful sense of the phrase.</p>
<p>By contrast, the investor’s concept of the margin of safety—as
developed earlier in this chapter—rests upon simple and definite
arithmetical reasoning from statistical data. We believe, also, that it
is well supported by practical investment experience. There is no
guarantee that this fundamental quantitative approach will continue to
show favorable results under the unknown conditions of the future. But,
equally, there is no valid reason for pessimism on this score.</p>
<p>Thus, in sum, we say that to have a true investment there must be
present a true margin of safety. And a true margin of safety is one that
can be demonstrated by figures, by persuasive reasoning, and by
reference to a body of actual experience.</p>
<p>Extension of the Concept of Investment</p>
<p>To complete our discussion of the margin-of-safety principle we must
now make a further distinction between conventional and unconventional
investments. Conventional investments are appropriate for the typical
portfolio. Under this heading have always come United States government
issues and high-grade, dividend-paying common stocks. We have added
state and municipal bonds for those who will benefit sufficiently by
their tax-exempt features. Also included are first-quality corporate
bonds when, as now, they can be bought to yield sufficiently more than
United States savings bonds.</p>
<p>Unconventional investments are those that are suitable only for the
enterprising investor. They cover a wide range. The broadest category is
that of undervalued common stocks of secondary companies, which we
recommend for purchase when they can be bought at two-thirds or less of
their indicated value. Besides these, there is often a wide choice of
medium-grade corporate bonds and preferred stocks when they are selling
at such depressed prices as to be obtainable also at a considerable
discount from their apparent value. In these cases the average investor
would be inclined to call the securities speculative, because in his
mind their lack of a first-quality rating is synonymous with a lack of
investment merit.</p>
<p>It is our argument that a sufficiently low price can turn a security
of mediocre quality into a sound investment opportunity—provided that
the buyer is informed and experienced and that he practices adequate
diversification. For, if the price is low enough to create a substantial
margin of safety, the security thereby meets our criterion of
investment. Our favorite supporting illustration is taken from the field
of real-estate bonds. In the 1920s, billions of dollars’ worth of these
issues were sold at par and widely recommended as sound investments. A
large proportion had so little margin of value over debt as to be in
fact highly speculative in character. In the depression of the 1930s an
enormous quantity of these bonds defaulted their interest, and their
price collapsed—in some cases below 10 cents on the dollar. At that
stage the same advisers who had recommended them at par as safe
investments were rejecting them as paper of the most speculative and
unattractive type. But as a matter of fact the price depreciation of
about 90% made many of these securities exceedingly attractive and
reasonably safe—for the true values behind them were four or five times
the market quotation.*</p>
<p>The fact that the purchase of these bonds actually resulted in what
is generally called “a large speculative profit” did not prevent them
from having true investment qualities at their low prices. The
“speculative” profit was the purchaser’s reward for having made an
unusually shrewd investment. They could properly be called investment
opportunities, since a careful analysis would have shown that the excess
of value over price provided a large margin of safety. Thus the very
class of “fair-weather investments” which we stated above is a chief
source of serious loss to naïve security buyers is likely to afford many
sound profit opportunities to the sophisticated operator who may buy
them later at pretty much his own price.†</p>
<p>The whole field of “special situations” would come under our
definition of investment operations, because the purchase is always
predicated on a thoroughgoing analysis that promises a larger
realization than the price paid. Again there are risk factors in each
individual case, but these are allowed for in the calculations and
absorbed in the overall results of a diversified operation.</p>
<p>To carry this discussion to a logical extreme, we might suggest that
a defensible investment operation could be set up by buying such
intangible values as are represented by a group of “common-stock option
warrants” selling at historically low prices. (This example is intended
as somewhat of a shocker.)* The entire value of these warrants rests on
the possibility that the related stocks may some day advance above the
option price. At the moment they have no exercisable value. Yet, since
all investment rests on reasonable future expectations, it is proper to
view these warrants in terms of the mathematical chances that some
future bull market will create a large increase in their indicated value
and in their price. Such a study might well yield the conclusion that
there is much more to be gained in such an operation than to be lost and
that the chances of an ultimate profit are much better than those of an
ultimate loss. If that is so, there is a safety margin present even in
this unprepossessing security form. A sufficiently enterprising investor
could then include an option-warrant operation in his miscellany of
unconventional investments.1</p>
<p>To Sum Up</p>
<p>Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike. It is
amazing to see how many capable businessmen try to operate in Wall
Street with complete disregard of all the sound principles through which
they have gained success in their own undertakings. Yet every corporate
security may best be viewed, in the first instance, as an ownership
interest in, or a claim against, a specific business enterprise. And if
a person sets out to make profits from security purchases and sales, he
is embarking on a business venture of his own, which must be run in
accordance with accepted business principles if it is to have a chance
of success.</p>
<p>The first and most obvious of these principles is, “Know what you are
doing—know your business.” For the investor this means: Do not try to
make “business profits” out of securities—that is, returns in excess of
normal interest and dividend income—unless you know as much about
security values as you would need to know about the value of merchandise
that you proposed to manufacture or deal in.</p>
<p>A second business principle: “Do not let anyone else run your
business, unless (1) you can supervise his performance with adequate
care and comprehension or (2) you have unusually strong reasons for
placing implicit confidence in his integrity and ability.” For the
investor this rule should determine the conditions under which he will
permit someone else to decide what is done with his money.</p>
<p>A third business principle: “Do not enter upon an operation—that is,
manufacturing or trading in an item—unless a reliable calculation shows
that it has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit. In particular,
keep away from ventures in which you have little to gain and much to
lose.” For the enterprising investor this means that his operations for
profit should be based not on optimism but on arithmetic. For every
investor it means that when he limits his return to a small figure—as
formerly, at least, in a conventional bond or preferred stock—he must
demand convincing evidence that he is not risking a substantial part of
his principal.</p>
<p>A fourth business rule is more positive: “Have the courage of your
knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion from the facts
and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it—even though others may
hesitate or differ.” (You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd
disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are
right.) Similarly, in the world of securities, courage becomes the
supreme virtue after adequate knowledge and a tested judgment are at
hand.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the typical investor, it is by no means necessary for
his success that he bring these qualities to bear upon his
program—provided he limits his ambition to his capacity and confines his
activities within the safe and narrow path of standard, defensive
investment. To achieve satisfactory investment results is easier than
most people realize; to achieve superior results is harder than it
looks.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 20</p>
<p>If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a
universe of infinite possibilities, we may find ourselves at the mercy
of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized, or easily
referenced.</p>
<p>—Agent Fox Mulder, The X-Files</p>
<p>First, Don’t Lose</p>
<p>What is risk?</p>
<p>You’ll get different answers depending on whom, and when, you ask. In
1999, risk didn’t mean losing money; it meant making less money than
someone else. What many people feared was bumping into somebody at a
barbecue who was getting even richer even quicker by day trading dot-com
stocks than they were. Then, quite suddenly, by 2003 risk had come to
mean that the stock market might keep dropping until it wiped out
whatever traces of wealth you still had left.</p>
<p>While its meaning may seem nearly as fickle and fluctuating as the
financial markets themselves, risk has some profound and permanent
attributes. The people who take the biggest gambles and make the biggest
gains in a bull market are almost always the ones who get hurt the worst
in the bear market that inevitably follows. (Being “right” makes
speculators even more eager to take extra risk, as their confidence
catches fire.) And once you lose big money, you then have to gamble even
harder just to get back to where you were, like a racetrack or casino
gambler who desperately doubles up after every bad bet. Unless you are
phenomenally lucky, that’s a recipe for disaster. No wonder, when he was
asked to sum up everything he had learned in his long career about how
to get rich, the legendary financier J. K. Klingenstein of Wertheim
andandandand Co. answered simply: “Don’t lose.”1 This graph shows what
he meant:</p>
<p>FIGURE 20-1</p>
<p>The Cost of Loss</p>
<p>Imagine that you find a stock that you think can grow at 10% a year
even if the market only grows 5% annually. Unfortunately, you are so
enthusiastic that you pay too high a price, and the stock loses 50% of
its value the first year. Even if the stock then generates double the
market’s return, it will take you more than 16 years to overtake the
market—simply because you paid too much, and lost too much, at the
outset.</p>
<p>Losing some money is an inevitable part of investing, and there’s
nothing you can do to prevent it. But, to be an intelligent investor,
you must take responsibility for ensuring that you never lose most or
all of your money. The Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, is often
portrayed standing on tiptoe, ready to dart away in the blink of an eye.
To keep her symbolically in place, some of Lakshmi’s devotees will lash
her statue down with strips of fabric or nail its feet to the floor. For
the intelligent investor, Graham’s “margin of safety” performs the same
function: By refusing to pay too much for an investment, you minimize
the chances that your wealth will ever disappear or suddenly be
destroyed.</p>
<p>Consider this: Over the four quarters ending in December 1999, JDS
Uniphase Corp., the fiber-optics company, generated 73 million in net
sales, on which it lost 13 million. Its tangible assets totaled .5
billion. Yet, on March 7, 2000, JDS Uniphase’s stock hit 53 a share,
giving the company a total market value of roughly 43 billion.2 And
then, like most “New Era” stocks, it crashed. Anyone who bought it that
day and still clung to it at the end of 2002 faced these prospects:</p>
<p>FIGURE 20-2</p>
<p>Breaking Even Is Hard to Do</p>
<p>If you had bought JDS Uniphase at its peak price of 53.421 on March
7, 2000, and still held it at year-end 2002 (when it closed at .47), how
long would it take you to get back to your purchase price at various
annual average rates of return?</p>
<p>Even at a robust 10% annual rate of return, it will take more than 43
years to break even on this overpriced purchase!</p>
<p>The Risk is Not in Our Stocks, But in Ourselves</p>
<p>Risk exists in another dimension: inside you. If you overestimate how
well you really understand an investment, or overstate your ability to
ride out a temporary plunge in prices, it doesn’t matter what you own or
how the market does. Ultimately, financial risk resides not in what
kinds of investments you have, but in what kind of investor you are. If
you want to know what risk really is, go to the nearest bathroom and
step up to the mirror. That’s risk, gazing back at you from the
glass.</p>
<p>As you look at yourself in the mirror, what should you watch for? The
Nobel-prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains two factors
that characterize good decisions:</p>
<p>“well-calibrated confidence” (do I understand this investment as well
as I think I do?)</p>
<p>“correctly-anticipated regret” (how will I react if my analysis turns
out to be wrong?).</p>
<p>To find out whether your confidence is well-calibrated, look in the
mirror and ask yourself: “What is the likelihood that my analysis is
right?” Think carefully through these questions:</p>
<p>How much experience do I have? What is my track record with similar
decisions in the past?</p>
<p>What is the typical track record of other people who have tried this
in the past?3</p>
<p>If I am buying, someone else is selling. How likely is it that I know
something that this other person (or company) does not know?</p>
<p>If I am selling, someone else is buying. How likely is it that I know
something that this other person (or company) does not know?</p>
<p>Have I calculated how much this investment needs to go up for me to
break even after my taxes and costs of trading?</p>
<p>Next, look in the mirror to find out whether you are the kind of
person who correctly anticipates your regret. Start by asking: “Do I
fully understand the consequences if my analysis turns out to be wrong?”
Answer that question by considering these points:</p>
<p>If I’m right, I could make a lot of money. But what if I’m wrong?
Based on the historical performance of similar investments, how much
could I lose?</p>
<p>Do I have other investments that will tide me over if this decision
turns out to be wrong? Do I already hold stocks, bonds, or funds with a
proven record of going up when the kind of investment I’m considering
goes down? Am I putting too much of my capital at risk with this new
investment?</p>
<p>When I tell myself, “You have a high tolerance for risk,” how do I
know? Have I ever lost a lot of money on an investment? How did it feel?
Did I buy more, or did I bail out?</p>
<p>Am I relying on my willpower alone to prevent me from panicking at
the wrong time? Or have I controlled my own behavior in advance by
diversifying, signing an investment contract, and dollar-cost
averaging?</p>
<p>You should always remember, in the words of the psychologist Paul
Slovic, that “risk is brewed from an equal dose of two
ingredients—probabilities and consequences.”4 Before you invest, you
must ensure that you have realistically assessed your probability of
being right and how you will react to the consequences of being
wrong.</p>
<p>Pascal’s Wager</p>
<p>The investment philosopher Peter Bernstein has another way of summing
this up. He reaches back to Blaise Pascal, the great French
mathematician and theologian (1623–1662), who created a thought
experiment in which an agnostic must gamble on whether or not God
exists. The ante this person must put up for the wager is his conduct in
this life; the ultimate payoff in the gamble is the fate of his soul in
the afterlife. In this wager, Pascal asserts, “reason cannot decide” the
probability of God’s existence. Either God exists or He does not—and
only faith, not reason, can answer that question. But while the
probabilities in Pascal’s wager are a toss-up, the consequences are
perfectly clear and utterly certain. As Bernstein explains:</p>
<p>Suppose you act as though God is and 〔you〕 lead a life of virtue
and abstinence, when in fact there is no god. You will have passed up
some goodies in life, but there will be rewards as well. Now suppose you
act as though God is not and spend a life of sin, selfishness, and lust
when in fact God is. You may have had fun and thrills during the
relatively brief duration of your lifetime, but when the day of judgment
rolls around you are in big trouble.5</p>
<p>Concludes Bernstein: “In making decisions under conditions of
uncertainty, the consequences must dominate the probabilities. We never
know the future.” Thus, as Graham has reminded you in every chapter of
this book, the intelligent investor must focus not just on getting the
analysis right. You must also ensure against loss if your analysis turns
out to be wrong—as even the best analyses will be at least some of the
time. The probability of making at least one mistake at some point in
your investing lifetime is virtually 100%, and those odds are entirely
out of your control. However, you do have control over the consequences
of being wrong. Many “investors” put essentially all of their money into
dot-com stocks in 1999; an online survey of 1,338 Americans by Money
Magazine in 1999 found that nearly one-tenth of them had at least 85% of
their money in Internet stocks. By ignoring Graham’s call for a margin
of safety, these people took the wrong side of Pascal’s wager. Certain
that they knew the probabilities of being right, they did nothing to
protect themselves against the consequences of being wrong.</p>
<p>Simply by keeping your holdings permanently diversified, and refusing
to fling money at Mr. Market’s latest, craziest fashions, you can ensure
that the consequences of your mistakes will never be catastrophic. No
matter what Mr. Market throws at you, you will always be able to say,
with a quiet confidence, “This, too, shall pass away.”</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>We know very well two partners who spent a good part of their lives
handling their own and other people’s funds on Wall Street. Some hard
experience taught them it was better to be safe and careful rather than
to try to make all the money in the world. They established a rather
unique approach to security operations, which combined good profit
possibilities with sound values. They avoided anything that appeared
overpriced and were rather too quick to dispose of issues that had
advanced to levels they deemed no longer attractive. Their portfolio was
always well diversified, with more than a hundred different issues
represented. In this way they did quite well through many years of ups
and downs in the general market; they averaged about 20% per annum on
the several millions of capital they had accepted for management, and
their clients were well pleased with the results.*</p>
<p>In the year in which the first edition of this book appeared an
opportunity was offered to the partners’ fund to purchase a
half-interest in a growing enterprise. For some reason the industry did
not have Wall Street appeal at the time and the deal had been turned
down by quite a few important houses. But the pair was impressed by the
company’s possibilities; what was decisive for them was that the price
was moderate in relation to current earnings and asset value. The
partners went ahead with the acquisition, amounting in dollars to about
one-fifth of their fund. They became closely identified with the new
business interest, which prospered.†</p>
<p>In fact it did so well that the price of its shares advanced to two
hundred times or more the price paid for the half-interest. The advance
far outstripped the actual growth in profits, and almost from the start
the quotation appeared much too high in terms of the partners’ own
investment standards. But since they regarded the company as a sort of
“family business,” they continued to maintain a substantial ownership of
the shares despite the spectacular price rise. A large number of
participants in their funds did the same, and they became millionaires
through their holding in this one enterprise, plus later-organized
affiliates.*</p>
<p>Ironically enough, the aggregate of profits accruing from this single
investment decision far exceeded the sum of all the others realized
through 20 years of wide-ranging operations in the partners’ specialized
fields, involving much investigation, endless pondering, and countless
individual decisions.</p>
<p>Are there morals to this story of value to the intelligent investor?
An obvious one is that there are several different ways to make and keep
money in Wall Street. Another, not so obvious, is that one lucky break,
or one supremely shrewd decision—can we tell them apart?—may count for
more than a lifetime of journeyman efforts.1 But behind the luck, or the
crucial decision, there must usually exist a background of preparation
and disciplined capacity. One needs to be sufficiently established and
recognized so that these opportunities will knock at his particular
door. One must have the means, the judgment, and the courage to take
advantage of them.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot promise a like spectacular experience to all
intelligent investors who remain both prudent and alert through the
years. We are not going to end with J. J. Raskob’s slogan that we made
fun of at the beginning: “Everybody can be rich.” But interesting
possibilities abound on the financial scene, and the intelligent and
enterprising investor should be able to find both enjoyment and profit
in this three-ring circus. Excitement is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Commentary on Postscript</p>
<p>Successful investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it. At
first glance, when you realize that Graham put 25% of his fund into a
single stock, you might think he was gambling rashly with his investors’
money. But then, when you discover that Graham had painstakingly
established that he could liquidate GEICO for at least what he paid for
it, it becomes clear that Graham was taking very little financial risk.
But he needed enormous courage to take the psychological risk of such a
big bet on so unknown a stock.1</p>
<p>And today’s headlines are full of fearful facts and unresolved risks:
the death of the 1990s bull market, sluggish economic growth, corporate
fraud, the specters of terrorism and war. “Investors don’t like
uncertainty,” a market strategist is intoning right now on financial TV
or in today’s newspaper. But investors have never liked uncertainty—and
yet it is the most fundamental and enduring condition of the investing
world. It always has been, and it always will be. At heart,
“uncertainty” and “investing” are synonyms. In the real world, no one
has ever been given the ability to see that any particular time is the
best time to buy stocks. Without a saving faith in the future, no one
would ever invest at all. To be an investor, you must be a believer in a
better tomorrow.</p>
<p>The most literate of investors, Graham loved the story of Ulysses,
told through the poetry of Homer, Alfred Tennyson, and Dante. Late in
his life, Graham relished the scene in Dante’s Inferno when Ulysses
describes inspiring his crew to sail westward into the unknown waters
beyond the gates of Hercules:</p>
<p>“O brothers,” I said, “who after a hundred thousand</p>
<p>perils have reached the west,</p>
<p>in this little waking vigil</p>
<p>that still remains to our senses,</p>
<p>let us not choose to avoid the experience</p>
<p>of the unpeopled world that lies behind the sun.</p>
<p>Consider the seeds from which you sprang:</p>
<p>You were made not to live like beasts,</p>
<p>but to seek virtue and understanding.”</p>
<p>With this little oration I made my shipmates</p>
<p>so eager for the voyage</p>
<p>that it would have hurt to hold them back.</p>
<p>And we swung our stern toward the morning</p>
<p>and turned our oars into wings for the wild flight.2</p>
<p>Investing, too, is an adventure; the financial future is always an
uncharted world. With Graham as your guide, your lifelong investing
voyage should be as safe and confident as it is adventurous.</p>
