<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>
<p>The Investor and Inflation</p>
<p>Inflation, and the fight against it, has been very much in the
public’s mind in recent years. The shrinkage in the purchasing power of
the dollar in the past, and particularly the fear (or hope by
speculators) of a serious further decline in the future, has greatly
influenced the thinking of Wall Street. It is clear that those with a
fixed dollar income will suffer when the cost of living advances, and
the same applies to a fixed amount of dollar principal. Holders of
stocks, on the other hand, have the possibility that a loss of the
dollar’s purchasing power may be offset by advances in their dividends
and the prices of their shares.</p>
<p>On the basis of these undeniable facts many financial authorities
have concluded that (1) bonds are an inherently undesirable form of
investment, and (2) consequently, common stocks are by their very nature
more desirable investments than bonds. We have heard of charitable
institutions being advised that their portfolios should consist 100% of
stocks and zero percent of bonds.* This is quite a reversal from the
earlier days when trust investments were restricted by law to high-grade
bonds (and a few choice preferred stocks).</p>
<p>Our readers must have enough intelligence to recognize that even
high-quality stocks cannot be a better purchase than bonds under all
conditions—i.e., regardless of how high the stock market may be and how
low the current dividend return compared with the rates available on
bonds. A statement of this kind would be as absurd as was the contrary
one—too often heard years ago—that any bond is safer than any stock. In
this chapter we shall try to apply various measurements to the inflation
factor, in order to reach some conclusions as to the extent to which the
investor may wisely be influenced by expectations regarding future rises
in the price level.</p>
<p>In this matter, as in so many others in finance, we must base our
views of future policy on a knowledge of past experience. Is inflation
something new for this country, at least in the serious form it has
taken since 1965? If we have seen comparable (or worse) inflations in
living experience, what lessons can be learned from them in confronting
the inflation of today? Let us start with Table 2-1, a condensed
historical tabulation that contains much information about changes in
the general price level and concomitant changes in the earnings and
market value of common stocks. Our figures will begin with 1915, and
thus cover 55 years, presented at five-year intervals. (We use 1946
instead of 1945 to avoid the last year of wartime price controls.)</p>
<p>The first thing we notice is that we have had inflation in the
past—lots of it. The largest five-year dose was between 1915 and 1920,
when the cost of living nearly doubled. This compares with the advance
of 15% between 1965 and 1970. In between, we have had three periods of
declining prices and then six of advances at varying rates, some rather
small. On this showing, the investor should clearly allow for the
probability of continuing or recurrent inflation to come.</p>
<p>Can we tell what the rate of inflation is likely to be? No clear
answer is suggested by our table; it shows variations of all sorts. It
would seem sensible, however, to take our cue from the rather consistent
record of the past 20 years. The average annual rise in the consumer
price level for this period has been 2.5%; that for 1965–1970 was 4.5%;
that for 1970 alone was 5.4%. Official government policy has been
strongly against large-scale inflation, and there are some reasons to
believe that Federal policies will be more effective in the future than
in recent years.* We think it would be reasonable for an investor at
this point to base his thinking and decisions on a probable (far from
certain) rate of future inflation of, say, 3% per annum. (This would
compare with an annual rate of about 2½% for the entire period
1915–1970.)1</p>
<p>What would be the implications of such an advance? It would eat up,
in higher living costs, about one-half the income now obtainable on good
medium-term tax-free bonds (or our assumed after-tax equivalent from
high-grade corporate bonds). This would be a serious shrinkage, but it
should not be exaggerated. It would not mean that the true value, or the
purchasing power, of the investor’s fortune need be reduced over the
years. If he spent half his interest income after taxes he would
maintain this buying power intact, even against a 3% annual
inflation.</p>
<p>But the next question, naturally, is, “Can the investor be reasonably
sure of doing better by buying and holding other things than high-grade
bonds, even at the unprecedented rate of return offered in 1970–1971?”
Would not, for example, an all-stock program be preferable to a
part-bond, part-stock program? Do not common stocks have a built-in
protection against inflation, and are they not almost certain to give a
better return over the years than will bonds? Have not in fact stocks
treated the investor far better than have bonds over the 55-year period
of our study?</p>
<p>The answer to these questions is somewhat complicated. Common stocks
have indeed done better than bonds over a long period of time in the
past. The rise of the DJIA from an average of 77 in 1915 to an average
of 753 in 1970 works out at an annual compounded rate of just about 4%,
to which we may add another 4% for average dividend return. (The
corresponding figures for the S andandandand P composite are about the
same.) These combined figures of 8% per year are of course much better
than the return enjoyed from bonds over the same 55-year period. But
they do not exceed that now offered by high-grade bonds. This brings us
to the next logical question: Is there a persuasive reason to believe
that common stocks are likely to do much better in future years than
they have in the last five and one-half decades?</p>
<p>Our answer to this crucial question must be a flat no. Common stocks
may do better in the future than in the past, but they are far from
certain to do so. We must deal here with two different time elements in
investment results. The first covers what is likely to occur over the
long-term future—say, the next 25 years. The second applies to what is
likely to happen to the investor—both financially and
psychologically—over short or intermediate periods, say five years or
less. His frame of mind, his hopes and apprehensions, his satisfaction
or discontent with what he has done, above all his decisions what to do
next, are all determined not in the retrospect of a lifetime of
investment but rather by his experience from year to year.</p>
<p>On this point we can be categorical. There is no close time
connection between inflationary (or deflationary) conditions and the
movement of common-stock earnings and prices. The obvious example is the
recent period, 1966–1970. The rise in the cost of living was 22%, the
largest in a five-year period since 1946–1950. But both stock earnings
and stock prices as a whole have declined since 1965. There are similar
contradictions in both directions in the record of previous five-year
periods.</p>
<p>Inflation and Corporate Earnings</p>
<p>Another and highly important approach to the subject is by a study of
the earnings rate on capital shown by American business. This has
fluctuated, of course, with the general rate of economic activity, but
it has shown no general tendency to advance with wholesale prices or the
cost of living. Actually this rate has fallen rather markedly in the
past twenty years in spite of the inflation of the period. (To some
degree the decline was due to the charging of more liberal depreciation
rates. See Table 2-2.) Our extended studies have led to the conclusion
that the investor cannot count on much above the recent five-year rate
earned on the DJIA group—about 10% on net tangible assets (book value)
behind the shares.2Since the market value of these issues is well above
their book value—say, 900 market vs. 560 book in mid-1971—the earnings
on current market price work out only at some 6¼%. (This relationship is
generally expressed in the reverse, or “times earnings,” manner—e.g.,
that the DJIA price of 900 equals 18 times the actual earnings for the
12 months ended June 1971.)</p>
<p>Our figures gear in directly with the suggestion in the previous
chapter* that the investor may assume an average dividend return of
about 3.5% on the market value of his stocks, plus an appreciation of,
say, 4% annually resulting from reinvested profits. (Note that each
dollar added to book value is here assumed to increase the market price
by about .60.)</p>
<p>The reader will object that in the end our calculations make no
allowance for an increase in common-stock earnings and values to result
from our projected 3% annual inflation. Our justification is the absence
of any sign that the inflation of a comparable amount in the past has
had any direct effect on reported per-share earnings. The cold figures
demonstrate that all the large gain in the earnings of the DJIA unit in
the past 20 years was due to a proportionately large growth of invested
capital coming from reinvested profits. If inflation had operated as a
separate favorable factor, its effect would have been to increase the
“value” of previously existing capital; this in turn should increase the
rate of earnings on such old capital and therefore on the old and new
capital combined. But nothing of the kind actually happened in the past
20 years, during which the wholesale price level has advanced nearly
40%. (Business earnings should be influenced more by wholesale prices
than by “consumer prices.”) The only way that inflation can add to
common stock values is by raising the rate of earnings on capital
investment. On the basis of the past record this has not been the
case.</p>
<p>In the economic cycles of the past, good business was accompanied by
a rising price level and poor business by falling prices. It was
generally felt that “a little inflation” was helpful to business
profits. This view is not contradicted by the history of 1950–1970,
which reveals a combination of generally continued prosperity and
generally rising prices. But the figures indicate that the effect of all
this on the earning power of common-stock capital (“equity capital”) has
been quite limited; in fact it has not even served to maintain the rate
of earnings on the investment. Clearly there have been important
offsetting influences which have prevented any increase in the real
profitability of American corporations as a whole. Perhaps the most
important of these have been (1) a rise in wage rates exceeding the
gains in productivity, and (2) the need for huge amounts of new capital,
thus holding down the ratio of sales to capital employed.</p>
<p>Our figures in Table 2-2 indicate that so far from inflation having
benefited our corporations and their shareholders, its effect has been
quite the opposite. The most striking figures in our table are those for
the growth of corporate debt between 1950 and 1969. It is surprising how
little attention has been paid by economists and by Wall Street to this
development. The debt of corporations has expanded nearly fivefold while
their profits before taxes a little more than doubled. With the great
rise in interest rates during this period, it is evident that the
aggregate corporate debt is now an adverse economic factor of some
magnitude and a real problem for many individual enterprises. (Note that
in 1950 net earnings after interest but before income tax were about 30%
of corporate debt, while in 1969 they were only 13.2% of debt. The 1970
ratio must have been even less satisfactory.) In sum it appears that a
significant part of the 11% being earned on corporate equities as a
whole is accomplished by the use of a large amount of new debt costing
4% or less after tax credit. If our corporations had maintained the debt
ratio of 1950, their earnings rate on stock capital would have fallen
still lower, in spite of the inflation.</p>
<p>TABLE 2-2 Corporate Debt, Profits, and Earnings on Capital,
1950–1969</p>
<p>The stock market has considered that the public-utility enterprises
have been a chief victim of inflation, being caught between a great
advance in the cost of borrowed money and the difficulty of raising the
rates charged under the regulatory process. But this may be the place to
remark that the very fact that the unit costs of electricity, gas, and
telephone services have advanced so much less than the general price
index puts these companies in a strong strategic position for the
future.3 They are entitled by law to charge rates sufficient for an
adequate return on their invested capital, and this will probably
protect their shareholders in the future as it has in the inflations of
the past.</p>
<p>All of the above brings us back to our conclusion that the investor
has no sound basis for expecting more than an average overall return of,
say, 8% on a portfolio of DJIA-type common stocks purchased at the late
1971 price level. But even if these expectations should prove to be
understated by a substantial amount, the case would not be made for an
all-stock investment program. If there is one thing guaranteed for the
future, it is that the earnings and average annual market value of a
stock portfolio will not grow at the uniform rate of 4%, or any other
figure. In the memorable words of the elder J. P. Morgan, “They will
fluctuate.”* This means, first, that the common-stock buyer at today’s
prices—or tomorrow’s—will be running a real risk of having
unsatisfactory results therefrom over a period of years. It took 25
years for General Electric (and the DJIA itself) to recover the ground
lost in the 1929–1932 debacle. Besides that, if the investor
concentrates his portfolio on common stocks he is very likely to be led
astray either by exhilarating advances or by distressing declines. This
is particularly true if his reasoning is geared closely to expectations
of further inflation. For then, if another bull market comes along, he
will take the big rise not as a danger signal of an inevitable fall, not
as a chance to cash in on his handsome profits, but rather as a
vindication of the inflation hypothesis and as a reason to keep on
buying common stocks no matter how high the market level nor how low the
dividend return. That way lies sorrow.</p>
<p>Alternatives to Common Stocks as Inflation Hedges</p>
<p>The standard policy of people all over the world who mistrust their
currency has been to buy and hold gold. This has been against the law
for American citizens since 1935—luckily for them. In the past 35 years
the price of gold in the open market has advanced from 5 per ounce to 8
in early 1972—a rise of only 35%. But during all this time the holder of
gold has received no income return on his capital, and instead has
incurred some annual expense for storage. Obviously, he would have done
much better with his money at interest in a savings bank, in spite of
the rise in the general price level.</p>
<p>The near-complete failure of gold to protect against a loss in the
purchasing power of the dollar must cast grave doubt on the ability of
the ordinary investor to protect himself against inflation by putting
his money in “things.”* Quite a few categories of valuable objects have
had striking advances in market value over the years—such as diamonds,
paintings by masters, first editions of books, rare stamps and coins,
etc. But in many, perhaps most, of these cases there seems to be an
element of the artificial or the precarious or even the unreal about the
quoted prices. Somehow it is hard to think of paying 7,500 for a U.S.
silver dollar dated 1804 (but not even minted that year) as an
“investment operation.”4 We acknowledge we are out of our depth in this
area. Very few of our readers will find the swimming safe and easy
there.</p>
<p>The outright ownership of real estate has long been considered as a
sound long-term investment, carrying with it a goodly amount of
protection against inflation. Unfortunately, real-estate values are also
subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in location,
price paid, etc.; there are pitfalls in salesmen’s wiles. Finally,
diversification is not practical for the investor of moderate means,
except by various types of participations with others and with the
special hazards that attach to new flotations—not too different from
common-stock ownership. This too is not our field. All we should say to
the investor is, “Be sure it’s yours before you go into it.”</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Naturally, we return to the policy recommended in our previous
chapter. Just because of the uncertainties of the future the investor
cannot afford to put all his funds into one basket—neither in the bond
basket, despite the unprecedentedly high returns that bonds have
recently offered; nor in the stock basket, despite the prospect of
continuing inflation.</p>
<p>The more the investor depends on his portfolio and the income
therefrom, the more necessary it is for him to guard against the
unexpected and the disconcerting in this part of his life. It is
axiomatic that the conservative investor should seek to minimize his
risks. We think strongly that the risks involved in buying, say, a
telephone-company bond at yields of nearly 7½% are much less than those
involved in buying the DJIA at 900 (or any stock list equivalent
thereto). But the possibility of large-scale inflation remains, and the
investor must carry some insurance against it. There is no certainty
that a stock component will insure adequately against such inflation,
but it should carry more protection than the bond component.</p>
<p>This is what we said on the subject in our 1965 edition (p. 97), and
we would write the same today:</p>
<p>It must be evident to the reader that we have no enthusiasm for
common stocks at these levels (892 for the DJIA). For reasons already
given we feel that the defensive investor cannot afford to be without an
appreciable proportion of common stocks in his portfolio, even if we
regard them as the lesser of two evils—the greater being the risks in an
all-bond holding.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 2</p>
<p>Americans are getting stronger. Twenty years ago, it took two people
to carry ten dollars’ worth of groceries. Today, a five-year-old can do
it.</p>
<p>—Henny Youngman</p>
<p>Inflation? Who cares about that?</p>
<p>After all, the annual rise in the cost of goods and services averaged
less than 2.2% between 1997 and 2002—and economists believe that even
that rock-bottom rate may be overstated.1 (Think, for instance, of how
the prices of computers and home electronics have plummeted—and how the
quality of many goods has risen, meaning that consumers are getting
better value for their money.) In recent years, the true rate of
inflation in the United States has probably run around 1% annually—an
increase so infinitesimal that many pundits have proclaimed that
“inflation is dead.”2</p>
<p>The Money Illusion</p>
<p>There’s another reason investors overlook the importance of
inflation: what psychologists call the “money illusion.” If you receive
a 2% raise in a year when inflation runs at 4%, you will almost
certainly feel better than you will if you take a 2% pay cut during a
year when inflation is zero. Yet both changes in your salary leave you
in a virtually identical position—2% worse off after inflation. So long
as the nominal (or absolute) change is positive, we view it as a good
thing—even if the real (or after-inflation) result is negative. And any
change in your own salary is more vivid and specific than the
generalized change of prices in the economy as a whole.3 Likewise,
investors were delighted to earn 11% on bank certificates of deposit
(CDs) in 1980 and are bitterly disappointed to be earning only around 2%
in 2003—even though they were losing money after inflation back then but
are keeping up with inflation now. The nominal rate we earn is printed
in the bank’s ads and posted in its window, where a high number makes us
feel good. But inflation eats away at that high number in secret.
Instead of taking out ads, inflation just takes away our wealth. That’s
why inflation is so easy to overlook—and why it’s so important to
measure your investing success not just by what you make, but by how
much you keep after inflation.</p>
<p>More basically still, the intelligent investor must always be on
guard against whatever is unexpected and underestimated. There are three
good reasons to believe that inflation is not dead:</p>
<p>As recently as 1973–1982, the United States went through one of the
most painful bursts of inflation in our history. As measured by the
Consumer Price Index, prices more than doubled over that period, rising
at an annualized rate of nearly 9%. In 1979 alone, inflation raged at
13.3%, paralyzing the economy in what became known as “stagflation”—and
leading many commentators to question whether America could compete in
the global market place.4 Goods and services priced at 00 in the
beginning of 1973 cost 30 by the end of 1982, shriveling the value of a
dollar to less than 45 cents. No one who lived through it would scoff at
such destruction of wealth; no one who is prudent can fail to protect
against the risk that it might recur.</p>
<p>Since 1960, 69% of the world’s market-oriented countries have
suffered at least one year in which inflation ran at an annualized rate
of 25% or more. On average, those inflationary periods destroyed 53% of
an investor’s purchasing power.5 We would be crazy not to hope that
America is somehow exempt from such a disaster. But we would be even
crazier to conclude that it can never happen here.6</p>
<p>Rising prices allow Uncle Sam to pay off his debts with dollars that
have been cheapened by inflation. Completely eradicating inflation runs
against the economic self-interest of any government that regularly
borrows money.7</p>
<p>Half a Hedge</p>
<p>What, then, can the intelligent investor do to guard against
inflation? The standard answer is “buy stocks”—but, as common answers so
often are, it is not entirely true.</p>
<p>Figure 2-1 shows, for each year from 1926 through 2002, the
relationship between inflation and stock prices.</p>
<p>As you can see, in years when the prices of consumer goods and
services fell, as on the left side of the graph, stock returns were
terrible—with the market losing up to 43% of its value.8 When inflation
shot above 6%, as in the years on the right end of the graph, stocks
also stank. The stock market lost money in eight of the 14 years in
which inflation exceeded 6%; the average return for those 14 years was a
measly 2.6%.</p>
<p>While mild inflation allows companies to pass the increased costs of
their own raw materials on to customers, high inflation wreaks
havoc—forcing customers to slash their purchases and depressing activity
throughout the economy.</p>
<p>The historical evidence is clear: Since the advent of accurate
stock-market data in 1926, there have been 64 five-year periods (i.e.,
1926–1930, 1927–1931, 1928–1932, and so on through 1998–2002). In 50 of
those 64 five-year periods (or 78% of the time), stocks outpaced
inflation.9 That’s impressive, but imperfect; it means that stocks
failed to keep up with inflation about one-fifth of the time.</p>
<p>Two Acronyms to the Rescue</p>
<p>Fortunately, you can bolster your defenses against inflation by
branching out beyond stocks. Since Graham last wrote, two
inflation-fighters have become widely available to investors:</p>
<p>REITs. Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs (pronounced “reets”),
are companies that own and collect rent from commercial and residential
properties.10 Bundled into real-estate mutual funds, REITs do a decent
job of combating inflation. The best choice is Vanguard REIT Index Fund;
other relatively low-cost choices include Cohen andandandand Steers
Realty Shares, Columbia Real Estate Equity Fund, and Fidelity Real
Estate Investment Fund.11 While a REIT fund is unlikely to be a
foolproof inflation-fighter, in the long run it should give you some
defense against the erosion of purchasing power without hampering your
overall returns.</p>
<p>TIPS. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are U.S.
government bonds, first issued in 1997, that automatically go up in
value when inflation rises. Because the full faith and credit of the
United States stands behind them, all Treasury bonds are safe from the
risk of default (or nonpayment of interest). But TIPS also guarantee
that the value of your investment won’t be eroded by inflation. In one
easy package, you insure yourself against financial loss and the loss of
purchasing power.12</p>
<p>There is one catch, however. When the value of your TIPS bond rises
as inflation heats up, the Internal Revenue Service regards that
increase in value as taxable income—even though it is purely a paper
gain (unless you sold the bond at its newly higher price). Why does this
make sense to the IRS? The intelligent investor will remember the wise
words of financial analyst Mark Schweber: “The one question never to ask
a bureaucrat is ‘Why?’” Because of this exasperating tax complication,
TIPS are best suited for a tax-deferred retirement account like an IRA,
Keogh, or 401(k), where they will not jack up your taxable income.</p>
<p>You can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. government at www.
publicdebt.treas.gov/of/ofinflin.htm, or in a low-cost mutual fund like
Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities or Fidelity Inflation-Protected
Bond Fund.13 Either directly or through a fund, TIPS are the ideal
substitute for the proportion of your retirement funds you would
otherwise keep in cash. Do not trade them: TIPS can be volatile in the
short run, so they work best as a permanent, lifelong holding. For most
investors, allocating at least 10% of your retirement assets to TIPS is
an intelligent way to keep a portion of your money absolutely safe—and
entirely beyond the reach of the long, invisible claws of inflation.</p>
