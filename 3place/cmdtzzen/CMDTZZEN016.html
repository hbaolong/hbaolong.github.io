<h4 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h4>
<p>Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor</p>
<p>In the previous chapter we have dealt with common-stock selection in
terms of broad groups of eligible securities, from which the defensive
investor is free to make up any list that he or his adviser prefers,
provided adequate diversification is achieved. Our emphasis in selection
has been chiefly on exclusions—advising on the one hand against all
issues of recognizably poor quality, and on the other against the
highest-quality issues if their price is so high as to involve a
considerable speculative risk. In this chapter, addressed to the
enterprising investor, we must consider the possibilities and the means
of making individual selections which are likely to prove more
profitable than an across-the-board average.</p>
<p>What are the prospects of doing this successfully? We would be less
than frank, as the euphemism goes, if we did not at the outset express
some grave reservations on this score. At first blush the case for
successful selection appears self-evident. To get average results—e.g.,
equivalent to the performance of the DJIA—should require no special
ability of any kind. All that is needed is a portfolio identical with,
or similar to, those thirty prominent issues. Surely, then, by the
exercise of even a moderate degree of skill—derived from study,
experience, and native ability—it should be possible to obtain
substantially better results than the DJIA.</p>
<p>Yet there is considerable and impressive evidence to the effect that
this is very hard to do, even though the qualifications of those trying
it are of the highest. The evidence lies in the record of the numerous
investment companies, or “funds,” which have been in operation for many
years. Most of these funds are large enough to command the services of
the best financial or security analysts in the field, together with all
the other constituents of an adequate research department. Their
expenses of operation, when spread over their ample capital, average
about one-half of 1% a year thereon, or less. These costs are not
negligible in themselves; but when they are compared with the
approximately 15% annual overall return on common stocks generally in
the decade 1951–1960, and even the 6% return in 1961–1970, they do not
bulk large. A small amount of superior selective ability should easily
have overcome that expense handicap and brought in a superior net result
for the fund shareholders.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, however, the all-common-stock funds failed over a
long span of years to earn quite as good a return as was shown on
Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock averages or the market as a
whole. This conclusion has been substantiated by several comprehensive
studies. To quote the latest one before us, covering the period
1960–1968:*</p>
<p>It appears from these results that random portfolios of New York
Stock Exchange stocks with equal investment in each stock performed on
the average better over the period than did mutual funds in the same
risk class. The differences were fairly substantial for the low-and
medium-risk portfolios (3.7% and 2.5% respectively per annum), but quite
small for the high-risk portfolios(0.2% per annum).1</p>
<p>As we pointed out in Chapter 9, these comparative figures in no way
invalidate the usefulness of the investment funds as a financial
institution. For they do make available to all members of the investing
public the possibility of obtaining approximately average results on
their common-stock commitments. For a variety of reasons, most members
of the public who put their money in common stocks of their own choice
fail to do nearly as well. But to the objective observer the failure of
the funds to better the performance of a broad average is a pretty
conclusive indication that such an achievement, instead of being easy,
is in fact extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Why should this be so? We can think of two different explanations,
each of which may be partially applicable. The first is the possibility
that the stock market does in fact reflect in the current prices not
only all the important facts about the companies’ past and current
performance, but also whatever expectations can be reasonably formed as
to their future. If this is so, then the diverse market movements which
subsequently take place—and these are often extreme—must be the result
of new developments and probabilities that could not be reliably
foreseen. This would make the price movements essentially fortuitous and
random. To the extent that the foregoing is true, the work of the
security analyst—however intelligent and thorough—must be largely
ineffective, because in essence he is trying to predict the
unpredictable.</p>
<p>The very multiplication of the number of security analysts may have
played an important part in bringing about this result. With hundreds,
even thousands, of experts studying the value factors behind an
important common stock, it would be natural to expect that its current
price would reflect pretty well the consensus of informed opinion on its
value. Those who would prefer it to other issues would do so for reasons
of personal partiality or optimism that could just as well be wrong as
right.</p>
<p>We have often thought of the analogy between the work of the host of
security analysts on Wall Street and the performance of master bridge
players at a duplicate-bridge tournament. The former try to pick the
stocks “most likely to succeed”; the latter to get top score for each
hand played. Only a limited few can accomplish either aim. To the extent
that all the bridge players have about the same level of expertness, the
winners are likely to be determined by “breaks” of various sorts rather
than superior skill. On Wall Street the leveling process is helped along
by the freemasonry that exists in the profession, under which ideas and
discoveries are quite freely shared at the numerous get-togethers of
various sorts. It is almost as if, at the analogous bridge tournament,
the various experts were looking over each other’s shoulders and arguing
out each hand as it was played.</p>
<p>The second possibility is of a quite different sort. Perhaps many of
the security analysts are handicapped by a flaw in their basic approach
to the problem of stock selection. They seek the industries with the
best prospects of growth, and the companies in these industries with the
best management and other advantages. The implication is that they will
buy into such industries and such companies at any price, however high,
and they will avoid less promising industries and companies no matter
how low the price of their shares. This would be the only correct
procedure if the earnings of the good companies were sure to grow at a
rapid rate indefinitely in the future, for then in theory their value
would be infinite. And if the less promising companies were headed for
extinction, with no salvage, the analysts would be right to consider
them unattractive at any price.</p>
<p>The truth about our corporate ventures is quite otherwise. Extremely
few companies have been able to show a high rate of uninterrupted growth
for long periods of time. Remarkably few, also, of the larger companies
suffer ultimate extinction. For most, their history is one of
vicissitudes, of ups and downs, of change in their relative standing. In
some the variations “from rags to riches and back” have been repeated on
almost a cyclical basis—the phrase used to be a standard one applied to
the steel industry—for others spectacular changes have been identified
with deterioration or improvement of management.*</p>
<p>How does the foregoing inquiry apply to the enterprising investor who
would like to make individual selections that will yield superior
results? It suggests first of all that he is taking on a difficult and
perhaps impracticable assignment. Readers of this book, however
intelligent and knowing, could scarcely expect to do a better job of
portfolio selection than the top analysts of the country. But if it is
true that a fairly large segment of the stock market is often
discriminated against or entirely neglected in the standard analytical
selections, then the intelligent investor may be in a position to profit
from the resultant undervaluations.</p>
<p>But to do so he must follow specific methods that are not generally
accepted on Wall Street, since those that are so accepted do not seem to
produce the results everyone would like to achieve. It would be rather
strange if—with all the brains at work professionally in the stock
market—there could be approaches which are both sound and relatively
unpopular. Yet our own career and reputation have been based on this
unlikely fact.*</p>
<p>A Summary of the Graham-Newman Methods</p>
<p>To give concreteness to the last statement, it should be worthwhile
to give a brief account of the types of operations we engaged in during
the thirty-year life of Graham-Newman Corporation, between 1926 and
1956.† These were classified in our records as follows:</p>
<p>Arbitrages: The purchase of a security and the simultaneous sale of
one or more other securities into which it was to be exchanged under a
plan of reorganization, merger, or the like.</p>
<p>Liquidations: Purchase of shares which were to receive one or more
cash payments in liquidation of the company’s assets.</p>
<p>Operations of these two classes were selected on the twin basis of
(a) a calculated annual return of 20% or more, and (b) our judgment that
the chance of a successful outcome was at least four out of five.</p>
<p>Related Hedges: The purchase of convertible bonds or convertible
preferred shares, and the simultaneous sale of the common stock into
which they were exchangeable. The position was established at close to a
parity basis—i.e., at a small maximum loss if the senior issue had
actually to be converted and the operation closed out in that way. But a
profit would be made if the common stock fell considerably more than the
senior issue, and the position closed out in the market.</p>
<p>Net-Current-Asset (or “Bargain”) Issues: The idea here was to acquire
as many issues as possible at a cost for each of less than their book
value in terms of net-current-assets alone—i.e., giving no value to the
plant account and other assets. Our purchases were made typically at
two-thirds or less of such stripped-down asset value. In most years we
carried a wide diversification here—at least 100 different issues.</p>
<p>We should add that from time to time we had some large-scale
acquisitions of the control type, but these are not relevant to the
present discussion.</p>
<p>We kept close track of the results shown by each class of operation.
In consequence of these follow-ups we discontinued two broader fields,
which were found not to have shown satisfactory overall results. The
first was the purchase of apparently attractive issues—based on our
general analysis—which were not obtainable at less than their
working-capital value alone. The second were “unrelated” hedging
operations, in which the purchased security was not exchangeable for the
common shares sold. (Such operations correspond roughly to those
recently embarked on by the new group of “hedge funds” in the
investment-company field.* In both cases a study of the results realized
by us over a period of ten years or more led us to conclude that the
profits were not sufficiently dependable—and the operations not
sufficiently “headache proof”—to justify our continuing them.</p>
<p>Hence from 1939 on our operations were limited to “selfliquidating”
situations, related hedges, working-capital bargains, and a few control
operations. Each of these classes gave us quite consistently
satisfactory results from then on, with the special feature that the
related hedges turned in good profits in the bear markets when our
“undervalued issues” were not doing so well.</p>
<p>We hesitate to prescribe our own diet for any large number of
intelligent investors. Obviously, the professional techniques we have
followed are not suitable for the defensive investor, who by definition
is an amateur. As for the aggressive investor, perhaps only a small
minority of them would have the type of temperament needed to limit
themselves so severely to only a relatively small part of the world of
securities. Most active-minded practitioners would prefer to venture
into wider channels. Their natural hunting grounds would be the entire
field of securities that they felt (a) were certainly not overvalued by
conservative measures, and (b) appeared decidedly more
attractive—because of their prospects or past record, or both—than the
average common stock. In such choices they would do well to apply
various tests of quality and price-reasonableness along the lines we
have proposed for the defensive investor. But they should be less
inflexible, permitting a considerable plus in one factor to offset a
small black mark in another. For example, he might not rule out a
company which had shown a deficit in a year such as 1970, if large
average earnings and other important attributes made the stock look
cheap. The enterprising investor may confine his choice to industries
and companies about which he holds an optimistic view, but we counsel
strongly against paying a high price for a stock (in relation to
earnings and assets) because of such enthusiasm. If he followed our
philosophy in this field he would more likely be the buyer of important
cyclical enterprises—such as steel shares perhaps—when the current
situation is unfavorable, the near-term prospects are poor, and the low
price fully reflects the current pessimism.*</p>
<p>Secondary Companies</p>
<p>Next in order for examination and possible selection would come
secondary companies that are making a good showing, have a satisfactory
past record, but appear to hold no charm for the public. These would be
enterprises on the order of ELTRA and Emhart at their 1970 closing
prices. (See Chapter 13 above.) There are various ways of going about
locating such companies. We should like to try a novel approach here and
give a reasonably detailed exposition of one such exercise in stock
selection. Ours is a double purpose. Many of our readers may find a
substantial practical value in the method we shall follow, or it may
suggest comparable methods to try out. Beyond that what we shall do may
help them to come to grips with the real world of common stocks, and
introduce them to one of the most fascinating and valuable little
volumes in existence. It is Standard andandandand Poor’s Stock Guide,
published monthly, and made available to the general public under annual
subscription. In addition many brokerage firms distribute the Guide to
their clients (on request.)</p>
<p>The great bulk of the Guide is given over to about 230 pages of
condensed statistical information on the stocks of more than 4,500
companies. These include all the issues listed on the various exchanges,
say 3,000, plus some 1,500 unlisted issues. Most of the items needed for
a first and even a second look at a given company appear in this
compendium. (From our viewpoint the important missing datum is the
net-asset-value, or book value, per share, which can be found in the
larger Standard andandandand Poor’s volumes and elsewhere.)</p>
<p>The investor who likes to play around with corporate figures will
find himself in clover with the Stock Guide. He can open to any page and
see before his eyes a condensed panorama of the splendors and miseries
of the stock market, with all-time high and low prices going as far back
as 1936, when available. He will find companies that have multiplied
their price 2,000 times from the minuscule low to the majestic high.
(For prestigious IBM the growth was “only” 333 times in that period.) He
will find (not so exceptionally) a company whose shares advanced from
3/8 to 68, and then fell back to 3.2 In the dividend record column he
will find one that goes back to 1791—paid by Industrial National Bank of
Rhode Island (which recently saw fit to change its ancient corporate
name).* If he looks at the Guide for the year-end 1969 he will read that
Penn Central Co. (as successor to Pennsylvania Railroad) has been paying
dividends steadily since 1848; alas!, it was doomed to bankruptcy a few
months later. He will find a company selling at only 2 times its last
reported earnings, and another selling at 99 times such earnings.3 In
most cases he will find it difficult to tell the line of business from
the corporate name; for one U.S. Steel there will be three called such
things as ITI Corp. (bakery stuff) or Santa Fe Industries (mainly the
large railroad). He can feast on an extraordinary variety of price
histories, dividend and earnings histories, financial positions,
capitalization setups, and what not. Backward-leaning conservatism,
run-of-the-mine featureless companies, the most peculiar combinations of
“principal business,” all kinds of Wall Street gadgets and widgets—they
are all there, waiting to be browsed over, or studied with a serious
objective.</p>
<p>The Guides give in separate columns the current dividend yields and
price/earnings ratios, based on latest 12-month figures, wherever
applicable. It is this last item that puts us on the track of our
exercise in common-stock selection.</p>
<p>A Winnowing of the Stock Guide</p>
<p>Suppose we look for a simple prima facie indication that a stock is
cheap. The first such clue that comes to mind is a low price in relation
to recent earnings. Let’s make a preliminary list of stocks that sold at
a multiple of nine or less at the end of 1970. That datum is
conveniently provided in the last column of the even-numbered pages. For
an illustrative sample we shall take the first 20 such low-multiplier
stocks; they begin with the sixth issue listed, Aberdeen Mfg. Co., which
closed the year at 10¼, or 9 times its reported earnings of .25 per
share for the 12 months ended September 1970. The twentieth such issue
is American Maize Products, which closed at 9½, also with a multiplier
of 9.</p>
<p>The group may have seemed mediocre, with 10 issues selling below 0
per share. (This fact is not truly important; it would probably—not
necessarily—warn defensive investors against such a list, but the
inference for enterprising investors might be favorable on balance.)*
Before making a further scrutiny let us calculate some numbers. Our list
represents about one in ten of the first 200 issues looked at. On that
basis the Guide should yield, say, 450 issues selling at multipliers
under 10. This would make a goodly number of candidates for further
selectivity.</p>
<p>So let us apply to our list some additional criteria, rather similar
to those we suggested for the defensive investor, but not so severe. We
suggest the following:</p>
<p>Financial condition: (a) Current assets at least 1½ times current
liabilities, and (b) debt not more than 110% of net current assets (for
industrial companies).</p>
<p>Earnings stability: No deficit in the last five years covered in the
Stock Guide.</p>
<p>Dividend record: Some current dividend.</p>
<p>Earnings growth: Last year’s earnings more than those of 1966.</p>
<p>Price: Less than 120% net tangible assets.</p>
<p>The earnings figures in the Guide were generally for those ending
September 30, 1970, and thus do not include what may be a bad quarter at
the end of that year. But an intelligent investor can’t ask for the
moon—at least not to start with. Note also that we set no lower limit on
the size of the enterprise. Small companies may afford enough safety if
bought carefully and on a group basis.</p>
<p>When we have applied the five additional criteria our list of 20
candidates is reduced to only five. Let us continue our search until the
first 450 issues in the Guide have yielded us a little “portfolio” of 15
stocks meeting our six requirements. (They are set forth in Table 15–1,
together with some relevant data.) The group, of course, is presented
for illustration only, and would not necessarily have been chosen by our
inquiring investor.</p>
<p>The fact is that the user of our method would have had a much wider
choice. If our winnowing approach had been applied to all 4,500
companies in the Stock Guide, and if the ratio for the first tenth had
held good throughout, we would end up with about 150 companies meeting
all six of our criteria of selection. The enterprising investor would
then be able to follow his judgment—or his partialities and
prejudices—in making a third selection of, say, one out of five in this
ample list.</p>
<p>The Stock Guide material includes “Earnings and Dividend Rankings,”
which are based on stability and growth of these factors for the past
eight years. (Thus price attractiveness does not enter here.) We include
the S andandandand P rankings in our Table 15-1. Ten of the 15 issues
are ranked B+ (= average) and one (American Maize) is given the “high”
rating of A. If our enterprising investor wanted to add a seventh
mechanical criterion to his choice, by considering only issues ranked by
Standard andandandand Poor’s as average or better in quality, he might
still have about 100 such issues to choose from. One might say that a
group of issues, of at least average quality, meeting criteria of
financial condition as well, purchasable at a low multiplier of current
earnings and below asset value, should offer good promise of
satisfactory investment results.</p>
<p>TABLE 15-1 A Sample Portfolio of Low-Multiplier Industrial</p>
<p>Single Criteria for Choosing Common Stocks</p>
<p>An inquiring reader might well ask whether the choice of a better
than average portfolio could be made a simpler affair than we have just
outlined. Could a single plausible criterion be used to good
advantage—such as a low price/earnings ratio, or a high dividend return,
or a large asset value? The two methods of this sort that we have found
to give quite consistently good results in the longer past have been (a)
the purchase of low-multiplier stocks of important companies (such as
the DJIA list), and (b) the choice of a diversified group of stocks
selling under their net-current-asset value (or working-capital value).
We have already pointed out that the low-multiplier criterion applied to
the DJIA at the end of 1968 worked out badly when the results are
measured to mid-1971. The record of common-stock purchases made at a
price below their working-capital value has no such bad mark against it;
the drawback here has been the drying up of such opportunities during
most of the past decade.</p>
<p>What about other bases of choice? In writing this book we have made a
series of “experiments,” each based on a single, fairly obvious
criterion. The data used would be readily found in the Standard
andandandand Poor’s Stock Guide. In all cases a 30-stock portfolio was
assumed to have been acquired at the 1968 closing prices and then
revalued at June 30, 1971. The separate criteria applied were the
following, as applied to otherwise random choices: (1) A low multiplier
of recent earnings (not confined to DJIA issues). (2) A high dividend
return. (3) A very long dividend record. (4) A very large enterprise, as
measured by number of outstanding shares. (5) A strong financial
position. (6) A low price in dollars per share. (7) A low price in
relation to the previous high price. (8) A high quality-ranking by
Standard andandandand Poor’s.</p>
<p>It will be noted that the Stock Guide has at least one column
relating to each of the above criteria. This indicates the publisher’s
belief that each is of importance in analyzing and choosing common
stocks. (As we pointed out above, we should like to see another figure
added: the net-asset-value per share.)</p>
<p>The most important fact that emerges from our various tests relates
to the performance of stocks bought at random. We have tested this
performance for three 30-stock portfolios, each made up of issues found
on the first line of the December 31, 1968, Stock Guide and also found
in the issue for August 31, 1971. Between these two dates the S
andandandand P composite was practically unchanged, and the DJIA lost
about 5%. But our 90 randomly chosen issues declined an average of 22%,
not counting 19 issues that were dropped from the Guide and probably
showed larger losses. These comparative results undoubtedly reflect the
tendency of smaller issues of inferior quality to be relatively
overvalued in bull markets, and not only to suffer more serious declines
than the stronger issues in the ensuing price collapse, but also to
delay their full recovery—in many cases indefinitely. The moral for the
intelligent investor is, of course, to avoid second-quality issues in
making up a portfolio, unless—for the enterprising investor—they are
demonstrable bargains.</p>
<p>Other results gleaned from our portfolio studies may be summarized as
follows:</p>
<p>Only three of the groups studied showed up better than the S
andandandand P composite (and hence better than the DJIA), viz: (1)
Industrials with the highest quality ranking (A+). These advanced 9½% in
the period against a decline of 2.4% for the S andandandand P
industrials, and 5.6% for the DJIA. (However, the ten public-utility
issues rated A+ declined 18% against a decline of 14% for the 55-stock S
andandandand P public-utility index.) It is worth remarking that the S
andandandand P rankings showed up very well in this single test. In
every case a portfolio based on a higher ranking did better than a
lower-ranking portfolio. (2) Companies with more than 50 million shares
outstanding showed no change on the whole, as against a small decline
for the indexes. (3) Strangely enough, stocks selling at a high price
per share (over 100) showed a slight (1%) composite advance.</p>
<p>Among our various tests we made one based on book value, a figure not
given in the Stock Guide. Here we found—contrary to our investment
philosophy—that companies that combined major size with a large
good-will component in their market price did very well as a whole in
the 2½-year holding period. (By “good-will component” we mean the part
of the price that exceeds the book value.)* Our list of “good-will
giants” was made up of 30 issues, each of which had a good-will
component of over a billion dollars, representing more than half of its
market price. The total market value of these good-will items at the end
of 1968 was more than 20 billions! Despite these optimistic market
valuations the group as a whole showed a price advance per share of 15%
between December 1968 and August 1971, and acquitted itself best among
the 20-odd lists studied.</p>
<p>A fact like this must not be ignored in a work on investment
policies. It is clear that, at the least, a considerable momentum is
attached to those companies that combine the virtues of great size, an
excellent past record of earnings, the public’s expectation of continued
earnings growth in the future, and strong market action over many past
years. Even if the price may appear excessive by our quantitative
standards the underlying market momentum may well carry such issues
along more or less indefinitely. (Naturally this assumption does not
apply to every individual issue in the category. For example, the
indisputable good-will leader, IBM, moved down from 315 to 304 in the
30-month period.) It is difficult to judge to what extent the superior
market action shown is due to “true” or objective investment merits and
to what extent to long-established popularity. No doubt both factors are
important here. Clearly, both the long-term and the recent market action
of the good-will giants would recommend them for a diversified portfolio
of common stocks. Our own preference, however, remains for other types
that show a combination of favorable investment factors, including asset
values of at least two-thirds the market price.</p>
<p>The tests using other criteria indicate in general that random lists
based on a single favorable factor did better than random lists chosen
for the opposite factor—e.g., low-multiplier issues had a smaller
decline in this period than high-multiplier issues, and long-term
dividend payers lost less than those that were not paying dividends at
the end of 1968. To that extent the results support our recommendation
that the issues selected meet a combination of quantitative or tangible
criteria.</p>
<p>Finally we should comment on the much poorer showing made by our
lists as a whole as compared with the price record of the S andandandand
P composite. The latter is weighted by the size of each enterprise,
whereas our tests are based on taking one share of each company.
Evidently the larger emphasis given to giant enterprises by the S
andandandand P method made a significant difference in the results, and
points up once again their greater price stability as compared with
“run-of-the-mine” companies.</p>
<p>Bargain Issues, or Net-Current-Asset Stocks</p>
<p>In the tests discussed above we did not include the results of buying
30 issues at a price less than their net-current-asset value. The reason
was that only a handful, at most, of such issues would have been found
in the Stock Guide at the end of 1968. But the picture changed in the
1970 decline, and at the low prices of that year a goodly number of
common stocks could have been bought at below their working-capital
value. It always seemed, and still seems, ridiculously simple to say
that if one can acquire a diversified group of common stocks at a price
less than the applicable net current assets alone—after deducting all
prior claims, and counting as zero the fixed and other assets—the
results should be quite satisfactory. They were so, in our experience,
for more than 30 years—say, between 1923 and 1957—excluding a time of
real trial in 1930–1932.</p>
<p>Has this approach any relevance at the beginning of 1971? Our answer
would be a qualified “yes.” A quick runover of the Stock Guide would
have uncovered some 50 or more issues that appeared to be obtainable at
or below net-current-asset value. As might be expected a good many of
these had been doing badly in the difficult year 1970. If we eliminated
those which had reported net losses in the last 12-month period we would
be still left with enough issues to make up a diversified list.</p>
<p>We have included in Table 15-2 some data on five issues that sold at
less than their working-capital value* at their low prices of 1970.
These give some food for reflection on the nature of stock-price
fluctuations. How does it come about that well-established companies,
whose brands are household names all over the country, could be valued
at such low figures—at the same time when other concerns (with better
earnings growth of course) were selling for billions of dollars in
excess of what their balance sheets showed? To quote the “old days” once
more, the idea of good will as an element of intangible value was
usually associated with a “trade name.” Names such as Lady Pepperell in
sheets, Jantzen in swim suits, and Parker in pens would be considered
assets of great value indeed. But now, if the “market doesn’t like a
company,” not only renowned trade names but land, buildings, machinery,
and what you will, can all count for nothing in its scales. Pascal said
that “the heart has its reasons that the reason doesn’t understand.”*
For “heart” read “Wall Street.”</p>
<p>TABLE 15-2 Stocks of Prominent Companies Selling at or Below
Net-Current-Asset Value in 1970</p>
<p>There is another contrast that comes to mind. When the going is good
and new issues are readily salable, stock offerings of no quality at all
make their appearance. They quickly find buyers; their prices are often
bid up enthusiastically right after issuance to levels in relation to
assets and earnings that would put IBM, Xerox, and Polaroid to shame.
Wall Street takes this madness in its stride, with no overt efforts by
anyone to call a halt before the inevitable collapse in prices. (The SEC
can’t do much more than insist on disclosure of information, about which
the speculative public couldn’t care less, or announce investigations
and usually mild punitive actions of various sorts after the letter of
the law has been clearly broken.) When many of these minuscule but
grossly inflated enterprises disappear from view, or nearly so, it is
all taken philosophically enough as “part of the game.” Everybody swears
off such inexcusable extravagances—until next time.</p>
<p>Thanks for the lecture, says the gentle reader. But what about your
“bargain issues”? Can one really make money in them without taking a
serious risk? Yes indeed, if you can find enough of them to make a
diversified group, and if you don’t lose patience if they fail to
advance soon after you buy them. Sometimes the patience needed may
appear quite considerable. In our previous edition we hazarded a single
example (p. 188) which was current as we wrote. It was Burton-Dixie
Corp., with stock selling at 20, against net-current-asset value of 30,
and book value of about 50. A profit on that purchase would not have
been immediate. But in August 1967 all the shareholders were offered 53
3/4 for their shares, probably at just about book value. A patient
holder, who had bought the shares in March 1964 at 20 would have had a
profit of 165% in 3½ years—a noncompounded annual return of 47%. Most of
the bargain issues in our experience have not taken that long to show
good profits–nor have they shown so high a rate. For a somewhat similar
situation, current as we write, see our discussion of National Presto
Industries above, p. 168.</p>
<p>Special Situations or “Workouts”</p>
<p>Let us touch briefly on this area, since it is theoretically
includable in the program of operations of an enterprising investor. It
was commented upon above. Here we shall supply some examples of the
genre, and some further remarks on what it appears to offer an
open-minded and alert investor.</p>
<p>Three such situations, among others, were current early in 1971, and
they may be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>SITUATION 1. Acquisition of Kayser-Roth by Borden’s. In January 1971
Borden Inc. announced a plan to acquire control of Kayser-Roth
(“diversified apparel”) by giving 1 1/3 shares of its own stock in
exchange for one share of Kayser-Roth. On the following day, in active
trading. Borden closed at 26 and Kayser-Roth at 28. If an “operator” had
bought 300 shares of Kayser-Roth and sold 400 Borden at these prices and
if the deal were later consummated on the announced terms, he would have
had a profit of some 24% on the cost of his shares, less commissions and
some other items. Assuming the deal had gone through in six months, his
final profit might have been at about a 40% per annum rate.</p>
<p>SITUATION 2. In November 1970 National Biscuit Co. offered to buy
control of Aurora Plastics Co. at 1 in cash. The stock was selling at
about 8½; it closed the month at 9 and continued to sell there at
year-end. Here the gross profit indicated was originally about 25%,
subject to the risks of nonconsummation and to the time element.</p>
<p>SITUATION 3. Universal-Marion Co., which had ceased its business
operations, asked its shareholders to ratify dissolution of the concern.
The treasurer indicated that the common stock had a book value of about
8½ per share, a substantial part of which was in liquid form. The stock
closed 1970 at 21½, indicating a possible gross profit here, if book
value was realized in liquidation, of more than 30%.</p>
<p>If operations of this kind, conducted on a diversified basis for
spreading the risk, could be counted to yield annual profits of, say,
20% or better, they would undoubtedly be more than merely worthwhile.
Since this is not a book on “special situations,” we are not going into
the details of the business—for it really is a business. Let us point
out two contradictory developments there in recent years. On the one
hand the number of deals to choose from has increased enormously, as
compared with, say, ten years ago. This is a consequence of what might
be called a mania of corporations to diversify their activities through
various types of acquisitions, etc. In 1970 the number of “merger
announcements” aggregated some 5,000, down from over 6,000 in 1969. The
total money values involved in these deals amounted to many, many
billions. Perhaps only a small fraction of the 5,000 announcements could
have presented a clear-cut opportunity for purchase of shares by a
special-situations man, but this fraction was still large enough to keep
him busy studying, picking, and choosing.</p>
<p>The other side of the picture is that an increasing proportion of the
mergers announced failed to be consummated. In such cases, of course,
the aimed-for profit is not realized, and is likely to be replaced by a
more or less serious loss. Reasons for nonsuccess are numerous,
including antitrust intervention, shareholder opposition, change in
“market conditions,” unfavorable indications from further study,
inability to agree on details, and others. The trick here, of course, is
to have the judgment, buttressed by experience, to pick the deals most
likely to succeed and also those which are likely to occasion the
smallest loss if they fail.*</p>
<p>Further Comment on the Examples Above</p>
<p>KAYSER-ROTH. The directors of this company had already rejected (in
January 1971) the Borden proposal when this chapter was written. If the
operation had been “undone” immediately the overall loss, including
commissions, would have been about 12% of the cost of the Kayser-Roth
shares.</p>
<p>AURORA PLASTICS. Because of the bad showing of this company in 1970
the takeover terms were renegotiated and the price reduced to 10½. The
shares were paid for at the end of May. The annual rate of return
realized here was about 25%.</p>
<p>UNIVERSAL-MARION. This company promptly made an initial distribution
in cash and stock worth about per share, reducing the investment to say
14½. However the market price fell as low as 13 subsequently, casting
doubt on the ultimate outcome of the liquidation.</p>
<p>Assuming that the three examples given are fairly representative of
“workout or arbitrage” opportunities as a whole in 1971, it is clear
that they are not attractive if entered into upon a random basis. This
has become more than ever a field for professionals, with the requisite
experience and judgment.</p>
<p>There is an interesting sidelight on our Kayser-Roth example. Late in
1971 the price fell below 20 while Borden was selling at 25, equivalent
to 33 for Kayser-Roth under the terms of the exchange offer. It would
appear that either the directors had made a great mistake in turning
down that opportunity or the shares of Kayser-Roth were now badly
undervalued in the market. Something for a security analyst to look
into.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 15</p>
<p>It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy
in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the
midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of
solitude.</p>
<p>—Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
<p>Practice, Practice, Practice</p>
<p>Max Heine, founder of the Mutual Series Funds, liked to say that
“there are many roads to Jerusalem.” What this masterly stock picker
meant was that his own value-centered method of selecting stocks was not
the only way to be a successful investor. In this chapter we’ll look at
several techniques that some of today’s leading money managers use for
picking stocks.</p>
<p>First, though, it’s worth repeating that for most investors,
selecting individual stocks is unnecessary—if not inadvisable. The fact
that most professionals do a poor job of stock picking does not mean
that most amateurs can do better. The vast majority of people who try to
pick stocks learn that they are not as good at it as they thought; the
luckiest ones discover this early on, while the less fortunate take
years to learn it. A small percentage of investors can excel at picking
their own stocks. Everyone else would be better off getting help,
ideally through an index fund.</p>
<p>Graham advised investors to practice first, just as even the greatest
athletes and musicians practice and rehearse before every actual
performance. He suggested starting off by spending a year tracking and
picking stocks (but not with real money). 1 In Graham’s day, you would
have practiced using a ledger of hypothetical buys and sells on a legal
pad; nowadays, you can use “portfolio trackers” at websites like
www.morningstar.com, http://finance.yahoo.com, http://money.cnn.
com/services/portfolio/ or www.marketocracy.com (at the last site,
ignore the “market-beating” hype on its funds and other services).</p>
<p>By test-driving your techniques before trying them with real money,
you can make mistakes without incurring any actual losses, develop the
discipline to avoid frequent trading, compare your approach against
those of leading money managers, and learn what works for you. Best of
all, tracking the outcome of all your stock picks will prevent you from
forgetting that some of your hunches turn out to be stinkers. That will
force you to learn from your winners and your losers. After a year,
measure your results against how you would have done if you had put all
your money in an S andandandand P 500 index fund. If you didn’t enjoy
the experiment or your picks were poor, no harm done—selecting
individual stocks is not for you. Get yourself an index fund and stop
wasting your time on stock picking.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed the experiment and earned sufficiently good returns,
gradually assemble a basket of stocks—but limit it to a maximum of 10%
of your overall portfolio (keep the rest in an index fund). And
remember, you can always stop if it no longer interests you or your
returns turn bad.</p>
<p>Looking Under the Right Rocks</p>
<p>So how should you go about looking for a potentially rewarding stock?
You can use websites like http://finance.yahoo.com and
www.morningstar.com to screen stocks with the statistical filters
suggested in Chapter 14. Or you can take a more patient, craftsmanlike
approach. Unlike most people, many of the best professional investors
first get interested in a company when its share price goes down, not
up. Christopher Browne of Tweedy Browne Global Value Fund, William
Nygren of the Oakmark Fund, Robert Rodriguez of FPA Capital Fund, and
Robert Torray of the Torray Fund all suggest looking at the daily list
of new 52-week lows in the Wall Street Journal or the similar table in
the “Market Week” section of Barron’s. That will point you toward stocks
and industries that are unfashionable or unloved and that thus offer the
potential for high returns once perceptions change.</p>
<p>Christopher Davis of the Davis Funds and William Miller of Legg Mason
Value Trust like to see rising returns on invested capital, or ROIC—a
way of measuring how efficiently a company generates what Warren Buffett
has called “owner earnings.”2 (See the sidebar on p. 398 for more
detail.)</p>
<p>FROM EPS TO ROIC</p>
<p>Net income or earnings per share (EPS) has been distorted in recent
years by factors like stock-option grants and accounting gains and
charges. To see how much a company is truly earning on the capital it
deploys in its businesses, look beyond EPS to ROIC, or return on
invested capital. Christopher Davis of the Davis Funds defines it with
this formula:</p>
<p>ROIC = Owner Earnings Invested Capital,</p>
<p>where Owner Earnings is equal to:</p>
<p>Operating profit</p>
<p>plus depreciation</p>
<p>plus amortization of goodwill</p>
<p>minus Federal income tax (paid at the company’s average rate)</p>
<p>minus cost of stock options</p>
<p>minus “maintenance” (or essential) capital expenditures</p>
<p>minus any income generated by unsustainable rates of return on
pension funds (as of 2003, anything greater than 6.5%)</p>
<p>and where Invested Capital is equal to:</p>
<p>Total assets</p>
<p>minus cash (as well as short-term investments and
non-interest-bearing current liabilities)</p>
<p>plus past accounting charges that reduced invested capital.</p>
<p>ROIC has the virtue of showing, after all legitimate expenses, what
the company earns from its operating businesses—and how efficiently it
has used the shareholders’ money to generate that return. An ROIC of at
least 10% is attractive; even 6% or 7% can be tempting if the company
has good brand names, focused management, or is under a temporary
cloud.</p>
<p>By checking “comparables,” or the prices at which similar businesses
have been acquired over the years, managers like Oakmark’s Nygren and
Longleaf Partners’ O. Mason Hawkins get a better handle on what a
company’s parts are worth. For an individual investor, it’s painstaking
and difficult work: Start by looking at the “Business Segments” footnote
in the company’s annual report, which typically lists the industrial
sector, revenues, and earnings of each subsidiary. (The “Management
Discussion and Analysis” may also be helpful.) Then search a news
database like Factiva, ProQuest, or LexisNexis for examples of other
firms in the same industries that have recently been acquired. Using the
EDGAR database at www.sec.gov to locate their past annual reports, you
may be able to determine the ratio of purchase price to the earnings of
those acquired companies. You can then apply that ratio to estimate how
much a corporate acquirer might pay for a similar division of the
company you are investigating.</p>
<p>By separately analyzing each of the company’s divisions this way, you
may be able to see whether they are worth more than the current stock
price. Longleaf’s Hawkins likes to find what he calls “60-cent dollars,”
or companies whose stock is trading at 60% or less of the value at which
he appraises the businesses. That helps provide the margin of safety
that Graham insists on.</p>
<p>Who’s the Boss?</p>
<p>Finally, most leading professional investors want to see that a
company is run by people who, in the words of Oakmark’s William Nygren,
“think like owners, not just managers.” Two simple tests: Are the
company’s financial statements easily understandable, or are they full
of obfuscation? Are “nonrecurring” or “extraordinary” or “unusual”
charges just that, or do they have a nasty habit of recurring?</p>
<p>Longleaf’s Mason Hawkins looks for corporate managers who are “good
partners”—meaning that they communicate candidly about problems, have
clear plans for allocating current and future cash flow, and own sizable
stakes in the company’s stock (preferably through cash purchases rather
than through grants of options). But “if managements talk more about the
stock price than about the business,” warns Robert Torray of the Torray
Fund, “we’re not interested.” Christopher Davis of the Davis Funds
favors firms that limit issuance of stock options to roughly 3% of
shares outstanding.</p>
<p>At Vanguard Primecap Fund, Howard Schow tracks “what the company said
one year and what happened the next. We want to see not only whether
managements are honest with shareholders but also whether they’re honest
with themselves.” (If a company boss insists that all is hunky-dory when
business is sputtering, watch out!) Nowadays, you can listen in on a
company’s regularly scheduled conference calls even if you own only a
few shares; to find out the schedule, call the investor relations
department at corporate headquarters or visit the company’s website.</p>
<p>Robert Rodriguez of FPA Capital Fund turns to the back page of the
company’s annual report, where the heads of its operating divisions are
listed. If there’s a lot of turnover in those names in the first one or
two years of a new CEO’s regime, that’s probably a good sign; he’s
cleaning out the dead wood. But if high turnover continues, the
turnaround has probably devolved into turmoil.</p>
<p>Keeping Your Eyes on the Road</p>
<p>There are even more roads to Jerusalem than these. Some leading
portfolio managers, like David Dreman of Dreman Value Management and
Martin Whitman of the Third Avenue Funds, focus on companies selling at
very low multiples of assets, earnings, or cash flow. Others, like
Charles Royce of the Royce Funds and Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity
Low-Priced Stock Fund, hunt for undervalued small companies. And, for an
all-too-brief look at how today’s most revered investor, Warren Buffett,
selects companies, see the sidebar on p. 401.</p>
<p>One technique that can be helpful: See which leading professional
money managers own the same stocks you do. If one or two names keep
turning up, go to the websites of those fund companies and download
their most recent reports. By seeing which other stocks these investors
own, you can learn more about what qualities they have in common; by
reading the managers’ commentary, you may get ideas on how to improve
your own approach.3</p>
<p>WARREN’S WAY</p>
<p>Graham’s greatest student, Warren Buffett, has become the world’s
most successful investor by putting new twists on Graham’s ideas.
Buffett and his partner, Charles Munger, have combined Graham’s “margin
of safety” and detachment from the market with their own innovative
emphasis on future growth. Here is an all-too-brief summary of Buffett’s
approach:</p>
<p>He looks for what he calls “franchise” companies with strong consumer
brands, easily understandable businesses, robust financial health, and
near-monopolies in their markets, like H andandandand R Block, Gillette,
and the Washington Post Co. Buffett likes to snap up a stock when a
scandal, big loss, or other bad news passes over it like a storm
cloud—as when he bought Coca-Cola soon after its disastrous rollout of
“New Coke” and the market crash of 1987. He also wants to see managers
who set and meet realistic goals; build their businesses from within
rather than through acquisition; allocate capital wisely; and do not pay
themselves hundred-million-dollar jackpots of stock options. Buffett
insists on steady and sustainable growth in earnings, so the company
will be worth more in the future than it is today.</p>
<p>In his annual reports, archived at www.berkshirehathaway. com,
Buffett has set out his thinking like an open book. Probably no other
investor, Graham included, has publicly revealed more about his approach
or written such compellingly readable essays. (One classic Buffett
proverb: “When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a
business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of
the business that remains intact.”) Every intelligent investor can—and
should—learn by reading this master’s own words.</p>
<p>No matter which techniques they use in picking stocks, successful
investing professionals have two things in common: First, they are
disciplined and consistent, refusing to change their approach even when
it is unfashionable. Second, they think a great deal about what they do
and how to do it, but they pay very little attention to what the market
is doing.</p>
