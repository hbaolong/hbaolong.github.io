<h4 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h4>
<p>Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor</p>
<p>It is time to turn to some broader applications of the techniques of
security analysis. Since we have already described in general terms the
investment policies recommended for our two categories of investors,* it
would be logical for us now to indicate how security analysis comes into
play in order to implement these policies. The defensive investor who
follows our suggestions will purchase only high-grade bonds plus a
diversified list of leading common stocks. He is to make sure that the
price at which he bought the latter is not unduly high as judged by
applicable standards.</p>
<p>In setting up this diversified list he has a choice of two
approaches, the DJIA-type of portfolio and the quantitatively-tested
portfolio. In the first he acquires a true cross-section sample of the
leading issues, which will include both some favored growth companies,
whose shares sell at especially high multipliers, and also less popular
and less expensive enterprises. This could be done, most simply perhaps,
by buying the same amounts of all thirty of the issues in the DowJones
Industrial Average (DJIA). Ten shares of each, at the 900 level for the
average, would cost an aggregate of about 6,000.1 On the basis of the
past record he might expect approximately the same future results by
buying shares of several representative investment funds.†</p>
<p>His second choice would be to apply a set of standards to each
purchase, to make sure that he obtains (1) a minimum of quality in the
past performance and current financial position of the company, and also
(2) a minimum of quantity in terms of earnings and assets per dollar of
price. At the close of the previous chapter we listed seven such quality
and quantity criteria suggested for the selection of specific common
stocks. Let us describe them in order.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Adequate Size of the Enterprise</li>
</ol>
<p>All our minimum figures must be arbitrary and especially in the
matter of size required. Our idea is to exclude small companies which
may be subject to more than average vicissitudes especially in the
industrial field. (There are often good possibilities in such
enterprises but we do not consider them suited to the needs of the
defensive investor.) Let us use round amounts: not less than 00 million
of annual sales for an industrial company and, not less than 0 million
of total assets for a public utility.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>A Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition</li>
</ol>
<p>For industrial companies current assets should be at least twice
current liabilities—a so-called two-to-one current ratio. Also,
long-term debt should not exceed the net current assets (or “working
capital”). For public utilities the debt should not exceed twice the
stock equity (at book value).</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Earnings Stability</li>
</ol>
<p>Some earnings for the common stock in each of the past ten years.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Dividend Record</li>
</ol>
<p>Uninterrupted payments for at least the past 20 years.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Earnings Growth</li>
</ol>
<p>A minimum increase of at least one-third in per-share earnings in the
past ten years using three-year averages at the beginning and end.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Moderate Price/Earnings Ratio</li>
</ol>
<p>Current price should not be more than 15 times average earnings of
the past three years.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets</li>
</ol>
<p>Current price should not be more than 1½ times the book value last
reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a
correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we
suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to
book value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15 times
earnings and 1½ times book value. It would admit an issue selling at
only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)</p>
<p>GENERAL COMMENTS: These requirements are set up especially for the
needs and the temperament of defensive investors. They will eliminate
the great majority of common stocks as candidates for the portfolio, and
in two opposite ways. On the one hand they will exclude companies that
are (1) too small, (2) in relatively weak financial condition, (3) with
a deficit stigma in their ten-year record, and (4) not having a long
history of continuous dividends. Of these tests the most severe under
recent financial conditions are those of financial strength. A
considerable number of our large and formerly strongly entrenched
enterprises have weakened their current ratio or overexpanded their
debt, or both, in recent years.</p>
<p>Our last two criteria are exclusive in the opposite direction, by
demanding more earnings and more assets per dollar of price than the
popular issues will supply. This is by no means the standard viewpoint
of financial analysts; in fact most will insist that even conservative
investors should be prepared to pay generous prices for stocks of the
choice companies. We have expounded our contrary view above; it rests
largely on the absence of an adequate factor of safety when too large a
portion of the price must depend on ever-increasing earnings in the
future. The reader will have to decide this important question for
himself—after weighing the arguments on both sides.</p>
<p>We have nonetheless opted for the inclusion of a modest requirement
of growth over the past decade. Without it the typical company would
show retrogression, at least in terms of profit per dollar of invested
capital. There is no reason for the defensive investor to include such
companies—though if the price is low enough they could qualify as
bargain opportunities.</p>
<p>The suggested maximum figure of 15 times earnings might well result
in a typical portfolio with an average multiplier of, say, 12 to 13
times. Note that in February 1972 American Tel. andandandand Tel. sold
at 11 times its three-year (and current) earnings, and Standard Oil of
California at less than 10 times latest earnings. Our basic
recommendation is that the stock portfolio, when acquired, should have
an overall earnings/price ratio—the reverse of the P/E ratio—at least as
high as the current high-grade bond rate. This would mean a P/E ratio no
higher than 13.3 against an AA bond yield of 7.5%.*</p>
<p>Application of Our Criteria to the DJIA at the End of 1970</p>
<p>All of our suggested criteria were satisfied by the DJIA issues at
the end of 1970, but two of them just barely. Here is a survey based on
the closing price of 1970 and the relevant figures. (The basic data for
each company are shown in Tables 14-1 and 14-2.)</p>
<p>Size is more than ample for each company.</p>
<p>Financial condition is adequate in the aggregate, but not for every
company.2</p>
<p>Some dividend has been paid by every company since at least 1940.
Five of the dividend records go back to the last century.</p>
<p>The aggregate earnings have been quite stable in the past decade.
None of the companies reported a deficit during the prosperous period
1961–69, but Chrysler showed a small deficit in 1970.</p>
<p>The total growth—comparing three-year averages a decade apart—was
77%, or about 6% per year. But five of the firms did not grow by
one-third.</p>
<p>The ratio of year-end price to three-year average earnings was 839 to
5.5 or 15 to 1—right at our suggested upper limit.</p>
<p>The ratio of price to net asset value was 839 to 562—also just within
our suggested limit of 1½ to 1.</p>
<p>TABLE 14-1 Basic Data on 30 Stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average at September 30, 1971</p>
<p>If, however, we wish to apply the same seven criteria to each
individual company, we would find that only five of them would meet all
our requirements. These would be: American Can, American Tel.
andandandand Tel., Anaconda, Swift, and Woolworth. The totals for these
five appear in Table 14-3. Naturally they make a much better statistical
showing than the DJIA as a whole, except in the past growth rate.3</p>
<p>Our application of specific criteria to this select group of
industrial stocks indicates that the number meeting every one of our
tests will be a relatively small percentage of all listed industrial
issues. We hazard the guess that about 100 issues of this sort could
have been found in the Standard andandandand Poor’s Stock Guide at the
end of 1970, just about enough to provide the investor with a
satisfactory range of personal choice.*</p>
<p>The Public-Utility “Solution”</p>
<p>If we turn now to the field of public-utility stocks we find a much
more comfortable and inviting situation for the investor.† Here the vast
majority of issues appear to be cut out, by their performance record and
their price ratios, in accordance with the defensive investor’s needs as
we judge them. We exclude one criterion from our tests of public-utility
stocks—namely, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. The
working-capital factor takes care of itself in this industry as part of
the continuous financing of its growth by sales of bonds and shares. We
do require an adequate proportion of stock capital to debt.4</p>
<p>In Table 14-4 we present a résumé of the 15 issues in the Dow Jones
public-utility average. For comparison, Table 14-5 gives a similar
picture of a random selection of fifteen other utilities taken from the
New York Stock Exchange list.</p>
<p>As 1972 began the defensive investor could have had quite a wide
choice of utility common stocks, each of which would have met our
requirements for both performance and price. These companies offered him
everything he had a right to demand from simply chosen common-stock
investments. In comparison with prominent industrial companies as
represented by the DJIA, they offered almost as good a record of past
growth, plus smaller fluctuations in the annual figures—both at a lower
price in relation to earnings and assets. The dividend return was
significantly higher. The position of the utilities as regulated
monopolies is assuredly more of an advantage than a disadvantage for the
conservative investor. Under law they are entitled to charge rates
sufficiently remunerative to attract the capital they need for their
continuous expansion, and this implies adequate offsets to inflated
costs. While the process of regulation has often been cumbersome and
perhaps dilatory, it has not prevented the utilities from earning a fair
return on their rising invested capital over many decades.</p>
<p>For the defensive investor the central appeal of the public-utility
stocks at this time should be their availability at a moderate price in
relation to book value. This means that he can ignore stockmarket
considerations, if he wishes, and consider himself primarily as a part
owner of well-established and well-earning businesses. The market
quotations are always there for him to take advantage of when times are
propitious—either for purchases at unusually attractive low levels, or
for sales when their prices seem definitely too high.</p>
<p>The market record of the public-utility indexes—condensed in Table
14-6, along with those of other groups—indicates that there have been
ample possibilities of profit in these investments in the past. While
the rise has not been as great as in the industrial index, the
individual utilities have shown more price stability in most periods
than have other groups.* It is striking to observe in this table that
the relative price/earnings ratios of the industrials and the utilities
have changed places during the past two decades. These reversals will
have more meaning for the active than for the passive investor. But they
suggest that even defensive portfolios should be changed from time to
time, especially if the securities purchased have an apparently
excessive advance and can be replaced by issues much more reasonably
priced. Alas! there will be capital-gains taxes to pay—which for the
typical investor seems to be about the same as the Devil to pay. Our old
ally, experience, tells us here that it is better to sell and pay the
tax than not sell and repent.</p>
<p>TABLE 14-6 Development of Prices and Price/Earnings Ratios for
Various Standard andandandand Poor’s Averages,</p>
<p>Investing in Stocks of Financial Enterprises</p>
<p>A considerable variety of concerns may be ranged under the rubric of
“financial companies.” These would include banks, insurance companies,
savings and loan associations, credit and small-loan companies, mortgage
companies, and “investment companies” (e.g., mutual funds).* It is
characteristic of all these enterprises that they have a relatively
small part of their assets in the form of material things—such as fixed
assets and merchandise inventories—but on the other hand most categories
have short-term obligations well in excess of their stock capital. The
question of financial soundness is, therefore, more relevant here than
in the case of the typical manufacturing or commercial enterprise. This,
in turn, has given rise to various forms of regulation and supervision,
with the design and general result of assuring against unsound financial
practices.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the shares of financial concerns have produced
investment results similar to those of other types of common shares.
Table 14-7 shows price changes between 1948 and 1970 in six groups
represented in the Standard andandandand Poor’s stock-price indexes. The
average for 1941–1943 is taken as 10, the base level. The year-end 1970
figures ranged between 44.3 for the 9 New York banks and 218 for the 11
life-insurance stocks. During the subintervals there was considerable
variation in the respective price movements. For example, the New York
City bank stocks did quite well between 1958 and 1968; conversely the
spectacular life-insurance group actually lost ground between 1963 and
1968. These cross-movements are found in many, perhaps most, of the
numerous industry groups in the Standard andandandand Poor’s
indexes.</p>
<p>TABLE 14-7 Relative Price Movements of Stocks of Various</p>
<p>We have no very helpful remarks to offer in this broad area of
investment—other than to counsel that the same arithmetical standards
for price in relation to earnings and book value be applied to the
choice of companies in these groups as we have suggested for industrial
and public-utility investments.</p>
<p>Railroad Issues</p>
<p>The railroad story is a far different one from that of the utilities.
The carriers have suffered severely from a combination of severe
competition and strict regulation. (Their labor-cost problem has of
course been difficult as well, but that has not been confined to
railroads.) Automobiles, buses, and airlines have drawn off most of
their passenger business and left the rest highly unprofitable; the
trucks have taken a good deal of their freight traffic. More than half
of the railroad mileage of the country has been in bankruptcy (or
“trusteeship”) at various times during the past 50 years.</p>
<p>But this half-century has not been all downhill for the carriers.
There have been prosperous periods for the industry, especially the war
years. Some of the lines have managed to maintain their earning power
and their dividends despite the general difficulties.</p>
<p>The Standard andandandand Poor’s index advanced sevenfold from the
low of 1942 to the high of 1968, not much below the percentage gain in
the public-utility index. The bankruptcy of the Penn Central
Transportation Co., our most important railroad, in 1970 shocked the
financial world. Only a year and two years previously the stock sold at
close to the highest price level in its long history, and it had paid
continuous dividends for more than 120 years! (On p. 423 below we
present a brief analysis of this railroad to illustrate how a competent
student could have detected the developing weaknesses in the company’s
picture and counseled against ownership of its securities.) The market
level of railroad shares as a whole was seriously affected by this
financial disaster.</p>
<p>It is usually unsound to make blanket recommendations of whole
classes of securities, and there are equal objections to broad
condemnations. The record of railroad share prices in Table 14-6 shows
that the group as a whole has often offered chances for a large profit.
(But in our view the great advances were in themselves largely
unwarranted.) Let us confine our suggestion to this: There is no
compelling reason for the investor to own railroad shares; before he
buys any he should make sure that he is getting so much value for his
money that it would be unreasonable to look for something else
instead.*</p>
<p>Selectivity for the Defensive Investor</p>
<p>Every investor would like his list to be better or more promising
than the average. Hence the reader will ask whether, if he gets himself
a competent adviser or security analyst, he should not be able to count
on being supplied with an investment package of really superior merits.
“After all,” he may say, “the rules you have outlined are pretty simple
and easygoing. A highly trained analyst ought to be able to use all his
skill and techniques to improve substantially on something as obvious as
the Dow Jones list. If not, what good are all his statistics,
calculations, and pontifical judgments?”</p>
<p>Suppose, as a practical test, we had asked a hundred security
analysts to choose the “best” five stocks in the Dow Jones Average, to
be bought at the end of 1970. Few would have come up with identical
choices and many of the lists would have differed completely from each
other.</p>
<p>This is not so surprising as it may at first appear. The underlying
reason is that the current price of each prominent stock pretty well
reflects the salient factors in its financial record plus the general
opinion as to its future prospects. Hence the view of any analyst that
one stock is a better buy than the rest must arise to a great extent
from his personal partialities and expectations, or from the placing of
his emphasis on one set of factors rather than on another in his work of
evaluation. If all analysts were agreed that one particular stock was
better than all the rest, that issue would quickly advance to a price
which would offset all of its previous advantages.*</p>
<p>Our statement that the current price reflects both known facts and
future expectations was intended to emphasize the double basis for
market valuations. Corresponding with these two kinds of value elements
are two basically different approaches to security analysis. To be sure,
every competent analyst looks forward to the future rather than backward
to the past, and he realizes that his work will prove good or bad
depending on what will happen and not on what has happened.
Nevertheless, the future itself can be approached in two different ways,
which may be called the way of prediction (or projection) and the way of
protection. *</p>
<p>Those who emphasize prediction will endeavor to anticipate fairly
accurately just what the company will accomplish in future years—in
particular whether earnings will show pronounced and persistent growth.
These conclusions may be based on a very careful study of such factors
as supply and demand in the industry—or volume, price, and costs—or else
they may be derived from a rather naïve projection of the line of past
growth into the future. If these authorities are convinced that the
fairly long-term prospects are unusually favorable, they will almost
always recommend the stock for purchase without paying too much regard
to the level at which it is selling. Such, for example, was the general
attitude with respect to the air-transport stocks—an attitude that
persisted for many years despite the distressingly bad results often
shown after 1946. In the Introduction we have commented on the disparity
between the strong price action and the relatively disappointing
earnings record of this industry.</p>
<p>By contrast, those who emphasize protection are always especially
concerned with the price of the issue at the time of study. Their main
effort is to assure themselves of a substantial margin of indicated
present value above the market price—which margin could absorb
unfavorable developments in the future. Generally speaking, therefore,
it is not so necessary for them to be enthusiastic over the company’s
long-run prospects as it is to be reasonably confident that the
enterprise will get along.</p>
<p>The first, or predictive, approach could also be called the
qualitative approach, since it emphasizes prospects, management, and
other nonmeasurable, albeit highly important, factors that go under the
heading of quality. The second, or protective, approach may be called
the quantitative or statistical approach, since it emphasizes the
measurable relationships between selling price and earnings, assets,
dividends, and so forth. Incidentally, the quantitative method is really
an extension—into the field of common stocks—of the viewpoint that
security analysis has found to be sound in the selection of bonds and
preferred stocks for investment.</p>
<p>In our own attitude and professional work we were always committed to
the quantitative approach. From the first we wanted to make sure that we
were getting ample value for our money in concrete, demonstrable terms.
We were not willing to accept the prospects and promises of the future
as compensation for a lack of sufficient value in hand. This has by no
means been the standard viewpoint among investment authorities; in fact,
the majority would probably subscribe to the view that prospects,
quality of management, other intangibles, and “the human factor” far
outweigh the indications supplied by any study of the past record, the
balance sheet, and all the other cold figures.</p>
<p>Thus this matter of choosing the “best” stocks is at bottom a highly
controversial one. Our advice to the defensive investor is that he let
it alone. Let him emphasize diversification more than individual
selection. Incidentally, the universally accepted idea of
diversification is, in part at least, the negation of the ambitious
pretensions of selectivity. If one could select the best stocks
unerringly, one would only lose by diversifying. Yet within the limits
of the four most general rules of common-stock selection suggested for
the defensive investor (on pp. 114–115) there is room for a rather
considerable freedom of preference. At the worst the indulgence of such
preferences should do no harm; beyond that, it may add something
worthwhile to the results. With the increasing impact of technological
developments on long-term corporate results, the investor cannot leave
them out of his calculations. Here, as elsewhere, he must seek a mean
between neglect and overemphasis.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 14</p>
<p>He that resteth upon gains certain, shall hardly grow to great
riches; and he that puts all upon adventures, doth oftentimes break and
come to poverty: it is good therefore to guard adventures with
certainties that may uphold losses.</p>
<p>—Sir Francis Bacon</p>
<p>Getting Started</p>
<p>How should you tackle the nitty-gritty work of stock selection?
Graham suggests that the defensive investor can, “most simply,” buy
every stock in the DowJones Industrial Average. Today’s defensive
investor can do even better—by buying a total stock-market index fund
that holds essentially every stock worth having. A low-cost index fund
is the best tool ever created for low-maintenance stock investing—and
any effort to improve on it takes more work (and incurs more risk and
higher costs) than a truly defensive investor can justify.</p>
<p>Researching and selecting your own stocks is not necessary; for most
people, it is not even advisable. However, some defensive investors do
enjoy the diversion and intellectual challenge of picking individual
stocks—and, if you have survived a bear market and still enjoy stock
picking, then nothing that Graham or I could say will dissuade you. In
that case, instead of making a total stock market index fund your
complete portfolio, make it the foundation of your portfolio. Once you
have that foundation in place, you can experiment around the edges with
your own stock choices. Keep 90% of your stock money in an index fund,
leaving 10% with which to try picking your own stocks. Only after you
build that solid core should you explore. (To learn why such broad
diversification is so important, please see the sidebar on the following
page.)</p>
<p>WHY DIVERSIFY?</p>
<p>During the bull market of the 1990s, one of the most common
criticisms of diversification was that it lowers your potential for high
returns. After all, if you could identify the next Microsoft, wouldn’t
it make sense for you to put all your eggs into that one basket?</p>
<p>Well, sure. As the humorist Will Rogers once said, “Don’t gamble.
Take all your savings and buy some good stock and hold it till it goes
up, then sell it. If it don’t go up, don’t buy it.”</p>
<p>However, as Rogers knew, 20/20 foresight is not a gift granted to
most investors. No matter how confident we feel, there’s no way to find
out whether a stock will go up until after we buy it. Therefore, the
stock you think is “the next Microsoft” may well turn out to be the next
MicroStrategy instead. (That former market star went from ,130 per share
in March 2000 to 5.10 at year-end 2002, an apocalyptic loss of 99.5%).1
Keeping your money spread across many stocks and industries is the only
reliable insurance against the risk of being wrong.</p>
<p>But diversification doesn’t just minimize your odds of being wrong.
It also maximizes your chances of being right. Over long periods of
time, a handful of stocks turn into “superstocks” that go up 10,000% or
more. Money Magazine identified the 30 best-performing stocks over the
30 years ending in 2002—and, even with 20/20 hindsight, the list is
startlingly unpredictable. Rather than lots of technology or health-care
stocks, it includes Southwest Airlines, Worthington Steel, Dollar
General discount stores, and snuff-tobacco maker UST Inc.2 If you think
you would have been willing to bet big on any of those stocks back in
1972, you are kidding yourself.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: In the huge market haystack, only a few needles
ever go on to generate truly gigantic gains. The more of the haystack
you own, the higher the odds go that you will end up finding at least
one of those needles. By owning the entire haystack (ideally through an
index fund that tracks the total U.S. stock market) you can be sure to
find every needle, thus capturing the returns of all the superstocks.
Especially if you are a defensive investor, why look for the needles
when you can own the whole haystack?</p>
<p>Testing, Testing</p>
<p>Let’s briefly update Graham’s criteria for stock selection.</p>
<p>Adequate size. Nowadays, “to exclude small companies,” most defensive
investors should steer clear of stocks with a total market value of less
than billion. In early 2003, that still left you with 437 of the
companies in the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index to choose
from.</p>
<p>However, today’s defensive investors—unlike those in Graham’s day—can
conveniently own small companies by buying a mutual fund specializing in
small stocks. Again, an index fund like Vanguard Small-Cap Index is the
first choice, although active funds are available at reasonable cost
from such firms as Ariel, T. Rowe Price, Royce, and Third Avenue.</p>
<p>Strong financial condition. According to market strategists Steve
Galbraith and Jay Lasus of Morgan Stanley, at the beginning of 2003
about 120 of the companies in the S andandandand P 500 index met
Graham’s test of a 2-to-1 current ratio. With current assets at least
twice their current liabilities, these firms had a sizeable cushion of
working capital that—on average—should sustain them through hard
times.</p>
<p>Wall Street has always abounded in bitter ironies, and the bursting
of the growth-stock bubble has created a doozy: In 1999 and 2000,
high-tech, bio-tech, and telecommunications stocks were supposed to
provide “aggressive growth” and ended up giving most of their investors
aggressive shrinkage instead. But, by early 2003, the wheel had come
full circle, and many of those aggressive growth stocks had become
financially conservative—loaded with working capital, rich in cash, and
often debt-free. This table provides a sampler:</p>
<p>FIGURE 14-1 Everything New Is Old Again</p>
<p>All figures in millions of dollars from latest available financial
statements as of 12/31/02. Working capital is current assets minus
current liabilities. Long-term debt includes preferred stock, excludes
deferred tax liabilities. Sources: Morgan Stanley; Baseline; EDGAR
database at www.sec.gov.</p>
<p>In 1999, most of these companies were among the hottest of the
market’s darlings, offering the promise of high potential growth. By
early 2003, they offered hard evidence of true value.</p>
<p>The lesson here is not that these stocks were “a sure thing,” or that
you should rush out and buy everything (or anything) in this table.1
Instead, you should realize that a defensive investor can always prosper
by looking patiently and calmly through the wreckage of a bear market.
Graham’s criterion of financial strength still works: If you build a
diversified basket of stocks whose current assets are at least double
their current liabilities, and whose long-term debt does not exceed
working capital, you should end up with a group of conservatively
financed companies with plenty of staying power. The best values today
are often found in the stocks that were once hot and have since gone
cold. Throughout history, such stocks have often provided the margin of
safety that a defensive investor demands.</p>
<p>Earnings stability. According to Morgan Stanley, 86% of all the
companies in the S andandandand P 500 index have had positive earnings
in every year from 1993 through 2002. So Graham’s insistence on “some
earnings for the common stock in each of the past ten years” remains a
valid test—tough enough to eliminate chronic losers, but not so
restrictive as to limit your choices to an unrealistically small
sample.</p>
<p>Dividend record. As of early 2003, according to Standard andandandand
Poor’s, 354 companies in the S andandandand P 500 (or 71% of the total)
paid a dividend. No fewer than 255 companies have paid a dividend for at
least 20 years in a row. And, according to S andandandand P, 57
companies in the index have raised their dividends for at least 25
consecutive years. That’s no guarantee that they will do so forever, but
it’s a comforting sign.</p>
<p>Earnings growth. How many companies in the S andandandand P 500
increased their earnings per share by “at least one third,” as Graham
requires, over the 10 years ending in 2002? (We’ll average each
company’s earnings from 1991 through 1993, and then determine whether
the average earnings from 2000 through 2002 were at least 33% higher.)
According to Morgan Stanley, 264 companies in the S andandandand P 500
met that test. But here, it seems, Graham set a very low hurdle; 33%
cumulative growth over a decade is less than a 3% average annual
increase. Cumulative growth in earnings per share of at least 50%—or a
4% average annual rise—is a bit less conservative. No fewer than 245
companies in the S andandandand P 500 index met that criterion as of
early 2003, leaving the defensive investor an ample list to choose from.
(If you double the cumulative growth hurdle to 100%, or 7% average
annual growth, then 198 companies make the cutoff.)</p>

<p>Moderate P/E ratio. Graham recommends limiting yourself to stocks
whose current price is no more than 15 times average earnings over the
past three years. Incredibly, the prevailing practice on Wall Street
today is to value stocks by dividing their current price by something
called “next year’s earnings.” That gives what is sometimes called “the
forward P/E ratio.” But it’s nonsensical to derive a price/earnings
ratio by dividing the known current price by unknown future earnings.
Over the long run, money manager David Dreman has shown, 59% of Wall
Street’s “consensus” earnings forecasts miss the mark by a mortifyingly
wide margin—either underestimating or overestimating the actual reported
earnings by at least 15%.2 Investing your money on the basis of what
these myopic soothsayers predict for the coming year is as risky as
volunteering to hold up the bulls-eye at an archery tournament for the
legally blind. Instead, calculate a stock’s price/earnings ratio
yourself, using Graham’s formula of current price divided by average
earnings over the past three years.3</p>
<p>As of early 2003, how many stocks in the Standard andandandand Poor’s
500 index were valued at no more than 15 times their average earnings of
2000 through 2002? According to Morgan Stanley, a generous total of 185
companies passed Graham’s test.</p>
<p>Moderate price-to-book ratio. Graham recommends a “ratio of price to
assets” (or price-to-book-value ratio) of no more than 1.5. In recent
years, an increasing proportion of the value of companies has come from
intangible assets like franchises, brand names, and patents and
trademarks. Since these factors (along with goodwill from acquisitions)
are excluded from the standard definition of book value, most companies
today are priced at higher price-to-book multiples than in Graham’s day.
According to Morgan Stanley, 123 of the companies in the S andandandand
P 500 (or one in four) are priced below 1.5 times book value. All told,
273 companies (or 55% of the index) have price-to-book ratios of less
than 2.5.</p>
<p>What about Graham’s suggestion that you multiply the P/E ratio by the
price-to-book ratio and see whether the resulting number is below 22.5?
Based on data from Morgan Stanley, at least 142 stocks in the S
andandandand P 500 could pass that test as of early 2003, including Dana
Corp., Electronic Data Systems, Sun Microsystems, and Washington Mutual.
So Graham’s “blended multiplier” still works as an initial screen to
identify reasonably-priced stocks.</p>
<p>Due Diligence</p>
<p>No matter how defensive an investor you are—in Graham’s sense of
wishing to minimize the work you put into picking stocks—there are a
couple of steps you cannot afford to skip:</p>
<p>Do your homework. Through the EDGAR database at www.sec. gov, you get
instant access to a company’s annual and quarterly reports, along with
the proxy statement that discloses the managers’ compensation,
ownership, and potential conflicts of interest. Read at least five
years’ worth.4</p>
<p>Check out the neighborhood. Websites like http://quicktake.
morningstar.com, http://finance.yahoo.com and www.quicken.com can
readily tell you what percentage of a company’s shares are owned by
institutions. Anything over 60% suggests that a stock is scarcely
undiscovered and probably “overowned.” (When big institutions sell, they
tend to move in lockstep, with disastrous results for the stock. Imagine
all the Radio City Rockettes toppling off the front edge of the stage at
once and you get the idea.) Those websites will also tell you who the
largest owners of the stock are. If they are money-management firms that
invest in a style similar to your own, that’s a good sign.</p>
