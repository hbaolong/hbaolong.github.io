<ol type="1">
<li><p>His thesis was that savings of only 5 per month invested in good
common stocks—with dividends reinvested—would produce an estate of 0,000
in twenty years against total contributions of only ,600. If the General
Motors tycoon was right, this was indeed a simple road to riches. How
nearly right was he? Our rough calculation—based on assumed investment
in the 30 stocks making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(DJIA)—indicates that if Raskob’s prescription had been followed during
1929–1948, the investor’s holdings at the beginning of 1949 would have
been worth about ,500. This is a far cry from the great man’s promise of
0,000, and it shows how little reliance can be placed on such optimistic
forecasts and assurances. But, as an aside, we should remark that the
return actually realized by the 20-year operation would have been better
than 8% compounded annually—and this despite the fact that the investor
would have begun his purchases with the DJIA at 300 and ended with a
valuation based on the 1948 closing level of 177. This record may be
regarded as a persuasive argument for the principle of regular monthly
purchases of strong common stocks through thick and thin—a program known
as “dollar-cost averaging.”</p></li>
<li><p>The reason for this seemingly outmoded counsel is both practical
and psychological. Experience has taught us that, while there are many
good growth companies worth several times net assets, the buyer of such
shares will be too dependent on the vagaries and fluctuations of the
stock market. By contrast, the investor in shares, say, of
public-utility companies at about their net-asset value can always
consider himself the owner of an interest in sound and expanding
businesses, acquired at a rational price—regardless of what the stock
market might say to the contrary. The ultimate result of such a
conservative policy is likely to work out better than exciting
adventures into the glamorous and dangerous fields of anticipated
growth.</p></li>

<li><p>/</p></li>
<li><p>His thesis was that</p></li>
<li><p>The reason for this seemingly</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>It is indeed ironical (though not surprising) that common-stock
purchases of all kinds were quite generally regarded as highly
speculative or risky at a time when they were selling on a most
attractive basis, and due soon to begin their greatest advance in
history; conversely the very fact they had advanced to what were
undoubtedly dangerous levels as judged by past experience later
transformed them into “investments,” and the entire stock-buying public
into “investors.”</p></li>
<li><p>There is intelligent speculation as there is intelligent
investing. But there are many ways in which speculation may be
unintelligent. Of these the foremost are: (1) speculating when you think
you are investing; (2) speculating seriously instead of as a pastime,
when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it; and (3) risking more
money in speculation than you can afford to lose.</p></li>
<li><p>Almost always bonds have fluctuated much less than stock prices,
and investors generally could buy good bonds of any maturity without
having to worry about changes in their market value. There were a few
exceptions to this rule, and the period after 1964 proved to be one of
them. We shall have more to say about change in bond prices in a later
chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>On an after-tax basis the average return on stocks would work out
at some 5.3%.5 This would be about the same as is now obtainable on good
tax-free medium-term bonds.</p></li>
<li><p>There is the alternative possibility—which we also consider
highly unlikely—that American business will become so profitable,
without stepped-up inflation, as to justify a large increase in
common-stock values in the next few years. Finally, there is the more
familiar possibility that we shall witness another great speculative
rise in the stock market without a real justification in the underlying
values. Any of these reasons, and perhaps others we haven’t thought of,
might cause the investor to regret a 100% concentration on bonds even at
their more favorable yield levels.</p></li>
<li><p>But the major point here is that the defensive investor’s overall
results are not likely to be decisively different from one diversified
or representative list than from another, or—more accurately—that
neither he nor his advisers could predict with certainty whatever
differences would ultimately develop. It is true that the art of
skillful or shrewd investment is supposed to lie particularly in the
selection of issues that will give better results than the general
market. For reasons to be developed elsewhere we are skeptical of the
ability of defensive investors generally to get better than average
results—which in fact would mean to beat their own overall
performance.</p></li>
<li><p>The principle is sound, its successful application is not
impossible, but it is distinctly not an easy art to master.</p></li>
<li><p>And it had the advantage of running directly counter to the
ingrained and pernicious maxim of Wall Street that stocks should be
bought because they have gone up and sold because they have gone down.
Alas, after 1949 this formula no longer worked. A second illustration is
provided by the famous “Dow Theory” of stock-market movements, in a
comparison of its indicated splendid results for 1897–1933 and its much
more questionable performance since 1934.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li><p>This is quite a reversal from the earlier days when trust
investments were restricted by law to high-grade bonds (and a few choice
preferred stocks).</p></li>
<li><p>We think it would be reasonable for an investor at this point to
base his thinking and decisions on a probable (far from certain) rate of
future inflation of, say, 3% per annum. (This would compare with an
annual rate of about 2½% for the entire period 1915–1970.)1</p></li>
<li><p>that the investor may assume an average dividend return of about
3.5% on the market value of his stocks, plus an appreciation of, say, 4%
annually resulting from reinvested profits. (Note that each dollar added
to book value is here assumed to increase the market price by about
.60.)</p></li>
<li><p>This means, first, that the common-stock buyer at today’s
prices—or tomorrow’s—will be running a real risk of having
unsatisfactory results therefrom over a period of years. It took 25
years for General Electric (and the DJIA itself) to recover the ground
lost in the 1929–1932 debacle. Besides that, if the investor
concentrates his portfolio on common stocks he is very likely to be led
astray either by exhilarating advances or by distressing declines. This
is particularly true if his reasoning is geared closely to expectations
of further inflation. For then, if another bull market comes along, he
will take the big rise not as a danger signal of an inevitable fall, not
as a chance to cash in on his handsome profits, but rather as a
vindication of the inflation hypothesis and as a reason to keep on
buying common stocks no matter how high the market level nor how low the
dividend return. That way lies sorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Quite a few categories of valuable objects have had striking
advances in market value over the years—such as diamonds, paintings by
masters, first editions of books, rare stamps and coins, etc. But in
many, perhaps most, of these cases there seems to be an element of the
artificial or the precarious or even the unreal about the quoted prices.
Somehow it is hard to think of paying 7,500 for a U.S. silver dollar
dated 1804 (but not even minted that year) as an “investment
operation.”4 We acknowledge we are out of our depth in this area. Very
few of our readers will find the swimming safe and easy there.</p></li>

<ol start="20" type="1">
<li><p>2 It created a natural satisfaction on Wall Street with such fine
achievements, and a quite illogical and dangerous conviction that
equally marvelous results could be expected for common stocks in the
future. Few people seem to have been bothered by the thought that the
very extent of the rise might indicate that it had been overdone. The
subsequent decline from the 1968 high to the 1970 low was 36% for the
Standard andandandand Poor’s composite (and 37% for the DJIA), the
largest since the 44% suffered in 1939–1942, which had reflected the
perils and uncertainties after Pearl Harbor. In the dramatic manner so
characteristic of Wall Street, the low level of May 1970 was followed by
a massive and speedy recovery of both averages, and the establishment of
a new all-time high for the Standard andandandand Poor’s industrials in
early 1972. The annual rate of price advance between 1949 and 1970 works
out at about 9% for the S andandandand P composite (or the industrial
index), using the average figures for both years. That rate of climb
was, of course, much greater than for any similar period before 1950.
(But in the last decade the rate of advance was much lower—5¼% for the S
andandandand P composite index and only the once familiar 3% for the
DJIA.)</p></li>

<li><p>He should divide his funds between high-grade bonds and
high-grade common stocks.</p></li>
<li><p>at a discount rather than a high-coupon bond selling at about par
and callable in a few years. For the discount—e.g., of a 3½% bond at
63½%, yielding 7.85%—carries full protection against adverse call
action.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h4>
<ol start="24" type="1">
<li><p>Common stocks were generally viewed as highly speculative and
therefore unsafe; they had declined fairly substantially from the high
levels of 1946, but instead of attracting investors to them because of
their reasonable prices, this fall had had the opposite effect of
undermining confidence in equity securities. We have commented on the
converse situation that has developed in the ensuing 20 years, whereby
the big advance in stock prices made them appear safe and profitable
investments at record high levels which might actually carry with them a
considerable degree of risk.†</p></li>
<li><p>Since 1957 common stocks have once again, through their high
prices, lost their traditional advantage in dividend yield over bond
interest rates.† It remains to be seen whether the inflation factor and
the economic-growth factor will make up in the future for this
significantly adverse development.</p></li>
<li><p>we feel that the defensive investor cannot afford to be without
an appreciable proportion of common stocks in his portfolio, even if he
must regard them as the lesser of two evils—the greater being the risks
attached to an all-bond holding.</p></li>
<li><p>that this “best of common stocks” actually lost 50% of its market
price in a six-months’ decline during 1961–62 and nearly the same
percentage in 1969–70. Other growth stocks have been even more
vulnerable to adverse developments; in some cases not only has the price
fallen back but the earnings as well, thus causing a double discomfiture
to those who owned them. A good second example for our purpose is Texas
Instruments, which in six years rose from 5 to 256, without paying a
dividend, while its earnings increased from 40 cents to .91 per share.
(Note that the price advanced five times as fast as the profits; this is
characteristic of popular common stocks.) But two years later the
earnings had dropped off by nearly 50% and the price by four-fifths, to
49.†</p></li>

public. We shall illustrate this idea in our chapter on portfolio
selection.</p></li>

<li><p>He will be prepared to branch out into other kinds of security
commitments, but in each case he will want a well-reasoned justification
for the departure. There is a difficulty in discussing this topic in
orderly fashion, because there is no single or ideal pattern for
aggressive operations. The field of choice is wide; the selection should
depend not only on the individual’s competence and equipment but perhaps
equally well upon his interests and preferences.</p></li>
<li><p>He will let someone else buy foreign-government bond issues, even
though the yield may be attractive. He will also be wary of all kinds of
new issues, including convertible bonds and preferreds that seem quite
tempting and common stocks with excellent earnings confined to the
recent past.</p></li>
<li><p>(Here the word “merely” implies that the issue is not selling at
a large discount and thus does not offer an opportunity for a
substantial gain in principal value.) Where such securities are bought
at full prices—that is, not many points under 100</p></li>
<li><p>The second is that most new issues are sold under “favorable
market conditions”—which means favorable for the seller and consequently
less favorable for the buyer.†</p></li>
<li><p>The sale of the new shares is almost always under-written by one
or more investment banking houses, but it is the general hope and
expectation that all the new shares will be taken by the exercise of the
subscription rights. Thus the sale of additional common stock of listed
companies does not ordinarily call for active selling effort on the part
of distributing firms.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h4>
<ol start="36" type="1">
<li><p>This is one in which the excellent prospects are fully recognized
in the market and already reflected in a current price-earnings ratio
of, say, higher than 20. (For the defensive investor we suggested an
upper limit of purchase price at 25 times average earnings of the past
seven years. The two criteria would be about equivalent in most
cases.)†</p></li>
<li><p>Each decline—however temporary it proves in the sequel—will
accentuate his problem; and internal and external pressures are likely
to force him to take what seems to be a goodly profit, but one far less
than the ultimate bonanza.4</p></li>
<li><p>of one-year holding—from 1937 through 1969—the cheap stocks did
definitely worse than the DJIA in only three instances; the results were
about the same in six cases; and the cheap stocks clearly outperformed
the average in 25 years. The consistently better performance of the
low-multiplier stocks is shown (Table 7-2) by the average results for
successive five-year periods, when compared with those of the DJIA and
of the ten high-multipliers.</p></li>
<li><p>Even a mere lack of interest or enthusiasm may impel a price
decline to absurdly low levels. Thus we have what appear to be two major
sources of undervaluation: (1) currently disappointing results and (2)
protracted neglect or unpopularity.</p></li>
<li><p>This would mean that the buyer would pay nothing at all for the
fixed assets—buildings, machinery, etc., or any good-will items that
might exist. Very few companies turn out to have an ultimate value less
than the working capital alone, although scattered instances may be
found. The surprising thing, rather, is that there have been so many
enterprises obtainable which have been valued in the market on this
bargain basis. A compilation made in 1957, when the market’s level was
by no means low, disclosed about 150 of such common stocks. In Table 7-4
we summarize the result of buying, on December 31, 1957, one share of
each of the 85 companies in that list for which data appeared in
Standard andandandand Poor’s Monthly Stock Guide, and holding them for
two years.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<ol start="41" type="1">
<li><p>Briefly, this technique takes its signal to buy from a special
kind of “breakthrough” of the stock averages on the up side, and its
selling signal from a similar breakthrough on the down side. The
calculated—not necessarily actual—results of using this method showed an
almost unbroken series of profits in operations from 1897 to the early
1960s. On the basis of this presentation the practical value of the Dow
theory would have appeared firmly established; the doubt, if any, would
apply to the dependability of this published “record” as a picture of
what a Dow theorist would actually have done in the market.</p></li>
<li><p>Even in 1949, therefore, it was by no means a certainty that the
investor could base his financial policies and procedures mainly on the
endeavor to buy at low levels in bear markets and to sell out at high
levels in bull markets.</p></li>
<li><p>fluctuate more widely than the major ones, but this does not
necessarily mean that a group of well-established but smaller companies
will make a poorer showing over a fairly long period. In any case the
investor may as well resign himself in advance to the probability rather
than the mere possibility that most of his holdings will advance, say,
50% or more from their low point and decline the equivalent one-third or
more from their high point at various periods in the next five
years.†</p></li>
<li><p>(What we have said applies to a comparison of the leading growth
companies with the bulk of well-established concerns; we exclude from
our purview here those issues which are highly speculative because the
businesses themselves are speculative.)</p></li>
<li><p>Thus the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly
worried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely
transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That man
would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he
would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by other persons’
mistakes of judgment.†</p></li>
<li><p>Twenty-five years earlier, just before our protracted bull market
began, bond yields were at their lowest point in history; long-term
municipals returned as little as 1%, and industrials gave 2.40% compared
with the 4½ to 5% formerly considered “normal.” Those of us with a long
experience on Wall Street had seen Newton’s law of “action and reaction,
equal and opposite” work itself out repeatedly in the stock market—the
most noteworthy example being the rise in the DJIA from 64 in 1921 to
381 in 1929, followed by a record collapse to 41 in 1932. But this time
the widest pendulum swings took place in the usually staid and
slow-moving array of high-grade bond prices and yields. Moral: Nothing
important on Wall Street can be counted on to occur exactly in the same
way as it happened before. This represents the first half of our
favorite dictum: “The more it changes, the more it’s the same
thing.”</p></li>
<li><p>In the old days, at least, one could often find a useful clue to
the coming end of a bull or bear market by studying the prior action of
bonds, but no similar clues were given to a coming change in interest
rates and bond prices. Hence the investor must choose between long-term
and short-term bond investments on the basis chiefly of his personal
preferences. If he wants to be certain that the market values will not
decrease, his best choices are probably U.S. savings bonds, Series E or
H, which were described above, p. 93. Either issue will give him a 5%
yield (after the first year), the Series E for up to 5 5/6 years, the
Series H for up to ten years, with a guaranteed resale value of cost or
better.</p></li>

<li><p>Another is by their objectives, as their primary aim is for
income, price stability, or capital appreciation (“growth”). Another
distinction is by their method of sale. “Load funds” add a selling
charge (generally about 9% of asset value on minimum purchases) to the
value before charge.1 Others, known as “no-load” funds, make no such
charge; the managements are content with the usual investment-counsel
fees for handling the capital. Since they cannot pay salesmen’s
commissions, the size of the no-load funds tends to be on the low side.†
The buying and selling prices of the closed-end funds are not fixed by
the companies, but fluctuate in the open market as does the ordinary
corporate stock.</p></li>
<li><p>A second point is that the funds’ aggregate performance as
against the S andandandand P index has improved somewhat in the last
five years, compared with the preceding five. The funds’ gain ran a
little lower than S andandandand P’s in 1961–1965 and a little higher
than S andandandand P’s in 1966–1970. The third point is that a wide
difference exists between the results of the individual funds.</p></li>
<li><p>A third extraordinary fact was that the founder-manager of
Manhattan Fund sold his stock in a separately organized management
company to another large concern for over 0 million in its stock; at
that time the management company sold had less than million in assets.
This is undoubtedly one of the greatest disparities of all times between
the results for the “manager” and the “managees.”</p></li>
<li><p>About a half century ago the “miracles” were often accompanied by
flagrant manipulation, misleading corporate reporting, outrageous
capitalization structures, and other semifraudulent financial practices.
All this brought on an elaborate system of financial controls by the
SEC, as well as a cautious attitude toward common stocks on the part of
the general public. The operations of the new “money managers” in
1965–1969 came a little more than one full generation after the
shenanigans of 1926–1929.† The specific malpractices banned after the
1929 crash were no longer resorted to—they involved the risk of jail
sentences. But in many corners of Wall Street they were replaced by
newer gadgets and gimmicks that produced very similar results in the
end. Outright manipulation of prices disappeared, but there were many
other methods of drawing the gullible public’s attention to the profit
possibilities in “hot” issues. Blocks of “letter stock”3 could be bought
well below the quoted market price, subject to undisclosed restrictions
on their sale; they could immediately be carried in the reports at their
full market value, showing a lovely and illusory profit. And so on. It
is amazing how, in a completely different atmosphere of regulation and
prohibitions, Wall Street was able to duplicate so much of the excesses
and errors of the 1920s.</p></li>

<li><p>The miscellaneous character of this list suggests that no logical
or systematic approach in this matter has crystallized, as yet, in the
minds of investors.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the first time in half a century or more that such a
thing has happened, and it is startling for more than one reason. For
many decades the New York Stock Exchange has been moving in the
direction of closer and stricter controls over the operations and
financial condition of its members—including minimum capital
requirements, surprise audits, and the like. Besides this, we have had
37 years of control over the exchanges and their members by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, the stock-brokerage
industry itself has operated under favorable conditions—namely, a huge
increase in volume, fixed minimum commission rates (largely eliminating
competitive fees), and a limited number of member firms.</p></li>

<h4 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h4>
<ol start="54" type="1">
<li><p>They also have their share of unresolved problems. In recent
years there has been a tendency to replace the general concept of
“security analysis” by that of “financial analysis.” The latter phrase
has a broader implication and is better suited to describe the work of
most senior analysts on Wall Street. It would be useful to think of
security analysis as limiting itself pretty much to the examination and
evaluation of stocks and bonds, whereas financial analysis would
comprise that work, plus the determination of investment policy
(portfolio selection), plus a substantial amount of general economic
analysis.1 In this chapter we shall use whatever designation is most
applicable, with chief emphasis on the work of the security analyst
proper.</p></li>
<li><p>to the total face amount of the debt, or the debt plus preferred
stock. It is a rough measure of the protection, or “cushion,” afforded
by the presence of a junior investment that must first bear the brunt of
unfavorable developments. This factor includes the market’s appraisal of
the future prospects of the enterprise.</p></li>
<li><p>along with the breakup of most of the holding-company systems,
public-utility financing has been sound and bankruptcies unknown. The
financial troubles of electric and gas utilities in the 1930s were
traceable almost 100% to financial excesses and mismanagement, which
left their imprint clearly on the companies’ capitalization structures.
Simple but stringent tests of safety, therefore, would have warned the
investor away from the issues that were later to default.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the dividend bears a normal relationship to the earnings,
the valuation may be made on either basis without substantially
affecting the result. For example, a typical secondary company with
expected average earnings of and an expected dividend of may be valued
at either 12 times its earnings or 18 times its dividend, to yield a
value of 36 in both cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Such assumptions have always been difficult to make with any
degree of confidence, and the recent violent swings in long-term
interest rates render forecasts of this sort almost presumptuous. Hence
we have retained our old formula above, simply because no new one would
appear more plausible.</p></li>
<li><p>or where the margin of safety of past-performance value over
current price is so large that he can take his chances on future
variations—as he does in selecting well-secured senior
securities.</p></li>

<li><p>The company was planning to write off, as a special charge, not
less than 64 million in one fell swoop. Of this, 00 million represents
the loss to be taken on the proposed sale of the railroad subsidiary to
its employees and the balance a write-down of a recent stock purchase.
These sums would work out to a loss of about 5 per share of common
before dilution offsets, or twice its then current market price. Here we
have something really significant. If the transaction goes through, and
if the tax laws are not changed, this loss provided for in 1970 will
permit Northwest Industries to realize about 00 million of future
profits (within five years) from its other diversified interests without
paying income tax thereon.</p></li>
<li><p>was useful for ironing out the frequent ups and downs of the
business cycle, and it was thought to give a better idea of the
company’s earning power than the results of the latest year alone. One
important advantage of such an averaging process is that it will solve
the problem of what to do about nearly all the special charges and
credits. They should be included in the average earnings. For certainly
most of these losses and gains represent a part of the company’s
operating history. If we do this for ALCOA, the average earnings for
1961–1970 (ten years) would appear as .62 and for the seven years
1964–1970 as .62 per share. If such figures are used in conjunction with
ratings for growth and stability of earnings during the same period,
they could give a really informing picture of the company’s past
performance.</p></li>
<li><p>had been only average or less, and this may be the decisive
factor here. High multipliers have been maintained in the stock market
only if the company has maintained better than average
profitability.</p></li>
<li><p>Such an approach might have produced a “past-performance value”
for ALCOA of 10% of the DJIA, or 4 per share relative to the closing
price of 840 for the DJIA in 1970. On this basis the shares would have
appeared quite attractive at their price of 57¼.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h4>
<ol start="64" type="1">
<li><p>There are some broad resemblances between the three manufacturing
firms, but the differences will seem more significant. There should be
sufficient variety in the financial and operating data to make the
examination of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>All the companies except Emery showed better earnings on book
value in 1969 than in 1961; but the Emery figure was exceptionally large
in both years. (b) For manufacturing companies, the profit figure per
dollar of sales is usually an indication of comparative strength or
weakness. We use here the “ratio of operating income to sales,” as given
in Standard andandandand Poor’s Listed Stock Reports. Here again the
results are satisfactory for all four companies, with an especially
impressive showing by Emerson. The changes between 1961 and 1969 vary
considerably among the companies.</p></li>
<li><p>These manifold price advances are characteristic of most of our
older common-stock issues, and they proclaim the great opportunities of
profit that have existed in the stock markets of the past. (But they may
indicate also how overdone were the declines in the bear markets before
1950 when the low prices were registered.) Both ELTRA and Emhart
sustained price shrinkages of more than 50% in the 1969–70 price break.
Emerson and Emery had serious, but less distressing, declines; the
former rebounded to a new all-time high before the end of 1970, the
latter in early 1971.</p></li>
<li><p>It is one of our “good-will giants,” to be commented on later. A
financial analyst blessed (or handicapped) with a good memory will think
of an analogy between Emerson Electric and Zenith Radio, and that would
not be reassuring. For Zenith had a brilliant growth record for many
years; it too sold in the market for .7 billion (in 1966); but its
profits fell from 3 million in 1968 to only half as much in 1970, and in
that year’s big selloff its price declined to 22½ against the previous
top of 89. High valuations entail high risks.</p></li>
<li><p>The same cautionary statements seem called for in the case of
Emerson Electric, with a special reference to the market’s current
valuation of over a billion dollars for the intangible, or
earning-power, factor here. We should add that the “electronics
industry,” once a fair-haired child of the stock market, has in general
fallen on disastrous days. Emerson is an outstanding exception, but it
will have to continue to be such an exception for a great many years in
the future before the 1970 closing price will have been fully justified
by its subsequent performance.</p></li>
<li><p>The rate of earnings on invested capital has long been
satisfactory; the stability of profits also; the past growth rate
surprisingly so. The two companies will meet our seven statistical
requirements for inclusion in a defensive investor’s portfolio. These
will be developed in the next chapter, but we summarize them as
follows:</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h4>
<ol start="70" type="1">
<li><p>it would be logical for us now to indicate how security analysis
comes into play in order to implement these policies. The defensive
investor who follows our suggestions will purchase only high-grade bonds
plus a diversified list of leading common stocks. He is to make sure
that the price at which he bought the latter is not unduly high as
judged by applicable standards.</p></li>
<li><p>It is striking to observe in this table that the relative
price/earnings ratios of the industrials and the utilities have changed
places during the past two decades. These reversals will have more
meaning for the active than for the passive investor. But they suggest
that even defensive portfolios should be changed from time to time,
especially if the securities purchased have an apparently excessive
advance and can be replaced by issues much more reasonably priced. Alas!
there will be capital-gains taxes to pay—which for the typical investor
seems to be about the same as the Devil to pay. Our old ally,
experience, tells us here that it is better to sell and pay the tax than
not sell and repent.</p></li>
<li><p>It is characteristic of all these enterprises that they have a
relatively small part of their assets in the form of material
things—such as fixed assets and merchandise inventories—but on the other
hand most categories have short-term obligations well in excess of their
stock capital. The question of financial soundness is, therefore, more
relevant here than in the case of the typical manufacturing or
commercial enterprise. This, in turn, has given rise to various forms of
regulation and supervision, with the design and general result of
assuring against unsound financial practices.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h4>
<ol start="73" type="1">
<li><p>In both cases a study of the results realized by us over a period
of ten years or more led us to conclude that the profits were not
sufficiently dependable—and the operations not sufficiently “headache
proof”—to justify our continuing them.</p></li>
<li><p>If he looks at the Guide for the year-end 1969 he will read that
Penn Central Co. (as successor to Pennsylvania Railroad) has been paying
dividends steadily since 1848; alas!, it was doomed to bankruptcy a few
months later. He will find a company selling at only 2 times its last
reported earnings, and another selling at 99 times such earnings.3 In
most cases he will find it difficult to tell the line of business from
the corporate name; for one U.S. Steel there will be three called such
things as ITI Corp. (bakery stuff) or Santa Fe Industries (mainly the
large railroad). He can feast on an extraordinary variety of price
histories, dividend and earnings histories, financial positions,
capitalization setups, and what not. Backward-leaning conservatism,
run-of-the-mine featureless companies, the most peculiar combinations of
“principal business,” all kinds of Wall Street gadgets and widgets—they
are all there, waiting to be browsed over, or studied with a serious
objective.</p></li>
<li><p>Before making a further scrutiny let us calculate some numbers.
Our list represents about one in ten of the first 200 issues looked at.
On that basis the Guide should yield, say, 450 issues selling at
multipliers under 10. This would make a goodly number of candidates for
further selectivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Our list of “good-will giants” was made up of 30 issues, each of
which had a good-will component of over a billion dollars, representing
more than half of its market price. The total market value of these
good-will items at the end of 1968 was more than 20 billions! Despite
these optimistic market valuations the group as a whole showed a price
advance per share of 15% between December 1968 and August 1971, and
acquitted itself best among the 20-odd lists studied.</p></li>
<li><p>at their low prices of 1970. These give some food for reflection
on the nature of stock-price fluctuations. How does it come about that
well-established companies, whose brands are household names all over
the country, could be valued at such low figures—at the same time when
other concerns (with better earnings growth of course) were selling for
billions of dollars in excess of what their balance sheets showed? To
quote the “old days” once more, the idea of good will as an element of
intangible value was usually associated with a “trade name.” Names such
as Lady Pepperell in sheets, Jantzen in swim suits, and Parker in pens
would be considered assets of great value indeed. But now, if the
“market doesn’t like a company,” not only renowned trade names but land,
buildings, machinery, and what you will, can all count for nothing in
its scales. Pascal said that “the heart has its reasons that the reason
doesn’t understand.”</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h4>
<ol start="78" type="1">
<li><p>Hence that other famous dictum of the old-timers: “Do as I say,
not as I do.”</p></li>
<li><p>But there are two offsetting factors, one of which is practically
ignored and the other entirely so in optimistic markets. The first is
the actual dilution of the current and future earnings on the common
stock that flows arithmetically from the new conversion rights. This
dilution can be quantified by taking the recent earnings, or assuming
some other figures, and calculating the adjusted earnings per share if
all the convertible shares or bonds were actually converted. In the
majority of companies the resulting reduction in per-share figures is
not significant. But there are numerous exceptions to this statement,
and there is danger that they will grow at an uncomfortable rate. The
fast-expanding “conglomerates” have been the chief practitioners of
convertible legerdemain. In Table 16-3 we list seven companies with
large amounts of stock issuable on conversions or against
warrants.†</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the poet’s remarks apply equally well to one invention or
another—such as the following (in Bayard Taylor’s translation):</p></li>
<li><p>Once born they function as other security forms, and offer
chances of profit as well as of loss. Nearly all the newer warrants run
for a limited time—generally between five and ten years. The older
warrants were often perpetual, and they were likely to have fascinating
price histories over the years.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham detested warrants, as he makes clear on
pp. 413–416.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is pointing out that, despite the promotional rhetoric
that investors usually hear, convertible bonds do not automatically
offer “the best of both worlds.” Higher yield and lower risk do not
always go hand in hand. What Wall Street gives with one hand, it usually
takes away with the other. An investment may offer the best of one
world, or the worst of another; but the best of both worlds seldom
becomes available in a single package.</p></li>
<li><p>Recent structural changes in the convertible market have negated
some of these criticisms. Convertible preferred stock, which made up
roughly half the total convertible market in Graham’s day, now accounts
for only an eighth of the market. Maturities are shorter, making
convertible bonds less volatile, and many now carry “call protection,”
or assurances against early redemption. And more than half of all
convertibles are now investment grade, a significant improvement in
credit quality from Graham’s time. Thus, in 2002, the Merrill Lynch All
U.S. Convertible Index lost 8.6%—versus the 22.1% loss of the S
andandandand P 500-stock index and the 31.3% decline in the NASDAQ
Composite stock index.</p></li>
<li><p>A bond is “called” when the issuing corporation forcibly pays it
off ahead of the stated maturity date, or final due date for interest
payments. For a brief summary of how convertible bonds work, see Note 1
in the commentary on this chapter (p. 418).</p></li>
<li><p>In recent years, convertibles have tended to outperform the
Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index during declining stock
markets, but they have typically underperformed other bonds—which
weakens, but does not fully negate, the criticism Graham makes
here.</p></li>
<li><p>This sentence could serve as the epitaph for the bull market of
the 1990s. Among the “few prudent principles” that investors forgot were
such market clichés as “Trees don’t grow to the sky” and “Bulls make
money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered.”</p></li>
<li><p>ATandandandandT Corp. no longer is a significant issuer of
convertible bonds. Among the largest issuers of convertibles today are
General Motors, Merrill Lynch, Tyco International, and Roche.</p></li>
<li><p>For a further discussion of “pro forma” financial results, see
the commentary on Chapter 12.</p></li>
<li><p>Warrants were an extremely widespread technique of corporate
finance in the nineteenth century and were fairly common even in
Graham’s day. They have since diminished in importance and
popularity—one of the few recent developments that would give Graham
unreserved pleasure. As of year-end 2002, there were only seven
remaining warrant issues on the New York Stock Exchange—only the ghostly
vestige of a market. Because warrants are no longer commonly used by
major companies, today’s investors should read the rest of Graham’s
chapter only to see how his logic works.</p></li>
<li><p>Today, the last remnant of activity in warrants is in the
cesspool of the NASDAQ “bulletin board,” or over-the-counter market for
tiny companies, where common stock is often bundled with warrants into a
“unit” (the contemporary equivalent of what Graham calls a “package”).
If a stockbroker ever offers to sell you “units” in any company, you can
be 95% certain that warrants are involved, and at least 90% certain that
the broker is either a thief or an idiot. Legitimate brokers and firms
have no business in this area.</p></li>
<li><p>The “notorious French assignats” were issued during the
Revolution of 1789. They were originally debts of the Revolutionary
government, purportedly secured by the value of the real estate that the
radicals had seized from the Catholic church and the nobility. But the
Revolutionaries were bad financial managers. In 1790, the interest rate
on assignats was cut; soon they stopped paying interest entirely and
were reclassified as paper money. But the government refused to redeem
them for gold or silver and issued massive amounts of new assignats.
They were officially declared worthless in 1797.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham, an enthusiastic reader of Spanish literature, is
paraphrasing a line from the play Life Is a Dream by Pedro Calderon de
la Barca (1600–1681): “The greatest crime of man is having been
born.”</p></li>

<li><p>had reported “earnings” of .80 a share—in reflection of which the
common stock later rose to its peak of 86½. This was a valuation of over
billion for the equity. How many of these buyers knew at the time that
the so lovely earnings were before a special charge of 75 million or 2
per share to be taken in 1971 for “costs and losses” incurred on the
merger. O wondrous fairyland of Wall Street where a company can announce
“profits” of .80 per share in one place and special “costs and losses”
of 2 in another, and shareholders and speculators rub their hands with
glee!†</p></li>
<li><p>These amounted to a round 3 million, which was more than the
combined net profits of the preceding three years. It was now ready to
show “record earnings” in 1962, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>nor for the adverse results actually realized in the last quarter
of 1970. When the full year’s figures finally appeared, they showed only
.03 per share earned for the stock, before allowing for dilution, and
.80 per share on a diluted basis. Note also that the aggregate market
price of the stock and warrants on that date was about 4 million against
a bonded debt of 35 million—a skimpy equity position indeed.</p></li>
<li><p>This gives a special reason to select it as a harrowing example
of 1969 new financing and “hot issues.”</p></li>
<li><p>Before the best year 1968, the company’s maximum earnings had
been a ridiculous 7 cents per share. There were ambitious plans for the
future, of course—but the public was being asked to pay heavily in

<li><p>But Realty Equities had been metamorphosed into something
monstrous and vulnerable.</p></li>
<li><p>Nonetheless its equity issues sold for 25% more in the aggregate
than Air Reduction’s stock. As Table 18-2 shows, the reason can be found
both in Air Reduction’s greater profitability and in its stronger growth
record. We find here the typical consequences of a better showing of
“quality.” Air Products sold at 16½ times its latest earnings against
only 9.1 times for Air Reduction. Also Air Products sold well above its
asset backing, while Air Reduction could be bought at only 75% of its
book value.† Air Reduction paid a more liberal dividend; but this may be
deemed to reflect the greater desirability for Air Products to retain
its earnings. Also, Air Reduction had a more comfortable working-capital
position. (On this point we may remark that a profitable company can
always put its current position in shape by some form of permanent
financing. But by our standards Air Products was somewhat
overbonded.)</p></li>
<li><p>This was almost unheard of in the annals of serious stock-market
valuations. (At that time IBM was selling at about 9 times and Xerox at
11 times book value.)</p></li>
<li><p>From the standpoint of common-stock selection, neither issue
would have met our standards of sound, reasonably attractive, and
moderately priced investment. Flavors was a typical brilliantly
successful but lavishly valued company; Harvester’s showing was too
mediocre to make it really attractive even at its discount price.

class.)</p></li>

<ol start="104" type="1">
<li>We said in Chapter 8 that poor managements produce poor market
prices. The low market prices, in turn, attract the attention of
companies interested in diversifying their operations—and these are now
legion. Innumerable such acquisitions have been accomplished by
agreement with the existing managements, or else by accumulation of
shares in the market and by offers made over the head of those in
control. The price bid has usually been within the range of the value of
the enterprise under reasonably competent management. Hence, in many
cases, the inert public shareholder has been bailed out by the actions
of “outsiders”—who at times may be enterprising individuals or groups
acting on their own.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h4>
<ol start="105" type="1">
<li><p>Confronted with a like challenge to distill the secret of sound
investment into three words, we venture the motto, MARGIN OF SAFETY.
This is the thread that runs through all the preceding discussion of
investment policy—often explicitly, sometimes in a less direct fashion.
Let us try now, briefly, to trace that idea in a connected
argument.</p></li>
<li><p>That was the position of a host of strongly financed industrial
companies at the low price levels of 1932–33. In such instances the
investor can obtain the margin of safety associated with a bond, plus
all the chances of larger income and principal appreciation inherent in
a common stock. (The only thing he lacks is the legal power to insist on
dividend payments “or else”—but this is a small drawback as compared
with his advantages.) Common stocks bought under such circumstances will
supply an ideal, though infrequent, combination of safety and profit
opportunity. As a quite recent example of this condition, let us mention
once more National Presto Industries stock, which sold for a total
enterprise value of 3 million in 1972. With its 6 millions of recent
earnings before taxes the company could easily have supported this
amount of bonds.</p></li>
<li><p>But, if the picture is viewed as a whole, there is a reasonably
close connection between the growth of corporate surpluses through
reinvested earnings and the growth of corporate values.</p></li>
<li><p>Let us assume that by concentrating somewhat on the
low-multiplier issues among the large companies a defensive investor may
now acquire equities at 12 times recent earnings—i.e., with an earnings
return of 8.33% on cost. He may obtain a dividend yield of about 4%, and
he will have 4.33% of his cost reinvested in the business for his
account. On this basis, the excess of stock earning power over bond
interest over a ten-year basis would still be too small to constitute an
adequate margin of safety. For that reason we feel that there are real
risks now even in a diversified list of sound common stocks. The risks
may be fully offset by the profit possibilities of the list; and indeed
the investor may have no choice but to incur them—for otherwise he may
run an even greater risk of holding only fixed claims payable in
steadily depreciating dollars. Nonetheless the investor would do well to
recognize, and to accept as philosophically as he can, that the old
package of good profit possibilities combined with small ultimate risk
is no longer available to him.</p></li>
<li><p>The entire value of these warrants rests on the possibility that
the related stocks may some day advance above the option price. At the
moment they have no exercisable value. Yet, since all investment rests
on reasonable future expectations, it is proper to view these warrants
in terms of the mathematical chances that some future bull market will
create a large increase in their indicated value and in their price.
Such a study might well yield the conclusion that there is much more to
be gained in such an operation than to be lost and that the chances of
an ultimate profit are much better than those of an ultimate loss. If
that is so, there is a safety margin present even in this
unprepossessing security form. A sufficiently enterprising investor
could then include an option-warrant operation in his miscellany of
unconventional investments.1</p></li>
<li><p>Trade</p></li>
<li><p>The two partners Graham coyly refers to are Jerome Newman and
Benjamin Graham himself.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of a legal technicality, Graham and Newman were directed
by the U.S. Securities andandandand Exchange Commission to “spin off,”
or distribute, Graham-Newman Corp.’s GEICO stake to the fund’s
shareholders. An investor who owned 100 shares of Graham-Newman at the
beginning of 1948 (worth 1,413) and who then held on to the GEICO
distribution would have had .66 million by 1972. GEICO’s
“later-organized affiliates” included Government Employees Financial
Corp. and Criterion Insurance Co.</p></li>
<li><p>The survey Graham cites was conducted for the Fed by the
University of Michigan and was published in the Federal Reserve
Bulletin, July, 1948. People were asked, “Suppose a man decides not to
spend his money. He can either put it in a bank or in bonds or he can
invest it. What do you think would be the wisest thing for him to do
with the money nowadays—put it in the bank, buy savings bonds with it,
invest it in real estate, or buy common stock with it?” Only 4% thought
common stock would offer a “satisfactory” return; 26% considered it “not
safe” or a “gamble.” From 1949 through 1958, the stock market earned one
of its highest 10-year returns in history, averaging 18.7% annually. In
a fascinating echo of that early Fed survey, a poll conducted by
BusinessWeek at year-end 2002 found that only 24% of investors were
willing to invest more in their mutual funds or stock portfolios, down
from 47% just three years earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Speculation is beneficial on two levels: First, without
speculation, untested new companies (like Amazon.com or, in earlier
times, the Edison Electric Light Co.) would never be able to raise the
necessary capital for expansion. The alluring, long-shot chance of a
huge gain is the grease that lubricates the machinery of innovation.
Secondly, risk is exchanged (but never eliminated) every time a stock is
bought or sold. The buyer purchases the primary risk that this stock may
go down. Meanwhile, the seller still retains a residual risk—the chance
that the stock he just sold may go up!</p></li>
<li><p>Read Graham’s sentence again, and note what this greatest of
investing experts is saying: The future of security prices is never
predictable. And as you read ahead in the book, notice how everything
else Graham tells you is designed to help you grapple with that truth.
Since you cannot predict the behavior of the markets, you must learn how
to predict and control your own behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>How well did Graham’s forecast pan out? At first blush, it seems,
very well: From the beginning of 1972 through the end of 1981, stocks
earned an annual average return of 6.5%. (Graham did not specify the
time period for his forecast, but it’s plausible to assume that he was
thinking of a 10-year time horizon.) However, inflation raged at 8.6%
annually over this period, eating up the entire gain that stocks
produced. In this section of his chapter, Graham is summarizing what is
known as the “Gordon equation,” which essentially holds that the stock
market’s future return is the sum of the current dividend yield plus
expected earnings growth. With a dividend yield of just under 2% in
early 2003, and long-term earnings growth of around 2%, plus inflation
at a bit over 2%, a future average annual return of roughly 6% is
plausible. (See the commentary on Chapter 3.)</p></li>
<li><p>Since 1997, when Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or
TIPS) were introduced, stocks have no longer been the automatically
superior choice for investors who expect inflation to increase. TIPS,
unlike other bonds, rise in value if the Consumer Price Index goes up,
effectively immunizing the investor against losing money after
inflation. Stocks carry no such guarantee and, in fact, are a relatively
poor hedge against high rates of inflation. (For more details, see the
commentary to Chapter 2.)</p></li>
<li><p>Today, the most widely available alternatives to the Dow Jones
Industrial Average are the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index
(the “S andandandand P”) and the Wilshire 5000 index. The S andandandand
P focuses on 500 large, well-known companies that make up roughly 70% of
the total value of the U.S. equity market. The Wilshire 5000 follows the
returns of nearly every significant, publicly traded stock in America,
roughly 6,700 in all; but, since the largest companies account for most
of the total value of the index, the return of the Wilshire 5000 is
usually quite similar to that of the S andandandand P 500. Several
low-cost mutual funds enable investors to hold the stocks in these
indexes as a single, convenient portfolio. (See Chapter 9.)</p></li>

<li><p>For more advice on “well-established investment funds,” see
Chapter 9. “Professional administration” by “a recognized
investment-counsel firm” is discussed in Chapter 10. “Dollar-cost
averaging” is explained in Chapter 5.</p></li>
<li><p>See Chapter 8.</p></li>
<li><p>In “selling short” (or “shorting”) a stock, you make a bet that
its share price will go down, not up. Shorting is a three-step process:
First, you borrow shares from someone who owns them; then you
immediately sell the borrowed shares; finally, you replace them with
shares you buy later. If the stock drops, you will be able to buy your
replacement shares at a lower price. The difference between the price at
which you sold your borrowed shares and the price you paid for the
replacement shares is your gross profit (reduced by dividend or interest
charges, along with brokerage costs). However, if the stock goes up in
price instead of down, your potential loss is unlimited—making short
sales unacceptably speculative for most individual investors.</p></li>
<li><p>The Rothschild family, led by Nathan Mayer Rothschild, was the
dominant power in European investment banking and brokerage in the
nineteenth century. For a brilliant history, see Niall Ferguson, The
House of Rothschild: Money’s Prophets, 1798–1848 (Viking,
1998).</p></li>
<li><p>The list of sources for investment advice remains as
“miscellaneous” as it was when Graham wrote. A survey of investors
conducted in late 2002 for the Securities Industry Association, a Wall
Street trade group, found that 17% of investors depended most heavily
for investment advice on a spouse or friend; 2% on a banker; 16% on a
broker; 10% on financial periodicals; and 24% on a financial planner.
The only difference from Graham’s day is that 8% of investors now rely
heavily on the Internet and 3% on financial television. (See
www.sia.com.)</p></li>
<li><p>The character of investment counseling firms and trust banks has
not changed, but today they generally do not offer their services to
investors with less than million in financial assets; in some cases,
million or more is required. Today thousands of independent
financial-planning firms perform very similar functions, although (as
analyst Robert Veres puts it) the mutual fund has replaced blue-chip
stocks as the investment of choice and diversification has replaced
“quality” as the standard of safety.</p></li>
<li><p>Overall, Graham was as tough and cynical an observer as Wall
Street has ever seen. In this rare case, however, he was not nearly
cynical enough. Wall Street may have higher ethical standards than some
businesses (smuggling, prostitution, Congressional lobbying, and
journalism come to mind) but the investment world nevertheless has
enough liars, cheaters, and thieves to keep Satan’s check-in clerks
frantically busy for decades to come.</p></li>
<li><p>This remains true, although many of Wall Street’s best analysts
hold the title of chartered financial analyst. The CFA certification is
awarded by the Association of Investment Management andandandand
Research (formerly the Financial Analysts Federation) only after the
candidate has completed years of rigorous study and passed a series of
difficult exams. More than 50,000 analysts worldwide have been certified
as CFAs. Sadly, a recent survey by Professor Stanley Block found that
most CFAs ignore Graham’s teachings: Growth potential ranks higher than
quality of earnings, risks, and dividend policy in determining P/E
ratios, while far more analysts base their buy ratings on recent price
than on the long-term outlook for the company. See Stanley Block, “A
Study of Financial Analysts: Practice and Theory,” Financial Analysts
Journal, July/August, 1999, at www.aimrpubs.org. As Graham was fond of
saying, his own books have been read by—and ignored by—more people than
any other books in finance.</p></li>
<li><p>It is highly unusual today for a security analyst to allow mere
commoners to contact him directly. For the most part, only the nobility
of institutional investors are permitted to approach the throne of the
almighty Wall Street analyst. An individual investor might, perhaps,
have some luck calling analysts who work at “regional” brokerage firms
headquartered outside of New York City. The investor relations area at
the websites of most publicly traded companies will provide a list of
analysts who follow the stock. Websites like www.zacks.com and
www.multex.com offer access to analysts’ research reports—but the
intelligent investor should remember that most analysts do not analyze
businesses. Instead, they engage in guesswork about future stock
prices.</p></li>
<li><p>The two firms Graham had in mind were probably Du Pont, Glore,
Forgan andandandand Co. and Goodbody andandandand Co. Du Pont (founded
by the heirs to the chemical fortune) was saved from insolvency in 1970
only after Texas entrepreneur H. Ross Perot lent more than 0 million to
the firm; Goodbody, the fifth-largest brokerage firm in the United
States, would have failed in late 1970 had Merrill Lynch not acquired
it. Hayden, Stone andandandand Co. would also have gone under if it had
not been acquired. In 1970, no fewer than seven brokerage firms went
bust. The farcical story of Wall Street’s frenzied over-expansion in the
late 1960s is beautifully told in John Brooks’s The Go-Go Years (John
Wiley andandandand Sons, New York, 1999).</p></li>
<li><p>Nearly all brokerage transactions are now conducted
electronically, and securities are no longer physically “delivered.”
Thanks to the establishment of the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation, or SIPC, in 1970, investors are generally assured of
recovering their full account values if their brokerage firm becomes
insolvent. SIPC is a government-mandated consortium of brokers; all the
members agree to pool their assets to cover losses incurred by the
customers of any firm that becomes insolvent. SIPC’s protection
eliminates the need for investors to make payment and take delivery
through a bank intermediary, as Graham urges.</p></li>
<li><p>Those who heeded Graham’s advice would not have been suckered
into buying Internet IPOs in 1999 and 2000.</p></li>
<li><p>The National Federation of Financial Analysts is now the
Association for Investment Management and Research; its “quarterly”
research publication, the Financial Analysts Journal, now appears every
other month.</p></li>
<li><p>The higher the growth rate you project, and the longer the future
period over which you project it, the more sensitive your forecast
becomes to the slightest error. If, for instance, you estimate that a
company earning per share can raise that profit by 15% a year for the
next 15 years, its earnings would end up at .14. If the market values
the company at 35 times earnings, the stock would finish the period at
roughly 85. But if earnings grow at 14% instead of 15%, the company
would earn .14 at the end of the period—and, in the shock of that
shortfall, investors would no longer be willing to pay 35 times
earnings. At, say, 20 times earnings, the stock would end up around 40
per share, or more than 50% less. Because advanced mathematics gives the
appearance of precision to the inherently iffy process of foreseeing the
future, investors must be highly skeptical of anyone who claims to hold
any complex computational key to basic financial problems. As Graham put
it: “In 44 years of Wall Street experience and study, I have never seen
dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or related
investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or the most
elementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in, or higher algebra,
you could take it as a warning signal that the operator was trying to
substitute theory for experience, and usually also to give to
speculation the deceptive guise of investment.” (See p. 570.)</p></li>
<li><p>In 1972, an investor in corporate bonds had little choice but to
assemble his or her own portfolio. Today, roughly 500 mutual funds
invest in corporate bonds, creating a convenient, well-diversified
bundle of securities. Since it is not feasible to build a diversified
bond portfolio on your own unless you have at least 00,000, the typical
intelligent investor will be best off simply buying a low-cost bond fund
and leaving the painstaking labor of credit research to its managers.
For more on bond funds, see the commentary on Chapter 4.</p></li>
<li><p>By “junior stock issues” Graham means shares of common stock.
Preferred stock is considered “senior” to common stock because the
company must pay all dividends on the preferred before paying any
dividends on the common.</p></li>
<li><p>After investors lost billions of dollars on the shares of
recklessly assembled utility companies in 1929–1932, Congress authorized
the SEC to regulate the issuance of utility stocks under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.</p></li>
<li><p>In more recent years, most mutual funds have almost robotically
mimicked the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index, lest any
different holdings cause their returns to deviate from that of the
index. In a countertrend, some fund companies have launched what they
call “focused” portfolios, which own 25 to 50 stocks that the managers
declare to be their “best ideas.” That leaves investors wondering
whether the other funds run by the same managers contain their worst
ideas. Considering that most of the “best idea” funds do not markedly
outperform the averages, investors are also entitled to wonder whether
the managers’ ideas are even worth having in the first place. For
indisputably skilled investors like Warren Buffett, wide diversification
would be foolish, since it would water down the concentrated force of a
few great ideas. But for the typical fund manager or individual
investor, not diversifying is foolish, since it is so difficult to
select a limited number of stocks that will include most winners and
exclude most losers. As you own more stocks, the damage any single loser
can cause will decline, and the odds of owning all the big winners will
rise. The ideal choice for most investors is a total stock market index
fund, a low-cost way to hold every stock worth owning.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham’s point about chemical and oil companies in the 1960s
applies to nearly every industry in nearly every time period. Wall
Street’s consensus view of the future for any given sector is usually
either too optimistic or too pessimistic. Worse, the consensus is at its
most cheery just when the stocks are most overpriced—and gloomiest just
when they are cheapest. The most recent example, of course, is
technology and telecommunications stocks, which hit record highs when
their future seemed brightest in 1999 and early 2000, and then crashed
all the way through 2002. History proves that Wall Street’s “expert”
forecasters are equally inept at predicting the performance of 1) the
market as a whole, 2) industry sectors, and 3) specific stocks. As
Graham points out, the odds that individual investors can do any better
are not good. The intelligent investor excels by making decisions that
are not dependent on the accuracy of anybody’s forecasts, including his
or her own. (See Chapter 8.)</p></li>
<li><p>This figure, now known as the “dividend payout ratio,” has
dropped considerably since Graham’s day as American tax law discouraged
investors from seeking, and corporations from paying, dividends. As of
year-end 2002, the payout ratio stood at 34.1% for the S andandandand P
500-stock index and, as recently as April 2000, it hit an all-time low
of just 25.3%. (See www.barra.com/ research/fundamentals.asp.) We
discuss dividend policy more thoroughly in the commentary on Chapter
19.</p></li>
<li><p>Why is this? By “the rule of 72,” at 10% interest a given amount
of money doubles in just over seven years, while at 7% it doubles in
just over 10 years. When interest rates are high, the amount of money
you need to set aside today to reach a given value in the future is
lower—since those high interest rates will enable it to grow at a more
rapid rate. Thus a rise in interest rates today makes a future stream of
earnings or dividends less valuable—since the alternative of investing
in bonds has become relatively more attractive.</p></li>
<li><p>These industry groups, ideally, would not be overly dependent on
such unforeseeable factors as fluctuating interest rates or the future
direction of prices for raw materials like oil or metals. Possibilities
might be industries like gaming, cosmetics, alcoholic beverages, nursing
homes, or waste management.</p></li>
<li><p>“Dilution” is one of many words that describe stocks in the
language of fluid dynamics. A stock with high trading volume is said to
be “liquid.” When a company goes public in an IPO, it “floats” its
shares. And, in earlier days, a company that drastically diluted its
shares (with large amounts of convertible debt or multiple offerings of
common stock) was said to have “watered” its stock. This term is
believed to have originated with the legendary market manipulator Daniel
Drew (1797–1879), who began as a livestock trader. He would drive his
cattle south toward Manhattan, force-feeding them salt along the way.
When they got to the Harlem River, they would guzzle huge volumes of
water to slake their thirst. Drew would then bring them to market, where
the water they had just drunk would increase their weight. That enabled
him to get a much higher price, since cattle on the hoof is sold by the
pound. Drew later watered the stock of the Erie Railroad by massively
issuing new shares without warning.</p></li>
<li><p>The king probably took his inspiration from a once-famous essay
by the English writer William Hazlitt, who mused about a sundial near
Venice that bore the words Horas non numero nisi serenas, or “I count
only the hours that are serene.” Companies that chronically exclude bad
news from their financial results on the pretext that negative events
are “extraordinary” or “nonrecurring” are taking a page from Hazlitt,
who urged his readers “to take no note of time but by its benefits, to
watch only for the smiles and neglect the frowns of fate, to compose our
lives of bright and gentle moments, turning away to the sunny side of
things, and letting the rest slip from our imaginations, unheeded or
forgotten!” (William Hazlitt, “On a Sun-Dial,” ca.1827.) Unfortunately,
investors must always count the sunny and dark hours alike.</p></li>
<li><p>The company to which Graham refers so coyly appears to be
American Machine andandandand Foundry (or AMF Corp.), one of the most
jumbled conglomerates of the late 1960s. It was a predecessor of today’s
AMF Bowling Worldwide, which operates bowling alleys and manufactures
bowling equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>Nowadays, investors need to be aware of several other “accounting
factors” that can distort reported earnings. One is “pro forma” or “as
if” financial statements, which report a company’s earnings as if
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) did not apply. Another
is the dilutive effect of issuing millions of stock options for
executive compensation, then buying back millions of shares to keep
those options from reducing the value of the common stock. A third is
unrealistic assumptions of return on the company’s pension funds, which
can artificially inflate earnings in good years and depress them in bad.
Another is “Special Purpose Entities,” oraffiliated firms or
partnerships that buy risky assets or liabilities of the company and
thus “remove” those financial risks from the company’s balance sheet.
Another element of distortion is the treatment of marketing or other
“soft” costs as assets of the company, rather than as normal expenses of
doing business. We will briefly examine such practices in the commentary
that accompanies this chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Northwest Industries was the holding company for, among other
businesses, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Co. and Union Underwear
(the maker of both BVD and Fruit of the Loom briefs). It was taken over
in 1985 by overindebted financier William Farley, who ran the company
into the ground. Fruit of the Loom was bought in a bankruptcy proceeding
by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in early 2002.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is referring to the provision of Federal tax law that
allows corporations to “carry forward” their net operating losses. As
the tax code now stands, these losses can be carried forward for up to
20 years, reducing the company’s tax liability for the entire period
(and thus raising its earnings after tax). Therefore, investors should
consider whether recent severe losses could actually improve the
company’s net earnings in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>“Mean figure” refers to the simple, or arithmetic, average that
Graham describes in the preceding sentence.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham appears to be using “earnings on capital funds” in the
traditional sense of return on book value—essentially, net income
divided by the company’s tangible net assets.</p></li>
<li><p>See pp. 299–301.</p></li>
<li><p>Of Graham’s four examples, only Emerson Electric still exists in
the same form. ELTRA Corp. is no longer an independent company; it
merged with Bunker Ramo Corp. in the 1970s, putting it in the business
of supplying stock quotes to brokerage firms across an early network of
computers. What remains of ELTRA’s operations is now part of Honeywell
Corp. The firm formerly known as Emery Air Freight is now a division of
CNF Inc. Emhart Corp. was acquired by Black andandandand Decker Corp. in
1989.</p></li>
<li><p>This measure is captured in the line “Net per share/book value”
in Table 13-2, which measures the companies’ net income as a percentage
of their tangible book value.</p></li>
<li><p>In each case, Graham is referring to Section C of Table 13-2 and
dividing the high price during the 1936–1968 period by the low price.
For example, Emery’s high price of 66 divided by its low price of 1/8
equals 528, or a ratio of 528 to 1 between the high and low.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of 1970, Emerson’s .6 billion in market value truly
was “enormous,” given average stock sizes at the time. At year-end 2002,
Emerson’s common stock had a total market value of approximately 1
billion.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham was right. Of the “Nifty Fifty” stocks that were most
fashionable and highly valued in 1972, Emery fared among the worst. The
March 1, 1982, issue of Forbes reported that since 1972 Emery had lost
72.8% of its value after inflation. By late 1974, according to the
investment researchers at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, Emery’s
stock had already fallen 58% and its price/earnings ratio had plummeted
from 64 times to just 15. The “overenthusiasm” Graham had warned against
was eviscerated in short order. Can the passage of time make up for this
kind of excess? Not always: Leuthold calculated that 000 invested in
Emery in 1972 would be worth only 39 as of 1999. It’s likely that the
people who overpaid for Internet stocks in the late 1990s will not break
even for decades—if ever (see the commentary on Chapter 20).</p></li>
<li><p>Graham’s point is that, based on their prices at the time, an
investor could buy shares in these two companies for little more than
their book value, as shown in the third line of Section B in Table
13-2.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham describes his recommended investment policies in Chapters
4 through 7.</p></li>
<li><p>In early 2003, the yield on 10-year, AA-rated corporate bonds was
around 4.6%, suggesting—by Graham’s formula—that a stock portfolio
should have an earnings-to-price ratio at least that high. Taking the
inverse of that number (by dividing 4.6 into 100), we can derive a
“suggested maximum” P/E ratio of 21.7. At the beginning of this
paragraph Graham recommends that the “average” stock be priced about 20%
below the “maximum” ratio. That suggests that—in general—Graham would
consider stocks selling at no more than 17 times their three-year
average earnings to be potentially attractive given today’s interest
rates and market conditions. As of December 31, 2002, more than 200—or
better than 40%—of the stocks in the S andandandand P 500-stock index
had three-year average P/E ratios of 17.0 or lower. Updated AA bond
yields can be found at www.bondtalk.com.</p></li>
<li><p>An easy-to-use online stock screener that can sort the stocks in
the S andandandand P 500 by most of Graham’s criteria is available at:
www.quicken.com/ investments/stocks/search/full.</p></li>
<li><p>In a remarkable confirmation of Graham’s point, the dull-sounding
Standard andandandand Poor’s Utility Index outperformed the vaunted
NASDAQ Composite Index for the 30 years ending December 31,
2002.</p></li>
<li><p>Today the financial-services industry is made up of even more
components, including commercial banks; savings andandandand loan and
mortgage-financing companies; consumer-finance firms like credit-card
issuers; money managers and trust companies; investment banks and
brokerages; insurance companies; and firms engaged in developing or
owning real estate, including real-estate investment trusts. Although
the sector is much more diversified today, Graham’s caveats about
financial soundness apply more than ever.</p></li>
<li><p>Only a few major rail stocks now remain, including Burlington
Northern, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Union Pacific. The advice in this
section is at least as relevant to airline stocks today—with their
massive current losses and a half-century of almost incessantly poor
results—as it was to railroads in Graham’s day.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is summarizing the “efficient markets hypothesis,” or EMH,
an academic theory claiming that the price of each stock incorporates
all publicly available information about the company. With millions of
investors scouring the market every day, it is unlikely that severe
mispricings can persist for long. An old joke has two finance professors
walking along the sidewalk; when one spots a 0 bill and bends over to
pick it up, the other grabs his arm and says, “Don’t bother. If it was
really a 0 bill, someone would have taken it already.” While the market
is not perfectly efficient, it is pretty close most of the time—so the
intelligent investor will stoop to pick up the stock market’s 0 bills
only after researching them thoroughly and minimizing the costs of
trading and taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>This is one of the central points of Graham’s book. All investors
labor under a cruel irony: We invest in the present, but we invest for
the future. And, unfortunately, the future is almost entirely uncertain.
Inflation and interest rates are undependable; economic recessions come
and go at random; geopolitical upheavals like war, commodity shortages,
and terrorism arrive without warning; and the fate of individual
companies and their industries often turns out to be the opposite of
what most investors expect. Therefore, investing on the basis of
projection is a fool’s errand; even the forecasts of the so-called
experts are less reliable than the flip of a coin. For most people,
investing on the basis of protection—from overpaying for a stock and
from overconfidence in the quality of their own judgment—is the best
solution. Graham expands on this concept in Chapter 20.</p></li>
<li><p>The Friend-Blume-Crockett research covered January 1960, through
June 1968, and compared the performance of more than 100 major mutual
funds against the returns on portfolios constructed randomly from more
than 500 of the largest stocks listed on the NYSE. The funds in the
Friend-Blume-Crockett study did better from 1965 to 1968 than they had
in the first half of the measurement period, much as Graham found in his
own research (see above, pp. 158 and 229–232). But that improvement did
not last. And the thrust of these studies—that mutual funds, on average,
underperform the market by a margin roughly equal to their operating
expenses and trading costs—has been reconfirmed so many times that
anyone who doubts them should found a financial chapter of The Flat
Earth Society.</p></li>
<li><p>As we discuss in the commentary on Chapter 9, there are several
other reasons mutual funds have not been able to outperform the market
averages, including the low returns on the funds’ cash balances and the
high costs of researching and trading stocks. Also, a fund holding 120
companies (a typical number) can trail the S andandandand P 500-stock
index if any of the other 380 companies in that benchmark turns out to
be a great performer. The fewer stocks a fund owns, the more likely it
is to miss “the next Microsoft.”</p></li>
<li><p>In this section, as he did also on pp. 363–364, Graham is
summarizing the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Recent appearances to the
contrary, the problem with the stock market today is not that so many
financial analysts are idiots, but rather that so many of them are so
smart. As more and more smart people search the market for bargains,
that very act of searching makes those bargains rarer—and, in a cruel
paradox, makes the analysts look as if they lack the intelligence to
justify the search. The market’s valuation of a given stock is the
result of a vast, continuous, real-time operation of collective
intelligence. Most of the time, for most stocks, that collective
intelligence gets the valuation approximately right. Only rarely does
Graham’s “Mr. Market” (see Chapter 8) send prices wildly out of
whack.</p></li>
<li><p>An “unrelated” hedge involves buying a stock or bond issued by
one company and short-selling (or betting on a decline in) a security
issued by a different company. A “related” hedge involves buying and
selling different stocks or bonds issued by the same company. The “new
group” of hedge funds described by Graham were widely available around
1968, but later regulation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission restricted access to hedge funds for the general
public.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2003, an intelligent investor following Graham’s train of
thought would be searching for opportunities in the technology,
telecommunications, and electric-utility industries. History has shown
that yesterday’s losers are often tomorrow’s winners.</p></li>
<li><p>The successor corporation to Industrial National Bank of Rhode
Island is FleetBoston Financial Corp. One of its corporate ancestors,
the Providence Bank, was founded in 1791.</p></li>
<li><p>For today’s investor, the cutoff is more likely to be around per
share—the level below which many stocks are “delisted,” or declared
ineligible for trading on major exchanges. Just monitoring the stock
prices of these companies can take a considerable amount of effort,
making them impractical for defensive investors. The costs of trading
low-priced stocks can be very high. Finally, companies with very low
stock prices have a distressing tendency to go out of business. However,
a diversified portfolio of dozens of these distressed companies may
still appeal to some enterprising investors today.</p></li>
<li><p>In Graham’s terms, a large amount of goodwill can result from two
causes: a corporation can acquire other companies for substantially more
than the value of their assets, or its own stock can trade for
substantially more than its book value.</p></li>
<li><p>Technically, the working-capital value of a stock is the current
assets per share, minus the current liabilities per share, divided by
the number of shares outstanding. Here, however, Graham means “net
working-capital value,” or the per-share value of current assets minus
total liabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connaît point. This
poetic passage is one of the concluding arguments in the great French
theologian’s discussion of what has come to be known as “Pascal’s wager”
(see commentary on Chapter 20).</p></li>
<li><p>As discussed in the commentary on Chapter 7, merger arbitrage is
wholly inappropriate for most individual investors.</p></li>
<li><p>How “shocked” was the financial world by the Penn Central’s
bankruptcy, which was filed over the weekend of June 20–21, 1970? The
closing trade in Penn Central’s stock on Friday, June 19, was 1.25 per
share—hardly a going-out-of-business price. In more recent times, stocks
like Enron and WorldCom have also sold at relatively high prices shortly
before filing for bankruptcy protection.</p></li>
<li><p>Penn Central was the product of the merger, announced in 1966, of
the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad.</p></li>
<li><p>A railroad’s “transportation ratio” (now more commonly called its
operating ratio) measures the expenses of running its trains divided by
the railroad’s total revenues. The higher the ratio, the less efficient
the railroad. Today even a ratio of 70% would be considered
excellent.</p></li>
<li><p>The sordid tradition of hiding a company’s true earnings picture
under the cloak of restructuring charges is still with us. Piling up
every possible charge in one year is sometimes called “big bath” or
“kitchen sink” accounting. This bookkeeping gimmick enables companies to
make an easy show of apparent growth in the following year—but investors
should not mistake that for real business health.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham would have been disappointed, though surely not surprised,
to see that commercial banks have chronically kept supporting “unsound
expansions.” Enron and WorldCom, two of the biggest collapses in
corporate history, were aided and abetted by billions of dollars in bank
loans.</p></li>
<li><p>In June 1972 (just after Graham finished this chapter), a Federal
judge found that NVF’s chairman, Victor Posner, had improperly diverted
the pension assets of Sharon Steel “to assist affiliated companies in
their takeovers of other corporations.” In 1977, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission secured a permanent injunction against Posner, NVF,
and Sharon Steel to prevent them from future violations of Federal laws
against securities fraud. The Commission alleged that Posner and his
family had improperly obtained .7 million in personal perks from NVF and
Sharon, overstated Sharon’s pretax earnings by 3.9 million, misrecorded
inventory, and “shifted income and expenses from one year to another.”
Sharon Steel, which Graham had singled out with his cold and skeptical
eye, became known among Wall Street wags as “Share and Steal.” Posner
was later a central force in the wave of leveraged buyouts and hostile
takeovers that swept the United States in the 1980s, as he became a
major customer for the junk bonds underwritten by Drexel Burnham
Lambert.</p></li>
<li><p>The “large dilution factor” would be triggered when NVF employees
exercised their warrants to buy common stock. The company would then
have to issue more shares, and its net earnings would be divided across
a much greater number of shares outstanding.</p></li>
<li><p>In “Abou Ben Adhem,” by the British Romantic poet Leigh Hunt
(1784–1859), a righteous Muslim sees an angel writing in a golden book
“the names of those who love the Lord.” When the angel tells Abou that
his name is not among them, Abou says, “I pray thee, then, write me as
one that loves his fellow men.” The angel returns the next night to show
Abou the book, in which now “Ben Adhem’s name led all the
rest.”</p></li>
<li><p>By purchasing more common stock at a premium to its book value,
the investing public increased the value of AAA’s equity per share. But
investors were only pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, since
most of the rise in shareholders’ equity came from the public’s own
willingness to over-pay for the stock.</p></li>
<li><p>The first four sentences of Graham’s paragraph could read as the
official epitaph of the Internet and telecommunications bubble that
burst in early 2000. Just as the Surgeon General’s warning on the side
of a cigarette pack does not stop everyone from lighting up, no
regulatory reform will ever prevent investors from overdosing on their
own greed. (Not even Communism can outlaw market bubbles; the Chinese
stock market shot up 101.7% in the first half of 1999, then crashed.)
Nor can investment banks ever be entirely cleansed of their own
compulsion to sell any stock at any price the market will bear. The
circle can only be broken one investor, and one financial adviser, at a
time. Mastering Graham’s principles (see especially Chapters 1, 8, and
20) is the best way to start.</p></li>
<li><p>Here Graham is describing Real Estate Investment Trust, which was
acquired by San Francisco Real Estate Investors in 1983 for 0 a share.
The next paragraph describes Realty Equities Corp. of New York.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham, an avid reader of poetry, is quoting Thomas Gray’s “Elegy
Written in a Country Churchyard.”</p></li>
<li><p>Realty Equities was delisted from the American Stock Exchange in
September 1973. In 1974, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
sued Realty Equities’ accountants for fraud. Realty Equities’ founder,
Morris Karp, later pleaded guilty to one count of grand larceny. In
1974–1975, the overindebtedness that Graham criticizes led to a
financial crisis among large banks, including Chase Manhattan, that had
lent heavily to the most aggressive realty trusts.</p></li>
<li><p>By “volume,” Graham is referring to sales or revenues—the total
dollar amount of each company’s business.</p></li>
<li><p>Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., still exists as a
publicly-traded stock and is included in the Standard andandandand
Poor’s 500-stock index. Air Reduction Co. became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The BOC Group (then known as British Oxygen) in
1978.</p></li>
<li><p>American Home Products Co. is now known as Wyeth; the stock is
included in the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index. American
Hospital Supply Co. was acquired by Baxter Healthcare Corp. in
1985.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nearly 30 times” is reflected in the entry of 2920% under
“Price/book value” in the Ratios section of Table 18-4. Graham would
have shaken his head in astonishment during late 1999 and early 2000,
when many high-tech companies sold for hundreds of times their asset
value (see the commentary on this chapter). Talk about “almost unheard
of in the annals of serious stock-market valuations”! H andandandand R
Block remains a publicly-traded company, while Blue Bell was taken
private in 1984 at 7.50 per share.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is alerting readers to a form of the “gambler’s fallacy,”
in which investors believe that an overvalued stock must drop in price
purely because it is overvalued. Just as a coin does not become more
likely to turn up heads after landing on tails for nine times in a row,
so an overvalued stock (or stock market!) can stay overvalued for a
surprisingly long time. That makes short-selling, or betting that stocks
will drop, too risky for mere mortals.</p></li>
<li><p>For more of Graham’s thoughts on shareholder activism, see the
commentary on Chapter 19. In criticizing Harvester for its refusal to
maximize shareholder value, Graham uncannily anticipated the behavior of
the company’s future management. In 2001, a majority of shareholders
voted to remove Navistar’s restrictions against outside takeover
bids—but the board of directors simply refused to implement the
shareholders’ wishes. It’s remarkable that an antidemocratic tendency in
the culture of some companies can endure for decades.</p></li>
<li><p>McGraw-Hill remains a publicly-traded company that owns, among
other operations, BusinessWeek magazine and Standard andandandand Poor’s
Corp. McGraw–Edison is now a division of Cooper Industries.</p></li>
<li><p>In “the May 1970 debacle” that Graham refers to, the U.S. stock
market lost 5.5%. From the end of March to the end of June 1970, the S
andandandand P 500 index lost 19% of its value, one of the worst
three-month returns on record.</p></li>
<li><p>National Presto remains a publicly-traded company. National
General was acquired in 1974 by another controversial conglomerate,
American Financial Group, which at various times has had interests in
cable television, banking, real estate, mutual funds, insurance, and
bananas. AFG is also the final resting place of some of the assets of
Penn Central Corp. (see Chapter 17).</p></li>
<li><p>Whiting Corp. ended up a subsidiary of Wheelabrator-Frye, but was
taken private in 1983. Willcox andandandand Gibbs is now owned by Group
Rexel, an electrical-equipment manufacturer that is a division of
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute Group of France. Rexel’s shares trade on the
Paris Stock Exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>Ironically, takeovers began drying up shortly after Graham’s last
revised edition appeared, and the 1970s and early 1980s marked the
absolute low point of modern American industrial efficiency. Cars were
“lemons,” televisions and radios were constantly “on the fritz,” and the
managers of many publicly-traded companies ignored both the present
interests of their outside shareholders and the future prospects of
their own businesses. All of this began to change in 1984, when
independent oilman T. Boone Pickens launched a hostile takeover bid for
Gulf Oil. Soon, fueled by junk-bond financing provided by Drexel Burnham
Lambert, “corporate raiders” stalked the landscape of corporate America,
scaring long-sclerotic companies into a new regimen of efficiency. While
many of the companies involved in buy-outs and takeovers were ravaged,
the rest of American business emerged both leaner (which was good) and
meaner (which sometimes was not).</p></li>
<li><p>The irony that Graham describes here grew even stronger in the
1990s, when it almost seemed that the stronger the company was, the less
likely it was to pay a dividend—or for its shareholders to want one. The
“payout ratio” (or the percentage of their net income that companies
paid out as dividends) dropped from “60% to 75%” in Graham’s day to 35%
to 40% by the end of the 1990s.</p></li>
<li><p>In the late 1990s, technology companies were particularly strong
advocates of the view that all of their earnings should be “plowed back
into the business,” where they could earn higher returns than any
outside shareholder possibly could by reinvesting the same cash if it
were paid out to him or her in dividends. Incredibly, investors never
questioned the truth of this patronizing Daddy-Knows-Best principle—or
even realized that a company’s cash belongs to the shareholders, not its
managers. See the commentary on this chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Superior Oil’s stock price peaked at 165 per share in 1959, when
it paid a dividend. For many years, Superior was the highest-priced
stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Superior, controlled by the
Keck family of Houston, was acquired by Mobil Corp. in 1984.</p></li>
<li><p>Today, virtually all stock splits are carried out by a change in
value. In a two-for-one split, one share becomes two, each trading at
half the former price of the original single share; in a three-for-one
split, one share becomes three, each trading at a third of the former
price; and so on. Only in very rare cases is a sum transferred “from
earned surplus to capital account,” as in Graham’s day.</p></li>
<li><p>This policy, already unusual in Graham’s day, is extremely rare
today. In 1936 and again in 1950, roughly half of all stocks on the NYSE
paid a so-called special dividend. By 1970, however, that percentage had
declined to less than 10% and, by the 1990s, was well under 5%. See
Harry DeAngelo, Linda DeAngelo, and Douglas J. Skinner, “Special
Dividends and the Evolution of Dividend Signaling,” Journal of Financial
Economics, vol. 57, no. 3, September, 2000, pp. 309–354. The most
plausible explanation for this decline is that corporate managers became
uncomfortable with the idea that shareholders might interpret special
dividends as a signal that future profits might be low.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham’s argument is no longer valid, and today’s investors can
safely skip over this passage. Shareholders no longer need to worry
about “having to break up” a stock certificate, since virtually all
shares now exist in electronic rather than paper form. And when Graham
says that a 5% increase in a cash dividend on 100 shares is less
“probable” than a constant dividend on 105 shares, it’s unclear how he
could even calculate that probability.</p></li>
<li><p>The administration of President George W. Bush made progress in
early 2003 toward reducing the problem of double-taxation of corporate
dividends, although it is too soon to know how helpful any final laws in
this area will turn out to be. A cleaner approach would be to make
dividend payments tax-deductible to the corporation, but that is not
part of the proposed legislation.</p></li>
<li><p>By the late 1990s, this advice—which can be appropriate for a
foundation or endowment with an infinitely long investment horizon—had
spread to individual investors, whose life spans are finite. In the 1994
edition of his influential book, Stocks for the Long Run, finance
professor Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton School recommended that
“risk-taking” investors should buy on margin, borrowing more than a
third of their net worth to sink 135% of their assets into stocks. Even
government officials got in on the act: In February 1999, the Honorable
Richard Dixon, state treasurer of Maryland, told the audience at an
investment conference: “It doesn’t make any sense for anyone to have any
money in a bond fund.”</p></li>
<li><p>This is one of Graham’s rare misjudgments. In 1973, just two
years after President Richard Nixon imposed wage and price controls,
inflation hit 8.7%, its highest level since the end of World War II. The
decade from 1973 through 1982 was the most inflationary in modern
American history, as the cost of living more than doubled.</p></li>
<li><p>See p. 25.</p></li>
<li><p>John Pierpont Morgan was the most powerful financier of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Because of his vast influence,
he was constantly asked what the stock market would do next. Morgan
developed a mercifully short and unfailingly accurate answer: “It will
fluctuate.” See Jean Strouse, Morgan: American Financier (Random House,
1999), p. 11.</p></li>
<li><p>The investment philosopher Peter L. Bernstein feels that Graham
was “dead wrong” about precious metals, particularly gold, which (at
least in the years after Graham wrote this chapter) has shown a robust
ability to out-pace inflation. Financial adviser William Bernstein
agrees, pointing out that a tiny allocation to a precious-metals fund
(say, 2% of your total assets) is too small to hurt your overall returns
when gold does poorly. But, when gold does well, its returns are often
so spectacular—sometimes exceeding 100% in a year—that it can, all by
itself, set an otherwise lackluster portfolio glittering. However, the
intelligent investor avoids investing in gold directly, with its high
storage and insurance costs; instead, seek out a well-diversified mutual
fund specializing in the stocks of precious-metal companies and charging
below 1% in annual expenses. Limit your stake to 2% of your total
financial assets (or perhaps 5% if you are over the age of 65).</p></li>
<li><p>“It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to
invent him a sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and
appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: ‘
And this, too, shall pass away.’ How much it expresses! How chastening
in the hour of pride!—how consoling in the depths of affliction! ‘And
this, too, shall pass away.’ And yet let us hope it is not quite
true.”—Abraham Lincoln, Address to the Wisconsin State Agricultural
Society, Milwaukee, September 30, 1859, in Abraham Lincoln: Speeches and
Writings, 1859–1865 (Library of America,1985), vol. II, p. 101.</p></li>
<li><p>“Earning power” is Graham’s term for a company’s potential
profits or, as he puts it, the amount that a firm “might be expected to
earn year after year if the business conditions prevailing during the
period were to continue unchanged” (Security Analysis, 1934 ed.,
p. 354). Some of his lectures make it clear that Graham intended the
term to cover periods of five years or more. You can crudely but
conveniently approximate a company’s earning power per share by taking
the inverse of its price/earnings ratio; a stock with a P/E ratio of 11
can be said to have earning power of 9% (or 1 divided by 11). Today
“earning power” is often called “earnings yield.”</p></li>
<li><p>This problem is discussed extensively in the commentary on
Chapter 19.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham elegantly summarized the discussion that follows in a
lecture he gave in 1972: “The margin of safety is the difference between
the percentage rate of the earnings on the stock at the price you pay
for it and the rate of interest on bonds, and that margin of safety is
the difference which would absorb unsatisfactory developments. At the
time the 1965 edition of The Intelligent Investor was written the
typical stock was selling at 11 times earnings, giving about 9% return
as against 4% on bonds. In that case you had a margin of safety of over
100 per cent. Now 〔in 1972〕 there is no difference between the
earnings rate on stocks and the interest rate on stocks, and I say there
is no margin of safety…you have a negative margin of safety on stocks…”
See “Benjamin Graham: Thoughts on Security Analysis” 〔transcript of
lecture at the Northeast Missouri State University business school,
March, 1972〕, Financial History, no. 42, March, 1991, p. 9.</p></li>
<li><p>This paragraph—which Graham wrote in early 1972—is an uncannily
precise description of market conditions in early 2003. (For more
detail, see the commentary on Chapter 3.)</p></li>
<li><p>In “American” roulette, most wheels include 0 and 00 along with
numbers 1 through 36, for a total of 38 slots. The casino offers a
maximum payout of 35 to 1. What if you bet on every number? Since only
one slot can be the one into which the ball drops, you would win 5 on
that slot, but lose on each of your other 37 slots, for a net loss of .
That difference (or a 5.26% spread on your total 8 bet) is the casino’s
“house advantage,” ensuring that, on average, roulette players will
always lose more than they win. Just as it is in the roulette player’s
interest to bet as seldom as possible, it is in the casino’s interest to
keep the roulette wheel spinning. Likewise, the intelligent investor
should seek to maximize the number of holdings that offer “a better
chance for profit than for loss.” For most investors, diversification is
the simplest and cheapest way to widen your margin of safety.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is saying that there is no such thing as a good or bad
stock; there are only cheap stocks and expensive stocks. Even the best
company becomes a “sell” when its stock price goes too high, while the
worst company is worth buying if its stock goes low enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham uses “common-stock option warrant” as a synonym for
“warrant,” a security issued directly by a corporation giving the holder
a right to purchase the company’s stock at a predetermined price.
Warrants have been almost entirely superseded by stock options. Graham
quips that he intends the example as a “shocker” because, even in his
day, warrants were regarded as one of the market’s seediest backwaters.
(See the commentary on Chapter 16.)</p></li>
<li><p>The study, in its final form, was Lawrence Fisher and James H.
Lorie, “Rates of Return on Investments in Common Stock: the Year-by-Year
Record, 1926–65,” The Journal of Business, vol. XLI, no. 3 (July, 1968),
pp. 291–316. For a summary of the study’s wide influence, see http://
library.dfaus.com/reprints/work_of_art/.</p></li>
<li><p>See pp. 50–52.</p></li>
<li><p>See Graham’s “Conclusion” to Chapter 2, p. 56–57.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham’s objection to high-yield bonds is mitigated today by the
widespread availability of mutual funds that spread the risk and do the
research of owning “junk bonds.” See the commentary on Chapter 6 for
more detail.</p></li>
<li><p>A bond’s “coupon” is its interest rate; a “low-coupon” bond pays
a rate of interest income below the market average.</p></li>
<li><p>While Graham’s logic remains valid, the numbers have changed.
Corporations can currently deduct 70% of the income they receive from
dividends, and the standard corporate tax rate is 35%. Thus, a
corporation would pay roughly 4.50 in tax on 00 in dividends from
preferred stock versus 5 in tax on 00 in interest income. Individuals
pay the same rate of income tax on dividend income that they do on
interest income, so preferred stock offers them no tax
advantage.</p></li>
<li><p>At the beginning of 1949, the average annual return produced by
stocks over the previous 20 years was 3.1%, versus 3.9% for long-term
Treasury bonds—meaning that 0,000 invested in stocks would have grown to
8,415 over that period, while the same amount in bonds would have turned
into 1,494. Naturally enough, 1949 turned out to be a fabulous time to
buy stocks: Over the next decade, the Standard andandandand Poor’s
500-stock index gained an average of 20.1% per year, one of the best
long-term returns in the history of the U.S. stock market.</p></li>
<li><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a then-record high of
381.17 on September 3, 1929. It did not close above that level until
November 23, 1954—more than a quarter of a century later—when it hit
382.74. (When you say you intend to own stocks “for the long run,” do
you realize just how long the long run can be—or that many investors who
bought in 1929 were no longer even alive by 1954?) However, for patient
investors who reinvested their income, stock returns were positive over
this otherwise dismal period, simply because dividend yields averaged
more than 5.6% per year. According to professors Elroy Dimson, Paul
Marsh, and Mike Staunton of London Business School, if you had invested
in U.S. stocks in 1900 and spent all your dividends, your stock
portfolio would have grown to 98 by 2000. But if you had reinvested all
your dividends, your stock portfolio would have been worth 6,797! Far
from being an afterthought, dividends are the greatest force in stock
investing.</p></li>
<li><p>See pp. 56–57 and 88–89.</p></li>
<li><p>Today’s defensive investor should probably insist on at least 10
years of continuous dividend payments (which would eliminate from
consideration only one member of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average—Microsoft—and would still leave at least 317 stocks to choose
from among the S andandandand P 500 index). Even insisting on 20 years
of uninterrupted dividend payments would not be overly restrictive;
according to Morgan Stanley, 255 companies in the S andandandand P 500
met that standard as of year-end 2002.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham makes this point on p. 73.</p></li>
<li><p>“Earnings multiplier” is a synonym for P/E or price/earnings
ratios, which measure how much investors are willing to pay for a stock
compared to the profitability of the underlying business. (See footnote
† on p. 70 in Chapter 3.)</p></li>
<li><p>To update Graham’s figures, take each dollar amount in this
section and multiply it by five.</p></li>
<li><p>In today’s markets, to be considered large, a company should have
a total stock value (or “market capitalization”) of at least 0 billion.
According to the online stock screener at
http://screen.yahoo.com/stocks.html, that gave you roughly 300 stocks to
choose from as of early 2003.</p></li>
<li><p>Here Graham has made a slip of the tongue. After insisting in
Chapter 1 that the definition of an “enterprising” investor depends not
on the amount of risk you seek, but the amount of work you are willing
to put in, Graham falls back on the conventional notion that
enterprising investors are more “aggressive.” The rest of the chapter,
however, makes clear that Graham stands by his original definition. (The
great British economist John Maynard Keynes appears to have been the
first to use the term “enterprise” as a synonym for analytical
investment.)</p></li>
<li><p>“High-coupon issues” are corporate bonds paying above-average
interest rates (in today’s markets, at least 8%) or preferred stocks
paying large dividend yields (10% or more). If a company must pay high
rates of interest in order to borrow money, that is a fundamental signal
that it is risky. For more on high-yield or “junk” bonds, see
pp. 145–147.</p></li>
<li><p>For a recent example that painfully reinforces Graham’s point,
see p. 146 below.</p></li>
<li><p>Bond prices are quoted in percentages of “par value,” or 100. A
bond priced at “85” is selling at 85% of its principal value; a bond
originally offered for 0,000, but now selling at 85, will cost ,500.
When bonds sell below 100, they are called “discount” bonds; above 100,
they become “premium” bonds.</p></li>
<li><p>New issues of common stock—initial public offerings or
IPOs—normally are sold with an “underwriting discount” (a built-in
commission) of 7%. By contrast, the buyer’s commission on older shares
of common stock typically ranges below 4%. Whenever Wall Street makes
roughly twice as much for selling something new as it does for selling
something old, the new will get the harder sell.</p></li>
<li><p>In the two years from June 1960, through May 1962, more than 850
companies sold their stock to the public for the first time—an average
of more than one per day. In late 1967 the IPO market heated up again;
in 1969 an astonishing 781 new stocks were born. That oversupply helped
create the bear markets of 1969 and 1973–1974. In 1974 the IPO market
was so dead that only nine new stocks were created all year; 1975 saw
only 14 stocks born. That undersupply, in turn, helped feed the bull
market of the 1980s, whenroughly 4,000 new stocks flooded the
market—helping to trigger the over-enthusiasm that led to the 1987
crash. Then the cycle swung the other way again as IPOs dried up in
1988–1990. That shortage contributed to the bull market of the
1990s—and, right on cue, Wall Street got back into the business of
creating new stocks, cranking out nearly 5,000 IPOs. Then, after the
bubble burst in 2000, only 88 IPOs were issued in 2001—the lowest annual
total since 1979. In every case, the public has gotten burned on IPOs,
has stayed away for at least two years, but has always returned for
another scalding. For as long as stock markets have existed, investors
have gone through this manic-depressive cycle. In America’s first great
IPO boom, back in 1825, a man was said to have been squeezed to death in
the stampede of speculators trying to buy shares in the new Bank of
Southwark; the wealthiest buyers hired thugs to punch their way to the
front of the line. Sure enough, by 1829, stocks had lost roughly 25% of
their value.</p></li>
<li><p>Here Graham is describing rights offerings, in which investors
who already own a stock are asked to pony up even more money to maintain
the same proportional interest in the company. This form of financing,
still widespread in Europe, has become rare in the United States, except
among closed-end funds.</p></li>
<li><p>In Graham’s day, the most prestigious investment banks generally
steeredclear of the IPO business, which was regarded as an undignified
exploitation of naïve investors. By the peak of the IPO boom in late
1999 and early 2000, however, Wall Street’s biggest investment banks had
jumped in with both feet. Venerable firms cast off their traditional
prudence and behaved like drunken mud wrestlers, scrambling to foist
ludicrously overvalued stocks on a desperately eager public. Graham’s
description of how the IPO process works is a classic that should be
required reading in investment-banking ethics classes, if there are
any.</p></li>
<li><p>As already noted (see p. 96, footnote †), the New Housing
Authority and New Community bonds are no longer issued.</p></li>
<li><p>Note very carefully what Graham is saying here. Writing in 1972,
he contends that the period since 1949—a stretch of more than 22
years—is too short a period from which to draw reliable conclusions!
With his mastery of mathematics, Graham never forgets that objective
conclusions require very long samples of large amounts of data. The
charlatans who peddle “time-tested” stock-picking gimmicks almost always
base their findings on smaller samples than Graham would ever accept.
(Graham often used 50-year periods to analyze past data.)</p></li>
<li><p>Over the 10 years ending December 31, 2002, funds investing in
large growth companies—today’s equivalent of what Graham calls “growth
funds”—earned an annual average of 5.6%, underperforming the overall
stock market by an average of 3.7 percentage points per year. However,
“large value” funds investing in more reasonably priced big companies
also underperformed the market over the same period (by a full
percentage point per year). Is the problem merely that growth funds
cannot reliably select stocks that will outperform the market in the
future? Or is it that the high costs of running the average fund
(whether it buys growth or “value” companies) exceed any extra return
the managers can earn with their stock picks? To update fund performance
by type, see www.morningstar.com, “Category Returns.” For an
enlightening reminder of how perishable the performance of different
investment styles can be, see www.callan.com/resource/periodic_
table/pertable.pdf.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham makes this point to remind you that an “enterprising”
investor is not one who takes more risk than average or who buys
“aggressive growth” stocks; an enterprising investor is simply one who
is willing to put in extra time and effort in researching his or her
portfolio.</p></li>
<li><p>Recent examples hammer Graham’s point home. On September 21,
2000, Intel Corp., the maker of computer chips, announced that it
expected its revenues to grow by up to 5% in the next quarter. At first
blush, that sounds great; most big companies would be delighted to
increase their sales by 5% in just three months. But in response,
Intel’s stock dropped 22%, a one-day loss of nearly 1 billion in total
value. Why? Wall Street’s analysts had expected Intel’s revenue to rise
by up to 10%. Similarly, on February 21, 2001, EMC Corp., a data-storage
firm, announced that it expected its revenues to grow by at least 25% in
2001—but that a new caution among customers “may lead to longer selling
cycles.” On that whiff of hesitation, EMC’s shares lost 12.8% of their
value in a single day.</p></li>
<li><p>Today’s equivalent of investors “who have a close relationship
with the particular company” are so-called control persons—senior
managers or directors who help run the company and own huge blocks of
stock. Executives like Bill Gates of Microsoft or Warren Buffett of
Berkshire Hathaway have direct control over a company’s destiny—and
outside investors want to see these chief executives maintain their
large shareholdings as a vote of confidence. But less-senior managers
and rank-and-file workers cannot influence the company’s share price
with their individual decisions; thus they should not put more than a
small percentage of their assets in their own employer’s stock. As for
outside investors, no matter how well they think they know the company,
the same objection applies.</p></li>
<li><p>Drexel Firestone, a Philadelphia investment bank, merged in 1973
with Burnham andandandand Co. and later became Drexel Burnham Lambert,
famous for its junk-bond financing of the 1980s takeover boom.</p></li>
<li><p>Among the steepest of the mountains recently made out of
molehills: In May 1998, Pfizer Inc. and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration announced that six men taking Pfizer’s anti-impotence
drug Viagra had died of heart attacks while having sex. Pfizer’s stock
immediately went flaccid, losing 3.4% in a single day on heavy trading.
But Pfizer’s shares surged ahead when research later showed that there
was no cause for alarm; the stock gained roughly a third over the next
two years. In late 1997, shares of Warner-Lambert Co. fell by 19% in a
day when sales of its new diabetes drug were temporarily halted in
England; within six months, the stock had nearly doubled. In late 2002,
Carnival Corp., which operates cruise ships, lost roughly 10% of its
value after tourists came down with severe diarrhea and vomiting—on
ships run by other companies.</p></li>
<li><p>By “net working capital,” Graham means a company’s current assets
(such as cash, marketable securities, and inventories) minus its total
liabilities (including preferred stock and long-term debt).</p></li>
<li><p>From 1975 through 1983, small (“secondary”) stocks outperformed
large stocks by an amazing average of 17.6 percentage points per year.
The investing public eagerly embraced small stocks, mutual fund
companies rolled out hundreds of new funds specializing in them, and
small stocks obliged by underperforming large stocks by five percentage
points per year over the next decade. The cycle recurred in 1999, when
small stocks beat big stocks by nearly nine percentage points, inspiring
investment bankers to sell hundreds of hot little high-tech stocks to
the public for the first time. Instead of “electronics,” “computers,” or
“franchise” in their names, the new buzzwords were “.com,” “optical,”
“wireless,” and even prefixes like “e-” and “I-.” Investing buzzwords
always turn into buzz saws, tearing apart anyone who believes in
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Defaulted railroad bonds do not offer significant opportunities
today. However, as already noted, distressed and defaulted junk bonds,
as well as convertible bonds issued by high-tech companies, may offer
real value in the wake of the 2000–2002 market crash. But
diversification in this area is essential—and impractical without at
least 00,000 to dedicate to distressed securities alone. Unless you are
a millionaire several times over, this kind of diversification is not an
option.</p></li>
<li><p>A classic recent example is Philip Morris, whose stock lost 23%
in two days after a Florida court authorized jurors to consider punitive
damages of up to 00 billion against the company—which had finally
admitted that cigarettes may cause cancer. Within a year, Philip
Morris’s stock had doubled—only to fall back after a later
multibillion-dollar judgment in Illinois. Several other stocks have been
virtually destroyed by liability lawsuits, including Johns Manville, W.
R. Grace, and USG Corp. Thus, “never buy into a lawsuit” remains a valid
rule for all but the most intrepid investors to live by.</p></li>
<li><p>See p. 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Without bear markets to take stock prices back down, anyone
waiting to “buy low” will feel completely left behind—and, all too
often, will end up abandoning any former caution and jumping in with
both feet. That’s why Graham’s message about the importance of emotional
discipline is so important. From October 1990 through January 2000, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average marched relentlessly upward, never losing
more than 20% and suffering a loss of 10% or more only three times. The
total gain (not counting dividends): 395.7%. According to Crandall,
Pierce andandandand Co., this was the second-longest uninterrupted bull
market of the past century; only the 1949–1961 boom lasted longer. The
longer a bull market lasts, the more severely investors will be
afflicted with amnesia; after five years or so, many people no longer
believe that bear markets are even possible. All those who forget are
doomed to be reminded; and, in the stock market, recovered memories are
always unpleasant.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham discusses this “recommended policy” in Chapter 4
(pp. 89–91). This policy, now called “tactical asset allocation,” is
widely followed by institutional investors like pension funds and
university endowments.</p></li>
<li><p>Many of these “formula planners” would have sold all their stocks
at the end of 1954, after the U.S. stock market rose 52.6%, the
second-highest yearly return then on record. Over the next five years,
these market-timers would likely have stood on the sidelines as stocks
doubled.</p></li>
<li><p>Today’s equivalent of what Graham calls “second-line companies”
would be any of the thousands of stocks not included in the Standard
andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index. A regularly revised list of the 500
stocks in the S andandandand P index is available at
www.standardandpoors.com.</p></li>
<li><p>For today’s investor, the ideal strategy for pursuing this
“formula” is rebalancing, which we discuss on pp. 104–105.</p></li>
<li><p>Most companies today provide “an engraved stock certificate” only
upon special request. Stocks exist, for the most part, in purely
electronic form (much as your bank account contains computerized credits
and debits, not actual currency) and thus have become even easier to
trade than they were in Graham’s day.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham’s use of the word “paradox” is probably an allusion to a
classic article by David Durand, “Growth Stocks and the Petersburg
Paradox,” The Journal of Finance, vol. XII, no. 3, September, 1957,
pp. 348–363, which compares investing in high-priced growth stocks to
betting on a series of coin flips in which the payoff escalates with
each flip of the coin. Durand points out that if a growth stock could
continue to grow at a high rate for an indefinite period of time, an
investor should (in theory) be willing to pay an infinite price for its
shares. Why, then, has no stock ever sold for a price of infinity
dollars per share? Because the higher the assumed future growth rate,
and the longer the time period over which it is expected, the wider the
margin for error grows, and the higher the cost of even a tiny
miscalculation becomes. Graham discusses this problem further in
Appendix 4(p. 570).</p></li>
<li><p>The more recent history of A andandandand P is no different. At
year-end 1999, its share price was 7.875; at year-end 2000, .00; a year
later, 3.78; at year-end 2002, .06. Although some accounting
irregularities later came to light at A andandandand P, it defies all
logic to believe that the value of a relatively stable business like
groceries could fall by three-fourths in one year, triple the next year,
then drop by two-thirds the year after that.</p></li>
<li><p>“Only to the extent that it suits his book” means “only to the
extent that the price is favorable enough to justify selling the stock.”
In traditional brokerage lingo, the “book” is an investor’s ledger of
holdings and trades.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham has much more to say on what is now known as “corporate
governance.” See the commentary on Chapter 19.</p></li>
<li><p>By what Graham called “the rule of opposites,” in 2002 the yields
on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds hit their lowest levels since 1963.
Since bond yields move inversely to prices, those low yields meant that
prices had risen—making investors most eager to buy just as bonds were
at their most expensive and as their future returns were almost
guaranteed to be low. This provides another proof of Graham’s lesson
that the intelligent investor must refuse to make decisions based on
market fluctuations.</p></li>
<li><p>An updated analysis for today’s readers, explaining recent yields
and the wider variety of bonds and bond funds available today, can be
found in the commentary on Chapter 4.</p></li>
<li><p>As mentioned in the commentary on Chapters 2 and 4, Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are a new and improved version
of what Graham is suggesting here.</p></li>
<li><p>It is a violation of Federal law for an open-end mutual fund, a
closed-end fund, or an exchange-traded fund to sell shares to the public
unless it has “registered” (or made mandatory financial filings) with
the SEC.</p></li>
<li><p>Lists of the major types of mutual funds can be found at
www.ici.org/ pdf/g2understanding.pdf and
http://news.morningstar.com/fundReturns/ CategoryReturns.html.
Letter-stock funds no longer exist, while hedge funds are generally
banned by SEC rules from selling shares to any investor whose annual
income is below 00,000 or whose net worth is below million.</p></li>
<li><p>Dual-purpose funds, popular in the late 1980s, have essentially
disappeared from the marketplace—a shame, since they offered investors a
more flexible way to take advantage of the skills of great stock pickers
like John Neff. Perhaps the recent bear market will lead to a
renaissance of this attractive investment vehicle.</p></li>
<li><p>For periods as long as 10 years, the returns of the Dow and the S
andandandand P 500 can diverge by fairly wide margins. Over the course
of the typical investing lifetime, however—say 25 to 50 years—their
returns have tended to converge quite closely.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the “doomed companies” Graham refers to was National
Student Marketing Corp., a con game masquerading as a stock, whose saga
was told brilliantly in Andrew Tobias’s The Funny Money Game (Playboy
Press, New York, 1971). Among the supposedly sophisticated investors who
were snookered by NSM’s charismatic founder, Cort Randell, were the
endowment funds of Cornell and Harvard and the trust departments at such
prestigious banks as Morgan Guaranty and Bankers Trust.</p></li>
<li><p>As only the latest proof that “the more things change, the more
they stay the same,” consider that Ryan Jacob, a 29-year-old boy wonder,
launched the Jacob Internet Fund at year-end 1999, after producing a
216% return at his previous dot-com fund. Investors poured nearly 00
million into Jacob’s fund in the first few weeks of 2000. It then
proceeded to lose 79.1% in 2000, 56.4% in 2001, and 13% in 2002—a
cumulative collapse of 92%. That loss may have made Mr. Jacob’s
investors even older and wiser than it made him.</p></li>
<li><p>Today’s equivalent of Graham’s “scarce exceptions” tend to be
open-end funds that are closed to new investors—meaning that the
managers have stopped taking in any more cash. While that reduces the
management fees they can earn, it maximizes the returns their existing
shareholders can earn. Because most fund managers would rather look out
for No. 1 than be No. 1, closing a fund to new investors is a rare and
courageous step.</p></li>
<li><p>Raskob (1879–1950) was a director of Du Pont, the giant chemical
company, and chairman of the finance committee at General Motors. He
also served as national chairman of the Democratic Party and was the
driving force behind the construction of the Empire State Building.
Calculations by finance professor Jeremy Siegel confirm that Raskob’s
plan would have grown to just under ,000 after 20 years, although
inflation would have eaten away much of that gain. For the best recent
look at Raskob’s views on long-term stock investing, see the essay by
financial adviser William Bernstein at
www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/197/raskob.htm.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham’s “brief discussion” is in two parts, on p. 33 and
pp. 191–192. For more detail on the Dow Theory, see
http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/ dow/dowpage.html.</p></li>
<li><p>The Penn Central Transportation Co., then the biggest railroad in
the United States, sought bankruptcy protection on June 21,
1970—shocking investors, who had never expected such a giant company to
go under (see. 423). Among the companies with “excessive” debt Graham
had in mind were Ling-Temco-Vought and National General Corp. (see
pp. 425 and 463). The “problem of solvency” on Wall Street emerged
between 1968 and 1971, when several prestigious brokerages suddenly went
bust.</p></li>
<li><p>See Chapter 2. As of the beginning of 2003, U.S. Treasury bonds
maturing in 10 years yielded 3.8%, while stocks (as measured by the Dow
Jones Industrial Average) yielded 1.9%. (Note that this relationship is
not all that different from the 1964 figures that Graham cites.) The
income generated by top-quality bonds has been falling steadily since
1981.</p></li>
<li><p>“Air-transport stocks,” of course, generated as much excitement
in the late 1940s and early 1950s as Internet stocks did a half century
later. Among the hottest mutual funds of that era were Aeronautical
Securities and the Missiles-Rockets-Jets andandandand Automation Fund.
They, like the stocks they owned, turned out to be an investing
disaster. It is commonly accepted today that the cumulative earnings of
the airline industry over its entire history have been negative. The
lesson Graham is driving at is not that you should avoid buying airline
stocks, but that you should never succumb to the “certainty” that any
industry will outperform all others in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Tangible assets include a company’s physical property (like real
estate, factories, equipment, and inventories) as well as its financial
balances (such as cash, short-term investments, and accounts
receivable). Among the elements not included in tangible assets are
brands, copyrights, patents, franchises, goodwill, and trademarks. To
see how to calculate tangible-asset value, see footnote † on
p. 198.</p></li>
