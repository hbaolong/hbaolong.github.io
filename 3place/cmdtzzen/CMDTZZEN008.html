<h4 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h4>
<p>Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side</p>
<p>The enterprising investor, by definition, will devote a fair amount
of his attention and efforts toward obtaining a better than
run-of-the-mill investment result. In our discussion of general
investment policy we have made some suggestions regarding bond
investments that are addressed chiefly to the enterprising investor. He
might be interested in special opportunities of the following kinds:</p>
<p>Tax-free New Housing Authority bonds effectively guaranteed by the
United States government.</p>
<p>Taxable but high-yielding New Community bonds, also guaranteed by the
United States government.</p>
<p>Tax-free industrial bonds issued by municipalities, but serviced by
lease payments made by strong corporations.</p>
<p>References have been made to these unusual types of bond issues in
Chapter 4.*</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum there may be lower-quality bonds
obtainable at such low prices as to constitute true bargain
opportunities. But these would belong in the “special situation” area,
where no true distinction exists between bonds and common stocks.†</p>
<p>Operations in Common Stocks</p>
<p>The activities specially characteristic of the enterprising investor
in the common-stock field may be classified under four heads:</p>
<p>Buying in low markets and selling in high markets</p>
<p>Buying carefully chosen “growth stocks”</p>
<p>Buying bargain issues of various types</p>
<p>Buying into “special situations”</p>
<p>General Market Policy—Formula Timing</p>
<p>We reserve for the next chapter our discussion of the possibilities
and limitations of a policy of entering the market when it is depressed
and selling out in the advanced stages of a boom. For many years in the
past this bright idea appeared both simple and feasible, at least from
first inspection of a market chart covering its periodic fluctuations.
We have already admitted ruefully that the market’s action in the past
20 years has not lent itself to operations of this sort on any
mathematical basis. The fluctuations that have taken place, while not
inconsiderable in extent, would have required a special talent or “feel”
for trading to take advantage of them. This is something quite different
from the intelligence which we are assuming in our readers, and we must
exclude operations based on such skill from our terms of reference.</p>
<p>The 50–50 plan, which we proposed to the defensive investor and
described on p. 90, is about the best specific or automatic formula we
can recommend to all investors under the conditions of 1972. But we have
retained a broad leeway between the 25% minimum and the 75% maximum in
common stocks, which we allow to those investors who have strong
convictions about either the danger or the attractiveness of the general
market level. Some 20 years ago it was possible to discuss in great
detail a number of clear-cut formulas for varying the percentage held in
common stocks, with confidence that these plans had practical utility.1
The times seem to have passed such approaches by, and there would be
little point in trying to determine new levels for buying and selling
out of the market patterns since 1949. That is too short a period to
furnish any reliable guide to the future.*</p>
<p>Growth-Stock Approach</p>
<p>Every investor would like to select the stocks of companies that will
do better than the average over a period of years. A growth stock may be
defined as one that has done this in the past and is expected to do so
in the future.2 Thus it seems only logical that the intelligent investor
should concentrate upon the selection of growth stocks. Actually the
matter is more complicated, as we shall try to show.</p>
<p>It is a mere statistical chore to identify companies that have
“out-performed the averages” in the past. The investor can obtain a list
of 50 or 100 such enterprises from his broker.† Why, then, should he not
merely pick out the 15 or 20 most likely looking issues of this group
and lo! he has a guaranteed-successful stock portfolio?</p>
<p>There are two catches to this simple idea. The first is that common
stocks with good records and apparently good prospects sell at
correspondingly high prices. The investor may be right in his judgment
of their prospects and still not fare particularly well, merely because
he has paid in full (and perhaps overpaid) for the expected prosperity.
The second is that his judgment as to the future may prove wrong.
Unusually rapid growth cannot keep up forever; when a company has
already registered a brilliant expansion, its very increase in size
makes a repetition of its achievement more difficult. At some point the
growth curve flattens out, and in many cases it turns downward.</p>
<p>It is obvious that if one confines himself to a few chosen instances,
based on hindsight, he could demonstrate that fortunes can readily be
either made or lost in the growth-stock field. How can one judge fairly
of the overall results obtainable here? We think that reasonably sound
conclusions can be drawn from a study of the results achieved by the
investment funds specializing in the growth-stock approach. The
authoritative manual entitled Investment Companies, published annually
by Arthur Wiesenberger andandandand Company, members of the New York
Stock Exchange, computes the annual performance of some 120 such “growth
funds” over a period of years. Of these, 45 have records covering ten
years or more. The average overall gain for these companies—unweighted
for size of fund—works out at 108% for the decade 1961–1970, compared
with 105% for the S andandandand P composite and 83% for the DJIA.3 In
the two years 1969 and 1970 the majority of the 126 “growth funds” did
worse than either index. Similar results were found in our earlier
studies. The implication here is that no outstanding rewards came from
diversified investment in growth companies as compared with that in
common stocks generally.*</p>
<p>There is no reason at all for thinking that the average intelligent
investor, even with much devoted effort, can derive better results over
the years from the purchase of growth stocks than the investment
companies specializing in this area. Surely these organizations have
more brains and better research facilities at their disposal than you
do. Consequently we should advise against the usual type of growth-stock
commitment for the enterprising investor.* This is one in which the
excellent prospects are fully recognized in the market and already
reflected in a current price-earnings ratio of, say, higher than 20.
(For the defensive investor we suggested an upper limit of purchase
price at 25 times average earnings of the past seven years. The two
criteria would be about equivalent in most cases.)†</p>
<p>The striking thing about growth stocks as a class is their tendency
toward wide swings in market price. This is true of the largest and
longest-established companies—such as General Electric and International
Business Machines—and even more so of newer and smaller successful
companies. They illustrate our thesis that the main characteristic of
the stock market since 1949 has been the injection of a highly
speculative element into the shares of companies which have scored the
most brilliant successes, and which themselves would be entitled to a
high investment rating. (Their credit standing is of the best, and they
pay the lowest interest rates on their borrowings.) The investment
caliber of such a company may not change over a long span of years, but
the risk characteristics of its stock will depend on what happens to it
in the stock market. The more enthusiastic the public grows about it,
and the faster its advance as compared with the actual growth in its
earnings, the riskier a proposition it becomes.*</p>
<p>But is it not true, the reader may ask, that the really big fortunes
from common stocks have been garnered by those who made a substantial
commitment in the early years of a company in whose future they had
great confidence, and who held their original shares unwaveringly while
they increased 100-fold or more in value? The answer is “Yes.” But the
big fortunes from single-company investments are almost always realized
by persons who have a close relationship with the particular
company—through employment, family connection, etc.—which justifies them
in placing a large part of their resources in one medium and holding on
to this commitment through all vicissitudes, despite numerous
temptations to sell out at apparently high prices along the way. An
investor without such close personal contact will constantly be faced
with the question of whether too large a portion of his funds are in
this one medium.* Each decline—however temporary it proves in the
sequel—will accentuate his problem; and internal and external pressures
are likely to force him to take what seems to be a goodly profit, but
one far less than the ultimate bonanza.4</p>
<p>Three Recommended Fields for “Enterprising Investment”</p>
<p>To obtain better than average investment results over a long pull
requires a policy of selection or operation possessing a twofold merit:
(1) It must meet objective or rational tests of underlying soundness;
and (2) it must be different from the policy followed by most investors
or speculators. Our experience and study leads us to recommend three
investment approaches that meet these criteria. They differ rather
widely from one another, and each may require a different type of
knowledge and temperament on the part of those who assay it.</p>
<p>The Relatively Unpopular Large Company</p>
<p>If we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue common
stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are glamorous for
some other reason, it is logical to expect that it will
undervalue—relatively, at least—companies that are out of favor because
of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature. This may be set
down as a fundamental law of the stock market, and it suggests an
investment approach that should prove both conservative and
promising.</p>
<p>The key requirement here is that the enterprising investor
concentrate on the larger companies that are going through a period of
unpopularity. While small companies may also be undervalued for similar
reasons, and in many cases may later increase their earnings and share
price, they entail the risk of a definitive loss of profitability and
also of protracted neglect by the market in spite of better earnings.
The large companies thus have a double advantage over the others. First,
they have the resources in capital and brain power to carry them through
adversity and back to a satisfactory earnings base. Second, the market
is likely to respond with reasonable speed to any improvement shown.</p>
<p>A remarkable demonstration of the soundness of this thesis is found
in studies of the price behavior of the unpopular issues in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average. In these it was assumed that an investment was
made each year in either the six or the ten issues in the DJIA which
were selling at the lowest multipliers of their current or previous
year’s earnings. These could be called the “cheapest” stocks in the
list, and their cheapness was evidently the reflection of relative
unpopularity with investors or traders. It was assumed further that
these purchases were sold out at the end of holding periods ranging from
one to five years. The results of these investments were then compared
with the results shown in either the DJIA as a whole or in the highest
multiplier (i.e., the most popular) group.</p>
<p>The detailed material we have available covers the results of annual
purchases assumed in each of the past 53 years.5 In the early period,
1917–1933, this approach proved unprofitable. But since 1933 the method
has shown highly successful results. In 34 tests made by Drexel
andandandand Company (now Drexel Firestone)* of one-year holding—from
1937 through 1969—the cheap stocks did definitely worse than the DJIA in
only three instances; the results were about the same in six cases; and
the cheap stocks clearly outperformed the average in 25 years. The
consistently better performance of the low-multiplier stocks is shown
(Table 7-2) by the average results for successive five-year periods,
when compared with those of the DJIA and of the ten
high-multipliers.</p>
<p>TABLE 7-2 Average Annual Percentage Gain or Loss on Test Issues,
1937–1969</p>
<p>The Drexel computation shows further that an original investment of
0,000 made in the low-multiplier issues in 1936, and switched each year
in accordance with the principle, would have grown to 6,900 by 1962. The
same operations in high-multiplier stocks would have ended with a value
of only 5,300; while an operation in all thirty stocks would have
increased the original fund to 4,000.†</p>
<p>The concept of buying “unpopular large companies” and its execution
on a group basis, as described above, are both quite simple. But in
considering individual companies a special factor of opposite import
must sometimes to be taken into account. Companies that are inherently
speculative because of widely varying earnings tend to sell both at a
relatively high price and at a relatively low multiplier in their good
years, and conversely at low prices and high multipliers in their bad
years. These relationships are illustrated in Table 7-3, covering
fluctuations of Chrysler Corp. common. In these cases the market has
sufficient skepticism as to the continuation of the unusually high
profits to value them conservatively, and conversely when earnings are
low or nonexistent. (Note that, by the arithmetic, if a company earns
“next to nothing” its shares must sell at a high multiplier of these
minuscule profits.)</p>
<p>As it happens Chrysler has been quite exceptional in the DJIA list of
leading companies, and hence it did not greatly affect the the
low-multiplier calculations. It would be quite easy to avoid inclusion
of such anomalous issues in a low-multiplier list by requiring also that
the price be low in relation to past average earnings or by some similar
test.</p>
<p>While writing this revision we tested the results of the
DJIA-low-multiplier method applied to a group assumed to be bought at
the end of 1968 and revalued on June 30, 1971. This time the figures
proved quite disappointing, showing a sharp loss for the low-multiplier
six or ten and a good profit for the high-multiplier selections. This
one bad instance should not vitiate conclusions based on 30-odd
experiments, but its recent happening gives it a special adverse weight.
Perhaps the aggressive investor should start with the “low-multiplier”
idea, but add other quantitative and qualitative requirements thereto in
making up his portfolio.</p>
<p>TABLE 7-3 Chrysler Common Prices and Earnings, 1952–1970</p>
<p>Purchase of Bargain Issues</p>
<p>We define a bargain issue as one which, on the basis of facts
established by analysis, appears to be worth considerably more than it
is selling for. The genus includes bonds and preferred stocks selling
well under par, as well as common stocks. To be as concrete as possible,
let us suggest that an issue is not a true “bargain” unless the
indicated value is at least 50% more than the price. What kind of facts
would warrant the conclusion that so great a discrepancy exists? How do
bargains come into existence, and how does the investor profit from
them?</p>
<p>There are two tests by which a bargain common stock is detected. The
first is by the method of appraisal. This relies largely on estimating
future earnings and then multiplying these by a factor appropriate to
the particular issue. If the resultant value is sufficiently above the
market price—and if the investor has confidence in the technique
employed—he can tag the stock as a bargain. The second test is the value
of the business to a private owner. This value also is often determined
chiefly by expected future earnings—in which case the result may be
identical with the first. But in the second test more attention is
likely to be paid to the realizable value of the assets, with particular
emphasis on the net current assets or working capital.</p>
<p>At low points in the general market a large proportion of common
stocks are bargain issues, as measured by these standards. (A typical
example was General Motors when it sold at less than 30 in 1941,
equivalent to only 5 for the 1971 shares. It had been earning in excess
of and paying .50, or more, in dividends.) It is true that current
earnings and the immediate prospects may both be poor, but a levelheaded
appraisal of average future conditions would indicate values far above
ruling prices. Thus the wisdom of having courage in depressed markets is
vindicated not only by the voice of experience but also by application
of plausible techniques of value analysis.</p>
<p>The same vagaries of the market place that recurrently establish a
bargain condition in the general list account for the existence of many
individual bargains at almost all market levels. The market is fond of
making mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordinary vicissitudes
into major setbacks.* Even a mere lack of interest or enthusiasm may
impel a price decline to absurdly low levels. Thus we have what appear
to be two major sources of undervaluation: (1) currently disappointing
results and (2) protracted neglect or unpopularity.</p>
<p>However, neither of these causes, if considered by itself alone, can
be relied on as a guide to successful common-stock investment. How can
we be sure that the currently disappointing results are indeed going to
be only temporary? True, we can supply excellent examples of that
happening. The steel stocks used to be famous for their cyclical
quality, and the shrewd buyer could acquire them at low prices when
earnings were low and sell them out in boom years at a fine profit. A
spectacular example is supplied by Chrysler Corporation, as shown by the
data in Table 7-3.</p>
<p>If this were the standard behavior of stocks with fluctuating
earnings, then making profits in the stock market would be an easy
matter. Unfortunately, we could cite many examples of declines in
earnings and price which were not followed automatically by a handsome
recovery of both. One such was Anaconda Wire and Cable, which had large
earnings up to 1956, with a high price of 85 in that year. The earnings
then declined irregularly for six years; the price fell to 23½ in 1962,
and the following year it was taken over by its parent enterprise
(Anaconda Corporation) at the equivalent of only 33.</p>
<p>The many experiences of this type suggest that the investor would
need more than a mere falling off in both earnings and price to give him
a sound basis for purchase. He should require an indication of at least
reasonable stability of earnings over the past decade or more—i.e., no
year of earnings deficit—plus sufficient size and financial strength to
meet possible setbacks in the future. The ideal combination here is thus
that of a large and prominent company selling both well below its past
average price and its past average price/earnings multiplier. This would
no doubt have ruled out most of the profitable opportunities in
companies such as Chrysler, since their low-price years are generally
accompanied by high price/earnings ratios. But let us assure the reader
now—and no doubt we shall do it again—that there is a world of
difference between “hindsight profits” and “real-money profits.” We
doubt seriously whether the Chrysler type of roller coaster is a
suitable medium for operations by our enterprising investor.</p>
<p>We have mentioned protracted neglect or unpopularity as a second
cause of price declines to unduly low levels. A current case of this
kind would appear to be National Presto Industries. In the bull market
of 1968 it sold at a high of 45, which was only 8 times the .61 earnings
for that year. The per-share profits increased in both 1969 and 1970,
but the price declined to only 21 in 1970. This was less than 4 times
the (record) earnings in that year and less than its net-current-asset
value. In March 1972 it was selling at 34, still only 5½ times the last
reported earnings, and at about its enlarged net-current-asset
value.</p>
<p>Another example of this type is provided currently by Standard Oil of
California, a concern of major importance. In early 1972 it was selling
at about the same price as 13 years before, say 56. Its earnings had
been remarkably steady, with relatively small growth but with only one
small decline over the entire period. Its book value was about equal to
the market price. With this conservatively favorable 1958–71 record the
company has never shown an average annual price as high as 15 times its
current earnings. In early 1972 the price/earnings ratio was only about
10.</p>
<p>A third cause for an unduly low price for a common stock may be the
market’s failure to recognize its true earnings picture. Our classic
example here is Northern Pacific Railway which in 1946–47 declined from
36 to 13½. The true earnings of the road in 1947 were close to 0 per
share. The price of the stock was held down in great part by its
dividend. It was neglected also because much of its earnings power was
concealed by accounting methods peculiar to railroads.</p>
<p>The type of bargain issue that can be most readily identified is a
common stock that sells for less than the company’s net working capital
alone, after deducting all prior obligations.* This would mean that the
buyer would pay nothing at all for the fixed assets—buildings,
machinery, etc., or any good-will items that might exist. Very few
companies turn out to have an ultimate value less than the working
capital alone, although scattered instances may be found. The surprising
thing, rather, is that there have been so many enterprises obtainable
which have been valued in the market on this bargain basis. A
compilation made in 1957, when the market’s level was by no means low,
disclosed about 150 of such common stocks. In Table 7-4 we summarize the
result of buying, on December 31, 1957, one share of each of the 85
companies in that list for which data appeared in Standard andandandand
Poor’s Monthly Stock Guide, and holding them for two years.</p>
<p>By something of a coincidence, each of the groups advanced in the two
years to somewhere in the neighborhood of the aggregate
net-current-asset value. The gain for the entire “portfolio” in that
period was 75%, against 50% for Standard andandandand Poor’s 425
industrials. What is more remarkable is that none of the issues showed
significant losses, seven held about even, and 78 showed appreciable
gains.</p>
<p>Our experience with this type of investment selection—on a
diversified basis—was uniformly good for many years prior to 1957. It
can probably be affirmed without hesitation that it constitutes a safe
and profitable method of determining and taking advantage of undervalued
situations. However, during the general market advance after 1957 the
number of such opportunities became extremely limited, and many of those
available were showing small operating profits or even losses. The
market decline of 1969–70 produced a new crop of these
“sub-working-capital” stocks. We discuss this group in Chapter 15, on
stock selection for the enterprising investor.</p>
<p>TABLE 7-4 Profit Experience of Undervalued Stocks, 1957–1959</p>
<p>BARGAIN-ISSUE PATTERN IN SECONDARY COMPANIES. We have defined a
secondary company as one that is not a leader in a fairly important
industry. Thus it is usually one of the smaller concerns in its field,
but it may equally well be the chief unit in an unimportant line. By way
of exception, any company that has established itself as a growth stock
is not ordinarily considered “secondary.”</p>
<p>In the great bull market of the 1920s relatively little distinction
was drawn between industry leaders and other listed issues, provided the
latter were of respectable size. The public felt that a middle-sized
company was strong enough to weather storms and that it had a better
chance for really spectacular expansion than one that was already of
major dimensions. The depression years 1931–32, however, had a
particularly devastating impact on the companies below the first rank
either in size or in inherent stability. As a result of that experience
investors have since developed a pronounced preference for industry
leaders and a corresponding lack of interest most of the time in the
ordinary company of secondary importance. This has meant that the latter
group have usually sold at much lower prices in relation to earnings and
assets than have the former. It has meant further that in many instances
the price has fallen so low as to establish the issue in the bargain
class.</p>
<p>When investors rejected the stocks of secondary companies, even
though these sold at relatively low prices, they were expressing a
belief or fear that such companies faced a dismal future. In fact, at
least subconsciously, they calculated that any price was too high for
them because they were heading for extinction—just as in 1929 the
companion theory for the “blue chips” was that no price was too high for
them because their future possibilities were limitless. Both of these
views were exaggerations and were productive of serious investment
errors. Actually, the typical middle-sized listed company is a large one
when compared with the average privately owned business. There is no
sound reason why such companies should not continue indefinitely in
operation, undergoing the vicissitudes characteristic of our economy but
earning on the whole a fair return on their invested capital.</p>
<p>This brief review indicates that the stock market’s attitude toward
secondary companies tends to be unrealistic and consequently to create
in normal times innumerable instances of major undervaluation. As it
happens, the World War II period and the postwar boom were more
beneficial to the smaller concerns than to the larger ones, because then
the normal competition for sales was suspended and the former could
expand sales and profit margins more spectacularly. Thus by 1946 the
market’s pattern had completely reversed itself from that before the
war. Whereas the leading stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
advanced only 40% from the end of 1938 to the 1946 high, Standard
andandandand Poor’s index of low-priced stocks had shot up no less than
280% in the same period. Speculators and many self-styled investors—with
the proverbial short memories of people in the stock market—were eager
to buy both old and new issues of unimportant companies at inflated
levels. Thus the pendulum had swung clear to the opposite extreme. The
very class of secondary issues that had formerly supplied by far the
largest proportion of bargain opportunities was now presenting the
greatest number of examples of overenthusiasm and overvaluation. In a
different way this phenomenon was repeated in 1961 and 1968—the emphasis
now being placed on new offerings of the shares of small companies of
less than secondary character, and on nearly all companies in certain
favored fields such as “electronics,” “computers,” “franchise” concerns,
and others.*</p>
<p>As was to be expected the ensuing market declines fell most heavily
on these overvaluations. In some cases the pendulum swing may have gone
as far as definite under valuation.</p>
<p>If most secondary issues tend normally to be undervalued, what reason
has the investor to believe that he can profit from such a situation?
For if it persists indefinitely, will he not always be in the same
market position as when he bought the issue? The answer here is somewhat
complicated. Substantial profits from the purchase of secondary
companies at bargain prices arise in a variety of ways. First, the
dividend return is relatively high. Second, the reinvested earnings are
substantial in relation to the price paid and will ultimately affect the
price. In a five-to seven-year period these advantages can bulk quite
large in a well-selected list. Third, a bull market is ordinarily most
generous to low-priced issues; thus it tends to raise the typical
bargain issue to at least a reasonable level. Fourth, even during
relatively featureless market periods a continuous process of price
adjustment goes on, under which secondary issues that were undervalued
may rise at least to the normal level for their type of security. Fifth,
the specific factors that in many cases made for a disappointing record
of earnings may be corrected by the advent of new conditions, or the
adoption of new policies, or by a change in management.</p>
<p>An important new factor in recent years has been the acquisition of
smaller companies by larger ones, usually as part of a diversification
program. In these cases the consideration paid has almost always been
relatively generous, and much in excess of the bargain levels existing
not long before.</p>
<p>When interest rates were much lower than in 1970, the field of
bargain issues extended to bonds and preferred stocks that sold at large
discounts from the amount of their claim. Currently we have a different
situation in which even well-secured issues sell at large discounts if
carrying coupon rates of, say, 4½% or less. Example: American Telephone
andandandand Telegraph 2 5/8s, due 1986, sold as low as 51 in 1970;
Deere andandandand Co. 4½s, due 1983, sold as low as 62. These may well
turn out to have been bargain opportunities before very long—if ruling
interest rates should decline substantially. For a bargain bond issue in
the more traditional sense perhaps we shall have to turn once more to
the first-mortgage bonds of railroads now in financial difficulties,
which sell in the 20s or 30s. Such situations are not for the inexpert
investor; lacking a real sense of values in this area, he may burn his
fingers. But there is an underlying tendency for market decline in this
field to be overdone; consequently the group as a whole offers an
especially rewarding invitation to careful and courageous analysis. In
the decade ending in 1948 the billion-dollar group of defaulted railroad
bonds presented numerous and spectacular opportunities in this area.
Such opportunities have been quite scarce since then; but they seem
likely to return in the 1970s.*</p>
<p>Special Situations, or “Workouts”</p>
<p>Not so long ago this was a field which could almost guarantee an
attractive rate of return to those who knew their way around in it; and
this was true under almost any sort of general market situation. It was
not actually forbidden territory to members of the general public. Some
who had a flair for this sort of thing could learn the ropes and become
pretty capable practitioners without the necessity of long academic
study or apprenticeship. Others have been keen enough to recognize the
underlying soundness of this approach and to attach themselves to bright
young men who handled funds devoted chiefly to these “special
situations.” But in recent years, for reasons we shall develop later,
the field of “arbitrages and workouts” became riskier and less
profitable. It may be that in years to come conditions in this field
will become more propitious. In any case it is worthwhile outlining the
general nature and origin of these operations, with one or two
illustrative examples.</p>
<p>The typical “special situation” has grown out of the increasing
number of acquisitions of smaller firms by large ones, as the gospel of
diversification of products has been adopted by more and more
managements. It often appears good business for such an enterprise to
acquire an existing company in the field it wishes to enter rather than
to start a new venture from scratch. In order to make such acquisition
possible, and to obtain acceptance of the deal by the required large
majority of shareholders of the smaller company, it is almost always
necessary to offer a price considerably above the current level. Such
corporate moves have been producing interesting profit-making
opportunities for those who have made a study of this field, and have
good judgment fortified by ample experience.</p>
<p>A great deal of money was made by shrewd investors not so many years
ago through the purchase of bonds of railroads in bankruptcy—bonds which
they knew would be worth much more than their cost when the railroads
were finally reorganized. After promulgation of the plans of
reorganization a “when issued” market for the new securities appeared.
These could almost always be sold for considerably more than the cost of
the old issues which were to be exchanged therefor. There were risks of
nonconsummation of the plans or of unexpected delays, but on the whole
such “arbitrage operations” proved highly profitable.</p>
<p>There were similar opportunities growing out of the breakup of
public-utility holding companies pursuant to 1935 legislation. Nearly
all these enterprises proved to be worth considerably more when changed
from holding companies to a group of separate operating companies.</p>
<p>The underlying factor here is the tendency of the security markets to
undervalue issues that are involved in any sort of complicated legal
proceedings. An old Wall Street motto has been: “Never buy into a
lawsuit.” This may be sound advice to the speculator seeking quick
action on his holdings. But the adoption of this attitude by the general
public is bound to create bargain opportunities in the securities
affected by it, since the prejudice against them holds their prices down
to unduly low levels.*</p>
<p>The exploitation of special situations is a technical branch of
investment which requires a somewhat unusual mentality and equipment.
Probably only a small percentage of our enterprising investors are
likely to engage in it, and this book is not the appropriate medium for
expounding its complications.6</p>
<p>Broader Implications of Our Rules for Investment</p>
<p>Investment policy, as it has been developed here, depends in the
first place on a choice by the investor of either the defensive
(passive) or aggressive (enterprising) role. The aggressive investor
must have a considerable knowledge of security values—enough, in fact,
to warrant viewing his security operations as equivalent to a business
enterprise. There is no room in this philosophy for a middle ground, or
a series of gradations, between the passive and aggressive status. Many,
perhaps most, investors seek to place themselves in such an intermediate
category; in our opinion that is a compromise that is more likely to
produce disappointment than achievement.</p>
<p>As an investor you cannot soundly become “half a businessman,”
expecting thereby to achieve half the normal rate of business profits on
your funds.</p>
<p>It follows from this reasoning that the majority of security owners
should elect the defensive classification. They do not have the time, or
the determination, or the mental equipment to embark upon investing as a
quasi-business. They should therefore be satisfied with the excellent
return now obtainable from a defensive portfolio (and with even less),
and they should stoutly resist the recurrent temptation to increase this
return by deviating into other paths.</p>
<p>The enterprising investor may properly embark upon any security
operation for which his training and judgment are adequate and which
appears sufficiently promising when measured by established business
standards.</p>
<p>In our recommendations and caveats for this group of investors we
have attempted to apply such business standards. In those for the
defensive investor we have been guided largely by the three requirements
of underlying safety, simplicity of choice, and promise of satisfactory
results, in terms of psychology as well as arithmetic. The use of these
criteria has led us to exclude from the field of recommended investment
a number of security classes that are normally regarded as suitable for
various kinds of investors. These prohibitions were listed in our first
chapter on p. 30.</p>
<p>Let us consider a little more fully than before what is implied in
these exclusions. We have advised against the purchase at “full prices”
of three important categories of securities: (1) foreign bonds, (2)
ordinary preferred stocks, and (3) secondary common stocks, including,
of course, original offerings of such issues. By “full prices” we mean
prices close to par for bonds or preferred stocks, and prices that
represent about the fair business value of the enterprise in the case of
common stocks. The greater number of defensive investors are to avoid
these categories regardless of price; the enterprising investor is to
buy them only when obtainable at bargain prices—which we define as
prices not more than two-thirds of the appraisal value of the
securities.</p>
<p>What would happen if all investors were guided by our advice in these
matters? That question was considered in regard to foreign bonds, on
p. 138, and we have nothing to add at this point. Investment-grade
preferred stocks would be bought solely by corporations, such as
insurance companies, which would benefit from the special income-tax
status of stock issues owned by them.</p>
<p>The most troublesome consequence of our policy of exclusion is in the
field of secondary common stocks. If the majority of investors, being in
the defensive class, are not to buy them at all, the field of possible
buyers becomes seriously restricted. Furthermore, if aggressive
investors are to buy them only at bargain levels, then these issues
would be doomed to sell for less than their fair value, except to the
extent that they were purchased unintelligently.</p>
<p>This may sound severe and even vaguely unethical. Yet in truth we are
merely recognizing what has actually happened in this area for the
greater part of the past 40 years. Secondary issues, for the most part,
do fluctuate about a central level which is well below their fair value.
They reach and even surpass that value at times; but this occurs in the
upper reaches of bull markets, when the lessons of practical experience
would argue against the soundness of paying the prevailing prices for
common stocks.</p>
<p>Thus we are suggesting only that the aggressive investor recognize
the facts of life as it is lived by secondary issues and that they
accept the central market levels that are normal for that class as their
guide in fixing their own levels for purchase.</p>
<p>There is a paradox here, nevertheless. The average well-selected
secondary company may be fully as promising as the average industrial
leader. What the smaller concern lacks in inherent stability it may
readily make up in superior possibilities of growth. Consequently it may
appear illogical to many readers to term “unintelligent” the purchase of
such secondary issues at their full “enterprise value.” We think that
the strongest logic is that of experience. Financial history says
clearly that the investor may expect satisfactory results, on the
average, from secondary common stocks only if he buys them for less than
their value to a private owner, that is, on a bargain basis.</p>
<p>The last sentence indicates that this principle relates to the
ordinary outside investor. Anyone who can control a secondary company,
or who is part of a cohesive group with such control, is fully justified
in buying the shares on the same basis as if he were investing in a
“close corporation” or other private business. The distinction between
the position, and consequent investment policy, of insiders and of
outsiders becomes more important as the enterprise itself becomes less
important. It is a basic characteristic of a primary or leading company
that a single detached share is ordinarily worth as much as a share in a
controlling block. In secondary companies the average market value of a
detached share is substantially less than its worth to a controlling
owner. Because of this fact, the matter of shareholder-management
relations and of those between inside and outside shareholders tends to
be much more important and controversial in the case of secondary than
in that of primary companies.</p>
<p>At the end of Chapter 5 we commented on the difficulty of making any
hard and fast distinction between primary and secondary companies. The
many common stocks in the boundary area may properly exhibit an
intermediate price behavior. It would not be illogical for an investor
to buy such an issue at a small discount from its indicated or appraisal
value, on the theory that it is only a small distance away from a
primary classification and that it may acquire such a rating
unqualifiedly in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>Thus the distinction between primary and secondary issues need not be
made too precise; for, if it were, then a small difference in quality
must produce a large differential in justified purchase price. In saying
this we are admitting a middle ground in the classification of common
stocks, although we counseled against such a middle ground in the
classification of investors. Our reason for this apparent inconsistency
is as follows: No great harm comes from some uncertainty of viewpoint
regarding a single security, because such cases are exceptional and not
a great deal is at stake in the matter. But the investor’s choice as
between the defensive or the aggressive status is of major consequence
to him, and he should not allow himself to be confused or compromised in
this basic decision.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 7</p>
<p>It requires a great deal of boldness and a great deal of caution to
make a great fortune; and when you have got it, it requires ten times as
much wit to keep it.</p>
<p>—Nathan Mayer Rothschild</p>
<p>Timing is Nothing</p>
<p>In an ideal world, the intelligent investor would hold stocks only
when they are cheap and sell them when they become overpriced, then duck
into the bunker of bonds and cash until stocks again become cheap enough
to buy. From 1966 through late 2001, one study claimed, held
continuously in stocks would have grown to 1.71. But if you had gotten
out of stocks right before the five worst days of each year, your
original would have grown to 87.12.1</p>
<p>Like most magical market ideas, this one is based on sleight of hand.
How, exactly, would you (or anyone) figure out which days will be the
worst days—before they arrive? On January 7, 1973, the New York Times
featured an interview with one of the nation’s top financial
forecasters, who urged investors to buy stocks without hesitation: “It’s
very rare that you can be as unqualifiedly bullish as you can now.” That
forecaster was named Alan Greenspan, and it’s very rare that anyone has
ever been so unqualifiedly wrong as the future Federal Reserve chairman
was that day: 1973 and 1974 turned out to be the worst years for
economic growth and the stock market since the Great Depression.2</p>
<p>Can professionals time the market any better than Alan Green-span? “I
see no reason not to think the majority of the decline is behind us,”
declared Kate Leary Lee, president of the market-timing firm of R. M.
Leary andandandand Co., on December 3, 2001. “This is when you want to
be in the market,” she added, predicting that stocks “look good” for the
first quarter of 2002.3 Over the next three months, stocks earned a
measly 0.28% return, underperforming cash by 1.5 percentage points.</p>
<p>Leary is not alone. A study by two finance professors at Duke
University found that if you had followed the recommendations of the
best 10% of all market-timing newsletters, you would have earned a 12.6%
annualized return from 1991 through 1995. But if you had ignored them
and kept your money in a stock index fund, you would have earned
16.4%.4</p>
<p>As the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard noted, life can only be
understood backwards—but it must be lived forwards. Looking back, you
can always see exactly when you should have bought and sold your stocks.
But don’t let that fool you into thinking you can see, in real time,
just when to get in and out. In the financial markets, hindsight is
forever 20/20, but foresight is legally blind. And thus, for most
investors, market timing is a practical and emotional
impossibility.5</p>
<p>What Goes Up…</p>
<p>Like spacecraft that pick up speed as they rise into the Earth’s
stratosphere, growth stocks often seem to defy gravity. Let’s look at
the trajectories of three of the hottest growth stocks of the 1990s:
General Electric, Home Depot, and Sun Microsystems. (See Figure
7-1.)</p>
<p>In every year from 1995 through 1999, each grew bigger and more
profitable. Revenues doubled at Sun and more than doubled at Home Depot.
According to Value Line, GE’s revenues grew 29%; its earnings rose 65%.
At Home Depot and Sun, earnings per share roughly tripled.</p>
<p>But something else was happening—and it wouldn’t have surprised
Graham one bit. The faster these companies grew, the more expensive
their stocks became. And when stocks grow faster than companies,
investors always end up sorry. As Figure 7-2 shows:</p>
<p>A great company is not a great investment if you pay too much for the
stock.</p>
<p>The more a stock has gone up, the more it seems likely to keep going
up. But that instinctive belief is flatly contradicted by a fundamental
law of financial physics: The bigger they get, the slower they grow. A
-billion company can double its sales fairly easily; but where can a
0-billion company turn to find another 0 billion in business?</p>
<p>Growth stocks are worth buying when their prices are reasonable, but
when their price/earnings ratios go much above 25 or 30 the odds get
ugly:</p>
<p>Journalist Carol Loomis found that, from 1960 through 1999, only
eight of the largest 150 companies on the Fortune 500 list managed to
raise their earnings by an annual average of at least 15% for two
decades.6</p>
<p>Looking at five decades of data, the research firm of Sanford C.
Bernstein andandandand Co. showed that only 10% of large U.S. companies
had increased their earnings by 20% for at least five consecutive years;
only 3% had grown by 20% for at least 10 years straight; and not a
single one had done it for 15 years in a row.7</p>
<p>An academic study of thousands of U.S. stocks from 1951 through 1998
found that over all 10-year periods, net earnings grew by an average of
9.7% annually. But for the biggest 20% of companies, earnings grew by an
annual average of just 9.3%.8</p>
<p>FIGURE 7-2 Look Out Below</p>
<p>n/a: Not applicable; Sun had net loss in 2002.</p>
<p>Sources: www.morningstar.com, yahoo.marketguide.com</p>
<p>Even many corporate leaders fail to understand these odds (see
sidebar on p. 184). The intelligent investor, however, gets interested
in big growth stocks not when they are at their most popular—but when
something goes wrong. In July 2002, Johnson andandandand Johnson
announced that Federal regulators were investigating accusations of
false record keeping at one of its drug factories, and the stock lost
16% in a single day. That took J andandandand J’s share price down from
24 times the previous 12 months’ earnings to just 20 times. At that
lower level, Johnson andandandand Johnson might once again have become a
growth stock with room to grow—making it an example of what Graham calls
“the relatively unpopular large company.”9</p>
<p>This kind of temporary unpopularity can create lasting wealth by
enabling you to buy a great company at a good price.</p>
<p>HIGH POTENTIAL FOR HYPE POTENTIAL</p>
<p>Investors aren’t the only people who fall prey to the delusion that
hyper-growth can go on forever. In February 2000, chief executive John
Roth of Nortel Networks was asked how much bigger his giant fiber-optics
company could get. “The industry is growing 14% to 15% a year,” Roth
replied, “and we’re going to grow six points faster than that. For a
company our size, that’s pretty heady stuff.” Nortel’s stock, up nearly
51% annually over the previous six years, was then trading at 87 times
what Wall Street was guessing it might earn in 2000. Was the stock
overpriced? “It’s getting up there,” shrugged Roth, “but there’s still
plenty of room to grow our valuation as we execute on the wireless
strategy.” (After all, he added, Cisco Systems was trading at 121 times
its projected earnings!)1</p>
<p>As for Cisco, in November 2000, its chief executive, John Chambers,
insisted that his company could keep growing at least 50% annually.
“Logic,” he declared, “would indicate this is a breakaway.” Cisco’s
stock had come way down—it was then trading at a mere 98 times its
earnings over the previous year—and Chambers urged investors to buy. “So
who you going to bet on?” he asked. “Now may be the opportunity.”2</p>
<p>Instead, these growth companies shrank—and their overpriced stocks
shriveled. Nortel’s revenues fell by 37% in 2001, and the company lost
more than 6 billion that year. Cisco’s revenues did rise by 18% in 2001,
but the company ended up with a net loss of more than billion. Nortel’s
stock, at 13.50 when Roth spoke, finished 2002 at .65. Cisco’s shares,
at 2 when Chambers called his company a “break-away,” crumbled to 3.</p>
<p>Both companies have since become more circumspect about forecasting
the future.</p>
<p>Should You Put All Your Eggs in One Basket?</p>
<p>“Put all your eggs into one basket and then watch that basket,”
proclaimed Andrew Carnegie a century ago. “Do not scatter your shot….
The great successes of life are made by concentration.” As Graham points
out, “the really big fortunes from common stocks” have been made by
people who packed all their money into one investment they knew
supremely well.</p>
<p>Nearly all the richest people in America trace their wealth to a
concentrated investment in a single industry or even a single company
(think Bill Gates and Microsoft, Sam Walton and Wal-Mart, or the
Rockefellers and Standard Oil). The Forbes 400 list of the richest
Americans, for example, has been dominated by undiversified fortunes
ever since it was first compiled in 1982.</p>
<p>However, almost no small fortunes have been made this way—and not
many big fortunes have been kept this way. What Carnegie neglected to
mention is that concentration also makes most of the great failures of
life. Look again at the Forbes “Rich List.” Back in 1982, the average
net worth of a Forbes 400 member was 30 million. To make it onto the
2002 Forbes 400, the average 1982 member needed to earn only a 4.5%
average annual return on his wealth—during a period when even bank
accounts yielded far more than that and the stock market gained an
annual average of 13.2%.</p>
<p>So how many of the Forbes 400 fortunes from 1982 remained on the list
20 years later? Only 64 of the original members—a measly 16%—were still
on the list in 2002. By keeping all their eggs in the one basket that
had gotten them onto the list in the first place—once-booming industries
like oil and gas, or computer hardware, or basic manufacturing—all the
other original members fell away. When hard times hit, none of these
people—despite all the huge advantages that great wealth can bring—were
properly prepared. They could only stand by and wince at the sickening
crunch as the constantly changing economy crushed their only basket and
all their eggs.10</p>
<p>The Bargain Bin</p>
<p>You might think that in our endlessly networked world, it would be a
cinch to build and buy a list of stocks that meet Graham’s criteria for
bargains (p. 169). Although the Internet is a help, you’ll still have to
do much of the work by hand.</p>
<p>Grab a copy of today’s Wall Street Journal, turn to the “Money
andandandand Investing” section, and take a look at the NYSE and NASDAQ
Scorecards to find the day’s lists of stocks that have hit new lows for
the past year—a quick and easy way to search for companies that might
pass Graham’s net-working-capital tests. (Online, try http://quote.
morningstar.com/highlow.html?msection=HighLow.)</p>
<p>To see whether a stock is selling for less than the value of net
working capital (what Graham’s followers call “net nets”), download or
request the most recent quarterly or annual report from the company’s
website or from the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. From the company’s
current assets, subtract its total liabilities, including any preferred
stock and long-term debt. (Or consult your local public library’s copy
of the Value Line Investment Survey, saving yourself a costly annual
subscription. Each issue carries a list of “Bargain Basement Stocks”
that come close to Graham’s definition.) Most of these stocks lately
have been in bombed-out areas like high-tech and telecommunications.</p>
<p>As of October 31, 2002, for instance, Comverse Technology had .4
billion in current assets and .0 billion in total liabilities, giving it
.4 billion in net working capital. With fewer than 190 million shares of
stock, and a stock price under per share, Comverse had a total market
capitalization of just under .4 billion. With the stock priced at no
more than the value of Comverse’s cash and inventories, the company’s
ongoing business was essentially selling for nothing. As Graham knew,
you can still lose money on a stock like Comverse—which is why you
should buy them only if you can find a couple dozen at a time and hold
them patiently. But on the very rare occasions when Mr. Market generates
that many true bargains, you’re all but certain to make money.</p>
<p>What’s Your Foreign Policy?</p>
<p>Investing in foreign stocks may not be mandatory for the intelligent
investor, but it is definitely advisable. Why? Let’s try a little
thought experiment. It’s the end of 1989, and you’re Japanese. Here are
the facts:</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years, your stock market has gained an annual
average of 21.2%, well ahead of the 17.5% annual gains in the United
States.</p>
<p>Japanese companies are buying up everything in the United States from
the Pebble Beach golf course to Rockefeller Center; meanwhile, American
firms like Drexel Burnham Lambert, Financial Corp. of America, and
Texaco are going bankrupt.</p>
<p>The U.S. high-tech industry is dying. Japan’s is booming.</p>
<p>In 1989, in the land of the rising sun, you can only conclude that
investing outside of Japan is the dumbest idea since sushi vending
machines. Naturally, you put all your money in Japanese stocks.</p>
<p>The result? Over the next decade, you lose roughly two-thirds of your
money.</p>
<p>The lesson? It’s not that you should never invest in foreign markets
like Japan; it’s that the Japanese should never have kept all their
money at home. And neither should you. If you live in the United States,
work in the United States, and get paid in U.S. dollars, you are already
making a multilayered bet on the U.S. economy. To be prudent, you should
put some of your investment portfolio elsewhere—simply because no one,
anywhere, can ever know what the future will bring at home or abroad.
Putting up to a third of your stock money in mutual funds that hold
foreign stocks (including those in emerging markets) helps insure
against the risk that our own backyard may not always be the best place
in the world to invest.</p>
