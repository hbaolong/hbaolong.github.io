<p>Convertible Issues and Warrants</p>
<p>Convertible bonds and preferred stocks have been taking on a
predominant importance in recent years in the field of senior financing.
As a parallel development, stock-option warrants—which are long-term
rights to buy common shares at stipulated prices—have become more and
more numerous. More than half the preferred issues now quoted in the
Standard andandandand Poor’s Stock Guide have conversion privileges, and
this has been true also of a major part of the corporate bond financing
in 1968–1970. There are at least 60 different series of stock-option
warrants dealt in on the American Stock Exchange. In 1970, for the first
time in its history, the New York Stock Exchange listed an issue of
long-term warrants, giving rights to buy 31,400,000 American Tel.
andandandand Tel. shares at 2 each. With “Mother Bell” now leading that
procession, it is bound to be augmented by many new fabricators of
warrants. (As we shall point out later, they are a fabrication in more
than one sense.)*</p>
<p>In the overall picture the convertible issues rank as much more
important than the warrants, and we shall discuss them first. There are
two main aspects to be considered from the standpoint of the investor.
First, how do they rank as investment opportunities and risks? Second,
how does their existence affect the value of the related common-stock
issues?</p>
<p>Convertible issues are claimed to be especially advantageous to both
the investor and the issuing corporation. The investor receives the
superior protection of a bond or preferred stock, plus the opportunity
to participate in any substantial rise in the value of the common stock.
The issuer is able to raise capital at a moderate interest or preferred
dividend cost, and if the expected prosperity materializes the issuer
will get rid of the senior obligation by having it exchanged into common
stock. Thus both sides to the bargain will fare unusually well.</p>
<p>Obviously the foregoing paragraph must overstate the case somewhere,
for you cannot by a mere ingenious device make a bargain much better for
both sides. In exchange for the conversion privilege the investor
usually gives up something important in quality or yield, or both. 1
Conversely, if the company gets its money at lower cost because of the
conversion feature, it is surrendering in return part of the common
shareholders’ claim to future enhancement. On this subject there are a
number of tricky arguments to be advanced both pro and con. The safest
conclusion that can be reached is that convertible issues are like any
other form of security, in that their form itself guarantees neither
attractiveness nor unattractiveness. That question will depend on all
the facts surrounding the individual issue.*</p>
<p>We do know, however, that the group of convertible issues floated
during the latter part of a bull market are bound to yield
unsatisfactory results as a whole. (It is at such optimistic periods,
unfortunately, that most of the convertible financing has been done in
the past.) The poor consequences must be inevitable, from the timing
itself, since a wide decline in the stock market must invariably make
the conversion privilege much less attractive—and often, also, call into
question the underlying safety of the issue itself.† As a group
illustration we shall retain the example used in our first edition of
the relative price behavior of convertible and straight (nonconvertible)
preferreds offered in 1946, the closing year of the bull market
preceding the extraordinary one that began in 1949.</p>
<p>TABLE 16-1 Price Record of New Preferred-Stock Issues Offered in
1946</p>
<p>A comparable presentation is difficult to make for the years
1967–1970, because there were virtually no new offerings of
nonconvertibles in those years. But it is easy to demonstrate that the
average price decline of convertible preferred stocks from December 1967
to December 1970 was greater than that for common stocks as a whole
(which lost only 5%). Also the convertibles seem to have done quite a
bit worse than the older straight preferred shares during the period
December 1968 to December 1970, as is shown by the sample of 20 issues
of each kind in Table 16-2. These comparisons would demonstrate that
convertible securities as a whole have relatively poor quality as senior
issues and also are tied to common stocks that do worse than the general
market except during a speculative upsurge. These observations do not
apply to all convertible issues, of course. In the 1968 and 1969
particularly, a fair number of strong companies used convertible issues
to combat the inordinately high interest rates for even first-quality
bonds. But it is noteworthy that in our 20-stock sample of convertible
preferreds only one showed an advance and 14 suffered bad declines.*</p>
<p>TABLE 16-2 Price Record of Preferred Stocks, Common Stocks, and
Warrants, December 1970 versus December 1968</p>
<p>(Based on Random Samples of 20 Issues Each)</p>
<p>(Standard andandandand Poor’s composite index of 500 common stocks
declined 11.3%.)</p>
<p>The conclusion to be drawn from these figures is not that convertible
issues are in themselves less desirable than nonconvertible or
“straight” securities. Other things being equal, the opposite is true.
But we clearly see that other things are not equal in practice and that
the addition of the conversion privilege often—perhaps generally—betrays
an absence of genuine investment quality for the issue.</p>
<p>It is true, of course, that a convertible preferred is safer than the
common stock of the same company—that is to say, it carries smaller risk
of eventual loss of principal. Consequently those who buy new
convertibles instead of the corresponding common stock are logical to
that extent. But in most cases the common would not have been an
intelligent purchase to begin with, at the ruling price, and the
substitution of the convertible preferred did not improve the picture
sufficiently. Furthermore, a good deal of the buying of convertibles was
done by investors who had no special interest or confidence in the
common stock—that is, they would never have thought of buying the common
at the time—but who were tempted by what seemed an ideal combination of
a prior claim plus a conversion privilege close to the current market.
In a number of instances this combination has worked out well, but the
statistics seem to show that it is more likely to prove a pitfall.</p>
<p>In connection with the ownership of convertibles there is a special
problem which most investors fail to realize. Even when a profit appears
it brings a dilemma with it. Should the holder sell on a small rise;
should he hold for a much bigger advance; if the issue is called—as
often happens when the common has gone up considerably—should he sell
out then or convert into and retain the common stock?*</p>
<p>Let us talk in concrete terms. You buy a 6% bond at 100, convertible
into stock at 25—that is, at the rate of 40 shares for each ,000 bond.
The stock goes to 30, which makes the bond worth at least 120, and so it
sells at 125. You either sell or hold. If you hold, hoping for a higher
price, you are pretty much in the position of a common shareholder,
since if the stock goes down your bond will go down too. A conservative
person is likely to say that beyond 125 his position has become too
speculative, and therefore he sells and makes a gratifying 25%
profit.</p>
<p>So far, so good. But pursue the matter a bit. In many cases where the
holder sells at 125 the common stock continues to advance, carrying the
convertible with it, and the investor experiences that peculiar pain
that comes to the man who has sold out much too soon. The next time, he
decides to hold for 150 or 200. The issue goes up to 140 and he does not
sell. Then the market breaks and his bond slides down to 80. Again he
has done the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Aside from the mental anguish involved in making these bad
guesses—and they seem to be almost inevitable—there is a real
arithmetical drawback to operations in convertible issues. It may be
assumed that a stern and uniform policy of selling at 25% or 30% profit
will work out best as applied to many holdings. This would then mark the
upper limit of profit and would be realized only on the issues that
worked out well. But, if—as appears to be true—these issues often lack
adequate underlying security and tend to be floated and purchased in the
latter stages of a bull market, then a goodly proportion of them will
fail to rise to 125 but will not fail to collapse when the market turns
downward. Thus the spectacular opportunities in convertibles prove to be
illusory in practice, and the overall experience is marked by fully as
many substantial losses—at least of a temporary kind—as there are gains
of similar magnitude.</p>
<p>Because of the extraordinary length of the 1950–1968 bull market,
convertible issues as a whole gave a good account of themselves for some
18 years. But this meant only that the great majority of common stocks
enjoyed large advances, in which most convertible issues were able to
share. The soundness of investment in convertible issues can only be
tested by their performance in a declining stock market—and this has
always proved disappointing as a whole.*</p>
<p>In our first edition (1949) we gave an illustration of this special
problem of “what to do” with a convertible when it goes up. We believe
it still merits inclusion here. Like several of our references it is
based on our own investment operations. We were members of a “select
group,” mainly of investment funds, who participated in a private
offering of convertible 4½% debentures of Eversharp Co. at par,
convertible into common stock at 0 per share. The stock advanced rapidly
to 65½, and then (after a three-for-two split) to the equivalent of 88.
The latter price made the convertible debentures worth no less than 220.
During this period the two issues were called at a small premium; hence
they were practically all converted into common stock, which was
retained by a number of the original investment-fund buyers of the
debentures. The price promptly began a severe decline, and in March 1948
the stock sold as low as 7 3/8. This represented a value of only 27 for
the debenture issues, or a loss of 75% of the original price instead of
a profit of over 100%.</p>
<p>The real point of this story is that some of the original purchasers
converted their bonds into the stock and held the stock through its
great decline. In so doing they ran counter to an old maxim of Wall
Street, which runs: “Never convert a convertible bond.” Why this advice?
Because once you convert you have lost your strategic combination of
prior claimant to interest plus a chance for an attractive profit. You
have probably turned from investor into speculator, and quite often at
an unpropitious time (because the stock has already had a large
advance). If “Never convert a convertible” is a good rule, how came it
that these experienced fund managers exchanged their Eversharp bonds for
stock, to their subsequent embarrassing loss? The answer, no doubt, is
that they let themselves be carried away by enthusiasm for the company’s
prospects as well as by the “favorable market action” of the shares.
Wall Street has a few prudent principles; the trouble is that they are
always forgotten when they are most needed.* Hence that other famous
dictum of the old-timers: “Do as I say, not as I do.”</p>
<p>Our general attitude toward new convertible issues is thus a
mistrustful one. We mean here, as in other similar observations, that
the investor should look more than twice before he buys them. After such
hostile scrutiny he may find some exceptional offerings that are too
good to refuse. The ideal combination, of course, is a strongly secured
convertible, exchangeable for a common stock which itself is attractive,
and at a price only slightly higher than the current market. Every now
and then a new offering appears that meets these requirements. By the
nature of the securities markets, however, you are more likely to find
such an opportunity in some older issue which has developed into a
favorable position rather than in a new flotation. (If a new issue is a
really strong one, it is not likely to have a good conversion
privilege.)</p>
<p>The fine balance between what is given and what is withheld in a
standard-type convertible issue is well illustrated by the extensive use
of this type of security in the financing of American Telephone
andandandand Telegraph Company. Between 1913 and 1957 the company sold
at least nine separate issues of convertible bonds, most of them through
subscription rights to shareholders. The convertible bonds had the
important advantage to the company of bringing in a much wider class of
buyers than would have been available for a stock offering, since the
bonds were popular with many financial institutions which possess huge
resources but some of which were not permitted to buy stocks. The
interest return on the bonds has generally been less than half the
corresponding dividend yield on the stock—a factor that was calculated
to offset the prior claim of the bondholders. Since the company
maintained its dividend rate for 40 years (from 1919 to the stock split
in 1959) the result was the eventual conversion of virtually all the
convertible issues into common stock. Thus the buyers of these
convertibles have fared well through the years—but not quite so well as
if they had bought the capital stock in the first place. This example
establishes the soundness of American Telephone andandandand Telegraph,
but not the intrinsic attractiveness of convertible bonds. To prove them
sound in practice we should need to have a number of instances in which
the convertible worked out well even though the common stock proved
disappointing. Such instances are not easy to find.*</p>
<p>Effect of Convertible Issues on the Status of the Common Stock</p>
<p>In a large number of cases convertibles have been issued in
connection with mergers or new acquisitions. Perhaps the most striking
example of this financial operation was the issuance by the NVF Corp. of
nearly 00,000,000 of its 5% convertible bonds (plus warrants) in
exchange for most of the common stock of Sharon Steel Co. This
extraordinary deal is discussed below pp. 429–433. Typically the
transaction results in a pro forma increase in the reported earnings per
share of common stock; the shares advance in response to their larger
earnings, so-called, but also because the management has given evidence
of its energy, enterprise, and ability to make more money for the
shareholders.* But there are two offsetting factors, one of which is
practically ignored and the other entirely so in optimistic markets. The
first is the actual dilution of the current and future earnings on the
common stock that flows arithmetically from the new conversion rights.
This dilution can be quantified by taking the recent earnings, or
assuming some other figures, and calculating the adjusted earnings per
share if all the convertible shares or bonds were actually converted. In
the majority of companies the resulting reduction in per-share figures
is not significant. But there are numerous exceptions to this statement,
and there is danger that they will grow at an uncomfortable rate. The
fast-expanding “conglomerates” have been the chief practitioners of
convertible legerdemain. In Table 16-3 we list seven companies with
large amounts of stock issuable on conversions or against warrants.†</p>
<p>Indicated Switches from Common into Preferred Stocks</p>
<p>For decades before, say, 1956, common stocks yielded more than the
preferred stocks of the same companies; this was particularly true if
the preferred stock had a conversion privilege close to the market. The
reverse is generally true at present. As a result there are a
considerable number of convertible preferred stocks which are clearly
more attractive than the related common shares. Owners of the common
have nothing to lose and important advantages to gain by switching from
their junior shares into the senior issue.</p>
<p>TABLE 16-3 Companies with Large Amounts of Convertible Issues and
Warrants at the End of 1969 (Shares in Thousands)</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: A typical example was presented by Studebaker-Worthington
Corp. at the close of 1970. The common sold at 57, while the convertible
preferred finished at 87½. Each preferred share is exchangeable for 1½
shares of common, then worth 85½. This would indicate a small money
difference against the buyer of the preferred. But dividends are being
paid on the common at the annual rate of .20 (or .80 for the 1½ shares),
against the obtainable on one share of preferred. Thus the original
adverse difference in price would probably be made up in less than a
year, after which the preferred would probably return an appreciably
higher dividend yield than the common for some time to come. But most
important, of course, would be the senior position that the common
shareholder would gain from the switch. At the low prices of 1968 and
again in 1970 the preferred sold 15 points higher than 1½ shares of
common. Its conversion privilege guarantees that it could never sell
lower than the common package.2</p>
<p>Stock-Option Warrants</p>
<p>Let us mince no words at the outset. We consider the recent
development of stock-option warrants as a near fraud, an existing
menace, and a potential disaster. They have created huge aggregate
dollar “values” out of thin air. They have no excuse for existence
except to the extent that they mislead speculators and investors. They
should be prohibited by law, or at least strictly limited to a minor
part of the total capitalization of a company.*</p>
<p>For an analogy in general history and in literature we refer the
reader to the section of Faust (part 2), in which Goethe describes the
invention of paper money. As an ominous precedent on Wall Street
history, we may mention the warrants of American andandandand Foreign
Power Co., which in 1929 had a quoted market value of over a billion
dollars, although they appeared only in a footnote to the company’s
balance sheet. By 1932 this billion dollars had shrunk to million, and
in 1952 the warrants were wiped out in the company’s
recapitalization—even though it had remained solvent.</p>
<p>Originally, stock-option warrants were attached now and then to bond
issues, and were usually equivalent to a partial conversion privilege.
They were unimportant in amount, and hence did no harm. Their use
expanded in the late 1920s, along with many other financial abuses, but
they dropped from sight for long years thereafter. They were bound to
turn up again, like the bad pennies they are, and since 1967 they have
become familiar “instruments of finance.” In fact a standard procedure
has developed for raising the capital for new real-estate ventures,
affiliates of large banks, by selling units of an equal number of common
shares and warrants to buy additional common shares at the same price.
Example: In 1971 CleveTrust Realty Investors sold 2,500,000 of these
combinations of common stock (or “shares of beneficial interest”) and
warrants, for 0 per unit.</p>
<p>Let us consider for a moment what is really involved in this
financial setup. Ordinarily, a common-stock issue has the first right to
buy additional common shares when the company’s directors find it
desirable to raise capital in this manner. This so-called “preemptive
right” is one of the elements of value entering into the ownership of
common stock—along with the right to receive dividends, to participate
in the company’s growth, and to vote for directors. When separate
warrants are issued for the right to subscribe additional capital, that
action takes away part of the value inherent in an ordinary common share
and transfers it to a separate certificate. An analogous thing could be
done by issuing separate certificates for the right to receive dividends
(for a limited or unlimited period), or the right to share in the
proceeds of sale or liquidation of the enterprise, or the right to vote
the shares. Why then are these subscription warrants created as part of
the original capital structure? Simply because people are inexpert in
financial matters. They don’t realize that the common stock is worth
less with warrants outstanding than otherwise. Hence the package of
stock and warrants usually commands a better price in the market than
would the stock alone. Note that in the usual company reports the
per-share earnings are (or have been) computed without proper allowance
for the effect of outstanding warrants. The result is, of course, to
overstate the true relationship between the earnings and the market
value of the company’s capitalization.*</p>
<p>The simplest and probably the best method of allowing for the
existence of warrants is to add the equivalent of their market value to
the common-share capitalization, thus increasing the “true” market price
per share. Where large amounts of warrants have been issued in
connection with the sale of senior securities, it is customary to make
the adjustment by assuming that the proceeds of the stock payment are
used to retire the related bonds or preferred shares. This method does
not allow adequately for the usual “premium value” of a warrant above
exercisable value. In Table 16-4 we compare the effect of the two
methods of calculation in the case of National General Corp. for the
year 1970.</p>
<p>Does the company itself derive an advantage from the creation of
these warrants, in the sense that they assure it in some way of
receiving additional capital when it needs some? Not at all. Ordinarily
there is no way in which the company can require the warrant-holders to
exercise their rights, and thus provide new capital to the company,
prior to the expiration date of the warrants. In the meantime, if the
company wants to raise additional common-stock funds it must offer the
shares to its shareholders in the usual way—which means somewhat under
the ruling market price. The warrants are no help in such an operation;
they merely complicate the situation by frequently requiring a downward
revision in their own subscription price. Once more we assert that large
issues of stock-option warrants serve no purpose, except to fabricate
imaginary market values.</p>
<p>The paper money that Goethe was familiar with, when he wrote his
Faust, were the notorious French assignats that had been greeted as a
marvelous invention, and were destined ultimately to lose all of their
value—as did the billion dollars worth of American andandandand Foreign
Power warrants.* Some of the poet’s remarks apply equally well to one
invention or another—such as the following (in Bayard Taylor’s
translation):</p>
<p>TABLE 16-4 Calculation of “True Market Price” and Adjusted
Price/Earnings Ratio of a Common Stock with Large Amounts of Warrants
Outstanding</p>
<p>Note that, after special charges, the effect of the company’s
calculation is to increase the earnings per share and reduce the P/E
ratio. This is manifestly absurd. By our suggested method the effect of
the dilution is to increase the P/E ratio substantially, as it should
be.</p>

<p>Practical Postscript</p>
<p>The crime of the warrants is in “having been born.”* Once born they
function as other security forms, and offer chances of profit as well as
of loss. Nearly all the newer warrants run for a limited time—generally
between five and ten years. The older warrants were often perpetual, and
they were likely to have fascinating price histories over the years.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: The record books will show that Tri-Continental
Corp. warrants, which date from 1929, sold at a negligible 1/32 of a
dollar each in the depth of the depression. From that lowly estate their
price rose to a magnificent 75 3/4 in 1969, an astronomical advance of
some 242,000%. (The warrants then sold considerably higher than the
shares themselves; this is the kind of thing that occurs on Wall Street
through technical developments, such as stock splits.) A recent example
is supplied by Ling-Temco-Vought warrants, which in the first half of
1971 advanced from 2½ to 12½—and then fell back to 4.</p>
<p>No doubt shrewd operations can be carried on in warrants from time to
time, but this is too technical a matter for discussion here. We might
say that warrants tend to sell relatively higher than the corresponding
market components related to the conversion privilege of bonds or
preferred stocks. To that extent there is a valid argument for selling
bonds with warrants attached rather than creating an equivalent dilution
factor by a convertible issue. If the warrant total is relatively small
there is no point in taking its theoretical aspect too seriously; if the
warrant issue is large relative to the outstanding stock, that would
probably indicate that the company has a top-heavy senior
capitalization. It should be selling additional common stock instead.
Thus the main objective of our attack on warrants as a financial
mechanism is not to condemn their use in connection with moderate-size
bond issues, but to argue against the wanton creation of huge
“paper-money” monstrosities of this genre.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Graham detested warrants, as he makes clear on
pp. 413–416.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is pointing out that, despite the promotional rhetoric
that investors usually hear, convertible bonds do not automatically
offer “the best of both worlds.” Higher yield and lower risk do not
always go hand in hand. What Wall Street gives with one hand, it usually
takes away with the other. An investment may offer the best of one
world, or the worst of another; but the best of both worlds seldom
becomes available in a single package.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† According to Goldman Sachs and Ibbotson Associates, from 1998
through 2002, convertibles generated an average annual return of 4.8%.
That was considerably better than the 0.6% annual loss on U.S. stocks,
but substantially worse than the returns of medium-term corporate bonds
(a 7.5% annual gain) and long-term corporate bonds (an 8.3% annual
gain). In the mid-1990s, according to Merrill Lynch, roughly 5 billion
in convertibles were issued annually; by 1999, issuance had more than
doubled to 9 billion. In 2000, 8 billion in convertibles were issued,
and in 2001, another 05 billion emerged. As Graham warns, convertible
securities always come out of the woodwork near the end of a bull
market—largely because even poor-quality companies then have stock
returns high enough to make the conversion feature seem attractive.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recent structural changes in the convertible market have negated
some of these criticisms. Convertible preferred stock, which made up
roughly half the total convertible market in Graham’s day, now accounts
for only an eighth of the market. Maturities are shorter, making
convertible bonds less volatile, and many now carry “call protection,”
or assurances against early redemption. And more than half of all
convertibles are now investment grade, a significant improvement in
credit quality from Graham’s time. Thus, in 2002, the Merrill Lynch All
U.S. Convertible Index lost 8.6%—versus the 22.1% loss of the S
andandandand P 500-stock index and the 31.3% decline in the NASDAQ
Composite stock index.</p></li>
<li><p>A bond is “called” when the issuing corporation forcibly pays it
off ahead of the stated maturity date, or final due date for interest
payments. For a brief summary of how convertible bonds work, see Note 1
in the commentary on this chapter (p. 418).</p></li>
<li><p>In recent years, convertibles have tended to outperform the
Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index during declining stock
markets, but they have typically underperformed other bonds—which
weakens, but does not fully negate, the criticism Graham makes
here.</p></li>
<li><p>This sentence could serve as the epitaph for the bull market of
the 1990s. Among the “few prudent principles” that investors forgot were
such market clichés as “Trees don’t grow to the sky” and “Bulls make
money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered.”</p></li>
<li><p>ATandandandandT Corp. no longer is a significant issuer of
convertible bonds. Among the largest issuers of convertibles today are
General Motors, Merrill Lynch, Tyco International, and Roche.</p></li>
<li><p>For a further discussion of “pro forma” financial results, see
the commentary on Chapter 12.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† In recent years, convertible bonds have been heavily issued by
companies in the financial, health-care, and technology industries.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Warrants were an extremely widespread technique of corporate
finance in the nineteenth century and were fairly common even in
Graham’s day. They have since diminished in importance and
popularity—one of the few recent developments that would give Graham
unreserved pleasure. As of year-end 2002, there were only seven
remaining warrant issues on the New York Stock Exchange—only the ghostly
vestige of a market. Because warrants are no longer commonly used by
major companies, today’s investors should read the rest of Graham’s
chapter only to see how his logic works.</p></li>
<li><p>Today, the last remnant of activity in warrants is in the
cesspool of the NASDAQ “bulletin board,” or over-the-counter market for
tiny companies, where common stock is often bundled with warrants into a
“unit” (the contemporary equivalent of what Graham calls a “package”).
If a stockbroker ever offers to sell you “units” in any company, you can
be 95% certain that warrants are involved, and at least 90% certain that
the broker is either a thief or an idiot. Legitimate brokers and firms
have no business in this area.</p></li>
<li><p>The “notorious French assignats” were issued during the
Revolution of 1789. They were originally debts of the Revolutionary
government, purportedly secured by the value of the real estate that the
radicals had seized from the Catholic church and the nobility. But the
Revolutionaries were bad financial managers. In 1790, the interest rate
on assignats was cut; soon they stopped paying interest entirely and
were reclassified as paper money. But the government refused to redeem
them for gold or silver and issued massive amounts of new assignats.
They were officially declared worthless in 1797.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham, an enthusiastic reader of Spanish literature, is
paraphrasing a line from the play Life Is a Dream by Pedro Calderon de
la Barca (1600–1681): “The greatest crime of man is having been
born.”</p></li>

<p>Commentary on Chapter 16</p>
<p>That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die.</p>
<p>—I. Corinthians, XV:36.</p>
<p>The Zeal of the Convert</p>
<p>Although convertible bonds are called “bonds,” they behave like
stocks, work like options, and are cloaked in obscurity.</p>
<p>If you own a convertible, you also hold an option: You can either
keep the bond and continue to earn interest on it, or you can exchange
it for common stock of the issuing company at a predetermined ratio. (An
option gives its owner the right to buy or sell another security at a
given price within a specific period of time.) Because they are
exchangeable into stock, convertibles pay lower rates of interest than
most comparable bonds. On the other hand, if a company’s stock price
soars, a convertible bond exchangeable into that stock will perform much
better than a conventional bond. (Conversely, the typical
convertible—with its lower interest rate—will fare worse in a falling
bond market.)1</p>
<p>From 1957 through 2002, according to Ibbotson Associates, convertible
bonds earned an annual average return of 8.3%—only two percentage points
below the total return on stocks, but with steadier prices and shallower
losses.2 More income, less risk than stocks: No wonder Wall Street’s
salespeople often describe convertibles as a “best of both worlds”
investment. But the intelligent investor will quickly realize that
convertibles offer less income and more risk than most other bonds. So
they could, by the same logic and with equal justice, be called a “worst
of both worlds” investment. Which side you come down on depends on how
you use them.</p>
<p>In truth, convertibles act more like stocks than bonds. The return on
convertibles is about 83% correlated to the Standard andandandand Poor’s
500-stock index—but only about 30% correlated to the performance of
Treasury bonds. Thus, “converts” zig when most bonds zag. For
conservative investors with most or all of their assets in bonds, adding
a diversified bundle of converts is a sensible way to seek stock-like
returns without having to take the scary step of investing in stocks
directly. You could call convertible bonds “stocks for chickens.”</p>
<p>As convertibles expert F. Barry Nelson of Advent Capital Management
points out, this roughly 00 billion market has blossomed since Graham’s
day. Most converts are now medium-term, in the seven-to-10-year range;
roughly half are investment-grade; and many issues now carry some call
protection (an assurance against early redemption). All these factors
make them less risky than they used to be.3</p>
<p>It’s expensive to trade small lots of convertible bonds, and
diversification is impractical unless you have well over 00,000 to
invest in this sector alone. Fortunately, today’s intelligent investor
has the convenient recourse of buying a low-cost convertible bond fund.
Fidelity and Vanguard offer mutual funds with annual expenses
comfortably under 1%, while several closed-end funds are also available
at a reasonable cost (and, occasionally, at discounts to net asset
value).4</p>
<p>On Wall Street, cuteness and complexity go hand-in-hand—and
convertibles are no exception. Among the newer varieties are a jumble of
securities with acronymic nicknames like LYONS, ELKS, EYES, PERCS, MIPS,
CHIPS, and YEELDS. These intricate securities put a “floor” under your
potential losses, but also cap your potential profits and often compel
you to convert into common stock on a fixed date. Like most investments
that purport to ensure against loss (see sidebar on p. 421), these
things are generally more trouble than they are worth. You can best
shield yourself against loss not by buying one of these quirky
contraptions, but by intelligently diversifying your entire portfolio
across cash, bonds, and U.S. and foreign stocks.</p>
<p>UNCOVERING COVERED CALLS</p>
<p>As the bear market clawed its way through 2003, it dug up an old fad:
writing covered call options. (A recent Google search on “covered call
writing” turned up more than 2,600 hits.) What are covered calls, and
how do they work? Imagine that you buy 100 shares of Ixnay Corp. at 5
apiece. You then sell (or “write”) a call option on your shares. In
exchange, you get a cash payment known as a “call premium.” (Let’s say
it’s 0 per share.) The buyer of the option, meanwhile, has the
contractual right to buy your Ixnay shares at a mutually agreed-upon
price—say, 00. You get to keep the stock so long as it stays below 00,
and you earn a fat ,000 in premium income, which will cushion the fall
if Ixnay’s stock crashes.</p>
<p>Less risk, more income. What’s not to like?</p>
<p>Well, now imagine that Ixnay’s stock price jumps overnight to 10.
Then your option buyer will exercise his rights, yanking your shares
away for 00 apiece. You’ve still got your ,000 in income, but he’s got
your Ixnay—and the more it goes up, the harder you will kick
yourself.1</p>
<p>Since the potential gain on a stock is unlimited, while no loss can
exceed 100%, the only person you will enrich with this strategy is your
broker. You’ve put a floor under your losses, but you’ve also slapped a
ceiling over your gains. For individual investors, covering your
downside is never worth surrendering most of your upside.</p>
