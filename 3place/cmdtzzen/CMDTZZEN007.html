<h4 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h4>
<p>Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach</p>
<p>The “aggressive” investor should start from the same base as the
defensive investor, namely, a division of his funds between high-grade
bonds and high-grade common stocks bought at reasonable prices.* He will
be prepared to branch out into other kinds of security commitments, but
in each case he will want a well-reasoned justification for the
departure. There is a difficulty in discussing this topic in orderly
fashion, because there is no single or ideal pattern for aggressive
operations. The field of choice is wide; the selection should depend not
only on the individual’s competence and equipment but perhaps equally
well upon his interests and preferences.</p>
<p>The most useful generalizations for the enterprising investor are of
a negative sort. Let him leave high-grade preferred stocks to corporate
buyers. Let him also avoid inferior types of bonds and preferred stocks
unless they can be bought at bargain levels—which means ordinarily at
prices at least 30% under par for high-coupon issues, and much less for
the lower coupons.* He will let someone else buy foreign-government bond
issues, even though the yield may be attractive. He will also be wary of
all kinds of new issues, including convertible bonds and preferreds that
seem quite tempting and common stocks with excellent earnings confined
to the recent past.</p>
<p>For standard bond investments the aggressive investor would do well
to follow the pattern suggested to his defensive confrere, and make his
choice between high-grade taxable issues, which can now be selected to
yield about 7¼%, and good-quality tax-free bonds, which yield up to
5.30% on longer maturities.†</p>
<p>Second-Grade Bonds and Preferred Stocks</p>
<p>Since in late-1971 it is possible to find first-rate corporate bonds
to yield 7¼%, and even more, it would not make much sense to buy
second-grade issues merely for the higher return they offer. In fact
corporations with relatively poor credit standing have found it
virtually impossible to sell “straight bonds”—i.e., nonconvertibles—to
the public in the past two years. Hence their debt financing has been
done by the sale of convertible bonds (or bonds with warrants attached),
which place them in a separate category. It follows that virtually all
the nonconvertible bonds of inferior rating represent older issues which
are selling at a large discount. Thus they offer the possibility of a
substantial gain in principal value under favorable future
conditions—which would mean here a combination of an improved credit
rating for the company and lower general interest rates.</p>
<p>But even in the matter of price discounts and resultant chance of
principal gain, the second-grade bonds are in competition with better
issues. Some of the well-entrenched obligations with “old-style” coupon
rates (2½% to 4%) sold at about 50 cents on the dollar in 1970.
Examples: American Telephone andandandand Telegraph 2 5/8s, due 1986
sold at 51; Atchison Topeka andandandand Santa Fe RR 4s, due 1995, sold
at 51; McGraw-Hill 3 7/8s, due 1992, sold at 50½.</p>
<p>Hence under conditions of late-1971 the enterprising investors can
probably get from good-grade bonds selling at a large discount all that
he should reasonably desire in the form of both income and chance of
appreciation.</p>
<p>Throughout this book we refer to the possibility that any
well-defined and protracted market situation of the past may return in
the future. Hence we should consider what policy the aggressive investor
might have to choose in the bond field if prices and yields of
high-grade issues should return to former normals. For this reason we
shall reprint here our observations on that point made in the 1965
edition, when high-grade bonds yielded only 4½%.</p>
<p>Something should be said now about investing in second-grade issues,
which can readily be found to yield any specified return up to 8% or
more. The main difference between first- and second- grade bonds is
usually found in the number of times the interest charges have been
covered by earnings. Example: In early 1964 Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul
and Pacific 5% income debenture bonds, at 68, yielded 7.35%. But the
total interest charges of the road, before income taxes, were earned
only 1.5 times in 1963, against our requirement of 5 times for a
well-protected railroad issue.1</p>
<p>Many investors buy securities of this kind because they “need income”
and cannot get along with the meager return offered by top-grade issues.
Experience clearly shows that it is unwise to buy a bond or a preferred
which lacks adequate safety merely because the yield is attractive.*
(Here the word “merely” implies that the issue is not selling at a large
discount and thus does not offer an opportunity for a substantial gain
in principal value.) Where such securities are bought at full
prices—that is, not many points under 100 * —the chances are very great
that at some future time the holder will see much lower quotations. For
when bad business comes, or just a bad market, issues of this kind prove
highly susceptible to severe sinking spells; often interest or dividends
are suspended or at least endangered, and frequently there is a
pronounced price weakness even though the operating results are not at
all bad.</p>
<p>As a specific illustration of this characteristic of second-quality
senior issues, let us summarize the price behavior of a group of ten
railroad income bonds in 1946–47. These comprise all of those which sold
at 96 or more in 1946, their high prices averaging 102½. By the
following year the group had registered low prices averaging only 68, a
loss of one-third of the market value in a very short time. Peculiarly
enough, the railroads of the country were showing much better earnings
in 1947 than in 1946; hence the drastic price decline ran counter to the
business picture and was a reflection of the selloff in the general
market. But it should be pointed out that the shrinkage in these income
bonds was proportionately larger than that in the common stocks in the
Dow Jones industrial list (about 23%). Obviously the purchaser of these
bonds at a cost above 100 could not have expected to participate to any
extent in a further rise in the securities market. The only attractive
feature was the income yield, averaging about 4.25% (against 2.50% for
first-grade bonds, an advantage of 1.75% in annual income). Yet the
sequel showed all too soon and too plainly that for the minor advantage
in annual income the buyer of these second-grade bonds was risking the
loss of a substantial part of his principal.</p>
<p>The above example permits us to pay our respects to the popular
fallacy that goes under the sobriquet of a “businessman’s investment.”
That involves the purchase of a security showing a larger yield than is
obtainable on a high-grade issue and carrying a correspondingly greater
risk. It is bad business to accept an acknowledged possibility of a loss
of principal in exchange for a mere 1 or 2% of additional yearly income.
If you are willing to assume some risk you should be certain that you
can realize a really substantial gain in principal value if things go
well. Hence a second-grade 5.5 or 6% bond selling at par is almost
always a bad purchase. The same issue at 70 might make more sense—and if
you are patient you will probably be able to buy it at that level.</p>
<p>Second-grade bonds and preferred stocks possess two contradictory
attributes which the intelligent investor must bear clearly in mind.
Nearly all suffer severe sinking spells in bad markets. On the other
hand, a large proportion recover their position when favorable
conditions return, and these ultimately “work out all right.” This is
true even of (cumulative) preferred stocks that fail to pay dividends
for many years. There were a number of such issues in the early 1940s,
as a consequence of the long depression of the 1930s. During the postwar
boom period of 1945–1947 many of these large accumulations were paid off
either in cash or in new securities, and the principal was often
discharged as well. As a result, large profits were made by people who,
a few years previously, had bought these issues when they were
friendless and sold at low prices.2</p>
<p>It may well be true that, in an overall accounting, the higher yields
obtainable on second-grade senior issues will prove to have offset those
principal losses that were irrecoverable. In other words, an investor
who bought all such issues at their offering prices might conceivably
fare as well, in the long run, as one who limited himself to
first-quality securities; or even somewhat better.3</p>
<p>But for practical purposes the question is largely irrelevant.
Regardless of the outcome, the buyer of second-grade issues at full
prices will be worried and discommoded when their price declines
precipitately. Furthermore, he cannot buy enough issues to assure an
“average” result, nor is he in a position to set aside a portion of his
larger income to offset or “amortize” those principal losses which prove
to be permanent. Finally, it is mere common sense to abstain from buying
securities at around 100 if long experience indicates that they can
probably be bought at 70 or less in the next weak market.</p>
<p>Foreign Government Bonds</p>
<p>All investors with even small experience know that foreign bonds, as
a whole, have had a bad investment history since 1914. This was
inevitable in the light of two world wars and an intervening world
depression of unexampled depth. Yet every few years market conditions
are sufficiently favorable to permit the sale of some new foreign issues
at a price of about par. This phenomenon tells us a good deal about the
working of the average investor’s mind—and not only in the field of
bonds.</p>
<p>We have no concrete reason to be concerned about the future history
of well-regarded foreign bonds such as those of Australia or Norway. But
we do know that, if and when trouble should come, the owner of foreign
obligations has no legal or other means of enforcing his claim. Those
who bought Republic of Cuba 4½s as high as 117 in 1953 saw them default
their interest and then sell as low as 20 cents on the dollar in 1963.
The New York Stock Exchange bond list in that year also included Belgian
Congo 5¼s at 36, Greek 7s at 30, and various issues of Poland as low as
7. How many readers have any idea of the repeated vicissitudes of the 8%
bonds of Czechoslovakia, since they were first offered in this country
in 1922 at 96½? They advanced to 112 in 1928, declined to 67 3/4 in
1932, recovered to 106 in 1936, collapsed to 6 in 1939, recovered
(unbelievably) to 117 in 1946, fell promptly to 35 in 1948, and sold as
low as 8 in 1970!</p>
<p>Years ago an argument of sorts was made for the purchase of foreign
bonds here on the grounds that a rich creditor nation such as ours was
under moral obligation to lend abroad. Time, which brings so many
revenges, now finds us dealing with an intractable balance-of-payments
problem of our own, part of which is ascribable to the large-scale
purchase of foreign bonds by American investors seeking a small
advantage in yield. For many years past we have questioned the inherent
attractiveness of such investments from the standpoint of the buyer;
perhaps we should add now that the latter would benefit both his country
and himself if he declined these opportunities.</p>
<p>New Issues Generally</p>
<p>It might seem ill-advised to attempt any broad statements about new
issues as a class, since they cover the widest possible range of quality
and attractiveness. Certainly there will be exceptions to any suggested
rule. Our one recommendation is that all investors should be wary of new
issues—which means, simply, that these should be subjected to careful
examination and unusually severe tests before they are purchased.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for this double caveat. The first is that new
issues have special salesmanship behind them, which calls therefore for
a special degree of sales resistance.* The second is that most new
issues are sold under “favorable market conditions”—which means
favorable for the seller and consequently less favorable for the
buyer.†</p>
<p>The effect of these considerations becomes steadily more important as
we go down the scale from the highest-quality bonds through second-grade
senior issues to common-stock flotations at the bottom. A tremendous
amount of financing, consisting of the repayment of existing bonds at
call price and their replacement by new issues with lower coupons, was
done in the past. Most of this was in the category of high-grade bonds
and preferred stocks. The buyers were largely financial institutions,
amply qualified to protect their interests. Hence these offerings were
carefully priced to meet the going rate for comparable issues, and
high-powered salesmanship had little effect on the outcome. As interest
rates fell lower and lower the buyers finally came to pay too high a
price for these issues, and many of them later declined appreciably in
the market. This is one aspect of the general tendency to sell new
securities of all types when conditions are most favorable to the
issuer; but in the case of first-quality issues the ill effects to the
purchaser are likely to be unpleasant rather than serious.</p>
<p>The situation proves somewhat different when we study the lower-grade
bonds and preferred stocks sold during the 1945–46 and 1960–61 periods.
Here the effect of the selling effort is more apparent, because most of
these issues were probably placed with individual and inexpert
investors. It was characteristic of these offerings that they did not
make an adequate showing when judged by the performance of the companies
over a sufficient number of years. They did look safe enough, for the
most part, if it could be assumed that the recent earnings would
continue without a serious setback. The investment bankers who brought
out these issues presumably accepted this assumption, and their salesmen
had little difficulty in persuading themselves and their customers to a
like effect. Nevertheless it was an unsound approach to investment, and
one likely to prove costly.</p>
<p>Bull-market periods are usually characterized by the transformation
of a large number of privately owned businesses into companies with
quoted shares. This was the case in 1945–46 and again beginning in 1960.
The process then reached extraordinary proportions until brought to a
catastrophic close in May 1962. After the usual “swearing-off” period of
several years the whole tragicomedy was repeated, step by step, in
1967–1969.*</p>
<p>New Common-Stock Offerings</p>
<p>The following paragraphs are reproduced unchanged from the 1959
edition, with comment added:</p>
<p>Common-stock financing takes two different forms. In the case of
companies already listed, additional shares are offered pro rata to the
existing stockholders. The subscription price is set below the current
market, and the “rights” to subscribe have an initial money value.* The
sale of the new shares is almost always under-written by one or more
investment banking houses, but it is the general hope and expectation
that all the new shares will be taken by the exercise of the
subscription rights. Thus the sale of additional common stock of listed
companies does not ordinarily call for active selling effort on the part
of distributing firms.</p>
<p>The second type is the placement with the public of common stock of
what were formerly privately owned enterprises. Most of this stock is
sold for the account of the controlling interests to enable them to cash
in on a favorable market and to diversify their own finances. (When new
money is raised for the business it comes often via the sale of
preferred stock, as previously noted.) This activity follows a
well-defined pattern, which by the nature of the security markets must
bring many losses and disappointments to the public. The dangers arise
both from the character of the businesses that are thus financed and
from the market conditions that make the financing possible.</p>
<p>In the early part of the century a large proportion of our leading
companies were introduced to public trading. As time went on, the number
of enterprises of first rank that remained closely held steadily
diminished; hence original common-stock flotations have tended to be
concentrated more and more on relatively small concerns. By an
unfortunate correlation, during the same period the stock-buying public
has been developing an ingrained preference for the major companies and
a similar prejudice against the minor ones. This prejudice, like many
others, tends to become weaker as bull markets are built up; the large
and quick profits shown by common stocks as a whole are sufficient to
dull the public’s critical faculty, just as they sharpen its acquisitive
instinct. During these periods, also, quite a number of privately owned
concerns can be found that are enjoying excellent results—although most
of these would not present too impressive a record if the figures were
carried back, say, ten years or more.</p>
<p>When these factors are put together the following consequences
emerge: Somewhere in the middle of the bull market the first
common-stock flotations make their appearance. These are priced not
unattractively, and some large profits are made by the buyers of the
early issues. As the market rise continues, this brand of financing
grows more frequent; the quality of the companies becomes steadily
poorer; the prices asked and obtained verge on the exorbitant. One
fairly dependable sign of the approaching end of a bull swing is the
fact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies are
offered at prices somewhat higher than the current level for many
medium-sized companies with a long market history. (It should be added
that very little of this common-stock financing is ordinarily done by
banking houses of prime size and reputation.)*</p>
<p>The heedlessness of the public and the willingness of selling
organizations to sell whatever may be profitably sold can have only one
result—price collapse. In many cases the new issues lose 75% and more of
their offering price. The situation is worsened by the aforementioned
fact that, at bottom, the public has a real aversion to the very kind of
small issue that it bought so readily in its careless moments. Many of
these issues fall, proportionately, as much below their true value as
they formerly sold above it.</p>
<p>An elementary requirement for the intelligent investor is an ability
to resist the blandishments of salesmen offering new common-stock issues
during bull markets. Even if one or two can be found that can pass
severe tests of quality and value, it is probably bad policy to get
mixed up in this sort of business. Of course the salesman will point to
many such issues which have had good-sized market advances—including
some that go up spectacularly the very day they are sold. But all this
is part of the speculative atmosphere. It is easy money. For every
dollar you make in this way you will be lucky if you end up by losing
only two.</p>
<p>Some of these issues may prove excellent buys—a few years later, when
nobody wants them and they can be had at a small fraction of their true
worth.</p>
<p>In the 1965 edition we continued our discussion of this subject as
follows:</p>
<p>While the broader aspects of the stock market’s behavior since 1949
have not lent themselves well to analysis based on long experience, the
development of new common-stock flotations proceeded exactly in
accordance with ancient prescription. It is doubtful whether we ever
before had so many new issues offered, of such low quality, and with
such extreme price collapses, as we experienced in 1960–1962.4 The
ability of the stock market as a whole to disengage itself rapidly from
that disaster is indeed an extraordinary phenomenon, bringing back
long-buried memories of the similar invulnerability it showed to the
great Florida real-estate collapse in 1925.</p>
<p>Must there be a return of the new-stock-offering madness before the
present bull market can come to its definitive close? Who knows? But we
do know that an intelligent investor will not forget what happened in
1962 and will let others make the next batch of quick profits in this
area and experience the consequent harrowing losses.</p>
<p>We followed these paragraphs in the 1965 edition by citing “A
Horrible Example,” namely, the sale of stock of Aetna Maintenance Co. at
in November 1961. In typical fashion the shares promptly advanced to 5;
the next year they fell to 2 3/8, and in 1964 to 7/8. The later history
of this company was on the extraordinary side, and illustrates some of
the strange metamorphoses that have taken place in American business,
great and small, in recent years. The curious reader will find the older
and newer history of this enterprise in Appendix 5.</p>
<p>It is by no means difficult to provide even more harrowing examples
taken from the more recent version of “the same old story,” which
covered the years 1967–1970. Nothing could be more pat to our purpose
than the case of AAA Enterprises, which happens to be the first company
then listed in Standard andandandand Poor’s Stock Guide. The shares were
sold to the public at 4 in 1968, promptly advanced to 28, but in early
1971 were quoted at a dismal 25¢. (Even this price represented a gross
overvaluation of the enterprise, since it had just entered the
bankruptcy court in a hopeless condition.) There is so much to be
learned, and such important warnings to be gleaned, from the story of
this flotation that we have reserved it for detailed treatment below, in
Chapter 17.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 6</p>
<p>The punches you miss are the ones that wear you out.</p>
<p>—Boxing trainer Angelo Dundee</p>
<p>For the aggressive as well as the defensive investor, what you don’t
do is as important to your success as what you do. In this chapter,
Graham lists his “don’ts” for aggressive investors. Here is a list for
today.</p>
<p>Junkyard Dogs?</p>
<p>High-yield bonds—which Graham calls “second-grade” or “lower-grade”
and today are called “junk bonds”—get a brisk thumbs-down from Graham.
In his day, it was too costly and cumbersome for an individual investor
to diversify away the risks of default.;1 (To learn how bad a default
can be, and how carelessly even “sophisticated” professional bond
investors can buy into one, see the sidebar on p. 146.) Today, however,
more than 130 mutual funds specialize in junk bonds. These funds buy
junk by the cartload; they hold dozens of different bonds. That
mitigates Graham’s complaints about the difficulty of diversifying.
(However, his bias against high-yield preferred stock remains valid,
since there remains no cheap and widely available way to spread their
risks.)</p>
<p>Since 1978, an annual average of 4.4% of the junk-bond market has
gone into default—but, even after those defaults, junk bonds have still
produced an annualized return of 10.5%, versus 8.6% for 10-year U.S.
Treasury bonds.2 Unfortunately, most junk-bond funds charge high fees
and do a poor job of preserving the original principal amount of your
investment. A junk fund could be appropriate if you are retired, are
looking for extra monthly income to supplement your pension, and can
tolerate temporary tumbles in value. If you work at a bank or other
financial company, a sharp rise in interest rates could limit your raise
or even threaten your job security—so a junk fund, which tends to
outper-forms most other bond funds when interest rates rise, might make
sense as a counterweight in your 401(k). A junk-bond fund, though, is
only a minor option—not an obligation—for the intelligent investor.</p>
<p>A WORLD OF HURT FOR WORLDCOM BONDS</p>
<p>Buying a bond only for its yield is like getting married only for the
sex. If the thing that attracted you in the first place dries up, you’ll
find yourself asking, “What else is there?” When the answer is
“Nothing,” spouses and bondholders alike end up with broken hearts.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2001, WorldCom, Inc. sold the biggest offering of bonds in
U.S. corporate history—1.9 billion worth. Among the eager beavers
attracted by the yields of up to 8.3% were the California Public
Employees’ Retirement System, one of the world’s largest pension funds;
Retirement Systems of Alabama, whose managers later explained that “the
higher yields” were “very attractive to us at the time they were
purchased”; and the Strong Corporate Bond Fund, whose comanager was so
fond of WorldCom’s fat yield that he boasted, “we’re getting paid more
than enough extra income for the risk.” 1</p>
<p>But even a 30-second glance at WorldCom’s bond prospectus would have
shown that these bonds had nothing to offer but their yield—and
everything to lose. In two of the previous five years WorldCom’s pretax
income (the company’s profits before it paid its dues to the IRS) fell
short of covering its fixed charges (the costs of paying interest to its
bondholders) by a stupendous .1 billion. WorldCom could cover those bond
payments only by borrowing more money from banks. And now, with this
mountainous new helping of bonds, WorldCom was fattening its interest
costs by another 00 million per year!2 Like Mr. Creosote in Monty
Python’s The Meaning of Life, WorldCom was gorging itself to the
bursting point.</p>
<p>No yield could ever be high enough to compensate an investor for
risking that kind of explosion. The WorldCom bonds did produce fat
yields of up to 8% for a few months. Then, as Graham would have
predicted, the yield suddenly offered no shelter:</p>
<p>WorldCom filed bankruptcy in July 2002.</p>
<p>WorldCom admitted in August 2002 that it had overstated its earnings
by more than billion.3</p>
<p>WorldCom’s bonds defaulted when the company could no longer cover
their interest charges; the bonds lost more than 80% of their original
value.</p>
<p>The Vodka-and-Burrito Portfolio</p>
<p>Graham considered foreign bonds no better a bet than junk
bonds.3Today, however, one variety of foreign bond may have some appeal
for investors who can withstand plenty of risk. Roughly a dozen mutual
funds specialize in bonds issued in emerging-market nations (or what
used to be called “Third World countries”) like Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russia, and Venezuela. No sane investor would put more than 10% of a
total bond portfolio in spicy holdings like these. But emerging-markets
bond funds seldom move in synch with the U.S. stock market, so they are
one of the rare investments that are unlikely to drop merely because the
Dow is down. That can give you a small corner of comfort in your
portfolio just when you may need it most.4</p>
<p>Dying a Trader’s Death</p>
<p>As we’ve already seen in Chapter 1, day trading—holding stocks for a
few hours at a time—is one of the best weapons ever invented for
committing financial suicide. Some of your trades might make money, most
of your trades will lose money, but your broker will always make
money.</p>
<p>And your own eagerness to buy or sell a stock can lower your return.
Someone who is desperate to buy a stock can easily end up having to bid
10 cents higher than the most recent share price before any sellers will
be willing to part with it. That extra cost, called “market impact,”
never shows up on your brokerage statement, but it’s real. If you’re
overeager to buy 1,000 shares of a stock and you drive its price up by
just five cents, you’ve just cost yourself an invisible but very real 0.
On the flip side, when panicky investors are frantic to sell a stock and
they dump it for less than the most recent price, market impact hits
home again.</p>
<p>The costs of trading wear away your returns like so many swipes of
sandpaper. Buying or selling a hot little stock can cost 2% to 4% (or 4%
to 8% for a “round-trip” buy-and-sell transaction).5 If you put ,000
into a stock, your trading costs could eat up roughly 0 before you even
get started. Sell the stock, and you could fork over another 4% in
trading expenses.</p>
<p>Oh, yes—there’s one other thing. When you trade instead of invest,
you turn long-term gains (taxed at a maximum capital-gains rate of 20%)
into ordinary income (taxed at a maximum rate of 38.6%).</p>
<p>Add it all up, and a stock trader needs to gain at least 10% just to
break even on buying and selling a stock.6 Anyone can do that once, by
luck alone. To do it often enough to justify the obsessive attention it
requires—plus the nightmarish stress it generates—is impossible.</p>
<p>Thousands of people have tried, and the evidence is clear: The more
you trade, the less you keep.</p>
<p>Finance professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of the University
of California examined the trading records of more than 66,000 customers
of a major discount brokerage firm. From 1991 through 1996, these
clients made more than 1.9 million trades. Before the costs of trading
sandpapered away at their returns, the people in the study actually
outperformed the market by an average of at least half a percentage
point per year. But after trading costs, the most active of these
traders—who shifted more than 20% of their stock holdings per month—went
from beating the market to underperforming it by an abysmal 6.4
percentage points per year. The most patient investors, however—who
traded a minuscule 0.2% of their total holdings in an average
month—managed to outper-forms the market by a whisker, even after their
trading costs. Instead of giving a huge hunk of their gains away to
their brokers and the IRS, they got to keep almost everything.7 For a
look at these results, see Figure 6-1.</p>
<p>The lesson is clear: Don’t just do something, stand there. It’s time
for everyone to acknowledge that the term “long-term investor” is
redundant. A long-term investor is the only kind of investor there is.
Someone who can’t hold on to stocks for more than a few months at a time
is doomed to end up not as a victor but as a victim.</p>
<p>The Early Bird Gets Wormed</p>
<p>Among the get-rich-quick toxins that poisoned the mind of the
investing public in the 1990s, one of the most lethal was the idea that
you can build wealth by buying IPOs. An IPO is an “initial public
offering,” or the first sale of a company’s stock to the public. At
first blush, investing in IPOs sounds like a great idea—after all, if
you’d bought 100 shares of Microsoft when it went public on March 13,
1986, your ,100 investment would have grown to 20,000 by early 2003.8And
finance professors Jay Ritter and William Schwert have shown that if you
had spread a total of only ,000 across every IPO in January 1960, at its
offering price, sold out at the end of that month, then invested anew in
each successive month’s crop of IPOs, your portfolio would have been
worth more than 33 decillion by year-end 2001.</p>
<p>(On the printed page, that looks like this:
33,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.)</p>
<p>FIGURE 6-1</p>
<p>The Faster You Run, the Behinder You Get</p>
<p>Researchers Brad Barber and Terrance Odean divided thousands of
traders into five tiers based on how often they turned over their
holdings. Those who traded the least (at the left) kept most of their
gains. But the impatient and hyperactive traders made their brokers
rich, not themselves. (The bars at the far right show a market index
fund for comparison.)</p>
<p>Source: Profs. Brad Barber, University of California at Davis, and
Terrance Odean, University of California at Berkeley</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for every IPO like Microsoft that turns out to be a
big winner, there are thousands of losers. The psychologists Daniel
Kahnerman and Amos Tversky have shown when humans estimate the
likelihood or frequency of an event, we make that judgment based not on
how often the event has actually occurred, but on how vivid the past
examples are. We all want to buy “the next Microsoft”—precisely because
we know we missed buying the first Microsoft. But we conveniently
overlook the fact that most other IPOs were terrible investments. You
could have earned that 33 decillion gain only if you never missed a
single one of the IPO market’s rare winners—a practical impossibility.
Finally, most of the high returns on IPOs are captured by members of an
exclusive private club—the big investment banks and fund houses that get
shares at the initial (or “underwriting”) price, before the stock begins
public trading. The biggest “run-ups” often occur in stocks so small
that even many big investors can’t get any shares; there just aren’t
enough to go around.</p>
<p>If, like nearly every investor, you can get access to IPOs only after
their shares have rocketed above the exclusive initial price, your
results will be terrible. From 1980 through 2001, if you had bought the
average IPO at its first public closing price and held on for three
years, you would have underperformed the market by more than 23
percentage points annually.9</p>
<p>Perhaps no stock personifies the pipe dream of getting rich from IPOs
better than VA Linux. “LNUX THE NEXT MSFT,” exulted an early owner; “BUY
NOW, AND RETIRE IN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW.”10 On December 9, 1999, the
stock was placed at an initial public offering price of 0. But demand
for the shares was so ferocious that when NASDAQ opened that morning,
none of the initial owners of VA Linux would let go of any shares until
the price hit 99. The stock peaked at 20 and closed at 39.25, a gain of
697.5% in a single day. But that gain was earned by only a handful of
institutional traders; individual investors were almost entirely frozen
out.</p>
<p>More important, buying IPOs is a bad idea because it flagrantly
violates one of Graham’s most fundamental rules: No matter how many
other people want to buy a stock, you should buy only if the stock is a
cheap way to own a desirable business. At the peak price on day one,
investors were valuing VA Linux’s shares at a total of 2.7 billion. What
was the company’s business worth? Less than five years old, VA Linux had
sold a cumulative total of 4 million worth of its software and
services—but had lost 5 million in the process. In its most recent
fiscal quarter, VA Linux had generated 5 million in sales but had lost 0
million on them. This business, then, was losing almost 70 cents on
every dollar it took in. VA Linux’s accumulated deficit (the amount by
which its total expenses had exceeded its income) was 0 million.</p>
<p>If VA Linux were a private company owned by the guy who lives next
door, and he leaned over the picket fence and asked you how much you
would pay to take his struggling little business off his hands, would
you answer, “Oh, 2.7 billion sounds about right to me”? Or would you,
instead, smile politely, turn back to your barbecue grill, and wonder
what on earth your neighbor had been smoking? Relying exclusively on our
own judgment, none of us would be caught dead agreeing to pay nearly 3
billion for a money-loser that was already 0 million in the hole.</p>
<p>But when we’re in public instead of in private, when valuation
suddenly becomes a popularity contest, the price of a stock seems more
important than the value of the business it represents. As long as
someone else will pay even more than you did for a stock, why does it
matter what the business is worth?</p>
<p>This chart shows why it matters.</p>
<p>FIGURE 6-2</p>
<p>The Legend of VA Linux</p>
<p>After going up like a bottle rocket on that first day of trading, VA
Linux came down like a buttered brick. By December 9, 2002, three years
to the day after the stock was at 39.50, VA Linux closed at .19 per
share.</p>
<p>Weighing the evidence objectively, the intelligent investor should
conclude that IPO does not stand only for “initial public offering.”
More accurately, it is also shorthand for:</p>
<p>It’s Probably Overpriced,</p>
<p>Imaginary Profits Only,</p>
<p>Insiders’ Private Opportunity, or</p>
<p>Idiotic, Preposterous, and Outrageous.</p>
