<h4 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h4>
<p>A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies</p>
<p>In this chapter we shall attempt a novel form of exposition. By
selecting eight pairs of companies which appear next to each other, or
nearly so, on the stock-exchange list we hope to bring home in a
concrete and vivid manner some of the many varieties of character,
financial structure, policies, performance, and vicissitudes of
corporate enterprises, and of the investment and speculative attitudes
found on the financial scene in recent years. In each comparison we
shall comment only on those aspects that have a special meaning and
import.</p>
<p>Pair I: Real Estate Investment Trust (Stores, Offices, Factories,
etc.) and Realty Equities Corp. of New York (Real Estate Investment;
General Construction)</p>
<p>In this first comparison we depart from the alphabetical order used
for the other pairs. It has a special significance for us, since it
seems to encapsulate, on the one hand, all that has been reasonable,
stable, and generally good in the traditional methods of handling other
people’s money, in contrast—in the other company—with the reckless
expansion, the financial legerdemain, and the roller-coaster changes so
often found in present-day corporate operations. The two enterprises
have similar names, and for many years they appeared side by side on the
American Stock Exchange list. Their stock-ticker symbols—REI and
REC—could easily have been confused. But one of them is a staid New
England trust, administered by three trustees, with operations dating
back nearly a century, and with dividends paid continuously since 1889.
It has kept throughout to the same type of prudent investments, limiting
its expansion to a moderate rate and its debt to an easily manageable
figure.*</p>
<p>The other is a typical New York-based sudden-growth venture, which in
eight years blew up its assets from .2 million to 54 million, and its
debts in the same proportion; which moved out from ordinary real-estate
operations to a miscellany of ventures, including two racetracks, 74
movie theaters, three literary agencies, a public-relations firm,
hotels, supermarkets, and a 26% interest in a large cosmetics firm
(which went bankrupt in 1970).† This conglomeration of business ventures
was matched by a corresponding variety of corporate devices, including
the following:</p>
<p>A preferred stock entitled to annual dividends, but with a par value
of only , and carried as a liability at per share.</p>
<p>A stated common-stock value of ,500,000 ( per share), more than
offset by a deduction of ,500,000 as the cost of 209,000 shares of
reacquired stock.</p>
<p>Three series of stock-option warrants, giving rights to buy a total
of 1,578,000 shares.</p>
<p>At least six different kinds of debt obligations, in the form of
mortgages, debentures, publicly held notes, notes payable to banks,
“notes, loans, and contracts payable,” and loans payable to the Small
Business Administration, adding up to over 00 million in March 1969. In
addition it had the usual taxes and accounts payable.</p>
<p>Let us present first a few figures of the two enterprises as they
appeared in 1960 (Table 18-1A). Here we find the Trust shares selling in
the market for nine times the aggregate value of Equities stock. The
Trust enterprise had a smaller relative debt and a better ratio of net
to gross, but the price of the common was higher in relation to
per-share earnings.</p>
<p>TABLE 18-1A. Pair 1. Real Estate Investment Trust vs. Realty Equities
Corp. in 1960</p>
<p>In Table 18-1B we present the situation about eight years later. The
Trust had “kept the noiseless tenor of its way,” increasing both its
revenues and its per-share earnings by about three-quarters.* But Realty
Equities had been metamorphosed into something monstrous and
vulnerable.</p>
<p>How did Wall Street react to these diverse developments? By paying as
little attention as possible to the Trust and a lot to Realty Equities.
In 1968 the latter shot up from 10 to 37 3/4 and the listed warrants
from 6 to 36½, on combined sales of 2,420,000 shares. While this was
happening the Trust shares advanced sedately from 20 to 30¼ on modest
volume. The March 1969 balance sheet of Equities was to show an asset
value of only .41 per share, less than a tenth of its high price that
year. The book value of the Trust shares was 0.85.</p>
<p>TABLE 18-1B. Pair 1.</p>
<p>The next year it became clear that all was not well in the Equities
picture, and the price fell to 9½. When the report for March 1970
appeared the shareholders must have felt shell-shocked as they read that
the enterprise had sustained a net loss of 3,200,000, or .17 per
share—virtually wiping out their former slim equity. (This disastrous
figure included a reserve of ,800,000 for future losses on investments.)
Nonetheless the directors had bravely (?) declared an extra dividend of
5 cents right after the close of the fiscal year. But more trouble was
in sight. The company’s auditors refused to certify the financial
statements for 1969–70, and the shares were suspended from trading on
the American Stock Exchange. In the over-the-counter market the bid
price dropped below per share.*</p>
<p>Real Estate Investment Trust shares had typical price fluctuations
after 1969. The low in 1970 was 16½, with a recovery to 26 5/6 in early
1971. The latest reported earnings were .50 per share, and the stock was
selling moderately above its 1970 book value of 1.60. The issue may have
been somewhat overpriced at its record high in 1968, but the
shareholders have been honestly and well served by their trustees. The
Real Estate Equities story is a different and a sorry one.</p>
<p>Pair 2: Air Products and Chemicals (Industrial and Medical Gases,
etc.) and Air Reduction Co. (Industrial Gases and Equipment;
Chemicals)</p>
<p>Even more than our first pair, these two resemble each other in both
name and line of business. The comparison they invite is thus of the
conventional type in security analysis, while most of our other pairs
are more heteroclite in nature.† “Products” is a newer company than
“Reduction,” and in 1969 had less than half the other’s volume.*
Nonetheless its equity issues sold for 25% more in the aggregate than
Air Reduction’s stock. As Table 18-2 shows, the reason can be found both
in Air Reduction’s greater profitability and in its stronger growth
record. We find here the typical consequences of a better showing of
“quality.” Air Products sold at 16½ times its latest earnings against
only 9.1 times for Air Reduction. Also Air Products sold well above its
asset backing, while Air Reduction could be bought at only 75% of its
book value.† Air Reduction paid a more liberal dividend; but this may be
deemed to reflect the greater desirability for Air Products to retain
its earnings. Also, Air Reduction had a more comfortable working-capital
position. (On this point we may remark that a profitable company can
always put its current position in shape by some form of permanent
financing. But by our standards Air Products was somewhat
overbonded.)</p>
<p>If the analyst were called on to choose between the two companies he
would have no difficulty in concluding that the prospects of Air
Products looked more promising than those of Air Reduction. But did this
make Air Products more attractive at its considerably higher relative
price? We doubt whether this question can be answered in a definitive
fashion. In general Wall Street sets “quality” above “quantity” in its
thinking, and probably the majority of security analysts would opt for
the “better” but dearer Air Products as against the “poorer” but cheaper
Air Reduction. Whether this preference is to prove right or wrong is
more likely to depend on the unpredictable future than on any
demonstrable investment principle. In this instance, Air Reduction
appears to belong to the group of important companies in the
low-multiplier class. If, as the studies referred to above†† would seem
to indicate, that group as a whole is likely to give a better account of
itself than the high-multiplier stocks, then Air Reduction should
logically be given the preference—but only as part of a diversified
operation. (Also, a thorough-going study of the individual companies
could lead the analyst to the opposite conclusion; but that would have
to be for reasons beyond those already reflected in the past
showing.)</p>
<p>SEQUEL: Air Products stood up better than Air Reduction in the 1970
break, with a decline of 16% against 24%. However, Reduction made a
better comeback in early 1971, rising to 50% above its 1969 close,
against 30% for Products. In this case the low-multiplier issue scored
the advantage—for the time being, at least.*</p>
<p>TABLE 18-2. Pair 2.</p>
<p>Pair 3: American Home Products Co. (drugs, cosmetics, household
products, candy) and American Hospital Supply Co. (distributor and
manufacturer of hospital supplies and equipment)</p>
<p>These were two “billion-dollar good-will” companies at the end of
1969, representing different segments of the rapidly growing and
immensely profitable “health industry.” We shall refer to them as Home
and Hospital, respectively. Selected data on both are presented in Table
18-3. They had the following favorable points in common: excellent
growth, with no setbacks since 1958 (i.e., 100% earnings stability); and
strong financial condition. The growth rate of Hospital up to the end of
1969 was considerably higher than Home’s. On the other hand, Home
enjoyed substantially better profitability on both sales and capital.†
(In fact, the relatively low rate of Hospital’s earnings on its capital
in 1969—only 9.7%—raises the intriguing question whether the business
then was in fact a highly profitable one, despite its remarkable past
growth rate in sales and earnings.)</p>
<p>When comparative price is taken into account, Home offered much more
for the money in terms of current (or past) earnings and dividends. The
very low book value of Home illustrates a basic ambiguity or
contradiction in common-stock analysis. On the one hand, it means that
the company is earning a high return on its capital—which in general is
a sign of strength and prosperity. On the other, it means that the
investor at the current price would be especially vulnerable to any
important adverse change in the company’s earnings situation. Since
Hospital was selling at over four times its book value in 1969, this
cautionary remark must be applied to both companies.</p>
<p>TABLE 18-3. Pair 3.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS: Our clear-cut view would be that both companies were too
“rich” at their current prices to be considered by the investor who
decides to follow our ideas of conservative selection. This does not
mean that the companies were lacking in promise. The trouble is, rather,
that their price contained too much “promise” and not enough actual
performance. For the two enterprises combined, the 1969 price reflected
almost billion of good-will valuation. How many years of excellent
future earnings would it take to “realize” that good-will factor in the
form of dividends or tangible assets?</p>
<p>SHORT-TERM SEQUEL: At the end of 1969 the market evidently thought
more highly of the earnings prospects of Hospital than of Home, since it
gave the former almost twice the multiplier of the latter. As it
happened the favored issue showed a microscopic decline in earnings in
1970, while Home turned in a respectable 8% gain. The market price of
Hospital reacted significantly to this one-year disappointment. It sold
at 32 in February 1971—a loss of about 30% from its 1969 close—while
Home was quoted slightly above its corresponding level.*</p>
<p>Pair 4: H andandandand R Block, Inc. (Income-Tax Service) and Blue
Bell, Inc., (Manufacturers of Work Clothes, Uniforms, etc.)</p>
<p>These companies rub shoulders as relative newcomers to the New York
Stock Exchange, where they represent two very different genres of
success stories. Blue Bell came up the hard way in a highly competitive
industry, in which eventually it became the largest factor. Its earnings
have fluctuated somewhat with industry conditions, but their growth
since 1965 has been impressive. The company’s operations go back to 1916
and its continuous dividend record to 1923. At the end of 1969 the stock
market showed no enthusiasm for the issue, giving it a price/earnings
ratio of only 11, against about 17 for the S andandandand P composite
index.</p>
<p>By contrast, the rise of H andandandand R Block has been meteoric.
Its first published figures date only to 1961, in which year it earned
3,000 on revenues of 10,000. But eight years later, on our comparison
date, its revenues had soared to 3.6 million and its net to .3 million.
At that time the stock market’s attitude toward this fine performer
appeared nothing less than ecstatic. The price of 55 at the close of
1969 was more than 100 times the last reported 12-months’ earnings—which
of course were the largest to date. The aggregate market value of 00
million for the stock issue was nearly 30 times the tangible assets
behind the shares.* This was almost unheard of in the annals of serious
stock-market valuations. (At that time IBM was selling at about 9 times
and Xerox at 11 times book value.)</p>
<p>Our Table 18-4 sets forth in dollar figures and in ratios the
extraordinary discrepancy in the comparative valuations of Block and
Blue Bell. True, Block showed twice the profitability of Blue Bell per
dollar of capital, and its percentage growth in earnings over the past
five years (from practically nothing) was much higher. But as a stock
enterprise Blue Bell was selling for less than one-third the total value
of Block, although Blue Bell was doing four times as much business,
earning 2½ times as much for its stock, had 5½ times as much in tangible
investment, and gave nine times the dividend yield on the price.</p>
<p>INDICATED CONCLUSIONS: An experienced analyst would have conceded
great momentum to Block, implying excellent prospects for future growth.
He might have had some qualms about the dangers of serious competition
in the income-tax-service field, lured by the handsome return on capital
realized by Block.1 But mindful of the continued success of such
outstanding companies as Avon Products in highly competitive areas, he
would have hesitated to predict a speedy flattening out of the Block
growth curve. His chief concern would be simply whether the 00 million
valuation for the company had not already fully valued and perhaps
overvalued all that one could reasonably expect from this excellent
business. By contrast the analyst should have had little difficulty in
recommending Blue Bell as a fine company, quite conservatively
priced.</p>
<p>TABLE 18-4. Pair 4.</p>
<p>SEQUEL TO MARCH 1971. The 1970 near-panic lopped one-quarter off the
price of Blue Bell and about one-third from that of Block. Both then
joined in the extraordinary recovery of the general market. The price of
Block rose to 75 in February 1971, but Blue Bell advanced considerably
more—to the equivalent of 109 (after a three-for-two split). Clearly
Blue Bell proved a better buy than Block as of the end of 1969. But the
fact that Block was able to advance some 35% from that apparently
inflated value indicates how wary analysts and investors must be to sell
good companies short—either by word or deed—no matter how high the
quotation may seem.*</p>
<p>Pair 5: International Flavors andandandand Fragrances (Flavors, etc.,
for Other Businesses) and International Harvester Co. (Truck
Manufacturer, Farm Machinery, Construction Machinery)</p>
<p>This comparison should carry more than one surprise. Everyone knows
of International Harvester, one of the 30 giants in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.† How many of our readers have even heard of
International Flavors andandandand Fragrances, next-door neighbor to
Harvester on the New York Stock Exchange list? Yet, mirabile dictu, IFF
was actually selling at the end of 1969 for a higher aggregate market
value than Harvester—47 million versus 10 million. This is the more
amazing when one reflects that Harvester had 17 times the stock capital
of Flavors and 27 times the annual sales. Infact, only three years
before, the net earnings of Harvester had been larger than the 1969
sales of Flavors! How did these extraordinary disparities develop? The
answer lies in the two magic words: profitability and growth. Flavors
made a remarkable showing in both categories, while Harvester left
everything to be desired.</p>
<p>TABLE 18-5. Pair 5.</p>
<p>The story is told in Table 18-5. Here we find Flavors with a
sensational profit of 14.3% of sales (before income tax the figure was
23%), compared with a mere 2.6% for Harvester. Similarly, Flavors had
earned 19.7% on its stock capital against an inadequate 5.5% earned by
Harvester. In five years the net earnings of Flavors had nearly doubled,
while those of Harvester practically stood still. Between 1969 and 1959
the comparison makes similar reading. These differences in performance
produced a typical stock-market divergence in valuation. Flavors sold in
1969 at 55 times its last reported earnings, and Harvester at only 10.7
times. Correspondingly, Flavors was valued at 10.4 times its book value,
while Harvester was selling at a 41% discount from its net worth.</p>
<p>COMMENT AND CONCLUSIONS: The first thing to remark is that the market
success of Flavors was based entirely on the development of its central
business, and involved none of the corporate wheeling and dealing,
acquisition programs, top-heavy capitalization structures, and other
familiar Wall Street practices of recent years. The company has stuck to
its extremely profitable knitting, and that is virtually its whole
story. The record of Harvester raises an entirely different set of
questions, but these too have nothing to do with “high finance.” Why
have so many great companies become relatively unprofitable even during
many years of general prosperity? What is the advantage of doing more
than ½ billion of business if the enterprise cannot earn enough to
justify the shareholders’ investment? It is not for us to prescribe the
solution of this problem. But we insist that not only management but the
rank and file of shareholders should be conscious that the problem
exists and that it calls for the best brains and the best efforts
possible to deal with it.* From the standpoint of common-stock
selection, neither issue would have met our standards of sound,
reasonably attractive, and moderately priced investment. Flavors was a
typical brilliantly successful but lavishly valued company; Harvester’s
showing was too mediocre to make it really attractive even at its
discount price. (Undoubtedly there were better values available in the
reasonably priced class.)</p>
<p>SEQUEL TO 1971: The low price of Harvester at the end of 1969
protected it from a large further decline in the bad break of 1970. It
lost only 10% more. Flavors proved more vulnerable and declined to 45, a
loss of 30%. In the subsequent recovery both advanced, well above their
1969 close, but Harvester soon fell back to the 25 level.</p>
<p>Pair 6: McGraw Edison (Public Utility and Equipment; Housewares)
McGraw-Hill, Inc. (Books, Films, Instruction Systems; Magazine and
Newspaper Publishers; Information Services)</p>
<p>This pair with so similar names—which at times we shall call Edison
and Hill—are two large and successful enterprises in vastly different
fields. We have chosen December 31, 1968, as the date of our comparison,
developed in Table 18-6. The issues were selling at about the same
price, but because of Hill’s larger capitalization it was valued at
about twice the total figure of the other. This difference should appear
somewhat surprising, since Edison had about 50% higher sales and
one-quarter larger net earnings. As a result, we find that the key
ratio—the multiplier of earnings—was more than twice as great for Hill
as for Edison. This phenomenon seems explicable chiefly by the
persistence of a strong enthusiasm and partiality exhibited by the
market toward shares of book-publishing companies, several of which had
been introduced to public trading in the later 1960s.*</p>
<p>Actually, by the end of 1968 it was evident that this enthusiasm had
been overdone. The Hill shares had sold at 56 in 1967, more than 40
times the just-reported record earnings for 1966. But a small decline
had appeared in 1967 and a further decline in 1968. Thus the current
high multiplier of 35 was being applied to a company that had already
shown two years of receding profits. Nonetheless the stock was still
valued at more than eight times its tangible asset backing, indicating a
good-will component of not far from a billion dollars! Thus the price
seemed to illustrate—in Dr. Johnson’s famous phrase—“The triumph of hope
over experience.”</p>
<p>TABLE 18-6. Pair 6.</p>
<p>By contrast, McGraw Edison seemed quoted at a reasonable price in
relation to the (high) general market level and to the company’s overall
performance and financial position.</p>
<p>SEQUEL TO EARLY 1971: The decline of McGraw-Hill’s earnings continued
through 1969 and 1970, dropping to .02 and then to $.82 per share. In
the May 1970 debacle its price suffered a devastating break to 10—less
than a fifth of the figure two years before. It had a good recovery
thereafter, but the high of 24 in May 1971 was still only 60% of the
1968 closing price. McGraw Edison gave a better account of
itself—declining to 22 in 1970 and recovering fully to 41½ in May
1971.*</p>
<p>McGraw-Hill continues to be a strong and prosperous company. But its
price history exemplifies—as do so many other cases—the speculative
hazards in such stocks created by Wall Street through its undisciplined
waves of optimism and pessimism.</p>
<p>Pair 7: National General Corp. (A Large Conglomerate) and National
Presto Industries (Diverse Electric Appliances, Ordnance)</p>
<p>These two companies invite comparison chiefly because they are so
different. Let us call them “General” and “Presto.” We have selected the
end of 1968 for our study, because the write-offs taken by General in
1969 made the figures for that year too ambiguous. The full flavor of
General’s far-flung activities could not be savored the year before, but
it was already conglomerate enough for anyone’s taste. The condensed
description in the Stock Guide read “Nation-wide theatre chain; motion
picture and TV production, savings and loan assn., book publishing.” To
which could be added, then or later, “insurance, investment banking,
records, music publishing, computerized services, real estate—and 35% of
Performance Systems Inc. (name recently changed from Minnie Pearl’s
Chicken System Inc.).” Presto had also followed a diversification
program, but in comparison with General it was modest indeed. Starting
as the leading maker of pressure cookers, it had branched out into
various other household and electric appliances. Quite differently,
also, it took on a number of ordnance contracts for the U.S.
government.</p>
<p>Our Table 18-7 summarizes the showing of the companies at the end of
1968. The capital structure of Presto was as simple as it could
be—nothing but 1,478,000 shares of common stock, selling in the market
for 8 million. Contrastingly, General had more than twice as many shares
of common, plus an issue of convertible preferred, plus three issues of
stock warrants calling for a huge amount of common, plus a towering
convertible bond issue (just given in exchange for stock of an insurance
company), plus a goodly sum of nonconvertible bonds. All this added up
to a market capitalization of 34 million, not counting an impending
issue of convertible bonds, and 50 million, including such issue.
Despite National General’s enormously greater capitalization, it had
actually done considerably less gross business than Presto in their
fiscal years, and it had shown only 75% of Presto’s net income.</p>
<p>The determination of the true market value of General’s common-stock
capitalization presents an interesting problem for security analysts and
has important implications for anyone interested in the stock on any
basis more serious than outright gambling. The relatively small ½
convertible preferred can be readily taken care of by assuming its
conversion into common, when the latter sells at a suitable market
level. This we have done in Table 18-7. But the warrants require
different treatment. In calculating the “full dilution” basis the
company assumes exercise of all the warrants, and the application of the
proceeds to the retirement of debt, plus use of the balance to buy in
common at the market. These assumptions actually produced virtually no
effect on the earnings per share in calendar 1968—which were reported as
.51 both before and after allowance for dilution. We consider this
treatment illogical and unrealistic. As we see it, the warrants
represent a part of the “common-stock package” and their market value is
part of the “effective market value” of the common-stock part of the
capital. (See our discussion of this point on p. 415 above.) This simple
technique of adding the market price of the warrants to that of the
common has a radical effect on the showing of National General at the
end of 1968, as appears from the calculation in Table 18-7. In fact the
“true market price” of the common stock turns out to be more than twice
the quoted figure. Hence the true multiplier of the 1968 earnings is
more than doubled—to the inherently absurd figure of 69 times. The total
market value of the “common-stock equivalents” then becomes 13 million,
which is over three times the tangible assets shown therefor.</p>
<p>TABLE 18-7. Pair 7.</p>
<p>These figures appear the more anomalous when comparison is made with
those of Presto. One is moved to ask how could Presto possibly be valued
at only 6.9 times its current earnings when the multiplier for General
was nearly 10 times as great. All the ratios of Presto are quite
satisfactory—the growth figure suspiciously so, in fact. By that we mean
that the company was undoubtedly benefiting considerably from its war
work, and the shareholders should be prepared for some falling off in
profits under peacetime conditions. But, on balance, Presto met all the
requirements of a sound and reasonably priced investment, while General
had all the earmarks of a typical “conglomerate” of the late 1960s
vintage, full of corporate gadgets and grandiose gestures, but lacking
in substantial values behind the market quotations.</p>
<p>SEQUEL: General continued its diversification policy in 1969, with
some increase in its debt. But it took a whopping write-off of millions,
chiefly in the value of its investment in the Minnie Pearl Chicken deal.
The final figures showed a loss of 2 million before tax credit and 6.4
million after tax credit. The price of the shares fell to 16½ in 1969
and as low as 9 in 1970 (only 15% of its 1968 high of 60). Earnings for
1970 were reported as .33 per share diluted, and the price recovered to
28½ in 1971. National Presto increased its per-share earnings somewhat
in both 1969 and 1970, marking 10 years of uninterrupted growth of
profits. Nonetheless its price declined to 21½ in the 1970 debacle. This
was an interesting figure, since it was less than four times the last
reported earnings, and less than the net current assets available for
the stock at the time. Late in 1971 we find the price of National Presto
60% higher, at 34, but the ratios are still startling. The enlarged
working capital is still about equal to the current price, which in turn
is only 5½ times the last reported earnings. If the investor could now
find ten such issues, for diversification, he could be confident of
satisfactory results.*</p>
<p>Pair 8: Whiting Corp. (Materials-Handling equipment) and Willcox
andandandand Gibbs (Small Conglomerate)</p>
<p>This pair are close but not touching neighbors on the American Stock
Exchange list. The comparison—set forth in Table 18-8A—makes one wonder
if Wall Street is a rational institution. The company with smaller sales
and earnings, and with half the tangible assets for the common, sold at
about four times the aggregate value of the other. The higher-valued
company was about to report a large loss after special charges; it had
not paid a dividend in thirteen years. The other had a long record of
satisfactory earnings, had paid continuous dividends since 1936, and was
currently returning one of the highest dividend yields in the entire
common-stock list. To indicate more vividly the disparity in the
performance of the two companies we append, in Table 18-8B, the earnings
and price record for 1961–1970.</p>
<p>Table 18-8A. Pair 8.</p>
<p>TABLE 18-8B. Ten-Year Price and Earnings Record of Whiting and
Willcox andandandand Gibbs</p>
<p>The history of the two companies throws an interesting light on the
development of medium-sized businesses in this country, in contrast with
much larger-sized companies that have mainly appeared in these pages.
Whiting was incorporated in 1896, and thus goes back at least 75 years.
It seems to have kept pretty faithfully to its materials-handling
business and has done quite well with it over the decades. Willcox
andandandand Gibbs goes back even farther—to 1866—and was long known in
its industry as a prominent maker of industrial sewing machines. During
the past decade it adopted a policy of diversification in what seems a
rather outlandish form. For on the one hand it has an extraordinarily
large number of subsidiary companies (at least 24), making an
astonishing variety of products, but on the other hand the entire
conglomeration adds up to mighty small potatoes by usual Wall Street
standards.</p>
<p>The earnings developments in Whiting are rather characteristic of our
business concerns. The figures show steady and rather spectacular growth
from 41 cents a share in 1960 to .63 in 1968. But they carried no
assurance that such growth must continue indefinitely. The subsequent
decline to only .77 for the 12 months ended January 1971 may have
reflected nothing more than the slowing down of the general economy. But
the stock price reacted in severe fashion, falling about 60% from its
1968 high (43½) to the close of 1969. Our analysis would indicate that
the shares represented a sound and attractive secondary-issue
investment—suitable for the enterprising investor as part of a group of
such commitments.</p>
<p>SEQUEL: Willcox andandandand Gibbs showed a small operating loss for
1970. Its price declined drastically to a low of 4½, recovering in
typical fashion to 9½ in February 1971. It would be hard to justify that
price statistically. Whiting had a relatively small decline, to 16 3/4
in 1970. (At that price it was selling at just about the current assets
alone available for the shares). Its earnings held at .85 per share to
July 1971. In early 1971 the price advanced to 24½, which seemed
reasonable enough but no longer a “bargain” by our standards.*</p>
<p>General Observations</p>
<p>The issues used in these comparisons were selected with some malice
aforethought, and thus they cannot be said to present a random
cross-section of the common-stock list. Also they are limited to the
industrial section, and the important areas of public utilities,
transportation companies, and financial enterprises do not appear. But
they vary sufficiently in size, lines of business, and qualitative and
quantitative aspects to convey a fair idea of the choices confronting an
investor in common stocks.</p>
<p>The relationship between price and indicated value has also differed
greatly from one case to another. For the most part the companies with
better growth records and higher profitability have sold at higher
multipliers of current earnings—which is logical enough in general.
Whether the specific differentials in price/earnings ratios are
“justified” by the facts—or will be vindicated by future
developments—cannot be answered with confidence. On the other hand we do
have quite a few instances here in which a worthwhile judgment can be
reached. These include virtually all the cases where there has been
great market activity in companies of questionable underlying soundness.
Such stocks not only were speculative—which means inherently risky—but a
good deal of the time they were and are obviously overvalued. Other
issues appeared to be worth more than their price, being affected by the
opposite sort of market attitude—which we might call
“underspeculation”—or by undue pessimism because of a shrinkage in
earnings.</p>
<p>TABLE 18-9. Some Price Fluctuations of Sixteen Common Stocks
(Adjusted for Stock Splits Through 1970)</p>
<p>In Table 18-9 we provide some data on the price fluctuations of the
issues covered in this chapter. Most of them had large declines between
1961 and 1962, as well as from 1969 to 1970. Clearly the investor must
be prepared for this type of adverse market movement in future stock
markets. In Table 18-10 we show year-to-year fluctuations of McGraw-Hill
common stock for the period 1958–1970. It will be noted that in each of
the last 13 years the price either advanced or declined over a range of
at least three to two from one year to the next. (In the case of
National General fluctuations of at least this amplitude both upward and
downward were shown in each two-year period.)</p>
<p>TABLE 18-10. Large Year-to-Year Fluctuations of McGraw-Hill,
1958–1971 a</p>
<p>In studying the stock list for the material in this chapter, we were
impressed once again by the wide difference between the usual objectives
of security analysis and those we deem dependable and rewarding. Most
security analysts try to select the issues that will give the best
account of themselves in the future, in terms chiefly of market action
but considering also the development of earnings. We are frankly
skeptical as to whether this can be done with satisfactory results. Our
preference for the analyst’s work would be rather that he should seek
the exceptional or minority cases in which he can form a reasonably
confident judgment that the price is well below value. He should be able
to do this work with sufficient expertness to produce satisfactory
average results over the years.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 18</p>
<p>The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which
is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the
sun. Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it
hath been already of old time, which was before us.</p>
<p>—Ecclesiastes, I: 9–10.</p>
<p>Let’s update Graham’s classic write-up of eight pairs of companies,
using the same compare-and-contrast technique that he pioneered in his
lectures at Columbia Business School and the New York Institute of
Finance. Bear in mind that these summaries describe these stocks only at
the times specified. The cheap stocks may later become overpriced; the
expensive stocks may turn cheap. At some point in its life, almost every
stock is a bargain; at another time, it will be expensive. Although
there are good and bad companies, there is no such thing as a good
stock; there are only good stock prices, which come and go.</p>
<p>Pair 1: CISCO and SYSCO</p>
<p>On March 27, 2000, Cisco Systems, Inc., became the world’s most
valuable corporation as its stock hit 48 billion in total value. Cisco,
which makes equipment that directs data over the Internet, first sold
its shares to the public only 10 years earlier. Had you bought Cisco’s
stock in the initial offering and kept it, you would have earned a gain
resembling a typographical error made by a madman: 103,697%, or a 217%
average annual return. Over its previous four fiscal quarters, Cisco had
generated 4.9 billion in revenues and .5 billion in earnings. The stock
was trading at 219 times Cisco’s net income, one of the highest
price/earnings ratios ever accorded to a large company.</p>
<p>Then there was Sysco Corp., which supplies food to institutional
kitchens and had been publicly traded for 30 years. Over its last four
quarters, Sysco served up 7.7 billion in revenues—almost 20% more than
Cisco—but “only” 57 million in net income. With a market value of 1.7
billion, Sysco’s shares traded at 26 times earnings, well below the
market’s average P/E ratio of 31.</p>
<p>A word-association game with a typical investor might have gone like
this.</p>
<p>Q: What are the first things that pop into your head when I say Cisco
Systems?</p>
<p>A: The Internet…the industry of the future…great stock…hot stock…Can
I please buy some before it goes up even more?</p>
<p>Q: And what about Sysco Corp.?</p>
<p>A: Delivery trucks…succotash…Sloppy Joes…shepherd’s pie…school
lunches…hospital food…no thanks, I’m not hungry anymore.</p>
<p>It’s well established that people often assign a mental value to
stocks based largely on the emotional imagery that companies evoke.1 But
the intelligent investor always digs deeper. Here’s what a skeptical
look at Cisco and Sysco’s financial statements would have turned up:</p>
<p>Much of Cisco’s growth in revenues and earnings came from
acquisitions. Since September alone, Cisco had ponied up 0.2 billion to
buy 11 other firms. How could so many companies be mashed together so
quickly?2 Also, roughly a third of Cisco’s earnings over the previous
six months came not from its businesses, but from tax breaks on stock
options exercised by its executives and employees. And Cisco had gained
.8 billion selling “investments,” then bought billion more. Was it an
Internet company or a mutual fund? What if those “investments” stopped
going up?</p>
<p>Sysco had also acquired several companies over the same period—but
paid only about 30 million. Stock options for Sysco’s insiders totaled
only 1.5% of shares outstanding, versus 6.9% at Cisco. If insiders
cashed their options, Sysco’s earnings per share would be diluted much
less than Cisco’s. And Sysco had raised its quarterly dividend from nine
cents a share to 10; Cisco paid no dividend.</p>
<p>Finally, as Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel pointed out, no
company as big as Cisco had ever been able to grow fast enough to
justify a price/earnings ratio above 60—let alone a P/E ratio over 200.3
Once a company becomes a giant, its growth must slow down—or it will end
up eating the entire world. The great American satirist Ambrose Bierce
coined the word “incompossible” to describe two things that are
conceivable separately but cannot exist together. A company can be a
giant, or it can deserve a giant P/E ratio, but both together are
incompossible.</p>
<p>The wheels soon came off the Cisco juggernaut. First, in 2001, came a
.2 billion charge to “restructure” some of those acquisitions. Over the
next two years, .3 billion in losses on those “investments” leaked out.
From 2000 through 2002, Cisco’s stock lost three-quarters of its value.
Sysco, meanwhile, kept dishing out profits, and the stock gained 56%
over the same period (see Figure 18-1).</p>
<p>Pair 2: Yahoo! and Yum!</p>
<p>On November 30, 1999, Yahoo! Inc.’s stock closed at 12.75, up 79.6%
since the year began. By December 7, the stock was at 48—a 63.6% gain in
five trading days. Yahoo! kept whooping along through year-end, closing
at 32.687 on December 31. In a single month, the stock had more than
doubled, gaining roughly 8 billion to reach a total market value of 14
billion.4</p>
<p>FIGURE 18-1 Cisco vs. Sysco</p>
<p>Note: Total returns for calendar year; net earnings for fiscal
year.</p>
<p>Source: www.morningstar.com</p>
<p>In the previous four quarters, Yahoo! had racked up 33 million in
revenues and 4.9 million in net income. So Yahoo!’s stock was now priced
at 263 times revenues and 3,264 times earnings. (Remember that a P/E
ratio much above 25 made Graham grimace!)5</p>
<p>Why was Yahoo! screaming upward? After the market closed on November
30, Standard andandandand Poor’s announced that it would add Yahoo! to
its S andandandand P 500 index as of December 7. That would make Yahoo!
a compulsory holding for index funds and other big investors—and that
sudden rise in demand was sure to drive the stock even higher, at least
temporarily. With some 90% of Yahoo!’s stock locked up in the hands of
employees, venture-capital firms, and other restricted holders, just a
fraction of its shares could trade. So thousands of people bought the
stock only because they knew other people would have to buy it—and price
was no object.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yum! went begging. A former division of PepsiCo that runs
thousands of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell eateries,
Yum! had produced billion in revenues over the previous four quarters,
on which it earned 33 million—making it more than 17 times Yahoo!’s
size. Yet Yum!’s stock-market value at year-end 1999 was only .9
billion, or 1/19 of Yahoo!’s capitalization. At that price, Yum!’s stock
was selling at just over nine times its earnings and only 73% of its
revenues.6</p>
<p>As Graham liked to say, in the short run the market is a voting
machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine. Yahoo! won the
short-term popularity contest. But in the end, it’s earnings that
matter—and Yahoo! barely had any. Once the market stopped voting and
started weighing, the scales tipped toward Yum! Its stock rose 25.4%
from 2000 through 2002, while Yahoo!’s lost 92.4% cumulatively:</p>

<p>Pair 3: Commerce One and Capital One</p>
<p>In May 2000, Commerce One, Inc., had been publicly traded only since
the previous July. In its first annual report, the company (which
designs Internet “exchanges” for corporate purchasing departments)
showed assets of just 85 million and reported a net loss of 3 million on
only 4 million in total revenues. The stock of this minuscule company
had risen nearly 900% since its IPO, hitting a total market
capitalization of 5 billion. Was it overpriced? “Yes, we have a big
market cap,” Commerce One’s chief executive, Mark Hoffman, shrugged in
an interview. “But we have a big market to play in. We’re seeing
incredible demand…. Analysts expect us to make 40 million in revenue
this year. And in the past we have exceeded expectations.”</p>
<p>Two things jump out from Hoffman’s answer:</p>
<p>Since Commerce One was already losing on every dollar in sales, if it
quadrupled its revenues (as “analysts expect”), wouldn’t it lose money
even more massively?</p>
<p>How could Commerce One have exceeded expectations “in the past”? What
past?</p>
<p>Asked whether his company would ever turn a profit, Hoffman was
ready: “There is no question we can turn this into a profitable
business. We plan on becoming profitable in the fourth quarter of 2001,
a year analysts see us making over 50 million in revenues.”</p>
<p>There come those analysts again! “I like Commerce One at these levels
because it’s growing faster than Ariba 〔a close competitor whose stock
was also trading at around 400 times revenues〕,” said Jeanette Sing, an
analyst at the Wasserstein Perella investment bank. “If these growth
rates continue, Commerce One will be trading at 60 to 70 times sales in
2001.” (In other words, I can name a stock that’s more overpriced than
Commerce One, so Commerce One is cheap.)7</p>
<p>At the other extreme was Capital One Financial Corp., an issuer of
MasterCard and Visa credit cards. From July 1999, to May 2000, its stock
lost 21.5%. Yet Capital One had 2 billion in total assets and earned 63
million in 1999, up 32% from the year before. With a market value of
about .3 billion, the stock sold at 20 times Capital One’s net earnings.
All might not be well at Capital One—the company had barely raised its
reserves for loans that might go bad, even though default rates tend to
jump in a recession—but its stock price reflected at least some risk of
potential trouble.</p>
<p>What happened next? In 2001, Commerce One generated 09 million in
revenues. Unfortunately, it ran a net loss of .6 billion—or 0.30 of red
ink per share—on those revenues. Capital One, on the other hand, earned
nearly billion in net income in 2000 through 2002. Its stock lost 38% in
those three years—no worse than the stock market as a whole. Commerce
One, however, lost 99.7% of its value.8</p>
<p>Instead of listening to Hoffman and his lapdog analysts, traders
should have heeded the honest warning in Commerce One’s annual report
for 1999: “We have never been profitable. We expect to incur net losses
for the foreseeable future and we may never be profitable.”</p>
<p>Pair 4: Palm and 3COM</p>
<p>On March 2, 2000, the data-networking company 3Com Corp. sold 5% of
its Palm, Inc. subsidiary to the public. The remaining 95% of Palm’s
stock would be spun off to 3Com’s shareholders in the next few months;
for each share of 3Com they held, investors would receive 1.525 shares
of Palm.</p>
<p>So there were two ways you could get 100 shares of Palm: By trying to
elbow your way into the IPO, or by buying 66 shares of 3Com and waiting
until the parent company distributed the rest of the Palm stock. Getting
one-and-a-half shares of Palm for each 3Com share, you’d end up with 100
shares of the new company—and you’d still have 66 shares of 3Com.</p>
<p>But who wanted to wait a few months? While 3Com was struggling
against giant rivals like Cisco, Palm was a leader in the hot “space” of
handheld digital organizers. So Palm’s stock shot up from its offering
price of 8 to close at 5.06, a 150% first-day return. That valued Palm
at more than 1,350 times its earnings over the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>That same day, 3Com’s share price dropped from 04.13 to 1.81. Where
should 3Com have closed that day, given the price of Palm? The
arithmetic is easy:</p>
<p>each 3Com share was entitled to receive 1.525 shares of Palm</p>
<p>each share of Palm closed at 5.06</p>
<p>1.525 5.06 = 44.97</p>
<p>That’s what each 3Com share was worth based on its stake in Palm
alone. Thus, at 1.81, traders were saying that all of 3Com’s other
businesses combined were worth a negative 3.16 per share, or a total of
minus 2 billion! Rarely in history has any stock been priced more
stupidly.9</p>
<p>But there was a catch: Just as 3Com wasn’t really worth minus 2
billion, Palm wasn’t really worth over 1,350 times earnings. By the end
of 2002, both stocks were hurting in the high-tech recession, but it was
Palm’s shareholders who really got smacked—because they abandoned all
common sense when they bought in the first place:</p>

<p>Palm’s Down</p>

<p>Pair 5: CMGI and CGI</p>
<p>The year 2000 started off with a bang for CMGI, Inc., as the stock
hit 63.22 on January 3—a gain of 1,126% over its price just one year
before. The company, an “Internet incubator,” financed and acquired
start-up firms in a variety of online businesses—among them such early
stars as theglobe.com and Lycos.10</p>
<p>In fiscal year 1998, as its stock rose from 98 cents to .52, CMGI
spent 3.8 million acquiring whole or partial stakes in Internet
companies. In fiscal year 1999, as its stock shot from .52 to 6.09, CMGI
shelled out 04.7 million. And in the last five months of 1999, as its
shares zoomed up to 38.44, CMGI spent .1 billion on acquisitions.
Virtually all the “money” was CMGI’s own privately-minted currency: its
common stock, now valued at a total of more than 0 billion.</p>
<p>It was a kind of magical money merry-go-round. The higher CMGI’s own
stock went, the more it could afford to buy. The more CMGI could afford
to buy, the higher its stock went. First stocks would go up on the rumor
that CMGI might buy them; then, once CMGI acquired them, its own stock
would go up because it owned them. No one cared that CMGI had lost 27
million on its operations in the latest fiscal year.</p>
<p>Down in Webster, Massachusetts, less than 70 miles southwest of
CMGI’s headquarters in Andover, sits the main office of Commerce Group,
Inc. CGI was everything CMGI was not: Offering automobile insurance,
mainly to drivers in Massachusetts, it was a cold stock in an old
industry. Its shares lost 23% in 1999—although its net income, at 9
million, ended up falling only 7% below 1998’s level. CGI even paid a
dividend of more than 4% (CMGI paid none). With a total market value of
70 million, CGI stock was trading at less than 10 times what the company
would earn for 1999.</p>
<p>And then, quite suddenly, everything went into reverse. CMGI’s
magical money merry-go-round screeched to a halt: Its dot-com stocks
stopped rising in price, then went straight down. No longer able to sell
them for a profit, CMGI had to take their loss in value as a hit to its
earnings. The company lost .4 billion in 2000, .5 billion in 2001, and
nearly 00 million more in 2002. Its stock went from 63.22 at the
beginning of 2000 to 98 cents by year-end 2002—a loss of 99.4%. Boring
old CGI, however, kept cranking out steady earnings, and its stock rose
8.5% in 2000, 43.6% in 2001, and 2.7% in 2002—a 60% cumulative gain.</p>
<p>Pair 6: Ball and Stryker</p>
<p>Between July 9 and July 23, 2002, Ball Corp.’s stock dropped from
3.69 to 3.48—a loss of 24% that left the company with a stock-market
value of .9 billion. Over the same two weeks, Stryker Corp.’s shares
fell from 9.55 to 5.60, an 8% drop that left Strkyer valued at a total
of billion.</p>
<p>What had made these two companies worth so much less in so short a
time? Stryker, which manufactures orthopedic implants and surgical
equipment, issued only one press release during those two weeks. On July
16, Stryker announced that its sales grew 15% to 34 million in the
second quarter, while earnings jumped 31% to 6 million. The stock rose
7% the next day, then rolled right back downhill.</p>
<p>Ball, the original maker of the famous “Ball Jars” used for canning
fruits and vegetables, now makes metal and plastic packaging for
industrial customers. Ball issued no press releases at all during those
two weeks. On July 25, however, Ball reported that it had earned 0
million on sales of billion in the second quarter—a 61% rise in net
income over the same period one year earlier. That brought its earnings
over the trailing four quarters to 52 million, so the stock was trading
at just 12.5 times Ball’s earnings. And, with a book value of .1
billion, you could buy the stock for 1.7 times what the company’s
tangible assets were worth. (Ball did, however, have just over 00
million in debt.)</p>
<p>Stryker was in a different league. Over the last four quarters, the
company had generated 01 million in net income. Stryker’s book value was
70 million. So the company was trading at fat multiples of 30 times its
earnings over the past 12 months and nearly 16 times its book value. On
the other hand, from 1992 through the end of 2001, Stryker’s earnings
had risen 18.6% annually; its dividend had grown by nearly 21% per year.
And in 2001, Stryker had spent 42 million on research and development to
lay the groundwork for future growth.</p>
<p>What, then, had pounded these two stocks down? Between July 9 and
July 23, 2002, as WorldCom keeled over into bankruptcy, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell from 9096.09 to 7702.34, a 15.3% plunge. The
good news at Ball and Stryker got lost in the bad headlines and falling
markets, which took these two stocks down with them.</p>
<p>Although Ball ended up priced far more cheaply than Stryker, the
lesson here is not that Ball was a steal and Stryker was a wild pitch.
Instead, the intelligent investor should recognize that market panics
can create great prices for good companies (like Ball) and good prices
for great companies (like Stryker). Ball finished 2002 at 1.19 a share,
up 53% from its July low; Stryker ended the year at 7.12, up 47%. Every
once in a while, value and growth stocks alike go on sale. Which choice
you prefer depends largely on your own personality, but bargains can be
had on either side of the plate.</p>
<p>Pair 7: Nortel and Nortek</p>
<p>The 1999 annual report for Nortel Networks, the fiber-optic equipment
company, boasted that it was “a golden year financially.” As of February
2000, at a market value of more than 50 billion, Nortel’s stock traded
at 87 times the earnings that Wall Street’s analysts estimated the
company would produce in 2000.</p>
<p>How credible was that estimate? Nortel’s accounts receivable—sales to
customers that had not yet paid the bill—had shot up by billion in a
year. The company said the rise “was driven by increased sales in the
fourth quarter of 1999.” However, inventories had also ballooned by .2
billion—meaning that Nortel was producing equipment even faster than
those “increased sales” could unload it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nortel’s “long-term receivables”—bills not yet paid for
multi-year contracts—jumped from 19 million to .4 billion. And Nortel
was having a hard time controlling costs; its selling, general, and
administrative expense (or overhead) had risen from 17.6% of revenues in
1997 to 18.7% in 1999. All told, Nortel had lost 51 million in 1999.</p>
<p>Then there was Nortek, Inc., which produces stuff at the dim end of
the glamour spectrum: vinyl siding, door chimes, exhaust fans, range
hoods, trash compactors. In 1999, Nortek earned 9 million on billion in
net sales, up from 1 million in net income on .1 billion in sales in
1997. Nortek’s profit margin (net earnings as a percentage of net sales)
had risen by almost a third from 1.9% to 2.5%. And Nortek had cut
overhead from 19.3% of revenues to 18.1%.</p>
<p>To be fair, much of Nortek’s expansion came from buying other
companies, not from internal growth. What’s more, Nortek had billion in
debt, a big load for a small firm. But, in February 2000, Nortek’s stock
price—roughly five times its earnings in 1999—included a healthy dose of
pessimism.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Nortel’s price—87 times the guesstimate of what it
might earn in the year to come—was a massive overdose of optimism. When
all was said and done, instead of earning the .30 per share that
analysts had predicted, Nortel lost .17 per share in 2000. By the end of
2002, Nortel had bled more than 6 billion in red ink.</p>
<p>Nortek, on the other hand, earned 1.6 million in 2000, million in
2001, and 5 million in the first nine months of 2002. Its stock went
from 8 a share to 5.75 by year-end 2002—a 63% gain. In January 2003,
Nortek’s managers took the company private, buying all the stock from
public investors at 6 per share. Nortel’s stock, meanwhile, sank from
6.81 in February 2000, to .61 at year-end 2002—a 97% loss.</p>
<p>Pair 8: Red Hat and Brown Shoe</p>
<p>On August 11, 1999, Red Hat, Inc., a developer of Linux software,
sold stock to the public for the first time. Red Hat was red-hot;
initially offered at , the shares opened for trading at 3 and closed at
6.031—a 272% gain.11 In a single day, Red Hat’s stock had gone up more
than Brown Shoe’s had in the previous 18 years. By December 9, Red Hat’s
shares hit 43.13—up 1,944% in four months.</p>
<p>Brown Shoe, meanwhile, had its laces tied together. Founded in 1878,
the company wholesales Buster Brown shoes and runs nearly 1,300 footwear
stores in the United States and Canada. Brown Shoe’s stock, at 7.50 a
share on August 11, stumbled down to 4.31 by December 9. For all of
1999, Brown Shoe’s shares lost 17.6%.12</p>
<p>Besides a cool name and a hot stock, what did Red Hat’s investors
get? Over the nine months ending November 30, the company produced 3
million in revenues, on which it ran a net loss of million.13 Red Hat’s
business was barely bigger than a street-corner delicatessen—and a lot
less lucrative. But traders, inflamed by the words “software” and
“Internet,” drove the total value of Red Hat’s shares to 1.3 billion by
December 9.</p>
<p>And Brown Shoe? Over the previous three quarters, the company had
produced .2 billion in net sales and 2 million in earnings. Brown Shoe
had nearly a share in cash and real estate; kids were still buying
Buster Brown shoes. Yet, that December 9, Brown Shoe’s stock had a total
value of 61 million—barely 1/80 the size of Red Hat even though Brown
Shoe had 100 times Red Hat’s revenues. At that price, Brown Shoe was
valued at 7.6 times its annual earnings and less than one-quarter of its
annual sales. Red Hat, on the other hand, had no profits at all, while
its stock was selling at more than 1,000 times its annual sales.</p>
<p>Red Hat the company kept right on gushing red ink. Soon enough, the
stock did too. Brown Shoe, however, trudged out more profits—and so did
its shareholders:</p>

<p>What have we learned? The market scoffs at Graham’s principles in the
short run, but they are always revalidated in the end. If you buy a
stock purely because its price has been going up—instead of asking
whether the underlying company’s value is increasing—then sooner or
later you will be extremely sorry. That’s not a likelihood. It is a
certainty.</p>
