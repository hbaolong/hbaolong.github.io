<h4 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h4>
<p>Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories</p>
<p>The word “extremely” in the title is a kind of pun, because the
histories represent extremes of various sorts that were manifest on Wall
Street in recent years. They hold instruction, and grave warnings, for
everyone who has a serious connection with the world of stocks and
bonds—not only for ordinary investors and speculators but for
professionals, security analysts, fund managers, trust-account
administrators, and even for bankers who lend money to corporations. The
four companies to be reviewed, and the different extremes that they
illustrate are:</p>
<p>Penn Central (Railroad) Co. An extreme example of the neglect of the
most elementary warning signals of financial weakness, by all those who
had bonds or shares of this system under their supervision. A crazily
high market price for the stock of a tottering giant.</p>
<p>Ling-Temco-Vought Inc. An extreme example of quick and unsound
“empire building,” with ultimate collapse practically guaranteed; but
helped by indiscriminate bank lending.</p>
<p>NVF Corp. An extreme example of one corporate acquisition, in which a
small company absorbed another seven times its size, incurring a huge
debt and employing some startling accounting devices.</p>
<p>AAA Enterprises. An extreme example of public stock-financing of a
small company; its value based on the magic word “franchising,” and
little else, sponsored by important stock-exchange houses. Bankruptcy
followed within two years of the stock sale and the doubling of the
initial inflated price in the heedless stock market.</p>
<p>The Penn Central Case</p>
<p>This is the country’s largest railroad in assets and gross revenues.
Its bankruptcy in 1970 shocked the financial world. It has defaulted on
most of its bond issues, and has been in danger of abandoning its
operations entirely. Its security issues fell drastically in price, the
common stock collapsing from a high level of 86½ as recently as 1968 to
a low of 5½ in 1970. (There seems little doubt that these shares will be
wiped out in reorganization.)*</p>
<p>Our basic point is that the application of the simplest rules of
security analysis and the simplest standards of sound investment would
have revealed the fundamental weakness of the Penn Central system long
before its bankruptcy—certainly in 1968, when the shares were selling at
their post-1929 record, and when most of its bond issues could have been
exchanged at even prices for well-secured public-utility obligations
with the same coupon rates. The following comments are in order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the S andandandand P Bond Guide the interest charges of the
system are shown to have been earned 1.91 times in 1967 and 1.98 times
in 1968. The minimum coverage prescribed for railroad bonds in our
textbook Security Analysis is 5 times before income taxes and 2.9 times
after income taxes at regular rates. As far as we know the validity of
these standards has never been questioned by any investment authority.
On the basis of our requirements for earnings after taxes, the Penn
Central fell short of the requirements for safety. But our after-tax
requirement is based on a before-tax ratio of five times, with regular
income tax deducted after the bond interest. In the case of Penn
Central, it had been paying no income taxes to speak of for the past 11
years! Hence the coverage of its interest charges before taxes was less
than two times—a totally inadequate figure against our conservative
requirement of 5 times.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that the company paid no income taxes over so long a
period should have raised serious questions about the validity of its
reported earnings.</p></li>
<li><p>The bonds of the Penn Central system could have been exchanged in
1968 and 1969, at no sacrifice of price or income, for far better
secured issues. For example, in 1969, Pennsylvania RR 4½s, due 1994
(part of Penn Central) had a range of 61 to 74½, while Pennsylvania
Electric Co. 4 3/8s, due 1994, had a range of 64¼ to 72¼. The public
utility had earned its interest 4.20 times before taxes in 1968 against
only 1.98 times for the Penn Central system; during 1969 the latter’s
comparative showing grew steadily worse. An exchange of this sort was
clearly called for, and it would have been a lifesaver for a Penn
Central bondholder. (At the end of 1970 the railroad 4¼s were in
default, and selling at only 18½, while the utility’s 4 3/8s closed at
66½.)</p></li>
<li><p>Penn Central reported earnings of .80 per share in 1968; its high
price of 86½ in that year was 24 times such earnings. But any analyst
worth his salt would have wondered how “real” were earnings of this sort
reported without the necessity of paying any income taxes
thereon.</p></li>
<li><p>For 1966 the newly merged company* had reported “earnings” of .80
a share—in reflection of which the common stock later rose to its peak
of 86½. This was a valuation of over billion for the equity. How many of
these buyers knew at the time that the so lovely earnings were before a
special charge of 75 million or 2 per share to be taken in 1971 for
“costs and losses” incurred on the merger. O wondrous fairyland of Wall
Street where a company can announce “profits” of .80 per share in one
place and special “costs and losses” of 2 in another, and shareholders
and speculators rub their hands with glee!†</p></li>
<li><p>A railroad analyst would have long since known that the operating
picture of the Penn Central was very bad in comparison with the more
profitable roads. For example, its transportation ratio was 47.5% in
1968 against 35.2% for its neighbor, Norfolk andandandand
Western.*</p></li>
<li><p>Along the way there were some strange transactions with peculiar
accounting results.1 Details are too complicated to go into
here.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>CONCLUSION: Whether better management could have saved the Penn
Central bankruptcy may be arguable. But there is no doubt whatever that
no bonds and no shares of the Penn Central system should have remained
after 1968 at the latest in any securities account watched over by
competent security analysts, fund managers, trust officers, or
investment counsel. Moral: Security analysts should do their elementary
jobs before they study stock-market movements, gaze into crystal balls,
make elaborate mathematical calculations, or go on all-expense-paid
field trips.†</p>
<p>Ling-Temco-Vought Inc.</p>
<p>This is a story of head-over-heels expansion and head-overheels debt,
ending up in terrific losses and a host of financial problems. As
usually happens in such cases, a fair-haired boy, or “young genius,” was
chiefly responsible for both the creation of the great empire and its
ignominious downfall; but there is plenty of blame to be accorded others
as well. †</p>
<p>The rise and fall of Ling-Temco-Vought can be summarized by setting
forth condensed income accounts and balance-sheet items for five years
between 1958 and 1970. This is done in Table 17-1. The first column
shows the company’s modest beginnings in 1958, when its sales were only
million. The next gives figures for 1960; the enterprise had grown
twentyfold in only two years, but it was still comparatively small. Then
came the heyday years to 1967 and 1968, in which sales again grew
twentyfold to .8 billion with the debt figure expanding from 4 million
to an awesome ,653 million. In 1969 came new acquisitions, a further
huge increase in debt (to a total of ,865 million!), and the beginning
of serious trouble. A large loss, after extraordinary items, was
reported for the year; the stock price declined from its 1967 high of
169½ to a low of 24; the young genius was superseded as the head of the
company. The 1970 results were even more dreadful. The enterprise
reported a final net loss of close to 0 million; the stock fell away to
a low price of 7 1/8, and its largest bond issue was quoted at one time
at a pitiable 15 cents on the dollar. The company’s expansion policy was
sharply reversed, various of its important interests were placed on the
market, and some headway was made in reducing its mountainous
obligations.</p>
<p>The figures in our table speak so eloquently that few comments are
called for. But here are some:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The company’s expansion period was not without an interruption.
In 1961 it showed a small operating deficit, but—adopting a practice
that was to be seen later in so many reports for 1970—evidently decided
to throw all possible charges and reserves into the one bad year.* These
amounted to a round 3 million, which was more than the combined net
profits of the preceding three years. It was now ready to show “record
earnings” in 1962, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of 1966 the net tangible assets are given as .66 per
share of common (adjusted for a 3-for-2 split). Thus the market price in
1967 reached 22 times (!) its reported asset value at the time. At the
end of 1968 the balance sheet showed 86 million available for 3,800,000
shares of common and Class AA stock, or about 7 per share. But if we
deduct the preferred stock at full value and exclude the good-will items
and the huge bond-discount “asset,”† there would remain 3 million for
the common—a mere per share. This tangible equity was wiped out by the
losses of the following years.</p></li>
<li><p>Toward the end of 1967 two of our best-regarded banking firms
offered 600,000 shares of Ling-Temco-Vought stock at 11 per share. It
had been as high as 169½. In less than three years the price fell to 7
1/8.†</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of 1967 the bank loans had reached 61 million, and a
year later they stood at 14 million—which should have been a frightening
figure. In addition, the long-term debt amounted to ,237 million. By
1969 combined debt reached a total of ,869 million. This may have been
the largest combined debt figure of any industrial company anywhere and
at any time, with the single exception of the impregnable Standard Oil
of N.J.</p></li>
<li><p>The losses in 1969 and 1970 far exceeded the total profits since
the formation of the company.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>MORAL: The primary question raised in our mind by the
Ling-Temco-Vought story is how the commercial bankers could have been
persuaded to lend the company such huge amounts of money during its
expansion period. In 1966 and earlier the company’s coverage of interest
charges did not meet conservative standards, and the same was true of
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities and of stock equity
to total debt. But in the next two years the banks advanced the
enterprise nearly 00 million additional for further “diversification.”
This was not good business for them, and it was worse in its
implications for the company’s shareholders. If the Ling-Temco-Vought
case will serve to keep commercial banks from aiding and abetting
unsound expansions of this type in the future, some good may come of it
at last.*</p>
<p>The NVF Takeover of Sharon Steel (A Collector’s Item)</p>
<p>At the end of 1968 NVF Company was a company with .6 million of
long-term debt, 7.4 million of stock capital, 1 million of sales, and
02,000 of net income (before a special credit of 74,000). Its business
was described as “vulcanized fiber and plastics.” The management decided
to take over the Sharon Steel Corp., which had 3 million of long-term
debt, 01 million of stock capital, 19 million of sales, and ,929,000 of
net earnings. The company it wished to acquire was thus seven times the
size of NVF. In early 1969 it made an offer for all the shares of
Sharon. The terms per share were 0 face amount of NVF junior 5% bonds,
due 1994, plus warrants to buy 1½ shares of NVF stock at 2 per share of
NVF. The management of Sharon strenuously resisted this takeover
attempt, but in vain. NVF acquired 88% of the Sharon stock under the
offer, issuing therefore 02 million of its 5% bonds and warrants for
2,197,000 of its shares. Had the offer been 100% operative the
consolidated enterprise would, for the year 1968, have had 63 million in
debt, only .2 million in tangible stock capital, 50 million of sales.
The net-earnings question would have been a bit complicated, but the
company subsequently stated them as a net loss of 50 cents per share of
NVF stocks, before an extraordinary credit, and net earnings of 3 cents
per share after such credit.*</p>
<p>FIRST COMMENT: Among all the takeovers effected in the year 1969 this
was no doubt the most extreme in its financial disproportions. The
acquiring company had assumed responsibility for a new and top-heavy
debt obligation, and it had changed its calculated 1968 earnings from a
profit to a loss into the bargain. A measure of the impairment of the
company’s financial position by this step is found in the fact that the
new 5% bonds did not sell higher than 42 cents on the dollar during the
year of issuance. This would have indicated grave doubt of the safety of
the bonds and of the company’s future; however, the management actually
exploited the bond price in a way to save the company annual income
taxes of about ,000,000 as will be shown.</p>
<p>The 1968 report, published after the Sharon takeover, contained a
condensed picture of its results, carried back to the year-end. This
contained two most unusual items:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is listed as an asset 8,600,000 of “deferred debt expense.”
This sum is greater than the entire “stockholders’ equity,” placed at
0,200,000.</p></li>
<li><p>However, not included in the shareholders’ equity is an item of
0,700,000 designated as “excess of equity over cost of investment in
Sharon.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>SECOND COMMENT: If we eliminate the debt expense as an asset, which
it hardly seems to be, and include the other item in the shareholders’
equity (where it would normally belong), then we have a more realistic
statement of tangible equity for NVF stock, viz., ,200,000. Thus the
first effect of the deal was to reduce NVF’s “real equity” from
7,400,000 to ,200,000 or from 3.71 per share to about per share, on
731,000 shares. In addition the NVF shareholders had given to others the
right to buy 3½ times as many additional shares at six points below the
market price at the close of 1968. The initial market value of the
warrants was then about 2 each, or a total of some 0 million for those
involved in the purchase offer. Actually, the market value of the
warrants well exceeded the total market value of the outstanding NVF
stock—another evidence of the tail-wagging-dog nature of the
transaction.</p>
<p>The Accounting Gimmicks</p>
<p>When we pass from this pro forma balance sheet to the next year’s
report we find several strange-appearing entries. In addition to the
basic interest expense (a hefty ,500,000), there is deducted ,795,000
for “amortization of deferred debt expense.” But this last is nearly
offset on the next line by a very unusual income item indeed:
“amortization of equity over cost of investment in subsidiary: Cr.
,650,000.” In one of the footnotes we find an entry, not appearing in
any other report that we know of: Part of the stock capital is there
designated as “fair market value of warrants issued in connection with
acquisition, etc., 2,129,000.”</p>
<p>What on earth do all these entries mean? None of them is even
referred to in the descriptive text of the 1969 report. The trained
security analyst has to figure out these mysteries by himself, almost in
detective fashion. He finds that the underlying idea is to derive a tax
advantage from the low initial price of the 5% debentures. For readers
who may be interested in this ingenious arrangement we set forth our
solution in Appendix 6.</p>
<p>Other Unusual Items</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Right after the close of 1969 the company bought in no less than
650,000 warrants at a price of .38 each. This was extraordinary when we
consider that (a) NVF itself had only 00,000 in cash at the year-end,
and had ,400,000 of debt due in 1970 (evidently the million paid for the
warrants had to be borrowed); (b) it was buying in this warrant “paper
money” at a time when its 5% bonds were selling at less than 40 cents on
the dollar—ordinarily a warning that financial difficulties lay
ahead.</p></li>
<li><p>As a partial offset to this, the company had retired ,100,000 of
its bonds along with 253,000 warrants in exchange for a like amount of
common stock. This was possible because, by the vagaries of the
securities markets, people were selling the 5% bonds at less than 40
while the common sold at an average price of 13½, paying no
dividend.</p></li>
<li><p>The company had plans in operation not only for selling stock to
its employees, but also for selling them a larger number of warrants to
buy the stock. Like the stock purchases the warrants were to be paid for
5% down and the rest over many years in the future. This is the only
such employee-purchase plan for warrants that we know of. Will someone
soon invent and sell on installments a right to buy a right to buy a
share, and so on?</p></li>
<li><p>In the year 1969 the newly controlled Sharon Steel Co. changed
its method of arriving at its pension costs, and also adopted lower
depreciation rates. These accounting changes added about per share to
the reported earnings of NVF before dilution.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of 1970 Standard andandandand Poor’s Stock Guide
reported that NVF shares were selling at a price/earning ratio of only
2, the lowest figure for all the 4,500-odd issues in the booklet. As the
old Wall Street saying went, this was “important if true.” The ratio was
based on the year’s closing price of 8 3/4 and the computed “earnings”
of .38 per share for the 12 months ended September 1970. (Using these
figures the shares were selling at only 1.6 times earnings.) But this
ratio did not allow for the large dilution factor,* nor for the adverse
results actually realized in the last quarter of 1970. When the full
year’s figures finally appeared, they showed only .03 per share earned
for the stock, before allowing for dilution, and .80 per share on a
diluted basis. Note also that the aggregate market price of the stock
and warrants on that date was about 4 million against a bonded debt of
35 million—a skimpy equity position indeed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>AAA Enterprises</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>About 15 years ago a college student named Williams began selling
mobile homes (then called “trailers”).† In 1965 he incorporated his
business. In that year he sold ,800,000 of mobile homes and earned 1,000
before corporate tax. By 1968 he had joined the “franchising” movement
and was selling others the right to sell mobile homes under his business
name. He also conceived the bright idea of going into the business of
preparing income-tax returns, using his mobile homes as offices. He
formed a subsidiary company called Mr. Tax of America, and of course
started to sell franchises to others to use the idea and the name. He
multiplied the number of corporate shares to 2,710,000 and was ready for
a stock offering. He found that one of our largest stock-exchange
houses, along with others, was willing to handle the deal. In March 1969
they offered the public 500,000 shares of AAA Enterprises at 3 per
share. Of these, 300,000 were sold for Mr. Williams’s personal account
and 200,000 were sold for the company account, adding ,400,000 to its
resources. The price of the stock promptly doubled to 28, or a value of
4 million for the equity, against a book value of, say, ,200,000 and
maximum reported earnings of 90,000. The stock was thus selling at a
tidy 115 times its current (and largest) earnings per share. No doubt
Mr. Williams had selected the name AAA Enterprise so that it might be
among the first in the phone books and the yellow pages. A collateral
result was that his company was destined to appear as the first name in
Standard andandandand Poor’s Stock Guide. Like Abu-Ben-Adhem’s, it led
all the rest.* This gives a special reason to select it as a harrowing
example of 1969 new financing and “hot issues.”</p>
<p>COMMENT: This was not a bad deal for Mr. Williams. The 300,000 shares
he sold had a book value in December of 1968 of 80,000 and he netted
therefor 20 times as much, or a cool ,600,000. The underwriters and
distributors split 00,000 between them, less expenses.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This did not seem so brilliant a deal for the clients of the
selling houses. They were asked to pay about ten times the book value of
the stock, after the bootstrap operation of increasing their equity per
share from 59 cents to .35 with their own money.* Before the best year
1968, the company’s maximum earnings had been a ridiculous 7 cents per
share. There were ambitious plans for the future, of course—but the
public was being asked to pay heavily in advance for the hoped-for
realization of these plans.</p></li>
<li><p>Nonetheless, the price of the stock doubled soon after original
issuance, and any one of the brokerage-house clients could have gotten
out at a handsome profit. Did this fact alter the flotation, or did the
advance possibility that it might happen exonerate the original
distributors of the issue from responsibility for this public offering
and its later sequel? Not an easy question to answer, but it deserves
careful consideration by Wall Street and the government regulatory
agencies.†</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Subsequent History</p>
<p>With its enlarged capital AAA Enterprises went into two additional
businesses. In 1969 it opened a chain of retail carpet stores, and it
acquired a plant that manufactured mobile homes. The results reported
for the first nine months were not exactly brilliant, but they were a
little better than the year before—22 cents a share against 14 cents.
What happened in the next months was literally incredible. The company
lost ,365,000, or .49 per share. This consumed all its capital before
the financing, plus the entire ,400,000 received on the sale of stock
plus two-thirds of the amount reported as earned in the first nine
months of 1969. There was left a pathetic 42,000, or 8 cents per share,
of capital for the public shareholders who had paid 3 for the new
offering only seven months before. Nonetheless the shares closed the
year 1969 at 8 1/8 bid, or a “valuation” of more than 5 million for the
company.</p>
<p>FURTHER COMMENT: 1. It is too much to believe that the company had
actually earned 86,000 from January to September 1969 and then lost
,365,000 in the next three months. There was something sadly, badly, and
accusingly wrong about the September 30 report.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The year’s closing price of 8 1/8 bid was even more of a
demonstration of the complete heedlessness of stock-market prices than
were the original offering price of 13 or the subsequent “hot-issue”
advance to a high bid of 28. These latter quotations at least were based
on enthusiasm and hope—out of all proportion to reality and common
sense, but at least comprehensible. The year-end valuation of 5 million
was given to a company that had lost all but a minuscule remnant of its
capital, for which a completely insolvent condition was imminent, and
for which the words “enthusiasm” or “hope” would be only bitter
sarcasms. (It is true the year-end figures had not been published by
December 31, but it is the business of Wall Street houses associated
with a company to have monthly operating statements and a fairly exact
idea of how things are going.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Final Chapter</p>
<p>For the first half of 1970 the company reported a further loss of
million. It now had a good-sized capital deficit. It was kept out of
bankruptcy by loans made by Mr. Williams, up to a total of ,500,000. No
further statements seem to have been issued, until in January 1971 AAA
Enterprises finally filed a petition in bankruptcy. The quotation for
the stock at month-end was still 50 cents a share bid, or ,500,000 for
the entire issue, which evidently had no more than wallpaper value. End
of our story.</p>
<p>MORAL AND QUESTIONS: The speculative public is incorrigible. In
financial terms it cannot count beyond 3. It will buy anything, at any
price, if there seems to be some “action” in progress. It will fall for
any company identified with “franchising,” computers, electronics,
science, technology, or what have you, when the particular fashion is
raging. Our readers, sensible investors all, are of course above such
foolishness. But questions remain: Should not responsible investment
houses be honor-bound to refrain from identifying themselves with such
enterprises, nine out of ten of which may be foredoomed to ultimate
failure? (This was actually the situation when the author entered Wall
Street in 1914. By comparison it would seem that the ethical standards
of the “Street” have fallen rather than advanced in the ensuing 57
years, despite all the reforms and all the controls.) Could and should
the SEC be given other powers to protect the public, beyond the present
ones which are limited to requiring the printing of all important
relevant facts in the offering prospectus? Should some kind of box score
for public offerings of various types be compiled and published in
conspicuous fashion? Should every prospectus, and perhaps every
confirmation of sale under an original offering, carry some kind of
formal warranty that the offering price for the issue is not
substantially out of line with the ruling prices for issues of the same
general type already established in the market? As we write this edition
a movement toward reform of Wall Street abuses is under way. It will be
difficult to impose worthwhile changes in the field of new offerings,
because the abuses are so largely the result of the public’s own
heedlessness and greed. But the matter deserves long and careful
consideration.*</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 17</p>
<p>The wisdom god, Woden, went out to the king of the trolls, got him in
an armlock, and demanded to know of him how order might triumph over
chaos. “Give me your left eye,” said the troll, “and I’ll tell you.”
Without hesitation, Woden gave up his left eye. “Now tell me.” The troll
said, “The secret is, ‘Watch with both eyes!’”</p>

<p>The More Things Change…</p>
<p>Graham highlights four extremes:</p>
<p>an overpriced “tottering giant”</p>
<p>an empire-building conglomerate</p>
<p>a merger in which a tiny firm took over a big one</p>
<p>an initial public offering of shares in a basically worthless
company</p>
<p>The past few years have provided enough new cases of Graham’s
extremes to fill an encyclopedia. Here is a sampler:</p>
<p>Lucent, Not Transparent</p>
<p>In mid-2000, Lucent Technologies Inc. was owned by more investors
than any other U.S. stock. With a market capitalization of 92.9 billion,
it was the 12th-most-valuable company in America.</p>
<p>Was that giant valuation justified? Let’s look at some basics from
Lucent’s financial report for the fiscal quarter ended June 30,
2000:1</p>
<p>FIGURE 17-1 Lucent Technologies Inc.</p>
<p>All numbers in millions of dollars. * Other assets, which includes
goodwill.</p>
<p>Source: Lucent quarterly financial reports (Form 10-Q).</p>
<p>A closer reading of Lucent’s report sets alarm bells jangling like an
unanswered telephone switchboard:</p>
<p>Lucent had just bought an optical equipment supplier, Chromatis
Networks, for .8 billion—of which .2 billion was “goodwill” (or cost
above book value). Chromatis had 150 employees, no customers, and zero
revenues, so the term “goodwill” seems inadequate; perhaps “hope chest”
is more accurate. If Chromatis’s embryonic products did not work out,
Lucent would have to reverse the goodwill and charge it off against
future earnings.</p>
<p>A footnote discloses that Lucent had lent .5 billion to purchasers of
its products. Lucent was also on the hook for 50 million in guarantees
for money its customers had borrowed elsewhere. The total of these
“customer financings” had doubled in a year—suggesting that purchasers
were running out of cash to buy Lucent’s products. What if they ran out
of cash to pay their debts?</p>
<p>Finally, Lucent treated the cost of developing new software as a
“capital asset.” Rather than an asset, wasn’t that a routine business
expense that should come out of earnings?</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: In August 2001, Lucent shut down the Chromatis division
after its products reportedly attracted only two customers.2 In fiscal
year 2001, Lucent lost 6.2 billion; in fiscal year 2002, it lost another
1.9 billion. Included in those losses were .5 billion in “provisions for
bad debts and customer financings,” .1 billion in “impairment charges
related to goodwill,” and 62 million in charges “related to capitalized
software.”</p>
<p>Lucent’s stock, at 1.062 on June 30, 2000, finished 2002 at .26—a
loss of nearly 90 billion in market value in two-and-a-half years.</p>
<p>The Acquisition Magician</p>
<p>To describe Tyco International Ltd., we can only paraphrase Winston
Churchill and say that never has so much been sold by so many to so few.
From 1997 through 2001, this Bermuda-based conglomerate spent a total of
more than 7 billion—most of it in shares of Tyco stock—buying companies
the way Imelda Marcos bought shoes. In fiscal year 2000 alone, according
to its annual report, Tyco acquired “approximately 200 companies”—an
average of more than one every other day.</p>
<p>The result? Tyco grew phenomenally fast; in five years, revenues went
from .6 billion to 4 billion, and operating income shot from a 76
million loss to a .2 billion gain. No wonder the company had a total
stock-market value of 14 billion at the end of 2001.</p>
<p>But Tyco’s financial statements were at least as mind-boggling as its
growth. Nearly every year, they featured hundreds of millions of dollars
in acquisition-related charges. These expenses fell into three main
categories:</p>
<p>“merger” or “restructuring” or “other nonrecurring” costs,</p>
<p>“charges for the impairment of long-lived assets,” and</p>
<p>“write-offs of purchased in-process research and development.”</p>
<p>For the sake of brevity, let’s refer to the first kind of charge as
MORON, the second as CHILLA, and the third as WOOPIPRAD. How did they
show up over time?</p>
<p>FIGURE 17-2 Tyco International Ltd.</p>
<p>All figures are as originally reported, stated in hundreds of
millions of dollars.</p>
<p>“Mergers andandandand acquisitions” totals do not include
pooling-of-interests deals.</p>
<p>Source: Tyco International annual reports (Form 10-K).</p>
<p>As you can see, the MORON charges—which are supposed to be
nonrecurring—showed up in four out of five years and totaled a whopping
.5 billion. CHILLA cropped up just as chronically and amounted to more
than 00 million. WOOPIPRAD came to another half-billion dollars.3</p>
<p>The intelligent investor would ask:</p>
<p>If Tyco’s strategy of growth-through-acquisition was such a neat
idea, how come it had to spend an average of 50 million a year cleaning
up after itself?</p>
<p>If, as seems clear, Tyco was not in the business of making things—but
rather in the business of buying other companies that make things—then
why were its MORON charges “nonrecurring”? Weren’t they just part of
Tyco’s normal costs of doing business?</p>
<p>And with accounting charges for past acquisitions junking up every
year’s earnings, who could tell what next year’s would be?</p>
<p>In fact, an investor couldn’t even tell what Tyco’s past earnings
were. In 1999, after an accounting review by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, Tyco retroactively added 57 million in MORON
charges to its 1998 expenses—meaning that those “nonrecurring” costs had
actually recurred in that year, too. At the same time, the company
rejiggered its originally reported 1999 charges: MORON dropped to 29
million while CHILLA rose to 07 million.</p>
<p>Tyco was clearly growing in size, but was it growing more profitable?
No outsider could safely tell.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: In fiscal year 2002, Tyco lost .4 billion. The stock,
which had closed at 8.90 at year-end 2001, finished 2002 at 7.08—a loss
of 71% in twelve months.4</p>
<p>A Minnow Swallows a Whale</p>
<p>On January 10, 2000, America Online, Inc. and Time Warner
Inc. announced that they would merge in a deal initially valued at 56
billion.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 1999, AOL had 0.3 billion in assets, and its
revenues over the previous 12 months had amounted to .7 billion. Time
Warner, on the other hand, had 1.2 billion in assets and revenues of 7.3
billion. Time Warner was a vastly bigger company by any measure except
one: the valuation of its stock. Because America Online bedazzled
investors simply by being in the Internet industry, its stock sold for a
stupendous 164 times its earnings. Stock in Time Warner, a grab bag of
cable television, movies, music, and magazines, sold for around 50 times
earnings.</p>
<p>In announcing the deal, the two companies called it a “strategic
merger of equals.” Time Warner’s chairman, Gerald M. Levin, declared
that “the opportunities are limitless for everyone connected to AOL Time
Warner”—above all, he added, for its shareholders.</p>
<p>Ecstatic that their stock might finally get the cachet of an Internet
darling, Time Warner shareholders overwhelmingly approved the deal. But
they overlooked a few things:</p>
<p>This “merger of equals” was designed to give America Online’s
shareholders 55% of the combined company—even though Time Warner was
five times bigger.</p>
<p>For the second time in three years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission was investigating whether America Online had improperly
accounted for marketing costs.</p>
<p>Nearly half of America Online’s total assets—.9 billion worth—was
made up of “available-for-sale equity securities.” If the prices of
publicly-traded technology stocks fell, that could wipe out much of the
company’s asset base.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: On January 11, 2001, the two firms finalized their
merger. AOL Time Warner Inc. lost .9 billion in 2001 and—in the most
gargantuan loss ever recorded by a corporation—another 8.7 billion in
2002. Most of the losses came from writing down the value of America
Online. By year-end 2002, the shareholders for whom Levin predicted
“unlimited” opportunities had nothing to show but a roughly 80% loss in
the value of their shares since the deal was first announced.5</p>
<p>Can You Flunk Investing Kindergarten?</p>
<p>On May 20, 1999, eToys Inc. sold 8% of its stock to the public. Four
of Wall Street’s most prestigious investment banks—Goldman, Sachs
andandandand Co.; BancBoston Robertson Stephens; Donaldson, Lufkin
andandandand Jenrette; and Merrill Lynch andandandand Co.—underwrote
8,320,000 shares at 0 apiece, raising 66.4 million. The stock roared up,
closing at 6.5625, a 282.8% gain in its first day of trading. At that
price, eToys (with its 102 million shares) had a market value of .8
billion.1</p>
<p>What kind of business did buyers get for that price? eToys’ sales had
risen 4,261% in the previous year, and it had added 75,000 customers in
the last quarter alone. But, in its 20 months in business, eToys had
produced total sales of 0.6 million, on which it had run a net loss of
0.8 million—meaning that eToys was spending to sell every dollar’s worth
of toys.</p>
<p>The IPO prospectus also disclosed that eToys would use some proceeds
of the offering to acquire another online operation, Baby-Center, Inc.,
which had lost .5 million on .8 million in sales over the previous year.
(To land this prize, eToys would pay a mere 05 million.) And eToys would
“reserve” 40.6 million shares of common stock for future issuance to its
management. So, if eToys ever made money, its net income would have to
be divided not among 102 million shares, but among 143 million—diluting
any future earnings per share by nearly one-third.</p>
<p>A comparison of eToys with Toys “R” Us, Inc.—its biggest rival—is
shocking. In the preceding three months, Toys “R” Us had earned 7
million in net income and had sold over 70 times more goods than eToys
had sold in an entire year. And yet as Figure 17-3 shows, the stock
market valued eToys at nearly billion more than Toys “R” Us.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: On March 7, 2001, eToys filed for bankruptcy protection
after racking up net losses of more than 98 million in its brief life as
a public company. The stock, which peaked at 6 per share in October
1999, last traded for a penny.</p>
