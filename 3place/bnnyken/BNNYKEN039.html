<h4 id="people-like-that-are-the-only-people-here">People Like That Are
the Only People Here</h4>
<p>By Lorrie Moore (1997)</p>
<p>A beginning, an end: there seems to be neither. The whole thing is
like a cloud that just lands, and everywhere inside it is full of rain.
A start: the Mother finds a blood clot in the Baby’s diaper. What is the
story? Who put this here? It is big and bright, with a broken,
khaki-colored vein in it. Over the weekend, the Baby had looked listless
and spacey, clayey and grim. But today he looks fine—so what is this
thing, startling against the white diaper, like a tiny mouse heart
packed in snow? Perhaps it belongs to someone else. Perhaps it is
something menstrual, something belonging to the Mother or to the
Babysitter, something the Baby has found in a wastebasket and for his
own demented baby reasons stowed away here. (Babies—they’re crazy! What
can you do?) In her mind, the Mother takes this away from his body and
attaches it to someone else’s. There. Doesn’t that make more sense?</p>
<p>Still, she phones the children’s-hospital clinic. Blood in the
diaper, she says, and, sounding alarmed and perplexed, the woman on the
other end says, “Come in now.”</p>
<p>Such pleasingly instant service! Just say “blood.” Just say “diaper.”
Look what you get!</p>
<p>In the examination room, the pediatrician, the nurse, and the head
resident all seem less alarmed and perplexed than simply perplexed. At
first, stupidly, the Mother is calmed by this. But soon, besides peering
and saying “Hmm,” the doctor, the nurse, and the head resident are all
drawing their mouths in, bluish and tight—morning glories sensing noon.
They fold their arms across their white-coated chests, unfold them
again, and jot things down. They order an ultrasound. Bladder and
kidneys. Here’s the card. Go downstairs, turn left.</p>
<p>In Radiology, the Baby stands anxiously on the table, naked against
the Mother, as she holds him still against her legs and waist, the
Radiologist’s cold scanning disk moving about the Baby’s back. The Baby
whimpers, looks up at the Mother. Let’s get out of here, his eyes beg.
Pick me up! The Radiologist stops, freezes one of the many swirls of
oceanic gray, and clicks repeatedly, a single moment within the long,
cavernous weather map that is the Baby’s insides.</p>
<p>“Are you finding something?” asks the Mother. Last year, her Uncle
Larry had a kidney removed for something that turned out to be benign.
These imaging machines! They are like dogs, or metal detectors: they
find everything but don’t know what they’ve found. That’s where the
surgeons come in. They’re like the owners of the dogs. Give me that,
they say to the dog. What the heck is that?</p>
<p>“The surgeon will speak to you,” says the Radiologist.</p>
<p>“Are you finding something?”</p>
<p>“The surgeon will speak to you,” the Radiologist says again. “There
seems to be something there, but the surgeon will talk to you about
it.”</p>
<p>“My uncle once had something on his kidney,” says the Mother. “So
they removed the kidney and it turned out the something was benign.”</p>
<p>The Radiologist smiles a broad, ominous smile. “That’s always the way
it is,” he says. “You don’t know exactly what it is until it’s in the
bucket.”</p>
<p>“In the bucket,” the Mother repeats.</p>
<p>“That’s doctor talk,” the Radiologist says.</p>
<p>“It’s very appealing,” says the Mother. “It’s a very appealing way to
talk.” Swirls of bile and blood, mustard and maroon in a pail, the
colors of an African flag or some exuberant salad bar: in the bucket—she
imagines it all.</p>
<p>“The surgeon will see you soon,” he says again. He tousles the Baby’s
ringlety hair. “Cute kid,” he says.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>“Let’s see now,” says the Surgeon, in one of his examining rooms. He
has stepped in, then stepped out, then come back in again. He has crisp,
frowning features, sharp bones, and a tennis-in-Bermuda tan. He crosses
his blue-cottoned legs. He is wearing clogs.</p>
<p>The Mother knows her own face is a big white dumpling of worry. She
is still wearing her long, dark parka, holding the Baby, who has pulled
the hood up over her head because he always thinks it’s funny to do
that. Though on certain windy mornings she would like to think she could
look vaguely romantic like this, like some French Lieutenant’s Woman of
the Prairie, in all her saner moments she knows she doesn’t. She knows
she looks ridiculous—like one of those animals made out of twisted party
balloons. She lowers the hood and slips one arm out of the sleeve. The
Baby wants to get up and play with the light switch. He fidgets, fusses,
and points.</p>
<p>“He’s big on lights these days,” explains the Mother.</p>
<p>“That’s O.K.,” says the Surgeon, nodding toward the light switch.
“Let him play with it.” The Mother goes and stands by it, and the Baby
begins turning the lights off and on, off and on.</p>
<p>“What we have here is a Wilms’ tumor,” says the Surgeon, suddenly
plunged into darkness. He says “tumor” as if it were the most normal
thing in the world.</p>
<p>“Wilms’?” repeats the Mother. The room is quickly on fire again with
light, then wiped dark again. Among the three of them here there is a
long silence, as if it were suddenly the middle of the night. “Is that
apostrophe ‘s’ or ‘s’ apostrophe?” the Mother says finally. She is a
writer and a teacher. Spelling can be important—perhaps even at a time
like this, though she has never before been at a time like this, so
there are barbarisms she could easily commit without knowing.</p>
<p>The lights come on; the world is doused and exposed.</p>
<p>“ ‘S’ apostrophe,” says the Surgeon. “I think.” The lights go back
out, but the Surgeon continues speaking in the dark. “A malignant tumor
of the left kidney.”</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Hold on here. The Baby is only a baby, fed on organic
applesauce and soy milk—a little prince!—and he was standing so close to
her during the ultrasound. How could he have this terrible thing? It
must have been her kidney. A fifties kidney. A DDT kidney. The Mother
clears her throat. “Is it possible it was my kidney on the scan? I mean,
I’ve never heard of a baby with a tumor, and, frankly, I was standing
very close.” She would make the blood hers, the tumor hers; it would all
be some treacherous, farcical mistake.</p>
<p>“No, that’s not possible,” says the Surgeon. The light goes back
on.</p>
<p>“It’s not?” says the Mother. Wait until it’s in the bucket, she
thinks. Don’t be so sure. Do we have to wait until it’s in the bucket to
find out a mistake has been made?</p>
<p>“We will start with a radical nephrectomy,” says the Surgeon,
instantly thrown into darkness again. His voice comes from nowhere and
everywhere at once. “And then we’ll begin with chemotherapy after that.
These tumors usually respond very well to chemo.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard of a baby having chemo,” the Mother says. Baby and
Chemo, she thinks: they should never even appear in the same sentence
together, let alone the same life. In her other life, her life before
this day, she was a believer in alternative medicine. Chemotherapy?
Unthinkable. Now, suddenly, alternative medicine seems the wacko maiden
aunt to the Nice Big Daddy of Conventional Treatment. How quickly the
old girl faints and gives way, leaves one just standing there. Chemo? Of
course: chemo! Why, by all means: chemo. Absolutely! Chemo!</p>
<p>The Baby flicks the switch back on, and the walls reappear, big
wedges of light checkered with small framed watercolors of the local
lake. The Mother has begun to cry: all of life has led her here, to this
moment. After this there is no more life. There is something else,
something stumbling and unlivable, something mechanical, something for
robots, but not life. Life has been taken and broken, quickly, like a
stick. The room goes dark again, so that the Mother can cry more freely.
How can a baby’s body be stolen so fast? How much can one heaven-sent
and unsuspecting child endure? Why has he not been spared this
inconceivable fate?</p>
<p>Perhaps, she thinks, she is being punished: too many babysitters too
early on. (“Come to Mommy! Come to Mommy-Babysitter!” she used to say.
But it was a joke!) Her life, perhaps, bore too openly the marks and
wigs of deepest drag. Her unmotherly thoughts had all been noted: the
panicky hope that his nap would last just a little longer than it did;
her occasional desire to kiss him passionately on the mouth (to make out
with her baby!); her ongoing complaints about the very vocabulary of
motherhood, how it degraded the speaker. (“Is this a poopie onesie? Yes,
it’s a very poopie onesie!”) She had, moreover, on three occasions used
the formula bottles as flower vases. She twice let the Baby’s ears get
fudgy with wax. A few afternoons last month, at snack time, she placed a
bowl of Cheerios on the floor for him to eat, like a dog. She let him
play with the Dustbuster. Just once, before he was born, she said,
“Healthy? I just want the kid to be rich.” A joke, for God’s sake. After
he was born, she announced that her life had become a daily sequence of
mind-wrecking chores, the same ones over and over again, like a novel by
Mrs. Camus. Another joke! These jokes will kill you. She had told too
often, and with too much enjoyment, the story of how the Baby had said
“Hi” to his high chair, waved at the lake waves, shouted
“Goody-goody-goody” in what seemed to be a Russian accent, pointed at
his eyes and said “Ice.” And all that nonsensical baby talk: wasn’t it a
stitch? Canonical babbling, the language experts called it. He recounted
whole stories in it, totally made up, she could tell; he embroidered, he
fished, he exaggerated. What a card! To friends she spoke of his eating
habits (carrots yes, tuna no). She mentioned, too much, his
sidesplitting giggle. Did she have to be so boring? Did she have no
consideration for others, for the intellectual demands and courtesies of
human society? Would she not even attempt to be more interesting? It was
a crime against the human mind not even to try.</p>
<p>Now her baby, for all these reasons—lack of motherly gratitude,
motherly judgment, motherly proportion—will be taken away.</p>
<p>The room is fluorescently ablaze again. The Mother digs around in her
parka pocket and comes up with a Kleenex. It is old and thin, like a
mashed flower saved from a dance; she dabs it at her eyes and nose.</p>
<p>“The baby won’t suffer as much as you,” says the Surgeon.</p>
<p>And who can contradict? Not the Baby, who in his Slavic Betty Boop
voice can say only mama, dada, cheese, ice, bye-bye, outside,
boogie-boogie, goody-goody, eddy-eddy, and car. (Who is Eddy? They have
no idea.) This will not suffice to express his mortal suffering. Who can
say what babies do with their agony and shock? Not they themselves.
(Baby talk: isn’t it a stitch?) They put it all no place anyone can
really see. They are like a different race, a different species: they
seem not to experience pain the way we do. Yeah, that’s it: their
nervous systems are not as fully formed, and they just don’t experience
pain the way we do. A tune to keep one humming through the war. “You’ll
get through it,” the Surgeon says.</p>
<p>“How?” asks the Mother. “How does one get through it?”</p>
<p>“You just put your head down and go,” says the Surgeon. He picks up
his file folder. He is a skilled manual laborer. The tricky emotional
stuff is not to his liking. The babies. The babies! What can be said to
console the parents about the babies? “I’ll go phone the oncologist on
duty to let him know,” he says, and leaves the room.</p>
<p>“Come here, sweetie,” the Mother says to the Baby, who has toddled
off toward a gum wrapper on the floor. “We’ve got to put your jacket
on.” She picks him up and he reaches for the light switch again. Light,
dark. Peekaboo: Where’s baby? Where did baby go?</p>
<p>At home, she leaves a message—Urgent! Call me!—for the Husband on his
voice mail. Then she takes the Baby upstairs for his nap, rocks him in
the rocker. The Baby waves goodbye to his little bears, then looks
toward the window and says, “Bye-bye, outside.” He has, lately, the
habit of waving goodbye to everything, and now it seems as if he sensed
some imminent departure, and it breaks her heart to hear him. Bye-bye!
She sings low and monotonously, like a small appliance, which is how he
likes it. He is drowsy, dozy, drifting off. He has grown so much in the
last year he hardly fits in her lap anymore; his limbs dangle off like a
Pietà. His head rolls slightly inside the crook of her arm. She can feel
him falling backward into sleep, his mouth round and open like the
sweetest of poppies. All the lullabies in the world, all the melodies
threaded through with maternal melancholy now become for her—abandoned
as mothers can be by working men and napping babies—the songs of hard,
hard grief. Sitting there, bowed and bobbing, the Mother feels the
entirety of her love as worry and heartbreak. A quick and irrevocable
alchemy: there is no longer one unworried scrap left for happiness. “If
you go,” she keens low into his soapy neck, into the ranunculus coil of
his ear, “we are going with you. We are nothing without you. Without
you, we are a heap of rocks. Without you, we are two stumps, with
nothing any longer in our hearts. Wherever this takes you, we are
following; we will be there. Don’t be scared. We are going, too,
wherever you go. That is that. That is that.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>“Take notes,” says the Husband, after coming straight home from work,
midafternoon, hearing the news, and saying all the words out
loud—surgery, metastasis, dialysis, transplant—then collapsing in a
chair in tears. “Take notes. We are going to need the money.”</p>
<p>“Good God,” cries the Mother. Everything inside her suddenly begins
to cower and shrink, a thinning of bones. Perhaps this is a soldier’s
readiness, but it has the whiff of death and defeat. It feels like a
heart attack, a failure of will and courage, a power failure: a failure
of everything. Her face, when she glimpses it in a mirror, is cold and
bloated with shock, her eyes scarlet and shrunk. She has already started
to wear sunglasses indoors, like a celebrity widow. From where will her
own strength come? From some philosophy? From some frigid little
philosophy? She is neither stalwart nor realistic and has trouble with
basic concepts, such as the one that says events move in one direction
only and do not jump up, turn around, and take themselves back.</p>
<p>The Husband begins too many of his sentences with “What if.” He is
trying to piece everything together, like a train wreck. He is trying to
get the train to town.</p>
<p>“We’ll just take all the steps, move through all the stages. We’ll go
where we have to go, we’ll hunt, we’ll find, we’ll pay what we have to
pay. What if we can’t pay?”</p>
<p>“Sounds like shopping.”</p>
<p>“I cannot believe this is happening to our little boy,” he says, and
starts to sob again.</p>
<p>What is to be said? You turn just slightly and there it is: the death
of your child. It is part symbol, part devil, and in your blind spot all
along, until it is upon you. Then it is a fierce little country
abducting you; it holds you squarely inside itself like a cellar room,
the best boundaries of you are the boundaries of it. Are there windows?
Sometimes aren’t there windows?</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The Mother is not a shopper. She hates to shop, is generally bad at
it, though she does like a good sale. She cannot stroll meaningfully
through anger, denial, grief, and acceptance. She goes straight to
bargaining and stays there. How much? She calls out to the ceiling, to
some makeshift construction of holiness she has desperately though not
uncreatively assembled in her mind and prayed to; a doubter, never
before given to prayer, she must now reap what she has not sown; she
must reassemble an entire altar of worship and begging. She tries for
noble abstractions, nothing too anthropomorphic, just some Higher
Morality, though if this particular Highness looks something like the
Manager at Marshall Field’s, sucking a Frango mint, so be it. Amen. Just
tell me what you want, requests the Mother. And how do you want it? More
charitable acts? A billion, starting now. Charitable thoughts? Harder,
but of course! Of course! I’ll do the cooking, honey, I’ll pay the rent.
Just tell me. Excuse me? Well, if not to you, to whom do I speak? Hello?
To whom do I have to speak around here? A higher-up? A superior? Wait? I
can wait. I’ve got the whole damn day.</p>
<p>The Husband now lies next to her on their bed, sighing. “Poor little
guy could survive all this only to be killed in a car crash at the age
of sixteen,” he says.</p>
<p>The Mother, bargaining, considers this. “We’ll take the car crash,”
she says.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Let’s Make a Deal! Sixteen is a full life! We’ll take the car crash.
We’ll take the car crash in front of which Carol Merrill is now
standing.”</p>
<p>Now the Manager of Marshall Field’s reappears. “To take the surprises
out is to take the life out of life,” he says.</p>
<p>The phone rings. The Husband leaves the room.</p>
<p>“But I don’t want these surprises,” says the Mother. “Here! You take
these surprises!”</p>
<p>“To know the narrative in advance is to turn yourself into a
machine,” the Manager continues. “What makes humans human is precisely
that they do not know the future. That is why they do the fateful and
amusing things they do: who can say how anything will turn out? Therein
lies the only hope for redemption, discovery, and—let’s be frank—fun,
fun, fun! There might be things people will get away with. And not just
motel towels. There might be great illicit loves, enduring joy—or
faith-shaking accidents with farm machinery. But you have to not know in
order to see what stories your life’s efforts bring you. The mystery is
all.”</p>
<p>The Mother, though shy, has grown confrontational. “Is this the kind
of bogus, random crap they teach at merchandising school? We would like
fewer surprises, fewer efforts and mysteries, thank you. K through 8;
can we just get K through 8?” It now seems like the luckiest, most
beautiful, most musical phrase she’s ever heard: K through 8—the very
lilt. The very thought.</p>
<p>The Manager continues, trying things out. “I mean, the whole
conception of ‘the story,’ of cause and effect, the whole idea that
people have a clue as to how the world works, is just a piece of
laughable metaphysical colonialism perpetrated upon the wild country of
time.”</p>
<p>Did they own a gun? The Mother begins looking through drawers.</p>
<p>The Husband comes back in the room and observes her. “Ha! The Great
Havoc That Is the Puzzle of All Life!” he says of the Marshall Field’s
management policy. He has just gotten off a conference call with the
insurance company and the hospital. The surgery will be Friday. “It’s
all just some dirty capitalist’s idea of a philosophy.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s just a fact of narrative, and you really can’t politicize
it,” says the Mother. It is now only the two of them.</p>
<p>“Whose side are you on?”</p>
<p>“I’m on the Baby’s side.”</p>
<p>“Are you taking notes for this?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You’re not?”</p>
<p>“No. I can’t. Not this! I write fiction. This isn’t fiction.”</p>
<p>“Then write nonfiction. Do a piece of journalism. Get two dollars a
word.”</p>
<p>“Then it has to be true and full of information. I’m not trained. I’m
not that skilled. Plus, I have a convenient personal principle about
artists’ not abandoning art. One should never turn one’s back on a vivid
imagination. Even the whole memoir thing annoys me.”</p>
<p>“Well, make things up but pretend they’re real.”</p>
<p>“I’m not that insured.”</p>
<p>“You’re making me nervous.”</p>
<p>“Sweetie, darling, I’m not that good. I can’t do this. I can do—what
can I do? I can do quasi-amusing phone dialogue. I can do succinct
descriptions of weather. I can do screwball outings with the family pet.
Sometimes I can do those. Honey, I only do what I can. I do the careful
ironies of daydream. I do the marshy ideas upon which intimate life is
built. But this? Our baby with cancer? I’m sorry. My stop was two
stations back. This is irony at its most gaudy and careless. This is a
Hieronymus Bosch of facts and figures and blood and graphs. This is a
nightmare of narrative slop. This cannot be designed. This cannot even
be noted in preparation for a design—”</p>
<p>“We’re going to need the money.”</p>
<p>“To say nothing of the moral boundaries of pecuniary recompense in a
situation such as this—”</p>
<p>“What if the other kidney goes? What if he needs a transplant? Where
are the moral boundaries there? What are we going to do, have bake
sales?”</p>
<p>“We can sell the house. I hate this house. It makes me crazy.”</p>
<p>“And we’ll live—where, again?”</p>
<p>“The Ronald McDonald place. I hear it’s nice. It’s the least
McDonald’s can do.”</p>
<p>“You have a keen sense of justice.”</p>
<p>“I try. What can I say?”</p>
<p>The Husband buries his face in his hands: “Our poor baby. How did
this happen to him?” He looks over and stares at the bookcase that
serves as their nightstand. “And is any one of these baby books a help?”
He picks up the Leach, the Spock, the “What to Expect.” “Where in the
pages or index of any of these does it say ‘chemotherapy’ or ‘Hickman
catheter’ or ‘renal sarcoma’? Where does it say ‘carcinogenesis’ or
‘metastasis’? You know what these books are obsessed with? Holding a
fucking spoon.” He begins hurling the books off the nightstand and
against the far wall.</p>
<p>“Hey,” says the Mother, trying to soothe. “Hey, hey, hey.” But,
compared with his stormy roar, her words are those of a backup singer—a
Shondell, a Pip—a doo-wop ditty. Books, and now more books, continue to
fly.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Take Notes.</p>
<p>Is “fainthearted” one word or two? Student prose has wrecked her
spelling.</p>
<p>It’s one word. Two words—faint hearted—what would that be? The name
of a drag queen.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Take Notes.</p>
<p>In the end you suffer alone. But at the beginning you suffer with a
whole lot of others. When your child has cancer you are instantly
whisked away to another planet: one of bald-headed little boys.
Pediatric Oncology. Peed-Onk. You wash your hands for thirty seconds in
antibacterial soap before you are allowed to enter through the swinging
doors. You put paper slippers on your shoes. You keep your voice down.
“Almost all the children are boys,” one of the nurses says. “No one
knows why. It’s been documented, but a lot of people out there still
don’t realize it.” The little boys are all from sweet-sounding places,
Janesville and Appleton—little heartland towns with giant landfills,
agricultural runoff, paper factories, Joe McCarthy’s grave. (Alone a
site of great toxicity, thinks the Mother. The soil should be
tested.)</p>
<p>All the bald little boys look like brothers. They wheel their I.V.s
up and down the single corridor of Peed-Onk. Some of the lively ones,
feeling good for a day, ride the lower bars of their I.V.s while their
large, cheerful mothers whizz them along the halls. Wheee!</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The Mother does not feel large and cheerful. In her mind she is
scathing, acid-tongued, wraith-thin, and chain-smoking out on a fire
escape somewhere. Below her lie the gentle undulations of the Midwest,
with all its aspirations to be—to be what? To be Long Island. How it has
succeeded! Strip mall upon strip mall. Lurid water, poisoned potatoes.
The Mother drags deeply, blowing clouds of smoke out over the disfigured
cornfields. When a baby gets cancer, it seems stupid ever to have given
up smoking. When a baby gets cancer, you think, Whom are we kidding?
Let’s all light up. When a baby gets cancer, you think, Who came up with
this idea? What celestial abandon gave rise to this? Pour me a drink, so
I can refuse to toast.</p>
<p>The Mother does not know how to be one of these other mothers, with
their blond hair and sweatpants and sneakers and determined
pleasantness. She does not think that she can be anything similar. She
does not feel remotely like them. She knows, for instance, too many
people in Greenwich Village. She mail-orders oysters and tiramisù from a
shop in SoHo. She is close friends with four actual homosexuals. Her
husband is asking her to Take Notes.</p>
<p>Where do these women get their sweatpants? She will find out.</p>
<p>She will start, perhaps, with the costume and work from there.</p>
<p>She will live according to the bromides: Take one day at a time. Take
a positive attitude. Take a hike! She wishes that there were more
interesting things that were useful and true, but it seems now that it’s
only the boring things that are useful and true. One day at a time. And
At least we have our health. How ordinary. How obvious. One day at a
time: you need a brain for that?</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>While the Surgeon is fine-boned, regal, and laconic—they have
correctly guessed his game to be doubles—there is a bit of the mad,
overcaffeinated scientist to the Oncologist. He speaks quickly. He knows
a lot of studies and numbers. He can do the math. Good! Someone should
be able to do the math! “It’s a fast but wimpy tumor,” he explains. “It
typically metastasizes to the lung.” He rattles off some numbers, time
frames, risk statistics. Fast but wimpy: the Mother tries to imagine
this combination of traits, tries to think and think, and can only come
up with Claudia Osk from the fourth grade, who blushed and almost wept
when called on in class but in gym could outrun everyone in the
quarter-mile, fire-door-to-fence dash. The Mother thinks now of this
tumor as Claudia Osk. They are going to get Claudia Osk, make her sorry.
All right! Claudia Osk must die. Though it has never been mentioned
before, it now seems clear that Claudia Osk should have died long ago.
Who was she, anyway? So conceited, not letting anyone beat her in a
race. Well, hey, hey, hey—don’t look now, Claudia!</p>
<p>The Husband nudges her. “Are you listening?”</p>
<p>“The chances of this happening even just to one kidney are one in
fifteen thousand. Now, given all these other factors, the chances on the
second kidney are about one in eight.”</p>
<p>“One in eight,” says the Husband. “Not bad. As long as it’s not one
in fifteen thousand.”</p>
<p>The Mother studies the trees and fish along the ceiling’s edge in the
Save the Planet wallpaper border. Save the Planet. Yes! But the windows
in this very building don’t open, and diesel fumes are leaking into the
ventilating system, near which, outside, a delivery truck is parked. The
air is nauseous and stale.</p>
<p>“Really,” the Oncologist is saying, “of all the cancers he could get,
this is probably one of the best.”</p>
<p>“We win,” says the Mother.</p>
<p>“ ‘Best,’ I know, hardly seems the right word. Look, you two probably
need to get some rest. We’ll see how the surgery and histology go. Then
we’ll start with chemo the week following. A little light chemo:
vincristine and—”</p>
<p>“Vincristine?” interrupts the Mother. “Wine of Christ?”</p>
<p>“The names are strange, I know. The other one we use is
actinomycin-D. Sometimes called dactinomycin. People move the ‘D’ around
to the front.”</p>
<p>“They move the ‘D’ around to the front,” repeats the Mother.</p>
<p>“Yup,” the Oncologist says. “I don’t know why, they just do!”</p>
<p>“Christ didn’t survive his wine,” says the Husband.</p>
<p>“But of course he did,” says the Oncologist and nods toward the Baby,
who has now found a cupboard full of hospital linens and bandages and is
yanking them all out onto the floor. “I’ll see you guys tomorrow, after
the surgery.” And with that the Oncologist leaves.</p>
<p>“Or, rather, Christ was his wine,” mumbles the Husband. Everything he
knows about the New Testament he has gleaned from the soundtrack of
“Godspell.” “His blood was the wine. What a great beverage idea.”</p>
<p>“A little light chemo. Don’t you like that one?” says the Mother.
“Eine kleine dactinomycin. I’d like to see Mozart write that one up for
a big wad o’ cash.”</p>
<p>“Come here, honey,” the Husband says to the Baby, who has now pulled
off both his shoes.</p>
<p>“It’s bad enough when they refer to medical science as an inexact
science,” says the Mother. “But when they start referring to it as an
art I get extremely nervous.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. If we wanted art, Doc, we’d go to an art museum.” The Husband
picks up the Baby. “You’re an artist,” he says to the Mother with the
taint of accusation in his voice. “They probably think you find
creativity reassuring.”</p>
<p>The Mother sighs. “I just find it inevitable. Let’s go get something
to eat.” And so they take the elevator to the cafeteria, where there is
a high chair, and where, not noticing, they all eat a lot of apples with
the price tags still on them.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Because his surgery is not until tomorrow, the Baby likes the
hospital. He likes the long corridors, down which he can run. He likes
everything on wheels. The flower carts in the lobby! (“Please keep your
boy away from the flowers,” says the vender. “We’ll buy the whole
display,” snaps the Mother, adding, “Actual children in a children’s
hospital—unbelievable, isn’t it?”) The Baby likes the other little boys.
Places to go! People to see! Rooms to wander into! There is Intensive
Care. There is the Trauma Unit. The Baby smiles and waves. What a little
Cancer Personality! Bandaged citizens smile and wave back. In Peed-Onk
there are the bald little boys to play with. Joey, Eric, Tim, Mort, and
Tod. (Mort! Tod!) There is the four-year-old, Ned, holding his little
deflated rubber ball, the one with the intriguing curling hose. The Baby
wants to play with it. “It’s mine, leave it alone,” says Ned. “Tell the
baby to leave it alone.”</p>
<p>“Baby, you’ve got to share,” says the Mother from a chair some feet
away.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from down near the Tiny Tim Lounge, comes Ned’s mother,
large and blond and sweatpanted. “Stop that! Stop it!” she cries out,
dashing toward the Baby and Ned and pushing the Baby away. “Don’t touch
that!” she barks at the Baby, who is only a baby and bursts into tears
because he has never been yelled at like this before.</p>
<p>Ned’s mom glares at everyone. “This is drawing fluid from Neddy’s
liver!” She pats at the rubber thing and starts to cry a little.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God,” says the Mother. She comforts the Baby, who is also
crying. She and Ned, the only dry-eyed people, look at each other. “I’m
so sorry,” she says to Ned and then to his mother. “I’m so stupid. I
thought they were squabbling over a toy.”</p>
<p>“It does look like a toy,” agrees Ned. He smiles. He is an angel. All
the little boys are angels. Total, sweet, bald little angels, and now
God is trying to get them back for himself. Who are they, mere mortal
women, in the face of this, this powerful and overwhelming and
inscrutable thing, God’s will? They are the mothers, that’s who. You
can’t have him! they shout every day. You dirty old man! Get out of
here! Hands off!</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry,” says the Mother again. “I didn’t know.”</p>
<p>Ned’s mother smiles vaguely. “Of course you didn’t know,” she says,
and walks back to the Tiny Tim Lounge.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The Tiny Tim Lounge is a little sitting area at the end of the
Peed-Onk corridor. There are two small sofas, a table, a rocking chair,
a television, and a VCR. There are various videos: “Speed,” “Dune,”
“Star Wars.” On one of the lounge walls there is a gold plaque with the
musician Tiny Tim’s name on it: years ago, his son was treated at this
hospital, and so he donated money for this lounge. It is a cramped
little lounge, which one suspects would be larger if Tiny Tim’s son had
actually lived. Instead, he died here, at this hospital, and now there
is this tiny room which is part gratitude, part generosity, part Fuck
you.</p>
<p>Sifting through the videocassettes, the Mother wonders what science
fiction could begin to compete with the science fiction of cancer
itself: a tumor, with its differentiated muscle and bone cells, a clump
of wild nothing and its mad, ambitious desire to be something—something
inside you, instead of you, another organism but with a monster’s
architecture, a demon’s sabotage and chaos. Think of leukemia, a tumor
diabolically taking liquid form, the better to swim about incognito in
the blood. George Lucas, direct that!</p>
<p>Sitting with the other parents in the Tiny Tim Lounge, the night
before the surgery, having put the Baby to bed in his high steel crib
two rooms down, the Mother begins to hear the stories: leukemia in
kindergarten, sarcomas in Little League, neuroblastomas discovered at
summer camp. Eric slid into third base, but then the scrape didn’t heal.
The parents pat one another’s forearms and speak of other children’s
hospitals as if they were resorts. “You were at St. Jude’s last winter?
So were we. What did you think of it? We loved the staff.” Jobs have
been quit, marriages hacked up, bank accounts ravaged; the parents have
seemingly endured the unendurable. They speak not of the possibility of
comas brought on by the chemo but of the number of them. “He was in his
first coma last July,” says Ned’s mother. “It was a scary time, but we
pulled through.”</p>
<p>Pulling through is what people do around here. There is a kind of
bravery in their lives that isn’t bravery at all. It is automatic,
unflinching, a mix of man and machine, consuming and unquestionable
obligation meeting illness move for move in a giant, even-Steven game of
chess: an unending round of something that looks like
shadowboxing—though between love and death, which is the shadow?
“Everyone admires us for our courage,” says one man. “They have no idea
what they’re talking about.”</p>
<p>I could get out of here, thinks the Mother. I could just get on a bus
and go, never come back. Change my name. A kind of witness-relocation
thing.</p>
<p>“Courage requires options,” the man adds.</p>
<p>The Baby might be better off.</p>
<p>“There are options,” says a woman with a thick suède headband. “You
could give up. You could fall apart.”</p>
<p>“No, you can’t. Nobody does. I’ve never seen it,” says the man.
“Well, not really fall apart.” Then the lounge is quiet. Over the VCR
someone has taped the fortune from a fortune cookie. Optimism, it says,
is what allows a teakettle to sing though up to its neck in hot water.
Underneath, someone else has taped a clipping from a summer horoscope.
Cancer rules! it says. Who would tape this up? Somebody’s
twelve-year-old brother. One of the fathers—Joey’s father—gets up and
tears them both off, makes a small wad in his fist.</p>
<p>There is some rustling of magazine pages.</p>
<p>The Mother clears her throat. “Tiny Tim forgot the wet bar,” she
says.</p>
<p>Ned, who is still up, comes out of his room and down the corridor,
whose lights dim at nine. Standing next to the Mother’s chair, he says
to her, “Where are you from? What is wrong with your baby?”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>In the little room that is theirs, she sleeps fitfully in her
sweatpants, occasionally leaping up to check on the Baby. This is what
the sweatpants are for: leaping. In case of fire. In case of anything.
In case the difference between day and night starts to dissolve and
there is no difference at all so why pretend. In the cot beside her the
Husband, who has taken a sleeping pill, is snoring loudly, his arms
folded about his head in a kind of origami. How could either of them
have stayed back at the house, with its empty high chair and empty crib?
Occasionally the Baby wakes and cries out, and she bolts up, goes to
him, rubs his back, rearranges the linens. The clock on the metal
dresser shows that it is five after three. Then twenty to five. And then
it is really morning, the beginning of this day, Nephrectomy Day. Will
she be glad when it’s over, or barely alive, or both? Each day of this
week has arrived huge, empty, and unknown, like a spaceship, and this
one especially is lit an incandescent gray.</p>
<p>“He’ll need to put this on,” says John, one of the nurses, bright and
early, handing the Mother a thin greenish garment with roses and Teddy
bears printed on it. A wave of nausea hits her: this smock, she thinks,
will soon be splattered with—with what?</p>
<p>The Baby is awake but drowsy. She lifts off his pajamas. “Don’t
forget, bubeleh,” she whispers, undressing and dressing him. “We will be
with you every moment, every step. When you think you are asleep and
floating off far away from everybody, Mommy will still be there.” If she
hasn’t fled on a bus. “Mommy will take care of you. And Daddy, too.” She
hopes the Baby does not detect her own fear and uncertainty, which she
must hide from him, like a limp. He is hungry, not having been allowed
to eat, and he is no longer amused by this new place but worried about
its hardships. Oh, my baby, she thinks. And the room starts to swim a
little. The Husband comes in to take over. “Take a break,” he says to
her. “I’ll walk him around for five minutes.”</p>
<p>She leaves but doesn’t know where to go. In the hallway she is
approached by a kind of social worker, a customer-relations person, who
had given them a video to watch about the anesthesia: how the parent
accompanies the child into the operating room, and how gently, nicely
the drugs are administered.</p>
<p>“Did you watch the video?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” says the Mother.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it helpful?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” says the Mother.</p>
<p>“Do you have any questions?” asks the video woman. Do you have any
questions? asked of someone who has recently landed in this fearful,
alien place seems to the Mother an absurd and amazing little courtesy.
The very specificity of a question would give the lie to the
overwhelming strangeness of everything around her.</p>
<p>“Not right now,” says the Mother. “Right now I think I’m just going
to go to the bathroom.”</p>
<p>When she comes back to the Baby’s room, everyone is there: the
Surgeon, the Anesthesiologist, all the nurses, the social worker. In
their blue caps and scrubs they look like a clutch of forget-me-nots,
and forget them who could? The Baby, in his little Teddy-bear smock,
seems cold and scared. He reaches out and the Mother lifts him from the
Husband’s arms, rubs his back to warm him.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s time!” says the Surgeon, forcing a smile.</p>
<p>“Shall we go?” says the Anesthesiologist.</p>
<p>What follows is a blur of obedience and bright lights. They take an
elevator down to a big concrete room, the anteroom, the greenroom, the
backstage of the operating room. Lining the walls are long shelves full
of blue surgical outfits. “Children often become afraid of the color
blue,” one of the nurses says. But of course. Of course! “Now, which one
of you would like to come into the operating room for the
anesthesia?”</p>
<p>“I will,” says the Mother.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” says the Husband.</p>
<p>“Yup.” She kisses the Baby’s hair. Mr. Curlyhead people keep calling
him here, and it seems both rude and nice. Women look admiringly at his
long lashes and exclaim, “Always the boys! Always the boys!”</p>
<p>Two surgical nurses put a blue smock and a blue cotton cap on the
Mother. The Baby finds this funny and keeps pulling at the cap. “This
way,” says another nurse, and the Mother follows. “Just put the Baby
down on the table.”</p>
<p>In the video, the mother holds the baby and fumes from the mask are
gently waved under the baby’s nose until he falls asleep. Now, out of
view of camera or social worker, the Anesthesiologist is anxious to get
this under way and not let too much gas leak out into the room
generally. The occupational hazard of this, his chosen profession, is
gas exposure and nerve damage, and it has started to worry him. No doubt
he frets about it to his wife every night. Now he turns the gas on and
quickly clamps the plastic mouthpiece over the Baby’s cheeks and
lips.</p>
<p>The Baby is startled. The Mother is startled. The Baby starts to
scream and redden behind the plastic, but he cannot be heard. He
thrashes. “Tell him it’s O.K.,” says the nurse to the Mother.</p>
<p>O.K.? “It’s O.K.,” repeats the Mother, holding his hand, but she
knows he can tell it’s not O.K., because he can see that not only is she
still wearing that stupid paper cap but her words are mechanical and
swallowed, and she is biting her lips to keep them from trembling.
Panicked, he attempts to sit, he cannot breathe, his arms reach up.
Bye-bye, outside. And then, quite quickly, his eyes shut, he untenses
and has fallen not into sleep but aside to sleep, an odd, kidnapping
kind of sleep, his terror now hidden someplace deep inside him.</p>
<p>“How did it go?” asks the social worker, waiting in the concrete
outer room. The Mother is hysterical. A nurse has ushered her out.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t at all like the film strip!” she cries. “It wasn’t like
the film strip at all!”</p>
<p>“The film strip? You mean the video?” asks the social worker.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t like that at all! It was brutal and unforgivable.”</p>
<p>“Why, that’s terrible,” she says, her role now no longer
misinformational but janitorial, and she touches the Mother’s arm. The
Mother shakes her off and goes to find the Husband.</p>
<p>She finds him in the large mulberry Surgery Lounge, where he has been
taken and where there is free hot chocolate in small plastic-foam cups.
Red cellophane garlands festoon the doorways. She has totally forgotten
it is as close to Christmas as this. A pianist in the corner is playing
“Carol of the Bells,” and it sounds not only unfestive but scary, like
the theme from “The Exorcist.”</p>
<p>There is a giant clock on the far wall. It is a kind of porthole into
the operating room, a way of assessing the Baby’s ordeal: forty-five
minutes for the Hickman implant; two and a half hours for the
nephrectomy. And then, after that, three months of chemotherapy. The
magazine on her lap stays open at a ruby-hued perfume ad.</p>
<p>“Still not taking notes,” says the Husband.</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“You know, in a way, this is the kind of thing you’ve always written
about.”</p>
<p>“You are really something, you know that? This is life. This isn’t a
‘kind of thing.’ ”</p>
<p>“But this is the kind of thing that fiction is: it’s the unlivable
life, the strange room tacked on to the house, the extra moon that is
circling the earth unbeknownst to science.”</p>
<p>“I told you that.”</p>
<p>“I’m quoting you.”</p>
<p>She looks at her watch, thinking of the Baby. “How long has it
been?”</p>
<p>“Not long. Too long. In the end, those’re the same things.”</p>
<p>“What do you suppose is happening to him right this second?”</p>
<p>Infection? Slipping knives? “I don’t know. But you know what? I’ve
gotta go. I’ve gotta just walk a bit.” The Husband gets up, walks around
the lounge, then comes back and sits down.</p>
<p>The synapses between the minutes are unswimmable. An hour is thick as
fudge. The Mother feels depleted; she is a string of empty tin cans
attached by wire, something a goat would sniff and chew, something now
and then enlivened by a jolt of electricity.</p>
<p>She hears their names being called over the intercom. “Yes? Yes?” She
stands up quickly. Her voice has flown out before her, an exhalation of
birds. The piano music has stopped. The pianist is gone. She and the
Husband approach the main desk, where a man looks up at them and smiles.
Before him is a Xeroxed list of patients’ names. “That’s our little boy
right there,” says the Mother, seeing the Baby’s name on the list and
pointing at it. “Is there some word? Is everything O.K.?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” says the man. “Your boy is doing fine. They’ve just finished
with the catheter and they are moving on to the kidney.”</p>
<p>“But it’s been two hours already! Oh, my God, did something go wrong,
what happened, what went wrong?”</p>
<p>“Did something go wrong?” The Husband tugs at his collar.</p>
<p>“Not really. It just took longer than they expected. I’m told
everything is fine. They wanted you to know.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” says the Husband. They turn and walk back toward where
they were sitting.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to make it,” sighs the Mother, sinking into a
fake-leather chair shaped somewhat like a baseball mitt. “But before I
go I’m taking half this hospital out with me.”</p>
<p>“Do you want some coffee?” asks the Husband.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” says the Mother. “No, I guess not. No. Do you?”</p>
<p>“Nah, I don’t, either, I guess,” he says.</p>
<p>“Would you like part of an orange?”</p>
<p>“Oh, maybe, I guess, if you’re having one.” She takes a temple orange
from her purse and just sits there peeling its difficult skin, the flesh
rupturing beneath her fingers, the juice trickling down her hands,
stinging the hangnails. She and the Husband chew and swallow, discreetly
spit the seeds into Kleenex, and read from photocopies of the latest
medical research which they begged from the interne. They read, and
underline, and sigh and close their eyes, and after some time the
surgery is over. A nurse from Peed-Onk comes down to tell them.</p>
<p>“Your little boy’s in recovery right now. He’s doing well. You can
see him in about fifteen minutes.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>How can it be described? How can any of it be described? The trip and
the story of the trip are always two different things. The narrator is
the one who has stayed home but then, afterward, presses her mouth upon
the traveller’s mouth, in order to make the mouth work, to make the
mouth say, say, say. One cannot go to a place and speak of it, one
cannot both see and say, not really. One can go, and upon returning make
a lot of hand motions and indications with the arms. The mouth itself,
working at the speed of light, at the eye’s instructions, is necessarily
struck still; so fast, so much to report, it hangs open and dumb as a
gutted bell. All that unsayable life! That’s where the narrator comes
in. The narrator comes with her kisses and mimicry and tidying up. The
narrator comes and makes a slow, fake song of the mouth’s eager
devastation.</p>
<p>It is a horror and a miracle to see him. He is lying in his crib in
his room, tubed up, splayed like a boy on a cross, his arms stiffened
into cardboard “no-no”s so that he cannot yank out the tubes. There is
the bladder catheter, the nasal-gastric tube, and the Hickman, which,
beneath the skin, is plugged into his jugular, then popped out his chest
wall and capped with a long plastic cap. There is a large bandage taped
over his abdomen. Groggy, on a morphine drip, still he is able to look
at her when, maneuvering through all the vinyl wiring, she leans to hold
him, and when she does he begins to cry, but cry silently, without
motion or noise. She has never seen a baby cry without motion or noise.
It is the crying of an old person: silent, beyond opinion, shattered. In
someone so tiny, it is frightening and unnatural. She wants to pick up
the Baby and run—out of there, out of there. She wants to whip out a
gun: No-nos, eh? This whole thing is what I call a no-no. “Don’t you
touch him!” she wants to shout at the surgeons and the needle nurses.
“Not anymore! No more! No more!” She would crawl up and lie beside him
in the crib if she could. But instead, because of all his intricate
wiring, she must lean and cuddle, sing to him, songs of peril and
flight: “We gotta get out of this place, if it’s the last thing we ever
do. We gotta get out of this place. Baby, there’s a better life for me
and for you.”</p>
<p>Very 1967. She was eleven then, and impressionable.</p>
<p>The Baby looks at her, pleadingly, his arms outstretched in
surrender. To where? Where is there to go? Take me! Take me!</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>That night, post-op night, the Mother and the Husband lie afloat in
their cots. A fluorescent lamp near the crib is kept on in the dark. The
Baby breathes evenly but thinly in his drugged sleep. The morphine in
its first flooding doses apparently makes him feel as if he were falling
backward—or so the Mother has been told—and it causes the Baby to jerk,
to catch himself over and over, as if he were being dropped from a tree.
“Is this right? Isn’t there something that should be done?” The nurses
come in hourly, different ones—the night shifts seem strangely short and
frequent. If the Baby stirs or frets, the nurses give him more morphine
through the Hickman catheter, then leave to tend to other patients. The
Mother rises to check on him herself in the low light. There is gurgling
from the clear plastic suction tube coming out of his mouth. Brownish
clumps have collected in the tube. What is going on? The Mother rings
for the nurse. Is it Renee or Sarah or Darcy? She’s forgotten.</p>
<p>“What, what is it?” murmurs the Husband, waking up.</p>
<p>“Something is wrong,” says the Mother. “It looks like blood in his
N-G tube.”</p>
<p>“What?” The Husband gets out of bed. He, too, is wearing
sweatpants.</p>
<p>The nurse—Valerie—pushes open the heavy door to the room and enters
quietly. “Everything O.K.?”</p>
<p>“There’s something wrong here. The tube is sucking blood out of his
stomach. It looks like it may have perforated his stomach and now he’s
bleeding internally. Look!”</p>
<p>Valerie is a saint, but her voice is the standard hospital saint
voice: an infuriating, pharmaceutical calm. It says, Everything is
normal here. Death is normal. Pain is normal. Nothing is abnormal. So
there is nothing to get excited about. “Well, now, let’s see.” She holds
up the plastic tube and tries to see inside it. “Hmm,” she says. “I’ll
call the attending physician.”</p>
<p>Because this is a research and teaching hospital, all the regular
doctors are at home sleeping in their Mission-style beds. Tonight, as is
apparently the case every weekend night, the attending physician is a
medical student. He looks fifteen. The authority he attempts to convey
he cannot remotely inhabit. He is not even in the same building with it.
He shakes everyone’s hand, then strokes his chin, a gesture no doubt
gleaned from some piece of dinner theatre his parents took him to once.
As if there were an actual beard on that chin! As if beard growth on
that chin were even possible! “Our Town”! “Kiss Me Kate”! “Barefoot in
the Park”! He is attempting to convince if not to impress.</p>
<p>“We’re in trouble,” the Mother whispers to the Husband. She is tired,
tired of young people grubbing for grades. “We’ve got Dr. ‘Kiss Me Kate’
here.”</p>
<p>The Husband looks at her blankly, a mixture of disorientation and
divorce.</p>
<p>The medical student holds the tubing in his hands. “I don’t really
see anything,” he says.</p>
<p>He flunks! “You don’t?” The Mother shoves her way in, holds the clear
tubing in both hands. “That,” she says. “Right here and here.” Just this
past semester she said to one of her own students, “If you don’t see how
this essay is better than that one, then I want you to just go out into
the hallway and stand there until you do.” Is it important to keep one’s
voice down? The Baby stays asleep. He is drugged and dreaming, far
away.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” says the medical student. “Perhaps there’s a little irritation
in the stomach.”</p>
<p>“A little irritation?” The Mother grows furious. “This is blood.
These are clumps and clots. This stupid thing is sucking the life right
out of him!” Life! She is starting to cry.</p>
<p>They turn off the suction and bring in antacids, which they feed into
the Baby through the tube. Then they turn the suction on again. This
time on “low.”</p>
<p>“What was it on before?” asks the Husband.</p>
<p>“High,” says Valerie. “Doctor’s orders, though I don’t know why. I
don’t know why these doctors do a lot of the things they do.”</p>
<p>“Maybe they’re—not all that bright?” suggests the Mother. She is
feeling relief and rage simultaneously: there is a feeling of prayer and
litigation in the air. Yet essentially she is grateful. Isn’t she? She
thinks she is. And still, and still: look at all the things you have to
do to protect a child, a hospital merely an intensification of life’s
cruel obstacle course.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The Surgeon comes to visit on Saturday morning. He steps in and nods
at the Baby, who is awake but glazed from the morphine, his eyes two
dark, unseeing grapes. “The boy looks fine,” he announces. He peeks
under the Baby’s bandage. “The stitches look good,” he says. The Baby’s
abdomen is stitched all the way across, like a baseball. “And the other
kidney, when we looked at it yesterday face to face, looked fine. We’ll
try to wean him off the morphine a little, and see how he’s doing on
Monday.”</p>
<p>“Is he going to be O.K.?”</p>
<p>“The boy? The boy is going to be fine,” he says, then taps her
stiffly on the shoulder. “Now, you take care. It’s Saturday. Drink a
little wine.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Over the weekend, while the Baby sleeps, the Mother and the Husband
sit together in the Tiny Tim Lounge. The Husband is restless and makes
cafeteria and sundry runs, running errands for everyone. In his absence,
the other parents regale her further with their sagas. Pediatric cancer
and chemo stories: the children’s amputations, blood poisoning, teeth
flaking like shale, the learning delays and disabilities caused by chemo
frying the young, budding brain. But strangely optimistic codas are
tacked on: endings as stiff and loopy as carpenter’s lace, crisp and
empty as lettuce, reticulate as a net—ah, words. “After all that
business with the tutor, he’s better now, and fitted with new incisors
by my wife’s cousin’s husband, who did dental school in two and a half
years, if you can believe that. We hope for the best. We take things as
they come. Life is hard.”</p>
<p>“Life’s a big problem,” agrees the Mother. Part of her welcomes and
invites all their tales. In the few long days since this nightmare
began, part of her has become addicted to disaster and war stories. She
only wants to hear about the sadness and emergencies of others. They are
the only situations that can join hands with her own; everything else
bounces off her shiny shield of resentment and unsympathy. Nothing else
can even stay in her brain. From this, no doubt, the philistine world is
made, or should one say recruited? Together the parents huddle all day
in the Tiny Tim Lounge—no need to watch “Oprah.” They leave “Oprah” in
the dust. “Oprah” has nothing on them. They chat matter-of-factly, then
fall silent and watch “Dune” or “Star Wars,” in which there are bright
and shiny robots, whom the Mother now sees not as robots at all but as
human beings who have had terrible things happen to them.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Some of their friends visit with stuffed animals and soft “Looking
good”s for the dozing baby, though the room is way past the
stuffed-animal limit. The Mother arranges, once more, a plateful of Mint
Milano cookies and cups of takeout coffee for guests. All her nutso pals
stop by—the two on Prozac, the one obsessed with the word “penis” in the
word “happiness,” the one who recently had her hair foiled green. “Your
friends put the de in fin de siècle,” says the Husband. Overheard, or
recorded, all marital conversation sounds as if someone must be joking,
though usually no one is.</p>
<p>She loves her friends, especially loves them for coming, since there
are times they all fight and don’t speak for weeks. Is this friendship?
For now and here, it must do and is, and is, she swears it is. For one,
they never offer impromptu spiritual lectures about death, how it is
part of life, its natural ebb and flow, how we all must accept that, or
other such utterances that make her want to scratch out somebody’s eyes.
Like true friends, they take no hardy or elegant stance loosely
choreographed from some broad perspective. They get right in there and
mutter “Jesus Christ!” and shake their heads. Plus, they are the only
people who will not only laugh at her stupid jokes but offer up stupid
ones of their own. What do you get when you cross Tiny Tim with a pit
bull? A child’s illness is a strain on the mind. They know how to laugh
in a flutey, desperate way—unlike the people who are more her husband’s
friends and who seem just to deepen their sorrowful gazes, nodding their
heads in Sympathy. How Exiling and Estranging are everybody’s
Sympathetic Expressions! When anyone laughs, she thinks, O.K. Hooray! A
buddy. In disaster as in show business.</p>
<p>Nurses come and go; their chirpy voices both startle and soothe. Some
of the other Peed-Onk parents stick their heads in to see how the Baby
is and offer encouragement.</p>
<p>Green Hair scratches her head: “Everyone’s so friendly here. Is there
someone in this place who isn’t doing all this airy, scripted
optimism—or are people like that the only people here?”</p>
<p>“It’s Modern Middle Medicine meets the Modern Middle Family,” says
the Husband. “In the Modern Middle West.”</p>
<p>Someone has brought in takeout lo mein, and they all eat it out in
the hall by the elevators.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Parents are allowed use of the Courtesy Line.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to have a second child,” says a friend on the phone, a
friend from out of town. “An heir and a spare. That’s what we did. We
had another child to insure we wouldn’t off ourselves if we lost our
first.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“I’m serious.”</p>
<p>“A formal suicide? Wouldn’t you just drink yourself into a lifelong
stupor and let it go at that?”</p>
<p>“Nope. I knew how I would do it even. For a while, until our second
came along, I had it all planned.”</p>
<p>“You did? What did you plan?”</p>
<p>“I can’t go into too much detail, because—hi, honey!—the kids are
here now in the room. But I’ll spell out the general idea: R-O-P-E.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Sunday evening she goes and sinks down on the sofa in the Tiny Tim
Lounge next to Frank, Joey’s father. He is a short, stocky man with the
currentless, flat-lined look behind the eyes that all the parents
eventually get here. He has shaved his head bald in solidarity with his
son. His little boy has been battling cancer for five years. It is now
in the liver, and the rumor around the corridor is that Joey has three
weeks to live. She knows that Joey’s mother, Roseanne, left Frank years
ago, two years into the cancer, and has remarried and had another child,
a girl named Brittany. The Mother sees Roseanne here sometimes with her
new life—the cute little girl and the new full-haired husband, who will
never be so maniacally and debilitatingly obsessed with Joey’s illness
the way Frank, her first husband, is. Roseanne comes to visit Joey, to
say hello and now goodbye, but she is not Joey’s main man. Frank is.</p>
<p>Frank is full of stories—about the doctors, about the food, about the
nurses, about Joey. Joey, affectless from his meds, sometimes leaves his
room and comes out to watch TV in his bathrobe. He is jaundiced and
bald, and though he is nine he looks no older than six. Frank has
devoted the last four and a half years to saving Joey’s life. When the
cancer was first diagnosed, the doctors gave Joey a twenty-per-cent
chance of living six more months. Now here it is almost five years
later, and Joey’s still here. It is all due to Frank, who, early on,
quit his job as vice-president of a consulting firm in order to commit
himself totally to his son. He is proud of everything he’s given up and
done, but he is tired. Part of him now really believes that things are
coming to a close, that this is the end. He says this without tears.
There are no more tears.</p>
<p>“You have probably been through more than anyone else on this
corridor,” says the Mother.</p>
<p>“I could tell you stories,” he says. There is a sour odor between
them, and she realizes that neither of them has bathed for days.</p>
<p>“Tell me one. Tell me the worst one.” She knows he hates his ex-wife
and hates her new husband even more.</p>
<p>“The worst? They’re all the worst. Here’s one: one morning I went out
for breakfast with my buddy—it was the only time I’d left Joey alone
ever, left him for two hours is all—and when I came back his N-G tube
was full of blood. They had the suction on too high, and it was sucking
the guts right out of him.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my God. That just happened to us,” said the Mother.</p>
<p>“It did?”</p>
<p>“Friday night.”</p>
<p>“You’re kidding. They let that happen again? I gave them such a
chewing out about that!”</p>
<p>“I guess our luck is not so good. We get your very worst story on the
second night we’re here.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a bad place, though.”</p>
<p>“It’s not?”</p>
<p>“Naw. I’ve seen worse. I’ve taken Joey everywhere.”</p>
<p>“He seems very strong.” Truth is, at this point Joey seems like a
zombie and frightens her.</p>
<p>“Joey’s a fucking genius. A biological genius. They’d given him six
months, remember.”</p>
<p>The Mother nods.</p>
<p>“Six months is not very long,” says Frank. “Six months is nothing. He
was four and a half years old.”</p>
<p>All the words are like blows. She feels flooded with affection and
mourning for this man. She looks away, out the window, out past the
hospital parking lot, up toward the black marbled sky and the electric
eyelash of the moon. “And now he’s nine,” she says. “You’re his
hero.”</p>
<p>“And he’s mine,” says Frank, though the fatigue in his voice seems to
overwhelm him. “He’ll be that forever. Excuse me,” he says. “I’ve got to
go check. His breathing hasn’t been good. Excuse me.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>“Good news and bad,” says the Oncologist on Monday. He has knocked,
entered the room, and now stands there. Their cots are unmade. One
wastebasket is overflowing with coffee cups. “We’ve got the
pathologist’s report. The bad news is that the kidney they removed had
certain lesions, called ‘rests,’ which are associated with a higher risk
for disease in the other kidney. The good news is that the tumor is
Stage I, regular cell structure, and under five hundred grams, which
qualifies you for a national experiment in which chemotherapy isn’t done
but your boy is simply monitored with ultrasound. It’s not all that
risky, given that the patient’s watched closely, but here is the
literature on it. There are forms to sign, if you decide to do that.
Read all this and we can discuss it further. You have to decide within
four days.”</p>
<p>Lesions? Rests? They dry up and scatter like MandandandandM’s on the
floor. All she hears is the part about no chemo. Another sigh of relief
rises up in her and spills out. In a life where there is only the
bearable and the unbearable, a sigh of relief is an ecstasy.</p>
<p>“No chemo?” says the husband. “Do you recommend that?”</p>
<p>The Oncologist shrugs. What casual gestures these doctors are
permitted! “I know chemo. I like chemo,” says the Oncologist. “But this
is for you to decide. It depends how you feel.”</p>
<p>The Husband leans forward. “But don’t you think that now that we have
the upper hand with this thing we should keep going? Shouldn’t we stomp
on it, beat it, smash it to death with the chemo?”</p>
<p>The Mother swats him angrily and hard. “Honey, you’re delirious!” She
whispers, but it comes out as a hiss. “This is our lucky break.” Then
she adds gently, “We don’t want the Baby to have chemo.”</p>
<p>The Husband turns back to the Oncologist. “What do you think?”</p>
<p>“It could be,” he says, shrugging. “It could be that this is your
lucky break. But you won’t know for sure for five years.”</p>
<p>The Husband turns back to the Mother. “O.K.,” he says. “O.K.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The Baby grows happier and strong. He begins to move and sit and eat.
Wednesday morning they are allowed to leave, and to leave without chemo.
The Oncologist looks a little nervous. “Are you nervous about this?”
asks the Mother.</p>
<p>“Of course I’m nervous.” But he shrugs and doesn’t look that nervous.
“See you in six weeks for the ultrasound,” he says, then he waves and
leaves, looking at his big black shoes.</p>
<p>The Baby smiles, even toddles around a little, the sun bursting
through the clouds, an angel chorus crescendoing. Nurses arrive. The
Hickman is taken out of the Baby’s neck and chest, antibiotic lotion is
dispensed. The Mother packs up their bags. The baby sucks on a bottle of
juice and does not cry.</p>
<p>“No chemo?” says one of the nurses. “Not even a little chemo?”</p>
<p>“We’re doing watch-and-wait,” says the Mother.</p>
<p>The other parents look envious but concerned. They have never seen
any child get out of there with his hair and white blood cells
intact.</p>
<p>“Will you be O.K.?” says Ned’s mother.</p>
<p>“The worry’s going to kill us,” says the Husband.</p>
<p>“But if all we have to do is worry,” chides the Mother, “every day
for a hundred years, it’ll be easy. It’ll be nothing. I’ll take all the
worry in the world if it wards off the thing itself.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” says Ned’s mother. “Compared to everything else,
compared to all the actual events, the worry is nothing.”</p>
<p>The Husband shakes his head. “I’m such an amateur,” he moans.</p>
<p>“You’re both doing admirably,” says the other mother. “Your baby’s
lucky, and I wish you all the best.”</p>
<p>The Husband shakes her hand warmly. “Thank you,” he says. “You’ve
been wonderful.”</p>
<p>Another mother, the mother of Eric, comes up to them. “It’s all very
hard,” she says, her head cocked to one side. “But there’s a lot of
collateral beauty along the way.”</p>
<p>Collateral beauty? Who is entitled to such a thing? A child is
ill. No one is entitled to any collateral beauty.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” says the Husband.</p>
<p>Joey’s father, Frank, comes up and embraces them both. “It’s a
journey,” he says. He chucks the Baby on the chin. “Good luck, little
man.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you so much,” says the Mother. “We hope things go well
with Joey.” She knows that Joey had a hard, terrible night.</p>
<p>Frank shrugs and steps back. “Gotta go,” he says. “Goodbye!”</p>
<p>“Bye,” she says, and then he is gone. She bites the inside of her
lip, a bit tearily, then bends down to pick up the diaper bag, which is
now stuffed with little animals; helium balloons are tied to its zipper.
Shouldering the thing, the Mother feels she has just won a prize. All
the parents have now vanished down the hall in the opposite direction.
The Husband moves close. With one arm he takes the Baby from her; with
the other he rubs her back. He can see she is starting to get weepy.</p>
<p>“Aren’t these people nice? Don’t you feel better hearing about their
lives?” he asks.</p>
<p>Why does he do this, form clubs all the time—why does even this
society of suffering soothe him? When it comes to death and dying,
perhaps someone in this family ought to be more of a snob.</p>
<p>“All these nice people with their brave stories,” he continues as
they make their way toward the elevator bank, waving goodbye to the
nursing staff as they go, even the Baby waving shyly. Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
“Don’t you feel consoled, knowing we’re all in the same boat, that we’re
all in this together?”</p>
<p>But who on earth would want to be in this boat? the Mother thinks.
This boat is a nightmare boat. Look where it goes: to a silver-and-white
room, where, just before your eyesight and hearing and your ability to
touch or be touched disappear entirely, you must watch your child
die.</p>
<p>Rope! Bring on the rope.</p>
<p>“Let’s make our own way,” says the Mother, “and not in this
boat.”</p>
<p>Woman Overboard! She takes the Baby back from the Husband, cups the
Baby’s cheek in her hand, kisses his brow and then, quickly, his flowery
mouth. The Baby’s heart—she can hear it—drums with life. “For as long as
I live,” says the Mother, pressing the elevator button—up or down,
everyone in the end has to leave this way—“I never want to see any of
these people again.”</p>
