<h4 id="the-ladder">The Ladder</h4>
<p>By V. S. Pritchett (1949)</p>
<p>“We had the builders in at the time,” my father says in his accurate
way, if he ever mentions his second marriage, the one that so quickly
went wrong. “And,” he says, clearing a small apology from his throat, as
though preparing to say something immodest, “we happened to be without
stairs.”</p>
<p>It is true. I remember that summer. I was fifteen years old. I came
home from Miss Compton’s School at the end of the term, and when I got
to our place in Devonshire not only had my mother gone but the stairs
had gone, too. There was no staircase in the house.</p>
<p>We lived in an old crab-colored cottage, with long windows under the
eaves that looked like eyes half closed against the sun. Now, when I got
out of the car, I saw scaffolding over the front door and two heaps of
sand and mortar on the crazy paving, which my father asked me not to
tread in, because it would “make work for Janey.” (This was the name he
called his second wife.) I went inside. Imagine my astonishment. The
little hall had vanished, the ceiling had gone; you could see up to the
roof; the wall on one side had been stripped to the brick, and on the
other hung a long curtain of builder’s sheets. “Where are the stairs?” I
said. “What have you done with the stairs?” I was at the laughing
age.</p>
<p>A mild, trim voice spoke above our heads. “Ah, I know that laugh,”
the voice said sweetly and archly. There was Miss Richards, or, I should
say, my father’s second wife, standing behind a builder’s rope on what
used to be the landing, which now stuck out precariously without
banisters, like the portion of a ship’s deck. The floor appeared to have
been sawed off. She used to be my father’s secretary before the divorce,
and I had often seen her in my father’s office, but now she had changed.
Her fair hair was now fluffed out, and she wore a fussed and shiny brown
dress that was quite unsuitable for the country. The only definite idea
of what marriage would be like must have come to her from magazines; my
father was a successful man, and she supposed she would always be going
to cocktail parties, and at twelve in the morning on went the dress.</p>
<p>I remember how odd they both looked, she up above and my father down
below, and both apologizing to me. The builders had taken the old
staircase out two days before, they said, and had promised to put the
new one in against the far wall of the room, behind the dust sheets,
before I got back from school. But they had not kept their promise.</p>
<p>“We go up by the ladder,” said my father, cutting his wife short, for
she was apologizing too much, as if she were speaking to one of his
customers.</p>
<p>He pointed. At that moment, his wife was stepping to the end of the
landing, where a short ladder, with a post to hold on to at the top as
one stepped on the first rung, sloped to the ground.</p>
<p>“It’s horrible!” called my stepmother.</p>
<p>My father and I watched her come down. She came to the post and
turned round, not sure whether she ought to come down the ladder
frontward or backward.</p>
<p>“Backward!” called my father…“No, the other hand on the post!” My
stepmother blushed fondly and gave him a look of fear. She put one foot
on the top rung and then took her foot back and put the other one there,
and then pouted. It was only eight feet from the ground; at school, we
climbed halfway up the gym walls on the bars. I remembered her as a
quick and practical woman at the office; she was now, I was sure,
playing at being weak and dependent.</p>
<p>“My hands,” she said a moment later, looking at the dust on her hands
as she grasped the top rung.</p>
<p>My father and I stopped where we were and watched her. She put one
leg out too high, as if, artlessly, she were showing us the leg first.
And she was; she was a plain woman, and her legs (she used to say) were
her “nicest thing.” This was the only coquetry she had. She looked like
one of those insects that try the air around them with their feelers
before they move. I was surprised that my father (who had always been
formally attentive to my mother, especially when he was angry, and had
almost bowed to me when he met me at the station and helped me in and
out of the car) did not go to help her. I saw an expression of obstinacy
on his face.</p>
<p>“You’re at the bottom,” he said at last. “Only two more steps.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear,” said my stepmother, getting off the last rung onto the
floor, and she turned with her small chin raised, offering us her
helplessness for admiration. She came to me and kissed me and said,
“Doesn’t she look lovely? You are growing into a woman.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said my father.</p>
<p>And, in fear of being a woman and yet pleased by what she said, I
took my father’s arm. “Is that what we have to do? Is that how we get to
bed?” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s only until Monday,” my father said.</p>
<p>They both of them looked ashamed, as though by having the stairs
removed they had done something foolish. My father tried to conceal this
by an air of modest importance. They seemed a very modest couple. Both
of them looked shorter to me since their marriage; I was rather shocked
by this. She seemed to have made him shorter. I had always thought of my
father as a dark, vain, terse man, very logical and never giving in to
anyone. He seemed much less important now his secretary was in the
house.</p>
<p>“It is easy,” I said, and I went to the ladder and was up it in a
moment.</p>
<p>“Mind!” called my stepmother.</p>
<p>But in a moment I was down again, laughing. While I was coming down,
I heard my stepmother say quietly to my father, “What legs. She is
growing.”</p>
<p>My legs and my laugh! I did not think that my father’s secretary had
the right to say anything about me. She was not my mother.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>After this, my father took me around the house. I looked behind me
once or twice as I walked. On one of my shoes was some of the sand he
had warned me about. I don’t know how it got on my shoe. It was rather
funny seeing this one sandy footmark making work for Janey wherever I
went.</p>
<p>My father took me through the dust curtains into the dining room and
then to the far wall, where the staircase was going to be.</p>
<p>“Why have you done it?” I asked. He and I were alone.</p>
<p>“The house has wanted it for years,” he said. “It ought to have been
done years ago.”</p>
<p>I did not say anything. When my mother was there, she was always
complaining about the house, saying it was poky, barbarous—I can hear
her voice now saying “Barbarous,” as if it were the name of some
terrifying and savage queen—and my father had always refused to alter
anything. Barbarous—I used to think of that word as my mother’s
name.</p>
<p>“Does Janey like it?” I asked.</p>
<p>My father hardened at this question. He seemed to be saying, “What
has it got to do with Janey?” But what he said was—and he spoke with
amusement, with a look of quiet scorn—“She liked it as it was.”</p>
<p>“I did, too,” I said.</p>
<p>I then saw—but, no, I did not really understand this at the time; it
is something I understand now I am older—that my father was not altering
the house for Janey’s sake. She hated the whole place, because my mother
had been there, but was too tired by her earlier life in his office,
fifteen years of it, too unsure of herself, to say anything. It was an
act of amends to my mother. He was punishing Janey by getting in
builders and making everyone uncomfortable and miserable; he was
creating an emotional scene with himself. He was annoying Janey with
what my mother had so maddeningly wanted and he would not give her.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>After my father had shown me the house, I said I would go and see
Janey getting lunch ready.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t do that,” he said. “It will delay her. Lunch is just
ready. Or should be.” He looked at his watch.</p>
<p>We went to the sitting room, and while we waited, I sat in the green
chair and he asked me questions about school and we went on to talk
about the holidays. But when I answered, I could see he was not
listening to me but trying to catch sounds of Janey moving in the
kitchen. Occasionally there were sounds; something gave an explosive
fizz in a hot pan, and a saucepan lid fell. This made a loud noise and
the lid spun a long time on the stone floor. The sound stopped our
talk.</p>
<p>“Janey is not used to the kitchen,” said my father. I smiled very
close to my lips. I did not want my father to see it, but he looked at
me and he smiled by accident, too. There was a sudden understanding
between us.</p>
<p>“I will go and see,” I said.</p>
<p>He raised his hand to stop me, but I went.</p>
<p>It was natural. For fifteen years, Janey had been my father’s
secretary. She had worked in an office. I remember when I went there
when I was young she used to come into the room with an earnest and
hushed air, leaning her head a little sidewise and turning three-quarter
face toward my father, at his desk, leaning forward to guess at what he
wanted. I admired the great knowledge she had of his affairs, the way
she carried letters, how quickly she picked up the telephone when it
rang, the authority of her voice. Her strength had been that she was
impersonal. She had lost that in her marriage. As his wife, she had no
behavior. When we were talking, she raised her low bosom, which had
become round and ducklike, with a sigh and smiled at my father with a
tentative, expectant fondness. After fifteen years, a life had ended;
she was resting.</p>
<p>But Janey had not lost her office behavior; that she now kept for the
kitchen. The moment I went to the kitchen, I saw her walking to the
stove, where the saucepans were throbbing too hard. She was walking
exactly as she had walked toward my father at his desk. The stove had
taken my father’s place. She went up to it with impersonal inquiry, as
if to anticipate what it wanted; she appeared to be offering a pile of
plates to be warmed as if they were a pile of letters. She seemed
baffled because it could not speak. When one of the saucepans boiled
over, she ran to it and lifted it off, suddenly and too high, in her
telephone movement; the water spilled at once. On the table beside the
stove were basins and pans she was using, and she had them all spread
out in an orderly way, like typing; she went from one to the other with
the careful look of inquiry she used to give to the things she was
filing. It was not a method suitable to a kitchen.</p>
<p>When I came in, she put down the pan she was holding and stopped
everything—as she would have done in the office—to talk to me about what
she was doing. She was very nice about my hair, which I had had cut; it
made me look older and I liked it better. But blue smoke rose behind her
as we talked. She did not notice it.</p>
<p>No, it was not the way to cook a meal.</p>
<p>I went back to my father.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to be in the way,” I said.</p>
<p>“Extraordinary,” he said, looking at his watch. “I must just go and
hurry Janey up.”</p>
<p>He was astonished that a woman so brisk in an office should be
languid and dependent in a house.</p>
<p>“She is just bringing it in,” I said. “The potatoes are ready. They
are on the table. I saw them.”</p>
<p>“On the table?” he said. “Getting cold?”</p>
<p>“On the kitchen table,” I said.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t prevent them getting cold,” he said. My father was a
sarcastic man.</p>
<p>I walked about the room humming. My father’s exasperation did not
last. It gave way to a new thing in his voice—resignation.</p>
<p>“We will wait, if you do not mind,” he said to me. “Janey is slow.
And by the way,” he said, lowering his voice a little, “I shouldn’t
mention we passed the Leonards in the road when I brought you up from
the station.”</p>
<p>I was surprised. “Not the Leonards?” I said.</p>
<p>“They were friends of your mother’s,” he said. “You are old enough to
understand. One has to be sometimes a little tactful. Janey sometimes
feels…”</p>
<p>I looked at my father. He had altered in many ways. Giving me this
secret, his small, brown eyes gave a brilliant flash, and I opened my
blue eyes very wide and gravely to receive it. He had changed. His
rough, black hair was clipped closer at the ears, and he had that
too-young look that middle-aged men sometimes have, for by certain lines
it can be seen that they are not as young as their faces. Marks like
minutes on the face of a clock showed at the corners of his eyes, his
nose, his mouth; he was much thinner; his face had hardened. He had
often been angry and sarcastic, sulking and abrupt, when my mother was
with us, but I had never seen him before, as he was now, blank-faced,
ironical, and set in impatient boredom. After he spoke, he had actually
been hissing a tune privately through his teeth at the corner of his
mouth.</p>
<p>At this moment, Janey came in smiling too much and said lunch was
ready.</p>
<p>“Oh,” I laughed when we got into the dining room, “it is like—it is
like France.”</p>
<p>“France?” they said together, smiling at me.</p>
<p>“Like when we all went to France before the war and you took the
car,” I said. I had chosen France because that seemed as far as I could
get from the Leonards.</p>
<p>“What on earth are you talking about?” said my father, looking
embarrassed. “You were only five before the war.”</p>
<p>“I remember every bit of it. You and Mummie on the boat.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes,” said my stepmother with melancholy importance. “I got the
tickets for you all.”</p>
<p>My father looked as though he were going to hit me. Then he gave a
tolerant laugh across the table to my stepmother.</p>
<p>“I remember perfectly well,” she said. “I’m afraid I couldn’t get the
peas to boil. Oh, I’ve forgotten the potatoes.”</p>
<p>She looked as though she were going to cry. I went to get them. When
I came back, I could see she had been crying. She was one of those very
fair women, and even two or three tears brought a pinkness to her nose.
My father had said something to her sharply, for his face was shut and
hard and she was leaning over the dishes, a spoon in her hand, to
conceal a wound.</p>
<p>After lunch, I took my suitcase and went up the ladder. It was not
easy to go up carrying a suitcase, but I enjoyed it. I wished we could
always have a ladder in the house. It was like being on a ship. I stood
at the top thinking of my mother leaning on the rail of the ship with
her new husband, going to America. I was glad she had gone, because
sometimes she sent me lovely things and she had promised me that I
should go to America, too.</p>
<p>Then I went to my room and I unpacked my case. At the bottom, when I
took my pajamas out—they were the last thing—there was the photograph of
my mother, face downward, where it had been lying all the term. I forgot
to say that I had been in trouble the last week at school. I don’t know
why. I was longing to be home. I felt I had to do something. One
afternoon, I went into the rooms in our passage when no one was there,
and I put the snap of Kitty’s father into Mary’s room—I took it out of
the frame—and I put Mary’s brother into Olga’s, and I took Maeve’s
mother and put her into the silver frame where Jessie’s mother was; that
photograph was too big and I bent the mount all the way down to get it
in. Maeve cried and reported me to Miss Compton. “It was only a joke,” I
said. “A joke in very poor teeste,” Miss Compton said to me in her
voice. “How would you like it if anyone took the photograph of your
mother?” “I haven’t got one,” I said. Well, it was not a lie. Everyone
wanted to know why I had an empty frame on my chest of drawers. I had
punished my mother by leaving her photograph in my suitcase.</p>
<p>But now the punishment was over. I took out her picture and put it in
the frame on my chest, and every time I bent up from the drawers, I
looked at her, then at myself in the mirror. In the middle of this, my
stepmother came in to ask if she could help me.</p>
<p>“You are getting very pretty,” she said.</p>
<p>I hated her for admiring me. I do not deny it; I hated her. She was a
foolish woman. She either behaved as if the house, my father, and myself
were too much hers or as if she were an outsider. Most of the time, she
sat there like a visitor, waiting for attention.</p>
<p>I thought: There is my mother, thousands of miles away, leaving us to
this and treating us like dirt, and we are left with Miss Richards, of
all people.</p>
<p>That night, after I had gone to bed, I heard my father and my
stepmother having a quarrel. “It is perfectly natural for the child to
have a photograph of her mother,” I heard my father say.</p>
<p>A door closed. Someone was wandering about on the landing. When
whoever it was had gone, I opened my door and crept out, barefoot, to
listen. Every step I made seemed to start a loud creak in the boards,
and I was so concerned with this that I did not notice I had walked to
the edge of the landing. The rope was there, but in the dark I could not
see it. I knew I was on the edge of the drop into the hall and that with
one more step I would have gone through. I went back to my room feeling
sick. And then the thought struck me and I could not get it out of my
head all night. I dreamed it, I tried not to dream it; I turned on the
light, but I dreamed it again—that Miss Richards fell over the edge of
the landing. She hated me for being like my mother. I was very glad when
the morning came.</p>
<p>The moment I was downstairs, I laughed at myself. It was only eight
feet. Anyone could jump it. I worked out how I could jump from the top
and land on my feet. I moved the ladder—it was not heavy to lift—to see
what you would feel like if there was no ladder there and the house was
on fire and you had to jump. To make amends for my wicked dreams in the
night, I saw myself rescuing Miss Richards—I should say my stepmother—as
flames teased her to the edge.</p>
<p>My father came out of his room and saw me standing there. “What are
you pulling such faces for?” he asked, and he imitated my
expressions.</p>
<p>“I was thinking,” I said, “of Miss Compton at our school.”</p>
<p>He had not foreseen the change in Miss Richards—how she would sit in
the house in her best clothes, like a visitor, expectant, forgetful,
stunned by leisure, watchful, wronged and jealous to the point of
tears.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Perhaps if the builders had come, as they had promised, on the
Monday, my stepmother’s story would have been different.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry we are in such a mess,” she said to me that morning at
breakfast. She had said it many times, as if she thought I regarded the
ladder as her failure.</p>
<p>“It’s fun,” I said. “It’s like being on a ship.”</p>
<p>“You keep on saying that,” my stepmother said, looking at me in a
very worried way, as if trying to work out the hidden meaning of my
remark. “You’ve never been on a ship.”</p>
<p>“To France,” I said. “When I was a child.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes,” said my stepmother.</p>
<p>“I hate mess,” said my stepmother to both of us, getting up. In a
prosaic person emotion looks grotesque, like clothes suddenly become too
large.</p>
<p>“Do leave us alone,” my father said.</p>
<p>There was a small scene after this. My father did not mean by “us”
himself and me, as she chose to think; he was simply speaking of himself
and he had spoken very mildly. My stepmother marched out of the room.
Presently, we heard her upstairs. She must have been very upset to have
faced going up the ladder.</p>
<p>“Come on,” said my father. “I suppose there’s nothing for it. I’ll
get the car out. We will go to the builders’.”</p>
<p>He called up to her that we were going and asked if she’d like to go
with us.</p>
<p>Oh, it was a terrible holiday. When I grew up and was myself married,
my father said, “It was a very difficult summer. You didn’t realize. You
were only a schoolgirl. It was a mistake.” And then he corrected
himself. I mean that. My father was always making himself more correct;
it was his chief vanity that he understood his own behavior.</p>
<p>“I happened,” he said—this was the correction—“to make a very foolish
mistake.” Whenever he used the phrase “I happened,” my father’s face
seemed to dry up and become distant; he was congratulating himself. Not
on the mistake, of course, but on being the first to put his finger on
it. “I happen to know,” “I happen to have seen”—it was this incidental
rightness, the footnote of inside knowledge on innumerable minor issues,
and his fatal wrongness, in a large, obstinate, principled way, about
anything important, that, I think, made my beautiful and dishonest
mother leave him. She was a tall woman, taller than he, with the eyes of
a cat, shrugging her shoulders, curving her long, graceful back to be
stroked, and with a wide, champagne laugh.</p>
<p>My father had a clipped-back, monkeyish appearance and that faint
grin of the bounder one sees in the harder-looking monkeys that are
without melancholy or sensibility; this had attracted my mother, but
very soon his youthful bounce gave place to a kind of meddling honesty
and she found him dull. And, of course, ruthless. The promptness of his
second marriage, perhaps, was to teach her a lesson. I imagine him
putting his divorce papers away one evening at his office and realizing,
when Miss Richards came in to ask if “there is anything more tonight,”
that here was a woman who was reliable, trained, and, like himself,
“happened” to have a lot of inside knowledge.</p>
<p>To get out of the house with my father, to be alone with him! My
heart came alive. It seemed to me that this house was not my home any
more. If only we could go away, he and I; the country outside seemed to
me far more like home than this grotesque divorced house. I stood
longing for her not to answer, dreading that she would come down.</p>
<p>My father was not a man to beg her to change her mind. He went out to
the garage. My fear of her coming made me stay for a moment. And then (I
do not know how the thought came into my head) I went to the ladder and
I lifted it away. It was easy to move a short distance, but it began to
swing when I tried to lay it down, and I was afraid it would crash. I
could not put it on the floor, so I turned it over and over against the
other wall, out of reach. Breathlessly, I left the house.</p>
<p>“You’ve got white on your tunic,” said my father as we drove off.
“What have you been doing?”</p>
<p>“I rubbed against something,” I said.</p>
<p>“Oh, how I love motoring.” I laughed beside my father.</p>
<p>“Oh, look at those lovely little rabbits,” I said.</p>
<p>“Their little white tails.” I laughed.</p>
<p>We passed some hurdles in a field.</p>
<p>“Jumps.” I laughed. “I wish I had a pony.”</p>
<p>“What would you do?” asked my father.</p>
<p>“Jump,” I said to my father.</p>
<p>And then my terrible dreams came back to me. I was frightened. I
tried to think of something else, but I could not. I could only see my
stepmother on the edge of the landing. I could only hear her giving a
scream and going over headfirst. We got into the town and I felt sick.
We arrived at the builders’ and my father stopped there. Only a girl was
in the office, and I heard my father say in his coldest voice, “I happen
to have an appointment.”</p>
<p>My father came out and we drove off. He was cross.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” I said when I saw we were not going home.</p>
<p>“To Longwood,” he said. “They’re working over there.”</p>
<p>I thought I would faint. “I—I—” I began.</p>
<p>“What?” my father said.</p>
<p>I could not speak. I began to get red and hot. And then I remembered.
I could pray.</p>
<p>It is seven miles to Longwood. My father was a man who enjoyed
talking to builders; he planned and replanned with them, built imaginary
houses, talked about people. Builders have a large acquaintance with the
way people live; my father liked inside knowledge, as I have said. Well,
I thought, she is over. She is dead by now. I saw visits to the
hospital. I saw my trial.</p>
<p>“She is like you,” said the builder, nodding to me. All my life I
shall remember his mustache.</p>
<p>“She is like my wife,” said my father. “My first wife. I happen to
have married twice.” He liked puzzling and embarrassing people. “Do you
happen to know a tea place near here?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” I said. “I don’t feel hungry.”</p>
<p>But we had tea at Gilling. The river is across the road from the
teashop and we stood afterward on the bridge. I surprised my father by
climbing the parapet.</p>
<p>“If you jumped,” I said to my father, “would you hurt?”</p>
<p>“You’d break your legs,” said my father.</p>
<p>Her “nicest thing”!</p>
<p>I shall not describe our drive back to the house, but my father did
say, “Janey will be worried. We’ve been nearly three hours. I’ll put the
car in afterward.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>When we got back, my father jumped out and went down the path. I got
out slowly. I could hardly walk down the path. It is a long path leading
across a small lawn, then between two lime trees; there are a few steps
down into where the roses are, and across another piece of grass you are
at the door. I stopped to listen to the bees in the limes, but I could
not wait any longer. I went into the house.</p>
<p>There was my stepmother standing on the landing above the hall. Her
face was dark red, her eyes were long and violent, her dress was dusty,
and her hands were black with dust. She had just finished screaming
something at my father, and her mouth had stayed open after her scream.
I thought I could smell her anger and her fear the moment I came into
the house, but it was really the smell of a burned-out saucepan coming
from the kitchen.</p>
<p>“You moved the ladder! Six hours I’ve been up here. The telephone has
been ringing, something has burned on the stove. I might have burned to
death. Get me down, get me down! I might have killed myself. Get me
down!” She came to the gap where the ladder ought to have been.</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly, Janey,” said my father. “I didn’t move the ladder.
Don’t be such a fool. You’re still alive.”</p>
<p>“Get me down!” Janey cried out. “You liar, you liar, you liar! You
did move it!”</p>
<p>My father lifted the ladder, and as he did so, he said, “The builder
must have been.”</p>
<p>“No one has been!” screamed my stepmother. “I’ve been alone! Up
here!”</p>
<p>“Daddy isn’t a liar,” I said, taking my father’s arm.</p>
<p>“Come down,” said my father when he had got the ladder in place. “I’m
holding it.”</p>
<p>And he went up a step or two toward her.</p>
<p>“No!” shrieked Janey.</p>
<p>“Now, come on. Calm yourself,” said my father.</p>
<p>“No, no, I tell you!” said Janey.</p>
<p>“All right, you must stay,” said my father, and stepped down.</p>
<p>That brought her, of course.</p>
<p>“I moved the ladder,” I said when she had come down.</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Janey, swinging her arm to hit me, but she fainted
instead.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>That night, my father came to my room when I was in bed. I had moved
my mother’s photograph to the bedside table. He was not angry. He was
tired out.</p>
<p>“Why did you do it?” he asked.</p>
<p>I did not answer.</p>
<p>“Did you know she was upstairs?” he asked.</p>
<p>I did not reply.</p>
<p>“Stop playing with the sheet,” he said. “Look at me. Did you know she
was upstairs?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“You little cat!” he said.</p>
<p>I smiled.</p>
<p>“It was very wrong,” he said.</p>
<p>I smiled. Presently he smiled. I laughed.</p>
<p>“It is nothing to laugh at,” he said. And suddenly he could not stop
himself; he laughed. The door opened and my stepmother looked in while
we were both shaking with laughter. My father laughed as if he were
laughing for the first time in many years; his bounderish look, sly and
bumptious and so delicious, came back to him. The door closed.</p>
<p>He stopped laughing.</p>
<p>“She might have been killed,” he said, severe again. And then he
remembered what I had asked him on the bridge at Gilling.</p>
<p>I lowered my head.</p>
<p>“You wanted—” he said.</p>
<p>“No, no, no!” I cried, and tears came to my eyes. He put his arm
around me.</p>
<p>My mother was a cat, they said, a wicked woman, leaving us like that.
I longed for my mother.</p>
<p>Three days later, I went to camp. I apologized to my stepmother and
she forgave me. I never saw her again.</p>
