<h4 id="voices-lost-in-snow">Voices Lost in Snow</h4>
<p>By Mavis Gallant (1976)</p>
<p>Halfway between our two great wars, parents whose own early years had
been shaped with Edwardian firmness were apt to lend a tone of finality
to quite simple remarks: “Because I say so” was the answer to “Why?,”
and a child’s response to “What did I just tell you?” could seldom be
anything but “Not to”—not to say, do, touch, remove, go out, argue,
reject, eat, pick up, open, shout, appear to sulk, appear to be cross.
Dark riddles filled the corners of life because no enlightenment was
thought required. Asking questions was “being tiresome,” while
persistent curiosity got one nowhere, at least nowhere of interest. How
much has changed? Observe the drift of words descending from adult to
child—the fall of personal questions, observations, unnecessary
instructions. Before long the listener seems blanketed. He must hear the
voice as authority muffled, a hum through snow. The tone has changed—it
may be coaxing, even plaintive—but the words have barely altered. They
still claim the ancient right-of-way through a young life.</p>
<p>“Well, old cock,” said my father’s friend Archie McEwen, meeting him
one Saturday in Montreal. “How’s Charlotte taking life in the country?”
Apparently no one had expected my mother to accept the country in
winter.</p>
<p>“Well, old cock,” I repeated to a country neighbor, Mr. Bainwood.
“How’s life?” What do you suppose it meant to me, other than a kind of
weathervane? Mr. Bainwood thought it over, then came round to our house
and complained to my mother.</p>
<p>“It isn’t blasphemy,” she said, not letting him have much
satisfaction from the complaint. Still, I had to apologize. “I’m sorry”
was a ritual habit with even less meaning than “old cock.” “Never say
that again,” my mother said after he had gone.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because I’ve just told you not to.”</p>
<p>“What does it mean?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>It must have been after yet another “nothing” that one summer’s day I
ran screaming around a garden, tore the heads off tulips, and—no, let
another voice finish it; the only authentic voices I have belong to the
dead: “…then she ate them.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>It was my father’s custom if he took me with him to visit a friend on
Saturdays not to say where we were going. He was more taciturn than any
man I have known since, but that wasn’t all of it; being young, I was
the last person to whom anyone owed an explanation. These Saturdays have
turned into one whitish afternoon, a windless snowfall, a steep street.
Two persons descend the street, stepping carefully. The child, reminded
every day to keep her hands still, gesticulates wildly—there is the
flash of a red mitten. I will never overtake this pair. Their voices are
lost in snow.</p>
<p>We were living in what used to be called the country and is now a
suburb of Montreal. On Saturdays my father and I came in together by
train. I went to the doctor, the dentist, to my German lesson. After
that I had to get back to Windsor Station by myself and on time. My
father gave me a boy’s watch so that the dial would be good and large. I
remember the No. 83 streetcar trundling downhill and myself, wondering
if the watch was slow, asking strangers to tell me the hour.
Inevitably—how could it have been otherwise?—after his death, which
would not be long in coming, I would dream that someone important had
taken a train without me. My route to the meeting place—deviated,
betrayed by stopped clocks—was always downhill. As soon as I was old
enough to understand from my reading of myths and legends that this
journey was a pursuit of darkness, its terminal point a sunless
underworld, the dream vanished.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would be taken along to lunch with one or another of my
father’s friends. He would meet the friend at Pauzé’s for oysters or at
Drury’s or the Windsor Grill. The friend would more often than not be
Scottish- or English-sounding, and they would talk as if I were
invisible, as Archie McEwen had done, and eat what I thought of as
English food—grilled kidneys, sweetbreads—which I was too finicky to
touch. Both my parents had been made wretched as children by having food
forced on them and so that particular torture was never inflicted on me.
However, the manner in which I ate was subject to precise attention. My
father disapproved of the North American custom that he called
“spearing” (knife laid on the plate, fork in the right hand). My
mother’s eye was out for a straight back, invisible chewing, small
mouthfuls, immobile silence during the interminable adult loafing over
dessert. My mother did not care for food. If we were alone together, she
would sit smoking and reading, sipping black coffee, her elbows used as
props—a posture that would have called for instant banishment had I so
much as tried it. Being constantly observed and corrected was like
having a fly buzzing around one’s plate. At Pauzé’s, the only child,
perhaps the only female, I sat up to an oak counter and ate oysters
quite neatly, not knowing exactly what they were and certainly not that
they were alive. They were served as in “The Walrus and the Carpenter,”
with bread and butter, pepper and vinegar. Dessert was a chocolate
biscuit—plates of them stood at intervals along the counter. When my
father and I ate alone, I was not required to say much, nor could I
expect a great deal in the way of response. After I had been addressing
him for minutes, sometimes he would suddenly come to life and I would
know he had been elsewhere. “Of course I’ve been listening,” he would
protest, and he would repeat by way of proof the last few words of
whatever it was I’d been saying. He was seldom present. I don’t know
where my father spent his waking life: just elsewhere.</p>
<p>What was he doing alone with a child? Where was his wife? In the
country, reading. She read one book after another without looking up,
without scraping away the frost on the windows. “The Russians, you know,
the Russians,” she said to her mother and me, glancing around in the
drugged way adolescent readers have. “They put salt on the windowsills
in winter.” Yes, so they did, in the nineteenth century, in the boyhood
of Turgenev, of Tolstoy. The salt absorbed the moisture between two sets
of windows sealed shut for half the year. She must have been in a
Russian country house at that moment, surrounded by a large Russian
family, living out vast Russian complications. The flat white fields
beyond her imaginary windows were like the flat white fields she would
have observed if only she had looked out. She was myopic; the pupil when
she had been reading seemed to be the whole of the eye. What age was she
then? Twenty-seven, twenty-eight. Her husband had removed her to the
country; now that they were there he seldom spoke. How young she seems
to me now—half twenty-eight in perception and feeling, but with a
husband, a child, a house, a life, an illiterate maid from the village
whose life she confidently interfered with and mismanaged, a small zoo
of animals she alternately cherished and forgot; and she was the
daughter of such a sensible, truthful, pessimistic woman—pessimistic in
the way women become when they settle for what actually exists.</p>
<p>Our rooms were not Russian—they were aired every day and the salt
became a great nuisance, blowing in on the floor.</p>
<p>“There, Charlotte, what did I tell you?” my grandmother said. This
grandmother did not care for dreams or for children. If I sensed the
first, I had no hint of the latter. Out of decency she kept it quiet, at
least in a child’s presence. She had the reputation, shared with a
long-vanished nurse named Olivia, of being able to “do anything” with
me, which merely meant an ability to provoke from a child behavior
convenient for adults. It was she who taught me to eat in the
Continental way, with both hands in sight at all times upon the table,
and who made me sit at meals with books under my arms so I would learn
not to stick out my elbows. I remember having accepted this nonsense
from her without a trace of resentment. Like Olivia, she could make the
most pointless sort of training seem a natural way of life. (I think
that as discipline goes this must be the most dangerous form of all.)
She was one of three godparents I had—the important one. It is
impossible for me to enter the mind of this agnostic who taught me
prayers, who had already shed every remnant of belief when she committed
me at the font. I know that she married late and reluctantly; she would
have preferred a life of solitude and independence, next to impossible
for a woman in her time. She had the positive voice of the born teacher,
sharp manners, quick blue eyes, and the square, massive figure common to
both lines of her ancestry—the West of France, the North of Germany.
When she said “There, Charlotte, what did I tell you?” without obtaining
an answer, it summed up mother and daughter both.</p>
<p>My father’s friend Malcolm Whitmore was the second godparent. He
quarreled with my mother when she said something flippant about
Mussolini, disappeared, died in Europe some years later, though perhaps
not fighting for Franco, as my mother had it. She often rewrote other
people’s lives, providing them with suitable and harmonious endings. In
her version of events you were supposed to die as you’d lived. He would
write sometimes, asking me, “Have you been confirmed yet?” He had never
really held a place and could not by dying leave a gap. The third
godparent was a young woman named Georgie Henderson. She was my mother’s
choice, for a long time her confidante, partisan, and close sympathizer.
Something happened, and they stopped seeing each other. Georgie was not
her real name—it was Edna May. One of the reasons she had fallen out
with my mother was that I had not been called Edna May too. Apparently,
this had been promised.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Without saying where we were going, my father took me along to visit
Georgie one Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>“You didn’t say you were bringing Linnet” was how she greeted him. We
stood in the passage of a long, hot, high-ceilinged apartment, treading
snow water into the rug.</p>
<p>He said, “Well, she is your godchild, and she has been ill.”</p>
<p>My godmother shut the front door and leaned her back against it. It
is in this surprisingly dramatic pose that I recall her. It would be
unfair to repeat what I think I saw then, for she and I were to meet
again once, only once, many years after this, and I might substitute a
lined face for a smooth one and tough, large-knuckled hands for fingers
that may have been delicate. One has to allow elbowroom in the account
of a rival: “She must have had something” is how it generally goes, long
after the initial “What can he see in her? He must be deaf and blind.”
Georgie, explained by my mother as being the natural daughter of Sarah
Bernhardt and a stork, is only a shadow, a tracing, with long arms and
legs and one of those slightly puggy faces with pulled-up eyes.</p>
<p>Her voice remains—the husky Virginia-tobacco whisper I associate with
so many women of that generation, my parents’ friends; it must have come
of age in English Montreal around 1920, when girls began to cut their
hair and to smoke. In middle life the voice would slide from low to
harsh, and develop a chronic cough. For the moment it was fascinating to
me—opposite in pitch and speed from my mother’s, which was slightly too
high and apt to break off, like that of a singer unable to sustain a
long note.</p>
<p>It was true that I had been ill, but I don’t think my godmother made
much of it that afternoon, other than saying, “It’s all very well to
talk about that now, but I was certainly never told much, and as for
that doctor, you ought to just hear what Ward thinks.” Out of this
whispered jumble my mother stood accused—of many transgressions,
certainly, but chiefly of having discarded Dr. Ward Mackey, everyone’s
doctor and a family friend. At the time of my birth my mother had all at
once decided she liked Ward Mackey better than anyone else and had asked
him to choose a name for me. He could not think of one, or, rather,
thought of too many, and finally consulted his own mother. She had
always longed for a daughter, so that she could call her after the
heroine of a novel by, I believe, Marie Corelli. The legend so often
repeated to me goes on to tell that when I was seven weeks old my father
suddenly asked, “What did you say her name was?”</p>
<p>“Votre fille a frôlé la phtisie,” the new doctor had said, the one
who had now replaced Dr. Mackey. The new doctor was known to me as Uncle
Raoul, though we were not related. This manner of declaring my brush
with consumption was worlds away from Ward Mackey’s “subject to bilious
attacks.” Mackey’s objections to Uncle Raoul were neither envious nor
personal, for Mackey was the sort of bachelor who could console himself
with golf. The Protestant in him truly believed those other doctors to
be poorly trained and superstitious, capable of recommending the pulling
of teeth to cure tonsillitis, and of letting their patients cough to
death or perish from septicemia just through Catholic fatalism.</p>
<p>What parent could fail to gasp and marvel at Uncle Raoul’s
announcement? Any but either of mine. My mother could invent and produce
better dramas any day; as for my father, his French wasn’t all that good
and he had to have it explained. Once he understood that I had grazed
the edge of tuberculosis, he made his decision to remove us all to the
country, which he had been wanting a reason to do for some time. He was,
I think, attempting to isolate his wife, but by taking her out of the
city he exposed her to a danger that, being English, he had never
dreamed of: this was the heart-stopping cry of the steam train at night,
sweeping across a frozen river, clattering on the ties of a wooden
bridge. From our separate rooms my mother and I heard the unrivaled
summons, the long, urgent, uniquely North American beckoning. She would
follow and so would I, but separately, years and desires and
destinations apart. I think that women once pledged in such a manner are
more steadfast than men.</p>
<p>“Frôler” was the charmed word in that winter’s story; it was a hand
brushing the edge of folded silk, a leaf escaping a spiderweb. Being
caught in the web would have meant staying in bed day and night in a
place even worse than a convent school. Charlotte and Angus, whose lives
had once seemed so enchanted, so fortunate and free that I could not
imagine lesser persons so much as eating the same kind of toast for
breakfast, had to share their lives with me, whether they wanted to or
not—thanks to Uncle Raoul, who always supposed me to be their principal
delight. I had been standing on one foot for months now, midway between
frôler and falling into, propped up by a psychosomatic guardian angel.
Of course I could not stand that way forever; inevitably my health
improved and before long I was declared out of danger and then
restored—to the relief and pleasure of all except the patient.</p>
<p>“I’d like to see more of you than eyes and nose,” said my godmother.
“Take off your things.” I offer this as an example of unnecessary
instruction. Would anyone over the age of three prepare to spend the
afternoon in a stifling room wrapped like a mummy in outdoor clothes?
“She’s smaller than she looks,” Georgie remarked, as I began to emerge.
This authentic godmother observation drives me to my only refuge, the
insistence that she must have had something—he could not have been
completely deaf and blind. Divested of hat, scarf, coat, overshoes, and
leggings, grasping the handkerchief pressed in my hand so I would not
interrupt later by asking for one, responding to my father’s muttered
“Fix your hair,” struck by the command because it was he who had told me
not to use “fix” in that sense, I was finally able to sit down next to
him on a white sofa. My godmother occupied its twin. A low table stood
between, bearing a decanter and glasses and a pile of magazines and, of
course, Georgie’s ashtrays; I think she smoked even more than my mother
did.</p>
<p>On one of these sofas, during an earlier visit with my mother and
father, the backs of my dangling feet had left a smudge of shoe polish.
It may have been the last occasion when my mother and Georgie were ever
together. Directed to stop humming and kicking, and perhaps bored with
the conversation in which I was not expected to join, I had soon started
up again.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter,” my godmother said, though you could tell she
minded.</p>
<p>“Sit up,” my father said to me.</p>
<p>“I am sitting up. What do you think I’m doing?” This was not
answering but answering back; it is not an expression I ever heard from
my father, but I am certain it stood like a stalled truck in Georgie’s
mind. She wore the look people put on when they are thinking, Now what
are you spineless parents going to do about that?</p>
<p>“Oh, for God’s sake, she’s only a child,” said my mother, as though
that had ever been an excuse for anything.</p>
<p>Soon after the sofa-kicking incident she and Georgie moved into the
hibernation known as “not speaking.” This, the lingering condition of
half my mother’s friendships, usually followed her having said the very
thing no one wanted to hear, such as “Who wants to be called Edna May,
anyway?”</p>
<p>Once more in the hot pale room where there was nothing to do and
nothing for children, I offended my godmother again, by pretending I had
never seen her before. The spot I had kicked was pointed out to me,
though, owing to new slipcovers, real evidence was missing. My father
was proud of my quite surprising memory, of its long backward reach and
the minutiae of detail I could describe. My failure now to shine in a
domain where I was naturally gifted, that did not require lessons or
create litter and noise, must have annoyed him. I also see that my
guileless-seeming needling of my godmother was a close adaptation of how
my mother could be, and I attribute it to a child’s instinctive loyalty
to the absent one. Giving me up, my godmother placed a silver dish of
mint wafers where I could reach them—white, pink, and green,
overlapping—and suggested I look at a magazine. Whatever the magazine
was, I had probably seen it, for my mother subscribed to everything
then. I may have turned the pages anyway, in case at home something had
been censored for children. I felt and am certain I have not invented
Georgie’s disappointment at not seeing Angus alone. She disliked
Charlotte now, and so I supposed he came to call by himself, having no
quarrel of his own; he was still close to the slighted Ward Mackey.</p>
<p>My father and Georgie talked for a while—she using people’s initials
instead of their names, which my mother would not have done—and they
drank what must have been sherry, if I think of the shape of the
decanter. Then we left and went down to the street in a wood-paneled
elevator that had sconce lights, as in a room. The end of the afternoon
had a particular shade of color then, which is not tinted by distance or
enhancement but has to do with how streets were lighted. Lamps were
still gas, and their soft gradual blooming at dusk made the sky turn a
peacock blue that slowly deepened to marine, then indigo. This uneven
light falling in blurred pools gave the snow it touched a quality of
phosphorescence, beyond which were night shadows in which no one lurked.
There were few cars, little sound. A fresh snowfall would lie in the
streets in a way that seemed natural. Sidewalks were dangerous, casually
sanded; even on busy streets you found traces of the icy slides
children’s feet had made. The reddish brown of the stone houses, the
curve and slope of the streets, the constantly changing sky were
satisfactory in a way that I now realize must have been aesthetically
comfortable. This is what I saw when I read “city” in a book; I had no
means of knowing that “city” one day would also mean drab, filthy, flat,
or that city blocks could turn into dull squares without mystery.</p>
<p>We crossed Sherbrooke Street, starting down to catch our train. My
father walked everywhere in all weathers. Already mined, colonized by an
enemy prepared to destroy what it fed on, fighting it with every wrong
weapon, squandering strength he should have been storing, stifling pain
in silence rather than speaking up while there might have been time, he
gave an impression of sternness that was a shield against suffering. One
day we heard a mob roaring four syllables over and over, and we turned
and went down a different street. That sound was starkly terrifying,
something a child might liken to the baying of wolves.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Howie Morenz.”</p>
<p>“Who is it? Are they chasing him?”</p>
<p>“No, they like him,” he said of the hockey player admired to the
point of dementia. He seemed to stretch, as if trying to keep every bone
in his body from touching a nerve; a look of helplessness such as I had
never seen on a grown person gripped his face and he said this strange
thing: “Crowds eat me. Noise eats me.” The kind of physical pain that
makes one seem rat’s prey is summed up in my memory of this.</p>
<p>When we came abreast of the Ritz-Carlton after leaving Georgie’s
apartment, my father paused. The lights within at that time of day were
golden and warm. If I barely knew what “hotel” meant, never having
stayed in one, I connected the lights with other snowy afternoons, with
stupefying adult conversation (Oh, those shut-in velvet-draped unaired
low-voice problems!) compensated for by creamy bitter hot chocolate
poured out of a pink-and-white china pot.</p>
<p>“You missed your gootay,” he suddenly remembered. Established by my
grandmother, “goûter” was the family word for tea. He often transformed
French words, like putty, into shapes he could grasp. No, Georgie had
not provided a goûter, other than the mint wafers, but it was not her
fault—I had not been announced. Perhaps if I had not been so
disagreeable with her, he might have proposed hot chocolate now, though
I knew better than to ask. He merely pulled my scarf up over my nose and
mouth, as if recalling something Uncle Raoul had advised. Breathing
inside knitted wool was delicious—warm, moist, pungent when one had been
sucking on mint candies, as now. He said, “You didn’t enjoy your visit
much.”</p>
<p>“Not very,” through red wool.</p>
<p>“No matter,” he said. “You needn’t see Georgie again unless you want
to,” and we walked on. He must have been smarting, for he liked me to be
admired. When I was not being admired I was supposed to keep quiet. “You
needn’t see Georgie again” was also a private decision about himself. He
was barely thirty-one and had a full winter to live after this
one—little more. Why? “Because I say so.” The answer seems to speak out
of the lights, the stones, the snow; out of the crucial second when
inner and outer forces join, and the environment becomes part of the
enemy too.</p>
<p>Ward Mackey used to mention me as “Angus’s precocious pain in the
neck,” which is better than nothing. Long after that afternoon, when I
was about twenty, Mackey said to me, “Georgie didn’t play her cards well
where he was concerned. There was a point where if she had just made one
smart move she could have had him. Not for long, of course, but none of
us knew that.”</p>
<p>What cards, I wonder. The cards have another meaning for me—they mean
a trip, a death, a letter, tomorrow, next year. I saw only one move that
Saturday: my father placed a card face up on the table and watched to
see what Georgie made of it. She shrugged, let it rest. There she sits,
looking puggy but capable, Angus waiting, the precocious pain in the
neck turning pages, hoping to find something in the National Geographic
harmful for children. I brush in memory against the spiderweb: what if
she had picked it up, remarking in her smoky voice, “Yes, I can use
that”? It was a low card, the kind that only a born gambler would risk
as part of a long-term strategy. She would never have weakened a hand
that way; she was not gambling but building. He took the card back and
dropped his hand, and their long intermittent game came to an end. The
card must have been the eight of clubs—“a female child.”</p>
