<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>The New Yorker—which was founded in 1925 by the journalist and editor
Harold Ross, who headed the magazine for its first twenty-six years, and
his wife, Jane Grant, a New York Times reporter—was first envisioned as
a humor magazine (a “fifteen-cent comic paper” was how Ross described
it). The fiction that appeared in the magazine in its first three years
was lighthearted, bantering, parodic, or satirical, in most cases
indistinguishable from the humor writing or “casuals.” In 1928,
Katharine Angell (later Katharine White), who had been hired as a
manuscript reader in 1925, wrote to a number of short-story writers
soliciting more “serious” fiction, and by 1939 she was putting together
the magazine’s first fiction anthology—a volume that, she wrote to Ross,
would be “a distinguished collection of short stories which, though we
didn’t set out to do it, we seem to have amassed during the years. It
would be mostly savage, serious, moving, or just well written fiction
with some that are funny in part.”</p>

<p>Reading through New Yorker fiction from the first century of the
magazine is like watching a time-lapse film in which what a story is, or
intends to be, changes slightly with each frame. The stories from the
first fifteen years of the magazine’s life are, for the most part, what
we’d now call sketches—each a pithy short scene, bound to one setting,
that ends with a punchline of sorts, not necessarily a funny one, but a
telling moment in which the protagonist (not always but most often male)
confronts a new reality. Or, as James Thurber complained to White in
1938, “We’ve had an awful lot of the sad drifting little men, muddling
gently through the most trivial and impalpable of situations, ending up
on a faint and, to me, usually evasive note of resignation to it all,
whatever it all is.” In the thirties, plot was frowned upon, as was
indirection, and a failure to divulge location, time period, and other
salient data in the first paragraph. (It would have been difficult to
accommodate very involved plots at a time when White was warning new
contributors, according to Ben Yagoda’s history of The New Yorker, About
Town, that stories generally ran “three thousand words or less.”) White
had a low tolerance for autobiographical fiction, as well. “For the
purposes of this anthology,” the foreword to Short Stories from “The New
Yorker,” 1925–1940 noted, “reminiscence was ruled out…. Parable,
prophecy, fable, fantasy, satire, burlesque, parody, nonsense tales…were
also omitted.”</p>
<p>In the forties, things got a bit snappier. As Zadie Smith writes in
the New Yorker anthology The 40s: The Story of a Decade, “Dialogue was
the thing…. Many of the writers…did some work in Hollywood.” Also a
thing, she adds, was “a robust sense of morality.” Lionel Trilling
writing, in The Nation in 1942, agrees: “The New Yorker publishes…a kind
of short story the main characteristic of which is its great moral
intensity. Every week, at the barber’s or the dentist’s or on the
commuting train, a representative part of the middle class learns about
the horrors of snobbery, ignorance, and insensitivity and about the
sufferings of children, servants, the superannuated, and the
subordinate.” These stories have a neatness to them, sharp edges, right
angles, clearly defined conceits; only occasionally do they spill out a
little and hint at something more. It was a neatness that some of the
writers themselves rebelled against. Irwin Shaw, writing to the fiction
editor Gus Lobrano in 1943, complained about “the patronizing sniffing
of critics when they call my stories ‘New Yorker stories,’ meaning
thereby something pallid and cold that is inexplicably used to pad out
the space between cartoons and the Talk of the Town…. There is no reason
for losing urbanity, but there is place for emotion, place for personal
writing, too.” The New York Times, reviewing a story collection by John
Cheever in the same year, noted, “There are thirty sketches in this
volume; all of them are worth at least five minutes of your time, even
though the majority are exercises in marital frustration, hag-ridden
dipsomania, poverty, or plain and fancy jitters. Most of them appeared
between the covers of The New Yorker. Perhaps this accounts for their
peculiar epicene detachment, and facile despair.”</p>
<p>The fifties offer neatness of another kind. A retreat, presumably,
from the trauma of war into the safety of domesticity, the clarity of
family relationships—though that clarity is often blurred by straying
husbands or the consequences of divorce. Along with that, a return
perhaps to that note of resignation. In these years, according to
Jonathan Franzen, writing in the New Yorker anthology The 50s: The Story
of a Decade, “What made a story New Yorker was its carefully wrought,
many-comma’d prose; its long passages of physical description, the
precision and the sobriety of which created a kind of negative emotional
space, a suggestion of feeling without the naming of it;…and, above all,
its signature style of ending, which was either elegantly oblique or
frustratingly coy, depending on your taste.” By the fifties, The New
Yorker’s resistance to autobiographical fiction had returned. “Narrative
writers of the present generation have so often drawn upon the material
of their own past that there is no longer a hard and fast line between
fiction and autobiography, but we have included here autobiographical
stories only where the facts are dealt with freely and imaginatively,”
the editors of Short Stories from “The New Yorker,” 1950–1960 wrote. In
other words, elements of these stories had to be provably untrue. Of
course, in the first sixty-seven years of The New Yorker’s century,
there was no rubric in the magazine for fiction—no banner above a
story’s title (or on the table of contents) classifying it as a short
story, as opposed to memoir, reporting, or criticism. One simply had to
figure it out as one read.</p>
<p>By the time we get to the sixties and seventies, messiness prevails.
Some stories meander and sprawl, one paragraph doesn’t always lead to
the next, meaning is in the moment, not in the conclusion. Other pieces,
whose authors were perhaps reeling from wars that felt more
ambiguous—wars in which there was far more question as to whether one
side was right and the other wrong—dive deep into absurdity, the
fantastical. In 1963, the thirty-one-year-old Donald Barthelme first
appeared in the magazine, with number one of a hundred and twenty
explosively strange yet unforgettable nonnarratives. It was a time of
change, a time of toying with the narrative line, a time of meaning and
deliberate avoidance of meaning, a time of colloquialism,
ridiculousness, and desperation, all in crazy coexistence with the more
traditional strands of fiction. Read Barthelme’s iconoclastic prose
poems alongside the sly shtetl fables of Isaac Bashevis Singer or Jorge
Luis Borges’s multilayered allegorical teases, both of which were first
published in The New Yorker in 1967, or Ann Beattie’s playful, sad
comedies of misconnection, which began to appear in the magazine in
1974, and you have a sense of the literary disjunctions, as well as the
writers’ common goal: to pull us all into the political, cultural,
emotional maelstrom of the era.</p>
<p>This period sees also an influx of voices from elsewhere. Although
Irish and British writers had found regular representation in The New
Yorker’s fiction section in earlier years, along with the occasional
Canadian, with the exception of Vladimir Nabokov, who began publishing
fiction in the magazine in 1945, and Nadine Gordimer, who published her
first story in the magazine in 1951, writers of other nationalities were
rare until the late fifties. In the sixties, Singer and Borges, along
with the Austrian-born Lore Segal, the Australian Shirley Hazzard, and
others begin to make frequent contributions. The late seventies bring
fiction by Jamaica Kincaid, from Antigua, Stanisław Lem, from Poland,
Milan Kundera, from Czechoslovakia, and more.</p>
<p>If there is a shift in the eighties and nineties, it represents
perhaps an urge to capture something more sociological in the changing
world, and also a new exuberance—a new kind of thrill at breaking the
rules of voice in storytelling, if they ever existed. Still, under the
editorship of William Shawn, from 1952 to 1987, the magazine eschewed
vulgarity, profanity, and sexual imagery. In the mid-eighties, when
Alice Munro wanted to publish a story in which a woman’s pubic hair was
described as “the rat between Dina’s legs,” she was prevailed upon to
rewrite the phrase as the “dark, silky pelt of some unlucky rodent.” The
prohibition was slowly lifted: the word “fuck” first appeared in the
magazine in 1985, and not just “rat” as a synonym for female genitalia
but “pussy” in 1993. Throughout the decade and into the nineties, there
is a loosening of language, an openness to oddness in voice or in
pacing, an influx of styles as varied as those of George Saunders,
Haruki Murakami, Lorrie Moore, Junot Díaz, David Foster Wallace, Zadie
Smith, and even Samuel Beckett. By this point, stories have evolved from
the sketches of the thirties to full-blown narratives, almost
mini-novels. Lifetimes—or multiple generations—can be encapsulated,
single moments viewed through many eyes, long stretches of time leaped.
Change occurs frequently in the space of a narrative; the reader ends
somewhere quite far from where she began.</p>
<p>These are generalizations, of course, and there were many stories in
the magazine—and some in this anthology—that do not fit into these
delineations. About the last two decades it’s almost impossible for me
to opine. I cannot see the forest for the trees; the root systems are
still buried, and will, I presume, be dug up by whoever comes next.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>To say that it was a daunting task to choose seventy-eight stories
from a hundred years of The New Yorker, a century in which more than
thirteen thousand pieces of fiction were published in the magazine, is
beyond an understatement. The question wasn’t just which those
seventy-eight stories should be, but what, if anything, they should
represent: Did they need to be the “best” stories published in the
magazine (as if there were a way of quantifying quality)? Did they need
to feature work by the writers whose names had historically been most
associated with The New Yorker—the Johns (O’Hara, Updike, Cheever), say,
or the Irish (Edna O’Brien, William Trevor, and others)? Should they
include the stories that had become famous, been reprinted in
generations of textbooks and anthologies, or turned into celebrated
movies—Shirley Jackson’s “The Lottery,” say, or Annie Proulx’s
“Brokeback Mountain”? Should they be chosen to represent the work of
writers who had been important in the magazine’s history, or was the
goal to showcase stories, stories that had held up in memory, in the
culture, in the popular imagination, regardless of their byline? Should
I jettison stories that were beloved in their time but now felt a little
dusty, a little too of their time? Or stories that, although they had
literary merit, presented opinions and attitudes—toward people of color
or toward women, for instance—that were perhaps thought “acceptable”
when the stories were published but are definitely not so today? Should
I consider the choices of previous New Yorker anthologists? Should there
be surprises? Would there conceivably be room for surprises? How could I
possibly judge the long-term impact of stories published in recent years
that had not yet had time to settle solidly in our imaginations and in
their cultural context? What could I do about the glaring omissions,
since there would inevitably, for space reasons, be many?</p>
<p>There was no perfect answer to these questions, and I had to proceed
instinctively, taking the questions into account, but also simply
feeling around for the stories, the scenes, the lines, the fictional
worlds that kept returning to my thoughts. The only hard rule I set for
myself was not to include material that had come to us as part of a
novel or a longer work. (A few pieces here were written as freestanding
stories and later incorporated into novels.) The anthology of my dreams
would be at least twice as long.</p>
<p>The stories appear in chronological order. Some years go unplumbed;
other, banner years for fiction are represented by several stories. The
book cannot, of course, be read as a complete record of the short
story’s transformative journey from 1925 to 2025. But, if that journey
is a road, I hope that the stories included here can serve as signposts
along the way, with a detour here, a scenic overlook there. Happy
travels!</p>
