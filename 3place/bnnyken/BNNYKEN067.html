<h4 id="the-embassy-of-cambodia">The Embassy of Cambodia</h4>
<p>By Zadie Smith (2013)</p>
<p>0–1</p>
<p>Who would expect the Embassy of Cambodia? Nobody. Nobody could have
expected it, or be expecting it. It’s a surprise, to us all. The Embassy
of Cambodia!</p>
<p>Next door to the embassy is a health center. On the other side, a row
of private residences, most of them belonging to wealthy Arabs (or so
we, the people of Willesden, contend). They have Corinthian pillars on
either side of their front doors, and—it’s widely believed—swimming
pools out back. The embassy, by contrast, is not very grand. It is only
a four- or five-bedroom North London suburban villa, built at some point
in the thirties, surrounded by a red brick wall, about eight feet high.
And back and forth, cresting this wall horizontally, flies a
shuttlecock. They are playing badminton in the Embassy of Cambodia.
Pock, smash. Pock, smash.</p>
<p>The only real sign that the embassy is an embassy at all is the
little brass plaque on the door (which reads, “The Embassy of Cambodia”)
and the national flag of Cambodia (we assume that’s what it is—what else
could it be?) flying from the red tiled roof. Some say, “Oh, but it has
a high wall around it, and this is what signifies that it is not a
private residence, like the other houses on the street but, rather, an
embassy.” The people who say so are foolish. Many of the private houses
have high walls, quite as high as the Embassy of Cambodia’s—but they are
not embassies.</p>
<p>0–2</p>
<p>On the sixth of August, Fatou walked past the embassy for the first
time, on her way to a swimming pool. It is a large pool, although not
quite Olympic size. To swim a mile you must complete eighty-two lengths,
which, in its very tedium, often feels as much a mental exercise as a
physical one. The water is kept unusually warm, to please the majority
of people who patronize the health center, the kind who come not so much
to swim as to lounge poolside or rest their bodies in the sauna. Fatou
has swum here five or six times now, and she is often the youngest
person in the pool by several decades. Generally, the clientele are
white, or else South Asian or from the Middle East, but now and then
Fatou finds herself in the water with fellow-Africans. When she spots
these big men, paddling frantically like babies, struggling simply to
stay afloat, she prides herself on her own abilities, having taught
herself to swim, several years earlier, at the Carib Beach Resort, in
Accra. Not in the hotel pool—no employees were allowed in the pool. No,
she learned by struggling through the rough gray sea, on the other side
of the resort walls. Rising and sinking, rising and sinking, on the
dirty foam. No tourist ever stepped onto the beach (it was covered with
trash), much less into the cold and treacherous sea. Nor did any of the
other chambermaids. Only some reckless teen-age boys, late at night, and
Fatou, early in the morning. There is almost no way to compare swimming
at Carib Beach and swimming in the health center, warm as it is,
tranquil as a bath. And, as Fatou passes the Embassy of Cambodia, on her
way to the pool, over the high wall she sees a shuttlecock, passed back
and forth between two unseen players. The shuttlecock floats in a wide
arc softly rightward, and is smashed back, and this happens again and
again, the first player always somehow able to retrieve the smash and
transform it, once more, into a gentle, floating arc. High above, the
sun tries to force its way through a cloud ceiling, gray and filled with
water. Pock, smash. Pock, smash.</p>
<p>0–3</p>
<p>When the Embassy of Cambodia first appeared in our midst, a few years
ago, some of us said, “Well, if we were poets perhaps we could have
written some sort of an ode about this surprising appearance of the
embassy.” (For embassies are usually to be found in the center of the
city. This was the first one we had seen in the suburbs.) But we are not
really a poetic people. We are from Willesden. Our minds tend toward the
prosaic. I doubt there is a man or woman among us, for example, who—upon
passing the Embassy of Cambodia for the first time—did not immediately
think: “genocide.”</p>
<p>0–4</p>
<p>Pock, smash. Pock, smash. This summer we watched the Olympics,
becoming well attuned to grunting, and to the many other human sounds
associated with effort and the triumph of the will. But the players in
the garden of the Embassy of Cambodia are silent. (We can’t say for sure
that it is a garden—we have a limited view over the wall. It may well be
a paved area, reserved for badminton.) The only sign that a game of
badminton is under way at all is the motion of the shuttlecock itself,
alternately being lobbed and smashed, lobbed and smashed, and always at
the hour that Fatou passes on her way to the health center to swim (just
after ten in the morning on Mondays). It should be explained that it is
Fatou’s employers—and not Fatou—who are the true members of this health
club; they have no idea that she uses their guest passes in this way.
(Mr. and Mrs. Derawal and their three children—aged seventeen, fifteen,
and ten—live on the same street as the embassy, but the road is almost a
mile long, with the embassy at one end and the Derawals at the other.)
Fatou’s deception is possible only because on Mondays Mr. Derawal drives
to Eltham to visit his mini-market there, and Mrs. Derawal works the
counter in the family’s second mini-mart, in Kensal Rise. In the slim
drawer of a faux-Louis XVI console, in the entrance hall of the
Derawals’ primary residence, one can find a stockpile of guest passes.
Nobody besides Fatou seems to remember that they are there.</p>
<p>Since August 6th (the first occasion on which she noticed the
badminton), Fatou has made a point of pausing by the bus stop opposite
the embassy for five or ten minutes before she goes in to swim, idle
minutes she can hardly afford (Mrs. Derawal returns to the house at
lunchtime) and yet seems unable to forgo. Such is the strangely
compelling aura of the embassy. Usually, Fatou gains nothing from this
waiting and observing, but on a few occasions she has seen people arrive
at the embassy and watched as they are buzzed through the gate. Young
white people carrying rucksacks. Often they are scruffy, and wearing
sandals, despite the cool weather. None of the visitors so far have been
visibly Cambodian. These young people are likely looking for visas. They
are buzzed in and then pass through the gate, although Fatou would
really have to stand on top of the bus stop to get a view of whoever it
is that lets them in. What she can say with certainty is that these
occasional arrivals have absolutely no effect on the badminton, which
continues in its steady pattern, first gentle, then fast, first soft and
high, then hard and low.</p>
<p>0–5</p>
<p>On the twentieth of August, long after the Olympians had returned to
their respective countries, Fatou noticed that a basketball hoop had
appeared in the far corner of the garden, its net of synthetic white
rope rising high enough to be seen over the wall. But no basketball was
ever played—at least not when Fatou was passing. The following week it
had been moved closer to Fatou’s side of the wall. (It must be a mobile
hoop, on casters.) Fatou waited a week, two weeks, but still no
basketball game replaced the badminton, which carried on as before.</p>
<p>0-6</p>
<p>When I say that we were surprised by the appearance of the Embassy of
Cambodia, I don’t mean to suggest that the embassy is in any way unique
in its peculiarity. In fact, this long, wide street is notable for a
number of curious buildings, in the context of which the Embassy of
Cambodia does not seem especially strange. There is a mansion called
Garyland, with something else in Arabic engraved below Garyland, and
both the English and the Arabic text are inlaid in pink-and-green marble
pillars that bookend a gigantic fence, far higher than the embassy’s,
better suited to a fortress. Dramatic golden gates open automatically to
let vehicles in and out. At any one time, Garyland has five to seven
cars parked in its driveway.</p>
<p>There is a house with a huge pink elephant on the doorstep,
apparently made of mosaic tiles.</p>
<p>There is a Catholic nunnery with a single red Ford Focus parked in
front. There is a Sikh institute. There is a faux-Tudor house with a
pool that Mickey Rooney rented for a season, while he was performing in
the West End fifteen summers ago. That house sits opposite a dingy
retirement home, where one sometimes sees distressed souls, barely
covered by their dressing gowns, standing on their tiny balconies,
staring into the tops of the chestnut trees.</p>
<p>So we are hardly strangers to curious buildings, here in Willesden
andandandand Brondesbury. And yet still we find the Embassy of Cambodia
a little surprising. It is not the right sort of surprise, somehow.</p>
<p>0–7</p>
<p>In a discarded Metro found on the floor of the Derawal kitchen, Fatou
read with interest a story about a Sudanese “slave” living in a rich
man’s house in London. It was not the first time that Fatou had wondered
if she herself was a slave, but this story, brief as it was, confirmed
in her own mind that she was not. After all, it was her father, and not
a kidnapper, who had taken her from Ivory Coast to Ghana, and when they
reached Accra they had both found employment in the same hotel. Two
years later, when she was eighteen, it was her father again who had
organized her difficult passage to Libya and then on to Italy—a not
insignificant financial sacrifice on his part. Also, Fatou could read
English—and speak a little Italian—and this girl in the paper could not
read or speak anything except the language of her tribe. And nobody beat
Fatou, although Mrs. Derawal had twice slapped her in the face, and the
two older children spoke to her with no respect at all and thanked her
for nothing. (Sometimes she heard her name used as a term of abuse
between them. “You’re as black as Fatou.” Or “You’re as stupid as
Fatou.”) On the other hand, just like the girl in the newspaper, she had
not seen her passport with her own eyes since she arrived at the
Derawals’, and she had been told from the start that her wages were to
be retained by the Derawals to pay for the food and water and heat she
would require during her stay, as well as to cover the rent for the room
she slept in. In the final analysis, however, Fatou was not confined to
the house. She had an Oyster Card, given to her by the Derawals, and was
trusted to do the food shopping and other outside tasks for which she
was given cash and told to return with change and receipts for
everything. If she did not go out in the evenings that was only because
she had no money with which to go out, and anyway knew very few people
in London. Whereas the girl in the paper was not allowed to leave her
employers’ premises, not ever—she was a prisoner.</p>
<p>On Sunday mornings, for example, Fatou regularly left the house to
meet her church friend Andrew Okonkwo at the 98 bus stop and go with him
to worship at the Sacred Heart of Jesus, just off the Kilburn High Road.
Afterward Andrew always took her to a Tunisian café, where they had
coffee and cake, which Andrew, who worked as a night guard in the City,
always paid for. And on Mondays Fatou swam. In very warm water, and
thankful for the semi-darkness in which the health club, for some
reason, kept its clientele, as if the place were a night club, or a
midnight Mass. The darkness helped disguise the fact that her swimming
costume was in fact a sturdy black bra and a pair of plain black cotton
knickers. No, on balance she did not think she was a slave.</p>
<p>0–8</p>
<p>The woman exiting the Embassy of Cambodia did not look especially
like a New Person or an Old Person—neither clearly of the city nor of
the country—and of course it is a long time since this division meant
anything in Cambodia. Nor did these terms mean anything to Fatou, who
was curious only to catch her first sighting of a possible Cambodian
anywhere near the Embassy of Cambodia. She was particularly interested
in the woman’s clothes, which were precise and utilitarian—a gray shirt
tucked tightly into a pair of tan slacks, a blue mackintosh, a droopy
rain hat—just as if she were a man, or no different from a man. Her
straight black hair was cut short. She had in her hands many bags from
Sainsbury’s, and this Fatou found a little mysterious: where was she
taking all that shopping? It also surprised her that the woman from the
Embassy of Cambodia should shop in the same Willesden branch of
Sainsbury’s where Fatou shopped for the Derawals. She had an idea that
Oriental people had their own, secret establishments. (She believed the
Jews did, too.) She both admired and slightly resented this
self-reliance, but had no doubt that it was the secret to holding great
power, as a people. For example, when the Chinese had come to Fatou’s
village to take over the mine, an abiding local mystery had been: what
did they eat and where did they eat it? They certainly did not buy food
in the market, or from the Lebanese traders along the main road. They
made their own arrangements. (Whether back home or here, the key to
surviving as a people, in Fatou’s opinion, was to make your own
arrangements.)</p>
<p>But, looking again at the bags the Cambodian woman carried, Fatou
wondered whether they weren’t in fact very old bags—hadn’t their design
changed? The more she looked at them the more convinced she became that
they contained not food but clothes or something else again, the outline
of each bag being a little too rounded and smooth. Maybe she was simply
taking out the rubbish. Fatou stood at the bus stop and watched until
the Cambodian woman reached the corner, crossed, and turned left toward
the high road. Meanwhile, back at the embassy the badminton continued to
be played, though with a little more effort now because of a wayward
wind. At one point it seemed to Fatou that the next lob would blow
southward, sending the shuttlecock over the wall to land lightly in her
own hands. Instead the other player, with his vicious reliability (Fatou
had long ago decided that both players were men), caught the shuttlecock
as it began to drift and sent it back to his opponent—another deathly,
downward smash.</p>
<p>0–9</p>
<p>No doubt there are those who will be critical of the narrow,
essentially local scope of Fatou’s interest in the Cambodian woman from
the Embassy of Cambodia, but we, the people of Willesden, have some
sympathy with her attitude. The fact is if we followed the history of
every little country in this world—in its dramatic as well as its quiet
times—we would have no space left in which to live our own lives or to
apply ourselves to our necessary tasks, never mind indulge in occasional
pleasures, like swimming. Surely there is something to be said for
drawing a circle around our attention and remaining within that circle.
But how large should this circle be?</p>
<p>0–10</p>
<p>It was the Sunday after Fatou saw the Cambodian that she decided to
put a version of this question to Andrew, as they sat in the Tunisian
café eating two large fingers of dough stuffed with cream and custard
and topped with a strip of chocolate icing. Specifically, she began a
conversation with Andrew about the Holocaust, as Andrew was the only
person she had found in London with whom she could have these deep
conversations, partly because he was patient and sympathetic to her, but
also because he was an educated person, currently studying for a
part-time business degree at the College of North West London. With his
student card he had been given free, twenty-four-hour access to the
Internet.</p>
<p>“But more people died in Rwanda,” Fatou argued. “And nobody speaks
about that! Nobody!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think that’s true,” Andrew conceded, and put the first of
four sugars in his coffee. “I have to check. But, yes, millions and
millions. They hide the true numbers, but you can see them online.
There’s always a lot of hiding; it’s the same all over. It’s like this
bureaucratic Nigerian government—they are the greatest at numerology,
hiding figures, changing them to suit their purposes. I have a name for
it: I call it ‘demonology.’ Not ‘numerology’—‘demonology.’ ”</p>
<p>“Yes, but what I am saying is like this,” Fatou pressed, wary of the
conversation’s drifting back, as it usually did, to the financial
corruption of the Nigerian government. “Are we born to suffer? Sometimes
I think we were born to suffer more than all the rest.”</p>
<p>Andrew pushed his professorial glasses up his nose. “But, Fatou,
you’re forgetting the most important thing. Who cried most for Jesus?
His mother. Who cries most for you? Your father. It’s very logical, when
you break it down. The Jews cry for the Jews. The Russians cry for the
Russians. We cry for Africa, because we are Africans, and, even then,
I’m sorry, Fatou”—Andrew’s chubby face creased up in a smile—“if Nigeria
plays Ivory Coast and we beat you into the ground, I’m laughing, man! I
can’t lie. I’m celebrating. Stomp! Stomp!” He did a little dance with
his upper body, and Fatou tried, not for the first time, to imagine what
he might be like as a husband, but could see only herself as the wife,
and Andrew as a teen-age son of hers, bright and helpful, to be sure,
but a son all the same—though in reality he was three years older than
she. Surely it was wrong to find his baby fat and struggling mustache so
off-putting. Here was a good man! She knew that he cared for her, was
clean, and had given his life to Christ. Still, some part of her
rebelled against him, some unholy part.</p>
<p>“Hush your mouth,” she said, trying to sound more playful than
disgusted, and was relieved when he stopped jiggling and laid both his
hands on the table, his face suddenly quite solemn.</p>
<p>“Believe me, that’s a natural law, Fatou, pure and simple. Only God
cries for us all, because we are all his children. It’s very, very
logical. You just have to think about it for a moment.”</p>
<p>Fatou sighed, and spooned some coffee foam into her mouth. “But I
still think we have more pain. I’ve seen it myself. Chinese people have
never been slaves. They are always protected from the worst.”</p>
<p>Andrew took off his glasses and rubbed them on the end of his shirt.
Fatou could tell that he was preparing to lay knowledge upon her.</p>
<p>“Fatou, think about it for a moment, please: what about
Hiroshima?”</p>
<p>It was a name Fatou had heard before, but sometimes Andrew’s superior
knowledge made her nervous. She would find herself struggling to
remember even the things she had believed she already knew.</p>
<p>“The big wave…” she began, uncertainly—it was the wrong answer. He
laughed mightily and shook his head at her.</p>
<p>“No, man! Big bomb. Biggest bomb in the world, made by the U.S.A., of
course. They killed five million people in one second. Can you imagine
that? You think just because your eyes are like this”—he tugged the skin
at both temples—“you’re always protected? Think again. This bomb, even
if it didn’t blow you up, a week later it melted the skin off your
bones.”</p>
<p>Fatou realized that she had heard this story before, or some version
of it. But she felt the same vague impatience with it as she did with
all accounts of suffering in the distant past. For what could be done
about the suffering of the past?</p>
<p>“O.K.,” she said. “Maybe all people have their hard times, in the
past of history, but I still say—”</p>
<p>“Here is a counterpoint,” Andrew said, reaching out and gripping her
shoulder. “Let me ask you, Fatou, seriously, think about this. I’m sorry
to interrupt you, but I have thought a lot about this and I want to pass
it on to you, because I know you care about things seriously, not like
these people.” He waved a hand at the assortment of cake eaters at other
tables. “You’re not like the other girls I know, just thinking about the
club and their hair. You’re a person who thinks. I told you before,
anything you want to know about, ask me—I’ll look it up, I’ll do the
research. I have access. Then I’ll bring it to you.”</p>
<p>“You’re a very good friend to me, Andrew, I know that.”</p>
<p>“Listen, we are friends to each other. In this world you need
friends. But, Fatou, listen to my question. It’s a counterpoint to what
you have been saying. Tell me, why would God choose us especially for
suffering when we, above all others, praise his name? Africa is the
fastest-growing Christian continent! Just think about it for a minute!
It doesn’t even make sense!”</p>
<p>“But it’s not him,” Fatou said quietly, looking over Andrew’s
shoulder at the rain beating on the window. “It’s the Devil.”</p>
<p>0–11</p>
<p>Andrew and Fatou sat in the Tunisian coffee shop, waiting for it to
stop raining, but it did not stop raining, and at 3 p.m. Fatou said she
would just have to get wet. She shared Andrew’s umbrella as far as the
Overground, letting him pull her into his clammy, high-smelling body as
they walked. At Brondesbury station Andrew had to get the train, and so
they said goodbye. Several times he tried to press his umbrella on her,
but Fatou knew the walk from Acton Central to Andrew’s bed-sit was long
and she refused to let him suffer on her account.</p>
<p>“Big woman. Won’t let anybody protect you.”</p>
<p>“Rain doesn’t scare me.”</p>
<p>Fatou took from her pocket a swimming cap she had found on the floor
of the health-club changing room. She wound her plaits into a bun and
pulled the cap over her head.</p>
<p>“That’s a very original idea,” Andrew said, laughing. “You should
market that! Make your first million!”</p>
<p>“Peace be with you,” Fatou said, and kissed him chastely on the
cheek. Andrew did the same, lingering a little longer with his kiss than
was necessary.</p>
<p>0–12</p>
<p>By the time Fatou reached the Derawals’, only her hair was dry, but
before going to get changed she rushed to the kitchen to take the lamb
out of the freezer, though it was pointless—there were not enough hours
before dinner—and then upstairs to collect the dirty clothes from the
matching wicker baskets in four different bedrooms. There was no one in
the master bedroom, or in Faizul’s, or Julie’s. Downstairs a television
was blaring. Entering Asma’s room, hearing nothing, assuming it empty,
Fatou headed straight for the laundry bin in the corner. As she opened
the lid she felt a hand hit her hard on the back; she turned around.</p>
<p>There was the youngest, Asma, in front of her, her mouth open like a
trout fish. Before Fatou could understand, Asma punched the huge pile of
clothes out of her hands. Fatou stooped to retrieve them. While she was
kneeling on the floor, another strike came, a kick to her arm. She left
the clothes where they were and got up, frightened by her own anger. But
when she looked at Asma now she saw the girl gesturing frantically at
her own throat, then putting her hands together in prayer, and then back
to her throat once more. Her eyes were bulging. She veered suddenly to
the right; she threw herself over the back of a chair. When she turned
back to Fatou her face was gray and Fatou understood finally and ran to
her, grabbed her round her waist, and pulled upward as she had been
taught in the hotel. A marble—with an iridescent ribbon of blue at its
center, like a wave—flew from the child’s mouth and landed wetly in the
carpet’s plush.</p>
<p>Asma wept and drew in frantic gulps of air. Fatou gave her a hug, and
worried when the clothes would get done. Together they went down to the
den, where the rest of the family was watching “Britain’s Got Talent” on
a flat-screen TV attached to the wall. Everybody stood at the sight of
Asma’s wild weeping. Mr. Derawal paused the Sky box. Fatou explained
about the marble.</p>
<p>“How many times I tell you not to put things in your mouth?”
Mr. Derawal asked, and Mrs. Derawal said something in their
language—Fatou heard the name of their God—and pulled Asma onto the sofa
and stroked her daughter’s silky black hair.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t breathe, man! I couldn’t call nobody,” Asma cried. “I was
gonna die!”</p>
<p>“What you putting marbles in your mouth for anyway, you idiot,”
Faizul said, and un-paused the Sky box. “What kind of chief puts a
marble in her mouth? Idiot. Bet you was bricking it.”</p>
<p>“Oi, she saved your life,” said Julie, the eldest child, whom Fatou
generally liked the least. “Fatou saved your life. That’s deep.”</p>
<p>“I woulda just done this,” Faizul said, and performed an especially
dramatic Heimlich to his own skinny body. “And if that didn’t work I
woulda just start pounding myself karate style, bam bam bam bam
bam—”</p>
<p>“Faizul!” Mr. Derawal shouted, and then turned stiffly to Fatou, and
spoke not to her, exactly, but to a point somewhere between her elbow
and the sunburst mirror behind her head. “Thank you, Fatou. It’s lucky
you were there.”</p>
<p>Fatou nodded and moved to leave, but at the doorway to the den
Mrs. Derawal asked her if the lamb had defrosted and Fatou had to
confess that she had only just taken it out. Mrs. Derawal said something
sharply in her language. Fatou waited for something further, but
Mr. Derawal only smiled awkwardly at her, and nodded as a sign that she
could go now. Fatou went upstairs to collect the clothes.</p>
<p>0–13</p>
<p>“To keep you is no benefit. To destroy you is no loss” was one of the
mottoes of the Khmer Rouge. It referred to the New People, those city
dwellers who could not be made to give up city life and work on a farm.
By returning everybody to the land, the regime hoped to create a society
of Old People—that is to say, of agrarian peasants. When a New Person
was relocated from the city to the country, it was vital not to show
weakness in the fields. Vulnerability was punishable by death.</p>
<p>In Willesden, we are almost all New People, though some of us, like
Fatou, were, until quite recently, Old People, working the land in our
various countries of origin. Of the Old and New People of Willesden I
speak; I have been chosen to speak for them, though they did not choose
me and must wonder what gives me the right. I could say, “Because I was
born at the crossroads of Willesden, Kilburn, and Queen’s Park!” But the
reply would be swift and damning: “Oh, don’t be foolish, many people
were born right there; it doesn’t mean anything at all. We are not one
people and no one can speak for us. It’s all a lot of nonsense. We see
you standing on the balcony, overlooking the Embassy of Cambodia, in
your dressing gown, staring into the chestnut trees, looking gormless.
The real reason you speak in this way is because you can’t think of
anything better to do.”</p>
<p>0–14</p>
<p>On Monday, Fatou went swimming. She paused to watch the badminton.
She thought that the arm that delivered the smashes must make a movement
similar to the one she made in the pool, with her clumsy yet effective
front crawl. She entered the health center and gave a guest pass to the
girl behind the desk. In the dimly lit changing room, she put on her
sturdy black underwear. As she swam, she thought of Carib Beach. Her
father serving snapper to the guests on the deck, his bow tie always a
little askew, the ugly tourists, the whole scene there. Of course, it
was not surprising in the least to see old white men from Germany with
beautiful local girls on their laps, but she would never forget the two
old white women from England—red women, really, thanks to the sun—each
of them as big as two women put together, with Kweku and Osai lying by
their sides, the boys hooking their scrawny black bird-arms round the
women’s massive red shoulders, dancing with them in the hotel
“ballroom,” answering to the names Michael and David, and disappearing
into the women’s cabins at night. She had known the boys’ real
girlfriends; they were chambermaids like Fatou. Sometimes they cleaned
the rooms where Kweku and Osai spent the night with the English women.
And the girls themselves had “boyfriends” among the guests. It was not a
holy place, that hotel. And the pool was shaped like a kidney bean:
nobody could really swim in it, or showed any sign of wanting to.
Mostly, they stood in it and drank cocktails. Sometimes they even had
their burgers delivered to the pool. Fatou hated to watch her father
crouching to hand a burger to a man waist high in water.</p>
<p>The only good thing that happened in Carib Beach was this: once a
month, on a Sunday, the congregation of a local church poured out of a
coach at the front gates, lined up fully dressed in the courtyard, and
then walked into the pool for a mass baptism. The tourists were never
warned, and Fatou never understood why the congregants were allowed to
do it. But she loved to watch their white shirts bloat and spread across
the surface of the water, and to hear the weeping and singing. At the
time—though she was not then a member of that church, or of any church
except the one in her heart—she had felt that this baptism was for her,
too, and that it kept her safe, and that this was somehow the reason she
did not become one of the “girls” at the Carib Beach Resort. For almost
two years—between her father’s efforts and the grace of an unseen and
unacknowledged God—she did her work, and swam Sunday mornings at the
crack of dawn, and got along all right. But the Devil was waiting.</p>
<p>She had only a month left in Accra when she entered a bedroom to
clean it one morning and heard the door shut softly behind her before
she could put a hand to it. He came, this time, in Russian form.
Afterward, he cried and begged her not to tell anyone: his wife had gone
to see the Cape Coast Castle and they were leaving the following
morning. Fatou listened to his blubbering and realized that he thought
the hotel would punish him for his action, or that the police would be
called. That was when she knew that the Devil was stupid as well as
evil. She spat in his face and left. Thinking about the Devil now made
her swimming fast and angry, and for a while she easily lapped the young
white man in the lane next to hers, the faster lane.</p>
<p>0–15</p>
<p>“Don’t give the Devil your anger, it is his food,” Andrew had said to
her, when they first met, a year ago. He handed her a leaflet as she sat
eating a sandwich on a bench in Kilburn Park. “Don’t make it so easy for
him.” Without being invited, he took the seat next to hers and began
going through the text of his leaflet. It was printed to look like a
newspaper, and he started with the headline: “Why Is There Pain?” She
liked him. They began a theological conversation. It continued in the
Tunisian café, and every Sunday for several months. A lot of the things
he said she had heard before from other people, and they did not succeed
in changing her attitude. In the end, it was one thing that he said to
her that really made the difference. It was after she’d told him this
story:</p>
<p>“One day, at the hotel, I heard a commotion on the beach. It was
early morning. I went out and I saw nine children washed up dead on the
beach. Ten or eleven years old, boys and girls. They had gone into the
water, but they didn’t know how to swim. Some people were crying, maybe
two people. Everyone else just shook their heads and carried on walking
to where they were going. After a long time, the police came. The bodies
were taken away. People said, ‘Well, they are with God now.’ Everybody
carried on like before. I went back to work. The next year I arrived in
Rome. I saw a boy who was about fifteen years old knocked down on his
bike. He was dead. People were screaming and crying in the street.
Everybody crying. They were not his family. They were only strangers.
The next day, it was in the paper.”</p>
<p>And Andrew replied, “A tap runs fast the first time you switch it
on.”</p>
<p>0–16</p>
<p>Twenty more laps. Fatou tried to think of the last time she had
cried. It was in Rome, but it wasn’t for the boy on the bike. She was
cleaning toilets in a Catholic girls’ school. She did not know Jesus
then, so it made no difference what kind of school it was—she knew only
that she was cleaning toilets. At midday, she had a fifteen-minute
break. She would go to the little walled garden across the road to smoke
a cigarette. One day, she was sitting on a bench near a fountain, and
spotted something odd in the bushes. A tin of green paint. A gold spray
can. A Statue of Liberty costume. An identity card with the name Rajib
Devanga. One shoe. An empty wallet. A plastic tub with a slit cut in the
top meant for coins and euro notes—empty. A little stain of what looked
like blood on this tub. Until that point, she had been envious of the
Bengali boys on Via Nazionale. She felt that she, too, could paint
herself green and stand still for an hour. But when she tried to find
out more the Bengalis would not talk to her. It was a closed shop, for
brown men only. Her place was in the bathroom stalls. She thought those
men had it easy. Then she saw that little sad pile of belongings in the
bush and cried; for herself or for Rajib, she wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>Now she turned onto her back in the water for the final two laps,
relaxed her arms, and kicked her feet out like a frog. Water made her
think of more water. “When you’re baptized in our church, all sin is
wiped, you start again”: Andrew’s promise. She had never told Andrew of
the sin precisely, but she knew that he knew she was not a virgin. The
day she finally became a Catholic, February 6, 2011, Andrew had taken
her, hair still wet, to the Tunisian café and asked her how it felt.</p>
<p>She was joyful! She said, “I feel like a new person!”</p>
<p>But happiness like that is hard to hold on to. Back at work the next
day, picking Julie’s dirty underwear up off the floor inches from the
wicker basket, she had to keep reminding herself of her new relationship
with Jesus and how it changed everything. Didn’t it change everything?
The following Sunday she expressed some of her doubt, cautiously, to
Andrew.</p>
<p>“But did you think you’d never feel sad again? Never angry or tired
or just pissed off—sorry about my language. Come on, Fatou! Wise up,
man!”</p>
<p>Was it wrong to hope to be happy?</p>
<p>0–17</p>
<p>Lost to these watery thoughts, Fatou got home a little later than
usual and was through the door only minutes before Mrs. Derawal.</p>
<p>“How is Asma?” Fatou asked. She had heard the girl cry out in the
night.</p>
<p>“My goodness, it was just a little marble,” Mrs. Derawal said, and
Fatou realized that it was not in her imagination: since Sunday night,
neither of the adult Derawals had been able to look her in the eye.
“What a fuss everybody is making. I have a list for you—it’s on the
table.”</p>
<p>0–18</p>
<p>Fatou watched Andrew pick his way through the tables in the Tunisian
café, holding a tray with a pair of mochas on it and some croissants. He
hit the elbow of one man with his backside and then trailed the belt of
his long, silly leather coat through the lunch of another, apologizing
as he went. You could not say that he was an elegant man. But he was
generous, he was thoughtful. She stood up to push a teetering croissant
back onto its plate. They sat down at the same time, and smiled at each
other.</p>
<p>“Awhile ago you asked me about Cambodia,” Andrew said. “Well, it’s a
very interesting case.” He tapped the frame of his glasses. “If you even
wore a pair of these? They would kill you. Glasses meant you thought too
much. They had very primitive ideas. They were enemies of logic and
progress. They wanted everybody to go back to the country and live like
simple people.”</p>
<p>“But sometimes it’s true that things are simpler in the country.”</p>
<p>“In some ways. I don’t really know. I’ve never lived in the
country.”</p>
<p>I don’t really know. It was good to hear him say that! It was a good
sign. She smiled cheekily at him. “People are less sinful in the
country,” she said, but he did not seem to see that she was flirting
with him, and embarked on another lecture:</p>
<p>“That’s true. But you can’t force people to live in the country.
That’s what I call a Big Man Policy. I invented this phrase for my
dissertation. We know all about Big Man Policies in Nigeria. They come
from the top, and they crush you. There’s always somebody who wants to
be the Big Man, and take everything for himself, and tell everybody how
to think and what to do. When, actually, it’s he who is weak. But if the
Big Men see that you see that they are weak they have no choice but to
destroy you. That is the real tragedy.”</p>
<p>Fatou sighed. “I never met a man who didn’t want to tell everybody
how to think and what to do,” she said.</p>
<p>Andrew laughed. “Fatou, you include me? Are you a feminist now,
too?”</p>
<p>Fatou brought her mug up to her lips and looked penetratingly at
Andrew. There were good and bad kinds of weakness in men, and she had
come to the conclusion that the key was to know which kind you were
dealing with.</p>
<p>“Andrew,” she said, putting her hand on his, “would you like to come
swimming with me?”</p>
<p>0–19</p>
<p>Because Fatou believed that the Derawals’ neighbors had been
instructed to spy on her, she would not let Andrew come to the house to
pick her up on Monday, instead leaving as she always did, just before
ten, carrying misleading Sainsbury’s bags and walking toward the health
center. She spotted him from a long way off—the road was so straight and
he had arrived early. He stood shivering in the drizzle. She felt sorry,
but also a little prideful: it was the prospect of seeing her body that
had raised this big man from his bed. Still, it was a sacrifice, she
knew, for her friend to come out to meet her on a weekday morning. He
worked all night long and kept the daytime for sleeping. She watched him
waving at her from their agreed meeting spot, just on the corner, in
front of the Embassy of Cambodia. After a while, he stopped
waving—because she was still so far away—and then, a little later, he
began waving again. She waved back, and when she finally reached him
they surprised each other by holding hands. “I’m an excellent badminton
player,” Andrew said, as they passed the Embassy of Cambodia. “I would
make you weep for mercy! Next time, instead of swimming we should play
badminton somewhere.” Next time, we should go to Paris. Next time, we
should go to the moon. He was a dreamer. But there are worse things,
Fatou thought, than being a dreamer.</p>
<p>0–20</p>
<p>“So you’re a guest and this is your guest?” the girl behind the desk
asked.</p>
<p>“I am a guest and this is another guest,” Fatou replied.</p>
<p>“Yeah…that’s not really how it works?”</p>
<p>“Please,” Fatou said. “We’ve come from a long way.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate that,” the girl said. “But I really shouldn’t let you
in, to be honest.”</p>
<p>“Please,” Fatou said again. She could think of no other argument.</p>
<p>The girl took out a pen and made a mark on Fatou’s guest pass.</p>
<p>“This one time. Don’t tell no one I did this, please. One time only!
I’ll need to cross off two separate visits.”</p>
<p>For one time only, then, Andrew and Fatou approached the changing
rooms together and parted at the doors that led to the men’s and the
women’s. In her changing room, Fatou got ready with lightning speed. Yet
somehow he was already there on a lounger when she came out, eyes
trained on the women’s changing-room door, waiting for her to
emerge.</p>
<p>“Man, this is the life!” he said, putting his arms behind his
head.</p>
<p>“Are you getting in?” Fatou asked, and tried to place her hands,
casually, in front of her groin.</p>
<p>“Not yet, man, I’m just taking it all in, taking it all in. You go
in. I’ll come in a moment.”</p>
<p>Fatou climbed down the steps and began to swim. Not elegant, not
especially fast, but consistent and determined. Every now and then she
would angle her head to try to see if Andrew was still on his chair,
smiling to himself. After twenty laps, she swam to where he lay and put
her elbows on the tiles.</p>
<p>“You’re not coming in? It’s so warm. Like a bath.”</p>
<p>“Sure, sure,” he said. “I’ll try it.”</p>
<p>As he sat up his stomach folded in on itself, and Fatou wondered
whether he had spent all that time on the lounger to avoid her seeing
its precise bulk and wobble. He came toward the stairs; Fatou held out a
hand to him, but he pushed it away. He made his way down and stood in
the shallow end, splashing water over his shoulders like a prince
fanning himself, and then crouching down into it.</p>
<p>“It is warm! Very nice. This is the life, man! You go, swim—I’ll
follow you.”</p>
<p>Fatou kicked off, creating so much splash that she heard someone in
the adjacent lane complain. At the wall, she turned and looked for
Andrew. His method, such as it was, involved dipping deep under the
water and hanging there like a hippo, then batting his arms till he
crested for air, and then diving down again and hanging. It was a lot of
energy to expend on such a short distance, and by the time he reached
the wall he was panting like a maniac. His eyes—he had no goggles—were
painfully red.</p>
<p>“It’s O.K.,” Fatou said, trying to take his hand again. “If you let
me, I’ll show you how.” But he shrugged her off, and rubbed at his
eyes.</p>
<p>“There’s too much bloody chlorine in this pool.”</p>
<p>“You want to leave?”</p>
<p>Andrew turned back to look at Fatou. His eyes were streaming. He
looked, to Fatou, like a little boy trying to disguise the fact he had
been crying. But then he held her hand, under the water.</p>
<p>“No. I’m just going to take it easy right here.”</p>
<p>“O.K.,” Fatou said.</p>
<p>“You swim. You’re good. You swim.”</p>
<p>“O.K.,” Fatou said, and set off, and found that each lap was more
distracted and rhythmless than the last. She was not used to being
watched while she swam. Ten laps later, she suddenly stood up halfway
down the lane and walked the rest of the distance to the wall.</p>
<p>“You want to go in the Jacuzzi?” she asked him, pointing to it. In
the hot tub sat a woman dressed in a soaking tracksuit, her head covered
with a head scarf. A man next to the woman, perhaps her husband, stared
at Fatou and said something to her. He was so hairy he was almost as
covered as she was. Together they rose up out of the water and left. He
was wearing the tiniest of Speedos, the kind Fatou had feared Andrew
might wear, and was grateful he had not. Andrew’s shorts were perfectly
nice, knee length, red and solid, and looked good against his skin.</p>
<p>“No,” Andrew said. “It’s great just to be here with you, watching the
world go by.”</p>
<p>0–21</p>
<p>That same evening, Fatou was fired. Not for the guest passes—the
Derawals never found out how many miles Fatou had travelled on their
membership. In fact, it was hard for Fatou to understand exactly why she
was being fired, as Mrs. Derawal herself did not seem able to explain it
very precisely.</p>
<p>“What you don’t understand is that we have no need for a nanny,” she
said, standing in the doorway of Fatou’s room—there was not really
enough space in there for two people to stand without one of them being
practically on the bed. “The children are grown. We need a housekeeper,
one who cleans properly. These days, you care more about the children
than the cleaning,” Mrs. Derawal added, though Fatou had never cared for
the children, not even slightly. “And that is of no use to us.”</p>
<p>Fatou said nothing. She was thinking that she did not have a proper
suitcase and would have to take her things from Mrs. Derawal’s house in
plastic bags.</p>
<p>“And so you will want to find somewhere else to live as soon as
possible,” Mrs. Derawal said. “My husband’s cousin is coming to stay in
this room on Friday—this Friday.”</p>
<p>Fatou thought about that for a moment. Then she said, “Can I please
use the phone for one call?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Derawal inspected a piece of wood that had flaked from the
doorframe. But she nodded.</p>
<p>“And I would like to have my passport, please.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“My passport, please.”</p>
<p>At last Mrs. Derawal looked at Fatou, right into her eyes, but her
face was twisted, as if Fatou had just reached over and slapped her.
Anyone could see the Devil had climbed inside poor Mrs. Derawal. He was
lighting her up with a pure fury.</p>
<p>“For goodness’ sake, girl, I don’t have your passport! What would I
want with your passport? It’s probably in a drawer in the kitchen
somewhere. Is that my job now, too, to look for your things?”</p>
<p>Fatou was left alone. She packed her things into the decoy shopping
bags she usually took to the swimming pool. While she was doing this,
someone pushed her passport under the door. An hour later, she carried
her bags downstairs and went directly to the phone in the hall. Faizul
walked by and lifted his hand for a high-five. Fatou ignored him and
dialled Andrew’s number. From her friend’s voice she knew that she had
woken him, but he was not even the slightest bit angry. He listened to
all she had to say and seemed to understand, too, without her having to
say so, that at this moment she could not speak freely. After she had
said her part, he asked a few quick technical questions and then
explained clearly and carefully what was to happen.</p>
<p>“It will all be O.K. They need cleaners in my offices—I will ask for
you. In the meantime, you come here. We’ll sleep in shifts. You can
trust me. I respect you, Fatou.”</p>
<p>But she did not have her Oyster Card; it was in the kitchen, on the
fridge under a magnet of Florida, and she would rather die than go in
there. Fine: he could meet her at 6 p.m., at the Brondesbury Overground
station. Fatou looked at the grandfather clock in front of her: she had
four hours to kill.</p>
<p>“Six o’ clock,” she repeated. She put the phone down, took the rest
of the guest passes from the drawer of the Louis XVI console, and left
the house.</p>
<p>“Weighed down a bit today,” the girl at the desk of the health club
said, nodding at Fatou’s collection of plastic bags. Fatou held out a
guest pass for a stamp and did not smile. “See you next time,” this same
girl said, an hour and a half later, as Fatou strode past, still weighed
down and still unwilling to be grateful for past favors. Gratitude was
just another kind of servitude. Better to make your own
arrangements.</p>
<p>Walking out into the cold gray, Fatou felt a sense of brightness, of
being washed clean, that neither the weather nor her new circumstance
could dim. Still, her limbs were weary and her hair was wet; she would
probably catch a cold, waiting out here. It was only four-thirty. She
put her bags on the pavement and sat down next to them, just by the bus
stop opposite the Embassy of Cambodia. Buses came and went, slowing down
for her and then jerking forward when they realized that she had no
interest in getting up and on. Many of us walked past her that
afternoon, or spotted her as we rode the bus, or through the windscreens
of our cars, or from our balconies. Naturally, we wondered what this
girl was doing, sitting on damp pavement in the middle of the day. We
worried for her. We tend to assume the worst, here in Willesden. We
watched her watching the shuttlecock. Pock, smash. Pock, smash. As if
one player could imagine only a violent conclusion and the other only a
hopeful return.</p>
