<h4 id="chicxulub">Chicxulub</h4>
<p>By T. Coraghessan Boyle (2004)</p>
<p>My daughter is walking along the roadside late at night—too late,
really, for a seventeen-year-old to be out alone, even in a town as safe
as this—and it is raining, the first rain of the season, the streets
slick with a fine immiscible glaze of water and petrochemicals, so that
even a driver in full possession of her faculties, a driver who hadn’t
consumed two apple Martinis and three glasses of Hitching Post pinot
noir before she got behind the wheel of her car, would have trouble
keeping the thing out of the gutters and the shrubbery, off the sidewalk
and the highway median, for Christ’s sake…. But that’s not really what I
want to talk about, or not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>Have you heard of Tunguska? In Russia?</p>
<p>This was the site of the last known large-body impact on the Earth’s
surface, nearly a hundred years ago. Or that’s not strictly accurate—the
meteor, which was an estimated sixty yards across, never actually
touched down. The force of its entry—the compression and superheating of
the air beneath it—caused it to explode some twenty-five thousand feet
above the ground, but then the term “explode” hardly does justice to the
event. There was a detonation—a flash, a thunderclap—with the combustive
power of eight hundred Hiroshima bombs. Thirty miles away, reindeer in
their loping herds were struck dead by the blast wave, and the clothes
of a hunter another thirty miles beyond that burst into flame even as he
was poleaxed to the ground. Seven hundred square miles of Siberian
forest were levelled in an instant. If the meteor had struck just five
hours later, it would have exploded over St. Petersburg and annihilated
every living thing in that glorious, baroque city. And this was only a
rock. And it was only sixty yards across.</p>
<p>My point? You’d better get down on your knees and pray to your gods,
because each year this big spinning globe we ride intersects the orbits
of some twenty million asteroids, at least a thousand of which are more
than half a mile in diameter.</p>
<p>But my daughter. She’s out there in the dark and the rain, walking
home. Maureen and I bought her a car, a Honda Civic, the safest thing on
four wheels, but the car was used—pre-owned, in dealerspeak—and as it
happens it’s in the shop with transmission problems and, because she
just had to see her friends and gossip and giggle and balance slick
multicolored clumps of raw fish and pickled ginger on conjoined
chopsticks at the mall, Kimberly picked her up and Kimberly will bring
her home. Maddy has a cell phone and theoretically she could have called
us, but she didn’t—or that’s how it appears. And so she’s walking. In
the rain. And Alice K. Petermann, of 16 Briar Lane, white, divorced, a
Realtor with Hyperion, who has picked at a salad and left her glasses on
the bar, loses control of her vehicle.</p>
<p>It is just past midnight. I am in bed with a book, naked, and hardly
able to focus on the clustered words and rigid descending paragraphs,
because Maureen is in the bathroom slipping into the sheer black
negligee I bought her at Victoria’s Secret for her birthday, and her
every sound—the creak of the medicine cabinet on its hinges, the tap
running, the susurrus of the brush at her teeth—electrifies me. I’ve lit
a candle and am waiting for Maureen to step into the room so that I can
flick off the light. We had cocktails earlier, and a bottle of wine with
dinner, and we sat close on the couch and shared a joint in front of the
fire, because our daughter was out and we could do that with no one the
wiser. I listen to the little sounds from the bathroom, seductive
sounds, maddening. I am ready. More than ready. “Hey,” I call, pitching
my voice low, “are you coming or not? You don’t expect me to wait all
night, do you?”</p>
<p>Her face appears in the doorway, the pale lobes of her breasts and
the dark nipples visible through the clinging black silk. “Oh, are you
waiting for me?” she says, making a game of it. She hovers at the door,
and I can see the smile creep across her lips, the pleasure of the
moment, drawing it out. “Because I thought I might go down and work in
the garden for a while—it won’t take long, a couple hours, maybe. You
know, spread a little manure, bank up some of the mulch on the roses.
You’ll wait for me, won’t you?”</p>
<p>Then the phone rings.</p>
<p>We stare blankly at each other through the first two rings and then
Maureen says, “I’d better get it,” and I say, “No, no, forget it—it’s
nothing. It’s nobody.”</p>
<p>But she’s already moving.</p>
<p>“Forget it!” I shout, and her voice drifts back to me—“What if it’s
Maddy?”—then I watch her put her lips to the receiver and whisper,
“Hello?”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The night of the Tunguska explosion the skies were unnaturally bright
across Europe—as far away as London people strolled in the parks past
midnight and read novels out of doors while the sheep kept right on
grazing and the birds stirred uneasily in the trees. There were no stars
visible, no moon—just a pale, quivering light, as if all the color had
been bleached out of the sky. But, of course, that midnight glow and the
fate of those unhappy Siberian reindeer were nothing at all compared to
what would have happened if a larger object had invaded the Earth’s
atmosphere. On average, objects greater than a hundred yards in diameter
strike the planet once every five thousand years, and asteroids half a
mile across thunder down at intervals of three hundred thousand years.
Three hundred thousand years is a long time in anybody’s book. But
if—when—such a collision occurs, the explosion will be in the
million-megaton range and will cloak the atmosphere in dust, thrusting
the entire planet into a deep freeze and effectively stifling all plant
growth for a period of a year or more. There will be no crops. No
forage. No sun.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>There has been an accident, that is what the voice on the other end
of the line is telling my wife, and the victim is Madeline Biehn, of
1337 Laurel Drive, according to the I.D. the paramedics found in her
purse. (The purse, with a silver clasp that has been driven half an inch
into the flesh under her arm by the force of the impact, is a little
thing, no bigger than a hardcover book, with a ribbon-thin strap, the
same purse all the girls carry, as if it were part of a uniform.) Is
this her parent or guardian speaking?</p>
<p>I hear my wife say, “This is her mother.” And then, the bottom
dropping out of her voice, “Is she—?”</p>
<p>Is she? They don’t answer such questions, don’t volunteer
information, not over the phone. The next ten seconds are thunderous,
cataclysmic, my wife standing there numbly with the phone in her hand as
if it were some unidentifiable object she’d found in the street while I
fumble out of bed to search for my pants—and my shoes, where are my
shoes? The car keys? My wallet? This is the true panic, the loss of
faith and control, the punch to the heart, and the struggle for breath.
I say the only thing I can think to say, just to hear my own voice, just
to get things straight: “She was in an accident. Is that what they
said?”</p>
<p>“She was hit by a car. She’s—they don’t know. In surgery.”</p>
<p>“What hospital? Did they say what hospital?”</p>
<p>My wife is in motion now, too, the negligee ridiculous, unequal to
the task, and she jerks it over her head and flings it to the floor even
as she snatches up a blouse, shorts, flip-flops—anything, anything to
cover her nakedness and get her out the door. The dog is whining in the
kitchen. There is the sound of rain on the roof, intensifying, hammering
at the gutters. I don’t bother with shoes—there are no shoes, shoes do
not exist—and my shirt hangs limply from my shoulders, misbuttoned,
sagging, tails hanging loose, and we’re in the car now and the
driver’s-side wiper is beating out of synch and the night closing on us
like a fist.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>And then there’s Chicxulub. Sixty-five million years ago, an asteroid
(or perhaps a comet—no one is quite certain) collided with the Earth on
what is now the Yucatán Peninsula. Judging from the impact crater, which
is a hundred and twenty miles wide, the object—this big flaming ball—was
some six miles across. When it came down, day became night and that
night extended so far into the future that at least seventy-five per
cent of all known species were extinguished, including the dinosaurs in
nearly all their forms and array and some ninety per cent of the oceans’
plankton, which in turn devastated the pelagic food chain. How fast was
it travelling? The nearest estimates put it at fifty-four thousand miles
an hour, more than sixty times the speed of a bullet. Astrophysicists
call such objects “civilization enders,” and calculate the chances that
a disaster of this magnitude will occur during any individual’s lifetime
at roughly one in ten thousand, the same odds as dying in an auto
accident in the next six months—or, more tellingly, living to be a
hundred in the company of your spouse.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>All I see is windows, an endless grid of lit windows climbing one
above the other into the night, as the car shoots into the Emergency
Vehicles Only lane and slides in hard against the curb. Both doors fling
open simultaneously. Maureen is already out on the sidewalk, already
slamming the door behind her and breaking into a trot, and I’m right on
her heels, the keys still in the ignition and the lights stabbing at the
pale underbelly of a diagonally parked ambulance—and they can have the
car, anybody can have it and keep it forever, if they’ll just tell me
that my daughter is all right. “Just tell me,” I mutter, out of breath,
“just tell me and it’s yours,” and this is a prayer, the first in a long
discontinuous string, addressed to whoever or whatever may be listening.
Overhead, the sky is having a seizure, black above, quicksilver below,
the rain coming down in windblown arcs, and I wouldn’t even notice but
for the fact that we are suddenly—instantly—wet, our hair knotted and
clinging and our clothes stuck like flypaper to the slick tegument of
our skin.</p>
<p>In we come, side by side, through the doors that jolt back from us in
alarm, and all I can think is that the hospital is a death factory and
that we have come to it like the walking dead, haggard, sallow,
shoeless. “My daughter,” I say to the nurse at the admittance desk,
“she’s—they called. You called. She’s been in an accident.”</p>
<p>Maureen is at my side, tugging at the fingers of one hand as if she
were trying to remove an invisible glove. “A car. A car accident.”</p>
<p>“Name?” the nurse asks. About this nurse: she’s young, Filipina, with
opaque eyes and the bone structure of a cadaver; every day she sees
death and it blinds her. She doesn’t see us. She sees a computer screen;
she sees the TV monitor mounted in the corner and the shadows that pass
there; she sees the walls, the floor, the naked light of the fluorescent
tube. But not us. Not us.</p>
<p>For one resounding moment that thumps in my ears and then thumps
again, I can’t remember my daughter’s name—I can picture her leaning
into the mound of textbooks spread out on the dining-room table, the
glow of the overhead light making a nimbus of her hair as she glances up
at me with a glum look and half a rueful smile, as if to say, It’s all
in a day’s work for a teen-ager, Dad, and you’re lucky you’re not in
high school anymore, but her name is gone.</p>
<p>“Maddy,” my wife says. “Madeline Biehn.”</p>
<p>I watch, mesmerized, as the nurse’s fleshless fingers maneuver the
mouse, her eyes locked on the screen before her. A click. Another click.
The eyes lift to take us in, even as they dodge away again. “She’s still
in surgery,” she says.</p>
<p>“Where is it?” I demand. “What room? Where do we go?”</p>
<p>Maureen’s voice cuts in then, elemental, chilling, and it’s not a
question she’s posing, not a statement or demand, but a plea: “What’s
wrong with her?”</p>
<p>Another click, but this one is just for show, and the eyes never move
from the screen. “There was an accident,” the nurse says. “She was
brought in by the paramedics. That’s all I can tell you.”</p>
<p>It is then that I become aware that we are not alone, that there are
others milling around the room—other zombies like us, hurriedly dressed
and streaming water till the beige carpet is black with it—and why, I
wonder, do I despise this nurse more than any human being I’ve ever
encountered, this young woman not much older than my daughter, with her
hair pulled back in a bun and a white cap like a party favor perched
atop it, who is just doing her job? Why do I want to reach across the
counter that separates us and awaken her to a swift, sure knowledge of
hate and fear and pain? Why?</p>
<p>“Ted,” Maureen says, and I feel her grip at my elbow, and then we’re
moving again—hurrying, sweeping, practically running—out of this place,
down a corridor under the glare of the lights that are a kind of death
in themselves, and into a worse place, a far worse place.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The thing that disturbs me about Chicxulub, aside from the fact that
it erased the dinosaurs and wrought catastrophic and irreversible
change, is the deeper implication that we, and all our works and worries
and attachments, are so utterly inconsequential. Death cancels our
individuality, we know that, yes, but ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,
and the kind goes on, human life and culture succeed us. That, in the
absence of God, is what allows us to accept the death of the individual.
But when you throw Chicxulub into the mix—or the next Chicxulub, the
Chicxulub that could come howling down to obliterate all and everything
even as your eyes skim the lines of this page—where does that leave
us?</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>“You’re the parents?” We are in another room, gone deeper now, the
loudspeakers murmuring their eternal incantations—Dr. Chandrasoma to
Emergency, Dr. Bell, Paging Dr. Bell—and here is another nurse, grimmer,
older, with lines like the strings of a tobacco pouch pulled tight
around her lips. She’s addressing us, me and my wife, but I have nothing
to say, either in denial or affirmation. If I claim Maddy as my own—and
I’m making deals again—then I’m sure to jinx her, because those powers
that might or might not be, those gods of the infinite and the minute,
will see how desperately I love her and they’ll take her away just to
spite me for refusing to believe in them. Voodoo, Hoodoo, Santería,
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I hear Maureen’s voice, emerging
from a locked vault, the single whispered monosyllable, and then: “Is
she going to be all right?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have that information,” the nurse says, and her voice is
neutral, robotic even. This is not her daughter. Her daughter’s at home,
asleep in a pile of Teddy bears, pink sheets, fluffy pillows, the
night-light glowing like the all-seeing eye of a sentinel.</p>
<p>I can’t help myself. It’s that neutrality, that maddening clinical
neutrality, and can’t anybody take any responsibility for anything?
“What information do you have?” I say, and maybe I’m too loud, maybe I
am. “Isn’t that your job, for Christ’s sake—to know what’s going on
here? You call us up in the middle of the night—our daughter’s hurt,
she’s been in an accident, and you tell me you don’t have any fucking
information?”</p>
<p>People turn their heads, eyes burn into us. They’re slouched in
orange plastic chairs, stretched out on the floor, praying, pacing,
their lips moving in silence. They want information, too. We all want
information. We want news, good news: it was all a mistake, minor cuts
and bruises—contusions, that’s the word—and your daughter, son, husband,
grandmother, first cousin twice removed will be walking through that
door over there any minute….</p>
<p>The nurse drills me with a look, and then she’s coming out from
behind the desk, a short woman, dumpy—almost a dwarf—and striding
briskly to a door, which swings open on another room, deeper yet. “If
you’ll just follow me, please,” she says.</p>
<p>Suddenly sheepish, I duck my head and comply, two steps behind
Maureen. This room is smaller, an examining room, with a set of scales
and charts on the walls and its slab of a table covered with a sheet of
antiseptic paper. “Wait here,” the nurse tells us, already shifting her
weight to make her escape. “The doctor will be in in a minute.”</p>
<p>“What doctor?” I want to know. “What for? What does he want?”</p>
<p>But the door has already drawn closed.</p>
<p>I turn to Maureen. She’s standing there in the middle of the room,
afraid to touch anything or to sit down or even to move for fear of
breaking the spell. She’s listening for footsteps, her eyes fixed on the
door. I hear myself murmur her name, and then she’s in my arms, sobbing,
and I know I should hold her, know that we both need it, the human
contact, the love and support, but all I feel is the burden of her—there
is nothing and no one that can make this better, can’t she see that? I
don’t want to console or be consoled. I don’t want to be touched. I just
want my daughter back.</p>
<p>Maureen’s voice comes from so deep in her throat I can barely make
out what she’s saying. It takes a second to register, even as she pulls
away from me, her face crumpled and red, and this is her prayer,
whispered aloud: “She’s going to be all right, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I say, “sure she is. She’ll be fine. She’ll have some
bruises, that’s for sure, maybe a couple broken bones even…” and I trail
off, trying to picture it, the crutches, the cast, the Band-Aids, the
gauze: our daughter returned to us in a halo of shimmering light.</p>
<p>“Maybe she broke her arm—she could break her arm. That would— Or her
leg, even her leg. But why would she be in surgery? Why would she be in
surgery so long? Why? Why would that be?”</p>
<p>I don’t have an answer to that. I don’t want to have an answer.</p>
<p>“It was a car,” Maureen says. “A car, Ted. A car hit her.”</p>
<p>The room seems to tick and buzz with the fading energy of the larger
edifice, and I can’t help thinking of the congeries of wires strung
inside the walls, the cables bringing power to the X-ray lab, the EKG
and EEG machines, the life-support systems, and of the myriad pipes and
the fluids that they drain.</p>
<p>A car. Three thousand pounds of steel, chrome, glass, iron.</p>
<p>“What was she even doing walking like that? She knows better than
that.”</p>
<p>My wife nods, the wet ropes of her hair beating at her shoulders like
the flails of the penitents. “She probably had a fight with
Kimberly—I’ll bet that’s it. I’ll bet anything.”</p>
<p>“Where is the son of a bitch?” I snarl. “This doctor—where is
he?”</p>
<p>We are in that room, in that purgatory of a room, for a good hour or
more. Twice I thrust my head out the door to give the nurse an
annihilating look, but there is no news, no doctor, nothing. And then,
at quarter past two, the inner door swings open, and there he is, a man
too young to be a doctor, an infant with a smooth bland face and hair
that rides a wave up off his brow, and he doesn’t have to say a thing,
not a word, because I can see what he’s bringing us and my heart seizes
with the shock of it. He looks to Maureen, looks to me, then drops his
eyes. “I’m sorry,” he says.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>When it comes, the meteor will punch through the atmosphere and
strike the Earth in the space of a single second, vaporizing on impact
and creating a fireball that will in that moment achieve temperatures of
sixty thousand degrees Kelvin, or ten times the surface reading of the
sun. If it is Chicxulub-size and it hits one of our landmasses, some two
hundred thousand cubic kilometres of the Earth’s surface will be thrust
up into the atmosphere, even as the thermal radiation of the blast sets
fire to the Earth’s cities and forests. This will be succeeded by
seismic and volcanic activity on a scale unknown in human history, and
then the dark night of cosmic winter. If it should land in the sea, as
the Chicxulub meteor did, it would spew superheated water into the
atmosphere, instead, extinguishing the light of the sun and triggering
the same scenario of seismic catastrophe and eternal winter, while
simultaneously sending out a rippling ring of water three miles high to
rock the continents as if they were saucers in a dishpan.</p>
<p>So what does it matter? What does anything matter? We are powerless.
We are bereft. And the gods—all the gods of all the ages combined—are
nothing but a rumor.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The gurney is the focal point in a room of gurneys, people laid out
as if there’d been a war, the beaked noses of the victims poking up out
of the maze of sheets like a series of topographic blips on a glaciated
plain. These people are alive still, fluids dripping into their veins,
machines monitoring their vital signs, nurses hovering over them like
ghouls, but they’ll be dead soon, all of them. That much is clear. But
the gurney, the one against the back wall with the sheet pulled up over
the impossibly small and reduced form—this is all that matters. The
doctor leads us across the room, speaking in a low voice of internal
injuries, a ruptured spleen, trauma, the brain stem, and I can barely
control my feet.</p>
<p>Can I tell you how hard it is to lift this sheet? Thin percale, and
it might as well be made of lead, iron, iridium, might as well be the
repository of all the dark matter in the universe. The doctor steps
back, hands folded before him. The entire room or triage ward or
whatever it is holds its breath. Maureen moves in beside me till our
shoulders are touching, till I can feel the flesh and the heat of her
pressing into me, and I think of this child we made together, this thing
under the sheet, and the hand clenches at the end of my arm, the fingers
there, prehensile, taking hold. The sheet draws back millimetre by
millimetre, the slow striptease of death—and I can’t do this, I
can’t—until Maureen lunges forward and jerks the thing off in a single
violent motion.</p>
<p>It takes us a moment—the shock of the bloated and discolored flesh,
the crusted mat of blood at the temple and the rag of the hair, this
obscene violation of everything we know and expect and love—before the
surge of joy hits us. Maddy is a redhead, like her mother, and though
she’s seventeen, she’s as rangy and thin as a child, with oversized
hands and feet, and she never did pierce that smooth sweet run of flesh
beneath her lower lip. I can’t speak. I’m rushing still with the
euphoria of this new mainline drug I’ve discovered, soaring over the
room, the hospital, the whole planet. Maureen says it for me: “This is
not our daughter.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Our daughter is not in the hospital. Our daughter is asleep in her
room beneath the benevolent gaze of the posters on the wall—Britney and
Brad and Justin—her things scattered around her as if laid out for a
rummage sale. Our daughter has in fact gone to Hana Sushi at the mall,
as planned, and Kimberly has driven her home. Our daughter has,
unbeknownst to us or anyone else, fudged the rules a bit—the smallest
thing in the world, nothing really, the sort of thing every teen-ager
does without thinking twice. She has loaned her I.D. to her second-best
friend, Kristi Cherwin, because Kristi is sixteen and Kristi wants to
see—is dying to see—the movie at the Cineplex with Brad Pitt in it, the
one rated NC-17. Our daughter doesn’t know that we’ve been to the
hospital, doesn’t know about Alice K. Petermann and the pinot noir and
the glasses left on the bar, doesn’t know that even now the phone is
ringing at the Cherwins’.</p>
<p>I am sitting on the couch with a drink, staring into the ashes of the
fire. Maureen is in the kitchen with a mug of Ovaltine, gazing vacantly
out the window where the first streaks of light have begun to limn the
trunks of the trees. I try to picture the Cherwins—they’ve been to the
house a few times, Ed and Lucinda—and I draw a blank until a backlit
scene from the past presents itself, a cookout at their place, the
adults gathered around the grill with gin-and-tonics, the radio playing
some forgotten song, the children, our daughters, riding their bikes up
and down the cobbled drive, making a game of it, spinning, dodging,
lifting the front wheels from the ground even as their hair fans out
behind them and the sun crashes through the trees. Flip a coin ten times
and it could turn up heads ten times in a row—or not once. The rock is
coming, the new Chicxulub, hurtling through the dark and the cold to
remake our fate. But not tonight. Not for me.</p>
<p>For the Cherwins, it’s already here.</p>
