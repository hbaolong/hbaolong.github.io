<h4 id="the-cafeteria">The Cafeteria</h4>
<p>By Isaac Bashevis Singer (1968)</p>
<p>Even though I have reached the point where a great part of my
earnings is given away in taxes, I still have the habit of eating in
cafeterias when I am by myself. I like to take a tray with a tin knife,
fork, spoon, and paper napkin and to choose at the counter the food I
enjoy. Besides, I meet there the landsleit from Poland, as well as all
kinds of literary beginners and readers who know Yiddish. The moment I
sit down at a table, they come over. “Hello, Aaron!” They greet me, and
we talk about Yiddish literature, the Holocaust, the state of Israel,
and often about acquaintances who were eating rice pudding or stewed
prunes the last time I was here and are already in their graves. Since I
seldom read a paper, I learn this news only later. Each time, I am
startled, but at my age one has to be ready for such tidings. The food
sticks in the throat; we look at one another in confusion, and our eyes
ask mutely, Whose turn is next? Soon we begin to chew again. I am often
reminded of a scene in a film about Africa. A lion attacks a herd of
zebras and kills one. The frightened zebras run for a while and then
they stop and start to graze again. Do they have a choice?</p>
<p>I cannot spend too long with these Yiddishists, because I am always
busy. I am writing a novel, a story, an article. I have to lecture today
or tomorrow; my datebook is crowded with all kinds of appointments for
weeks and months in advance. It can happen that an hour after I leave
the cafeteria I am on a train to Chicago or flying to California. But
meanwhile we converse in the mother language and I hear of intrigues and
pettiness about which, from a moral point of view, it would be better
not to be informed. Everyone tries in his own way with all his means to
grab as many honors and as much love and prestige as he can. None of us
learns from all these deaths. Old age does not cleanse us. We don’t
repent at the gate of Hell.</p>
<p>I have been moving around in this neighborhood for over thirty
years—as long as I lived in Poland. I know each block, each house. There
has been little building here on uptown Broadway in the last decades,
and I have the illusion of having put down roots here. I have spoken in
most of the synagogues. They know me in some of the stores and in the
vegetarian restaurants. Women with whom I have had affairs live on the
side streets. Even the pigeons know me; the moment I come out with a bag
of feed, they begin to fly toward me from blocks away. It is an area
that stretches from Ninety-sixth Street to Seventy-second Street and
from Central Park to Riverside Drive. Almost every day on my walk after
lunch, I pass the funeral parlor that waits for us and all our ambitions
and illusions. Sometimes I imagine that the funeral parlor is also a
kind of cafeteria where one gets a quick eulogy or Kaddish on the way to
eternity.</p>
<p>The cafeteria people I meet are mostly men: old bachelors like
myself, would-be writers, retired teachers, some with dubious doctorate
titles, a rabbi without a congregation, a painter of Jewish themes, a
few translators—all immigrants from Poland or Russia. I seldom know
their names. One of them disappears and I think he is already in the
next world; suddenly he reappears and he tells me that he has tried to
settle in Tel Aviv or Los Angeles. Again he eats his rice pudding,
sweetens his coffee with saccharin. He has a few more wrinkles, but he
tells the same stories and makes the same gestures. It may happen that
he takes a paper from his pocket and reads me a poem he has written.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>It was in the fifties that a woman appeared in the group who looked
younger than the rest of us. She must have been in her early thirties;
she was short, slim, with a girlish face, brown hair that she wore in a
bun, a short nose, and dimples in her cheeks. Her eyes were
hazel—actually, of an indefinite color. She dressed in a modest European
way. She spoke Polish, Russian, and an idiomatic Yiddish. She always
carried Yiddish newspapers and magazines. She had been in a prison camp
in Russia and had spent some time in the camps in Germany before she
obtained a visa for the United States. The men all hovered around her.
They didn’t let her pay the check. They gallantly brought her coffee and
cheesecake. They listened to her talk and jokes. She had returned from
the devastation still gay. She was introduced to me. Her name was
Esther. I didn’t know if she was unmarried, a widow, a divorcée. She
told me she was working in a factory, where she sorted buttons. This
fresh young woman did not fit into the group of elderly has-beens. It
was also hard to understand why she couldn’t find a better job than
sorting buttons in New Jersey. But I didn’t ask too many questions. She
told me that she had read my writing while still in Poland, and later in
the camps in Germany after the war. She said to me, “You are my
writer.”</p>
<p>The moment she uttered those words I imagined I was in love with her.
We were sitting alone (the other man at our table had gone to make a
telephone call), and I said, “For such words I must kiss you.”</p>
<p>“Well, what are you waiting for?”</p>
<p>She gave me both a kiss and a bite.</p>
<p>I said, “You are a ball of fire.”</p>
<p>“Yes, fire from Gehenna.”</p>
<p>A few days later, she invited me to her home. She lived on a street
between Broadway and Riverside Drive with her father, who had no legs
and sat in a wheelchair. His legs had been frozen in Siberia. He had
tried to run away from one of Stalin’s slave camps in the winter of
1944. He looked like a strong man, had a head of thick white hair, a
ruddy face, and eyes full of energy. He spoke in a swaggering fashion,
with boyish boastfulness and a cheerful laugh. In an hour, he told me
his story. He was born in White Russia but he had lived long years in
Warsaw, Lodz, and Vilna. In the beginning of the thirties, he became a
Communist and soon afterward a functionary in the Party. In 1939 he
escaped to Russia with his daughter. His wife and the other children
remained in Nazi-occupied Warsaw. In Russia, somebody denounced him as a
Trotskyite and he was sent to mine gold in the north. The G.P.U. sent
people there to die. Even the strongest could not survive the cold and
hunger for more than a year. They were exiled without a sentence. They
died together: Zionists, Bundists, members of the Polish Socialist
Party, Ukrainian Nationalists, and just refugees, all caught because of
the labor shortage. They often died of scurvy or beriberi. Boris Merkin,
Esther’s father, spoke about this as if it were a big joke. He called
the Stalinists outcasts, bandits, sycophants. He assured me that had it
not been for the United States Hitler would have overrun all of Russia.
He told how prisoners tricked the guards to get an extra piece of bread
or a double portion of watery soup, and what methods were used in
picking lice.</p>
<p>Esther called out, “Father, enough!”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter—am I lying?”</p>
<p>“One can have enough even of kreplach.”</p>
<p>“Daughter, you did it yourself.”</p>
<p>When Esther went to the kitchen to make tea, I learned from her
father that she had had a husband in Russia—a Polish Jew who had
volunteered in the Red Army and perished in the war. Here in New York
she was courted by a refugee, a former smuggler in Germany who had
opened a bookbinding factory and become rich. “Persuade her to marry
him,” Boris Merkin said to me. “It would be good for me, too.”</p>
<p>“Maybe she doesn’t love him.”</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as love. Give me a cigarette. In the camp,
people climbed on one another like worms.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>I had invited Esther to supper, but she called to say she had the
grippe and must remain in bed. Then in a few days’ time a situation
arose that made me leave for Israel. On the way back, I stopped over in
London and Paris. I wanted to write to Esther, but I had lost her
address. When I returned to New York, I tried to call her, but there was
no telephone listing for Boris Merkin or Esther Merkin—father and
daughter must have been boarders in somebody else’s apartment. Weeks
passed and she did not show up in the cafeteria. I asked the group about
her; nobody knew where she was. “She has most probably married that
bookbinder,” I said to myself. One evening, I went to the cafeteria with
the premonition that I would find Esther there. I saw a black wall and
boarded windows—the cafeteria had burned. The old bachelors were no
doubt meeting in another cafeteria, or an Automat. But where? To search
is not in my nature. I had plenty of complications without Esther.</p>
<p>The summer passed; it was winter. Late one day, I walked by the
cafeteria and again saw lights, a counter, guests. The owners had
rebuilt. I entered, took a check, and saw Esther sitting alone at a
table reading a Yiddish newspaper. She did not notice me, and I observed
her for a while. She wore a man’s fur fez and a jacket trimmed with a
faded fur collar. She looked pale, as though recuperating from a
sickness. Could that grippe have been the start of a serious illness? I
went over to her table and asked, “What’s new in buttons?”</p>
<p>She started and smiled. Then she called out, “Miracles do
happen!”</p>
<p>“Where have you been?”</p>
<p>“Where did you disappear to?” she replied. “I thought you were still
abroad.”</p>
<p>“Where are our cafeterianiks?”</p>
<p>“They now go to the cafeteria on Fifty-seventh Street and Eighth
Avenue. They only reopened this place yesterday.”</p>
<p>“May I bring you a cup of coffee?”</p>
<p>“I drink too much coffee. All right.”</p>
<p>I went to get her coffee and a large egg cookie. While I stood at the
counter, I turned my head and looked at her. Esther had taken off her
mannish fur hat and smoothed her hair. She folded the newspaper, which
meant that she was ready to talk. She got up and tilted the other chair
against the table as a sign that the seat was taken. When I sat down,
Esther said, “You left without saying goodbye, and there I was about to
knock at the pearly gates of Heaven.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“Oh, the grippe became pneumonia. They gave me penicillin, and I am
one of those who cannot take it. I got a rash all over my body. My
father, too, is not well.”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with your father?”</p>
<p>“High blood pressure. He had a kind of stroke and his mouth became
all crooked.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry. Do you still work with buttons?”</p>
<p>“Yes, with buttons. At least I don’t have to use my head, only my
hands. I can think my own thoughts.”</p>
<p>“What do you think about?”</p>
<p>“What not. The other workers are all Puerto Ricans. They rattle away
in Spanish from morning to night.”</p>
<p>“Who takes care of your father?”</p>
<p>“Who? Nobody. I come home in the evening to make supper. He has one
desire—to marry me off for my own good and, perhaps, for his comfort,
but I can’t marry a man I don’t love.”</p>
<p>“What is love?”</p>
<p>“You ask me! You write novels about it. But you’re a man—I assume you
really don’t know what it is. A woman is a piece of merchandise to you.
To me a man who talks nonsense or smiles like an idiot is repulsive. I
would rather die than live with him. And a man who goes from one woman
to another is not for me. I don’t want to share with anybody.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid a time is coming when everybody will.”</p>
<p>“That is not for me.”</p>
<p>“What kind of person was your husband?”</p>
<p>“How did you know I had a husband? My father, I suppose. The minute I
leave the room, he prattles. My husband believed in things and was ready
to die for them. He was not exactly my type but I respected him and
loved him, too. He wanted to die and he died like a hero. What else can
I say?”</p>
<p>“And the others?”</p>
<p>“There were no others. Men were after me. The way people behaved in
the war—you will never know. They lost all shame. On the bunks near me
one time, a mother lay with one man and her daughter with another.
People were like beasts—worse than beasts. In the middle of it all, I
dreamed about love. Now I have even stopped dreaming. The men who come
here are terrible bores. Most of them are half mad, too. One of them
tried to read me a forty-page poem. I almost fainted.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t read you anything I’d written.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been told how you behave—no!”</p>
<p>“No is no. Drink your coffee.”</p>
<p>“You don’t even try to persuade me. Most men around here plague you
and you can’t get rid of them. In Russia people suffered, but I have
never met as many maniacs there as in New York City. The building where
I live is a madhouse. My neighbors are lunatics. They accuse each other
of all kinds of things. They sing, cry, break dishes. One of them jumped
out of the window and killed herself. She was having an affair with a
boy twenty years younger. In Russia the problem was to escape the lice;
here you’re surrounded by insanity.”</p>
<p>We drank coffee and shared the egg cookie. Esther put down her cup.
“I can’t believe that I’m sitting with you at this table. I read all
your articles under all your pen names. You tell so much about yourself
I have the feeling I’ve known you for years. Still, you are a riddle to
me.”</p>
<p>“Men and women can never understand one another.”</p>
<p>“No—I cannot understand my own father. Sometimes he is a complete
stranger to me. He won’t live long.”</p>
<p>“Is he so sick?”</p>
<p>“It’s everything together. He’s lost the will to live. Why live
without legs, without friends, without a family? They have all perished.
He sits and reads the newspapers all day long. He acts as though he were
interested in what’s going on in the world. His ideals are gone, but he
still hopes for a just revolution. How can a revolution help him? I
myself never put my hopes in any movement or party. How can we hope when
everything ends in death?”</p>
<p>“Hope in itself is a proof that there is no death.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know you often write about this. For me, death is the only
comfort. What do the dead do? They continue to drink coffee and eat egg
cookies? They still read newspapers? A life after death would be nothing
but a joke.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Some of the cafeterianiks came back to the rebuilt cafeteria. New
people appeared—all of them Europeans. They launched into long
discussions in Yiddish, Polish, Russian, even Hebrew. Some of those who
came from Hungary mixed German, Hungarian, Yiddish-German—then all of a
sudden they began to speak plain Galician Yiddish. They asked to have
their coffee in glasses, and held lumps of sugar between their teeth
when they drank. Many of them were my readers. They introduced
themselves and reproached me for all kinds of literary errors: I
contradicted myself, went too far in descriptions of sex, described Jews
in such a way that anti-Semites could use it for propaganda. They told
me their experiences in the ghettos, in the Nazi concentration camps, in
Russia. They pointed out one another. “Do you see that fellow—in Russia
he immediately became a Stalinist. He denounced his own friends. Here in
America he has switched to anti-Bolshevism.” The one who was spoken
about seemed to sense that he was being maligned, because the moment my
informant left he took his cup of coffee and his rice pudding, sat down
at my table, and said, “Don’t believe a word of what you are told. They
invent all kinds of lies. What could you do in a country where the rope
was always around your neck? You had to adjust yourself if you wanted to
live and not perish somewhere in Kazakhstan. To get a bowl of soup or a
place to stay you had to sell your soul.”</p>
<p>There was a table with a group of refugees who ignored me. They were
not interested in literature and journalism but strictly in business. In
Germany they had been smugglers. They seemed to be doing some shady
business here, too; they whispered to one another and winked, counted
their money, wrote long lists of numbers. Somebody pointed out one of
them. “He had a store in Auschwitz.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, a store?”</p>
<p>“God help us. He kept his merchandise in the straw where he slept—a
rotten potato, sometimes a piece of soap, a tin spoon, a little fat.
Still, he did business. Later, in Germany, he became such a big smuggler
they once took forty thousand dollars away from him.”</p>
<p>Sometimes months passed between my visits to the cafeteria. A year or
two had gone by (perhaps three or four; I lost count), and Esther did
not show up. I asked about her a few times. Someone said that she was
going to the cafeteria on Forty-second Street; another had heard that
she was married. I learned that some of the cafeterianiks had died. They
were beginning to settle down in the United States, had remarried,
opened businesses, workshops, even had children again. Then came cancer
or a heart attack. The result of the Hitler and Stalin years, it was
said.</p>
<p>One day, I entered the cafeteria and saw Esther. She was sitting
alone at a table. It was the same Esther. She was even wearing the same
fur hat, but a strand of gray hair fell over her forehead. How
strange—the fur hat, too, seemed to have grayed. The other cafeterianiks
did not appear to be interested in her anymore, or they did not know
her. Her face told of the time that had passed. There were shadows under
her eyes. Her gaze was no longer so clear. Around her mouth was an
expression that could be called bitterness, disenchantment. I greeted
her. She smiled, but her smile immediately faded away. I asked, “What
happened to you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m still alive.”</p>
<p>“May I sit down?”</p>
<p>“Please—certainly.”</p>
<p>“May I bring you a cup of coffee?”</p>
<p>“No. Well, if you insist.”</p>
<p>I noticed that she was smoking, and also that she was reading not the
newspaper to which I contribute but a competition paper. She had gone
over to the enemy. I brought her coffee and for myself stewed prunes—a
remedy for constipation. I sat down. “Where were you all this time? I
have asked for you.”</p>
<p>“Really? Thank you.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“Nothing good.” She looked at me. I knew that she saw in me what I
saw in her: the slow wilting of the flesh. She said, “You have no hair
but you are white.”</p>
<p>For a while we were silent. Then I said, “Your father—” and as I said
it I knew that her father was not alive.</p>
<p>Esther said, “He has been dead for almost two years.”</p>
<p>“Do you still sort buttons?”</p>
<p>“No, I became an operator in a dress shop.”</p>
<p>“What happened to you personally, may I ask?”</p>
<p>“Oh nothing—absolutely nothing. You will not believe it, but I was
sitting here thinking about you. I have fallen into some kind of trap. I
don’t know what to call it. I thought perhaps you could advise me. Do
you still have the patience to listen to the troubles of little people
like me? No, I didn’t mean to insult you. I even doubted you would
remember me. To make it short, I work but work is growing more difficult
for me. I suffer from arthritis. I feel as if my bones would crack. I
wake up in the morning and can’t sit up. One doctor tells me that it’s a
disc in my back, others try to cure my nerves. One took X-rays and says
that I have a tumor. He wanted me to go to the hospital for a few weeks,
but I’m in no hurry for an operation. Suddenly a little lawyer showed
up. He is a refugee himself and is connected with the German government.
You know they’re now giving reparation money. It’s true that I escaped
to Russia, but I’m a victim of the Nazis just the same. Besides, they
don’t know my biography so exactly. I could get a pension plus a few
thousand dollars, but my dislocated disc is no good for the purpose
because I got it later—after the camps. This lawyer says my only chance
is to convince them that I am ruined psychically. It’s the bitter truth,
but how can you prove it? The German doctors, the neurologists, the
psychiatrists require proof. Everything has to be according to the
textbooks—just so and no different. The lawyer wants me to play insane.
Naturally, he gets twenty per cent of the reparation money—maybe more.
Why he needs so much money I don’t understand. He’s already in his
seventies, an old bachelor. He tried to make love to me and whatnot.
He’s half meshuga himself. But how can I play insane when actually I am
insane? The whole thing revolts me and I’m afraid it will really drive
me crazy. I hate swindle. But this shyster pursues me. I don’t sleep.
When the alarm rings in the morning, I wake up as shattered as I used to
be in Russia when I had to walk to the forest and saw logs at four in
the morning. Naturally, I take sleeping pills—if I didn’t, I couldn’t
sleep at all. That is more or less the situation.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you get married? You are still a good-looking woman.”</p>
<p>“Well, the old question—there is nobody. It’s too late. If you knew
how I felt, you wouldn’t ask such a question.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>A few weeks passed. Snow had been falling. After the snow came rain,
then frost. I stood at my window and looked out at Broadway. The
passersby half walked, half slipped. Cars moved slowly. The sky above
the roofs shone violet, without a moon, without stars, and even though
it was eight o’clock in the evening the light and the emptiness reminded
me of dawn. The stores were deserted. For a moment, I had the feeling I
was in Warsaw. The telephone rang and I rushed to answer it as I did
ten, twenty, thirty years ago—still expecting the good tidings that a
telephone call was about to bring me. I said hello, but there was no
answer and I was seized by the fear that some evil power was trying to
keep back the good news at the last minute. Then I heard a stammering. A
woman’s voice muttered my name.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is I.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me for disturbing you. My name is Esther. We met a few weeks
ago in the cafeteria—”</p>
<p>“Esther!” I exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how I got the courage to phone you. I need to talk to
you about something. Naturally, if you have the time and—please forgive
my presumption.”</p>
<p>“No presumption. Would you like to come to my apartment?”</p>
<p>“If I will not be interrupting. It’s difficult to talk in the
cafeteria. It’s noisy and there are eavesdroppers. What I want to tell
you is a secret I wouldn’t trust to anyone else.”</p>
<p>“Please, come up.”</p>
<p>I gave Esther directions. Then I tried to make order in my apartment,
but I soon realized this was impossible. Letters, manuscripts lay around
on tables and chairs. In the corners books and magazines were piled
high. I opened the closets and threw inside whatever was under my hand:
jackets, pants, shirts, shoes, slippers. I picked up an envelope and saw
to my amazement that it had never been opened. I tore it open and found
a check. “What’s the matter with me—have I lost my mind?” I said out
loud. I tried to read the letter that came with the check, but I had
misplaced my glasses; my fountain pen was gone, too. Well—and where were
my keys? I heard a bell ring and I didn’t know whether it was the door
or the telephone. I opened the door and saw Esther. It must have been
snowing again, because her hat and the shoulders of her coat were
trimmed with white. I asked her in, and my neighbor, the divorcée, who
spied on me openly with no shame—and, God knows, with no sense of
purpose—opened her door and stared at my new guest.</p>
<p>Esther removed her boots and I took her coat and put it on the case
of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. I shoved a few manuscripts off the sofa
so she could sit down. I said, “In my house there is sheer chaos.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>I sat in an armchair strewn with socks and handkerchiefs. For a while
we spoke about the weather, about the danger of being out in New York at
night—even early in the evening. Then Esther said, “Do you remember the
time I spoke to you about my lawyer—that I had to go to a psychiatrist
because of the reparation money?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I remember.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t tell you everything. It was too wild. It still seems
unbelievable, even to me. Don’t interrupt me, I implore you. I’m not
completely healthy—I may even say that I’m sick—but I know the
difference between fact and illusion. I haven’t slept for nights, and I
kept wondering whether I should call you or not. I decided not to—but
this evening it occurred to me that if I couldn’t trust you with a thing
like this then there is no one I could talk to. I read you and I know
that you have a sense of the great mysteries—” Esther said all this
stammering and with pauses. For a moment her eyes smiled, and then they
became deeply sad and wavering.</p>
<p>I said, “You can tell me everything.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid that you’ll think me insane.”</p>
<p>“I swear I will not.”</p>
<p>Esther bit her lower lip. “I want you to know that I saw Hitler,” she
said.</p>
<p>Even though I was prepared for something unusual, my throat
constricted. “When—where?”</p>
<p>“You see, you are frightened already. It happened three years
ago—almost four. I saw him here on Broadway.”</p>
<p>“On the street?”</p>
<p>“In the cafeteria.”</p>
<p>I tried to swallow the lump in my throat. “Most probably someone
resembling him,” I said finally.</p>
<p>“I knew you would say that. But remember, you’ve promised to listen.
You recall the fire in the cafeteria?”</p>
<p>“Yes, certainly.”</p>
<p>“The fire has to do with it. Since you don’t believe me anyhow, why
draw it out? It happened this way. That night I didn’t sleep. Usually
when I can’t sleep, I get up and make tea, or I try to read a book, but
this time some power commanded me to get dressed and go out. I can’t
explain to you how I dared walk on Broadway at that late hour. It must
have been two or three o’clock. I reached the cafeteria, thinking
perhaps it stays open all night. I tried to look in, but the large
window was covered by a curtain. There was a pale glow inside. I tried
the revolving door and it turned. I went in and saw a scene I will not
forget to the last day of my life. The tables were shoved together and
around them sat men in white robes, like doctors or orderlies, all with
swastikas on their sleeves. At the head sat Hitler. I beg you to hear me
out—even a deranged person sometimes deserves to be listened to. They
all spoke German. They didn’t see me. They were busy with the Führer. It
grew quiet and he started to talk. That abominable voice—I heard it many
times on the radio. I didn’t make out exactly what he said. I was too
terrified to take it in. Suddenly one of his henchmen looked back at me
and jumped up from his chair. How I came out alive I will never know. I
ran with all my strength, and I was trembling all over. When I got home,
I said to myself, ‘Esther, you are not right in the head.’ I still don’t
know how I lived through that night. The next morning, I didn’t go
straight to work but walked to the cafeteria to see if it was really
there. Such an experience makes a person doubt his own senses. When I
arrived, I found the place had burned down. When I saw this, I knew it
had to do with what I had seen. Those who were there wanted all traces
erased. These are the plain facts. I have no reason to fabricate such
queer things.”</p>
<p>We were both silent. Then I said, “You had a vision.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, a vision?”</p>
<p>“The past is not lost. An image from years ago remained present
somewhere in the fourth dimension and it reached you just at that
moment.”</p>
<p>“As far as I know, Hitler never wore a long white robe.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he did.”</p>
<p>“Why did the cafeteria burn down just that night?” Esther asked.</p>
<p>“It could be that the fire evoked the vision.”</p>
<p>“There was no fire then. Somehow I foresaw that you would give me
this kind of explanation. If this was a vision, my sitting here with you
is also a vision.”</p>
<p>“It couldn’t have been anything else. Even if Hitler is living and is
hiding out in the United States, he is not likely to meet his cronies at
a cafeteria on Broadway. Besides, the cafeteria belongs to a Jew.”</p>
<p>“I saw him as I am seeing you now.”</p>
<p>“You had a glimpse back in time.”</p>
<p>“Well, let it be so. But since then I have had no rest. I keep
thinking about it. If I am destined to lose my mind, this will drive me
to it.”</p>
<p>The telephone rang and I jumped up with a start. It was a wrong
number. I sat down again. “What about the psychiatrist your lawyer sent
you to? Tell it to him and you’ll get full compensation.”</p>
<p>Esther looked at me sidewise and unfriendly. “I know what you mean. I
haven’t fallen that low yet.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>I was afraid that Esther would continue to call me. I even planned to
change my telephone number. But weeks and months passed and I never
heard from her or saw her. I didn’t go to the cafeteria. But I often
thought about her. How can the brain produce such nightmares? What goes
on in that little marrow behind the skull? And what guarantee do I have
that the same sort of thing will not happen to me? And how do we know
that the human species will not end like this? I have played with the
idea that all of humanity suffers from schizophrenia. Along with the
atom, the personality of Homo sapiens has been splitting. When it comes
to technology, the brain still functions, but in everything else
degeneration has begun. They are all insane: the Communists, the
Fascists, the preachers of democracy, the writers, the painters, the
clergy, the atheists. Soon technology, too, will disintegrate. Buildings
will collapse, power plants will stop generating electricity. Generals
will drop atomic bombs on their own populations. Mad revolutionaries
will run in the streets, crying fantastic slogans. I have often thought
that it would begin in New York. This metropolis has all the symptoms of
a mind gone berserk.</p>
<p>But since insanity has not yet taken over altogether, one has to act
as though there were still order—according to Vaihinger’s principle of
“as if.” I continued with my scribbling. I delivered manuscripts to the
publisher. I lectured. Four times a year, I sent checks to the federal
government, the state. What was left after my expenses I put in the
savings bank. A teller entered some numbers in my bankbook and this
meant that I was provided for. Somebody printed a few lines in a
magazine or newspaper, and this signified that my value as a writer had
gone up. I saw with amazement that all my efforts turned into paper. My
apartment was one big wastepaper basket. From day to day, all this paper
was getting drier and more parched. I woke up at night fearful that it
would ignite. There was not an hour when I did not hear the sirens of
fire engines.</p>
<p>A year after I had last seen Esther, I was going to Toronto to read a
paper about Yiddish in the second half of the nineteenth century. I put
a few shirts in my valise as well as papers of all kinds, among them one
that made me a citizen of the United States. I had enough paper money in
my pocket to pay for a taxi to Grand Central. But the taxis seemed to be
taken. Those that were not refused to stop. Didn’t the drivers see me?
Had I suddenly become one of those who see and are not seen? I decided
to take the subway. On my way, I saw Esther. She was not alone but with
someone I had known years ago, soon after I arrived in the United
States. He was a frequenter of a cafeteria on East Broadway. He used to
sit at a table, express opinions, criticize, grumble. He was a small
man, with sunken cheeks the color of brick, and bulging eyes. He was
angry at the new writers. He belittled the old ones. He rolled his own
cigarettes and dropped ashes into the plates from which we ate. Almost
two decades had passed since I had last seen him. Suddenly he appears
with Esther. He was even holding her arm. I had never seen Esther look
so well. She was wearing a new coat, a new hat. She smiled at me and
nodded. I wanted to stop her, but my watch showed that it was late. I
barely managed to catch the train. In my bedroom, the bed was already
made. I undressed and went to sleep.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, I awoke. My car was being switched, and I
almost fell out of bed. I could not sleep anymore and I tried to
remember the name of the little man I had seen with Esther. But I was
unable to. The thing I did remember was that even thirty years ago he
had been far from young. He had come to the United States in 1905 after
the revolution in Russia. In Europe, he had a reputation as a speaker
and public figure. How old must he be now? According to my calculations,
he had to be in the late eighties—perhaps even ninety. Is it possible
that Esther could be intimate with such an old man? But this evening he
had not looked old. The longer I brooded about it in the darkness the
stranger the encounter seemed to me. I even imagined that I had read
somewhere in a newspaper that he had died. Do corpses walk around on
Broadway? This would mean that Esther, too, was not living. I raised the
window shade and sat up and looked out into the night—black,
impenetrable, without a moon. A few stars ran along with the train for a
while and then they disappeared. A lighted factory emerged; I saw
machines but no operators. Then it was swallowed in the darkness and
another group of stars began to follow the train. I felt confused and
shaken. I was turning with the earth on its axis. I was circling with it
around the sun and moving in the direction of a constellation whose name
I had forgotten. Is there no death? Or is there no life?</p>
<p>I thought about what Esther had told me of seeing Hitler in the
cafeteria. It had seemed utter nonsense, but now I began to reappraise
the idea. If time and space are nothing more than forms of perception,
as Kant argues, and quality, quantity, causality are only categories of
thinking, why shouldn’t Hitler confer with his Nazis in a cafeteria on
Broadway? Esther didn’t sound insane. She had seen a piece of reality
that the heavenly censorship prohibits as a rule. She had caught a
glimpse behind the curtain of the phenomena. I regretted that I had not
asked for more details.</p>
<p>In Toronto, I had little time to ponder these matters, but when I
returned to New York I went to the cafeteria for some private
investigation. I met only one man I knew: a rabbi who had become an
agnostic and given up his job. I asked him about Esther. He said, “The
pretty little woman who used to come here?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I heard that she committed suicide.”</p>
<p>“When—how?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Perhaps we are not speaking about the same
person.”</p>
<p>No matter how many questions I asked and how much I described Esther,
everything remained vague. Some young woman who used to come here had
turned on the gas and made an end of herself—that was all the ex-rabbi
could tell me.</p>
<p>I decided not to rest until I knew for certain what had happened to
Esther and also to that half writer, half politician I remembered from
East Broadway. But I grew busier from day to day. The cafeteria closed.
The neighborhood changed. Years have passed and I have never seen Esther
again. Yes, corpses do walk on Broadway. But why did Esther choose that
particular corpse? She could have got a better bargain even in this
world.</p>
