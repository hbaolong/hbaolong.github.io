<h4 id="a-summers-reading">A Summer’s Reading</h4>
<p>By Bernard Malamud (1956)</p>
<p>George Stoyonovich was a neighborhood boy who had quit high school on
an impulse when he was sixteen, and though he was ashamed whenever he
went looking for a job and people asked him if he had finished school,
he never went back. This particular summer was a hard time for jobs, and
he had none. Having so much time on his hands, George thought of going
to summer school, but he decided the kids in his classes would be too
young. He also considered registering in a night high school, but he
didn’t like the idea of the teachers telling him what to do. He felt
they had never respected him. The result was he stayed in his room most
of the day. He was close to twenty and had needs with the neighborhood
girls, but no money of his own to spend, and he couldn’t get much,
either, because his father was poor, and his sister Sophie—a tall, bony
girl of twenty-three, who resembled George—earned very little, and what
she had she kept for herself. Their mother was dead, and Sophie had to
take care of the house and work at her job as well.</p>
<p>George’s father got up very early in the morning to go to work in a
fish market. Sophie left at about eight for a long ride in the subway.
She worked in a cafeteria in the Bronx. George had his coffee by
himself, then hung around in the house. When the house, a five-room
railroad flat above a butcher store on the lower East Side, got on his
nerves, he cleaned it up—mopped the floors with a wet mop and put things
away. But most of the time he sat in his room. In the afternoons, he
usually listened to the ball games. Otherwise, he had a couple of old
copies of the World Almanac, which he had bought long ago, and he liked
to read in them, and also to read the magazines and newspapers Sophie
brought home, which had been left on the tables in the cafeteria. The
magazines were mostly picture magazines about movie stars and sports
figures, and the papers were generally the News and Mirror. Sophie
herself read whatever fell into her hands, although she sometimes read
good books.</p>
<p>She once asked George what he did in his room all day, and he
answered that he read a lot, too.</p>
<p>“What besides what I bring home?” she asked. “Do you ever read any
worth-while books?”</p>
<p>“Some,” George answered, although he really didn’t. He had tried to
read a book or two that Sophie had in the house, but he’d found he was
in no mood for them. Lately he couldn’t stand made-up stories; they got
on his nerves.</p>
<p>He wished he had some hobby to work at; as a kid he had been good in
carpentry, but where could he work at it? Sometimes he went for walks
during the day, but mostly he did his walking after the sun had gone
down, when it was cooler in the streets.</p>
<p>In the evenings, after supper, George left the house and wandered in
the neighborhood. During the sultry spells, some of the storekeepers and
their wives sat in chairs on the thick, cracked sidewalks in front of
their shops, fanning themselves, and George walked past them, and past
the guys hanging out on the candy-store corner. A couple of the guys he
had known his whole life, but he and they never recognized each other.
He had no place special to go, but usually—saving it for the last—he
left the neighborhood and walked till he came to a darkly lit little
park with benches and trees and a low iron railing, giving it a feeling
of privacy. He stepped over the railing and sat on a bench, looking at
the leafy trees and the flowers blooming inside the railing, and
thinking of a better life for himself. He thought of the jobs he had had
since he quit school—delivery boy, stock clerk, runner, odd jobs in a
factory—and he was dissatisfied with all of them. He felt he would
someday like to have a good job and live in a private house with a
porch, on a street with trees. He wanted to have dough in his pocket to
buy things with, and a girl, so as not to be so lonely, especially on
Saturday nights. He wanted people to like and respect him. He thought
about these things often, and mostly when he was alone at night. Around
midnight, he would get up and drift back to his hot and stony
neighborhood.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>One time, on his walk, George met Mr. Cattanzara coming home very
late from work. He wondered if Mr. Cattanzara was drunk, and then saw
that he wasn’t. Mr. Cattanzara, a stocky, bald-headed man who worked in
the change booth of an I.R.T. station, lived on the block next to
George’s, above a shoe-repair store. Nights, during the hot weather, he
sat on his stoop in an undershirt, reading the Times in the light from
the shoemaker’s window. He read it from the first page to the last, then
went up to his flat to sleep. And all evening, while he was reading the
paper, his wife, a fat woman with a white face, leaned out of the window
above, looking into the street, her thick arms folded under her loose
breasts, on the window ledge.</p>
<p>Once in a while, Mr. Cattanzara came home drunk, but it was always a
quiet drunk. He never made any trouble; he just walked stiffly up the
street and slowly climbed the stoop and went into his doorway. He looked
the same as always, except for the stiff walk and the fact that his eyes
were sad. George liked him, because he remembered Mr. Cattanzara giving
him nickels to buy lemon ice with when he was a squirt. Mr. Cattanzara
was different from most of the people in the neighborhood. He asked
different questions when he met you, and he seemed to know what went on
in all the newspapers.</p>
<p>“What are you doing with yourself this summer, George?”
Mr. Cattanzara asked that evening when they met. “I see you walkin’
around at nights.”</p>
<p>George felt embarrassed. “I like to walk,” he said.</p>
<p>“What are you doin’ in the day now?”</p>
<p>“Nothing much just right now. I’m waiting for a job.” Then, since it
shamed him to admit he wasn’t working, George said, “I’m staying home,
but I’m reading a lot to pick up my education.”</p>
<p>Mr. Cattanzara looked interested. He mopped his hot face with a red
handkerchief.</p>
<p>“What are you readin’?”</p>
<p>George hesitated, then said, “I got a list of books in the library,
once, and now I decided to read them this summer.” He felt strange and a
little unhappy saying this, but he wanted Mr. Cattanzara to respect
him.</p>
<p>“How many books are on it?” Mr. Cattanzara asked.</p>
<p>“I never counted them. Maybe around a hundred.”</p>
<p>Mr. Cattanzara whistled.</p>
<p>“I figured if I did that, it would help me in my education,” George
went on earnestly. “I don’t mean the kind they give you in high school.
I want to know different things than you learn there, if you know what I
mean.”</p>
<p>Mr. Cattanzara nodded. “Still and all, one hundred books is a big
load, just for one summer,” he said.</p>
<p>“It might take longer.”</p>
<p>“After you’ve finished with some, maybe you and I can have a nice
talk about them,” said Mr. Cattanzara.</p>
<p>“When I’m finished,” George answered.</p>
<p>Mr. Cattanzara went home and George continued on his walk. After that
night, George still did nothing different from the usual, though he had
the urge to. He just took his walks at night, ending up in the little
park. But one evening the shoemaker from the next block stopped George
and said he was a good boy, and George figured that Mr. Cattanzara had
told him about all the books he was supposed to be reading. From the
shoemaker, the report must have gone on down the street, because in the
next few days George saw a couple of people smiling kindly at him,
though nobody spoke to him personally. He felt a little better around
the neighborhood, and liked it more, though not so much that he would
want to live in it forever. He had never exactly disliked the people in
it, yet he had never liked them very much, either.</p>
<p>Soon, to his surprise, George found that his father and Sophie had
learned about his reading, too. His father was too shy to say anything
about it—he had never been much of a talker in his whole life—but Sophie
was softer to George now, and she showed him in other ways that she was
proud of him.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>As the summer went on, George felt in a good mood about things. He
cleaned the house every day, as a favor to Sophie, and he enjoyed the
ball games more. Sophie gave him a dollar a week allowance, and though
it still wasn’t enough and he had to use it carefully, it was a lot
better than the occasional two bits he’d had before. He got a big kick
out of what he bought with the money—cigarettes mostly, an occasional
beer, or a movie ticket. Life wasn’t so bad if you knew how to
appreciate it. Once in a while, he bought a paperback book from a
newsstand, but he never got around to reading it, though he was glad to
have it and a couple of others in his room. He still read Sophie’s
magazines and newspapers thoroughly.</p>
<p>Night was the most enjoyable time now, because when he passed the
storekeepers sitting out on the sidewalk, he could tell how highly they
and their wives regarded him. He walked erect, and though he did not say
much to them, or they to him, he could feel approval on all sides. A
couple of nights, he felt so good that he skipped the park at the end of
the walk. He just wandered in the neighborhood, where people had known
him from the time he was a kid playing punchball; he wandered there,
then came home and got undressed for bed, feeling fine.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, after that one encounter, George talked only
once with Mr. Cattanzara. The change-maker said nothing more about the
books, and asked no questions, but the fact that he didn’t made George a
little uneasy. For a while, George didn’t pass in front of
Mr. Cattanzara’s house any more. Then, one night, forgetting himself, he
approached it. The time was already past midnight. The street, except
for one or two people, was deserted, and George was surprised when he
saw Mr. Cattanzara still reading his newspaper. George’s impulse was to
go up and talk to him; he wasn’t sure what he wanted to say, but he felt
the words would come when he began to talk. Yet the more he thought
about it, the more the idea scared him, and he decided he’d better not.
He even considered turning around and running home another way, but he
was already too near Mr. Cattanzara, and the change-maker might see him
and get annoyed. So George unobtrusively crossed the street, trying to
make it seem that he had to look in a store window on the other side,
and then went on, uncomfortable at what he was doing. He feared
Mr. Cattanzara would glance up from his paper and call him a dirty rat
for walking on the other side of the street, but all the change-maker
did was sit there in his undershirt, his bald head shining in the dim
light, while he read his Times and upstairs his fat wife leaned out of
the window, seeming to read the paper along with him. George thought she
would spy him and yell out to Mr. Cattanzara, but she never moved her
eyes from her husband.</p>
<p>George made up his mind to stay away from Mr. Cattanzara until he had
got some of his paperback books read, but when he started to read them
and found that they were all storybooks, he lost interest in them. He
lost interest in reading other things, too. Sophie’s magazines and
newspapers went unread. She saw them piled up on a chair in his room and
asked why he was no longer looking at them, and George told her it was
because of all the other reading he had to do. Sophie said she had
guessed that was it. So for most of the day George had the radio on,
turning to music when he was sick of the human voice. He kept the house
fairly neat, and Sophie said nothing on the days when he neglected it.
She was still kind and gave him his dollar, but now things were not so
good for him as they had been for a while.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>But things were good enough, considering. Also, George’s night walks
invariably picked him up, no matter how bad the day had been. Then, one
night, George saw Mr. Cattanzara coming down the street toward him.
George was about to turn and run, but he recognized from
Mr. Cattanzara’s walk that he was drunk, and thought that he would
probably not even notice him. So George kept on walking until he and
Mr. Cattanzara passed each other, and though George felt wound up enough
to pop into the sky, he was not surprised when Mr. Cattanzara went on by
without a word, walking slowly, his face and body stiff. George drew a
breath in relief at his escape, and then he heard his name called, and
he stopped, and there stood Mr. Cattanzara at his elbow, smelling like a
bar. His eyes were sad, and George felt so intensely uncomfortable that
he was tempted to shove him aside and continue on his walk. But he
couldn’t act that way, and besides Mr. Cattanzara took a nickel out of
his pants pocket and handed it to him. “Go buy yourself a lemon ice,
Georgie,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s not that time any more, Mr. Cattanzara,” George said. “I’m a
big guy now.”</p>
<p>“No, you ain’t,” said Mr. Cattanzara, and to this George made no
reply. “How are all your books comin’ along now?” Mr. Cattanzara asked.
Though he tried to stand steady, he swayed a little.</p>
<p>“Fine, I guess,” said George, feeling redness crawl up his face.</p>
<p>“You ain’t sure?” The change-maker smiled slyly, in a way George had
never seen him smile when he was sober.</p>
<p>“Sure I’m sure,” George said. “They’re fine.”</p>
<p>Mr. Cattanzara’s head swayed in little arcs, but his eyes were
steady. He had small blue eyes that hurt if you looked at them too
long.</p>
<p>“George,” he said, “name me one book on that list that you read this
summer, and I will drink to your health.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want anyone drinking to me,” George said.</p>
<p>“Name me one, so I can ask you a question on it. Who can tell—if it’s
a good book, maybe I might wanna read it myself?”</p>
<p>George knew he looked the same as ever on the outside, but inside he
was crumbling. Unable to reply, he shut his eyes. When—years later—he
opened them, he saw that Mr. Cattanzara had, out of pity, gone away, but
still in George’s ears were the words he had said as he left: “George,
don’t do what I did.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The next night, George was afraid to leave his room, and though
Sophie argued with him, he wouldn’t open his door.</p>
<p>“What are you doing in there?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you reading?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>She was silent a minute, then asked, “Where do you keep the books you
read? I never see any in your room, outside a few cheap trashy
ones.”</p>
<p>He wouldn’t tell her.</p>
<p>“In that case, you’re not worth a buck of my hard-earned money,” she
said. “Why should I break my poor back for you? Go out, you bum, and get
a job.”</p>
<p>He stayed in his room for almost a week, except to eat. Sophie railed
at him, then begged him to come out, and his old father wept, but George
wouldn’t budge, though the weather was terrible and his small room
stifling. He found it very hard to breathe. One night, unable to stand
the heat any more, he burst into the street at 1 a.m. He hoped to sneak
to the park without being seen, but there were people all over the
block, wilted and listless, waiting for a breeze. George lowered his
eyes and walked, in disgrace, past them, but before long he discovered
they were still friendly to him. He figured Mr. Cattanzara hadn’t told.
Maybe, when he woke up out of his drunk the next morning, he had
forgotten all about their meeting. George felt his confidence come
back.</p>
<p>A little later, a man on a street corner asked him if it was true
that he had finished reading so many books, and George admitted that he
had. The man said it was a wonderful thing for a boy his age to read so
much.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” George said.</p>
<p>He felt relieved, but he hurried away. He hoped nobody would mention
the books anymore, and when, a couple of nights later, he accidentally
met Mr. Cattanzara again, he didn’t.</p>
<p>One evening early in the fall, George ran out of the house and all
the way to the library, where he hadn’t been in years. There were books
all over, wherever he looked, and though he was struggling to control an
invisible trembling, as well as an impulse to run home, he stayed and
counted off a hundred.</p>
