<h4 id="gallatin-canyon">Gallatin Canyon</h4>
<p>By Thomas McGuane (2003)</p>
<p>The day we planned the trip, I told Louise that I didn’t like going
to Idaho via the Gallatin Canyon. It’s too narrow, and while trucks
don’t belong on this road, there they are, lots of them. Tourist
pulloffs and wild animals on the highway complete the picture. We could
have gone by way of Ennis, but Louise had learned that there were road
repairs on Montana Highway 84—twelve miles of torn-up asphalt—in
addition to its being rodeo weekend, and “Do we have to go to Idaho?”
she asked.</p>
<p>I said that I thought it was obvious. A lot rode on the success of
our little jaunt, which was ostensibly to close the sale of a small car
dealership I owned in the sleepy town of Rigby. But, since accepting the
offer of a local buyer, I had received a far better one from elsewhere,
which, my attorney said, I couldn’t take unless my original buyer backed
out—and he would only back out if he got sufficiently angry at me. Said
my attorney: Make him mad. So I was headed to Rigby, Idaho, expressly to
piss off a small-town businessman, who was trying to give me American
money for a going concern on the strip east of town, and thereby make
room for a rich Atlanta investor, new to our landscapes, who needed this
dealership as a kind of flagship for his other intentions. The question
was how to provoke Rigby without arousing his suspicions, and I might
have collected my thoughts a little better had I not had to battle
trucks and tourists in the Gallatin Canyon.</p>
<p>Louise and I had spent a lot of time together in recent years, and we
were both probably wondering where things would go from here. She had
been married, briefly, long ago, and that fact, together with the
relatively peaceful intervening years, gave a pleasant detachment to
most of her relationships, including the one she had with me. In the
past, that would have suited me perfectly; but it did not seem to suit
me now, and I was so powerfully attached to her it made me uncomfortable
that she wasn’t interested in discussing our mutual future, though at
least she had never suggested that we wouldn’t have one. With her thick
blond hair pulled back in a barrette, her strong, shapely figure, and
the direct fullness of her mouth, she was often noticed by other men.
After ten years in Montana, she still had a strong Massachusetts accent.
Louise was a lawyer, specializing in the adjudication of water rights
between agricultural and municipal interests. In our rapidly changing
world, she was much in demand. Though I wished we could spend more time
together, Louise had taught me not to challenge her on this.</p>
<p>No longer the country crossroads of recent memory, Four Corners was
filled with dentists’ offices, fast-food and espresso shops, large and
somehow foreboding filling stations that looked, at night, like colonies
in space; nevertheless, the intersection was true to its name, sending
you north to a transcontinental interstate, east into town, west to the
ranches of Madison County, and south, my reluctant choice, up the
Gallatin Canyon to Yellowstone and the towns of southeast Idaho, one of
which contained property with my name on the deed.</p>
<p>We joined the stream of traffic heading south, the Gallatin River
alongside and usually much below the roadway, a dashing high-gradient
river with anglers in reflective stillness at the edges of its pools,
and bright rafts full of delighted tourists in flotation jackets and
crash helmets sweeping through its white water. Gradually, the mountains
pressed in on all this humanity, and I found myself behind a long line
of cars trailing a cattle truck at well below the speed limit. This
combination of cumbersome commercial traffic and impatient private cars
was a lethal mixture that kept our canyon in the papers, as it regularly
spat out corpses. In my rearview mirror, I could see a line behind me
that was just as long as the one ahead, stretching back, thinning, and
vanishing around a green bend. There was no passing lane for several
miles. A single amorous elk could have turned us all into twisted,
smoking metal.</p>
<p>“You might have been right,” Louise said. “It doesn’t look good.”</p>
<p>She almost certainly had better things to do. But, looking down the
line of cars, I felt my blood pressure rising. Her hands rested quietly
in her lap. I couldn’t possibly have rivalled such serenity.</p>
<p>“How do you plan to anger this guy in Rigby?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I’m going to try haughtiness. If I suggest that he bought the
dealership cheap, he might tell me to keep the damn thing. The Atlanta
guy just wants to start somewhere. All these people have a sort of
parlay mentality and they need to get on the playing field before they
can start running it up. I’m a trader. It all happens for me in the
transition. The moment of liquidation is the essence of capitalism.”</p>
<p>“What about the man in Rigby?”</p>
<p>“He’s an end user. He wants to keep it.”</p>
<p>I reflected on the pathos of ownership and the way it could bog you
down.</p>
<p>“You should be in my world,” Louise said. “According to the law,
water has no reality except its use. In Montana, water isn’t even wet.
Every time some misguided soul suggests that fish need it, it ends up in
the state supreme court.”</p>
<p>Birds were fleeing the advance of automobiles. I was elsewhere,
trying to imagine my buyer, red-faced, storming out of the closing. I’d
offer to let bygones be bygones, I’d take him to dinner, I’d throw a
steak into him, for Christ’s sake. In the end, he’d be glad he wasn’t
stuck with the lot.</p>
<p>Traffic headed toward us, far down the road. We were all packed
together to make sure no one tried to pass. The rules had to be
enforced. Occasionally, someone drifted out for a better look, but not
far enough that someone else could close his space and possibly seal his
fate.</p>
<p>This trip had its risks. I had only recently admitted to myself that
I would like to make more of my situation with Louise than currently
existed. Though ours was hardly a chaste relationship, real intimacy was
relatively scarce. People in relationships nowadays seemed to retain
their secrets like bank deposits—they always set some aside, in case
they might need them to spend on someone new. I found it unpleasant to
think that Louise could be withholding anything.</p>
<p>But I thought I was more presentable than I had been. When Louise and
I first met, I was just coming off two and a half years of peddling
satellite dishes in towns where a couple of dogs doing the wild thing in
the middle of the road amounted to the high point of a year, and the
highest-grossing business was a methamphetamine tent camp out in the
sagebrush. Now I had caught the upswing in our local economy—cars,
storage, tool rental, and mortgage-discounting. I had a pretty home,
debt-free, out on Sourdough. I owned a few things. I could be O.K. I
asked Louise what she thought of the new prosperity around us. She said,
wearily, “I’m not sure it’s such a good thing, living in a boomtown.
It’s basically a high-end carny atmosphere.”</p>
<p>We were just passing Storm Castle and Garnet Mountain. When I glanced
in the mirror, I saw a low red car with a scoop in its hood pull out to
pass. I must have reacted somehow, because Louise asked me if I would
like her to drive.</p>
<p>“No, that’s fine. Things are getting a bit lively back there.”</p>
<p>“Drive defensively.”</p>
<p>“Not much choice, is there?”</p>
<p>I had been mentally rehearsing the closing in Rigby, and I wasn’t
getting anywhere. I had this sort of absurd picture of myself strutting
into the meeting. I tried again to picture the buyer looking seriously
annoyed, but I’d met him before and he seemed pretty levelheaded. I
suspected I’d have to be really outlandish to get a rise out of him. He
was a fourth-generation resident of Rigby, so I could always urge him to
get to know his neighbors, I decided. Or, since he had come up through
the service department, I could try emphasizing the need to study how
the cars actually ran. I’d use hand signals to fend off objections. I
felt more secure.</p>
<p>Some elk had wandered into the parking lot at Buck’s T4 and were
grazing indifferently as people pulled off the highway to admire them. I
don’t know if it was the great unmarred blue sky overhead or the
balsamic zephyr that poured down the mountainside, but I found myself
momentarily buoyed by all this idleness, people out of their cars. I am
always encouraged when I see animals doing something other than running
for their lives. In any case, the stream of traffic ahead of us had been
much reduced by the pedestrian rubbernecking.</p>
<p>“My husband lived here one winter,” Louise said. “He sold his
pharmacy after we divorced, not that he had to, and set out to change
his life. He became a mountain man, wore buckskin clothes. He tried
living off the land one day a week, with the idea that he would build
up. But then he just stuck with one day a week—he’d shoot a rabbit or
something, more of a diet, really. He’s a real-estate agent now, at Big
Sky. I think he’s doing well. At least he’s quit killing rabbits.”</p>
<p>“Remarried?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>As soon as we hit the open country around West Yellowstone, Louise
called her office. When her secretary put her on hold, Louise covered
the mouthpiece and said, “He married a super gal. Minnesota, I think.
She should be good for Bob, and he’s not easy. Bob’s from the South. For
men, it’s a full-time job being Southern. It just wears them out. It
wore me out, too. I developed doubtful behaviors. I pulled out my
eyelashes, and ate twenty-eight hundred dollars’ worth of macadamia
nuts.”</p>
<p>Her secretary came back on the line, and Louise began editing her
schedule with impressive precision, mouthing the word “sorry” to me when
the conversation dragged on. I began musing about my capacity to live
successfully with someone as competent as Louise. There was no implied
hierarchy of status between us, but I wondered if, in the long run,
something would have to give.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>West Yellowstone seemed entirely given over to the well-being of the
snowmobile, and the billboards dedicated to it were anomalous on a sunny
day like today. By winter, schoolchildren would be petitioning futilely
to control the noise at night so that they could do their schoolwork,
and the town would turn a blind eye as a cloud of smoke arose to gas
residents, travellers, and park rangers alike. It seemed incredible to
me that recreation could acquire this level of social momentum, that it
could be seen as an inalienable right.</p>
<p>We came down Targhee Pass and into Idaho, into a wasteland of spindly
pines that had replaced the former forest, and Louise gave voice to the
thoughts she’d been having for the past few miles. “Why don’t you just
let this deal close? You really have no guarantees from the man from
Atlanta. And there’s a good-faith issue here, too, I think.”</p>
<p>“A lawyerly notation.”</p>
<p>“So be it, but it’s true. Are you trying to get every last cent out
of this sale?”</p>
<p>“That’s second. The first priority is to be done with it. It was
meant to be a passive investment, and it has turned out not to be. I get
twenty calls a day from the dealership, most with questions I can’t
answer. It’s turning me into a giant bullshit machine.”</p>
<p>“No investments are really passive.”</p>
<p>“Mutual funds are close.”</p>
<p>“That’s why they don’t pay.”</p>
<p>“Some of them pay, or they would cease to exist.”</p>
<p>“You make a poor libertarian, my darling. You sound like that little
puke David Stockman.”</p>
<p>“Stockman was right about everything. Reagan just didn’t have the
guts to take his advice.”</p>
<p>“Reagan. Give me a break.”</p>
<p>I didn’t mind equal billing in a relationship, but I did dread the
idea of parties speaking strictly from their entitlements across a
chasm. Inevitably, sex would make chaos of much of this, but you
couldn’t, despite Benjamin Franklin’s suggestion, “use venery” as a
management tool.</p>
<p>Louise adjusted her seat back and folded her arms, gazing at the
sunny side of the road. The light through the windshield accentuated the
shape of her face, now in repose. I found her beautiful. I adored her
when she was a noun and was alarmed when she was a verb, which was
usually the case. I understood that this was not the best thing I could
say about myself. When her hand drifted over to my leg, I hardly knew
what to do with this reference to the other life we led. I knew that it
was an excellent thing to be reminded of how inconsequential my worldly
concerns were, but one warm hand, rested casually, and my interest
travelled to the basics of the species.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Ashton, St. Anthony, Sugar City: Mormon hamlets, small farms, and the
furious reordering of watersheds into industrial canals. Irrigation haze
hung over the valley of the Snake, and the skies were less bright than
they had been just a few miles back, in Montana. Many locals had been
killed when the Teton Dam burst, and despite that they wanted to build
it again: the relationship to water here was like a war, and in war
lives are lost. These were the folk to whom I’d sold many a plain car;
ostentation was thoroughly unacceptable hereabouts. The four-door sedan
with a six-cylinder engine was the desired item, an identical one with a
hundred and fifty thousand miles on it generally taken in trade at zero
value, thanks to the manipulation of rebates against the manufacturer’s
suggested retail. Appearances were foremost, and the salesman who could
leave a customer’s smugness undisturbed flourished in this atmosphere. I
had two of them, potato-fattened, bland opportunists with nine kids
between them. They were the asset I was selling; the rest was little
more than bricks and mortar.</p>
<p>We pressed on toward Rexburg, and amid the turnoffs for Wilford,
Newdale, Hibbard, and Moody the only thing that had any flavor was Hog
Hollow Road, which was a shortcut to France—not the one in Europe but
the one just a hop, skip, and a jump south of Squirrel, Idaho. There
were license-plate holders with my name on them in Squirrel, and I was
oddly vain about that.</p>
<p>“Sure seems lonesome around here,” Louise said.</p>
<p>“Oh, boy.”</p>
<p>“The houses are like little forts.”</p>
<p>“The winters are hard.” But it was less that the small neat dwellings
around us appeared defensive than that they seemed to be trying to avoid
attracting the wrath of some inattentive god.</p>
<p>“It looks like government housing for Eskimos. They just sit inside
waiting for a whale, or something.”</p>
<p>This banter had the peculiar effect of making me want to cleave to
Louise, and desperately, too—to build a warm new civilization, possibly
in a foolish house with turrets. The road stretched before me like an
arrow. There was only enough of it left before Rigby for me to say,
perhaps involuntarily, “I wonder if we shouldn’t just get married.”</p>
<p>Louise quickly looked away. Her silence conferred a certain
seriousness on my question.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>But there was Rigby, and, in the parlance of all who have extracted
funds from locals, Rigby had been good to me. Main Street was lined with
ambitious and beautiful stone buildings, old for this part of the world.
Their second and third floors were now affordable housing, and their
street levels were occupied by businesses hanging on by their
fingernails. You could still detect the hopes of the dead, their dreams,
even, though it seemed to be only a matter of time before the wind
carried them away, once and for all.</p>
<p>I drove past the car lot at 200 East Fremont without comment
and—considering the amount of difficulty it had caused me in the years
before I got it stabilized and began to enjoy its very modest
yields—without much feeling. I remembered the day, sometime earlier,
when I had tried to help park the cars in the front row and got
everything so crooked that the salesmen, not concealing their contempt,
had to do it all over again. The title company where we were heading was
on the same street, and it was a livelier place, from the row of perky
evergreens out front to the merry receptionist who greeted us, a
handsome young woman, probably a farm girl only moments before, enjoying
the clothes, makeup, and perquisites of the new world that her firm was
helping to build.</p>
<p>We were shown into a spacious conference room with a long table and
chairs, freshly sharpened pencils, and crisp notepads bearing the
company letterhead. “Shall I stay?” Louise asked, the first thing she’d
said since my earlier inadvertent remark, which I intuited had not been
altogether rejected.</p>
<p>“Please,” I said, gesturing toward a chair next to the one I meant to
take. At that moment, the escrow agent entered and, standing very close
to us, introduced himself as Brent Colby. Then he went to the far end of
the table, where he spread his documents around in an orderly fan. Colby
was around fifty, with iron-gray hair and a deeply lined face. He wore
pressed jeans, a brilliant-white snap-button shirt, cowboy boots, and a
belt buckle with a steer head on it. He had thick, hairy hands and a
gleaming wedding band. Just as he raised his left wrist to check his
watch, the door opened and Oren Johnson, the buyer, entered. He went
straight to Louise and, taking her hand in both of his, introduced
himself. It occurred to me that, in trying to be suave, Oren Johnson had
revealed himself to be a clodhopper, but I was probably just
experiencing the mild hostility that emanates from every sale of
property. Oren wore a suit, though it suggested less a costume for
business than one for church. He had a gold tooth and a cautious
pompadour. He, too, bore an investment-grade wedding band, and I noted
that there was plenty of room in his black-laced shoes for his toes. He
turned and said that it was good to see me again after so long. The time
had come for me to go into my act. With grotesque hauteur, I said that I
didn’t realize we had ever met. This was work.</p>
<p>Oren Johnson bustled with inchoate energy; he was the kind of
small-town leader who sets an example by silently getting things done.
He suggested this just by arranging his pencils and notepad and
repositioning his chair with rough precision. Locking eyes with me, he
stated that he was a man of his word. I didn’t know what he was getting
at, but took it to mean that the formalities of a closing were
superfluous to the old-time handshake with which Oren Johnson
customarily did business. I smiled and quizzically cocked my head as if
to say that the newfangled arrangements with well-attested documents
promptly conveyed to the courthouse suited me just fine, that deals made
on handshakes were strictly for the pious or the picturesque. My message
was clear enough that Louise shifted uncomfortably in her chair, and
Brent Colby knocked his documents edgewise on the desk to align them. As
far as Oren Johnson was concerned, I was beginning to feel that anyone
who strayed from the basic patterns of farm life to sell cars bore
watching. Like a Method actor, I already believed my part.</p>
<p>“You’re an awfully lucky man, Oren Johnson,” I said to him, leaning
back in my chair. I could see Louise openmouthed two seats away from
Brent Colby, and observing myself through her eyes gave me a sudden
burst of panic.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Oren Johnson said. “How’s that?”</p>
<p>“How’s that?” I did a precise job of replicating his inflection. “I
am permitting you to purchase my car lot. You’ve seen the books: how
often does a man get a shot at a business where all the work’s been done
for him?”</p>
<p>Brent Colby was doing an incomplete job of concealing his distaste;
he was enough of a tinhorn to clear his throat theatrically. But Oren
Johnson treated this as a colossal interruption and cast a firm glance
his way.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look all that automatic to me,” he said.</p>
<p>“Aw, hell, you’re just going to coin it. Pull the lever and
relax!”</p>
<p>“What about the illegal oil dump? I wish I had a nickel for every
crankcaseful that went into that hole. Then I wouldn’t worry about
what’s going to happen when the D.E.Q. lowers the boom.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you ought to ride your potato harvester another year or two,
if you’re so risk-averse. Cars are the future. They’re not for
everybody.”</p>
<p>Oren Johnson’s face reddened. He pushed his pencils and notepad
almost out of reach in the middle of the conference table. He
contemplated these supplies a moment before raising his eyes to mine. “I
suppose you could put this car lot where the sun don’t shine, if that
suits you.”</p>
<p>Johnson having taken a stand, I immediately felt unsure that I even
had another buyer. Had I ever acknowledged how much I longed to get rid
of this business and put an end to all those embarrassing phone calls? I
wanted to hand the moment off to someone else while I collected my
thoughts, but as I looked around the room I found no one who was
interested in rescuing me—least of all Louise, who had raised one
eyebrow at the vast peculiarity of my performance. Suddenly, I was
desperate to keep the deal from falling apart. I gave my head a little
twist to free my neck from the constrictions of my collar. I performed
this gesture too vigorously, and I had the feeling that it might seem
like the first movement of some sort of dance filled with sensual
flourishes and bordering on the moronic. I had lost my grip.</p>
<p>“Oren,” I said, and the familiarity seemed inappropriate. “I was
attached to this little enterprise. I wanted to be sure you valued
it.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The deal closed, and I had my check. I tipped back in my chair to
think of a few commemorative words for the new owner, but the two men
left the room without giving me the chance to speak. I shrugged at
Louise, and she, too, rose to go, pausing a moment beneath an enormous
Kodachrome of a bugling elk. I was aware of her distance, and I sensed
that my waffling hadn’t gone over particularly well. I concluded that at
no time in the future would I act out a role to accomplish anything.
This decision quickly evaporated with the realization that that is
practically all we do in life. Comedy failed, too. When I told Louise
that I had been within an inch of opening a can of whup-ass on the
buyer, I barely got a smile. There’s nothing more desolating than having
a phrase like that die on your lips.</p>
<p>It was dark when we got back to Targhee Pass. Leaving town, we passed
the Beehive assisted-living facility and the Riot Zone, a “family fun
park.” Most of the citizens we spotted there seemed unlikely rioters. I
drove past a huge neon steak, its blue T-bone flashing above a
restaurant that was closed and dark. There were deer on the road, and
once, as we passed through a murky section of forest, we saw the pale
faces of children waiting to cross.</p>
<p>“What are they doing out at this hour?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Louise said.</p>
<p>I made good time on the pine flats north of the Snowmobile Capital of
the World, and I wondered what it would be like to live in a town that
was the world capital of a mechanical gadget. In Rigby, we had seen a
homely museum dedicated to Philo T. Farnsworth, the inventor of
television, which featured displays of Farnsworth’s funky assemblages of
tubes and wire and, apparently, coat hangers—stuff his wife was probably
always attempting to throw out, a goal Louise supported. “Too bad Mama
Farnsworth didn’t take all that stuff to the dump,” she said.</p>
<p>We had the highway to ourselves, and clouds of stars seemed to rise
up from the wilderness, lighting the treetops in a cool fire. Slowly,
the canyon closed in around us, and we entered its flowing, dark
space.</p>
<p>The idyll ended just past the ranger station at Black Butte, when a
car pulled in behind us abruptly enough that I checked my speed to see
if I was violating the limit, but I wasn’t. Then the car was very close,
and the driver shifted his lights to a high beam so intense that I could
see our shadows on the dashboard, my knuckles on the steering wheel
glaringly white. I was nearly blinded by my own mirrors, which I hastily
adjusted.</p>
<p>I said, “What’s with this guy?”</p>
<p>“Just let him pass.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that he wants to.”</p>
<p>I softened my pressure on the gas pedal. I thought that by easing my
already moderate speed I would politely suggest that he might go by me.
I even hugged the shoulder, but he remained glued to our bumper. There
was something about this that reminded me strongly of my feeling of
failure back in Rigby, but I was unable to put my finger on it. Maybe it
was the hot light of liquidation, in the glare of which all motives seem
laid bare. I slowed down even more without managing to persuade my
tormentor to pass. “Jesus,” Louise said. “Pull over.” In her accent, it
came out as “pull ovah.”</p>
<p>I moved off to the side of the road slowly and predictably, but
although I had stopped, the incandescent globes persisted in our
rearview mirror. “This is very strange,” Louise said.</p>
<p>“Shall I go back and speak to him?”</p>
<p>After considering for a moment, she said, “No.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because this is not normal.”</p>
<p>I put the car in gear again and pulled back onto the highway. The
last reasonable thought I had was that I would proceed to Bozeman as
though nothing were going on, and once I was back in civilization my
tormentor’s behavior would be visible to all, and I could, if necessary,
simply drive to the police station with him in tow.</p>
<p>Our blinding, syncopated journey continued another mile before we
reached a sweeping eastward bend, closely guarded by the canyon walls. I
knew that just beyond the bend there was a scenic pulloff, and that the
approaching curve was acute enough for a small lead to put me out of
sight. Whether or not this was plausible, I had no idea: I was
exhilarated to be taking a firm hand in my own affairs. And a firm foot!
As we entered the narrows, I pinned the accelerator, and we shot into
the dark. Louise grabbed the front edges of her seat and stared at the
road twisting in front of us. She emitted something like a moan, which I
had heard before in a very different context. Halfway around the curve,
my tormentor vanished behind us, and although my car seemed only
marginally under control, the absence of blinding light was a relief as
we fled into darkness.</p>
<p>When we emerged and the road straightened, I turned off my lights. I
was going so fast I felt light-headed, but the road was visible under
the stars, and I was able to brake hard and drop down into the scenic
turnoff. Seconds later, our new friend shot past, lights blazing into
nowhere. He was clearly determined to catch us: his progress up the
canyon was rapid and increasingly erratic. We watched in fascination
until the lights suddenly jerked sideways, shining in white cones across
the river, turned downward, then disappeared.</p>
<p>I heard Louise say, in a tone of reasonable observation, “He went
in.”</p>
<p>I had an urgent feeling that took a long time to turn into words.
“Did I do that?”</p>
<p>She shook her head, and I pulled out onto the highway, my own
headlights on once more. I drove in an odd, measured way, as if bound
for an undesired destination, pulled along by something outside myself,
thinking: Liquidation. We could see where he’d gone through the
guardrail. We pulled over and got out. Any hope we might have had for
the driver—and we shall be a long time determining if we had any—was
gone the minute we looked down from the riverbank. The car was
submerged, its lights still burning freakishly, illuminating a bulge of
crystalline water, a boulder in the exuberance of a mountain watershed.
Presently, the lights sank into blackness, and only the silver sheen of
river in starlight remained.</p>
<p>Louise cried, “I wish I could feel something!” And when I reached to
comfort her she shoved me away. I had no choice but to climb back up to
the roadway.</p>
<p>After that, I could encounter Louise only by telephone. I told her
that he’d had a record as long as your arm. “It’s not enough!” she said.
I called later to say that he was of German and Italian extraction. That
proved equally unsatisfactory, and when I called to inform her that he
hailed from Wisconsin she just hung up on me, this time for good.</p>
