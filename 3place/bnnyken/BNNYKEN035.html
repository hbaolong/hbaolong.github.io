<h4 id="emergency">Emergency</h4>
<p>By Denis Johnson (1991)</p>
<p>I’d been working in the emergency room for about three weeks, I
guess. This was in 1973, before the summer ended. With nothing to do on
the overnight shift but batch the insurance reports from the daytime
shifts, I just started wandering around, over to the coronary-care unit,
down to the cafeteria, et cetera, looking for Georgie, the orderly, a
pretty good friend of mine. He often stole pills from the cabinets.</p>
<p>He was running over the tiled floor of the operating room with a mop.
“Are you still doing that?” I said.</p>
<p>“Jesus, there’s a lot of blood here,” he complained.</p>
<p>“Where?” The floor looked clean enough to me.</p>
<p>“What the hell were they doing in here?” he asked me.</p>
<p>“They were performing surgery, Georgie,” I told him.</p>
<p>“There’s so much goop inside of us, man,” he said, “and it all wants
to get out.” He leaned his mop against a cabinet.</p>
<p>“What are you crying for?” I didn’t understand.</p>
<p>He stood still, raised both arms slowly behind his head, and
tightened his ponytail. Then he grabbed the mop and started making broad
random arcs with it, trembling and weeping and moving all around the
place really fast. “What am I crying for?” he said. “Jesus. Wow, oh boy,
perfect.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>I was hanging out in the E.R. with fat, quivering Nurse. One of the
Family Service doctors that nobody liked came in looking for Georgie to
wipe up after him. “Where’s Georgie?” this guy asked.</p>
<p>“Georgie’s in O.R.,” Nurse said.</p>
<p>“Again?”</p>
<p>“No,” Nurse said. “Still.”</p>
<p>“Still? Doing what?”</p>
<p>“Cleaning the floor.”</p>
<p>“Again?”</p>
<p>“No,” Nurse said again. “Still.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Back in O.R., Georgie dropped his mop and bent over in the posture of
a child soiling its diapers. He stared down with his mouth open in
terror.</p>
<p>He said, “What am I going to do about these fucking shoes, man?”</p>
<p>“Whatever you stole,” I said, “I guess you already ate it all,
right?”</p>
<p>“Listen to how they squish,” he said, walking around carefully on his
heels.</p>
<p>“Let me check your pockets, man.”</p>
<p>He stood still a minute, and I found his stash. I left him two of
each, whatever they were. “Shift is about half over,” I told him.</p>
<p>“Good. Because I really, really, really need a drink,” he said. “Will
you please help me get this blood mopped up?”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Around 3:30 a.m. a guy with a knife in his eye came in, led by
Georgie.</p>
<p>“I hope you didn’t do that to him,” Nurse said.</p>
<p>“Me?” Georgie said. “No. He was like this.”</p>
<p>“My wife did it,” the man said. The blade was buried to the hilt in
the outside corner of his left eye. It was a hunting knife kind of
thing.</p>
<p>“Who brought you in?” Nurse said.</p>
<p>“Nobody. I just walked down. It’s only three blocks,” the man
said.</p>
<p>Nurse peered at him. “We’d better get you lying down.”</p>
<p>“O.K., I’m certainly ready for something like that,” the man
said.</p>
<p>She peered a bit longer into his face. “Is your other eye,” she said,
“a glass eye?”</p>
<p>“It’s plastic, or something artificial like that,” he said.</p>
<p>“And you can see out of this eye?” she asked, meaning the wounded
one.</p>
<p>“I can see. But I can’t make a fist out of my left hand because this
knife is doing something to my brain.”</p>
<p>“My God,” Nurse said.</p>
<p>“I guess I’d better get the doctor,” I said.</p>
<p>“There you go,” Nurse agreed.</p>
<p>They got him lying down, and Georgie says to the patient, “Name?”</p>
<p>“Terrence Weber.”</p>
<p>“Your face is dark. I can’t see what you’re saying.”</p>
<p>“Georgie,” I said.</p>
<p>“What are you saying, man? I can’t see.”</p>
<p>Nurse came over, and Georgie said to her, “His face is dark.”</p>
<p>She leaned over the patient. “How long ago did this happen, Terry?”
she shouted down into his face.</p>
<p>“Just a while ago. My wife did it. I was asleep,” the patient
said.</p>
<p>“Do you want the police?”</p>
<p>He thought about it and finally said, “Not unless I die.”</p>
<p>Nurse went to the wall intercom and buzzed the doctor on duty, the
Family Service person. “Got a surprise for you,” she said over the
intercom. He took his time getting down the hall to her, because he knew
she hated Family Service and her happy tone of voice could only mean
something beyond his competence and potentially humiliating.</p>
<p>He peeked into the trauma room and saw the situation: the clerk—that
is, me—standing next to the orderly, Georgie, both of us on drugs,
looking down at a patient with a knife sticking up out of his face.</p>
<p>“What seems to be the trouble?” he said.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The doctor gathered the three of us around him in the office and
said, “Here’s the situation. We’ve got to get a team here, an entire
team. I want a good eye man. A great eye man. The best eye man. I want a
brain surgeon. And I want a really good gas man, get me a genius. I’m
not touching that head. I’m just going to watch this one. I know my
limits. We’ll just get him prepped and sit tight. Orderly!”</p>
<p>“Do you mean me?” Georgie said. “Should I get him prepped?”</p>
<p>“Is this a hospital?” the doctor asked. “Is this the emergency room?
Is that a patient? Are you the orderly?”</p>
<p>I dialled the hospital operator and told her to get me the eye man
and the brain man and the gas man.</p>
<p>Georgie could be heard across the hall, washing his hands and singing
a Neil Young song that went “Hello cowgirl in the sand. Is this place at
your command?”</p>
<p>“That person is not right, not at all, not one bit,” the doctor
said.</p>
<p>“As long as my instructions are audible to him it doesn’t concern
me,” Nurse insisted, spooning stuff up out of a little Dixie cup. “I’ve
got my own life and the protection of my family to think of.”</p>
<p>“Well, O.K., O.K. Don’t chew my head off,” the doctor said.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The eye man was on vacation or something. While the hospital’s
operator called around to find someone else just as good, the other
specialists were hurrying through the night to join us. I stood around
looking at charts and chewing up more of Georgie’s pills. Some of them
tasted the way urine smells, some of them burned, some of them tasted
like chalk. Various nurses, and two physicians who’d been tending
somebody in I.C.U., were hanging out down here with us now.</p>
<p>Everybody had a different idea about exactly how to approach the
problem of removing the knife from Terrence Weber’s brain. But when
Georgie came in from prepping the patient—from shaving the patient’s
eyebrow and disinfecting the area around the wound, and so on—he seemed
to be holding the hunting knife in his left hand.</p>
<p>The talk just dropped off a cliff.</p>
<p>“Where,” the doctor asked finally, “did you get that?”</p>
<p>Nobody said one thing more, not for quite a long time.</p>
<p>After a while, one of the I.C.U. nurses said, “Your shoelace is
untied.” Georgie laid the knife on a chart and bent down to fix his
shoe.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>There were twenty more minutes left to get through.</p>
<p>“How’s the guy doing?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Who?” Georgie said.</p>
<p>It turned out that Terrence Weber still had excellent vision in the
one good eye, and acceptable motor and reflex, despite his earlier motor
complaint. “His vitals are normal,” Nurse said. “There’s nothing wrong
with the guy. It’s one of those things.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>After a while you forget it’s summer. You don’t remember what the
morning is. I’d worked two doubles with eight hours off in between,
which I’d spent sleeping on a gurney in the nurses’ station. Georgie’s
pills were making me feel like a giant helium-filled balloon, but I was
wide awake. Georgie and I went out to the lot, to his orange pickup.</p>
<p>We lay down on a stretch of dusty plywood in the back of the truck
with the daylight knocking against our eyelids and the fragrance of
alfalfa thickening on our tongues.</p>
<p>“I want to go to church,” Georgie said.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the county fair.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to worship. I would.”</p>
<p>“They have these injured hawks and eagles there. From the Humane
Society,” I said.</p>
<p>“I need a quiet chapel about now.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Georgie and I had a terrific time driving around. For a while the day
was clear and peaceful. It was one of the moments you stay in, to hell
with all the troubles of before and after. The sky is blue, and the dead
are coming back. Later in the afternoon, with sad resignation, the
county fair bares its breasts. A champion of the drug LSD, a very famous
guru of the love generation, is being interviewed amid a TV crew off to
the left of the poultry cages. His eyeballs look like he bought them in
a joke shop. It doesn’t occur to me, as I pity this extraterrestrial,
that in my life I’ve taken as much acid as he has.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>After that, we got lost. We drove for hours, literally hours, but we
couldn’t find the road back to town.</p>
<p>Georgie started to complain. “That was the worst fair I’ve been to.
Where were the rides?”</p>
<p>“They had rides,” I said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see one ride.”</p>
<p>A jackrabbit scurried out in front of us, and we hit it.</p>
<p>“There was a merry-go-round, a Ferris wheel, and a thing called the
Hammer that people were bent over vomiting from after they got off,” I
said. “Are you completely blind?”</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>“A rabbit.”</p>
<p>“Something thumped.”</p>
<p>“You hit him. He thumped.”</p>
<p>Georgie stood on the brake pedal. “Rabbit stew.”</p>
<p>He threw the truck in reverse and zigzagged back toward the rabbit.
“Where’s my hunting knife?” He almost ran over the poor animal a second
time.</p>
<p>“We’ll camp in the wilderness,” he said. “In the morning we’ll
breakfast on its haunches.” He was waving Terrence Weber’s hunting knife
around in what I was sure was a dangerous way.</p>
<p>In a minute he was standing at the edge of the fields, cutting the
scrawny little thing up, tossing away its organs. “I should have been a
doctor,” he cried.</p>
<p>A family in a big Dodge, the only car we’d seen for a long time,
slowed down and gawked out the windows as they passed by. The father
said, “What is it, a snake?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not a snake,” Georgie said. “It’s a rabbit with babies
inside it.”</p>
<p>“Babies!” the mother said, and the father sped the car forward, over
the protests of several little kids in the back.</p>
<p>Georgie came back to my side of the truck with his shirtfront
stretched out in front of him as if he were carrying apples in it, or
some such, but they were, in fact, slimy miniature bunnies. “No way I’m
eating those things,” I told him.</p>
<p>“Take them, take them. I gotta drive, take them,” he said, dumping
them in my lap and getting in on his side of the truck. He started
driving along faster and faster, with a look of glory on his face. “We
killed the mother and saved the children,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s getting late,” I said. “Let’s get back to town.”</p>
<p>“You bet.” Sixty, seventy, eighty-five, just topping ninety.</p>
<p>“These rabbits better be kept warm.” One at a time I slid the little
things in between my shirt buttons and nestled them against my belly.
“They’re hardly moving,” I told Georgie.</p>
<p>“We’ll get some milk and sugar and all that, and we’ll raise them up
ourselves. They’ll get as big as gorillas.”</p>
<p>The road we were lost on cut straight through the middle of the
world. It was still daytime, but the sun had no more power than an
ornament or a sponge. In this light the truck’s hood, which had been
bright orange, had turned a deep blue.</p>
<p>Georgie let us drift to the shoulder of the road, slowly, slowly, as
if he’d fallen asleep or given up trying to find his way.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“We can’t go on. I don’t have any headlights,” Georgie said.</p>
<p>We parked under a strange sky with a faint image of a quarter-moon
superimposed on it.</p>
<p>There was a little woods beside us. This day had been dry and hot,
the buck pines and what all simmering patiently, but as we sat there
smoking cigarettes it started to get very cold.</p>
<p>“The summer’s over,” I said.</p>
<p>That was the year when arctic clouds moved down over the Midwest, and
we had two weeks of winter in September.</p>
<p>“Do you realize it’s going to snow?” Georgie asked me.</p>
<p>He was right, a gun-blue storm was shaping up. We got out and walked
around idiotically. The beautiful chill! That sudden crispness, and the
tang of evergreen stabbing us!</p>
<p>The gusts of snow twisted themselves around our heads while the night
fell. I couldn’t find the truck. We just kept getting more and more
lost. I kept calling, “Georgie, can you see?” and he kept saying, “See
what? See what?”</p>
<p>The only light visible was a streak of sunset flickering below the
hem of the clouds. We headed that way.</p>
<p>We bumped softly down a hill toward an open field that seemed to be a
military graveyard, filled with rows and rows of austere, identical
markers over soldiers’ graves. I’d never before come across this
cemetery. On the farther side of the field, just beyond the curtains of
snow, the sky was torn away and the angels were descending out of a
brilliant blue summer, their huge faces streaked with light and full of
pity. The sight of them cut through my heart and down the knuckles of my
spine, and if there’d been anything in my bowels I would have messed my
pants from fear.</p>
<p>Georgie opened his arms and cried out, “It’s the drive-in, man!”</p>
<p>“The drive-in…” I wasn’t sure what these words meant.</p>
<p>“They’re showing movies in a fucking blizzard!” Georgie screamed.</p>
<p>“I see. I thought it was something else,” I said.</p>
<p>We walked carefully down there and climbed through the busted fence
and stood in the very back. The speakers, which I’d mistaken for grave
markers, muttered in unison. Then there was tinkly music, of which I
could very nearly make out the tune. Famous movie stars rode bicycles
beside a river, laughing out of their gigantic lovely mouths. If anybody
had come to see this show, they’d left when the weather started. Not one
car remained, not even a broken-down one from last week, or one left
here because it was out of gas. In a couple of minutes, in the middle of
a whirling square dance, the screen turned black, the cinematic summer
ended, the snow went dark, there was nothing but my breath.</p>
<p>“I’m starting to get my eyes back,” Georgie said in another
minute.</p>
<p>A general grayness was giving birth to various shapes, it was true.
“But which ones are close and which ones are far off?” I begged him to
tell me.</p>
<p>By trial and error, with a lot of walking back and forth in wet
shoes, we found the truck and sat inside it, shivering.</p>
<p>“Let’s get out of here,” I said.</p>
<p>“We can’t go anywhere without headlights.”</p>
<p>“We’ve gotta get back. We’re a long way from home.”</p>
<p>“No, we’re not.”</p>
<p>“We must have come three hundred miles.”</p>
<p>“We’re right outside town, Fuckhead. We’ve just been driving around
and around.”</p>
<p>“This is no place to camp. I hear the interstate over there.”</p>
<p>“We’ll just stay here till it gets late. We can drive home late.
We’ll be invisible.”</p>
<p>We listened to the big rigs going from San Francisco to Pennsylvania
along the interstate, like shudders down a long hacksaw blade, while the
snow buried us.</p>
<p>Eventually Georgie said, “We better get some milk for those
bunnies.”</p>
<p>“We don’t have milk,” I said.</p>
<p>“We’ll mix sugar up with it.”</p>
<p>“Will you forget about this milk all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“They’re mammals, man.”</p>
<p>“Forget about those rabbits.”</p>
<p>“Where are they, anyway?”</p>
<p>“You’re not listening to me. I said, ‘Forget the rabbits.’ ”</p>
<p>“Where are they?”</p>
<p>The truth was I’d forgotten all about them, and they were dead.</p>
<p>“They slid around behind me and got squashed,” I said tearfully.</p>
<p>“They slid around behind?”</p>
<p>He watched while I pried them out from behind my back.</p>
<p>I picked them out one at a time and held them in my hands and we
looked at them. There were eight. They weren’t any bigger than my
fingers, but everything was there.</p>
<p>Little feet! Eyelids! Even whiskers! “Deceased,” I said.</p>
<p>Georgie asked, “Does everything you touch turn to shit? Does this
happen to you every time?”</p>
<p>“No wonder they call me Fuckhead.”</p>
<p>“It’s a name that’s going to stick.”</p>
<p>“I realize that.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Fuckhead’ is gonna ride you to your grave.”</p>
<p>“I just said so. I agreed with you in advance,” I said.</p>
<p>Or maybe that wasn’t the time it snowed. Maybe it was the time we
slept in the truck and I rolled over on the bunnies and flattened them.
It doesn’t matter. What’s important for me to remember now is that early
the next morning the snow was melted off the windshield and the daylight
woke me up. A mist covered everything and, with the sunshine, was
beginning to grow sharp and strange. The bunnies weren’t a problem yet,
or they’d already been a problem and were already forgotten, and there
was nothing on my mind. I felt the beauty of the morning. I could
understand how a drowning man might suddenly feel a deep thirst being
quenched. Or how the slave might become a friend to his master. Georgie
slept with his face right on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>I saw bits of snow resembling an abundance of blossoms on the stems
of the drive-in speakers—no, revealing the blossoms that were always
there. A bull elk stood still in the pasture beyond the fence giving off
an air of authority and stupidity. And a coyote jogged across the
pasture and faded away among the saplings.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>That afternoon we got back to work in time to resume everything as if
it had never stopped happening and we’d never been anywhere else.</p>
<p>“The Lord,” the intercom said, “is my shepherd.” It did that each
evening because this was a Catholic hospital. “Our Father, who art in
Heaven,” and so on.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” Nurse said.</p>
<p>The man with the knife in his head, Terrence Weber, was released
around suppertime. They’d kept him overnight and given him an
eyepatch—all for no reason, really.</p>
<p>He stopped off at E.R. to say goodbye. “Well, those pills they gave
me make everything taste terrible,” he said.</p>
<p>“It could have been worse,” Nurse said.</p>
<p>“Even my tongue.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a miracle you didn’t end up sightless or at least dead,”
she reminded him.</p>
<p>The patient recognized me. He acknowledged me with a smile. “I was
peeping on the lady next door while she was out there sunbathing,” he
said. “My wife decided to blind me.”</p>
<p>He shook Georgie’s hand. Georgie didn’t know him. “Who are you
supposed to be?” he asked Terrence Weber.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Some hours before that, Georgie had said something that had suddenly
and completely explained the difference between us. We’d been driving
back toward town, along the Old Highway, through the flatness. We picked
up a hitchhiker, a boy I knew. We stopped the truck and the boy climbed
slowly up out of the fields as out of the mouth of a volcano. His name
was Hardee. He looked even worse than we probably did.</p>
<p>“We got messed up and slept in the truck all night,” I told
Hardee.</p>
<p>“I had a feeling,” Hardee said. “Either that or, you know, driving a
thousand miles.”</p>
<p>“That, too,” I said.</p>
<p>“Or you’re sick or diseased or something.”</p>
<p>“Who’s this guy?” Georgie asked.</p>
<p>“This is Hardee. He lived with me last summer. I found him on the
doorstep. What happened to your dog?” I asked Hardee.</p>
<p>“He’s still down there.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I heard you went to Texas.”</p>
<p>“I was working on a bee farm,” Hardee said.</p>
<p>“Wow. Do those things sting you?”</p>
<p>“Not like you’d think,” Hardee said. “You’re part of their daily
drill. It’s all part of a harmony.”</p>
<p>Outside, the same identical stretch of ground repeatedly rolled past
our faces. The day was cloudless, blinding. But Georgie said, “Look at
that,” pointing straight ahead of us.</p>
<p>One star was so hot it showed, bright and blue, in the empty sky.</p>
<p>“I recognized you right away,” I told Hardee. “But what happened to
your hair? Who chopped it off?”</p>
<p>“I hate to say.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me.”</p>
<p>“They drafted me.”</p>
<p>“Oh no.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah. I’m AWOL. I’m bad AWOL. I got to get to Canada.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s terrible,” I said to Hardee.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Georgie said. “We’ll get you there.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“Somehow. I think I know some people. Don’t worry. You’re on your way
to Canada.”</p>
<p>That world! These days it’s all been erased and they’ve rolled it up
like a scroll and put it away somewhere. Yes, I can touch it with my
fingers. But where is it?</p>
<p>After a while Hardee asked Georgie, “What do you do for a job?,” and
Georgie said, “I save lives.”</p>
