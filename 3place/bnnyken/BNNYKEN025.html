<h4 id="the-book-of-sand">The Book of Sand</h4>
<p>By Jorge Luis Borges (1976)</p>
<p>Thy rope of sands…</p>
<p>—George Herbert</p>
<p>The line is made up of an infinite number of points; the plane of an
infinite number of lines; the volume of an infinite number of planes;
the hypervolume of an infinite number of volumes…. No, unquestionably
this is not—more geometrico—the best way of beginning my story. To claim
that it is true is nowadays the convention of every made-up story. Mine,
however, is true.</p>
<p>I live alone in a fourth-floor apartment on Belgrano Street, in
Buenos Aires. Late one evening, a few months back, I heard a knock at my
door. I opened it and a stranger stood there. He was a tall man, with
nondescript features—or perhaps it was my myopia that made them seem
that way. Dressed in gray and carrying a gray suitcase in his hand, he
had an unassuming look about him. I saw at once that he was a foreigner.
At first, he struck me as old; only later did I realize that I had been
misled by his thin blond hair, which was, in a Scandinavian sort of way,
almost white. During the course of our conversation, which was not to
last an hour, I found out that he came from the Orkneys.</p>
<p>I invited him in, pointing to a chair. He paused awhile before
speaking. A kind of gloom emanated from him—as it does now from me.</p>
<p>“I sell Bibles,” he said.</p>
<p>Somewhat pedantically, I replied, “In this house are several English
Bibles, including the first—John Wiclif’s. I also have Cipriano de
Valera’s, Luther’s—which, from a literary viewpoint, is the worst—and a
Latin copy of the Vulgate. As you see, it’s not exactly Bibles I stand
in need of.”</p>
<p>After a few moments of silence, he said, “I don’t only sell Bibles. I
can show you a holy book I came across on the outskirts of Bikaner. It
may interest you.”</p>
<p>He opened the suitcase and lay the book on a table. It was an octavo
volume, bound in cloth. There was no doubt that it had passed through
many hands. Examining it, I was surprised by its unusual weight. On the
spine were the words “Holy Writ” and, below them, “Bombay.”</p>
<p>“Nineteenth-century, probably,” I remarked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “I’ve never found out.”</p>
<p>I opened the book at random. The script was strange to me. The pages,
which were worn and typographically poor, were laid out in double
columns, as in a Bible. The text was closely printed, and it was ordered
in versicles. In the upper corners of the pages were Arabic numbers. I
noticed that one left-hand page bore the number (let us say) 40,514 and
the facing right-hand page 999. I turned the leaf; it was numbered with
eight digits. It also bore a small illustration, like the kind used in
dictionaries—an anchor drawn with pen and ink, as if by a schoolboy’s
clumsy hand.</p>
<p>It was at this point that the stranger said, “Look at the
illustration closely. You’ll never see it again.”</p>
<p>I noted my place and closed the book. At once, I reopened it. Page by
page, in vain, I looked for the illustration of the anchor. “It seems to
be a version of Scriptures in some Indian language, is it not?” I said
to hide my dismay.</p>
<p>“No,” he replied. Then, as if confiding a secret, he lowered his
voice. “I acquired the book in a town out on the plain in exchange for a
handful of rupees and a Bible. Its owner did not know how to read. I
suspect that he saw the Book of Books as a talisman. He was of the
lowest caste; nobody but other untouchables could tread his shadow
without contamination. He told me his book was called the Book of Sand,
because neither the book nor the sand has any beginning or end.”</p>
<p>The stranger asked me to find the first page.</p>
<p>I lay my left hand on the cover and, trying to put my thumb on the
flyleaf, I opened the book. It was useless. Every time I tried, a number
of pages came between the cover and my thumb. It was as if they kept
growing from the book.</p>
<p>“Now find the last page.”</p>
<p>Again I failed. In a voice that was not mine, I barely managed to
stammer, “This can’t be.”</p>
<p>Still speaking in a low voice, the stranger said, “It can’t be, but
it is. The number of pages in this book is no more or less than
infinite. None is the first page, none the last. I don’t know why
they’re numbered in this arbitrary way. Perhaps to suggest that the
terms of an infinite series admit any number.”</p>
<p>Then, as if he were thinking aloud, he said, “If space is infinite,
we may be at any point in space. If time is infinite, we may be at any
point in time.”</p>
<p>His speculations irritated me. “You are religious, no doubt?” I asked
him.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m a Presbyterian. My conscience is clear. I am reasonably
sure of not having cheated the native when I gave him the Word of God in
exchange for his devilish book.”</p>
<p>I assured him that he had nothing to reproach himself for, and I
asked if he were just passing through this part of the world. He replied
that he planned to return to his country in a few days. It was then that
I learned that he was a Scot from the Orkney Islands. I told him I had a
great personal affection for Scotland, through my love of Stevenson and
Hume.</p>
<p>“You mean Stevenson and Robbie Burns,” he corrected.</p>
<p>While we spoke, I kept exploring the infinite book. With feigned
indifference, I asked, “Do you intend to offer this curiosity to the
British Museum?”</p>
<p>“No. I’m offering it to you,” he said, and he stipulated a rather
high sum for the book.</p>
<p>I answered, in all truthfulness, that such a sum was out of my reach,
and I began thinking. After a minute or two, I came up with a
scheme.</p>
<p>“I propose a swap,” I said. “You got this book for a handful of
rupees and a copy of the Bible. I’ll offer you the amount of my pension
check, which I’ve just collected, and my black-letter Wiclif Bible. I
inherited it from my ancestors.”</p>
<p>“A black-letter Wiclif!” he murmured.</p>
<p>I went to my bedroom and brought him the money and the book. He
turned the leaves and studied the title page with all the fervor of a
true bibliophile.</p>
<p>“It’s a deal,” he said.</p>
<p>It amazed me that he did not haggle. Only later was I to realize that
he had entered my house with his mind made up to sell the book. Without
counting the money, he put it away.</p>
<p>We talked about India, about Orkney, and about the Norwegian jarls
who once ruled it. It was night when the man left. I have not seen him
again, nor do I know his name.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>I thought of keeping the Book of Sand in the space left on the shelf
by the Wiclif, but in the end I decided to hide it behind the volumes of
a broken set of “The Thousand and One Nights.” I went to bed and did not
sleep. At three or four in the morning, I turned on the light. I got
down the impossible book and leafed through its pages. On one of them I
saw engraved a mask. The upper corner of the page carried a number,
which I no longer recall, elevated to the ninth power.</p>
<p>I showed no one my treasure. To the luck of owning it was added the
fear of having it stolen, and then the misgiving that it might not truly
be infinite. These twin preoccupations intensified my old misanthropy. I
had only a few friends left; I now stopped seeing even them. A prisoner
of the book, I almost never went out anymore. After studying its frayed
spine and covers with a magnifying glass, I rejected the possibility of
a contrivance of any sort. The small illustrations, I verified, came two
thousand pages apart. I set about listing them alphabetically in a
notebook, which I was not long in filling up. Never once was an
illustration repeated. At night, in the meagre intervals my insomnia
granted, I dreamed of the book.</p>
<p>Summer came and went, and I realized that the book was monstrous.
What good did it do me to think that I, who looked upon the volume with
my eyes, who held it in my hands, was any less monstrous? I felt that
the book was a nightmarish object, an obscene thing that affronted and
tainted reality itself.</p>
<p>I thought of fire, but I feared that the burning of an infinite book
might likewise prove infinite and suffocate the planet with smoke.
Somewhere I recalled reading that the best place to hide a leaf is in a
forest. Before retirement, I worked on Mexico Street, at the Argentine
National Library, which contains nine hundred thousand volumes. I knew
that to the right of the entrance a curved staircase leads down into the
basement, where books and maps and periodicals are kept. One day I went
there and, slipping past a member of the staff and trying not to notice
at what height or distance from the door, I lost the Book of Sand on one
of the basement’s musty shelves.</p>
