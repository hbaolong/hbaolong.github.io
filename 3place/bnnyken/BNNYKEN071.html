<h4 id="the-midnight-zone">The Midnight Zone</h4>
<p>By Lauren Groff (2016)</p>
<p>It was an old hunting camp shipwrecked in twenty miles of scrub. Our
friend had seen a Florida panther sliding through the trees there a few
days earlier. But things had been fraying in our hands, and the camp was
free and silent, so I walked through the resistance of my cautious
husband and my small boys, who had wanted hermit crabs and kites and
wakeboards and sand for spring break. Instead, they got ancient
sinkholes filled with ferns, potential death by cat.</p>
<p>One thing I liked was how the screens at night pulsed with the tender
bellies of lizards.</p>
<p>Even in the sleeping bag with my smaller son, the golden one, the
March chill seemed to blow through my bones. I loved eating, but I’d
lost so much weight by then that I carried myself delicately, as if I’d
gone translucent.</p>
<p>There was sparse electricity from a gas-powered generator and no
Internet and you had to climb out through the window in the loft and
stand on the roof to get a cell signal. On the third day, the boys were
asleep and I’d dimmed the lanterns when my husband went up and out and I
heard him stepping on the metal roof, a giant brother to the raccoons
that woke us thumping around up there at night like burglars.</p>
<p>Then my husband stopped moving, and stood still for so long I forgot
where he was. When he came down the ladder from the loft, his face had
blanched.</p>
<p>Who died? I said lightly, because if anyone was going to die it was
going to be us, our skulls popping in the jaws of an endangered cat. It
turned out to be a bad joke, because someone actually had died, that
morning, in one of my husband’s apartment buildings. A fifth-floor
occupant had killed herself, maybe on purpose, with aspirin and vodka
and a bathtub. Floors four, three, and two were away somewhere with
beaches and alcoholic smoothies, and the first floor had discovered the
problem only when the water of death had seeped into the carpet.</p>
<p>My husband had to leave. He’d just fired one handyman and the other
was on his own Caribbean adventure, eating buffet food to the sound of
cruise-ship calypso. Let’s pack, my husband said, but my rebelliousness
at the time was like a sticky fog rolling through my body and never
burning off, there was no sun inside, and so I said that the boys and I
would stay. He looked at me as if I were crazy and asked how we’d manage
with no car. I asked if he thought he’d married an incompetent woman,
which cut to the bone, because the source of our problems was that, in
fact, he had. For years at a time I was good only at the things that
interested me, and since all that interested me was my work and my
children, the rest of life had sort of inched away. And while it’s true
that my children were endlessly fascinating, two petri dishes growing
human cultures, being a mother never had been, and all that seemed
assigned by default of gender I would not do because it felt insulting.
I would not buy clothes, I would not make dinner, I would not keep
schedules, I would not make playdates, never ever. Motherhood meant, for
me, that I would take the boys on monthlong adventures to Europe, teach
them to blast off rockets, to swim for glory. I taught them how to read,
but they could make their own lunches. I would hug them as long as they
wanted to be hugged, but that was just being human. My husband had to be
the one to make up for the depths of my lack. It is exhausting, living
in debt that increases every day but that you have no intention of
repaying.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Two days, he promised. Two days and he’d be back by noon on the
third. He bent to kiss me, but I gave him my cheek and rolled over when
the headlights blazed then dwindled on the wall. In the banishing of the
engine, the night grew bold. The wind was making a low, inhuman
muttering in the pines, and, inspired, the animals let loose in
call-and-response. Everything kept me alert until shortly before dawn,
when I slept for a few minutes until the puppy whined and woke me. My
older son was crying because he’d thrown off his sleeping bag in the
night and was cold but too sleepy to fix the situation.</p>
<p>I made scrambled eggs with a vengeful amount of butter and Cheddar,
also cocoa with an inch of marshmallow, thinking I would stupefy my
children with calories, but the calories only made them stronger.</p>
<p>Our friend had treated the perimeter of the clearing with panther
deterrent, some kind of synthetic superpredator urine, and we felt
safe-ish near the cabin. We ran footraces until the dog went wild and
leapt up and bit my children’s arms with her puppy teeth, and the boys
screamed with pain and frustration and showed me the pink stripes on
their skin. I scolded the puppy harshly and she crept off to the porch
to watch us with her chin on her paws. The boys and I played soccer. We
rocked in the hammock. We watched the circling red-shouldered hawks. I
made my older son read “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” to the little
one, which was a disaster, a book so punny and Victorian for modern
children. We had lunch, then the older boy tried to make fire by rubbing
sticks together, his little brother attending solemnly, and they spent
the rest of the day constructing a hut out of branches. Then dinner,
singing songs, a bath in the galvanized-steel horse trough someone had
converted to a cold-water tub, picking ticks and chiggers off with
tweezers, and that was it for the first day.</p>
<p>There had been a weight on us as we played outside, not as if
something were actually watching but because of the possibility that
something could be watching when we were so far from humanity in all
that Florida waste.</p>
<p>The second day should have been like the first. I doubled down on the
calories, adding pancakes to breakfast, and succeeded in making the boys
lie in pensive digestion out in the hammock for a little while before
they ricocheted off the trees.</p>
<p>But in the afternoon the one light bulb sizzled out. The cabin was
all dark wood and I couldn’t see the patterns on the dishes I was
washing. I found a new bulb in a closet, dragged over a stool from the
bar area, and made the older boy hold the spinning seat as I climbed
aboard. The old bulb was hot, and I was passing it from hand to hand,
holding the new bulb under my arm, when the puppy leapt up at my older
son’s face. He let go of the stool to whack at her, and I did a quarter
spin, then fell and hit the floor with my head, and then I surely
blacked out.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>After a while, I opened my eyes. Two children were looking down at
me. They were pale and familiar. One fair, one dark; one small, one
big.</p>
<p>Mommy? the little boy said, through water.</p>
<p>I turned my head and threw up on the floor. The bigger boy dragged a
puppy, who was snuffling my face, out the door.</p>
<p>I knew very little except that I was in pain and that I shouldn’t
move. The older boy bent over me, then lifted an intact light bulb from
my armpit, triumphantly; I a chicken, the bulb an egg.</p>
<p>The smaller boy had a wet paper towel in his hand and he was patting
my cheeks. The pulpy smell made me ill again. I closed my eyes and felt
the dabbing on my forehead, on my neck, around my mouth. The small
child’s voice was high. He was singing a song.</p>
<p>I started to cry with my eyes closed and the tears went hot across my
temples and into my ears.</p>
<p>Mommy! the older boy, the solemn dark one, screamed, and when I
opened my eyes both of the children were crying, and that was how I knew
them to be mine.</p>
<p>Just let me rest here a minute, I said. They took my hands. I could
feel the hot hands of my children, which was good. I moved my toes, then
my feet. I turned my head back and forth. My neck worked, though
fireworks went off in the corners of my eyes.</p>
<p>I can walk to town, the older boy was saying, through wadding, to his
brother, but the nearest town was twenty miles away. Safety was twenty
miles away and there was a panther between us and there, but also
possibly terrible men, sinkholes, alligators, the end of the world.
There was no landline, no umbilical cord, and small boys using cell
phones would easily fall off such a slick, pitched metal roof.</p>
<p>But what if she’s all a sudden dead and I’m all a sudden alone? the
little boy was saying.</p>
<p>O.K., I’m sitting up now, I said.</p>
<p>The puppy was howling at the door.</p>
<p>I lifted my body onto my elbows. Gingerly, I sat. The cabin dipped
and spun and I vomited again.</p>
<p>The big boy ran out and came back with a broom to clean up. No! I
said. I am always too hard on him, this beautiful child who is so
brilliant, who has no logic at all.</p>
<p>Sweetness, I said, and couldn’t stop crying, because I’d called him
Sweetness instead of his name, which I couldn’t remember just then. I
took five or six deep breaths. Thank you, I said in a calmer voice. Just
throw a whole bunch of paper towels on it and drag the rug over it to
keep the dog off. The little one did so, methodically, which was not his
style; he has always been adept at cheerfully watching other people work
for him.</p>
<p>The bigger boy tried to get me to drink water, because this is what
we do in our family in lieu of applying Band-Aids, which I refuse to buy
because they are just flesh-colored landfill.</p>
<p>Then the little boy screamed, because he’d moved around me and seen
the bloody back of my head, and then he dabbed at the cut with the paper
towel he had previously dabbed at my pukey mouth. The paper
disintegrated in his hands. He crawled into my lap and put his face on
my stomach. The bigger boy held something cold on my wound, which I
discovered later to be a beer can from the fridge.</p>
<p>They were quiet like this for a very long time. The boys’ names came
back to me, at first dancing coyly out of reach, then, when I seized
them in my hands, mine.</p>
<p>I’d been a soccer player in high school, a speedy and aggressive
midfielder, and head trauma was an old friend. I remembered this
constant lability from one concussive visit to the emergency room. The
confusion and the sense of doom were also familiar. I had a flash of my
mother sitting beside my bed for an entire night, shaking me awake
whenever I tried to fall asleep, and I now wanted my mother, not in her
diminished current state, brittle retiree, but as she had been when I
was young, a small person but gigantic, a person who had blocked out the
sun.</p>
<p>I sent the little boy off to get a roll of dusty duct tape, the
bigger boy to get gauze from my toiletry kit, and when they wandered
back I duct-taped the gauze to my head, already mourning my long hair,
which had been my most expensive pet.</p>
<p>I inched myself across the room to the bed and climbed up, despite
the sparklers behind my eyeballs. The boys let the forlorn puppy in, and
when they opened the door they also let the night in, because my fall
had taken hours from our lives.</p>
<p>It was only then, when the night entered, that I understood the depth
of time we had yet to face. I had the boys bring me the lanterns, then a
can opener and the tuna and the beans, which I opened slowly, because it
is not easy, supine, and we made a game out of eating, though the
thought of eating anything gave me chills. The older boy brought over
Mason jars of milk. I let my children finish the entire half gallon of
ice cream, which was my husband’s, his one daily reward for being kind
and good, but by this point the man deserved our disloyalty, because he
was not there.</p>
<p>It had started raining, at first a gentle thrumming on the metal
roof.</p>
<p>I tried to tell my children a cautionary tale about a little girl who
fell into a well and had to wait a week until firefighters could figure
out a way to rescue her, something that maybe actually took place back
in the dimness of my childhood, but the story was either too abstract
for them or I wasn’t making much sense, and they didn’t seem to grasp my
need for them to stay in the cabin, to not go anywhere, if the very
worst happened, the unthinkable that I was skirting, like a pit that
opened just in front of each sentence I was about to utter. They kept
asking me if the girl got lots of toys when she made it out of the well.
This was so against my point that I said, out of spite, Unfortunately,
no, she did not.</p>
<p>I made the boys keep me awake with stories. The younger one was into
a British television show about marine life, which the older one
maintained was babyish until I pretended not to believe what they were
telling me. Then they both told me about cookie-cutter sharks, who bore
perfect round holes in whales, as if their mouths were cookie cutters.
They told me about a fish called the humuhumunukunukuāpua’a, a beautiful
name that I couldn’t say correctly, even though they sang it to me over
and over, laughing, to the tune of “Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star.” They
told me about the walking catfish, which can stay out of water for days
and days, meandering about in the mud. They told me about the sunlight,
the twilight, and the midnight zones, the three depths of water, where
there is transparent light, then a murky, darkish light, then no light
at all. They told me about the world pool, in which one current goes one
way, another goes another way, and where they meet they make a tornado
of air, which stretches, my little one said, from the midnight zone,
where the fish are blind, all the way up up up to the birds.</p>
<p>I had begun shaking very hard, which my children, sudden gentlemen,
didn’t mention. They piled all the sleeping bags and blankets they could
find on me, then climbed under and fell asleep without bathing or
toothbrushing or getting out of their dirty clothes, which, anyway, they
sweated through within an hour.</p>
<p>The dog did not get dinner but she didn’t whine about it, and though
she wasn’t allowed to, she came up on the bed and slept with her head on
my older son’s stomach, because he was her favorite, being the biggest
puppy of all.</p>
<p>Now I had only myself to sit vigil with me, though it was still
early, nine or ten at night.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>I had a European novel on the nightstand that filled me with dimness
and fret, so I tried to read “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” but it
was incomprehensible with my scrambled brains. Then I looked at a
hunting magazine, which made me remember the Florida panther. I hadn’t
truly forgotten about it, but could manage only a few terrors at a time,
and others, when my children had been awake, were more urgent. We had
seen some scat in the woods on a walk three days earlier, enormous scat,
either a bear’s or the panther’s, but certainly a giant predator’s. The
danger had been abstract until we saw this bodily proof of existence,
and my husband and I led the children home, singing a round, all four of
us holding hands, and we let the dog off the leash to circle us
joyously, because, as small as she was, it was bred in her bones that in
the face of peril she would sacrifice herself first.</p>
<p>The rain increased until it was deafening and still my sweaty
children slept. I thought of the waves of sleep rushing through their
brains, washing out the tiny unimportant flotsam of today so that
tomorrow’s heavier truths could wash in. There was a nice solidity to
the rain’s pounding on the roof, as if the noise were a barrier that
nothing could enter, a stay against the looming night.</p>
<p>I tried to bring back the poems of my youth, and could not remember
more than a few floating lines, which I put together into a strange, sad
poem, Blake and Dickinson and Frost and Milton and Sexton, a tag-sale
poem in clammy meter that nonetheless came alive and held my hand for a
little while.</p>
<p>Then the rain diminished until all that was left were scattered
clicks from the drops falling from the pines. The batteries of one
lantern went out and the light from the remaining lantern was sparse and
thwarted. I could hardly see my hand or the shadow it made on the wall
when I held it up. This lantern was my sister; at any moment it, too,
could go dark. I feasted my eyes on the cabin, which in the oncoming
black had turned into a place made of gold, but the shadows seemed too
thick now, fizzy at the edges, and they moved when I shifted my eyes
away from them. It felt safer to look at the cheeks of my sleeping
children, creamy as cheeses.</p>
<p>It was elegiac, that last hour or so of light, and I tried to push my
love for my sons into them where their bodies were touching my own
skin.</p>
<p>The wind rose again and it had personality; it was in a sharpish,
meanish mood. It rubbed itself against the little cabin and played at
the corners and broke sticks off the trees and tossed them at the roof
so they jigged down like creatures with strange and scrabbling claws.
The wind rustled its endless body against the door.</p>
<p>Everything depended on my staying still, but my skin was stuffed with
itches. Something terrible in me, the darkest thing, wanted to slam my
own head back against the headboard. I imagined it over and over, the
sharp backward crack, and the wash and spill of peace.</p>
<p>I counted slow breaths and was not calm by two hundred; I counted to
a thousand.</p>
<p>The lantern flicked itself out and the dark poured in.</p>
<p>The moon rose in the skylight and backed itself across the black.</p>
<p>When it was gone and I was alone again, I felt the dissociation, a
physical shifting, as if the best of me were detaching from my body and
sitting down a few feet distant. It was a great relief.</p>
<p>For a few moments, there was a sense of mutual watching, a wait for
something definitive, though nothing definitive came, and then the
bodiless me stood and circled the cabin. The dog moved and gave a soft
whine through her nose, although she remained asleep. The floors were
cool underfoot. My head brushed the beams, though they were ten feet up.
Where my body and those of my two sons lay together was a black and
pulsing mass, a hole of light.</p>
<p>I passed outside. The path was pale dirt and filled with sandspur and
was cold and wet after the rain. The great drops from the tree branches
left a pine taste in me. The forest was not dark, because darkness has
nothing to do with the forest—the forest is made of life, of light—but
the trees moved with wind and subtle creatures. I wasn’t in any single
place. I was with the raccoons of the rooftop, who were now down
fiddling with the bicycle lock on the garbage can at the end of the
road, with the red-shouldered hawk chicks breathing alone in the nest,
with the armadillo forcing its armored body through the brush. I hadn’t
realized that I’d lost my sense of smell until it returned hungrily now;
I could smell the worms tracing their paths under the pine needles and
the mold breathing out new spores, shaken alive by the rain.</p>
<p>I was vigilant, moving softly in the underbrush, and the palmettos’
nails scraped down my body.</p>
<p>The cabin was not visible, but it was present, a sore at my side, a
feeling of density and airlessness. I couldn’t go away from it, I
couldn’t return, I could only circle the cabin and circle it. With each
circle, a terrible, stinging anguish built in me and I had to move
faster and faster, each pass bringing up ever more wildness. What had
been built to seem so solid was fragile in the face of time because time
is impassive, more animal than human. Time would not care if you fell
out of it. It would continue on without you. It cannot see you; it has
always been blind to the human and the things we do to stave it off, the
taxonomies, the cleaning, the arranging, the ordering. Even this cabin
with its perfectly considered angles, its veins of pipes and wires, was
barely more stable than the rake marks we made in the dust that morning,
which time had already scrubbed away.</p>
<p>The self in the woods ran and ran, but the running couldn’t hold off
the slow shift. A low mist rose from the ground and gradually came
clearer. The first birds sent their questions into the chilly air. The
sky developed its blue. The sun emerged.</p>
<p>The drawing back was gradual. My older son opened his brown eyes and
saw me sitting above him.</p>
<p>You look terrible, he said, patting my face, and my hearing was only
half underwater now.</p>
<p>My head ached, so I held my mouth shut and smiled with my eyes and he
padded off to the kitchen and came back with peanut-butter-and-jelly
sandwiches, with a set of Uno cards, with cold coffee from yesterday’s
pot for the low and constant thunder of my headache, with the dog whom
he’d let out and then fed all by himself.</p>
<p>I watched him. He gleamed. My little son woke but didn’t get up, as
if his face were attached to my shoulder by the skin. He was rubbing one
unbloodied lock of my hair on his lips, the way he did after he nursed
when he was a baby.</p>
<p>My boys were not unhappy. I was usually a preoccupied mother, short
with them, busy, working, until I burst into fun, then went back to my
hole of work; now I could only sit with them, talk to them. I could not
even read. They were gentle with me, reminded me of a golden retriever
I’d grown up with, a dog with a mouth so soft she would go down to the
lake and steal ducklings and hold them intact on her tongue for hours
until we noticed her sitting unusually erect in the corner, looking sly.
My boys were like their father; they would one day be men who would take
care of the people they loved.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes as the boys played game after game after game of
Uno.</p>
<p>Noon arrived, noon left, and my husband did not come.</p>
<p>At one point, something passed across the woods outside like a
shudder, and a hush fell over everything, and the boys and the dog all
looked at me and their faces were like pale birds taking flight, but my
hearing had mercifully shut off whatever had occasioned such swift
terror over all creatures of the earth, save me.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>When we heard the car from afar at four in the afternoon, the boys
jumped up. They burst out of the cabin, leaving the door wide open to
the blazing light, which hurt my eyes. I heard their father’s voice, and
then his footsteps, and he was running, and behind him the boys were
running, the dog was running. Here were my husband’s feet on the dirt
drive. Here were his feet heavy on the porch.</p>
<p>For a half-breath, I would have vanished myself. I was everything we
had fretted about, this passive Queen of Chaos with her bloody duct-tape
crown. My husband filled the door. He is a man born to fill doors. I
shut my eyes. When I opened them, he was enormous above me. In his face
was a thing that made me go quiet inside, made a long slow sizzle creep
up my arms from the fingertips, because the thing I read in his face was
the worst, it was fear, and it was vast, it was elemental, like the wind
itself, like the cold sun I would soon feel on the silk of my pelt.</p>
