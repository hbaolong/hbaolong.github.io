<h4 id="i-live-on-your-visits">I Live on Your Visits</h4>
<p>By Dorothy Parker (1955)</p>
<p>The boy came into the hotel room and immediately it seemed even
smaller.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s cool in here,” he said. This was not meant as a comment on
the temperature. “Cool,” for reasons possibly known in some department
of Heaven, was a term then in use among many of those of his age to
express approbation.</p>
<p>It was indeed cool in the room, after the hard gray rain in the
streets. It was warm, and it was so bright. The many-watted electric
bulbs his mother insisted upon were undimmed by the thin frilled shades
she had set on the hotel lamps, and there were shiny things everywhere:
sheets of mirror along the walls; a square of mirror backing the
mirror-plated knob on the door that led to the bedroom; cigarette boxes
made of tiny bits of mirror and matchboxes slipped into little mirror
jackets placed all about; and, on consoles and desk and table,
photographs of himself at two and a half and five and seven and nine
framed in broad mirror bands. Whenever his mother settled in a new
domicile, and she removed often, those photographs were the first things
out of the luggage. The boy hated them. He had had to pass his fifteenth
birthday before his body had caught up with his head; there was that
head, in those presentments of his former selves, that pale, enormous
blob. Once he had asked his mother to put the pictures somewhere
else—preferably some small, dark place that could be locked. But he had
had the bad fortune to make his request on one of the occasions when she
was given to weeping suddenly and long. So the photographs stood out on
parade, with their frames twinkling away.</p>
<p>There were twinklings, too, from the silver top of the fat crystal
cocktail shaker, but the liquid low within the crystal was pale and
dull. There was no shine, either, to the glass his mother held. It was
cloudy from the clutch of her hand, and on the inside there were oily
dribbles of what it had contained.</p>
<p>His mother shut the door by which she had admitted him, and followed
him into the room. She looked at him with her head tilted to the
side.</p>
<p>“Well, aren’t you going to kiss me?” she said in a charming,
wheedling voice, the voice of a little, little girl. “Aren’t you, you
beautiful big ox, you?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” he said. He bent down toward her, but she stepped suddenly
away. A sharp change came over her. She drew herself tall, with her
shoulders back and her head flung high. Her upper lip lifted over her
teeth, and her gaze came cold beneath lowered lids. So does one who has
refused the white handkerchief regard the firing squad.</p>
<p>“Of course,” she said in a deep, iced voice that gave each word its
full due, “if you do not wish to kiss me, let it be recognized that
there is no need for you to do so. I had not meant to overstep. I
apologize. Je vous demande pardon. I had no desire to force you. I have
never forced you. There is none to say I have.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Mom,” he said. He went to her, bent again, and this time kissed
her cheek.</p>
<p>There was no change in her, save in the slow, somehow offended
lifting of her eyelids. The brows arched as if they drew the lids up
with them. “Thank you,” she said. “That was gracious of you. I value
graciousness. I rank it high. Mille grazie.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Mom,” he said.</p>
<p>For the past week, up at his school, he had hoped—and coming down in
the train he had hoped so hard that it became prayer—that his mother
would not be what he thought of only as “like that.” His prayer had gone
unanswered. He knew by the two voices, by the head first tilted then
held high, by the eyelids lowered in disdain then raised in outrage, by
the little lisped words and then the elegant enunciation and the lofty
diction. He knew.</p>
<p>He stood there and said, “Ah, Mom.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” she said, “you will award yourself the privilege of
meeting a friend of mine. She is a true friend. I am proud that I may
say it.”</p>
<p>There was someone else in the room. It was preposterous that he had
not seen her, for she was so big. Perhaps his eyes had been dazzled,
after the dim-lit hotel corridor; perhaps his attention had been all for
his mother. At any rate, there she sat, the true friend, on the sofa
covered with embossed cotton fabric of the sickened green that is
peculiar to hotel upholsteries. There she sat, at one end of the sofa,
and it seemed as if the other end must fly up into the air.</p>
<p>“I can give you but little,” his mother said, “yet life is still kind
enough to let me give you something you will always remember. Through
me, you will meet a human being.”</p>
<p>Yes, oh, yes. The voices, the stances, the eyelids—those were the
signs. But when his mother divided the race into people and human
beings—that was the certainty.</p>
<p>He followed her the little way across the room, trying not to tread
on the train of her velvet tea gown that slid along the floor after her
and slapped at the heels of her gilt slippers. Fog seemed to rise from
his raincoat and his shoes cheeped. He turned out to avoid the coffee
table in front of the sofa, came in again too sharply and bumped it.</p>
<p>“Mme. Marah,” his mother said, “may I present my son?”</p>
<p>“Christ, he’s a big bastard, isn’t he?” the true friend said.</p>
<p>She was a fine one to talk about anybody’s being big. Had she risen,
she would have stood shoulder against shoulder with him, and she must
have outweighed him by sixty pounds. She was dressed in quantities of
tweedlike stuff ornamented, surprisingly, with black sequins set on in
patterns of little bunches of grapes. On her massive wrists were bands
and chains of dull silver, from some of which hung amulets of discolored
ivory, like rotted fangs. Over her head and neck was a sort of caul of
crisscrossed mauve veiling, splattered with fuzzy black balls. The caul
caused her no inconvenience. Puffs of smoke issued sporadically from
behind it, and, though the veiling was crisp elsewhere, around the mouth
it was of a marshy texture, where drink had passed through it.</p>
<p>His mother became the little girl again. “Isn’t he wonderful?” she
said. “This is my baby. This is Crissy-wiss.”</p>
<p>“What is his name?” the true friend said.</p>
<p>“Why, Christopher, of course,” his mother said.</p>
<p>Christopher, of course. Had he been born earlier, it would have been
Peter; earlier again, Michael; he had been not much too late for
Jonathan. In the lower forms of his school, there were various
Nicholases, several Robins, and here and there a Jeremy coming up. But
the members of his own class were in the main Christophers.</p>
<p>“Christopher,” the true friend said. “Well, that’s not too bad. Of
course, that downward stroke of the ‘p’ is bound to give him trouble,
and I’m never really happy about an ‘r’ and an ‘i’ together. But it’s
not too bad. Not too. When’s your birthday?” she asked the boy.</p>
<p>“The fifteenth of August,” he said.</p>
<p>His mother was no longer the little girl. “The heat,” she said, “the
cruel August heat. And the stitches. Oh, God, the stitches!”</p>
<p>“So he’s a Leo,” the true friend said. “Awfully big for a Leo. You
want to be pretty careful, young man, from October 22nd to November
13th. Keep away from anything electrical.”</p>
<p>“I will,” the boy said. “Thank you,” he added.</p>
<p>“Let me see your hand,” the true friend said.</p>
<p>The boy gave her his hand.</p>
<p>“Mm,” she said, scanning the palm. “M-hmm, m-hmm, m-hmm. Oh.
Well—that can’t be helped. Well, you’ll have pretty good health, if you
just watch that chest of yours. There’s a long sickness in your twenties
and a bad accident some time around forty-five, but that’s about all.
There’s going to be an unhappy love affair, but you’ll get over it.
You’ll marry and— I can’t see if there’s two or three children. Probably
two and one born dead, or something like that. I don’t see much money,
any time. Well, you watch your chest.” She gave him back his hand.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he said.</p>
<p>The little girl came back to his mother. “Isn’t he going to be
famous?” she said.</p>
<p>The true friend shrugged. “It’s not in his hand,” she said.</p>
<p>“I always thought he’d write,” his mother said. “When he was so small
you could hardly see him, he used to write little verses. Crissy, what
was the one about the bumpety bunny?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Mother!” he said. “I don’t remember!”</p>
<p>“Oh, you do so, too!” she said. “You’re just being modest. It was all
about how the bunny went bumpety, bumpety all day long. Of course you
remember. Well, you don’t seem to write verses any more—at least none
you show to me. And your letters—they’re like telegrams. When you write
at all, that is. Oh, Marah, why do they have to grow up? And now he’s
going to be married and have all those children.”</p>
<p>“Two, anyway,” the true friend said. “I’m not too happy about that
third one.”</p>
<p>“I suppose I’ll never see him then,” his mother said. “A lonely old
woman, sick and trembling, and no one to take care of me.”</p>
<p>She picked up the true friend’s empty glass from the coffee table,
filled it and her own from the cocktail shaker, and returned the
friend’s. She sat down near the sofa.</p>
<p>“Well, sit down, Crissy,” she said. “And why don’t you take off your
coat?”</p>
<p>“Why, I don’t think I’d better, Mom,” he said. “You see—”</p>
<p>“He wants to keep his wet coat on,” the true friend said. “He likes
to smell like low tide.”</p>
<p>“Well, you see,” the boy said, “I can stay just a minute. You see,
the train was late and everything, and I told Dad I’d be sure to be
there early.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” his mother said. The little girl ran off abruptly. The eyelids
came into play.</p>
<p>“It’s because the train was late,” he said. “If it had been on time,
I could have stayed awhile. But it had to go and be late, and they’re
having dinner awfully early tonight.”</p>
<p>“I see,” his mother said. “I see. I had thought that you would have
dinner with me. With your mother. Her only son. But no, that is not to
be. I have only an egg, but I would have shared it with you so gladly.
So happily. But you are wise, of course. You must think first of your
own comfort. Go and fill your stomach with your father. Go eat stalled
ox with him.”</p>
<p>“Mother, don’t you see?” he said. “We have to have dinner early
because we have to go to bed early. We’ve got to get up at daybreak
because we’re driving to the country. You know. I wrote you.”</p>
<p>“Driving?” she said. “Your father has a new car, I presume.”</p>
<p>“It’s the same old heap,” he said. “Nearly eight years old.”</p>
<p>“Really?” she said. “Naturally, the buses in which I am obliged to
ride are all this year’s models.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Mom,” he said.</p>
<p>“Is your father well?” she said.</p>
<p>“He’s fine,” he said.</p>
<p>“Why not?” she said. “What is there could pierce that heart? And how
is Mrs. Tennant? As I suppose she calls herself.”</p>
<p>“Let’s not do this again, will you, Mom?” he said. “She’s
Mrs. Tennant. You know that. She and Dad have been married for six
years.”</p>
<p>“To me,” she said, “there is only one woman who may rightfully wear a
man’s name; the one whose son he has sired. But that is only my humble
opinion. Who is to listen to it?”</p>
<p>“You get along all right with your stepmother?” the true friend
said.</p>
<p>As always, it took him a moment before he could connect the term. It
seemed to have nothing to do with Whitey, with her gay little monkey’s
face and her flying straw-colored hair.</p>
<p>A laugh fell from his mother’s lips, hard, like a pellet of ice.
“Such women are sly,” she said. “They have ways.”</p>
<p>“Well, born on a cusp,” the true friend said. “You’ve got to keep
considering that.”</p>
<p>His mother turned to the boy. “I am going to do something that you
will agree, in any honesty, that I have never done before,” she said. “I
am going to ask a favor of you. I am going to ask you to take off your
coat and sit down, so that for just a few poor minutes it will seem as
if you were not going to leave me. Will you let me have that illusion?
Do not do it out of affection or gratitude or consideration. Just in
simple pity.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sit down, for God’s sake,” the true friend said. “You make
people nervous.”</p>
<p>“All right, sure,” the boy said. He took off his raincoat, hung it
over his arm, and sat on a small, straight chair.</p>
<p>“He’s the biggest damn thing I ever saw,” the true friend said.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” his mother said. “If you think I ask too much, I plead
guilty. Mea culpa. Well, now that we are cozy, let us talk, shall we? I
see so little of you—I know so little about you. Tell me some things.
Tell me what there is about this Mrs. Tennant that causes you to rank
her so high above me. Is she more beautiful than I am?”</p>
<p>“Mom, please,” he said. “You know Whitey isn’t beautiful. She’s just
sort of funny-looking. Nice funny.”</p>
<p>“Nice funny,” she said. “Oh, I’m afraid I could never compete with
that. Well, looks aren’t everything, I suppose. Tell me, do you consider
her a human being?”</p>
<p>“Mother, I don’t know,” he said. “I can’t do that kind of talk.”</p>
<p>“Let it pass,” she said. “Let it be forgotten. Is your father’s
country place attractive at this time of year?”</p>
<p>“It isn’t a place,” he said. “You know—it’s just a big sort of shack.
There isn’t even any heat. Just fireplaces.”</p>
<p>“Ironic,” she said. “Bitterly, cruelly ironic. I, who so love an open
fire; I, who could sit all day looking into its leaping golds and
purples and dreaming happy dreams. And I haven’t even a gas log. Well.
And who is going to this shack, to share the lovely, glowing fires?”</p>
<p>“Just Dad and Whitey and me,” he said. “Oh, and the other Whitey, of
course.”</p>
<p>His mother looked at the true friend. “Is it growing dark in here?”
she said. “Or is it just that I think I am going to faint?” She looked
again at the boy. “The other Whitey?”</p>
<p>“It’s a little dog,” he said. “Not any particular kind. It’s a nice
little dog. Whitey saw it out in the street, when it was snowing, and it
followed her home, and so they kept it. And whenever Dad—whenever
anybody called Whitey, the dog would come, too. So Dad said well, if he
thought that was his name, then that was going to be his name. So that
was why.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid,” his mother said, “that your father is not aging with
dignity. To me, whimsey after forty-five is a matter of nausea.”</p>
<p>“It’s an awfully nice little dog,” he said.</p>
<p>“The management does not allow dogs here,” she said. “I suppose that
will be held against me. Marah—this drink. It is as weak as the beating
of my heart.”</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t he make us some fresh ones?” the true friend said.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” the boy said. “I don’t know how to make cocktails.”</p>
<p>“What do they teach you, anyway, in that fancy school of yours?” the
true friend said.</p>
<p>His mother tilted her head at the boy. “Crissy,” she said, “want to
be a big, brave man? Take the bowl and get some nice, cold ice out of
the kitchen.”</p>
<p>He took the ice bowl, went into the minuscule kitchen, and took a
tray of ice cubes from the tiny refrigerator. When he replaced the tray,
he could hardly close the refrigerator door, the shelves were so
crowded. There were a cardboard box of eggs, a packet of butter, a
cluster of glossy French rolls, three artichokes, two avocados, a plate
of tomatoes, a bowl of shelled peas, a grapefruit, a tin of vegetable
juices, a glass of red caviar, a cream cheese, an assortment of sliced
Italian sausages, and a plump little roasted Cornish Rock hen.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>When he returned, his mother was busied with bottles and shaker. He
set the bowl of cubes beside them.</p>
<p>“Look, Mom,” he said, “honestly I’ve got to—”</p>
<p>His mother looked at him and her lip trembled. “Just two more
minutes,” she whispered. “Please, oh, please.”</p>
<p>He went and sat again.</p>
<p>She made the drinks, gave one to the true friend, and kept one. She
sank into her chair; her head drooped and her body looked as boneless as
a skein of yarn.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want a drink?” the true friend said.</p>
<p>“No, thanks,” the boy said.</p>
<p>“Might do you good,” the true friend said. “Might stunt your growth.
How long are you going to stay up in this country where you’re
going?”</p>
<p>“Oh, just over tomorrow night,” he said. “I have to be back at school
Sunday evening.”</p>
<p>His mother stiffened and straightened. Her former coldnesses were as
tropical heat to that which took her now.</p>
<p>“Do I understand you to say that you will not be coming in to see me
again?” she said. “Do I understand you aright?”</p>
<p>“I can’t, Mom,” he said. “I won’t have a chance. We’ve got to drive
back, and then I have to get the train.”</p>
<p>“I quite comprehend,” she said. “I had thought, in my tenderness, I
would see you again before your return to your school. I had thought, of
course, that if you must rush away like a mad thing today, then I would
see you again, to make up for it. Disappointments—I thought I had had
them all, I thought life could bring forth no new ones. But this—this.
That you will not take a little bit of your time from your relatives,
who have so much of it, to give to me, your mother. How it must please
them that you do not want to see me. How they must laugh together. What
a triumph. How they must howl in merriment.”</p>
<p>“Mother, don’t say things like that,” he said. “You shouldn’t, even
when you’re—”</p>
<p>“Please!” she said. “The subject is closed. I will say no more about
your father, poor, weak man, and that woman with the dog’s name. But
you—you. Have you no heart, no bowels, no natural instincts? No. You
have not. I must face the fact. Here, in the presence of my friend, I
must say what I had thought never, never to say. My son is not a human
being!”</p>
<p>The true friend shook her caul and sighed. The boy sat still.</p>
<p>“Your father,” his mother said. “Does he still see his old friends?
Our old friends?”</p>
<p>“Why, I don’t know, Mom,” he said. “Yes, they see a lot of people, I
guess. There’s almost always somebody there. But they’re alone a lot of
the time. They like it that way.”</p>
<p>“How fortunate,” she said. “They like being alone. Smug, content, no
need— Yes. And the old friends. They do not see me. They are all in
twos, they have lives, they know what they’re going to be doing six
months from now. Why should they see me? Why should they have memories,
kindnesses?”</p>
<p>“Probably most of them Pisces,” the true friend said.</p>
<p>“Well, you must go,” the boy’s mother said. “It is late. Late—when is
it ever late for me, when my son is with me? But you have told me. I
know. I understand, and so I bow my head. Go, Christopher. Go.”</p>
<p>“I’m terribly sorry, Mom,” the boy said. “But I told you how it is.”
He rose and put on his coat.</p>
<p>“Christ, he gets bigger and bigger,” the true friend said.</p>
<p>This time, the eyelids of the boy’s mother were lowered at her
friend. “I have always admired tall men,” she said. She turned again to
the boy. “You must go,” she said. “It is so written. But take happiness
with you. Take sweet memories of our little time together. See—I shall
show you that I bear no vengefulness. I shall show you that I wish only
well to those who have wrought but evil to me. I shall give you a
present to take one of them.”</p>
<p>She rose, moved about the room, touched boxes and tables fruitlessly.
Then she went to the desk, moved papers and inkstands, and brought forth
a small, square box, on top of which was a little plaster poodle,
sitting on its hind legs, its front paws curved endearingly,
begging.</p>
<p>“This is a souvenir of happier times,” she said. “But I need no
reminders. Take this dear, happy thing to one you love. See! See what it
is!”</p>
<p>She touched a spring at the back of the box and the “Marseillaise”
tinkled forth, hesitantly.</p>
<p>“My little music box,” she said. “That moonlit night, the ship so
brilliant, the ocean so still and beckoning.”</p>
<p>“Hey, that’s cool, Mom,” he said. “Thanks ever so much. Whitey’ll
love it. She loves things like that.”</p>
<p>“Things like that?” she said. “There are no other things like that,
when one gives from one’s heart.” She stopped and seemed to ponder.
“Whitey will love it?” she said. “Are you telling me that you propose
giving it to that so-called Mrs. Tennant?” She touched the box; the
tinkling ceased.</p>
<p>“I thought you said—” the boy said.</p>
<p>She shook her head at him, slowly. “Curious,” she said.
“Extraordinary. That my son should have so little perception. This gift,
from my poor little store, is not for her. It is for the little dog. The
little dog that I may not have.”</p>
<p>“Why, thanks, Mom,” he said. “Thanks.”</p>
<p>“So go,” she said. “I would not hold you. Take with you my wishes for
your joy, among your loved ones. And when you can, when they will
release you for a little while—come to me again. I wait for you. I light
a lamp for you. My son, my only child, there are but desert sands for me
between your comings. I live on your visits—Chris, I live on your
visits.”</p>
