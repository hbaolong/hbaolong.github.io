<h4 id="seven">Seven</h4>
<p>By Edwidge Danticat (2001)</p>
<p>Next month would make it seven years since he’d last seen his wife.
Seven, a number he despised but had discovered was a useful marker.
There were seven days between paychecks, seven hours, not counting
lunch, spent each day at his day job, seven at his night job. Seven was
the last number in his age—thirty-seven. And now there were seven hours
left before his wife was due to arrive. Maybe it would be more, with her
having to wait for her luggage and then make it through the long
immigration line and past cus-toms to look for him in the crowd of
welcoming faces on the other side of the sliding doors at J.F.K. That
is, if the flight from Port-au-Prince wasn’t delayed, as it often was,
or cancelled altogether.</p>
<p>He shared an apartment in the basement of a house in East Flatbush,
Brooklyn, with two other men. To prepare for the reunion, he had cleaned
his room. He had thrown out some cherry-red rayon shirts that he knew
she would hate. And then he had climbed the splintered steps to the
first floor to tell the landlady that his wife was coming. His landlady
was also Haitian, a self-employed accountant. “I don’t have a problem
with your wife coming,” she had told him. She was microwaving a frozen
dessert. “I just hope she is clean.”</p>
<p>“She is clean,” he said.</p>
<p>The kitchen was the only room in the main part of the house that he’d
ever seen. It was spotless, and the dishes were neatly organized in
glass cabinets. It smelled of pine-scented air freshener.</p>
<p>“Did you tell the men?” she asked. She opened the microwave and
removed two small plastic plates of something that vaguely resembled
strawberry cheesecake.</p>
<p>“I told them,” he said.</p>
<p>He was waiting for her to announce that she would have to charge him
extra. She had agreed to rent the room to one person, not two—a man
she’d probably taken for a bachelor.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I can keep this arrangement if everyone’s wife
starts coming,” she said.</p>
<p>He could not speak for the two other men. Michel and Dany had wives,
too, but he had no idea if or when those wives would be joining
them.</p>
<p>“A woman living down there with three men,” the landlady said. “Maybe
your wife will be uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>He wanted to tell her that it was not up to her to decide whether or
not his wife would be comfortable. But he had been prepared for this,
too, for some unpleasant remark about his wife. Actually, he was up
there as much to give notice that he was looking for an apartment as to
announce that his wife was coming. As soon as he found one, he would be
moving.</p>
<p>“O.K., then,” she said, opening her silverware drawer. “Just
remember, you start the month, you pay the whole thing.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, Madame,” he said.</p>
<p>As he walked back downstairs, he scolded himself for calling her
Madame. Why had he acted like a servant who had been dismissed? It was
one of those class things from home that he couldn’t shake. On the other
hand, if he had addressed the woman respectfully, it wasn’t because she
was so-called upper class, or because she spoke French (though never to
him), or even because after five years in the same room he was still
paying only three hundred and fifty dollars a month. If he had addressed
the woman politely that day, it was because he was making a sacrifice
for his wife.</p>
<p>After his conversation with the landlady, he decided to have a more
thorough one with the men who occupied the other two rooms in the
basement. The day before his wife was to arrive, he went into the
kitchen to see them. The fact that they were wearing only white, rather
sheer, loose boxers, as they stumbled about bleary-eyed, concerned
him.</p>
<p>“You understand, she’s a woman,” he told them. He wasn’t worried that
she’d be tempted—they were skin and bones—but if she was still as
sensitive as he remembered, their near-nakedness might embarrass
her.</p>
<p>The men understood.</p>
<p>“If it were my wife,” Michel said, “I would feel the same.”</p>
<p>Dany simply nodded.</p>
<p>They had robes, Michel declared after a while. They would wear
them.</p>
<p>They didn’t have robes—all three men knew this—but Michel would buy
some, out of respect for the wife. Michel, at forty, the oldest of the
three, had advised him to pretty up his room—to buy some silk roses,
some decorative prints for the walls (no naked girls), and some vanilla
incense, which would be more pleasing than the air fresheners the woman
upstairs liked so much.</p>
<p>Dany told him that he would miss their evenings out together. In the
old days, they had often gone dancing at the Rendez-Vous, which was now
the Cenegal night club. But they hadn’t gone much since the place had
become famous—Abner Louima was arrested there, then beaten and sodomized
at a nearby police station.</p>
<p>He told Dany not to mention those nights out again. His wife wasn’t
to know that he had ever done anything but work his jobs—as a day
janitor at Medgar Evers College and as a night janitor at King’s County
Hospital. And he wasn’t going to tell her about those women who had
occasionally come home with him in the early-morning hours. Those women,
most of whom had husbands, boyfriends, fiancés, and lovers in other
parts of the world, had never meant much to him anyway.</p>
<p>Michel, who had become a lay minister at a small Baptist church near
the Rendez-Vous and never danced there, laughed as he listened. “The
cock can no longer crow,” he said. “You might as well give the rest to
Jesus.”</p>
<p>“Jesus wouldn’t know what to do with what’s left of this man,” Dany
said.</p>
<p>Gone were the late-night domino games. Gone was the phone number he’d
had for the past five years, ever since he’d had a phone. (He didn’t
need other women calling him now.) And it was only as he stood in the
crowd of people waiting to meet the flights arriving simultaneously from
Kingston, Santo Domingo, and Port-au-Prince that he stopped worrying
that he might not see any delight or recognition in his wife’s face.
There, he began to feel some actual joy, even exhilaration, which made
him want to leap forward and grab every woman who vaguely resembled the
latest pictures she had sent him, all of which he had neatly framed and
hung on the walls of his room.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>They were searching her suitcase. Why were they searching her
suitcase? One meagre bag, which, aside from some gifts for her husband,
contained the few things she’d been unable to part with, the things her
relatives hadn’t nabbed from her, telling her that she could get more,
and better, where she was going. She had kept only her undergarments, a
nightgown, and two outfits: the green princess dress she was wearing and
a red jumper that she’d gift wrapped before packing so that no one would
take it. People in her neighborhood who had travelled before had told
her to gift wrap everything so that it wouldn’t be opened at the airport
in New York. Now the customs man was tearing her careful wrapping to
shreds as he barked questions at her in mangled Creole.</p>
<p>“Ki sa l ye?” He held a package out in front of her before opening
it.</p>
<p>What was it? She didn’t know anymore. She could only guess by the
shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>He unwrapped all her gifts—the mangoes, sugarcane, avocados, the
orange- and grapefruit-peel preserves, the peanut, cashew, and coconut
confections, the coffee beans, which he threw into a green bin decorated
with drawings of fruits and vegetables with red lines across them. The
only thing that seemed as though it might escape disposal was a small
packet of trimmed chicken feathers, which her husband used to enjoy
twirling in his ear cavity. In the early days, soon after he’d left, she
had spun the tips of the feathers inside her ears, too, and discovered
that from them she could get jwisans, pleasure, an orgasm. She had
thought to herself then that maybe the foreign television programs were
right: sex was mostly between the ears.</p>
<p>When the customs man came across the small package of feathers, he
stared down at it, then looked up at her, letting his eyes linger on her
face, mostly, it seemed to her, on her ears. Obviously, he had seen
feathers like these before. Into the trash they went, along with the
rest of her offerings.</p>
<p>By the time he was done with her luggage, she had little left. The
suitcase was so light now that she could walk very quickly as she
carried it in her left hand. She followed a man pushing a cart, which
tipped and swerved under the weight of three large boxes. And suddenly
she found herself before a door that slid open by itself, parting like a
glass sea, and as she was standing there the door closed again, and when
she moved a few steps forward it opened, and then she saw him. He
charged at her and wrapped both his arms around her. And as he held her
she felt her feet leave the ground. It was when he put her back down
that she finally believed she was really somewhere else, on another
soil, in another country.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>He could tell she was happy that so many of her pictures were
displayed on the wall facing his bed. During the ride home, he had
nearly crashed the car twice. He wasn’t sure why he was driving so fast.
They dashed through the small talk, the inventory of friends and family
members and the state of their health. She had no detailed anecdotes
about anyone in particular. Some had died and some were still living; he
couldn’t even remember which. She was bigger than she had been when he
left her, what people here might call chubby. It was obvious that she
had been to a professional hairdresser, because she was elegantly
coiffed with her short hair gelled down to her scalp and a fake bun
bulging in the back. She smelled good—a mixture of lavender and lime. He
had simply wanted to get her home, if home it was, to that room, and to
reduce the space between them until there was no air for her to breathe
that he wasn’t breathing, too.</p>
<p>The drive had reminded him of the one they had taken to their
one-night honeymoon at the Ifé Hotel, when he had begged the uncle who
was driving them to go faster, because the next morning he would be on a
plane for New York. That night, he’d had no idea that it would be seven
years before he would see her again. He’d had it all planned. He knew
that he couldn’t send for her right away, since he would be overstaying
a tourist visa. But he was going to work hard, to find a lawyer and get
himself a green card, and then send for his wife. The green card had
taken six years and nine months. But now she was here with him, staring
at the pictures on his wall as though they were of someone else.</p>
<p>“Do you remember that one?” he asked, to reassure her. He was
pointing at a framed eight-by-twelve of her lying on a red mat by a tiny
Christmas tree in a photographer’s studio. “You sent it last Noël?”</p>
<p>She remembered, she said. It was just that she looked so desperate,
as if she were trying to force him to remember her.</p>
<p>“I never forgot you for an instant,” he said.</p>
<p>She said that she was thirsty.</p>
<p>“What do you want to drink?” He listed the juices he had purchased
from the Cuban grocer down the street, the combinations he was sure
she’d be craving, papaya and mango, guava and pineapple, cherimoya and
passion fruit.</p>
<p>“Just a little water,” she said. “Cold.”</p>
<p>He didn’t want to leave her alone while he went to the kitchen. He
would have called through the walls for one of the men to get some
water, if they were not doing such a good job of hiding behind the
closed doors of their rooms to give him some privacy.</p>
<p>When he came back with the glass, she examined it, as if for dirt,
and then gulped it down. It was as though she hadn’t drunk anything
since the morning he’d got on the plane and left her behind.</p>
<p>“Do you want more?” he asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>It’s too bad, he thought, that in Creole the word for love, renmen,
is also the word for like, so that as he told her he loved her he had to
embellish it with phrases that illustrated the degree of that love. He
loved her more than there were seconds in the years they’d been apart,
he babbled. He loved her more than the size of the ocean she had just
crossed. To keep himself from saying more insipid things, he jumped on
top of her and pinned her down on the bed. She was not as timid as she
had been on their wedding night. She tugged at his black tie so fiercely
that he was sure his neck was bruised. He yanked a few buttons off her
dress and threw them aside as she unbuttoned his starched and ironed
white shirt, and though in the rehearsals in past daydreams he had
gently placed a cupped hand over her mouth, he didn’t think to do it
now. He didn’t care that the other men could hear her, or him. Only for
a moment did he think to feel sorry that it might be years before the
others could experience the same thing.</p>
<p>He was exhausted when she grabbed the top sheet from the bed, wrapped
it around her, and announced that she was going to the bathroom.</p>
<p>“Let me take you,” he said.</p>
<p>“Non non,” she said. “I can find it.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t stand to watch her turn away and disappear.</p>
<p>He heard voices in the kitchen, her talking to the men, introducing
herself. He bolted right up from the bed when he remembered that all she
had on was the sheet. As he raced to the door, he collided with her
coming back.</p>
<p>There were two men playing dominoes in the kitchen, she told him,
dressed in identical pink satin robes.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>He left early for work the next day, along with the other men, but
not before handing her a set of keys and instructing her not to let
anyone in. He showed her how to work the stove and how to find all the
Haitian stations on the AM/FM dial of his night-table radio. She slept
late, reliving the night, their laughter after she’d seen the men, who,
he explained, had hurried to buy those robes for her benefit. They had
made love again and again, forcing themselves to do so more quietly each
time. Seven times, by his count—once for each year they’d been apart—but
fewer by hers. He had assured her that there was no need to be
embarrassed. They were married, before God and a priest. This was
crucial for her to remember. That’s why he had seen to it on the night
before he left. So that something more judicial and committing than a
mere promise would bind them. So that even if their union had become a
victim of distance and time, it could not have been easily dissolved.
They would have had to sign papers to come apart, write letters, speak
on the phone about it. He told her that he didn’t want to leave her
again, not for one second. But he had asked for the day off and his boss
had refused. At least they would have the weekends, Saturdays and
Sundays, to do with as they wished—to go dancing, sightseeing, shopping,
and apartment-hunting. Wouldn’t she like to have her own apartment? To
make love as much as they wanted and not worry that some men in women’s
robes had heard them?</p>
<p>At noon, the phone rang. It was him. He asked her what she was doing.
She lied and told him that she was cooking, making herself something to
eat. He asked what. She said eggs, guessing that there must be eggs in
the refrigerator. He asked if she was bored. She said no. She was going
to listen to the radio and write letters home.</p>
<p>When she hung up, she turned on the radio. She scrolled between the
stations he had pointed out to her and was glad to hear people speaking
Creole. There was music playing, too—konpa by a group named Top Vice.
She switched to a station with a talk show. She sat up to listen as some
callers talked about a Haitian-American named Patrick Dorismond who had
been killed. He had been shot by a policeman in a place called
Manhattan. She wanted to call her husband back, but he hadn’t left a
number. Lying back, she raised the sheet over her head and through it
listened to the callers, each one angrier than the last.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>When he came home, he saw that she had used what she had found in the
refrigerator and the kitchen cabinets to cook a large meal for all four
of them. She insisted that they wait for the other men to drift in
before they ate, even though he had only a few hours before he had to
leave for his night job.</p>
<p>The men complimented her enthusiastically on her cooking, and he
could tell that this meal made them feel as though they were part of a
family, something they had not experienced in years. They seemed to be
happy, eating for pleasure as well as sustenance, chewing more slowly
than they ever had before. Usually they ate standing up, Chinese or
Jamaican takeout from places down the street. Tonight there was little
conversation, beyond praise for the food. The men offered to clean the
pots and dishes once they were done, and he suspected that they wanted
to lick them before washing them.</p>
<p>He and his wife went to the room and lay on their backs on the bed.
He explained why he had two jobs. It had been partly to fill the hours
away from her, but also partly because he had needed to support both
himself here and her in Port-au-Prince. And now he was saving up for an
apartment and, ultimately, a house. She said that she, too, wanted to
work. She had finished a secretarial course; perhaps that would be
helpful here. He warned her that, because she didn’t speak English, she
might have to start as a cook in a restaurant or as a seamstress in a
factory. He fell asleep mid-thought. She woke him up at nine o’clock,
when he was supposed to start work. He rushed to the bathroom to wash
his face, came back, and changed his overalls, all the while cursing
himself. He was stupid to have overslept, and now he was late. He kissed
her goodbye and ran out. He hated being late, being lectured by the
night manager, whose favorite reprimand was “There’s tons of people like
you in this city. Half of them need a job.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>She spent the whole week inside, worried that she’d get lost if she
ventured out alone, that she might not be able to retrace her steps. Her
days fell into a routine. She’d wake up and listen to the radio for news
of what was happening both here and back home. Somewhere, not far from
where she was, people were in the streets, marching, protesting
Dorismond’s death, their outrage made even greater by the fact that the
Dorismond boy was the American-born son of a well-known singer, whose
voice they had heard on the radio back in Haiti. “No justice, no peace!”
she chanted while stewing chicken and frying fish. In the afternoons,
she wrote letters home. She wrote of the meals that she had made, of the
pictures of her on the wall, of the songs and protest chants on the
radio. She wrote to family members, and to childhood girlfriends who had
been so happy that she was finally going to be with her husband, and to
newer acquaintances from the secretarial school who had been jealous.
She also wrote to a male friend, a neighbor who had come to her house
three days after her husband had left to see why she had locked herself
inside.</p>
<p>He had knocked for so long that she’d had no choice but to open the
door. She was still wearing the dress she’d worn to see her husband off.
When she collapsed in his arms, he had put a cold compress on her
forehead and offered her some water. She had swallowed so much water so
quickly that she’d vomited. That night, he had lain down next to her,
and in the dark had told her that this was love, if love there
was—having the courage to abandon the present for a future that one
could only imagine. He had assured her that her husband loved her.</p>
<p>In the afternoons, while she was writing her letters, she would hear
someone walking back and forth on the floor above. She took to pacing as
well, as she waited for the men to come home. She wanted to tell her
husband about that neighbor who had slept next to her for those days
after he’d left and in whose bed she had spent many nights after that.
Only then would she feel that their future would be true. Someone had
said that people lie only at the beginning of relationships. The middle
is where the truth resides. But there had been no middle for her husband
and herself, just a beginning and many dream-rehearsed endings.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>He had first met his wife during carnival in the mountains in Jacmel.
His favorite part of the festivities was the finale, on the day before
Ash Wednesday, when a crowd of tired revellers would gather on the beach
to burn their carnival masks and costumes and feign weeping,
symbolically purging themselves of the carousing of the preceding days
and nights. She had volunteered to be one of the official weepers—one of
those who wailed convincingly as the carnival relics turned to ashes in
the bonfire.</p>
<p>“Papa Kanaval ou ale?” “Where have you gone, Father Carnival?” she
had howled, with real tears running down her face.</p>
<p>If she could grieve so passionately on demand, he thought, perhaps
she could love even more. After the other weepers had left, she stayed
behind until the last embers of the bonfire had dimmed. It was
impossible to distract her, to make her laugh. She could never fake
weeping, she told him. Every time she cried for anything, she cried for
everything else that had ever hurt her.</p>
<p>He had travelled between Jacmel and Port-au-Prince while he was
waiting for his visa to come through. And when he finally had a travel
date he had asked her to marry him.</p>
<p>One afternoon, when he came home from work, he found her sitting on
the edge of the bed in that small room, staring at the pictures of
herself on the opposite wall. She did not move as he kissed the top of
her head. He said nothing, simply slipped out of his clothes and lay
down on the bed, pressing his face against her back. He did not want to
trespass on her secrets. He simply wanted to extinguish the carnivals
burning in her head.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>She was happy when the weekend finally came. Though he slept until
noon, she woke up at dawn, rushed to the bathroom before the men could,
put on her red jumper and one of his T-shirts, then sat staring down at
him on the bed, waiting for his eyes to open.</p>
<p>“What plan do we have for today?” she asked when they finally
did.</p>
<p>The plan, he said, was whatever she wanted.</p>
<p>She wanted to walk down a street with him and see faces. She wanted
to eat something, an apple or a chicken leg, out in the open with the
sun beating down on her face.</p>
<p>As they were leaving the house, they ran into the woman whose
footsteps she had been hearing all week long above her head. The woman
smiled coyly and said, “Bienvenue.” She nodded politely, then pulled her
husband away by the hand.</p>
<p>They walked down a street filled with people doing their Saturday
food shopping at outside stalls stacked with fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>He asked if she wanted to take the bus.</p>
<p>“Where to?”</p>
<p>“Anywhere,” he said.</p>
<p>From the bus, she counted the frame and row houses, beauty-shop
signs, church steeples, and gas stations. She pressed her face against
the window, and her breath occasionally blocked her view of the streets
speeding by. She turned back now and then to look at him, sitting next
to her. There was still a trace of sleepiness in his eyes. He watched
her as though he were trying to put himself in her place, to see it all
as if for the first time, but could not.</p>
<p>He took her to a park in the middle of Brooklyn, Prospect Park, a
vast stretch of land, trees, and trails. They strolled deep into the
park, until they could see only a few of the surrounding buildings,
which towered like mountains above the landscape. In all her daydreams,
she had never imagined that there would be a place like this here. This
immense garden, he told her, was where he came to ponder the passing
seasons, lost time, and interminable distances.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>It was past seven o’clock when they emerged from the park and headed
down Parkside Avenue. She had reached for his hand at 5:10 p.m., he had
noted, and had not released it since. And now, as they were walking down
a dimly lit side street, she kept her eyes upward, looking into the
windows of apartments lit by the indigo glow of television screens. When
she said she was hungry, they turned onto Flatbush Avenue in search of
something to eat.</p>
<p>Walking hand in hand with her through crowds of strangers made him
long for his other favorite piece of carnival theatre. A bride and
groom, in their most lavish wedding clothing, would wander the streets.
Scanning a crowd of revellers, they would pick the most stony-faced
person and ask, “Would you marry us?” Over the course of several days,
for variety, they would modify this request. “Would you couple us?”
“Would you make us one?” “Would you tie the noose of love around our
necks?” The joke was that when the person took the bait and looked
closely, he or she might discover that the bride was a man and the groom
a woman. The couple’s makeup was so skillfully applied that only the
most observant could detect this.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>On the nearly empty bus on the way home, he sat across the aisle from
her, not next to her as he had that morning. She pretended to keep her
eyes on the night racing past the window behind him. He was watching her
again. This time he seemed to be trying to see her as if for the first
time, but could not.</p>
<p>She, too, was thinking of carnival, and of how, the year after they’d
met, they had dressed as a bride and groom looking for someone to marry
them. She had disguised herself as the bride and he as the groom,
forgoing the traditional puzzle.</p>
<p>At the end of the celebrations, she had burned her wedding dress in
the bonfire and he had burned his suit. She wished now that they had
kept them. They could have walked these foreign streets in them,
performing their own carnival. Since she didn’t know the language, they
wouldn’t have to speak or ask any questions of the stony-faced people
around them. They could perform their public wedding march in silence, a
silence like the one that had come over them now.</p>
