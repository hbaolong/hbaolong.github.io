<h4 id="the-burning-house">The Burning House</h4>
<p>By Ann Beattie (1979)</p>
<p>Freddy Fox is in the kitchen with me. He has just washed and dried an
avocado seed I don’t want, and he is leaning against the wall, rolling a
joint. In five minutes, I will not be able to count on him. However: he
started late in the day, and he has already brought in wood for the
fire, gone to the store down the road for matches, and set the table.
“You mean you’d know this stuff was Limoges even if you didn’t turn the
plate over?” he called from the dining room. He pretended to be about to
throw one of the plates into the kitchen, like a Frisbee. Sam, the dog,
believed him and shot up, kicking the rug out behind him and skidding
forward before he realized his error; it was like the Road Runner
tricking Wile E. Coyote into going over the cliff for the millionth
time. His jowls sank in disappointment.</p>
<p>“I see there’s a full moon,” Freddy says. “There’s just nothing that
can hold a candle to nature. The moon and the stars, the tides and the
sunshine—and we just don’t stop for long enough to wonder at it all.
We’re so engrossed in ourselves.” He takes a very long drag on the
joint. “We stand and stir the sauce in the pot instead of going to the
window and gazing at the moon.”</p>
<p>“You don’t mean anything personal by that, I assume.”</p>
<p>“I love the way you pour cream in a pan. I like to come up behind you
and watch the sauce bubble.”</p>
<p>“No, thank you,” I say. “You’re starting late in the day.”</p>
<p>“My responsibilities have ended. You don’t trust me to help with the
cooking, and I’ve already brought in firewood and run an errand, and
this very morning I exhausted myself by taking Mr. Sam jogging with me,
down at Putnam Park. You’re sure you won’t?”</p>
<p>“No, thanks,” I say. “Not now, anyway.”</p>
<p>“I love it when you stand over the steam coming out of a pan and the
hairs around your forehead curl into damp little curls.”</p>
<p>My husband, Frank Wayne, is Freddy’s half brother. Frank is an
accountant. Freddy is closer to me than to Frank. Since Frank talks to
Freddy more than he talks to me, however, and since Freddy is totally
loyal, Freddy always knows more than I know. It pleases me that he does
not know how to stir sauce; he will start talking, his mind will drift,
and when next you look the sauce will be lumpy, or boiling away.</p>
<p>Freddy’s criticism of Frank is only implied. “What a gracious gesture
to entertain his friends on the weekend,” he says.</p>
<p>“Male friends,” I say.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean that you’re the sort of lady who doesn’t draw the
line. I most certainly did not mean that,” Freddy says. “I would even
have been surprised if you had taken a toke of this deadly stuff while
you were at the stove.”</p>
<p>“O.K.,” I say, and take the joint from him. Half of it is left when I
take it. Half an inch is left after I’ve taken two drags and given it
back.</p>
<p>“More surprised still if you’d shaken the ashes into the
saucepan.”</p>
<p>“You’d tell people I’d done it when they’d finished eating, and I’d
be embarrassed. You can do it, though. I wouldn’t be embarrassed if it
was a story you told on yourself.”</p>
<p>“You really understand me,” Freddy says. “It’s moon-madness, but I
have to shake just this little bit in the sauce. I have to do it.”</p>
<p>He does it.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Frank and Tucker are in the living room. Just a few minutes ago,
Frank returned from getting Tucker at the train. Tucker loves to visit.
To him, Fairfield County is as mysterious as Alaska. He brought with him
from New York a crock of mustard, a jeroboam of champagne, cocktail
napkins with a picture of a plane flying over a building on them, twenty
egret feathers (“You cannot get them anymore—strictly illegal,” Tucker
whispered to me), and, under his black cowboy hat with the
rhinestone-studded chin strap, a toy frog that hopped when wound. Tucker
owns a gallery in SoHo, and Frank keeps his books. Tucker is now
stretched out in the living room, visiting with Frank, and Freddy and I
are both listening.</p>
<p>“…so everything I’ve been told indicates that he lives a purely
Jekyll-and-Hyde existence. He’s twenty years old, and I can see that
since he’s still living at home he might not want to flaunt his gayness.
When he came into the gallery, he had his hair slicked back—just with
water; I got close enough to sniff—and his mother was all but holding
his hand. So fresh scrubbed. The stories I’d heard. Anyway, when I
called, his father started looking for the number where he could be
reached on the Vineyard—very irritated, because I didn’t know James, and
if I’d just phoned James I could have found him in a flash. He’s talking
to himself, looking for the number, and I say, ‘Oh, did he go to visit
friends or—’ and his father interrupts and says, ‘He was going to a gay
pig roast. He’s been gone since Monday.’ Just like that.”</p>
<p>Freddy helps me carry the food out to the table. When we are all at
the table, I mention the young artist Tucker was talking about. “Frank
says his paintings are really incredible,” I say to Tucker.</p>
<p>“Makes Estes look like an Abstract Expressionist,” Tucker says. “I
want that boy. I really want that boy.”</p>
<p>“You’ll get him,” Frank says. “You get everybody you go after.”</p>
<p>Tucker cuts a small piece of meat. He cuts it small so that he can
talk while chewing. “Do I?” he says.</p>
<p>Freddy is smoking at the table, gazing dazedly at the moon centered
in the window. “After dinner,” he says, putting the back of his hand
against his forehead when he sees that I am looking at him, “we must all
go to the lighthouse.”</p>
<p>“If only you painted,” Tucker says. “I’d want you.”</p>
<p>“You couldn’t have me,” Freddy snaps. He reconsiders. “That sounded
halfhearted, didn’t it? Anybody who wants me can have me. This is the
only place I can be on Saturday night where somebody isn’t hustling
me.”</p>
<p>“Wear looser pants,” Frank says to Freddy.</p>
<p>“This is so much better than some bar that stinks of cigarette smoke
and leather. Why do I do it?” Freddy says. “Seriously—do you think I’ll
ever stop?”</p>
<p>“Let’s not be serious,” Tucker says.</p>
<p>“I keep thinking of this table as a big boat, with dishes and glasses
rocking on it,” Freddy says.</p>
<p>He takes the bone from his plate and walks out to the kitchen,
dripping sauce on the floor. He walks as though he’s on the deck of a
wave-tossed ship. “Mr. Sam!” he calls, and the dog springs up from the
living-room floor, where he had been sleeping; his toenails on the bare
wood floor sound like a wheel spinning in gravel. “You don’t have to
beg,” Freddy says. “Jesus, Sammy—I’m just giving it to you.”</p>
<p>“I hope there’s a bone involved,” Tucker says, rolling his eyes to
Frank. He cuts another tiny piece of meat. “I hope your brother does
understand why I couldn’t keep him on. He was good at what he did, but
he also might say just anything to a customer. You have to believe me
that if I hadn’t been extremely embarrassed more than once I never would
have let him go.”</p>
<p>“He should have finished school,” Frank says, sopping up sauce on his
bread. “He’ll knock around a while longer, then get tired of it and
settle down to something.”</p>
<p>“You think I died out here?” Freddy calls. “You think I can’t hear
you?”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying anything I wouldn’t say to your face,” Frank
says.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what I wouldn’t say to your face,” Freddy says.
“You’ve got a swell wife and kid and dog, and you’re a snob, and you
take it all for granted.”</p>
<p>Frank puts down his fork, completely exasperated. He looks at me.</p>
<p>“He came to work once this stoned,” Tucker says.
“Comprenez-vous?”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>“You like me because you feel sorry for me,” Freddy says.</p>
<p>He is sitting on the concrete bench outdoors, in the area that’s a
garden in the springtime. It is early April now—not quite spring. It’s
very foggy out. It rained while we were eating, and now it has turned
mild. I’m leaning against a tree, across from him, glad it’s so dark and
misty that I can’t look down and see the damage the mud is doing to my
boots.</p>
<p>“Who’s his girlfriend?” Freddy says.</p>
<p>“If I told you her name, you’d tell him I told you.”</p>
<p>“Slow down. What?”</p>
<p>“I won’t tell you, because you’ll tell him that I know.”</p>
<p>“He knows you know.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“How did you find out?”</p>
<p>“He talked about her. I kept hearing her name for months, and then we
went to a party at Andy’s, and she was there, and when I said something
about her later he said, ‘Natalie who?’ It was much too casual. It gave
the whole thing away.”</p>
<p>He sighs. “I just did something very optimistic,” he says. “I came
out here with Mr. Sam and he dug up a rock and I put the avocado seed in
the hole and packed dirt on top of it. Don’t say it—I know: can’t grow
outside, we’ll still have another snow, even if it grew, the next year’s
frost would kill it.”</p>
<p>“He’s embarrassed,” I say. “When he’s home, he avoids me. But it’s
rotten to avoid Mark, too. Six years old, and he calls up his friend
Neal to hint that he wants to go over there. He doesn’t do that when
we’re here alone.”</p>
<p>Freddy picks up a stick and pokes around in the mud with it. “I’ll
bet Tucker’s after that painter personally, not because he’s the hottest
thing since pancakes. That expression of his—it’s always the same. Maybe
Nixon really loved his mother, but with that expression who could
believe him? It’s a curse to have a face that won’t express what you
mean.”</p>
<p>“Amy!” Tucker calls. “Telephone.”</p>
<p>Freddy waves goodbye to me with the muddy stick. “ ‘I am not a
crook,’ ” Freddy says. “Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>Sam bounds halfway toward the house with me, then turns and goes back
to Freddy.</p>
<p>It’s Marilyn, Neal’s mother, on the phone.</p>
<p>“Hi,” Marilyn says. “He’s afraid to spend the night.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” I say. “He said he wouldn’t be.”</p>
<p>She lowers her voice. “We can try it out, but I think he’ll start
crying.”</p>
<p>“I’ll come get him.”</p>
<p>“I can bring him home. You’re having a dinner party, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>I lower my voice. “Some party. Tucker’s here. J.D. never showed
up.”</p>
<p>“Well,” she says. “I’m sure that what you cooked was good.”</p>
<p>“It’s so foggy out, Marilyn. I’ll come get Mark.”</p>
<p>“He can stay. I’ll be a martyr,” she says, and hangs up before I can
object.</p>
<p>Freddy comes into the house, tracking in mud. Sam lies in the
kitchen, waiting for his paws to be cleaned. “Come on,” Freddy says,
hitting his hand against his thigh, having no idea what Sam is doing.
Sam gets up and runs after him. They go into the small downstairs
bathroom together. Sam loves to watch people urinate. Sometimes he
sings, to harmonize with the sound of the urine going into the water.
There are footprints and pawprints everywhere. Tucker is shrieking with
laughter in the living room. “…he says, he says to the other one, ‘Then,
dearie, have you ever played spin the bottle?’ ” Frank’s and Tucker’s
laughter drowns out the sound of Freddy peeing in the bathroom. I turn
on the water in the kitchen sink, and it drowns out all the noise. I
begin to scrape the dishes. Tucker is telling another story when I turn
off the water: “…that it was Onassis in the Anvil, and nothing would
talk him out of it. They told him Onassis was dead, and he thought they
were trying to make him think he was crazy. There was nothing to do but
go along with him, but, God—he was trying to goad this poor old fag into
fighting about Stavros Niarchos. You know—Onassis’s enemy. He thought it
was Onassis. In the Anvil.” There is a sound of a glass breaking. Frank
or Tucker puts “John Coltrane Live in Seattle” on the stereo and turns
the volume down low. The bathroom door opens. Sam runs into the kitchen
and begins to lap water from his dish. Freddy takes his little silver
case and his rolling papers out of his shirt pocket. He puts a piece of
paper on the kitchen table and is about to sprinkle grass on it, but
realizes just in time that the paper has absorbed water from a puddle.
He balls it up with his thumb, flicks it to the floor, puts a piece of
rolling paper where the table’s dry and shakes a line of grass down it.
“You smoke this,” he says to me. “I’ll do the dishes.”</p>
<p>“We’ll both smoke it. I’ll wash and you can wipe.”</p>
<p>“I forgot to tell them I put ashes in the sauce,” he says.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t interrupt.”</p>
<p>“At least he pays Frank ten times what any other accountant for an
art gallery would make,” Freddy says.</p>
<p>Tucker is beating his hand on the arm of the sofa as he talks,
stomping his feet. “…so he’s trying to feel him out, to see if this old
guy with the dyed hair knew Maria Callas. Jesus! And he’s so out of it
he’s trying to think what opera singers are called, and instead of
coming up with ‘diva’ he comes up with ‘duenna.’ At this point, Larry
Betwell went up to him and tried to calm him down, and he breaks into
song—some aria or something that Maria Callas was famous for. Larry told
him he was going to lose his teeth if he didn’t get it together,
and…”</p>
<p>“He spends a lot of time in gay hangouts, for not being gay,” Freddy
says.</p>
<p>I scream and jump back from the sink, hitting the glass I’m rinsing
against the faucet, shattering green glass everywhere.</p>
<p>“What?” Freddy says. “Jesus Christ, what is it?”</p>
<p>Too late, I realize what it must have been that I saw: J.D. in a goat
mask, the puckered pink plastic lips against the window beside the
kitchen sink.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” J.D. says, coming through the door and nearly colliding
with Frank, who has rushed into the kitchen. Tucker is right behind
him.</p>
<p>“Ooh,” Tucker says, feigning disappointment, “I thought Freddy
smooched her.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” J.D. says again. “I thought you’d know it was me.”</p>
<p>The rain must have started again, because J.D. is soaking wet. He has
turned the mask around so that the goat’s head stares out from the back
of his head. “I got lost,” J.D. says. He has a farmhouse upstate. “I
missed the turn. I went miles. I missed the whole dinner, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“What did you do wrong?” Frank asks.</p>
<p>“I didn’t turn left onto 58. I don’t know why I didn’t realize my
mistake, but I went miles. It was raining so hard I couldn’t go over
twenty-five miles an hour. Your driveway is all mud. You’re going to
have to push me out.”</p>
<p>“There’s some roast left over. And salad, if you want it,” I say.</p>
<p>“Bring it in the living room,” Frank says to J.D. Freddy is holding
out a plate to him. J.D. reaches for the plate. Freddy pulls it back.
J.D. reaches again, and Freddy is so stoned that he isn’t quick enough
this time—J.D. grabs it.</p>
<p>“I thought you’d know it was me,” J.D. says. “I apologize.” He dishes
salad onto the plate. “You’ll be rid of me for six months, in the
morning.”</p>
<p>“Where does your plane leave from?” Freddy says.</p>
<p>“Kennedy.”</p>
<p>“Come in here!” Tucker calls. “I’ve got a story for you about Perry
Dwyer down at the Anvil last week, when he thought he saw Aristotle
Onassis.”</p>
<p>“Who’s Perry Dwyer?” J.D. says.</p>
<p>“That is not the point of the story, dear man. And when you’re in
Cassis, I want you to look up an American painter over there. Will you?
He doesn’t have a phone. Anyway—I’ve been tracking him, and I know where
he is now, and I am very interested, if you would stress that with him,
to do a show in June that will be only him. He doesn’t answer my
letters.”</p>
<p>“Your hand is cut,” J.D. says to me.</p>
<p>“Forget it,” I say. “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he says. “Did I make you do that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you did.”</p>
<p>“Don’t keep your finger under the water. Put pressure on it to stop
the bleeding.”</p>
<p>He puts the plate on the table. Freddy is leaning against the
counter, staring at the blood swirling in the sink, and smoking the
joint all by himself. I can feel the little curls on my forehead that
Freddy was talking about. They feel heavy on my skin. I hate to see my
own blood. I’m sweating. I let J.D. do what he does; he turns off the
water and wraps his hand around my second finger, squeezing. Water runs
down our wrists.</p>
<p>Freddy jumps to answer the phone when it rings, as though a siren
just went off behind him. He calls me to the phone, but J.D. steps in
front of me, shakes his head no, and takes the dish towel and wraps it
around my hand before he lets me go.</p>
<p>“Well,” Marilyn says. “I had the best of intentions, but my battery’s
dead.”</p>
<p>J.D. is standing behind me, with his hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“I’ll be right over,” I say. “He’s not upset now, is he?”</p>
<p>“No, but he’s dropped enough hints that he doesn’t think he can make
it through the night.”</p>
<p>“O.K.,” I say. “I’m sorry about all of this.”</p>
<p>“Six years old,” Marilyn says. “Wait till he grows up and gets that
feeling.”</p>
<p>I hang up.</p>
<p>“Let me see your hand,” J.D. says.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to look at it. Just go get me a Band-Aid, please.”</p>
<p>He turns and goes upstairs. I unwrap the towel and look at it. It’s
pretty deep, but no glass is in my finger. I feel funny; the outlines of
things are turning yellow. I sit in the chair by the phone. Sam comes
and lies beside me, and I stare at his black-and-yellow tail, beating. I
reach down with my good hand and pat him, breathing deeply in time with
every second pat.</p>
<p>“Rothko?” Tucker says bitterly, in the living room. “Nothing is great
that can appear on greeting cards. Wyeth is that way. Would ‘Christina’s
World’ look bad on a cocktail napkin? You know it wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>I jump as the phone rings again. “Hello?” I say, wedging the phone
against my shoulder with my ear, wrapping the dish towel tighter around
my hand.</p>
<p>“Tell them it’s a crank call, tell them anything,” Johnny says. “I
miss you. How’s Saturday night at your house?”</p>
<p>“All right,” I say. I catch my breath.</p>
<p>“Everything’s all right here, too. Yes indeed. Roast rack of lamb.
Friend of Nicole’s who’s going to Key West tomorrow had too much to
drink and got depressed because he thought it was raining in Key West,
and I said I’d go in my study and call the National Weather Service.
Hello, Weather Service. How are you?”</p>
<p>J.D. comes down from upstairs with two Band-Aids and stands beside
me, unwrapping one. I want to say to Johnny, “I’m cut. I’m bleeding.
It’s no joke.”</p>
<p>It’s all right to talk in front of J.D., but I don’t know who else
might overhear me.</p>
<p>“I’d say they made the delivery about four this afternoon,” I
say.</p>
<p>“This is the church, this is the steeple. Open the door, and see all
the people,” Johnny says. “Take care of yourself. I’ll hang up and find
out if it’s raining in Key West.”</p>
<p>“Late in the afternoon,” I say. “Everything is fine.”</p>
<p>“Nothing is fine,” Johnny says. “Take care of yourself.”</p>
<p>He hangs up. I put the phone down, and realize that I’m still having
trouble focussing, the sight of my cut finger made me so light-headed. I
don’t look at the finger again as J.D. undoes the towel and wraps the
Band-Aids around my finger.</p>
<p>“What’s going on in here?” Frank says, coming into the dining
room.</p>
<p>“I cut my finger,” I say. “It’s O.K.”</p>
<p>“You did?” he says. He looks woozy—a little drunk. “Who keeps
calling?”</p>
<p>“Marilyn. Mark changed his mind about staying all night. She was
going to bring him home, but her battery’s dead. You’ll have to get him.
Or I will.”</p>
<p>“Who called the second time?” he says.</p>
<p>“The oil company. They wanted to know if we got our delivery
today.”</p>
<p>He nods. “I’ll go get him, if you want,” he says. He lowers his
voice. “Tucker’s probably going to whirl himself into a tornado for an
encore,” he says, nodding toward the living room. “I’ll take him with
me.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to go get him?” J.D. says.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind getting some air,” Frank says. “Thanks, though. Why
don’t you go in the living room and eat your dinner?”</p>
<p>“You forgive me?” J.D. says.</p>
<p>“Sure,” I say. “It wasn’t your fault. Where did you get that
mask?”</p>
<p>“I found it on top of a Goodwill box in Manchester. There was also a
beautiful old birdcage—solid brass.”</p>
<p>The phone rings again. I pick it up. “Wouldn’t I love to be in Key
West with you,” Johnny says. He makes a sound as though he’s kissing me
and hangs up.</p>
<p>“Wrong number,” I say.</p>
<p>Frank feels in his pants pocket for the car keys.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>J.D. knows about Johnny. He introduced me, in the faculty lounge,
where J.D. and I had gone to get a cup of coffee after I registered for
classes. After being gone for nearly two years, J.D. still gets mail at
the department—he said he had to stop by for the mail anyway, so he’d
drive me to campus and point me toward the registrar’s. J.D. taught
English; now he does nothing. J.D. is glad that I’ve gone back to
college to study art again, now that Mark is in school. I’m six credits
away from an M.A. in art history. He wants me to think about myself,
instead of thinking about Mark all the time. He talks as though I could
roll Mark out on a string and let him fly off, high above me. J.D.’s
wife and son died in a car crash. His son was Mark’s age. “I wasn’t
prepared,” J.D. said when we were driving over that day. He always says
this when he talks about it. “How could you be prepared for such a
thing?” I asked him. “I am now,” he said. Then, realizing he was acting
very hardboiled, made fun of himself. “Go on,” he said, “punch me in the
stomach. Hit me as hard as you can.” We both knew he isn’t prepared for
anything. When he couldn’t find a parking place that day, his hands were
wrapped around the wheel so tightly that his knuckles turned white.</p>
<p>Johnny came in as we were drinking coffee. J.D. was looking at his
junk mail—publishers wanting him to order anthologies, ways to get free
dictionaries.</p>
<p>“You are so lucky to be out of it,” Johnny said, by way of greeting.
“What do you do when you’ve spent two weeks on ‘Hamlet’ and the student
writes about Hamlet’s good friend Horchow?”</p>
<p>He threw a blue book into J.D.’s lap. J.D. sailed it back.</p>
<p>“Johnny,” he said, “this is Amy.”</p>
<p>“Hi, Amy,” Johnny said.</p>
<p>“You remember when Frank Wayne was in graduate school here? Amy’s
Frank’s wife.”</p>
<p>“Hi, Amy,” Johnny said.</p>
<p>J.D. told me he knew it the instant Johnny walked into the room—he
knew that second that he should introduce me as somebody’s wife. He
could have predicted it all from the way Johnny looked at me.</p>
<p>For a long time J.D. gloated that he had been prepared for what
happened next—that Johnny and I were going to get together. It took me
to disturb his pleasure in himself—me, crying hysterically on the phone
last month, not knowing what to do, what move to make next.</p>
<p>“Don’t do anything for a while. I guess that’s my advice,” J.D. said.
“But you probably shouldn’t listen to me. All I can do myself is run
away, hide out. I’m not the learned professor. You know what I believe.
I believe all that wicked fairy-tale crap: your heart will break, your
house will burn.”</p>
<p>Tonight, because he doesn’t have a garage at his farm, J.D. has come
to leave his car in the empty half of our two-car garage while he’s in
France. I look out the window and see his old Saab, glowing in the
moonlight. J.D. has brought his favorite book, “A Vision,” to read on
the plane. He says his suitcase contains only a spare pair of jeans,
cigarettes, and underwear. He is going to buy a leather jacket in
France, at a store where he almost bought a leather jacket two years
ago.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>In our bedroom there are about twenty small glass prisms hung with
fishing line from one of the exposed beams; they catch the morning
light, and we stare at them like a cat eying catnip held above its head.
Just now, it is 2 a.m. At six-thirty, they will be filled with dazzling
color. At four or five, Mark will come into the bedroom and get in bed
with us. Sam will wake up, stretch, and shake, and the tags on his
collar will clink, and he will yawn and shake again and go downstairs,
where J.D. is asleep in his sleeping bag and Tucker is asleep on the
sofa, and get a drink of water from his dish. Mark has been coming into
our bedroom for about a year. He gets onto the bed by climbing up on a
footstool that horrified me when I first saw it—a gift from Frank’s
mother: a footstool that says “Today Is the First Day of the Rest of
Your Life” in needlepoint. I kept it in a closet for years, but it
occurred to me that it would help Mark get up onto the bed, so he would
not have to make a little leap and possibly skin his shin again. Now
Mark does not disturb us when he comes into the bedroom, except that it
bothers me that he has reverted to sucking his thumb. Sometimes he lies
in bed with his cold feet against my leg. Sometimes, small as he is, he
snores.</p>
<p>Somebody is playing a record downstairs. It’s the Velvet
Underground—Nico, in a dream or swoon, singing “Sunday Morning.” I can
barely hear the whispering and tinkling of the record. I can only follow
it because I’ve heard it a hundred times.</p>
<p>I am lying in bed, waiting for Frank to get out of the bathroom. My
cut finger throbs. Things are going on in the house even though I have
gone to bed; water runs, the record plays, Sam is still downstairs, so
there must be some action.</p>
<p>I have known everybody in the house for years, and as time goes by I
know them all less and less. J.D. was Frank’s adviser in college. Frank
was his best student, and they started to see each other outside of
class. They played handball. J.D. and his family came to dinner. We went
there. That summer—the summer Frank decided to go to graduate school in
business instead of English—J.D.’s wife and son deserted him in a more
horrible way, in that car crash. J.D. has quit his job. He has been to
Las Vegas, to Colorado, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Paris twice; he tapes
postcards to the walls of his living room. A lot of the time, on the
weekends, he shows up at our house with his sleeping bag. Sometimes he
brings a girl. Lately, not. Years ago, Tucker was in Frank’s therapy
group in New York, and ended up hiring Frank to work as the accountant
for his gallery. Tucker was in therapy at the time because he was
obsessed with foreigners. Now he is also obsessed with homosexuals. He
gives fashionable parties to which he invites many foreigners and
homosexuals. Before the parties he does TM and yoga, and during the
parties he does Seconals and isometrics. When I first met him, he was
living for the summer in his sister’s house in Vermont while she was in
Europe, and he called us one night, in New York, in a real panic because
there were wasps all over. They were “hatching,” he said—big, sleepy
wasps that were everywhere. We said we’d come; we drove all through the
night to get to Brattleboro. It was true: there were wasps on the
undersides of plates, in the plants, in the folds of curtains. Tucker
was so upset that he was out behind the house, in the cold Vermont
morning, wrapped like an Indian in a blanket, with only his pajamas on
underneath. He was sitting in a lawn chair, hiding behind a bush,
waiting for us to come.</p>
<p>And Freddy—“Reddy Fox,” when Frank is feeling affectionate toward
him. When we first met, I taught him to ice-skate and he taught me to
waltz; in the summer, at Atlantic City, he’d go with me on a roller
coaster that curved high over the waves. I was the one—not Frank—who
would get out of bed in the middle of the night and meet him at an
all-night deli and put my arm around his shoulders, the way he put his
arm around my shoulders on the roller coaster, and talk quietly to him
until he got over his latest anxiety attack. Now he tests me, and I
retreat: this man he picked up, this man who picked him up, how it feels
to have forgotten somebody’s name when your hand is in the back pocket
of his jeans and you’re not even halfway to your apartment. Reddy
Fox—admiring my new red silk blouse, stroking his fingertips down the
front, and my eyes wide, because I could feel his fingers on my chest,
even though I was holding the blouse in front of me on a hanger to be
admired. All those moments, and all they meant was that I was fooled
into thinking I knew these people because I knew the small things, the
personal things.</p>
<p>Freddy will always be more stoned than I am, because he feels
comfortable getting stoned with me and I’ll always be reminded that he’s
more lost. Tucker knows he can come to the house and be the center of
attention; he can tell all the stories he knows, and we’ll never tell
the story we know about him hiding in the bushes like a frightened dog.
J.D. comes back from his trips with boxes full of postcards, and I look
at all of them as though they’re photographs taken by him, and I know,
and he knows, that what he likes about them is their flatness—the
unreality of them, the unreality of what he does.</p>
<p>Last summer, I read “The Metamorphosis” and said to J.D., “Why did
Gregor Samsa wake up a cockroach?” His answer (which he would have toyed
over with his students forever) was “Because that’s what people expected
of him.”</p>
<p>They make the illogical logical. I don’t do anything, because I’m
waiting, I’m on hold (J.D.); I stay stoned because I know it’s better to
be out of it (Freddy); I love art because I myself am a work of art
(Tucker).</p>
<p>Frank is harder to understand. One night a week or so ago, I thought
we were really attuned to each other, communicating by telepathic waves,
and as I lay in bed about to speak I realized that the vibrations really
existed: they were him, snoring.</p>
<p>Now he’s coming into the bedroom, and I’m trying again to think what
to say. Or ask. Or do.</p>
<p>“Be glad you’re not in Key West,” he says. He climbs into bed.</p>
<p>I raise myself up on one elbow and stare at him.</p>
<p>“There’s a hurricane about to hit,” he says.</p>
<p>“What?” I say. “Where did you hear that?”</p>
<p>“When Reddy Fox and I were putting the dishes away. We had the radio
on.” He doubles up his pillow, pushes it under his neck. “Boom goes
everything,” he says, “Bam. Crash. Poof.” He looks at me. “You look
shocked.” He closes his eyes. Then, after a minute or two, he murmurs,
“Hurricanes upset you? I’ll try to think of something nice.”</p>
<p>He is quiet for so long that I think he has fallen asleep, Then he
says, “Cars that run on water. A field of flowers, none alike. A
shooting star that goes slow enough for you to watch. Your life to do
over again.”</p>
<p>He has been whispering in my ear, and when he takes his mouth away I
shiver. He slides lower in the bed for sleep. “I’ll tell you something
really amazing,” he says. “Tucker told me he went into a travel agency
on Park Avenue last week and asked the travel agent where he should go
to pan for gold, and she told him.”</p>
<p>“Where did she tell him to go?”</p>
<p>“I think somewhere in Peru. The banks of some river in Peru.”</p>
<p>“Did you decide what you’re going to do after Mark’s birthday?” I
say.</p>
<p>He doesn’t answer me. I touch him on the side, finally.</p>
<p>“It’s two o’clock in the morning. Let’s talk about it another
time.”</p>
<p>“You picked the house, Frank. They’re your friends downstairs. I used
to be what you wanted me to be.”</p>
<p>“They’re your friends, too,” he says. “Don’t be paranoid.”</p>
<p>“I want to know if you’re staying or going.”</p>
<p>He takes a deep breath, lets it out, and continues to lie very
still.</p>
<p>“Everything you’ve done is commendable,” he says. “You did the right
thing to go back to school. You tried to do the right thing by finding
yourself a normal friend like Marilyn. But your whole life you’ve made
one mistake—you’ve surrounded yourself with men. Let me tell you
something. All men—if they’re crazy, like Tucker, if they’re gay as the
Queen of the May, like Reddy Fox, even if they’re just six years old—I’m
going to tell you something about them. Men think they’re Spider-Man and
Buck Rogers and Superman. You know what we all feel inside that you
don’t feel? That we’re going to the stars.”</p>
<p>He takes my hand. “I’m looking down on all of this from space,” he
whispers. “I’m already gone.”</p>
