<h4 id="the-state-of-grace">The State of Grace</h4>
<p>By Harold Brodkey (1954)</p>
<p>There is a certain shade of red brick—a dark, almost melodious red,
sombre and riddled with blue—that is my childhood in St. Louis. Not the
real childhood, but the false one that extends from the dawning of
consciousness until the day that one leaves home for college and
manhood. That one shade of red brick and green foliage is St. Louis in
the summer (the winter is just a gray sky and a crowded school bus and
the wet footprints on the brown linoleum floor at school), and that
brick and a pale sky is spring. It’s also heartbreak and loneliness and
the queer, self-pitying wonder that children whose families are having
catastrophes feel.</p>
<p>I can remember that brick best on the back of our apartment house; it
was on all the apartment houses on that block, and also on the apartment
house where Edward lived. Edward was a small boy I took care of on the
evenings when his parents went out. As I came up the street from school,
past the boulevard and its ugliness (the vista of shoe-repair shops,
dime stores, hairdressers’, pet shops, the Tivoli Theatre, and the
closed Piggly Wiggly, about to be converted into a Kroger’s), past the
place where I could see the Masonic Temple, built in the shape of some
Egyptian relic, and the two huge concrete pedestals flanking the
boulevard (what they supported I can’t remember, but on both of them, in
brown paint, was a large heart and the information that someone named
Erica loved someone named Peter), past the post office, built in W.P.A.
days of yellow brick and chrome, I hurried toward the moment when at
last, on the other side, past the driveway of the garage of the
Castlereagh Apartments, I would be at the place where the trees began,
the apartment houses of dark-red brick, and the empty stillness.</p>
<p>In the middle of that stillness and red brick was my neighborhood,
the terribly familiar place where I was more comfortably an exile than
anywhere else. There were two locust trees that were beautiful to me—I
think because they were small and I could encompass them (not only with
my mind and heart but with my hands as well). Then came an apartment
house of red brick (but not quite the true shade) where a boy I knew
lived, and two amazingly handsome brothers, who were also strong and
kind, but much older than I and totally uninterested in me. Then came an
alley of black macadam and another vista, which I found shameful but
drearily comfortable, of garages and ash pits and telephone poles and
the backs of apartment houses—including ours—on one side, the backs of
houses on the other. I knew many people in the apartments but none in
the houses, and this was the ultimate proof, of course, to me of how
miserably degraded I was and how far sunken beneath the surface of the
sea. I was on the bottom, looking up through the waters, through the
shifting bands of light—through, oh, innumerably more complexities than
I could stand—at a sailboat driven by the wind, some boy who had a
family and a home like other people.</p>
<p>I was thirteen, and six feet tall, and I weighed a hundred and
twenty-five pounds. Though I fretted wildly about my looks (my ears
stuck out and my hair was like wire), I also knew I was attractive;
girls had smiled at me, but none whom I might love and certainly none of
the seven or eight goddesses in the junior high school I attended.
Starting in about second grade, I always had the highest grades—higher
than anybody who had ever attended the schools I went to—and I terrified
my classmates. What terrified them was that so far as they could see, it
never took any effort; it was like legerdemain. I was never teased, I
was never tormented; I was merely isolated. But I was known as “the
walking encyclopedia,” and the only way I could deal with this was to
withdraw. Looking back, I’m almost certain I could have had friends if
I’d made the right overtures, and that it was not my situation but my
forbidding pride that kept them off; I’m not sure. I had very few
clothes, and all that I had had been passed to me from an elder cousin.
I never was able to wear what the other boys wore.</p>
<p>Our apartment was on the third floor. I usually walked up the back
stairs, which were mounted outside the building in a steel framework. I
preferred the back stairs—it was a form of rubbing at a hurt to make
sure it was still there—because they were steep and ugly and had garbage
cans on the landings and wash hanging out, while the front door opened
off a court where rosebushes grew, and the front stairs were made of
some faintly yellow local marble that was cool and pleasant to the touch
and to the eye. When I came to our back door, I would open the screen
and call out to see if my mother was home. If she was not home, it
usually meant that she was visiting my father, who had been dying in the
hospital for four years and would linger two more before he would come
to terms with death. As far as I know, that was the only sign of
character he ever showed in his entire life, and I suppose it was
considerable, but I hoped, and even sometimes prayed, that he would
die—not only because I wouldn’t have to visit the hospital again, where
the white-walled rooms were filled with odors and sick old men (and a
tangible fear that made me feel a falling away inside, like the plunge
into the unconscious when the anesthetic is given), but because my
mother might marry again and make us all rich and happy once more. She
was still lovely then, still alight with the curious incandescence of
physical beauty. There was a man who had loved her for twenty years and
who loved her yet and wanted to marry her. I wished so hard my father
would die, but he just wouldn’t. If my mother was home, I braced myself
for unpleasantness, because she didn’t like me to sit and read; she
hated me to read. She wanted to drive me outdoors, where I would become
an athlete and be like other boys and be popular. It filled her with
rage when I ignored her advice and opened a book; once, she rushed up to
me, her face suffused with anger, took the book (I think it was “Pride
and Prejudice”), and hurled it out the third-story window. At the time,
I sat and tried to sneer, thinking she was half mad, with her
exaggerated rage, and so foolish not to realize that I could be none of
the things she thought I ought to be. But now I think—perhaps
wistfully—that she was merely desperate, driven to extremes in her
anxiety to save me. She felt—she knew, in fact—that there was going to
come a moment when, like an acrobat, I was going to have to climb on her
shoulders and on the shoulders of all the things she had done for me,
and leap out into a life she couldn’t imagine (and which I am leading
now), and if she wanted to send me out wrapped in platitudes, in an
athletic body, with a respect for money, it was because she thought that
was the warmest covering.</p>
<p>But when I was thirteen, I only wondered how anyone so lovely could
be so impossible. She somehow managed it so that I hated her far more
than I loved her, even though in the moments before sleep I would think
of her face, letting my memory begin with the curving gentleness of her
eyelid and circle through all the subtle interplay of shadows and
hollows and bones, and the half-remembered warmth of her chest, and it
would seem to me that this vision of her, always standing in half light
(as probably I had seen her once when I was younger, and sick, perhaps,
though I don’t really remember), was only as beautiful to me as the
pattern in an immeasurably ancient and faded Persian rug. In the vision,
as in the rug, I could trace the lines in and out and experience some
unnamed pleasure, but it had almost no meaning, numbed as I was by the
problems of my sonhood.</p>
<p>Being Jewish also disturbed me, because it meant I could never be one
of the golden people—the blond athletes, with their easy charm. If my
family had been well off, I might have felt otherwise, but I doubt
it.</p>
<p>My mother had a cousin whom I called Aunt Rachel, and we used to go
and see her three or four times a year. I hated it. She lived in what
was called the Ghetto, which was a section of old houses in downtown
St. Louis with tiny front porches and two doors, one to the upstairs and
one to the downstairs. Most people lived in them only until they could
move to something better; no one had ever liked living there. And
because of that, the neighborhood had the quality of being blurred; the
grass was never neat, the window frames were never painted, no one cared
about or loved the place. It was where the immigrants lived when they
arrived by train from New York and before they could move uptown to the
apartments near Delmar Boulevard, and eventually to the suburbs—to
Clayton, Laclede, and Ladue. Aunt Rachel lived downstairs. Her living
room was very small and had dark-yellow wallpaper, which she never
changed. She never cleaned it, either, because once I made a mark on it,
to see if she would, and she didn’t. The furniture was alive and
frightening. It was like that part of the nightmare where it gets so bad
that you decide to wake up. I always had to sit on it. It bulged in
great curves of horsehair and mohair, and it was dark purple and maroon
and dark green, and the room had no light in it anywhere. Somewhere on
the other side of the old, threadbare satin draperies that had been
bought out of an old house was fresh air and sunshine, but you’d never
know it. It was as much like a peasant’s hut as Aunt Rachel could
manage, buying furniture in cut-rate furniture stores. And always there
were the smells—the smell of onion soup and garlic and beets. It was the
only place where I was ever rude to my mother in public. It was always
full of people whom I hardly ever knew, but who knew me, and I had to
perform. My mother would say, “Tell the people what your last report
card was,” or “Recite them the poem that Miss Huntington liked so well.”
That was when the feeling of unreality was strongest. Looking back now,
I think that what frightened me was their fierce urgency; I was to be
rich and famous and make all their tribulations worth while. But I
didn’t want that responsibility. Anyway, if I were going to be what they
wanted me to be, and if I had to be what I was, then it was too much to
expect me to take them as they were. I had to go beyond them and despise
them, but first I had to be with them—and it wasn’t fair.</p>
<p>It was as if my eyelids had been propped open, and I had to see these
things I didn’t want to see. I felt as if I had taken part in something
shameful, and therefore I wasn’t a nice person. It was like my first
sexual experiences: What if anyone knew? What if everyone found out?…How
in hell could I ever be gallant and carefree, like the blond
athletes?</p>
<p>I had read too many books by Englishmen and New Englanders to want to
know anything but graceful things and erudite things and the look of
white frame houses on green lawns. I could always console myself by
thinking my brains would make me famous (brains were good for something,
weren’t they?), but then my children would have good childhoods—not me.
I was irrevocably deprived, and it was the irrevocableness that hurt,
that finally drove me away from any sensible adjustment with life to the
position that dreams had to come true or there was no point in living at
all. If dreams came true, then I would have my childhood in one form or
another, someday.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>If my mother was home when I came in from school, she might say that
Mrs. Leinberg had called and wanted me to baby-sit, and I would be
plunged into yet another of the dilemmas of those years. I had to
baby-sit to earn money to buy my lunch at school, and there were times,
considering the dilemma I faced at the Leinbergs’, when I preferred not
eating, or eating very little, to baby-sitting. But there wasn’t any
choice; Mother would have accepted for me, and made Mrs. Leinberg
promise not to stay out too late and deprive me of my sleep. She would
have a sandwich ready for me to eat, so that I could rush over in time
to let Mr. and Mrs. Leinberg go out to dinner. Anyway, I would eat my
sandwich reading a book, to get my own back, and then I would set out.
As I walked down the back stairs on my way to the Leinbergs’, usually
swinging on the railings by my arms to build up my muscles, I would
think forlornly of what it was to be me, and wish things were otherwise,
and I did not understand myself or my loneliness or the cruel
deprivation the vista down the alley meant.</p>
<p>There was a short cut across the back yards to the apartment house
where the Leinbergs lived, but I always walked by my two locust trees
and spent a few moments loving them; so far as I knew, I loved nothing
else.</p>
<p>Then I turned right and crossed the street and walked past an
apartment house that had been built at right angles to the street,
facing a strange declivity that had once been an excavation for still
another apartment house, which had never been built, because of the
depression. On the other side of the declivity was a block of three
apartment houses, and the third was the Leinbergs’. Every apartment in
it had at least eight rooms, and the back staircase was enclosed, and
the building had its own garages. All this made it special and
expensive, and a landmark in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Mr. Leinberg was a cosmetics manufacturer and very successful. I
thought he was a smart man, but I don’t remember him at all well (I
never looked at men closely in those days but always averted my head in
shyness and embarrassment; they might guess how fiercely I wanted to
belong to them) and I could have been wrong. Certainly the atmosphere
then, during the war years—it was 1943—was that everyone was getting
rich; everyone who could work, that is. At any rate, he was getting
rich, and it was only a matter of time before the Leinbergs moved from
that apartment house to Laclede or Ladue and had a forty-thousand-dollar
house with grounds.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leinberg was very pretty; she was dark, like my mother, but not
as beautiful. For one thing, she was too small; she was barely five feet
tall, and I towered over her. For another, she was not at all regal. But
her lipstick was never on her teeth, and her dresses were usually new,
and her eyes were kind. (My mother’s eyes were incomprehensible; they
were dark stages where dimly seen mob scenes were staged and all one
ever sensed was tumult and drama, and no matter how long one waited, the
lights never went up and the scene never was explained.) Mrs. Leinberg
would invite me to help myself in the icebox, and then she would write
down the telephone number of the place where she was going to be. “Keep
Edward in the back of the apartment, where he won’t disturb the baby,”
she would tell me. “If the baby does wake up, pick her up right away.
That’s very important. I didn’t pick Edward up, and I’ll always regret
it.” She said that every time, even though Edward was lurking in the
back hallway, waiting for his parents to leave so he could run out and
jump on me and our world could come alive again. He would listen, his
small face—he was seven—quite blank with hurt and the effort to pierce
the hurt with understanding.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leinberg would say, “Call me if she wakes up.” And then,
placatingly, to her husband, “I’ll just come home to put her back to
sleep, and then I’ll go right back to the party—” Then, to me, “But she
almost always sleeps, so don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Greta. He knows what to do,” Mr. Leinberg would say
impatiently.</p>
<p>I always imagined contempt in his voice—contempt for us both. I would
be standing by the icebox looking down on the two little married people.
Mr. Leinberg had a very red mouth. “Come on, Greta,” it would say.
“We’ll be back by eleven,” it would say to me.</p>
<p>“Edward goes to bed at nine,” Mrs. Leinberg would say, her voice high
and birdlike, but tremulous with confusion and vagueness. Then she would
be swept out the front door, so much prettily dressed matchwood, in her
husband’s wake. When the door closed, Edward would come hurtling down
the hall and tackle my knees if I was staring after his parents, or, if
I was facing him, leap onto my chest and into my arms.</p>
<p>“What shall we play tonight?”</p>
<p>He would ask that and I would have to think. He trembled with
excitement, because I could always make the games wonderful to him—like
his daydreams, in fact. Because he was a child, he trusted me almost
totally, and I could do anything with him. I had that power with
children until I was in college and began at last to be like other
people.</p>
<p>In Edward’s bedroom was a large closet; it had a rack for clothes, a
washstand, a built-in table, and fifteen or twenty shelves. The table
and shelves were crowded with toys and games and sports equipment. I
owned a Monopoly board I had inherited from my older sister, an old
baseball glove (which was so cheap I never dared use it in front of my
classmates, who had real gloves signed by real players), and a
collection of postcards. The first time I saw that closet, I practically
exploded with pleasure; I took down each of the games and toys and
played with them, one after another, with Edward. Edward loved the fact
that we never played a game to its conclusion but would leap from game
to game after only a few moves, until the leaping became the real game
and the atmosphere of laughter the real sport.</p>
<p>It was comfortable for me in the back room, alone in the apartment
with Edward, because at last I was chief; and not only that, I was not
being seen. There was no one there thinking of me or what I should be or
how I should behave; and I have always been terrified of what people
thought of me, as if what they thought was a hulking creature that would
confront me if I should turn a corner.</p>
<p>There were no corners. Edward and I would take his toy pistols and
stalk each other around the bed. Other times, we were on the bed, the
front gun turret of a battleship sailing to battle the Japanese fleet in
the Indian Ocean. Edward would close his eyes and roll with pleasure
when I went “Boom! Boom! BOOOOM!”</p>
<p>“It’s sinking! It’s sinking, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“No, stupid. We only hit its funnel. We have to shoot again. Boom,
Boom—”</p>
<p>Edward’s fingers would press his eyelids in a spasm of ecstasy; his
delirious, taut, little boy’s body would fall backward on the soft
pillows and bounce, and his back would curve; the excited breathy
laughter would pour out like so many leaves spilling into spring, so
many lilacs thrusting into bloom.</p>
<p>Under the bed, in a foxhole (Edward had a Cub Scout hat and I had his
plastic soldier helmet), we turned back the yellow hordes from
Guadalcanal. Edward dearly loved to be wounded. “I’m hit!” he’d shriek.
“I’m hit!” He’d press his hand against his stomach and writhe on the
wooden floor. “They shot me in the guts—”</p>
<p>I didn’t approve of his getting wounded so soon, because then the
scene was over; both his and my sense of verisimilitude didn’t allow
someone to be wounded and then get up. I remember how pleased he was
when I invented the idea that after he got wounded, he could be someone
else; so, when we crawled under the bed, we would decide to be eight or
twelve or twenty Marines, ten each to get wounded, killed, or maimed as
we saw fit, provided enough survived so that when we crawled out from
under the bed we could charge the Japanese position under the
dining-room table and leave it strewn with corpses.</p>
<p>Edward was particularly good at the detective game, which was a lot
more involved and difficult. In that, we would walk into the kitchen,
and I would tell him that we had received a call about a murder. Except
when we played Tarzan, we never found it necessary to be characters.
However, we always had names. In the detective game, we were usually Sam
and Fred. We’d get a call telling us who was murdered, and then we’d go
back to the bedroom and examine the corpse and question the suspects.
I’d fire questions at an empty chair. Sometimes Edward would get tired
of being my sidekick and he’d slip into the chair and be the quaking
suspect. Other times, he would prowl around the room on his hands and
knees with a magnifying glass while I stormed and shouted at the
perpetually shifty suspect: “Where were you, Mrs. Eggnogghead [giggles
from Edward], at ten o’clock, when Mr. Eggnogghead [laughter, helpless
with pleasure, from Edward] was slain with the cake knife?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Fred! I found bloodstains.” Edward’s voice would quiver with a
creditable imitation of the excitement of radio detectives.</p>
<p>“Bloodstains! Where, Sam? Where? This may be the clue that breaks the
case.”</p>
<p>Edward could sustain the commedia dell’arte for hours if I wanted him
to. He was a precocious and delicate little boy, quivering with the
malaise of being unloved. When we played, his child’s heart would come
into its own, and the troubled world where his vague hungers went unfed
and mothers and fathers were dim and far away—too far away ever to reach
in and touch the sore place and make it heal—would disappear, along with
the world where I was not sufficiently muscled or sufficiently gallant
to earn my own regard. (What ever had induced my mother to marry that
silly man, who’d been unable to hang on to his money? I could remember
when we’d had a larger house and I’d had toys; why had she let it get
away?) It angered me that Edward’s mother had so little love for him and
so much for her daughter, and that Edward’s father should not appreciate
the boy’s intelligence—he thought Edward was a queer duck, and
effeminate. I could have taught Edward the manly postures. But his
father didn’t think highly of me: I was only a baby-sitter, and
effeminate, too. Why, then, should Edward be more highly regarded by his
father than I myself was? I wouldn’t love him or explain to him.</p>
<p>That, of course, was my terrible dilemma. His apartment house, though
larger than mine, was made of the same dark-red brick, and I wouldn’t
love him. He wasn’t as smart as I’d been at his age, or as fierce. At
his age, I’d already seen the evil in people’s eyes, and I’d begun the
construction of my defenses even then. But Edward’s family was more
prosperous, and the cold winds of insecurity (Where will the money come
from?) hadn’t shredded the dreamy chrysalis of his childhood. He was
still immersed in the dim, wet wonder of the folded wings that might
open if someone loved him; he still hoped, probably, in a butterfly’s
unthinking way, for spring and warmth. How the wings ache, folded so,
waiting; that is, they ache until they atrophy.</p>
<p>So I was thirteen and Edward was seven and he wanted me to love him,
but he was not old enough or strong enough to help me. He could not make
his parents share their wealth and comfort with me, or force them to
give me a place in their home. He was like most of the people I
knew—eager and needful of my love; for I was quite remarkable and made
incredible games, which were better than movies or than the heart could
hope for. I was a dream come true. I was smart and virtuous (no one knew
that I occasionally stole from the dime store) and fairly attractive,
maybe even very attractive. I was often funny and always interesting. I
had read everything and knew everything and got unbelievable grades. Of
course I was someone whose love was desired. Mother, my teachers, my
sister, girls at school, other boys—they all wanted me to love them.</p>
<p>But I wanted them to love me first.</p>
<p>None of them did. I was fierce and solitary and acrid, marching off
the little mile from school, past the post office, all yellow brick and
chrome, and my two locust trees (water, water everywhere and not a drop
to drink), and there was no one who loved me first. I could see a
hundred cravennesses in the people I knew, a thousand flaws, a million
weaknesses. If I had to love first, I would love only perfection. Of
course, I could help heal the people I knew if I loved them. No, I said
to myself, why should I give them everything when they give me
nothing?</p>
<p>How many hurts and shynesses and times of walking up the back stairs
had made me that way? I don’t know. All I know is that Edward needed my
love and I wouldn’t give it to him. I was only thirteen. Many sins can
be forgiven a boy of thirteen, but I’m not thinking of the sin; I’m
thinking of all the years that might have been—if I’d only known then
what I know now. The waste, the God-awful waste.</p>
<p>Really, that’s all there is to this story. The boy I was, the child
Edward was. That and the terrible desire to suddenly turn and run
shouting back through the corridors of time, screaming at the boy I was,
searching him out, and pounding on his chest: Love him, you damn fool,
love him.</p>
