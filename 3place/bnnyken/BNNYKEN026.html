<h4 id="fathers-last-escape">Father’s Last Escape</h4>
<p>By Bruno Schulz (1978)</p>
<p>It happened in the late and forlorn period of complete disruption, at
the time of the liquidation of our business. The signboard had been
removed from over our shop, the shutters were halfway down, and inside
the shop my mother was conducting an unauthorized trade in remnants.
Adela, our servant girl, had gone to America, and it was said that the
boat on which she had sailed had sunk and that all the passengers had
lost their lives. We were unable to verify this rumor, but all trace of
the girl was lost and we never heard of her again.</p>
<p>A new age began—empty, sober, and joyless, like a sheet of white
paper. A new servant girl, Genya, anemic, pale, and boneless, mooned
about the rooms. When one patted her on the back, she wriggled,
stretched like a snake, or purred like a cat. She had a dull white
complexion, and even the insides of her eyelids were white. She was so
absent-minded that she sometimes made a white sauce from old letters and
invoices: it was sickly and inedible.</p>
<p>At that time, my father was definitely dead. He had been dying a
number of times, always with some reservations that forced us to revise
our attitude toward the fact of his death. This had its advantages. By
dividing his death into installments, Father had familiarized us with
his demise. We became gradually indifferent to his returns—each one
shorter, each one more pitiful. His features were already dispersed
throughout the room in which he had lived, and were sprouting in it,
creating at some points strange knots of likeness that were most
expressive. The wallpaper began in certain places to imitate his
habitual nervous tic; the flower designs arranged themselves into the
doleful elements of his smile, symmetrical as the fossilized imprint of
a trilobite. For a time, we gave a wide berth to his fur coat lined with
polecat skins. The fur coat breathed. The panic of small animals sewn
together and biting into one another passed through it in helpless
currents and lost itself in the folds of the fur. Putting one’s ear
against it, one could hear the melodious purring unison of the animals’
sleep. In this well-tanned form, amid the faint smell of polecat,
murder, and night-time matings, my father might have lasted for many
years. But he did not last.</p>
<p>One day, Mother returned home from town with a preoccupied face.</p>
<p>“Look, Joseph,” she said, “what a lucky coincidence. I caught him on
the stairs, jumping from step to step”—and she lifted a handkerchief
that covered something on a plate. I recognized him at once. The
resemblance was striking, although now he was a crab or a large
scorpion. Mother and I exchanged looks: in spite of the metamorphosis,
the resemblance was incredible.</p>
<p>“Is he alive?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Of course. I can hardly hold him,” Mother said. “Shall I place him
on the floor?”</p>
<p>She put the plate down, and, leaning over him, we observed him
closely. There was a hollow place between his numerous curved legs,
which he was moving slightly. His uplifted pincers and feelers seemed to
be listening. I tipped the plate, and Father moved cautiously and with a
certain hesitation onto the floor. Upon touching the flat surface under
him, he gave a sudden start with all of his legs, while his hard
arthropod joints made a clacking sound. I barred his way. He hesitated,
investigated the obstacle with his feelers, then lifted his pincers and
turned aside. We let him run in his chosen direction, where there was no
furniture to give him shelter. Running in wavy jerks on his many legs,
he reached the wall and, before we could stop him, ran lightly up it,
not pausing anywhere. I shuddered with instinctive revulsion as I
watched his progress up the wallpaper. Meanwhile, Father reached a small
built-in kitchen cupboard, hung for a moment on its edge, testing the
terrain with his pincers, and then crawled into it.</p>
<p>He was discovering the apartment afresh from the point of view of a
crab; evidently, he perceived all objects by his sense of smell, for, in
spite of careful checking, I could not find on him any organ of sight.
He seemed to consider carefully the objects he encountered in his path,
stopping and feeling them with his antennae, then embracing them with
his pincers, as if to test them and make their acquaintance; after a
time, he left them and continued on his run, pulling his abdomen behind
him, lifted slightly from the floor. He acted the same way with the
pieces of bread and meat that we threw on the floor for him, hoping he
would eat them. He gave them a perfunctory examination and ran on, not
recognizing that they were edible.</p>
<p>Watching these patient surveys of the room, one could assume that he
was obstinately and indefatigably looking for something. From time to
time, he ran to a corner of the kitchen, crept under a barrel of water
that was leaking, and, upon reaching the puddle, seemed to drink.</p>
<p>Sometimes he disappeared for days on end. He seemed to manage
perfectly well without food, but this did not seem to affect his
vitality. With mixed feelings of shame and repugnance, we concealed by
day our secret fear that he might visit us in bed during the night. But
this never occurred, although in the daytime he would wander all over
the furniture. He particularly liked to stay in the spaces between the
wardrobes and the wall.</p>
<p>We could not discount certain manifestations of reason and even of a
sense of humor. For instance, Father never failed to appear in the
dining room during mealtimes, although his participation in them was
purely symbolic. If the dining-room door was by chance closed during
dinner and he had been left in the next room, he scratched at the bottom
of the door, running up and down along the crack, until we opened it for
him. In time, he learned how to insert his pincers and legs under the
door, and after some elaborate maneuvers he finally succeeded in
insinuating his body through it sideways into the dining room. This
seemed to give him pleasure. He would then stop under the table, lying
quite still, his abdomen slightly pulsating. What the meaning of these
rhythmic pulsations was, we could not imagine. They seemed obscene and
malicious, but at the same time expressed a rather gross and lustful
satisfaction. Our dog, Nimrod, would approach him slowly and, without
conviction, sniff at him cautiously, sneeze, and turn away
indifferently, not having reached any conclusions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the demoralization in our household was increasing. Genya
slept all day long, her slim body bonelessly undulating with her deep
breaths. We often found in the soup reels of cotton, which she had
thrown in unthinkingly with the vegetables. Our shop was open non-stop,
day and night. A continuous sale took place amid complicated bargainings
and discussions. To crown it all, Uncle Charles came to stay.</p>
<p>He was strangely depressed and silent. He declared with a sigh that
after his recent unfortunate experiences he had decided to change his
way of life and devote himself to the study of languages. He never went
out but remained locked in the most remote room—from which Genya had
removed all the carpets and curtains, as she did not approve of our
visitor. There he spent his time, reading old price lists. Several
times, he tried viciously to step on Father. Screaming with horror, we
told him to stop it. Afterward he only smiled wryly to himself, while
Father, not realizing the danger he had been in, hung around and studied
some spots on the floor.</p>
<p>My father, quick and mobile as long as he was on his feet, shared
with all crustaceans the characteristic that when turned on his back he
became largely immobile. It was sad and pitiful to see him desperately
moving all his limbs and rotating helplessly around his own axis. We
could hardly force ourselves to look at the conspicuous, almost
shameless mechanism of his anatomy, completely exposed under the bare
articulated belly. At such moments, Uncle Charles could hardly restrain
himself from stamping on Father. We ran to his rescue with some object
at hand, which he caught tightly with his pincers, quickly regaining his
normal position; then at once he started a lightning, zigzag run at
double speed, as if wanting to obliterate the memory of his unsightly
fall.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>I must force myself to report truthfully the unbelievable deed, from
which my memory recoils even now. To this day I cannot understand how we
became the conscious perpetrators of it. A strange fatality must have
been driving us to it; for fate does not evade consciousness or will but
engulfs them in its mechanism, so that we are able to admit and accept,
as in a hypnotic trance, things that under normal circumstances would
fill us with horror.</p>
<p>Shaken badly, I asked my mother in despair, again and again, “How
could you have done it? If it were Genya who had done it—but you
yourself?” Mother cried, wrung her hands, and could find no answer. Had
she thought that Father would be better off? Had she seen in that act
the only solution to a hopeless situation, or did she do it out of
inconceivable thoughtlessness and frivolity? Fate has a thousand wiles
when it chooses to impose on us its incomprehensible whims. A temporary
blackout, a moment of inattention or blindness is enough to insinuate an
act between the Scylla and Charybdis of decision. Afterward, with
hindsight, we may endlessly ponder that act, explain our motives, try to
discover our true intentions; but the act remains irrevocable.</p>
<p>When Father was brought in on a dish, we came to our senses and
understood fully what had happened. He lay large and swollen from the
boiling, pale gray and jellified. We sat in silence, dumbfounded. Only
Uncle Charles lifted his fork toward the dish, but at once he put it
down uncertainly, looking at us askance. Mother ordered it to be taken
to the sitting room. It stood there afterward on a table covered with a
velvet cloth, next to the album of family photographs and a musical
cigarette box. Avoided by us all, it just stood there.</p>
<p>But my father’s earthly wanderings were not yet at an end, and the
next installment—the extension of the story beyond permissible limits—is
the most painful of all. Why didn’t he give up, why didn’t he admit that
he was beaten when there was every reason to do so and when even fate
could go no farther in utterly confounding him? After several weeks of
immobility in the sitting room, he somehow rallied and seemed to be
slowly recovering. One morning, we found the plate empty. One leg lay on
the edge of the dish, in some congealed tomato sauce and aspic that bore
the traces of his escape. Although boiled and shedding his legs on the
way, with his remaining strength he had dragged himself somewhere to
begin a homeless wandering, and we never saw him again.</p>
