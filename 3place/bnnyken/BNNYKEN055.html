<h4 id="good-people">Good People</h4>
<p>By David Foster Wallace (2007)</p>
<p>They were up on a picnic table at that park by the lake, by the edge
of the lake, with part of a downed tree in the shallows half hidden by
the bank. Lane A. Dean, Jr., and his girlfriend, both in bluejeans and
button-up shirts. They sat up on the table’s top portion and had their
shoes on the bench part that people sat on to picnic or fellowship
together in carefree times. They’d gone to different high schools but
the same junior college, where they had met in campus ministries. It was
springtime, and the park’s grass was very green and the air suffused
with honeysuckle and lilacs both, which was almost too much. There were
bees, and the angle of the sun made the water of the shallows look dark.
There had been more storms that week, with some downed trees and the
sound of chainsaws all up and down his parents’ street. Their postures
on the picnic table were both the same forward kind with their shoulders
rounded and elbows on their knees. In this position the girl rocked
slightly and once put her face in her hands, but she was not crying.
Lane was very still and immobile and looking past the bank at the downed
tree in the shallows and its ball of exposed roots going all directions
and the tree’s cloud of branches all half in the water. The only other
individual nearby was a dozen spaced tables away, by himself, standing
upright. Looking at the torn-up hole in the ground there where the tree
had gone over. It was still early yet and all the shadows wheeling right
and shortening. The girl wore a thin old checked cotton shirt with
pearl-colored snaps with the long sleeves down and always smelled very
good and clean, like someone you could trust and care about even if you
weren’t in love. Lane Dean had liked the smell of her right away. His
mother called her down to earth and liked her, thought she was good
people, you could tell—she made this evident in little ways. The
shallows lapped from different directions at the tree as if almost
teething on it. Sometimes when alone and thinking or struggling to turn
a matter over to Jesus Christ in prayer, he would find himself putting
his fist in his palm and turning it slightly as if still playing and
pounding his glove to stay sharp and alert in center. He did not do this
now; it would be cruel and indecent to do this now. The older individual
stood beside his picnic table—he was at it but not sitting—and looked
also out of place in a suit coat or jacket and the kind of men’s hat
Lane’s grandfather wore in photos as a young insurance man. He appeared
to be looking across the lake. If he moved, Lane didn’t see it. He
looked more like a picture than a man. There were not any ducks in
view.</p>
<p>One thing Lane Dean did was reassure her again that he’d go with her
and be there with her. It was one of the few safe or decent things he
could really say. The second time he said it again now she shook her
head and laughed in an unhappy way that was more just air out her nose.
Her real laugh was different. Where he’d be was the waiting room, she
said. That he’d be thinking about her and feeling bad for her, she knew,
but he couldn’t be in there with her. This was so obviously true that he
felt like a ninny that he’d kept on about it and now knew what she had
thought every time he went and said it—it hadn’t brought her comfort or
eased the burden at all. The worse he felt, the stiller he sat. The
whole thing felt balanced on a knife or wire; if he moved to put his arm
up or touch her the whole thing could tip over. He hated himself for
sitting so frozen. He could almost visualize himself tiptoeing past
something explosive. A big stupid-looking tiptoe, like in a cartoon. The
whole last black week had been this way and it was wrong. He knew it was
wrong, knew something was required of him that was not this terrible
frozen care and caution, but he pretended to himself he did not know
what it was that was required. He pretended it had no name. He pretended
that not saying aloud what he knew to be right and true was for her
sake, was for the sake of her needs and feelings. He also worked dock
and routing at UPS, on top of school, but had traded to get the day off
after they’d decided together. Two days before, he had awakened very
early and tried to pray but could not. He was freezing more and more
solid, he felt like, but he had not thought of his father or the blank
frozenness of his father, even in church, which had once filled him with
such pity. This was the truth. Lane Dean, Jr., felt sun on one arm as he
pictured in his mind an image of himself on a train, waving mechanically
to something that got smaller and smaller as the train pulled away. His
father and his mother’s father had the same birthday, a Cancer. Sheri’s
hair was colored an almost corn blond, very clean, the skin through her
central part pink in the sunlight. They’d sat here long enough that only
their right side was shaded now. He could look at her head, but not at
her. Different parts of him felt unconnected to each other. She was
smarter than him and they both knew it. It wasn’t just school—Lane Dean
was in accounting and business and did all right; he was hanging in
there. She was a year older, twenty, but it was also more—she had always
seemed to Lane to be on good terms with her life in a way that age could
not account for. His mother had put it that she knew what it is she
wanted, which was nursing and not an easy program at Peoria Junior
College, and plus she worked hostessing at the Embers and had bought her
own car. She was serious in a way Lane liked. She had a cousin that died
when she was thirteen, fourteen, that she’d loved and been close with.
She only talked about it that once. He liked her smell and her downy
arms and the way she exclaimed when something made her laugh. He had
liked just being with her and talking to her. She was serious in her
faith and values in a way that Lane had liked and now, sitting here with
her on the table, found himself afraid of. This was an awful thing. He
was starting to believe that he might not be serious in his faith. He
might be somewhat of a hypocrite, like the Assyrians in Isaiah, which
would be a far graver sin than the appointment—he had decided he
believed this. He was desperate to be good people, to still be able to
feel he was good. He rarely before now had thought of damnation and
Hell—that part of it didn’t speak to his spirit—and in worship services
he more just tuned himself out and tolerated Hell when it came up, the
same way you tolerate the job you’ve got to have to save up for what it
is you want. Her tennis shoes had little things doodled on them from
sitting in her class lectures. She stayed looking down like that. Little
notes or reading assignments in Bic in her neat round hand on the rubber
elements around the sneaker’s rim. Lane A. Dean, looking now at her
inclined head’s side’s barrettes in the shape of blue ladybugs. The
appointment was for afternoon, but when the doorbell had rung so early
and his mother’d called to him up the stairs, he had known, and a
terrible kind of blankness had commenced falling through him.</p>
<p>He told her that he did not know what to do. That he knew if he was
the salesman of it and forced it upon her that was awful and wrong. But
he was trying to understand—they’d prayed on it and talked it through
from every different angle. Lane said how sorry she knew he was, and
that if he was wrong in believing they’d truly decided together when
they decided to make the appointment she should please tell him, because
he thought he knew how she must have felt as it got closer and closer
and how she must be so scared, but that what he couldn’t tell was if it
was more than that. He was totally still except for moving his mouth, it
felt like. She did not reply. That if they needed to pray on it more and
talk it through, then he was here, he was ready, he said. The
appointment could get moved back; if she just said the word they could
call and push it back to take more time to be sure in the decision. It
was still so early in it—they both knew that, he said. This was true,
that he felt this way, and yet he also knew he was also trying to say
things that would get her to open up and say enough back that he could
see her and read her heart and know what to say to get her to go through
with it. He knew this without admitting to himself that this was what he
wanted, for it would make him a hypocrite and liar. He knew, in some
locked-up little part of him, why it was that he’d gone to no one to
open up and seek their life counsel, not Pastor Steve or the prayer
partners at campus ministries, not his UPS friends or the spiritual
counselling available through his parents’ old church. But he did not
know why Sheri herself had not gone to Pastor Steve—he could not read
her heart. She was blank and hidden. He so fervently wished it never
happened. He felt like he knew now why it was a true sin and not just a
leftover rule from past society. He felt like he had been brought low by
it and humbled and now did believe that the rules were there for a
reason. That the rules were concerned with him personally, as an
individual. He promised God he had learned his lesson. But what if that,
too, was a hollow promise, from a hypocrite who repented only after, who
promised submission but really only wanted a reprieve? He might not even
know his own heart or be able to read and know himself. He kept thinking
also of 1 Timothy and the hypocrite therein who disputeth over words. He
felt a terrible inner resistance but could not feel what it was that it
resisted. This was the truth. All the different angles and ways they had
come at the decision together did not ever include it—the word—for had
he once said it, avowed that he did love her, loved Sheri Fisher, then
it all would have been transformed. It would not be a different stance
or angle, but a difference in the very thing they were praying and
deciding on together. Sometimes they had prayed together over the phone,
in a kind of half code in case anybody accidentally picked up the
extension. She continued to sit as if thinking, in the pose of thinking,
like that one statue. They were right up next to each other on the
table. He was looking over past her at the tree in the water. But he
could not say he did: it was not true.</p>
<p>But neither did he ever open up and tell her straight out he did not
love her. This might be his lie by omission. This might be the frozen
resistance—were he to look right at her and tell her he didn’t, she
would keep the appointment and go. He knew this. Something in him,
though, some terrible weakness or lack of values, could not tell her. It
felt like a muscle he did not have. He didn’t know why; he just could
not do it, or even pray to do it. She believed he was good, serious in
his values. Part of him seemed willing to more or less just about lie to
someone with that kind of faith and trust, and what did that make him?
How could such a type of individual even pray? What it really felt like
was a taste of the reality of what might be meant by Hell. Lane Dean had
never believed in Hell as a lake of fire or a loving God consigning
folks to a burning lake of fire—he knew in his heart this was not true.
What he believed in was a living God of compassion and love and the
possibility of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ through whom
this love was enacted in human time. But sitting here beside this girl
as unknown to him now as outer space, waiting for whatever she might say
to unfreeze him, now he felt like he could see the edge or outline of
what a real vision of Hell might be. It was of two great and terrible
armies within himself, opposed and facing each other, silent. There
would be battle but no victor. Or never a battle—the armies would stay
like that, motionless, looking across at each other, and seeing therein
something so different and alien from themselves that they could not
understand, could not hear each other’s speech as even words or read
anything from what their face looked like, frozen like that, opposed and
uncomprehending, for all human time. Two-hearted, a hypocrite to
yourself either way.</p>
<p>When he moved his head, a part of the lake further out flashed with
sun—the water up close wasn’t black now, and you could see into the
shallows and see that all the water was moving but gently, this way and
that—and in this same way he besought to return to himself as Sheri
moved her leg and started to turn beside him. He could see the man in
the suit and gray hat standing motionless now at the lake’s rim, holding
something under one arm and looking across at the opposite side where a
row of little forms on camp chairs sat in a way that meant they had
lines in the water for crappie—which mostly only your blacks from the
East Side ever did—and the little white shape at the row’s end a
Styrofoam creel. In his moment or time at the lake now just to come,
Lane Dean first felt he could take this all in whole: everything seemed
distinctly lit, for the circle of the pin oak’s shade had rotated off
all the way, and they sat now in sun with their shadow a two-headed
thing in the grass before them. He was looking or gazing again at where
the downed tree’s branches seemed to all bend so sharply just under the
shallows’ surface when he was given to know that through all this frozen
silence he’d despised he had, in truth, been praying, or some little
part of his heart he could not hear had, for he was answered now with a
type of vision, what he would later call within his own mind a vision or
moment of grace. He was not a hypocrite, just broken and split off like
all men. Later on, he believed that what happened was he’d had a moment
of almost seeing them both as Jesus saw them—as blind but groping,
wanting to please God despite their inborn fallen nature. For in that
same given moment he saw, quick as light, into Sheri’s heart, and was
made to know what would occur here as she finished turning to him and
the man in the hat watched the fishing and the downed elm shed cells
into the water. This down-to-earth girl that smelled good and wanted to
be a nurse would take and hold one of his hands in both of hers to
unfreeze him and make him look at her, and she would say that she cannot
do it. That she is sorry she did not know this sooner, that she hadn’t
meant to lie—she agreed because she’d wanted to believe that she could,
but she cannot. That she will carry this and have it; she has to. With
her gaze clear and steady. That all night last night she prayed and
searched inside herself and decided this is what love commands of her.
That Lane should please please sweetie let her finish. That listen—this
is her own decision and obliges him to nothing. That she knows he does
not love her, not that way, has known it all this time, and that it’s
all right. That it is as it is and it’s all right. She will carry this,
and have it, and love it and make no claim on Lane except his good
wishes and respecting what she has to do. That she releases him, all
claim, and hopes he finishes up at P.J.C. and does so good in his life
and has all joy and good things. Her voice will be clear and steady, and
she will be lying, for Lane has been given to read her heart. To see
through her. One of the opposite side’s blacks raises his arm in what
may be greeting, or waving off a bee. There is a mower cutting grass
someplace off behind them. It will be a terrible, last-ditch gamble born
out of the desperation in Sheri Fisher’s soul, the knowledge that she
can neither do this thing today nor carry a child alone and shame her
family. Her values blocked the way either way, Lane could see, and she
has no other options or choice—this lie is not a sin. Galatians 4:16,
Have I then become your enemy? She is gambling that he is good. There on
the table, neither frozen nor yet moving, Lane Dean, Jr., sees all this,
and is moved with pity, and also with something more, something without
any name he knows, that is given to him in the form of a question that
never once in all the long week’s thinking and division had even so much
as occurred—why is he so sure he doesn’t love her? Why is one kind of
love any different? What if he has no earthly idea what love is? What
would even Jesus do? For it was just now he felt her two small strong
soft hands on his, to turn him. What if he was just afraid, if the truth
was no more than this, and if what to pray for was not even love but
simple courage, to meet both her eyes as she says it and trust his
heart?</p>
