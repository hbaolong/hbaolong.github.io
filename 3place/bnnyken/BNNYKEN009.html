<h4 id="symbols-and-signs">Symbols and Signs</h4>
<p>By Vladimir Nabokov (1948)</p>
<p>For the fourth time in as many years, they were confronted with the
problem of what birthday present to take to a young man who was
incurably deranged in his mind. Desires he had none. Man-made objects
were to him either hives of evil, vibrant with a malignant activity that
he alone could perceive, or gross comforts for which no use could be
found in his abstract world. After eliminating a number of articles that
might offend him or frighten him (anything in the gadget line, for
instance, was taboo), his parents chose a dainty and innocent trifle—a
basket with ten different fruit jellies in ten little jars.</p>
<p>At the time of his birth, they had already been married for a long
time; a score of years had elapsed, and now they were quite old. Her
drab gray hair was pinned up carelessly. She wore cheap black dresses.
Unlike other women of her age (such as Mrs. Sol, their next-door
neighbor, whose face was all pink and mauve with paint and whose hat was
a cluster of brookside flowers), she presented a naked white countenance
to the faultfinding light of spring. Her husband, who in the old country
had been a fairly successful businessman, was now, in New York, wholly
dependent on his brother Isaac, a real American of almost forty years’
standing. They seldom saw Isaac and had nicknamed him the Prince.</p>
<p>That Friday, their son’s birthday, everything went wrong. The subway
train lost its life current between two stations and for a quarter of an
hour they could hear nothing but the dutiful beating of their hearts and
the rustling of newspapers. The bus they had to take next was late and
kept them waiting a long time on a street corner, and when it did come,
it was crammed with garrulous high-school children. It began to rain as
they walked up the brown path leading to the sanitarium. There they
waited again, and instead of their boy, shuffling into the room, as he
usually did (his poor face sullen, confused, ill-shaven, and blotched
with acne), a nurse they knew and did not care for appeared at last and
brightly explained that he had again attempted to take his life. He was
all right, she said, but a visit from his parents might disturb him. The
place was so miserably understaffed, and things got mislaid or mixed up
so easily, that they decided not to leave their present in the office
but to bring it to him next time they came.</p>
<p>Outside the building, she waited for her husband to open his umbrella
and then took his arm. He kept clearing his throat, as he always did
when he was upset. They reached the bus-stop shelter on the other side
of the street and he closed his umbrella. A few feet away, under a
swaying and dripping tree, a tiny unfledged bird was helplessly
twitching in a puddle.</p>
<p>During the long ride to the subway station, she and her husband did
not exchange a word, and every time she glanced at his old hands,
clasped and twitching upon the handle of his umbrella, and saw their
swollen veins and brown-spotted skin, she felt the mounting pressure of
tears. As she looked around, trying to hook her mind onto something, it
gave her a kind of soft shock, a mixture of compassion and wonder, to
notice that one of the passengers—a girl with dark hair and grubby red
toenails—was weeping on the shoulder of an older woman. Whom did that
woman resemble? She resembled Rebecca Borisovna, whose daughter had
married one of the Soloveichiks—in Minsk, years ago.</p>
<p>The last time the boy had tried to do it, his method had been, in the
doctor’s words, a masterpiece of inventiveness; he would have succeeded
had not an envious fellow-patient thought he was learning to fly and
stopped him just in time. What he had really wanted to do was to tear a
hole in his world and escape.</p>
<p>The system of his delusions had been the subject of an elaborate
paper in a scientific monthly, which the doctor at the sanitarium had
given to them to read. But long before that, she and her husband had
puzzled it out for themselves. “Referential mania,” the article had
called it. In these very rare cases, the patient imagines that
everything happening around him is a veiled reference to his personality
and existence. He excludes real people from the conspiracy, because he
considers himself to be so much more intelligent than other men.
Phenomenal nature shadows him wherever he goes. Clouds in the staring
sky transmit to each other, by means of slow signs, incredibly detailed
information regarding him. His inmost thoughts are discussed at
nightfall, in manual alphabet, by darkly gesticulating trees. Pebbles or
stains or sun flecks form patterns representing, in some awful way,
messages that he must intercept. Everything is a cipher and of
everything he is the theme. All around him, there are spies. Some of
them are detached observers, like glass surfaces and still pools;
others, such as coats in store windows, are prejudiced witnesses,
lynchers at heart; others, again (running water, storms), are hysterical
to the point of insanity, have a distorted opinion of him, and
grotesquely misinterpret his actions. He must be always on his guard and
devote every minute and module of life to the decoding of the undulation
of things. The very air he exhales is indexed and filed away. If only
the interest he provokes were limited to his immediate surroundings,
but, alas, it is not! With distance, the torrents of wild scandal
increase in volume and volubility. The silhouettes of his blood
corpuscles, magnified a million times, flit over vast plains; and still
farther away, great mountains of unbearable solidity and height sum up,
in terms of granite and groaning firs, the ultimate truth of his
being.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>When they emerged from the thunder and foul air of the subway, the
last dregs of the day were mixed with the street lights. She wanted to
buy some fish for supper, so she handed him the basket of jelly jars,
telling him to go home. Accordingly, he returned to their tenement
house, walked up to the third landing, and then remembered he had given
her his keys earlier in the day.</p>
<p>In silence he sat down on the steps and in silence rose when, some
ten minutes later, she came trudging heavily up the stairs, smiling
wanly and shaking her head in deprecation of her silliness. They entered
their two-room flat and he at once went to the mirror. Straining the
corners of his mouth apart by means of his thumbs, with a horrible,
mask-like grimace, he removed his new, hopelessly uncomfortable dental
plate. He read his Russian-language newspaper while she laid the table.
Still reading, he ate the pale victuals that needed no teeth. She knew
his moods and was also silent.</p>
<p>When he had gone to bed, she remained in the living room with her
pack of soiled playing cards and her old photograph albums. Across the
narrow courtyard, where the rain tinkled in the dark against some ash
cans, windows were blandly alight, and in one of them a black-trousered
man, with his hands clasped under his head and his elbows raised, could
he seen lying supine on an untidy bed. She pulled the blind down and
examined the photographs. As a baby, he looked more surprised than most
babies. A photograph of a German maid they had had in Leipzig and her
fat-faced fiancé fell out of a fold of the album. She turned the pages
of the book: Minsk, the Revolution, Leipzig, Berlin, Leipzig again, a
slanting house front, badly out of focus. Here was the boy when he was
four years old, in a park, shyly, with puckered forehead, looking away
from an eager squirrel, as he would have from any other stranger. Here
was Aunt Rosa, a fussy, angular, wild-eyed old lady, who had lived in a
tremulous world of bad news, bankruptcies, train accidents, and
cancerous growths until the Germans put her to death, together with all
the people she had worried about. The boy, aged six—that was when he
drew wonderful birds with human hands and feet, and suffered from
insomnia like a grown-up man. His cousin, now a famous chess player. The
boy again, aged about eight, already hard to understand, afraid of the
wallpaper in the passage, afraid of a certain picture in a book, which
merely showed an idyllic landscape with rocks on a hillside and an old
cart wheel hanging from the one branch of a leafless tree. Here he was
at ten—the year they left Europe. She remembered the shame, the pity,
the humiliating difficulties of the journey, and the ugly, vicious,
backward children he was with in the special school where he had been
placed after they arrived in America. And then came a time in his life,
coinciding with a long convalescence after pneumonia, when those little
phobias of his, which his parents had stubbornly regarded as the
eccentricities of a prodigiously gifted child, hardened, as it were,
into a dense tangle of logically interacting illusions, making them
totally inaccessible to normal minds.</p>
<p>All this, and much more, she had accepted, for, after all, living
does mean accepting the loss of one joy after another, not even joys in
her case, mere possibilities of improvement. She thought of the
recurrent waves of pain that for some reason or other she and her
husband had had to endure; of the invisible giants hurting her boy in
some unimaginable fashion; of the incalculable amount of tenderness
contained in the world; of the fate of this tenderness, which is either
crushed or wasted, or transformed into madness; of neglected children
humming to themselves in unswept corners; of beautiful weeds that cannot
hide from the farmer.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight when, from the living room, she heard her
husband moan, and presently he staggered in, wearing over his nightgown
the old overcoat with the astrakhan collar that he much preferred to his
nice blue bathrobe.</p>
<p>“I can’t sleep!” he cried.</p>
<p>“Why can’t you sleep?” she asked. “You were so tired.”</p>
<p>“I can’t sleep because I am dying,” he said, and lay down on the
couch.</p>
<p>“Is it your stomach? Do you want me to call Dr. Solov?”</p>
<p>“No doctors, no doctors,” he moaned. “To the devil with doctors! We
must get him out of there quick. Otherwise, we’ll be responsible….
Responsible!” He hurled himself into a sitting position, both feet on
the floor, thumping his forehead with his clenched fist.</p>
<p>“All right,” she said quietly. “We will bring him home tomorrow
morning.”</p>
<p>“I would like some tea,” said her husband and went out to the
bathroom.</p>
<p>Bending with difficulty, she retrieved some playing cards and a
photograph or two that had slipped to the floor—the knave of hearts, the
nine of spades, the ace of spades, the maid Elsa and her bestial beau.
He returned in high spirits, saying in a loud voice, “I have it all
figured out. We will give him the bedroom. Each of us will spend part of
the night near him and the other part on this couch. We will have the
doctor see him at least twice a week. It does not matter what the Prince
says. He won’t have much to say anyway, because it will come out
cheaper.”</p>
<p>The telephone rang. It was an unusual hour for it to ring. He stood
in the middle of the room, groping with his foot for one slipper that
had come off, and childishly, toothlessly, gaped at his wife. Since she
knew more English than he, she always attended to the calls.</p>
<p>“Can I speak to Charlie?” a girl’s dull little voice said to her
now.</p>
<p>“What number do you want?…No. You have the wrong number.”</p>
<p>She put the receiver down gently and her hand went to her heart. “It
frightened me,” she said.</p>
<p>He smiled a quick smile and immediately resumed his excited
monologue. They would fetch him as soon as it was day. For his own
protection, they would keep all the knives in a locked drawer. Even at
his worst, he presented no danger to other people.</p>
<p>The telephone rang a second time.</p>
<p>The same toneless, anxious young voice asked for Charlie.</p>
<p>“You have the incorrect number. I will tell you what you are doing.
You are turning the letter ‘o’ instead of the zero.” She hung up
again.</p>
<p>They sat down to their unexpected, festive midnight tea. He sipped
noisily; his face was flushed; every now and then he raised his glass
with a circular motion, so as to make the sugar dissolve more
thoroughly. The vein on the side of his bald head stood out
conspicuously, and silvery bristles showed on his chin. The birthday
present stood on the table. While she poured him another glass of tea,
he put on his spectacles and reëxamined with pleasure the luminous
yellow, green, and red little jars. His clumsy, moist lips spelled out
their eloquent labels—apricot, grape, beach plum, quince. He had got to
crab apple when the telephone rang again.</p>
