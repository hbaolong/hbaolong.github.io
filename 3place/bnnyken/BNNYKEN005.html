<h4 id="such-a-pretty-day">Such a Pretty Day</h4>
<p>By Dawn Powell (1939)</p>
<p>As soon as Dave had put the pen in the yard and waved good-bye to the
baby, Sylvia got on the phone.</p>
<p>“Hello, Barbs. Scotty gone yet?…Listen, Barbs, Dave says they’re
working overtime this noon, so he won’t be home for lunch…. Scotty, too,
eh? Listen, Barbs, it’s such a pretty day, I thought we might go to the
city. You bring the kids over and I’ll get Frieda…. Yes, I know she’s a
brat and she’ll tell the whole neighborhood, but she’s good with the
kids. Listen, don’t say anything. My God, Dave’d kill me. You heard what
he said last Sunday—if he caught me thumbing again he’d get a divorce?
Listen, he means it. You come on over, Barbs…. O.K., Barbs…. Oh, I’m
goin’ to wear my play suit…. Your linen? Why don’t you wear your play
suit? It looks kinda cute on you…. Oh, come on, Barbs, I’m going to….
O.K., Barbs. The baby’s yelling. ’Bye.”</p>
<p>Sylvia ran into the bedroom and whisked up the beds. She snatched up
newspapers, toys, Dave’s pajamas, a ten-cent double boiler with some
petrified oatmeal in it, and tossed them all in the closet. That was one
thing about having your own house; your mother couldn’t be nagging at
you to do things her way all the time. Sylvia couldn’t get over the
thrill of her own house. Five whole rooms, just for her and Dave and the
baby. Never had even one room to herself before she was married. Darn it
all, she was happy. Let ’em talk. Her own mother was married at sixteen,
too, wasn’t she? Supposing she’d sat around and finished school, what
then? She could have a job in the factory and get up every morning at
six-thirty like Gladys Chalk, instead of lying around her own house all
day in a nightgown. She could sit around waiting for some guy to call
her up, and God knows there weren’t enough boys in town to go around,
instead of having a nice fellow like Dave all sewed up permanently. So
maybe Sylvia wasn’t so dumb as her folks said. So what?</p>
<p>Mrs. Peters was in the back yard fooling with the baby when Sylvia
went out, and that was all right, because she could ask her about
Frieda.</p>
<p>“You look about ten years old in those overalls,” said Mrs. Peters.
“I should think youda put on more weight being married two years
already. I wouldn’t take you for more’n twelve at the most.”</p>
<p>“No cracks,” said Sylvia coldly. “I was nineteen last Tuesday. Did
you see the toaster Dave got me? We don’t eat much toast, but I have to
make a lot ’cause it makes the baby laugh so the way the toast jumps
out.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that installment plan is good for young folks,” said
Mrs. Peters, as if it was any of her business, but Sylvia took it
because she wanted Frieda.</p>
<p>“How else you going to get anything on eighteen a week, Mrs. Peters?”
she merely asked. “Look, Mrs. Peters, could Frieda come over today and
look after Davie? I got a chance to go to the city—there’s a picture I
want to see at the Majestic.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Peters blew out her cheeks, and Davie laughed and squealed with
joy. He was a good baby. Even Mrs. Peters had to say so.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t run around the way you do when I was raising a family,”
said Mrs. Peters. “If it wasn’t washing, it was canning or berrying or
helping in Mr. Peters’ store.”</p>
<p>All right, we’ll go into that, then. The trouble with those old
married women was they thought they had a racket all to themselves and
they didn’t like pretty young girls breaking into it.</p>
<p>“Tell Frieda she can make a cake if she wants, too,” Sylvia conceded.
“There’s flour and chocolate, and she can run the radio for a
while.”</p>
<p>“If it’s that Barbara friend of yours you’re going with,” said
Mrs. Peters, “I wouldn’t let any daughter of mine run around with her.
Her folks are nothing but trash. There hasn’t ever been a Moller that
amounted to a stick in this town. Frieda says she saw six beer bottles
in the sink there one morning.”</p>
<p>“Barbs and Scotty are Dave’s and my best friends,” said Sylvia in her
best missus voice, and was that a lie, with Dave half the time saying
just what Mrs. Peters was saying! “Tell Frieda to come about eleven. We
want to get a good start.”</p>
<p>Barbs walked in, wheeling the twins. They were not quite a year old
but were big babies, like Davie, and made Barbs look like a school kid,
which she probably should have been, but keeping house was a lot more
fun. You could say what you liked about Barbs, maybe she did run wild
until Scotty and the twins kinda settled her, but you had to hand it to
her—she kept that dinky apartment of hers spick-and-span. “Maybe,”
Sylvia always said, looking around the trim little suite over the
butcher shop, “if I only had three rooms instead of a whole house I
could get interested, too.”</p>
<p>Frieda came over at ten minutes to eleven. She wore thick glasses
over her slightly crossed eyes and her former pigtails had been
miraculously transformed into a kinky, tangled mass.</p>
<p>“I got a permanent,” she said proudly.</p>
<p>Both Barbs and Sylvia were crazy for permanents, so they were silent
for a moment in envious awe.</p>
<p>“I don’t like permanents on kids,” said Barbs haughtily.</p>
<p>“Everybody in my Sunday-school class has one,” said Frieda,
unperturbed. “My mother says it’s a hundred-per-cent improvement. My
mother’s making me a play suit too. Where you going? To the city? I
thought Dave told you not to thumb any more, Sylvia.”</p>
<p>“Listen to the brat,” said Barbs. “Do you run this town, Miss
Wisie?”</p>
<p>“You better be careful or I won’t take care of your old twins,” said
Frieda. “Can I really make a cake, Sylvia?”</p>
<p>Sylvia motioned Barbs into the house, and they went in to whisper
ways of getting out to the turnpike without Frieda’s being able to tell.
Scotty didn’t like Barbs’ hitching any more than Dave liked Sylvia’s,
because everybody in the town talked enough anyway, and she was a
married woman now and ought to know better.</p>
<p>At first Sylvia thought it was because Scotty was older—he was
twenty-seven—and more settled—he’d worked in the factory since he was
twelve—but then Dave, who was just twenty, got to talking that way, too.
They didn’t want their wives hiking around the state like a couple of
tramps, they both said. You didn’t see the Hull girls doing it, did you?
Or Dody Crane?</p>
<p>“The Hull girls and Dody Crane! Can you imagine?” Sylvia repeated in
indignation. “Why should they? They got their own cars, and Dody’s dad
is rich.”</p>
<p>At that, Sylvia had nothing against Dody. The Hull girls were snobs
because they’d gone away to boarding school while Sylvia and Barbs were
plugging through public school, but Dody was all right; she always spoke
to Sylvia, and once Dave had taken her to a dance. She wouldn’t let him
kiss her, so he married Sylvia instead and promoted Dody to be his
ideal. Sylvia got kind of sick always being pecked at to do things the
way Dody would do them. That was the only thing. But Dody was all right.
She sent the baby a cute blanket once.</p>
<p>Barbs stuck the twins’ bottles in the icebox and Frieda put all the
babies in the pen. She was a fat little girl, but that wasn’t the only
reason nobody loved her. She pulled out a campstool from behind the tool
shed and sat down on it on the grass with a book.</p>
<p>“I’ll read to them for a while,” she said, “from the Bible.”</p>
<p>The three fat little babies, clad in nothing but their G-strings,
stared at Frieda, rather pleased with her glasses.</p>
<p>“They’ll love that,” said Sylvia, and she and Barbs sneaked out the
front way, past the garage, to the pike.</p>
<p>They walked sedately enough past the straggling houses, and tried not
to look up at tempting cars shooting past, because you couldn’t tell
yet; it might be somebody from the factory, who would tell the boys. A
roadster with two men in it slowed up and one of them yelled, “Hi,
Crawford,” but the girls dared not look up yet.</p>
<p>“You know, Sylvia, you do look kinda like Joan Crawford,” said Barbs,
studying Sylvia critically. “Somebody else, I forget who, said so. Me,
I’m more the Merle Oberon type.”</p>
<p>“You got freckles, too, if that’s what you mean,” said Sylvia.</p>
<p>A blue sedan drove slowly past, and Barbs nudged Sylvia. It was the
Hull sisters on their way to the country club. They stared at the two
girls and Barbs and Sylvia stared insolently back. Then Dody Crane’s car
came along, Dody driving with her mother, two golf bags sticking out of
the side. Dody nodded and Sylvia nodded back.</p>
<p>“Imagine a girl that old running around all the time with her old
lady,” said Barbs, who after all had been ignored by Dody.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Now they were past the club road and on the main highway. They
stopped and began working. It never took them long, because they were a
couple of good-looking girls, as they well knew, and even women weren’t
afraid of being held up by such a nice little pair. This time it was a
woman in a big Cadillac. She was a thin, browned woman with iron-gray
hair, and she drove like a house afire. Some fun! They were in the heart
of the city in less than an hour.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the show right away,” suggested Sylvia.</p>
<p>Everybody looked at the two bareheaded girls, in their red play
suits, wandering through the business section. Barbs stopped short
suddenly.</p>
<p>“Listen, Sylvia, I only got fifteen cents.”</p>
<p>“But I told you we would go to the Majestic,” said Sylvia, annoyed.
“You know it’s twenty.”</p>
<p>“Well, I just don’t have it,” said Barbs, doggedly. “I guess you
wouldn’t have it, either, if you had two kids instead of one and your
husband had to fork over two bucks a week to his mother.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t she get on relief?” complained Sylvia. “Dave’s mother
did.”</p>
<p>“Dave’s mother is in another town,” said Barbs. “And anyway Scotty
don’t like the idea. So I only got fifteen cents.”</p>
<p>Sylvia was furious.</p>
<p>“I go to work and get Frieda for us and let her mess up my kitchen
baking a cake, and now you don’t have twenty cents for a show. Barbs,
honestly, you’re a lousy sport. Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
<p>Barbs was sullen.</p>
<p>“I wanted to get outa town for five minutes, show or no show.”</p>
<p>Sylvia counted her money. Thirty-seven cents.</p>
<p>“You go alone, and I’ll look around the stores,” said Barbs.</p>
<p>It ended with their each buying a Frojoy at a corner stand for lunch
and then going on a shopping tour. They went through Schwab’s because
Barbs dared Sylvia to go in. This was a large, cool, dark, swanky store,
and so snooty that Barbs and Sylvia clutched each other’s hand to keep
up their courage before the hostile clerks.</p>
<p>“This is where Dody gets all her clothes,” said Sylvia. “Except the
ones she gets in New York.”</p>
<p>“A lot of good it does her,” said Barbs. “I’ll bet she’d give her
eye-teeth to be married and have kids like we have. She played with
dolls longer than any of us. She had the first mamma doll in town.”</p>
<p>“I wish I had a little girl,” said Sylvia. “I’d get her a mamma
doll.”</p>
<p>“I’d get her a Quint Set doll,” said Barbs, and that reminded her
they must go to the Variety store next.</p>
<p>Schwab’s doors swung thankfully behind them.</p>
<p>“Even if I had money, I wouldn’t buy clothes in that lousy store,”
said Barbs. “Their styles are all hick. They’ve got braid on everything.
Look!”</p>
<p>A window display of garden furniture, complete with sand, pool,
umbrellas, and mint juleps, held them spellbound. Life-size
velvety-lashed ladies in garden frocks sat in swings and deck chairs in
attitudes of rigid enjoyment. A rosy, wall-eyed athlete in shorts
relaxed on a tennis roller. Two beaming little boys in bathing suits sat
stiffly on a rubber dolphin in the pool.</p>
<p>“I could get the twins bathing suits and one of those false fish,”
said Barbs. “I’d fill the old tank on the roof with water.”</p>
<p>“Like a penthouse,” said Sylvia.</p>
<p>They walked on silently to the big Variety store, Sylvia busy putting
the fish and Davie in a bathing suit somewhere around her own premises,
and Barbs thinking about the tank. The Variety store was more hospitable
than Schwab’s. A radio was on, and a girl at the piano counter, in a
pink sharkskin sports dress, was playing and singing “I Never Knew
Heaven Could Speak.”</p>
<p>“Say, if I couldn’t sing better than that,” muttered Barbs.</p>
<p>“It’s my favorite song, too,” said Sylvia. “But don’t she ruin
it?”</p>
<p>They hummed it softly, looking over the counters.</p>
<p>“I’ll bet we could sing over the radio if we practiced more,” said
Sylvia. “Honestly, Barbs, even Dave thinks we’re good.”</p>
<p>“Ah, nuts!” said Barbs. “Nobody’s going to let us do anything ever.
Wish I had my hands on that two bucks we sent off to Scotty’s Mom right
now.”</p>
<p>“I could let you have ten cents, maybe,” said Sylvia, relenting, but
just then her eye caught something and she added, “Still, you got ten of
your own, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>Barbs saw what Sylvia saw. It was a baby’s bathing suit for
twenty-nine cents. Probably it was only fair. After all, Sylvia did have
thirty-two cents and only one baby.</p>
<p>“Now, you only got three cents,” was all Barbs said when the girl
gave Sylvia the package. Sylvia unwrapped it right away and held it up.
It was bright red, with a little white belt. It was the cutest
thing.</p>
<p>“I’d rather have had the striped ones like the ones in the window,”
said Barbs, but Sylvia read the envy in her voice and grinned.</p>
<p>At the next counter were spades and beach pails, and here Barbs was
as lost as Sylvia, because she had to buy two or nothing, so ten cents
was no good. At the foot of the counter were rubber floats, and one was
a dolphin almost like the one in the window. It was a dollar
ninety-eight and it came in a box; you blew it up. Sylvia and Barbs
stared at it.</p>
<p>“Kids don’t need bathing suits on a roof,” said Barbs. “I can fill
that old tank anyway.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” said Sylvia.</p>
<p>“You can bring Davie up to play in it, too,” said Barbs, generously.
“But he won’t need that suit.”</p>
<p>“That’ll be fun,” said Sylvia. Twenty-nine cents wasted.</p>
<p>They could not take their eyes off the sample dolphin.</p>
<p>“He’d hold two, wouldn’t he?” said Barbs.</p>
<p>“Sure—three, even,” giggled Sylvia.</p>
<p>She almost knew what Barbs was going to do, and yet in a way you
could have knocked her down with a feather. The minute the clerk walked
off to the next counter, Barbs had snitched one of the rubber things out
of its box and stuffed it down her front. Nothing happened. Nobody
screamed. Nobody grabbed them. Barbs looked at Sylvia, and Sylvia’s
mouth moved helplessly.</p>
<p>“W-w-w-well,” said Barbs, “I g-g-g-uess we’d b-b-etter be g-g-g-going
to the M-m-m-ajestic.”</p>
<p>They walked slowly out of the store. A man in a Panama hat watched
them from the radio counter, but he couldn’t be anything but a customer.
The girl at the bathing-suit counter watched them.</p>
<p>“She saw,” gasped Barbs. “Just as I popped it in, I saw her looking,
but it was too late to yank it out then. Look—I’m afraid to—is anybody
following?”</p>
<p>Sylvia was afraid, too. They walked in slow agony down the street.
Someone was behind them. Out of the corner of her eye Sylvia saw it was
the man in the Panama hat. He grinned. Sylvia grew red. Barbs clutched
her arm frantically.</p>
<p>“Let’s get a hitch, quick,” she whispered. “We got to go home
now.”</p>
<p>“But it’s only two o’clock,” said Sylvia. “Anyway, if somebody’s
watching from the store, they’ll see us.”</p>
<p>“Oh—oh, what’ll we do,” whispered Barbs. “Does it show?”</p>
<p>Sylvia giggled.</p>
<p>“No, you only look like Aunt Jemima, that’s all.”</p>
<p>Barbs was looking up and down the street for a possible hitch. The
man in the Panama hat was getting into a Chevrolet coupé. He grinned
again, and imperceptibly winked. Barbs and Sylvia walked up to him.
Before they spoke, two men in shirtsleeves from the Variety came out on
the sidewalk, and with one accord the girls climbed into his car. He
slammed the door and drove quickly around the corner.</p>
<p>“Oh, gee!” breathed Barbs. “Oh thanks!”</p>
<p>The man was a swarthy, foreign-looking fellow, with a candy-striped
shirt and a diamond ring.</p>
<p>“I got the idea,” he said.</p>
<p>Nobody said anything more till they were outside the city limits, and
then Sylvia noticed they were not going in the direction of home.</p>
<p>“Albany’s my next stop,” said the driver. He turned to Barbs. “That
wasn’t your first job there in the store, was it, sugar?”</p>
<p>Barbs looked blank.</p>
<p>“Don’t act so innocent,” he said, laughing. “I knew what you girls
were up to as soon as I saw those red outfits. But you’d better not work
that store again. They’ve got you down now. For that matter, you’d
better leave that town alone a while.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Sylvia, with dignity,
“and anyway we’re not going in this direction.”</p>
<p>“What do you say going to Albany with me and then on to New York? A
couple of girls like you could clean up a thousand dollars a week—just
the big stores, understand, nice merchandise, not ordinary snatching. I
could send you straight up to a friend of mine on 135th Street and you’d
be treated right. A couple of nice kids like you could get away with
murder. What do you want to waste your time stealing bathing suits and
rubber gadgets?”</p>
<p>“I bought this bathing suit,” said Sylvia angrily.</p>
<p>“Why,” gasped Barbs, “you don’t think we’re thieves?”</p>
<p>The girls looked at each other in growing horror at his sardonic
laugh.</p>
<p>“Of course you’re not thieves, honey,” he chuckled. “You was just
taking what you liked, that was all. Don’t kid me, sister, you’re a
smart girl—both of you, for that matter. You got talent; you could do
big stuff, I’m telling you. I did you a favor today. Why don’t you do me
a favor now and try out the big time? You could wire your folks.”</p>
<p>“We’re married women,” said Sylvia. “Our husbands would come after
us.”</p>
<p>“Think it over,” said the driver, good-humoredly. “You might give me
your names and I’ll drop you a card, reminding you where to get in touch
if you change your mind.” He pulled a silver pencil out of his pocket
and a card.</p>
<p>“Dody Crane,” said Sylvia.</p>
<p>“Teresa Hull,” quavered Barbs.</p>
<p>“Well, Dody and Terry, you’ll hear from me,” he said, and slowed up
near a filling station. “You’re the best talent I’ve seen in these
parts. All you need is training and a little protection.”</p>
<p>At the filling station, he got out and went inside. Without a word
Sylvia and Barbs slipped out and ran to the road, hiding in the bushes
along the way. They saw him come back out, look for them briefly, and
question the mechanic. Then, with a shake of his head, he got in and
drove off. Barbs and Sylvia looked at each other and drew a great breath
of relief.</p>
<p>“I never was so scared,” said Barbs. “Believe me, I’ll never swipe
anything again.”</p>
<p>“I should hope not,” said Sylvia.</p>
<p>Barbs pulled the rubber out of her dress and began to blow it up.
Sylvia watched. Barbs’ face grew redder and redder, and the fish grew
bigger and bigger. It was bigger than the one in the window. It would
easily seat the twins and Davie, all three. Then Barbs’ face grew
worried; she took the fish away from her mouth.</p>
<p>“I forgot to take the darned stopper,” she panted, and tears stood in
her eyes. “Oh, darn! Oh, Sylvia!”</p>
<p>“Maybe a piece of paper,” suggested Sylvia, but the fish collapsed,
dwindled to nothing. Barbs looked down at it in the middle of the ditch
in disgust.</p>
<p>“I would forget the stopper,” she said. “I’d have to forget the most
important thing.”</p>
<p>“Honestly, Barbs, you may keep your house better than I do, but
you’re dumb about lots of things,” said Sylvia. “This is the last I go
with her,” she thought. “I didn’t even get to see ‘Dark Victory.’ ”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>An empty ice truck drove along, and Sylvia and Barbs jerked their
thumbs. The car slowed down and they climbed in among the burlap bags in
the back, where a young man in a bathing suit and dirty white slacks
sat, fiddling with a harmonica. The girls settled themselves in the
corner opposite him.</p>
<p>“I still got ten cents,” Barbs said.</p>
<p>The car jolted them along the country roads, past cornfields and
waving wheat.</p>
<p>“Hi, Crawford!” the boy said to Sylvia.</p>
<p>The girls looked at each other and laughed.</p>
<p>“What’s that you’re chewing?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Bubble gum,” said Sylvia, and snapped it.</p>
<p>He said nothing more, but stared at them as he played his harmonica.
Barbs and Sylvia sang while he played their favorite piece, “I Never
Knew Heaven Could Speak.” They sang all the way home. The boy and the
truck-driver both said they ought to be on the radio or, at the very
least, the stage.</p>
