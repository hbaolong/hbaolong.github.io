<h4 id="children-are-bored-on-sunday">Children Are Bored on Sunday</h4>
<p>By Jean Stafford (1948)</p>
<p>Through the wide doorway between two of the painting galleries, Emma
saw Alfred Eisenburg standing before “The Three Miracles of Zenobius,”
his lean, equine face ashen and sorrowing, his gaunt frame looking
undernourished, and dressed in a way that showed he was poorer this year
than he had been last. Emma herself had been hunting for the Botticelli
all afternoon, sidetracked first by a Mantegna she had forgotten, and
then by a follower of Hieronymus Bosch, and distracted, in an English
room as she was passing through, by the hot invective of two ladies who
were lodged (so they bitterly reminded one another) in an outrageous and
expensive mare’s-nest at a hotel on Madison. Emma liked Alfred, and
once, at a party in some other year, she had flirted with him slightly
for seven or eight minutes. It had been spring, and even into that
modern apartment, wherever it had been, while the cunning guests, on
their guard and highly civilized, learnedly disputed on aesthetic and
political subjects, the feeling of spring had boldly invaded, adding its
nameless, sentimental sensations to all the others of the buffeted
heart; one did not know and never had, even in the devouring raptures of
adolescence, whether this was a feeling of tension or of
solution—whether one flew or drowned.</p>
<p>In another year, she would have been pleased to run into Alfred here
in the Metropolitan on a cold Sunday, when the galleries were thronged
with out-of-towners and with people who dutifully did something
self-educating on the day of rest. But this year she was hiding from
just such people as Alfred Eisenburg, and she turned quickly to go back
the way she had come, past the Constables and Raeburns. As she turned,
she came face to face with Salvador Dalí, whose sudden countenance, with
its unlikely mustache and its histrionic eyes, familiar from the
photographs in public places, momentarily stopped her dead, for she did
not immediately recognize him and, still surprised by seeing Eisenburg,
took him also to be someone she knew. She shuddered and then realized
that he was merely famous, and she penetrated the heart of a guided tour
and proceeded safely through the rooms until she came to the balcony
that overlooks the medieval armor, and there she paused, watching two
youths of high-school age examine the joints of an equestrian’s
shell.</p>
<p>She paused because she could not decide what to look at now that she
had been denied the Botticelli. She wondered, rather crossly, why Alfred
Eisenburg was looking at it and why, indeed, he was here at all. She
feared that her afternoon, begun in such a burst of courage, would not
be what it might have been; for this second’s glimpse of him—who had no
bearing on her life—might very well divert her from the pictures, not
only because she was reminded of her ignorance of painting by the
presence of someone who was (she assumed) versed in it but because her
eyesight was now bound to be impaired by memory and conjecture, by the
irrelevant mind-portraits of innumerable people who belonged to
Eisenburg’s milieu. And almost at once, as she had predicted, the air
separating her from the schoolboys below was populated with the images
of composers, of painters, of writers who pronounced judgments, in their
individual argot, on Hindemith, Ernst, Sartre, on Beethoven, Rubens,
Baudelaire, on Stalin and Freud and Kierkegaard, on Toynbee, Frazer,
Thoreau, Franco, Salazar, Roosevelt, Maimonides, Racine, Wallace,
Picasso, Henry Luce, Monsignor Sheen, the Atomic Energy Commission, and
the movie industry. And she saw herself moving, shaky with apprehensions
and Martinis, and with the belligerence of a child who feels himself
laughed at, through the apartments of Alfred Eisenburg’s friends, where
the shelves were filled with everyone from Aristophanes to Ring Lardner,
where the walls were hung with reproductions of Seurat, Titian, Vermeer,
and Klee, and where the record cabinets began with Palestrina and ended
with Copland.</p>
<p>These cocktail parties were a modus vivendi in themselves for which a
new philosophy, a new ethic, and a new etiquette had had to be devised.
They were neither work nor play, and yet they were not at all beside the
point but were, on the contrary, quite indispensable to the spiritual
life of the artists who went to them. It was possible for Emma to see
these occasions objectively, after these many months of abstention from
them, but it was still not possible to understand them, for they were so
special a case, and so unlike any parties she had known at home. The
gossip was different, for one thing, because it was stylized, creative
(integrating the whole of the garrotted, absent friend), and all its
details were precise and all its conceits were Jamesian, and all its
practitioners sorrowfully saw themselves in the role of Pontius Pilate,
that hero of the untoward circumstance. (It has to be done, though we
don’t want to do it; ’tis a pity she’s a whore, when no one writes more
intelligent verse than she.) There was, too, the matter of the drinks,
which were much worse than those served by anyone else, and much more
plentiful. They dispensed with the fripperies of olives in Martinis and
cherries in Manhattans (God forbid! They had no sweet teeth), and half
the time there was no ice, and when there was, it was as likely as not
to be suspect shavings got from a bed for shad at the corner fish store.
Other species, so one heard, went off to dinner after cocktail parties
certainly no later than half past eight, but no one ever left a party
given by an Olympian until ten, at the earliest, and then groups went
out together, stalling and squabbling at the door, angrily unable to
come to a decision about where to eat, although they seldom ate once
they got there but, with the greatest formality imaginable, ordered
several rounds of cocktails, as if they had not had a drink in a month
of Sundays. But the most surprising thing of all about these parties was
that every now and again, in the middle of the urgent, general
conversation, this cream of the enlightened was horribly curdled, and an
argument would end, quite literally, in a bloody nose or a black eye.
Emma was always astounded when this happened and continued to think that
these outbursts did not arise out of hatred or jealousy but out of some
quite unaccountable quirk, almost a reflex, almost something physical.
She never quite believed her eyes—that is, was never altogether
convinced that they were really beating one another up. It seemed,
rather, that this was only a deliberate and perfectly honest
demonstration of what might have happened often if they had not so
diligently dedicated themselves to their intellects. Although she had
seen them do it, she did not and could not believe that city people
clipped each other’s jaws, for, to Emma, urban equalled urbane, and
ichor ran in these Augustans’ veins.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>As she looked down now from her balcony at the atrocious iron clothes
below, it occurred to her that Alfred Eisenburg had been just such a
first-generation metropolitan boy as these two who half knelt in lithe
and eager attitudes to study the glittering splints of a knight’s skirt.
It was a kind of childhood she could not imagine and from the thought of
which she turned away in secret, shameful pity. She had been really
stunned when she first came to New York to find that almost no one she
met had gluttonously read Dickens, as she had, beginning at the age of
ten, and because she was only twenty when she arrived in the city and
unacquainted with the varieties of cultural experience, she had acquired
the idea, which she was never able to shake entirely loose, that these
New York natives had been deprived of this and many other innocent
pleasures because they had lived in apartments and not in two- or
three-story houses. (In the early years in New York, she had known
someone who had not heard a cat purr until he was twenty-five and went
to a houseparty on Fire Island.) They had played hide-and-seek dodging
behind ash cans instead of lilac bushes and in and out of the entries of
apartment houses instead of up alleys densely lined with hollyhocks. But
who was she to patronize and pity them? Her own childhood, rich as it
seemed to her on reflection, had not equipped her to read, or to see, or
to listen, as theirs had done; she envied them and despised them at the
same time, and at the same time she feared and admired them. As their
attitude implicitly accused her, before she beat her retreat, she never
looked for meanings, she never saw the literary-historical symbolism of
the cocktail party but went on, despite all testimony to the contrary,
believing it to be an occasion for getting drunk. She never listened,
their manner delicately explained, and when she talked she was always
lamentably off key; often and often she had been stared at and had been
told, “It’s not the same thing at all.”</p>
<p>Emma shuddered, scrutinizing this nature of hers, which they all had
scorned, as if it were some harmless but sickening reptile. Noticing how
cold the marble railing was under her hands, she felt that her
self-blame was surely justified; she came to the Metropolitan Museum not
to attend to the masterpieces but to remember cocktail parties where she
had drunk too much and had seen Alfred Eisenburg, and to watch
schoolboys, and to make experience out of the accidental contact of the
palms of her hands with a cold bit of marble. What was there to do? One
thing, anyhow, was clear and that was that today’s excursion into the
world had been premature; her solitude must continue for a while, and
perhaps it would never end. If the sight of someone so peripheral, so
uninvolving as Alfred Eisenburg could scare her so badly, what would a
cocktail party do? She almost fainted at the thought of it, she almost
fell headlong, and the boys, abandoning the coat of mail, dizzied her by
their progress toward an emblazoned tabard.</p>
<p>In so many words, she wasn’t fit to be seen. Although she was no
longer mutilated, she was still unkempt; her pretensions needed
brushing; her ambiguities needed to be cleaned; her evasions would have
to be completely overhauled before she could face again the terrifying
learning of someone like Alfred Eisenburg, a learning whose components
cohered into a central personality that was called “intellectual.” She
imagined that even the boys down there had opinions on everything
political and artistic and metaphysical and scientific, and because she
remained, in spite of all her opportunities, as green as grass, she was
certain they had got their head start because they had grown up in
apartments, where there was nothing else to do but educate themselves.
This being an intellectual was not the same thing as dilettantism; it
was a calling in itself. Emma, for example, did not even know whether
Eisenburg was a painter, a writer, a composer, a sculptor, or something
entirely different. When, seeing him with the composers, she had thought
he was one of them; when, the next time she met him, at a studio party,
she decided he must be a painter; and when, on subsequent occasions,
everything had pointed toward his being a writer, she had relied
altogether on circumstantial evidence and not on anything he had said or
done. There was no reason to suppose that he had not looked upon her as
the same sort of variable and it made their anonymity to one another
complete. Without the testimony of an impartial third person, neither
she nor Eisenburg would ever know the other’s actual trade. But his
specialty did not matter, for his larger designation was that of “the
intellectual,” just as the man who confines his talents to the nose and
throat is still a doctor. It was, in the light of this, all the more
extraordinary that they had had that lightning-paced flirtation at a
party.</p>
<p>Extraordinary, because Emma could not look upon herself as an
intellectual. Her private antonym of this noun was “rube,” and to her
regret—the regret that had caused her finally to disappear from Alfred’s
group—she was not even a bona-fide rube. In her store clothes, so to
speak, she was often taken for an intellectual, for she had, poor girl,
gone to college and had never been quite the same since. She would not
dare, for instance, go up to Eisenburg now and say that what she most
liked in the Botticelli were the human and compassionate eyes of the
centurions’ horses, which reminded her of the eyes of her own
Great-Uncle Graham, whom she had adored as a child. Nor would she admit
that she was delighted with a Crivelli Madonna because the peaches in
the background looked exactly like marzipan, or that Goya’s little red
boy inspired in her only the pressing desire to go out immediately in
search of a plump cat to stroke. While she knew that feelings like these
were not really punishable, she had not perfected the art of tossing
them off; she was no flirt. She was a bounty jumper in the war between
Great-Uncle Graham’s farm and New York City, and liable to court-martial
on one side and death on the other. Neither staunchly primitive nor
confidently au courant, she rarely knew where she was at. And this was
her Achilles’ heel: her identity was always mistaken, and she was
thought to be an intellectual who, however, had not made the grade. It
was no use now to cry that she was not, that she was a simon-pure rube;
not a soul would believe her. She knew, deeply and with horror, that she
was thought merely stupid.</p>
<p>It was possible to be highly successful as a rube among the
Olympians, and she had seen it done. Someone calling himself Nahum
Mothersill had done it brilliantly, but she often wondered whether his
name had not helped him, and, in fact, she had sometimes wondered
whether that had been his real name. If she had been called, let us say,
Hyacinth Derryberry, she believed she might have been able, as
Mothersill had been, to ask who Ezra Pound was. (This struck her
suddenly as a very important point; it was endearing, really, not to
know who Pound was, but it was only embarrassing to know who he was but
not to have read the “Cantos.”) How different it would have been if
education had not meddled with her rustic nature! Her education had
never dissuaded her from her convictions, but certainly it had ruined
the looks of her mind—painted the poor thing up until it looked like a
mean, hypocritical, promiscuous malcontent, a craven and apologetic
fancy woman. Thus she continued secretly to believe (but never to
confess) that the apple Eve had eaten tasted exactly like those she had
eaten when she was a child visiting on her Great-Uncle Graham’s farm,
and that Newton’s observation was no news in spite of all the hue and
cry. Half the apples she had eaten had fallen out of the tree, whose
branches she had shaken for this very purpose, and the Apple Experience
included both the descent of the fruit and the consumption of it, and
Eve and Newton and Emma understood one another perfectly in this
particular of reality.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Emma started. The Metropolitan boys, who, however bright they were,
would be boys, now caused some steely article of dress to clank, and she
instantly quit the balcony, as if this unseemly noise would attract the
crowd’s attention and bring everyone, including Eisenburg, to see what
had happened. She scuttered like a quarry through the sightseers until
she found an empty seat in front of Rembrandt’s famous frump, “The Noble
Slav”—it was this kind of thing, this fundamental apathy to most of
Rembrandt, that made life in New York such hell for Emma—and there, upon
the plum velours, she realized with surprise that Alfred Eisenburg’s had
been the last familiar face she had seen before she had closed the door
of her tomb.</p>
<p>In September, it had been her custom to spend several hours of each
day walking in a straight line, stopping only for traffic lights and
outlaw taxicabs, in the hope that she would be tired enough to sleep at
night. At five o’clock—and gradually it became more often four o’clock
and then half past three—she would go into a bar, where, while she
drank, she seemed to be reading the information offered by the Sun on
“Where to Dine.” Actually she had ceased to dine long since; every few
days, with effort, she inserted thin wafers of food into her repelled
mouth, flushing the frightful stuff down with enormous drafts of
magical, purifying, fulfilling applejack diluted with tepid water from
the tap. One weighty day, under a sky that grimly withheld the rain, as
if to punish the whole city, she had started out from Ninetieth Street
and had kept going down Madison and was thinking, as she passed the
chancery of St. Patrick’s, that it must be nearly time and that she
needed only to turn east on Fiftieth Street to the New Weston, where the
bar was cool, and dark to an almost absurd degree. And then she was
hailed. She turned quickly, looking in all directions until she saw
Eisenburg approaching, removing a gray pellet of gum from his mouth as
he came. They were both remarkably shy and, at the time, she had thought
they were so because this was the first time they had met since their
brief and blameless flirtation. (How curious it was that she could
scrape off the accretions of the months that had followed and could
remember how she had felt on that spring night—as trembling, as
expectant, as altogether young as if they had sat together underneath a
blooming apple tree.) But now, knowing that her own embarrassment had
come from something else, she thought that perhaps his had, too, and she
connected his awkwardness on that September day with a report she had
had, embedded in a bulletin on everyone, from her sole communicant,
since her retreat, with the Olympian world. This informant had run into
Alfred at a party and had said that he was having a very bad time of it
with a divorce, with poverty, with a tempest that had carried off his
job, and, at last, with a psychoanalyst, whose fees he could not
possibly afford. Perhaps the nightmare had been well under way when they
had met beside the chancery. Without alcohol and without the company of
other people, they had had to be shy or their suffering would have shown
in all its humiliating dishabille. Would it be true still if they should
inescapably meet this afternoon in an Early Flemish room?</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Suddenly, on this common level, in this state of social displacement,
Emma wished to hunt for Alfred and urgently tell him that she hoped it
had not been as bad for him as it had been for her. But naturally she
was not so naïve, and she got up and went purposefully to look at two
Holbeins. They pleased her, as Holbeins always did. The damage, though,
was done, and she did not really see the pictures; Eisenburg’s
hypothetical suffering and her own real suffering blurred the clean
lines and muddied the lucid colors. Between herself and the canvases
swam the months of spreading, cancerous distrust, of anger that made her
seasick, of grief that shook her like an influenza chill, of the
physical afflictions by which the poor victimized spirit sought vainly
to wreck the arrogantly healthy flesh.</p>
<p>Even that one glance at his face, seen from a distance through the
lowing crowd, told her, now that she had repeated it to her mind’s eye,
that his cheeks were drawn and his skin was gray (no soap and water can
ever clean away the grimy look of the sick at heart) and his stance was
tired. She wanted them to go together to some hopelessly disreputable
bar and to console one another in the most maudlin fashion over a
lengthy succession of powerful drinks of whiskey, to compare their
illnesses, to marry their invalid souls for these few hours of painful
communion, and to babble with rapture that they were at last, for a
little while, no longer alone. Only thus, as sick people, could they
marry. In any other terms, it would be a mésalliance, doomed to divorce
from the start, for rubes and intellectuals must stick to their own
class. If only it could take place—this honeymoon of the cripples, this
nuptial consummation of the abandoned—while drinking the delicious amber
whiskey in a joint with a juke box, a stout barkeep, and a handful of
tottering derelicts; if it could take place, would it be possible to
prevent him from marring it all by talking of secondary matters? That
is, of art and neurosis, art and politics, art and science, art and
religion? Could he lay off the fashions of the day and leave his
learning in his private entrepôt? Could he, that is, see the apple fall
and not run madly to break the news to Newton and ask him what on earth
it was all about? Could he, for her sake (for the sake of this pathetic
rube all but weeping for her own pathos in the Metropolitan Museum),
forget the whole dispute and, believing his eyes for a change, admit
that the earth was flat?</p>
<p>It was useless for her now to try to see the paintings. She went,
full of intentions, to the Van Eyck diptych and looked for a long time
at the souls in Hell, kept there by the implacable, impartial, and
genderless angel who stood upon its closing mouth. She looked, in
renewed astonishment, at Jo Davidson’s pink, wrinkled, embalmed head of
Jules Bache, which sat, a trinket on a fluted pedestal, before a Flemish
tapestry. But she was really conscious of nothing but her desire to
leave the museum in the company of Alfred Eisenburg, her cousin-german
in the territory of despair.</p>
<p>So she had to give up, two hours before the closing time, although
she had meant to stay until the end, and she made her way to the central
stairs, which she descended slowly, in disappointment, enviously
observing the people who were going up, carrying collapsible canvas
stools on which they would sit, losing themselves in their contemplation
of the pictures. Salvador Dalí passed her, going quickly down. At the
telephone booths, she hesitated, so sharply lonely that she almost
looked for her address book, and she did take out a nickel, but she put
it back and pressed forlornly forward against the incoming tide.
Suddenly, at the storm doors, she heard a whistle and she turned
sharply, knowing that it would be Eisenburg, as, of course, it was, and
he wore an incongruous smile upon his long, El Greco face. He took her
hand and gravely asked her where she had been all this year and how she
happened to be here, of all places, of all days. Emma replied
distractedly, looking at his seedy clothes, his shaggy hair, the green
cast of his white skin, his deep black eyes, in which all the feelings
were dishevelled, tattered, and held together only by the merest faith
that change had to come. His hand was warm and her own seemed to cling
to it and all their mutual necessity seemed centered here in their
clasped hands. And there was no doubt about it; he had heard of her
collapse and he saw in her face that she had heard of his. Their
recognition of each other was instantaneous and absolute, for they
cunningly saw that they were children and that, if they wished, they
were free for the rest of this winter Sunday to play together, quite
naked, quite innocent. “What a day it is! What a place!” said Alfred
Eisenburg. “Can I buy you a drink, Emma? Have you time?”</p>
<p>She did not accept at once; she guardedly inquired where they could
go from here, for it was an unlikely neighborhood for the sort of place
she wanted. But they were en rapport, and he, wanting to avoid the
grownups as much as she, said they would go across to Lexington. He
needed a drink after an afternoon like this—didn’t she? Oh, Lord, yes,
she did, and she did not question what he meant by “an afternoon like
this” but said that she would be delighted to go, even though they would
have to walk on eggs all the way from the Museum to the place where the
bottle was, the peace pipe on Lexington. Actually, there was nothing to
fear; even if they had heard catcalls, or if someone had hooted at them,
“Intellectual loves Rube!,” they would have been impervious, for the
heart carved in the bark of the apple tree would contain the names Emma
and Alfred, and there were no perquisites to such a conjugation. To her
own heart, which was shaped exactly like a valentine, there came a
winglike palpitation, a delicate exigency, and all the fragrance of all
the flowery springtime love affairs that ever were seemed waiting for
them in the whiskey bottle. To mingle their pain, their handshake had
promised them, was to produce a separate entity, like a child that could
shift for itself, and they scrambled hastily toward this profound and
pastoral experience.</p>
