<h4 id="defender-of-the-faith">Defender of the Faith</h4>
<p>By Philip Roth (1959)</p>
<p>In May of 1945, only a few weeks after the fighting had ended in
Europe, I was rotated back to the States, where I spent the remainder of
the war with a training company at Camp Crowder, Missouri. Along with
the rest of the Ninth Army, I had been racing across Germany so swiftly
during the late winter and spring that when I boarded the plane, I
couldn’t believe its destination lay to the west. My mind might inform
me otherwise, but there was an inertia of the spirit that told me we
were flying to a new front, where we would disembark and continue our
push eastward—eastward until we’d circled the globe, marching through
villages along whose twisting, cobbled streets crowds of the enemy would
watch us take possession of what, up till then, they’d considered their
own. I had changed enough in two years not to mind the trembling of the
old people, the crying of the very young, the uncertainty and fear in
the eyes of the once arrogant. I had been fortunate enough to develop an
infantryman’s heart, which, like his feet, at first aches and swells but
finally grows horny enough for him to travel the weirdest paths without
feeling a thing.</p>
<p>Captain Paul Barrett was my C.O. in Camp Crowder. The day I reported
for duty, he came out of his office to shake my hand. He was short,
gruff, and fiery, and—indoors or out—he wore his polished helmet liner
pulled down to his little eyes. In Europe, he had received a battlefield
commission and a serious chest wound, and he’d been returned to the
States only a few months before. He spoke easily to me, and at the
evening formation he introduced me to the troops. “Gentlemen,” he said,
“Sergeant Thurston, as you know, is no longer with this company. Your
new first sergeant is Sergeant Nathan Marx, here. He is a veteran of the
European theatre, and consequently will expect to find a company of
soldiers here, and not a company of boys.”</p>
<p>I sat up late in the orderly room that evening, trying halfheartedly
to solve the riddle of duty rosters, personnel forms, and morning
reports. The Charge of Quarters slept with his mouth open on a mattress
on the floor. A trainee stood reading the next day’s duty roster, which
was posted on the bulletin board just inside the screen door. It was a
warm evening, and I could hear radios playing dance music over in the
barracks. The trainee, who had been staring at me whenever he thought I
wouldn’t notice, finally took a step in my direction.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sarge—we having a G.I. party tomorrow night?” he asked. A G.I.
party is a barracks cleaning.</p>
<p>“You usually have them on Friday nights?” I asked him.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, and then he added, mysteriously, “That’s the whole
thing.”</p>
<p>“Then you’ll have a G.I. party.”</p>
<p>He turned away, and I heard him mumbling. His shoulders were moving,
and I wondered if he was crying.</p>
<p>“What’s your name, soldier?” I asked.</p>
<p>He turned, not crying at all. Instead, his green-speckled eyes, long
and narrow, flashed like fish in the sun He walked over to me and sat on
the edge of my desk. He reached out a hand. “Sheldon,” he said.</p>
<p>“Stand on your feet, Sheldon.”</p>
<p>Getting off the desk, he said, “Sheldon Grossbart.” He smiled at the
familiarity into which he’d led me.</p>
<p>“You against cleaning the barracks Friday night, Grossbart?” I said.
“Maybe we shouldn’t have G.I. parties. Maybe we should get a maid.” My
tone startled me. I felt I sounded like every top sergeant I had ever
known.</p>
<p>“No, Sergeant.” He grew serious, but with a seriousness that seemed
to be only the stifling of a smile. “It’s just—G.I. parties on Friday
night, of all nights.”</p>
<p>He slipped up onto the corner of the desk again—not quite sitting,
but not quite standing, either. He looked at me with those speckled eyes
flashing, and then made a gesture with his hand. It was very slight—no
more than a movement back and forth of the wrist—and yet it managed to
exclude from our affairs everything else in the orderly room, to make
the two of us the center of the world. It seemed, in fact, to exclude
everything even about the two of us except our hearts.</p>
<p>“Sergeant Thurston was one thing,” he whispered, glancing at the
sleeping C.Q., “but we thought that with you here things might be a
little different.”</p>
<p>“We?”</p>
<p>“The Jewish personnel.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked, harshly. “What’s on your mind?” Whether I was still
angry at the “Sheldon” business, or now at something else, I hadn’t time
to tell, but clearly I was angry.</p>
<p>“We thought you—Marx, you know, like Karl Marx. The Marx Brothers.
Those guys are all—M-a-r-x. Isn’t that how you spell it, Sergeant?”</p>
<p>“M-a-r-x.”</p>
<p>“Fishbein said—” He stopped. “What I mean to say, Sergeant—” His face
and neck were red, and his mouth moved but no words came out. In a
moment, he raised himself to attention, gazing down at me. It was as
though he had suddenly decided he could expect no more sympathy from me
than from Thurston, the reason being that I was of Thurston’s faith, and
not his. The young man had managed to confuse himself as to what my
faith really was, but I felt no desire to straighten him out. Very
simply, I didn’t like him.</p>
<p>When I did nothing but return his gaze, he spoke, in an altered tone.
“You see, Sergeant,” he explained to me, “Friday nights, Jews are
supposed to go to services.”</p>
<p>“Did Sergeant Thurston tell you you couldn’t go to them when there
was a G.I. party?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Did he say you had to stay and scrub the floors?”</p>
<p>“No, Sergeant.”</p>
<p>“Did the Captain say you had to stay and scrub the floors?”</p>
<p>“That isn’t it, Sergeant. It’s the other guys in the barracks.” He
leaned toward me. “They think we’re goofing off. But we’re not. That’s
when Jews go to services, Friday night. We have to.”</p>
<p>“Then go.”</p>
<p>“But the other guys make accusations. They have no right.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the Army’s problem, Grossbart. It’s a personal problem
you’ll have to work out yourself.”</p>
<p>“But it’s unfair.”</p>
<p>I got up to leave. “There’s nothing I can do about it,” I said.</p>
<p>Grossbart stiffened and stood in front of me. “But this is a matter
of religion, sir.”</p>
<p>“Sergeant,” I said.</p>
<p>“I mean ‘Sergeant,’ ” he said, almost snarling.</p>
<p>“Look, go see the chaplain. You want to see Captain Barrett, I’ll
arrange an appointment.”</p>
<p>“No, no, I don’t want to make trouble, Sergeant. That’s the first
thing they throw up to you. I just want my rights!”</p>
<p>“Damn it, Grossbart, stop whining. You have your rights. You can stay
and scrub floors or you can go to shul—”</p>
<p>The smile swam in again. Spittle gleamed at the corners of his mouth.
“You mean church, Sergeant.”</p>
<p>“I mean shul, Grossbart!”</p>
<p>I walked past him and went outside. Near me, I heard the scrunching
of a guard’s boots on gravel. Beyond the lighted windows of the
barracks, young men in T-shirts and fatigue pants were sitting on their
bunks, polishing their rifles. Suddenly there was a light rustling
behind me. I turned and saw Grossbart’s dark frame fleeing back to the
barracks, racing to tell his Jewish friends that they were right—that,
like Karl and Harpo, I was one of them.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The next morning, while chatting with Captain Barrett, I recounted
the incident of the previous evening. Somehow, in the telling, it must
have seemed to the Captain that I was not so much explaining Grossbart’s
position as defending it. “Marx, I’d fight side by side with a nigger if
the fella proved to me he was a man. I pride myself,” he said, looking
out the window, “that I’ve got an open mind. Consequently, Sergeant,
nobody gets special treatment here, for the good or the bad. All a man’s
got to do is prove himself. A man fires well on the range, I give him a
weekend pass. He scores high in P.T., he gets a weekend pass. He earns
it.” He turned from the window and pointed a finger at me. “You’re a
Jewish fella, am I right, Marx?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“And I admire you. I admire you because of the ribbons on your chest.
I judge a man by what he shows me on the field of battle, Sergeant. It’s
what he’s got here,” he said, and then, though I expected he would point
to his heart, he jerked a thumb toward the buttons straining to hold his
blouse across his belly. “Guts,” he said.</p>
<p>“O.K., sir. I only wanted to pass on to you how the men felt.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Marx, you’re going to be old before your time if you worry about
how the men feel. Leave that stuff to the chaplain—that’s his business,
not yours. Let’s us train these fellas to shoot straight. If the Jewish
personnel feels the other men are accusing them of goldbricking—well, I
just don’t know. Seems awful funny that suddenly the Lord is calling so
loud in Private Grossman’s ear he’s just got to run to church.”</p>
<p>“Synagogue,” I said.</p>
<p>“Synagogue is right, Sergeant. I’ll write that down for handy
reference. Thank you for stopping by.”</p>
<p>That evening, a few minutes before the company gathered outside the
orderly room for the chow formation, I called the C.Q., Corporal Robert
LaHill, in to see me. LaHill was a dark, burly fellow whose hair curled
out of his clothes wherever it could. He had a glaze in his eyes that
made one think of caves and dinosaurs. “LaHill,” I said, “when you take
the formation, remind the men that they’re free to attend church
services whenever they are held, provided they report to the orderly
room before they leave the area.”</p>
<p>LaHill scratched his wrist, but gave no indication that he’d heard or
understood.</p>
<p>“LaHill,” I said, “church. You remember? Church, priest, Mass,
confession.”</p>
<p>He curled one lip into a kind of smile; I took it for a signal that
for a second he had flickered back up into the human race.</p>
<p>“Jewish personnel who want to attend services this evening are to
fall out in front of the orderly room at 1900,” I said. Then, as an
afterthought, I added, “By order of Captain Barrett.”</p>
<p>A little while later, as the day’s last light—softer than any I had
seen that year—began to drop over Camp Crowder, I heard LaHill’s thick,
inflectionless voice outside my window: “Give me your ears, troopers.
Toppie says for me to tell you that at 1900 hours all Jewish personnel
is to fall out in front, here, if they want to attend the Jewish
Mass.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>At seven o’clock, I looked out the orderly-room window and saw three
soldiers in starched khakis standing on the dusty quadrangle. They
looked at their watches and fidgeted while they whispered back and
forth. It was getting dimmer, and, alone on the otherwise deserted
field, they looked tiny. When I opened the door, I heard the noises of
the G.I. party coming from the surrounding barracks—bunks being pushed
to the walls, faucets pounding water into buckets, brooms whisking at
the wooden floors, cleaning the dirt away for Saturday’s inspection. Big
puffs of cloth moved round and round on the windowpanes. I walked
outside, and the moment my foot hit the ground I thought I heard
Grossbart call to the others, “ ’Ten-hut!” Or maybe, when they all three
jumped to attention, I imagined I heard the command.</p>
<p>Grossbart stepped forward. “Thank you, sir,” he said.</p>
<p>“ ‘Sergeant,’ Grossbart,” I reminded him. “You call officers ‘sir.’
I’m not an officer. You’ve been in the Army three weeks—you know
that.”</p>
<p>He turned his palms out at his sides to indicate that, in truth, he
and I lived beyond convention. “Thank you, anyway,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” a tall boy behind him said. “Thanks a lot.”</p>
<p>And the third boy whispered, “Thank you,” but his mouth barely
fluttered, so that he did not alter by more than a lip’s movement his
posture of attention.</p>
<p>“For what?” I asked. Grossbart snorted happily. “For the
announcement. The Corporal’s announcement. It helped. It made it—”</p>
<p>“Fancier.” The tall boy finished Grossbart’s sentence.</p>
<p>Grossbart smiled. “He means formal, sir. Public,” he said to me. “Now
it won’t seem as though we’re just taking off—goldbricking because the
work has begun.”</p>
<p>“It was by order of Captain Barrett,” I said.</p>
<p>“Aaah, but you pull a little weight,” Grossbart said. “So we thank
you.” Then he turned to his companions. “Sergeant Marx, I want you to
meet Larry Fishbein.” The tall boy stepped forward and extended his
hand. I shook it. “You from New York?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Me, too.” He had a cadaverous face that collapsed inward from his
cheekbone to his jaw, and when he smiled—as he did at the news of our
communal attachment—revealed a mouthful of bad teeth. He was blinking
his eyes a good deal, as though he were fighting back tears. “What
borough?” he asked.</p>
<p>I turned to Grossbart. “It’s five after seven. What time are
services?”</p>
<p>“Shul,” he said, smiling, “is in ten minutes. I want you to meet
Mickey Halpern. This is Nathan Marx, our sergeant.”</p>
<p>The third boy hopped forward. “Private Michael Halpern.” He
saluted.</p>
<p>“Salute officers, Halpern,” I said. The boy dropped his hand, and, on
its way down, in his nervousness, checked to see if his shirt pockets
were buttoned.</p>
<p>“Shall I march them over, sir?” Grossbart asked. “Or are you coming
along?”</p>
<p>From behind Grossbart, Fishbein piped up. “Afterward, they’re having
refreshments. A ladies’ auxiliary from St. Louis, the rabbi told us last
week.”</p>
<p>“The chaplain,” Halpern whispered.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome to come along,” Grossbart said.</p>
<p>To avoid his plea, I looked away, and saw, in the windows of the
barracks, a cloud of faces staring out at the four of us. “Hurry along,
Grossbart,” I said.</p>
<p>“O.K., then,” he said. He turned to the others. “Double time,
march!”</p>
<p>They started off, but ten feet away Grossbart spun around and,
running backward, called to me, “Good shabbus, sir!” And then the three
of them were swallowed into the alien Missouri dusk.</p>
<p>Even after they had disappeared over the parade ground, whose green
was now a deep blue, I could hear Grossbart singing the double-time
cadence, and as it grew dimmer and dimmer, it suddenly touched a deep
memory—as did the slant of the light—and I was remembering the shrill
sounds of a Bronx playground where, years ago, beside the Grand
Concourse, I had played on long spring evenings such as this. It was a
pleasant memory for a young man so far from peace and home, and it
brought so many recollections with it that I began to grow exceedingly
tender about myself. In fact, I indulged myself in a reverie so strong
that I felt as though a hand were reaching down inside me. It had to
reach so very far to touch me! It had to reach past those days in the
forests of Belgium, and past the dying I’d refused to weep over; past
the nights in German farmhouses whose books we’d burned to warm us; past
endless stretches when I had shut off all softness I might feel for my
fellows, and had managed even to deny myself the posture of a
conqueror—the swagger that I, as a Jew, might well have worn as my boots
whacked against the rubble of Wesel, Münster, and Braunschweig.</p>
<p>But now one night noise, one rumor of home and time past, and memory
plunged down through all I had anesthetized, and came to what I suddenly
remembered was myself. So it was not altogether curious that, in search
of more of me, I found myself following Grossbart’s tracks to Chapel
No. 3, where the Jewish services were being held.</p>
<p>I took a seat in the last row, which was empty. Two rows in front of
me sat Grossbart, Fishbein, and Halpern, holding little white Dixie
cups. Each row of seats was raised higher than the one in front of it,
and I could see clearly what was going on. Fishbein was pouring the
contents of his cup into Grossbart’s, and Grossbart looked mirthful as
the liquid made a purple arc between Fishbein’s hand and his. In the
glaring yellow light, I saw the chaplain standing on the platform at the
front; he was chanting the first line of the responsive reading.
Grossbart’s prayer book remained closed on his lap; he was swishing the
cup around. Only Halpern responded to the chant by praying. The fingers
of his right hand were spread wide across the cover of his open book.
His cap was pulled down low onto his brow, which made it round, like a
yarmulke. From time to time, Grossbart wet his lips at the cup’s edge;
Fishbein, his long yellow face a dying light bulb, looked from here to
there, craning forward to catch sight of the faces down the row, then of
those in front of him, then behind. He saw me, and his eyelids beat a
tattoo. His elbow slid into Grossbart’s side, his neck inclined toward
his friend, he whispered something, and then, when the congregation next
responded to the chant, Grossbart’s voice was among the others. Fishbein
looked into his book now, too; his lips, however, didn’t move.</p>
<p>Finally, it was time to drink the wine. The chaplain smiled down at
them as Grossbart swigged his in one long gulp, Halpern sipped,
meditating, and Fishbein faked devotion with an empty cup. “As I look
down amongst the congregation”—the chaplain grinned at the word—“this
night, I see many new faces, and I want to welcome you to Friday-night
services here at Camp Crowder. I am Major Leo Ben Ezra, your chaplain.”
Though an American, the chaplain spoke deliberately—syllable by
syllable, almost—as though to communicate, above all, with the lip
readers in his audience. “I have only a few words to say before we
adjourn to the refreshment room, where the kind ladies of the Temple
Sinai, St. Louis, Missouri, have a nice setting for you.”</p>
<p>Applause and whistling broke out. After another momentary grin, the
chaplain raised his hands, palms out, his eyes flicking upward a moment,
as if to remind the troops where they were and Who Else might be in
attendance. In the sudden silence that followed, I thought I heard
Grossbart cackle, “Let the goyim clean the floors!” Were those the
words? I wasn’t sure, but Fishbein, grinning, nudged Halpern. Halpern
looked dumbly at him, then went back to his prayer book, which had been
occupying him all through the rabbi’s talk. One hand tugged at the black
kinky hair that stuck out under his cap. His lips moved.</p>
<p>The rabbi continued. “It is about the food that I want to speak to
you for a moment. I know, I know, I know,” he intoned, wearily, “how in
the mouths of most of you the trafe food tastes like ashes. I know how
you gag, some of you, and how your parents suffer to think of their
children eating foods unclean and offensive to the palate. What can I
tell you? I can only say, close your eyes and swallow as best you can.
Eat what you must to live, and throw away the rest. I wish I could help
more. For those of you who find this impossible, may I ask that you try
and try, but then come to see me in private. If your revulsion is so
great, we will have to seek aid from those higher up.”</p>
<p>A round of chatter rose and subsided. Then everyone sang “Ain
Kelohainu;” after all those years, I discovered, I still knew the words.
Then, suddenly, the service over, Grossbart was upon me. “Higher up? He
means the General?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Shelly,” Fishbein said, “he means God.” He smacked his face and
looked at Halpern. “How high can you go!”</p>
<p>“Sh-h-h!” Grossbart said. “What do you think, Sergeant?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “You better ask the chaplain.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to. I’m making an appointment to see him in private. So is
Mickey.”</p>
<p>Halpern shook his head. “No, no, Sheldon—”</p>
<p>“You have rights, Mickey,” Grossbart said. “They can’t push us
around.”</p>
<p>“It’s O.K.,” said Halpern. “It bothers my mother, not me.”</p>
<p>Grossbart looked at me. “Yesterday he threw up. From the hash. It was
all ham and God knows what else.”</p>
<p>“I have a cold—that was why,” Halpern said. He pushed his yarmulke
back into a cap.</p>
<p>“What about you, Fishbein?” I asked. “You kosher, too?”</p>
<p>He flushed. “A little. But I’ll let it ride. I have a very strong
stomach, and I don’t eat a lot anyway.” I continued to look at him, and
he held up his wrist to reinforce what he’d just said; his watch strap
was tightened to the last hole, and he pointed that out to me.</p>
<p>“But services are important to you?” I asked him.</p>
<p>He looked at Grossbart. “Sure, sir.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Sergeant.’ ”</p>
<p>“Not so much at home,” said Grossbart, stepping between us, “but away
from home it gives one a sense of his Jewishness.”</p>
<p>“We have to stick together,” Fishbein said.</p>
<p>I started to walk toward the door; Halpern stepped back to make way
for me.</p>
<p>“That’s what happened in Germany,” Grossbart was saying, loud enough
for me to hear. “They didn’t stick together. They let themselves get
pushed around.”</p>
<p>I turned. “Look, Grossbart. This is the Army, not summer camp.”</p>
<p>He smiled. “So?”</p>
<p>Halpern tried to sneak off, but Grossbart held his arm.</p>
<p>“Grossbart, how old are you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Nineteen.”</p>
<p>“And you?” I said to Fishbein.</p>
<p>“The same. The same month, even.”</p>
<p>“And what about him?” I pointed to Halpern, who had by now made it
safely to the door.</p>
<p>“Eighteen,” Grossbart whispered. “But like he can’t tie his shoes or
brush his teeth himself. I feel sorry for him.”</p>
<p>“I feel sorry for all of us, Grossbart,” I said, “but just act like a
man. Just don’t overdo it.”</p>
<p>“Overdo what, sir?”</p>
<p>“The ‘sir’ business, for one thing. Don’t overdo that,” I said.</p>
<p>I left him standing there. I passed by Halpern, but he did not look
at me. Then I was outside, but, behind, I heard Grossbart call, “Hey,
Mickey, my leben, come on back. Refreshments!”</p>
<p>“Leben!” My grandmother’s word for me!</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>One morning a week later, while I was working at my desk, Captain
Barrett shouted for me to come into his office. When I entered, he had
his helmet liner squashed down so far on his head that I couldn’t even
see his eyes. He was on the phone, and when he spoke to me, he cupped
one hand over the mouthpiece. “Who the hell is Grossbart?”</p>
<p>“Third platoon, Captain,” I said. “A trainee.”</p>
<p>“What’s all this stink about food? His mother called a goddam
congressman about the food.” He uncovered the mouthpiece and slid his
helmet up until I could see his bottom eyelashes. “Yes, sir,” he said
into the phone. “Yes, sir. I’m still here, sir. I’m asking Marx, here,
right now—”</p>
<p>He covered the mouthpiece again and turned his head back toward me.
“Lightfoot Harry’s on the phone,” he said, between his teeth. “This
congressman calls General Lyman, who calls Colonel Sousa, who calls the
Major, who calls me. They’re just dying to stick this thing on me.
Whatsa matter?” He shook the phone at me. “I don’t feed the troops? What
the hell is this?”</p>
<p>“Sir, Grossbart is strange—” Barrett greeted that with a mockingly
indulgent smile. I altered my approach. “Captain, he’s a very orthodox
Jew, and so he’s only allowed to eat certain foods.”</p>
<p>“He throws up, the congressman said. Every time he eats something,
his mother says, he throws up!”</p>
<p>“He’s accustomed to observing the dietary laws, Captain.”</p>
<p>“So why’s his old lady have to call the White House?”</p>
<p>“Jewish parents, sir—they’re apt to be more protective than you
expect. I mean, Jews have a very close family life. A boy goes away from
home, sometimes the mother is liable to get very upset. Probably the boy
mentioned something in a letter, and his mother misinterpreted.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to punch him one right in the mouth,” the Captain said.
“There’s a goddam war on, and he wants a silver platter!”</p>
<p>“I don’t think the boy’s to blame, sir. I’m sure we can straighten it
out by just asking him. Jewish parents worry—”</p>
<p>“All parents worry, for Christ’s sake. But they don’t get on their
high horse and start pulling strings—”</p>
<p>I interrupted, my voice higher, tighter than before. “The home life,
Captain, is very important—but you’re right, it may sometimes get out of
hand. It’s a very wonderful thing, Captain, but because it’s so close,
this kind of thing…”</p>
<p>He didn’t listen any longer to my attempt to present both myself and
Lightfoot Harry with an explanation for the letter. He turned back to
the phone. “Sir?” he said. “Sir—Marx, here, tells me Jews have a
tendency to be pushy. He says he thinks we can settle it right here in
the company…. Yes, sir…. I will call back, sir, soon as I can.” He hung
up. “Where are the men, Sergeant?”</p>
<p>“On the range.”</p>
<p>With a whack on the top of his helmet, he crushed it down over his
eyes again, and charged out of his chair. “We’re going for a ride,” he
said.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The Captain drove, and I sat beside him. It was a hot spring day, and
under my newly starched fatigues I felt as though my armpits were
melting down onto my sides and chest. The roads were dry, and by the
time we reached the firing range, my teeth felt gritty with dust, though
my mouth had been shut the whole trip. The Captain slammed the brakes on
and told me to get the hell out and find Grossbart.</p>
<p>I found him on his belly, firing wildly at the five-hundred-feet
target. Waiting their turns behind him were Halpern and Fishbein.
Fishbein, wearing a pair of rimless G.I. glasses I hadn’t seen on him
before, had the appearance of an old peddler who would gladly have sold
you his rifle and the cartridges that were slung all over him. I stood
back by the ammo boxes, waiting for Grossbart to finish spraying the
distant targets. Fishbein straggled back to stand near me.</p>
<p>“Hello, Sergeant Marx,” he said.</p>
<p>“How are you?” I mumbled.</p>
<p>“Fine, thank you. Sheldon’s really a good shot.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t notice.”</p>
<p>“I’m not so good, but I think I’m getting the hang of it now.
Sergeant, I don’t mean to, you know, ask what I shouldn’t—” The boy
stopped. He was trying to speak intimately, but the noise of the
shooting forced him to shout at me.</p>
<p>“What is it?” I asked. Down the range, I saw Captain Barrett standing
up in the jeep, scanning the line for me and Grossbart.</p>
<p>“My parents keep asking and asking where we’re going,” Fishbein said.
“Everybody says the Pacific. I don’t care, but my parents— If I could
relieve their minds, I think I could concentrate more on my
shooting.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know where, Fishbein. Try to concentrate anyway.”</p>
<p>“Sheldon says you might be able to find out.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know a thing, Fishbein. You just take it easy, and don’t let
Sheldon—”</p>
<p>“I’m taking it easy, Sergeant. It’s at home—”</p>
<p>Grossbart had finished on the line, and was dusting his fatigues with
one hand. I called to him. “Grossbart, the Captain wants to see
you.”</p>
<p>He came toward us. His eyes blazed and twinkled. “Hi!”</p>
<p>“Don’t point that goddam rifle!” I said.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t shoot you, Sarge.” He gave me a smile as wide as a
pumpkin, and turned the barrel aside.</p>
<p>“Damn you, Grossbart, this is no joke! Follow me.”</p>
<p>I walked ahead of him, and had the awful suspicion that, behind me,
Grossbart was marching, his rifle on his shoulder, as though he were a
one-man detachment. At the jeep, he gave the Captain a rifle salute.
“Private Sheldon Grossbart, sir.”</p>
<p>“At ease, Grossman.” The Captain sat down, slid over into the empty
seat, and, crooking a finger, invited Grossbart closer.</p>
<p>“Bart, sir. Sheldon Grossbart. It’s a common error.” Grossbart nodded
at me; I understood, he indicated. I looked away just as the mess truck
pulled up to the range, disgorging a half-dozen K.P.s with rolled-up
sleeves. The mess sergeant screamed at them while they set up the
chow-line equipment.</p>
<p>“Grossbart, your mama wrote some congressman that we don’t feed you
right. Do you know that?” the Captain said.</p>
<p>“It was my father, sir. He wrote to Representative Franconi that my
religion forbids me to eat certain foods.”</p>
<p>“What religion is that, Grossbart?”</p>
<p>“Jewish.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Jewish, sir,’ ” I said to Grossbart.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, sir. Jewish, sir.”</p>
<p>“What have you been living on?” the Captain asked. “You’ve been in
the Army a month already. You don’t look to me like you’re falling to
pieces.”</p>
<p>“I eat because I have to, sir. But Sergeant Marx will testify to the
fact that I don’t eat one mouthful more than I need to in order to
survive.”</p>
<p>“Is that so, Marx?” Barrett asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen Grossbart eat, sir,” I said.</p>
<p>“But you heard the rabbi,” Grossbart said. “He told us what to do,
and I listened.”</p>
<p>The Captain looked at me. “Well, Marx?”</p>
<p>“I still don’t know what he eats and doesn’t eat, sir.”</p>
<p>Grossbart raised his arms to plead with me, and it looked for a
moment as though he were going to hand me his weapon to hold. “But,
Sergeant—”</p>
<p>“Look, Grossbart, just answer the Captain’s questions,” I said
sharply.</p>
<p>Barrett smiled at me, and I resented it. “All right, Grossbart,” he
said. “What is it you want? The little piece of paper? You want
out?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. Only to be allowed to live as a Jew. And for the others,
too.”</p>
<p>“What others?”</p>
<p>“Fishbein, sir, and Halpern.”</p>
<p>“They don’t like the way we serve, either?”</p>
<p>“Halpern throws up, sir. I’ve seen it.”</p>
<p>“I thought you throw up.”</p>
<p>“Just once, sir. I didn’t know the sausage was sausage.”</p>
<p>“We’ll give menus, Grossbart. We’ll show training films about the
food, so you can identify when we’re trying to poison you.”</p>
<p>Grossbart did not answer. The men had been organized into two long
chow lines. At the tail end of one, I spotted Fishbein—or, rather, his
glasses spotted me. They winked sunlight back at me. Halpern stood next
to him, patting the inside of his collar with a khaki handkerchief. They
moved with the line as it began to edge up toward the food. The mess
sergeant was still screaming at the K.P.s. For a moment, I was actually
terrified by the thought that somehow the mess sergeant was going to
become involved in Grossbart’s problem.</p>
<p>“Marx,” the Captain said, “you’re a Jewish fella—am I right?”</p>
<p>I played straight man. “Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“How long you been in the Army? Tell this boy.”</p>
<p>“Three years and two months.”</p>
<p>“A year in combat, Grossbart. Twelve goddam months in combat all
through Europe. I admire this man.” The Captain snapped a wrist against
my chest. “Do you hear him peeping about the food? Do you? I want an
answer, Grossbart. Yes or no.”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“And why not? He’s a Jewish fella.”</p>
<p>“Some things are more important to some Jews than other things to
other Jews.”</p>
<p>Barrett blew up. “Look, Grossbart. Marx, here, is a good man—a goddam
hero. When you were in high school, Sergeant Marx was killing Germans.
Who does more for the Jews—you, by throwing up over a lousy piece of
sausage, a piece of first-cut meat, or Marx, by killing those Nazi
bastards? If I was a Jew, Grossbart, I’d kiss this man’s feet. He’s a
goddam hero, and he eats what we give him. Why do you have to cause
trouble is what I want to know! What is it you’re buckin’ for—a
discharge?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“I’m talking to a wall! Sergeant, get him out of my way.” Barrett
swung himself back into the driver’s seat. “I’m going to see the
chaplain.” The engine roared, the jeep spun around in a whirl of dust,
and the Captain was headed back to camp.</p>
<p>For a moment, Grossbart and I stood side by side, watching the jeep.
Then he looked at me and said, “I don’t want to start trouble. That’s
the first thing they toss up to us.”</p>
<p>When he spoke, I saw that his teeth were white and straight, and the
sight of them suddenly made me understand that Grossbart actually did
have parents—that once upon a time someone had taken little Sheldon to
the dentist. He was their son. Despite all the talk about his parents,
it was hard to believe in Grossbart as a child, an heir—as related by
blood to anyone, mother, father, or, above all, to me. This realization
led me to another.</p>
<p>“What does your father do, Grossbart?” I asked as we started to walk
back toward the chow line.</p>
<p>“He’s a tailor”</p>
<p>“An American?”</p>
<p>“Now, yes. A son in the Army,” he said, jokingly.</p>
<p>“And your mother?” I asked.</p>
<p>He winked. “A ballabusta. She practically sleeps with a dustcloth in
her hand.”</p>
<p>“She’s also an immigrant?”</p>
<p>“All she talks is Yiddish, still.”</p>
<p>“And your father, too?”</p>
<p>“A little English. ‘Clean,’ ‘Press,’ ‘Take the pants in.’ That’s the
extent of it. But they’re good to me.”</p>
<p>“Then, Grossbart—” I reached out and stopped him. He turned toward
me, and when our eyes met, his seemed to jump back, to shiver in their
sockets. “Grossbart—you were the one who wrote that letter, weren’t
you?”</p>
<p>It took only a second or two for his eyes to flash happy again.
“Yes.” He walked on, and I kept pace. “It’s what my father would have
written if he had known how. It was his name, though. He signed it. He
even mailed it. I sent it home. For the New York postmark.”</p>
<p>I was astonished, and he saw it. With complete seriousness, he thrust
his right arm in front of me. “Blood is blood, Sergeant,” he said,
pinching the blue vein in his wrist.</p>
<p>“What the hell are you trying to do, Grossbart?” I asked. “I’ve seen
you eat. Do you know that? I told the Captain I don’t know what you eat,
but I’ve seen you eat like a hound at chow.”</p>
<p>“We work hard, Sergeant. We’re in training. For a furnace to work,
you’ve got to feed it coal.”</p>
<p>“Why did you say in the letter that you threw up all the time?”</p>
<p>“I was really talking about Mickey there. I was talking for him. He
would never write, Sergeant, though I pleaded with him. He’ll waste away
to nothing if I don’t help. Sergeant, I used my name—my father’s
name—but it’s Mickey, and Fishbein, too, I’m watching out for.”</p>
<p>“You’re a regular Messiah, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>We were at the chow line now.</p>
<p>“That’s a good one, Sergeant,” he said, smiling. “But who knows? Who
can tell? Maybe you’re the Messiah a little bit. What Mickey says is the
Messiah is a collective idea. He went to Yeshiva, Mickey, for a while.
He says together we’re the Messiah. Me a little bit, you a little bit.
You should hear that kid talk, Sergeant, when he gets going.”</p>
<p>“Me a little bit, you a little bit,” I said. “You’d like to believe
that, wouldn’t you, Grossbart? That would make everything so clean for
you.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem too bad a thing to believe, Sergeant. It only means
we should all give a little, is all.”</p>
<p>I walked off to eat my rations with the other noncoms.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Two days later, a letter addressed to Captain Barrett passed over my
desk. It had come through the chain of command—from the office of
Congressman Franconi, where it had been received, to General Lyman, to
Colonel Sousa, to Major Lamont, now to Captain Barrett. I read it over
twice. It was dated May 14th, the day Barrett had spoken with Grossbart
on the rifle range.</p>
<pre><code>            Dear Congressman:</code></pre>
<p>First let me thank you for your interest in behalf of my son, Private
Sheldon Grossbart. Fortunately, I was able to speak with Sheldon on the
phone the other night, and I think I’ve been able to solve our problem.
He is, as I mentioned in my last letter, a very religious boy, and it
was only with the greatest difficulty that I could persuade him that the
religious thing to do—what God Himself would want Sheldon to do—would be
to suffer the pangs of religious remorse for the good of his country and
all mankind. It took some doing, Congressman, but finally he saw the
light. In fact, what he said (and I wrote down the words on a scratch
pad so as never to forget), what he said was “I guess you’re right, Dad.
So many millions of my fellow-Jews gave up their lives to the enemy, the
least I can do is live for a while minus a bit of my heritage so as to
help end this struggle and regain for all the children of God dignity
and humanity.” That, Congressman, would make any father proud.</p>
<p>By the way, Sheldon wanted me to know—and to pass on to you—the name
of a soldier who helped him reach this decision: Sergeant Nathan Marx.
Sergeant Marx is a combat veteran who is Sheldon’s first sergeant. This
man has helped Sheldon over some of the first hurdles he’s had to face
in the Army, and is in part responsible for Sheldon’s changing his mind
about the dietary laws. I know Sheldon would appreciate any recognition
Marx could receive.</p>
<p>Thank you and good luck. I look forward to seeing your name on the
next election ballot.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Samuel E. Grossbart</p>
<p>Attached to the Grossbart communiqué was another, addressed to
General Marshall Lyman, the post commander, and signed by Representative
Charles E. Franconi, of the House of Representatives. The communiqué
informed General Lyman that Sergeant Nathan Marx was a credit to the
U.S. Army and the Jewish people.</p>
<p>What was Grossbart’s motive in recanting? Did he feel he’d gone too
far? Was the letter a strategic retreat—a crafty attempt to strengthen
what he considered our alliance? Or had he actually changed his mind,
via an imaginary dialogue between Grossbart père and Grossbart fils? I
was puzzled, but only for a few days—that is, only until I realized
that, whatever his reasons, he had actually decided to disappear from my
life; he was going to allow himself to become just another trainee. I
saw him at inspection, but he never winked; at chow formations, but he
never flashed me a sign. On Sundays, with the other trainees, he would
sit around watching the noncoms’ softball team, for which I pitched, but
not once did he speak an unnecessary word to me. Fishbein and Halpern
retreated, too—at Grossbart’s command, I was sure. Apparently he had
seen that wisdom lay in turning back before he plunged over into the
ugliness of privilege undeserved. Our separation allowed me to forgive
him our past encounters, and, finally, to admire him for his good
sense.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Meanwhile, free of Grossbart, I grew used to my job and my
administrative tasks. I stepped on a scale one day, and discovered I had
truly become a noncombatant; I had gained seven pounds. I found patience
to get past the first three pages of a book. I thought about the future
more and more, and wrote letters to girls I’d known before the war. I
even got a few answers. I sent away to Columbia for a Law School
catalogue. I continued to follow the war in the Pacific, but it was not
my war. I thought I could see the end, and sometimes, at night, I
dreamed that I was walking on the streets of Manhattan—Broadway, Third
Avenue, 116th Street, where I had lived the three years I attended
Columbia. I curled myself around these dreams and I began to be
happy.</p>
<p>And then, one Saturday, when everybody was away and I was alone in
the orderly room reading a month-old copy of the Sporting News,
Grossbart reappeared.</p>
<p>“You a baseball fan, Sergeant?”</p>
<p>I looked up. “How are you?”</p>
<p>“Fine,” Grossbart said. “They’re making a soldier out of me.”</p>
<p>“How are Fishbein and Halpern?”</p>
<p>“Coming along,” he said. “We’ve got no training this afternoon.
They’re at the movies.”</p>
<p>“How come you’re not with them?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to come over and say hello.”</p>
<p>He smiled—a shy, regular-guy smile, as though he and I well knew that
our friendship drew its sustenance from unexpected visits, remembered
birthdays, and borrowed lawnmowers. At first it offended me, and then
the feeling was swallowed by the general uneasiness I felt at the
thought that everyone on the post was locked away in a dark movie
theatre and I was here alone with Grossbart. I folded up my paper.</p>
<p>“Sergeant,” he said, “I’d like to ask a favor. It is a favor, and I’m
making no bones about it.”</p>
<p>He stopped, allowing me to refuse him a hearing—which, of course,
forced me into a courtesy I did not intend. “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Well, actually it’s two favors.”</p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p>“The first one’s about these rumors. Everybody says we’re going to
the Pacific.”</p>
<p>“As I told your friend Fishbein, I don’t know,” I said. “You’ll just
have to wait to find out. Like everybody else.”</p>
<p>“You think there’s a chance of any of us going East?”</p>
<p>“Germany?” I said. “Maybe.”</p>
<p>“I meant New York.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so, Grossbart. Offhand.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for the information, Sergeant,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s not information, Grossbart. Just what I surmise.”</p>
<p>“It certainly would be good to be near home. My parents—you know.” He
took a step toward the door and then turned back. “Oh, the other thing.
May I ask the other?”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“The other thing is—I’ve got relatives in St. Louis, and they say
they’ll give me a whole Passover dinner if I can get down there. God,
Sergeant, that’d mean an awful lot to me.”</p>
<p>I stood up. “No passes during basic, Grossbart.”</p>
<p>“But we’re off from now till Monday morning, Sergeant. I could leave
the post and no one would even know.”</p>
<p>“I’d know. You’d know.”</p>
<p>“But that’s all. Just the two of us. Last night, I called my aunt,
and you should have heard her. ‘Come—come,’ she said. ‘I got gefilte
fish, chrain—the works!’ Just a day, Sergeant. I’d take the blame if
anything happened.”</p>
<p>“The Captain isn’t here to sign a pass.”</p>
<p>“You could sign.”</p>
<p>“Look, Grossbart—”</p>
<p>“Sergeant, for two months, practically, I’ve been eating trafe till I
want to die.”</p>
<p>“I thought you’d made up your mind to live with it. To be minus a
little bit of heritage.”</p>
<p>He pointed a finger at me. “You!” he said. “That wasn’t for you to
read.”</p>
<p>“I read it. So what?”</p>
<p>“That letter was addressed to a congressman.”</p>
<p>“Grossbart, don’t feed me any baloney. You wanted me to read it.”</p>
<p>“Why are you persecuting me, Sergeant?”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding!”</p>
<p>“I’ve run into this before,” he said, “but never from my own!”</p>
<p>“Get out of here, Grossbart! Get the hell out of my sight!”</p>
<p>He did not move. “Ashamed, that’s what you are,” he said. “So you
take it out on the rest of us. They say Hitler himself was half a Jew.
Hearing you, I wouldn’t doubt it.”</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do with me, Grossbart?” I asked him. “What
are you after? You want me to give you special privileges, to change the
food, to find out about your orders, to give you weekend passes.”</p>
<p>“You even talk like a goy!” Grossbart shook his fist. “Is this just a
weekend pass I’m asking for? Is a Seder sacred, or not?”</p>
<p>Seder! It suddenly occurred to me that Passover had been celebrated
weeks before. I said so.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” he replied. “Who says no? A month ago—and I was in
the field eating hash! And now all I ask is a simple favor. A Jewish boy
I thought would understand. My aunt’s willing to go out of her way—to
make a Seder a month later….” He turned to go, mumbling.</p>
<p>“Come back here!” I called. He stopped and looked at me. “Grossbart,
why can’t you be like the rest? Why do you have to stick out like a sore
thumb?”</p>
<p>“Because I’m a Jew, Sergeant. I am different. Better, maybe not. But
different.”</p>
<p>“This is a war, Grossbart. For the time being be the same.”</p>
<p>“I refuse.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I refuse. I can’t stop being me, that’s all there is to it.” Tears
came to his eyes. “It’s a hard thing to be a Jew. But now I understand
what Mickey says—it’s a harder thing to stay one.” He raised a hand
sadly toward me. “Look at you.”</p>
<p>“Stop crying!”</p>
<p>“Stop this, stop that, stop the other thing! You stop, Sergeant. Stop
closing your heart to your own!” And, wiping his face with his sleeve,
he ran out the door. “The least we can do for one another—the
least…”</p>
<p>An hour later, looking out of the window, I saw Grossbart headed
across the field. He wore a pair of starched khakis and carried a little
leather ditty bag. I went out into the heat of the day. It was quiet;
not a soul was in sight except, over by the mess hall, four K.P.s
sitting around a pan, sloped forward from their waists, gabbing and
peeling potatoes in the sun.</p>
<p>“Grossbart!” I called.</p>
<p>He looked toward me and continued walking.</p>
<p>“Grossbart, get over here!”</p>
<p>He turned and came across the field. Finally, he stood before me.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” I asked.</p>
<p>“St. Louis. I don’t care.”</p>
<p>“You’ll get caught without a pass.”</p>
<p>“So I’ll get caught without a pass.”</p>
<p>“You’ll go to the stockade.”</p>
<p>“I’m in the stockade.” He made an about-face and headed off.</p>
<p>I let him go only a step or two. “Come back here,” I said, and he
followed me into the office, where I typed out a pass and signed the
Captain’s name, and my own initials after it.</p>
<p>He took the pass and then, a moment later, reached out and grabbed my
hand. “Sergeant, you don’t know how much this means to me.”</p>
<p>“O.K.,” I said. “Don’t get in any trouble.”</p>
<p>“I wish I could show you how much this means to me.”</p>
<p>“Don’t do me any favors. Don’t write any more congressmen for
citations.”</p>
<p>He smiled. “You’re right. I won’t. But let me do something.”</p>
<p>“Bring me a piece of that gefilte fish. Just get out of here.”</p>
<p>“I will!” he said. “With a slice of carrot and a little horseradish.
I won’t forget.”</p>
<p>“All right. Just show your pass at the gate. And don’t tell
anybody.”</p>
<p>“I won’t. It’s a month late, but a good Yom Tov to you.”</p>
<p>“Good Yom Tov, Grossbart,” I said.</p>
<p>“You’re a good Jew, Sergeant. You like to think you have a hard
heart, but underneath you’re a fine, decent man. I mean that.”</p>
<p>Those last three words touched me more than any words from
Grossbart’s mouth had the right to. “All right, Grossbart,” I said. “Now
call me ‘sir,’ and get the hell out of here.”</p>
<p>He ran out the door and was gone. I felt very pleased with myself; it
was a great relief to stop fighting Grossbart, and it had cost me
nothing. Barrett would never find out, and if he did, I could manage to
invent some excuse. For a while, I sat at my desk, comfortable in my
decision. Then the screen door flew back and Grossbart burst in again.
“Sergeant!” he said. Behind him I saw Fishbein and Halpern, both in
starched khakis, both carrying ditty bags like Grossbart’s.</p>
<p>“Sergeant, I caught Mickey and Larry coming out of the movies. I
almost missed them.”</p>
<p>“Grossbart—did I say tell no one?” I said.</p>
<p>“But my aunt said I could bring friends. That I should, in fact.”</p>
<p>“I’m the Sergeant, Grossbart—not your aunt!”</p>
<p>Grossbart looked at me in disbelief. He pulled Halpern up by his
sleeve. “Mickey, tell the Sergeant what this would mean to you.”</p>
<p>Halpern looked at me and, shrugging, said, “A lot.”</p>
<p>Fishbein stepped forward without prompting. “This would mean a great
deal to me and my parents, Sergeant Marx.”</p>
<p>“No!” I shouted.</p>
<p>Grossbart was shaking his head. “Sergeant, I could see you denying
me, but how you can deny Mickey, a Yeshiva boy—that’s beyond me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not denying Mickey anything,” I said. “You just pushed a little
too hard, Grossbart. You denied him.”</p>
<p>“I’ll give him my pass, then,” Grossbart said. “I’ll give him my
aunt’s address and a little note. At least let him go.”</p>
<p>In a second, he had crammed the pass into Halpern’s pants pocket.
Halpern looked at me, and so did Fishbein. Grossbart was at the door,
pushing it open. “Mickey, bring me a piece of gefilte fish, at least,”
he said, and then he was outside again.</p>
<p>The three of us looked at one another, and then I said, “Halpern,
hand that pass over.”</p>
<p>He took it from his pocket and gave it to me. Fishbein had now moved
to the doorway, where he lingered. He stood there for a moment with his
mouth slightly open, and then he pointed to himself. “And me?” he
asked.</p>
<p>His utter ridiculousness exhausted me. I slumped down in my seat and
felt pulses knocking at the back of my eyes. “Fishbein,” I said, “you
understand I’m not trying to deny you anything, don’t you? If it was my
Army, I’d serve gefilte fish in the mess hall. I’d sell kugel in the PX,
honest to God.”</p>
<p>Halpern smiled.</p>
<p>“You understand, don’t you, Halpern?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sergeant.”</p>
<p>“And you, Fishbein? I don’t want enemies. I’m just like you—I want to
serve my time and go home. I miss the same things you miss.”</p>
<p>“Then, Sergeant,” Fishbein said, “why don’t you come, too?”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“To St. Louis. To Shelly’s aunt. We’ll have a regular Seder. Play
hide-the-matzo.” He gave me a broad, black-toothed smile.</p>
<p>I saw Grossbart again, on the other side of the screen.</p>
<p>“Pst!” He waved a piece of paper. “Mickey, here’s the address. Tell
her I couldn’t get away.”</p>
<p>Halpern did not move. He looked at me, and I saw the shrug moving up
his arms into his shoulders again. I took the cover off my typewriter
and made out passes for him and Fishbein. “Go,” I said. “The three of
you.”</p>
<p>I thought Halpern was going to kiss my hand.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>That afternoon, in a bar in Joplin, I drank beer and listened with
half an ear to the Cardinal game. I tried to look squarely at what I’d
become involved in, and began to wonder if perhaps the struggle with
Grossbart wasn’t as much my fault as his. What was I that I had to
muster generous feelings? Who was I to have been feeling so grudging, so
tight-hearted? After all, I wasn’t being asked to move the world. Had I
a right, then, or a reason, to clamp down on Grossbart, when that meant
clamping down on Halpern, too? And Fishbein—that ugly, agreeable soul?
Out of the many recollections of my childhood that had tumbled over me
these past few days, I heard my grandmother’s voice: “What are you
making a tsimmes?” It was what she would ask my mother when, say, I had
cut myself while doing something I shouldn’t have done, and her daughter
was busy bawling me out. I needed a hug and a kiss, and my mother would
moralize. But my grandmother knew—mercy overrides justice. I should have
known it, too. Who was Nathan Marx to be such a penny pincher with
kindness? Surely, I thought, the Messiah himself—if He should ever
come—won’t niggle over nickels and dimes. God willing, he’ll hug and
kiss.</p>
<p>The next day, while I was playing softball over on the parade ground,
I decided to ask Bob Wright, who was noncom in charge of Classification
and Assignment, where he thought our trainees would be sent when their
cycle ended, in two weeks. I asked casually, between innings, and he
said, “They’re pushing them all into the Pacific. Shulman cut the orders
on your boys the other day.”</p>
<p>The news shocked me, as though I were the father of Halpern,
Fishbein, and Grossbart.</p>
<p>That night, I was just sliding into sleep when someone tapped on my
door. “Who is it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Sheldon.”</p>
<p>He opened the door and came in. For a moment, I felt his presence
without being able to see him. “How was it?” I asked.</p>
<p>He popped into sight in the near-darkness before me. “Great,
Sergeant.” Then he was sitting on the edge of the bed. I sat up.</p>
<p>“How about you?” he asked. “Have a nice weekend?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“The others went to sleep.” He took a deep, paternal breath. We sat
silent for a while, and a homey feeling invaded my ugly little cubicle;
the door was locked, the cat was out, the children were safely in
bed.</p>
<p>“Sergeant, can I tell you something? Personal?”</p>
<p>I did not answer, and he seemed to know why. “Not about me. About
Mickey. Sergeant, I never felt for anybody like I feel for him. Last
night I heard Mickey in the bed next to me. He was crying so, it could
have broken your heart. Real sobs.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear that.”</p>
<p>“I had to talk to him to stop him. He held my hand, Sergeant—he
wouldn’t let it go. He was almost hysterical. He kept saying if he only
knew where we were going. Even if he knew it was the Pacific, that would
be better than nothing. Just to know.”</p>
<p>Long ago, someone had taught Grossbart the sad rule that only lies
can get the truth. Not that I couldn’t believe in the fact of Halpern’s
crying; his eyes always seemed red-rimmed. But, fact or not, it became a
lie when Grossbart uttered it. He was entirely strategic. But then—it
came with the force of indictment—so was I! There are strategies of
aggression, but there are strategies of retreat as well. And so,
recognizing that I myself had not been without craft and guile, I told
him what I knew. “It is the Pacific.”</p>
<p>He let out a small gasp, which was not a lie. “I’ll tell him. I wish
it was otherwise.”</p>
<p>“So do I.”</p>
<p>He jumped on my words. “You mean you think you could do something? A
change, maybe?”</p>
<p>“No, I couldn’t do a thing.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know anybody over at C. and A.?”</p>
<p>“Grossbart, there’s nothing I can do,” I said. “If your orders are
for the Pacific, then it’s the Pacific.”</p>
<p>“But Mickey—”</p>
<p>“Mickey, you, me—everybody, Grossbart. There’s nothing to be done.
Maybe the war’ll end before you go. Pray for a miracle.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“Good night, Grossbart.” I settled back, and was relieved to feel the
springs unbend as Grossbart rose to leave. I could see him clearly now;
his jaw had dropped, and he looked like a dazed prizefighter. I noticed
for the first time a little paper bag in his hand.</p>
<p>“Grossbart.” I smiled. “My gift?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, Sergeant. Here—from all of us.” He handed me the bag. “It’s
egg roll.”</p>
<p>“Egg roll?” I accepted the bag and felt a damp grease spot on the
bottom. I opened it, sure that Grossbart was joking.</p>
<p>“We thought you’d probably like it. You know—Chinese egg roll. We
thought you’d probably have a taste for—”</p>
<p>“Your aunt served egg roll?”</p>
<p>“She wasn’t home.”</p>
<p>“Grossbart, she invited you. You told me she invited you and your
friends.”</p>
<p>“I know,” he said. “I just reread the letter. Next week.”</p>
<p>I got out of bed and walked to the window. “Grossbart,” I said. But I
was not calling to him.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“What are you, Grossbart? Honest to God, what are you?”</p>
<p>I think it was the first time I’d asked him a question for which he
didn’t have an immediate answer.</p>
<p>“How can you do this to people?” I went on.</p>
<p>“Sergeant, the day away did us all a world of good. Fishbein, you
should see him, he loves Chinese food.”</p>
<p>“But the Seder,” I said.</p>
<p>“We took second best, Sergeant.”</p>
<p>Rage came charging at me. I didn’t sidestep. “Grossbart, you’re a
liar!” I said. “You’re a schemer and a crook. You’ve got no respect for
anything. Nothing at all. Not for me, for the truth—not even for poor
Halpern! You use us all—”</p>
<p>“Sergeant, Sergeant, I feel for Mickey. Honest to God, I do. I love
Mickey. I try—”</p>
<p>“You try! You feel!” I lurched toward him and grabbed his shirt
front. I shook him furiously. “Grossbart, get out! Get out and stay the
hell away from me. Because if I see you, I’ll make your life miserable
You understand that?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I let him free, and when he walked from the room, I wanted to spit on
the floor where he had stood. I couldn’t stop the fury. It engulfed me,
owned me, till it seemed I could only rid myself of it with tears or an
act of violence. I snatched from the bed the bag Grossbart had given me
and, with all my strength, threw it out the window. And the next
morning, as the men policed the area around the barracks, I heard a
great cry go up from one of the trainees, who had been anticipating only
his morning handful of cigarette butts and candy wrappers. “Egg roll!”
he shouted. “Holy Christ, Chinese goddam egg roll!”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>A week later, when I read the orders that had come down from C. and
A., I couldn’t believe my eyes. Every single trainee was to be shipped
to Camp Stoneman, California, and from there to the Pacific—every
trainee but one. Private Sheldon Grossbart. He was to be sent to Fort
Monmouth, New Jersey. I read the mimeographed sheet several times. Dee,
Farrell, Fishbein, Fuselli, Fylypowycz, Glinicki, Gromke, Gucwa,
Halpern, Hardy, Helebrandt, right down to Anton Zygadlo—all were to be
headed West before the month was out. All except Grossbart. He had
pulled a string, and I wasn’t it.</p>
<p>I lifted the phone and called C. and A.</p>
<p>The voice on the other end said smartly, “Corporal Shulman, sir.”</p>
<p>“Let me speak to Sergeant Wright.”</p>
<p>“Who is this calling, sir?”</p>
<p>“Sergeant Marx.”</p>
<p>And, to my surprise, the voice said, “Oh!” Then, “Just a minute,
Sergeant.”</p>
<p>Shulman’s “Oh!” stayed with me while I waited for Wright to come to
the phone. Why “Oh!”? Who was Shulman? And then, so simply, I knew I’d
discovered the string that Grossbart had pulled. In fact, I could hear
Grossbart the day he’d discovered Shulman in the PX, or in the bowling
alley, or maybe even at services. “Glad to meet you. Where you from?
Bronx? Me, too. Do you know So-and-So? And So-and-So? Me, too! You work
at C. and A.? Really? Hey, how’s chances of getting East? Could you do
something? Change something? Swindle, cheat, lie? We gotta help each
other, you know. If the Jews in Germany…”</p>
<p>Bob Wright answered the phone. “How are you, Nate? How’s the pitching
arm?”</p>
<p>“Good. Bob, I wonder if you could do me a favor.” I heard clearly my
own words, and they so reminded me of Grossbart that I dropped more
easily than I could have imagined into what I had planned. “This may
sound crazy, Bob, but I got a kid here on orders to Monmouth who wants
them changed. He had a brother killed in Europe, and he’s hot to go to
the Pacific. Says he’d feel like a coward if he wound up Stateside. I
don’t know, Bob—can anything be done? Put somebody else in the Monmouth
slot?”</p>
<p>“Who?” he asked cagily.</p>
<p>“Anybody. First guy in the alphabet. I don’t care. The kid just asked
if something could be done.”</p>
<p>“What’s his name?”</p>
<p>“Grossbart, Sheldon.”</p>
<p>Wright didn’t answer.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “He’s a Jewish kid, so he thought I could help him
out. You know.”</p>
<p>“I guess I can do something,” he finally said. “The Major hasn’t been
around here for weeks. Temporary duty to the golf course. I’ll try,
Nate, that’s all I can say.”</p>
<p>“I’d appreciate it, Bob. See you Sunday.” And I hung up,
perspiring.</p>
<p>The following day, the corrected orders appeared: Fishbein, Fuselli,
Fylypowycz, Glinicki, Gromke, Grossbart, Gucwa, Halpern, Hardy…Lucky
Private Harley Alton was to go to Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, where, for
some reason or other, they wanted an enlisted man with infantry
training.</p>
<p>After chow that night, I stopped back at the orderly room to
straighten out the guard-duty roster. Grossbart was waiting for me. He
spoke first.</p>
<p>“You son of a bitch!”</p>
<p>I sat down at my desk, and while he glared at me, I began to make the
necessary alterations in the duty roster.</p>
<p>“What do you have against me?” he cried. “Against my family? Would it
kill you for me to be near my father, God knows how many months he has
left to him?”</p>
<p>“Why so?”</p>
<p>“His heart,” Grosshart said. “He hasn’t had enough troubles in a
lifetime, you’ve got to add to them. I curse the day I ever met you,
Marx! Shulman told me what happened over there. There’s no limit to your
anti-Semitism, is there? The damage you’ve done here isn’t enough. You
have to make a special phone call! You really want me dead!”</p>
<p>I made the last few notations in the duty roster and got up to leave.
“Good night, Grossbart.”</p>
<p>“You owe me an explanation!” He stood in my path.</p>
<p>“Sheldon, you’re the one who owes explanations.”</p>
<p>He scowled. “To you?”</p>
<p>“To me, I think so—yes. Mostly to Fishbein and Halpern.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, twist things around. I owe nobody nothing, I’ve done
all I could do for them. Now I think I’ve got the right to watch out for
myself.”</p>
<p>“For each other we have to learn to watch out, Sheldon. You told me
yourself.”</p>
<p>“You call this watching out for me—what you did?”</p>
<p>“No. For all of us.”</p>
<p>I pushed him aside and started for the door. I heard his furious
breathing behind me, and it sounded like steam rushing from an engine of
terrible strength.</p>
<p>“You’ll be all right,” I said from the door. And, I thought, so would
Fishbein and Halpern be all right, even in the Pacific, if only
Grossbart continued to see—in the obsequiousness of the one, the soft
spirituality of the other—some profit for himself.</p>
<p>I stood outside the orderly room, and I heard Grossbart weeping
behind me. Over in the barracks, in the lighted windows, I could see the
boys in their T-shirts sitting on their bunks talking about their
orders, as they’d been doing for the past two days. With a kind of quiet
nervousness, they polished shoes, shined belt buckles, squared away
underwear, trying as best they could to accept their fate. Behind me,
Grossbart swallowed hard, accepting his. And then, resisting with all my
will an impulse to turn and seek pardon for my vindictiveness, I
accepted my own.</p>
