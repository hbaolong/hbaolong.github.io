<h4 id="the-indian-uprising">The Indian Uprising</h4>
<p>By Donald Barthelme (1965)</p>
<p>We defended the city as best we could. The arrows of the Comanches
came in clouds. The war clubs of the Comanches clattered on the soft,
yellow pavements. There were earthworks along the Boulevard Mark Clark
and the hedges had been laced with sparkling wire. People were trying to
understand. I spoke to Sylvia. “Do you think this is a good life?” The
table held apples, books, long playing records. She looked up. “No.”</p>
<p>Patrols of paras and volunteers with armbands guarded the tall, flat
buildings. We interrogated the captured Comanche. Two of us forced his
head back while another poured water into his nostrils. His body jerked,
he choked and wept. Not believing a hurried, careless, and exaggerated
report of the number of casualties in the outer districts where trees,
lamps, swans had been reduced to clear fields of fire we issued
entrenching tools to those who seemed trustworthy and turned the
heavy-weapons companies so that we could not be surprised from that
direction. And I sat there getting drunker and drunker and more in love
and more in love. We talked.</p>
<p>“Do you know Fauré’s ‘Dolly’?”</p>
<p>“Would that be Gabriel Fauré?”</p>
<p>“It would.”</p>
<p>“Then I know it,” she said. “May I say that I play it myself at
certain times, when I am sad, or happy, although it requires four
hands.”</p>
<p>“How is that managed?”</p>
<p>“I accelerate,” she said, “ignoring the time signature.”</p>
<p>And when they shot the scene in the bed I wondered how you felt under
the eyes of the cameramen, grips, juicers, men in the mixing booth:
excited? stimulated? And when they shot the scene in the shower I sanded
a hollow-core door working carefully against the illustrations in texts
and whispered instructions from one who had already solved the problem.
I had made after all other tables, one while living with Nancy, one
while living with Alice, one while living with Eunice, one while living
with Marianne.</p>
<p>Red men in waves like people scattering in a square startled by
something tragic or a sudden, loud noise accumulated against the
barricades we had made of window dummies, silk, thoughtfully planned job
descriptions (including scales for the orderly progress of other
colors), wine in demijohns, and robes. I analyzed the composition of the
barricade nearest me and found two ashtrays, ceramic, one dark brown and
one dark brown with an orange blur at the lip; a tin frying pan;
two-litre bottles of red wine; three quarter-litre bottles of Black
andandandand White, aquavit, cognac, vodka, gin, Fad #6 sherry; a
hollow-core door in birch veneer on black wrought-iron legs; a blanket,
red-orange with faint blue stripes; a red pillow and a blue pillow; a
woven straw wastebasket; two glass jars for flowers; corkscrews and can
openers; two plates and two cups, ceramic, dark brown; a
yellow-and-purple poster; a Yugoslavian carved flute, wood, dark brown;
and other items. I decided I knew nothing.</p>
<p>The hospitals dusted wounds with powders the worth of which was not
quite established, other supplies having been exhausted early in the
first day. I decided I knew nothing. Friends put me in touch with a Miss
R., a teacher, unorthodox they said, excellent they said, successful
with difficult cases, steel shutters on the windows made her house safe.
I had just learned via an International Distress Coupon that Jane had
been beaten up by a dwarf in a bar in Tenerife but Miss R. did not allow
me to speak of it. “You know nothing,” she said, “you feel nothing, you
are locked in a most savage and terrible ignorance, I despise you, my
boy, mon cher, my heart. You may attend but you must not attend now, you
must attend later, a day or a week or an hour, you are making me ill…” I
nonevaluated these remarks as Korzybski instructed. But it was
difficult. Then they pulled back in a feint near the river and we rushed
into that sector with a reinforced battalion hastily formed among the
Zouaves and cab drivers. This unit was crushed in the afternoon of a day
that began with spoons and letters in hallways and under windows where
men tasted the history of the heart, cone-shaped muscular organ that
maintains circulation of the blood.</p>
<p>But it is you I want now, here in the middle of this Uprising, with
the streets yellow and threatening, short, ugly lances with fur at the
throat and inexplicable shell money lying in the grass. It is when I am
with you that I am happiest, and it is for you that I am making this
hollow-core door table with black wrought-iron legs. I held Sylvia by
her bear-claw necklace. “Call off your braves,” I said. “We have many
years left to live.” There was a sort of muck running in the gutters,
yellowish, filthy stream suggesting excrement, or nervousness, a city
that does not know what it has done to deserve baldness, errors,
infidelity. “With luck you will survive until matins,” Sylvia said. She
ran off down the Rue Chester Nimitz, uttering shrill cries.</p>
<p>Then it was learned that they had infiltrated our ghetto and that the
people of the ghetto instead of offering resistance had joined the
smooth, well coordinated attack with zip guns, telegrams, lockets,
causing that portion of the line held by the I.R.A. to swell and
collapse. We sent more heroin into the ghetto, and hyacinths, ordering
another hundred thousand of the pale, delicate flowers. On the map we
considered the situation with its strung-out inhabitants and merely
personal emotions. Our parts were blue and their parts were green. I
showed the blue-and-green map to Sylvia. “Your parts are green,” I said.
“You gave me heroin first a year ago,” Sylvia said. She ran off down
George C. Marshall Allée, uttering shrill cries. Miss R. pushed me into
a large room painted white (jolting and dancing in the soft light, and I
was excited! and there were people watching!) in which there were two
chairs. I sat in one chair and Miss R. sat in the other. She wore a blue
dress containing a red figure. There was nothing exceptional about her.
I was disappointed by her plainness, by the bareness of the room, by the
absence of books.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The girls of my quarter wore long blue mufflers that reached to their
knees. Sometimes the girls hid Comanches in their rooms, the blue
mufflers together in a room creating a great blue fog. Block opened the
door. He was carrying weapons, flowers, and loaves of bread. And he was
friendly, kind, enthusiastic, so I related a little of the history of
torture, reviewing the technical literature quoting the best modern
sources, French, German, and American, and pointing out the flies which
had gathered in anticipation of some new, cool color.</p>
<p>“What is the situation?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The situation is liquid,” he said. “We hold the south quarter and
they hold the north quarter. The rest is silence.”</p>
<p>“And Kenneth?”</p>
<p>“That girl is not in love with Kenneth,” Block said frankly. “She is
in love with his coat. When she is not wearing it she is huddling under
it. Once I caught it going down the stairs by itself. I looked inside.
Sylvia.”</p>
<p>Once I caught Kenneth’s coat going down the stairs by itself but the
coat was a trap and inside a Comanche who made a thrust with his short,
ugly knife at my leg which buckled and tossed me over the balustrade
through a window and into another situation. Not believing that your
body brilliant as it was and your fat, liquid spirit distinguished and
angry as it was were stable quantities to which one could return on
wires more than once, twice, or another number of times I said: “See the
table?”</p>
<p>In Skinny Wainwright Square the forces of green and blue swayed and
struggled. The referees ran out on the field trailing chains. And then
the blue part would be enlarged, the green diminished. Miss R. began to
speak. “A former king of Spain, a Bonaparte, lived for a time in
Bordentown, New Jersey. But that’s no good.” She paused. “The ardor
aroused in men by the beauty of women can only be satisfied by God.</p>
<p>That is very good (it is Valéry) but it is not what I have to teach
you, goat, muck, filth, heart of my heart.” I showed the table to Nancy.
“See the table?” She stuck out her tongue red as a cardinal’s hat. “I
made such a table once,” Block said frankly. “People all over America
have made such tables. I doubt very much whether one can enter an
American home without finding at least one such table, or traces of its
having been there, such as faded places in the carpet.” And afterward in
the garden the men of the 7th Cavalry played Gabrieli, Albinoni,
Marcello, Vivaldi, Boccherini. I saw Sylvia. She wore a yellow ribbon,
under a long blue muffler. “Which side are you on,” I cried, “after
all?”</p>
<p>“The only form of discourse of which I approve,” Miss R. said in her
dry, sack voice, “is the litany. I believe our masters and teachers as
well as plain citizens should confine themselves to what can safely be
said. Thus when I hear the words pewter, snake, tea, Fad #6 sherry,
serviette, fenestration, crown, blue coming from the mouth of some
public official, or some raw youth, I am not disappointed. Vertical
organization is also possible,” Miss R. said, “as in</p>
<pre><code>            pewter</code></pre>
<p>snake</p>
<p>tea</p>
<p>Fad #6 sherry</p>
<p>serviette</p>
<p>fenestration</p>
<p>crown</p>
<p>blue.</p>
<p>I run to liquids and colors,” she said, “but you, you may run to
something else, my virgin, my darling, my thistle, my poppet, my own.
Young people,” Miss R. said, “run to more and more unpleasant
combinations as they sense the nature of our society. Some people,” Miss
R. said, “run to conceits or wisdom but I hold to the hard, brown,
nutlike word. I might point out that there is enough aesthetic
excitement here to satisfy anyone but a damned fool.” I sat in solemn
silence.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Fire arrows lit my way to the post office in Patton Place where
members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade offered their last, exhausted
letters, postcards, calendars. I opened a letter but inside was a
Comanche flint arrowhead played by Frank Wedekind in an elegant gold
chain and congratulations. Your earring rattled against my spectacles
when I leaned forward to touch the soft, ruined place where the hearing
aid had been. “Pack it up! Pack it up!” I urged, but the men in charge
of the Uprising refused to listen to reason or to understand that it was
real and that our water supply had evaporated and that our credit was no
longer what it had been, once.</p>
<p>We attached wires to the testicles of the captured Comanche. And I
sat there getting drunker and drunker and more in love and more in love.
When we threw the switch he spoke. His name, he said, was Gustave
Aschenbach. He was born at L——, a country town in the province of
Silesia. He was the son of an upper official in the judicature, and his
forebears had all been officers, judges, departmental functionaries….
And you can never touch a girl in the same way more than once, twice, or
another number of times however much you may wish to hold, wrap, or
otherwise fix her hand, or look, or some other quality, or incident,
known to you previously. In Sweden the little Swedish children cheered
when we managed nothing more remarkable than getting off a bus burdened
with packages, bread and liver paste and beer. We went to an old church
and sat in the royal box. The organist was practicing. And then into the
graveyard next to the church. Here lies Anna Pedersen, a good woman. I
threw a mushroom on the grave. The officer commanding the garbage dump
reported by radio that the garbage had begun to move.</p>
<p>Jane! I heard via an International Distress Coupon that you were
beaten up by a dwarf in a bar in Tenerife. That doesn’t sound like you,
Jane. Mostly you kick the dwarf in his little dwarf groin before he can
get his teeth into your tasty and nice-looking leg, don’t you, Jane?
Your affair with Harold is reprehensible, you know that, don’t you,
Jane? Harold is married to Nancy. And there is Paula to think about
(Harold’s kid), and Billy (Harold’s other kid). I think your values are
peculiar, Jane! Strings of language extend in every direction to bind
the world into a rushing, seamless whole.</p>
<p>And you can never return to felicities in the same way, the brilliant
body, the distinguished spirit recapitulating moments that occur once,
twice, or another number of times in rebellions, or water. The rolling
consensus of the Comanche nation smashed our inner defenses on three
sides. Block was firing a grease gun from the upper floor of a building
designed by Emery Roth andandandand Sons. “See the table?” “Oh, pack it
up with your bloody table!” The city officials were tied to trees. Dusky
warriors padded with their forest tread into the mouth of the mayor.
“Who do you want to be?” I asked Kenneth and he said he wanted to be
Jean-Luc Godard but later when time permitted conversations in large,
lighted rooms, whispering galleries with black-and-white Spanish rugs
and problematic sculptures on calm, red catafalques. The sickness of the
quarrel lay thick in the bed. I touched your back, the white, raised
scars.</p>
<p>We killed a great many in the south suddenly with helicopters and
rockets but we found that those we had killed were children and more
came from the north and from the east and from other places where there
are children preparing to live. “Skin,” Miss R. said softly in the
white, yellow room. “This is the Clemency Committee. And would you
remove your belt and shoelaces.” I removed my belt and shoelaces and
looked (rain shattering from a great height the prospects of silence and
clear, neat rows of houses in the subdivisions) into their savage black
eyes, paint, feathers, beads.</p>
