<h4 id="where-is-the-voice-coming-from">Where Is the Voice Coming
From?</h4>
<p>By Eudora Welty (1963)</p>
<p>I says to my wife, “You can reach and turn it off. You don’t have to
set and look at a black nigger face no longer than you want to, or
listen to what you don’t want to hear. It’s still a free country.”</p>
<p>I reckon that’s how I give myself the idea.</p>
<p>I says, I could find right exactly where in Thermopylae that nigger’s
living that’s asking for equal time. And without a bit of trouble to
me.</p>
<p>And I ain’t saying it might not be because that’s pretty close to
where I live. The other hand, there could be reasons you might have
yourself for knowing how to get there in the dark. It’s where you all go
for the thing you want when you want it the most. Ain’t that right?</p>
<p>The Branch Bank sign tells you in lights, all night long even, what
time it is and how hot. When it was quarter to four, and 92, that was me
going by in my brother-in-law’s truck. He don’t deliver nothing at that
hour of the morning.</p>
<p>So you leave Four Corners and head west on Nathan B. Forrest Road,
past the Surplus andandandand Salvage, not much beyond the Kum Back
Drive-In and Trailer Camp, not as far as where the signs starts saying
“Live Bait,” “Used Parts,” “Fireworks,” “Peaches,” and “Sister Peebles
Reader and Adviser.” Turn before you hit the city limits and duck back
towards the I.C. tracks. And his street’s been paved.</p>
<p>And there was his light on, waiting for me. In his garage, if you
please. His car’s gone. He’s out planning still some other ways to do
what we tell ’em they can’t. I thought I’d beat him home. All I had to
do was pick my tree and walk in close behind it.</p>
<p>I didn’t come expecting not to wait. But it was so hot, all I did was
hope and pray one or the other of us wouldn’t melt before it was
over.</p>
<p>Now, it wasn’t no bargain I’d struck.</p>
<p>I’ve heard what you’ve heard about Goat Dykeman, in Mississippi.
Sure, everybody knows about Goat Dykeman. Goat he got word to the
Governor’s Mansion he’d go up yonder and shoot that nigger Meredith
clean out of school, if he’s let out of the pen to do it. Old Ross
turned that over in his mind before saying him nay, it stands to
reason.</p>
<p>I ain’t no Goat Dykeman, I ain’t in no pen, and I ain’t ask no
Governor Barnett to give me one thing. Unless he wants to give me a pat
on the back for the trouble I took this morning. But he don’t have to if
he don’t want to. I done what I done for my own pure-D satisfaction.</p>
<p>As soon as I heard wheels, I knowed who was coming. That was him and
bound to be him. It was the right nigger heading in a new white car up
his driveway towards his garage with the light shining, but stopping
before he got there, maybe not to wake ’em. That was him. I knowed it
when he cut off the car lights and put his foot out and I knowed him
standing dark against the light. I knowed him then like I know me now. I
knowed him even by his still, listening back.</p>
<p>Never seen him before, never seen him since, never seen anything of
his black face but his picture, never seen his face alive, any time at
all, or anywheres, and didn’t want to, need to, never hope to see that
face and never will. As long as there was no question in my mind.</p>
<p>He had to be the one. He stood right still and waited against the
light, his back was fixed, fixed on me like a preacher’s eyeballs when
he’s yelling “Are you saved?” He’s the one.</p>
<p>I’d already brought up my rifle, I’d already taken my sights. And I’d
already got him, because it was too late then for him or me to turn by
one hair.</p>
<p>Something darker than him, like the wings of a bird, spread on his
back and pulled him down. He climbed up once, like a man under bad
claws, and like just blood could weigh a ton he walked with it on his
back to better light. Didn’t get no further than his door. And fell to
stay.</p>
<p>He was down. He was down, and a ton load of bricks on his back
wouldn’t have laid any heavier. There on his paved driveway, yes
sir.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t till the minute before, that the mockingbird had quit
singing. He’d been singing up my sassafras tree. Either he was up early,
or he hadn’t never gone to bed, he was like me. And the mocker he’d
stayed right with me, filling the air till come the crack, till I turned
loose of my load. I was like him. I was on top of the world myself. For
once.</p>
<p>I stepped to the edge of his light there, where he’s laying flat. I
says, “Roland? There was one way left, for me to be ahead of you and
stay ahead of you, by Dad, and I just taken it. Now I’m alive and you
ain’t. We ain’t never now, never going to be equals and you know why?
One of us is dead. What about that, Roland?” I said. “Well, you seen to
it, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>I stood a minute—just to see would somebody inside come out long
enough to pick him up. And there she comes, the woman. I doubt she’d
been to sleep. Because it seemed to me she’d been in there keeping awake
all along.</p>
<p>It was mighty green where I skint over the yard getting back. That
nigger wife of his, she wanted nice grass! I bet my wife would hate to
pay her water bill. And for burning her electricity. And there’s my
brother-in-law’s truck, still waiting with the door open.</p>
<p>“No Riders”—that didn’t mean me.</p>
<p>There wasn’t a thing I been able to think of since would have made it
to go any nicer. Except a chair to my back while I was putting in my
waiting. But going home, I seen what little time it takes after all to
get a thing done like you really want it. It was 4:34, and while I was
looking it moved to 35. And the temperature stuck where it was. All that
night I guarantee you it had stood without dropping, a good 92.</p>
<p>My wife says, “What? Didn’t the skeeters bite you?” She said, “Well,
they been asking that—why somebody didn’t trouble to load a rifle and
get some of these agitators out of Thermopylae. Didn’t the fella keep
drumming it in, what a good idea? The one that writes a column
ever’day?”</p>
<p>I says to my wife, “Find some way I don’t get the credit.”</p>
<p>“He says do it for Thermopylae,” she says. “Don’t you ever skim the
paper?”</p>
<p>I says, “Thermopylae never done nothing for me. And I don’t owe
nothing to Thermopylae. Didn’t do it for you. Hell, any more’n I’d do
something or other for them Kennedys! I done it for my own pure-D
satisfaction.”</p>
<p>“It’s going to get him right back on TV,” says my wife. “You watch
for the funeral.”</p>
<p>I says, “You didn’t even leave a light burning when you went to bed.
So how was I supposed to even get me home or pull Buddy’s truck up safe
in our front yard?”</p>
<p>“Well, hear another good joke on you,” my wife says next. “Didn’t you
hear the news? The N. double A. C. P. is fixing to send somebody to
Thermopylae. Why couldn’t you waited? You might could have got you
somebody better. Listen and hear ’em say so.”</p>
<p>I ain’t but one. I reckon you have to tell somebody.</p>
<p>“Where’s the gun, then?” my wife says. “What did you do with our
protection?”</p>
<p>I says, “It was scorching! It was scorching!” I told her, “It’s
laying out on the ground in rank weeds, trying to cool off, that’s what
it’s doing now.”</p>
<p>“You dropped it,” she says. “Back there.”</p>
<p>And I told her, “Because I’m so tired of ever’thing in the world
being just that hot to the touch! The keys to the truck, the doorknob,
the bedsheet, ever’thing, it’s all like a stove lid. There just ain’t
much going that’s worth holding onto it no more,” I says, “when it’s a
hundred and two in the shade by day and by night not too much
difference. I wish you’d laid your finger to that gun.”</p>
<p>“Trust you to come off and leave it,” my wife says.</p>
<p>“Is that how no-’count I am?” she makes me ask. “You want to go back
and get it?”</p>
<p>“You’re the one they’ll catch. I say it’s so hot that even if you get
to sleep you wake up feeling like you cried all night!” says my wife.
“Cheer up, here’s one more joke before time to get up. Heard what
Caroline said? Caroline said, ’Daddy, I just can’t wait to grow up big,
so I can marry James Meredith. I heard that where I work. One rich-bitch
to another one, to make her cackle.”</p>
<p>“At least I kept some dern teen-ager from North Thermopylae getting
there and doing it first,” I says. “Driving his own car.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>On TV and in the paper, they don’t know but half of it. They know who
Roland Summers was without knowing who I am. His face was in front of
the public before I got rid of him, and after I got rid of him there it
is again—the same picture. And none of me. I ain’t ever had one made.
Not ever! The best that newspaper could do for me was offer a
five-hundred-dollar reward for finding out who I am. For as long as they
don’t know who that is, whoever shot Roland is worth a good deal more
right now than Roland is.</p>
<p>But by the time I was moving around uptown, it was hotter still. That
pavement in the middle of Main Street was so hot to my feet I might’ve
been walking the barrel of my gun. If the whole world could’ve just felt
Main Street this morning through the soles of my shoes, maybe it
would’ve helped some.</p>
<p>Then the first thing I heard ’em say was the N. double A. C. P. done
it themselves, killed Roland Summers, and proved it by saying the
shooting was done by an expert (I hope to tell you it was!) and at just
the right hour and minute to get the whites in trouble.</p>
<p>You can’t win.</p>
<p>“They’ll never find him,” the old man trying to sell roasted peanuts
tells me to my face.</p>
<p>And it’s so hot.</p>
<p>It looks like the town’s on fire already, whichever ways you turn,
ever’ street you strike, because there’s those trees hanging them pones
of bloom like split watermelon. And a thousand cops crowding ever’where
you go, half of ’em too young to start shaving, but all streaming sweat
alike. I’m getting tired of ’em.</p>
<p>I was already tired of seeing a hundred cops getting us white people
nowheres. Back at the beginning, I stood on the corner and I watched
them new babyface cops loading nothing but nigger children into the
paddy wagon and they come marching out of a little parade and into the
paddy wagon singing. And they got in and sat down without providing a
speck of trouble, and their hands held little new American flags, and
all the cops could do was knock them flagsticks a-loose from their
hands, and not let ’em pick ’em up, that was all, and give ’em a free
ride. And children can just get ’em more flags.</p>
<p>Everybody: It don’t get you nowhere to take nothing from nobody
unless you make sure it’s for keeps, for good and all, for ever and
amen.</p>
<p>I won’t be sorry to see them brickbats hail down on us for a change.
Pop bottles too, they can come flying whenever they want to. Hundreds,
all to smash, like Birmingham. I’m waiting on ’em to bring out them
switchblade knives, like Harlem and Chicago. Watch TV long enough and
you’ll see it all to happen on Deacon Street in Thermopylae. What’s
holding it back, that’s all?—Because it’s in ’em.</p>
<p>I’m ready myself for that funeral.</p>
<p>Oh, they may find me. May catch me one day in spite of ’emselves.
(But I grew up in the country.) May try to railroad me into the electric
chair, and what that amounts to is something hotter than yesterday and
today put together.</p>
<p>But I advise ’em to go careful. Ain’t it about time us taxpayers
starts to calling the moves? Starts to telling the teachers and the
preachers and the judges of our so-called courts how far they can
go?</p>
<p>Even the President so far, he can’t walk in my house without being
invited, like he’s my daddy, just to say whoa. Not yet!</p>
<p>Once, I run away from my home. And there was a ad for me, come to be
printed in our county weekly. My mother paid for it. It was from her. It
says: “Son: You are not being hunted for anything but to find you.” That
time, I come on back home.</p>
<p>But people are dead now.</p>
<p>And it’s so hot. Without it even being August yet.</p>
<p>Anyways, I seen him fall. I was evermore the one.</p>
<p>So I reach me down my old guitar off the nail in the wall. ’Cause
I’ve got my guitar, what I’ve held onto from way back when, and I never
dropped that, never lost or forgot it, never hocked it but to get it
again, never give it away, and I set in my chair, with nobody home but
me, and I start to play, and sing a-Down. And sing a-down, down, down,
down. Sing a-down, down, down, down. Down.</p>
