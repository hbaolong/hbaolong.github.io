<h4 id="my-father-addresses-me-on-the-facts-of-old-age">My Father
Addresses Me on the Facts of Old Age</h4>
<p>By Grace Paley (2002)</p>
<p>My father had decided to teach me how to grow old. I said O.K. My
children didn’t think it was such a great idea. If I knew how, they
thought, I might do so too easily. No, no, I said, it’s for later, years
from now. And, besides, if I get it right it might be helpful to you
kids in time to come.</p>
<p>They said, Really?</p>
<p>My father wanted to begin as soon as possible. For God’s sake, he
said, you can talk to the kids later. Now, listen to me, send them out
to play. You are so distractable.</p>
<p>We should probably begin at the beginning, he said. Change. First
there is change, which nobody likes—even men. You’d be surprised. You
can do little things—putting cream on the corners of your mouth, also
the heels of your feet. But here is the main thing. Oh, I wish your
mother was alive—not that she had time—</p>
<p>But Pa, I said, Mama never knew anything about cream. I did not say
she was famous for not taking care.</p>
<p>Forget it, he said sadly. But I must mention squinting. Don’t Squint.
Wear your glasses. Look at your aunt, so beautiful once. I know someone
has said men don’t make passes at girls who wear glasses, but that’s an
idea for a foolish person. There are many handsome women who are not
exactly twenty-twenty.</p>
<p>Please sit down, he said. Be patient. The main thing is this—when you
get up in the morning you must take your heart in your two hands. You
must do this every morning.</p>
<p>That’s a metaphor, right?</p>
<p>Metaphor? No, no, you can do this. In the morning, do a few little
exercises for the joints, not too much. Then put your hands like a cup
over and under the heart. Under the breast, he said tactfully. It’s
probably easier for a man. Then talk softly, don’t yell. Under your
ribs, push a little. When you wake up, you must do this massage. I mean
pat, stroke a little, don’t be ashamed. Very likely no one will be
watching. Then you must talk to your heart.</p>
<p>Talk? What?</p>
<p>Say anything, but be respectful. Say—maybe say, Heart, little heart,
beat softly but never forget your job, the blood. You can whisper also,
Remember, remember. For instance, I said to it yesterday, Heart, heart,
do you remember my brother, Grisha, how he made work for you that day
when he came to the store and he said, Your boss’s money, Zenya, right
now? How he put a gun in my face and I said, Grisha, are you crazy? Why
don’t you ask me at home? I would give you. We were in this America not
more than two years. He was only a kid. And he said, he said, Who needs
your worker’s money? For the movement—only from your boss. O little
heart, you worked like a bastard, like a dog, like a crazy slave, bang,
bang, bang that day, remember? That’s the story I told my heart
yesterday, my father said. What a racket it made to answer me, I
remember, I remember, till I was dizzy with the thumping.</p>
<p>Why’d you do that, Pa? I don’t get it.</p>
<p>Don’t you see? This is good for the old heart—to get excited—just as
good as for the person. Some people go running till late in life—for the
muscles, they say, but the heart knows the real purpose. The purpose is
the expansion of the arteries, a river of blood, it cleans off the
banks, carries junk out of the system. I myself would rather remind the
heart how frightened I was by my brother than go running in a strange
neighborhood, miles and miles, with the city so dangerous these
days.</p>
<p>I said, Oh, but then I said, Well, thanks.</p>
<p>I don’t think you listened, he said. As usual—probably worried about
the kids. They’re not babies, you know. If you were better organized you
wouldn’t have so many worries.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>I stopped by a couple of weeks later. This time he was annoyed.</p>
<p>Why did you leave the kids home? If you keep doing this, they’ll
forget who I am. Children are like old people in that respect.</p>
<p>They won’t forget you, Pa, never in a million years.</p>
<p>You think so? God has not been so good about a million years. His
main interest in us began—actually, he put it down in writing fifty-six,
fifty-seven hundred years ago. In the Book. You know our Book, I
suppose.</p>
<p>O.K. Yes.</p>
<p>Probably a million years is too close to his lifetime, if you could
call it life, what he goes through. I believe he said several times—when
he was still in contact with us—I am a jealous God. Here and there he
makes an exception. I read there are three-thousand-year-old trees
somewhere in some godforsaken place. Of course, that’s how come they’re
still alive. We should all be so godforsaken.</p>
<p>But no more joking around. I have been thinking what to tell you now.
First of all, soon, maybe in twenty, thirty years, you’ll begin to get
up in the morning—4, 5 a.m. In a farmer that’s O.K., but for us—you’ll
remember everything you did, didn’t, what you omitted, whom you
insulted, betrayed—betrayed, that is the worst. Do you remember, you
didn’t go see your aunt, she was dying? That will be on your mind like a
stone. Of course, I myself did not behave so well. Still, I was so busy
those days, long office hours, remember it was usual in those days for
doctors to make house calls. No elevators, fourth floor, fifth floor,
even in a nice Bronx tenement. But this morning, I mean this morning, a
few hours ago, my mother, your babushka, came into my mind, looked at
me.</p>
<p>Have I told you I was arrested? Of course I did. I was arrested a few
times, but this time for some reason the policeman walked me past the
office of the local jail. My mama was there. I saw her through the
window. She was bringing me a bundle of clean clothes. She put it on the
officer’s table. She turned. She saw me. She looked at me through the
glass with such a face, eye-to-eye. Despair. No hope. This morning, 4
a.m., I saw once more how she sat there, very straight. Her eyes.
Because of that look, I did my term, my sentence, the best I could. I
finished up six months in Arkhangel’sk, where they finally sent me. Then
no more, no more, I said to myself, no more saving Imperial Russia, the
great pogrom-maker, from itself.</p>
<p>Oh, Pa.</p>
<p>Don’t make too much out of everything. Well, anyway, I want to tell
you also how the body is your enemy. I must warn you it is not your
friend the way it was when you were a youngster. For example.
Greens—believe me—are overrated. Some people believe they will cure
cancer. It’s the style. My experience with maybe a hundred patients
proves otherwise. Greens are helpful to God. That fellow Sandburg, the
poet—I believe from Chicago—explained it. Grass tiptoes over the whole
world, holds it in place—except the desert, of course, everything there
is loose, flying around.</p>
<p>How come you bring up God so much? When I was a kid you were a strict
atheist, you even spit on the steps of the synagogue.</p>
<p>Well, God is very good for conversation, he said. By the way, I
believe I have to tell you a few words about the stock market. Your
brother-in-law is always talking about how brilliant he is, investing,
investing. My advice to you: Stay out of it.</p>
<p>But people are making money. A lot. Read the paper. Even kids are
becoming millionaires.</p>
<p>But what of tomorrow? he asked.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I said, they’ll make another million.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I mean tomorrow. I was there when tomorrow came in 1929.
So I say to them and their millions, Ha ha ha, tomorrow will come. Go
home now, I have a great deal more to tell you. Somehow, I’m always
tired.</p>
<p>I’ll go in a minute—but I have to tell you something, Pa. I had to
tell him that my husband and I were separating. Maybe even divorce, the
first in the family.</p>
<p>What? What? Are you crazy? I don’t understand you people nowadays. I
married your mother when I was a boy. It’s true I had a first-class
mustache, but I was a kid, and you know I stayed married till the end.
Once or twice, she wanted to part company, but not me. The reason, of
course, she was inclined to be jealous.</p>
<p>He then gave me the example I’d heard five or six times before. What
it was, one time two couples went to the movies. Arzemich and his wife,
you remember. Well, I sat next to his wife, the lady of the couple, by
the way a very attractive woman, and during the show, which wasn’t so
great, we talked about this and that, laughed a couple times. When we
got home, your mother said, O.K. Anytime you want, right now, I’ll give
you a divorce. We will go our separate ways. Naturally, I said, What?
Are you ridiculous?</p>
<p>My advice to you—stick it out. It’s true your husband, he’s a
peculiar fellow, but think it over. Go home. Maybe you can manage at
least till old age. Then, if you still don’t get along, you can go to
separate old-age homes.</p>
<p>Pa, it’s no joke. It’s my life.</p>
<p>It is a joke. A joke is necessary at this time. But I’m tired.</p>
<p>You’ll see, in thirty, forty years from now, you’ll get tired often.
It doesn’t mean you’re sick. This is something important that I’m
telling you. Listen. To live a long time, long years, you’ve got to
sleep a certain extra percentage away. It’s a shame.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>It was at least three weeks before I saw him again. He was drinking
tea, eating a baked apple, one of twelve my sister baked for him every
ten days. I took another one out of the refrigerator. “Fathers and Sons”
was on the kitchen table. Most of the time he read history. He kept
Gibbon and Prescott on the lamp stand next to his resting chair. But
this time, thinking about Russia for some reason in a kindly way, he was
reading Turgenev.</p>
<p>You were probably pretty busy, he said. Where are the kids? With the
father? He looked at me hopefully.</p>
<p>No hope, Pa.</p>
<p>By the way, you know, this fellow Turgenev? He wasn’t a showoff. He
wrote a certain book, and he became famous right away. One day he went
to Paris, and in the evening he went to the opera. He stepped into his
box, and just as he was sitting down the people began to applaud. The
whole opera house was clapping. He was known. Everybody knew his book.
He said, I see Russia is known in France.</p>
<p>You’re a lucky girl that these books are in the living room, more on
the table than on the shelf.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Excuse me, also about Turgenev, I don’t believe he was an
anti-Semite. Of course, most of them were, even if they had brains. I
don’t think Gorky was, Gogol probably. Tolstoy, no, Tolstoy had an
opinion about the Mexican-American War. Did you know? Of course, most
were anti-Semites. Dostoyevsky. It was natural, it seems. Ach, why is it
we read them with such interest and they don’t return the favor?</p>
<p>That’s what women writers say about men writers.</p>
<p>Please don’t start in. I’m in the middle of telling you some things
you don’t know. Well, I suppose you do know a number of Gentiles, you’re
more in the American world. I know very few. Still, I was telling
you—Jews were not allowed to travel in Russia. I told you that. But a
Jewish girl if she was a prostitute could go anywhere throughout all
Russia. Also a Jew if he was a merchant first class. Even people with
big stores were only second class. Who else? A soldier who had a medal,
I think St. George. Do you know nobody could arrest him? Even if he was
a Jew. If he killed someone a policeman could not arrest him. He wore a
certain hat. Why am I telling you all this?</p>
<p>Well, it is interesting.</p>
<p>Yes, but I’m supposed to tell you a few things, give advice, a few
last words. Of course, the fact is I am obliged because you are always
getting yourself mixed up in politics. Because your mother and I were
such radical kids—socialists—in constant trouble with the police—it was
1904, 5. You have the idea it’s O.K. for you and it is not O.K. in this
country, which is a democracy. And you’re running in the street like a
fool. Your cousin saw you a few years ago in school, suspended. Sitting
with other children in the auditorium, not allowed to go to class. You
thought Mama and I didn’t know.</p>
<p>Pa, that was thirty-five years ago, in high school. Anyway, what
about Mama? You mentioned the Arzemich family. She was a dentist, wasn’t
she?</p>
<p>Right, a very capable woman.</p>
<p>Well, Mama probably felt bad about not getting to school and, you
know, becoming something, having a profession like Mrs. What’s-Her-Name.
I mean, she did run the whole house and family and the office and people
coming to live with us, but she was sad about that, surely.</p>
<p>He was quiet. Then he said, You’re right. It was a shame, everything
went into me, so I should go to school, I should graduate, I should be
the doctor, I should have the profession. Poor woman, she was extremely
smart. At least as smart as me. In Russia, in the movement, you know,
when we were youngsters, she was considered the more valuable person.
Very steady, honest. Made first-class contact with the workers, a real
organizer. I could be only an intellectual. But maybe if life didn’t
pass so quick, speedy, like a winter day—short. You know, also, she was
very musical, she had perfect pitch. A few years ago your sister made
similar remarks to me about Mama. Questioning me, like history is my
fault. Your brother only looked at me the way he does—not with complete
approval.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Then one day my father surprised me. He said he wanted to talk a
little, but not too much, about love or sex or whatever it’s called—its
troubling persistence. He said that might happen to me, too, eventually.
It should not be such a surprise. Then, a little accusingly, After all,
I have been a man alone for many years. Did you ever think about that?
Maybe I suffered. Did it even enter your mind? You’re a grownup woman,
after all.</p>
<p>But Pa, I wouldn’t ever have thought of bringing up anything like
that—you and Mama were so damn puritanical. I never heard you say the
word “sex” till this day—either of you.</p>
<p>We were serious Socialists, he said. So? He looked at me, raising one
nice thick eyebrow. You don’t understand politics too well, do you?</p>
<p>Actually, I had thought of it now and then, his sexual aloneness. I
was a grownup woman. But I turned it into a tactful question: Aren’t you
sometimes lonely, Pa?</p>
<p>I have a nice apartment.</p>
<p>Then he closed his eyes. He rested his talking self. I decided to
water the plants. He opened one eye. Take it easy. Don’t overwater.</p>
<p>Anyway, he said, only your mother, a person like her, could put up
with me. Her patience—you know, I was always losing my temper. But
finally with us everything was all right, all right, accomplished. Do
you understand? Your brother and sister finished college, married. We
had a beautiful grandchild. I was working very hard, like a dog. We were
only fifty years old then, but, look, we bought the place in the
country. Your sister and brother came often. You yourself were running
around with a dozen kids in bathing suits all day. Your mama was
planting all kinds of flowers every minute. Trees were growing. Your
grandma, your babushka, sat on a good chair on the lawn. In back of her
were birch trees. I put in a nice row of spruce. Then one day in the
morning she comes to me, my wife. She shows me a spot over her left
breast. I know right away. I don’t touch it. I see it. In my mind I turn
it this way and that. But I know in that minute, in one minute,
everything is finished, finished—happiness, pleasure, finished, years
ahead black.</p>
<p>No. That minute had been told to me a couple of years ago, maybe
twice in ten years. Each time it nearly stopped my heart. No.</p>
<p>He recovered from the telling. Now, listen, this means, of course,
that you should take care of yourself. I don’t mean eat vegetables. I
mean go to the doctor on time. Nowadays a woman as sick as your mama
could live many years. Your sister, for example, after terrible
operations—heart bypass, colon cancer—more she probably hides from me.
She is running around to theatre, concerts, probably supports Lincoln
Center. Ballet, chamber, symphony—three, four times a week. But you must
pay attention. One good thing, don’t laugh, is bananas. Really.
Potassium. I myself eat one every day.</p>
<p>But, seriously, I’m running out of advice. It’s too late to beg you
to finish school, get a couple of degrees, a decent profession, be a
little more strict with the children. They should be prepared for the
future. Maybe they won’t be as lucky as you. Well, no more advice. I
restrain myself.</p>
<p>Now I’m changing the whole subject. I will ask you a favor. You have
many friends—teachers, writers, intelligent people. Jews, non-Jews.
These days I think often, especially after telling you the story a
couple of months ago, about my brother Grisha. I want to know what
happened to him.</p>
<p>I guess we know he was deported around 1922, right?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, but why did they go after him? The last ten years before
that, he calmed down quite a bit, had a nice job, I think. But that’s
what they did—did you know? Even after the Palmer raids—that was maybe
1919—they kept deporting people. They picked them up at home, at the
Russian Artists’ Club, at meetings. Of course, you weren’t even around
yet, maybe just born. They thought that these kids had in mind a big
revolution—like in Russia. Some joke. Ignorance. Grisha and his friends
didn’t like Lenin from the beginning. More Bakunin. Emma Goldman, her
boyfriend, I forgot his name.</p>
<p>Berkman.</p>
<p>Right. They were shipped, I believe, to Vladivostok. There must be a
file somewhere. Archives salted away. Why did they go after him? Maybe
they were mostly Jews. Anti-Semitism in the American blood from Europe—a
little thinner, I suppose. But why didn’t we talk? All the years not
talking. Me seeing sick people day and night. Strangers. And not talking
to my brother till all of a sudden he’s on a ship. Gone.</p>
<p>Go home now. I don’t have much more to tell you. Anyway, it’s late. I
have to prepare now all of my courage, not for sleep, for waking in the
early morning, maybe 3 or 4 a.m. I have to be ready for them, my morning
visitors—your babushka, your mama, most of all, to tell the truth, it’s
for your aunt, my sister, the youngest. She said to me, that day in the
hospital, Don’t leave me here, take me home to die. And I didn’t. And
her face looked at me that day and many, many mornings looks at me
still.</p>
<p>I stood near the door holding my coat. A space at last for me to say
something. My mouth open.</p>
<p>Enough, already, he said. I had the job to tell you how to take care
of yourself, what to expect. About the heart—you know it was not a
metaphor. But in the end a great thing, a really interesting thing,
would be to find out what happened to our Grisha. You’re smart. You can
do it. Also, you’ll see, you’ll be lucky in this life to have something
you must do to take your mind off all the things you didn’t do.</p>
<p>Then he said, I suppose that is something like a joke. But, my dear
girl, very serious.</p>
