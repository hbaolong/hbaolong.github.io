<h4 id="a-father-to-be">A Father-to-Be</h4>
<p>By Saul Bellow (1955)</p>
<p>The strangest notions had a way of forcing themselves into Rogin’s
mind. Just thirty-one and passable-looking, with short black hair, small
eyes, but a high, open forehead, he was a research chemist, and his mind
was generally serious and dependable. But on a snowy Sunday evening
while this stocky man, buttoned to the chin in a Burberry coat and
walking in his preposterous gait—feet turned outward—was going toward
the subway, he fell into a peculiar state.</p>
<p>He was on his way to have supper with his fiancée. She had phoned him
a short while ago and said, “You’d better pick up a few things on the
way.”</p>
<p>“What do we need?”</p>
<p>“Some roast beef, for one thing. I bought a quarter of a pound coming
home from my aunt’s.”</p>
<p>“Why a quarter of a pound, Joan?” said Rogin, deeply annoyed. “That’s
just about enough for one good sandwich.”</p>
<p>“So you have to stop at a delicatessen. I had no more money.”</p>
<p>He was about to ask, “What happened to the thirty dollars I gave you
on Wednesday?,” but he knew that would not be right.</p>
<p>“I had to give Phyllis money for the cleaning woman,” said Joan.</p>
<p>Phyllis, Joan’s cousin, was a young divorcée, extremely wealthy. The
two women shared an apartment.</p>
<p>“Roast beef,” he said, “and what else?”</p>
<p>“Some shampoo, sweetheart. We’ve used up all the shampoo. And hurry,
darling, I’ve missed you all day.”</p>
<p>“And I’ve missed you,” said Rogin, but to tell the truth he had been
worrying most of the time. He had a younger brother whom he was putting
through college. And his mother, whose annuity wasn’t quite enough in
these days of inflation and high taxes, needed money, too. Joan had
debts he was helping her to pay, for she wasn’t working. She was looking
for something suitable to do. Beautiful, well-educated, aristocratic in
her attitude, she couldn’t clerk in a dime store; she couldn’t model
clothes (Rogin thought this made girls vain and stiff, and he didn’t
want her to); she couldn’t be a waitress or a cashier. What could she
be? Well, something would turn up, and meantime Rogin hesitated to
complain. He paid her bills—the dentist, the department store, the
osteopath, the doctor, the psychiatrist. At Christmas, Rogin almost went
mad. Joan bought him a velvet smoking jacket with frog fasteners, a
beautiful pipe, and a pouch. She bought Phyllis a garnet brooch, an
Italian silk umbrella, and a gold cigarette holder. For other friends,
she bought Dutch pewter and Swedish glassware. Before she was through,
she had spent five hundred dollars of Rogin’s money. He loved her too
much to show his suffering. He believed she had a far better nature than
his. She didn’t worry about money. She had a marvellous character,
always cheerful, and she really didn’t need a psychiatrist at all. She
went to one because Phyllis did and it made her curious. She tried too
much to keep up with her cousin, whose father had made millions in the
rug business.</p>
<p>While the woman in the drugstore was wrapping the shampoo bottle, a
clear idea suddenly arose in Rogin’s thoughts: Money surrounds you in
life as the earth does in death. Superimposition is the universal law.
Who is free? No one is free. Who has no burdens? Everyone is under
pressure. The very rocks, the waters of the earth, beasts, men,
children—everyone has some weight to carry. This idea was extremely
clear to him at first. Soon it became rather vague, but it had a great
effect nevertheless, as if someone had given him a valuable gift. (Not
like the velvet smoking jacket he couldn’t bring himself to wear, or the
pipe it choked him to smoke.) The notion that all were under pressure
and affliction, instead of saddening him, had the opposite influence. It
put him in a wonderful mood. It was extraordinary how happy he became
and, in addition, clear-sighted. His eyes all at once were opened to
what was around him. He saw with delight how the druggist and the woman
who wrapped the shampoo bottle were smiling and flirting, how the lines
of worry in her face went over into lines of cheer and the druggist’s
receding gums did not hinder his kidding and friendliness. And in the
delicatessen, also, it was amazing how much Rogin noted and what
happiness it gave him simply to be there.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Delicatessens on Sunday night, when all other stores are shut, will
overcharge you ferociously, and Rogin would normally have been on guard,
but he was not tonight, or scarcely so. Smells of pickle, sausage,
mustard, and smoked fish overjoyed him. He pitied the people who would
buy the chicken salad and chopped herring; they could do it only because
their sight was too dim to see what they were getting—the fat flakes of
pepper on the chicken, the soppy herring, mostly vinegar-soaked stale
bread. Who would buy them? Late risers, people living alone, waking up
in the darkness of the afternoon, finding their refrigerators empty, or
people whose gaze was turned inward. The roast beef looked not bad, and
Rogin ordered a pound.</p>
<p>While the storekeeper was slicing the meat, he yelled at a Puerto
Rican kid who was reaching for a bag of chocolate cookies, “Hey, you
want to pull me down the whole display on yourself? You, chico, wait a
half a minute.” This storekeeper, though he looked like one of Pancho
Villa’s bandits, the kind that smeared their enemies with syrup and
staked them down on anthills, a man with toadlike eyes and stout hands
made to clasp pistols hung around his belly, was not so bad. He was a
New York man, thought Rogin—who was from Albany himself—a New York man
toughened by every abuse of the city, trained to suspect everyone. But
in his own realm, on the board behind the counter, there was justice.
Even clemency.</p>
<p>The Puerto Rican kid wore a complete cowboy outfit—a green hat with
white braid, guns, chaps, spurs, boots, and gauntlets—but he couldn’t
speak any English. Rogin unhooked the cellophane bag of hard circular
cookies and gave it to him. The boy tore the cellophane with his teeth
and began to chew one of those dry chocolate discs. Rogin recognized his
state—the energetic dream of childhood. Once, he, too, had found these
dry biscuits delicious. It would have bored him now to eat one.</p>
<p>What else would Joan like? Rogin thought fondly. Some strawberries?
“Give me some frozen strawberries. No, raspberries, she likes those
better. And heavy cream. And some rolls, cream cheese, and some of those
rubber-looking gherkins.”</p>
<p>“What rubber?”</p>
<p>“Those, deep green, with eyes. Some ice cream might be in order,
too.”</p>
<p>He tried to think of a compliment, a good comparison, an endearment,
for Joan when she’d open the door. What about her complexion? There was
really nothing to compare her sweet, small, daring, shapely, timid,
defiant, loving face to. How difficult she was, and how beautiful!</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>As Rogin went down into the stony, odorous, metallic, captive air of
the subway, he was diverted by an unusual confession made by a man to
his friend. These were two very tall men, shapeless in their winter
clothes, as if their coats concealed suits of chain mail.</p>
<p>“So, how long have you known me?” said one.</p>
<p>“Twelve years.”</p>
<p>“Well, I have an admission to make,” he said. “I’ve decided that I
might as well. For years I’ve been a heavy drinker. You didn’t know.
Practically an alcoholic.”</p>
<p>But his friend was not surprised, and he answered immediately, “Yes,
I did know.”</p>
<p>“You knew? Impossible! How could you?”</p>
<p>Why, thought Rogin, as if it could be a secret! Look at that long,
austere, alcohol-washed face, that drink-ruined nose, the skin by his
ears like turkey wattles, and those whiskey-saddened eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, I did know, though.”</p>
<p>“You couldn’t have. I can’t believe it.” He was upset, and his friend
didn’t seem to want to soothe him. “But it’s all right now,” he said.
“I’ve been going to a doctor and taking pills, a new revolutionary
Danish discovery. It’s a miracle. I’m beginning to believe they can cure
you of anything and everything. You can’t beat the Danes in science.
They do everything. They turned a man into a woman.”</p>
<p>“That isn’t how they stop you from drinking, is it?”</p>
<p>“No. I hope not. This is only like aspirin. It’s super-aspirin. They
call it the aspirin of the future. But if you use it, you have to stop
drinking.”</p>
<p>Rogin’s illuminated mind asked of itself while the human tides of the
subway swayed back and forth, and cars linked and transparent like fish
bladders raced under the streets: How come he thought nobody would know
what everybody couldn’t help knowing? And, as a chemist, he asked
himself what kind of compound this new Danish drug might be, and started
thinking about various inventions of his own, synthetic albumen, a
cigarette that lit itself, a cheaper motor fuel. Ye gods, but he needed
money! As never before. What was to be done? His mother was growing more
and more difficult. On Friday night, she had neglected to cut up his
meat for him, and he was hurt. She had sat at the table motionless, with
her long-suffering face, severe, and let him cut his own meat, a thing
she almost never did. She had always spoiled him and made his brother
envy him. But what she expected now! Oh, Lord, how he had to pay, and it
had never even occurred to him formerly that these things might have a
price.</p>
<p>Seated, one of the passengers, Rogin recovered his calm, happy, even
clairvoyant state of mind. To think of money was to think as the world
wanted you to think; then you’d never be your own master. When people
said they wouldn’t do something for love or money, they meant that love
and money were opposite passions and one the enemy of the other. He went
on to reflect how little people knew about this, how they slept through
life, how small a light the light of consciousness was. Rogin’s clean,
snub-nosed face shone while his heart was torn with joy at these deeper
thoughts of our ignorance. You might take this drunkard as an example,
who for long years thought his closest friends never suspected he drank.
Rogin looked up and down the aisle for this remarkable knightly symbol,
but he was gone.</p>
<p>However, there was no lack of things to see. There was a small girl
with a new white muff; into the muff a doll’s head was sewn, and the
child was happy and affectionately vain of it, while her old man, stout
and grim, with a huge scowling nose, kept picking her up and resettling
her in the seat, as if he were trying to change her into something else.
Then another child, led by her mother, boarded the car, and this other
child carried the very same doll-faced muff, and this greatly annoyed
both parents. The woman, who looked like a difficult, contentious woman,
took her daughter away. It seemed to Rogin that each child was in love
with its own muff and didn’t even see the other, but it was one of his
foibles to think he understood the hearts of little children.</p>
<p>A foreign family next engaged his attention. They looked like Central
Americans to him. On one side the mother, quite old, dark-faced,
white-haired, and worn out; on the other a son with the whitened, porous
hands of a dishwasher. But what was the dwarf who sat between them—a son
or a daughter? The hair was long and wavy and the cheeks smooth, but the
shirt and tie were masculine. The overcoat was feminine, but the
shoes—the shoes were a puzzle. A pair of brown oxfords with an outer
seam like a man’s, but Baby Louis heels like a woman’s—a plain toe like
a man’s, but a strap across the instep like a woman’s. No stockings.
That didn’t help much. The dwarf’s fingers were beringed, but without a
wedding band. There were small grim dents in the cheeks. The eyes were
puffy and concealed, but Rogin did not doubt that they could reveal
strange things if they chose and that this was a creature of remarkable
understanding. He had for many years owned De la Mare’s “Memoirs of a
Midget.” Now he took a resolve; he would read it. As soon as he had
decided, he was free from his consuming curiosity as to the dwarf’s sex
and was able to look at the person who sat beside him.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Thoughts very often grow fertile in the subway, because of the
motion, the great company, the subtlety of the rider’s state as he
rattles under streets and rivers, under the foundations of great
buildings, and Rogin’s mind had already been strangely stimulated.
Clasping the bag of groceries from which there rose odors of bread and
pickle spice, he was following a train of reflections, first about the
chemistry of sex determination, the X and Y chromosomes, hereditary
linkages, the uterus, afterward about his brother as a tax exemption. He
recalled two dreams of the night before. In one, an undertaker had
offered to cut his hair, and he had refused. In another, he had been
carrying a woman on his head. Sad dreams, both! Very sad! Which was the
woman—Joan or Mother? And the undertaker—his lawyer? He gave a deep
sigh, and by force of habit began to put together his synthetic albumen
that was to revolutionize the entire egg industry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he had not interrupted his examination of the passengers
and had fallen into a study of the man next to him. This was a man whom
he had never in his life seen before but with whom he now suddenly felt
linked through all existence. He was middle-aged, sturdy, with clear
skin and blue eyes. His hands were clean, well-formed, but Rogin did not
approve of them. The coat he wore was a fairly expensive blue check such
as Rogin would never have chosen for himself. He would not have worn
blue suède shoes, either, or such a faultless hat, a cumbersome felt
animal of a hat encircled by a high, fat ribbon. There are all kinds of
dandies, not all of them are of the flaunting kind; some are dandies of
respectability, and Rogin’s fellow-passenger was one of these. His
straight-nosed profile was handsome, yet he had betrayed his gift, for
he was flat-looking. But in his flat way he seemed to warn people that
he wanted no difficulties with them, he wanted nothing to do with them.
Wearing such blue suède shoes, he could not afford to have people
treading on his feet, and he seemed to draw about himself a circle of
privilege, notifying all others to mind their own business and let him
read his paper. He was holding a Tribune, and perhaps it would be
overstatement to say that he was reading. He was holding it.</p>
<p>His clear skin and blue eyes, his straight and purely Roman nose—even
the way he sat—all strongly suggested one person to Rogin: Joan. He
tried to escape the comparison, but it couldn’t be helped. This man not
only looked like Joan’s father, whom Rogin detested; he looked like Joan
herself. Forty years hence, a son of hers, provided she had one, might
be like this. A son of hers? Of such a son, he himself, Rogin, would be
the father. Lacking in dominant traits as compared with Joan, his
heritage would not appear. Probably the children would resemble her.
Yes, think forty years ahead, and a man like this, who sat by him knee
to knee in the hurtling car among their fellow-creatures, unconscious
participants in a sort of great carnival of transit—such a man would
carry forward what had been Rogin.</p>
<p>This was why he felt bound to him through all existence. What were
forty years reckoned against eternity! Forty years were gone, and he was
gazing at his own son. Here he was. Rogin was frightened and moved. “My
son! My son!” he said to himself, and the pity of it almost made him
burst into tears. The holy and frightful work of the masters of life and
death brought this about. We were their instruments. We worked toward
ends we thought were our own. But no! The whole thing was so unjust. To
suffer, to labor, to toil and force your way through the spikes of life,
to crawl through its darkest caverns, to push through the worst, to
struggle under the weight of economy, to make money—only to become the
father of a fourth-rate man of the world like this, so flat-looking,
with his ordinary, clean, rosy, uninteresting, self-satisfied,
fundamentally bourgeois face. What a curse to have a dull son! A son
like this, who could never understand his father. They had absolutely
nothing, but nothing in common, he and this neat, chubby, blue-eyed man.
He was so pleased, thought Rogin, with all he owned and all he did and
all he was that he could hardly unfasten his lip. Look at that lip,
sticking up at the tip like a little thorn or egg tooth. He wouldn’t
give anyone the time of day. Would this perhaps be general forty years
from now? Would personalities be chillier as the world aged and grew
colder? The inhumanity of the next generation incensed Rogin. Father and
son had no sign to make to each other. Terrible! Inhuman! What a vision
of existence it gave him. Man’s personal aims were nothing, illusion.
The life force occupied each of us in turn in its progress toward its
own fulfillment, trampling on our individual humanity, using us for its
own ends like mere dinosaurs or bees, exploiting love heartlessly,
making us engage in the social process, labor, struggle for money, and
submit to the law of pressure, the universal law of layers,
superimposition!</p>
<p>What the blazes am I getting into? Rogin thought. To be the father of
a throwback to her father. The image of this white-haired, gross,
peevish old man with his ugly selfish blue eyes revolted Rogin. This was
how his grandson would look. Joan, with whom Rogin was now more and more
displeased, could not help that. For her, it was inevitable. But did it
have to be inevitable for him? Well, then, Rogin, you fool, don’t be a
damned instrument. Get out of the way!</p>
<p>But it was too late for this, because he had already experienced the
sensation of sitting next to his own son, his son and Joan’s. He kept
staring at him, waiting for him to say something, but the presumptive
son remained coldly silent though he must have been aware of Rogin’s
scrutiny. They even got out at the same stop—Sheridan Square. When they
stepped to the platform, the man, without even looking at Rogin, went
away in a different direction in his detestable blue-checked coat, with
his rosy, nasty face.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The whole thing upset Rogin very badly. When he approached Joan’s
door and heard Phyllis’s little dog Henri barking even before he could
knock, his face was very tense. “I won’t be used,” he declared to
himself. “I have my own right to exist.” Joan had better watch out. She
had a light way of bypassing grave questions he had given earnest
thought to. She always assumed no really disturbing thing would happen.
He could not afford the luxury of such a carefree, debonair attitude
himself, because he had to work hard and earn money so that disturbing
things would not happen. Well, at the moment this situation could not be
helped, and he really did not mind the money if he could feel that she
was not necessarily the mother of such a son as his subway son or
entirely the daughter of that awful, obscene father of hers. After all,
Rogin was not himself so much like either of his parents, and quite
different from his brother.</p>
<p>Joan came to the door, wearing one of Phyllis’s expensive housecoats.
It suited her very well. At first sight of her happy face, Rogin was
brushed by the shadow of resemblance; the touch of it was extremely
light, almost figmentary, but it made his flesh tremble.</p>
<p>She began to kiss him, saying, “Oh, my baby. You’re covered with
snow. Why didn’t you wear your hat? It’s all over its little head”—her
favorite third-person endearment.</p>
<p>“Well, let me put down this bag of stuff. Let me take off my coat,”
grumbled Rogin, and escaped from her embrace. Why couldn’t she wait
making up to him? “It’s so hot in here. My face is burning. Why do you
keep the place at this temperature? And that damned dog keeps barking.
If you didn’t keep it cooped up, it wouldn’t be so spoiled and noisy.
Why doesn’t anybody ever walk him?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s not really so hot here! You’ve just come in from the cold.
Don’t you think this housecoat fits me better than Phyllis? Especially
across the hips. She thinks so, too. She may sell it to me.”</p>
<p>“I hope not,” Rogin almost exclaimed.</p>
<p>She brought a towel to dry the melting snow from his short, black
hair. The flurry of rubbing excited Henri intolerably, and Joan locked
him up in the bedroom, where he jumped persistently against the door
with a rhythmic sound of claws on the wood.</p>
<p>Joan said, “Did you bring the shampoo?”</p>
<p>“Here it is.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll wash your hair before dinner. Come.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want it washed.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on,” she said, laughing.</p>
<p>Her lack of consciousness of guilt amazed him. He did not see how it
could be. And the carpeted, furnished, lamplit, curtained room seemed to
stand against his vision. So that he felt accusing and angry, his spirit
sore and bitter, but it did not seem fitting to say why. Indeed, he
began to worry lest the reason for it all slip away from him.</p>
<p>They took off his coat and his shirt in the bathroom, and she filled
the sink. Rogin was full of his troubled emotions; now that his chest
was bare, he could feel them even more distinctly inside, and he said to
himself, “I’ll have a thing or two to tell her pretty soon. I’m not
letting them get away with it. ‘Do you think,’ he was going to tell her,
‘that I alone was made to carry the burden of the whole world on me? Do
you think I was born just to be taken advantage of and sacrificed? Do
you think I’m just a natural resource, like a coal mine, or oil well, or
fishery, or the like? Remember, that I’m a man is no reason why I should
be loaded down. I have a soul in me no bigger or stronger than yours.
Take away the externals, like the muscles, deeper voice, and so forth,
and what remains? A pair of spirits, practically alike. So why shouldn’t
there also be equality? I can’t always be the strong one.’ ”</p>
<p>“Sit here,” said Joan, bringing up a kitchen stool to the sink. “Your
hair’s gotten all matted.”</p>
<p>He sat with his breast against the cool enamel, his chin on the edge
of the basin, the green, hot, radiant water reflecting the glass and the
tile, and the sweet, cool, fragrant juice of the shampoo poured on his
head. She began to wash him.</p>
<p>“You have the healthiest-looking scalp,” she said. “It’s all
pink.”</p>
<p>He answered, “Well, it should be white. There must be something wrong
with me.”</p>
<p>“But there’s absolutely nothing wrong with you,” she said, and
pressed against him from behind, surrounding him, pouring the water
gently over him until it seemed to him that the water came from within
him, it was the warm fluid of his own secret loving spirit overflowing
into the sink, green and foaming, and the words he had rehearsed he
forgot, and his anger at his son-to-be disappeared altogether, and he
sighed, and said to her from the water-filled hollow of the sink, “You
always have such wonderful ideas, Joan. You know? You have a kind of
instinct, a regular gift.”</p>
