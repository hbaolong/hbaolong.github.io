<h4 id="the-five-forty-eight">The Five-Forty-Eight</h4>
<p>By John Cheever (1954)</p>
<p>When Blake stepped out of the elevator, he saw her. A few people,
mostly men waiting for girls, stood in the lobby watching the elevator
doors. She was among them. As he saw her, her face took on a look of
such loathing and purpose that he realized she had been waiting for him.
He did not approach her. She had no legitimate business with him. They
had nothing to say. He turned and walked toward the glass doors at the
end of the lobby, feeling that faint guilt and bewilderment we
experience when we bypass some old friend or classmate who seems
threadbare, or sick, or miserable in some other way. It was
five-eighteen by the clock in the Western Union office. He could catch
the express. As he waited his turn at the revolving doors, he saw that
it was still raining. It had been raining all day, and he noticed now
how much louder the rain made the noises of the street. Outside, he
started walking briskly east toward Madison Avenue. Traffic was tied up,
and horns were blowing urgently on a crosstown street in the distance.
The sidewalk was crowded. He wondered what she had hoped to gain by a
glimpse of him coming out of the office building at the end of the day.
Then he wondered if she was following him.</p>
<p>Walking in the city, we seldom turn and look back. The habit
restrained Blake. He listened for a minute—foolishly—as he walked, as if
he could distinguish her footsteps from the worlds of sound in the city
at the end of a rainy day. Then he noticed, ahead of him on the other
side of the street, a break in the wall of buildings. Something had been
torn down; something was being put up, but the steel structure had only
just risen above the sidewalk fence and daylight poured through the gap.
Blake stopped opposite here and looked into a store window. It was a
decorator’s or an auctioneer’s. The window was arranged like a room in
which people live and entertain their friends. There were cups on the
coffee table, magazines to read, and flowers in the vases, but the
flowers were dead and the cups were empty and the guests had not come.
In the plate glass, Blake saw a clear reflection of himself and the
crowds that were passing, like shadows, at his back. Then he saw her
image—so close to him that it shocked him. She was standing only a foot
or two behind him. He could have turned then and asked her what she
wanted, but instead of recognizing her, he shied away abruptly from the
reflection of her contorted face and went along the street. She might be
meaning to do him harm—she might be meaning to kill him.</p>
<p>The suddenness with which he moved when he saw the reflection of her
face tipped the water out of his hatbrim in such a way that some of it
ran down his neck. It felt unpleasantly like the sweat of fear. Then the
cold water falling into his face and onto his bare hands, the rancid
smell of the wet gutters and pavings, the knowledge that his feet were
beginning to get wet and that he might catch cold—all the common
discomforts of walking in the rain—seemed to heighten the menace of his
pursuer and to give him a morbid consciousness of his own physicalness
and of the ease with which he could be hurt. He could see ahead of him
the corner of Madison Avenue, where the lights were brighter. He felt
that if he could get to Madison Avenue he would be all right. At the
corner, there was a bakery shop with two entrances, and he went in by
the door on the crosstown street, bought a coffee ring, like any other
commuter, and went out the Madison Avenue door. As he started down
Madison Avenue, he saw her waiting for him by a hut where newspapers
were sold.</p>
<p>She was not clever. She would be easy to shake. He could get into a
taxi by one door and leave by the other. He could speak to a policeman.
He could run—although he was afraid that if he did run, it might
precipitate the violence he now felt sure she had planned. He was
approaching a part of the city that he knew well and where the maze of
street-level and underground passages, elevator banks, and crowded
lobbies made it easy for a man to lose a pursuer. The thought of this,
and a whiff of sugary warmth from the coffee ring, cheered him. It was
absurd to imagine being harmed on a crowded street. She was foolish,
misled, lonely perhaps—that was all it could amount to. He was an
insignificant man, and there was no point in anyone’s following him from
his office to the station. He knew no secrets of any consequence. The
reports in his briefcase had no bearing on war, peace, the dope traffic,
the hydrogen bomb, or any of the other international skulduggeries that
he associated with pursuers, men in trench coats, and wet sidewalks.
Then he saw ahead of him the door of a men’s bar. Oh, it was so
simple!</p>
<p>He ordered a Gibson and shouldered his way in between two other men
at the bar, so that if she should be watching from the window she would
lose sight of him. The place was crowded with commuters putting down a
drink before the ride home. They had brought in on their clothes—on
their shoes and umbrellas—the rancid smell of the wet dusk outside, but
Blake began to relax as soon as he tasted his Gibson and looked around
at the common, mostly not-young faces that surrounded him and that were
worried, if they were worried at all, about tax rates and who would be
put in charge of merchandising. He tried to remember her name—Miss Dent,
Miss Bent, Miss Lent—and he was surprised to find that he could not
remember it, although he was proud of the retentiveness and reach of his
memory and it had only been six months ago.</p>
<p>Personnel had sent her up one afternoon—he was looking for a
secretary. He saw a dark woman—in her twenties, perhaps—who was slender
and shy. Her dress was simple, her figure was not much, one of her
stockings was crooked, but her voice was soft and he had been willing to
try her out. After she had been working for him a few days, she told him
that she had been in the hospital for eight months and that it had been
hard after this for her to find work, and she wanted to thank him for
giving her a chance. Her hair was dark, her eyes were dark; she left
with him a pleasant impression of darkness. As he got to know her
better, he felt that she was oversensitive and, as a consequence,
lonely. Once, when she was speaking to him of what she imagined his life
to be—full of friendships, money, and a large and loving family—he had
thought he recognized a peculiar feeling of deprivation. She seemed to
imagine the lives of the rest of the world to be more brilliant than
they were. Once, she had put a rose on his desk, and he had dropped it
into the wastebasket. “I don’t like roses,” he told her.</p>
<p>She had been competent, punctual, and a good typist, and he had found
only one thing in her that he could object to—her handwriting. He could
not associate the crudeness of her handwriting with her appearance. He
would have expected her to write a rounded backhand, and in her writing
there were intermittent traces of this, mixed with clumsy printing. Her
writing gave him the feeling that she had been the victim of some
inner—some emotional—conflict that had in its violence broken the
continuity of the lines she was able to make on paper. When she had been
working for him three weeks—no longer—they stayed late one night and he
offered, after work, to buy her a drink. “If you really want a drink,”
she said, “I have some whiskey at my place.”</p>
<p>She lived in a room that seemed to him like a closet. There were suit
boxes and hatboxes piled in a corner, and although the room seemed
hardly big enough to hold the bed, the dresser, and the chair he sat in,
there was an upright piano against one wall, with a book of Beethoven
sonatas on the rack. She gave him a drink and said that she was going to
put on something more comfortable. He urged her to; that was, after all,
what he had come for. If he had had any qualms, they would have been
practical. Her diffidence, the feeling of deprivation in her point of
view, promised to protect him from any consequences. Most of the many
women he had known had been picked for their lack of self-esteem.</p>
<p>When he put on his clothes again, an hour or so later, she was
weeping. He felt too contented and warm and sleepy to worry much about
her tears. As he was dressing, he noticed on the dresser a note she had
written to a cleaning woman. The only light came from the bathroom—the
door was ajar—and in this half light the hideously scrawled letters
again seemed entirely wrong for her, and as if they must be the
handwriting of some other and very gross woman. The next day, he did
what he felt was the only sensible thing. When she was out for lunch, he
called personnel and asked them to fire her. Then he took the afternoon
off. A few days later, she came to the office, asking to see him. He
told the switchboard girl not to let her in. He had not seen her again
until this evening.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Blake drank a second Gibson and saw by the clock that he had missed
the express. He would get the local—the five-forty-eight. When he left
the bar the sky was still light; it was still raining. He looked
carefully up and down the street and saw that the poor woman had gone.
Once or twice, he looked over his shoulder, walking to the station, but
he seemed to be safe. He was still not quite himself, he realized,
because he had left his coffee ring at the bar, and he was not a man who
forgot things. This lapse of memory pained him.</p>
<p>He bought a paper. The local was only half full when he boarded it,
and he got a seat on the river side and took off his raincoat. He was a
slender man with brown hair—undistinguished in every way, unless you
could have divined in his pallor or his gray eyes his unpleasant tastes.
He dressed—like the rest of us—as if he admitted the existence of
sumptuary laws. His raincoat was the pale, buff color of a mushroom. His
hat was dark brown; so was his suit. Except for the few bright threads
in his necktie, there was a scrupulous lack of color in his clothing
that seemed protective.</p>
<p>He looked around the car for neighbors. Mrs. Compton was several
seats in front of him, to the right. She smiled, but her smile was
fleeting. It died swiftly and horribly. Mr. Watkins was directly in
front of Blake. Mr. Watkins needed a haircut, and he had broken the
sumptuary laws; he was wearing a corduroy jacket. He and Blake had
quarrelled, so they did not speak.</p>
<p>The swift death of Mrs. Compton’s smile did not affect Blake at all.
The Comptons lived in the house next to the Blakes, and Mrs. Compton had
never understood the importance of minding her own business. Louise
Blake took her troubles to Mrs. Compton, Blake knew, and instead of
discouraging her crying jags, Mrs. Compton had come to imagine herself a
sort of confessor and had developed a lively curiosity about the Blakes’
intimate affairs. She had probably been given an account of their most
recent quarrel. Blake had come home one night, overworked and tired, and
had found that Louise had done nothing about getting supper. The gin
bottle was half emptied, and the first three glasses he took from the
bar were smeared with lipstick grease. He had gone into the kitchen,
followed by Louise, and he had pointed out to her that the date was the
fifth. He had drawn a circle around the date on the kitchen calendar.
“One week is the twelfth,” he had said. “Two weeks will be the
nineteenth.” He drew a circle around the nineteenth. “I’m not going to
speak to you for two weeks,” he had said. “That will be the nineteenth.”
She had wept, she had protested, but it had been eight or ten years
since she had been able to touch him with her entreaties. Louise had got
old. Now the lines in her face were ineradicable, and when she clapped
her glasses onto her nose to read the evening paper she looked to him
like an unpleasant stranger. The physical charms that had been her only
attraction were gone. It had been nine years since Blake had built a
bookshelf in the doorway that connected their rooms and had fitted into
the bookshelf wooden doors that could be locked, since he did not want
the children to see his books. But their prolonged estrangement didn’t
seem remarkable to Blake. He had quarrelled with his wife, but so did
every other man born of woman. It was human nature. In any place where
you can hear their voices—a hotel courtyard, an air shaft, a street on a
summer evening—you will hear harsh words.</p>
<p>The hard feeling between Blake and Mr. Watkins also had to do with
Blake’s family, but it was not as serious or as troublesome as what lay
behind Mrs. Compton’s fleeting smile. The Watkinses rented. Mr. Watkins
broke the sumptuary laws day after day—he once went to the
eight-fourteen in a pair of sandals—and he made his living as a
commercial artist. Blake’s oldest son—Charlie was fourteen—had made
friends with the Watkins boy. He had spent a lot of time in the sloppy
rented house where the Watkinses lived. The friendship had affected his
manners and his neatness. Then he had begun to take some meals with the
Watkinses, and to spend Saturday nights there. When he had moved most of
his possessions over to the Watkinses’ and had begun to spend more than
half his nights there, Blake had been forced to act. He had spoken not
to Charlie but to Mr. Watkins, and had, of necessity, said a number of
things that must have sounded critical. Mr. Watkins’ long and dirty hair
and his corduroy jacket reassured Blake that he had been in the
right.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Compton’s dying smile and Mr. Watkins’ dirty hair did not
lessen the pleasure Blake took in settling himself in an uncomfortable
seat on the five-forty-eight deep underground. The coach was old and
smelled oddly like a bomb shelter in which whole families had spent the
night. The light that spread from the ceiling down onto their heads and
shoulders was dim. The filth on the window glass was streaked with rain
from some other journey, and clouds of rank pipe and cigarette smoke had
begun to rise from behind each newspaper, but it was a scene that meant
to Blake that he was on a safe path, and after his brush with danger he
even felt a little warmth toward Mrs. Compton and Mr. Watkins.</p>
<p>The train travelled up from underground into the weak daylight, and
the slums and the city reminded Blake vaguely of the woman who had
followed him. To avoid speculation or remorse about her, he turned his
attention to the evening paper. Out of the corner of his eye he could
see the landscape. It was industrial and, at that hour, sad. There were
machine sheds and warehouses, and above these he saw a break in the
clouds—a piece of yellow light. “Mr. Blake,” someone said. He looked up.
It was she. She was standing there holding one hand on the back of the
seat to steady herself in the swaying coach. He remembered her name
then—Miss Dent. “Hello, Miss Dent,” he said.</p>
<p>“Do you mind if I sit here?”</p>
<p>“I guess not.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. It’s very kind of you. I don’t like to inconvenience you
like this. I don’t want to…” He had been frightened when he looked up
and saw her, but her timid voice rapidly reassured him. He shifted his
hams—that futile and reflexive gesture of hospitality—and she sat down.
She sighed. He smelled her wet clothing. She wore a formless black hat
with a cheap crest stitched onto it. Her coat was thin cloth, he saw,
and she wore gloves and carried a large pocketbook.</p>
<p>“Are you living out in this direction now, Miss Dent?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>She opened her purse and reached for her handkerchief. She had begun
to cry. He turned his head to see if anyone in the car was looking, but
no one was. He had sat beside a thousand passengers on the evening
train. He had noticed their clothes, the holes in their gloves; and if
they fell asleep and mumbled he had wondered what their worries were. He
had classified almost all of them briefly before he buried his nose in
the paper. He had marked them as rich, poor, brilliant or dull,
neighbors or strangers, but no one of the thousands had ever wept. When
she opened her purse, he remembered her perfume. It had clung to his
skin the night he went to her place for a drink.</p>
<p>“I’ve been very sick,” she said. “This is the first time I’ve been
out of bed in two weeks. I’ve been terribly sick.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry that you’ve been sick, Miss Dent,” he said in a voice loud
enough to be heard by Mr. Watkins and Mrs. Compton. “Where are you
working now?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Where are you working now?”</p>
<p>“Oh don’t make me laugh,” she said softly.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“You poisoned their minds.”</p>
<p>He straightened his back and braced his shoulders. These wrenching
movements expressed a brief—and hopeless—longing to be in some other
place. She meant trouble. He took a breath. He looked with deep feeling
at the half-filled, half-lighted coach to affirm his sense of actuality,
of a world in which there was not very much bad trouble after all. He
was conscious of her heavy breathing and the smell of her rain-soaked
coat. The train stopped. A nun and a man in overalls got off. When it
started again, Blake put on his hat and reached for his raincoat.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” she said.</p>
<p>“I’m going up to the next car.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” she said. “No, no, no.” She put her white face so close to
his ear that he could feel her warm breath on his cheek. “Don’t do
that,” she whispered. “Don’t try and escape me. I have a pistol and I’ll
have to kill you and I don’t want to. All I want to do is to talk with
you. Don’t move or I’ll kill you. Don’t, don’t, don’t!”</p>
<p>Blake sat back abruptly in his seat. If he had wanted to stand and
shout for help, he would not have been able to. His tongue had swelled
to twice its size, and when he tried to move it, it stuck horribly to
the roof of his mouth. His legs were limp. All he could think of to do
then was to wait for his heart to stop its hysterical beating, so that
he could judge the extent of his danger. She was sitting a little
sidewise, and in her pocketbook was the pistol, aimed at his belly.</p>
<p>“You understand me now, don’t you?” she said. “You understand that
I’m serious?” He tried to speak but he was still mute. He nodded his
head. “Now we’ll sit quietly for a little while,” she said. “I got so
excited that my thoughts are all confused. We’ll sit quietly for a
little while, until I can get my thoughts in order again.”</p>
<p>Help would come, Blake thought. It was only a question of minutes.
Someone, noticing the look on his face or her peculiar posture, would
stop and interfere, and it would all be over. All he had to do was to
wait until someone noticed his predicament. Out of the window he saw the
river and the sky. The rain clouds were rolling down like a shutter, and
while he watched, a streak of orange light on the horizon became
brilliant. Its brilliance spread—he could see it move—across the waves
until it raked the banks of the river with a dim firelight. Then it was
put out. Help would come in a minute, he thought. Help would come before
they stopped again; but the train stopped, there were some comings and
goings, and Blake still lived on, at the mercy of the woman beside him.
The possibility that help might not come was one that he could not face.
The possibility that his predicament was not noticeable, that
Mrs. Compton would guess that he was taking a poor relation out to
dinner at Shady Hill, was something he would think about later. Then the
saliva came back into his mouth and he was able to speak.</p>
<p>“Miss Dent?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>“I want to talk with you.”</p>
<p>“You can come to my office.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no. I went there every day for two weeks.”</p>
<p>“You could make an appointment.”</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “I think we can talk here. I wrote you a letter but
I’ve been too sick to go out and mail it. I’ve put down all my thoughts.
I like to travel. I like trains. One of my troubles has always been that
I could never afford to travel. I suppose you see this scenery every
night and don’t notice it any more, but it’s nice for someone who’s been
in bed a long time. They say that He’s not in the river and the hills
but I think He is. ‘Where shall wisdom be found,’ it says. ‘Where is the
place of understanding? The depth saith it is not in me; the sea saith
it is not with me. Destruction and death say we have heard the force
with our ears.’</p>
<p>“Oh, I know what you’re thinking,” she said. “You’re thinking that
I’m crazy, and I have been very sick again but I’m going to be better.
It’s going to make me better to talk with you. I was in the hospital all
the time before I came to work for you but they never tried to cure me,
they only wanted to take away my self-respect. I haven’t had any work
now for three months. Even if I did have to kill you, they wouldn’t be
able to do anything to me except put me back in the hospital, so you see
I’m not afraid. But let’s sit quietly for a little while longer. I have
to be calm.”</p>
<p>The train continued its halting progress up the bank of the river,
and Blake tried to force himself to make some plans for escape, but the
immediate threat to his life made this difficult, and instead of
planning sensibly, he thought of the many ways in which he could have
avoided her in the first place. As soon as he had felt these regrets, he
realized their futility. It was like regretting his lack of suspicion
when she first mentioned her months in the hospital. It was like
regretting his failure to have been warned by her shyness, her
diffidence, and the handwriting that looked like the marks of a claw.
There was no way now of rectifying his mistakes, and he felt—for perhaps
the first time in his mature life—the full force of regret. Out of the
window, he saw some men fishing on the nearly dark river, and then a
ramshackle boat club that seemed to have been nailed together out of
scraps of wood that had been washed up on the shore.</p>
<p>Mr. Watkins had fallen asleep. He was snoring. Mrs. Compton read her
paper. The train creaked, slowed, and halted infirmly at another
station. Blake could see the southbound platform, where a few passengers
were waiting to go into the city. There was a workman with a lunch pail,
a dressed-up woman, and a man with a suitcase. They stood apart from one
another. Some advertisements were posted on the wall behind them. There
was a picture of a couple drinking a toast in wine, a picture of a Cat’s
Paw rubber heel, and a picture of a Hawaiian dancer. Their cheerful
intent seemed to go no farther than the puddles of water on the platform
and to expire there. The platform and the people on it looked lonely.
The train drew away from the station into the scattered lights of a slum
and then into the darkness of the country and the river.</p>
<p>“I want you to read my letter before we get to Shady Hill,” she said.
“It’s on the seat. Pick it up. I would have mailed it to you, but I’ve
been too sick to go out. I haven’t gone out for two weeks. I haven’t had
any work for three months. I haven’t spoken to anybody but the landlady.
Please read my letter.”</p>
<p>He picked up the letter from the seat where she had put it. The cheap
paper felt abhorrent and filthy to his fingers. It was folded and
refolded. “Dear Husband,” she had written, in that crazy, wandering
hand, “they say that human love leads us to divine love, but is this
true? I dream about you every night. I have such terrible desires. I
have always had a gift for dreams. I dreamed on Tuesday of a volcano
erupting with blood. When I was in the hospital they said they wanted to
cure me but they only wanted to take away my self-respect. They only
wanted me to dream about sewing and basketwork but I protected my gift
for dreams. I’m clairvoyant. I can tell when the telephone is going to
ring. I’ve never had a true friend in my whole life….”</p>
<p>The train stopped again. There was another platform, another picture
of the couple drinking a toast, the rubber heel, and the Hawaiian
dancer. Suddenly she pressed her face close to Blake’s again and
whispered in his ear. “I know what you’re thinking. I can see it in your
face. You’re thinking you can get away from me in Shady Hill, aren’t
you? Oh, I’ve been planning this for weeks. It’s all I’ve had to think
about. I won’t harm you if you’ll let me talk. I’ve been thinking about
devils. I mean if there are devils in the world, if there are people in
the world who represent evil, is it our duty to exterminate them? I know
that you always prey on weak people. I can tell. Oh, sometimes I think
that I ought to kill you. Sometimes I think you’re the only obstacle
between me and my happiness. Sometimes…”</p>
<p>She touched Blake with the pistol. He felt the muzzle against his
belly. The bullet, at that distance, would make a small hole where it
entered, but it would rip out of his back a place as big as a soccer
ball. He remembered the unburied dead he had seen in the war. The memory
came in a rush: entrails, yes, shattered bone, ordure, and other
filth.</p>
<p>“All I’ve ever wanted in life is a little love,” she said. She
lightened the pressure of the gun. Mr. Watkins still slept. Mrs. Compton
was sitting calmly with her hands folded in her lap. The coach rocked
gently, and the coats and mushroom-colored raincoats that hung between
the windows swayed a little as the car moved. Blake’s elbow was on the
window sill and his left shoe was on the guard above the steampipe. The
car smelled like some dismal classroom. The passengers seemed asleep and
apart, and Blake felt that he might never escape the smell of heat and
wet clothing and the dimness of the light. He tried to summon the
calculated self-deceptions with which he sometimes cheered himself, but
he was left without any energy for hope or self-deception.</p>
<p>The conductor put his head in the door and said “Shady Hill, next,
Shady Hill.”</p>
<p>“Now,” she said. “Now you get out ahead of me.”</p>
<p>Mr. Watkins waked suddenly, put on his coat and hat, and smiled at
Mrs. Compton, who was gathering her parcels to her in a series of
maternal gestures. They went to the door. Blake joined them, but neither
of them spoke to him or seemed to notice the woman at his back. The
conductor threw open the door, and Blake saw on the platform of the next
car a few other neighbors who had missed the express, waiting patiently
and tiredly in the wan light for their trip to end. He raised his head
to see through the open door the abandoned mansion outside of town, a
no-trespassing sign nailed to a tree, and then the oil tanks. The
concrete abutments of the bridge passed, so close to the open door that
he could have touched them. Then he saw the first of the lampposts on
the northbound platform, the sign “Shady Hill” in black and gold, and
the little lawn and flower bed kept up by the Improvement Association,
and then the cab stand and a corner of the old-fashioned depot. It was
raining again; it was pouring. He could hear the splash of water and see
the lights reflected in puddles and in the shining pavement, and the
idle sound of splashing and dripping formed in his mind a conception of
shelter, so light and strange that it seemed to belong to a time of his
life that he could not remember.</p>
<p>He went down the steps with her at his back. A dozen or so cars were
waiting by the station with their motors running. A few people got off
from each of the other coaches; he recognized most of them, but none of
them offered to give him a ride. They walked separately or in
pairs—purposefully out of the rain to the shelter of the platform, where
the car horns called to them. It was time to go home, time for a drink,
time for love, time for supper, and he could see the lights on the
hill—lights by which children were being bathed, meat cooked, dishes
washed—shining in the rain. One by one, the cars picked up the heads of
families, until there were only four left. Two of the stranded
passengers drove off in the only taxi the village had. “I’m sorry,
darling,” a woman said tenderly to her husband when she drove up a few
minutes later. “All our clocks are slow.” The last man looked at his
watch, looked at the rain, and then walked off into it, and Blake saw
him go as if they had some reason to say goodbye—not as we say goodbye
to friends after a party but as we say goodbye when we are faced with an
inexorable and unwanted parting of the spirit and the heart. The man’s
footsteps sounded as he crossed the parking lot to the sidewalk, and
then they were lost. In the station, a telephone began to ring. The
ringing was loud, plaintive, evenly spaced, and unanswered. Someone
wanted to know about the next train to Albany, but Mr. Flannagan, the
stationmaster, had gone home an hour ago. He had turned on all his
lights before he went away. They burned in the empty waiting room. They
burned, tin-shaded, at intervals up and down the platform. and with the
peculiar sadness of dim and purposeless light. They lighted the Hawaiian
dancer, the couple drinking a toast, the rubber heel.</p>
<p>“I’ve never been here before,” she said. “I thought it would look
different. I didn’t think it would look so shabby. Let’s get out of the
light. Go over there.”</p>
<p>His legs felt sore. All his strength was gone. “Go on,” she said.</p>
<p>North of the station there was a freight house and a coalyard and an
inlet where the butcher and the baker and the man who ran the service
station moored the dinghies from which they fished on Sundays, sunk now
to the gunwales with the rain. As he walked toward the freight house, he
saw a movement on the ground and heard a scraping sound, and then he saw
a rat take its head out of a paper bag and regard him. The rat seized
the bag in its teeth and dragged it into a culvert.</p>
<p>“Stop,” she said. “Turn around. Oh, I ought to feel sorry for you.
Look at your poor face. But you don’t know what I’ve been through. I’m
afraid to go out in the daylight. I’m afraid the blue sky will fall down
on me. I’m like poor Chicken-Licken. I only feel like myself when it
begins to get dark. But still and all I’m better than you. I still have
good dreams sometimes. I dream about picnics and Heaven and the
brotherhood of man, and about castles in the moonlight and a river with
willow trees all along the edge of it and foreign cities, and after all
I know more about love than you.”</p>
<p>He heard from off the dark river the drone of an outboard motor, a
sound that drew slowly behind it across the dark water such a burden of
clear, sweet memories of gone summers and gone pleasures that it made
his flesh crawl, and he thought of dark in the mountains and the
children singing. “They never wanted to cure me,” she said. “They…” The
noise of a train coming down from the north drowned out her voice, but
she went on talking. The noise filled his ears, and the windows where
people ate, drank, slept, and read flew past. When the train had passed
beyond the bridge, the noise grew distant, and he heard her screaming at
him, “Kneel down! Kneel down! Do what I say. Kneel down!”</p>
<p>He got to his knees. He bent his head. “There,” she said. “You see,
if you do what I say, I won’t harm you, because I really don’t want to
harm you, I want to help you, but when I see your face it sometimes
seems to me that I can’t help you. Sometimes it seems to me that if I
were good and loving and sane—oh, much better than I am—sometimes it
seems to me that if I were all these things and young and beautiful,
too, and if I called to show you the right way, you wouldn’t heed me.
Oh, I’m better than you, I’m better than you, and I shouldn’t waste my
time or spoil my life like this. Put your face in the dirt. Put your
face in the dirt! Do what I say. Put your face in the dirt.”</p>
<p>He fell forward in the filth. The coal skinned his face. He stretched
out on the ground, weeping. “Now I feel better,” she said. “Now I can
wash my hands of you, I can wash my hands of all this, because you see
there is some kindness, some saneness in me that I can find again and
use. I can wash my hands.” Then he heard her footsteps go away from him,
over the rubble. He heard the clearer and more distant sound they made
on the hard surface of the platform. He heard them diminish. He raised
his head. He saw her climb the stairs of the wooden footbridge and cross
it and go down to the other platform, where her figure in the dim light
looked small, common, and harmless. He raised himself out of the
dust—warily at first, until he saw by her attitude, her looks, that she
had forgotten him; that she had completed what she had wanted to do, and
that he was safe. He got to his feet and picked up his hat from the
ground where it had fallen and walked home.</p>
