<h4 id="going-for-a-beer">Going for a Beer</h4>
<p>By Robert Coover (2011)</p>
<p>He finds himself sitting in the neighborhood bar drinking a beer at
about the same time that he began to think about going there for one. In
fact, he has finished it. Perhaps he’ll have a second one, he thinks, as
he downs it and asks for a third. There is a young woman sitting not far
from him who is not exactly good-looking but good-looking enough, and
probably good in bed, as indeed she is. Did he finish his beer? Can’t
remember. What really matters is: Did he enjoy his orgasm? Or even have
one? This he is wondering on his way home through the foggy night
streets from the young woman’s apartment. Which was full of Kewpie
dolls, the sort won at carnivals, and they made a date, as he recalls,
to go to one. Where she wins another—she has a knack for it. Whereupon
they’re in her apartment again, taking their clothes off, she excitedly
cuddling her new doll in a bed heaped with them. He can’t remember when
he last slept, and he’s no longer sure, as he staggers through the night
streets, still foggy, where his own apartment is, his orgasm, if he had
one, already fading from memory. Maybe he should take her back to the
carnival, he thinks, where she wins another Kewpie doll (this is at
least their second date, maybe their fourth), and this time they go for
a romantic nightcap at the bar where they first met. Where a brawny dude
starts hassling her. He intervenes and she turns up at his hospital bed,
bringing him one of her Kewpie dolls to keep him company. Which is her
way of expressing the bond between them, or so he supposes, as he leaves
the hospital on crutches, uncertain what part of town he is in. Or what
part of the year. He decides that it’s time to call the affair off—she’s
driving him crazy—but then the brawny dude turns up at their wedding and
apologizes for the pounding he gave him. He didn’t realize, he says, how
serious they were. The guy’s wedding present is a gift certificate for
two free drinks at the bar where they met and a pair of white satin
ribbons for his crutches. During the ceremony, they both carry Kewpie
dolls that probably have some barely hidden significance, and indeed do.
The child she bears him, his or another’s, reminds him, as if he needed
reminding, that time is fast moving on. He has responsibilities now and
he decides to check whether he still has the job that he had when he
first met her. He does. His absence, if he has been absent, is not
remarked on, but he is not congratulated on his marriage, either, no
doubt because—it comes back to him now—before he met his wife he was
engaged to one of his colleagues and their co-workers had already thrown
them an engagement party, so they must resent the money they spent on
gifts. It’s embarrassing and the atmosphere is somewhat hostile, but he
has a child in kindergarten and another on the way, so what can he do?
Well, he still hasn’t cashed in the gift certificate, so, for one thing,
what the hell, he can go for a beer, two, in fact, and he can afford a
third. There’s a young woman sitting near him who looks like she’s
probably good in bed, but she’s not his wife and he has no desire to
commit adultery, or so he tells himself, as he sits on the edge of her
bed with his pants around his ankles. Is he taking them off or putting
them on? He’s not sure, but now he pulls them on and limps home, having
left his beribboned crutches somewhere. On arrival, he finds all the
Kewpie dolls, which were put on a shelf when the babies started coming,
now scattered about the apartment, beheaded and with their limbs
amputated. One of the babies is crying, so, while he warms up a bottle
of milk on the stove, he goes into its room to give it a pacifier and
discovers a note from his wife pinned to its pajamas, which says that
she has gone off to the hospital to have another baby and she’d better
not find him here when she gets back, because if she does she’ll kill
him. He believes her, so he’s soon out on the streets again, wondering
if he ever gave that bottle to the baby, or if it’s still boiling away
on the stove. He passes the old neighborhood bar and is tempted but
decides that he has had enough trouble for one lifetime and is about to
walk on when he is stopped by that hulk who beat him up and who now
gives him a cigar because he’s just become a father and drags him into
the bar for a celebratory drink, or, rather, several, he has lost count.
The celebrations are already over, however, and the new father, who has
married the same woman who threw him out, is crying in his beer about
the miseries of married life and congratulating him on being well out of
it, a lucky man. But he doesn’t feel lucky, especially when he sees a
young woman sitting near them who looks like she’s probably good in bed
and decides to suggest that they go to her place, but too late—she’s
already out the door with the guy who beat him up and stole his wife. So
he has another beer, wondering where he’s supposed to live now, and
realizing—it’s the bartender who so remarks while offering him another
on the house—that life is short and brutal and before he knows it he’ll
be dead. He’s right. After a few more beers and orgasms, some vaguely
remembered, most not, one of his sons, now a race-car driver and the
president of the company he used to work for, comes to visit him on his
deathbed and, apologizing for arriving so late (I went for a beer, Dad,
things happened), says he’s going to miss him but it’s probably for the
best. For the best what? he asks, but his son is gone, if he was ever
there in the first place. Well…you know…life, he says to the nurse who
has come to pull the sheet over his face and wheel him away.</p>
