<h4 id="the-courtesy">The Courtesy</h4>
<p>By John Berger (2002)</p>
<p>In a square in Lisboa, there is a tree called a Lusitanian cypress.
Its branches, instead of pointing up to the sky, have been trained to
grow outward, horizontally, so that they form a gigantic, impenetrable
low umbrella. A hundred people could easily shelter under it. The
branches are supported by metal props, arranged in circles around the
twisted massive trunk; the tree is at least two hundred years old.
Beside it stands a formal notice board with a poem. I paused to try to
decipher a few lines: “I am the handle of your hoe, the gate of your
house, the wood of your cradle and of your own coffin.”</p>
<p>Nearby, chickens were pecking on unkempt grass. Men were playing
sueca, each one selecting and then placing his card on the table with an
expression that combined wisdom and resignation. Winning was a quiet
pleasure.</p>
<p>It was the end of May. In a week or two, Africa, which begins—in a
manner of speaking—on the far bank of the Tagus, would start to impose
its distant yet tangible presence. A man carrying a suitcase crossed the
square with the air of someone going to a rendezvous that he kept every
day. A woman holding a little dog in her arms walked past on her way
toward the Avenida da Liberdade. There was an old woman with an
umbrella, sitting very still on one of the park benches. She had the
kind of stillness that draws attention to itself—she seemed to want her
presence to be noticed. But by whom?</p>
<p>Abruptly, she got to her feet, turned, and, using her umbrella like a
walking stick, came toward me.</p>
<p>I recognized her walk long before I could see her face. The walk of
somebody already looking forward to arriving and sitting down. It was my
mother.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>It happens sometimes in my dreams that I have to phone my parents’
flat, in order to tell them—or to ask them to tell somebody else—that
I’m likely to be late, because I’ve missed a connection. I want to warn
them that I’m not where I’m meant to be. But I don’t have my address
book with me, and although I attempt to remember their telephone number
and I try out several variations, I never find the right one. This
corresponds with the truth that in my waking life I have forgotten the
telephone number of the flat where my parents lived for twenty years.
But what I forget in my dreams is that my parents are dead. My father
died twenty-five years ago and my mother ten years later.</p>
<p>In the square, she took my arm and we walked slowly toward the Mãe
d’Água staircase.</p>
<p>There’s something, John, you shouldn’t forget. And it’s this: the
dead don’t stay where they are buried.</p>
<p>As she spoke, she looked concentratedly at the ground a few metres
ahead of us, as if she were worried about tripping.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about Heaven, she said. Heaven is all very well, but
I happen to be talking about something different. She paused and chewed
as if one of the words had gristle on it and needed more chewing before
being swallowed. Then she went on. The dead when they’re dead can choose
where they want to live on earth, always supposing they decide to stay
on the earth.</p>
<p>We were at the top of the stairway. She took hold of the rail, and we
walked three steps down.</p>
<p>How do the dead choose where they want to stay?</p>
<p>She didn’t answer; instead, she gathered up her skirt and sat down on
the next step of the staircase.</p>
<p>I’ve chosen Lisboa! she said, as if repeating something very
obvious.</p>
<p>Did you ever come here—I hesitated, for I didn’t want to make the
distinction too blatant—before?</p>
<p>Again she ignored the question.</p>
<p>Is Father here?</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>Where is he?</p>
<p>I don’t know and I don’t ask him. I fancy he may be in Rome.</p>
<p>Because of the Holy See?</p>
<p>For the first time, she looked at me, a little triumph of a joke in
her eyes.</p>
<p>Not at all—because of the tablecloths!</p>
<p>I put my arm around her. Gently she removed my hand from her arm,
and, still holding it, placed it on the stone step.</p>
<p>Don’t you remember my warning you? I told you it would be like this.
Beyond days or months or hundreds of years, beyond time.</p>
<p>She was peering toward Africa.</p>
<p>So time doesn’t count and place does? I said this to tease her. I had
liked teasing her, and she went along with it.</p>
<p>When I was a child, her sureness enraged me. It was a sureness that
revealed a vulnerability behind the bravura, a hesitancy, whereas I
wanted her to be invincible. Consequently, I would contradict whatever
it was that she was being so certain about. Yet my counterattacks made
her even more frail.</p>
<p>So time doesn’t count and place does? I asked again.</p>
<p>It’s not just any place, my boy. There aren’t many cities left with
trams, are there? Here you can hear them all the while—except for a few
hours during the night. There’s hardly a street in the center of Lisboa
where you can’t hear trams.</p>
<p>It was a No. 194, wasn’t it? We took it every Wednesday from East to
South Croydon and back. First we shopped in Surrey Street market, then
we went to the Davies Picture Palace, with an electric organ changing
color when the man played it.</p>
<p>I knew the organist, she said. I bought celery for him in the
market.</p>
<p>You also bought kidneys.</p>
<p>Your father enjoyed them for breakfast.</p>
<p>Like Leopold Bloom.</p>
<p>Don’t show off! There’s nobody here to notice. You always wanted to
sit in the front of the tram upstairs. Yes, it was a 194.</p>
<p>And climbing up the stairs of the tram, you complained, Ah, my legs,
my poor legs!</p>
<p>You wanted to be up in front because there you could drive and wanted
me to watch you drive.</p>
<p>I loved the corners! Do you remember the sparks?</p>
<p>In the damn rain, yes.</p>
<p>Driving after the cinema was best.</p>
<p>I never saw anyone look as hard as you did, sitting on the edge of
your seat.</p>
<p>In the tram?</p>
<p>In the tram and in the cinema, too.</p>
<p>You often cried in the cinema, I told her. You had a way of dabbing
at your eyes.</p>
<p>Shall I tell you something? I don’t suppose you’ve noticed the tower
of Santa Justa, just down there? It’s owned by the Lisboa Tramway
Company. There’s a lift in it, and the lift goes nowhere, really. It
takes people up, they take a look around from the platform, and then it
brings the same people down. Now, a film, John, can do the same thing.
It takes you up and brings you back to the same place. That’s one of the
reasons people cry in the cinema.</p>
<p>She licked her lower lip, with a gesture she once used after applying
lipstick. On one of the roofs above the Mãe d’Água staircase a woman was
singing as she pegged out sheets on a line to dry. Her voice was
plaintive, and the sheets were very white.</p>
<p>When I first came to Lisboa, my mother said, I came down in that lift
of the Santa Justa. I have never been up in it—you understand? I came
down in it. As we all do. That’s why it was built. And do you know the
first thing I saw, when I stepped out of the lift? A shop for digital
photography!</p>
<p>She got to her feet and started climbing back up the staircase. She
had difficulty breathing, and so, to make it easier, to encourage
herself, she blew out long hisses between her lips, pursed as if for
whistling. It was she who first taught me to whistle.</p>
<p>I am not leaving this place, she said when we reached the top. For
the moment, I’m waiting. Whereupon she turned around and walked back to
the bench she had been sitting on, and the square became demonstrably
still, so still that she eventually vanished.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>During the next few days, she kept herself hidden. I wandered around
the city. I wasn’t looking for her. But from time to time something
reminded me of her—usually something only half seen.</p>
<p>Lisboa is a hiding place. It has a relationship with the visible
world like no other city’s. It plays games. Its squares and streets are
paved with patterns of white and colored stones, and its walls are
covered with the famous azulejo tiles. The tiles depict fabulous things:
a monkey playing pipes, a woman picking grapes, saints, whales,
crusaders in their boats, basil plants, magpies, lovers embracing, a
lion, a moreia fish with spots like a leopard. The tiles draw attention
to what can be seen.</p>
<p>At the same time, the tiles are saying something different—in fact,
the opposite. They are everywhere, and everywhere something is being
covered by their crackly white surfaces, their vivacious colors and
patterns: what’s behind them is hidden and will remain hidden
forever.</p>
<p>Perhaps Lisboa is a stopover for the dead. Perhaps here the dead show
themselves more than in any other city. The Italian novelist Antonio
Tabucchi, who loves Lisboa deeply, spent a whole day with the dead
here.</p>
<p>As I wandered around Lisboa, I got lost several times.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Once, we were trying to get out of London and had taken the wrong
road. Father stopped the car and unfolded a map. We are going far, too
far to the west, Mother said. I have a good bump for direction, a
phrenologist told me so more than once. He could feel it here. She was
touching the back of her head. She had very fine hair. He said my bump
for places was here.</p>
<p>Nobody, I retorted from the back seat, takes phrenologists seriously.
They are a bunch of crypto-Fascists.</p>
<p>Why do you say that?</p>
<p>You can’t measure a person’s gifts with a pair of calipers. And,
anyway, where did they get their norms? From the Greeks, of course.
Narrowly European. Racist.</p>
<p>The one who felt my head was Chinese, she muttered, and, anyway, he
was right about me. I have a good bump for places. We’ve come too far—we
should have turned left miles back, where we saw that poor man without
any legs. Now we may as well go on, no point in turning back now, it’s
too late!</p>
<p>“It’s too late!”—one of her favorite phrases. And, hearing it, I was
invariably filled with fury. She would pronounce the three words
lightly, without pathos, almost as if she were quoting a price: some
things are savable and others are not. My fury was directed partly at
this calm.</p>
<p>I thought of this while I drank a small cup of sharp coffee in an
Alfama bar. I looked at the faces of the other men, all over fifty and
weathered in the same way. Lisboetas often talk of a feeling, a mood,
which they call saudade. It is usually translated as “nostalgia.”
Nostalgia implies a comfort, even an indolence, such as Lisboa has never
enjoyed.</p>
<p>Saudade, I decided as I drank a second coffee and watched a drunk’s
hands carefully arranging the story he was telling, as if it were a pile
of envelopes, was a mood of fury at having to hear the words “too late”
pronounced too calmly. And fado is the unmistakable music of this
fury.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>On Sunday, I was in the Baixa district, crossing the immense Square
of Commerce. The Baixa is the only part of the old city that is flat and
low. Lisboa is surrounded on three sides by its famous hills; its fourth
side is the estuary of the Tagus, known as the Sea of Straw, because its
waters, in a certain light, have a golden sheen. Lisboa was once the
richest capital of Europe, trading in everything that defied the
Atlantic: gold, slaves from the Congo, silks, diamonds, spices. From the
fifteenth century, Lisboa’s navigators, merchants, and slave traders set
out for Africa, the Orient, and, later, Brazil.</p>
<p>Stick two cloves into each apple, she always instructed me, and then
we’ll bake them with brown sugar.</p>
<p>When she wasn’t looking, I’d stick in a third, in the conviction that
this would make the apple taste finer. If she spotted the third one,
she’d take it out and put it back in the jar. They come from Madagascar,
she explained. Waste not, want not!</p>
<p>This was another phrase that was dear to her. Yet, unlike “It’s too
late,” “Waste not, want not!” was a warning rather than a lament. A
warning that somehow applied to the Square of Commerce, I thought as I
walked across it. All its dimensions, its projected geometries, were
those of an unrealizable dream.</p>
<p>During the first week of November, 1755, an earthquake, and the tidal
wave that followed it, and the fires that came after devastated a third
of Lisboa and killed tens of thousands. While the fires were still
burning, and people had only the tattered clothes they stood up in, men
bought and sold looted diamonds among ashes and rubble. There was the
blue sky above and the golden tan of the Sea of Straw, and everywhere
there was famine and disease, punishment and retribution.</p>
<p>The next year, the Marquês de Pombal, dreaming of a new city of
reason and symmetry, began to rebuild Lisboa. He had a banker’s vision
of regular streets, perfectly kept accounts, and an immense Square of
Commerce that would be open to the trade of the entire world. But Lisboa
was neither Manchester nor Birmingham, and the industrial revolution
occurred elsewhere. Portugal would become the poorest nation in Western
Europe.</p>
<p>No matter how many people there are in the Praça do Comércio, it
always looks half empty.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>She kept little in her purse. Her gestures when handling cash were
neat and precise. She hid small sums, earmarked for certain projects, in
different envelopes or in the drawers of her dressing table, so that she
wouldn’t be tempted to spend them. Once, she lost a ten-shilling note,
which represented a third of a working woman’s monthly wage. It’s gone!
she sobbed. It’s gone! She said this as if the note were an animal that
had ungratefully run away after being given a good home. Gone!</p>
<p>When she wept, she turned away from me. This may have been to spare
me, but it was also because her tears took her back to other times,
before I had been thought of. While she was crying, I waited, as you
wait for a long train to pass at a level crossing.</p>
<p>After a while, she wiped her eyes and said, We’ll manage. All we have
to do is make a little go a long way.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>By now, I was in the Rua Augusta, one of the straight streets of the
banker’s dream. Because it was Sunday, the opticians and hairdressers,
the travel agencies and maritime-insurance offices were shut. People
were on their way to have lunch with family or friends. Many were
carrying little packages of sweetmeats, Sunday gifts, elaborately folded
and knotted with their ribbons tied in bows.</p>
<p>On the corner of the Rua da Conceição, a crowd waited, peering toward
the Madalena church. I decided to wait, too. There was no traffic. Even
the trams had been stopped.</p>
<p>I heard people cheering farther down the street. Then a hundred and
fifty runners appeared. They were moving steadily, keeping together in a
bunch, encouraging one another, with no bravura or overt
competitiveness. Men and women, teen-agers and seventy-year-olds, all
with their heads held high, some snorting like horses when they breathed
out. Their long strides beat a slow regular rhythm on the cobbles
between the tram lines.</p>
<p>A child who wanted to see better pushed me in the back, and I stepped
a little to one side. It turned out to be her. She took my hand. All her
life she had had cold hands.</p>
<p>Do you see that man’s face, she whispered. See how his face is
stretched by the effort he’s making?</p>
<p>It’s stretched into a kind of smile.</p>
<p>And the smile is acknowledging his own name!</p>
<p>What’s his name?</p>
<p>Costa. Bravo, Costa! she called.</p>
<p>And her?</p>
<p>Madalena!</p>
<p>You know all their names?</p>
<p>Madalena is smiling! Bravo, Madalena!</p>
<p>One man had Luiz written on his T-shirt. Luiz! I shouted, not to be
outdone.</p>
<p>José and Dominique! she screamed.</p>
<p>Smiling every one! I said.</p>
<p>This is not a city, my boy, that fucks itself up. That’s why I’m
here.</p>
<p>I glanced at her. She, too, was smiling, and there were many folds
around her eyes, and her old woman’s face looked like crumpled paper.
But her voice had changed. It had become the voice of a
seventeen-year-old. It had the somatic assurance, the impudence of that
age.</p>
<p>A century had passed since she was seventeen.</p>
<p>We walked in the direction of the Chiado, and, on the spur of the
moment, I found myself entering a bakery to ask whether it had a certain
dessert, a kind of custard flan with almonds called Bacon from Heaven.
Toicinho do céu. It tastes like marzipan, and has nothing to do with
bacon. My mother stayed outside. I bought two portions, and the baker’s
wife made a package with a ribbon the color of the Sea of Straw. I
stepped out into the street.</p>
<p>It’s what I like best. How on earth did you know? she asked me.</p>
<p>We found a café near the Praça de Luiz de Camões, decorated with
blue-and-white azulejo tiles.</p>
<p>The blue on these tiles is the same as Reckitt’s Blue soap, she said.
Every little square packet was wrapped in this blue.</p>
<p>I remember wringing the water out of the sheets for you.</p>
<p>There was water everywhere.</p>
<p>There were mops.</p>
<p>You helped a lot in the mornings before you started going to
school.</p>
<p>Before I went to school, Mother, nothing we did ever stopped. Can you
guess what the fabulous object in my childhood was?</p>
<p>You sound like somebody writing an autobiography. Don’t!</p>
<p>Don’t what?</p>
<p>You’re bound to get it wrong.</p>
<p>Don’t you want to guess what the most fabulous object in my childhood
was?</p>
<p>Tell me.</p>
<p>Your barometer.</p>
<p>The one beside your father’s desk? We took it with us whenever we
moved. And your father got out his toolbox and screwed it to the wall. I
forget how many times. Many, many times. It was a wedding present.</p>
<p>There’s a metal plaque pinned to it that says so. You were married on
the sixth of February, 1926, and I was born on the fifth of November the
same year.</p>
<p>It doesn’t say that! How could they know? Though I knew the very
second you were conceived.</p>
<p>I must have been conceived on your wedding night in Paris. That makes
exactly nine months.</p>
<p>Paris. I loved Paris. The pillowcases and the statue of Molière!</p>
<p>Why aren’t you there now, then? You could have chosen Paris.</p>
<p>You can’t live a honeymoon all your life.</p>
<p>No, Mama, but perhaps all your death!</p>
<p>This made her laugh until she had to dab her eyes.</p>
<p>Every day you went to the barometer, I said, and tapped the glass
with your knuckles. Then you looked at it again and announced, It’s
going up! Or, the next day, It’s coming down! I watched you when you
polished it, and I saw the secret smile on your face and knew that you
had changed what was going to happen! The needle would shift, the
prophesy would be different. It would be closer to Fair, leaving Change
farther behind. On other days, if you were anxious, you tapped hard on
the glass, and the needle shifted closer to Stormy. And it was never
wrong. If it pointed to Stormy, stormy it would be.</p>
<p>So you believed I was in control?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I kept many things under control.</p>
<p>Never me!</p>
<p>I never tried with you.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>People try to control what risks getting out of control. I left you
alone from the beginning.</p>
<p>I felt alone.</p>
<p>To my great surprise, my boy, you were free.</p>
<p>I was scared by one thing after another. I still am.</p>
<p>Naturally. How could it be otherwise? You can be fearless or you can
be free. You can’t be both.</p>
<p>To know how to be both is surely the aim of all philosophy,
Mother.</p>
<p>It’s not philosophy that takes you there, although love can for a few
moments. She started to nibble her favorite flan.</p>
<p>Were you there often?</p>
<p>Once or twice. When she said this she smiled.</p>
<p>You know, don’t you, I said, that after your funeral we learned, to
our considerable surprise, that you’d been married long before you met
Father?</p>
<p>Everything comes out in the wash! she said. We loved each other a
lot, the first husband and I.</p>
<p>So what made you get divorced?</p>
<p>Because I wanted to have children. She pointed at me with a finger
that had custard on it.</p>
<p>And he didn’t?</p>
<p>He and I looked at the stars together. In the beginning, I wasn’t in
a hurry. I was only seventeen. To tell the truth, I was sixteen when I
met him—1909, the year I read Maeterlinck’s “Blue Bird.” I met him in
the Tate Gallery. I went there every Sunday to look at Turner’s
paintings. He invited me to have a cup of tea—there wasn’t much coffee
in those days—and he told me all about Turner’s double life as an old
man. I thought he was an old man—though he was only half as old as you
are today And I remember wondering whether he had a double life,
too.</p>
<p>He was the first person ever to call me Miriam. At home, I’d always
been Mim. I left the stables and the warehouse horses my father looked
after, and I was Mim. I walked across the Vauxhall Bridge, and on the
other side of the Thames, where he greeted me, I was suddenly
Miriam.</p>
<p>You married him when?</p>
<p>He’d come back from India, and I thought that if I married him it
would be a way of keeping him, and I kept him for nine years. For nine
years he was happy with his wife.</p>
<p>He didn’t work?</p>
<p>He wondered about things, he asked questions. And I learned and I
read, so I could talk with him. Sometimes we talked all night. He’d wake
me up and take me out into the garden; we had a big garden, and at the
bottom of it was a bust of Seneca, and nobody could see us, and we’d
stand there like Adam and Eve watching the sun come up.</p>
<p>Like Adam and Eve?</p>
<p>Naked.</p>
<p>The house was where?</p>
<p>Croydon.</p>
<p>Croydon! I shouted in surprise.</p>
<p>Sh-h-h! Don’t shout, people don’t shout in this city. And I still
remember the words I learned by heart sitting under that statue. “You
must want nothing if you wish to challenge Jupiter, who himself wants
nothing!”</p>
<p>But by now you wanted children and Jupiter didn’t!</p>
<p>Don’t be vulgar. Alfred worshipped me. Do you understand? He made me
feel very beautiful. Your father was a more manly man. Alfred worshipped
me.</p>
<p>Did Father meet Alfred?</p>
<p>After the divorce, he became a tramp.</p>
<p>That must have been hard on you.</p>
<p>It was what he wanted.</p>
<p>I think I saw him once.</p>
<p>You couldn’t have!</p>
<p>One day in Croydon you left me in a big store.</p>
<p>Kennards!</p>
<p>You left me in the toy department.</p>
<p>You loved watching the trains. The new electric trains.</p>
<p>You took me to the toy department and said, Wait here, John, I won’t
be gone long. I waited. The trains seemed to go slower and slower. I
wasn’t worried, but it was a long while. I watched the signals change
color a thousand times. When you came back, you looked very flushed, as
if you’d been running. We took the lift straight down to the ground
floor. Outside, behind the store, in a back street, a man blocked our
way, and you put your handkerchief up to your face. His clothes were
held together with string. He had a straggling beard. And his
expression! I couldn’t take my eyes off his face.</p>
<p>Alfred! my mother whispered.</p>
<p>He was large, I said, and his decrepitude made him look larger still.
You remember what happened next? He gave you something in a packet.</p>
<p>It was some letters. He said he didn’t have anyplace to keep them now
that he was on the street, and he couldn’t bring himself to destroy
them, so he wanted to give them back.</p>
<p>They still exist?</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>I burned them, burned them as soon as we got home.</p>
<p>Then he put out a filthy hand and ruffled my hair and he said to you,
He needs taking care of.</p>
<p>My mother started to cry in the café with the blue-and-white
azulejos.</p>
<p>You were still in love with him?</p>
<p>He had eyes that burned through you.</p>
<p>The moment I saw him I knew you’d been with him that afternoon, I
said.</p>
<p>He died soon after. He was knocked down by a car.</p>
<p>She put her hands up to her face to hide it.</p>
<p>It’s dangerous, she muttered, to live on just virtue, or what Seneca
called wisdom. It leads to addiction, like drink. I’ve seen it.</p>
<p>Why did he say I needed taking care of?</p>
<p>She lowered her hands.</p>
<p>He could tell by looking at you. You were ten, and you had a mouth
that was always hanging open.</p>
<p>Did he know that you had children?</p>
<p>I hid nothing from him.</p>
<p>A face so full of pain, I said.</p>
<p>There followed a long silence and we both looked out the window and
watched the white of the buildings and the blue of the sky.</p>
<p>Then she said, Alfred taught me and I taught you and I’m telling you
that what you saw in his face wasn’t only pain. Not only pain. I’m going
to take a little rest now.</p>
<p>She got to her feet and walked slowly toward the toilets.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>She is serving mashed potatoes. Nice and fluffy, she says, still
stirring them with a fork. She wears a kerchief over her hair. She
worked all day in the kitchen of the teahouse in which we lived. She
suffered from the heat of the stoves, yet when she sucked her fingers
because they had icing sugar or homemade custard on them she couldn’t
help smiling: she was a good cook. I see her writing in her diary. She
bought herself one every year, often waiting until February, when they
were cheaper. The diaries she chose invariably had a small thin pencil
attached to them. The pencil slipped through a loop and lay along the
golden edges of the pages. Smaller and thinner than a cigarette—she
smoked a brand of cigarettes called Dumaurier—it was often the only
pencil we could find to write something down with. Sometimes I drew with
it. Be sure to give it back to me. It was always carefully reinserted
into its loop. And with it she makes her diary entries, noting her rare
appointments and, each day, systematically, the weather. Morning: rain.
Afternoon: bright patches.</p>
<p>The trams in the center of Lisboa are very different from the red
double-decker ones that used to run in Croydon; they are as cramped as
small fishing boats and they are lemon-yellow. Their drivers, as they
negotiate the steep one-way streets and nose their way around blind
jetties, give the impression of hauling in ropes and holding rudders
rather than turning wheels and operating levers. Yet, despite the sudden
descents, the lurches, the choppiness, the passengers, mostly elderly,
remain contemplative and calm—as if they were sitting in their living
rooms. And, indeed, in places the trams, with their open windows, sway
so close to these rooms that it would be easy with one’s hand to touch a
birdcage hanging from a balcony and with a little push set it
swinging.</p>
<p>I had caught the No. 28. It goes to the old cemetery, the Prazeres
(the Pleasures), where the mausoleums have front doors with windowpanes
and you can look at the abodes of the departed. Many are furnished with
low tables, chairs, bunks with bedspreads, rugs, photographs. One has a
pair of dancing shoes. Another has a bicycle and a fishing rod.</p>
<p>As the tram was passing through the district of Bairro Alto, I saw my
mother. Like other pedestrians on the narrow street, she was flattening
herself against a shop front to let the tram pass. She spotted me, and,
at the next corner where the tram stopped and its two sets of doors
unfolded noisily like wooden curtains, she climbed aboard, took a ticket
out of her purse, and, using her umbrella as a stick, as usual, came to
stand beside me and slip her arm through mine.</p>
<p>At the next stop, she said, we’re going to the market, I take it?</p>
<p>Yes, that was my idea.</p>
<p>We get off, she said, in one minute and it’s downhill all the way to
the Mercado da Ribeira.</p>
<p>She led me, tripping light-footedly, umbrella scarcely touching the
flagstones, past the vegetables and fruit, to the avenues of fish. It
crossed my mind that the Mercado da Ribeira was why she had chosen to
come to Lisboa.</p>
<p>Large fish markets are strange places. Entering one, you enter
another kingdom. The stony sea urchins, the locust lobsters, the
lampreys, the squids, the rings, the turbots insist that here the
measures of time and space are different. There are forty-five thousand
species of shellfish, all of them eaters, all of them constituting food
for others.</p>
<p>She bent over a basket of lady crabs. Their dark shells were like
brown velvet, soft to the touch, and their legs were smeared with blue,
as if they had sidled their way through oil.</p>
<p>The choicest of all crabs, she said. Here they call them naralheira
felpuda. Felpuda means “hairy.”</p>
<p>I’ve learned a lot since my death. You should use me while you’re
here. You can look things up in a dead person the way you can in a
dictionary. She straightened her back and looked into my eyes with an
expression I hadn’t seen before. It was one of happy impertinence.</p>
<p>We walked down one of the aisles, past flounders, tuna, John Dories,
mackerels, sardines, anchovies, sabre fish.</p>
<p>The sabre, she said, comes up from his depths only on nights with a
full moon.</p>
<p>The fishmongers were women. Women with strong shoulders, hefty
forearms, wearing rubber boots, handling the ice as if it were hot
metal. Their tied scarves and their eyes were very feminine. They
treated the fish as they might treat distant, mildly irritating members
of their families. We walked down another aisle and passed a slab on
which there were a dozen of the reddest fish I’ve seen—a scarlet
fire-red, such as no flower has, even a tropical one.</p>
<p>Atlantic redfish, she murmured.</p>
<p>I’ve always put life before writing, I said.</p>
<p>Don’t boast.</p>
<p>It’s true.</p>
<p>Then pass over it in silence.</p>
<p>We stopped before a bank of salmon.</p>
<p>Salmon was Father’s favorite dish, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Yes, she said, but since his death he prefers swordfish. The
espadarte! The espadarte with its upper beak, like a blade, slashes out
left and right, to kill the fish it is hunting. It was a
swordfish—wasn’t it?—that the old man of the sea wrestled with in
Hemingway’s story. The book made me think of your father and of life in
the trenches during the Great War. What’s the connection? I can’t
explain everything. The story made me think of your father and the war.
I can’t explain why.</p>
<p>A connection of courage?</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>I never saw a man who wept as often as your father and I never knew a
man who was half as brave.</p>
<p>I took her arm.</p>
<p>The strangest thing of all is that the flesh of the espadarte, this
huge fish, when it is marinated and cooked, is the most delicate. It
dissolves in the mouth like a soufflé. Each time, after I’ve cooked it,
I place it on his plate like a kiss.</p>
<p>He comes to eat it here?</p>
<p>Of course not. He’ll eat it, wherever he is, when he happens to think
of me. Just as I think of him, when I’m preparing it.</p>
<p>Do we have to find an espadarte, I asked, or can we just think of
one, as we’re doing now?</p>
<p>What are you saying? I told you it has to be marinated in lemon juice
and olive oil! So we have to find lemons and a green pepper and a yellow
pepper and a red one. You cut up the peppers and put them in the pan so
they give off their liquid, then you pop in the fish. Takes very little
time to cook—it must never be overcooked. Best to put a lid on the pan.
Some serve it with capers. I don’t. I’ll get the fish. You go and find
the lemon and peppers.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>She didn’t turn up again for several days.</p>
<p>The weather was gusty with squalls of Atlantic rain. I had an anorak
pulled over my head, and I was crossing another square, the Campo dos
Mártires da Pátria, named after the martyrs of the fatherland. They were
executed by hanging, in 1817. All twelve of them were Freemasons,
accused of being conspirators against the monarchy. The English were
governing the country, and the execution was ordered by Marshal
Beresford. As the twelve were being blindfolded, they prayed for the
city. They were killed here, exactly where a roundabout now is.</p>
<p>The square, with its trams and unending traffic, is still full of
prayers. You edge your way among prayers, as among cattle in a livestock
market—the prayers for the martyrs or for the dead, lying in the morgue,
just north of the square, or the prayers of those who have come here to
be blessed by the man whose statue is in the middle of the roundabout,
Dr. José Thomas de Sousa Martins. Around the statue stand stone tablets,
which look like headstones for graves—some leaning against the plinth of
the statue, others against one another. But they are not tombstones;
what is written on them is prayers of thanks to the doctor who once
cured a cirrhosis, or a bronchitis, or hemorrhoids, a case of impotence,
a child’s asthma, or a woman’s stress. Some of the cures were performed
after his death.</p>
<p>Dr. Sousa looked somewhat like my Uncle Edgar, my father’s elder
brother, a man of learning who never stopped learning. He was a man of
ideals who never despaired. He was also a man whom everyone, including
my mother, treated as a failure. He had a wart on the middle finger of
his right hand where he held his pen, writing hundreds of pages of a
book that nobody published or even read. What the two faces had in
common was an unusual looseness about the mouth, indicating not weakness
but a desire to kiss rather than to bite. They also had similar
foreheads—not of imposing intelligence but of immense, inspiring calm.
Today, a century after his death, Dr. Sousa is referred to in Lisboa as
Doctor of the Heavens and of the Earth. And my Uncle Edgar still
demonstrates to me the power of reticent love.</p>
<p>The wind was smacking wet, and the gulls were flying very low over
the roofs. It was a day when people turned their backs to the sea if
they had no one out on it.</p>
<p>Women, crouched under dark umbrellas, were selling candles. Three
sizes of candle, priced accordingly, though no price was marked. The
largest were thirty centimetres tall, their wax the color of parchment.
Near the statue of the doctor, candles were burning on two metal tables.
The tabletops, encrusted with old melted wax, had spikes for impaling
the new candles, and a tall metal sheet behind to cut the wind. I
watched the flames. They flickered, they guttered, they were blown
sideways as from a toy dragon’s mouth.</p>
<p>Slowly the idea came to me to buy and light some candles myself. I
was thinking of a friend who, at that moment, felt lost.</p>
<p>I bought three of the tallest candles, which would burn the longest,
and I walked over to one of the tables and impaled them, one after the
other. Only then did it occur to me that I should have lit one first
from a burning candle. Now it would be difficult in the wind to light
them with a match, and anyway I didn’t have any matches.</p>
<p>As I realized my mistake, a woman behind me offered me a small
candle. I took it, without looking around, not doubting for a moment who
had offered it to me. Then I stood there, mesmerized by the three new,
flickering flames.</p>
<p>When I did at last turn, I was amazed to discover that the woman
behind me was not my mother.</p>
<p>I’m so sorry, I blurted out, I thought you were my mother! I spoke in
French, which is the language I fall back on when I’m confused.</p>
<p>I think I’m almost young enough to be your daughter, she replied
lightly, speaking French with a Portuguese accent. I gave her back her
candle, which was still burning, and I bowed.</p>
<p>She had blue eyes. Her face was strong but unprotected. Senhora, can
I offer you a coffee out of the rain? I asked.</p>
<p>No, I’ll place my candle and then I must get home. It’s for my
husband.</p>
<p>He’s ill?</p>
<p>No, he’s not ill. He had an accident—fell off the roof he was working
on.</p>
<p>Is he badly hurt?</p>
<p>She stared at my chest, as if it were the distant Sea of Straw. I
knew then that he was dead.</p>
<p>You should have brought an umbrella like me, she said. Our candles
will go on burning, doing whatever they can without us.</p>
<p>I stepped off the roundabout and found a café. I went inside and took
off my soaked anorak. The café was full of people, and many of them were
particularly well dressed. I heard German and English. The clientele, I
concluded, were probably from the nearby embassies.</p>
<p>So this morning you went to see Dr. Sousa. There was a good man! Some
of us still go to consult him.</p>
<p>I heard her say this, yet I couldn’t see her. I was sitting
alone.</p>
<p>What do they complain of, I whisper—your friends who consult him?</p>
<p>Many suffer from hopefulness. Among us hopefulness is as common as
depression among the living.</p>
<p>You see hopefulness as an illness?</p>
<p>One of its terminal symptoms is a desire to intervene again in
life.</p>
<p>Is there a cure?</p>
<p>Dr. Sousa prescribes a spell with the martyrs!</p>
<p>It seems he loved women, I told her, and sometimes he prescribed
himself as the cure.</p>
<p>She laughed. A crystalline laugh, as if all the people in the café
were clinking glasses. Nobody else gave any sign of hearing it.</p>
<p>If they made a film about him, he’d be played by Groucho Marx, she
said.</p>
<p>In the Davies Picture Palace, the two of us saw “A Night at the
Opera” and “Duck Soup.” Her laughter in the cinema had been muffled, as
if she didn’t want to draw attention to our presence, which bordered on
being illicit—because neither of us had mentioned our visit to the
Picture Palace to anybody else, and, in a more direct sense, because she
had contrived to get us in without paying. A question of narrow
uncarpeted stairs and safety exits.</p>
<p>All my books have been about you, I suddenly said.</p>
<p>Nonsense! Maybe you wrote them so I should be there, keeping you
company. And I was. Yet they were about everything in the world but me!
I’ve had to wait until now, until you are an old man in Lisboa, for you
to be writing this very short story about me.</p>
<p>Books are also about language, and language for me is inseparable
from your voice.</p>
<p>You’re trying to be clever. Don’t. Just think of me. Then you’ll
learn endurance. Something that can be learned only from a woman, never
from a man.</p>
<p>Scott in the Antarctic?</p>
<p>Think of Scott’s wife. Her name was Kathleen. I regret, Kathleen
said, nothing but his suffering.</p>
<p>Why did you never read any of my books?</p>
<p>I liked books that took me to another life—a life I might have lived.
That’s why I read the books I did. Many. When I read them, I lost all
sense of time. Your books, I hoped, were about another life but one I
wanted only to imagine. So it was better that I didn’t read them. I
could see them through the glass door of the bookcase. That was enough
for me.</p>
<p>I risk writing nonsense these days.</p>
<p>You put something down and you don’t immediately know what it is. It
has always been like that, she said. All you need to know is whether
you’re lying or telling the truth. You can’t afford to make a mistake
about that distinction any longer.</p>
<p>I was thirteen when she had to have all her teeth pulled. She was
brought back home in a taxi. I stood at the door of her bedroom. She lay
on her back, chin protruding, cheeks hollow through the new lack of
teeth. I knew I had to choose between two things. I could scream or I
could go and lie beside her. So I lay beside her. She was too artful to
show her pleasure immediately. We both had to wait. After several
minutes, she pulled an arm out from under the bedclothes and held my
wrist in her cold hand. She kept her eyes shut. Most people, she said,
can’t stand the truth. It’s too bad but there it is, most people can’t
stand it. You, John, I think you can bear the truth, we’ll see. Time
will tell.</p>
<p>Where do I see you again? I asked.</p>
<p>On the aqueduct. The Águas Livres Aqueduct.</p>
<p>It’s very long—fourteen kilometres, I think.</p>
<p>Where it crosses the Alcântara Valley. The arches are sixty metres
high there. From up there, you can almost see America! I’ll be waiting
for you by the sixteenth arch.</p>
<p>The sixteenth counting which way?</p>
<p>What do you think? From the Mãe d’Água. I’ll meet you there on
Tuesday morning.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>As soon as I started asking how to get up on to the aqueduct, I
understood why she had slyly made the rendezvous for the following
Tuesday. It was going to take some time. All the entrances were locked,
and one had to apply for permission from the Water Company. Even
supposing that one had a persuasive reason, there was bound to be a
bureaucratic delay. I decided I would claim that I was writing a story
about Lisbon.</p>
<p>Do you know the city well? the publicist asked me. She looked
worried, as if she had to correct too many exam papers.</p>
<p>No, I replied, I love the city but I don’t know it well. That’s why I
need your help.</p>
<p>As you are probably aware, the Águas Livres supplied water to the
city until a very few years ago. Now it doesn’t, but we keep it running
as—how do you say?—as a kind of homage. You could go up on Monday
morning with Fernando. He’s the maintenance inspector.</p>
<p>Could it be Tuesday?</p>
<p>I thought you said it was urgent.</p>
<p>Tuesday would be better.</p>
<p>Then come Tuesday.</p>
<p>Fernando turned out to be a man in his mid-sixties, awaiting
retirement. He had worked all his life for the Empresa Portuguesa das
Águas Livres. He held himself very upright for his age, and he had the
air of a man used to being alone—like a shepherd or a steeplejack. His
private passion was for the water on its long, solitary, unnatural,
improbable journey from its sources. A journey underground, overground,
and through the sky. Up there, in its ducts, the water had to be kept
cool—tranquil and transparent.</p>
<p>The aqueduct at its top is only about five metres wide and consists
of an apparently endless stone tunnel and an open, very straight path on
either side. Fernando considered the water something alive, which had to
be protected, fed, cleaned up after—almost like an animal in a zoo. Once
a week, he walked the fourteen kilometres to the water’s sources in
Belas. I think he had the impression that the water, when he approached,
recognized him.</p>
<p>I told him that I wanted to see the view, and he nodded and unlocked
a door that led into the tunnel, saying that when I was finished I could
come and find him.</p>
<p>I started walking fast down the outside path, enticed by the
aqueduct’s straightness. When I reached the far side of the valley, I
turned back and counted the arches until I found the sixteenth, which
was not far from Fernando’s open door. Later, while leaning against the
parapet opposite, I thought I heard him talking—brief sentences, as if
making notes. Yet there was nobody with him.</p>
<p>Below, there were unfinished streets and houses. A poor suburb rather
than a favela. I could see a car without wheels, a balcony the size of a
kitchen chair, a child’s swing with only one rope attached to a tree,
red tiles with concrete blocks on them to prevent them being blown away
by the Atlantic winds, a window without a frame and with a double
mattress hanging out of it, a dog on a chain, barking in the sun.</p>
<p>Do you see? she suddenly said. Everything is broken, slightly broken,
like factory rejects sold at half price. Not really damaged, only
rejects. Everything—the hills, the Sea of Straw, the child’s swing, the
car, everything is a reject, and has been so since the beginning.</p>
<p>She was sitting on a portable stool. It had three folding legs and
was very light, and she used to carry it with her so she could sit down
in public places. She was wearing a cloche hat.</p>
<p>Everything in the universe, she said, began sour, then went sweet,
and afterward became bitter.</p>
<p>Did Father enjoy his swordfish? I asked.</p>
<p>I’m talking about life, not about details, she said. There was a
mistake at the beginning.</p>
<p>I don’t understand.</p>
<p>One day, when you’re in my situation, you will. The Creation, she
continued, began with a death.</p>
<p>Two white butterflies were circling above her hat. Perhaps they had
come with her, for there was little on the aqueduct at that height to
attract butterflies.</p>
<p>Surely, I asked, the Creation would begin with a birth?</p>
<p>You’d think so, but now I see it wasn’t like that. The births came
later. Precisely because they offered the chance of repairing some of
what was damaged after the death. That’s why we are here, John. To
repair.</p>
<p>Yet you are not really here, are you?</p>
<p>How stupid can you get! We—us—we are all here. Just as you and the
living are here—to repair a little of what was broken. This is why we
occurred.</p>
<p>Occurred?</p>
<p>Came to be. Don’t forget, she said, one thing repaired changes a
thousand others!</p>
<p>At this point, she got up from her stool.</p>
<p>The dog down there, she remarked, is on too short a chain. Change it,
lengthen it. Then he’ll be able to reach the shade, and he’ll lie down
and stop barking. And the silence will remind the mother that she wanted
a canary in a cage in the kitchen. And when the canary sings she’ll do
more ironing. And the father’s shoulders in a freshly ironed shirt will
ache less when he goes to work. And so when he comes home he’ll
sometimes joke, as he once did, with his teen-age daughter. And the
daughter will change her mind and decide, exceptionally, to bring her
lover home one evening. And on another evening the father will propose
to the young man that they go fishing together.</p>
<p>The dog was still barking.</p>
<p>Write down whatever you find, and do us the courtesy of noticing
us.</p>
<p>You are no longer here!</p>
<p>Hence the courtesy, John!</p>
<p>After saying this, she handed me the folding stool, and proceeded to
the door that Fernando had left unlocked. She tugged it open and
stepped—as if she had done the same thing every morning of her life—over
the water duct, up onto the narrow flagged walkway.</p>
<p>Inside, the air was cooler, as if we were underground instead of in
the sky. Every fifty metres, the vaulted roof opened out into a small
tower, which was built so that daylight could enter through it. The
daylight fell like a golden curtain. In the quiet, we heard the
lapping—as discreet as a cat’s tongue when drinking—of water flowing
down the channels on its way to the Mãe d’Água.</p>
<p>I don’t know how long we stood there facing each other—perhaps we had
been there for the fifteen years since her death. After the death of a
mother, time often accelerates, no?</p>
<p>Eventually, she turned, bit her lower lip, and began to walk away.
The courtesy, John! she said, without looking back.</p>
<p>She approached the first cascade of light. On either side, the water
reflected sparks that bobbed up and down like floating candles. When she
entered the light, it hid her like a curtain, and I did not see her
again until she came out on the far side. She seemed to be walking with
increasing ease; the farther away she got, the more sprightly she
became. She was small because of the distance. She disappeared into the
