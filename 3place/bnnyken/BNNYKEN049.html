<h4 id="what-you-pawn-i-will-redeem">What You Pawn I Will Redeem</h4>
<p>By Sherman Alexie (2003)</p>
<p>NOON</p>
<p>One day you have a home and the next you don’t, but I’m not going to
tell you my particular reasons for being homeless, because it’s my
secret story, and Indians have to work hard to keep secrets from hungry
white folks.</p>
<p>I’m a Spokane Indian boy, an Interior Salish, and my people have
lived within a hundred-mile radius of Spokane, Washington, for at least
ten thousand years. I grew up in Spokane, moved to Seattle twenty-three
years ago for college, flunked out after two semesters, worked various
blue- and bluer-collar jobs, married two or three times, fathered two or
three kids, and then went crazy. Of course, crazy is not the official
definition of my mental problem, but I don’t think asocial disorder fits
it, either, because that makes me sound like I’m a serial killer or
something. I’ve never hurt another human being, or, at least, not
physically. I’ve broken a few hearts in my time, but we’ve all done
that, so I’m nothing special in that regard. I’m a boring heartbreaker,
too. I never dated or married more than one woman at a time. I didn’t
break hearts into pieces overnight. I broke them slowly and carefully.
And I didn’t set any land-speed records running out the door. Piece by
piece, I disappeared. I’ve been disappearing ever since.</p>
<p>I’ve been homeless for six years now. If there’s such a thing as an
effective homeless man, then I suppose I’m effective. Being homeless is
probably the only thing I’ve ever been good at. I know where to get the
best free food. I’ve made friends with restaurant and convenience-store
managers who let me use their bathrooms. And I don’t mean the public
bathrooms, either. I mean the employees’ bathrooms, the clean ones
hidden behind the kitchen or the pantry or the cooler. I know it sounds
strange to be proud of this, but it means a lot to me, being trustworthy
enough to piss in somebody else’s clean bathroom. Maybe you don’t
understand the value of a clean bathroom, but I do.</p>
<p>Probably none of this interests you. Homeless Indians are everywhere
in Seattle. We’re common and boring, and you walk right on by us, with
maybe a look of anger or disgust or even sadness at the terrible fate of
the noble savage. But we have dreams and families. I’m friends with a
homeless Plains Indian man whose son is the editor of a big-time
newspaper back East. Of course, that’s his story, but we Indians are
great storytellers and liars and mythmakers, so maybe that Plains Indian
hobo is just a plain old everyday Indian. I’m kind of suspicious of him,
because he identifies himself only as Plains Indian, a generic term, and
not by a specific tribe. When I asked him why he wouldn’t tell me
exactly what he is, he said, “Do any of us know exactly what we are?”
Yeah, great, a philosophizing Indian. “Hey,” I said, “you got to have a
home to be that homely.” He just laughed and flipped me the eagle and
walked away.</p>
<p>I wander the streets with a regular crew—my teammates, my defenders,
my posse. It’s Rose of Sharon, Junior, and me. We matter to each other
if we don’t matter to anybody else. Rose of Sharon is a big woman, about
seven feet tall if you’re measuring over-all effect and about five feet
tall if you’re only talking about the physical. She’s a Yakama Indian of
the Wishram variety. Junior is a Colville, but there are about a hundred
and ninety-nine tribes that make up the Colville, so he could be
anything. He’s good-looking, though, like he just stepped out of some
“Don’t Litter the Earth” public-service advertisement. He’s got those
great big cheekbones that are like planets, you know, with little moons
orbiting them. He gets me jealous, jealous, and jealous. If you put
Junior and me next to each other, he’s the Before Columbus Arrived
Indian and I’m the After Columbus Arrived Indian. I am living proof of
the horrible damage that colonialism has done to us Skins. But I’m not
going to let you know how scared I sometimes get of history and its
ways. I’m a strong man, and I know that silence is the best method of
dealing with white folks.</p>
<p>This whole story really started at lunchtime, when Rose of Sharon,
Junior, and I were panning the handle down at Pike Place Market. After
about two hours of negotiating, we earned five dollars—good enough for a
bottle of fortified courage from the most beautiful 7-Eleven in the
world. So we headed over that way, feeling like warrior drunks, and we
walked past this pawnshop I’d never noticed before. And that was
strange, because we Indians have built-in pawnshop radar. But the
strangest thing of all was the old powwow-dance regalia I saw hanging in
the window.</p>
<p>“That’s my grandmother’s regalia,” I said to Rose of Sharon and
Junior.</p>
<p>“How you know for sure?” Junior asked.</p>
<p>I didn’t know for sure, because I hadn’t seen that regalia in person
ever. I’d only seen photographs of my grandmother dancing in it. And
those were taken before somebody stole it from her, fifty years ago. But
it sure looked like my memory of it, and it had all the same color
feathers and beads that my family sewed into our powwow regalia.</p>
<p>“There’s only one way to know for sure,” I said.</p>
<p>So Rose of Sharon, Junior, and I walked into the pawnshop and greeted
the old white man working behind the counter.</p>
<p>“How can I help you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“That’s my grandmother’s powwow regalia in your window,” I said.
“Somebody stole it from her fifty years ago, and my family has been
searching for it ever since.”</p>
<p>The pawnbroker looked at me like I was a liar. I understood.
Pawnshops are filled with liars.</p>
<p>“I’m not lying,” I said. “Ask my friends here. They’ll tell you.”</p>
<p>“He’s the most honest Indian I know,” Rose of Sharon said.</p>
<p>“All right, honest Indian,” the pawnbroker said. “I’ll give you the
benefit of the doubt. Can you prove it’s your grandmother’s
regalia?”</p>
<p>Because they don’t want to be perfect, because only God is perfect,
Indian people sew flaws into their powwow regalia. My family always
sewed one yellow bead somewhere on our regalia. But we always hid it so
that you had to search really hard to find it.</p>
<p>“If it really is my grandmother’s,” I said, “there will be one yellow
bead hidden somewhere on it.”</p>
<p>“All right, then,” the pawnbroker said. “Let’s take a look.”</p>
<p>He pulled the regalia out of the window, laid it down on the glass
counter, and we searched for that yellow bead and found it hidden
beneath the armpit.</p>
<p>“There it is,” the pawnbroker said. He didn’t sound surprised. “You
were right. This is your grandmother’s regalia.”</p>
<p>“It’s been missing for fifty years,” Junior said.</p>
<p>“Hey, Junior,” I said. “It’s my family’s story. Let me tell it.”</p>
<p>“All right,” he said. “I apologize. You go ahead.”</p>
<p>“It’s been missing for fifty years,” I said.</p>
<p>“That’s his family’s sad story,” Rose of Sharon said. “Are you going
to give it back to him?”</p>
<p>“That would be the right thing to do,” the pawnbroker said. “But I
can’t afford to do the right thing. I paid a thousand dollars for this.
I can’t just give away a thousand dollars.”</p>
<p>“We could go to the cops and tell them it was stolen,” Rose of Sharon
said.</p>
<p>“Hey,” I said to her. “Don’t go threatening people.”</p>
<p>The pawnbroker sighed. He was thinking about the possibilities.</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose you could go to the cops,” he said. “But I don’t
think they’d believe a word you said.”</p>
<p>He sounded sad about that. As if he was sorry for taking advantage of
our disadvantages.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” the pawnbroker asked me.</p>
<p>“Jackson,” I said.</p>
<p>“Is that first or last?”</p>
<p>“Both,” I said.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s true. My mother and father named me Jackson Jackson. My
family nickname is Jackson Squared. My family is funny.”</p>
<p>“All right, Jackson Jackson,” the pawnbroker said. “You wouldn’t
happen to have a thousand dollars, would you?”</p>
<p>“We’ve got five dollars total,” I said.</p>
<p>“That’s too bad,” he said, and thought hard about the possibilities.
“I’d sell it to you for a thousand dollars if you had it. Heck, to make
it fair, I’d sell it to you for nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars.
I’d lose a dollar. That would be the moral thing to do in this case. To
lose a dollar would be the right thing.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got five dollars total,” I said again.</p>
<p>“That’s too bad,” he said once more, and thought harder about the
possibilities. “How about this? I’ll give you twenty-four hours to come
up with nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars. You come back here at
lunchtime tomorrow with the money and I’ll sell it back to you. How does
that sound?”</p>
<p>“It sounds all right,” I said.</p>
<p>“All right, then,” he said. “We have a deal. And I’ll get you
started. Here’s twenty bucks.”</p>
<p>He opened up his wallet and pulled out a crisp twenty-dollar bill and
gave it to me. And Rose of Sharon, Junior, and I walked out into the
daylight to search for nine hundred and seventy-four more dollars.</p>
<p>1 p.m.</p>
<p>Rose of Sharon, Junior, and I carried our twenty-dollar bill and our
five dollars in loose change over to the 7-Eleven and bought three
bottles of imagination. We needed to figure out how to raise all that
money in only one day. Thinking hard, we huddled in an alley beneath the
Alaska Way Viaduct and finished off those bottles—one, two, and
three.</p>
<p>2 p.m.</p>
<p>Rose of Sharon was gone when I woke up. I heard later that she had
hitchhiked back to Toppenish and was living with her sister on the
reservation.</p>
<p>Junior had passed out beside me and was covered in his own vomit, or
maybe somebody else’s vomit, and my head hurt from thinking, so I left
him alone and walked down to the water. I love the smell of ocean water.
Salt always smells like memory.</p>
<p>When I got to the wharf, I ran into three Aleut cousins, who sat on a
wooden bench and stared out at the bay and cried. Most of the homeless
Indians in Seattle come from Alaska. One by one, each of them hopped a
big working boat in Anchorage or Barrow or Juneau, fished his way south
to Seattle, jumped off the boat with a pocketful of cash to party hard
at one of the highly sacred and traditional Indian bars, went broke and
broker, and has been trying to find his way back to the boat and the
frozen North ever since.</p>
<p>These Aleuts smelled like salmon, I thought, and they told me they
were going to sit on that wooden bench until their boat came back.</p>
<p>“How long has your boat been gone?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Eleven years,” the elder Aleut said.</p>
<p>I cried with them for a while.</p>
<p>“Hey,” I said. “Do you guys have any money I can borrow?”</p>
<p>They didn’t.</p>
<p>3 p.m.</p>
<p>I walked back to Junior. He was still out cold. I put my face down
near his mouth to make sure he was breathing. He was alive, so I dug
around in his bluejeans pockets and found half a cigarette. I smoked it
all the way down and thought about my grandmother.</p>
<p>Her name was Agnes, and she died of breast cancer when I was
fourteen. My father always thought Agnes caught her tumors from the
uranium mine on the reservation. But my mother said the disease started
when Agnes was walking back from a powwow one night and got run over by
a motorcycle. She broke three ribs, and my mother always said those ribs
never healed right, and tumors take over when you don’t heal right.</p>
<p>Sitting beside Junior, smelling the smoke and the salt and the vomit,
I wondered if my grandmother’s cancer started when somebody stole her
powwow regalia. Maybe the cancer started in her broken heart and then
leaked out into her breasts. I know it’s crazy, but I wondered whether I
could bring my grandmother back to life if I bought back her
regalia.</p>
<p>I needed money, big money, so I left Junior and walked over to the
Real Change office.</p>
<p>4 p.m.</p>
<p>Real Change is a multifaceted organization that publishes a
newspaper, supports cultural projects that empower the poor and the
homeless, and mobilizes the public around poverty issues. Real Change’s
mission is to organize, educate, and build alliances to create solutions
to homelessness and poverty. It exists to provide a voice for poor
people in our community.</p>
<p>I memorized Real Change’s mission statement because I sometimes sell
the newspaper on the streets. But you have to stay sober to sell it, and
I’m not always good at staying sober. Anybody can sell the paper. You
buy each copy for thirty cents and sell it for a dollar, and you keep
the profit.</p>
<p>“I need one thousand four hundred and thirty papers,” I said to the
Big Boss.</p>
<p>“That’s a strange number,” he said. “And that’s a lot of papers.”</p>
<p>“I need them.”</p>
<p>The Big Boss pulled out his calculator and did the math.</p>
<p>“It will cost you four hundred and twenty-nine dollars for that
many,” he said.</p>
<p>“If I had that kind of money, I wouldn’t need to sell the
papers.”</p>
<p>“What’s going on, Jackson-to-the-Second-Power?” he asked. He is the
only person who calls me that. He’s a funny and kind man.</p>
<p>I told him about my grandmother’s powwow regalia and how much money I
needed in order to buy it back.</p>
<p>“We should call the police,” he said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to do that,” I said. “It’s a quest now. I need to win
it back by myself.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” he said. “And, to be honest, I’d give you the papers
to sell if I thought it would work. But the record for the most papers
sold in one day by one vender is only three hundred and two.”</p>
<p>“That would net me about two hundred bucks,” I said.</p>
<p>The Big Boss used his calculator. “Two hundred and eleven dollars and
forty cents,” he said.</p>
<p>“That’s not enough,” I said.</p>
<p>“And the most money anybody has made in one day is five hundred and
twenty-five. And that’s because somebody gave Old Blue five
hundred-dollar bills for some dang reason. The average daily net is
about thirty dollars.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t going to work.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Can you lend me some money?”</p>
<p>“I can’t do that,” he said. “If I lend you money, I have to lend
money to everybody.”</p>
<p>“What can you do?”</p>
<p>“I’ll give you fifty papers for free. But don’t tell anybody I did
it.”</p>
<p>“O.K.,” I said.</p>
<p>He gathered up the newspapers and handed them to me. I held them to
my chest. He hugged me. I carried the newspapers back toward the
water.</p>
<p>5 p.m.</p>
<p>Back on the wharf, I stood near the Bainbridge Island Terminal and
tried to sell papers to business commuters boarding the ferry.</p>
<p>I sold five in one hour, dumped the other forty-five in a garbage
can, and walked into McDonald’s, ordered four cheeseburgers for a dollar
each, and slowly ate them.</p>
<p>After eating, I walked outside and vomited on the sidewalk. I hated
to lose my food so soon after eating it. As an alcoholic Indian with a
busted stomach, I always hope I can keep enough food in me to stay
alive.</p>
<p>6 p.m.</p>
<p>With one dollar in my pocket, I walked back to Junior. He was still
passed out, and I put my ear to his chest and listened for his
heartbeat. He was alive, so I took off his shoes and socks and found one
dollar in his left sock and fifty cents in his right sock.</p>
<p>With two dollars and fifty cents in my hand, I sat beside Junior and
thought about my grandmother and her stories.</p>
<p>When I was thirteen, my grandmother told me a story about the Second
World War. She was a nurse at a military hospital in Sydney, Australia.
For two years, she healed and comforted American and Australian
soldiers.</p>
<p>One day, she tended to a wounded Maori soldier, who had lost his legs
to an artillery attack. He was very dark-skinned. His hair was black and
curly and his eyes were black and warm. His face was covered with bright
tattoos.</p>
<p>“Are you Maori?” he asked my grandmother.</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “I’m Spokane Indian. From the United States.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes,” he said. “I have heard of your tribes. But you are the
first American Indian I have ever met.”</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of Indian soldiers fighting for the United States,”
she said. “I have a brother fighting in Germany, and I lost another
brother on Okinawa.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry,” he said. “I was on Okinawa as well. It was
terrible.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry about your legs,” my grandmother said.</p>
<p>“It’s funny, isn’t it?” he said.</p>
<p>“What’s funny?”</p>
<p>“How we brown people are killing other brown people so white people
will remain free.”</p>
<p>“I hadn’t thought of it that way.”</p>
<p>“Well, sometimes I think of it that way. And other times I think of
it the way they want me to think of it. I get confused.”</p>
<p>She fed him morphine.</p>
<p>“Do you believe in Heaven?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Which Heaven?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I’m talking about the Heaven where my legs are waiting for me.”</p>
<p>They laughed.</p>
<p>“Of course,” he said, “my legs will probably run away from me when I
get to Heaven. And how will I ever catch them?”</p>
<p>“You have to get your arms strong,” my grandmother said. “So you can
run on your hands.”</p>
<p>They laughed again.</p>
<p>Sitting beside Junior, I laughed at the memory of my grandmother’s
story. I put my hand close to Junior’s mouth to make sure he was still
breathing. Yes, Junior was alive, so I took my two dollars and fifty
cents and walked to the Korean grocery store in Pioneer Square.</p>
<p>7 p.m.</p>
<p>At the Korean grocery store, I bought a fifty-cent cigar and two
scratch lottery tickets for a dollar each. The maximum cash prize was
five hundred dollars a ticket. If I won both, I would have enough money
to buy back the regalia.</p>
<p>I loved Mary, the young Korean woman who worked the register. She was
the daughter of the owners, and she sang all day.</p>
<p>“I love you,” I said when I handed her the money.</p>
<p>“You always say you love me,” she said.</p>
<p>“That’s because I will always love you.”</p>
<p>“You are a sentimental fool.”</p>
<p>“I’m a romantic old man.”</p>
<p>“Too old for me.”</p>
<p>“I know I’m too old for you, but I can dream.”</p>
<p>“O.K.,” she said. “I agree to be a part of your dreams, but I will
only hold your hand in your dreams. No kissing and no sex. Not even in
your dreams.”</p>
<p>“O.K.,” I said. “No sex. Just romance.”</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Jackson Jackson, my love. I will see you soon.”</p>
<p>I left the store, walked over to Occidental Park, sat on a bench, and
smoked my cigar all the way down.</p>
<p>Ten minutes after I finished the cigar, I scratched my first lottery
ticket and won nothing. I could only win five hundred dollars now, and
that would only be half of what I needed.</p>
<p>Ten minutes after I lost, I scratched the other ticket and won a free
ticket—a small consolation and one more chance to win some money.</p>
<p>I walked back to Mary.</p>
<p>“Jackson Jackson,” she said. “Have you come back to claim my
heart?”</p>
<p>“I won a free ticket,” I said.</p>
<p>“Just like a man,” she said. “You love money and power more than you
love me.”</p>
<p>“It’s true,” I said. “And I’m sorry it’s true.”</p>
<p>She gave me another scratch ticket, and I took it outside. I like to
scratch my tickets in private. Hopeful and sad, I scratched that third
ticket and won real money. I carried it back inside to Mary.</p>
<p>“I won a hundred dollars,” I said.</p>
<p>She examined the ticket and laughed.</p>
<p>“That’s a fortune,” she said, and counted out five twenties. Our
fingertips touched as she handed me the money. I felt electric and
constant.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said, and gave her one of the bills.</p>
<p>“I can’t take that,” she said. “It’s your money.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s tribal. It’s an Indian thing. When you win, you’re supposed
to share with your family.”</p>
<p>“I’m not your family.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you are.”</p>
<p>She smiled. She kept the money. With eighty dollars in my pocket, I
said goodbye to my dear Mary and walked out into the cold night air.</p>
<p>8 p.m.</p>
<p>I wanted to share the good news with Junior. I walked back to him,
but he was gone. I heard later that he had hitchhiked down to Portland,
Oregon, and died of exposure in an alley behind the Hilton Hotel.</p>
<p>9 p.m.</p>
<p>Lonesome for Indians, I carried my eighty dollars over to Big Heart’s
in South Downtown. Big Heart’s is an all-Indian bar. Nobody knows how or
why Indians migrate to one bar and turn it into an official Indian bar.
But Big Heart’s has been an Indian bar for twenty-three years. It used
to be way up on Aurora Avenue, but a crazy Lummi Indian burned that one
down, and the owners moved to the new location, a few blocks south of
Safeco Field.</p>
<p>I walked into Big Heart’s and counted fifteen Indians—eight men and
seven women. I didn’t know any of them, but Indians like to belong, so
we all pretended to be cousins.</p>
<p>“How much for whiskey shots?” I asked the bartender, a fat white
guy.</p>
<p>“You want the bad stuff or the badder stuff?”</p>
<p>“As bad as you got.”</p>
<p>“One dollar a shot.”</p>
<p>I laid my eighty dollars on the bar top.</p>
<p>“All right,” I said. “Me and all my cousins here are going to be
drinking eighty shots. How many is that apiece?”</p>
<p>“Counting you,” a woman shouted from behind me, “that’s five shots
for everybody.”</p>
<p>I turned to look at her. She was a chubby and pale Indian woman,
sitting with a tall and skinny Indian man.</p>
<p>“All right, math genius,” I said to her, and then shouted for the
whole bar to hear. “Five drinks for everybody!”</p>
<p>All the other Indians rushed the bar, but I sat with the
mathematician and her skinny friend. We took our time with our whiskey
shots.</p>
<p>“What’s your tribe?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m Duwamish,” she said. “And he’s Crow.”</p>
<p>“You’re a long way from Montana,” I said to him.</p>
<p>“I’m Crow,” he said. “I flew here.”</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” I asked them.</p>
<p>“I’m Irene Muse,” she said. “And this is Honey Boy.”</p>
<p>She shook my hand hard, but he offered his hand as if I was supposed
to kiss it. So I did. He giggled and blushed, as much as a dark-skinned
Crow can blush.</p>
<p>“You’re one of them two-spirits, aren’t you?” I asked him.</p>
<p>“I love women,” he said. “And I love men.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes both at the same time,” Irene said.</p>
<p>We laughed.</p>
<p>“Man,” I said to Honey Boy. “So you must have about eight or nine
spirits going on inside you, enit?”</p>
<p>“Sweetie,” he said. “I’ll be whatever you want me to be.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” Irene said. “Honey Boy is falling in love.”</p>
<p>“It has nothing to do with love,” he said.</p>
<p>We laughed.</p>
<p>“Wow,” I said. “I’m flattered, Honey Boy, but I don’t play on your
team.”</p>
<p>“Never say never,” he said.</p>
<p>“You better be careful,” Irene said. “Honey Boy knows all sorts of
magic.”</p>
<p>“Honey Boy,” I said, “you can try to seduce me, but my heart belongs
to a woman named Mary.”</p>
<p>“Is your Mary a virgin?” Honey Boy asked.</p>
<p>We laughed.</p>
<p>And we drank our whiskey shots until they were gone. But the other
Indians bought me more whiskey shots, because I’d been so generous with
my money. And Honey Boy pulled out his credit card, and I drank and
sailed on that plastic boat.</p>
<p>After a dozen shots, I asked Irene to dance. She refused. But Honey
Boy shuffled over to the jukebox, dropped in a quarter, and selected
Willie Nelson’s “Help Me Make It Through the Night.” As Irene and I sat
at the table and laughed and drank more whiskey, Honey Boy danced a slow
circle around us and sang along with Willie.</p>
<p>“Are you serenading me?” I asked him.</p>
<p>He kept singing and dancing.</p>
<p>“Are you serenading me?” I asked him again.</p>
<p>“He’s going to put a spell on you,” Irene said.</p>
<p>I leaned over the table, spilling a few drinks, and kissed Irene
hard. She kissed me back.</p>
<p>10 p.m.</p>
<p>Irene pushed me into the women’s bathroom, into a stall, shut the
door behind us, and shoved her hand down my pants. She was short, so I
had to lean over to kiss her. I grabbed and squeezed her everywhere I
could reach, and she was wonderfully fat, and every part of her body
felt like a large, warm, soft breast.</p>
<p>MIDNIGHT</p>
<p>Nearly blind with alcohol, I stood alone at the bar and swore I had
been standing in the bathroom with Irene only a minute ago.</p>
<p>“One more shot!” I yelled at the bartender.</p>
<p>“You’ve got no more money!” he yelled back.</p>
<p>“Somebody buy me a drink!” I shouted.</p>
<p>“They’ve got no more money!”</p>
<p>“Where are Irene and Honey Boy?”</p>
<p>“Long gone!”</p>
<p>2 a.m.</p>
<p>“Closing time!” the bartender shouted at the three or four Indians
who were still drinking hard after a long, hard day of drinking. Indian
alcoholics are either sprinters or marathoners.</p>
<p>“Where are Irene and Honey Boy?” I asked.</p>
<p>“They’ve been gone for hours,” the bartender said.</p>
<p>“Where’d they go?”</p>
<p>“I told you a hundred times, I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“What am I supposed to do?”</p>
<p>“It’s closing time. I don’t care where you go, but you’re not staying
here.”</p>
<p>“You are an ungrateful bastard. I’ve been good to you.”</p>
<p>“You don’t leave right now, I’m going to kick your ass.”</p>
<p>“Come on, I know how to fight.”</p>
<p>He came at me. I don’t remember what happened after that.</p>
<p>4 a.m.</p>
<p>I emerged from the blackness and discovered myself walking behind a
big warehouse. I didn’t know where I was. My face hurt. I felt my nose
and decided that it might be broken. Exhausted and cold, I pulled a
plastic tarp from a truck bed, wrapped it around me like a faithful
lover, and fell asleep in the dirt.</p>
<p>6 a.m.</p>
<p>Somebody kicked me in the ribs. I opened my eyes and looked up at a
white cop.</p>
<p>“Jackson,” the cop said. “Is that you?”</p>
<p>“Officer Williams,” I said. He was a good cop with a sweet tooth.
He’d given me hundreds of candy bars over the years. I wonder if he knew
I was diabetic.</p>
<p>“What the hell are you doing here?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I was cold and sleepy,” I said. “So I lay down.”</p>
<p>“You dumb-ass, you passed out on the railroad tracks.”</p>
<p>I sat up and looked around. I was lying on the railroad tracks.
Dockworkers stared at me. I should have been a railroad-track pizza, a
double Indian pepperoni with extra cheese. Sick and scared, I leaned
over and puked whiskey.</p>
<p>“What the hell’s wrong with you?” Officer Williams asked. “You’ve
never been this stupid.”</p>
<p>“It’s my grandmother,” I said. “She died.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, man. When did she die?”</p>
<p>“Nineteen seventy-two.”</p>
<p>“And you’re killing yourself now?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been killing myself ever since she died.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. He was sad for me. Like I said, he was a good
cop.</p>
<p>“And somebody beat the hell out of you,” he said. “You remember
who?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Grief and I went a few rounds.”</p>
<p>“It looks like Mr. Grief knocked you out.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Grief always wins.”</p>
<p>“Come on,” he said. “Let’s get you out of here.”</p>
<p>He helped me up and led me over to his squad car. He put me in the
back. “You throw up in there and you’re cleaning it up,” he said.</p>
<p>“That’s fair.”</p>
<p>He walked around the car and sat in the driver’s seat. “I’m taking
you over to detox,” he said.</p>
<p>“No, man, that place is awful,” I said. “It’s full of drunk
Indians.”</p>
<p>We laughed. He drove away from the docks.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how you guys do it,” he said.</p>
<p>“What guys?” I asked.</p>
<p>“You Indians. How the hell do you laugh so much? I just picked your
ass off the railroad tracks, and you’re making jokes. Why the hell do
you do that?”</p>
<p>“The two funniest tribes I’ve ever been around are Indians and Jews,
so I guess that says something about the inherent humor of
genocide.”</p>
<p>We laughed.</p>
<p>“Listen to you, Jackson. You’re so smart. Why the hell are you on the
street?”</p>
<p>“Give me a thousand dollars and I’ll tell you.”</p>
<p>“You bet I’d give you a thousand dollars if I knew you’d straighten
up your life.”</p>
<p>He meant it. He was the second-best cop I’d ever known.</p>
<p>“You’re a good cop,” I said.</p>
<p>“Come on, Jackson,” he said. “Don’t blow smoke up my ass.”</p>
<p>“No, really, you remind me of my grandfather.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s what you Indians always tell me.”</p>
<p>“No, man, my grandfather was a tribal cop. He was a good cop. He
never arrested people. He took care of them. Just like you.”</p>
<p>“I’ve arrested hundreds of scumbags, Jackson. And I’ve shot a couple
in the ass.”</p>
<p>“It don’t matter. You’re not a killer.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t kill them. I killed their asses. I’m an ass-killer.”</p>
<p>We drove through downtown. The missions and shelters had already
released their overnighters. Sleepy homeless men and women stood on
street corners and stared up at a gray sky. It was the morning after the
night of the living dead.</p>
<p>“Do you ever get scared?” I asked Officer Williams.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean, being a cop, is it scary?”</p>
<p>He thought about that for a while. He contemplated it. I liked that
about him.</p>
<p>“I guess I try not to think too much about being afraid,” he said.
“If you think about fear, then you’ll be afraid. The job is boring most
of the time. Just driving and looking into dark corners, you know, and
seeing nothing. But then things get heavy. You’re chasing somebody, or
fighting them or walking around a dark house, and you just know some
crazy guy is hiding around a corner, and hell, yes, it’s scary.”</p>
<p>“My grandfather was killed in the line of duty,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. How’d it happen?”</p>
<p>I knew he’d listen closely to my story.</p>
<p>“He worked on the reservation. Everybody knew everybody. It was safe.
We aren’t like those crazy Sioux or Apache or any of those other warrior
tribes. There’ve only been three murders on my reservation in the last
hundred years.”</p>
<p>“That is safe.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we Spokane, we’re passive, you know. We’re mean with words.
And we’ll cuss out anybody. But we don’t shoot people. Or stab them. Not
much, anyway.”</p>
<p>“So what happened to your grandfather?”</p>
<p>“This man and his girlfriend were fighting down by Little Falls.”</p>
<p>“Domestic dispute. Those are the worst.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but this guy was my grandfather’s brother. My
great-uncle.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was awful. My grandfather just strolled into the house.
He’d been there a thousand times. And his brother and his girlfriend
were drunk and beating on each other. And my grandfather stepped between
them, just as he’d done a hundred times before. And the girlfriend
tripped or something. She fell down and hit her head and started crying.
And my grandfather kneeled down beside her to make sure she was all
right. And for some reason my great-uncle reached down, pulled my
grandfather’s pistol out of the holster, and shot him in the head.”</p>
<p>“That’s terrible. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, my great-uncle could never figure out why he did it. He went
to prison forever, you know, and he always wrote these long letters.
Like fifty pages of tiny little handwriting. And he was always trying to
figure out why he did it. He’d write and write and write and try to
figure it out. He never did. It’s a great big mystery.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember your grandfather?”</p>
<p>“A little bit. I remember the funeral. My grandmother wouldn’t let
them bury him. My father had to drag her away from the grave.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to say.”</p>
<p>“I don’t, either.”</p>
<p>We stopped in front of the detox center.</p>
<p>“We’re here,” Officer Williams said.</p>
<p>“I can’t go in there,” I said.</p>
<p>“You have to.”</p>
<p>“Please, no. They’ll keep me for twenty-four hours. And then it will
be too late.”</p>
<p>“Too late for what?”</p>
<p>I told him about my grandmother’s regalia and the deadline for buying
it back.</p>
<p>“If it was stolen, you need to file a report,” he said. “I’ll
investigate it myself. If that thing is really your grandmother’s, I’ll
get it back for you. Legally.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “That’s not fair. The pawnbroker didn’t know it was
stolen. And, besides, I’m on a mission here. I want to be a hero, you
know? I want to win it back, like a knight.”</p>
<p>“That’s romantic crap.”</p>
<p>“That may be. But I care about it. It’s been a long time since I
really cared about something.”</p>
<p>Officer Williams turned around in his seat and stared at me. He
studied me.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you some money,” he said. “I don’t have much. Only thirty
bucks. I’m short until payday. And it’s not enough to get back the
regalia. But it’s something.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take it,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m giving it to you because I believe in what you believe. I’m
hoping, and I don’t know why I’m hoping it, but I hope you can turn
thirty bucks into a thousand somehow.”</p>
<p>“I believe in magic.”</p>
<p>“I believe you’ll take my money and get drunk on it.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you giving it to me?”</p>
<p>“There ain’t no such thing as an atheist cop.”</p>
<p>“Sure, there is.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I’m not an atheist cop.”</p>
<p>He let me out of the car, handed me two fivers and a twenty, and
shook my hand.</p>
<p>“Take care of yourself, Jackson,” he said. “Stay off the railroad
tracks.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try,” I said.</p>
<p>He drove away. Carrying my money, I headed back toward the water.</p>
<p>8 a.m.</p>
<p>On the wharf, those three Aleuts still waited on the wooden
bench.</p>
<p>“Have you seen your ship?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Seen a lot of ships,” the elder Aleut said. “But not our ship.”</p>
<p>I sat on the bench with them. We sat in silence for a long time. I
wondered if we would fossilize if we sat there long enough.</p>
<p>I thought about my grandmother. I’d never seen her dance in her
regalia. And, more than anything, I wished I’d seen her dance at a
powwow.</p>
<p>“Do you guys know any songs?” I asked the Aleuts.</p>
<p>“I know all of Hank Williams,” the elder Aleut said.</p>
<p>“How about Indian songs?”</p>
<p>“Hank Williams is Indian.”</p>
<p>“How about sacred songs?”</p>
<p>“Hank Williams is sacred.”</p>
<p>“I’m talking about ceremonial songs. You know, religious ones. The
songs you sing back home when you’re wishing and hoping.”</p>
<p>“What are you wishing and hoping for?”</p>
<p>“I’m wishing my grandmother was still alive.”</p>
<p>“Every song I know is about that.”</p>
<p>“Well, sing me as many as you can.”</p>
<p>The Aleuts sang their strange and beautiful songs. I listened. They
sang about my grandmother and about their grandmothers. They were
lonesome for the cold and the snow. I was lonesome for everything.</p>
<p>10 a.m.</p>
<p>After the Aleuts finished their last song, we sat in silence for a
while. Indians are good at silence.</p>
<p>“Was that the last song?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We sang all the ones we could,” the elder Aleut said. “The others
are just for our people.”</p>
<p>I understood. We Indians have to keep our secrets. And these Aleuts
were so secretive they didn’t refer to themselves as Indians.</p>
<p>“Are you guys hungry?” I asked.</p>
<p>They looked at one another and communicated without talking.</p>
<p>“We could eat,” the elder Aleut said.</p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p>The Aleuts and I walked over to the Big Kitchen, a greasy diner in
the International District. I knew they served homeless Indians who’d
lucked into money.</p>
<p>“Four for breakfast?” the waitress asked when we stepped inside.</p>
<p>“Yes, we’re very hungry,” the elder Aleut said.</p>
<p>She took us to a booth near the kitchen. I could smell the food
cooking. My stomach growled.</p>
<p>“You guys want separate checks?” the waitress asked.</p>
<p>“No, I’m paying,” I said.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you the generous one,” she said.</p>
<p>“Don’t do that,” I said.</p>
<p>“Do what?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask me rhetorical questions. They scare me.”</p>
<p>She looked puzzled, and then she laughed.</p>
<p>“O.K., Professor,” she said. “I’ll only ask you real questions from
now on.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“What do you guys want to eat?”</p>
<p>“That’s the best question anybody can ask anybody,” I said. “What
have you got?”</p>
<p>“How much money you got?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Another good question,” I said. “I’ve got twenty-five dollars I can
spend. Bring us all the breakfast you can, plus your tip.”</p>
<p>She knew the math.</p>
<p>“All right, that’s four specials and four coffees and fifteen per
cent for me.”</p>
<p>The Aleuts and I waited in silence. Soon enough, the waitress
returned and poured us four coffees, and we sipped at them until she
returned again, with four plates of food. Eggs, bacon, toast, hash-brown
potatoes. It’s amazing how much food you can buy for so little
money.</p>
<p>Grateful, we feasted.</p>
<p>NOON</p>
<p>I said farewell to the Aleuts and walked toward the pawnshop. I heard
later that the Aleuts had waded into the salt water near Dock 47 and
disappeared. Some Indians swore they had walked on the water and headed
north. Other Indians saw the Aleuts drown. I don’t know what happened to
them.</p>
<p>I looked for the pawnshop and couldn’t find it. I swear it wasn’t in
the place where it had been before. I walked twenty or thirty blocks
looking for the pawnshop, turned corners and bisected intersections, and
looked up its name in the phone books and asked people walking past me
if they’d ever heard of it. But that pawnshop seemed to have sailed away
like a ghost ship. I wanted to cry. And just when I’d given up, when I
turned one last corner and thought I might die if I didn’t find that
pawnshop, there it was, in a space I swear it hadn’t occupied a few
minutes ago.</p>
<p>I walked inside and greeted the pawnbroker, who looked a little
younger than he had before.</p>
<p>“It’s you,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s me,” I said.</p>
<p>“Jackson Jackson.”</p>
<p>“That is my name.”</p>
<p>“Where are your friends?”</p>
<p>“They went travelling. But it’s O.K. Indians are everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Do you have the money?”</p>
<p>“How much do you need again?” I asked, and hoped the price had
changed.</p>
<p>“Nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars.”</p>
<p>It was still the same price. Of course, it was the same price. Why
would it change?</p>
<p>“I don’t have that,” I said.</p>
<p>“What do you have?”</p>
<p>“Five dollars.”</p>
<p>I set the crumpled Lincoln on the countertop. The pawnbroker studied
it.</p>
<p>“Is that the same five dollars from yesterday?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s different.”</p>
<p>He thought about the possibilities.</p>
<p>“Did you work hard for this money?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and thought harder about the possibilities. Then
he stepped into the back room and returned with my grandmother’s
regalia.</p>
<p>“Take it,” he said, and held it out to me.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the money.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want your money.”</p>
<p>“But I wanted to win it.”</p>
<p>“You did win it. Now take it before I change my mind.”</p>
<p>Do you know how many good men live in this world? Too many to
count!</p>
<p>I took my grandmother’s regalia and walked outside. I knew that
solitary yellow bead was part of me. I knew I was that yellow bead in
part. Outside, I wrapped myself in my grandmother’s regalia and breathed
her in. I stepped off the sidewalk and into the intersection.
Pedestrians stopped. Cars stopped. The city stopped. They all watched me
dance with my grandmother. I was my grandmother, dancing.</p>
