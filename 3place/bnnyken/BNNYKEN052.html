<h4 id="the-plague-of-doves">The Plague of Doves</h4>
<p>By Louise Erdrich (2004)</p>
<p>Some years before the turn of the last century, my great-uncle, one
of the first Catholic priests of aboriginal blood, put the call out to
his congregation, telling everyone to gather at St. Gabriel’s, wearing
scapulars and holding missals. From that place, they would proceed to
walk the fields in a long, sweeping row, and with each step loudly pray
away the doves. My great-uncle’s human flock had taken up the plow and
farmed among Norwegian settlers. Unlike the French, who mingled with my
ancestors, the Norwegians took little interest in the women native to
the land and did not intermarry. In fact, they disregarded everybody but
themselves and were quite clannish. But the doves ate their crops just
the same. They ate the wheat seedlings and the rye and started on the
corn. They ate the sprouts of new flowers and the buds of apples and the
tough leaves of oak trees and even last year’s chaff. The doves were
plump, and delicious smoked, but one could wring the necks of hundreds
or even thousands and effect no visible diminishment of their number.
The pole-and-mud houses of the mixed-bloods and the skin tents of the
blanket Indians were crushed by the weight of the birds. When they
descended, both Indians and whites set up great bonfires and tried to
drive them into nets. The birds were burned, roasted, baked in pies,
stewed, salted down in barrels, or clubbed to death with sticks and left
to rot. But the dead only fed the living, and each morning when the
people woke it was to the scraping and beating of wings, the murmurous
susurration, the awful cooing babble, and the sight of the curious and
gentle faces of those creatures.</p>
<p>My great-uncle had hastily constructed crisscrossed racks of sticks
to protect the rare glass windows of what was grandly called the
rectory. In a corner of that one-room cabin, his twelve-year-old
brother, whom he had saved from a life of excessive freedom, slept on a
pallet of cottonwood branches and a mattress stuffed with grass. This
was the softest bed the boy had ever had, and he did not want to leave
it, but my great-uncle thrust a choirboy surplice at him and ordered him
to polish up the candelabra that he would carry in the procession.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>This boy would be my grandfather’s father, my Mooshum, and since he
lived to be over a hundred I was able to hear him tell and retell the
story of the most momentous day of his life—which began with this
attempt to vanquish the plague of doves. Sitting on a hard chair,
between our first television and the small alcove of bookshelves set
into the wall of our government-owned house on the Bureau of Indian
Affairs school campus, he told us how he’d heard the scratching of the
doves’ feet as they climbed all over the screens of sticks that his
brother had made. He dreaded going to the outhouse, because some of the
birds had got mired in the filth beneath the hole and set up a
screeching clamor of despair that caused others of their kind to throw
themselves against the hut in rescue attempts. But he did not dare
relieve himself anywhere else. So through a flurry of wings, shuffling
so as not to step on the birds, he made his way to the outhouse and
completed the necessary actions with his eyes shut. Leaving, he tied the
door closed so that no other doves would be trapped.</p>
<p>The outhouse drama, always the first scene in Mooshum’s story of that
momentous day, was filled with the sort of details that my brother and I
found interesting; the outhouse—which was an exotic but not unfamiliar
feature—and the horror of the birds’ death by excrement gripped our
attention. Mooshum was our second-favorite indoor entertainment.
Television was the first. But our father had removed the television’s
knobs and hidden them. Despite constant efforts, we couldn’t find the
knobs, and we came to believe that he carried them on his person at all
times. So instead we listened to our Mooshum. While he talked, we sat on
kitchen chairs and twisted our hair. Our mother had given him a red
Folgers coffee can for spitting snoose. He wore soft, worn green Sears
work clothes, a pair of battered brown lace-up boots, and a twill cap,
even in the house. His eyes shone from slits cut deep into his face. He
was hunched and dried-out, with random wisps of white hair falling over
his ears and neck. From time to time, as he spoke, we glimpsed the murky
scraggle of his teeth. Still, such was his conviction in the telling of
this story that it wasn’t hard at all to imagine him at twelve.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>My great-uncle put on his vestments, hand-me-downs from a Minneapolis
parish. Since real incense was impossible to obtain, he stuffed the
censer with dry sage rolled up in balls. Then he wet a comb at the
cabin’s iron hand pump and slicked back his hair and his little
brother’s hair. The church cabin was just across the yard, and wagons
had been pulling up for the past hour or so, each with a dog or two tied
in the box to keep the birds and their droppings off the piled hay where
people would sit. The constant movement of the birds made some of the
horses skittish. Many wore blinders and had bouquets of calming
chamomile tied to their harnesses. As our Mooshum walked across the
yard, he saw that the roof of the church was covered with birds that
repeatedly—in play, it seemed—flew up and knocked one another off the
holy cross that marked the cabin as a church. Great-Uncle was more than
six feet tall, an imposing man, whose melodious voice carried over the
confusion of sounds as he organized his parishioners into a line. The
two brothers stood at the center, and with the faithful congregants
spread out on either side they made their way slowly down the hill
toward the first of the fields they hoped to clear.</p>
<p>The sun was dull that day, thickly clouded over, and the air was
oppressively still, so that pungent clouds of sage smoke hung all around
the metal basket on its chain as it swung in each direction. In the
first field, the doves were packed so tightly on the ground that there
was a sudden agitation among the women, who could not move forward
without sweeping the birds into their skirts. In panic, the birds
tangled themselves in the cloth. The line halted suddenly as the women
erupted in a raging dance, each twirling, stamping, beating, and
flapping her skirts. So vehement was the dance that the birds all around
them popped into flight, frightening other birds, and within moments the
entire field was a storm of birds that roared and blasted down upon the
people, who nonetheless stood firm with splayed missals on their heads.
To move forward, the women forsook their modesty. They knotted their
skirts up around their thighs, held out their rosaries or scapulars, and
chanted the Hail Mary into the wind of beating wings. Mooshum, who had
rarely seen a woman’s lower limbs, dropped behind, delighted. As he
watched the women’s naked round brown legs thrash through the field, he
lowered the candelabra that his brother had given him to protect his
face. Instantly, he was struck on the forehead by a bird that hurtled
from the sky with such force that it seemed to have been flung directly
by God, to smite and blind him before he carried his sin of appreciation
any further.</p>
<p>At this point in the story, Mooshum often became so agitated that he
acted out the smiting and, to our pleasure, mimed his collapse, throwing
himself upon the floor. Then he opened his eyes and lifted his head and
stared into space, clearly seeing, even now, the vision of the Holy
Spirit, which appeared to him not in the form of a white bird among the
brown doves but as the earthly body of a girl.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Our family has something of a historical reputation for romantic
encounters. My aunt Philomena, struck by the smile of a man on a
passenger train, raised her hand from the ditch where she stood picking
berries, and was unable to see his hand wave in return. But something
made her stay there until nightfall and then camp there overnight, and
wait quietly for another whole day until the man came walking back to
her from the next stop, sixty miles ahead. My oldest cousin, Curtis,
dated the Haskell Indian Princess, who cut her braids off and gave them
to him the night she died of tuberculosis. He remained a bachelor, in
her memory, until his fifties. My aunt Agathe left the convent for a
priest. My cousin Eugene reformed a small-town stripper. Even my
sedate-looking father was swept through the Second World War by one
promising glance from my mother. And so on.</p>
<p>These tales of extravagant encounter contrasted with the modesty of
the subsequent marriages and occupations of my relatives. We are a tribe
of office workers, bank tellers, booksellers, and bureaucrats. The
wildest of us (Eugene) owns a restaurant, and the most heroic of us (my
father) teaches seventh grade. Yet this current of drama holds together
the generations, I think, and my brother and I listened to Mooshum not
only to find out what had happened but also because we hoped for
instructions on how to behave when our own moment of recognition, or
romantic trial, should arrive.</p>
<p>In truth, I thought that mine had probably already come, for even as
I sat there listening to Mooshum my fingers obsessively spelled out the
name of my beloved on my arm or in my hand or on my knee. I believed
that if I wrote his name on my body a million times he would kiss me. I
knew that he loved me, and he was safe in the knowledge that I loved
him, but we attended a Roman Catholic grade school in the early
nineteen-sixties, when boys and girls who were known to be in love
hardly talked to each other and certainly never touched. We played
softball and kickball together, and acted and spoke through other
children who were eager to deliver messages. I had copied a series of
these secondhand love statements into my tiny leopard-print diary, which
had a golden lock. The key was hidden in the hollow knob of my bedstead.
Also, I had written the name of my beloved, in blood from a scratched
mosquito bite, along the inner wall of my closet. His name held for me
the sacred resonance of those Old Testament words written in fire by an
invisible hand. Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin. I could not say his name
aloud. I could only write it with my fingers on my skin, until my mother
feared I’d got lice and coated my hair with mayonnaise, covered my head
with a shower cap, and told me to sit in a bath that was as hot as I
could stand until my condition should satisfy her.</p>
<p>I locked the bathroom door, controlled the hot water with my toe,
and, since I had nothing else to do, decided to advance my name-writing
total by several thousand. As I wrote, I found places on myself that
changed and warmed in response to the repetition of those letters, and
without an idea in the world what I was doing I gave myself successive
alphabetical orgasms so shocking in their intensity and delicacy that
the mayonnaise must have melted off my head. I then stopped writing on
myself. I believed that I had reached the million mark, and didn’t dare
try the same thing again.</p>
<p>Ash Wednesday passed, and I was reminded that I was made of dust only
and would return to dust as soon as life was done with me. My body,
inscribed everywhere with the holy name Merlin Koppin (I can say it
now), was only a temporary surface, soon to crumble like a leaf. As
always, we entered the Lenten season aware that our hunger for sweets or
salted pretzels or whatever we had given up was only a phantom craving.
The hunger of the spirit alone was real. It was my good fortune not to
understand that writing my boyfriend’s name on myself had been an impure
act, so I felt that I had nothing worse to atone for than my
collaboration with my brother’s discovery that pliers from the toolbox
worked as well as knobs on the television. As soon as my parents were
gone, we could watch “The Three Stooges”—our and Mooshum’s favorite, and
a show that my parents thought abominable. It was Palm Sunday before my
father happened to come home from an errand and rest his hand on the hot
surface of the television and then fix us with the foxlike suspicion
that his students surely dreaded. He got the truth out of us quickly.
The pliers were hidden, along with the knobs, and Mooshum’s story
resumed.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The girl who would become my great-grandmother had fallen behind the
other women in the field, because she was too shy to knot up her skirts.
Her name was Junesse, and she, too, was twelve years old. The trick, she
found, was to walk very slowly so that the birds had time to move
politely aside instead of starting upward. Junesse wore a long white
Communion dress made of layers of filmy muslin. She had insisted on
wearing this dress, and the aunt who cared for her had given in but had
promised to beat her if she returned with a rip or a stain. This threat,
too, had deterred Junesse from joining in the other women’s wild dance.
But now, finding herself alone with the felled candelabra-bearer, she
perhaps forced their fate in the world by kneeling in a patch of bird
slime to revive him, and then sealed it by using her sash to blot away
the wash of blood from his forehead, where the bird had wounded him.</p>
<p>And there she was! Mooshum paused in his story. His hands opened and
the hundreds of wrinkles in his face folded into a mask of unsurpassable
happiness. Her black hair was tied with a white ribbon. Her white dress
had a bodice embroidered with white flower petals and white leaves. And
she had the pale, heavy skin and slanting black eyes of the Métis women
in whose honor a bishop of that diocese had written a warning to his
priests, advising them to pray hard and to remember that although
women’s forms could be inordinately fair, they were also savage and
permeable. The Devil came and went in them at will. Of course, Junesse
Malaterre was innocent, but she was also sharp of mind. Her last name,
which came down to us from some French voyageur, refers to the cleft
furrows of godless rock, the barren valleys, striped outcrops, and
mazelike configurations of rose, gray, tan, and purple stone that
characterize the Badlands of North Dakota. To this place Mooshum and
Junesse eventually made their way.</p>
<p>“We seen into each udder’s dept’ ” was how my Mooshum put it, in his
gentle reservation accent. There was always a moment of silence among
the three of us as the scene played out. Mooshum saw what he described.
I don’t know what my brother saw—perhaps another boy. (He eventually
came out to everyone at my parents’ silver-anniversary dinner party.) Or
perhaps he saw that, after a whirl of experience and a minor car
accident, he, too, would settle into the dull happiness of routine with
his insurance-claims adjuster. As for me, I saw two beings—the boy
shaken, frowning, the girl in white kneeling over him pressing the sash
of her dress to the wound on his head, stanching the flow of blood. Most
important, I saw their dark, mutual gaze. The Holy Spirit hovered
between them. Her sash reddened. His blood defied gravity and flowed up
her arm. Then her mouth opened. Did they kiss? I couldn’t ask Mooshum.
She hadn’t had time to write his name on her body even once, and,
besides, she didn’t know his name. They had seen into each other’s
being, therefore names were irrelevant. They ran away together, Mooshum
said, before either had thought to ask what the other was called. And
then they decided not to have names for a while—all that mattered was
that they had escaped, slipped their knots, cut the harnesses that their
relatives had tightened. Junesse fled her aunt’s beating and the endless
drudgery of caring for six younger cousins, who would all die the
following winter of a choking cough. Mooshum fled the sanctified future
that his brother had picked out for him.</p>
<p>The two children in white clothes melted into the wall of birds.
Their robes soon became as dark as the soil, and so they blended into
the earth as they made their way along the edges of fields, through open
country, to where the farmable land stopped and the ground split open
and the beautifully abraded knobs and canyons of the Badlands began.
Although it took them several years to physically consummate their
feelings (Mooshum hinted at this but never came right out and said it),
they were in love. And they were survivors. They knew how to make a fire
from scratch, and for the first few days they were able to live on the
roasted meat of doves. It was too early in the year for there to be much
else to gather in the way of food, but they stole birds’ eggs and dug up
weeds. They snared rabbits, and begged what they could from isolated
homesteads.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>On the Monday that we braided our blessed palms in school, braces
were put on my teeth. Unlike now, when every other child undergoes some
sort of orthodonture, braces were rare then. It is really extraordinary
that my parents, in such modest circumstances, decided to correct my
teeth at all. Our dentist was old-fashioned, and believed that to
protect the enamel of my front teeth from the wires he should cap them
in gold. So one day I appeared in school with two long, resplendent
front teeth and a mouth full of hardware. It hadn’t occurred to me that
I’d be teased, but then somebody whispered, “Easter Bunny!” By noon
recess, boys swirled around me, poking, trying to get me to smile.
Suddenly, as if a great wind had blown everyone else off the bare gravel
yard, there was Merlin Koppin. He shoved me and laughed right in my
face. Then the other boys swept him away. I took refuge in the only
sheltered spot on the playground, an alcove in the brick on the southern
side facing the littered hulks of cars behind a gas station. I stood in
a silent bubble, rubbing my collarbone where his hands had pushed,
wondering. What had happened to our love? It was in danger, maybe
finished. Because of golden teeth. Even then, such a radical change in
feeling seemed impossible to bear. Remembering our family history,
though, I rallied myself to the challenge. Included in the romantic
tales were episodes of reversals. I had justice on my side, and,
besides, when my braces came off I would be beautiful. Of this I had
been assured by my parents. So as we were entering the classroom in our
usual parallel lines, me in the girls’ line, he in the boys’, I
maneuvered myself across from Merlin, punched him in the arm, hard, and
said, “Love me or leave me.” Then I marched away. My knees were weak, my
heart pounded. My act had been wild and unprecedented. Soon everyone had
heard about it, and I was famous, even among the eighth-grade girls, one
of whom, Tenny McElwayne, offered to beat Merlin up for me. Power was
mine, and it was Holy Week.</p>
<p>The statues were shrouded in purple except for our church’s
exceptionally graphic Stations of the Cross. Nowadays, the Stations of
the Cross are carved in tasteful wood or otherwise abstracted. But our
church’s version was molded of plaster and painted with bloody relish.
Eyes rolled to the whites. Mouths contorted. Limbs flailed. It was all
there. The side aisles of the church were wide, and there was plenty of
room for schoolchildren to kneel on the aggregate stone floor and
contemplate the hard truths of torture. The most sensitive of the girls,
and one boy, destined not for the priesthood but for a spectacular
musical career, wept openly and luxuriantly. The rest of us, soaked in
guilt or secretly admiring the gore, tried to sit back unobtrusively on
our bottoms and spare our kneecaps. At some point, we were allowed into
the pews, where, during the three holiest hours of the afternoon on Good
Friday, with Christ slowly dying underneath his purple cape, we were
supposed to maintain silence. During that time, I decided to begin
erasing Merlin’s name from my body by writing it backward a million
times: Nippok Nilrem. I began my task in the palm of my hand, then moved
to my knee. I’d managed only a hundred when I was thrilled to realize
that Merlin was trying frantically to catch my eye, a thing that had
never happened before. As I’ve said, our love affair had been carried
out by intermediaries. But my fierce punch seemed to have hot-wired his
emotions. That he should be so impetuous, so desperate, as to seek me
out directly! I was overcome with a wash of shyness and terror. I wanted
to acknowledge Merlin, but I couldn’t now. I stayed frozen in place
until we were dismissed.</p>
<p>Easter Sunday. I am dressed in blue dotted nylon swiss. The seams
prickle and the neck itches, but the over-all effect, I think, is
glorious. I own a hat that has fake lilies of the valley on it and a
stretchy band that digs into my chin. At the last moment, I beg to wear
my mother’s lace mantilla instead, the one like Jackie Kennedy’s,
headgear that only the most fashionable older girls wear. Nevertheless,
I am completely unprepared for what happens when I return from taking
Holy Communion. I am kneeling at the end of the pew. We are instructed
to remain silent and to allow Christ’s presence to diffuse in us. I do
my best. But then I see Merlin in the line for Communion on my side of
the church, which means that on the way back to his seat he will pass
only inches from me. I can keep my head demurely down, or I can look up.
The choice dizzies me. And I do look up. He rounds the first pew. I hold
my gaze steady. He sees that I am looking at him—freckles, dark
slicked-back hair, narrow brown eyes—and he does not look away. With the
Host of the Resurrection in his mouth, my first love gives me a glare of
anguished passion that suddenly ignites the million invisible names.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>For one whole summer, my great-grandparents lived off a bag of
contraband pinto beans. They killed the rattlesnakes that came down to
the streambed to hunt, roasted them, used salt from a little mineral
wash to season the meat. They managed to find some berry bushes and to
snare a few gophers and rabbits. But the taste of freedom was eclipsed
now by their longing for a good, hot dinner. Though desolate, the
Badlands were far from empty; they were peopled in Mooshum’s time by
unpurposed miscreants and outlaws as well as by honest ranchers. One
day, Mooshum and Junesse heard an inhuman shrieking from some bushes
deep in a draw where they’d set snares. Upon cautiously investigating,
they found that they had snared a pig by its hind leg. While they were
debating how to kill it, there appeared on a rise the silhouette of an
immense person wearing a wide fedora and seated on a horse. They could
have run, but as the rider approached them they were too amazed to move,
or didn’t want to, for the light now caught the features of a giant
woman dressed in the clothing of a man. Her eyes were small and shrewd,
her nose and cheeks pudgy, her lip a narrow curl of flesh. One long
braid hung down beside a large and motherly breast. She wore twill
trousers, boots, chaps, leather gauntlets, and a cowhide belt with
silver conchas. Her wide-brimmed hat was banded with the skin of a
snake. Her brown bloodstock horse stopped short, polite and obedient.
The woman spat a stream of tobacco juice at a quiet lizard, laughed when
it jumped and skittered, then ordered the two children to stand still
while she roped her hog. With swift and expert motions, she dismounted
and tied the pig to the pommel of her saddle, then released its hind
leg.</p>
<p>“Climb on,” she commanded, gesturing at the horse, and when the
children did she grasped the halter and started walking. The roped pig
trotted along behind. By the time they reached the woman’s ranch, which
was miles off, the two had fallen asleep. The woman had a ranch hand
take them down, still sleeping, and lay them in a bedroom in her house,
which was large and ramshackle, partly sod and partly framed. There were
two little beds in the room, plus a trundle where she herself sometimes
slept, snoring like an engine, when she was angry with her husband, the
notorious Ott Black. In this place my Mooshum and his bride-to-be would
live until they turned sixteen.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>In Erling Nicolai Rolfsrud’s compendium of memorable women and men
from North Dakota, “Mustache” Maude Black is described as not unwomanly,
though she smoked, drank, was a crack shot and a hard-assed camp boss.
These things, my Mooshum said, were all true, as was the mention of both
her kind ways and her habit of casual rustling. The last was just a
sport to her, Mooshum said; she never meant any harm by it. Mustache
Maude sometimes had a mustache, and sometimes, when she plucked it out,
she didn’t. She kept a neat henhouse and a tidy kitchen. She grew very
fond of Mooshum and Junesse, taught them to rope, ride, shoot, and make
an unbeatable chicken-and-dumpling stew. Divining their love, she
quickly banished Mooshum to the men’s bunkhouse, where he soon learned
the many ways in which he could make children in the future with
Junesse. He practiced in his mind, and could hardly wait. But Maude
forbade their marriage until both were sixteen. When that day came, she
threw a wedding supper that was talked about for years, featuring
several delectably roasted animals that seemed to be the same size and
type as those which had gone missing from the farms of the dinner
guests. This caused a stir, but Maude kept the liquor flowing, and most
of the ranchers shrugged it off.</p>
<p>What was not shrugged off, what was truly resented, was the fact that
Maude had thrown an elaborate shindig for a couple of Indians. Or
half-breeds. It didn’t matter which. These were uncertain times in North
Dakota. People’s nerves were still shot over what had happened to
Custer, and every few years there occurred a lynching. Just a few years
before, the remains of five men had been found, still strung from trees,
supposedly the victims of a vigilante party led by Flopping Bill
Cantrell. Some time later, an entire family was murdered and three
Indians were caught by a mob and hanged for maybe doing it, including a
boy named Paul Holy Track, who was only thirteen.</p>
<p>The foul murder of a woman on a farm just to the west of Maude’s
place caused the neighbors to disregard, in their need for immediate
revenge, the sudden absence of that woman’s husband and to turn their
thoughts to the nearest available Indian. There I was, Mooshum said. One
night, the yard of pounded dirt between the bunkhouse and Maude’s
sleeping quarters filled with men hoisting torches of flaring pitch.
Their howls rousted Maude from her bed. As a precaution, she had sent
Mooshum down to her kitchen cellar to sleep the night. So he knew what
happened only through the memory of his wife, for he heard nothing and
dreamed his way through the danger.</p>
<p>“Send him out to us,” they bawled, “or we will take him
ourselves.”</p>
<p>Maude stood in the doorway in her nightgown, her holster belted on, a
cocked pistol in either hand. She never liked to be woken from
sleep.</p>
<p>“I’ll shoot the first two of youse that climbs down off his horse,”
she said, then gestured to the sleepy man beside her, “and Ott Black
will plug the next!”</p>
<p>The men were very drunk and could hardly control their horses. One
fell off, and Maude shot him in the leg. He started screaming worse than
the snared pig.</p>
<p>“Which one of you boys is next?” Maude roared.</p>
<p>“Send out the goddam Indian!” they called. But the yell had less
conviction, punctuated, as it was, by the shot man’s hoarse shrieks.</p>
<p>“What Indian?”</p>
<p>“That boy!”</p>
<p>“He ain’t no Indian,” Maude said. “He’s a Jew from the land of
Galilee! One of the lost tribe of Israel!”</p>
<p>Ott Black nearly choked at his wife’s wit.</p>
<p>The men laughed nervously, and called for the boy again.</p>
<p>“I was just having fun with you,” Maude said. “Fact is, he’s Ott
Black’s trueborn son.”</p>
<p>This threw the men back in their saddles. Ott blinked, then caught on
and bellowed, “You men never knowed a woman till you knowed Maude
Black!”</p>
<p>The men fell back into the night and left their fallen would-be
lyncher kicking in the dirt and pleading to God for mercy. Maybe Maude’s
bullet had hit a nerve or a bone, for the man seemed to be in an unusual
amount of pain for just a gunshot wound to the leg. He began to rave and
foam at the mouth, so Maude tied him to his saddle and set out for the
doctor’s. He died on the way from loss of blood. Before dawn, Maude came
back, gave my great-grandparents her two best horses, and told them to
ride hard back the way they had come. Which was how they ended up on
their home reservation in time to receive their allotments, where they
farmed using government-issue seed and plows and reared their six
children, one of whom was my grandfather, and where my parents took us
every summer just after the wood ticks had settled down.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The story may have been true, for, as I have said, there really was a
Mustache Maude Black who had a husband named Ott. Only the story
changed. Sometimes Maude was the one to claim Mooshum as her son in the
story and sometimes she went on to claim that she’d had an affair with
Chief Gall. And sometimes she plugged the man in the gut. But if there
was embellishment it had to do only with facts. St. Gabriel’s Church was
named for God’s messenger, the archangel who currently serves as the
patron saint of telecommunications workers. Those doves were surely the
passenger pigeons of legend and truth, whose numbers were such that
nobody thought they could ever be wiped from the earth.</p>
<p>As Mooshum grew frailer and had trouble getting out of his chair, our
parents relaxed their television boycott. More often now, our father
fixed the magic circles of plastic onto their metal posts and twiddled
them until the picture cleared. We sometimes all watched “The Three
Stooges” together. The black-haired one looked a lot like the woman who
had saved his life, Mooshum said, nodding and pointing at the set. I
remember imagining his gnarled brown finger as the hand of a strong
young man gripping the candelabra, which, by the way, my
great-grandparents had lugged all the way down to the Badlands, where it
had come in handy for killing snakes and gophers. They had given their
only possession to Maude as a gesture of their gratitude. She had thrust
it back at them the night they escaped.</p>
<p>That tall, seven-branched silver-plated instrument, with its finish
worn down to tin in some spots, now stood in a place of honor in the
center of our dining-room table. It held beeswax tapers, which had been
lit during Easter dinner. A month later, in the little alcove on the
school playground, I kissed Merlin Koppin. Our kiss was hard,
passionate, strangely mature. Afterward, I walked home alone. I walked
very slowly. Halfway there, I stopped and stared at a piece of the
sidewalk that I’d crossed a thousand times and knew intimately. There
was a crack in it—deep, long, jagged, and dark. It was the day when the
huge old cottonwood trees shed cotton. Their heart-shaped leaves ticked
and hissed high above me. The air was filled with falling down, and the
gutters were plump with a snow of light. I had expected to feel joy, but
instead I felt a confusion of sorrow, or maybe fear, for it suddenly
seemed that my life was a hungry story and I its source and with this
kiss I had begun to deliver myself to the words.</p>
