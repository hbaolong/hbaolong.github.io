<h4 id="a-voice-in-the-night">A Voice in the Night</h4>
<p>By Steven Millhauser (2012)</p>
<p>The boy Samuel wakes in the dark. Something’s not right. Most
commentators agree that the incident takes place inside the temple,
rather than in a tent outside the temple doors, under the stars. Less
certain is whether Samuel’s bed is in the sanctuary itself, where the
Ark of the Covenant stands before a seven-branched oil lamp that is kept
burning through the night, or in an adjoining chamber. Let’s say that he
is lying in an inner chamber, close to the sanctuary, perhaps adjacent
to it. A curtained doorway leads to the chamber of Eli, the high priest
of the temple of Shiloh. We like such details, but they do not matter.
What matters is that Samuel wakes suddenly in the night. He is twelve
years old, according to Flavius Josephus, or he may be a year or two
younger. Something has startled him awake. He hears it again, clearly
this time: “Samuel!” Eli is calling his name. What’s wrong? Eli never
calls his name in the middle of the night. Did Samuel forget to close
the temple doors at sunset, did he allow one of the seven flames of the
lamp to go out? But he remembers it well: pushing shut the heavy doors
of cedar, visiting the sanctuary and replenishing the seven gold
branches with consecrated olive oil so that the flames will burn
brightly all night long. “Samuel!” He flings aside his goat’s-hair
blanket and hurries, almost runs, through the dark. He pushes through
the curtain and enters Eli’s chamber. The old man is lying on his back.
Because he is the high priest of the temple of Shiloh, his mattress on
the wooden platform is stuffed with wool, not straw. Eli’s head rests on
a pillow of goat’s hair and his long-fingered hands lie crossed on his
chest, beneath his white beard. His eyes are closed. “You called me,”
Samuel says, or perhaps his words are “Here am I; for thou calledst me.”
Eli opens his eyes. He seems a little confused, like a man roused from
sleep. “I didn’t call you,” he answers. Or perhaps, with a touch of
gruffness, since he doesn’t like being awakened in the night: “I called
not; lie down again.” Samuel turns obediently away. He walks back to his
chamber, where he lies down but doesn’t close his eyes. In his years of
attending Eli he’s come to understand a great deal about the temple and
its rules, and he tries to understand this night as well. Is it possible
that Eli called his name without knowing it? The priest is old,
sometimes he makes noises with his lips in his sleep, or mutters strange
words. But never once has he called Samuel in the night. Has Samuel had
a dream, in which a voice called out his name? Only recently he dreamed
that he was walking alone through the parted waters of the Red Sea.
Shimmering cliffs of water towered up on both sides, and as the watery
walls began to plunge down on him he woke with a cry. From outside the
walls of the temple he hears the high-pitched wail of a young sheep.
Slowly Samuel closes his eyes.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>It’s a summer night in Stratford, Connecticut, 1950. The boy, seven
years old, lies awake in his bed on the second floor, under the two
screened windows that look down on his back yard. Through the windows he
can hear the sound of summer: the chk chk chk of crickets from the
vacant lot on the other side of the back-yard hedge. For donkeys it’s
hee-haw, for roosters it’s cock-a-doodle-doo, but for crickets you have
to make up your own sound. Sometimes a car passes on the street
alongside the yard, throwing two rectangles of light across the dark
ceiling. The boy thinks the rectangles are the shapes of the open
windows under the partially raised blinds, but he isn’t sure. He’s
listening: hard. That afternoon in his Sunday-school class at the Jewish
Community Center, Mrs. Kraus read the story of the boy Samuel. In the
middle of the night a voice called out his name: “Samuel! Samuel!” He
was an attendant of the high priest and lived in the temple of Shiloh,
without his parents. When he heard his name, Samuel thought the high
priest was calling him. Three times in the night he heard his name,
three times he went to the bedside of Eli. But it was the voice of the
Lord calling him. The boy in Stratford is listening for his name in the
night. The story of Samuel has made him nervous, tense as a cat. The
slightest sound stiffens his whole body. He never thinks about the old
man with a beard on the front of his “Child’s Illustrated Old
Testament,” but now he’s wondering. What would his voice be like? His
father says God is a story that people made up to explain things they
don’t understand. When his father speaks about God to company at dinner,
his eyes grow angry and gleeful behind his glasses. But the voice in the
night is scary as witches. The voice in the night knows you’re there,
even though you’re hidden in the dark. If the voice calls your name, you
have to answer. The boy imagines the voice calling his name. It comes
from the ceiling, it comes from the walls. It’s like a terrible touch,
all over his body. He doesn’t want to hear the voice, but if he hears it
he’ll have to answer. You can’t get out of it. He pulls the covers up to
his chin and thinks of the walls of water crashing down on the
Egyptians, on their chariots and horses. Through the window screens the
crickets seem to be growing louder.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>The Author is sixty-eight years old, in good health, most of his
teeth, half his hair, not dead yet, though lately he hasn’t been
sleeping well. He’s always been a light sleeper, the slightest sound
jostles him awake, but this is different: he falls asleep with a book on
his chest, then wakes up for no damn reason and strains his neck to look
at the green glow of his digital clock, where it’s always some
soul-crushing time like 2:16 or 3:04 in the miserable morning. Hell
time, abyss time, the hour of no return. He wonders whether he should
turn on his bedside lamp, try to read a little, relax, but he knows the
act of switching on the light will wake him up even more, and besides,
there’s the problem of what to read when you wake up at two or three in
the godforsaken morning. If he reads something that interests him he’ll
excite his mind and ruin his chance for sleep, but if he reads something
that bores him he’ll become impatient, restless, and incapable of sleep.
Better to lie there and curse his fate, like a man with a broken leg
lying in a ditch. He listens to the sounds of the dark: hsssh of a
passing car, mmmm of a neighbor’s air-conditioner, skriiik of a
floorboard in the attic—a resident ghost. Things drift through your mind
at doom-time in the morning, and as he listens he thinks of the boy in
the house in Stratford, the bed by the two windows, the voice in the
night. He thinks of the boy a lot these days, sometimes with irritation,
sometimes with a fierce love that feels like sorrow. The boy tense,
whipped up, listening for a voice in the night. He feels like shouting
at the boy, driving some sense into that head of his. Oil your baseball
glove! Jump on your bike! Do chin-ups on the swing set! Make yourself
strong! But why yell at the boy? What’d he ever do to you? Better to
imagine the voice calling right here, right now: Hello, old atheist,
have I got news for you. Sorry, pal. Don’t waste your time. You
should’ve made your pitch when I was seven. Had the boy really expected
to hear his name in the night? So long ago: Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B
Riders on the radio, his father at dinner attacking McCarthy. War in
Korea, the push to Pusan. Those old stories got to you: Joseph in the
pit, the parting of the Red Sea, David soothing the soul of Saul with
his harp. In Catholic working-class Stratford, he was the only boy who
didn’t make the sign of the cross when they passed Holy Name Church on
the way to school. Girls with smudges of ash on their foreheads. His
God-scorning father driving him to Sunday school but taking him home
when the others went to Hebrew class. No bar mitzvah for him. His father
mocking his own rabbi for making boys jabber words they didn’t
understand. “Pure gibberish.” A new word: gibberish. He liked it:
gibberish. Still: Sunday school, “Rock of Ages,” the story of Samuel,
why is this night different from all other nights. The boy lying there
listening, wanting his name to be called. Had he wanted his name to be
called? Through the window the Author hears the sound of a distant car,
the cry of the crickets. Sixty years later, upstate New York, and still
the cry of the crickets in the summer in Stratford. Time to sleep, old
man.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Samuel wakes again. This time he’s sure: Eli has called his name. The
voice stands out sharply, like a name written on a wall. “Samuel!” He
throws off the goat’s-hair blanket and steps onto the straw mat on the
floor by his bed. He has lived with Eli in the temple of Shiloh for as
long as he can remember. Once a year his mother and father visit him,
when they come up from Ramah to offer the annual sacrifice. When he was
born, his mother gave him to the Lord. She had asked the Lord for a son,
and that’s why his name is Asked-of-the-Lord. That’s why he wears a
linen ephod, that’s why his hair flows down below his shoulders: no
razor shall ever come upon his head. Samuel: Asked of the Lord. He
enters Eli’s chamber, where he expects to find Eli sitting up in bed,
waiting impatiently for him. Instead, Eli is lying on his back with his
eyes closed, like a man asleep. Should he wake Eli? Did Eli call
Samuel’s name and then fall back to sleep? Samuel hesitates to wake a
man who’s old and filled with worries. Though Eli is the high priest of
the temple, his sons are wicked. They are priests who do not obey. When
flesh is offered for sacrifice, they take the best part for themselves.
They practice iniquities with women who come to the doors of the temple.
“Here am I!” Samuel says, in a voice a little louder than he intended.
Eli stirs and opens his eyes. “For thou didst call me,” Samuel says,
more softly. The old priest raises his head with difficulty. “I called
not, my son; lie down again.” Samuel doesn’t protest, but lowers his
eyes and turns away with the uneasy sense of having disturbed an old
man’s sleep. As he enters his own chamber, he tries to understand. Why
has Eli called his name twice in the night? He called out in a loud,
clear voice, a voice that could not be mistaken for some other sound.
But Eli, who speaks only truth, has denied it. Samuel lies down on his
bed and pulls the blanket up to his shoulders. Eli is very old. Does he
call out Samuel’s name and then, when Samuel appears beside him, forget
that he has called? Old men are forgetful. The other day, when Eli spoke
to Samuel of his own childhood, he could not remember a name he was
searching for and grew troubled. Samuel has seen an old man at the
temple whose body trembles like well water in a goatskin bucket. His
eyes are unlit lamps. Eli is old, his eyesight is growing dim, but his
body doesn’t tremble and his voice is still strong. On the shoulders of
his purple-and-scarlet ephod are two onyx stones, each engraved with the
names of six tribes of Israel. When he stands in sunlight, the stones
shine like fire. Slowly Samuel drifts into sleep.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>It’s the next night, and the boy in Stratford again lies awake,
listening. He doesn’t really believe he’ll hear his name, but he wants
to be awake in case it happens. He doesn’t like to miss things. If he
knows something important is coming, like a trip to the merry-go-round
and the Whip at Pleasure Beach, he’ll wait for it minute by minute, day
after day, as if by taking his attention away from it for even a second
he might cause it not to happen. But this is different. He doesn’t know
it’s going to happen. It probably won’t happen, how could it happen, but
there’s a chance, who knows. What he really needs to figure out is how
to answer, if his name is called. In the story, Samuel was told to
answer “Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.” He tries to imagine it:
“Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.” It sounds like a boy in a play.
Better to say “Yes?,” which is what he’d say if his father called his
name. But the Lord is not his father. The Lord is more powerful than his
powerful father. He’s more like the policeman in front of the school on
Barnum Avenue, with his dangerous stick hanging from his belt. Better to
say “Yes, sir,” as he’d say if the policeman called his name. If he
hears his name, that’s what he’ll say: “Yes, sir.” Don’t shout it: say
it. Yes, sir. A voice in the dark, calling his name. The thought stirs
him up again. He’s too old to be scared of the dark, but the fear still
comes on him sometimes. He likes to play a scare-game with his sister,
the way they did when he was four and she was two. She lies in her dark
room pretending to be asleep and he whispers, “Booooo haunt moan. Booooo
haunt moan.” Then they both burst into wild, scared laughter. But a
voice in the night is not funny. He’s through with witches, ghosts,
monsters, isn’t he, they’re not real, so why is he scaring himself with
the story of Samuel? It’s only a story. His father has explained it to
him: the Bible is stories. Like “Tootle” or “The Story of Dr. Dolittle.”
Trains don’t leave the tracks to chase butterflies, the pushmi-pullyu
with a head at each end isn’t an animal you’ll ever find in the zoo, and
the Lord doesn’t call your name in the night. Stories are about things
that don’t happen. They could happen, but they don’t. But they could.
What if his name was called? He would want to be there. He’d want to
know what comes next. What did the Lord say to Samuel? He can’t
remember. The most important part, and he can’t remember. That’s one
thing about him: he can’t remember the important things. He can remember
the prince climbing the hair to the top of the tower but he can’t
remember the capital of Connecticut. Is it Bridgeport? The library in
Bridgeport has long stone steps and high pillars. It’s what he first
thought of when he heard that Samuel was serving the Lord in the temple
of Shiloh. A temple is different from a church. Jews go to temple and
Christians go to church. But Catholics go to Catholic church. And
everybody goes to the library. He’s getting tired. At the backyard
hedge, Billy turned to him and said, “Do you believe in Jesus?” His eyes
were hard. There’re two answers to that question. One is “No.” The
other’s what his father said to him: “Jesus was a great teacher.” But he
was a coward and looked down. A door opens and he hears footsteps in the
hall. Do his parents know he’s lying awake, listening for his name? He
hears the door to the bathroom open and close. Sometimes his father is
up in the night. If he opens his door and waits for his father? Tell me
about Samuel. Tell me. Tell me about the voice in the night. If you
heard that voice, nothing would ever be the same. He pushes the thought
away. Tomorrow they’re going to drive out past the Sikorsky plant to
Short Beach, where he can wade out to the sandbar.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>One-fifty-four in the morning. The gods are out to get him. Sleep for
an hour, wake for no reason, stare like a madman, waiting for sleep.
Dragging himself through the day like a stepped-on snail. Won’t take a
pill, they leave him groggy. Sloggy and boggy. That all you’ve got?
Draggy and saggy. Baggy and shaggy. Like a hag, haggy. Now he’s alert,
full of useless energy. In the old days he’d recite fistfuls of sonnets.
My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun. Three things there be that
prosper up apace. Now all he can do is lie there thinking about things,
far-off things, high school, grade school, the boy in the room in
Stratford, listening for the voice in the night. Did it really happen
that way, or is he embellishing? Habit of the trade. But no, he lay
there waiting for his name. The two windows, the two bookcases his
father had made from orange crates, the bed against the other wall for
his sister to sleep in when one of the grandmothers came to stay. One
grandma from West 110th Street, one from Washington Heights. Father’s
mother, mother’s mother, first one, then the other, never together.
Waiting for the train at the Bridgeport station, with long dark benches
and the row of hand-cranked picture machines. The something-scopes.
Turning the handles, making the pictures move. The grandmother with
crooked fingers who brought packs of playing cards and dyed her hair
orange and wore lots of rattly bracelets, the grandmother with the
accent who made cold red soup with sour cream. Mutoscopes. Two women
born in the nineteenth century, who can grasp it, one in New York, one
in Minsk, before skyscrapers, before horseless carriages, before the
extinction of the dinosaurs. His own mother growing up with Russian
Jewish parents on the Lower East Side. Her father escaping the tsar,
embracing America, naming his first son Abraham, middle name Lincoln.
Moving them to a new apartment every few months, skipping out on the
rent. She said he sat reading Dostoyevsky in Russian while his sons
waited on customers in the store. The Stratford boy’s own early
childhood in Brooklyn, all there in the photo albums: pretty mother with
flower in her hair on a bench in Prospect Park, pretty mother in
wide-brimmed hat standing with little son in sailor suit on the Coney
Island boardwalk. The two of them riding the trolley. Trolley tracks in
the street, wires in the sky, the grooved wheel at the top of the
trolley pole: a forgotten world. His invisible father holding up the
light meter, adjusting the f-number, staring down into the ground-glass
screen of the twin-lens reflex. Then Stratford, working-class
neighborhood, where else can a professor afford to live. Milk delivered
in glass bottles to the back porch each morning. Italians and Eastern
Europeans, Zielski and Stoccatore and Saksa and Mancini. Riccio’s
drugstore. Ciccarelli’s lot. Ralph Politano. Tommy Pavluvcik. Mario
Recupido. What is a Jew? A Jew is someone who doesn’t cross himself in
front of Holy Name Church. A Jew is someone who stays indoors practicing
the piano on bright summer mornings while everyone else is outside
playing baseball. His mother playing Chopin nocturnes and waltzes, dee
dah-dah-dah, dee dah-dah-dah, teaching him scales, reading on the couch
with her legs tucked under her. The mahogany bookcase by the staircase,
the wall bookcase by the fireplace. His father driving them home one
night: “Did you see that? Not a book in the house!” What is a Jew? A Jew
is someone who has books in the house. His father demolishing an
argument for the existence of God, his lips twisted in scorn. Jewish
Community Center but no bar mitzvah. A tree every Christmas, a menorah
once or twice. No baby Jesuses, no Marys or mangers. A package of matzo
once a year: like big saltines. The strange word: unleavened. Dyeing
Easter eggs, walking under the roof of cornstalks and branches at
Sukkoth, biting into hollow crumbly chocolate bunnies, lighting the
yahrzeit candle for the grandmother from Minsk. What is a Jew? A Jew is
someone who thinks of Easter as a holiday celebrating rabbits. His
mother a first-grade teacher, his father a teacher at the university.
The grandmother with crooked fingers, once a piano teacher. The whole
family teaching up a storm. A tutor who tooted the flute. Tried to tutor
two tooters to toot. What is a Jew? A Jew is someone who comes from
people who teach. Erleen, from the project in Bridgeport, watching
gently over him each day when he came home from school. The rhyme in the
street: Eenie meenie miney mo, catch a nigger by the toe. His father
serious, quiet-voiced, his mouth tight: “People use that word, but not
in this house. It is disgusting.” Negro: a word of respect. Respect
people. His all-Jewish Cub Scout troop. “You don’t look for trouble,”
the Scoutmaster said. “But you don’t let anyone call you a kike.” Not in
this house. A new word: kike. He tried to imagine it: kike. Hey, kike!
Hit him, kill him. Did he really lie awake night after night, listening
for his name? The child Samuel. All about obedience. Saul’s flaw:
disobedience. Samuel thrusting his sword into the belly of the King of
the Amalekites. That’s what happens when your name is called in the
night. The righteous life, the life of moral ferocity. His father and
Samuel, two of a kind. Samuel: “Thou art wicked.” His father: “You are
ignorant.” A special sect: the Jewish atheist. The thirteenth tribe. And
you? Who are you? I am the one whose name was not called in the
night.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>The voice calls again. This time Samuel doesn’t hesitate. He swings
his legs out of bed and rushes through the dark to Eli’s side. “Here am
I,” he cries, impatient now, “for thou didst call me.” Eli is lying on
his back, his eyes closed, his hands crossed on his chest. All at once
he’s leaning up on an elbow, searching Samuel’s face. Samuel feels
aggrieved, anxious, expectant. What is happening? Something is
happening. He doesn’t know what. The long hand of the priest rests on
Samuel’s arm. Samuel suddenly understands two things: Eli did not call
his name, and Eli knows who did. Does Samuel know? He almost knows. He
knows and doesn’t dare to know. But Eli is speaking, Eli is telling him
who it is that has called his name. It is the Lord. “Go, lie down: and
it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Lord; for thy
servant heareth.” The searching look, the hand on his arm: Samuel
understands that he must ask no more questions. He returns to his bed
and lies down on his back with his eyes open. He wants to hear with both
ears. One hand is pressed against his chest. His heart is like a fist
beating against the inside of the bone. What if his name isn’t called
again? Eli said, “If he call thee.” Three times, and he failed to
answer. Should he have known? He knew, he almost knew, he was about to
know. Now he knows. What he doesn’t know is whether he will hear the
voice again. If his name is not called, he will never forgive himself.
And if his name is called? Then what? What should he say? Oh, don’t you
remember? Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. Speak, Lord; for thy
servant heareth. He remembers the first time he saw Eli, the high priest
of the temple. A powerful man, with shining gems on the shoulders of his
ephod. His legs were like tall columns of stone. His hands the size of
oil jars. Now Eli’s beard is white, he mutters in his sleep. Difficult
sons, wicked sons he cannot restrain. Calm yourself. Stop trembling.
Listen.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The third night, and the boy in his bed in Stratford still hasn’t
heard his name. He’s not really listening, is he? He thought he heard it
once, a distant call, fooling him for a second, that cat cry or whatever
it was. He no longer expects to hear anything, so why’s he still
waiting? By now there’s a spirit of stubbornness in it: he’s waited this
long, might as well wait some more. But that isn’t it. What it is, he
doesn’t believe the voice in the night will come, but his unbelief
upsets him as much as belief would, if he believed. If the voice doesn’t
come, it means he hasn’t been chosen. He likes being chosen. He was
chosen to represent his class in the school spelling bee. It’s easy to
spell, he doesn’t know how to spell words wrong, but it still feels good
to be chosen. He’s not so good on the playground, can’t kick the ball as
hard as most of them, lucky if he gets to first. He wants the voice to
call him in the night, even though it won’t happen. He doesn’t believe
those old stories, doesn’t believe the prince climbing the hair or the
thorns growing up and covering the castle, so why should he believe the
story of the voice in the night? His father doesn’t believe those
stories. His father doesn’t believe in God. But when the boy asked, his
father didn’t get the angry look, he got the serious quiet look. He said
you have to think about it yourself and make up your mind when you’re
older. The boy wonders how old is older. When is when? If he hears the
voice now, he’ll know. But he already knows. He knows he won’t hear the
voice. Why should he be chosen? He’s no Samuel. He’s a good speller. He
plays the piano with two hands, he can write a poem about George
Washington and draw a picture of a kingfisher or a red-winged blackbird.
But Samuel opens the doors to the temple when the sun comes up, Samuel
fills the lamp with oil so that it burns all night. Down below he hears
a car going by. It’s passing his yard and the vacant lot, the two bars
of light sliding across the ceiling, now it’s passing the bakery down by
the stream, he loves the bakery, smell of hot rye, the gingerbread men
and the muffins with raisins, now it’s climbing the hill, sound of tires
like the waterfall in the park earlier this summer, over the hill toward
Bridgeport. He feels old, very old, older than Eli, he wishes he were
young again, a child. He wishes he’d never heard that stupid story.
Sh-h-h. Sleep now.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Another night, another waking. Not a good sign. Death by insomnia at
sixty-eight. All Samuel’s fault, keeping everybody up when they ought to
be snoring away. The boy in Stratford battling it out at the age of
seven. By high school, no tolerance for the once-a-week churchgoers.
Priest or atheist: choose one. The move to Fairfield, the beach,
Protestant churches galore. Presbyterian, First Congregational,
Episcopalian. Roper. Warren. Kane. No Jews allowed in the beach club.
Who’d want to join a beach club? Reading the five arguments for the
existence of God and their rebuttals. The ontological argument. The
teleological argument. Walking along the beach at night, the deserted
lifeguard stands, the lights of Long Island. Challenge to a friend: Why
do you go to church? Why only on Sunday? He knew what he knew: always or
never. If the voice calls your name, your other life is over. No going
back. Short of that, sorry, please pass the ketchup. By the age of
fifteen, done with religion, like the baseball books of his childhood.
No regrets. Girls in tight skirts reaching up into lockers, girls in
tight blouses hugging books to their chests as they hip-swing down the
halls. Let me touch! Let me see! The house for sale on his friend’s
street out near the junior high. “They’ll never sell to Jews.” “Why
not?” “You know how those people are.” “How are they?” “They take over
the neighborhood.” “You’re talking to one.” “Oh, you’re not that kind of
Jew.” At age eleven, the talk with his father: “We don’t do anything in
Sunday school. Just play games and fool around. I don’t want to go
anymore.” His father taking his pipe out of his mouth, looking at him
gravely: “You don’t have to go.” He’d expected resistance, a look of
reproach. Might as well blame it all on Jehovah. Could have called his
name in the night. The boy in Stratford, listening. Something extreme in
his temperament, even then. Shy and extreme. Stubborn. You don’t call my
name, I won’t call yours. Even Steven. Dr. Dolittle and Pecos Bill
instead of Samuel and King Saul. Don’t have to go. The neighborhood goes
to church, the family stays home and reads. In high school, asking his
father whether he liked teaching. His father’s pause, his grave look,
his utter attention: “If I were a millionaire, I would pay for the
privilege of teaching.” The son knows he’s heard something important. He
is moved, he is proud of his father, he’s envious. He thinks, I want to
say that someday. They call it a calling. Samuel’s call in the night.
His father’s calling. Lying awake remembering these things. Walking in
his bathing suit, towel around his neck, to the beach in Fairfield with
his parents’ friends from the city. Janey with her long black hair and
tight white one-piece, waving her arm at the street of ranch houses:
“Suburbia.” Her voice mocking, disdainful. New York judging Connecticut.
Jews moving out of New York: abandoning the tribe. Always the connection
to the city. The four years in Brooklyn, corner of Clinton and
Joralemon, the grandmother on West 110th Street and the grandmother in
Washington Heights, mother growing up on the Lower East Side, father on
the Upper West Side. Childhood trips to the city, the stone bridges of
the Merritt Parkway. The Museum of Natural History with dinosaur
skeletons like gigantic fishbones, lunch at the Automat: the sandwiches
behind the little glass windows. Horn andandandand Hardart. Early
admission to Oberlin, but he chooses Columbia. Walking along the eighth
floor of John Jay Hall, the thrilling sound of violins and cellos behind
closed doors: the good Jewish boys practicing their instruments.
Weinstein, or was it Marinoff: “What kind of Jew are you?” A Jew from
suburbia. A nothing Jew, a secular Jew, an unjewish Jew. A Jew without a
bar mitzvah, a Jew without a bump in his nose. Later he develops the
idea of the Negative Jew. A Negative Jew is a Jew about whom another Jew
says, “You don’t look Jewish.” A Negative Jew is a Jew who says to
another Jew, “Judaism is a superstition that I reject,” and to an
anti-Semite, “I have Jewish blood.” A Negative Jew is a Jew who says, “I
don’t believe in Judaism,” while being herded into a cattle car. Hitler,
the great clarifier. His father’s German Jewish colleague,
Dr. What’s-Her-Name, one of the first women admitted to a German
university, her passion for Kant, for all things German. Stayed put till
1939. Blamed it all on the Polish Jews. “They gave us a bad name.” The
boy in Stratford, lying awake at night. Hard to remember how it was. A
game, was it? Scare yourself with witches, scare yourself with Jehovah.
A shudder of delight. All those old stories, wonderful and terrible: the
voice in the night, the parting of the Red Sea, Hansel in the cage, the
children following the piper into the mountain. “Hamlet” and “Oedipus
Rex” as pale reflections of the nightmare tales of childhood. Everything
connected: David playing the harp for Saul, the boy in Stratford
practicing the piano, the cellos and violins behind the closed doors.
The boy listening for his name, the man waiting for the rush of
inspiration. Where do you get your ideas? A voice in the night. When did
you decide to become a writer? Three thousand years ago, in the temple
of Shiloh.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel,
Samuel. Commentators disagree about the meaning of the word “stood.”
Some say that the Lord assumes a bodily presence before Samuel. Others
argue that the Lord never takes on a bodily form and that therefore the
voice has drawn closer to Samuel, so that the effect is of a person
drawing closer in the dark. In one version of this argument, the boy
hears the voice and imagines a form standing beside him. All this, the
Author thinks, can be left to the interpreters. What matters to us is
that the voice of the Lord calls Samuel’s name. After all, Eli had said,
“If he call thee.” For it was not inevitable that the voice, which had
called three times and not received an answer, would call again. Now the
boy Samuel has heard the voice a fourth time and knows who is calling
him. He doesn’t yet know why the Lord is calling him, but he knows how
to answer, for Eli has told him exactly what to say: “Speak, Lord; for
thy servant heareth.” Samuel resists, the words refuse to come, then he
says it aloud: “Speak; for thy servant heareth.” He hears his words
clearly in the dark: “Speak; for thy servant heareth.” There is no
doubt: he has said “Speak” and not “Speak, Lord,” as he was instructed
to do. Was he so frightened of uttering the sacred name? He feels a rush
of self-reproach, before commanding himself to be still and listen. He
lies motionless, alert all over his body, fiercely calm. He has served
in the temple of Shiloh ever since early childhood, but nothing has
prepared him for this moment. He does not try to imagine what the Lord
will tell him, but he readies himself to remember every word, in the
order of speaking. Eli is awake, waiting in the next chamber. Eli will
ask him what the Lord has said. Though the voice of the Lord is strong,
Samuel knows it cannot be heard by Eli, and not because Eli is too far
away to hear. The voice is for him alone. He knows this without
arrogance. And he will remember. He has a good memory, he’s proud of his
memory, though he watches over his pride so that it doesn’t become
vanity. Words read to him or heard by him remain unchanged inside him.
It has always been that way. Now the Lord speaks, and Samuel listens.
There is nothing in the world but these words. The words are harsh. The
house of Eli will be judged for its iniquity. The sons of Eli are wicked
and Eli has not restrained them. Therefore the Lord will perform against
Eli all things which he has spoken concerning his house. The sons of Eli
will die on the same day. The House of Eli will come to an end. When the
Lord departs, it is like the silence after thunder. Samuel lies awake in
the dark. It seems to him that the dark has become darker, a dark so
dark that it is like the darkness upon the face of the deep, before the
Lord moved upon the face of the waters. The words have shaken him like a
wind. He can feel Eli lying awake in his chamber, waiting for Samuel to
tell him what the Lord has said. But Samuel cannot bring himself to
leave his bed and go to Eli’s chamber. If Eli asks him, and Eli will
certainly ask him, he will speak the truth, but he does not want to
speak the truth unbidden. Samuel lies in the dark a long time, listening
for the Lord, listening for Eli, but all is silent. Has the darkness
become less dark? Can darkness be less dark and still be dark? The
darkness is growing lighter. Soon it will be time to open the temple
doors. Eli will ask what the Lord has said, and Samuel will repeat the
terrible words. Samuel understands that nothing will ever be the same.
But now, as the darkness is fading, without yet losing its quality of
darkness, he wants to lie in his bed as if he could be a child forever,
he wants to lie there as if his name had not been called in the
night.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>It’s the fourth night, and by now the boy in Stratford knows he’ll
never hear his name. Still, he’s awake, and in case he’s wrong he’s
still listening, no harm in that, though at the same time he makes fun
of himself for lying there, waiting, and for what? His name? It’s only a
story in a book. You might as well lie awake waiting for a genie to rise
up out of a lamp. And even if it isn’t only a story, why would the Lord
call his name? Samuel was an attendant of the high priest of the temple,
Samuel was already favored by the Lord. The boy in Stratford goes to the
Jewish Community Center on Sunday for two hours and skips Hebrew
lessons. He doesn’t make the sign of the cross in front of Holy Name
Church, but he looks forward to Christmas as if it’s the greatest day of
winter. No crosses or angels on his tree, no lit-up statues of Mary
blinking on the front lawn, but still, stockings, colored tree-lights,
glittery tinsel, presents piled high. Christmas: a holiday celebrating
the end of the year. Rosh Hashanah: a holiday he can’t pronounce,
celebrating something he can’t remember. The Lord, if he’s even up
there, shouldn’t call his name. And that’s fine with him. He doesn’t
want his name to be called. If your name is called, everything changes.
It would be like going to Sunday school all week long. He likes the way
things are: catching fly balls and grounders in the back yard, walking
in the hot sand at Short Beach, firecrackers on the Fourth of July,
sitting in front of the fireplace in winter reading a book while his
father grades papers at one end of the couch and his mother reads at the
other end, birthday parties, reading “The 500 Hats of Bartholomew
Cubbins” to his sister, playing double solitaire with Grandma Lena,
watching the black-and-white pictures rise into the white paper in the
developing tray in his father’s darkroom, riding slowly in the boat
through the Old Mill at Pleasure Beach. He doesn’t want to leave his
family, doesn’t want to leave his room with the two windows looking down
at the back yard, the big record-player in the living room, where he and
his sister listen to “Peter and the Wolf.” His mother looking at him one
day, touching him, her eyes shining: “Oh, my firstborn.” His father
answering all his questions with that serious look, as if nothing is
more important than those questions. What happens when you die? What is
God? What is the most important thing in the world? He doesn’t want to
leave it all for the temple of Shiloh. School starts in a few weeks,
he’s still got lots of summer left, picnics by the river, drives into
Bridgeport, the smell of hot roasted nuts in Morrow’s Nut House, the
elevator operators in their maroon jackets and white gloves in Read’s
department store, the wooden ships with rigging in the window of
Blinn’s. He’s done with Samuel, done with the voice in the night, but
now, as he feels sleep coming on, he gives a final listen, just in case,
straining his ears, holding his breath, listening for the voice that
came to Samuel in that old story that’s only a story but one he knows
he’ll never forget, no matter how hard he tries.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Again. Enough already. But hey, look on the bright side: four in the
morning, three hours of sleep instead of one. The long walk after
dinner, more than an hour, hoping to outwit insomnia. Walk for one hour,
wake up at four. Walk for two hours, wake up at five. Walk for three
hours, wake up at six. Walk for four hours, drop dead of a heart attack.
His flab-armed father’s muscular calves. Walked all over Manhattan in
his City College days, late nineteen-twenties, Harlem to the Battery. A
safe city. The boy in Stratford walking up Canaan Road to the White Walk
Market, walking to school along Franklin Avenue and Collins Street and
the street that led past Holy Name. Calves skinny as forearms. His
father walking a mile to the bus stop each morning to catch the bus to
Bridgeport, no car till the boy is in second grade: city people don’t
drive. No television till fifth grade: TV is for people who don’t read.
Last in the neighborhood. Back from Manhattan with a ten-inch box, an
Air King, set up on a table next to the piano. The feverish pleasure of
black-and-white cartoons. Czerny exercises and Farmer Al Falfa. Mozart
and Mighty Mouse. His mother playing Schumann and laughing with him at
“The Merry Mailman.” His grave father bent over the Scrooge McDuck
comic, praising the diving board in the money bin. Reading “Tootle” to
him, telling him how good the first sentence is. “Far, far to the west
of everywhere is the village of Lower Trainswitch.” Far, far to the west
of everywhere. His father said, “There are three great opening sentences
in all of literature. The first is ‘In the beginning God created the
heaven and the earth.’ The second is ‘Call me Ishmael.’ The third is
‘Far, far to the west of everywhere is the village of Lower
Trainswitch.’ ” A father who’s serious and funny: you have to watch his
face carefully. The book about the whale: he knows where it is on the
shelf, he’s held it in his hands, thinking, When I’m older. The whale,
God: when he’s older. Books, always books. Ten years old: his father
lashing out at Eisenhower. “He doesn’t open a book!” The trip to Spain
after Columbia, one-way ticket, two pieces of luggage: one for clothes,
one for books. The boy in Stratford lying awake at night because of a
story in a book. What’s a story? A demon in the night. He wants to
protect the boy, warn him before it’s too late. Don’t listen to stories!
They’ll keep you awake at night, suck out your blood, leave teeth marks
in your skin. Let him sleep! Let him live! His New York Jew parents in
working-class Stratford, with their books and their piano. The professor
who doesn’t do work with his hands. Joey’s father a machinist at the
helicopter plant, Mike’s father a carpenter who builds his own house in
the vacant lot on the other side of the hedge. Joey turning to him with
a fighting look: “Can your father make a wheel?” The old sun-browned
Italian men working in their gardens. The grapevines growing all over
Jimmy Stoccatore’s high fence, the bunches of purple grapes, heavy in
the hand. Old man Ciccarelli chasing kids out of his lot. Eenie meenie
miney mo, catch a tiger by the toe. Not in this house. The Jewish Boy
Scout troop, where he learned to tie a sheepshank but never could
identify poison sumac. His refusal to be Jesus in the Sunday-school
play. Mrs. Kraus’s shocked surprise. “But why?” “Because Jesus betrayed
the Jews.” Her confusion, fear. “I never taught you that!” His father:
“Jesus was a great teacher.” Sixty years later, awake at night, at the
mercy of memory. Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair! And the Lord
came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. The boy
in Stratford, listening. Thank you, Old Man of the Sky, for not calling
his name. Better for all concerned. He can’t really have believed it,
can he? Working himself up into a temporary blaze of half-belief, a
possibility: a ghost in the dark. Better for him to stay out of the
temple of Shiloh, better to go play in the green back yards of
Stratford, grow up in a world of family excursions and shelves of books
until the writing fever seized him and claimed him for life. A calling.
Not Samuel’s call but another. Not that way but this way. Samuel
ministering unto the Lord, his teacher-father ministering unto the
generations. And the son? What about him? Far, far to the west of
everywhere, ministering unto the Muse. Thanks, Old Sea-Parter, for
leaving me be. Tired now. Soon we’ll all sleep.</p>
