<h4 id="the-telephone-game">The Telephone Game</h4>
<p>By William Trevor (1998)</p>
<p>Since the conventional separation of the sexes on the evening before
a wedding did not appeal to Liese, Tony agreed that there should be a
party to which both sides of the wedding came instead. A party was
necessary because the formalities of the day would not allow for much of
a reunion with friends they had not seen for some time, but they did not
wish the reception to be an occasion that went on and on: they wanted to
be in Venice in time for the first dinner of their marriage. So in
Tony’s flat, already rearranged for married life, his friends and
Liese’s mixed jollily in advance, while wine flowed generously and there
was background music that was danced to, while tomorrow’s bride and
groom learned a little more about one another from what was said;
friendships here were longer than their own.</p>
<p>Tonight, there was a solemnity about Liese’s manner which softened
further the beauty of her features: her mind was on her marriage.
Smooth, pale as wheat, her hair fell to her shoulders; her light-blue
eyes were a degree less tranquil than usually they were, but when she
smiled all that tranquillity came back. “Oh Tony, you are lucky,” a
cousin who had not met Liese before remarked, and Tony said he knew it.
He was fair-haired, too, by nature insouciant and humorous, handsome in
his way.</p>
<p>In Germany, Liese’s father was a manufacturer of gloves. In England,
Tony had been looked after by an aunt ever since his parents died in the
worst air disaster of 1977—the runway collision of two jumbo jets—when
Tony was six, an only child. Nineteen years later he and Liese had met
by chance, in a bustling lunchtime restaurant, not far from Victoria
Station. “D’you think we could see each other again?” he had pleaded,
while a tubby, middle-aged waitress, bringing their coffee in that
moment, approved of his boldness and let it show. 00178 was the number
on the back of the driver’s seat in the first taxi they sat in together,
black digits on an oval of white enamel. Afterward, romantically, they
both remembered that, and the taxi driver’s conversation and the tubby
waitress.</p>
<p>Already in love, Liese was told about the tragedy in 1977, Tony about
the gloves that had been the source of livelihood in Liese’s family for
generations. Driven by love, Tony played the part required of him in
Schelesnau, asking questions about lambskin and pigskin and doeskin,
showing an interest in hand-stitching and dyeing skills and thonging.
Liese was nervous in anticipation before meeting Tony’s aunt, who was
getting on a bit now, in a small South Coast resort with a distant view
of the ferries plying back and forth to France. But Liese needn’t have
been apprehensive. “She’s lovely,” Tony’s aunt said, while in
Schelesnau—where there were Liese’s two younger sisters and a busy
family life—Tony was considered charming. In Schelesnau and in England
there was at first a faint concern that the marriage was taking on a
burden that marriage did not always have to, that would have been
avoided if Liese had chosen to marry a German or Tony an English girl:
after all, there had been enmity in two terrible wars. It was a vague
feeling, very much at odds with the sentiments of the time, and although
it hovered like some old, long-discredited ghost, it failed in the end
to gain a place in the scheme of things. What did, instead, was the
telephone game.</p>
<p>On the night before the wedding it was Tony who suggested playing it.
Afterward, he hardly knew why he did, why he had imagined that Germans
would understand the humor of the game, but of course he’d had a certain
amount to drink. For her part, Liese wished she had insisted that her
wedding party wasn’t an occasion for this kind of diversion. “Oh, Tony!”
was her single, halfhearted protest, and Tony didn’t hear it.</p>
<p>Already he had explained to Liese’s sisters—both of whom were to be
bridesmaids—that strangers were telephoned, that you won if you held a
stranger in conversation longer than anyone else could with their random
calls. The information was passed around among the bewildered Germans,
who politely wondered what was coming next.</p>
<p>“I am in engine boats,” a man who had been a classmate of Liese’s in
Fräulein Groenewold’s kindergarten was saying when the music was turned
off. “ ‘Outboards,’ you say?”</p>
<p>He, and all the others—more than thirty were still left at the
party—were asked to be silent then. A number was dialled by Tony’s best
man and the first of the strangers informed that there was a gas leak in
the street, asked to check the rooms of his house for a telltale smell,
then to return to the phone with information as to that. The next was
told that an external fuse had blown, that all electrical connections
should be unplugged or turned off to obviate danger. The next was
advised to close and lock his windows against a roving polecat.</p>
<p>“The Water Board here,” Tony said when his turn came. “We’re
extremely sorry to call you out so late. We have an emergency.”</p>
<p>Some of the German visitors were still perplexed. “So they are all
your friends?” a girl with a plait asked, in spite of what had been
said. “This is a joke with friends?”</p>
<p>Liese explained again that the people who were telephoned were just
anyone. She whispered, in case her voice should carry to Tony’s victim.
“Was? Stimmt irgendwas nicht?” her friend whispered back, and Liese said
it was all just for fun.</p>
<p>“What we would like you to do,” Tony said, “is to make your way to
the water tanks in your loft and turn off the inlet tap. This tap is
usually red, Madam, but of course the color may have worn off. What
we’re endeavoring to do is to prevent the flooding of your house.”</p>
<p>“Flooding?” the woman he spoke to repeated, her voice drowsy with
sleep. “Eh?”</p>
<p>“One of our transformer valves has failed. Dangerously high pressure
level.”</p>
<p>“I can’t go up into the lofts at this hour” came the voice again.
“It’s the middle of the night.”</p>
<p>“We’re having to ask everyone in the area, Madam. Perhaps your
husband—”</p>
<p>“I ain’t got no husband. I ain’t got no one here. I’m seventy-three
years of age. How d’you think I’d know about a tap?”</p>
<p>“We’re sorry for the inconvenience, Madam. We naturally would not ask
you to do this if it were not necessary. When a transformer valve goes
it is a vital matter. The main articulated valve may go next and then of
course it is too late. When the articulated valve goes the floodwater
could rise to sixteen feet within minutes. In which case I would advise
you to keep to the upstairs rooms.”</p>
<p>Tony put the palm of his hand over the mouthpiece. She had beetled
off to get a stepladder, he whispered, and a flashlight. He listened
again and said there was the mewing of a cat.</p>
<p>“It’ll be all right now?” another German girl leaned forward to ask
Liese, and the German who was in outboard motors, who perfectly
understood the game, gestured with a smile that it would be. The game
was amusing, he considered, but not a game to play in Schelesnau. It was
sophisticated. It was the famous English sense of humor.</p>
<p>Tony heard the shuffle of footsteps, a door closing in the distance,
and in the distance also the mewing of the cat again. Then there was
silence.</p>
<p>Tony looked round his guests, some of them, as he was, a little
drunk. He laughed, careless now of allowing the sound to pass to the
other house, since its lone occupant was presumably already in her loft.
He put the receiver down beside the directories on the narrow telephone
table, and reached out with a bottle of Sancerre to attend to a couple
of empty glasses. A friend he’d been at school with began to tell of a
time when a man in Hoxton was sent out onto the streets to see if a
stolen blue van had just been parked there. Some of the Germans said
they must be going now.</p>
<p>“Sh-h-h.” Listening again, Tony held up a hand. But there was no
sound from the other end. “She’s still aloft,” he said, and put the
receiver down beside the directories again.</p>
<p>“In Germany,” it was explained by the man in outboard motors, “we
might say this was Ärgernis.”</p>
<p>“Oh, here, too,” an English girl who did not approve of the telephone
game said. “If that means ‘harassment.’ ”</p>
<p>Those who remained left in a bunch at last, the Germans telling about
Wasservexierungsport, a practical joke involving jets of water. You put
your ten pfennigs into a slot machine to bring the lights on in a grotto
and found yourself drenched instead. “Watervexing,” the outboard-motors
man translated.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>“You could stay here, you know,” Tony said when he and Liese had
collected the glasses and the ashtrays, when everything had been washed
and dried, the cushions plumped up, a window opened to let in a stream
of cold night air.</p>
<p>“But I have yet to finish packing up my things. The morning will be
busy.”</p>
<p>They walked about the flat that soon would be their home, going from
room to room, although they knew the rooms well. Softly, the music still
played, and they danced a little in the small hall, happy to be alone
now. The day they’d met there had been an office party in the busy
lunchtime restaurant, a lot of noise, and a woman in a red-dotted dress
quarrelling with her friend at the table next to theirs. How cautious
Liese had been that day was afterward remembered, and how cautious she’d
been much later when Tony said he loved her. Remembered, too, with that
same fondness was how both of them had wanted marriage, not some
substitute, how they had wanted the binding of its demands and vows and
rigors. London was the city of their romance and it was in London—to the
discomfort and annoyance of her parents, defying all convention—that
Liese had insisted the marriage should take place.</p>
<p>While they danced, Tony noticed that his telephone receiver was still
lying beside the directories. Half an hour ago he had forgotten about
it. He reached to pick it up, bringing their dance to an end.</p>
<p>“She hasn’t put hers back,” he said.</p>
<p>Liese took the receiver from him. She listened, too, and heard the
empty sound of a connected line. “Hullo,” she said. “Hullo.”</p>
<p>“She forgot. She went to bed.”</p>
<p>“Would she forget, Tony?”</p>
<p>“Well, something like it.”</p>
<p>“Did she give a name? You have the number still?”</p>
<p>Tony shook his head. “She didn’t give a name.” He had forgotten the
number; he’d simply made it up as he dialled, he said.</p>
<p>“What did she say, Tony?”</p>
<p>“Only that she was without a husband.”</p>
<p>“Her husband was out? At this time?”</p>
<p>They had drawn away from one another. Tony turned the music off.</p>
<p>“She meant she was widowed,” he said. “She wasn’t young. Seventy, or
something like that.”</p>
<p>“This old woman goes to her loft—”</p>
<p>“Well, I mean, she said she would. More likely, she didn’t believe a
word I said.”</p>
<p>“She went to look for a stepladder and a flashlight. You told
us.”</p>
<p>“I think she said she was cold in her nightdress. More likely, she
just went back to bed. I don’t blame her.”</p>
<p>Listening again, Liese said, “I can hear the cat.”</p>
<p>But when she passed the receiver over, Tony said he couldn’t hear
anything. Nothing at all, he said.</p>
<p>“Very far away. The cat was mewing, and suddenly it stopped. Don’t
put it back!” Liese cried when Tony was about to return the receiver to
its cradle. “She is there in her loft, Tony.”</p>
<p>“Oh, honestly, I don’t think so. Why should she be? It doesn’t take
an hour and a quarter to turn a stopcock off.”</p>
<p>“What is a stopcock?”</p>
<p>“Just a way of controlling the water.”</p>
<p>The mewing of the cat came faintly to him, a single mew and then
another. Not knowing why he did so, Tony shook his head again, silently
denying this sound.</p>
<p>“She could have fallen down,” Liese said. “It would be hard to see
with her flashlight and she could have fallen down.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>For the first time in the year and a half she had known him Liese
heard a testiness in Tony’s voice. There was no point in not replacing
the receiver, he said. “Look, let’s forget it, Liese.”</p>
<p>Solemnly, but in distress, Liese gazed into the features of the man
she was to marry in just over twelve hours’ time. He smiled a familiar,
easy smile. No point, he said again, more softly. No point in going on
about this.</p>
<p>“Honestly, Liese.”</p>
<p>They had walked about, that first afternoon. He had taken her through
Green Park, then down to the river. She was in London to perfect her
English; that afternoon she should have been at another class. And it
was a quarter past five before Tony explained, untruthfully, his absence
from his desk. The next day they met again.</p>
<p>“Nothing has happened, Liese.”</p>
<p>“She could be dead.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Liese, don’t be silly.”</p>
<p>At once, having said that, Tony apologized. Of course she wasn’t
silly. That game was silly. He was sorry they’d played it tonight.</p>
<p>“But, Tony—”</p>
<p>“Of course she isn’t dead.”</p>
<p>“Why do you think you can be sure?”</p>
<p>He shook his head, meaning to indicate that he wasn’t claiming to be
sure, only that reason implied what he suggested. During the months they
were getting to know one another he had learned that Liese’s imagination
was sometimes a nuisance; she had said so herself. Purposeless and
dispensable, she said—a quirk of nature that caused her, too often, to
doubt the surface of things. Well, you could call music purposeless, he
had replied, the petal of a flower dispensable: what failed the
marketplace was often what should be treasured most. But Liese called
her quirk of nature a pest; and experiencing an instance of it for the
first time now, Tony understood.</p>
<p>“Let’s not quarrel, Liese.”</p>
<p>But the quarrel—begun already while neither noticed—spread, insidious
in the stillness that the silent telephone, once more passed from hand
to hand, seemed to inspire. Neither heard the mewing of the cat again,
and Tony said, “Look, in the morning she’ll see that receiver hanging
there and she’ll remember she forgot to put it back.”</p>
<p>“It is morning now. Tony, we could go to the police.”</p>
<p>“The police? What on earth for?”</p>
<p>“They could find out where that house is.”</p>
<p>“Oh, none of this makes sense!” And Tony, who happened just then to
be holding the telephone receiver, would again have replaced it.</p>
<p>Liese snatched it, anger flushing through her cheeks. She asked him
why he’d wanted to do that, and he shrugged and didn’t answer. He didn’t
because all this was ridiculous, because he didn’t trust himself to say
anything.</p>
<p>“The police couldn’t find out,” he said after a silence had gone on.
The police wouldn’t have a telephone number to go on. All they could
tell the police was that in a house somewhere in London there was an old
woman and a cat. All over London, Tony said, there were old women and
cats.</p>
<p>“Tony, try to remember the number.”</p>
<p>“Oh, for God’s sake! How can I remember the bloody number when I
didn’t even know it in the first place?”</p>
<p>“Well, then it will be in the computers.”</p>
<p>“What computers?”</p>
<p>“In Germany all calls go into the computers.”</p>
<p>“Look, we can’t just walk round to a police station at nearly three
o’clock in the morning to report that an old woman has gone up to her
loft. It was a harmless game, Liese.”</p>
<p>She tried to say nothing, but did not succeed. The words came anyway,
unchosen, ignoring her will.</p>
<p>“It is a horrible game. How can it not be horrible when it ends like
this?”</p>
<p>The old woman lies there, Liese heard her own voice insist. And light
comes up through the open trapdoor, and the stepladder is below. There
are the dusty boards, the water pipes. The cat’s eyes are pinpricks in
the gloom.</p>
<p>“Has she struck her head, Tony? And bones go brittle when you’re old.
I’m saying what could be true.”</p>
<p>“We have no reason whatsoever to believe any of this has
happened.”</p>
<p>“The telephone left hanging—”</p>
<p>“She did not replace the telephone because she forgot to.”</p>
<p>“You asked her to come back. You said to do what you asked and to
tell you if it was done.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes people can tell immediately that it’s a put-up thing.”</p>
<p>“Hullo! Hullo!” Liese agitatedly shouted into the receiver.
“Hullo…Please.”</p>
<p>“Liese, we have to wait until she wakes up again.”</p>
<p>“At least the cat will keep the mice away.”</p>
<p>Other people will see the lights left on. Other people will come to
the house and find the dangling telephone. Why should an old woman in
her nightclothes set a stepladder under a trapdoor? The people who come
will ask that. They’ll give the cat a plate of milk and then they’ll put
the telephone back, and one of them will climb up the ladder.</p>
<p>“I wish it had happened some other night.”</p>
<p>“Liese—”</p>
<p>“You wanted to put the receiver back. You wanted not to know. You
wanted us forever not to know, to make a darkness of it.”</p>
<p>“No, of course I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes a person doesn’t realize. A person acts in some way and
doesn’t realize.”</p>
<p>“Please,” Tony begged again and Liese felt his arms around her. Tears
for a moment smudged away the room they were in, softly he stroked her
hair. When she could speak she whispered through his murmured
consolation, repeating that she wished all this had happened sooner, not
tonight. As though some illness had struck her, she experienced a
throbbing ache, somewhere in her body, she didn’t know where. That came
from muddle and confusion was what she thought, or else from being torn
apart, as if she possessed two selves. There was not room for quarrels
between them. There had not been, there was not still. Why had it
happened tonight, why now? Imagining was Gothic castles and the fairy
tales she made up when she was in Fräulein Groenewold’s kindergarten,
and fantasies with favorite film stars later on. It became a silliness
when reality was distorted. Of course he was right.</p>
<p>“I can’t help thinking of her,” Liese whispered nonetheless. “I
cannot help it.”</p>
<p>Tony turned away, and slowly crossed to the window. He wanted to be
outside, to walk about the streets, to have a chance to think. He had
been asked to reason with Liese when she wanted her wed-ding to be in
London. A longish letter had come from Schelesnau, pleading with him to
intervene, to make her see sense. It was inconvenient for everyone; it
was an added and unnecessary expense; it was exzentrisch of her.</p>
<p>Tonight Liese had learned that Tony had been daring as a boy, that he
had walked along a ledge from one dormitory window to another, eighteen
feet above the ground. She had delighted in that—that he had not told
her himself, that he was courageous and did not boast of it. Yet
everything seemed different now.</p>
<p>“It is a feeling,” Liese said.</p>
<p>At the window, Tony stared down into the empty street. The artificial
light had not yet been extinguished and would not be for hours. Yet dawn
had already crept in, among the parked cars, the plastic sacks brought
up from basements the night before, bicycles chained to railings. What
did she mean, a feeling?</p>
<p>“Honestly, there is no reason to be upset.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Tony turned from the window. Liese’s face was tight and
nervous now, for a moment not beautiful. The air that came into the room
was refreshingly cold, and again he wanted to be walking in it, alone
somewhere. She did not love him was what she meant, she had been taken
from him. He said so, staring down into the street again, his back to
her.</p>
<p>“Oh no, I love you, Tony.”</p>
<p>All over London, sleeping now, were tomorrow’s wedding guests—her
mother and her father, her friends come all the way from Schelesnau. Her
sisters’ bridesmaids’ dresses were laid out. Flowers had been ordered,
and a beribboned car. The grass of the hotel lawns was trimmed for the
reception. In her house by the sea Tony’s aunt had ironed the clothes
she’d chosen, and Liese imagined them waiting on their hangers. The
morning flights would bring more guests from Germany. She had been
stubborn about the city of their romance. There would have been no old
woman’s sleep disturbed in Schelesnau, no ugly unintended incident. Why
did she know that the dead were carried from a house in a plain long
box, not a coffin?</p>
<p>“We are different kinds of people, Tony.”</p>
<p>“Because you are German and I am English? Is that it? That history
means something after all?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. Why did he think that? Why did he seize such a
useful cliché?</p>
<p>“We are not enemies, we are friends.” She said a little more, trying
to explain what did not seem to her to be complicated. Yet she felt she
made it so, for the response was bewilderment. And Tony said, “Remember
that office party? The quarrelling woman in red? The waitress smiling
when we went off together? 00178. Remember that?”</p>
<p>She tried to, but the images would not come as clearly as they
usually did. “Yes, I remember,” she said.</p>
<p>The doubt in their exchanges brought hesitation, was an inflection
that could not be disguised. Silences came, chasms that each time were
wider.</p>
<p>“This has to do with us, not with the past we did not know.” Liese
shook her head, firm in her emphasis.</p>
<p>Tony nodded and, saying nothing, felt the weight of patience. He
wondered about it in a silence that went on for minutes, before there
was the far-off rattle of a human voice, faint and small. He looked from
the window to where Liese had laid the receiver on the table. He watched
her move to pick it up, and saw, an instant later, the glow of relief
spreading in her face.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The wedding guests strolled on tidy hotel lawns. A photographer
fussed beneath a bright blue sky. “You are more beautiful than I ever
knew,” Tony whispered while more champagne was drunk and there was talk
in German and in English. “And I love you more.”</p>
<p>Liese smiled in the moment they had purloined, before another speech
was called for, before her father expressed his particular joy that the
union of two families brought with it today the union of two nations.
“We are two foolish people,” Tony had said when at last the telephone
receiver was replaced, after the journey to the loft had been retailed
in detail, an apology offered because carrying out the instructions had
taken so long. They had embraced, clinging to one another tightly,
gratefully delivered from their territory of unease. And the shadow of
truth that had come was lost in the euphoria.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Liese said in the next day’s sunshine. “I’m sorry I was
a nuisance.”</p>
<p>Glasses were raised to greater happiness than the happiness of the
day. Together they smiled and waved from the car when it came to take
them away. Then private at last, they let their tiredness show, each
reaching for a hand. Their thoughts were different. He had been right.
Yet again, for Tony, that conclusion repeated itself: not once in the
night had he doubted that he’d been right. And Liese wondered why it was
that passing incidents seemed more significant in people’s lives and
their relationships than the enmity or amity of nations. For a moment
she wanted to speak of that, and almost did before deciding not to.</p>
