<h4 id="the-happiest-ive-been">The Happiest I’ve Been</h4>
<p>By John Updike (1959)</p>
<p>Neil Hovey came for me wearing a good suit. He parked his father’s
blue Chrysler on the dirt ramp by our barn and got out and stood by the
open car door in a double-breasted tan gabardine suit, his hands in his
pockets and his hair combed with water, squinting up at a lightning rod
an old hurricane had knocked crooked. We were driving to Chicago, so I
had packed my good clothes and dressed in worn-out slacks and an
outgrown corduroy shirt. But Neil, though not my closest friend, was the
one I had always been most relaxed with, so I wasn’t very disturbed. My
parents and I walked out from the house, across the low stretch of lawn
that was mostly mud after the thaw that had come on Christmas Day, and
my grandmother, though I had kissed her goodbye inside the house, came
out onto the porch, stooped and rather angry-looking, her head haloed by
wild old woman’s white hair and the hand more severely afflicted by
arthritis waggling at her breast in a worried way. It was growing dark,
and my grandfather had gone to bed. “Nev-er trust the man who wears the
red necktie and parts his hair in the middle” had been his final advice
to me.</p>
<p>We had expected Neil since the middle of the afternoon. Nineteen
almost twenty, I was a college sophomore home on vacation; that fall I
had met in a fine-arts course a girl I had decided I loved, and she had
invited me to the New Year’s party her parents always gave and to stay
at her house a few days. She lived in Chicago and so did Neil now,
though he had gone to our high school. His father did something—sold
steel was my impression, a huge man opening a briefcase and saying “The
I-beams are very good this year”—that required him to be always on the
move, so that at about thirteen Neil had been left with Mrs. Hovey’s
parents. They had lived in Olinger since the town was incorporated;
indeed, old Jesse Lancaster, whose sick larynx whistled when he breathed
to us boys his shocking and uproarious thoughts on the girls that walked
by his porch all day long, had twice been burgess. Meanwhile Neil’s
father got a stationary job, in Chicago, but he let Neil stay in Olinger
until he finished high school. From Chicago to this part of Pennsylvania
was a drive of seventeen hours. In the twenty months Neil had been gone,
he had come east fairly often; he loved driving, and Olinger was the one
thing he had that was close to a childhood home. In Chicago he was
working in a garage and getting his teeth straightened by the Army so
they could draft him. The Korean War was on. He had to go back, and I
wanted to go to Chicago, so it was a happy arrangement. “You’re all
dressed up,” I accused him immediately.</p>
<p>“I’ve been saying goodbye.”</p>
<p>The knot of his necktie was low and the corners of his mouth were
rubbed with pink. Years later my mother recalled how that evening his
breath stank so strongly of beer she was frightened to let me go with
him. “Your grandfather always thought his grandfather was a very dubious
character,” she said.</p>
<p>My father and Neil put my suitcases into the trunk; they contained
all the clothes I had brought with me from school, for the girl and I
were going back to college on the train together, and I would not see my
home again until spring.</p>
<p>“Well, goodbye, boys,” my mother said. “I think you’re both very
brave.” In regard to me she meant the girl as much as the roads.</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry, Mrs. Nordholm,” Neil told her quickly. “He’ll be
safer than in his own bed. I bet he sleeps from here to Indiana.” He
looked at me with an irritating imitation of her own fond gaze. When
they shook hands goodbye it was with an equality established on the base
of my helplessness. His being so slick startled me, but you can have a
friend for years and never see how he operates with adults.</p>
<p>I embraced my mother and over her shoulder with the camera of my head
tried to take a snapshot I could keep of the house, the woods behind it
and the sunset behind them, the bench beneath the walnut tree where my
grandfather cut apples into skinless bits and fed them to himself, and
the ruts the bakery truck had made in the soft lawn that morning.</p>
<p>We started down the half mile of dirt road to the highway that, one
way, went through Olinger to the city of Alton and, the other way, led
through farmland to the Turnpike. It was luxurious after the stress of
farewell to finger a cigarette out of the pack squaring my shirt pocket.
My family knew I smoked but I didn’t do it in front of them; we were all
too sensitive to bear the awkwardness. I lit mine and held the match for
Hovey. It was a relaxed friendship. We were about the same height and
had the same degree of athletic incompetence and the same curious lack
of whatever force it was that aroused loyalty and compliance in
beautiful girls. There was his bad teeth and my skin allergy; these were
being remedied now, when they mattered less. But it seemed to me that
the most important thing—about both our friendship and our failures to
become, for all the love we felt for women, actual lovers—was that he
and I lived with grandparents. This improved both our backward and
forward vistas; we knew about the midnight coughing fits and bedside
commodes that awaited most men, and we had a sense of childhoods before
1900, when the farmer ruled the land and America faced west. We had
gained a humane dimension that made us gentle and humorous among peers
but diffident at dances and hesitant in cars. Girls hate boys’ doubts;
they amount to insults. Gentleness is for married women to appreciate.
(This is my thinking then.) A girl who has received out of nowhere a
gift worth all Africa’s ivory and Asia’s gold wants more than just
humanity to bestow it on.</p>
<p>When he came to the highway Neil turned right, toward Olinger,
instead of left, toward the Turnpike. My reaction was to twist and
assure myself through the rear window that, though a pink triangle of
sandstone stared through the bare treetops, nobody at my house could
possibly see.</p>
<p>When he was again in third gear, Neil asked, “Are you in a
hurry?”</p>
<p>“No. Not especially.”</p>
<p>“Schuman’s having his New Year’s party two days early so we can go. I
thought we’d go for a couple hours and miss the Friday-night stuff on
the Pike.” His mouth moved and closed carefully over the dull, silver,
painful braces.</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said. “I don’t care.” In everything that followed there was
this sensation of my being picked up and carried somewhere.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>It was four miles from the farm to Olinger; we entered by Buchanan
Road, driving past the tall white brick house I had lived in until I was
fifteen. My grandfather had bought it before I was born and his stocks
went bad, which had happened in the same year. The new owners had strung
colored bulbs all along the front doorframe and the edges of the porch
roof. Downtown the cardboard Santa Claus still nodded in the drugstore
window, but the loudspeaker on the undertaker’s lawn had stopped
broadcasting carols. It was quite dark now, so the arches of red and
green lights above Grand Avenue seemed miracles of lift; in daylight you
saw the bulbs were just hung from a straight cable by cords of different
lengths. Larry Schuman lived on the other side of town, the newer side.
Lights ran all the way up the front edges of his house and across the
rain gutter. The next-door neighbor had a plywood reindeer-and-sleigh
floodlit on his front lawn and a snowman of papier-mâché leaning tipsily
(his eyes were x’s) against the corner of the house. No real snow had
fallen yet that winter. The air this evening, though, hinted that harder
weather was coming.</p>
<p>The Schumans’ living room felt warm. In one corner a blue spruce
drenched with tinsel reached to the ceiling; around its pot surged a
drift of wrapping paper and ribbon and boxes, a few still containing
presents—gloves and diaries and other small properties that hadn’t yet
been absorbed into the main stream of affluence. The ornamental balls
were big as baseballs and all either crimson or indigo; the tree was so
well dressed I felt self-conscious in the same room with it, without a
coat or tie and wearing an old green shirt too short in the sleeves.
Everyone else was dressed for a party. Then Mr. Schuman stamped in
comfortingly, crushing us all into one underneath his welcome—Neil and
me and the three other boys who had shown up so far. He was dressed to
go out on the town, in a vanilla topcoat and silvery silk muffler, and
smoking a cigar with the band still on. You could see, in Mr. Schuman,
where Larry got the red hair and pale eyelashes and the self-confidence,
but what in the son was smirking and pushy was in the father shrewd and
masterful. What the one used to make you nervous the other used to put
you at ease. While Mr. was jollying us, Zoe Loessner, Larry’s probable
fiancée and the only girl at the party so far, was talking nicely to
Mrs., nodding with her entire neck and fingering her Kresge pearls and
blowing cigarette smoke through the corners of her mouth, to keep it
away from the middle-aged woman’s face. Each time Zoe spat out a plume,
the shelf of blond hair overhanging her temple lifted slightly, so
emphatic was her politeness. Mrs. Schuman beamed serenely above her fur
coat and rhinestone pocketbook. It was odd to see her dressed in the
trappings of the prosperity which usually supported her good nature
invisibly, like a firm mattress under a homely bright quilt. She was a
prime product of the country, a Pennsylvania Dutch woman, who loved
feeding her sons, and imagined that the entire world, like her life, was
going well. I never saw her not smile, except at her husband. At last
she moved him into the outdoors. He turned at the threshold and did a
trick with his knees and called in to us, “Be good and if you can’t be
good, be careful.”</p>
<p>With them out of the way, the next item was getting liquor. It was a
familiar business. Did anybody have a forged driver’s license? If not,
who would dare to make one? Larry could provide India ink. Then again,
Larry’s older brother Dale might be home and would go if it didn’t take
too much time. However, on weekends he often went straight from work to
his fiancée’s apartment and stayed until Sunday. If worst came to worst,
Larry knew an illegal place in Alton, but they really soaked you. The
problem was solved strangely. More people were arriving all the time,
and one of them, Cookie Behn, who had been held back one year and hence
was deposited in our grade, announced that last November he had become
in honest fact twenty-one. I, at least, gave Cookie my share of the
money feeling a little queasy, vice had become so handy.</p>
<p>The party was the party I had been going to all my life, beginning
with Ann Mahlon’s first Halloween party, that I attended as a hot,
lumbering, breathless, and blind Donald Duck. My mother had made the
costume, and the eyes kept slipping, and were farther apart than my
eyes, so that even when the clouds of gauze parted, it was to reveal the
frustrating depthless world seen with one eye. Ann, who because her
mother loved her so much as a child had remained somewhat childish, and
I and another boy and girl who were not involved in any romantic crisis
went down into the Schumans’ basement to play circular ping-pong. Armed
with paddles, we stood each at a side of the table and when the ball was
stroked ran around it counterclockwise, slapping the ball and laughing.
To run better the girls took off their high-heeled shoes and ruined
their stockings on the cement floor. Their faces and arms and shoulder
sections became flushed, and when either of the girls lunged forward
toward the net the stiff neckline of her semi-formal dress dropped away
and the white cups of her brassière could be glimpsed holding in fat,
and when one of them reached high her shaved armpit gleamed like a bit
of chicken skin. An earring of Ann’s flew off and the two connected
rhinestones skidded to lie near the wall, among the Schumans’ power
mower and badminton poles and empty bronze motor-oil cans twice
punctured by triangles. All these images were immediately lost in the
whirl of our running; we were dizzy before we stopped. Ann leaned on me
getting back into her shoes.</p>
<p>When we pushed the cellar door open it banged against the newel post
of the carpeted stairs going to the second floor; a third of the way up,
a couple sat discussing. The girl, Jacky Iselin, cried without
emotion—the tears and nothing else, like water flowing over wood. Some
people were in the kitchen, mixing drinks and making noise. In the
living room others danced to records: 78s then—stiff discs stacked in a
ponderous leaning cylinder on the spindle of the Schumans’ console.
Every three minutes, with a click and a crash, another dropped and the
mood abruptly changed. One moment it would be “Stay As Sweet As You
Are”: Clarence Lang with the absolute expression of an idiot standing
and rocking monotonously with June Kaufmann’s boneless sad brown hand
trapped in his and their faces, staring in the same direction, pasted
together like the facets of an idol. The music stopped; when they
parted, a big squarish dark patch stained the cheek of each. Then the
next moment it would be Goodman’s “Loch Lomond” or “Cherokee” and nobody
but Margaret Lento wanted to jitterbug. Mad, she danced by herself,
swinging her head recklessly and snapping her backside; a corner of her
skirt flipped a Christmas ball onto the rug, where it collapsed into a
hundred convex reflectors. Female shoes were scattered in innocent pairs
about the room. Some were flats, resting under the sofa shyly toed in;
others were high heels lying askew, the spike of one thrust into its
mate. Sitting alone and ignored in a great armchair, I experienced
within a warm keen dishevelment, as if there were real tears in my eyes.
Had things been less unchanged, they would have seemed less tragic. But
the girls who had stepped out of these shoes were, with few exceptions,
the ones who had attended my life’s party. The alterations were so
small: a haircut, an engagement ring, a tendency toward plumpness more
frankly confessed. While they wheeled above me I sometimes caught from
their faces an unfamiliar glint, off of a hardness I did not remember,
as if beneath their skins these girls were growing more dense. The
brutality added to the features of the boys I knew seemed a more willed
effect, more desired and so less grievous. Considering that there was a
war, surprisingly many were present—4-F or at college or simply waiting
to be called. Shortly before midnight the door rattled, and there, under
the porch light, looking forlorn and chilled in their brief athletic
jackets, stood three members of the class ahead of ours who in the old
days always tried to crash Schuman’s parties. At Olinger High they had
been sports stars, and they still stood with that well-coördinated
looseness, a look of dangling from strings. The three of them had
enrolled together at Melanchthon, a small Lutheran college on the edge
of Alton, and in this season played on the Melanchthon basketball team.
That is, two did; the third hadn’t been good enough. Schuman, out of
cowardice more than mercy, let them in, and they hid immediately in the
basement, and didn’t bother us, having brought their own bottle.</p>
<p>There was one novel awkwardness. Darryl Bechtel had married Emmy
Johnson, and the couple came. Darryl had worked in his father’s
greenhouse and had been considered dull; it was Emmy that we knew. At
first no one danced with her, and Darryl didn’t know how, but then
Schuman, perhaps as host, dared. Others followed, but Schuman had her in
his arms most often, and at midnight, when we were pretending the new
year began, he kissed her; a wave of kissing swept the room now, and
everyone struggled to kiss Emmy. Even I did. There was something about
her being married that made it extraordinary. Her cheeks burning, she
kept glancing around for rescue, but Darryl, embarrassed to see his wife
dance, had gone into old man Schuman’s den, where Neil sat brooding,
sunk in mysterious sorrow.</p>
<p>When the kissing subsided and Darryl emerged, I went in to see Neil.
He was holding his face in his hands and tapping his foot to a record
playing on Mr. Schuman’s private phonograph: Krupa’s “Dark Eyes.” The
arrangement was droning and circular and Neil had kept the record going
for hours. He loved saxophones; most of us children of that depression
vintage did. I asked him, “Do you think the traffic on the Turnpike has
died down by now?”</p>
<p>He took down the tall glass on the cabinet beside him and took a
studied swallow. From the side, his face seemed lean and somewhat blue.
“Maybe,” he said, staring at the ice cubes submerged in the ochre
liquid. “The girl in Chicago’s expecting you?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, but we can call and let her know, once we know.”</p>
<p>“You think she’ll spoil?”</p>
<p>“How do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean, won’t you be seeing her all the time after we get there?
Aren’t you going to marry her?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea. I might.”</p>
<p>“Well then you’ll have the rest of Kingdom Come to see her.” He
looked directly at me, and it was plain in the blur of his eyes that he
was sick-drunk. “The trouble with you guys that have all the luck,” he
said slowly, “is that you don’t give a damn about us that don’t have
any.” Such melodramatic rudeness, coming from Neil, surprised me, as had
his blarney with my mother hours before. In trying to evade his steady,
wounded stare, I discovered there was another person in the room: a girl
sitting with her shoes on, reading Holiday. Though she held the magazine
in front of her face, I knew from the gaudy air of her clothes and from
her unfamiliar legs that she was the girl friend Margaret Lento had
brought.</p>
<p>Margaret didn’t come from Olinger but from Riverside, a section of
Alton. She had met Larry Schuman at a summer job in a restaurant, and
for the rest of high school they had more or less gone together. Since
then, though, it had dawned on Mr. and Mrs. Schuman that even in a
democracy distinctions exist: probably welcome news to Larry. In the
cruelest and most prolonged way he could manage, he had been breaking
off with her throughout the year now nearly ended. I had been surprised
to find her at this party. Obviously she had felt shaky about attending
and had brought the friend as the only kind of protection she could
afford. The other girl was acting just like a guard.</p>
<p>There being no answer to Neil, I went into the living room, where
Margaret, insanely drunk, was throwing herself around as if wanting to
break a bone. Somewhat in time to the music she would run a few steps,
then snap her body like a whip, her chin striking her chest and her
hands flying backward, fingers fanned, as her shoulders pitched forward.
In her state her body was childishly plastic; unharmed, she would bounce
back from this jolt and begin to clap and kick and hum. Schuman stayed
away from her. Margaret was small, not more than five three, with the
smallness ripeness comes to early. She had bleached a section of her
black hair platinum, cropped her head all over, and trained the stubble
into short hyacinthine curls like those on antique statues of boys. Her
face seemed quite coarse from the front, so her profile was classical
unexpectedly. She might have been Portia. When she was not putting on
her savage, pointless dance, she was in the bathroom being sick. The
pity and the vulgarity of her exhibition made everyone who was sober
uncomfortable; our common guilt in witnessing this girl’s rites brought
us so close together in that room that it seemed never, not in all time,
could we be parted. I myself was perfectly sober. I had the impression
people only drank to stop being unhappy and I nearly always felt at
least fairly happy.</p>
<p>Luckily, Margaret was in a sick phase around one o’clock, when the
elder Schumans came home. They looked in at us briefly. It was a
pleasant joke to see in their smiles that, however corrupt and unwinking
we felt, to them we looked young and sleepy: Larry’s friends. Things
quieted after they went up the stairs. In half an hour, people began
coming out of the kitchen balancing cups of coffee. By two o’clock, four
girls stood in aprons at Mrs. Schuman’s sink, and others were padding
back and forth carrying glasses and ashtrays. Another blameless racket
pierced the clatter in the kitchen. Out on the cold grass the three
Melanchthon athletes had set up the badminton net and in the faint glow
given off by the house were playing. The bird, ascending and descending
through uneven bars of light, glimmered like a firefly. Now that the
party was dying, Neil’s apathy seemed deliberately exasperating, even
vindictive. For at least another hour, he persisted in hearing “Dark
Eyes” over and over again, holding his head and tapping his foot. The
entire scene in the den had developed a fixity that was uncanny; the
girl remained in the chair and read magazines, Holiday and Esquire, one
after another. In the meantime, cars came and went and raced their
motors out front; Schuman took Ann Mahlon home and didn’t come back; and
the athletes carried the neighbor’s artificial snowman into the center
of the street and disappeared. Somehow in the arrangements shuffled
together at the end, Neil had agreed to take Margaret and the other girl
home. Margaret convalesced in the downstairs bathroom for most of that
hour. I unlocked a little glass bookcase ornamenting a desk in the dark
dining room and removed a volume of Thackeray’s Works. It turned out to
be Volume II of “Henry Esmond.” I began it, rather than break another
book out of the set, which had been squeezed in there so long the
bindings had sort of interpenetrated.</p>
<p>Esmond was going off to war again when Neil appeared in the archway
and said, “O.K., Norseman. Let’s go to Chicago.” “Norseman” was a
variant of my name he used only when he was feeling special
affection.</p>
<p>We turned off all the lamps and left the hall bulb burning against
Larry’s return. Margaret Lento seemed chastened. Neil gave her his arm
and helped her into the back seat of his father’s car; I stood aside to
let the other girl get in with her, but Neil indicated that I should. I
supposed he realized this left only the mute den-girl to go up front
with him. She sat well over on her side, was all I noticed. Neil backed
into the street and with unusual care steered past the snowman. Our
headlights made vivid the fact that the snowman’s back was a hollow
right-angled gash; he had been built up against the corner of the
house.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>From Olinger, Riverside was diagonally across Alton. The city was
sleeping as we drove through it. Most of the stop lights were blinking
green. Among cities Alton had a bad reputation; its graft and gambling
and easy juries and bawdyhouses were supposedly notorious throughout the
Middle Atlantic states. But to me it always presented an innocent face:
row after row of houses built of a local dusty-red brick, the color of
flowerpots, each house fortified with a tiny, intimate, balustraded
porch, and nothing but the wealth of movie houses and beer signs along
its main street to suggest that its citizens loved pleasure more than
the run of mankind. Indeed, as we moved at moderate speed down these
hushed streets bordered with parked cars, a limestone church bulking at
every corner and the hooded street lamps keeping watch from above, Alton
seemed less the ultimate center of an urban region than itself a suburb
of some vast mythical metropolis, like Pandemonium or Paradise. I was
conscious of evergreen wreaths on door after door and of fanlights of
stained glass in which the house number was embedded. I was also
conscious that every block was one block farther from the Turnpike.</p>
<p>Riverside, fitted into the bends of the Schuylkill, was not so
regularly laid out. Margaret’s house was one of a short row,
composition-shingled, which we approached from the rear, down a tiny
cement alley speckled with drains. The porches were a few inches higher
than the narrow pavement. Margaret asked us if we wanted to come in for
a cup of coffee, since we were going to Chicago; Neil accepted by
getting out of the car and slamming his door. The noise filled the
alley, alarming me. I wondered at the easy social life that evidently
existed among my friends at three-thirty in the morning. Margaret did,
however, lead us in stealthily, and she turned on only the kitchen
switch. The kitchen was divided from the living room by a large sofa,
which faced into littered gloom where distant light from beyond the
alley spilled over a window sill and across the spines of a radiator. In
one corner the glass of a television set showed; the screen would seem
absurdly small now, but then it seemed disproportionately elegant. The
shabbiness everywhere would not have struck me so much if I hadn’t just
come from Schuman’s place. Neil and the other girl sat on the sofa;
Margaret held a match to a gas burner and, as the blue flame licked an
old kettle, doled instant coffee into four flowered cups.</p>
<p>By the kitchen’s solitary window, overlooking a drab Alton street,
someone who had once lived in this house had built a breakfast nook like
a luncheonette booth, a yellow table between two high-backed benches. I
sat in it and read all the words I could see: “Salt,” “Pepper,” “Have
Some Lumps,” “December,” “Mohn’s Milk Inc.—A Very Merry Christmas and
Joyous New Year—Mohn’s Milk is Safe Milk—‘Mommy, Make It Mohn’s!,’ ”
“Matches,” “Hotpoint,” “Press,” “Magee Stove Federal andandandand
Furnace Corp.,” “God Is in This House,” “Ave Maria Gratia Plena,”
“Shredded Wheat Benefits—Exciting New Pattern Kungsholm.” After serving
the two on the sofa, Margaret came to me with coffee and sat down
opposite me in the booth. Fatigue had raised two blue welts beneath her
eyes.</p>
<p>“Well,” I asked her, “did you have a good time?”</p>
<p>She smiled and glanced down and made the small sound “Ch,” vestigial
of “Jesus.” With absent-minded delicacy she stirred her coffee, lifting
and replacing the spoon without a ripple.</p>
<p>“Rather odd at the end,” I said. “Not even the host there.”</p>
<p>“He took Ann Mahlon home.”</p>
<p>“I know.” I was surprised that she did, having been sick in the
bathroom for that hour.</p>
<p>“You sound jealous,” she added.</p>
<p>“Who does? I do? I don’t.”</p>
<p>“You like her, John, don’t you?” Her using my first name and the
quality of the question did not, though we had really—not counting
parties—just met, seem forward, considering the hour and that she had
brought me coffee. There is little further to go with a girl who has
brought you coffee.</p>
<p>“Oh, I like everybody,” I told her, “and the longer I’ve known them
the more I like them, because the more they’re me. The only people I
like better are ones I’ve just met. Now Ann Mahlon I’ve known since
kindergarten. Every day her mother used to bring her to the edge of the
schoolyard for months after all the other mothers had stopped.” I wanted
to cut a figure in Margaret’s eyes, but they were too dark. Stoically
she had got on top of her weariness, but it was growing bigger under
her.</p>
<p>“Did you like her then?”</p>
<p>“I felt sorry for her being embarrassed by her mother.”</p>
<p>She asked me, “What was Larry like when he was little?”</p>
<p>“Oh, bright. Kind of mean.”</p>
<p>“Was he mean?”</p>
<p>“I’d say so. Yes. In some grade or other he and I began to play chess
together. I always won until secretly he took lessons from a man his
parents knew and read strategy books.”</p>
<p>Margaret laughed, genuinely pleased. “Then did he win?”</p>
<p>“Once. After that I really tried, and after that he decided chess was
kid stuff. Besides, he’d used me up. He’d have these runs on people
where you’d be down at his house every afternoon, then in a couple
months he’d get a new pet and that’d be that.”</p>
<p>“He’s funny,” she said. “He has a kind of cold mind. He decides on
what he wants, then he does what he has to do, you know, and nothing
anybody says can change him.”</p>
<p>“He does tend to get what he wants,” I told her guardedly, realizing
that to her this meant her. Poor bruised little girl, in her mind he was
all the time cleaving with rare cunning through his parents’ objections
straight to her.</p>
<p>My coffee was nearly gone, so I glanced toward the sofa in the other
room. Neil and the girl had sunk out of sight behind its back. Before
this it had honestly not occurred to me that they had a relationship,
but now that I saw, it seemed plausible, and, at this time of night,
good news, though it meant we would not be going to Chicago quite
yet.</p>
<p>So I talked to Margaret about Larry, and she responded, showing
really quite an acute sense of him. To me, considering the personality
of a childhood friend so seriously, as if overnight he had become a
factor in the world, seemed absurd; I couldn’t even deeply believe that
in her world he mattered much. Larry Schuman, in little more than a
year, had become nothing to me. The important thing, rather than the
subject, was the conversation itself, the quick agreements, the slow
nods, the weave of different memories; it was like one of those Panama
baskets shaped underwater around a worthless stone.</p>
<p>She offered me more coffee. When she returned with it, she sat down
not opposite but beside me, lifting me to such a pitch of gratitude and
affection that the only way I could think to express it was by not
kissing her, as if a kiss were another piece of abuse women suffered.
She said, “Cold. Cheap bastard turns the thermostat down to sixty,”
meaning her father. She drew my arm around her shoulders and folded my
hand about her bare forearm, to warm it. The back of my thumb fitted
against the curve of one breast. Her head went into the hollow where my
arm and chest joined; she was terribly small, measured against your own
body. Perhaps she weighed a hundred pounds. Her lids lowered and I
kissed her two beautiful eyebrows and then the spaces of skin between
the rough curls, some black and some bleached, that fringed her
forehead. Other than this I tried to keep as still as a bed would be. It
had grown cold. A shiver starting on the side away from her would twitch
my shoulders when I tried to repress it; she would frown and
unconsciously draw my arm tighter. No one had switched the kitchen light
off. On Margaret’s foreshortened upper lip there seemed to be two pencil
marks; the length of wrist my badly fitting sleeve exposed looked pale
and naked against the spiralling down of the smaller arm held beneath
it.</p>
<p>Outside on the street the house faced there was no motion. Only once
did a car go by—around five o’clock, with twin mufflers, the radio on,
and a boy yelling. Neil and the girl murmured together incessantly; some
of what they said I could overhear.</p>
<p>“No. Which?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t care.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t you want a boy?”</p>
<p>“I’d be happy whatever I got.”</p>
<p>“I know, but which would you rather have? Don’t men want boys?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care. You.”</p>
<p>Somewhat later, Mohn’s truck passed on the other side of the street.
The milkman, well bundled, sat behind headlights in a warm orange volume
the size of a phone booth, steering one-handed and smoking a cigar that
he set on the edge of the dashboard when, his wire carrier vibrant, he
ran out of the truck with bottles. His passing led Neil to decide the
time had come. Margaret woke up frightened of her father; we hissed our
farewells and thanks to her quickly. Neil dropped the other girl off at
her house a few blocks away; he knew where it was. Sometime during that
night I must have seen this girl’s face, but I have no memory of it. She
is always behind a magazine or in the dark or with her back turned. Neil
married her years later, I know, but after we arrived in Chicago I never
saw him again, either.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Red dawn light touched the clouds above the black slate roofs as,
with a few other cars, we drove through Alton. The moon-sized clock of a
beer billboard said ten after six. Olinger was deathly still. The air
brightened as we moved along the highway; the glowing wall of my home
hung above the woods as we rounded the long curve by the Mennonite
dairy. With a .22 I could have had a pane of my parents’ bedroom window,
and they were dreaming I was in Indiana. My grandfather would be up,
stamping around in the kitchen for my grandmother to make him breakfast,
or outside walking to see if any ice had formed on the brook. For an
instant I genuinely feared he might hail me from the peak of the barn
roof. Then trees interceded and we were safe in a landscape where no one
cared.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the Turnpike Neil did a strange thing; he stopped
the car and had me take the wheel. He had never trusted me to drive his
father’s car before; he had believed my not knowing where the crankshaft
or fuel pump was handicapped my competence to steer. But now he was
quite complacent. He hunched under an old mackinaw and leaned his head
against the metal of the window frame and soon was asleep. We crossed
the Susquehanna on a long smooth bridge below Harrisburg, then began
climbing toward the Alleghenies. In the mountains there was snow, a dry
dusting like sand that waved back and forth on the road surface. Farther
along, there had been a fresh fall that night, about two inches, and the
plows had not yet cleared all the lanes. I was passing a Sunoco truck on
a high curve when without warning the scraped section gave out and I
realized I might skid into the fence, if not over the edge. The radio
was singing “Carpets of clover, I’ll lay right at your feet,” and the
speedometer said 81. Nothing happened; the car stayed firm in the snow,
and Neil slept through the danger, his face turned skyward and his
breath struggling in his nose. It was the first time I heard a
contemporary of mine snore.</p>
<p>When we came into tunnel country, the flicker and hollow
amplification stirred Neil awake. He sat up, the mackinaw dropping to
his lap, and lit a cigarette. A second after the scratch of his match
the moment occurred of which each following moment was a slight
diminution, as we made the long irregular descent toward Pittsburgh.
There were many reasons for my feeling so happy. We were on our way. I
had seen a dawn. This far, Neil could appreciate, I had brought us
safely. Ahead, a girl waited who, if I asked, would marry me, but first
there was a long trip; many hours and towns interceded between me and
that encounter. There was the quality of the 10 a.m. sunlight as it
existed in the air ahead of the windshield, filtered by the thin
overcast, blessing irresponsibility—you felt you could slice forever
through such a cool pure element—and springing, by implying how high
these hills had become, a widespreading pride: Pennsylvania, your
state—as if you had made your life. And there was knowing that twice
since midnight a person had trusted me enough to fall asleep beside
me.</p>
