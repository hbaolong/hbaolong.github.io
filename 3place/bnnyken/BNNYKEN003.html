<h4 id="over-the-river-and-through-the-wood">Over the River and Through
the Wood</h4>
<p>By John O’Hara (1934)</p>
<p>Mr. Winfield’s hat and coat and bag were in the hall of his flat, and
when the man downstairs phoned to tell him the car was waiting, he was
all ready. He went downstairs and said hello to Robert, the giant Negro
chauffeur, and handed Robert the bag, and followed him out to the car.
For the first time he knew that he and his granddaughter were not to
make the trip alone, for there were two girls with Sheila, and she
introduced them: “Grandfather, I’d like to have you meet my friends.
This is Helen Wales, and this is Kay Farnsworth. My grandfather,
Mr. Winfield.” The names meant nothing to Mr. Winfield. What did mean
something was that he was going to have to sit on the strapontin, or
else sit outside with Robert, which was no good. Not that Robert wasn’t
all right, as chauffeurs go, but Robert was wearing a raccoon coat, and
Mr. Winfield had no raccoon coat. So it was sit outside and freeze, or
sit on the little seat inside.</p>
<p>Apparently it made no difference to Sheila. He got inside, and when
he closed the door behind him, she said, “I wonder what’s keeping
Robert?”</p>
<p>“He’s strapping my bag on that thing in the back,” said Mr. Winfield.
Sheila obviously was not pleased by the delay, but in a minute or two
they got under way, and Mr. Winfield rather admired the way Sheila
carried on her conversation with her two friends and at the same time
routed and rerouted Robert so that they were out of the city in no time.
To Mr. Winfield it was pleasant and a little like old times to have the
direction and the driving done for you. Not that he ever drove himself
any more, but when he hired a car, he always had to tell the driver just
where to turn and where to go straight. Sheila knew.</p>
<p>The girls were of an age, and the people they talked about were
referred to by first names only. Ted, Bob, Gwen, Jean, Mary, Liz.
Listening with some care, Mr. Winfield discovered that school
acquaintances and boys whom they knew slightly were mentioned by their
last names.</p>
<p>Sitting where he was, he could not watch the girls’ faces, but he
formed his opinions of the Misses Wales and Farnsworth. Miss Wales
supplied every other word when Sheila was talking. She was the smallest
of the three girls, and the peppy kind. Miss Farnsworth looked out of
the window most of the time, and said hardly anything. Mr. Winfield
could see more of her face, and he found himself asking, “I wonder if
that child really likes anybody.” Well, that was one way to be. Make the
world show you. You could get away with it, too, if you were as
attractive as Miss Farnsworth. The miles streamed by and the weather got
colder, and Mr. Winfield listened and soon understood that he was not
expected to contribute to the conversation.</p>
<p>“We stop here,” said Sheila. It was Danbury, and they came to a halt
in front of the old hotel. “Wouldn’t you like to stop here,
Grandfather?” He understood then that his daughter had told Sheila to
stop here; obediently and with no dignity he got out. When he returned
to the car, the three girls were finishing their cigarettes, and as he
climbed back in the car, he noticed how Miss Farnsworth had been looking
at him and continued to look at him, almost as though she were making a
point of not helping him—although he wanted no help. He wasn’t really an
old man, an old man. Sixty-five.</p>
<p>The interior of the car was filled with cigarette smoke, and Miss
Farnsworth asked Mr. Winfield if he’d mind opening a window. He opened
it. Then Sheila said one window didn’t make any difference; open both
windows, just long enough to let the smoke get out. “My! That air feels
good,” said Miss Wales. Then: “But what about you, Mr. Winfield? You’re
in a terrible draught there.” He replied, for the first use of his voice
thus far, that he did not mind. And at that moment the girls thought
they saw a car belonging to a boy they knew, and they were in Sheffield,
just over the Massachusetts line, before Miss Farnsworth realized that
the windows were open and creating a terrible draught. She realized it
when the robe slipped off her leg, and she asked Mr. Winfield if he
would mind closing the window. But he was unable to get the crank
started; his hands were so cold there was no strength in them. “We’ll be
there soon,” said Sheila. Nevertheless, she closed the windows, not even
acknowledging Mr. Winfield’s shamed apologies.</p>
<p>He had to be first out of the car when they arrived at the house in
Lenox, and it was then that he regretted having chosen the strapontin.
He started to get out of the car, but when his feet touched the ground,
the hard-packed frozen cinders of the driveway flew up at him. His knees
had no strength in them, and he stayed there on the ground for a second
or two, trying to smile it off. Helpful Robert—almost too helpful;
Mr. Winfield wasn’t that old—jumped out of the car and put his hands in
Mr. Winfield’s armpits. The girls were frightened, but it seemed to
Mr. Winfield that they kept looking toward the library window, as though
they were afraid Sheila’s mother would be there and blaming them for his
fall. If they only knew…</p>
<p>“You go on in, Grandfather, if you’re sure you’re all right,” said
Sheila. “I have to tell Robert about the bags.”</p>
<p>“I’m all right,” said Mr. Winfield. He went in, and hung up his coat
and hat in the clothes closet under the stairs. A telephone was there,
and in front of the telephone a yellow card of numbers frequently
called. Mr. Winfield recognized only a few of the names, but he guessed
there was an altogether different crowd of people coming up here these
days. Fifteen years make a difference, even in a place like Lenox. Yes,
it was fifteen years since he had been up here in the summertime. These
trips, these annual trips for Thanksgiving, you couldn’t tell anything
about the character of the place from these trips. You never saw anybody
but your own family and, like today, their guests.</p>
<p>He went out to the darkened hall and Ula, the maid, jumped in fright.
“Ugh. Oh. It’s you, Mr. Winfield. You like to scare me.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Ula. Glad to see you’re still holding the fort. Where’s
Mrs. Day?”</p>
<p>“Upstairs, I think…Here she is now,” said Ula.</p>
<p>His daughter came down the steps; her hand on the banister was all he
could see at first. “Is that you, Father? I thought I heard the
car.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Mary,” he said. At the foot of the stairs they went through
the travesty of a kiss that both knew so well. He leaned forward so that
his head was above her shoulder. To Ula, a good Catholic, it must have
looked like the kiss of peace. “Pax tibi,” Mr. Winfield felt like
saying, but he said, “Where have you—”</p>
<p>“Father! You’re freezing!” Mrs. Day tried very hard to keep the
vexation out of her tone.</p>
<p>“It was a cold ride,” he said. “This time of year. We had snow
flurries between Danbury and Sheffield, but the girls enjoyed it.”</p>
<p>“You go right upstairs and have a bath, and I’ll send up—what would
you like? Tea? Chocolate? Coffee?”</p>
<p>He was amused. The obvious thing would be to offer him a drink, and
it was so apparent that she was talking fast to avoid that. “I think
cocoa would be fine, but you’d better have a real drink for Sheila and
her friends.”</p>
<p>“Now, why do you take that tone, Father? You could have a drink if
you wanted it, but you’re on the wagon, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Still on it. Up there with the driver.”</p>
<p>“Well, and besides, liquor doesn’t warm you up the same way something
hot does. I’ll send up some chocolate. I’ve put you in your old room, of
course. You’ll have to share the bathroom with one of Sheila’s friends,
but that’s the best I could do. Sheila wasn’t even sure she was coming
till the very last minute.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be all right. It sounds like—I didn’t bring evening
clothes.”</p>
<p>“We’re not dressing.”</p>
<p>He went upstairs. His room, the room itself, was just about the same;
but the furniture was rearranged, his favorite chair not where he liked
it best, but it was a good house; you could tell it was being lived in,
this year, today, tomorrow. Little touches, ashtrays, flowers. It seemed
young and white, cool with a warm breath, comfortable—and absolutely
strange to him and, more especially, he to it. Whatever of the past this
house had held, it was gone now. He sat in the chair and lit a
cigarette. In a wave, in a lump, in a gust, the old thoughts came to
him. Most of the year they were in the back of his mind, but up here
Mr. Winfield held a sort of annual review of far-off, but
never-out-of-sight regrets. This house, it used to be his until Mary’s
husband bought it. A good price, and in 1921 he certainly needed the
money. He needed everything, and, today he had an income from the money
he got for this house, and that was about all. He remembered the day
Mary’s husband came to him and said, “Mr. Winfield, I hate to have to be
the one to do this, but Mary—Mary doesn’t—well, she thinks you weren’t
very nice to Mrs. Winfield. I don’t know anything about it myself, of
course, but that’s what Mary thinks. I expected, naturally, I thought
you’d come and live with us now that Mrs. Winfield has died, but—well,
the point is, I know you’ve lost a lot of money, and also I happen to
know about Mrs. Winfield’s will. So I’m prepared to make you a pretty
good offer, strictly legitimate based on current values, for the house
in Lenox. I’ll pay the delinquent taxes myself and give you a hundred
and fifty thousand dollars for the house and grounds. That ought to be
enough to pay off your debts and give you a fairly decent income. And,
uh, I happen to have a friend who knows Mr. Harding quite well. Fact, he
sees the President informally one night a week, and I know he’d be only
too glad, if you were interested…”</p>
<p>He remembered how that had tempted him. Harding might have fixed it
so he could go to London, where Enid Walter was. But even then it was
too late. Enid had gone back to London because he didn’t have the guts
to divorce his wife, and the reason he wouldn’t divorce his wife was
that he wanted to “protect” Mary, and Mary’s standing, and Mary’s
husband’s standing, and Mary’s little daughter’s standing; and now he
was “protecting” them all over again, by selling his house so that he
would not become a family charge—protecting the very same people from
the embarrassment of a poor relation. “You can have the house,” he told
Day. “It’s worth that much, but no more, and I’m grateful to you for not
offering me more. About a political job, I think I might like to go to
California this winter. I have some friends out there I haven’t seen in
years.” He had known that that was exactly what Mary and her husband
wanted, so he’d gone.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door. It was Ula with a tray. “Why two cups,
Ula?” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh. Di put two cups? So I did. I’m just so used to putting two
cups.” She had left the door open behind her, and as she arranged the
things on the marble-topped table he saw Sheila and the two girls,
standing and moving in the hall.</p>
<p>“This is your room, Farnie,” said Sheila. “You’re down this way,
Helen. Remember what I told you, Farnie. Come on, Helen.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Ula,” he said. She went out and closed the door, and he
stood for a moment, contemplating the chocolate, then poured out a cup
and drank it. It made him a little thirsty, but it was good and warming,
and Mary was right; it was better than a drink. He poured out another
cup and nibbled on a biscuit. He had an idea: Miss Farnsworth might like
some. He admired that girl. She had spunk. He bet she knew what she
wanted, or seemed to, and no matter how unimportant were the things she
wanted, they were the things she wanted, and not someone else. She could
damn well thank the Lord, too, that she was young enough to have a whack
at whatever she wanted, and not have to wait the way he had. That girl
would make up her mind about a man or a fortune or a career, and by God
she would attain whatever it was. If she found, as she surely would
find, that nothing ever was enough, she’d at least find it out in time;
and early disillusionment carried a compensatory philosophical attitude,
which in a hard girl like this one would take nothing from her charm.
Mr. Winfield felt her charm, and began regarding her as the most
interesting person he had met in many dull years. It would be fun to
talk to her, to sound her out and see how far she had progressed toward,
say, ambition or disillusionment. It would be fun to do, and it would be
just plain nice of him, as former master of this house, to invite her to
have a cup of cocoa with him. Good cocoa.</p>
<p>He made his choice between going out in the hall and knocking on her
door, and knocking on her door to the bathroom. He decided on the second
procedure because he didn’t want anyone to see him knocking on her door.
So he entered the bathroom and tapped on the door that led to her room.
“In a minute,” he thought he heard her say. But then he knew he must
have been wrong. It sounded more like “Come in.” He hated people who
knocked on doors and had to be told two or three times to come in, and
it would make a bad impression if he started the friendship that
way.</p>
<p>He opened the door, and immediately he saw how right he had been in
thinking she had said “In a minute.” For Miss Farnsworth was standing in
the middle of the room, standing there all but nude. Mr. Winfield
instantly knew that this was the end of any worth-while life he had
left. There was cold murder in the girl’s eyes, and loathing and
contempt and the promise of the thought his name forever would evoke.
She spoke to him: “Get out of here you dirty old man.”</p>
<p>He returned to his room and his chair. Slowly he took a cigarette out
of his case, and did not light it. He did everything slowly. There was
all the time in the world, too much of it, for him. He knew it would be
hours before he would begin to hate himself. For a while he would just
sit there and plan his own terror.</p>
