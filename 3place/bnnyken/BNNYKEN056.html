<h4 id="another-manhattan">Another Manhattan</h4>
<p>By Donald Antrim (2008)</p>
<p>They had lied to each other so many times, over so many years, that
deceptions between them had become commonplace, practically repertoire.
Everyone knew this about them—it wasn’t news among their friends. That
night, they had dinner reservations with Elliot and Susan, who were
accustomed to following the shifts in attitude and tone—Kate’s
theatrical sighs, for instance, in reaction to Jim’s mournful looks
across the table at her—brought on by the strain of living in an
atmosphere of worry and betrayal. It was winter, and dark, and the air
in their little apartment was dry and nauseatingly warm; and yet what
they needed, it seemed to Jim, was not to flee their home for another
night of exciting conversational pauses and sly four-way flirting. They
needed to sit down together, no matter how stuffy it got in the living
room, no matter how loudly the radiators hissed and banged, and take
turns speaking their minds. They had to talk. But first he would stop at
the florist’s on his way home from the outpatient clinic. If he walked
through the door carrying a bouquet, there was a chance that Kate might
smile.</p>
<p>There was a chance also that it wouldn’t look awkward or strange
when, at the end of the evening—he didn’t really believe that he and
Kate would be staying in—he paired with Susan for the walk through the
cold, from the restaurant to Elliot’s car. It might look, in other
words, as if he were not bothered by Kate’s whispering to another man.
(She had a way, with Elliot, of bowing her head and mumbling furiously
through the strands of hair that fell across the side of her face, so
that, in order to make out her words, Elliot was forced to stoop and
lean into the fog of her breath.) Jim’s own affair, his affair with
Susan, had been over for almost five months, long enough, he thought, as
he approached the florist’s on the corner by his and Kate’s building,
for him to begin experimenting—later that same night, if the mood was
right—with innocently putting his arm around Susan’s shoulder while she
and he and Kate and Elliot walked in two sets of two toward the parking
garage.</p>
<p>Of course, he wanted to be careful not to punish Kate, or, at least,
not to seem to punish her, for her success in adultery. Elliot made her
laugh—in a sweet way. Anyone meeting them for the first time would think
they were a new couple.</p>
<p>It was wrong to hate her.</p>
<p>He’d arrived at the florist’s. Inside, he went straight over to the
roses in their refrigerated case. Though it was a cold day, cold and
very windy, and he’d come in chilled, the short walk across the heated
space warmed him, and he could feel the frigid air hit him in the face
when he yanked open the glass door. He leaned in and peered at the
flowers. He asked the girl, “Do you have yellow roses that haven’t
already bloomed and, you know, opened?”</p>
<p>Yellow roses, signifying friendship more than eros, seemed right,
given the complex potentials of the evening.</p>
<p>“We only have these.”</p>
<p>“They’re pretty, but they’re not going to last.”</p>
<p>She was pretty as well, the girl showing him roses. Had he seen her
in here before and somehow not noticed? How old was she? Should he risk
looking into her eyes? Was she wearing a ring? What about her ass? And
what had he said to her just now? Blooming and opening meant the same
thing in relation to flowers. He’d become inarticulate in her
presence.</p>
<p>Kate, in the meantime, was upstairs in the apartment, talking on the
phone to Elliot. The call had gone on for more than five hours. Kate had
had to use all available phones: her cell phone and, before the cell,
the apartment’s two cheap cordless handsets, one in the kitchen and one
in the bedroom. “Can you hear beeping? I’ve got to switch phones. Hang
on,” she’d exclaimed when the kitchen phone’s battery began dying.
Carrying that phone (her first of the call), she’d gone into the
bedroom, picked up its brother from the night table, and said, into this
new phone, “Are you there? Can you hear me? Hold on while I hang up the
other phone,” after which she’d taken both phones to the kitchen and
dropped the dead one into its cradle on the wall. A small cabinet door
beside this phone opened onto a narrow and dark airshaft that had once
housed a dumbwaiter. Kate opened and closed this empty cabinet several
times while explaining, on the bedroom phone, why Elliot’s being married
and her being married shouldn’t necessarily be considered something they
had in common. That they were both childless could stand as an area of
emotional parity, she felt, considering the fact that they both remained
unsure as to whether to have children, while their spouses frequently
made it clear that, in their opinions—Susan’s specifically regarding
Elliot, Jim’s specifically regarding Kate, and neither Susan nor Jim
meaning to suggest a marital reconfiguration—they’d make “a great dad”
or “a great mom.”</p>
<p>Elliot interrupted: “Don’t you get tired of hearing that?”</p>
<p>“It’s beside the point,” Kate answered, and went on, “Oh, Elliot, why
is talking to you so damn fucking difficult?”</p>
<p>“Do you need an answer?”</p>
<p>“You know me, always curious.” How stupid was that? She’d been
trying, not for the first time, to lovingly make clear to Elliot why she
could no longer sleep with him. During the first hours of the
conversation she’d been able to control the impulse to bait and flirt.
But the business of swapping phones, the walking from room to room in
the stuffy apartment, had, as it were, weakened her. It was as if, in
losing that first phone, she’d lost a line of defense, however symbolic,
against Elliot’s desire. Or maybe, she thought as she stood in the
kitchen, opening and closing the dumbwaiter door with one hand, the
necessary act of sacrificing one phone for another could be read as a
veiled enactment of the sort of ambivalence required for alternating
between lovers in the first place. Or was that too absurd?</p>
<p>“Say that once more. I didn’t hear what you were saying,” she said to
Elliot. The heating pipes banged; day was turning to dusk. She listened
to the hiss of steam escaping from the radiator beneath the kitchen
window. Elliot began again, “I was saying that I sometimes think that
you think that because I’m a psychiatrist I can automatically see all
the different sides of a situation. But I’m not that kind of
psychiatrist.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t talk to me like I’m one of your postdocs,” she said,
and he took a long breath.</p>
<p>He said, “Kate, we’re involved with each other, Kate.”</p>
<p>“Jim’s your friend.”</p>
<p>“And so are you my friend.”</p>
<p>“Your wife is my friend, too.” She continued, “Fuck, I hate this. Now
this motherfucking phone is beeping. Hold on. Elliot, can you hold on?”
She swapped the bedroom phone for the insufficiently charged kitchen
phone, went with that phone back into the bedroom, and sat on the edge
of the bed.</p>
<p>“Kate, why are you bringing up Susan? I need to know what your point
is. We agreed that we weren’t going to talk about Susan. So where are
you going with this? Kate? Are you there?”</p>
<p>He waited.</p>
<p>“Will you talk to me? Please, don’t do this. Don’t do this, Kate. All
right, fuck this, fuck this, fuck—”</p>
<p>His phone was beeping. It wasn’t the battery. It was another call. He
said, “Kate, hang on a minute. Hang on, Kate.”</p>
<p>He took the call. “Hello?”</p>
<p>“It’s me,” she said, and then informed him in a miserable voice that
both her home phones were dead, and that she was on her cell phone and
just wanted to say that she didn’t much enjoy dishonesty.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to speak up,” he said.</p>
<p>“Can you hear me? Tell me when the signal is clear.” She pressed the
cell phone against her ear and walked from the bedroom to the living
room, then into the kitchen, then straight down the hall, passing the
tiny second bathroom, with the broken, unusable toilet, to the
apartment’s miniature front foyer.</p>
<p>“Here?” she said. “Here?”</p>
<p>“I’m losing you,” he said. And so she retraced her route, winding up
back in the living room, where she turned on a lamp. The sky was dark.
Everywhere on the city’s horizon she saw other people’s lit windows.
Once again, Elliot had bullied her—or she’d let him bully her—into
leaving open the question of their affair. What was the use in arguing,
anyway? Jim would come home any minute, and, a little later, the two of
them would go out and meet Elliot and Susan for dinner. How crazy was
that? She still had to shower and dress. She conceded to Elliot, “All
right, I’ll think about it.”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, then?” Elliot said, and added, “I knew you’d come to your
senses.” He joked that if he didn’t get out of his office in the next
few minutes he’d be forced to show up at the restaurant in his white
coat. They said goodbye, and she put down the phone and wept for a
quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>Downstairs at the florist’s, Jim’s bouquet for Kate was growing and
growing. It featured not only yellow roses but red and pink solitaires,
along with sprigs of heather, freesia, and alstroemeria; green and white
calla lilies; blue irises; mums; and some other things the girl had
plucked from buckets and waved in the air for him to see and approve.
“What else? What does she like?” she’d asked him, as she leaned into the
refrigerator and reached for more.</p>
<p>“That looks so nice. I think she’ll like just what you like,” he
said, and wondered whether it was O.K. for him to have said it. Was it
provocative? There were no other customers in the shop. Staying close
but keeping his distance, he followed the girl from one display case to
another. He might as well have been buying lingerie, he felt; and, in
fact, it seemed to him that the bouquet was somehow intended for the
girl, as much as for Kate, who would’ve been, well, not exactly
mortified to know that her husband was downstairs using a shopgirl as a
proxy to get himself worked up for sex later that night.</p>
<p>“Baby’s breath,” the girl said to him.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“I love baby’s breath.”</p>
<p>“In that case, we’ll have to have a bunch,” Jim said.</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>She turned away, laid the unfinished bouquet on its side on the
countertop beside the cash register, and, with her back to him, said,
“We have a lot to work with here.” She glanced back over her shoulder
(did she want him to come closer?), then, quickly—what a great flirt, he
thought—turned away again and set to work breaking down the bouquet and
separating the flowers into groups, a variegated series of stacks that
she arranged not by color or type (except in the case of the combined
red, pink, and yellow roses) but, as became clear, by stem length. When
she had her piles, she picked up clippers.</p>
<p>“This will take a minute,” she said.</p>
<p>He watched her snip the stems. He said, “Take your time.”</p>
<p>But there was a problem: what were these flowers going to cost? The
bouquet as she assembled it—as it came to be, in her hands—was broader
and taller by far than what he’d come into the florist’s wanting. It was
less a bouquet than a proper arrangement, a centerpiece, thanks in part
to the leafy green branches the girl stuffed between blossoms, and the
pale-white baby’s breath, which she didn’t so much layer as clump into
the globular mass.</p>
<p>“Can we take some out?” he asked, and wished he hadn’t. What kind of
man courts a woman by letting her make an enormous bouquet for his wife,
then asks her to pare back?</p>
<p>“What would you like me to take out?” the girl asked. Was she
annoyed? She had her back to him. Did she think less of him? Did she
think he was a cheap bastard who cheats on his wife?</p>
<p>“It’s just that I was hoping to use a particular Arts and Crafts vase
on the mantel, which, in my opinion, these would look lovely in,” he
elaborately lied. (Actually, there was a vase on the mantel—but so
what?) He went on, “What I mean to say is that the vase I have in mind
isn’t very big.”</p>
<p>Did he need excuses? Did he need to bring up his home life?</p>
<p>He went into reverse. “Come to think of it, never mind about that
vase on the mantel. It would be a shame to wreck such a nice
bouquet.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to wreck anything.”</p>
<p>Was she scolding him? Were things heating up between them? He waited
for her next move.</p>
<p>“I can give you a bigger vase,” she proposed, finally.</p>
<p>He held his breath. She had to be at least twenty years younger than
he. But it wasn’t their age difference, nor the fact that he was
married, that made him feel uncertain of himself. The problem was his
thought process: the lithium he was taking in small doses brought a
slower speed to reality. It was the lithium or the antidepressant
cocktail or all of it in concert. At times, when he spoke, he felt as if
a kind of mental wind were blowing his thoughts back at him, forcing him
to self-consciously order his syntax as he pushed words out.</p>
<p>“I just got—I just got out of the hospital!” he blurted.</p>
<p>He watched her as she turned to face him; in her hands she held white
lilies and a red satin bow, and her eyes looked left, right, left.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t’ve said that! Forget I said that! I didn’t mean to say
that! Give me the vase. I want a vase.”</p>
<p>“Oh!” she said, as if startled to realize that she was still
clutching pieces of the bouquet. “Let me run in the back and get
one.”</p>
<p>While Jim and the girl sorted themselves out downstairs, Kate was
marching around the apartment in her red platform heels, shoving items
into her purse and looking in the usual places for her keys. She had to
flee before Jim walked in. She could phone him from the street and tell
him that she’d meet him at the restaurant. Going from Elliot to Jim to
Elliot and Jim and Susan without a break was bullshit. But, seriously,
where was she going to go? It was too cold out to sit on a bench. The
bar next door to the restaurant was bleak and depressing, an old men’s
dive, and the bar inside the restaurant would be a mob scene of people
pushing for tables. She could stand idly flipping through magazines at
the newsstand across Broadway, but that would mean accommodating the
line of men squeezing past her to look at porn at the rear of the store.
She slammed the apartment door behind her and started down the five
flights of stairs. Too often in winter she failed to leave the apartment
before sunset. It worked hell on her mood.</p>
<p>Outside, the wind was blowing hard. She wasn’t wearing a hat. She
tightened her scarf around her neck, tugged up her coat collar, lowered
her head, and walked toward Broadway with her fists punched down into
her pockets and her purse clinched under her arm. If only it would snow.
But when did it ever snow anymore? Hat or no hat, she wouldn’t’ve minded
a few snowflakes swirling down through the city light to settle on her
head. When she’d been a girl, snow had lain on the ground all winter.
That was what she remembered. Of course, she was thinking of the farm,
of New England, not New York. So what was her point? These days, it
rarely snowed the way it had back in the years before her parents died.
The snowfalls she remembered from her childhood seemed lost to time and,
she supposed, the changing climate.</p>
<p>She hurried along as quickly as she could in her high heels. At
Broadway, she turned uptown and passed the florist’s, where the pretty
shop assistant had just come out from the back with the flowers—flowers
for her, for Kate—in their vase.</p>
<p>“Here we are,” the girl announced to Jim. She extended her arms and
held the flowers out in front of her, presenting them. Before he could
move to take them from her, however—it was the medication, warping his
mind and delaying his reaction—she heaved the arrangement onto the
counter and explained that she’d had to search high and low for an
extra-heavy vase, one that was not only broad enough but also deep
enough to properly anchor the bouquet.</p>
<p>Jim and the girl admired her creation. With its stalks vertical and
free to fan out or droop down, the bouquet’s real immensity became
apparent. Roses with their thorns stuck out everywhere, and the lilies,
whose columnar stalks the girl had bunched at the center, shot up
through the top of the bouquet like, like, like—like insane trees
towering above some insane world, he thought. He was light-headed when
he spoke. “I love the way you’ve used ribbons and bows to tie the
blossoms into clusters. It looks like a bouquet made of little bouquets!
There’s so much to see! I can smell the lilies. Don’t you want to inhale
that scent? Do you know the painter Fragonard? Do you know Boucher? Look
at Boucher’s flowers. They’re practically obscene. There might be a
Boucher hanging at the Frick.”</p>
<p>He went for it. “Do you like museums?”</p>
<p>“When I have time.”</p>
<p>“I could show you the Frick!” He grinned widely and shrugged his
shoulders and tipped his head, and she mirrored him, shrugging her own
shoulders and making a funny face.</p>
<p>“You’re very good at what you do,” he added, and she said, “Thank
you,” then asked him, “How would you like to pay?”</p>
<p>He tried to imagine what he’d be forced to spend. Whatever the
amount, it would be too great. The bills from his recent
hospitalizations were mainly covered by Kate’s insurance—the policy was
hers; they’d gone ahead and got married in order for him to take
advantage of it during this protracted (Kate’s word, sometimes used
sarcastically) time of crisis in his life—but there were nevertheless
many outstanding fees, brand-new bills arriving every other week, plus
the only partly reimbursable expense of the aftercare program he
attended across town, on the Upper East Side.</p>
<p>“Let’s charge it.” He handed the girl his debit card.</p>
<p>She swiped the card. “It’s not going through,” she said. After
passing the card through the machine a second time, she apologized.
“This doesn’t automatically mean that there’s a problem with the
account,” she said. “You’ll have to contact your bank. Would you like to
try another account?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have another. Tell me the total?”</p>
<p>“Three hundred and forty-one dollars and sixty cents.”</p>
<p>His anxiety spiked and he took a breath. How could a bouquet of
flowers be that much?</p>
<p>He put his hand in his pocket and felt around for cash, but what was
the point?</p>
<p>“Hold on a minute,” he said.</p>
<p>What to do, what to do? He was going to have to call his wife. Was he
going to have to call her? He was going to have to call her. He took out
his phone and dialled—in that moment he was glad that he had his meds on
board—and right away Kate picked up and hollered, “Where are you? I’m at
the restaurant with Susan! Elliot is out parking the car. Did you go to
your therapy?”</p>
<p>“Could you not shout, Kate?”</p>
<p>“It’s goddam packed in here!”</p>
<p>“I need to talk to you, privately,” he said, and turned away from the
shopgirl. But there was no way, in the small space, to keep the girl
from overhearing, so he put his hand over the phone, leaned toward her,
and whispered, “I’ll be right back,” then stepped out of the shop, stood
on the sidewalk in the freezing wind, and slowly, deliberately
humiliated himself, saying to Kate, “I stopped on my way home and bought
you flowers, but the bank account isn’t coöperating with my card for
some reason and now I’m stuck at the florist’s because I don’t have
enough cash on me, and I think the problem is simply that—shit, I don’t
know what the problem is, I must not have kept my eye on the balance,
and it’s possible that we’re overdrawn. I know we’ve talked about this.
But it’s not a serious problem, I promise.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Jim. Are you spending? How much have you spent?” Kate cried, and
he winced.</p>
<p>He said, “Is Susan there?”</p>
<p>“Do you not hear a word I say? She’s right here! We’re drinking
Manhattans. Are you coming? We’re waiting for you. Why do you want to
talk to Susan? Jim, are you spending our money?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to talk to Susan. I’d just prefer that this
conversation be private between the two of us.”</p>
<p>“Please, Jim, as if everyone we know doesn’t already know everything
there is to know?”</p>
<p>“I’m not—I am not spending our money.”</p>
<p>“You’re agitated.”</p>
<p>“Why are you diagnosing me? I’m not agitated. I wanted to surprise
you with flowers. But clearly it was just another of my many mistakes.
I’ll think twice next time. Everything I do is unwanted.”</p>
<p>“Stop it,” Kate said to him then.</p>
<p>Through the phone he could hear sounds from the restaurant bar,
voices and other noises in the after-work crush. Then the wind came up,
and the only sound he heard was the phone’s own static. The wind died,
and Kate’s voice was saying, “Elliot is here now, and Lorenzo is
clearing us a table. Let me talk to someone about the flowers.”</p>
<p>In this way he was forced to trudge back into the shop, hold the
phone out, and say to the girl, “She wants to talk to you.”</p>
<p>The girl hesitated, then reached out and let him pass the phone into
her hand.</p>
<p>“Hello?” she said into his phone.</p>
<p>He retreated to a corner of the store. Joking aside, he didn’t care
to loiter about, smelling the flowers, while the girl wrote down his
wife’s American Express number. He would never learn the girl’s name,
not now, Kate would see to that, he told himself as he peered out from
his hiding place behind a leafy potted tree. He saw the shop’s buckets
of flowers and the refrigerators in a row, and the door leading to the
back, but where was the girl? He heard her laugh in response to some
remark Kate must’ve made, and realized that she was standing behind the
bouquet. “Oh, don’t I just know that about men and their important
purchases!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>What was Kate saying to her? Was he being made fun of, as usual? Was
she calling him bipolar?</p>
<p>He had a problem with anxiety and suicidality, and, as Kate had
reminded him in their conversation a moment earlier, everyone knew about
his previous autumn’s sojourns on the Fifty-ninth Street Bridge and his
games of chicken—no, not games, not at all, really—on the fire escape
outside their bedroom window.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to think about any of that. Yet it was the reason he
was now crouched behind a ficus, eavesdropping while a girl he wanted to
fuck got treated to an earful of Kate—on his phone! And what was the big
problem, anyway, if, a handful of times on his way home from day care,
as he sometimes called his ongoing treatment, he’d got excited about
life and jumped off the crosstown bus at Fifth Avenue and run into
Bergdorf Goodman and ridden the elevator to the second floor and tried
on clothes until closing? Was that unhealthy? His doctors didn’t think
he was manic-depressive; in fact, they’d ruled it out. Kate had been
reading the clinical literature, though, and felt autodidactically
certain that the Payne Whitney professionals were minimizing something
in plain sight: his death-trip history, considered alongside the
“conspicuous” spending on coats, ties, shirts, and shoes, represented,
at the least, she thought, a mixed-state depression. “Why don’t they
have you on Olanzapine?” she’d got in the habit of asking him. He begged
her not to interfere with his treatment, and suggested—thinking of her
father’s death and the forfeiture of the family farm in Massachusetts,
when she was a teen-ager—that her consuming anxiety about bankruptcy,
her emphasis on this as a potentially mortal trauma, might have less to
do with his new handmade suits than with the ways in which his almost
dying had reactivated an old mourning in her.</p>
<p>He peered from behind the ficus. He was wearing a ridiculous cashmere
overcoat, and his suit today was a medium-gray flannel herringbone. It
featured, on the jacket, minimal shoulder padding, dual vents, and a
graceful, three-rolled-to-two-button stance (his current favorite lapel
style), and, on the pants, single-reverse pleats and
one-and-a-quarter-inch-cuffed trouser legs. Why would a man ever not
cuff his trousers? He kept a single jacket-sleeve button open on the
left, another open on the right. He didn’t look like blown credit. Did
he?</p>
<p>Kate was going to kill him. She was mad enough to kill him. That was
a fact. What was he doing, charging expensive flowers for no reason on
an average night in the middle of the week when they were already
committed to a crippling tab—it was sure to be a huge bar bill, by
evening’s close—for dinner with Elliot and Susan? But, Kate thought, as
she sat with their friends, waiting for him at a tiny table near the
back of the restaurant, this was how it went with her husband: he made
the gestures; she absorbed the costs. “How awful this all is,” she
sighed. She was on the phone to the girl at the florist’s. Kate hadn’t
meant to be audible, not to the girl, and certainly not to Elliot, who
would take her vexation over Jim as a cue to call her up the next day
and argue for more afternoons at the hotel.</p>
<p>She’d been going once or sometimes twice a week to the East Side to
meet Elliot at the Lowell Hotel, on Sixty-third Street between Madison
and Park. She rode the bus. Typically, she arrived first. She got the
room key, went up, and showered; if Elliot was held up at the lab and
the day was growing dark, she might unlock the minibar and concoct a
Manhattan or an approximation of a Manhattan, then recline naked by the
window and look north toward the East Nineties, Carnegie Hill, where her
mother, an only child, like Kate, had lived before marrying her father
and moving to the farm.</p>
<p>Manhattans had been her mother’s drink. Unlike her mother, Kate tried
to keep herself to three an evening. At Lorenzo’s that night, she was
ahead of pace, finishing her second before having eaten a bite. She held
her glass in one hand and her phone in the other, listening hard through
the restaurant noise as the girl at the florist’s recited back her AmEx
number. Elliot sat quietly beside her. He had his arms crossed, and his
chair pushed back at an angle to make room for his legs. Susan had got
up from the table; she’d announced to Kate—sounding well on the way to
being tight—“Kate, you’re my best friend, but I don’t know how you drink
such a strong drink.” To Kate and Elliot together, she’d added, “Will
you two do me a big giant favor? Will you snag Lorenzo and ask him to
bring me a Cosmo?”</p>
<p>“Don’t utter a word to me about my husband,” Kate warned Elliot, once
Susan had gone to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Into the phone, to the girl, she said, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean you.
I was talking to somebody else.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the women’s room, Susan was on her own phone, calling
Jim’s number from a stall.</p>
<p>It was the girl who answered, of course.</p>
<p>“Hello, can you hold?” the girl said. The line went briefly dead.
After a pause, the girl came back and said, “May I ask who is
calling?”</p>
<p>“May I ask who’s answering?”</p>
<p>“Hold, please.”</p>
<p>“Sir?” the girl called out to Jim. She looked this way and that for
him. Where had he gone? The shop closed at eight. It was nearly closing
time. “A woman is calling you!”</p>
<p>“I’m here! I’m right here!” he answered from behind his tree.</p>
<p>“He’ll be with you in one second,” he heard her promise the caller.
After that, there was a pause, before, in a businesslike tone, the girl
resumed with Kate. “I’m sorry to have to ask you this again. Would you
mind verifying the last five digits and the expiration date?”</p>
<p>Back when he was in the hospital—in the past six months, there had
been three emergency-room visits and two locked-ward admissions—he had
spent day after day lying on a mattress, crying. His doctors (along with
the psychiatric nurses and the social workers who led the daily therapy
groups) had encouraged him to uncurl himself from the fetal position and
try, at least try, to watch television or play a board game with the
other patients, but this had mostly proved too great a challenge. There
had been times when, walking to or from the bathroom or the water
fountain or the patients’ common room, or standing in line to receive
his medications at the nurses’ station, or even simply sitting upright
on the table in the examining room, he’d had the strong sensation that
the air through which he moved was gathering around him and
becoming—really, no word was sufficient to name it—substantive. Its
weight pressed in on him. This hurt, it hurt terribly, yet when he tried
to locate the source of the pain he could not: it came, as he knew, only
from himself. On the mattress, shattered and sobbing over, say, Kate and
their messed-up love, he’d lain crushed, as if by atmospheres.</p>
<p>“Sir?”</p>
<p>The girl’s voice seemed to echo through the shop. He peeked up. When
had she come out from behind the bouquet? He could see her standing on
the other side of the tree. She was looking at him through the
leaves.</p>
<p>“Are you all right, sir?”</p>
<p>“I maybe—I need a minute.” His mouth was dry and his heart was
beating fast. That could be his meds, of course.</p>
<p>“There’s someone who wants to talk to you. Do you think you can take
the call? Would you like to try?” She held his phone out with one hand,
reaching toward him through the branches.</p>
<p>He had to reach into the tree to meet her hand. He was sweating.</p>
<p>“Hello?” he said into the phone.</p>
<p>“What the hell, Jim?” Susan said to him from the women’s-room toilet
at Lorenzo’s.</p>
<p>“Susan, how are you?” he said.</p>
<p>“I’ve been better.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“We’re all here, Jim. We’re waiting and waiting for you.”</p>
<p>“I’m doing my best to get there. Have you ordered yet? What are the
specials? What looks good?”</p>
<p>“Kate is beside herself. She says the two of you are bankrupt. She
says you’ve spent all the money.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie to me, Jim. Please, don’t lie to me.” She was sniffling,
beginning to weep, lightly.</p>
<p>“Stop crying, stop crying, baby,” he whispered into the phone. Then
he laid his hand over the receiver and said to the girl, who was still
peering down at him through the leaves of the tree, “You’ll have to
excuse me one more time.” With a powerful effort of will, he stood
upright and came out from behind the ficus. He didn’t dare look at the
girl, but he heard her telling him, as he pushed painfully past her
toward the door, that it looked like his wife’s American Express card
wasn’t working, either—and was there any way for him to pay for the
flowers?</p>
<p>He waved his hand, motioning that he’d return. He stepped out into
the cold on Broadway. He pulled up his overcoat’s shawl collar. The door
to the florist’s closed behind him.</p>
<p>Back at their table for four, Kate and Elliot had hit a snag.</p>
<p>“Let me talk to him,” Elliot said. He had his elbows on the table.
He’d drunk almost none of his Scotch.</p>
<p>“That’s not a good idea.”</p>
<p>“Give me your phone.” He held out his hand.</p>
<p>“I’m on hold.”</p>
<p>“Kate,” he said.</p>
<p>“Leave me alone.”</p>
<p>“As you wish,” he said, leaning back in his chair, and she burst out
at him, “How can you act like this? You’re a doctor. How can you be so
unfeeling?”</p>
<p>He said, “What does my being a doctor have to do with my feelings?”
(She rolled her eyes at this, but he didn’t appear to notice.) He went
on, “I may be a doctor, but I’m not your husband’s doctor.”</p>
<p>“His name is Jim, remember?”</p>
<p>“I think you’re drunk. That’s what I think.”</p>
<p>He got up from the table, patted his pockets—checking for his own
phone—and said, “God damn it, I do research. I don’t treat patients. He
has excellent doctors. I’ll call him myself.”</p>
<p>When he’d gone and Kate was alone, Lorenzo arrived with Susan’s
Cosmopolitan.</p>
<p>“Everybody has gone away and left you,” Lorenzo said, and Kate
chirped back, “Everybody’s gone!”</p>
<p>“Let me bring you another Manhattan.” Lorenzo placed Susan’s cocktail
on the table and picked up Kate’s empty glass. Kate managed a little
smile. She held her phone to her ear. “Jim? Jim, are you there?” she
whispered.</p>
<p>Six blocks downtown, Jim was on the line to Susan. “I’m here, I’m
here with you, baby,” he assured her. In fact, he wasn’t thinking of
sleeping with her again. Oh, he’d loved sleeping with Susan—that wasn’t
the problem. But that evening his body was compressing: the weight of
the air was on him, flattening his libido and his trust in
humankind.</p>
<p>“Susan,” he said. “Susan.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” she said. Her voice filled the stall. “What is
happening? Is it happening? Is it happening to you now? I’m so scared.
What do I do?”</p>
<p>“Susan,” he said. “Susan.”</p>
<p>He explained to her that in a few minutes he was going to calmly walk
back inside the florist’s and steal a mysterious and beautiful bouquet
that he and an angel had made for Kate. He’d helped the angel, he
pointed out. He was feeling honest. He acknowledged to Susan that he was
speaking metaphorically when it came to angels—in order to seem
aboveboard and keep her trust. He needed her to be cool when he entered
the restaurant, he told her. Then he ended the call and switched over to
Kate.</p>
<p>“I’m coming,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m glad,” she said.</p>
<p>“I love you,” he said.</p>
<p>“I love you, I love you,” she said. She was alone at their table.</p>
<p>She said, “Have you talked to Elliot?”</p>
<p>He said, “I haven’t heard from him.”</p>
<p>Elliot, in the meantime, had been unable to get through, Jim’s phone
lines having been taken up by both their wives. He’d left two messages
already, one saying, “Jim, call me, all right?,” the other, “Jim, will
you call me?” His third attempt got through, but Jim didn’t answer. He
heard the beeping, plucked the phone away from his ear, glanced at it,
saw who was calling, and said, to Kate, “It’s him. There is no way that
I want to speak to him right now.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” she said. Then she said, “Just get here, dear, and
have dinner with us. We all need food. We need to eat.”</p>
<p>He said, “Has he taken care with you, since I’ve been gone?”</p>
<p>“Gone?” she said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how else to put it.”</p>
<p>She asked, “Will you stay where you are, until people come?”</p>
<p>“Don’t send an ambulance,” he said to her.</p>
<p>He put his phone in his pocket. He turned and faced the door to the
flower shop. A few people swept past him on the windy avenue—or so it
seemed; his thoughts were with the pain that was coalescing beneath his
temple. He wanted to put it out. He could imagine different ways to do
this. This was how it was when his mind turned to high open windows or
unlocked rooftop fire doors or breaks in the chain-link fences lining
bridge walkways.</p>
<p>He took a step forward. The door was made partly of glass, and he
could see into the shop. It occurred to him that it would be easy to
break the window with his fist and deliberately cut up the veins in his
arms. Instead, he put his hand on the doorframe and pushed. He stuck his
head inside. He was acting guiltily, though he knew there was no reason
to, not at the florist’s—he hadn’t done anything yet. Still, he snuck
in, ashamed.</p>
<p>The girl was nowhere in sight. The bouquet looked bigger than it had
the last time he’d sized it up. How would he manage to get it up
Broadway in his trembling hands? Beside it on the table—careful, he had
to be careful—were the girl’s pruning shears, as well as regular
scissors and a small sharp knife.</p>
<p>He told himself to let those things lie.</p>
<p>Uptown at the restaurant, Lorenzo brought Kate her drink. She asked
for bread, and apologized to him for taking so long to order dinner.
“We’ll all be here together soon,” she sighed.</p>
<p>She was right about that. Elliot had given up trying to reach Jim,
and the cold had driven him back inside. He was threading his way down
the aisle to their table. Susan, too, would return, as soon as she had
peed. Pride had made her unable to, while on the phone.</p>
<p>And that left Jim, who had no desire to become a thief. Might he,
instead, offer something in barter for the flowers? His wristwatch
wasn’t worth much. His overcoat was brand-new, and cost well more than
the watch and the bouquet combined. He decided to leave an I.O.U.,
promising to come back another day with money, or, if not with actual
money, then with a clear idea of when one or another of his or his
wife’s credit cards might again be active and usable.</p>
<p>But when he tried to hold a pen in his hand, he could not; and when
he tried to focus his eyes on the piece of paper lying beside the cash
register—it was the scrap of a receipt on which the girl had pencilled
Kate’s American Express information—he found that his mind was frantic.
This was his disorder. This was the descent. He crumpled the receipt and
shoved it into his pocket. He reached for the bouquet. The girl had put
water in the vase.</p>
<p>Had you been walking downtown on Broadway that February night at a
little past eight, you might have seen a man hurrying toward you with a
great concrescence of blooms. You might have noticed that he did not
even pause for traffic signals, but charged across streets against the
lights; and so you might rightly have supposed that he could not see
through the floral arrangement that he held (doing what he could to keep
clear of thorns) at arm’s length before him. Whenever a siren sounded in
the distance—and, once, beating helicopter blades in the night sky
caused him to sprint up a side street—he dropped into a furtive,
crouching gait. His balance was off; he was paranoid about police.
Windblown flowers lashed at his head. Seen from a distance, he might
have brought to mind an old, out-of-favor stereotype: the savage in a
headdress. But as he came closer, you would have noticed his European
clothes, his stylish haircut; and you might have asked yourself, “What’s
wrong with that man?”</p>
<p>Had you stepped to the side as he hurtled past, tightened your scarf
securely around your neck, and continued on your way, you might next
have encountered a young woman on a street corner, distraught and
coatless. “Did you happen to see a man carrying a bouquet of flowers?”
she might have asked in a startled voice, and you would have looked away
from her bare, pale legs, pointed upwind, and told her, “He went that
way.” By then, the first snowflakes would have been swirling through the
caverns between the apartment buildings, down onto the thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Jim looked up and saw the snow on his way into Lorenzo’s. For an
instant, he took it as an omen—of what, though? He pulled hard on the
restaurant door, forcing it open, and stumbled with his tattered flowers
into the dark realm between the door and the velvet drapes that had been
hung to keep the cold from sweeping in over diners at the front of the
room.</p>
<p>He parted the curtains. “Pardon me,” he said to the people seated
near the entrance. Long- and short-stemmed flowers alike had snagged on
the drapes. Now a waiter approached—and here came Lorenzo, too, calling,
in his soft, ristoratore’s voice, “Ciao, James. Ciao. I cannot call you
Jim, you know.”</p>
<p>“Lorenzo, ciao,” Jim said. The waiter was busy tugging on the
curtains. Lorenzo lent a hand. “This way, try this way,” Lorenzo
instructed. Jim spun left then right, enshrouding himself—and the
bouquet—within the folds of drapery fabric. There followed a flurry of
petals. The rose thorns came loose; the bouquet’s topmost stems sprung
free. He tumbled out into the room.</p>
<p>“I’m good, I’m fine,” he said, nodding reassuringly (he hoped) to
Lorenzo, the waiter, the people who’d turned in their seats to
stare.</p>
<p>“What has happened to you, James?” Lorenzo pulled his white silk
pocket square from his breast pocket and reached around the yellow and
pink and blue and white flowers to dab at Jim’s forehead.</p>
<p>“I ran all the way here,” Jim said.</p>
<p>“You’re bleeding,” Lorenzo told him. Jim saw the blood spotting
Lorenzo’s handkerchief.</p>
<p>Lorenzo said, “You have a lot of scratches. You look like you’ve been
in a fight with some squirrels or something.” He laughed, nicely.</p>
<p>“I’ve—I have been fighting, Lorenzo. Not with squirrels. Roses,” Jim
specified, and Lorenzo said, “Ah, of course. Let me take them.”</p>
<p>He spoke to the waiter. “Paul, will you please take these from
James?” To Jim, he added, “We will bring them to your table.”</p>
<p>“No, no,” Jim said. He explained to Lorenzo that the flowers were a
gift for Kate, and that he needed to present them himself. This was
crucial, he informed Lorenzo. He clutched the vase. His pants were wet
from water that had sloshed over the rim. Water stained his shoes. He
could see tiny snags marking the sleeves of his overcoat and the front
of his suit. How frustrating, after having labored so hard to avoid the
thorns. His clothes would have to go to a reweaver, he thought. Then his
thinking disintegrated into bitter resignation. Everything he touched
was ruined. The flowers were almost destroyed.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he bore them down the aisle. Here and there, people
ducked forward in their chairs, or to the side, letting him through. As
he progressed toward the back, the room quieted. People put down their
silverware, their wineglasses; Jim felt eyes watching him.</p>
<p>“Eat! Live while you can!” he wanted to proclaim to the crowd. But
what did he have to teach anyone? He was a thief, a common
criminal—worse. He’d stolen a bouquet to give to the love of his
life.</p>
<p>When she saw him, she was filled with happiness. She’d had a lot to
drink—but, well, it wasn’t that alone.</p>
<p>“Kate,” he said. She stood, and he lurched toward her. Elliot and
Susan stood as well. They flanked Kate, who came out from between
them—not unlike Jim, she was unsteady on her feet—saying, “I’m sorry,
excuse me,” as she tacked her way through the sea of tables.</p>
<p>They met near the bathrooms. The bar was to their right. Kate raised
her open hands to wipe the blood from his face. Blood had run down his
neck, and stained the collar of his shirt. “These are for you,” he told
her.</p>
<p>She was quietly crying, whispering, “They’re beautiful, beautiful.”
Then her crying began in force, and she wailed, “You made it, oh, you
made it, we were all so scared, and I felt so lost.”</p>
<p>“I’m here,” he said, and his own tears started. He wanted to tell her
that everything would be better, that he would be better, that one day
soon he would work again, and start paying some bills, and take the
burden off her shoulders; that they would be able, at last, to leave the
little apartment with the busted plumbing. He wanted to tell her how
much he needed her.</p>
<p>But he could see, out of the corner of his eye, his horrid reflection
in the mirror behind the bar. He looked down at Kate’s hands, the blood
smeared across her palms. And he saw the restaurant-goers and the
waiters and waitresses and busboys, who, not knowing what to make of the
bleeding and the crying and the broken lilies arcing over Jim and Kate’s
heads like some insane wedding canopy, had come from the kitchen or the
bar to stand mutely around them. The pain in his body grew, and the
words that spilled out of him were not words of love. Or they were. He
spoke to his wife, as he spoke to the people gathered.</p>
<p>“Don’t you see, Kate? Don’t you see? It’s time for me to go. I can’t
do this anymore. I have no place here. I don’t belong. I hurt so. You
can live and be happy. That will never be for me.”</p>
<p>“No, no, baby,” she wept at him.</p>
<p>Someone touched his arm. It was Elliot, who’d come up behind him. He
said to Jim, “Let’s get in the car.”</p>
<p>Lorenzo was there, too. Kate said to Jim, “Honey, let Lorenzo take
the flowers. Just for now,” and he did.</p>
<p>A moment later, Lorenzo came back with a wet cloth. Kate used it to
wipe her eyes and to clean Jim’s face and her hands. She tied the belt
around his overcoat. She said, “There.”</p>
<p>They went out of the restaurant, the four of them. Susan let Jim lean
on her, and Elliot steadied Kate. On the way out the door, they heard
Lorenzo, behind them, telling his patrons, “Everything is all right. Our
friend has had a bad time. Please, let me buy everyone a drink.”</p>
<p>On Broadway, the wind had died, and the air seemed to have warmed.
They walked out into new snow. And, wouldn’t you know, Jim did wrap his
arm around Susan’s shoulders, and Elliot ducked down close to Kate,
listening to her mumble whatever it was she had to say to him.</p>
<p>At the garage, Jim and Kate got into the back seat of Elliot’s car.
Susan sat beside Elliot. Elliot started the engine, turned on the
headlights and the windshield wipers. Thump, thump, thump. He steered
east. During the trip, Jim took his belt from around his waist. He gave
Kate his scarf and his phone and his keys and all his money, which
amounted to about thirty dollars.</p>
<p>Later, she would get on her knees on the emergency-room floor and
extract the laces from his shoes. A nurse would come, then another, and
a doctor promising sleeping pills.</p>
<p>By that time, after midnight, Elliot and Susan would have driven up
the F.D.R. Drive and out of Manhattan, through the Bronx, and into
Westchester County.</p>
<p>“You can go home now, if you’d like,” the doctor said to Kate. “We
won’t let anything happen to him.”</p>
<p>He gave Kate a plastic garbage bag, into which she put Jim’s overcoat
and his suit jacket. She would use the last of his money for her
crosstown taxi, and for milk and cereal at the Korean market near the
apartment.</p>
<p>In the deep of the night, they came for him. A male nurse helped him
into a wheelchair, and then pushed him through the white labyrinth of
hallways and waited for the elevator.</p>
<p>Margaret, one of the night nurses, met him on the ward. She said,
“Hello, Mr. Davis. You’re back with us again, I see.” She asked, “Do you
think you can walk?” She gave him Ativan and a paper cup of water, and
watched while he swallowed. Then she showed him to a room of his
own.</p>
