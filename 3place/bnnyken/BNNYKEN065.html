<h4 id="an-abduction">An Abduction</h4>
<p>By Tessa Hadley (2012)</p>
<p>Jane Allsop was abducted when she was fifteen, and nobody noticed.
This happened a long time ago, in Surrey, in the nineteen-sixties, when
parents were more careless. She was home from boarding school for the
summer, and day after day the sun rose into a cloudless sky, from which
Jane couldn’t unfix the word “cerulean,” which she’d learned in the art
room. (She wasn’t clever or literary, and was nervous of new words,
which seemed to stick to her.) “Cerulean” was more of a blank, baking
glare than mere merry blue. It prised its way each morning like a chisel
through the crack between Jane’s flowered bedroom curtains and between
the eyelids she squeezed tightly shut in an effort to stay inside her
dreams. It wasn’t acceptable in Jane’s kind of family to complain about
good weather, yet the strain of it told on them, parents and children:
they were remorselessly cheerful, while secretly they longed for rain.
Jane imagined herself curled up with a bag of licorice beside a
streaming windowpane, reading about the Chalet School. But her mother
said it was a crime to stay indoors while the sun shone, and Jane
couldn’t read outside with the same absorption; there was always some
strikingly perfect speckled insect falling onto your page like a
reminder (of what? of itself), or a root nudging into your back, or
stinging ants inside your shorts.</p>
<p>The morning of the abduction, Mrs. Allsop—dishevelled in a limp linen
shirtdress—was wielding her secateurs up a ladder, pruning the climbing
roses. She was immensely capable; tall and big-boned with a pink,
pleasant face and dry yellow hair chopped sensibly short. Jane admired
her mother greatly, especially when she transformed herself at night,
for a concert in London or a Rotary Club dinner, with clip-on pearl
earrings and lipstick and scent, a frilled taupe satin stole. Jane
coveted this stole and tried it on when her mother was at the shops,
making sultry faces at herself in the mirror—although sultry was the
last thing her mother was, and everyone told Jane that she looked just
like her. She certainly seemed to have her mother’s figure, with not
much bust, no waist to speak of, and a broad flat behind.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you call up some of your old friends?” Mrs. Allsop
suggested from the ladder top. “Invite them round to play
Ping-Pong.”</p>
<p>Jane responded with evasive enthusiasm. (She didn’t know her old
friends anymore; that was what happened when you were sent away to
boarding school.) She said she was heading inside to find her Jokari set
(a rubber ball attached by a long elastic string to a wooden base—you
could hit the ball back and forth with a paddle all by yourself for
hours on end). It was part of the family code that sport and physical
exercise were meaningful ways of passing leisure time; without them, you
risked dissipation, letting value slip away. Only Jane’s brother, Robin,
was allowed a special dispensation, because he was studying to get into
Oxford—it was all right for him to have his head stuck in a book all day
and to go around scowling, complaining that the sun gave him headaches.
When Jane strayed into Robin’s room (“Buzz off, shrimp, you’re not
permitted across my threshold”), he was curled up on his side on the
bed, his clasped hands between his drawn-up knees, his glasses off, and
his book propped across his face, Pink Floyd playing subduedly on the
stereo. It was obvious that he’d been smoking. Mrs. Allsop smoked, with
a casual elegance that startled Jane, but only on the silk-stole
evenings, or if she had women friends around for tea. (For Robin, blind
on his bed with a headache and sex fantasies and short-circuiting
flashes of insane ambition, his sister, mutely protesting—she simply
stood there till he got up and pushed her out and locked the door behind
her—was a visitant from his insipid past, when they’d been friends.)</p>
<p>Jane was listless, her mind a blank with vivid little jets of
dissatisfaction firing off in it. Real children, somewhere, were
wholesomely intent on untying boats or building dams or collecting
butterflies to asphyxiate in jars (as she and Robin had done one
summer). She should be like them, she reproached herself; or she should
be more thoroughly embarked on her teen-age self, like some of the girls
at school, painting on makeup, then scrubbing it off, nurturing crushes
on friends’ brothers she’d only ever seen from a distance, cutting out
pictures of pop stars from Jackie magazine. Jane knew that these girls
were ahead of her in the fated trek toward adulthood, which she had half
learned about in certain coy biology lessons. Yet theirs seemed also a
backward step into triviality, away from the thing that this cerulean
day—munificent, broiling, burning across her freckled shoulders, hanging
so heavily on her hands—ought to become, if only she knew better how to
use it.</p>
<p>She carried the Jokari set down through the patch of woodland toward
the bottom of the garden. Her sister, Frances, dark-skinned and fey, not
at all like their mother and not yet old enough for boarding school, had
chums around to play with. They were supposed to be clearing the drive
of rabbit droppings with spoons and plastic bags, for money, but they
were all four hunkered in a semicircle under the pine trees, where they
had set out tea things for their dolls, a pinecone on each tiny plate, a
rabbit dropping in each tiny cup. Jane heard Frances chanting in two
alternating voices while the others watched, in thrall to her.</p>
<p>“Don’t want it! Don’t want it!” Frances said in her whiny voice.</p>
<p>“Eat it up,” her vicious voice replied. “Take your nasty
medicine.”</p>
<p>When Jane came near, the little girls melted into the undergrowth
with hostile backward looks. She kicked their dolls over and hurled the
pinecones as far as she could toward the flaunting patches of sky
between the treetops (she had a strong throw, her father always said,
better than Robin’s); but she lacked conviction even in her malevolence.
“We hate her! She’s so ugly,” the witch-children hummed, drifting
between the bald pine trunks, keeping out of sight. Jane remembered, as
she often did, how once at a friend’s house she had overheard the dotty
grandmother asking too loudly who the “plain” one was. The witches
didn’t even bother to follow her, to spy on her, which would at least
have been some kind of game. She set up her Jokari on a scorched patch
of grass beside where their chalky drive debouched onto the road. No
cars passed. The road was a dead end, leading only to more big houses
like theirs, secretive behind their screens of trees, some atmospheric
with the half-timbering that Jane didn’t yet know was a badge of
inauthenticity, some with tennis courts from which the thwack of balls
didn’t often come.</p>
<p>Kicking off her flip-flops, she settled resignedly into her game. The
pock and thud of the Jokari ball on the baked ground soothed her, and
she started to care about whether she could break her own record of
consecutive hits. (She had passed Robin’s record long ago.) Rapt, she
didn’t notice her father steering the Rover down the drive, on his way
out to pick up the Saturday paper; to save petrol, he liked to roll down
with the hand brake off, starting the engine only when he turned into
the road. Jane scooped low to the ground under an awkward shot, getting
it up with too much force just as the sleek black of the car eased into
the edge of her vision; the ball on its elastic must have seemed smashed
deliberately and vindictively against the car’s side window (which
luckily was not open). Assaulted amid his reverie, Mr. Allsop was
outraged out of all proportion to the offense—nothing was broken. He
stopped the car and half stood up out of it to rant across its roof at
Jane: Stupid girl! Didn’t she have anything better to do? Then the car
rolled on, ominously firing to life when it felt the road, and Jane was
left wounded, staring after it. The wings of her spirit, which had been
beginning to soar, faltered and flung her to earth, because, after all,
she had been doing her best, nothing else; and also because her father
was supposed to be her ally in the family, though they weren’t at all
alike. Mr. Allsop was small and dark, like Frances, easily bored, and
clever with figures. He thought about Jane vaguely, through a fog of
fond concern, fearing that she had her mother’s flat, bland surface
without Mrs. Allsop’s force of conviction—or whatever it was that kept
her impermeable, buoyant.</p>
<p>Jane dropped her paddle in an uncharacteristic gesture of despair.
Tears stung her eyes; she stood with her hands by her sides, palms
outward, in a kind of resigned openness. What next, then, if even her
attempt at virtue had failed?</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>And that was how they first saw her. They passed Mr. Allsop in the
Rover; he was turning out of the un-made-up road just as they turned
into it. Mr. Allsop noticed them, because he knew most of the cars that
visited the road, and he didn’t recognize or much like the look of this
one: an expensive dark-green sporty two-seater convertible, with one
long-haired youth in a sloppy vest lolling in each seat, and one—smoking
something that might have been more sinister than a cigarette—squeezed
into the little luggage space behind, craning forward, as he was bound
to, between his friends. The driver, who had one languid hand on the
wheel, cornered carelessly in a puff of chalk dust, tires spitting loose
stones. (If they were my kids, Mr. Allsop thought, catch me allowing
them anywhere near my car. It’s not all bad that Robin’s such a drip.)
Had the family ever realized that Jane had been abducted, her father
would probably have remembered and suspected these visiting aliens.</p>
<p>The boys were drunk and stoned, and hadn’t been to bed at all the
night before (but then they hadn’t got out of bed until four the
previous afternoon). They were out looking for girls, in Nigel’s
father’s car. (Nigel was the one squeezed into the luggage space.)
They’d finished their second year at Oxford and were staying at Nigel’s
house, about a twenty-minute drive from the Allsops’, while his parents
were away in France. After sagging at dawn, dozing in the angular
Swedish armchairs in the lounge, and filling Nigel’s mother’s
fashionable ashtrays while listening to the Grateful Dead, all three had
found a second wind, swimming several thrashing lengths in Nigel’s pool.
The loveliness of the morning had then seemed their own fresh discovery:
the light as limpid as the water, birdsong skimming the flat echoless
air, the sun’s touch intricate on their skin. They had decided that they
needed to find girls to crown the day. That was a few hours ago. It had
taken them a while to get started; and then there’d been a striking
absence, everywhere they’d driven, of available girls.</p>
<p>“She’ll do,” one of them called out when they saw Jane, loud enough
for her to hear. It was Paddy (not Irish at all), the bulky,
clever-looking one in the passenger seat, with small eyes like chinks of
bright glass and greasy hair the color and texture of old rope, pushed
behind pink ears. He took the joint from Nigel and blinked at Jane
through its smoke with a sort of appraising impartial severity, not
lascivious.</p>
<p>“But where will we put these girls?” Nigel asked facetiously, after
one glance at Jane: he didn’t fancy sharing his small space (and wasn’t,
in fact, much interested in girls). Paddy explained that they’d have to
collect them one at a time.</p>
<p>Jane stood barefoot, hands still open in that gesture of
self-relinquishment. She wasn’t plain in that moment, though she didn’t
know it. Something was revealed in her that was normally hidden: an
auburn light in her face, her freckles startling as the camouflage of an
animal, blotting up against her lips and eyelids. There were ginger
glints, too, in her hair, which she wore in two bunches, fastened with
different-colored elastic bands. Her eyes with their pale lashes,
because she was unhappy, communicated keenly. Her family called her
pudgy, but she just looked soft, as if she were longing to nestle. Her
jawline was pure, the pale lips rather full, cracked, parted. She seemed
not fake or stuck up—and, just then in the dappled light, not a child,
either. None of this was wasted on the boys.</p>
<p>It didn’t occur to Jane that the car would stop for her; she watched
it hungrily, sifting the silky dust between her toes. Daniel, the
driver, Jane saw at once, was the best-looking of the three; in fact, he
was crushingly beautiful—his features smudged and vivid at once, as if
sketched in black ink—and her heart fastened on him. When he had stopped
the car, he asked her what her name was and she told him. “Want to come
for a ride?” he said kindly.</p>
<p>She hesitated only for a moment.</p>
<p>“Not in the back,” she said, quite clear about it. Already, she
didn’t care for Nigel.</p>
<p>“Between us in the front,” Paddy said, squeezing over.</p>
<p>And so she climbed in, carrying her flip-flops in her hand. On a
whim, she had decided against shorts that morning; she was wearing a
washed-out old dress in flowered cotton, with a Peter Pan collar.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>On their way back to Nigel’s house, Jane was an accomplice in an
episode of shoplifting—which fortunately went undetected, or at least
unreported. She had never stolen anything before; the possibility hadn’t
crossed her mind. But she was disoriented: as they drove along, Paddy
had pulled the elastic bands off her two bunches so that her hair blew
crazily into all their faces. Whipping across her vision, the strands of
it were like a hallucination, distracting her from her larger
bewilderment at half sitting on Paddy’s knee, feeling Daniel ease his
arm around her once, on a straight stretch when he wasn’t changing
gears. (Nigel’s father had chosen a manual gearbox on the M.G.C.) “It’s
all right,” Daniel had said. “Don’t worry about us. We’re not all
bad.”</p>
<p>“I like her,” Paddy commented. “She doesn’t talk too much.”</p>
<p>The oddest thing was that she wasn’t worrying, although she knew she
ought to be; especially when they made plans to keep the shopkeeper
talking while she, Jane, slipped bottles of whatever alcohol she could
get into their canvas haversack. “He keeps it in a little side room,”
Daniel said. “You don’t look as if you drink, so no one will suspect
you. If they do, you can cry and say that we kidnapped you and made you
do it.”</p>
<p>Jane didn’t recognize the shop, though it was only a few miles from
her home; her mother had most of their groceries delivered, and, anyway,
Mrs. Allsop would never have shopped in such a dimly lit,
cellar-smelling place, its windows hung with conflicting advertisements
for cigarettes and tea, its shelves crowded promiscuously with faded
tins, china souvenirs, regiments of sweet jars. A naked fat ham in
orange bread crumbs jostled for space on the counter with packets of
parsley sauce and marked-down broken biscuits. Repulsion at the ham’s
sickly flesh smell fuelled Jane’s impossible swift acts. She chose the
cool bottles by feel in the dark little off-license nook, beyond a
curtain of plastic strips, because she could hardly see in there; her
eyes were dazzled from the light outside. Her heart thudded as violently
as an engine stalling, but her hands were sure. The boys paid for the
sliced bread and tomatoes and tin of tuna they bought, thanking the
shopkeeper loftily as they left. Jane sat in the car again between them,
her trophies chinking on her knee.</p>
<p>“Isn’t she good?” Paddy said when they’d driven on and he’d excavated
in the haversack, finding dusty Mateus rosé and Johnnie Walker and
several bottles of barley wine.</p>
<p>“She’s a natural,” Daniel said.</p>
<p>“Now she belongs to us,” Paddy said. “We’ve got the dirt on her.”</p>
<p>Jane sought in the recesses of her consciousness the remorse that she
knew ought to be lying in wait—that poor honest shopkeeper, struggling
to make a living! But it was as if all recesses had flattened out for
the moment, into a balmy infinite present amid the sunshine and the
gusts and swirls of wind as the M.G.C. swerved around bends. Her
consciousness was filled to the brim with her contact—astonishing
because she was so virgin in contacts—with the boys’ warm bodies,
lapping against her; she didn’t even much mind Nigel’s chin resting
showily on her shoulder, when he leaned over from his perch in the back.
It had never occurred to her, until now, that the masculine—a suspect
realm of deep-voiced otherness, beard growth, fact-authority, and
bathroom smells—could be so intimately important, in relation to
herself; it seemed as improbable as two planets colliding.</p>
<p>Now, below the surface of the moment, she began to wait in
secret—patiently, because her self-discoveries were very new—for
Daniel’s hand to jostle her thigh when he changed gears. She stole long
gazes at him from behind the blinding strands of her hair, drinking in
whatever it was in his looks that tugged at her so exquisitely. His head
was poised on his slight frame in a way that reminded her of the poet’s
bust (she couldn’t remember which poet) on the piano at home, which
nobody played; his dark hair fell in floppy curls like the poet’s
sculpted ones, and his face had the same keen, forward-slanting lines. A
fine dimple of skin, puckering beside his mouth when he gave one of his
rare quick smiles, was a fatal last touch: Jane thought he was as
handsome as a rock star or a film star—only more so, because they
flaunted crudely from their posters, whereas Daniel held something
back.</p>
<p>Nigel had a bottle opener on his key ring, and they started on the
barley wine, after a discussion with Jane over whether she drank alcohol
or not. “I don’t,” she owned up candidly. “But I might start.” Daniel,
solicitous, said that they mustn’t give her too much, just a little sip
at a time. They watched her face to see whether she liked the taste and
laughed delightedly when it was obvious that she didn’t, although she
bravely insisted (“I do! I do quite like it!”), as entertained as if
they were feeding beer to a puppy.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>If Nigel’s parents’ house had been anything like Jane’s, she might
have felt a pang of recollection when they arrived, but although it was
secluded behind trees like hers, and with the same defensive air of
privilege, it was modern—all glass rectangles and slats of unpainted
reddish wood. Somehow it explained Nigel, Jane thought: his angular
unease and his gape, as if he were blinking in reflected light. Daniel
braked on the gravel with a flourish, and they got out of the car,
straggling in through the front of the house and then out again at the
back almost immediately, as if the bright indoors were an optical trick,
not absorbent like the gloomy interiors Jane knew, which were dense with
family history. A terrace at the back overlooked a garden landscaped in
Japanese style, with artful quartz boulders and ginkgo and Japanese
maple trees. The boys seemed unsure for a moment what to do next; Jane
knew from observing her mother that it was her role to fill awkward
silences.</p>
<p>“What a shame I didn’t bring my costume,” she remarked
conversationally, looking at the pool, which Nigel was supposed to skim
of its flotsam of twigs and leaves and dead insects every day, but
hadn’t.</p>
<p>“What costume, Bo Peep?” Nigel said. “This isn’t a fancy-dress
party.”</p>
<p>He’d become waspish at the sight of the awful mess in the house, torn
between bravado and responsibility (he thought about his mother); toying
with the idea of washing dishes, he put it aside for later.</p>
<p>“My swimming costume,” Jane explained.</p>
<p>Transplanted out of her familiar world, she seemed to find it easier
to be dignified, as if she were moving inside a different skin, sleeker.
Perhaps it was partly the barley wine. She was able to penetrate, too,
into the others’ motives and relations—grown-up insight seemed to come
not through gradual accretion but all at once. Daniel had power over the
other two, she saw, just as he had power over her, though not through
any conscious exertion of his will. They tracked his movements and his
moods: if he was at ease, then they could be, too. And yet he wasn’t
tyrannical, was only either pleasant or absent; if he was abstracted,
you felt the curse of your failure to interest him. (Paddy, who picked
up a book to read as soon as he sat down on the terrace, didn’t care as
much as she and Nigel did. Because he was cleverer, he was more
detached, with reserves of irony.) Now Daniel suggested coffee and
sandwiches, as if this were a summer lunch party and not the tail end of
an all-nighter. The idea made everyone carefree; they discovered they
were starving. Nigel hunted in the fridge for butter. If Jane had been
older, she might have taken the opportunity to parade her femininity in
the kitchen, but it didn’t occur to her. Daniel and Nigel made
tuna-and-salad-cream sandwiches; she waited with an air of calm
entitlement for hers to be brought to her.</p>
<p>While they ate, they catechized her on her opinions, and were
delighted to find that she believed in God and expected to vote
Conservative when she was twenty-one. (“Not just because my parents do,”
she insisted. “I shall read the newspapers and make up my own mind.”)
They were sitting on the terrace in Nigel’s mother’s striking wicker
chairs; Jane’s was a shallow cone set in a cast-iron frame. Daniel was
cross-legged on the terrace beside her. She said that it was only fair
for everyone to do a day’s hard work, and that people who criticized
England all the time should try going to live somewhere else, and that
she hated cruelty to animals. All the time she was talking, Daniel was
doing something to her feet, which dangled from the rim of the wicker
cone: tickling them with a grass seed head, pulling the grass backward
and forward between her toes where they were calloused from the thong on
her flip-flops. Jane was suffused with a sensation that was mingled
ecstasy and shame: shame because she hated her feet, prosaic flat slabs
that took an extra-wide fitting. Daniel’s feet (he had been barefoot
even when he was driving and in the shop—the shopkeeper had stared) were
brown and finely complex, high-arched with wire-taut tendons, curling
dark hairs tufting each toe.</p>
<p>“D’you think we’re layabouts and social parasites?” Paddy asked
her.</p>
<p>“I thought that perhaps you were students,” she said shyly. “I sort
of know the type, because my brother’s trying for Oxford.”</p>
<p>Daniel said that he’d rather not talk about Oxford. “His career there
hangs in the balance between brilliance and disaster,” Paddy explained
on his behalf. (Daniel’s senior tutor had warned that after certain
brushes with the drug squad he might not be allowed to sit his finals.)
“And he doesn’t know whether he cares.”</p>
<p>“I think we should swim,” Daniel suggested. “It’s just too fucking
hot.”</p>
<p>Jane blushed: his word was so forbidden that she hardly knew how she
knew it—the girls never used it at school. It was an entrance, glowering
with darkness, into the cave of things unknown to her.</p>
<p>“But I haven’t got a costume,” she said.</p>
<p>“Bo Peep’s lost her sheep,” Nigel mocked.</p>
<p>“Swim nude,” Daniel suggested. “No one can see—except us, and we like
you.”</p>
<p>She looked around at them all to see if they were joking, then drew
her breath in testingly as you did on the brink of plunging into water.
Inspired (and she had been sipping barley wine again, with her
sandwich), just then she was capable of anything. Tipping herself out of
the cone chair, she took hold of the hem of her dress, to pull it up
over her head while the boys watched. (It was as easy as playing with
Robin in the old days, she thought, in the garden with the paddling
pool.) She was aware uninhibitedly of her young body beneath the dress,
in its knickers and bra (she would keep those on, perhaps). But at that
very moment another girl appeared from inside the house, astonishing
them all: she came through the sliding doors, carrying a glass of
fizzing drink ceremoniously, stirring the ice cubes and sucking at it
through a plastic bendy straw. Slender and disdainful, with a long
narrow nose and slightly squinting eyes, she was wrapped in a sarong.
Her chestnut-dark hair fell well below her waist in symmetrical waves,
as if it had been tied in plaits and then undone.</p>
<p>“She can borrow my old swimsuit if she wants,” the girl said, with an
air of unmasking male proceedings beneath her dignity.</p>
<p>Nigel had leaped out of his chair, a suspended wicker basket, which
went swinging wildly. “Fiona! When did you get here? How did you get in?
What on earth are you drinking?”</p>
<p>“Vodka,” Fiona said. “And I got in while you were out, because you
actually failed to lock anything up behind you, you idiot. I mean, God,
Nige, what if I’d been a burglar or something? Then I was fast asleep,
until you lot started banging around down here. And this pool’s a
disgusting swamp—weren’t you supposed to do something about it? Hi,
Daniel and Paddy. Hi, what’s-your-name. My cozzy’s in a drawer in the
chest in my bedroom, if you want it.”</p>
<p>Fiona was Nigel’s younger sister, aged eighteen and returned by
herself from the South of France on her way to drama school. She chose
to sit with her drink under an orange umbrella at the far end of the
terrace, as if she were semidetached from her brother and his friends.
But Jane, with her new intuitiveness, guessed that she sat there because
it meant that she was in Daniel’s sight lines the whole time she was
yawning and stretching and pretending to sunbathe, showing off her legs
through the slit in her sarong.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Jane borrowed Fiona’s swimming costume (which was tight on her) and
powered up and down the short pool with her strong crawl, face turning
into the water then out to breathe, as she’d been taught, all the
accumulated rubbish (leathery wet leaves, sodden drowned butterflies and
daddy longlegs, an empty cigarette pack) bobbing against her breasts and
lips and knees as she swam. No one joined her in the pool. Jane had
hardly expected them to; she had accepted immediately the justice of her
defeat—right at the moment that she’d had all the boys’ eyes on her—by
the older, prettier, more sophisticated girl. (Still, the word
“woebegone” nudged at her, from a poem she’d read at school.) When she
got out, she would ask Paddy to drive her to a bus stop, then to lend
her the money for her bus fare home. She would ask for his address, so
that she could repay him: out of her pocket money, because she could
never tell her parents where she’d been.</p>
<p>Heaving herself out at the side of the pool, she stood streaming
water, too shy to ask for a towel. The others were planning a visit to
the pub in the nearest village. Jane had never been inside a pub in her
life, but she thought there was bound to be a bus stop somewhere in the
village.</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s go,” Fiona said impatiently. There was only half an
hour until afternoon closing time.</p>
<p>“We can’t all get in the car,” Nigel said, worrying.</p>
<p>“We can if we hold on tight. It’ll be a scream. Paddy, come on.”</p>
<p>Obediently, Paddy stood up, stuffing his book into his back pocket.
(It was Herman Hesse’s “Steppenwolf.”) He went to look for shoes. Fiona
was aware suddenly of Jane. “Oh, God, she’s still got that costume on.
Can’t you just put your dress on over the top?”</p>
<p>Jane looked down mutely at herself, still dripping.</p>
<p>Daniel hadn’t moved from where he was spread-eagled now in a deck
chair. He’d been watching Jane’s steady stroke in the pool, how she
submitted to the rhythm of it and forgot herself, forgot to wonder
whether they were looking at her or not. He had felt, while he watched,
that he was seeing deeply into her raw sensibility: fatalistic, acutely
responsive, open to anything. He was aware all the time, of course, of
Fiona’s maneuvering to make him notice her—there was a bit of past
history between them, which he was wary of reviving, not wanting her to
get it into her head that she had any rights of possession over him.
Anyway, her blasé, bossy voice was grating on him this afternoon. Her
displays of sophistication seemed childish, and he was unmoved by the
skinny brown stomach flashing at him so insistently from above the
sarong.</p>
<p>“You go ahead,” he said. “Jane has to change. I’ll wait and walk down
with her. We’ll catch up.”</p>
<p>Fiona couldn’t hide the sour disappointment in her face, but she had
staked too much, too noisily, on her desperate need for the pub to back
down now. Jane looked anxiously from one to the other. “I don’t mind,”
she said. “You don’t have to wait for me.”</p>
<p>“What are you up to, Daniel?” Fiona laughed ungraciously.</p>
<p>Daniel kept his eyes closed against the sun while the others
quarrelled, getting ready; Jane went inside to change. When he heard the
car receding on the road, he followed her in, confused at first in the
interior patchwork of light and shadows, after the glare outdoors. He
stood listening at the bottom of the open-tread staircase, his breath
barely stirring the bright dust motes in their circling. The house was
as perfectly quiet as if it were empty, yet he was aware of the girl
standing somewhere upstairs, equally still, listening for him. The
moment seemed eloquent, as he put his foot on the bottom step and
started up, breaking into the peace.</p>
<p>He found Jane in Fiona’s room, where she’d left her dress; she was
still in the wet costume, although she’d pulled down the blind out of
modesty, so that he saw her waiting in a pink half-light. (She’d been
afraid, suddenly, to be naked, in case he came looking for her.) His
mouth when he kissed her (her first-ever kiss) seemed scalding, because
her mouth was cold from the water and from fear. She was cold and clammy
all over. When Daniel tried to peel off the sodden swimming costume it
knotted itself around her in a rubbery clinging rope and she had to
help, rolling it and dragging at it. They left it where it lay when she
kicked it off, and its wetness soaked into Fiona’s red rug.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Fiona found the wet patch on her rug later and guessed immediately
(she had intuitions, too) the story behind it; she thought for one
outraged moment that they’d actually done it on her bed. But her bed was
intact—thank God for that, at least. Daniel must have taken Jane into
the spare room, where he and Paddy were staying. By now it was late
afternoon, and Jane was in a phone box in the village, ringing home.
(Nigel didn’t want them using the phone at the house, in case his
parents complained about the bill.) Daniel waited for her, not
interested in her difficulties over what to say. He was smoking, leaning
back against the phone box, head tilted to look up at the sky, which was
still immaculately blue, just beginning to pale. Even while Jane spoke
to her mother in the ordinary words that seemed to flow convincingly, as
if from her old self, her new self pressed her free palm on the
rectangle of thick glass against which, on the other side, Daniel in his
blue shirt was also miraculously pressed, oblivious of her touch. (And
she knew now the long brown nakedness of his back under the shirt, with
its ripple of vertebrae.) Forever afterward, the smell inside one of
those old red phone boxes—dank and mushroomy and faintly urinous—could
turn Jane’s heart over in erotic excitement.</p>
<p>Her mother’s mild voice was in her ear, incurious: they had begun to
wonder where she was. “I told Daddy you’d probably gone off to play
Ping-Pong somewhere.”</p>
<p>“I’m at Alison’s,” Jane said. “Alison Lefanu. You remember, from
Junior Orchestra? French horn. Can I stay the night? It doesn’t matter
about toothbrush and pajamas. Her mum says I can borrow them.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Allsop, blessedly vague, sent her love to Mrs. Lefanu. “The
Lefanus live out at Headley, don’t they? You didn’t walk all that
way?”</p>
<p>“I was on my way down to the village, and they drove past. I just got
in.”</p>
<p>Jane was thinking, Will I ever see my home again? It seemed
unlikely.</p>
<p>“Don’t be a nuisance,” her mother said. “Eat whatever they put in
front of you, even if it’s cauliflower.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Now they all sat talking on the terrace in an evening light as thick
as syrup; clouds of insects swarmed above the Japanese water features,
swallows slipped close along the earth, a blackbird sang. They were
drinking Jane’s shoplifted wine and her whiskey; then the boys started
messing around with a needle and little glass vials of methedrine, which
Paddy fetched from his room. “Don’t look, it’s not for nice girls,”
Daniel said to Jane, and so, obediently, she closed her eyes. The boys’
huddle over this ceremony—so intimate, taken so seriously—frightened
Fiona and made her even more furious than the wet patch on her rug. She
went inside and crashed around the house, effecting a transformation:
washing dishes, scrubbing the stove and the kitchen floor, throwing the
windows wide open, emptying ashtrays with a clang of the dustbin lid.
She shook out the mats from the sitting room, cracking them like whips
over the boys’ heads on the terrace. Gradually, as she worked, the
resentment slipped out of her and her mood changed. She began to enjoy
her own strength and to feel serenely indifferent to the others. If her
brother’s friends wanted to get doped up, why should she care? She
started to think about drama school. Later, she warmed up some tinned
soup, and brought out cheese and crackers for them all. By this time it
was dark and the only light came from the lamps she’d turned on
inside.</p>
<p>Daniel was trying to explain the idea of the soul as it was
understood in the Hindu Vedanta. His words were punctuated by the clonk
of the bamboo shishi-odoshi in the garden, which filled up with water
then tipped and emptied, falling back against its rock. What he wanted
to describe was how the soul’s origins were in wholeness and light, but
on its entry into the world it took on the filth of violence and
corruption. The soul trapped in the individual forgot its home and
despaired; but despair was only another illusion to be stripped away. He
wanted to say that revolution was a kind of cleansing that conferred its
own immortality in a perpetual present. Art had to be revolutionary or
it would die in time. He believed as he spoke that he was brilliantly
eloquent, but in truth he was rambling incoherently.</p>
<p>Paddy, getting the gist of it, quoted poetry in an ironic voice:
“ ‘Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter.’ ”</p>
<p>“Signor Keats, I do believe,” Nigel said.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s the poet,” Jane said. “We have his bust at home, on the
piano.”</p>
<p>Cross-legged on a cushion at Daniel’s feet, she was leaning lightly
against him, as if she could ground the tension quivering in his right
foot, which was balanced across his left knee. His intelligence seemed
as ceaseless as an engine working. She felt exceptionally attuned to the
boys’ voices rising through earnestness to mockery and back again,
although she hardly heard their words, only what ran underneath: a
current of strain, a jostling of contest and display. She saw how Nigel
tried to match the other two and failed, and how he suffered, yearning
for Daniel’s approval. Meanwhile, her own new knowledge filled her up,
not in the form of thoughts but as sensations, overwhelming. Her
experience in the strange bed that afternoon hadn’t been joyous: there’d
been some swooning, obliterating pleasure in the preliminaries, but then
too much anxiety in the clumsy arrangements, which she had known (from
her biology lessons) would follow. Remembering it all now, though, she
was sick with desire and longed for the time to come when Daniel would
touch her again.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>When they did go to bed, however, Daniel was suddenly exhausted;
stoop-backed, he crawled between the sheets in his underpants, turning
away from Jane, toward the window. “Watch over me” was the last thing he
mumbled.</p>
<p>And so she kept vigil faithfully for hours in the quiet of the night,
presiding over the mystery of her changed life, adjusting her body
against the peremptory curve of his turned back and legs in the narrow
single bed. But at last she couldn’t help it—she fell asleep herself.
And when she awoke in the morning Daniel was gone. After a while, when
he didn’t come back, she put on her underclothes and her dress, and set
off around the house in search of him. Downstairs, she smelled Paddy’s
sweat and saw the tousled mess of his hair, poking from the top of a
sleeping bag on the sofa in the lounge. Nigel was making a racket
outside with the sliding door of the garage, in search of the net for
the swimming pool. Jane climbed upstairs again. Nigel’s parents’ bedroom
was at the front of the house, opening off the landing ahead of her; the
door was ajar, and Jane stepped soundlessly inside.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful room, like nothing she’d ever seen before, with a
pale wood floor and plain white walls, creamy sheepskin rugs. Fresh
sunlight, pouring through windows all along its length, was reflected in
the mirrored doors of the built-in wardrobes; the curtains, in some kind
of rough white translucent linen, were cut too long for the windows, and
the cloth fell in heaps on the floor. A huge bed seemed to be all white
sheets and no blankets. (Jane had never seen a duvet before.) In the
bed, with the duvet kicked to their feet, Daniel and Fiona lay naked and
asleep, facing away from each other, their slim tanned legs tangled
together. Jane, who had done the Greeks in history, thought that they
looked like young warriors in a classical scene, fallen in the place
where they had been wrestling. She withdrew from the room without waking
them, as quietly as she had come in.</p>
<p>Nigel, rather the worse for wear, in his pajama bottoms, was smoking
and skimming the pool, dumping the rubbish in a soaking heap beside him.
He watched when Jane came to stand at the pool’s brink; she stared in
with dry, hot eyes.</p>
<p>“So now you know,” he said.</p>
<p>But she repudiated his offer of companionship in her unrequited love.
Her experience was not like anyone else’s. She asked only if he would
drive her home, and he said he’d get the car out as soon as he’d
finished with the pool.</p>
<p>“I’d like to go now,” she said crisply, sounding like her mother. “If
you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>On the way back, they hardly spoke, except when Nigel asked for
directions as they drew near the house. Jane forgot, in her absorption,
to notice the way they’d come, so that she never afterward knew where
she’d been. And she never saw Nigel’s house again, or any of the boys
(Fiona once, perhaps, at a party).</p>
<p>He dropped her off at the bottom of the drive. It was still quite
early in the morning—only nine o’clock. Jane stared around her as if
she’d never seen the place before, as if it were more mysterious than
anywhere she’d been—the scuffed dirt at the edge of the road, the old
mossy gateposts, blackbirds flitting in the dead leaves at the bottom of
the hedge, the hard lime-yellow fruits in the hedge apple tree, her own
footprints from the day before intact in the dust, the Jokari paddle
left where she had dropped it.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Her mother didn’t seem surprised to see her so early.</p>
<p>“Did you have a nice time, dear?”</p>
<p>Jane said that she’d had fun. But that afternoon she suffered with
pain in her stomach and bloating (“What exactly did you eat at the
Lefanus?”). And the next day her period came rather copiously and
early—which ought to have been a relief but wasn’t, because it hadn’t
occurred to her until then (despite the biology lessons) that she could
be pregnant. The weather changed, too. So it was all right for her to
curl up under her eiderdown, hugging a hot-water bottle to her stomach,
reading her Chalet School books and looking up from time to time at the
rain running down the window. Her mother brought her tea with two
sugars, and aspirin.</p>
<p>Jane never told anyone what had happened to her (not even, years
later, the boyfriend who became her husband, and who might have
wondered). And in a way she never assimilated the experience, though she
didn’t forget it, either. As an adult, she took on board all the usual
Tory disapproval toward drugs and juvenile delinquency and underage sex,
and never saw any implications for her own case. She was fearful for her
own daughters, as normal mothers were, without connecting her fears to
anything that had happened to her. Her early initiation stayed in a
sealed compartment in her thoughts and seemed to have no effects, no
consequences.</p>
<p>Jane and her husband divorced in their mid-fifties, and her friends
advised her to have counselling. The counsellor was a nice, intelligent
woman. (Actually, she couldn’t help feeling exasperated by Jane and her
heavy, patient sorrows: her expensive clothes, her lack of imagination,
the silk scarf thrown girlishly over one shoulder. Of course, she was
much too professional to let this show.) Jane confessed that she had
always felt as if she were on the wrong side of a barrier, cutting her
off from the real life she was meant to be living.</p>
<p>“What’s it like, then, real life on the other side?”</p>
<p>Haltingly, Jane described a summer day beside a swimming pool. A long
sunlit room with white walls and a white bed. A breeze is blowing; long
white curtains are dragged sluggishly backward and forward on a pale
wood floor. (These women’s fantasies, the counsellor thought, have more
to do with interior décor than with repressed desires.) Then Jane got
into her stride, and the narrative became more interesting. “A boy and a
girl,” she said, “are naked, asleep in the bed. I am curled on a rug on
the floor beside them. The boy turns over in his sleep, flings out his
arm, and his hand dangles to the floor. I think he’s seeking out the
cool, down there under the bed. I move carefully on my rug, so as not to
wake him. I move so that his hand is touching me.”</p>
<p>That’s more like it, the counsellor thought. That’s something.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>As for Daniel, well, he trained as a lawyer after he’d finished his
literature degree. He got out of the drink and the drugs not long after
university. (Paddy never did; he died.) Daniel lives in Zurich now, with
his second wife, whom he loves very much, and occasionally, when he’s
bored with his respectable Swiss friends and wants to shock them, he
tells stories about his wild youth. He is in international human-rights
law; he’s a force for good. He’s a good husband and father, too (more
dedicated, because of the wildness in his past). Of course, he’s
ambitious and likes power.</p>
<p>He can just about remember Nigel, and Nigel’s parents’ house that
summer, and Fiona (they were together off and on for a few months
afterward). But he has no memory at all of Jane. Even if by some miracle
he ever met her, and she recognized him and told him the whole story
(which she would never do), it wouldn’t bring anything back. It isn’t
only that the drink and the drugs made him forget. He’s had too much
happiness in his life since, too much experience; he’s lost that
fine-tuning that could hold on to the smell of the ham in the
off-license, the wetness of the swimming costume, the girl’s cold skin
and her naïveté, her extraordinary offer of herself without reserve, the
curtains sweeping the floor in the morning light. It’s all just
gone.</p>
