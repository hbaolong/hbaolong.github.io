<h4 id="the-pugilist-at-rest">The Pugilist at Rest</h4>
<p>By Thom Jones (1991)</p>
<p>Hey Baby got caught writing a letter to his girl when he was supposed
to be taking notes on the specs of the M-14 rifle. We were sitting in a
stifling hot Quonset hut during the first weeks of boot camp, August,
1966, at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego. Sergeant Wright
snatched the letter out of Hey Baby’s hand, and later that night in the
squad bay he read the letter to the Marine recruits of Platoon 263, his
voice laden with sarcasm. “Hey, Baby!” he began, and then as he went
into the body of the letter he worked himself into a state of outrage
and disgust. It was a letter to Rosie Rottencrotch, he said at the end,
and what really mattered, what was really at issue and what was of utter
importance was not Rosie Rottencrotch and her steaming-hot panties but
rather the muzzle velocity of the M-14 rifle.</p>
<p>Hey Baby paid for the letter by doing a hundred squat thrusts on the
concrete floor of the squad bay, but the main prize he won that night
was that he became forever known as Hey Baby to the recruits of Platoon
263—in addition to being a shitbird, a faggot, a turd, a maggot, and
other such standard appellations. To top it all off, shortly after the
incident, Hey Baby got a Dear John from this girl back in Chicago, of
whom Sergeant Wright, myself, and seventy-eight other Marine recruits
had come to know just a little.</p>
<p>Hey Baby was not in the Marine Corps for very long. The reason for
this was that he started in on my buddy, Jorgeson. Jorgeson was my main
man, and Hey Baby started calling him Jorgepussy and began harassing him
and pushing him around. He was down on Jorgeson because whenever we were
taught some sort of combat maneuver or tactic, Jorgeson would say, under
his breath, “You could get killed if you try that.” Or, “Your ass is
had, if you do that.” You got the feeling that Jorgeson didn’t think
loving the American flag and defending democratic ideals in Southeast
Asia were all that important. He told me that what he really wanted to
do was have an artist’s loft in the SoHo district of New York City, wear
a beret, eat liver-sausage sandwiches made with stale baguettes, drink
Tokay wine, smoke dope, paint pictures, and listen to the wailing,
sorrowful songs of that French singer Edith Piaf, otherwise known as
“The Little Sparrow.”</p>
<p>After the first half hour of boot camp most of the other recruits
wanted to get out, too, but they nourished dreams of surfboards,
Corvettes, and blond babes. Jorgeson wanted to be a beatnik and hang out
with Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady, slam down burning shots of amber
whiskey, and hear Charles Mingus play real cool jazz on the bass fiddle.
He wanted to practice Zen Buddhism, throw the I Ching, eat couscous, and
study astrology charts. All of this was foreign territory to me. I had
grown up in Aurora, Illinois, and had never heard of such things.
Jorgeson had a sharp tongue and was so supercilious in his remarks that
I didn’t know quite how seriously I should take this talk, but I enjoyed
his humor and I did believe he had the sensibilities of an artist. It
was not some vague yearning. I believed very much that he could become a
painter of pictures. At that point he wasn’t putting his heart and soul
into becoming a Marine. He wasn’t a true believer like me.</p>
<p>Some weeks after Hey Baby began hassling Jorgeson, Sergeant Wright
gave us his best speech: “You men are going off to war, and it’s not a
pretty thing,” etc. andandandand etc., “and if Luke the Gook knocks down
one of your buddies, a fellow-Marine, you are going to risk your life
and go in and get that Marine and you are going to bring him out. Not
because I said so. No! You are going after that Marine because you are a
Marine, a member of the most élite fighting force in the world, and that
man out there who’s gone down is a Marine, and he’s your buddy. He is
your brother! Once you are a Marine, you are always a Marine and you
will never let another Marine down.” Etc. andandandand etc. “You can
take a Marine out of the Corps but you can’t take the Corps out of a
Marine.” Etc. andandandand etc. At the time it seemed to me a very good
speech, and it stirred me deeply. Sergeant Wright was no candy ass. He
was one squared-away dude, and he could call cadence. Man, it puts a
lump in my throat when I remember how that man could sing cadence. Apart
from Jorgeson, I think all of the recruits in Platoon 263 were proud of
Sergeant Wright. He was the real thing, the genuine article. He was a
crackerjack Marine.</p>
<p>In the course of training, lots of the recruits dropped out of the
original platoon. Some couldn’t pass the physical-fitness tests and had
to go to a special camp for pussies. This was a particularly shameful
shortcoming, the most humiliating apart from bed-wetting. Other recruits
would get pneumonia, strep throat, infected foot blisters, or whatever,
and lose time that way. Some didn’t qualify at the rifle range. One
would break a leg. Another would have a nervous breakdown (and this was
also deplorable). People dropped out right and left. When the recruit
corrected whatever deficiency he had, or when he got better, he would be
picked up by another platoon that was in the stage of basic training
that he had been in when his training was interrupted. Platoon 263
picked up dozens of recruits in this fashion. If everything went well,
however, you got through with the whole business in twelve weeks. That’s
not a long time, but it seemed like a long time. You did not see a
female in all that time. You did not see a newspaper or a television
set. You did not eat a candy bar. Another thing was the fact that you
had someone on top of you, watching every move you made. When it was
time to “shit, shower, and shave,” you were given just ten minutes, and
had to confront lines and so on to complete the entire affair. Head
calls were so infrequent that I spent a lot of time that might otherwise
have been neutral or painless in the eye-watering anxiety that I was
going to piss my pants. We ran to chow, where we were faced with
enormous steam vents that spewed out a sickening smell of rancid,
superheated grease. Still, we entered the mess hall with ravenous
appetites, ate a huge tray of food in just a few minutes, and then ran
back to our company area in formation, choking back the burning bile of
a meal too big to be eaten so fast. God forbid that you would lose
control and vomit.</p>
<p>If all had gone well in the preceding hours, Sergeant Wright would
permit us to smoke one cigarette after each meal. Jorgeson had shown me
the wisdom of switching from Camels to Pall Malls—they were much longer,
packed a pretty good jolt, and when we snapped open our brushed-chrome
Zippos, torched up, and inhaled the first few drags, we shared the
overmastering pleasure that tobacco can bring if you use it seldom and
judiciously. These were always the best moments of the day—brief
respites from the tyrannical repression of recruit training. As we got
close to the end of it all Jorgeson liked to play a little game. He used
to say to me (with fragrant blue smoke curling out of his nostrils), “If
someone said, ‘I’ll give you ten thousand dollars to do all of this
again,’ what would you say?” “No way, Jack!” He would keep on upping it
until he had John Beresford Tipton, the guy from “The Millionaire,”
offering me a check for a million bucks. “Not for any money,” I’d
say.</p>
<p>While they were all smoldering under various pressures, the recruits
were also getting pretty “salty”—they were beginning to believe. They
were beginning to think of themselves as Marines. If you could make it
through this, the reasoning went, you wouldn’t crack in combat. So I
remember that I had tears in my eyes when Sergeant Wright gave us the
spiel about how a Marine would charge a machine-gun nest to save his
buddies, dive on a hand grenade, do whatever it takes—and yet I was
ashamed when Jorgeson caught me wiping them away. All of the recruits
were teary except Jorgeson. He had these very clear cobalt-blue eyes.
They were so remarkable that they caused you to notice Jorgeson in a
crowd. There was unusual beauty in these eyes, and there was an
extraordinary power in them. Apart from having a pleasant enough face,
Jorgeson was small and unassuming except for these eyes. Anyhow, when he
caught me getting sentimental he gave me this look that penetrated to
the core of my being. It was the icy look of absolute contempt, and it
caused me to doubt myself. I said, “Man! Can’t you get into it? For
Christ’s sake!”</p>
<p>“I’m not like you,” he said. “But I am into it, more than you could
ever know. I never told you this before, but I am Kal-El, born on the
planet Krypton and rocketed to Earth as an infant, moments before my
world exploded. Disguised as a mild-mannered Marine, I have resolved to
use my powers for the good of mankind. Whenever danger appears on the
scene, truth and justice will be served as I slip into the green
U.S.M.C. utility uniform and become Earth’s greatest hero.”</p>
<p>I got highly pissed and didn’t talk to him for a couple of days after
this. Then, about two weeks before boot camp was over, when we were
running out to the parade field for drill with our rifles at port arms,
all assholes and elbows, I saw Hey Baby give Jorgeson a nasty shove with
his M-14. Hey Baby was a large and fairly tough young man who liked to
displace his aggressive impulses on Jorgeson, but he wasn’t as big or as
tough as I.</p>
<p>Jorgeson nearly fell down as the other recruits scrambled out to the
parade field, and Hey Baby gave a short, malicious laugh. I ran past
Jorgeson and caught up to Hey Baby; he picked me up in his peripheral
vision, but by then it was too late. I set my body so that I could put
everything into it, and with one deft stroke I hammered him in the
temple with the sharp edge of the steel butt plate of my M-14. It was
not exactly a premeditated crime, although I had been laying to get him.
My idea before this had simply been to lay my hands on him, but now I
had blood in my eye. I was a skilled boxer, and I knew the temple was a
vulnerable spot; the human skull is otherwise hard and durable, except
at its base. There was a sickening crunch, and Hey Baby dropped into the
ice plants along the side of the company street.</p>
<p>The entire platoon was out on the parade field when the house mouse
screamed at the assistant D.I., who rushed back to the scene of the
crime to find Hey Baby crumpled in a fetal position in the ice plants
with blood all over the place. There was blood from the scalp wound as
well as a froth of blood emitting from his nostrils and his mouth. Blood
was leaking from his right ear. Did I see skull fragments and brain
tissue? It seemed that I did. To tell you the truth, I wouldn’t have
cared in the least if I had killed him, but like most criminals I was
very much afraid of getting caught. It suddenly occurred to me that I
could be headed for the brig for a long time. My heart was pounding out
of my chest. Yet the larger part of me didn’t care. Jorgeson was my
buddy, and I wasn’t going to stand still and let someone fuck him
over.</p>
<p>The platoon waited at parade rest while Sergeant Wright came out of
the duty hut and took command of the situation. An ambulance was called,
and it came almost immediately. A number of corpsmen squatted down
alongside the fallen man for what seemed an eternity. Eventually they
took Hey Baby off with a fractured skull. It would be the last we ever
saw of him. Three evenings later, in the squad bay, the assistant D.I.
told us rather ominously that Hey Baby had recovered consciousness.
That’s all he said. What did that mean? I was worried, because Hey Baby
had seen me make my move, but, as it turned out, when he came to he had
forgotten the incident and all events of the preceding two weeks.
Retrograde amnesia. Lucky for me. I also knew that at least three other
recruits had seen what I did, but none of them reported me. Every member
of the platoon was called in and grilled by a team of hard-ass captains
and a light colonel from the Criminal Investigation Detachment. It took
a certain amount of balls to lie to them, yet none of my fellow-jarheads
reported me. I was well liked and Hey Baby was not. Indeed, many felt
that he got exactly what was coming to him.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The other day—Memorial Day, as it happened—I was cleaning some stuff
out of the attic when I came upon my old dress-blue uniform. It’s a
beautiful uniform, easily the most handsome worn by any of the U.S.
armed forces. The rich color recalled Jorgeson’s eyes for me—not that
the color matched, but in the sense that the color of each was so
startling. The tunic does not have lapels, of course, but a high collar
with red piping and the traditional golden eagle, globe, and anchor
insignia on either side of the neck clasp. The tunic buttons are not
brassy—although they are in fact made of brass—but are a delicate gold
in color, like Florentine gold. On the sleeves of the tunic my
staff-sergeant’s chevrons are gold on red. High on the left breast is a
rainbow display of fruit salad representing my various combat citations.
Just below these are my marksmanship badges; I shot Expert in rifle as
well as pistol.</p>
<p>I opened a sandalwood box and took my various medals out of the large
plastic bag I had packed them in to prevent them from tarnishing. The
Navy Cross and the two Silver Stars are the best; they are such pretty
things they dazzle you. I found a couple of Thai sticks in the
sandalwood box as well. I took a whiff of the box and smelled the smells
of Saigon—the whores, the dope, the saffron, cloves, jasmine, and
patchouli oil. I put the Thai sticks back, recalling the three-day
hangover that particular batch of dope had given me more than
twenty-three years before. Again I looked at my dress-blue tunic. My
most distinctive badge, the crowning glory, and the one of which I am
most proud, is the set of Airborne wings. I remember how it was, walking
around Oceanside, California—the Airborne wings and the high-and-tight
haircut were recognized by all the Marines; they meant you were the
crème de la crème, you were a recon Marine.</p>
<p>Recon was all Jorgeson’s idea. We had lost touch with each other
after boot camp. I was sent to com school in San Diego, where I had to
sit in a hot Class A wool uniform all day and learn the Morse code. I
deliberately flunked out, and when I was given the perfunctory option
for a second shot, I told the colonel, “Hell no, sir. I want to go
003—infantry. I want to be a ground-pounder. I didn’t join the service
to sit at a desk all day.”</p>
<p>I was on a bus to Camp Pendleton three days later, and when I got
there I ran into Jorgeson. I had been thinking of him a lot. He was a
clerk in headquarters company. Much to my astonishment, he was fifteen
pounds heavier, and had grown two inches, and he told me he was hitting
the weight pile every night after running seven miles up and down the
foothills of Pendleton in combat boots, carrying a rifle and a full
field pack. After the usual what’s-been-happening? b.s., he got down to
business and said, “They need people in Force Recon, what do you think?
Headquarters is one boring motherfucker.”</p>
<p>I said, “Recon? Paratrooper? You got to be shittin’ me! When did you
get so gung-ho, man?”</p>
<p>He said, “Hey, you were the one who bought the program. Don’t fade on
me now, God damn it! Look, we pass the physical fitness test and then
they send us to jump school at Benning. If we pass that, we’re in. And
we’ll pass. Those doggies ain’t got jack. Semper fi, motherfucker! Let’s
do it.”</p>
<p>There was no more talk of Neal Cassady, Edith Piaf, or the artist’s
loft in SoHo. I said, “If Sergeant Wright could only see you now!”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>We were just three days in country when we got dropped in somewhere
in the western highlands of the Quang Tri province. It was a routine
reconnaissance patrol. It was not supposed to be any kind of big deal at
all—just acclimation. The morning after our drop we approached a clear
field. I recall that it gave me a funny feeling, but I was too new to
fully trust my instincts. Everything was spooky; I was fresh meat,
F.N.G.—a Fucking New Guy.</p>
<p>Before moving into the field, our team leader sent Hanes—a lance
corporal, a short-timer, with only twelve days left before his rotation
was over—across the field as a point man. This was a bad omen and
everyone knew it. Hanes had two Purple Hearts. He followed the order
with no hesitation and crossed the field without drawing fire. The team
leader signalled for us to fan out and told me to circumvent the field
and hump through the jungle to investigate a small mound of loose red
dirt that I had missed completely but that he had picked up with his
trained eye. I remember I kept saying, “Where?” He pointed to a heap of
earth about thirty yards along the tree line and about ten feet back in
the bushes. Most likely it was an anthill, but you never knew—it could
have been an N.V.A. tunnel. “Over there,” he hissed. “God damn it, do I
have to draw pictures for you?”</p>
<p>I moved smartly in the direction of the mound while the rest of the
team reconverged to discuss something. As I approached the mound I saw
that it was in fact an anthill, and I looked back at the team and saw
they were already halfway across the field, moving very fast.</p>
<p>Suddenly there were several loud hollow pops and the cry “Incoming!”
Seconds later the first of a half-dozen mortar rounds landed in the
loose earth surrounding the anthill. For a millisecond, everything went
black. I was blown back and lifted up on a cushion of warm air. At first
it was like the thrill of a carnival ride, but it was quickly followed
by that stunned, jangly, electric feeling you get when you hit your
crazy bone. Like that, but not confined to a small area like the elbow.
I felt it shoot through my spine and into all four limbs. A thick
plaster of sand and red clay plugged up my nostrils and ears. Grit was
blown in between my teeth. If I hadn’t been wearing a pair of Ray-Ban
aviator shades, I would certainly have been blinded permanently—as it
was, my eyes were loaded with grit. (I later discovered that fine red
earth was somehow blown in behind the crystal of my pressure-tested
Rolex Submariner, underneath my fingernails and toenails, and deep into
the pores of my skin.) When I was able to, I pulled out a canteen filled
with lemon-lime Kool-Aid and tried to flood my eyes clean. This helped a
little, but my eyes still felt like they were on fire. I rinsed them
again and blinked furiously.</p>
<p>I rolled over on my stomach in the prone position and levelled my
field-issue M-16. A company of screaming N.V.A. soldiers ran into the
field, firing as they came—I saw their green tracer rounds blanket the
position where the team had quickly congregated to lay out a perimeter,
but none of our own red tracers were going out. Several of the Marines
had been killed outright by the mortar rounds. Jorgeson was all right,
and I saw him cast a nervous glance in my direction. Then he turned to
the enemy and began to fire his M-16. I clicked my rifle on to automatic
and pulled the trigger, but the gun was loaded with dirt and it wouldn’t
fire.</p>
<p>Apart from Jorgeson, the only other American putting out any fire was
Second Lieutenant Milton, also a fairly new guy, a “cherry,” who was
down on one knee firing his .45, an exercise in almost complete
futility. I assumed that Milton’s 16 had jammed, like mine, and watched
as AK-47 rounds, having penetrated his flak jacket and then his chest,
ripped through the back of his field pack and buzzed into the jungle
beyond like a deadly swarm of bees. A few seconds later, I heard the
swoosh of an R.P.G. rocket, a dud round that dinged the lieutenant’s
left shoulder before it flew off in the bush behind him. It took off his
whole arm, and for an instant I could see the white bone and ligaments
of his shoulder, and the red flesh of muscle tissue, looking very much
like fresh prime beef, well marbled and encased in a thin layer of
yellowish-white adipose tissue that quickly became saturated with
dark-red blood. What a lot of blood there was. Still, Milton continued
to fire his .45. When he emptied his clip, I watched him remove a fresh
one from his web gear and attempt to load the pistol with one hand. He
seemed to fumble with the fresh clip for a long time, until at last he
dropped it, along with his .45. The lieutenant’s head slowly sagged
forward, but he stayed up on one knee with his remaining arm extended
out to the enemy, palm upward in the soulful, heartrending gesture of Al
Jolson doing a rendition of “Mammy.”</p>
<p>A hail of green tracer rounds buzzed past Jorgeson, but he coolly
returned fire in short, controlled bursts. The light, tinny pops from
his M-16 did not sound very reassuring, but I saw several N.V.A. go
down. AK-47 fire kicked up red dust all around Jorgeson’s feet. He was
basically out in the open, and if ever a man was totally alone it was
Jorgeson. He was dead meat and he had to know it. It was very strange
that he wasn’t hit immediately.</p>
<p>Jorgeson zigged his way over to the body of a large black Marine who
carried an M-60 machine gun. Most of the recon Marines carried grease
guns or Swedish Ks; an M-60 was too heavy for travelling light and fast,
but this Marine had been big and he had been paranoid. I had known him
least of anyone in the squad. In three days he had said nothing to me, I
suppose because I was F.N.G., and had spooked him. Indeed, now he was
dead. That august seeker of truth, Schopenhauer, was correct: We are
like lambs in a field, disporting themselves under the eye of the
butcher, who chooses out first one and then another for his prey. So it
is that in our good days we are all unconscious of the evil Fate may
have presently in store for us—sickness, poverty, mutilation, loss of
sight or reason.</p>
<p>It was difficult to judge how quickly time was moving. Although my
senses had been stunned by the concussion of the mortar rounds, they
were, however paradoxical this may seem, more acute than ever before. I
watched Jorgeson pick up the machine gun and begin to spread an
impressive field of fire back at the enemy. Thuk thuk thuk, thuk thuk
thuk, thuk thuk thuk! I saw several more bodies fall, and began to think
that things might turn out all right after all. The N.V.A. dropped for
cover, and many of them turned back and headed for the tree line.
Jorgeson fired off a couple of bandoliers, and after he stopped to load
another, he turned back and looked at me with those blue eyes and a
smile like “How am I doing?” Then I heard the steel-cork pop of an M-79
launcher and saw a rocket grenade explode through Jorgeson’s upper
abdomen, causing him to do something like a back flip. His M-60 machine
gun flew straight up into the air. The barrel was glowing red like a hot
poker, and continued to fire in a “cook off” until the entire bandolier
had run through.</p>
<p>In the meantime I had pulled a cleaning rod out of my pack and worked
it through the barrel of my M-16. When I next tried to shoot, the
Tonka-toy son of a bitch remained jammed, and at last I frantically
broke it down to find the source of the problem. I had a dirty bolt.
Fucking dirt everywhere. With numbed fingers I removed the firing pin
and worked it over with a toothbrush, dropping it in the red dirt,
picking it up, cleaning it, and dropping it again. My fingers felt like
Novocain, and while I could see far away, I was unable to see up close.
I poured some more Kool-Aid over my eyes. It was impossible for me to
get my weapon clean. Lucky for me, ultimately.</p>
<p>Suddenly N.V.A. soldiers were running through the field shoving
bayonets into the bodies of the downed Marines. It was not until an
N.V.A. trooper kicked Lieutenant Milton out of his tripod position that
he finally fell to the ground. Then the soldiers started going through
the dead Marines’ gear. I was still frantically struggling with my
weapon when it began to dawn on me that the enemy had forgotten me in
the excitement of the firefight. I wondered what had happened to Hanes
and if he had gotten clear. I doubted it, and hopped on my survival
radio to call in an air strike when finally a canny N.V.A. trooper did
remember me and headed in my direction most ricky-tick.</p>
<p>With a tight grip on the spoon, I pulled the pin on a fragmentation
grenade and then unsheathed my K-bar. About this time Jorgeson let off a
horrendous shriek—a gut shot is worse than anything. Or did Jorgeson
scream to save my life? The N.V.A. moving in my direction turned back to
him, studied him for a moment, and then thrust a bayonet into his heart.
As badly as my own eyes hurt, I was able to see Jorgeson’s eyes—a final
flash of glorious azure before they faded into the unfocussed and glazed
gray of death. I repinned the grenade, got up on my knees, and scrambled
away until finally I was on my feet with a useless and incomplete
handful of M-16 parts, and I was running as fast and as hard as I have
ever run in my life. A pair of Phantom F-4s came in very low with
delayed-action high-explosive rounds and napalm. I could feel the almost
unbearable heat waves of the latter, volley after volley. I can still
feel it and smell it to this day.</p>
<p>Concerning Lance Corporal Hanes: they found him later, fried to a
crisp by the napalm, but it was nonetheless ascertained that he had been
mutilated while alive. He was like the rest of us—eighteen, nineteen,
twenty years old. What did we know of life? Before Vietnam, Hanes didn’t
think he would ever die. I mean, yes, he knew that in theory he would
die, but he felt like he was going to live forever. I know that I felt
that way. Hanes was down to twelve days and a wake-up. When other
Marines saw a short-timer get greased, it devastated their morale.
However, when I saw them zip up the body bag on Hanes I became incensed.
Why hadn’t Milton sent him back to the rear to burn shit or something
when he got so short? Twelve days to go and then mutilated. Fucking
Milton! Fucking Second Lieutenant!</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Theogenes was the greatest of gladiators. He was a boxer who served
under the patronage of a cruel nobleman, a prince who took great delight
in bloody spectacles. Although this was several hundred years before the
times of those most enlightened of men, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle,
and well after the Minoans of Crete, it still remains a high point in
the history of Western civilization and culture. It was the approximate
time of Homer, the greatest poet who ever lived. Then, as now, violence,
suffering, and the cheapness of life were the rule.</p>
<p>The sort of boxing Theogenes practiced was not like modern-day boxing
with those kindergarten Queensberry Rules. The two contestants were not
permitted the freedom of a ring. Instead, they were strapped to flat
stones, facing each other nose-to-nose. When the signal was given they
would begin hammering each other with fists encased in heavy leather
thongs. It was a fight to the death. Fourteen hundred and twenty-five
times Theogenes was strapped to the stone and fourteen hundred and
twenty-five times he emerged a victor.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is Theogenes who is depicted in the famous Roman statue
(based on the earlier Greek original) of “The Pugilist at Rest.” I keep
a grainy black-and-white photograph of it in my room. The statue depicts
a muscular athlete approaching his middle age. He has a thick beard and
a full head of curly hair. In addition to the telltale broken nose and
cauliflower ears of a boxer, the pugilist has the slanted, drooping
brows that bespeak torn nerves. Also, the forehead is piled with scar
tissue. As may be expected, the pugilist has the musculature of a
fighter. His neck and trapezius muscles are well developed. His
shoulders are enormous; his chest is thick and flat, without the bulging
pectorals of the bodybuilder. His back, oblique, and abdominal muscles
are highly pronounced, and he has that greatest asset of the modern
boxer—sturdy legs. The arms are large, particularly the forearms, which
are reinforced with the leather wrappings of the cestus. It is the body
of a small heavyweight—lithe rather than bulky, but by no means lacking
in power: a Jack Johnson or a Dempsey, say. If you see the authentic
statue at the Terme Museum, in Rome, you will see that the seated boxer
is really not much more than a light heavyweight. People were small in
those days. The important thing was that he was perfectly
proportioned.</p>
<p>The pugilist is sitting on a rock with his forearms balanced on his
thighs. That he is seated and not pacing implies that he has been
through all this many times before. It appears that he is conserving his
strength. His head is turned as if he were looking over his shoulder—as
if someone had just whispered something to him. It is in this that the
“art” of the sculpture is conveyed to the viewer. Could it be that
someone has just summoned him to the arena? There is a slight look of
befuddlement on his face, but there is no trace of fear. There is an air
about him that suggests that he is eager to proceed and does not wish to
cause anyone any trouble or to create a delay, even though his life will
soon be on the line. Besides the deformities on his noble face, there is
also the suggestion of weariness and philosophical resignation. All the
world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players. Exactly! He
knew this more than two thousand years before Shakespeare penned the
line. How did he come to be at this place in space and time? Would he
rather be safely removed to the countryside—an obscure, stinking peasant
shoving a plow behind a mule? Would that be better? Or does he revel in
his role? Perhaps he once did, but surely not now. Is this the great
Theogenes or merely a journeyman fighter, a former slave or criminal
bought by one of the many contractors who for months trained the
condemned for their brief moment in the arena? I wonder if Marcus
Aurelius loved the “Pugilist” as I do, and came to study it and to
meditate before it?</p>
<p>I cut and ran from that field in Southeast Asia. I’ve read that Davy
Crockett, hero of the American frontier, was cowering under a bed when
Santa Anna and his soldiers stormed into the Alamo. What is the truth?
Jack Dempsey used to get so scared before his fights that he sometimes
wet his pants. But look what he did to Willard and to Luis Firpo, the
Wild Bull of the Pampas! It was something close to homicide. What is
courage? What is cowardice? The magnificent Roberto Duran gave us “No
más,” but who had a greater fighting heart than Duran?</p>
<p>I got over that first scare and saw that I was something quite other
than that which I had known myself to be. Hey Baby proved only my
warm-up act. There was a reservoir of malice, poison, and vicious sadism
in my soul, and it poured forth freely in the jungles and rice paddies
of Vietnam. I pulled three tours. I wanted some payback for Jorgeson. I
grieved for Lance Corporal Hanes. I grieved for myself and what I had
lost. I committed unspeakable crimes and got medals for it.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>It was only fair that I got a head injury myself. I never got a
scratch in Vietnam, but I got tagged in a boxing smoker at Pendleton.
Fought a bad-ass light heavyweight from artillery. Nobody would fight
this guy. He could box. He had all the moves. But mainly he was a
puncher—it was said that he could punch with either hand. It was said
that his hand speed was superb. I had finished off at least a half rack
of Hamm’s before I went in with him and started getting hit with head
shots I didn’t even see coming. They were right. His hand speed was
superb.</p>
<p>I was twenty-seven years old, smoked two packs a day, was a
borderline alcoholic. I shouldn’t have fought him—I knew that—but he had
been making noise. A very long time before, I had been the middleweight
champion of the 1st Marine Division. I had been a so-called war hero. I
had been a recon Marine. But now I was a garrison Marine and in no kind
of shape.</p>
<p>He put me down almost immediately, and when I got up I was terribly
afraid. I was tight and I could not breathe. It felt like he was hitting
me in the face with a ball-peen hammer. It felt like he was busting
light bulbs in my face. Rather than one opponent, I saw three. I was
convinced his gloves were loaded, and a wave of self-pity ran through
me.</p>
<p>I began to move. He made a mistake by expending a lot of energy
trying to put me away quickly. I had no intention of going down again,
and I knew I wouldn’t. My buddies were watching, and I had to give them
a good show. While I was afraid, I was also exhilarated; I had not felt
this alive since Vietnam. I began to score with my left jab, and because
of this I was able to withstand his bull charges and divert them. I
thought he would throw his bolt, but in the beginning he was tireless. I
must have hit him with four hundred left jabs. It got so that I could
score at will, with either hand, but he would counter, trap me on the
ropes, and pound. He was the better puncher and was truly hurting me,
but I was scoring, and as the fight went on the momentum shifted and I
took over. I staggered him again and again. The Marines at ringside were
screaming for me to put him away, but however much I tried, I could not.
Although I could barely stand by the end, I was sorry that the fight was
over. Who had won? The referee raised my arm in victory, but I think it
was pretty much a draw. Judging a prizefight is a very subjective
thing.</p>
<p>About an hour after the bout, when the adrenaline had subsided, I
realized I had a terrible headache. It kept getting worse, and I rushed
out of the N.C.O. Club, where I had gone with my buddies to get
loaded.</p>
<p>I stumbled outside, struggling to breathe, and I headed away from the
company area toward Sheepshit Hill, one of the many low brown foothills
in the vicinity. Like a dog who wants to die alone, so it was with me.
Everything got swirly, and I dropped in the bushes.</p>
<p>I was unconscious for nearly an hour, and for the next two weeks I
walked around like I was drunk, with double vision. I had constant
headaches and seemed to have grown old overnight. My health was
gone.</p>
<p>I became a very timid individual. I became introspective. I wondered
what had made me act the way I had acted. Why had I killed my fellow-men
in war, without any feeling, remorse, or regret? And when the war was
over, why did I continue to drink and swagger around and get into
fistfights? Why did I like to dish out pain, and why did I take positive
delight in the suffering of others? Was I insane? Was it too much
testosterone? Women don’t do things like that. The rapacious Will to
Power lost its hold on me. Suddenly I began to feel sympathetic to the
cares and sufferings of all living creatures. You lose your health and
you start thinking this way.</p>
<p>Has man become any better since the times of Theogenes? The world is
replete with badness. I’m not talking about that old routine where you
drag out the Spanish Inquisition, the Holocaust, Joseph Stalin, the
Khmer Rouge, etc. It happens in our own back yard. Twentieth-century
America is one of the most materially prosperous nations in history. But
take a walk through an American prison, a nursing home, the slums where
the homeless live in cardboard boxes, a cancer ward. Go to a Vietnam
vets’ meeting, or an A.A. meeting, or an Overeaters Anonymous meeting.
How hollow and unreal a thing is life, how deceitful are its pleasures,
what horrible aspects it possesses. Is the world not rather like a hell,
as Schopenhauer, that clearheaded seer—who has helped me transform my
suffering into an object of understanding—was so quick to point out?
They called him a pessimist and dismissed him with a word, but it is
peace and self-renewal that I have found in his pages.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>About a year after my fight with the guy from artillery I started
having seizures. I suffered from a form of left-temporal-lobe seizure
which is sometimes called Dostoyevski’s epilepsy. It’s so rare as to be
almost unknown. Freud, himself a neurologist, speculated that
Dostoyevski was a hysterical epileptic, and that his fits were unrelated
to brain damage—psychogenic in origin. Dostoyevski did not have his
first attack until the age of twenty-five, when he was imprisoned in
Siberia and received fifty lashes after complaining about the food.
Freud figured that after Dostoyevski’s mock execution, the four years’
imprisonment in Siberia, the tormented childhood, the murder of his
tyrannical father, etc. andandandand etc.—he had all the earmarks of
hysteria, of grave psychological trauma. And Dostoyevski had displayed
the trademark features of the psychomotor epileptic long before his
first attack. These days physicians insist there is no such thing as the
“epileptic personality.” I think they say this because they do not want
to add to the burden of the epileptic’s suffering with an extra stigma.
Privately they do believe in these traits. Dostoyevski was nervous and
depressed, a tormented hypochondriac, a compulsive writer obsessed with
religious and philosophic themes. He was hyperloquacious, raving, etc.
andandandand etc. His gambling addiction is well known. By most accounts
he was a sick soul.</p>
<p>The peculiar and most distinctive thing about his epilepsy was that
in the split second before his fit—in the aura, which is in fact
officially a part of the attack—Dostoyevski experienced a sense of
felicity, of ecstatic well-being unlike anything an ordinary mortal
could hope to imagine. It was the experience of satori. Not the
nickel-and-dime satori of Abraham Maslow, but the Supreme. He said that
he wouldn’t trade ten years of life for this feeling, and I, who have
had it, too, would have to agree. I can’t explain it, I don’t understand
it—it becomes slippery and elusive when it gets any distance on you—but
I have felt this down to the core of my being. Yes, God exists! But then
it slides away and I lose it. I become a doubter. Even Dostoyevski, the
fervent Christian, makes an almost airtight case against the possibility
of the existence of God in the Grand Inquisitor digression in “The
Brothers Karamazov.” It is probably the greatest passage in all of world
literature, and it tilts you to the court of the atheist. This is what
happens when you approach Him with the intellect.</p>
<p>It is thought that St. Paul had a temporal-lobe fit on the road to
Damascus. Paul warns us in First Corinthians that God will confound the
intellectuals. It is known that Muhammad composed the Koran after
attacks of epilepsy. Black Elk experienced fits before his grand
“buffalo” vision. Joan of Arc is thought to have been a
left-temporal-lobe epileptic. Each of these in a terrible flash of brain
lightning was able to pierce the murky veil of illusion which is spread
over all things. Just so did the scales fall from my eyes. It is called
the “sacred disease.”</p>
<p>But what a price. I rarely leave the house anymore. To avoid falling
injuries, I always wear my old boxer’s headgear, and I always carry my
mouthpiece. Rather more often than the aura where “every common bush is
afire with God,” I have the typical epileptic aura, which is that of
terror and impending doom. If I can keep my head and think of it, and if
there is time, I slip the mouthpiece in and thus avoid biting my tongue.
I bit it in half once, and when they sewed it back together it swelled
enormously, like a huge red-and-black sausage. I was unable to close my
mouth for more than two weeks.</p>
<p>The fits are coming more and more. I’m loaded on Depakene,
phenobarbital, Tegretol, Dilantin—the whole shitload. A nurse from the
V.A. bought a pair of Staffordshire terriers for me and trained them to
watch me as I sleep, in case I have a fit and smother face down in my
bedding. What delightful companions these dogs are! One of them, Gloria,
is especially intrepid and clever. Inevitably, when I come to I find
that the dogs have dragged me into the kitchen, away from blankets and
pillows, rugs, and objects that might suffocate me, and that they have
turned me on my back. There’s Gloria, barking in my face. Isn’t this
incredible?</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>My sister brought a neurosurgeon over to my place around
Christmas—not some V.A. butcher but a guy from the university hospital.
He was a slick dude in a nine-hundred-dollar suit. He came down on me
hard, like a used-car salesman. He wants to cauterize a small spot in a
nerve bundle in my brain. “It’s not a lobotomy, it’s a cingulotomy,” he
said.</p>
<p>Reckless, desperate, last-ditch psychosurgery is still pretty much
unthinkable in the conservative medical establishment. That’s why he
made a personal visit to my place. A house call. Drumming up some action
to make himself a name. “See that bottle of Thorazine?” he said. “You
can throw that poison away,” he said. “All that amitriptyline. That’s
garbage, you can toss that, too.” He said, “Tell me something. How can
you take all of that shit and still walk?” He said, “You take enough
drugs to drop an elephant.”</p>
<p>He wants to cut me. He said that the feelings of guilt and
worthlessness, and the heaviness of a heart blackened by sin, will go
away. “It is not a lobotomy,” he said.</p>
<p>I don’t like the guy. I don’t trust him. I’m not convinced, but I
can’t go on like this. If I am not having a panic attack I am engulfed
in tedious, unrelenting depression. I am overcome with a deadening sense
of languor; I can’t do anything. I wanted to give my buddies a good
show! What a goddam fool. I am a goddam fool!</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>It has taken me six months to put my thoughts in order, but I wanted
to do it in case I am a vegetable after the operation. I know that my
buddy Jorgeson was a real American hero. I wish that he had lived to be
something else, if not a painter of pictures then even some kind of
fuckup with a factory job and four divorces, bankruptcy petitions, in
and out of jail. I wish he had been that. I wish he had been anything
rather than a real American hero. So, then, if I am to feel somewhat
indifferent to life after the operation, all the better. If not,
not.</p>
<p>If I had a more conventional sense of morality I would shitcan those
dress blues, and I’d send that Navy Cross to Jorgeson’s brother.
Jorgeson was the one who won it, who pulled the John Wayne number up
there near Khe Sanh and saved my life, although I lied and took the
credit for all of those dead N.V.A. He had created a stunning body
count—nothing like Theogenes, but Jorgesen only had something like
twelve minutes total in the theatre of war.</p>
<p>The high command almost awarded me the Medal of Honor, but of course
there were no witnesses to what I claimed I had done, and I had saved no
one’s life. When I think back on it, my tale probably did not sound as
credible as I thought it had at the time. I was only nineteen years old
and not all that practiced a liar. I figure if they had given me the
Medal of Honor, I would have stood in the ring up at Camp Las Pulgas in
Pendleton and let that light heavyweight from artillery fucking kill
me.</p>
<p>Now I’m thinking I might call Hey Baby and ask how he’s doing. No
shit, a couple of neuro/psyches—we probably have a lot in common. I
could apologize to him. But I learned from my fits that you don’t have
to do that. Good and evil are only illusions. Still, I cannot help but
wonder sometimes if my vision of the Supreme Reality was any more real
than the demons visited upon schizophrenics and madmen. Has it all been
just a stupid neurochemical event? Is there no God at all? The human
heart rebels against this.</p>
<p>If they fuck up the operation, I hope I get to keep my dogs
somehow—maybe stay at my sister’s place. If they send me to the nuthouse
I lose the dogs for sure.</p>
