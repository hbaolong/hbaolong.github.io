<h4 id="the-first-american">The First American</h4>
<p>By Lore Segal (1983)</p>
<p>Ilka Weissnix had been three months in this country when she went
West and discovered her first American sitting on a stool in a bar in
the desert, across from the railroad. He bought her a whiskey and asked
her what in the name of the blessed Jehoshaphat she was doing in
Cowtown, Nevada.</p>
<p>“Nevada!” Ilka said. “I have believed I am being in Utah, isn’t
it?”</p>
<p>“Utah!” The face of the big American turned a sick, gray color.
“Where the hell am I?” he asked the barman.</p>
<p>“Hagen,” replied the barman, swiping a dish towel at a glass beer
mug, “ass end of Noplace, Nevada.”</p>
<p>“Aha! So!” Ilka sipped her whiskey and, hiding her smile inside her
glass, said, “I do not believe.”</p>
<p>“What don’t you believe?” asked the American.</p>
<p>“That I sit in Utah.”</p>
<p>“Nevada,” the man said.</p>
<p>“I do not believe Nevada, Utah, America.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Ilka was twenty-one. It had taken her more than a decade to get from
Vienna to New York. She had left in 1938, when Hitler came. The Austrian
Weissnixes had known so little of their relations, the Litvak
Fishgoppels, Ilka had been unaware that she had an American cousin until
some time after the end of the war, when the cousin traced Ilka’s
whereabouts and sent her a visa and an air ticket.</p>
<p>Fishgoppel had come into New York to meet the new refugee at
Idlewild. “Ich muss nemen ein examen. Ich muss gein back to school,”
shouted Fishgoppel across the roar and shriek of the subway that was
carrying them uptown. “Ihr will stay in mein apartment in New York,
O.K.?”</p>
<p>“Excuse, please?” Ilka had shouted back.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry! My horrible Yiddish!” yelled Fishgoppel and hit herself
in the head.</p>
<p>“Yiddish!” shouted Ilka, lighting on the only word she understood.
“By us in Vienna has nobody speaken Yiddish outside the Polischen!”</p>
<p>“What?” hollered Fishgoppel, and they laughed and turned out both
palms of their hands, understanding each other to mean, “Too noisy. One
can’t even talk!”</p>
<p>Fishgoppel’s small upper-West Side apartment had the simple layout of
a dumbbell. The front door opened into the middle of a narrow foyer with
a room at each end.</p>
<p>“One for you,” said Fishgoppel, “and one for your mother, when we get
her to America.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know where my mother is. I don’t know if she lives,” said
Ilka. She looked around at Fishgoppel’s possessions; each object was out
of harmony with every other in a way for which the laws of probability
did not account. Ilka looked at Fishgoppel: only a persevering spirit
could have parlayed that pure skin and wonderful black hair and those
sweet, clever eyes into such dowdiness.</p>
<p>“Look at the time!” cried Fishgoppel. “Here is a dictionary. Here is
the map of the subway. This is where you get off for the employment
agency. Here’s where they give English classes…. Are you going to
manage?”</p>
<p>“Thanks!” said Ilka.</p>
<p>“The butcher on the corner of Broadway speaks German. The shul is two
blocks that way.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Here is my number. Call me. I’ll call you. I’ll come in for the day
as soon as my exams are over. Will you be all right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Thanks,” said Ilka.</p>
<p>“Don’t!” cried Fishgoppel. “Don’t thank me!”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Minutes after Fishgoppel had run to catch the train back to New
Haven, Ilka took the elevator down and burst into the streets of New
York, which looked like the streets of Ilka’s childhood Vienna—the same
flat, staid, gray façades except that here, right in front of her,
walked a real American couple, having an American conversation. Ilka ran
to catch up, and walked close behind them. She understood the old man
saying, “Because I wear proper shoes in which a person can walk.” The
old woman said, “Because you don’t have bunions.” The man said, “Because
I wear proper shoes,” and Ilka recognized that it was German they were
speaking, with the round Viennese vowels cushioned between relaxed
Viennese consonants.</p>
<p>When Ilka got back to the apartment the telephone was ringing for
Fishgoppel: Would Fishgoppel collect on the sixth floor for the United
Negro College Fund?</p>
<p>“I will collect. I am the cousin from Fishgoppel,” said Ilka, who
wanted to get a look into—to get inside—American homes.</p>
<p>The nameplate outside Apartment 6-A said “Wolfgang Placzek.” He
handed her fifty cents through the cracked door. While 6-B went to look
for change, Ilka put her head inside the foyer and saw the little green
marble boy extracting the same splinter from his foot, on the same tree
stump, on the same round lace doily on which he had sat in Ilka’s
mother’s foyer in Vienna. The woman came back. “Nix! Nothing,” she said.
It did her grief but her man was not to house. 6-C was Fishgoppel, and
6-D would not open; the voice through the peephole came from Berlin. It
did her grief also but her sister had a stroke and was to bed.</p>
<p>“How?” Ilka asked the woman at the employment agency when she told
Ilka to go away and practice her English. “With whom shall I praxis,
when you are the only American I met in New York? The onlies others that
I met in my English class are yet other outlanders, which know always
only yet other outlanders, which know yet lesser English as I!”</p>
<p>The woman on the other side of the desk drew her head back from the
assault of Ilka’s complaining. She was a fat woman with a lot of
corseted and useless bosom. She looked as if there was some complaining
she might do, give her half a chance. “New York,” she finally said to
Ilka, “is not America, like all you people always think.”</p>
<p>The next time Fishgoppel came in to see how Ilka was managing, Ilka
complained to her that New York was not America.</p>
<p>Fishgoppel frowned, did some mental arithmetic, and offered Ilka the
week’s trip West.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Fishgoppel returned to New Haven and Ilka went West. She practiced
her English with the train conductor. He leaned over the back of the
seat in front of Ilka and asked her to guess how long he had been on
this Denver–Los Angeles run.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Ilka smiled the self-conscious smile she knew from her
mirror, and regretted. It exposed her two long front teeth with the
little gap between and made her look, she believed, like a friendly
village simpleton. She was a thin girl. In certain lights her hair
matched the color of her eyes, which Ilka thought of as khaki. She
smiled apologetically and sweetly at the round, red-faced conductor; he
looked like a healthy old baby. He held up three left and two right
fingers. “Thirty-two years!”</p>
<p>“Aha!” said Ilka.</p>
<p>“Know it like”—he pointed to the inside of his pocket, “like the”—and
he held up the palm of his hand and pointed at it. “I’ll be back,” he
promised.</p>
<p>Ilka looked out at land as level as the primordial water before the
creation of breath disturbed its surface, uninterrupted by any object,
man-made or natural, as far as the ruler-straight horizon, except
outside the window on her left, where a grid of apartment buildings
formed a small, square city whose near perimeter coincided with the
railroad platform. The train stopped when it had aligned Ilka with Main
Street, at the far end of which stood a mountain, like a giant purple
ice-cream cone turned upside down on the perfectly flat world. Ilka
wanted somebody to laugh with, to turn to and say, “I don’t believe
this!” She might have imagined that she had imagined this Atlantis onto
the desert floor but for the details, which were not in her experience
to engender: bars, bowling alleys, barbershops, numberless eating places
with neon signs that ran and jumped and stopped, and switched from
pastel greens to pale yellows to pinks leached out by the tail end of
daylight.</p>
<p>Ilka’s conductor returned. He multiplied his ten fingers by thrusting
them into Ilka’s face nine separate times: “A ninety-minute stopover.”
He handed her down the steps.</p>
<p>And that was how Ilka Weissnix from Vienna came to stand in the
middle of the New World. Ilka thought she was in Utah, and she thought
Utah was dead in the heart of America.</p>
<p>Ilka was very excited. She ran up the platform until it stopped
across from the long, low building which formed the northwest corner of
the square little town. The building was made of a rosy, luminescent
brick and quivered in the blue haze of the oncoming night—it levitated.
Its classic windows and square white letters saying “American Glue Inc”
moved Ilka with a sense of beauty so out of proportion with its object
she recognized euphoria. It knocked out her common sense of time. Afraid
of being left behind, but more afraid that she might miss what more
there might be to be seen, Ilka turned and ran close alongside the train
until the platform stopped across from the shack which held the
northeast end of town down upon the desert the way one of those little
gummed corners fixes your snapshot in place on the page of a photograph
album. The shack had a roof like a cocked hat slipped down over one eye.
A neon sign said “Larr ’s B r nd Eats.”</p>
<p>With the reluctance of someone who sticks a foot into an alien
element, Ilka stepped off the platform onto the dirt road, crossed to
the other side, and with a palpitating heart depressed the handle of the
door.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The thin man behind the bar went on wiping a glass with an agitated
white dishcloth, but the elderly American swivelled on his barstool to
see who had come in. He was a very large, very stout man with grizzled
hair, cut peculiarly short, and flattened against the big skull in a way
the girl did not understand. His skin had a yellow hue. The nose was
flat, the mouth wide—like a frog’s, Ilka would have thought, if it had
not been for a look about him of weight, of weightiness. Like a Roman
senator, thought Ilka.</p>
<p>Feeling herself looked at, Ilka had ducked into the booth nearest the
door. By the time she raised her self-conscious smile, the big American
had returned to his conversation with the barman. There were women who
got looked at longer—Ilka knew that. Anyway, he was an older man, and
what Ilka had come West for was American conversation.</p>
<p>Ilka listened and thought the barman said, “Coming down cats and dogs
but I mean something fierce,” and, thinking she hadn’t been listening
properly, she listened harder.</p>
<p>The barman said, “This kid I knew in high school’s dad is in a cab
coming down Lex I think it was.”</p>
<p>The man on the barstool said, “This is in New York?,” which Ilka
understood. She felt encouraged and leaned closer and listened.</p>
<p>The barman said, “Where else is there? Guess the brakes quit on the
guy. This kid’s dad. He lost his thumb, busted both legs, left side of
his face is all chewed up, and this pip of a shyster out of nowhere is
running alongside the stretcher, says he can get him a lump sum in
compensation, which is what I’m telling you is what you have to have,
once in your lifetime, give you an opportunity.”</p>
<p>Ilka was trying to connect “shyster” (the English cognate,
presumably, of the German “scheissen”) and “lump” (as in a mattress)
plus “sum” (the mathematical result of totting up), and she had missed
everything the barman said after that. She forgot to listen and studied
the red plastic booth she sat in. Ilka thought that the back seats of
two automobiles had been taken out and placed face to face; three booths
times two back seats in each made—six red automobiles!</p>
<p>The barman said, “Got the wife to sue for deprivation of sexual
excess or whatever—”</p>
<p>“Access?” suggested the older man on the stool.</p>
<p>“You name it, he sued for it.” The barman was coming around the bar
and walking toward Ilka saying,
“Physicaltormentalanguishdiminishedreproductivity…What’ll it be?” he
asked Ilka.</p>
<p>“Excuse, please?” said Ilka and smiled at him with her apologetic
teeth and shook her head. “I cannot yet so well English.”</p>
<p>The barman, who seemed worn to bone and nerve by a chronic high of
exasperation, picked a shred of plastic off the flaking red seat while
his foot kicked the center leg to see if the table held. He raised his
chin like a dog about to howl and said, “You want a drink?”</p>
<p>“Please, coffee,” said Ilka.</p>
<p>“Coffee!” howled the barman in a voice outside the human range of
sound. He walked back around the bar and disappeared through a door into
a region beyond Ilka’s sight and outside the range of her imagination.
She pictured a blackness, out of which the barman’s voice went on with
what he had been telling the man on the barstool: “This kid’s dad comes
out the hospital, has lost his hearing in one ear—or wishes he lost it,
is what he used to tell us kids, so he wouldn’t hear this noise all the
time like someone pissing inside his ear, loud, like Niagara.”</p>
<p>“Jesus!” the man on the stool said. “That could drive a man to
drink.”</p>
<p>“Only thing could drown it out was trumpets turned with the volume
all the way up. See,” said the barman, “this is hi-fi coming in. This
guy, he buys every damn book, reads up in the magazines, and goes into
audio with his lump sum in compensation, and makes a mint. Owns his own
home in Bayshead! But you don’t get a lump sum,” said the barman, coming
out with Ilka’s cup of coffee, “you don’t got a opportunity, I don’t
care what anybody is going to tell you.”</p>
<p>“And that’s true, too,” said the stout older man. He raised his voice
to the tenor pitch that best carried it into the booth by the door,
where the young blonde sat and watched him. “The problem, as I see it,
is how you’re going to put your idea over.”</p>
<p>“My idea?” said the barman.</p>
<p>“You want me to introduce it in the United Nations for you?”</p>
<p>Ilka was surprised at the high, hilarious note coming from the
weighty-looking older man.</p>
<p>“Or were you thinking in terms of an amendment to the Bill of
Rights?”</p>
<p>“Was I thinking…”</p>
<p>“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men have the
unalienable right to a lump sum?”</p>
<p>“Once in your lifetime,” said the barman, “is all I’m saying to
you.”</p>
<p>“See if I understand you, now, is this for white only, or Negro as
well?”</p>
<p>“Listen! I ain’t prejudiced like your local cowboys. I’m from New
York!” said the barman. “Ain’t I standing here talking to you like a
person? You want, I’ll make you a sandwich?”</p>
<p>“Jesus God!” the man on the stool said gaily. “Imagine every one of
us black sons of a gun going to have an equal opportunity to get our
thumbs, legs, and eardrums busted, same as any white man in the land!
Let me check this out with you: Everybody has to first get pretty much
chewed up is what you’re saying?”</p>
<p>“That’s what it’s compensation for! The way I figure it you don’t get
something for nothing, but how it is now you get nothing period.”</p>
<p>“It’s an idea,” said the man on the stool, “that will revolutionize
the economy!”</p>
<p>“It is? It will?” The barman looked nervous.</p>
<p>“Sure!” the man on the stool said. He crossed one ankle over the
other, effecting a quarter turn in Ilka’s direction. “Say you take the
Social Security money for the year X and, instead of pissing it away on
the poor, the old, and the sick, you divvy it up—let’s say three
thousand bucks apiece, to every baby born that same year, black and
white—and—stick with me here—the government invests each baby’s three
thousand at, say, five per cent, till the babies get to be twenty-nine.
Or would you say thirty-five?”</p>
<p>“Thirty-five has more horse sense,” said the barman.</p>
<p>“O.K. Now,” said the man on the stool, “when the babies are
thirty-five they cut off their thumbs, break their legs, pierce their
eardrums, and give each and every one of them the lump sum of…” He
patted his breast pocket, took out an envelope, and said, “You got a
pencil there? Thank you. Three thousand at five per cent times
thirty-five compounded”—the man on the stool did arithmetic for a
while—“dollars fifteen thousand seven hundred and sixty!” he said
triumphantly.</p>
<p>The barman looked agitated. “And the poor, old, sick folks?”</p>
<p>“What poor, old, sick folks!” cried the man on the stool. “They got
their lumps when they were thirty-five and made a mint! They own their
own homes—Negroes, whites, everybody! In Bayshead!”</p>
<p>“I guess,” said the barman.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Ilka had stopped listening. She studied the expanse of the older
man’s tweed back. It was an autumnal mixture of heather flecked with
rust, mauve, green…. Ilka had observed that same easy angle of the wrist
of the hand which held the cigarette in other men, and women, too. She
thought it connoted the carnal know-how she despaired of for herself.
Ilka could see the man’s tongue laughing inside his enormous mouth. She
had never seen a grown person laugh so loudly for such a long time, with
the mouth so wide open. Now he raised his eloquent right hand; he
beckoned. Ilka turned to see who might have come in the door behind her,
but there was no one to claim the gesture and she turned back with a
conscious smile, trusting it to double for an acknowledgment, in case he
meant her, and a general complaisance if he hadn’t.</p>
<p>“You ever get yours?” the man asked the barman.</p>
<p>“Worse luck,” said the barman. “I was in construction, damn near
killed in a cave-in. Man, what a mess! See now, here’s what I’m telling
you. When they used to give me my thirty bucks Saturday night, by Monday
morning—like you said—I pissed it away, what else is there? But you put
five thousand smackeroos into my hand, I’m a capitalist! I’m going to
hang on to every lousy buck! I’m going to make something out of
myself.”</p>
<p>“What did you do?”</p>
<p>“I read where they were building this four-lane highway, and I come
out here, I see the surveyors with my own eyes! Outside this window! I
figure I buy this place cheap—the big money wants to be on Main—and do
it up nice, like New York. You can’t tell anymore now, but ten years ago
this place was, I mean sharp! I figure every one of the fellers be
coming in here for his breakfast, lunch, a home away from home, and
booze it up nights for the three or whatever years it’s going to take
them to build me a highway up to my front door, I sell out at a price,
go back, and open a classy place on Third Avenue—how can I lose?”</p>
<p>“What happened?” the man on the stool asked.</p>
<p>“They built the highway four miles the other side of town is what
happened.”</p>
<p>“You going to sell out, then?”</p>
<p>“To who? You going to be fool enough to take my monkey and put it on
your back? Are you? No, you are not!”</p>
<p>“You got the custom from the railroad,” the man said.</p>
<p>“Oh, right!” the barman said. “There’s the 10:45 a.m. Denver–L.A. and
the 12:15 L.A.–Denver, and the 5:40 you got off of, and the 8 p.m. the
lady came on”—he indicated Ilka, listening in her booth—“maybe a couple
rednecks drop in for a beer and put two nickels in the juke. You want
another bourbon?”</p>
<p>“Maybe the lady will join me?”</p>
<p>He did mean me, thought Ilka, gratified. It was me he beckoned.</p>
<p>“Will you have a drink?”</p>
<p>“Thanks, no,” said Ilka. “I must soon back in the train. Thanks!”</p>
<p>But the man had risen and was standing, with a nice formality, next
to his stool. It took Ilka time to extricate her feet from under the
table and walk across the floor. The man waited until she had seated
herself before resuming his own stool. He offered her a cigarette.
“Thanks, no.” Ilka did not smoke. What would she like to drink? Ilka did
not drink.</p>
<p>“No, thanks. Likör makes me—how do you say it in English ‘sich
übergeben’? To overgive the self…You can maybe German?”</p>
<p>“A little Swahili?” the man offered.</p>
<p>“Excuse, please?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know German. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Ilka did a charade, and he said, “Liquor makes you throw up! No it
doesn’t.” To the barman he said, “The lady will have a Black
andandandand White diluted with a little water, start her off nice and
easy. I’ll teach you how to drink,” he told Ilka.</p>
<p>“You are living here?” Ilka asked him.</p>
<p>“Christ, no!” the man said. He told Ilka that he was en route from
California to New York for a brand-new start and had stopped off to have
himself one, last big bender.</p>
<p>“Speak, please, slower,” said Ilka.</p>
<p>“I’m going to tie one on,” explained the man, and it was here he had
asked Ilka what in the name of the blessed Jehoshaphat she was doing in
Cowtown, Nevada, which Ilka had mistaken, and was, for the years to
come, to persist in mistaking, for Utah.</p>
<p>Ilka said, “I search for Americans. Except the woman from the
employment office, you are my first real.”</p>
<p>“Real…?” The man leaned his ear toward her.</p>
<p>“A real American,” said Ilka.</p>
<p>“Of the second class,” said the big man.</p>
<p>Ilka shook her head and said, “I think every moment I am
understanding lesser and lesser.”</p>
<p>It was here that Carter Bayoux introduced himself. He said, “I’m a
wonderful teacher.”</p>
<p>“My name is Ilonka Weissnix,” said Ilka. “And I want to learn”—she
made a large, inclusive gesture—“this all.”</p>
<p>They shook hands. He said, “Let me buy you a sandwich. What do you
like?”</p>
<p>Ilka smiled inside her glass and said, “I cannot the names of the
American sandwich.”</p>
<p>“You make Reubens?” the man asked the barman.</p>
<p>“Do fish swim?” is what Ilka thought the barman replied before he
disappeared back into his private darkness.</p>
<p>“You don’t look like a teacher,” said Ilka and blushed: she thought
she was flirting.</p>
<p>The man regarded Ilka with his bright brown stare and asked, “Like
what do I look?”</p>
<p>“That,” said Ilka, “is what I am not understanding. When I walk on
Broadway and see an old Viennese pair I can understand already from
behind what the man has worked in Vienna, how it looked in their room…”
Ilka stopped, appalled at the number and complication of the English
sentences ahead.</p>
<p>“Go on,” the man said.</p>
<p>She shook her head. Ilka meant that she recognized the proportions,
height by width, of the old man’s Jewish back, which fit and failed to
fit, in the same places, into the same suit Ilka’s father wore to the
shop. The fabric that upholstered the fat old wife was the navy cotton,
patterned with the same full-blown roses, bows, garlands, and violins,
of Great-Aunt Mali’s Sunday dresses. Those German pre-war cottons wore
like iron and had outlasted Great-Aunt Mali, as well as Ilka’s father
and three aunts, five uncles, and two of the cousins who used to gather
for Aunt Mali’s afternoons of Kaffee und Gugelhupf. Aunt Mali’s oversize
table had stood square in the middle of the room; the tile stove in the
left corner gave off too much heat. The walls were dark and striped, the
curtains lace, and the drapes flowered and fringed with black wooden
beads, which little Ilka, lying on the Turkey carpet—cozy, too hot,
bored, more than half asleep—had pulled off one after the other. Aunt
Mali had sat drinking coffee, and watched Ilka.</p>
<p>Ilka shook her head and said, “It is too complicate to tell it. But I
look at you and…”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Ilka shook her head. She meant that she did not understand his hair;
that the size of his mouth and his laughter did not go with the urbane
bend of his wrist and the way he crossed his ankles; that the luxurious
tweed of his jacket contradicted his wide nose and mouth.</p>
<p>Ilka said, “Take for an example these two Americans which are coming
in by the door.” She swivelled on her stool and watched the newcomers
settle into the booth she had recently vacated. They called for Larry.
“Couple beers, Larry!” One was a little shorter, with a big chest, the
other a few years younger perhaps. Both were in their thirties, of
middling height, and wore, it seemed to Ilka, their undershirts. They
had ruddy arms and blunt, round heads and they looked underdone, as if
they had been taken out prematurely and put down in the world.</p>
<p>Ilka said, “I look, and I am seeing two men, but I cannot imagine
what they are making for a living, or how dress their wives, or how it
looks in their rooms…”</p>
<p>The one who was perhaps younger shouted, “Larry? What’s with Larry?”
and stuck his head out of the booth; he looked around the room, and the
American on the stool said, “Keep talking,” in a different, high voice
Ilka had not heard before. She turned to see what had happened. Nothing
had happened. There was nothing different in the way he sat, with his
ankles crossed, his right hand around the glass on the bar; he had not
moved so much as his eyes to take in the newcomers, but sat very still;
only his left arm, pivoting at the shoulder, brought the cigarette to
his mouth and took it away again. In his new voice, pitched in the high,
thin register of the castrato, he said, “I’ll buy you dinner on Main
Street.”</p>
<p>“Oh! But,” said Ilka, “Larry makes already our sandwich, isn’t
it?”</p>
<p>And here came Larry with two foaming mugs, which he carried around
the bar and across the floor. He set them on the table between the two
men and slid into the booth, next to the one with the big chest. (This
aborted and unexplained sandwich Ilka laid away in the patient back part
of the mind where a child keeps things it doesn’t know what to make of,
and other things it doesn’t know it doesn’t understand; there they lie
forgotten, but available to join with future information that will
elucidate some but not all.)</p>
<p>The man on the stool smoked his cigarette down to a nubbin, then took
his wallet from his breast pocket. He said, “We leave separately.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Go out the door, turn left, walk to Main Street, and wait for
me.”</p>
<p>“I can wait in here,” said Ilka.</p>
<p>The man did not say anything. Ilka looked at him. Was it that his
neck had thickened—or shortened? Or withdrawn into his shoulders? Had
the ears retracted? The head and shoulders had streamlined; some outside
pressure, failing to eliminate his person, had compacted it, and reduced
its size without affecting its bulk. He looked like a high-calibre
torpedo. Ilka saw what she saw and stored it away in her mind. She said,
“Yes, so then, I will wait at the corner.”</p>
<p>He did not raise his head; he was busy with his wallet. Ilka
collected her things and rose.</p>
<p>“We are not all white” was what she thought one of the men in the
booth had said. She stopped and looked in and the man with the chest was
looking her straight in the eye. It was to her he was talking.</p>
<p>Ilka said, “Excuse me?” The other, younger man, too, was looking at
her. Ilka said, “I am new in America, and cannot so well understand.”
She smiled her sweet, apologetic smile, and leaned closer to listen
harder, and the man, looking her in the eye and enunciating very
clearly, said it again: “We are not all white.”</p>
<p>Ilka smiled. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Either one of you fellows once in your lifetime got a lump sum? Did
you ever have a opportunity?” the barman was asking the two men as Ilka
walked out of the door.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>This end of town was deserted and dark, the way the blacked-out
wartime cities of Europe had been dark, except for that same curious
pink glow Ilka had observed in the night sky over Manhattan. She
imagined that it emanated from the noisy neon lights of every Times
Square or Main Street, floated upward and spread like a comforter of
rosy and possibly noxious haze over America.</p>
<p>Ilka walked to Main Street and waited. Presently the big American
from the bar stood at the curb beside her. He kept a slice of the night
air between them. The purple mountain had been assumed into the
blackness, which had pepped up the colored lights. Over the restaurant
across the street a blue cow blinked glamorous Disney lashes once,
twice, and went out. “The Blue Cow” spelled itself in yellow capitals.
Ilka felt excited and hilarious. On both thronging sidewalks everyone
was male and young.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe! I think this I have imagined!” Ilka laughed. She
turned to the American.</p>
<p>He was looking at her; he looked deliberately across the street, and
back at Ilka, and said, “We’re standing here, side by side, but how do I
know what you see?”</p>
<p>“This,” Ilka said with a sensation of bliss, “is what I am meaning.”
She was afterward to identify it as the moment in which she fell in
love; it coincided with a break in the traffic and his first, slight
touch under her elbow—an anachronistic courtesy that assumes the woman
cannot step down into the street or make it safely to the other side
without the man’s supporting hand. He withdrew it as soon as he had
helped her up the curb.</p>
<p>“Where would you like to eat?”</p>
<p>“I would like that you are choosing.”</p>
<p>“Right,” he said. He walked her past “The Blue Cow” and past the “Bar
and Beef.” “Are you afraid?” he asked her.</p>
<p>“No,” said Ilka, “because I am with you.”</p>
<p>“With me. Ah,” the big American said, walking past the “Steak and
Swill” and past “Harry’s Hash,” but at “The Versailles”—no better, it
seemed to Ilka, and no worse than the others—he opened and held the
door.</p>
<p>“Here by the window is good for looking,” said the insatiable Ilka,
but the man walked her past the window table, walked past a second and a
third empty table, and made a U-turn around a table from which three men
had raised their eyes. The three men watched a large middle-aged
yellow-skinned Negro march out the door, followed by a thin young
blonde.</p>
<p>Back in the street, he asked Ilka if she was hungry.</p>
<p>“Not so hungry,” said Ilka.</p>
<p>They walked past Harry’s Hash, and he turned and looked behind him.
Ilka turned also. She said, “I don’t understand what for men are all
these…”</p>
<p>“Men!” said the man. They passed the Steak and Swill. “Good enough
fellows, as fellows go—care for their kids, satisfy their wives some of
the time, do their work well as can be expected, and pay their taxes,
mostly, go to church, or not, and will string me up as soon as look at
me.”</p>
<p>“String you?” Ilka did not understand him. She said, “I think soon I
must again instep in the train, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I’ll wait with you,” said the man. They walked past the Bar and
Beef, past the Blue Cow. He held her elbow across the dirt road and
assisted her up onto the platform.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you afraid of me?” the big American asked Ilka as they walked
alongside the empty, darkened train.</p>
<p>Ilka thought about this, and said, “N0.”</p>
<p>They sat down on a bench underneath one of the half-dozen lamps, weak
and unsteady as gaslight, that made no inroads upon the darkness.</p>
<p>“I would have liked to make love to you,” said the American
gloomily.</p>
<p>Ilka, who was not in the habit of receiving propositions, understood
this one as a courtesy, intended as a compliment. The man said, “When a
man hasn’t so much as managed to buy a woman dinner, it’s not
conducive.”</p>
<p>“I’m not so hungry,” said Ilka.</p>
<p>“Well well well well well,” the American said. “I owe you.”</p>
<p>They exchanged addresses. He wrote Fishgoppel’s telephone number into
a well-worn leather-bound address book. On the corner of an envelope he
wrote the name of the hotel in New York where, he said, he used to live
and might take a room, if they had one, until he figured out what the
hell he was doing.</p>
<p>“There is my conductor,” said Ilka.</p>
<p>“When do you get back to town?”</p>
<p>“Sunday,” said Ilka. “Monday I must go again to—I call it the agency
of unemployment.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, indeed,” the man said. He handed her up the steps, into the
train.</p>
<p>When Ilka turned to say goodbye she saw the droop of his face, and
the sad expanse of his cheek grew large, larger, blurred; it filled
Ilka’s eyes, and Ilka’s lips touched and depressed the male softness of
his flesh, while her mind went scampering after something funny, in
English, with which to unsay what she was doing here. Ilka laughed and
said, “This also I do not believe! You, I know, I imagined!” and
withdrew her head to the distance at which the features of his face
resumed their surface and outline with a difference: his wide-open,
unblinking eyes looked without a hint of irony, and shameless with
emotion, full into Ilka’s face.</p>
<p>Ilka ducked up the stairs, found her seat, and let the window down.
When had the platform filled with so many people saying their goodbyes
and getting onto the train? It took her a moment to identify the back of
the American from the barstool, already walking away.</p>
