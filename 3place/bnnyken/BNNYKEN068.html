<h4 id="the-christmas-miracle">The Christmas Miracle</h4>
<p>By Rebecca Curtis (2013)</p>
<p>Cats were dying. This happens, of course. But in this case they were
dying in a gory way, one after another, and my nieces, who were six and
seven years old, were witnessing the deaths, and it was Christmas, the
most magical, horrible, spiritual, dark, and stressful time of the year,
so we—my older sister and her husband, my younger twin brothers, my
sister’s in-laws, our mother and our uncle, and the other relatives who
were gathered at my sister’s house in Revelstoke for the holiday—were
trying to prevent more cat deaths. My sister had had five cats. She’d
adopted them from the pound, because they were going to be killed. She
wanted every living being to be happy. I am telling this story to you,
K, even though you are a Russian Communist and a Jewish person who
doesn’t believe Jesus was the son of God, and even though Christmas is
an obnoxious holiday when millions of people decapitate pine trees and
watch them slowly die in their living rooms, because miracles can happen
on any day, and as long as man has existed he’s celebrated this weirdest
time of year, the shortest stretch of sunlight, the winter solstice, as
a time of fear, change, courage, and passion. I’m going to tell you the
story of a miracle that happened at Christmas.</p>
<p>I was not at a great point in my life leading up to the miracle. I
was teaching creative-writing classes, but I hadn’t managed to think
clearly enough to write and publish anything in years. I had Lyme
disease and some co-infections that I was treating with intravenous
antibiotics: babesiosis, a malaria-like virus that drains red blood
cells and causes fatigue; and bartonellosis, a bacterial infection
common among homeless men, which causes vascular inflammation in the
brain and bouts of madness, fantastical visions, and frank or rude
speech, usually set off by eating carbohydrates. I’d completed my degree
in nutrition, and had luck helping clients overcome ailments, especially
infertile women who wanted to conceive, so I knew which foods I should
eat and which I shouldn’t. But if cake was nearby I wasn’t always able
to prevent myself from having one bite; then the sugar fed the
Bartonella bacteria, which commanded me to eat more, and I would, and
then I’d go insane.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I’d asked my sister to cancel the traditions of:
1) baking, frosting, and decorating forty dozen sugar cookies; 2)
constructing a ginger-bread mansion; 3) baking eight pecan pies; 4)
stuffing everyone’s stocking full of milk chocolate. My sister had
replied that these traditions were integral to the joy of Christmas. I
knew that her response was reasonable. But I was literally unable to
control myself around sugar, and I worried about containing my fits of
madness. I was also concerned about our family’s ability to prevent the
remaining cats from dying, though my sister assured me she’d implemented
a system to achieve this; I was worried, too, that no one would like the
cheap, ugly Christmas presents I’d got them; I’d also become aware of my
strong urge to inform my sister’s sister-in-law Kunda, a shy,
forty-four-year-old neurosurgeon and Canadian Medical Officer of Health,
that I knew she’d been trying to get pregnant, and that if she’d accept
my help I could make it happen, despite my sister’s warning that no one
was supposed to know Kunda was “trying” and that I must not accost her;
finally, I was concerned, as always during family visits, about the
safety and comfort of my nieces around our uncle, who was a pedophile,
especially since the previous Christmas, when my sister and I weren’t
vigilant enough, I’d caught him rubbing the butt of the elder girl, then
six years old, in a dark, empty room. That, too, my sister assured me,
was under control: the girls would never be left alone with him, and at
night they’d sleep on cots in her room. Everyone in our family meant
well and wanted to be a family.</p>
<p>I know too, K, that you cringe whenever I mention the pedophile
thing, and feel that it should not be placed in any story, because it
overwhelms it and is too terrible for words. But I’d like to point out
that my nieces are two beautiful, talented, and privileged girls, who
see their grand-uncle only a few days a year; and that our uncle is not
a bad man, just a sick one. So please quell any squeamishness or horror
and bear in mind that it could be worse.</p>
<p>I’d also like to say—regarding the Christmas miracle—that it was my
elder niece who instigated the Kamikaze Cat Training, not me. I have two
nieces but only one goddaughter. And though I’ve abandoned Catholicism,
the cult that I was born into, and am one of about eight godmothers, I
take my duty seriously. Perhaps I can be forgiven at least one mistake I
made that holiday.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Clara died first. She was eaten by a coyote. She was a nice cat. I
don’t expect you to care about the cats. Clara was a long-haired Maine
coon mix who loved to be petted. She went outside to use the bathroom,
or frolic, or whatever cats do, around sunset, and never came back.</p>
<p>The problem was an influx of hungry coyotes into the development
where my sister lived. As the town crawled up the mountain, coyotes,
bears, and lynxes were displaced from their habitats and wandered down
the mountain, where they discovered the delicious new food, cat. In
September, when my sister’s family barbecued on their back deck, they
saw coyotes trot through the pines at their yard’s edge.</p>
<p>Clara was eaten in October. Afterward, my nieces cried, blahblahblah.
My sister, too; Clara had been her first cat. And through the years,
whenever my sister felt sad about anything—fight, failed test, car
accident, etc.—Clara sensed it, came to her, and sat in her lap.</p>
<p>My sister instituted a lockdown. The cats got one outing, at dusk, to
use the bathroom in the yard. They were let out for five minutes,
watched, and lured back in with cooked shrimp.</p>
<p>The other cats were Chocolate, a diabetic brown male with postnasal
drip who made stinky farts and loved all people, but especially loved to
sit on the chest of my brother-in-law (who once spent five thousand
dollars on an operation to save Chocolate’s pancreas and life); Patches,
a brindle who loved playing in the bathroom sink; Simmy, a bony Siamese
loner who fought other cats and never purred; and Crow, a black cat.
Crow was fit, above average size, and a mouser. She left dead mice in my
sister’s bed, which displeased my sister, because Crow first bit out the
eyes. Crow did not curl up in anyone’s lap. But she slept on my elder
niece’s bed most nights.</p>
<p>Wildfires burned throughout the Monashee Mountains that fall; though
it was now December, there’d been no snow. Rather than disappearing,
bears, lynxes, and coyotes foraged in the developments, thinking it
still time to fatten up. Patches was eaten next. One evening, she
sneaked past the yard’s edge when no one was looking, probably to
investigate a mouse smell, and never came back.</p>
<p>My sister made a new rule: no cats outside.</p>
<p>But two weeks later Simmy, the Siamese who fought other cats, sped
past my brother-in-law one night as he opened the door to the deck. When
he lunged for her, she slipped into the forest. My sister’s family
walked the woods until midnight, calling her name.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>When I arrived in Revelstoke for the holiday, everyone was still
shell-shocked about the cat deaths. My elder niece, Adira, a pale,
black-haired tomboy, would occasionally mutter, “We shouldn’t have let
her out”—about Clara or Patches, I guess—and my sister would say that if
she hadn’t been able to go out at all she wouldn’t have been happy; and
my niece would say, “But she’d be alive”; and so forth.</p>
<p>My sister’s house was large—its kitchen opened to a dining area and a
“circle room” with a fifty-foot solar-panelled glass dome—but contained
few rooms. So I was given my elder niece’s second-floor bedroom, my
brothers shared my younger niece’s room, and our mother and our uncle
took the sleeper couch in the library, on whose carpet Crow often
peed.</p>
<p>Because we were aware of the traumatic cat deaths, we all behaved
well, even me, and when our uncle knelt down and spread his arms wide
and said to my nieces, “Come give Uncle D a kiss!” and I had to watch my
nieces tense up, walk stiffly toward him, and let him grab their faces
and kiss their lips, I didn’t say anything. I just smiled widely and
continued to behave, that afternoon, by not eating any gumdrops while my
family spent several hours baking and constructing the gingerbread
mansion, and we all felt, I think, good after the mansion was completed.
It was late afternoon on December 23rd, and I probably never would have
instituted the Kamikaze Training if it hadn’t been for what happened
after the gingerbread mansion was finished, which was that we all went
for a walk in the woods.</p>
<p>The fires hadn’t reached Revelstoke. The ground in the forest was a
soft red-and-bronze carpet of pine needles, and the fields around the
forest were gold brush. Revelstoke is set beside a river formed by
glaciers circled by six-thousand-foot-high craggy mountains, and the sky
above was velveteen blue. We were all breathing hard, laughing, running
along the forest path when my younger niece giggled, pointed to an
opening in the pines, and said, “What’s that thing?” and ran off the
path, and my mother said, “Lily, be careful, don’t touch it,” but she
was touching it, and it turned out to be Simmy. The cat’s mouth was
open, her gums shrunk, her teeth exposed, her tan torso gutted. My
brother-in-law wrapped the cat remainder in dead leaves and carried it
home, and then he and my uncle worked for an hour to dig a hole in the
frozen back yard.</p>
<p>We all felt, I think, eager to bring calm back to Christmas, so after
dinner my brother-in-law went to bathe, as did my mother; my sister took
refuge in doing dishes; my brothers and my younger niece played Super
Mario Kart together on one living-room couch; and, on the other, my
elder niece, Adira, read a book, one of her easy-readers, “Ramona
Quimby, Age 8.” My uncle entered the room, still dirty from digging the
cat-hole, and said kindly, “Adira, would you like a foot rub?” and the
girl tensed and a small “Nnnneh” sound came out of her mouth, and my
uncle sat down next to her and began rubbing her feet.</p>
<p>I felt the Bartonella bacteria in my head move. They had been fed
when I ate my dinner of chicken and broccoli. I’d been careful not to
eat a speck of sugar, but even the carbohydrates in broccoli could feed
them. I felt them grow strong and say to me, “There’s a gingerbread
house on the counter. Its frosting is sugar and cream, it’s soft and
warm, you can eat some!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Adira sat stiffly, staring at her book but not reading; my
uncle had pulled her legs onto his lap and was kneading her calves. I
sat in a leather chair nearby, not reading, either, because I heard the
Bartonella bacteria yelling, “Sugar! Sugar!” I don’t know how many
minutes passed before my sister asked our uncle, from the kitchen,
whether Adira had said that she wanted a foot rub. Our uncle answered,
in a soothing, asset-management-specialist’s voice, Yes, she had; my
sister responded in a clipped voice that she thought she’d heard my
niece say, “Nnnneh.” Our uncle continued to rub my niece’s feet, and
then my sister said angrily to my niece that she needed help in the
kitchen, and Adira put her book down and walked into the kitchen without
looking right or left and said quietly, “What do you want me to do?”</p>
<p>My sister said, “Dry these dishes.”</p>
<p>Our uncle went downstairs to shower, and I helped do dishes, too,
because sugar was in the kitchen—and not just the gingerbread house. In
the cupboards, I knew, there were Mint Milano cookies. Full dark pulsed
outside the sliding glass doors to the deck, and a coyote
yip-yip-yip-yipped in the woods. When my sister looked over her shoulder
through the dark glass, I just dipped my finger into the gingerbread
mansion’s white trim. From the living room, my brothers saw me do it,
and one told me loudly not to eat the mansion with my fingers, because
that was gross and others would get my germs, but Bartonella said,
“Ignore him. Do again.” And so I finger-dipped again, and the other twin
yelled that I was disgusting and was destroying the mansion, and that
hurt my feelings and made me angry, so that before my sister went to bed
I cornered her in the empty kitchen and told her that I did not think my
nieces felt comfortable when our uncle kissed their lips, and that we
should stop it. My sister, in a stretched voice, reminded me that
grand-uncles kissing grand-nieces was normal, and that she’d spoken to a
professional family counsellor about correct procedures in these cases,
and the real me said, “O.K.,” but Bartonella me, who was larger than me
and lived outside me, said, “Not O.K.”</p>
<p>My sister added that she was the mother.</p>
<p>The real me said, “I know.”</p>
<p>But Bartonella me said, “You are the mother. Big deal. I am the
godmother!”</p>
<p>The counsellor had warned her, my sister said, that telling her
daughters our concerns would damage their psychological development, and
that the issue must never be addressed.</p>
<p>My sister said, “Promise you won’t say anything about Uncle D to the
girls,” and the real me said, “O.K.,” and she said, “Also, don’t bring
up the fact that Kunda’s trying to conceive when Kunda comes over—it’s
secret,” and I said, “I won’t,” but Bartonella said, “Eat sugar.”</p>
<p>The only notable thing about Kunda, besides that she was a hot, nice,
Hindi immigrant who had put herself through college by waitressing, is
that she worshipped her husband, a pimply blond government secretary in
her department. She met him when she was thirty-seven, and after they
started dating she told me, “I love him.” I said, “Really? He’s so ugly,
pink-faced, and blond,” and she said, “He’s a good one, a keeper.” She
always worked the same schedule as he, so that no other female official
could “get him.” For the past five years, apparently, she’d been failing
to have his baby, owing to “mystery infertility,” and was racked by
shame.</p>
<p>At 3 a.m. I woke and ate half the gingerbread mansion. I’m not proud
of that, but I do blame it for the rest of the story.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>At 7 a.m., I awakened dizzy, wanting more sugar, already tasting it
in my mouth. When I entered the barely lit circle room and found Adira
alone, playing Super Mario Kart on a couch, it was Bartonella who said,
“Kamikaze Training.”</p>
<p>On the loft stairs, the large black cat, Crow, curled and watched.
Beside my niece, the fat brown cat, Chocolate, licked its rear.</p>
<p>My niece paused her game and said, “What?” and Bartonella explained
that I’d pay her to say a few phrases. The real me remembered my
sister’s warning, but Bartonella said, “The therapist’s wrong.”</p>
<p>Bartonella felt that our difference of opinion stemmed from the
previous holiday, at our uncle’s Texas ranch, when my sister hadn’t seen
what I had. Christmas night, she’d played backgammon with most of our
family in the living room; I’d wandered the house looking for a quiet
place to read, and gone into the dark den, where we’d all watched a
movie earlier. She hadn’t seen my elder niece asleep on her belly on the
couch—or feigning sleep—and our uncle seated behind her, massaging her
ass. She hadn’t had to think, Christ, why me? or notice that my niece’s
tiny hands were clenched. I’d told my niece I had a present for her
upstairs, and she’d vaulted up and run with me to my bedroom, where I
gave her an old rubber eraser; I’d got her out of there, but like a
thousand-per-cent wuss I said nothing to my uncle. Later I told my
sister what had happened, said we should do something, and she said we’d
be more vigilant. But she hadn’t seen what I had.</p>
<p>So, about fifteen feet from the couch, I squatted down in the posture
that our uncle always adopted when he spread his arms and said, “Come
give Uncle D a kiss,” and I informed my niece that I was going to tell
her to give me a kiss, and that she should respond by saying she didn’t
feel like giving me one, and that if she followed my instructions I’d
pay her a dollar.</p>
<p>My niece started playing her game again.</p>
<p>I said, “I’ll pay you a dollar!”</p>
<p>She smiled a little. She said, “Aunt D, do you know what my allowance
is?”</p>
<p>I said, “Five dollars?”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>Her hand waved upward.</p>
<p>I said, “Is your allowance ten dollars?”</p>
<p>Guiltily, she nodded.</p>
<p>On the screen, she leaped over a mushroom.</p>
<p>She whispered, “I don’t want to say it.”</p>
<p>I knelt in his posture, I opened my arms the way he did, and I
growled in his voice, being careful not to be so loud I’d wake
everybody, “Come give me a kiss!”</p>
<p>Her eyes were wide.</p>
<p>I said, “Now you say, ‘I don’t feel kissy.’ I’ll pay you ten
dollars.”</p>
<p>On the stairs, Crow got up. Her black pupils went large.</p>
<p>On the couch, my niece shook her head.</p>
<p>Bartonella exhorted my niece to say it. If she can’t say it she’s a
sucker, Bartonella said. If she can’t say it she’s doomed.</p>
<p>My niece said she didn’t want to say it.</p>
<p>I kept exhorting. I offered her the choice of two phrases—“I don’t
feel kissy right now” or “No thanks, I must go clean my room”—and was
telling her again that I’d pay her ten dollars, when my niece started
breathing as if she couldn’t get enough air. Her posture wasn’t good;
she’d hunched.</p>
<p>She whispered, “It’s too scary.”</p>
<p>My real self said, Stop, you’re being a jerk, you made her cry, jerk;
but Bartonella said, Someone’s gotta train her.</p>
<p>Bartonella said, “Adira, if you say it, I’ll buy you a ruby
necklace.”</p>
<p>She looked at me.</p>
<p>I added, “And matching earrings.”</p>
<p>I knew from experience that one could buy a “real” ruby necklace and
earrings on eBay for ten dollars.</p>
<p>My niece looked down. Wiped her cheek. Said, “O.K.”</p>
<p>Crow licked her right paw. She stared at me.</p>
<p>I squatted down and said in my uncle’s voice, “Come give me a
kiss!”</p>
<p>She breathed shallowly, and whispered in a high, artificial voice, “I
don’t feel—”; Chocolate farted, a smell of cheese/egg filled the room,
and at that second my uncle walked in and yelled, “Hellooo! What’s
everybody doing?”</p>
<p>He paused, sniffed.</p>
<p>Crow’s tail whipped.</p>
<p>I said, “Nothing”; Adira said, “Nothing.”</p>
<p>My sister entered behind my uncle and announced that she’d found a
mouse by her bed. She held it up by the tail. Its paws dangled. Where
its eyes had been were deep holes. She stared at Crow and said, “Crow, I
don’t want you to do this again.” Crow’s head lifted. She closed and
reopened her eyes, then stood, stretched, and padded up the loft stairs.
My sister watched her go. Then she saw my niece’s face. She looked at
me. Her brow furrowed. She asked my niece why she was crying. Was it
something Aunt D had said? Bartonella said,
“Ohnoooyourefucked!!!!!­!!!!!­!!!!!­” and my niece said calmly, “I was
remembering Simmy.” Then my sister started crying, and I did, too—for
fun and because I wanted sugar so bad—and my niece re-started her video
game and my uncle baked us all cinnamon buns for breakfast.</p>
<p>That afternoon, in preparation for guests, we made forty dozen sugar
cookies in the shape of jingle bells, angels, and snowmen. My sister
watched me eat three, and said carefully, “Drip your I.V. yet?” and I
said, “Yeah,” although I had not, and decorating cookies was so much fun
that everyone got along well up until the tragedy.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>It’s hard to describe one family frosting cookies, or maybe not worth
the effort, but: picture bowls with colored frosting on a kitchen
island. Picture my younger niece, a round-faced, brown-eyed six-year-old
in a loose red dress sitting on a stool at the island; across from her
was my mother, a plump sixty-something Swede with blond hair and a
puffy, sad face, bent over giving directions like “Use pink for the
bell, Lily,” and “Why don’t you put three Red Hots on the holly?” I was
also frosting, beside my younger niece, only I was creating, using
colored jimmies, bespoke snowmen who resembled family members; I’d
secretly frosted an extra bump onto one and given it curly black
licorice hair to make it represent a pregnant Kunda. Outside the
kitchen’s sliding glass doors, the sun shone upon golden-brown grass; it
was fifty degrees; everyone was happy. My sister laid wheat noodles in
vats for lasagna; her husband dumped sixteen cans of corn syrup into
four mixing bowls to make eight pecan pies; my elder niece sat across
from me, cutting cookies into squares and icing them yellow to resemble
SpongeBob; our uncle, a handsome, red-haired retired asset-management
specialist in his mid-sixties who loved to ride horses, build furniture,
and collect antique books, sat on my younger niece’s other side and
frosted cookies as best he could, without particular imagination,
slabbing pink on a heart and yellow on a bell, and holding it up for
everyone and saying, “Hey, guys. I did a bell. See?” From time to time
he dropped his butter knife, and when he did he’d say, “Whoops, I
dropped my butter knife,” and get down and crawl around underneath my
younger niece’s stool; at which my niece, whose bare legs dangled from
her dress, giggled nervously. Then our uncle would pop over to the sink,
near where my sister was working, and say, “Excuse me, my knife’s dirty.
I’m going to wash it.” He dropped his knife five times, I guess.</p>
<p>I know, K, that you’ll protest that that’s not realistic: how can a
man drop a butter knife five times? I’m sorry to say that it’s easy—the
fingers spread, the knife drops. And you bet that part of me observed
the proceedings and thought, This is crazy, I’m going to kill something,
I’m gonna tear down walls or some shit! But the rational me thought, So
he crawls under her stool, maybe sees panties, so what? Respect your
sister’s wishes. Everybody wants a peaceful Christmas.</p>
<p>Also, I was distracted by the fact that my sister was preparing
wheat-based lasagna for dinner: my sister and my elder niece had both
had Lyme disease, and were warned by doctors never to eat dairy
(mucus-forming), soy (goitrogenic), or wheat, which spiked blood sugar,
caused inflammation, and depressed the immune system. I knew that I was
not supposed to criticize my sister’s food choices, because she’d told
me not to, but the third time our uncle dropped his butter knife I felt
my frustration surge, and said, “Nina, why can’t we make chicken
stir-fry? You’re not supposed to eat wheat!” and my sister replied that
guests were arriving, and everyone liked lasagna, and I said, “They
might like gluten-free lasagna,” and she said that no one liked
gluten-free lasagna, and added that normally she did not eat lasagna,
but today was Christmas Eve, she was making it, and I needed to lay off
her food choices, and outside a V of fat geese floated through the slate
sky, and I thought wistfully how, if I could muscle-test Kunda to
identify the supplements that would best replenish her iodine and
support her adrenals, I could get her pregnant, and our uncle’s butter
knife clattered and he said, “Whoops! I’m clumsy!” and crawled under my
younger niece’s chair and the kid’s legs kicked, and I knew I shouldn’t
say anything, I knew I shouldn’t cause trouble, but I felt dizzy. I saw
Crow, who was crouched on the loft stairs, shimmer and float above and
beside herself, as if she were three cats, and I yelled, “But I see that
you have wheat bread on your counter!” and my sister said coldly,
“That’s for the girls,” and I said, “But they shouldn’t eat wheat
either—it’s a Frankenfood!” and I was describing wheat’s
thyroid-hampering properties when my sister turned to our mother, who
was petting Chocolate, and said, “Mother, I said don’t pet Chocolate,
stop!”</p>
<p>Our mother was allergic to most animals. But my sister’s reprimand
probably hurt her feelings, so she ushered my nieces into the circle
room and told them a Jesus story. One about his entering a town and
healing a blind man by spitting on his eyes. As our mother spoke, my
sister banged pots and pans. Our mother always loved Christ, but she
probably loved him more after her husband died and she was left broke,
not fully bipolar but not right in the head, with four kids age six and
under. She prayed to Jesus for help, and later that week our father’s
older brother, a confirmed bachelor and an asset-management specialist,
offered to let her bring us all to his ranch and live with him, and to
send her kids to college. To thank him, our mother cleaned and cooked
for our uncle and the arrangement worked out, mostly. To thank God, she
attended church twice weekly and spoke with Jesus for an hour every
day.</p>
<p>From the kitchen, my sister ordered our mother to stop proselytizing;
our mother kept speaking. Her voice was sweet in a way it rarely was.
Our mother loved Jesus. I didn’t condemn her. Personally, I agreed that
many Jewish guys were extra-talented, kind, and good with touch, and I’d
had “relationships” with emotionally distant, mostly unavailable Jewish
guys myself, so I sympathized; my older sister did not.</p>
<p>When my sister repeated her request, our mother yelled, “Then Jesus
asked, ‘What do you see?’ and the blind man said, ‘I see people! They
look like trees, walking around!’ ” and, temper shot, my sister ordered
my nieces to play in their rooms.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Everyone slumped in the living room. Our uncle asked who wanted to go
for a walk; no one did. Our mother sneezed. Our uncle said, “I guess
I’ll go by myself, then!” and left. We all read—my siblings books, my
mother a magazine called Real Simple. The bells’ carol played and the
tree’s lights twinkled. I was reading a biography of my favorite writer,
who at forty-five begged Stalin to be allowed to finish his work before
he was shot by a firing squad, when we heard a thump thump thump in the
hall.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” one of my brothers said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” my sister said.</p>
<p>We heard shrieks and giggles.</p>
<p>“Jump!” a voice cried.</p>
<p>We entered the hall and saw that my nieces had used their old tights
to affix a coyote to the bannister. It was a donkey piñata, really; but
they’d glued red-brown felt to it and taped coyote ears to its head.
They’d cut holes where the donkey eyes had been, and in the holes they’d
taped Doritos. My elder niece dangled a cat toy on a wire and made its
attractive end bounce near the Doritos. Chocolate panted and lunged at
the toy madly, fatly, his belly heaving. But each time he failed to
reach it and fell with a thump. Crow watched from the top of the
stairs.</p>
<p>Adira peered at her.</p>
<p>“Crow!” she urged. “Get it! Come!”</p>
<p>My sister asked what they were doing.</p>
<p>Adira muttered.</p>
<p>My sister said, “ ‘Kamikaze Cat Training’???”</p>
<p>“We’re teaching them to fight coyotes.”</p>
<p>Her blue-black hair flared, tangled, around her shoulders.</p>
<p>“We’d train Crow,” Adira said, “but she won’t come near Chocolate. He
bullies her and she’s scared.”</p>
<p>“First of all,” my sister said, “that’s not a coyote. It’s a donkey.
Chocolate does not see a coyote. He sees Doritos.” Cats were not smart,
she said. Cats were dumb. Crow was not being trained. She was watching
the girls act stupid. No cat could kill a coyote. Furthermore, no cat
was in danger, because no cat was ever going outside.</p>
<p>My sister said that she needed help in the kitchen, and told my
nieces to clean up their mess.</p>
<p>I’m sure other families have fallen into bad holiday moods over
similarly trivial incidents.</p>
<p>But I felt a sadness. I couldn’t knock it; I don’t know why. At any
rate, I had to contemplate the prospect of my family eating wheat
lasagna, which had goitrogenic effects; though, regarding that, they
didn’t believe me. My family found my health ideas absurd. My brothers,
both dentists, had told me that my nutritionist work should be illegal,
because only doctors are qualified to dispense supplements; my sister
said that I’d never make rent as a nutritionist, and that I should give
up. I was forbidden to offer Kunda the most common-sense advice. I
considered, still with wonder, my clients who’d got pregnant: a dozen
women in their mid-forties who had each had three failed I.V.F.
treatments before they did protocols with me. Many had had repeat
miscarriages, several had ovarian cysts, and all had tried
unsuccessfully for years; but once we had replenished their minerals,
supported their thyroid and adrenals, used herbs to balance their
hormones, and changed their diets, they’d all conceived. They’d all had
healthy, non-retarded babies. They’d sent me referrals, but not enough.
My sister was right: I couldn’t pay my bills. I’d spent a few hundred
bucks on Google AdWords, but I made bad ads and they didn’t work. My Web
site was ugly. I’d had some unsatisfied clients, old ladies who’d gained
weight instead of losing it, and they’d Yelped me, calling me a quack. I
thought about how, if I helped Kunda, I’d have a district medical
officer’s Yelp endorsement, and how many clients that’d get me. I didn’t
give a fig about Kunda’s sensitivity; I was dizzy, from actual dizziness
or from grandiosity; I thought, So what if my degree’s an Internet
diploma?</p>
<p>I was slicing onions when I noticed, beyond the kitchen’s glass
doors, my mother standing in the back yard, staring contemplatively into
the distant pines, under that pale vast Shuswap sky.</p>
<p>My sister said, “What’s she doing?”</p>
<p>We wandered toward the glass—my sister and I, her husband, my nieces
behind him—and saw that my mother was watching Chocolate, who was
hunched privately at yard’s edge, depositing number twos into the grass;
as we observed, a handsome coyote the size of a large dog, but more
yellow-gray and with a long narrow snout, strolled into the yard, bent
down to Chocolate as if to whisper in his ear, and bit his throat. It
pulled, ripping flesh, and the cat convulsed. The coyote plucked up
Chocolate’s body and trotted into the trees.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>All I remember of the ensuing chaos is my sister’s husband shouting
in a high, almost teen-age voice, “You weren’t supposed to let the cat
out! Why’d you let the cat out? You weren’t supposed to do that!”</p>
<p>Apparently, our mother had thought the cats were still allowed
outside to use the bathroom at dusk. She was watching Chocolate, she
explained. “I was right there,” she said.</p>
<p>We had thirty minutes until our guests arrived.</p>
<p>I dripped medicine in my room. I’d put it off because there’s a thing
called a Herxheimer reaction: when you kill thousands of bacteria the
remaining billions heighten their activity. I often hallucinated after
dripping. I disliked feeling cold fluid slide through my veins. Also,
inserting tubes into my arm-port was embarrassing and I tried to do it
privately, so as not to repulse my family. Now I had to make a
sixty-minute I.V. drip in thirty, so the pressure was high. I was lying
on my bed, feeling logy, when the door swung open. A second later, Crow
jumped onto the bed. A minute later, a hand tapped the door; Adira asked
to enter.</p>
<p>I said it was her room.</p>
<p>She was wearing her gray track pants and a SpongeBob T-shirt. She
hopped onto the bed and lay to my left. She asked what I was doing; I
said I was dripping; she nodded. She’d been “tick sick,” so she knew
what it was. She reached across me to pet Crow; Crow let her. She read
her book, then said, “I don’t want Crow to die,” into the pillow. I told
her not to be stupid; she said, “Someone will let her outside, I know
it,” and I said, “You’re being stupid” and she said, “You’re stupid,”
and I said, “You’re stupid like SpongeBob” and she said, “SpongeBob’s
awesome, I love SpongeBob!” and I swore that no one would let Crow out.
Then I looked to my right and saw an old woman, as dark as night, bent
and withered but still strong and smiling grimly. She had sharp teeth
and yellow eyes, and was crouching. I jumped. My niece asked why I’d
jumped. I explained that I’d dripped too fast. My niece said reasonably,
“Why don’t you slow it down?” and I said because we had guests coming. I
wiped my eyes, gook came out; I looked at my fingers, they’d puffed like
sausages. My niece asked what I’d got her for Christmas, and I said
something cheap and small, which was true.</p>
<p>She smiled and said, “I bet I like it.”</p>
<p>I said, “Listen, tardface, no one’s letting Crow outside.”</p>
<p>We slept.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The thing with nieces, K, is that they just happen. You may be a
broke, semi-jobless loser who’s never loved, hates kids, and is repelled
by marriage, and suddenly your successful sibling may have these things:
babies that look like you and know your name. And there’s nothing you
can do. I remember this one time, the year I took a job in Vancouver
(the worst place on earth) to be near my sister, and she drove down to
visit with her husband and my nieces, Lily still a baby, Adira then two,
this wild fast skinny thing with an elf face and ebony hair, and we
hiked through Lighthouse Park, along a trail that wound two miles
through thousand-year-old cedars and descended steeply to an inlet
called Starboat Cove, and my niece ran its length but on the way back
got tired, and I asked if she wanted a piggy-back ride. I probably said,
“Smellface, want a ride?” and she said, “Yes!” and my older sister got
an odd look and asked my niece, “Do you want me to give you a piggy-back
ride?”; there was a pause, these white clouds moved in the perfect sky
above the cove, the ocean smacked saltily, fishily on the rocks below
our feet, and my niece composed her face as if contemplating how to put
things; I knew my sister would always be her one love—we all knew
that—but she said, in her breathy two-year-old voice, “Sometimes when
your heart is big, all you really want is Aunt D,” and I was, like,
“Great, I’m fucked, I’m going to like this kid, this niece thing,
forever.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>We’d slept through dinner. I was glad, because I’d decided to starve
myself in order to starve the Bartonella. My sister offered me food and
I declined, though ravenous. I saw by the remnants on the counter that
my family had consumed ten pans of buttered squash, twelve loaves of
bread, and eight vats of lasagna. I was surprised but didn’t dwell on
it. Holidays make people hungry. My relatives are fit and they exercise
and have good metabolisms. However, the sight of ricotta droppings made
me nauseous, and when I pulled the trash compactor out from the counter
I saw thousands of silverfish sliding atop squash peels. My stomach
rolled; they sparkled and slithered. I closed the drawer. My sister
asked what was wrong; I said nothing, opened the trash, saw only squash
rinds. I helped carry eight pecan pies into the circle room, where
relatives were settling into couches, and a strange thing happened, or I
guess not so strange, when you consider that I’d dripped my I.V. too
fast; instead of my beloved family and pleasant in-laws gathered around
the tree, sitting on the circle room’s several couches, I saw animals.
My sister’s father-in-law, a witty, retired postal worker who was now
making well-deserved cash selling disaster insurance, was a wily wild
boar, wearing plaid pants, a blue polo, and a bow tie, with a bald
boar’s head and bristles coming out of his large tan ears. He was
telling my brother-in-law—a timid giraffe in a blue T-shirt, with two
hooves poking out of each jean leg—about some fire/tornado/hurricane
packages he’d sold in new developments, and his snout nodded as his maw
said, “Went like hotcakes.”</p>
<p>My sister’s mother-in-law, in real life a beautiful textile designer,
was a kangaroo, her soft brown legs splayed on the couch, knitting next
to my younger niece, who looked up at her adoringly; my sister, I’m
sorry to say—don’t think badly of me, blame the Bartonella—was a
Chihuahua who went yipping around the room bringing everyone a slice of
pie by carrying each plate in her mouth, and whenever her mouth was free
she’d yip, “How are you? We have mulled wine!” Everyone was talking
happily. The kangaroo told my sister in a warbly voice, while stroking
her pelt with one paw, that she and her husband had coyotes in their
back yard, too, and had kept their cats inside for years now; she looked
over to the boar, who was adjusting his bow tie, and said, “Greg’s
thinking of shooting some! Good money for the pelts!” and my sister
panted and yipped, “Let’s not talk about that right now! I don’t want to
upset the girls! It’s Christmas!” and the kangaroo said, “Of course!”
and my mother, a flushed potbellied pig who wore a pink velour dress and
was seated next to a hairy gentleman with dark fur and a fedora,
snorted, “Marianne, how are your fair-trade scarves doing? Are your
scarves in a department store?” and all these people—or animals, I have
no idea—were eating pecan pie. I knew I was hallucinating, but the part
I felt sure was real was that they were consuming eight pies, and the
Chihuahua yipped, “Cassandra! Do you want a piece, maybe a small
one?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. I knew she didn’t want me to eat it, even when she
offered me the plate in her mouth, because her tail flattened and her
mouth growled, so I declined and the Chihuahua said, “Adira? Pie?” and
my niece, beside me on the couch, accepted. As she ate, a hairy
orangutan with a big pink nose and beady eyes, who in real life was her
uncle, the secretary, gnashed his teeth from across the room and said,
“Adira, you’ve gotten taller! If you eat another bite of pie, you’ll be
taller than your mother!” and the Chihuahua jumped up and down angrily
and said, “Nononono, not yet!” and a beautiful gray-skinned elephant
wearing a purple sari, seated on the couch beside the orangutan, touched
his shoulder with her trunk, and her gray lips said, “She’s got another
year before she’ll catch her mother,” and, beside me, my niece
grinned.</p>
<p>I don’t know, K, why my inflamed brain turned my district medical
officer sister-in-law, a tall Hindi woman with wide cheeks and curly
black hair, into an elephant—I think it was the association of elephants
and Hinduism, plus I’m racist. At any rate, all was well. I’d accepted
that I was hallucinating and decided to retire, pleading illness, when
the Chihuahua declared it time for the most important Christmas Eve
tradition: everyone must open one gift from under the tree; both my
nieces exclaimed “Yay!” and in the ensuing pause the hairy gentleman
across the room, who wore a fedora and a gray suit and had gray fur on
his chin, appraised my elder niece and said, “Adira, you look very
attractive this evening.”</p>
<p>No one spoke. The kangaroo frowned and her needles paused; the
potbellied pig turned pinker. I felt my niece push backward, into the
couch. I thought, Ah well, it’s done. I don’t know why I thought that,
except that suddenly I tasted corn syrup, lard, and stale pecans in my
mouth; I don’t know who put them there. The Chihuahua yipped, “Uncle D!
You should compliment Lily! Lily has a new dress on and a bow in her
hair! Adira’s wearing old track pants and a dirty T-shirt! Lily is the
one who looks pretty!” The distinguished gentleman turned to my younger
niece, who was now admiring her own dress, and said, “Lily, you also
look very pretty.”</p>
<p>Everyone observed my nieces.</p>
<p>As the pie sugar hit my blood I felt a surge of—adrenaline? neuron
death? It was true about the track pants—for the last year, my elder
niece had worn nothing but nylon track pants, because anything else
bothered her skin. The word “skin” flashed through my mind as I
considered this, and I felt wired, alert, crazed, and I saw the elephant
across the room. Her gray skin was wrinkled, and as she peered at the
grandfather clock in the hall I remembered that wrinkles indicate iodine
deficiency, and that the elephant was trying to get pregnant, and I
yelled, “Kunda, do you think lately you have wrinkles?”</p>
<p>The kangaroo frowned and said, “Everyone has wrinkles!”</p>
<p>The Chihuahua jumped up and down and said, “Yes, that was rude!
Everyone has wrinkles!”</p>
<p>I was implementing a business strategy from a book called “How to
Master the Art of Selling,” whereby you ask your potential clients
questions they’re bound to say “yes” to. You start with something easy,
like “It’s a nice day out, isn’t it?” and keep going. Once they get in
the pattern of saying “Yes,” they can’t stop—that’s the idea. I knew
certain things about Kunda, because she was a woman suffering from
infertility, plus she was an elephant, so I said, “Kunda, I suspect your
body temperature’s low. Do you often feel cold?”</p>
<p>The elephant stared at me. Her trunk curled down. She said, “I do
feel cold often. Why?”</p>
<p>I looked at her gray, bald head and sad brown eyes. I said, “Kunda,
your eyebrows are thinning at the outer edges, aren’t they? In fact, I
don’t think you have eyebrows at all! Are you losing hair in the shower
drain?”</p>
<p>The elephant’s hooves went to her forehead. Her mouth dropped
open.</p>
<p>The orangutan next to her frowned.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at me.</p>
<p>I thought, Yes!</p>
<p>I said, “Kunda, do you crave sugar in the afternoon? Salt?
Caffeine?”</p>
<p>The elephant peered at me. Slowly she said, “Yes. Why?”</p>
<p>“Ignore her!” the Chihuahua yipped. “She’s tick sick! She has Lyme
disease!”</p>
<p>Beside me, my older niece said, “Aunt D, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>The kangaroo said that she didn’t think this was a nice
conversation.</p>
<p>I peered at the elephant, on the couch. “Kunda,” I said. “You look
big to me. Do you have belly fat? Are you having trouble losing
weight?”</p>
<p>In reality, K, Kunda was slender. But I knew that women in their
forties are paranoid about everything, and for no reason that I
understand I was intent on showing Kunda that she was suffering from
iodine deficiency.</p>
<p>I said, “You’re cold and fat around your middle, right?”</p>
<p>The elephant nodded.</p>
<p>The orangutan yelled, “I won’t stand for this! You’re saying things
that are totally inappropriate!” It came at me from across the room; I
was afraid, in fact terrified, and my niece whispered, “Aunt D, stop,”
and I yelled, “Too bad, Kunda. Those are all symptoms of a deficiency in
iodine, the mineral most essential for fertility. That’s why you can’t
conceive!”</p>
<p>The orangutan stopped inches from me. “That’s enough!” he said.</p>
<p>The elephant turned mauve. She rose clumsily and headed toward the
kitchen.</p>
<p>I struggled to frame my closer as a “Yes” question. I yelled, “Kunda,
if a cheap nutritionist in-law who charges cheap rates could help you
fix these problems cheaply, you’d want help, wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p>Suddenly it was done. Instead of an elephant I saw a lithe,
forty-something Indian woman striding toward my sister’s back door. She
opened the door, closed it carefully behind her, and walked into the
dark yard. My sister, not a Chihuahua but a tallish blond investment
banker with great skin and runner’s legs, twisted my right wrist. She
said, “Everything you said is unacceptable.”</p>
<p>Some of our relatives—our gray-suited uncle, his mouth curled as if a
friend had told him a joke; our mother, in her pink velour dress; my
sister’s husband’s parents, the ex-postal worker with his bald head and
bristly black brows and his slope-faced, brown-eyed wife—stared at me,
appalled, from a couch; on a love seat, one of my brothers leaned toward
the other and whispered, “We might commit her; Nina will pay.”</p>
<p>Beyond the glass dome of the circle room was clear black sky; under
the Christmas tree sat mounds of gifts decked in sparkling gold-and-red
paper and tied with organza ribbons.</p>
<p>I said, “I apologize.”</p>
<p>I kept saying it.</p>
<p>My sister sighed and said that someone should go to Kunda; her
husband said that he would, but my sister said, “No, let me.” She walked
through the kitchen, slid the heavy glass door open, and strode out.
Behind her, the black cat sauntered across the kitchen tiles and out the
door and into the grass. It padded left, past the swing set, and headed
into the trees.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>That’s how we reëntered the forest, now frigid and pitch black.
Though it was late, all of us lurched through the woods, calling the
cat’s name. My sister didn’t own enough flashlights for everyone, so we
searched in clusters and pairs. The trees were dark, still shapes; I
heard twigs crack and people in distant places call the cat’s name. It
was terrible and no one spoke much, but at one point my sister ended up
next to me, and said, “I don’t want to discuss this evening right now,
because I’m too upset, but…” She’d worked hard to make the holiday nice
for everyone, she said, and to enable everyone to get along. She’d
worked hard to make me happy, too, and it seemed that all I wanted to do
was criticize her and make people upset; I wasn’t myself, and she was
curious—what had she done to me, to deserve this? And I was, like,
Christ. I felt terrible. I knew she’d spent days shopping for gifts,
party favors, groceries, stocking stuffers; she’d bought us all snow
boards and ski passes—time she barely had, since she worked eighty hours
a week at her banking job. She tried so hard and no one thanked her.
“I’m so sorry,” I said. “I didn’t mean to, I’m sick—” and she said,
“Don’t use that excuse.” She’d had Lyme disease, too, she said. Maybe
she hadn’t had Bartonella, but she’d had spirochetes in her nervous
system, they’d affected her neurologically, and she hadn’t acted like I
was now; her throat caught. The real me felt ashamed and said, “You’re
right, I’m so sorry,” but Bartonella heard her say, “Bartonella,” and
awakened. Bartonella me yelled, “You want to know why? Because I’m
pissed at you, bitch!” and she gasped and asked how dare I call her
that? And added that, truthfully, she was angry at me, too; I heard
branches rustle and, distantly, someone call, “Who’s there?” but, out of
my head, I said, “Bring it on, bitch! Here’s my chin!” I saw my sister
frown and rear back. Then an immense fist like a sledgehammer punched my
jaw.</p>
<p>I fell on my butt on the trail. An orange pain was my jaw and also
the world. I had three faces and saw three sisters. It wasn’t she who’d
hit me—it was the orangutan. Rather, the secretary, Kunda’s husband; I
heard him say, “I’ve never punched anyone before, I was just so mad
about what she said to Kunda,” and my sister muttered, “Done is done,”
and the willowy black shadow of one of my brothers said, “She sort of…”
and the other’s said, “Deserved it,” and the secretary touched my face
and said, “No worries, it’s not dislocated”; the others showed up, my
nieces asked what happened, my sister’s mouth opened and closed, as did
the secretary’s, and I said, “I fell and hit my jaw on a stone.” My
sister announced that we weren’t finding Crow tonight and should go
home. My nieces protested that we couldn’t leave Crow, so my sister told
them that she was probably hiding in a safe place in the forest, just
waiting for daylight to come home.</p>
<p>Adira begged us to leave the sliding door open for the cat. My sister
didn’t want to wake up to raccoons in the kitchen, but my niece
insisted. So my sister—who couldn’t deny her daughters anything—said
O.K.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The weird thing about blood-sugar issues is that they don’t go away
just because you’ve had a bad Christmas. I woke up at 3 a.m. The house
was quiet. I guessed everyone was asleep. I figured I could sneak into
the kitchen and eat half a pecan pie and no one would know. I entered
the kitchen and found half a pecan pie, covered in foil, on the counter.
I unwrapped it. I already tasted it in my mouth, even before eating it;
that’s the horrible thing. Stale pecans, wheat crust, lard, and corn
syrup—I was desperate for it. Outside, it was coal-black. Cold wind blew
through the open door. I stuck my finger in the pie and scooped out a
big blob. The pecan-syrup blob was moving toward my mouth when I heard a
high-pitched cry, outside in the yard. I felt afraid. I put the blob
back in the pie tin, and stepped away; a black ball shot into the
kitchen, moving toward me fast, uttering a high sound, once-cat, but it
moved on its belly, pulled itself forward by using its front paws, which
scraped madly, nails clicking, across the floor; it had no legs, only a
head and a torso, it seemed to roll past me, it paused between the
circle room and the kitchen and looked at me. It was Crow, but her back
legs seemed to have disappeared—she was half a cat and her face looked
gigantic, puffed to twice its size. I’ve never been so terrified of
anything in my life, and nothing else has ever made me so sad as hearing
that pitiful cry and seeing the cat with no hindquarters.</p>
<p>My sister appeared in the hall. “God,” she said. “We have to get it
out of here. I don’t want the girls to see it, it will upset them—”</p>
<p>My elder niece appeared. She said simply, “The coyote ate her legs,”
and walked toward her cat, and my sister yelled, “Don’t touch her! She’s
hurt, she may bite you,” but the kid knelt by the cat and pressed her
hand along its back; it didn’t move, and my sister rushed forward to
pull my niece away, but as soon as she neared the animal it opened its
mouth, its enormous swollen face twitched, and it released two
gelatinous orbs.</p>
<p>Once they came out, the cat’s face became normal-sized. The whitish
blobs slid across the floor—golf-ball size, like undercooked eggs with
red tendrils. In one I could see the golden disk and the dark pupil.</p>
<p>My sister said, “What are those? Ugh!”</p>
<p>My niece said, “She got them.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Revelstoke is an unusual town. The veterinary clinic’s reception
contains Oriental rugs and damask couches, and the clinic stays open all
night, even on Christmas. We took the cat in and they operated
immediately, saving one hind leg, which had been folded behind her; the
technicians weren’t certain, but they said that the thighs appeared
serrated by coyote’s teeth, and all seven of them—there were seven
technicians—said they’d never seen a cat get away from a coyote, and
that it was a miracle that she was alive. We left the clinic at 6 a.m.,
the pet’s remaining leg in a cast, and I’m sure you saw this coming, K,
but the sky had grayed over, and, as we left the clinic and saw the firs
on the distant mountains, down came white flakes, huge, far apart, as
large as in picture books, the first of the year, and they fell onto our
tongues, as if the earth were saying, “Jesus is Lord,” or else, “Here is
some snow,” or just, “Global warming hasn’t killed me yet, I’m
alive.”</p>
<p>A somewhat odd thing happened that morning. My sister, who stuck up
for me when she was a kid, but whom no one stuck up for—ever, in any
way—thanked our mother and uncle for coming, and told our uncle that he
had to go.</p>
<p>Some say that those born between December 22nd and January 19th carry
existential sadness within them. They say that Capricorns are at the end
of their line; everything they want to do, they have to do within this
life. Perhaps that’s why they’re stubborn plodders who’ll trek step by
tiny step to reach their goals. I’m a hundred per cent sure that, as a
Russian Communist, K, you’ll say that that’s bunk, and that I should
never mention astrology in a story again. For what it’s worth, I write
to you as one child of winter to another.</p>
