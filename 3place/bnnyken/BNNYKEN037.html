<h4 id="bullet-in-the-brain">Bullet in the Brain</h4>
<p>By Tobias Wolff (1995)</p>
<p>The line was endless. Anders couldn’t get to the bank until just
before it closed and now he was stuck behind two women whose loud,
stupid conversation put him in a murderous temper. He was never in the
best of tempers anyway, Anders—a book critic known for the weary,
elegant savagery with which he dispatched almost everything he
reviewed.</p>
<p>With the line still doubled around the rope, one of the tellers stuck
a Position Closed sign in her window and walked to the back of the bank,
where she leaned against a desk and began to pass the time with a man
shuffling papers. The women in front of Anders broke off their
conversation and watched the teller with hatred. “Oh, that’s nice,” one
of them said. She turned to Anders and added, confident of his accord,
“One of those little human touches that keep us coming back.”</p>
<p>Anders had conceived his own towering hatred of the teller, but he
immediately turned it on the presumptuous crybaby in front of him.
“Damned unfair,” he said. “Tragic, really. If they’re not chopping off
the wrong leg, or bombing your ancestral village, they’re closing their
positions.”</p>
<p>She stood her ground. “I didn’t say it was tragic,” she said. “I just
think it’s a pretty lousy way to treat your customers.”</p>
<p>“Unforgivable,” Anders said. “Heaven will take note.”</p>
<p>She sucked in her cheeks but stared past him and said nothing. Anders
saw that the other woman, her friend, was looking in the same direction.
And then the tellers stopped what they were doing, and the customers
slowly turned, and silence came over the bank. Two men wearing black ski
masks and blue business suits were standing to the side of the door. One
of them had a pistol pressed against the guard’s neck. The guard’s eyes
were closed, and his lips were moving. The other man had a sawed-off
shotgun. “Keep your big mouth shut!” the man with the pistol said,
though no one had spoken a word. “One of you tellers hits the alarm,
you’re all dead meat. Got it?”</p>
<p>The tellers nodded.</p>
<p>“Oh, bravo,” Anders said. “Dead meat.” He turned to the woman in
front of him. “Great script, eh? The stern, brass-knuckled poetry of the
dangerous classes.”</p>
<p>She looked at him with drowning eyes.</p>
<p>The man with the shotgun pushed the guard to his knees. He handed the
shotgun to his partner and yanked the guard’s wrists up behind his back
and locked them together with a pair of handcuffs. He then toppled him
onto the floor with a kick between the shoulder blades. He took his
shotgun back and went over to the security gate at the end of the
counter. He was short and heavy and moved with peculiar slowness, even
torpor. “Buzz him in,” his partner said. The man with the shotgun
sauntered along the line of tellers, handing each of them a Hefty bag.
When he came to the empty position he looked over at the man with the
pistol, who said, “Whose slot is that?”</p>
<p>Anders watched the teller. She put her hand to her throat and turned
to the man she’d been talking to. He nodded. “Mine,” she said.</p>
<p>“Then get your ugly ass in gear and fill that bag.”</p>
<p>“There you go,” Anders said to the woman in front of him. “Justice is
done.”</p>
<p>“Hey! Bright boy! Did I tell you to talk?”</p>
<p>“No,” Anders said.</p>
<p>“Then shut your trap.”</p>
<p>“Did you hear that?” Anders said. “ ‘Bright boy.’ Right out of ‘The
Killers.’ ”</p>
<p>“Please be quiet,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“Hey, you deaf or what?” The man with the pistol walked over to
Anders. He poked the weapon into Anders’ gut. “You think I’m playing
games?”</p>
<p>“No,” Anders said, but the barrel tickled like a stiff finger and he
had to fight back the titters. He did this by making himself stare into
the man’s eyes, which were clearly visible behind the holes in the mask:
pale-blue and rawly red-rimmed. The man’s left eyelid kept twitching. He
breathed out a piercing, ammoniac smell that shocked Anders more than
anything that had happened, and he was beginning to develop a sense of
unease when the man prodded him again with the pistol.</p>
<p>“You like me, bright boy?” he said. “You want to suck my dick?”</p>
<p>“No,” Anders said.</p>
<p>“Then stop looking at me.”</p>
<p>Anders fixed his gaze on the man’s shiny wing-tip shoes.</p>
<p>“Not down there. Up there.” He stuck the pistol under Anders’ chin
and pushed it upward until Anders was looking at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Anders had never paid much attention to that part of the bank, a
pompous old building with marble floors and counters and pillars and
gilt scrollwork over the tellers’ cages. The domed ceiling had been
decorated with mythological figures whose fleshy, toga-draped ugliness
Anders had taken in at a glance many years earlier and afterward
declined to notice. Now he had no choice but to scrutinize the painter’s
work. It was worse than he remembered, and all of it executed with the
utmost gravity. The artist had a few tricks up his sleeve and used them
again and again—a certain rosy blush on the underside of the clouds, a
coy backward glance on the faces of the cupids and fauns. The ceiling
was crowded with various dramas, but the one that caught Anders’ eye was
Zeus and Europa—portrayed, in this rendition, as a bull ogling a cow
from behind a haystack. To make the cow sexy, the painter had canted her
hips suggestively and given her long, droopy eyelashes, through which
she gazed back at the bull with sultry welcome. The bull wore a smirk
and his eyebrows were arched. If there’d been a bubble coming out of his
mouth, it would have said, “Hubba hubba.”</p>
<p>“What’s so funny, bright boy?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“You think I’m comical? You think I’m some kind of clown?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You think you can fuck with me?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Fuck with me again, you’re history. Capeesh?”</p>
<p>Anders burst out laughing. He covered his mouth with both hands and
said, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” then snorted helplessly through his
fingers and said, “Capeesh, oh, God, capeesh,” and at that the man with
the pistol raised the pistol and shot Anders right in the head.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The bullet smashed Anders’ skull and plowed through his brain and
exited behind his right ear, scattering shards of bone into the cerebral
cortex, the corpus callosum, back toward the basal ganglia, and down
into the thalamus. But before all this occurred, the first appearance of
the bullet in the cerebrum set off a crackling chain of ion transports
and neurotransmissions. Because of their peculiar origin, these traced a
peculiar pattern, flukishly calling to life a summer afternoon some
forty years past, and long since lost to memory. After striking the
cranium, the bullet was moving at nine hundred feet per second, a
pathetically sluggish, glacial pace compared with the synaptic lightning
that flashed around it. Once in the brain, that is, the bullet came
under the mediation of brain time, which gave Anders plenty of leisure
to contemplate the scene that, in a phrase he would have abhorred,
“passed before his eyes.”</p>
<p>It is worth noting what Anders did not remember, given what he did
remember. He did not remember his first lover, Sherry, or what he had
most madly loved about her, before it came to irritate him—her
unembarrassed carnality, and especially the cordial way she had with his
unit, which she called Mr. Mole, as in “Uh-oh, looks like Mr. Mole wants
to play,” and “Let’s hide Mr. Mole!” Anders did not remember his wife,
whom he had also loved, before she exhausted him with her
predictability, or his daughter, now a sullen professor of economics at
Dartmouth. He did not remember standing just outside his daughter’s door
as she lectured her bear about his naughtiness and described the truly
appalling punishments Paws would receive unless he changed his ways. He
did not remember a single line of the hundreds of poems he had committed
to memory in his youth so that he could give himself the shivers at
will—not “Silent, upon a peak in Darien,” or “My God, I heard this day,”
or “All my pretty ones? Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?” None of
these did he remember; not one. Anders did not remember his dying mother
saying of his father, “I should have stabbed him in his sleep.”</p>
<p>He did not remember Professor Josephs telling his class how the
Spartans had released Athenian prisoners from their mines if they could
recite Aeschylus, and then reciting Aeschylus himself, right there, in
the Greek. Anders did not remember how his eyes had burned at those
sounds. He did not remember the surprise of seeing a college classmate’s
name on the jacket of a novel not long after they graduated, or the
respect he had felt after reading the book. He did not remember the
pleasure of giving respect.</p>
<p>Nor did Anders remember seeing a woman leap to her death from the
building opposite his own, just days after his daughter was born. He did
not remember shouting, “Lord have mercy!” He did not remember
deliberately crashing his father’s car into a tree, or having his ribs
kicked in by three policemen at an antiwar rally, or waking himself up
with laughter. He did not remember when he began to regard the heap of
books on his desk with boredom and dread, or when he grew angry at
writers for writing them. He did not remember when everything began to
remind him of something else.</p>
<p>This is what he remembered. Heat. A baseball field. Yellow grass, the
whirr of insects, himself leaning against a tree as the boys of the
neighborhood gather for a pickup game. The captains, precociously large
boys named Burns and Darsch, argue the relative genius of Mantle and
Mays. They have been worrying this subject all summer, and it has become
tedious to Anders; an oppression, like the heat.</p>
<p>Then the last two boys arrive, Coyle and a cousin of his from
Mississippi. Anders has never met Coyle’s cousin before and will never
see him again. He says hi with the rest but takes no further notice of
him until they’ve chosen sides and Darsch asks the cousin what position
he wants to play. “Shortstop,” the boy says. “Short’s the best position
they is.” Anders turns and looks at him. He wants to hear Coyle’s cousin
repeat what he’s just said, but he knows better than to ask. The others
will think he’s being a jerk, ragging the kid for his grammar. But that
isn’t it, not at all—it’s that Anders is strangely roused, elated, by
those final two words, their pure unexpectedness and their music. He
takes the field in a trance, repeating them to himself.</p>
<p>The bullet is already in the brain; it won’t be outrun forever, or
charmed to a halt. In the end, it will do its work and leave the
troubled skull behind, dragging its comet’s tail of memory and hope and
talent and love into the marble hall of commerce. That can’t be helped.
But for now Anders can still make time. Time for the shadows to lengthen
on the grass, time for the tethered dog to bark at the flying ball, time
for the boy in right field to smack his sweat-blackened mitt and softly
chant, They is, they is, they is.</p>
