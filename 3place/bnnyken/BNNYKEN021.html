<h4 id="the-house-of-the-famous-poet">The House of the Famous Poet</h4>
<p>By Muriel Spark (1966)</p>
<p>In the summer of 1944, when it was nothing for trains from the
provinces to be five or six hours late, I travelled to London on the
night train from Edinburgh, which, at York, was already three hours
late. There were ten people in the compartment, only two of whom I
remember well, and for good reason.</p>
<p>I have the impression, looking back on it, of a row of people
opposite me, dozing untidily with heads askew, and, as it often seems
when we look at sleeping strangers, their features had assumed extra
emphasis and individuality, sometimes disturbing to watch. It was as if
they had rendered up their daytime talent for obliterating the outward
traces of themselves in exchange for mental obliteration. In this way,
they resembled a twelfth-century fresco; there was a look of medieval
unself-consciousness about these people, all except one.</p>
<p>This was a private soldier, who was awake to a greater degree than
most people are when they are not sleeping. He was smoking cigarettes
one after the other with long, calm puffs. I thought he looked
excessively evil—an atavistic type. His forehead must have been less
than two inches high above dark, thick eyebrows, which met. His jaw was
not large, but it was apelike; so was his small nose and so were his
deep, close-set eyes. I thought there must have been some consanguinity
in the parents. He was quite a throwback.</p>
<p>As it turned out, he was extremely gentle and kind. When I ran out of
cigarettes, he fished about in his haversack and produced a packet for
me and one for a girl sitting next me. We both tried, with a flutter of
small change, to pay him. Nothing would please him at all but that we
should accept his cigarettes, whereupon he returned to his silent,
reflective smoking.</p>
<p>I felt a sort of pity for him then, rather as we feel toward animals
we know to be harmless, such as monkeys. But I realized that, like the
pity we expend on monkeys merely because they are not human beings, this
pity was not needed.</p>
<p>Receiving the cigarettes gave the girl and myself common ground, and
we conversed quietly for the rest of the journey. She told me she had a
job in London as a domestic helper and nursemaid. She looked as if she
had come from a country district—her very blond hair, red face, and
large bones gave the impression of power, as if she was used to carrying
heavy things, perhaps great scuttlesful of coal, or two children at a
time. But what made me curious about her was her voice, which was
cultivated, melodious, and restrained.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the journey, when the people were beginning to jerk
themselves straight and the rushing to and fro in the corridor had
started, this girl, Elise, asked me to come with her to the house where
she worked. The master, who was something in a university, was away with
his wife and family.</p>
<p>I agreed to this, because at that time I was in the way of thinking
that the discovery of an educated servant girl was valuable and
something to be gone deeper into. It had the element of
experience—perhaps even of truth, and I believed, in those days, that
truth is stranger than fiction. Besides, I wanted to spend that Sunday
in London. I was due back the next day at my job in a branch of the
Civil Service which had been evacuated to the country, and, for a reason
that is another story, I didn’t want to return too soon. I had some
telephoning to do. I wanted to wash and change. I wanted to know more
about the girl. So I thanked Elise and accepted her invitation.</p>
<p>I regretted it as soon as we got out of the train at King’s Cross,
some minutes after ten. Standing up tall on the platform, Elise looked
unbearably tired, as if not only the last night’s journey but every
fragment of her unknown life was suddenly heaping up on top of her. The
power I had noticed in the train was no longer there. As she called, in
her beautiful voice, for a porter, I saw that on the side of her head
that had been away from me in the train her hair was parted in a dark
streak, which, by contrast with the yellow, looked navy blue. I had
thought, when I first saw her, that possibly her hair was bleached, but
now, seeing it so badly done, seeing this navy-blue parting pointing
like an arrow to the weighted weariness of her face, I, too, got the
sensation of great tiredness. And it was not only the strain of the
journey that I felt but the foreknowledge of boredom that comes upon us
unaccountably at the beginning of a quest, and that checks, perhaps
mercifully, our curiosity.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>And, as it happened, there really wasn’t much to learn about Elise.
The explanation of her that I had been prompted to seek I got in the
taxi between King’s Cross and the house at Swiss Cottage. She came of a
good family, who thought her a pity, and she them. Having no training
for anything else, she had taken a domestic job on leaving home. She was
engaged to an Australian soldier billeted also at Swiss Cottage.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the anticipation of a day’s boredom, maybe it was the
effect of no sleep or the fact that the V-1 sirens were sounding, but I
felt some sourness when I saw the house. The garden was growing all over
the place. Elise opened the front door, and we entered a darkish room
almost wholly taken up with a long, plain wood worktable. On this were a
half-empty marmalade jar, a pile of papers, and a dried-up ink bottle.
There was a steel-canopied bed, known as a Morrison shelter, in one
corner and some photographs on the mantelpiece—one of a schoolboy
wearing glasses. Everything was tainted with Elise’s weariness and my
own distaste. But Elise didn’t seem to be aware of the exhaustion so
plainly revealed on her face. She did not even bother to take her coat
off, and as it was too tight for her, I wondered how she could move
about so quickly with this restriction added to the weight of her
tiredness. But, with her coat still buttoned tight, Elise phoned her boy
friend and made breakfast, while I washed in a dim blue cracked bathroom
upstairs.</p>
<p>When I found that she had opened my holdall without asking me and had
taken out my rations, I was a little pleased. It seemed a friendly
action, with some measure of reality about it, and I felt better. But I
was still irritated by the house. I felt there was no justification for
the positive lack of consequence, which was lying about here and there.
I asked no questions about the owner who was something in a university,
for fear of getting the answer I expected—that he was away visiting his
grandchildren, at some family gathering in the home counties. The owners
of the house had no reality for me, and I looked upon the place as
belonging to, and permeated with, Elise.</p>
<p>I went with her to a nearby public house, where she met her boy
friend and one or two other Australian soldiers, who had with them a
thin Cockney girl with bad teeth. Elise was very happy, and insisted in
her lovely voice that they should all come along to a party at the house
that evening. In a fine aristocratic tone, she demanded that each should
bring a bottle of beer.</p>
<p>During the afternoon, Elise said she was going to have a bath, and
she showed me a room where I could use the phone and sleep if I wanted.
This was a large, light room with several windows, much more orderly
than the rest of the house, and lined with books. There was only one
unusual thing about it: beside one of the windows was a bed, but this
bed was only a fairly thick mattress made up neatly on the floor. It was
obviously a bed on the floor with some purpose, and again I was angered
to think of the futile crankiness of the elderly professor who had
thought of it.</p>
<p>I did my telephoning, and decided to rest. But first I wanted to find
something to read. The books puzzled me. None of them seemed to be
automatically part of a scholar’s library. An inscription in one book
was signed by the author, a well-known novelist. I found another
inscribed copy, and this had the name of the recipient. On a sudden
idea, I went to the desk, where while I had been telephoning I had
noticed a pile of unopened letters. For the first time, I looked at the
name of the owner of the house.</p>
<p>I ran to the bathroom and shouted through the door to Elise, “Is this
the house of the famous poet?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she called. “I told you.”</p>
<p>She had told me nothing of the kind. I felt I had no right at all to
be there, for it wasn’t, now, the house of Elise acting by proxy for
some unknown couple. It was the house of a famous modern poet. The
thought that at any moment he and his family might walk in and find me
there terrified me. I insisted that Elise should open the bathroom door
and tell me to my face that there was no possible chance of their
returning for many days to come.</p>
<p>Then I began to think about the house itself, which Elise was no
longer accountable for. Its new definition, as the house of a poet whose
work I knew well, many of whose poems I knew by heart, gave it
altogether a fresh appearance.</p>
<p>To confirm this, I went outside and stood exactly where I had been
when I first saw the garden from the door of the taxi. I wanted to get
my first impression for a second time. And this time I saw an absolute
purpose in the overgrown garden, which, since then, I have come to
believe existed in the eye of the beholder. But, at the time, the room
we had first entered, and which had riled me, now began to give back a
meaning, and whatever was was right. The caked-up bottle of ink, which
Elise had put on the mantelpiece, I replaced on the table to make sure.
I saw a photograph I hadn’t noticed before, and I recognized the famous
poet.</p>
<p>It was the same with the upstairs room where Elise had put me, and I
handled the books again, not so much with the sense that they belonged
to the famous poet but with some curiosity about how they had been made.
The sort of question that occurred to me was where the paper had come
from and from what sort of vegetation was manufactured the black print,
and these things have not troubled me since.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The Australians and the Cockney girl came around about seven. I had
planned to catch an eight-thirty train to the country, but when I
telephoned to confirm the time I found there were no Sunday trains
running. Elise, in her friendly and exhausted way, begged me to stay
without attempting to be too serious about it. The sirens were starting
up again. I asked Elise once more to repeat that the poet and his family
could by no means return that night. But I asked this question more
abstractedly than before, as I was thinking of the sirens and of the
exact proportions of the noise they made. I wondered, as well, what
sinister genius of the Home Office could have invented so ominous a
wail, and why. And I was thinking of the word “siren.” The sound then
became comical, for I imagined some maniac sea nymph from centuries past
belching into the year 1944. Actually, the sirens frightened me.</p>
<p>Most of all, I wondered about Elise’s party. Everyone roamed about
the place as if it were nobody’s house in particular, with Elise the
best-behaved of the lot. The Cockney girl sat on the long table and gave
of her best to the skies every time a bomb exploded. I had the feeling
that the house had been requisitioned for an evening by the military. It
was so hugely and everywhere occupied that it became not the house I had
first entered, nor the house of the famous poet, but a third house—the
one I had vaguely prefigured when I stood, bored, on the platform at
King’s Cross station. I saw a great amount of tiredness among these
people, and heard, from the loud noise they made, that they were all
lacking sleep. When the beer was finished and they were gone, some to
their billets, some to pubs, and the Cockney girl to her Underground
shelter where she had slept for weeks past, I asked Elise, “Don’t you
feel tired?”</p>
<p>“No,” she said with agonizing weariness, “I never feel tired.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>I fell asleep myself, as soon as I had got into the bed on the floor
in the upstairs room, and overslept until Elise woke me at eight. I had
wanted to get up early to catch a nine-o’clock train, so I hadn’t much
time to speak to her. I did notice, though, that she had lost some of
her tired look.</p>
<p>I was pushing my things into my holdall while Elise went up the
street to catch a taxi when I heard someone coming upstairs. I thought
it was Elise come back, and I looked out of the open door. I saw a man
in uniform carrying an enormous parcel in both hands. He looked down as
he climbed, and had a cigarette in his mouth.</p>
<p>“Do you want Elise?” I called, thinking it was one of her
friends.</p>
<p>He looked up, and I recognized the soldier, the throwback, who had
given us cigarettes in the train.</p>
<p>“Well, anyone will do,” he said. “The thing is, I’ve got to get back
to camp and I’m stuck for the fare—eight and sixpence.”</p>
<p>I told him I could manage it, and was finding the money when he said,
putting his parcel on the floor, “I don’t want to borrow it. I wouldn’t
think of borrowing it. I’ve got something for sale.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” I said.</p>
<p>“A funeral,” said the soldier. “I’ve got it here.”</p>
<p>This alarmed me, and I went to the window. No hearse, no coffin stood
below. I saw only the avenue of trees.</p>
<p>The soldier smiled, “It’s an abstract funeral,” he explained, opening
the parcel.</p>
<p>He took it out and I examined it carefully, greatly comforted. It was
very much the sort of thing I had wanted—rather more purple in parts
than I would have liked, for I was not in favor of this color of
mourning. Still, I thought I could tone it down a bit.</p>
<p>Delighted with the bargain, I handed over the eight shillings and
sixpence. There was a great deal of this abstract funeral. Hastily, I
packed some of it into the holdall. Some I stuffed in my pockets, and
there was still some left over. Elise had returned with a cab and I
hadn’t much time. So I ran for it, out of the door and out of the gate
of the house of the famous poet, with the rest of my funeral trailing
behind me.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>You will complain that I am withholding evidence. Indeed, you may
wonder if there is any evidence at all. “An abstract funeral,” you will
say, “is neither here nor there. It is only a notion. You cannot pack a
notion into your bag. You cannot see the color of a notion.”</p>
<p>You will insinuate that what I have just told you is pure
fiction.</p>
<p>Hear me to the end.</p>
<p>I caught the train. Imagine my surprise when I found sitting opposite
me my friend the soldier, of whose existence you are so skeptical.</p>
<p>“As a matter of interest,” I said, “how would you describe all this
funeral you sold me?”</p>
<p>“Describe it?” he said. “Nobody describes an abstract funeral. You
just conceive it.”</p>
<p>“There is much in what you say,” I replied. “Still, describe it I
must, because it is not every day one comes by an abstract funeral.”</p>
<p>“I am glad you appreciate that,” said the soldier.</p>
<p>“And after the war,” I continued, “when I am no longer a civil
servant, I hope, in a few deftly turned phrases, to write of my
experiences at the house of the famous poet, which have culminated like
this. But, of course,” I added, “I will need to say what it looks
like.”</p>
<p>The soldier did not reply.</p>
<p>“If it were an okapi or a sea cow,” I said, “I would have to say what
it looked like. No one would believe me otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Do you want your money back?” asked the soldier. “Because if so, you
can’t have it. I spent it on my ticket.”</p>
<p>“Don’t misunderstand me,” I hastened to say. “The funeral is a
delightful abstraction. Only I wish to put it down in writing.”</p>
<p>I felt a great pity for the soldier on seeing his worried look. The
apelike head seemed the saddest thing in the world.</p>
<p>“I make them by hand,” he said,”these abstract funerals.”</p>
<p>A siren sounded somewhere, far away.</p>
<p>“Elise bought one of them last month. She hadn’t any complaints. I
change at the next stop,” he said, getting down his kit from the rack.
“And what’s more,” he said, “your famous poet bought one.”</p>
<p>“Oh, did he?” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said. “No complaints. It was just what he wanted—the idea
of a funeral.”</p>
<p>The train pulled up. The soldier leaped down and waved. As the train
started again, I unpacked my abstract funeral and looked at it for a few
moments.</p>
<p>“To hell with the idea,” I said. “It’s a real funeral I want.”</p>
<p>“All in good time,” said a voice from the corridor.</p>
<p>“You again,” I said. It was the soldier.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, “I got off at the last station. I’m only a notion of
myself.”</p>
<p>“Look here,” I said, “would you be offended if I throw all this
away?”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” said the soldier. “You can’t offend a notion.”</p>
<p>“I want a real funeral,” I explained. “One of my own.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said the soldier.</p>
<p>“And then I’ll be able to write about it and go into all the
details,” I said.</p>
<p>“Your own funeral?” he said. “You want to write it up?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“But,” said he, “you’re only human. Nobody reports on their own
funeral. It’s got to be abstract.”</p>
<p>“You see my predicament?” I said.</p>
<p>“I see it,” he replied. “I get off at this stop.”</p>
<p>This notion of a soldier alighted. Once more the train put on speed.
Out of the window I chucked all my eight-and-sixpence worth of abstract
funeral. I watched it fluttering over the fields and around the tops of
camouflaged factories with sun glittering richly upon it, until it was
out of sight.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>In the summer of 1944, a great many people were harshly and suddenly
killed. The papers reported, in due course, those whose names were known
to the public. One of those, the famous poet, had returned unexpectedly
to his home at Swiss Cottage a few moments before it was hit direct by a
flying bomb. Fortunately, he had left his wife and children in the
country.</p>
<p>When I got to the place where my job was, I had some time to spare
before going on duty. I decided to ring Elise and thank her properly, as
I had left in such a hurry. But the lines were out of order, and the
operator could not find words enough to express her annoyance with me.
Behind this overworked, quarrelsome voice from the exchange I heard the
high, long hoot that means that the telephone at the other end is not
functioning, and the sound made me infinitely depressed and weary; it
was more intolerable to me than the sirens, and I replaced the receiver;
and, in fact, Elise had already perished under the house of the famous
poet.</p>
<p>The blue cracked bathroom, the bed on the floor, the caked ink
bottle, the neglected garden, and the neat rows of books—I try to gather
them together in my mind whenever I am enraged by the thought that Elise
and the poet were killed outright. The angels of the Resurrection will
invoke the dead man and the dead woman, but who will care to restore the
fallen house of the famous poet if not myself? Who else will tell its
story?</p>
<p>When I reflect how Elise and the poet were taken in—how they calmly
allowed a well-meaning soldier to sell them the notion of a funeral—I
remind myself that one day I will accept, and so will you, an abstract
funeral, and make no complaints.</p>
