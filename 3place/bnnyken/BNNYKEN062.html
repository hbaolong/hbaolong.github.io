<h4 id="tenth-of-december">Tenth of December</h4>
<p>By George Saunders (2011)</p>
<p>The pale boy with unfortunate Prince Valiant bangs and cublike
mannerisms hulked to the mudroom closet and requisitioned Dad’s white
coat. Then requisitioned the boots he’d spray-painted white. Painting
the pellet gun white had been a no. That was a gift from Aunt Chloe.
Every time she came over he had to haul it out so she could make a big
stink about the woodgrain.</p>
<p>Today’s assignation: walk to pond, ascertain beaver dam. Likely he
would be detained. By that species that lived amongst the old rock wall.
They were small but, upon emerging, assumed certain proportions. And
gave chase. This was just their methodology. His aplomb threw them
loops. He knew that. And revelled it. He would turn, level the pellet
gun, intone: Are you aware of the usage of this human implement?</p>
<p>Blam!</p>
<p>They were Netherworlders. Or Nethers. They had a strange bond with
him. Sometimes for whole days he would just nurse their wounds.
Occasionally, for a joke, he would shoot one in the butt as it fled. Who
henceforth would limp for the rest of its days. Which could be as long
as an additional nine million years.</p>
<p>Safe inside the rock wall, the shot one would go, Guys, look at my
butt.</p>
<p>As a group, all would look at Gzeemon’s butt, exchanging sullen
glances of: Gzeemon shall indeed be limping for the next nine million
years, poor bloke.</p>
<p>Because yes: Nethers tended to talk like that guy in “Mary
Poppins.”</p>
<p>Which naturally raised some mysteries as to their origin here on
Earth.</p>
<p>Detaining him was problematic for the Nethers. He was wily. Plus
could not fit through their rock-wall opening. When they tied him up and
went inside to brew their special miniaturizing potion—Wham!—he would
snap their antiquated rope with a move from his self-invented
martial-arts system, Toi Foi, a.k.a. Deadly Forearms. And place at their
doorway an implacable rock of suffocation, trapping them inside.</p>
<p>Later, imagining them in their death throes, taking pity on them, he
would come back, move the rock.</p>
<p>Blimey, one of them might say from withal. Thanks, guv’nor. You are
indeed a worthy adversary.</p>
<p>Sometimes there would be torture. They would make him lie on his back
looking up at the racing clouds while they tortured him in ways he could
actually take. They tended to leave his teeth alone. Which was lucky. He
didn’t even like to get a cleaning. They were dunderheads in that
manner. They never messed with his peen and never messed with his
fingernails. He’d just abide there, infuriating them with his snow
angels. Sometimes, believing it their coup de grâce, not realizing he’d
heard this since time in memorial from certain in-school cretins, they’d
go, Wow, we didn’t even know Robin could be a boy’s name. And chortle
their Nether laughs.</p>
<p>Today he had a feeling that the Nethers might kidnap Suzanne Bledsoe,
the new girl in homeroom. She was from Montreal. He just loved the way
she talked. So, apparently, did the Nethers, who planned to use her to
repopulate their depleted numbers and bake various things they did not
know how to bake.</p>
<p>All suited up now, NASA. Turning awkwardly to go out door.</p>
<p>Affirmative. We have your coördinates. Be careful out there,
Robin.</p>
<p>Whoa, cold, dang.</p>
<p>Duck thermometer read ten. And that was without windchill. That made
it fun. That made it real. A green Nissan was parked where Poole
dead-ended into the soccer field. Hopefully the owner was not some perv
he would have to outwit.</p>
<p>Or a Nether in the human guise.</p>
<p>Bright, bright blue and cold. Crunch went the snow as he crossed the
soccer field. Why did cold such as this give a running guy a headache?
Likely it was due to Prominent Windspeed Velocity.</p>
<p>The path into the woods was as wide as one human. It seemed the
Nether had indeed kidnapped Suzanne Bledsoe. Damn him! And his ilk.
Judging by the single set of tracks, the Nether appeared to be carrying
her. Foul cad. He’d better not be touching Suzanne inappropriately while
carrying her. If so, Suzanne would no doubt be resisting with untamable
fury.</p>
<p>This was concerning, this was very concerning.</p>
<p>When he caught up to them, he would say, Look, Suzanne, I know you
don’t know my name, having misaddressed me as Roger that time you asked
me to scoot over, but nevertheless I must confess I feel there is
something to us. Do you feel the same?</p>
<p>Suzanne had the most amazing brown eyes. They were wet now, with fear
and sudden reality.</p>
<p>Stop talking to her, mate, the Nether said.</p>
<p>I won’t, he said. And, Suzanne? Even if you don’t feel there is
something to us, rest assured I will still slay this fellow and return
you home. Where do you live again? Over in El Cirro? By the water tower?
Those are some nice houses back there.</p>
<p>Yes, Suzanne said. We also have a pool. You should come over next
summer. It’s cool if you swim with your shirt on. And also, yes to there
being something to us. You are by far the most insightful boy in our
class. Even when I take into consideration the boys I knew in Montreal,
I am just like: no one can compare.</p>
<p>Well, that’s nice to hear, he said. Thank you for saying that. I know
I’m not the thinnest.</p>
<p>The thing about girls? Suzanne said. Is we are more
content-driven.</p>
<p>Will you two stop already? the Nether said. Because now is the time
for your death. Deaths.</p>
<p>Well, now is certainly the time for somebody’s death, Robin said.</p>
<p>The twerpy thing was you never really got to save anyone. Last summer
there’d been a dying raccoon out here. He’d thought of lugging it home
so Mom could call the vet. But up close it was too scary. Raccoons being
actually bigger than they appear in cartoons. And this one looked like a
potential biter. So he ran home to get it some water at least. Upon his
return, he saw where the raccoon had done some apparent last-minute
thrashing. That was sad. He didn’t do well with sad. There had perchance
been some pre-weeping, by him, in the woods.</p>
<p>That just means you have a big heart, Suzanne said.</p>
<p>Well, I don’t know, he said modestly.</p>
<p>Here was the old truck tire. Where the high-school kids partied.
Inside the tire, frosted with snow, were three beer cans and a wadded-up
blanket.</p>
<p>You probably like to party, the Nether had cracked to Suzanne moments
earlier as they passed this very spot.</p>
<p>No, I don’t, Suzanne said. I like to play. And I like to hug.</p>
<p>Hoo boy, the Nether said. Sounds like Dullsville.</p>
<p>Somewhere there is a man who likes to play and hug, Suzanne said.</p>
<p>He came out of the woods now to the prettiest vista he knew. The pond
was a pure frozen white. It struck him as somewhat Switzerlandish.
Someday he would know for sure. When the Swiss threw him a parade or
whatnot.</p>
<p>Here the Nether’s tracks departed from the path, as if he had
contemplatively taken a moment to gaze at the pond. Perhaps this Nether
was not all bad. Perhaps he was having a debilitating conscience attack
vis-à-vis the valiantly struggling Suzanne atop his back. At least he
seemed to somewhat love nature.</p>
<p>Then the tracks returned to the path, wound around the pond, and
headed up Lexow Hill.</p>
<p>What was this strange object? A coat? On the bench? The bench the
Nethers used for their human sacrifices?</p>
<p>No accumulated snow on coat. Inside of coat still slightly warm.</p>
<p>Ergo: the recently discarded coat of the Nether.</p>
<p>This was some strange juju. This was an intriguing conundrum, if he
had ever encountered one. Which he had. Once, he’d found a bra on the
handlebars of a bike. Once, he’d found an entire untouched steak dinner
on a plate behind Fresno’s. And hadn’t eaten it. Though it had looked
pretty good.</p>
<p>Something was afoot.</p>
<p>Then he beheld, halfway up Lexow Hill, a man.</p>
<p>Coatless, bald-headed man. Super skinny. In what looked like pajamas.
Climbing plodfully, with tortoise patience, bare white arms sticking out
of his p.j. shirt like two bare white branches sticking out of a p.j.
shirt. Or grave.</p>
<p>What kind of person leaves his coat behind on a day like this? The
mental kind, that was who. This guy looked sort of mental. Like an
Auschwitz dude or sad confused grandpa.</p>
<p>Dad had once said, Trust your mind, Rob. If it smells like shit but
has writing across it that says Happy Birthday and a candle stuck down
in it, what is it?</p>
<p>Is there icing on it? he’d said.</p>
<p>Dad had done that thing of squinting his eyes when an answer was not
quite there yet.</p>
<p>What was his mind telling him now?</p>
<p>Something was wrong here. A person needed a coat. Even if the person
was a grownup. The pond was frozen. The duck thermometer said ten. If
the person was mental, all the more reason to come to his aid, as had
not Jesus said, Blessed are those who help those who cannot help
themselves, but are too mental, doddering, or have a disability?</p>
<p>He snagged the coat off the bench.</p>
<p>It was a rescue. A real rescue, at last, sort of.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Ten minutes earlier, Don Eber had paused at the pond to catch his
breath.</p>
<p>He was so tired. What a thing. Holy moly. When he used to walk
Sasquatch out here they’d do six times around the pond, jog up the hill,
tag the boulder on top, sprint back down.</p>
<p>Better get moving, said one of two guys who’d been in discussion in
his head all morning.</p>
<p>That is, if you’re still set on the boulder idea, the other said.</p>
<p>Which still strikes us as kind of fancy-pants.</p>
<p>Seemed like one guy was Dad and the other Kip Flemish.</p>
<p>Stupid cheaters. They’d switched spouses, abandoned the switched
spouses, fled together to California. Had they been gay? Or just
swingers? Gay swingers? The Dad and Kip in his head had acknowledged
their sins and the three of them had struck a deal: he would forgive
them for being possible gay swingers and leaving him to do Soap Box
Derby alone, with just Mom, and they would consent to giving him some
solid manly advice.</p>
<p>He wants it to be nice.</p>
<p>This was Dad now. It seemed Dad was somewhat on his side.</p>
<p>Nice? Kip said. That is not the word I would use.</p>
<p>A cardinal zinged across the day.</p>
<p>It was amazing. Amazing, really. He was young. He was fifty-three.
Now he’d never deliver his major national speech on compassion. What
about going down the Mississippi in a canoe? What about living in an
A-frame near a shady creek with the two hippie girls he’d met in 1968 in
that souvenir shop in the Ozarks, when Allen, his stepfather, wearing
those crazy aviators, had bought him a bag of fossil rocks? One of the
hippie girls had said that he, Eber, would be a fox when he grew up, and
would he please be sure to call her at that time? Then the hippie girls
had put their tawny heads together and giggled at his prospective
foxiness. And that had never—</p>
<p>That had somehow never—</p>
<p>Sister Val had said, Why not shoot for being the next J.F.K.? So he
had run for class president. Allen had bought him a Styrofoam straw
boater. They’d sat together, decorating the hatband with Magic Markers.
Win with Eber! On the back: Groovy! Allen had helped him record a tape.
Of a little speech. Allen had taken that tape somewhere and come back
with thirty copies, “to pass around.”</p>
<p>“Your message is good,” Allen had said. “And you are incredibly well
spoken. You can do this thing.”</p>
<p>And he’d done it. He’d won. Allen had thrown him a victory party. A
pizza party. All the kids had come.</p>
<p>Oh, Allen.</p>
<p>Kindest man ever. Had taken him swimming. Had taken him to découpage.
Had combed out his hair so patiently that time he came home with lice.
Never a harsh, etc., etc.</p>
<p>Not so once the suffering begat. Began. God damn it. More and more
his words. Askew. More and more his words were not what he would
hoped.</p>
<p>Hope.</p>
<p>Once the suffering began, Allen had raged. Said things no one should
say. To Mom, to Eber, to the guy delivering water. Went from a shy man,
always placing a reassuring hand on your back, to a diminished pale
figure in a bed, shouting Cunt!</p>
<p>Except with some weird New England accent, so it came out Kant!</p>
<p>The first time Allen had shouted Kant! there followed a funny moment
during which he and Mom looked at each other to see which of them was
being called Kant. But then Allen amended, for clarity: Kants!</p>
<p>So it was clear he meant both of them. What a relief.</p>
<p>They’d cracked up.</p>
<p>Jeez, how long had he been standing here? Daylight was waiting.</p>
<p>Wasting.</p>
<p>I honestly didn’t know what to do. But he made it so simple.</p>
<p>Took it all on himself.</p>
<p>So what else is new?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>This was Jodi and Tommy now.</p>
<p>Hi, kids.</p>
<p>Big day today.</p>
<p>I mean, sure, it would have been nice to have a chance to say a
proper goodbye.</p>
<p>But at what cost?</p>
<p>Exactly. And see—he knew that.</p>
<p>He was a father. That’s what a father does.</p>
<p>Eases the burdens of those he loves.</p>
<p>Saves the ones he loves from painful last images that might endure
for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Soon Allen had become that. And no one was going to fault anybody for
avoiding that. Sometimes he and Mom would huddle in the kitchen. Rather
than risk incurring the wrath of that. Even that understood the deal.
You’d trot in a glass of water, set it down, say, very politely,
Anything else, Allen? And you’d see that thinking, All these years I was
so good to you people and now I am merely that? Sometimes the gentle
Allen would be inside there, too, indicating, with his eyes, Look, go
away, please go away, I am trying so hard not to call you Kant!</p>
<p>Rail-thin, ribs sticking out.</p>
<p>Catheter taped to dick.</p>
<p>Waft of shit smell.</p>
<p>You are not Allen and Allen is not you.</p>
<p>So Molly had said.</p>
<p>As for Dr. Spivey, he couldn’t say. Wouldn’t say. Was busy drawing a
daisy on a Post-it. Then finally said, Well, honestly? As these things
grow, they can tend to do weird things. But it doesn’t necessarily have
to be terrible. Had one guy? Just always craved him a Sprite.</p>
<p>And Eber had thought, Did you, dear doctor/savior/lifeline, just say
craved him a Sprite?</p>
<p>That’s how they got you. You thought, Maybe I’ll just crave me a
Sprite. Next thing you knew, you were that, shouting Kant!, shitting
your bed, swatting at the people who were scrambling to clean you.</p>
<p>No, sir.</p>
<p>No sirree bob.</p>
<p>Wednesday he’d fallen out of the med-bed again. There on the floor in
the dark it had come to him: I could spare them.</p>
<p>Spare us? Or spare you?</p>
<p>Get thee behind me.</p>
<p>Get thee behind me, sweetie.</p>
<p>A breeze sent down a sequence of linear snow puffs from somewhere
above. Beautiful. Why were we made just so, to find so many things that
happened every day pretty?</p>
<p>He took off his coat.</p>
<p>Good Christ.</p>
<p>Took off his hat and gloves, stuffed the hat and gloves in a sleeve
of the coat, left the coat on the bench.</p>
<p>This way they’d know. They’d find the car, walk up the path, find the
coat.</p>
<p>It was a miracle. That he’d got this far. Well, he’d always been
strong. Once, he’d run a half-marathon with a broken foot. After his
vasectomy he’d cleaned the garage, no problem.</p>
<p>He’d waited in the med-bed for Molly to go off to the pharmacy. That
was the toughest part. Just calling out a normal goodbye.</p>
<p>His mind veered toward her now, and he jerked it back with a prayer:
Let me pull this off. Lord, let me not fuck it up. Let me bring no
dishonor. Leg me do it cling.</p>
<p>Let. Let me do it cling.</p>
<p>Clean.</p>
<p>Cleanly.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Estimated time of overtaking the Nether, handing him his coat?
Approximately nine minutes. Six minutes to follow the path around the
pond, an additional three minutes to fly up the hillside like a
delivering wraith or mercy-angel, bearing the simple gift of a coat.</p>
<p>That is just an estimate, NASA. I pretty much made that up.</p>
<p>We know that, Robin. We know very well by now how irreverent you
work.</p>
<p>Like that time you cut a fart on the moon.</p>
<p>Or the time you tricked Mel into saying, “Mr. President, what a
delightful surprise it was to find an asteroid circling Uranus.”</p>
<p>That estimate was particularly iffy. This Nether being surprisingly
brisk. Robin himself was not the fastest wicket in the stick. He had a
certain girth. Which Dad prognosticated would soon triumphantly congeal
into linebackerish solidity. He hoped so. For now he just had the slight
man-boobs.</p>
<p>Robin, hurry, Suzanne said. I feel so sorry for that poor old
guy.</p>
<p>He’s a fool, Robin said, because Suzanne was young, and did not yet
understand that when a man was a fool he made hardships for the other
men, who were less foolish than he.</p>
<p>He doesn’t have much time, Suzanne said, bordering on the
hysterical.</p>
<p>There, there, he said, comforting her.</p>
<p>I’m just so frightened, she said.</p>
<p>And yet he is fortunate to have one such as I to hump his coat up
that big-ass hill, which, due to its steepness, is not exactly my cup of
tea, Robin said.</p>
<p>I guess that’s the definition of “hero,” Suzanne said.</p>
<p>I guess so, he said.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to continue being insolent, she said. But he seems to be
pulling away.</p>
<p>What would you suggest? he said.</p>
<p>With all due respect, she said, and because I know you consider us as
equals but different, with me covering the brainy angle and special
inventions and whatnot?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, go ahead, he said.</p>
<p>Well, just working through the math in terms of simple geometry—</p>
<p>He saw where she was going with this. And she was quite right. No
wonder he loved her. He must cut across the pond, thereby decreasing the
ambient angle, ergo trimming valuable seconds off his catchup time.</p>
<p>Wait, Suzanne said. Is that dangerous?</p>
<p>It is not, he said. I have done it numerous times.</p>
<p>Please be careful, Suzanne implored.</p>
<p>Well, once, he said.</p>
<p>You have such aplomb, Suzanne demurred.</p>
<p>Actually never, he said softly, not wishing to alarm her.</p>
<p>Your bravery is irascible, Suzanne said.</p>
<p>He started across the pond.</p>
<p>It was actually pretty cool walking on water. In summer, canoes
floated here. If Mom could see him, she’d have a conniption. Mom treated
him like a piece of glass. Due to his alleged infant surgeries. She went
on full alert if he so much as used a stapler.</p>
<p>But Mom was a good egg. A reliable counsellor and steady hand of
guidance. She had a munificent splay of long silver hair and a raspy
voice, though she didn’t smoke and was even a vegan. She’d never been a
biker chick, although some of the in-school cretins claimed she
resembled one.</p>
<p>He was actually quite fond of Mom.</p>
<p>He was now approximately three-quarters, or that would be sixty per
cent, across.</p>
<p>Between him and the shore lay a grayish patch. Here in summer a
stream ran in. Looked a tad iffy. At the edge of the grayish patch he
gave the ice a bonk with the butt of his gun. Solid as anything.</p>
<p>Here he went. Ice rolled a bit underfoot. Probably it was shallow
here. Anyways he hoped so. Yikes.</p>
<p>How’s it going? Suzanne said, trepidly.</p>
<p>Could be better, he said.</p>
<p>Maybe you should turn back, Suzanne said.</p>
<p>But wasn’t this feeling of fear the exact feeling all heroes had to
confront early in life? Wasn’t overcoming this feeling of fear what
truly distinguished the brave?</p>
<p>There could be no turning back.</p>
<p>Or could there? Maybe there could. Actually there should.</p>
<p>The ice gave way and the boy fell through.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Nausea had not been mentioned in “The Humbling Steppe.”</p>
<p>A blissful feeling overtook me as I drifted off to sleep at the base
of the crevasse. No fear, no discomfort, only a vague sadness at the
thought of all that remained undone. This is death? I thought. It is but
nothing.</p>
<p>Author, whose name I cannot remember, I would like a word with
you.</p>
<p>A-hole.</p>
<p>The shivering was insane. Like a tremor. His head was shaking on his
neck. He paused to puke a bit in the snow, white-yellow against the
white-blue.</p>
<p>This was scary. This was scary now.</p>
<p>Every step was a victory. He had to remember that. With every step he
was fleeing father and father. Farther from father. Stepfarther. What a
victory he was wresting. From the jaws of the feet.</p>
<p>He felt a need at the back of his throat to say it right.</p>
<p>From the jaws of defeat. From the jaws of defeat.</p>
<p>Oh, Allen.</p>
<p>Even when you were that you were still Allen to me.</p>
<p>Please know that.</p>
<p>Falling, Dad said.</p>
<p>For some definite time he waited to see where he would land and how
much it would hurt. Then there was a tree in his gut. He found himself
wrapped fetally around some tree.</p>
<p>Fucksake.</p>
<p>Ouch, ouch. This was too much. He hadn’t cried after the surgeries or
during the chemo, but he felt like crying now. It wasn’t fair. It
happened to everyone supposedly but now it was happening specifically to
him. He’d kept waiting for some special dispensation. But no.
Something/someone bigger than him kept refusing. You were told the big
something/someone loved you especially but in the end you saw it was
otherwise. The big something/someone was neutral. Unconcerned. When it
innocently moved, it crushed people.</p>
<p>Years ago at “The Illuminated Body” he and Molly had seen this brain
slice. Marring the brain slice had been a nickel-size brown spot. That
brown spot was all it had taken to kill the guy. Guy must have had his
hopes and dreams, closet full of pants, and so on, some treasured
childhood memories: a mob of koi in the willow shade at Gage Park, say,
Gram searching in her Wrigley’s-smelling purse for a tissue—like that.
If not for that brown spot, the guy might have been one of the people
walking by on the way to lunch in the atrium. But no. He was defunct
now, off rotting somewhere, no brain in his head.</p>
<p>Looking down at the brain slice Eber had felt a sense of superiority.
Poor guy. It was pretty unlucky, what had happened to him.</p>
<p>He and Molly had fled to the atrium, had hot scones, watched a
squirrel mess with a plastic cup.</p>
<p>Wrapped fetally around the tree Eber traced the scar on his head.
Tried to sit. No dice. Tried to use the tree to sit up. His hand
wouldn’t close. Reaching around the tree with both hands, joining his
hands at the wrists, he sat himself up, leaned back against the
tree.</p>
<p>How was that?</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Good, actually.</p>
<p>Maybe this was it. Maybe this was as far as he got. He’d had it in
mind to sit cross-legged against the boulder at the top of the hill, but
really what difference did it make?</p>
<p>All he had to do now was stay put. Stay put by force-thinking the
same thoughts he’d used to propel himself out of the med-bed and into
the car and across the soccer field and through the woods:
MollyTommyJodi huddling in the kitchen filled with pity/loathing,
MollyTommyJodi recoiling at something cruel he’d said, Tommy hefting his
thin torso up in his arms so that MollyJodi could get under there with a
wash—</p>
<p>Then it would be done. He would have preëmpted all future debasement.
All his fears about the coming months would be mute.</p>
<p>Moot.</p>
<p>This was it. Was it? Not yet. Soon, though. An hour? Forty minutes?
Was he doing this? Really? He was. Was he? Would he be able to make it
back to the car even if he changed his mind? He thought not. Here he
was. He was here. This incredible opportunity to end things with dignity
was right in his hands.</p>
<p>All he had to do was stay put.</p>
<p>I will fight no more forever.</p>
<p>Concentrate on the beauty of the pond, the beauty of the woods, the
beauty you are returning to, the beauty that is everywhere as far as you
can—</p>
<p>Oh, for shitsake.</p>
<p>Oh, for crying out loud.</p>
<p>Some kid was on the pond.</p>
<p>Chubby kid in white. With a gun. Carrying Eber’s coat.</p>
<p>You little fart, put that coat down, get your ass home, mind your
own—</p>
<p>Damn. Damn it.</p>
<p>Kid tapped the ice with the butt of his gun.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t want some kid finding you. That could scar a kid.
Although kids found freaky things all the time. Once, he’d found a naked
photo of Dad and Mrs. Flemish. That had been freaky. Of course, not as
freaky as a grimacing cross-legged—</p>
<p>Kid was swimming.</p>
<p>Swimming was not allowed. That was clearly posted. No Swimming.</p>
<p>Kid was a bad swimmer. Real thrashfest down there. Kid was creating
with his thrashing a rapidly expanding black pool. With each thrash the
kid incrementally expanded the boundary of the black—</p>
<p>He was on his way down before he knew he’d started. Kid in the pond,
kid in the pond, ran repetitively through his head as he minced.
Progress was tree-to-tree. Standing there panting, you got to know a
tree well. This one had three knots: eye, eye, nose. This started out as
one tree and became two.</p>
<p>Suddenly he was not purely the dying guy who woke nights in the
med-bed thinking, Make this not true make this not true, but again,
partly, the guy who used to put bananas in the freezer, then crack them
on the counter and pour chocolate over the broken chunks, the guy who’d
once stood outside a classroom window in a rainstorm to see how Jodi was
faring with that little red-headed shit who wouldn’t give her a chance
at the book table, the guy who used to hand-paint bird feeders in
college and sell them on weekends in Boulder, wearing a jester hat and
doing a little juggling routine he’d—</p>
<p>He started to fall again, caught himself, froze in a hunched-over
position, hurtled forward, fell flat on his face, chucked his chin on a
root.</p>
<p>You had to laugh.</p>
<p>You almost had to laugh.</p>
<p>He got up. Got doggedly up. His right hand presented as a bloody
glove. Tough nuts, too bad. Once, in football, a tooth had come out.
Later in the half, Eddie Blandik had found it. He’d taken it from Eddie,
flung it away. That had also been him.</p>
<p>Here was the switchbank. It wasn’t far now. Switchback.</p>
<p>What to do? When he got there? Get kid out of pond. Get kid moving.
Force-walk kid through woods, across soccer field, to one of the houses
on Poole. If nobody home, pile kid into Nissan, crank up heater, drive
to— Our Lady of Sorrows? UrgentCare? Fastest route to UrgentCare?</p>
<p>Fifty yards to the trailhead.</p>
<p>Twenty yards to the trailhead.</p>
<p>Thank you, God, for my strength.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>In the pond, he was all animal-thought, no words, no self, blind
panic. He resolved to really try. He grabbed for the edge. The edge
broke away. Down he went. He hit mud and pushed up. He grabbed for the
edge. The edge broke away. Down he went. It seemed like it should be
easy, getting out. But he just couldn’t do it. It was like at the
carnival. It should be easy to knock three sawdust dogs off a ledge. And
it was easy. It just wasn’t easy with the number of balls they gave
you.</p>
<p>He wanted the shore. He knew that was the right place for him. But
the pond kept saying no.</p>
<p>Then it said maybe.</p>
<p>The ice edge broke again, but, breaking it, he pulled himself
infinitesimally toward shore, so that, when he went down, his feet found
mud sooner. The bank was sloped. Suddenly there was hope. He went nuts.
He went total spaz. Then he was out, water streaming off him, a piece of
ice like a tiny pane of glass in the cuff of his coat sleeve.</p>
<p>Trapezoidal, he thought.</p>
<p>In his mind, the pond was not finite, circular, and behind him but
infinite and all around.</p>
<p>He felt he’d better lie still or whatever had just tried to kill him
would try again. What had tried to kill him was not just in the pond but
out here, too, in every natural thing, and there was no him, no Suzanne,
no Mom, no nothing, just the sound of some kid crying like a terrified
baby.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Eber jog-hobbled out of the woods and found: no kid. Just black
water. And a green coat. His coat. His former coat, out there on the
ice. The water was calming already.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Your fault.</p>
<p>Kid was only out there because of—</p>
<p>Down on the beach near an overturned boat was some ignoramus. Lying
face down. On the job. Lying down on the job. Must have been lying there
even as that poor kid—</p>
<p>Wait, rewind.</p>
<p>It was the kid. Oh, thank Christ. Face down like a corpse in a Brady
photo. Legs still in the pond. Like he’d lost steam crawling out. Kid
was soaked through, the white coat gone gray with wet.</p>
<p>Eber dragged the kid out. It took four distinct pulls. He didn’t have
the strength to flip him over, but, turning the head, at least got the
mouth out of the snow.</p>
<p>Kid was in trouble.</p>
<p>Soaking wet, ten degrees.</p>
<p>Doom.</p>
<p>Eber went down on one knee and told the kid in a grave fatherly way
that he had to get up, had to get moving or he could lose his legs, he
could die.</p>
<p>The kid looked at Eber, blinked, stayed where he was.</p>
<p>He grabbed the kid by the coat, rolled him over, roughly sat him up.
The kid’s shivers made his shivers look like nothing. Kid seemed to be
holding a jackhammer. He had to get the kid warmed up. How to do it? Hug
him, lie on top of him? That would be like Popsicle-on-Popsicle.</p>
<p>Eber remembered his coat, out on the ice, at the edge of the black
water.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Find a branch. No branches anywhere. Where the heck was a good fallen
branch when you—</p>
<p>All right, all right, he’d do it without a branch.</p>
<p>He walked fifty feet downshore, stepped onto the pond, walked a wide
loop on the solid stuff, turned to shore, started toward the black
water. His knees were shaking. Why? He was afraid he might fall in. Ha.
Dope. Poser. The coat was fifteen feet away. His legs were in revolt.
His legs were revolting.</p>
<p>Doctor, my legs are revolting.</p>
<p>You’re telling me.</p>
<p>He tiny-stepped up. The coat was ten feet away. He went down on his
knees, knee-walked slightly up. Went down on his belly. Stretched out an
arm.</p>
<p>Slid forward on his belly.</p>
<p>Bit more.</p>
<p>Bit more.</p>
<p>Then had a tiny corner by two fingers. He hauled it in, slid himself
back via something like a reverse breaststroke, got to his knees, stood,
retreated a few steps, and was once again fifteen feet away and
safe.</p>
<p>Then it was like the old days, getting Tommy or Jodi ready for bed
when they were zonked. You said, “Arm,” the kid lifted an arm. You said,
“Other arm,” the kid lifted the other arm. With the coat off, Eber could
see that the boy’s shirt was turning to ice. Eber peeled the shirt off.
Poor little guy. A person was just some meat on a frame. Little guy
wouldn’t last long in this cold. Eber took off his pajama shirt, put it
on the kid, slid the kid’s arm into the arm of the coat. In the arm were
Eber’s hat and gloves. He put the hat and gloves on the kid, zipped the
coat up.</p>
<p>The kid’s pants were frozen solid. His boots were ice sculptures of
boots.</p>
<p>You had to do things right. Eber sat on the boat, took off his boots
and socks, peeled off his pajama pants, made the kid sit on the boat,
knelt before the kid, got the kid’s boots off. He loosened the pants up
with little punches and soon had one leg partly out. He was stripping
off a kid in ten-degree weather. Maybe this was exactly the wrong thing.
Maybe he’d kill the kid. He didn’t know. He just didn’t know.
Desperately, he gave the pants a few more punches. Then the kid was
stepping out.</p>
<p>Eber put the pajama pants on him, then the socks, then the boots.</p>
<p>The kid was standing there in Eber’s clothes, swaying, eyes
closed.</p>
<p>We’re going to walk now, O.K.? Eber said.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Eber gave the kid an encouraging pop in the shoulders. Like a
football thing.</p>
<p>We’re going to walk you home, he said. Do you live near here?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>He gave a harder pop.</p>
<p>The kid gaped at him, baffled.</p>
<p>Pop.</p>
<p>Kid started walking.</p>
<p>Pop-pop.</p>
<p>Like fleeing.</p>
<p>Eber drove the kid out ahead of him. Like cowboy and cow. At first,
fear of the popping seemed to be motivating the kid, but then good old
panic kicked in and he started running. Soon Eber couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>Kid was at the bench. Kid was at the trailhead.</p>
<p>Good boy, get home.</p>
<p>Kid disappeared into the woods.</p>
<p>Eber came back to himself.</p>
<p>Oh, boy. Oh, wow.</p>
<p>He had never known cold. Had never known tired.</p>
<p>He was standing in the snow in his underwear near an overturned
boat.</p>
<p>He hobbled to the boat and sat in the snow.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Robin ran.</p>
<p>Past the bench and the trailhead and into the woods on the old
familiar path.</p>
<p>What the heck? What the heck had just happened? He’d fallen into the
pond? His jeans had frozen solid? Had ceased being bluejeans. Were
whitejeans. He looked down to see if his jeans were still
whitejeans.</p>
<p>He had on pajama pants that, tucked into some tremendoid boots,
looked like clown pants.</p>
<p>Had he been crying just now?</p>
<p>I think crying is healthy, Suzanne said. It means you’re in touch
with your feelings.</p>
<p>Ugh. That was done, that was stupid, talking in your head to some
girl who in real life called you Roger.</p>
<p>Dang.</p>
<p>So tired.</p>
<p>Here was a stump.</p>
<p>He sat. It felt good to rest. He wasn’t going to lose his legs. They
didn’t even hurt. He couldn’t even feel them. He wasn’t going to die.
Dying was not something he had in mind at this early an age. To rest
more efficiently, he lay down. The sky was blue. The pines swayed. Not
all at the same rate. He raised one gloved hand and watched it
tremor.</p>
<p>He might close his eyes for a bit. Sometimes in life one felt a
feeling of wanting to quit. Then everyone would see. Everyone would see
that teasing wasn’t nice. Sometimes with all the teasing his days were
subtenable. Sometimes he felt he couldn’t take even one more lunchtime
of meekly eating on that rolled-up wrestling mat in the cafeteria corner
near the snapped parallel bars. He did not have to sit there. But
preferred to. If he sat anywhere else, there was the chance of a comment
or two. Upon which he would then have the rest of the day to reflect.
Sometimes comments were made on the clutter of his home. Thanks to
Bryce, who had once come over. Sometimes comments were made on his
manner of speaking. Sometimes comments were made on the style faux pas
of Mom. Who was, it must be said, a real eighties gal.</p>
<p>Mom.</p>
<p>He did not like it when they teased about Mom. Mom had no idea of his
lowly school status. Mom seeing him more as the paragon or golden-boy
type.</p>
<p>Once, he’d done a secret rendezvous of recording Mom’s phone calls,
just for the reconnaissance aspect. Mostly they were dull, mundane, not
about him at all.</p>
<p>Except for this one with her friend Liz.</p>
<p>I never dreamed I could love someone so much, Mom had said. I just
worry I might not be able to live up to him, you know? He’s so good, so
grateful. That kid deserves—that kid deserves it all. Better school,
which we cannot afford, some trips, like abroad, but that is also, uh,
out of our price range. I just don’t want to fail him, you know? That’s
all I want from my life, you know? Liz? To feel, at the end, like I did
right by that magnificent little dude.</p>
<p>At that point it seemed like Liz had maybe started vacuuming.</p>
<p>Magnificent little dude.</p>
<p>He should probably get going.</p>
<p>Magnificent Little Dude was like his Indian name.</p>
<p>He got to his feet and, gathering his massive amount of clothes up
like some sort of encumbering royal train, started toward home.</p>
<p>Here was the truck tire, here the place where the trail briefly
widened, here the place where the trees crossed overhead like reaching
for one another. Weave-ceiling, Mom called it.</p>
<p>Here was the soccer field. Across the field, his house sat like a big
sweet animal. It was amazing. He’d made it. He’d fallen into the pond
and lived to tell the tale. He had somewhat cried, yes, but had then
simply laughed off this moment of mortal weakness and made his way home,
look of wry bemusement on his face, having, it must be acknowledged,
benefitted from the much appreciated assistance of a certain aged—</p>
<p>With a shock he remembered the old guy. What the heck? An image
flashed of the old guy standing bereft and blue-skinned in his
tighty-whities like a P.O.W. abandoned at the barbed wire due to no room
on the truck. Or a sad traumatized stork bidding farewell to its
young.</p>
<p>He’d bolted. He’d bolted on the old guy. Hadn’t even given him a
thought.</p>
<p>Blimey.</p>
<p>What a chickenshittish thing to do.</p>
<p>He had to go back. Right now. Help the old guy hobble out. But he was
so tired. He wasn’t sure he could do it. Probably the old guy was fine.
Probably he had some sort of old-guy plan.</p>
<p>But he’d bolted. He couldn’t live with that. His mind was telling him
that the only way to undo the bolting was to go back now, save the day.
His body was saying something else: It’s too far, you’re just a kid, get
Mom, Mom will know what to do.</p>
<p>He stood paralyzed at the edge of the soccer field like a scarecrow
in huge flowing clothes.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Eber sat slumped against the boat.</p>
<p>What a change in the weather. People were going around with parasols
and so forth in the open part of the park. There was a merry-go-round
and a band and a gazebo. People were frying food on the backs of certain
merry-go-round horses. And yet, on others, kids were riding. How did
they know? Which horses were hot? For now there was still snow, but snow
couldn’t last long in this bomb.</p>
<p>Balm.</p>
<p>If you close your eyes, that’s the end. You know that, right?</p>
<p>Hilarious.</p>
<p>Allen.</p>
<p>His exact voice. After all these years.</p>
<p>Where was he? The duck pond. So many times he’d come out here with
the kids. He should go now. Goodbye, duck pond. Although hang on. He
couldn’t seem to stand. Plus you couldn’t leave a couple of little kids
behind. Not this close to water. They were four and six. For God’s sake.
What had he been thinking? Leaving those two little dears by the pond.
They were good kids, they’d wait, but wouldn’t they get bored? And swim?
Without life jackets? No, no, no. It made him sick. He had to stay. Poor
kids. Poor abandoned—</p>
<p>Wait, rewind.</p>
<p>His kids were excellent swimmers.</p>
<p>His kids had never come close to being abandoned.</p>
<p>His kids were grown.</p>
<p>Tom was thirty. Tall drink of water. Tried so hard to know things.
But even when he thought he knew a thing (fighting kites, breeding
rabbits) Tom would soon be shown for what he was: the dearest, most
agreeable young man ever, who knew no more about fighting kites/breeding
rabbits than the average person could pick up from ten minutes on the
Internet. Not that Tom wasn’t smart. Tom was smart. Tom was a damn quick
study. Oh, Tom, Tommy, Tommikins! The heart in that kid! He just worked
and worked. For the love of his dad. Oh, kid, you had it, you have it,
Tom, Tommy, even now I am thinking of you, you are very much on my
mind.</p>
<p>And Jodi, Jodi was out there in Santa Fe. She’d said she’d take off
work and fly home. As needed. But there was no need. He didn’t like to
impose. The kids had their own lives. Jodi-Jode. Little freckle-face.
Pregnant now. Not married. Not even dating. Stupid Lars. What kind of
man deserted a beautiful girl like that? A total dear. Just starting to
make some progress in her job. You couldn’t take that kind of time off
when you’d only just started—</p>
<p>Reconstructing the kids in this way was having the effect of making
them real to him again. Which—you didn’t want to get that ball roiling.
Jodi was having a baby. Rolling. He could have lasted long enough to see
the baby. Hold the baby. It was sad, yes. That was a sacrifice he’d had
to make. He’d explained it in the note. Hadn’t he? No. Hadn’t left a
note. Couldn’t. There’d been some reason he couldn’t. Hadn’t there? He
was pretty sure there’d been some—</p>
<p>Insurance. It couldn’t seem like he’d done it on purpose.</p>
<p>Little panic.</p>
<p>Little panic here.</p>
<p>He was offing himself. Offing himself, he’d involved a kid. Who was
wandering the woods hypothermic. Offing himself two weeks before
Christmas. Molly’s favorite holiday. Molly had a valve thing, a panic
thing, this business might—</p>
<p>This was not—this was not him. This was not something he would have
done. Not something he would ever do. Except he—he’d done it. He was
doing it. It was in progress. If he didn’t get moving, it would—it would
be accomplished. It would be done.</p>
<p>This very day you will be with me in the kingdom of—</p>
<p>He had to fight.</p>
<p>But couldn’t seem to keep his eyes open.</p>
<p>He tried to send some last thoughts to Molly. Sweetie, forgive me.
Biggest fuckup ever. Forget this part. Forget I ended this thisly. You
know me. You know I didn’t mean this.</p>
<p>He was at his house. He wasn’t at his house. He knew that. But could
see every detail. Here was the empty med-bed, the studio portrait of
HimMollyTommyJodi posed around that fake rodeo fence. Here was the
little bedside table. His meds in the pillbox. The bell he rang to call
Molly. What a thing. What a cruel thing. Suddenly he saw clearly how
cruel it was. And selfish. Oh, God. Who was he? The front door swung
open. Molly called his name. He’d hide in the sunroom. Jump out,
surprise her. Somehow they’d remodelled. Their sunroom was now the
sunroom of Mrs. Kendall, his childhood piano teacher. That would be fun
for the kids, to take piano lessons in the same room where he’d—</p>
<p>Hello? Mrs. Kendall said.</p>
<p>What she meant was: Don’t die yet. There are many of us who wish to
judge you harshly in the sunroom.</p>
<p>Hello, hello! she shouted.</p>
<p>Coming around the pond was a silver-haired woman.</p>
<p>All he had to do was call out.</p>
<p>He called out.</p>
<p>To keep him alive she started piling on him various things from life,
things smelling of a home—coats, sweaters, a rain of flowers, a hat,
socks, sneakers—and with amazing strength had him on his feet and was
maneuvering him into a maze of trees, a wonderland of trees, trees hung
with ice. He was piled high with clothes. He was like the bed at a party
on which they pile the coats. She had all the answers: where to step,
when to rest. She was strong as a bull. He was on her hip now like a
baby; she had both arms around his waist, lifting him over a root.</p>
<p>They walked for hours, seemed like. She sang. Cajoled. She hissed at
him, reminding him, with pokes in the forehead (right in his forehead),
that her freaking kid was at home, near-frozen, so they had to book
it.</p>
<p>Good God, there was so much to do. If he made it. He’d make it. This
gal wouldn’t let him not make it. He’d have to try to get Molly to
see—see why he’d done it. I was scared, I was scared, Mol. Maybe Molly
would agree not to tell Tommy and Jodi. He didn’t like the thought of
them knowing he’d been scared. Didn’t like the thought of them knowing
what a fool he’d been. Oh, to hell with that! Tell everyone! He’d done
it! He’d been driven to do it and he’d done it and that was it. That was
him. That was part of who he was. No more lies, no more silence, it was
going to be a new and different life, if only he—</p>
<p>They were crossing the soccer field.</p>
<p>Here was the Nissan.</p>
<p>His first thought was: Get in, drive it home.</p>
<p>Oh, no, you don’t, she said with that smoky laugh and guided him into
a house. A house on the park. He’d seen it a million times. And now was
in it. It smelled of man-sweat and spaghetti sauce and old books. Like a
library where sweaty men went to cook spaghetti. She sat him in front of
a woodstove, brought him a brown blanket that smelled of medicine.
Didn’t talk but in directives: Drink this, let me take that, wrap up,
what’s your name, what’s your number?</p>
<p>What a thing! To go from dying in your underwear in the snow to this!
Warmth, colors, antlers on the walls, an old-time crank phone like you
saw in silent movies. It was something. Every second was something. He
hadn’t died in his shorts by a pond in the snow. The kid wasn’t dead.
He’d killed no one. Ha! Somehow he’d got it all back. Everything was
good now, everything was—</p>
<p>The woman reached down, touched his scar.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, ouch, she said. You didn’t do that out there, did you?</p>
<p>At this he remembered that the brown spot was as much in his head as
ever.</p>
<p>Oh, Lord, there was still all that to go through.</p>
<p>Did he still want it? Did he still want to live?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, oh, God, yes, please.</p>
<p>Because, O.K., the thing was—he saw it now, was starting to see it—if
some guy, at the end, fell apart, and said or did bad things, or had to
be helped, helped to quite a considerable extent? So what? What of it?
Why should he not do or say weird things or look strange or disgusting?
Why should the shit not run down his legs? Why should those he loved not
lift and bend and feed and wipe him, when he would gladly do the same
for them? He’d been afraid to be lessened by the lifting and bending and
feeding and wiping, and was still afraid of that, and yet, at the same
time, now saw that there could still be many—many drops of goodness, is
how it came to him—many drops of happy—of good fellowship—ahead, and
those drops of fellowship were not—had never been—his to withheld.</p>
<p>Withhold.</p>
<p>The kid came out of the kitchen, lost in Eber’s big coat, pajama
pants pooling around his feet with the boots now off. He took Eber’s
bloody hand gently. Said he was sorry. Sorry for being such a dope in
the woods. Sorry for running off. He’d just been out of it. Kind of
scared and all.</p>
<p>Listen, Eber said hoarsely. You did amazing. You did perfect. I’m
here. Who did that?</p>
<p>There. That was something you could do. The kid maybe felt better
now? He’d given the kid that? That was a reason. To stay around. Wasn’t
it? Can’t console anyone if not around? Can’t do squat if gone?</p>
<p>When Allen was close to the end, Eber had done a presentation at
school on the manatee. Got an A from Sister Eustace. Who could be quite
tough. She was missing two fingers on her right hand from a lawnmower
incident and sometimes used that hand to scare a kid silent.</p>
<p>He hadn’t thought of this in years.</p>
<p>She’d put that hand on his shoulder not to scare him but as a form of
praise. That was just terrific. Everyone should take their work as
seriously as Donald here. Donald, I hope you’ll go home and share this
with your parents. He’d gone home and shared it with Mom. Who suggested
he share it with Allen. Who, on that day, had been more Allen than that.
And Allen—</p>
<p>Ha, wow, Allen. There was a man.</p>
<p>Tears sprang into his eyes as he sat by the woodstove.</p>
<p>Allen had—Allen had said it was great. Asked a few questions. About
the manatee. What did they eat again? Did he think they could
effectively communicate with one another? What a trial that must have
been! In his condition. Forty minutes on the manatee? Including a poem
Eber had composed? A sonnet? On the manatee?</p>
<p>He’d felt so happy to have Allen back.</p>
<p>I’ll be like him, he thought. I’ll try to be like him.</p>
<p>The voice in his head was shaky, hollow, unconvinced.</p>
<p>Then: sirens.</p>
<p>Somehow: Molly.</p>
<p>He heard her in the entryway. Mol, Molly, oh, boy. When they were
first married they used to fight. Say the most insane things. Afterward,
sometimes there would be tears. Tears in bed? Somewhere. And then they
would—Molly pressing her hot wet face against his hot wet face. They
were sorry, they were saying with their bodies, they were accepting each
other back, and that feeling, that feeling of being accepted back again
and again, of someone’s affection for you always expanding to encompass
whatever new flawed thing had just manifested in you, that was the
deepest, dearest thing he’d ever—</p>
<p>She came in flustered and apologetic, a touch of anger in her face.
He’d embarrassed her. He saw that. He’d embarrassed her by doing
something that showed she hadn’t sufficiently noticed him needing her.
She’d been too busy nursing him to notice how scared he was. She was
angry at him for pulling this stunt and ashamed of herself for feeling
angry at him in his hour of need, and was trying to put the shame and
anger behind her now so she could do what might be needed.</p>
<p>All of this was in her face. He knew her so well.</p>
<p>Also concern.</p>
<p>Overriding everything else in that lovely face was concern.</p>
<p>She came to him now, stumbling a bit on a swell in the floor of this
stranger’s house.</p>
