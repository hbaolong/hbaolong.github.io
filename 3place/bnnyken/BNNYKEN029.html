<h4 id="the-bookseller">The Bookseller</h4>
<p>By Elizabeth Hardwick (1980)</p>
<p>Saturday, November. Winter, thank heaven. Everyone is wearing
something new in the fall line. Skirts are shorter and heels are,
thereby, lower. Quite old ladies are in schoolgirl sweaters and men far
from young are on silent roller skates—curving backward, slowly spinning
around to make a deft, brilliant, soundless stop on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>November. People have stopped going to their country places for the
weekend, because, it is said, there is too much going on in the city.
How true that is. At the opera, machines float swans across the back of
the stage and hurl swords through the air; ballet fans are gossiping on
the mezzanine; the hardy are standing in fur or in fat jackets of
spring-garden pinks and purples in the long lines outside the movie
houses. The city people are as strong as athletes and in elevated
spiritual condition, too. Happy hours inside the darkened halls, with so
many performing up front in a flood of light. Creamy faces on the
screen; thin chiffons and heavy velvets on the stage. He leaping,
leaping, and she folding her arms in dejection, like the wings of a
bird; another reaching so high, up, up, singing of her lover’s treachery
to the cause of her father. Saturday night, sold out.</p>
<p>The cafés are steaming, and from the restaurant doors garlic floats
toward the hoods of cars waiting for the light. The newspaper kiosks
have tomorrow’s papers stacked outside and, as always, Roger’s
secondhand bookstore on Columbus Avenue is open for business. The store
is called The Pleiade, but Roger likes to refer to it as the “play aid.”
He says he has learned to watch out for strangers who can pronounce the
name properly, because they know what they are doing and are sure to
steal him blind. This caution is not, in fact, Roger’s way at all. He
approaches theft—the thin volumes hiding in overcoats and the large
volumes in shopping bags—with a short cry of pain and a long journey
into his imagination, where he finds some poor truant, beaten down by
self-awareness like the man in “Notes from Underground,” poring with
fevered eyes over his treasure.</p>
<p>It is almost eleven when we stop at the shop. Roger says: The
overflow from “The Marriage of Maria Braun” is terrific.</p>
<p>Roger is a large man, with sand-colored skin and hair of a curious
tan shade, and he is dressed in a sand-colored corduroy jacket with
leather patches on the elbows. The elbow patches and the pipe he
sometimes smokes do not give him the air of a professor or of a
sportsman. He is too seedy and rumpled and sand-strewn for that. He is
just the benign, beaming, outsized owner of The Pleiade, and he and his
shop are rooted like cabbages in the mixed sod of Columbus Avenue.</p>
<p>Yes, a lot is going on, but Roger never goes to the opera, never goes
to the ballet, seldom goes to the movies. He is stuck in his shop, like
a flagpole on the village green. He is a man with a single overwhelming
passion out of which his being flows. The modernist classics are his
passion. Reverence, the tensions of love, the restlessness of pursuit
inflect his utterance of the sacred names. Photographs of Frenchmen,
Russians, Americans, Italians, martyrs of inspiration, are in frames on
the walls of The Pleiade, and their mostly sombre images, caught in the
youth of radical invention, are lit like icons by the candle of Roger’s
beaming eyes. He is haunted by memories. Where, oh where, is his lost
copy of “A Barbarian in Asia” with the luck of Michaux’s signature
circled by cryptic drawings?</p>
<p>Roger and his books. His old friends are aware that he does not quite
read them and that there is no word accurate for his curious taking in.
He flips through the volumes delicately, carefully, and in some
agitation of mind and spirit. His classics, with their almost
constitutional authority, live under a kind of glass in his admiration.
New books, not quite yesterday’s or even of the last few years, he
receives kindly and with generous hope, and he is quick to sort out
those that have about them certain whisperings of futurity, of
longevity. But it is not true that Roger has no knowledge of his books.
The truth is that he knows them in an intimate, peculiar fashion. He
knows well each flavor, each spécialité, each domain, and the very
quality of the aspiration. In his cheerful heart all the ironies,
overturnings, dissonances of modern art ring out their sad notes and
fill him with happiness.</p>
<p>If one were to say: Roger, do you admire Bruno Schulz?, he would
answer: Oh, yes, oh, yes. And then, reflecting, he might add: But I like
“Crocodile Street” better than “Sanatorium.” He has made a judgment,
reached into the bibliophile quarry that is his head, and brought to
life the elusive pages with their type, their chapter headings, their
beginnings and endings, their place-names that sparkle with fresh
consonants and vowels. And he knows what there is to know of lives—the
terrible struggles of authorship that have undone so many.</p>
<p>At The Pleiade, a thin young woman, with hair cold and shiny like a
wet cap, set over large, steady eyes, is drinking coffee at a long table
at the back. Lois, Roger says.</p>
<p>Up front, there stands on tiptoe a not unusual bookshop scarecrow in
black trousers, frayed jacket, and painful shoes long worn by feet much
larger than the feet currently trying to find a grounding in them. This
pitiful person is holding a book some distance from his eyes. Crazy,
Roger says.</p>
<p>A very large dog, like a huge ball of dust, sleeps in the middle of
the shop and must be circled by the customers. So it is, with small
variations, seven nights a week at The Pleiade. Now a young couple,
whispering, examine the titles on the shelves. Roger’s eagerness follows
their glances. He is in search of essence, the young couple’s essence,
to be revealed to him as a hand pulls a volume forward and then slowly
pushes it back into place. Roger sees the light of recognition and the
blankness of ignorance.</p>
<p>Pound’s “ABC,” the young man whispers to the girl. Twenty-five
dollars. The expensive jewel lies in the young man’s palm for a moment
and then is returned to its alphabetical resting place.</p>
<p>Roger watches the unrolling, as it seems to him, of their biography.
He is deeply interested, although the couple do not reveal any
eccentricity and their passage through poetry, criticism, art, and
fiction is unremarkable. But there is a longing, perhaps, a tenderness
and wonder, before first American edition and original English edition,
before the contemplation of the out-of-print, the signed, and the
limited.</p>
<p>At last, the girl buys a paperback for two dollars and fifty cents.
“Kafka’s Diaries,” Volume I. Roger’s smile seems to fade a bit, although
not in dishonor to Kafka, for whom he feels a love almost criminal. The
fading seems to be a disappointment that the young couple had been thus
far deprived of the volume.</p>
<p>They go out in their matching ski jackets, jog down the avenue with
their blond hair flying behind. Roger collects his decisions about them.
Poets, he says. I think they live downtown, but not in the East Village.
Something like West Tenth Street. Respectable types, Amherst and
Wellesley. Those two are spacing lines on a page.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Roger. I can see again his large head bowed, as if in grief, in the
Milton seminar at Columbia some years ago. He brought to graduate
studies his pen and his notebook and the steady downward tug of his
dilatory, procrastinating nature. It was the modernist T. S. Eliot and
his resurrection of the metaphysical poets that had led Roger
disastrously to the seventeenth century. By the perverse authority of
institutions he was brutally dragged by his light curls into the study
of Milton, a poet not even very high in the regard of Eliot at the time.
Roger endured for a few months. He wrote in the margins of “The
Student’s Milton”: “Cf. Virgil,” after one line; and “See Pliny the
Elder,” after another; and at the top of a page “Pythagoras was the only
one who had heard the spheres’ music.”</p>
<p>But his head was too big and his eyes were too small for the peering
at lines, and he shuffled about in the text like a melancholy sheep in a
pen. At last, he gave up and went cheerfully loping off into the meadow
of upper Broadway, and came to a stop some years later as the proprietor
of The Pleiade. And yet, even now, Roger can sometimes be heard in the
doorway of his shop, greeting a friend with “Hail, holy light!,” the
only phrase from “Paradise Lost” sequestered in his memory.</p>
<p>Roger knows well a number of regular visitors to The Pleiade and he
has friends, themselves a miscellaneous collection, from his Columbia
undergraduate days. He knows a French-literature scholar, a Socialist, a
Catholic poet, and a lawyer who plays the violin and reads Kleist and
Novalis in German.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The night is ending and Lois is nodding at the table. Before Lois,
Maureen was for some months sitting at the table, sitting there silent
and beautiful and abstracted—very, very much in the Lois manner.</p>
<p>Where is Maureen?</p>
<p>Gone for a spell to the topless towers, Roger says. Is there regret
in his tone? No, not exactly. It is Roger’s way to meet fate with the
sweetest accommodation of the trivial or the violent alteration.
Profound passivity, a little wonder, and a flash of puzzlement here and
there, and the flux of his domestic arrangements serenely made its way
to sea. For this, the troubled people who floated down on him, as if he
were a pier for a sudden anchorage, were perhaps grateful.</p>
<p>The topless towers was his designation of Maureen’s home town, Troy,
New York. And it was there she would go when the peaceful vacancy of her
nature took a little turn to the left or right and she had to be got
back on the road again.</p>
<p>Lois is a friend of Maureen’s, Roger explains. She’s looking for
work.</p>
<p>Lois nods, and her meditative gaze is so untroubled that it has the
effect of a signal of trouble itself.</p>
<p>From time to time, the iron gates over the front of The Pleiade
remained closed past noon, and some of Roger’s commercial neighbors were
taken by curiosity. The cook from the Chinese restaurant often walked
out in his apron and peered through the gated windows into the impatient
jaws of the dog. The fat palmist, awaiting the evacuation sure to arrive
when the landlord, stuck with the derelict for so many years, could
decide to what brilliant, prosperous use the palmist’s street-front
broom closet might be put, glared with deep intention at the locked
gates, as if she had at last accomplished a predicted malediction. There
was no cordiality between Roger and the palmist, because he detested the
occult and the pornographic and, to him, the palmist united the two in
her black coils of hair and in the beseeching, whimpering noises
directed at passersby.</p>
<p>But soon there would come Roger in a taxi, and out of the taxi came
shopping bags filled with more books bought from a bankrupt
hole-in-the-wall competitor. The gates rolled back, the cut-rate bin was
trundled to the pavement, and the luckless, sneering palmist saw The
Pleiade’s Mostly Mozart poster return to life. The slim volumes again
dozed in the afternoon light. The large volumes of the “High
Renaissance” and “The History of Egyptian Art” listened once more to the
gassy braking of the No. 11 bus. All was well, except that Roger was
undergoing a brief sinking spell because of the new burden of his
infatuated buying.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Roger does not drink, but he eats quite a lot of apples, pizzas, and
hamburgers, and makes many cups of coffee in his electric pot. He lives
in the large, decaying building over the shop. He is one of those
brought up by well-to-do parents, sent to good schools, to France for a
summer—who, on their own, show no more memory of physical comforts than
a prairie dog.</p>
<p>Once, in the bookstore, the lawyer friend spoke about a visit to the
apartment to look at a violin Roger had bought. Lethal squalor, he kept
repeating, lethal squalor. Yet he found in this jumbled, tumbled theatre
of belligerent disorder a fine violin, old paintings of curious
interest, fine brasses black with tarnish, rare books, carved wood:
twenty-five years of desultory buying in junk shops, elephantine
carting, and, at last, forgetful dumping. The lawyer observed that Roger
would never starve but he might die from stepping on a rusty nail.</p>
<p>Roger has his dog, with its concentrated sleepy look, and his
Maureens and Loises with their unconcentrated, dream-heavy eyes. He has
his shop, where he spends his waking hours, and when that is over he
goes upstairs to rest, like a peasant returning to his hut at sundown.
Perhaps he sleeps on a pallet, wrapped in his winter sheepskin in the
unthinkable darkness in which one imagines his bright, daylight smile
there someplace in the clutter, beaming away like a night lamp. No
matter—the patrician in him is not entirely erased and lingers on in an
amiable displacement, remaining in his contentment to keep pace with
just where he is, to raise prices as the rent rises, to keep out the
street winds, to fill the shopping bags with new loot, and to feel a
certain discomfort and confusion when he makes a sale. His father left a
good deal of money, but Roger does no resentful bookkeeping. Instead, he
shows a flare of pride that his mother is in her ninety-sixth year,
consuming the real estate, the insurance, the stocks like an admirable,
slowly grazing animal.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The wind from the river comes up suddenly to disperse the
Saturday-night rubbish. Into the air go newspapers, candy wrappers,
loose tobacco, and the sluggish waters at the curb stir under the tidal
moon. The bookstore empties and Roger sighs in the mixed feelings of the
end of another day of his long, long celebration. He directs Lois to go
across the street to the all-night Puerto Rican grocery store to buy
cornflakes. She looks uncertain of this journey but takes the
five-dollar bill, scurries away among the cars, looking like a small,
blackened crossing sweeper of a century ago.</p>
<p>Majored in fine arts, Roger says. And then, looking up into the sky
in which lights from so many rooms flicker like yellow stars, Roger
drifts for a moment into a mesmerized, speculative mode. In the rooms,
he says, he imagines miserable calculations in every head nodding off to
sleep, figures added and subtracted, dreams of selling the very space
that held the bed upon which the sleeper’s head restlessly lay in its
blur of arithmetic. On the street, he has noticed that people keep
turning around suddenly, as if future income taxes were brushing by,
grazing coats like a pickpocket.</p>
<p>Lois returns, the gates clang before the darkened window, and as they
start up the stairs of the tenement Roger ends his historical reverie.
Those that are not inside counting up, he says, are outside making marks
in indelible ink on every clean wall. Good night, good night.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Some days after, there is Roger at noon explaining things to the
Hungarian woman who has for twenty-two years managed alone her
dry-cleaning establishment and is now to be evicted in an imaginative
glassy renovation which will add its signature to the old avenue’s
petition of hope. Roger is saying: Landless peasants, that is what we
are. Till the soil for centuries and then the messenger comes from
St. Petersburg to say the master wants his hectares for an iron
foundry.</p>
<p>The dry-cleaning woman says: Mr. Spiegel does not live in
St. Petersburg but in Bay Ridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Roger, gregarious as a housefly, is not one asked to dinner at the
home of his friends, although he presents a respectable bohemian
appearance. He has not accumulated anything for social use and is no
more fit for the inside of things than a flowering bush. The byways of
life have captured him, even captivated his mind, and it is possible to
think that his contentment comes from never having to set out the
dishes, watch the oven, make drinks, freeze ice, have coffee cups ready
and table chairs assembled. And his curiosity is disarming—harmless,
quickly satisfied, unassuming, wide rather than deep. It is a sort of
credulous, favorable curiosity and surrounds him like heat.</p>
<p>His memory for names is extraordinary. It is names he stores up out
of the daily Times. Names of painters, names of sopranos, names of
leftists and rightists, of murderers, of architects, of film directors,
and, above all, the names of writers to go with their titles. These
names lie on his brain, smothering it, like the blanketing of the
acquisitions in his apartment. His cumulative index of dead and live
souls, jangling bits of change with the pennies, nickels, and dimes of
celebrity, often has a dampening effect on conversation and, being
all-identifying information as it is, the terms of exchange cannot be
agreed upon.</p>
<p>Obscure persons, those of some past accomplishment lying under the
settled dust, are alarmed by Roger’s mysterious recognitions. They start
in embarrassment, seeming to fear they have been picked out of the heap
by mistake.</p>
<p>Aren’t you ——, author of ——? Roger asks with perfect courtesy.</p>
<p>How did you recognize me?</p>
<p>To this Roger can only reply that in truth he does not know. And he
is unprepared for the burden his keen eye, his genial salute represented
to the modest, the shy, and also to the arrogant.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>What is the noise in the back of The Pleiade? Like the sound of some
smoothly running machine pleased to be doing its part. It is Roger and
the great energy of his friendly, healthy, untroubled ways.
Unaccountable exertions at the table in the back of the shop. Roger is
typing away at an impressive speed, racing along as confidently as an
alert stenographer in court. Behind him, stacked in neat black binders,
are the thirteen novels he has written on the typewriter. During the
slowness just before the dinner hour, there he is, sitting straight and
tall for the protection of his back during his labors. Coffee cools
beside him, a cheeseburger waits in its wrapping paper. Clang, clang,
clang! Loud, joyful clangs from his thick, strong fingers. In goes a
sheet of paper to be greeted by the happy rhythmical clatter and soon
with a quick, practiced twist out it comes with a very pleasant zing,
and another page rolls in. Pure pleasure rattles through Roger’s body as
the neat, perfectly typed pages pile up. What gladness in numbers:
Chapter 7, page 210.</p>
<p>The pages arrive as if telephoned by the stack of index cards on the
right, which contain, sketched in Roger’s fine script, the characters
who are sending the messages.</p>
<p>From an early work: Desmond, thirty-two, in the O.S.S. on the
European front, World War II. English by birth but American citizen
after marriage to Melissa, proper Bostonian background. These two were
to be involved in a tangle of unbelievable but nevertheless predictable
complication.</p>
<p>The gathering ledgers—for that is what they appear to be—ledgers with
indecipherable figures noting some forgotten transaction, have seen the
creation of disaster plots, cancer plots, celebrity-scandal plots,
regional plots, international plots. But there is nothing at all in the
stacks of black binders of the avant-garde, nothing of the beloved
discordance of modernism, that is the pride of the bookshelves, the
consolation of the proprietor. The violent, ecstatic typing—so like a
fantastic, rejuvenating regime of arcane exercises. The pile of crisp
pages sometimes goes out to the world in envelopes, and the return
causes no discouragement.</p>
<p>The French scholar, a lonely man and a terrible snob with an almost
paranoid resentment of certain French works in current esteem, among
them the poetry of Francis Ponge and the essays of Cioran, often says: I
do not understand this deranged typing. It is not hope of fame, of
money, or even of publication. It is not anything that can be known.</p>
<p>And he tells of seeing Roger once in a mood of despair as he sat
ready to attack the keys. A work in the autobiographical mode was
planned, but a painful interruption, a stiffening, a paralysis struck
Roger after only a dozen or so pages. Mournfully, he appealed to his
reliable fingers, the faithful engines, but they could not be urged to
move along. At last, he said: The “I” is not for me. The sheet came out,
the black leather cover was placed over the typewriter with the
solemnity of defeat—a burial.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Disquieting events at The Pleiade, in December. Maureen returns
suddenly from Troy, looking beautiful, with her tranquil eyes, her short
curls, and wearing a graceful skirt of Indian cotton.</p>
<p>Sprung, Roger says.</p>
<p>Now Maureen sits at the back of the shop with Lois, also in her full
beauty, if somehow edging into dishevelment, save for a new pair of
expensive light-blue leather boots, stitched with patterns of pink
roses.</p>
<p>They might be Roger’s daughters. And what are they? Mistresses? They
and the sulky despot, Jenny, whose reign, before Maureen, tormented the
walls, accused the shelves, menaced with frowns the old New Directions
paperbacks and the first hundred titles of Anchor Books, which Roger,
knight of perfect faith, had assembled.</p>
<p>Jenny, in her forties, had come to Roger like a message in a bottle,
floating from Yugoslavia, where she was born, to London, where she was
briefly married to a second cousin of Roger’s, and on to New York with
the address of The Pleiade in her hand.</p>
<p>Where indeed is Jenny?</p>
<p>New Jersey, Roger says. Relatives. Serbs chanting folktales from the
old oral tradition.</p>
<p>Not one of his friends thinks Maureen or Lois is a mistress. It is
unimaginable because of the presence of some cheerful absence in Roger,
his blameless peculiarity of not seeming to have an interior. For all
his curiosity, he is not inclined to analysis and detail, and those
about whom he is curious come into his view as travelling objects. It is
as if he were to look up and say: That one is blue with yellow stripes
and this one is red and black. Except for the tyrannical Jenny. The
violinist believes there might have been an affair in that corner.</p>
<p>And why does he think so? Her deprecating ill-humor, for one thing,
he answers.</p>
<p>The two girls, Maureen and Lois, were not altogether friendly and
took up more room than the shop could bear. They did not make change,
did not advise about the existence of a title, never opened the
interesting pages of Books in Print. Roger himself swept out in the
morning, and at night, often the wrong one, took his huge plastic bags
of rubbish to the curb for collection. Two girls might have been six
girls, and the multiplication sent Roger into a state of mind unusual
for him, a state of unhappiness and vexation. The unbalancing scheme
seemed to demand something from him, but he was not clear just what that
something might be.</p>
<p>It is not as if they were down and out, he would say with a sigh. He
repeated this again and again, and although the girls were only a few
feet away they did not appear to be listening.</p>
<p>Both girls were indeed cherished by their confused families. They
received money and mail, letters filled with encouragement, letters
grateful that they were in beguiling, promising New York City in order
to get on with their lives. Their home towns, scenes of disappointment
and constriction, were not suitable for advancement. Lois had found
early that in her own Pittsburgh there was nothing happening. The two
had met in a private sanatorium and each had made her way to therapeutic
New York and to the Pleiade hospice. And here they were, in a state of
becoming.</p>
<p>The overpopulation left Roger gasping for air, unable to recover his
stolen placid breathing. The unmoving freight, stalled, lay in his path,
defying all the tools his accepting nature had at hand. He would find
the two silently gazing at the store’s landscape and limply he would
suggest: Shoo! Take a walk.</p>
<p>We are not twins, Maureen would answer. Let Lois take the walk.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The Pleiade is downed by melancholy until Christmas, when Lois is
lifted up by holiday sentiment and one morning abandons the bookshop and
the apartment for the despised Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>She will not be back, Maureen says. It turns out that Lois’s brother
walked up and down in front of The Pleiade, entered the challenging
stairway of the old tenement, looked in wonder like a detective on a
case at Roger, Maureen, the dog, the unkempt and the fashionable
customers, and decided that the setting was not promising for Lois’s
career. With the help of Christmas he led her to take up the trail back
home.</p>
<p>The empty chair reassured, space opened up in Roger’s heart once more
and its steady, comfortable beating returned. The typewriter clanged
from four until six in the afternoon. New classics were magically
restored after the cruelty of time had spent itself. The tides flowed
and Roger swam.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>It is Christmas at The Pleiade. Roger’s days soar as he dispenses, in
the spirit of charity baskets, the gifts of the world. Storytellers from
Africa, epics from Latin America, painful gutting rituals from Japan,
women poets from the Russia of the twenties—the nineteen-twenties, the
period of his first passions, now a hallowed battlefield filled with
noble headstones. Suicides, early death, transfiguration, words, words,
words, in all the tongues of the earth. Roger’s head, with its wrinkled
sandy waves lapping on the shore of his brow, bobs up and down in time
to the sacred music.</p>
<p>On the block, the sepulchre of the old fruit market is now a
mausoleum of oak cabinets and kitchen tables from the back porches of
the Middle West. Taste itself seems to be laughing in the street.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>In January, Maureen dimmed and faded away. The dark star of Jenny,
with her glimmering scowl, ascended without notice. Remarks burst from
her like bullets. He is a toadstool, she would say of Roger in a loud
gunfire.</p>
<p>After a pause of shock, Roger found his aim. You see, I am a
cavaliere servente, he cried out gaily, calling upon page 1 of “The
Charterhouse of Parma.”</p>
<p>Jenny gradually displayed a few marks of chastening. An unwholesome
strain of choleric domesticity invaded her thoughts, a lesson learned.
She had turned a corner, but not the one that led to cooking and
housekeeping. She was making her way, as if by a private radar, to the
interests of ownership. Swift, proprietary gleamings, a sense of things.
Her eyes surveyed the books, the collections, like a guard with his
flashlight making the midnight rounds. Stirrings in the blood, storage
plans for winter, gathering potatoes in the cellar; she was getting
older.</p>
<p>Sometimes one would see her studying a piece of brass or old silver
brought down from the apartment. A pawnbroker’s stare, cynical smile,
and shrug of feigned indifference. Roger did not speak of this
alteration in her attention, but found relief in the fact that she
stayed upstairs a good deal, pushing objects from one corner to another,
making promising groupings, looking for the right screw for a hole, an
old curve that would welcome a stray rosette of gold leaf. No mending,
no polishing. In her fitful accounting all was equal and she might have
been engaged in a nightmare dialogue between buyer and seller. Here is
the missing leg, in perfect shape; here is the piece that completes the
red tail of the dragon on the green china plate; here is Volume IV.
Sorting out, Roger said.</p>
<p>In the middle of March, our lawyer friend who played the violin and
read Kleist and Novalis died. The death dug its teeth into Roger’s soft
heart and he looked backward to remember that the friend had not been in
The Pleiade for a few months and had for the past year appeared frail
and thin. At the Riverside Chapel, we mourned this death of a hero, with
his antique passions, as they seemed, his poets known by heart and whose
lives were shorter than his own.</p>
<p>He has gone their way early, Roger said in a throttle of tears.</p>
<p>Nothing in the memorial of all this. Instead, accomplishments unknown
to us, the accretion of a short, handsome wife and the production of two
tall daughters. They haven’t got him right, Roger grieved as the
tributes went on with their office jokes, mishaps on the tennis court,
charitable contributions, and helping hands for the young.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The Pleiade has lost a star and yet, diminished, it faces another
spring. Roger himself seems to be adorned with fresh innocence as he
watches the begonias and forced gardenias expel the potted
chrysanthemums and Jerusalem cherries from the sidewalk outside the
florist’s. The heavens are clear for a whole week. There is ballet at
the State Theatre and yet another at the opera house. Hardly a night
passes without an author to be recognized and to receive a murmured
approbation, as if a breeze has passed the ear whispering, beloved, here
you are at last.</p>
<p>The pleasing winds came one day, drifted away the next, and came once
more. The dollar bin at The Pleiade now has a two-dollar sign on it.
When the talk turns to unemployment and inflation, Jenny can be heard to
say: There is a lot of money in pockets. The Chinese build a glass
extension for their restaurant and fill it with smart blue chairs and
white tables. In the antique shop a large Art Deco bar of black glass
and chrome humbles the lowly, stripped oak.</p>
<p>So the coming of another spring still finds Roger ruling in the
heavens like Zeus. And his great stars, Kafka, Beckett, Walter Benjamin,
Joyce, Akhmatova, and old men from Japan with their whores in the snow
mountains—all of these shine on and on and on.</p>
