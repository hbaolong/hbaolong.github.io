<h4 id="the-third-and-final-continent">The Third and Final
Continent</h4>
<p>By Jhumpa Lahiri (1999)</p>
<p>I left India in 1964 with a certificate in commerce and the
equivalent, in those days, of ten dollars to my name. For three weeks I
sailed on the S.S. Roma, an Italian cargo vessel, in a cabin next to the
ship’s engine, across the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, the Mediterranean,
and finally to England. I lived in London, in Finsbury Park, in a house
occupied entirely by penniless Bengali bachelors like myself, at least a
dozen and sometimes more, all struggling to educate and establish
ourselves abroad.</p>
<p>I attended lectures at L.S.E. and worked at the university library to
get by. We lived three or four to a room, shared a single, icy toilet,
and took turns cooking pots of egg curry, which we ate with our hands on
a table covered with newspapers. Apart from our jobs we had few
responsibilities. On weekends we lounged barefoot in drawstring pajamas,
drinking tea and smoking Rothmans, or set out to watch cricket at
Lord’s. Some weekends the house was crammed with still more Bengalis, to
whom we had introduced ourselves at the greengrocer, or on the Tube, and
we made yet more egg curry, and played Mukesh on a Grundig reel-to-reel,
and soaked our dirty dishes in the bathtub. Every now and then someone
in the house moved out, to live with a woman whom his family back in
Calcutta had determined he was to wed. In 1969, when I was thirty-six
years old, my own marriage was arranged. Around the same time, I was
offered a full-time job in America, in the processing department of a
library at M.I.T. The salary was generous enough to support a wife, and
I was honored to be hired by a world-famous university, and so I
obtained a green card, and prepared to travel farther still.</p>
<p>By then I had enough money to go by plane. I flew first to Calcutta,
to attend my wedding, and a week later to Boston, to begin my new job.
During the flight I read “The Student Guide to North America,” for
although I was no longer a student, I was on a budget all the same. I
learned that Americans drove on the right side of the road, not the
left, and that they called a lift an elevator and an engaged phone busy.
“The pace of life in North America is different from Britain, as you
will soon discover,” the guidebook informed me. “Everybody feels he must
get to the top. Don’t expect an English cup of tea.” As the plane began
its descent over Boston Harbor, the pilot announced the weather and the
time, and that President Nixon had declared a national holiday: two
American men had landed on the moon. Several passengers cheered. “God
bless America!” one of them hollered. Across the aisle, I saw a woman
praying.</p>
<p>I spent my first night at the Y.M.C.A. in Central Square, Cambridge,
an inexpensive accommodation recommended by my guidebook which was
within walking distance of M.I.T. The room contained a cot, a desk, and
a small wooden cross on one wall. A sign on the door said that cooking
was strictly forbidden. A bare window overlooked Massachusetts Avenue.
Car horns, shrill and prolonged, blared one after another. Sirens and
flashing lights heralded endless emergencies, and a succession of buses
rumbled past, their doors opening and closing with a powerful hiss,
throughout the night. The noise was constantly distracting, at times
suffocating. I felt it deep in my ribs, just as I had felt the furious
drone of the engine on the S.S. Roma. But there was no ship’s deck to
escape to, no glittering ocean to thrill my soul, no breeze to cool my
face, no one to talk to. I was too tired to pace the gloomy corridors of
the Y.M.C.A. in my pajamas. Instead I sat at the desk and stared out the
window. In the morning I reported to my job at the Dewey Library, a
beige fortlike building by Memorial Drive. I also opened a bank account,
rented a post-office box, and bought a plastic bowl and a spoon. I went
to a supermarket called Purity Supreme, wandering up and down the
aisles, comparing prices with those in England. In the end I bought a
carton of milk and a box of cornflakes. This was my first meal in
America. Even the simple chore of buying milk was new to me; in London
we’d had bottles delivered each morning to our door.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>In a week I had adjusted, more or less. I ate cornflakes and milk
morning and night, and bought some bananas for variety, slicing them
into the bowl with the edge of my spoon. I left my carton of milk on the
shaded part of the windowsill, as I had seen other residents at the
Y.M.C.A. do. To pass the time in the evenings I read the Boston Globe
downstairs, in a spacious room with stained-glass windows. I read every
article and advertisement, so that I would grow familiar with things,
and when my eyes grew tired I slept. Only I did not sleep well. Each
night I had to keep the window wide open; it was the only source of air
in the stifling room, and the noise was intolerable. I would lie on the
cot with my fingers pressed into my ears, but when I drifted off to
sleep my hands fell away, and the noise of the traffic would wake me up
again. Pigeon feathers drifted onto the windowsill, and one evening,
when I poured milk over my cornflakes, I saw that it had soured.
Nevertheless I resolved to stay at the Y.M.C.A. for six weeks, until my
wife’s passport and green card were ready. Once she arrived I would have
to rent a proper apartment, and from time to time I studied the
classified section of the newspaper, or stopped in at the housing office
at M.I.T. during my lunch break to see what was available. It was in
this manner that I discovered a room for immediate occupancy, in a house
on a quiet street, the listing said, for eight dollars per week. I
dialled the number from a pay telephone, sorting through the coins, with
which I was still unfamiliar, smaller and lighter than shillings,
heavier and brighter than paisas.</p>
<p>“Who is speaking?” a woman demanded. Her voice was bold and
clamorous.</p>
<p>“Yes, good afternoon, Madam. I am calling about the room for
rent.”</p>
<p>“Harvard or Tech?”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>
<p>“Are you from Harvard or Tech?”</p>
<p>Gathering that Tech referred to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, I replied, “I work at Dewey Library,” adding tentatively,
“at Tech.”</p>
<p>“I only rent rooms to boys from Harvard or Tech!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>I was given an address and an appointment for seven o’clock that
evening. Thirty minutes before the hour I set out, my guidebook in my
pocket, my breath fresh with Listerine. I turned down a street shaded
with trees, perpendicular to Massachusetts Avenue. In spite of the heat
I wore a coat and tie, regarding the event as I would any other
interview; I had never lived in the home of a person who was not Indian.
The house, surrounded by a chain-link fence, was off-white with
dark-brown trim, with a tangle of forsythia bushes plastered against its
front and sides. When I pressed the bell, the woman with whom I had
spoken on the phone hollered from what seemed to be just the other side
of the door, “One minute, please!”</p>
<p>Several minutes later the door was opened by a tiny, extremely old
woman. A mass of snowy hair was arranged like a small sack on top of her
head. As I stepped into the house she sat down on a wooden bench
positioned at the bottom of a narrow carpeted staircase. Once she was
settled on the bench, in a small pool of light, she peered up at me,
giving me her undivided attention. She wore a long black skirt that
spread like a stiff tent to the floor, and a starched white shirt edged
with ruffles at the throat and cuffs. Her hands, folded together in her
lap, had long pallid fingers, with swollen knuckles and tough yellow
nails. Age had battered her features so that she almost resembled a man,
with sharp, shrunken eyes and prominent creases on either side of her
nose. Her lips, chapped and faded, had nearly disappeared, and her
eyebrows were missing altogether. Nevertheless she looked fierce.</p>
<p>“Lock up!” she commanded. She shouted even though I stood only a few
feet away. “Fasten the chain and firmly press that button on the knob!
This is the first thing you shall do when you enter, is that clear?”</p>
<p>I locked the door as directed and examined the house. Next to the
bench was a small round table, its legs fully concealed, much like the
woman’s, by a skirt of lace. The table held a lamp, a transistor radio,
a leather change purse with a silver clasp, and a telephone. A thick
wooden cane was propped against one side. There was a parlor to my
right, lined with bookcases and filled with shabby claw-footed
furniture. In the corner of the parlor I saw a grand piano with its top
down, piled with papers. The piano’s bench was missing; it seemed to be
the one on which the woman was sitting. Somewhere in the house a clock
chimed seven times.</p>
<p>“You’re punctual!” the woman proclaimed. “I expect you shall be so
with the rent!”</p>
<p>“I have a letter, Madam.” In my jacket pocket was a letter from
M.I.T. confirming my employment, which I had brought along to prove that
I was indeed from Tech.</p>
<p>She stared at the letter, then handed it back to me carefully,
gripping it with her fingers as if it were a plate heaped with food. She
did not wear glasses, and I wondered if she’d read a word of it. “The
last boy was always late! Still owes me eight dollars! Harvard boys
aren’t what they used to be! Only Harvard and Tech in this house! How’s
Tech, boy?”</p>
<p>“It is very well.”</p>
<p>“You checked the lock?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>She unclasped her fingers, slapped the space beside her on the bench
with one hand, and told me to sit down. For a moment she was silent.
Then she intoned, as if she alone possessed this knowledge:</p>
<p>“There is an American flag on the moon!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.” Until then I had not thought very much about the moon
shot. It was in the newspaper, of course, article upon article. The
astronauts had landed on the shores of the Sea of Tranquillity, I had
read, travelling farther than anyone in the history of civilization. For
a few hours they explored the moon’s surface. They gathered rocks in
their pockets, described their surroundings (a magnificent desolation,
according to one astronaut), spoke by phone to the President, and
planted a flag in lunar soil. The voyage was hailed as man’s most
awesome achievement.</p>
<p>The woman bellowed, “A flag on the moon, boy! I heard it on the
radio! Isn’t that splendid?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>But she was not satisfied with my reply. Instead she commanded, “Say
‘Splendid!’ ”</p>
<p>I was both baffled and somewhat insulted by the request. It reminded
me of the way I was taught multiplication tables as a child, repeating
after the master, sitting cross-legged on the floor of my one-room
Tollygunge school. It also reminded me of my wedding, when I had
repeated endless Sanskrit verses after the priest, verses I barely
understood, which joined me to my wife. I said nothing.</p>
<p>“Say ‘Splendid!’ ” the woman bellowed once again.</p>
<p>“Splendid,” I murmured. I had to repeat the word a second time at the
top of my lungs, so she could hear. I was reluctant to raise my voice to
an elderly woman, but she did not appear to be offended. If anything the
reply pleased her, because her next command was:</p>
<p>“Go see the room!”</p>
<p>I rose from the bench and mounted the narrow staircase. There were
five doors, two on either side of an equally narrow hallway, and one at
the opposite end. Only one door was open. The room contained a twin bed
under a sloping ceiling, a brown oval rug, a basin with an exposed pipe,
and a chest of drawers. One door led to a closet, another to a toilet
and a tub. The window was open; net curtains stirred in the breeze. I
lifted them away and inspected the view: a small back yard, with a few
fruit trees and an empty clothesline. I was satisfied.</p>
<p>When I returned to the foyer the woman picked up the leather change
purse on the table, opened the clasp, fished about with her fingers, and
produced a key on a thin wire hoop. She informed me that there was a
kitchen at the back of the house, accessible through the parlor. I was
welcome to use the stove as long as I left it as I found it. Sheets and
towels were provided, but keeping them clean was my own responsibility.
The rent was due Friday mornings on the ledge above the piano keys. “And
no lady visitors!”</p>
<p>“I am a married man, Madam.” It was the first time I had announced
this fact to anyone.</p>
<p>But she had not heard. “No lady visitors!” she insisted. She
introduced herself as Mrs. Croft.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>My wife’s name was Mala. The marriage had been arranged by my older
brother and his wife. I regarded the proposition with neither objection
nor enthusiasm. It was a duty expected of me, as it was expected of
every man. She was the daughter of a schoolteacher in Beleghata. I was
told that she could cook, knit, embroider, sketch landscapes, and recite
poems by Tagore, but these talents could not make up for the fact that
she did not possess a fair complexion, and so a string of men had
rejected her to her face. She was twenty-seven, an age when her parents
had begun to fear that she would never marry, and so they were willing
to ship their only child halfway across the world in order to save her
from spinsterhood.</p>
<p>For five nights we shared a bed. Each of those nights, after applying
cold cream and braiding her hair, she turned from me and wept; she
missed her parents. Although I would be leaving the country in a few
days, custom dictated that she was now a part of my household, and for
the next six weeks she was to live with my brother and his wife,
cooking, cleaning, serving tea and sweets to guests. I did nothing to
console her. I lay on my own side of the bed, reading my guidebook by
flashlight. At times I thought of the tiny room on the other side of the
wall which had belonged to my mother. Now the room was practically
empty; the wooden pallet on which she’d once slept was piled with trunks
and old bedding. Nearly six years ago, before leaving for London, I had
watched her die on that bed, had found her playing with her excrement in
her final days. Before we cremated her I had cleaned each of her
fingernails with a hairpin, and then, because my brother could not bear
it, I had assumed the role of eldest son, and had touched the flame to
her temple, to release her tormented soul to heaven.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>The next morning I moved into Mrs. Croft’s house. When I unlocked the
door I saw that she was sitting on the piano bench, on the same side as
the previous evening. She wore the same black skirt, the same starched
white blouse, and had her hands folded together the same way in her lap.
She looked so much the same that I wondered if she’d spent the whole
night on the bench. I put my suitcase upstairs and then headed off to
work. That evening when I came home from the university, she was still
there.</p>
<p>“Sit down, boy!” She slapped the space beside her.</p>
<p>I perched on the bench. I had a bag of groceries with me—more milk,
more cornflakes, and more bananas, for my inspection of the kitchen
earlier in the day had revealed no spare pots or pans. There were only
two saucepans in the refrigerator, both containing some orange broth,
and a copper kettle on the stove.</p>
<p>“Good evening, Madam.”</p>
<p>She asked me if I had checked the lock. I told her I had.</p>
<p>For a moment she was silent. Then suddenly she declared, with the
equal measures of disbelief and delight as the night before, “There’s an
American flag on the moon, boy!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>“A flag on the moon! Isn’t that splendid?”</p>
<p>I nodded, dreading what I knew was coming. “Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>“Say ‘Splendid!’ ”</p>
<p>This time I paused, looking to either side in case anyone was there
to overhear me, though I knew perfectly well that the house was empty. I
felt like an idiot. But it was a small enough thing to ask. “Splendid!”
I cried out.</p>
<p>Within days it became our routine. In the mornings when I left for
the library Mrs. Croft was either hidden away in her bedroom, on the
other side of the staircase, or sitting on the bench, oblivious of my
presence, listening to the news or classical music on the radio. But
each evening when I returned the same thing happened: she slapped the
bench, ordered me to sit down, declared that there was a flag on the
moon, and declared that it was splendid. I said it was splendid, too,
and then we sat in silence. As awkward as it was, and as endless as it
felt to me then, the nightly encounter lasted only about ten minutes;
inevitably she would drift off to sleep, her head falling abruptly
toward her chest, leaving me free to retire to my room. By then, of
course, there was no flag standing on the moon. The astronauts, I read
in the paper, had seen it fall before they flew back to Earth. But I did
not have the heart to tell her.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Friday morning, when my first week’s rent was due, I went to the
piano in the parlor to place my money on the ledge. The piano keys were
dull and discolored. When I pressed one, it made no sound at all. I had
put eight dollar bills in an envelope and written Mrs. Croft’s name on
the front of it. I was not in the habit of leaving money unmarked and
unattended. From where I stood I could see the profile of her
tent-shaped skirt in the hall. It seemed unnecessary to make her get up
and walk all the way to the piano. I never saw her walking about, and
assumed, from the cane propped against the round table, that she did so
with difficulty. When I approached the bench she peered up at me and
demanded:</p>
<p>“What is your business?”</p>
<p>“The rent, Madam.”</p>
<p>“On the ledge above the piano keys!”</p>
<p>“I have it here.” I extended the envelope toward her, but her
fingers, folded together in her lap, did not budge. I bowed slightly and
lowered the envelope, so that it hovered just above her hands. After a
moment she accepted it, and nodded her head.</p>
<p>That night when I came home, she did not slap the bench, but out of
habit I sat beside her as usual. She asked me if I had checked the lock,
but she mentioned nothing about the flag on the moon. Instead she
said:</p>
<p>“It was very kind of you!”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, Madam?”</p>
<p>“Very kind of you!”</p>
<p>She was still holding the envelope in her hands.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>On Sunday there was a knock on my door. An elderly woman introduced
herself: she was Mrs. Croft’s daughter, Helen. She walked into the room
and looked at each of the walls as if for signs of change, glancing at
the shirts that hung in the closet, the neckties draped over the
doorknob, the box of cornflakes on the chest of drawers, the dirty bowl
and spoon in the basin. She was short and thick-waisted, with cropped
silver hair and bright pink lipstick. She wore a sleeveless summer
dress, a necklace of white plastic beads, and spectacles on a chain that
hung like a swing against her chest. The backs of her legs were mapped
with dark-blue veins, and her upper arms sagged like the flesh of a
roasted eggplant. She told me she lived in Arlington, a town farther up
Massachusetts Avenue. “I come once a week to bring Mother groceries. Has
she sent you packing yet?”</p>
<p>“It is very well, Madam.”</p>
<p>“Some of the boys run screaming. But I think she likes you. You’re
the first boarder she’s ever referred to as a gentleman.”</p>
<p>She looked at me, noticing my bare feet. (I still felt strange
wearing shoes indoors, and always removed them before entering my room.)
“Are you new to Boston?”</p>
<p>“New to America, Madam.”</p>
<p>“From?” She raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“I am from Calcutta, India.”</p>
<p>“Is that right? We had a Brazilian fellow, about a year ago. You’ll
find Cambridge a very international city.”</p>
<p>I nodded, and began to wonder how long our conversation would last.
But at that moment we heard Mrs. Croft’s electrifying voice rising up
the stairs.</p>
<p>“You are to come downstairs immediately!”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Helen cried back.</p>
<p>“Immediately!”</p>
<p>I put on my shoes. Helen sighed.</p>
<p>I followed Helen down the staircase.</p>
<p>She seemed to be in no hurry, and complained at one point that she
had a bad knee. “Have you been walking without your cane?” Helen called
out. “You know you’re not supposed to walk without that cane.” She
paused, resting her hand on the bannister, and looked back at me. “She
slips sometimes.”</p>
<p>For the first time Mrs. Croft seemed vulnerable. I pictured her on
the floor in front of the bench, flat on her back, staring at the
ceiling, her feet pointing in opposite directions. But when we reached
the bottom of the staircase she was sitting there as usual, her hands
folded together in her lap. Two grocery bags were at her feet. She did
not slap the bench, or ask us to sit down. She glared.</p>
<p>“What is it, Mother?”</p>
<p>“It’s improper!”</p>
<p>“What’s improper?”</p>
<p>“It is improper for a lady and gentleman who are not married to one
another to hold a private conversation without a chaperone!”</p>
<p>Helen said she was sixty-eight years old, old enough to be my mother,
but Mrs. Croft insisted that Helen and I speak to each other downstairs,
in the parlor. She added that it was also improper for a lady of Helen’s
station to reveal her age, and to wear a dress so high above the
ankle.</p>
<p>“For your information, Mother, it’s 1969. What would you do if you
actually left the house one day and saw a girl in a miniskirt?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Croft sniffed. “I’d have her arrested.”</p>
<p>Helen shook her head and picked up one of the grocery bags. I picked
up the other one, and followed her through the parlor and into the
kitchen. The bags were filled with cans of soup, which Helen opened up
one by one with a few cranks of a can opener. She tossed the old soup
into the sink, rinsed the saucepans under the tap, filled them with soup
from the newly opened cans, and put them back in the refrigerator. “A
few years ago she could still open the cans herself,” Helen said. “She
hates that I do it for her now. But the piano killed her hands.” She put
on her spectacles, glanced at the cupboards, and spotted my tea bags.
“Shall we have a cup?”</p>
<p>I filled the kettle on the stove. “I beg your pardon, Madam. The
piano?”</p>
<p>“She used to give lessons. For forty years. It was how she raised us
after my father died.” Helen put her hands on her hips, staring at the
open refrigerator. She reached into the back, pulled out a wrapped stick
of butter, frowned, and tossed it into the garbage. “That ought to do
it,” she said, and put the unopened cans of soup in the cupboard. I sat
at the table and watched as Helen washed the dirty dishes, tied up the
garbage bag, and poured boiling water into two cups. She handed one to
me without milk, and sat down at the table.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Madam, but is it enough?”</p>
<p>Helen took a sip of her tea. Her lipstick left a smiling pink stain
on the rim of the cup. “Is what enough?”</p>
<p>“The soup in the pans. Is it enough food for Mrs. Croft?”</p>
<p>“She won’t eat anything else. She stopped eating solids after she
turned one hundred. That was, let’s see, three years ago.”</p>
<p>I was mortified. I had assumed Mrs. Croft was in her eighties,
perhaps as old as ninety. I had never known a person who had lived for
over a century. That this person was a widow who lived alone mortified
me further still. Widowhood had driven my own mother insane. My father,
who worked as a clerk at the General Post Office of Calcutta, died of
encephalitis when I was sixteen. My mother refused to adjust to life
without him; instead she sank deeper into a world of darkness from which
neither I, nor my brother, nor concerned relatives, nor psychiatric
clinics on Rash Behari Avenue could save her. What pained me most was to
see her so unguarded, to hear her burp after meals or expel gas in front
of company without the slightest embarrassment. After my father’s death
my brother abandoned his schooling and began to work in the jute mill he
would eventually manage, in order to keep the household running. And so
it was my job to sit by my mother’s feet and study for my exams as she
counted and recounted the bracelets on her arm as if they were the beads
of an abacus. We tried to keep an eye on her. Once she had wandered half
naked to the tram depot before we were able to bring her inside
again.</p>
<p>“I am happy to warm Mrs. Croft’s soup in the evenings,” I suggested.
“It is no trouble.”</p>
<p>Helen looked at her watch, stood up, and poured the rest of her tea
into the sink. “I wouldn’t if I were you. That’s the sort of thing that
would kill her altogether.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>That evening, when Helen had gone and Mrs. Croft and I were alone
again, I began to worry. Now that I knew how very old she was, I worried
that something would happen to her in the middle of the night, or when I
was out during the day. As vigorous as her voice was, and imperious as
she seemed, I knew that even a scratch or a cough could kill a person
that old; each day she lived, I knew, was something of a miracle. Helen
didn’t seem concerned. She came and went, bringing soup for Mrs. Croft,
one Sunday after the next.</p>
<p>In this manner the six weeks of that summer passed. I came home each
evening, after my hours at the library, and spent a few minutes on the
piano bench with Mrs. Croft. Some evenings I sat beside her long after
she had drifted off to sleep, still in awe of how many years she had
spent on this earth. At times I tried to picture the world she had been
born into, in 1866—a world, I imagined, filled with women in long black
skirts, and chaste conversations in the parlor. Now, when I looked at
her hands with their swollen knuckles folded together in her lap, I
imagined them smooth and slim, striking the piano keys. At times I came
downstairs before going to sleep, to make sure she was sitting upright
on the bench, or was safe in her bedroom. On Fridays I put the rent in
her hands. There was nothing I could do for her beyond these simple
gestures. I was not her son, and, apart from those eight dollars, I owed
her nothing.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>At the end of August, Mala’s passport and green card were ready. I
received a telegram with her flight information; my brother’s house in
Calcutta had no telephone. Around that time I also received a letter
from her, written only a few days after we had parted. There was no
salutation; addressing me by name would have assumed an intimacy we had
not yet discovered. It contained only a few lines. “I write in English
in preparation for the journey. Here I am very much lonely. Is it very
cold there. Is there snow. Yours, Mala.”</p>
<p>I was not touched by her words. We had spent only a handful of days
in each other’s company. And yet we were bound together; for six weeks
she had worn an iron bangle on her wrist, and applied vermillion powder
to the part in her hair, to signify to the world that she was a bride.
In those six weeks I regarded her arrival as I would the arrival of a
coming month, or season—something inevitable, but meaningless at the
time. So little did I know her that, while details of her face sometimes
rose to my memory, I could not conjure up the whole of it.</p>
<p>A few days after receiving the letter, as I was walking to work in
the morning, I saw an Indian woman on Massachusetts Avenue, wearing a
sari with its free end nearly dragging on the footpath, and pushing a
child in a stroller. An American woman with a small black dog on a leash
was walking to one side of her. Suddenly the dog began barking. I
watched as the Indian woman, startled, stopped in her path, at which
point the dog leaped up and seized the end of the sari between its
teeth. The American woman scolded the dog, appeared to apologize, and
walked quickly away, leaving the Indian woman to fix her sari, and quiet
her crying child. She did not see me standing there, and eventually she
continued on her way. Such a mishap, I realized that morning, would soon
be my concern. It was my duty to take care of Mala, to welcome her and
protect her. I would have to buy her her first pair of snow boots, her
first winter coat. I would have to tell her which streets to avoid,
which way the traffic came, tell her to wear her sari so that the free
end did not drag on the footpath. A five-mile separation from her
parents, I recalled with some irritation, had caused her to weep.</p>
<p>Unlike Mala, I was used to it all by then: used to cornflakes and
milk, used to Helen’s visits, used to sitting on the bench with
Mrs. Croft. The only thing I was not used to was Mala. Nevertheless I
did what I had to do. I went to the housing office at M.I.T. and found a
furnished apartment a few blocks away, with a double bed and a private
kitchen and bath, for forty dollars a week. One last Friday I handed
Mrs. Croft eight dollar bills in an envelope, brought my suitcase
downstairs, and informed her that I was moving. She put my key into her
change purse. The last thing she asked me to do was hand her the cane
propped against the table, so that she could walk to the door and lock
it behind me. “Goodbye, then,” she said, and retreated back into the
house. I did not expect any display of emotion, but I was disappointed
all the same. I was only a boarder, a man who paid her a bit of money
and passed in and out of her home for six weeks. Compared with a
century, it was no time at all.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>At the airport I recognized Mala immediately. The free end of her
sari did not drag on the floor, but was draped in a sign of bridal
modesty over her head, just as it had draped my mother until the day my
father died. Her thin brown arms were stacked with gold bracelets, a
small red circle was painted on her forehead, and the edges of her feet
were tinted with a decorative red dye. I did not embrace her, or kiss
her, or take her hand. Instead I asked her, speaking Bengali for the
first time in America, if she was hungry.</p>
<p>She hesitated, then nodded yes.</p>
<p>I told her I had prepared some egg curry at home. “What did they give
you to eat on the plane?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t eat.”</p>
<p>“All the way from Calcutta?”</p>
<p>“The menu said oxtail soup.”</p>
<p>“But surely there were other items.”</p>
<p>“The thought of eating an ox’s tail made me lose my appetite.”</p>
<p>When we arrived home, Mala opened up one of her suitcases, and
presented me with two pullover sweaters, both made with bright-blue
wool, which she had knitted in the course of our separation, one with a
V neck, the other covered with cables. I tried them on; both were tight
under the arms. She had also brought me two new pairs of drawstring
pajamas, a letter from my brother, and a packet of loose Darjeeling tea.
I had no present for her apart from the egg curry. We sat at a bare
table, staring at our plates. We ate with our hands, another thing I had
not yet done in America.</p>
<p>“The house is nice,” she said. “Also the egg curry.” With her left
hand she held the end of her sari to her chest, so it would not slip off
her head.</p>
<p>“I don’t know many recipes.”</p>
<p>She nodded, peeling the skin off each of her potatoes before eating
them. At one point the sari slipped to her shoulders. She readjusted it
at once.</p>
<p>“There is no need to cover your head,” I said. “I don’t mind. It
doesn’t matter here.”</p>
<p>She kept it covered anyway.</p>
<p>I waited to get used to her, to her presence at my side, at my table
and in my bed, but a week later we were still strangers. I still was not
used to coming home to an apartment that smelled of steamed rice, and
finding that the basin in the bathroom was always wiped clean, our two
toothbrushes lying side by side, a cake of Pears soap residing in the
soap dish. I was not used to the fragrance of the coconut oil she rubbed
every other night into her scalp, or the delicate sound her bracelets
made as she moved about the apartment. In the mornings she was always
awake before I was. The first morning when I came into the kitchen she
had heated up the leftovers and set a plate with a spoonful of salt on
its edge, assuming I would eat rice for breakfast, as most Bengali
husbands did. I told her cereal would do, and the next morning when I
came into the kitchen she had already poured the cornflakes into my
bowl. One morning she walked with me to M.I.T., where I gave her a short
tour of the campus. The next morning before I left for work she asked me
for a few dollars. I parted with them reluctantly, but I knew that this,
too, was now normal. When I came home from work there was a potato
peeler in the kitchen drawer, and a tablecloth on the table, and chicken
curry made with fresh garlic and ginger on the stove. After dinner I
read the newspaper, while Mala sat at the kitchen table, working on a
cardigan for herself with more of the blue wool, or writing letters
home.</p>
<p>On Friday, I suggested going out. Mala set down her knitting and
disappeared into the bathroom. When she emerged I regretted the
suggestion; she had put on a silk sari and extra bracelets, and coiled
her hair with a flattering side part on top of her head. She was
prepared as if for a party, or at the very least for the cinema, but I
had no such destination in mind. The evening was balmy. We walked
several blocks down Massachusetts Avenue, looking into the windows of
restaurants and shops. Then, without thinking, I led her down the quiet
street where for so many nights I had walked alone.</p>
<p>“This is where I lived before you came,” I said, stopping at
Mrs. Croft’s chain-link fence.</p>
<p>“In such a big house?”</p>
<p>“I had a small room upstairs. At the back.”</p>
<p>“Who else lives there?”</p>
<p>“A very old woman.”</p>
<p>“With her family?”</p>
<p>“Alone.”</p>
<p>“But who takes care of her?”</p>
<p>I opened the gate. “For the most part she takes care of herself.”</p>
<p>I wondered if Mrs. Croft would remember me; I wondered if she had a
new boarder to sit with her each evening. When I pressed the bell I
expected the same long wait as that day of our first meeting, when I did
not have a key. But this time the door was opened almost immediately, by
Helen. Mrs. Croft was not sitting on the bench. The bench was gone.</p>
<p>“Hello there,” Helen said, smiling with her bright pink lips at Mala.
“Mother’s in the parlor. Will you be visiting awhile?”</p>
<p>“As you wish, Madam.”</p>
<p>“Then I think I’ll run to the store, if you don’t mind. She had a
little accident. We can’t leave her alone these days, not even for a
minute.”</p>
<p>I locked the door after Helen and walked into the parlor. Mrs. Croft
was lying flat on her back, her head on a peach-colored cushion, a thin
white quilt spread over her body. Her hands were folded together on her
chest. When she saw me she pointed at the sofa, and told me to sit down.
I took my place as directed, but Mala wandered over to the piano and sat
on the bench, which was now positioned where it belonged.</p>
<p>“I broke my hip!” Mrs. Croft announced, as if no time had passed.</p>
<p>“Oh dear, Madam.”</p>
<p>“I fell off the bench!”</p>
<p>“I am so sorry, Madam.”</p>
<p>“It was the middle of the night! Do you know what I did, boy?”</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>“I called the police!”</p>
<p>She stared up at the ceiling and grinned sedately, exposing a crowded
row of long gray teeth. “What do you say to that, boy?”</p>
<p>As stunned as I was, I knew what I had to say. With no hesitation at
all, I cried out, “Splendid!”</p>
<p>Mala laughed then. Her voice was full of kindness, her eyes bright
with amusement. I had never heard her laugh before, and it was loud
enough so that Mrs. Croft heard, too. She turned to Mala and glared.</p>
<p>“Who is she, boy?”</p>
<p>“She is my wife, Madam.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Croft pressed her head at an angle against the cushion to get a
better look. “Can you play the piano?”</p>
<p>“No, Madam,” Mala replied.</p>
<p>“Then stand up!”</p>
<p>Mala rose to her feet, adjusting the end of her sari over her head
and holding it to her chest, and, for the first time since her arrival,
I felt sympathy. I remembered my first days in London, learning how to
take the Tube to Russell Square, riding an escalator for the first time,
unable to understand that when the man cried “piper” it meant “paper,”
unable to decipher, for a whole year, that the conductor said “Mind the
gap” as the train pulled away from each station. Like me, Mala had
travelled far from home, not knowing where she was going, or what she
would find, for no reason other than to be my wife. As strange as it
seemed, I knew in my heart that one day her death would affect me, and
stranger still, that mine would affect her. I wanted somehow to explain
this to Mrs. Croft, who was still scrutinizing Mala from top to toe with
what seemed to be placid disdain. I wondered if Mrs. Croft had ever seen
a woman in a sari, with a dot painted on her forehead and bracelets
stacked on her wrists. I wondered what she would object to. I wondered
if she could see the red dye still vivid on Mala’s feet, all but
obscured by the bottom edge of her sari. At last Mrs. Croft declared,
with the equal measures of disbelief and delight I knew well:</p>
<p>“She is a perfect lady!”</p>
<p>Now it was I who laughed. I did so quietly, and Mrs. Croft did not
hear me. But Mala had heard, and, for the first time, we looked at each
other and smiled.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>I like to think of that moment in Mrs. Croft’s parlor as the moment
when the distance between Mala and me began to lessen. Although we were
not yet fully in love, I like to think of the months that followed as a
honeymoon of sorts. Together we explored the city and met other
Bengalis, some of whom are still friends today. We discovered that a man
named Bill sold fresh fish on Prospect Street, and that a shop in
Harvard Square called Cardullo’s sold bay leaves and cloves. In the
evenings we walked to the Charles River to watch sailboats drift across
the water, or had ice-cream cones in Harvard Yard. We bought a camera
with which to document our life together, and I took pictures of her
posing in front of the Prudential Building, so that she could send them
to her parents. At night we kissed, shy at first but quickly bold, and
discovered pleasure and solace in each other’s arms. I told her about my
voyage on the S.S. Roma, and about Finsbury Park and the Y.M.C.A., and
my evenings on the bench with Mrs. Croft. When I told her stories about
my mother, she wept. It was Mala who consoled me when, reading the Globe
one evening, I came across Mrs. Croft’s obituary. I had not thought of
her in several months—by then those six weeks of the summer were already
a remote interlude in my past—but when I learned of her death I was
stricken, so much so that when Mala looked up from her knitting she
found me staring at the wall, unable to speak. Mrs. Croft’s was the
first death I mourned in America, for hers was the first life I had
admired; she had left this world at last, ancient and alone, never to
return.</p>
<p>As for me, I have not strayed much farther. Mala and I live in a town
about twenty miles from Boston, on a tree-lined street much like
Mrs. Croft’s, in a house we own, with room for guests, and a garden that
saves us from buying tomatoes in summer. We are American citizens now,
so that we can collect Social Security when it is time. Though we visit
Calcutta every few years, we have decided to grow old here. I work in a
small college library. We have a son who attends Harvard University.
Mala no longer drapes the end of her sari over her head, or weeps at
night for her parents, but occasionally she weeps for our son. So we
drive to Cambridge to visit him, or bring him home for a weekend, so
that he can eat rice with us with his hands, and speak in Bengali,
things we sometimes worry he will no longer do after we die.</p>
<p>Whenever we make that drive, I always take Massachusetts Avenue, in
spite of the traffic. I barely recognize the buildings now, but each
time I am there I return instantly to those six weeks as if they were
only the other day, and I slow down and point to Mrs. Croft’s street,
saying to my son, Here was my first home in America, where I lived with
a woman who was a hundred and three. “Remember?” Mala says, and smiles,
amazed, as I am, that there was ever a time that we were strangers. My
son always expresses his astonishment, not at Mrs. Croft’s age but at
how little I paid in rent, a fact nearly as inconceivable to him as a
flag on the moon was to a woman born in 1866. In my son’s eyes I see the
ambition that had first hurled me across the world. In a few years he
will graduate and pave his own way, alone and unprotected. But I remind
myself that he has a father who is still living, a mother who is happy
and strong. Whenever he is discouraged, I tell him that if I can survive
on three continents, then there is no obstacle he cannot conquer. While
the astronauts, heroes forever, spent mere hours on the moon, I have
remained in this new world for nearly thirty years. I know that my
achievement is quite ordinary. I am not the only man to seek his fortune
far from home, and certainly I am not the first. Still, there are times
I am bewildered by each mile I have travelled, each meal I have eaten,
each person I have known, each room in which I have slept. As ordinary
as it all appears, there are times when it is beyond my imagination.</p>
