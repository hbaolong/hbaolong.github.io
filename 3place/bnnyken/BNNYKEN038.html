<h4 id="how-to-date-a-brown-girl-black-girl-white-girl-or-halfie">How to
Date a Brown Girl (Black Girl, White Girl, or Halfie)</h4>
<p>By Junot Díaz (1995)</p>
<p>Wait until your brother, your sisters, and your mother leave the
apartment. You’ve already told them that you were feeling too sick to go
to Union City to visit that tía who likes to squeeze your nuts. (He’s
gotten big, she’ll say.) And even though your moms knew you weren’t sick
you stuck to your story until finally she said, Go ahead and stay,
malcriado.</p>
<p>Clear the government cheese from the refrigerator. If the girl’s from
the Terrace, stack the boxes in the crisper. If she’s from the Park or
Society Hill, then hide the cheese in the cabinet above the oven, where
she’ll never see it. Leave a reminder under your pillow to get out the
cheese before morning or your moms will kick your ass. Take down any
embarrassing photos of your family in the campo, especially, that one
with the half-naked kids dragging a goat on a rope. Hide the picture of
yourself with an Afro. Make sure the bathroom is presentable. Since your
toilet can’t flush toilet paper, put the bucket with all the crapped-on
toilet paper under the sink. Spray the bucket with Lysol, then close the
lid.</p>
<p>Shower, comb, dress. Sit on the couch and watch TV. If she’s an
outsider her father will bring her, maybe her mother. Her parents won’t
want her seeing a boy from the Terrace—people get stabbed in the
Terrace—but she’s strong-headed and this time will get her way. If she’s
a white girl, you’re sure you’ll at least get a hand job.</p>
<p>The directions you gave her were in your best handwriting, so her
parents won’t think you’re an idiot. Get up from the couch and check the
parking lot. Nothing. If the girl’s local, don’t sweat. She’ll flow over
when she’s good and ready. Sometimes she’ll run into her friends and a
whole crowd will show up, and even though that means you ain’t getting
shit it will be fun anyway and you’ll wish these people would come over
more often. Sometimes the girl won’t flow over at all and the next day
in school she’ll say, Sorry, and smile, and you’ll believe her and be
stupid enough to ask her out again.</p>
<p>You wait, and after an hour you go out to your corner. The
neighborhood is full of traffic—commuters now cut through the
neighborhood—making it hard on the kids and the viejas, who are used to
empty streets. Give one of your friends a shout and when he says, Still
waiting on that bitch? say, Hell, yeah.</p>
<p>Get back inside. Call her house and when her father picks up ask if
she’s there. If he sounds like a principal or a police chief, a dude
with a big neck, someone who never has to watch his back, then hang up.
Sit and wait. And wait. Until finally, just as your stomach is about to
give out on you, a Honda, or maybe a Cherokee, will pull in and out
she’ll come.</p>
<p>Hey, she’ll say.</p>
<p>Come on in, you’ll say.</p>
<p>Look, she’ll say. My mom wants to meet you. She’s got herself all
worried about nothing.</p>
<p>Don’t panic. Say, Hey, no problem. Run a hand through your hair like
the white boys do, even though the only thing that runs easily through
your hair is Africa. She will look good. White girls are the ones you
want most, aren’t they? But the out-of-towners are usually black—black
girls who grew up with ballet and Girl Scouts, and have three cars in
their driveway. If she’s a halfie don’t be surprised that her mother is
the white one. Say, Hi. She’ll say, Hi, and you’ll see that you don’t
scare her, not really. She will say that she needs easier directions to
get out, and even though she already has the best directions on her lap,
give her new ones. Make her happy.</p>
<p>If the girl’s from the Terrace, none of this will happen.</p>
<p>You have choices. If the girl’s from around the way, take her to El
Cibao for dinner. Order everything in your busted-up Spanish. Amaze her
if she’s black, let her correct you if she’s Latina. If she’s not from
around the way, Wendy’s will do. As you walk to the restaurant, talk
about school. A local girl won’t need stories about the neighborhood,
but the others might. Tell her about the pendejo who stored cannisters
of Army tear gas in his basement for years until one day they all
cracked and the neighborhood got a dose of military-strength stuff.
Don’t tell her that your moms knew right away what it was, that she
recognized the smell from the year the United States invaded your
island.</p>
<p>Hope that you don’t run into your nemesis, Howie, the Puerto Rican
kid with the two killer mutts. He walks them all over the neighborhood,
and every now and then the mutts corner a cat and tear it to shreds, as
Howie laughs and the cat flips up in the air, its neck twisted around
like an owl’s, red meat showing through the soft fur. And if his dogs
haven’t cornered a cat, then he’ll be behind you, asking, Is that your
new fuckbuddy?</p>
<p>Let him talk. Howie weighs two hundred pounds and could eat you if he
wanted. But at the field he’ll turn away. He has new sneakers and
doesn’t want them muddy. If the girl’s an outsider, that’s when she’ll
hiss, What a fucking asshole. A homegirl would have been yelling back at
him the whole time, unless she was shy. Either way, don’t feel bad that
you didn’t do anything. Never lose a fight on a first date.</p>
<p>Dinner will be tense. You are not good at talking to people you don’t
know.</p>
<p>A halfie will tell you that her parents met in the Movement. Back
then, she’ll say, people thought it was a radical thing to do. It will
sound like something her parents made her memorize. Your brother heard
that one, too, and said, Sounds like a whole lot of Uncle Tomming to me.
Don’t repeat this.</p>
<p>Put down your hamburger and say, It must have been hard.</p>
<p>It was, she will say.</p>
<p>She’ll appreciate your interest. She’ll tell you more. Black people,
she will say, treat me real bad. That’s why I don’t like them. You’ll
wonder how she feels about Dominicans. Don’t ask. Let her speak on it
and when you’ve finished eating, walk back through the neighborhood. The
skies will be magnificent. Pollutants have made Jersey sunsets one of
the wonders of the world. Point it out. Touch her shoulder and say,
Isn’t that nice?</p>
<p>Get serious. Watch TV, but stay alert. Sip some of the Bermudez your
father left in the cabinet, which nobody touches. She’ll drink enough to
make her brave. A local girl will have hips and a nice ass but won’t be
quick about letting you touch her. She has to live in the same
neighborhood as you do. She might just chill with you and then go home.
She might kiss you and then leave. Or she might, if she’s reckless, give
it up, but that’s rare. Kissing will suffice. A white girl might give it
up right then. Don’t stop her. She’ll take her gum out of her mouth,
stick it to the plastic sofa covers, and then move close to you. You
have nice eyes, she might say.</p>
<p>Tell her that you love her hair, her skin, her lips, because, in
truth, you love them more than you love your own.</p>
<p>She’ll say, I like Spanish guys, and even though you’ve never been to
Spain, say, I like you. You’ll sound smooth.</p>
<p>You’ll be with her until about eight-thirty, and then she’ll want to
wash up. In the bathroom, she’ll hum a song from the radio and her waist
will keep the beat against the lip of the sink. Think of her old lady
coming to get her, and imagine what she would say if she knew that her
daughter had just lain under you and blown your name into your ear.
While she’s in the bathroom, you might call one of your boys and say, Ya
lo hice, cabrón. Or sit back on the couch and smile.</p>
<p>But usually it won’t work this way. Be prepared. She will not want to
kiss you. Just cool it, she’ll say. The halfie might lean back and push
you away. She will cross her arms and say, I hate my tits. Pretend to
watch the TV, and then turn to her to stroke her hair, even though you
know she’ll pull away again. I don’t like anybody to touch my hair, she
will say. She will act like somebody you don’t know. In school, she is
known for her attention-grabbing laugh, high and far-ranging like a
gull’s, but here she will worry you. You will not know what to say.</p>
<p>You’re the only kind of guy who asks me out, she will say. Your
neighbors will start their hyena calls, now that the alcohol is in them.
She will say, You and the black boys.</p>
<p>You want to say, Who do you want to ask you out? But you already
know. Let her button her shirt and comb her hair, the sound of it like a
crackling fire between you. When her father pulls in and beeps, let her
go without too much of a goodbye. She won’t want it. During the next
hour, the phone will ring. You will be tempted to pick it up. Don’t.
Watch the shows you want to watch, without a family around to argue with
you. Don’t go downstairs. Don’t fall asleep. It won’t help. Put the
government cheese back in its place before your moms kills you.</p>
