<h4 id="the-red-girl">The Red Girl</h4>
<p>By Jamaica Kincaid (1983)</p>
<p>I always slammed the gate to our yard behind me when I was up to
something. If I was leaving the house—we lived on the island of
Antigua—the slam was to let my mother know that I had left, so she could
stop worrying about me and put her mind on something else. Then, after a
proper time had passed, I would quietly unlatch the gate, creep back
into the yard, and dive under the house to extract or hide some object
that was forbidden me—usually some object that had come into my
possession through my expert stealing. If I was returning home, I would
reverse this procedure, first being very quiet, checking my things under
the house, making sure that everything was still in place, often adding
a new treasure; then the loud bang of the gate to announce to my mother
that I had only just then returned home. My mother would usually say,
“How many times do I have to tell you not to slam the gate?”</p>
<p>I had under the house almost all the books I had ever read. After
reading a book, whether I liked it or not, I couldn’t bear to part with
it. I would then steal it. I was always successful, because casting
suspicion away from me and putting on an innocent face had become a
specialty of mine. I had a few books that I had received in the usual
straightforward way, for birthdays and Christmas, and as prizes in
school; these were all displayed on a little shelf my father had built
for me, and whenever I felt I was falling out of my mother’s good graces
I would let her see me absorbed in these books. She would come over and
caress my forehead, kiss me, and say, “I know how you like to read, but
you mustn’t strain your eyes.” Feeling the slate wiped clean, I would
then plot something new.</p>
<p>It was my mother who gave me my first marbles. They had come, a pair
of them, as a bonus in a box of oats, and she thought that their unusual
size—they were as big as plums—and their color would amuse me. One was
white with blue, the other white with a brownish yellow. They looked to
me like miniature globes, the white representing the seas, the colors
representing land masses. I didn’t think very much of them as I rolled
them around in my palms, but my mother, taking the brownish-yellow one
in her hand and holding it up in the air, said, “What a nice color!
Amber.” Amber! Needless to say, when I showed the marbles to my friends
at school I said, “Such a nice color, amber,” causing the desired effect
among them, for on hearing me say the word “amber” they widened their
eyes and shaped their mouths into tiny “o”s.</p>
<p>One day, I was throwing stones at the guava tree, trying to knock
down a ripe guava, when the Red Girl came along and said, “Which one do
you want?” After I pointed it out, she climbed up the tree, picked the
one I wanted off its branch, climbed down, and presented it to me. How
my eyes did widen and my mouth form an “o” at this. I had never seen a
girl do this before. All the boys climbed trees for the fruit they
wanted, and all the girls threw stones to knock the fruit off the trees.
But look at the way she climbed that tree: better than any boy.</p>
<p>Polishing off the delicious ripe-to-perfection guava in two bites, I
took a good look at the Red Girl. How right I had been to take some
special notice of her the first time I had seen her. She was holding on
to her mother’s skirt; I was holding on to my mother’s. Our mothers
waved to each other as they passed, calling out the usual greetings,
making the usual inquiries. I noticed that the girl’s hair was the color
of a penny fresh from the mint, and that it was so unruly it had to be
forcibly twisted into corkscrews, the ends tied tightly with white
thread. The corkscrews didn’t lie flat on her head, they stood straight
up, and when she walked they bounced up and down as if they were
something amphibian and alive. Right away to myself I called her the Red
Girl. For as she passed, in my mind’s eye I could see her surrounded by
flames, the house she lived in on fire, and she could not escape. I
rescued her, and after that she followed me around worshipfully and took
with great forbearance any and every abuse I heaped on her. I would have
gone on like that for a while, but my mother tugged at me, claiming my
attention; I heard her say, “Such a nice woman, to keep that girl so
dirty.”</p>
<p>The Red Girl and I stood under the guava tree looking each other up
and down. What a beautiful thing I saw standing before me. Her face was
big and round and red, like a moon—a red moon. She had big, broad, flat
feet, and they were naked to the bare ground; her dress was dirty, the
skirt and blouse tearing away from each other at one side; the red hair
that I had first seen standing up on her head was matted and tangled;
her hands were big and fat, and her fingernails held at least ten
anthills of dirt under them. And on top of that she had such an
unbelievable, wonderful smell, as if she had never taken a bath in her
whole life.</p>
<p>I soon learned this about her: She took a bath only once a week, and
that was only so that she could be admitted to her grandmother’s
presence. She didn’t like to bathe, and her mother didn’t force her. She
changed her dress once a week for the same reason. She preferred to wear
a dress until it just couldn’t be worn anymore. Her mother didn’t mind
that, either. She didn’t like to comb her hair, though on the first day
of school she could put herself out for that. She didn’t like to go to
Sunday school, and her mother didn’t force her. She didn’t like to brush
her teeth, but occasionally her mother said it was necessary. She loved
to play marbles, and was so good that only Skerritt boys now played
against her. Oh, what an angel she was, and what a heaven she lived in!
I, on the other hand, took a full bath every morning and a sponge bath
every night. I could hardly go out on my doorstep without putting my
shoes on. I was not allowed to play in the sun without a hat on my head.
My mother paid a woman who lived five houses away from us sevenpence a
week—a penny for each school day and two pence for Sunday—to comb my
hair. On Saturday, my mother washed my hair. Before I went to sleep at
night, I had to make sure my uniform was clean and creaseless and all
laid out for the next day. I had to make sure that my shoes were clean
and polished to a nice shine. I went to Sunday school every Sunday
unless I was sick. I was not allowed to play marbles, and, as for
Skerritt boys, that was hardly mentionable.</p>
<p>By the time the Red Girl and I had told each other all this, we had
walked to the top of the hill behind my house. At the top of the hill
was an old lighthouse. It must have been a useful lighthouse at one
time, but now it was just there for mothers to say to their children,
“Don’t play at the lighthouse,” my own mother leading the chorus, I am
sure. Whenever I did go to the lighthouse behind my mother’s back, I
would have to gather up all my courage to go to the top, the height made
me so dizzy. But now I marched boldly up behind the Red Girl as if at
the top were my own room, with all my familiar comforts waiting for me.
At the top, we stood on the balcony and looked out toward the sea. We
could see some boats coming and going; we could see some children our
own age coming home from games; we could see some sheep being driven
home from pasture; we could see my father coming home from work.</p>
<p>It went without saying between us that my mother should never know
that we had become friends, that we planned to meet at the lighthouse in
this way every day for the rest of our lives and beyond, that I now
worshipped the ground her unwashed feet walked on. Just before we
parted, she gave me three marbles; they were an ordinary kind, the kind
you could buy three for a penny—glass orbs with a tear-shaped drop
suspended in the center. Another secret to keep from my mother!</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>And now I started a new series of betrayals of people and things I
would have sworn only minutes before to die for. There was Gweneth, whom
I loved so, and who was my dearest friend in spite of the fact that she
met with my mother’s complete approval, but she had such slyness and so
many pleasing, to me, ways that my mother could never have imagined.
There she was, waiting for me in our usual spot behind the cistern. “Oh,
Gwen, wait until I tell you this,” I would begin after we had embraced
and exchanged kisses. We would then bring each other up to date on all
our latest triumphs and disappointments. But now, as my head rested on
her shoulder, I thought how dull was the fresh pressedness of her
uniform, the cleanness of her neck, the neatness of her just combed
plaits. We walked into our classroom in the usual way, arm in arm—her
head on my shoulder, since I was the taller—identical smiles on our
faces. The Little Lovebirds, our friends called us. Who could have
guessed that I no longer felt the same? Certainly not Gwen. For, of
course, in bringing her up to date I never mentioned the Red Girl.</p>
<p>As for the marbles! Quite by accident, in a moment when I was just
fooling about, I discovered that I had a talent for playing marbles. I
played a game and I won. I played another game and I won. I took winning
for a sign of the perfection of my new union with the Red Girl. I
devoted my spare time to playing and winning marbles. No longer could I
head a side for a game of rounders; no longer could I, during a break
for recess, walk over from our schoolyard into the neighboring
churchyard to sit on tombstones and gather important information from
the other girls on what exactly it was I should do to make my breasts
begin growing. We were at that moment in the stage where we regarded our
breasts as treasured shrubs, needing only the proper combination of
water and sunlight to make them delicately sprout. All my free time was
devoted to games of marbles. And how I won! From the day I went to
school with the three gifts from the Red Girl and came home that same
day with twenty—enough to fill an old one-pound tin. Everyone attributed
my talent to my long arms and my steady gaze. What a surprise it was to
me—something about myself I had not known. Perhaps it had stuck in my
mind that once my mother said to me, “I am so glad you are not one of
those girls who like to play marbles.” I soon had so many marbles that I
had to store them in old containers, hiding them under the house in
places where they would not be readily visible if my mother should just
one day stoop down and make a sweeping search with her ever-inquisitive,
ever-sharp eyes. If I had not yet come up with the trick of slamming the
gate, I would surely have come up with it now. Sometimes I slammed the
gate so hard that even I began to be afraid it would come off its
hinges.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>At first, the Red Girl and I met every day. Every day after I
finished my chores, each chore being a small rehearsal for that faraway
day, thank God, when I would be the mistress of my own house, that
faraway day when I would have to abandon Gwen, the Red Girl, meetings
behind cistern and at lighthouse, marbles, places under the house, and
every other secret pleasure. I would say to my mother, “I think I will
just go and stretch my legs a bit.” It didn’t take her very long to
wonder why, after all my daily activities, I should suddenly have an
urge to stretch my legs. She said to me, “Why, after all the things you
do every day, the sudden urge to have your legs stretched?” I had always
been extremely lazy, enjoying nothing so much as lying under the house,
my legs sticking out to catch the hot sun, reading one of my stolen
books or just toying with another stolen treasure. After my mother said
this, I stopped going to the lighthouse for a few days, and I worried
about how to explain this interference to the Red Girl. How convenient
for me it would be, I thought, to have a mother to whom I was not a
prime interest. But I found a new tack. A few days later, I told my
mother that for my drawing class I had been asked to observe a field at
sunset, so that in class I could reproduce it in watercolors; would it
be all right, then, if I just went for a small walk up and over the
hill? The question was framed in just the way it would appeal to her, so
eager was she to contribute to my scholarship. Of course she agreed. My
feet must have had wings; in minutes, I was at the top of the
lighthouse.</p>
<p>All the time I had been kept prisoner by the watchful gaze of my
mother, the Red Girl had faithfully gone to our meeting place every day.
Every day, she went and waited for me, and every day I failed to show
up. What could I say to her now? “My mother, the Nosy Parker, would kill
me—or, worse, not speak to me for at least a few hours—if she knew that
I met you in a secret place,” I said. For a while after that, we said
nothing, only staring out to sea, watching the boats coming and going,
watching the children our own age coming home from games, watching the
sheep being driven home from pasture. Then, still without saying a word,
the Red Girl began to pinch me. She pinched hard, picking up pieces of
my almost nonexistent flesh and twisting it around. At first, I vowed
not to cry, but it went on for so long that tears I could not control
streamed down my face. I cried so much that my small chest began to
heave, and then, as if my heaving chest caused her to have some pity on
me, she stopped pinching and began to kiss me on the same spots where
shortly before I felt the pain of her pinch. Oh, the sensation was
delicious—the combination of pinches and kisses. And so wonderful we
found it that, almost every time we met, pinching by her, followed by
tears from me, followed by kisses from her were the order of the day. I
stopped wondering why all the girls whom I had mistreated and abandoned
followed me around with looks of love and adoration on their faces.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>I now quite regularly had to observe a field or something for drawing
class; collect specimens of leaves, flowers, or whole plants for botany
class; gather specimens of rocks for geology class. In other words, my
untruthfulness apparatus was now in full gear. My mother, keeping the
usual close tabs, marvelled at my industriousness and ambition. I was
already first in my class, and I was first without ever really trying
hard, so I had nothing much to worry about. I was such a good liar that,
almost as if to prove all too true my mother’s saying “Where there’s a
liar, there’s a thief,” I began to steal. But how could I not? I had no
money of my own. And what a pleasure it was to bring a gift and see that
red face, on receiving it, grow even redder in the light of the setting
sun on the balcony at the top of the lighthouse. Reaching into my
mother’s purse for the odd penny or so was easy enough to do, I had had
so much practice at it. But that wasn’t enough to buy two yards of
multicolored grosgrain ribbon, or a pair of ring combs studded with
rhinestones, or a pair of artificial rosebuds suitable for wearing at
the waist of a nice dress. I hardly asked myself what use the Red Girl
could really have for these gifts; I hardly cared that she only glanced
at them for a moment and then placed them in a pocket of her dirty
dress. I simply loved giving her things. But where did I get the money
for them? I knew where my parents stored a key to a safe in which they
kept what was to me a lot of money. It wasn’t long before I could get
the key, unlock the safe, and remove some money, and I am sure I could
have done this blindfolded. If they missed it, they must have chalked it
up to a mistake. It was a pleasure to see that they didn’t know
everything.</p>
<p>One afternoon, after making some outlandish claim of devotion to my
work at school, I told my mother that I was going off to observe or
collect—it was all the same to me—one ridiculous thing or other. I was
off to see the Red Girl, of course, and I was especially happy to be
going on that day because my gift was an unusually beautiful marble—a
marble of blue porcelain. I had never seen a marble like it before, and
from the time I first saw it I wanted very much to possess it. I had
played against the girl to whom it belonged for three days in a row
until finally I won all her marbles—thirty-three—except for that one.
Then I had to play her and win six games in a row to get the prize—the
marble made of blue porcelain. Using the usual slamming-the
gate-and-quietly-creeping-back technique, I dived under the house to
retrieve the marble from the special place where I had hidden it. As I
came out from under the house, what should I see before me but my
mother’s two enormous, canvas-clad feet. From the look on my face, she
guessed immediately that I was up to something; from the look on her
face, I guessed immediately that everything was over. “What do you have
in your hand?” she asked, and I had no choice but to open my hand,
revealing the hard-earned prize to her angrier and angrier eyes.</p>
<p>My mother said, “Marbles? I had heard you played marbles, but I just
couldn’t believe it. You were not off to look for plants at all, you
were off to play marbles.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” I said. “Oh, no.”</p>
<p>“Where are your other marbles?” said my mother. “If you have one, you
have many.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” I said. “Oh, no. I don’t have marbles, because I don’t play
marbles.”</p>
<p>“You keep them under the house,” said my mother, completely ignoring
everything I said.</p>
<p>“Oh, no.”</p>
<p>“I am going to find them and throw them into the bottom of the sea,”
she said.</p>
<p>My mother now crawled under the house and began a furious and
incredible search for my marbles. If she and I had been taking a walk in
the Amazon forest, two of my steps equalling one of her strides, and
after a while she noticed that I was no longer at her side, her search
for me then would have equalled her search for my marbles now. On and on
went her search—behind some planks my father had stored years ago for
some long-forgotten use; behind some hatboxes that held old Christmas
and birthday cards and old letters from my mother’s family; tearing
apart my neat pile of books, which, if she had opened any one of them,
would have revealed to her, stamped on the title page, these words:
“Public Library, Antigua.” Of course, that would have been a whole other
story, and I can’t say which would have been worse, the stolen books or
playing marbles. On it went.</p>
<p>“Where are the marbles?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any marbles,” I would reply. “Only this one I found one
day as I was crossing the street to school.”</p>
<p>Of course I thought, At any minute I am going to die. For there were
the marbles staring right at me, staring right at her. Sometimes her
hand was actually resting on them. I had stored them in old cans, though
my most valued ones were in an old red leather handbag of hers. There
they were at her feet, as she rested for a moment, her heel actually
digging into the handbag. My heart could have stopped.</p>
<p>My father came home. My mother postponed the rest of the search. Over
supper, which, in spite of everything, I was allowed to eat with them,
she told him about the marbles, adding a list of things that seemed as
long as two chapters from the Old Testament. I could hardly recognize
myself from this list—how horrible I was—though all of it was true. But
still. They talked about me as if I weren’t there sitting in front of
them, as if I had boarded a boat for South America without so much as a
goodbye. I couldn’t remember my mother’s being so angry with me ever
before; in the meantime all thoughts of the Red Girl vanished from my
mind. Trying then to swallow a piece of bread that I had first softened
in my gravy, I thought, Well, that’s the end of that; if tomorrow I saw
that girl on the street, I would just act as if we had never met before,
as if her very presence at any time was only an annoyance. As my mother
went on to my father in her angry vein, I rearranged my life: Thank God
I hadn’t abandoned Gwen completely, thank God I was so good at rounders
that the girls would be glad to have me head a side again, thank God my
breasts hadn’t grown and I still needed some tips about them.</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Days went by. My mother kept up the search for the marbles. How she
would torment me! When I left for school, she saw me out the gate, then
watched me until I was a pin on the horizon. When I came home, there she
was waiting for me. Of course, there was no longer any question of going
off in the late afternoon for observations and gatherings. Not that I
wanted to anyway—all that was finished. But on it would go. She would
ask me for the marbles, and in my sweetest voice I would say I didn’t
have any. Each of us must have secretly vowed to herself not to give in
to the other. But then she tried this new tack. She told me this: When
she was a girl, it was her duty to accompany her father up to ground on
Saturdays. When they got there, her father would check on the plantain
and banana trees, the grapefruit and lime and lemon trees, and check the
mongoose traps. Before returning, they would harvest some food for the
family to eat in the coming week: plantains, green figs, grapefruit,
limes, lemons, coffee beans, cocoa beans, almonds, nutmegs, cloves,
dasheen, cassavas, all depending on what was ripe to be harvested. On
one particular day, after they had loaded up the donkeys with the
provisions, there was an extra bunch of green figs, and my mother was to
carry it on her head. She and her father started off for their home, and
as they walked my mother noticed that the bunch of figs grew heavier and
heavier—much heavier than any bunch of figs she had ever carried before.
She ached, from the top of her neck to the base of her spine. The weight
of the green figs caused her to walk slowly, and sometimes she lost
sight of her father. She was all alone on the road, and she heard all
sorts of sounds that she had never heard before and sounds that she
could not account for. Full of fright and in pain, she walked into her
yard, very glad to get rid of the green figs. She no sooner had taken
the load from her head when out of it crawled a very long black snake.
She didn’t have time to shout, it crawled away so quickly into the
bushes. Perhaps from fright, perhaps from the weight of the load she had
just gotten rid of, she collapsed.</p>
<p>When my mother came to the end of this story, I thought my heart
would break. Here was my mother, a girl then, certainly no older than I,
travelling up that road from the ground to her house with a snake on her
head. I had seen pictures of her at that age. What a beautiful girl she
was! So tall and thin. Long, thick black hair, which she wore in two
plaits that hung down past her shoulders. Her back was already curved
from not ever standing up straight, even though she got repeated
warnings. She was so shy that she never smiled enough for you to see her
teeth, and if she ever burst out laughing she would instantly cover her
mouth with her hands. She always obeyed her mother, and her sister
worshipped her. She, in turn, worshipped her brother, Joseph, and when
he died of something the doctor knew nothing about, of something the
obeah woman knew everything about, my mother refused food for a week.
Oh, to think of a dangerous, horrible black snake on top of that
beautiful head; to think of those beautifully arched, pink-soled feet
(the feet of which mine were an exact replica, as hers were an exact
replica of her mother’s) stumbling on the stony, uneven road, the weight
of snake and green figs too much for that small back. If only I had been
there, I would not have hesitated for even a part of a second to take
her place. How I would have loved my mother if I had known her then. To
have been the same age as someone so beautiful, someone who even then
loved books, someone who threw stones at monkeys in the forest! What I
wouldn’t have done for her. Nothing would ever be too much. And so,
feeling such love and such pity for this girl standing in front of me, I
was on the verge of giving to my mother my entire collection of marbles.
She wanted them so badly. What could some marbles matter? Already a
snake had sat on her head for miles. The words “The marbles are in the
corner over there” were on the very tip of my tongue, when I heard my
mother, her voice warm and soft and treacherous, say to me, “Well,
Little Miss, where are your marbles?” Summoning my own warm, soft, and
newly acquired treacherous voice, I said, “I don’t have any marbles. I
have never played marbles, you know.”</p>
<hr />
<p>—</p>
<p>Soon after, I started to menstruate, and I stopped playing marbles. I
was ashamed to be menstruating. It meant the end of everything. My
mother even said so. On giving me my little cloths and the instructions
on how to use them, she laughed her triumphant laugh and said, “You are
just like me. I was your age when I started.”</p>
<p>I never saw the Red Girl again. For a reason not having to do with
me, she had been sent to Anguilla to live with her grandparents and
finish her schooling. The night of the day I heard about it, I dreamt of
her. I dreamt that the boat on which she had been travelling suddenly
splintered in the middle of the sea, causing all the passengers to drown
except for her, whom I rescued in a small boat. I took her to an island,
where we lived together forever, I suppose, and fed on wild pigs and sea
grapes. At night, we would sit on the sand and watch ships filled with
people on a cruise steam by. We sent confusing signals to the ships,
causing them to crash on some nearby rocks. We laughed as their cries of
joy turned to cries of sorrow.</p>
