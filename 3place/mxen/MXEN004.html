<h4 id="stoicism">Stoicism</h4>
<ul>
<li>stoicism,英 [ˈstəʊɪsɪzəm] 美 [ˈstoʊɪsɪzəm]
n. 斯多葛哲学，斯多葛学派；恬淡寡欲</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the doctrines central to the Stoic worldview, perhaps the most
important is the unwavering conviction that the world is organized in a
rational and coherent way. More specifically, it is controlled and
directed by an all-pervading force that the Stoics designated by the
term logos. The term (from which English “logic” and the suffix “-logy”
derive) has a semantic range so broad as to be almost untranslatable. At
a basic level it designates rational, connected thought—whether
envisioned as a characteristic (rationality, the ability to reason) or
as the product of that characteristic (an intelligible utterance or a
connected discourse). Logos operates both in individuals and in the
universe as a whole. In individuals it is the faculty of reason. On a
cosmic level it is the rational principle that governs the organization
of the universe.1 In this sense it is synonymous with “nature,”
“Providence,” or “God.” (When the author of John’s Gospel tells us that
“the Word”—logos—was with God and is to be identified with God, he is
borrowing Stoic terminology.)</p>
<p>All events are determined by the logos, and follow in an unbreakable
chain of cause and effect. Stoicism is thus from the outset a
deterministic system that appears to leave no room for human free will
or moral responsibility. In reality the Stoics were reluctant to accept
such an arrangement, and attempted to get around the difficulty by
defining free will as a voluntary accommodation to what is in any case
inevitable. According to this theory, man is like a dog tied to a moving
wagon. If the dog refuses to run along with the wagon he will be dragged
by it, yet the choice remains his: to run or be dragged. In the same
way, humans are responsible for their choices and actions, even though
these have been anticipated by the logos and form part of its plan. Even
actions which appear to be—and indeed are—immoral or unjust advance the
overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and good. They,
too, are governed by the logos.</p>
<p>But the logos is not simply an impersonal power that governs and
directs the world. It is also an actual substance that pervades that
world, not in a metaphorical sense but in a form as concrete as oxygen
or carbon. In its physical embodiment, the logos exists as pneuma, a
substance imagined by the earliest Stoics as pure fire, and by
Chrysippus as a mixture of fire and air. Pneuma is the power—the vital
breath—that animates animals and humans. It is, in Dylan Thomas’s
phrase, “the force that through the green fuse drives the flower,” and
is present even in lifeless materials like stone or metal as the energy
that holds the object together—the internal tension that makes a stone a
stone. All objects are thus a compound of lifeless substance and vital
force. When Marcus refers, as he does on a number of occasions, to
“cause and material” he means the two elements of these compounds—inert
substance and animating pneuma—which are united so long as the object
itself exists. When the object perishes, the pneuma that animated it is
reabsorbed into the logos as a whole. This process of destruction and
reintegration happens to individual objects at every moment. It also
happens on a larger scale to the entire universe, which at vast
intervals is entirely consumed by fire (a process known as ekpyrosis),
and then regenerated.2</p>
<p>If the world is indeed orderly, if the logos controls all things,
then the order it produces should be discernible in all aspects of it.
That supposition not only led the Stoics to speculate about the nature
of the physical world but also motivated them to seek the rationality
characteristic of the logos in other areas, notably in formal logic and
the nature and structure of language (their interest in etymology is
reflected in several entries in the Meditations). This systematizing
impulse reappears in many other fields as well. The catalogue of
Chrysippus’s own works preserved by the late-third-century biographer
Diogenes Laertius is very long indeed; it includes not only
philosophical treatises in a narrow sense, but also works such as “On
How to Read Poetry” and “Against the Touching Up of Paintings.” Later
Stoics would try their hands at history and anthropology as well as more
conventionally philosophical topics.</p>
<p>The expansion of Stoic thought was not only intellectual but also
geographical. The movement had been born in Athens. In the century and a
half that followed Chrysippus’s death it spread to other centers, in
particular to Rome. The Romans of the second century B.C. were in the
midst of a course of conquest that by the end of the century would leave
them the effective masters of the Mediterranean. With conquest came
culture. Looking back on the rapid Hellenization of the Roman
aristocracy between 200 B.C. and his own day, the poet Horace famously
observed that “conquered Greece was the true conqueror.” Nowhere is the
influence of Greece more obvious than in philosophy. Greek philosophers,
including the Stoics, Panaetius (c. 185–109 B.C.), and Posidonius
(c. 135–50 B.C.), visited Rome to lecture. Many spent extended periods
there. In the first century B.C. it became the fashion for young
upper-class Romans to study in Athens, in an ancient version of the
eighteenth-century Grand Tour. Roman aristocrats acted as patrons to
individual philosophers and assembled large libraries of philosophical
texts (like that at the famous Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum), and
Romans like Cicero and Lucretius attempted to expound Greek
philosophical doctrines in Latin.</p>
<p>Of the major philosophical schools, it was Stoicism that had the
greatest appeal. Unlike some other sects, the Stoics had always approved
of participation in public life, and this stand struck a chord with the
Roman aristocracy, whose code of values placed a premium on political
and military activity. Stoicism has even been described, not altogether
unfairly, as the real religion of upper-class Romans. In the process it
became a rather different version of the philosophy from that taught by
Zeno and Chrysippus. Perhaps the most important development was a shift
in emphasis, a narrowing of focus. Early and middle Stoicism was a
holistic system. It aimed to embrace all knowledge, and its focus was
speculative and theoretical. Roman Stoicism, by contrast, was a
practical discipline—not an abstract system of thought, but an attitude
to life. Partly for historical reasons, it is this Romanized Stoicism
that has most influenced later generations. Indeed, the application of
the adjective “stoic” to a person who shows strength and courage in
misfortune probably owes more to the aristocratic Roman value system
than it does to Greek philosophers.</p>
<p>Stoicism in its later form was a system inspired as much by
individuals as by texts or doctrines. One of its most distinguished
adherents was Marcus Cato (known as Cato the Younger to distinguish him
from his great-grandfather, prominent a century earlier). A senator of
renowned rectitude when Julius Caesar marched on Rome in 49 B.C., Cato
sided with Caesar’s rival Pompey in defense of the legitimate
government. When it was clear that Caesar would triumph, Cato chose not
to survive the Republic, killing himself after the battle of Munda in
46. Within a century he had become an emblem of Stoic resistance to
tyranny. Under Nero he was immortalized by the poet Lucan and praised in
a laudatory biography by the senator Thrasea Paetus, whose own
resistance to Nero cost him his life. Thrasea’s son-in-law, Helvidius
Priscus, played a similar role—and came to a similar end—under
Vespasian. Thrasea and Helvidius in their turn served as role models to
second-century aristocrats like Marcus’s mentors Rusticus, Maximus, and
Severus. Marcus himself pays tribute to them (and to Cato) in
Meditations 1.14.</p>
<p>Cato, Thrasea, and Helvidius were doers, not writers, and their
legendary heroism inevitably lends them a somewhat two-dimensional
quality. A more complex and much more interesting figure was the poet
Lucan’s uncle, Lucius Annaeus Seneca (c. 4 B.C.–A.D. 65), commonly known
as Seneca the Younger to distinguish him from his equally distinguished
father. Originally councillor to the young Nero, he was eventually
forced to commit suicide after being implicated in an attempted coup
against his erstwhile pupil. Men’s lives are not always consistent with
their ideals, and some critics have found it hard to reconcile Seneca’s
fabulous wealth and his shameless flattery of Nero with his
philosophical views. Yet his works (in particular the Letters to
Lucilius) remain the most engaging and accessible expressions of later
Stoicism. Because they were written in Latin they were also among the
most influential on succeeding generations.</p>
<p>But not all Stoics were wealthy senators. There was another kind of
Stoic exemplar as well: the outsider whose ascetic lifestyle won him the
admiration of his wealthier contemporaries and enabled him to criticize
the pretenses of upper-class society with real authority. An early
example of the type is Gaius Musonius Rufus (c. 30–100), a member of the
Roman administrative class, the so-called knights (equites), who was
banished by both Nero and Vespasian. A still more dramatic example was
Musonius’s student Epictetus (c. 55–c. 135), who had taken up the
practice of philosophy as a slave and devoted the remainder of his life
to it after being freed. He had been exiled to Nicopolis (in northern
Greece) under Domitian, and after the tyrant’s death, elected to remain
there where he taught and lectured to visitors who often traveled great
distances to study with him.</p>
<p>One of these was the upper-class historian and statesman Arrian
(c. 86–160), who published an extensive record of the master’s
discussions, a text conventionally referred to as the Discourses of
Epictetus. He later produced an abridged version, the Encheiridion
(“Manual” or “Handbook”). Epictetus seems to have been an especially
important figure for Marcus. He thanks his philosophical mentor Rusticus
for introducing him to “Epictetus’s lectures” (either the Discourses
themselves or a private set of lecture notes), and a series of
quotations and paraphrases from the philosopher appear in Book 11 of the
Meditations. And Arrian’s abridged Encheiridion provides the closest
literary parallel to the Meditations itself, not only in its content,
but also in its form: a series of relatively short and unrelated
entries.</p>
