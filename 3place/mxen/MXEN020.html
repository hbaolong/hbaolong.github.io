<h4 id="book-9">Book 9</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Injustice is a kind of blasphemy. Nature designed rational beings
for each other’s sake: to help—not harm—one another, as they deserve. To
transgress its will, then, is to blaspheme against the oldest of the
gods.</li>
</ol>
<p>And to lie is to blaspheme against it too. Because “nature” means the
nature of that which is. And that which is and that which is the case
are closely linked, so that nature is synonymous with Truth—the source
of all true things. To lie deliberately is to blaspheme—the liar commits
deceit, and thus injustice. And likewise to lie without realizing it.
Because the involuntary liar disrupts the harmony of nature—its order.
He is in conflict with the way the world is structured. As anyone is who
deviates toward what is opposed to the truth—even against his will.
Nature gave him the resources to distinguish between true and false. And
he neglected them, and now can’t tell the difference.</p>
<p>And to pursue pleasure as good, and flee from pain as evil—that too
is blasphemous. Someone who does that is bound to find himself
constantly reproaching nature—complaining that it doesn’t treat the good
and bad as they deserve, but often lets the bad enjoy pleasure and the
things that produce it, and makes the good suffer pain, and the things
that produce pain. And moreover, to fear pain is to fear something
that’s bound to happen, the world being what it is—and that again is
blasphemy. While if you pursue pleasure, you can hardly avoid
wrongdoing—which is manifestly blasphemous.</p>
<p>Some things nature is indifferent to; if it privileged one over the
other it would hardly have created both. And if we want to follow
nature, to be of one mind with it, we need to share its indifference. To
privilege pleasure over pain—life over death, fame over anonymity—is
clearly blasphemous. Nature certainly doesn’t.</p>
<p>And when I say that nature is indifferent to them, I mean that they
happen indifferently, at different times, to the things that exist and
the things that come into being after them, through some ancient decree
of Providence—the decree by which from some initial starting point it
embarked on the creation that we know, by laying down the principles of
what was to come and determining the generative forces: existence and
change, and their successive stages.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Real good luck would be to abandon life without ever encountering
dishonesty, or hypocrisy, or self-indulgence, or pride. But the “next
best voyage” is to die when you’ve had enough. Or are you determined to
lie down with evil? Hasn’t experience even taught you that—to avoid it
like the plague? Because it is a plague—a mental cancer—worse than
anything caused by tainted air or an unhealthy climate. Diseases like
that can only threaten your life; this one attacks your
humanity.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t look down on death, but welcome it. It too is one of the
things required by nature. Like youth and old age. Like growth and
maturity. Like a new set of teeth, a beard, the first gray hair. Like
sex and pregnancy and childbirth. Like all the other physical changes at
each stage of life, our dissolution is no different.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with
indifference, not with impatience, not with disdain, but simply viewing
it as one of the things that happen to us. Now you anticipate the
child’s emergence from its mother’s womb; that’s how you should await
the hour when your soul will emerge from its compartment.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you need some tidy aphorism to tuck away in the back of
your mind. Well, consider two things that should reconcile you to death:
the nature of the things you’ll leave behind you, and the kind of people
you’ll no longer be mixed up with. There’s no need to feel resentment
toward them—in fact, you should look out for their well-being, and be
gentle with them—but keep in mind that everything you believe is
meaningless to those you leave behind. Because that’s all that could
restrain us (if anything could)—the only thing that could make us want
to stay here: the chance to live with those who share our vision. But
now? Look how tiring it is—this cacophony we live in. Enough to make you
say to death, “Come quickly. Before I start to forget myself, like
them.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>To do harm is to do yourself harm. To do an injustice is to do
yourself an injustice—it degrades you.</p></li>
<li><p>And you can also commit injustice by doing nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Objective judgment, now, at this very moment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Unselfish action, now, at this very moment.</p>
<p>Willing acceptance—now, at this very moment—of all external
events.</p>
<p>That’s all you need.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Blot out your imagination. Turn your desire to stone. Quench your
appetites. Keep your mind centered on itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals without the logos are assigned the same soul, and those
who have the logos share one too—a rational one. Just as all earthly
creatures share one earth. Just as we all see by the same light, and
breathe the same air—all of us who see and breathe.</p></li>
<li><p>All things are drawn toward what is like them, if such a thing
exists. All earthly things feel the earth’s tug. All wet things flow
together. And airy things as well, so they have to be forcibly prevented
from mixing. Fire is naturally drawn upward by that higher fire, but
ready to ignite at the slightest touch of other, earthly flame. So that
anything drier than usual makes good fuel, because less of what hinders
combustion is mixed in with it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And things that share an intelligent nature are just as prone to seek
out what is like them. If not more so. Because their superiority in
other ways is matched by their greater readiness to mix and mingle with
their counterparts.</p>
<p>Even in irrational beings we see swarms and herds, and nesting, and
love not unlike ours. Because they do have souls, and the bonding
instinct is found in a developed form—not something we see in plants, or
stones, or trees. And it’s still more developed in rational beings, with
their states, friendships, families, groups, their treaties and truces.
And in those yet more developed there is a kind of unity even between
separate things, the kind that we see in the stars. An advanced level of
development can produce a sympathy even in things that are quite
distinct.</p>
<p>But look how things are now. The rational things are the only ones
that have lost that sense of attraction—of convergence. Only there do we
not see that intermingling. But however much they try to avoid it,
there’s no escaping. Nature is stronger. As you can see if you look
closely.</p>
<p>Concrete objects can pull free of the earth more easily than humans
can escape humanity.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p>Humanity, divinity, and the world: all of them bearing fruit.
Each fruitful in its season. Normally we limit the word to vines and
other plants. Unnecessarily. The fruit of the logos nourishes both us
and it. And other things spring from it too—of the same species as the
logos itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Convince them not to.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you can.</p>
<p>And if not, remember: the capacity for patience was given us for a
reason. The gods are patient with them too, and even help them to
concrete things: health, money, fame. . . . Such is the gods’
goodness.</p>
<p>And yours, too, if you wanted. What’s stopping you?</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>Work:</li>
</ol>
<p>Not to rouse pity, not to win sympathy or admiration. Only this:</p>
<p>Activity.</p>
<p>Stillness.</p>
<p>As the logos of the state requires.</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li><p>Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it
was within me, in my own perceptions—not outside.</p></li>
<li><p>Known by long experience, limited in life span, debased in
substance—all of it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now as then, in the time of those we buried.</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>Things wait outside us, hover at the door. They keep to themselves.
Ask them who they are and they don’t know, they can give no account of
themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>What accounts for them?</p>
<p>The mind does.</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li><p>Not being done to, but doing—the source of good and bad for
rational and political beings. Where their own goodness and badness is
found—not in being done to, but in doing.</p></li>
<li><p>A rock thrown in the air. It loses nothing by coming down, gained
nothing by going up.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter their minds, and you’ll find the judges you’re so afraid
of—and how judiciously they judge themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything in flux. And you too will alter in the whirl and
perish, and the world as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave other people’s mistakes where they lie.</p></li>
<li><p>When we cease from activity, or follow a thought to its
conclusion, it’s a kind of death. And it doesn’t harm us. Think about
your life: childhood, boyhood, youth, old age. Every transformation a
kind of dying. Was that so terrible?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Think about life with your grandfather, your mother, your adopted
father. Realize how many other deaths and transformations and endings
there have been and ask yourself: Was that so terrible?</p>
<p>Then neither will the close of your life be—its ending and
transformation.</p>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li>Go straight to the seat of intelligence—your own, the world’s, your
neighbor’s.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your own—to ground it in justice.</p>
<p>The world’s—to remind yourself what it is that you’re part of.</p>
<p>Your neighbor’s—to distinguish ignorance from calculation. And
recognize it as like yours.</p>
<ol start="23" type="1">
<li><p>You participate in a society by your existence. Then participate
in its life through your actions—all your actions. Any action not
directed toward a social end (directly or indirectly) is a disturbance
to your life, an obstacle to wholeness, a source of dissension. Like the
man in the Assembly—a faction to himself, always out of step with the
majority.</p></li>
<li><p>Childish tantrums, children’s games, “spirits carrying corpses”;
“Odysseus in the Underworld” saw more real life.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify its purpose—what makes it what it is—and examine that.
(Ignore its concrete form.) Then calculate the length of time that such
a thing was meant to last.</p></li>
<li><p>Endless suffering—all from not allowing the mind to do its job.
Enough.</p></li>
<li><p>When you face someone’s insults, hatred, whatever . . . look at
his soul. Get inside him. Look at what sort of person he is. You’ll find
you don’t need to strain to impress him.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But you do have to wish him well. He’s your closest relative. The
gods assist him just as they do you—by signs and dreams and every other
way—to get the things he wants.</p>
<ol start="28" type="1">
<li>The world’s cycles never change—up and down, from age to age.</li>
</ol>
<p>Either the world’s intelligence wills each thing (if so, accept its
will), or it exercised that will once—once and for all—and all else
follows as a consequence (and if so, why worry?).</p>
<p>One way or another: atoms or unity. If it’s God, all is well. If it’s
arbitrary, don’t imitate it.</p>
<p>The earth will cover us all, and then be transformed in turn, and
that too will change, ad infinitum. And that as well, ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Think about them: the waves of change and alteration, endlessly
breaking. And see our brief mortality for what it is.</p>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li>The design of the world is like a flood, sweeping all before it. The
foolishness of them—little men busy with affairs of state, with
philosophy—or what they think of as philosophy. Nothing but phlegm and
mucus.</li>
</ol>
<p>—Well, then what?</p>
<p>Do what nature demands. Get a move on—if you have it in you—and don’t
worry whether anyone will give you credit for it. And don’t go expecting
Plato’s Republic; be satisfied with even the smallest progress, and
treat the outcome of it all as unimportant.</p>
<p>Who can change their minds? And without that change, what is there
but groaning, slavery, a pretense of obedience? Go on and cite
Alexander, Philip, Demetrius of Phalerum. Whether they knew nature’s
will and made themselves its student is for them to say. And if they
preferred to play the king? Well, no one forced me to be their
understudy.</p>
<p>The task of philosophy is modest and straightforward. Don’t tempt me
to presumption.</p>
<ol start="30" type="1">
<li>To see them from above: the thousands of animal herds, the rituals,
the voyages on calm or stormy seas, the different ways we come into the
world, share it with one another, and leave it. Consider the lives led
once by others, long ago, the lives to be led by others after you, the
lives led even now, in foreign lands. How many people don’t even know
your name. How many will soon have forgotten it. How many offer you
praise now—and tomorrow, perhaps, contempt.</li>
</ol>
<p>That to be remembered is worthless. Like fame. Like everything.</p>
<ol start="31" type="1">
<li>Indifference to external events.</li>
</ol>
<p>And a commitment to justice in your own acts.</p>
<p>Which means: thought and action resulting in the common good.</p>
<p>What you were born to do.</p>
<ol start="32" type="1">
<li>You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind—things that
exist only there—and clear out space for yourself:</li>
</ol>
<p>. . . by comprehending the scale of the world</p>
<p>. . . by contemplating infinite time</p>
<p>. . . by thinking of the speed with which things change—each part of
every thing; the narrow space between our birth and death; the infinite
time before; the equally unbounded time that follows.</p>
<ol start="33" type="1">
<li><p>All that you see will soon have vanished, and those who see it
vanish will vanish themselves, and the ones who reached old age have no
advantage over the untimely dead.</p></li>
<li><p>What their minds are like. What they work at. What evokes their
love and admiration.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Imagine their souls stripped bare. And their vanity. To suppose that
their disdain could harm anyone—or their praise help them.</p>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li>To decompose is to be recomposed.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s what nature does. Nature—through whom all things happen as
they should, and have happened forever in just the same way, and will
continue to, one way or another, endlessly.</p>
<p>That things happen for the worst and always will, that the gods have
no power to regulate them, and the world is condemned to never-ending
evil—how can you say that?</p>
<ol start="36" type="1">
<li>Disgust at what things are made of: Liquid, dust, bones, filth. Or
marble as hardened dirt, gold and silver as residues, clothes as hair,
purple dye as shellfish blood. And all the rest.</li>
</ol>
<p>And the same with our living breath—transformed from one thing to
another.</p>
<ol start="37" type="1">
<li>Enough of this wretched, whining monkey life.</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s the matter? Is any of this new? What is it you find
surprising?</p>
<p>The purpose? Look at it.</p>
<p>The material? Look at that.</p>
<p>That’s all there is.</p>
<p>And the gods? Well, you could try being simpler, gentler. Even
now.</p>
<p>A hundred years or three. . . . No difference.</p>
<ol start="38" type="1">
<li>If they’ve injured you, then they’re the ones who suffer for
it.</li>
</ol>
<p>But have they?</p>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li>Either all things spring from one intelligent source and form a
single body (and the part should accept the actions of the whole) or
there are only atoms, joining and splitting forever, and nothing
else.</li>
</ol>
<p>So why feel anxiety?</p>
<p>Say to your mind: Are you dead? damaged? brutal? dishonest?</p>
<p>Are you one of the herd? or grazing like one?</p>
<ol start="40" type="1">
<li>Either the gods have power or they don’t. If they don’t, why pray?
If they do, then why not pray for something else instead of for things
to happen or not to happen? Pray not to feel fear. Or desire, or grief.
If the gods can do anything, they can surely do that for us.</li>
</ol>
<p>—But those are things the gods left up to me.</p>
<p>Then isn’t it better to do what’s up to you—like a free man—than to
be passively controlled by what isn’t, like a slave or beggar? And what
makes you think the gods don’t care about what’s up to us?</p>
<p>Start praying like this and you’ll see.</p>
<p>Not “some way to sleep with her”—but a way to stop wanting to.</p>
<p>Not “some way to get rid of him”—but a way to stop trying.</p>
<p>Not “some way to save my child”—but a way to lose your fear.</p>
<p>Redirect your prayers like that, and watch what happens.</p>
<ol start="41" type="1">
<li>Epicurus: “During my illness, my conversations were not about my
physical state; I did not waste my visitors’ time with things of that
sort, but went on discussing philosophy, and concentrated on one point
in particular: how the mind can participate in the sensations of the
body and yet maintain its serenity, and focus on its own well-being. Nor
did I let my doctors strut about like grandees. I went on living my life
the way it should be lived.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Like that. In illness—or any other situation.</p>
<p>Not to let go of philosophy, no matter what happens; not to bandy
words with crackpots and philistines—good rules for any philosopher.</p>
<p>Concentrate on what you’re doing, and what you’re doing it with.</p>
<ol start="42" type="1">
<li>When you run up against someone else’s shamelessness, ask yourself
this: Is a world without shamelessness possible?</li>
</ol>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Then don’t ask the impossible. There have to be shameless people in
the world. This is one of them.</p>
<p>The same for someone vicious or untrustworthy, or with any other
defect. Remembering that the whole class has to exist will make you more
tolerant of its members.</p>
<p>Another useful point to bear in mind: What qualities has nature given
us to counter that defect? As an antidote to unkindness it gave us
kindness. And other qualities to balance other flaws.</p>
<p>And when others stray off course, you can always try to set them
straight, because every wrongdoer is doing something wrong—doing
something the wrong way.</p>
<p>And how does it injure you anyway? You’ll find that none of the
people you’re upset about has done anything that could do damage to your
mind. But that’s all that “harm” or “injury” could mean. Yes, boorish
people do boorish things. What’s strange or unheard-of about that? Isn’t
it yourself you should reproach—for not anticipating that they’d act
this way? The logos gave you the means to see it—that a given person
would act a given way—but you paid no attention. And now you’re
astonished that he’s gone and done it. So when you call someone
“untrustworthy” or “ungrateful,” turn the reproach on yourself. It was
you who did wrong. By assuming that someone with those traits deserved
your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return,
instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What else did
you expect from helping someone out? Isn’t it enough that you’ve done
what your nature demands? You want a salary for it too? As if your eyes
