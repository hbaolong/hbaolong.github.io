<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>1.1 My grandfather Verus: Verus (1).</p>
<p>1.2 My father: Verus (2).</p>
<p>1.3 My mother: Lucilla.</p>
<p>1.4 My great-grandfather: Severus (1).</p>
<p>To avoid the public schools: Roman aristocrats normally preferred to
have their sons educated by private tutors (often specially trained
household slaves) who were considered safer and more reliable than the
professional schoolmasters who taught all comers for a fee.</p>
<p>1.5 My first teacher: Not named and most likely a slave.</p>
<p>Not to support this side or that: Literally, “not to be a Green or a
Blue; not to support the parmularius [a gladiator with a small shield]
or the scutarius [who carried a larger shield].”</p>
<p>1.6 the camp-bed and the cloak: Symbols of an ascetic lifestyle.
Marcus’s sleeping arrangements are recorded by the Historia Augusta: “He
used to sleep on the ground, and his mother had a hard time convincing
him to sleep on a cot spread with skins.”</p>
<p>1.7 his own copy: It is unclear whether this refers to Arrian’s
Discourses of Epictetus or to a set of unpublished notes, perhaps taken
by Rusticus himself.</p>
<p>1.13 Domitius and Athenodotus: The anecdote Marcus refers to is
unknown.</p>
<p>1.14 My brother: Probably a copyist’s error based on confusion
between the names Verus and Severus.</p>
<p>Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato: For the significance of these three figures
as Stoic exemplars see the Introduction.</p>
<p>1.16 My adopted father: Antoninus Pius. The sketch here seems to be a
development and expansion of the briefer assessment in 6.30.</p>
<p>Putting a stop to the pursuit of boys: This may be meant as a
critique of Antoninus’s predecessor, Hadrian (2), whose love affair with
the youth Antinoüs was notorious. Alternatively it might refer to legal
restrictions on pederasty (which was common in upper-class Greek and
Roman society), or to Antoninus’s own self-restraint.</p>
<p>The robe . . . the customs agent’s apology: These examples of
Antoninus’s modesty are too compressed and allusive to be intelligible
to anyone but Marcus himself.</p>
<p>as they say of Socrates: Marcus may be recalling a similar comment by
Xenophon, Memorabilia 1.3.14; Socrates’ ability to drink heavily without
any apparent effect is celebrated in Plato’s Symposium (179c, 220a).</p>
<p>Maximus’s illness: For Maximus see the Index of Persons; nothing is
known of his illness.</p>
<p>1.17 someone: Antoninus.</p>
<p>he kind of brother: Verus (3).</p>
<p>he honors they seemed to want: Marcus may be thinking of Herodes
Atticus and Fronto, both of whom held consulships in 143, soon after
Marcus became the heir apparent. Perhaps also of Rusticus, who held a
second consulship in 162.</p>
<p>I never laid a finger: Household slaves were often exposed to sexual
abuse at the hands of their owners.</p>
<p>That I have the wife I do: Faustina.</p>
<p>at Caieta: A seaport on the west coast of Italy. The Greek text adds
an unintelligible phrase, which some scholars interpret as a reference
to “an oracle.”</p>
<p>“we need the help . . .”: Apparently a quotation, but not from any
surviving work.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>On the River Gran, Among the Quadi: The notation is transmitted at
the end of Book 1, but is more likely to belong here. The Gran (or Hron)
is a tributary of the Danube flowing through modern-day Slovakia. The
Quadi were a Suebian tribe in the Morava River valley, subdued during
the Marcomannic Wars of the early 170s.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.2 Throw away . . . right now: These words are deleted or transposed
elsewhere by some editors.</p>
<p>2.10 the ones committed out of desire are worse: Strictly speaking,
this assessment is in conflict with Stoic doctrine, which holds that
there are no degrees of wrongness; all wrong actions are equally wrong
and it makes no sense to speak of one as being “worse” than another.</p>
<p>2.13 “delving into . . .”: A line from the lyric poet Pindar (frg.
282), quoted also by Plato, Theaetetus 173e.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>In Carnuntum: Transmitted at the end of Book 2, but probably meant
to head Book 3. Carnuntum was a fortress on the Danube which housed the
Legio XIV Gemina and served as the seat of the governor of Upper
Pannonia. Marcus is known to have been in the area in 172 and 173.</li>
</ol>
<p>3.3 Chaldaeans: The Chaldaeans (Babylonians) had a special reputation
as astrologers.</p>
<p>Democritus: Apparently an error for another pre-Socratic philosopher,
Pherecydes, who was said to have been eaten by worms. (Democritus’s name
was often coupled with that of Heraclitus, which may explain Marcus’s
slip here.)</p>
<p>Socrates: The “vermin” who killed Socrates are the Athenians who
prosecuted and condemned him.</p>
<p>3.6 as Socrates used to say: It is not clear whether Marcus is
alluding to a specific passage (perhaps Plato, Phaedo 83a–b) or merely
to a general impression of Socratic doctrine.</p>
<p>3.14 your Brief Comments: Evidently collections of anecdotes and/or
quotations put together by Marcus himself for his own use, like parts of
the extant Meditations.</p>
<p>3.15 They don’t realize . . . : The significance of this entry
(particularly the last phrase) is unclear.</p>
<p>3.16 people who do &lt; . . . &gt;: It seems clear that something is
missing from the text, perhaps deliberately omitted by a prudish
copyist.</p>
<p>4.3 to ward off all &lt; . . . &gt;: The missing word must be
something like “anxiety.”</p>
<p>“The world is nothing but change . . .”: Democritus frg. B 115.</p>
<p>4.18 &lt; . . . &gt; not to be distracted: The text as transmitted
includes the words “good,” “black character,” and “suspicion,” but no
coherent sense can be made of them.</p>
<p>4.19 You’re out of step . . . : The text of this sentence is
disturbed and the translation correspondingly uncertain.</p>
<p>4.23 The poet: Aristophanes frg. 112.</p>
<p>4.24 “If you seek tranquillity . . .”: Democritus frg. B 3.</p>
<p>4.30 A philosopher without clothes . . . : If the text is sound it is
not easy to interpret convincingly. The rendering here (which differs
from most previous versions) represents my best guess at the sense, but
is far from certain.</p>
<p>4.33 Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus: Heroes of the Roman Republic
(see the Index of Persons). Only Camillus was well known; the others may
have been purposely chosen for their obscurity.</p>
<p>“unknown, unasked-for”: Homer, Odyssey 1.242.</p>
<p>4.41 “A little wisp of soul . . .”: Epictetus frg. 26 (presumably
from one of the lost books of the Discourses).</p>
<p>4.46 “When earth dies . . .”: Heraclitus frg. B 76.</p>
<p>“Those who have forgotten . . .”: idem. frg. B 71.</p>
<p>“They are at odds . . .”: idem. frg. B 72.</p>
<p>“they find alien . . .”: idem. frg. B 73.</p>
<p>“Our words and actions . . .”: idem. frg. B 74.</p>
<p>4.48 Helike, Pompeii, Herculaneum: Helike was a Greek city destroyed
by an earthquake and tidal wave in 373 B.C. Pompeii and its neighbor
city Herculaneum were destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in
A.D. 79.</p>
<p>4.49a It’s unfortunate: It has been plausibly suggested that this
entry is a quotation from a lost section of Epictetus’s Discourses.</p>
<p>4.50 Caedicianus, Fabius, Julian, Lepidus: With the possible
exception of Caedicianus and Lepidus (see the Index of Persons), none of
these figures can be identified.</p>
<p>5.8 “the doctor”: Literally, “Asclepius.” Patients sleeping in his
temple sometimes had dream visions of the god and received suggestions
for treatment from him. But the name might simply indicate a human
physician.</p>
<p>5.10 a pervert: The Greek word (used also in 6.34) is a contemptuous
term referring to the passive partner in homosexual intercourse; it has
no exact English equivalent (“pervert,” although overly broad, at least
has the right tone). Marcus is probably using it as a generalized term
of abuse.</p>
<p>5.12 “so many goods . . .”: Proverbial: the rich man owns “so many
goods he has no place to shit.” The saying is at least as old as the
fourth-century B.C. comic poet Menander, who quotes it in the surviving
fragments of his play The Apparition.</p>
<p>5.29 If the smoke makes me cough: The metaphor is drawn from
Epictetus, Discourses 1.25.18.</p>
<p>5.31 “wrong and unworthy . . .”: Homer, Odyssey 4.690.</p>
<p>5.33 “gone from the earth . . .”: Hesiod, Works and Days 197.</p>
<p>5.36 Not to be overwhelmed: The remainder of this book is
unintelligible in places, perhaps because the end of the original
papyrus roll suffered accidental damage. I have divided the text into
three separate sections, but without great confidence that this is
correct.</p>
<p>Like the old man: The reference is obscure. A scene from a lost
tragedy?</p>
<p>6.13 Crates on Xenocrates: The meaning of this reference is
unknown.</p>
<p>6.30 Take Antoninus as your model: The sketch that follows seems to
be a preliminary version of the longer portrait at 1.16.</p>
<p>6.34 perverts: See 5.10 note.</p>
<p>6.42 “those who sleep . . .”: Heraclitus frg. B 75.</p>
<p>he bad line in the play: Chrysippus frg. 1181 (= Plutarch, On Stoic
Self-Contradictions 13f.). Chrysippus compared the existence of evil to
a deliberately bathetic line in a comedy—bad in itself, but an essential
part of a good play.</p>
<p>7.12 not: The transmitted text reads “or,” but this can hardly be
correct (compare 3.5).</p>
<p>7.15 Like gold or emerald or purple: Compare Epictetus, Discourses
1.2.17–18: “You see yourself as one thread in a garment . . . But I want
to be the purple thread, the small, glistening one that enhances the
others.”</p>
<p>7.24 “ . . . “ or in the end is put out: I have omitted a short
phrase from which it is impossible to extract any meaning.</p>
<p>7.31a “. . . all are relative . . .”: A paraphrase of Democritus frg.
B 9, in which qualities like sweetness or bitterness are said to be
“relative” or “conventional” rather than inherent (what tastes sweet to
one person may be bitter to another). Marcus apparently sees the
observation as compatible with the Stoic doctrine that “it’s all in how
you perceive it” (12.8), though he naturally rejects the subsequent
reference to atoms. The final phrase is corrupt beyond repair.</p>
<p>7.32 [On death]: The headings of this and the next two entries are
probably not Marcus’s own, but additions by a later reader.</p>
<p>7.35 “If his mind is filled . . .”: Plato, Republic 6.486a.</p>
<p>7.36 “Kingship . . .”: Antisthenes frg. 20b (also quoted by
Epictetus, Discourses 4.6.20).</p>
<p>7.38 “And why should we feel anger . . .”: Euripides, frg. 287 (from
the lost Bellerophon quoted also at 11.6).</p>
<p>7.39 “May you bring joy . . .”: Source unknown; perhaps from a lost
epic.</p>
<p>7.40 “To harvest life . . .”: Euripides, frg. 757 (from the lost
Hypsipyle).</p>
<p>7.41 “If I and my two children . . .”: Euripides, frg. 208 (from the
lost Antiope; quoted also at 11.6).</p>
<p>7.42 “For what is just and good . . .”: Ibid., frg. 918 (from an
unknown play).</p>
<p>7.43 No chorus of lamentation: This might be a quotation, like the
preceding entries, but if so, we do not know its source.</p>
<p>7.44 “Then the only proper response . . .”: Plato, Apology 28b.</p>
<p>7.45 “It’s like this . . .”: Ibid., 28d.</p>
<p>7.46 “But, my good friend . . .”: Plato, Gorgias 512d.</p>
<p>7.48 [Plato has it right]: The passage that follows does not
correspond to anything in Plato’s preserved writings, and it seems
likely that the phrase was inserted by a later reader who mistook it for
a quotation.</p>
<p>7.50 “Earth’s offspring . . .”: Euripides, frg. 839 (from the lost
Chrysippus).</p>
<p>7.51 “. . . with food and drink . . .”: Euripides, Suppliants
1110–1111.</p>
<p>7.51a “To labor cheerfully . . .”: From an unknown tragedy.</p>
<p>7.63 “Against our will . . .”: Epictetus, Discourses 1.28.4 (also
2.22.37), paraphrasing Plato, Sophist 228c.</p>
<p>7.64 what Epicurus said: Epicurus frg. 447.</p>
<p>7.66 by spending the night out in the cold: This anecdote is told by
Alcibiades in Plato’s Symposium (220).</p>
<p>he man from Salamis: During the brief reign of the “Thirty Tyrants”
at Athens, Socrates was ordered to collaborate with the regime by
arresting a certain Leon, but refused; the story is told in Plato’s
Apology (32c).</p>
<p>“swaggered about the streets”: A line from Aristophanes’ comedy
Clouds (362), which pokes fun at Socrates.</p>
<p>8.25 Verus . . . Lucilla: Marcus’s parents.</p>
<p>Hadrian: Most likely this refers to the rhetorician (Hadrian 1)
rather than the emperor (Hadrian 2).</p>
<p>8.35 We have various abilities . . . : The text here appears to be
corrupt and the translation is necessarily uncertain.</p>
<p>8.38 Look at it clearly: The text, meaning and articulation of
entries 38 and 39 are very uncertain. Earlier editors printed the
opening of 38 as the end of 37, and took the phrases “Look at it
clearly—if you can” and “To the best of my judgment” as a single unit,
though the resulting sentence yields no coherent sense. I follow J.
Dalfen in separating them.</p>
<p>8.39 “To the best of my judgment . . .”: I have placed the entry in
quotation marks on the basis of the opening phrase, which includes a
parenthetical “he [or “someone”] says.” This assumes that the phrase is
correctly transmitted (it is certainly not easy to construe), and that
it should be taken with what follows rather than what precedes, which is
far from certain (see previous note). However, the entry as a whole (an
implicit criticism of the Epicureans’ view of pleasure as the supreme
good) does not strike me as being typical of Marcus’s style, and I
suspect he may indeed be quoting some earlier writer.</p>
<p>8.41 “a sphere . . .”: Empedocles frg. B27, quoted in fuller form at
12.3.</p>
<p>8.57 Its beams get their name . . . : This (false) derivation is a
typical example of ancient etymology, a science in which the early
Stoics were much interested.</p>
<p>9.2 the “next best voyage”: A proverbial phrase meaning having to row
when one cannot sail.</p>
<p>9.24 “Odysseus in the Underworld”: The reference is to Book 11 of the
Odyssey, in which Odysseus descends to Hades and encounters the shades
of his companions who died at Troy.</p>
<p>9.29 Demetrius of Phalerum: It has been suggested that “of Phalerum”
is a later reader’s (mistaken) addition, and that Marcus had in mind the
Hellenistic monarch Demetrius Poliorcetes (“the city-sacker”). But there
seems no reason to doubt the transmitted text.</p>
<p>9.41 “During my illness . . .”: Epicurus frg. 191.</p>
<p>10.10 Sarmatians: One of the barbarian tribes Marcus spent his last
decade fighting.</p>
<p>10.21 “The earth knows longing . . .”: Euripides frg. 898.</p>
<p>10.23 “fencing a sheepfold . . .”: A paraphrase of Plato, Theaetetus
174d, in which we are told that the philosopher will look down on a king
as if the latter were a humble shepherd.</p>
<p>10.31 When you look . . . : Most of the names mentioned here are mere
ciphers (see the Index of Persons for the best guess as to their
identities), but Marcus’s point does not depend on knowledge of the
individuals.</p>
<p>10.33 as a cylinder rolls down: The comparison is taken from
Chrysippus frg. 1000.</p>
<p>10.34 “. . . leaves that the wind . . .”: Homer, Iliad 6.147 ff., a
very famous passage.</p>
<p>11.3 [like the Christians]: This ungrammatical phrase is almost
certainly a marginal comment by a later reader; there is no reason to
think Marcus had the Christians in mind here. (See Introduction.)</p>
<p>11.6 “o Mount Cithaeron!”: Sophocles, Oedipus the King 1391
(Oedipus’s anguished cry after blinding himself, invoking the mountain
he was abandoned on as a baby.)</p>
<p>“If I and my two children . . .”: See on 7.41.</p>
<p>“And why should we feel anger . . . ?”: See on 7.38.</p>
<p>“To harvest life . . .”: See on 7.40.</p>
<p>11.18 from Apollo: Often depicted as the leader of the nine
Muses.</p>
<p>11.22 The town mouse: Aesop, Fables 297. The significance of the
allusion is unclear.</p>
<p>11.23 “the monsters under the bed”: Plato, Crito 46c and Phaedo 77e;
Marcus is probably drawing on Epictetus, Discourses 2.1.14.</p>
<p>11.25 Perdiccas’s invitation: In fact the ruler who invited Socrates
to his court was Perdiccas’s successor Archelaus (resigned 413–399).</p>
<p>11.26 This advice: Epicurus frg. 210.</p>
<p>11.28 Socrates dressed in a towel: The anecdote is not preserved.</p>
<p>11.30 “For you/Are but a slave . . .”: From a lost tragedy. Marcus
twists what must have been the sense of the original (“it is not for you
to speak”) by taking logos in its broader, philosophical sense.</p>
<p>11.31 “But my heart rejoiced”: Homer, Odyssey 9.413.</p>
<p>11.32 “And jeer at virtue . . .”: Hesiod, Works and Days 186, but
“virtue” is Marcus’s substitution. Hesiod has “and jeer at them,” in a
completely different context.</p>
<p>11.33 Stupidity is expecting figs: A paraphrase of Epictetus,
Discourses 3.24.86.</p>
<p>11.34 As you kiss your son: Ibid., 3.24.88.</p>
<p>11.36 “No thefts of free will . . .”: Ibid., 3.22.105 (the
attribution in the text is probably an addition by a later reader who

<p>Index of Persons</p>
<p>This list covers only persons named, referred to, or quoted in the
text of the Meditations itself.</p>
<p>AGRIPPA: Roman general; adviser and close associate of AUGUSTUS,
whose daughter he married. (8.31)</p>
<p>ALCIPHRON: Not certainly identified, although the context makes it
clear that he must be a contemporary of Marcus’s. He might be the
Alciphron who authored a surviving collection of imaginary letters from
courtesans, fishermen, etc., or a philosopher from Magnesia on the
Maeander, quoted twice by the third-century antiquarian Athenaeus.
(10.31)</p>
<p>ALEXANDER (1) “THE LITERARY CRITIC”: A Greek from Cotiaeum in Syria,
teacher of the great orator Aelius Aristides, as well as Marcus.
(1.10)</p>
<p>ALEXANDER (2) “THE PLATONIST”: A literary figure, mockingly dubbed
Alexander Peloplaton (“The Play-Doh Plato”) by his rivals. He served as
head of the Greek side of the imperial secretariat. (1.12)</p>
<p>ALEXANDER (3) “THE GREAT”: (356–323 B.C.), ruler of Macedon (336–323)
who conquered much of the Near and Middle East before dying at the age
of thirty-three. His career was a favorite topic for moralizers and
rhetoricians. (3.3, 6.24, 8.3, 9.29, 10.27)</p>
<p>ANTISTHENES: Follower of SOCRATES and forerunner of the Cynic school
(quoted 7.36).</p>
<p>ANTONINUS: Titus Aurelius Antoninus Pius, Roman emperor (138–161). He
adopted Marcus in 138 at the age of sixteen (1.16, 1.17, 4.33, 6.30,
8.25, 9.21, 10.27). Marcus also refers to himself by this name
(6.44).</p>
<p>APOLLONIUS: Apollonius of Chalcedon, Stoic philosopher and one of
Marcus’s teachers. (1.8, 1.17)</p>
<p>ARCHIMEDES: Mathematician, scientist and engineer (c. 287–212 B.C.)
from the Greek city of Syracuse in Sicily, known especially for his work
on hydrostatics. (6.47)</p>
<p>AREIUS: Stoic philosopher prominent at the court of AUGUSTUS.
(8.31)</p>
<p>ARISTOPHANES: Athenian comic playwright (c. 455–c. 386 B.C.). Eleven
of his approximately forty comedies survive, and are characterized by
fantastic plots, scatological dialogue, outrageous political satire, and
elegant choral songs. (quoted 4.23, 7.66)</p>
<p>ASCLEPIUS: Greek god of medicine. (6.43; compare 5.8 and note)</p>
<p>ATHENODOTUS: A Stoic philosopher and teacher of FRONTO. (1.13)</p>
<p>AUGUSTUS: (63 B.C.–A.D. 14). Born Gaius Octaviaus, great-nephew and
adopted son of Julius CAESAR. He attained power following Caesar’s
assassination and became sole ruler of the Roman world after defeating
Caesar’s lieutenant Marcus Antonius at the battle of Actium in 31 B.C.
Through his lieutenants AGRIPPA and MAECENAS he was responsible for
major civic improvements and an active program of literary and artistic
patronage. (4.33, 8.5, 8.31)</p>
<p>BACCHEIUS: Platonic philosopher. (1.6)</p>
<p>BENEDICTA: Unknown, but she and THEODOTUS were most likely household
slaves. (1.17)</p>
<p>BRUTUS: Marcus Junius Brutus (85–42 B.C.), Roman aristocrat and
politician who led the conspiracy to assassinate Julius CAESAR in 44
B.C. and committed suicide when the battle of Philippi ended hopes of
restoring the Republic. (1.14)</p>
<p>CAEDICIANUS: Perhaps identical with a governor of Dacia in the 120s
and 130s. (4.50)</p>
<p>CAESAR: Gaius Julius Caesar (100–44 B.C.), Roman politician and
general who marched on Rome in 49 B.C., precipitating a civil war
against forces loyal to POMPEY and the Senate. After the defeat of the
Republican forces at the battle of Pharsalia and the murder of Pompey he
was made dictator for life, but assassinated in 44 B.C. (3.3, 8.3)</p>
<p>CAESO: Unknown, though obviously a figure from Republican history.
(4.33)</p>
<p>CAMILLUS: Marcus Furius Camillus, the (perhaps mythical)
fourth-century B.C. general who saved Rome when it was under attack by
invading Gauls. (4.33)</p>
<p>CATO (1): Marcus Porcius Cato “the Elder,” consul and censor in the
second century B.C.; author of a surviving work on agriculture and a
lost history. He was an emblem of Roman moral rectitude and rough
virtue. (4.33)</p>
<p>CATO (2): Marcus Porcius Cato “the Younger” (95–46 B.C.),
great-grandson of Cato (1), a senator and well-known Stoic in the late
Republic. He fought on the Republican side against Julius CAESAR and
committed suicide after the battle of Thapsus. He was immortalized in
the poet Lucan’s epic The Civil War, and became an emblem of Stoic
resistance to tyranny. (1.14)</p>
<p>CATULUS: Cinna Catulus is named, along with MAXIMUS, as a Stoic
mentor of Marcus’s by the Historia Augusta, but nothing else is known of
him. (1.13)</p>
<p>CECROPS: Legendary founder of Athens. (4.23)</p>
<p>CELER: Rhetorician who taught both Marcus and Lucius VERUS.
(8.25)</p>
<p>CHABRIAS: Evidently an associate of HADRIAN (2), like DIOTIMUS, but
not otherwise known. (8.37)</p>
<p>CHARAX: Perhaps Charax of Pergamum, a historian known from other
sources to have been active in the second or third century. (8.25)</p>
<p>CHRYSIPPUS: Stoic philosopher (280–207 B.C.), succeeded Zeno and
Cleanthes as leader of the school. His writings laid out the fundamental
doctrines of early Stoicism. (6.42, 7.19)</p>
<p>CLOTHO: One of the three Fates of Greek mythology who are imagined as
spinning or weaving human fortunes. (4.34)</p>
<p>CRATES: Cynic philosopher (c. 365–285 B.C.) and disciple of DIOGENES.
(6.13)</p>
<p>CRITO: Most likely the physician Titus Statilius Crito, active under
Trajan. (10.31)</p>
<p>CROESUS: Sixth-century king of Lydia, famous for his wealth and power
until his kingdom fell to the Persians. (10.27)</p>
<p>DEMETER: Greek goddess of agriculture. (6.43)</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS (1) OF PHALERUM: Fourth-century B.C. philosopher, student
of THEOPHRASTUS and governor of Athens under Macedonian rule. (9.29)</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS (2) THE PLATONIST: Probably not Demetrius (1), who was an
adherent of the Peripatetic school, not a Platonist. A Cynic philosopher
banished by VESPASIAN has also been suggested, but the reference is more
likely to a contemporary figure now unknown. (8.25)</p>
<p>DEMOCRITUS: Pre-Socratic philosopher (c. 460–370 B.C.) best known for
developing the theory of atoms later adopted by the Epicureans. (3.3;
quoted 4.3, 4.24, 7.31a)</p>
<p>DENTATUS: Manius Curius Dentatus, third-century B.C. Roman general.
(4.33)</p>
<p>DIOGENES: Greek philosopher (c. 400–c. 325 B.C.) and founder of the
Cynic school, notable for his extreme ascetic lifestyle and contempt for
social conventions. (8.3, 11.6)</p>
<p>DIOGNETUS: Marcus’s drawing teacher (according to the Historia
Augusta), though the entry suggests that he played a greater role in
Marcus’s development than this might suggest. (1.6)</p>
<p>DION: Sicilian aristocrat, a protégé of Plato, who saw in him a
potential philosopher-king. (1.14)</p>
<p>DIOTIMUS: Evidently an associate of HADRIAN (2), not otherwise known.
(8.25, 8.37)</p>
<p>DOMITIUS: Unidentified, perhaps a student of ATHENODOTUS. (1.13)</p>
<p>EMPEDOCLES: Fifth-century B.C. Greek philosopher and poet who
regarded the natural world as the result of constant mingling and
separating of four basic elements. (quoted 8.41, 12.3)</p>
<p>EPICTETUS: Stoic philosopher (c. 55–c. 135), a former slave from
Phrygia who was among the most influential figures in later Stoicism. A
record of his lectures and discussions (the Discourses) was published by
his student Arrian, along with an abridged version (the Encheiridion, or
“Handbook”). See also Introduction. (1.7, 7.19; quoted or paraphrased
4.41, 5.29, 7.63, 11.33–34, 11.36–38; cf. 4.49a and note)</p>
<p>EPICURUS: Greek philosopher (341–270 B.C.) and founder of one of the
two great Hellenistic philosophical systems. Epicureans identified
pleasure as the supreme good in life and viewed the world as a random
conglomeration of atoms, not ruled by any larger providence. (quoted
7.64, 9.41; compare 11.26)</p>
<p>EPITYNCHANUS: Perhaps a slave or freedman of HADRIAN (2). (8.25)</p>
<p>EUDAEMON: Perhaps to be identified with a literary official prominent
under Hadrian (2). (8.25)</p>
<p>EUDOXUS: Greek mathematician and astronomer active in the fourth
century B.C. (6.47)</p>
<p>EUPHRATES: Perhaps the philosopher mentioned by Pliny the Younger
(Letters 1.10) and evidently close to HADRIAN (2), but he might be a
later imperial official mentioned by Galen. (10.31)</p>
<p>EURIPIDES: Athenian playwright (480s–407/6 B.C.); some twenty of his
tragedies are still extant. His plays were controversial in his
lifetime, but in subsequent centuries he was among the most popular of
Greek authors, thanks in large part to his quotability and accessible
style. (quoted 7.38, 7.40–42, 7.50–51, 11.6)</p>
<p>EUTYCHES: Unknown; the comparison with SATYRON does not help us
identify him. (10.31)</p>
<p>EUTYCHION: Not certainly identified, unless the name is a slip for
the grammarian Eutychius Proculus. (10.31)</p>
<p>FABIUS: Unidentified, perhaps identical with FABIUS CATULLINUS.
(4.50)</p>
<p>FABIUS CATULLINUS: Unknown. Perhaps to be identified with the FABIUS
of 4.50. (12.27)</p>
<p>FAUSTINA: Wife of ANTONINUS Pius (8.25). Marcus married their
daughter, also Faustina (1.17).</p>
<p>FRONTO: Marcus Cornelius Fronto (c. 95–c. 166), rhetorician from
Cirta in North Africa, and a key figure in Marcus’s education. Portions
of his letters to Marcus survive in two palimpsest manuscripts
discovered in the early nineteenth century. (1.11)</p>
<p>HADRIAN (1): Prominent rhetorician; no relation to the emperor.
(8.25)</p>
<p>HADRIAN (2): Roman emperor (117–138), best known for his travels and
cultural interests; adopted ANTONINUS as his heir on the condition that
the latter adopt Marcus and Lucius VERUS. (4.33, 8.5, 8.37, 10.27)</p>
<p>HELVIDIUS: Helvidius Priscus (died c. 75), son-in-law of THRASEA
Paetus, exiled and later executed for his opposition to the emperor
VESPASIAN. (1.14)</p>
<p>HERACLITUS: Pre-Socratic philosopher (active c. 500 B.C.) from the
city of Ephesus, famous for his cryptic and paradoxical utterances. His
exaltation of the logos as a cosmic power and his identification of fire
as the primal substance were important influences on the Stoics (see
also Introduction). According to the third-century A.D. biographer
Diogenes Laertius, he died of dropsy, which he tried to cure by
immersing himself in manure; this account is almost certainly a later
fiction. (3.3, 6.47, 8.3; quoted or paraphrased 4.46, 6.42)</p>
<p>HIPPARCHUS: Second-century B.C. Greek astronomer. (6.47)</p>
<p>HIPPOCRATES: Greek doctor active in the fifth century B.C.; various
medical writings are transmitted under his name, as is the Hippocratic
Oath still administered to doctors. (3.3)</p>
<p>HYMEN: Unknown; the comparison with SATYRON does not help identify
him. (10.31)</p>
<p>JULIAN: This may be a friend of FRONTO’s, Claudius Julianus, a
proconsul of Asia at about this period. (4.50)</p>
<p>LEPIDUS: This might perhaps be the Roman aristocrat who briefly
shared power with Marcus Antonius and the future emperor AUGUSTUS, but
the context suggests an older contemporary of Marcus’s. (4.50)</p>
<p>LUCILLA: Marcus’s mother (d. 155/161). (1.3, 1.17, 8.25, 9.21)</p>
<p>LUSIUS LUPUS: Unknown. (12.27)</p>
<p>MAECENAS: Adviser and unofficial minister of culture to AUGUSTUS;
patron of the poets Vergil and Horace, among others. (8.31)</p>
<p>MARCIANUS: Unknown philosopher. (1.6)</p>
<p>MAXIMUS: Claudius Maximus. Roman consul in the early 140s. Governor
of Upper Pannonia in the early 150s. Later in that decade he governed
North Africa, where he served as judge in the trial of the novelist
Apuleius for sorcery. (1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 8.25)</p>
<p>MENIPPUS: Cynic philosopher (early third century B.C.) from Gadara in
Syria. He features as a character in many of the satirical dialogues of
Lucian. (6.47)</p>
<p>MONIMUS: Fourth-century B.C. Cynic philosopher and student of
DIOGENES. (2.15)</p>
<p>NERO: Roman emperor (54–68); his name was a byword for tyranny and
cruelty. (3.16)</p>
<p>ORIGANION: Unknown; most likely an imperial slave or freedman.
(6.47)</p>
<p>PANTHEIA: Mistress of Lucius VERUS, mentioned in several works by the
satirist Lucian. (8.37)</p>
<p>PERDICCAS: King of Macedon (c. 450–413 B.C.). (11.25)</p>
<p>PERGAMOS: Evidently an associate of Lucius VERUS, perhaps a slave or
lover. (8.37)</p>
<p>PHALARIS: Sixth-century B.C. dictator of Agrigento in Sicily,
notorious for his cruelty. (3.16)</p>
<p>PHILIP: King of Macedon (359–336 B.C.) and father of ALEXANDER THE
GREAT. (9.29, 10.27)</p>
<p>PHILISTION: Unknown, most likely an imperial slave or freedman,
though a contemporary mime writer of this name is also known. (6.47)</p>
<p>PHOCION: Athenian general and statesman of the fourth century B.C. He
was eventually sentenced to death for treason, and before his execution
supposedly asked his son to forgive the Athenians for condemning him.
(11.13)</p>
<p>PHOEBUS: Unknown, most likely an imperial slave or freedman.
(6.47)</p>
<p>PLATO: Athenian philosopher (c. 429–347 B.C.), disciple of SOCRATES
and author of philosophical dialogues in which the latter is portrayed
debating with his disciples and other contemporary figures. The most
famous of these is perhaps the Republic, in which he envisions an ideal
society. (7.48, 9.29, 10.23; quoted 7.44–46)</p>
<p>POMPEY: Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (106–48 B.C.), Roman politician and
general who rose to power in the 60s on the basis of a series of
successful campaigns in the East. His brief political alliance with
Julius CAESAR gave way to mutual rivalry and suspicion. When Caesar’s
march on Rome precipitated civil war in 49, Pompey led the senatorial
resistance. Following his defeat at the battle of Pharsalus, he fled to
Egypt, where he was murdered. (3.3, 8.3; family 8.31)</p>
<p>PYTHAGORAS: Greek mathematician, philosopher, and mystic of the late
sixth century B.C. He founded a religious community in southern Italy
whose members were known especially for their devotion to music and
geometry. (6.47; compare 11.27)</p>
<p>RUSTICUS: Quintus Junius Rusticus, twice consul and city prefect of
Rome in the mid-160s. His influence on Marcus is attested by the
Historia Augusta, although the reference to him in 1.17 suggests that
their relationship had its ups and downs. (1.7, 1.17)</p>
<p>SATYRON: Unknown, though evidently a contemporary of Marcus.
(10.31)</p>
<p>SCIPIO: Either Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (c. 235–183 B.C.),
who defeated Hannibal in the Second Punic War, or his grandson by
adoption, Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus (185/4–129 B.C.), the
conqueror of Carthage in the Third Punic War. (4.33)</p>
<p>SECUNDA: Wife of MAXIMUS. (8.25)</p>
<p>SEVERUS (1): Lucius Catilius Severus, Marcus’s great-grandfather.
(1.4)</p>
<p>SEVERUS (2): Gnaeus Claudius Severus Arabianus from Pompeiopolis in
Asia Minor, consul in 146; his son (perhaps the Severus of 10.31)
married one of Marcus’s daughters. He was an adherent of the Peripatetic
school, which traced its heritage back to Aristotle. (1.14)</p>
<p>SEXTUS: Sextus of Chaeronea, Stoic philosopher, teacher of both
Marcus and Lucius VERUS, and nephew of the great biographer and
antiquarian Plutarch. (1.9)</p>
<p>SILVANUS: Perhaps Lamia Silvanus, a son-in-law of Marcus. (10.31)</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Athenian philosopher (469–399 B.C.), teacher of PLATO. He
spent most of his life in his native city, and served with distinction
in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta. Although associated with
several members of the aristocratic junta that ruled Athens after its
defeat in 404, he refused to participate in their atrocities. He was
executed by the Athenians on a charge of impiety following the
restoration of democracy; Plato’s Apology purports to give his speech at
the trial. (1.16, 3.3, 3.6, 6.47, 7.19, 7.66, 8.3, 11.23, 11.25, 11.28,
11.39)</p>
<p>SOCRATICUS: Unknown; the comparison with SATYRON does not help
identify him. (10.31)</p>
<p>STERTINIUS: Not certainly identified. Tacitus mentions an army
officer of this name in the reign of Tiberius. But the reference to
Baiae (a Roman resort on the Bay of Naples) suggests a more likely
candidate a generation or so later: the wealthy Neapolitan physician
Quintus Stertinius, mentioned by Pliny the Elder (Natural History 29.7).
(12.27)</p>
<p>TANDASIS: Philosopher mentioned along with one Marcianus; neither is
otherwise known. Some have suggested a scribe’s error for Basilides,
listed among Marcus’s teachers by other sources. (1.6)</p>
<p>TELAUGES: Apparently a lesser disciple of SOCRATES, unless the
reference is to the son of PYTHAGORAS by this name. (7.66)</p>
<p>THEODOTUS: Unknown, but he and BENEDICTA were most likely household
slaves. (1.17)</p>
<p>THEOPHRASTUS: Philosopher (c. 371–c. 287 B.C.) who succeeded
Aristotle as head of the Peripatetic school. (2.10)</p>
<p>THRASEA: Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus (d. 66), Roman aristocrat
(consul 56) and father-in-law of HELVIDIUS Priscus. His opposition to
the regime of NERO (by whom he was eventually forced to commit suicide)
was informed by Stoic philosophy and in particular by the example of the
younger CATO (2), of whom he wrote a biography. (1.14)</p>
<p>TIBERIUS: Roman emperor (14–37) who succeeded AUGUSTUS. Late in his
reign he withdrew to a private estate on the island of Capri; his
alleged excesses there are recorded in the biography of him by
Suetonius. (12.27)</p>
<p>TRAJAN: Marcus Ulpius Traianus, Roman general and emperor (98–117).
(4.32)</p>
<p>TROPAEOPHORUS: Perhaps a contemporary senator named in an inscription
from Perinthus. (10.31)</p>
<p>VELIUS RUFUS: Addressee of one of FRONTO’s letters, but otherwise
unknown. (12.27)</p>
<p>VERUS (1): Marcus Annius Verus (d. 138), grandfather of Marcus. He
was three times consul (the last two in 121 and 126); he also served as
city prefect of Rome about this time. After the death of his wife he
evidently took a concubine who helped raise Marcus. (1.1, 1.17,
9.21)</p>
<p>VERUS (2): Marcus Annius Verus, father of Marcus and husband of
LUCILLA. He died sometime between 130 and 135. (1.2, 8.25)</p>
<p>VERUS (3): Lucius Aurelius Verus (130–169), son of HADRIAN (2)’s
intended successor, Lucius Aelius. Originally named Lucius Ceionius
Commodus, he was adopted along with Marcus by Antoninus Pius and on
Antoninus’s death became co-emperor with Marcus. He was entrusted with
the conduct of the Parthian War, and campaigned with Marcus on the
northern frontier before his sudden death on the way back to Rome.
(1.17, 8.37)</p>
<p>VESPASIAN: Roman emperor (69–79). His reign represented a period of
stability after the power struggle that followed the death of NERO, but
he came into conflict with some members of the senatorial class, notably
the Stoic HELVIDIUS Priscus. (4.32)</p>
<p>VOLESUS: Traditional surname in the Valerius clan, which produced a
number of figures prominent in early historical accounts. Which one
Marcus has in mind is uncertain. (4.33)</p>
<p>XANTHIPPE: Wife of SOCRATES and proverbially a shrew. (11.28)</p>
<p>XENOCRATES: Platonic philosopher and head of the Academy at the end
of the fourth century B.C. (6.13)</p>
<p>XENOPHON: Probably a contemporary doctor mentioned by Galen.
(10.31)</p>
<p>ZEUS: Sky god and head of the Greek pantheon; Marcus refers to him
only rarely and normally prefers a vaguer formulation such as “God” or
“the gods.” (4.23, 5.7, 5.8, 11.8)</p>
