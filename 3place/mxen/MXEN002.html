<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Gregory Hays</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</p>
<p>States will never be happy until rulers become philosophers or
philosophers become rulers.</p>
<p>—PLATO, The Republic</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius is said to have been fond of quoting Plato’s dictum,
and those who have written about him have rarely been able to resist
applying it to Marcus himself. And indeed, if we seek Plato’s
philosopher-king in the flesh we could hardly do better than Marcus, the
ruler of the Roman Empire for almost two decades and author of the
immortal Meditations. Yet the title is one that Marcus himself would
surely have rejected. He never thought of himself as a philosopher. He
would have claimed to be, at best, a diligent student and a very
imperfect practitioner of a philosophy developed by others. As for the
imperial throne, that came almost by accident. When Marcus Annius Verus
was born, in A.D. 121, bystanders might have predicted a distinguished
career in the Senate or the imperial administration. They could hardly
have guessed that he was destined for the imperial purple, or seen in
their mind’s eye the lonely bronze horseman whose upraised hand greets
us from the Capitoline hill in Rome across two thousand years.</p>
<p>Marcus sprang from a distinguished enough family. The year of his
birth coincided with his grandfather’s second tenure of the consulship,
in theory Rome’s highest office, though now of largely ceremonial
importance. And it was to be his grandfather who brought him up, for his
father died when he was very young. Marcus makes reference in the
Meditations to his father’s character as he remembered it or heard of it
from others, but his knowledge must have been more from stories than
from actual memories. Of the remainder of his childhood and his early
adolescence we know little more than can be gleaned from the
Meditations. The biography of him in the so-called Historia Augusta (a
curious and unreliable work of the late fourth century probably based on
a lost series of lives by the third-century biographer Marius Maximus)
tells us that he was a serious child, but also that he loved boxing,
wrestling, running and falconry, that he was a good ballplayer and that
he loved to hunt. None of these are surprising occupations in an
upper-class youth.</p>
<p>Book 1 of the Meditations offers glimpses of Marcus’s schooling, and
we can fill out the picture by what is known of upper-class education
generally at this period. His first instructors, like the unnamed
teacher mentioned in Meditations 1.5, were probably slaves, from whom he
would have mastered the rudiments of reading and writing. At a later
stage he would have been handed over to private tutors to be introduced
to literature, especially, no doubt, Vergil’s great epic, the Aeneid.
But literature served only as a preparation for the real goal. This was
rhetoric, the key to an active political career under the empire, as it
had been under the Republic. Under the supervision of a trained rhetor,
Marcus would have begun with short exercises before progressing to
full-scale practice declamations in which he would have been asked to
defend one side or another in imaginary law cases, or to advise a
prominent historical figure at a turning point in his career. (Should
Caesar cross the Rubicon? Should Alexander turn back at the Indus? Why
or why not?)</p>
<p>Such training was conducted in Greek as well as Latin. Since at least
the beginning of the first century B.C. the Roman upper classes had been
essentially bilingual, and Marcus’s spoken and written Greek would have
been as fluent as the French of a nineteenth-century Russian aristocrat
or the Chinese of a Heian Japanese courtier. Marcus would have read
Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey and the tragedies of Euripides side by side
with the Aeneid, and studied the speeches of the great Athenian orator
Demosthenes as intensively as those of the Roman statesman Cicero. It
was Greek writers and artists who constituted the intellectual elite at
the capital; when in later life the emperor conversed with his court
physician, Galen, he would have done so in the latter’s native tongue.
Above all, Greek remained overwhelmingly the language of philosophy. In
the late Republic and early empire, writers like Lucretius, Cicero and
Seneca had worked to create a philosophical literature in Latin, with
notable success. But the great thinkers—Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus,
Zeno, Chrysippus, Epicurus, etc.—had all been Greeks. Serious
philosophical investigation required a familiarity with the language
they wrote in and the terminology they developed. That Marcus composed
his own Meditations in Greek is natural enough.</p>
<p>In 137, when Marcus was sixteen, a crucial event took place. The
reigning emperor, Hadrian, was childless. An illness had brought him
near to death a year previously, and it was clear that he would not live
forever. Hadrian owed his throne to his adoption by his predecessor and
distant relative, Trajan. Following Trajan’s example, Hadrian had
designated the distinguished aristocrat Lucius Ceionius Commodus to
succeed him. In 137, however, Ceionius died unexpectedly, and Hadrian
was forced to cast about for a new successor. His choice fell on the
childless senator Antoninus, whom he selected with the proviso that
Antoninus should in turn adopt Marcus (his nephew by marriage) along
with Ceionius’s son Lucius Verus, then aged seven. Marcus took on the
family name of his adopted father, becoming Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus.</p>
<p>Hadrian’s death the following year left Marcus first in line for the
throne. His education and that of the younger Verus were now matters of
still greater concern, and it is clear that no expense was spared. For
training in Greek rhetoric, he was entrusted to Herodes Atticus, a
fabulously wealthy Athenian rhetorician whose tempestuous relations with
his family, fellow citizens and the imperial court itself would have
furnished ample material for a soap opera. His instructor in Latin
oratory was Marcus Cornelius Fronto, a prominent rhetorician from Cirta
in North Africa. By an accident of fate, many of Fronto’s letters to
Marcus have survived, and they illustrate the close relationship between
student and teacher. They also suggest Fronto’s regret at seeing Marcus
move away from rhetoric to delve ever more deeply into philosophy. The
first book of the Meditations pays tribute to a number of philosophers
from whom Marcus learned, both formally and informally, and he is likely
to have studied with or listened to many others.</p>
<p>Marcus would have learned much outside the classroom as well. For
training in legal and political matters, an informal apprenticeship
bound aristocratic youths to older public figures—men like Junius
Rusticus, whose influence Marcus chronicles in 1.7. But the single
greatest influence was surely Marcus’s adopted father, Antoninus Pius.
Marcus would have watched as Antoninus received embassies, tried legal
cases and dictated letters to his deputies. Meanwhile Marcus’s own
position as heir apparent was signaled in various ways. In 140 he served
as consul (at the age of nineteen), and would serve again in 145. In the
same year he married Antoninus’s daughter Faustina, to whom he pays
tribute in Meditations 1.17.</p>
<p>Edward Gibbon’s History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
describes the reign of Antoninus as “furnishing very few materials for
history, which is indeed little more than the register of the crimes,
follies, and misfortunes of mankind.” It furnishes equally little
material for Marcus’s biography. In the decade and a half between 145
and 161 we learn little of Marcus’s occupations, and our only glimpses
of his inner development come from his correspondence with Fronto. But
the two poles that would govern the remainder of his life—the court and
philosophy—seem by this point to be fully established. There is no
evidence that Marcus experienced anything like the “conversion” to
philosophy that some ancient figures experienced (or affected), but it
is clear that by the middle to late 140s philosophy was becoming
increasingly central to his life.</p>
<p>On August 31, 161, Antoninus died, leaving Marcus as his sole
successor. Marcus immediately acted to carry out what appears to have
been Hadrian’s original intention (perhaps ignored by Antoninus) by
pushing through the appointment of his adopted brother, Lucius Verus, as
co-regent. Verus’s character has suffered by comparison with Marcus’s.
Ancient sources, in particular the gossipy Historia Augusta, tend to
paint him as a self-indulgent degenerate—almost another Nero. This may
be unfair; it is certainly not the picture of him we get from Marcus’s
own reminiscences in the Meditations. It does seem clear, however, that
Marcus functioned as the senior emperor in fact if not name. It would be
surprising if he had not. He was almost a decade older, and had been
trained for the position by Antoninus himself.</p>
<p>What kind of ruler did this philosopher-king prove to be? Not,
perhaps, as different from his predecessors as one might have expected.
Though an emperor was all-powerful in theory, his ability to control
policy was in reality much more limited. Much of his time was spent
fielding problems that had moved up the administrative ladder: receiving
embassies from the large cities of the empire, trying appeals of
criminal cases, answering queries from provincial governors and dealing
with petitions from individuals. Even with a functional system of
imperial couriers, news could take weeks to travel from the periphery of
the empire to the center; imperial edicts took time to move down the
chain of command. While the emperor’s decision had the force of law,
enforcement was almost entirely in the hands of provincial governors,
whose diligence might be affected by incompetence, corruption, or an
understandable desire not to antagonize local elites.</p>
<p>We get occasional glimpses of Marcus’s day-to-day duties from the
evidence of imperial decisions preserved in letters, inscriptions and
the legal codes. Surviving legislation shows a certain interest in the
freeing of slaves and in regulations relating to the guardianship of
orphans. Attempts have been made to tie the first to Marcus’s
philosophical convictions and the second to his own memories of life
without a father. But it remains unclear how much of the policy is due
to Marcus himself, and how far it differs from that of Marcus’s
predecessor, Antoninus. Perhaps more interesting are the traces of
Marcus’s personality to be discerned in the phrasing of imperial
documents, where we find a scrupulous attention to detail and a
self-consciousness about linguistic usage that seems to differentiate
Marcus from his predecessors. Neither trait surprises in the author of
the Meditations or a student of Fronto, whose extant letters place great
stress on the quest for the mot juste.</p>
<p>One of Marcus’s priorities was to preserve good relations with the
Senate. The goal was to disguise the absoluteness with which the emperor
ruled: to preserve a facade—and sometimes, no doubt, even to achieve the
reality—of consensus and cooperation. A hundred years before,
aristocrats might have dreamed of a restored Republic (as some certainly
did). But by the second century it was clear that there was no
alternative to the principate. The Senate expected deference in public
and hoped for influence behind the scenes; “good” emperors were willing
to play along. In cultivating the upper classes Marcus was following in
the footsteps of Antoninus and Trajan, rather than of Hadrian, whose
relations with the Senate had been prickly. And it is this, as much as
anything else, that is responsible for his reputation as a benevolent
statesman. An emperor might do as he liked while he lived, but it was
the senatorial historians—men like Cornelius Tacitus in the 120s or
Cassius Dio in the generation after Marcus’s death—who had the last
word.</p>
<p>Another area where Marcus’s policy continued that of his predecessors
related to a small and eccentric sect known as the Christians. In the
course of the next century they would become an increasing problem for
the imperial administration, and they were prominent enough in Marcus’s
day to attract an extended denunciation from a certain Celsus, part of
whose work “Against the Christians” still survives. The sect met with
contempt from those intellectuals who deigned to take notice of it
(Marcus’s tutor Fronto was evidently one), and with suspicion and
hostility from ordinary citizens and administrators. The Christians’
disfavor stemmed from their failure to acknowledge the gods worshipped
by the community around them. Their “atheism”—their refusal to accept
any god but their own—endangered their neighbors as well as themselves,
and their reluctance to acknowledge the divine status of the emperor
threatened the social order and the well-being of the state.</p>
<p>Christianity had been illegal since the early second century when a
query from Pliny the Younger (then governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor)
prompted the emperor Trajan to establish a formal policy: While
Christians were not to be sought out, those who confessed to the faith
were to be executed. But empire-wide persecution did not become a
reality until a much later date. The main threat to Christians in the
second century came from individual provincial governors, acting either
on their own initiative or under pressure from local communities. In the
late 170s, for example, civic unrest at Lyons resulted in a virtual
pogrom of Greek-speaking Christians resident there. Marcus’s mentor
Junius Rusticus had tried and executed Christians (the apologist Justin
Martyr among them) in his capacity as city prefect. Marcus himself was
no doubt aware of Christianity, but there is no reason to think that it
bulked large in his mind. The one direct reference to it in the
Meditations (11.3) is almost certainly a later interpolation, and the
implicit references some scholars have discerned are surely
illusory.</p>
<p>Marcus, in any case, had more serious concerns than this troublesome
cult. Soon after his accession, relations between Rome and its only
rival, the Parthian empire in the East, took a dramatic turn for the
worse. Since at least the time of Trajan the two states had been locked
in a cold war that would continue for the next two centuries, and that
once a generation or so flared up into a military conflict. The death of
Antoninus and the accession of two new and untried rulers may have
tempted the Parthian ruler Vologaeses III to test the waters. In 162 his
forces occupied Armenia and wiped out a Roman garrison that had gone to
the rescue. Syria itself was threatened. Rome had no choice but to
respond.</p>
<p>It was Verus, the younger emperor, who was sent east, where he
remained for the next four years. Neither he nor Marcus had any military
experience to speak of (Antoninus’s peaceful reign had given little
scope for it), and the day-to-day conduct of the war was no doubt left
to the professionals. After initial setbacks the Romans rallied and,
under such commanders as the dynamic young Avidius Cassius, forced the
Parthians to sue for peace. Parthia would remain a threat, but one that
could be dealt with by diplomatic means for the immediate future.</p>
<p>Verus and his senior colleague had no time to bask in their triumph,
however. Within a year the empire was in the grip of a devastating
plague, apparently brought back from the East by Lucius’s troops. Its
effects may not have been quite as apocalyptic as later writers suggest,
but the death toll was certainly high, and it also delayed the emperors’
response to a second threat. This was the increasing instability on the
empire’s other border, the northern frontier that separated Rome from
the barbarian peoples of Germany, eastern Europe and Scandinavia. During
this period a number of these tribes were under pressure from peoples
farther north and reacted by moving across the empire’s borders—not for
conquest, but in search of land to settle. Rome’s reaction alternated
between aggressive resistance and attempts at accommodation; its failure
to develop a workable policy would eventually result in the collapse of
the Western empire some three centuries later.</p>
<p>In some places a line could be drawn. Hadrian’s great wall,
stretching across Britain, was intended to secure the empire’s most
distant frontier; under Antoninus it had been briefly superseded by a
second line farther to the north. But such fortifications were
impracticable on the continent, and it was there that the threat was
concentrated. Rome still remembered the catastrophe of A.D. 9, when the
Roman general Varus and three legions had marched into the forests of
Germany, never to return. In the second century, the greatest source of
anxiety was the area farther south, roughly corresponding to modern-day
Romania and Hungary. Trajan’s conquest of Dacia two generations before
had cleared out a possible source of trouble, but the potential for
friction remained. In Marcus’s day three peoples presented a special
problem: the Quadi, the Marcomanni, and the Jazyges, also called
Sarmatians. The removal of three legions to Parthia had seriously
weakened the Roman position on the northern frontier, and barbarians
took advantage of the situation. In 168, Marcus and Verus marched north
to deal with them.</p>
<p>Much of the remainder of the reign would be spent on intermittent
warfare, first in the so-called Marcomannic Wars of the early 170s and
then in a second campaign later in that decade. And most of the burden
was to be borne by Marcus alone, for Verus died suddenly (apparently of
a stroke) in early 169. It was a very different kind of war than the
traditional campaign Verus’s armies had waged. The conventional military
and diplomatic tactics that worked against the Parthians were of limited
use here. Instead, the Romans had to negotiate with individual
chieftains whose authority was limited and whose reliability was always
in doubt. When negotiation failed, the only alternative was a slow and
bloody succession of small-scale engagements rather than pitched
battles. The progress of the campaign is recorded on the column erected
in Rome to commemorate the close of the Marcomannic Wars. In spite of
its triumphal purpose, the engraved scenes that spiral around the
monument paint a grim picture of brutal fighting, devastation and
execution. “Spiders are proud of catching flies,” Marcus notes
mordantly, “men of catching hares, fish in a net, boars, bears,
Sarmatians” (10.10). The gruesome vignette that opens Meditations 8.34
(“a severed hand or foot, or a decapitated head”) may well reflect
Marcus’s own experience.</p>
<p>By 175 the Romans seemed to have gained the upper hand. But at this
point disturbing news arrived. Avidius Cassius, who had distinguished
himself as a general during the Parthian War and who as governor of
Syria now served as virtual regent of the Eastern empire, had revolted
and declared himself emperor. Some of the Eastern provinces (notably
Cappadocia) remained loyal to Marcus, but Cassius was recognized as
emperor throughout much of the East, and in particular in Egypt, whose
grain supply was crucial to the capital. Civil war seemed inevitable,
and was prevented only by Cassius’s assassination at the hands of a
subordinate. Marcus was nevertheless obliged to travel east to reassert
his authority, taking with him Faustina (who died in the course of the
journey). He visited the major cities of the East, Antioch and
Alexandria, arriving finally at Athens, where he was initiated into the
Eleusinian Mysteries, a set of mystic rites connected with the worship
of Demeter, the goddess of agriculture.</p>
<p>Now in his fifties, Marcus was in declining health, and the revolt of
Cassius had only underlined the need to make arrangements for the
succession. Faustina had borne at least thirteen children, many of whom
had died young. By the mid-170s, Marcus had only one surviving son,
Commodus, just entering his teens. There was no reason for Marcus to
continue the policy of adoption followed by his predecessors, and there
is no reason to think he even considered it. The years that follow see
Commodus’s rapid promotion to a position not far short of co-emperor. He
was consul in 177 at the age of fifteen. In the same year he was
accorded all the major imperial privileges, except for the post of
Pontifex Maximus, the head of the Roman state religion, held by the
reigning emperor alone, and for life.</p>
<p>The gains of the Marcomannic Wars had not proved permanent, and in
178, Marcus and Commodus marched north again. Two years later Marcus
died at age fifty-eight, the first emperor to pass on the throne to his
son since Vespasian a century before. Sadly, Commodus’s performance did
not bear out whatever promise Marcus had discerned in him. He was to be
remembered as a dissolute tyrant, a second Caligula or Nero whose many
defects were only emphasized by the contrast with his father. His
assassination after a twelve-year reign would usher in the first in a
series of power struggles that would burden the empire for the next
century.</p>
