<h4 id="book-10">Book 10</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>To my soul:</li>
</ol>
<p>Are you ever going to achieve goodness? Ever going to be simple,
whole, and naked—as plain to see as the body that contains you? Know
what an affectionate and loving disposition would feel like? Ever be
fulfilled, ever stop desiring—lusting and longing for people and things
to enjoy? Or for more time to enjoy them? Or for some other place or
country—“a more temperate clime”? Or for people easier to get along
with? And instead be satisfied with what you have, and accept the
present—all of it. And convince yourself that everything is the gift of
the gods, that things are good and always will be, whatever they decide
and have in store for the preservation of that perfect entity—good and
just and beautiful, creating all things, connecting and embracing them,
and gathering in their separated fragments to create more like them.</p>
<p>Will you ever take your stand as a fellow citizen with gods and human
beings, blaming no one, deserving no one’s censure?</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Focus on what nature demands, as if you were governed by that alone.
Then do that, and accept it, unless your nature as a living being would
be degraded by it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then focus on what that nature demands, and accept that too—unless
your nature as a rational being would be degraded by it.</p>
<p>And, of course, “rational” also implies “civic.”</p>
<p>Follow these guidelines and don’t waste time on anything else.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Everything that happens is either endurable or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining.</p>
<p>If it’s unendurable . . . then stop complaining. Your destruction
will mean its end as well.</p>
<p>Just remember: you can endure anything your mind can make endurable,
by treating it as in your interest to do so.</p>
<p>In your interest, or in your nature.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>If they’ve made a mistake, correct them gently and show them
where they went wrong. If you can’t do that, then the blame lies with
you. Or no one.</p></li>
<li><p>Whatever happens to you has been waiting to happen since the
beginning of time. The twining strands of fate wove both of them
together: your own existence and the things that happen to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether it’s atoms or nature, the first thing to be said is this:
I am a part of a world controlled by nature. Secondly: that I have a
relationship with other, similar parts. And with that in mind I have no
right, as a part, to complain about what is assigned me by the whole.
Because what benefits the whole can’t harm the parts, and the whole does
nothing that doesn’t benefit it. That’s a trait shared by all natures,
but the nature of the world is defined by a second characteristic as
well: no outside force can compel it to cause itself harm.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So by keeping in mind the whole I form a part of, I’ll accept
whatever happens. And because of my relationship to other parts, I will
do nothing selfish, but aim instead to join them, to direct my every
action toward what benefits us all and to avoid what doesn’t. If I do
all that, then my life should go smoothly. As you might expect a
citizen’s life to go—one whose actions serve his fellow citizens, and
who embraces the community’s decree.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>The whole is compounded by nature of individual parts, whose
destruction is inevitable (“destruction” here meaning transformation).
If the process is harmful to the parts and unavoidable, then it’s hard
to see how the whole can run smoothly, with parts of it passing from one
state to another, all of them built only to be destroyed in different
ways. Does nature set out to cause its own components harm, and make
them vulnerable to it—indeed, predestined to it? Or is it oblivious to
what goes on? Neither one seems very plausible.</li>
</ol>
<p>But suppose we throw out “nature” and explain these things through
inherent properties. It would still be absurd to say that the individual
things in the world are inherently prone to change, and at the same time
be astonished at it or complain—on the grounds that it was happening
“contrary to nature.” And least of all when things return to the state
from which they came. Because our elements are either simply dispersed,
or are subject to a kind of gravitation—the solid portions being pulled
toward earth, and what is ethereal drawn into the air, until they’re
absorbed into the universal logos—which is subject to periodic
conflagrations, or renewed through continual change.</p>
<p>And don’t imagine either that those elements—the solid ones and the
ethereal—are with us from our birth. Their influx took place yesterday,
or the day before—from the food we ate, the air we breathed.</p>
<p>And that’s what changes—not the person your mother gave birth to.</p>
<p>—But if you’re inextricably linked to it through your sense of
individuality?</p>
<p>That’s not what we’re talking about here.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Epithets for yourself: Upright. Modest. Straightforward. Sane.
Cooperative. Disinterested.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try not to exchange them for others.</p>
<p>And if you should forfeit them, set about getting them back.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that “sanity” means understanding things—each individual
thing—for what they are. And not losing the thread.</p>
<p>And “cooperation” means accepting what nature assigns you—accepting
it willingly.</p>
<p>And “disinterest” means that the intelligence should rise above the
movements of the flesh—the rough and the smooth alike. Should rise above
fame, above death, and everything like them.</p>
<p>If you maintain your claim to these epithets—without caring if others
apply them to you or not—you’ll become a new person, living a new life.
To keep on being the person that you’ve been—to keep being mauled and
degraded by the life you’re living—is to be devoid of sense and much too
fond of life. Like those animal fighters at the games—torn half to
pieces, covered in blood and gore, and still pleading to be held over
till tomorrow . . . to be bitten and clawed again.</p>
<p>Set sail, then, with this handful of epithets to guide you. And steer
a steady course, if you can. Like an emigrant to the islands of the
blest. And if you feel yourself adrift—as if you’ve lost control—then
hope for the best, and put in somewhere where you can regain it. Or
leave life altogether, not in anger, but matter-of-factly,
straightforwardly, without arrogance, in the knowledge that you’ve at
least done that much with your life.</p>
<p>And as you try to keep these epithets in mind, it will help you a
great deal to keep the gods in mind as well. What they want is not
flattery, but for rational things to be like them. For figs to do what
figs were meant to do—and dogs, and bees . . . and people.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Operatics, combat and confusion. Sloth and servility. Every day they
blot out those sacred principles of yours—which you daydream
thoughtlessly about, or just let slide.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your actions and perceptions need to aim:</p>
<p>• at accomplishing practical ends</p>
<p>• at the exercise of thought</p>
<p>• at maintaining a confidence founded on understanding. An
unobtrusive confidence—hidden in plain sight.</p>
<p>When will you let yourself enjoy straightforwardness? Seriousness? Or
understanding individual things—their nature and substance, their place
in the world, their life span, their composition, who can possess them,
whose they are to give and to receive?</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>Spiders are proud of catching flies, men of catching hares, fish in
a net, boars, bears, Sarmatians . . .</li>
</ol>
<p>Criminal psychology.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>How they all change into one another—acquire the ability to see
that. Apply it constantly; use it to train yourself. Nothing is as
conducive to spiritual growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>11a. He has stripped away his body and—realizing that at some point
soon he will have to abandon mankind and leave all this behind—has
dedicated himself to serving justice in all he does, and nature in all
that happens. What people say or think about him, or how they treat him,
isn’t something he worries about. Only these two questions: Is what he’s
doing now the right thing to be doing? Does he accept and welcome what
he’s been assigned? He has stripped away all other occupations, all
other tasks. He wants only to travel a straight path—to God, by way of
law.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>Why all this guesswork? You can see what needs to be done. If you
can see the road, follow it. Cheerfully, without turning back. If not,
hold up and get the best advice you can. If anything gets in the way,
forge on ahead, making good use of what you have on hand, sticking to
what seems right. (The best goal to achieve, and the one we fall short
of when we fail.)</li>
</ol>
<p>12a. To follow the logos in all things is to be relaxed and
energetic, joyful and serious at once.</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>When you wake up, ask yourself:</li>
</ol>
<p>Does it make any difference to you if other people blame you for
doing what’s right?</p>
<p>It makes no difference.</p>
<p>Have you forgotten what the people who are so vociferous in praise or
blame of others are like as they sleep and eat? Forgotten their
behavior, their fears, their desires, their thefts and depredations—not
physical ones, but those committed by what should be highest in them?
What creates, when it chooses, loyalty, humility, truth, order,
well-being.</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li><p>Nature gives and nature takes away. Anyone with sense and
humility will tell her, “Give and take as you please,” not out of
defiance, but out of obedience and goodwill.</p></li>
<li><p>Only a short time left. Live as if you were alone—out in the
wilderness. No difference between here and there: the city that you live
in is the world.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let people see someone living naturally, and understand what that
means. Let them kill him if they can’t stand it. (Better than living
like this.)</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li><p>To stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be
one.</p></li>
<li><p>Continual awareness of all time and space, of the size and life
span of the things around us. A grape seed in infinite space. A half
twist of a corkscrew against eternity.</p></li>
<li><p>Bear in mind that everything that exists is already fraying at
the edges, and in transition, subject to fragmentation and to
rot.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Or that everything was born to die.</p>
<ol start="19" type="1">
<li><p>How they act when they eat and sleep and mate and defecate and
all the rest. Then when they order and exult, or rage and thunder from
on high. And yet, just consider the things they submitted to a moment
ago, and the reasons for it—and the things they’ll submit to again
before very long.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of us needs what nature gives us, when nature gives
it.</p></li>
<li><p>“The earth knows longing for the rain, the sky/knows longing . .
.” And the world longs to create what will come to be. I tell it “I
share your longing.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(And isn’t that what we mean by “inclined to happen”?)</p>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li>Possibilities:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>To keep on living (you should be used to it by now)</p></li>
<li><p>To end it (it was your choice, after all)</p></li>
<li><p>To die (having met your obligations)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Those are the only options. Reason for optimism.</p>
<ol start="23" type="1">
<li><p>Keep always before you that “this is no different from an empty
field,” and the things in it are the same as on a mountaintop, on the
seashore, wherever. Plato gets to the heart of it: “fencing a sheepfold
in the mountains, and milking goats or sheep.”</p></li>
<li><p>My mind. What is it? What am I making of it? What am I using it
for?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Is it empty of thought?</p>
<p>Isolated and torn loose from those around it?</p>
<p>Melted into flesh and blended with it, so that it shares its
urges?</p>
<ol start="25" type="1">
<li>When a slave runs away from his master, we call him a fugitive
slave. But the law of nature is a master too, and to break it is to
become a fugitive.</li>
</ol>
<p>To feel grief, anger or fear is to try to escape from something
decreed by the ruler of all things, now or in the past or in the future.
And that ruler is law, which governs what happens to each of us. To feel
grief or anger or fear is to become a fugitive—a fugitive from
justice.</p>
<ol start="26" type="1">
<li>He deposits his sperm and leaves. And then a force not his takes it
and goes to work, and creates a child.</li>
</ol>
<p>This . . . from that?</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>He pours food down his throat. And then a force not his takes it and
creates sensations, desires, daily life, physical strength and so much
else besides.</p>
<p>To look at these things going on silently and see the force that
drives them. As we see the force that pushes things and pulls them. Not
with our eyes, but just as clearly.</p>
<ol start="27" type="1">
<li><p>To bear in mind constantly that all of this has happened before.
And will happen again—the same plot from beginning to end, the identical
staging. Produce them in your mind, as you know them from experience or
from history: the court of Hadrian, of Antoninus. The courts of Philip,
Alexander, Croesus. All just the same. Only the people
different.</p></li>
<li><p>People who feel hurt and resentment: picture them as the pig at
the sacrifice, kicking and squealing all the way.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Like the man alone in his bed, silently weeping over the chains that
bind us.</p>
<p>That everything has to submit. But only rational beings can do so
voluntarily.</p>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li><p>Stop whatever you’re doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I
afraid of death because I won’t be able to do this anymore?</p></li>
<li><p>When faced with people’s bad behavior, turn around and ask when
you have acted like that. When you saw money as a good, or pleasure, or
social position. Your anger will subside as soon as you recognize that
they acted under compulsion (what else could they do?).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Or remove the compulsion, if you can.</p>
<ol start="31" type="1">
<li>When you look at Satyron, see Socraticus, or Eutyches, or
Hymen.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you look at Euphrates, see Eutychion or Silvanus.</p>
<p>With Alciphron, see Tropaeophorus.</p>
<p>When you look at Xenophon, see Crito or Severus.</p>
<p>When you look at yourself, see any of the emperors.</p>
<p>And the same with everyone else. Then let it hit you: Where are they
now?</p>
<p>Nowhere . . . or wherever.</p>
<p>That way you’ll see human life for what it is. Smoke. Nothing.
Especially when you recall that once things alter they cease to exist
through all the endless years to come.</p>
<p>Then why such turmoil? To live your brief life rightly, isn’t that
enough?</p>
<p>The raw material you’re missing, the opportunities . . . ! What is
any of this but training—training for your logos, in life observed
accurately, scientifically.</p>
<p>So keep at it, until it’s fully digested. As a strong stomach digests
whatever it eats. As a blazing fire takes whatever you throw on it, and
makes it light and flame.</p>
<ol start="32" type="1">
<li><p>That no one can say truthfully that you are not a straightforward
or honest person. That anyone who thinks that believes a falsehood. The
responsibility is all yours; no one can stop you from being honest or
straightforward. Simply resolve not to go on living if you aren’t. It
would be contrary to the logos.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the material we’re made of, what’s the sanest thing that we
can do or say? Whatever it may be, you can do or say it. Don’t pretend
that anything’s stopping you.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll never stop complaining until you feel the same pleasure that
the hedonist gets from self-indulgence—only from doing what’s proper to
human beings as far as circumstances—inherent or fortuitous—allow.
“Enjoyment” means doing as much of what your nature requires as you can.
And you can do that anywhere. A privilege not granted to a cylinder—to
determine its own action. Or to water, or fire, or any of the other
things governed by nature alone, or by an irrational soul. Too many
things obstruct them and get in their way. But the intellect and logos
are able to make their way through anything in their path—by inborn
capacity or sheer force of will. Keep before your eyes the ease with
which they do this—the ease with which the logos is carried through all
things, as fire is drawn upward or a stone falls to earth, as a cylinder
rolls down an inclined plane.</p>
<p>That’s all you need. All other obstacles either affect the lifeless
body, or have no power to shake or harm anything unless misperception
takes over or the logos surrenders voluntarily. Otherwise those they
obstruct would be degraded by them immediately. In all other entities,
when anything bad happens to them, it affects them for the worse.
Whereas here a person is improved by it (if I can put it like that)—and
we admire him for reacting as a person should.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that nothing can harm one of nature’s citizens
except what harms the city he belongs to. And nothing harms that city
except what harms its law. And there is no so-called misfortune that can
do that. So long as the law is safe, so is the city—and the citizen.</p>
<ol start="34" type="1">
<li>If you’ve immersed yourself in the principles of truth, the
briefest, most random reminder is enough to dispel all fear and
pain:</li>
</ol>
<p>. . . leaves that the wind</p>
<p>Drives earthward; such are the generations of men.</p>
<p>Your children, leaves.</p>
<p>Leaves applauding loyally and heaping praise upon you, or turning
around and calling down curses, sneering and mocking from a safe
distance.</p>
<p>A glorious reputation handed down by leaves.</p>
<p>All of these “spring up in springtime”—and the wind blows them all
away. And the tree puts forth others to replace them.</p>
<p>None of us have much time. And yet you act as if things were
eternal—the way you fear and long for them. . . .</p>
<p>Before long, darkness. And whoever buries you mourned in their
turn.</p>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li>A healthy pair of eyes should see everything that can be seen and
not say, “No! Too bright!” (which is a symptom of ophthalmia).</li>
</ol>
<p>A healthy sense of hearing or smell should be prepared for any sound
or scent; a healthy stomach should have the same reaction to all foods,
as a mill to what it grinds.</p>
<p>So too a healthy mind should be prepared for anything. The one that
keeps saying, “Are my children all right?” or “Everyone must approve of
me” is like eyes that can only stand pale colors, or teeth that can
handle only mush.</p>
<ol start="36" type="1">
<li>It doesn’t matter how good a life you’ve led. There’ll still be
people standing around the bed who will welcome the sad event.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even with the intelligent and good. Won’t there be someone thinking
“Finally! To be through with that old schoolteacher. Even though he
never said anything, you could always feel him judging you.” And that’s
for a good man. How many traits do you have that would make a lot of
people glad to be rid of you?</p>
<p>Remember that, when the time comes. You’ll be less reluctant to leave
if you can tell yourself, “This is the sort of life I’m leaving. Even
the people around me, the ones I spent so much time fighting for,
praying over, caring about—even they want me gone, in hopes that it will
make their own lives easier. How could anyone stand a longer stay
here?”</p>
<p>And yet, don’t leave angry with them. Be true to who you are: caring,
sympathetic, kind. And not as if you were being torn away from life. But
the way it is when someone dies peacefully, how the soul is released
from the body—that’s how you should leave them. It was nature that bound
you to them—that tied the knot. And nature that now unties you.</p>
<p>I am released from those around me. Not dragged against my will, but
unresisting.</p>
<p>There are things that nature demands. And this is one of them.</p>

<li>Learn to ask of all actions, “Why are they doing that?”</li>

<p>Starting with your own.</p>

<li>Remember that what pulls the strings is within—hidden from us. Is
speech, is life, is the person. Don’t conceive of the rest as part of
it—the skin that contains it, and the accompanying organs. Which are
tools—like a carpenter’s axe, except that they’re attached to us from
birth, and are no more use without what moves and holds them still than
the weaver’s shuttle, the writer’s pencil, the driver’s whip.</li>
