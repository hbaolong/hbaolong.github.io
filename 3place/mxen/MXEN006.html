<h4 id="other-influences">Other Influences</h4>
<p>Marcus Aurelius is often thought of and referred to as the
quintessential Stoic. Yet the only explicit reference to Stoicism in the
Meditations (5.10) is phrased in curiously distant terms, as if it were
merely one school among others. The great figures of early Stoicism are
conspicuous by their absence. Neither Zeno nor Cleanthes is mentioned in
the Meditations, and Chrysippus appears only twice—quoted once in
passing for a pithy comparison (6.42) and included with Socrates and
Epictetus in a list of dead thinkers (7.19). This is not to deny the
essentially Stoic basis of Marcus’s thought, or the deep influence on
him exercised by later Stoic thinkers (most obviously Epictetus). If he
had to be identified with a particular school, that is surely the one he
would have chosen. Yet I suspect that if asked what it was that he
studied, his answer would have been not “Stoicism” but simply
“philosophy.”</p>
<p>There is nothing surprising about this. The imperial period saw the
development of a widespread ecumenical tendency in philosophy. Adherents
of most of the major schools—the Platonists, Peripatetics, Cynics, and
Stoics—preferred to focus on the points they shared, rather than those
that separated them. Not all the figures Marcus credits as influential
on his own philosophical development were Stoics; Severus, for example,
was a Peripatetic. Although authors like Seneca and Epictetus accepted
the basic premises of the system developed by Zeno and Chrysippus, they
showed no reluctance to borrow aphorisms, anecdotes, and argumentative
strategies from non-Stoic sources. The Meditations follows a similar
procedure. While built on a Stoic foundation, it also refers to and
quotes a wide range of figures, both precursors of the Stoics and
representatives of rival schools.</p>
<p>Of the predecessors Marcus invokes, the most important is surely
Socrates, the great Athenian thinker who had helped redirect philosophy
from a preoccupation with the physical world to a focus on the role of
man in society and the nature of human morality. Socrates himself wrote
nothing. His teachings were transmitted (and greatly elaborated) in the
philosophical dialogues of his student Plato. Marcus quotes Plato
repeatedly (especially in Book 7), and Socratic or Platonic elements can
be discerned elsewhere too. One example is the so-called Socratic
paradox, the claim that no one does wrong willingly, and that if men
were able to recognize what is right, they would inevitably do it. “They
are like this,” Marcus says of other people, “because they can’t tell
good from evil” (2.1), and he repeats this assertion elsewhere.</p>
<p>Socrates’ character was as important as his doctrines. His legendary
endurance and self-denial made him an ideal model for the Stoic
philosopher—or any philosopher. His refusal to compromise his
philosophical beliefs led him to make the ultimate sacrifice when he was
put on trial at the age of seventy on trumped-up charges of impiety. His
display of integrity at the trial and his comportment in the days
leading up to his execution made it easy to view him as a forerunner of
first-century Stoic martyrs like Thrasea Paetus or Helvidius Priscus,
and it is in this light that Marcus evokes him in Meditations 7.66.</p>
<p>Of Socrates’ predecessors (the so-called pre-Socratic thinkers), the
most important, both for Marcus and the Stoics generally, was
Heraclitus, the mysterious figure from Ephesus (in modern-day Turkey)
whose Zenlike aphorisms were proverbial for their profundity and
obscurity alike. Heraclitus’s philosophical system ascribed a central
role to logos and to fire as the primordial element. Both elements were
naturally congenial to the Stoics, and may well have influenced them.
Heraclitus is mentioned in a handful of entries in the Meditations
(4.46, 6.47), but his doctrines can be traced in many others. Moreover,
his concision and epigrammatic phrasing anticipate the kind of enigmatic
apothegm we find in a number of entries:</p>
<p>The best revenge is not to be like that. (6.6)</p>
<p>Straight, not straightened. (7.12)</p>
<p>The fencer’s weapon is picked up and put down again. The boxer’s is
part of him. (12.9)</p>
<p>It is from Heraclitus that Marcus derives one of his most memorable
motifs, that of the unstable flux of time and matter in which we move.
“We cannot step twice into the same river,” Heraclitus had said, and we
see Marcus expanding on the observation: “Time is a river, a violent
current of events, glimpsed once and already carried past us, and
another follows and is gone” (4.43; and compare 2.17, 6.15).</p>
<p>Though Heraclitus was clearly the pre-Socratic who most influenced
Marcus, other thinkers leave traces as well. Marcus twice borrows the
poet Empedocles’ image of the self-contained soul as a perfect sphere
(8.41, 12.3), and he alludes once to the mystic doctrines of the
Pythagoreans (11.27). Several entries explore the implications of
phrases attributed to Democritus, one of the inventors of the theory of
atoms, which would later inspire the Hellenistic philosopher
Epicurus.</p>
<p>Neither Heraclitus nor Socrates had founded a school. That was an
achievement reserved for Plato, and then for Plato’s student Aristotle,
who broke from his master to found the Peripatetic movement. Marcus
never refers to Aristotle, though he does quote approvingly from the
latter’s successor Theophrastus (2.10). Probably more important was
another fourth-century B.C. movement: Cynicism. The Cynics, of whom the
first and most notorious was the irascible Diogenes of Sinope, were
united less by doctrine than by a common attitude, namely their contempt
for societal institutions and a desire for a life more in accord with
nature. Diogenes himself was largely responsible for the image of a
philosopher as an impoverished ascetic (the “philosopher without
clothes” evoked by Marcus at Meditations 4.30 might well be a Cynic).
His famous claim to be a “citizen of the world” surely anticipates, if
it did not actually influence, the Stoic conception of the world as a
city-state. Marcus refers to Diogenes in several passages, as well as to
the latter’s student Monimus (2.15), and invokes another Cynic, Crates,
at Meditations 6.13, in an anecdote whose tenor is now uncertain.</p>
<p>Marcus’s relationship to Epicureanism, Stoicism’s great rival among
Hellenistic philosophical systems, is much more vexed. The followers of
Epicurus (341–270 B.C.) believed in a universe radically unlike that
posited by Zeno and Chrysippus. The Stoic world is ordered to the nth
degree; the Epicurean universe is random, the product of the haphazard
conjunctions of billions of atoms. To speak of Providence in such a
world is transparently absurd, and while Epicurus acknowledged the
existence of gods, he denied that they took any interest in human life.
As for humans, our role is simply to live as best we can, making the
most of what pleasures are available to us and insulating ourselves as
far as possible from pain and anxiety. In particular, we are to feel no
anxiety about death, which consists simply in the dissolution of our
component atoms. This process is not only inevitable, but harmless, for
the simple reason that after death there is no “us” to suffer harm.</p>
<p>Although the sect numbered not a few prominent Romans among its
adherents, it never attained the success of Stoicism, and was regarded
with genial contempt by most outsiders. The quietism endorsed by the
Epicureans was obviously difficult to reconcile with an active public
life—an important Roman value—and the Epicurean equation of the good
with pleasure was bound to raise eyebrows among conservative Romans.
“Eat, drink and be merry” was popularly supposed to be the Epicureans’
motto, though Epicurus himself had been quite explicit in identifying
pleasure with intellectual contemplation rather than the vulgar
enjoyment of food and sex. Though a minority view, Epicureanism was,
nonetheless, the only potential rival to Stoicism in offering a
systematic cosmology, as Marcus acknowledges on a number of occasions by
the stark dichotomy “Providence or atoms” (4.3, 10.6, 11.18, 12.14).</p>
<p>Marcus normally seems to view Epicureanism with disapproval (as we
would expect). In Meditations 6.10 he contrasts the Epicurean universe,
founded on “mixture, interaction, dispersal” with the components of the
Stoic system: “unity, order, design”—clearly to the advantage of the
latter. Should we not be ashamed to fear death, he asks in another
entry, when “even” the Epicureans disdain it? (12.34). But other entries
suggest a less dismissive attitude. Marcus quotes with apparent approval
Epicurus’s account of his own exemplary conduct during an illness (9.41)
and twice seeks comfort in the philosopher’s remarks on the endurance of
pain (7.33, 7.64). Like other late Stoics (Seneca is a notable example),
he was willing to accept truth wherever he found it.</p>
<p>Thus far we have been concerned with the content of the Meditations:
the ethical doctrine of late Stoicism, incorporating a certain amount of
Platonic and Heraclitean material, and overlaid with occasional
reference to other schools and thinkers. But what of the Meditations
itself? How and why was it written? Who is its audience? What kind of
book is it? For the answers to these questions we must turn from the
book’s content to its form and origins.</p>
