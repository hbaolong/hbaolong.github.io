<h4 id="book-11">Book 11</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Characteristics of the rational soul:</li>
</ol>
<p>Self-perception, self-examination, and the power to make of itself
whatever it wants.</p>
<p>It reaps its own harvest, unlike plants (and, in a different way,
animals), whose yield is gathered in by others.</p>
<p>It reaches its intended goal, no matter where the limit of its life
is set. Not like dancing and theater and things like that, where the
performance is incomplete if it’s broken off in the middle, but at any
point—no matter which one you pick—it has fulfilled its mission, done
its work completely. So that it can say, “I have what I came for.”</p>
<p>It surveys the world and the empty space around it, and the way it’s
put together. It delves into the endlessness of time to extend its grasp
and comprehension of the periodic births and rebirths that the world
goes through. It knows that those who come after us will see nothing
different, that those who came before us saw no more than we do, and
that anyone with forty years behind him and eyes in his head has seen
both past and future—both alike.</p>
<p>Also characteristic of the rational soul:</p>
<p>Affection for its neighbors. Truthfulness. Humility. Not to place
anything above itself—which is characteristic of law as well. No
difference here between the logos of rationality and that of
justice.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>To acquire indifference to pretty singing, to dancing, to the
martial arts: Analyze the melody into the notes that form it, and as you
hear each one, ask yourself whether you’re powerless against that. That
should be enough to deter you.</li>
</ol>
<p>The same with dancing: individual movements and tableaux. And the
same with the martial arts.</p>
<p>And with everything—except virtue and what springs from it. Look at
the individual parts and move from analysis to indifference.</p>
<p>Apply this to life as a whole.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The resolute soul:</li>
</ol>
<p>Resolute in separation from the body. And then in dissolution or
fragmentation—or continuity.</p>
<p>But the resolution has to be the result of its own decision, not just
in response to outside forces [like the Christians]. It has to be
considered and serious, persuasive to other people. Without
dramatics.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Have I done something for the common good? Then I share in the
benefits.</li>
</ol>
<p>To stay centered on that. Not to give up.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>“And your profession?” “Goodness.” (And how is that to be
achieved, except by thought—about the world, about the nature of
people?)</p></li>
<li><p>First, tragedies. To remind us of what can happen, and that it
happens inevitably—and if something gives you pleasure on that stage, it
shouldn’t cause you anger on this one. You realize that these are things
we all have to go through, and that even those who cry aloud “o Mount
Cithaeron!” have to endure them. And some excellent lines as well.
These, for example:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If I and my two children cannot move the gods</p>
<p>The gods must have their reasons</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>And why should we feel anger at the world?</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>To harvest life like standing stalks of grain</p>
<p>and a good many others.</p>
<p>Then, after tragedy, Old Comedy: instructive in its frankness, its
plain speaking designed to puncture pretensions. (Diogenes used the same
tactic for similar ends.)</p>
<p>Then consider the Middle (and later the New) Comedy and what it aimed
at—gradually degenerating into mere realism and empty technique. There
are undeniably good passages, even in those writers, but what was the
point of it all—the script and staging alike?</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>It stares you in the face. No role is so well suited to
philosophy as the one you happen to be in right now.</p></li>
<li><p>A branch cut away from the branch beside it is simultaneously cut
away from the whole tree. So too a human being separated from another is
cut loose from the whole community.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The branch is cut off by someone else. But people cut themselves
off—through hatred, through rejection—and don’t realize that they’re
cutting themselves off from the whole civic enterprise.</p>
<p>Except that we also have a gift, given us by Zeus, who founded this
community of ours. We can reattach ourselves and become once more
components of the whole.</p>
<p>But if the rupture is too often repeated, it makes the severed part
hard to reconnect, and to restore. You can see the difference between
the branch that’s been there since the beginning, remaining on the tree
and growing with it, and the one that’s been cut off and grafted
back.</p>
<p>“One trunk, two minds.” As the gardeners put it.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>As you move forward in the logos, people will stand in your way.
They can’t keep you from doing what’s healthy; don’t let them stop you
from putting up with them either. Take care on both counts. Not just
sound judgments, solid actions—tolerance as well, for those who try to
obstruct us or give us trouble in other ways.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because anger, too, is weakness, as much as breaking down and giving
up the struggle. Both are deserters: the man who breaks and runs, and
the one who lets himself be alienated from his fellow humans.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>The natural can never be inferior to the artificial; art imitates
nature, not the reverse. In which case, that most highly developed and
comprehensive nature—Nature itself—cannot fall short of artifice in its
craftsmanship.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, all the arts move from lower goals to higher ones. Won’t Nature
do the same?</p>
<p>Hence justice. Which is the source of all the other virtues. For how
could we do what justice requires if we are distracted by things that
don’t matter, if we are naive, gullible, inconstant?</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>It’s the pursuit of these things, and your attempts to avoid them,
that leave you in such turmoil. And yet they aren’t seeking you out; you
are the one seeking them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suspend judgment about them. And at once they will lie still, and you
will be freed from fleeing and pursuing.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p>The soul as a sphere in equilibrium: Not grasping at things
beyond it or retreating inward. Not fragmenting outward, not sinking
back on itself, but ablaze with light and looking at the truth, without
and within.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone despises me.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s their problem.</p>
<p>Mine: not to do or say anything despicable.</p>
<p>Someone hates me. Their problem.</p>
<p>Mine: to be patient and cheerful with everyone, including them. Ready
to show them their mistake. Not spitefully, or to show off my own
self-control, but in an honest, upright way. Like Phocion (if he wasn’t
just pretending). That’s what we should be like inside, and never let
the gods catch us feeling anger or resentment.</p>
<p>As long as you do what’s proper to your nature, and accept what the
world’s nature has in store—as long as you work for others’ good, by any
and all means—what is there that can harm you?</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li><p>They flatter one another out of contempt, and their desire to
rule one another makes them bow and scrape.</p></li>
<li><p>The despicable phoniness of people who say, “Listen, I’m going to
level with you here.” What does that mean? It shouldn’t even need to be
said. It should be obvious—written in block letters on your forehead. It
should be audible in your voice, visible in your eyes, like a lover who
looks into your face and takes in the whole story at a glance. A
straightforward, honest person should be like someone who stinks: when
you’re in the same room with him, you know it. But false
straightforwardness is like a knife in the back.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>False friendship is the worst. Avoid it at all costs. If you’re
honest and straightforward and mean well, it should show in your eyes.
It should be unmistakable.</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>To live a good life:</li>
</ol>
<p>We have the potential for it. If we can learn to be indifferent to
what makes no difference. This is how we learn: by looking at each
thing, both the parts and the whole. Keeping in mind that none of them
can dictate how we perceive it. They don’t impose themselves on us. They
hover before us, unmoving. It is we who generate the
judgments—inscribing them on ourselves. And we don’t have to. We could
leave the page blank—and if a mark slips through, erase it
instantly.</p>
<p>Remember how brief is the attentiveness required. And then our lives
will end.</p>
<p>And why is it so hard when things go against you? If it’s imposed by
nature, accept it gladly and stop fighting it. And if not, work out what
your own nature requires, and aim at that, even if it brings you no
glory.</p>
<p>None of us is forbidden to pursue our own good.</p>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li><p>Source and substance of each thing. What it changes into, and
what it’s like transformed; that nothing can harm it.</p></li>
<li><ol type="i">
<li>My relationship to them. That we came into the world for the sake of
one another. Or from another point of view, I came into it to be their
guardian—as the ram is of the flock, and the bull of the herd.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Start from this: if not atoms, then Nature—directing everything. In
that case, lower things for the sake of higher ones, and higher ones for
one another.</p>
<ol start="2" type="i">
<li><p>What they’re like eating, in bed, etc. How driven they are by
their beliefs. How proud they are of what they do.</p></li>
<li><p>That if they’re right to do this, then you have no right to
complain. And if they aren’t, then they do it involuntarily, out of
ignorance. Because all souls are prevented from treating others as they
deserve, just as they are kept from truth: unwillingly. Which is why
they resent being called unjust, or arrogant, or greedy—any suggestion
that they aren’t good neighbors.</p></li>
<li><p>That you’ve made enough mistakes yourself. You’re just like
them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Even if there are some you’ve avoided, you have the potential.</p>
<p>Even if cowardice has kept you from them. Or fear of what people
would say. Or some equally bad reason.</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>That you don’t know for sure it is a mistake. A lot of things are
means to some other end. You have to know an awful lot before you can
judge other people’s actions with real understanding.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" type="i">
<li><p>When you lose your temper, or even feel irritated: that human
life is very short. Before long all of us will be laid out side by
side.</p></li>
<li><p>That it’s not what they do that bothers us: that’s a problem for
their minds, not ours. It’s our own misperceptions. Discard them. Be
willing to give up thinking of this as a catastrophe . . . and your
anger is gone. How do you do that? By recognizing that you’ve suffered
no disgrace. Unless disgrace is the only thing that can hurt you, you’re
doomed to commit innumerable offenses—to become a thief, or heaven only
knows what else.</p></li>
<li><p>How much more damage anger and grief do than the things that
cause them.</p></li>
<li><p>That kindness is invincible, provided it’s sincere—not ironic or
an act. What can even the most vicious person do if you keep treating
him with kindness and gently set him straight—if you get the
chance—correcting him cheerfully at the exact moment that he’s trying to
do you harm. “No, no, my friend. That isn’t what we’re here for. It
isn’t me who’s harmed by that. It’s you.” And show him, gently and
without pointing fingers, that it’s so. That bees don’t behave like
this—or any other animals with a sense of community. Don’t do it
sardonically or meanly, but affectionately—with no hatred in your heart.
And not ex cathedra or to impress third parties, but speaking directly.
Even if there are other people around.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Keep these nine points in mind, like gifts from the nine Muses, and
start becoming a human being. Now and for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>And along with not getting angry at others, try not to pander either.
Both are forms of selfishness; both of them will do you harm. When you
start to lose your temper, remember: There’s nothing manly about rage.
It’s courtesy and kindness that define a human being—and a man. That’s
who possesses strength and nerves and guts, not the angry whiners. To
react like that brings you closer to impassivity—and so to strength.
Pain is the opposite of strength, and so is anger. Both are things we
suffer from, and yield to.</p>
<p>. . . and one more thought, from Apollo:</p>
<ol start="24" type="a">
<li>That to expect bad people not to injure others is crazy. It’s to ask
the impossible. And to let them behave like that to other people but
expect them to exempt you is arrogant—the act of a tyrant.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="19" type="1">
<li>Four habits of thought to watch for, and erase from your mind when
you catch them. Tell yourself:</li>
</ol>
<p>• This thought is unnecessary.</p>
<p>• This one is destructive to the people around you.</p>
<p>• This wouldn’t be what you really think (to say what you don’t
think—the definition of absurdity).</p>
<p>And the fourth reason for self-reproach: that the more divine part of
you has been beaten and subdued by the degraded mortal part—the body and
its stupid self-indulgence.</p>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li>Your spirit and the fire contained within you are drawn by their
nature upward. But they comply with the world’s designs and submit to
being mingled here below. And the elements of earth and water in you are
drawn by their nature downward. But are forced to rise, and take up a
position not their own. So even the elements obey the world—when ordered
and compelled—and man their stations until the signal to abandon them
arrives.</li>
</ol>
<p>So why should your intellect be the only dissenter—the only one
complaining about its posting? It’s not as if anything is being forced
on it. Only what its own nature requires. And yet it refuses to comply,
and sets off in the opposite direction. Because to be drawn toward what
is wrong and self-indulgent, toward anger and fear and pain, is to
revolt against nature. And for the mind to complain about anything that
happens is to desert its post. It was created to show reverence—respect
for the divine—no less than to act justly. That too is an element of
coexistence and a prerequisite for justice.</p>
<ol start="21" type="1">
<li>“If you don’t have a consistent goal in life, you can’t live it in a
consistent way.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Unhelpful, unless you specify a goal.</p>
<p>There is no common benchmark for all the things that people think are
good—except for a few, the ones that affect us all. So the goal should
be a common one—a civic one. If you direct all your energies toward
that, your actions will be consistent. And so will you.</p>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li><p>The town mouse and the country mouse. Distress and agitation of
the town mouse.</p></li>
<li><p>Socrates used to call popular beliefs “the monsters under the
bed”—only useful for frightening children with.</p></li>
<li><p>At festivals the Spartans put their guests’ seats in the shade,
but sat themselves down anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Socrates declining Perdiccas’s invitation “so as to avoid dying a
thousand deaths” (by accepting a favor he couldn’t pay back).</p></li>
<li><p>This advice from Epicurean writings: to think continually of one
of the men of old who lived a virtuous life.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pythagoreans tell us to look at the stars at daybreak. To
remind ourselves how they complete the tasks assigned them—always the
same tasks, the same way. And their order, purity, nakedness. Stars wear
no concealment.</p></li>
<li><p>Socrates dressed in a towel, the time Xanthippe took his cloak
and went out. The friends who were embarrassed and avoided him when they
saw him dressed like that, and what Socrates said to them.</p></li>
<li><p>Mastery of reading and writing requires a master. Still more so
life.</p></li>
<li><p>“. . . For you/Are but a slave and have no claim to
logos.”</p></li>
<li><p>“But my heart rejoiced.”</p></li>
<li><p>“And jeer at virtue with their taunts and sneers.”</p></li>
<li><p>Stupidity is expecting figs in winter, or children in old
age.</p></li>
<li><p>As you kiss your son good night, says Epictetus, whisper to
yourself, “He may be dead in the morning.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t tempt fate, you say.</p>
<p>By talking about a natural event? Is fate tempted when we speak of
grain being reaped?</p>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li>Grapes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unripe . . . ripened . . . then raisins.</p>
<p>Constant transitions.</p>
<p>Not the “not” but the “not yet.”</p>
<ol start="36" type="1">
<li><p>“No thefts of free will reported.”[—Epictetus.]</p></li>
<li><p>“We need to master the art of acquiescence. We need to pay
attention to our impulses, making sure they don’t go unmoderated, that
they benefit others, that they’re worthy of us. We need to steer clear
of desire in any form and not try to avoid what’s beyond our
control.”</p></li>
<li><p>“This is not a debate about just anything,” he said, “but about
sanity itself.”</p></li>
<li><p>Socrates: What do you want, rational minds or irrational
ones?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>—Rational ones.</p>
<p>Healthy or sick?</p>
<p>—Healthy.</p>
<p>Then work to obtain them.</p>
<p>—We already have.</p>
<p>Then why all this squabbling?</p>
