<h4 id="book-3">Book 3</h4>
<p>IN CARNUNTUM</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Not just that every day more of our life is used up and less and
less of it is left, but this too: if we live longer, can we be sure our
mind will still be up to understanding the world—to the contemplation
that aims at divine and human knowledge? If our mind starts to wander,
we’ll still go on breathing, go on eating, imagining things, feeling
urges and so on. But getting the most out of ourselves, calculating
where our duty lies, analyzing what we hear and see, deciding whether
it’s time to call it quits—all the things you need a healthy mind for .
. . all those are gone.</li>
</ol>
<p>So we need to hurry.</p>
<p>Not just because we move daily closer to death but also because our
understanding—our grasp of the world—may be gone before we get
there.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>We should remember that even Nature’s inadvertence has its own
charm, its own attractiveness. The way loaves of bread split open on top
in the oven; the ridges are just by-products of the baking, and yet
pleasing, somehow: they rouse our appetite without our knowing why.</li>
</ol>
<p>Or how ripe figs begin to burst.</p>
<p>And olives on the point of falling: the shadow of decay gives them a
peculiar beauty.</p>
<p>Stalks of wheat bending under their own weight. The furrowed brow of
the lion. Flecks of foam on the boar’s mouth.</p>
<p>And other things. If you look at them in isolation there’s nothing
beautiful about them, and yet by supplementing nature they enrich it and
draw us in. And anyone with a feeling for nature—a deeper
sensitivity—will find it all gives pleasure. Even what seems
inadvertent. He’ll find the jaws of live animals as beautiful as painted
ones or sculptures. He’ll look calmly at the distinct beauty of old age
in men, women, and at the loveliness of children. And other things like
that will call out to him constantly—things unnoticed by others. Things
seen only by those at home with Nature and its works.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Hippocrates cured many illnesses—and then fell ill and died. The
Chaldaeans predicted the deaths of many others; in due course their own
hour arrived. Alexander, Pompey, Caesar—who utterly destroyed so many
cities, cut down so many thousand foot and horse in battle—they too
departed this life. Heraclitus often told us the world would end in
fire. But it was moisture that carried him off; he died smeared with
cowshit. Democritus was killed by ordinary vermin, Socrates by the human
kind.</li>
</ol>
<p>And?</p>
<p>You boarded, you set sail, you’ve made the passage. Time to
disembark. If it’s for another life, well, there’s nowhere without gods
on that side either. If to nothingness, then you no longer have to put
up with pain and pleasure, or go on dancing attendance on this battered
crate, your body—so much inferior to that which serves it.</p>
<p>One is mind and spirit, the other earth and garbage.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Don’t waste the rest of your time here worrying about other
people—unless it affects the common good. It will keep you from doing
anything useful. You’ll be too preoccupied with what so-and-so is doing,
and why, and what they’re saying, and what they’re thinking, and what
they’re up to, and all the other things that throw you off and keep you
from focusing on your own mind.</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything
random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important
or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that
if someone says, “What are you thinking about?” you can respond at once
(and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And it
would be obvious at once from your answer that your thoughts were
straightforward and considerate ones—the thoughts of an unselfish
person, one unconcerned with pleasure and with sensual indulgence
generally, with squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else
you’d be ashamed to be caught thinking.</p>
<p>Someone like that—someone who refuses to put off joining the elect—is
a kind of priest, a servant of the gods, in touch with what is within
him and what keeps a person undefiled by pleasures, invulnerable to any
pain, untouched by arrogance, unaffected by meanness, an athlete in the
greatest of all contests—the struggle not to be overwhelmed by anything
that happens. With what leaves us dyed indelibly by justice, welcoming
wholeheartedly whatever comes—whatever we’re assigned—not worrying too
often, or with any selfish motive, about what other people say. Or do,
or think.</p>
<p>He does only what is his to do, and considers constantly what the
world has in store for him—doing his best, and trusting that all is for
the best. For we carry our fate with us—and it carries us.</p>
<p>He keeps in mind that all rational things are related, and that to
care for all human beings is part of being human. Which doesn’t mean we
have to share their opinions. We should listen only to those whose lives
conform to nature. And the others? He bears in mind what sort of people
they are—both at home and abroad, by night as well as day—and who they
spend their time with. And he cares nothing for their praise—men who
can’t even meet their own standards.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>How to act:</li>
</ol>
<p>Never under compulsion, out of selfishness, without forethought, with
misgivings.</p>
<p>Don’t gussy up your thoughts.</p>
<p>No surplus words or unnecessary actions.</p>
<p>Let the spirit in you represent a man, an adult, a citizen, a Roman,
a ruler. Taking up his post like a soldier and patiently awaiting his
recall from life. Needing no oath or witness.</p>
<p>Cheerfulness. Without requiring other people’s help. Or serenity
supplied by others.</p>
<p>To stand up straight—not straightened.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>If, at some point in your life, you should come across anything
better than justice, honesty, self-control, courage—than a mind
satisfied that it has succeeded in enabling you to act rationally, and
satisfied to accept what’s beyond its control—if you find anything
better than that, embrace it without reservations—it must be an
extraordinary thing indeed—and enjoy it to the full.</li>
</ol>
<p>But if nothing presents itself that’s superior to the spirit that
lives within—the one that has subordinated individual desires to itself,
that discriminates among impressions, that has broken free of physical
temptations (as Socrates used to say), and subordinated itself to the
gods, and looks out for human beings’ welfare—if you find that there’s
nothing more important or valuable than that . . .</p>
<p>. . . then don’t make room for anything but it—for anything that
might lead you astray, tempt you off the road, and leave you unable to
devote yourself completely to achieving the goodness that is uniquely
yours. It would be wrong for anything to stand between you and attaining
goodness—as a rational being and a citizen. Anything at all: the
applause of the crowd, high office, wealth, or self-indulgence. All of
them might seem to be compatible with it—for a while. But suddenly they
control us and sweep us away.</p>
<p>So make your choice straightforwardly, once and for all, and stick to
it. Choose what’s best.</p>
<p>—Best is what benefits me.</p>
<p>As a rational being? Then follow through. Or just as an animal? Then
say so and stand your ground without making a show of it. (Just make
sure you’ve done your homework first.)</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Never regard something as doing you good if it makes you betray a
trust, or lose your sense of shame, or makes you show hatred, suspicion,
ill will, or hypocrisy, or a desire for things best done behind closed
doors. If you can privilege your own mind, your guiding spirit and your
reverence for its powers, that should keep you clear of dramatics, of
wailing and gnashing of teeth. You won’t need solitude—or a cast of
thousands, either. Above all, you’ll be free of fear and desire. And how
long your body will contain the soul that inhabits it will cause you not
a moment’s worry. If it’s time for you to go, leave willingly—as you
would to accomplish anything that can be done with grace and honor. And
concentrate on this, your whole life long: for your mind to be in the
right state—the state a rational, civic mind should be in.</p></li>
<li><p>The mind of one set straight and purified: no pus, no dirt, no
scabs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And not a life cut short by death, like an actor who stops before the
play is done, the plot wound up.</p>
<p>Neither servility nor arrogance. Neither cringing nor disdain.
Neither excuses nor evasions.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>Your ability to control your thoughts—treat it with respect. It’s
all that protects your mind from false perceptions—false to your nature,
and that of all rational beings. It’s what makes thoughtfulness
possible, and affection for other people, and submission to the
divine.</p></li>
<li><p>Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and remember it:
Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has been lived
already, or is impossible to see. The span we live is small—small as the
corner of the earth in which we live it. Small as even the greatest
renown, passed from mouth to mouth by short-lived stick figures,
ignorant alike of themselves and those long dead.</p></li>
<li><p>To the stand-bys above, add this one: always to define whatever
it is we perceive—to trace its outline—so we can see what it really is:
its substance. Stripped bare. As a whole. Unmodified. And to call it by
its name—the thing itself and its components, to which it will
eventually return. Nothing is so conducive to spiritual growth as this
capacity for logical and accurate analysis of everything that happens to
us. To look at it in such a way that we understand what need it
fulfills, and in what kind of world. And its value to that world as a
whole and to man in particular—as a citizen of that higher city, of
which all other cities are mere households.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>What is it—this thing that now forces itself on my notice? What is it
made up of? How long was it designed to last? And what qualities do I
need to bring to bear on it—tranquillity, courage, honesty,
trustworthiness, straightforwardness, independence or what?</p>
<p>So in each case you need to say: “This is due to God.” Or: “This is
due to the interweavings and intertwinings of fate, to coincidence or
chance.” Or: “This is due to a human being. Someone of the same race,
the same birth, the same society, but who doesn’t know what nature
requires of him. But I do. And so I’ll treat them as the law that binds
us—the law of nature—requires. With kindness and with justice.</p>
<p>And in inconsequential things? I’ll do my best to treat them as they
deserve.”</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>If you do the job in a principled way, with diligence, energy and
patience, if you keep yourself free of distractions, and keep the spirit
inside you undamaged, as if you might have to give it back at any
moment—</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can embrace this without fear or expectation—can find
fulfillment in what you’re doing now, as Nature intended, and in
superhuman truthfulness (every word, every utterance)—then your life
will be happy.</p>
<p>No one can prevent that.</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li><p>Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for
emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too—ready to understand heaven
and earth. In everything you do, even the smallest thing, remember the
chain that links them. Nothing earthly succeeds by ignoring heaven,
nothing heavenly by ignoring the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop drifting. You’re not going to re-read your Brief Comments,
your Deeds of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, the commonplace books you
saved for your old age. Sprint for the finish. Write off your hopes, and
if your well-being matters to you, be your own savior while you
can.</p></li>
<li><p>They don’t realize how much is included in stealing, sowing,
buying, resting, seeing to business (not with the eyes, but another kind
of sight).</p></li>
<li><p>Body. Soul. Mind.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Sensations: the body.</p>
<p>Desires: the soul.</p>
<p>Reasoning: the mind.</p>
<p>To experience sensations: even grazing beasts do that. To let your
desires control you: even wild animals do that—and rutting humans, and
tyrants (from Phalaris to Nero . . .).</p>
<p>To make your mind your guide to what seems best: even people who deny
the gods do that. Even people who betray their country. Even people who
do &lt;. . .&gt; behind closed doors.</p>
<p>If all the rest is common coin, then what is unique to the good
man?</p>
<p>To welcome with affection what is sent by fate. Not to stain or
disturb the spirit within him with a mess of false beliefs. Instead, to
preserve it faithfully, by calmly obeying God—saying nothing untrue,
doing nothing unjust. And if the others don’t acknowledge it—this life
lived with simplicity, humility, cheerfulness—he doesn’t resent them for
it, and isn’t deterred from following the road where it leads: to the
end of life. An end to be approached in purity, in serenity, in
acceptance, in peaceful unity with what must be.</p>
