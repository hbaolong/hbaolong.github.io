<h4 id="book-4">Book 4</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Our inward power, when it obeys nature, reacts to events by
accommodating itself to what it faces—to what is possible. It needs no
specific material. It pursues its own aims as circumstances allow; it
turns obstacles into fuel. As a fire overwhelms what would have quenched
a lamp. What’s thrown on top of the conflagration is absorbed, consumed
by it—and makes it burn still higher.</p></li>
<li><p>No random actions, none not based on underlying
principles.</p></li>
<li><p>People try to get away from it all—to the country, to the beach,
to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic:
you can get away from it anytime you like.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By going within.</p>
<p>Nowhere you can go is more peaceful—more free of interruptions—than
your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An
instant’s recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by
tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony.</p>
<p>So keep getting away from it all—like that. Renew yourself. But keep
it brief and basic. A quick visit should be enough to ward off all &lt;
. . . &gt; and send you back ready to face what awaits you.</p>
<p>What’s there to complain about? People’s misbehavior? But take into
consideration:</p>
<p>• that rational beings exist for one another;</p>
<p>• that doing what’s right sometimes requires patience;</p>
<p>• that no one does the wrong thing deliberately;</p>
<p>• and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and
fought and died and been buried.</p>
<p>. . . and keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p>Or are you complaining about the things the world assigns you? But
consider the two options: Providence or atoms. And all the arguments for
seeing the world as a city.</p>
<p>Or is it your body? Keep in mind that when the mind detaches itself
and realizes its own nature, it no longer has anything to do with
ordinary life—the rough and the smooth, either one. And remember all
you’ve been taught—and accepted—about pain and pleasure.</p>
<p>Or is it your reputation that’s bothering you? But look at how soon
we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The
emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us—how
capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all
takes place. The whole earth a point in space—and most of it
uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they
are.</p>
<p>So keep this refuge in mind: the back roads of your self. Above all,
no strain and no stress. Be straightforward. Look at things like a man,
like a human being, like a citizen, like a mortal. And among the things
you turn to, these two:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving,
outside it. Disturbance comes only from within—from our own
perceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>That everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think
of how many changes you’ve already seen.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>If thought is something we share, then so is reason—what makes us
reasoning beings.</li>
</ol>
<p>If so, then the reason that tells us what to do and what not to do is
also shared.</p>
<p>And if so, we share a common law.</p>
<p>And thus, are fellow citizens.</p>
<p>And fellow citizens of something.</p>
<p>And in that case, our state must be the world. What other entity
could all of humanity belong to? And from it—from this state that we
share—come thought and reason and law.</p>
<p>Where else could they come from? The earth that composes me derives
from earth, the water from some other element, the air from its own
source, the heat and fire from theirs—since nothing comes from nothing,
or returns to it.</p>
<p>So thought must derive from somewhere else as well.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Death: something like birth, a natural mystery, elements that split
and recombine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not an embarrassing thing. Not an offense to reason, or our
nature.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>That sort of person is bound to do that. You might as well resent
a fig tree for secreting juice. (Anyway, before very long you’ll both be
dead—dead and soon forgotten.)</p></li>
<li><p>Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p>It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character. Otherwise
it cannot harm you—inside or out.</p></li>
<li><p>It was for the best. So Nature had no choice but to do
it.</p></li>
<li><p>That every event is the right one. Look closely and you’ll
see.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Not just the right one overall, but right. As if someone had weighed
it out with scales.</p>
<p>Keep looking closely like that, and embody it in your actions:
goodness—what defines a good person.</p>
<p>Keep to it in everything you do.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p>Not what your enemy sees and hopes that you will, but what’s
really there.</p></li>
<li><p>Two kinds of readiness are constantly needed: (i) to do only what
the logos of authority and law directs, with the good of human beings in
mind; (ii) to reconsider your position, when someone can set you
straight or convert you to his. But your conversion should always rest
on a conviction that it’s right, or benefits others—nothing else. Not
because it’s more appealing or more popular.</p></li>
<li><p>You have a mind?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>—Yes.</p>
<p>Well, why not use it? Isn’t that all you want—for it to do its
job?</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>You have functioned as a part of something; you will vanish into
what produced you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Or be restored, rather.</p>
<p>To the logos from which all things spring.</p>
<p>By being changed.</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li><p>Many lumps of incense on the same altar. One crumbles now, one
later, but it makes no difference.</p></li>
<li><p>Now they see you as a beast, a monkey. But in a week they’ll
think you’re a god—if you rediscover your beliefs and honor the
logos.</p></li>
<li><p>Not to live as if you had endless years ahead of you. Death
overshadows you. While you’re alive and able—be good.</p></li>
<li><p>The tranquillity that comes when you stop caring what they say.
Or think, or do. Only what you do. (Is this fair? Is this the right
thing to do?)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&lt; . . . &gt; not to be distracted by their darkness. To run
straight for the finish line, unswerving.</p>
<ol start="19" type="1">
<li>People who are excited by posthumous fame forget that the people who
remember them will soon die too. And those after them in turn. Until
their memory, passed from one to another like a candle flame, gutters
and goes out.</li>
</ol>
<p>But suppose that those who remembered you were immortal and your
memory undying. What good would it do you? And I don’t just mean when
you’re dead, but in your own lifetime. What use is praise, except to
make your lifestyle a little more comfortable?</p>
<p>“ You’re out of step—neglecting the gifts of nature to hand on
someone’s words in the future. “</p>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li>Beautiful things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and
sufficient to themselves. Praise is extraneous. The object of praise
remains what it was—no better and no worse. This applies, I think, even
to “beautiful” things in ordinary life—physical objects, artworks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Does anything genuinely beautiful need supplementing? No more than
justice does—or truth, or kindness, or humility. Are any of those
improved by being praised? Or damaged by contempt? Is an emerald
suddenly flawed if no one admires it? Or gold, or ivory, or purple?
Lyres? Knives? Flowers? Bushes?</p>
<ol start="21" type="1">
<li>If our souls survive, how does the air find room for them—all of
them—since the beginning of time?</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the earth find room for all the bodies buried in it since
the beginning of time? They linger for whatever length of time, and
then, through change and decomposition, make room for others. So too
with the souls that inhabit the air. They linger a little, and then are
changed—diffused and kindled into fire, absorbed into the logos from
which all things spring, and so make room for new arrivals.</p>
<p>One possible answer.</p>
<p>But we shouldn’t think only of the mass of buried bodies. There are
the ones consumed, on a daily basis, by us and by other animals. How
many are swallowed up like that, entombed in the bodies of those
nourished by them, and yet there is room for them all—converted into
flesh and blood, transformed to air and fire.</p>
<p>How is the truth of this determined?</p>
<p>Through analysis: material and cause.</p>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li><p>Not to be driven this way and that, but always to behave with
justice and see things as they are.</p></li>
<li><p>To the world: Your harmony is mine. Whatever time you choose is
the right time. Not late, not early.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To nature: What the turn of your seasons brings me falls like ripe
fruit. All things are born from you, exist in you, return to you.</p>
<p>The poet says “dear city of Cecrops . . .” Can’t you bring yourself
to say “of Zeus”?</p>
<ol start="24" type="1">
<li>“If you seek tranquillity, do less.” Or (more accurately) do what’s
essential—what the logos of a social being requires, and in the
requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less,
better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can
eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself
at every moment, “Is this necessary?”</p>
<p>But we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To
eliminate the unnecessary actions that follow.</p>
<ol start="25" type="1">
<li><p>And then you might see what the life of the good man is
like—someone content with what nature assigns him, and satisfied with
being just and kind himself.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ve seen that. Now look at this.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t be disturbed. Uncomplicate yourself.</p>
<p>Someone has done wrong . . . to himself.</p>
<p>Something happens to you. Good. It was meant for you by nature, woven
into the pattern from the beginning.</p>
<p>Life is short. That’s all there is to say. Get what you can from the
present—thoughtfully, justly.</p>
<p>Unrestrained moderation.</p>
<ol start="27" type="1">
<li><p>An ordered world or a mishmash. But still an order. Can there be
order within you and not in everything else? In things so different, so
dispersed, so intertwined?</p></li>
<li><p>Character: dark, womanish, obstinate. Wolf, sheep, child, fool,
cheat, buffoon, salesman, tyrant.</p></li>
<li><p>Alien: (n.) one who doesn’t know what the world contains. Or how
it operates.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Fugitive: (n.) one who evades his obligations to others.</p>
<p>Blind: (adj.) one who keeps the eyes of his mind shut tight.</p>
<p>Poor: (adj.) requiring others; not having the necessities of life in
one’s own possession.</p>
<p>Rebel: (n.) one who is rebellious, one who withdraws from the logos
of Nature because he resents its workings. (It produced you; now it
produces this.)</p>
<p>Schismatic: (n.) one who separates his own soul from others with the
logos. They should be one.</p>
<ol start="30" type="1">
<li><p>A philosopher without clothes and one without books. “I have
nothing to eat,” says he, as he stands there half-naked, “but I subsist
on the logos.” And with nothing to read, I subsist on it too.</p></li>
<li><p>Love the discipline you know, and let it support you. Entrust
everything willingly to the gods, and then make your way through life—no
one’s master and no one’s slave.</p></li>
<li><p>The age of Vespasian, for example. People doing the exact same
things: marrying, raising children, getting sick, dying, waging war,
throwing parties, doing business, farming, flattering, boasting,
distrusting, plotting, hoping others will die, complaining about their
own lives, falling in love, putting away money, seeking high office and
power.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And that life they led is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Or the age of Trajan. The exact same things. And that life
too—gone.</p>
<p>Survey the records of other eras. And see how many others gave their
all and soon died and decomposed into the elements that formed them.</p>
<p>But most of all, run through the list of those you knew yourself.
Those who worked in vain, who failed to do what they should have—what
they should have remained fixed on and found satisfaction in.</p>
<p>A key point to bear in mind: The value of attentiveness varies in
proportion to its object. You’re better off not giving the small things
more time than they deserve.</p>
<ol start="33" type="1">
<li>Words once in common use now sound archaic. And the names of the
famous dead as well: Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus . . . Scipio and
Cato . . . Augustus . . . Hadrian and Antoninus, and . . .</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything fades so quickly, turns into legend, and soon oblivion
covers it.</p>
<p>And those are the ones who shone. The rest—“unknown, unasked-for” a
minute after death. What is “eternal” fame? Emptiness.</p>
<p>Then what should we work for?</p>
<p>Only this: proper understanding; unselfish action; truthful speech. A
resolve to accept whatever happens as necessary and familiar, flowing
like water from that same source and spring.</p>
<ol start="34" type="1">
<li><p>Hand yourself over to Clotho voluntarily, and let her spin you
into whatever she pleases.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything transitory—the knower and the known.</p></li>
<li><p>Constant awareness that everything is born from change. The
knowledge that there is nothing nature loves more than to alter what
exists and make new things like it. All that exists is the seed of what
will emerge from it. You think the only seeds are the ones that make
plants or children? Go deeper.</p></li>
<li><p>On the verge of dying and still weighed down, still turbulent,
still convinced external things can harm you, still rude to other
people, still not acknowledging the truth: that wisdom is
justice.</p></li>
<li><p>Look into their minds, at what the wise do and what they
don’t.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing that goes on in anyone else’s mind can harm you. Nor can
the shifts and changes in the world around you.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>—Then where is harm to be found?</p>
<p>In your capacity to see it. Stop doing that and everything will be
fine. Let the part of you that makes that judgment keep quiet even if
the body it’s attached to is stabbed or burnt, or stinking with pus, or
consumed by cancer. Or to put it another way: It needs to realize that
what happens to everyone—bad and good alike—is neither good nor bad.
That what happens in every life—lived naturally or not—is neither
natural nor unnatural.</p>
<ol start="40" type="1">
<li><p>The world as a living being—one nature, one soul. Keep that in
mind. And how everything feeds into that single experience, moves with a
single motion. And how everything helps produce everything else. Spun
and woven together.</p></li>
<li><p>“A little wisp of soul carrying a corpse.”—Epictetus.</p></li>
<li><p>There is nothing bad in undergoing change—or good in emerging
from it.</p></li>
<li><p>Time is a river, a violent current of events, glimpsed once and
already carried past us, and another follows and is gone.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything that happens is as simple and familiar as the rose in
spring, the fruit in summer: disease, death, blasphemy, conspiracy . . .
everything that makes stupid people happy or angry.</p></li>
<li><p>What follows coheres with what went before. Not like a random
catalogue whose order is imposed upon it arbitrarily, but logically
connected. And just as what exists is ordered and harmonious, what comes
into being betrays an order too. Not a mere sequence, but an astonishing
concordance.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember Heraclitus: “When earth dies, it becomes water; water,
air; air, fire; and back to the beginning.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Those who have forgotten where the road leads.”</p>
<p>“They are at odds with what is all around them”—the all-directing
logos. And “they find alien what they meet with every day.”</p>
<p>“Our words and actions should not be like those of sleepers” (for we
act and speak in dreams as well) “or of children copying their
parents”—doing and saying only what we have been told.</p>
<ol start="47" type="1">
<li><p>Suppose that a god announced that you were going to die tomorrow
“or the day after.” Unless you were a complete coward you wouldn’t kick
up a fuss about which day it was—what difference could it make? Now
recognize that the difference between years from now and tomorrow is
just as small.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t let yourself forget how many doctors have died, after
furrowing their brows over how many deathbeds. How many astrologers,
after pompous forecasts about others’ ends. How many philosophers, after
endless disquisitions on death and immortality. How many warriors, after
inflicting thousands of casualties themselves. How many tyrants, after
abusing the power of life and death atrociously, as if they were
themselves immortal.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>How many whole cities have met their end: Helike, Pompeii,
Herculaneum, and countless others.</p>
<p>And all the ones you know yourself, one after another. One who laid
out another for burial, and was buried himself, and then the man who
buried him—all in the same short space of time.</p>
<p>In short, know this: Human lives are brief and trivial. Yesterday a
blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash.</p>
<p>To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it
upwithout complaint.</p>
<p>Like an olive that ripens and falls.</p>
<p>Praising its mother, thanking the tree it grew on.</p>
<ol start="49" type="1">
<li>To be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands
unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it.</li>
</ol>
<p>49a. —It’s unfortunate that this has happened.</p>
<p>No. It’s fortunate that this has happened and I’ve remained unharmed
by it—not shattered by the present or frightened of the future. It could
have happened to anyone. But not everyone could have remained unharmed
by it. Why treat the one as a misfortune rather than the other as
fortunate? Can you really call something a misfortune that doesn’t
violate human nature? Or do you think something that’s not against
nature’s will can violate it? But you know what its will is. Does what’s
happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control,
sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness, and all the
other qualities that allow a person’s nature to fulfill itself?</p>
<p>So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you
pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and
prevail is great good fortune.</p>
<ol start="50" type="1">
<li>A trite but effective tactic against the fear of death: think of the
list of people who had to be pried away from life. What did they gain by
dying old? In the end, they all sleep six feet under—Caedicianus,
