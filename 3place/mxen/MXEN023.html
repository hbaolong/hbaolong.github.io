<h4 id="book-12">Book 12</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Everything you’re trying to reach—by taking the long way round—you
could have right now, this moment. If you’d only stop thwarting your own
attempts. If you’d only let go of the past, entrust the future to
Providence, and guide the present toward reverence and justice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reverence: so you’ll accept what you’re allotted. Nature intended it
for you, and you for it.</p>
<p>Justice: so that you’ll speak the truth, frankly and without
evasions, and act as you should—and as other people deserve.</p>
<p>Don’t let anything deter you: other people’s misbehavior, your own
misperceptions, What People Will Say, or the feelings of the body that
covers you (let the affected part take care of those). And if, when it’s
time to depart, you shunt everything aside except your mind and the
divinity within . . . if it isn’t ceasing to live that you’re afraid of
but never beginning to live properly . . . then you’ll be worthy of the
world that made you.</p>
<p>No longer an alien in your own land.</p>
<p>No longer shocked by everyday events—as if they were unheard-of
aberrations.</p>
<p>No longer at the mercy of this, or that.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>God sees all our souls freed from their fleshly containers,
stripped clean of their bark, cleansed of their grime. He grasps with
his intelligence alone what was poured and channeled from himself into
them. If you learn to do the same, you can avoid a great deal of
distress. When you see through the flesh that covers you, will you be
unsettled by clothing, mansions, celebrity—the painted sets, the costume
cupboard?</p></li>
<li><p>Your three components: body, breath, mind. Two are yours in
trust; to the third alone you have clear title.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you can cut yourself—your mind—free of what other people do and
say, of what you’ve said or done, of the things that you’re afraid will
happen, the impositions of the body that contains you and the breath
within, and what the whirling chaos sweeps in from outside, so that the
mind is freed from fate, brought to clarity, and lives life on its own
recognizance—doing what’s right, accepting what happens, and speaking
the truth—</p>
<p>If you can cut free of impressions that cling to the mind, free of
the future and the past—can make yourself, as Empedocles says, “a sphere
rejoicing in its perfect stillness,” and concentrate on living what can
be lived (which means the present) . . . then you can spend the time you
have left in tranquillity. And in kindness. And at peace with the spirit
within you.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than
other people, but care more about their opinion than our own. If a god
appeared to us—or a wise human being, even—and prohibited us from
concealing our thoughts or imagining anything without immediately
shouting it out, we wouldn’t make it through a single day. That’s how
much we value other people’s opinions—instead of our own.</p></li>
<li><p>How is it that the gods arranged everything with such skill, such
care for our well-being, and somehow overlooked one thing: that certain
people—in fact, the best of them, the gods’ own partners, the ones whose
piety and good works brought them closest to the divine—that these
people, when they die, should cease to exist forever? Utterly
vanished.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Well, assuming that’s really true, you can be sure they would have
arranged things differently, if that had been appropriate. If it were
the right thing to do, they could have done it, and if it were natural,
nature would have demanded it. So from the fact that they didn’t—if
that’s the case—we can conclude that it was inappropriate.</p>
<p>Surely you can see yourself that to ask the question is to challenge
the gods’ fairness. And why would you be bringing in fairness unless the
gods are, in fact, fair—and absolutely so?</p>
<p>And if they are, how could they have carelessly overlooked something
so unfair—so illogical—in setting up the world?</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Practice even what seems impossible.</li>
</ol>
<p>The left hand is useless at almost everything, for lack of practice.
But it guides the reins better than the right. From practice.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>The condition of soul and body when death comes for us.</li>
</ol>
<p>Shortness of life.</p>
<p>Vastness of time before and after.</p>
<p>Fragility of matter.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>To see the causes of things stripped bare. The aim of actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pain. Pleasure. Death. Fame.</p>
<p>Who is responsible for our own restlessness.</p>
<p>That no one obstructs us.</p>
<p>That it’s all in how you perceive it.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>The student as boxer, not fencer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fencer’s weapon is picked up and put down again.</p>
<p>The boxer’s is part of him. All he has to do is clench his fist.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p>To see things as they are. Substance, cause and purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>The freedom to do only what God wants, and accept whatever God
sends us.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>11a. What it’s made of.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p>The gods are not to blame. They do nothing wrong, on purpose or
by accident. Nor men either; they don’t do it on purpose. No one is to
blame.</p></li>
<li><p>The foolishness of people who are surprised by anything that
happens. Like travelers amazed at foreign customs.</p></li>
<li><p>Fatal necessity, and inescapable order. Or benevolent Providence.
Or confusion—random and undirected.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If it’s an inescapable necessity, why resist it?</p>
<p>If it’s Providence, and admits of being worshipped, then try to be
worthy of God’s aid.</p>
<p>If it’s confusion and anarchy, then be grateful that on this raging
sea you have a mind to guide you. And if the storm should carry you
away, let it carry off flesh, breath and all the rest, but not the mind.
Which can’t be swept away.</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li><p>The lamp shines until it is put out, without losing its gleam,
and yet in you it all gutters out so early—truth, justice,
self-control?</p></li>
<li><p>When someone seems to have injured you:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But how can I be sure?</p>
<p>And in any case, keep in mind:</p>
<p>• that he’s already been tried and convicted—by himself. (Like
scratching your own eyes out.)</p>
<p>• that to expect a bad person not to harm others is like expecting
fig trees not to secrete juice, babies not to cry, horses not to
neigh—the inevitable not to happen.</p>
<p>What else could they do—with that sort of character?</p>
<p>If you’re still angry, then get to work on that.</p>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li><p>If it’s not right, don’t do it. If it’s not true, don’t say it.
Let your intention be &lt; . . . &gt;</p></li>
<li><p>At all times, look at the thing itself—the thing behind the
appearance—and unpack it by analysis:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>• cause</p>
<p>• substance</p>
<p>• purpose</p>
<p>• and the length of time it exists.</p>
<ol start="19" type="1">
<li>It’s time you realized that you have something in you more powerful
and miraculous than the things that affect you and make you dance like a
puppet.</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s in my thoughts at this moment? Fear? Jealousy? Desire?
Feelings like that?</p>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li>To undertake nothing:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>at random or without a purpose;</p></li>
<li><p>for any reason but the common good.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="21" type="1">
<li>That before long you’ll be no one, and nowhere. Like all the things
you see now. All the people now living.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything’s destiny is to change, to be transformed, to perish. So
that new things can be born.</p>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li><p>It’s all in how you perceive it. You’re in control. You can
dispense with misperception at will, like rounding the point. Serenity,
total calm, safe anchorage.</p></li>
<li><p>A given action that stops when it’s supposed to is none the worse
for stopping. Nor the person engaged in it either. So too with the
succession of actions we call “life.” If it ends when it’s supposed to,
it’s none the worse for that. And the person who comes to the end of the
line has no cause for complaint. The time and stopping point are set by
nature—our own nature, in some cases (death from old age); or nature as
a whole, whose parts, shifting and changing, constantly renew the world,
and keep it on schedule.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing that benefits all things can be ugly or out of place. The end
of life is not an evil—it doesn’t disgrace us. (Why should we be ashamed
of an involuntary act that injures no one?). It’s a good thing—scheduled
by the world, promoting it, promoted by it.</p>
<p>This is how we become godlike—following God’s path, and reason’s
goals.</p>
<ol start="24" type="1">
<li>Three things, essential at all times:</li>
</ol>
<p>i(a). your own actions: that they’re not arbitrary or different from
what abstract justice would do.</p>
<p>i(b). external events: that they happen randomly or by design. You
can’t complain about chance. You can’t argue with Providence.</p>
<ol start="2" type="i">
<li><p>what all things are like, from the planting of the seed to the
quickening of life, and from its quickening to its relinquishment. Where
the parts came from and where they return to.</p></li>
<li><p>that if you were suddenly lifted up and could see life and its
variety from a vast height, and at the same time all the things around
you, in the sky and beyond it, you’d see how pointless it is. And no
matter how often you saw it, it would be the same: the same life forms,
the same life span.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Arrogance . . . about this?</p>
<ol start="25" type="1">
<li><p>Throw out your misperceptions and you’ll be fine. (And who’s
stopping you from throwing them out?)</p></li>
<li><p>To be angry at something means you’ve forgotten:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That everything that happens is natural.</p>
<p>That the responsibility is theirs, not yours.</p>
<p>And further . . .</p>
<p>That whatever happens has always happened, and always will, and is
happening at this very moment, everywhere. Just like this.</p>
<p>What links one human being to all humans: not blood, or birth, but
mind.</p>
<p>And . . .</p>
<p>That an individual’s mind is God and of God.</p>
<p>That nothing belongs to anyone. Children, body, life itself—all of
them come from that same source.</p>
<p>That it’s all how you choose to see things.</p>
<p>That the present is all we have to live in. Or to lose.</p>
<ol start="27" type="1">
<li>Constantly run down the list of those who felt intense anger at
something: the most famous, the most unfortunate, the most hated, the
most whatever. And ask: Where is all that now? Smoke, dust, legend . . .
or not even a legend. Think of all the examples: Fabius Catullinus in
the country, Lusius Lupus in the orchard, Stertinius at Baiae, Tiberius
on Capri, Velius Rufus . . . obsession and arrogance.</li>
</ol>
<p>And how trivial the things we want so passionately are. And how much
more philosophical it would be to take what we’re given and show
uprightness, self-control, obedience to God, without making a production
of it. There’s nothing more insufferable than people who boast about
their own humility.</p>
<ol start="28" type="1">
<li>People ask, “Have you ever seen the gods you worship? How can you be
sure they exist?”</li>
</ol>
<p>Answers:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Just look around you.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve never seen my soul either. And yet I revere it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s how I know the gods exist and why I revere them—from having
felt their power, over and over.</p>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li>Salvation: to see each thing for what it is—its nature and its
purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>To do only what is right, say only what is true, without holding
back.</p>
<p>What else could it be but to live life fully—to pay out goodness like
the rings of a chain, without the slightest gap.</p>
<ol start="30" type="1">
<li>Singular, not plural:</li>
</ol>
<p>Sunlight. Though broken up by walls and mountains and a thousand
other things.</p>
<p>Substance. Though split into a thousand forms, variously shaped.</p>
<p>Life. Though distributed among a thousand different natures with
their individual limitations.</p>
<p>Intelligence. Even if it seems to be divided.</p>
<p>The other components—breath, matter—lack any awareness or connection
to one another (yet unity and its gravitational pull embrace them
too).</p>
<p>But intelligence is uniquely drawn toward what is akin to it, and
joins with it inseparably, in shared awareness.</p>
<ol start="31" type="1">
<li>What is it you want? To keep on breathing? What about feeling?
desiring? growing? ceasing to grow? using your voice? thinking? Which of
them seems worth having?</li>
</ol>
<p>But if you can do without them all, then continue to follow the
logos, and God. To the end. To prize those other things—to grieve
because death deprives us of them—is an obstacle.</p>
<ol start="32" type="1">
<li>The fraction of infinity, of that vast abyss of time, allotted to
each of us. Absorbed in an instant into eternity.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fraction of all substance, and all spirit.</p>
<p>The fraction of the whole earth you crawl about on.</p>
<p>Keep all that in mind, and don’t treat anything as important except
doing what your nature demands, and accepting what Nature sends you.</p>
<ol start="33" type="1">
<li><p>How the mind conducts itself. It all depends on that. All the
rest is within its power, or beyond its control—corpses and
smoke.</p></li>
<li><p>An incentive to treat death as unimportant: even people whose
only morality is pain and pleasure can manage that much.</p></li>
<li><p>If you make ripeness alone your good . . .</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If a few actions more or less, governed by the right logos, are
merely a few more or less . . .</p>
<p>If it makes no difference whether you look at the world for this long
or that long . . .</p>
<p>. . . then death shouldn’t scare you.</p>
<ol start="36" type="1">
<li>You’ve lived as a citizen in a great city. Five years or a
hundred—what’s the difference? The laws make no distinction.</li>
</ol>
<p>And to be sent away from it, not by a tyrant or a dishonest judge,
but by Nature, who first invited you in—why is that so terrible?</p>
<p>Like the impresario ringing down the curtain on an actor:</p>
<p>“But I’ve only gotten through three acts . . . !”</p>
<p>Yes. This will be a drama in three acts, the length fixed by the
power that directed your creation, and now directs your dissolution.
Neither was yours to determine.</p>
<p>So make your exit with grace—the same grace shown to you.</p>
