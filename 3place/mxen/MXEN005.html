<h4 id="stoicism-and-the-meditations">Stoicism and the Meditations</h4>
<p>The late Stoicism of Epictetus is a radically stripped-down version
of its Hellenistic predecessor, a philosophy which “had learnt much from
its competitors and had almost forgotten parts of itself.”3 Both these
tendencies, the narrowing of the field and the eclectic borrowing from
non-Stoic sources, can be discerned also in the Meditations.</p>
<p>Chrysippus and his followers had divided knowledge into three areas:
logic, physics and ethics, concerned, respectively, with the nature of
knowledge, the structure of the physical world and the proper role of
human beings in that world. Marcus pays lip service to this triadic
division in at least one entry (8.13), but it is clear from other
chapters and from the Meditations as a whole that logic and physics were
not his focus. Among the things for which he thanks the gods is that he
was never “absorbed by logic-chopping, or preoccupied by physics”
(1.17). Occasional entries show an awareness of Stoic thought about
language (the etymological pun in 8.57 is perhaps the clearest example),
but they are the exception, not the rule. In many cases Marcus’s logic
is weak—the logic of the rhetorician, not of the philosopher; it is rare
to find a developed chain of reasoning like that in Meditations 4.4. His
interest in the nature of the physical world is limited to its relevance
to human problems. About one of the basic Stoic physical doctrines—the
notion of the periodic conflagration (ekpyrosis) that ends a cosmic
cycle—Marcus adopts an agnostic position (though he was not alone in
this). To him it was ethics that was the basis of the system: “just
because you’ve abandoned your hopes of becoming a great thinker or
scientist, don’t give up on attaining freedom, achieving humility,
serving others . . .” (7.67).</p>
<p>The questions that the Meditations tries to answer are primarily
metaphysical and ethical ones: Why are we here? How should we live our
lives? How can we ensure that we do what is right? How can we protect
ourselves against the stresses and pressures of daily life? How should
we deal with pain and misfortune? How can we live with the knowledge
that someday we will no longer exist? It would be both pointless and
impertinent to try to summarize Marcus’s responses; the influence of the
Meditations on later readers springs in part from the clarity and
insistence with which he addresses these questions. It may be
worthwhile, however, to draw attention to one pattern of thought that is
central to the philosophy of the Meditations (as well as to Epictetus),
and that has been identified and documented in detail by Pierre Hadot.
This is the doctrine of the three “disciplines”: the disciplines of
perception, of action and of the will.</p>
<p>The discipline of perception requires that we maintain absolute
objectivity of thought: that we see things dispassionately for what they
are. Proper understanding of this point requires a brief introduction to
the Stoic theory of cognition. We have seen that for the Stoics
universal order is represented by the logos. The logos infuses and is
wielded by our hegemonikon (literally, “that which guides”), which is
the intellective part of our consciousness. In different contexts it can
approximate either “will” or “character” and it performs many of the
functions that English speakers attribute to the brain or the heart.4
One of its primary functions is to process and assess the data we
receive from our senses. At every instant the objects and events in the
world around us bombard us with impressions. As they do so they produce
a phantasia, a mental impression. From this the mind generates a
perception (hypolepsis), which might best be compared to a print made
from a photographic negative. Ideally this print will be an accurate and
faithful representation of the original. But it may not be. It may be
blurred, or it may include shadow images that distort or obscure the
original.</p>
<p>Chief among these are inappropriate value judgments: the designation
as “good” or “evil” of things that in fact are neither good nor evil.
For example, my impression that my house has just burned down is simply
that—an impression or report conveyed to me by my senses about an event
in the outside world. By contrast, my perception that my house has
burned down and I have thereby suffered a terrible tragedy includes not
only an impression, but also an interpretation imposed upon that initial
impression by my powers of hypolepsis. It is by no means the only
possible interpretation, and I am not obliged to accept it. I may be a
good deal better off if I decline to do so. It is, in other words, not
objects and events but the interpretations we place on them that are the
problem. Our duty is therefore to exercise stringent control over the
faculty of perception, with the aim of protecting our mind from
error.</p>
<p>The second discipline, that of action, relates to our relationship
with other people. Human beings, for Marcus as for the Stoics generally,
are social animals, a point he makes often (e.g., 5.16, 8.59, 9.1). All
human beings possess not only a share of the logos but also the ability
to use it (that is what makes us human and distinguishes us from other
animals). But it would perhaps be more accurate to say that we are
participants in the logos, which is as much a process as a substance.
Marcus himself more than once compares the world ruled by logos to a
city in which all human beings are citizens, with all the duties
inherent in citizenship. As human beings we are part of nature, and our
duty is to accommodate ourselves to its demands and requirements—“to
live as nature requires,” as Marcus often puts it. To do this we must
make proper use of the logos we have been allotted, and perform as best
we can the functions assigned us in the master plan of the larger,
cosmic logos, of which it is a part. This requires not merely passive
acquiescence in what happens, but active cooperation with the world,
with fate and, above all, with other human beings. We were made, Marcus
tells us over and over, not for ourselves but for others, and our nature
is fundamentally unselfish. In our relationships with others we must
work for their collective good, while treating them justly and fairly as
individuals.</p>
<p>Marcus never defines what he means by justice, and it is important to
recognize what the term implies and what it does not. All human beings
have a share of the logos, and all have roles to play in the vast design
that is the world. But this is not to say that all humans are equal or
that the roles they are assigned are interchangeable. Marcus, like most
of his contemporaries, took it for granted that human society was
hierarchical, and this is borne out by the images he uses to describe
it. Human society is a single organism, like an individual human body or
a tree. But the trunk of the tree is not to be confused with the leaves,
or the hands and feet with the head. Our duty to act justly does not
mean that we must treat others as our equals; it means that we must
treat them as they deserve. And their deserts are determined in part by
their position in the hierarchy. Stoicism’s emphasis on the orderliness
of the universe implies a similar orderliness and harmony in its parts,
and part of its appeal to upper-class Romans may have been that it did
not force its adherents to ask difficult questions about the
organization of the society they lived in.5</p>
<p>The third discipline, the discipline of will, is in a sense the
counterpart to the second, the discipline of action. The latter governs
our approach to the things in our control, those that we do; the
discipline of will governs our attitude to things that are not within
our control, those that we have done to us (by others or by nature). We
control our own actions and are responsible for them. If we act wrongly,
then we have done serious harm to ourselves (though not, it should be
emphasized, to others, or to the logos). By contrast, things outside our
control have no ability to harm us. Acts of wrongdoing by a human agent
(torture, theft, or other crimes) harm the agent, not the victim. Acts
of nature such as fire, illness, or death can harm us only if we choose
to see them as harmful. When we do so, we question the benevolence and
providence of the logos, and thereby degrade our own logos.</p>
<p>This, of course, we must not do. Instead we must see things for what
they are (here the discipline of perception is relevant) and accept
them, by exercising the discipline of will, or what Epictetus calls (in
a phrase quoted by Marcus) “the art of acquiescence.” For if we
recognize that all events have been foreseen by the logos and form part
of its plan, and that the plan in question is unfailingly good (as it
must be), then it follows that we must accept whatever fate has in store
for us, however unpleasant it may appear, trusting that, in Alexander
Pope’s phrase, “whatever is, is right.” This applies to all obstacles
and (apparent) misfortunes, and in particular to death—a process that we
cannot prevent, which therefore does not harm us, and which accordingly
we must accept willingly as natural and proper.</p>
<p>Together, the three disciplines constitute a comprehensive approach
to life, and in various combinations and reformulations they underlie a
large number of the entries in the Meditations. We see them laid out
starkly and explicitly in Meditations 7.54:</p>
<p>Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option:</p>
<p>• to accept this event with humility [will];</p>
<p>• to treat this person as he should be treated [action];</p>
<p>• to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational
creeps in [perception].</p>
<p>We find the same triad rephrased and reordered in Meditations 9.6:
“Objective judgment . . . Unselfish action . . . Willing acceptance . .
. of all external events.”</p>
<p>And we find it in a more subtle form underlying Meditations 8.7:</p>
<p>. . . progress for a rational mind means not accepting falsehood or
uncertainty in its perceptions, making unselfish actions its only aim,
seeking and shunning only the things it has control over, embracing what
nature demands of it—the nature in which it participates, as the leaf’s
nature does in the tree’s.</p>
<p>A score of other entries could be cited. The almost obsessive
repetition of these three points suggests that they lie at the very
heart of Marcus’s thought, and of his project in the Meditations.</p>
