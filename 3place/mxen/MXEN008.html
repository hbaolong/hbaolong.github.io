<h4 id="recurring-themes">Recurring Themes</h4>
<p>To try to extract a sustained and coherent argument from the
Meditations as a whole would be an unprofitable exercise. It is simply
not that kind of work. It would be equally fruitless to try to read
autobiographical elements into individual entries (to take 9.42 as
referring to the revolt of Avidius Cassius, for example, or 10.4 as a
reflection on Commodus)—all the more so since so few of the entries can
be dated with any security. This is not to say that the Meditations has
no unity or no relationship to Marcus’s own life, for it has both. What
unifies it is the recurrence of a small number of themes that surely
reflect Marcus’s own preoccupations. It is the points to which Marcus
returns most often that offer the best insight into his character and
concerns.</p>
<p>One example that will strike almost any reader is the sense of
mortality that pervades the work. Death is not to be feared, Marcus
continually reminds himself. It is a natural process, part of the
continual change that forms the world. At other points it is the
ultimate consolation. “Soon you will be dead,” Marcus tells himself on a
number of occasions, “and none of it will matter” (cf. 4.6, 7.22, 8.2).
The emphasis on the vanity and worthlessness of earthly concerns is here
linked to the more general idea of transience. All things change or pass
away, perish and are forgotten. This is the burden of several of the
thought exercises that Marcus sets himself: to think of the court of
Augustus (8.31), of the age of Vespasian or Trajan (4.32), the great
philosophers and thinkers of the past (6.47)—all now dust and ashes.</p>
<p>This theme is not specific to Stoicism. We meet it at every turn in
ancient literature. Marcus himself quotes the famous passage in Book 6
of Homer’s Iliad in which the lives of mortals are compared to leaves
that grow in the spring, flourish for a season and then fall and die, to
be replaced by others (10.34). He would have recognized the sentiment in
other writers too, from the melancholy Greek lyric poet Mimnermus, who
develops and expands on Homer’s simile, to the Roman lawyer Servius
Sulpicius, writing to his friend Cicero on the death of the latter’s
daughter:</p>
<p>I want to share with you something that brought me not a little
consolation, in hopes that it might have the same effect on you. On my
way back from Asia, on the voyage from Aegina to Megara, I gazed at the
lands we passed. Aegina was behind me, Megara before me, Piraeus on the
starboard side, Corinth to port—towns which flourished once upon a time,
and now lie fallen and in ruins before our eyes—and I said to myself,
“Alas! . . . and will you, Servius, not restrain your grief and recall
that you were born a mortal?” Believe me, the thought was no small
consolation to me.</p>
<p>This is not a point modern grief counselors would be inclined to
dwell on, but it is one that Marcus would have understood perfectly, and
its appeal to him casts light on both his character and his background.
Marcus may have been a Stoic, but he was also a Roman, influenced not
only by Zeno and Chrysippus but by Homer and Vergil. Vergil is nowhere
mentioned in the Meditations, and in a Greek work could hardly be quoted
or alluded to, but there is a note of melancholy that runs through the
work that one can only call Vergilian.</p>
<p>Other concerns surface as well. A number of entries discuss methods
of dealing with pain or bodily weakness of other sorts. “When you have
trouble getting out of bed . . .” begin several entries (5.1, 8.12). A
persistent motif is the need to restrain anger and irritation with other
people, to put up with their incompetence or malice, to show them the
errors of their ways. Several entries focus on the frustrations of life
at court, nowhere more present than when Marcus tells himself to stop
complaining about them (8.9). He contrasts the court against philosophy
as a stepmother against a mother—to be visited out of duty, but not
someone we can really love (6.12). Yet the court need not be an
obstacle: it can be a challenge, even an opportunity. One can lead a
good life anywhere, even at court, as Antoninus showed (5.16, 1.16). “No
role [is] so well suited to philosophy,” Marcus tells himself, “as the
one you happen to be in right now” (11.7).</p>
<p>A more subtle clue to Marcus’s personality is the imagery that he
prefers. It is worth noting, for example, how many images of nature
occur in the Meditations. Many readers have been struck by Meditations
3.2, with its evocation of “nature’s inadvertence” in baking bread or
ripening figs, olives, and stalks of wheat. Metaphors and offhand
comparisons in other entries evoke the pastoral and agricultural rhythms
of the Mediterranean world, with its flocks, herds, and vines, its
seasons of sowing and harvesting, its grapes drying slowly into raisins.
Some of these may be stock examples, but even a stock example can be
revealing. One can hardly read a page of Plato without tripping over the
helmsmen, doctors, shoemakers, and other craftsmen who populated ancient
Athens; such figures are much rarer in Marcus. The image of society as a
tree whose branches are individual human beings expresses an important
Stoic principle, but the image is developed further than one might
expect and informed by what might be personal observation: “You can see
the difference between the branch that’s been there since the beginning,
remaining on the tree and growing with it, and the one that’s been cut
off and grafted back.”</p>
<p>Affection for the natural world contrasts with a persistent sense of
disgust and contempt for human life and other human beings—a sense that
it is difficult to derive from (or even reconcile with) Stoicism. As P.
A. Brunt puts it, “Reason told Marcus that the world was good beyond
improvement, and yet it constantly appeared to him evil beyond remedy.”
The courtiers who surround him are vain and obsequious, while the people
he deals with on a daily basis are “meddling, ungrateful, arrogant,
dishonest, jealous, and surly” (2.1). One of the most frequently
recurring points in the Meditations is the reminder that human beings
are social animals, as if this was a point Marcus had a particularly
hard time accepting. The gods care for mortals, he reminds himself, “and
you—on the verge of death—you still refuse to care for them.”</p>
<p>There is a persistent strain of pessimism in the work. “The things we
want in life are empty, stale, and trivial. Dogs snarling at each other.
Quarreling children—laughing and then bursting into tears a moment
later. Trust, shame, justice, truth—‘gone from the earth and only found
in heaven.’ Why are you still here?” (5.33). Images of dirt appear in
several entries. The world around us resembles the baths: “oil, sweat,
dirt, grayish water, all of it disgusting” (8.24). If Marcus
contemplates the stars, he does so only in order to “wash off the mud of
life below” (7.47). And the objective analysis Marcus prizes often
shades over into a depressing cynicism (in the modern sense of the
term). “Disgust at what things are made of: Liquid, dust, bones, filth.
Or marble as hardened dirt, gold and silver as residues, clothes as
hair, purple dye as shellfish blood. And all the rest” (9.36). The human
body itself is no more than “rotting meat in a bag” (8.38). “[D]espise
your flesh. A mess of blood, pieces of bone, a woven tangle of nerves,
veins, arteries” (2.2). Perhaps the most depressing entry in the entire
work is the one in which Marcus urges himself to cultivate an
indifference to music (11.2).</p>
<p>As one scholar has observed, “reading the Meditations for long
periods can be conducive of melancholy.” And even those who love the
book cannot deny that there is something impoverishing about the view of
human life it presents. Matthew Arnold, whose essay on the work reveals
a deep respect and affection for Marcus, identified the central
shortcoming of his philosophy as its failure to make any allowance for
joy, and I think this is a fair criticism. Marcus does not offer us a
means of achieving happiness, but only a means of resisting pain. The
Stoicism of the Meditations is fundamentally a defensive philosophy; it
is noteworthy how many military images recur, from references to the
soul as being “posted” or “stationed” to the famous image of the mind as
an invulnerable fortress (8.48). Such images are not unique to Marcus,
but one can imagine that they might have had special meaning for an
emperor whose last years were spent in “warfare and a journey far from
home” (2.17). For Marcus, life was a battle, and often it must have
seemed—what in some sense it must always be—a losing battle.</p>
<p>There are also a handful of points in the text where we have glimpses
of a different frame of mind, most obviously when Marcus refers to the
gods. From a Stoic perspective, of course, “God” or “the gods” (the
terms are used interchangeably by many ancient writers) are merely
conventional terms for what we might equally well call “nature” or “the
logos” or “Providence,” or simply “how things are.” Marcus stresses the
benevolence of this power (what is divine must be good, surely?), but it
is clear that he also ascribes to its actions the implacability with
which orthodox Stoic doctrine endows it. It is not easy to see why one
should pray to a power whose decisions one can hardly hope to influence,
and indeed Marcus several times seems to admit the possibility that one
should not (5.7, 6.44, 9.40).</p>
<p>It is all the more surprising, then, to find Marcus elsewhere
suggesting a more personal concern on the gods’ part. The final entry of
Book 1 is the most obvious example. Here Marcus indicates that the gods
have aided him quite directly “through their gifts, their help, their
inspiration,” just as they have others (cf. 9.11). Their help is
curiously concrete. Among the things for which they are thanked are
“remedies granted through dreams,” including “the one at Caieta” (1.17;
the text is uncertain). The gods also assist other people, he reminds
himself, “just as they do you—by signs and dreams and every other way”
(9.27). That Marcus himself did believe deeply in the gods, not merely
as a figure of speech but as a real force in his own life, is suggested
by his refutation of those who doubt their existence: “I know the gods
exist. . . .—from having felt their power, over and over” (12.28). How
was this personal relationship with the divine to be reconciled with the
impersonal logos of the Stoics? The question seems to be played out in
the dialogue at Meditations 9.40. “But those are things the gods left up
to me,” protests one voice, to which another responds, “And what makes
you think the gods don’t care about what’s up to us?” Marcus himself may
not have fully recognized or acknowledged this conflict, but its
existence may point to a half-conscious awareness that the answer
Stoicism offered was not in every respect satisfactory.</p>
