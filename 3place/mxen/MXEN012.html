<p>ON THE RIVER GRAN, AMONG THE QUADI</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal
with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous,
and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil.
But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have
recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the
same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the
divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in
ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born
to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth,
upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at
someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.</p></li>
<li><p>Whatever this is that I am, it is flesh and a little spirit and
an intelligence. Throw away your books; stop letting yourself be
distracted. That is not allowed. Instead, as if you were dying right
now, despise your flesh. A mess of blood, pieces of bone, a woven tangle
of nerves, veins, arteries. Consider what the spirit is: air, and never
the same air, but vomited out and gulped in again every instant.
Finally, the intelligence. Think of it this way: You are an old man.
Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish
impulses, to kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the
future.</p></li>
<li><p>What is divine is full of Providence. Even chance is not divorced
from nature, from the inweaving and enfolding of things governed by
Providence. Everything proceeds from it. And then there is necessity and
the needs of the whole world, of which you are a part. Whatever the
nature of the whole does, and whatever serves to maintain it, is good
for every part of nature. The world is maintained by change—in the
elements and in the things they compose. That should be enough for you;
treat it as an axiom. Discard your thirst for books, so that you won’t
die in bitterness, but in cheerfulness and truth, grateful to the gods
from the bottom of your heart.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember how long you’ve been putting this off, how many
extensions the gods gave you, and you didn’t use them. At some point you
have to recognize what world it is that you belong to; what power rules
it and from what source you spring; that there is a limit to the time
assigned you, and if you don’t use it to free yourself it will be gone
and will never return.</p></li>
<li><p>Concentrate every minute like a Roman—like a man—on doing what’s
in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly,
willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other
distractions. Yes, you can—if you do everything as if it were the last
thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting
your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being
hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have
to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this,
that’s all even the gods can ask of you.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, keep on degrading yourself, soul. But soon your chance at
dignity will be gone. Everyone gets one life. Yours is almost used up,
and instead of treating yourself with respect, you have entrusted your
own happiness to the souls of others.</p></li>
<li><p>Do external things distract you? Then make time for yourself to
learn something worthwhile; stop letting yourself be pulled in all
directions. But make sure you guard against the other kind of confusion.
People who labor all their lives but have no purpose to direct every
thought and impulse toward are wasting their time—even when hard at
work.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignoring what goes on in other people’s souls—no one ever came to
grief that way. But if you won’t keep track of what your own soul’s
doing, how can you not be unhappy?</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t ever forget these things:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The nature of the world.</p>
<p>My nature.</p>
<p>How I relate to the world.</p>
<p>What proportion of it I make up.</p>
<p>That you are part of nature, and no one can prevent you from speaking
and acting in harmony with it, always.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p>In comparing sins (the way people do) Theophrastus says that the
ones committed out of desire are worse than the ones committed out of
anger: which is good philosophy. The angry man seems to turn his back on
reason out of a kind of pain and inner convulsion. But the man motivated
by desire, who is mastered by pleasure, seems somehow more
self-indulgent, less manly in his sins. Theophrastus is right, and
philosophically sound, to say that the sin committed out of pleasure
deserves a harsher rebuke than the one committed out of pain. The angry
man is more like a victim of wrongdoing, provoked by pain to anger. The
other man rushes into wrongdoing on his own, moved to action by
desire.</p></li>
<li><p>You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do
and say and think. If the gods exist, then to abandon human beings is
not frightening; the gods would never subject you to harm. And if they
don’t exist, or don’t care what happens to us, what would be the point
of living in a world without gods or Providence? But they do exist, they
do care what happens to us, and everything a person needs to avoid real
harm they have placed within him. If there were anything harmful on the
other side of death, they would have made sure that the ability to avoid
it was within you. If it doesn’t harm your character, how can it harm
your life? Nature would not have overlooked such dangers through failing
to recognize them, or because it saw them but was powerless to prevent
or correct them. Nor would it ever, through inability or incompetence,
make such a mistake as to let good and bad things happen
indiscriminately to good and bad alike. But death and life, success and
failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen to good
and bad alike, and they are neither noble nor shameful—and hence neither
good nor bad.</p></li>
<li><p>The speed with which all of them vanish—the objects in the world,
and the memory of them in time. And the real nature of the things our
senses experience, especially those that entice us with pleasure or
frighten us with pain or are loudly trumpeted by pride. To understand
those things—how stupid, contemptible, grimy, decaying, and dead they
are—that’s what our intellectual powers are for. And to understand what
those people really amount to, whose opinions and voices constitute
fame. And what dying is—and that if you look at it in the abstract and
break down your imaginary ideas of it by logical analysis, you realize
that it’s nothing but a process of nature, which only children can be
afraid of. (And not only a process of nature but a necessary one.) And
how man grasps God, with what part of himself he does so, and how that
part is conditioned when he does.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing is more pathetic than people who run around in circles,
“delving into the things that lie beneath” and conducting investigations
into the souls of the people around them, never realizing that all you
have to do is to be attentive to the power inside you and worship it
sincerely. To worship it is to keep it from being muddied with turmoil
and becoming aimless and dissatisfied with nature—divine and human. What
is divine deserves our respect because it is good; what is human
deserves our affection because it is like us. And our pity too,
sometimes, for its inability to tell good from bad—as terrible a
blindness as the kind that can’t tell white from black.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if you’re going to live three thousand more years, or ten
times that, remember: you cannot lose another life than the one you’re
living now, or live another one than the one you’re losing. The longest
amounts to the same as the shortest. The present is the same for
everyone; its loss is the same for everyone; and it should be clear that
a brief instant is all that is lost. For you can’t lose either the past
or the future; how could you lose what you don’t have?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember two things:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>that everything has always been the same, and keeps recurring,
and it makes no difference whether you see the same things recur in a
hundred years or two hundred, or in an infinite period;</p></li>
<li><p>that the longest-lived and those who will die soonest lose the
same thing. The present is all that they can give up, since that is all
you have, and what you do not have, you cannot lose.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li><p>“Everything is just an impression.” —Monimus the Cynic. And the
response is obvious enough. But the point is a useful one, if you take
it for what it’s worth.</p></li>
<li><p>The human soul degrades itself:</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Above all, when it does its best to become an abscess, a kind of
detached growth on the world. To be disgruntled at anything that happens
is a kind of secession from Nature, which comprises the nature of all
things.</p></li>
<li><p>When it turns its back on another person or sets out to do it
harm, as the souls of the angry do.</p></li>
<li><p>When it is overpowered by pleasure or pain.</p></li>
<li><p>When it puts on a mask and does or says something artificial or
false.</p></li>
<li><p>When it allows its action and impulse to be without a purpose, to
be random and disconnected: even the smallest things ought to be
directed toward a goal. But the goal of rational beings is to follow the
rule and law of the most ancient of communities and states.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li>Human life.</li>
</ol>
<p>Duration: momentary. Nature: changeable. Perception: dim. Condition
of Body: decaying. Soul: spinning around. Fortune: unpredictable.
Lasting Fame: uncertain. Sum Up: The body and its parts are a river, the
soul a dream and mist, life is warfare and a journey far from home,
lasting reputation is oblivion.</p>
<p>Then what can guide us?</p>
<p>Only philosophy.</p>
<p>Which means making sure that the power within stays safe and free
from assault, superior to pleasure and pain, doing nothing randomly or
dishonestly and with imposture, not dependent on anyone else’s doing
something or not doing it. And making sure that it accepts what happens
and what it is dealt as coming from the same place it came from. And
above all, that it accepts death in a cheerful spirit, as nothing but
the dissolution of the elements from which each living thing is
composed. If it doesn’t hurt the individual elements to change
continually into one another, why are people afraid of all of them
changing and separating? It’s a natural thing. And nothing natural is
evil.</p>
