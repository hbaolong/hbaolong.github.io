<h4 id="book-1">Book 1</h4>
<p>DEBTS AND LESSONS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>MY GRANDFATHER VERUS</li>
</ol>
<p>Character and self-control.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>MY FATHER (FROM MY OWN MEMORIES AND HIS REPUTATIONf)</li>
</ol>
<p>Integrity and manliness.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>MY MOTHER</li>
</ol>
<p>Her reverence for the divine, her generosity, her inability not only
to do wrong but even to conceive of doing it. And the simple way she
lived—not in the least like the rich.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER</li>
</ol>
<p>To avoid the public schools, to hire good private teachers, and to
accept the resulting costs as money well-spent.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>MY FIRST TEACHER</li>
</ol>
<p>Not to support this side or that in chariot-racing, this fighter or
that in the games. To put up with discomfort and not make demands. To do
my own work, mind my own business, and have no time for slanderers.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>DIOGNETUS</li>
</ol>
<p>Not to waste time on nonsense. Not to be taken in by conjurors and
hoodoo artists with their talk about incantations and exorcism and all
the rest of it. Not to be obsessed with quail-fighting or other crazes
like that. To hear unwelcome truths. To practice philosophy, and to
study with Baccheius, and then with Tandasis and Marcianus. To write
dialogues as a student. To choose the Greek lifestyle—the camp-bed and
the cloak.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>RUSTICUS</li>
</ol>
<p>The recognition that I needed to train and discipline my
character.</p>
<p>Not to be sidetracked by my interest in rhetoric. Not to write
treatises on abstract questions, or deliver moralizing little sermons,
or compose imaginary descriptions of The Simple Life or The Man Who
Lives Only for Others. To steer clear of oratory, poetry and belles
lettres.</p>
<p>Not to dress up just to stroll around the house, or things like that.
To write straightforward letters (like the one he sent my mother from
Sinuessa). And to behave in a conciliatory way when people who have
angered or annoyed us want to make up.</p>
<p>To read attentively—not to be satisfied with “just getting the gist
of it.” And not to fall for every smooth talker.</p>
<p>And for introducing me to Epictetus’s lectures—and loaning me his own
copy.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>APOLLONIUS</li>
</ol>
<p>Independence and unvarying reliability, and to pay attention to
nothing, no matter how fleetingly, except the logos. And to be the same
in all circumstances—intense pain, the loss of a child, chronic illness.
And to see clearly, from his example, that a man can show both strength
and flexibility.</p>
<p>His patience in teaching. And to have seen someone who clearly viewed
his expertise and ability as a teacher as the humblest of virtues.</p>
<p>And to have learned how to accept favors from friends without losing
your self-respect or appearing ungrateful.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>SEXTUS</li>
</ol>
<p>Kindness.</p>
<p>An example of fatherly authority in the home. What it means to live
as nature requires.</p>
<p>Gravity without airs.</p>
<p>To show intuitive sympathy for friends, tolerance to amateurs and
sloppy thinkers. His ability to get along with everyone: sharing his
company was the highest of compliments, and the opportunity an honor for
those around him.</p>
<p>To investigate and analyze, with understanding and logic, the
principles we ought to live by.</p>
<p>Not to display anger or other emotions. To be free of passion and yet
full of love.</p>
<p>To praise without bombast; to display expertise without
pretension.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>THE LITERARY CRITIC ALEXANDER</li>
</ol>
<p>Not to be constantly correcting people, and in particular not to jump
on them whenever they make an error of usage or a grammatical mistake or
mispronounce something, but just answer their question or add another
example, or debate the issue itself (not their phrasing), or make some
other contribution to the discussion—and insert the right expression,
unobtrusively.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>FRONTO</li>
</ol>
<p>To recognize the malice, cunning, and hypocrisy that power produces,
and the peculiar ruthlessness often shown by people from “good
families.”</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>ALEXANDER THE PLATONIST</li>
</ol>
<p>Not to be constantly telling people (or writing them) that I’m too
busy, unless I really am. Similarly, not to be always ducking my
responsibilities to the people around me because of “pressing
business.”</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>CATULUS</li>
</ol>
<p>Not to shrug off a friend’s resentment—even unjustified
resentment—but try to put things right.</p>
<p>To show your teachers ungrudging respect (the Domitius and
Athenodotus story), and your children unfeigned love.</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>[MY BROTHER] SEVERUS</li>
</ol>
<p>To love my family, truth and justice. It was through him that I
encountered Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion and Brutus, and conceived of
a society of equal laws, governed by equality of status and of speech,
and of rulers who respect the liberty of their subjects above all
else.</p>
<p>And from him as well, to be steady and consistent in valuing
philosophy.</p>
<p>And to help others and be eager to share, not to be a pessimist, and
never to doubt your friends’ affection for you. And that when people
incurred his disapproval, they always knew it. And that his friends
never had to speculate about his attitude to anything: it was always
clear.</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>MAXIMUSMaximus</li>
</ol>
<p>Self-control and resistance to distractions.</p>
<p>Optimism in adversity—especially illness.</p>
<p>A personality in balance: dignity and grace together.</p>
<p>Doing your job without whining.</p>
<p>Other people’s certainty that what he said was what he thought, and
what he did was done without malice.</p>
<p>Never taken aback or apprehensive. Neither rash nor hesitant—or
bewildered, or at a loss. Not obsequious—but not aggressive or paranoid
either.</p>
<p>Generosity, charity, honesty.</p>
<p>The sense he gave of staying on the path rather than being kept on
it.</p>
<p>That no one could ever have felt patronized by him—or in a position
to patronize him.</p>
<p>A sense of humor.</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>MY ADOPTED FATHER</li>
</ol>
<p>Compassion. Unwavering adherence to decisions, once he’d reached
them. Indifference to superficial honors. Hard work. Persistence.</p>
<p>Listening to anyone who could contribute to the public good.</p>
<p>His dogged determination to treat people as they deserved.</p>
<p>A sense of when to push and when to back off.</p>
<p>Putting a stop to the pursuit of boys.</p>
<p>His altruism. Not expecting his friends to keep him entertained at
dinner or to travel with him (unless they wanted to). And anyone who had
to stay behind to take care of something always found him the same when
he returned.</p>
<p>His searching questions at meetings. A kind of single-mindedness,
almost, never content with first impressions, or breaking off the
discussion prematurely.</p>
<p>His constancy to friends—never getting fed up with them, or playing
favorites.</p>
<p>Self-reliance, always. And cheerfulness.</p>
<p>And his advance planning (well in advance) and his discreet attention
to even minor things.</p>
<p>His restrictions on acclamations—and all attempts to flatter him.</p>
<p>His constant devotion to the empire’s needs. His stewardship of the
treasury. His willingness to take responsibility—and blame—for both.</p>
<p>His attitude to the gods: no superstitiousness. And his attitude to
men: no demagoguery, no currying favor, no pandering. Always sober,
always steady, and never vulgar or a prey to fads.</p>
<p>The way he handled the material comforts that fortune had supplied
him in such abundance—without arrogance and without apology. If they
were there, he took advantage of them. If not, he didn’t miss them.</p>
<p>No one ever called him glib, or shameless, or pedantic. They saw him
for what he was: a man tested by life, accomplished, unswayed by
flattery, qualified to govern both himself and them.</p>
<p>His respect for people who practiced philosophy—at least, those who
were sincere about it. But without denigrating the others—or listening
to them.</p>
<p>His ability to feel at ease with people—and put them at their ease,
without being pushy.</p>
<p>His willingness to take adequate care of himself. Not a hypochondriac
or obsessed with his appearance, but not ignoring things either. With
the result that he hardly ever needed medical attention, or drugs or any
sort of salve or ointment.</p>
<p>This, in particular: his willingness to yield the floor to experts—in
oratory, law, psychology, whatever—and to support them energetically, so
that each of them could fulfill his potential.</p>
<p>That he respected tradition without needing to constantly
congratulate himself for Safeguarding Our Traditional Values.</p>
<p>Not prone to go off on tangents, or pulled in all directions, but
sticking with the same old places and the same old things.</p>
<p>The way he could have one of his migraines and then go right back to
what he was doing—fresh and at the top of his game.</p>
<p>That he had so few secrets—only state secrets, in fact, and not all
that many of those.</p>
<p>The way he kept public actions within reasonable bounds—games,
building projects, distributions of money and so on—because he looked to
what needed doing and not the credit to be gained from doing it.</p>
<p>No bathing at strange hours, no self-indulgent building projects, no
concern for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or having
attractive slaves. (The robe from his farm at Lorium, most of the things
at Lanuvium, the way he accepted the customs agent’s apology at
Tusculum, etc.)</p>
<p>He never exhibited rudeness, lost control of himself, or turned
violent. No one ever saw him sweat. Everything was to be approached
logically and with due consideration, in a calm and orderly fashion but
decisively, and with no loose ends.</p>
<p>You could have said of him (as they say of Socrates) that he knew how
to enjoy and abstain from things that most people find it hard to
abstain from and all too easy to enjoy. Strength, perseverance,
self-control in both areas: the mark of a soul in
readiness—indomitable.</p>
<p>(Maximus’s illness.)</p>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li>THE GODS</li>
</ol>
<p>That I had good grandparents, a good mother and father, a good
sister, good teachers, good servants, relatives, friends—almost without
exception. And that I never lost control of myself with any of them,
although I had it in me to do that, and I might have, easily. But thanks
to the gods, I was never put in that position, and so escaped the
test.</p>
<p>That I wasn’t raised by my grandfather’s girlfriend for longer than I
was. That I didn’t lose my virginity too early, and didn’t enter
adulthood until it was time—put it off, even.</p>
<p>That I had someone—as a ruler and as a father—who could keep me from
being arrogant and make me realize that even at court you can live
without a troop of bodyguards, and gorgeous clothes, lamps,
sculpture—the whole charade. That you can behave almost like an ordinary
person without seeming slovenly or careless as a ruler or when carrying
out official obligations.</p>
<p>That I had the kind of brother I did. One whose character challenged
me to improve my own. One whose love and affection enriched my life.</p>
<p>That my children weren’t born stupid or physically deformed.</p>
<p>That I wasn’t more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other areas. If
I’d felt that I was making better progress I might never have given them
up.</p>
<p>That I conferred on the people who brought me up the honors they
seemed to want early on, instead of putting them off (since they were
still young) with the hope that I’d do it later.</p>
<p>That I knew Apollonius, and Rusticus, and Maximus.</p>
<p>That I was shown clearly and often what it would be like to live as
nature requires. The gods did all they could—through their gifts, their
help, their inspiration—to ensure that I could live as nature demands.
And if I’ve failed, it’s no one’s fault but mine. Because I didn’t pay
attention to what they told me—to what they taught me, practically, step
by step.</p>
<p>That my body has held out, especially considering the life I’ve
led.</p>
<p>That I never laid a finger on Benedicta or on Theodotus. And that
even later, when I was overcome by passion, I recovered from it.</p>
<p>That even though I was often upset with Rusticus I never did anything
I would have regretted later.</p>
<p>That even though she died young, at least my mother spent her last
years with me.</p>
<p>That whenever I felt like helping someone who was short of money, or
otherwise in need, I never had to be told that I had no resources to do
it with. And that I was never put in that position myself—of having to
take something from someone else.</p>
<p>That I have the wife I do: obedient, loving, humble.</p>
<p>That my children had competent teachers.</p>
<p>Remedies granted through dreams—when I was coughing blood, for
instance, and having fits of dizziness. And the one at Caieta.</p>
<p>That when I became interested in philosophy I didn’t fall into the
hands of charlatans, and didn’t get bogged down in writing treatises, or
become absorbed by logic-chopping, or preoccupied with physics.</p>
<p>All things for which “we need the help of fortune and the gods.”</p>
