<h4 id="introduction-notes">INTRODUCTION NOTES</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In this larger sense, rather than attempting to translate it, I
have generally left it simply as “(the) logos.” I hope that readers who
have assimilated such terms as “karma” and “the Tao” will be prepared to
welcome this one too.</p></li>
<li><p>So, too, some modern physicists have imagined a series of
universes produced by an alternation of expansions and contractions—“big
bangs” and “big crunches.”</p></li>
<li><p>Ramsay Macmullen, Enemies of the Roman Order (Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press, 1966), p. 48.</p></li>
<li><p>Earlier translators have been driven to clumsy equivalents such
as “Guiding Reason.” I have generally rendered it “mind,” as being
perhaps the least unsatisfactory English equivalent.</p></li>
<li><p>Two examples are worth pointing to. Marcus finds the gladiatorial
combat and the brutal executions of the arena a source of tedium (6.46);
that they might be morally wrong seems never to have occurred to him. He
prides himself on not having taken sexual advantage of his slaves, not
because it would have been harmful or unjust to them, but because such
self-indulgence would have been damaging to his own character (1.17).
There is no sign that he ever questioned slavery as an institution. If
asked, he would no doubt have responded that “true” slavery is the
self-enslavement of the mind to emotion and desire (cf. 8.3, 9.40,
11.30); actual bodily slavery is merely a condition to be accepted and
endured, like nearsightedness or a cold.</p></li>
<li><p>A still better title might be “Memoranda,” which suggests both
the miscellaneous character of the work and something about its intended
function. Scores of entries begin with the injunctions to “remember . .
.” or “keep in mind . . . ,” while the syntax of others (e.g., 12.18)
presupposes such an admonition.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to stress the self-directed nature of the Meditations I
have sometimes preferred to translate these as resolutions (“to . . .”)
rather than direct commands.</p></li>
<li><p>The conventional divisions and numbering go back only to the
Latin translation published by Thomas Gataker in 1652. It cannot be
regarded as authoritative, and I have occasionally split up a single
entry into two (sometimes following earlier editors, sometimes
not).</p></li>
<li><p>There are some striking omissions, which may or may not be
significant. Antoninus’s predecessor, Hadrian, is not mentioned, for
example. It may be that Marcus disapproved of him, or simply that he had
little contact with him before his death in 138. Perhaps more surprising
is the lack of any reference to Herodes Atticus, from whom Marcus
learned Greek rhetoric. Does this point to personal tensions that arose
between the two in later years? Or does the omission stem from Marcus’s
move away from rhetoric toward philosophy? (It is noteworthy that the
Latin rhetorician Fronto, with whom Marcus seems to have been close, is
allotted only a very brief entry in comparison with Marcus’s
philosophical preceptors.)</p></li>
<li><p>The openings of Books 2 and 3 differ from those that follow in
including a brief note to identify (presumably) the place of
composition. We do not know whether these notes go back to Marcus
himself, or why the other books lack them. The average length of the
entries in these two books is perhaps slightly longer than in the later
books, but there are few differences otherwise. Attempts to find a
thematic thread within Books 2 and 3 as a whole are not
convincing.</p></li>
<li><p>I have noted the most egregious instances in the notes, and have
marked with an obelus (&lt; . . . &gt;) a few passages where the
original is impossible to reconstruct.</p></li>
<li><p>William Alexander Percy, Lanterns on the Levee (Baton Rouge:
Louisiana State University Press, 1973), p. 313.</p></li>
<li><p>A survey of work on the predecessors and rivals of the Stoics is
obviously beyond the scope of this note, but two good starting points
may be mentioned. The surviving fragments of Heraclitus and other early
philosophers who appear in the Meditations are translated in Kathleen
Freeman, Ancilla to the Presocratic Philosophers (Oxford: Blackwell,
1948 and later reprints). Any reader unfamiliar with Plato should
probably begin with the Apology of Socrates, available in the Modern
Library’s Selected Dialogues of Plato, trans. B. Jowett, rev. H.
Pelliccia (New York: Random House, 2000) or any number of other
translations.</p></li>
