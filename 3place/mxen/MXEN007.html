<h4 id="the-meditations-genre-structure-and-style">The MEDITATIONS:
Genre, Structure, and Style</h4>
<p>I suspect that Marcus would have been surprised (and perhaps rather
dismayed) to find himself enshrined in the Modern Library of the World’s
Best Books. He would have been surprised, to begin with, by the title of
the work ascribed to him. The long-established English title Meditations
is not only not original, but positively misleading, lending a spurious
air of resonance and authority quite alien to the haphazard set of notes
that constitute the book. In the lost Greek manuscript used for the
first printed edition—itself many generations removed from Marcus’s
original—the work was entitled “To Himself” (Eis heauton). This is no
more likely than Meditations to be the original title, though it is at
least a somewhat more accurate description of the work.6</p>
<p>In fact, it seems unlikely that Marcus himself gave the work any
title at all, for the simple reason that he did not think of it as an
organic whole in the first place. Not only was it not written for
publication, but Marcus clearly had no expectation that anyone but
himself would ever read it. The entries include a number of cryptic
references to persons or events that an ancient reader would have found
as unintelligible as we do. While a contemporary might have recognized
some of the figures mentioned in Meditations 8.25 or 12.27, for example,
no ancient reader could have known what was in the letter that Rusticus
wrote from Sinuessa (1.7), what Antoninus said to the customs agent at
Tusculum (1.16), or what happened to Marcus at Caieta (1.17). Elsewhere
Marcus reflects directly on his role as emperor, in terms that would be
quite irrelevant to anyone else. We find him worrying about the dangers
of becoming “imperialized” (6.30), reminding himself to speak simply in
the Senate (8.30), and reflecting on the unique position he occupies
(11.7). From these entries and others it seems clear that the “you” of
the text is not a generic “you,” but the emperor himself. “When you look
at yourself, see any of the emperors” (10.31).</p>
<p>How are we to categorize the Meditations? It is not a diary, at least
in the conventional sense. The entries contain little or nothing related
to Marcus’s day-to-day life: few names, no dates and, with two
exceptions, no places. It also lacks the sense of audience—the reader
over one’s shoulder—that tends to characterize even the most secretive
diarist. Some scholars have seen it as the basis for an unwritten larger
treatise, like Pascal’s Pensées or the notebooks of Joseph Joubert. Yet
the notes are too repetitive and, in a philosophical sense, too
elementary for that. The entries perhaps bear a somewhat closer
resemblance to the working notes of a practicing philosopher:
Wittgenstein’s Zettel, say, or the Cahiers of Simone Weil. Yet here,
too, there is a significant difference. The Meditations is not tentative
and exploratory, like the notes of Wittgenstein or Weil, and it contains
little or nothing that is original. It suggests not a mind recording new
perceptions or experimenting with new arguments, but one obsessively
repeating and reframing ideas long familiar but imperfectly
absorbed.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best description of the entries is that suggested by the
French scholar Pierre Hadot. They are “spiritual exercises” composed to
provide a momentary stay against the stress and confusion of everyday
life: a self-help book in the most literal sense. A revealing comment in
this context is Meditations 5.9, where Marcus reminds himself “not to
think of philosophy as your instructor, but as the sponge and egg white
that relieve ophthalmia—as a soothing ointment.” On this reading, the
individual entries were composed not as a record of Marcus’s thoughts or
to enlighten others, but for his own use, as a means of practicing and
reinforcing his own philosophical convictions. Such an interpretation
accounts for several aspects of the entries that would otherwise be
puzzling. It explains the predominance of the imperative in the text;
its purpose is not to describe or reflect (let alone to “meditate”), but
to urge, direct, and exhort.7 And it explains also the repetitiveness
that strikes any reader of the work almost immediately—the continual
circling back to the same few problems. The entries do not present new
answers or novel solutions to these problems, but only familiar answers
reframed. It was precisely this process of reframing and reexpressing
that Marcus found helpful.</p>
<p>The recognition that the entries are as much process as product also
accounts for the shapelessness and apparent disorder of the work. We do
not know by whom or on what basis the individual books of the
Meditations were arranged; the order may be chronological, or partly
chronological, or wholly arbitrary. The arrangement of the individual
entries may or may not be Marcus’s own, though its very randomness
suggests that it goes back to the author (a later editor would have been
tempted to group together thematically similar entries, and perhaps to
tie up some of the more obvious loose ends). Nor can we always be sure
where individual entries begin and end; in some cases this is a question
Marcus himself might not have been able to answer.8</p>
<p>A special position is occupied by Book 1, which is distinguished from
the rest of the work by its autobiographical nature and by the greater
impression of conscious design and ordering apparent in it. It consists
of seventeen entries in which Marcus reflects on what he learned from
various individuals in his life, either directly or from their example
(hence the title I have given the section here, “Debts and Lessons,”
which has no warrant in the transmitted text). The entries roughly
mirror the chronology of Marcus’s early life, from his older relatives
to his teachers to his adopted father, Antoninus, and ultimately to the
gods.9 This logical schema, as well as the increasing length of the
entries, suggests deliberate arrangement, presumably by Marcus himself.
If so, then this book, at least, was conceived as an organic whole. It
may be among the latest portions of the text, if scholars are correct in
thinking (as most do) that the short sketch of Antoninus Pius in
Meditations 6.30 was the starting point for the longer memoir in
1.16.</p>
<p>Attempts to find organic unity in the remaining books or development
from book to book are doomed to failure. Wherever one opens the
Meditations (with the exception of Book 1) we find the same voice, the
same themes; Marcus’s thought does not change or develop noticeably from
one book to another. Nor can any structure or unity be discerned within
individual books. It seems most likely that the division between books
is a purely physical one. The transmitted “books,” in other words,
represent the individual papyrus rolls of Marcus’s original, or perhaps
of a later copy. When one had been filled, another was begun.10</p>
<p>If the books as a whole are homogenous, the individual entries show
considerable formal variety. Some are developed short essays that make a
single philosophical point; many of the entries in Books 2 and 3 are of
this type. Others are straightforward imperatives (“Take the shortest
route . . .”) or aphorisms (“no one can keep you from living in harmony
with yourself”). Sometimes Marcus will list a number of basic principles
in catalogue format (“remember that . . . and that . . . and that . .
.”). Elsewhere he puts forward an analogy, sometimes with the point of
comparison left to be inferred. Thus human lives are like “many lumps of
incense on the same altar” (4.15) or like “a rock thrown in the air”
(9.17). In other cases the analogy will be made explicit: “Have you ever
seen a severed hand or foot . . . ? That’s what we do to ourselves . . .
when we rebel against what happens to us” (8.34). Others present a kind
of formal meditative exercise, as when Marcus instructs himself to
imagine the age of Vespasian (4.32) or Augustus’s court (8.31) and then
to compare the imagined scene with that of his own time. Portions of two
books (7 and 11) consist simply of quotations. Some entries appear to be
rough drafts for others; several of the raw quotations from tragedies in
Book 7 are incorporated in the much more polished Meditations 11.6. The
significance of some entries remains completely obscure. Few critics
have known what to make of notes like “Character: dark, womanish,
obstinate” (4.28) or “They don’t realize how much is included in
stealing, sowing, buying . . .” (3.15).</p>
<p>The entries also differ considerably in the degree of artistry they
display. Some entries are little more than Marcus’s notes or reminders
to himself—the philosophical equivalent of “Phone Dr. re appt. Tues.?”
But others are highly literary. Marcus wrote as a man trained in the
rhetorical techniques of the second century. His thoughts naturally took
on the impress of his training and intellectual milieu even when he was
writing for himself alone.</p>
<p>The shorter entries often display an interest in wordplay and a
striving for epigrammatic brevity that recalls both the ingenuity of the
rhetorical schools and the paradoxical compression of Heraclitus:</p>
<p>Does the sun try to do the rain’s work? Or Asclepius Demeter’s?
(6.43)</p>
<p>Evil: the same old thing. (7.1)</p>
<p>Not a dancer but a wrestler . . . (7.61)</p>
<p>To accept it without arrogance, to let it go with indifference.
(8.33)</p>
<p>The philosophical tradition may have been influential on another
element that we find occasionally: the intermittent snatches of dialogue
or quasi-dialogue. As a developed form, the philosophical dialogue goes
back to Plato, who was imitated by later philosophers, notably Aristotle
(in his lost works) and Cicero. The Meditations certainly does not
contain the kind of elaborate scene setting that we expect in a true
dialogue, but we do find in a number of entries a kind of internal
debate in which the questions or objections of an imaginary interlocutor
are answered by a second, calmer voice which corrects or rebukes its
errors. The first voice seems to represent Marcus’s weaker, human side;
the second is the voice of philosophy.</p>
<p>The longer entries (none, of course, are very long) are marked by a
coherent if sometimes slightly labored style. Not all critics have had
kind words for Marcus’s expository prose, and some have been inclined to
attribute perceived shortcomings to deficiencies in his Greek. But in
all likelihood the occasional awkwardness is due less to an imperfect
grasp of the language than to roughness of composition—Marcus thinking
aloud or groping for an idea. The same explanation may underlie one of
the most noticeable features of Marcus’s prose—namely, his tendency to
string together pairs of near-synonymous words and phrases, as if
uncertain whether he has hit the target the first time. When combined
with the very abstract vocabulary natural in philosophical prose, this
can make for difficult reading, especially in English, which privileges
concision and concrete vocabulary to a greater degree than Greek. At its
best, however, Marcus’s writing can be extraordinarily effective, most
of all when it strikes a balance between image and idea, as in the
opening of 5.23:</p>
<p>Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone—those that are now,
and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the “what” is
in constant flux, the “why” has a thousand variations. Nothing is
stable, not even what’s right here. The infinity of past and future
gapes before us—a chasm whose depths we cannot see.</p>
<p>This particular topic—the transience of human life, the constant
change that shapes and informs the world—is a recurrent theme in the
Meditations, and as we shall see, it is one whose treatment owes as much
to literary as to philosophical models, and as much to Marcus’s own
character as to Stoic doctrine.</p>
