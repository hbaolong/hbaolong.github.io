<h4 id="later-influence">Later Influence</h4>
<p>How or by whom the Meditations was preserved is unknown. The
late-fourth-century Historia Augusta paints a picture of Marcus
lecturing on the Meditations to a spellbound audience at Rome—one of the
charming fantasies in which that peculiar work abounds, but certainly an
invention. The passage does suggest, however, that the text was in
circulation by the fourth century, when it is also mentioned by the
orator Themistius. It was very likely familiar also to a contemporary of
Themistius’s, the neo-pagan emperor Julian (known to later ages as
Julian the Apostate), in whose dialogue “The Caesars” Marcus is pictured
as a model for the kind of philosopher-king that Julian himself aspired
to be.</p>
<p>The century that followed Themistius and Julian was one of decline,
at least in the West—decline in political institutions, and also in the
knowledge of Greek. For the next thousand years Marcus’s work, like that
of Homer and Euripides, would remain unknown to Western readers. Copies
survived in the Greek-speaking East, of course, but even there the
Meditations seems to have been little read. For centuries, all trace of
it is lost, until at the beginning of the tenth century it reappears in
a letter from the scholar and churchman Arethas, who writes to a friend,
“I have had for a while now a copy of the Emperor Marcus’s invaluable
book. It was not only old but practically coming apart. . . . I have had
it copied and can now pass it on to posterity in better shape.” Whether
Arethas’s copy was indeed responsible for the work’s survival we do not
know. At any rate, its readership seems to have increased in the
centuries that followed. It is quoted a generation or two later by the
vast Byzantine encyclopedia known as the Suda, and it was perhaps around
this period also that an unknown Byzantine poet composed a brief
appreciation that came to be copied along with the text:</p>
<p>ON THE BOOK OF MARCUS</p>
<p>If you desire to master pain</p>
<p>Unroll this book and read with care,</p>
<p>And in it find abundantly</p>
<p>A knowledge of the things that are,</p>
<p>Those that have been, and those to come.</p>
<p>And know as well that joy and grief</p>
<p>Are nothing more than empty smoke.</p>
<p>The fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453 led to an exodus of
scholars, bringing with them the Greek texts that inspired the Italian
Renaissance. The Meditations must have been among them. Yet even at this
date the work’s survival hung by a thread. The only complete manuscript
to survive is a fourteenth-century codex (now in the Vatican), which is
riddled with errors. The first printed edition did not appear until
1559, when Wilhelm Holzmann (known as Xylander) produced a text from
what seems to have been a more reliable manuscript. That manuscript,
unfortunately, has not survived. But even at its best it was a very
imperfect witness to what Marcus himself wrote. Our text of the
Meditations contains a number of passages that are garbled or in which
one or more crucial words seem to have been omitted. Some of these
errors may be due to the confused state of Marcus’s original copy.
Others may have been accidentally introduced in the course of the
copying and recopying that the work underwent in the millennium
following Marcus’s death. In some cases the informed guesswork of
scholars over several centuries has been able to restore the original
text. In others, there is still uncertainty.11</p>
<p>The Meditations has never attracted great interest from professional
students of the classics, and the reasons are perhaps understandable. It
contains few direct references to historical events and provides
relatively little material for social historians. As evidence for later
Stoicism it pales beside the greater bulk of Epictetus’s Discourses. Yet
it has always exerted a fascination on those outside the narrow orbit of
classical study, perhaps especially on those who can best appreciate the
pressures that Marcus himself faced. The Meditations was among the
favorite reading of Frederick the Great; a recent American president has
claimed to reread it every few years. But it has attracted others too,
from poets like Pope, Goethe, and Arnold to the southern planter William
Alexander Percy, who observed in his autobiography that “there is left
to each of us, no matter how far defeat pierces, the unassailable wintry
kingdom of Marcus Aurelius. . . . It is not outside, but within, and
when all is lost, it stands fast.”12</p>
<p>If Marcus has been studied less than many ancient authors, he has
been translated more than most. But it has been a generation since his
last English incarnation, and the time seems ripe for another attempt.
My intention in what follows has been to represent in readable English
both the content and the texture of the Meditations. I have been
especially concerned to convey the patchwork character of the original,
both the epigrammatic concision that characterizes some entries and the
straggling discursiveness of others. I hope the results will bear out my
conviction that what a Roman emperor wrote long ago for his own use can
still be meaningful to those far removed from him in time and space. We
do not live in Marcus’s world, but it is not as remote from us as we
sometimes imagine. There could be no better witness to the effect of the
Meditations on a modern reader than the Russian poet Joseph Brodsky,
whose essay “Homage to Marcus Aurelius” takes its departure from the
famous statue of the emperor on the Capitoline hill in Rome:</p>
<p>I saw him for the last time a few years ago, on a wet winter night,
in the company of a stray Dalmatian. I was returning by taxi to my hotel
after one of the most disastrous evenings in my entire life. The next
morning I was leaving Rome for the States. I was drunk. The traffic
moved with the speed one wishes for one’s funeral. At the foot of the
Capitol I asked the driver to stop, paid, and got out of the car. . . .
Presently I discovered I was not alone: a middle-sized Dalmatian
appeared out of nowhere and quietly sat down a couple of feet away. Its
sudden presence was so oddly comforting that momentarily I felt like
offering it one of my cigarettes. . . . For a while we both stared at
the horseman’s statue. . . . And suddenly—presumably because of the rain
and the rhythmic pattern of Michelangelo’s pilasters and arches—all got
blurred, and against that blur, the shining statue, devoid of any
geometry, seemed to be moving. Not at great speed, and not out of this
place; but enough for the Dalmatian to leave my side and follow the
bronze progress.</p>
