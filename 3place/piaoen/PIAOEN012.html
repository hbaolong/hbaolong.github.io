<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>ON AN AFTERNOON of the following week, Scarlett came home from the
hospital weary and indignant. She was tired from standing on her feet
all morning and irritable because Mrs. Merriwether had scolded her
sharply for sitting on a soldier’s bed while she dressed his wounded
arm. Aunt Pitty and Melanie, bonneted in their best were on the porch
with Wade and Prissy, ready for their weekly round of calls. Scarlett
asked to be excused from accompanying them and went upstairs to her
room.</p>
<p>When the last sound of carriage wheels had died away and she knew the
family was safely out of sight she slipped quietly into Melanie’s room
and turned the key in the lock. It was a prim, virginal little room and
it lay still and warm in the slanting rays of the four-o’clock sun. The
floors were glistening and bare except for a few bright rag rugs, and
the white walls unornamented save for one corner which Melanie had
fitted up as a shrine.</p>
<p>Here, under a draped Confederate flag, hung the gold-hilted saber
that Melanie’s father had carried in the Mexican War, the same saber
Charles had worn away to war. Charles’ sash and pistol belt hung there
too, with his revolver in the holster. Between the saber and the pistol
was a daguerreotype of Charles himself, very stiff and proud in his gray
uniform, his great brown eyes shining out of the frame and a shy smile
on his lips.</p>
<p>Scarlett did not even glance at the picture but went unhesitatingly
across the room to the square rosewood writing box that stood on the
table beside the narrow bed. From it she took a pack of letters tied
together with a blue ribbon, addressed in Ashley’s hand to Melanie. On
the top was the letter which had come that morning and this one she
opened.</p>
<p>When Scarlett first began secretly reading these letters, she had
been so stricken of conscience and so fearful of discovery she could
hardly open the envelopes for trembling. Now, her never-too-scrupulous
sense of honor was dulled by repetition of the offense and even fear of
discovery had subsided. Occasionally, she thought with a sulking heart,
“What would Mother say if she knew?” She knew Ellen would rather see her
dead than know her guilty of such dishonor. This had worried Scarlett at
first, for she still wanted to be like her mother in every respect. But
the temptation to read the letters was too great and she put the thought
of Ellen out of her mind. She had become adept at putting unpleasant
thoughts out of her mind these days. She had learned to say, “I won’t
think of this or that bothersome thought now. I’ll think about it
tomorrow. Generally when tomorrow came, the thought either did not occur
at all or it was so attenuated by the delay it was not very troublesome.
So the matter of Ashley’s letters did not lie very heavily on her
conscience.</p>
<p>Melanie was always generous with the letters, reading parts of them
aloud to Aunt Pitty and Scarlett. But it was the part she did not read
that tormented Scarlett, that drove her to surreptitious reading of her
sister-in-law’s mail. She had to know if Ashley had come to love his
wife since marrying her. She had to know if he even pretended to love
her. Did he address tender endearments to her? What sentiments did he
express and with what warmth?</p>
<p>She carefully smoothed out the letter.</p>
<p>Ashley’s small even writing leaped up at her as she read, “My dear
wife,” and she breathed in relief. He wasn’t calling Melanie “Darling”
or “Sweetheart” yet.</p>
<p>“My Dear wife: You write me saying you are alarmed lest I be
concealing my real thoughts from you and you ask me what is occupying my
mind these days —”</p>
<p>“Mother of God!” thought Scarlett, in a panic of guilt “ ‘Concealing
his real thoughts.’ Can Melly have read his mind? Or my mind? Does she
suspect that he and I —”</p>
<p>Her hands trembled with fright as she held the letter closer, but as
she read the next paragraph she relaxed.</p>
<p>“Dear Wife, if I have concealed aught from you it is because I did
not wish to lay a burden on your shoulders, to add to your worries for
my physical safety with those of my mental turmoil. But I can keep
nothing from you, for you know me too well. Do not be alarmed. I have no
wound. I have not been ill. I have enough to eat and occasionally a bed
to sleep in. A soldier can ask for no more. But, Melanie, heavy thoughts
lie on my heart and I will open my heart to you.</p>
<p>“These summer nights I lie awake, long after the camp is sleeping,
and I look up at the stars and, over and over, I wonder, ‘Why are you
here, Ashley Wilkes? What are you fighting for?’</p>
<p>“Not for honor and glory, certainly. War is a dirty business and I do
not like dirt. I am not a soldier and I have no desire to seek the
bubble reputation even in the cannon’s mouth. Yet, here I am at the wars
— whom God never intended to be other than a studious country gentleman.
For, Melanie, bugles do not stir my blood nor drums entice my feet and I
see too clearly that we have been betrayed, betrayed by our arrogant
Southern selves, believing that one of us could whip a dozen Yankees,
believing that King Cotton could rule the world. Betrayed, too, by words
and catch phrases, prejudices and hatreds coming from the mouths of
those highly placed, those men whom we respected and revered — ‘King
Cotton, Slavery, States’ Rights, Damn Yankees.’</p>
<p>“And so when I lie on my blanket and look up at the stars and say
‘What are you fighting for?’ think of States’ Rights and cotton and the
darkies and the Yankees whom we have been bred to hate, and I know that
none of these is the reason why I am fighting. Instead, I see Twelve
Oaks and remember how the moonlight slants across the white columns, and
the unearthly way the magnolias look, opening under the moon, and how
the climbing roses make the side porch shady even at the hottest noon.
And I see Mother, sewing there, as she did when I was a little boy. And
I hear the darkies coming home across the fields at dusk, tired and
singing and ready for supper, and the sound of the windlass as the
bucket goes down into the cool well. And there’s the long view down the
road to the river, across the cotton fields, and the mist rising from
the bottom lands in the twilight. And that is why I’m here who have no
love of death or misery or glory and no hatred for anyone. Perhaps that
is what is called patriotism, love of home and country. But Melanie, it
goes deeper than that. For, Melanie, these things I have named are but
the symbols of the thing for which I risk my life, symbols of the kind
of life I love. For I am fighting for the old days, the old ways I love
so much but which, I fear, are now gone forever, no matter how the die
may fall. For, win or lose, we lose just the same.</p>
<p>“If we win this war and have the Cotton Kingdom of our dreams, we
still have lost, for we will become a different people and the old quiet
ways will go. The world will be at our doors clamoring for cotton and we
can command our own price. Then, I fear, we will become like the
Yankees, at whose money-making activities, acquisitiveness and
commercialism we now sneer. And if we lose, Melanie, if we lose!</p>
<p>“I am not afraid of danger or capture or wounds or even death, if
death must come, but I do fear that once this war is over, we will never
get back to the old times. And I belong in those old times. I do not
belong in this mad present of killing and I fear I will not fit into any
future, try though I may. Nor will you, my dear, for you and I are of
the same blood. I do not know what the future will bring, but it cannot
be as beautiful or as satisfying as the past.</p>
<p>“I lie and look at the boys sleeping near me and I wonder if the
twins or Alex or Cade think these same thoughts. I wonder if they know
they are fighting for a Cause that was lost the minute the first shot
was fired, for our Cause is really our own way of living and that is
gone already. But I do not think they think these things and they are
lucky.</p>
<p>“I had not thought of this for us when I asked you to marry me. I had
thought of life going on at Twelve Oaks as it had always done,
peacefully, easily, unchanging. We are alike, Melanie, loving the same
quiet things, and I saw before us a long stretch of uneventful years in
which to read, hear music and dream. But not this! Never this! That this
could happen to us all, this wrecking of old ways, this bloody slaughter
and hate! Melanie, nothing is worth it — States’ Rights, nor slaves, nor
cotton. Nothing is worth what is happening to us now and what may
happen, for if the Yankees whip us the future will be one of incredible
horror. And, my dear, they may yet whip us.</p>
<p>“I should not write those words. I should not even think them. But
you have asked me what was in my heart, and the fear of defeat is there.
Do you remember at the barbecue, the day our engagement was announced,
that a man named Butler, a Charlestonian by his accent, nearly caused a
fight by his remarks about the ignorance of Southerners? Do you recall
how the twins wanted to shoot him because he said we had few foundries
and factories, mills and ships, arsenals and machine shops? Do you
recall how he said the Yankee fleet could bottle us up so tightly we
could not ship out our cotton? He was right. We are fighting the
Yankees’ new rifles with Revolutionary War muskets, and soon the
blockade will be too tight for even medical supplies to slip in. We
should have paid heed to cynics like Butler who knew, instead of
statesmen who felt — and talked. He said, in effect, that the South had
nothing with which to wage war but cotton and arrogance. Our cotton is
worthless and what he called arrogance is all that is left. But I call
that arrogance matchless courage. If—”</p>
<p>But Scarlett carefully folded up the letter without finishing it and
thrust it back into the envelope, too bored to read further. Besides,
the tone of the letter vaguely depressed her with its foolish talk of
defeat. After all, she wasn’t reading Melanie’s mail to learn Ashley’s
puzzling and uninteresting ideas. She had had to listen to enough of
them when he sat on the porch at Tara in days gone by.</p>
<p>All she wanted to know was whether he wrote impassioned letters to
his wife. So far he had not. She had read every letter in the writing
box and there was nothing in any one of them that a brother might not
have written to a sister. They were affectionate, humorous, discursive,
but not the letters of a lover. Scarlett had received too many ardent
love letters herself not to recognize the authentic note of passion when
she saw it. And that note was missing. As always after her secret
readings, a feeling of smug satisfaction enveloped her, for she felt
certain that Ashley still loved her. And always she wondered sneeringly
why Melanie did not realize that Ashley only loved her as a friend.
Melanie evidently found nothing lacking in her husband’s messages but
Melanie had had no other man’s love letters with which to compare
Ashley’s”</p>
<p>“He writes such crazy letters,” Scarlett thought “If ever any husband
of mine wrote me such twaddle-twaddle, he’d certainly hear from me! Why,
even Charlie wrote better letters than these.”</p>
<p>She flipped back the edges of the letters, looking at the dates,
remembering their contents. In them there were no fine descriptive pages
of bivouacs and charges such as Darcy Meade wrote his parents or poor
Dallas McLure had written his old-maid sisters, Misses Faith and Hope.
The Meades and McLures proudly read these letters all over the
neighborhood, and Scarlett had frequently felt a secret shame that
Melanie had no such letters from Ashley to read aloud at sewing
circles.</p>
<p>It was as though when writing Melanie, Ashley tried to ignore the war
altogether, and sought to draw about the two of them a magic circle of
timelessness, shutting out everything that had happened since Fort
Sumter was the news of the day. It was almost as if he were trying to
believe there wasn’t any war. He wrote of books which he and Melanie had
read and songs they had sung, of old friends they knew and places he had
visited on his Grand Tour. Through the letters ran a wistful yearning to
be back home at Twelve Oaks, and for pages he wrote of the hunting and
the long rides through the still forest paths under frosty autumn stars,
the barbecues, the fish fries, the quiet of moonlight nights and the
serene charm of the old house.</p>
<p>She thought of his words in the letter she had just read: “Not this!
Never this!” and they seemed to cry of a tormented soul facing something
he could not face, yet must face. It puzzled her for, if he was not
afraid of wounds and death, what was it he feared? Unanalytical, she
struggled with the complex thought.</p>
<p>“The war disturbs him and he — he doesn’t like things that disturb
him. … Me, for instance. … He loved me but he was afraid to marry me
because — for fear I’d upset his way of thinking and living. No, it
wasn’t exactly that he was afraid. Ashley isn’t a coward. He couldn’t be
when he’s been mentioned in dispatches and when Colonel Sloan wrote that
letter to Melly all about his gallant conduct in leading the charge.
Once he’s made up his mind to do something, no one could be braver or
more determined but — He lives inside his head instead of outside in the
world and he hates to come out into the world and — Oh, I don’t know
what it is! If I’d just understood this one thing about him years ago, I
know he’d have married me.”</p>
<p>She stood for a moment holding the letters to her breast, thinking
longingly of Ashley. Her emotions toward him had not changed since the
day when she first fell in love with him. They were the same emotions
that struck her speechless that day when she was fourteen years old and
she had stood on the porch of Tara and seen Ashley ride up smiling, his
hair shining silver in the morning sun. Her love was still a young
girl’s adoration for a man she could not understand, a man who possessed
all the qualities she did not own but which she admired. He was still a
young girl’s dream of the Perfect Knight and her dream asked no more
than acknowledgment of his love, went no further than hopes of a
kiss.</p>
<p>After reading the letters, she felt certain he did love her,
Scarlett, even though he had married Melanie, and that certainty was
almost all that she desired. She was still that young and untouched. Had
Charles with his fumbling awkwardness and his embarrassed intimacies
tapped any of the deep vein of passionate feeling within her, her dreams
of Ashley would not be ending with a kiss. But those few moonlight
nights alone with Charles had not touched her emotions or ripened her to
maturity. Charles had awakened no idea of what passion might be or
tenderness or true intimacy of body or spirit.</p>
<p>All that passion meant to her was servitude to inexplicable male
madness, unshared by females, a painful and embarrassing process that
led inevitably to the still more painful process of childbirth. That
marriage should be like this was no surprise to her. Ellen had hinted
before the wedding that marriage was something women must bear with
dignity and fortitude, and the whispered comments of other matrons since
her widowhood had confirmed this. Scarlett was glad to be done with
passion and marriage.</p>
<p>She was done with marriage but not with love, for her love for Ashley
was something different, having nothing to do with passion or marriage,
something sacred and breathtakingly beautiful, an emotion that grew
stealthily through the long days of her enforced silence, feeding on
oft-thumbed memories and hopes.</p>
<p>She sighed as she carefully tied the ribbon about the packet,
wondering for the thousandth time just what it was in Ashley that eluded
her understanding. She tried to think the matter to some satisfactory
conclusion but, as always, the conclusion evaded her uncomplex mind. She
put the letters back in the lap secretary and closed the lid. Then she
frowned, for her mind went back to the last part of the letter she had
just read, to his mention of Captain Butler. How strange that Ashley
should be impressed, by something that scamp had said a year ago.
Undeniably Captain Butler was a scamp, for all that he danced divinely.
No one but a scamp would say the things about the Confederacy that he
had said at the bazaar.</p>
<p>She crossed the room to the mirror and parted her smooth hair
approvingly. Her spirits rose, as always at the sight of her white skin
and slanting green eyes, and she smiled to bring out her dimples. Then
she dismissed Captain Butler from her mind as she happily viewed her
reflection, remembering how Ashley had always liked her dimples. No pang
of conscience at loving another woman’s husband or reading that woman’s
mail disturbed her pleasure in her youth and charm and her renewed
assurance of Ashley’s love.</p>
<p>She unlocked the door and went down the dim winding stair with a
light heart. Halfway down she began singing “When This Cruel War Is
Over.”</p>
