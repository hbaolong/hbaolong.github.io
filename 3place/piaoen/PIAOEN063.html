<h4 id="chapter-lxii">CHAPTER LXII</h4>
<p>SHE HEARD whispering voices outside, and going to the door she saw
the frightened negroes standing in the back hall, Dilcey with her arms
sagging under the heavy weight of the sleeping Beau, Uncle Peter crying,
and Cookie wiping her wide wet face on her apron. All three looked at
her, dumbly asking what they were to do now. She looked up the hall
toward the sitting room and saw India and Aunt Pitty standing
speechless, holding each other’s hands and, for once, India had lost her
stiff-necked look. Like the negroes, they looked imploringly at her,
expecting her to give instructions. She walked into the sitting room and
the two women closed about her.</p>
<p>Oh, Scarlett, what —” began Aunt Pitty, her fat, child’s mouth
shaking.</p>
<p>“Don’t speak to me or I’ll scream,” said Scarlett. Overwrought nerves
brought sharpness to her voice and her hands clenched at her sides. The
thought of speaking of Melanie now, of making the inevitable
arrangements that follow a death made her throat tighten. “I don’t want
a word out of either of you.”</p>
<p>At the authoritative note in her voice, they fell back, helpless hurt
looks on their faces. “I mustn’t cry in front of them,” she thought. “I
mustn’t break now or they’ll begin crying too, and then the darkies will
begin screaming and we’ll all go mad. I must pull myself together.
There’s so much I’ll have to do. See the undertaker and arrange the
funeral and see that the house is clean and be here to talk to people
who’ll cry on my neck. Ashley can’t do them. I’ve got to do them. Oh,
what a weary load! It’s always been a weary load and always some one
else’s load!”</p>
<p>She looked at the dazed hurt faces of India and Pitty and contrition
swept her. Melanie would not like her to be so sharp with those who
loved her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I was cross,” she said, speaking with difficulty. “It’s
just that I — I’m sorry I was cross, Auntie. I’m going out on the porch
for a minute. I’ve got to be alone. Then I’ll come back and well —”</p>
<p>She patted Aunt Pitty and went swiftly by her to the front door,
knowing if she stayed in this room another minute her control would
crack. She had to be alone. And she had to cry or her heart would
break.</p>
<p>She stepped onto the dark porch and closed the door behind her and
the moist night air was cool upon her face. The rain had ceased and
there was no sound except for the occasional drip of water from the
eaves. The world was wrapped in a thick mist, a faintly chill mist that
bore on its breath the smell of the dying year. All the houses across
the street were dark except one, and the light from a lamp in the
window, falling into the street, struggled feebly with the fog, golden
particles floating in its rays. It was as if the whole world were
enveloped in an unmoving blanket of gray smoke. And the whole world was
still.</p>
<p>She leaned her head against one of the uprights of the porch and
prepared to cry but no tears came. This was a calamity too deep for
tears. Her body shook. There still reverberated in her mind the crashes
of the two impregnable citadels of her life, thundering to dust about
her ears. She stood for a while, trying to summon up her old charm:
“I’ll think of all this tomorrow when I can stand it better.” But the
charm had lost its potency. She had to think of two things, now —
Melanie and how much she loved and needed her; Ashley and the obstinate
blindness that had made her refuse to see him as he really was. And she
knew that thoughts of them would hurt just as much tomorrow and all the
tomorrows of her life.</p>
<p>“I can’t go back in there and talk to them now,” she thought. “I
can’t face Ashley tonight and comfort him. Not tonight! Tomorrow morning
I’ll come early and do the things I must do, say the comforting things I
must say. But not tonight. I can’t. I’m going home.”</p>
<p>Home was only five blocks away. She would not wait for the sobbing
Peter to harness the buggy, would not wait for Dr. Meade to drive her
home. She could not endure the tears of the one, the silent condemnation
of the other. She went swiftly down the dark front steps without her
coat or bonnet and into the misty night. She rounded the corner and
started up the long hill toward Peachtree Street, walking in a still wet
world, and even her footsteps were as noiseless as a dream.</p>
<p>As she went up the hill, her chest tight with tears that would not
come, there crept over her an unreal feeling, a feeling that she had
been in this same dim chill place before, under a like set of
circumstances — not once but many times before. How silly, she thought
uneasily, quickening her steps. Her nerves were playing her tricks. But
the feeling persisted, stealthily pervading her mind. She peered about
her uncertainly and the feeling grew, eerie but familiar, and her head
went up sharply like an animal scenting danger. It’s just that I’m worn
out, she tried to soothe herself. And the night’s so queer, so misty. I
never saw such thick mist before except — except!</p>
<p>And then she knew and fear squeezed her heart. She knew now. In a
hundred nightmares, she had fled through fog like this, through a
haunted country without landmarks, thick with cold cloaking mist,
peopled with clutching ghosts and shadows. Was she dreaming again or was
this her dream come true?</p>
<p>For an instant, reality went out of her and she was lost. The old
nightmare feeling was sweeping her, stronger than ever, and her heart
began to race. She was standing again amid death and stillness, even as
she had once stood at Tara. All that mattered in the world had gone out
of it, life was in ruins and panic howled through her heart like a cold
wind. The horror that was in the mist and was the mist laid hands upon
her. And she began to run. As she had run a hundred times in dreams, she
ran now, flying blindly she knew not where, driven by a nameless dread,
seeking in the gray mist for the safety that lay somewhere.</p>
<p>Up the dim street she fled, her head down, her heart hammering, the
night air wet on her lips, the trees overhead menacing. Somewhere,
somewhere in this wild land of moist stillness, there was a refuge! She
sped gasping up the long hill, her wet skirts wrapping coldly about her
ankles, her lungs bursting, the tight-laced stays pressing her ribs into
her heart.</p>
<p>Then before her eyes there loomed a light, a row of lights, dim and
flickering but none the less real. In her nightmare, there had never
been any lights, only gray fog. Her mind seized on those lights. Lights
meant safety, people, reality. Suddenly she stopped running, her hands
clenching, struggling to pull herself out of her panic, staring intently
at the row of gas lamps which had signaled to her brain that this was
Peachtree Street, Atlanta, and not the gray world of sleep and
ghosts.</p>
<p>She sank down panting on a carriage block, clutching at her nerves as
though they were ropes slipping swiftly through her hands.</p>
<p>“I was running — running like a crazy person!” she thought, her body
shaking with lessening fear, her thudding heart making her sick. “But
where was I running?”</p>
<p>Her breath came more easily now and she sat with her hand pressed to
her side and looked up Peachtree Street. There, at the top of the hill,
was her own house. It looked as though every window bore lights, lights
defying the mist to dim their brilliance. Home! It was real! She looked
at the dim far-off bulk of the house thankfully, longingly, and
something like calm fell on her spirit.</p>
<p>Home! That was where she wanted to go. That was where she was
running. Home to Rhett!</p>
<p>At this realization it was as though chains fell away from her and
with them the fear which had haunted her dreams since the night she
stumbled to Tara to find the world ended. At the end of the road to Tara
she had found security gone, all strength, all wisdom, all loving
tenderness, all understanding gone — all those things which, embodied in
Ellen, had been the bulwark of her girlhood. And, though she had won
material safety since that night, in her dreams she was still a
frightened child, searching for the lost security of that lost
world.</p>
<p>Now she knew the haven she had sought in dreams, the place of warm
safety which had always been bidden from her in the mist. It was not
Ashley—oh, never Ashley! There was no more warmth in him than in a marsh
light, no more security than in quicksand. It was Rhett — Rhett who had
strong arms to hold her, a broad chest to pillow her tired head, jeering
laughter to pull her affairs into proper perspective. And complete
understanding, because he, like her, saw truth as truth, unobstructed by
impractical notions of honor, sacrifice, or high belief in human nature.
He loved her! Why hadn’t she realized that he loved her, for all his
taunting remarks to the contrary? Melanie had seen it and with her last
breath had said, “Be kind to him.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” she thought, “Ashley’s not the only stupidly blind person. I
should have seen.”</p>
<p>For years she had had her back against the stone wall of Rhett’s love
and had taken it as much for granted as she had taken Melanie’s love,
flattering herself that she drew her strength from herself alone. And
even as she had realized earlier in the evening that Melanie had been
beside her in her bitter campaigns against life, now she knew that
silent in the background, Rhett had stood, loving her, understanding
her, ready to help. Rhett at the bazaar, reading her impatience in her
eyes and leading her out in the reel, Rhett helping her out of the
bondage of mourning, Rhett convoying her through the fire and explosions
the night Atlanta fell, Rhett lending her the money that gave her her
start, Rhett who comforted her when she woke in the nights crying with
fright from her dreams — why, no man did such things without loving a
woman to distraction!</p>
<p>The trees dripped dampness upon her but she did not feel it The mist
swirled about her and she paid it no heed. For when she thought of
Rhett, with his swarthy face, flashing teeth and dark alert eyes, a
trembling came over her.</p>
<p>“I love him,” she thought and, as always, she accepted the truth with
little wonder, as a child accepting a gift. “I don’t know how long I’ve
loved him but it’s true. And if it hadn’t been for Ashley, I’d have
realized it long ago. I’ve never been able to see the world at all,
because Ashley stood in the way.”</p>
<p>She loved him, scamp, blackguard, without scruple or honor — at least
honor as Ashley saw it “Damn Ashley’s honor!” she thought. “Ashley’s
honor has always let me down. Yes, from the very beginning when he kept
on coming to see me, even though he knew his family expected him to
marry Melanie. Rhett has never let me down, even that dreadful night of
Melly’s reception when he ought to have wrung my neck. Even when he left
me on the road the night Atlanta fell, he knew I’d be safe. He knew I’d
get through somehow. Even when he acted like he was going to make me pay
to get that money from him at the Yankee camp. He wouldn’t have taken
me. He was just testing me. He’s loved me all along and I’ve been so
mean to him. Time and again, I’ve hurt him and he was too proud to show
it. And when Bonnie died — Oh, how could I?”</p>
<p>She stood up straight and looked at the house on the hill. She had
thought, half an hour ago, that she had lost everything in the world,
except money, everything that made life desirable, Ellen, Gerald,
Bonnie, Mammy, Melanie and Ashley. She had to lose them all to realize
that she loved Rhett — loved him because he was strong and unscrupulous,
passionate and earthy, like herself.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell him everything,” she thought. “He’ll understand. He’s
always understood. I’ll tell him what a fool I’ve been and how much I
love him and I’ll make it up to him.”</p>
<p>Suddenly she felt strong and happy. She was not afraid of the
darkness or the fog and she knew with a singing in her heart that she
would never fear them again. No matter what mists might curl around her
in the future, she knew her refuge. She started briskly up the street
toward home and the blocks seemed very long. Far, far too long. She
caught up her skirts to her knees and began to run lightly. But this
time she was not running from fear. She was running because Rhett’s arms
were at the end of the street.</p>
