<h4 id="chapter-xxiii">CHAPTER XXIII</h4>
<p>AFTER PRISSY HAD GONE, Scarlett went wearily into the downstairs hall
and lit a lamp. The house felt steamingly hot, as though it held in its
walls all the heat of the noontide. Some of her dullness was passing now
and her stomach was clamoring for food. She remembered she had had
nothing to eat since the night before except a spoonful of hominy, and
picking up the lamp she went into the kitchen. The fire in the oven had
died but the room was stifling hot. She found half a pone of hard corn
bread in the skillet and gnawed hungrily on it while she looked about
for other food. There was some hominy left in the pot and she ate it
with a big cooking spoon, not waiting to put it on a plate. It needed
salt badly but she was too hungry to hunt for it. After four spoonfuls
of it, the heat of the room was too much and, taking the lamp in one
hand and a fragment of pone in the other, she went out into the
hall.</p>
<p>She knew she should go upstairs and sit beside Melanie. If anything
went wrong, Melanie would be too weak to call. But the idea of returning
to that room where she had spent so many nightmare hours was repulsive
to her. Even if Melanie were dying, she couldn’t go back up there. She
never wanted to see that room again. She set the lamp on the candle
stand by the window and returned to the front porch. It was so much
cooler here, and even the night was drowned in soft warmth. She sat down
on the steps in the circle of faint light thrown by the lamp and
continued gnawing on the corn bread.</p>
<p>When she had finished it, a measure of strength came back to her and
with the strength came again the pricking of fear. She could hear a
humming of noise far down the street, but what it portended she did not
know. She could distinguish nothing but a volume of sound that rose and
fell. She strained forward trying to hear and soon she found her muscles
aching from the tension. More than anything in the world she yearned to
hear the sound of hooves and to see Rhett’s careless, self-confident
eyes laughing at her fears. Rhett would take them away, somewhere. She
didn’t know where. She didn’t care.</p>
<p>As she sat straining her ears toward town, a faint glow appeared
above the trees. It puzzled her. She watched it and saw it grow
brighter. The dark sky became pink and then dull red, and suddenly above
the trees, she saw a huge tongue of flame leap high to the heavens. She
jumped to her feet, her heart beginning again its sickening thudding and
bumping.</p>
<p>The Yankees had come! She knew they had come and they were burning
the town. The flames seemed to be off to the east of the center of town.
They shot higher and higher and widened rapidly into a broad expanse of
red before her terrified eyes. A whole block must be burning. A faint
hot breeze that had sprung up bore the smell of smoke to her.</p>
<p>She fled up the stairs to her own room and hung out the window for a
better view. The sky was a hideous lurid color and great swirls of black
smoke went twisting up to hand in billowy clouds above the flames. The
smell of smoke was stronger now. Her mind rushed incoherently here and
there, thinking how soon the flames would spread up Peachtree Street and
burn this house, how soon the Yankees would be rushing in upon her,
where she would run, what she would do. All the fiends of hell seemed
screaming in her ears and her brain swirled with confusion and panic so
overpowering she clung to the window sill for support.</p>
<p>“I must think,” she told herself over and over. “I must think.”</p>
<p>But thoughts eluded her, darting in and out of her mind like
frightened humming birds. As she stood hanging to the sill, a deafening
explosion burst on her ears, louder than any cannon she had ever heard.
The sky was rent with gigantic flame. Then other explosions. The earth
shook and the glass in the panes above her head shivered and came down
around her.</p>
<p>The world became an inferno of noise and flame and trembling earth as
one explosion followed another in ear-splitting succession. Torrents of
sparks shot to the sky and descended slowly, lazily, through
blood-colored clouds of smoke. She thought she heard a feeble call from
the next room but she paid it no heed. She had no time for Melanie now.
No time for anything except a fear that licked through her veins as
swiftly as the flames she saw. She was a child and mad with fright and
she wanted to bury her head in her mother’s lap and shut out this sight.
If she were only home! Home with Mother.</p>
<p>Through the nerve-shivering sounds, she heard another sound, that of
fear-sped feet coming up the stairs three at a time, heard a voice
yelping like a lost hound. Prissy broke into the room and, flying to
Scarlett, clutched her arm in a grip that seemed to pinch out pieces of
flesh.</p>
<p>“The Yankees —” cried Scarlett.</p>
<p>“No’m, its our gempmums!” yelled Prissy between breaths, digging her
nails deeper into Scarlett’s arm. “Dey’s buhnin’ de foun’ry an’ de ahmy
supply depots an’ de wa’houses an’, fo’ Gawd, Miss Scarlett, dey done
set off dem sebenty freight cahs of cannon balls an’ gunpowder an’,
Jesus, we’s all gwine ter buhn up!”</p>
<p>She began yelping again shrilly and pinched Scarlett so hard she
cried out in pain and fury and shook off her hand.</p>
<p>The Yankees hadn’t come yet! There was still time to get away! She
rallied her frightened forces together.</p>
<p>“If I don’t get a hold on myself,” she thought, “I’ll be squalling
like a scalded cat!” and the sight of Prissy’s abject terror helped
steady her. She took her by the shoulders and shook her.</p>
<p>“Shut up that racket and talk sense. The Yankees haven’t come, you
fool! Did you see Captain Butler? What did he say? Is he coming?”</p>
<p>Prissy ceased her yelling but her teeth chattered.</p>
<p>“Yas’m, Ah finely foun’ him. In a bahroom, lak you told me. He —”</p>
<p>“Never mind where you found him. Is he coming? Did you tell him to
bring his horse?”</p>
<p>“Lawd, Miss Scarlett, he say our gempmums done tuck his hawse an’
cah’ige fer a amberlance.”</p>
<p>“Dear God in Heaven!”</p>
<p>“But he comin’ —”</p>
<p>“What did he say?”</p>
<p>Prissy had recovered her breath and a small measure of control but
her eyes still rolled.</p>
<p>“Well’m, lak you tole me, Ah foun’ him in a bahroom. Ah stood outside
an’ yell fer him an’ he come out. An’ ter-reckly he see me an’ Ah starts
tell him, de sojers tech off a sto’ house down Decatur Street an’ it
flame up an’ he say Come on an’ he grab me an’ we runs ter Fibe Points
an’ he say den: What now? Talk fas’. An’ Ah say you say, Cap’n Butler,
come quick an’ bring yo’ hawse an’ cah’ige. Miss Melly done had a chile
an’ you is bustin’ ter get outer town. An’ he say: Where all she
studyin’ ‘bout goin’? An’ Ah say: Ah doan know, suh, but you is boun’
ter go fo’ de Yankees gits hyah an’ wants him ter go wid you. An’ he
laugh an’ say dey done tuck his hawse.”</p>
<p>Scarlett’s heart went leaden as the last hope left her. Fool that she
was, why hadn’t she thought that the retreating army would naturally
take every vehicle and animal left in the city? For a moment she was too
stunned to hear what Prissy was saying but she pulled herself together
to hear the rest of the story.</p>
<p>“An’ den he say, Tell Miss Scarlett ter res’ easy. Ah’ll steal her a
hawse outer de ahmy crall effen dey’s ary one lef. An’ he say, Ah done
stole hawses befo’ dis night. Tell her Ah git her a hawse effen Ah gits
shot fer it. Den ‘he laugh agin an’ say, Cut an’ run home. An’ befo’ Ah
gits started Ker-bloom! Off goes a noise an’ Ah lak ter drap in mah
tracks an’ he tell me twarnt nuthin’ but de ammernition our gempmums
blowin’ up so’s de Yankees don’t git it an’ —”</p>
<p>“He is coming? He’s going to bring a horse?”</p>
<p>“So he say.”</p>
<p>She drew a long breath of relief. If there was any way of getting a
horse, Rhett Butler would get one. A smart man, Rhett. She would forgive
him anything if he got them out of this mess. Escape! And with Rhett she
would have no fear. Rhett would protect them. Thank God for Rhett! With
safety in view she turned practical.</p>
<p>“Wake Wade up and dress him and pack some clothes for an of us. Put
them in the small trunk. And don’t tell Miss Mellie we’re going. Not
yet. But wrap the baby in a couple of thick towels and be sure and pack
his clothes.”</p>
<p>Prissy still dang to her skirts and hardly anything showed in her
eyes except the whites. Scarlett gave her a shove and loosened her
grip.</p>
<p>“Hurry,” she cried, and Prissy went off like a rabbit.</p>
<p>Scarlett knew she should go in and quiet Melanie’s fear, knew Melanie
must be frightened out of her senses by the thunderous noises that
continued unabated and the glare that lighted the sky. It looked and
sounded like the end of the world.</p>
<p>But she could not bring herself to go back into that room just yet.
She ran down the stairs with some idea of packing up Miss Pittypat’s
china and the little silver she had left when she refugeed to Macon. But
when she reached the dining room, her hands were shaking so badly she
dropped three plates and shattered them. She ran out onto the porch to
listen and back again to the dining room and dropped the silver
clattering to the floor. Everything she touched she dropped. In her
hurry she slipped on the rag rug and fell to the floor with a jolt but
leaped up so quickly she was not even aware of the pain. Upstairs she
could hear Prissy galloping about like a wild animal and the sound
maddened her, for she was galloping just as aimlessly.</p>
<p>For the dozenth time, she ran out onto the porch but this time she
did not go back to her futile packing. She sat down. It was just
impossible to pack anything. Impossible to do anything but sit with
hammering heart and wait for Rhett. It seemed hours before he came. At
last, far up the road, she heard the protesting screech of unoiled axles
and the slow uncertain plodding of hooves. Why didn’t he hurry? Why
didn’t he make the horse trot?</p>
<p>The sounds came nearer and she leaped to her feet and called Rhett’s
name. Then, she saw him dimly as he climbed down from the seat of a
small wagon, heard the clicking of the gate as he came toward her. He
came into view and the light of the lamp showed him plainly. His dress
was as debonair as if he were going to a ball, well-tailored white linen
coat and trousers, embroidered gray watered-silk waistcoat and a hint of
ruffle on his shirt bosom. His wide Panama hat was set dashingly on one
side of his head and in the belt of his trousers were thrust two
ivory-handled, long-barreled dueling pistols. The pockets of his coat
sagged heavily with ammunition.</p>
<p>He came up the walk with the springy stride of a savage and his fine
head was carried like a pagan prince. The dangers of the night which had
driven Scarlett into panic had affected him like an intoxicant. There
was a carefully restrained ferocity in his dark face, a ruthlessness
which would have frightened her had she the wits to see it.</p>
<p>His black eyes danced as though amused by the whole affair, as though
the earth-splitting sounds and the horrid glare were merely things to
frighten children. She swayed toward him as he came up the steps, her
face white, her green eyes burning.</p>
<p>“Good evening,” he said, in his drawling voice, as he removed his hat
with a sweeping gesture. “Fine weather we’re having. I hear you’re going
to take a trip.”</p>
<p>“If you make any jokes, I shall never speak to you again,” she said
with quivering voice.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you are frightened!” He pretended to be surprised and
smiled in a way that made her long to push him backwards down the steep
steps.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am! I’m frightened to death and if you had the sense God gave
a goat, you’d be frightened too. But we haven’t got time to talk. We
must get out of here.”</p>
<p>“At your service, Madam. But just where were you figuring on going? I
made the trip out here for curiosity, just to see where you were
intending to go. You can’t go north or east or south or west The Yankees
are all around. There’s just one road out of town which the Yankees
haven’t got yet and the army is retreating by that road. And that road
won’t be open long. General Steve Lee’s cavalry is fighting a rear-guard
action at Rough and Ready to hold it open long enough for the army to
get away. If you follow the army down the McDonough road, they’ll take
the horse away from you and, while it’s not much of a horse, I did go to
a lot of trouble stealing it. Just where are you going?”</p>
<p>She stood shaking, listening to his words, hardly hearing them. But
at his question she suddenly knew where she was going, knew that all
this miserable day she had known where she was going. The only
place.</p>
<p>“I’m going home,” she said.</p>
<p>“Home? You mean to Tara?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes! To Tara! Oh, Rhett, we must hurry!”</p>
<p>He looked at her as if she had lost her mind.</p>
<p>“Tara? God Almighty, Scarlett! Don’t you know they fought all day at
Jonesboro? Fought for ten miles up and down the road from Rough and
Ready even into the streets of Jonesboro? The Yankees may be all over
Tara by now, all over the County. Nobody knows where they are but
they’re in that neighborhood. You can’t go home! You can’t go right
through the Yankee army!”</p>
<p>“I will go home!” she cried. “I will! I will!”</p>
<p>“You little fool,” and his voice was swift and rough. “You can’t go
that way. Even if you didn’t run into the Yankees, the woods are full of
stragglers and deserters from both armies. And lots of our troops are
still retreating from Jonesboro. They’d take the horse away from you as
quickly as the Yankees would. Your only chance is to follow the troops
down the McDonough road and pray that they won’t see you in the dark.
“You can’t go to Tara. Even if you got there, you’d probably find it
burned down. I won’t let you go home. It’s insanity.”</p>
<p>“I will go home!” she cried and her voice broke and rose to a scream.
“I will go home! You can’t stop me! I will go home! I want my mother!
I’ll kill you if you try to stop me! I will go home!”</p>
<p>Tears of fright and hysteria streamed down her face as she finally
gave way under the long strain. She beat on his chest with her fists and
screamed again: “I will! I will! If I have to walk every step of the
way!”</p>
<p>Suddenly she was in his arms, her wet cheek against the starched
ruffle of his shirt, her beating hands stilled against him. His hands
caressed her tumbled hair gently, soothingly, and his voice was gentle
too. So gentle, so quiet, so devoid of mockery, it did not seem Rhett
Butler’s voice at all but the voice of some kind strong stranger who
smelled of brandy and tobacco and horses, comforting smells because they
reminded her of Gerald.</p>
<p>“There, there, darling,” he said softly. “Don’t cry. You shall go
home, my brave little girl. You shall go home. Don’t cry.”</p>
<p>She felt something brush her hair and wondered vaguely through her
tumult if it were his lips. He was so tender, so infinitely soothing,
she longed to stay in his arms forever. With such strong arms about her,
surely nothing could harm her.</p>
<p>He fumbled in his pocket and produced a handkerchief and wiped her
eyes.</p>
<p>“Now, blow your nose like a good child,” he ordered, a glint of a
smile in his eyes, “and tell me what to do. We must work fast.”</p>
<p>She blew her nose obediently, still trembling, but she could not
think what to tell him to do. Seeing how her lip quivered and her eyes
looked up at him helplessly, he took command.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Wilkes has had her child? It will be dangerous to move her —
dangerous to drive her twenty-five miles in that rickety wagon. We’d
better leave her with Mrs. Meade.”</p>
<p>“The Meades aren’t home. I can’t leave her.”</p>
<p>“Very well. Into the wagon she goes. Where is that simple-minded
little wench?”</p>
<p>“Upstairs packing the trunk.”</p>
<p>“Trunk? You can’t take any trunk in that wagon. It’s almost too small
to hold all of you and the wheels are ready to come off with no
encouragement. Call her and tell her to get the smallest feather bed in
the house and put it in the wagon.”</p>
<p>Still Scarlett could not move. He took her arm in a strong grasp and
some of the vitality which animated him seemed to flow into her body. If
only she could be as cool and casual as he was! He propelled her into
the hall but she still stood helplessly looking at him. His lip went
down mockingly: “Can this be the heroic young woman who assured me she
feared neither God nor man?”</p>
<p>He suddenly burst into laughter and dropped her arm. Stung, she
glared at him, hating him.</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid,” she said.</p>
<p>“Yes, you are. In another moment you’ll be in a swoon and I have no
smelling salts about me.”</p>
<p>She stamped her foot impotently because she could not think of
anything else to do — and without a word picked up the lamp and started
up the stairs. He was close behind her and she could hear him laughing
softly to himself. That sound stiffened her spine. She went into Wade’s
nursery and found him sitting clutched in Prissy’s arms, half dressed,
hiccoughing quietly. Prissy was whimpering. The feather tick on Wade’s
bed was small and she ordered Prissy to drag it down the stairs and into
the wagon. Prissy put down the child and obeyed. Wade followed her down
the stairs, his hiccoughs stilled by his interest in the
proceedings.</p>
<p>“Come,” said Scarlett, turning to Melanie’s door and Rhett followed
her, hat in hand.</p>
<p>Melanie lay quietly with the sheet up to her chin. Her face was
deathly white but her eyes, sunken and black circled, were serene. She
showed no surprise at the sight of Rhett in her bedroom but seemed to
take it as a matter of course. She tried to smile weakly but the smile
died before it reached the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>“We are going home, to Tara,” Scarlett explained rapidly. “The
Yankees are coming. Rhett is going to take us. It’s the only way,
Melly.”</p>
<p>Melanie tried to nod her head feebly and gestured toward the baby.
Scarlett picked up the small baby and wrapped him hastily in a thick
towel. Rhett stepped to the bed.</p>
<p>“I’ll try not to hurt you,” he said quietly, tucking the sheet about
her. “See if you can put your arms around my neck.”</p>
<p>Melanie tried but they fell back weakly. He bent, slipped an arm
under her shoulders and another across her knees and lifted her gently.
She did not cry out but Scarlett saw her bite her lip and go even
whiter. Scarlett held the lamp high for Rhett to see and started toward
the door when Melanie made a feeble gesture toward the wall.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Rhett asked softly.</p>
<p>“Please,” Melanie whispered, trying to point. “Charles.”</p>
<p>Rhett looked down at her as if he thought her delirious but Scarlett
understood and was irritated. She knew Melanie wanted the daguerreotype
of Charles which hung on the wall below his sword and pistol.</p>
<p>“Please,” Melanie whispered again, “the sword.”</p>
<p>“Oh, all right,” said Scarlett and, after she had lighted Rhett’s
careful way down the steps, she went back and unhooked the sword and
pistol belts. It would be awkward, carrying them as well as the baby and
the lamp. That was just like Melanie, not to be at all bothered over
nearly dying and having the Yankees at her heels but to worry about
Charles’ things.</p>
<p>As she took down the daguerreotype, she caught a glimpse of Charles’
face. His large brown eyes met hers and she stopped for a moment to look
at the picture curiously. This man had been her husband, had lain beside
her for a few nights, had given her a child with eyes as soft and brown
as his. And she could hardly remember him.</p>
<p>The child in her arms waved small fists and mewed softly and she
looked down at him. For the first time, she realized that this was
Ashley’s baby and suddenly wished with all the strength left in her that
he were her baby, hers and Ashley’s.</p>
<p>Prissy came bounding up the stairs and Scarlett handed the child to
her. They went hastily down, the lamp throwing uncertain shadows on the
wall. In the hall, Scarlett saw a bonnet and put it on hurriedly, tying
the ribbons under her chin. It was Melanie’s black mourning bonnet and
it did not fit Scarlett’s head but she could not recall where she had
put her own bonnet.</p>
<p>She went out of the house and down the front steps, carrying the lamp
and trying to keep the saber from banging against her legs. Melanie lay
full length in the back of the wagon, and, beside her, were Wade and the
towel-swathed baby. Prissy climbed in and took the baby in her arms.</p>
<p>The wagon was very small and the boards about the sides very low. The
wheels leaned inward as if their first revolution would make them come
off. She took one look at the horse and her heart sank. He was a small
emaciated animal and he stood with his head dispiritedly low, almost
between his forelegs. His back was raw with sores and harness galls and
he breathed as no sound horse should.</p>
<p>“Not much of an animal, is it?” grinned Rhett. “Looks like he’ll die
in the shafts. But he’s the best I could do. Some day I’ll tell you with
embellishments just where and how I stole him and how narrowly I missed
getting shot. Nothing but my devotion to you would make me, at this
stage of my career, turn horse thief — and thief of such a horse. Let me
help you in.”</p>
<p>He took the lamp from her and set it on the ground. The front seat
was only a narrow plank across the sides of the wagon. Rhett picked
Scarlett up bodily and swung her to it. How wonderful to be a man and as
strong as Rhett, she thought, tucking her wide skirts about her. With
Rhett beside her, she did not fear anything, neither the fire nor the
noise nor the Yankees.</p>
<p>He climbed onto the seat beside her and picked up the reins.</p>
<p>“Oh, wait!” she cried. “I forgot to lock the front door.”</p>
<p>He burst into a roar of laughter and slapped the reins upon the
horse’s back.</p>
<p>“What are you laughing at?”</p>
<p>“At you — locking the Yankees out,” he said and the horse started
off, slowly, reluctantly. The lamp on the sidewalk burned on, making a
tiny yellow circle of light which grew smaller and smaller as they moved
away.</p>
<p>Rhett turned the horse’s slow feet westward from Peachtree and the
wobbling wagon jounced into the rutty lane with a violence that wrenched
an abruptly stilled moan from Melanie. Dark trees interlaced above their
heads, dark silent houses loomed up on either side and the white palings
of fences gleamed faintly like a row of tombstones. The narrow street
was a dim tunnel, but faintly through the thick leafy ceiling the
hideous red glow of the sky penetrated and shadows chased one another
down the dark way like mad ghosts. The smell of smoke came stronger and
stronger, and on the wings of the hot breeze came a pandemonium of sound
from the center of town, yells, the dull rumbling of heavy army wagons
and the steady tramp of marching feet. As Rhett jerked the horse’s head
and turned him into another street, another deafening explosion tore the
air and a monstrous skyrocket of flame and smoke shot up in the
west.</p>
<p>That must be the last of the ammunition trains,” Rhett said calmly.
“Why didn’t they get them out this morning, the fools! There was plenty
of time. Well, too bad for us. I thought by circling around the center
of town, we might avoid the fire and that drunken mob on Decatur Street
and get through to the southwest part of town without any danger. But
we’ve got to cross Marietta Street somewhere and that explosion was near
Marietta Street or I miss my guess.”</p>
<p>“Must — must we go through the fire?” Scarlett quavered.</p>
<p>“Not if we hurry,” said Rhett and, springing from the wagon, he
disappeared into the darkness of a yard. When he returned he had a small
limb of a tree in his hand and he laid it mercilessly across the horse’s
galled back. The animal broke into a shambling trot, his breath panting
and labored, and the wagon swayed forward with a jolt that threw them
about like popcorn in a popper. The baby wailed, and Prissy and Wade
cried out as they bruised themselves against the sides of the wagon. But
from Melanie there was no sound.</p>
<p>As they neared Marietta Street, the trees thinned out and the tall
flames roaring up above the buildings threw street and houses into a
glare of light brighter than day, casting monstrous shadows that twisted
as wildly as torn sails flapping in a gale on a sinking ship.</p>
<p>Scarlett’s teeth chattered but so great was her terror she was not
even aware of it. She was cold and she shivered, even though the heat of
the flames was already hot against their faces. This was hell and she
was in it and, if she could only have conquered her shaking knees, she
would have leaped from the wagon and run screaming back the dark road
they had come, back to the refuge of Miss Pittypat’s house. She shrank
closer to Rhett, took his arm in fingers that trembled and looked up at
him for words, for comfort, for something reassuring. In the unholy
crimson glow that bathed them, his dark profile stood out as clearly as
the head on an ancient coin, beautiful, cruel and decadent. At her touch
he turned to her, his eyes gleaming with a light as frightening as the
fire. To Scarlett, he seemed as exhilarated and contemptuous as if he
got strong pleasure from the situation, as if he welcomed the inferno
they were approaching.</p>
<p>“Here,” he said, laying a hand on one of the long-barreled pistols in
his belt. “If anyone, black or white, comes up on your side of the wagon
and tries to lay hand on the horse, shoot him and we’ll ask questions
later. But for God’s sake, don’t shoot the nag in your excitement.”</p>
<p>“I — I have a pistol,” she whispered, clutching the weapon in her
lap, perfectly certain that if death stared her in the face, she would
be too frightened to pull the trigger.</p>
<p>“You have? Where did you get it?”</p>
<p>“It’s Charles’.”</p>
<p>“Charles?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Charles — my husband.”</p>
<p>“Did you ever really have a husband, my dear?” he whispered and
laughed softly.</p>
<p>If he would only be serious! If he would only hurry!</p>
<p>“How do you suppose I got my boy?” she cried fiercely.</p>
<p>“Oh, there are other ways than husbands —”</p>
<p>“Will you hush and hurry?”</p>
<p>But he drew rein abruptly, almost at Marietta Street, in the shadow
of a warehouse not yet touched by the flames.</p>
<p>“Hurry!” It was the only word in her mind. Hurry! Hurry!</p>
<p>“Soldiers,” he said.</p>
<p>The detachment came down Marietta Street, between the burning
buildings, walking at route step, tiredly, rifles held any way, heads
down, too weary to hurry, too weary to care if timbers were crashing to
right and left and smoke billowing about them. They were all ragged, so
ragged that between officers and men there were no distinguishing
insignia except here and there a torn hat brim pinned up with a wreathed
“C.S.A.” Many were barefooted and here and there a dirty bandage wrapped
a head or arm. They went past, looking neither to left nor right, so
silent that had it not been for the steady tramp of feet they might all
have been ghosts.</p>
<p>“Take a good look at them,” came Rhett’s gibing voice, “so you can
tell your grandchildren you saw the rear guard of the Glorious Cause in
retreat.”</p>
<p>Suddenly she hated him, hated him with a strength that momentarily
overpowered her fear, made it seem petty and small. She knew her safety
and that of the others in the back of the wagon depended on him and him
alone, but she hated him for his sneering at those ragged ranks. She
thought of Charles who was dead and Ashley who might be dead and all the
gay and gallant young men who were rotting in shallow graves and she
forgot that she, too, had once thought them fools. She could not speak,
but hatred and disgust burned in her eyes as she stared at him
fiercely.</p>
<p>As the last of the soldiers were passing, a small figure in the rear
rank, his rifle butt dragging the ground, wavered, stopped and stared
after the others with a dirty face so dulled by fatigue he looked like a
sleepwalker. He was as small as Scarlett, so small his rifle was almost
as tall as he was, and his grime-smeared face was unbearded. Sixteen at
the most, thought Scarlett irrelevantly, must be one of the Home Guard
or a runaway schoolboy.</p>
<p>As she watched, the boy’s knees buckled slowly and he went down in
the dust. Without a word, two men fell out of the last rank and walked
back to him. One, a tall spare man with a black beard that hung to his
belt, silently handed his own rifle and that of the boy to the other.
Then, stooping, he jerked the boy to his shoulders with an ease that
looked like sleight of hand. He started off slowly after the retreating
column, his shoulders bowed under the weight, while the boy, weak,
infuriated like a child teased by its elders, screamed out: Put me down,
damn you! Put me down! I can walk!”</p>
<p>The bearded man said nothing and plodded on out of sight around the
bend of the road.</p>
<p>Rhett sat still, the reins lax in his hands, looking after them, a
curious moody look on his swarthy face. Then, there was a crash of
falling timbers near by and Scarlett saw a thin tongue of flame lick up
over the roof of the warehouse in whose sheltering shadow they sat. Then
pennons and battle flags of flame flared triumphantly to the sky above
them. Smoke burnt her nostrils and Wade and Prissy began coughing. The
baby made soft sneezing sounds.</p>
<p>“Oh, name of God, Rhett! Are you crazy? Hurry! Hurry!”</p>
<p>Rhett made no reply but brought the tree limb down on the horse’s
back with a cruel force that made the animal leap forward. With all the
speed the horse could summon, they jolted and bounced across Marietta
Street. Ahead of them was a tunnel of fire where buildings were blaring
on either side of the short, narrow street that led down to the railroad
tracks. They plunged into it. A glare brighter than a dozen suns dazzled
their eyes, scorching heat seared their skins and the roaring, crackling
and crashing beat upon their ears in painful waves. For an eternity, it
seemed, they were in the midst of flaming torment and then abruptly they
were in semidarkness again.</p>
<p>As they dashed down the street and bumped over the railroad tracks,
Rhett applied the whip automatically. His face looked set and absent, as
though he had forgotten where he was. His broad shoulders were hunched
forward and his chin jutted out as though the thoughts in his mind were
not pleasant. The heat of the fire made sweat stream down his forehead
and cheeks but he did not wipe it off.</p>
<p>They pulled into a side street, then another, then turned and twisted
from one narrow street to another until Scarlett completely lost her
bearings and the roaring of the flames died behind them. Still Rhett did
not speak. He only laid on the whip with regularity. The red glow in the
sky was fading now and the road became so dark, so frightening, Scarlett
would have welcomed words, any words from him, even jeering, insulting
words, words that cut. But he did not speak.</p>
<p>Silent or not, she thanked Heaven for the comfort of his presence. It
was so good to have a man beside her, to lean close to him and feel the
hard swell of his arm and know that he stood between her and unnamable
terrors, even though he merely sat there and stared.</p>
<p>“Oh, Rhett,” she whispered clasping his arm, “What would we ever have
done without you? I’m so glad you aren’t in the army!”</p>
<p>He turned his head and gave her one look, a look that made her drop
his arm and shrink back. There was no mockery in his eyes now. They were
naked and there was anger and something like bewilderment in them. His
lip curled down and he turned his head away. For a long time they
jounced along in a silence unbroken except for the faint wails of the
baby and sniffles from Prissy. When she was able to bear the sniffling
noise no longer, Scarlett turned and pinched her viciously, causing
Prissy to scream in good earnest before she relapsed into frightened
silence.</p>
<p>Finally Rhett turned the horse at right angles and after a while they
were on a wider, smoother road. The dim shapes of houses grew farther
and farther apart and unbroken woods loomed wall-like on either
side.</p>
<p>“We’re out of town now,” said Rhett briefly, drawing rein, “and on
the main road to Rough and Ready.”</p>
<p>“Hurry. Don’t stop!”</p>
<p>“Let the animal breathe a bit.” Then turning to her, he asked slowly:
“Scarlett, are you still determined to do this crazy thing?”</p>
<p>“Do what?’</p>
<p>“Do you still want to try to get through to Tara? It’s suicidal.
Steve Lee’s cavalry and the Yankee Army are between you and Tara.”</p>
<p>Oh, Dear God! Was he going to refuse to take her home, after all
she’d gone through this terrible day?</p>
<p>“Oh, yes! Yes! Please, Rhett, let’s hurry. The horse isn’t
tired.”</p>
<p>“Just a minute. You can’t go down to Jonesboro on this road. You
can’t follow the train tracks. They’ve been fighting up and down mere
all day from Rough and Ready on south. Do you know any other roads,
small wagon roads or lanes that don’t go through Rough and Ready or
Jonesboro?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes,” cried Scarlett in relief. “If we can just get near to
Rough and Ready, I know a wagon trace that winds off from the main
Jonesboro road and wanders around for miles. Pa and I used to ride it.
It comes out right near the Macintosh place and that’s only a mile from
Tara.”</p>
<p>“Good. Maybe you can get past Rough and Ready all right. General
Steve Lee was there during the afternoon covering the retreat Maybe the
Yankees aren’t there yet. Maybe you can get through there, if Steve
Lee’s men don’t pick up your horse.”</p>
<p>“I can get through?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you.” His voice was rough.</p>
<p>“But Rhett— You — Aren’t going to take us?”</p>
<p>“No. I’m leaving you here.”</p>
<p>She looked around wildly, at the livid sky behind them, at the dark
trees on either hand hemming them in like a prison wall, at the
frightened figures in the back of the wagon— and finally at him. Had she
gone crazy? Was she not hearing right?</p>
<p>He was grinning now. She could just see his white teeth in the faint
light and the old mockery was back in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Leaving us? Where— where are you going?”</p>
<p>“I am going, dear girl, with the army.”</p>
<p>She sighed with relief and irritation. Why did he joke at this time
of all times? Rhett in the army! After all he’d said about stupid fools
who were enticed into losing their lives by a roll of drums and brave
words from orators— fools who killed themselves that wise men might make
money!</p>
<p>“Oh, I could choke you for scaring me so! Let’s get on.”</p>
<p>I’m not joking, my dear. And I am hurt, Scarlett that you do not take
my gallant sacrifice with better spirit. Where is your patriotism, your
love for Our Glorious Cause? Now is your chance to tell me to return
with my shield or on it. But, talk fast, for I want time to make a brave
speech before departing for the wars.”</p>
<p>His drawling voice gibed in her ears. He was jeering at her and,
somehow, she knew he was jeering at himself too. What was he talking
about? Patriotism, shields, brave speeches? It wasn’t possible that he
meant what he was saying. It just wasn’t believable that he could talk
so blithely of leaving her here on this dark road with a woman who might
be dying, a new-born infant, a foolish black wench and a frightened
child, leaving her to pilot them through miles of battle fields and
stragglers and Yankees and fire and God knows what.</p>
<p>Once, when she was six years old, she had fallen from a tree, flat on
her stomach. She could still recall that sickening interval before
breath came back into her body. Now, as she looked at Rhett, she felt
the same way she had felt then, breathless, stunned, nauseated.</p>
<p>“Rhett, you are joking!”</p>
<p>She grabbed his arm and felt her tears of fright splash down her
wrist. He raised her hand and kissed it arily.</p>
<p>“Selfish to the end, aren’t you, my dear? Thinking only of your own
precious hide and not of the gallant Confederacy. Think how our troops
will be heartened by my eleventh-hour appearance.” There was a malicious
tenderness in his voice.</p>
<p>“Oh, Rhett,” she wailed, “how can you do this to me? Why are you
leaving me?”</p>
<p>“Why?” he laughed jauntily. “Because, perhaps, of the betraying
sentimentality that lurks in all of us Southerners. Perhaps— perhaps
because I am ashamed. Who knows?”</p>
<p>“Ashamed? You should die of shame. To desert us here, alone,
helpless—”</p>
<p>“Dear Scarlett! You aren’t helpless. Anyone as selfish and determined
as you are is never helpless. God help the Yankees if they should get
you.”</p>
<p>He stepped abruptly down from the wagon and, as she watched him,
stunned with bewilderment, he came around to her side of the wagon.</p>
<p>“Get out,” he ordered.</p>
<p>She stared at him. He reached up roughly, caught her under the arms
and swung her to the ground beside him. With a tight grip on her he
dragged her several paces away from the wagon. She felt the dust and
gravel in her slippers hurting her feet. The still hot darkness wrapped
her like a dream.</p>
<p>“I’m not asking you to understand or forgive. I don’t give a damn
whether you do either, for I shall never understand or forgive myself
for this idiocy. I am annoyed at myself to find that so much quixoticism
still lingers in me. But our fair Southland needs every man. Didn’t our
brave Governor Brown say just that? Not matter. I’m off to the wars.” He
laughed suddenly, a ringing, free laugh that startled the echoes in the
dark woods.</p>
<p>“ ‘I could not love thee, Dear, so much, loved I not Honour more.’
That’s a pat speech, isn’t it? Certainly better than anything I can
think up myself, at the present moment. For I do love you, Scarlett, in
spite of what I said that night on the porch last month.”</p>
<p>His drawl was caressing and his hands slid tip her bare arms, warm
strong hands. I love you, Scarlett, because we are so much alike,
renegades, both of us, dear, and selfish rascals. Neither of us cares a
rap if the whole world goes to pot so long as we are safe and
comfortable.”</p>
<p>His voice went on in the darkness and she heard words, but they made
no sense to her. Her mind was tiredly trying to take in the harsh truth
that he was leaving her here to face the Yankees alone. Her mind said:
“He’s leaving me. He’s leaving me.” But no emotion stirred.</p>
<p>Then his arms went around her waist and shoulders and she felt the
hard muscles of his thighs against her body and the buttons of his coat
pressing into her breast A warm tide of feeling, bewildering,
frightening, swept over her, carrying out of her mind the time and place
and circumstances. She felt as limp as a rag doll, warm, weak and
helpless, and his supporting arms were so pleasant.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to change your mind about what I said last month?
There’s nothing like danger and death to give an added fillip. Be
patriotic, Scarlett Think how you would be sending a soldier to his
death with beautiful memories.”</p>
<p>He was kissing her now and his mustache tickled her mouth, kissing
her with slow, hot lips that were so leisurely as though he had the
whole night before him. Charles had never kissed her like this. Never
had the kisses of the Tarleton and Calvert boys made her go hot and cold
and shaky like this. He bent her body backward and his lips traveled
down her throat to where the cameo fastened her basque.</p>
<p>“Sweet,” he whispered. “Sweet.”</p>
<p>She saw the wagon dimly in the dark and heard the treble piping of
Wade’s voice.</p>
<p>“Muvver! Wade fwightened!”</p>
<p>Into her swaying, darkened mind, cold sanity came back with a rush
and she remembered what she had forgotten for the moment— that she was
frightened too, and Rhett was leaving her, leaving her, the damned cad.
And on top of it all, he had the consummate gall to stand here in the
road and insult her with his infamous proposals. Rage and hate flowed
into her and stiffened her spine and with one wrench she tore herself
loose from his arms.</p>
<p>“Oh, you cad!” she cried and her mind leaped about, trying to think
of worse things to call him, things she had heard Gerald call
Mr. Lincoln, the Macintoshes and balky mules, but the words would not
come. “You low-down, cowardly, nasty, stinking thing!” And because she
could not think of anything crushing enough, she drew back her arm and
slapped him across the mouth with all the force she had left. He took a
step backward, his hand going to his face.</p>
<p>“Ah,” he said quietly and for a moment they stood facing each other
in the darkness. Scarlett could hear his heavy breathing, and her own
breath came in gasps as if she had been running hard.</p>
<p>“They were right! Everybody was right! You aren’t a gentleman!”</p>
<p>“My dear girl,” he said, “how inadequate.”</p>
<p>She knew he was laughing and the thought goaded her.</p>
<p>“Go on! Go on now! I want you to hurry. I don’t want to ever see you
again. I hope a cannon ball lands right on you. I hope it blows you to a
million pieces. I—”</p>
<p>“Never mind the rest. I follow your general idea. When I’m dead on
the altar of my country, I hope your conscience hurts you.”</p>
<p>She heard him laugh as he turned away and walked back toward the
wagon. She saw him stand beside it, heard him speak and his voice was
changed, courteous and respectful as it always was when he spoke to
Melanie.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Wilkes?”</p>
<p>Prissy’s frightened voice made answer from the wagon.</p>
<p>“Gawdlmighty. Cap’n Butler! Miss Melly done fainted away back
yonder.”</p>
<p>“She’s not dead? Is she breathing?”</p>
<p>“Yassuh, she breathin’.”</p>
<p>“Then she’s probably better off as she is. If she were conscious, I
doubt if she could live through all the pain. Take good care of her,
Prissy. Here’s a shinplaster for you. Try not to be a bigger fool than
you are.”</p>
<p>“Yassuh. Thankee suh.”</p>
<p>“Good-by, Scarlett.”</p>
<p>She knew he had turned and was facing her but she did not speak. Hate
choked all utterance. His feet ground on the pebbles of the road and for
a moment she saw his big shoulders looming up in the dark. Then he was
gone. She could hear the sound of his feet for a while and then they
died away. She came slowly back to the wagon, her knees shaking.</p>
<p>Why had he gone, stepping off into the dark, into the war, into a
Cause that was lost, into a world that was mad? Why had he gone, Rhett
who loved the pleasures of women and liquor, the comfort of good food
and soft beds, the feel of fine linen and good leather, who hated the
South and jeered at the fools who fought for it? Now he had set his
varnished boots upon a bitter road where hunger tramped with tireless
stride and wounds and weariness and heartbreak ran like yelping wolves.
And the end of the road was death. He need not have gone. He was safe,
rich, comfortable. But he had gone, leaving her alone in a night as
black as blindness, with the Yankee Army between her and home.</p>
<p>Now she remembered all the bad names she had wanted to call him but
it was too late. She leaned her head against the bowed neck of the horse
and cried.</p>
