<h4 id="chapter-lvii">CHAPTER LVII</h4>
<p>IT WAS A PALE, thin woman that Rhett put on the Jonesboro train a
month later. Wade and Ella, who were to make the trip with her, were
silent and uneasy at their mother’s still, white face. They clung close
to Prissy, for even to their childish minds there was something
frightening in the cold, impersonal atmosphere between their mother and
their stepfather.</p>
<p>Weak as she was, Scarlett was going home to Tara. She felt that she
would stifle if she stayed in Atlanta another day, with her tired mind
forcing itself round and round the deeply worn circle of futile thoughts
about the mess she was in. She was sick in body and weary in mind and
she was standing like a lost child in a nightmare country in which there
was no familiar landmark to guide her.</p>
<p>As she had once fled Atlanta before an invading army, so she was
fleeing it again, pressing her worries into the back of her mind with
her old defense against the world: “I won’t think of it now. I can’t
stand it if I do. I’ll think of it tomorrow at Tara. Tomorrow’s another
day.” It seemed that if she could only get back to the stillness and the
green cotton fields of home, all her troubles would fall away and she
would somehow be able to mold her shattered thoughts into something she
could live by.</p>
<p>Rhett watched the train until it was out of sight and on his face
there was a look of speculative bitterness that was not pleasant. He
sighed, dismissed the carriage and mounting his horse, rode down Ivy
Street toward Melanie’s house.</p>
<p>It was a warm morning and Melanie sat on the vine-shaded porch, her
mending basket piled high with socks. Confusion and dismay filled her
when she saw Rhett alight from his horse and toss the reins over the arm
of the cast-iron negro boy who stood at the sidewalk. She had not seen
him alone since that too dreadful day when Scarlett had been so ill and
he had been so — well — so drunk. Melanie hated even to think the word.
She had spoken to him only casually during Scarlett’s convalescence and,
on those occasions, she had found it difficult to meet his eyes.
However, he had been his usual bland self at those times, and never by
look or word showed that such a scene had taken place between them.
Ashley had told her once that men frequently did not remember things
said and done in drink and Melanie prayed heartily that Captain Butler’s
memory had failed him on that occasion. She felt she would rather die
than learn that he remembered his outpourings. Timidity and
embarrassment swept over her and waves of color mounted her cheeks as he
came up the walk. But perhaps he had only come to ask if Beau could
spend the day with Bonnie. Surely he wouldn’t have the bad taste to come
and thank her for what she had done that day!</p>
<p>She rose to meet him, noting with surprise, as always, how lightly he
walked for a big man.</p>
<p>“Scarlett has gone?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Tara will do her good,” he said smiling. “Sometimes I think
she’s like the giant Antaeus who became stronger each time he touched
Mother Earth. It doesn’t do for Scarlett to stay away too long from the
patch of red mud she loves. The sight of cotton growing will do her more
good than all Dr. Meade’s tonics.”</p>
<p>“Won’t you sit down?” said Melanie, her hands fluttering. He was so
very large and male, and excessively male creatures always discomposed
her. They seem to radiate a force and vitality that made her feel
smaller and weaker even than she was. He looked so swarthy and
formidable and the heavy muscles in his shoulders swelled against his
white linen coat in a way that frightened her. It seemed impossible that
she had seen all this strength and insolence brought low. And she had
held that black head in her lap!</p>
<p>“Oh, dear!” she thought in distress and blushed again.</p>
<p>“Miss Melly,” he said gently, “does my presence annoy you? Would you
rather I went away? Pray be frank.”</p>
<p>“Oh!” she thought. “He does remember! And he knows how upset I
am!”</p>
<p>She looked up at him, imploringly, and suddenly her embarrassment and
confusion faded. His eyes were so quiet, so kind, so understanding that
she wondered how she could ever have been silly enough to be flurried.
His face looked tired and, she thought with surprise, more than a little
sad. How could she have even thought he’d be ill bred enough to bring up
subjects both would rather forget?</p>
<p>“Poor thing, he’s been so worried about Scarlett,” she thought, and
managing a smile, she said: “Do sit down, Captain Butler.”</p>
<p>He sat down heavily and watched her as she picked up her darning.</p>
<p>“Miss Melly, I’ve come to ask a very great favor of you and,” he
smiled and his mouth twisted down, “to enlist your aid in a deception
from which I know you will shrink.”</p>
<p>“A — deception?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Really, I’ve come to talk business to you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, dear. Then it’s Mr. Wilkes you’d better see. I’m such a goose
about business. I’m not smart like Scarlett.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid Scarlett is too smart for her own good,” he said, “and
that is exactly what I want to talk to you about. You know how — ill
she’s been. When she gets back from Tara she will start again hammer and
tongs with the store and those mills which I wish devoutly would explode
some night. I fear for her health, Miss Melly.”</p>
<p>“Yes, she does far too much. You must make her stop and take care of
herself.”</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>“You know how headstrong she is. I never even try to argue with her.
She’s just like a willful child. She won’t let me help her — she won’t
let anyone help her. I’ve tried to get her to sell her share in the
mills but she won’t. And now, Miss Melly, I come to the business matter.
I know Scarlett would sell the remainder of her interest in the mills to
Mr. Wilkes but to no one else, and I want Mr. Wilkes to buy her
out.”</p>
<p>“Oh, dear me! That would be nice but —” Melanie stopped and bit her
lip. She could not mention money matters to an outsider. Somehow,
despite what he made from the mill, she and Ashley never seemed to have
enough money. It worried her that they saved so little. She did not know
where the money went. Ashley gave her enough to run the house on, but
when it came to extra expenses they were often pinched. Of course, her
doctors bills were so much, and then the books and furniture Ashley
ordered from New York did run into money. And they had fed and clothed
any number of waifs who slept in their cellar. And Ashley never felt
like refusing a loan to any man who’d been in the Confederate Army. And
—</p>
<p>“Miss Melly, I want to lend you the money,” said Rhett</p>
<p>“That’s so kind of you, but we might never repay it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want it repaid. Don’t be angry with me, Miss Melly! Please
hear me through. It will repay me enough to know that Scarlett will not
be exhausting herself driving miles to the mills every day. The store
will be enough to keep her busy and happy. … Don’t you see?”</p>
<p>“Well — yes —” said Melanie uncertainly.</p>
<p>“You want your boy to have a pony don’t you? And want him to go to
the university and to Harvard and to Europe on a Grand Tour?”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course,” cried Melanie, her face lighting up, as always, at
the mention of Beau. “I want him to have everything but — well, everyone
is so poor these days that —”</p>
<p>“Mr. Wilkes could make a pile of money out of the mills some day,”
said Rhett. “And I’d like to see Beau have all the advantages he
deserves.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Butler, what a crafty wretch you are!” she cried,
smiling. “Appealing to a mother’s pride! I can read you like a
book.”</p>
<p>“I hope not,” said Rhett, and for the first time there was a gleam in
his eye. “Now will you let me lend you the money?”</p>
<p>“But where does the deception come in?”</p>
<p>“We must be conspirators and deceive both Scarlett and
Mr. Wilkes.”</p>
<p>“Oh, dear! I couldn’t!”</p>
<p>“If Scarlett knew I had plotted behind her back, even for her own
good — well, you know her temper! And I’m afraid Mr. Wilkes would refuse
any loan I offered him. So neither of them must know where the money
comes from.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but I’m sure Mr. Wilkes wouldn’t refuse, if he understood the
matter. He is so fond of Scarlett.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m sure he is,” said Rhett smoothly. “But just the same he
would refuse. You know how proud all the Wilkes are.”</p>
<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Melanie miserably, “I wish — Really, Captain
Butler, I couldn’t deceive my husband.” -</p>
<p>“Not even to help Scarlett?” Rhett looked very hurt. “And she is so
fond of you!”</p>
<p>Tears trembled on Melanie’s eyelids.</p>
<p>“You know I’d do anything in the world for her. I can never, never
half repay her for what she’s done for me. You know.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said shortly, “I know what she’s done for you. Couldn’t you
tell Mr. Wilkes that the money was left you in the will of some
relative?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Butler, I haven’t a relative with a penny to bless
him!”</p>
<p>“Then, if I sent the money through the mail to Mr. Wilkes without his
knowing who sent it, would you see that it was used to buy the mills and
not — well, given away to destitute ex-Confederates?”</p>
<p>At first she looked hurt at his last words, as though they implied
criticism of Ashley, but he smiled so understandingly she smiled
back.</p>
<p>“Of course I will.”</p>
<p>“So it’s settled? It’s to be our secret?”</p>
<p>“But I have never kept anything secret from my husband!”</p>
<p>“I’m sure of that, Miss Melly.”</p>
<p>As she looked at him she thought how right she had always been about
him and how wrong so many other people were. People had said he was
brutal and sneering and bad mannered and even dishonest Though many of
the nicest people were now admitting they had been wrong. Well! She had
known from the very beginning that he was a fine man. She had never
received from him anything but the kindest treatment, thoughtfulness,
utter respect and what understanding! And then, how he loved Scarlett!
How sweet of him to take this roundabout way of sparing Scarlett one of
the loads she carried!</p>
<p>In an impulsive rush of feeling, she said: “Scarlett’s lucky to have
a husband who’s so nice to her!”</p>
<p>“You think so? I’m afraid she wouldn’t agree with you, if she could
hear you. Besides, I want to be nice to you too, Miss Melly. I’m giving
you more than I’m giving Scarlett.”</p>
<p>“Me!” she questioned, puzzled. “Oh, you mean for Beau.”</p>
<p>He picked up his hat and rose. He stood for a moment looking down at
the plain, heart-shaped face with its long widow’s peak and serious dark
eyes. Such an unworldly face, a face with no defenses against life.</p>
<p>“No, not Beau. I’m trying to give you something more than Beau, if
you can imagine that”</p>
<p>“No, I can’t,” she said, bewildered again. “There’s nothing in the
world more precious to me than Beau except Ash — except Mr. Wilkes.”</p>
<p>Rhett said nothing and looked down at her, his dark face still.</p>
<p>“You’re mighty nice to want to do things for me, Captain Butler, but
really, I’m so lucky. I have everything in the world any woman could
want.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine,” said Rhett, suddenly grim. “And I intend to see that
you keep them.”</p>
<p>When Scarlett came back from Tara, the unhealthy pallor had gone from
her face and her cheeks were rounded and faintly pink. Her green eyes
were alert and sparkling again, and she laughed aloud for the first time
in weeks when Rhett and Bonnie met her and Wade and Ella at the depot —
laughed in annoyance and amusement. Rhett had two straggling turkey
feathers in the brim of his hat and Bonnie, dressed in a sadly torn
dress that was her Sunday frock, had diagonal lines of indigo blue on
her cheeks and a peacock feather half as long as she was in her curls.
Evidently a game of Indian had been in progress when the time came to
meet the train and it was obvious from the look of quizzical
helplessness on Rhett’s face and the lowering indignation of Mammy that
Bonnie had refused to have her toilet remedied, even to meet her
mother.</p>
<p>Scarlett said: “What a ragamuffin!” as she kissed the child and
turned a cheek for Rhett’s lips. There were crowds of people in the
depot or she would never have invited this caress. She could not help
noticing, for all her embarrassment at Bonnie’s appearance, that
everyone in the crowd was smiling at the figure father and daughter cut,
smiling not in derision but in genuine amusement and kindness. Everyone
knew that Scarlett’s youngest had her father under her thumb and Atlanta
was amused and approving. Rhett’s great love for his child had gone far
toward reinstating him in public opinion.</p>
<p>On the way home, Scarlett was full of County news. The hot, dry
weather was making the cotton grow so fast you could almost hear it but
Will said cotton prices were going to be low this fall. Suellen was
going to have another baby — she spelled this out so the children would
not comprehend — and Ella had shown unwonted spirit in biting Suellen’s
oldest girl. Though, observed Scarlett, it was no more than little Susie
deserved, she being her mother all over again. But Suellen had become
infuriated and they had had an invigorating quarrel that was just like
old times. Wade had killed a water moccasin, all by himself. ’Randa and
Camilla Tarleton were teaching school and wasn’t that a joke? Not a one
of the Tarletons had ever been able to spell cat! Betsy Tarleton had
married a fat one-armed man from Lovejoy and they and Hetty and Jim
Tarleton were raising a good cotton crop at Fairhill. Mrs. Tarleton had
a brood mare and a colt and was as happy as though she had a million
dollars. And there were negroes living in the old Calvert house! Swarms
of them and they actually owned it! They’d bought it in at the sheriff’s
sale. The place was dilapidated and it made you cry to look at it. No
one knew where Cathleen and her no-good husband had gone. And Alex was
to marry Sally, his brother’s widow! Imagine that, after them living in
the same house for so many years! Everybody said it was a marriage of
convenience because people were beginning to gossip about them living
there alone, since both Old Miss and Young Miss had died. And it had
about broken Dimity Munroe’s heart. But it served her right If she’d had
any gumption she’d have caught her another man long ago, instead of
waiting for Alex to get money enough to marry her.</p>
<p>Scarlett chattered on cheerfully but there were many things about the
County which she suppressed, things that hurt to think about. She had
driven over the County with Will, trying not to remember when these
thousands of fertile acres had stood green with cotton. Now, plantation
after plantation was going back to the forest and dismal fields of
broomsedge, scrub oak and runty pines had grown stealthily about silent
ruins and over old cotton fields. Only one acre was being farmed now
where once a hundred had been under the plow. It was like moving through
a dead land.</p>
<p>“This section won’t come back for fifty years — if it ever comes
back,” Will had said. Tara’s the best farm in the County, thanks to you
and me, Scarlett, but it’s a farm, a two-mule farm, not a plantation.
And the Fontaine place, it comes next to Tare and then the Tarletons.
They ain’t makin’ much money but they’re getting’ along and they got
gumption. But most of the rest of the folks, the rest of the farms —
”</p>
<p>No, Scarlett did not like to remember the way the deserted County
looked. It seemed even sadder, in retrospect beside the bustle and
prosperity of Atlanta.</p>
<p>“Has anything happened here?” she asked when they were finally home
and were seated on the front porch. She had talked rapidly and
continuously all the way home, fearing that a silence would fall. She
had not had a word alone with Rhett since that day when she fell down
the steps and she was none too anxious to be alone with him now. She did
not know how he felt toward her. He had been kindness itself during her
miserable convalescence, but it was the kindness of an impersonal
stranger. He had anticipated her wants, kept the children from bothering
her and supervised the store and the mills. But he had never said: “I’m
sorry.” Well, perhaps he wasn’t sorry. Perhaps he still thought that
child that was never born was not his child. How could she tell what
went on in the mind behind the bland dark face? But he had showed a
disposition to be courteous, for the first time in their married life,
and a desire to let life go on as though there had never been anything
unpleasant between them — as though, thought Scarlett cheerlessly, as
though there had never been anything at all between them. Well, if that
was what he wanted, she could act her part too.</p>
<p>“Is everything all right?” she repeated. “Did you get the new
shingles for the store? Did you swap the mules? For Heaven’s sake,
Rhett, take those feathers out of your hat. You look a fool and you’ll
be likely to wear them downtown without remembering to take them
out.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Bonnie, picking up her father’s hat defensively.</p>
<p>“Everything has gone very well here,” replied Rhett. “Bonnie and I
have had a nice time and I don’t believe her hair has been combed since
you left. Don’t suck the feathers, darling, they may be nasty. Yes, the
shingles are fixed and I got a good trade on the mules. No, there’s
really no news. Everything has been quite dull.”</p>
<p>Then, as an afterthought he added: “The honorable Ashley was over
here last night. He wanted to know if I thought you would sell him your
mill and the part interest you have in his.”</p>
<p>Scarlett who had been rocking and fanning herself with a turkey tail
fan, stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>“Sell? Where on earth did Ashley get the money? You know they never
have a cent. Melanie spends it as fast as he makes it.”</p>
<p>Rhett shrugged. “I always thought her a frugal little person, but
then I’m not as well informed about the intimate details of the Wilkes
family as you seem to be.”</p>
<p>That jab seemed in something of Rhett’s old style and Scarlett grew
annoyed.</p>
<p>“Run away, dear,” she said to Bonnie. “Mother wants to talk to
Father.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Bonnie positively and climbed upon Rhett’s lap.</p>
<p>Scarlett frowned at her child and Bonnie scowled back in so complete
a resemblance to Gerald O’Hara that Scarlett almost laughed.</p>
<p>“Let her stay,” said Rhett comfortably. “As to where he got the
money, it seems it was sent him by someone he nursed through a case of
smallpox at Rock Island. It renews my faith in human nature to know that
gratitude still exists.”</p>
<p>“Who was it? Anyone we know?”</p>
<p>“The letter was unsigned and came from Washington. Ashley was at a
loss to know who could have sent it. But then, one of Ashley’s unselfish
temperament goes about the world doing so many good deeds that you can’t
expect him to remember all of them.”</p>
<p>Had she not been so surprised at Ashley’s windfall, Scarlett would
have taken up this gauntlet, although while at Tara she had decided that
never again would she permit herself to be involved in any quarrel with
Rhett about Ashley. The ground on which she stood in this matter was
entirely too uncertain and, until she knew exactly where she stood with
both men, she did not care to be drawn out.</p>
<p>“He wants to buy me out?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But Of course, I told him you wouldn’t sell.”</p>
<p>“I wish you’d let me mind my own business.”</p>
<p>“Well, you know you wouldn’t part with the mills. I told him that he
knew as well as I did that you couldn’t bear not to have your finger in
everybody’s pie, and if you sold out to him, then you wouldn’t be able
to tell him how to mind his own business.”</p>
<p>“You dared say that to him about me?”</p>
<p>“Why not? It’s true, isn’t it? I believe he heartily agreed with me
but of course, he was too much of a gentleman to come right out and say
so.”</p>
<p>“It’s a lie! I will sell them to him!” cried Scarlett angrily.</p>
<p>Until that moment, she had had no idea of parting with the mills. She
had several reasons for wanting to keep them and their monetary value
was the least reason. She could have sold them for large sums any time
in the last few years, but she had refused all offers. The mills were
the tangible evidence of what she had done, unaided and against great
odds, and she was proud of them and of herself. Most of all, she did not
want to sell them because they were the only path that lay open to
Ashley. If the mills went from her control it would mean that she would
seldom see Ashley and probably never see him alone. And she had to see
him alone. She could not go on this way any longer, wondering what his
feelings toward her were now, wondering if all his love had died in
shame since the dreadful night of Melanie’s party. In the course of
business she could find many opportune times for conversations without
it appearing to anyone that she was seeking him out. And, given time,
she knew she could gain back whatever ground she had lost in his heart.
But if she sold the mills —</p>
<p>No, she did not want to sell but, goaded by the thought that Rhett
had exposed her to Ashley in so truthful and so unflattering a light,
she had made up her mind instantly. Ashley should have the mills and at
a price so low he could not help realizing how generous she was.</p>
<p>“I will sell!” she cried furiously. “Now, what do you think of
that?”</p>
<p>There was the faintest gleam of triumph in Rhett’s eyes as he bent to
tie Bonnie’s shoe string.</p>
<p>“I think you’ll regret it,” he said.</p>
<p>Already she was regretting the hasty words. Had they been spoken to
anyone save Rhett she would have shamelessly retracted them. Why had she
burst out like that? She looked at Rhett with an angry frown and saw
that he was watching her with his old keen, cat-at-a-mouse-hole look.
When he saw her frown, he laughed suddenly, his white teeth flashing.
Scarlett had an uncertain feeling that he had jockeyed her into this
position.</p>
<p>“Did you have anything to do with this?” she snapped.</p>
<p>“I?” His brows went up in mock surprise. “You should know me better.
I never go about the world doing good deeds if I can avoid it.”</p>
<p>That night she sold the mills and all her interest in them to Ashley.
She did not lose thereby for Ashley refused to take advantage of her
first low offer and met the highest bid that she had ever had for them.
When she had signed the papers and the mills were irrevocably gone and
Melanie was passing small glasses of wine to Ashley and Rhett to
celebrate the transaction, Scarlett felt bereft as though she had sold
one of her children.</p>
<p>The mills had been her darlings, her pride, the fruit of her small
grasping hands. She had started with one little mill in those black days
when Atlanta was barely struggling up from ruin and ashes and want was
staring her in the face. She had fought and schemed and nursed them
through the dark times when Yankee confiscation loomed, when money was
tight and smart men going to the wall. And now when Atlanta was covering
its scars and buildings were going up everywhere and newcomers flocking
to the town every day, she had two fine mills, two lumber yards, a dozen
mule teams and convict labor to operate the business at low cost Bidding
farewell to them was like closing a door forever on a part of her life,
a bitter, harsh part but one which she recalled with a nostalgic
satisfaction.</p>
<p>She had built up this business and now she had sold it and she was
oppressed with the certainty that, without her at the helm, Ashley would
lose it all — everything that she had worked to build. Ashley trusted
everyone and still hardly knew a two-by-four from a six-by-eight. And
now she would never be able to give him the benefit of her advice — all
because Rhett had told him that she liked to boss everything.</p>
<p>“Oh, damn Rhett!” she thought and as she watched him the conviction
grew that he was at the bottom of all this. Just how and why she did not
know. He was talking to Ashley and his words brought her up sharply.</p>
<p>“I suppose you’ll turn the convicts back right away,” he said.</p>
<p>Turn the convicts back? Why should there be any idea of turning them
back? Rhett knew perfectly well that the large profits from the mills
grew out of the cheap convict labor. And why did Rhett speak with such
certainty about what Ashley’s future actions would be? What did he know
of him?</p>
<p>“Yes, they’ll go back immediately,” replied Ashley and he avoided
Scarlett’s dumbfounded gaze.</p>
<p>“Have you lost your mind?” she cried. “You’ll lose all the money on
the lease and what kind of labor can you get, anyway?”</p>
<p>“I’ll use free darkies,” said Ashley.</p>
<p>“Free darkies! Fiddle-dee-dee! You know what their wages will cost
and besides you’ll have the Yankees on your neck every minute to see if
you’re giving them chicken three times a day and tucking them to sleep
under eiderdown quilts. And if you give a lazy darky a couple of licks
to speed him up, you’ll hear the Yankees scream from here to Dalton and
you’ll end up in jail. Why, convicts are the only —”</p>
<p>Melanie looked down into her lap at her twisted hands. Ashley looked
unhappy but obdurate. For a moment he was silent Then his gaze crossed
Rhett’s and it was as if he found understanding and encouragement in
Rhett’s eyes — a glance that was not lost on Scarlett.</p>
<p>“I won’t work convicts, Scarlett,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>“Well, sir!” her breath was taken away. “And why not? Are you afraid
people will talk about you like they do about me?”</p>
<p>Ashley raised his head.</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid of what people say as long as I’m right. And I have
never felt that convict labor was right.”</p>
<p>“But why —”</p>
<p>“I can’t make money from the enforced labor and misery of
others.”</p>
<p>“But you owned slaves!”</p>
<p>“They weren’t miserable. And besides, I’d have freed them all when
Father died if the war hadn’t already freed them. But this is different,
Scarlett. The system is open to too many abuses. Perhaps you don’t know
it but I do. I know very well that Johnnie Gallegher has killed at least
one man at his camp. Maybe more — who cares about one convict, more or
less? He said the man was killed trying to escape, but that’s not what
I’ve heard elsewhere. And I know he works men who are too sick to work.
Call it superstition, but I do not believe that happiness can come from
money made from the sufferings of others.”</p>
<p>“God’s nightgown! You mean — goodness, Ashley, you didn’t swallow all
the Reverend Wallace’s bellowings about tainted money?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t have to swallow it I believed it long before he preached on
it.”</p>
<p>“Then, you must think all my money is tainted,” cried Scarlett
beginning to be angry. “Because I worked convicts and own saloon
property and —” She stopped short. Both the Wilkes looked embarrassed
and Rhett was grinning broadly. Damn him, thought Scarlett, vehemently.
He’s thinking that I’m sticking my finger in other people’s pies again
and so is Ashley. I’d like to crack their heads together! She swallowed
her wrath and tried to assume an aloof air of dignity but with little
success.</p>
<p>“Of course, it’s immaterial to me,” she said.</p>
<p>“Scarlett, don’t think I’m criticizing you! I’m not. It’s just that
we look at things in different ways and what is good for you might not
be good for me.”</p>
<p>She suddenly wished that they were alone, wished ardently that Rhett
and Melanie were at the end of the earth, so she could cry out: “But I
want to look at things the way you look at them! Tell me just what you
mean, so I can understand and be like you!”</p>
<p>But with Melanie present, trembling with the distress of the scene,
and Rhett lounging, grinning at her, she could only say with as much
coolness and offended virtue as she could muster: “I’m sure it’s your
own business, Ashley, and far be it from me to tell you how to run it.
But, I must say, I do not understand your attitude or your remarks.”</p>
<p>Oh, if they were only alone, so she would not be forced to say these
cool things to him, these words that were making him unhappy!</p>
<p>“I’ve offended you, Scarlett, and I did not mean to. You must believe
me and forgive me. There is nothing enigmatic in what I said. It is only
that I believe that money which comes in certain ways seldom brings
happiness.”</p>
<p>“But you’re wrong!” she cried, unable to restrain herself any longer.
“Look at me! You know how my money came. You know how things were before
I made my money! You remember that winter at Tara when it was so cold
and we were cutting up the carpets for shoes and there wasn’t enough to
eat and we used to wonder how we were going to give Beau and Wade an
education. You remem —”</p>
<p>“I remember,” said Ashley tiredly, “but I’d rather forget.”</p>
<p>“Well, you can’t say any of us were happy then, can you? And look at
us now! You’ve a nice home and a good future. And has anyone a prettier
house than mine or nicer clothes or finer horses? Nobody sets as fine a
table as me or gives nicer receptions and my children have everything
they want. Well, how did I get the money to make it possible? Off trees?
No, sir! Convicts and saloon rentals and —”</p>
<p>“And don’t forget murdering that Yankee,” said Rhett softly. “He
really gave you your start.”</p>
<p>Scarlett swung on him, furious words on her lips.</p>
<p>“And the money has made you very, very happy, hasn’t it, darling?” he
asked, poisonously sweet.</p>
<p>Scarlett stopped short, her mouth open, and her eyes went swiftly to
the eyes of the other three. Melanie was almost crying with
embarrassment, Ashley was suddenly bleak and withdrawn and Rhett was
watching her over his cigar with impersonal amusement. She started to
cry out: “But of course, it’s made me happy!”</p>
<p>But somehow, she could not speak.</p>
