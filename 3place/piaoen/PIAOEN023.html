<h4 id="chapter-xxii">CHAPTER XXII</h4>
<p>THERE WOULD NEVER AGAIN BE an afternoon as long as this one. Or as
hot. Or as full of lazy insolent flies. They swarmed on Melanie despite
the fan Scarlett kept in constant motion. Her arms ached from swinging
the wide palmetto leaf. All her efforts seemed futile, for while she
brushed them from Melanie’s moist face, they crawled on her clammy feet
and legs and made her jerk them weakly and cry: “Please! On my
feet!”</p>
<p>The room was in semigloom, for Scarlett had pulled down the shades to
shut out the heat and brightness. Pin points of sunlight came in through
minute holes in the shades and about the edges. The room was an oven and
Scarlett’s sweat-drenched clothes never dried but became wetter and
stickier as the hours went by. Prissy was crouched in a corner, sweating
too, and smelled so abominably Scarlett would have sent her from the
room had she not feared the girl would take to her heels if once out of
sight Melanie lay on the bed on a sheet dark with perspiration and
splotched with dampness where Scarlett had spilled water. She twisted
endlessly, to one side, to the other, to left, to right and back
again.</p>
<p>Sometimes she tried to sit up and fell back and began twisting again.
At first, she had tried to keep from crying out, biting her lips until
they were raw, and Scarlett, whose nerves were as raw as the lips, said
huskily: “Melly, for God’s sake, don’t try to be brave. Yell if you want
to. There’s nobody to hear you but us.”</p>
<p>As the afternoon wore on, Melanie moaned whether she wanted to be
brave or not, and sometimes she screamed. When she did, Scarlett dropped
her head into her hands and covered her ears and twisted her body and
wished that she herself were dead. Anything was preferable to being a
helpless witness to such pain. Anything was better than being tied here
waiting for a baby that took such a long time coming. Waiting, when for
all she knew the Yankees were actually at Five Points.</p>
<p>She fervently wished she had paid more attention to the whispered
conversations of matrons on the subject of childbirth. If only she had!
If only she had been more interested in such matters she’d know whether
Melanie was taking a long time or not. She had a vague memory of one of
Aunt Pitty’s stories of a friend who was in labor for two days and died
without ever having the baby. Suppose Melanie should go on like this for
two days! But Melanie was so delicate. She couldn’t stand two days of
this pain. She’d die soon if the baby didn’t hurry. And how could she
ever face Ashley, if he were still alive, and tell him that Melanie had
died — after she had promised to take care of her?</p>
<p>At first, Melanie wanted to hold Scarlett’s hand when the pain was
bad but she clamped down on it so hard she nearly broke the bones. After
an hour of this, Scarlett’s hands were so swollen and bruised she could
hardly flex them. She knotted two long towels together and tied them to
the foot of the bed and put the knotted end in Melanie’s hands. Melanie
hung onto it as though it were a life line, straining, pulling it taut,
slackening it, tearing it. Throughout the afternoon, her voice went on
like an animal dying in a trap. Occasionally she dropped the towel and
rubbed her hands feebly and looked up at Scarlett with eyes enormous
with pain.</p>
<p>“Talk to me. Please talk to me,” she whispered and Scarlett would
gabble something until Melanie again gripped the knot and again began
writhing.</p>
<p>The dim room swam with heat and pain and droning flies, and time went
by on such dragging feet Scarlett could scarcely remember the morning.
She felt as if she had been in this steaming, dark, sweating place all
her life. She wanted very much to scream every time Melanie did, and
only by biting her lips so hard it infuriated her could she restrain
herself and drive off hysteria.</p>
<p>Once Wade came tiptoeing up the stairs and stood outside the door,
wailing.</p>
<p>“Wade hungwy!” Scarlett started to go to him, but Melanie whispered:
“Don’t leave me. Please. I can stand it when you’re here.”</p>
<p>So Scarlett sent Prissy down to warm up the breakfast hominy and feed
him. For herself, she felt that she could never eat again after this
afternoon.</p>
<p>The clock on the mantel had stopped and she had no way of telling the
time but as the heat in the room lessened and the bright pin points of
light grew duller, she pulled the shade aside. She saw to her surprise
that it was late afternoon and the sun, a ball of crimson, was far down
the sky. Somehow, she had imagined it would remain broiling hot noon
forever.</p>
<p>She wondered passionately what was going on downtown. Had all the
troops moved out yet? Had the Yankees come? Would the Confederates march
away without even a fight? Then she remembered with a sick dropping in
her stomach how few Confederates there were and how many men Sherman had
and how well fed they were. Sherman! The name of Satan himself did not
frightened her half so much. But there was no time for thinking now, as
Melanie called for water, for a cold towel on her head, to be fanned, to
have the flies brushed away from her face.</p>
<p>When twilight came on and Prissy, scurrying like a black wraith, lit
a lamp, Melanie became weaker. She began calling for Ashley, over and
over, as if in a delirium until the hideous monotony gave Scarlett a
fierce desire to smother her voice with a pillow. Perhaps the doctor
would come after all. If he would only come quickly! Hope raising its
head, she turned to Prissy, and ordered her to run quickly to the
Meades’ house and see if he were there or Mrs. Meade.</p>
<p>“And if he’s not there, ask Mrs. Meade or Cookie what to do. Beg them
to come!”</p>
<p>Prissy was off with a clatter and Scarlett watched her hurrying down
the street, going faster than she had ever dreamed the worthless child
could move. After a prolonged time she was back, alone.</p>
<p>“De doctah ain’ been home all day. Sont wud he mout go off wid de
sojers. Miss Scarlett, Mist’ Phil’s ’ceased.”</p>
<p>“Dead?”</p>
<p>“Yas’m,” said Prissy, expanding with importance. Talbot, dey
coachman, tole me. He wuz shot —”</p>
<p>“Never mind that.”</p>
<p>“Ah din’ see Miss Meade. Cookie say Miss Meade she washin’ him an’
fixin ter buhy him fo’ de Yankees gits hyah. Cookie say effen de pain
get too bad, jes’ you put a knife unner Miss Melly’s bed an’ it cut de
pain in two.”</p>
<p>Scarlett wanted to slap her again for this helpful information but
Melanie opened wide, dilated eyes and whispered: “Dear — are the Yankees
coming?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Scarlett stoutly. “Prissy’s a liar.”</p>
<p>“Yas’m, Ah sho is,” Prissy agreed fervently.</p>
<p>“They’re coming,” whispered Melanie undeceived and buried her face in
the pillow. Her voice came out muffled.</p>
<p>“My poor baby. My poor baby.” And, after a long interval: “Oh,
Scarlett, you mustn’t stay here. You must go and take Wade.”</p>
<p>What Melanie said was no more than Scarlett had been thinking but
hearing it put into words infuriated her, shamed her as if her secret
cowardice was written plainly in her face.</p>
<p>“Don’t be a goose. I’m not afraid. You know I won’t leave you.”</p>
<p>“You might as well. I’m going to die.” And she began moaning
again.</p>
<p>Scarlett came down the dark stairs slowly, like an old woman, feeling
her way, clinging to the banisters lest she fall. Her legs were leaden,
trembling with fatigue and strain, and she shivered with cold from the
clammy sweat that soaked her body. Feebly she made her way onto the
front porch and sank down on the top step. She sprawled back against a
pillar of the porch and with a shaking hand unbuttoned her basque
halfway down her bosom. The night was drenched in warm soft darkness and
she lay staring into it, dull as an ox.</p>
<p>It was all over. Melanie was not dead and the small baby boy who made
noises like a young kitten was receiving his first bath at Prissy’s
hands. Melanie was asleep. How could she sleep after that nightmare of
screaming pain and ignorant midwifery that hurt more than it helped? Why
wasn’t she dead? Scarlett knew that she herself would have died under
such handling. But when it was over, Melanie had even whispered, so
weakly she had to bend over her to hear: “Thank you.” And then she had
gone to sleep. How could she go to sleep? Scarlett forgot that she too
had gone to sleep after Wade was born. She forgot everything. Her mind
was a vacuum; the world was a vacuum; there had been no life before this
endless day and there would be none hereafter — only a heavily hot
night, only the sound of her hoarse tired breathing, only the sweat
trickling coldly from armpit to waist, from hip to knee, clammy, sticky,
chilling.</p>
<p>She heard her own breath pass from loud evenness to spasmodic sobbing
but her eyes were dry and burning as though there would never be tears
in them again. Slowly, laboriously, she heaved herself over and pulled
her heavy skirts up to her thighs. She was warm and cold and sticky all
at the same time and the feel of the night air on her limbs was
refreshing. She thought dully what Aunt Pitty would say, if she could
see her sprawled here on the front porch with her skirts up and her
drawers showing, but she did not care. She did not care about anything.
Time had stood still. It might be just after twilight and it might be
midnight. She didn’t know or care.</p>
<p>She heard sounds of moving feet upstairs and thought “May the Lord
damn Prissy,” before her eyes closed and something like sleep descended
upon her. Then after an indeterminate dark interval, Prissy was beside
her, chattering on in a pleased way.</p>
<p>“We done right good, Miss Scarlett. Ah specs Maw couldn’ a did no
better.”</p>
<p>From the shadows, Scarlett glared at her, too tired to rail, too
tired to upbraid, too tired to enumerate Prissy’s offenses—her boastful
assumption of experience she didn’t possess, her fright, her blundering
awkwardness, her utter inefficiency when the emergency was hot, the
misplacing of the scissors, the spilling of the basin of water on the
bed, the dropping of the new born baby. And now she bragged about how
good she had been.</p>
<p>And the Yankees wanted to free the negroes! Well, the Yankees were
welcome to them.</p>
<p>She lay back against the pillar in silence and Prissy, aware of her
mood, tiptoed away into the darkness of the porch. After a long interval
in which her breathing finally quieted and her mind steadied, Scarlett
heard the sound of faint voices from up the road, the tramping of many
feet coming from the north. Soldiers! She sat up slowly, pulling down
her skirts, although she knew no one could see her in the darkness. As
they came abreast the house, an indeterminate number, passing like
shadows, she called to them.</p>
<p>“Oh, please!”</p>
<p>A shadow disengaged itself from the mass and came to the gate.</p>
<p>“Are you going? Are you leaving us?”</p>
<p>The shadow seemed to take off a hat and a quiet voice came from the
darkness.</p>
<p>“Yes, Ma’m. That’s what we’re doing. We’re the last of the men from
the breastworks, ’bout a mile north from here.”</p>
<p>“Are you — is the army really retreating?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Ma’m. You see, the Yankees are coming.”</p>
<p>The Yankees are coming! She had forgotten that. Her throat suddenly
contracted and she could say nothing more. The shadow moved away, merged
itself with the other shadows and the feet tramped off into the
darkness. “The Yankees are coming! The Yankees are coming!” That was
what the rhythm of their feet said, that was what her suddenly bumping
heart thudded out with each beat The Yankees are coming!</p>
<p>“De Yankees is comin’!” bawled Prissy, shrinking close to her. “Oh,
Miss Scarlett, dey’ll kill us all! Dey’ll run dey baynits in our
stummicks! Dey’ll —”</p>
<p>“Oh, hush!” It was terrifying enough to think these things without
hearing them put into trembling words. Renewed fear swept her. What
could she do? How could she escape? Where could she turn for help? Every
friend had failed her.</p>
<p>Suddenly she thought of Rhett Butler and calm dispelled her fears.
Why hadn’t she thought of him this morning when she had been tearing
about like a chicken with its head off? She hated him, but he was strong
and smart and he wasn’t afraid of the Yankees. And he was still in town.
Of course, she was mad at him. But she could overlook such things at a
time like this. And he had a horse and carriage, too. Oh, why hadn’t she
thought of him before! He could take them all away from this doomed
place, away from the Yankees, somewhere, anywhere.</p>
<p>She turned to Prissy and spoke with feverish urgency.</p>
<p>“You know where Captain Butler lives — at the Atlanta Hotel?”</p>
<p>“Yas’m, but —”</p>
<p>“Well, go there, now, as quick as you can run and tell him I want
him. I want him to come quickly and bring his horse and carriage or an
ambulance if he can get one. Tell him about the baby. Tell him I want
him to take us out of here. Go, now. Hurry!”</p>
<p>She sat upright and gave Prissy a push to speed her feet.</p>
<p>“Gawdlmighty, Miss Scarlett! Ah’s sceered ter go runnin’ roun’ in de
dahk by mahseff! Spose de Yankees gits me?”</p>
<p>“If you run fast you can catch up with those soldiers and they won’t
let the Yankees get you. Hurry!”</p>
<p>“Ah’s sceered! Sposin’ Cap’n Butler ain’ at de hotel?”</p>
<p>“Then ask where he is. Haven’t you any gumption? If he isn’t at the
hotel, go to the barrooms on Decatur Street and ask for him. Go to Belle
Watling’s house. Hunt for him. You fool, don’t you see that if you don’t
hurry and find him the Yankees will surely get us all?”</p>
<p>“Miss Scarlett, Maw would weah me out wid a cotton stalk, did Ah go
in a bahroom or a ho’ house.”</p>
<p>Scarlett pulled herself to her feet.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll wear you out if you don’t. You can stand outside in the
street and yell for him, can’t you? Or ask somebody if he’s inside. Get
going.”</p>
<p>When Prissy still lingered, shuffling her feet and mouthing, Scarlett
gave her another push which nearly sent her headlong down the front
steps.</p>
<p>“You’ll go or I’ll sell you down the river. You’ll never see your
mother again or anybody you know and I’ll sell you for a field hand too.
Hurry!”</p>
<p>“Gawdlmighty, Miss Scarlett —”</p>
<p>But under the determined pressure of her mistress’ hand she started
down the steps. The front gate clicked and Scarlett cried: “Run, you
goose!”</p>
<p>She heard the patter of Prissy’s feet as she broke into a trot, and
then the sound died away on the soft earth.</p>
