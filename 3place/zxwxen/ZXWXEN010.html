<h4 id="the-dragons-hoard">8 The Dragon’s Hoard</h4>
<p>One of the first things I noticed about Sam Bankman-Fried was how
easy he was to steal from. On that early morning in late April of 2022,
just about anyone could have walked right into his jungle hut and taken
whomever or whatever they wanted. The guard booth fronting FTX’s
temporary global headquarters was unmanned. The parking lot barrier gate
extended less than halfway across the entrance road and so was more an
idea of an obstacle than an actual one. The door to jungle hut number
27, where Sam worked, was unlocked, and the receptionist’s desk was
vacant. I’d soon be asking Nishad Singh for the same premortem I’d ask
of others at the top of their psychiatrist’s org chart: “Imagine we’re
in the future and your company has collapsed: tell me how it happened.”
“Someone kidnaps Sam,” Nishad would reply immediately, before unspooling
his recurring nightmare of Sam’s lax attitude toward his personal safety
leading to the undoing of their empire. At that moment, it seemed
reasonable that he should worry more about this than about other risks.
Sam was a famous and easily trackable rich person who moved around
without bodyguards while in possession of billions of dollars’ worth of
various cryptocurrencies, which, while not all that useful as a means of
exchange, made for excellent ransom. “People with access to crypto are
prime kidnap targets,” said Nishad. “I cannot understand why it doesn’t
happen more.”</p>
<p>The only tricky part would have been figuring out which hut Sam was
in. FTX’s headquarters now consisted of a dozen or so identical small
single-story buildings painted tan, with dull metal roofs the color of
milk chocolate. Whoever had built them had started by giving up on the
idea of decoration, or charm of any sort. Nothing on the outside of any
of them indicated which might house the people worth kidnapping. Of
course at this hour, seven in the morning, that might not have mattered,
as there were so few people. There was a fair chance that Sam was the
only human being in any of the buildings, and so the hunter would only
need to go from hut to hut until he found his prey. Sam would be
helpless. He wasn’t built to escape, or even to notice, a physical
threat.</p>
<p>However, he wasn’t there when I arrived. Nishad was, though he barely
looked up when I sat down beside him at Sam’s desk. A small mountain of
objects that covered the desk spilled out onto the beanbag chair beside
it. While Nishad typed away, I picked through the items and made an
inventory:</p>
<p>One giant canister of Morton salt</p>
<p>One iPhone box with new phone still inside it</p>
<p>One crumpled one-dollar bill</p>
<p>Four fidget spinners</p>
<p>One deck of playing cards</p>
<p>One pillow and one blanket</p>
<p>Two large half-opened cardboard boxes filled with Miami Heat
jerseys</p>
<p>One box cutter</p>
<p>One open bottle of unscented mosquito repellent in a sealed plastic
bag</p>
<p>Four manila folders containing confidential corporate documents
requiring Sam’s signature</p>
<p>One LiftMaster automatic garage door opener</p>
<p>A second new iPhone box with phone inside</p>
<p>One ceremonial medal, presented to Sam Bankman-Fried by Francis
Suarez, mayor of the city of Miami</p>
<p>A dozen square plastic boxes of unclear purpose inscribed with the
message FTX: Welcome to your new world of payments</p>
<p>Three pairs of chopsticks</p>
<p>One key card to a Ritz-Carlton hotel room</p>
<p>One handheld Gaiatop fan</p>
<p>One abnormal Rubik’s Cube, with all squares painted white</p>
<p>I was about halfway through the pile when Sam appeared. I had the
briefest sensation of being discovered by a teenager while taking in the
chaos they’d made in their bedroom. If he was curious how I’d gotten
into his office, or why I was now picking through the contents of his
desk, he didn’t show it. Something new was up.</p>
<p>If there was any rule governing Sam’s life, it was that it was never
allowed to bore him. “He’s like Kanye,” said a Sam watcher who also
spent time with Kanye West. “Wherever he goes, all this wild shit just
happens.” That day—the morning I turned up at his desk and took an
inventory—wild shit was happening. Elon Musk was buying Twitter and Sam
had been on the phone with one of Musk’s advisors, Igor Kurganov.
Kurganov was a Russian-born former professional poker player to whom
Musk had entrusted the task, it was reported, of giving away more than
billion worth of his fortune. He was also a self-described effective
altruist, thickening the plot. He and Sam had just spoken of the
possibility that Sam might help to pay for the Twitter purchase. As it
turned out, Sam had already sunk 00 million into Twitter shares and
entertained a private fantasy of finding some way to buy the rest. Most
of them he’d bought at 3 a share, or 1.20 a share less than Musk had
just agreed to pay for the entire company.</p>
<p>When there was something new to buy, Sam often found it useful to
talk it over with Ramnik and Nishad. Both were smart, at least in the
high-IQ way that Sam understood. Both also had a curious ability to
disagree with Sam without making a big deal about it, or forcing him to
feel that he actually had to listen to whatever they said. After talking
to them, Sam could tell himself that he’d checked his judgment without
having done so. Now he grabbed them both and pulled them into what
passed in the jungle hut for a meeting room. It had a single chair and a
sofa, upon which Sam stretched, barefoot, a fidget spinner on his chest.
Ramnik and Nishad sat down on the floor, cross-legged. All three wore
short pants, and in the room, for a moment, it felt like nap time for a
small class of restless first graders. But then Sam explained what he
wanted to talk about: Elon Musk really was going to buy Twitter, but he
didn’t really want to pay for it himself. He was looking for allies to
pick up some of the 4 billion it was going to cost. They want us among
them. But we only have three hours to get back to them.</p>
<p>“What do you get out of this?” asked Nishad, reasonably.</p>
<p>“There’s some random shit,” said Sam, then made it clear that the
most important random shit was a new alliance with Elon Musk. Crypto
lived on Twitter, and Musk was Twitter’s loudest voice. With a single
tweet, Musk could trigger a stampede of crypto traders from Coinbase to
FTX, or the reverse. He also controlled the world’s biggest private
fortune and, by employing Igor Kurganov, was signaling a willingness to
direct some of it to EA causes.</p>
<p>“How much are we thinking?” asked Ramnik.</p>
<p>“Maybe a billion,” said Sam. An uneasy look crossed Ramnik’s face and
then vanished.</p>
<p>“But maybe as low as two hundred and fifty million,” said Sam. A
pittance. A mere extra 50 million on top of the 00 million worth of
Twitter stock they already owned, and which they could just roll into
the deal.</p>
<p>“Can we actually talk to Elon?’ asked Nishad. “Does it actually lead
to EA stuff?”</p>
<p>“He’s a weird dude,” said Sam. He stared at the ceiling. One hand
fidgeted with his spinner, the other twirled a tube of ChapStick. The
wall behind him was one big window. Outside, a small wan palm tree bent
in the wind. Beyond, on a field of asphalt, several young engineers
paced and counted their steps. “If he’s primarily wanting money, there
are a lot of people he could get it from,” said Sam. “He could syndicate
it in a week. It’s not the dollar amount. It’s about who has been nice
to him and who hasn’t.”</p>
<p>Down on the floor, Nishad looked dubious. Ramnik, beside him, was
harder to read.</p>
<p>“It will put us more on the map,” said Sam.</p>
<p>“Is there anything for which being even more on the map is useful
right now?” said Nishad.</p>
<p>Sam clearly thought so. Twitter fascinated him. It had turned out to
be the single best way for a person like him to communicate with a mass
audience. On Twitter, all the problems he had with people one-on-one
evaporated. “It’s moved markets five times more than anything else out
there,” he said. “It’s a very specific brand.”</p>
<p>“Would it be impolite to say seventy-five million?” asked Nishad.</p>
<p>“Twitter has two hundred thirty million daily active users,” said
Ramnik. “If you could get eighty million of them to pay for it—say, five
bucks a month—that’s four hundred million in revenues a month.” Ramnik
did this sometimes. He’d offer thoughts to buttress arguments Sam wanted
to make, even if Ramnik himself would rather he not make them.</p>
<p>“This is sort of a hilarious dynamic,” said Nishad, interrupting the
new train of thought. “Elon treating us as a proxy investment
vehicle.”</p>
<p>They kicked the decision around only a bit longer. The entire
discussion took no more than fifteen minutes. At some point Sam simply
decided they’d spent time enough for every possible useful thought on
the subject to be had and asked for a vote from the other two.</p>
<p>“No,” said Nishad.</p>
<p>“No, or a very low amount,” said Ramnik.</p>
<p>With that, the meeting ended. What I did not realize—but both Nishad
and Ramnik by now both just took for granted—was that Sam might still
hand over some large sum of money to Elon Musk. He was perfectly capable
of asking for a vote and then ignoring the result. Sure enough, all by
himself, Sam would soon ask Morgan Stanley, which was advising on and
helping to finance Musk’s Twitter purchase, if they would be willing to
lend him a billion dollars to invest in Twitter and accept his shares in
FTX as collateral. He would also message one of Musk’s financial
advisors to say he’d be willing to invest billion if Musk was willing to
move Twitter onto a blockchain. Twitter, like other social media
platforms, was on an island without any connection to the others; if you
put them on blockchains, they could all be linked up with each other.
When Musk refused, Sam lost interest and decided to invest nothing at
all. Six months later, he wouldn’t even know if he still owned 00
million worth of Twitter, or if the shares had been sold to Elon
Musk.</p>
<p>No one person had the full picture of the puzzle Sam had made out of
money. Ramnik likely had the clearest view of it, but even his view was
partial. Inside of three years, Sam would deploy roughly billion on a
portfolio of three hundred separate investments—which worked out to a
new investment decision roughly every three days. If Sam spent only
twenty minutes or so deciding whether to sink a billion dollars into
Twitter, it was because twenty minutes was all he could spare: so many
other investment decisions awaited. He’d invest in new crypto tokens,
like Solana, and old companies, like Anthony Scaramucci’s investment
firm, SkyBridge. He’d acquire companies obviously relevant to FTX—a
Japanese crypto exchange called Liquid, for instance—and companies that
had no obvious connection to crypto, like the studio that had developed
Storybook Brawl. The money nearly always came not from FTX but from
Alameda Research, which Ramnik and everyone else thought of as Sam’s
private fund. Often Ramnik was intimately involved with a purchase, but
nearly as often he only learned what Sam had done after the fact. Sam
had invested 00 million in an artificial intelligence start-up called
Anthropic, apparently without bouncing the idea off anyone else. “I said
to Sam after he did it, ‘We don’t know a fucking thing about this
company,’” said Ramnik. About the same time that he was trying to decide
whether to sink more money into Twitter, Sam was handing 50 million to a
former Jane Street trader named Lily Zhang, to create a second crypto
quant trading fund based in the Bahamas, called Modulo Capital. So far
as Ramnik could see, Sam had told no one about that until he’d done it.
Back in March, Sam had promised to invest billion with a Hollywood agent
turned investment manager named Michael Kives, without consulting Ramnik
or anyone else. Sam had only met Kives a few weeks before he’d made that
commitment. He’d known nothing about him, not even how to pronounce his
name.</p>
<p>When they heard that Sam was about to hurl billion at a total
stranger, Ramnik and others inside FTX became alarmed. With a lot of
help from FTX’s lawyers, Ramnik and Nishad had argued the billion down
to 00 million—or at least they thought that’s what Sam had agreed to.
Much later, Ramnik learned that Sam, as usual, simply did what he wanted
to do, and pledged to invest billion in various Kives-run investment
funds. “I think Sam’s too trusting,” said Ramnik. “He’s too trusting too
early.”</p>
<p>A lot of what got done inside Sam’s world got done without the usual
checks and balances. Others found it hard to complain too loudly. The
deals seemed to involve only Sam’s money: Why shouldn’t Sam be able to
do with it whatever he pleased? Still, there couldn’t be many other
cases in human history of a person his age tossing around dollars in the
amounts he was tossing them without much adult supervision, or the usual
constraints of corporate life. A board of directors, for instance. “It’s
unclear if we even have to have an actual board of directors,” said Sam,
“but we get suspicious glances if we don’t have one, so we have
something with three people on it.” When he said this to me, right after
his Twitter meeting, he admitted he couldn’t recall the names of the
other two people. “I knew who they were three months ago,” he said. “It
might have changed. The main job requirement is they don’t mind
DocuSigning at three a.m. DocuSigning is the main job.” Then there was
the CFO. For the past eighteen months, various venture capitalists whom
Sam had permitted to invest in FTX had been telling him that he should
hire a serious grown-up to act as the company’s chief financial officer.
“There’s a functional religion around the CFO,” said Sam. “I’ll ask
them, ‘Why do I need one?’ Some people cannot articulate a single thing
the CFO is supposed to do. They’ll say ‘keep track of the money,’ or
‘make projections.’ I’m like, What the fuck do you think I do all day?
You think I don’t know how much money we have?”</p>
<p>Back in Hong Kong, with The Schism still in mind, Sam had briefly
entertained the idea that it might be useful to have some older people
around. “We tried having some grown-ups, but they didn’t do anything,”
he said. “This was true for everyone over the age of forty-five. All
they did was worry. Here’s a classic grown-up thing: you freak the fuck
out about a Chinese government crackdown on crypto in Hong Kong. Their
job was to be serious about problems even if the problems were not
serious. And they weren’t able to identify serious problems. They were
terrified of regulators. Or taxes! Not that we wouldn’t pay it, but we’d
pay too much, and then we’d have a loss the next year, but we’d already
paid our taxes.” It wasn’t that Sam didn’t want to minimize his tax
bill, or that the Chinese might not at any moment swoop in and grab him
and toss him in prison. It was that the odds of the bad thing happening
were low, and any time spent thinking about it was wasted. “It was a
random series of completely disassociated concerns, most of which were
really overblown, stated very forcefully,” said Sam. “The only way to
calm them down was for a new concern to come along and distract them
from the other ones.”</p>
<p>The truth was that grown-ups bored him. All they did was slow him
down.</p>
<p>A few months later, toward the end of July 2022, I met Sam beside the
tarmac of a private airfield in Northern California. I’d driven there
from my home; he had come from a brief retreat with the leaders of
effective altruism where they’d talked about how to spend Sam’s money.
As usual, he was late. When he finally arrived, he didn’t so much step
as tumble out of the back of a black car. Instead of a suitcase, he
carried what appeared to be a small pile of old laundry. As he drew
closer, I saw that it was a blue suit and a button-down Brooks Brothers
shirt. “This is my DC suit,” he said, almost apologetically. “Normally I
leave it in DC.” Six hours in the future he was meant to have dinner
with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, whom he’d never met. He’d
been briefed that McConnell would be offended if he arrived in shorts.
“McConnell really cares about what you wear,” said Sam, as he walked up
the steps of the private plane and plopped the suit ball onto a spare
seat. “Also, you need to call him ‘Leader.’ Or ‘Leader McConnell’ or
‘Mister Leader.’ I rehearsed it to make sure I didn’t fuck it up.
Especially since it’s so tempting to say ‘Dear Leader.’”</p>
<p>I eyed the ball of clothes. Its wrinkles were not new and shallow but
old and deep, reversible only with time and effort. It was hard to see
how these clothes would be of any use in this situation.</p>
<p>“Do you have a belt?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I do not have a belt,” he said, as he reached into a basket of vegan
snacks, grabbed a sack of popcorn, and dropped into his seat.</p>
<p>“Shoes?”</p>
<p>“Uh, no shoes,” he said.</p>
<p>It was as if he’d only received a single explicit instruction: “Bring
a suit.” Whoever had sent it had neglected to add, “Make sure it’s
wearable and that you have whatever else you need to satisfy Mitch
McConnell’s need for his dinner companions to appear formally dressed,”
and so Sam had not bothered to consider what else might be needed for a
suit if it were to be successfully worn. He did this kind of thing a
lot. Seven months earlier, he’d testified about crypto regulation before
the House Financial Services Committee. Someone snapped a close-up of
his feet under the table: the laces of his new dress shoes were still
swaddled and gathered off to one side, as they come in the box. Someone
must have handed him the shoes and said, without further instruction,
“You should put these on.”</p>
<p>At any rate, this one item set Sam’s trips to Washington, DC, apart
from all the other trips he took. Only to DC did he carry a suit: the
stakes justified the sacrifice. In recent decades, the laws in the
United States had been loosened so that people and even corporations
could donate effectively unlimited sums of money to political campaigns
and super PACs, without the larger American public being able to see
exactly what they were doing, or why. What surprised Sam, once he
himself had unlimited sums of money, was how slowly rich people and
corporations had adapted to their new political environment. The US
government exerted massive influence on virtually everything under the
sun and maybe even a few things over it. In a single four-year term, a
president, working with Congress, directed roughly 5 trillion in
spending. And yet in 2016, the sum total of spending by all candidates
on races for the presidency and Congress came to a mere .5 billion. “It
just seems like there isn’t enough money in politics,” said Sam. “People
are underdoing it. The weird thing is that Warren Buffett isn’t giving
two billion dollars a year.”</p>
<p>Inside United States politics, Sam was creating yet another money
puzzle: even after he’d poured billions into various venture capital
investments, he was willing to spend hundreds of millions more to
influence public policy. Later, everything he did would be reinterpreted
more cynically than it was in real time, but even in real time a lot of
people had their questions about him, and a lot of the questions missed
the point. His political spending was distributed sloppily into three
buckets. The first, and smallest, bucket contained his narrow business
interests: a few million dollars donated to politicians and interest
groups willing to push for legislation that would allow Americans to
trade the crypto contracts on FTX inside the United States that
foreigners did on FTX outside of it. It struck him as yet another
strange and senseless feature of the grown-up world that the United
States, which was otherwise willing to subject its poorest and most
vulnerable citizens to state lotteries and casinos and other games of
chance in which the odds were stacked against them, made an exception
for securities, or anything that might be construed as securities. But
those were the rules of this new game, and Sam had decided, with some
doubts about their tractability, to try to change them—rather than do
what the other crypto exchanges were doing, which was simply to ignore
them.</p>
<p>Oddly, the money he gave to people to make it easier for him to make
even more money was the easiest money for others to see. All of it
without a whole lot of trouble could be traced back to Sam, or FTX or
crypto interest groups. It was the other two buckets—the money that had
little to do with his own narrow financial interests—that were opaque.
His attempts to change the world as he thought the world needed to be
changed had little to do with his business. But to be effective, he had
to hide what he was doing, lest others assume that the point of giving
was to shape crypto legislation. In some not unreasonable minds,
“crypto” was synonymous with “criminal.” “The problem was that if it
were disclosed, everyone would assume that it was crypto money,” he
said. Crypto money was harder to give away than it should have been, in
Sam’s opinion. Politicians and interest groups didn’t always like the
look of accepting it, even if they weren’t quite sure what that look
was. “There isn’t anything concrete there,” said Sam. “They’re just
uncomfortable.” Their discomfort could lead to strange outcomes. “We had
one group say, ‘You know, we really appreciate this, but it wouldn’t be
good for me to take money from FTX, so I can’t—besides, I have found
another source of funding.’ That other source of funding was Gabe, my
brother.”</p>
<p>In Sam’s mind, his money wasn’t crypto money. It was effective
altruist money that he happened to have obtained through crypto. Along
with his brother, Sam had looked at the world and decided that two
EA-related causes made more sense to address with his money than any of
the others. And that a lot of the money needed to be sneaky.</p>
<p>Their first, less sneaky initiative was pandemic prevention. On the
list of existential risks to humanity, pandemics occupied a special
place. Unlike, say, with an asteroid strike, the threat felt real, and
politicians could be persuaded to take it seriously. Unlike, say, with
climate change, hardly anyone was talking or thinking seriously about
how to address the problem—even after a million Americans had just died
from a new pathogen. Unlike, say, in preventing a war on humanity by
artificial intelligence, there were some obvious though expensive things
to do to mitigate the risk. For instance, someone really did need to
take the lead in the creation of a global system of disease prediction,
one that resembled the global system of weather prediction. Sam guessed
that it would take 00 billion, which put it beyond his reach. “If it
were ten times smaller, it’s possible I could just do it myself,” he
said. “If FTX winds up six times bigger than we are today, we’d have to
recompute that.” He might not have the money right now to do it himself,
but he did have the money to persuade the US government to do it. This
very issue was the stated, though not perhaps the biggest, reason for
his dinner with Mitch McConnell: to discuss an initiative to allocate 0
billion for pandemic response to an entity inside the Department of
Health and Human Services called the Biomedical Advanced Research and
Development Authority. McConnell was a Republican and in theory hostile
to big government expenditures. But Sam had already decided that these
politicians were far more complex devices than their tribal identities
might suggest. “He’s a polio survivor,” said Sam. “And we think he’s
interested.”</p>
<p>Badgering elected officials into taking an interest in pandemics was
one part of Sam’s strategy. The second part was getting some new
pandemic warriors elected to Congress. Sam’s political operation had
figured out, or thought they had, that it made a lot more sense to spend
money in primary than in general elections. Voters could be swayed in
primaries as they couldn’t in generals. Much of persuasion in primaries
was just name recognition, which you could buy with ads. They’d also
already figured out, or thought they had, that a million dollars dropped
into a close congressional primary gave them a one-in-five chance of
swinging it to their candidate. The problem was that they had no way to
determine in advance which of the five they’d be able to influence. And
so they’d adopted a strategy of finding as many congressional candidates
as they could who would support spending on pandemic prevention and
buying their elections in bulk, while at the same time doing their best
to disguise that the money involved had anything to do with crypto.</p>
<p>Of course, winning one out of five congressional races meant you lost
the other four. Sam’s political portfolio resembled his venture capital
portfolio: in pursuit of crazy rewards, it took what, after the fact,
looked like insane risks. In a very short time, Sam’s money had
bankrolled some of the most spectacular failures in the history of
political manipulation.</p>
<p>Carrick Flynn, for example. When Sam stumbled upon him, Carrick Flynn
was a newcomer to elective politics. He was the quintessential
Washington, DC, policy wonk—one of the faceless minions in blue suits
who sit along the wall behind the more important people and occasionally
rise and whisper something in their ears. Carrick Flynn’s most important
trait, in Sam’s view, was his total command of and commitment to
pandemic prevention. His second-most important trait was that he was an
effective altruist. He could be counted on to follow the math rather
than woolly-minded feelings. Conveniently, he had recently moved from DC
to a newly created left-leaning congressional district outside Portland,
Oregon. The seat felt so up for grabs that fifteen other candidates
would eventually jump into the race. Flynn asked some fellow EAs what
they thought about him running for Congress. As a political candidate he
had obvious weaknesses: in addition to being a Washington insider and a
bit of a carpetbagger, he was terrified of public speaking and sensitive
to criticism. He described himself as “very introverted.” And yet none
of the EAs could see any good reason for him not to go for it—and so
he’d thrown his hat into the ring. Somewhere along the EA trail he’d
become known to Sam. He had a sense that Sam might support him, but he
had no idea what that meant. The writer Dave Weigel captured the moment
he learned, in the opening of an article in the Washington Post:</p>
<p>“We were watching a YouTube video together, a tutorial about
something,” said Flynn, sitting with his wife, Kathryn Mecrow-Flynn,
after a U.S. Chamber of Commerce breakfast last week, where he and other
Democratic congressional candidates heard a presentation on suburban
crime.</p>
<p>“All of a sudden, we hear a voice say CARRICK FLYNN!” remembered
Mecrow-Flynn.</p>
<p>“And I had water in my hand,” said Flynn.</p>
<p>Mecrow-Flynn corrected him. “Mountain Dew,” she said.</p>
<p>“It would have been Diet Mountain Dew,” Flynn said, more
confidently.</p>
<p>Whatever he was drinking, Flynn had, at the sound of his own name in
a paid political advertisement, spilled it all over himself. It was the
first fusillade in the political equivalent of the D-Day invasion. Sam’s
political team took ten million dollars of Sam’s money, jammed it into
bazookas, and fired it into the Portland suburbs. This little primary
became the most expensive in Oregon history. Then it became the third
most expensive House Democratic primary in the entire country. Sam’s
attempt to turn Carrick Flynn into a congressman was less a political
campaign than an assault on the senses of the local population. “Being
in it really did feel like being in an episode of Veep,” said Tess
Seger, who ran the campaign of a rival Democrat. “The people who report
on the Trail Blazers were literally complaining how many Carrick Flynn
ads there were. The whole thing was kind of done unartfully.”</p>
<p>The effects of artlessness in politics are not predictable, but what
happened next made a kind of sense. People figured out where the money
was coming from to buy all these Carrick Flynn ads. The other eight
Democrats in the primary joined hands to denounce Carrick Flynn.
“Mr. Creepy Funds,” one of them called him. “This is a Bahamas
billionaire trying to buy a congressional district in Oregon,” said
another. And it was! Sam was trying to buy a seat in Congress so that
Congress might finally begin to address an existential risk to humanity.
The people of Oregon not only did not appreciate the effort; a lot of
them started to kind of hate Carrick Flynn. And Carrick Flynn was not
designed to ignore their feelings. Attacked by other candidates during a
debate, he simply walked out in the middle. His public statements began
to strike even his financial backers as erratic and unwise. “He got
really wounded when people said mean things about him,” said Sam. “He
insulted owls at one point, not realizing that there’s a huge owl
constituency in Oregon.”fn1</p>
<p>In the end, which came on May 17, 2022, Carrick Flynn received 19
percent of the popular vote and finished a respectable but distant
second to Andrea Salinas, who won with 37 percent of the vote. For every
vote Carrick Flynn won, Sam had spent just a bit less than a thousand
dollars. He actually didn’t mind all that much. He’d learned a lesson:
there were political candidates no amount of money could get elected.
“There are limits to what money can buy,” said Sam.</p>
<p>Anyway, to Sam, the money he’d spent on Carrick Flynn had been a drop
in his second bucket. Other congressional races had worked out better.
He also had one other and even more promising bucket—a vessel for
political spending that was yet harder to see into than the other two.
So that voters would not know where the money had come from, this bucket
would be largely controlled by Mitch McConnell, or friends of Mitch
McConnell. So that the disguise would be legal, Sam and McConnell would
not talk about how the bucket would be used. But the bucket was very
much the subtext of the dinner Sam was headed to, because in McConnell,
Sam had found someone as interested as he was in another existential
threat to humanity: Donald Trump. Trump’s assault on the government, and
on the integrity of US elections, belonged, to Sam’s way of thinking, on
the same list as pandemics and artificial intelligence and climate
change. Across the land, Republican primaries were littered with
candidates who were willing to behave as if the presidential election
had been stolen from Trump. They faced candidates who were forced to pay
lip service to the idea. McConnell’s people had already figured out
which was which, and McConnell was intent on defeating the former. “He’s
already done the work,” said Sam. The work, he added, was to distinguish
“people who would actually try to govern versus people who would
undermine the government.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Sam was planning to give 5–0 million to McConnell to
defeat the Trumpier candidates in the US Senate races. On a separate
front, he explained to me, as the plane descended into Washington, DC,
he was exploring the legality of paying Donald Trump himself not to run
for president. His team had somehow created a back channel into the
Trump operation and returned with the not terribly earth-shattering news
that Donald Trump might indeed have his price: billion. Or so Sam was
told by his team.</p>
<p>It was interesting, especially in retrospect, how well suited Sam’s
mind was to understanding Donald Trump. At that moment, his team was
using their mysterious line of communication into the Trump camp to seed
Trump’s mind with an idea. In Missouri, a rabid Trumper named Eric
Greitens was in what looked like a close race with a less enthusiastic
Trumper named Eric Schmitt. Schmitt wanted to govern; Greitens wanted to
tear things down. Trump had not yet weighed in on the race, and the fear
was that his endorsement might swing the election to Greitens. Sam’s
team had come up with an idea—which, Sam claimed, was just then making
its way to Trump himself. The idea was to persuade Trump to come out and
say “I’m for Eric!” without specifying which Eric he was for. After all,
Trump didn’t actually care who won. All he cared about was that he would
be seen to have backed the winner. If he said he was for Eric, he’d get
the credit for whichever Eric won. “I’m for Eric!” would attract even
more attention to Trump than a more specific endorsement, and the
attention is all Trump cared about in the end. “It’s very Trump,” said
Sam. “It’d become a meme.”</p>
<p>As he said that, he tossed popcorn in his mouth, in a herky-jerky
motion that resembled a clumsy layup. He was shooting around 60 percent,
and the popcorn was flying everywhere. He’d failed to catch a dish of
warm nuts as they’d hurtled past him during takeoff, and they too were
still scattered all around him. As he’d ordered the political world in
his mind, he’d created chaos in the space he inhabited. Finally we
landed, and he ran to his dinner, leaving the mess for someone else to
clean up.</p>
<p>We’d agreed to meet the morning after next at the town house on the
back side of Capitol Hill that served as the headquarters for Guarding
Against Pandemics, the organization that Sam paid for and which Gabe
ran. Once again he was late. Once again he tumbled out of the back of a
car, this time a regular DC taxicab. And once again he had in his hands
a balled-up suit—but this time, as he emerged from the car, a single
brown dress shoe fell out of the pile in his hands and into the street.
As he reached to grab it, the other shoe dropped and rolled under the
taxi. It was then that I noticed that the suit’s color had changed:
someone had taken the wrinkled suit he’d arrived carrying and replaced
it with another, pressed one, reduced now to laundry. I watched as Sam
entered the empty town house, opened a closet, and, without so much as a
glance at the row of empty hangers, tossed the ball of clothes onto the
closet floor. We then drove together to the airport and returned to the
Bahamas.</p>
<p>Two days later Trump announced, in a post on Truth Social, his
intention to name his choice in the Missouri Senate race. Next, he
released a written statement: “ERIC has my Complete and Total
Endorsement!”fn2</p>
<p>The sun was setting on the Albany resort when the effective altruists
gathered to discuss how they might give their money away. Like rich
people dressed up for a formal occasion, the buildings surrounding the
marina looked their best when the light was lowered. In midday sun they
were just seven crass blindingly white monstrosities barely
distinguishable from one another. Only after sunset, when they became
unnaturally lit, did their names make any sense. The facade of a
building named Honeycomb became a stack of wax hexagons. The one called
Cube revealed itself to be a beguilingly uneven jumble of rectangles.
Orchid—the building closest to the ocean, the one with the most sweeping
views—was more subtle. It looked nothing like an orchid in any light,
but its exterior was wrapped with an aluminum sheath whose pattern was
meant to call to mind the tropical flower—in the same way that the
planned exterior of FTX’s new headquarters was supposed to evoke Sam’s
Jewfro. At night its penthouse was lit purple, and the purple light made
it seem glamorous, and elicited envy even from those accustomed to being
envied. That’s where the effective altruists all lived, at least until
Caroline booted Sam out. Gary, Nishad, Caroline, and Sam’s best friend
from college, Adam Yedidia, slept in more or less identical bedrooms,
all but Caroline with their romantic partners.</p>
<p>The interior of Orchid’s penthouse contained even more stuff to be
impressed by, if you were the sort of person impressed by stuff. Eleven
thousand five hundred square feet of marble floors had been tricked out
with enough luxury to persuade any normal rich person who lived inside
it that whatever sacrifice he’d made to acquire such a thing surely was
worth it. The problem was that the rich people inside were not normal.
The effective altruists already had half ruined the splendor. One wall
was now obscured by a row of computer monitors whose cords snaked across
the marble like jungle vines. A cheap Ikea-like bookshelf groaned under
the weight of the EAs’ favorite board games: Galaxy Trucker, Wingspan, 7
Wonders, more than one chess set. The living room had been surrendered
to a massive video game monitor. Alongside the various crystal and
silver tchotchkes that had obviously come with the place, the effective
altruists had deposited, without rhyme or reason, a lot of random crap
they’d been too lazy to chuck: books their authors had given Sam that
he’d never read, a football that Shaquille O’Neal had signed and given
to Sam, fan gear sent by various professional sports leagues. In effect,
they’d turned a 0 million condominium into a flophouse. From their
wraparound sixth-floor balcony they had a view to die for, and yet they
seldom so much as glanced at it. Just below was a semi-private beach so
close that from their balcony Tom Brady could have thrown Shaq’s
football onto it. A year into his new life in the Bahamas, Nishad Singh
had stepped onto that beach just once, and then only because some
relatives were visiting. That was once more than Sam, and likely Gary
too.</p>
<p>Caroline appeared with a glass of wine, which here counted as an act
of hedonism, and the meeting began. From the moneymaking division of
FTX, it was just her, Sam, Gary, and Nishad; from the money-giving side
were the four employees who worked for FTX’s philanthropic wing. They
shared their employer’s habit of turning life decisions into expected
value calculations, and their inner math yielded similarly surprising
results. In 2020, Avital Balwit had won a Rhodes Scholarship and turned
it down, first to run Carrick Flynn’s congressional campaign and then to
give away FTX’s money. Leopold Aschenbrenner, who had entered Columbia
University at the age of fifteen and graduated four years later as class
valedictorian, had just declined a spot at Yale Law School to work for
this new philanthropy. Their boss, a former Oxford philosopher named
Nick Beckstead, was also present, as was their spiritual guru, Will
MacAskill—who was of course in some way responsible for everyone,
including Sam, even being there.</p>
<p>Since MacAskill had first sold Sam, back in the fall of 2012, on the
idea of earning to give, the EA movement had obviously changed. It had
become a lot less interested in saving the lives of existing human
beings than future ones. In early 2020, movement cofounder Toby Ord had
published a book, The Precipice, which laid out where his thinking (and
that of everyone in the penthouse) had been for a while now. In it he
offered up rough estimates of the likelihood of various existential
risks to humanity. The chance of a stellar explosion he put at one in a
billion, and an asteroid strike at one in a million. The man-made risks
of nuclear bombs and climate change had a one in a thousand chance of
wiping out the entire species. A man-made pathogen—as opposed to a
naturally arising disease—he gave a one in thirty chance. The most
likely threat to humanity, Ord argued, was runaway artificial
intelligence. He put the odds of AI ending life as we know it at one in
ten. “If it happens, it wipes us all out,” explained Sam. “Where with
biological risk, even if it gets really bad, I dunno, it doesn’t have
the intelligence to weed out the stragglers the way AI could.”</p>
<p>One response to these sorts of calculations is that they are a kind
of gonzo science fiction. No one actually knows what the odds of any of
these things are, and your willingness to make up some numbers should
render you less, not more, credible on the subject. And yet … there
clearly is some chance that all of these terrible things might occur.
And if there is some chance, how can you not try to figure out what that
chance might be? You are free to quibble about the specific odds. Once
you’re in the argument, however, you’ll find it difficult to escape a
certain logic: the expected value of reducing even the minuscule
likelihood of an existential threat to all future human beings is far
greater than the expected value of anything you might do to save the
lives of the people who currently happen to be alive. “The core argument
was like, look, the future is vast,” said Sam. “You can try to put a
number on it but obviously anything that flows through to that is going
to have a vast multiplier.”</p>
<p>One day some historian of effective altruism will marvel at how
easily it transformed itself. It turned its back on living people
without bloodshed or even, really, much shouting. You might think that
people who had sacrificed fame and fortune to save poor children in
Africa would rebel at the idea of moving on from poor children in Africa
to future children in another galaxy. They didn’t, not really—which
tells you something about the role of ordinary human feeling in the
movement. It didn’t matter. What mattered was the math. Effective
altruism never got its emotional charge from the places that charged
ordinary philanthropy. It was always fueled by a cool lust for the most
logical way to lead a good life.</p>
<p>At any rate, the people sitting around Sam’s living room and talking
about where Sam’s money was being spent weren’t talking about buying bed
nets for children in Africa, to prevent malaria. They were looking for
clever ways to reduce existential risk. The sums they were able to give
away were about to increase dramatically—or so they all imagined. After
handing out 0 million in 2021, they were on pace to hand out 00 million
in 2022, and then billion in 2023. As Nishad had put it to me not long
before, “We’re finally going to stop talking about doing good and start
doing it.”</p>
<p>The list of things they had just done or were about to do was—well,
soon it would be entirely irrelevant. But in retrospect it would be
interesting for other reasons. They spoke for some time about proposals
they had received and might fund. For instance, a Stanford economist
hoped to start a new university focused exclusively on artificial
intelligence and biotech and recruit as part of its student population
young people from lower- and middle-income families in developing
countries. An engineer at a think tank that specialized in catastrophic
risk wanted to launch a communications satellite that would serve as a
backup channel for emergency services if 911 ever went down. An outfit
called the Apollo Academic Surveys, using FTX money, had created a
mechanism to quickly determine what expert consensus was on any topic.
Oddly, only economics had such a tool. The first question they put to it
was how likely it was for the earth to be destroyed by an asteroid. Not
that likely, as it turned out. “One less thing to worry about,” said
Avital.</p>
<p>They’d been doing this for only a year and already had been pitched
nearly two thousand such projects. They’d handed out some money but in
the process they’d concluded that conventional philanthropy was kind of
dumb. Just to deal with the incoming requests—most of which they had no
ability to evaluate—would require a big staff and lots of expense. Much
of their money would end up being used on a vast bureaucracy. And so
they had just recently adopted a new approach: instead of giving money
away themselves, they scoured the world for subject matter experts who
might have their own, better ideas for how to give away money. Over the
previous six months, one hundred people with deep knowledge of pandemic
prevention and artificial intelligence had received an email from FTX
that said, in effect: Hey, you don’t know us, but here’s a million
dollars, no strings attached. Your job is to give it away as effectively
as you can. The FTX Foundation, started in early 2021, would track what
these people did with their million dollars, but only to determine if
they should be given even more. “We try not to be very judgy once they
have the money,” said Sam. “But maybe we won’t be reupping them.” The
hope was, first, that these people on the ground would know better than
anyone what to do with the money and, second, that some people might
actually have a genius for giving away money. “It’s trying to blast
through the hesitation,” said Sam. “The default to inaction.”</p>
<p>The effective altruists finished their first meeting at midnight,
then returned the next night and talked until one in the morning. Nishad
and Sam talked some, Caroline sipped wine and talked less, Gary said
nothing at all. They were moving fast, as Sam always did. “If you throw
away a quarter of the money, that’s very sad,” he said at one point,
“but if it allows you to triple the effectiveness of the rest, that’s a
win.”</p>
<p>Here was yet another game. The game was for him and Nishad and Gary
and Caroline to generate hundreds of billions of dollars and use it to
reduce the likelihood of the grand experiment coming to an end. Like all
the games Sam loved, this game was played on a clock. He’d somehow
decided that the odds were low that he, or really most people, would do
anything important after about the age of forty. If he didn’t sleep, or
exercise, or eat properly, and always preferred action over inaction,
here was why. He had to move fast. He didn’t think the later years of
his own life contained much expected value. To do their bit to save the
species, he figured they had maybe ten or at most fifteen years.</p>
<p>As it would turn out, they had five weeks.</p>
<p>As late as the final days of October 2022, you could have ransacked
the jungle huts until you were blue in the face and have had not the
faintest sense that anything was amiss. Walking across the acres of
asphalt toward jungle hut 27, I bumped into Ramnik and his wife, Mallika
Chawla. Even as the price of bitcoin tumbled, Ramnik’s mood hit new
highs every day. Using Sam’s money—or what he assumed was Sam’s money—he
was playing a new and curious role in crypto finance. Between the start
of the boom in 2017 and June of 2022, crypto had re-created the
institutions of traditional finance, without the rules and regulations
and investor protections that exist in traditional finance. It had
brokers. It also had its own banks and sort of banks that paid crypto
interest on crypto deposits—though did not offer insurance on those
deposits. The banks re-lent that money at higher rates of interest to
crypto hedge funds—without anyone having really any idea what those
hedge funds were doing with the money. It had exchanges that did not
merely facilitate crypto trades but also warehoused their customers’
money—without any regulator paying a whole lot of attention to how they
did this. It even had the equivalent of US dollars, in the form of
stablecoins. These were digital currencies on a blockchain, like
bitcoin, but, unlike bitcoin, backed by actual dollars. For every
dollar’s worth of a stablecoin, there was meant to be a dollar held
somewhere in a genuine Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation–insured
bank. But again, there was no proof that these dollars were there.</p>
<p>The whole edifice relied on a fantastic amount of trust. By late
October that trust was gone, and crypto was in a souped-up version of an
old-fashioned financial crisis. In late June, the second-biggest hedge
fund after Alameda Research, Three Arrows Capital, had blown up. The
banks and sort of banks had suffered runs and collapsed. Unlike in a
traditional finance crisis, there was no government to step in and calm
everyone down. The 2008 financial crisis had only subsided after
governments had agreed to bail out the banks. The 2022 crypto crisis
lacked this mechanism. Instead of governments, crypto had Sam. Or,
rather, it had Ramnik, who was busily evaluating which of the failed
crypto businesses to save and which to let die. Sam had never been more
important and so, by association, neither had Ramnik. “It’s a reflection
of a collapse of trust,” said someone close to the business. “Now it’s
trust in Sam.”</p>
<p>Trust in Sam meant trust in Ramnik, who was just then putting the
finishing touches on the purchase of two failed crypto banks, Voyager
Digital and BlockFi. At their peak, they’d together been valued at
roughly billion. Now Ramnik was acquiring them for no more than 00
million. A pittance.</p>
<p>Or so it seemed. Ramnik recently had asked Sam how much capital he
should assume was available for possible acquisitions, and Sam had said,
Just let me know if you get to a billion. Two years earlier, Ramnik was
just a guy hoping to be able to walk to work in the morning. Now he was
the right-hand man to the J. P. Morgan of crypto. In the presence of his
wife, he glowed with the pleasure and the glory of it all.</p>
<p>“What I don’t get is how he knows how to do all this,” I said to his
wife, as we walked into jungle hut number 27.</p>
<p>“I know!” she said brightly. “I ask him that all the time. How do you
know? He just knows.”</p>
