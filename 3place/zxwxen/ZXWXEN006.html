<h4 id="the-march-of-progress">4 The March of Progress</h4>
<p>The Jane Street trading floor was one big room with lots of weird
sounds. The sound effects were selected to alert traders that there
might be some problem or issue that they should attend to. The shriek of
glass shattering warned traders that their machines had done some trade
at a weirdly bad price, for instance. The “1-Up” sound from Super Mario
Bros., Homer Simpson saying “D’oh!,” a voice from the original StarCraft
game that boomed, “You Must Construct Additional Pylons!”—if you didn’t
know what was going on, it sounded like an arcade. In busier moments the
din reached the point that one job candidate, being interviewed by
phone, complained that her Jane Street interviewer was playing video
games. After that, Jane Street instructed its traders to explain before
all phone interviews that they weren’t playing video games. “The sound
drives some people crazy,” said Sam. “I loved it. It immersed you in the
trading.”</p>
<p>There was a dance between financial markets and the people who worked
in them. The people shaped the markets, but then the markets in turn
shaped the people. The markets that were about to shape Sam
Bankman-Fried had themselves, over the previous decade or so, been
reshaped in ways that mostly reduced the sounds they made. The 2008
financial crisis wasn’t exactly responsible for what was going on, but
it had played a role. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley that had once taken the most interesting trading risks had
become clunkier and more heavily regulated. They were being shoved into
the boring Wall Street role once played by the big commercial banks. The
trading action had moved into a new class of private trading firms
shrouded in secrecy. By 2014, when Sam started as a full-time trader at
Jane Street Capital, the financial institutions at the center of
markets—those setting the prices of global assets—were not the old
investment banks but opaque high-frequency trading firms, like Jane
Street, that basically no one had ever heard of. The sums of money made
by the people who ran these places were orders of magnitude greater than
what the people who ran the big investment banks had ever made. In 2013,
the guy who’d created Virtu Financial, Vinnie Viola, shelled out a
quarter of a billion dollars for the Florida Panthers hockey team. The
guy who created Citadel Securities, Ken Griffin, was worth .2 billion,
according to Forbes. Jane Street didn’t disclose profits, even to
employees, but Sam could see the full record of its trades and guessed
that in each of the previous five years it likely had made profits of at
least a couple of billion dollars for its handful of partners. “By 2014
you just had to look at the average IQ of the people going to Morgan
Stanley and the people going to Jane Street to know what was happening,”
said Sam.</p>
<p>The new financial markets had some peculiar properties. For a start,
they were increasingly automated. People didn’t trade directly with
people. People programmed computers to trade with other computers.
Removing humans enabled financial trades to happen faster and more
frequently than ever before. Speed became maybe the single most valuable
attribute in a trading system. The markets were engaged in a kind of
information deforestation—an attempt to reduce to zero the amount of
time it took for any piece of information to be registered in the prices
of financial assets. “It’s the most complex and efficient game in the
world,” said Sam. “More effort has gone into optimizing the game than
has gone into anything else.” From the sums of money being extracted
from the game—and the sums of money being handed by high-frequency
trading firms to US stock exchanges for faster access to their data—you
could see that an advantage of a few milliseconds was clearly worth
billions a year to whoever possessed it. Whether the speed added
anything of value to the economy was another question: Did it really
matter if asset prices adjusted to new information in two milliseconds
rather than a second? Probably not, but the new technology definitely
made it possible for the financial sector to raise the rents that it
charged the real economy.</p>
<p>It also changed the kind of person who was extracting those rents. As
late as the summer of 2014 you could still see, in the shapes of the
bodies on the Jane Street trading floor, the changes that had occurred
in financial markets. The older traders, anyone over the age of thirty,
were built differently than the younger ones. They were bigger and
taller. Their voices were louder. The people who had founded Jane Street
back in 1999 were a motley crew of white guys from all over the place.
They’d come of age at a time when trading was still done human-to-human,
either on trading floors or in trading pits. In a crowd their bodies
needed to be seen and their voices needed to be heard. They were also
less obviously intellectually gifted. They tended to be quick at mental
math but less good at higher-order analytical thinking. On one of those
“March of Progress” charts that dramatized the evolution from ape to man
they represented perhaps the penultimate stage of Financial Man: hair
mostly gone, nearly upright, but still carrying a club on their
shoulder, which they used to impose a greater taste for hierarchy on the
more egalitarian younger traders.</p>
<p>The younger traders were full Homo sapiens. They’d been harvested
from the tiny slice of the population identified early in life as having
a gift for higher-order thinking. Many had gone to math camp in high
school. Almost all had excelled in computer science or math at MIT,
Harvard, Princeton, or Stanford. They were less socially adept than the
older traders, because they could afford to be. Now that trading was
done machine-to-machine, it mattered less how well traders negotiated
with other people. What mattered was their ability to help the machine
replace humans in financial markets—either directly, by writing code, or
indirectly, by giving instructions that might be codified. To their
minds it was silly not to just let the computer do all the mental
math.</p>
<p>But there were limits to how socially off-putting a trader could be
at Jane Street. Sam had tested them. After his summer internship, he’d
set out to address his superiors’ criticisms. He’d long since realized
that his inability to convey emotion created a distance between himself
and others. Just because he didn’t feel the emotion didn’t mean he
couldn’t convey it. He’d started with his facial expressions. He
practiced forcing his mouth and eyes to move in ways they didn’t
naturally. “It’s not totally trivial to fake things,” he said. “It was
physically painful. It felt unnatural. And I wasn’t good at it. It
didn’t look right.”</p>
<p>In the beginning he was unsure whether his efforts would be an
improvement on the status quo, but he suspected they couldn’t make
things worse. An ability to smile would not have changed how he treated
Asher Mellman, but it might have changed the way other people felt about
it. An ability to signal to others how he felt about whatever they had
said or done would, at the very least, avoid a lot of misunderstanding.
Sure enough, on the trading floor he finally began to see a smoothening
in the surface of his relationships with other people. “It wasn’t until
Jane Street that I got decent at it,” he said. “It became easier. Like
my muscles started to loosen up. And it made people like me more. It
made me able to fit in better.”</p>
<p>Jane Street had installed him on what was then the firm’s most
profitable desk, the one that traded international ETFs. Exchange-traded
funds pooled assets (stocks, bonds, commodities) that might otherwise be
difficult for investors to buy on their own. The first US-listed ETF
ever, hatched in 1993, was still the biggest: a fund created by the
American Stock Exchange and State Street Global Advisors that contained
all the stocks in the SandandandandP 500. Later there’d be ETFs for
everything. ETFs that held only stocks of small Indian companies, or big
Brazilian ones. ETFs filled with fishing industry stocks, or only the
shares of marijuana companies, or only the companies Warren Buffett
invested in. Any investment idea you could dream up could be expressed
in the form of an ETF and sold to the investing public—in 2021 someone
created an ETF that invested in companies whose products were beloved by
upper-middle-class American women. Without ever tapping outside capital,
Jane Street had gone from a few traders with a few million dollars, in
1999, to roughly two hundred traders working with several billion
dollars, in 2014. One big reason was ETFs, whose global value had grown
from less than 00 billion to .2 trillion (on its way to more than 0
trillion in 2022). When ETFs changed hands, Jane Street was often
present to take an ant-bite-sized piece of the transaction.</p>
<p>The role of the Jane Street trader—one of the biggest sources of
profits—was to keep the prices of all of these ETFs in line with the
assets inside of them. The price of any pool of assets should always, in
theory, be equal to the sum of the assets in the pool. Trading an ETF
was like trading a ham and cheese sandwich, as one Jane Street trader
put it. If you know the price of a slice of ham, a slice of cheese, and
a slice of bread, you know what the price of the sandwich should be: the
sum of the ingredients. If the cost of the ingredients exceeded the
price of the sandwich, you bought the sandwich and sold the ingredients.
If the price of the sandwich exceeded the cost of the ingredients, you
bought the ingredients and sold the sandwich.</p>
<p>Part of Sam’s day was spent bringing the price of lots of ham and
cheese sandwiches into line with the cost of their ingredients. He spent
the first ninety minutes of every trading day just figuring out what was
inside the sandwich—as overnight the precise content of the ETFs would
change. The least exciting part of his job, the sandwich game was not
without its moments. The companies that created ETFs essentially
exported the problem of pricing their creations to Jane Street and other
high-frequency trading firms. If some investor showed up and said they
wanted to buy, say, 00 million worth of some ETF filled with Indian
stocks, they’d be directed to Sam, who would give them a price. To
determine the price, Sam couldn’t make some simple calculation, using
the current prices of the stocks inside the ETF, once he’d figured out
what those were. He’d eventually need to buy the individual stocks, and
his demand would drive their prices up by some difficult-to-know amount.
He’d also have to pay Indian financial transaction taxes—so he needed to
take that into account.</p>
<p>The Indian stock exchange didn’t open until 9:15 a.m. Mumbai time, or
11:45 p.m. New York time. Until it opened, Sam would be unable to buy
Indian stocks and would remain exposed to any news that might affect the
market. He’d need to consider the identity of the ultimate buyer, as
some buyers were likely to have better information about Indian stocks
than he did. He’d also need to consider the possibility that one or more
of the other high-frequency trading firms asked to offer the stock were
about to front-run the trade and drive Indian stock prices higher. On
top of it all, he had maybe fifteen seconds to come up with a
price—though if he were lucky he’d have a bit of warning and maybe a few
hours to think it over. Either way, other traders were always competing
to do the same trade. On any given trade, there was never a lot of
fat.</p>
<p>And so these ETF trades weren’t riskless. As a rule, Sam was always
choosing which weighted coin to flip. And the real world seldom offered
you coins weighted dramatically in your favor. You didn’t get to flip an
80-20 coin; if you were lucky, you flipped a 60-40 coin; more likely you
spent most of your day flipping a 53-47 coin. Of course, even a coin
weighted in your favor would land on the wrong side on lots of flips,
and so even if you did your job well you might lose money. The idea at
the heart of Jane Street’s business was to make sure no single flip, or
flipper, made all that much difference. The firm’s two hundred traders
all had some unusual aptitude for identifying weighted coins.
Collectively they flipped coins millions of times a day. The law of
averages would eventually enforce itself. But Jane Street still had
losing trading days, and losing trading weeks and even, rarely, losing
trading months.fn1 “The biggest risk was that we wouldn’t find enough
coins to flip,” said Sam.</p>
<p>Like all the Jane Street traders, Sam was forever looking for ways to
automate his trading decisions. As the writer Byrne Hobart put it, Jane
Street traders were engaged “in a constant process of finding and
extending the efficient frontier of where computers can replace humans
in finance.” The job of the Jane Street trader was not simply to
optimize financial markets but to optimize himself, by keeping his
attention focused on the most valuable decision he might make. Teach the
machine to make certain decisions and you freed yourself up to go
looking for new weighted coins to flip. To empower the machine, you
needed only to identify the patterns in markets that could be captured
in computer code. Do that and, when investors asked you to offer 00
million worth of the Indian ETF, you didn’t need to sit and calculate
the financial transaction taxes you’d pay, the degree to which the buyer
was toxic, or even how much the prices of various Indian stocks were
likely to rise when the market opened. You could just hit a button, and
the machine would make the judgments, and the trade would happen, or
not.</p>
<p>Of course, you still had to keep one eye on it. If, say, a nuclear
bomb had exploded in Mumbai after the close of the Indian stock market,
you didn’t want a pre-programmed machine buying and selling stock. The
Jane Street trader treated the machines as robot arms; they allowed you
to do a lot more than you could with your own naked arms, but you still
had to stick your own arms into them for them to operate. Most of the
time the machine was far better than the human at trading decisions,
especially when the human only had fifteen seconds to think about them.
“I felt most valuable when I was identifying areas where it hadn’t been
automated but could be automated,” said Sam. “It was better than people,
because the people had to do it so fast.”</p>
<p>Jane Street made money in the sandwich business. Jane Street also
made money by finding statistical patterns missed by others in the
markets. Of course, traders have sought patterns missed by markets for
as long as anyone has traded anything. The difference between what
happened at Jane Street and what happened on, say, a Wall Street trading
floor in the 1980s was one of degree rather than of kind. Data had fully
replaced feel. The standard procedure at the firm was for the traders to
watch the machines trading out of the corner of their eye while they ran
little research projects. (The trading occupied roughly the same place
in Sam’s attention that video games later would.) A trader on the
international ETF desk, for instance, might start with the following
question: When the price of oil moves during US trading hours, what
happens to the ETFs filled with stocks of companies in big oil-producing
countries whose markets are closed? If oil prices pop higher during
lunchtime in New York City, the shares of, say, Nigerian companies will
probably follow them higher—but the Nigerian stock market is closed.
ETFs filled with Nigerian stocks, however, are live and trading on US
exchanges. Perhaps these US-listed ETFs did not respond as quickly as
they should have to movements in oil prices? Perhaps there is a chance
to anticipate the rise that will inevitably occur in Nigerian stocks
when the Nigerian stock market opens tomorrow? Perhaps others had not
thought of this? There was no way to answer those questions without
running a study of the historical price movements. Jane Street’s traders
spent a lot of their time engaged in these financial research
projects.</p>
<p>It wasn’t enough for the trader to make money. You needed to be able
to explain why you were making money. A great trader at Jane Street was
not a great trader unless he could explain why he was a great trader—and
why some great trade existed. As one former trader put it, “It was, Why
are you great, and how do we replicate you? And if you could not answer
the question, they doubted you.” But these little research projects
didn’t need to begin in a dignified way, with some theory about why some
market might be inefficient. Often they’d be triggered by some weird
event the trader had observed while trading. For example, you might
notice, as Sam once did, that exactly twelve hours after the price of
certain South Korean stocks rose on the Seoul stock exchange, the price
of certain other Japanese stocks rose on the Tokyo stock exchange. Your
first thought might be that this is merely a coincidence. But then it
keeps happening. You dig into some old data and find that the same thing
has been happening in these stocks for several months. You might trade
on it—and buy the Japanese stocks the instant the South Korean stocks
rise. You might even make money.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t have satisfied the Jane Street system, however, because
you didn’t know why the Japanese stocks were rising in price twelve
hours after the South Korean stocks. And so you looked even further into
it—as Sam had. And he found that the prices of both the South Korean and
the Japanese ETFs were being driven by a single trader at a German bank.
Every few days, the German bank trader had a bunch of buy orders to
execute, in both South Korea and Japan. He’d make his South Korean
purchases before calling it a day, passing the Japan orders off to his
Asian colleagues to handle when they awakened in Tokyo. The Jane Street
trader could now happily see the pop in the South Korean ETF and buy the
Japanese ETF until the German died, retired, or figured out how much his
laziness was costing him.</p>
<p>Sam found lots of trades whose success turned on the idiocy of some
other trader or trading algorithm. Asher trades. For a two-week stretch,
Canada’s main stock market index behaved weirdly at the opening every
morning. At 9:30 it would pop higher or drop lower with unusual violence
and then, at 9:31, revert to its previous levels. That wasn’t how a
market normally behaved in response to news. Something else was going
on. Sam made a study and discovered that a month earlier, someone had
done a massive, multibillion-dollar-contract-sized trade in options on
the Canadian stock market index. The trader who had done it needed to
hedge his position whenever the price of the Canadian index moved. To do
this, the trader had created a bot, which mindlessly bought the Canadian
index when it went up, and sold the Canadian index when it went down,
thus causing it to go either up or down more than it otherwise would
have done. On days the Canadian stock market opened at a higher price
than the day before, the bot would buy the index, driving its price even
higher, requiring the bot to buy even more. It did the same thing in
reverse when the index opened at a lower price than the day before. For
two weeks Sam’s trading desk made a small fortune simply by selling the
Canadian index after the bot had bought it, and buying the Canadian
index after the bot had sold it, until the trader who had created the
bot wised up and turned it off. “It was essentially reverse engineering
someone else’s dumb algo,” said Sam.</p>
<p>The constant hunt for statistical patterns in markets led to all
sorts of strange insights. Every time Brazil won a World Cup match, the
Brazilian stock market tanked, for instance, because the win was thought
to increase the shot at reelection of Brazilian president Dilma
Rousseff, perceived to be corrupt. A faster and better sense of the
Brazilian soccer team’s odds in the next match gave you a weighted coin
to flip in the Brazilian stock market. In late October of 2016—to take
another example—global stock markets were moving around noticeably in
response to any news that seemed to alter Donald Trump’s chances of
becoming president. At that moment, the upcoming election seemed as if
it might be the most consequential election for global financial markets
in modern times. The traders on Jane Street’s international ETF desk
kicked around ideas about how to trade it. And someone pointed out just
how slowly, by high-frequency trading standards, election results found
their way into financial markets.</p>
<p>Sam took the lead on this particular research project. There was no
standardized national system for reporting the vote in a US presidential
election. Fifty states decided how and when to release their election
data. Some states moved more slowly than others. Some states had decent
websites to aggregate totals; others didn’t. “Most states had like
seventeen different websites,” said Sam. Even if the states were somehow
maximally efficient in their data collection, it seemed likely there was
a lag before the results reached the financial markets. “At Jane Street
almost everyone had the same intuition,” said Sam. “That it would be
surprising if you couldn’t do this.”</p>
<p>That is, it would be surprising if Jane Street couldn’t learn the
results of the presidential election before anyone else in the financial
markets or for that matter the entire world. After all, the financial
markets still learned whatever had happened the same way the general
public did, by watching John King on CNN. John King wasn’t built to
maximize the returns for high-frequency traders. “They had commercials
so John King couldn’t be worried about a two-minute delay,” said Sam.
“Plus it took him fifteen seconds to walk across the room to his map.”
The Jane Street traders had grown so accustomed to acquiring information
faster than others in financial markets that they just assumed they
could do it in political markets, too.</p>
<p>In short order they’d built a model—similar to those used by the news
networks and the FiveThirtyEight political forecasting website—to make
sense of the information they were about to gather faster than anyone
else. Sam recruited young traders from other desks to make themselves
expert on local voting data. To each state, he assigned a Jane Street
trader to locate the fastest source of election data. One trader took
Michigan; another, Florida. And so on. Getting the voting data more
quickly than everyone else, Sam and his fellow Jane Street traders
assumed, was the hard part. The smart trading strategy seemed so obvious
that they didn’t give it nearly as much thought. In the weeks leading up
to the election, there had been a pattern: stock markets everywhere
tanked on good news for Trump, and rose on good news for Clinton. Good
news for Trump had proven to be bad news especially in emerging markets,
like Mexico. The Jane Street trading plan wasn’t all that complicated.
They’d get the voting results before everyone else, that data would
shift the odds of the election in one direction or the other, and they’d
buy or sell both US and emerging market stocks in response.</p>
<p>On the night of November 8, 2016, the machine Sam designed and
supervised worked beautifully. The Jane Street traders were indeed able
to get a jump on CNN, sometimes by seconds, usually by minutes, and
occasionally by hours. “Trump up!” one Jane Street trader would shout,
and some other Jane Street trader would sell stocks. Five minutes later
John King would confirm the fact, and the market would move.</p>
<p>As the evening wore on, Jane Street’s worries that other
high-frequency trading firms might be doing the same trade eased.
“Markets were moving at the speed of CNN, not the speed of data,” said
Sam. “We were confident we had better info than the market. We had a
sense that if anyone else was doing this, they were very small.” Seven
times that evening voting results arrived that swung the odds by as much
as 5 percent in one direction or the other, and seven times Jane Street
was ahead of the market move. The results from the Florida Panhandle
were the most dramatic. After the early votes were counted, it appeared
that Clinton had won Florida—and thus probably the election. Florida was
so important, and the Panhandle went so powerfully for Trump, that in
Jane Street’s model it swung his odds of winning the presidency from 5
percent to 60 percent. “We saw the Florida Panhandle before John King
saw it,” said Sam. “We even had time to freak out, to think there must
be a typo, to see that there wasn’t a typo and say, Fuck it, let’s
sell!”</p>
<p>By the time they’d finished, Jane Street had placed a bet of several
billion dollars against the SandandandandP 500 and another quarter of a
billion or so against the stock markets of other countries, especially
Mexico, whose economies were most likely to be damaged by a Trump
presidency. Around one in the morning, after twenty-four thrilling hours
without a break, Sam left the trading desk to get some sleep. The
markets seemed to have fully digested the news of Trump’s victory. Jane
Street was sitting on maybe the single most profitable trade it had ever
done. “It was the most exhilarating day I ever had at Jane Street,” Sam
said.</p>
<p>Three hours later he returned to find that the markets had changed
their minds about the likely effects of Donald Trump on the world’s
stock markets. “It was supposed to be Armageddon,” said Sam. “And maybe
it was. But it wasn’t Armageddon for US markets.” Markets in the United
States actually had rallied, and most of the Jane Street bet was against
the US stock market. “What had been a three-hundred-million-dollar
profit for Jane Street was now a three-hundred-million-dollar loss,”
said Sam. “It went from single most profitable to single worst trade in
Jane Street history.” Plus Donald Trump was now president of the United
States, a fact that did not please Sam or anyone else he knew at Jane
Street. “The universe was a cruel joke,” he said.</p>
<p>He was struck by what Jane Street did next: not much. There was no
big firm-wide formal postmortem. No one was punished, or even
questioned. On the one hand, Sam admired the way the firm distinguished
process from outcome. A bad outcome, in and of itself, did not suggest
anyone had done anything wrong, any more than a good outcome suggested
anyone had done anything right. “Jane Street really didn’t like blaming
people,” said Sam. “They sort of asked, ‘Did anyone do anything contrary
to what they were being told?’ When the answer was no, they said it
could just as easily have been the CEO who did it.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, this opaque and secretive trading firm had been in
possession of the results, before anyone else in the world, of maybe the
most consequential presidential election in modern times, and they had
lost a fortune. In retrospect, they had spent too much time getting
their information and not enough time thinking about how to use it.
They’d just assumed that a Trump victory was a global financial
disaster. In retrospect, the trade they should have done was obvious (in
retrospect it always was): bet on the damage to small foreign markets
being greater than the damage to US markets. They should have bought the
SandandandandP 500 and sold bigger amounts of, say, the Mexican stock
market. “There was an extremely good trade in it that we fucked up,”
said Sam. “I thought the postmortem should be we almost nailed this.
Everything we put a lot of thought into we did quite well.”</p>
<p>Instead of trying to figure out how they might do such a trade better
the next time, Jane Street’s bosses decided they’d made a mistake by
trying to do such a trade at all. “It was, We have no intuition for
this, and we’re not going to do it, and we’re going to all not talk
about trading on elections for a while until this isn’t seared into our
memory.” This bothered Sam. It made him wonder if Jane Street was indeed
set up to maximize its expected value.</p>
<p>It was striking how few people left Jane Street for other Wall Street
firms, or really for anything else. “When a sort of senior person left
to go to a competitor, there was a crying and drinking session because
it was so traumatic,” said Sam. The firm enticed young people who at any
other time in human history were unlikely to have found their way to
Wall Street and kept them sufficiently interested and engaged and well
paid that they couldn’t imagine doing anything else with their lives
except trade for Jane Street. They turned math people into money people
without any obvious loss in human happiness. Even the employees who
weren’t all that good at their jobs were kept on and made to feel a part
of things. “Jane Street never fired people,” said Sam. “It was cheaper
to pay them to do nothing than to allow them to take trades to a
competitor.”</p>
<p>The firm had bent over backward to make Sam happy. They’d interviewed
the two closest friends Sam had made at MIT and hired one of them. They
even hired Sam’s younger brother, Gabe, who had just started on the Jane
Street trading floor. They’d allowed Sam to play a central role in
cooking up and pulling off a trade on the 2016 presidential election
that had lost the firm more money than any single trade in its history
without anyone saying even a mean word to him. In his annual reviews,
his bosses let him know that they had him ranked at the top of his Jane
Street class. He wasn’t the firm’s most profitable trader, but he was
still young, and doing very well. They’d paid him 00,000 after his first
year, 00,000 after his second year, and, after his third year, when he
was twenty-five years old, were about to hand him a bonus of million. In
his reviews, Sam pressed his bosses to paint a picture of his financial
future at Jane Street. It would depend, of course, on Jane Street’s
overall performance, they said, but ten years in, if he kept on doing as
well as he had been doing, he’d be making somewhere between 5 million
and 5 million a year. “Jane Street’s idea was to make people so happy
they wouldn’t leave,” said one former trader.</p>
<p>And yet Sam was not happy. His unhappiness was not a simple matter;
he was unhappy in so many ways that it would have helped him to create
new words for the emotion, the way the Inuit supposedly create all sorts
of words for ice. Every now and then, usually while he was taking a
shower, Sam’s thoughts about himself and his situation would coalesce,
and he would write them down. The tone of these private writings, in
which he was in effect presenting himself to himself, were wildly
different from the tone in which he presented himself to others. “I
don’t feel pleasure,” he wrote one day, late in his Jane Street career.
“I don’t feel happiness. Somehow my reward system never clicked. My
highest highs, my proudest moments, come and pass and I feel nothing but
the aching hole in my brain where happiness should be.” He knew he
should feel grateful to Jane Street for finding value in him that no one
else had, but he also knew that he didn’t. “To truly be thankful, you
have to have felt it in your heart, in your stomach, in your head—the
rush of pleasure, of kinship, of gratitude,” he wrote. “And I don’t feel
those things. But I don’t feel anything, or at least anything good. I
don’t feel pleasure, or love, or pride, or devotion. I feel the
awkwardness of the moment enclosing on me. The pressure to react
appropriately, to show that I love them back. And I don’t, because I
can’t.”</p>
<p>Jane Street was the only institution Sam had ever had anything to do
with that he did not feel at some level disapproving of. He was
surrounded all day by hundreds of people joined by a common purpose,
playing the best board game ever invented. And yet he still felt cut off
from other people. He’d learned to simulate responses to whatever other
people had just done or said, so that they might read him better. All
he’d really done was create a better mask, one that perhaps made it even
more difficult for others to know whatever was actually going on behind
it. “I enjoy my co-workers,” he wrote, “but they show no interest in
seeing who I really am, in hearing the thoughts I hold back. The more
honest I try to make our friendships, the more they fade away. No one is
curious. No one cares, not really, about the self I see. They care about
the Sam they see, and what he means to them. And they don’t seem to
understand who that Sam is—a product of thoughts that I decide people
should hear. My real-life twitter account.”</p>
<p>He thought of himself as a thinking machine rather than a feeling
one. He thought of himself as a person who thought his way to action.
About this, he wasn’t completely wrong. The big changes he made in his
life tended to come after some other person had made an argument to him
that he couldn’t refute. Days after his arrival at MIT, for example,
he’d met another freshman, Adam Yedidia—the friend whom Jane Street
eventually hired. They’d fallen into a conversation about
utilitarianism. Sam argued that it was life’s only sensible philosophy,
and that the main reason people didn’t see this was a fear of where it
would lead them. (“What scares people most about utilitarianism is that
it encourages selflessness.”) Adam had listened to Sam go on about his
beliefs until he finally said, If you really believed all that, you
wouldn’t eat meat. At little cost to yourself you reduce a lot of
suffering. Sam was serious about minimizing suffering. Sam also liked
his fried chicken—but that wasn’t really an argument. “Whatever he said
had been rattling around in my head, but I had been avoiding it because
of a thought I did not want to have,” said Sam. “The thought was: I
spend thirty minutes enjoying chicken and the chicken endures five weeks
of torture.” There was nothing to do but overhaul his diet, and he did.
“There are easy vegetarians and there are hard ones, and he was a hard
one,” said Adam. “It’s unusual to change something like that when it’s
difficult.”</p>
<p>A similar thing had happened to Sam when he’d met Will MacAskill. The
Oxford philosopher’s argument struck Sam as simply right. He’d long ago
already decided that a person should judge his life by its consequences.
MacAskill had made those consequences both dramatic and quantifiable: he
should maximize the number of lives he saved. Sam had bought in,
instantly. “It was very fast and matter of fact,” said Sam. “What he
said sort of seemed obviously right to me. It gave me a practical course
of action: There are actual things to do. I can do this. There are
people that do this.” Three years into his career at Jane Street, he
remained fully committed to generating as many dollars as possible and
channeling them into the causes that saved lives most efficiently. He’d
given away most of the money he’d made on the trading floor to three
charities identified by the Oxford philosophers as being especially
efficient at saving lives. (Two of those charities, 80,000 Hours and the
Centre for Effective Altruism, the Oxford philosophers had started
themselves. The third was the Humane League.)</p>
<p>And yet somehow Sam had committed his life to maximizing happiness on
earth without feeling any of his own. Between the summer of 2014, when
he started at Jane Street, and the summer of 2017, he’d taken no
vacation. He’d actually worked ten days when US markets were closed—the
action in foreign markets was especially great when US traders weren’t
paying attention—and so on the Jane Street books he had taken negative
vacation days. On the trading floor, he’d found himself asking himself a
question: What is the likelihood that this job I stumbled into by
accident yields my highest value? He thought it implausible on the face
of it. He’d even made a list of things he might do other than trade for
Jane Street: work in politics, write journalism, sell other people on
becoming effective altruists, start some random tech company (even
though I don’t have an idea for one), set out to trade on my own. “There
were like ten of these things,” recalled Sam. “I tried to estimate the
expected value of each, and they were all very similar. A choice between
Jane Street and any of them was a close call, but a choice between Jane
Street and all of them is not. I was asking, What is the likelihood that
Jane Street is the best option? Low. But it was pretty clear that I
wasn’t going to figure it out at Jane Street. The only way to figure it
out was to fuck around and try some of these things.”</p>
<p>Late in the summer of 2017, he finally took a vacation. Once he was
free to experiment, it took him little time to see that one of the
options on his list was not like the others. In 2017, cryptocurrency had
gone from being this bizarre hobbyhorse in which he had zero interest to
a semi-serious financial market, entirely separate from other financial
markets. That year alone, the value of all crypto boomed, going from 5
billion to 60 billion. Jane Street didn’t trade crypto. Neither, so far
as Sam could see, did any of the other high-frequency trading firms.
Jane Street was so skittish about crypto that it wouldn’t even allow its
traders to trade it in their personal accounts. (Sam had asked.) Yet
each day roughly a billion dollars’ worth of crypto traded, in such
primitive fashion that you’d have thought high-frequency trading had
never been invented.</p>
<p>Sam did a back-of-the-envelope calculation: if he could capture 5
percent of the entire market (a modest number, by Jane Street
standards), he could make a million dollars a day or more. As the market
never closed, that meant profits of 65 million a year or more. “That was
my ballpark estimate,” he said. “It seemed crazy. So I just cut it by a
factor of ten. I was thinking thirty million a year. But I felt
embarrassed showing that number to anyone else. They’d say, ‘Fuck off,
Sam.’”</p>
<p>He didn’t feel all that embarrassed, however. Before he returned to
Jane Street to quit his job, he spoke to his college friend who had
provoked him into giving up meat. “Sam was unlike anyone else, in that
when he stated his opinion he did it with exactly his level of
confidence, which is often very high,” recalled Adam Yedidia. “Before he
left Jane Street, he said with a high level of confidence, ‘I could make
a billion dollars.’ And I said, ‘You’re not going to make a billion
dollars.’”</p>
