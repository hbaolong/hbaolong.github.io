<h4 id="how-to-think-about-bob">5 How to Think about Bob</h4>
<p>It took only a couple of weeks of working for Sam before Caroline
Ellison called her mother and sobbed into the phone that she’d just made
the biggest mistake of her life. She’d first met Sam at Jane Street, in
the summer before her senior year at Stanford, after he’d been assigned
to teach her class of interns how to trade. “I was kind of, like,
terrified of him,” she said. Like Sam, she was the child of
academics—her father, Glenn Ellison, had been the head of MIT’s
Department of Economics. Like Sam, she was someone for whom math had
played an important role early on—she’d first heard of Jane Street from
the math competitions that the firm sponsored to meet young people just
like her. Like Sam, she had discovered effective altruism in college,
and found in it an intellectually coherent sense of purpose. Maybe even
more than Sam, she had allowed math to pull her to a moral place. “I was
attracted to people thinking about what to do in a quantitative,
rigorous way,” she said. “Before that, I don’t think I had much of an
impulse to do good in the world.”</p>
<p>And like Sam, she’d been hired by Jane Street as a full-time trader.
But unlike Sam, she was unsure of herself and susceptible to being
swayed by the opinions of others, especially men with whom she was
involved. Unlike Sam, she wanted a normal life, with emotions and
children and maybe even a sport utility vehicle in which to drive them
around. After a year at Jane Street, she sensed that she was at best
average at her job and in any case didn’t have anything like Sam’s
feeling for the place, or share his fanaticism about work. “I did feel a
bit, like, unsatisfied,” she said. “There was something missing. I
wasn’t sure I was doing that much good.” At the same time, she’d formed
an unsettling attachment, at once full of promise and absent of hope, to
another Jane Street trader, Eric Mannes. “Looking back on my
relationship with Eric Mannes really makes me cringe,” she wrote later,
in an attempt to explain her emotional journey, which, because she was
writing to Sam’s attention span, she reduced to bullet points:</p>
<p>he told me that he would probably never love me</p>
<p>this made me feel really sad and really bad about myself</p>
<p>I didn’t want him to know how bad it made me feel, since I was
worried it would cause him to break up with me</p>
<p>so instead I hid my feelings and tried to act cheerful and chill
about everything</p>
<p>I tried to avoid talking or thinking about things that made me feel
bad</p>
<p>eg hearing about his exes made me feel jealous and insecure, so I
never asked about them</p>
<p>“With Eric I had a feeling that if he really knew me deeply, he
wouldn’t want to be with me, and thus I needed to hide myself,” she
added.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2017, she’d been sent by Jane Street back to Stanford,
to recruit to high-frequency trading the mathematically gifted friends
she’d left behind. Upon arrival she’d called Sam and asked him to meet.
Over coffee in Berkeley,fn1 Sam was cagey about what he was up to. “It
was, ‘I’m working on something secret and I can’t talk about it,’”
recalled Caroline. “He was worried about recruiting from Jane Street.
But after we talked a while, he said, ‘I guess maybe I could tell you.’”
By the end of their chat, Caroline thought that maybe she should quit
Jane Street and join the crypto trading firm Sam was secretly building.
The work felt familiar: she’d be doing the same sort of research in
crypto for Sam’s new quant fund that she was doing in equities for Jane
Street. Asking questions like: Does the price of bitcoin vary
significantly with time of day? Or: How does the price of bitcoin move
in relation to the prices of all the other coins? But the underlying
purpose of the work would be entirely different, because she would be
doing it only with other effective altruists. Jane Street, as Sam put
it, was “just a place where people come to work each day to play some
games and increase the number in their bank account, because what the
fuck else are they going to do with their lives?” Alameda Research, as
he was calling the new firm, was going to be different: a vessel to save
some vast number of lives.</p>
<p>Caroline told Sam that she’d need to think about it. Thinking about
it meant returning to Jane Street and asking Eric Mannes one final time
if he loved her. As it turned out, Eric Mannes did not love her—which,
though sad in its way, freed up Caroline to quit Jane Street and join
Alameda Research.</p>
<p>Quitting Jane Street wasn’t as painless as Caroline thought it would
be. First-year traders whom Jane Street had just paid 00,000 didn’t
simply up and quit—especially not to go work for a fly-by-night crypto
trading start-up. Caroline sensed, rightly, that her departure alerted
Jane Street to an alarming new threat. Jane Street and the other
high-frequency trading firms had been fishing for traders in the same
ponds as Will MacAskill and the other Oxford philosophers fished for
effective altruists. People able to calculate the expected value of
complicated financial gambles were the same people drawn to the belief
that they could calculate the expected value of their entire lives. By
Wall Street standards, Jane Street was not a greedy place. Its
principals did not flaunt their wealth in the way that the guys who had
founded other high-frequency trading firms loved to do. They didn’t buy
pro sports teams or hurl money at Ivy League schools to get buildings
named for themselves. They were not opposed to saving a few lives. But
Jane Street was still on Wall Street. To survive, it needed its
employees to grow attached to their annual bonuses, and accustomed to
their five-bedroom Manhattan apartments and quiet, understated summer
houses in the Hamptons.</p>
<p>The flood of effective altruists into the firm was worrisome. These
people arrived with their own value system. They had their own deep
loyalties to something other than Jane Street. They didn’t have the
usual Wall Street person’s relationship to money; they didn’t care about
their bonuses in the ways Wall Street people were supposed to care. Sam
Bankman-Fried had been able to leave his lucrative Jane Street job for a
nutso plan to try to make even more money on his own because he had no
material attachments. “It wasn’t going to cut into his lifestyle,
because he didn’t have a lifestyle,” as one former Jane Street trader
put it.</p>
<p>Caroline was the second effective altruist to quit Jane Street’s New
York office in a matter of months, by telling them, on her way out the
door, that she was leaving to maximize her expected value. This time
they were ready for it. Her manager, a Jane Street partner, pulled her
into his office. “He was pissed off,” she said. “Just cold.” He then
proceeded to challenge her deepest beliefs. Effective altruism made no
sense, he said, then laid out the many senseless things about it: there
was no accurate way to measure the consequences in the distant future of
your present actions; if such measurement did exist, it would likely be
done best by the market; no one would pay you as much as Jane Street
paid you, ergo, your highest value was at Jane Street. And so on. This
was a first: a Wall Street trading firm whose business was premised on
its ability to hire the brightest mathematical minds was now compelled
to make arguments about the limits of math in life. “It was this
hour-long conversation with the partner where he tried to convince me to
stay because utilitarianism was flawed,” recalled Caroline. “I thought,
This isn’t something we’re going to solve in an hour.”</p>
<p>She was surprised by the Jane Street partner’s lack of sentiment
after his argument hadn’t landed as he imagined it might. “Once he saw I
wasn’t going to change my mind about utilitarianism, my stuff is in a
box,” she said. No one on the trading floor offered her so much as a
hug. With her box of stuff, Caroline Ellison walked out onto the streets
of lower Manhattan. Once there and on her own, her first thought was:
God, I’ve made a huge mistake.</p>
<p>But the thought passed. And in March of 2018 she moved to the Bay
Area and took some time for herself before reporting to her new job. On
her blog she described her feelings of liberation.</p>
<p>me after living in the Bay Area for a week: monogamy is hopeless and
dying. might as well be a plate for alpha guys while I’m still young/hot
enough and freeze my eggs for later</p>
<p>In late March she started the job. The situation inside Alameda
Research wasn’t anything like Sam had led her to expect. He’d recruited
twenty or so EAs, most of them in their twenties, all but one without
experience trading in financial markets. Most neither knew nor cared
about crypto; they had just bought into Sam’s argument that it was this
insanely inefficient market in which they might use his Jane Street–like
approach to trading to extract billions. They were now all living in
Sam’s world, and they weren’t hiding their unhappiness. “He was
demanding and expecting everyone to work eighteen-hour days and give up
anything like a normal life, while he would not show up for meetings,
not shower for weeks, have a mess all around him with old food
everywhere, and fall asleep at his desk,” said Tara Mac Aulay, a young
Australian mathematician who was, in theory, running the company with
Sam. “He did zero management and thought that if people had any
questions, they should just ask him. Then in his one-on-ones with
people, he’d play video games.”</p>
<p>The firm’s finances were already in a state of chaos. They’d started
small a few months before, with the half million left over after taxes
from Sam’s Jane Street bonus, but within a few months they’d persuaded
other, richer effective altruists to lend them 70 million to trade
crypto. They’d lost millions of it already, though how many millions no
one could say for sure. In February their trading system had lost half a
million dollars per day. On top of the trading losses, some additional
millions had simply vanished. No one seemed to know where the money had
gone—but the employees were in full panic mode. “It’s not that virtually
the entire management team wanted to leave,” said Ben West, one of its
five members. “The entire management team wanted to leave.” The four
others held a series of increasingly tense meetings with Sam. In the
first of these, Ben asked Sam what his ideal role was in the company.
“He says that it was being the nerve center—the spider in the center of
the web,” recalled Ben. “That people would come to him with ideas and he
would decide if they were good or not.” Sam saw his job as listening to
what others had to say, and yet the members of the management team,
along with pretty much everyone else in the new company, felt that he
wouldn’t listen to a word they said.</p>
<p>Amid the turmoil, Sam inhabited what amounted to his own reality. His
attitude toward the missing money was, Eh, it’ll probably turn up
somewhere. So let’s fucking trade! His first stab at an automated
trading system was losing money at an alarming clip, but he’d created
another, supposedly better one. Modelbot, it was called. Modelbot had
been programmed to scour the world’s crypto exchanges for inefficiencies
to exploit. If for even a few seconds it was possible to buy bitcoin on
some Singaporean exchange for ,900 and sell it for ,920 on an exchange
in Japan, Modelbot would do it over and over again, thousands of times
per second. But that example made Modelbot sound simpler than it was.
Modelbot was programmed to trade roughly five hundred different crypto
coins on thirty or so different crypto exchanges, most of them in Asia,
all of them basically unregulated. The tulip-bulb-like explosion in
crypto over the previous year had encouraged the creation of hundreds of
new coins. Modelbot made no distinction between the better-known coins
with deep markets, like bitcoin and ether, the Ethereum blockchain’s
token, and the so-called shitcoins that hardly traded at all, like
Sexcoin and PUTinCoin and Hot Potato Coin.fn2 Modelbot just hunted for
any coin it could buy at one price in one place and sell in another at a
higher price.</p>
<p>Modelbot was maybe the biggest point of disagreement between Sam and
his management team. Sam’s Release-the-Kraken fantasy was to hit a
button and let Modelbot burn and churn through crypto markets
twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. He had not been able to let
Modelbot rip the way he’d liked—because just about every other human
being inside Alameda Research was doing whatever they could to stop him.
“It was entirely within the realm of possibility that we could lose all
our money in an hour,” said one. One hundred seventy million dollars
that might otherwise go to effective altruism could simply go poof. That
thought terrified the other four effective altruists in charge of
Alameda Research. One evening, Tara argued heatedly with Sam until he
caved and agreed to what she thought was a reasonable compromise: he
could turn on Modelbot so long as he and at least one other person were
present to watch it, but should turn it off if it started losing money.
“I said, ‘Okay, I’m going home and go to sleep,’ and as soon as I left,
Sam turned it on and fell asleep,” recalled Tara. From that moment the
entire management team gave up on ever trusting Sam.</p>
<p>Once she’d started, Caroline heard the gory details from Sam’s
disaffected partners. “They told me, ‘You should know for your own good
that there are problems here,’” she later recalled. At the end of
Caroline’s second week, they called a meeting to announce that they had
persuaded the rich effective altruists who had lent them the 70 million
to demand its return—which meant that in a few weeks Alameda Research
would have no money to trade with. Caroline did not know whom to
believe. She felt deceived that Sam had not warned her of how poorly
Alameda Research was doing before she quit her job at Jane Street. And
yet she didn’t know any of these other people. She thought she knew Sam,
but she also thought that if the entire management was talking about
quitting in protest, and the investors were taking their money back,
someone must know things about Sam that she did not. It was at this
point that Caroline called her mother and cried.</p>
<p>The business hadn’t even really been Sam’s idea but Tara’s. Tara had
been running the Centre for Effective Altruism, in Berkeley, and Sam,
while at Jane Street, had become one of her biggest donors. Through the
spring and summer of 2017, the two of them were on the phone constantly.
At some point Sam revealed his romantic interest in her; at some other
point Tara revealed that she was trading crypto in her personal account.
Tara was no one’s idea of a crypto trader—before moving to run the
Centre for Effective Altruism, she’d modeled pharmaceutical demand for
the Red Cross. She had no financial background and no money to speak of
and yet was generating tens of thousands in profits trading crypto. The
more Sam spoke with Tara, the more his interest drifted from her
romantic appeal to her trading skills. Tara wasn’t just buying bitcoin
and watching it rise. She was exploiting the same sorts of
inefficiencies in the market for cryptocurrencies that, to exploit in
other financial markets, required Jane Street–level talent and speed and
expertise.</p>
<p>Sam wrote her a check for 0,000 and sent it to her, no strings
attached, so she might increase the size of her bets. She never cashed
it. The money made her uneasy—and not because it had come from Sam. “I
kept saying, ‘What if I just got really lucky?’” recalled Tara. Sam
finally put her mind to rest with some math that showed how
statistically improbable it was that her rate of success was just luck.
Tara’s trades were sort of like the trades Jane Street did on everything
else, bets on the relative values of different crypto coins. Her success
led Sam to his secret belief that he might make a billion dollars by
creating a hedge fund to trade crypto the way Jane Street traded
everything.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t do it by himself. Crypto trading never closed. Just
to have two people awake twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week,
he’d need to hire at least five other traders. He’d also need
programmers to turn the traders’ insights into code, so that their
trading could be automated and speeded up. Tara had been making a
handful of trades a week on her laptop; what Sam had in mind was an army
of bots making a million trades a day. He’d need to hire some lower-IQ
people to do the boring stuff, like finding office space and getting
food for the traders and paying utility bills and probably lots of other
things he hadn’t thought of.</p>
<p>His access to a pool of willing effective altruists was his secret
weapon. Sam knew next to nothing about crypto, but he did know how easy
it was to steal it. Anyone who started a crypto trading firm would need
to trust his employees deeply, as any employee could hit a button and
wire the crypto to a personal account without anyone else ever having
the first idea what had happened. Wall Street firms were not capable of
generating that level of trust, but EA was.</p>
<p>Up to that point in his life, Sam hadn’t led much of anything or even
been vaguely responsible for other people. He’d managed puzzle hunts out
of his parents’ home in high school. He’d spent a year as “Commander” of
a twenty-five-person living group at MIT. It crossed his mind, now that
he was starting his own business, that he should read up on how to
manage people. But every time he flipped through books or articles on
management or leadership, he had roughly the same reaction he’d had to
English class. One expert said X, the other said the opposite of X. “It
was all bullshit,” he said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he had a nose for talent. His judgment of other
people was always far more acute than their judgment of him. His first
call, made even before he left Jane Street, was to Gary Wang. Sam had
met Gary at math camp in high school but hadn’t really gotten to know
him until college. Born in China but raised mainly in the United States,
he was a year behind Sam at MIT and had lived in the same nerd house.
Even there he stood out: among shy, socially awkward introverts, Gary
was always the most shy, the most socially awkward, and the most
introverted. He had this clear, untroubled face and the smile of an
angel but … no words. People who worked side by side with him for months
would come away convinced that he simply didn’t speak. Some found his
silences rude, but they were mistaken. They were inevitable. In response
to the attempts of others to engage him, the best he could manage was an
apologetic smile. Otherwise, he kept his back to the world and his eyes
fixed on his computer screen.</p>
<p>With Sam for some reason he made an exception. Sam had watched Gary
win coding competitions at MIT and listened to people who knew a lot
more about coding than he did talk about Gary’s coding genius. Sam had
also played board games with Gary, endlessly. Board games turned out to
be maybe the only way to get to know Gary. “I ultimately saw him for
what he was and didn’t just dismiss him, and a lot of people did just
dismiss him,” said Sam. “Despite being very quiet, he seemed not
terribly scared of the world. He was very smart. He was good at games,
so he could work on things that were not super literal.”</p>
<p>After a while, when it was just the two of them, Gary spoke to Sam.
Whatever had come out of Gary’s mouth had impressed Sam enough that he’d
tried to get Jane Street to hire him. Gary had flubbed the interviews,
however, by not speaking. Following graduation from MIT, he’d stayed in
Boston, working as a programmer for Google Flights. During his final
weeks at Jane Street, Sam traveled to Boston just to tell Gary about his
plan to make a billion dollars trading crypto for effective altruistic
causes. (Sam had converted Gary to effective altruism.) “He was bored as
shit at Google Flights,” said Sam. “After a few hours he says he’s
probably in.” Sam then called Tara and told her that he’d found their
chief technology officer, and that she needed to talk to Gary. Tara
called Gary and … well, it was a strange experience. It was tricky
getting through a phone call with someone who didn’t speak. Tara told
Sam as much, and Sam said, You’re just, like, missing something. Wait
until you meet him in person.</p>
<p>That happened in October 2017, when Sam and Tara and Gary gathered in
a house in Berkeley and used Sam’s Jane Street bonus to make their first
trades—with Sam doing all the talking. By then word was spreading
through the growing community of effective altruists of this strange new
adventure in altruistic moneymaking. All sorts of people with no
experience of trading, and no particular interest in money, began to
turn up and offer their services. Among the first was another person who
would wind up with a central role in Sam’s world: Nishad Singh.</p>
<p>Nishad was twenty-one years old and newly graduated from the
University of California at Berkeley. He was also Sam’s younger
brother’s best friend from high school. As classmates at Crystal Springs
Uplands, Gabe and Nishad had gone vegan together, and then, in college,
they had become effective altruists. After college, Nishad had taken the
EA path sold far and wide by Will MacAskill and found the highest-paying
job he could, so that he might donate his earnings to causes that saved
lives. He’d been on a starting salary of 00,000 a year at Facebook when,
after only five months, he’d lost his stomach for the work. “There was
just some truly retarded stuff,” he said. Word reached him that Sam
Bankman-Fried had quit Jane Street to generate even more money for
effective altruism, and Nishad was all ears. He called Sam and asked
what he was doing. “I show up at their apartment,” recalled Nishad.
“It’s just Sam and Gary and Tara. They show me this thing. Sam was like,
Watch me make these trades. He makes a few clicks and says, I just made
forty thousand dollars. I was like, ‘Holy shit! This is real?’”</p>
<p>Like Gary, Nishad was the child of immigrants. His parents had come
to Silicon Valley from India with little, turned themselves into
upper-middle-class Americans, and never stopped charging forward. It
bothered Nishad when they went back to India on a visit and ignored the
people starving on the side of the road, and he let them know it. It
bothered Nishad even more when he learned how animals were treated on
their way to becoming his family’s dinner, and he let them know that,
too. “You’re not jaded as a kid. You can feel how horrific it is.
There’s not much you can control as a kid, but I could control this.” By
high school he was reading Peter Singer and on a moral journey that his
parents regarded as faintly ridiculous. “My parents’ attitude was, No
one cares about this stuff; that must mean there is nothing to care
about. The truth is, I stopped talking about it, because they’d just
leave the dinner table.” They’d been especially bewildered by their
son’s turn toward effective altruism in college. “They thought giving
away things is insane,” said Nishad.</p>
<p>Maybe for this reason, Gabe’s parents, Joe and Barbara, had become
important to Nishad. “They were the first grown-ups who took me
seriously,” he said. “And it made me take myself seriously.” Gabe’s
older brother, on the other hand, might as well have not existed. In
high school, Sam didn’t seem to have much to do with Gabe or anyone
else; he seldom even emerged from his bedroom. “I just thought of Sam as
a reclusive genius,” said Nishad. “It’s like he doesn’t belong in
childhood.”</p>
<p>Face-to-face as a young adult with the reclusive genius, Nishad now
had some questions. The first was: How the hell did the crypto market
let you just take forty thousand dollars out of it? Sam explained how
Jane Street made money, and added that the crypto markets were dominated
by retail traders who didn’t pay much attention to price discrepancies
from one crypto exchange to the next. To which Nishad responded: Why is
it not the case that Jane Street or some other high-frequency trading
firm will come along and take over the crypto markets? Sam explained
that Jane Street—and likely others—were waking up to crypto, but that it
would take them months to ease their concerns that it wasn’t all one
vast criminal enterprise. I’m an engineer, Nishad said. I don’t even
know the difference between a stock and a bond: How could I possibly be
of use? Don’t worry, said Sam, it doesn’t matter that you’ve never
traded. It’s just another engineering problem, and once you acquire even
a little knowledge, you’ll be able to help code the trading system.</p>
<p>Then what are the risks? asked Nishad.</p>
<p>That we blow up, said Sam.</p>
<p>They didn’t blow up, not at first. Those first few weeks, they made
no real money, but then they had only a few people and Sam’s bonus
money. By the end of December, they’d hired a bunch of people and raised
5 million in capital. Gary, basically all by himself, had written the
code for an entire quantitative system. That month they generated
several million dollars in profits. In January 2018 their profits rose
to half a million dollars each day, on a capital base of 0
million—whereupon an effective altruist named Jaan Tallinn, who’d made
his fortune in Skype, handed them 30 million more to play with.</p>
<p>The trading from the start was chaotic. Much of the money they made
in their first two months came from just two trades. The frenzied demand
for bitcoin created weird distortions in global crypto markets. By
December 2017, retail speculators in South Korea were driving bitcoin to
prices 20 percent higher than they were on US exchanges, sometimes more.
Anyone who could find a way to sell crypto in South Korea and at the
same time buy it outside of South Korea could lock in vast profits. It
wasn’t trivial to do, however. To open a crypto account on a South
Korean exchange, just for starters, you needed to be South Korean. “We
found a graduate student friend in South Korea and traded in his name,”
recalled Nishad, who now saw why maybe it would take Jane Street a while
to export radical efficiency to crypto markets. Jane Street would smell
legal trouble; Jane Street would at the very least be embarrassed if it
wound up as news in the New York Times that they’d hired a South Korean
grad student to front their business. “It was borderline illegal, but in
practice, who goes after you when you do this?” said Nishad later. “No
one.” This was the very beginning of Nishad’s financial education: there
were laws that, in theory, governed money; and then there was what
people actually did with money. “That’s where I learned what the law
is,” said Nishad. “The law is what happens, not what is written.”</p>
<p>Pretending to be South Korean was the easy part. It was illegal for
South Koreans to sell more than ten grand worth of won without the
permission of the central bank. Even if you could find a South Korean
grad student to front your trades, you still had to find a way to turn
won into dollars. Otherwise, you ended up with a bunch of won in South
Korea (from the bitcoin you sold on the South Korean exchange) and a
bunch of bitcoin you’d bought on some US crypto exchange. You couldn’t
complete the trade. Ideally, all at once, you’d sell the bitcoin in
South Korea for won, then sell the won for dollars, use those dollars to
buy the bitcoin (at a 20 percent discount) in the United Sates, and ship
that bitcoin back to South Korea, leaving you with no bitcoin and a 20
percent profit on the trade. But the South Korean government wouldn’t
let you sell the won.</p>
<p>It wasn’t Sam’s first thought, but he considered buying a jumbo jet
and flying it back and forth from Seoul, filled with South Koreans
carrying suitcases each holding 0,000 worth of won, to a small island
off the coast of Japan. “The problem is that it wasn’t scalable,” said
Sam. “To make it worthwhile, we needed like ten thousand South Koreans a
day. And we probably would have attracted so much attention doing it
that we would have been shut down. Once the South Korean central bank
saw you with ten thousand South Koreans carrying suitcases full of won
they’d be like, There’s going to be a new direction here.”</p>
<p>Still, he was tempted. There were moments when the price of bitcoin
in South Korea was 50 percent higher than the price of bitcoin in the
United States. At that point you didn’t even need currencies. All you
needed was to buy a huge amount of something with the won that you could
then sell outside of South Korea for a huge number of dollars. Briefly,
Sam considered creating an import-export company for Tylenol. Buy the
pills with won in South Korea, and sell them for dollars in the United
States.</p>
<p>Sam and his fellow effective altruists had a dozen ideas like this
before they settled on Ripple. RippleNet was a platform created by some
crypto entrepreneurs back in 2012 that was making a pitch to play the
useful role in everyday financial life that Bitcoin had been meant to
play. A big part of the theoretical appeal of Ripple’s coin, XRP, was
that, unlike bitcoin, which took vast amounts of energy to maintain, it
was carbon-neutral. Ripple’s actual appeal was the same as Bitcoin’s:
the price of its coin moved up and down a lot, and so it was fun to
gamble on. By late 2017, lots of people traded XRP on every major crypto
exchange. On South Korean exchanges, XRP was trading at an even greater
premium to XRP on American exchanges than South Korean bitcoin was to
American bitcoin.</p>
<p>If a bitcoin cost 20 percent more in South Korea than it did in the
US, Ripple’s coin cost 25 percent more. Ripple offered a path to exploit
the insanity of the South Korean crypto markets: sell XRP in South
Korea, use the won to buy bitcoin, ship the bitcoin to the US, where you
could sell it for dollars, and use the dollars to buy XRP, which you
could then send back to South Korea. The bitcoin still cost 20 percent
more in South Korea than it did in the United States, but the 25 percent
gains from Ripple’s tokens more than paid for that. The 20 percent you
might have made on each trade shrank to 5 percent, but the profits were
still outrageous, even by, say, Jane Street standards. The only risk was
the five to thirty seconds it took to make the trades.</p>
<p>Or at least that’s how it seemed when Alameda first made the trade.
Then one day in February, someone—not Sam, who was frantically
trading—noticed the missing Ripple. Four million dollars’ worth of it
had vanished. In fairness, it was not then clear whether it was gone
forever. Sam and his traders, using the system Gary had built, were
making a quarter of a million trades each day. So much Ripple and
Bitcoin was flying around at any given time that it was at least
possible that any missing Ripple was simply in transit. Sam suspected
that the million worth of Ripple had been sent from the exchange in the
United States (and debited from Alameda’s account) and had arrived at
the exchange in South Korea, but that the South Korean exchange was just
dragging its feet in crediting it to Alameda’s account. The other
members of the management team were unconvinced. They insisted that Sam
stop trading so that they could figure out where their Ripple had
gone.</p>
<p>At length Sam agreed. He stopped trading for two weeks. The other
members of the management team confirmed that millions of dollars’ worth
of Ripple was indeed missing. At which point everyone except Sam, and
perhaps Gary, became upset. “We thought we needed to tell investors and
tell employees so they could reconsider their options, but Sam hated
that idea,” said one of the firm’s managers. Sam continued to insist
that the missing Ripple was no big deal. He didn’t think anyone had
stolen it. He didn’t actually believe that it was lost, or that they
should account for it as lost. He told his fellow managers that in his
estimation there was an 80 percent chance that it would eventually turn
up. Thus they should count themselves as still having 80 percent of it.
To which one of his fellow managers replied: After the fact, if we never
get any of the Ripple back, no one is going to say it is reasonable for
us to have said we have eighty percent of the Ripple. Everyone is just
going to say we lied to them. We’ll be accused by our investors of
fraud.</p>
<p>That sort of argument just bugged the hell out of Sam. He hated the
way inherently probabilistic situations would be interpreted, after the
fact, as having been black-and-white, or good and bad, or right and
wrong. So much of what made his approach to life different from most
people’s was his willingness to assign probabilities and act on them,
and his refusal to be swayed by any after-the-fact illusion that the
world had been more knowable than it actually was. The missing Ripple
reminded him of a favorite thought experiment. “You have a close friend,
Bob,” he explained. “He’s great. You love him. Bob is at a house party
where someone gets murdered. No one knows who the murderer is. There are
twenty people there. None are criminals. But Bob is less likely in your
mind than anyone else to have killed someone. But you can’t say that
there is a zero chance Bob killed someone. Someone got killed, no one
knows who did it. You now think there’s like a one percent chance Bob
did it. How do you see Bob now? What is Bob to you? And there is no
updating: there is no new information about Bob.”</p>
<p>One answer was that you should never go near Bob again. There might
be a 99 percent chance that Bob is the saint you always thought him to
be, but if you’re wrong, you’re dead. Treating Bob’s character as a
matter of probability felt problematic. Bob was either a cold-blooded
killer or he wasn’t. Whatever probability you assigned before you found
out the truth about Bob would appear, after the fact, unfair and even
absurd. “There doesn’t exist a guess you can make that is overwhelmingly
likely to be roughly correct,” said Sam. “Bob is either completely
blameless or far more guilty.” And yet assigning a probability to Bob’s
character was, in Sam’s view, the only way to think about him, or indeed
any uncertain situation. “It’s not good enough to say, ‘Bob’s not the
kind of guy I want to be around.’ So what is the probability at which
you say, ‘Okay, I’m going to just stay away from Bob until this is
resolved’?” said Sam. “It’s sort of mind-bending. There is no way to
deal with Bob right now that is just.” Life’s uncertainties often made a
mockery of a probabilistic approach, but in Sam’s view there was really
no other approach to take. “A lot of things are like Bob,” said Sam. “I
thought that the Ripple was like Bob. We’d either get it back or
not.”</p>
<p>By early April, the other executives at Alameda Research had ceased
to be interested in Sam’s thought experiments. “After the trading pause,
I expected Sam to update and he didn’t update,” said one. “Like, Hey, we
have a big problem. We don’t know where the money is. But we know we
don’t have as much as we thought we did.” They’d all wearied of Sam’s
stubborn unwillingness to manage anyone. They’d all grown to fear how
little he worried about where exactly their money was. They were making
two hundred fifty thousand trades a day and their system had somehow
lost, or failed to record, some large number of them. Among the many
problems their shoddy recordkeeping caused was the difficulty of filing
an honest tax return. “How are we going to pass an audit if we’re
missing ten percent of our transactions?” asked Tara. The missing Ripple
was the final straw. “The prospect of losing a couple of hundred million
dollars that would have otherwise gone into solving the world’s problems
felt pretty high stakes,” said Ben West. Under the circumstances, they
thought it was insane to continue trading, but Sam insisted on trading.
Crypto markets would not remain inefficient for long. They needed to
make hay while the sun shone.</p>
<p>The sun unfortunately took that moment to hide behind the clouds.
After crypto prices tanked in February, the Asian frenzy subsided and
the gaps in crypto prices between Asian and US exchanges vanished. At
the same time the Ripple went missing, the trading profits turned into
trading losses. In January they’d made half a million dollars of profits
a day trading 0 million in capital; in February, with four times as much
capital, they’d lost half a million dollars a day. Apart from a shared
alarm at his recklessness, the members of the management team were not
perfectly unified in their opinions of Sam. Tara had long since decided
that he was dishonest and manipulative. Ben still thought him
well-intentioned—but terrible at his job. But all felt themselves on a
suicide mission. “I had a conversation with Tara and Peter [McIntyre,
another executive],” recalled Ben, “and we were talking about how to
help Sam and the conversation changed to: How do we get rid of Sam?”</p>
<p>Like everything else about Alameda Research, this bid by the firm’s
other managers to get rid of Sam proved complicated. For a start, Sam
owned the entire company. He’d structured it so that no one else had
equity, only promises of equity down the road. In a tense meeting, the
others offered to buy him out, but at a fraction of what Sam thought the
firm to be worth, and the offer came with diabolical fine print: Sam
would remain liable for all taxes on any future Alameda profits. At
least some of his fellow effective altruists aimed to bankrupt Sam,
almost as a service to humanity, so that he might never be allowed to
trade again. “He seemed to feel very sorry for himself,” Ben wrote of
Sam after the meeting. “I reminded him that everyone else at the company
has sacrificed a huge amount.”</p>
<p>Enter Nishad. In his treatment of others, Nishad was almost painfully
considerate—the sort of person who, after he offers up an opinion,
qualifies it four different ways to make sure he hasn’t caused offense.
He could see merit in both sides of any argument. And, young as he was,
he now drifted into the uneasy role of human buffer between Sam and
people who perhaps did not fully understand Sam—basically everyone
except Gary. “I think it was because I prioritize the person over the
work and Sam is exactly the opposite of that,” said Nishad. “In spite of
being emotionally inattentive, I’m much more emotionally attentive than
Sam.” Nishad would have been the first to admit at that moment that he
knew nothing about how to manage people—especially people so fixated on
their careers as tools for maximizing the expected value of their lives.
“I tried to think about how to role-play a good manager,” he said. “I
thought it would involve like maybe a one-on-one meeting every week to
check on their feelings, and giving good feedback and some other things
like that. And Sam didn’t meet any of those criteria. People kept
complaining about that thing where he is looking at his computer while
he’s talking to you and giving you half answers. And he’s resistant to
the idea that someone is going to tell him something he doesn’t
know.”</p>
<p>As the dispute between Sam and the other higher-ups turned ugly,
Nishad was dragged in to mediate. “I basically agreed that Sam was a
very bad manager. He was genuinely a terrible manager.” But while Sam
was sullen and withdrawn, the other members of the management team, in
Nishad’s view, were excessively outraged. “The conversations we had were
absolutely fucking nuts,” he recalled. “Like to what extent Sam should
be excommunicated for deceiving EAs and wasting EA talent. And like ‘the
only way Sam will learn is if he actually goes bankrupt.’ They told our
investors he was faking being an EA, because it was the meanest thing
they could think to say.” Ruining Sam wasn’t enough, however: they
expected to be paid on their way out the door. “They wanted severance,
even though they were quitting and it was a money-losing operation in
which they didn’t have a stake,” said Nishad. “They were saying that Sam
needed to buy them out and they were worth more than one hundred percent
of the value of the entire company because Sam was a net negative.”</p>
<p>It occurred to Nishad that the effective altruist’s relationship to
money was more than a little bizarre. Basically all of Alameda
Research’s employees and investors were committed to giving all their
money away to roughly the same charitable causes. You might surmise that
they wouldn’t much care who wound up with the money, as it all would go
to saving the lives of the same people none of them would ever meet. You
would be wrong: in their financial dealings with each other, the
effective altruists were more ruthless than Russian oligarchs. Their
investors were charging them a rate of interest of 50 percent. “It
wasn’t a normal loan,” said Nishad. “It was a shark loan.” In what was
meant to be a collaborative enterprise, Sam had refused to share any
equity with anyone. And now all these unprofitable effective altruists
were demanding to be paid millions to quit—and doing whatever they could
to trash Sam’s reputation with the outside world until they got their
money. “It felt super weird,” said Nishad. “It felt wild for money to be
the object of our focus rather than something else. I thought caring
about money itself was morally bankrupt.”</p>
<p>In the end, for Sam to leave he had to want to leave, and Sam did not
really want to leave. And so, on April 9, 2018, his entire management
team, along with half of his employees, walked out the door, with
somewhere between one and two million dollars in severance. At that
moment, the outside investors were in the same uneasy position as Bob’s
friend. They heard two radically different stories about Sam, one from
the management team, the other from Sam. But as one put it, “There was
no smoking gun.” No one thing Sam had done for which they could easily
condemn him. It was, as Tara said, “one hundred small things.” The
investors had no real idea whom or what to believe, or even how to
figure out whom or what to believe. “There may be ways in which I
shouldn’t trust Sam, but it felt nuanced,” said one. They’d all made
their money in start-ups; they all knew that start-ups were chaotic. Now
they had to decide: Was Sam a reckless, phony effective altruist who was
going to steal or lose all their money, or were these other people
simply unsuited to working in a start-up hedge fund? It was one or the
other, an either/or question, to which they responded probabilistically.
Just about all of them kept money invested in Alameda, but just about
all of them reduced the size of their investments. The capital at Sam’s
disposal plunged from 70 million to 0 million. He wouldn’t be able to
trade as much as he had before, but he could still trade.</p>
<p>The remaining employees were also in the position of Bob’s friend, in
that most of them didn’t understand what had happened. Sam had fully
absorbed the Jane Street management technique of letting the rank and
file see only their tiny piece of the puzzle, reserving for himself a
view of the whole. Gary, though unintentionally, had done something
similar with the computer code, which was indecipherable to everyone but
him. “Gary was the only person who understood how to code it, and Gary
didn’t talk to anyone,” said Nishad. The company was a bit of a black
box to nearly everyone still inside it. Nishad was briefly on the fence
about staying but decided that, as inept as Sam was with other human
beings, and as little as he understood what Gary had built, he’d rather
throw in his lot with Sam and Gary and see what happened. He’d do what
he could to teach Sam about other people’s feelings. “One thing I think
would make people feel heard in the one-on-ones,” he wrote to Sam, soon
after half the company had quit, “is if you asked about their emotional
states in general and their emotional takes.”</p>
<p>What happened next, in retrospect, seems faintly incredible. With no
one left to argue with him, Sam threw the switch and let Modelbot rip.
“We turned it on and it instantly started making us lots of money,” said
Nishad. And then they finally found the million worth of missing XRP.
First they figured out its travel itinerary: it had been sent from
Kraken, a US crypto exchange, to an exchange in South Korean called
Bithumb. Then they figured out that the computer languages used by the
two exchanges were not perfectly compatible. Bithumb was able to receive
the XRP from Kraken but not the name of the person who owned the tokens.
The South Korean exchange had failed to detect the problem because it
was specific to Ripple’s coins—it occurred with no other
cryptocurrency—and there had only been one big player in the market
shipping massive amounts of them from Kraken to Bithumb. Inside Bithumb
in South Korea, the employees saw huge amounts of XRP piling up without
any indication of who it belonged to. Once Sam figured out where the
missing XRP was meant to be, he telephoned the Bithumb exchange
directly. The call was transferred around the company about three times
before a voice finally came on the line and said, “Are you the fucker
who sent us like twenty million Ripple tokens? How the fuck are you only
calling us now?” In the background Sam heard someone shouting, “Holy
fuck, we found them!”</p>
<p>They’d even paid their taxes. (Sam had brought in his dad to help
with that.) And they resumed making millions of dollars a month in
trading profits. They weren’t the same company, however. They were no
longer a random assortment of effective altruists. They were a small
team who had endured an alarming drama and now trusted Sam. He’d been
right all along! To those who remained—and even to some who had quit—Sam
went from someone they weren’t quite sure about to a leader to be
followed even if they didn’t completely understand what he was doing, or
why. (“Ex post I was wrong and we should have been willing to have a
higher risk appetite,” one of the departed members of the management
team later said.) An odd company from the start had just become even
more odd. The people inside were those most able to tailor their
thoughts and feelings to those of its creator.</p>
<p>“To Sam: Sorry I wrote all of this in the third person,” wrote
Caroline, in late 2018. “I didn’t decide to send it to you until the
end.” The turmoil had been stressful for Caroline; but she’d left her
job at Jane Street and had no obvious place to go, and so, even though
she wasn’t sure whom or what to believe, she’d stuck it out. The dust
had settled on what was being called The Schism, and only Sam was still
ruminating on the meaning of it all. Alameda Research had righted itself
and was consistently profitable. All was not right with Caroline,
however. Which was why she was now writing to her boss.</p>
<p>“What is the problem?” she asked, in what at first glance appeared to
be a business memo.</p>
<p>I have pretty strong romantic feelings for Sam.</p>
<p>Not a business memo! It was merely written in a businesslike
manner.</p>
<p>Why is this a problem?</p>
<p>These feelings consume a ton of my brainspace</p>
<p>This prevents me from thinking about other important things and takes
up a lot of my time</p>
<p>These feelings can often be positive or feel good but are on net
unpleasant</p>
<p>They affect my ability to work</p>
<p>– Mainly by amplifying work-related feelings in unhelpful ways
e.g. “I did a bad job on this thing”-&gt; “now Sam will hate me”-&gt;
sad</p>
<p>The memo went on for four pages. She clearly wanted to be heard, and
equally clearly sensed that her intended audience was likely to be
playing a video game as he half listened. She pressed on anyway,
sounding logical, or at least reasonable, about what were at bottom
emotional needs.</p>
<p>I feel embarrassed because the current situation just seems like so
the obvious result of all the choices I’ve made. I’m not sure what
choices I should have made differently, though. It’s possible I
shouldn’t have worked at Alameda in the first place, though at the time
I honestly didn’t think it would be an issue (“kinda attracted to my
boss” was also an issue when I worked with Turner and it was a 100%
nonissue.) Maybe I shouldn’t have slept with Sam, though by that point
it kind of felt like the feelings/desires were going to get worse over
time and become unbearable unless I did something.</p>
<p>For Sam’s benefit, she imagined what he might be thinking about her.
(“The last thing he told me was that he feels ‘conflicted.’ I imagine
the conflicting desires here are wanting to sleep with me, etc,
vs. worry about negative professional consequences.”) She listed the
things Sam had done that bothered her, among them giving off “confusing
signals, e.g telling me that he felt conflicted about having sex with
me, then having sex with me, then ignoring me for a few months.” She
attempted an expected value analysis of their clandestine relationship,
such as it was, starting with the costs:</p>
<p>scandal if it comes out</p>
<p>conflict of interest stuff</p>
<p>work-related tensions</p>
<p>She ended by wondering if she might not be better off quitting her
job at Alameda Research and cutting off all contact with Sam. On the
other hand …</p>
<p>It would be ideal if Sam and I could have a discussion to understand
each other’s feelings and reach a conclusion about what to do.</p>
<p>Ideal, perhaps. However, unlikely under the best of circumstances,
and circumstances were soon less than best. Not long before Caroline was
moved to write her memo to herself and then share it with Sam, Sam had
left for what was meant to be a brief trip to Hong Kong. After he read
her memo, he called the fifteen or so people still working for him in
downtown Berkeley to say he wasn’t coming back.</p>
