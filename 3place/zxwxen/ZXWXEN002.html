<h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>
<p>I first heard about Sam Bankman-Fried at the end of 2021 from a
friend who, oddly enough, wanted me to help him figure out who he was.
My friend was about to close a deal with Sam that would bind their
fates, through an exchange of shares in each other’s companies worth
hundreds of millions of dollars. He remained uneasy. He thought he
understood FTX, the crypto exchange that Sam had built, but he didn’t
have as good a feel for Sam himself. He’d asked around about Sam and
discovered that, as little as he felt he really knew him, other people,
even people who had invested millions of dollars in Sam’s company, knew
even less. My friend thought that the general ignorance might be
explained by Sam’s circumstances. FTX had been around only two and a
half years. Sam was only twenty-nine years old, a bit odd, and had spent
most of the previous three years outside the United States. All that
could explain why no one seemed to really know him. My friend asked me
if I could meet with Sam and report back whatever I made of him.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, Sam was on my front porch in Berkeley, California.
He’d emerged from an Uber in cargo shorts, a T-shirt, limp white socks
and ratty New Balance sneakers—which I soon learned were basically the
only clothes he owned. We went for a walk—the only time in the next two
years I would ever see this person who was always dressed for a hike
actually go for one. During our walk I prodded him with questions, but
after a while I was mostly just listening. The stuff he was telling
me—all of which, I should say here, turned out to be true—was
incredible. The sums of money in his life, for a start. Not just the
tens of billions of dollars he’d accumulated in the previous two years
but the hundreds of millions being thrown at him by leading Silicon
Valley venture capitalists who (as one later told me) thought Sam had a
real shot at being the world’s first trillionaire. FTX’s revenues were
growing at an astonishing rate: from 0 million in 2019, to 00 million in
2020, to billion in 2021. On our walk I asked him how much it would take
for him to sell FTX and go do something other than make money. He
thought the question over. “One hundred and fifty billion dollars,” he
finally said—though he added that he had use for “infinity dollars.”</p>
<p>Everything about him was peculiar, starting with motives—or at least
what he believed his motives to be. He didn’t come right out with all of
it on our walk, maybe because he realized how implausible it’d sound to
a total stranger. He needed infinity dollars because he planned to
address the biggest existential risks to life on earth: nuclear war,
pandemics far more deadly than Covid, artificial intelligence that
turned on mankind and wiped us out, and so on. To the list of problems
Sam hoped to tackle he’d recently added the assault on American
democracy, which, if successful, would make all of the other big
problems far less likely to be solved. One hundred fifty billion was
about what was needed to make a dent in at least one of the big
problems.</p>
<p>There were also a bunch of smaller problems that money might solve
that had Sam thinking about whether to throw it at them, too. The
Bahamas, for instance. A few months before I met him, apparently in
response to the crackdown on cryptocurrencies by the Chinese government,
Sam had moved his entire company from Hong Kong to the Bahamas. The good
thing about the Bahamas, from Sam’s point of view, was that it had
created regulations, which the United States had not, to legitimize a
crypto futures exchange. The bad thing was that Covid had gutted its
economy. The country lacked the infrastructure to support the global
financial empire Sam hoped to build, and it was now too broke to create
one. He was just then trying to persuade forty or so employees, many of
whom had grown up in or around China, to move nine thousand miles to an
island without a school to which they’d be willing to send their kids.
Sam explained that he was trying to decide whether to simply pay off the
billion Bahamas national debt himself, so the country could fix their
roads and build schools and so on. He’d recently met with the new prime
minister to discuss this idea and some others. I learned later from one
of the prime minister’s aides that after the Bahamian general election
in September 2021, Sam was the first person the prime minister had
wanted to meet.</p>
<p>All of this would have sounded even more preposterous if Sam hadn’t
already done what he’d done—or if he hadn’t been so unusual. He hadn’t
been warped by money in the ways people often are. He wasn’t braggy. He
had opinions, but he didn’t seem to expect his listener to share them,
and he pretended to listen to mine even when what I was saying clearly
didn’t interest him. He didn’t even seem all that taken with his own
fantastic story. His mom and dad were law professors at Stanford who had
basically zero interest in money and were bewildered by what had become
of their son—that’s pretty much all I got out of him that day, and the
next few months. On the other hand, on subjects other than himself he
was refreshingly unguarded: he seemed willing to answer any question I
could think to ask about the crypto industry or his business. His
ambition was grandiose, but he wasn’t.</p>
<p>By the end of this walk I was totally sold. I called my friend and
said something like: Go for it! Swap shares with Sam Bankman-Fried! Do
whatever he wants to do! What could possibly go wrong? It was only later
that I realized I hadn’t even begun to answer his original question: Who
was this guy?</p>
