<h4 id="truth-serum">11 Truth Serum</h4>
<p>When the lawyer from Sullivan andandandand Cromwell sent him the
message asking him to sit tight because something big might be coming
his way, John Ray had no idea what that big thing might be. All he knew
was that whatever got to him would be a corpse. He knew nothing about
crypto or its culture. He wouldn’t have even wanted to be able to
explain bitcoin. He certainly didn’t know anything about FTX, and when
the Sullivan andandandand Cromwell lawyer referred to “SBF,” he didn’t
know who or what the guy was talking about. “I thought it might mean
‘small box Ford,’” said Ray. After a phone call on the night of Tuesday,
November 8, the Sullivan andandandand Cromwell lawyer had left him
hanging. Finally, late Wednesday morning, Ray received a text: It’s
insane. I’ll try to get back to you later. Then crickets until 12:33
a.m. on Friday, November 11. At that improbable hour, the Sullivan
andandandand Cromwell guy sent John Ray a text: they are still
considering whether you are the right candidate for the job. Two hours
later he texted again: SBF has gone underground. A part of John Ray
thought that he was getting too old for this game.</p>
<p>The game still needed John Ray, however. The wild and wonderful world
of US corporate bankruptcy was increasingly dominated by big law firms,
but there were still a few of these lone actors, like Ray, who played
the role of wildcatters. The law firms brought in the wildcatter to take
over as CEO of the failed firm, and the wildcatter in turn hired the law
firms. As a legal matter, at 4:30 in the morning on Friday, November 11,
2022, Sam Bankman-Fried DocuSigned FTX into bankruptcy and named John
Ray as FTX’s new CEO. As a practical matter, Sullivan andandandand
Cromwell lined up John Ray to replace Sam as the CEO of FTX, and then
John Ray hired Sullivan andandandand Cromwell as the lawyers for the
massive bankruptcy.fn1</p>
<p>Sullivan andandandand Cromwell was present on the scene only because
the firm had done a bunch of work for Sam back when everyone loved him.
They’d actually served as FTX’s lawyers when the exchange had gone
before US regulators to answer questions like: Are there any conflicts
of interest between FTX and Alameda Research? Sam had never heard of
John Ray, and he hadn’t wanted to sign the bankruptcy papers. Or rather,
there had been a period of about two hours on the morning of November 11
when he’d been willing to sign them. Up to that moment, he’d listened to
the lawyers from Sullivan andandandand Cromwell, and to his own father,
with the combination of disinterest and polite skepticism that he
reserved for grown-ups who were just telling him to do whatever
grown-ups normally did. They were all saying that if he didn’t sign the
documents, he was going to be thrown into bankruptcy by various barbaric
countries: he and FTX would be in safer hands in the United States than
in other jurisdictions. Sam wasn’t sure this was so.</p>
<p>While Sam stewed, John Ray read up on him and this company he’d
created. “It’s like, What is this thing?” said Ray. “Now it’s just a
failure, but it was once some kind of business. What did you guys do?
What’s the situation? Why’s this falling into bankruptcy so quickly?” He
briefly considered the possibility that the failure was innocent: maybe
they got hacked. “Then you start looking at the kid,” said Ray, the kid
being Sam. “I looked at his picture and thought, There’s something wrong
going on with him.” Ray prided himself on his snap judgments. He could
look at a person and in ten minutes know who they were, and never need
to reconsider his opinion. The men he evaluated he tended to place in
one of three bins in his mind: “good guy,” “naive guy,” and “crook.” Sam
very obviously was not a good guy. And he sure didn’t seem naive.</p>
<p>Sam had been led to believe that whoever succeeded him as CEO would
at the very least use him as a resource, to help find the missing money.
That was never going to happen. In the early days of his career in
bankruptcy, back in the 1990s, John Ray had learned a lesson the hard
way. One of the crooks he’d replaced engaged him in conversation and
then lied about what had been said. In the first few days after he
signed the company over to Ray, Sam reached out to him, over and over,
with these pitiful emails. Hey John, I’d really love to talk. Ray took
one look at them and thought, No way, José.</p>
<p>His unwillingness to interact in any way with Sam of course made it
more difficult to figure out what Sam had done, or why he’d done it.
“It’s literally like you’re pulling out a box of puzzle pieces and some
of the pieces are missing and you can’t talk to the guy who created the
puzzle,” said Ray. He’d spoken only long enough with the other members
of Sam’s inner circle to see them for what they were. Nishad Singh
struck him as a naive guy. “He’s narrow,” said Ray. “It’s tech, tech,
tech. There’s never a problem he can’t solve. He’s not going to steal
money. He’s not going to do anything wrong. But he has no idea what’s
going on around him. You ask him for a steak and he puts his head up the
bull’s ass.” The bankruptcy team had located Caroline Ellison by phone
on the Saturday after Ray became FTX’s new CEO. She at least had been
able to explain where some of the wallets storing the crypto were
stashed. Other than that, she wasn’t much use. “She’s cold as ice,” said
Ray. “You had to buy words by the vowel. An obvious complete fucking
weirdo.”</p>
<p>As Caroline spoke, Ray had tried to figure out where she was. She
claimed to be in Boston. Ray knew that wasn’t true. He made chitchat
that sounded more innocent than it was. Was it a long flight from Hong
Kong? How’s the weather where you are? The FBI was looking for Caroline,
and he intended to help them find her.fn2 He had a clear, narrowly
defined job: to find as much money as he could and return that money to
the creditors. Almost as soon as he became the new CEO of FTX, he took
on a second, far more loosely defined one: helping US prosecutors make
their case against Sam Bankman-Fried. “There’s people that are born
criminals, and there’re people that become criminals,” said Ray. “I
think he became a criminal. The how and why he became a criminal I don’t
know. I think maybe it takes an understanding of this kid and his
parents.”</p>
<p>Then all was chaos. Sam signed the papers and announced eight minutes
later that he’d changed his mind, only to have Sullivan andandandand
Cromwell inform him that there was no updating after you’d declared
bankruptcy. That cleared the way for Ray to be briefed on FTX. He now
learned that FTX owned thirty different crypto exchanges—not just in the
Bahamas and the US but also in Turkey and Japan and, well, you name it.
Wherever people traded crypto in size, FTX had incorporated an exchange
and sought a government license. Each exchange had money on it and
customers who in theory could log in and withdraw their deposits. So far
as Ray could see, which was not very far, no money was moving. “There
was no sheet of paper with bank account information on it,” he said.
Inside scores of small banks and far-flung crypto exchanges, FTX or
Alameda or one of the more than one hundred other corporate entities
they controlled held many dollars and other fiat currencies. There were
also, on some Amazon server, passcodes that gave you access to virtual
wallets with crypto inside. “The wallets were in the cloud,” said Ray.
“You lose the passcodes, you lose the money.”</p>
<p>If the money was hard to find, it was in part because there was no
person inside of FTX—at least no person Ray was willing to speak with—in
charge of knowing where it all was. “There was no structure,” said Ray.
“No list of employees.fn3 No org chart.” Six days into his new job, Ray
filed a report with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware. “Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of
corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial
information as occurred here,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Instead of grilling the people who had created the mess, Ray hired
teams of hard-nosed sleuths—many of whom he’d worked with before.
“Serious adults,” as he called them. The Nardello firm was a lot of
former FBI guys. (Corporate motto: We find out.) Chainalysis, the crypto
sleuthing firm, was new to him. Ray told his people to “do a Zoom
interview with every single FTX employee. And if they don’t contact you
to arrange a time, they’re fired.” Maybe eighty employees got themselves
fired that way. Just about everyone else would be fired after their Zoom
call. Even if you came out of the woods with your hands in the air you
got shot. “He was acting like every single person who was not in the
United States was part of a crime, but he didn’t know what the crime
was,” as one FTX employee put it. On a group Zoom call to talk about the
mysterious roughly 50 million hack that had happened the day of the
collapse, Sam himself popped up. Hey, Sam here! Ray said, imitating
Sam’s chipper tone, itself an imitation. “We were trying to figure out
what the fuck is going on and who hacked us,” said Ray. “He knows
nothing about the hack. He keeps saying, ‘You have to ask Gary.’ He pops
up later and says, ‘I need my passwords to get into the system.’ I’m
like, Fuck no.”</p>
<p>Within a few weeks, Ray had fired pretty much everyone with deep
knowledge of whatever had happened inside FTX and Alameda Research. He
could think of but one exception. “I think they’re still paying the
psychiatrist,” said Ray.</p>
<p>That was in early 2023. By late April, John Ray’s head was on a
swivel. “This is live-action,” he said. “There’s always something every
hour.” One day, some random crypto exchange got in touch and said, By
the way, we have 70 million in an account of yours: do you want it back?
Another day, some random FTX employee called them out of the blue to say
that he’d borrowed two million bucks from the company and wanted to
repay the loan—of which, so far as Ray could see, there was no record.
Of course, once you heard about one loan, you had to wonder how many
others like it you’d never hear about. The search for money inside Sam’s
World reminded Ray of the Easter egg hunt he’d just run for his
grandchildren. “At the end they have a count,” he said. “Five are
missing. They go out and look for them. They come back with six.” The
extra egg was a yellowing relic undiscovered the previous year. His
teenaged grandchild had said to him: This is just like your new job! And
it was true! John Ray was on a bizarre Easter egg hunt with no prior egg
count. With no idea how many eggs he was looking for, he’d never know
when to end his search.</p>
<p>Several months into the hunt, Ray’s sleuths had discovered that
“someone had robbed the exchange of four hundred fifty million.” They’d
stumbled upon not the simple hack of November 2022 but the complicated
BitMax and MobileCoin hacks of 00 million in the spring of 2021. (The
dollar value changed with fluctuations in the price of the stolen
crypto.) They’d tracked the hacker not to Turkey but Mauritius. “We have
a picture of him going in and out of his house,” said Ray. He was pretty
sure he was going to get most of that money back. “We believe there are
a lot more of these,” said Ray. Eventually, I figured, he’d find the
billion or so lost in hacks that Sam would have just told him about, if
he’d been willing to talk to Sam.fn4</p>
<p>It was true, as Sam said, that people don’t see what they’re not
looking for. It was also true that they have a talent for seeing
whatever it is they expect to see. John Ray expected to see evidence of
a crime. To our meetings he always brought new and seemingly damning
pieces. One time, he’d found Alameda Research’s US tax forms from 2021,
for instance. Alameda had reported a loss of more than billion. If it
was what it seemed to be, it would help to explain the hole in my
private balance sheet; but it was actually just a piece of a bigger and
more complicated puzzle. That year, Alameda Research had sold short FTT
at the same time an entity it controlled bought the same quantity of
FTT. The price of FTT had gone up, a lot. Alameda Research suffered a
multibillion-dollar trading loss; the second entity had taken in a
precisely corresponding multibillion-dollar gain. The accounting rules
for Alameda Research allowed it to report unrealized market losses as
tax losses; the accounting rules for the other entity did not require
that it do the obverse with its gains. Alameda’s tax lawyers, a group
that included Sam’s father, had argued for taking the tax loss, as it
could be offset against current gains. It was, as one of the lawyers put
it, “a fake loss.”</p>
<p>Back in June 2022, Nishad Singh had filled my ears with the many
devious ways people sought to extort money from FTX. Several employees
had joined the firm, been found wanting at their jobs, and been
fired—then had sought out one of several law firms that famously
specialized in shaking down crypto firms.fn5 Nishad had been outraged
not merely that the various accusations the fired employees had made
were pure inventions but that everyone involved knew that FTX would
rather pay out several million dollars than endure the cost of a false
accusation. “The American employees are the problem,” he said. “The
Chinese employees don’t do this.” FTX had finally cooked up a strategy
they called Operation Warm Blanket. Operation Warm Blanket identified
the law firms that engaged in the shakedowns and retained them to do
legal work, so that they couldn’t sue FTX. At the time, it seemed smart;
less so two years later, with John Ray waving documents and arguing that
Sam had paid hush money to settle whistleblower complaints.</p>
<p>To John Ray it felt like an Easter egg hunt. To me it felt more like
an amateur archaeologist had stumbled upon a previously unknown
civilization. Unable to learn anything about its customs or its
language, he just started digging. The artifacts unearthed by the
excavation lent themselves to an interpretation that would have puzzled
the aboriginals who had created and used them. But the pleasure Ray took
in whatever he unearthed was so infectious that I often didn’t have the
heart to say, “I’m not quite sure that you’ve found exactly what you
think you have found,” or “I actually know what that is, and it isn’t
what you think.” At some point his team discovered that a Hong Kong
subsidiary of Alameda Research called Cottonwood Grove had bought vast
sums of FTT, for example. To the innocent archaeologist, it was evidence
of Sam’s World artificially propping up the value of FTT. Ray didn’t
know that FTX had been obligated to spend roughly a third of its
revenues buying back and burning its token, and that Cottonwood Grove
was the entity that did it.</p>
<p>From my perch on the side of the dig, I would occasionally shout down
to the guy running it my guess about the most recent find, but he’d just
look up at me, pityingly. I was clearly a naive guy. During one of our
meetings, Ray asked, “Did you ever hear of this guy Zane Hacket?” He’d
gotten the name wrong but he’d discovered that Zane had pulled many
thousands of dollars’ worth of crypto off the exchange in the weeks
before the collapse. And he had! In the weeks before the collapse, Zane
had bought some stuff. But Zane had also deposited a million and a half
dollars’ worth of crypto onto the exchange the Sunday of the collapse.
He had the receipts to prove it: when FTX vanished, much of Zane’s
wealth vanished with it. Zane’s problem wasn’t that he was a crook but
that he was too trusting. The same was true of almost all of FTX’s
employees, many of whom had lost everything. Their lost civilization had
been built not on cynicism but on trust.</p>
<p>That was hard for the archaeologist with no prior knowledge of it to
see. Ray’s first impression of Sam and his inner circle was the starting
point for a narrative that could be imposed on almost any of the
remaining fragments of Sam’s World. The hundreds of private investments
made by Alameda Research, for instance. When we first met, in early
2023, Ray went on about how fishy these all were. He had a theory about
why Sam had thrown money around the way he had: Sam was buying himself
some friends. “For the first time in his life, everyone ignores the fact
that he’s a fucking weirdo,” said Ray. As an example, he cited the
dollars Sam had invested in artificial intelligence companies. “He gave
five hundred million bucks to this thing called Anthropic,” said Ray.
“It’s just a bunch of people with an idea. Nothing.” A few weeks later,
Google and Stark Capital and a few other companies invested 50 million
in Anthropic. The terms revalued the stake Sam had bought for 00 million
to 00 million. I knew at least one investor who thought that if that
stake was broken up into smaller pieces and slowly sold off, it might
easily fetch a billion.</p>
<p>Once Ray’s people had finished doing the math, they concluded that
FTX still owed its customers .6 billion. There were at least three ways
the money might be found to repay them. The first was the Easter egg
hunt, the search for company funds that might still be stashed in banks
and crypto exchanges. A second was to sell whatever was left over inside
the dragon’s lair—not just the stake in Anthropic but the hundreds of
other private investments and the vast pile of lesser-known
cryptocurrencies. The third was to claw back money from the people Sam
paid to be his friends—his investments in other people’s funds, his
political donations, even his philanthropic gifts.</p>
<p>To wring the money out of the people Sam had hurled it at, John Ray
needed to prove two things. The first was that FTX hadn’t received
equivalent value for its money. You couldn’t claw back money from a
plumber who’d been paid some normal sum to unclog an FTX drain. But you
could claw back money from the researcher to whom FTX had handed a grant
to invent drains that never clogged. Simply not getting value for money
was not enough for Ray to get it back, however. He also had to prove
that at the moment Sam gave money away, it wasn’t his money to give. And
the only way it wasn’t Sam’s money was if FTX, in the moment he gave
away the money, was insolvent, or nearly so. Ray’s various attempts to
claw back money raised an interesting question, which his team had yet
to answer in an intelligible way: At what point was there less money in
all of Sam’s World than was supposed to be inside of FTX? Exactly when
did FTX go broke?</p>
<p>Instead of answering the question, Ray launched a blitzkrieg of
lawsuits against various people to whom Sam had handed money. These were
really fun to read. They were still legal texts, but they all had
subtexts. Plus, Ray wrote to attract media attention. “You have to tell
a story,” explained Ray. “Nobody wants to read X dollars wired to Y,
blah, blah, blah. You need the imagination of a child to write this
stuff.” In the first eight and a half months, he filed nine of these
clawback lawsuits. Ray mainly targeted insiders—Sam, Sam’s parents,
Caroline, Nishad, and so forth—or people to whom Sam had forked over
huge sums to invest on his behalf.fn6 His most revealing target, at
least to me, was FTX’s lawyer Dan Friedberg.</p>
<p>In Sam’s World, Dan Friedberg—who was in his early fifties—had been
the only important grown-up. At the behest of Sam’s father, he’d left a
multimillion-dollar-a-year job at the law firm Fenwick andandandand West
to chase after Sam wherever he went. He was FTX’s general counsel. He
was also the babysitter. To a baby who terrifies his parents and is
calling the shots. He’d followed Sam to Hong Kong and then moved again
to the Bahamas, where he spent a lot of time looking out of place in
Bermuda shorts. Friedberg was who Sam usually had in mind when he
complained about the pointless stuff that grown-ups asked him to worry
about. Even in good times, it was obvious that Friedberg had had only so
much influence on him, or on the operation, though Friedberg’s name of
course appeared on many official documents. He’d helped to set up the
bank accounts that received the deposits from FTX’s customers. He’d
helped to execute Operation Warm Blanket. But in the week of FTX’s
collapse, he’d been the first employee to abandon ship, and had gone
immediately to the US financial regulators and the FBI. Even then, he
didn’t know exactly what had happened between FTX and Alameda—just that
whatever it was was bad. And he was completely, totally crushed. He’d
sort of gotten swept up by the enthusiasm of the effective altruists. “I
wanted there to be a Sam,” as he put it.</p>
<p>Friedberg’s most serious offense, I suspected, had been committed
after the collapse. After he’d joined FTX, he’d moved about a million
dollars’ worth of crypto from his account on Coinbase onto FTX US. He’d
tried, and failed, to attach himself to a suit brought by other
creditors to prevent Sullivan andandandand Cromwell from controlling the
bankruptcy, and thus all the evidence of what had happened. No one had
asked Dan Friedberg to reach out to the bankruptcy judge; all by himself
he’d just filed a declaration with the Delaware bankruptcy court. The
literary energy of the thing exceeded even John Ray’s. It explained
that, back in late 2020, Friedberg had hired a Sullivan andandandand
Cromwell partner named Ryne Miller to become the general counsel for FTX
US. He wrote that Miller had told him back then that he hoped to return
to Sullivan andandandand Cromwell—and so he needed to direct as much FTX
legal work as he could toward his future employer. FTX had subsequently
paid Sullivan andandandand Cromwell between 0 million and 0 million in
fees. In one instance, Friedberg alleged, Sullivan andandandand Cromwell
had billed FTX .5 million for work that should have cost a small
fraction of that amount.</p>
<p>At any rate, in the week of the collapse, when it became clear that
FTX was bankrupt, the lawyers argued about what to do. Along with all
the other lawyers, Friedberg had resigned. Miller alone had stayed on
and pushed for Sam to sign the bankruptcy documents and for Sullivan
andandandand Cromwell to run the bankruptcy proceedings. It was also
Miller, wrote Friedberg, who pushed for FTX US to be included in the
bankruptcy—even though FTX US was a wholly separate entity and appeared
to be solvent.fn7 Miller had done this for two reasons, Friedberg
alleged. The first was to strengthen the case for the lucrative
bankruptcy to unfold in the United States, as opposed to, say, the
Bahamas. The other was that FTX US controlled a pool of 00 million that
could be used to pay Sullivan andandandand Cromwell. At the end of his
declaration, Friedberg wrote, “I am not the only former FTX employee who
has serious concerns about SandandandandC. Both former and current
employees are scared to raise these issues because SandandandandC might
take adverse action against them.”</p>
<p>Inside the US bankruptcy system, there existed a frustrating and
often frustrated character called the trustee. Employed by the US
Department of Justice, the trustee was meant to serve as a check on the
insiders who profited from the bankruptcy. (And who controlled the
evidence for any criminal cases.) But the only power the trustee had
been given by law was the power to bitch and moan to the bankruptcy
judge, himself usually a former bankruptcy lawyer. The US Trustee
assigned to the FTX case, Andrew Vara, had written a strongly worded
letter to the judge, John T. Dorsey, arguing that Sullivan andandandand
Cromwell shouldn’t be allowed to run the bankruptcy, and that an
independent examiner should be brought in to police it. Dorsey had
denied the request. He did the same with Dan Friedberg’s. At the hearing
to decide whether Sullivan andandandand Cromwell could run the
bankruptcy, witnesses were allowed to appear in person or by Zoom.
Friedberg had Zoomed in, uninvited, and offered to testify under oath.
Dorsey refused to allow it.</p>
<p>Outside the US courtroom, Friedberg had one of the better views of
what had occurred inside Sam’s World and maybe the finest view of the
role Sullivan andandandand Cromwell had played in it. Inside the
courtroom, Dan Friedberg’s experience was deemed irrelevant. And that,
it seemed, was the end of it. US bankruptcy judges have sensational
powers to determine which evidence to admit in a case.</p>
<p>But then in late June, John Ray made Dan Friedberg relevant again, by
suing him in bankruptcy court. Ray had his own response to the dispute
between Ryne Miller and Dan Friedberg. He thought Miller “a naive guy.”
He thought Friedberg “a born criminal.”</p>
<p>Dan Friedberg hadn’t been charged with a crime. He was cooperating
with the Department of Justice in their investigation. Ray didn’t have
the power to charge Friedberg with a crime. In his lawsuit, which sought
to claw back all the money FTX had paid Dan Friedberg, Ray listed the
bad things he thought Friedberg had done. He also listed the monies that
he wanted Friedberg to return. Most of the money was in a single line
item. “In July 2020, “wrote Ray, “the FTX Group caused Friedberg to be
granted 102,321,128 Serum tokens, a digital currency launched by the
Solana Foundation in 2020 …. At the time of Plaintiff’s bankruptcy
filing the value of Serum was estimated at $.33 per token, and therefore
Friedberg’s Serum holdings were worth 3,765,972.20.”</p>
<p>Before I read that line, I had only ever heard Ray refer to Serum
(and Solana and FTT) as “Sam Coins” or “shitcoins.” His view of crypto
was a bit like his view of people. There was “the good shit” and “the
bad shit.” (Though no naive shit.) I’d never tried to argue with him, in
part because I thought he was sort of right. Still, there were
distinctions worth making that he hadn’t bothered to make. FTT received
an actual cash flow—the robust revenues from FTX—and so was more like
corporate equity. Solana, because it could process tens of thousands
more transactions per second than Bitcoin, was perhaps better designed
than Bitcoin to fulfill Satoshi’s original vision and become a means of
exchange. In any case, because a sufficient number of people had come to
believe that story, there was a real market for Solana tokens, and the
pile that Sam had accumulated still had value.</p>
<p>Serum was, by comparison, a dubious proposition. Serum was more like
a currency in the private board game Sam never stopped playing inside
his own mind.</p>
<p>Serum was Sam’s bet on blockchains replacing, say, the New York Stock
Exchange or, for that matter, FTX. Blockchains were just communally
maintained records of who owned what and when they’d owned it. They
could keep track of any transaction. It was at least theoretically
possible that they could keep track of all financial transactions. The
Serum tokens that Friedberg had been paid gave their owner trading
discounts on, voting rights over, and a slice of the tiny fee charged
for any financial transaction that occurred on the Solana blockchain.
Which sounded great. The problem was that there were relatively few
financial transactions on the Solana blockchain. Sam had simply cooked
up the idea with Solana’s founders, minted ten billion of these Serum
tokens, kept most of them for himself—but handed some to his employees,
as pay.</p>
<p>The Serum tokens Sam paid to employees like Friedberg appeared to be
fetching $.33 at the time of his bankruptcy. Their true value was not as
clear. The FTX employees’ Serum tokens were “locked”; the employees were
forbidden from selling them until they became unlocked. The person who
did the unlocking was Sam. Initially, the tokens were meant to be
unlocked over the course of seven years, starting at the end of the
first year. Employees could sell one-seventh of their Serum at the end
of that first year, and another seventh at the end of each of the
following years, until they’d sold it all.</p>
<p>Soon after Serum’s creation, its price had skyrocketed. Sam clearly
had not anticipated this. He now had all these employees who felt
ridiculously rich. (At least in theory, the value of Dan Friedberg’s
Serum stash peaked, in September 2021, at over billion.) In Sam’s view,
everyone at once became a lot less motivated to work fourteen-hour days.
And so he did a very Sam thing: he changed the terms of the employees’
Serum. In the fine print of the employee Serum contract, he’d reserved
for himself the right to extend Serum’s jail time, and he used it to
lock up all employees’ Serum for seven years. Sam’s employees had always
known that he preferred games in which the rules could change in the
middle. They now understood that if he had changed the rules once, he
might do it again. They became less enthusiastic about their Serum. “It
was very unclear if you had it or if you didn’t have it,” said Ramnik,
who had watched in irritation as Sam locked up a bunch of tokens that
he’d bought with his own money on the open market before he joined FTX.
“I guess you would know in seven years.”</p>
<p>The market even for ordinary Serum tokens wasn’t great. There was no
chance that Dan Friedberg could have sold 102 million Serum tokens at
the stated market price. Serum that you effectively would not possess
for seven years and maybe not even then—who would have the courage to
guess what that was worth? Zero, perhaps? That’s what Forbes magazine
had concluded, even as Serum’s price was peaking, when they valued Sam’s
holdings. They’d treated his locked Serum tokens as if they didn’t
exist.</p>
<p>And yet now, somehow, in John Ray’s book, the locked Serum was good
shit. Primo crypto of the finest vintage imbibed by all gentlemen of
good taste. And who knows?—maybe one day it will be. But if Serum was a
token to be taken seriously, Sam Bankman-Fried and the world he created
needed to be viewed in a different light. At Serum’s peak price, the
stated market value of Sam’s stash of it was 7 billion. On November 7,
2022, Sam’s pile of mostly locked Serum was still “worth” billions of
dollars. If even locked Serum had that kind of value, FTX was solvent
right up to the moment it collapsed. And John Ray would have no grounds
for clawing back money from any of the many lucky people on whom Sam
Bankman-Fried had showered it.</p>
<p>Six months into the Easter egg hunt, there was a decent argument to
be made that FTX was solvent right up to the moment it collapsed, even
if Sam’s Serum was worthless. The hunt had gone better than anyone
without a very deep working knowledge of Sam’s motives and methods could
have expected. At the end of June 2023, John Ray filed a report on his
various collections. “To date, the Debtors have recovered approximately
billion in liquid assets,” he wrote, “and they anticipate additional
recoveries.” Seven point three billion, to be exact. That haul didn’t
include the Serum, or any large clawbacks, or the money stolen by the
guy in Mauritius, or the stake in Anthropic, or most of the other
private investments. An investor who was hoping to bid for the remaining
portfolio told me that, if it was sold intelligently, it should go for
at least billion. That would raise the amount collected to .3
billion—even before anyone asked CZ for the .275 billion he’d taken out
of FTX. Ray was inching toward an answer to the question I’d been asking
from the day of the collapse: Where did all that money go? The answer
was: nowhere. It was still there.</p>
<p>Caroline had been the first to plead guilty and take whatever deal
the prosecutors had implicitly offered. Gary and Nishad soon followed.
All sorts of people who had no idea exactly what had happened inside
Sam’s World now thought they knew all they needed to know. A surprising
number of them thought the crime should have been obvious all along. It
hadn’t been. Hedge fund managers who had shorted the stocks of US banks
that banked crypto routinely spread nasty rumors about the banks’ crypto
customers, like FTX, in an attempt to damage the banks. If any of these
people had known the truth about FTX, they most certainly would have
said it. They didn’t. Even those who had expressed suspicion about Sam
or FTX had failed to say the one simple thing you would say if you knew
the secret they were hiding: the customers’ deposits that are supposed
to be inside FTX are actually inside Alameda Research.</p>
<p>The authorities in the Bahamas had jailed Sam and after a lot of the
usual Sam-induced complications extradited him to the United States. In
an indictment brought by the US attorney’s office for the Southern
District of New York, the US Department of Justice charged Sam with
various crimes and then allowed him to post 50 million bond as bail. Sam
hadn’t posted 50 million. Sam’s parents had posted their home and
assumed the risk that he would jump bail—in which case they would, in
theory, owe 50 million to the US government. They didn’t have 50
million. The prosecutors didn’t mind; they seemed to care mainly that
the press report that Sam Bankman-Fried was still in possession of at
least 50 million. Once that happened, lots of people who should have
known better but who’d fallen into the habit of speaking without
thinking took to Twitter to say that Sam’s ability to fork over 50
million made up their minds about his guilt. But most people hadn’t
waited even that long. “Your son is a dirty, filthy rotten typical
criminal hooky-nosed selfish greedy jew,” someone calling himself J.
Revick had emailed Joe Bankman, the day FTX filed for bankruptcy. All
the Bankman-Frieds received lots of messages like it. Joe had written
back: “Isn’t Revick a Jewish name?”</p>
<p>Mobs now gathered and sentiment now hardened more quickly than ever.
From a distance, it was soon easy to make up one’s mind about what had
happened inside Sam’s World, even before Sam had his day in court. From
a distance, it became almost taboo to raise any doubts about the nature
of Sam’s crime.fn8 Up close, it was hard not to have such doubts. The
closer a person was to him, and to the business, the more questions they
had about it. Zane Tackett, for instance, could not understand why,
toward the end of 2021, Sam hadn’t simply replaced the customers’
deposits inside of Alameda Research with loans from the crypto banks.
Back then, Alameda could have borrowed 5–0 billion without much trouble.
Why not take that money and move the .8 billion of customer money back
into FTX, so that if Alameda blew up it would take the crypto banks,
rather than FTX, with it? Ramnik had a different question. He and Sam
had invested billions of dollars of Alameda’s money—and yet he’d never
seen Sam pay attention to the risks Alameda was running. Sam’s attention
always seemed to be somewhere else. The question Ramnik wanted to ask
Sam was, “Why the fuck did you spend the last year playing Storybook
Brawl?”</p>
<p>I had my own questions, of course. The first one had to do with
financial incentives. None of the characters in this financial drama had
behaved as financial characters are expected to behave. Gary had owned a
piece of Alameda Research, but his stake in FTX was far more valuable.
Nishad owned a big chunk of FTX and none of Alameda Research. Ditto
Caroline, who ran Alameda Research but owned shares only in FTX. None of
these people had any interest in moving money out of FTX into Alameda
Research in a way that put FTX in jeopardy. Just the reverse: it might
as well have been their money that was being moved. And yet at least up
until late spring of 2022, when crypto prices began to plunge, and
possibly much later than that, none of them expressed disapproval of the
risk being taken with their fortunes. Why not?</p>
<p>And of course there was the question that would sit in the middle of
Sam’s trial, if indeed there was a trial. Ninety percent of those
accused of crimes by the US government in 2022 had accepted a deal and
pleaded guilty. Less than half of 1 percent had been acquitted. Going to
trial against the government felt a bit like playing an away game
against an opponent that started with vast material and psychological
advantages. Sam was hell-bent on going to trial—insisted that he was
innocent of fraudulent intent. To persuade others of his innocence,
however, he’d need to explain why his three closest colleagues were now
willing to plead guilty. Why would anyone say they had committed a crime
when they had not? Why did they seem themselves to believe they had
committed a crime?</p>
<p>Sam now had a lot of time to think, and he spent a lot of it thinking
about this. Human nature had always been something of a puzzle to him,
but puzzles could be solved. He sat down to write a memo, very like
those he’d written in response to Caroline’s. He was days away from a
gag order being imposed by the judge presiding over his case, Lewis A.
Kaplan, in response to a request from federal prosecutors. But for the
moment, he was still allowed to share his thoughts. “People seem to have
a really hard time having thoughts that go out on a societal limb,” he
wrote, “even if they never have to say anything about them.” He followed
this curious premise in the usual business memo–like manner:</p>
<p>It’s almost always easy to criticize, even if you’re talking about
something popular; nothing is perfect and you never really get punished
for pointing out the bad parts of otherwise good things.</p>
<p>And it’s easy to praise something that society praises</p>
<p>But it seems like the thing that really scares people—more so even
than the threat of jail—is acknowledging internally, to themselves, that
they are an example of the person who society disparages.</p>
<p>To which he added, “It’s sometimes easier for people to publicly be
the villain, than to privately have thoughts that others would judge
harshly were they to be public … in other words: sometimes courage of
thought is even harder than courage of action.” When the social pressure
reached a certain point, it was easier for people to cave to it than to
preserve their true identities.</p>
<p>As he wrote those words, he sat alone in a room in his childhood
home. He’d come full circle. He was back to where he started, only he
now wore an ankle monitor and was guarded by a German shepherd. Unable
to afford security, his parents had instead bought this extremely large
dog, named Sandor. Sandor had been flown in from Germany, where he had
been trained to kill on command. The commands were in German, however,
and while Sam’s parents had learned them, Sam had not.</p>
<p>The dog was there to protect Sam, and yet Sam couldn’t generate the
faintest interest in the dog. Joe had bought and read a book called
Inside of a Dog; Sam still thought books were sort of dumb and better
reduced to blog posts, and anyway he didn’t care what was inside of
Sandor. And so when Sam was in a room with the dog, it always felt as if
some accident was waiting to happen. Some terrible misunderstanding very
like the misunderstandings Sam had with other people. The odds of any
accident were obviously hard to estimate. Lower than an asteroid strike,
but surely greater than some artificial intelligence slipping its leash
and wiping humans from the face of the earth. But it would have been
very Sam Bankman-Fried to have been eaten by his own guard dog.</p>
