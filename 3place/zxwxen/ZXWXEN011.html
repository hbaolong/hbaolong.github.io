<h4 id="the-vanishing">9 The Vanishing</h4>
<p>I was only gone for a week or so. By the time I returned, Ramnik,
along with pretty much the entire corporate org chart, had fled the
island. Some meaningful percentage of the company’s fleet of cars had
been abandoned, keys still inside them, in the Bahamas airport lot. It
made for a bizarre scene: panicked employees of FTX and Alameda Research
struggling to escape against an incoming tide of oblivious tourists in
flip-flops and floral shirts. As they passed one another in the
terminal, giant airport video screens flashed the message over their
heads: Get Free Crypto Anytime, Anywhere. Download the FTX App. The day
I landed, Friday, November 11, the signs on the airport walls were still
cheerily pitching crypto—even though at four thirty that morning, Sam
had DocuSigned the papers that threw FTX into bankruptcy in the United
States.</p>
<p>It was late afternoon by the time Natalie collected me from the
airport, in one of the few cars that the local creditors had not tracked
down and repossessed. The night before she’d resigned from her job as
head of public relations and Sam’s life manager. She planned to leave
the next morning without most of her possessions or a clear idea of what
had happened. She knew what everyone now did: at least billion belonging
to crypto traders, and meant to be safe and sound inside FTX, had wound
up instead inside Alameda Research. What had become of the billion was
not entirely clear, but it wasn’t good. Natalie had wept when she’d
learned that, as she put it, “there was a button on FTX. Alameda could
take whatever risk it wanted to.” Like most FTX employees, she’d kept
her money on the exchange. Now it was all gone. Like most FTX employees,
she felt as if she’d been living a dream. Already the dream was growing
fuzzy and requiring effort to recall. Could it really be true that she’d
been next-door neighbors with Vince Carter?</p>
<p>Between Sunday and Wednesday, the inner circle of effective altruists
had been holed up in Sam’s sleeping quarters, trying and failing to save
the company. Natalie now had only a vague sense of their whereabouts or
states of mind. On Wednesday, George Lerner had determined that Nishad
was a suicide risk and arranged for him to be escorted out of the
country and to his parents, in San Francisco. As the company collapsed,
Caroline had been traveling in Asia and had remained there in an odd
mood. She struck her psychiatrist, and others to whom she had spoken, as
somewhere between relieved and happy. She too was now rumored to be
heading back to her parents’ house, in the Boston area. Gary was as
silent as ever and impossible to read but apparently still around. And
Sam—well, Natalie didn’t know what, if anything, Sam was actually
feeling, or even where he was. Tracking Sam was no longer her job.</p>
<p>The road from the airport to the Albany resort passed FTX’s offices.
Natalie was uneasy about me trying to see them. She feared they might
contain the people repossessing the company cars. Still, as we
approached, we slowed. The guard booth was empty. The barrier was down
but blocked as little of the road as ever. There was no sign of life on
the field of asphalt; the cars were gone; the jungle huts seemed
entirely abandoned. Then, on the far side of the lot, a figure rounded a
hut and came into focus. It was Sam, all by himself, in a bright red
T-shirt and shorts. Walking circles around his former empire. Even at a
distance, you could tell he could use a shower and a shave. He walked
over and climbed into the car, as if he’d been expecting us. He needed a
ride home, which of course raised the question of how, and why, he’d
come to be here in the first place.</p>
<p>“You know what’s weird to think about?” he said, as we left the
office behind. “Saturday. Saturday everything was normal.”</p>
<p>I did my best to reconstruct what had happened the previous few
weeks, before reconsidering what had happened the previous few years.
There’d been another dustup between Sam and CZ that, when it happened,
had not seemed all that important. In late October, Sam had flown to the
Middle East to raise money and, in the bargain, find a second home, in
the Eastern Hemisphere, for FTX. On the evening of October 24, 2022, he
bumped into CZ at a conference in Riyadh. It was the first time in
nearly three years they’d been in the same room. They’d had a brief,
awkward chat, only because it took less effort than not having it. “It
was a five-minute conversation in which no real information was
exchanged,” said Sam. “It was like fake nice. We dispensed with our
obligation to acknowledge we were both there.” The next day, Sam had
flown to Dubai to meet with its financial regulators. The regulators at
the time hoped that FTX might make Dubai its Eastern Hemisphere
headquarters. Sam later wrote up the message he’d tried to convey to
them. “I love Dubai,” he said.</p>
<p>But we can’t be in the same place as Binance …. This is for two
reasons: first they are constantly devoting significant company
resources to trying to hurt us; and second that they soil the reputation
of wherever they are. I can’t emphasize this enough: in general I hear
great things from other jurisdictions/regulators etc. about Dubai and
the UAE [United Arab Emirates], except that there’s a constant refrain
of: that’s the jurisdiction that accepted Binance, and so we don’t trust
their standards.</p>
<p>It was unclear to Sam, if Dubai decided to rid itself of CZ and his
exchange, whether any country in which CZ would be willing to live would
accept them. In these woods, CZ was the biggest bear and Sam seemed to
be going out of his way to poke him. Dubai was tiny, Houston with
sheikhs. Sam’s bid to turn CZ into a homeless fugitive was bound to get
back to him. And yet Sam didn’t leave it at that. On October 30, when he
returned to the Bahamas he tweeted a joke about CZ’s inability to shape
US crypto regulations. “Uh, he is still allowed to go to DC, right?”</p>
<p>Three days later, on November 2, the crypto news site CoinDesk
published an article about a curious document that appeared to have been
leaked to them by someone inside Alameda Research, or perhaps someone
who lent money to Alameda Research. It wasn’t a formal balance sheet.
There was no sign that it had been audited, or that it presented a
complete picture of the contents of Alameda Research, or that it was
even real. It listed 4.6 billion of assets and billion of liabilities
that were supposedly inside of Alameda Research as of June 30, 2022.
What the CoinDesk piece wanted to highlight was that more than a third
of the assets were FTT, the token FTX had issued three years
earlier.</p>
<p>In and of itself the article struck people inside FTX as of no more
than prurient interest.fn1 Everyone noticed that one of its contributors
was the current girlfriend of Eric Mannes, Caroline Ellison’s former
boyfriend at Jane Street. The previous month, the couple had visited the
Bahamas and stayed with employees of Alameda Research at Albany: Had the
leak somehow originated inside the company? There was also the frisson
that came with catching even a glimpse of the dragon’s hoard. But the
piece did not alarm or even surprise anyone at FTX. FTT was, in effect,
equity in FTX—it had a claim on the first third of FTX’s revenues. FTX
had generated a billion dollars in revenue in 2021 and, even with crypto
prices crashing, was about to do it again in 2022. Sam’s biggest regret,
expressed repeatedly from the moment the price of FTT had rocketed back
in 2019, was that he’d created and sold it in the first place. Ever
since, he’d been vacuuming it up inside of Alameda Research.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, November 6, CZ posted a tweet to his 7.3 million
followers.</p>
<p>CZ still held the roughly 00 million worth of FTT that he had taken
back in mid-2021 as part of his .275 billion buyout. (Most of the rest
of his massive payout he’d taken in bitcoin and dollars, though he also
took back roughly 00 million of the Binance token, BNB, that he’d used
to buy his stake in the first place.) Sam hadn’t thought much more about
the tweet than he had about the CoinDesk article. On Saturday, November
5, he and his brother, Gabe, along with Ryan Salame, had met in Palm
Beach with Florida governor Ron DeSantis. The meeting had no particular
purpose. Like basically everyone else in US politics and finance,
DeSantis wanted to meet Sam, and Sam was curious to know more about this
person who might well one day ask him for money. “It was to figure out
where he was on the scale from reasonable person to Trump,” said Sam.
“But I couldn’t figure it out.” After the meeting, he was scheduled to
fly to Tampa to watch Tom Brady’s Buccaneers play the Los Angeles Rams
the following day. It turned out to be thrilling, with Brady leading yet
another last-minute game-winning touchdown drive. Only Gabe and Ryan
Salame watched it, however, as by then Sam was back in the Bahamas, to
play the end of another game.</p>
<p>The run on FTX was in its own way spectacular. There had been 5
billion in customer deposits on the exchange. Or there was meant to be
that amount, held in either fiat currency or bitcoin and ether. On a
normal day, 0 million or so either came into or left the exchange. Each
day between November 1 and November 5, 00 million fled. By late Sunday
night, the sixth, 00 million was leaving every hour. FTX customers
withdrew billion that day, and then tried to withdraw another billion on
Monday. By Tuesday morning, billion had exited, and the exchange was
clearly not going to be able to come up with enough cash to pay the
swelling number of customers who wanted their money back. It didn’t
formally shut down withdrawals, but it more or less stopped actually
sending money back to the customers.</p>
<p>Even more interesting than the speed of the event were its inciting
incidents. CZ’s tweet had obviously been the first, but it wasn’t the
last, or maybe even the most important. Caroline had responded to CZ on
Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The tone—the peppy simplicity that obviously masked some other
motive—sounded a lot like Sam. Caroline had actually written it. Neither
she nor Sam expected CZ to accept the deal. CZ wanted to maximize the
damage to FTX, and so would string out the uncertainty for as long as
possible. The hope was that a concrete offer to buy at a certain price
would shut him up and calm the market.</p>
<p>It did the opposite. A risk analysis company called Gauntlet, which
studied the price movements of various crypto tokens, had maybe the best
picture of what actually happened next. Within twenty seconds of
Caroline’s tweet came a rush to sell FTT by speculators who had borrowed
money to buy it. The panic was driven by an assumption: if Alameda
Research, the single biggest owner of FTT, was making a big show of
being willing to buy a huge pile of it for 2, they must need for some
reason to maintain the market price at 2. The most plausible explanation
was that Alameda Research was using FTT as collateral to borrow dollars
or bitcoin from others. “You don’t tell someone a price level like 2
unless you have a lot of confidence that you need that price,” the CEO
of Gauntlet, Tarun Chitra, told Bloomberg News. By Monday night, the
price of FTT had fallen from 2 to . The half a billion dollars of his
own money that CZ had elected to incinerate was, in the grand scheme of
things, such a trivial sum that hardly anyone paid it any more
attention.</p>
<p>By Tuesday, the relevant math was fourth-grade level. Before the
crisis, FTX was meant to be holding about 5 billion worth of customer
deposits.fn2 Five billion of that had already been paid out to
customers, and so, still inside FTX, there should have been roughly 0
billion. There wasn’t. The only remaining assets were whatever was left
of the dragon’s hoard inside of Alameda: a big pile of FTT, another big
pile of Solana tokens, an assortment of crypto tokens that would be even
harder to sell, 00 million worth of Bahamas real estate, and a truly
massive heap of Sam’s venture capital investments—including the stake in
Twitter, which Sam had never bothered to sell. There was still perhaps
as much as billion worth of hard currency and bitcoin that they had yet
to return to customers—but the vast majority of the secret stash had no
immediate market. Much of what Caroline and Sam went back and forth
about the first two or three days of the run on FTX was just this.
Caroline, who by then was beaming in from the Hong Kong office, would
appear on a video call. Sam would go down the list of the many things
either he or she had bought and ask: How long will it take you to sell
this? For most, the answer was too long.</p>
<p>On the night of November 6, Sam had called Ramnik and asked him to
come to his Albany unit to talk about how they might find money. Sam had
actually called him twice, in the space of twenty minutes, and Sam never
called twice. The next hour left Ramnik triply confused. He thought that
Sam was in Florida, watching Tom Brady play football. He thought that
Sam lived not alone, on the ground floor of Gemini, but in the Orchid
penthouse, with the other effective altruists. (Like almost everyone
else inside FTX, he still had no idea that Sam and Caroline had been in
a relationship.) Above all, Ramnik did not know why Sam so urgently
needed money. Ramnik could see that money was leaving FTX, but he didn’t
view it as a big deal. The customers might panic and pull out all their
money. But once they realized that there was nothing to panic about,
they’d return, and their money would too.</p>
<p>Ramnik had always wanted to walk to work, and now he did. He left his
place (Cube 1B) and strolled around the Albany marina, past the sleeping
megayachts. They all had names that sounded like inside jokes or bad
puns. Special K. Pipe Dream. Fanta Sea. It was curious how few people
were ever around. Even in the day, there were more boats than people; at
night, the entire resort felt vacant. It was a place where rich people
bought homes they didn’t need because that’s what rich people were
supposed to do.</p>
<p>Entering Sam’s unit in Gemini, he found only effective altruists.
Nishad was in the living room, Caroline was on a video screen, and Sam
was headed to his bedroom to lie down. Sam wasn’t exactly incoherent so
much as he was difficult to talk to. Nishad was agitated with Sam in a
way that Ramnik had never seen—at one point turning on him and
screaming, “Will you please fucking stop playing Storybook Brawl?!”
Nothing any of them was saying made sense to Ramnik. Though Caroline was
in charge of Alameda Research, she seemed totally clueless about where
its money was. She’d come onto the screen and announce that she had
found 00 million here, or 00 million there, as if she’d just made an
original scientific discovery. Some guy at Deltec, their bank in the
Bahamas, messaged Ramnik to say, Oh, by the way, you have 00 million
with us. And it came as a total surprise to all of them!</p>
<p>Eventually Ramnik gathered that they needed to raise billion, fast,
to fill what they thought might be a billion hole. (The exact number
shifted around a lot those first few days.) To his obvious question—Why
was there a hole in the first place?—Sam and Nishad and Caroline offered
fuzzy answers. Gary sat quietly off to one side.</p>
<p>Ramnik had sat at the desk beside Gary for six months. “He’d come,
sit down, start working, work twelve hours straight. Not a word on the
way in, not a word on the way out,” said Ramnik. Gary usually didn’t
arrive until early afternoon, but one day he’d turned up at eleven in
the morning, and Ramnik had used the fact to try to start a
conversation.</p>
<p>“You’re in early today,” said Ramnik. “It’s only eleven o’clock.”</p>
<p>“And that too in the a.m.,” said Gary.</p>
<p>That was the only exchange they’d ever had, and Gary didn’t look as
if he was hoping for another. Sam, as usual, was doing most of the
talking. If at that moment you had asked Ramnik what he thought Sam knew
or did not know, he would have said that Sam actually didn’t know what
had happened. That he’d been taken by surprise. He wondered: If these
people knew there was a risk that they might not have enough money, why
hadn’t they even bothered to figure out how much they had? They’d done
nothing.</p>
<p>The next day, after lunch, an FTX lawyer named Can Sun appeared. Sam
had summoned Can for the same reason he’d summoned Ramnik—to talk to
investors and help him raise billion. Can, too, was perplexed. “They
wouldn’t answer questions directly about where the money went,” he said.
“When I entered the room, no one acknowledged that money was being
mishandled. The money was all there. We just had a liquidity issue.” Sam
and Can and Ramnik and others called everyone on the planet who might be
able to deliver billion quickly: sovereign wealth funds, private equity
funds, Asian crypto exchanges. As it turned out, it wasn’t easy to get
people to give you billion when you couldn’t explain why you needed it.
It was even harder to get people to give you billion when you had to
have it right away. Lots of people were willing to talk to Sam and Can
and Ramnik, but all of them had the same question: Where did the
customer deposits go? When that question went unanswered, everyone who
had billion lying around lost interest.</p>
<p>From the universe of people with that kind of money to spare, only
one person stepped forward to say he might be willing to spare it: CZ.
For obvious reasons, CZ was the last person Sam wanted to call and beg
for money. Sam did not call CZ until Tuesday. “I called CZ and he’s
pissed,” said Sam. “So I started groveling. Three hours later we had an
LOI [letter of intent] signed.” The agreement gave Binance the entire
company, minus FTX US, in exchange for assuming its liabilities. It also
gave Binance the right to inspect the books of both FTX and Alameda
Research, such as they were. It positioned CZ as the first outsider on
the planet to see into the dragon’s lair and to know, or appear to know,
exactly what had happened inside both FTX and Alameda Research.</p>
<p>The following evening, Wednesday, November 9, CZ said that whatever
he’d seen had caused him to change his mind. Sam learned the news from a
tweet:</p>
<p>That’s when everyone who hadn’t already crept away bolted for the
airport. They all had their reasons for their feelings of urgency.
Nishad was speaking more of killing himself. Can’s wife told him that if
he didn’t leave right away, she would file for divorce. Ramnik, who had
thought himself a behind-the-scenes guy, invisible to the outside world,
was receiving death threats. He was relieved to have never been told
that money that should have been inside FTX was actually inside Alameda.
It crossed his mind that his wife had saved him—because everyone would
have known that to tell him was also to tell her. The effective
altruists might have expanded their circle of trust by one, he thought,
but not two.</p>
<p>By Wednesday evening, the trust was vanishing even inside the small
circle of effective altruists. Caroline remained almost upbeat, and even
tried to explain to Sam why. “I just had an increasing dread of this day
that was weighing on me for a long time and now that it’s actually
happening it just feels great to get it over with one way or another,”
she’d written to him on Sunday. In the wee hours of Tuesday, Bahamas
time, she followed it up with another message: “Feel weirdly good to get
it over with. I’ve been dreading this for a long time so feels like a
big weight off my shoulders.” The next day, four hours before CZ tweeted
his change of heart about buying FTX, she addressed her subordinates in
the Hong Kong office. “I think I’ll just start by saying some stuff, and
feel free to ask questions?” she began, with a nervous giggle.</p>
<p>Caroline thought in periods but spoke in question marks and
exclamation points. She made the sounds of uptalk and uncertainty while
delivering a message that was brutally simple: they were bankrupt. She
didn’t go into a lot of detail about how it had happened but did say
that Alameda had suffered losses back in June, when their biggest crypto
lenders had also asked for their money back. At that time, Alameda had
“borrowed” from FTX to repay its lenders. Now that they had sold—as far
as she knew—FTX to CZ, Alameda would likely cease to exist. “Mostly I
want to say I’m sorry?” she said. “This really sucks. It’s really not
fair to you guys.” She understood that people might not want to stick
around to help clean up whatever mess needed cleaning up, but “for
people who do stick around it’s possible there’s some future thing.” She
concluded on a hopeful note, about the deal with CZ. “Repaying all of
our creditors and making sure Alameda didn’t go bankrupt is probably,
like, good?”</p>
<p>“Can you say how big the hole is?” asked one of the traders in the
audience, when she was done.</p>
<p>Caroline said she’d rather not.</p>
<p>“Is it closer to one billion or six billion?” he pressed.</p>
<p>“The, uh, latter?” said Caroline.</p>
<p>After her talk, Caroline approached a female employee and said
brightly, If you want to stay and help, I’d really appreciate it!</p>
<p>Fuck you, the woman had said.</p>
<p>While Caroline happily made the case for her guilt, Nishad was
unhappily searching for evidence of his innocence. At the start of the
crisis, he seemed mostly concerned that the effective altruist dream had
died and that he, and anyone else who had borrowed money from FTX, would
soon be bankrupt, as they had no assets and still owed money to the
company. At four in the morning on Monday, he texted Caroline, i’m sad
about the reflection of this on ea. By Wednesday, November 9, his mind
had turned to his legal peril. “This is wildly selfish of me but they
may need to know it wasn’t a ton of people orchestrating it,” he
messaged Sam, without specifying who “they” were or what “it” was. He
followed it with another message: “Can you make it you, or you and Gary
who people blame?” And then a third: “I think I need to tell Zane that I
wasn’t aware in orchestrating it.”</p>
<p>That night, Nishad requested a meeting with just Gary and Sam. Once
the three were alone in a room, Nishad asked, What happens if law
enforcement or regulators reach out?</p>
<p>What do you mean? Sam asked.</p>
<p>How do we make sure we cooperate in prisoner’s dilemma? How do we all
make sure we say the other ones are innocent?</p>
<p>I don’t have any reason to think any one of us had criminal intent,
said Sam.</p>
<p>No, said Nishad. That’s not good enough. You need to talk to them.
You need to tell them I had no clue.</p>
<p>How could I know that? asked Sam. You are saying that I should say
that you know nothing about something I know nothing about. How is that
even possible? It makes no sense.</p>
<p>But I didn’t know, said Nishad.</p>
<p>Then say that, said Sam.</p>
<p>It’s not going to work for me, said Nishad. Because there is
code-based evidence of what I did.fn3</p>
<p>From start to finish, Gary just watched, as he’d done the entire
week. He never said a word. It was as if he had made an expected value
calculation of whatever he might say and decided that words still did
not pay.</p>
<p>On Friday, Nishad was gone, which was just as well, as by then the
police in the Bahamas were preparing to arrest any remaining leaders.
That afternoon, roughly 50 million in crypto vanished from the wallets
inside FTX. No one knew who the hacker was; everyone just assumed it was
an inside job; lots of people suspected Sam and Gary. That evening, when
Sam called Caroline, she didn’t pick up. And never again would.</p>
<p>In the middle of all this, the woman responsible for the presence in
the Bahamas of all the characters in the drama intervened. Christina
Rolle, the Bahamas chief financial regulator, was genuinely shocked by
how quickly the financial ecosystem that had grown around Sam and become
populated with opportunists who had done very well off of him had
collapsed—and by how those very people who had taken his money were
turning on him without knowing exactly what he’d done. So long as Sam
was giving away money to everyone, people loved him and nobody asked too
many questions; the moment he was losing money, they turned on him—and
didn’t want to hear his answers to the questions they asked him. She
found it troubling that the police were setting out to arrest people
before anyone had any idea what they’d done. No authority had yet spoken
to Sam, or to any of the other leaders of FTX and Alameda. All anyone
knew was what they read on Twitter. They had no evidence to charge
anyone with a crime: in the Bahamas, fraud required intent, and the
intent here was unclear. Without explicit charges, anyone they arrested
could be held only for so long.</p>
<p>The other reason she didn’t want Sam and Gary arrested was that she
needed their help to understand what had happened. Sam hadn’t returned
her calls all week. On Wednesday afternoon, she finally had a Zoom with
Ryan Salame, who though still co-CEO of FTX had remained in the United
States after Tom Brady’s game, and Ryne Miller, the lawyer for FTX’s US
business. They told her that money had been moved from FTX into Alameda
but that they didn’t know how or why it had happened. “I found it funny
that someone who was the CEO had this level of understanding that was
not good,” said Rolle.</p>
<p>It was an odd moment. All these people inside FTX suddenly wanted to
seem to know less than they did, and all these people outside FTX
thought that they knew more than they actually did. On Twitter, in the
blink of an eye, a rumor became a fact, the fact became a story, and the
story became an explanation. Sam had made off with billions and was
already on the run. Sam was in Dubai or some other place that lacked an
extradition treaty with the United States. Someone posted videos of a
man alleged to be Sam wandering the streets of Buenos Aires. Christina
Rolle didn’t think Sam was going to run, and she didn’t think he was
hiding billions. Her biggest worry about him was that when she asked him
questions, he wouldn’t give her straight answers. “I don’t think he
knows why people don’t trust him,” she said. “It’s not hard to see you
are being played by him, like a board game.”</p>
<p>On Thursday she froze FTX’s assets and effectively threw the company
into liquidation, the Bahamas version of bankruptcy. On Friday—the day
of my arrival—Sam’s father, Joe, had dropped Sam at the old FTX offices
to meet with the Bahamas liquidators. Three hours later, they were
finished with Sam for the day. Rolle asked him to meet with her the next
day at police headquarters. She wanted to question Gary, too, but the
liquidators needed him to secure the exchange’s assets, and so she’d put
that off until the following Monday. After grilling Sam for several
hours, Rolle climbed into a car with her assistant, who had observed the
interaction. The assistant began to cry. “You cannot let them arrest
this man,” she’d pleaded. Rolle hadn’t. She’d persuaded the police to
take away Sam’s and Gary’s passports instead. And that was why, when I
rolled into the FTX parking lot with Natalie, I found Sam, alone but
still at large, walking in circles.</p>
<p>By Friday night there were only two people still waiting to exit the
stage and leave it to others to find the meaning of the play. The first
was Zane Tackett. I’d heard that Zane might still be around and found
him the next day, Saturday, November 12. Zane had done something no one
else had done: when the shooting started, he’d run toward the fight
rather than away from it. The previous Sunday, he’d been at a crypto
conference in Lisbon, about to leave for Abu Dhabi, where FTX was
sponsoring a Formula 1 race. He was now walking back and forth across
the marble floors of a unit inside Albany, shifting clothes from a dryer
into a bag and drinking a bottle of rum.</p>
<p>From the start, Zane had been enthralled by Sam, and by the empire he
might create. But he hadn’t signed up to the cause blindly. Before
joining FTX, he’d consulted his old friends in crypto. CZ was one of
them. “It was CZ who told me about him,” he now recalled. “He said, ‘I
think that’d be a really good option for you.’ People have asked me,
‘How did you come to trust Sam so much?’ CZ was the start of it. But
nobody had a bad thing to say about him.” Zane was the gunslinger who’d
been talked into making a respectable home in the town alongside what
appeared to be law-abiding folk. Lots of big crypto speculators had
entrusted their money to FTX because they trusted Zane.</p>
<p>Those people had had their doubts over the past two weeks, of course.
They read Twitter too. But on Sunday, when things began to unravel, Zane
had asked Sam for orders, and Sam had told him to reassure everyone. “I
pinged Sam and asked, ‘Should I do damage control?’ ‘Yup,’ he said.”
Zane then sent Sam a message asking three questions: “One, are we
insolvent, two, did we ever lend out customer funds to Alameda, and
three anything I didn’t ask that I need to know?” Sam didn’t reply—and
then went totally silent on him. He’d vanished on Zane in the same way
he’d vanished on Christina Rolle.</p>
<p>Still, Zane figured there was no way that FTX was in real trouble. It
made no sense. The price of FTT shouldn’t have any effect on the value
of the exchange, any more than the price of Apple stock should have on
Apple’s iPhone sales. Just the reverse: the exchange’s revenues drove
the value of FTT. “If FTT goes to zero, so what?” said Zane. The other
reason it made no sense was that FTX had been so wildly profitable. “I
know how much real revenue we were making: two bips [0.02 percent] on
two hundred fifty billion dollars a month,” said Zane. “I’m like, Dude,
you were sitting on a fucking printing press: why did you need to do
this?”</p>
<p>Right up until late Monday night, Zane had been telling his friends
that everything was okay. The money that fled the exchange belonged to
the people who felt nothing for it; the money that remained, at least
some of it, belonged to people who shared Zane’s principled belief that
you stuck by your allies through thick and thin. “That fucking
asshole—how could he not tell me, when I went out to defend him?” said
Zane, repeating more or less what he’d said to Sam directly. “You let me
go out and lie for you. Fuck you.”</p>
<p>He was so different from the effective altruists. He didn’t have
Sam’s interest in How to Think About Bob. If Bob was Zane’s good friend,
and Zane had no evidence that Bob had committed the unsolved murder,
Zane would have insisted on thinking about Bob the way he had always
thought about Bob. He would have gone out of his way to stand by Bob,
and to make Bob feel better about what had happened. But if he’d
stumbled upon Bob burying a bloody knife in his backyard he’d have shot
him on the spot, without even pausing to update his probabilities. Or at
least that’s how I still imagine Zane.</p>
<p>He’d quit on Tuesday. Now he was on his way to Miami, and from there
he wasn’t sure where he’d go. Whatever trail he took, he wasn’t going to
waste time on it trying to figure out why Sam had done whatever he’d
done. To Zane it didn’t matter. There was one question he dwelled on:
Why had neither he nor anyone else he knew seen this coming? He had the
beginning of an answer. “Sam’s oddness,” he said. “His oddness mixed
with just how smart he was allowed you to wave away a lot of the
concerns. The question of why just goes away.”</p>
<p>There remained the question of who would pass legal judgment on Sam
and the others, and who would clean up their mess. The Bahamas had moved
to put FTX into liquidation the day before Sam signed the papers
declaring bankruptcy in the United States. Alameda Research and the
small US exchange were incorporated in Delaware. FTX’s bigger
international crypto exchange, where the vast majority of the trading
occurred, had been created in Hong Kong. Incorporated in Antigua and now
headquartered in the Bahamas, the main crypto exchange forbade US
citizens from using it and worked fairly hard to keep them from doing
so. Any US citizens who happened to be trading on it had lied their way
onto it. There was a decent argument to be made that judgment of Sam,
and liquidation of FTX, should occur in the Bahamas. There was a less
decent argument, made by US bankruptcy lawyers who stood to make a
fortune from the case, that all the assets and the people meant to be
tending them should be moved to the United States. And there was a third
argument, made by Sam, that anything that happened would need to happen
wherever Gary was, because Gary was the only one who could explain the
code that had governed the business. “At the end of the day, the
deciding factor in the jurisdictional dispute is Gary,” said Sam, the
night Zane left, “because he’s the only one who knows how to use a
computer.”</p>
<p>Gary was the last person to leave. He pulled Sam aside in the Orchid
penthouse. And he actually spoke, albeit very briefly.</p>
<p>I talked to my lawyer and I’m going to leave, he said.</p>
<p>Is there anything to say that would be relevant here? asked Sam.</p>
<p>The lawyer told me to leave, and I have to leave, said Gary.fn4</p>
<p>That was it. Gary never said when he would leave, or how he would
leave—which was an issue, as the Bahamas had taken his passport. On
Sunday night, without a further word to anyone, he just slipped,
unnoticed, out of the Orchid penthouse. The lawyer who spirited him off
arranged with US authorities to supply him with a second passport, so
that they might smuggle him back to the United States before the
government of the Bahamas knew what had happened. Christina Rolle never
had a chance to speak with him.</p>
