<p>2: THE SANTA CLAUS PROBLEM</p>
<p>fn1 From a blog Sam wrote as a college sophomore, but he’d made this
argument as a high school junior.</p>
<p>fn2 Matt grew up to be an inventor of games. He created Storybook
Brawl.</p>
<p>fn3 These events were overwhelmingly male. Populated by a certain
kind of guy. It tells you something about Magic culture that tournament
rules eventually included standards of personal hygiene, after players
began to weaponize their body odor.</p>
<p>fn4 Same sophomore college blog. In this case, the thoughts date back
to the seventh grade.</p>
<p>3: META GAMES</p>
<p>fn1 Jane Street Capital, like the other high-frequency trading firms,
felt very strongly that it was better off if the public did not know
what it did. “The first time a New York Times piece appeared about them,
there was like a nuclear meltdown,” recalled one former Jane Street
employee—who, like the other ten current and former Jane Street
employees who helped me to understand what went on there, prefers to
remain unidentified.</p>
<p>fn2 He’d later change it to Will MacAskill, so I’ll do that here
too.</p>
<p>fn3 Sam’s email address was a Fibonacci sequence, a set of numbers
each of which, beginning with the third number, is the sum of the
preceding two. 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13, and so on.</p>
<p>4: THE MARCH OF PROGRESS</p>
<p>fn1 Which told you something about Jane Street. In 2104, the year Sam
joined Jane Street, Virtu Financial applied to the US Securities and
Exchange Commission to sell shares to the public. Its prospectus
revealed that in 1,238 days of trading, it had had exactly one losing
day. It had just ended a year in which it had made money trading in the
stock market every day. How does any firm do that? the reader might
intelligently wonder. The answer is outside the scope of this story but
is partly addressed in a book I wrote in 2014, called Flash Boys. The
point here is that while the high-frequency trading firms appeared
interchangeable from a certain distance—their trading was automated,
they all acted as intermediaries in financial markets—they differed in
how they made their money. Firms like Virtu and Citadel paid US stock
exchanges for speed advantages that enabled them to trade against others
in the market with very little risk, which explained why they never lost
money. They ended each trading day without any positions in the market.
Their skill, such as it was, was to create a faster picture of the stock
market for themselves than others were able to—which was why, when they
went looking for young talent, they wanted computer programmers who
could speed their machines more than traders who could make risk
decisions. Jane Street had never gotten seriously into the US stock
market speed games, and perhaps regretted it. Its relative strength had
always been in arguably fairer markets, where they couldn’t simply buy
the advantages offered to high-frequency traders by, say, the New York
Stock Exchange. If firms like Virtu and Citadel were playing a speed
game, firms like Jane Street were playing a brain game.</p>
<p>5: HOW TO THINK ABOUT BOB</p>
<p>fn1 By late 2017, Berkeley had replaced Oxford as the financial
capital of effective altruism. One reason for this was that Facebook
cofounder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife, Cari Tuna, signaled their
intent to give away most of their multibillion-dollar fortune to
effective altruist causes—but there were others. Oxford was still the
movement’s intellectual center, but the Bay Area had become the most
likely place to raise the money needed to start what amounted to an
effective altruist hedge fund.</p>
<p>fn2 According to CoinMarketCap, 2,177 different coins were in
circulation by the end of 2018. In value they ranged from bitcoin, with
a market cap of around 0 billion, to a token called SHADE, with a market
cap of just under twenty dollars. The different coins at least pretended
to serve some special purpose or project: their creators usually issued
what amounted to a mission statement. Sexcoin, for example, claimed to
want to make it easier for people to buy sex toys. PUTinCoin said it was
supporting the Russian economy and “was created to pay tribute to the
Russian people and their president.” Hot Potato was the best and, in a
way, the most honest. A pure gambling mechanism, it self-destructed in
thirty days.</p>
<p>6: ARTIFICIAL LOVE</p>
<p>fn1 That’s it for crypto explanations for the moment, as that’s about
all that Sam Bankman-Fried knew about crypto, or for that matter needed
to know, to trade billions of dollars’ worth of it. Plus, so many
writers have taken a crack at explaining to a lay audience what a
bitcoin is that it’s hard to see the point of doing it all over again.
See, for example, Matt Levine’s excellent forty-thousand-word article in
Bloomberg Businessweek, “The Crypto Story.” What is curious is how
elusive Bitcoin is, as a thing to understand. Bitcoin often gets
explained but somehow never stays explained. You nod along and think you
are getting it but then wake up the next morning needing to hear the
explanation all over again.</p>
<p>fn2 True at the time. The opposite of true now, as crypto sleuths
have built the tools to exploit the fact that every bitcoin transaction
is preserved for all time on the blockchain.</p>
<p>fn3 There was the other point of view to consider, of course—how
these venture capitalists viewed this odd new crypto entrepreneur. “I
got on the phone with him,” recalled Nick Shalek, of Ribbit Capital. “I
asked him a question. And he talked for an hour. I asked him a second
question, and he talked for another hour.” Shalek was struck, as were
many of the VCs, by Sam’s seeming artlessness. “He says if he has a
decision to make and the decision is a million-dollar decision, he’ll
make it in five seconds. If it’s a ten-million-dollar decision, he’ll
take a few minutes, and if it’s a hundred-million-dollar decision, he’ll
spend a couple of hours on it. And it’s like he’s serious? I’m thinking,
God, you can’t say that to a regulator, or a journalist … or anyone.”
This artless workaholic was plotting to take over the financial
world—and had a plausible story about how he might do it. “For him to
build the business he was describing, it would be the largest global
crypto exchange and then go beyond that—to become the largest global
financial institution,” said Shalek. He, like everyone else, quickly saw
that Sam didn’t resemble most of the entrepreneurs he’d dealt with.
“He’s not a showman. He’s not a salesman. He’s got a nonconventional way
of thinking about building his organization. Everything is
probabilities, and he’d pull these probabilities out of thin air. And
then he’d change them. He’s sleeping on a beanbag. He’s doing all of
this by himself. And he doesn’t seem particularly interested in our
opinion on anything. Which is fine. But we were like, He’s an unusual
person. We have to spend time with him in person.” But they couldn’t
spend time with Sam in person. The Hong Kong government had responded to
the global pandemic by requiring anyone who entered the country to
quarantine in a hotel for fourteen days. Sam was understood and
interpreted by his original investors mostly via Zoom, and in the middle
of one of the great venture capital booms in history.</p>
<p>7: THE ORG CHART</p>
<p>fn1 This is a footnote. And so it will feel on the page as it did at
the time in real life: like a distraction from the story. But there’s a
backstory, and a person, you need to know about to grasp the spirit of
the enterprise and to understand what is to come. Back in the 1970s, the
Bahamas had been slow to create regulations for the insurance industry,
and had lost out on a massive potential economic opportunity when a
booming reinsurance industry set itself up in Bermuda, whose regulators
had moved more quickly. By remaining entirely dependent on cruise ship
tourism, the Bahamas had paid a price and run a risk—which became a
reality when Covid stopped all cruise ships and torpedoed the economy.
Back in 2015, a woman named Christina Rolle took over the job of chief
financial regulator: executive director of the Securities Commission of
The Bahamas. Her defining trait was her lack of self-importance. She was
quiet and thoughtful and curious about the world—and aware that
financial services offered the Bahamas one of the few ways to expand its
middle class. By late 2018, she’d heard enough PowerPoint talks from
financial regulators at international conferences to realize that
everyone was avoiding dealing with crypto. She set out to do what US
regulators have so far not done: sit down and write the rules to
legalize much of crypto finance. “The technology is not going to go
away,” she said. “And what is going to happen with it is going to
disrupt financial services in ways we cannot see.” She was aware of the
risk: you write the regulation to allow some financial activity, and you
never know who is going to show up or what they will do. “We had no one
in mind, no one,” she said. “We didn’t know who was going to come. And I
thought initially, Bahamas being so small, no one is going to be
recognizing it right away, but at least we’d be a player in the market.”
Then, out of the blue, in the late summer of 2021, the founder of the
world’s hottest crypto exchange had turned up and made Christina Rolle
look like a genius. She remained wary. “My fear is that I’ll wake up one
morning and there will be a big headline that I didn’t see coming,” she
said, in early 2022. “Because there are so many people watching from the
wings and waiting to say ‘I told you so.’ There are a lot of crypto
skeptics out there.” Hold that thought.</p>
<p>fn2 Steph Curry had at first declined but then changed his mind. Much
later, it would be reported that Taylor Swift had turned down FTX’s
money. That wasn’t quite true. FTX had an agreement with Swift to pay
her between 5 and 0 million a year, but Sam dragged his feet on the
deal. “She wanted to do it,” said Natalie Tien, “but Sam kept postponing
on response to her team.” Another person intimately involved with the
negotiation between Swift and FTX said, “Taylor did not turn it down.
They were waiting for Sam to sign it when he didn’t.”</p>
<p>fn3 There was a price to hiring Tom Brady, over and above the 5
million they paid him, but at the time it seemed trivial: the bundled
9.8 million deal with Gisele Bündchen. With Gisele came a celebrity
campaign, complete with a fashion marketing consultant, who quickly spun
up her own ideas without a whole lot of supervision. It was through the
consultant that, without Sam quite understanding how it happened, he
found himself on the Zoom call with Anna Wintour, trying to figure out
which Met the gala was in. Soon his face was plastered in fashion
magazine spreads and at bus stops around the country—after which he
fired the fashion marketing consultant. “It was all part of the
celebrity deal with Gisele,” said Natalie Tien, who by then was running
Sam’s media life. “Very cringe. No one at FTX liked the idea, including
Sam himself.”</p>
<p>fn4 FTX also bought a fleet of maybe sixty vehicles. “I’d bought Sam
a BMW,” said Ryan. “He made me return it. I was like, ‘Sam you’re worth
forty billion dollars. And these are bumpy roads.’ But whatever.”</p>
<p>8: THE DRAGON’S HOARD</p>
<p>fn1 On a podcast, Flynn took the side of an alt-right group called
Timber Unity in its complaints about what it saw as excessive
restrictions on economic activity in the habitat of an endangered
species, the northern spotted owl. “You have these people in the city
who were like, ‘Oh, look. There’s an owl. Isn’t it cool?’” said Flynn.
“‘We’re gonna destroy all of your livelihoods in your community because
we like this owl’ … You know, it’s like it’s saying, like, ‘Oh, I like
this exhibit in the zoo more than everyone you know.’” A lot of those
people in the city turned out to be the voters in his election.</p>
<p>fn2 Both Eric Greitens and Eric Schmitt instantly claimed to have
Trump’s endorsement, and thus Trump’s influence was neutralized. Eric
Schmitt wound up winning the primary and the general election, and now
sits in the US Senate.</p>
<p>9: THE VANISHING</p>
<p>fn1 Even informed outsiders were not all that surprised. Steve
Ehrlich, the Forbes reporter who had been assigned to determine Sam’s
wealth, said that he said to himself when he saw the piece,
Congratulations on knowing something we knew two years ago.</p>
<p>fn2 I’m simplifying this, though only a tiny bit. FTX was a futures
exchange, and so it lent money to its customers to make bets. At any
given moment, it would not be expected to have all of its customers’
money immediately on hand. But its chief selling point back in 2019 was
that it had found a better way to evaluate the gambles of the customers
to whom it lent money; and it had. And so it should not have been
exposed to losses from its loans to customers.</p>
<p>fn3 The reader is right to wonder how I know any of this. Or, as Sam
might put it, What is the probability that any of this is true? The
conversation comes from Sam’s memory soon after. The rest of the account
of the crisis was confirmed by others in Sam’s sleeping quarters. I’m
not sure how that affects the various probability calculations, but
anything I didn’t think happened I would not have included. What any of
it means is another matter.</p>
<p>fn4 This one I witnessed from a distance. It felt like a kind of
miracle.</p>
<p>10: MANFRED</p>
<p>fn1 Sam said much the same thing to me. “No one ever asked about the
risk engine,” he said. “I don’t know what I would have done if asked. I
would have done one of two things. Either I would have answered a
different question, or I would have made a word salad.”</p>
<p>fn2 The institutions that stepped up to bank crypto wound up paying a
huge price. Of the four that collapsed in the spring 2023 run on
regional US banks, three were the earliest bankers of crypto firms:
Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Capital, and Signature Bank. The fourth,
First Republic Bank, was not important in the crypto financial ecosystem
but did have an account with 00,000 in it in the name of Sam
Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>fn3 The lawsuit filed against Binance by the SEC alleged, among other
things, that the world’s biggest crypto exchange used an internal
trading team to manipulate its volume and removed billions of dollars’
worth of customers’ money and sent it to a trading firm, owned by CZ,
called Merit Peak Limited.</p>
<p>fn4 It wasn’t. The document fell into the hands of reporters, who
forwarded it on to the committee. Members of the committee saw Sam’s
document. They agreed with his mother.</p>
<p>11: TRUTH SERUM</p>
<p>fn1 In the first seven months alone, the professional fees would top
00 million, with Sullivan andandandand Cromwell the top fee earner, and
they’d only just gotten started. A study made by one creditor projected
that by the time they were done, the various advisors to the bankruptcy
would have taken out a billion dollars.</p>
<p>fn2 They’d find her in a raid of her parents’ vacation house in New
Hampshire. She’d moved from Nassau to Nashua.</p>
<p>fn3 There was one of these, too, but it was as elusive as George’s
org chart. Natalie had given it to me but with a whisper that might
accompany the transfer of a classified document.</p>
<p>fn4 Former FTX employees were more skeptical of Ray’s sleuths. Sam’s
World controlled a great many virtual wallets, and you sort of had to
know what you were looking for to find them. “They have no idea what are
in these wallets,” said one former employee. “Even after five years,
they will not know.” As an example, he mentioned a collection of 101
Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, that Sam had bought
at auction for 4.4 million back in September 2021. They had not been on
Ray’s list of recovered assets. The former Hong Kong staff thought there
was a lot like that.</p>
<p>fn5 One of the lawyers responsible for at least one of the resulting
raids on FTX, Kyle Roche, would be fired by his firm after making a
video explaining how he shook down crypto companies that had actually
done nothing wrong. He’d claim that he had been drugged and tricked into
saying what he had. Another story for another day.</p>
<p>fn6 In a suit filed against Michael Kives for return of the 00
million Sam had invested in his K5 group of funds, Ray led with a dinner
party Kives hosted on February 11, 2022, attended by Sam. “True to
Kives’s reputation as a high-profile ‘super-networker,’” he wrote, “the
attendees at the dinner party included a former Presidential candidate,
top actors and musicians, reality TV stars and multiple billionaires.”
He then quoted from a memo he’d found, written by Sam, which described
Kives as “one-stop shop[ping] for relationships that we should utilize”
and a provider of “infinite connections.” I’d actually gone to that
dinner party with Sam. Neither of us, nor any of Sam’s colleagues, had
any idea who Kives was. The dinner party invitation had come more or
less out of the blue, along with a hint about the guest list. Sam was
going to be in Los Angeles anyway and decided (as always) last-minute to
see if it was real. He worried a bit how to pronounce the name of his
host. (He guessed it was KY-ves; it turned out to be KEE-vus.) His
employees worried that the invitation was a ruse to get Sam to a house
in Beverly Hills so that he might be kidnapped. Adam Jacobs followed in
a car with a small team and was ready to rush the house and save Sam if
he cried for help. In this spirit, and of course wearing cargo shorts,
Sam rolled into the home of a total stranger, only to be ushered to the
back lawn, where maybe sixty other guests had already gathered. Among
them: Hillary Clinton, Leonardo DiCaprio, Chris Rock, Katy Perry, Kate
Hudson, Orlando Bloom, Jeff Bezos, Doug Emhoff, and at least four
Kardashians. For a moment it seemed like a play drawn up by Fox News to
dramatize one of their arguments in the culture war—but then we spotted
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, a solid Republican, and Los Angeles
Rams owner “Silent Stan” Kroenke, who had donated a million bucks to
help pay for Trump’s inauguration. Sam pulled out his phone and texted
Jacobs: I think it’s real.</p>
<p>fn7 John Ray told me that it was not but did not supply evidence. An
employee of FTX US who worked on a small team that studied the question
in early November 2022 told me, “When we ran the calculation on the US
balance sheet, it was a solvent entity.”</p>
<p>fn8 And basically no one did, with one fabulous exception: Kevin
O’Leary. Say what you will about his influence, he’s got some nerve.</p>
