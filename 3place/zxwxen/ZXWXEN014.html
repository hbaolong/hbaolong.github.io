<h4 id="coda">Coda</h4>
<p>At the end of the week of the collapse and after everyone had fled,
George Lerner had gone into the office. Walking around, he finally came
to jungle hut 27 and Sam’s desk. That’s when he saw the toppled king.
Someone had taken the piece from an office chessboard and placed it
sideways on Sam’s keyboard. George had removed it but otherwise he’d
left the place untouched.</p>
<p>Six months later, it remained in nearly the same state. The Bahamas
liquidators had taken it over and used it for an office until they’d run
out of money, but it was as if their workers had been instructed to
preserve the place as you might a sacred burial ground. The framed Steph
Curry jersey still hung on the wall. The tchotchkes and coffee mugs and
even the eyeglasses of the former occupants remained on the desks
exactly where they had been when the volcano erupted. The shelves were
still packed with unhealthy vegan snacks, and FTX beer was still stacked
inside the refrigerators. “Brewed by pirates for pirates,” read the
sides of the cans.</p>
<p>To many of the former inhabitants it was all starting to feel as if
it had been a dream. Their experience had been so different from
experiences they’d had before in their lives that it was growing harder
to believe any of it had really happened. Collectively, they were
shaking themselves awake and getting back to whoever they had been
before they’d fallen asleep. You could see this happening in real time.
Even before she left the magical island, Constance Wang had begun the
process of syncing up her future with her life before the dream. “Do I
need a purpose?” she’d asked me. “Sam made me feel like I have a
purpose. Now I don’t know if I need a purpose. Or what my purpose should
be.”</p>
<p>I’d come back after they’d all gone, to look for something. After
searching the jungle huts I was prepared to agree with others that it,
too, had been no more than a figment of the imagination. But there was
one last place to check, an old storage unit that no one had bothered to
go through. The facility was just off the road that Sam drove every day
between the Albany resort and the jungle huts. To the naked eye, it
wasn’t a place you’d store anything of value, just lines carved in the
jungle by tired-looking buildings with corrugated metal fronts. But it
was there that I found it. It was just inside one of the ten unmarked
FTX sheds. The wooden crate had been addressed to Ryan Salame. It must
have been far too heavy to move farther into the unit, so they’d just
dumped it right at the front. The tungsten cube.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments</p>
<p>Elizabeth Riley and Jacob Weisberg read and commented upon parts of
this book. Will Bennett and Christina Ferguson researched crypto and
other questions and helped me to understand my subject better than I
ever could have on my own. Pamela Bain and Valdez Russell kept me
looking forward to yet another trip to the Bahamas. Nick Yee taught me
about games, and David Chee schooled me in Storybook Brawl. Janet Byrne
is still somehow considered my copyeditor, but with each book her
influence extends further into places that normal copyeditors never
reach. And I owe more than I can express here to my editors, Tom Penn
and, of course, Starling Lawrence.</p>
