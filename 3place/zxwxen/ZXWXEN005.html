<h4 id="meta-games">3 Meta Games</h4>
<p>After not much happening in the life of Sam Bankman-Fried for a very
long time, two big things occurred in the fall of 2012, at so nearly the
same time that it would soon be hard to remember that they had nothing
to do with each other. Sam had entered his junior year at MIT as just
another physics student who had lost his interest in physics.
Approximately zero of MIT’s physics majors became physicists anymore.
Most went to work for Google, or for high-frequency trading firms. Jump
Trading, Tower Research Capital, Hudson River Trading, Susquehanna
International Group, Wolverine Trading, Jane Street Capital: all these
Wall Street companies Sam had never heard of came to the job fair that
year inside the MIT gym. And he became just a little curious about
them.</p>
<p>Even a few months earlier his curiosity would have surprised him.
He’d never had the slightest interest in money. He neither knew nor
cared about finance. Apart from a firmly held idea that he should
evaluate his actions by their utilitarian effects, he had no clue what
to do with his life. He’d always just thought that he’d wind up being
some kind of professor, like his parents. “I had sort of implicitly
assumed that academia was the center of morality,” he said. “It was
where people were at least thinking of how to have the most impact on
the world.” Two years of college classes and the previous summer’s
internship, during which he’d helped MIT researchers with their
projects, had killed that assumption. During college lectures he’d
experienced a boredom that had the intensity of physical pain. He had no
ability to listen to a canned talk. He’d figure out where the professor
was going with whatever he was saying and, bang, he was out. The more
Sam saw of academic life, the more it felt like one long canned talk,
created mainly for narrow career purposes. “I sort of started to look at
it from a different perspective, and I got a little bit disillusioned,”
he said. “There was very little evidence that they were doing much of
anything to change the world. Or even thinking about how to have the
most impact on the world.”</p>
<p>Newly aware that he had no plan for the future, he’d gone to the job
fair, where he found all these booths run by Wall Street firms. He’d
never heard of any of them, but right away he could see that, whatever
they did, they weren’t all doing the same thing, because they were
looking for different kinds of people. Some advertised for “core
developers,” or “programmers,” while others were looking for “traders.”
Sam had no talent for coding—the two closest friends he’d made at MIT
were both coders, but he still couldn’t tell a good coder from a bad
coder. About trading all he knew was that he was not obviously
unqualified to do it. He dropped his résumé with the firms looking for
traders. It still felt like a lark. “Someone told me that a lot of
physics majors go to work on Wall Street, and I thought, Eh, maybe, but
probably not.”</p>
<p>He was surprised when three different high-frequency trading firms
emailed him to invite him to interview for their summer internships:
Susquehanna, Wolverine, and Jane Street Capital. “It turned out that
this was a real thing,” he said. Exactly what it was remained a mystery,
even after the firms had reached out to him. You couldn’t just google
“Jane Street Capital” and learn anything useful about the place. There
was hardly anything about Jane Street Capital on the internet.fn1 “I had
no idea what to expect,” said Sam. “I didn’t even know what types of
interviews these were going to be.”</p>
<p>He had three phone interviews with Jane Street traders, and they were
like no interviews he’d ever heard of. Something about his résumé must
have caught these people’s attention, but they didn’t seem to care about
anything on it. They didn’t ask him about what he was studying, or how
he’d spent his summer vacations. They didn’t ask for references or
inquire into his hobbies—or really attempt to learn anything about his
life thus far on earth. The Jane Street traders seemed to believe that
no evaluation of him other than their own was of any use in determining
whether he was suited to do what they did. But their questions were
mostly just mental math. The first ones were so trivial that Sam figured
they must just be trying to see how his mind responded when he was
nervous. “What’s twelve times seven?,” for example. And: “How sure are
you of your answer?” The more correct answers Sam supplied, the more
complicated the mental math became. If you roll two six-sided dice, what
are the odds you get at least one three? The odds of rolling a three
with one die were obviously 1 in 6. If you didn’t stop and think, you
might guess the odds of rolling a three with two dice were 1 in 3. The
error in that answer could be seen if you reframed the question: What
are the chances of NOT rolling a three with two dice? You had a 5-in-6
chance of not rolling a three with a single die; to get the odds with
two dice, you multiplied five-sixths by five-sixths. So: 25/36ths. There
was an 11-in-36 chance that, with a roll of two dice, you’d get one
three.</p>
<p>The in-person interview, in mid-November, was different. Jane Street
sent him a train ticket to New York City and provided a car and driver
to take him out to a disaster relief site in Totowa, New Jersey.
Hurricane Sandy had swept Jane Street out of its lower Manhattan
offices. The disaster site had an eerie industrial feel—the desks were
all the same, you needed a key to use the bathroom—but Sam hardly
noticed. What preoccupied him was what Jane Street wanted him to do for
an entire day: solve puzzles and play games. These games came with a
warning label, however. The Jane Street selection process was designed
to minimize the amount of valuable time the traders spent evaluating
applicants. The moment any interviewer disapproved of Sam’s play, the
games would end, and he’d be sent packing. The Jane Street trader who
handed him a stack of a hundred poker chips explained that this was his
stake for the day—and that no one who had lost all their chips playing
the games he was about to play had ever been given a job at Jane
Street.</p>
<p>For the first game, Sam was grouped in a room with two other
applicants and a Jane Street trader. The trader dealt out a hand of
poker, then asked them each to reveal a single card. Then he started
suggesting all these weird wrinkles on poker. For example: You can pay
four chips to exchange one of your cards for a new one. Does anyone want
to do that? After each new card, the trader would stop play and try to
provoke Sam and the other two guys into making side bets with each
other. Does anyone want to make odds on the next card being a heart? How
many clubs do you hold, collectively, in your hands? This wasn’t poker.
This was some kind of meta poker. Or a jousting tournament, but with
playing cards. Sam saw right away that the key to the game was to make
quick judgments about the expected value of bizarre situations, and act
on them. Yet none of the decisions actually felt all that strange to
him. “The thing that was surprising about them to me was the lack of
things that were surprising,” said Sam.</p>
<p>Of course, it was impossible to know just how accurately these games
identified great traders, because no one who played them poorly was
given a chance to trade. Still, at the end of that first round Sam was
sitting on a lot more chips than the other two applicants. At which
point his interviewers separated him from the other two applicants, whom
he never saw again, and put him through five more rounds of forty-five
minutes each. All of the games turned out to be as peculiar as the card
game. The coin-flipping game, for instance:</p>
<p>Here are ten coins, each differently weighted. One is a normal,
evenly weighted coin, and thus has a fifty percent chance of landing on
heads (or tails). The other nine coins are all unevenly weighted, though
no two in exactly the same way. We’re not going to tell you how they are
weighted, except to say that some are weighted to land more often on
heads and some on tails. One coin might land on heads sixty-two percent
of the time, for example, while another coin might land on tails eighty
percent of the time. You’ll be given thirty minutes to flip any coin you
wish. You’ll be allowed to flip one hundred times in total. For every
heads that you flip, you win one poker chip.</p>
<p>The Jane Street trader who was interviewing him finished explaining
the game and then asked: How much are you willing to pay to play? As you
could simply pick the evenly weighted coin and flip that a hundred
times, the expected value was at least fifty chips. Sam guessed he
should be willing to pay roughly sixty-five chips to play, though there
was no way to know, as they gave you no idea of the exact weighting of
the coins. That must have been, at worst, not an entirely wrong answer
to the trader’s question, as the trader allowed him to play. Once he
began flipping the weighted coins, the trader interrupted again, to
offer him even more weird gambles: Want to bet on what that next flip
will be? Want to bet on the true weighting of the coin you’ve now
flipped five times that came up heads four of them? Sam could see that
there was no exactly right way to play, just some wrong ones. Unless you
were simply giving up, there was no point in flipping the evenly
weighted, 50-50 coin, for example, as it gave you no new information. A
lot of very smart people wasted flips searching for the optimal
coin—that is, the one most heavily weighted toward heads. They’d flip
each coin five times, say, to gather the data they needed to make decent
statistical calculations. As a strategy it wasn’t totally dumb. But
their desire for greater certainty led them to waste a lot of flips on
inferior coins. Sam’s instinct was to pick an unevenly weighted coin and
flip it until it came up tails. Based on how many flips that took, and
some dirty math, he’d then decide whether to proceed with the coin or
move on to another. He started the game willing never to find the
optimal coin so long as he found a good enough one. The game, he sensed,
was testing his relationship to information: when he sought it, how he
sought it, how he updated his beliefs in response to it.</p>
<p>Jane Street poker wasn’t normal poker, and Jane Street coin flipping
wasn’t normal coin flipping. None of the Jane Street games were even
games, exactly, so much as games within games, or games about games. The
most difficult part of each game was seeing exactly what it was. “A
median American would take twenty minutes to just figure out what the
game was,” said Sam. “A Harvard student could understand the game, and a
Harvard math student could understand the game and the mathematical
structure underlying it. It’s a lot of quantitative information but not
perfect quantitative information. The idea is to give you partial
knowledge and relationships that can be only partially understood. And
there’s time pressure.” Sam thought time pressure favored him. It wasn’t
that he thrived under pressure; it was that he didn’t feel it. He wasn’t
better than usual when he was on a clock; he just wasn’t worse—and most
people were. Other people felt emotions; he did not. Most people, facing
a complicated problem and a ticking sound, had trouble seeing quickly
what mattered and what did not, especially if the problem had no perfect
solution. Few of the Jane Street traders’ questions had perfectly
correct answers. They were testing him for an ability to make messy
judgments and act quickly on them—and not to be too bothered about
questions to which he did not, and could not, know the answer. “It was
all the intuitive decisions you make in Magic, condensed down but even
more complicated,” said Sam. “Even Magic does not get you there.”</p>
<p>The puzzles that the Jane Street traders gave Sam to solve were
designed, like the betting games, to expose blind spots in his mind. The
one about baseball was the simplest example. What are the odds that I
have a relative who is a professional baseball player? one of the Jane
Street traders had asked him.</p>
<p>Sam’s first thought was to define the problem. If you didn’t define
the problem, you couldn’t solve it. “That was one thing he was testing
for with the question,” said Sam. “Did I realize that the question was
ambiguous?” What counted as a “relative”? he asked the trader. What did
he mean by “professional baseball players”? Every human being is related
to every other human being, in some sense. And lots of people who are
not in the major leagues are paid to play baseball. “Relative,” the Jane
Street trader said, was any second cousin or closer, and “pro baseball
player” included both major and minor leagues but nothing else. Sam
guessed there were roughly one hundred baseball teams that fit that
definition, and that each had roughly thirty players. So: three thousand
active pro baseball players, plus maybe another seven thousand retired
ones. Ten thousand players in a population of three hundred million
Americans. So: one in thirty thousand Americans had played or were
playing pro baseball. Sam didn’t know off the top of his head how many
relatives the average American had, but he thought thirty was a
reasonable guess. Thus the odds this guy had a relative who played pro
baseball were roughly one in a thousand.</p>
<p>The numbers were obviously not exactly right, merely a good enough
start. But it was here that Sam paused his mental math and said, I think
there’s a decent chance you are asking me this question because it is
salient for you—because you have a relative who plays professional
baseball.</p>
<p>Here things became tricky. The trader might have anticipated that Sam
would have this thought. The trader might have intentionally asked a
question that he had no special reason to ask, just to trick Sam. Here
was just another aspect of the puzzle: you had to figure out how many
levels down you should go before you should stop thinking. Sam decided,
as he nearly always did, that more than one level down was too clever by
half. It was far more likely that the guy had some reason to ask the
question than that he did not. He didn’t know by exactly how much, but
the mere fact the trader had asked the question shifted the odds that he
had a relative who played pro baseball to something better than one in a
thousand. “That was the other thing he was testing for,” said Sam. “Did
I realize that there was information in the question I was asked?”</p>
<p>In the end Sam put the odds at one in fifty. And it turned out that
the Jane Street trader did indeed have a second cousin who had played
professional baseball. But none of that was the point of the problem.
The point was how Sam framed it, or failed to. “There were no right
answers,” said Sam. “There were only wrong answers.”</p>
<p>By the end of the day of interviews, Sam felt he’d discovered
something about himself. “I thought, This is correctly testing for
something that matters quite a bit, even if I find it hard to articulate
what it is,” he said. Nothing in normal life—not even the games and
puzzles that had sustained Sam through childhood—could serve as a proxy
for whatever “traders” did at Jane Street. “Childhood doesn’t give you a
version of this that would tell you that you are good at it,” said Sam.
Childhood had given him math, at which he’d been very good but not
great. Childhood had given him various strategic board and card games,
at which he’d also been very good but not great. The Jane Street traders
had tested his mind for qualities it had never been precisely tested
for. And it appeared to Sam that God had tweaked trading in various
ways, or at least games intended to simulate trading, to make it
different from math and board games. Each of those tweaks had made the
games more congruent with his mind. “By the end of the day it was clear
that it was by far the best I’d ever done at anything,” he said.</p>
<p>Jane Street offered him a summer internship. So for that matter did
the other high-frequency trading firms that had invited him to apply.
One firm had halted their interview process midway through and announced
that Sam had done so much better at their weird games and puzzles than
every other applicant that there was no longer any point in watching him
play. Later, on the Jane Street trading floor, one fellow trader still
enjoyed dreaming up games and puzzles and putting them to Sam, just to
watch him play. Other people would have no idea what she was talking
about—would not even see what the game was. Sam would not only instantly
understand the game but would play it beautifully.</p>
<p>Perfume in the mail, she’d once said to Sam.</p>
<p>Sent scent, he’d replied.</p>
<p>Britney Spears is no longer working.</p>
<p>Idle idol.</p>
<p>A Goldman Sachs analyst discovers a cash flow model that predicts the
future.</p>
<p>Profit prophet.</p>
<p>In the presence of strange new games, the relevant thought processes
just seemed to come to Sam.</p>
<p>One other oddly big thing happened to Sam at the beginning of his
junior year. Completely out of the blue, a twenty-five-year-old lecturer
in philosophy at Oxford University named Will Crouchfn2 reached out and
asked to meet with him. Sam never learned how the guy had found
him—probably from the writing Sam had been doing on various utilitarian
message boards. MacAskill belonged to a small group inside Oxford that
had embraced ideas hatched long ago by an Australian philosopher named
Peter Singer. He wanted Sam to join him for coffee, then attend a talk
he was about to give down the road at Harvard. Just then Sam was maybe
the least likely person in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to voluntarily
attend a talk by some random academic. But the fact that this professor
had sought him out (signaling, to Sam, a justifiable lack of
self-importance), coupled with the mention of Peter Singer’s name,
caught his attention. Peter Singer was at least partly responsible for
the ideas Sam had about what to do with his life.</p>
<p>Those ideas, in their modern incarnation, dated back to 1971, when
Singer was himself a twenty-five-year-old lecturer in philosophy at
Oxford University. The trigger for them had been an oncoming famine in
Bangladesh. The sight of people dying of hunger who might have been
saved if only other, richer people had sent food bothered Singer enough
for him to think about it. In an essay, called “Famine, Affluence, and
Morality,” he groped for a way to dramatize the nature of this moral
failing. “I was trying to think of an example when it would be wrong not
to help even though you are in no way responsible for the problem,” he
said. The example he came up with was of a person out on a walk coming
upon a child drowning in a pond. What, asked Singer, would you do in
this situation? You wouldn’t even think about it. You would leap into
the pond and save the child, even if it meant ruining your expensive new
shoes. Then why, asked Singer, were we so slow to send the equivalent of
those expensive new shoes to prevent a Bengali child from starving? “The
whole way we look at moral issues—our moral conceptual scheme—needs to
be altered, and with it, the way of life that has come to be taken for
granted in our society,” he wrote, in that first of what would be a
lifetime of similar salvos. We needed to go way beyond ruining our new
shoes. Eventually he came to the view that we needed to give what we had
to others until the cost to ourselves outweighed the benefits to them.
We needed to stop thinking of charity as a thing that was nice to do but
okay not to do, and begin to think of it as our duty.</p>
<p>Singer himself proceeded to do just this, and gave away more and more
of his own earnings. His essay naturally launched a thousand rebuttals
from other philosophers. “Teachers would assign it to students and say,
‘Your task is to find where the argument is wrong,’” Singer recalled.
There were many obvious complaints: His story was about a single child:
it was not practical to save them all. Once you start down this road of
giving away everything but the bare minimum of what you need to survive,
where do you draw the line at what is enough? (“Sometimes There Is
Nothing Wrong with Letting a Child Drown” was the title of one
rebuttal.) Beneath much of the criticism was the feeling that Singer was
making it too difficult for ordinary affluent people to live a moral
life. “It has been argued by some writers … that we need to have a basic
moral code which is not too far beyond the capacities of the ordinary
man, for otherwise there will be a general breakdown of compliance with
the moral code,” wrote Singer, in one of his own rebuttals to this idea,
in his original paper. “Crudely stated, this argument suggests that if
we tell people that they ought to refrain from murder and give
everything they do not really need to famine relief, they will do
neither, whereas if we tell them that they ought to refrain from murder
and that it is good to give to famine relief but not wrong not to do so,
they will at least refrain from murder.”</p>
<p>The academic debate turned out not to matter very much in the real
world, as ordinary affluent people simply ignored Singer. For nearly
forty years, whenever Singer’s ideas came up, no one did much of
anything except squirm in discomfort. At Princeton, the school brimming
with ordinary affluent people where Singer wound up teaching, he was
permitted to introduce a course in practical ethics only after students
clamored for it. But then, in 2009, a small group of young philosophers
at Oxford University set out to put Singer’s ideas into practice. A
graduate student and research associate named Toby Ord kicked it off by
announcing that he would donate a third of his salary to charities
proven effective in poor countries, then explained his reasoning. (At
little inconvenience to himself his money would save, over the course of
Ord’s lifetime, eighty thousand African children from blindness.) Will
MacAskill followed with a charm offensive to recruit young people on
college campuses to join the cause. “The thing that Toby and Will did
was to say, ‘No, we think the argument is sound,’” said Singer. The new
social movement sprang directly from Singer’s forty-year-old argument.
Effective altruism, the Oxford philosophers called their movement, after
trying and failing to think of a better name.</p>
<p>The argument that MacAskill put to Sam and a small group of Harvard
students in the fall of 2012 went roughly as follows: you, student at an
elite university, will spend roughly eighty thousand hours of your life
working. If you are the sort of person who wants to “do good” in the
world, what is the most effective way to spend those hours? It sounded
like a question to which there were only qualitative answers, but
MacAskill framed it in quantitative terms. He suggested that the
students judge the effectiveness of their lives by counting the number
of lives they saved during those eighty thousand hours. The goal was to
maximize the number.</p>
<p>He then showed the students a slide listing the sorts of careers they
might pursue, were they to use their careers to save lives. He’d grouped
these into four broad categories and offered examples of each: Direct
Benefiter (doctor, NGO worker), Money-Maker (banker, management
consultant), Researcher (medical research, ethicist), and Influencer
(politician, teacher). Eventually, he told the students, you were going
to have to choose which sort of career you would pursue. Each career
type came with the opportunity to save lives, but the math was different
for each, a bit like the math for which hero to play in Storybook Brawl.
A Researcher or an Influencer stood a chance of saving some massive
number of lives. The agronomist Norman Borlaug (Researcher), for
instance, had invented disease-resistant wheat, which had saved roughly
two hundred fifty million people from starvation. Researcher and
Influencer, however, were tricky career choices: it was difficult to
predict who would be good at them, and even harder to forecast their
effects. The odds of any given Researcher or Influencer saving vast
numbers of lives were vanishingly small.</p>
<p>The clearer choice—the choice MacAskill dwelled on in his talk—was
between Direct Benefiter and Money-Maker. Put bluntly: Should you do
good, or make money and pay other people to do good? Was it better to
become a doctor or a banker? MacAskill made a rough calculation of the
number of lives saved by a doctor working in a poor country, where lives
were cheapest to save. Then he posed a question: “What if I became an
altruistic banker, pursuing a lucrative career in order to donate my
earnings?” Even a mediocre investment banker could expect sufficient
lifetime earnings to pay for several doctors in Africa—and thus would
save several times more lives than any one doctor.</p>
<p>Then he pushed his point a step further, in the direction of the
investment banker. “Making a difference requires doing something that
wouldn’t have happened anyway,” he said. If you didn’t become a doctor,
someone else would take your place and the doctoring would still get
done. Of course, if you didn’t become a banker, someone else would also
take your place—but that person would spend his money on houses and cars
and private schools for his kids and perhaps some non-life-saving
donations to Yale. Very little of the replacement banker’s earnings
would find its way to doctors in Africa. All those people you might have
saved if you had become a banker and given away your money would die.
Thus anyone with the ability to go to Wall Street and make vast sums of
money had something like a moral obligation to do so—even if they found
Wall Street faintly distasteful. “Many lucrative careers are really
pretty innocuous,” said MacAskill, helpfully.</p>
<p>Earn to give, MacAskill called his idea. His final slide was an
invitation: “If you are convinced to any extent by the arguments given
above, please come up and speak with me afterwards.” Even before he was
done, he knew the sort of person who’d be coming up to speak with him:
the sort of person who scored an 800 on their math SAT, and understood
that the test was too crude to capture their full aptitude. Like Jane
Street Capital, the effective altruism movement had come to Cambridge,
Massachusetts, for a reason. Roughly three in four of the people who
approached MacAskill after one of his talks were young men with a
background in math or science. “The demographics of who this appeals to
are the demographics of a physics PhD program,” he said. “The levels of
autism ten times the average. Lots of people on the spectrum.”</p>
<p>A few days later MacAskill wrote an email to another newly minted
effective altruist, whom he hoped to introduce to Sam.</p>
<p>I met Sam in Cambridge MA the other day—he’s a junior physicist at
MIT. Despite having the geekiest email address everfn3 I was super
impressed by him. He was brought up as a utilitarian by his parents, two
Stanford professors, is serious, dedicated, and committed to doing good,
and seems really smart and sensible too (i.e. takes some of the weirder
ideas seriously, but isn’t fanatic about them). He’s thinking about
earning to give or going into politics.</p>
<p>Sam was only a step behind the first people responding to this new
call to arms. That fall of 2012, a student of Peter Singer’s at
Princeton had just become the first college student, to Singer’s
knowledge, to take a job on Wall Street for the express purpose of
making money to give away. His name was Matt Wage, and he’d been hired
by Jane Street Capital.</p>
<p>In the presence of strange new games, the relevant thought processes
just seemed to come to Sam. In the presence of strange new people, not
so much—though it took Jane Street Capital a bit longer to figure that
out. That’s something they hadn’t tested for in the interviews. But at
the end of the summer of 2013, nine months after they’d hired him, Jane
Street executives sat Sam down to discuss his performance. The strengths
he’d revealed in the interviews were still clearly strengths. He’d been
better at all the trading games than most of the other interns. His mind
was clearly well suited to modern financial markets—so obviously so
that, just a few weeks into the summer internship, the Jane Street
executives had taken him aside and offered him a full-time job.</p>
<p>Sam’s weaknesses were the news. At the point of intake, no one at
Jane Street had tested Sam for his social abilities. None of his
interviewers had cared how he related to other people. The Jane Street
executives now told Sam that more than a few people inside the firm were
asking the question that people had often asked about him: Who is this
guy? They’d compiled what amounted to a rap sheet. Several things had
occurred that summer to cause the Jane Street executives to be a bit
less sure of their feelings about Sam. All had involved social
interactions. Some Jane Street full-timers had found Sam’s constant
fidgeting annoying, especially the way he compulsively shuffled playing
cards. One senior Jane Street executive had been seriously offended by
the bluntness with which Sam had revealed the stupidity of a question
the executive had posed to a class of interns. Maybe most alarmingly,
more than a few Jane Streeters were disturbed by Sam’s indifference to
other people’s feelings. As an example, the Jane Street executives cited
what Sam had done to a fellow intern, here called Asher Mellman.</p>
<p>Jane Street’s interns had been encouraged to gamble with each other
and with the full-time employees. All summer the interns had made bets
with each other, on anything they could think to bet on—which team would
win some game, how many jelly beans some intern could eat in forty-five
seconds, which interns would receive full-time job offers, and so on. To
keep things from getting out of hand, Jane Street set a loss limit of a
hundred dollars per day per intern. The gambling was a teaching tool. It
taught interns to turn gambles that most people would not make at all,
or make by the seat of their pants, into numbers that could be analyzed.
It compelled them to think quantitatively about qualitative things. To
think rigorously about everything—even a jelly-bean-eating contest.
After all, what Jane Street was looking for were traders who could think
faster and better than everyone else in global financial markets.</p>
<p>On the day in question, Sam hadn’t been looking for trouble. It was
Asher Mellman who approached him. Which surprised him, because Sam could
not stand Asher. Asher had come to Jane Street from Harvard, and Sam had
decided, fairly quickly, that he was “fake and stuck-up and
unimpressive.” (“He half had some maybe gig with Nate Silver and he made
sure everyone knew.”) Sam realized that his feelings were a reflection
more of his own tastes than of some universal loathsomeness of Asher’s.
“It’s not that he’s an unlikable guy in general,” said Sam. “Much of the
world likes him. But if you don’t like Asher, you really don’t like
Asher.” Sam especially didn’t like the way Asher tried to impress other
people, because what Asher found impressive about himself were precisely
the qualities Sam most disliked in others. Asher was pretentious about
the food he ate, and he put more thought than most Jane Street interns
into the clothes he wore. “He had opinions on what sweater was a nice
sweater, and what were not nice sweaters.” Sam knew that a lot of
people, himself included, were bad at distinguishing their pet peeves
from legitimate criticism. “It triggered me in specific ways that I know
I’m sensitive to,” said Sam. “Part of me is like, Jesus Christ, Sam, why
do you care why he cares what sweaters he’s wearing?” A bigger part of
him cared.</p>
<p>And Asher had approached him. In the conference room, one morning.
Before Jane Street’s intern class.</p>
<p>Let’s make a bet, Asher had said.</p>
<p>On what?</p>
<p>On how much any one intern will lose gambling today.</p>
<p>Sam’s first thought was about adverse selection. Adverse selection
was a favorite topic at Jane Street. In this context it meant that the
person most eager to make a bet with you is the person you should be
most worried about betting against. When people wanted to bet—or
trade—with you, there was usually a reason: they knew something you did
not. (That they had a second cousin who had played in the minor leagues,
for instance.) The first thing you did when someone offered you a bet
was to make sure you weren’t missing what they might know. Some piece of
information. Some non-obvious angle to the problem. Lots of bets looked
stupid after the fact because the person on the receiving end hadn’t
thought about why a bet had been proposed in the first place. Jane
Street hammered this bitter fact into you every day, and these gambling
games were the tool.</p>
<p>A full-time Jane Street trader might approach a group of interns and
say something like: I got some dice in my pocket. Anyone want to make a
market how many? The interns, primed to gamble, were also eager to
impress full-time Jane Street traders. And so some less savvy intern
might actually do it. He’d think it over and (because he’d read the Jane
Street guide on how to make markets) say something like, Two at five,
one up. (That is, he’d “buy” at two dice or “sell” at five dice.) Some
other intern who “sold” to the less savvy intern would be betting that
the full-time Jane Street trader had fewer than two dice in his
pocket—and the smarter intern would win one dollar for each die fewer
than two the trader actually had (“one up”). If the trader had zero dice
in his pocket, the intern who had made the market would owe the savvier
intern two bucks. Anyone who “bought” from the intern at five was
betting that the trader had more than five dice in his pocket—and would
win a dollar for every die over five. Thus if you “bought” at five, and
the trader had only two dice in his pocket, you would owe the intern
three dollars. On the other hand, if the trader had nine dice in his
pocket, the intern owed you four dollars.</p>
<p>The full-time trader was not testing for an ability to make
intelligent guesses about the greatest and least number of dice held by
a person who walked around with dice in his pocket. He was testing to
see if the intern had the sense to ask meta-level questions: Why is this
trader asking me how many dice he has in his pocket? What risk might he
be disguising? “Two at five, one up” seemed reasonable—if you didn’t ask
those questions. After all, the trader probably had some dice in his
pocket—otherwise why would he be asking? And if he had more than five
dice in his pocket, surely you’d see a bulge. Two at five, one up was
not reasonable, however. Two at five, one up was all you needed to hear
to know that the intern should never be offered a full-time job as a
Jane Street trader. This became obvious to all after the intern said two
at five, one up, and the other, smarter intern had “bought” at five. And
the trader pulled from his pocket sacks that contained a grand total of
723 extremely tiny dice.</p>
<p>I just want to be clear, Sam had said to Asher Mellman. This cannot
settle above one hundred or below zero, right? (That is, the most that
any intern might lose in a day is one hundred dollars, and the least is
zero.)</p>
<p>Right, said Asher.</p>
<p>You really want to bet against me? asked Sam.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’d be fun.</p>
<p>You a buyer or a seller?</p>
<p>Depends on the price, said Asher.</p>
<p>Sam now knew most of what he needed to know—that Asher had not
thought hard enough about this bet he’d dreamed up. “If I were a more
mature person, I would not have taken the bet,” said Sam. Instead, he
said, I’m a buyer, at fifty. (As a “buyer” Sam was betting on an intern
loss of more than fifty dollars that day. If the biggest loser that day
lost only forty dollars, Sam would owe Asher ten dollars. If the biggest
loser lost sixty dollars, Asher would owe Sam ten dollars.)</p>
<p>Sixty-five, countered Asher. Sam promptly accepted, then turned to
the other interns in the room and shouted: Who wants to flip a coin with
me for ninety-eight dollars? The day’s lecture hadn’t started, but the
conference room was filling up. A bunch of interns already were hanging
around, waiting. I’ll pay a dollar to anyone who will do it! shouted
Sam. (“By then the interns are all addicted to gambling, and to positive
expected value gambling more than anything in the world.”) To the Jane
Street way of thinking, Sam was offering free money. A Jane Street
intern had what amounted to a professional obligation to take any bet
with a positive expected value. The coin toss itself was a 50-50
proposition, and so the expected value to the person who accepted Sam’s
bet was a dollar: (0.5 × 8) – (0.5 × 8) + = . The expected value of
Sam’s position was even better, thanks to his side bet with Asher that
paid him a dollar for every dollar over sixty-five lost that day by any
intern. After the coin flip, either Sam or some other intern would have
lost ninety-eight dollars: win or lose the coin flip, Sam would collect
thirty-three dollars from Asher (the difference between ninety-eight and
sixty-five).</p>
<p>Only Asher had negative expected value. Asher lost whatever happened.
And Asher was now clearly deeply embarrassed.</p>
<p>Sam won the first coin flip. But that was just the start. To maximize
Asher’s pain, some intern needed to lose one hundred dollars.</p>
<p>I’ll pay a dollar to anyone who will flip me for ninety-nine dollars,
Sam shouted.</p>
<p>Now he had a machine for creating wagers in which both parties
enjoyed positive expected value. That machine was named Asher. Interns
were lined up to take the bet. “People get so obsessed with free dollars
when you frame it correctly,” said Sam. He was by then in full obsessive
gaming mode. “There was nothing that was going to stop me. If I’d have
spent the rest of the internship flipping that coin, I’d have been
satisfied.” And for a while it appeared that he might, as he won the
second coin flip too.</p>
<p>I’ll pay a dollar to anyone who will flip me for ninety-nine fifty,
shouted Sam.</p>
<p>The other interns clearly felt obligated to take the bets, but the
mood in the room was shifting in response to Asher’s feelings. Plus the
Jane Street trader who was meant to deliver the lecture had arrived and
was watching the whole thing. But Sam won the third coin flip too, so to
his way of thinking the gambling wasn’t yet over.</p>
<p>I’ll pay a dollar to anyone who’ll flip me for ninety-nine
seventy-five, he shouted.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the fourth flip that Sam lost—and by then everyone
except Sam was unsettled by Asher’s humiliation. And yet Sam was ever so
slightly taken aback, a few weeks later, when his superiors expressed
their dismay at what he’d done. “They said the second coin flip was
already one too many,” said Sam. He wasn’t surprised to learn that Asher
Mellman felt wounded. What surprised him was that his Jane Street bosses
thought that he somehow missed the effect he was having on other people.
He’d known exactly what he was doing. What he’d done to Asher was no
more than what Jane Street was doing to competitors in financial markets
every day. “It was not like I was unaware I was being a piece of shit to
Asher,” he said. “The relevant thing was: Should I decide to prioritize
making the people around me feel better, or proving my point?” Sam
thought his bosses had misread his social problems. They thought he
needed to learn how to read other people. Sam believed the opposite was
true. “I read people pretty well,” he said. “They just didn’t read
me.”</p>
