<h4 id="the-org-chart">7 The Org Chart</h4>
<p>It didn’t take a psychiatrist to see a pattern in Sam’s relationship
with Caroline, but there happened to be one sitting in the middle of it.
His name was George Lerner, and by late 2021 he might have been the
world’s leading authority on the inner life of effective altruists. The
curious role had just naturally opened up to him, in much the same way
psychiatry had in the first place. He’d been drawn to it by the instant
intimacy it allowed him with others. “Honestly, it’s kind of amazing to
listen to other people’s stories and get paid for it,” he said. In his
first days at Baylor College of Medicine, they’d asked students to raise
their hands when their hoped-for field was called. When they called for
surgeons, lots of the students raised their hands. When they called for
psychiatrists, George’s was the only hand in the air. He’d moved to San
Francisco for his residency, at the University of California, and
remained to teach and build a practice.</p>
<p>George was born in Russia but moved with his family at the age of
eleven to California. He’d emerged from the experience a strange
combination of the two places. His eyes, his hair, his unchanging
five-o’clock shadow: all were part of the same picture, which might have
been drawn by Dostoevsky. Everything about George was dark, except for
his smile. While the rest of him frowned, his mouth would express mirth
and even glee. It was as if California had gone to work on him to lift
him out of a bottomless despair and stopped before finishing the job.
His patients, as a result, could likely find in his demeanor whatever
emotion they happened to need at the time.</p>
<p>The first group were all lawyers; one lawyer had wandered in and
recommended him to another lawyer, and before George knew it he was
spending all day listening to lawyers’ problems. “The lawyers didn’t
have great boundaries,” said George. “They’d all send over colleagues.”
The lawyers wanted to talk mainly about their failed relationships,
which got old fast. But after the wave of lawyers came a second wave, of
tech executives, who were far more interested than the lawyers had been
in talking about their work. “The tech people didn’t talk much about
their relationships,” said George. “They wanted me to really coach them
to be better engineers.”</p>
<p>The crypto people started turning up around 2017, the year crypto
went boom. They came in two basic flavors. First to come were the
originalists, who had been drawn to Bitcoin when it was still an
old-time religion. “They were, like, libertarians who have always worked
on their own and who didn’t fit well in big companies because of their
views,” said George. “They had a lot of complaints about people at work
pushing onto them pro-government views. They’re a little paranoid. The
world to them is a kind of conspiracy.” George saw enough of these
people to realize that it was no accident that they wound up in crypto.
“There was a dog whistle coming out of Bitcoin that attracted these
people,” he said. “They worked in some regular company but on the side
they had this interest. They wanted to talk about how they are afraid of
government. A lot of times their spouse or their family didn’t want to
hear about it anymore.”</p>
<p>They came to George because their bitcoin didn’t have ears and they
needed someone to listen. George was suited for the role, up to a point.
He’d always found it shockingly easy to occupy another person’s
intellectual point of view. “In some ways it really hurt me in
residency, because I couldn’t spot psychosis,” he said. “I’m like, I can
totally see from your point of view how you think your employers are
listening to your phone.”</p>
<p>The rise in the price of bitcoin ushered into George’s waiting room a
different type of crypto person. “The second crypto type is the person
who is young, hip, and wants to make money,” said George. This other
crypto type was less interesting to George. They were just worried the
government was going to tax their profits.</p>
<p>Then the effective altruists started showing up—and when they did,
George took a new and keener interest in his patients. Gabe
Bankman-Fried, Sam’s younger brother, was the first, but hard on his
heels came Caroline Ellison and others from Alameda Research. By the
time Sam arrived, a year later, George was treating maybe twenty EAs. As
a group, they eased a worry George had about himself: the limits to his
powers of empathy. When ordinary people came to him with their ordinary
feelings, he often found himself faking an understanding. The EAs didn’t
need his empathy; the EAs thought that even they shouldn’t care about
their feelings. In their single-minded quest to maximize the utility of
their lives, they were seeking to minimize the effect of their feelings.
“The way they put it to me is that their emotions are getting in the way
of their ability to reduce their decisions to just numbers,” said
George. “They’d ask: Should I have an affair? Well, let’s run the
cost-benefit analysis. EAs love that approach.” This approach also
suited George. He wasn’t able to feel his patients’ feelings. But he
could feel their thoughts.</p>
<p>He would never be one of them—he was himself unsure if altruism
existed in human nature. But he adored them. It was fun, for starters,
how young they all were—just kids, really, starting out in life.
“Initially it felt like they were playing a game. They were all outliers
in terms of their intelligence and the way they approached the world.”
Soon enough, he saw that it wasn’t a game. They were all completely and
utterly sincere. They judged the morality of any action by its
consequences and were living their life to maximize those consequences.
George accepted their premise, as he had accepted the premises of the
crypto guys who thought the government was spying on them. “It wasn’t my
job to challenge them,” he said. “They were internally consistent, and
if they’re internally consistent, I’m okay with it. And, you know, maybe
it’s a way of actually benefiting the world, even if it is a little bit
of a weird way.”</p>
<p>As a group, they were as likely to want to talk about their
philosophy as they were their personal issues, and these philosophical
discussions were more entertaining to George than anyone’s issues. But
George heard about the issues, too, and this allowed him to detect
patterns in his new patients’ behavior. For example, they all professed
to care about “humanity,” while at the same time often being a bit slow
to love actual people. “It doesn’t really start with people,” said
George. “It starts with suffering. It’s about preventing suffering. They
care about animals in the same way. They also care about not having the
earth blown up by an asteroid. But it’s not a longing for a
connection.”</p>
<p>They also cared about the logic underpinning their behavior;
consistency was, for them, not the hobgoblin of a little mind but the
mark of a big one. They brought logic and rigor to their most
emotionally fraught decisions—for instance, the decision whether to have
children. “A lot of EAs chose not to have kids,” said George. “It’s
because of the impact on their own lives. They believe that having kids
takes over from their ability to have impact on the world.” After all,
in the time it took to raise a child to become an effective altruist,
you could persuade some unknowably large number of people who were not
your children to become effective altruists. “It feels selfish to have a
kid. The EA argument for having a kid is that kid equals happiness and
happiness equals increased productivity. If they can get there in their
head, then maybe they have a kid.”</p>
<p>The fact that none of this came naturally to human beings—that they
had had to think their way into their way of life—was also important.
“There are two parts of being EA,” said George. “Part one is the focus
on consequences. Part two is the personal sacrifice.” On part one the
EAs were in general agreement; when it came to part two there were
serious differences among them. It was easy to talk the talk, but how
far were you willing to walk the walk, in your commitment to saving
other people’s lives? Would you give up kids? Would you donate a kidney?
Sam Bankman-Fried, George felt, lived on one end of the spectrum. Sam
had an almost weirdly low tolerance for physical pain and so passed on
donating his kidney. Otherwise, Sam was all in on the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Caroline Ellison wasn’t like that. She lacked confidence in herself.
“She was borrowing her ego from Sam because she lacked one,” said
George. “Sam gave her real inner strength.” In George’s EA patient
population, Caroline defined the other end of the spectrum of
willingness to sacrifice for her principles. When she’d first come to
him, back in 2018, she’d had two issues she wanted to talk about: her
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and her new and emotionally
complicated polyamorous lifestyle. Every subsequent session after the
first, Caroline came with just one issue she wanted to discuss: Sam.
She’d fallen in love with Sam, Sam didn’t love her back, and that fact
alone left her deeply unhappy. “I thought of her as an exception,” said
George. “I thought she might be willing to trade EA for reciprocation of
love any day.”</p>
<p>George didn’t really see it as his job to explain Sam to Caroline or
to dissuade her from her quest for his love. “If I was her friend—and
not her therapist—I would have said you’re never going to get what you
want from this guy.” It was still painful to listen to the steady
drumbeat of her desire for Sam to publicly acknowledge their
relationship. After nearly two years in Hong Kong, she’d let a few of
their inner circle, their fellow EAs, know about it. “That’s the
highlight of the relationship for her,” said George. “It was a big ask
of him, and she seemed happy with that. It was an affirmation of the
relationship, and it showed some level of commitment. She never got
anything that big from him before.” After which Sam hopped on a plane to
the Bahamas and never returned. And then, just a few weeks later, called
George, and suggested that he move from San Francisco to the Bahamas and
serve as corporate psychiatrist to FTX.</p>
<p>After The Schism, and right before his flight to Hong Kong, Sam had
been in the market for a new therapist. Various former therapists had
failed to be useful, mainly because they could not bring themselves to
believe that he was who he was, and instead insisted that he must be
someone else. “The previous therapists were incredulous about various
parts of me,” he said. He’d explain, for example, what he thought of as
his perfectly rational decision made at a surprisingly young age to
never have children. Or he’d tell them of his absence of feeling, or how
he had never felt pleasure. (They had a term for it: anhedonia.) They’d
sort of nod for a bit but then mistrust his self-diagnosis. “It was
like, what about me are you disputing?” said Sam. “There was not any
clear way to break through with them. I know that there are things that
are unusual about me. They wouldn’t just accept them and move on.” Add
to the list of people who failed to understand him his therapists.</p>
<p>What he liked about George was that George simply took him as he
was—and actually didn’t seem all that interested in engaging in
pointless conversations about his feelings. Sam had long since decided
that any discussions about his inner life, and its consequences for
others, were futile. “The social stuff was basically unsolvable,” he
said. He didn’t need a therapist to deal with his problems—though he did
need someone who could prescribe his medications. The problems that
interested Sam were other people’s problems. He soon figured out that
George could be extremely useful with these. When, say, two employees
were squabbling, George could help Sam think through ways to resolve
their dispute. To most everyone else George was a shrink. For Sam, he
became something like a management consultant. (“Sam never wanted to
talk about himself,” said George. “All we ever talked about was
business.”)</p>
<p>Caroline’s insistence on going public with her and Sam’s feelings for
each other would not have made it onto any official, or likely
conscious, list of the reasons Sam felt he’d be better off staying in
the Bahamas than returning to Hong Kong. In his mind there was not one
reason for the move; there were several. The Hong Kong government’s
imposition of quarantines of fourteen to twenty-one days for anyone
entering the country made foreign travel all but impossible. The Chinese
government’s habit of arresting the heads of any crypto exchanges they
could get their hands on and arbitrarily freezing their funds put
everyone at FTX on edge. The lawyers, and a few of the Chinese
employees, bothered Sam constantly about the risk. FTX employees had
hatched an escape plan for Sam and Gary—of which Sam was oblivious—to be
carried out if the Chinese police ever came for them. “The 007 plan,”
they called it. There were two large men guarding the front door of the
office, a way out the back, and a fueled-up jet ready to take the two to
safety at any moment. Still, scary as the Chinese police might have
been, they were, to Sam, less worrisome than Caroline. “I feel bad
dumping this on you now,” he wrote to her, not long before he fled Hong
Kong. Then he launched into his own business memo:</p>
<p>I really really don’t like people knowing we’re dating. The reasons
are, basically: It makes it really hard for me to manage well because of
worries about bias</p>
<p>It’s potentially really bad PR</p>
<p>It makes me feel really uncomfortable</p>
<p>It makes people more uncomfortable at work around you</p>
<p>I was really unhappy with the conversation around it leaking at the
office: I understand you might like it if it leaks, but I don’t, and
it’s a borderline dealbreaker for me</p>
<p>I also think you are wrong to like it leaking; I think you’re
forgetting the second order effects here</p>
<p>This comes up in a lot of ways. Examples are: If I go up to you
specifically and say goodbye at a mass event we’re both at, that’s not
very subtle</p>
<p>Being indiscreet about finding ways to meet up (this is at least as
much my fault as yours)</p>
<p>Telling people</p>
<p>I’m pretty wary of ending up in traps where a relationship really
bends my life in shitty ways</p>
<p>Most of all—I really want to make you stronger, and I worry that in
part I might be doing the opposite. I worry that the drive to impress me
is too much on your mind. You don’t have to; you already do.</p>
<p>I worry that fear of judgement from me makes you find some things
really aversive.</p>
<p>He ended with a single line: “I’m really sorry that I’m such a shitty
person to date.”</p>
<p>At any rate, by late summer 2021 the hard part wasn’t leaving Hong
Kong. It was figuring out where to go. It had to be somewhere with
financial regulation that explicitly allowed a crypto futures exchange.
That ruled out Europe and the United States. Taiwan was no good, as the
Chinese might invade at any moment. Antigua had good laws but bad
internet. Uruguay just felt weird. Dubai might have worked, but it would
be hard on FTX’s large and growing population of Chinese female
employees, and Sam bridled at the idea of the government telling people
what they could and could not wear. Singapore, Gibraltar, Israel … this
list of places in which FTX would be legal yielded a bunch of names that
didn’t work for various reasons. Oddly, the Bahamas hadn’t even made
that initial list—but then Ryan Salame visited to look for a vacation
house to buy, and happened to learn that the Securities Commission of
The Bahamas was putting the finishing touches on new crypto
regulations.fn1 The Bahamas had great internet, piped in by undersea
cable from Florida. It had a neutral tax system that gave you credit for
taxes paid to other countries, empty office space, and a truly wild
number of empty luxury condominiums waiting to be turned into worker
housing. And it was sufficiently hungry for any kind of business that
when Sam landed to check out the place he found himself meeting with the
newly elected prime minister. “Sam, we’re broke,” he’d confessed.</p>
<p>Sam wasn’t broke. Just then Sam was the opposite of broke. Alameda
Research was no longer paying loan shark interest rates to borrow tens
of millions of dollars from effective altruists. The new crypto lenders
like Celsius and Genesis were willing to hand Alameda Research
collectively between 0 billion and 5 billion at rates as low as 6
percent. The rate of return inside Alameda was steadily declining, but
with access to vast amounts of cheap capital, its raw trading profits
kept rising: from 0 million in 2018, to 00 million in 2019, to billion
in 2020 and again in 2021. And those were just the trading profits; the
numbers didn’t include the seemingly vast unrealized gains on Sam’s
token stashes.</p>
<p>In March 2020, a Silicon Valley engineer named Anatoly Yakovenko
launched a new and better blockchain that offered a solution to maybe
Bitcoin’s biggest weakness as a means of exchange: it was way too slow.
Bitcoin could only validate seven transactions a second. The new Solana
blockchain promised to process up to sixty-five thousand transactions a
second. Sam had no independent ability to evaluate the thing, but he
asked people who did and soon decided that Solana might be the crypto of
the future. Even if it wasn’t, Solana’s story was good enough that other
people might see it that way and drive up the price of its token.
Eighteen months later, Alameda owned roughly 15 percent of all Solana
tokens, most purchased at twenty-five cents apiece. The market price of
Solana had gone as high as 49, a thousand-times increase on what Sam had
paid for the tokens, and the face value of Sam’s entire stash was
roughly 2 billion. It was hard to know the resale value of such a huge
stake. But there was a real market for Solana tokens. Two billion
dollars’ worth of the things traded each day. “I watched it in wonder,”
said Sam.</p>
<p>Solana was a microcosm of everything else Sam touched at that moment.
It had a story that Sam amplified, by embracing the story. “It was the
most complete proof we ever found of the hypothesis that we could have
an insanely large edge on things like this,” he said. “It was
self-fulfilling. The fact that we took a big position was part of what
caused it to go up.”</p>
<p>There was more like this in Sam’s dragon’s lair. Alameda had also
hoovered up about half the existing FTT tokens, for instance, creating,
in effect, a second stake in FTX for Sam, with a claim on about
one-sixth of all FTX’s revenues. In the past eighteen months, FTT’s
price had risen from roughly to roughly 0. Again, it was hard to say how
much Sam could unload FTT for, had he tried to sell his stake all at
once. But the crypto lenders were happy to lend him billions of dollars
against his FTT, so, to get his hands on cash, he didn’t need to sell
it.</p>
<p>Then there was Sam’s equity stake in FTX, which was very real indeed.
A large number of venture capitalists had paid .3 billion for a mere 6
percent of it. Sam had good reason to believe that he might now sell an
even smaller piece for several billion more to an even bigger group. FTX
underpinned his growing empire: a real business with booming revenues
and profits. It hadn’t even really needed venture capital. (As if to
make the point, Sam, having taken 00 million from Sequoia Capital in
exchange for a piece of FTX, turned around and invested 00 million from
Alameda Research in one of Sequoia’s funds.) FTX was now the world’s
fastest-growing crypto exchange, and the casino of choice for big
professional traders. In less than three years, it had gone from 0 to 10
percent of all crypto trading. In 2021, it would generate billion in
revenues.</p>
<p>And yet it still obviously had lots of room to grow. Its biggest
rival, Binance, had five times the trading volume of FTX, which meant
that it likely had roughly five times FTX’s revenues and five times
FTX’s market value. The experts who tried to determine the present value
of rich people had trouble putting a number on CZ’s. No one was sure how
much of Binance CZ actually owned. In 2021, Forbes had listed CZ’s
wealth as less than Sam’s, but neither Sam nor anyone else inside FTX
believed the numbers. Sam thought CZ might be the richest person in the
world. And CZ, to the people who supplied Sam with capital, seemed
vulnerable. When Forbes looked at Sam in the fall of 2021, they saw the
richest person in the world under the age of thirty. When the VCs looked
at Sam, they saw the guy who might very soon replace CZ as the richest
person in the world, period.</p>
<p>All of that explained what Sam was about to do at this moment—and
what would later feel a lot harder to explain or even to believe. He set
out to establish FTX as the world’s most regulated, most law-abiding,
most rule-following crypto exchange. To acquire as many licenses to
allow him to operate legally and openly in as many countries as he
could. To make a bet on the rule of law shaping the lawless crypto
markets. By the end of 2021, 16 percent of Americans claimed to have
dabbled in crypto. Across Asia the numbers were likely bigger. It was
only a matter of time, Sam thought, before regulators engaged with
crypto and banished the unlicensed exchanges.</p>
<p>The strategy was something like the opposite of Binance’s. When FTX
launched, in May 2019, Binance was merely one of a handful of crypto
exchanges with roughly the same market share, of roughly 10 percent. One
of those, BitMEX, soon ran afoul of the US Department of Justice, for
“willfully failing to establish, implement and maintain an anti-money
laundering program,” and its founders, two American and one British,
were variously fined, given probation, and placed under house arrest.
Two other exchanges, OKEx and Huobi, reportedly watched executives being
hauled off by the Chinese police, and saw their assets frozen. There
have been no reports OKex (now OKX) or Huobi faced any legal actions. CZ
had left China three years earlier, in late 2017, before that year’s
government crackdown, one of several before and after. He’d landed first
in Singapore but finally settled in Dubai, which, among its charms, had
no extradition treaty with the United States. Which was useful, as CZ’s
first response to new rules and regulations was often to ignore them,
and count on the regulators to lack the nerve or the resources to take
action.</p>
<p>That had been the smart thing to do, so far. In two years, Binance’s
share of crypto trading had boomed, from 10 percent to 50 percent. It
offered financial products that local regulators either had banned or
had yet to approve, and the regulators did not seem willing to do much
about it. Binance’s own exchange token, called BNB, was an example. BNB
was to Binance what FTT was to FTX: a claim on the revenues of the
enterprise. You could make a reasonable argument that bitcoin wasn’t a
security and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had made it, and
declared it a commodity. There was no similar argument to make for BNB
or FTT. They’d been created and sold to investors to raise money for
profit-making enterprises. They paid dividends to their owners, in the
form of lower fees on the exchange and the buyback-and-burn agreements.
There was no definition of a security that they didn’t meet. If you
tried to sell them to American investors inside the United States, it
was hard to imagine the Securities and Exchange Commission simply
turning a blind eye. And yet Binance sold BNB—and much else—to Americans
inside the United States. In the immortal words texted by Binance’s
chief compliance officer to a colleague in 2018: “we are operating as a
fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.” (This and other
similar morsels turned up in a lawsuit filed by the SEC against Binance
five years after the fact, in June 2023.)</p>
<p>In their willingness to court the wrath of US financial regulators,
the crypto exchanges fell into one of at least four categories. A small
group of tiny US exchanges listed only bitcoin and ether, the two oldest
coins, blessed by the SEC as commodities and openly regulated by the
CFTC. (A bit oddly, the older the coin, the more people thought of it as
a commodity.) FTX’s new US exchange listed those two coins, plus maybe
eighteen other, newer ones, none of which had the most obvious
properties of a security. None of them had buyback-and-burn features,
for example, or were solely intended to raise money for some for-profit
enterprise. Coinbase, the exchange that serviced the greatest number of
US customers, appeared willing to take more regulatory risk. It listed
roughly five hundred coins, including some that the SEC pretty clearly
viewed as securities, and its CEO, Brian Armstrong, took to Twitter to
criticize the regulators for “sketchy behavior.” Coinbase itself had no
exchange token akin to FTT, however, and so wasn’t in the most brazen
position of using its exchange to sell its own unregulated securities to
US investors. Only Binance did that, with BNB.</p>
<p>Selling what were in effect shares in itself to US retail investors
on its own new US crypto exchange, Binance lifted the biggest middle
finger to the US regulators. In the bargain, it juiced the value of BNB
incredibly. When Binance formally opened its US exchange, in September
2019, the market cap of BNB was a bit shy of billion. By the fall of
2021, it topped 00 billion. How much of the rise was driven by demand
from US investors was hard to guess, but Sam guessed anyway: 0 billion.
The ire of US regulators seemed, by comparison, a small price to
pay.</p>
<p>Which is why, when Sam took in the situation, he decided that
Binance’s strategy was unsustainable. That the smart thing to do was to
be the world’s most law-abiding and regulator-loving exchange. FTX could
use the law, and the regulators, to drive crypto trading from Binance
and onto FTX. If countries did not yet have the laws, a small army of
FTX lawyers would help them to create them. In the country that mattered
most—the one country whose financial regulators chased people outside of
their borders, and enforced its rules around the globe—Sam would
personally take the lead. He’d set out to persuade the United States
government to regulate crypto and punish those who violated the new
rules, leaving FTX alone as a kind of teacher’s pet of crypto. (Maybe
the best thing about the Bahamas, from Sam’s point of view, was how
close it was to the United States.)</p>
<p>The US was now, in Sam’s mind, the holy grail. It had an incumbent
crypto exchange, Coinbase. But Coinbase’s CEO had already written
insulting tweets about the SEC. And Coinbase, compared to FTX, was a
boring and bloated casino. It had fifteen times the number of employees
FTX did, and only about a fifth of FTX’s volume. Charging retail
investors fees between five and fifty times what FTX charged, it was
still running big losses. Even so, it was a public company, with a
market capitalization of more than 5 billion. If FTX was granted a
license to offer crypto futures in the United States and was given full
access to US investors, it might steal Coinbase’s customers, along with
its market cap. Or so Sam thought—which is why he also thought that the
license might double or even triple FTX’s value overnight.</p>
<p>Before he could do any of this, he needed to get rid of CZ. CZ still
owned the stake in FTX that he had bought in late 2019 for 0 million.
Relations between Binance and FTX had since deteriorated into simmering
resentment. Binance was the class bully, FTX the class nerd, and each
took pleasure in using its special powers to torment the other. The
Binance futures launch was a case in point. It had taken the Binance
internal team three months longer to create their crypto futures trading
platform than it had taken Gary, working by himself, to create FTX’s.
Once it was up and running, it attracted little interest. Or, rather, as
Sam instantly noticed, what trading there was in Binance’s new futures
contract was fishy: instead of the spasmodic flows of naturally
occurring market activity, there was a regular tick, tick, tick of
trades. He guessed that Binance had created bots to trade its new
contract with itself, to create the illusion of activity.</p>
<p>Wash trading, as it was called, would have been illegal on a
regulated US exchange, though the sight of it did not bother Sam all
that much. (Later, in 2023, when the SEC charged Binance over alleged
wash trading, a spokesman for Binance told the Wall Street Journal in
July 2023 that neither the company nor CZ had ever engaged in or
tolerated it.) He thought it was sort of funny just how brazenly many of
the Asian exchanges did it. In the summer of 2019, FTX created and
published a daily analysis of the activity on other exchanges. It
estimated that 80 percent or more of the volume on the second- and
third-tier exchanges, and 30 percent of the volume on the top few
exchanges, was fake. Soon after FTX published its first analysis of
crypto trading activity, one exchange called and said, We’re firing our
wash trading team. Give us a week and the volumes will be real. The top
exchanges expressed relief, and gratitude for the analysis, as, until
then, lots of people assumed that far more than 30 percent of their
volume was fake.</p>
<p>Sam was less surprised that Binance was wash trading than by how
badly they were doing it. “They were doing a B-minus job at market
manipulation,” he said. One Binance bot would make a wide market in
Bitcoin futures, and another Binance bot would enter and lift its high
offer. If, to keep the numbers simple, the fair value of bitcoin was 00,
the first Binance bot would insert a bid at 8 and an offer at 02. No
normal trader would trade against either—why sell for 8 or buy for 02 on
Binance what you could buy or sell on some other exchange for 00? But
then, at regular and predictable intervals, the second Binance bot would
enter the market and buy at 02. It looked as if a trade had occurred
between two different parties, but it hadn’t. It was simply Binance
buying from Binance.</p>
<p>Sam loved this sort of thing: it was Jane Street trading all over
again. In response, he had his traders at Alameda Research build their
own, faster bots. Alameda’s bots inserted offers a tiny bit cheaper than
the offers from Binance bots. The Binance bot would offer to sell a
Bitcoin future at 02, and, moments before the second Binance bot showed
up to buy, the Alameda bot would leap in and offer it at 01.95. Instead
of buying bitcoin from itself at an inflated price, Binance was buying
it from Alameda Research at a price nearly as high.</p>
<p>Selling to Binance bots for 01.95 what they could buy elsewhere at 00
was found money for Alameda. But then the futures team inside Binance
began to notice that their wash trading was losing money—and complained
to CZ. That they hadn’t told CZ the full story, or that they had not
fully grasped what had happened, was evident in CZ’s confusing
response:</p>
<p>“It was very Chinese not just calling me up and saying, ‘Hey, can you
stop?’” said Sam. After that he’d called Binance’s chief financial
officer, Wei Zhou. It was a weird conversation—the CEO of one crypto
exchange calling the CFO of another to inform him that, if he didn’t
want to lose money on his new futures contract, he’d need to improve his
market manipulation. Wei Zhou spoke to CZ, who called Sam for a brief
though not unfriendly chat, after which Sam concluded that CZ still had
not been told by his traders what had actually happened. Whatever he’d
been told led him to tweet a retraction that didn’t make much more sense
than what he’d originally written:</p>
<p>In the first eighteen months of FTX’s existence, there had been
several other dustups with Binance of this sort. CZ developed what three
of his employees at the time described as an obsession with his new
rival. He’d ask staff for regular reports about FTX, and speak of FTX in
ways he would not of the other exchanges. “CZ is super astute,” said
one. “He’ll never talk about any exchange. He thinks it’s free
marketing. But FTX worried him. From 2019 on, he only spoke of FTX. He
thought FTX was the only real threat to his position.” A threat in which
he was, weirdly, the second-largest shareholder, after Sam.</p>
<p>By the middle of 2021, Sam saw that he could not sweet-talk
regulators and at the same time have CZ as a big investor. If you wanted
to be the teacher’s pet, you couldn’t sit in the back of the classroom
with the badass in the leather jacket. The first thing every regulator
asked for was a list of your investors, and personal details about them.
“They were asking CZ what his family situation was and where he lives,
and CZ didn’t want to say,” said one former Binance employee. In the
end, Sam told CZ that he wanted to buy him out of his FTX shares. For
the stake he’d paid 0 million to acquire, CZ demanded .2 billion. Sam
agreed to pay it. Just before they signed the deal, CZ insisted, for no
particular reason, on an extra 5 million. Sam paid that, too. Whatever
gratitude CZ felt about his two-billion-dollar windfall he hid. “From
then it was a cold war,” said Sam.</p>
<p>The buyout of CZ occurred against a backdrop of the bigger public
relations assault. Sam was now a regular on television and had appeared
on the cover of Forbes magazine. He still had no idea how to create a
brand, and, as ever, zero interest in expert opinion about how to do it.
He decided to figure it out from scratch, by talking it over internally,
hurling some money around, and seeing what worked. With one hand he was
handing CZ .275 billion; with the other he was writing memos to people
inside FTX in which he ruminated, as might a Martian, on what caused
ordinary Americans to like and trust a product. “We’re currently ahead
in tech and favorability ratings, and behind in name recognition,” he
wrote. “We need to get 50m low engagement users to decide to switch from
Coinbase to FTX. This will take a fairly forceful nudge!”</p>
<p>He began by noting how few marketing campaigns had had the effect
that he hoped to achieve with FTX’s. He counted only three:</p>
<p>Yes we can: Barack Obama</p>
<p>Just do it: Nike. Lots of athletes but there are two who made the
brand what it is: Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods</p>
<p>Think different: Apple. Albert Einstein, John Lennon, MLK, Muhammad
Ali, Rosa Parks, Gandhi, Alfred Hitchcock etc.</p>
<p>The crypto crowd was overwhelmingly young and male, and so it seemed
obvious to use sports celebrities to win their love and trust. But even
within the narrow world of sports, what people paid attention to struck
Sam as arbitrary. For example, in the United States, everyone knew and
cared about the names of the companies on their stadiums, but no one
knew or cared about the names of the companies on their players’
jerseys. There was no rule of human behavior that made this so: in
Europe everyone knew and cared about the names on the players’ jerseys
but not about the corporation the stadium was named for. There was no
moment at which Americans had agreed on the importance of the stadium
sponsors: it had just somehow happened. “And once everyone agrees on
what matters, it gets repeated,” said Sam.</p>
<p>The initial general wariness of crypto money made it a bit trickier
than it otherwise would have been to buy the naming rights for a
professional sports arena. FTX tried and failed to sponsor the stadiums
used by the Kansas City Chiefs and the New Orleans Saints. And so when
someone from the Miami Heat reached out to them to suggest that FTX buy
their naming rights, for 55 million for the next nineteen years, Sam
leapt at the chance. That the deal required the approval not just of the
NBA but also of the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners, a
government body, was a bonus. After that, they could point to a
government entity that had blessed FTX.</p>
<p>Once their name was on an American stadium, no one turned down their
money.fn2 They showered money across US pro sports: Shohei Ohtani and
Shaquille O’Neal and LeBron James became spokespeople. They paid Major
League Baseball 62.5 million to put the company name on every umpire’s
uniform. Having the FTX logo on the umpires’ uniforms, Sam thought, was
more useful than having it on the players’ uniforms. In basically every
TV shot of every Major League Baseball game, the viewer saw the FTX
patch. “The NBA put us through a vetting process,” said FTX lawyer Dan
Friedberg. “Major League Baseball just said okay!”</p>
<p>Still, the idea that a person might find a product more desirable
simply because some famous person lied and claimed that they used it
struck Sam as dubious. “If you’re buying something, do you really care
what Baker Mayfield or Dak Prescott think?” he wrote to the random
collection of FTX employees deputized to help him stew on the subject,
as if no one had ever thought about it before. “If I told you that Baker
Mayfield really liked some home insurance company, you’d probably update
not at all.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t that celebrities didn’t make a difference but how
unpredictable were their effects: there was some mysterious interaction
of person and product that, very occasionally, penetrated the public
imagination. “Kevin Durant is a really good basketball player!” wrote
Sam. “But you probably don’t care which car he drives. But what if
LeBron James drives a Tesla? I mean, sure you’re probably not about to
go out and get one, but I have to say that it would probably make me
slightly more likely to eventually.”</p>
<p>With some products, he decided, no celebrity could help. (“Could any
endorsement deal make you much more excited to buy a Nissan? I’m not
sure any could for me.”) With others, it was a matter of who exactly was
doing the endorsing. He came to see the problem as one of finding “one
of the few people or things in the world that really move our
imagination.” And of all the things they did to promote the brand, only
three things really mattered, he thought, and one mattered more than all
the other things combined: Tom Brady.</p>
<p>You would think—Sam had initially thought—that if you were going to
pay some NFL quarterback to stand up and say he used FTX, it would make
little difference whether it was Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers or Dak
Prescott. You might see that Brady would be a bit better but think
Rodgers’s endorsement must be worth, say, half of Brady’s. But
everywhere Sam went, people mentioned that they had heard of FTX because
of Brady. Hardly anyone mentioned any of the other endorsers. “It was
very clear which things had an effect and which did not,” said Sam. “For
the life of me, I can’t figure out why this is. I still don’t know how
to verbalize it.” The Martian had discovered another weird but true fact
of modern human life: at any given moment there were only a few people
inside the collective imagination. “No one cares if Coinbase gets
Russell Wilson as a spokesperson after we get Brady,” Sam wrote in a
memo to his team.fn3</p>
<p>From the outside, FTX appeared to be creating a brand around an oddly
charismatic and possibly self-absorbed leader. The truth was even
stranger. FTX was spending a fortune learning how to market a product on
the fly, without much input from anyone who had done it before. In one
way, the approach clearly worked: in the mind of the American consumer,
FTX became better and better known, and Sam Bankman-Fried became more
and more famous. In another, it made little sense: FTX didn’t really yet
have much use for the American consumer. They’d opened a small exchange
in the US on which American investors could do very little. The
exchange’s most important products, crypto futures, were illegal to sell
to Americans. They were spending a lot of money on a business that might
or might not happen.</p>
<p>Except for the psychiatrist, and a lawyer or two, there was still no
one inside FTX who had much experience doing whatever it was they were
doing, other than the experience they were gaining by doing it for FTX.
No one saw any reason to make an exception for the architects. On a bike
trip across the United States to raise money for a good cause, Ryan
Salame had met an architect in her late twenties named Alfia White. One
thing led to another, and before Alfia knew it, Ryan was asking her to
design a vacation home for him in Bali. After Sam surprised Ryan by
calling for the whole company to follow him to the Bahamas, Ryan
scrambled for a place to put it. Not finding anything suitable as a
permanent home, he hired Alfia to design FTX’s new corporate
headquarters. Alfia had never done anything like it.</p>
<p>She brought in a friend from architecture school named Ian Rosenfield
to help. The curious thing about Ian, apart from the fact that he’d
never designed office buildings either, was that he’d been a high school
classmate of Sam’s. He was shocked to discover that not only was Sam
Bankman-Fried now one of the world’s richest people, but he was also
somehow working together with, and even managing, other human beings.
Ian still had an image in his head of the brainiac no one knew chugging
along by himself with the wheels of his rolly backpack clattering across
the Crystal Springs Uplands School cobblestones.</p>
<p>Alfia and Ian traveled to the Bahamas, set themselves up inside an
FTX conference room, and tried to figure out what to do. Sam had handed
Ryan his checkbook and told him to buy office space and as much worker
housing as fast as possible without worrying about the cost. No man was
ever so good at not worrying about the cost as Ryan. In a matter of
weeks, he had snapped up between 50 and 00 million in real estate,
including 53 million worth of condos in an expensive new resort called
Albany. To serve as temporary headquarters, he’d acquired a depressing
office park of a dozen small buildings. They’d been planted on six acres
of asphalt surrounded by a dense foliage that a scientist or a real
estate developer would call a subtropical forest but which anyone stuck
inside of it would call a jungle.fn4</p>
<p>Along the way, Ryan had paid .5 million to acquire, as a site for a
new corporate headquarters, 4.95 acres of the jungle itself, on a narrow
West Bay beach. He handed the land and a budget of several hundred
million dollars to the young architects and basically said, “Have at
it.” A project that size normally called for a project manager and an
owner’s representative and assorted other wizened adults, but Ryan left
the two young architects to handle it all on their own. “We were
supposed to design a mini city,” said Ian.</p>
<p>Before they could design a space to accommodate FTX, they needed to
understand its structure and its rituals and its habits. To be FTX’s
architects, they’d also need to be FTX’s anthropologists. Ian hadn’t
really known Sam in high school; now he and Alfia tried to figure out
this enterprise he’d built. Sam himself, they soon realized, would be of
no practical use. “Sam has no time,” said Ian. “Sam delegates all this
stuff to other people. From the start we tried to engage him, but he
didn’t engage. He said, ‘You’re the architects, I don’t have any
idea.’”</p>
<p>The mini city creators obviously had some questions needing answers.
For example: “How many people will occupy this city?” Or: “What does Sam
want his mini city to look like?” But Sam wasn’t interested in their
questions, and by the time they arrived neither was Ryan. Ryan had moved
back to the United States to help his new girlfriend run for Congress.
The architects found themselves handed off to Nishad Singh’s girlfriend,
Claire Watanabe—who had assumed Ryan’s role as spender of money and
manager of support staff in the Bahamas. “We said just give us a list of
the employees, give us anything,” said Ian. “Claire said, ‘I know it’s
weird, but we don’t have any of that—even the number of employees.’”</p>
<p>Lacking direction from above, the architects set out to observe FTX’s
employees in the makeshift jungle huts they now occupied. Every now and
then, they’d pull one of these incurious creatures aside to ask them how
they had used their old Hong Kong offices. “They kept saying, you don’t
need to interview us, just design it how you want to design it,” said
Alfia. That was obviously a dumb idea; even people who said they didn’t
care about the spaces they inhabited ended up caring, sometimes without
realizing that they did. “They don’t care what it looks like until they
see it,” said Alfia. There’d been a knock-down, drag-out argument in the
old Hong Kong office about the placement of a single door, for instance.
“A woman said it needed to be removed for feng shui, and a guy said no,
he wanted it, and the argument escalated,” said Ian. Eliminating the
doorway in a Hong Kong office building to satisfy one employee, and
adding another to satisfy another, had cost a million dollars. “It was
the million-dollar door,” said Ian.</p>
<p>The architects watched and listened and learned. They could see that
these FTX people, like their leader, essentially lived in the office.
Sam famously slept on the beanbag chair beside his desk in Hong Kong,
but Nishad, too, had made a bed under his desk. Ordinary employees who
thought that to be as successful as Sam was they must live as Sam did
were starving themselves of sleep and occupying the workspace in
unhealthy ways. One employee had gone thirty days without once leaving
the Hong Kong office. The office needed showers and sleep spaces; food,
clothing, and other material needs must be satisfied as efficiently as
possible, to minimize the downtime. “They get anything they want,” said
Ian, “but it gets delivered to their desk. The Amazon box storage room
hardly gets used.” That half the employees of the company were East
Asian had to be taken into account (everything would be subject to feng
shui), but the off-the-charts nerd factor mattered even more. “What they
want is power outlets—all over the place,” said Alfia. If the building
had windows, it must also have good blinds, to prevent the glare from
obscuring their computer screens. “They love their shades down,” said
Ian. They were either all alone at their desks or all together in a big
space, engaged in nerd recreations, and seldom anything in between. They
needed a big space for LARPing (live-action role-play) but told the
architects that they could really do that anywhere.</p>
<p>And they pretty much all shared, or said they shared, their boss’s
utter indifference to grace or beauty. “I’ve observed other tech
employees, and these people are different,” said Ian. “They care even
less about aesthetics and amenities.” The only sight that the FTX
employees all wanted was of their boss. Status in the company was
measured by proximity to Sam. Even from their jungle huts people
jockeyed for a view of him. The architects schemed the main building
with glass walls and mezzanines that offered unlikely interior views of
Sam. “It gives you an opportunity to catch glimpses of Sam no matter
where you are sitting,” said Ian.</p>
<p>In their quest to understand this strange new company, the architects
nagged enough people that finally someone sent them a note with what
they’d asked for in the first place: a list of what Sam Bankman-Fried
wanted in his corporate mini city. “There were only three things on it,”
said Ian. Sam wanted the building shaped like an F, for the benefit of
the people in the planes descending into Lynden Pindling International
Airport. He wanted the side of the building to evoke his unruly hair.
Unlikely as that sounded, Ian thought that it was just possible—they
could use CNC cut aluminum to abstractly mimic what he was now calling
“Sam’s Jewfro.” “It wasn’t actually a bad idea,” said Ian.</p>
<p>The third and final item on the list of Sam’s desires was the
tungsten cube. The tungsten cube was a bit of a head-scratcher. The
imaginations of crypto people everywhere, it turned out, had been
gripped by tungsten cubes. Tungsten, the architects now learned, was the
planet’s trendiest dense metal. Crypto people were then memeing about
“the intensity of the density.” A company in the Midwest had supposedly
created the world’s biggest tungsten cube. A mere fourteen inches, it
had cost a quarter of a million dollars and weighed two thousand pounds.
Sam had apparently ordered up such a cube, flown it into the Bahamas,
and wanted it displayed on a plinth in his mini city. The architects
never were shown Sam’s dense and precious cube, but they nevertheless
incorporated it into their drawings. “We designed a space for it,” said
Ian. That space was the big atrium in the city’s main building. The
tungsten cube would be the first thing a visitor to the global crypto
empire would see. Rising from the sea of abstraction, the earth’s most
concrete object.</p>
<p>Other than Sam’s list, the architects had no guidance. This puzzled
the architects, as the decisions they were making would be set in stone.
These were, after all, buildings. Once erected, they would be
unresponsive to any new thoughts Sam might have about their expected
value. Twice inside of three years, he’d moved his entire company nine
thousand miles. Their mini city was meant to serve as the headquarters
for a global financial empire, but the most likely way for FTX to become
a global financial empire was for the US regulators to give it
permission to set up shop in the United States. In which case Sam almost
certainly would move the company to the United States—and this mini city
would be, at most, some satellite office. “It has to feel comfortable if
it’s for six hundred people or for ten people,” said Ian delicately.</p>
<p>Instead of guidance, what the architects were given was a deadline.
They were to prepare the five acres of jungle, together with a slideshow
of photos of the imagined buildings, for a big public announcement.
Incredibly, they were ready for it when it happened, on April 25, 2022.
They’d cleared the jungle without a permit and sketched out their
designs without help. Beside the freshly shaven five-acre bald patch of
jungle, they’d erected a billboard, with a picture of the mini city and
a slogan, FTX: GROWTH IN PROGRESS. The Bahamas media assembled. The new
prime minister arrived, with an entourage. A big group of FTXers
appeared, carrying shovels, likely for the first time in their lives,
with which to break ceremonial ground. And from a car that also carried
FTX’s COO, Constance Wang, Sam emerged, looking as if he had fallen out
of a dumpster: cargo shorts, wrinkled T-shirt, droopy white socks. Same
guy, thought Ian.</p>
<p>From the moment he had started on the project and begun to observe
Sam from afar, Ian had found the same thought often crossing his mind:
how shockingly just like he’d been in high school Sam still was. When
the oddball in your high school class became one of the richest people
in the world, you sort of assumed the oddball must have changed. Sam
hadn’t changed. The world around him had.</p>
<p>Before the groundbreaking ceremony, Sam was meant to give a speech.
Ian thought he might need some help, and so before the proceedings, he
pulled him aside.</p>
<p>What have you seen of the design? asked Ian.</p>
<p>I’ve seen nothing, said Sam.</p>
<p>Have you at least seen the plans?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Huh, thought Ian. How would Sam give a speech about his new mini city
if he knew nothing about his new mini city?</p>
<p>What are you going to say?</p>
<p>I’ll just wing it, said Sam.</p>
<p>Which he did. By changing the subject. He did this a lot. Tossed a
question he didn’t want or know how to answer, Sam simply turned it into
one that he was happy to answer. The question he wanted to answer that
day was not “What is this mini city, and why does it look as it does?”
It was “Why did you come to the Bahamas?”</p>
<p>At some point the architects realized that Sam had no clue what
they’d designed, or that they’d designed anything at all. That they’d
made all the decisions about FTX’s new headquarters, projected to cost
hundreds of millions of dollars, without the slightest input from the
person who was paying for it. Soon they’d learn that even the list of
Sam’s desires they’d been given had not come from Sam—and that Sam
himself wasn’t aware that he had stated any desires. The list had been
created by someone else inside FTX who’d tried to imagine what perhaps
he himself might want in his new office buildings, were he Sam. Sam
didn’t want his Jewfro on the side of the building. This other person
had just imagined that “Jewfro on the side of the building” was the kind
of thing Sam might find amusing. The tungsten cube had been a cool idea,
but, really, what were the odds that Sam or anyone else bought and
shipped into the Bahamas a one-ton cube? If the cube existed, why hadn’t
the architects ever seen it? “I don’t even know if it was ever actually
bought,” said Ian, of this thing he had designed a building around. Only
in the context of FTX was this not bizarre. “Everyone was always making
decisions for Sam,” said Ian.</p>
<p>At the end of the ceremony, Sam lingered a bit. Ian seized the moment
to finally ask him directly the question he’d been trying for months to
ask.</p>
<p>What’s one thing you want out of these buildings, other than
work?</p>
<p>For the first time, Sam thought about it. Badminton courts, he
said.</p>
<p>That was it. That was all he wanted. Badminton courts.</p>
<p>How many courts? asked Ian.</p>
<p>Three, said Sam. Then he left.</p>
<p>“That was the first and only question we got to ask him,” said
Ian.</p>
<p>It was, of course, George Lerner’s job to listen to people’s
problems. Really, he tried. By the spring of 2022, he’d set up his small
office inside one of the jungle huts. A simple desk, a red sofa across
from it, and, in the corner, a baby blue beanbag chair, which everyone
understood was Sam’s spot. George’s door was open to anyone who wanted
to talk, but it wasn’t long before he was weary of how many people
wanted to talk to him, and why. “There were a bunch of people unhappy in
the Bahamas,” he said. The Asian guys wanted more Asian women to date.
The Asian women didn’t like the Asian guys available. “Everyone is
complaining about the lack of dating opportunities,” said George.
“Except the EAs. The EAs didn’t care.”</p>
<p>The non-EAs thought the EAs thought they were smarter than everybody
else. A lot of people were unhappy with Sam’s radically hands-off
approach to management. The Asians especially were confused by the lack
of an organization chart. A surprising number of people who were meant
to report directly to Sam had discovered how little Sam wanted to be
reported to by them. “There are a lot of people Sam would avoid,” said
George. “People thought they could use me to get to him. Other people
talked to me because they couldn’t talk to Sam. This was super
annoying.”</p>
<p>The Bahamas hadn’t granted George a medical license. His title was
Senior Professional Coach. This was actually the role he’d always played
for Sam—who would inevitably prefer to talk through his business
problems rather than his psychological ones, which he viewed as
intractable and thus pointless to discuss. Now, in the Bahamas, George
took to his new role as management consultant. From employee therapy
sessions he absorbed information about the company whose CEO he was now
advising. Complaints from the employees suggested that Sam either wasn’t
managing the people he was meant to manage or was doing it so badly that
he might as well not be doing it. “I felt there were way too many people
reporting to Sam,” said George.</p>
<p>A few months into his new job, George had seen one hundred of FTX’s
three hundred something employees. He enjoyed maybe the single best view
of its corporate architecture, with a clarity not available to its
investors, its customers, its employees, and, possibly, the person who
had created it. “Sam didn’t like people to have job descriptions,” said
George. “Everyone knew that he hated org charts.” Everyone also knew
that, as much as they might long for an important-sounding title for
themselves, Sam hated those too. He had written a memo to explain why.
“Thoughts On Titles,” he called it. “In the past few years, we’ve found
that titles can make people substantially worse at FTX,” it began. Sam
then listed some reasons why this might be so:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Having a title makes people feel less willing to take advice from
those without titles.</p></li>
<li><p>Having a title makes people less likely to put in the effort to
learn how to do well at the base-level jobs of people they’re managing.
They end up trying to manage people whose jobs they couldn’t do, and
that always goes poorly.</p></li>
<li><p>Having titles can create significant conflicts between your ego
and the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Having titles can piss off colleagues.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Be that as it may, George felt he needed to know where his patients
stood in the organization. “I didn’t understand the different
relationships, and I needed to, because a lot of people were coming to
me with conflicts,” he said. “I needed to see if what I was hearing made
sense.” Sam had turned his organization into a puzzle; his psychiatrist
set out to solve it.</p>
<p>In the end, George drew up the only internal org chart ever made of
Sam’s sprawling creation. (See inside of dust jacket.) By the time he
was done, he’d discovered many interesting things. Twenty-four different
people thought that they were reporting directly to Sam, for example.
The group included Sam’s father, Joe, and Sam’s childhood friend Matt
Nass, whose game, Storybook Brawl, Sam had for some reason just bought.
This group did not include the chief financial officer, because FTX did
not have a chief financial officer. There was no chief risk officer or
head of human resources, because they had none of that, either. “It
seems like a clubhouse more than a corporation,” said George.</p>
<p>It did have a chief technology officer, Gary Wang, but Gary was
socially isolated, with no one reporting to him. “Gary was off in his
own little box,” said George. In an ordinary tech company, a bunch of
programmers would be reporting to the chief technology officer. In FTX
they apparently all reported to Nishad Singh. Ryan Salame, who had come
and gone from the Bahamas in a flash and now seemed hardly involved with
the company, was somehow the CEO of the entire international business,
with twenty-seven people reporting to him. Ramnik Arora, whose official
title was still Head of Product, clearly had nothing to do with product
but sat on top of a small pile of people in charge of both raising and
investing vast sums of money. George just put him in a little box marked
“Ventures.” About half the entire company reported to the first two
young women Sam had hired upon his arrival in Hong Kong, Constance Wang
and Jen Chan. Most of those people, George noted, were East Asian
women.</p>
<p>Then there was Caroline Ellison. Caroline was apparently alone in
charge of the twenty-two traders and developers working inside Alameda
Research, about half of whom had followed Sam from Hong Kong to the
Bahamas. This surprised George a bit. “She never said anything about
Alameda,” said George. “Neither did Sam. This was clearly wanting not to
think about it.”</p>
<p>In a memo dated February 6, 2022, and titled “Thoughts,” Caroline had
listed half a dozen ideas to improve her relationship with Sam. “Couples
counselling with Lerner” was number three, in between “choose a point in
the future at which to decide whether to break up” and “resolve to
communicate better in the future.” By the time she’d followed Sam to the
Bahamas, their affair was going even more poorly than usual. On the
night of April 15—ten days before they broke ground on the new corporate
headquarters—they sat down to discuss their future. The next day,
Caroline summarized their discussion in a memo to Sam:</p>
<p>Caroline plan I quit Alameda and move back to the United States</p>
<p>SBF plan break up, stay friends, try to cause as little drama as
possible</p>
<p>That night, they’d argued about the wisdom of her continuing to run
Sam’s private hedge fund-cum-dragon’s lair, as opposed to doing
something else with her life. “Running Alameda doesn’t feel like
something I’m that comparatively advantaged at or well suited to do,”
she now wrote. “… I feel like I need to do a ton of things I’m not very
good at … But yeah, I think it’s plausible that running Alameda is super
high EV and way higher than my next best option. I think I shouldn’t
consider quitting Alameda until I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about
alternative options and their EV.”</p>
<p>What Caroline would consider doing, and right away, was ceasing to
sleep with Sam. She didn’t want to move out of their bedroom in the 0
million penthouse condo purchased by Ryan that they now shared with
eight other effective altruists, including Nishad and Gary. It was Sam
who needed to move, furtively, into a lesser condo in the same compound.
Inside the company, hardly anyone other than the few EAs Caroline had
shared the secret of the relationship with had been aware that the CEOs
of FTX and Alameda Research were romantically involved. “People never
see what they’re not looking for,” said Sam. Now they didn’t see that
the romance had ended. Having hidden the relationship, Sam now hid that
he’d broken it off, along with the fact that he was living in a
different place than everyone assumed he was living. At that moment he
was, in a funny way, making a truth of two lies. As it happened, it was
the moment before crypto prices crashed. And also, oddly enough, the
moment that I turned up to watch.</p>
