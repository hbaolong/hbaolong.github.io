<h4 id="yup">1 Yup</h4>
<p>Most of the people who went to work for Sam Bankman-Fried ended up in
jobs for which they were not obviously qualified, and Natalie Tien was
no exception. She’d been raised in Taiwan by middle-class parents whose
only real hope for her was that she’d find a rich husband. She was small
and agreeable and ill-designed for rebellion. She still reflexively
covered her mouth with her hand when she laughed. And yet she’d been
determined to prove to her parents that they’d underestimated her. After
college she’d gone hunting not for a husband but for work. She’d been so
anxious about her own ambition that, before each interview, she’d write
out and memorize exactly what she wanted to say about herself. She’d
landed the first real job she’d applied for, at an English-language
training company, and it had bored her to tears. But then, in 2018, at
the age of twenty-eight, she’d discovered crypto.</p>
<p>The previous year, the price of bitcoin had risen almost twentyfold,
from ,000 to 9,000, and the daily trading volumes had boomed by some
massive amount that was hard to precisely quantify. (The closest thing
to an accurate accounting of what occurred was from the Coinbase crypto
exchange, where trading volume in 2017 was thirty times greater than in
2016.) Across Asia, new cryptocurrency exchanges were popping up every
month to service the growing gambling public. They all had deep pockets
and an insatiable demand for young women. “Requirements are: pretty, big
boobs, have done live streaming before, born in 2000 or later, good at
chitchatting,” read the job ad for a salesperson at the fastest-growing
new exchange. By 2018 a lot of young Asian women were trying to meet
those requirements. Natalie took a different approach. She spent a month
reading everything she could find about cryptocurrencies and
blockchains. “Everyone called it a scam,” she said, and she worried
about that. Once on the inside, she was struck by how few of the people
who worked in crypto could explain what a bitcoin was. The businesses
themselves didn’t always know what they were doing, or why. They were
hiring lots of people because they could afford to, and big headcounts
signaled their importance. What kept Natalie going, and ignoring the
feeling that whatever talent she might possess was being wasted, was her
feeling that crypto might be the next big thing. “I thought of it as a
gamble with nothing to lose,” she said.</p>
<p>By June of 2020 she was working for her second Asian crypto exchange
when she heard about the opening at FTX. Like the other exchanges, FTX
hired her quickly, after a single interview, and she became the
company’s forty-ninth employee. FTX was different from the other
exchanges, mainly because the guy who ran it, Sam Bankman-Fried, was
different. Every man Natalie Tien had ever met in crypto had been
chiefly interested in money and women, and Sam was chiefly interested in
neither—though it took her a while to figure out what it was he was
chiefly interested in. Everything here is five times, she thought. Five
times more work, five times more growth, five times more money, five
times more responsibility. No one came out and said that you had to work
all the time, or that there was no room for a life outside work, but
anyone at FTX who tried to live a normal life simply didn’t stick.
Natalie stuck, and within months of moving to FTX’s Hong Kong offices
found herself named head of the company’s public relations. What was
peculiar about this—apart from the fact that she had no real experience
in public relations—was that FTX had no public relations. “When I
joined, Sam didn’t believe in PR,” said Natalie. “He thought it was all
bullshit.”</p>
<p>At the start, Natalie found herself trying to persuade Sam that he
should talk to journalists, while at the same time trying to persuade
journalists that they should talk to Sam. “In July 2020 no journalist
was interested in Sam,” she said. “Zip.” The mania for crypto recalled
Rotterdam circa 1637, when a single tulip bulb traded for roughly triple
the price of a Rembrandt. And every day more of it was being traded on
FTX. And Natalie kept pushing on journalists, and on Sam.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 11, 2021, Sam Bankman-Fried made his first
television appearance. He sat at his trading desk and talked into his
computer screen to two female reporters on Bloomberg TV. Thick black
curls exploded off his head in every direction. People who tried to
describe Sam’s hair would give up and call it an “afro,” but it wasn’t
an Afro. It was just a mess, and like everything about Sam’s appearance
felt less like a decision than a decision not to make a decision. He
wore what he always wore: a wrinkled T-shirt and cargo shorts. His bare
knee jackhammered up and down at roughly four beats per second, while
his eyes darted left and right and collided with his interviewers’ gaze
only by chance. His general demeanor was that of a kid pretending to be
interested when his parents hauled him into the living room to meet
their friends. He’d done nothing to prepare, but the questions were so
easy that it didn’t matter. Crypto Wunderkind, read the Bloomberg
chyron, while the numbers on the left of the screen showed that, in just
the past year, bitcoin’s price had risen by more than 500 percent.</p>
<p>That first TV show Natalie watched from her own desk, but later,
during future interviews, she’d walk around behind Sam to confirm that,
yes, his eyes moved around so much because he was playing a video game.
On live TV! Often, on live TV, Sam would not only play a video game but
respond to messages, edit documents, and tweet. The TV interviewer would
ask him a question and Sam would say, “Ahhhh, interesting question”—even
though he never found any of the questions interesting. And Natalie knew
he was just buying time to exit whatever game he was playing and reenter
the conversation. Natalie didn’t know how a person was supposed to
behave on live television, but she suspected it wasn’t like this. Yet
even as she watched Sam’s first television performance she sensed it
might play well. Sam was odd on TV, but he was also odd in real life. In
real life people who encountered him often thought he was the most
interesting person they’d ever met. She decided against media
training—or anything that might make Sam seem less like Sam.</p>
<p>Not long after that first Bloomberg interview, Forbes magazine showed
up. Back in 2017, when Forbes had begun to track crypto fortunes, Sam’s
name hadn’t even made the list of people whose fortunes they should
track; but back in 2017, Sam could not have told you what a bitcoin was,
and in any case he had been worth approximately zero dollars. “He kind
of came out of nowhere,” said Steve Ehrlich, the reporter Forbes
assigned to figure out the net worth of this twenty-nine-year-old
nobody. “It shocked me. It wasn’t that he had bought bitcoin and it had
gone from zero to twenty thousand.” Inside of three years, it appeared,
Sam Bankman-Fried had created a business so valuable that his share of
it implied that he was now the richest person in the world under the age
of thirty. “When I first looked at the numbers, I was like, Can this
really be true—can this guy really be worth twenty billion dollars?”
said Chase Peterson-Withorn, who led the Forbes team of investigators.
“It was pretty much unprecedented. No one else had gotten richer faster
except for Mark Zuckerberg, and it was very close.”</p>
<p>From that question they soon jumped to another: Exactly how much more
than twenty billion dollars might this guy be worth? In addition to the
crypto exchange, FTX, Sam also owned and controlled a crypto quant
trading firm called Alameda Research. The year before, 2020, with just a
handful of employees, Alameda had generated a billion dollars in trading
profits, and was accumulating stakes in other companies, and crypto
tokens, at a bewildering rate. The closer you got to Alameda Research,
the less it seemed like a hedge fund and the more it resembled a
dragon’s lair, stuffed with random treasures. The Forbes wealth analysts
had always tried to keep things simple: your assets were worth only what
other people were willing to pay for them. That approach had worked
during the dot-com bubble, when everyone could agree that even though
Pets.com was ridiculous it was still worth 00 million, because investors
were willing to buy it at that valuation. But with these new crypto
fortunes, the Forbes approach to wealth only got you so far. What to do,
for instance, with the Solana tokens Sam owned inside of Alameda
Research? Hardly anyone knew what Solana was—a new cryptocurrency minted
to rival Bitcoin—much less how to value it. On the one hand, the current
market price implied that Sam’s Solana stash was worth maybe 2 billion;
on the other hand, Sam owned roughly 10 percent of all the Solana in the
world. It was hard to know what anyone would pay for it if Sam tried to
sell it all. Forbes pretty much just ignored Sam’s Solana holdings,
along with most of the rest of the contents of his dragon’s lair.</p>
<p>As Sam went back and forth with the Forbes reporters, he—and
Natalie—worried mainly that they’d publish a number that would require
him to explain more than he wanted to explain. He’d walked the Forbes
people through what they knew, or thought they knew. “There were two
reasons I talked to them,” he said. “First, it was going to be in there
anyway. And second, it makes them trust us more.” Still, he was worried
that if he told Forbes everything, they might tell everyone that he was
as rich as he thought himself to be. “I didn’t just send them the
number: here’s what I’m worth,” he said. “It would set the wrong tone.
The number was too big. If it comes out in Forbes that I’m worth one
hundred billion dollars, it’s going to be weird and it’s going to fuck
things up.” He hadn’t sent them the list of the one hundred or so
businesses he’d acquired over the previous two years, for example. His
story might be fantastic, but he needed it to be believable.</p>
<p>It turned out that Sam had nothing to worry about. In November 2021,
Forbes listed his net worth at 2.5 billion, a notch below Rupert Murdoch
and a notch above Laurene Powell Jobs. Twenty-two and a half billion
dollars was roughly what you got if you simply agreed with the world’s
leading venture capital firms that FTX’s crypto exchange business by
itself was worth 0 billion. Sam owned 60 percent of FTX: 60 percent of 0
billion was 4 billion. Still, in the forty years since Forbes began
tracking rich people’s money, he was an outlier. “He was the richest
self-made newcomer to the Forbes list, ever,” said Peterson-Withorn.
“And we could easily have justified a much bigger number. We tried to be
conservative.” Sam’s number was so believable that Forbes’s executives
were soon asking if he might like to buy their company, too.</p>
<p>When Sam saw the response to the Forbes billionaires list, and the
Forbes cover that followed, any doubts he had about the value of public
relations evaporated. Natalie’s job became both simpler and more
complicated. Simpler, because basically everyone now wanted to talk to
Sam, and Sam was game to talk to anyone—so long as he could play a video
game while doing it. Sam went from being totally private to being a
media whore. He was as happy to yak for an hour in a completely
unguarded way with the reporter from the Westwego Crypto Daily as he was
to speak with the New York Times. Natalie compiled lists for Sam, with
notes on the hundred or so journalists likely to walk into his field of
vision, and advice on how to handle them. For example: “This person is
just, like, an asshole so be very careful with him.” Or: “You can’t
avoid the Financial Times guy but be very cautious around anyone from
the Financial Times because the Financial Times is very
anti-crypto.”</p>
<p>Being the head of public relations for a booming multinational
corporation wasn’t all that difficult. “You just do and learn at the
same time,” Natalie said brightly. The hard part of her job was Sam. The
demand for his time soon reached the point that Natalie took on a second
role, as Sam’s personal scheduler. It always had been Natalie the
Financial Times reporter was meant to call if he wanted to set a time
with Sam; now it was Natalie Sam’s father also needed to call if he
hoped to get fifteen minutes with his son. By the end of 2021 Natalie,
and Natalie alone, knew where Sam was at any given moment, and where he
might next go, and how to get him to do what he needed to do. She didn’t
actually have all that much in common with her boss, but to do her job
she had to be inside his head. “You need to learn how to get along with
him,” she said. “And it’s kind of mysterious how to get along with
him.”</p>
<p>A year into her job, Natalie had become as good as anyone at
predicting what Sam might do, and why. And yet even to Natalie, Sam
remained a puzzle. She could never be sure where he was, for a start.
“Don’t expect that he’ll tell you where he’s going to be at when,” said
Natalie. “He’ll never tell you. You need to be smart and fast to find
out by yourself.” And Sam might be anywhere, at any hour. She’d book him
a room for two nights at the Four Seasons in Washington, DC, and Sam
might even check in, but never enter the room. He had more trouble with
sleep than anyone she’d ever known. At two in the morning, she might
find him at his desk talking to some journalist halfway around the
world, or wandering around some deserted street tweeting up a storm, or
really anyplace but in his bed. But then at two in the afternoon, when
he was meant to be on live television, he might be asleep on the beanbag
chair beside his desk. “There is not such a thing as on times and off
times with him,” said Natalie. There had been nights Natalie had gone to
bed at 3:00 a.m., set an alarm for 7:00, woken up to see what public
relations shitstorm Sam might have caused in the interim, set a second
alarm for 8:00, checked again, then set another alarm and fallen back to
sleep until 9:30.</p>
<p>Sam’s approach to his commitments was an even bigger issue. Natalie
mapped out every minute of Sam’s days—not just the TV appearances but
the meetings with other CEOs, and curious celebrities, and rulers of
small countries. She put nothing on Sam’s schedule that he had not
agreed to. More often than not, it was Sam who had suggested some
meeting or public appearance. And yet Sam treated everything on his
schedule as optional. The schedule was less a plan than a theory. When
people asked Sam for his time, they assumed they’d posed a yes or no
question, and the noises Sam made always sounded more like “yes” than
like “no.” They didn’t know that inside Sam’s mind was a dial, with zero
on one end and one hundred on the other. All he had done, when he said
yes, was to assign some non-zero probability to the proposed use of his
time. The dial would swing wildly as he calculated and recalculated the
expected value of each commitment, right up until the moment he honored
it or didn’t. “He’ll never tell you what he’s going to do,” explained
Natalie. “You have to always be prepared it’s going to change every
second.” Every decision Sam made involved an expected value calculation.
The numbers in Sam’s mind were always shifting. One midnight, for
instance, he had sent Natalie a message that read: “There’s a 60 percent
chance I’ll go to Texas tomorrow.” “What does that mean, a sixty percent
chance?” asked Natalie. “I can’t book sixty percent of an airplane and
sixty percent of a car, or sixty percent of a hotel room in Texas.”</p>
<p>Of course, she didn’t say that to Sam directly. Instead, she tried to
anticipate the shifting odds before Sam made his calculations. She
learned to humor the professor at Harvard, for example, by saying, “Yes,
Sam told me he agreed to come and speak to a room full of important
Harvard people at two next Friday. It’s on his schedule.” Yet even as
she uttered those words, she’d already invented the excuse she’d make to
that same Harvard person, likely next Thursday night, to explain why Sam
would be nowhere near Massachusetts. Sam has Covid. The prime minister
needed to see Sam. Sam is stuck in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>The funny thing about these situations was that Sam never really
meant to cause them, which in a way made them feel even more insulting.
He didn’t mean to be rude. He didn’t mean to create chaos in other
people’s lives. He was just moving through the world in the only way he
knew how. The cost this implied for others simply never entered his
calculations. With him it was never personal. If he stood you up, it was
never on a whim, or the result of thoughtlessness. It was because he’d
done some math in his head that proved that you weren’t worth the time.
“You’re always going to be apologizing to different people, and you’ll
do that every day,” said Natalie.</p>
<p>Natalie loved her job. Sam had never once been cruel or abusive or
even flirty. Just the opposite: she felt protected by him from the abuse
of others. He’d occasionally surprise her with some kindness—for
example, after he’d met privately with President Clinton, and asked him
what the United States might do if China invaded Taiwan. Whatever
Clinton had told Sam had prompted him to seek her out afterward and
suggest that she move her parents out of Taiwan. Sam seldom even
disagreed with her. He’d invariably seem open to her ideas—and
sometimes, as with Bloomberg TV, he’d actually do what she suggested.
“Yup,” he’d always say. “Yup” was Sam’s go-to word, and the less he’d
actually listened to whatever you’d just said, the longer he drew it
out. Yuuuuuuuuup. “He’s not direct, most of the time,” said Natalie.
“He’ll say ‘yup’ or ‘that’s interesting’ and he doesn’t really mean
that. So you need to figure out when he is just avoiding conflict, and
when he means it.”</p>
<p>By early 2022 Sam’s situation was totally out of hand. Every
important person on the planet seemed to want to get to know him. He had
said yes to them all. Anyone else in Sam’s situation would have built
out a huge network of schedulers and advisors and gatekeepers. Sam had
only Natalie, who was no longer just Sam’s public relations head and
Sam’s private scheduler but, on occasion, Sam’s bodyguard. She was a
circus juggler with a thousand balls in the air. No one ball was all
that important, but Natalie sensed that any given ball, if dropped,
might trigger a cascading crisis. And on the morning of February 14, one
of those balls had her especially worried.</p>
<p>Three days earlier, Sam had boarded a private plane in the Bahamas
bound for Los Angeles, with nothing but his laptop and a change of
underwear. Since then, he’d had brunch with Shaquille O’Neal and dinner
with the Kardashians, and had watched the Super Bowl with the owner of
the Los Angeles Rams. He’d chatted with Hillary Clinton and Orlando
Bloom. He’d attended four parties and had met with entrepreneurs who
wanted him to buy their businesses, and also with the CEO of Goldman
Sachs, who was eager to get to know Sam better. For the previous three
nights Natalie hadn’t been entirely sure where, or if, Sam had slept,
but she knew he’d checked into the room she’d booked for him at the
Beverly Hilton, because she’d watched him do it.</p>
<p>Now, on the fourteenth, the hotel room looked as if he’d never
arrived. The sheets were still crisp, the pillows undented, the trash
cans empty, the bathroom sparkling. The only sign of a human presence in
the room was Sam himself. He sat at the desk in the same wrinkled
T-shirt and baggy cargo shorts he’d worn on the plane ride in. As
always, he was doing several things at once: checking his phone,
applying ChapStick to his perpetually parched lips, opening and closing
windows on his laptop—all while his knee jackhammered at four beats a
second. His assigned task—the one Natalie had reminded him about the
night before, and again this morning—was being on time for his Zoom
meeting. He was already late. Yet another very important person who
really wanted to meet him was waiting for him inside his laptop.</p>
<p>“Hey, this is Sam!” said Sam, to his laptop, as his Zoom box
opened.</p>
<p>Onto his screen popped Anna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue
magazine. She wore a tight yellow dress and careful makeup and a bob cut
so sharply that its fringes plunged and curved down around her face like
the blades of two scythes. “I’m so happy to finally meet you!” she
said.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s great to meet you too!” Sam replied.</p>
<p>Sam didn’t really know who Anna Wintour was. Natalie and others had
briefed him, but he hadn’t paid attention. He knew Anna Wintour edited a
magazine. He might or might not have been dimly aware that Meryl Streep
had played her in The Devil Wears Prada, and that she’d ruled the
treacherous world of women’s fashion since—well, since before Sam was
born. She looked like a million bucks, but her art, like all art, was
wasted on Sam. When you asked Sam to describe a person’s appearance—even
a person he’d slept with—he’d say, “I don’t really know how to answer
that. I’m not good at judging how people look.”</p>
<p>As Anna Wintour began to speak, he clicked a button and she vanished
from his screen. In her place popped his favorite video game, Storybook
Brawl. He had only a few seconds to choose his character. He picked the
Hoard Dragon. The Hoard Dragon was maybe Sam’s favorite hero to
play.</p>
<p>“Yup,” said Sam, to whatever Anna Wintour was saying. He could still
hear her through headphones. Unless she watched his eyes, she had no
reason to think that he wasn’t paying attention. Sam didn’t want to seem
rude. It was just that he needed to be playing this other game at the
same time as whatever game he had going in real life. His new social
role as the world’s most interesting new child billionaire required him
to do all kinds of dumb stuff. He needed something, other than what he
was expected to be thinking about, to occupy his mind. And so, oddly,
the more important he became in the eyes of the world, the more
important these games became to him.</p>
<p>Storybook Brawl had everything Sam loved in a game. It pitted him
against live opponents. It required him to make lots of decisions
quickly. Games without clocks bored Sam. It energized him to have
seconds ticking away as he assembled his platoon of fantasy
characters—dwarves, witches, monsters, princesses, and so on. Each
character came with two numbers attached to it: how much damage it could
inflict on other characters and how much damage it could itself survive.
Each also had more complex traits—for example, the ability to cast
random spells, or to interact in peculiar ways with specific treasures
it collected along the way, or to strengthen comrades in some
quantifiable way. The game was too complicated to know with certainty
its optimal moves. It required skill, but also luck. It required him to
estimate probabilities, but also to guess. This was important; Sam
didn’t care for games, like chess, where the players controlled
everything and the best move was in theory perfectly calculable. Chess
he’d have liked better if robot voices wired into the board hollered
rule changes at random intervals. Knights are now rooks! All bishops
must leave the board! Pawns can now fly! Or almost anything—so long as
the new rule forced all players to scrap whatever strategy they’d been
pursuing and improvise another, better one. The games Sam loved allowed
for only partial knowledge of any situation. Trading crypto was like
that.</p>
<p>“Yuuuuuup,” said Sam, to whatever Anna Wintour had just said. His
dwarf platoon, to which he’d added a princess or two, was defending the
Hoard Dragon. At the same time, it was attacking its new foe, his
opponent’s hero, a fat white penguin named Wonder Waddle. A dwarf named
Crafty assaulted a sad-looking wimp called the Lonely Prince. Sleeping
Princess wiped out the Labyrinth Minotaur. A sleeping maiden awakened to
cast a spell that caused a dying character to turn into three
arbitrarily generated living ones. So much was happening all at once! It
would have been impossible for him to follow the action, even if that
were all he was following.</p>
<p>“Yuuuuuuuuup,” said Sam. The noises the woman was making were still
entirely ceremonial. No real content here. But each of Sam’s yups was
warmer, more animated, than the last. And she was clearly warming to
him. Everyone did these days. When you had 2.5 billion, people really,
really wanted to be your friend. They’d forgive you anything. Their
desire freed you up from having to pay attention to them, which was
good, because Sam had only so much attention to give. Another battle was
about to begin. As the seconds ticked down, he hastily selected a new
army of killer trees and dwarves. At the same time, he pulled up a
document: the notes Natalie had created for this very meeting. Sam now
looked them over for the first time. Anna Wintour was definitely the
editor of Vogue magazine.</p>
<p>“That’s interesting,” he said, as the battle commenced. Again, it was
over in seconds. Already the Hoard Dragon was in trouble. Its health
number was declining faster than the competition’s. A lot of the heroes
were front-loaded; the Hoard Dragon was one of the rare ones that
acquired its special powers only later in its life. The way to play the
Hoard Dragon was to buy treasures that paid off more for it than for any
other hero—but the payoff came way down the road, like eight battles
later. In the meantime, you were diverting resources from the battle at
hand. Sam didn’t need to win these early battles. He just needed to keep
the Hoard Dragon alive long enough to enjoy the future gargantuan
payoffs from the treasures he was accumulating. Anna Wintour was making
that difficult. She wanted so much attention! And she was arriving at
the reason for the call: the Met Gala. Organized by Vogue magazine. But
rather than simply explain it to him and leave him in peace, she asked
Sam what he knew about it.</p>
<p>Sam shifted in his chair. From his wrinkled cargo shorts he pulled
his ChapStick. He twiddled it. Valuable seconds ticked away. Finally, he
hit a button. The Hoard Dragon vanished, and Anna Wintour reappeared.
Curiously, only when he was talking did he want to see her.</p>
<p>“I don’t know as much about your industry as obviously you do,” he
said, cautiously. “I know some of the public information, but I don’t
know much of the behind-the-scenes information.” Some information.
Strictly speaking, that was true: Sam knew some information. He knew
that the Met Gala was a party. Attended by celebrities. Beyond that, he
didn’t know much. For example, he could not have told you if the “Met”
was the Metropolitan Opera or the Metropolitan Museum or, for that
matter, the Metropolitan Police.</p>
<p>Anna Wintour was clearly used to this situation. To Sam’s great
relief, she now began to explain the thing. The moment she opened her
mouth, Sam switched out her face for a page from Wikipedia:</p>
<p>The Met Gala, formally called the Costume Institute Gala or the
Costume Institute Benefit and also known as the Met Ball, is an annual
fundraising gala for the benefit of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s
Costume Institute in New York City. It marks the opening of the Costume
Institute’s annual fashion exhibit.[4] Each year’s event celebrates the
theme of that year’s Costume Institute exhibition, and the exhibition
sets the tone for the formal dress of the night, since guests are
expected to choose their fashion to match the theme of the exhibit.</p>
<p>“Interesting!” said Sam. “That’s super interesting.” But even as he
expressed this interest, he pressed a button that caused the Wikipedia
page to vanish. In its place appeared an enormous golden tomahawk. The
Hoard Dragon was hanging by a thread. Another battle was about to begin,
against a character named Peter Pants. Peter Pants was the opposite of
the Hoard Dragon. Peter Pants was a make-or-break character whose powers
dwindled over time. Peter Pants was all about killing you quickly. Peter
Pants might finish off the Hoard Dragon in a single battle. Sam had only
a few seconds to organize his fighting force. He needed to focus. Anna
Wintour was making that impossible.</p>
<p>“Yuuuup,” said Sam.</p>
<p>Anna Wintour now said she wanted to hear more about what FTX had
done, giving-money-away-wise. Compelled to speak, Sam allowed her face
to return to his computer screen. “We’ve done sponsorship deals with
some places,” he said. “But it’s somewhat of an accident what we jumped
into first. We really try to look hard at what partnerships would be
most impactful. That’s why we’ve partnered with Tom and Gisele.”
Partnered. Again, strictly true. It didn’t capture the spirit of the
relationship. Sam had agreed to pay Tom Brady 5 million, and his
then-wife, Gisele Bündchen, another 9.8 million, for twenty hours of
their time each, over the next three years. Sam was paying people more
money per minute than anyone had ever paid them to do anything in their
entire lives. He’d paid Larry David 0 million to create a sixty-second
ad—over and above the 5 million the ad cost to produce and air during
the Super Bowl—which Sam had watched just the day before. It was a great
ad.</p>
<p>The Hoard Dragon was dying.</p>
<p>Sam might not have been entirely sure what the Met Gala was, or
exactly what role he might play in it, but he could sense what Anna
Wintour was after. She didn’t want only his money; she wanted him.
Present, on her Met Gala red carpet, beside her, creating buzz. Sam also
understood what he might get in return for his sacrifice: women. Or,
rather, access to the female crypto speculator. FTX had spent vast sums
to capture the minds of men. Fashion, to Sam’s way of thinking, occupied
roughly the same place in the female imagination that sports did in the
male imagination. He’d asked some marketing people for a list of things
he might do in fashion to appeal to women. The Met Gala was on the list.
And so here he was, on a Zoom call with Anna Wintour herself, who now
seemed to be hinting that Sam might pay for the entire shindig.</p>
<p>“Yeah, absolutely,” said Sam, but his mind was elsewhere. The Hoard
Dragon was dead. Anna Wintour had killed it. What to do? He made a
half-hearted bid to begin another game and pick another hero but then
changed his mind and shut the game down. He could often occupy two
worlds at once and win in both. In this case he clearly stood no chance
of winning in one world unless he paid less attention in the other. And
this woman somehow had acquired a spell that interfered with his
abilities to multitask. For now she was asking him not only for his
money and his time. She wanted to know all about his political
activities.</p>
<p>“My mom is working full-time on the effectiveness of political
campaign donations, and my brother is in DC with policymakers,” Sam
said, returning Anna Wintour’s face to his laptop. “We’re doing a decent
amount to see just how hard we can make it to steal an election. It’s
sad that’s the forum we have to fight in, but it is.”</p>
<p>For a surprisingly long time, Sam’s spending on American elections
had flown under the radar. Back in 2020, he’d sent .2 million to Joe
Biden’s presidential campaign without anyone asking or even thanking him
for it. He was Biden’s second- or third-biggest donor, and yet the
campaign had never even bothered to call him. Since then, Sam had tossed
tens of millions more dollars at one hundred different candidates and
political action committees (PACs), in ways that made his identity
difficult to detect. It was yet another game—How to Influence American
Politics—that he was learning by doing, and it was pretty fun,
especially when you had the special power of invisibility. But then he
“fucked up,” as he put it. He let it slip in some interview that he was
thinking of hurling a billion dollars into the next presidential
election. That remark had awakened the beast. And now Anna Wintour was
professing her love for Pete Buttigieg. She was asking where, exactly,
Sam planned to be in the next few weeks. To talk more about Pete
Buttigieg.</p>
<p>“I certainly would love an introduction,” said Sam. “He’s someone who
I’d love to see as president.” If he thought that would satisfy Anna
Wintour, he was wrong. She wanted to nail down a place in the real world
where Sam might be, and a time he might be there.</p>
<p>“I’m in the Bahamas sixty percent of the time,” said Sam, neatly
evading the question. “I’m in DC some. For better or worse, my job is
now thirty percent telling the regulators about what regulation should
look like for crypto in the United States.” His bare left leg now curled
under his bottom on the hotel desk chair; his right heel, encased in a
white athletic sock, bounced up and down off the hotel carpet. He looked
less like a crypto tycoon than a first grader who needed to pee. But now
Anna Wintour was talking again, thank God. Liberated, he scrolled
through his Twitter feed. Two nights earlier, Sam had been introduced to
Katy Perry. Katy Perry had wanted to know all about crypto. Now she was
posting on Instagram: “im quitting music and becoming an intern for
<span class="citation" data-cites="ftx_official">@ftx_official</span> ok
.”</p>
<p>Anna Wintour’s tone was changing. She had gotten what she came for
and was now warmly ending the conversation. To be free of her, all Sam
needed to do was make his usual sounds of total agreement with whatever
she said.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Awesome!</p>
<p>That makes a ton of sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would love to!</p>
<p>See ya!</p>
<p>With that, Sam hit a button and Anna Wintour was gone for good. With
the understandable impression that Sam Bankman-Fried, the most
openhanded billionaire ever to have walked the earth, had agreed to be
her special guest at the Met Gala. That Sam might even pay for the
entire thing. Sam, for his part, hadn’t really thought about it. He’d
not even begun to do his Met Gala math. “I would have to think hard if
this is a thing I want to go to,” he said, as he stowed his laptop in
his backpack with his spare underwear and headed for the door of his Los
Angeles hotel room, on his way back to the Bahamas. “I would certainly
be out of place there. It’s going to be a difficult needle to
thread.”</p>
<p>In the ensuing weeks, Sam gave Anna Wintour’s people no reason to
think he was doing anything but threading needles. FTX’s marketing
people sounded out Louis Vuitton about creating a red-carpet-worthy
version of Sam’s T-shirt and cargo shorts look. Other FTX employees,
perhaps hedging the company’s bets, paid Tom Ford to design a more
conventional outfit, complete with sixty-five-thousand-dollar cuff
links. Behind the scenes, wheels spun and gears ground but Sam himself
never really engaged with the process, or even said what was on his
mind. He viewed the entire list of fashion plays dreamed up by the FTX
marketing people with suspicion. “I have no idea which of these things
matters and which doesn’t,” he said. “It’s not clear that there is any
way to know.”</p>
<p>His whole life, as far back as he could remember, he’d been perplexed
by the way people allowed physical appearance to shape their lives. “You
start by making decisions on who you are going to be with based on how
they look,” he said. “Then, because of that, you make bad choices about
religion and food and everything else. Then you are just rolling the
dice on who you are going to be.” Anna Wintour, now that he thought of
it, represented much of what he disliked about human beings. “There are
very few businesses that I have strong moral objections to, and hers is
one of them,” he said. “I actually have disdain for fashion. I have
general disdain for the importance that physical attractiveness has, and
this is one thing emanating out of that.”</p>
<p>Very briefly, Sam set aside his disdain for the fashion industry and
tried to do some math. Four billion women on the planet. Let’s say one
in a thousand of them pays attention to the Met Gala. Let’s say one in a
hundred of those gets interested in FTX … But it felt like trying to
comb his hair when he had chewing gum stuck in it. His mind couldn’t
even really get past the need for him to change out of his cargo shorts.
And yet he allowed the decision to just sit there, festering, for
months. The Met Gala would not occur until May 2. In Sam’s mind he had
until roughly the night of May 1 before he had to tell Natalie what he
planned to do.</p>
<p>Natalie Tien was prepared for Anna Wintour’s people to be
disappointed when she told them that Sam wouldn’t be there. It was their
outrage that surprised her. “They called and shouted and said Sam will
never set foot in fashion again!” said Natalie. So much for pulling more
women into crypto. Natalie didn’t understand why the Met Gala was such a
big deal. Sam’s last-minute decision not to go would not create anything
like the havoc caused by some of his other internal calculations. CEOs
had flown to the Bahamas under the mistaken impression that Sam had
agreed to buy their companies. The World Economic Forum had to scramble
to fill a stage and cancel media interviews after Sam decided, the night
before he was meant to deliver a big speech in Davos, not to. Sam had
failed to fly to Dubai to give the keynote at Time magazine’s party for
the world’s 100 Most Influential People, even after Time had named him
to their list and flattered him in print. “In a crypto landscape ridden
with scams, hedonism, and greed, Bankman-Fried offers a kinder and more
impactful vision brought forth by the nascent technology,” Time had
written, the week before Sam stiffed them. Tyra Banks and will.i.am and
all the rest of the world’s other most influential people were treated
to hastily prepared remarks delivered by a not entirely sober FTX
employee named Adam Jacobs, who was bewildered to be standing in for
Sam. “I’m like, What is the head of payments doing giving this speech?”
said Jacobs. “Why am I drinking with will.i.am?”</p>
<p>But the people at Time magazine hadn’t made a stink. No one except
Anna Wintour’s people did: the general rule of life as late as May 2,
2022, was that Sam got to be Sam. It didn’t cross Natalie’s mind to feel
even a tiny bit irritated with Sam. She could never be upset with him
for the mess he left for her to clean up, because she knew that he never
intended to make a mess. She could even forgive people who called to
scream at her about Sam. If she herself didn’t fully understand Sam, how
could anyone?</p>
