<h4 id="the-santa-claus-problem">2 The Santa Claus Problem</h4>
<p>When I’d asked Sam for a list of people who could describe what he
was like before the age of eighteen, he’d taken a deep breath and said,
“That’s slim pickings.” He suggested his parents, Joe Bankman and
Barbara Fried. He mentioned that he had a younger brother, Gabe. Apart
from that, he said, he had no early relationships that would cast any
light on him, and there were no experiences in his childhood that
mattered much. “I’m a little confused about my childhood,” he said. “I
just can’t figure out what I did with it. I look at the things I did,
and I cannot successfully add up to twenty-four hours a day. I
daydreamed some. I read some books. I played some video games, but that
wasn’t until high school. I had one or two friends I’d hang out with now
and again.” The names of those friends, with one exception, would not
ever spring to mind. He was happy to supply me with his date of birth:
March 5, 1992. Beyond that, he didn’t have much to say, and didn’t think
his childhood had anything to say about him—which struck me as odd, as
he had spent roughly two-thirds of his life in it.</p>
<p>He’d gone to school for thirteen years with other children. He’d been
admitted to colleges, which would have required teachers to write him
recommendations. His parents were well-known professors. Most Sundays,
I’d learn, Joe and Barbara hosted a dinner that guests remember fondly
to this day. “The conversation was intoxicating,” recalls Tino Cuéllar,
a Stanford law professor who would go on to become a judge on
California’s supreme court and then head of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. “Fifteen percent of it was what was going on in
your life, fifteen percent was politics, and the rest was ideas. How we
thought about what we thought about—aesthetics, music, whatever.” Sam
had been at those dinners but could not think of any one of their guests
who’d be worth my talking to. Pressed, he suggested I call his brother,
who was now employed by Sam to distribute Sam’s money to political
candidates. Gabe, three years younger, told me that I was wasting my
time. “We weren’t close growing up,” he said, when I reached him. “I
don’t think Sam liked school that much, but I don’t really know. He kept
to himself. I would interact with him as another tenant in my
house.”</p>
<p>Sam’s parents were only a bit more helpful. Sam had been their first
child, and so it had taken them longer than it might have to figure out
that there was no point in parenting him by any book. “Childhood was a
funny thing for Sam,” said Joe. “He was never comfortable with kids, or
with being a kid.” They’d briefly attempted to inflict upon him a normal
childhood before realizing that there was no point. The trip to the
amusement park was a good example. When Sam was a small child, his
mother had located a Six Flags or Great America park. She’d hauled him
dutifully from amusement to amusement until she realized Sam wasn’t
amused. Instead of throwing himself into the rides, he was watching her.
“Are you having fun, Mom?” he asked finally, by which he meant, Is this
really your or anyone else’s idea of fun? “I realized I had been
busted,” said Barbara.</p>
<p>By the time Sam was eight she had given up on the idea that his wants
and needs would be anything like other children’s. She remembered the
instant that happened. She had been at Stanford for over a decade, a
frequent contributor of difficult papers to academic journals. “I was
walking him to school, and he asked me what I was doing,” recalled
Barbara. “I told him I was giving some paper, and he asked, ‘What’s it
on?’” I gave him a bullshit answer, and he pressed me on it, and by the
end of the walk we were in the middle of a deep conversation about the
argument. The points he was making were better than any of the
reviewers’. At that moment my parenting style changed.”</p>
<p>To their friends who came to dinner on Sunday nights, Joe was always
light, Barbara more serious. Joe was funny, Barbara trenchant. Gabe was
a bright and cheery little kid whom everyone loved. Sam was always a
presence, but he was quieter and more watchful and less accessible than
his little brother. To their dinner guests it seemed that Joe and
especially Barbara were both a little afraid for, and of, their elder
son. And that they were concerned about how he would ever fit into the
world. “We worried that Gabe’s light was going to shine, and Sam would
hide his under a bushel,” said Barbara.</p>
<p>Sam himself took a bit longer to recognize the gulf between himself
and other children. He didn’t really know why he didn’t have friends the
way other kids did. Between the ages of eight and ten, he was sideswiped
by a pair of realizations that, taken together, amounted to an epiphany.
The first came one December day during the third grade. Christmas was
approaching, and a few of his classmates brought up the critical subject
of Santa Claus.</p>
<p>The Bankman-Frieds weren’t big on the usual holidays. They celebrated
Hanukkah but with so little enthusiasm that one year they simply forgot
it, and, realizing that none of them cared, stopped celebrating
anything. “It was like, ‘Alright, who was bothered by this fact? The
fact that we forgot Hanukkah.’ No one raised their hand,” Sam said. They
didn’t do birthdays, either. Sam didn’t feel the slightest bit deprived.
“My parents were like, I dunno, ‘Is there something you want? Alright,
bring it up. And you can have it. Even in February. Doesn’t have to be
in December. If you want it, let’s have an open and honest conversation
about it instead of us trying to guess.’” Sam, like his parents, didn’t
see the point in anyone trying to imagine what someone else might want.
The family’s indifference to convention came naturally and
unselfconsciously. It was never, Look how interesting we are, we don’t
observe any of the rituals that define so many American lives. “It’s not
like they said, ‘Gifts are dumb,’” recalled Sam. “They never tried to
convince us about gifts. It didn’t happen like that.”</p>
<p>None of what the Bankman-Frieds did was for show; they weren’t that
kind of people. They just really thought about what they did before they
did it. In his twenties Sam would learn that his parents had never
married. In silent protest of the fact that their gay friends could not
legally marry, they’d joined in a civil union. And they never said a
word about it to their children, or to anyone else, as far as Sam could
tell. Later, Sam understood that “they were clearly being driven by a
different underlying belief system.” As a small child he knew only that
there were things other children took for granted that he did not. One
was Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Of course Sam was aware of Santa. “I’d like heard of it,” he said. “I
hadn’t thought that deeply about it.” He thought of Santa roughly the
same way he thought of cartoon characters. Bugs Bunny existed too, in
some sense, but Bugs Bunny wasn’t real. Now, at the age of eight, he
realized that other children believed that Santa was real, in a way that
Bugs Bunny was not. It blew his mind. He went home that afternoon, shut
himself in his room, and thought it over. “Imagine you had never been
introduced to the idea of Santa as a real thing,” said Sam. “And then
one day someone tells you that ninety-five percent of the people your
age in the world believe in him. That this guy lives in the North Pole
and has these elves. That he takes off with these flying reindeer. He
flies into your chimney and brings you presents. Unless you’ve been
naughty, in which case he brings coal. Though for some reason no one
actually knows anyone who has gotten coal. And he does this just once a
year. You’re like, ‘What the fuck? Where did that come from?’”</p>
<p>He found his way to a solution that offered temporary relief: only
children suffered from this madness. Yes, kids believed in Santa. But
grown-ups did not. There was a limit to the insanity. But then, a year
or so later, a boy in his class said he believed in God.</p>
<p>Sam had heard of God too. “God was like a thing on TV,” he said. “God
came up. But I didn’t think anyone actually believed in God.” It told
you something not just about Sam but about his upbringing that he could
live for almost ten years inside the United States of America without
realizing that other people believed in God. “I never asked myself, ‘Why
does God come up if no one believes in it?’” he said. “I had never gone
through that process before. I hadn’t drilled down into ‘Do people
believe in it?’” Now Henry was telling him not only that he believed in
God but that his parents did too. So did lots of other grown-ups. “And I
freaked out,” recalled Sam. “Then he freaked out. We both freaked out. I
remember thinking, Wait a minute, do you think I’m going to hell?
Because that seems like a big deal. If hell exists, why do you, like,
care about McDonald’s? Why are we talking about any of this shit, if
there is a hell. If it really exists. It’s fucking terrifying,
hell.”</p>
<p>This was Santa all over again, only worse. God—or rather the fact
that anyone believed in him—rocked Sam’s world. Just sideswiped his view
of other people and what was going on inside their minds. He tried to
confront adults—mainly friends of his parents’ who came to dinner—about
God. He always found it easier to talk to grown-ups than to children and
had always been better at it than other children—a fact he attributed to
the idiotic childishness of other children. His parents’ friends were at
their dinner table every Sunday, and available for inspection. “I’d ask
them, ‘Do you believe in God?’ They’d equivocate—like, say something
about a Being that started the Clock of the Universe. And I’d think,
Quit fucking around: it’s a binary question. Just yes or no.” He didn’t
understand the unwillingness of even really smart grown-ups to get the
right answer to this question. “It was weird to me,” he said. “I never
understood why people bothered pretending about this shit.”</p>
<p>From the widespread belief in God, and Santa, Sam drew a conclusion:
it was possible for almost everyone to be self-evidently wrong about
something. “Mass delusions are a property of the world, as it turns
out,” he said. He had to accept that there was nothing he could do about
this. There was no point in arguing with other kids’ belief in Santa
Claus. Yet he didn’t feel the slightest need to pretend to agree. He
simply came to terms with the fact that the world could be completely
wrong about something, and he could be completely right. There could be
a kind of equilibrium in which everyone in the world could remain wrong
and he could remain right, and neither side would even try to change the
other’s mind. “There are times when we’re just going to stare at each
other,” said Sam.</p>
<p>One interpretation of Sam’s childhood is that he was simply waiting
for it to end. That’s how he thought about it, more or less: that he was
holding his breath until other people grew up so he could talk to them.
“A lot of childhood just never made sense to me,” he said. “If you don’t
find it magical to think about Santa Claus then it’s just fucking dumb.”
Although he found it easier to talk with adults than with children, the
connections he made with the adults were no stronger than those he made
with other kids. In some deep way, he sensed, he remained cut off from
other human beings. He could read them, but they couldn’t read him.
“There were some things I had to teach myself to do,” he said. “One is
facial expressions. Like making sure I smile when I’m supposed to smile.
Smiling was the biggest thing that I most weirdly couldn’t do.” Other
people would say or do things to which he was meant to respond with some
emotional display. And instead of faking it, he questioned the premise.
What’s the whole point of facial expressions in the first place? If
you’re going to say something to me, just say it. Why do I have to grin
while you do it?</p>
<p>Very early on, Sam realized that he’d need to acquire abilities most
people just took for granted. But he also knew that he could take for
granted abilities that other people sweated to learn. When the teacher
said that Sally had thirteen apples in her basket, then picked twice as
many apples as she already had and added them to that same basket, Sam
knew faster than the other kids how many apples Sally had in her basket.
In kindergarten a teacher had suggested to Barbara and Joe that they
remove him from public school and enroll him in a school for gifted
kids. “We thought she was bats,” said Barbara. For the next seven years
they were given no reason to think they’d made a mistake. Right through
middle school Sam was a good but not great student, defined mainly by
his disinterest in whatever his teacher was saying. “I was obedient in
that I wouldn’t do shit I wasn’t supposed to do,” said Sam. “But I
wouldn’t necessarily do shit I was supposed to do. I would just be
sitting there in a stupor.”</p>
<p>It was in middle school that he became conscious of the fact that he
was not a happy person. Depression took many forms, and his was of the
low-level, simmering kind. “I think in general when people are depressed
they know they are depressed,” he said. “My form of it was not
out-of-control negative. My form of it was lack of positive.” He had a
fault line inside him, pressure was building on it, and one day, in the
seventh grade, it slipped. His mother returned from work to find Sam
alone, in despair. “I came home, and he was crying,” recalled Barbara.
“He said, ‘I’m so bored I’m going to die.’” Barbara and Joe organized a
small group of parents to beseech the school to offer an advanced math
class. The school relented and brought in a special teacher. “The class
met at seven,” recalled Barbara. “And for the first time Sam just jumped
out of bed at six thirty. Up till then there wasn’t a real clear
indicator that he was special.” It was then that Barbara and Joe decided
to spend the money to send him to a fancy private high school, Crystal
Springs Uplands.</p>
<p>Crystal Springs made no difference. “I hated it there too,” said Sam.
“The whole way through. I didn’t like classes. I didn’t like my
schoolmates. I was bored.” The student body was a who’s who of Silicon
Valley children. (Steve Jobs’s son, Reed, was in Sam’s class.) By most
standards it was a nerdy school. A jock was a person who ran track. To
Sam it still felt unserious. “It was a lot of moderately unambitious
really rich kids,” he said. “The one thing they knew is they didn’t have
to worry. So there was not a lot of drive, and not a lot of pressure.
Everyone went to Stanford.” He wanted to think about things the other
kids had no interest in—including thinking—and he had no interest in
what they wanted to think about. He didn’t even bother trying to fit in.
Everyone else carried a backpack; he alone showed up with a rolling bag
whose wheels thump-thump-thumped over the cobblestones as he moved from
class to class. When weaker students conferred before a test, they
sometimes tried to get him to join in, in the hope that he might save
them. Sam wanted no part of it. “He was like, ‘Sorry, you’re on your
own,’” recalled one classmate. “I think he felt above a lot of it. In
class he had the attitude of being above a lot of things. He was not
liked or disliked. He was just kind of there.” Said another classmate,
“He was the butt of jokes made by people who sort of pretended he was in
on them, but he wasn’t.” During the school campout Sam hadn’t even tried
to go to sleep. Everyone just thought that was weird. “I was viewed as
smart, as a nerd, not as a good guy or a bad guy,” said Sam. “Not really
viewed as a person. Smart and inoffensive and maybe not all that human.”
Worse, he didn’t totally disagree with his classmates’ assessment. “I
didn’t feel misunderstood. I felt like their half-assed guesses were in
the right ballpark.”</p>
<p>By high school Sam had decided that he just didn’t like school, which
was odd for a person who would finish at the top of his class. He’d also
decided that at least some of the fault lay not with him but with
school. English class, for instance. His doubts about English class
dated back to the sixth grade. That was when the teachers had stopped
worrying about simple literacy and turned their attention to deeper
questions. “As soon as English class went from ‘can you read a book’ to
writing an essay about a book, I completely lost interest,” recalled
Sam. He found literary criticism bizarre: Who cared what you felt or
thought about a story? The story was the story, with no provably right
or wrong way to read it. “If they said talk about what you like or don’t
like, okay, I would do that,” he said. That’s not what they were asking
him to do, however. They were asking him to interpret the book, and then
judging him on his interpretations.</p>
<p>In elementary school he’d read the Harry Potter books over and over.
By the eighth grade he had stopped reading books altogether. “You start
to associate it with a negative feeling, and you stop liking it,” he
said. “I started to associate books with a thing I didn’t like.” He kept
his thoughts about the literary-industrial establishment to himself
through middle school, but by high school they began to leak out of him.
“I objected to the fundamental reality of the entire class,” said Sam of
English. “All of a sudden I was being told I was wrong—about a thing it
was impossible to be wrong about. The thing that offended me is that it
wasn’t honest with itself. It was subjectivity framed as objectivity.
All the grading was arbitrary. I don’t even know how you grade it. I
disagreed with the implicit factual claims behind the things that got
good grades.” He’d sat through middle school in a stupor, but by high
school he was sure enough of his own mind that he was willing to
challenge his English teachers’ cherished beliefs on grounds
unrecognizable to English teachers. Their belief, for instance, that
Shakespeare was an especially good writer.</p>
<p>The plot twist in Much Ado About Nothing—typical of
Shakespeare—relies on, simultaneously, one-dimensional and unrealistic
characters, illogical plots and obvious endings. I mean, come on—kill
someone because he thinks, with good reason, that his fiancée is
cheating on him? Beatrice is absurdly out of line in an unrealistic way;
Benedick is absurd for listening to her, and this is all supposed to be
taken in stride.</p>
<p>To Sam’s way of thinking, the case against Shakespeare could be made
with basic statistics:</p>
<p>I could go on and on about the failings of Shakespeare … but really I
shouldn’t need to: the Bayesian priors are pretty damning. About half
the people born since 1600 have been born in the past 100 years, but it
gets much worse than that. When Shakespeare wrote almost all Europeans
were busy farming, and very few people attended university; few people
were even literate—probably as low as ten million people. By contrast
there are now upwards of a billion literate people in the Western
sphere. What are the odds that the greatest writer would have been born
in 1564? The Bayesian priors aren’t very favorable.fn1</p>
<p>That he still received good grades from his English teachers didn’t
lessen his skepticism of their enterprise. Why were they giving him an
A? Why were they giving any grade to anyone for what amounted to an
opinion? “I convinced the teachers that I was a good student, and thus I
got good grades,” he said. “It was self-fulfilling to a decent extent.”
They gave him an A because they didn’t want to explain why they didn’t
give him an A. All of humanities was like this for him: dopey stuff he
wanted mainly to escape but that somehow always lurked just around every
corner. In choosing a college to attend, Sam sought to ensure he’d never
again be made to write an essay about Jane Austen.</p>
<p>But even MIT, where he eventually landed, had a humanities
requirement. A single liberal arts class, which he satisfied by taking
film history, but even that grated on him. “Whatever cease-fire existed
earlier in my life was gone,” he said. “I was starting to get a little
bit of a whiff of ‘I don’t have to put up with it anymore.’” The very
first question on the final exam set him off. What’s the difference
between art and entertainment? “It’s a bullshit distinction dreamed up
by academics trying to justify the existence of their jobs,” wrote Sam,
and handed the exam back.</p>
<p>He felt nothing in the presence of art. He found religion absurd. He
thought both right-wing and left-wing political opinions kind of dumb,
less a consequence of thought than of their holder’s tribal identity. He
and his family ignored the rituals that punctuated most people’s
existence. He didn’t even celebrate his own birthday. What gave pleasure
and solace and a sense of belonging to others left Sam cold. When the
Bankman-Frieds traveled to Europe, Sam realized that he was just staring
at a lot of old buildings for no particular reason. “We did a few
trips,” he said. “I basically hated it.” To his unrelenting alienation
there was one exception: games. In sixth grade Sam heard about a game
called Magic: The Gathering. For the next four years it was the only
activity that consumed him faster than he could consume it.</p>
<p>Magic had been created in the early 1990s by a young mathematician
named Richard Garfield. It was the first of a new kind of game,
designed, perhaps, for a new kind of person. Garfield had started with
an odd question: Could a strategic game be designed that allowed the
players to come to it with different equipment? He wasn’t sure if it was
even possible. You couldn’t allow poker players to show up with their
own privately curated decks, or chess players to come equipped with
whichever pieces they wanted to. You didn’t want players to be able to
simply buy better material and thus victory.</p>
<p>In the game Garfield designed, players did indeed buy their own
playing cards, and assembled their own decks for competition. Each of
the cards had a picture of some mythical character—a witch, a demon, and
so on—and each character had its own special traits and a quantified
ability to inflict and withstand damage. (If Magic sounds similar to
Storybook Brawl, it’s because Storybook Brawl was one of many games
modeled on Magic.) But you couldn’t just buy the best cards—because you
never knew which cards would be the best. The game itself was unstable.
The cards constantly changed in ways that were impossible to anticipate:
new cards were introduced, and old cards were banned. The interactions
between the cards were too complicated to fully understand—at some point
Garfield realized even he could not predict what might happen in his own
game, which he liked. “The game is shallow if you know when you create
it what the best play is,” he said. “There should exist within the game
a scenario where it is impossible to determine a winning strategy.”</p>
<p>This was a radical notion: the game was ultimately unknowable. Merely
playing a lot and memorizing the best moves only got you so far, as from
one game to the next the best moves would change. “It makes it so
players have to constantly adapt the strategy to things no one could
have anticipated,” said Garfield. The people who were good at Magic were
those who found it easy to adapt their strategies. As the best strategy
was not just hard to know but unknowable, the people who were good at
Magic were also comfortable making decisions while being certain that
they were uncertain.</p>
<p>Sam was good at Magic. Inside the game he interacted more easily with
other people than he could outside it. Playing the game, he made his one
meaningful childhood friend, a boy named Matt Nass.fn2 Matt was as chill
as a twelve-year-old boy could be. He had none of the neediness of other
kids. “Given the backdrop of I don’t understand kids in the first place,
neediness was a problem,” said Sam. Matt made zero social or emotional
demands on him. He didn’t need Sam to generate facial expressions, or to
ask him questions about himself, or really to do anything but play
Magic.</p>
<p>Matt’s sheer lack of needs opened Sam up as much as Sam ever opened
up. Sam and Matt bought their cards together, and got driven together by
their parents to play local tournaments against grown men.fn3 Eventually
they went on the junior circuit together—reaching, at the end of tenth
grade, the national championships in Chicago. Matt saw Sam as maybe no
one else did. “I think it’s easy to think of people who are extremely
rational as robotic,” he said, “but I really don’t think that applies to
Sam. He was a really rare combination of hyper-rational and extremely
kind.” They drifted apart in high school but attended colleges an hour’s
drive from each other. In the fall of Sam’s junior year, he knocked on
Matt’s dorm room door. “I was playing video games and too distracted to
check my phone, so I had no idea what had happened,” recalled Matt. That
afternoon, Matt’s father, with whom he was very close, had died of a
heart attack. “Sam told me the news in person and then drove me back to
his nerd frat at MIT, where we played board games and video games all
night to distract me before I flew back home the next day.”</p>
<p>Every life is defined not just by what happens in it but by what
doesn’t. The beginning of Sam’s life is as striking for what didn’t
happen in it as for what did. He could see he was different from most
other kids. He made no effort to join their games, and they didn’t
understand his. He maintained what he later called a “romantically
positive” view of himself. “I didn’t think it was a happy thing that I
was different,” he said. “I thought it was a cool thing.” His only
weapon for defending himself against the derision of his schoolmates was
a shallow contempt, and a weak sense of his own superiority. “But I
never had a super principled reason for it. It was, I better think that,
or what do I have going for me?” He was perfectly positioned,
emotionally and intellectually, to make a religion of himself. What were
the odds of a mathematically gifted kid in the middle of Silicon Valley
in the early 2000s not picking up The Fountainhead and finding his inner
life inside? But that never happened.</p>
<p>Sam saw some merits in a certain kind of libertarianism. But he
listened to actual libertarians argue why, for instance, they shouldn’t
need to pay taxes. And he thought, Yeah, of course no one likes to pay
taxes, but that’s not exactly a philosophy. “They blurred the line
between libertarianism as a philosophy and selfishness as a philosophy,”
he said. His internal wiring didn’t carry this particular signal. “The
notion that other people don’t matter as much as I do felt like a
stretch,” he said. “I thought it would be bizarre even to think about.”
It was one thing to feel isolated; it was another to believe that one’s
place of isolation was the center of the universe. Or that you and what
happened to you were the only things that mattered. “It felt unambitious
to not care about what happened to the rest of the world,” said Sam. “It
was shooting too low to only think about what was going to impact
me.”</p>
<p>In their day jobs, his parents continually wrestled with the tension,
in American law, between individual freedoms and the collective good.
Both identified, broadly speaking, as utilitarians: any law should seek
not to maximize some abstract notion of freedom but rather the greatest
good for the greatest number. They never pushed their views on Sam, but
Sam of course heard them. And his parents mostly made sense to him.
Around the time he stopped reading books, he turned to utilitarian
message boards on the internet. He might not have felt connections to
individual people, but that only made it easier for him to consider the
interests of humanity as a whole. “Not being super close to that many
particular people made it more natural to care not about anyone in
particular but about everyone,” he said. “The default wiring I had was,
‘Yeah, there’s not anyone who doesn’t matter. So I guess I should care
the same amount about everyone.’” One day, at the age of twelve, he had
popped out of his room and made an impassioned point in defense of
utilitarianism. “I was just stunned when I realized that’s what he was
doing in his bedroom,” said Barbara. As Sam would later explain:</p>
<p>When I was about 12 years old I was first becoming politically aware
and started to think through social issues. Gay marriage was a no
brainer—you don’t have to be a hardcore utilitarian to see that making
people’s lives miserable because they’re completely harmlessly a little
bit different than you is stupid. But abortion was nagging me a bit. I
was pretty conflicted for a while: having unwanted kids is bad, but so
was murder.</p>
<p>Then Sam framed abortion as a utilitarian might. Not by dwelling on
the rights of the mother or the rights of the unborn child but by
evaluating the utility of either course of action.</p>
<p>There are lots of good reasons why murder is usually a really bad
thing: you cause distress to the friends and family of the murdered, you
cause society to lose a potentially valuable member in which it has
already invested a lot of food and education and resources, and you take
away the life of a person who had already invested a lot into it. But
none of those apply to abortion. In fact, if you think about the actual
consequences of an abortion, except for the distress caused to the
parents (which they’re in the best position to evaluate), there are few
differences from if the fetus had never been conceived in the first
place. In other words, to a utilitarian abortion looks a lot like birth
control. In the end murder is just a word and what’s important isn’t
whether you try to apply the word to a situation but the facts of the
situation that caused you to describe it as murder in the first place.
And in the case of abortion few of the things that make murder so bad
apply.fn4</p>
<p>This was how Sam figured out who he was: by thinking about things for
himself, without a whole lot of concern for the thoughts of others.
There were two brief periods, however, when he had someone around to
think about things with. Playing Magic with Matt Nass was one; math camp
was the other. After his freshman year in high school, he went to a
summer camp for mathematically gifted kids, on the Colby College campus.
(Joe drove him there and got lost—then saw an awkward-looking kid
sitting under a tree, fiddling with a Rubik’s Cube. “That’s when I knew
we’d found the place,” said Joe.) For Sam, math camp was a revelation:
here were kids with whom he had something in common. At math camp people
didn’t seem to care about his lack of facial expressions. At math camp
he had conversations with other people that resembled the conversations
he’d been having with himself. When other kids spoke about politics, it
wasn’t to express some dumb opinion. It was to figure out the best way
to model elections and predict their outcomes. When they discussed their
lives and how they might live them, they actually made sense to him.
Math camp kids could think their way to a belief. “And if you can’t
think your way to a belief, how can you think your way to an action?”
asked Sam.</p>
<p>At math camp Sam found people drawn to the flavor of utilitarianism
that appealed to him. “For the first time I wasn’t one of the smartest,”
said Sam. “Each of the campers was more interesting than the most
interesting person in high school. They were smarter in every way. They
were also more quantitative. But they had more distance from standard
culture and felt less pressure or less ability to conform.”</p>
<p>At the center of math camp social life was not math but puzzles and
games. Sam knew he loved games; after math camp he loved puzzles, too.
When he got home he decided to create his own puzzles, for others to
solve. Math camp had alerted him to the existence of people not entirely
different from himself. He used these puzzles to seek them out. He’d put
out an APB on every nerd site on the internet. Some weekends, one
hundred socially awkward humans of every age from all over the Bay Area
would turn up on the Stanford campus to find Sam waiting with a puzzle.
Solving the first puzzle led them to some other place on campus, where,
if they ever reached it, they’d find another puzzle, also created by
Sam. Solving that puzzle would lead them to yet another place on campus,
and yet another puzzle, and so on. On and on this went, for hours, until
some genius arrived at, in essence, Sam’s horcrux. Sam’s puzzle hunts
were seriously complicated. But he also created some simpler puzzles and
put them online. Like this one:</p>
<p>Sam’s biggest puzzle remained himself. Before math camp, he’d told
himself that he was smarter than other people. Math camp disproved that
theory. “This feels like the place for me more than anyplace I’ve ever
been,” he said. “But I’m below average. I didn’t think there was
anything about me that made me special, and it bothered me. Nothing I
did—no pieces of knowledge I had—set me apart at math camp.” By math
camp standards he was only mediocre at puzzles and games. But he also
suspected that the sorts of games they played at math camp were too
regular for his mind. “The place I am strongest is the place where you
have to do things other people would find shocking,” he said. He still
had no idea where in the world, if anywhere, he might find such a place.
Or if it existed.</p>
