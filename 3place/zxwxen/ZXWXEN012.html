<h4 id="manfred">10 Manfred</h4>
<p>Once everyone who felt the need to run had fled, the Albany resort
reminded me of New Orleans a week after Hurricane Katrina. No people,
but lots of stuff, and a surface quiet that masked the deeper chaos. You
could wander into any one of a dozen luxury condos and find not just
shelter but food and clothing, too. The most glorious five-bedroom units
in Honeycomb or Cube were yours for the taking, and stocked with
mountains of Chinese snacks, dress for any occasion, and enough alcohol
to sink a pirate ship. Sam’s parents had flown to the Bahamas and would
remain in the Orchid penthouse with their son till the end, as would his
psychiatrist. A single FTX technologist named Dan Chapsky had stayed on,
but he was an odd case. He’d held the title Chief Data Scientist, but
Sam barely knew who he was, or what he did, or why he had stayed—and
neither did he. On bankruptcy Friday, he had emerged from his own luxury
condo with the haunted look of a man after an air raid and sought out
George Lerner.</p>
<p>“Why am I here?” he’d asked.</p>
<p>George had looked him in the eye for a long moment and said, “You
need to leave.”</p>
<p>For whatever reason, Dan hadn’t left. He’d soon be employed by both
the US and the Bahamas bankruptcy teams and, right after that, be caught
up in the war between them for control of the company’s remaining
assets. Both needed someone to help them figure out the contents of
FTX’s database. Dan was the only one left who knew how to use a
computer.</p>
<p>At the peak, Albany had housed as many as seventy employees and
guests of FTX and Alameda Research. By Monday, November 14, the only
other sign of FTX life inside the walls of the Albany resort came from a
house directly behind Sam’s place in Orchid. The Conch Shack, it was
called. The Conch Shack was Ryan Salame’s finest purchase: a drop-dead
gorgeous six-bedroom house that, unusually for Albany, was in proportion
to its surroundings. Ryan had paid 5 million for it and assumed that Sam
would live in it. Sam had taken one look at it, seen that some of its
bedrooms were bigger than the others, and decided he’d instead take the
Orchid penthouse, where he and the other effective altruists could live
in virtually identical conditions.</p>
<p>The Conch Shack had been handed to Constance Wang, the
longest-tenured FTX employee in the Bahamas outside of Sam’s inner
circle of effective altruists. Hired on April 1, 2019, she’d been FTX’s
first Chinese and eighth overall employee. At the moment of the collapse
of the exchange she still had the title chief operating officer, and
added to it was CEO of FTX Digital Markets. Even after all her
colleagues had taken flight, Constance remained at the Conch Shack with
her two cats. The cats were a sticking point. Lucky and Money, they were
called. It would take Constance a couple of weeks to obtain the permit
to fly them back to China, and even then the airlines would only allow
her to return home with a single cat. If she’d been forced to choose,
she’d have picked Lucky, but the thought of leaving Money behind was
unbearable, and Constance was relieved not to have to think it. Her good
friend Quinn Li had stuck around to help. Along with Natalie Tien and
Zane Tackett, Quinn was one of the forty-eight people below Constance on
George’s org chart. “She stayed because of me,” said Constance. “I need
her help to bring my cats home.”</p>
<p>It wouldn’t have been the first time I’d seen people risk it all for
a pet. That had happened during Hurricane Katrina too. But Lucky and
Money were obviously not the only reason that Constance had stuck
around, as she’d remain long after she’d obtained their travel
documents. Sam still held out hope that he might resuscitate the
exchange. That hope rested on a Chinese-born crypto billionaire named
Justin Sun, who’d come to Sam with a plan. Sun, founder of Tron, a
blockchain, wanted to hand out his own private cryptocurrency, Tronix,
to FTX creditors, in exchange for their claim on the remaining assets.
Seeing that he needed someone who spoke Mandarin, Sam had begged
Constance to stay. “I want to make sure Sam doesn’t kill himself,” said
Constance, who didn’t think much of Justin Sun’s plan. “Though sometimes
I feel that is not my responsibility.”</p>
<p>More than anything, though, Constance wanted to understand what had
just happened. That was the most important reason the chief operating
officer of FTX had stayed in the Bahamas and risked detention or arrest:
she couldn’t stand not knowing how FTX had operated. “I like to figure
things out,” she said. “If I can’t figure things out, it really bothers
me.”</p>
<p>On that Monday morning after the collapse, I found the two young
Chinese women in the Conch Shack kitchen. Constance had already gotten
her hands on a small stack of what amounted to classified documents from
FTX and Alameda Research. Quinn had just returned from a failed attempt
to retrieve fresh vegetables from the houses and apartments around the
island previously occupied by FTX employees. (The places were already
locked and guarded.) Both were dealing with parents back in China
freaking out that their children were refusing to come home until they’d
finished their investigation. The entire situation had been inflamed by
the media; even in China, all anyone was talking about was Sam and FTX.
“FTX got so famous,” said Constance. “This is literally what FTX was
trying to achieve. We achieved it by going bankrupt!”</p>
<p>Both women had used various tricks to get their parents to leave them
be. Quinn argued to her mother that Sam’s parents were now in the
Bahamas with no one to console them. “I said to my mom, ‘They are two
old people, and they have no one with them,’” said Quinn. “My mom says,
‘I’m old people too!’” Constance was able to silence her mother only by
telling her that if she kept calling and hollering at her and did not
allow her the space to find closure in this chapter of her life, her
sadness might spin out of control into emotions she’d be unable to
survive. Amazed by the success of Constance’s strategy, Quinn had tried
it on her own mother. “I said to my mom, ‘I’m really sad. Do you want to
make me more sad? If you say one more thing, I’m going to kill myself.’
And it didn’t work! She said, ‘I have given you enough pity! You are
working all the time and you still have no boyfriend!’”</p>
<p>Constance took the lead in their investigation, using Quinn mainly as
a sounding board. As she was the more perplexed, she was also the more
motivated. She’d met Sam before he’d started FTX, when he was still just
another crypto trader no one in Asia had ever heard of. Back in late
2018, she’d been working in Huobi’s Singapore office when the exchange
had either frozen or misplaced some of Alameda Research’s money. “They
don’t speak Chinese, and customer support does not speak English,” said
Constance. “They found me, and they found their magic fix to their
problem.”</p>
<p>After Sam decided to open his own crypto exchange, he’d hired
Constance away from Huobi. She became the person he took with him to any
meetings in which Mandarin might be spoken. “He was literally nobody,
and nobody was taking him seriously,” said Constance. In those first
meetings, Sam’s leg would bounce up and down so violently that the table
where they sat would bounce too, and Constance would feel the need to
reach over and put her hand on his knee, to still him. He’d just look at
her and nod, but his leg would relax. Often he’d leave her feeling
uneasy about how much he’d disclosed, and to perfect strangers. “There
are some times I told him in the early days, You don’t have to be so
honest. In crypto everyone bluffs. Sam is always, Let me show you my
last card.”</p>
<p>Back then, crypto was still a small world. “You go to a few
conferences, you host an event, and you know everyone, basically,” said
Constance. So that people might get to know Sam, she’d taken him to a
dance party (“Sam has one move, bouncing straight up and down”) and kept
him there until three in the morning. They had a meeting scheduled at
nine. Constance awakened at six, hungover, and texted Sam to postpone.
He replied immediately. “He never sleeps,” she said. “I asked him once
how he can be happy, and he said, ‘Happiness does not matter.’”</p>
<p>Four years later, in the kitchen of the Conch Shack, she paged
through the private documents she’d unearthed (how I never learned) that
described some of what Sam had done with his surplus waking hours. The
first was an internal spreadsheet of FTX’s spending on endorsements. On
George’s org chart, Constance oversaw all of FTX marketing. Until then,
she’d never seen FTX’s biggest marketing expenditures. The numbers
boggled her mind. Three-year deals each with the Coachella music
festival, Steph Curry, and Mercedes’s Formula 1 team for, respectively,
5 million, 1.5 million, and 9 million. The five-year deal with Major
League Baseball for 62.5 million. A seven-year deal with the video game
developer Riot Games for 05 million. (“Just because Sam likes League of
Legends,” said Constance.) On it went, for a very long time, until it
reached the smaller deals, which actually didn’t look so small: 5.7
million to Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary, for example, for “twenty service
hours, twenty social posts, one virtual lunch and fifty autographs.”</p>
<p>Virtual lunch! Constance of course knew that Sam had been loose with
money. She’d just assumed that he had so much it didn’t matter what he
handed Kevin O’Leary. “I tried to question it,” she said. “But I thought
they were using the profit from Alameda. Or that Sam’s investments were
making a ton of money.”</p>
<p>The next document in her stack was a rough balance sheet of Alameda
Research that differed in important ways from the rough balance sheet
that had inspired the CoinDesk article now being credited with bringing
down the entire business. It appeared to Constance that it had been
hastily concocted either by Sam or Caroline, or maybe by both. Constance
had first come across it the previous Tuesday, after FTX had ceased
sending money back to its customers. “When I saw it, I told my team not
to respond to external parties because I did not want them to lose their
good name and reputation,” she said. The list of assets included the
details of hundreds of private investments Sam had made over the
previous two years, apparently totaling ,717,030,200. The liabilities
now had a line item more important than everything else combined:
0,152,068,800 of customer deposits. More than 0 billion that was meant
to be custodied by FTX somehow had ended up inside Sam’s private trading
fund. The document listed only billion in liquid assets—that is, US
dollars or crypto that could be sold immediately for dollars. “I was
like, Holy shit,” she said. “The question is: Why?” It was the same
question Zane had asked. “We had so profitable a business,” said
Constance. “Our profit margin was forty to fifty percent. We made four
hundred million dollars last year.”</p>
<p>These first two documents in Constance’s private haul helped her to
see how the money had been spent. The others revealed who, ultimately,
had picked up the tab. She now turned the page to a list of FTX’s top
fifty creditors: the fifty biggest accounts whose owners had been unable
to remove their money from the crypto exchange, ranked by the size of
their losses. At the moment of its collapse, FTX had had more than ten
million account holders, to whom it owed .7 billion. Nearly half of
those losses, or billion, were concentrated in these fifty accounts. The
biggest losers not employed by either FTX or Alameda were high-frequency
trading firms. Near the top was Jump Trading (06,160,600.00), and at the
bottom was Virtu Financial Singapore (0,095,336.83). The real names of
about half the list were concealed. The entity listed as Tai Mo Shan
Limited—and out more than 5 million—was actually another affiliate of
Jump Trading. Many of the disguised accounts belonged to FTX employees.
Constance herself had lost around 5 million. She still had 0,000 in an
ordinary bank account she’d kept from her previous life, but otherwise
she’d lost everything.</p>
<p>As she had also overseen the sales team, she knew most of the names
on the list, especially the high-frequency traders. She knew that every
one of them had been intensely suspicious about the relationship between
FTX and Alameda Research. “Everyone cared about it,” said Constance. “It
was literally the first thing I was asked every day. Is Alameda Research
front-running us? Does Alameda Research get to see other people’s
trades? Does Alameda get less latency?” In other words: Did Alameda
enjoy the same unfair trading edge on FTX that the high-frequency
traders enjoyed on Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange? Oddly enough,
it had not. Instead, FTX had simply loaned Alameda all of the
high-frequency traders’ deposits … for free!</p>
<p>FTX had also done other things to jeopardize the high-frequency
traders’ money, along with everyone else’s. It had exempted Alameda from
the risk rules that governed all the other traders. The trades made by
every other trader on FTX were liquidated the moment their losses
exceeded the collateral they had posted. That’s why FTX felt so much
safer than the other crypto exchanges. No single trader was allowed to
lose so much money that it put the exchange, and everyone who traded on
it, at risk. For Alameda Research, however, an exception had been made.
Sam’s private trading firm was allowed to lose, in effect, infinity
dollars before its trades were liquidated. “No one ever asked about
liquidation,” said Constance. “And no one ever asked, ‘Is our money
actually inside Alameda?’” Sam was right: People don’t see what they
aren’t looking for.fn1</p>
<p>Till this point, Constance had been calm and detached. It was as if
she were inspecting the medical charts of a total stranger to determine
the cause of death. When she arrived at the final document, her tone
changed. She’d uncovered a complete list of FTX’s shareholders, along
with the number of shares owned by each. At the end of each year, as
part of her bonus, she, like other FTX employees, had been allowed to
buy a certain number of shares in FTX. Everyone agreed that these shares
were the finest possible investment. Right up to the very end, the
world’s most famous venture capitalists had been clamoring to buy them,
at a higher price than employees were asked to pay. “Sam decides how
many each employee is allowed to buy,” said Constance. “Most everyone
maxed out.” She’d maxed out herself, but she’d never really known what
that meant. When she’d come upon this document, her eyes had naturally
searched for the number alongside her own name: 0.04 percent. Not 4
percent; not four-tenths of 1 percent: four one hundredths of 1 percent.
She’d of course known how many shares she’d been given, or had been
allowed to buy cheap, as part of her annual bonuses. She’d never thought
to calculate exactly how much of the company she owned, or how much
anyone else owned. She of course knew that Sam owned 60 percent and that
Gary and Nishad, the next biggest shareholders, had between them another
23 percent, because those numbers had been published. Forbes had needed
them to rank not just Sam but also Gary and Nishad on its list of
billionaires.</p>
<p>About all other FTX employees, including herself, Constance was in
the dark. Now she compared her number to the numbers of some of the
other people at the top of George’s org chart. Ramnik owned many times
more shares than she did, as did Brett Harrison, the former CEO of tiny
FTX US, who had only joined in May of 2021 (and resigned sixteen months
later). As did … basically everyone at her level. She thought back to
conversations she’d had over the past three years with potential
investors. Several had told her that they had seen FTX’s cap table—the
list of shareholders with meaningful stakes—and had been surprised that
her name was not on it. She hadn’t thought much about it. “I always
trusted Sam to treat me fairly,” she said.</p>
<p>That’s when Constance’s feeling about Sam changed: when she saw how
she’d actually been treated. Until then she’d been simply sad. On their
last day in jungle hut 27 the previous Thursday, she and Quinn had
fallen into each other’s arms and wept. They’d lost everything, but felt
bereft, not bitter. Not until Constance saw how little Sam had given her
compared to others did she see red. Enraged, she marched up to the
Orchid penthouse and confronted him. “‘It’s not possible,’ he said. ‘I
thought you had at least a million shares.’” She had less than a quarter
of that. “Sam said to me, ‘I never intended for that to happen to you,’
and I said to him, ‘It does not matter what you intended!’”</p>
<p>That revelation would set the tone for the next month. Constance
would stick around and make a show of helping Sam with his absurd plan
to resuscitate FTX. She’d meet with him nearly every day and tend to his
linguistic needs and even cook him dinner. What she was really doing was
trying to understand exactly what he’d done. Eventually the US
Department of Justice would find her, and she’d agree to serve as a
witness in the case they’d bring against Sam. But before that, she
intended to ask Sam a few questions. Get him to explain himself. See if
she could catch him out. Coax him into a confession. At the very least,
she might find the holes and the contradictions in his story.</p>
<p>The story Sam told Constance ran as follows. There had been two
different ways that money that should have been in cold storage inside
FTX instead wound up in Alameda’s hot little hands. The first was
through Alameda’s normal trading activity. Like every other trader,
Alameda had been allowed to borrow from the FTX exchange by posting
collateral. As collateral, Alameda had used, among other things, FTT—the
token that was, in effect, equity in FTX. The price of FTT had collapsed
with FTX. The collateral was now worthless, and some of the loans
remained unpaid. In Sam’s story, there was a reason that Alameda had
been exempted from the rules that governed every other trader on FTX,
and had liquidated their trades when the losses exceeded the value of
their collateral. Back in 2019, when FTX was created, Alameda was by far
its biggest trader. At the start, Alameda was on the other side of most
trades that occurred on FTX. It helped the market on the exchange to
work better if Alameda could occasionally run losses—for example, if
they needed to step in and acquire another trader’s losing positions
after FTX liquidated them.</p>
<p>In Sam’s telling, FTX had switched off Alameda’s risk limits to make
itself more appealing. The losses caused by this unsettling policy were
in any case trivial. Ordinary trading loans made by FTX to Alameda
constituted a small fraction of the losses to customers; on their own,
they wouldn’t have posed a problem. The bulk of the customers’ money
inside of Alameda that should have been inside FTX—.8 billion of it, to
be exact—resided in an account that Alameda had labeled fiat@.</p>
<p>The fiat@ account had been set up in 2019 to receive the dollars and
other fiat currencies sent by FTX’s new customers. Alameda Research had
created the account only after FTX had been unable to get its own bank
accounts. Back in 2019, no real bank in the United States had been
willing to offer its services to a new international crypto exchange.
The crypto entities that they did bank, like Alameda Research, usually
disguised their association with crypto. The biggest US crypto exchange,
Coinbase, had by some miracle persuaded Silicon Valley Bank to give it
an account—and thus a mechanism for Coinbase to receive US dollars from,
and send US dollars to, its crypto trading customers. A US bank account
had thereby given Coinbase a big advantage, but how exactly they’d
obtained the account was a story for another day; the story for this day
is how FTX failed to find its own US bank for sending and receiving
dollars. From its founding in the spring of 2019 until July 2021, when
it finally persuaded a bank in San Diego called Silvergate Capitalfn2 to
open an account in its name, FTX had no straightforward way to accept
dollar deposits.</p>
<p>In Sam’s telling, the dollars sent in by customers that had
accumulated inside of Alameda Research had simply never been moved.
Until July 2021, there was no other place to put them, as FTX had no US
dollar bank accounts. They’d been listed on a dashboard of FTX’s
customer deposits but remained inside Alameda’s bank accounts. Sam also
claimed that, right up until at least June 2022, this fact, which others
now found so shocking, hadn’t attracted his attention. He wasn’t
managing Alameda Research; Caroline was. Toward the end of 2021, when
the flow of new dollars into the fiat@ account trickled to nothing—as
customers could now deposit their dollars directly onto FTX, through a
US bank—Alameda Research had a net asset value of 00 billion. That
number was of course wildly unreliable, as it was simply the market
value of lots of cryptocurrencies for which the market might vanish, if
Alameda tried to sell into it. But even if you valued the contents of
Alameda more rigorously, as Sam sort of did in his head sometimes, you
could still easily get to 0 billion. The .8 billion that should not have
been inside Alameda Research was not exactly a rounding error. But it
was, possibly, not enough to worry about. As Sam put it: “I didn’t ask,
like, ‘How many dollars do we have?’ It felt to us that Alameda had
infinity dollars.”</p>
<p>That feeling would have changed by late spring of 2022. Between the
start of April and the middle of June, the price of a bitcoin fell from
just over 5,000 to under 9,000. Entering that summer, the relative
importance to Alameda of the .8 billion had skyrocketed. But Sam wasn’t
managing the risk inside Alameda Research, according to him. Caroline
was. Perhaps because he and Caroline were barely speaking by that point,
she hadn’t bothered to raise, directly with him, her worries about the
risks she’d been running.</p>
<p>Right up until October 2022, in Sam’s telling, he’d had only two
brushes with this huge unexplained pool of other people’s money that had
accumulated inside Alameda, and that Alameda was increasingly dependent
upon. The first was truly bizarre: in mid-June, Caroline had become
alarmed to discover that the fiat@ account had swelled from .8 billion
to 6 billion. She shared her worries not with Sam but with Nishad, who
in turn informed Sam and Gary—whereupon Gary discovered that it was just
a bug in the software. The real number in the fiat@ account hadn’t
changed: it was still .8 billion.</p>
<p>Three months later, in September, Caroline pulled Nishad aside and
told him that she was growing more and more worried about Alameda’s
market exposure. Nishad had taken Sam out onto the balcony of the Orchid
penthouse and relayed the message—but without explicitly mentioning the
fiat@ account. At that point, in Sam’s telling, Sam thought that Alameda
might be in trouble. He decided to dig into its accounts on his own and
understand the problem. By October, he had a clearer picture. It was
only then that he could see that Alameda had been operating as if the .8
billion in customer funds belonged to it. And by then it was too late to
do anything about it.</p>
<p>Constance heard Sam out. She listened to his story. But she refused
to believe it. She suspected that he was omitting some big, important
fact—say, a sudden trading loss inside Alameda Research that had caused
him to actively grab customers’ money and move it into Alameda. “It is
crazy,” she said. “He made me try to believe it was an accounting
error.” She didn’t know how or why he had consciously decided to take
customers’ money and use it as his own, but she felt sure he had. “I
always feel disappointed that Sam did not explicitly say he moved the
funds,” she said. She decided to find out what had happened on her own,
the way she had obtained the company’s internal documents. She poked and
prodded at Sam when his guard was down. She lurked over Dan Chapsky’s
shoulder as he searched FTX’s computer code for evidence that Sam was
not telling her the whole story. A month into it, she hadn’t found
anything.</p>
<p>Just once did she feel she might have tricked Sam into a confession.
She’d been talking to him about how to present his story to the public.
“I said to Sam, ‘You have to explain why you moved the funds.’ And he
never denied that.”</p>
<p>Yet he’d never actually said that he had moved the funds. His story,
implausible as it sounded, remained irritatingly difficult to disprove.
Constance’s own experience working for FTX didn’t help. It would not
have surprised her at the time, for instance, to learn that, to maintain
markets on the exchange, they’d needed to exempt Alameda’s traders from
FTX’s risk rules. She’d seen how critical Alameda’s willingness to trade
anything with anyone at any time had been to the successful launch of
FTX. She didn’t even think it fishy that a crypto exchange had its own
internal trading team. “Most of the exchanges did this,”fn3 she said.
“All the Chinese ones. It’s only a matter of how big the trading team is
and what they are doing.” She couldn’t even disprove Sam’s wild story
about the fiat@ account. Up until late 2021, when she had moved her own
dollars from her personal bank account onto FTX, she’d needed to wire it
not directly to FTX but to various accounts owned by Alameda Research.
Some of the dollars inside fiat@ had been hers.</p>
<p>For the better part of the month, I watched Constance return from her
encounters with Sam. “I try to poke, and each time I poke, he says a
little more, and more,” she said. Nothing he said, however, left her
feeling that her situation had been explained. One night in early
December, she stood with Quinn in her kitchen and considered what, if
anything, she had learned about Sam Bankman-Fried over the past month.
There’d been only one serious revelation, she’d decided. Over and over,
she’d confronted Sam with the suffering he had inflicted upon the very
people who had been most loyal to him. A very short list of characters,
topped by CZ and a few Western male former FTX executives, had exited
FTX better off than they’d been when they’d arrived. Most FTX employees
had lost their life savings. Some had lost their spouses, their homes,
their friends, and their good names. There were Taiwanese employees of
FTX still in Hong Kong who couldn’t afford plane tickets home. “I asked
Sam: ‘When you were doing this, have you ever thought how much this
event will be hurting people, and does that count as part of your
initial expected value calculation?’”</p>
<p>Even here, however, she found herself talking past Sam: in his
telling, he hadn’t realized how much risk he’d subjected others to,
without their permission. Constance nevertheless sensed that he didn’t
really register the damage he’d caused to other people in the way that,
say, she might have. “He has absolutely zero empathy,” she said. “That’s
what I learned that I didn’t know. He can’t feel anything.”</p>
<p>The morning after she said that, I returned to the Conch Shack
kitchen and found a handwritten note. “Why can’t Sam love?,” it read.
“By Quinn.”</p>
<p>I had a different question. It preoccupied me from the moment of the
collapse: Where had the money gone? It was not obvious what had happened
to it. And it would be hard to understand why the effective altruists
had done whatever they’d done with their customers’ money without
knowing how much of it they had lost and how they had lost it. In the
days after the collapse, I created what might have been the world’s
crudest financial statement. It treated FTX and Alameda Research as a
single entity: Sam’s World. One column listed all the money that had
entered Sam’s World since its inception, in April 2019; a second column
listed all the money that had exited Sam’s World. Both ignored the year
and a half of Alameda’s existence before the creation of FTX, as the
numbers involved were relatively small. All the numbers were obviously
very rough estimates. Some came from Sam, but all were confirmed by
former insiders who had no reason to lie to me. At any rate, when I was
done, my extremely naive money-in, money-out statement looked like
this:</p>
<p>MONEY IN:</p>
<p>Net customer deposits: 5 billion</p>
<p>Investments from venture capitalists: .3 billion</p>
<p>Alameda trading profits: .5 billion</p>
<p>FTX exchange revenues: billion</p>
<p>Net outstanding loans from crypto lenders (mainly Genesis and
BlockFi): .5 billion</p>
<p>Original sale of FTT: 5 million</p>
<p>Total: 3,335,000,000</p>
<p>MONEY OUT:</p>
<p>Returned to customers during the November run: billion</p>
<p>Amount paid out to CZ: .4 billion (Just the hard cash part of the
payment. I’m ignoring the 00 million worth of FTT Sam also paid him, as
Sam minted those for free. I’m also ignoring the 0 million worth of BNB
tokens that CZ had used to pay for his original stake, worth 00 million
at the time Sam returned them as part of his buyout of CZ’s
interest.)</p>
<p>Sam’s private investments: .4 billion (The whole portfolio was .7
billion, but at least one investment, valued at 00 million, Sam had paid
for with shares in FTX. He likely did the same with others, and so this
number is likely bigger than it actually was.)</p>
<p>Loans to Sam: billion (Used for political and EA donations. After his
lawyers explained to him that taking out loans was smarter than paying
himself a stock dividend, as he’d need to pay tax on the dividends.)</p>
<p>Loans to Nishad for same: 43 million</p>
<p>Endorsement deals: 00 million (This is likely generous too, as in
some cases—Tom Brady was one of them—FTX paid its endorsers with FTX
stock and not dollars.)</p>
<p>Buying and burning their exchange token, FTT: 00 million</p>
<p>Corporate expenses (salaries, lunch, Bahamas real estate):
billion</p>
<p>Total: 4,443,000,000</p>
<p>Obviously, this wasn’t the way Ernst andandandand Young would have
drawn it up—though these lists I made for myself didn’t look much
different than Sam and Caroline’s various attempts to summarize their
affairs. In the previous three and a half years, nearly billion more had
entered Sam’s World than had exited it. When FTX stopped returning funds
to customers, on Tuesday, November 8, it still had billion on hand. That
dropped the missing sum to billion. (The roughly 50 million stolen in
the hack three days later is irrelevant to this calculation.)</p>
<p>There were some likely explanations for the missing money. The more
you thought about them, however, the less persuasive they became. For
example, Alameda traders might have gambled away billion. But if they
had, why did they all believe themselves to be so profitable, right to
the end? I’d spoken to a bunch of them. Several were former Jane
Streeters. They weren’t stupid. They’d all been chirpy and upbeat and
even a bit boastful about how much more money Alameda made per trader
than Jane Street. Alameda may have lost a lot of money trading, but how
those losses occurred was not easy to see. The most hand-wavy story just
then being bandied about was that the collapse in crypto prices somehow
sucked all the money out of Sam’s World. And it was true that Sam’s
massive holdings of Solana and FTT—and other tokens of even more dubious
value—had crashed. They’d gone from being theoretically worth 00 billion
at the end of 2021 to being worth practically zero in November 2022. But
Sam had paid next to nothing for these tokens; they had always been more
like found money than an investment he’d forked over actual dollars to
acquire. He’d minted FTT himself, for free. For his entire haul of
Solana tokens, he’d paid no more than 00 million. His fleece cloud
fortune had evaporated, but that didn’t explain where all those hard
dollars had gone.</p>
<p>I found him alone that evening of November 14 in the Orchid
penthouse—the home to the polycule, as his club of effective altruists
was now being called in the New York Post. The outside world was just
then entertaining the most lurid fantasies about Sam’s inner circle.
Inevitably, word had got out that the effective altruists took a
principled stand against monogamy. After that, a rumor spread that they
spent half their time in the Orchid penthouse finding new ways to have
sex with each other. Mostly what they had done with each other was play
board games. In the heat of bughouse chess matches, they’d explored
every possible combination and position; otherwise, not so much. But the
confusion was understandable. They’d granted themselves hunting licenses
without ever really wanting to learn how to handle a gun. Who does
that?</p>
<p>In the weeks after the collapse, the Orchid penthouse never lost the
feeling of a smash-and-grab crime scene. Each bedroom remained as it had
been at the moment of its occupant’s departure. In them were preserved
not just possessions but states of mind. Caroline’s room was still the
giddy mess she’d left it when she’d gone on vacation with a new
boyfriend: the outfits she’d decided not to pack were still on her bed.
Nishad’s bedroom was perfectly clean. He had needed persuading to leave
the Bahamas, and had taken the time to leave his space feeling like a
hotel room waiting to be checked into.</p>
<p>Gary’s bedroom, into which Sam had moved, told its own, more
complicated story. Three packed bags remained in a corner: Gary had
somehow decided to pack, then left his bags behind. Yet he hadn’t packed
everything: his dirty clothes were still scattered all over his room. On
his desk remained a half-eaten package of oil-fried noodles. His
toothbrush was still on the bathroom counter. He appeared to have
prepared to leave, changed his mind, stayed for a few days and lived as
if he planned to stick around, then changed his mind again—whereupon he
cleared out as fast as he could. “It’s what people do when they’re
afraid,” said Sam, as I picked through the abandoned possessions. “It
tells you something about how and why people left. Like what if they
just took an extra hour and packed? He stayed for days. Why not stay for
days and one more hour? It’s not like he said, ‘I’ve got one hundred six
hours to be here,’ and then he got to one hundred six and had to run.”
He paused, then added. “I’m guessing his lawyers told him that he’d be
facing criminal charges if he stayed.”</p>
<p>The list of questions I showed up with whenever I met with Sam always
felt like one of those trick drinking glasses that refills itself after
you’ve taken a gulp. His answers always led to even more questions. What
happened to those six billion dollars? should have been at the top of my
current list. Constance’s documents had raised a lot of other, obviously
less important questions, however, and one of them I just had to get off
my chest.</p>
<p>“You paid Kevin O’Leary for virtual lunch?” I asked. “Seriously?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t that much,” said Sam, stretching out on Gary’s bed, which,
now that he no longer could afford the Albany maid service, remained
unmade. The Albany resort was making noises about shutting off the water
and the power, too. “It was like two million a year.”</p>
<p>“Five million a year, for three years,” I said. For some tweets and
autographs. From a Shark Tank person. And not even the most famous Shark
Tank person. Maybe not even the second-most famous Shark Tank
person.</p>
<p>“So,” said Sam. “There’s one type of product that’s like shampoo. The
way shampoo works is, you want shampoo, you buy shampoo. You don’t tweet
about shampoo. Financial products are different. Why do you trade on
Robinhood? Because your friends trade on Robinhood. It’s a conscious
decision.”</p>
<p>He’d entered the mode that maybe came most naturally to him. I
thought of it as Sam’s patiently-explaining-things-to-an-idiot mode.
He’d have made a great high school physics teacher.</p>
<p>“You agreed to pay fifteen million dollars to Kevin O’Leary,” I
said.</p>
<p>“How do you get people on FTX?” he continued, ignoring me. “Investing
is a social network. It makes no sense, but it is. And Kevin O’Leary is
a social influencer. And when you look at who has influence in this
social network, there aren’t that many people.”</p>
<p>With that, he began to list the people who might count as social
influencers in finance. Kevin O’Leary hadn’t even been at the top of
that list. Sam had tried and failed to hire Mad Money’s Jim Cramer.</p>
<p>“It’s Kevin O’Leary!” I was almost shouting.</p>
<p>“Who listens to him?” said Sam. He’d actually thought about Kevin
O’Leary, the way he’d thought about all the other endorsements. “The
answer isn’t no one. One million people follow him. And they follow him
for his financial advice. It’s shocking. But it’s true. Anything you can
do to grow out this exponential network helps. I can’t claim Kevin
O’Leary is who matters. But I don’t know who matters. How many people
who are expected to give financial advice have one million followers on
Twitter? There’s not some huge number of them. There’s thirty. Twenty
will say no to us for various reasons. He said yes. That’s reason number
one.”</p>
<p>“What’s reason number two?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Reason number two is he came to us.”</p>
<p>Eventually we arrived at the question whose answer might offer clues
to other puzzles: Where did the money go? It wasn’t the last time I’d
ask it. Like Constance, I’d poke and prod and always come away with the
sense that I’d learned less than I needed to know. But on that evening,
Sam filled in one piece of this particular puzzle: FTX had lost a lot of
money to hackers. To avoid encouraging other hackers, they’d kept their
losses quiet. The biggest hacks occurred in March and April 2021. A lone
trader had opened an account on FTX and cornered the market in two
thinly traded tokens, BitMax and MobileCoin. His purchases drove up the
prices of the two tokens wildly: the price of MobileCoin went from .50
to 4 in just a few weeks. This trader, who appeared to be operating from
Turkey, had done what he had done not out of some special love for
MobileCoin. He’d found a flaw in FTX’s risk management software. FTX
allowed traders to borrow bitcoin and other easily sellable crypto
against the value of their MobileCoin and BitMax holdings. The trader
had inflated the value of MobileCoin and BitMax so that he might borrow
actually valuable crypto against them from FTX. Once he had it he
vanished, leaving FTX with a collapsing pile of tokens and a loss of 00
million worth of crypto.</p>
<p>The size of those hacks was an exception, Sam said. All losses due to
theft combined had come to just a bit more than billion. In all cases,
Gary had quietly fixed the problem and they’d all moved on and allowed
the thieves to keep their loot. “People playing the game,” was Sam’s
description of them. (He really was easy to steal from.)</p>
<p>The hacks reduced to billion the number of unexplained missing
dollars. Sam was no help in reducing the number further. Either he
didn’t know where the money had gone or he didn’t want to say. He
dismissed the most obvious explanation: Alameda had suffered some big
trading loss in the great crypto crash of 2022. The collapse of FTX felt
a bit like the case of the missing Ripple, but on a far grander scale.
This time the question of where the money was would take longer to
answer, and the person most qualified to figure it out was soon
gone.</p>
<p>It was a Monday evening, December 12, and Constance and Quinn had
just finished watching a funny YouTube video about stinky tofu. They
were making their short nightly trek to Orchid to help with dinner when
they spotted, just ahead, the men in uniforms. It looked like an episode
of CSI, and they caught up to the guys on the sidewalk outside Sam’s
building to ask why they were there. The men wouldn’t say. Instead, they
said, You’re welcome to go up and find out for yourselves. Which isn’t
something that men in uniforms normally invite you to do. So they
did.</p>
<p>Moments earlier, a small crowd—Albany officials, CSI-looking people,
one very large Bahamian police officer—had stepped off the elevator and
into the penthouse. There was a long hallway from the elevator to the
living room. Coming down it, the big policeman asked, “Is Mister Sam
Bankman-Fried here?” He was reading from a paper in his hand—apparently
a warrant. When George stood up from his chair in the living room, the
policeman approached him and asked, “Are you Sam Bankman-Fried?”</p>
<p>At first no one could find Sam. As it turned out, he was tapping into
his phone in Gary’s bathroom. Less than an hour earlier, his lawyers had
called to say that the US government was giving him an hour to decide
whether to return to the United States or face arrest in the Bahamas.
He’d been rushing to send in his written testimony to the House
Financial Services Committee, which was about to hold an inquiry into
the collapse of FTX. Sam had hoped to cut a deal that would allow him to
appear in person without being detained by US authorities, but that
clearly was not going to happen. Before he’d hit Send, he’d landed in an
argument with his mother about what he planned to say. The opening of
his testimony included the sentence “I fucked up.” You cannot say “fuck”
to a US congressional committee, argued Barbara. That point now seemed
moot,fn4 as the Bahamian police officer had him in handcuffs before he
could finish what he was doing. Barbara stopped arguing with Sam about
what he could say to Congress, and started arguing with him about what
he should wear to jail. She wanted him to put on long pants. Sam
insisted on remaining in his cargo shorts.</p>
<p>As the police explained the charges and produced the warrant,
Constance and Quinn entered and tried to make themselves useful. To the
mess Gary had left behind, Sam had added his own sedimentary layer of
laundry. They searched through it for clothes Sam might want to take
with him to jail. He needs socks, thought Quinn, as the police officer
led Sam from the room. Because he likes to change his socks a lot. You
can’t take him away yet, because I have not finished picking up his
socks. George was now in the room too, looking for things Sam might
need. He came across a keepsake box. It surprised him. He hadn’t known
that Sam had the sentiment in him. He opened it. It had very little
inside. A few medals from high school math competitions. A copy of
Forbes magazine, with Sam’s face on the cover. And a box of business
cards, from his time at Jane Street Capital.</p>
<p>It was Manfred that caught Constance’s eye. Manfred was Sam’s stuffed
animal. He’d had it since birth and refused any substitutes, and so
Manfred was about to turn thirty-one years old. She’d first seen Manfred
in Hong Kong—Sam had brought it with him from Berkeley. Even then,
Manfred was so old and worn it was hard to determine his species. Might
have been a dog, could have been a bear. Manfred had made the journey
from Hong Kong to the Bahamas and, Constance assumed, might soon be
going to jail. Sam liked having Manfred around that much. Constance and
Quinn had gone back and forth on the meaning of Sam’s childhood friend.
Sam didn’t care about real animals. It had been an expected value
calculation, rather than emotion, that had led him to go vegan. Quinn
thought that Sam kept Manfred so close because “he doesn’t need to share
Manfred with anyone.” Constance saw Manfred in a different light. “I
think it is very, very important for him to have an emotional
attachment,” she said.</p>
