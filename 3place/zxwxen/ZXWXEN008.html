<h4 id="artificial-love">6 Artificial Love</h4>
<p>In late October 2008, someone calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto—and
who to this day, incredibly, has kept his identity a secret—published a
paper that introduced the idea of Bitcoin. It was mostly a technical
description of what would become the world’s first cryptocurrency. A
bitcoin was an “electronic coin”; it existed on a public ledger called a
“proof-of-work chain”; each time it was transferred from one person to
another, its authenticity was verified by programmers, who added the
transaction to the public ledger; those programmers, who would
eventually become known as bitcoin “miners,” were paid for their work by
being given new bitcoin; and so on.fn1 (Interestingly, the word
“blockchain” is nowhere in the paper.) How Bitcoin worked was
interesting chiefly to technologists; what it might do was interesting
to a much broader audience. It might allow ordinary people to exit the
existing financial system and never again rely on the integrity of their
fellow human financial beings. “What is needed is an electronic payment
system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,” wrote
Satoshi.</p>
<p>Trust, or the need for it, bothered Satoshi, whoever he was. His
paper doesn’t mention the 2008 global financial crisis, but his
invention was obviously a response to it. If Bitcoin had its way, banks
and governments would no longer control money. Bitcoin could be owned
and moved without the need for a bank. Its value could not be eroded by
governments. It didn’t require anyone to trust anyone or anything,
except, of course, the integrity and design of the computer code. It was
at once a plea for sound money and an appeal to mistrust. It was both
financial innovation and social protest. Crypto was like the friend
you’d made only because you shared an enemy. The sort of person drawn to
it, at least in the beginning, was the sort of person suspicious of big
banks and governments and other forms of institutional authority.</p>
<p>Zane Tackett was a good example of the type, though to call Zane a
type was to miss both the joy and the point of Zane. “The OG,” is how
others often referred to Zane. In April of 2013, with the price of
bitcoin hovering around 00, Zane, then a student at the University of
Colorado, had come across a strange magazine article. The writer
announced that he was going into hiding and offered a prize of 0,000 to
anyone who found him. The prize would be paid in bitcoin—which payment,
the writer explained, had the virtue of being irreversible and
untraceable.fn2 The article, oddly enough, caused Zane not to go looking
for the writer but to want to know what a bitcoin was. He’d recently
been ripped off, after he’d sold a Michael Jordan jersey card online and
the guy who’d bought it had reversed the credit card transaction and
kept the Michael Jordan jersey card. Zane was outraged that the
financial system had allowed that to happen. At the same time, he wasn’t
much enjoying college, and was perhaps more open than most to certain
people telling him what he should do with his life other than remain in
college. “My grandpa had said you should go to China and learn Chinese,
because they’re going to take over the world,” said Zane.</p>
<p>He’d taken the advice once and gone to China right out of high school
for a year, before returning to attend the University of Colorado. Now
he bought some bitcoin, dropped out of the University of Colorado, and
moved to Beijing, where he landed a job at a crypto exchange called
OKEx. He was the first non-Chinese person ever to work at the place.
Chinese companies were private empires. Their employees were treated
less as valuable assets than as vassals. “The employees can get screwed,
because if you get screwed, what are you going to do?” said Zane. “There
aren’t any protections.” His grandfather approved of his growing fluency
in Chinese, even as his parents grew increasingly concerned that he’d
gotten tangled up in something he shouldn’t have. And Zane continued to
acquire more bitcoin, and bitcoin continued to rise in price, and one
day Zane was rich. “I got funny money, and then I got quoted in the Wall
Street Journal and my parents decided I must be okay,” said Zane.</p>
<p>By 2016, bitcoin’s price had cracked 00, and Zane was not only
wealthy but sufficiently well respected to cut deals with crypto
exchanges to work from wherever in the world he wanted. Everyone in
crypto knew Zane, and everyone trusted him. He had a gunslinger’s name
and a gunslinger’s rail-thinness and now wandered, unattached to
anything or anyone, from place to place, the way gunslingers supposedly
wandered the Wild West. One month he might be in Indonesia; the next,
Argentina. Zane, like bitcoin, became placeless. As a matter of
principle, he lived his entire financial life in bitcoin. He was paid in
bitcoin and paid others only with bitcoin. He enjoyed affirming his
faith in the movement he had joined. “I did kind of want to take the
power of money away from government,” he said. Zane, like Bitcoin, had a
code.</p>
<p>By 2017 there had been a shift in the spirit of the movement he’d
joined. Bitcoin enthusiasts believed that Satoshi had created a
replacement for government-backed money, but government-backed money
wasn’t what Bitcoin most easily replaced. Gambling was. The mad rise in
bitcoin’s price in 2017 pulled in a generation of new speculators. It
wasn’t like the stock market: anyone in the world who knew how to use a
computer could trade crypto at any hour of any day of the week. The new
demand for speculative objects encouraged people to create hundreds of
new cryptocurrencies. Typically they were marketed to speculators as an
investment in some new enterprise, but seldom was the enterprise of any
real value. The initial sale of one new crypto coin, called EOS, raised
.4 billion dollars. Having nothing useful to do with the money, the
founders announced it would be used for “asset management.” The money
grab bothered Zane. “It was, ‘Hey, you’re telling me I can tell people
I’m going to build this project and they’ll give me money and I get to
keep the money even if I don’t build the project?’” he said. The money
grab likely would have perplexed Satoshi—as, very likely, would the very
idea of a crypto exchange. Bitcoin’s original selling point was that it
eliminated the need for financial intermediaries. It removed trust from
trades. You could trade your bitcoin directly and easily with other
people in a way that you couldn’t trade Swiss francs, or shares in
Apple, or live cattle. As it turned out, the people who set out to
eliminate financial intermediaries simply created some new ones of their
own, including, by early 2019, two hundred fifty-four crypto
exchanges.</p>
<p>These early crypto exchange founders weren’t typically financial
experts. They were a grab bag of technologists and libertarians and
idealists and high plains drifters, like Zane. Even more than, say, the
New York Stock Exchange, the institutions they created required their
customers to trust them. The New York Stock Exchange had regulators. If
the New York Stock Exchange stole all your money, its executives would
be sent to jail. In any case, the New York Stock Exchange would find it
hard to steal all your money, as you didn’t keep your money on the New
York Stock Exchange but in a brokerage account, managed by a bank,
overseen by other regulators. The new crypto exchanges had no
regulators. They acted as both exchange and custodian: they didn’t just
enable you to buy bitcoin but also housed the bitcoin you’d bought.</p>
<p>The whole thing was odd: these people joined together by their fear
of trust erected a parallel financial system that required more trust
from its users than did the traditional financial system. Outside the
law, and often hostile to it, they discovered many ways to run afoul of
it. Crypto exchanges routinely misplaced or lost their customers’ money.
Crypto exchanges routinely faked trading data to make it seem as though
far more trading had occurred on them than actually had. Crypto
exchanges fell prey to hackers, or to random rogue traders who gamed the
exchanges’ risk management.</p>
<p>Here was one example of the games that were played: Several of the
Asian exchanges offered a Bitcoin contract with one hundred times
leverage. Every now and then, some trader figured out that he could buy
00 million worth of bitcoin at the same time he sold short another 00
million worth of bitcoin—and put up only a million dollars for each
trade. Whatever happened to the price of bitcoin, one of his trades
would win and the other would lose. If bitcoin popped by 10 percent, the
rogue trader collected 0 million on his long position and
vanished—leaving the exchange to cover the 0 million he’d lost on his
short. But it wasn’t the exchange that covered the loss: the exchange
did not have the capital to cover the loss. The losses were socialized.
The customers—usually those on the winning end of the trade—paid for
them. And the losses could be huge. The Chinese-founded exchange Huobi
had one loss so big that it docked all traders on the profitable end of
trades nearly half their gains.</p>
<p>In traditional finance, founded on principles of trust, no one really
had to trust anyone. In crypto finance, founded on a principle of
mistrust, people trusted total strangers with vast sums of money. The
situation was less than ideal—and just how much less than ideal became
clear to Zane Tackett in August of 2016. That month, the exchange he was
then working for, Bitfinex, lost more than 0 million worth of bitcoin to
a pair of hackers working out of New York City. (By the time the couple
was arrested, the bitcoin was worth .6 billion.) Zane, then living in
Thailand, found himself responding to messages from the people whose
money Bitfinex had lost. “I got a lot of death threats and suicide notes
from it,” he said. “The death threats felt empty, but the suicide notes
did not. They were heartrending—I had put the money for my new house
with you and we will now be homeless.” He hated it. Because it was a
point of pride with him to be worthy of other crypto people’s trust.</p>
<p>After that, Zane found safer work with a new kind of crypto firm. The
firm specialized in over-the-counter trading—that is, privately buying
and selling large blocks of crypto to speculators who for various
reasons wished to avoid revealing their hand on public exchanges. The
guy who started the company had worked for Goldman Sachs and knew what
he was doing. For the next eighteen months, Zane made easy money in
markets with fat spreads between the bids and the offers, of a
percentage point or more. Toward the end of 2018 the markets suddenly
changed again. Spreads tightened dramatically, going from 1 percent to
seven one-hundredths of a percent. Some huge trader had entered the
market. Whoever he was, he more or less instantly established himself as
the official market maker of crypto. “It was pretty quick,” said Zane.
“And I was like, What the fuck just happened?” Zane’s trading firm sat
in the middle of the crypto markets and for the longest time had no idea
who this new player might be. “Then someone says, ‘It’s some vegan dude
who wants to give all the money to charity,’” said Zane. “Then someone
else says this same vegan dude had moved to Hong Kong and is starting
his own crypto exchange.”</p>
<p>Zane became curious. He found a copy of the white paper the vegan
dude had published, proposing a new kind of crypto exchange. It stunned
him. And to his surprise, he found himself badly wanting to work for the
vegan dude.</p>
<p>Sam later couldn’t remember exactly why he’d agreed to fly to Asia in
the first place. It wasn’t to see sights in which he had zero interest.
Flying frightened him so badly that, before takeoff, he had to medicate
himself and listen to soothing music. “Viscerally I’ve never believed
that a hunk of metal would fly,” he said. The stated purpose of his trip
was to attend a crypto conference in Macau, but once he’d arrived, he
discovered reasons to stay. For the first time since he’d entered the
market, he found himself in the same room with every major player in
crypto—many of whom were Asian. Also for the first time, he let people
outside his small circle of effective altruists know who he was, and
what he’d been up to; and it had some powerful effects.</p>
<p>Up to that moment, in late November 2018, Alameda Research had
operated in the shadows. They traded more than 5 percent of the total
volume of crypto markets and were still a secret. Jane Street had left
Sam with the view that there was no upside to publicity, and that the
best thing to do was to avoid it. He’d traded billions of dollars in
crypto but never in his own name, or in the name of Alameda Research
(whose name itself had been chosen in part to hide the fact that the
firm had anything to do with crypto). The Asian crypto exchanges had
grown so accustomed to their customers not wanting anyone to know who
they were that a few issued you a pseudonym when you started doing
business with them. One of the biggest exchanges at the time, BitMEX,
had bestowed fictitious names upon Alameda Research’s trading accounts,
each consisting of three seemingly randomly generated words.
Shell-Paper-Bird was one. Hot-Relic-Fancier was another—and so weirdly
funny that the Alameda traders had commissioned a painting of a Hot
Relic Fancier. On BitMEX’s leaderboard of the year’s most profitable
crypto traders, Shell-Paper-Bird and Hot-Relic-Fancier were both in the
top ten. No one had any idea that they were all the same trader, or who
that trader might be. That changed in Macau.</p>
<p>I’m Hot-Relic-Fancier, Sam would say, when he was introduced to
someone at the conference he thought might be important.</p>
<p>No, you’re not, was the typical reaction.</p>
<p>Even Sam knew that he wasn’t credible: a twenty-six-year-old white
guy with the hairdo of a lunatic, dressed in baggy shorts and a wrinkled
T-shirt. He needed to pull out his phone and open the trading account
and show them his money before these people believed him. Once he’d done
that a few times, a lot of people wanted to meet Sam. He had never been
big on face-to-face encounters, but he now had to concede that their
effects were astonishing. Weeks before he flew to Asia, one of the big
Chinese crypto exchanges had frozen Alameda’s account with a bunch of
money in it, for no obvious reason. Customer service hadn’t returned
their calls. After meeting Sam in person, the exchange’s bosses handed
him back his money. “All of a sudden I’m in a room with an important
person from every single crypto company,” said Sam. “My calendar is
filled with meetings every one of which is more interesting than the
most interesting meeting I’d have in the Bay Area.” More often than not,
the people he met hadn’t known what to make of him, or of Alameda
Research. “There was no one like us out there,” said Sam.</p>
<p>At that moment, Sam himself wasn’t quite sure what to make of the
crypto trading firm he’d created. His civil war with his fellow
effective altruists he now viewed as “the worst thing that has happened
to me in my life.” He’d pulled together a group of people he admired and
who shared his values, and he’d wound up a pariah to half of them, who
were still out there trashing him to their fellow effective altruists.
“It made me question myself,” he said. “It was the first time in my life
I was surrounded by people I respected who are saying that I’m wrong and
that I’m crazy. It made me question my sanity.” When he flew to Asia, he
was still writing and rewriting about the traumatic event. “I did damage
to the EA community,” he wrote. “I made people hate each other a little
more and trust each other a little less … and I severely curtailed my
own future ability to do good. I’m pretty sure my net impact on the
world has, so far, been negative and that is why.”</p>
<p>One of the curious things about Sam’s writing, given that much of it
was for his eyes only, was how evenhanded it was. He clearly felt sorry
for himself, but recognized that others might feel even sorrier for
themselves. He really didn’t like to blame himself for anything; he
didn’t particularly like to blame anyone else, either. “I’m a
utilitarian,” he wrote. “Fault is just a construct of human society. It
serves different purposes for different people. It can be a tool to
discourage bad actions; an attempt to recover pride in the face of
hardship, an outlet for rage, and many more things. I guess maybe the
most important definition—to me, at least—is how did everyone’s actions
reflect on the probability distribution of their future behavior?”</p>
<p>How did everyone’s actions reflect on the probability distribution of
their future behavior. The sentence told you a lot about how Sam viewed
other people, and maybe himself too. Not as fixed characters—good or
bad, honest or false, brave or cowardly—but as a probability
distribution around some mean. People were neither the worst nor the
best thing they’d ever done. “I deeply believe and act as if people are
probability distributions, not their means,” he wrote. “It’s pretty
important to me that others engage on that level as well.” His fellow
EAs’ behavior caused him to update his understanding of their
probability distributions in ways that left him less willing to hire
EAs. At the start he’d thought that hiring only effective altruists
created a special advantage—everyone in the company would trust each
other’s motives, and so no one would need to waste time and energy doing
the many things that people did to create trust among themselves. They
could skip the one-on-one meetings, and the eye contact and the firm
handshakes and, above all, the arguments about who deserved to be paid
how much, and why. As it turned out, they couldn’t.</p>
<p>After Tara and the others had left, Alameda returned to profitability
and remained there. It wasn’t making as much money as it had at the very
start, but it arrived at the end of 2018 with an annualized return of
more than 110 percent. Seeing the firm right itself, at least a few
effective altruists, including the remaining employees, wondered if Sam
had not known what he was doing all along. A few months after The
Schism, one former female employee sent Sam a message with a leading
question: Why do you think there’s been this theme of people thinking
you’re wrong about some EV [expected value] and you turning out to be
right but people not knowing/understanding that? Sam replied to her in
three separate brief messages.</p>
<p>Because people decided that Sam is evil and then refused to
acknowledge any evidence that contradicted it.</p>
<p>Because they were too emotionally invested in the belief, in decent
part because it was a way for them to avoid assigning any fault or blame
to themselves.</p>
<p>And also because it’s a big social statement to try to destroy
someone’s life and really embarrassing to take it back.</p>
<p>To put it another way: people misread him, decided that he couldn’t
be trusted, and then refused to change their minds about him. He needed
to do a better job of helping others to solve the puzzle. The facial
expressions he’d gone to so much trouble to master had been
insufficient: he needed to be more explicit.</p>
<p>Among the pages he wrote about the crisis were short documents
addressed to his employees, with titles like “Some Notes About Working
With Me” and “What it Means When Sam is Blocking You.” Woven through his
writings was advice to current and future employees about how to
understand him. “I spent a while during, middle, after and way after
trying to figure out what I should change about myself,” he said later.
“And that was a very frustrating experience. The thing that triggered me
was that people didn’t like my management and said I needed to learn
management technique.” He still didn’t think there existed any
management technique worth learning, just a lot of self-contradictory
nonsense about it. “It’s the blind leading the blind here,” he said.
“The only way is to teach yourself to see.”</p>
<p>In the end, he decided that there was just one change he needed to
make in himself: to become less off-putting to others. Even the people
of whom he most approved had complained that he needed to be “more
approachable,” and “offer more constructive advice,” and be “less
negative.” He was genuinely mystified by the criticism. He didn’t think
of himself as frightening. He didn’t intend to intimidate. But he wasn’t
going to change human nature, and so he decided that, going forward, he
would bury any negative reactions he had to anything anyone said or did.
He would give human beings with whom he interacted the impression that
he was far more interested in whatever they were saying or doing than he
actually was. He’d agree with them, even if he didn’t. Whatever idiocy
came from them, he’d reply with a Yuuuuuuppp! “It comes with a cost, but
it’s on balance worth it,” he said. “In most ways, people like you more
if you agree with them.” He went from being a person you’d be surprised
to learn approves of you to a person you’d be surprised to learn that,
actually no, he doesn’t.</p>
<p>Sam didn’t need to change himself as much as he needed to change his
business. By early 2019, there was a yawning gap between his self-given
goal to generate dollars to donate and the number of dollars that he was
able to generate as a crypto trader. In 2018, trading 0 million in
capital, Alameda Research had generated 0 million in profits. Their
effective altruist investors took half, leaving behind 5 million. Five
million of that was lost to payroll and severance for the departing
crowd; another million was lost to expenses. On the remaining million
they’d paid taxes, and so, after all was said and done, they’d donated
to effective altruist causes just .5 million. It wasn’t anything like
enough, in Sam’s view. “We needed to get a lot more capital, or way
cheaper capital, or make much higher returns,” he said. But at that
moment, with his reputation in EA circles in tatters, it was not obvious
where any new capital would come from. The crypto markets were becoming
more efficient every day. The big Wall Street high-frequency trading
firms like Tower Research Capital and Jump Trading and even Jane Street
were entering the markets and engaging in the same deforestation they
practiced in other financial markets. Even if Sam somehow found more
capital, there’d be less money to be made with it.</p>
<p>The idea of creating a crypto exchange was at once obvious and
implausible. Obvious because the crypto exchanges were money machines.
They were the casinos that sat in the middle of a world-historic
speculative frenzy and charged fees for every bet that was placed. The
founders of the world’s half-dozen or so biggest crypto exchanges were
all likely already billionaires, even though the exchanges themselves
routinely lost their customers’ money. Implausible because of who Sam
was, and how he related to people. He had no clue how to engage with
ordinary people in the way ordinary people needed engaging with, when
you ran an exchange. To create a successful exchange, you needed to
attract a crowd; you needed to relate to a mass audience. You needed
customers. And you only got them if they trusted you. And they only
trusted you if they knew who you were or thought they did. Sam wasn’t
sure his own colleagues knew who he was, which was why he was writing
memos to explain it.</p>
<p>Plus he’d already tried and failed to do it. Back in May 2018, in
Berkeley, Sam had asked Gary Wang to write the code for a bitcoin
exchange, and within a month Gary had done it. CryptonBTC, it was
called. They put it out on the web without any idea how to attract
attention to it. No one showed up to trade on it. It was as if it had
never happened. The code Gary had written for the first exchange had
been sweet, however. From the total nothingness that had been
CryptonBTC, Sam had learned that if he asked Gary to create a crypto
futures exchange, he could do it in a month, and it would be more
reliable and less risky for its users than any existing exchange. Gary
was a genius.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, Sam and his small team began to pitch the billionaire
founders of existing exchanges on the idea of paying Alameda Research
(Gary) to create a crypto exchange, different in important ways from any
that existed. Alameda would supply the technology; the existing
exchanges would supply the customers, and the trust. The most likely
buyer, and the person to whom Sam himself pitched the idea, was CZ.</p>
<p>CZ was Changpeng Zhao, CEO of the crypto exchange Binance. Born in
Jiangsu province, he was raised, from adolescence, in Canada, and
educated there, returning eventually to China, with Canadian
citizenship. He’d run through some ordinary jobs on the fringes of high
finance—including a stint as a developer at Bloomberg—before landing as
the chief technology officer at OKCoin. He’d left OKCoin in 2015 and
created Binance in 2017; two years later, he was being described in
industry publications as “the most powerful man in crypto.” It might not
have been true at the time, but it was about to become so. In mid-2019,
Binance was still just a spot crypto exchange—it did not trade crypto
futures or other derivatives—no bigger than a handful of others, and
handicapped by its inability to offer most of its customers the leverage
they longed for. (Everyone in crypto wanted to bet more than they had.)
Binance’s customers traded various cryptocurrencies but generally
weren’t borrowing money from the exchange to do it. CZ preferred it that
way. And he was a bit wary of what Sam was proposing: an exchange that
traded only crypto futures contracts.</p>
<p>A futures exchange was different in important ways from a spot
exchange. On a futures exchange, traders put up as collateral only a
fraction of the bets they made. On a trade that was losing money, the
exchange typically asked for more collateral at the end of the day. If a
trade went bad fast, it could wipe out the collateral and leave the
exchange on the hook for losses—whereupon the exchange turned to its
customers to cover the losses, as crypto exchanges had, historically.
The design that FTX (Gary) had come up with solved the problem, in an
elegant way. It monitored customers’ positions not by the day but by the
second. The instant any customer’s trade went into the red, it was
liquidated. This of course was unpleasant for the customers whose
positions went into the red. But it promised to do away with socialized
losses, which had plagued crypto exchanges from the beginning. An
exchange’s losses would never need to be socialized, because the
exchange would never have losses.</p>
<p>Sam had first met CZ not long after his move to Hong Kong at the end
of 2018. Binance was looking for crypto companies to pay 50,000 apiece
to sponsor its conference in early 2019 in Singapore, and Sam stepped in
with the money. CZ had rewarded him by appearing onstage with him, and
ever after, Sam was to say, “That’s what gave us legitimacy in crypto.”
He’d effectively paid CZ to be his friend. But even then Sam didn’t have
a good feel for CZ, except that they didn’t have much in common. Sam
lived in his head and thought his way to decisions, or at least believed
that he did. If CZ ever had an original thought he never expressed it,
and he seemed to feel his way to his decisions. Sam thought about the
size of the pie, while CZ cared more about the size of his piece. Sam
was gunning to build an exchange for big institutional crypto traders;
CZ was all about pitching to retail and the little guy. Sam hated
conflict and so was almost weirdly quick to forget grievances; CZ
thrived on conflict and nurtured the emotions that led to it. CZ had a
complex web of allies and enemies. In the pitch book he created to
launch Binance back in 2017, much of what he listed as his
qualifications for the task were social alliances with other crypto
insiders. (Zane Tackett among them. In a brief biography, CZ described
Zane, oddly, in relation to himself, saying that to Zane he played the
role of “mentor and good friend.”) Sam had no real social alliances at
all. In his interactions with CZ, had he not trotted out his learned
facial expressions, he would have spent a lot of time staring blankly
while CZ spoke. “CZ sort of just says things,” said Sam. “They aren’t
dumb. They aren’t smart. I didn’t have much of a sense of him until he
had to make decisions.”</p>
<p>The first decision CZ had to make was whether to pay Sam the 0
million he was asking for his cleverly designed futures exchange. After
thinking it over for a few weeks in March 2019, CZ decided no—and then
told his people to create a futures exchange on their own. Which struck
Sam as such an ordinary and vaguely disappointing thing to do. “He’s
kind of a douche but not worse than a douche,” said Sam. “He should be a
great character but he’s not.”</p>
<p>Only after CZ turned him down did Sam decide to create an exchange
himself. The idea was simple: the first crypto futures exchange that was
well enough designed that it would serve the needs not just of crypto
people but also of big professional traders, like Jane Street. Still,
Sam was deeply uneasy about it. “We were going to build a product that
is better than any product out there,” he said. “If it works it is worth
billions of dollars, but I thought there was a better than fifty percent
chance it wouldn’t work. I’d never done marketing. I’d never talked to
media. I’d never had customers. It was just different from anything that
I’d ever done.” And so he started grabbing people who might do the
things he didn’t know how to do. People unlike any he had ever worked
with, but who had strong ties with other crypto people. He grabbed Zane
Tackett, for instance, and with Zane came a great deal of crypto trust.
Even before he grabbed Zane Tackett he grabbed Ryan Salame.</p>
<p>If there was such a thing as the opposite of an effective altruist it
was Ryan. Ryan was a freedom-loving, tax-loathing Republican. He had
started his career as a tax accountant at Ernst andandandand Young and
been liberated from the misery and the tedium after the crypto trading
firm Circle hired him to do their books. It had taken Ryan about two
seconds to see that crypto trading was more fun than tax accounting.
When Sam found him, Ryan was working as a salesman on Circle’s trading
desk in Hong Kong and had become a walking advertisement for worldly
pleasure. Any guy in crypto who wanted what every guy in crypto wanted
found in Ryan an ally in the pursuit: Ryan was who you called if you
wanted to have fun.</p>
<p>Ryan was handsome; Ryan was also shrewd. When Alameda Research ramped
up its trading in Hong Kong and collapsed the spreads for everyone else,
Ryan was struck by just how much smarter it was than the rest of the
market. He had no idea who Sam Bankman-Fried was, but he noticed that CZ
seemed to want to keep him close—going so far as to allow Sam to set up
a booth for Alameda Research at Binance’s conference. Ryan also noticed
that Sam and his traders lacked the usual crypto social graces. “They
wouldn’t respond to you in chats,” said Ryan. “They wouldn’t react to
your jokes. It was not the experience you were used to in crypto. Sam
wasn’t part of the crowd. No one had seen him at anything.”</p>
<p>Eventually Ryan visited Sam in his new Hong Kong office. “You talk to
Sam for five minutes and you realize something’s different,” he said.
Sam’s disinterest in ordinary social interaction had spilled over into
his company even more dramatically than Ryan had imagined it might have.
“It was just a college dorm of nerds sitting at computer screens,” as he
put it. “They never left the office.” Ryan could see that Sam could use
him to establish social connections with crypto people, and to make them
feel comfortable with him—which at that moment they were not. “Sam
forgets how many people thought he was a scammer at first,” said Ryan.
“You’d expect to find a Sam behind any scam.”</p>
<p>Sam did have one thing going for him, socially, with other crypto
people. The higher crypto prices rose, the greater the flood into crypto
of sober-minded people in suits that people like Zane found
insufferable. Ryan might have counted as one such person, but Ryan was
not sober-minded, so he got a pass. The Goldman guys and the venture
capitalists and the corporate lawyers turned crypto bros—they were all
part of this invasion of conventional people who wanted to make fast
money without the kookiness that had made the fast money possible. The
pseuds would seek common ground with the original crypto religionists by
exhibiting their excitement about the technology. The blockchain! The
blockchain is going to change … everything, they’d say, and hope that
would suffice. A religion based on hating banks and government and any
sort of institutional authority—well, for the pseuds, that was usually
taking things too far.</p>
<p>The crypto religionists, the people who had been drawn to the cause
for their own reasons, had, at best, mixed feelings about the people who
came to it later, and just for the money. About Sam, Ryan thought, they
might be a bit more inclined to suspend judgment. Sam shared an
important trait with the crypto religionists: a dissatisfaction with the
world as he found it. He did not have any particular hostility toward
governments or banks. He just thought grown-ups were pointless.</p>
<p>Ryan was less a grown-up than the highest expression of a new
species, the crypto bro, that Sam sensed he needed on hand. He hired
Ryan without being totally sure what Ryan would do. “The job description
was sort of make it all better,” said Ryan.</p>
<p>To create a crypto exchange, Sam needed crypto people, but he also
needed money to pay the crypto people. The normal, old-fashioned way to
get it would be to go hat in hand to family and friends, or to raise the
money from venture capitalists. Sam didn’t have any friends with the
kind of money he needed, and he didn’t know any venture capitalists.
What he had was a token. It belonged to the same general family as the
thousands of other crypto coins that had been created since 2017 and
shilled to the public. The FTX token was called FTT.</p>
<p>The most important feature of FTT was that its holders were
collectively entitled to roughly a third of the annual revenues of the
FTX exchange. Of the billion in revenues the exchange generated in 2021,
for example, 33 million would be set aside to “buy back and burn” FTT.
FTX would remove tokens from circulation in the same way that a public
company bought back its shares, and thus raise the value of all
remaining shares. FTT was not merely like stock in FTX, it was stock in
FTX—and even came with voting rights on certain decisions made inside
the company. As it gave you a share of the gross, rather than the net,
it was arguably even more valuable than the stock. “The crypto people
would say, Why would I want your equity? I’d rather just buy the token,”
said Sam. “The venture capitalists would say, What’s a token?”</p>
<p>One hitch to the tokens was that they were illegal to sell inside the
United States. The explosion of new crypto tokens had spawned a new game
of cat and mouse, between token creators and securities regulators. The
world’s most aggressive securities regulator, the US Securities and
Exchange Commission, now devoted a meaningful amount of energy to
arguing that a lot of these tokens were securities (which they obviously
were), and so a threat to American investors, and banned from the US
unless they first won SEC approval (which seemed highly unlikely).
Crypto exchanges and token creators who wanted to sell to Americans
insisted that these tokens weren’t securities but more like, say,
Starbucks Rewards points. As FTX was incorporated in Antigua, operated
in Hong Kong, and in principle did not allow American investors to trade
on its crypto exchange, and in principle did not sell its tokens to
Americans, it was beyond the reach of the SEC.</p>
<p>At any rate, the buyers of the FTT would either be foreigners, or
Americans living outside the country. And now that was who Sam was
courting, in his own awkward way. Three weeks before he offered FTT to
the public, he flew to a conference in Taipei. All the big crypto
players turned up at a party thrown by one of the biggest exchanges. And
so, mechanically, did Sam. “Tonight was a night about booze and women
and lasers and loud booming music,” he wrote in his journal afterward,
“but there was an odd microclimate that seemed to follow me around as I
wandered between the tables. It didn’t start to crystallize until I
walked by CZ a few … times and each time he broke eye contact with his
eye candy and embraced me: people were thinking about us, a lot. This
was the first time CZ seemed more interested in me than I was in
him.”</p>
<p>Out of thin air FTX minted three hundred fifty million FTT tokens.
Sam offered a chunk of them to employees at five cents each, and another
chunk to important crypto people, like CZ, who might be friends of the
exchange, at ten cents. CZ initially declined, as did most of FTX’s own
employees—Ryan Salame was a big exception—but other outside investors
bought up enough that Sam eventually raised the price, first to twenty
cents and then to seventy. On July 29, 2019, FTT was listed on FTX and
thus offered to the general public. (“That was the most nervous I’d ever
seen Sam,” said Nishad.) It opened at and traded up to .50. Inside two
months, Ryan Salame had made thirty times his money, and the outside
buyers had made fifteen times their money. Of the original three hundred
fifty million tokens minted, FTX had sold roughly sixty million at about
a dollar less than they were now worth. Within a week or so, Sam’s
doubts about his ability to earn the trust of a mass audience had turned
to regret for selling FTT way too cheap. Just how cheap became clear
when, a few weeks later, CZ called Sam and offered to buy a 20 percent
stake in FTX for 0 million.</p>
<p>It was as if a wildcatter had accidentally built his house on an oil
field: Sam hadn’t even really wanted to run a crypto exchange. He’d
built a casino that offered gamblers the chance to make bets bigger than
their bank accounts justified, at seemingly no risk to the casino or to
the other gamblers, and it was exactly what the crypto world wanted. His
timing, though accidental, was perfect, as big professional traders like
Jane Street were entering the crypto markets and in need of a
professional-grade futures exchange. Sam’s choice of location, also
accidental, was perfect too: Hong Kong was maybe the only spot in the
world where he and CZ would both feel at ease. Hong Kong was like a
chessboard with a voice embedded in it to shout rule changes in the
middle of every game. The Hong Kong regulators gave a crypto exchange
cover to do pretty much whatever it wanted to do but changed the rules
often enough to keep it interesting.</p>
<p>On top of it all, Hong Kong, and Asia generally, teemed with
ambitious young people with no particular qualifications who thought
nothing of dropping whatever they’d been doing to go to work for a
crypto exchange run by a person who was all but unknowable. Sam needed
people just like that: right from the start, FTX should have hung a sign
on the door that said No Experience Necessary. Sam hired Natalie Tien,
who had little experience with media or marketing, and made her head of
corporate public relations, for instance. He hired a young saleswoman
from the Huobi exchange named Constance Wang and made her the company’s
chief operating officer. Faced with a necessity, Sam turned it into a
virtue. “It’s a moderately bad sign if you are having someone do the
same thing they’ve done before,” he said. “It’s adverse selection of a
weird sort. Because: why are they coming to you?”</p>
<p>The funny thing about Ramnik Arora was that all he’d really been
looking for was a chance to walk to work. He’d grown up in India,
completed a master’s in computer science at Stanford, done a stint at
Goldman Sachs, and was now married and settled in the East Bay. For
three years he’d had a miserable commute, from Berkeley to a job at
Facebook in Menlo Park. He’d started on a team working on real-time
auctions for online ads—with the goal of showing the perfect ad to the
perfect person at the perfect time—then moved to another team trying to
launch Libra, Facebook’s doomed bid to create its own
cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Somewhere between Goldman Sachs and Facebook, Ramnik had given up
looking for passion in his work. If he seemed older than he was, it was
because he was letting go of one of the things that defines youth: hope.
“The smartest minds of our generation are either buying or selling
stocks or predicting if you’ll click on an ad,” he said. “This is the
tragedy of our generation.” The effect of the tragedy had been to shrink
his ambition. He was thinking less and less about changing the world and
more and more about making himself and his wife comfortable within it.
“I’d read a study that there was a fifteen percent happiness gain if you
could walk to work,” he said.</p>
<p>And so it was with domestic happiness in mind that, in the late
spring of 2020, he’d plugged “crypto” and “Berkeley” into LinkedIn. He’d
received a single result: Alameda Research. He’d never heard of it. He
sent in his résumé. Within minutes he received a Zoom invitation from
Sam Bankman-Fried—who wanted to talk to him not about Alameda but about
a new crypto exchange that Alameda Research had launched, called FTX.
The numbers coming out of Sam’s mouth via Zoom shocked Ramnik, as did
Sam’s willingness to disclose them to a total stranger. FTX had existed
for just a bit more than a year. In the final six months of 2019, it had
generated about 0 million in revenues. In 2020, the number was going to
jump to somewhere between 0 million and 00 million.</p>
<p>At some point during the conversation, Ramnik figured out that Sam
was not in Berkeley but in Hong Kong, where it was three in the morning.
People behind Sam were scurrying back and forth with all the hustle and
bustle of people in the middle of their workday. Whatever Sam actually
said on that first call, Ramnik heard mainly a sound he’d nearly
forgotten. It was the sound of passion.</p>
<p>He took a job with FTX, at an 80 percent pay cut to what he’d been
making at Facebook (and at a 95 percent discount to what TikTok was
offering). Between Alameda and FTX, he was Sam’s fiftieth hire. His
title was Head of Product, which was weird, as Ramnik didn’t know
anything about the product. On the Zoom call, Sam had said that he
actually had no idea what Ramnik might do for FTX but that they’d figure
out something.</p>
<p>Once Ramnik moved to Hong Kong, his absence of a purpose became a
problem. FTX clearly didn’t need a Head of Product. There was no such
job. Gary had written all the code. A tiny force of young Chinese women
and crypto dudes were already out evangelizing the product, and they
didn’t need Ramnik’s help. Nishad was basically managing the developers,
who fixed any problems that arose with the product, and dealing with
anyone who was unhappy with their job or Sam’s management style.</p>
<p>For the first twenty-one days on the job, which he spent quarantined
inside a dreary Hong Kong hotel room, Ramnik wasn’t sure what he was
supposed to do. He fiddled some with the exchange’s computer code—the
product—but every time he did, he had to let Nishad know what he’d done.
He’d send Sam notes, but Sam would take two days to reply. Emerging from
his quarantine, Ramnik asked Nishad, “Am I a net positive for the
company or a net negative?” “Net negative,” replied Nishad. “The amount
of time I’m spending checking on your work is greater than the amount of
time it would take for me to do the work myself.” Ramnik actually
appreciated the honesty. And decided he’d need to find something else to
do.</p>
<p>Soon he found himself playing a role that had never existed either in
the company or in Sam’s life. “I quickly became the person Sam relied on
for random things,” said Ramnik. “The first thing he asked me to do was
find an auditor, because we didn’t have one.” As Sam didn’t care about
titles, Ramnik’s never changed. He was and would remain Head of Product,
when he more accurately could be described as Sam’s Handyman. “It was,
‘Lots of stuff comes up, and you’re going to handle what comes up,’”
said Ramnik. Oddly, much of what came up was, in one way or another,
about trust. As in: how could FTX get people to trust it?</p>
<p>Sam didn’t hire grown-ups, but now he had Ramnik, and Ramnik had some
grown-up-like traits. He hesitated before he spoke. He’d worked for
years at Goldman Sachs and Facebook. He’d just turned thirty-three and
could pass for thirty-five and his knee didn’t bounce up and down when
he spoke. He wore long pants. He had a wife and an almost Wemmick-like
view, not shared by Sam or anyone who had thus far managed to survive
Sam’s management style, that private life was one thing and the office
another. He had the ability to imagine what grown-ups might think if,
say, they found you in bed with the wrong person. It was Ramnik who
intervened when Sam went all in on the idea of FTX being the first to
list the token of a Taiwanese porn business called Swag. Swag would cut
them a big check in exchange for FTX creating a market for Swag tokens;
FTX would thus become the financial engine for a Taiwanese porn empire.
“I had to talk him out of that,” said Ramnik. “In talking him out of it,
I felt there was a fork in the road. There was no turning back. Sam was
hell-bent on doing this. And I’m like, No fucking way we’re doing
it.”</p>
<p>Inside of crypto world, none of Ramnik’s qualities made much of a
difference and indeed they might have been a disadvantage. Outside of
it, they were invaluable.</p>
<p>Ramnik noted that people didn’t identify with companies; they
identified with people. They might never trust this new crypto exchange,
but they might trust its founder, odd as he was, if they thought they
knew who he was. “The first thing we asked was can we get Sam on TV,”
said Ramnik. “That seemed like a long shot. But Natalie somehow did it.”
To help her in her new and unfamiliar role as head of FTX public
relations, Natalie had called a New York public relations firm called M
Group Strategic Communications. Its head, Jay Morakis, was at first
wary. “I thought maybe it was some shady Chinese thing,” he said. But
then he heard Sam’s pitch, and watched Sam’s first big public
appearance, on Bloomberg TV. “Whatever the closest thing in my PR
experience has been to this, nothing is close,” he said. “I’m fifty
years old. I’ve had my firm for twenty years and I’ve never seen
anything like it. All my guys want to meet Sam. I have CEOs calling me
and asking: Can you do for us what you did for Sam?” He’d had to
explain, back in 2021, that he actually hadn’t done anything. Sam had
just sort of … happened.</p>
<p>The effect of Sam’s media appearances in the latter part of 2021
exceeded everyone’s expectations. This person who had always kept the
world at a distance, and from whom the world had mostly kept its
distance, somehow, through media, came alive in people’s imaginations.
Inside of crypto Sam was becoming famous; outside of crypto he was still
unknown and, therefore, untrusted.</p>
<p>Part of Ramnik’s odd new job was to help fix that. “How do you
determine something is credible?” he said. “It’s by association. Trust
comes from preexisting relationships.” Sam had no preexisting
relationships; before about the age of eighteen he’d hardly had any
relationships at all; since then, he had come to know a bunch of
effective altruists (a lot of whom were furious with him for creating a
civil war inside their movement) and another bunch of Jane Street
traders (who were massively irritated with him for leaving Jane Street
to create a rival firm, and for poaching Jane Street traders).</p>
<p>And so, with Sam, Ramnik set out to create new relationships,
starting with some venture capitalists. FTX didn’t really need capital.
But if they could find the right venture capitalist to form a
relationship with Sam, it might help them ease their way into the minds
of others outside of crypto. “We had this conversation about legitimacy
and trust,” said Ramnik. “It was, ‘Can we raise money from a good VC?’
No Chinese VC was a big thing. We wanted to be associated with US
institutions.”</p>
<p>The first conversations between the crypto people and the venture
capital people were a bit awkward. “They wanted samples of what our
internal controls are,” said Ramnik. “We didn’t have any.” The venture
capitalists could see how fast FTX was growing—that they were
wildcatters sitting on a gusher—but were unsure if what they were seeing
was closer to the last gallon of oil than the first. Was it just a big
trade that would go away with the crypto craze, or was Sam building
something enduring? If the latter, he’d need access to American
investors, and for that FTX needed internal controls. They also needed
to be licensed and regulated.</p>
<p>Therein lay the biggest problem, in earning the trust of the VC:
there was no global license for a crypto futures exchange. Some
countries, like Hong Kong, offered a license for a spot crypto exchange
and agreed to turn a blind eye to futures trading. Most countries, like
the United States, offered no license at all. The United States
government wasn’t even sure which agency should regulate crypto—the
Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. The question of who regulates any given crypto product in
the United States turns on whether the product is defined as a security
or a commodity. Bitcoin was defined early on, in 2015, as a commodity,
and so is regulated by the CFTC. FTT—or for that matter a leveraged
Bitcoin token—would likely be defined as a security and so fall under
the jurisdiction of the SEC.</p>
<p>At that moment, in early 2021, both agencies were sort of claiming
authority, but neither was doing much with it. With no rules in place,
the people who opened crypto businesses in the US were constantly at
risk of lawsuits and fines over anything they weren’t explicitly
permitted to do—which, apart from buying and selling bitcoin, was
basically everything. Crypto people would implore the regulators for
permission to sell a new crypto token, or to pay interest on crypto
deposits or create a crypto futures contract; the regulators would hem
and haw; the crypto people would push ahead and actually do something,
and the regulators would sanction them. “It’s a game of twenty questions
with the regulators, but if you ask the wrong question, you get fined,”
explained Sam.</p>
<p>As for the venture capitalists, Sam had no real experience with them:
this was an entirely new game. Ramnik watched him figure out how to play
it. In early 2021, Jump Trading—not a conventional venture
capitalist—offered to buy a stake in FTX at a company valuation of
billion. “Sam said no, the fundraise is at twenty billion,” recalled
Ramnik. Jump responded by saying that they’d be interested at that price
if Sam could find others who were too—which told you that the value
people assigned to new businesses was arbitrary.</p>
<p>Selling a new business to a VC was apparently less like selling a
sofa than it was like pitching a movie idea. The VCs’ eagerness to buy
turned less on your hard numbers than on how excited they became about
the story you told. It was as if they spent their day listening to
stories and picking the ones they liked best. There was no rhyme or
reason to their evaluations: English class all over again. Sam quickly
figured out that most of the stories these people heard were just not
very persuasive. “Most people tell stories that are trivial to falsify,”
he said. The story he and Ramnik told was not that way. It went roughly
as follows:</p>
<p>Global stocks traded 00 billion a day, crypto was now trading 00
billion each day, and the gap was closing. Inside of eighteen months,
FTX had gone from nothing to the world’s fifth-biggest crypto exchange,
and every day, it was seizing market share from its competitors. They
were now the only crypto exchange making a priority of obtaining
licenses and going legit. They were also the only crypto exchange that
hadn’t in one way or another offended US financial regulators. Once
licensed in the United States, a crypto exchange like FTX could also
trade stocks or anything else people wanted to trade and challenge, for
example, the New York Stock Exchange. To that end, Sam had already
incorporated a business called FTX US—but was being careful about
allowing customers to trade stuff on it of which the SEC might
disapprove. “The argument was, ‘Look how fast we’re growing, the market
is huge—and we’re going to be the credible party,’” said Ramnik.</p>
<p>There was a circularity to their situation. To be the credible party,
it would help to have money from fancy venture capitalists. To get the
VCs’ money, they needed to be the credible party. And yet it was all so
loosey-goosey. After hearing their pitch, one fund sent them a term
sheet and said, “We love you so much just fill in a number.” Sam filled
in a number: 0 billion. The fund went quiet for a bit and then, when
Ramnik called, said they’d changed their mind. A British venture capital
firm oddly named Hedosophia called and offered to pay what Sam asked—and
hand over 00 million for a 0.05 percent stake in FTX. Ramnik hardly knew
who they were and so arranged a call with them. “It was weird,” he said.
“I felt they didn’t know enough about the business. Basic shit like they
didn’t know that FTX US existed.”</p>
<p>Even so, the Hedosophia people sent Ramnik a term sheet—only to
change their minds after a mini crash in crypto prices and withdraw it.
A guy from Blackstone, the world’s biggest private investment firm,
called Sam to say that he thought a valuation of 0 billion was too
high—and that Blackstone would invest at a valuation of 5 billion. “Sam
said, ‘If you think it is too high, I’ll let you short a billion of our
stock at a valuation of twenty billion,’” recalled Ramnik. “The guy
said, ‘We don’t short stock.’ And Sam said that if you worked at Jane
Street you’d be fired the first week.”fn3</p>
<p>Even if the VCs didn’t all realize that Sam was playing a video game
at the same time that he was talking to them, most sensed that he didn’t
care what they had to say. Ramnik came to think that Sam’s indifference
to their feelings actually heightened their interest in him. That FTX
was profitable and didn’t really need the money probably also helped. In
the end, between the summer of 2020 and the spring of 2021, in four
rounds of fundraising, they sold roughly 6 percent of the company for .3
billion. Roughly one hundred fifty different venture capital firms
invested. All of them caved to Sam’s refusal to give them a seat on the
board (he had no board) or any other form of control over the
business.</p>
<p>And yet FTX was just a piece of a much larger puzzle of Sam’s design.
He owned 90 percent of Alameda Research. And the nature of Alameda
Research was changing. It was still a quant trading firm, with its good
months and bad months, but its traders were playing, in new ways, with
bigger and bigger sums of money. Crypto world had created what were, in
effect, unregulated new banks. People would deposit their crypto with,
for instance, Genesis Global Capital or Celsius Network, and receive
some rate of interest, and these pseudobanks would re-lend the crypto to
traders like Alameda Research. In early 2018, rich effective altruists
had charged Sam interest rates of 50 percent a year. Three years later,
Genesis and Celsius were willing to lend billions to Alameda Research at
interest rates that ranged from 6 to 20 percent. And there were other,
even more mysterious billions inside of Alameda that no one knew about.
“FTX is smaller than people think, and Alameda is bigger,” said Ramnik.
“Way bigger.”</p>
<p>It was never clear where Alameda Research stopped and FTX started.
Legally separate companies, they were both owned by the same person.
They occupied the same big room on the twenty-sixth floor of an office
building. They shared the same vista of the forest of high-rises
surrounding Victoria Harbor and, twenty miles beyond that, China. Sam’s
desk was positioned at one end of the identical long trading desks used
by both Alameda and FTX, with a clear view of both. It didn’t occur to
anyone that there was anything weird about Alameda covering the start-up
costs of somewhere between million and 0 million for FTX. Ditto FTX
selling FTT and using the capital not to expand FTX but to trade inside
Alameda. It seemed perfectly natural for Alameda to control all the
remaining FTT, and use it as collateral in its trading activity. Sam
didn’t even try to hide what he was doing. FTT “has single-handedly
fixed [Alameda’s] equity problem,” he wrote, in a memo to employees. He
retained 90 percent of Alameda Research, with Gary owning the remaining
10 percent. Even after he’d sold stakes in FTX to the one hundred fifty
venture capitalists, Sam still owned more than half the company. The
third-largest shareholder, Nishad, owned a mere 5 percent of the
company.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sam sort of ran both and neither. Much of his day
was spent promoting FTX and himself to the outside world. And as FTX
boomed, he found it harder to find people of whom he approved to work
for Alameda. Qualified people might turn up looking for work at Alameda,
but the moment they saw FTX’s growth they would say that, no, actually,
they’d rather work for FTX. “It became almost impossible to find smart
people who wanted to work at Alameda,” he said. To manage the place, he
felt he was sort of stuck with the people already there.</p>
<p>He wasn’t able to run the day-to-day trading operations at Alameda
and also play this new and unfamiliar role as the face of the booming
FTX franchise. Seeing no single person inside of Alameda qualified to
run it, Sam handed the job to two people. The first was a clever but
socially awkward trader named Sam Trabucco whom he’d known since high
school math camp and hired away the year before from the high-frequency
trading firm Susquehanna. Right away Trabucco had established himself as
the only person who could rival Sam Bankman-Fried in his devotion to
crypto trading: he could go weeks without ever leaving the Hong Kong
office. The moment Sam promoted him, his interest in work collapsed,
however, and he discovered a new taste for life’s pleasures. The
shocking shift inside Sam Trabucco in the late summer of 2021 was hard
to explain but impossible to deny. “The moment he became co-head of
Alameda he checked out,” said an Alameda employee.</p>
<p>That left Sam’s private hedge fund in the hands of its other co-CEO,
Caroline Ellison. When he’d named her to the job, Sam imagined Caroline
managing the people, while Sam Trabucco managed the trading risks.
“People really liked being managed by her,” he said. By the fall of 2021
Caroline was effectively managing both the people and the trading risk
while herself being managed only by Sam. This created some
complications. The two were now leading a secret life, and it bothered
Caroline a lot more than it did Sam. She wanted to improve and expand
their relationship; he wanted … well, not to. After he’d split for Hong
Kong, Sam had replied to Caroline’s first memo with a memo of his own,
laying out the pros and cons of a sexual relationship. It began with a
seriously compelling list, titled: ARGUMENTS AGAINST:</p>
<p>In a lot of ways I don’t really have a soul. This is a lot more
obvious in some contexts than others. But in the end there’s a pretty
decent argument that my empathy is fake, my feelings are fake, my facial
reactions are fake. I don’t feel happiness. What’s the point in dating
someone who you physically can’t make happy?</p>
<p>I have a long history of getting bored and claustrophobic. This has
the makings of a time when I’m less worried about it than normal; but
the baseline prior might be high enough that nothing else matters.</p>
<p>I feel conflicted about what I want. Sometimes I really want to be
with you. Sometimes I want to stay at work for 60 hours straight and not
think about anything else.</p>
<p>I’m worried about power dynamics between us.</p>
<p>This could destroy Alameda if it goes really poorly PR-wise.</p>
<p>This combos really badly with the current EA shitshow I’m supposed to
be, in some ways, adjudicating.</p>
<p>I make people sad. Even people who I inspire, I don’t really make
happy. And people who I date—it’s really harrowing. It really fucking
sucks, to be with someone who (a) you can’t make happy, (b) doesn’t
really respect anyone else, (c) is constantly thinking really offensive
things, (d) doesn’t have time for you, and (e) wants to be alone half
the time.</p>
<p>There are a lot of really fucked up things about dating an
employee.</p>
<p>This list was followed by another, briefer list, titled “ARGUMENTS IN
FAVOR.”</p>
<p>I really fucking like you.</p>
<p>I really like talking to you. I feel a lot less worried about saying
what’s on my mind to you than to almost anyone else.</p>
<p>You share my most important interests.</p>
<p>You’re a good person.</p>
<p>I really like fucking you.</p>
<p>You’re smart and impressive.</p>
<p>You have good judgement and aren’t full of shit.</p>
<p>You appreciate a lot of me for who I am.</p>
<p>She’d still followed him from Berkeley to Hong Kong and reentered
their relationship. Two years later, its contours hadn’t changed. Sam
was better able to see the reasons why he might have feelings for
Caroline than he was to experience those feelings. Caroline wanted a
conventional love with an unconventional man. Sam wanted to do whatever
at any given moment offered the highest expected value, and his estimate
of her expected value seemed to peak right before they had sex and
plummet immediately after. Caroline didn’t like it and let him know, in
a series of long, businesslike memos. “There are things I want out of
our relationship that I feel like I’m not getting to the extent I want,”
she wrote, in early July 2021. The usual bullet points followed:</p>
<p>Communication about our feelings and preferences</p>
<p>Consistent affirmation/positive reinforcement</p>
<p>Social affirmation of our relationship in at least some context</p>
<p>Sam had a list in his head of all the bad things that might occur if
people knew they were sleeping together. Caroline thought that Sam’s
list masked his true motives. “I guess a lot of what bothers me is
feeling like you’re ashamed of me,” she added, six days later, in a
follow-up memo, before explaining how and why that bothered her.</p>
<p>I feel excited about people knowing we’re dating; in past
relationships I definitely haven’t always felt that way, and it came
down to whether I was embarrassed by that person, and whether I thought
people would think worse/better of me for dating them.</p>
<p>If I felt you also felt positively about people knowing we were
dating but just thought it was a bad idea to share, I think I wouldn’t
mind as much.</p>
<p>Again, I feel like if I were better/more impressive, you wouldn’t be
embarrassed for people to know we were dating.</p>
<p>Their deep interests remained unaligned. Caroline sensed that, even
as Sam promoted her to CEO of Alameda Research, he disapproved of her
job performance—and she shared his opinion. “It feels like I’m doing a
much worse job managing Alameda than you would if you were working on it
full-time,” she wrote, in a follow-up to the follow-up, “and I’m going
to fuck up important things if you don’t step in sometimes.”</p>
<p>Eighteen months earlier, Alameda Research had been limping along with
0 million in capital from a handful of effective altruist friends. It
now had billions in it, much of it borrowed from strangers at
pseudobanks, and a stash of lesser-known cryptocurrencies, like FTT,
worth between zero dollars and 0 billion, depending on who was doing the
counting. The job had become more complicated. She clearly needed help.
Once again she was thinking aloud to her boss about either quitting her
job or breaking up with him, or both.</p>
<p>Before she could do either, Sam left again, in August 2021, on
another trip—to the Bahamas, to see if maybe it might serve as host to a
satellite office or a disaster recovery site if, say, the Chinese
government shut them down. He liked the place so much that, pretty much
on the spot, he decided to stay. For the second time in three years he
messaged a group of people he was meant to be leading to say he wouldn’t
be coming back.</p>
