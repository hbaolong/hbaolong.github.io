<h4 id="the-daughters-of-mineas">THE DAUGHTERS OF MINEAS</h4>
<p>I sing here of Mineas’ daughters three,1</p>
<p>Minions devoted, from their infancy,</p>
<p>To Pallas and her arts,2 and against whom</p>
<p>A jealous Bacchus3 would long fret and fume,</p>
<p>Rightfully fearful lest he be outdone.</p>
<p>For every deity would be the one</p>
<p>To earn Man’s gratitude. When fallow field</p>
<p>Rewards the master’s industry, to yield</p>
<p>Rich bounty, surely it must be because,</p>
<p>With sacred pomp, he honors Ceres’4 laws.</p>
<p>Now, Greece, it happened, was in celebration,</p>
<p>Gracing Semele’s son. Of all the nation</p>
<p>Only three sisters saw fit to condemn</p>
<p>This show of holy zeal. Indeed, for them</p>
<p>It was a shameful feast. Alcithoe,</p>
<p>Bobbins in hand—the eldest of the three—</p>
<p>Without the least ado, says: “Fie! Oh, fie!</p>
<p>Why must there be so many new gods?… Why,</p>
<p>Olympus even now can scarce contain</p>
<p>All the old bigwigs lodged in its demesne!</p>
<p>Nor has the year sufficient days therein,</p>
<p>Whereon to fete more gods, day out day in!</p>
<p>I plead no cause against that great god who</p>
<p>Wrought many a labor, to whom thanks are due</p>
<p>For purging mankind of its monsters, curse</p>
<p>And scourge that once had plagued the universe!</p>
<p>But Bacchus? Of what earthly use is he?</p>
<p>Little he does but foment rivalry,</p>
<p>Quarrels, disorder… Weaken the most strong,</p>
<p>Make crones of the most fair, drag Man along</p>
<p>The dankmost, dismal paths to Styx’s shore!</p>
<p>For likes of him we need one feast day more,</p>
<p>Free from our work?… Well, I shall not shirk mine,</p>
<p>My sisters! I propose, this day divine,</p>
<p>That we, to while away the hours, relate</p>
<p>A story, rather than to celebrate</p>
<p>That blackguard! I myself could, for example,</p>
<p>Tell of the monarch of the gods, with ample</p>
<p>Tales of his numerous transformations. But</p>
<p>Methinks you know them all; and, therefore, what</p>
<p>I would suggest is that each of us tell</p>
<p>Some feat of love, and how a demoiselle—</p>
<p>Like one of us—becomes its victim. Ah!</p>
<p>Not all its pleasures, joys—et cetera,</p>
<p>Et cetera!—that spread its poison through</p>
<p>Our hearts! For, quite like Bacchus, it can do</p>
<p>Great damage to our reason! Rather, let us</p>
<p>Recount the woes its evil deeds beget us.”</p>
<p>Alcithoe fell silent, whereupon,</p>
<p>After her sisters’ plaudits, she went on,</p>
<p>Raising her voice a bit: “In Thebes, they say,</p>
<p>Two young and gentle souls, in bygone day,</p>
<p>Loved one another. Piramus was he,</p>
<p>And Thisbe, she, his mistress… Perfectly,</p>
<p>Each for the other fit: the lad, most fair,</p>
<p>And the lass, fair no less… A winsome pair</p>
<p>If ever such there was, pleasing of mien</p>
<p>And manner, with love’s tenderest ties between,</p>
<p>Binding their hearts. But oh! No sooner these</p>
<p>Feelings sprang forth than their two families</p>
<p>Conceived a hatred that, the more it grew,</p>
<p>The stronger still Love’s bonds that bound these two.</p>
<p>Well, chance it was, not choice, that had designed</p>
<p>To place their houses side by side, inclined</p>
<p>To constant discord. Thus propinquity</p>
<p>Favored the passion that each vis-à-vis</p>
<p>The other found a-borning. First, in mere</p>
<p>Innocent pastimes; for, so young and dear</p>
<p>Were they that, even when the spark was lit,</p>
<p>They little guessed what flames would swell from it.</p>
<p>And so they innocently forged their love</p>
<p>The while, that their fell parents knew naught of.</p>
<p>Now, anything forbidden will, for sure,</p>
<p>Charm with its spice those who fall to its lure,</p>
<p>And love especially! Thus did it teach</p>
<p>Our pair, from in their houses, each to each,</p>
<p>To sigh with sign and glance: back, forth they sent them…</p>
<p>But this slight solace could not long content them.</p>
<p>Both would a better secret means discover</p>
<p>Whereby to plight their troth, lover to lover;</p>
<p>To wit, and ancient wall that long had stood</p>
<p>Between their dwellings twain, through which they could—</p>
<p>Thanks to the ravages of time—deplore</p>
<p>Their fate. But words alone, and nothing more,</p>
<p>Are little comfort… Thus did Piramus</p>
<p>Say one day: ’Heaven above would succor us,</p>
<p>Dear Thisbe. Those in love must clever be</p>
<p>To end their woes. Our parents’ tyranny</p>
<p>Keeps us from meeting… Let us flee this place</p>
<p>And fly to Greece. For there, some of my race</p>
<p>Abide, who shall, I guarantee you, make</p>
<p>You welcome in their midst, as I partake</p>
<p>Graciously of their power and pelf. Such do</p>
<p>I wish only that it might profit you</p>
<p>And give you pleasure. For myself, no matter!</p>
<p>My heart, be still, lest evil tongues may natter</p>
<p>On and on, and impugn your chastity</p>
<p>With their vile chatter… Tell me, what shall be</p>
<p>Your will? What would you have me do? Your merest</p>
<p>Wish will be my command, O Thisbe dearest!</p>
<p>I love you more than life itself, and thus</p>
<p>Will do your bidding.’ ‘Ah, sweet Piramus,’</p>
<p>Thisbe replied, ’well might I say the same.</p>
<p>And since your love is pure and free of blame,</p>
<p>Though passing passionate it be, lead on,</p>
<p>And I indeed shall follow you anon,</p>
<p>Whither you will. And I shall laugh, and pay</p>
<p>No heed to what the scandalmongers say,</p>
<p>But shall yield to your ardor’s flame, content</p>
<p>That my good name is no mere ornament.’</p>
<p>“Imagine, pray, the pleasure this reply</p>
<p>Wrought in the heart of Piramus, for try</p>
<p>Would I in vain; and, though attempt I might,</p>
<p>You ought paint for yourself the wild delight</p>
<p>His lover’s words brought forth. Said he: ’At day’s</p>
<p>First glimpse, before Dawn’s chariot casts its rays,</p>
<p>We shall depart. Go to the steps that lie</p>
<p>Beside Ceres’s statue. There, hard by,</p>
<p>Next to the shore, a bark stands ready. In it</p>
<p>Oarsmen await. We must not waste a minute,</p>
<p>But fly we shall while fair the wind, and while</p>
<p>The auguries and omens chance to smile</p>
<p>Upon us. For the gods’ and Destiny’s</p>
<p>Designs will favor us.’ Thisbe agrees</p>
<p>To everything; as proof thereof she would</p>
<p>Bestow two kisses had the wall not stood</p>
<p>Betwixt her and her Piramus. And thus</p>
<p>The wall it was she kissed: fortuitous,</p>
<p>Fortunate wall! You should have better served</p>
<p>These lovers, who better and more deserved</p>
<p>From you than pleasure’s shade… Well, the next day,</p>
<p>An eager Thisbe, yielding to the sway</p>
<p>Of rash impatience, unaccompanied,</p>
<p>Makes her way to the steps, as was agreed.</p>
<p>Nor has her lover yet arrived, as there,</p>
<p>Shadow and light do battle in the air,</p>
<p>Over the azured fields. But as she was</p>
<p>Waiting, a frightful lioness, with jaws</p>
<p>And claws bloodied from recent kill, drew near…</p>
<p>Thisbe takes to her heels… Ah! But her fear</p>
<p>Will have most fell, cruel consequences. For,</p>
<p>As she goes running off, the veil she wore</p>
<p>Blows from her body and, caught by the breeze,</p>
<p>Falls to the ground. The lioness will seize</p>
<p>It, rend it, sully it with gore, whereon</p>
<p>She drops it, lets it lie, turns, and is gone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile has Thisbe hidden in the thick</p>
<p>Underbrush. Thereupon, the passion-sick</p>
<p>Piramus comes, looks down, gapes with chagrin</p>
<p>Upon the remnant of what once had been</p>
<p>A veil… Alas! His Thisbe’s veil!… ’Is that…</p>
<p>Is it…’ His veins run cold. He stares thereat,</p>
<p>Disconsolate, undone… Looks roundabout…</p>
<p>Ah! The blood-spattered tracks leave little doubt!</p>
<p>‘Thisbe! My Thisbe!’ he cries out, dismayed,</p>
<p>Distraught. ’Now is the everlasting Shade</p>
<p>Your dark abode! What have I wrought? Ah me!</p>
<p>I am the monster who this destiny</p>
<p>Has brought about!… Wait! Slacken, pray, your course!</p>
<p>For I follow behind, and would, perforce,</p>
<p>Join you beside the drear and brackish shore.</p>
<p>But do I dare? How might I stand before</p>
<p>Your face? I, source of this disaster, who</p>
<p>Have naught but this, my blood, to offer you,</p>
<p>And but one death to die!’ So saying, he takes</p>
<p>Dagger in hand, all breath of hope forsakes,</p>
<p>And cuts the thread of life. As he does thus,</p>
<p>Thisbe returns. She sees her Piramus</p>
<p>Fall to the ground… What happened then? She fell</p>
<p>Into a swoon, senseless and mute as well.</p>
<p>But soon, when she once more regains her wits,</p>
<p>Clotho, touched by the love she bore, permits</p>
<p>Piramus, then, to open—dim—his eyes.</p>
<p>With dying glance he looks not on the skies</p>
<p>Above, but on his Thisbe, He would speak,</p>
<p>Tries… But unstrung, alas, his tongue, too weak,</p>
<p>Refuses. Yet his eyes, in place thereof,</p>
<p>Reveal his joy at having seen his love.</p>
<p>As thus he dies, she takes his blade and, there,</p>
<p>Bares her breast, saying: ’I shall not declare</p>
<p>That you have erred in your design. Ah no!</p>
<p>Nor that your fears were reasonless. For so</p>
<p>To do would say that you loved me too well!</p>
<p>But can one love too much? Ah! Truth to tell,</p>
<p>I love you no whit less, nor jot nor tittle,</p>
<p>And you shall see, my heart deserves as little</p>
<p>As yours the agony it must endure!</p>
<p>Alas! I die! So be it, mon amour,</p>
<p>Accept my sacrifice!’ At this, the blade</p>
<p>Performs its deadly task… Down falls the maid—</p>
<p>But drapes her garments properly lest she,</p>
<p>Exposed, betray her virgin modesty—</p>
<p>Virtuous to the last. The Nymphs about her</p>
<p>Wept for the life that must go on without her,</p>
<p>And, with the blood of the two lovers, they</p>
<p>Becharmed a nearby bush which, till that day,</p>
<p>Grew hoary white, and dyed its berries red,</p>
<p>Tribute to true love’s glory, so ’tis said.”</p>
<p>This story moved Mineas’ daughters greatly.</p>
<p>One of them blamed the lover, said irately</p>
<p>That all the fault was his; the other claimed</p>
<p>Fate was the villain. But each of them blamed</p>
<p>The human heart; on this did they agree:</p>
<p>Passion ought not command us. Rather, we</p>
<p>Should be its masters. It, at times, will die</p>
<p>Before one has a chance to satisfy</p>
<p>Its rash demands; at other times it might</p>
<p>Long languish unfulfilled. But never right</p>
<p>Is it to reap its gentle fruits unless</p>
<p>Marriage has solemnized its tenderness.</p>
<p>Yet wedded life, much though one first enjoys it,</p>
<p>Is also what, in time alas, destroys it.</p>
<p>“Jealousy,” says Clymene, “is the foul</p>
<p>Poison that bides with marriage, cheek by jowl.</p>
<p>Procris provides me all the proof I need.</p>
<p>Alcithoe my sister has, indeed,</p>
<p>Regaled your hearts with tale of tragic love,</p>
<p>Choosing the foremost and most fell thereof</p>
<p>To tell. Now, I would warrant, mine bestirs</p>
<p>The heart no less pathetically than hers,</p>
<p>And it will pass as well the time today.</p>
<p>Already Phoebus courses on his way.5</p>
<p>Best veil ourselves lest, with his piercing powers,</p>
<p>He cast his rays. Best, too, this work of ours—</p>
<p>Our tapestries—be wrought in timely wise.</p>
<p>I would see mine take shape before my eyes</p>
<p>Whilst there is light. Still, I ask that you but</p>
<p>Sit silent for an hour nor try to shut</p>
<p>My mouth uncouth, but rather think how well you</p>
<p>May profit from the tale I have to tell you.</p>
<p>“Good spouses twain—Procris and Cephalus—</p>
<p>Enjoyed a marriage most harmonious.</p>
<p>She—Procris—loved by him, and he, no less</p>
<p>By her. Each said their passion’s tenderness</p>
<p>Might be a model, so great was their measure</p>
<p>Of both love’s piquant joy and gentle pleasure.</p>
<p>(Why, almost did they love as much as do</p>
<p>A mistress and her paramour, these two!)</p>
<p>Heaven itself envied that harmony</p>
<p>Of theirs; and soon a certain deity</p>
<p>Caused Cephalus much grief. Young, handsome lad,</p>
<p>It came to pass that dawn—Aurora—had</p>
<p>Taken a fancy to him! For, among</p>
<p>The gods she found none both so fair and young.</p>
<p>(Her spouse especially!) Now, here below,</p>
<p>Our belles would not go brashly chasing beaux,</p>
<p>But would hide their affection, goodness knows!</p>
<p>Not so, young goddesses! Even less, those</p>
<p>With husbands long of tooth! And so our goddess</p>
<p>Revealed the fire that flamed beneath her bodice,</p>
<p>Apprising Cephalus, who, though he pled</p>
<p>That he was happily, faithfully wed,</p>
<p>Failed to convince her, and she promptly bore him</p>
<p>Shamelessly off, and laid her love before him.</p>
<p>Cephalus, loyal swain, begged her, entreated</p>
<p>That she temper her passion’s fire, too heated;</p>
<p>The which, indeed, she did: her love became</p>
<p>That simple sentiment that bears the name</p>
<p>Of ‘friendship.’ ‘Go,’ she told him, ’to your wife.</p>
<p>I shall not spread a pall upon your life</p>
<p>And hers, nor quell the ardor that you feel.</p>
<p>Let me but give this token of my zeal,</p>
<p>This gift…’ (It was a lance that never missed</p>
<p>Its mark.) ’Much though Procris claim to exist</p>
<p>For you alone, forsooth, the day will come</p>
<p>When you will suffer your soul’s martyrdom,</p>
<p>And will, in truth, despair, distraught that you</p>
<p>Have loved the wench as much as now you do.’</p>
<p>Needless to say, an oracle’s prediction</p>
<p>Is never clear, and may be a mere fiction</p>
<p>Rather than fact. But this one caused deep doubt</p>
<p>In Cephalus’s soul, nor cast it out</p>
<p>Could he. ’What? I shall be distraught? Despair</p>
<p>That I have loved so much? What foul affair</p>
<p>Is this? Can there be something much amiss</p>
<p>Betwixt my love and me? Is my Procris</p>
<p>Unfaithful? Can it be? Ah! Sooner would</p>
<p>I die than doubt her loyal wifelihood!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I fancy it is best</p>
<p>To put her duty squarely to the test</p>
<p>And see what may betide.’ To soothsayers, thus,</p>
<p>He goes, asks their advice illustrious…</p>
<p>Whence, feigning by his dress and air to be</p>
<p>A yearning youth, seeks Procris, eagerly</p>
<p>Plying her with most flattering phrases, sighing</p>
<p>Sighs for her face divine, sobbing and crying</p>
<p>Tears from his eyes, cajoling, begging… But</p>
<p>Hard though he tries, it makes no difference what</p>
<p>He does or says: she spurns the lover’s skill;</p>
<p>Whereat he must essay the means that will</p>
<p>Succeed (as ever!): precious gifts bestowed,</p>
<p>Or at least promised… Ill did it forbode,</p>
<p>For, so much will he straightway offer her</p>
<p>That soon she seems less eager to demur…</p>
<p>Alas! Everything has its price. At last,</p>
<p>Cephalus, sore distressed, downcast—aghast,</p>
<p>In fact—decides to take his leave; forsakes</p>
<p>The pleasure of the city, and betakes</p>
<p>Himself off to the woods, baring his breast</p>
<p>To tree and wind, sure that the hunt will wrest</p>
<p>Him from his jealous agony. It was</p>
<p>The season when the day’s hot gusts will cause</p>
<p>All those who breathe to languish for the balm</p>
<p>Of Zephyr’s cooling breezes, wafting calm.</p>
<p>‘Come, come, O tender winds,’ softly he cries.</p>
<p>’Come, lightsome wind-sprites, render me your sighs,</p>
<p>You by whose breath our fields put forth their flowers.</p>
<p>Adored wind-goddess Aure, pray use your powers</p>
<p>To summon them; you, by whose gentle word</p>
<p>All is restored to life!’ His voice is heard.</p>
<p>But those who hear suppose the object is</p>
<p>Some creature other than that wife of his!</p>
<p>Zealous, they tell her so, whence promptly she</p>
<p>Grows jealous of her rival. Charity</p>
<p>Dictates that many a friend, intent to flout it,</p>
<p>Touched by her woe, prates on and on about it.</p>
<p>‘So! I must see him only in my dreams,’</p>
<p>She moans. ’Now he forsakes me, so it seems,</p>
<p>For some perfidious wench by name of Aure!…’</p>
<p>‘Oh, how we pity you,’ they sighed. ’But more</p>
<p>And more he loves, calls her. Always her name</p>
<p>Springs to his lips, rings out… Always the same,</p>
<p>The echoes’ task: to sing throughout the wood</p>
<p>Aure’s name… Aure’s name… But only for your good,</p>
<p>Dear friend, do we inform you, and suggest</p>
<p>You take to heart what we have told you. Best</p>
<p>You think on it.’ The which, indeed, she did.</p>
<p>And endlessly… For lovers cannot rid</p>
<p>Their heads of jealous thoughts. If only they</p>
<p>Had enough reason to keep but a ray</p>
<p>Of sense and judgment to illuminate</p>
<p>Their way! (“Judgment”? In love? One could await</p>
<p>A miracle for such!) They might remain</p>
<p>Untouched by tongues’ reports, or even feign</p>
<p>That they were deaf!… Our spouse did neither!… Well,</p>
<p>One day, as blushing dawn laid her deep spell</p>
<p>Of sleep on one and all—all but a rare</p>
<p>Hunter or two, that is—our Procris fair</p>
<p>Will rise and set off for the wood to see</p>
<p>If Cephalus is there. Next moment, she</p>
<p>Spies him, hears him already crying out</p>
<p>To that Aure, her, the one they spoke about:</p>
<p>‘Come, dearest goddess! Come,’ he cries. ’I waste</p>
<p>Away, I languish, die… Pray you make haste</p>
<p>And ease the woe that must my very life</p>
<p>Forthwith lay low!’ Hearing these words, his wife</p>
<p>Seeks not the sense that truly lies behind them,</p>
<p>But, heartsore, gives ear, and will sooner find them</p>
<p>Proof of the perfidy that her suspicion</p>
<p>Lays clear before her. O pain! O perdition!</p>
<p>O bitter passion, you, vain jealousy!</p>
<p>Daughter of mad love, error’s progeny!</p>
<p>Much do your eyes refuse to see; and yet,</p>
<p>What they do show you makes you fuss, and fret,</p>
<p>And suffer without cause! Procris had gone</p>
<p>To hide within a thicket that a fawn</p>
<p>Was using for his lair. Disquieted,</p>
<p>The beast springs out. Whereon our spouse, misled</p>
<p>By the noise, takes his lance—the one that, ever</p>
<p>True to the mark, hits home, whithersoever—</p>
<p>And flings it thither… But the mark it hits</p>
<p>Is not, alas, the beast! A fierce cry splits</p>
<p>The air… Misery me! It is his own</p>
<p>Dear wife!… He runs to see… With many a moan</p>
<p>He realizes, there, before his eyes,</p>
<p>Losing his wits, that, in most murderous wise,</p>
<p>He has cut short her jealous life. Wherefore</p>
<p>Would he cut short his own as well. What’s more,</p>
<p>He tries to do so with the selfsame lance…</p>
<p>Aurora and the Fates look much askance</p>
<p>On such intent, making bold to prevent it.</p>
<p>But, though their intercession was well meant, it</p>
<p>Proved more severe than thoughtful, for he kept</p>
<p>Pounding his breast with woeful mien, and wept</p>
<p>So many a tear that he might have created</p>
<p>Fountains galore, abounding unabated,</p>
<p>Had not the goddess called on Fate to cut</p>
<p>His days’ dire thread: unhappy end to what</p>
<p>Had been a curious marriage!… Sisters mine,</p>
<p>I cannot say enough, ’Best we resign</p>
<p>Ourselves to life unwed.’ For, if the best</p>
<p>Is such, judge how much worse must be the rest!</p>
<p>And, if we may not love save in the thrall</p>
<p>Of wedlock, better we not love at all!”</p>
<p>They agree. And, befall what may, all three</p>
<p>Gladly accept their loveless destiny.</p>
<p>To rid them of their drear thoughts they return</p>
<p>To task of more immediate concern:</p>
<p>Their tapestries. Clymene’s was near done,</p>
<p>Picturing on a cloth most richly spun</p>
<p>The famous quarrel that had raged betwixt</p>
<p>Two gods, to see whose name would be affixed</p>
<p>To a new city—one that you could see</p>
<p>Dimly, far off, in her embroidery:</p>
<p>Neptune’s? Wise Pallas’s?… Each would bestow</p>
<p>A gift, and that boon would decide, just so,</p>
<p>Whose name should win. Neptune, in warlike wise,</p>
<p>With a blow of his trident, caused to rise</p>
<p>Out of the ground a charger, full of fire,</p>
<p>That all who saw it could not but admire.</p>
<p>Present most splendid! But Minerva found</p>
<p>A finer yet: she gave the country round</p>
<p>The olive tree, symbol of wisdom, whence</p>
<p>She chose the city’s name. In consequence</p>
<p>Thereof, did Athens—now thus called—present</p>
<p>Its homage to her, with magnificent</p>
<p>Tribute galore. To offer it to her,</p>
<p>A hundred virgins wise, and prettier</p>
<p>Each than the last, in bobbin-skills abounding,</p>
<p>Bore the gifts of all kinds, or stood surrounding</p>
<p>The goddess of the gray-green eyes… And she,</p>
<p>With a sweet gaze, smiled on their fealty.</p>
<p>Clymene, now concluding, folds away</p>
<p>Her work, falls still, so that young Iris may</p>
<p>Regale them next. And she commences thus:</p>
<p>“Sisters, I fear not very copious</p>
<p>In tearful subject is my repertory.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you say you wish a story</p>
<p>And story you shall have. I tell you of</p>
<p>Telamon, him whose soul burned hot with love</p>
<p>For Cloris, who yearned for him quite as much.</p>
<p>Good breeding, beauty, sense, the graces… Such</p>
<p>Were the fine qualities that each possessed;</p>
<p>Everything save that one, that veriest,</p>
<p>Most necessary one that, here below,</p>
<p>Rules above all the rest: to wit, wealth! No,</p>
<p>Naught had they; and, although they would be wed,</p>
<p>For want of gold—that metal garlanded</p>
<p>With mankind’s homage and desire—they dare</p>
<p>Not share the nuptial bed, and must forswear</p>
<p>Fair Hymen.6 For, though love can do without it,</p>
<p>Wedlock cannot! Be there no doubt about it!</p>
<p>Right or wrong, such is Fate’s decree. At one’s</p>
<p>Own peril would one flout it. Telamon’s</p>
<p>Woes did not end thereat, however. For</p>
<p>More would he suffer when the imp of war—</p>
<p>Vile sprite—spread roundabout its foul intent</p>
<p>And fell design. Sought out, stoutly he went</p>
<p>To battle in a land’s defense against</p>
<p>Those who would conquer it. And so commenced</p>
<p>His feats of arms, and ended for a time</p>
<p>The gentler exercise of love sublime.</p>
<p>Cloris consents, but heartsick is she. Yet,</p>
<p>Eager is he to show the mignonnette</p>
<p>That she has reason to esteem him so</p>
<p>And give her heart to him. Off will he go</p>
<p>To battle… Now, it happens that, whilst he</p>
<p>Is gone, a member of her family,</p>
<p>Citizen of that very land, in fact—</p>
<p>The very one that has been so attacked,</p>
<p>And where her beau now wars… Well, as I said,</p>
<p>It happens that he dies, and, lying dead,</p>
<p>Has bequeathed Cloris his possessions: gold,</p>
<p>Treasure immense, a worldly wealth untold.</p>
<p>Whereupon she goes straightway thither. There,</p>
<p>Both sides behold her, find her passing fair.</p>
<p>She, meanwhile, sees the battlefield whereon</p>
<p>Her valorous, victorious Telamon</p>
<p>Has won the day, honoring her with his</p>
<p>Rare deeds; and, seeing her, how quick he is</p>
<p>To hasten to her side, offering her</p>
<p>All the fruits of the glorious vanquisher,</p>
<p>In the name of their love!… Fate would decree</p>
<p>That they would meet beside the open sea—</p>
<p>That element that all good lovers should</p>
<p>Eschew at any cost! Gladly they would,</p>
<p>Without ado, have joined their loves were it</p>
<p>The simple Age of Gold. Alas! Unfit</p>
<p>Were such in this, the Age of Iron. Thus</p>
<p>Cloris demurred. Far more felicitous</p>
<p>Would be a union celebrated with</p>
<p>The bounteous blessings of her kin and kith.</p>
<p>This she preferred; and so return they will,</p>
<p>Unconsummated… Their journey would fill</p>
<p>Many a torturous day if they betook</p>
<p>Themselves by land. Wherefore, instead, they look</p>
<p>Seaward, to spare the rigors of the road</p>
<p>And take them, timely-wise, to their abode</p>
<p>With Zephyr in their wake. When, with great joy,</p>
<p>They near their shore, they hear a fierce ‘Ahoy!’,</p>
<p>And spy a privateer, sheets to the wind,</p>
<p>Whose pirate crew, crass and undisciplined,</p>
<p>Attacks our doughty hero, who, despite</p>
<p>Stalwartly fighting to the end, is quite</p>
<p>Powerless to resist their might. Oh, Ods-</p>
<p>Bodkins! Who could have thought he would—ye gods!—</p>
<p>Become a galley slave? Fate pays no mind</p>
<p>To race and glory, and was ill inclined</p>
<p>To let his hoped-for happiness deflect</p>
<p>Her blows upon his honor and respect.</p>
<p>Cloris’s piteous pleadings too remained</p>
<p>Unheard, and Telemon languished, enchained.</p>
<p>“Now, Destiny, for her, was rather less</p>
<p>Unkind and more restrained in her duress.</p>
<p>A famous wealthy merchant bought her, bore</p>
<p>Her off to his domain where, more and more,</p>
<p>Slave though she was, she would enjoy a very</p>
<p>Honored position, most extraordinary.</p>
<p>The merchant’s wife—who, as it happens, views her</p>
<p>With great affection—will not only choose her</p>
<p>To wait on her, but will select the belle</p>
<p>To be the mistress to her son as well.</p>
<p>One and all would most gladly see them wed;</p>
<p>But she, with long-drawn sigh, dispirited,</p>
<p>Would reply to their urgings. Damon—he,</p>
<p>The son—will ply her with sweet gallantry,</p>
<p>Asking her thus: ’Milady, why oh why</p>
<p>Do tears bedew your cheeks? Why do you cry,</p>
<p>And sob, and sigh unceasing? Hide you some</p>
<p>Unspoken pain? Have your fair eyes become</p>
<p>Surfeited with the ravages their darts</p>
<p>Have wrought on my poor being, and with my heart’s</p>
<p>Undying flame? I pray you not conceal</p>
<p>Your woe. Here are you free: ’Tis I the real</p>
<p>And suffering slave! Is it this place, madame,</p>
<p>That so displeases you? If so, I am</p>
<p>Ready to change my dwelling for a new</p>
<p>And fairer one. I and my parents too—</p>
<p>Father and mother—willingly would seek</p>
<p>Another to your taste. You need but speak</p>
<p>Your will, and your desire will surely be</p>
<p>Fulfilled posthaste… Or do you longingly</p>
<p>Yearn for the riches you have lost? If so,</p>
<p>All we possess is yours. But you must know</p>
<p>That, much though you deserve a fortune rare,</p>
<p>Many another one, I vow, is there</p>
<p>Who would not hesitate to be so wed.</p>
<p>Lo! At your feet, my love, I lie!’ So said</p>
<p>The son. And Cloris fair, in fondest wise,</p>
<p>Eyes streaming tears, most winsomely replies:</p>
<p>’Good sir, your slightest qualities, and this</p>
<p>Delightful place, would fill with amorous bliss</p>
<p>Even the daughters of the gods. Believe me,</p>
<p>Slave though I am, I pray you not perceive me</p>
<p>To be ungrateful for your generous</p>
<p>Offers of wealth, for so discourteous</p>
<p>I should not be. But I must not give ear</p>
<p>To them, however much I might. Nor is it</p>
<p>Because my presence is no friendly visit</p>
<p>But, indeed, servitude. And though, withal,</p>
<p>Thanks to the gods, I suffer not the thrall</p>
<p>Of ignominious bondage, and am free</p>
<p>To live the values that society</p>
<p>Has bred in me, yet must I tell you—oh!</p>
<p>Can I, alas?—that most malapropos</p>
<p>It were to listen to the court you pay me.</p>
<p>What? Does my mournful sighing not betray me?</p>
<p>Another has my love: and if he be</p>
<p>In chains, or dead, for all eternity,</p>
<p>Even in hell itself I shall be his!</p>
<p>Could you esteem a heart, good sir, that is</p>
<p>Untrue? Could you love her who has no more</p>
<p>The charms and beauty that were hers before;</p>
<p>Who, twice a slave—to you and to her love—</p>
<p>Ill deserves and is most unworthy of</p>
<p>One such as you?’ Damon heard what she said,</p>
<p>And, though most touched and much discomfited,</p>
<p>Thought: ’Let us chase her from our mind. Let us</p>
<p>Flee from this place. In time her copious</p>
<p>Tears will abate. They always do! Let be</p>
<p>What will be in my absence. We shall see…’</p>
<p>With these words he embarks, leaves shore behind.</p>
<p>Sailing hither and yon, soon will he find</p>
<p>An untamed land and, thereupon puts in.</p>
<p>What does he see? Many a man whose skin</p>
<p>Bears proof of former bondage. Galley slaves</p>
<p>Had they all been, escaping on the waves</p>
<p>To refuge here… Now, of their number, one</p>
<p>None other was than our own Telamon.</p>
<p>Damon gazes upon him, notices</p>
<p>His stately air, his wit. And what he says</p>
<p>Moves him to admiration for the swain’s</p>
<p>Qualities, and to pity for his pains.</p>
<p>Soon are they friends, and Damon will confide</p>
<p>His passion for a slave who ought his bride</p>
<p>Become if she loved not a dead man! ’Yes,</p>
<p>She would prefer a corpse to me, no less!’</p>
<p>Cloris he then proceeds to paint, whereat</p>
<p>Telamon, stunned, dissembles and stands pat,</p>
<p>Revealing not the truth. Whereupon he,</p>
<p>It is decided, shall accompany</p>
<p>His comrade back to where said beauty saves—</p>
<p>For him!—that perfect love… Like errant knaves</p>
<p>The pair arrive. In vain Telamon tries</p>
<p>To hide behind the unwitting disguise</p>
<p>That time, woe, hardship have imposed. For now</p>
<p>Is he not as he was. And yet, somehow,</p>
<p>Cloris will recognize him, even though</p>
<p>His traveler’s pack bows him and bends him low.</p>
<p>A stranger’s eyes would not have known him; hers,</p>
<p>However, quickly pierce the voyager’s</p>
<p>Unhappy state: she swoons from love and shame;</p>
<p>And Telamon, in turn, does quite the same.</p>
<p>Later, when asked the cause of her distress,</p>
<p>She speaks it frankly; nor does one think less</p>
<p>Of her therefor. So guilelessly she tells</p>
<p>Her tale that one and all pity the belle’s</p>
<p>Misfortunes all the more. Damon proclaims</p>
<p>His passion changed: unselfish now his aims.</p>
<p>And they believe him—even though desire</p>
<p>Yields not to honor but that, quelled the fire,</p>
<p>Yet will it leave its traces… Yes, they do</p>
<p>Believe him; and, to prove his faith, these two</p>
<p>Would he see wed. Nor need they wait. For there</p>
<p>And then, he asks his parents to declare</p>
<p>His rival for Cloris’s hand to be</p>
<p>Their heir—a mark of generosity</p>
<p>Unheard-of in the land. And so, beside</p>
<p>An oak, spreading its shade at eventide,</p>
<p>Young man and maid were married… But, ah woe!</p>
<p>A neighbor child watched as, thereon, a crow</p>
<p>Went perching; and, with cursèd bow, he shot</p>
<p>His arrow at the bird. Alas, the tot</p>
<p>Aimed ill: it flew, rending the air, askew,</p>
<p>Transpiercing lover and belovèd too.</p>
<p>Slain on the spot, our Cloris gasps her last,</p>
<p>As with a piteous yearning she will cast</p>
<p>A glance at Telamon who, harrowed, sees</p>
<p>Approach the crowning stroke of Destiny’s</p>
<p>Decree. What? Gods above, can it be? What?</p>
<p>Is this the way dour Atropos7 will cut</p>
<p>His thread of life? ’Has Fate not done enough?</p>
<p>Must she deal death with such a rude rebuff?’</p>
<p>So saying, he sighs his final breath. Within</p>
<p>A trice, love—not the blow—has done him in.</p>
<p>His wound was slight, yet did he join the dead,</p>
<p>For he would follow whither Cloris led.</p>
<p>Both hasten to the Styx’s shore: man, wife,</p>
<p>Each at the same time will depart this life.</p>
<p>In one tomb lie together their remains,</p>
<p>And one eternal rest their souls contains.</p>
<p>Later, one wrote—though I cannot aver</p>
<p>The truth thereof—that they to statues were</p>
<p>Transformed, in marble: but doubtful is this</p>
<p>Very unlikely metamorphosis,</p>
<p>And few believe it.” “Ah! More than you know,</p>
<p>Iris,” Clymene answers. “For just so</p>
<p>Did a sage, seeking through our history</p>
<p>Models of love and virtue, tell to me</p>
<p>This tale. Much I admired and pitied these</p>
<p>Evil-starred lovers: both their destinies</p>
<p>Were finally to be joined. After so much</p>
<p>Despair abhorrent, they were now to touch</p>
<p>The moment of the joy that had so long</p>
<p>Evaded them. But nature loves to wrong</p>
<p>And cheat us; such her vile perversities,</p>
<p>I warrant. As our hands reach out to seize</p>
<p>Our prize, behold! It flees our grasp. The very</p>
<p>Gods take delight wreaking their arbitrary</p>
<p>Power upon us, to make sport of our</p>
<p>Fond hopes!” Says Iris: “Fie on woes! The hour</p>
<p>Grows late. The feast soon ends, thank heaven! We three</p>
<p>Have passed the time today most somberly,</p>
<p>Recounting tales that weaker souls would find</p>
<p>Most troubling. Let us now cleanse from our mind</p>
<p>Their deadly images. Best might I use</p>
<p>The time yet left to sing a hero whose</p>
<p>Humankind suffered change, but not in mien</p>
<p>And body: rather, one whose heart had been</p>
<p>Transformed by Love—indeed, a miracle</p>
<p>That will permit me in more lyrical,</p>
<p>Less tragic mode, to tell the tale, and one</p>
<p>That Love performs each day… Now then, Zoon</p>
<p>Was pleasing to the eye. But beauty can</p>
<p>Do little for one’s worth. Here was a man</p>
<p>Of unimpressive wit, of mood</p>
<p>Most sullen, whose glum attitude</p>
<p>Rendered him dull and beautiless withal.</p>
<p>He fled the cities, shunned the company</p>
<p>Of others, lived under a constant pall</p>
<p>Of shadowed gloom: the forest canopy</p>
<p>Was home to him as to the bears. He spent</p>
<p>His fairest days unloving, abstinent,</p>
<p>Indifferent utterly to love! ’So? We</p>
<p>Disparage love,’ you are about to say.</p>
<p>To which I would reply: ’Nay, nay!</p>
<p>Though I condemn its evident excesses,</p>
<p>I have no sympathy for those who never</p>
<p>Yield to the lure of its sweet tendernesses.’</p>
<p>What? Ought one choose to banish it forever?</p>
<p>Are the dead—freed so long from its caresses—</p>
<p>Happy to be so? Bah! I doubt it.</p>
<p>Passion is all. How can one live without it?</p>
<p>If nothingness is far the worst of states,</p>
<p>No nothingness I know annihilates</p>
<p>Life quite so much as lovelessness, I vow.</p>
<p>Woe to the cold, unloving heart!… Well now,</p>
<p>Zoon loved nothing, no one, not</p>
<p>Even himself. But one day, as he stood,</p>
<p>Stunned, before sleeping Iole, his lot</p>
<p>Changed in a trice. For Love, who would</p>
<p>Not make of him a lover, nonetheless</p>
<p>Made him a hero in this wilderness.</p>
<p>Grateful, he thanks the god who makes</p>
<p>Him tremble at the awesome sight</p>
<p>Of this young wonder. At length, she awakes,</p>
<p>Sees him, surprised, and, seized with fright,</p>
<p>Tries to flee, but the young man overtakes</p>
<p>And stops her, saying: ’O my soul’s delight!</p>
<p>O object rare! Why do you flee me?</p>
<p>Look upon me! Do you not see me</p>
<p>Changed by your beauty? No more now the wild</p>
<p>And savage creature I once was. Beguiled</p>
<p>Am I, charmed by your face and feature, whose</p>
<p>Power has worked to free me thus from my</p>
<p>Old way. I pray, dearest, you not refuse</p>
<p>To let me use my wealth to gratify</p>
<p>Your merest wish! It shall be done!’</p>
<p>Iole, ever more unstrung,will run,</p>
<p>Blushing, in silence, to the town; and, there,</p>
<p>Will apprize everyone of the affair</p>
<p>Miraculous. Whereupon, one by one,</p>
<p>They eagerly surround her. Soon Zoon</p>
<p>Arrives, triumphant. He draws near</p>
<p>As the whole company, with gladsome cheer,</p>
<p>Will bid him welcome… Sisters mine, I need</p>
<p>Not tell you in detail, how he</p>
<p>Lavishly feted the fair Iole.</p>
<p>Suffice to say their marriage was decreed</p>
<p>And forthwith celebrated. But the same</p>
<p>Day of the wedding, an intruder came—</p>
<p>A neighboring satrap—who swoops down,</p>
<p>Most unsuspected, on the town,</p>
<p>Seizes the bride to bear her off. But not</p>
<p>Successfully, for Zoon gives him chase,</p>
<p>Catches him and, in combat face to face,</p>
<p>Makes him yield up his gain ill got.</p>
<p>And, though the satrap is defeated,</p>
<p>Nonetheless is he by his rival treated</p>
<p>Most generously. That generosity,</p>
<p>However, serves him not; for, pining, he</p>
<p>Broods on the destiny that Fate has meted</p>
<p>Out: on that marriage that must seal his death.</p>
<p>The grave, that destination grim,</p>
<p>Refuge of the most woeful, welcomes him.</p>
<p>But just before he draws his final breath,</p>
<p>He names Iole as his heir. With moan</p>
<p>And groan she bathes his tomb with tears. What good</p>
<p>Does such lamenting once the soul has flown?</p>
<p>None! And the satrap should have understood</p>
<p>That love is oftentimes best left alone.”</p>
<p>Scarcely had the young Iris told her story</p>
<p>Than her two sisters, with air laudatory,</p>
<p>Admit that, for all that, love is the best</p>
<p>Pathway to glory. “Puffed up is one’s breast</p>
<p>With pride when one is loved, and when one sees</p>
<p>Oneself esteemed, with wordless subtleties</p>
<p>Of lips charmingly eloquent, though mute…”</p>
<p>So said the sisters three, still resolute,</p>
<p>Shunning the day’s festivities… But lo!</p>
<p>Just then a violent storm begins to blow</p>
<p>Gust upon gust… Alas! They shudder, all</p>
<p>A-tremble lest some punishment befall</p>
<p>For their profane resolve… Ah! Suddenly,</p>
<p>Bacchus himself appears. Followed is he</p>
<p>By all the lengthy and chaotic queue</p>
<p>Of such as form his godly retinue.</p>
<p>“Where are those sisters?” he will say. “Egregious</p>
<p>Sinners who ply their labors sacrilegious</p>
<p>On this, my day? Let Pallas, by the bye,</p>
<p>Come raise her aegis, brandish it on high</p>
<p>To save them from my anger! Try she may!</p>
<p>Nothing will spare them from my fury! Nay,</p>
<p>Nay! They shall feel the punishment I wreak</p>
<p>On those who tweak my prowess! Look!… I speak</p>
<p>The utter truth!” There, on the ground, one sees</p>
<p>Three wingèd, hirsute, black monstrosities,</p>
<p>Cowering… Sisters three? One seeks them, but</p>
<p>Finds not a trace. Their looms are smashed, and cut</p>
<p>To shreds their tapestries… There, in their stead,</p>
<p>Rises a shrine to the high-spirited</p>
<p>God by whose grace was nectar born. And she,</p>
<p>Pallas, laments; but ineffectually:</p>
<p>She can do nothing for her protégées.</p>
<p>When one god sees his votaries betray</p>
<p>His boons, his wrath is terrible. Nor might</p>
<p>Another deity put matters right.</p>
<p>This is the way in which Olympus tries</p>
<p>To keep the peace. Best we should do likewise:</p>
<p>Let us not labor on gods’ days, nor falter</p>
<p>To proffer our respect, altar to altar.</p>
<p>Days offered the immortal gods of heaven</p>
<p>Are never lost, nor ever vainly given.</p>
