CROW, THE GAZELLE, THE TORTOISE, AND THE RAT FOR MADAME DE LA
SABLIÈRE1</h4>
<p>I built a shrine for you in verses past,2</p>
<p>One that long as the world itself should last.</p>
<p>My hand had sought to set it, firm, to stand</p>
<p>Upon that art wrought by the gods’ command,</p>
<p>And in the name of the divinity</p>
<p>Whom one would worship there: fair goddess, she.</p>
<p>I should these words have graven on its portal:</p>
<p>“This palace is a shrine to the immortal</p>
<p>Iris.” (Not her, Juno’s handmaid indentured;</p>
<p>For she and Jove would willingly have ventured</p>
<p>To serve her, rather than she, them: it were</p>
<p>Their glory to bear messages for her!)</p>
<p>Beneath the dome, her heavenly elevation:</p>
<p>Olympus, with great pomp and celebration,</p>
<p>Seating her on a throne, by light surrounded.</p>
<p>The temple walls themselves, would have abounded</p>
<p>In scenes rich in her life’s fine deeds, with none</p>
<p>Of such as lead to strife, or peace undone.</p>
<p>And, deep within the temple I would place</p>
<p>The image of her beauty: winsome grace,</p>
<p>Her smile, her charms, sporting the art divine—</p>
<p>Endowed by nature, not her own design—</p>
<p>Of pleasing all who see her face, and who,</p>
<p>Head bowed, under their homage thereunto,</p>
<p>Lie at her feet before her soul’s noblesse;</p>
<p>Mortals, and heroes, demigods; and, yes,</p>
<p>Even the gods themselves, with incense strewing</p>
<p>Her altar. And I should have shown—though doing</p>
<p>With my imperfect art the task!—the rich</p>
<p>Treasures that shine forth from her eyes, and which,</p>
<p>For those she loves alone, are heaven-sent;</p>
<p>Her wit, her spirit, by the firmament</p>
<p>Bestowed. “Imperfect? Why?” Because her face’s</p>
<p>Beauty—its manly strength, womanly graces—</p>
<p>Shines far beyond the powers of pen to write,</p>
<p>However well and earnestly it might.</p>
<p>O Iris! You who every charm possess,</p>
<p>Who work each one on one and all no less;</p>
<p>You who, in wise unlimited, know how</p>
<p>To please, and whom one even loves, I vow,</p>
<p>As dearly as oneself… (But let that word—</p>
<p>“Love”—here pronounced, be not unseemly heard:</p>
<p>For it is one that, clearly, you prefer</p>
<p>To banish from your court; and I would err</p>
<p>Were I to dwell thereon.) And yet, I hope</p>
<p>You would allow my muse to limp and lope</p>
<p>In muddled manner here, and have, at last,</p>
<p>Its say. I add this preface but to cast</p>
<p>My fable’s subject in a gracious guise,</p>
<p>Portraying friendship as the worthiest prize.</p>
<p>Simple the tale I tell, one that with ease you</p>
<p>Will comprehend; I trust, too, that it please you.</p>
<p>No monarchs are the players here; no king</p>
<p>Who fails at love. The mortal shall I sing</p>
<p>Who risks his life to save his friend. I see</p>
<p>No fairer proof of one’s humanity.</p>
<p>And yet, four beasts joined in a bond of love</p>
<p>Shall herewith teach mankind the truth thereof.</p>
<p>A tortoise, a gazelle, a crow, a rat</p>
<p>Together shared each other’s company</p>
<p>In undisturbed tranquillity,</p>
<p>Having selected for their habitat</p>
<p>A corner quite unknown to Man, and never</p>
<p>Peopled by him. However, Man will find</p>
<p>Every retreat in time, whatever kind—</p>
<p>Beneath the sea, high in the air, wherever,</p>
<p>Or in the forests, where he lurks in wait.</p>
<p>(You four, I fear, will not avoid the fate</p>
<p>He has in store for you…) Gazelle went out,</p>
<p>One day, to frolic thereabout,</p>
<p>Innocent as you please, when, suddenly,</p>
<p>A hound—agent of Man’s barbarity</p>
<p>And his unmanly pleasure—found</p>
<p>Her tracks… Gave chase… The poor beast, with a bound,</p>
<p>Went fleeing… Back home, when the other three</p>
<p>Come round to dine, Rat, anxious, eyes</p>
<p>The company and questions in surprise:</p>
<p>“How comes it that we are but three? Where is</p>
<p>Gazelle? Has she forsaken us?”</p>
<p>Croaks Tortoise: “Ah! Were I adventurous,</p>
<p>And, like Crow, with those wings of his,</p>
<p>I would, this very minute, fly</p>
<p>Thither and yon to see if I</p>
<p>Could learn, at least, where she might be,</p>
<p>Or what eventuality—</p>
<p>Some accident, perhaps—has put</p>
<p>Our dear companion, fleet of foot,</p>
<p>Into some drear predicament.</p>
<p>For, surely, it could not be her intent</p>
<p>To leave us thus.” Crow will agree,</p>
<p>Fly off, and, in the distance, see</p>
<p>Gazelle, who, most imprudently, has been</p>
<p>Caught in a trap, struggling therein</p>
<p>To free herself. In zealous haste</p>
<p>He flies to tell the others. For, why waste</p>
<p>The time to ask her when? and how? and why?,</p>
<p>Like some tongue-wagging magister?3 No, I</p>
<p>Daresay he had more common sense! And so</p>
<p>Back he flies… Two decide that they should go</p>
<p>To where Gazelle lies captive. “Tortoise should,”</p>
<p>Says Crow, “remain behind on watch. She would</p>
<p>Arrive once friend Gazelle were dead!”</p>
<p>Despite what Crow has wisely said,</p>
<p>Tortoise sets out with them as well</p>
<p>To save the needy doe, cursing her lack</p>
<p>Of speed—poor stump-legged damosel!—</p>
<p>And the house that she bears upon her back.</p>
<p>Gnaw-stitch4 arriving—Rat had earned that name!—</p>
<p>Was quick to cut the knots that held</p>
<p>Gazelle. Imagine how they all exclaim</p>
<p>Their glee and joy unparalleled</p>
<p>At seeing her set free. But then</p>
<p>The hunter comes upon the trio, crying:</p>
<p>“Who stole my prey?” Gazelle bounds off again</p>
<p>Into the wood; Crow flutters, flying</p>
<p>Treetopwards; Rat goes scampering, finds a hole…</p>
<p>The hunter—poor, pathetic soul,</p>
<p>Half-mad—looks up and down; then, spying</p>
<p>Tortoise, controls himself, consoled: “At least</p>
<p>I have my luncheon!” Whence the clumsy beast</p>
<p>Is thrown into his sack. She would have paid</p>
<p>For all of them, had Crow not told Gazelle,</p>
<p>Who, quitting her retreat—bold, unafraid—</p>
<p>Pretends to limp; and limps so well</p>
<p>Before the hunter that he follows her,</p>
<p>Flinging his sack away lest it deter</p>
<p>His chase. At that, Gnaw-stitch attacked</p>
<p>With eager tooth; promptly unsacked</p>
<p>What was to be said hunter’s déjeuner.</p>
<p>Such is the fable as Pilpay5</p>
<p>Recounted it. Should I invoke Apollo,</p>
<p>I might, to please you, choose another way</p>
<p>To tell the tale. The same plot I would follow,</p>
<p>But longer—like The Odyssey</p>
<p>Or, say, The Iliad. Gnaw-stitch would be</p>
<p>The hero, though each beast would have a role.</p>
<p>The Princess of the Royal House—borne whole</p>
<p>Upon her shoulders!—would say thus and so,</p>
<p>Wherefore the diplomat—Messire du Crow—</p>
<p>Would play the spy and, later, act</p>
<p>As messenger… Gazelle? She would distract</p>
<p>The foe with cunning; thanks to which,</p>
<p>The stalwart Monseigneur Gnaw-stitch</p>
<p>Would have time for his derring-do. Now you</p>
<p>Might ask, with all the work each did thereto,</p>
<p>To which one would I give the prize?</p>
<p>The prize goes to the heart: there friendship lies.</p>
