KITE, THE KING, AND THE FOWLER FOR HIS SERENE HIGHNESS MONSEIGNEUR LE
PRINCE DE CONTI1</h4>
<p>The gods are kind and wish that kings might be</p>
<p>Kind and indulgent too. For such</p>
<p>Are their best virtues: finer, much,</p>
<p>Than pleasure of revenge. Your Majesty,</p>
<p>These are your feelings too. Well known it is</p>
<p>That, when wrath rises in your breast, it dies</p>
<p>No sooner born. In his heroic guise,</p>
<p>Even Achilles could not master his</p>
<p>As well; and more the hero you therefor.</p>
<p>Such is the name the boldest champions bore,</p>
<p>Like those who, in the Age of Gold,</p>
<p>Wrought noble deeds a hundredfold,</p>
<p>And here below earned men’s esteem the more.</p>
<p>Few are born great today. The universe</p>
<p>Is grateful for the ills the great not do.</p>
<p>Wretched though many are, they might be worse!</p>
<p>But let not such be models, sire, for you.</p>
<p>Temples will honor your largesse—</p>
<p>Your myriad noble acts; and when</p>
<p>The god Apollo—poet-citizen—</p>
<p>Plucks on his lyre, your name’s fair graciousness</p>
<p>Will fill his song, most honored among men.</p>
<p>The palace of the gods awaits you. Here,</p>
<p>A hundred years ought be your measure spent.2</p>
<p>The god of wedlock, too, would be content</p>
<p>To spend like number. May each year</p>
<p>Bring pleasure without end: the fair</p>
<p>Princess and you, most regal pair,</p>
<p>Deserve no less. Witness her charms and these</p>
<p>Wonders of yours: rich destiny’s</p>
<p>Gifts, qualities lavished upon you both;</p>
<p>Treasure unparalleled, that heaven bestowed</p>
<p>Upon your youthful wedded troth.</p>
<p>Her spirit, in the Bourbon mode,</p>
<p>Seasons her graces; and the gods confer</p>
<p>Both love’s and admiration’s boons on her.</p>
<p>But it is not my place to spread the word</p>
<p>About your joy thereof. Rather shall I</p>
<p>Write you a rhyme about a bird—</p>
<p>A kite it was—who, by and by,</p>
<p>Though many a year it had possessed,</p>
<p>Quite undisturbed, the selfsame nest,</p>
<p>Was by a fowler seized: a rare, much-prized</p>
<p>Prey; and, forsooth, the fowler meant it</p>
<p>To be a gift. (Mayhap you have surmised.)</p>
<p>For he intended to present it</p>
<p>Unto the king. And so he did, indeed.</p>
<p>The bird, thus proffered, will proceed,</p>
<p>Forthwith, with neither “hem” nor “haw”,</p>
<p>To grasp the royal nose with eager claw.</p>
<p>“His nose? The king’s? No!” Yes! It did!</p>
<p>“But how? Could not His Majesty forbid</p>
<p>Such arrogance? Had he no sceptre, no</p>
<p>Crown? Was it not malapropos?”</p>
<p>And if he had? No matter: nose for nose—</p>
<p>Commoner’s, king’s—no sooner the kite saw it,</p>
<p>Than it was meet for it to claw it.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the courtiers’ “ah’s” and “oh’s”</p>
<p>Arose with quite a clamor for the awe it</p>
<p>Inspired!… But futile would it be</p>
<p>To dwell on their chagrin. As for the king,</p>
<p>He stood by most impassively,</p>
<p>Because it were a fell, unseemly thing</p>
<p>For royalty to wail its woes; whereat</p>
<p>The kite clings fast, stands firmly pat.</p>
<p>Its master calls, shouts, lures… In vain. One might</p>
<p>Suppose, despite the hubbub, that our bird,</p>
<p>Arrogant-clawed, intends to spend the night</p>
<p>Clutching the sacred nostrils!… Soon it stirred—</p>
<p>But only when it chose—and quit its prey.</p>
<p>Says the king: “Let it go its kitely way.</p>
<p>And let go, too, the fowler, whose intent</p>
<p>Was but to honor me. No punishment</p>
<p>For either. Each one acted as he ought:</p>
<p>One, like a kite; the other, woodland-taught.</p>
<p>And I, too, like a king shall act.” The court</p>
<p>Delighted, praised his deed, though falling short,</p>
<p>Itself. (Few, even kings, would be</p>
<p>So well enlightened.) Thus the hunter, free,</p>
<p>Escaped. His only fault—and the kite’s too—</p>
<p>Was to have dared approach the lord and master.</p>
<p>None but a callous criticaster</p>
<p>Would blame these forest denizens… Should you</p>
<p>Wonder who told this tale, it was Pilpay,3</p>
<p>By Ganges shore, where never mortal, nay,</p>
<p>May approach beast and shed its blood. To do</p>
<p>As much invites disaster. Even kings</p>
<p>Dare not. “Can we be certain who</p>
<p>Each creature was in its past quickenings?</p>
<p>Perhaps that kite fought at the siege of Troy—</p>
<p>Prince? Hero?—paladin of hoi polloi?</p>
<p>And what he was he yet may be again.</p>
<p>Pythagoras has taught, and we believe,</p>
<p>That, men to beasts and beasts to men,</p>
<p>We change in form, and may receive</p>
<p>Many a body—pigeon’s, kite’s—before</p>
<p>We turn, in time, to human beings once more.”4</p>
<p>The hunter’s fate is told in yet another</p>
<p>Fable I know. Now let me tell that other.</p>
<p>A certain falconer captured a kite</p>
<p>(A deed most rare: a happening</p>
<p>Seen once each hundred years), and thought he might</p>
<p>Bestow the precious bird upon the king,</p>
<p>Mark of the nec plus ultra of his art.</p>
<p>And so he tries, with zealous heart,</p>
<p>To pierce the circle of the courtiers round</p>
<p>The monarch, sure that he has found</p>
<p>His path to fortune. But the beast, now belled,5</p>
<p>Seized at the hunter’s nose, and held</p>
<p>It fast, with savage talons steeled.</p>
<p>In pain the poor man shrieked and squealed.</p>
<p>The others laughed. King, everyone…</p>
<p>Who, after all, would not have done?</p>
<p>Myself, were I there too, I should not yield</p>
<p>My laughter for a kingdom! Now, perhaps</p>
<p>A pope would feel that laughing were a lapse</p>
<p>Of dignity; I cannot say for sure.</p>
<p>But for a king? I should think him a poor</p>
<p>Unfortunate dared he not chaff.</p>
<p>The gods immortal, Jove and all the rest,6</p>
<p>Chortled their fill, even when cares oppressed</p>
<p>And harried them. And when he went to quaff,</p>
<p>With his jovial eagerness,</p>
<p>The cup that Vulcan, halt of limb</p>
<p>And doddering, offered to him,</p>
<p>Ah, how he held his sides!… But I digress.</p>
<p>Be the gods as they may, it would appear</p>
<p>That I have changed my moral here.</p>
<p>And just as well. What could this hunter’s fate</p>
<p>Have taught about this foolish reprobate?</p>
<p>Besides, more witless falconers we see</p>
<p>Than generous, indulgent royalty.</p>
