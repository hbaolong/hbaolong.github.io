<h4 id="translators-preface">Translator’s Preface</h4>
<p>I am a self-confessed La Fontaine addict. Unlike other addictions,
this one is quite harmless. It even has an upside. My translations can
help introduce those with limited or no French to the genius of the
genial fabulist; and even, perhaps—though doubtful—improve the behavior
of a reader or two. (“Doubtful,” because, though I myself have
translated many hundreds of fables over the years, despite all their
edifying content I am still as flawed a human being as I was when I
began. And anyway, it is unlikely that La Fontaine’s intent for his
little moral tales was truly as didactic as his first six books would
have us believe. Their artistry far transcends their morality.)</p>
<p>But it has a definite downside too, by definition. La Fontaine’s
oeuvre, after all, like any author’s, is finite. When, in 1988, I
brought out my collection Fifty Fables of La Fontaine, even though I had
no conscious intention at the time of doing another, the possibility of
continuing to feed my happy addiction was always there. It surfaced with
Fifty More Fables in 1998; and again, with Once Again, La Fontaine, a
couple of years later. After each backsliding, though, I dutifully
resolved that I would reform.</p>
<p>So much for resolutions. I went on, in my all-too-human frailty, to
complete the remaining fourscore a couple of years ago, blithely
ignoring the fact that the supply would thereby dry up. (And, to the
best of my knowledge, there are no treatment centers to deal with La
Fontaine addiction.) There are, to be sure, other competent, attractive,
even thoroughly engaging French fable writers—scores and scores of them,
in fact, over the centuries. And I have dealt with many. But there is
only one La Fontaine. I can, of course, hope that researchers may
eventually discover a trove of as yet unknown La Fontaine fables. But
even that unlikely serendipity would be only a temporary solution at
best. And so my “collaboration” with him, while an ongoing joy, is
tempered by the knowledge that it now exists in retrospect and not in
anticipation. I am both enriched by the past and saddened by its
finality.</p>
<p>That confessed, what I present here is the integral fruit of that
benignly compelling collaboration with this dean of French fabulists:
translations—versions? re-creations?—of his complete Fables, in the
sweep of their twelve books extending over his entire literary life,
from 1668 to 1694; developing from the child-friendly and uncomplicated
minidramas of the earliest, through narratives of greater philosophical
and literary complexity—hardly children’s fare; and even unto the
lengthy but never ponderous works in the late books. Some of these
latter are not, in fact, “fables” at all, but rather contes—tales in the
style of his often licentious Contes et nouvelles en vers. But who am I
to argue? Included with the fables since their first publication (by
either La Fontaine or his publisher), they are traditionally part of the
corpus; and for the sake of truth in advertising I include them in the
announced completeness of the present collection. I hope readers will be
as undaunted by “Philemon and Baucis,” “The Daughters of Mineas,” and
the several others, as by “Maître Corbeau, sur un arbre perché …” and
his quite different ilk, which are much more readily committed to the
memory of generations of French school children. They will be rewarded
with a view of La Fontaine’s narrative talent that literary histories
often fail to mention but that shows many of the same qualities that
make him unique.</p>
<p>A few words are in order concerning my own philosophy as a
translator, especially of verse, and, more especially, of La Fontaine’s.
Without embarking on a screed-like discussion of the “rhyme-and-meter
versus free-verse” controversy between “formalists” and “literalists,”
which will never lose steam among Translation Studies adepts, I would
say only that for me—and individual taste is crucial here—to render
formal (i.e., rhymed and metered) verse into anything but similar
English is tantamount to artistic sacrilege. If the “message” is all the
reader wants, a prose (or prosy) rendition is fine. The Lambs’ Tales
from Shakespeare, I might point out hyperbolically, does serve a
valuable purpose, after all. But the message is only part of a poet’s
artifact. If he or she clothes it in rhymed and metered verse, to do
less is to betray at least part of its essence and to become the
proverbial translator-cum-traitor, all other things being equal.
Granted, no translation will ever “reproduce” the original exactly, but
why should it? That is not the translator’s purpose. What he or she aims
to do is to create a self-contained, self-standing work, one that has an
almost mystical connection with the original, but a work that,
ostensibly independent, transmits, to whatever degree it can, its music
as well as its message. Or, in the words of Seamus Heaney, “the tone” as
well as “the tune.” A translator tries to do this without sacrificing
either to the other. The product must be seamless, and, not calling
attention to itself except by choice, must sound as unforced and,
indeed, inevitable, as the text that spawned it.</p>
<p>In translating La Fontaine, the preceding observations are especially
pertinent. His free-and-easy vers libres (i.e., freeish, not free,
verse, in seventeenth-century usage), for all their liberty—their run-on
lines, their natural speech rhythms, their inner rhymes and melodic
repetitions—are no less set against an underlying metrical grid that
constrains and intensifies that freedom. To render them into a
rhymeless, meterless English would be rather like turning Shakespeare’s
blank verse iambics into French rhymed octosyllabic couplets, or Dante’s
terza rima into sprightly limericks. It’s safe to say that something
would be lost… La Fontaine’s vehicle is as much a part of his organic
whole as are his subjects and his style. He is always there, at the
reader’s elbow, watching, with a complicitous wink and nod, the reaction
to a bit of stylistic liberty, an unexpected archaism, an egregious
rhyme, a sudden change of meter or line length for dramatic impact.
Even, at times, the introduction of a one- or two-syllable word to
function as an entire line. To ignore such bits of (deceptively?)
casual-sounding inspiration would, for me at least, be unthinkable.</p>
<p>Now, this does not mean that I think the translator should try to
follow his form with a slavish fidelity. For La Fontaine, as for
generations of French versifiers before, during, and after, the standard
poetic line is the twelve-syllable alexandrine. But he is also generous
in adding to the mix a variety of decasyllables, octosyllables, and even
shorter lines, not to mention a spate of so-called impair
(uneven-numbered) lines. All for conscious (or perhaps even unconscious,
instinctive) effect. And all in an effort to maintain the naturalness of
prose in the formal but unobtrusive trappings of verse. In English
poetry, as Pope tells us, the twelve-syllable line is overlong and
heavy. Occasional use can be effective, as it is in Pope’s own
picturesquely sarcastic example: “that like a wounded snake drags its
slow length along…” But it makes more aesthetic sense to use its
canonical English equivalent, the iambic pentameter, and to mold it
flexibly into a convincing whole, with recourse to lines of other
lengths as the rhetorical and dramatic situation demands.</p>
<p>In other words, the reader who troubles to compare my individual
lines with La Fontaine’s will not usually find a one-for-one
correspondence. Such an aping of his line lengths, although perhaps a
virtuoso accomplishment, would be an artistically useless one, since,
except for a few set pieces in quatrains, he follows no recognizable
formal patterns himself. His prosodic freedom—like the freedom of the
natural universe in which his characters live their slices of life for
us—is, in fact, one of his hallmarks and one of his greatest charms.
Some translators (and readers) will disagree. So be it. Here I stand.
Others, with as much of a claim to credibility, stand elsewhere.</p>
<p>Let the reader decide…</p>
<p>My thanks to my many staunch friends and colleagues for assistance
both practical and aesthetic. Evelyn Singer Simha has, as ever, been
foremost among them, and exemplary in every regard, with her
usual—unusual!—generously proffered advice; and Caldwell Titcomb has
always been ready with valuable observations, linguistic and
historical.</p>
<p>Most of these translations were written in the comfort of Adams
House, Harvard University, where, thanks to the hospitality of its
co-masters, Doctors Judy and Sean Palfrey, and their assistant Victoria
Macy, I enjoy the position of writer-in-residence. Let it be said that
my friends on its dining hall staff have also played a very sustaining
and tasteful role.</p>
<p>My own university, Wesleyan, has likewise been most supportive with a
number of grants, especially one founded by my late colleague Professor
Joseph McMahon in memory of his parents. Such help has been invaluable,
as has the much appreciated interest of Tom Radko and Suzanna Tamminen
of the Wesleyan University Press. I am no less indebted to Sylvia and
Allan Kliman for their encouragement; to Michael Weidman, French Wall,
Todd Houle, and Glenn Carlson for their electronic know-how; to Rosalind
Eastaway and Linda Cummings for frequent secretarial help; and to a bevy
of research assistants—Sophie Hermann, Rachel Hoffman Bengtzen, and
Daniela Cammack—for their efficiency and good cheer.</p>
<p>I should like also to acknowledge that the idea of this complete
edition was the inspiration of Dr. Willis Regier, who, with his staff at
the University of Illinois Press—especially Cope Cumpston and Dawn
McIlvain—has been most cooperative and supportive. To each and all, my
gratitude, with a special word of appreciation to enthusiastic
fablephile Liz Dulany for getting the ball rolling in the first place.
And, of course, my thanks to colleague and frequent past collaborator
David Schorr, whose whimsical graphic talents provide such fitting
company for La Fontaine’s verbal art, as well as to John Hollander for
his appreciative and always appreciated insights.</p>
<p>Henri Regnier’s eleven-volume critical edition Oeuvres de J. de la
Fontaine (rev. ed. [Paris: Hachette, 1883–92]), replete with copious
annotations, has served as source of many of my notes. I have chosen to
prepare my versions from the French text of the Fables as presented by
Ferdinand Gohin in the Association Guillaume Budé’s two-volume edition,
Oeuvres complètes de La Fontaine (Paris: Société des Belles Lettres,
1934), which purports to be a faithful representation of the last
edition corrected by La Fontaine himself.</p>
<p>Publication of this book has been aided by a grant from the Thomas
and Catharine McMahon Fund of Wesleyan University, established through
the generosity of the late Joseph McMahon.</p>
