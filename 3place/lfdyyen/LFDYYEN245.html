<h4 id="the-matron-of-ephesus">THE MATRON OF EPHESUS</h4>
<p>If any tale1—well worn, banal—</p>
<p>Needs no retelling, it’s the one I shall</p>
<p>Herewith relate in my own wise.</p>
<p>“But why?” you ask. “Why re-create her,</p>
<p>That personage of more than one narrator:</p>
<p>The Matron that Petronius glorifies</p>
<p>And many an imitator, too, discusses?</p>
<p>What special grace can you give yours to vie,</p>
<p>Verily, with Petronius’s?”</p>
<p>Rather than face my critics in reply—</p>
<p>Task of duration infinite!—</p>
<p>Let me but try to see if I</p>
<p>Can spruce his famous Matron up a bit.</p>
<p>Long years gone by, in Ephesus,</p>
<p>There lived a woman, passing virtuous,</p>
<p>In wifely duty chaste beyond compare:</p>
<p>Pride of her sex, hailed far and wide. And thus</p>
<p>Came many a soul to see her there,</p>
<p>Eager to gaze upon a sight so rare.</p>
<p>Each mother wished such consort for her son;</p>
<p>Each man wished for a mate like such a one.</p>
<p>(Ancestress of the clan Prudenda,2 she</p>
<p>Gave rise to long posterity…)</p>
<p>Her husband loved her madly. But</p>
<p>He died—no need to say of what</p>
<p>(Frivolous piece of information!);</p>
<p>He died: let that suffice—and left</p>
<p>A will that would have brought much consolation</p>
<p>Could wealth console madame, now sore bereft</p>
<p>Of spouse so loving and so loved. But no,</p>
<p>Not such a widow, she: such as will crow</p>
<p>Their grief—hair torn and garments rent—</p>
<p>But who, beating their breast to loud lament,</p>
<p>Add up their riches as they weep their woe.</p>
<p>No, this one moaned and wailed and bellowed so,</p>
<p>That all grew much alarmed and much distressed.</p>
<p>(Though they assumed that, like the rest,</p>
<p>This widow, while sincere her lamentation,</p>
<p>Was not ungiven to exaggeration,</p>
<p>Just for the show.) And thus they did as best</p>
<p>They could to temper her chagrin,</p>
<p>Telling Her Widowhood it was a sin</p>
<p>To mourn beyond all proper measure. Yet</p>
<p>All they accomplished was to whet</p>
<p>The dire despair of our fair heroine,</p>
<p>And make her grieve, alas, the more;</p>
<p>Until, in time, the poor bereaved forswore</p>
<p>The light of day, loath to participate</p>
<p>In pleasure now denied her lifeless mate.</p>
<p>And so into his tomb went she, intent</p>
<p>There to remain and join the late</p>
<p>Lamented in his netherward descent.</p>
<p>With her there went a slave girl, much devoted—</p>
<p>Cradle-companion, close as close could be—</p>
<p>Thither to keep her mistress company</p>
<p>And die as well; though, be it noted,</p>
<p>This loving, loyal devotee</p>
<p>(“Devoted?” Rather “mad,” if you ask me!),</p>
<p>Exemplar of affection sisterly,</p>
<p>Had failed, I fear, to think the matter through.</p>
<p>But soon the servant comes to realize</p>
<p>What such a stay must needs expose her to.</p>
<p>At first she lets her mistress sigh her sighs</p>
<p>And groan her groans; then vainly tries</p>
<p>To make her mourn as other widows do,</p>
<p>In manner more conventional withal.</p>
<p>The Matron, though—obdurate, spurning all</p>
<p>The usual consolations—has one thought</p>
<p>And one alone: what means she ought</p>
<p>Employ to reach unto that dismal</p>
<p>Valley of death, domain abysmal.</p>
<p>Quickest, no doubt, would be the sword.</p>
<p>But she demurs; for she would longer feast</p>
<p>Her eyes upon the poor deceased—</p>
<p>Cold in his bier, and yet no less adored.</p>
<p>Such being, indeed, the only nourishment</p>
<p>The mausoleum offers her,</p>
<p>Madame decides that, to pursue monsieur,</p>
<p>Starvation is her best expedient:</p>
<p>Portal direct, through which to quit</p>
<p>This mortal coil and be well rid of it.</p>
<p>One day… Then two… And she had fed</p>
<p>On naught but her “alases” and “ah me’s”:</p>
<p>Long song of woe; duly dispirited,</p>
<p>Cursing the gods, Fate’s vagaries,</p>
<p>And all of life’s most grave inequities.</p>
<p>Now, hard by where monsieur lay dead,</p>
<p>A second corpse hung swinging in the breeze:</p>
<p>A proper blackguard, and for whom</p>
<p>Only the gibbet—no fine marble tomb—</p>
<p>Would stand to mark his infamous demise;</p>
<p>Left thus, so other thieves might cast their eyes</p>
<p>Thereon, and be thereby deterred.</p>
<p>A soldier, placed to guard this gallows-bird,</p>
<p>Well paid therefor, did so with anxious care.</p>
<p>For if, through his neglect—mayhap</p>
<p>The merest nod or briefest nap—</p>
<p>Brigands or friends or kin should dare</p>
<p>Come snatch the corpse, then must it be replaced</p>
<p>By him himself, and that posthaste!</p>
<p>(Punishment most severe, but one that would</p>
<p>Presumably best serve the common good.)</p>
<p>And so it happens that, indeed, that night</p>
<p>Said guard espies a beam of light</p>
<p>Slivering through the gloom. Great his surprise</p>
<p>As to the tomb he hies him; stops; hears cries</p>
<p>Rending the air… Inside he goes:</p>
<p>Astonished at the sight, he eyes</p>
<p>The grieving widow there, bawling her woes.</p>
<p>Many his “wherefore’s” and his “why’s”:</p>
<p>Why such? Why so?… But so distraught is she</p>
<p>That she ignores his queries, lets</p>
<p>The corpse, in mute soliloquy,</p>
<p>Account for her vociferous regrets</p>
<p>And her decision thus to be entombed.</p>
<p>Her slave adds more: “Madame and I are doomed</p>
<p>To starve with grief. For so we swore.” Whereat</p>
<p>The guard, distressed at their condition,</p>
<p>Discourses—though no gilt-tongued rhetorician—</p>
<p>On life (its meaning, and all that).</p>
<p>The wife gives ear, more willing by the minute;</p>
<p>Hears what he has to say, takes pleasure in it;</p>
<p>Begins to lose her firm resolve… Says he:</p>
<p>“Starve if you must. I’ll not entreat you.</p>
<p>But if you sit and watch me eat, you</p>
<p>Need die no less, I guarantee.</p>
<p>Pray let me fetch my supper.” They agree;</p>
<p>And off he goes, returning with his food.</p>
<p>As thus he supped and chomped and chewed,</p>
<p>The slave began to harbor much misgiving</p>
<p>About the cruel vicissitude</p>
<p>Of thus departing from amongst the living</p>
<p>To join monsieur in death. “Madame,” she said,</p>
<p>“The thought occurs to me that, were you dead</p>
<p>And were your husband yet alive, then surely</p>
<p>There’s little question, entre nous,</p>
<p>But that he’d not be quick to follow you.</p>
<p>Life is so short: why leave it prematurely?</p>
<p>At twenty years the grave can wait, no worry!</p>
<p>Long will it be our host: so why the hurry?</p>
<p>Me? Let me live till wrinkles fill my face!</p>
<p>What? Would you waste your beauty and your grace</p>
<p>Upon the dead? What pleasures can they give them,</p>
<p>Imprisoned in their chill embrace?</p>
<p>Better to let yourself outlive them—</p>
<p>These charms divine of yours—and not allow</p>
<p>The jealous bier too soon to claim them.” Now,</p>
<p>The compliments, of course, have their effect:</p>
<p>Madame is quickened, as you might expect,</p>
<p>To thoughts of beauty and, perforce, of love.</p>
<p>At length, the impish god thereof</p>
<p>Looses an arrow from his quiver at her,</p>
<p>And at the guard as well. The latter,</p>
<p>Pierced to the heart, is smitten utterly—</p>
<p>More deeply than, at first, is she.</p>
<p>The more she sobs, the more those teardrops flatter</p>
<p>The winsome face behind the weeping mask.</p>
<p>(Beauty that even many a husband would</p>
<p>Find worth the yoke of husbandhood!)</p>
<p>And so the soldier, warming to the task,</p>
<p>Proceeds to woo the widow, doing</p>
<p>Everything wooers do a-wooing,</p>
<p>Much to the pleasure of madame the wooed.</p>
<p>He does so well that, soon, she tastes his food;</p>
<p>So well, that he seems fitter, far, to have her</p>
<p>Than even the most fair and fit cadaver;</p>
<p>So well, that there, before her dear deceased,</p>
<p>Widow turns wife—or so to speak, at least.</p>
<p>But as they lie thus consummating, lo!</p>
<p>A brigand steals that other corpse—the one</p>
<p>Our groom forgets to guard… He’ll run… But no,</p>
<p>Too late, alack! The deed is done…</p>
<p>Back to the tomb, in panic, will he flee</p>
<p>To tell madame the fell catastrophe.</p>
<p>How can he save his skin? Aye, that’s the question!</p>
<p>For which the slave girl, full of sympathy,</p>
<p>Offers him an untoward suggestion:</p>
<p>“By madame’s leave, no one will know if we</p>
<p>Hang up our corpse to take your corpse’s place.”</p>
<p>Madame agrees… O woman! Fickle race!</p>
<p>Some fair; some plain of face and feature;</p>
<p>But faithful? Ah, would there were such a creature!</p>
<p>Prudes, be advised: vaunt not your strength of will</p>
<p>Though your intent be to resist temptation.</p>
<p>For, fare we well or fare we ill,</p>
<p>Strong, too, is man’s determination.</p>
<p>Witness our famous Matron, who—</p>
<p>Meaning the good Petronius no offense—</p>
<p>Did, I must say, what many a wife would do</p>
<p>Under the circumstances; and who, hence,</p>
<p>Deserves no exemplary mention.</p>
<p>Her folly? Vowing in her innocence,</p>
<p>To die entombed: absurd intention!</p>
<p>Nor need she have too long repented</p>
<p>Hanging her dear-departed late-lamented</p>
<p>To save her swain. For, as she would discover,</p>
<p>Better to have a living lover—</p>
<p>Even a varlet, poor and lowly bred—</p>
<p>Than all your kings and emperors, rich but dead.</p>
