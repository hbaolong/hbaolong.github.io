<h4 id="belphegor">BELPHEGOR</h4>
<p>Satan one day—monarch supreme of hell—</p>
<p>Decided to review his subjects all,</p>
<p>Of every stripe. Kings, princes great and small,</p>
<p>And even all the humble folk as well,</p>
<p>Shed copious tears, cried many and many a cry;</p>
<p>So many, in fact, that Satan wondered why,</p>
<p>And each soul passing by he questioned: “Who</p>
<p>Was it that did this shameful thing to you?</p>
<p>Who cast you thus into eternal life</p>
<p>Of flame infernal?” One would say: “My wife.”</p>
<p>Another one: “My husband.” Whereat, he</p>
<p>Declared, at length, in his consistory</p>
<p>Assembled, having heard the same reported</p>
<p>By one and all: “If what they say should be</p>
<p>The truth, and not dissembled or distorted,</p>
<p>All the more glory can we earn thereby.</p>
<p>It would behoove us but to verify it.</p>
<p>Therefore a demon shall be sent, one very</p>
<p>Prudent and wise, to be our emissary,</p>
<p>To judge the wedded state; indeed, to try it</p>
<p>Himself, not satisfied to view it merely</p>
<p>With but his eyes.” The black assembly clearly</p>
<p>Approved the judgment of the Prince—no “nay’s”—</p>
<p>And chose a demon, one whose wily ways,</p>
<p>All eyes and ears, were legion: Belphegor1</p>
<p>By name; a master of fine observation,</p>
<p>Who, slyly, would, with seer-like penetration,</p>
<p>Learn everything one sought to know, and more.</p>
<p>And, to defray the great expense therefor,</p>
<p>Letters of credit he provided, all</p>
<p>Payable on demand, should it befall—</p>
<p>Wherever in the nation he might chance</p>
<p>To be—lest he, in straitened circumstance</p>
<p>Should find himself withal. As for the rest—</p>
<p>All of the joys and woes of Man’s condition—</p>
<p>Would he experience as well: the best,</p>
<p>The worst. And if, perhaps, during his mission</p>
<p>(Which was to last ten years, not one day less),</p>
<p>He were the victim of some nastiness,</p>
<p>He could, by dint of artful trickery,</p>
<p>Save himself from whatever it might be,</p>
<p>But would in no wise die, or homeward wend</p>
<p>His way, until the mission’s very end.</p>
<p>So off he goes, across the space betwixt</p>
<p>Earth and eternal night: a passage fixed</p>
<p>By the gods in their wisdom; but that took</p>
<p>No time for such as him: a glance, a look,</p>
<p>And there he was, in Florence if you please!</p>
<p>Florence, the fabled home of Italy’s</p>
<p>Resplendent life; city where, he was sure,</p>
<p>Commerce would yield him a rich sinecure.</p>
<p>And so, amidst the splendid luxuries,</p>
<p>He settled down and settled in, secure</p>
<p>In the thought that for ten years he would be</p>
<p>A man of wealth—fine mansion, livery,</p>
<p>A life of ease, servants galore to wait</p>
<p>Upon him and to please his every whim.</p>
<p>Thus did he live, and, adding to his fame,</p>
<p>He assumed Roderigo as his name.</p>
<p>Florentines one and all considered him</p>
<p>With awe, and stood astounded as he led</p>
<p>A life of revelry. Table and bed</p>
<p>Witnessed the lavish multitudes around him—</p>
<p>The ones he bedded and the ones he fed—</p>
<p>Who came from everywhere, and ever found him</p>
<p>Eager to share his sumptuous wealth with them.</p>
<p>Some chose to use the well-worn stratagem</p>
<p>Of fulsome praise, paying vast sums to those</p>
<p>Who sang his virtues in their verse or prose—</p>
<p>Seconded by Apollo’s art, the master.</p>
<p>No other god was more expert, or faster</p>
<p>In his design: to wit, to flatter. Nor</p>
<p>Had devil ever been with honor more</p>
<p>Bedecked, nor more respected. As for love,</p>
<p>Before long all the arrows shot thereof</p>
<p>From Cupid’s bow aimed for his heart: no fair</p>
<p>Or beauteous dame or damosel was there</p>
<p>But, yearning, used the charms that she possessed</p>
<p>To make herself more loved than all the rest,</p>
<p>However timid she: for, even were</p>
<p>There one rebellious lass who might demur</p>
<p>A bit, the gifts that heaped his arms would soon</p>
<p>Suffice to make her gladly change her tune.</p>
<p>Yes, ever silver, gold, and precious gem</p>
<p>Have bought for men the very best of them!</p>
<p>And who will not admit that well-filled purse</p>
<p>Is the prime mover of the universe!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our special demon legatee’s</p>
<p>Reflections on the marriages he sees</p>
<p>Round and about, are jotted down with care</p>
<p>In diaries. But much difference is there</p>
<p>Amongst them: some, whose spouses lived contented,</p>
<p>Were almost bare, and he, ashamed, lamented</p>
<p>Their lack of solid fact; while others were</p>
<p>Teeming enough for any connoisseur.</p>
<p>With such extremes as these, our Belphegor</p>
<p>Deems it is fit that he tarry no more,</p>
<p>And that, to form a judgment consequential</p>
<p>And well informed, it is, indeed, essential</p>
<p>For him himself to marry… Now, there dwells</p>
<p>In Florence one of those fair-featured belles,</p>
<p>Well graced with shapeliness, noble no less,</p>
<p>Prideful, and even haughty to excess;</p>
<p>Not without reason; for her virtue was</p>
<p>Her lofty pride’s most true and worthy cause.</p>
<p>But with it all, no fortune—or, that is,</p>
<p>Next to none. Roderigo proffers his</p>
<p>Proposal, plies his suit, offers to wed</p>
<p>Signora Honesta, whose father said</p>
<p>That many a beau had sought his daughter’s hand,</p>
<p>But that, of all the erstwhile wooing band,</p>
<p>He thought he might, indeed, prefer him; but</p>
<p>That he would need time to decide. “Tut tut,”</p>
<p>Says Roderigo, “time we have aplenty.”</p>
<p>Wherewith, many a serenader sent he</p>
<p>Cooing beneath her window; many a ball,</p>
<p>And fete, and gift, and fancy folderol</p>
<p>Did he bestow; many a sumptuous dinner,</p>
<p>Playing the grand seigneur, to woo and win her.</p>
<p>Great the expense; but no complaint! And she,</p>
<p>At length, did him the honor of a “si”;</p>
<p>She would be his signora. But, before,</p>
<p>There was the contract, and the notary,</p>
<p>And all such-like details that Belphegor</p>
<p>Found odd indeed! “What? One buys, here below,</p>
<p>A wife the same way one buys a chateau?</p>
<p>Strange folk!” And he was right. Legalities—</p>
<p>Contracts, and suits, and cases—all of these</p>
<p>Have replaced simple faith, and in its stead</p>
<p>Let troubles through the door, unlimited.</p>
<p>The heart, not laws, makes marriage trouble-free.</p>
<p>Friends pardon friends their folly willingly;</p>
<p>Lovers find nothing wrong with one another;</p>
<p>But spouses, wed, cannot abide each other!</p>
<p>Duty annoys. Such is our nature. “Thus,</p>
<p>Is there no happy marriage?” one asks us.</p>
<p>Only one, if each spouse—staunch, resolute—</p>
<p>Suffers the other’s faults in silence, mute.</p>
<p>Enough philosophy! Now let me tell</p>
<p>What happened when the devil brought his belle</p>
<p>Home to his side and, by experience,</p>
<p>Learned for himself the doleful consequence</p>
<p>Of taking for a wife a demoness!</p>
<p>Arguments, fights, many a reasonless</p>
<p>Angry harangue she spouted! More than once</p>
<p>She woke the neighbors, who, more than once came</p>
<p>To find the causes. And she would proclaim:</p>
<p>“A paltry merchant! Bah! A silly dunce</p>
<p>Is what he should have married! Not a pure,</p>
<p>Virtuous, noble woman! One like me!</p>
<p>Too virtuous! Why, better it would be</p>
<p>Were I even to…” Now, who can assure</p>
<p>She never did? Indeed, prudes such as she</p>
<p>Gull and deceive us shamelessly… Our spouses</p>
<p>Were ever at each other, and their house’s</p>
<p>Peace was disturbed at every turn—so goes</p>
<p>The tale—by war of every sort: the clothes</p>
<p>She wore, the furnishings for every season—</p>
<p>Spring, summer—or the money that Signor</p>
<p>Gambled away… Well, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>Life with her was a hell, and Belphegor,</p>
<p>Poor devil, burned for his real hell, and its</p>
<p>Eternal flames’ infernal benefits.</p>
<p>To make things worse, our said demon-turned-man</p>
<p>Finds he has wed the whole Honesta clan;</p>
<p>Bearing the costs, now of one, now another—</p>
<p>Mother, then father; now buying a mate</p>
<p>For older sister, and, for younger brother,</p>
<p>A tutor… Have I mentioned that the state</p>
<p>Of his finances, ever lessening,</p>
<p>Was aggravated by one grievous thing—</p>
<p>Creature, that is? To wit, his chamberlain.</p>
<p>Chamberlain? What is that? The very bane</p>
<p>Of one’s existence; one who profits most</p>
<p>From any trouble that befalls his host,</p>
<p>Stirring the murky waters more and more,</p>
<p>And making them yet murkier than before.</p>
<p>This animal is such that, as his master</p>
<p>Watches his wealth decrease, his own will faster</p>
<p>And faster grow! And what estate Signor</p>
<p>Still calls his own—alas, a meager lot!—</p>
<p>Well might be purchased with his own ill-got</p>
<p>Richesse! (Whence, should the master, thus diminished,</p>
<p>Become, in turn, the chamberlain, he would</p>
<p>Likewise increase in wealth and worthihood</p>
<p>Until, when once the turnabout were finished,</p>
<p>And the scales had been thus redressed, each one</p>
<p>Could once again be as he had begun.)</p>
<p>Our hero’s only hope to fill his purse</p>
<p>Was now a certain traffic, one not very</p>
<p>Sure to improve his state pecuniary,</p>
<p>And which, in truth, sent him from bad to worse.</p>
<p>His agents, like most of the ones we know,</p>
<p>Deceived him; soon he lost a ship, and he</p>
<p>Saw his whole trade betrayed from sea to sea.</p>
<p>And thus he borrows. But, much to his woe,</p>
<p>His creditors, unpaid, force him to flee</p>
<p>Their hounding and their villainy. And so</p>
<p>Off to the country will he go, among</p>
<p>Good farmer folk, one of whom—Matteo</p>
<p>By name—offers him safety in the dung.</p>
<p>Mincing no words, our demon now consents</p>
<p>To tell him who he is, and what; laments</p>
<p>His double ill—his creditors and, worse</p>
<p>Still, his Signora, his vile, wifely curse.</p>
<p>One remedy alone he saw: that is,</p>
<p>To enter bodies now other than his,</p>
<p>Take refuge there, long as he could. Thus none</p>
<p>Would find him, and Signora would not be</p>
<p>Able to prattle, rattle endlessly</p>
<p>About her virtue! (Oh, how she had done</p>
<p>To death that subject!) And he said that he</p>
<p>Would leave the body were it Matteo’s</p>
<p>Command he do so, as a recompense</p>
<p>For his most kind protection; but that those</p>
<p>Leavings would be but three. And, to commence,</p>
<p>He chose an only child—a maid—wherein,</p>
<p>With broil and blare he lodged beneath the skin.</p>
<p>(What happened to his wondrous body, I</p>
<p>Have no idea: history makes no mention.)</p>
<p>Matteo earned a gross sum, by and by,</p>
<p>To lend the lass bedeviled his attention</p>
<p>And cleanse the flesh where Roderigo hid.</p>
<p>(In Naples, I recall…) And so he did.</p>
<p>Whence on to Rome, to occupy another</p>
<p>Body—another wench. As with the other,</p>
<p>Matteo earned a handsome sum to rout him</p>
<p>From her. And yet a third. (One thing about him:</p>
<p>All females, they! Doubtless you noticed!) Now,</p>
<p>The king of Naples has a daughter fair,</p>
<p>The honor of her sex, and, lodging there</p>
<p>(In her, that is), our Belphegor will vow</p>
<p>Never to leave, so safe now from his wife.</p>
<p>The city and the countryside are rife</p>
<p>With talk about a peasant conjuror</p>
<p>Of wondrous skill. They promise him a sum—</p>
<p>A hundred thousand crowns—if he will come</p>
<p>And cleanse her. But full three times Belphegor</p>
<p>Has done his bidding, as had been agreed.</p>
<p>Though covetous, he must decline, and answers:</p>
<p>“Poor sinner, I possess no necromancer’s</p>
<p>Conjuring craft, and know not how, indeed,</p>
<p>Heaven has let me, with no skill, succeed</p>
<p>In chasing from a body—two? or three?—</p>
<p>Some feeble devil, powerless as me.”</p>
<p>Resist he will; still they insist. With threat</p>
<p>To hang him high, till dead, if he should yet</p>
<p>Refuse to use his power by day’s end, thus</p>
<p>Cleansing the maiden of the scurrilous</p>
<p>Devil within her. Forced to do his best,</p>
<p>Feigning an art he never once possessed,</p>
<p>Now he prepares, as thither everyone,</p>
<p>From everywhere—each blessèd mother’s son</p>
<p>(And daughter too!)—comes running breathlessly,</p>
<p>Joining the Prince to watch as, in the list,</p>
<p>The demon faces the sham exorcist;</p>
<p>The latter all a-wince as, trembling, he</p>
<p>Gazes, on one side at the handsome fee—</p>
<p>The hundred thousand crowns—and at the noose</p>
<p>Hung from the gibbet on the other: “Ayyy!…”</p>
<p>The demon sneers and snickers at the ruse</p>
<p>His mischief has produced. With tearful sigh</p>
<p>Matteo pleads, entreats, weeps… But no use.</p>
<p>The more he begs him, wails, cajoles, implores,</p>
<p>The more his tears but stiffen Belphegor’s</p>
<p>Leering, laughing resolve. At length, done in,</p>
<p>Worn out, he must admit that he has been</p>
<p>Unfit and powerless, against the devil’s</p>
<p>Hellish design. And, as the latter revels</p>
<p>To see him seized and to the gallows taken,</p>
<p>Matteo, in a sweat, undone and shaken.</p>
<p>About to spout a long harangue, his lot</p>
<p>Inspires in him a plan. “Ah! Would you not,</p>
<p>For me,” he whispers, “kindly roll the drums?”</p>
<p>They do. At which, the loathsome demon questions:</p>
<p>“What is that?” Whence, following the suggestions</p>
<p>Proffered by dire necessity, “Here comes,”</p>
<p>Says he, “Signor’s Signora, looking for</p>
<p>The spouse that heaven gave her!” Belphegor</p>
<p>Decamps posthaste for hell’s deepest recesses;</p>
<p>Tells Satan of the many foul duresses</p>
<p>Encountered on his journey. “Marriage, sire,</p>
<p>Condemns those who contract it to the fire</p>
<p>As much as any state. Your power, grand</p>
<p>And great, subdues all of the marrying band,</p>
<p>Falling like rain in droplets, infinite—</p>
<p>Not as large snowflakes! Proof have I. To wit,</p>
<p>My own life did I use to study it,</p>
<p>Taking myself a wife. Not that the very</p>
<p>Practice is evil, mind you. In the past,</p>
<p>When we began, it was a salutary,</p>
<p>Prosperous state. But nothing good can last;</p>
<p>And, since corruption is the rule, there glistens</p>
<p>In your crown no gem finer!” Satan listens,</p>
<p>Believes him. And he reaps his due reward,</p>
<p>Although he has returned in an untoward</p>
<p>Manner, and premature. But then, what could</p>
<p>He do? It was perfectly understood</p>
<p>That, with a demon ready to confound him—</p>
<p>A harridan forever hanging round him,</p>
<p>Ever and always in the same sour key</p>
<p>Plying her tunes—better it was that he</p>
<p>Slip away unexpectedly. In hell</p>
<p>One changes key, at times, mercifully.</p>
<p>Poor Mankind’s punishment is far more fell,</p>
<p>I fear. And I would like to see, instead,</p>
<p>How long even a most complaisant saint</p>
<p>Could such a trial endure without complaint.</p>
<p>Even the patient Job would lose his head</p>
<p>Under her dread attacks! That being said,</p>
<p>What do you think I would infer therefrom?</p>
<p>First, that there is no woe more wearisome</p>
<p>Than changing one’s home to a prison cell.</p>
<p>Second, that if your stars and planets spell</p>
<p>The pleasures of a marriage in your life,</p>
<p>Take not a Dame Honesta for a wife:</p>
<p>No honest one is there this side of hell.</p>
