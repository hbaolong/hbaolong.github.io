<h4 id="appendix-ii-notes">Appendix, II NOTES</h4>
<p>For Monseigneur le Dauphin</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Dauphin (1661–1711), son of Louis XIV and Marie-Thérèse, was
six-and-a-half years old when La Fontaine dedicated to him the first six
books of his fables in 1668.</li>
</ol>
<p>BOOK I</p>
<p>The Frog Who Would Grow as Big as the Ox (I, 3)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>La Fontaine’s last line has become proverbial. As for the whole of
the final quatrain, a number of critics took him to task for
unnecessarily appending self-evident morals to many of his fables—a
point of view by no means universally shared. Jean-Jacques Rousseau
especially—no lover of La Fontaine’s moralizings—citing this fable,
observes in a well-known passage from Book Four of his pedagogical
treatise Émile (1762): “Si votre élève n’entend la fable qu’à l’aide de
l’explication, soyez sûr qu’il ne l’entendra pas même ainsi” (If your
pupil needs the explanation to understand the fable, be sure that he
will not understand it even so.)(ed. Michel Launay [Paris:
Garnier-Flammarion, 1966], p. 323). For the present fable, not to
mention all the rest, the reproach is unwarranted on literary grounds if
no other. At least one of the several Aesopic originals (Phaedrus, I)
begins with a similar explanatory moral: “Inops, potentem dum vult
imitari, perit…” (When the poor man wants to ape the powerful, he comes
to grief).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Man and His Image (I, 11)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The dedicatee is Monsieur le duc de La Rochefoucauld (1613–80),
whose pithy Maximes (1665) exemplify, in generally pessimistic tone, the
typical seventeenth-century desire to analyze Man, the social
animal.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Dragon with Many Heads and the Dragon with Many Tails (I,12)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The fabled, many-headed Hydra is a terrifying monster—some endow her
with three heads, others with seven, some even with nine, and each more
horrible than the other.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Thieves and the Ass (I, 13)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The name “maître Aliboron,” used here by La Fontaine to designate
the ass, has a lengthy history. Derived from the hellebore (in Latin,
elleborum), a powerful medicinal plant known since ancient times, the
name came to be commonly used by medieval and Renaissance French
writers—Rabelais among them—to indicate a pretentious charlatan. An
etymological connection with the name of the Arabian
mathematician-philosopher Al-Birouni has also been suggested. (See
Jaqueline Picoche, Nouveau Dictionnaire étymologique du français [Paris:
Hachette-Tchou, 1971], p. 18.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Simonides Saved by the Gods (I, 14)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>François de Malherbe (1555–1628) is remembered much more for his
theories and poetic reforms than for any of his generally unemotional
verse. It was he who attempted to regularize French versification,
preferring cerebral order to visceral inspiration.</p></li>
<li><p>Simonides was a Greek lyric poet of the sixth century
bce.</p></li>
<li><p>Twins born of Jupiter’s swan-disguised dalliance with Leda,
Castor and Pollux were inseparable in the many heroic feats lauded by
Simonides, for which they were eventually immortalized as the
constellation Gemini.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the nine Muses of Greek mythology, daughters of Zeus and
Mnemosyne (Memory), Melpomene claimed tragedy as her particular
bailiwick.</p></li>
<li><p>A more specialized divine residence than Mount Olympus, Mount
Parnassus was the fabled shrine of Apollo and the Muses. Its heights
have long been symbolic of artistic achievement.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Death and the Wretched Man andandandand Death and the Woodsman (I, 15
andandandand 16)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Maecenas, whose reflection La Fontaine cites below, and whom he
praises in the prose passage following the fable, was an important Roman
patron of letters during the reign of Augustus. Henri Regnier, in his
exhaustively annotated Oeuvres de J. de la Fontaine (rev. ed., 11 vols.
[Paris: Hachette, 1883–92], 1:103–6), indicates that La Fontaine
probably knew his lines of verse either as quoted in one of Seneca’s
Epistles or as referred to by Montaigne in his Essays (11, 37).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Cock and the Pearl (I, 20)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This fable is an example of La Fontaine’s occasional device of
turning the general to the concrete, in updated dress. The Aesopic model
(Phaedrus, III, 12), widely reworked throughout the Middle Ages and
beyond, makes no specific mention of manuscripts and booksellers. Other
examples in the present collection will be self-evident.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hornets and the Honeybees (I, 21)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Announcing his moral, as he sometimes does, at the beginning
rather than the end of his fable, La Fontaine cites a line from
Aristophanes’ comedy The Thesmophoriazusae (The Women at Demeter’s
Feast), of 411 bce.</p></li>
<li><p>I have avoided a literal translation, which would be lost in
English, of the French lécher l’ours (to lick the bear), a literary
allusion borrowed from Rabelais (Pantagruel, Book III, chapter 42) and
applied to unnecessarily long and drawn-out proceedings, legal and
otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>In La Fontaine’s time the arbitrariness, severity, and venality
of Turkish justice were a literary commonplace based largely on fact.
See Regnier, 1:122.</p></li>
<li><p>For a later fable that dramatizes this observation, see “The
Oyster and the Adversaries” (IX, 9).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BOOK II</p>
<p>Against Those with Too Difficult Tastes (II, 1)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Muse of lyric poetry, Calliope has, in later years, seen her
noble name given to the tooting steam-whistle instrument characteristic
of circuses and carnivals.</p></li>
<li><p>See note 1 for I, 14.</p></li>
<li><p>In lines 29–39 La Fontaine, with typical tongue-in-cheek
pomposity, uses the episode of the Trojan Horse in The Iliad to launch
an endless description with which his readers were already quite
familiar.</p></li>
<li><p>For La Fontaine’s celebrated version of “The Crow and the Fox,” a
fable existing since Aesop, see I, 2.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Rats in Council Assembled (II, 2)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>La Fontaine borrows the name of the cat, Rodilard(us)—Nibblelard
in my translation—from Rabelais (Pantagruel, Book IV, chapter
67).</p></li>
<li><p>The question forms the recurring line in the fourteenth-century
fabulist Eustache Deschamps’s treatment of the same fable in ballade
form. (See my collection The Fabulists French: Verse Fables of Nine
Centuries [Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1992], 10–11.)</p></li>
<li><p>For a list of some of the dozens of Oriental and Occidental
antecedents and adaptations of this popular tale, probably introduced to
the West by the Arabs in the thirteenth century, see Paul Franklin Baum,
“The Fable of Belling the Cat,” in Proverbia in Fabula: Essays on the
Relationship of the Proverb and the Fable (ed. Pack Carnes [Bern: Lang,
1988], 37–46).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Wolf Pleading against the Fox before the Ape (II, 3)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In classical mythology, Themis was the goddess of the Law, and
mother of the Fates. She is represented as sitting by Jove, with her
balances in hand, ready to offer him counsel.</p></li>
<li><p>La Fontaine’s note.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Bat and the Two Weasels (II, 5)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The reference in the last line is to the late sixteenth-century wars
of religion, in which the Sainte Ligue, originally founded to defend the
cause of Catholicism against the forces of Calvinism, later became
inimical to the kingdom by its alliance with Philip II of Spain. Only a
hypocrite, La Fontaine is saying, could bear allegiance to both. The
Ligue was eventually dissolved when Henri IV renounced the Calvinist
faith.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Eagle and the Dung Beetle (II, 8)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ganymede, a Trojan prince, was borne off by Zeus in the form of an
eagle, and became the cupbearer of the gods.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ass with a Load of Sponges and the Ass with a Load of Salt (II,
10)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>La Fontaine is no doubt referring here to the celebrated episode in
Rabelais (Pantagruel, Book IV, chapter 8), in which Panurge loses all
his sheep once he has lost the first.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Lion and the Rat andandandand The Dove and the Ant (II, 11
andandandand 12)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Generations of critics have noted that this concluding line seems
curiously out of place, introducing a second moral apparently unrelated
to the one announced in the opening quatrain and illustrated by both
fables. Regnier (2:163) explains it away as merely a typical passing
reflection, unconnected to what precedes or follows. But La Fontaine
does seem to be suggesting, albeit vaguely, that the virtues of patience
and hard work are, after all, ones that the small and weak are, by their
very nature, obliged to display. Without presuming to second-guess him,
or to contradict the learned Regnier, I offer a translation that, with a
minor liberty, assumes that to have been La Fontaine’s intent.</p></li>
<li><p>Antiquity’s association of the dove with Venus is recorded in a
number of works, among them Ovid’s Metamorphoses (XV, 386), where
“Cytherea’s dove” figures in a brief listing of those birds especially
dear to certain gods.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Hare and the Frogs (II, 14)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As occasionally happens, owing to La Fontaine’s somewhat capricious
punctuation, it is not clear if the moral here is spoken by the hare or
by the poet. I opt for the former.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Crow Who Wanted to Imitate the Eagle (II, 16)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Polyphemus, a Cyclops, is the villain of Book IX of The Odyssey and
later works of Homeric inspiration—and, perhaps not coincidentally, is
himself a shepherd. He is, in his many graphic representations, always
heavily bearded, a characteristic consistent with his persona in
Euripides’ satyr play Cyclops.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Will Explained by Aesop (II, 20)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The highest court in ancient Athens, the Areopagus was known for
its rigorous impartiality in even the most serious crimes.</p></li>
<li><p>Aesop was believed to have been a native of Phrygia. The
assumption is as impossible to prove as is his actual historical
existence.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BOOK III</p>
<p>The Miller, His Son, and the Ass (III, 1)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The fable is dedicated to La Fontaine’s friend, the poet François
de Maucroix (or, occasionally, Maucroy) (1619–1708).</p></li>
<li><p>The poet Honoré de Bueil, marquis de Racan (1589–1670), was one
of Malherbe’s disciples, author of his biographical Vie de Malherbe, and
an early member of the Académie Française. For Malherbe, see note 1 for
I, 14.</p></li>
<li><p>The reference is to a popular song of the period: “Adieu cruelle
Jeanne; / Si vous ne m’aimez pas, / Je monte sur mon âne / Pour galoper
au trépas.” / “Courez, ne bronchez pas, / Nicolas, / Surtout n’en
revenez pas.” (“Farewell cruel Jeanne; / If you do not love me, / I’ll
get on my ass / And gallop to my death.” / “Hurry, and don’t you
stumble, / Nicolas, / And above all don’t come back.”)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Limbs and the Stomach (III, 2)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This personification of the stomach, from the Greek gaster
(belly), which La Fontaine was to help popularize, is found in Rabelais
(Pantagruel, Book IV, chapter 57). Lest there be any doubt, La Fontaine,
in a rare note to his fable, specifies that it does, indeed, mean
l’estomach.</p></li>
<li><p>Menenius Agrippa, immortalized in Shakespeare’s Coriolanus, was
Roman consul in 503 bce. His apologue “The Limbs and the Stomach” was
intended to pacify the commoners and resulted in the appointment of two
tribunes from the plebeian ranks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Wolf Turned Shepherd (III, 3)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The name La Fontaine chooses—here and in many other fables—for his
hero (and antihero), is one of the many typically bucolic and pastoral
names common since the Middle Ages. This one is especially appropriate,
given the fictitious, allusive existence, in the sixteenth century, of
one Guillot le menteur (Guillot the liar). (See Edmond Huguet,
Dictionnaire de la langue française du seizième siècle, 4:411.)
Interesting too is the fact that La Fontaine considers the word he uses
to characterize his sham Guillot—sycophante—uncommon enough to require a
footnote, defining it as trompeur (deceiver). The word is, in fact,
attested at least as early as the preceding century.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Fox and the Goat (III, 5)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Punctuational imprecision in the original makes it unclear whether
this last line is spoken by the wolf or, characteristically, by the
moralizing La Fontaine. Both possibilities make equally good sense. I
have chosen the latter because it gives me the excuse to give two
proverbs for the price of one.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Drunkard and His Wife (III, 7)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Regnier (1:223) points out that, despite analogues as far back as
Aesop, this tale—really a conte rather than a fable—was thought by some
to be inspired by a true anecdote occurring between a lawyer and his
wife in the year 1550.</p></li>
<li><p>La Fontaine’s choice of Alecto rather than either of her sister
Furies of Greco-Roman mythology, besides probably being dictated by
exigencies of rhyme, was appropriate in that she, unlike Tisiphone (the
Avenger) and Megaera (the Disputatious), was the implacable member of
the trio.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Fox and the Grapes (III, 11)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Gascons in France are known for their bluster and braggadocio, and
Normans for their shrewdness, though neither quality is especially
evident in La Fontaine’s rendition of Aesop’s celebrated fox.</li>
</ol>
<p>Philomela and Procne (III, 15)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The reader familiar with Ovid’s Metamorphoses (VI, 412–676) will
recall the tale of the two sisters, Procne (or Progne) and Philomela,
turned into swallow and nightingale respectively, as a result of a nasty
family squabble with the mythical King Tereus of Thrace. When the king,
married to Procne, seduced her sister, he cut out the latter’s tongue to
keep her from telling; but Philomela cleverly revealed the news by
stitching it into her embroidery. To avenge Tereus’s infidelity, Procne
killed his son and served him up for supper. The king’s resulting rage
would have led to the two sisters’ deaths were it not for the gods, who
took pity on them, and turned them into birds. (Sources differ as to
which became the swallow and which the nightingale, though French
tradition generally identifies the latter with Philomela.) Tereus
himself was metamorphosed into the hawk, or, according to other
accounts, into the much less fearsome hoopoe.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Cat and an Old Rat (III, 18)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See note 1 for II, 2.</p></li>
<li><p>The mythological three-headed hound who stood guard over the
gates of Hades. His triple vigilance was lulled from time to time by
various means: a honey cake offered by Aeneas, the sweet strains of
Orpheus’s lute, et al.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BOOK IV</p>
<p>The Lion in Love (IV, 1)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mademoiselle de Sévigné was the daughter of Marie de
Rabotin-Chantal, marquise de Sévigné (1626–96). Not long after
publication of this fable, the young beauty married, becoming Mme de
Grignan, celebrated in literary history as the frequent recipient of her
mother’s letters, models of epistolary form and finesse.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Shepherd and the Sea (IV, 2)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The reader will appreciate La Fontaine’s intention in contrasting
the names Tircis and Corydon, on the one hand, with Pierrot, on the
other. The former, from many a classical eclogue and Renaissance
pastoral romance, bespeak a much more stylized and elegant simplicity
than the latter, the very essence of earthiness and banality.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Fly and the Ant (IV, 3)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This allusion, a translator’s nightmare, refers, as La Fontaine’s
fly rightly informs us, to that cosmetic meaning of the noun mouche.
Equally challenging is his punning reference, in line 40 of the
original, to the noun mouchard (squealer).</p></li>
<li><p>This ant of La Fontaine’s, staunch defender of the work ethic, is
obviously a close, but much more loquacious, relative of the famous
heroine of his first fable, “The Cricket and the Ant” (I, 1).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Gardener and His Lord (IV, 4)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>One can suppose a thinly veiled off-color suggestion on the part
of the seigneur, the escarcelle, in the original, being at the time a
little sack usually hung from the belt. (The reader should keep in mind
that the analogous French noun la bourse [purse], in the plural, has
also long been used to designate the scrotum.) Such—and more
pointed—liberties are the stuff of which many of La Fontaine’s Contes et
nouvelles en vers are made. (See my volume La Fontaine’s Bawdy: Of
Libertines, Louts, and Lechers [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1992], passim.)</p></li>
<li><p>If I wanted to justify my onomastic liberty and the arithmetical
exaggeration it entails, I could point out that, for the Romans, a large
portion of southern France was, indeed, known as Provincia.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The War between the Rats and the Weasels (IV, 6)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Assuming a translator’s license to indulge in name-play no less
than La Fontaine, I choose here the obviously medieval-sounding “Rat le
Bel”—a reference to the thirteenth-century king Philippe le Bel—and,
below (line 25), “the Ratovingian host,” to render, respectively, his
“Ratapon” and “le peuple Souriquois” of the originals, the latter a
conflation of souris (mouse) and the then celebrated Iroquois.</p></li>
<li><p>Meridarpax (bit-thief) and Psicarpax—or, more properly,
Psicharpax (crumb-thief)—are characters in the 303–line Greek mock-epic
Batrachomyomachia (“The Battle of the Frogs and the Mice”), long
attributed to Homer but most likely dating, anonymously, from the sixth
century. No character named Artarpax (bread-thief) actually appears in
the text, though others with similarly compounded names do. See Regnier,
1:287.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Ape and the Dolphin (IV, 7)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>La Fontaine’s comment reflects the high esteem in which the
literati of the Western world held Pliny the Elder’s first-century
Historia naturalis, from the Middle Ages through the end of the
seventeenth century. His prestige began to wane only with the advent of
more scientifically discriminating commentators.</p></li>
<li><p>According to legend, Arion, the Greek poet said to have
flourished at the court of Corinth some seven centuries before Christ,
was saved by a dolphin after jumping into the sea to escape from a band
of thieving sailors. The tale is told by Herodotus (I, 23, 24) and by
Pliny (IX, 8), among others. Arion is immortalized astronomically as a
constellation representing the dolphin and the lyre.</p></li>
<li><p>In La Fontaine’s day, this was a small village not yet
incorporated into the city limits of Paris. The name was commonly used
to suggest “the sticks,” as in “prendre Vaugirard pour Rome” (to think
Vaugirard is Rome). See Regnier, 1:293.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Camel and the Floating Sticks (IV, 10)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>My use of a single rhyme over three lines is not an oversight. La
Fontaine uses the same expedient in this poem, though not in the
corresponding lines. And for no apparent literary effect. He does the
same in several other fables.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Frog and the Rat (IV, 11)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>La Fontaine’s aphorism, with a typically chatty aside on the
archaic verb engeigner, was proverbial. As for the “Merlin” referred to,
not all commentators are in agreement. It is likely an allusion to the
popular sixteenth-century collection of prophecies and legends
anonymously attributed to King Arthur’s famous sorcerer. Some have taken
it to be an allusion to the work of the Italian macaronic poet Teofilo
Folengo, whose poem Baldus, first published in 1517 under the pseudonym
Merlin Coccaie (and then republished several times), supposedly was a
prototype for Rabelais. La Fontaine’s maxim in question is found both in
the former and in some versions of the latter. See Regnier,
1:306–8.</p></li>
<li><p>Although a lover of animals and a defender of their integrity
against the Cartesians, who thought of them as mere mindless
machines—his celebrated “Discourse [for Madame de la Sablière]” argues
the point eloquently (see IX, 20)—La Fontaine seems to be no zoologist,
classifying the frog as a fish. (The misconception does not occur in the
Aesopic original, drawn from the medieval Life of Aesop [see Regnier,
1:52], though I cannot state with certainty that it is not in any of the
subsequent versions of the same fable, with which La Fontaine may have
been acquainted.) More than likely, he is thinking theologically here
rather than zoologically, the frog being permissible fare on fast
days.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Old Man and His Sons (IV, 18)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Aesop. See note 2 for II, 20.</p></li>
<li><p>Phaedrus (ca. 15 bce–ca. 50 ce), a Roman slave freed by Augustus,
was a Latin poet whose imitations of Aesop served as a model for later
fabulists, La Fontaine among them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Miser Who Lost His Treasure (IV, 20)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The allusion is, of course, to the Cynic philosopher Diogenes
(ca. 412–323 bce), celebrated for his quest for “the honest man,” whose
contempt for his age led him to divest himself of all the comforts of
life and live in a tub.</p></li>
<li><p>The fable referred to is 225 in “Fabulae Graecae” of Ben Edwin
Perry, Aesopica (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1952; rpt., New
York: Arno Press, 1980), 409.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Master’s Eye (IV, 21)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Since some of my readers may be a little less familiar with
classical mythology than La Fontaine’s, I add to his mention of Ceres,
the Roman goddess of agriculture, provider of grain, like the Greek
Demeter, the appropriate adjective “fair,” often associated with
her.</p></li>
<li><p>The citation echoes the characteristically pithy moral of
Phaedrus’s fable “Cervus et Boves” (“The Stag and the Oxen”) (II, 8):
“Haec significat fabula / Dominum videre plurimum in rebus suis” (This
fable means / That a master sees to his own affairs best).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BOOK V</p>
<p>The Woodsman and Mercury (V, 1)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The initials are thought to refer to either Monsieur le chevalier
de Bouillon or Monsieur le comte de Brienne, the latter minor poet, a
good friend of La Fontaine, being considered the more likely.</p></li>
<li><p>See “The Frog Who Would Grow as Big as the Ox” (I, 3).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Little Fish and the Fisherman (V, 3)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The original “Un ‘tiens’ vaut mieux que deux ‘tu l’auras’” (a “you
have it” is better than two “you shall have it”) is a common and ancient
proverb. The context makes my translation more appropriate than the
usual English equivalent of “A bird in the hand is worth two in the
bush.”</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hare and His Ears (V, 4)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For details regarding the mental hospital known as Les
Petites-Maisons, founded in Paris in 1497, and whose name eventually
came to be used generically, see Regnier, 1:377.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Old Woman and the Two Servants (V, 6)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A thoroughgoing classicist, La Fontaine is, of course, alluding
to the three Fates: Clotho, who spun the thread of life; Lachesis, who
measured it out; and Atropos, who cut it.</p></li>
<li><p>The Greek mythological sea goddess Tethys is not to be confused
with Thetis, a later sea divinity and mother of Achilles. The confusion
is especially common in French, where the two names are
homonyms.</p></li>
<li><p>I am assuming, from La Fontaine’s context, that both meanings of
the English “spinster” are applicable to his characters.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Satyr and the Passerby (V, 7)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It probably bears mention that La Fontaine’s satyr, his many
offspring notwithstanding, is the mythological creature of that
name—half-man, half-goat—rather than simply an oversexed male.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hen with the Golden Eggs (V, 13)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Some Aesopic antecedents identify the bird in question as a goose,
more familiar to our ears than the present poule. (See no. 87 of the
“Fabulae Graecae,” in Perry, 355.) Others, like Babrius, 123, La
Fontaine’s probable model, refer to an ornis (bird), though the Greek
word often specifies the hen.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Snake and the File (V, 16)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>La Fontaine’s predecessors made the snake’s neighbor a locksmith.
(See, inter alia, my Fables from Old French: Aesop’s Beasts and Bumpkins
[Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1982], 112–13.) Perhaps
he changed serrurier to horloger to permit his biting allusion to “the
teeth of Time” (line 12). Or perhaps the allusion grew out of the
change. At any rate, for those more accustomed to the sound of
“locksmith,” “clocksmith” provides a serendipitous echo.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hare and the Partridge (V, 17)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Two of the three dogs’ names used here are discussed by Regnier,
(1:278, 417–18), who indicates that they imply the nicknames I have
given the animals (even if the poet doesn’t). Although the third,
Rustaut, goes unexplained—there would seem to be at least a suggestion
of “rusticity” in it—I take the liberty of characterizing him as “the
Wise,” given La Fontaine’s (sarcastic?) assurance of his infallibility
as one “qui n’a jamais menti” (who has never told a lie).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Eagle and the Owl (V, 18)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In Antiquity the owl was an emblem of the Roman goddess of wisdom
Minerva, counterpart of the Greek Athena, eventually becoming synbolic
of philosophy itself and the quest for knowledge. (Needless to say, its
strictly coincidental inquisitive-sounding “Hooo” has nothing to do with
the latter phenomenon.)</p></li>
<li><p>Given the scenario, I take the logical liberty of making La
Fontaine’s owl a female, despite the masculine gender of the noun
hibou.</p></li>
<li><p>The name Megaera has long been used in French to allude to a
shrewish female, as in La Mégère apprivoisée, the usual French
translation of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew. Hence my
translation of “voix de Mégère” (Megaera-voice).</p></li>
<li><p>I hardly need call to the reader’s attention that my pun is
gratuitous and does not exist in the original.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Lion Going off to War (V, 19)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Readers given to zoological precision will, I hope, excuse my
liberty here in transforming the hare into a rabbit, all the more
appropriate in the context, I think, since the latter is even less
ferocious than the former. Besides, La Fontaine too, on occasion,
sacrifices on the altar of easy rhyme.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bear and the Two Companions (V, 20)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The reference is to Rabelais’s celebrated sheep-merchant, in
Pantagruel (Book V, chapter 17), likewise done in, though in a different
manner.</p></li>
<li><p>Though it no doubt owes its popularity to La Fontaine, like many
others, the proverb “Il ne faut pas vendre la peau de l’ours avant de
l’avoir tué” (You mustn’t sell the bear’s skin before you kill him),
equivalent to “Don’t count your chickens before they’re hatched,” dates
from at least as far back as the fifteenth century. (See
Adrien-Jean-Victor Le Roux de Lincy, Le Livre des proverbes français, 2
vols. [Paris: Delahay, 1859], 2:191.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Ass Dressed in the Lion’s Skin (V, 21)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>La Fontaine’s irony here is obvious. He gives his peasant miller
a name—Martin—traditionally applied in French to the ass, as, for
example, in the proverb “Il y a (à la foire) plus d’un âne qui s’appelle
Martin,” usually translated as the less-than-common “There are more
jacks than one at the fair.” His irony is not original, however. It
should be remembered that the same name is given to the peasant in the
proverb “Faute d’un point Martin perdit son âne” (For lack of a stitch
Martin lost his ass; i.e., For want of a nail the shoe was
lost).</p></li>
<li><p>Readers familiar with the more common antique meaning of the noun
équipage (horse and carriage) may take issue with my translation here.
In La Fontaine’s lexicon, however, and that of many of his
contemporaries, it is frequently used to mean “attire,” as the present
context suggests.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BOOK VI</p>
<p>The Shepherd and the Lion andandandand The Lion and the Hunter (VI, 1
andandandand 2)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Some might be tempted to see here a bit of tongue-in-cheek
self-ridicule. Although no one would accuse his characteristic
digressions of being mere “empty ornament,” it is hard to take seriously
La Fontaine’s seeming defense of concision.</p></li>
<li><p>In a note of his own La Fontaine explains that the “certain
Greek” in question was “Gabrias.” It was by that deformed name that
those of early centuries, La Fontaine included, knew some of the
quatrains of the third-century Greek (or Hellenized Roman) poet Babrius
(also Babrios or Babrias), whose work was not more definitively brought
to light until the 1840s. For illuminating details, see Regnier’s note
to the present fable (6:3).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Phoebus and Boreas (VI, 3)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Unlike others who had treated—and would treat—this celebrated
subject of worldwide folkloric diffusion, La Fontaine chooses to use the
mythological names of his characters. (See, for example, the version by
sixteenth-century fabulist Philibert Guide, a.k.a. “Hegemon,” in The
Fabulists French: Verse Fables of Nine Centuries, 27.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ass and His Masters (VI, 11)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Purists may well prefer “currier” to “tanner,” the two not being
synonyms and the former being a more exact translation of the original’s
corroyeur. I prefer “tanner,” with no detriment to the meaning, since,
when read aloud, in many English dialects, the somewhat archaic
“currier” might not only be misunderstood but might be misconstrued as
“courier.”</p></li>
<li><p>As for any equally punctilious readers who may object to my
rhyming liberty here (“indict ’em / ad infinitum”), I urge them—invite
’em—to recall Jonathan Swift’s celebrated lines from On Poetry
(1733):</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So Nat’ralists observe, a Flea</p>
<p>Hath smaller fleas that on him prey;</p>
<p>And these have smaller fleas to bite ’em,</p>
<p>And so proceed, ad infinitum.</p>
<p>The Peasant and the Snake (VI, 13)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I choose to avoid the obvious problem of how to translate La
Fontaine’s designation of the snake here as an insecte, a literal
rendition of which would sound curious in English. The poet was neither
zoologically naive nor misinformed. He was, on the contrary, respecting
the etymology of the word (from the Latin insectum [cut into sections]),
commonly applied in the seventeenth century, according to Le Grand
Robert, to animals like worms, snakes, and the like, that, according to
popular belief, continued to live for a time after being cut in
two.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Wagoner Stuck in the Mud (VI, 18)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The town of Quimpercorentin (or Quimper-Corentin) was the county
seat of a district in Brittany. La Fontaine’s opprobrium, more than the
result of mere antiprovincial prejudice, would seem to have been shared
by many. See Regnier, 2:58–59.</p></li>
<li><p>As Regnier points out (2:60), the reference to Hercules is
slightly askew, since the god was asked by Atlas to replace him briefly
in holding up the heavens, not the earth. But La Fontaine’s mythological
intent is clear.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, the poet’s punctuational imprecision lets the reader of
the French guess whether his moral—one of many to become proverbial—is
pronounced by Hercules or by La Fontaine himself. For another example in
the present collection, see “The Hare and the Frogs” (II, 14).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Charlatan (VI, 19)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Acheron (River of Sorrows), in the original, was one of the
five rivers of the underworld in Greek mythology. I invoke translator’s
license here to allude instead to the better-known Styx. La Fontaine’s
reference suggests the death-defying tricks common to the outdoor
magicians and quack healers of the time, no less than to the
illusionists of our own.</p></li>
<li><p>Less elegant a coinage than La Fontaine’s passe-Cicéron
(Cicero-surpasser), mine attempts to echo at least his meaning and his
effect.</p></li>
<li><p>As Regnier observes (2:64–66), the soutane (cassock) of the
original was not exclusively a priestly garment in the seventeenth
century, as it is today, but was also used, as implied here, by lay
clerics and academics.</p></li>
<li><p>Arcadian mounts, both horses and asses, were, according to
Regnier (see 1:65), famous through antiquity.</p></li>
<li><p>Though la Mort (Death) is personified in the French as feminine,
because of the grammatical gender of the noun, I opt here for the
masculine pronoun, usual in English when referring to the Grim
Reaper.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Discord (VI, 20)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The reference is, of course, to the famous apple that Discord
offered to “the most beautiful” of the goddesses assembled at the
wedding feast of Thetis and Peleus. According to Greek legend, it was
Paris who awarded it to Venus, thereby incurring the wrath of Juno and
Minerva and precipitating their spiteful vengeance, resulting,
eventually, in the fall of Troy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>La Fontaine had begun his verse-novel Psyché, on the mythical
heroine’s amours with Cupid (i.e., Love), before writing his first
collection of Fables, completing it in 1669.</p></li>
<li><p>The identity of “Damon”—a common seventeenth-century pseudonym—is
unknown.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BOOK VII</p>
<p>For Madame de Montespan</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Tradition had it that Mercury gave Aesop, the “Sage” referred to,
the gift of the fable.</p></li>
<li><p>La Fontaine’s traditional pseudonym for the marquise properly (or
improperly) hyperbolizes her divine qualities.</p></li>
<li><p>This dedication of Book VII, conventionally fulsome but no less
disillusioning—one would like to think that La Fontaine was above such
toadying—was addressed to Françoise de Rochechouart de Mortemart,
marquise de Montespan (1640–1707), beautiful and influential mistress of
Louis XIV, with whom she had six children.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Animals Ill with the Plague (VII, 1)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Acheron (see note 1 for VI, 19) is mentioned by Milton in
Paradise Lost: “Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep” (IX, 578).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Man Who Married a Shrew (VII, 2)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>La Fontaine was not nearly as misogynistic as this introduction, and
preceding fables, would imply, having enjoyed a number of female
relationships, both platonic and romantic. His one marriage, however—to
sixteen-year-old Marie Héricart—appears to have been arranged with an
eye to her considerable dowry, and was marred almost from its beginning
by constant misunderstandings. It resulted in a legal separation in
1658, twenty or so years before the present fable was published, lasting
throughout the rest of his life. (La Fontaine’s amours, especially from
the time of his marriage on, have been sympathetically chronicled by
twentieth-century fabulist Franc-Nohain [pseudonym of Maurice Legrand],
in La Vie amoureuse de Jean de La Fontaine [Paris: Flammarion,
1928].)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Rat Who Withdrew from the World (VII, 3)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The alleged Eastern inspiration is probably a fiction invented by
La Fontaine to render the denouement more palatable. See Regnier,
2:106–7.</p></li>
<li><p>One is easily tempted to see here a pointed allusion to the
Solitaires of Port-Royal, the Jansenist religious community among whose
most celebrated adepts had been the philosopher Pascal. Their ascetic
discipline was clearly at odds with La Fontaine’s easygoing and almost
libertine lifestyle. He expressed this antagonism in works such as
“Ballade sur Escobar” (1664), in which he explicitly criticizes the
Jansenists for being spoilsports: “nous défendent en somme / Tous les
plaisirs que l’on goûte ici-bas” (forbid us, in short,/ All the
pleasures that one enjoys here below). His flirtation with various
projects of religious verse—among them the “Poème de la captivité de
Saint-Malc” (1673), done at the urging of certain Port-Royalists some
five years before publication of the present fable—without blunting the
temptation to read anti-Jansenist sentiments into the allusion, points,
rather, to La Fontaine’s typical vacillation between the values of flesh
and spirit, as well as to a good-natured willingness to lend his talents
to a variety of endeavors.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Heron andandandand The Damsel (VII, 4)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The reference is to Horace’s Satire about the city mouse and the
country mouse (II, 6, 79–117) which inspired La Fontaine as well. See
“The City Rat and the Country Rat” (I, 9).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Wishes (VII, 5)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Readers interested in the probable source of this tale, from the
Hebrew (and eventually, Indian) Parables of Sendebar, will find it
extensively discussed in the Regnier edition (2:119–22).</p></li>
<li><p>This fable is designated as number 6 of Book VII in those
collections where the pair of preceding fables, “Le Héron” and “La
Fille,” are presented each with a separate number rather than in tandem.
(The disparity is, of course, continued throughout the succeeding fables
of the same book.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>King Lion’s Court (VII, 6)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Regnier (2:130–31) devotes a lengthy and informative note to the
trained monkey known as Fagotin, who performed outside the theater of a
popular marionettist, Brioche, during the mid-seventeenth century. There
is some question as to whether the name may have, in fact, been used by
more than one performer.</p></li>
<li><p>One of La Fontaine’s lines in the original is most unusual in
that it has no rhyme at all, clearly a rare and inexplicable oversight
on his part, but one that gives heart to translators, who are,
themselves, human also. (I have been careful not to let my humanity show
through here, and have avoided reproducing La Fontaine’s error.) The
present lapsus calami is discussed in detail by Regnier
(2:131–32).</p></li>
<li><p>La Fontaine attributes to the Normans, known for their
shrewdness, the special art of evasive reply.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Vultures and the Pigeons (VII, 7)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The reference, as in “The Dove and the Ant,” is to the dove (see
note 2 for II, 11 andandandand 12). The dove is not only the sacred bird
of Venus, according to Ovid, but also, as he tells us in the
Metamorphoses (XIV, 597)—though without specifying the intermediary of a
chariot—a means of her divine locomotion.</p></li>
<li><p>The allusion to Prometheus’s optimism, in the face of his
persistent liver-plucking enemy’s seeming imminent demise, is too
obvious to require explanation. Readers who do not understand it will
find it amply elucidated in Aeschylus’s Prometheus Bound.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Coach and the Fly (VII, 8)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Obviously, I take the liberty of offering here an interpretation of
La Fontaine’s line that not everyone will agree with. It was the late
Professor Ted Morris who, years ago, first suggested to me (and other
then students) that, flies being flies and horses being horses, the only
appropriate payment for the hero(ine) of this fable would, indeed, be
the latters’ droppings. I’ve always thought he was right.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Milkmaid and the Milk Jug (VII, 9)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In Rabelais’s (Gargantua, Book I, chapter 33), Picrochole harbors
grandiose plans, like La Fontaine’s milkmaid, only to come to grief at
the hands of Gargantua. No lesser folly is displayed by Pyrrhus in
Boileau’s Epître I.</p></li>
<li><p>The Soufi (or Sophi) was formerly the title of the shah of
Persia.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Curé and the Corpse (VII, 10)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>La Fontaine takes the name Jean Chouart from Rabelais
(Pantagruel, Book II, chapter XXI).</p></li>
<li><p>If one can believe Mme de Sévigné in the letter to her daughter
dated February 26, 1672, La Fontaine’s subject here was a true event.
“Monsieur de Boufflers,” she relates, “killed a man after his death. He
was in his coffin, in the hearse, being transported to a league’s
distance from Boufflers for burial. His curé was by his side. The hearse
tips, and the coffin slits the poor curé’s throat.” Less than two weeks
later, on March 9, she sent her daughter the present fable dramatizing
the bizarre event, commenting that “the fable is pleasant, but it’s
nothing compared to the ones that will follow.” Apparently, she was
keeping abreast of La Fontaine’s creativity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Man Who Runs after Fortune and the Man Who Waits for Her in His
Bed (VII, 11)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>La Fontaine’s allusion to a cabbage planter turned pope is rather
obscure, according to Regnier (2:162), whose characteristically thorough
research would certainly have explained it if anyone’s could.</p></li>
<li><p>My high school English teacher, Julius Finn—a gentleman and a
gentle man—would be pleased to see that, years after he had tried to
convince me of the utility of the shall/will distinction, exigencies of
rhyme have convinced me that he was right.</p></li>
<li><p>The reference is to the pompous ceremonial levers (arisings) and
couchers (retirings) of Louis XIV attended by favored members of the
royal household and assorted dignitaries. The protocol of these events
is explained in detail in La Grande Encyclopédie (31 vols. [Paris: La
Société Anonyme de la Grande Encyclopédie, et al., 1886–1902], 13:29–30;
22:135).</p></li>
<li><p>Surat, north of Bombay, had been the first English foothold in
India, since 1612, and eventually became one of the richest and most
trafficked commercial centers in the Orient, visited especially by
pilgrims to Mecca.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Two Cocks (VII, 12)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Trojan river, the Xanthos, also known as the Scamander, would
figure in one of La Fontaine’s more cynical tales, “Le Fleuve
Scamandre,” in his Contes et nouvelles en vers. (See La Fontaine’s
Bawdy: Of Libertines, Louts, and Lechers, 252–59.) It was dubbed the
Xanthos (golden red) by Homer, for reasons variously hypothesized by
Pliny and others. As we are told in The Iliad, the gods referred to by
La Fontaine were Venus and Mars, wounded by Diomedes (V, 330ff.,
855ff.), and Mars, later struck down by Minerva (XXI, 385ff.).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ingratitude and Injustice of Men toward Fortune (VII, 13)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One of the three Fates, she cut the thread of life. See note 1 for
V, 6.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Fortune-tellers (VII, 14)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Though the basic subject of this fable is the ease with which one
can be duped by appearances, one must see it too as an evidence of the
tremendous vogue of occultism in the France of Louis XIV, part of a
wide-ranging superstitious belief in the other-worldly, and in man’s
ability to control it, by fair means or foul, reaching all the way to
the Salem witch trials. Charlatanism, fortune-telling, potions,
aphrodisiacs—all were the order of the day, as can be seen in a number
of celebrated affairs found even among the ranks of the aristocracy. The
most famous was perhaps the “Affaire des poisons,” which resulted in one
Catherine Deshayes Montvoisin (“La Voisin”) being burned at the stake in
1680 as a poisoner and a sorceress.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Cat, the Weasel, and the Little Rabbit (VII, 15)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>La Fontaine borrows the name for his venal cat cum judge from
Rabelais (Pantagruel, Book III, chapter 21), and the name
Grippeminaud—which I render as “His Grimalkinship”—from the same
author’s work (V, 11–15), in which the chat fourré (fur-bedecked cat) is
taken as emblematic of the hypocritical and pompous legal profession of

<p>An Animal in the Moon (VII, 17)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The two philosophers in question are, respectively, Democritus,
fifth century BCE, distrustful of the senses, and either Heraclitus
(576–480, bce) or possibly Democritus’s disciple Epicurus (241–70, bce),
for both of whom the senses were of paramount importance.</p></li>
<li><p>La Fontaine is referring here and in the following lines to a
poem by Samuel Butler (1612–80), “The Elephant in the Moon,” a satire
directed against the Royal Society of London. The manuscript was
probably known to him before its publication in 1676, thanks to various
of his English friends.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1675, Charles II of England did, in fact, try to mediate
between Louis XIV and the Dutch—in one of the Sun King’s endless
wars—although Parliament had forced him to end his alliance with the
French the preceding year. (It is historical references such as this,
not to mention the numerous philosophical allusions that pepper his
later fables, that draw La Fontaine farther and farther from the
category of “children’s poet” in which popular wisdom, well meaning but
ill—or only partially—informed, seems intent on forcing him to
remain.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BOOK VIII</p>
<p>The Cobbler and the Financier (VIII, 2)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>La Fontaine is apparently alluding to the Seven Sages of
Greece—Solon of Athens, Chilo of Sparta, Thales of Miletos, Bias of
Priene, Cleobulos of Lindos, Pittacos of Mitylene, and Periander of
Corinth—although I don’t know what specific classical text, if any,
suggests that their varied wisdom brought them much happiness.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Lion, the Wolf, and the Fox (VIII, 3)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Another allusion to the ceremonial bedtimes of Louis XIV. See note 3
for VII, 11.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Power of Fables (VIII, 4)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Paul de Barillon, French ambassador to England from 1677 to 1688,
was also a prominent social luminary.</p></li>
<li><p>The fabled, many-headed Hydra (see note 1 for I, 12) is taken by
La Fontaine as symbolic of the Triple Alliance of Spain, Holland, and
the Empire, aligned against Louis XIV.</p></li>
<li><p>The allusion to the hundred sheep is a sly jab at M. Barillon for
his well-known hearty appetite, bordering on gourmandise.</p></li>
<li><p>See note 5 for I, 14.</p></li>
<li><p>The orator referred to is the famous Athenian statesman,
Demosthenes (384–22, bce). His attempts to alert the Athenians to the
ambitions of Philip of Macedon fell on deaf ears.</p></li>
<li><p>Roman goddess of agriculture. See note 1 for IV, 21.</p></li>
<li><p>With a harangue similar to his Philippics, Demosthenes upbraids
the Athenians for ignoring Philip’s threat. It is conceivable, if
unlikely, that the reference was also intended as a veiled contemporary
allusion to Spanish king Philip IV’s anti-French adventure in the Thirty
Years’ War. By the time these lines were being written, however, that
adventure had soured, and he had, in 1659, already ceded Roussillon and
Artois to France.</p></li>
<li><p>“Peau d’âne” (“The Ass’s Skin”) is an ancient children’s tale. It
would eventually figure in the fairytale collection Contes de ma mère
l’oye (1694) of Charles Perrault. (Or of his seventeen-year-old son,
under whose name the tales were originally published: there is at least
some doubt as to which of the two was the actual author.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Women and Secrets (VIII, 6)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>French grammar being what it is, La Fontaine’s title “Les Femmes et
le Secret” can be understood in either a general or specific sense. I
think it is safe to assume that he intended the former.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Rat and the Oyster (VIII, 9)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See note 2 for V, 6.</p></li>
<li><p>I take the liberty (translator’s license?) of attributing to the
rat this reflection that La Fontaine omits; one that, under the
circumstances, seems warranted.</p></li>
<li><p>Many La Fontaine morals with a proverbial ring to them were, in
fact, like this one, introduced by him into the language. Others, while
predating his use, no doubt owe much of their currency to their
appearance in the Fables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Bear and the Garden-lover (VIII, 10)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>After Bellerophon, with the aid of his winged steed Pegasus, had
defeated the fire-breathing Chimera, he proceeded on to other successful
exploits. Eventually, when his arrogance prompted him to attempt to fly
to the heavens, Jupiter sent a gadfly to sting Pegasus and cast
Bellerophon back to earth. Lame and blind, he was condemned to wander,
aimless and alone. Milton refers to his fate in Book Seven of Paradise
Lost:</li>
</ol>
<p>Lest, from this flying steed unreined (as once</p>
<p>Bellerophon, though from a lower clime),</p>
<p>Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,</p>
<p>Erroneous there to wander and forlorn.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Flora and Pomona were the Roman goddesses of the garden; the
former, of its flowers, and the latter, of its fruits.</p></li>
<li><p>As he does elsewhere, La Fontaine repeats here the traditional
characterization of the Gascons as crafty and generally disreputable.
(See III, 11.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Two Friends (VIII, 11)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Monomotapa was a vast Kafir territory in southeastern Africa,
thought to be mythological by some, but attested, from the sixteenth
century on, by Portuguese and Dutch sources, and reaching as far
northward as beyond the Zambezi. It is extensively documented in the
nine volumes of translations from the Portuguese by G. M. Theal, Records
of South Eastern Africa (London, 1898–1903). Evidently, La Fontaine
chose it merely as an exotic example of a distant land.</p></li>
<li><p>The circumlocutory allusion to Morpheus, among many similar,
shows how willingly La Fontaine will use an exaggeratedly précieux
expression, rather than the simple verb “awaken,” with obviously
humorous intent.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Hog, the Goat, and the Sheep (VIII, 12)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Tabarin” was the pseudonym of a hugely popular Parisian mountebank
and huckster of the 1620s, who worked in collaboration with the
charlatan “Mondor”—also a pseudonym—selling unguents and potions on the
Pont Neuf and Place Dauphine. His blatantly physical and verbal humor
was a blend of medieval French farce tradition and the Italian commedia
dell’arte, whose practitioners had been established on the Parisian
theatrical scene since 1570. (See Oeuvres complètes de Tabarin, avec les
rencontres, fantaisies et coq-à-l’âne facétieux du baron de Grateland,
et divers opuscules publiés séparément sous le nom ou à propos de
Tabarin, ed. Gustave Aventin [Auguste Veinant], 2 vols. [Paris: P.
Jannet, 1858].) Tabarin’s real name, in all likelihood, was Antoine
Girard, though for a long time the man behind the mask was thought to be
one Jean Salomon. (See Georges Mongrédien, “Bibliographie tabarinique,”
in Bulletin du bibliophile, 1928, 358–68, 415–47.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Tircis and Amaranth (VIII, 13)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Gabrielle-Françoise de Sillery (1649–1732) was the niece of La
Rochefoucauld. See note 1 for I, 11. If we can believe La Fontaine, it
was she who objected to his semiabandonment of the brief fable in favor
of the lengthier—and sometimes very much lengthier—Contes et nouvelles
en vers, inspired, as he goes on to imply, by the likes of Boccaccio,
Marguerite de Navarre, Rabelais, et al. One may also assume that, still
of tender years, the young lady was not a little abashed by the often
scabrous nature of those tales, quite unlike the fables that had no
doubt peppered and enlivened her childhood. (For a selection, see La
Fontaine’s Bawdy: Of Libertines, Louts, and Lechers.)</p></li>
<li><p>See note 1 for IV, 2.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Lioness’s Funeral (VIII, 14)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>La Fontaine combines two references from Proverbs: 16:14 and
20:2.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Horoscope (VIII, 16)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Roman god Aesculapius, like his Greek counterpart Asklepios,
was the god of medicine. The son of Apollo, not content to heal the
sick, he offended Hades by resuscitating the dead, thus risking a severe
dearth of population in the underworld, for which he was punished by one
of Zeus’s thunderbolts.</p></li>
<li><p>I need hardly point out, at the risk of offending those who, even
today, believe firmly in the principles of astrology, that La Fontaine
would not be of their number. In this regard, see also “The Astrologer
Who Happens to Fall into a Well” (II, 13).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Ass and the Dog (VIII, 17)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>La Fontaine sarcastically refers to the ass as a roussin d’Arcadie
(Arcadian mount). See note 4 for VI, 19. Hence my honorific, no less
sarcastic.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Pasha and the Merchant (VIII, 18)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As the following lines explain, the Turk refuses to believe that the
merchant will do him in, thereby recalling Alexander the Great’s
confidence in his physician, accused of planning to poison him at
Darius’s behest. The episode is related in Plutarch’s Life of Alexander,
xix.</li>
</ol>
<p>Jupiter and the Thunderbolts (VIII, 20)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Greeks considered the three serpent-headed Furies (or Eumenides,
or Erinyes) such fearsome dispensers of vengeance that, as Bulfinch
relates, “Aeschylus, the tragic poet, having on one occasion represented
the Furies in a chorus of fifty performers, the terror of the spectators
was such that many fainted and were thrown into convulsions, and the
magistrates forbade a like presentation in the future.” (See Thomas
Bulfinch, The Age of Fable [Mineola, NY, Dover, 2000], 159–60.) See note
1 for V, 6.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Falcon and the Capon (VIII, 21)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Jean de Nivelle’s recalcitrant “dog,” product of a linguistic
misunderstanding, has been symbolic since the fifteenth century of
unwillingness to heed the call of duty. The historic Jean de Nivelle
(ca. 1422–77) refused the repeated orders of his father, Jean II de
Montmorency, to march against the duc de Bourgogne, thus earning for him
the opprobrious appellation “ce chien Jean de Nivelle” (that dog Jean de
Nivelle)! The popular expression invented a dog where there had been
none: “ressembler au chien de Jean (de) Nivelle.”</p></li>
<li><p>La Fontaine would more than once refer to the proverbial Norman
quality of shrewdness. For other examples see III, 11 and VII,
6.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Two Dogs and the Dead Ass (VIII, 25)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This fable is an excellent example of La Fontaine’s almost
improvisational development of a subject. The opening lines point us in
one direction, only to lead us, finally, to an utterly unexpected moral
conclusion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Democritus and the Abderitans (VIII, 26)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See note 1 for VII, 17.</p></li>
<li><p>Many sources attest to the reputation of the
Abderitans—inhabitants of the coastal city of Abdera, in Thrace—for
stupidity. (See, inter alia, any of the many editions of Brewer’s
Dictionary of Phrase and Fable.) Some, early environmentalists,
attributed it to the bad quality of the air. That notwithstanding, the
city produced a number of eminent philosophers, Democritus, “the
laughing philosopher,” one of the foremost among them. (Today he might
be diagnosed as manic, owing perhaps to the aforementioned insalubrious
vapors…)</p></li>
<li><p>In his typically charming offhand manner, La Fontaine is
referring, of course, to the popular Latin adage “Vox populi, vox Dei”
(The voice of the people is the voice of God).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BOOK I</p>
<p>XThe Faithless Trustee (IX, 1)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The allusion is to Mnemosyne and her daughters, the Muses (see note
4 for I, 14). One wonders if La Fontaine had in mind a sonnet from Les
Regrets of Pléiade poet Joachim Du Bellay (1522–60), which begins: “Nous
ne faisons la cour aux filles de Mémoire” (We pay no court to Memory’s
daughters).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ape and the Leopard (IX, 3)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>La Fontaine uses the names Gille and Bertrand several times for his
various monkeys. The former, possibly akin to the Old French gilain
(trickster), which personified fraud and deceit as early as the medieval
Roman de Renart, would later come to suggest simplicity, no doubt from
the name of the popular seventeenth-century clown Gilles le Niais
(Gilles the Simpleton). Bertrand, on the other hand, has no specific
connotations that I know of, though La Fontaine himself uses it in “The
Treasure-hoarder and the Ape” (XII, 3) with the ecclesiastical title
Dom. That being the case, and following the context here, I have taken
the minor liberty of doing likewise.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Schoolboy, the Pedant, and the Owner of a Garden (IX, 5)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Roman goddess of flowers. See note 2 for VIII, 10.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Sculptor and the Statue of Jupiter (IX, 6)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Although Pygmalion sculpted a statue of Galatea and not of Venus,
Ferdinand Gohin (2:141) suggests that the reference to Venus is to be
taken in the abstract: that is, a statue of sheer beauty. He points out
another possibility as well—that La Fontaine was perhaps confusing the
sculptor Pygmalion with a king of Tyre by the same name, who fell in
love with a statue of Venus.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Mouse Metamorphosed into a Maiden (IX, 7)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Many of La Fontaine’s fables, especially among the later ones,
were, in fact, inspired by the legendary Brahman fabulist Pilpay (or
Bidpay).</p></li>
<li><p>Few readers will have to be reminded that it was the abduction of
Menelaus’s queen, Helen—she of the thousand-ship-launching beauty—by
Paris, son of King Priam of Troy, that triggered the Trojan
War.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Oyster and the Adversaries (IX, 9)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I see fit to change the peasant’s name here, Perrin Dandin, to
one more common to Anglophone ears and more readily pronounceable by
Anglophone tongues. Suffice it to remind the reader that both Perrin and
Dandin are traditional names for typically naive rustics—ironic, under
the circumstances, given this one’s finesse—the latter immortalized in
Molière’s comedy Georges Dandin (1668).</p></li>

Regnier, 2:406.</p></li>

reputed to have possessed magical powers. According to one version of
his death, he flung himself into Mount Etna, which spewed forth a single

</ol>
<p>The Cat and the Fox (IX, 14)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Tartuffe, Molière’s celebrated comedy about a hypocritical
religious zealot, was controversial when it first appeared in 1664, some
fifteen years before publication of this fable, by which time the
character’s name had become proverbial.</p></li>
<li><p>Pierre Pathelin, the hero of the fifteenth-century farce bearing
his name, had long since become a traditional figure, the embodiment of
shrewd and self-serving, albeit eventually chastised,
deceitfulness.</p></li>
<li><p>See note 1 for V, 17.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Treasure and the Two Men (IX, 16)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is some disagreement regarding the origin of the proverbial
expression “loger le diable dans sa bourse” (to lodge the devil in one’s
purse) to indicate utter poverty. The tireless lexicographer Littré
accepted its attribution to the Renaissance poet Mellin de Saint-Gelais,
though casting some doubt by citing an Italian equivalent. (See his
four-volume Dictionnaire de la langue française [Paris: Hachette,
1881–82], under diable, 2:1146.) Another explanation suggests an origin
based on the fact that early coins were struck with an image of the
cross, obviously antithetical to the devil. (See P.-M. Quitard,
Dictionnaire étymologique, historique et anecdotique des proverbes et
des locutions proverbiales de la langue française [Paris: P. Bertrand,
1842], 309–10.) One way or the other, it is clear that, unlike several
of the proverbs in La Fontaine’s Fables, this one considerably antedates
his use.</p></li>
<li><p>After much translatorly soul searching I decided on the present
lines rather than my first choice, to wit:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>… and found</p>
<p>The treasure, object of his concupiscing,</p>
<p>Missing.</p>
<p>Although the verb “to concupisce” seems never to have been documented
(at least according to the OED), the attested adjective “concupiscible”
would, I think, have justified its use. That solution, however, struck
me, for all its virtues, as something of an overtranslation in light of
La Fontaine’s extreme simplicity, and I abandoned it, albeit
reluctantly.</p>
<p>The Monkey and the Cat (IX, 17)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>See note 1 for IX, 3.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Kite and the Nightingale (IX, 18)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See note 1 for III, 15.</p></li>
<li><p>Although often credited with having done so, La Fontaine did not
originate the pithy French proverb that concludes this fable. It is
found, a century earlier, in Rabelais (Pantagruel, Book IV, chapter 63),
and may well have predated even him. But the idea, at any rate, goes
back to antiquity. Plutarch mentions that Cato the Censor, addressing
the Roman citizenry in time of famine, assured them: “It is a hard thing
(my Lords of Rome) to bring the belly by persuasion to reason, that hath
no ears.” See Sir Thomas North’s 1579 translation of Plutarch’s Lives of
the Noble Grecians and Romans, 8 vols. [New York: The Limited Edition
Club, 1941], 3:179.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Discourse [for Madame de la Sablière] (IX, 20)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Marguerite Hessein (1640–93), the wife of Antoine de la Sablière,
was a woman of great learning, and was host to many of the intellectuals
and artists of her day, La Fontaine among them. His celebrated
“Discourse” reflects both her and his considerations on the intelligence
of animals. In it he attempts to refute the Cartesian assumption that
animals are mere machines. For him, while they may lack souls—a
concession to the religious authorities?—they are clearly not unthinking
automata, as his several examples dramatically show.</p></li>
<li><p>Iris was La Fontaine’s pet name for his erudite friend, perhaps
in reference to the several colorful qualities of the mythological
goddess of the rainbow.</p></li>
<li><p>Roman goddess of flowers. See note 2 for VIII, 10.</p></li>
<li><p>La Fontaine here expresses succinctly the famous cogito of
Descartes: “I think, therefore I am.” Early philosophers, lacking
today’s epistemological sophistication, assumed that one has to exist in
order to think about one’s existence.</p></li>
<li><p>The northern land in question would seem to be Ukraine, described
by Guillaume le Vasseur de Beauplan in his Description d’Ukranie (Rouen,
1560; Paris, 1561).</p></li>
<li><p>Jan Sobieski, chosen king of Poland in 1674, was a friend of
Madame de la Sablière and frequenter of Parisian salons, where he no
doubt recounted the impressive anecdote that follows. It was he who
delivered Vienna from the Turks in 1684.</p></li>
<li><p>See note 1 for VI, 19.</p></li>
<li><p>Gohin (2:349) discusses in detail the origin of this fable within
a fable.</p></li>

<p>BOOK</p>
<p>XThe Man and the Snake (X, 1)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Roman goddess of agriculture. See note 1 for IV, 21.</p></li>
<li><p>La Fontaine’s somewhat convoluted musing—attributable to the ox’s
style, as ponderous as his person—seems to suggest that here, as in “The
Coach and the Fly” (VII, 8), we are dealing with a quadruped’s only
concrete form of remuneration. In a “manure” of speaking…</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Turtle and the Two Ducks (X, 2)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If readers of the original wonder how each of La Fontaine’s ducks
(canards) could suddenly be transformed into a gosling (oison), they
should be aware that others too have asked the same question. For the
venerable lexicographer Littré, the poet was guilty of “une inexactitude
de langage, malgré la parenté de l’oie et du canard” (an imprecision of
language despite the kinship of the goose and the duck). (See the entry
on oison in Littré, 3:815.) Be that as it may, I have taken the liberty
of not following La Fontaine in his pardonable “inexactitude.”</li>
</ol>
<p>The Money-burier and His Friend (X, 4)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The French enfouisseur (burier) of the original is, to say the
least, an uncommon noun, and was equally so in La Fontaine’s time.
Dictionaries that include it at all usually cite the present fable to
authenticate it. That being the case, I have taken a minor liberty with
my English version of the title, since the simple “The Burier and His
Friend” would hardly denote what the poet intended.</p></li>
<li><p>This passage, with its indisputable but self-evident digression,
is not one of the many studied in a curious little volume of
economics-related passages culled from the Fables. But the many that are
discussed show to what extent La Fontaine was, at least superficially,
concerned with monetary matters. (See Gustave Boissonade, La Fontaine
économiste [Paris: Guillaumin, 1872].) For a more telling example, see
“The Value of Knowledge,” VIII, 19.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Spider and the Swallow (X, 6)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The enmity referred to is related in Ovid’s Metamorphoses (VI,
1–145), where the young woman Arachne, expert in embroidery, was
transformed into a spider after killing herself in despair over the
wrath of Minerva, her rival in the art. As for the allusions to Progne
(or Procne) and, below, Philomela, see the fable “Philomela and Procne,”
III, 15.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Dog Who Had His Ears Cut Short (X, 8)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The original cites the proverbial “Chien hargneux a toujours
l’oreille déchirée” (A growling dog always has a ragged ear).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Fishes and the Shepherd Who Plays the Flute (X, 10)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>La Fontaine chooses the traditional pastoral name Tircis for his
hero, and—his title inexplicably to the contrary—has him playing a
likewise traditional musette (bagpipe). I follow him in this curious
contradiction.</p></li>
<li><p>My pun on the verb to serve is not wholly gratuitous, the
original traiter suggesting, at least obliquely, a culinary
meaning.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Lioness and the She-bear (X, 12)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hecuba’s name has long been synonymous with overwhelming suffering.
Wife of the Trojan king Priam, she was victim of numerous horrendous
misfortunes after the fall of Troy, as portrayed by Euripides and other
classical authors. Not the least, and the one to which La Fontaine is
obviously referring, was the loss of most of her nineteen children;
among them Paris, Troilus, Hector, Cassandra, and Polydorus.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Two Adventurers and the Wondrous Writ (X, 13)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The French refers to the friend as having a nosebleed. For
readers tempted to compare the translation with La Fontaine, it should
be pointed out that nose-bleeds, in his time, were symptomatic of fear.
“To have a nosebleed” often meant no more than “to be afraid.” See
Gohin, 2:356.</p></li>
<li><p>The allusion is to Sixtus V, pope from 1585 to 1590. Legend has
it that, before his election at age sixty-five, he pretended—for some no
doubt political reason—to be a virtual invalid, always dragging himself
about on crutches, which he threw away once raised to the
papacy.</p></li>
<li><p>My wordplay here is not atypical of La Fontaine, and I commit it
with the caveat that the reader who might wince at it should not look
for it in the original.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>For La Rochefoucauld, see note 1 for I, 11.</p></li>
<li><p>It is hard to reconcile this scenario of the poet shooting
indiscriminately at rabbits from his perch on high with his obvious and
often-stated love of animals. Perhaps we are meant to understand that he
doesn’t really aim to kill any, but only frighten them to prove a point.
One would like to think so.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Merchant, the Aristocrat, the Shepherd, and the Prince (X,
15)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>See La Fontaine’s note at the end of the fable. To La Fontaine’s
note we might add that Belisarius (ca. 494–565) was a Byzantine general,
conqueror of the Vandals and Ostrogoths. He drove the former out of much
of North Africa and the latter out of Italy. His “master” in question
was the emperor Justinian I.</li>

<li><p>La Fontaine did, in fact, father a son with his child-bride, from
whom he separated shortly after. See note 1 for VII, 2. His
antiprogeny—self-defensive?—parenthesis is accurate, however. Fatherhood
was not his strong suit.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Dream of the Man from the Mogol Land (XI, 4)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>La Fontaine, certainly sophisticated enough not to confuse Mogol
with Greco-Roman theology of the afterlife, is no doubt using the
“Elysian Fields” here as a very general, nonspecific reference.</p></li>
<li><p>This apparent acceptance of the notion that the stars influence
human life is curious in light of La Fontaine’s outspoken mockery of
astrology in the fable “The Astrologer Who Happens to Fall into a Well”
(II, 13). Even his great admirer, the eighteenth-century moralist
Chamfort, called attention to the contradiction. See Regnier,
3:119–20.</p></li>
<li><p>I take the liberty of specifying the Parque (Fate) referred to in
La Fontaine’s allusion, since, from the context, it is clear that he is
speaking of Clotho, the member of the trio who did the actual spinning
of the thread of life. See note 1 for V, 6.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Lion, the Ape, and the Two Asses (XI, 5)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Michel Lambert (1610–96), son-in-law of Lully and a renowned
musician, began his long life at court as a page in the chapel of Gaston
d’Orléans, brother of Louis XIII. Eventually singing and dancing in
court ballets, he crowned his career as music master in the court of
Louis XIV from 1661 until his death, and was much admired as a singing
teacher and composer. Some three hundred of his airs are still
extant.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Wolf and the Fox (XI, 6)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As Ovid recounts in the Metamorphoses (I, 588ff.), Io, daughter of
Inachos, first king of Argos, was turned into a heifer by Jupiter—who
had, not uncharacteristically, taken a fancy to her—in order to save her
from the jealous wrath of Juno.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Peasant from the Danube (XI, 7)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See “The Cockerel, the Cat, and the Little Mouse” (VI,
5).</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding the legendary ugliness of Aesop and Socrates, as well
as that of the Danube peasant, subject of this fable, see Gohin,
2:362–63.</p></li>
<li><p>Marcus Aurelius (121–80) was Roman emperor (161–80) and author of
Meditations. It is generally assumed that La Fontaine found the
attribution to Marcus Aurelius of the story of the monstrous
Danubian—with more sense than the cultivated Romans—in François
Cassandre’s Parallèles historiques (1676). (See Gohin, 2:361–62.) The
sympathetic portrayal by Tacitus of the Germanic barbarians conquered by
the emperor-philosopher would also seem to have fed into La Fontaine’s
scenario.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Old Man and the Three Young Men (XI, 8)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This curiously self-referential conclusion was much admired by
Chamfort, who saw it as a rare example of the aging La Fontaine’s
artistic self-effacement before impending death. La Fontaine, more
concerned with the message than with the medium, passes himself off not
as the author of the tale but merely the transcriber of the old man’s
memorial inscription. See Regnier, 3:159–60. Regarding that inscription,
we must be willing to suspend disbelief: given the length of the story,
the cenotaph on which it was supposedly engraved would have to be rather
large. To be sure, La Fontaine’s source (Abstemius, 167: “De viro
decrepito arbores inserente”) is somewhat shorter, thanks both to the
pithy terseness of Latin and to the fact that, in that version, there is
only one man instead of three.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Mice and the Screech Owl (XI, 9)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See note 1 for V, 6.</p></li>
<li><p>See the lengthy “Discourse [for Madame de la Sablière]” (IX,
20).</p></li>
<li><p>Like the prose passage between the fables “Death and the Wretched
Man” and “Death and the Woodsman” (I, 15 andandandand 16), La Fontaine
appends this explanation to his fable. I keep it in the position to
which he himself assigned it, rather than relegating it to a note. As
for his perhaps naive assurance of veracity, there is, to be sure,
considerable question. See Regnier, 3:161.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Epilogue (XI, 10)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>At the time of writing, Louis XIV had imposed the Treaties of
Nijmegen (1878–79) on Spain, Holland, and the Empire, restoring all
territories taken from Holland during the Dutch War of 1672–78, and
causing France and Spain to exchange considerable lands.</li>
</ol>
<p>BOOK XII</p>
<p>The Companions of Ulysses (XII, 1)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Louis de France (1682–1712), grandson of Louis XIV, son of the
Grand Dauphin (to whom the first six books of the Fables had been
dedicated), bore the title duc de Bourgogne. Eleven years old at the
time, he was said to be especially precocious and intelligent, and was
tutored by the philosopher Fénelon. He would eventually be the father of
Louis XV.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite his protestations of waning abilities, and illnesses that
had prompted him to make (sincere?) amends to the Church for his rather
licentious Contes, La Fontaine was still quite in command of his
artistic talents, his seventy-three years notwithstanding.</p></li>
<li><p>In October and November of 1688 Louis XIV’s army, commanded by
the Dauphin, had conquered a number of fortified positions in the
Rhineland.</p></li>
<li><p>The enchantress-goddess Circe’s set-to with Ulysses and his men
is related by Homer in The Odyssey, X, 234.</p></li>
<li><p>La Fontaine is whimsically recalling the Latin talpa (mole),
traditionally cited by ancient grammars as an example of a noun of
either masculine or feminine gender.</p></li>
<li><p>The poison referred to is, of course, metaphorical; to wit, the
passion of love.</p></li>

<p>The Cat and the Two Sparrows (XII, 2)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>See note 1 for XII, 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Treasure-hoarder and the Ape (XII, 3)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Bertrand, with and without the honorific “Dom” appended, is one of
the two common names La Fontaine uses for his several simians, the other
being Gille. For probable origins and the fable in which he uses both,
see “The Ape and the Leopard” (IX, 3) and note 1 for that fable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Two Goats (XII, 4)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>My use of the verb capering in the context—recollecting the Latin
noun caper (goat)—is not a gratuitous pun, but follows La Fontaine’s own
use of the French caprice, from the same root.</p></li>
<li><p>The allusions are to the Peace of the Pyrenees, concluded in 1659
between Philip IV of Spain and the young Louis XIV’s minister Mazarin,
preparing the monarch’s political marriage to María-Teresa, Philip’s
daughter.</p></li>
<li><p>The love of the Cyclops Polyphemus for Galatea is treated in
Ovid’s Metamorphoses, XIII, 740–884.</p></li>
<li><p>The allusion is to the she-goat Amaltheia, who suckled the infant
Jupiter, hidden by his mother, Rhea, to save him from the jealous wrath
of Saturn, his father. Poussin’s painting, The Nurture of Jupiter (ca.
1637) illustrates the myth.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For Monseigneur le duc de Bourgogne (following XII, 4)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See note 1 for XII, 1.</p></li>
<li><p>See “The Old Cat and the Young Mouse” (XII, 5).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Old Cat and the Young Mouse (XII, 5)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This fable was written as a “command performance” for Louis XIV’s
grandson, the young duc de Bourgogne, for whom that title had been
revived a few years before, in 1628. According to twenty-two lines of
prefatory verse, it was composed at the request of the royal scion, “qui
avoit demandé à M. de la Fontaine une fable qui fût nommée le Chat et la
Souris” (who had asked M. de la Fontaine for a fable that might be named
the Cat and the Mouse).</p></li>
<li><p>Raminagrobis, the name La Fontaine uses for his stuffy old cat,
was borrowed, like a number of his proper names, from Rabelais
(Pantagruel, Book III, chapter 21), who gives it to the old
poet—supposedly modeled after Guillaume Crétin—visited by Pantagruel and
Panurge during their consultations on the advisability of the latter’s
marriage. (See note 1 for VII, 15.) The word came to be used throughout
the Renaissance as an adjective meaning “pompous,” “vain,” and even gave
rise to a verb, raminagrobiser, in a legal context, meaning “to
pussyfoot like a lawyer”—no pun intended.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Quarrel of the Dogs and Cats and of the Cats and Mice (XII,
8)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>See VI, 20.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Wolf and the Fox (XII, 9)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is established that the young duc de Bourgogne did, indeed,
write a French fable on the subject from a Latin model provided by
Fénelon. See Gohin, 2:370.</p></li>
<li><p>My own linguistic prejudices notwithstanding, I bow to a variety
of authoritative English dictionaries to allow “nonpareil” to rhyme with
“well.”</p></li>
<li><p>See The Iliad, XVI.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Crayfish and Her Daughter (XII, 10)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The allusion is to the League of Augsbourg, formed in 1686 of a
number of countries, among them Spain, Sweden, Holland, the Empire, and,
eventually, England, three years later.</p></li>
<li><p>Bellona was the Roman goddess of war. Unlike most of the Roman
deities—and similar in this regard to Flora, Pomona (see note 2 for
VIII, 10), and others—she was not inherited, with a change of name, from
the Greek pantheon.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Eagle and the Magpie (XII, 11)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The reference is to one Vulteius Mena, the garrulous town crier
satirized by Horace (Epistles, I, 7), who may also have been the
inspiration for “The Cobbler and the Financier” (VIII, 2).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Kite, the King, and the Fowler (XII, 12)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>François-Louis de Bourbon, the second prince de Conti
(1664–1709), was the nephew of the Grand Condé and husband of the
latter’s granddaughter Marie-Thérèse de Bourbon. The rather fulsome
encomium introducing this fable was probably written to honor their
marriage in 1688.</p></li>
<li><p>La Fontaine’s generous prognostication fell short, one can see,
by some fifty-five years.</p></li>
<li><p>See note 1 for IX, 7. Despite its Hindu (and Pythagorean) subject
of metempsychosis, this was not one of the fables inspired by Pilpay, as
La Fontaine would later admit. See Gohin, 2:371–72.</p></li>
<li><p>Metempsychosis, or reincarnation, is described as cyclic in the
Laws of Manu and other Hindu literature.</p></li>
<li><p>This is an allusion to “The Rats in Council Assembled” (II,
2).</p></li>
<li><p>The banquet of the gods is narrated in the last part of Book One
of The Iliad, with Vulcan, husband of Venus, serving nectar.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Fox, the Flies, and the Hedgehog (XII, 13)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This appearance of the hedgehog in La Fontaine’s dramatis
animalia, as he confides in a typically personal aside, was indeed the
first of his corpus. Unless, that is, one considers a prior version of
the present fable, unpublished during his lifetime, cited by various
scholars, Regnier among them (see 3:266–67). Though he obviously didn’t
know it at the time, it would also be the only one.</p></li>
<li><p>La Fontaine was not, by any means, the first to adapt this
political apologue from Aristotle’s Rhetoric (II, 20), one with a
particularly rich history. It would show up, for example, several
centuries after Aristotle, in Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews
(XVIII, vi, 5) and eventually in a variety of Spanish exemplary tales
based on the Gesta Romanorum. For the work of one of La Fontaine’s more
important French predecessors, the sixteenth-century fabulist Philibert
Guide (a.k.a. Philibert Hegemon), as well as other incarnations before
and after, see my The Fabulists French: Verse Fables of Nine Centuries,
28–29.</p></li>

<li><p>See note 1 for IX, 7.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Forest and the Woodsman (XII, 16)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One should not exaggerate La Fontaine’s seemingly
proto-environmentalist defense of nature, evident here, as in many of
his more “philosophical” fables. Much has been written on it; but,
although it is more probably something of a pastoral literary conceit
more common among his immediate predecessors—Racan, Théophile de Viau,
Tristan L’Hermite, and others—than among his citified contemporaries, it
is at least based on personal experience. Recall that, as a child, La
Fontaine delighted in accompanying his father on his woodland rounds
about his native Château-Thierry as Maître des Eaux et Forêts (Master of
the Waters and Forests)—roughly the equivalent of a forest warden cum
conservationist—and that La Fontaine himself inherited that position as
a young adult. (See, inter alia, Philip Wadsworth, Young La Fontaine
[Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 1952], 16–21.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Fox, the Wolf, and the Horse (XII, 17)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>La Fontaine’s concluding line, meaning literally “The wise man
distrusts every stranger,” certainly smacks of a proverb and may well
have preexisted his use of it here, though I find no evidence of it in
this form. In fact, sources usually cite this line as its origin; and it
surely wouldn’t be the only one of his to pass into proverbial usage.
Perhaps La Fontaine was expressing, in different dress, the then common
proverb “Défiance est mère de sureté” (Distrust is mother of security);
one whose cynical message was criticized by his contemporary, the
churchman-littérateur Bossuet, who said of it: “J’aime beaucoup mieux
être trompé que de vivre éternellement dans la défiance” (I should
rather be deceived than to live eternally in distrust). See Quitard,
291.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Fox and the Young Turkey Cocks (XII, 18)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The turkey had been introduced into Europe from North America as
early as the sixteenth century. In France, in La Fontaine’s time, one
distinguished between the full-grown dindon (turkey cock, the male of
the dinde) and the young poulet d’Inde, which today would more usually
be termed the dindonneau. All the words carry (and carried) with them
the connotation of stupidity, for which the turkey is, perhaps unjustly,
famous.</p></li>
<li><p>My phrase “fowl cohort,” echoing one above, is not a misprint.
The pun, not in the original, is my attempt to suggest something of the
La Fontaine playfulness inherent in his typical coinage la dindonnière
gent, of the original, roughly translatable as “turkeydom.”</p></li>
<li><p>One tends to think of the pseudoscientific work of the
eighteenth-century physician Franz Mesmer—he of “animal magnetism”
fame—as the beginnings of modern concern with hypnotism and such, though
the ancients (and even the primitives) were well aware of the phenomenon
of “fascination,” of which the fox’s ploy is a rudimentary example. It
may have been suggested to La Fontaine by chapter VI (“De scientia
brutorum”) of Thomas Willis’s treatise De Anima brutorum quae Hominis
vitalis ac sensitiva est exercitationes duae (London, 1672), a lengthy
passage of which is found in Regnier, 3:405–6.</p></li>
<li><p>The reference is, of course, to Harlequin (or Arlequin), the
French descendant of the Italian Arlecchino, one of the stock characters
of the commedia dell’arte, known for his improvisational talents, most
often used to extricate his masters from a variety of entanglements, and
usually not without a goodly dose of self-interest. Of his many
incarnations in the French theater, under the same or other names, the
most famous and well developed is Beaumarchais’s celebrated
Figaro.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Ape (XII, 19)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One wants to believe, certainly, that La Fontaine’s condemnation of
plagiarists as worse even than wife-beaters is the pointed, very
sardonic exaggeration of a man of letters. Be that as it may,
translators, be it said, are plagiarists too, in a sense, albeit
self-confessed and (generally) harmless.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Scythian Philosopher (XII, 20)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The reference is to the old man from Corycia, in Virgil’s Georgics
(IV, 127–33), who, “spacing herbs among his thickets, / And setting out
white lilies, slender poppies, / And vervain, felt sure that his riches
matched / The wealth of kings …” (See Virgil, Georgics, trans. Smith
Palmer Bovie [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1956], 90.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Elephant and Jupiter’s Ape (XII, 21)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See note 1 for IX, 3.</p></li>
<li><p>It is tempting to see here a wry suggestion on La Fontaine’s
part—coming full circle toward the end of his collection and, indeed, of
his life—that even the ant, arrogantly provident as he depicts her in
his earliest fable, “The Cricket and the Ant” (I, 1), can run afoul of
circumstances and need Jupiter’s help.</p></li>
<li><p>I have chosen to interpret La Fontaine’s final couplet with a
rather more ironic twist than he perhaps intended: the elephant’s size
will not deter divine concern even if it does not guarantee it
either.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The English Fox (XII, 23)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Widow of the French ambassador to Constantinople and sister of
the English ambassador to France, Madame Harvey (sometimes misspelled
Hervay) arrived in Paris in 1683. It is said that she often tried to
tempt La Fontaine to settle in England.</p></li>
<li><p>The English “prince” (i.e., king) in question was Charles
II.</p></li>
<li><p>The amatory allusion is to Hortense Mancini, duchesse de Mazarin,
and sister of La Fontaine’s protectress, the duchesse de
Bouillon.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Daphnis and Alcimadura (XII, 24)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This idyll in the style of Greek pastoral poet Theocritus (ca.
315 to ca. 250, bce) is dedicated to a daughter of Madame de la Sablière
(see IX, 20) and widow of a member of the parliament of Normandy. It is
interpreted as a desire of the mother to see her daughter remarry, which
she subsequently did. One of many truly enlightened women of her age,
she appears as a thinly veiled character in Fontenelle’s
philosophico-scientific Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes
(1686).</p></li>
<li><p>See note 5 for I, 14.</p></li>
<li><p>Erebus, in Greek and Roman mythology, was the uninviting region
between earth and Hades.</p></li>
<li><p>See The Odyssey, XI, 543, for the celebrated dispute between Ajax
and Ulysses concerning the inheritance of Achilles’ armor (see note 2
for XI, 3).</p></li>
<li><p>See The Aeneid, VI, 450 ff., for Dido’s recriminations against an
ungrateful, unloving Aeneas.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Philemon and Baucis (XII, 25)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Great-grandson of Henri IV, the duc de Vendôme (1654–1712) was an
admirer and protector of La Fontaine, whom he frequently entertained,
along with other artists and literati, at his chateau in Anet, built by
Henri III for Diane de Poitiers. La Fontaine’s toadying praise, it must
be said, not unique to this work, hardly does him credit.</p></li>
<li><p>The apparent conflation of Greek mythology (Prometheus’s
liver-plucking vultures) and Old Testament lore (the “son of Japhet”),
seems an intentional generalization of human woe. The metaphorical
transformation into human miseries of Prometheus’s punishment for
stealing fire from the heavens as a gift to Man is emphasized by the
“cross-cultural” allusion. (Unless, of course, it was a simple
negligence.)</p></li>
<li><p>Of the three Fates, Clotho, it will be recalled, was the one who
spun out the thread of life. See note 1 for V, 6.</p></li>
<li><p>Roman goddess of agriculture. See note 1 for IV, 21.</p></li>
<li><p>Zeuxis (fifth to fourth century bce) and Apelles (fourth century
bce) were celebrated Greek painters. The latter, from the court of
Macedon, was especially famous for a portrait of Alexander holding a
thunderbolt, now lost, like the rest of his works.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the Muses, Clio’s special domain was history (see note 4
for I, 14).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Matron of Ephesus (XII, 26)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This work—obviously, by its length and dramatis personae, much
more a tale than a fable, properly speaking—figures, in fact, in most
editions of La Fontaine’s Contes et nouvelles en vers. It was originally
published in 1682 and dates from at least a year earlier. Its inclusion
in Book XII of the Fables, published in 1693, is incongruous, to say the
least. Be that as it may, the story, taken from Petronius’s Satyricon
(cxi–cxii), was a favorite of many authors, both pre– and post–La
Fontaine. (The poet himself would seem to have been inspired by it years
before, at least obliquely, in “La Jeune Veuve” [VI, 21], itself also
more a conte than a fable, albeit a short one.) The present translation
appears also in La Fontaine’s Bawdy: Of Libertines, Louts, and Lechers.
The tale is not included in the Regnier edition of the Fables.</p></li>
<li><p>La Fontaine’s reference, mildly deformed in my version, is to the
family from which the pretentious Madame de Sotenville proudly claims
descent in Molière’s comedy Georges Dandin (see note 1 for IX,
9).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Belphegor (XII, 27)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>La Fontaine takes his version of this tale from Machiavelli and it
is treated subsequently by a number of others (see Gohin, 2:381). Like
“Philemon and Baucis” (XII, 25) and “The Matron of Ephesus” (XII, 26),
preceding, and “The Daughters of Mineas” (XII, 28) following, it is
hardly a fable in any but the most general sense, and is, properly
speaking, a conte. Compared with the earlier fables for which he is
generally known, these later works show the breadth and variety of his
inspiration over his long creative life. (We have to suppose that the
French schoolchildren often required to memorize fables of “Le bon Jean”
might well balk at these.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Daughters of Mineas (XII, 28)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>For a discussion of La Fontaine’s debts to Ovid, Boccaccio, and
others, see Gohin, 2:384.</p></li>
<li><p>The arts protected by Pallas, the Latin Minerva, are those
household skills of sewing, embroidery, and the like.</p></li>
<li><p>Bacchus, the Greek Dionysos, was the fruit of Jove’s seduction of
Semele (daughter of Cadmus, king of Thebes, and Harmonia, daughter of
Venus), who would be consumed by Jove’s fire when she requested to be
allowed to gaze on him in all his glory as proof of his identity. The
celebration in Bacchus’s honor was, no doubt, in thanks for wine, his
gift to Man.</p></li>
<li><p>Roman goddess of agriculture. See note 1 for IV, 21.</p></li>
<li><p>We can forgive La Fontaine for his classical periphrases: the
reference to Phoebus (Apollo), driver of the chariot of the dawn, is
more in keeping with the subject than a prosaic “it is growing late.”
But I would like to feel that he declaims such pomposities with at least
a little wry humor.</p></li>
<li><p>Hymen, son of Apollo, was the Greek and Roman god of marriage. He
was generally represented as a handsome adolescent (which cynics might
see as a realization, at least unconscious, of that institution’s
decline with one’s advancing age).</p></li>
<li><p>See note 1 of V, 6. Atropos was, of course, the most fearsome of
the trio of Fates, being the one who snipped the thread that her sisters
had spun and measured out.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>APPENDIXES</p>
<p>The Sun and the Frogs (appendix, I)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Gohin (2:387) indicates that the Latin fable in question, “Sol et
Ranae,” by one P. Commire, had many French imitators besides La
Fontaine. The present version allegorizes Louis XIV’s—the Sun
King’s—hostilities against the Dutch.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Rats’ League (appendix, II)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This fable too would refer to Louis XIV’s problems with the Dutch
as a coda to the Thirty Years’ War, ending with the Treaties of
Westphalia in 1648. The mouse represents Holland; the cat, Louis; and
“all the rats about” (line 15), Spain, Denmark, and the Empire.</p></li>

<p>Notes on Illustrations</p>
<p>David Schorr</p>
<p>Fables are always evolving. La Fontaine retells Aesop, Ovid,
Sendebar, and others, and all are translated and retranslated. The
images that often enrich these tales also change through the
centuries.</p>
<p>For the first French fables I illustrated—Norman Shapiro’s The
Fabulists French—I chose to do woodcuts, in order to recall traditions
of early book illustration. I first painted the images in Japanese brush
ink (sumie) on the wood before cutting. When the next projects came
along—two of Shapiro’s early collections of La Fontaine—I did the
illustrations directly as sumie drawings on paper. Because both volumes
were bilingual, with French and English on facing pages, and because
most fables involve two or more antagonists, I split the illustrations
onto facing pages so opponents could confront each other across the
gutter of the book, placing, for example, La Fontaine’s celebrated hare
on the right and his tortoise on the left.</p>
<p>This complete collection of the fables revives a number of my
illustrations but, for reasons of design, they are each confined to one
page. So, rather than wield a knife and gouge, or a bamboo-handled
brush, I take my computer as my easel, and I evoke the magic of
Photoshop to combine two or more characters into a single-page
illustration.</p>
<p>I was curious, of course, to see which of my more than one hundred La
Fontaine illustrations would be chosen for this volume of the Complete
Fables. Over the years, while working on these illustrations, the spirit
of La Fontaine always inspired, but the shadow of his many illustrators
often presented a weighty challenge. If I had to choose the work of a
favorite predecessor, to which I thought I could never measure up, it
would probably be Gustave Doré’s 1880 image for “The Rats in Council
Assembled.” So it was especially gratifying to have my version of that

without whom the utter fun of humanizing animals would never have come
my way.</p>
