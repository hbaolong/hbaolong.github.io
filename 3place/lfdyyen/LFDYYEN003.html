<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>John Hollander</p>
<p>With the epic formula, “Je chante les héros” (I sing those heroes),
Jean de La Fontaine begins the opening poem of his epical twelve books
of not quite epical fables. The remainder of the passage makes clear the
author’s quieter but perhaps no less modest claim, “Je chante les héros
dont Esope est le père”—and I quote, as throughout these remarks,
Professor Norman Shapiro’s splendid renderings—</p>
<p>I sing those heroes, Aesop’s progeny,</p>
<p>Whose tales, fictitious though indeed they be,</p>
<p>Contain much truth. Herein, endowed with speech—</p>
<p>Even the fish!—will all my creatures teach</p>
<p>With human voice; for animals I choose</p>
<p>To proffer lessons that we all might use.</p>
<p>Thus he addresses the Dauphin of France, to whom he observes as
well—in a long prose preface—that although Plato condemned the poets for
their untruths, he recommended Aesop. The allegorical nature of those
stories was up front, as it were, and their immediate subjects were
animals known in everyday life; La Fontaine points out that if we can’t
find or understand philosophers to teach us moral truths, bees and ants
are there to give us what we need. Truth, directness,
down-to-earthness—these were always associated with Aesop’s prose
vignettes of speaking animals.</p>
<p>The Aesopian tradition is a remarkably fruitful one. Anecdotal
stories of animals, endowed with human speech and who therewith
represent human qualities, go back as far as Hesiod and Archilochus in
early Greek poetry. We commonly associate such tales with the name of
Aesop, a slave probably living on Samos in the sixth century bce, but
“Aesop” has come to designate the canonical author of fables written
down only later by others; to this degree, his is an authorship much
like “Homer” or “Moses” or “David.” The Greek word for fable (from latin
fabula) is simply mythos, which means “story” (what we generally speak
of as Greek mythology refers to the cycles of stories about gods and
heroes). A late Greek rhetorician, Theon, defined a fable as “a false
story picturing the truth,” but that “story” could be anything from a
telling metaphor to a long and complex narration. The Aesopian stories,
whether those strictly of animals or other sorts of parable, were in
prose. But it was apparently an early practice to versify them. Plato
tells us in the Phaedo of how Socrates in prison, awaiting the execution
of his sentence, took some fables of Aesop that he knew and turned them
into verse, following the intimations of a dream to compose something.
We may surmise that his versification was in iambic lines; Socrates even
wrote, albeit in prose, an Aesopian fable of his own (about how God,
unable to reconcile the continual strife of pleasure and pain, fastened
their heads together—thus when one of them comes, the other follows). We
may imagine that one of the things that appealed to him most in Aesop
was the same homeliness of the actors and their milieux in such fables
that La Fontaine praised in his dedicatory prose cited above.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest Aesopian fables that we have are thus in verse.
Horace, for example, has a speaker in one of his satires tell the
familiar story of the country mouse and the city mouse; and versified
collections in Latin by Phaedrus in the early first century ce, and
slightly later, in Greek by Babrius, were themselves imitated and
paraphrased in prose and verse and known in various collections through
the Middle Ages. Chaucer tells and retells fables, and an elaborate
version of one of them, in “The Nun’s Priest’s Tale,” is one of the
world’s great masterpieces of profound comic vision. Renaissance poetry
contains many fables derived from Aesop, whether specifically of the
animal sort or not. Fables in Sidney, Spenser, and Shakespeare lead to
the spread of fable—often with a political agenda, as Annabel Patterson
has shown1—in the seventeenth century and thence to the extended and
well-known fables of John Gay. William Cowper, at the beginning of a
fable of his own (“Pairing Time Anticipated”), reminds us of the common
Latin root of fable and confabulate, and thereby of how much the matter
of the animals talking is central to the form. He is also clear about
how the Aesopian world is a particular kind of fictive domain, by taking
a passing swipe at Rousseau, who had insisted that no children be
allowed to hear beast-fables, because they were only vehicles of
deception (animals don’t talk and reason!):</p>
<p>I shall not ask Jean Jacques Rousseau</p>
<p>If birds confabulate or no.</p>
<p>’Tis clear, that they were always able</p>
<p>To hold discourse, at least in fable;</p>
<p>And e’en the child who knows no better</p>
<p>Than to interpret, by the letter,</p>
<p>A story of a cock and bull,</p>
<p>Must have a most uncommon skull …</p>
<p>The Aesopian tradition gives frequent rise not only to new and later
fables, but to a certain amount of meta-fabling, of fables manifestly or
implicitly about the mythopoetic bases of beast-fable itself. In a fable
in Sir Philip Sidney’s romance Arcadia, for example, all the beasts ask
Jove for a king to rule over them. He agrees but gives the as yet
incomplete human creature nothing but life itself, demanding that each
of the animals contribute something of its own particular Nature: “The
fox gave craft; the dog gave flattery; / Ass patience; the mole a
working thought; / Eagle, high look; wolf, secret cruelty,” a strange
list, mixing zoological plausibility, cliché, and off-the-wall
ascription. English fabulists in the eighteenth century welcomed the
beast-fable genre into their repertory of poetic genres, but they almost
invariably condemned the fables to speak in only one mode of verse,
rhymed tetrameter couplets, as in Cowper’s lines above, or in these from
the anonymously rendered Aesopian tale of “The Cat and the Old Rat,”
telling of how</p>
<p>[…the cat] gets upon a Shelf,</p>
<p>And to a String he hangs himself</p>
<p>By one foot, dangling with his Head</p>
<p>Downward, as if he had been dead.</p>
<p>The Rats all thought, he had been taken</p>
<p>At stealing Cheese, or gnawing Bacon;</p>
<p>Perhaps he might have foul’d the Bed,</p>
<p>Murdered a Bird, or that he had</p>
<p>Committed any other Evil</p>
<p>By instigation of the Devil</p>
<p>Or his own more malicious Nature;</p>
<p>For which they hang’d the wicked creature.2</p>
<p>Contemporary with these lines, too, is the cautionary tale into which
the witty Matthew Prior revised the well-known fable of the cat changed
into a woman from Aesop, itself turned by La Fontaine into La Chatte
métamorphosée en Femme:</p>
<p>The am’rous youth, whose tender breast</p>
<p>Was by his darling cat possesst,</p>
<p>Obtain’d of Venus his desire,</p>
<p>Howe’er irregular his fire:</p>
<p>Nature the pow’r of love obey’d:</p>
<p>The cat became a blushing maid;</p>
<p>And, on the happy change, the boy</p>
<p>Employ’d his wonder, and his joy.</p>
<p>Take care, O beauteous child, take care,</p>
<p>Lest thou prefer so rash a pray’r:</p>
<p>Nor vainly hope, the queen of love</p>
<p>Will e’er thy fav’rite’s charms improve.</p>
<p>O quickly from her shrine retreat;</p>
<p>Or tremble for thy darling’s fate.</p>
<p>The queen of love, who soon will see</p>
<p>Her own Adonis live in thee,</p>
<p>Will lightly her first loss deplore,</p>
<p>Will easily forgive the boar:</p>
<p>Her eyes with tears no more will flow;</p>
<p>With jealous rage her breast will glow;</p>
<p>And on her tabby rival’s face</p>
<p>She deep will mark her new disgrace.3</p>
<p>In France, versified Aesopian fables have a rich and interesting
history as well, seeming to outlast the life of the mode in English
(although Emerson’s fable of the mountain and the squirrel is certainly
squarely in the tradition). In Fables from Old French: Aesop’s Beasts
and Bumpkins and The Fabulists French Professor Shapiro has himself
previously translated such fables into English verse with the same kind
of skill that he has brought to his translations of La Fontaine,
commenting profusely and most enlighteningly on the French fable and its
history.</p>
<p>The Greek myths in the Hellenistic handbooks were transformed,
juxtaposed, intertwined, and brought to an amazing life of meaning and
feeling by the poetry of Ovid. In the case of the Aesopian fables, the
great transformation was wrought by Jean de La Fontaine in the
seventeenth century, who made the language of his fabulous creatures the
material for his own remarkable poetic skill: controlling tone, using a
highly original rhythm and pacing of both line length and rhyme
placement, and deploying a kind of wit that often seems to be implicitly
acknowledging that these creatures couldn’t speak except in remarkable
verse like this. His great collection of some 250 fables in twelve books
was published in three parts: the first six books in 1668, five more ten
years later, and a twelfth volume in 1694, the year before he died. This
rounded out an epical enterprise (there were twelve books in Virgil’s
Aeneid) that is half-signaled in the opening line, quoted earlier, of La
Fontaine’s dedicatory poem to the Dauphin: “Je chante les héros dont
Esope est le père” (literally, “I sing the heroes whose father is
Aesop”). La Fontaine’s gifts as a neo-classical poet are apparent in his
lovely poem Adonis, about which Paul Valéry wrote a fine and central
essay; he also exploited the intriguing form of the rondeau redoublé, a
mode which spins refrains out of its first quatrain.</p>
<p>La Fontaine’s collection contains fables of a variety of types drawn
from a variety of sources (including those of the Indian fabulist
Bidpai). The ones most familiar to English-speaking readers are perhaps
those of the animal fables most often retold in other forms, or which
became proverbial in themselves (the “sour grapes” of Le Renard et les
Raisins, the fox and the grapes), or which, when most educated people
learned French, used to be memorized at school (“Maître Corbeau, sur un
arbre perché, / Tenait en son bec un fromage,” etc.). But there are many
other sorts as well: aetiological fables like the one Socrates proposed
about pleasure and pain (L’Amour et la Folie is a splendid one of
these), or poems of wittily revisionary mythography, like the one on
what happened to the Goddess Discord after the Homeric fable got through
with her, which are rooted in traditions of Renaissance poetry. Stories
of that sort contain their own moralizations, and most often need no
“application,” as a concluding moral or interpretation was called in
medieval story-telling.</p>
<p>But it is in the beast-fables that La Fontaine’s moral and poetic
thought interfuse in another way. We cannot be sure, when we hear a
story about an ant and a grasshopper, for example, what is going to be
talked about: could it be a fable of the Imagination, the grasshopper
taking great leaps as a sort of insect Pegasus, while the drudging life
of the ant permits it to be conscious of nothing more in the world than
its burden, its task, its duty? That would, at any rate, be the
grasshopper’s story (or if cigale is more accurately translated as
cicada, then it’s a matter of singing, or fiddling, rather than
jumping). But that would be the grasshopper-view. It is the prudence of
the ant with which the Aesopian tradition has always sided, and which
has had the last word. It is only through the creatures’ discourse—by
means of the relation between the arguments they offer and their habits,
natures, and interests in the matter at hand—that the moral is deployed.
La Fontaine carries this much further than prior fabulists had ever
done, for discourse is the substance of his animal world. “Natural”
characteristics (or, rather, Aesopian, as opposed to zoologically
defined ones) play a good part in La Fontaine’s world—foxes are foxy,
after all, cats never come off as much more than con-men, and so on.</p>
<p>But the fictional power of these fables derives from two
paradoxically opposed elements, a kind of realism for which the poet is
celebrated (his animals are variously peasants, bourgeois, or nobility,
for example, rather than emblematic or heraldic creatures) and, on the
other hand, the mythical matter of there being any discourse at all. In
the epilogue to Book II, the poet acknowledges the power of his own
fiction by insisting, with a significant full rhyme on vers/univers that
unites two senses of creation:</p>
<p>Car tout parle dans l’univers;</p>
<p>Il n’est rien qui n’ait son langage:</p>
<p>Plus éloquents chez eux qu’ils ne sont dans mes vers,</p>
<p>Si ceux que j’introduis me trouvent peu fidèle,</p>
<p>Si mon oeuvre n’est pas un assez bon modèle,</p>
<p>J’ai du moins ouvert le chemin …</p>
<p>…for none</p>
<p>Is there in all the Universe but that</p>
<p>Has language of its own. And far</p>
<p>More eloquent in their own habitat</p>
<p>Are they, perforce, than when they are</p>
<p>Characters in my work. If I have erred</p>
<p>By painting them less faithfully in word</p>
<p>And deed; if I present a model flawed,</p>
<p>At least have I opened a path untrod …</p>
<p>But by asserting that nothing in the universe is without its
language, he does not mean what a naturalist would, but rather, as a
poet, that he can make them say anything believably, and thus make moral
discourse itself believable. As one commentator, Francis Duke, has so
well put it, “La Fontaine is exquisitely aware of the relation of the
speech of animals to the metaphor of the animals as man, whose proudest
attribute is speech with words.”4 A modern schoolboy’s joke is apposite
here, in that it pointedly deconstructs just this one crucial aspect of
beast-fable: it is the one about a horse and a cow engaged in a
contentious argument, until a little dog that had been listening in
silence suddenly intrudes by pointing out where a resolution lay, at
which point horse and cow, shocked, both say to each other at once,
“Look! A talking dog!” That the animals talk so well, and so humanly,
runs along in counterpoint to the general Circean moral of all fabling,
that people have animal natures usually hidden by language, custom,
society, and so on. These two notions entwined make for the basis of La
Fontaine’s poetic world. His love of wit tempers his distaste for human
folly so that it never becomes bitter or sour, whether in the language
of dialogue among the creatures, in the wonderfully flexible modes of
narration, or in the whole range of tones which he adopts in his
prefaced or appended moral “applications.” Frequently these have as much
archness, plainness, high diction, or casual wisdom as any of his
animals, the “acteurs de mon ouvrage,” as he calls them.</p>
<p>La Fontaine’s morals are not easily classifiable. His stories can
take Stoic or Epicurean positions in turn and speak variously as it were
for ants and grasshoppers. He is of the age of Molière rather than of
Voltaire, and his pragmatic naturalism and strongly anti-Cartesian views
are accompanied by a clearly manifested love both of narrative and of
his own characters, who create themselves, for the most part, through
spoken language rather than by aetiological myth. His anti-Cartesian
position is laid out most directly in the verse essay serving as an
epilogue to Book IX of the fables, the “Discourse [for Madame de la
Sablière.]” Here he seems to find a mechanistic determinism even more
offensive when applied to animals than to humans:</p>
<p>Only that some there are who will protest</p>
<p>That every animal is a machine,</p>
<p>No more; that everything within its breast,</p>
<p>Its head, is moved by springs—or so to say!</p>
<p>No soul, no choice, no sentiment;</p>
<p>Naught but a clock, ticking away</p>
<p>In even pace, blindly, with no intent.</p>
<p>Open it, and you find wheels, gears, the lot!</p>
<p>No mind; a simple mechanism, what!</p>
<p>From one wheel to the next the thought is sent</p>
<p>In a mechanical, unfeeling fashion!</p>
<p>So think these folk. An animal might feel?</p>
<p>Sense? Suffer? Love? No, no! “It is a wheel</p>
<p>Moving a wheel that moves a wheel… No passion,</p>
<p>No will!” “Then what are we?” you ask. Much more!</p>
<p>This is how good Descartes explains it …</p>
<p>He then goes on to give counterexamples of animal thought (in the
behavior of stags, partridges, and beavers), and the whole “Discourse”
concludes with what starts out sounding like one of his fables—</p>
<p>Two rats seeking a living found, one day,</p>
<p>An egg; discovery most bountiful</p>
<p>For hungry rats …</p>
<p>—but which turns out to be an ethological anecdote about the behavior
of two rats protecting their dinner from a fox by ingenious means.</p>
<p>Conversely, another general discourse on “The Power of Fables” is far
from being a philosophical disquisition. It contains a fable almost en
abîme—itself encapsulated in another story. In this case, the anecdote
is of an Athenian orator who was failing to hold the attention of his
hearers. Exhausting every conventional rhetorical device only breeds
more inattention. But then</p>
<p>…Our orator</p>
<p>Decides to turn to metaphor.</p>
<p>“Ceres,” he says, “with Eel and Swallow, went</p>
<p>Abroad one day; came to a river, wide</p>
<p>And deep. The three were most intent</p>
<p>On getting over to the other side.</p>
<p>Eel swam across and Swallow flew.</p>
<p>And so did they succeed.” “And Ceres?” cried</p>
<p>The people. “Why,” the orator replied,</p>
<p>“She flew…” “Flew?” “Yes, Ceres went flying too…</p>
<p>Into a rage, that is! Because of you!”5</p>
<p>—the “you” here being the orator’s audience, who have been brought to
attentive life, albeit by a device of breaking the epistemological frame
of a story.</p>
<p>The third-century-ce Philostratus, in one of his eikones or
descriptions of imaginary pictures, shows the Fables gathering “around
Aesop, being fond of him because he devotes himself to them … And Aesop,
methinks, is weaving some fable; at any rate his smile and his eyes
fixed on the ground indicate this.” This looks like La Fontaine, with
his eyes fixed on his page, and his ear attuned to the two harmonies of
human speech in all its variety, and the immense resources of formal
verse. This seems more appropriate as a visualization of the spirit of
the fabulist than the fantastic labyrinth built at Versailles, in the
smaller park, in 1677, which contained thirty-nine remarkable hydraulic
statuary groups of Aesopian fables, in which jets of water spurted or
spewed from the mouth of each animal in a representation of speech (the
machinery for pumping enough water from the Seine to operate these cost
the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars). At the entrance to the
labyrinth stood statues of Aesop and, of course, Cupid (as Ariadne,
holding in his hand the ball of thread as a guide to the way out of the
maze—most poets would want to create some other figure holding the guide
through Cupid’s maze). But just as Renaissance poetry, viewing the ruins
of antiquity, could claim of itself that (as in the particular putting
of one of Shakespeare’s sonnets, of the commonplace going back to
Horace) “Not marble, nor the gilded monuments / Of princes, can outlive
this powerful rhyme,” so the world of fable could arise anew in a dense,
complex, self-referential, and magnificently high-spirited poetry,
rather than frozen into unenduring stone (the labyrinth was destroyed in
1775), and sounding only of the splashing of falling water, which is
always nonsense until poetry makes it mean something.</p>
<p>Wandering through La Fontaine’s world of fable is not in the least
like going through one of the Sun King’s labyrinths, but more like a
walk through an English, or natural, sort of garden. The poet’s muse,
“aux bords d’une onde pure,” propounds its profusion of sorts of story,
shades of ironic coloring, nuances of diction, turns of allegorizing
strategy, and types of moral stance. But in all of these sorts of story
it is what happens to them when they are mises en vers by this great
poet that unifies them. The very verse itself—the so-called vers libres
of rapidly shifting line lengths and rhyming schemes (not to be confused
with le vers libre, the unrhymed “free-verse” of Rimbaud and
modernity)—creates a tone which could be unsatisfactorily characterized
as wry, witty, distanced—all of which are true of it—but which does more
than that. Both the zigzagging of the line lengths, and the
unpredictabilities even of its mode of unpredictability (the very famous
poem of the country rat and city rat is so regular in its quatrains of
unvaryingly alternating masculine and feminine lines of seven syllables
cross-rhymed abab that it is still sung as a children’s song to a
repeated melody), have both general and local effect. So, too, the
wonderfully flexible diction, with its pointed and elegantly
self-conscious use of archaic words here and there, and its constant
reminders that this world of fable is like nobody else’s. Even the
American school child who used to have to recite the line about the fox
addressing the crow (and, of course, his cheese) in “à peu près ce
langage” (in language [sort of? rather like? more or less?
approximately?] like this) would get the kind of joke—in its
self-reference to animal discourse, which is “à peu près langage,
langue, parole” in any case, and to poetry, for which reality is always
represented in “à peu près ce langage,” the language of the particular
poem.</p>
<p>Professor Norman Shapiro has previously translated three large
selections from La Fontaine’s fables into exquisite and appropriately
nuanced English verse. In these versions, there is always an assurance
of metrical control, and a sharp aptness to his decisions about diction,
so that when, for example, he makes an egregious emendation or
substitution, it rings true. I shall quote only one of these in its
entirety, preferring the somewhat startling adjustments he makes to the
old familiar fable of the fox and the crow (even with the almost
outrageous allusion at the very end) to something chaster but less
neatly done. The sense of play in, and with, the translation is somehow
an appropriate version of the poet’s own:</p>
<p>Perched on a treetop, Master Crow</p>
<p>Was clutching in his bill a cheese,</p>
<p>When Master Fox, sniffing the fragrant breeze,</p>
<p>Came by and, more or less, addressed him so:</p>
<p>“Good day to you, Your Ravenhood!</p>
<p>How beautiful you are! How fine! How fair!</p>
<p>Ah, truly, if your song could but compare</p>
<p>To all the rest, I’m sure you would</p>
<p>Be dubbed the rara avis of the wood!”</p>
<p>The crow, beside himself with joy and pride,</p>
<p>Begins to caw. He opens wide</p>
<p>His gawking beak; lets go the cheese; it</p>
<p>Falls to the ground. The fox is there to seize it,</p>
<p>Saying: “You see? Be edified:</p>
<p>Flatterers thrive on fools’ credulity.</p>
<p>The lesson’s worth a cheese, don’t you agree?”</p>
<p>The crow, shamefaced and flustered, swore—</p>
<p>Too late, however: “Nevermore!”</p>
<p>This may be perhaps the single fable most familiar to American
readers, and to play with it requires some bravura. “Your Ravenhood” for
good old “Monsieur du Corbeau” and “rara avis” for “le phénix des hôtes
de ces bois” are a little surprising, but by the time second thoughts
have let them pass, they have already worked. More interesting to me is
the sequence “His gawking beak; lets go the cheese; it / Falls to the
ground. The fox is there to seize it,” where the series of enjambed
lines culminating in the half-stumbling “cheese; it” is followed across
the line break by the falling of the cheese into another clause ending
at the middle of a line. But the whole is elegantly saved, in a
completed pentameter line, when the fox is there to seize not only the
cheese but, we feel momentarily, the fragment of verse—the fox catching
the cheese itself catches the falling half-line, in a move that is
pleased with itself even as it gives pleasure. Professor Shapiro, as in
his version of these lines, seems almost to feel viscerally the way in
which the English pentameter always stands in for the alexandrine—it’s
the same “official,” canonical line—and he uses it in this passage, as
elsewhere, appropriately. But in general, it is his ear for English
iambic verse which is so well-tuned that his lines have the sort of
authority of their own that gives credence to his strategies of
adaptation and adumbration. His diction, also, seems remarkably flexible
in exactly the right way. And adding the extraneous allusion to Poe’s
raven in the very last word is, if a self-indulgence, one for which we
should be grateful.</p>
<p>In the wonderful short fable of the mountain laboring to give birth
to the ridiculous (in the proverb: “et nascitur ridiculus mus”) mouse,
La Fontaine cannot resist moralizing it as a defense of his own retreat
from epic inflation into the wisdom of shrewd minority. Here again,
Professor Shapiro as translator seems to be taking the same kind of
pleasure in his verse as La Fontaine does in his. And here again, we can
see his poetic translation at work and at play. The pregnant mountain,
shouting and screaming so that spectators are convinced she’s about to
give birth to a city huger than Paris, produces a mouse—in La Fontaine,
everyone</p>
<p>Crut qu’elle accoucheroit sans faute</p>
<p>D’une cité plus grosse que Paris:</p>
<p>Elle accoucha d’une Souris.</p>
<p>Here the sublime rhyme of Paris/Souris, almost does it all. There’s
no way to get that in English, even house/mouse missing the epic
grandeur of the drop in scale. Shapiro doesn’t try, and simply gives us
“That all who run to watch surmise/She’ll bear a city more than Paris’
size./ A mouse is what she bore.” He doesn’t bemoan the loss of the
Paris/mouse, and gets his (or, really, English’s) own back at the end,
when, after rendering beautifully the parody of epic opening in La
Fontaine, he catches better than any other translator the magnificent
deflation at the end. La Fontaine avers that</p>
<p>Quand je songe à cette fable</p>
<p>Dont le récit est menteur</p>
<p>Et le sens est véritable,</p>
<p>Je me figure un auteur</p>
<p>Qui dit: “Je chanterai la guerre</p>
<p>Que firent les Titans au maître du tonnerre.”</p>
<p>C’est promettre beaucoup: mais qu’en sort-il souvent?</p>
<p>Du vent.</p>
<p>This final tiniest line, with its full rhyme, reminds us once again
how “hot air” (in its rhetorical sense) has density of matter inverse to
its expansiveness, like bad pseudo-poetic rhetoric. Here Shapiro is
immensely satisfying:</p>
<p>When I conceive this fiction</p>
<p>Empty of fact but full of sense,</p>
<p>It seems to me a true depiction</p>
<p>Of authors’ vain grandiloquence.</p>
<p>They promise: “Ah, my lyre will sing</p>
<p>Of Titans’ combat with the Thunder’s king.”</p>
<p>Fine words! And yet what often comes to pass?</p>
<p>Just gas.</p>
<p>His additions all come from so deep a grasp of the matter that they
spell out and gloss the issues (e.g., the “vain grandiloquence” and the
“my lyre will sing” as an English neo-classic cliché to parallel “Je
chanterai”).</p>
<p>Among La Fontaine’s fables of the kind that would not be thought of
by most readers as Aesopian is the story of Discord mentioned earlier.
It continues her story from Olympian surroundings to subsequent human
life, by giving her a father named “Thine-and-Mine,” and a brother,
“True-False,” and having her end up in residence in the inn of
marriage.</p>
<p>Ah, what an honor that the goddess chose to dwell</p>
<p>Here in our hemisphere, and not the other—</p>
<p>In every way our opposite—</p>
<p>Peopled with savages and such,</p>
<p>Who, marrying without the benefit</p>
<p>Of notary and priest, would surely not have much</p>
<p>For her to do. Well, be that as it may…</p>
<p>With Rumor as her guide, the exiled castaway</p>
<p>Roamed here and there, spreading her fame,</p>
<p>Fanning the slightest angry spark to flame,</p>
<p>And keeping Peace and Harmony at bay.</p>
<p>But Rumor soon complained, calling attention</p>
<p>To Discord’s lack of fixed address;</p>
<p>Because, when one had need of her dissension,</p>
<p>The search was long, and could be limitless.</p>
<p>And so, at length, it was decided she should be</p>
<p>Lodged in a permanent location, whence</p>
<p>She could, at proper times, dispense</p>
<p>Her services. But, seeing that we</p>
<p>Hadn’t invented convents yet, where she</p>
<p>Would be well housed, she took up residence</p>
<p>In Holy Matrimony’s hostelry.</p>
<p>The other is an aetiological fable of the blinding of Cupid (a
favorite Renaissance motif, investigated over fifty years ago by Erwin
Panofsky, pointed up by the fine ambiguity of the phrase “Love is
blind”: it could mean that Cupid, blindfolded, shoots his arrows
randomly, as well as that all lovers are blind to truths about their
desires’ objects and themselves as well), “L’Amour et la Folie.” The
translator’s skill and wit come through beautifully in it, and I can
make no better recommendation of his work than by quoting the entire
narrative part, starting with its fine handling of the internal rhyme in
the original’s “La Folie et l’Amour jouoient un jour ensemble”:</p>
<p>Folly and Love, one day at play together,</p>
<p>Had a dispute. The latter wondered whether</p>
<p>The Council of the Gods ought not be called.</p>
<p>Folly, incensed, punched, flailed away</p>
<p>And robbed the other of the light of day;</p>
<p>Whose mother, Venus, properly appalled—</p>
<p>Shrieking for vengeance, woman that she was—</p>
<p>Deafened the gods and won them to her cause:</p>
<p>Nemesis, Jove, Hell’s judges too—</p>
<p>In short, the whole Olympian crew.</p>
<p>“No punishment is hard enough,” she pleaded;</p>
<p>My son is now an invalid.</p>
<p>Do what you have to do!” The court acceded,</p>
<p>And so, indeed, do it they did:</p>
<p>In view of public weal and private woe,</p>
<p>They sentenced Folly evermore to go</p>
<p>Abroad with Love, whithersoever,</p>
<p>And be his constant guide, forever.</p>
<p>I have suggested above that Circe was the first satirist, turning men
into the animals they “really” were; she made Odysseus’s sailors into
pigs, and Odysseus himself, but for the intervention of Hermes, a fox,
or so Hawthorne suggested. In La Fontaine’s own fable, the wonderful Les
Compagnons d’Ulysse, the poet, following Plutarch and other writers,
works a splendid turn on Circe’s magic. Ulysses’ men, each transformed
into a different sort of beast, all elect, with powerful pragmatic and
satiric arguments, to remain animals rather than being returned to human
form: “Ils croyoient s’affranchir suivants leurs passions,/Ils étoient
esclaves d’eux-mêmes.” In Shapiro’s version,</p>
<p>From great and small: each, by and by,</p>
<p>Would sing the praises of their passions; free</p>
<p>To roam the woods, follow their appetite,</p>
<p>Forsake all human virtues… What they might</p>
<p>Have realized, had they thought sensibly,</p>
<p>Was that they were the slaves of their new state.</p>
<p>Circe could thus be said to have invented one mode in which moral
indignation has operated ever since, distorting the physical
representation of people and their commodities in order to render
correctly their usually hidden moral nature. She also thereby first
allowed for the art of the animal fabulist, and so was, in a sense, the
Muse of Aesop. The sixteenth-century Florentine writer G. B. Gelli,
following a lead left unfinished by Plutarch, wrote a series of ten
dialogues between Ulysses and a number of the animals who had been
transformed from humans. After Circe’s power was nullified, they had the
option of returning to human form again, but in these conversations,
each of the animals discourses eloquently, reasonably, and sometimes
learnedly about why he or she prefers not to. Given that they retain the
language in which they can present their arguments, we might imagine
that their preference is not for the animal state over the human, but in
fact for their desire to remain fabulous. La Fontaine clearly loved them
for that, as we indeed love him for showing us how much he did.</p>
