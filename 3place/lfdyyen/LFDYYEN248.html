<h4 id="the-arbiter-the-hospitaler-and-the-hermit">THE ARBITER, THE
HOSPITALER, AND THE HERMIT</h4>
<p>Three saintly men, each seeking his salvation</p>
<p>With the same spirit and one destination,</p>
<p>Chose various paths to reach it. “All roads lead</p>
<p>To Rome,” one says; and so the rivals three</p>
<p>Set about on their journeys differently.</p>
<p>The first, in matters legal, saw the need</p>
<p>To lighten all laws’ burdensome ennuis:</p>
<p>Long drawn-out cases, obstacles, distress</p>
<p>Of every sort, the infinite duress</p>
<p>Of the tribunal; and he offered freely</p>
<p>To judge them all gratis, with no thought, really,</p>
<p>Of slightest gain. Man, since the Law has been</p>
<p>Part of his life, has paid well for his sin</p>
<p>And his iniquity, indeed, by spending</p>
<p>Half of his life in suits and plaints unending.</p>
<p>(Half? Rather say three quarters, after all!) He</p>
<p>Thought he could cure this urge, this arrant folly,</p>
<p>Arbiter that he was. The second chose</p>
<p>Hospitals for his work, and praised be he!</p>
<p>To care for others and relieve the woes</p>
<p>And ills of Man is surely one of those</p>
<p>Noblest of charities—at least for me.</p>
<p>Back then, the sick were plentiful as we,</p>
<p>And gave our hospitaller more than much</p>
<p>To do. But soon he cared for Such-and-such</p>
<p>And So-and-so more than the rest—whoever</p>
<p>Moaned, groaned their bale, their bane—with never</p>
<p>A moment for the other sick messieurs</p>
<p>Entrusted to his care. Our arbiter</p>
<p>Was even more hard put: each pair</p>
<p>Of litigants found him unfair</p>
<p>And quite unable to deter</p>
<p>The scales of justice from losing their balance.</p>
<p>The arbiter, offended in his talents,</p>
<p>Flies to the hospice to confer thereat</p>
<p>With monsieur hospitaller. Both agree</p>
<p>That all they get for their fine charity</p>
<p>And human kindness is complaint. With that,</p>
<p>They quit their posts, deciding they will go</p>
<p>Fleeing into the woods to weep their woe</p>
<p>Unto the solitude. And so they do.</p>
<p>There, by a spring, by rugged cliffs, from sun</p>
<p>And wind protected, sits the other one—</p>
<p>The third. They ask his counsel. “Dear friends, who</p>
<p>Seek my advice, I promise you will find it</p>
<p>Lodged only in your heart and mind; it</p>
<p>Must come from you, who know your need. Thereto,</p>
<p>His Supreme Majesty decreed that we</p>
<p>Must know ourselves. Such is our task.</p>
<p>Do you? Have you, in Man’s society,</p>
<p>Learned who you are? It does no good to ask,</p>
<p>Surrounded by the world’s vain panoply.</p>
<p>Stir up the water. Can you see</p>
<p>Your own reflection? No! The murky cloud</p>
<p>Passes its muck-bespattered shroud</p>
<p>Over its crystal purity. But let</p>
<p>The water settle, and your silhouette</p>
<p>Appears. O brothers mine, let solitude’s</p>
<p>Peace be your home. For that is where</p>
<p>You see yourself.” So our hermit concludes.</p>
<p>He was believed. The worldly pair</p>
<p>Agreed, followed his saintly lead.</p>
<p>Doctors and lawyers scorn I not! We need</p>
<p>Their work: we plead, we suffer, die; and they,</p>
<p>Thank God, abound, earn well their pay,</p>
<p>Their honor. Still, let them not be consumed</p>
<p>By their pursuits. And you, O magistrates,</p>
<p>Ministers, princes, who seem ever doomed</p>
<p>To myriad woes; whom evil dominates</p>
<p>And fortune can corrupt; to you I say:</p>
<p>You see neither yourselves nor others. Why,</p>
<p>One moment, if your thought can thither stray,</p>
<p>Some sycophant ever comes toddling by!</p>
<p>This lesson is my last. May heaven send it</p>
<p>To be of value to the future ages.</p>
<p>I offer this, my book, to kings and sages.</p>
<p>Were there a better way to end it?</p>
<h5 id="appendixes-the-sun-and-the-frogs">Appendixes THE SUN AND THE
FROGS</h5>
<p>Imitation of the Latin Fable1</p>
<p>The daughters of the mire and muck were well</p>
<p>Protected by the Sun—king-star.</p>
<p>Nor war, nor poverty, nor fortune fell</p>
<p>Dared to approach their nation. Near and far</p>
<p>It spread its empire in a hundred places.</p>
<p>Queens of the marsh—I mean the frogs, of course,</p>
<p>For what harm can one do, perforce,</p>
<p>Who, in such wise, honors and graces</p>
<p>Lowly things with fine names?… As I was saying…</p>
<p>Intolerable airs displaying,</p>
<p>They dared intrigue and act against</p>
<p>Their benefactor. Favors once dispensed</p>
<p>Were long forgotten. Arrogance and pride</p>
<p>Were all that moved them, and they plied</p>
<p>Their endless plaints importunate by night.</p>
<p>No sleep was possible withal.</p>
<p>Had their neighbors thought them right,</p>
<p>One and all, both great and small,</p>
<p>Would have been convinced to rise</p>
<p>In arms against that great orb of the skies.</p>
<p>To hear them, it was his intent</p>
<p>To suck the swamp, drink it all dry till spent!</p>
<p>No choice now but to mobilize</p>
<p>Their troops and arm themselves, lest he</p>
<p>Should declare his hostility…</p>
<p>Missions of the croaking folk</p>
<p>Go about to all the states.</p>
<p>If one listened how they spoke,</p>
<p>One would think the world awaits</p>
<p>Sure disaster just because</p>
<p>Four dank marshes give one pause.</p>
<p>Still, as for their harsh lament, it</p>
<p>Lasts and lasts. But frogs had best</p>
<p>Give their grumbling tongues a rest.</p>
<p>If the Sun grows discontent, it</p>
<p>Will go badly with their band—</p>
<p>Their whole state aquatic—and</p>
<p>They are certain to repent it.</p>
