LA SABLIÈRE 1</h4>
<p>Iris,2 how I would sing your praises, nor</p>
<p>Would it be difficult; but oft before—</p>
<p>A hundred times—you would refuse to let</p>
<p>My verse so do! How many a vain coquette—</p>
<p>Most, indeed!—yearn for all that flattery</p>
<p>That man will set before them, eagerly</p>
<p>Paying it heed. I cannot fuss or fret</p>
<p>Over their humor: belles, kings, gods will be</p>
<p>Ever moved by that nectar! Any wonder?</p>
<p>Praise is that draught the poet-race prepares</p>
<p>To serve unto the master of the thunder</p>
<p>And all earthly divinities. Yes, theirs</p>
<p>It is. But, Iris, it is not for you.</p>
<p>No. You want nothing of this brew,</p>
<p>This heady heavenly liqueur;</p>
<p>And in its place, instead, you much prefer</p>
<p>To let chance offer a libation:</p>
<p>Subjects a hundredfold—philosophy,</p>
<p>Pleasantry, science, leaping fancy-free,</p>
<p>To, fro, in deep or shallow conversation.</p>
<p>Even things that worldly society</p>
<p>Does not believe, or mocks. No matter.</p>
<p>From wondrous whimsy to the idlest chatter,</p>
<p>Discussion is a flowerbed, in which</p>
<p>Flora3 will spread her treasures rich.</p>
<p>The bee lights where she will, sips, sucks… Thereat, her</p>
<p>Honey’s store springs from everything she touches.</p>
<p>That said, pray pardon me if now and then</p>
<p>In this, my verse, I too sup wide. For such is</p>
<p>My wont. So do I sip now, when</p>
<p>I touch upon a subtle question, new</p>
<p>To philosophic speculation—do</p>
<p>You know whereof I speak? Be not distressed</p>
<p>Thereat… Well then, what do I mean?</p>
<p>Only that some there are who will protest</p>
<p>That every animal is a machine,</p>
<p>No more; that everything within its breast,</p>
<p>Its head, is moved by springs—or so to say!</p>
<p>No soul, no choice, no sentiment;</p>
<p>Naught but a clock, ticking away</p>
<p>In even pace, blindly, with no intent.</p>
<p>Open it, and you find wheels, gears, the lot!</p>
<p>No mind; a simple mechanism, what!</p>
<p>From one wheel to the next the thought is sent</p>
<p>In a mechanical, unfeeling fashion!</p>
<p>So think these folk. An animal might feel?</p>
<p>Sense? Suffer? Love? No, no! “It is a wheel</p>
<p>Moving a wheel that moves a wheel… No passion,</p>
<p>No will!” “Then what are we?” you ask. Much more!</p>
<p>This is how good Descartes explains it. For,</p>
<p>Among the pagans, surely he</p>
<p>Would be considered a divinity—</p>
<p>This mortal ’twixt the human and the holy.</p>
<p>(As is, between mollusk and man, the lowly</p>
<p>Pack mule and such!) To wit, this is</p>
<p>His thought: “Of all the animals God wrought,</p>
<p>I have, beside the gift of thought,</p>
<p>The knowledge that I think.”4 Now, follow his</p>
<p>Reasoning, fair Iris: “If beasts, indeed,</p>
<p>Did think, they would—be it agreed—</p>
<p>Not think of thinking: thought per se.”</p>
<p>Descartes goes further and denies that they</p>
<p>Can think at all—think what we may, you, I.</p>
<p>Yet, when a ten-point stag, the hunters’ prey,</p>
<p>Hears, in the wood, their blatant cry;</p>
<p>Tries to outrun their blaring horn,</p>
<p>Seeking in vain to mask his tracks—forlorn,</p>
<p>Heavy with years—and spies another, younger</p>
<p>Stag; falls behind him, panting and outdone,</p>
<p>He leaves him to the hounds’ and hunters’ hunger!</p>
<p>What reasoning to save his life, for one</p>
<p>Who, some would fain insist, has none!</p>
<p>Then back he goes to flee, feinting and dodging,</p>
<p>And with a hundred ruses lodging</p>
<p>Inside his head; all worthy of the great</p>
<p>Chieftains of old, and of a better fate!</p>
<p>When he lies slain, at last, those who pursue him</p>
<p>Flay him with honors rendered to him.</p>
<p>Consider too</p>
<p>The partridge, who—</p>
<p>Seeing her hatchlings in a posture fraught</p>
<p>With danger, still unfeathered (hence</p>
<p>Unable to go flying thence,</p>
<p>Fleeing their death)—though much distraught,</p>
<p>Will feign that she is wounded, drag a wing,</p>
<p>And lure hunter and hound, thus succoring</p>
<p>Her brood: the fowler thinks the dog has caught</p>
<p>The bird; but she laughs, flies aloft, whilst he</p>
<p>Watches with gaze bemused, shamefacedly.</p>
<p>There is a northern land we know5</p>
<p>Where one and all, in primitive</p>
<p>And utter ignorance, still live</p>
<p>As live they did, long, long ago.</p>
<p>The humans, that is; for the beasts are very</p>
<p>Adept in deeds constructionary.</p>
<p>Stemming the rivers, streams, they show how skilled</p>
<p>They are, thanks to the dams they build,</p>
<p>Bridging from shore to shore the swelling flood.</p>
<p>Solidly too, with log, then mud,</p>
<p>In layers placed. Nor do these beavers shirk</p>
<p>Their tasks; the older make the younger work</p>
<p>Unceasing. They who, in that state ideal</p>
<p>Of Plato’s, spread the commonweal,</p>
<p>Are amateurs compared to these</p>
<p>Amphibious beaver families.</p>
<p>In winter they can raise their houses, scurry</p>
<p>Across the streams on bridges quickly laid;</p>
<p>Whilst men, if they would do so in a hurry,</p>
<p>Have no recourse, I am afraid,</p>
<p>For all their wit, except to swim.</p>
<p>Madame, some are there who will still</p>
<p>Despise the lowly beast, consider him</p>
<p>A mere machine, body devoid of will,</p>
<p>Lacking in thought, empty of mind.</p>
<p>Not I! I am not so inclined</p>
<p>To do, and pray you listen to a story</p>
<p>Told by the Polish king,6 hero enshrined,</p>
<p>Whose very name alone rings glory,</p>
<p>Bulwark against the Turk. Now then,</p>
<p>He tells (and kings tell true!) how war’s disorder,</p>
<p>Over the years, has turned his border</p>
<p>Into a battleground: of beasts, not men!—</p>
<p>Renard’s descendants—passing through</p>
<p>Their blood, father to son, their legendary</p>
<p>Enmities, with such skill in military</p>
<p>Craft brought thereto, that they, indeed, outdo</p>
<p>War’s humankind practitioners</p>
<p>(Even in times contemporary!), using</p>
<p>Ambushes, spies, scouts, sorties, choosing</p>
<p>A myriad strategies, as connoisseurs</p>
<p>Of warfare (that foul daughter of the Styx,</p>
<p>Mother of heroes) with the clever tricks,</p>
<p>Ruses, wiles, taught by common sense</p>
<p>And much perfected by experience.</p>
<p>Ah! Could the Acheron7 but give</p>
<p>Homer to us once more, that he might sing</p>
<p>Their exploits! Could our own Descartes but live</p>
<p>Again, how would his reasoning—</p>
<p>Rival of Epicurus, he!—explain</p>
<p>All these examples? How? He would maintain,</p>
<p>As I have said, that, with but spring</p>
<p>And such does nature bring about these deeds</p>
<p>In beasts; that memory depends</p>
<p>On matter physical; and, to those ends,</p>
<p>The animal, impelled to action, needs</p>
<p>No more than that: an object, seen before,</p>
<p>Returns, goes searching through the store</p>
<p>Of past experience for image placed</p>
<p>Therein; whereon another path is traced</p>
<p>To bring it back. All that, without</p>
<p>The help of thought. But we, no doubt,</p>
<p>Act differently. Will it is, and intent,</p>
<p>That spur us on; not instinct, not the mere</p>
<p>Object itself. I speak, I persevere,</p>
<p>I sense in me something intelligent</p>
<p>That causes my machine to move, succinct</p>
<p>And definite, and yet distinct,</p>
<p>Separate from the body; but the latter</p>
<p>Bends to its all-embracing rule.</p>
<p>How? Why? Ah, that precisely is the matter</p>
<p>To be resolved! I see the tool</p>
<p>Obey my hand and do its bidding. But</p>
<p>What guides my hand? And who or what</p>
<p>Is there to guide the heavens’ rapid course?</p>
<p>Is there some angel handling all those spheres?</p>
<p>A spirit lives in us, a mind, a force</p>
<p>To wind the springs and turn the gears</p>
<p>Whence comes our thought. But how? Not mine,</p>
<p>The answer! Only in the breast divine—</p>
<p>God’s bosom—will we find it; and if I</p>
<p>Must speak sincerely by the bye,</p>
<p>Even Descartes could not respond to this.</p>
<p>He and I, on that point, agree.</p>
<p>But what I do know, fair Iris,</p>
<p>Is that the spirit that moves Man to do</p>
<p>The things he does is not the one that you</p>
<p>Have seen moving my animals in these</p>
<p>Examples: it is his Humanity’s</p>
<p>Alone, to grace his body’s sacred shrine.</p>
<p>That said, we must no less consign</p>
<p>More to our animals than to mere plants!</p>
<p>Plants breathe as well, but in no circumstance</p>
<p>Could they do what my beasts have done!</p>
<p>Now, how would one explain another one?</p>
