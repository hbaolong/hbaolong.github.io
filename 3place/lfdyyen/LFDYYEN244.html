<h4 id="for-monseigneur-le-duc-de-vendôme-1">FOR MONSEIGNEUR LE DUC DE
VENDÔME 1</h4>
<p>Nor gold nor grandeur brings us happiness:</p>
<p>The wealth and fleeting pleasure we possess</p>
<p>From those unsure, fickle divinities</p>
<p>Are brief at best. Therewith our miseries,</p>
<p>Our agonies abide: vultures that pluck</p>
<p>At the poor son of Japhet,2 whose ill luck</p>
<p>It was to be chained to a cliff; whereas</p>
<p>The humble, lowly habitation has</p>
<p>No need to pay such tribute. There, peace-blessed,</p>
<p>The sage lives out his life and scorns the rest.</p>
<p>Roaming the wood, content with simplest things,</p>
<p>He sees, spread at his feet, minions of kings,</p>
<p>Of wealth possessed, and reads the eloquent</p>
<p>Proof—on the brows of those whose lives are spent</p>
<p>In empty luxury—that one must pay</p>
<p>Fortune for what she sells, not gives away.</p>
<p>And, when comes time to quit his life, it is</p>
<p>As if fair evening bears that day of his</p>
<p>Off to its peaceful night… Well, Philemon—</p>
<p>Who with his Baucis dwelt—was such a one.</p>
<p>Couple much loving and much loved, they were</p>
<p>Devoted, she to him and he to her,</p>
<p>Since the sweet springtime of their youth; and love</p>
<p>Had turned their hut into a shrine thereof.</p>
<p>Clotho3 took pleasure measuring out the thread</p>
<p>Of each; and, though long years they had been wed,</p>
<p>Their flame was not by time or marriage faded.</p>
<p>Each was the other’s all; and both, unaided</p>
<p>By servant’s hands, for two score summers, tilled</p>
<p>Garden and field, with soul deeply fulfilled</p>
<p>Thereby. But everything in time grows old.</p>
<p>Furrows wrinkled their brows; and, though not cold,</p>
<p>Their passion cooled a bit. Friendship became</p>
<p>Its surrogate, and yet could heat to flame</p>
<p>When love’s darts pricked it hot… Now then, their town</p>
<p>Was filled with folk of scurrilous renown—</p>
<p>Cold and hard-hearted—such that Jupiter</p>
<p>Decides to purge the earth of them. Demur</p>
<p>He will not. Leaving, rather, then and there,</p>
<p>With his son, quick of tongue, he rends the air…</p>
<p>Arrives… The pair, decked out in pilgrim guise,</p>
<p>Knock on a thousand doors: no one replies.</p>
<p>Not one! And, as the gods prepare to quit</p>
<p>Such a vile, shameful place, lo! their eyes hit</p>
<p>Upon a humble hut, off from the road,</p>
<p>That seems an honest, welcoming abode,</p>
<p>Free of disgrace. Whereat god Mercury—</p>
<p>The son, eloquent one (for it was he)—</p>
<p>Wishing to try once more, knocks on the door.</p>
<p>It opens in a trice… Standing before</p>
<p>Our pilgrim-gods, good Philemon declares:</p>
<p>“Methinks you travel far. The thoroughfare’s</p>
<p>Journey has tired you both, no doubt. Come, rest.</p>
<p>We have but little, but it is the best</p>
<p>That we can offer you. Alas, messieurs,</p>
<p>Gone is the wondrous day when Jupiter,</p>
<p>Though carved of wood, heeded our every prayer!</p>
<p>Now that they fashion him of gold, we fare</p>
<p>Far worse! Deaf is he to our pleas, I fear!”</p>
<p>Then, to his Baucis: “Go, make haste my dear</p>
<p>And warm the water for our guests, though we</p>
<p>Are not so quick as once we used to be.”</p>
<p>Blowing the charcoal embers back to life,</p>
<p>Slowly, laboriously, his gentle wife</p>
<p>Obeys. They wash the travelers’ feet and ask</p>
<p>Their pardon for the slowness of the task.</p>
<p>Philemon speaks to them the while, but not</p>
<p>Of grandeur, gaming, wealth—the kingly lot.</p>
<p>Rather he talks of pleasures innocent</p>
<p>And rare, in woods, fields, orchards, sweetly spent.</p>
<p>Meantime, Baucis the rustic meal lays out</p>
<p>Upon a rough-hewn table, wrought without</p>
<p>Compass or such, one of whose legs—ill-starred,</p>
<p>Wracked too by time—was held firm by a shard</p>
<p>Of earthenware, time-wracked as well. (At least</p>
<p>So it was said.) A cloth, for solemn feast</p>
<p>Reserved—worn, flower-spread—had but a bit</p>
<p>Of Ceres’4 bounty fair to cover it;</p>
<p>A little milk as well. Our voyageurs</p>
<p>Divine, most thirsty from their travels, were</p>
<p>Content to mix their lowly country wine</p>
<p>With a stream’s waters, pure and crystalline.</p>
<p>But as they do, behold! The more they pour,</p>
<p>The more the jug contains! Kneeling before</p>
<p>The godly pair, Baucis and Philemon</p>
<p>Know that a miracle has here been done!</p>
<p>The veil is lifted from their eyes, and there</p>
<p>Stands Jupiter, dark-browed, with that fierce air</p>
<p>That shakes the skies from pole to pole. “Pray, sire,”</p>
<p>Begs Philemon, “spare us your holy ire</p>
<p>At our most modest welcome! How could we</p>
<p>Have dreamed that such as Your Divinity</p>
<p>Would be our guest? The food we offered you</p>
<p>Was paltry, sire, at best. Still, thereunto,</p>
<p>Even if we were kings, how could we serve</p>
<p>What you, the masters of the world, deserve?</p>
<p>True, it came from the heart. But finer yet</p>
<p>The gods expect. And surely they would whet</p>
<p>Their appetite not on the heart’s intent</p>
<p>Sincere, but on more worldly nourishment.</p>
<p>Baucis, my love,” he asks, “what worthier fare</p>
<p>Can we yet offer them? Pray, go prepare</p>
<p>As best you can!” Out in the garden she</p>
<p>Had kept a partridge, and had tenderly</p>
<p>Raised it since birth. She gives it chase; but it</p>
<p>Flees from her trembling grasp and, to outwit</p>
<p>Her vain pursuit, perches betwixt the knees</p>
<p>Of Jupiter himself, as he decrees</p>
<p>The town’s demise, decides the time has come</p>
<p>To cast his shadow over sinnerdom.</p>
<p>Down from the mountains roll the shades, and spill</p>
<p>Over the valleys. Now the two gods will</p>
<p>Quit the abode and lead therefrom their pair</p>
<p>Of hosts. Cries Jove: “No longer will I bear</p>
<p>The ills this race commits! Now shall it be</p>
<p>Destroyed. Come,” says the god. “You, Mercury,</p>
<p>Summon the winds. And you, iniquitous,</p>
<p>Foul folk, who closed your homes and hearts to us,</p>
<p>Be now undone!” As thus he spoke, a gale</p>
<p>Bellowed across the plain. The couple, frail</p>
<p>And bent with years, followed as best they could,</p>
<p>Tottering, each, with a slim cane of wood</p>
<p>To lean upon, until, by both the grace</p>
<p>Of the two gods—and fright!—they reach the place</p>
<p>Proposed: a hill hard by. The pair peer down,</p>
<p>Watch as a hundred clouds lash at the town</p>
<p>Below, unleash their wrath, go crashing, sweep</p>
<p>Off in a flood divine, all in a heap—</p>
<p>Acolytes of the gods—people, beasts, trees,</p>
<p>Houses, and orchards, till no trace of these,</p>
<p>Or those, or anything at all remains.</p>
<p>In secret Baucis weeps; the havoc pains</p>
<p>And grieves her. What? That beasts should suffer so?</p>
<p>Just was the people’s punishment. But oh!</p>
<p>Innocent beasts as well? Meanwhile, in but</p>
<p>An instant, lo! the thatched roof of their hut</p>
<p>Turns to a glistening gold before their eyes,</p>
<p>With marbled pillars rising to the skies,</p>
<p>Gleaming in all its new magnificence;</p>
<p>And, painted on the wainscot, the events</p>
<p>I have described, traced by no mortal hand—</p>
<p>No Zeuxis, no Apelles,5 or their band</p>
<p>Of human limners! Awed, confounded, our</p>
<p>Husband and wife, thinking some godly power</p>
<p>Has brought them to Olympus, say: “Might we,</p>
<p>Your humble servants, have such purity</p>
<p>Of hand and heart, that we, in priestly wise,</p>
<p>May bring to you, O Jove, the prayers, the cries,</p>
<p>The pleas of simple pilgrims!” Whereupon</p>
<p>The god grants their request; whence Philemon</p>
<p>Makes yet one more: “Would that our mortal tether</p>
<p>Come to an end, my wife’s and mine, together,</p>
<p>Serving your altars. No more could we ask</p>
<p>Of Clotho than this final twofold task!</p>
<p>I should not mourn my Baucis, and her tears</p>
<p>Would irk you not.” Jupiter listens, hears,</p>
<p>Agrees… Now let me tell you, if I dare,</p>
<p>A fact hard to believe. One day, as there</p>
<p>They sat—our saintly pair, that is—before</p>
<p>The temple gate, as pilgrims more and more</p>
<p>Astounded, listened, Philemon said: “This</p>
<p>Has not forever been an edifice</p>
<p>Unto the gods immortal. No! It was</p>
<p>Surrounded by a city without laws;</p>
<p>A foul, barbaric place, whose people scorned</p>
<p>The very gods, and who—undone, unmourned—</p>
<p>Knew wrath celestial! And we two are all</p>
<p>That still remains. Herein each sacred wall</p>
<p>Recounts the tale, and what is yet to be,</p>
<p>Painted by Jove himself…” As lovingly</p>
<p>He spoke, he cast now and again a glance</p>
<p>At Baucis, who, motionless in her stance,</p>
<p>Was turning to a tree, her arms outspread.</p>
<p>He tried to spread his own, but could not. Dead,</p>
<p>Too, was his tongue: the tree-bark pressed it mute.</p>
<p>And, as their leafy bodies now took root,</p>
<p>Their minds whispered a last farewell!… Then, too,</p>
<p>The pilgrim band, astonished, said adieu</p>
<p>To human form. Baucis to linden turned,</p>
<p>And Philemon to oak: each one had earned</p>
<p>The boon that Love to wedded bliss had paid,</p>
<p>Bowed low with myriad fruits. When, in their shade,</p>
<p>A couple sits, despite the years thereof,</p>
<p>Their hearts will ever taste the joys of love!</p>
<p>Ah! had I known… Alas! For me, too late!</p>
<p>Gone are my gifts. Let me but celebrate</p>
<p>This famous metamorphosis of old,</p>
<p>By many a faithful witness told, retold…</p>
<p>Clio6 decreed that it in verse should be</p>
<p>Set down for all future humanity,</p>
<p>And to another’s great name be related.</p>
<p>Vendôme, I pray your largesse unabated</p>
<p>Grant me the praise I seek. Let Envy not,</p>
<p>Nor Time, subdue the honor of my lot.</p>
<p>Enchain those demons lest they still my tongue,</p>
<p>Foes of those heroes that my voice has sung</p>
<p>And ever shall; and you, Vendôme, foremost</p>
<p>Amongst them; you, my ever-generous host;</p>
<p>You, who a myriad qualities possess</p>
<p>With not one flaw; whose virtues are no less</p>
<p>Than infinite! Ah! Might I own the pen</p>
<p>To praise them all, O most beloved of men,</p>
<p>Whose heaven-sent taste graces my works far more</p>
<p>Than all the skill wherewith I strive therefor.</p>
<p>Few are the lofty men, or lowly, who</p>
<p>Know, by such favors, that Jove loves them. You,</p>
<p>Child of the gods, are such a one; and I</p>
<p>Dare to declare it in my verse hereby,</p>
<p>To one and all. Clio has, in her breast,</p>
<p>Refined it in Homeric fashion, lest</p>
<p>It not please you enough. Apollo had—</p>
<p>Or so, at least, they tell us—promptly bade</p>
<p>Her and her sister Muses to convey</p>
<p>That sacred valley to your fair Anet.</p>
<p>And so they did. Now may we long give thanks</p>
<p>In the shade of the boughs that line its banks!</p>
<p>May they lift up their verdant brows, anon,</p>
<p>As once did Baucis and her Philemon!</p>
