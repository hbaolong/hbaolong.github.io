<h4 id="the-story-continues">The story continues…</h4>
<p>Turn the page to read the first chapter of</p>
<p>The Hunger Games.</p>
<p>When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch
out, seeking Prim’s warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of
the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our
mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping.</p>
<p>I prop myself up on one elbow. There’s enough light in the bedroom to
see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her side, cocooned in my
mother’s body, their cheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks
younger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prim’s face is as fresh as a
raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named. My mother
was very beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me.</p>
<p>Sitting at Prim’s knees, guarding her, is the world’s ugliest cat.
Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the color of rotting
squash. Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his muddy yellow coat
matched the bright flower. He hates me. Or at least distrusts me. Even
though it was years ago, I think he still remembers how I tried to drown
him in a bucket when Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly
swollen with worms, crawling with fleas. The last thing I needed was
another mouth to feed. But Prim begged so hard, cried even, I had to let
him stay. It turned out okay. My mother got rid of the vermin and he’s a
born mouser. Even catches the occasional rat. Sometimes, when I clean a
kill, I feed Buttercup the entrails. He has stopped hissing at me.</p>
<p>Entrails. No hissing. This is the closest we will ever come to
love.</p>
<p>I swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots. Supple
leather that has molded to my feet. I pull on trousers, a shirt, tuck my
long dark braid up into a cap, and grab my forage bag. On the table,
under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike, sits
a perfect little goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves. Prim’s gift to me
on reaping day. I put the cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip
outside.</p>
<p>Our part of District 12, nicknamed the Seam, is usually crawling with
coal miners heading out to the morning shift at this hour. Men and women
with hunched shoulders, swollen knuckles, many who have long since
stopped trying to scrub the coal dust out of their broken nails, the
lines of their sunken faces. But today the black cinder streets are
empty. Shutters on the squat gray houses are closed. The reaping isn’t
until two. May as well sleep in. If you can.</p>
<p>Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam. I only have to pass a
few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow. Separating the
Meadow from the woods, in fact enclosing all of District 12, is a high
chain-link fence topped with barbed-wire loops. In theory, it’s supposed
to be electrified twenty-four hours a day as a deterrent to the
predators that live in the woods — packs of wild dogs, lone cougars,
bears — that used to threaten our streets. But since we’re lucky to get
two or three hours of electricity in the evenings, it’s usually safe to
touch. Even so, I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum
that means the fence is live. Right now, it’s silent as a stone.
Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out on my belly and slide
under a two-foot stretch that’s been loose for years. There are several
other weak spots in the fence, but this one is so close to home I almost
always enter the woods here.</p>
<p>As soon as I’m in the trees, I retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows
from a hollow log. Electrified or not, the fence has been successful at
keeping the flesh-eaters out of District 12. Inside the woods they roam
freely, and there are added concerns like venomous snakes, rabid
animals, and no real paths to follow. But there’s also food if you know
how to find it. My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown
to bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing even to bury. I was
eleven then. Five years later, I still wake up screaming for him to
run.</p>
<p>Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching carries
the severest of penalties, more people would risk it if they had
weapons. But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife.
My bow is a rarity, crafted by my father along with a few others that I
keep well hidden in the woods, carefully wrapped in waterproof covers.
My father could have made good money selling them, but if the officials
found out he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion.
Most of the Peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt
because they’re as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is. In fact, they’re
among our best customers. But the idea that someone might be arming the
Seam would never have been allowed.</p>
<p>In the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest
apples. But always in sight of the Meadow. Always close enough to run
back to the safety of District 12 if trouble arises. “District Twelve.
Where you can starve to death in safety,” I mutter. Then I glance
quickly over my shoulder. Even here, even in the middle of nowhere, you
worry someone might overhear you.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I scared my mother to death, the things I would
blurt out about District 12, about the people who rule our country,
Panem, from the far-off city called the Capitol. Eventually I understood
this would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue
and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could
ever read my thoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only polite
small talk in the public market. Discuss little more than trades in the
Hob, which is the black market where I make most of my money. Even at
home, where I am less pleasant, I avoid discussing tricky topics. Like
the reaping, or food shortages, or the Hunger Games. Prim might begin to
repeat my words and then where would we be?</p>
<p>In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be myself. Gale. I
can feel the muscles in my face relaxing, my pace quickening as I climb
the hills to our place, a rock ledge overlooking a valley. A thicket of
berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes. The sight of him waiting
there brings on a smile. Gale says I never smile except in the
woods.</p>
<p>“Hey, Catnip,” says Gale. My real name is Katniss, but when I first
told him, I had barely whispered it. So he thought I’d said Catnip. Then
when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for
handouts, it became his official nickname for me. I finally had to kill
the lynx because he scared off game. I almost regretted it because he
wasn’t bad company. But I got a decent price for his pelt.</p>
<p>“Look what I shot.” Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck
in it, and I laugh. It’s real bakery bread, not the flat, dense loaves
we make from our grain rations. I take it in my hands, pull out the
arrow, and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose, inhaling the
fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva. Fine bread like this is
for special occasions.</p>
<p>“Mm, still warm,” I say. He must have been at the bakery at the crack
of dawn to trade for it. “What did it cost you?”</p>
<p>“Just a squirrel. Think the old man was feeling sentimental this
morning,” says Gale. “Even wished me luck.”</p>
<p>“Well, we all feel a little closer today, don’t we?” I say, not even
bothering to roll my eyes. “Prim left us a cheese.” I pull it out.</p>
<p>His expression brightens at the treat. “Thank you, Prim. We’ll have a
real feast.” Suddenly he falls into a Capitol accent as he mimics Effie
Trinket, the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to read out
the names at the reaping. “I almost forgot! Happy Hunger Games!” He
plucks a few blackberries from the bushes around us. “And may the odds
—” He tosses a berry in a high arc toward me.</p>
<p>I catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my teeth. The
sweet tartness explodes across my tongue. “— be ever in your favor!” I
finish with equal verve. We have to joke about it because the
alternative is to be scared out of your wits. Besides, the Capitol
accent is so affected, almost anything sounds funny in it.</p>
<p>I watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread. He could be
my brother. Straight black hair, olive skin, we even have the same gray
eyes. But we’re not related, at least not closely. Most of the families
who work the mines resemble one another this way.</p>
<p>That’s why my mother and Prim, with their light hair and blue eyes,
always look out of place. They are. My mother’s parents were part of the
small merchant class that caters to officials, Peacekeepers, and the
occasional Seam customer. They ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part
of District 12. Since almost no one can afford doctors, apothecaries are
our healers. My father got to know my mother because on his hunts he
would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell them to her shop to be
brewed into remedies. She must have really loved him to leave her home
for the Seam. I try to remember that when all I can see is the woman who
sat by, blank and unreachable, while her children turned to skin and
bones. I try to forgive her for my father’s sake. But to be honest, I’m
not the forgiving type.</p>
<p>Gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese, carefully
placing a basil leaf on each while I strip the bushes of their berries.
We settle back in a nook in the rocks. From this place, we are invisible
but have a clear view of the valley, which is teeming with summer life,
greens to gather, roots to dig, fish iridescent in the sunlight. The day
is glorious, with a blue sky and soft breeze. The food’s wonderful, with
the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting in our
mouths. Everything would be perfect if this really was a holiday, if all
the day off meant was roaming the mountains with Gale, hunting for
tonight’s supper. But instead we have to be standing in the square at
two o’clock waiting for the names to be called out.</p>
<p>“We could do it, you know,” Gale says quietly.</p>
<p>“What?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we could
make it,” says Gale.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to respond. The idea is so preposterous.</p>
<p>“If we didn’t have so many kids,” he adds quickly.</p>
<p>They’re not our kids, of course. But they might as well be. Gale’s
two little brothers and a sister. Prim. And you may as well throw in our
mothers, too, because how would they live without us? Who would fill
those mouths that are always asking for more? With both of us hunting
daily, there are still nights when game has to be swapped for lard or
shoelaces or wool, still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs
growling.</p>
<p>“I never want to have kids,” I say.</p>
<p>“I might. If I didn’t live here,” says Gale.</p>
<p>“But you do,” I say, irritated.</p>
<p>“Forget it,” he snaps back.</p>
<p>The conversation feels all wrong. Leave? How could I leave Prim, who
is the only person in the world I’m certain I love? And Gale is devoted
to his family. We can’t leave, so why bother talking about it? And even
if we did . . . even if we did . . . where did this stuff about having
kids come from? There’s never been anything romantic between Gale and
me. When we met, I was a skinny twelve-year-old, and although he was
only two years older, he already looked like a man. It took a long time
for us to even become friends, to stop haggling over every trade and
begin helping each other out.</p>
<p>Besides, if he wants kids, Gale won’t have any trouble finding a
wife. He’s good-looking, he’s strong enough to handle the work in the
mines, and he can hunt. You can tell by the way the girls whisper about
him when he walks by in school that they want him. It makes me jealous
but not for the reason people would think. Good hunting partners are
hard to find.</p>
<p>“What do you want to do?” I ask. We can hunt, fish, or gather.</p>
<p>“Let’s fish at the lake. We can leave our poles and gather in the
woods. Get something nice for tonight,” he says.</p>
<p>Tonight. After the reaping, everyone is supposed to celebrate. And a
lot of people do, out of relief that their children have been spared for
another year. But at least two families will pull their shutters, lock
their doors, and try to figure out how they will survive the painful
weeks to come.</p>
<p>We make out well. The predators ignore us on a day when easier,
tastier prey abounds. By late morning, we have a dozen fish, a bag of
greens and, best of all, a gallon of strawberries. I found the patch a
few years ago, but Gale had the idea to string mesh nets around it to
keep out the animals.</p>
<p>On the way home, we swing by the Hob, the black market that operates
in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal. When they came up with a
more efficient system that transported the coal directly from the mines
to the trains, the Hob gradually took over the space. Most businesses
are closed by this time on reaping day, but the black market’s still
fairly busy. We easily trade six of the fish for good bread, the other
two for salt. Greasy Sae, the bony old woman who sells bowls of hot soup
from a large kettle, takes half the greens off our hands in exchange for
a couple of chunks of paraffin. We might do a tad better elsewhere, but
we make an effort to keep on good terms with Greasy Sae. She’s the only
one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild dog. We don’t hunt
them on purpose, but if you’re attacked and you take out a dog or two,
well, meat is meat. “Once it’s in the soup, I’ll call it beef,” Greasy
Sae says with a wink. No one in the Seam would turn up their nose at a
good leg of wild dog, but the Peacekeepers who come to the Hob can
afford to be a little choosier.</p>
<p>When we finish our business at the market, we go to the back door of
the mayor’s house to sell half the strawberries, knowing he has a
particular fondness for them and can afford our price. The mayor’s
daughter, Madge, opens the door. She’s in my year at school. Being the
mayor’s daughter, you’d expect her to be a snob, but she’s all right.
She just keeps to herself. Like me. Since neither of us really has a
group of friends, we seem to end up together a lot at school. Eating
lunch, sitting next to each other at assemblies, partnering for sports
activities. We rarely talk, which suits us both just fine.</p>
<p>Today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an expensive white
dress, and her blonde hair is done up with a pink ribbon. Reaping
clothes.</p>
<p>“Pretty dress,” says Gale.</p>
<p>Madge shoots him a look, trying to see if it’s a genuine compliment
or if he’s just being ironic. It is a pretty dress, but she would never
be wearing it ordinarily. She presses her lips together and then smiles.
“Well, if I end up going to the Capitol, I want to look nice, don’t
I?”</p>
<p>Now it’s Gale’s turn to be confused. Does she mean it? Or is she
messing with him? I’m guessing the second.</p>
<p>“You won’t be going to the Capitol,” says Gale coolly. His eyes land
on a small, circular pin that adorns her dress. Real gold. Beautifully
crafted. It could keep a family in bread for months. “What can you have?
Five entries? I had six when I was just twelve years old.”</p>
<p>“That’s not her fault,” I say.</p>
<p>“No, it’s no one’s fault. Just the way it is,” says Gale.</p>
<p>Madge’s face has become closed off. She puts the money for the
berries in my hand. “Good luck, Katniss.”</p>
<p>“You, too,” I say, and the door closes.</p>
<p>We walk toward the Seam in silence. I don’t like that Gale took a dig
at Madge, but he’s right, of course. The reaping system is unfair, with
the poor getting the worst of it. You become eligible for the reaping
the day you turn twelve. That year, your name is entered once. At
thirteen, twice. And so on and so on until you reach the age of
eighteen, the final year of eligibility, when your name goes into the
pool seven times. That’s true for every citizen in all twelve districts
in the entire country of Panem.</p>
<p>But here’s the catch. Say you are poor and starving as we were. You
can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae. Each
tessera is worth a meager year’s supply of grain and oil for one person.
You may do this for each of your family members as well. So, at the age
of twelve, I had my name entered four times. Once, because I had to, and
three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my
mother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. And the entries
are cumulative. So now, at the age of sixteen, my name will be in the
reaping twenty times. Gale, who is eighteen and has been either helping
or single-handedly feeding a family of five for seven years, will have
his name in forty-two times.</p>
<p>You can see why someone like Madge, who has never been at risk of
needing a tessera, can set him off. The chance of her name being drawn
is very slim compared to those of us who live in the Seam. Not
impossible, but slim. And even though the rules were set up by the
Capitol, not the districts, certainly not Madge’s family, it’s hard not
to resent those who don’t have to sign up for tesserae.</p>
<p>Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On other days, deep in
the woods, I’ve listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just
another tool to cause misery in our district. A way to plant hatred
between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally
count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another.
“It’s to the Capitol’s advantage to have us divided among ourselves,” he
might say if there were no ears to hear but mine. If it wasn’t reaping
day. If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what I’m
sure she thought was a harmless comment.</p>
<p>As we walk, I glance over at Gale’s face, still smoldering underneath
his stony expression. His rages seem pointless to me, although I never
say so. It’s not that I don’t agree with him. I do. But what good is
yelling about the Capitol in the middle of the woods? It doesn’t change
anything. It doesn’t make things fair. It doesn’t fill our stomachs. In
fact, it scares off the nearby game. I let him yell though. Better he
does it in the woods than in the district.</p>
<p>Gale and I divide our spoils, leaving two fish, a couple of loaves of
good bread, greens, a quart of strawberries, salt, paraffin, and a bit
of money for each.</p>
<p>“See you in the square,” I say.</p>
<p>“Wear something pretty,” he says flatly.</p>
<p>At home, I find my mother and sister are ready to go. My mother wears
a fine dress from her apothecary days. Prim is in my first reaping
outfit, a skirt and ruffled blouse. It’s a bit big on her, but my mother
has made it stay with pins. Even so, she’s having trouble keeping the
blouse tucked in at the back.</p>
<p>A tub of warm water waits for me. I scrub off the dirt and sweat from
the woods and even wash my hair. To my surprise, my mother has laid out
one of her own lovely dresses for me. A soft blue thing with matching
shoes.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” I ask. I’m trying to get past rejecting offers of
help from her. For a while, I was so angry, I wouldn’t allow her to do
anything for me. And this is something special. Her clothes from her
past are very precious to her.</p>
<p>“Of course. Let’s put your hair up, too,” she says. I let her
towel-dry it and braid it up on my head. I can hardly recognize myself
in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall.</p>
<p>“You look beautiful,” says Prim in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>“And nothing like myself,” I say. I hug her, because I know these
next few hours will be terrible for her. Her first reaping. She’s about
as safe as you can get, since she’s only entered once. I wouldn’t let
her take out any tesserae. But she’s worried about me. That the
unthinkable might happen.</p>
<p>I protect Prim in every way I can, but I’m powerless against the
reaping. The anguish I always feel when she’s in pain wells up in my
chest and threatens to register on my face. I notice her blouse has
pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm.
“Tuck your tail in, little duck,” I say, smoothing the blouse back in
place.</p>
<p>Prim giggles and gives me a small “Quack.”</p>
<p>“Quack yourself,” I say with a light laugh. The kind only Prim can
draw out of me. “Come on, let’s eat,” I say and plant a quick kiss on
the top of her head.</p>
<p>The fish and greens are already cooking in a stew, but that will be
for supper. We decide to save the strawberries and bakery bread for this
evening’s meal, to make it special we say. Instead we drink milk from
Prim’s goat, Lady, and eat the rough bread made from the tessera grain,
although no one has much appetite anyway.</p>
<p>At one o’clock, we head for the square. Attendance is mandatory
unless you are on death’s door. This evening, officials will come around
and check to see if this is the case. If not, you’ll be imprisoned.</p>
<p>It’s too bad, really, that they hold the reaping in the square — one
of the few places in District 12 that can be pleasant. The square’s
surrounded by shops, and on public market days, especially if there’s
good weather, it has a holiday feel to it. But today, despite the bright
banners hanging on the buildings, there’s an air of grimness. The camera
crews, perched like buzzards on rooftops, only add to the effect.</p>
<p>People file in silently and sign in. The reaping is a good
opportunity for the Capitol to keep tabs on the population as well.
Twelve- through eighteen-year-olds are herded into roped areas marked
off by ages, the oldest in the front, the young ones, like Prim, toward
the back. Family members line up around the perimeter, holding tightly
to one another’s hands. But there are others, too, who have no one they
love at stake, or who no longer care, who slip among the crowd, taking
bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn. Odds are given on their
ages, whether they’re Seam or merchant, if they will break down and
weep. Most refuse dealing with the racketeers but carefully, carefully.
These same people tend to be informers, and who hasn’t broken the law? I
could be shot on a daily basis for hunting, but the appetites of those
in charge protect me. Not everyone can claim the same.</p>
<p>Anyway, Gale and I agree that if we have to choose between dying of
hunger and a bullet in the head, the bullet would be much quicker.</p>
<p>The space gets tighter, more claustrophobic as people arrive. The
square’s quite large, but not enough to hold District 12’s population of
about eight thousand. Latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets,
where they can watch the event on screens as it’s televised live by the
state.</p>
<p>I find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the Seam. We all
exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the temporary stage that
is set up before the Justice Building. It holds three chairs, a podium,
and two large glass balls, one for the boys and one for the girls. I
stare at the paper slips in the girls’ ball. Twenty of them have Katniss
Everdeen written on them in careful handwriting.</p>
<p>Two of the three chairs fill with Madge’s father, Mayor Undersee,
who’s a tall, balding man, and Effie Trinket, District 12’s escort,
fresh from the Capitol with her scary white grin, pinkish hair, and
spring green suit. They murmur to each other and then look with concern
at the empty seat.</p>
<p>Just as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to the podium
and begins to read. It’s the same story every year. He tells of the
history of Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place
that was once called North America. He lists the disasters, the
droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up
so much of the land, the brutal war for what little sustenance remained.
The result was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts,
which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the Dark
Days, the uprising of the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were
defeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty of Treason gave us the
new laws to guarantee peace and, as our yearly reminder that the Dark
Days must never be repeated, it gave us the Hunger Games.</p>
<p>The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment for the
uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one
boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be
imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a
burning desert to a frozen wasteland. Over a period of several weeks,
the competitors must fight to the death. The last tribute standing
wins.</p>
<p>Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one another
while we watch — this is the Capitol’s way of reminding us how totally
we are at their mercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving
another rebellion. Whatever words they use, the real message is clear.
“Look how we take your children and sacrifice them and there’s nothing
you can do. If you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you.
Just as we did in District Thirteen.”</p>
<p>To make it humiliating as well as torturous, the Capitol requires us
to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity, a sporting event pitting every
district against the others. The last tribute alive receives a life of
ease back home, and their district will be showered with prizes, largely
consisting of food. All year, the Capitol will show the winning district
gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of
us battle starvation.</p>
<p>“It is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks,” intones the
mayor.</p>
<p>Then he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In seventy-four
years, we have had exactly two. Only one is still alive. Haymitch
Abernathy, a paunchy, middle-aged man, who at this moment appears
hollering something unintelligible, staggers onto the stage, and falls
into the third chair. He’s drunk. Very. The crowd responds with its
token applause, but he’s confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big
hug, which she barely manages to fend off.</p>
<p>The mayor looks distressed. Since all of this is being televised,
right now District 12 is the laughingstock of Panem, and he knows it. He
quickly tries to pull the attention back to the reaping by introducing
Effie Trinket.</p>
<p>Bright and bubbly as ever, Effie Trinket trots to the podium and
gives her signature, “Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in
your favor!” Her pink hair must be a wig because her curls have shifted
slightly off-center since her encounter with Haymitch. She goes on a bit
about what an honor it is to be here, although everyone knows she’s just
aching to get bumped up to a better district where they have proper
victors, not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation.</p>
<p>Through the crowd, I spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a
smile. As reapings go, this one at least has a slight entertainment
factor. But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and his forty-two names in
that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor. Not compared
to a lot of the boys. And maybe he’s thinking the same thing about me
because his face darkens and he turns away. “But there are still
thousands of slips,” I wish I could whisper to him.</p>
<p>It’s time for the drawing. Effie Trinket says as she always does,
“Ladies first!” and crosses to the glass ball with the girls’ names. She
reaches in, digs her hand deep into the ball, and pulls out a slip of
paper. The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a
pin drop, and I’m feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that it’s
not me, that it’s not me, that it’s not me.</p>
<p>Effie Trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes the slip of paper,
and reads out the name in a clear voice. And it’s not me.</p>
<p>It’s Primrose Everdeen.</p>
<p>My dear friend and creative collaborator, James Proimos, passed away
on July 8, 2024, as I was finishing up this novel. Both an amazing
artist and writer, his delightfully funny and inventive books encourage
his audience to consider building a kinder and gentler world, one
cupcake at a time. My personal favorites include The Many Adventures of
Johnny Mutton, Joe’s Wish, and Paulie Pastrami Achieves World Peace.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure The Hunger Games wouldn’t exist without Jim (which is
why the first book is dedicated to him). We met on Generation O!, an
animated TV show that he cocreated. Jim thought I should be an author
and repeatedly encouraged me to give it a try. He said to write
something, anything, and then he’d do a few drawings for it and his
agent, Rosemary Stimola, would have to look at it. So that’s how it
started. Neither the ABC or counting books we attempted ever found a
home — although Jim’s art was fantastic. But they gave me enough of a
connection to Rosemary that on the morning I woke up in a state of
excitement with the idea for Gregor the Overlander, I felt comfortable
calling her at an inappropriately early hour and pitching it. The rest
unfolded from there. It seems unlikely that I would’ve found my way to
books without Jim, and I will always be grateful to him for opening that
door and quietly and persistently nudging me through it.</p>
<p>Jim was one of the truly original thinkers it has been my privilege
to work with. We collaborated on a number of TV projects, but only one
other book. I had been struggling to find a way to transform my memories
of the year my dad was deployed to Vietnam into a picture book. Over a
casual lunch, I started telling Jim the story. As he responded, I began
to see it come to life with his art, not dark and heavy-handed but
through the eyes of a six-year-old. Year of the Jungle was a tough story
for me to tell, far more personal than my usual writing, and having an
empathetic and trusted friend by my side gave me the courage to explore
it. His incredible art, which transforms the jungle from a magical
playground to a terrifying nightmare while maintaining a childlike
visual style, made the book possible.</p>
<p>For the encouragement, for the jungle, and for the many years of your
kindness, humor, patience, talent, and friendship, thank you, Jim. At
this point, I think it’s safe to say, “We will never drift apart.”</p>
<p>In addition, I’d like to thank my gander and first reader, Cap Pryor;
my son, Charlie; and my aforementioned agent, Rosemary, for their
impactful early response to this book. Good friends Richard Register and
Michael Arndt also gave invaluable support and input on the story.</p>
<p>Coming home to Scholastic is always a joy. Deep appreciation once
again for my editorial director, David Levithan, who has always been so
generous in sharing his extraordinary authorial expertise; my first and
always editor, Kate Egan, who has beautifully advised me from the first
Gregor book; the responsive Emily Seife, whose heartfelt emotional notes
gave me a much needed boost when my batteries were running low; our
terrific copy editor, Joy Simpkins, for catching what the rest of us do
not; and Elizabeth Parisi and Tim O’Brien for another gorgeous
cover.</p>
<p>A big shout-out to the rest of my fabulous publishing family: the
late, great Dick Robinson, Iole Lucchese, Peter Warwick, Ellie Berger,
Rachel Coun, Lizette Serrano, Tracy van Straaten, Katy Coyle, Madeline
Muschalik, Mark Seidenfeld, Leslie Garych, Erin O’Connor, JoAnne Mojica,
Melissa Schirmer, Maeve Norton, Bonnie Cutler, Nelson Gómez, Lauren
Fortune, Paul Gagne, Andrea Davis Pinkney, Billy DiMichele, and the
entire Scholastic sales force.</p>
<p>A note about the songs: “The Raven” by Edgar Allan Poe was first
published in 1845. “Ah! Sun-flower” by William Blake appeared in his
Songs of Experience in 1794. “The Goose and the Common” was written by
an unknown author in the seven-teenth or eighteenth century. “Ladybug,
Ladybug” is a District 12 variation of a centuries-old nursery rhyme. I
wrote both “Wiress’s Arena Song” and “The Harvest Song” for this story.
“The Happy Birthday Song” and “Gem of Panem” first appeared in the novel
The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes; James Newton Howard wrote the music
to the latter for the screen. “The Hanging Tree” lyrics originated in
the book Mockingjay, and the film version was composed by Jeremiah Caleb
Fraites andandandand Wesley Keith Schultz of the Lumineers and arranged
by James Newton Howard. “Nothing You Can Take From Me,” “The Ballad of
Lucy Gray Baird,” and “The Old Therebefore” all first appeared in the
Ballad novel and Dave Cobb wrote their music for the film. Much
gratitude goes to all these artists, from long ago to the present, whose
brilliant, whimsical, and soulful works have enriched Panem.</p>
<p>Managing this fictional world is a complex and ever-growing job. To
Rosemary; my entertainment agent, Jason Dravis; legal experts Eleanor
Lackman, Diane Golden, and Sarah Lerner; and my daughter, Izzy, who
keeps the District 12 office in shape — thanks for the super job you do
making sure everything runs smoothly.</p>
<p>I wish my dad was here to see that our discussions on David Hume
inspired Sunrise on the Reaping, and I hope my English-major mom, who
shares her love of literature with me, enjoys this story. Much love
always to you both.</p>
<p>To all my wonderful readers, thanks for once again returning to Panem
and investing in these characters and their struggles, even when you
know the eventual outcome. The snow may fall, but the sun also
rises.</p>
