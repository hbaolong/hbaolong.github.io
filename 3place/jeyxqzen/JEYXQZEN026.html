<h4 id="chapter-25">Chapter 25</h4>
<p>Drip. Drip. Drip.</p>
<p>“Ma must have hung the laundry inside.”</p>
<p>Drip. Drip. Drip.</p>
<p>“So cold. Need to put some coal on the fire. So cold. Where’s my
quilt? Sid, you got my quilt?”</p>
<p>Drip. Drip. Drip.</p>
<p>“Hattie bottling a new batch. Always stinks like this. First part of
the run gets tossed. ‘Throw out the heads, Haymitch. Stuff will kill
you. It’ll kill you.’”</p>
<p>Drip. Drip. Drip.</p>
<p>“Too late, Hattie. I’m already dead. Hey, Hattie?”</p>
<p>Drip. Drip. Drip.</p>
<p>“Hattie? Ma?” There’s no response. Something bad is happening.
“Ma?”</p>
<p>I snap awake. Why is Hattie brewing in my kitchen? Get us all
arrested. Why will no one answer me? This isn’t the kitchen. What the
hell is happening? Why do I hurt so bad?</p>
<p>A greenish tornado sky glow. The sharp alcohol smell married with
chemicals lining my nose, coating my tongue. Drip-drip-dripping mixed
with a distant murmur, words I cannot quite make out. Cold metal pinning
me to cold metal. Fear.</p>
<p>I blink hard and the world comes into focus. Through the swampy
light, a high ceiling crisscrossed with pipes. I lick my sandpaper lips,
try to swallow. Reach to rub my eyes, but my hands can’t make it past my
belly. Fingers find the long row of stitches across my gut. Can’t make
sense of them. A steel table beneath me. No mattress or sheet or pillow.
Metal cuffs with short chains on my wrists and ankles. Strap across my
chest. Naked as a jaybird. Not a stitch. No, but something left. My
flint striker . . .</p>
<p>The memory swoops back into my brain. The cliffside. The bomb.
Silka’s dying gurgles. The warnings from above. Sparks flying. Fuse
catching. The arc of the sunflower against the open sky. Then, that
earsplitting sound.</p>
<p>I must be dead. I felt my intestines sliding out. My body shutting
down. I wanted to go. The job was done, my poster completed.</p>
<p>What’s happened to me?</p>
<p>My flint striker rests on my heart, as it did in my final moment,
only now it’s fastened to my neck by the leather bootlace. Someone has
tied it there, and it wasn’t Ma.</p>
<p>Where am I, Lenore Dove? Where are you, my only love?</p>
<p>Tubes sprout from my arms. One in my belly. I twist my head to the
right and pain scalds my gut. A few feet away, faces press against a
glass wall. Tongueless mouths open. Avoxes, unclothed and dirty, paw the
glass, begging me for something I can’t give. Terrified, I turn to the
left.</p>
<p>A moment of relief as I spot my old friend, the gray rabbit from the
arena. My dove in the coal mine, who warned of danger, who led me from
the maze. Has it come to save me once again? Help me. Can you help me?
The green eyes stare unblinking from the tank. It presses into the
glass. Why does it tremble so?</p>
<p>From the shadows, something strikes. A six-foot snake swallows up my
ally. A lump in the sinewy body.</p>
<p>I slam my eyes shut. This must be a nightmare. Or perhaps I’ve gone
to another world, a bad one. I try to will myself back into
unconsciousness, to escape this evil place. But in my heart of hearts, I
know it’s real. I start shaking as hard as the rabbit. Harder. Awaiting
my snake. Please send the snake and end this.</p>
<p>Muffled footsteps. A tug on my tubes. A woman in a mask swaps a full
bag of clear fluid for an empty one.</p>
<p>“Where am I?” I rasp. She ignores me. Just sponges my gut stitches
with a foul-smelling liquid, sending shocks of pain across my trunk.
“Stop! You’re hurting me!” I struggle. She doesn’t stop. I stop, because
moving makes the pain worse.</p>
<p>She leaves. Murmurs again. This time I catch a few words.
“Laboratory.” “Sepsis.” “Disruptive.” A coldness surges from the needle
planted in my arm. Nothingness.</p>
<p>When I wake again, I have new knowledge. In this place, disruption
brings oblivion. Dispensed from afar like the drugs in Lou Lou’s pump. I
try to be as disruptive as possible for the hours? days? weeks? I am
imprisoned here. When I’m conscious, the Avoxes plead. Padded feet bring
pain. Grotesque mutts replace the humans. More bunnies die. Nasty
concoctions are forced between my lips. No daylight breaches the walls,
no ally comforts me. I am utterly alone and defenseless.</p>
<p>Fresh confusion as I surface in a nest of burnt orange. Somehow, I’m
back at the tribute apartment. Across the room, Wyatt’s bed, bereft of
covers, catches me off guard. Still haven’t had the space to mourn
him.</p>
<p>Gingerly, I wiggle my fingers and toes. All the tubes and restraints
have vanished, but a pump identical to Lou Lou’s has sunk its teeth deep
into my chest, defying me to remove it. I fold back the fuzzy spread,
the fine sheets, and examine my gut wound. No stitches, just a puckered,
angry scar, like a twisted smile. My thigh has fared better, but I’ll
carry the mark for life. Still naked. I jump up, only to collapse back
down on the bed, gripping the covers as the room spins. I wait for
things to settle before a second attempt. With my feet carefully planted
on the floor, I slowly rise. My pajamas are still in a jumble on the
floor where I left them the morning of the Hunger Games. With no other
options, I put them on.</p>
<p>I wobble into the living room and steady myself against the doorjamb
of the girls’ room. Bedding from our last sleepover drapes the furniture
and floor. Dried blood spots from Lou Lou’s ear dot her pillow.
Maysilee’s pajamas sit folded in a neat pile on her bed. Nobody’s here
because everybody’s dead.</p>
<p>“Mags?” I croak. “Wiress?” No answer. The whole build-ing’s as silent
as a grave. The street outside the apartment, deserted. Locked down.
Block barricaded off. I am indeed a dangerous young man. The charming
rascal turned deadly rebel. Woodbine Chance has grown up into one of his
loose cannon kin, fated to swing by his neck while District 12 looks on.
Seized by an impulse to flee, I make for the elevator and press the
button repeatedly. No humming, no lights, no escape possible.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, the table’s bare, but the refrigerator holds a
platter of rolls and a shelf of pint-sized cartons of milk. Snow’s diet
after the deadly oysters. Though my stomach has shrunk to the size of a
walnut, it still craves food. I dip bits of bread in the milk and suck
them down. Being poisoned no longer worries me. If the president wanted
me dead, why has he gone to so much trouble to keep me alive? He has big
plans for me. The camera in the corner reminds me my every move’s being
watched or at least recorded. No, at this point, definitely watched.
Eyes on me, 24/7. I will not be allowed to die. I will be resurrected by
the Capitol for their entertainment. Perhaps, I am even being broadcast
live now. Perhaps, as a victor, I will never be off camera again. . .
.</p>
<p>Exhausted by my excursion, I return to bed and sink into a fitful
sleep.</p>
<p>Days pass. My schedule’s my own here. Nothing but time to consider
the consequences of my actions in the arena. Snow’s perfect little
showpiece that I undermined every chance I got. I take no pleasure in
that now as I wonder who’s paying the price for it. Beetee. Mags.
Wiress. They’re likely all being tortured to reveal the names of
accomplices. The rebel sympathizers who crafted sunflower bombs and fuse
necklaces. The Gamemakers and Peacekeepers who helped smuggle them in. I
hope they’ve spared the prep team and Effie, who are completely clueless
Capitol pawns. I doubt anyone suspects Drusilla and Magno Stift of being
sympathizers and I don’t care if they do. And Plutarch? I’m still not
sure of his role in all this, but he was right about the sun and the
berms, and without that knowledge, it would have been impossible to
carry out my mission. Is he an ally? A Capitol operative? Both?
Impossible to know.</p>
<p>I don’t dare think about my loved ones back home. Everything I did,
every choice I made, was based on the knowledge that my death protected
them from harm. Snow had guaranteed that in the library. “With you out
of the picture, Lenore Dove and your family should be free to enjoy long
and happy lives.” Like Beeteesaid, if he had died, Ampert would have
still been alive. Snow wanted him to suffer the horror of watching his
son’s execution; it was pointless otherwise. But since Snow needed a
victor for his perfect Quarter Quell, I guess he changed his mind about
killing me.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Beetee’s transgressions were clandestine and
mine were televised to the entire country. Or were they? I have no idea
how my efforts have been edited, blacked out, and card-stacked. It’s
possible that nothing significant has been aired, gutting the
effectiveness of my posters, but perhaps lightening my punishment.</p>
<p>This I know: I have been publicly challenging Snow and his Quarter
Quell since I landed in the Capitol. Even after the private meeting in
the library, I flaunted my defiance of him. If he served up poisoned
oysters to Incitatus Loomy, the parade master, what feast must he have
in store for me and mine?</p>
<p>Maybe a week has gone by, according to the shifting light on the
street. Solitary confinement continues. The isolation is almost scarier
than the creepy lab. You know when you’re starting to miss hanging out
with the mutts, you’re in trouble, but I long for company.</p>
<p>The rolls harden, the milk begins to turn, but I keep eating, driven
by a convalescent’s ravenous appetite. I fantasize about food. Fresh
plums. Mashed potatoes. Rabbit stew. Stack cake. Will I ever taste stack
cake again? Unlikely. If I do make it home, I expect childhood
celebrations will be a thing of the past. I won’t really be home anyway.
I’ll have a house in the Victor’s Village, with all the niceties Beetee
alluded to. Reliable electricity, warm and cool air, flushing toilets,
and all the hot water I want at the turn of a faucet. No pumping and
chopping required. Like my prison here.</p>
<p>Perhaps my victory celebration has been canceled due to my
insurrection. Maybe I’m just being imprisoned for my public execution.
One can hope.</p>
<p>I start spending long stretches in the tub. The towel I threw over
the camera’s been removed and I don’t bother replacing it. They’d just
drug me and take it away. Might chain me up again. No point. I soak for
hours and hours, replenishing the hot water, watching my fingers and
toes get pruney as bits of dead flesh float off my scar. Images of the
arena consume me. Death upon death. Ones I didn’t witness, like the
bloodbath, I imagine. I try to recall the other forty-seven tributes
plus Lou Lou. Using Maysilee’s color system helps a bit, but about half
elude me. District 5, District 8. All but forgotten.</p>
<p>Wyatt’s absence haunts me in the bedroom, so I take my spread to the
couch and make camp there. The television, unresponsive to my attempts
with the remote, begins to turn on and off on its own. I’m fed clips
from old Hunger Games, curated especially for me. Gory snippets,
terrorized children, despair. The early ones, which they rarely feature
on Capitol TV, are low-budget affairs with no attempt at the showiness
that marks today’s extravaganzas. Just a bunch of kids thrown into an
old arena with some weapons. No costumes or interviews.</p>
<p>One evening, a haunting melody weaves through my dreams. I startle
from sleep, calling Lenore Dove’s name. The television glows. On-screen,
a girl in a rainbow of ruffles sings a familiar tune with unfamiliar
words.</p>
<p>It’s sooner than later that I’m six feet under.</p>
<p>It’s sooner than later that you’ll be alone.</p>
<p>So who will you turn to tomorrow, I wonder?</p>
<p>For when the bell rings, lover, you’re on your own.</p>
<p>She performs on a stage with a shabby backdrop before a Capitol
audience in old-fashioned clothes. Great-Aunt Messalina and Great-Uncle
Silius would fit right in.</p>
<p>Her voice, that accent, the way those fingers command the guitar
strings — a Covey girl, for sure. But not mine . . .</p>
<p>And I am the one who you let see you weeping.</p>
<p>I know the soul that you struggle to save.</p>
<p>Too bad I’m the bet that you lost in the reaping.</p>
<p>Now what will you do when I go to my grave?</p>
<p>Sniffles from the audience. Someone shouts, “Bravo!” The crowd goes
wild. The girl bows and extends her hand to a figure who’s standing just
out of the spotlight. A silhouette of a man. Upright, trim. A crown of
curls. He waits a moment, as if deciding whether or not to join her.
Then takes a step forward as the screen goes black.</p>
<p>The reaping, she said? Must be. Why else would a Covey girl be in the
Capitol? Could this girl be District 12’s one and only victor? Suddenly,
I’m sure she is. No wonder Lenore Dove never wants to talk about her.
She knows the story, but it’s too secret, or perhaps too painful, to
share even with me. I think about the bits of color Lenore Dove adds to
her wardrobe, the bright blue, yellow, and pink. Are they scraps from
this girl’s dress? A way to keep her memory alive? What color name did
this rainbow girl carry to the Tenth Hunger Games? What happened to her
after? Did she come home? Did she die in the nightmarish lab? What did
she do to be erased so completely?</p>
<p>Who was the guy she reached out to at the end of her number? Her
district partner possibly, who’d have died in the arena. It was someone
she cared about, from the look of it. Or perhaps it was someone else,
someone hosting the show. An earlier Flickerman. They’d be forty years
older now if they’re still alive.</p>
<p>Forty years. Not all that long after the Dark Days. If District 12’s
forgotten her, it’s unlikely she’s remembered here in the Capitol. No,
wait. Someone here remembers the Covey. Someone who knows how they name
their babies and love their birds. Intimate, personal knowledge. The
information I attributed to Capitol informers could have an entirely
different source. I do the math. Fifty-eight minus forty. Eighteen.
President Snow would’ve been eighteen during the Tenth Hunger Games. The
Covey girl would have been no older. The curly-headed man in the shadows
that she reached out to . . . was it him?</p>
<p>I recall the library, his knowing smirk . . .</p>
<p>“Bet I know a thing or two about your dove.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Like she’s delightful to look at, swishes around in bright colors,
and sings like a mockingjay. You love her. And oh, how she seems to love
you. Except sometimes you wonder because her plans don’t seem to include
you at all.”</p>
<p>Oh, Lenore Dove, what have I done to you? How will you pay for my
surviving the Hunger Games?</p>
<p>I lose it, smashing a chair into the window, shattering glass onto a
table of china kittens, then pounding at the bars with a heavy lamp. I
hammer away until a burst of bullets above my head breaks my focus.</p>
<p>A pair of heavily armed Peacekeepers has materialized, their rifles
trained on me. Behind them, my prep team huddles and would likely flee
if Effie Trinket didn’t have a firm grip on their grooming belts.
“Well,” she says with false cheeriness, “who’s ready for a big, big, big
night?”</p>
<p>The Peacekeepers slap on handcuffs and propel me into the center of
the room, where my prep team stares at me, aghast. I’m skin and bones,
wearing dirty pajamas, and my bare feet bleed freely from the broken
glass. Somewhere in the last few weeks, my nails have turned to claws,
my hair to fur. I’ve killed multiple times and preserved no life but my
own. I left a simple district piglet and returned as the murderous beast
that they always suspected lay in wait.</p>
<p>“Just need a flower for my lapel,” I say.</p>
<p>But you can’t keep Effie down. She holds up a white rose. “Got it.
Why don’t we start with a shower? You’ll want to look your best for your
Victor’s Ceremony.”</p>
<p>No execution, then. At least, not yet.</p>
<p>Soaped up, rinsed off, trimmed, shaved, teeth brushed, feet bandaged.
Revulsion at my scar expressed and dealt with, the team dresses me in
another Uncle Silius ensemble.</p>
<p>I finger the champagne bubbles embroidered in the jacket. “Where’s
Magno Stift?”</p>
<p>Effie’s nose wrinkles in disgust. “More toads. He’s still recovering,
but he’s planning to make an appearance tonight since you’re the
victor.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to tell everyone you dressed me.”</p>
<p>“Please, don’t.” She sighs. “He’ll only make a scene, and it’s hard
enough being a Trinket.” She arranges my flint striker over my shirt. I
try to shove it back under my collar, but she resists. “He said to keep
it out, where everybody can see it.”</p>
<p>“Magno did?” I ask Effie.</p>
<p>“No.” She clips off the end of the rose, slides it into a buttonhole
and gives it a tap. “He did.” She steps back. “You look very
presentable. Remember, positive attitude.”</p>
<p>Despite my finery, I’m shackled and transported in the van, which
feels so dark and desolate without Maysilee, Wyatt, and Lou Lou. No
greenroom for me this time. Still rattling my chains, I’m escorted
beneath the stage and shoved into a chair, with four guards assigned to
me.</p>
<p>Effie, to her credit, stands by me. When the Peacekeepers object, she
says, “He’s the second Quarter Quell victor. Drusilla and Magno are not
available. Someone should be with him to honor his achievement.”</p>
<p>“Your funeral,” a Peacekeeper says.</p>
<p>I think about the things I did in the arena. Things they definitely
would have shown. Killing the pair from District 4. The brutal ax fight
with Silka. Maybe they’re right to chain me like a beast. I feel
grateful to Effie. “I won’t hurt you,” I mutter.</p>
<p>“I know that,” she says. “I’ve known who you are ever since you
helped with my makeup box. And I know your position could not have been
easy.”</p>
<p>It’s surprisingly touching. “Thanks, Effie.”</p>
<p>“But they really are for a greater good. The Hunger Games.”</p>
<p>And now she’s lost me.</p>
<p>The area beneath the stage begins to fill with people and their
handlers. The activity centers around five metal plates that will ascend
with the featured players of the night. Proserpina and Vitus jitter on
one circle in anticipation, tweaking each other’s makeup. Drusilla, who
appears to be wearing a stuffed eagle on her head, teeters on six-inch
heels. Magno reels in, decked in live-reptile fashion, and a few
assistants balance him on his spot, with crossed fingers. I crane my
neck, trying to find my mentors. Finally, Mags arrives in a wheelchair
while a still-mobile but distressed Wiress twitches her head about in a
birdlike fashion, a steady stream of words spouting from her lips. Very
bad things have been done to them. Mags spots me and tries to rise
before she’s shoved back in her chair. No reunion for us.</p>
<p>Their torturous treatment makes it impossible to deny my family’s
certain punishment. Are they already dead? Or will Snow arrange, as he
did with Beetee, for a time when I can personally witness their
suffering?</p>
<p>The anthem plays and I hear Caesar Flickerman welcome the audience to
the second Quarter Quell’s Victor’s Ceremony. He calls the Games
historic, unparalleled, unforgettable, and as devastating a reminder of
the Dark Days as the country has ever witnessed. He begins to introduce
my team as a hubbub of shouting and whooping comes from the audience. Up
go Proserpina and Vitus, clapping for themselves. Drusilla follows, in a
dramatic pose that mimics the eagle’s outstretched wings. As his plate
rises, Magno almost tumbles off, but catches himself and crawls back
aboard. He makes his entrance on one knee, his hands in a victory clasp
above his head. The Peacekeepers haul Mags to her feet. She and Wiress,
arms encircling each other’s waists, lean against each other for
support.</p>
<p>Freed of my shackles, I’m held in place on my plate until it begins
to rise. What did the audience see during the Hunger Games? Will they
boo or applaud for me? And who am I supposed to be? Is it possible I’m
still a beloved rascal? Or are they salivating to see the murderous
monster from District 12? Effie Trinket, the only one I might ask, has
melted into the shadows.</p>
<p>I brace myself, preparing to be pelted with rotten fruit or jeered
off the stage. Bright lights partially blind me, and I lift my hand to
shield my eyes. When they adjust, I realize the entire audience has
given me a standing ovation. Mad cheers and hot tears.</p>
<p>I’m the hero of the moment. The star of Panem. The victor of the
Quarter Quell. And that can only mean that President Snow has won the
day.</p>
<p>People in the crowd begin to chant a mishmash of sounds that reduce
to “Show it! Show it! Show it! Show it!”</p>
<p>I turn to Caesar for direction and he draws a line across his
abdomen. My scar. They want me to show them my scar. There appears to be
no choice. I pull my silk shirt up, unzip my pants as far as modesty
allows, and display my scar. The applause lasts for a full five
minutes.</p>
<p>Giant screens throughout the auditorium come to life with the anthem
playing over a fluttering flag of Panem. Caesar guides me to an
upholstered chair positioned in the center of the stage for the recap.
It is my first glimpse into how my Hunger Games were broadcast to the
public.</p>
<p>The recap opens on the reading of the card, which I watched from home
with Ma and Sid in the spring. A little girl dressed all in white, the
picture of innocence, lifts the lid on a wooden box filled with
envelopes. They widen the shot to include President Snow, who intones,
“And now, to honor our second Quarter Quell, we respect the wishes of
those who risked all to bring peace to our great nation.” He leans over
and carefully selects the envelope marked with a 50 and reads the card
inside. “On the fiftieth anniversary, as a reminder that two rebels died
for each Capitol citizen, every district will be required to send twice
as many tributes to the Hunger Games. Two female and two male. In this
doubling of reparations, we remember that true strength lies not in
numbers, but in righteousness.”</p>
<p>Bam! They start drawing the names at the reapings, beginning with
District 1. “Silka Sharp!” “Panache Barker!” They machine-gun through
the tributes with a quick shot of each and a counter in the corner of
the screen that tracks from one to forty-eight. Being the home of the
victor, District 12 is allowed a bit more time. Drusilla, yellow hat
feathers bobbing, gets in her “Ladies first!” before “Louella McCoy!” My
sweetheart marches up. “Maysilee Donner!” There’s Maysilee, Merrilee,
and Asterid clutching one another in the crowd. One of the tearful
good-byes captured by Plutarch. “And the first gentleman who gets to
accompany the ladies is . . . Wyatt Callow!” They briefly cover Wyatt,
and then Drusilla calls my name. Lenore Dove’s refusal to perform has
not made this version. Not tearful enough for Plutarch and too Covey for
Snow. But there’s no Ma or Sid either. The omission chills me. Why isn’t
Plutarch’s footage here? “Ladies and gentlemen, join me in welcoming the
District Twelve tributes of the Fiftieth Hunger Games!” says Drusilla,
as if daring District 12 to do anything else. “And may the odds be EVER
in your favor!” I’m obliterated by a swirl of confetti.</p>
<p>I want to scream out the truth. A boy’s head was blown off! People in
12 were shot! My reaping was rigged! But I just sit there, mute and
radiating implicit submission. Snow has me by the short hairs and he
knows it.</p>
<p>Incitatus Loomy could not have masterminded a finer parade. The
frantic backstage prep never makes an appearance, just a majestic,
orderly rollout of the tributes. There’s a final aerial shot of all
twelve chariots cruising along the route in perfect sync, which ends
about fifteen seconds before that blue firecracker exploded, sending the
whole event into chaos. This is all the country saw anyway. You had to
be there in person to know about the crashing chariots and me holding
Snow accountable for Louella’s death. Which, as we know, also didn’t
happen because, look, it’s time for the interviews and all forty-eight
tributes are in the house.</p>
<p>The Careers have been edited to appear smarter, the Newcomers less
unified. Does anyone even notice this besides me? Lou Lou’s reduced to a
girl wearing live-reptile fashion, Maysilee’s and Wyatt’s memorable
turns are entirely ignored, and I get one snarky exchange with
Caesar:</p>
<p>“So, Haymitch, what do you think of the Games having one hundred
percent more competitors than usual?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see that it makes much difference. They’ll still be one
hundred percent as stupid as usual, so I figure my odds will be roughly
the same.”</p>
<p>The audience laughs, and I give them this grin that confirms me as a
stuck-up, selfish jerk. No mention of my support of the Newcomers. No
silly interplay about making booze for Peacekeepers. The rascal’s just a
jackass.</p>
<p>Now we’re rising into the arena. The opening sequence is a love
letter to the Gamemakers as we savor the beauty of flora and fauna. For
me, though, it calls to mind the deceptively sweet, brain-clouding smell
of the air.</p>
<p>The jackass, meaning me, grabs his gear and hightails it out of there
and then we get to watch the bloodbath, where eighteen kids are killed
in excruciating detail. The audience before me gasps and cries out in
glee, though they’ve seen it all before. Wyatt dies a selfless hero
protecting a bewildered Lou Lou, who manages to scamper off unscathed.
Maysilee fights, then follows Lou Lou to protect her. So many Newcomers
fall. Two doves, the boys from 7, all of 8 and 9, Lannie and the other
girl from 10, Tile from 11. With Wyatt, that makes sixteen. The only
Career casualties are a boy and girl from District 5. Eighteen in
all.</p>
<p>Oh, hello again, jackass! Sure, take your time. Catch your breath on
the rock. Check out your pack. Don’t worry about the Newcomers, they’ve
got this. Ooh, look at that pretty woods. Have a nice hike!</p>
<p>A bunch of us sicken as the poisonous fruit and water kicks in. Carat
from 1 and Urchin, the boy from 4 who knocked me off the chariot, writhe
to death. That accounts for the twenty kids I saw in the sky that first
night. The rest of the Careers have formed their pack on the snow-capped
mountain.</p>
<p>Up until this point, I think the recap’s been a fair record of what
occurred in the arena. However, on Day 2, things start to go wonky. At
some point, Maysilee, on her own, kills the boy from District 1, Loupe,
which I believe to be true because she told me this. There are a lot of
tributes still recovering from the poison and the Career pack’s hunting
Newcomers. That, too, seems likely. But the recount of what happened in
the woods, my tale, begins to deviate almost immediately. Timelines are
twisted. Connections misleading. It’s less flat-out lying than lying by
omission. For instance, I see myself fighting squirrels, although they
weren’t around until the third day when I fought them to save Ampert.
But we haven’t even met up yet, so I seem to be trying to save my own
life. They show Lou Lou gasping in the flowers, only I’m nowhere in
sight. Later, I’m just running from the butterflies without even a
glimpse of my fleeing with her body, hiding in the willows, and bringing
on the shockers as punishment. What they showed during the actual Games,
I don’t know, but in the recap, I’m not even attempting to protect any
of my allies. Day 3, the squirrels, as if making a second appearance,
swarm Ampert, and then there’s a reveal of his skeleton on the ground.
Again, I’m nowhere to be found. In fact, our picnic, the campout, the
bombing of the tank, my rampage, and the arena going haywire — not a bit
of that appears.</p>
<p>The horrors of the volcano take center stage. The tributes experience
the flame-shooting eruption, asphyxiation by the ash cloud, burns from
the chemical lava. Twelve die. The rest barely escape and head across
the meadow to the woods.</p>
<p>Cut to me, waking up blanketed by the sparkling ash. I get back to
the business of trudging north. With the tank plot erased, my whole
agenda seems to have been about getting to the end of the arena, which
was, I guess, my cover story. It rains, but they’ve concealed all the
bombing’s damage. The arena’s as perfect as ever. I get trapped in the
hedge, follow the gray rabbit to freedom, and run into Panache and
company.</p>
<p>I don’t know who that is on the screen, so brutally killing those
Careers from District 4. I guess it’s me, but I can’t own it. I stop
thinking of myself as the jackass because it seems too complimentary for
the creature I’ve devolved into. Doesn’t help when they show every
syllable of my toadying, babbling speech to Panache, who is finally
silenced by Maysilee’s dart.</p>
<p>“We’d live longer with two of us.” Oh, Maysilee. I am mortified to be
sitting here.</p>
<p>For a bit, things get back on course again. Maysilee and I look out
for each other, and Silka and Maritte take out Ringina and Autumn in
combat. But in a mind-bending realignment of events, Maysilee and me
drawing off the porcupine mutt and Maritte and Maysilee killing the
three Gamemakers at the berm have vanished. Somewhere in time, Maritte
and Silka chase us through the woods, and Buck, Chicory, and Hull die
from the quills, but it appears the porcupine just wanders off on its
own.</p>
<p>Is it Day 4 or 5? Maysilee and my attempts to carve our way through
the hedge have merged into one big sequence that involves the ladybugs
and blowtorch. We’re on the cliff that looks down on the treacherous
rocks, but they steer clear of the generator. They’ve edited out the
cannon announcing Maritte’s death and with it the part where Maysilee
says she’s just going back for the potatoes, so it looks like we’ve
really decided to split up. To my surprise, they keep my discovery of
the force field. I guess they need it for Silka’s death?</p>
<p>The pink birds attack Maysilee and she screams. For the first time, I
look like I might be redeemable because I run to her aid. Oh, no. They
haven’t turned this into a redemption story, have they? Selfish rascal
learns to care about others? Please tell me no.</p>
<p>Day 5 or 6? Who knows? It’s just one big, big, big day.</p>
<p>My delivery of milk from Snow has evaporated. As I run through the
woods, they’ve added the sound of Wellie screaming, which didn’t happen.
I appear to have finally remembered that I belong to a wider alliance so
I’m going to the rescue, when the cannon sounds and I come upon Silka,
Wellie’s head in hand.</p>
<p>Smash cut to the golden squirrels stripping Maritte to the bone. No
matter that she’s been long dead by this time. But people must know
that. Maysilee and Maritte appeared in the sky together. Does no one
remember? Do they just not care? Or during the Games, did they show the
audience a different sky? Or none at all? And did they intentionally
save Maritte’s death to increase tension at the end? The Gamemakers must
have been scrambling like crazy to control the narrative by this point.
Whatever the case, the audience here in the auditorium has embraced this
version, cheering and jeering on cue. Their lack of discernment
transforms the recap, validating it as truth. I hope those in the
districts can still see it as the piece of propaganda it is, but no
telling what they’ve been fed.</p>
<p>We’re back to Silka and me facing off, knowing we’re the final two.
Without words, we quickly engage in battle. Fatal wounds are exchanged.
I run to the hedge.</p>
<p>On the cliff, Silka corners me, throws her ax. I drop. They cut to
her anticipation and then back to me, convulsing. This must have
happened after I lost consciousness.</p>
<p>The ax rebounds and buries itself in her head. And then? — and
then?</p>
<p>Silka dies, her cannon fires, and I’m hanging on by a thread. The
sunflower bomb, the quartz, the flint striker — there’s no record of any
of them. All of them gone or tucked away from sight. The hovercraft
removes Silka’s body. Trumpets declare my victory. A claw closes around
me.</p>
<p>Are there rules about breaking out of the arena and using the force
field to win? Possibly they are implied, but I have never heard them
mentioned. So, what am I? A rascal? A cheater even? Maybe. But clearly I
do not rise to the standard of a rebel.</p>
<p>The camera pulls back slowly as they carry me away, for the first
time revealing the arena as a whole. It looks like a giant eye. The
Cornucopia marks the pupil. The wide circle of spring-green meadow makes
up the iris. On either side, the darker green of the forest and mountain
terrain narrows to points, forming the whites of the eye. Well, the
symbolism has been lost on no one. Even the little kids in the Seam know
the Capitol powers are watching us.</p>
<p>I wonder if they ever consider that we’re watching them, too.</p>
<p>All eyes on me now, as I rise to my feet before the thundering crowd.
The anthem plays as President Snow descends from the heights on a
crystal platform, a bloodred rose in his lapel. In his hand, he holds a
golden crown.</p>
<p>Some victors bow, some kneel, but I just stand there trying to read
his expression as he approaches and places the crown on my head. Heavy.
Entrapping. “I guess Snow lands on top,” I say under the applause.
Utterly guilty on all possible counts, I await his sentence.</p>
<p>He merely smiles and says, “Enjoy your homecoming.”</p>
