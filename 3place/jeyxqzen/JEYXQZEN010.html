<h4 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h4>
<p>A fragile collection of muscles and bones, a few quarts of blood,
wrapped up in a paper-thin package of skin. That’s all I am. As I pass
through the doors of this marble fortress, I have never felt more
breakable.</p>
<p>My eyes travel up the walls to the lofty ceiling over the entryway.
No poodles or oranges here. Just more marble and huge urns filled with
bunches of flowers the size of bushes.</p>
<p>A servant in a starched apron runs a feather duster over a naked
statue. She catches my eye, her lips parting in pity. Her tongue’s
missing. She’s an Avox, one of the mutilated prisoners forced to
wordlessly serve the Capitol for life. Will they take my tongue? The
thought turns my mouth bone-dry. Dying at the end of Panache’s sword now
seems like a mercy.</p>
<p>“This way,” says Plutarch.</p>
<p>The carpet has the soft spring of a bed of moss, and it absorbs my
footsteps as if I’m already gone and beyond making a sound. One of the
ghosts that inhabit Lenore Dove’s songs. She once told me about being
arrested by the Peacekeepers back home, how frightened she was at first.
Then she remembered she’d read that sometimes the only thing you can
control is your attitude to a situation. “Like I could decide whether I
was scared or not, no matter what happened. I mean, I was still scared,
but it helped having that to chew on.”</p>
<p>I try to chew on it, but there’s too much adrenaline pumping through
my veins. Help me, Lenore Dove, I think. But she can’t. No one can.</p>
<p>Plutarch leads me down a long, arched hallway lined with lifesized
paintings of haughty people in fine, old-fashioned clothes. Each holds
an object — a scale, a harp, a ruby-studded cup — that seems meant to
define them.</p>
<p>Plutarch gestures indifferently. “Meet the Heavensbees,” he says.</p>
<p>Wait . . . the Heavensbees? Is this his family? And could this
actually be his house?</p>
<p>There’s no shortage of Heavensbees; they watch over us through
several halls, flaunting their signature possessions — a leafy branch, a
glossy white bird, a sword, is that a turkey leg? Dripping in wealth,
every last one of them. We pass doorways, some tightly sealed, some
flung open to reveal roomfuls of elegant furniture and twinkling crystal
lights. Other than an occasional Avox slinking in the shadows, it’s
deserted.</p>
<p>I think about how many people spent their lives building this place,
how many died before its completion, so that the Heavensbees could have
somewhere to hang their pictures. Their smug, satisfied, ridiculous
pictures. Well, the joke’s on the Heavensbees. Now they’re dead,
too.</p>
<p>Finally, we turn into a room where an old man with a white beard
holding out an open book smiles down from his portrait above the
fireplace.</p>
<p>“Trajan Heavensbee,” says Plutarch. “I’m his great-, great- — I can
never remember how many greats. Anyway, he was one of my grandfathers.
The only one who’s been of any use really. This was his library. It’s a
good place to talk.”</p>
<p>Talking isn’t torturing, so I calm down a little. The walls come into
focus. They’re not lined with instruments of pain but towering shelves
of books. Thousands and thousands of volumes, floor to ceiling. In the
corner, a golden staircase spirals up a column of white marble and leads
to a balcony that runs around the room. A gold eagle perches on the
railing at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>This room is Lenore Dove’s dream come true. A world of words to wrap
herself up in. Each book’s as precious as a person, she says, as it
preserves someone’s thoughts and feelings long after they’re gone. The
Covey have a collection of them, ancient things with cracked leather
bindings and paper delicate as moth’s wings. The family treasure.</p>
<p>Although most of us learn our letters in school, there aren’t a lot
of books in 12. Sometimes one appears at the Hob, and if I’ve got
anything to trade with, I snatch it up to save for Lenore Dove’s
birthday, regardless of the subject, since they’re so hard to come by.
There was a paperback guide to raising poultry once, and even though it
mostly talked about chickens and she’s a goose girl, she loved it.
Another time, I found a collection of maps from long before the Dark
Days, pretty useless now. But I really struck gold last year with a
small volume of poems by the long dead. Some of those made it into
songs.</p>
<p>I remember the joy on Lenore Dove’s face when I gave her the poetry,
the kisses that followed, and feel stronger. They can’t destroy what
really matters.</p>
<p>“Do you read, Haymitch?” Plutarch asks.</p>
<p>“I can read.”</p>
<p>“No, I meant, do you like to read?”</p>
<p>“Depends on what.”</p>
<p>“I’m the same,” says Plutarch. “Reading in general isn’t a popular
pastime in the Capitol. It’s a shame. Everything you need to know about
people is right here in this room.” He turns a knob shaped like a goat’s
head on what I took to be a desk built into the bookshelves. The top
splits in two and a tray full of sparkling bottles rises in its place.
Plutarch pours himself a glass of amber liquid. “Can I offer you
something?”</p>
<p>“I don’t drink.” Professional curiosity wins out, though — I’m a
bootlegger, after all — and I cross to examine the booze. What we call
white liquor’s as clear as water, but his bar boasts every color of the
rainbow. I don’t know if these have been dyed or aged or mixed with
other things, like herbs. It’s all white liquor, only dressed up. The
bottles have little silver nameplates on chains. Vodka. Rye. Cognac.</p>
<p>Then I spy a name I recognize, even though I’ve never seen the stuff.
I lift the bottle and let the light dance off its rosy depths.</p>
<p>“It’s called nepenthe,” says Plutarch. “You probably haven’t heard of
it.”</p>
<p>You’d be wrong there, Plutarch. Not only have I heard of it, I know
it from the poem that gave my love her name. I’m tired of being
patronized, so I decide to put him in his place. “You mean, like ‘Quaff,
oh quaff this kind nepenthe . . .’ ?”</p>
<p>Plutarch’s eyebrows shoot up in surprise. He completes the line. “‘.
. . and forget this lost Lenore!’”</p>
<p>Now I’m surprised, and a little unsettled. I guess, with all these
books, her poem could be here. But for him not only to have read it, but
memorized it, unnerves me. I don’t like her name in his mouth.</p>
<p>“Of course, it’s unclear in the poem if nepenthe’s the liquor or the
drug added to the liquor,” he continues.</p>
<p>I remember having this same discussion with Lenore Dove. She said
quaff means to drink, usually something with alcohol. And the guy
telling the story in the song is trying to stop thinking about how he
lost his true love.</p>
<p>“I think the important part is it makes you forget terrible things,”
I say.</p>
<p>“Exactly. I’m sure this is just a poor imitation. Grain alcohol
colored with berries. In the old days, it actually contained morphling,
but the stuff was so addictive it was banned. May I ask how you know
that poem, Haymitch?”</p>
<p>“Everybody knows it in Twelve.” That’s a big lie, but I want him to
think we all learned it in a book, like he did.</p>
<p>“Really? Huh. Well, I’ve got something you’ll want to see. It’s in
the conservatory.”</p>
<p>Sure, the conservatory. Whatever that is. He leads me out a side
door, down a narrow hallway, and into a room whose domed ceiling frames
a piece of the evening sky. Glass curves around to form the walls as
well, revealing a garden of bright flowers and trees outside. Seems like
overkill, since the room’s already filled with plants that glisten in
the humid air. Birds fly freely among the overhead beams, chirping their
heads off. Little tables and chairs covered in curlicues surround a
fountain that splashes water into a pool. One table holds a telephone
shaped like a sleeping swan, its head and curved neck forming the
receiver. Something buzzes near my ear and I swat it away.</p>
<p>It’s like they’ve tried to bring the whole outdoors indoors. Why? Is
opening a door and walking through it too much trouble? Fools and their
money are soon parted, Ma would say.</p>
<p>“Come, look at this.” Plutarch waves me over to a plant that hangs
from a beam in a basket near the swan phone. From the long, shiny green
leaves dangle pinkish pods, each equipped with what looks like a little
lid. A small pool of liquid has collected at the bottom of each pod. As
I inhale the faintly sweet, faintly rotten smell, Plutarch points to
one. “They put out a nectar. Insects adore it. But the surface is
slippery, and they fall into the pod and can’t get out. They drown and
are consumed by the plant.”</p>
<p>“I think I’m missing something.”</p>
<p>He taps an engraved nameplate on the side of the pot. Somebody in
this place must have a full-time job labeling things. It reads
nepenthes. I have to think this over.</p>
<p>“Well,” I conclude, “that’s one way of drowning your sorrows.”</p>
<p>Plutarch chuckles. “You’re the first person who’s ever gotten the
joke.”</p>
<p>There he goes again. Trying to make me feel human.</p>
<p>“Why am I here, Plutarch?” I ask.</p>
<p>Before he can answer, someone else interjects, “For me.”</p>
<p>I don’t recognize the voice at first because its smoothness has
deteriorated into a raspy growl. I turn and see President Snow leaning
against the doorway, wiping his brow with a hand-kerchief. Once again,
I’m rattled by being in his presence. The power of his position. The
record of his cruelty. Evil in the flesh. Was my crime really so great
that it requires a personal meeting? Especially when, on closer
observation, he’s clearly unwell. Perspiring and breathless and white as
a sheet. His regal bearing abandoned as he hunches over his gut. For
once, despite his cosmetic treatments, he looks his fifty-eight
years.</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. President,” says Plutarch. “Are you feeling all right? It’s
the heat. Let’s find you a seat.” He hurries over and repositions a
chair by the fountain. “I meant for you to use the library. It’s cooler
in there. Would you prefer that?”</p>
<p>The president seems too preoccupied to respond. He takes uneven steps
toward the fountain and his whole body seizes up for a second. Blood
trickles from the corner of his mouth onto his white shirtfront as he
drops into the chair.</p>
<p>“Can I get you anything? Maybe an icepack?” asks Plutarch. “There’s a
powder room just over —” Snow leans forward and vomits a foul mess into
the fountain. “Oh, okay.”</p>
<p>Glad I don’t have to clean that up.</p>
<p>Sweat streams down Snow’s waxy face. But there’s no embarrassment or
apology. No effort to disguise this moment of weakness. It’s almost like
he wants us to see it. I’ll probably be dead soon. Is it for Plutarch’s
benefit?</p>
<p>The president slumps back in the chair, panting. “Too hot.”</p>
<p>“Right, let’s get you back in the library.” Plutarch hoists the
president to his feet and gets his shoulder under an armpit. “Haymitch.”
I’m not being asked, I’m being ordered. I secure Snow’s other side,
holding my breath to avoid inhaling the noxious smell of puke and
flowery perfume that rises from him. Bodily contact with him in this
state makes me a little braver. He’s just a man, as mortal as the rest
of us. For all I know, he’s on his way out right now.</p>
<p>Plutarch and I haul the president back into the library, where we
deposit him on an embroidered couch.</p>
<p>“You need a doctor, Mr. President,” Plutarch advises.</p>
<p>“No doctor,” croaks Snow, grasping Plutarch’s arm. “Milk.”</p>
<p>“Milk? Haymitch, check the bar. We keep some for milk punch. The
refrigerator’s on the right.”</p>
<p>I take my time, playing the confused district piglet who doesn’t know
left from right and, even when he’s worked that out, can’t figure out
how to spring the paneled door that conceals the fridge. When I finally
open it, I spot the milk in a pint-sized white china pitcher. A golden
staircase wraps around the cylinder, and an eagle perches on the lid. A
replica of the steps in the corner of the library.</p>
<p>I glance around the refrigerator door as Snow goes into a coughing
fit while Plutarch hovers over him.</p>
<p>This is probably the best chance I will ever have to fight back
against Snow directly. Here’s to you, Louella. I tip open the eagle lid,
down the milk, and wipe the moustache from my lip. Then I close the
door, holding out the pitcher helplessly. “It’s empty.”</p>
<p>Plutarch’s eyes widen in disbelief; he knows full well what I’ve
done. I wait for him to rat me out. Instead, he murmurs in exasperation,
“Those servants!” and disappears out the door, shouting for more milk to
be brought. Like I said, unpredictable as lightning.</p>
<p>I’m left alone with a retching Snow. It’s scary watching him possibly
die. It’s even scarier that I can resist helping him. Before the
reaping, I bet I would have been right in there. Louella’s death changed
me. Maybe I’ll end up being victor material after all.</p>
<p>Snow gags, empties a crystal bowl of waxed pears onto the table, and
vomits a new wave, more blackish than bloody, into it. I wonder what old
Trajan Heavensbee thinks of that. Keep smiling, Trajan — he’s the
president, after all. Snow’s breathing calms. Ridding his body of that
last batch seems to have improved his condition. He takes in the room,
the portrait, me. Swabs his mouth out with the handkerchief and stuffs
it in his pocket.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease,” he muses.</p>
<p>“What disease?”</p>
<p>“Incompetence. You can’t ignore it, or it spreads.”</p>
<p>Plutarch comes back carrying a second pitcher of milk. “There was
some in the billiard room.”</p>
<p>Snow chugs the milk and holds out the empty pitcher. “Another. And
some bread.”</p>
<p>Plutarch looks at the reeking bowl. “Are you sure, Mr. President?
Sometimes with stomach illnesses, it’s best to —”</p>
<p>“Not an illness. Food poisoning. A batch of bad oysters. But I’ve
fared far better than Incitatus Loomy.”</p>
<p>“The parade master?” asks Plutarch, a funny look crossing his
face.</p>
<p>“Was he?” Snow hands him the bowl. “Bring what I’ve asked.”</p>
<p>When Plutarch goes, Snow peruses the wall of books before him. “Look
at them all. Survivors. During the Dark Days, people burned books to
stay alive. We certainly did. But not the Heavensbees. They remained
stinking rich, even when the best families were reduced to squalor.” He
removes a small bottle from his pocket, uncorks it, and swallows the
contents, shuddering as it settles. “Classmate of mine, Hilarius, was
one of them. Useless whiner.” He blots his puffy lips on his cuff. “At
least Plutarch comes in handy occasionally, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Plutarch handy to me? What does Snow know?</p>
<p>“I think he believes you catch more flies with honey than with
vinegar,” I respond.</p>
<p>Snow snorts. “Ah, the homey aphorisms of District Twelve are alive
and well.”</p>
<p>I don’t know what an aphorism is — some sort of saying? Lenore Dove
would know. But I can tell my way of talking is being sneered at, even
if I don’t know exactly what he means.</p>
<p>“I’d be surprised if anything much has changed there,” he continues.
“Nothing but coal dust and miners soaked in rotgut liquor from the Hob.
Everybody just waiting to be subsumed by that ghastly wilderness.”</p>
<p>His insult disturbs me less than his familiarity with District 12.
Miners soaked in rotgut liquor from the Hob — that’s us, all right. The
worst of us, anyway.</p>
<p>“Come sit down, where I can see you.”</p>
<p>Again, not an invitation, an order. I set the milk pitcher next to
the nepenthe on the bar and circle around to sit on a sofa across from
the president. The embroidered pillow at his elbow features the same
image of the golden staircase as the pitcher. Matchy-matchy, as Maysilee
would say.</p>
<p>Snow’s eyes zoom in on the flint striker, as they did last night.
“That’s a striking necklace.”</p>
<p>Striking . . . flint striker . . . perhaps he’s recognized its true
purpose and will have it banned from the arena.</p>
<p>He holds out his hand. “May I have a look?”</p>
<p>I could brush Maysilee off, but not the president. I untie the knot
in the leather shoelace, give the flint striker a good squeeze in case
this is good-bye, and pass it over.</p>
<p>Snow rubs his thumbs over the bird and snake heads. “There’s a pretty
pair.” He flips it. “And an inscription.”</p>
<p>An inscription? I must’ve missed it in the whirlwind of reaping day.
Without asking for permission, he pulls a pair of specs from his breast
pocket and tilts the striker to catch the light. “Ah, very sweet. From
L.D. Who might that be?”</p>
<p>Lying to conceal her won’t help. Even though they didn’t air it to
the country, I bet they showed Snow what happened during the reaping. Me
trying to save a girl from the Peacekeepers. Her reaction to my reaping.
Twelve’s a small district. If he has a mind to, he will track down my
girlfriend.</p>
<p>“Lenore,” I say.</p>
<p>“But Lenore what? No, no, don’t tell me. Let me guess. D . . . D . .
. That’s a tough one. None of the usual suspects, but they so rarely
are. I can think of plenty prefaced by deep or dark. Deep blue. Dark
green. But that’s not how they work. Perhaps something in nature? Like
amber or ivory. Daffodil . . . dandelion . . . diamond? No, that’s no
color at all, really. All right, I’m stumped. Lenore what?”</p>
<p>The milk has soured in my stomach at his musings and what they
reveal. He knows Lenore Dove is Covey; only they name their children
this way. First name from a ballad, second a color. Amber and Ivory are
actual family names. How has he unearthed this obscure fact about a
pocket of musicians in the throwaway district of 12? Capitol
informers?</p>
<p>“Dove,” I tell him.</p>
<p>“Dove!” He smacks his forehead. “Dove. I have always heard ‘dove
color,’ though. It’s a bit of a cheat. But who could resist when you get
both the color and the bird? And we know how they feel about their
birds.”</p>
<p>He returns the striker. On the back, in minuscule script, are the
words I’d missed. For H. I love you like all-fire. L.D.</p>
<p>“Do you know much about doves, Haymitch?”</p>
<p>“They’re peaceful.”</p>
<p>“If they are, they’re outliers. All the birds I’ve encountered are
vicious.” A dribble of bloody spittle leaks from Snow’s mouth. “Bet I
know a thing or two about your dove.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Like she’s delightful to look at, swishes around in bright colors,
and sings like a mockingjay. You love her. And oh, how she seems to love
you. Except sometimes you wonder, because her plans don’t include you at
all.”</p>
<p>Not exactly, but too close. I think of the misty look she gets when
she talks about the open road, the life of the Covey, and a kind of
freedom that has nothing to do with me. Worse, I think of Clay Chance
and the fire under the reaping stage and how there’s a part of her she
refuses to share with me. She’d say it was to keep me safe, but maybe
she just doesn’t trust me with her secrets.</p>
<p>“She loves me,” I insist.</p>
<p>“No doubt she says so. But believe me, romantically speaking, you’re
dodging a bullet with these Games.”</p>
<p>“So I should be thanking you?”</p>
<p>Snow laughs. “You should. Although perhaps not for that.”</p>
<p>“For what? You’re sending me to my death in the Games.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your behavior has guaranteed that.”</p>
<p>There it is, in case I had a shred of hope left. Straight from the
horse’s mouth. Allies or no, I am a dead man walking.</p>
<p>“On the good side,” he continues, “with you out of the picture,
Lenore Dove and your family should be free to enjoy long and happy
lives.”</p>
<p>Even though their safety is my greatest concern, his reminder that
their future will not include me is, as Maysilee would say, “a special
kind of vicious.”</p>
<p>Snow dabs at the spittle with his shirt cuff. “But there are many
different ways to die in the arena. You might get stabbed, or strangled,
or die of thirst. Death by mutt tends to be the most memorable. We have
some beauties this year. Programmable to serve individual tributes. And
far scarier than the weasels.”</p>
<p>He watched it, then. Our tribute session in the kitchen where we
revealed our final wishes. “I have no say in that.”</p>
<p>“No, but I do. And I will orchestrate your death based on your
behavior from here on out. You decide what you want Lenore Dove and your
mother and that dear little brother of yours to see. You can die clean
and fair, or we can open the Games with the slowest, most agonizing
death ever to befall a tribute. And yes, you should be thanking me for
giving you the option.”</p>
<p>I meet those pale blue eyes. “I guess you’ve got me.”</p>
<p>“Don’t feel too badly. You’re in good company. You know, my family
has its own little aphorism.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Snow lands on top.” Without shifting his focus from me, he calls
out, “Hide-and-seek is over! You can join us now!”</p>
<p>Who is he summoning? My torturers, brought in to reinforce his
threat?</p>
<p>“So, no more unauthorized chariot rides, I think. No mocking me on or
off camera,” he continues. “And I have a belated birthday gift for you.
I want it treated with the gratitude it deserves.” He inclines his head
in the direction of the conservatory.</p>
<p>Standing in the doorway is Louella McCoy.</p>
