<h4 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h4>
<p>The night seems both endless and way too short. I’m awake but
exhausted when Mags comes to rouse us. We wash up and put on our old
training outfits, since they won’t dress us until we’re in the holding
pens at the arena. I know Maysilee’s unhappy with me for abandoning the
Newcomers. As a peace offering, I slip Beetee’s birthday gift, the
turn-a-potato-into-a-light packet, into her hand as we head to the
kitchen. Although she doesn’t acknowledge me, it disappears into her
pocket.</p>
<p>There’s a big hot breakfast, but it’s all Wyatt and I can do to
swallow a few bites, the stuff sticks in our throats so, and Maysilee
only wants coffee. Lou Lou, on the other hand, eats a stack of pancakes
as high as her head and fistfuls of bacon, confirming that she’s too far
gone to know what the next few days hold for her. That’s a blessing, I
guess. She looks so defenseless without her snake.</p>
<p>Wiress gives us last-minute pointers and then seems to shut down.
Mags hugs each of us and says that whatever happens, we have been
remarkable. She knows at least three of us won’t be back. What else can
she say?</p>
<p>All pretense is over. We are being propelled forward, faster and
faster, to the inevitable moment when the gong sounds. All the tribute
preparation — the costumes, the training, the interviews — was just a
distraction from the real agenda. Today some of us will die.</p>
<p>Drusilla drops by the apartment to complete her last official escort
duty, seeing we’re searched and loaded into the van. I don’t know where
Maysilee stowed the packet, but she comes up clean. Once we’re chained
in, a woman in a white coat and carrying a set of syringes shoots
something into each of our forearms. She doesn’t have to tell us it’s
our tracker, an electronic device that allows the Gamemakers to find us
in the arena.</p>
<p>“What happens if we win? Do they take it out?” asks Wyatt.</p>
<p>“We collect all of them from the tributes, dead or alive,” says the
woman. “They’re reusable. Of course, this year we needed twenty-four
extra.”</p>
<p>Thanks for reminding us.</p>
<p>Drusilla stands at the back of the van. “All right, you lot,” she
says. “Try not to embarrass me.”</p>
<p>Maysilee rallies one last time. “As if you needed our help.”</p>
<p>Drusilla slams the door shut on us.</p>
<p>We’re taken to some sort of runway where a half dozen hovercraft
await, then loaded into a windowless compartment and strapped into our
seats across from District 11. They look as terrif ied as we do. Only
Lou Lou seems unbothered. She catches sight of the token that one of the
girls, Chicory, wears — a flower woven of grass — and fixates on it.
Then she begins to make little hand motions as she sings in a breathy
voice:</p>
<p>Flower there beside my feet</p>
<p>Growing up between the corn</p>
<p>Combine’s here so duck your head</p>
<p>Duck your head</p>
<p>Duck your head</p>
<p>Combine’s here so duck your head</p>
<p>To see another morn.</p>
<p>Chicory reacts with surprise. She addresses the rest of us, since Lou
Lou’s mental state precludes answering. “How does she know that song?
You sing it in Twelve?”</p>
<p>As something of an authority on songs in 12 by virtue of time spent
with Lenore Dove, I shake my head.</p>
<p>“That’s a harvest song for kids,” Chicory continues. “That’s our
song.” She peers at Lou Lou’s face, exchanges a look with her 11
tributes, then sings:</p>
<p>Mockingjay up on the branch —</p>
<p>Lou Lou takes over the song at once.</p>
<p>Nesting in this apple tree</p>
<p>Picking time so fly away</p>
<p>Fly away</p>
<p>Fly away</p>
<p>Picking time so fly away</p>
<p>Fly away with me.</p>
<p>“How do you explain that, then?” Chicory asks us.</p>
<p>“We don’t,” says Maysilee. “She’s not ours. Ours is dead and she’s
the replacement they sent us. Like as not, she’s from Eleven. Our
mentors think so anyway.” She never seems to care if the Capitol’s
listening.</p>
<p>Tile, the largest of the 11 tributes, speaks in a tight voice. “You
didn’t think that was worth mentioning?”</p>
<p>“We didn’t know for sure until now,” says Wyatt. “We’ve just been
trying to look out for her. Does it matter where they took her from,
Eleven or Twelve? Aren’t we all on the same side?”</p>
<p>Lou Lou ignores us all as she tries to wriggle out of her safety
straps.</p>
<p>“Do you know who she might be?” I ask.</p>
<p>Chicory shakes her head. “We’re a big district. And who knows how
long she’s been with them.” She leans toward Lou Lou as much as her
straps allow. “Little girl? What’s your real name? If one of us makes it
back, we can tell your family.”</p>
<p>Lou Lou hesitates, attempts to speak, then grabs her ear and lets out
a shriek. Wyatt catches her free hand and tries to soothe her.</p>
<p>“We think they put something in her ear to control her,” Maysilee
tells them.</p>
<p>“That’s why you wanted us to be careful what we say,” says Chicory,
putting it together. “They’re listening.” She sits back in her seat, her
face sorrowful. “Maybe her people will recognize her.”</p>
<p>I don’t say so, but I’ve got a feeling her people are long dead, and
if they’re alive, how tragic for them to see her only to lose her again.
There’s no good ending to Lou Lou’s story.</p>
<p>We lift off, which would be amazing under other circumstances but
here only adds to my queasiness. Everybody shuts up for a while, which
gives me a chance to mentally prepare. I should be planning my strategy
in the arena, but I just keep thinking about Lenore Dove, and how much I
love her, and wondering if she’s home by now and how she’s doing. And
Ma. And Sid. Burdock and Blair. Hattie. Before I know it, we’re
descending.</p>
<p>When we arrive at the arena, we’re escorted directly from an interior
landing pad to a hallway. I can’t look out, but it feels underground,
and I’m certain I’m on Sub-A. I turn my head from side to side, trying
to take in every detail of the place as we walk along a curved concrete
floor. There are some sort of pipes to my right and doors spaced out to
my left, which begin with four marked with the number 6 and go up from
there. Four of the same number each time. 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8 . . .
It’s a bit of a hike until we get to an 11 and they direct Chicory
inside. We lose the rest of our 11 allies and then a Peacekeeper opens
the first door marked 12.</p>
<p>I hold out my arms. Without a word, Wyatt and Maysilee join in a
group embrace. Lou Lou wiggles into the center of the hug and we tighten
our hold, feeling one another’s pulses and sweat and skin. Ten minutes
from now, who will even still have a heartbeat?</p>
<p>After a minute, a Peacekeeper says, “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>We peel off into our rooms, me last of all. Before I go in, I catch
sight of the next door down the hall, which has a 1 on it. A ring of
tributes for the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>I’m alone in a circular room with a transparent tube in the center of
it. My launchpad. A neatly folded set of clothes sits on a lone chair.
Black, like Maysilee suspected.</p>
<p>The intercom crackles to life. A voice greets me: “Welcome to your
launch room.” At home we call it the Stockyard. The place where animals
wait to be slaughtered. The voice instructs, “The tributes are to change
into their new outfits, courtesy of the Capitol.” Courtesy of the
Capitol. My flour sack shorts. Ma. Sid.</p>
<p>I strip, tossing my training outfit in a pile on the floor. All the
arena clothes — underwear, long-sleeved shirt, pants — feel like one of
the old silk scarves Lenore Dove uses to accent her costumes. Thin and
cool, the fabric runs through my hands like water. There’s a belt but no
loops on the pants, only on the flowing shirt, so I fasten it around my
waist. It’s made of stretchy material, and instead of a buckle, it’s
secured with two metallic circles that interlock and then unfasten with
a quick twist. When I finish dressing, my knees feel wobbly and I drop
into the chair, listening to the pounding of my heart. The arena’s
minutes away. I can’t remember what to do. I hear Wiress’s voice. . .
.</p>
<p>First avoid the slaughter,</p>
<p>Get weapons, look for water.</p>
<p>Water. Right. I’m supposed to drown the brain. What?</p>
<p>More instructions. “Tributes, please enter your tubes.”</p>
<p>I rise shakily to my feet as the door handle turns and Effie Trinket
flies into the room. “Wait, not yet! I have to check him!” She’s white
as a sheet. “I only found out I was supposed to do this at breakfast,”
she says in a hushed voice. “No one could find Magno.” She quickly goes
over my outfit, adjusting the belt. “Did you see this?” She shows me my
pants have a handkerchief in one of the pockets, which I leave in
place.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I manage.</p>
<p>“Tributes who are not in their tubes in thirty seconds will be
disciplined,” says the voice.</p>
<p>“Come on!” Effie guides me to the tube and centers me on a glass
plate. She arranges my token so it’s outside the shirt.</p>
<p>The trembling of her hands allows me to ask a favor. “Will you make
sure my token gets home to my girl?”</p>
<p>Effie nods and lays a hand over it solemnly. “I will do my absolute
best.” She steps back and the door begins to slide shut. “Remember,
Haymitch, don’t step off your plate for sixty seconds!” As the door
clicks shut, she pumps the air with a fist and adds, “And keep a
positive attitude!”</p>
<p>I rise up, locking my eyes on hers until things go black, making me
lose my bearings. My sweaty palms swipe the sides of the glass tube as I
try to steady myself. Then the tube runs out and I’m teetering on my
plate when a gust of air hits my face and the light blinds my eyes. As
they adjust, my brows shoot up in disbelief as I get my first look at
the arena.</p>
<p>The beauty takes my breath away.</p>
<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen, let the Fiftieth Hunger Games begin!”
proclaims an announcer.</p>
<p>A scowl contracts my face as suspicion sets in. It’s just too
attractive to be good. The smooth green meadow stretching for miles in
either direction. The array of colorful songbirds overhead that match
the tufts of cheerful flowers underfoot that match the outfits on the
tributes’ backs. Sky so blue it hurts your eyes, clouds so fluffy you
want to bounce on them. And the smell! Like they bottled the best day of
spring and uncorked it just for us.</p>
<p>I block my nose and begin to mouth-breathe to avoid the dizzying
scent. I try to examine the shiny gold Cornucopia in its nest of weapons
and supplies that rests in the center of the meadow fifty yards away,
but a gentle breeze caresses my face, and the birdsong distracts me with
thoughts of Lenore Dove. There are woods here, too, like our woods in
12, far off to my left. To my right, a small mountain with a crown of
snow. Is that where the tank is? Under the mountain?</p>
<p>A fluffball of a bunny rabbit hops up to my foot and nibbles the
grass next to my plate, its pale gray fur tinted lilac and pink. A shade
of dove. I’m reaching for the silken coat when suddenly the rabbit
startles and speeds off, bringing me to my senses.</p>
<p>Focus! my brain orders. What are you supposed to be doing?</p>
<p>First avoid the slaughter,</p>
<p>Get weapons, look for water.</p>
<p>Right. I have to get weapons and get out of here. But which direction
do I need to run? North. Beetee said go north. And Plutarch said the
arena sun is positioned like our sun. Do I believe Plutarch? I think of
getting to say good-bye to my family and how he covered for me with the
milk pitcher and the call to Lenore Dove. . . . Okay, what the hell, I
do! Wiress said to trust your instincts and mine say he was telling the
truth. If I don’t locate any berms, maybe I’ll reconsider. But for now .
. .</p>
<p>It’s nine o’clock in the morning and the sun’s rising up behind the
Cornucopia directly across from me. Okay, that’s east, west to my back,
that makes north to my right. No! My left. North to the left. Where the
woods are, not the mountain. That’s good news because the tributes
fanned out to my right are mostly Careers, Silka on the next plate, then
Panache and the other girl and boy from District 1, then District 2,
while to the left it’s nothing but Newcomers. In general, District 1’s
too close for comfort, but they’ll want weapons and kills more than
they’ll want to chase me down, especially if I’m armed, and there are
such easy pickings. I spot Ampert and the other District 3 tributes
sandwiched between Districts 2 and 4 and have to squelch the impulse to
run in to protect them. Ampert wouldn’t want me to. He’d want me to
clear out and find a mutt portal and rendezvous with him as soon as
possible. He’ll be headed north soon, too.</p>
<p>I home in on a spring-green backpack near the tail of the Cornucopia.
I can run at a diagonal directly at it, grab a few weapons on the way,
or at least a knife, and hopefully be gone before anyone notices. It
might work — people look pretty confused. I see Panache’s head twist as
a daffodil-yellow bird perches on his shoulder and twitters.</p>
<p>Then the gong rings out and the treads of my new boots grip the
meadow grass as I sprint for the backpack. Barely breaking pace, I scoop
up a spear in my left hand and a knife in my right, which I use to hook
the strap of the backpack. I allow myself one quick glance over my
shoulder, which is enough to reassure me that the Careers are late to
the party, some still on their plates, others slow on the uptake and
just reaching the weapons. As I make for the woods, I lock eyes with
Kerna for a second, clock her sunflower as she heads for a weapon. And
then I just run for those distant trees.</p>
<p>It’s only moments before the screams begin, but I force myself to
stay on course, knowing that seeing a District 12 tribute or any
Newcomer at death’s door could pull me into the fray. Was that Lou Lou’s
shriek? It was a girl’s, a young one’s certainly. Don’t look back, I
tell myself. Don’t you dare look back.</p>
<p>My right arm aches from the weight of the pack, so I take a moment to
secure it on my back and slip the knife safely in my belt. Spear in my
right hand now, I settle on a jog I think I can sustain for the long
haul to the north. The meadow grass, which was short and even at the
Cornucopia, increases in height as I progress, until it’s tall enough to
tangle my boots if I don’t step high, so I step high and keep an eye out
for snakes. I only spot flowers, songbirds, and the occasional bunny.
Nothing venomous or deadly.</p>
<p>I revisit Wiress’s checklist.</p>
<p>First avoid the slaughter,</p>
<p>Doing it.</p>
<p>Get weapons,</p>
<p>Got them.</p>
<p>look for water.</p>
<p>I can’t yet. Not until I’m safely in the woods and then it will have
to be on my way north. Say I find it quick. Then what?</p>
<p>Find food and where to sleep,</p>
<p>Nope, way too soon. Still slaughter avoidance going on. Then I have
to get as close to the tank as possible and find a mutt portal. But I
feel okay about my progress.</p>
<p>I run as long as I can, then slow to a hike and use my spear for a
walking stick. The grass now reaches my waist. Up ahead, the forest
borders the meadow in a smooth arc. The lush trees, a mix of greens with
bursts of gold and orange, laden with bright blooms and ripe fruit,
promise everything I seek. Shade from the hot sun, food to fill my
belly, concealment from the Careers. The heady scent of pine and
blossoms wafting from the woods calms my racing heart. Charming . . .
enticing . . . these words don’t do it justice. There’s something almost
magical about it, as if once inside those leafy arms, nothing bad could
ever befall you. This must be how insects feel in the nepenthes plant,
right before they drown. Which may well be my fate when the tank
explodes.</p>
<p>When I reach the tree line, I judge I’ve covered about two miles. I
climb on a big rock to check for tributes, but the expanse of grass
seems empty of both allies and enemies. The cannon shots begin, letting
me know the bloodbath at the Cornucopia has ended. Normally, they fire
to confirm any death, but those come on so thick and fast at the
beginning that the Gamemakers wait until the initial killing spree has
ended. The booms keep coming, resonating in my backbone, until I count
eighteen of us dead. I won’t know who until tonight when they show the
faces of the fallen tributes in the sky. But there are only sixteen
Careers, so the Newcomers have not been spared. Probably, many are
Newcomers.</p>
<p>I try not to think about who, but it could be Maysilee or Wyatt or
Lou Lou or Ringina or Ampert. . . . What if Ampert has already been
taken out? What happens to the plan then? He was an easy target in that
big patch of Careers. . . . No! I tell myself. No. He’s too smart. He
will find you. Just do your part of the job.</p>
<p>I take a seat on the rock to catch my breath and examine my backpack.
After years of hauling grain for Hattie, I can confidently judge it to
be around twenty-five pounds. It’s made of a nice tough canvas with
padded straps. The spring green should blend well with the trees. I
hesitate before I open it — my life may well depend on the contents —
then flip back the flap and begin to lay out my supplies.</p>
<p>A mesh hammock, same color as the pack, cushions a fancy pair of
binoculars. Two plastic gallon jugs full of water. That accounts for
much of the weight. A dozen apples. A dozen eggs in a cardboard carton,
which I determine are hard-boiled by spinning them. And finally, six
large potatoes, which excite me until I remember I gave the light bulb
kit to Maysilee. Well, she and Wyatt stand a better chance of not
getting caught cheating with Beetee’s stuff, given they’ve got a zinc
scrip coin and a copper medallion between them. Hopefully, they got some
potatoes, too. For me, these will probably be dinner.</p>
<p>To be honest, given the size of the pack and its proximity to the
Cornucopia, I was hoping for better. I scrounge around inside to make
sure I didn’t miss anything. An outside pocket adds a generous packet of
coin-sized black tablets to my haul. I’m thinking maybe if you drop them
in water, they turn into a steak dinner or something, but a cautious
nibble blows that theory. If I’m not mistaken, these are the same
charcoal tablets Mamaw used to buy from the Marches’ shop for her
indigestion when she overate. A bad joke on the Gamemakers’ part, given
that no tribute’s in danger of overeating. They’re probably all having a
good laugh at my reaction now. Whatever. Maybe I can use them for
camouflage or something.</p>
<p>I take a big swig of water and reload my pack. No food allowed until
I get a better sense of what’s available in the woods. Then I make sure
the mountain’s squarely at my back and head into the trees.</p>
<p>It’s a relief to get off the meadow grass and onto a forest floor
made of dirt covered in pine needles. Scattered patches of emerald moss
and a rainbow of ferns add a decorative touch. In a few minutes, I spot
my first berm, smooth and symmetrical with a glorious layer of
buttercups. Plutarch was right about that much anyway. Does it conceal a
mutt portal? No time to check now, and anyway, I’m not northerly
enough.</p>
<p>The woods are as picture-perfect as the meadow, full of sweet
colorful things, but the farther I press on, the madder I get. That
tree? Groaning with apples. Those nests? Full of eggs. And streams
burbling with crystal-clear water abound. If it’s in my backpack, it’s
easy pickings. Probably I could dig anywhere and find potatoes. Was my
entire pack just a big joke?</p>
<p>Here I am, hauling twenty-five extra pounds around like a saphead.
Part of me feels like dumping the contents on the ground but then I’d
just have to waste time collecting it all again, so I keep trudging on,
noting the berms along the way. I hear two more cannon shots. Twenty
dead now. In a usual Games, only four tributes would be left alive. This
year, twenty-eight of us remain.</p>
<p>When my thirst begins to get to me, I stop by a stream. Propping my
pack against a tree, I scoop up a few handfuls of icy water. It’s a
little metallic, but not so much as our well water back home. I slow
down, though, because guzzling cold water on a hot day can give me a
bellyache.</p>
<p>As I lean against my pack, a dove-colored rabbit hops up across the
stream from me and helps itself to a good, long drink. It sits on the
bank, ears twitching, reminding me that I’ve helped Burdock set snares
on occasion. I don’t have any wire, though. And could I possibly kill a
creature that brings to mind my girl?</p>
<p>I’m pondering this when the bunny starts squealing like a baby bird,
goes stiff as a board, then falls over dead. A trickle of red stains the
fur on its chin.</p>
