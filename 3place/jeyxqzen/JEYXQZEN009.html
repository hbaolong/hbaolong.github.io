<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>Sore ribs and all, I think about punching the question right off
Plutarch’s face. Because the implication is clear: He isn’t just asking
why we didn’t start a mini rebellion in the gym. He means back in
District 12 as well. Why do we let the Capitol brutes rule us? Because
we’re cowards? Because we’re stupid?</p>
<p>“Why do you submit to it all?” he presses.</p>
<p>“Because you have the guns,” Ringina says flatly.</p>
<p>“Is it really about the weapons, though? I grant you, they’re an
advantage. On the other hand, when you consider the sheer difference in
numbers . . . district to Capitol . . .” Plutarch muses.</p>
<p>Yes, we far outnumber the Peacekeepers in 12. I think about the
weapons we could lay our hands on. Pickaxes, knives, possibly some
explosives. But in the face of automatic rifles, aerial bombings, gases,
and the Capitol’s menagerie of mutts?</p>
<p>“I don’t think we ‘submit,’” I say.</p>
<p>“It’s implied. You accept the Capitol’s conditions.”</p>
<p>“Because we don’t want to end up dead!” I snap. “Do you really not
see that?”</p>
<p>“No, I do. I see the hangings and the shootings and the starvation
and the Hunger Games. I do,” Plutarch says. “And yet, I still don’t
think the fear they inspire justifies this arrangement we’ve all entered
into. Do you?” We stare at him. He’s not taunting or mocking us, he’s
genuinely asking. “Why do you agree to it? Why do I? For that matter,
why have people always agreed to it?” When we don’t respond, he shrugs.
“Well, it’s something to think about.”</p>
<p>“You’re up, Haymitch.” Hersilia offers me a knife. Which I could (a)
throw or (b) drive into a Peacekeeper’s heart, ensuring my immediate
death. I’m a little wobbly but I still hit the target.</p>
<p>Plutarch waits for me at the end of the line. I try to ignore him,
but he keeps yapping. “You put on quite a show last night.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I bet you card-stacked it right into a compliment for
the president.”</p>
<p>“No need to. The broadcast to the public ended when that firecracker
went off. The Capitol News coverage is presenting the opening ceremony
as flawless.”</p>
<p>“I doubt that people who take Capitol News seriously will spend much
time questioning that,” I say. “They don’t care what happens to us
tributes, dead or alive.” I wonder what they did with Louella’s body. I
hope it’s been sent home to the McCoys. Their family plot’s right next
door to ours, so Louella and I will be reunited soon enough.</p>
<p>I start to turn away, but Plutarch lays a hand on my arm. “I’m sorry
about Louella, Haymitch. She was a person of substance. I could see that
right off.”</p>
<p>Is he actually giving me condolences? “Why do you keep dogging me?” I
snap at him. “There’s a gym full of people just aching for some
exposure. Why don’t you spread yourself around a little?”</p>
<p>“I’m assigned to cover Twelve.” He raises his hands and backs away.
“But I’ll try to give you some space.”</p>
<p>Aggravated by his probing, I pull Maysilee and Wyatt aside. “Listen,
if we join Ampert’s alliance, these folks from Seven will be on our
team. Now I’m going to introduce you to Ringina over there.” I give
Maysilee a hard stare. “You have to be nice. Don’t comment on her hair,
don’t comment on her nails, don’t comment on how she looks in brown,
don’t ask to examine her pin because you’re an authority on
jewelry.”</p>
<p>Maysilee sniffs. “I like her hair.”</p>
<p>“And, Wyatt, don’t be weird. Don’t start spouting out the odds on
their deaths.”</p>
<p>“Can I do other people’s deaths?”</p>
<p>“No! Not yet. Maybe not ever. It’s creepy! If you have to do odds, do
gifts or sponsors or something,” I say. “Forget about being loose
cannons. We need to seem like people you’d want to be your allies. Like
people you’d hope were beside you in a mine accident. Steady. Smart.
Trustworthy.”</p>
<p>Ampert, glowing in electric blue, runs up, swinging a loop of black
cord over his head. “Hey, Haymitch! District Ten is in. They’re the ones
in crimson. I met them in knot tying. One of the guys, Buck, made me
this lariat. I’m thinking of turning it into some kind of token, since I
didn’t bring one.” He wraps the cord in loose bands around his hand,
pulls it over his head, and drops his voice. “Then I can unwind it and
use it in the arena.”</p>
<p>Maysilee’s lips twitch. “Well, you can’t wear it like that. It’s not
the least bit ornamental. You look like a weasel caught in chicken
wire.”</p>
<p>“I do?” Ampert doesn’t seem offended but shoots me a curious
look.</p>
<p>“What did we just discuss?” I say to Maysilee.</p>
<p>She ignores me and, uninvited, uncoils the cord from Ampert’s
neck.</p>
<p>“This is Maysilee, from back home. Looking to ally up with you.”</p>
<p>Maysilee examines the cord, testing its flexibility and twisting it
between her fingers. “You could do a braid necklace. That’s a
one-strander. It would look something like this.” She pulls out one of
her necklaces, an elaborate black braided piece. A small, shiny
medallion etched with a flower is embedded in it. “No flower,
obviously.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” says Ampert. “Can you make me one?”</p>
<p>“I guess I could, but I don’t have any tape, so you’ll need to hold
it down while I work,” she says.</p>
<p>“I’ll hold it,” he answers.</p>
<p>“And there’s nothing to hook it, so we’d have to tie it off, which is
never my first choice.”</p>
<p>Ampert digs in his pocket and holds up my safety pin from last night.
“I’ve got this.”</p>
<p>She considers it. “All right. Just be careful if you take it off or
the whole thing could unravel. Come on.” She heads for the bleachers,
not even checking if he’s following her.</p>
<p>“My father wants to meet you. He’s at the booth with the potato,”
Ampert tells me, then scurries after her.</p>
<p>His father? A potato? Doubts crowd in again. What am I doing? Is
Ampert just some deluded child who lives in a fantasy world? Before I
commit myself, I need to know. So I introduce Wyatt to Ringina — keeping
my fingers crossed that he’ll act half-normal — and head off in search
of a man with a potato.</p>
<p>After making a lap around the crowded booths, sure enough, I find
one. A small man with black hair, his back to me, leans against a
counter that holds a lone potato, no takers for his skills. I fiddle
with a strip of bandage at the neighboring first-aid booth while I
examine him. As he turns, I note the pair of steel-rimmed glasses. While
he bears a strong resemblance to Ampert, this is not why he looks
familiar. It’s Beetee, a victor from District 3.</p>
<p>A cold dread washes over me as the puzzle pieces come together.
Ampert is neither a lunatic nor a liar. His father has accompanied him
to the Capitol because he’s a victor. And therefore a mentor, assigned
to coach his own child to his death in the Fiftieth Hunger Games.</p>
<p>Why Beetee’s been tapped to man a booth with a potato, I’ve no idea,
because he’s supposed to be some kind of technological genius. The real
question is: How did Ampert end up here with him? Two tributes reaped
from one family . . . are they just the unluckiest family in Panem?</p>
<p>I give up on being covert and approach him. “You’re Ampert’s
father?”</p>
<p>“I am. And no doubt you’re wondering why I’m here, Haymitch.” Beetee
removes his glasses and polishes them on his shirt. “It’s because I’m
being punished for coming up with a plan to sabotage the Capitol’s
communication system. I’m too valuable to kill, but my son is
disposable.”</p>
<p>That pretty much answers my question. “That’s terrible. I’m so sorry.
He’s a great kid.”</p>
<p>“He is.” Beetee’s eyes find Ampert, sitting across from Maysilee on
the bleachers, chattering away while she weaves the cord into
patterns.</p>
<p>“And they made you be his mentor?” I ask.</p>
<p>“It’s part of the punishment. Watching what are almost certainly the
last hours of my son’s life. They even gave me a booth in training,
which mentors don’t traditionally attend, so I wouldn’t miss a minute.
If I wasn’t here to witness it, there would be no point.”</p>
<p>I can’t think of anything to say to comfort him, but I try. “This
isn’t your fault.”</p>
<p>“But it is. Entirely. I took a risk. I didn’t suspect that I’d been
found out until the reaping. The timing was calculated. If I had known,
I could have killed myself, and Ampert would be safe at home. That is
how Snow works.” He drops his head, resting his fingertips on the wooden
counter to steady himself. I wait for him to disintegrate, but he only
says, “Would you like to learn how to turn a potato into a battery?
Light can be important in the arena.”</p>
<p>Not really, Beetee, I think. What I’d really like to do is run away
from the raging pit of fire that is your life. But that seems cowardly.
Like what people back home are probably doing to Ma and Sid right now.
So I say, “Okay. Will there be potatoes in the arena?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I suspect this assignment was meant to demean me,
which it doesn’t. That may be its whole purpose. But if you can’t find a
potato, other things — a lemon, for instance — could work as well. Just
don’t eat anything after it’s been used as a battery.” He pulls out a
small tray with little plastic packets. Each contains a couple of nails,
a pair of copper coins, mini coils of wire, and two tiny light bulbs.
“Two potatoes would provide more power.”</p>
<p>“I guess if I can find one potato, I stand a good chance of finding
two.”</p>
<p>“If not, you might try cutting one in half.” He produces a second
potato and slides it in front of me, then offers me a thing that looks
like a pencil with a small blade on the end. “For now we’ll use both.
Follow along.”</p>
<p>Beetee tears open a packet and dumps the contents on the counter. His
eyes flick up for a second. A Peacekeeper hovers at my shoulder. The
slender knife twitches in my hand. Here I am again. Armed and with
access. “Well, it’s something to think about. . . .”</p>
<p>“Now, this battery is made up of copper, zinc, and the phosphoric
acid in the potato juice, which is an electrically conductive solution.
It makes it possible for ions to travel between the two metals. Our goal
is to create a circuit and illuminate this bulb.”</p>
<p>He’s lost me already, but I nod like he’s making sense.</p>
<p>“First, we need a space for the coin.” Beetee cuts a coin-sized slot
into the side of his potato and I copy him. “Then we wrap one of the
copper coins in wire and insert it, leaving the long tail out.”</p>
<p>I sink my wire-wrapped coin into my potato. “Does this mean it will
be dark in the arena?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I have no actual knowledge of the arena. They say if you boil
the potato, you can increase your output, so that’s something to keep in
mind.”</p>
<p>“But if I could boil a potato, I’d already have successfully made a
fire. So . . .”</p>
<p>A smile plays on his lips. “So you’d have achieved an alternate light
source, and this whole potato exercise would be a waste of your
time.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean that. Sorry.”</p>
<p>“You needn’t apologize for being astute. I’m just glad you’re paying
attention.”</p>
<p>I feel the Peacekeeper move on. “Wiress said there would be clues
about the arena in training.”</p>
<p>“Well, I would listen to her. Having been her mentor, I know how
clever she is.” He holds up a nail. “This is galvanized. Coated in zinc.
Don’t let it touch the coin. These needn’t be a coin and a nail. What
you need is copper and zinc. Strips of metal work just as well. You
might be able to forage some in the arena, if you get beneath the
scenery.” He sticks the nail into the potato, a few inches from the
coin. I follow suit.</p>
<p>“She also says every arena is just a machine.”</p>
<p>“Yes, they’re all machines of a sort.”</p>
<p>I think back to our conversation in the kitchen, when I said I wanted
to outsmart the machine and make the Capitol look stupid. Now that just
seems like an empty gesture. Wiress spent a whole Games doing that, far
better than I ever could, and what did it get us? Besides, whatever
little thing I might manage, it’d be too easy to keep off camera. The
real coup would be to . . . “So, if it’s a machine, it can be broken,
right?”</p>
<p>Beetee eyes Ampert. “Yes, in theory. Practice is always a bit
trickier. Now let’s connect our potatoes.” He attaches the wire from his
coin to my nail and links a third wire to his nail.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I remember a clip of Beetee’s Games. He somehow scavenged
parts from his arena and electrocuted all his remaining competitors. I
realize if I’m serious about breaking the machine, I will need this man
who once not only outsmarted, but hijacked his own arena. Because even
if I’m naturally smart enough, I’m still just a poorly educated boy from
the hills, who had no idea you could turn a potato into a battery.</p>
<p>“How, Beetee? How can I break it?” I say under my breath. “I don’t
know anything about machines.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you do without realizing it. A screw is a simple machine. A
wheel and axle. A lever. Are you familiar with a water pump?”</p>
<p>“Too familiar.”</p>
<p>“That’s a lever. It helps create a partial vacuum and water is drawn
upward. Some machines take more know-how than others.”</p>
<p>“I know how a white liquor still works. Does that count?”</p>
<p>I catch a ghost of a smile. “I don’t see why not.” Beetee takes the
wire from my coin and the one from his nail and attaches them each to
one of the little wires poking out of the base of a tiny bulb. “And here
we go.” It emits a faint glow.</p>
<p>Ma would love this. Think of the money we could save on candles. But
this will not destroy an arena.</p>
<p>“What would break it, Beetee?” I press.</p>
<p>Beetee leans over, lifts his glasses, and peers under them as he
scrutinizes the battery. “The circuit? Well, you’d only need to
disconnect one piece — say, remove a wire — and the whole battery goes
dead.” I realize there’s another Peacekeeper behind me, and Beetee’s
words are for her benefit. “Remember, we’re converting chemical energy
into electrical energy to illuminate the bulb. You need to keep the
circular path intact.”</p>
<p>The Peacekeeper moves in closer, her nose inches from the battery
now, her interest attracting a quartet of tributes in peach outfits.
District 8. My unofficial allies, if things work out.</p>
<p>“Can we try that?” one asks.</p>
<p>“Of course,” says Beetee. “Well, thank you for dropping by, Haymitch.
Come back if you’d like to practice. And happy belated sixteenth
birthday.” I guess Ampert told him. He holds out his hand for me to
shake. “That’s funny. I was reaped the day you were born.”</p>
<p>As I grasp his hand, I feel something, palm it, and conceal it in my
pocket. “Thanks, sir,” I say before walking away, my fingers probing the
plastic packet, bumpy with coins and nails. A little birthday present
from Beetee. If I can find some way to smuggle it into the arena,
convince people I scavenged the stuff — the coins might be tricky but I
can maybe dig up some other copper — and find a potato, I’ll be halfway
to a really dim bulb. I’m pretty sure my flint striker’s a faster route
to light, but possibly those kids from 8 could use it.</p>
<p>Up on the bleachers, Maysilee puts the finishing touches on an
expertly woven braided necklace. Truly, it could pass as anyone’s token
from home. She holds it up for inspection.</p>
<p>Ampert strokes it in admiration. “It’s beautiful. And perfectly
symmetrical. I wouldn’t believe it’s all one strand. You’re really
clever!”</p>
<p>“And you have good taste,” she says, slipping it over his head.</p>
<p>“I wish you were my sister,” he says simply.</p>
<p>A funny look crosses her face. Bet she’s never heard those words
before. I wait for a cutting remark, but she only says, “I’ll be your
sister.”</p>
<p>“Great. I’m going to show my father!” Ampert gives her a hug, which
she stiffly returns, then runs off.</p>
<p>Her brow wrinkles. “His father?”</p>
<p>“It really is his pa,” I tell her. “Remember Beetee, the victor from
District Three? Got out of line. They’re punishing him by making him
mentor Ampert.”</p>
<p>“That’s a special kind of vicious. Would you want your family to be
here?”</p>
<p>“I can’t think of anything worse.”</p>
<p>A Gamemaker announces lunch and we’re directed back to our assigned
bleachers, where a Peacekeeper delivers four boxes. I’m still full of
breakfast, my gut hurts from Panache’s attack, and the sight of
Louella’s unclaimed lunch box kills my remaining appetite.</p>
<p>A parade of blue, brown, peach, and red uniforms makes its way to the
foot of our bleachers. I sort out 3, 7, 8, 10.</p>
<p>“Can we join you?” asks Ampert.</p>
<p>“Sure,” I say. If they’re going to be our allies, be good if we can
bond a little. They clamber up beside us and everybody shares their
names, most of which I immediately forget. The kids from 10 are bruised
and scabby from the chariot debacle but look like a sturdy enough
bunch.</p>
<p>From the next section, District 11 pretends to ignore us, but as
they’ve all gone quiet, I guess they’re eavesdropping. Trying to figure
out what kind of allies we’d make.</p>
<p>“Ampert, this is your show,” I say. “Why don’t you tell us what
you’ve got in mind?”</p>
<p>I like how even though he’s only twelve, he jumps right in. “It’s
like this. A disproportionate amount of the time, the Careers win. But
they’re only one quarter of the tributes. We’ve got three times their
numbers. So the idea is, we get the rest of us together and, for a
change, we hunt them down instead of letting them hunt us.”</p>
<p>“Can we do that, do you think?” asks a girl from 10.</p>
<p>“Why not, Lannie?” replies Ampert.</p>
<p>Why not? I think about how the districts outnumber the Capitol by far
more than three to one.</p>
<p>“We don’t have to buy into their mind game, that somehow they will
always defeat us,” Ampert declares. “Everyone acts like the odds aren’t
in our favor, but I’m sure we can beat those odds!”</p>
<p>At the word odds, Wyatt seems to blink awake. “Well, we’d have to
factor in their stature, training, temperament, and sponsor gifts. But
even given that, if there are enough of us . . .” His eyes get a faraway
look.</p>
<p>“Yeah, this is normal for him,” I tell the group. “He’s working out
the odds of the twelve Careers against the rest of us.” Everyone waits
respectfully.</p>
<p>“Yes, it can be done. We could do it. It’s still not a probability,
but it’s a solid possibility,” reports Wyatt. “Especially if we can get
all nine districts to agree.”</p>
<p>“If we kill all the Careers,” asks Ringina, “what do the rest of us
do then?”</p>
<p>“Have another meeting,” says Maysilee. “At least this alliance gives
us something to do besides freak out.”</p>
<p>“Right now, we don’t have nine districts, though,” Wyatt reminds us.
“Just five.”</p>
<p>“I’ve asked the others, but not everybody wants to join,” says
Ampert. Our attention turns to the bleachers stretching across the gym.
At the far end, the Careers mirror us, having assembled for lunch. Snot
green mixed with the purple of 2 and 4’s deep-sea blue. Districts 11, 9,
6, and 5 remain unattached. We watch as a few members of the Careers
toss their empty lunch boxes to the gym floor, then walk down to where
District 6 sits and steal a couple of the kids’ lunches. Games or no
Games, if you’ve got a decent bone in your body, you hate a bully.</p>
<p>District 6 is composed of four puny kids whose rickety limbs suggest
they’ve never seen sunlight. Victims of last night’s chariot episode,
they’re bandaged in enough gauze to choke a horse. One has a twisted
foot, and I remember another collapsing on the shower floor, wheezing
from the insecticide. I’m tempted to write them off entirely—what could
they possibly bring to the alliance except neediness? But I snag on the
shade of their outfits. Dove color. Seems like a sign.</p>
<p>“Six said no?” I ask Ampert.</p>
<p>“They said they want to remain neutral so the Careers don’t target
them.”</p>
<p>“We can see how that’s working out,” I say.</p>
<p>A bone-thin little girl in Lenore Dove’s color collapses on the
bleachers, sobbing. I grab my untouched lunch box, scoop up Louella’s,
and make my way down the bleachers. The crying girl recoils as I
approach, and I hold out Louella’s lunch. “Here. We had a couple
extras.” She hesitates, then takes the box with a shaking hand. The
wheezing boy accepts the other. “You all managing after the
accident?”</p>
<p>The girl nods. “We’re sorry our chariot hurt your friend.”</p>
<p>Frail she is, but considerate. “Not your fault. Never thought for a
minute it was.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for not blaming us,” she says.</p>
<p>“Blaming you? Seems like we’re all in this together,” I say. “You
know, we’ve got a pretty good alliance in the works. I understand you’re
trying to stay neutral, but really that just makes you a target for
everybody. Anyway, the invite’s still good.”</p>
<p>By the time I make it back to my gang, four broken doves are on my
tail. They perch on the seats, whisper their names — Wellie, the crying
girl; Miles, the asthmatic boy; Atread and Velo, the remaining boy and
girl. Then they dig in to their lunches.</p>
<p>“Six makes six,” says Wyatt.</p>
<p>“We need a name,” says Ringina. “If they’re the Careers, who are
we?”</p>
<p>People toss out ideas for names. Now that we’re allies, District 12
offers Loose Cannons, 10 comes up with Dark Horses, and 7 volunteers
Invaders.</p>
<p>“No,” says Wellie, intensely. “Those all sound like we’re trying to
be tough. But we’re not tough compared to the Careers. What we are is
inexperienced, not trained from birth to win the Games.”</p>
<p>“Is that a good selling point?” asks Lannie.</p>
<p>“In a way,” says Ampert. “For one thing, it means we haven’t spent
our whole lives buying into the Games as something we aspire to.”</p>
<p>“We’re not collaborators,” says Ringina.</p>
<p>“Right. But we’ll fight if we have to,” says Ampert. “We need a good
name for people who are just starting something hard. A district
name.”</p>
<p>“Like Neddie Newcomer,” I say without hesitation. The others laugh.
“No, it’s a real thing. In the mines, if you’ve just started, they call
you Neddie Newcomer. My pa used to call me that whenever he’d teach me
something new. Like, ‘Come on, Neddie Newcomer, let’s learn to tie those
boots.’”</p>
<p>“I like it,” says Wellie, a smile transforming her tear-stained face.
“We’re the Newcomers.”</p>
<p>Ringina thinks it over, then grins. “And proud of it.”</p>
<p>Everything feels better after lunch. It’s less that I don’t have to
fear half the tributes than that I don’t have to think about killing
them. The latter is much worse. Now I can join my allies at the booths
and know they’ve got my back as we learn to make snares, throw axes, and
set a broken leg.</p>
<p>The four tributes from 6 stick to me like glue. My own little
dove-colored flock. I hope they don’t all think I can protect them when
we hit the arena, because I can’t.</p>
<p>Wyatt seems to have found his people. Ampert’s co-tributes from 3
have a fascination with his odds system, and he seems happy to share it
with them. Number freaks find one another, I guess.</p>
<p>It’s Maysilee who surprises me. Back home, she isn’t popular, she’s
known. She’s not respected, she’s feared. Not deferred to, but avoided.
Here, following Ampert’s lead, kids bring her their district trinkets
and ask her to make them special, and she agrees. The girl must know
fifty ways to braid, twist, and loop a cord into a piece of finery. She
sets off their humble offerings from home with her fancy patterns.
District pride runs deep. From 6, which covers transportation, Wellie
has an old bicycle bell, Miles a tin train whistle. Livestock-loving
District 10 brought horseshoes; the lumberjacks of 7, carved wooden
trinkets. The girls from District 8 have little dolls in beautifully
sewn outfits. A kid from 3 has a doorknob, but I’m not sure how that
reflects technology. Whatever they present her with, Maysilee gives
dignity to their tokens, and even though she still offers a fair amount
of unsolicited fashion advice — two girls change their hairstyles and a
boy promises to stop biting his nails — our allies adore her.</p>
<p>By the end of the training session, District 11 hasn’t said yes, but
they haven’t said no either. If they’re in, I wish they’d say so. We
could use more brawn. I saw Hull, the guy who kicked Panache in the
shower, fling a pitchfork and decapitate a dummy. Why pretend that’s not
what we’re here for?</p>
<p>All of us Newcomers stand a little bit straighter by the time we head
back to our vans. Even locked in the dark, Maysilee, Wyatt, and I
continue to make plans, sharing information about our allies and working
on a strategy. In no time at all, the van pulls to a stop.</p>
<p>“That was quick,” says Maysilee.</p>
<p>The door swings open, and a Peacekeeper gestures for me to get out.
Wyatt makes to follow, but the Peacekeeper holds up a hand. “No, just
Abernathy.”</p>
<p>This isn’t good. I slide out of the van in front of a white marble
building, far more imposing than our tribute apartment. It stretches the
length of the block, a single structure accessed by a huge pair of
wooden doors inlaid with a pattern of golden stars. I catch a glimpse of
Wyatt’s furrowed brow as the door slams shut and the van speeds away.
What’s going on? Where am I?</p>
<p>Two men in violet uniforms stand in silent attendance at the
entrance. As if responding to some unheard signal, they haul open the
doors to reveal Plutarch Heavensbee. He approaches me, his face
unreadable.</p>
<p>“Hello, Haymitch. I’m afraid there’s been a last-minute schedule
change.”</p>
<p>“Just for me?”</p>
<p>“Just for you. It seems the president had second thoughts about your
. . . performance.”</p>
<p>Louella under the balcony. Snow up above. While I applauded for all
the Capitol to see.</p>
<p>Plutarch doesn’t need to explain further. This is where I pay for
painting my poster.</p>
