<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>After a while, I slide down the wall, cradling my swollen hands,
panting. Pain stabs my chest, and I wonder if a person’s heart can
really break. Probably. The word brokenhearted had to come from
somewhere. I imagine my heart busted into a dozen glassy red pieces,
their hard, jagged edges stabbing into my flesh at every beat. It may
not be scientific, but it matches what I feel. Part of me thinks I will
die right now, bleeding out on the inside. But it isn’t going to be that
simple. Eventually, my breathing slows, and a general despair
descends.</p>
<p>I will never see Lenore Dove again. Never hear her laugh coming from
high above me in the branches. Never feel the warmth of her in my arms
as we lay on a bed of pine needles, my lips pressed into the hollow of
her neck. Never pull a stray goose feather from her hair, or listen to
her play her tune box, or press my finger into the crease that forms
between her eyebrows when she’s puzzling out a thought. Never see her
face brighten at a bag of gumdrops or a full moon or the sound of me
whispering, “I love you like all-fire.”</p>
<p>It’s all been taken away. My love, my home, my ma, my sweet little
brother . . . why did I tell him he’s the man of the house now? That
wasn’t fair. It’s too much for someone so young and hopeful to shoulder.
My mamaw on Pa’s side used to say Sid was born looking on the sunny
side. I think he’s missed a lot of trouble down here on earth, because
he’s always studying the sky. He’s fascinated by the sun, the clouds,
the bodies that come out at night. Tam Amber taught Lenore Dove about
the stars, as the Covey used to navigate by them long ago, and she
taught Sid. On a clear night, he drags us all outside to see the
pictures they make. “There’s the water dipper, just like ours in the
bucket. That over there’s the bowhunter. He looks like Burdock, don’t
you think? That one’s a swan, but Lenore Dove says she calls it a goose.
And that’s yours, Ma. See the W? That’s yours. W for your name,
Willamae, and flipped around it’s an M for Ma!”</p>
<p>And Ma always looks pleased, because when does she get anything nice,
let alone something so fine as her own set of stars? It’s all about her
giving things to us. I pretended not to see her bring in a chicken last
night that I’m sure she planned to fry for my birthday. Probably took on
extra wash to afford it. Will she be able to make ends meet without my
wages from Hattie? She will, or she’ll die trying. Ma . . . oh, Ma . .
.</p>
<p>Plutarch was right. I did mess up. Big-time. And I will pay for it
with my death and with the broken hearts and lives of everyone who loves
me.</p>
<p>I stare out at the trees flying by. I always thought if one of us
shook free of 12, it would be Lenore Dove. Her people were great
travelers once, going from district to district to perform their music.
Tam Amber remembers it, as he was about my age when the war ended and
the Peacekeepers rounded up the Covey, killing all the adults and
confining the kids to our district. Nothing Lenore Dove loves better
than those stories of the old days, with her kin rattling around in a
broken-down pickup. When fuel got scarce, they resorted to hitching it
up to a team of horses. By the time they were herded into 12, the team
was pulling an old wagon and most of them were on foot, but they were
making it work. Cooking over open fires, rolling into towns, playing in
warehouses like the Hob, or fields if none were available, famous in
their way to the locals. I’m sure their life had its trials, but she has
such a romantic view of it, I never mention that. Returning to it is
impossible, since no one can leave 12, and her uncles would never
entertain the idea of hitting the road again. But Lenore Dove’s
convinced there must be people outside of Panem, far to the north.
Sometimes she takes to disappearing deep in the woods, and I worry she’s
not coming back. Not really, but a little. Guess I can let that go
now.</p>
<p>Either we outrun the storm or it outruns us. The lingering raindrops
on the window make me think about the cistern, and how I ran off to see
Lenore Dove instead of going home to fill it. I don’t regret that
precious final rendezvous with my love, but I wish I could’ve left Sid
and Ma with a full tank, not just the few gallons the rain barrel might
provide. Not that I think Ma will be able to do laundry this week. Or, I
don’t know, maybe she will. She didn’t miss a beat when Pa died. Just
made a giant pot of bean and ham hock soup, the way we do in the Seam
when someone dies, and got back to work. I remember sitting by the
stove, my tears splashing on the floor a few inches from a puddle under
a miner’s shirt. In winter, clothes have to be hung inside to dry.
Something’s always dripping.</p>
<p>The train keeps rolling on, putting miles between me and everything
I’ve ever known or loved or hoped for. Dreams of one day letting Ma quit
the laundry business. Leaning on Sid about his schoolwork so he might
get a coveted aboveground mine job — like keeping books or loading
trains — where he could always lay eyes on the sky. And a life with
Lenore Dove, loving her, marrying her, raising up our kids, her teaching
them music and me doing whatever, digging coal or making white liquor —
it wouldn’t have mattered if she was with me. All gone, all lost.</p>
<p>Woodbine no longer seems reckless since he got to die in 12 and not
in some sadistic arena out west like I will. A few years ago, the arena
would go darkish without warning, and these giant coal-black weasels
would melt right out of the shadows and attack the tributes. I think of
those pointy teeth ripping off the face of the girl from District 5 . .
.</p>
<p>I should’ve run. Should’ve let the Peacekeepers blow off my head on
the square. Plenty of things are worse than a quick, clean death. By
now, I might be wrapped in white linen, sleeping with my kin under the
Abernathy headstone. We don’t tend to let bodies ripen in the heat.</p>
<p>Several hours pass before a key’s turned in the lock and Plutarch
sticks his head in my compartment.</p>
<p>“Feel up to joining the others?”</p>
<p>He says this like I’m recovering from a bellyache, not from being
tased and torn from my life. I don’t know what to make of this Plutarch.
I hate him for forcing Ma and Sid to playact for the cameras. But he did
let me hug them when Drusilla said I couldn’t. And he probably saved
Lenore Dove’s life by asking to keep her for the tearful good-bye. He’s
as unpredictable as lightning. Might be worth staying on his good
side.</p>
<p>Besides, I need to check on Louella. I’m all she’s got now.</p>
<p>“Sure,” I say.</p>
<p>Plutarch orders the Peacekeepers to uncuff me, then leads me down the
rocking hallway of the train to another compartment. Molded plastic
seats in an array of neon colors line the sides of the car. I slide in
next to Louella, across from Wyatt and Maysilee.</p>
<p>“Anybody hungry?” asks Plutarch. No one replies. “Let me see what’s
cooking.” He withdraws, locking the car door.</p>
<p>I nudge Louella with my elbow. “Hey, girl.” I offer her my hand.</p>
<p>Hers slips into mine, icy cold. “Hey, Hay,” she whispers. “Wasn’t
fair how they took you.”</p>
<p>For the first time, I consider this. Fair? It sure wasn’t. My reaping
was irregular, maybe even illegal. But the number of people in the
Capitol to whom I could plead my case is exactly zero. I’m nothing but
an amusing tale for Drusilla to tell between the caviar and the cream
puffs.</p>
<p>“For me or anybody else,” I tell Louella. Her little face is so
pinched that before I really think it through, I ask, “So, are you going
to be my ally or what, sweetheart?”</p>
<p>She actually smiles. It’s an old joke. When she was five and I was
eight, she decided she was my sweetheart and trailed after me, telling
anyone who’d listen. It lasted about a week, then she transferred her
affections to a boy named Buster who gave her a bullfrog. I think her
heart would’ve moved on anyway, as you’re probably not too stuck on
someone you have burping contests with, but we’re still good buddies. If
I had a little sister her age, I’d want her to be just like Louella, and
I’ve harbored the hope that she’d wait for Sid to grow up before
settling on a real sweetheart. Now, of course, her chances of growing up
are nil. She’s frozen forever at thirteen.</p>
<p>“I’ll be your ally,” she says. “You and me, we can trust each
other.”</p>
<p>You might think this would kick off a general District 12 alliance,
but as I consider the other candidates, I’m not sure that’s desirable. I
can’t get a read on Wyatt. On the one hand, that blank stare doesn’t
suggest a lively mind. On the other, he’s fairly good-sized and I’ve
never heard anything bad about him, which is more than I can say for
Maysilee. I have no shortage of information on her, most of it gathered
firsthand, and none of it flattering.</p>
<p>Maysilee Donner — where to begin? Right from when we started school,
she and Merrilee made an impression on me. Not just because of their
town ways, but because my ma had recently lost a set of twins. Two
little girls, tiny things that came too early. She grieved them mightily
in her way, scrubbing clothes against her washboard until they shredded,
and while Pa was never one to show his feelings, I heard him bawling
when he thought I was asleep. The Donner twins have always held a
certain fascination for me, as I wondered what my own sisters might’ve
been like. Not like the Donners, I hope. I guess Merrilee isn’t too bad,
except she tends to go along with everything Maysilee does. And
Maysilee’s been too good for the rest of us from day one. Prissing
around in her shiny shoes and nail polish, and never without some kind
of ornament. How that girl loves jewelry.</p>
<p>I look at her now, staring out the train window, her fingers entwined
in the strands of a half dozen necklaces. Some beaded, some braided
cord, some with trinkets hanging off of them, and at least one real
gold. While Seam folk might have a treasured ornament or two, nobody has
six necklaces. And if they did, they wouldn’t show off by wearing them
all at once.</p>
<p>Plutarch slides open the door and steps back to admit a Capitol
attendant bearing a tray heaped with sandwiches. Each one’s loaded with
a day’s wages of meat — fresh ham or roast beef or chicken cut thin and
piled high — and sports a small paper flag of Panem on top. My mouth
starts watering and I realize I haven’t eaten since breakfast.</p>
<p>The attendant offers the tray to Louella, who hesitates, overwhelmed
by the bounty before her. The McCoys can go weeks without meat, and what
they do get generally comes from a tin. The attendant registers her
discomfort and adopts a patronizing tone. “Is there a problem,
miss?”</p>
<p>Louella reddens — the McCoys don’t lack pride — but before she can
answer, Maysilee snaps, “Of course there’s a problem! Do you expect her
to eat with her hands? Or don’t you have plates and silverware in the
Capitol?”</p>
<p>Now it’s the attendant’s turn to blush. He stammers out, “They’re
just sandwiches. I mean . . . people pick them up.”</p>
<p>“Without even a napkin?” asks Maysilee. “I seriously doubt that.”</p>
<p>The attendant turns to Plutarch, thrown. “Do they get napkins?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. They’re our guests, Tibby,” says Plutarch mildly. “I’ve
got to check on something in the kitchen. Let’s see if we can scrounge
up a few plates, too. Excuse us.”</p>
<p>When the door clicks shut, I can’t help laughing.</p>
<p>“Shut up,” says Maysilee. “Listen, Louella, if you let them treat you
like an animal, they will. So don’t let them.”</p>
<p>It’s a little too much for Louella. Her eyes narrow and she retorts,
“I wasn’t planning to. Somebody cut me off.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” says Maysilee. “You don’t need my help.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need help from anybody who said my sister uses coal dust for
powder,” Louella tells her.</p>
<p>Maysilee smiles a little, remembering. “She got a lot cleaner after
that.”</p>
<p>This reminds me of when I was six and got chiggers and Maysilee
nicknamed me “Itchy Itchy Haymitchy.” Nobody would come near me for two
weeks, even though I told them it wasn’t contagious. That name still
makes me cringe ten years later.</p>
<p>Any inclination I had to team up with Maysilee disappears. “She’s
making this ally thing easy for us,” I say to Louella.</p>
<p>“She sure is.” Louella crosses her arms. Then something catches her
eye and she frowns.</p>
<p>I follow her gaze to Wyatt, who looks as remote as ever, his eyes
fixed on a sign on the door that reads watch your step. There’s a glint
in the evening sunlight; he’s knuckle rolling a scrip coin in a smooth,
practiced fashion. At the click of the key in the latch, the coin
vanishes.</p>
<p>Tibby wheels in a cart laden with the dinner stuff. Everything seems
to be made of plastic in this train: cart, seats, utensils, cups,
plates. Easy to spray down and sanitize after we’re out, I guess.</p>
<p>“I checked. And there’s a surprise for dessert,” Plutarch teases from
the door.</p>
<p>Like we need any more surprises today.</p>
<p>Tibby hovers over Louella. “What can I get you? We have chicken, ham,
and roast beef.”</p>
<p>“Ham,” says Louella.</p>
<p>“Sure you won’t try a roast beef as well? The chef uses a marinade
that makes it rather special,” says Tibby.</p>
<p>“Why not?” Louella accepts her plate, napkin, utensils, and a bottle
of lemonade.</p>
<p>When Tibby turns to Maysilee, his solicitousness vanishes. “And
you?”</p>
<p>Maysilee takes her time considering the platter. “The roast beef, as
rare as you have it.” She spreads her napkin out to protect her skirt,
then arranges her utensils on it. “Trays wouldn’t be unheard of, but
never mind.”</p>
<p>When Wyatt and I have received loaded plates — I order all three
sandwiches — the attendant and Plutarch withdraw. I look at Maysilee,
who’s daintily cutting hers into tiny bites and spearing them with her
fork. Believe me, no one else in Panem — not Capitol or district — eats
a sandwich like that. I decide to start with the ham and take a big
bite. Boy, it’s good. Smoky, salty, and drizzled with something that
tastes like Ma’s chow-chow. I notice Louella peeking under the top layer
of bread.</p>
<p>“Go on, eat up,” I tell her. My ally could use some meat on her
bones. She digs in.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long for me to polish off my sandwiches and drain my
lemonade bottle. The food lifts my spirits a bit. Maybe there’s a way
out of this. Like we make a break for it and jump from the train. As I
puzzle over how we might achieve this, Plutarch reappears and invites us
to move to the lounge car with him. In the hall, I check for possible
escape routes, but Peacekeepers block every potential exit.</p>
<p>We relocate to the back of the train where an area’s done up like a
sitting room. The plastic-upholstered furniture is softer and stickier
than our compartment seats. Capitol News plays on a screen built into
the wall, and the recap of today’s reaping begins by the time we’ve
settled in.</p>
<p>“I’ve been working on the District Twelve segment all afternoon,”
says Plutarch. “Gave it the old Heavensbee spin. You four come off
beautifully.”</p>
<p>Drusilla totters in the door, a tall red drink garnished with
vegetables in her hand. The front of her yellow military jacket, now
unbuttoned, keeps flapping open to reveal her undergarments.</p>
<p>Plutarch offers her a chair. “Saved you the best seat.”</p>
<p>She collapses into it, pulls a stalk of celery from her drink, and
chomps on it. “How old did I look today, Plutarch?”</p>
<p>“Not a day over thirty,” Plutarch promises. “Everybody commented on
it.”</p>
<p>“Well, you get what you pay for,” she slurs, gingerly probing her
cheekbone with the celery. She points at the screen and laughs. “Ha!
There’s Juvenia! Little Miss Perfect didn’t get any cloud cover. She
looks ghastly, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Juvenia, a pint-sized lady in six-inch heels and pink polka dots,
begins calling names in District 1. The program moves on, and they air
every district’s drawing. Besides us, forty-four tributes were reaped
today, half girls, half boys, of every shape and size. As usual, the
kids from Districts 1, 2, and 4 live up to their nickname as the
Careers, which means they seem to have been training for the Hunger
Games since birth. Here and there, chance has thrown in some additional
brawny kids, but plenty of scrawny ones balance them out. On the
brawny-to-scrawny scale, I do okay, largely because of all those bags of
grain I haul for Hattie. But some of those Careers could crush me like a
bug. And Louella’s yet to get her growth.</p>
<p>As a strapping boy mounts the stage in District 11, Drusilla states
the obvious. “You lot better be able to run.” She doesn’t even say this
in a mean way, which makes it scarier.</p>
<p>“Other factors besides size come into play. Brains, skills, strategy.
And never rule out luck,” says Plutarch. “Your mentors will talk you
through everything.”</p>
<p>Our mentors. Our guides, our masterminds, our protectors in the
Hunger Games. Except the District 12 tributes don’t have automatic
mentors, not even one, because we’re the only district without living
victors, and that’s who the job traditionally falls to.</p>
<p>In fifty years, we’ve only had one victor, and that was a long time
ago. A girl who no one seems to know anything about. Back then, barely
anyone in 12 had a television, so the Games were mostly hearsay. I’ve
never seen her in the clips of the old shows, but then those early
efforts are rarely featured, as they are said to be badly filmed and
lacking in spectacle. My parents weren’t born yet, and even Mamaw
couldn’t tell me much about the girl. I brought our victor up with
Lenore Dove a few times, but she never wanted to discuss her.</p>
<p>“Who are our mentors anyway?” I ask.</p>
<p>“They’re in the process of selecting them from the pool of victors
not tapped to oversee their own district tributes,” says Plutarch.
“Don’t worry, some very talented candidates are in the running.”</p>
<p>Yeah. Candidates who would be pariahs if they led a District 12
tribute to victory while their own district’s tributes died. Most years,
I don’t even hear about who ends up mentoring the kids from 12. Let’s
face it, we’re on our own.</p>
<p>Drusilla lets out a gasp. “Daylight is murder!”</p>
<p>They’ve cut to District 12, where our fates were sealed.</p>
<p>“And yet, you’re luminous,” Plutarch assures her.</p>
<p>I watch, both fascinated and sickened by the flawless transition from
Maysilee’s drawing to Wyatt’s and mine. Not even a hint of Woodbine’s
shooting or the turmoil that followed. And there’s my name, and there’s
me, and there’s Ma gasping, Sid crying, Lenore Dove with her hand
clasped over her mouth.</p>
<p>“That’s not what happened,” I say.</p>
<p>“None of the footage has been tampered with — not really time to do
that properly,” says Plutarch. “I just did a little card- stacking to
help you out.”</p>
<p>“You did what?” asks Louella.</p>
<p>Before he can answer, Wyatt, who hasn’t opened his mouth except to
eat since 12, weighs in. “He stacked the deck in our favor. He shuffled
the shots around to give us an advantage.”</p>
<p>Plutarch beams at him. “Exactly!”</p>
<p>A corner of Louella’s mouth twists down. “You mean, like in card
games. When people gamble. Isn’t that cheating?”</p>
<p>“It is and it isn’t,” says Plutarch. “Look, we need to sell you to
the sponsors. If I showed the audience what really happened — the Chance
boy’s head being blown off, the crowd control, Haymitch attacking the
Peacekeepers —”</p>
<p>I object. “I didn’t attack anyone. They attacked my girl and I
stepped in.”</p>
<p>“Same thing,” says Drusilla. “You’re not allowed to interfere with
our Peacekeepers.”</p>
<p>“I’m trying to show you in the best possible light,” says
Plutarch.</p>
<p>Maysilee rolls her eyes. “Like when our shop calls stale marshmallows
‘chewy.’ And then charges an extra penny for them.”</p>
<p>I scowl at her. I’ve fallen for that “chewy” marshmallow scam more
than once.</p>
<p>“Stress the positive, ignore the negative,” says Plutarch.</p>
<p>“Instead of four violent district piglets who hate the Capitol —”
Drusilla begins.</p>
<p>“You’re a quartet of attractive kids who hop right up there on that
stage to the cheers of your district, raring to go!” finishes
Plutarch.</p>
<p>“You should be down on your knees kissing this man’s feet. Maybe you
won’t get any sponsors, but at least you haven’t repelled them. He’s
given you a total makeover,” says Drusilla.</p>
<p>“You mean, he’s given the Capitol a total makeover,” scoffs Maysilee.
“Made you look competent when you couldn’t even pull off the
reaping.”</p>
<p>“I like to think it was mutually beneficial,” says Plutarch. “And the
audience is none the wiser. I saw to that.”</p>
<p>I’m entirely the Capitol’s plaything. They will use me for their
entertainment and then kill me, and the truth will have no say in it.
Plutarch acts friendly, but his indulgences — my family’s good-byes, his
fancy sandwiches — are just a method to manage me, because happy
playthings are easier to handle than raging ones. To get his footage,
he’ll indulge me right into the arena.</p>
<p>As if to confirm this, the door to the sitting room bursts open to
reveal Tibby, his face aglow with the sixteen candles on a giant
birthday cake.</p>
