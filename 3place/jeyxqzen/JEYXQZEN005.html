<h4 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h4>
<p>We don’t do birthday cakes in my house. Seems wrong on reaping day,
and Ma thinks it’s unfair for her and Sid to have a cake if I don’t.
Instead, she makes something nice for breakfast, like the corn bread and
sauce, and saves all of her cake energy for New Year’s Day.</p>
<p>She starts setting things aside months in advance: the dried apples,
the sorghum syrup, the white flour. The spices — ginger and cinnamon and
whatnot — are so costly she buys them in little twists of paper from the
Marches’ apothecary. A couple days before New Year’s, she makes the
apple filling and bakes the six layers of cake, and alternates them —
cake, filling, cake, filling, until it’s in one big beautiful stack. She
wraps it all up in a towel so it can rest, and that sweet apple filling
soaks into the cake. Then, on New Year’s Day at suppertime, she pours
everybody a big glass of buttermilk and we eat all the stack cake that
we can hold.</p>
<p>So the cake in front of me, with its fancy frosted flowers, is all
wrong. The candles smack of the Capitol. And the song Tibby leads the
Peacekeepers in, while common in 12, is never sung in my house because
it would be as unsuitable as a birthday cake.</p>
<p>Happy birthday</p>
<p>To someone special!</p>
<p>And we wish you many more!</p>
<p>Once a year</p>
<p>We give a cheer</p>
<p>To you, Hay-ay-ay-mitch!</p>
<p>Happy birthday!</p>
<p>The cameraman from Plutarch’s crew, sneaking his lens over Tibby’s
shoulder to film my reaction, is the cherry on the birthday cake fiasco.
Clearly, Plutarch wants to capture my delight so he can broadcast it all
over Panem. Look how well the Capitol treats the tributes. How forgiving
they are to their enemies. How superior they are to those district
piglets in their stinkholes.</p>
<p>I’ve seen similar clips before of the tributes being treated like
pampered pets. Being brushed and fed and flattered, lapping it up.
Playing into the Capitol propaganda. Maybe it gets them more sponsors,
but if they do win, it’s not going to get them a parade back home.</p>
<p>“Don’t let them use you, Sarshee. Don’t let them paint their posters
with your blood. Not if you can help it.”</p>
<p>That’s it. That’s what Pa told Sarshee in the Justice Building.
That’s what Ma wanted me to remember. Even though — maybe especially
because — she had just let Plutarch use her and Sid like puppets. She
had failed, but wanted me to be strong.</p>
<p>Plutarch had my family over a barrel when we were desperate for one
last embrace, but now he’s got nothing I want. I rise as I weigh my
options. I could knock the cake to the ground, hawk and spit on it, or
just shove it into Tibby’s stupid face. Instead, I go all Maysilee
Donner, turning my back and walking over to look out the window.</p>
<p>In the reflection, I see Tibby deflate. “It has pineapple filling?”
he offers.</p>
<p>I give my head a slight shake.</p>
<p>“A miscalculation on my part,” Plutarch says. “Take it out, Tibby.
I’m sorry, Haymitch.”</p>
<p>An apology? From a Capitol guy? Then I see it for what it is: another
way to manipulate me by pretending I’m a human being, worthy of an
apology. I don’t even acknowledge it.</p>
<p>It makes me feel pretty bad, though. That cake. The last thing I
needed was a big Capitol reminder that this would be my final birthday.
The same goes for all of us. And while we’re not all allies, I
appreciate that no one’s shouted out, “Well, hold on, I’ll take a
piece!”</p>
<p>After my cake and Capitol well-wishers have withdrawn, Plutarch
continues. “Back to business. Along with your mentors, District Twelve
will be assigned its very own stylist.”</p>
<p>“And not a moment too soon.” Drusilla snorts and gives Louella’s
gingham dress an appraising look. “Honestly, where do you people find
these things?”</p>
<p>“My ma made it,” says Louella evenly. “Where did you find yours?”</p>
<p>Louella’s holding her own, but Maysilee lands the insult. “I was
wondering the same. It’s like someone mated a Peacekeeper and a canary
and . . . there you are.”</p>
<p>“What?” says Drusilla. She rises from her chair but wobbles a bit
before she finds her balance on her spiked heels.</p>
<p>“Careful,” says Maysilee. She drips sugar as she goes for the
jugular. “Might be time to rethink those boots. Wouldn’t something
closer to the ground be safer for a person your age?”</p>
<p>Drusilla hauls off and slaps Maysilee, who, without missing a beat,
slaps her right back. A real wallop. Drusilla’s knocked off her boots
and into the chair I recently vacated. Everyone freezes and I wonder if
we’re about to be executed on the spot.</p>
<p>“Don’t you ever touch me again,” says Maysilee. The color’s gone from
her face except for the print of Drusilla’s hand. You got to hand it to
Maysilee, nobody’s using footage of her for propaganda.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we all take a deep breath?” Plutarch suggests. “It’s been
a tough day. Everybody’s emotions are running high and —!”</p>
<p>Drusilla flies up, rips the riding crop from its boot clip, and
begins beating Maysilee, who cries out and raises her arms to protect
her head. But the blows keep raining down, forcing her to the floor.</p>
<p>“Drusilla! Stop! Drusilla, we have to put her on camera tomorrow!”
Plutarch warns. He has to summon two Peacekeepers from the hallway to
pull her off.</p>
<p>“Nasty, disgusting creature,” Drusilla pants. “I will destroy you
before you even make it to the arena.”</p>
<p>The welts have already risen on Maysilee’s arms and neck, but she
ignores them. I doubt she’s ever been hit before, let alone whipped. I
haven’t much either. Mamaw used to cuff me on the head, but it was more
to get my attention than to hurt me. Maysilee slowly pushes herself up
from the floor, using the wall for support, before she responds.
“Really? How? You’re not a Gamemaker. You’re not even a stylist. You’re
nothing but a low-rent escort hanging on by your fingernails to the
trashiest district in Panem.”</p>
<p>This hits a nerve. Fear flickers across Drusilla’s face before she
recovers. “And you’re headed for a bloody and agonizing death.”</p>
<p>Maysilee gives a bitter laugh. “That’s right. I am. So why should I
care what you say? Unless I win, of course. But even then, who do you
think will be more popular? The victor of the Quarter Quell . . . or
you?”</p>
<p>Drusilla’s expression twists into a leer. “I hope you do win. You
have no idea what’s in store for you then. You know nothing.” She limps
to the door.</p>
<p>“I know my grandmother had a jacket like yours, but we wouldn’t let
her wear it out of the house,” says Maysilee.</p>
<p>Drusilla tenses, but tries to make a dignified exit.</p>
<p>There’s a long pause, then Plutarch says, “You may find Drusilla
ridiculous, but be smart. You four don’t have your own district mentor.
Your stylist’s job begins and ends with your appearance. It might not be
fair, but Drusilla may be the best advocate you have in the Capitol.
Think about it before you burn that bridge entirely.” He leaves, quietly
closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>“You okay?” I ask Maysilee.</p>
<p>“Never better.” She gingerly touches the welts, bringing tears to her
eyes.</p>
<p>I can’t help feeling sorry for her and a little impressed by how she
stood up to Drusilla. Even though she’s rich, she’s not trying to cozy
up to the Capitol people. We’re all equally beneath her. “There I was,
trying to be so high-and-mighty about the cake, and then you go all
wildcat on us.”</p>
<p>Maysilee gives a small smile. “Well, I have strong opinions on
fashion.”</p>
<p>“I guess you do,” says Louella.</p>
<p>“It’s high time someone told Miss Matchy-Matchy she looks hideous,”
says Maysilee. “But you look fine, Louella. Your mother did a nice job
trimming your dress.”</p>
<p>The girls eye each other. I can feel a slight thaw, but all Louella
says is “I think so, too.”</p>
<p>A Peacekeeper beckons us from the door and we follow her back through
the train to a compartment with two sets of bunk beds built into the
walls. A door leads to a small bathroom with a toilet and sink.
“Toothbrushes and towels in the bathroom, and you each get your own
bed.”</p>
<p>She waits, as if we’re supposed to be grateful, but the only person
who responds is Maysilee. “It smells like cooked cabbage in here.”</p>
<p>“In the old days, we used to put you in cattle cars,” the Peacekeeper
replies, then locks us in.</p>
<p>On the pillows are pajamas, which we sort out based on our sizes. We
take turns in the bathroom and retreat to our bunks. Shades
automatically slide down over the windows and the bulbs above the door
dim, leaving us in twilight. Wyatt falls asleep almost immediately,
judging by his snores, and Louella follows suit. Maysilee sits on the
top bunk across from me, holding a wet washrag to her welts. I lie on my
back, staring at the ceiling, trying to make sense of the day.</p>
<p>My fingers wrap around the flint striker hanging from my neck. The
picture of Lenore Dove, drenched and wailing in the storm, overtakes me,
and my heart begins to splinter again. I squeeze my eyes shut tight and
reach for her across the miles, knowing she is reaching for me, too. I
hear her voice singing a piece of her poem, her name song.</p>
<p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,
fearing,</p>
<p>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;</p>
<p>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,</p>
<p>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”</p>
<p>I know every word of the song, since I learned it for Lenore Dove’s
birthday last December. It wasn’t that hard, it being what she calls an
earworm, meaning it sticks in your head whether you want it to or not.
It’s true, the thing’s addictive, rhyming and repeating in a way that
dares you to stop, all while telling you a haunting story. I sang it to
her in an old house by the lake in front of a fire. We were toasting
stale marshmallows and we’d skipped school, which we both caught hell
for later. She said it was her favorite gift ever. . . .</p>
<p>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>I try to ignore Maysilee.</p>
<p>Merely this and nothing more.</p>
<p>“The thing around your neck?”</p>
<p>The connection has broken. Lenore Dove’s gone. I look over to find
Maysilee staring at me, her eyes wide in the dark.</p>
<p>“Birthday present. From my girl.”</p>
<p>“Can I see it? I collect jewelry.”</p>
<p>You don’t hear that much in District 12, but Mr. Donner spoils his
girls rotten. Lenore Dove told me that, on their thirteenth birthday, he
gave them pure gold pins that had belonged to his mother. They’d been
fashioned by Tam Amber over thirty years ago. I never saw them, but
Merrilee’s featured a hummingbird and Maysilee’s a mockingjay, birds
being one of the Covey’s great loves. Apparently, Merrilee wore hers all
of five minutes before she lost it down a well. Maysilee threw a fit
over hers, saying a mockingjay was an ugly old thing and why couldn’t
Tam Amber melt it down and make her something pretty like a butterfly?
When he declined, she stuffed the pin in the back of a drawer and never
wore it once.</p>
<p>Lenore Dove saw red when she heard about the twins, feeling they
neither appreciated nor deserved Tam Amber’s craftsmanship, and for a
time, she spoke about breaking into the Donners’ and stealing that
mockingjay pin back. Burdock and I talked her out of it. What with two
recent arrests, it seemed unwise. But it still eats at her. I know she
would not want Maysilee’s manicured paws on my necklace.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of personal,” I say. “I mean, I’m not planning on taking
it off ever again. It’s not really jewelry anyway.”</p>
<p>She nods and doesn’t pursue it. Just hangs her washrag over the
bedrail, gets under her covers, and rolls over to face the wall. I’m
chilly in the refrigerated train air, so I pull up the Capitol blanket,
which is stiff and has a chemical odor. Nothing like my soft patchwork
quilt that Ma dries in the sunshine on Sundays, when the mine’s quiet
and the soot’s minimal so it smells like fresh air. Ma . . . Sid . .
.</p>
<p>I don’t expect to sleep, but the day’s been so draining that the
movement of the train lulls me into a semiconscious state. A few hours
later, I wake with a start and feel someone shaking my leg.</p>
<p>“Hay. Hay!” Louella whispers over Wyatt’s snores.</p>
<p>I prop myself up on my elbow and squint at her through the dim light.
“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want Wyatt. I don’t want him for an ally, okay?”</p>
<p>“Wyatt? Okay, but can I know why? He looks pretty strong and —”</p>
<p>She breaks in. “He’s a Booker Boy. At least, his pa is.”</p>
<p>The Booker Boys are miners who cater to those who like to gamble in
12. They take bets on any number of goings-on — dogfights, mayor
appointments, boxing matches — and organize gambling events. On Saturday
nights, you can usually find them in an old garage behind the Hob,
running dice and card games for a cut. If things get tense with the
Peacekeepers, like the time someone set fire to a jeep, then they lay
low, popping up in back alleys and condemned houses.</p>
<p>Personally, I never gamble. If Ma heard I’d been spending money on
cards, she’d kill me, and beyond that, I just don’t get the thrill of
it. Life in general seems risky enough to me. But if people want to
throw away their money, it’s not my business.</p>
<p>“Well, I make white liquor, so I’m not one to point fingers,” I tell
Louella. “We’re both operating outside the law. And doesn’t Cayson like
his dice?”</p>
<p>Cayson’s her older brother and, when he’s not in the mines, he’s
chasing some kind of pleasure.</p>
<p>Louella gives her head an impatient shake. “Not just dice. I mean
now. I mean us.”</p>
<p>Then I get it. Around this time every year, a couple of Booker Boys
take bets on the Hunger Games tributes. Like how old will the kids be,
Seam or town, the number of tesserae they carry. The betting continues
through the Games, with odds on deaths and districts and the ultimate
victor. It should be illegal, but the Peacekeepers don’t care. It’s
modeled on their own system of betting in the Capitol. Most of the
Booker Boys shun this, it being too blackhearted, but a few make a nice
profit. Those are sick and twisted people, and not the kind you can
trust in the Hunger Games.</p>
<p>“You sure, Louella?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Near as I can be. I didn’t put it together until I saw Wyatt messing
with that coin,” she said. “Cayson told me all the gamblers learn that
stuff, to signal people there’s a game on when they can’t say so out
loud.”</p>
<p>“He seemed to know all about stacking the deck. . . .”</p>
<p>“And one time, someone brought up Mr. Callow, and Cayson spit and
said he didn’t have no truck with people who made money on dead
kids.”</p>
<p>Well, Wyatt being reaped is the final word in irony. I think of the
Callows frantically trying to reach him on the square. Never getting to
say good-bye. Hard to feel much pity for them now. “Do you think he took
bets on our reaping with his pa?”</p>
<p>“That’d be my guess,” she says.</p>
<p>“Mine, too. Booker Boys keep their business in the family. I don’t
want Wyatt either, Louella. It’s just you and me. Try and get some more
sleep, okay?”</p>
<p>I don’t, though. Around dawn, the shades retract and I stare out into
unfamiliar mountains, adding insult to injury. What’s happening in my
mountains? Is Hattie brewing another batch of forgetfulness? Is Ma
scrubbing away her grief on the washboard, while Sid fills the cistern
under a cloudless sky? Are the geese standing guard over Lenore Dove’s
heart? As much pain as my loved ones feel now, how long will it be until
I am just a memory?</p>
<p>Plutarch sticks his head in to announce breakfast in a cheerful voice
that suggests yesterday never happened. We dress and go back to the
sitting room car for egg and bacon sandwiches and more lemonade.
Maysilee asks for coffee, a rich person drink in 12, and Tibby brings us
each a cup. I don’t care for the bitter stuff.</p>
<p>The train climbs and climbs and suddenly we’re in a pitch-black
tunnel and Plutarch says it won’t be long now, but it seems like an
eternity. When we finally pull into the station, the sunlight streaming
through the glass panels dazzles my eyes before I make out another train
across the platform.</p>
<p>I recognize Juvenia, the District 1 escort who Drusilla sneered at,
tentatively descending the train steps in snakeskin boots. Behind her
come her four tributes, cuffed and chained together, towering over their
Peacekeepers. When the car door shuts behind them, the boy bringing up
the rear suddenly turns and kicks the window. The glass shatters like an
eggshell.</p>
<p>A quiet voice behind me says, “Panache Barker, District One tribute,
trained Career, roughly three hundred pounds. His last name suggests
he’s related to Palladium Barker, who took the crown four years ago.
He’ll currently have odds of about five to two, which in the arena would
translate into an average of two meals a day from sponsors. He looks to
be a lefty, which can be a plus or a minus, but he’s also a hothead, and
that could cost him. Based on the reaping stats — training, weight,
lineage — he’s a current crowd favorite, whereas we’re strictly
long-shot material.”</p>
<p>We all stare at Wyatt, who keeps his eyes on the competition as he
muses, “You might not want me, but it’s a sure bet you need me.”</p>
