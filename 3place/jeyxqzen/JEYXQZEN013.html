<h4 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h4>
<p>I don’t remember anyone getting a one before. Ever. In fact, I’m
hard-pressed to remember a two. Even threes are rare and reserved for
extreme long shots like Lou Lou. How will the audience interpret this?
That I’m weak? Friendless? A coward? Any way you slice it, it will not
result in my getting sponsors. I’m going to be entirely on my own in the
arena when it comes to supplies.</p>
<p>“You must have gotten to them,” Maysilee says with satisfaction.
“Between the reaping and Louella and spitting on the crowd. You really
caught their attention.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s a sunny interpretation,” I reply.</p>
<p>“Perhaps she’s right,” says Mags. “If nothing else, it’s distinctive.
People will be gossiping about it. With forty-eight tributes, just
becoming recognizable is a plus.”</p>
<p>Wyatt shakes his head. “I don’t even know how to factor that into
your odds. What’d you do anyway?”</p>
<p>Good question. “I guess . . . not in so many words but . . . I
accused them of murdering us.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” says Lou Lou, her eyes boring through me. Then she winces and
swipes at her ear. We can hear a faint but piercing tone that must be
deafening in her head. When it eases, tears stream from her eyes and
she’s gasping. Wyatt presses his finger against his lips and then hugs
her tightly.</p>
<p>I take the first watch again at bedtime, my mind swimming with
strategy. The Gamemakers, no doubt under Snow’s direction, have made an
example of me, and that displeasure could follow me into the arena. I
may have doomed myself to a gory opening death. My hand seeks my flint
striker for comfort, but finds only bare skin. They couldn’t even leave
me that last token of Lenore Dove’s love. What did she think when they
announced my score tonight? Since she didn’t get to witness all my
reckless behavior here, she probably blames herself for me getting
called out in the reaping. But how will she ever know that was only a
teaspoon of trouble in my river of wrong?</p>
<p>I feel like I’m a big risk now to the plot to disable the arena, but
I’m sure Beetee’s figured that out. I stay awake through three watches,
thinking he might pay me another visit. Eventually, my eyelids get so
heavy I wake Wyatt to take over.</p>
<p>Our mentors let us sleep in late, and I feel better when I find my
precious necklace awaiting me at the kitchen table. All four of our
tokens cleared, and we reach for them with eager hands.</p>
<p>“Can I see yours now? Since it’s already off?” Maysilee asks me.</p>
<p>What can I say? No, because my girlfriend hates you? We’re supposed
to act like allies now, and I figure Lenore Dove will never know, so I
pass over my token.</p>
<p>Maysilee studies it meticulously, going over every bit of engraving
and reading the inscription, which does not escape her notice as it did
mine. “Well, the Covey have an eye for beauty, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>“Heard you have one of Tam Amber’s pins,” I say.</p>
<p>She wrinkles her nose. “Oh, that. It’s well made, but I don’t care
much for mockingjays. Something unnatural about a bird that’s
half-mutt.”</p>
<p>Never thought of it that way. “Some people think that’s a victory in
itself. Way they escaped the Capitol and survived.”</p>
<p>“Do they?” says Maysilee. “Well, if I escape the Capitol and survive,
maybe I’ll give that pin a second chance.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t, I’m sure Lenore Dove would be happy to take it off
your hands,” I say.</p>
<p>“Lenore Dove . . .” Maysilee gives me a knowing smile. “She doesn’t
like me, your girlfriend. And it’s not because of any pin.”</p>
<p>“Because you’re so mean, you think?” I ask innocently.</p>
<p>Maysilee laughs. “Partly, maybe. But mostly because I know her secret
and she hates being at my mercy.”</p>
<p>Her secret? “What’s that mean?”</p>
<p>“It means how come she’s got orange paint on her fingernails when she
shows up to play for the mayor’s birthday party?” She hands me back the
token. “You ask her that if you get home.”</p>
<p>I look down at the necklace in confusion. There’s orange on some of
the feathers. She was probably just helping Tam Amber. Or maybe she
tried painting them to match her lipstick. I guess Maysilee made some
crack about Lenore Dove having ugly nails. But why is that a secret that
would put her at Maysilee’s mercy? Nail polish is pricey — is Maysilee
suggesting Lenore Dove stole it?</p>
<p>“Tell me now,” I say.</p>
<p>“I told you, it’s a secret. Those should be respected.” Maysilee
carefully arranges her necklaces — apparently, the Gamemakers viewed her
collection as a single token — and hooks the purple and yellow flowers
around Lou Lou’s neck. “Unless, of course, you’ve got one to trade? Then
we’d have something to talk about.”</p>
<p>“Some girl thing,” Wyatt comments as he puts on his token. “They
never make sense.”</p>
<p>“You said a mouthful,” I agree. The scrip coin Maysilee wove into
Wyatt’s cord distracts me. She designed it so it’s easy to pop the coin
in and out of the weave because flipping it through his fingers helps
Wyatt think.</p>
<p>“Hey, what’s that coin made of? Nickel?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Zinc, I think,” says Wyatt.</p>
<p>“Potato battery,” I remind him. “Keep an eye out for copper.”</p>
<p>Maysilee fishes the flower medallion from the display at her neck.
“Already on it.”</p>
<p>“Of course you are, Miss Donner,” I say. “If the Gamemakers cleared
those, maybe they’re hoping you’ll use them.”</p>
<p>Just then, Drusilla shows up and calls us into the living room so she
can help with our interview prep. After the reaping and chariot fiascos,
she’s feeling some heat. Our training numbers aren’t doing her any
favors either. This is her last big event for the Quell and she needs it
to go well.</p>
<p>“Listen, you lot, there are always softhearted dolts who will send
supplies to losers like you, if they can find some way to relate to you.
The only one who’s got any name recognition right now is Haymitch,
because people are trying to figure out why his score’s so abysmal. He
also got some attention for his appalling behavior toward the audience
at the parade. But the rest of you are basically nonexistent. This
interview will be your last chance to make some sort of impression
before the Games begin. Anything that makes you stand out is a plus.
Make me remember you. So, who are you? Why should I want to lay my money
on you? What are you selling?”</p>
<p>With an audience of Drusilla, Mags, Wiress, and ourselves we clear a
space and try to simulate our upcoming interviews. Drusilla plays Caesar
Flickerman, the smooth-talking host of the event. She loses patience
with Lou Lou almost immediately, given that the child can’t do much more
than repeat, “My name is Louella McCoy. I’m from District Twelve.”</p>
<p>“That’s absolutely dreadful,” says Drusilla. “Flickerman will eat you
alive. What’s wrong with you anyway? Snap out of it!” She gives Lou Lou
a shake by the shoulders.</p>
<p>The contact triggers something in Lou Lou, who begins to scream,
“You’re murdering us! You’re murdering us!”</p>
<p>Drusilla gasps and raises her hand to slap Lou Lou, but the rest of
us intervene, and Mags takes Lou Lou into the bedroom.</p>
<p>“That isn’t Louella McCoy,” Maysilee tells Drusilla. “She’s dead.
That’s a body double. Some little girl the Capitol has tortured until
she can’t even remember her real name. But even she can see the obvious.
You’re murdering us.”</p>
<p>Drusilla looks around for backup, but the Peacekeepers remained
downstairs and Wiress isn’t giving any. So there’s just her and us
district piglets, including Maysilee, who slaps back. She composes
herself. “That’s not my department. Your interviews are.” She points to
Wyatt. “You’re up.”</p>
<p>After they exchange niceties, she asks Wyatt what makes him
special.</p>
<p>“I’m an oddsmaker,” he says without hesitation.</p>
<p>“An oddsmaker? What’s that?”</p>
<p>“I set the odds for gambling events back in Twelve. I give odds on
who will win the Hunger Games.”</p>
<p>“You do?” asks Drusilla skeptically.</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“So, who do you recommend our audience bet on?”</p>
<p>Wyatt takes a deep breath and rattles off his projections. “Well,
it’s tempting to go for the low-hanging fruit. The odds will always look
good for most of the Careers. Like Panache from District One, the
largest tribute, trained, high score, I’d give him eleven-to-five odds,
which means he has a thirty-one-point-two-five percent chance of
winning. Or Maritte from Four, she’s obviously a contender, with her
physique and an eleven from the Game-makers, probably an indication that
she’s exceptional with a trident. I’d say six to one, or a
fourteen-point-two-nine percent.”</p>
<p>“Hmph. Fancy math, but nothing new there,” says Drusilla. “Everybody
knows the Careers are a good bet.”</p>
<p>“Obviously,” returns Wyatt. “But what’s made these Games a novelty is
that all forty-eight tributes have locked into alliances before the
start. Nothing like this has ever happened before. The Careers are
powerful, yes, but the Newcomers outnumber them two to one. If I was
betting, sure, I’d take a look at the Careers, but if the alliances
really hold, if the tributes really defend each other to the death,
anyone has a shot. And if you’re not afraid of some risk, it’s better
bang for your buck if you back a more obscure Newcomer because the odds
are not in their favor, so they’ll pay off higher in the end.”</p>
<p>“Give me a name,” says Drusilla.</p>
<p>“Haymitch Abernathy,” says Wyatt.</p>
<p>“He scored a one.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. With no apparent handicaps. He’s physically fit and his
behavior suggests a boldness that disturbs the Gamemakers.”</p>
<p>Thrown, I interject, “You don’t have to do that, Wyatt.”</p>
<p>“I’m not doing anything, Haymitch. This is my honest assessment of
your chances. Maysilee’s not a bad bet either.”</p>
<p>“What about yourself?” asks Drusilla.</p>
<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t bet on me,” admits Wyatt. “I simply —”</p>
<p>“No!” cuts in Wiress. “Don’t underrate yourself, Wyatt. No other
tribute can do what you just did. Play up how intelligence matters.
Reference me. Say Wiress won the Games last year without shedding a drop
of blood. Brains matter.”</p>
<p>Wyatt thinks this over a moment, then turns to Drusilla. “Here’s the
thing. At any given moment in the Hunger Games, I will know everybody’s
odds, how they stack up against each other, and how likely they are to
receive gifts. It should keep me from making a lot of stupid mistakes.
That’s my advantage. It’s up to you if you’re smart enough to see
it.”</p>
<p>“Good,” says Wiress. “Yes. Position yourself as the smart choice for
bettors. People who pride themselves on being smart will respond to
that.”</p>
<p>When it’s Maysilee’s turn, she and Drusilla stare daggers at each
other, but refrain from exchanging blows.</p>
<p>“So, Miss Donner, what do you think of the Capitol?”</p>
<p>“I think I can’t believe people with so much money have such bad
taste. Here you are with mountains of cash, and this is where you wound
up?” She gives Drusilla’s outfit — a red-and-white-striped jumpsuit with
a matching beanie — the once-over. “You look like you jumped right off
our candy counter back home. Just a peppermint-stick nightmare, you
are.”</p>
<p>Drusilla’s hand goes to her collar. “You’re not going to make any
friends with this approach, you little shrew.”</p>
<p>“Who said I wanted friends? I’m here to make people remember me,
’member? It’s not just you, it’s everyone I saw from the chariot. Garish
color, unflattering lines. And there are some fashion choices you people
are going to regret. Why you’d want to resemble a barnyard animal is
beyond me, but I hope those goat horns are removable. And to the woman
with the diamonds implanted along her teeth? People age, there’s no
shame in that, but I think those stones are going to make eating a trial
when those gums recede.”</p>
<p>“So, we should be emulating what — District Twelve?” sputters
Drusilla.</p>
<p>“Heavens, no. People who don’t have two cents to rub together can
hardly be expected to dress well. Although there’s not a miner in Twelve
who doesn’t have a better physique than the people I witnessed in that
crowd. All the surgery in the world won’t change that.”</p>
<p>“What —?”</p>
<p>“And all the money in the world won’t buy good taste. Clearly. Some
people in Twelve have a lot more than what I’m witnessing here.”</p>
<p>“Are you done?” Drusilla says.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I have barely warmed up.”</p>
<p>“Sit down.”</p>
<p>It’s Wiress who concludes, “It’s a risky strategy, but yes, they’ll
remember you.”</p>
<p>Mags comes back, holding a handkerchief dotted in blood. “She’s
drifted off. I don’t know what they’ve got in her ear, but it’s starting
to bleed.”</p>
<p>Drusilla waves her off. “Again, not my department. You’re up,
Abernanny. So, Twelve has a lunatic, a computer, and a shrew.What are
you?”</p>
<p>“Bad news, apparently,” I say. “Else how’d I get a one in
training?”</p>
<p>Mags coaches me. “Yes, that’s good, highlight it immediately. Own
it.”</p>
<p>“Well, how did you?” asks Drusilla.</p>
<p>“Earned it. The Gamemakers don’t like me. It probably started when I
messed with a Peacekeeper during the reaping.”</p>
<p>“You can’t say that!” Drusilla protests. “You’ll spoil the brilliant
work I did covering up the riot!”</p>
<p>“What riot? Woodbine ran and your people shot him.”</p>
<p>“I know a riot when I see it! Never mind. That’s forbidden. It won’t
win you any points with the audience anyway. They’ll respond to a bad
boy, not a rebel. You need to be naughty, not dangerous. For instance,
last winter, one of the University students dyed all the fountains pink
when there was a face cream shortage. So saucy! Everyone loved it!”</p>
<p>I sense she’s actually trying to help, but . . . “Yeah, okay. But I’m
going into the Hunger Games. I don’t think a face cream statement is
going to cut it. Can I talk about spitting on the crowd?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not! What will people do with that?”</p>
<p>“Well, if I can’t do the reaping, and I can’t do the spitting, what
am I supposed to talk about?”</p>
<p>Drusilla thinks a moment. “You must be mysterious. Allude to radical
behavior without being specific. The ones who witnessed the opening
ceremony have already been gossiping. Let the audience use its
imagination.”</p>
<p>“Naughty, not dangerous,” I repeat.</p>
<p>“That’s it. Be a rascal. A charming, naughty rascal.”</p>
<p>A rascal. That’s what Mamaw used to call a squirrel who’d sneak up on
the porch to steal nuts she was shelling. Right from under her nose.
Bold as a stump, but funny, too. “Well, I can try.”</p>
<p>I don’t get a chance, though, because right then, Proserpina and
Vitus burst into the apartment in a state of agitation.</p>
<p>“It’s Magno. We went to his apartment to see the interview costumes
so we can plan tonight’s makeup and hair —” begins Proserpina.</p>
<p>“We’re allowed to do that. Required to, actually, on our syllabus. So
it’s not like we’re brownnosing or anything —” interjects Vitus.</p>
<p>“And the door to his apartment was wide open and he’s reeling around,
he’s sick —”</p>
<p>“He’s puking all over the place and talking like a crazy person and
—”</p>
<p>“We think the toad venom rumors might be true!” Proserpina claps her
hands over her mouth as if she’s let some monster cat out of the
bag.</p>
<p>“Rumors?” rants Drusilla. “That man’s been licking toads since the
war. I can’t believe that even he would risk it during the Games. Oh,
what am I saying? Of course I can. If for no other reason than to end my
career!”</p>
<p>“Why would he lick toads?” asks Wyatt.</p>
<p>“Because he’s a reptilian freak! And he’ll do anything to take me
down.”</p>
<p>“They say some kinds make you hallucinate or something. If they don’t
kill you,” explains Vitus. “Some people do it for fun, but ugh,
nasty.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to issue a formal complaint with the Gamemakers!” Drusilla
grabs her handbag and storms out, effectively ending my interview
practice.</p>
<p>“Do you two, perhaps, have any black clothing they could wear?”
Wiress asks our prep team.</p>
<p>“Us?” asks Vitus in disbelief. “We don’t wear black!”</p>
<p>“It’s too depressing!” Proserpina bursts into tears, her magenta hair
puffs bobbing wildly. “I need to call my sister.” She throws herself
into a chair next to a table holding a burnt orange telephone, presses
some buttons, and begins to wail into the receiver, “I’m going to fail!
I’m going to fail!”</p>
<p>Mags corrals the rest of us, including Vitus, into the kitchen to eat
bowls of strawberry ice cream.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, Proserpina joins us. “My sister says it isn’t
our fault and to just do the best prep we can.” She slurps a big
spoonful of ice cream, a last trickle of tears sliding down her flushed
cheeks. “She says if they try to fail us, we can appeal to the
University Board. My sister knows everybody on the University Board on
account of how she used to be the student social planner and had to get
everything approved.”</p>
<p>“Her sister’s amazing,” says Vitus.</p>
<p>“She is,” says Proserpina. “She was the president of the Capitol
Cohorts Chapters. And she basically created the Spring Saturnalia her
freshman year.”</p>
<p>“It’s the best party of the year,” Vitus tells us. “So much better
than that tired old fling.”</p>
<p>“So much better,” echoes Proserpina. “Anyway, she thinks we’re going
to be all right. Like she says, a positive attitude is ninety-seven
percent of the battle.”</p>
<p>It’s so astonishingly self-absorbed, in the face of our impending
deaths, that I don’t even know how to respond.</p>
<p>Maysilee, on the other hand, doesn’t miss a beat. “I’ll try to keep
that in mind in the arena. More ice cream?”</p>
<p>Mags catches my eye, her smile barely suppressed.</p>
<p>Proserpina just holds out her bowl, oblivious. “I really think it
will help you.”</p>
<p>Maysilee, Lou Lou, and Wyatt’s prep teams arrive, and we take turns
in the bathrooms and bedrooms being groomed. I try to negotiate a few
extra minutes floating in the tub so I can work out how I might come
across as a rascal, but all I can think about is stealing nuts. I have a
bad feeling I’m just going to come off as annoying.</p>
<p>Since they’re not trying to counteract the insecticides from the gym
shower, the prep teams get better results with less effort, but they
can’t compensate for our clothes. We were given a few changes of socks
and underwear, but aside from that, we’ve been wearing our training
outfits for three days straight. Lou Lou’s is as wrinkled as a raisin
from her napping in it, Wyatt spilled mashed potatoes on his and
scraping it off made it look worse, and I have a tear at my shoulder
from when Panache attacked me. Even Maysilee, who looks the least
crumpled, has a spattering of her homemade glue from working with
tokens. On top of that, the cheap fabric really holds the smell of fear
sweat that we’ve been pumping out, and that’s demoralizing even if the
cameras won’t pick it up.</p>
<p>I try to keep a positive attitude, since that’s ninety-seven percent
of the battle, reminding myself that at least we have black clothing
that fits us and we have our tokens. But the truth can’t be denied. We
look like what we are: neglected, no-account,
not-worth-a-professional-stylist long shots from District 12. Who’s
going to sponsor that?</p>
<p>On top of this, we have eight prep team members, half of them in
tears, totally preoccupied with how this will affect their grades and,
consequently, their future job prospects. Drusilla returns, pissed
because she was unable to file a complaint until after the Games. As an
afterthought, she went to see if she could rouse Magno, but he didn’t
answer his door and she thinks he might be dead, which is the only thing
that’s keeping her going. Except maybe that quart bottle of rum she’s
knocking back in the kitchen. Wiress and Mags try to focus our minds on
our interviews, but the general commotion makes that impossible.</p>
<p>The noise drowns out the ping of the arriving elevator, so she seems
to appear out of thin air. A young woman with lavender hair, a dress
like a grape gumball, and green checked stockings. Four black hats
stacked on her head, clothes bags draped over her arms, she wheels a
cart of spiky shoes into the center of the living room and announces,
“Who’s ready for a big, big, big day!”</p>
