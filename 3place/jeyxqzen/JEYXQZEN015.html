<h4 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h4>
<p>I grip the phone, eyes shut tight. I am back in the mountains. Arms
wrapped around her, the scent of honeysuckle in her hair. She’d been
crying then, too. Not at anything I did, but because they’d hung a man
that morning and made the rest of us watch. But there we were, high in
the hills, with not one but two rainbows arching across the sky.
Sometimes she cries because things are so beautiful and we keep messing
them up. Because the world doesn’t have to be so terrifying. That’s on
people, not the world.</p>
<p>“Haymitch?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s me. I’m here. Where are you calling from?”</p>
<p>“I’m on the Peacekeepers’ base. They arrested me.”</p>
<p>This jolts me back to the conservatory. It’s not honeysuckle I’m
smelling, but the faint mix of roses and decaying meat drifting off the
nepenthes. My arms can’t protect her, only embrace the empty air.
“Arrested you? When? What for?” Is this because I just joked about the
Peacekeepers buying white liquor? Are they taking out my waywardness on
her?</p>
<p>“Last night. For playing music. I guess I went a little crazy when
they gave you that one in training. I took my tune box over to the
Justice Building. They hadn’t pulled the stage down yet, and I did a few
songs.”</p>
<p>She doesn’t have to tell me which songs. “The Goose and the Common.”
“The Capitol Store.” “The Hanging Tree.” All the ones she’s forbidden to
play in public. Clerk Carmine and Tam Amber must be going nuts right
now. And I share their exasperation and fear. “Oh, Lenore Dove . . . are
you all right? Did they hurt you?”</p>
<p>“No. Just hauled me in. Less about what I played, more about how it
drew people. Everybody’s real upset this year, so many kids. They needed
a place to be together, to raise their voices. Sometimes the hurt’s too
bad to bear alone.”</p>
<p>So it wasn’t just her, playing her heart out in front of the Justice
Building. A crowd had gathered. Sung the forbidden songs. “Did they say
the charges?”</p>
<p>“Disrupting the peace or something. And you know, ‘No Peace, No
Anything.’”</p>
<p>My mind races. Disrupting the peace isn’t sedition. They can lay that
on you for getting drunk and busting up a few bottles, which happens all
the time in 12. It’s not like she’s part of some big conspiracy, so,
hopefully, they won’t use methods to force her to talk. Just view her as
an emotional sixteen-year-old whose boyfriend got reaped. Maybe take
away her tune box for a while or keep her locked up until after the
Hunger Games when things have died down. I hope they don’t put her in
the stocks on the square, which is what they threatened to do when she
was twelve. But that was four years ago, and the Covey have some
Peacekeepers among their fans, so that could work in her favor. A lot
will depend on how rowdy the audience got and how the base commander
views it. I sure didn’t do her any favors by bragging about selling him
white liquor tonight. Now he may feel obliged to come down harder on
her.</p>
<p>“Was there fighting? Did anything get broke?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Oh, who cares? They’re letting me out tomorrow morning, but you’re
going into the arena.” Relief surges through me. They’re letting her
out. Just a slap on the wrist. “None of my stuff matters a whit,” she
continues. “And I sure don’t want to spend our last moments talking
about what’s broken. Except my heart . . . how about that?”</p>
<p>She’s mad and probably near tears again. “Oh, Lenore Dove . . . I’m
so sorry I messed everything up.” And I did, too. The Peacekeepers
wouldn’t have targeted her just for trying to help Woodbine’s ma. At
least, not as a rule.</p>
<p>“You? It’s entirely my fault you’re there! And I know I’m why you got
that score. I as good as killed you, and that’s not something I can live
with.”</p>
<p>And so she’s doing what she can to get herself killed? Now I’m mad.
“That’s just a lie you’ve got to stop telling yourself! If I’d kept my
head, you might’ve gotten a few bruises, but we’d both still be in
Twelve.”</p>
<p>“No, darling, that’s not how it went down at all. I overstepped, just
like my uncles always warn me about. I lost my temper and started
hollering and now you’re — oh, Haymitch . . . I don’t want to be on this
earth without you.”</p>
<p>“So now you’re trying to get them to hang you? You do, and I swear
I’ll — I’ll —” I’ll what? I’ll be dead and gone is what, in no position
to do anything. But I feel so helpless now, I’ve got to try whatever I
can to change her mind. I have no idea what happens when we die, but
Lenore Dove believes nothing ever dies, and we just move from one world
to the next like the Covey did from town to town. “Like in one of your
songs, my ghost will hunt down your ghost and never give it a moment’s
rest.”</p>
<p>“Promise?” She sounds a little more hopeful. “Because if I could
count on that, I think I could bear it. But what I can’t bear is . . .
what if we’re never together again?”</p>
<p>“We will be together always,” I say with conviction. “I don’t know
how, and I don’t know where, I don’t know anything, but I feel that in
my heart. You and me, we will find each other, as many times as it
takes.”</p>
<p>“You think?”</p>
<p>“I do. But not if you do something stupid like getting yourself
killed on purpose. I feel like that could throw the whole thing out of
whack. You stay alive, play your songs, love your people, live the best
life you can. And I’ll be there in the Meadow waiting for you. It’s a
promise. Okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay,” she whispers. “I’ll try. That’s my promise back.”</p>
<p>Plutarch waves his hand to get my attention, taps his watch. Time has
run out.</p>
<p>“Lenore Dove, I love you like all-fire. That’s for always.”</p>
<p>“I love you like all-fire, too. You and no one else. Just like my
geese, I mate for life. And then some. Forever.”</p>
<p>I need to say, no, don’t spend your life grieving me, love whoever
you want. Only I just can’t bear the thought of it at the moment. Her
kissing someone else. But I’m trying to be noble, to pull myself up to
say those words, when the line goes dead without warning.</p>
<p>“Lenore Dove? Lenore Dove?”</p>
<p>She’s gone. Truly for good, this time. But she is safe. I set the
swan head back in the cradle like I am laying down a sleeping child,
slow and gentle-like. Good-bye, my love.</p>
<p>Only now do I wonder how this call has occurred. I’ve never even
heard of a tribute getting to talk to someone back home from the
Capitol. I meet Plutarch’s eyes. “You set that call up?”</p>
<p>He shrugs. “I have an old friend in Twelve.”</p>
<p>“Why would you do that for me?” I say, genuinely perplexed. “I bet it
could get you in real trouble.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you’re right. If it gets discovered, my next meal will probably
be a large platter of poisoned oysters. But I risked it because I need
you to trust me, Haymitch. More importantly, I need you to trust the
information I’m about to give you.”</p>
<p>I’m completely lost. “What information?”</p>
<p>“About how to break the arena.”</p>
<p>This pulls me up short. Plutarch? Plutarch knows about the arena
plot? He’s right. I don’t trust him, or the whole forsaken plan now.
Were Beetee and I being recorded somehow during the blackout, even if
the cameras were out? It would be easy enough to bug the place. Were
there microphones in the vegetable bouquet tonight? If that’s the case,
Plutarch could be working for the Capitol, trying to get more info out
of me and kill anyone involved. He set up the call with Lenore Dove so I
would trust him, so I would confide in him.</p>
<p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” I say.</p>
<p>“Fine. That’s smart. Don’t trust me. Only hear what I have to say
and, when you’re in the arena, see if it comes in handy.”</p>
<p>I lift my hands in bewilderment. “You sure you got the right
guy?”</p>
<p>“Okay, just listen. I don’t have any real security clearance, but my
cousin knows a Gamemakers’ apprentice, barely out of the University, who
wants to quit the program and work in television. I spent a fortune the
other night getting him drunk. The most useful piece of info I got was
that the arena’s sun is in sync with our own.”</p>
<p>I look at him, baffled. “Isn’t it always?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes. Depends on the arena. You could have multiple suns or
none at all. The reason this will be of importance to you is that since
the sun rises in the east, you will be able to tell direction.”</p>
<p>Beetee said the tank was in the north. If it’s true, this is
essential information, but I act blasé. “Guess I would’ve assumed that
anyway.”</p>
<p>“Another thing: About a year or two ago, a committee of Gamemakers
asked to tour our conservatory and gardens. The Heavensbees are known
for their collection of rare flowering plants. I gave them the tour and
then stepped out of the room to order tea. I overheard them discussing
opening the berms.”</p>
<p>“Berms?”</p>
<p>“It’s what our gardener calls those mounds of earth.” He points out
through the window where hanging globes illuminate a little knoll
covered in flowers. “She plants shrubs and flowers on them. And if the
Gamemakers are planning to open them in the arena, then something’s
either going in, coming out, or both.”</p>
<p>Mutts. He’s trying to tell me the mutt portals are going to be
concealed by berms of flowers. But I just say, “You have completely lost
me, sir.”</p>
<p>“Of course I have. One last thing. From the Capitol’sperspective, the
Games are the best propaganda we have. You tributes, you’re our stars.
You carry it out. But only if we control the narrative. Don’t let us.”
Plutarch grasps my shoulders and gives me a little shake. “No more
implicit submission for you, Haymitch Abernathy. Blow that water tank
sky high. The entire country needs you to.”</p>
<p>I can’t help but think of Pa’s directive to Sarshee Whitcomb. Seems
like a lot to lay on my doorstep. Fix this mess for us, or else.</p>
<p>Effie hurries in the door. “Mr. Heavensbee? Oh, there you are.
Drusilla wants you to help with Louella’s photos. The snake’s stealing
focus.”</p>
<p>Plutarch chuckles. “Never work with children or animals, Miss
Trinket. Come along, Haymitch.”</p>
<p>“And maybe it isn’t my place to say,” continues Effie, “but she’s
being awfully hard on Maysilee.”</p>
<p>“Well, Maysilee’s sixteen years old with great cheekbones — two
things Drusilla can never achieve.”</p>
<p>“I know, it’s sad. But I give her points for trying.” Effie’s hands
go to her face. “I guess it’s time for me to start trying myself.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I think you’ve got a few years.”</p>
<p>“All my friends have begun maintenance. It’s just, I hate
needles.”</p>
<p>While Plutarch reassures Effie, I follow them back to the library,
trying to make sense of his position. If he’s working for the Capitol, I
don’t think I’ve given him anything to use against us or copped to any
involvement. But if he’s not Snow’s lackey, and he knows about the plot,
and he’s trying to help us . . . what is he after?</p>
<p>His words from a few minutes ago echo back. “You should know that,
despite appearances, a desire for freedom is not limited to the
districts.” Was he suggesting that he, with all his wealth and privilege
and power, lacks freedom? Freedom to do what? Maybe to not have to live
in terror of Snow poisoning his oysters, for one thing.</p>
<p>I think about Vitus’s shame over his rebel-sympathizing grandfather.
That seems to be the norm here, but who was his grandfather? A Capitol
citizen who sided with the districts. And somebody here must have helped
Beetee switch out the tokens. It’s possible that Plutarch could be on
the level. I won’t really know until I’m in the arena and get a good
look at those berms, if they even exist.</p>
<p>Back in the library, Lou Lou’s blowing out the candles and greedily
inhaling the smoke curling off the burned wicks. The smell takes me home
for a moment, dark winter nights, your last impression as you snuggle
safe beneath the quilts. Does smoke conjure up the same memory for Lou
Lou? Like the roll with the seeds did? Something deep and long ago, a
home in District 11 where she was cherished and cared for? Wyatt talks
her into sitting for the camera and then I pose for a couple of shots.
They show us the results, and the photos are miles better than the ones
of us in the coal miner costumes, chained up in the back of the van.
Again, like the reaping presentation, we have Plutarch to thank for
that.</p>
<p>He decides he can just direct us all at once for the propos that will
air throughout the Games, so he doesn’t have to repeat himself. “Let me
catch you up on what Haymitch and I have been discussing.”</p>
<p>Yes, I think. Better catch me up.</p>
<p>“Let’s start with the basics. Public opinion is driven by emotion.
People have an emotional response to something, then they come up with
an argument for why it logically makes sense,” says Plutarch.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s smart,” says Wyatt, looking uneasy. I’m sure
his calculator brain’s appalled by the idea.</p>
<p>“Oh, I didn’t say it was smart — I just said it was true. Make the
audience feel for you, they’ll figure out intellectually why you’re the
right tribute to support,” Plutarch explains.</p>
<p>“But they hate all of us,” Wyatt counters. “They’re watching us kill
each other for entertainment.”</p>
<p>Plutarch waves this away. “They don’t see it that way. Supporting the
Hunger Games is their patriotic duty.”</p>
<p>“Whatever. We’re all their enemies,” says Maysilee.</p>
<p>“Sure, but they have to root for someone. Why not you? You Newcomers
have done a terrific job setting yourselves up as worthy adversaries to
the Careers tonight. In fact, I think the Capitol audience finds you
much more engaging, oddly enough, because you’re not trying to appear to
be like them.”</p>
<p>“You mean, because we don’t seem like Capitol suck-ups,” concludes
Maysilee.</p>
<p>“Exactly. There’s been a lot of concern in the Capitol lately that
district citizens are aspiring to break in here. It’s not entirely
unfounded, particularly with people from One and Two who work closely
with us. Luxury and military, you know. There are Capitol-born folks
assigned out there who’ve got mixed families they want to bring here
now. But you’re unapologetically district. And any way you can drive
home that the Careers are buying into the Games and trying to be more
Capitol than the Capitol itself will increase the social disapproval for
them.”</p>
<p>Once in a blue moon a Seam girl falls for a Peacekeeper and ends up
with a baby, resulting in plenty of social disapproval in 12 as well.
But there’s never any talk of the kid going to the Capitol. Most are
simply disowned by the father, who’s then shipped off to another
district.</p>
<p>“Calling them the Careers still makes them sound like they’re better
than us,” says Maysilee. “We need to give them a stupid nickname.”</p>
<p>“Name-calling! Excellent!” exclaims Plutarch. “Cheap but
effective.”</p>
<p>Itchy Itchy Haymitchy. Yep. Cheap but effective.</p>
<p>“But the nickname should call them stupid without being stupid
itself,” Plutarch goes on. “We need some wordplay. Something clever or
rhyming or catchy. But not crude — this is a family show.”</p>
<p>We toss around words. Suck-ups. Bootlickers. Turncoats. Pretenders.
Backstabbers. Wannabes. Nothing quite works.</p>
<p>“We need an image that comes from real life,” says Maysilee. “That’s
why Neddie Newcomer stuck with us. We need something that’s a poor copy
of something else. Like that artificial sweetener we have to use in our
candy when real sugar’s too dear. But worse.”</p>
<p>“Powdered milk,” says Wyatt.</p>
<p>“Fake leather,” chimes in Effie.</p>
<p>I think of the beer they sell in the Capitol store, thin, sour, and
feeble. The joke is a barrel of it wouldn’t get your mamaw tipsy. “Near
Beer,” I pitch.</p>
<p>Everybody laughs. The name itself is the joke.</p>
<p>“Hey, Near Beer Career!” says Wyatt. “It even rhymes.”</p>
<p>“I think we might be onto something,” says Plutarch. “Haymitch, why
don’t you kick it off? You’ve already got the bootlegger angle going.
People loved it. It was one of the most memorable bits of the
evening.”</p>
<p>We work up a little piece where Plutarch asks me about our opponents
and I answer, “Well, back in Twelve, where we know our libations” — I
brush off pretend dust from my cocktail glass vest and continue — “we
just call them Near Beer Careers. You know, because they’re all foam and
no beer.”</p>
<p>We play with it and change “no beer” to “no kicker” so as not to
repeat the first “beer.” Then we make up some similar sayings for
variation. Maysilee does “All brag and no britches,” since she’s about
fashion, and Wyatt comes up with a gambler’s “All bluff and no aces.”
Lou Lou’s really not in a position to write her own, being curled up
with the snake now, so we decide on the old standby “All bark and no
bite.” Wyatt gets her to say it, just once, for the camera. The snake
shows its teeth on “bite,” so it’s really all we need.</p>
<p>Plutarch seems genuinely happy, saying he’s going to be able to edit
the clips together into some fine propos. He sighs when he mentions the
tools that were abolished and incapacitated in the past, ones deemed
fated to destroy humanity because of their ability to replicate any
scenario using any person. “And in mere seconds!” He snaps his fingers
to emphasize their speed. “I guess it was the right thing to do, given
our natures. We almost wiped ourselves out even without them, so you can
imagine. But oh, the possibilities!”</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s amazing we’re here at all. Given our natures.</p>
<p>Lou Lou’s snake comes up missing, and we’re about to hunt it down
when Plutarch notices the clock on the mantel and waves us toward the
door. “Never mind, never mind. We’ve got to get you to bed. Tomorrow’s
the show.” As he escorts us past the Heavensbees, he starts talking
about getting everybody to jump on the bandwagon again, which he says is
about people being eager to join a popular thing, but it makes me think
about the Covey riding around on their wagon, which was an actual
bandwagon. When we reach the waiting van, Plutarch wishes us all
well.</p>
<p>I still don’t know what to make of the man, but maybe he really did
risk his life to give me a last, few priceless moments with Lenore Dove
and maybe, in the arena, his information will prove true. Who knows if
he might be able to aid us in some other way once the “show” begins? Yet
again, it’s better to stay on his good side.</p>
<p>I offer him my hand. “Thanks for all your help, Plutarch.”</p>
<p>Gratified, he takes it. “Well, I’m despicable on many levels, but in
this I’m on your side.”</p>
<p>I guess we’ll see.</p>
<p>Back at the apartment, Mags and Wiress have a big dinner awaiting us
— pot roast with all the fixings — but there’s not much room in my
stomach due to the butterflies. They compliment us on our performances
and the wonderful work we’ve done with the Newcomers, although I feel
like most of that credit goes to people other than me. At least I didn’t
mess things up.</p>
<p>I’m feeling okay until bedtime, when Maysilee says to me, “Is it
true? That you’re going off on your own?”</p>
<p>Wellie apparently got the word out. “I got a one, Maysilee. They’re
gunning for me. You and Wyatt have a much better chance without me.” I
don’t mention Lou Lou because I don’t think she stands a chance at
all.</p>
<p>Wyatt nods, factoring odds, no doubt. “My head says you’re right but
. . .”</p>
<p>“Trust your head. I’m a bad bet for you.” I wonder, if I wasn’t part
of the flooding plot, would I be so selfless? Or would I cling to the
safety of the group? It doesn’t make me happy to break from them. “Look,
who knows what will happen in there? We may end up crossing paths. But I
can’t make you pay for choices I’ve made.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” says Maysilee. “So we’re back to where we were on the train.
You don’t want us for your allies.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want anybody,” I clarify.</p>
<p>It’s lonely going rogue. I wish I could tell them everything. About
the plot. About speaking to Lenore Dove. About Snow’s warning and
Plutarch’s rising sun. But all that would do is invite questions and
ultimately cause trouble, so that’s where I leave it. I don’t want
anybody. Lights off.</p>
<p>Lou Lou’s immediately dead to the world and the rest of us toss and
turn a lot. I keep dreaming about Lenore Dove, then snapping awake. Her
name song’s hitting way too close to home. In it, a guy loses the love
of his life, Lenore, and he’s going crazy for missing her. Then this big
old raven shows up at his house and won’t leave and whenever he asks the
bird anything, it just says “Nevermore” — which, as you can imagine,
just makes him crazier.</p>
<p>“Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,</p>
<p>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore —</p>
<p>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”</p>
<p>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>Angels, Lenore Dove told me, are humans with wings, who live in a
place called heaven. Some people believe, she said, it’s a possible
destination after death. A good world for good people to go to. But
Lenore Dove is the winged being on my mind at the moment. If there is
anything after the life I’m about to lose, will I be with her again?
Like the guy in her song, I’d sure like to know. But the Raven isn’t
giving the answer either of us wants to hear.</p>
