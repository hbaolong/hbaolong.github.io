<h4 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h4>
<p>For the first time in several nights, Theo slept well. He awoke late
on Saturday morning, and by the time he and Judge staggered downstairs
he was aware that a family meeting of some variety was under way in the
kitchen. His father was at the stove scrambling eggs. His mother, still
in her night robe, sat at one end of the table pecking at a keyboard and
studying the monitor. And Ike, who, to Theo’s knowledge, had not been
present in the house during the thirteen years Theo had been on the
Earth, sat at the other end with the morning newspaper spread out before
him. He was studying the classified ads and making notes. He was wearing
a faded orange jogging suit and an old Yankees cap. The air was thick
with the smell of breakfast and of conversations interrupted and
unfinished. Judge went straight to the stove and began his usual routine
of begging for food.</p>
<p>Various versions of Good Morning were exchanged. Theo walked to the
stove and looked at the food. “All eggs are scrambled,“ his father said.
His father cooked even less than his mother and the eggs looked a bit
raw, at least in Theo’s opinion. He poured himself some grapefruit juice
and took a seat at the table.</p>
<p>No one spoke until Ike said, “Here’s a two-bedroom garage apartment
on Millmont. Six hundred a month. That’s not a bad part of town.“</p>
<p>“Millmont’s okay,“ Mr. Boone said.</p>
<p>“She makes seven dollars an hour and works thirty hours a week,“
Mrs. Boone said, without looking up. “After taxes and a few necessities,
she’ll be lucky to have three hundred dollars a month for rent. She
can’t afford it. That’s why they’re living in the shelter.“</p>
<p>“So where do you think we’ll find an apartment for three hundred
bucks a month?“ Ike asked with a slight edge to his voice. He did not
look up, though. In fact, at the moment no one was making eye contact
with anyone else.</p>
<p>Theo just listened and watched.</p>
<p>Mr. Boone said, “If it’s a garage apartment, then it’s probably a
single owner. I doubt if they’ll rent to El Salvadorans or anyone else
who’s not from here.“ He thumped some eggs on a plate, added a toasted
wheat muffin, and slid it in front of Theo, who quietly said, “Thanks.“
Judge finally got some eggs in his bowl.</p>
<p>Theo took a bite, chewed slowly, listened to the silence. Their
disinterest in his involvement in whatever they were discussing
irritated him. The eggs were too mushy.</p>
<p>He finally said, “Apartment hunting, are we?“</p>
<p>Ike managed to grunt, “Uh-huh.“</p>
<p>El Salvadorans. Living at the shelter. The clues were adding up.</p>
<p>“Woods,“ Mrs. Boone said, still pecking. “Nick Wetzel advertises for
immigration work. Is he a reputable lawyer? I’ve never met him.“</p>
<p>“He advertises a lot,“ Mr. Boone replied. “He used to be on
television begging for car wrecks. I’d stay away.“</p>
<p>“Well, only two lawyers in town mention immigration work in their
ads,“ she said.</p>
<p>“Talk to both of them,“ Ike said.</p>
<p>“I suppose so,“ she said.</p>
<p>“What are we doing here?“ Theo finally asked.</p>
<p>“We have a busy day, Theo,“ his father said as he sat down with a cup
of coffee. “You and I have a very important golf game.“</p>
<p>Theo couldn’t suppress a smile. They played almost every Saturday,
but for the past several days Theo had forgotten about his game. He,
along with the rest of the town, had assumed that the trial would
continue into Saturday and he certainly planned to be in the
courtroom.</p>
<p>“Great. When?“</p>
<p>“We should leave in about thirty minutes.“</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later they were putting their clubs into the back of
Mr. Boone’s SUV and talking about how beautiful the weather was. It was
mid-April, no clouds, temperature expected to reach seventy degrees, the
azaleas were blooming, and the neighbors were toiling away in their
flower beds.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, Theo said, “Dad, where are we going?“ It was
obvious they were not headed to the Strattenburg Municipal Course, the
only place they’d ever played.</p>
<p>“We’re checking out a new course today.“</p>
<p>“Which one?“ Theo knew of only three in the area.</p>
<p>“Waverly Creek.“</p>
<p>Theo allowed this to sink in, then said, “Awesome, Dad. The scene of
the crime.“</p>
<p>“Something like that. I have a client who lives out there and he
invited us to play. He won’t be around, though. Just the two of us.
We’ll play the Creek Course, so maybe there won’t be a crowd.“</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, they pulled into the rather grand entrance of
Waverly Creek. A massive stone wall lined the road and disappeared
around a bend. Heavy gates stopped all traffic. A man in a uniform
stepped out of the guardhouse and approached them as Mr. Boone came to a
stop and lowered his window.</p>
<p>“Good morning,“ the guard said, with a smile and a clipboard.</p>
<p>“Good morning. Name’s Woods Boone. Here to play a little golf. Tee
time at ten forty. Guests of Max Kilpatrick.“</p>
<p>The guard studied his notes, then said, “Welcome, Mr. Boone. Put this
on your dash.“ He handed over a bright yellow card and said, “Hit ’em
straight.“</p>
<p>“Thanks,“ Mr. Boone said, and the gates began to open.</p>
<p>Theo had been through them once before, a couple of years earlier,
for the birthday party of a friend who had since moved away. He
remembered the large homes, long driveways, fancy cars, and front lawns
perfectly landscaped. They drove along a narrow road shaded with old
trees, and passed a few fairways and greens. The course was manicured,
like something out of a golf magazine. At every tee there were golfers
taking practice swings and on every green there were more bent over
their putters. Theo began to fret. He liked nothing more than eighteen
holes with his dad on an uncrowded course, yet nothing was more
unpleasant than trying to hit a ball with a foursome waiting and
watching impatiently from behind.</p>
<p>The clubhouse was busy. Dozens of golfers were out on this fine day.
Mr. Boone checked in with the starter, got a cart, and they began
limbering up at the practice range. Theo couldn’t help but look around,
hoping to catch a glimpse of Julio’s cousin. Or maybe he just might see
Pete Duffy himself, out for a few holes with some friends after a rough
week in court. He had posted bond the day of his arrest and had never
been near a jail cell.</p>
<p>And, the way the trial was going, he was unlikely to be locked
up.</p>
<p>But Theo saw neither man. The fact that he was thinking about them
meant that he was not thinking about his golf swing. He sprayed a few
balls around the range, and began to worry about his game.</p>
<p>They teed off on time, Mr. Boone from the blue tees, Theo from the
whites, a little farther down the fairway. His drive was a line shot
that barely covered a hundred yards.</p>
<p>“Keep your head down,“ his father said as they sped away in the cart.
There would be more advice as the day progressed. Mr. Boone had been
playing for thirty years and was an average golfer, and like most
golfers he often could not resist the urge to give advice, especially to
his son. Theo took it well. He needed lots of help.</p>
<p>There was a foursome in front of them and no one behind. The Creek
Course was shorter, narrower, and therefore, less favored by the other
golfers. It was designed to sort of follow the winding route of Waverly
Creek, a pretty but treacherous little stream known to devour golf
balls. The North Nine and South Nine were crowded, but not the Creek
Course.</p>
<p>As they sat in the cart by the tee box and waited for the foursome to
putt out on number three, Mr. Boone said, “Okay, Theo, here’s the plan.
Ike is looking for an apartment for the Pena family. Something small and
affordable. If they need a little help with the rent, then your mother
and I can kick in some money. This is something we’ve been talking about
for several months, so it’s nothing new. Ike, who’s got a big heart but
a small bank account, is willing to help, too. If we can find a place
real fast, then maybe Carola can convince her nephew, Julio’s cousin, to
live with them. It will be a much more stable environment for all of
them.</p>
<p>Ike is searching right now. And your mother is talking to immigration
attorneys. There might be a way, under federal law, to allow an illegal
immigrant to become legal if he has a sponsor who is a U.S. citizen, and
if he has a job. Let’s hit.“</p>
<p>They teed off, got back in the cart, and eased along the cart path.
Both drives were in the rough.</p>
<p>Mr. Boone continued as he drove. “Your mother and I are willing to
sponsor Julio’s cousin. I can probably find him a better job, a
legitimate one, and if he lives with his aunt and her family he can
probably obtain legal status within two years. Full citizenship is
another matter.“</p>
<p>“What’s the catch?“ Theo asked.</p>
<p>“There’s no real catch. We want to help the Pena family get out of
the shelter, and we’ll do so regardless of what happens to the cousin.
But we have to convince him to come forward and be willing to testify,
to tell the truth, to take the witness stand and tell the jury what he
saw.“</p>
<p>“And how do we convince him to do that?“</p>
<p>“That part of the plan is still evolving.“</p>
<p>Theo’s ball was near the cart path, a nice distance off the fairway.
He hit a five iron well and put the ball fifty yards from the green.</p>
<p>“Nice shot, Theo.“</p>
<p>“I get lucky every now and then.“</p>
<p>Number six was a dogleg to the left, a wider fairway with beautiful
homes along the right-hand boundary. From the tee box, they could see
the rear of the Duffy home 150 yards down the cart path. Next door to
it, a gardener was busy mowing grass. Theo thought, The way I’m hitting,
that man’s in danger.</p>
<p>But the gardener was not injured after both Boones teed off. They
crept along the cart path. Mr. Boone said, “You told me you had aerial
maps of this place.“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. At the office.“</p>
<p>“You think you can find the spot where our witness was hiding?“</p>
<p>“Maybe. It’s over there.“ Theo pointed to a patch of thick trees
across the fairway. They drove to the edge of the woods, got out, and
began stomping around like golfers do when they’ve hit bad shots and
can’t find their balls. A dry creek bed ran through the woods, and on
one side there was a short retaining wall of eight-by-eight treated
timbers. The perfect spot to sit and hide and have a quiet lunch, all
alone.</p>
<p>“That might be it,“ Theo said, pointing. “He said he was sitting on
some logs, with a perfect view of the house.“</p>
<p>Theo and Mr. Boone sat on the timbers. The view of the rear of the
Duffy house was unobstructed. “How far away, you think?“ asked Theo.</p>
<p>“A hundred yards,“ Mr. Boone said without hesitation, the way most
golfers readily estimate distances. “It’s a great hiding place. No one
would ever see him sitting here. No one would ever think to look in
these trees.“</p>
<p>“When you study the aerial, you can see the maintenance shed just
over there, through the woods.“ Theo was pointing in the other
direction, opposite the fairway. “According to the cousin, the workers
meet for lunch at eleven thirty at the shed. On most days, he slipped
away to eat by himself. I guess he came here.“</p>
<p>“I brought a camera. Let’s take some photos.“ Mr. Boone retrieved a
small digital camera from his golf bag on the cart. He photographed the
wooded area, the creek bed, the retaining wall, then turned and took
some of the fairway and the homes on the other side.</p>
<p>“What are the photos for?“ Theo asked when they were back in the
cart.</p>
<p>“We might need them.“</p>
<p>They took photos for a few minutes, then emerged from the woods and
were almost to the golf cart when Theo looked across the fairway. Pete
Duffy was standing on his patio, watching them through binoculars. There
were no other golfers around. “Dad,“ Theo said softly.</p>
<p>“I see him,“ Mr. Boone replied. “Let’s hit.“</p>
<p>They tried to ignore him as they hit their second shots, neither of
which landed anywhere near the green. They quickly hopped in the cart
and drove away. Pete Duffy never lowered the binoculars.</p>
<p>They finished nine holes in two hours, then decided to buzz around in
the cart to have a look at the North and South Courses. The layout of
Waverly Creek was impressive, with fine homes tucked neatly against some
of the fairways, a row of expensive condos wrapped around a small lake,
a park for children, biking and jogging trails that crisscrossed the
golf cart paths, and, most importantly, beautiful fairways and
greens.</p>
<p>A foursome was teeing off at number fourteen when they approached.
Golf etiquette demands silence around the tee, and Mr. Boone stopped the
cart before he and Theo could be seen. When the golfers took off,
Mr. Boone drove to the tee box. There was a watercooler, a trash can,
and a ball cleaner at the edge of the cart path near a row of
boxwoods.</p>
<p>Theo said, “According to Julio, his cousin saw the man drop the
gloves into the trash can on number fourteen. This must be it.“</p>
<p>“The cousin didn’t tell you this?“ Mr. Boone asked.</p>
<p>“No. I’ve talked to the cousin only once, Wednesday night at the
shelter. Julio came to our office the following night with the
gloves.“</p>
<p>“So we have no idea where the cousin was or how or why he saw the man
toss his gloves here at fourteen?“</p>
<p>“I guess not.“</p>
<p>“And we’re not sure why the cousin felt the need to get the
gloves?“</p>
<p>“According to Julio, the boys who work out here always go through the
trash.“</p>
<p>They quickly took some photos, then eased away as another foursome
approached.</p>
<p>After golf, Theo and his father stopped by the Highland Street
Shelter to check on Julio and his younger brother and sister. Carola
Pena washed dishes in the kitchen of a downtown hotel and worked every
Saturday, which meant her three children were left at the shelter. There
were games and activities for the children who lived there, but Theo
knew that Saturdays were not that pleasant. They watched a lot of
television, played kick ball on the small playground, and, if lucky,
rode a church bus to a cinema if a supervisor could find the money.</p>
<p>While Theo and his father were playing golf, they had an idea.
Stratten College was a small private school that had been founded in the
town a hundred years earlier. Its football and basketball teams couldn’t
compete with a decent high school, but its baseball team was a Division
III powerhouse. There was a doubleheader at 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Mr. Boone checked in with the supervisor at the shelter.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Julio, who was in charge of the twins,“ Hector and
Rita, jumped at the chance to leave the shelter. The three practically
ran to the SUV and jumped into the rear seat. Minutes later, Mr. Boone
stopped at the hotel, parked illegally at the curb, and said, “I’ll run
and tell Mrs. Pena what we’re doing.“ He was back in an instant, all
smiles, and reported, “Your mother thinks it’s a great idea.“</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Boone,“ Julio said. The twins were too excited to
speak.</p>
<p>Stratten College played its games at Rotary Park, a wonderful old
stadium on the edge of the town’s center, near the small campus. Rotary
Park was almost as old as the college and in years past had been the
home to several minor league teams, none of which stayed very long. Its
claim to fame was that a Hall of Famer, Ducky Medwick, had played one
season there in 1920 with a Double A team before moving on to the
Cardinals. There was a plaque near the front gate reminding fans of
Ducky’s brief stint in Strattenburg, but Theo had never seen anyone
reading it.</p>
<p>Mr. Boone bought the tickets at a booth with only one window. The
same old man had been working there since Ducky passed through. Three
dollars for an adult, a dollar each for the kids. “How about some
popcorn?“ Mr. Boone asked as he looked down at the glowing faces of
Hector and Rita. Five bags of popcorn, five sodas, twenty bucks. They
walked up a ramp and into the bleachers, just down from the home dugout
near first base. There were a lot of seats and few fans, and the ushers
didn’t care where they sat. The ballpark could hold two thousand, and
the old-timers liked to brag about how big the crowds used to be. Theo
watched five or six Stratten College games each season and had never
seen the stadium even remotely close to half full. He loved the place,
though, with its old-fashioned grandstand, overhanging roof, wooden
bleachers close to the field, bull pens next to the foul lines, and an
outfield wall covered with brightly painted ads for everything in
Strattenburg from pest control to a local beer to lawyers in need of
injured clients. A real ballpark.</p>
<p>There were those who wanted to tear it down. It was practically empty
in the summertime, after the college season ended, and there were gripes
about how much it cost for upkeep. This puzzled Theo because, looking
around, it was hard to pinpoint exactly where any “upkeep“ money was
spent.</p>
<p>They stood for the national anthem, then Stratten College took the
field. The four kids sat close together while Mr. Boone sat on the row
behind them, listening. “All right,“ said Theo, the boss. “Nothing but
English, okay? We’re working on our English.“</p>
<p>The Pena children naturally slid back into Spanish when chatting
among themselves, but they instantly obeyed Theo and switched to
English. Hector and Rita were eight years old and knew little about
baseball. Theo began explaining.</p>
<p>Mrs. Boone and Ike arrived in the third inning and sat with
Mr. Boone, who had eased away from the children. Theo tried to listen as
they whispered among themselves. Ike had found an apartment, with rent
of five hundred dollars a month. Mrs. Boone had not yet discussed the
matter with Carola Pena because she was working at the hotel. They
talked about other matters, but Theo couldn’t catch it all.</p>
<p>Baseball can be boring for eight-year-olds who don’t understand it,
and by the fifth inning Hector and Rita were tossing popcorn and
crawling around the bleachers. Mrs. Boone asked them if they wanted ice
cream, and they jumped at the offer. When they left, Theo made his move.
He asked Julio if he wanted to see the game from the center field
bleachers. He said yes, and they drifted along the grandstand, past the
bull pen, and eventually settled into an old section of seating just
over the right center field wall. They were alone.</p>
<p>“I like the view from out here,“ Theo said. “Plus, it’s always
empty.“</p>
<p>“I like it, too,“ Julio said.</p>
<p>They talked about the center fielder for a moment, then Theo changed
subjects. “Look, Julio, we need to talk about your cousin. I can’t
remember his name. In fact, I’m not sure I’ve ever known his name.“</p>
<p>“Bobby.“</p>
<p>“Bobby?“</p>
<p>“It’s really Roberto, but he likes to go by Bobby.“</p>
<p>“Okay. Is his last name Pena?“</p>
<p>“No. His mother and my mother are sisters. His last name is
Escobar.“</p>
<p>“Bobby Escobar.“</p>
<p>“Si. Yes.“</p>
<p>“Does he still work at the golf course?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“And he still lives by the Quarry?“</p>
<p>“Yes. Why do you ask?“</p>
<p>“He’s a very important person right now, Julio. He needs to come
forward and tell the police everything he saw the day the woman was
murdered.“</p>
<p>Julio turned and looked at Theo as if he’d lost his mind. “He can’t
do that.“</p>
<p>“Maybe he can. What if he could be promised protection? No arrest. No
jail. Do you know what the word immunity means?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Well, in legal terms, it means he might be able to cut a deal with
the police. If he comes forward and testifies, then the police won’t
bother him. He’ll be immune. There may even be a way for him to get
legal papers.“</p>
<p>“Have you talked to the police?“</p>
<p>“No way, Julio.“</p>
<p>“Have you told anyone?“</p>
<p>“I have protected his identity. He is safe, Julio. But I need to talk
to him.“</p>
<p>A player for the other team hit a ball that bounced off the right
field wall. They watched him slide into third for a triple. Theo had to
explain the difference between the ball going over the wall and one
bouncing against it. Julio said there wasn’t much baseball in El
Salvador. Mainly soccer.</p>
<p>“When will you see Bobby again?“ Theo asked.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, maybe. He usually comes to the shelter on Sunday and we
walk to church.“</p>
<p>“Is there any way I can talk to him tonight?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I don’t know what he’s doing all the time.“</p>
<p>“Julio, time is crucial here.“</p>
<p>“What’s crucial?“</p>
<p>“Very important. The trial will be over on Monday. It’s important for
Bobby to come forward and tell what he saw.“</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.“</p>
<p>“Julio, both of my parents are lawyers. You know them. They can be
trusted. What if they were able to find an apartment for you and your
family, including Bobby, a nice place just for you guys, and, at the
same time, my parents take steps to sponsor Bobby so he can become
legal? Think about it. No more hiding from the police. No more worrying
about raids from the immigration people. You guys can all live together
and Bobby will have papers. Wouldn’t that be cool?“</p>
<p>Julio was staring into space, soaking it in. “That’d be awesome,
Theo.“</p>
<p>“Then here’s what we do. First, you say it’s okay to involve my
parents. They’ll be on your side. They’re lawyers.“</p>
<p>“Okay.“</p>
<p>“Great. Next, you gotta see Bobby and convince him that this is a
good deal. Convince him we can be trusted. Can you do that?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know.“</p>
<p>“Has he told your mother about what he saw?“</p>
<p>“Yes. She’s like a mother to Bobby.“</p>
<p>“Good. Get your mother to talk to him, too. She can convince
him.“</p>
<p>“You promise he won’t go to jail?“</p>
<p>“I promise.“</p>
<p>“But he has to talk to the police?“</p>
<p>“Maybe not the police, but he has to talk to someone involved with
the trial. Maybe the judge. I don’t know. But it’s crucial for Bobby to
come forward. He’s the most important witness in this murder trial.“</p>
<p>Julio placed his head in both hands, elbows on knees. His shoulders
slumped under the weight of Theo’s words and plans. For a long time
nothing was said. Theo watched Hector and Rita in the distance, sitting
with his mother and chatting away with their ice cream. Woods and Ike
were deep in conversation, a rarity for them. The game dragged on.</p>
<p>“What do I do now?“ Julio asked.</p>
<p>“Talk to your mother. Then both of you talk to Bobby. We should all
get together.“</p>
<p>“Okay.“</p>
<p>Theo was in the den watching a movie on cable when his cell phone
vibrated in his pocket. It was eight thirty five, Saturday night, and
the call was coming from the shelter. He flipped the phone open, said,
“Hello.“ Julio’s unmistakable voice said, “Theo?“</p>
<p>“Yes, Julio, what’s up?“ Theo muted the television. His father was in
the study reading a novel and his mother was upstairs in bed, sipping
green tea and reading through a pile of legal documents.</p>
<p>“I’ve talked to Bobby,“ Julio said, “and boy is he scared. The police
were all over the Quarry today, checking papers, looking for trouble.
They took in two boys from Guatemala, both illegal. Bobby thinks they’re
after him.“</p>
<p>Theo walked to the study as he spoke. “Listen, Julio, if the police
are after Bobby it has nothing to do with the murder trial. I can
promise you that.“ Theo stood next to his father, who closed his book
and listened closely.</p>
<p>“They went to his house, but he was hiding down the street.“</p>
<p>“Did you talk to him, Julio? Did you tell him what we discussed today
at the game?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“And what did he say?“</p>
<p>“He’s too scared right now, Theo. He doesn’t understand how things
work here. When he sees a policeman, he thinks bad things. You know? He
thinks about going to jail, losing his job, his money, getting sent back
home.“</p>
<p>“Julio, listen to me,“ Theo said, frowning at his father. “He will
not have to deal with the police. If he’ll just trust me and my parents,
he’ll be safer. Did you explain this?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Does he understand it?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Theo. But he wants to talk to you.“</p>
<p>“Great. I’ll talk to him.“ Theo nodded at his father and his father
nodded back. “When and where?“</p>
<p>“Well, he’s moving around tonight, not staying at his place. He’s
afraid the police might come back in the middle of the night and arrest
them. But I can reach him.“</p>
<p>Theo almost asked How? but let it go. “I think we should talk
tonight,“ Theo said. His father nodded again.</p>
<p>“Okay. What do I tell him?“</p>
<p>“Tell him to meet me somewhere.“</p>
<p>“Where?“</p>
<p>Theo couldn’t think of a place fast enough. His father was a step
ahead. He whispered, “Truman Park, by the carousel.“</p>
<p>Theo said, “How about Truman Park?“</p>
<p>“Where’s that?“</p>
<p>“It’s the big park at the end of Main Street where they have the
water fountains and statues and stuff like that. Anybody can find Truman
Park.“</p>
<p>“Okay.“</p>
<p>“Tell him to be there at nine thirty, in about an hour. Meet us by
the carousel.“</p>
<p>“What’s a carousel?“</p>
<p>“It’s a fancy merry-go-round with little fake ponies and loud music.
It’s for small kids and their mothers.“</p>
<p>“I’ve seen it.“</p>
<p>“Good. Nine thirty.“</p>
<p>The carousel was still spinning slowly late on Saturday night. Its
well-used speakers boomed out the notes of “It’s a</p>
<p>Small World“ as a few toddlers and their mothers clutched the poles
that ran down the center of the red and yellow ponies. Nearby there was
a booth selling cotton candy and lemonade. A gang of young teenagers
loitered about, all smoking and trying to look tough.</p>
<p>Woods Boone surveyed the area and felt it was safe. “I’ll be waiting
over there,“ he said, pointing to a tall bronze statue of a forgotten
war hero. “You won’t see me.“</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine,“ Theo said. He wasn’t worried about safety. The park
was well lit and well used.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Julio and Bobby Escobar eased from the shadows and
saw Theo before he saw them. Bobby was very nervous and did not want to
risk being seen by a policeman, so they walked to the other side of the
park and found a spot on the steps of a gazebo. Theo couldn’t see his
father but he was sure he was watching.</p>
<p>He asked Bobby if he had worked that day, then went on to say that he
and his father had played the Creek Course. No, Bobby had not worked,
but instead had spent the day dodging cops. This opened the door, and
Theo went charging through. He explained, in English, that Bobby had the
opportunity to make a big change. He could move beyond being an illegal
alien to a sponsored immigrant going through the process of getting
proper documentation.</p>
<p>Julio rendered in Spanish. Theo understood little of it.</p>
<p>He explained that his parents were offering the deal of a lifetime. A
better place to live, with family, the chance of a better job, and the
fast track to being a legal resident. No more hiding from the police. No
more fears about getting shipped home.</p>
<p>Julio rendered in Spanish. Bobby listened with a stone face, no
expression at all.</p>
<p>Getting nothing in return, Theo pressed on. It was important to keep
talking. Bobby seemed to be on the verge of running away. “Explain to
him that he is a very important witness in the murder trial,“ Theo said
to Julio. “And there is nothing wrong with going to court and telling
everybody what he saw that day.“</p>
<p>Julio rendered. Bobby nodded. He’d heard this before. He said
something, which Julio translated as, “He doesn’t want to get involved.
This trial is not his problem.“</p>
<p>A police car stopped at the edge of the park, not close to the gazebo
but certainly close enough to be seen. Bobby watched it fearfully, as if
he’d finally been caught. He mumbled quickly to Julio, who shot
something back.</p>
<p>“The police are not after Bobby,“ Theo said. “Tell him to relax.“</p>
<p>Two policemen crawled out of the car and began walking toward the
center of the park, to the carousel. “See,“ Theo said. “The fat one is
Ramsey Ross. All he does is write parking tickets. Don’t know the other
one. They couldn’t care less about us.“</p>
<p>Julio explained this in Spanish and Bobby began breathing again.</p>
<p>“Where will he stay tonight?“ Theo asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. He asked if he could sleep at the shelter, but there’s
no room.“</p>
<p>“He can stay with us. We have an extra bedroom. You can come along,
too. We’ll call it a slumber party. My dad will stop and get us a pizza.
Let’s go.“</p>
<p>At midnight, the three boys were sprawled around the den, yelling at
the TV screen as they played a video game. Pillows and quilts were
strewn about. Two large pizza boxes lay in ruins. Judge was munching on
a crust.</p>
<p>From time to time, Marcella and Woods Boone peeked in. They were
amused to hear Theo plow ahead with his Spanish, always a beat or two
behind Julio and Bobby, but determined to catch up.</p>
<p>They had wanted more children, but nature didn’t cooperate. And, at
times, they had to admit that Theo was more than enough.</p>
<p>Judge Gantry waited until it was dark early Sunday evening to go for
a long walk. He lived a few blocks from the courthouse, in an old house
that had been handed down from his grandfather, himself a distinguished
judge, and he often roamed the streets in the center of Strattenburg in
the early mornings and in the late evenings. On this night, he needed
fresh air, time to think. The Duffy trial had consumed his weekend. He
had spent hours buried in the law books looking for an answer, one that
still eluded him. A heated argument raged within. Why should he disrupt
a properly tried case? Why should he declare a mistrial when nothing had
gone wrong? No rules had been broken. No ethics violated. Nothing. In
fact, with two fine lawyers doing battle the trial had sailed smoothly
along.</p>
<p>His research had revealed no similar case.</p>
<p>The lights were on at Boone &amp; Boone. At seven thirty, as
promised, Judge Gantry stepped onto the small front porch and knocked on
the door.</p>
<p>It was opened by Marcella Boone, who said, “Well, good evening,
Henry. Come in.“</p>
<p>“Good evening, Marcella. I haven’t seen this office in at least
twenty years.“</p>
<p>“Then you should stop by more often.“ She closed the door behind
them.</p>
<p>Judge Gantry wasn’t the only one having a brisk walk in the early
evening. A man named Paco was out for a stroll, too. Paco wore a dark
jogging suit, with running shoes, and he had a radio. He kept his
distance and since the judge never thought about being followed, he was
easy to trail. They roamed through central Strattenburg, one man deep in
serious thought and oblivious to anyone around him, the other a block
behind, carefully stalking as the shadows grew long and daylight
disappeared. When Henry Gantry walked into Boone &amp; Boone after dark,
Paco jogged by the office, I got the name and street number, and kept
going until he turned the corner. Then he clicked a button on his
two-way radio and said, “He’s inside, at the Boones.“</p>
<p>“Okay. I’m close by.“ The response came from Omar Cheepe.</p>
<p>Moments later, Cheepe picked up Paco, and they turned onto Park
Street. When the Boone &amp; Boone building was visible, they quietly
eased into a parking place far down the street. Cheepe turned off the
lights and the engine and rolled down his window for a smoke. “Did you
see him go in?“ he asked.</p>
<p>“No,“ Paco said. “I saw him turn off the sidewalk and head for the
front door. I know he’s in there. It’s the only place open along
here.“</p>
<p>“Very strange.“</p>
<p>It was Sunday night, and the other office buildings were dark and
deserted. Only the Boone firm showed signs of activity. All of its
downstairs lights appeared to be on.</p>
<p>“What do you think they’re doing?“ Paco asked.</p>
<p>“Not sure. The Boones were in Gantry’s office Friday, the whole
family, which makes no sense because Gantry was very busy. They’re not
criminal lawyers, you know. He drafts deeds and she handles divorces, so
there’s no reason to barge into Gantry’s office in the middle of a
murder trial.</p>
<p>And the kid, I just don’t get it. Why would the parents take the kid
out of school and in to see Gantry? The kid’s been hanging around all
week, snooping around the trial.“</p>
<p>“This is Theo?“</p>
<p>“Yep. Kid thinks he’s a lawyer. Knows every cop, every judge, every
court clerk. Hangs around courtrooms, probably knows more law than most
lawyers. He and Gantry are big pals. He goes to see Gantry, with his
parents, and, suddenly, Gantry decides not to hold court on Saturday,
after promising all week. Something’s going on here, Paco. And it’s not
in our favor.“</p>
<p>“You talked to Nance or Mr. Duffy?“</p>
<p>“No, not yet. Here’s what we do. I would almost send you up there to
poke around the building, look inside, see who’s there, but it’s too
risky. They see you, they get spooked, they stop whatever they’re doing,
maybe they call the cops. It is Judge Gantry, you know. Things could get
complicated. So here’s a better plan. I’ll call Gus and get the van. We
can park it closer up the street, and when they come out we take
pictures. I want to know who’s in there.“</p>
<p>“Who do you think?“</p>
<p>“Don’t know, Paco, but I’ll bet a hundred bucks the Boone family and
Gantry are not in there playing gin rummy. Something’s going on here,
and I don’t like it.“</p>
<p>Judge Gantry walked to the library, where Mr. Boone, Ike, and Theo
were waiting. The long table that dominated the room was covered with
books, maps, notepads, and gave the impression that a lot of work was
under way. Everyone shook hands, said their hellos. There was some small
talk about the weather, but with important matters looming the chitchat
didn’t last long.</p>
<p>“Needless to say,“ Judge Gantry said after they were all seated,
“this little meeting is off the record. We’re doing nothing wrong, mind
you, since you’re not involved in the case. But, I can hear a lot of
questions being asked if word got out. Understood?“</p>
<p>“Of course, Henry,“ Mrs. Boone said.</p>
<p>“No problem,“ Ike said.</p>
<p>“Not a word,“ Mr. Boone said.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,“ Theo said.</p>
<p>“Good. Now, you said that you have something to show me.“</p>
<p>The three adult Boones looked at Theo, who immediately jumped to his
feet. His laptop was on the table in front of him. He touched a key, and
a large photo appeared on the digital wide-screen whiteboard at the end
of the room. Theo held a laser pointer and directed the red light at the
photo. “This is an aerial photo of the sixth fairway at the Creek
Course. Over here is the Duffy home. Over here, in the trees in the
dogleg, is where the witness was sitting and having lunch.“ He pressed
another key, another photo appeared. “This is a photo we took yesterday
morning at the golf course. The witness was sitting on this stack of
treated timbers, next to the dry streambed, completely hidden from view.
However“–another key, another photo–“as you can see, the witness had a
perfect view of the homes on the other side of the fairway, about a
hundred yards away.“</p>
<p>“And you know for certain this is exactly where he was?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“Can you reconstruct the time?“</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Honor.“</p>
<p>“We can drop the ‘Your Honor’ stuff, Theo, for the time being.“</p>
<p>“Okay.“ Another photo, an aerial. Theo beamed the laser light at a
building. “This is the maintenance shed, not too far through the woods
from the sixth fairway. The lunch break began at eleven thirty. Eleven
thirty on the dot because the supervisor ran a tight ship and expected
his workers to check in at eleven thirty, eat quickly, and be back on
the job at noon. Our man liked to sneak away from the others, eat by
himself, say his prayers, and look at a photo of his family back home.
He’s very homesick. As you can see, it’s a short walk through the woods
to his favorite lunch spot. He estimates that he was halfway through his
lunch break when he saw the man enter the Duffy home.“</p>
<p>“So around eleven forty-five?“ Judge Gantry asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. And, as you know, the pathologist put the time of death at
approximately eleven forty-five.“</p>
<p>“I know. And the man who entered the house then left it before your
witness finished his lunch break?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. The witness says that he usually heads back to the
maintenance shed a few minutes before noon. On this day, he saw the man
come out of the house before he finished the lunch break. He estimates
the man was in the house less than ten minutes.“</p>
<p>“I have one big question,“ the judge said. “Did this witness see the
man leave the house with a bag or sack or anything that might hold the
stolen loot? The testimony is that several items were taken–two small
handguns, some of her jewelry, and at least three of his expensive
watches. Did the witness see this stuff hauled away?“</p>
<p>“I don’t think so, Judge,“ Theo said gravely. “And, I’ve thought
about this for hours. My best guess is that he stuffed the guns under
his belt, hid them with his sweater, and put everything else in his
pockets.“</p>
<p>“What kind of guns?“ Mr. Boone asked.</p>
<p>“A nine millimeter and a snub-nosed thirty-eight,“ Judge Gantry said.
“It would be easy to hide them under a sweater.“</p>
<p>“And the watches and jewelry?“</p>
<p>“Some rings and necklaces, three watches with leather bands. All
could fit easily into the front pockets of a pair of slacks.“</p>
<p>“And this stuff was never found?“ Mrs. Boone asked.</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“They’re probably at the bottom of one of those lakes out there at
the golf course,“ Ike said with a nasty grin.</p>
<p>“You’re probably right,“ Judge Gantry said, to the amazement of
everyone else. The stone-faced referee who never leaned to one side or
the other had just tipped his hand. He thought Mr. Pete Duffy was guilty
after all.</p>
<p>“What about the gloves?“ he asked.</p>
<p>Theo picked up a small brown box, sat it on the table, and then
pulled out the Ziploc plastic bag holding the two golf gloves. He placed
it in front of Judge Gantry, and for a second or two everyone stared at
the evidence as if it were a bloody butcher’s knife. Theo pressed a key,
and another photo appeared on the screen. “This is the fourteenth tee
box, South Nine. The witness was repairing a sprinkler head right about
here, on a small hill overlooking the tee box, when he saw the man, the
same man, remove these two gloves from his golf bag and throw them in
the trash basket.“</p>
<p>“A question,“ Judge Gantry said. “At the moment he tossed away these
gloves, was he wearing another set of gloves?“ It was obvious to the
Boones that the judge had dissected every detail of the story.</p>
<p>“I’ve never asked him that question,“ Theo said.</p>
<p>“Probably so,“ Woods said. “It’s not unusual for a golfer to keep
extra gloves in his bag.“</p>
<p>“Why would that matter?“ Mrs. Boone asked.</p>
<p>“Not sure that it would. I’m just very curious right now,
Marcella.“</p>
<p>There was a long pause, as if those present were thinking the same
thing but no one wanted to mention it. Finally, Theo said, “Judge, you
could always ask the witness.“</p>
<p>“So he’s here?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“He’s in my office, Henry,“ Mrs. Boone said. “He’s now represented by
the Boone law firm.“</p>
<p>“Does that include Theo?“ Judge Gantry asked, and everyone thought it
was somewhat funny.</p>
<p>“You have to assure us, Henry, that he will not be arrested or
prosecuted for anything,“ Mr. Boone said.</p>
<p>“You have my word,“ Judge Gantry said.</p>
<p>Bobby Escobar sat across the table from the judge. To his left was
Julio, his cousin and interpreter, and to his right was his aunt Carola.
It was a family affair with Hector and Rita back in Mrs. Boone’s office
watching television.</p>
<p>Theo began his direct examination with the same aerial photo of the
sixth fairway, Creek Course. With the red laser light, he and Bobby
pinpointed the exact spot where he’d been eating his lunch. Theo changed
photos, asked his questions carefully, and gave Julio plenty of time to
translate. The story unfolded perfectly.</p>
<p>Woods, Marcella, and Ike sat back and watched with enormous pride,
but all three were ready to catch any mistake.</p>
<p>Once the facts were established and Bobby had established himself as
a reliable witness, Judge Gantry said, “Now, let’s talk about
identification.“</p>
<p>Since Bobby had never met Pete Duffy, he could not say that he was
the man who entered the house. He did say that the man was wearing a
black sweater, tan slacks, and a maroon golf cap, the same outfit Pete
Duffy was wearing at the time of the murder. Theo flashed up a series of
photos of Pete Duffy, all taken from the newspaper. To each, Bobby could
only say that the man in the photo definitely resembled the man he’d
seen. Theo pressed another key and ran three quick videos he’d strung
together, all showing Pete Duffy either walking into the courthouse or
walking out. Again, Bobby said he was almost certain that was the
man.</p>
<p>Then, the clincher. The prosecution had placed into evidence
twenty-two photographs of the crime scene, the house, and the
neighborhood. One of the photos, State’s Exhibit No. 15, had been taken
from a position somewhere near the edge of the fairway. It showed the
rear of the Duffy home, its patio, windows, rear door, and off to the
far right there were two uniformed policeman standing next to a golf
cart. Sitting in the golf cart was Pete Duffy, who appeared dazed and
distraught. The photo had apparently been taken just minutes after he
raced home from the Clubhouse Grill.</p>
<p>Theo had obtained the photograph by “visiting“ the site maintained by
the court reporting service. If Judge Gantry asked how he got it, Theo
was prepared to say, “Well, Judge, it’s been produced in open court and
admitted into evidence. Not really a secret, is it?“</p>
<p>But Judge Gantry said nothing. He’d seen the photo a hundred times
and was unmoved by it. Bobby, though, had never seen it, and he
immediately began speaking rapidly to Julio.</p>
<p>“That’s him,“ Julio said, actually pointing. “The man in the cart.
That’s him.“</p>
<p>“Let the record show, Your Honor, that the witness has just
identified the defendant, Mr. Peter Duffy.“</p>
<p>“Got it, Theo,“ Gantry said.</p>
<p>The spectators gathered Monday morning for the final drama. The
jurors arrived with solemn faces, determined to finish the job. The
lawyers wore their finest suits and appeared fresh and eager to get
their verdict. The defendant himself looked rested, confident. The
clerks and bailiffs hustled about with their usual early morning energy.
But when they grew still, at ten minutes after 9:00 a.m., the courtroom
seemed to inhale and wait. Everyone stood when Judge Gantry entered, his
black robe flowing behind. He said, “Please be seated,“ and did not
smile. He was not happy. He seemed very tired.</p>
<p>He looked around the courtroom, nodded at his court reporter,
acknowledged his jury, noticed the crowd and in particular looked at the
third row, right side. There was Theo Boone, wedged between his father
and his uncle, absent from school, at least for the moment. Judge Gantry
looked at Theo and their eyes locked. Then he leaned down a few inches
closer to the microphone. He cleared his throat and began to deliver the
words no one expected.</p>
<p>“Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. At this point in the trial of
Mr. Peter Duffy, we are scheduled to hear the closing arguments from the
lawyers. However, this will not happen. For reasons that I will not
explain at this moment, I am declaring a mistrial.“</p>
<p>There were gasps, jolts, shocked expressions from all corners of the
courtroom. Theo was watching Pete Duffy, whose jaw dropped to his chest
as he turned to Clifford Nance. The lawyers on both sides appeared to
have been hit between the eyes, all staggering as they tried to
understand what they had just heard. On the front row, directly behind
the defense table, Omar Cheepe turned and looked straight at Theo, two
rows back. He didn’t stare, didn’t look particularly menacing, but his
timing said it all–“You did this. I know it. And I’m not finished.“</p>
<p>The jurors were not sure what would happen next, so Judge Gantry
explained it to them. He turned, looked at them, and said, “Members of
the jury, a mistrial means that the trial is over. The charges against
Mr. Peter Duffy are dismissed, but only for the moment. The charges will
be filed again, and there will be another trial in the very near future,
but with a different jury. In any criminal trial, the judge has the
absolute discretion to declare a mistrial when he or she believes that
something has happened that might adversely affect the final verdict.
Such is the case now. I thank you for your service. You are important to
our judicial system. You are now excused.“</p>
<p>The jurors were thoroughly bewildered, but some were beginning to
understand that their civic duty was over. A bailiff herded them through
a side door. As they shuffled out, Theo watched and admired Judge
Gantry. At that moment, he, Theo, decided that he wanted to be a great
judge, just like his hero up there on the bench. A judge who knew the
law inside and out and believed in fairness, but, more importantly, a
judge who could make the tough decision.</p>
<p>“Told you so,“ Ike whispered. Ike had been convinced that a mistrial
would be declared, but then so had the rest of the Boone law firm.</p>
<p>The jurors left but no one else moved. They were stunned and wanted
more information. At the same time, Jack Hogan and Clifford Nance rose
slowly and looked at Judge Gantry.</p>
<p>Before either could speak, he said, “Gentlemen, I will not explain my
actions at this time. Tomorrow, at ten a.m., we will meet in my office
and I will state my reasons. I want the charges refiled as soon as
possible. I will schedule the retrial for the third week in June. The
defendant will remain free on bond with the same restrictions. Court is
adjourned.“ He slapped his gavel on the bench, stood, and then
vanished.</p>
<p>With the judge and jury gone, there wasn’t much left to do. The crowd
slowly climbed to its feet and headed for the door.</p>
<p>“Get to school,“ Mr. Boone said sternly to Theo.</p>
<p>Outside the courthouse, Theo unchained his bike. “You stopping by
this afternoon?“ Ike asked.</p>
<p>“Sure,“ Theo said. “It’s Monday.“</p>
<p>“We need to debrief. It’s been a long week.“</p>
<p>“Sure has.“</p>
<p>Not far away, at the front entrance, there was noise and the rush of
people trying to get out of the courthouse. Pete Duffy, surrounded by
his lawyers and others, hustled away with a couple of reporters yelling
questions at him. The questions were not answered. Omar Cheepe brought
up the rear, and actually shoved one of the reporters. He was about to
take off with his client when he noticed Theo, straddling his bike,
watching the drama with Ike. Cheepe froze, and for a split second seemed
undecided about what to do. Should he hurry and protect Mr. Duffy, or
should he walk over to Theo and utter a vile threat or two?</p>
<p>Theo and Cheepe stared at each other, fifty feet apart, then Cheepe
turned and scampered away. Ike seemed not to notice this exchange.</p>
<p>Theo hurried away, too. He headed for school, and once the courthouse
was far behind him, he began to relax. He found it difficult to believe
that it was Monday. So much had happened in the past seven days. The
biggest trial in the town’s history had come and gone, yet it wasn’t
over. Thanks to Theo, a bad verdict had been avoided. Justice had been
preserved, at least for the time being. He would take a break from his
duties, but before long he would be meeting secretly with Bobby Escobar
and Julio. No doubt about it. Theo would be in charge of coaching Bobby,
preparing him for the three hours he would spend on the witness stand
come June.</p>
<p>And now Omar the Creep was complicating things. How much did he and
his client and Clifford Nance really know? Questions, questions. Theo
was puzzled, but he was already excited.</p>
<p>Then he thought of April. Tomorrow, Tuesday, the judge would issue a
ruling that would require her to live with one parent or the other. Her
presence would not be required in court, but she was a wreck anyway.
Theo needed to spend some time with her. He decided that they would
sneak away at lunch and talk about things.</p>
<p>And he thought about Woody, whose brother was in jail and likely to
stay there.</p>
<p>He parked his bike at the flagpole and walked into the school halfway
through first period. He had a written excuse from his mother, and as he
handed it over to Miss Gloria in the front office he noticed that she
wasn’t smiling. She always smiled.</p>
<p>“Have a seat, Theo,“ she said, nodding to a wooden chair beside her
desk.</p>
<p>But why? Theo wondered. It’s just a simple matter of being tardy.</p>
<p>“How was the funeral?“ she asked, still unsmiling.</p>
<p>A pause, as Theo tried to understand. “I’m sorry.“</p>
<p>“The funeral last Friday, the one your uncle came here…“</p>
<p>“Oh, that funeral. It was great. A real blast.“</p>
<p>She looked around nervously, then tapped her lips with an index
finger. Please talk softly, she was saying. There were open office doors
nearby.</p>
<p>“Theo,“ she almost whispered. “My brother was stopped last night for
driving under the influence. They took him to jail.“ She rolled her eyes
around to make sure they were alone.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,“ Theo said. He knew where this was going.</p>
<p>“He’s not a drunk. He’s a grown man with a wife and kids and a good
job. He’s never been in trouble and we just don’t know what to do.“</p>
<p>“What was his BAC?“</p>
<p>“What?“</p>
<p>“His blood alcohol content.“</p>
<p>“Oh, that. Does point zero nine sound right?“</p>
<p>“Yes. The limit is point zero eight, so he’s in trouble. First
offense?“</p>
<p>“Why heavens yes, Theo. He’s not a drunk. He barely had two glasses
of wine.“</p>
<p>Two drinks. Always two drinks. Regardless of how drunk or how sloppy
or how belligerent, they’ve never had more than two drinks.</p>
<p>“The policeman said he could get ten days in jail,“ she went on.
“This is so embarrassing.“</p>
<p>“Which cop?“ Theo asked.</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to know that?“</p>
<p>“Some of the cops like to scare people. Your brother will not get ten
days. He’ll pay a fine of six hundred dollars, lose his license for six
months, go to driving school, and a year from now his record can be
expunged. Did he spend the entire night in jail?“</p>
<p>“Yes. I can’t imagine …“</p>
<p>“Then there’s no more jail time. Write down this name.“ She was
already holding a pen. “Taylor Baskin,“ Theo said. “He’s the lawyer who
handles all the drunks …“</p>
<p>“He’s not a drunk!“ she said, a bit too loud. Both looked around to
see if anyone was listening. No one.</p>
<p>“Sorry. Taylor Baskin is the drunk driving lawyer. Your brother needs
to call him.“</p>
<p>Miss Gloria was scribbling away.</p>
<p>“I need to get to class,“ Theo said.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Theo. Please don’t tell anyone.“</p>
<p>“No problem. Can I go now?“</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, please. And thanks, Theo.“</p>
<p>He scampered out of the office, leaving behind another satisfied
client.</p>
