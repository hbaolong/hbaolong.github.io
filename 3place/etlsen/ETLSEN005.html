<h4 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h4>
<p>Every Monday of his life, Theo was reminded by his mother that the
day was in fact Monday, and this meant two things: first, Theo was
expected to spend at least thirty minutes with Ike, and, second, that
dinner would be Italian food at Robilio’s. The visit to Robilio’s was
more pleasant than the visit with Ike.</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am,“ he said as he placed her documents in his backpack.
“I’ll see you at Robilio’s.“</p>
<p>“Yes, dear, at seven.“</p>
<p>“Got it,“ he said, opening the back door. He explained to Judge that
he would be back in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Dinner was always at seven. When they ate at home, which was rare
because his mother didn’t enjoy cooking, they ate at seven. When they
went out, they ate at seven. When they were on vacation, seven. When
they visited friends they couldn’t be so rude as to suggest a time for
dinner, but since all their friends knew how important seven was to the
Boone family, they usually accommodated them. Occasionally, when Theo
stayed over with a pal or went camping or was out of town for some
reason, he took great delight in eating dinner before or after
seven.</p>
<p>Five minutes later he parked his bike at a rack in front of the
courthouse and locked the chain. Family Court was on the third floor,
next door to Probate Court and down the hall from Criminal Court. There
were a lot of other courts in the building–Traffic, Property, Small
Claims, Drug, Animal, Civil, Bankruptcy, and probably one or two Theo
had not yet discovered. He hoped to find April, but she was not there.
The courtroom was deserted. The hallways were empty. He opened the glass
door to the clerk’s office and stepped inside. Jenny, the beautiful, was
waiting. “Well, hello, Theo,“ she said with a big smile as she looked up
from her computer at the long counter. “Hello, Jenny,“ he said. She was
very pretty and young and Theo was in love. He would marry Jenny
tomorrow if he could, but his age and her husband complicated things.
Plus, she was pregnant, and this bothered Theo, though he mentioned it
to no one. “These are from my mother,“ Theo said as he handed over the
papers. Jenny took them, studied them for a moment, then said, “My, my,
more divorces.“ Theo just stared at her.</p>
<p>She stamped and scribbled and went about the process of officially
recording the papers.</p>
<p>Theo just stared at her.</p>
<p>“Are you going to the trial tomorrow?“ he asked, finally.</p>
<p>“I might slip down if I can get away. You?“</p>
<p>“Yes. Can’t wait.“</p>
<p>“Should be interesting, huh?“</p>
<p>Theo leaned in a little closer and said, “You think he’s guilty?“
Jenny leaned even closer and glanced around as if their secrets were
important. “I sure do. What about you?“</p>
<p>“Well, he’s presumed to be innocent.“</p>
<p>“You spend too much time hanging around the law office, Theo. I asked
what you think, off the record, of course.“</p>
<p>“I think he’s guilty.“</p>
<p>“We’ll see, won’t we?“ She gave him a quick smile, then turned away
to finish her business. “Say, Jenny. That trial this morning, the
Finnemore case, I guess it’s over, right?“ She glanced around
suspiciously, as if they were not supposed to be discussing an ongoing
case. “Judge Sanford adjourned at four this afternoon, to be continued
in the morning.“</p>
<p>“Were you in the courtroom?“</p>
<p>“No. Why do you ask, Theo?“</p>
<p>“I go to school with April Finnemore. Her parents are divorcing. Just
curious.“</p>
<p>“I see,“ she said with a sad frown.</p>
<p>Theo just stared at her.</p>
<p>“Bye, Theo.“</p>
<p>Down the hall, the courtroom was locked. A bailiff with no gun and a
tight, faded uniform was near the main door. Theo knew all the bailiffs
and this one, Deputy Gossett, was one of the grumpier ones. Mr. Boone
had explained that the bailiffs are usually the older and slower
policemen who are nearing the end of their careers. They are given new
titles– “bailiffs“–and reassigned to the courthouse, where things are
duller and safer than on the streets. “Hello, Theo,“ Deputy Gossett said
with no smile. “Hi, Deputy Gossett.“</p>
<p>“What brings you around here?“</p>
<p>“Just filing stuff for my parents.“</p>
<p>“Is that all?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“You sure you’re not snooping around here to see if the courtroom is
ready for the big trial?“</p>
<p>“That, too.“</p>
<p>“That’s what I figured. We’ve had some traffic today. A television
news crew just left. Should be interesting.“</p>
<p>“Are you working tomorrow?“</p>
<p>“Of course I’m working tomorrow,“ Deputy Gossett said, and his chest
puffed out a little, as if the trial would be impossible to put on
without him. “Security will be tight.“</p>
<p>“Why?“ Theo asked, though he knew why. Deputy Gossett thought he knew
a lot about the law, as if he’d absorbed a great body of knowledge just
because he sat through trials and hearings. (He was often half asleep.)
And, like many people who don’t know as much as they think they know,
Deputy Gossett was quick to share his insights with the less
informed.</p>
<p>He glanced at his watch as if he had a tight schedule. “It’s a murder
trial, a big one,“ he said importantly. No kidding, Theo thought. “And,
well, murder trials attract some folks who might be security risks.“</p>
<p>“Like who?“</p>
<p>“Well, Theo, let me put it like this. In every murder there’s a
victim, and the victim has friends and family, and these people are,
naturally, not happy that their victim got murdered. Follow what I’m
saying?“</p>
<p>“Sure.“</p>
<p>“And you have a defendant. In this case it’s Mr. Duffy, who claims
he’s not guilty. They all say that, of course, but let’s assume he’s not
guilty. If that’s the case, then the real killer is still out there. He
might be curious about the trial.“ Deputy Gossett glanced around
suspiciously, as if the real killer could be close and might be
offended.</p>
<p>Theo almost asked: Why would the real killer be a security risk if he
showed up to watch the trial? What’s he gonna do? Kill somebody else? In
open court? In front of dozens of witnesses? “I see,“ Theo said. “You
guys better be careful.“</p>
<p>“We’ll have things under control.“</p>
<p>“I’ll see you in the morning.“</p>
<p>“You’ll be here?“</p>
<p>“Sure.“</p>
<p>Deputy Gossett was shaking his head. “I don’t think so, Theo. This
place will be packed. You won’t find a seat.“</p>
<p>“Oh, I talked to Judge Gantry this morning. He promised to save me
great seats.“ Theo was walking away. Deputy Gossett could not think of a
response.</p>
<p>Ike was Theo’s uncle, the older brother of Woods Boone. Before Theo
was born, Ike had started the firm of Boone &amp; Boone with Theo’s
parents. He had been a tax lawyer, one of the few in town. According to
the scant information Theo could get on the subject, the three lawyers
had enjoyed a pleasant and productive relationship until Ike did
something wrong. Bad wrong. So wrong that he was stripped of his license
to practice law. On several occasions Theo had asked his parents what,
exactly, Ike did wrong, but his parents refused to give the details.
They said they didn’t want to talk about it. Or, that they would explain
things when Theo was old enough to understand.</p>
<p>Ike was still doing tax work, but of a lesser variety. He was not a
lawyer and not an accountant. But since he had to do something for a
living, he prepared tax returns for working people and small businesses.
His office was on the second floor of an old building downtown. A Greek
couple ran a deli on the first floor. Ike did their tax work and was
paid in part with a free lunch five days a week.</p>
<p>His wife divorced him after he was disbarred. He was lonely and
generally unpleasant, and Theo did not always enjoy stopping by every
Monday afternoon. But Ike was family and that mattered, according to
Theo’s parents, though they spent almost no time with him.</p>
<p>“Hello, Theo,“ Ike called out as Theo opened the door to a long,
cluttered room and stepped inside.</p>
<p>“Hello, Ike.“ Though he was older than Theo’s father, he insisted on
being called Ike. Like Elsa, it was part of his effort to stay young. He
wore faded jeans, sandals, a T-shirt that advertised beer, and various
beaded bracelets on his left wrist. His hair was long, wild, white, and
gathered in the back in a ponytail.</p>
<p>Ike was at his desk, a wide table stacked with files. The Grateful
Dead played softly on a stereo. Cheap funky art covered the walls.
According to Mrs. Boone, Ike had been the typical dark-suited,
buttoned-up corporate tax man before he got into trouble. Now he fancied
himself as an old hippie, anti everything. A real rebel. “How’s my
favorite nephew?“ he asked as Theo settled into a chair across the desk.
“Great.“ Theo was the only nephew. “How was your day?“ Ike waved at the
debris littering his desk and said, “The usual. Just sorting out the
money problems of people with no money. How are things over at Boone and
Boone?“</p>
<p>“The same.“ Though he was only four blocks away, Ike seldom saw
Theo’s parents. They were somewhat friendly, but the past was
complicated.</p>
<p>“How’s school going?“</p>
<p>“Fine.“</p>
<p>“Straight A’s?“</p>
<p>“Yes. Maybe an A minus in Chemistry.“</p>
<p>“I expect straight A’s.“</p>
<p>You and everyone else, Theo thought. He wasn’t sure I how or why Ike
thought he was entitled to an opinion about Theo’s grades, but he
figured that’s what uncles were for. According to his parents, Ike was
brilliant and had finished college in just three years. “Your mother is
well?“</p>
<p>“Mom’s great, working hard.“ Ike never asked about Mr. Boone.</p>
<p>“I suppose you’re excited about the trial tomorrow.“</p>
<p>“Yes. My Government class is taking a field trip to the courtroom.
We’ll be there all day. Are you going?“ Theo asked, but he knew the
answer. Ike snorted in disgust. “Not me. I don’t voluntarily enter
courtrooms. Plus, I have too much work.“ A typical Boone. “I can’t
wait,“ Theo said.</p>
<p>“So you still want to be a lawyer, a great trial lawyer?“</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with that?“</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing, I guess.“ They had this same conversation every week.
Ike wanted Theo to be an architect or an artist, something creative.
“Most kids dream of being a policeman, or a fireman, or a great athlete
or actor. I’ve never seen one so taken with the idea of being a
lawyer.“</p>
<p>“Everybody’s gotta be something.“</p>
<p>“I suppose. This defense lawyer, Clifford Nance, is very good. You
ever seen him in action?“</p>
<p>“Not in a big trial. I’ve seen him in the courtroom arguing motions
and stuff, but not in a trial.“</p>
<p>“I knew Clifford well, at one point. Many years ago. I’ll bet he
wins.“</p>
<p>“You really think so?“</p>
<p>“Sure. The prosecution has a weak case, from what I hear.“ Though he
kept to himself, Ike had a knack for hearing the courthouse rumors.
Theo’s father suspected that Ike’s information came from his weekly
poker games with a group of retired lawyers. “There’s really no proof
that Mr. Duffy killed his wife,“ Ike said. “The prosecutor might be able
to establish a strong motive and arouse some suspicions, but nothing
else.“</p>
<p>“What’s the motive?“ Theo asked, though he thought he knew the
answer. He wanted to see how much Ike knew, or how much he was willing
to tell. “Money. A million dollars. Mr. Duffy bought a million dollar
life insurance policy on his wife two years ago. In the event of her
death, he gets a million dollars. His business was not doing well. He
needed some cash, so the theory is that he, literally, took matters into
his own hands.“</p>
<p>“He choked her?“ Theo had read every newspaper story about the murder
and knew the cause of death.</p>
<p>“That’s the theory. She died of strangulation. The prosecutor will
claim that Mr. Duffy choked her, then ransacked the house, took her
jewelry, tried to make it look as if she walked in on a burglar.“</p>
<p>“What will Mr. Nance try and prove?“</p>
<p>“He doesn’t have to prove anything, but he’ll argue that there’s no
proof, no evidence that Mr. Duffy was at the scene of the crime. To my
knowledge there are no witnesses who can place him there. It’s a very
tough case for the prosecution.“</p>
<p>“Do you think he’s guilty?“</p>
<p>Ike cracked at least eight knuckles and locked his hands behind his
head. He thought for a moment, then said, “Probably. I’ll bet Duffy
planned it all very carefully, and that it went down exactly as he
wanted it to. Those people do some strange things out there.“</p>
<p>“Those people“ were the residents of Waverly Creek, a wealthy
community built around a twenty-seven-hole golf course and protected by
gates. They were the newer residents, as opposed to the more established
ones who lived in the town proper and considered themselves the real
citizens of Strattenburg. The phrase “They live out at The Creek“ was
heard often and usually described people who added little to the
community and were much too concerned with money. The divide made little
sense to Theo. He had friends who lived out there. His parents had
clients from Waverly Creek. It was only two miles east of the city, but
it was often treated as if it belonged on another planet.</p>
<p>Mrs. Boone said that people in small towns spend too much time
looking up to or down on others. She had lectured Theo since he was a
small boy on the evils of judging people. The conversation drifted to
baseball, and, of course, the Yankees. Ike was a rabid Yankees fan and
loved to spout statistics on all his favorite players. Though it was
April, he was already predicting another World Series win. Theo argued
as usual, but as a Twins fan he had little ammunition. After thirty
minutes, he left with the promise to stop by next week.</p>
<p>“Get that Chemistry grade up,“ Ike said sternly.</p>
