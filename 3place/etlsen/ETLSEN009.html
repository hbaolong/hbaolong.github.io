<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>At 10:00 p.m., the Boones were at home in front of the television.
Judge was asleep on the sofa, his head in Theo’s lap. The Duffy murder
was the only news in Strattenburg and the town’s two television stations
covered nothing else that evening. There was a video of Pete Duffy
walking into the courthouse, surrounded by lawyers and paralegals and
other men with dark suits and somber faces. Another video, this one shot
from the air, showed the Duffy home on the sixth fairway at Waverly
Creek. A reporter outside the courthouse gave a rapid-fire account of
the testimony so far. Judge Gantry had a gag order in place; thus, none
of the lawyers or police or other witnesses could share their thoughts
or opinions.</p>
<p>Judge Gantry also banned cameras from his courtroom. The news crews
were kept out.</p>
<p>Theo had talked of nothing else, and his parents shared his suspicion
that Pete Duffy was guilty. Proving it, though, looked difficult. During
a commercial break, Theo began coughing. When this did not get the
attention of his parents, he coughed some more, then said, “My throat is
getting sore.“</p>
<p>“You look sort of pale,“ his father said. “You must be getting
sick.“</p>
<p>“I don’t feel well.“</p>
<p>“Are your eyes red?“ his father asked.</p>
<p>“I think so.“</p>
<p>“A headache?“</p>
<p>“Yes, but not bad.“</p>
<p>“Sniffles, runny nose?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“When did this happen?“ his mother asked.</p>
<p>“You’re a very sick boy,“ his father said. “I say you should skip
school tomorrow so you won’t spread this terrible infection. But, it
might be a good idea to go to court instead and watch the Duffy trial.
What do you think, Mom?“</p>
<p>“Oh, I see,“ she said. “A sudden onset of the flu.“</p>
<p>“Probably just another one of those nasty twenty-four hour episodes
that seems to end miraculously when the school day is over,“ his father
said. “I really don’t feel well,“ Theo said, busted but gamely trying to
hang on.</p>
<p>“Take an aspirin, maybe a cough drop,“ his father said. Woods Boone
seldom saw a doctor and believed most people spent far too much money on
medications. “Can you cough again for us, Teddy?“ his mother asked. As a
mother, she was slightly more sympathetic when he felt bad. The truth
was that Theo had a history of faking it, especially when he had
something better to do than go to school. His father started laughing.
“Yes, it was a pretty lame cough, Theo, even by your standards.“</p>
<p>“I could be dying,“ Theo said, trying not to laugh.</p>
<p>“Yes, but you’re not,“ his father said. “And if you show up in the
courtroom tomorrow Judge Gantry will have you arrested as a truant.“</p>
<p>“You know any good lawyers?“ Theo shot back. His mother burst out
laughing, and, eventually, Woods saw the humor. “Go to bed,“ he
said.</p>
<p>Theo limped up the stairs, thoroughly defeated, with Judge trailing
behind. In bed, he opened his laptop and checked on April. He was
relieved when she answered,</p>
<p>APRILNPARIS: Hi, Theo. How are you?</p>
<p>TBOONEESQ: Okay. Where are you?</p>
<p>APRILNPARIS: At home, in my bedroom, with my door locked.</p>
<p>TBOONEESQ: Where’s your mother?</p>
<p>APRILNPARIS: Downstairs. We’re not speaking.</p>
<p>TBOONEESQ: Did you make it to school?</p>
<p>APRILNPARIS: No, the trial lasted until noon. I’m so glad it’s
over.</p>
<p>TBOONEESQ: How was it on the witness stand?</p>
<p>APRILNPARIS: Terrible. I cried, Theo. I couldn’t stop crying. I told
the judge that I didn’t want to live with my mother or my father. Her
lawyer asked me questions. His lawyer asked me questions. It was
awful.</p>
<p>TBOONEESQ: I’m sorry.</p>
<p>APRILNPARIS: I don’t understand why you want to be a lawyer.</p>
<p>TBOONEESQ: To help people like you, that’s why. That’s what good
lawyers do. Did you like the judge?</p>
<p>APRILNPARIS: I didn’t like anybody.</p>
<p>TBOONEESQ: My mom says he’s good. Did he make a decision about your
custody?</p>
<p>APRILNPARIS: No. He said he would in a few days. For now, I’m living
with my mother and her lawyer thinks I’ll stay here.</p>
<p>TBOONEESQ: Probably so. Will you be at school tomorrow?</p>
<p>APRILNPARIS: Yep, and I haven’t touched my homework in a week.</p>
<p>TBOONEESQ: I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p>APRILNPARIS: Thanks, Theo.</p>
<p>An hour later he was still awake, his thoughts switching back and
forth, from April to the Duffy murder trial.</p>
<p>Julio was waiting. Theo slid to a stop at the bike rack near the
flagpole in front of the school and said, “Hola, Julio. Buenos
dias.“</p>
<p>“Hola, Theo.“</p>
<p>Theo wrapped the chain around the front tire and clicked the lock.
The chain still frustrated him. Up until a year earlier, bikes were safe
in Strattenburg. No one bothered with a chain. Then bikes began
disappearing, still were, and parents began insisting on the extra
security.</p>
<p>“Thanks for your help last night,“ Julio said. His English was good,
but still heavily accented. The fact that he had approached Theo at
school and initiated a conversation was a big step forward. Or so Theo
thought.</p>
<p>“No problem. Anytime.“</p>
<p>Julio glanced around. A crowd from the buses was moving through the
front door. “You know the law, right, Theo?“</p>
<p>“Both my parents are lawyers.“</p>
<p>“Police, courts, all that?“</p>
<p>Theo shrugged. He never denied that he possessed a sizable knowledge
of the law. “I understand a lot of it,“ he said. “What’s up?“</p>
<p>“This big trial, is it Mr. Duffy?“</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s on trial for murder. And it is a big trial.“</p>
<p>“Can we talk about it?“</p>
<p>“Sure,“ Theo said. “May I ask why?“</p>
<p>“ Maybe I know something.“</p>
<p>Theo studied his eyes. Julio looked away, as if he’d done something
wrong. An assistant principal yelled at some students to stop mingling
and get inside. Theo and Julio headed for the door. “I’ll find you
during lunch,“ Theo said. “Good. Thanks.“</p>
<p>“ No problem.“</p>
<p>As if Theo didn’t have enough of the Duffy trial on his mind, now he
had even more. A lot more. What could a homeless twelve-year-old from El
Salvador possibly know about the murder of Myra Duffy?</p>
<p>Nothing, Theo decided as he walked to homeroom. He said good morning
to Mr. Mount as he unpacked his backpack. He was not happy. The trial,
the biggest trial in the history of Strattenburg, would start again in
half an hour, and he would not be there. There is no justice, he
decided.</p>
<p>During the morning recess, Theo sneaked away to the library and hid
in a study carrel. He pulled out his laptop and went to work.</p>
<p>The court reporter assigned to the Duffy trial was a Ms. Finney. She
was the best in town, according to what Theo had heard around the
courthouse. As in every trial, Ms. Finney sat at the foot of the bench,
below the judge and next to the witness chair. It was the best seat in
the house, and rightfully so. Her job was to record every word spoken by
the judge, the lawyers, the witnesses, and, finally, the jury. Using her
stenograph machine, Ms. Finney could easily take down 250 words a
minute.</p>
<p>In the old days, according to Mrs. Boone, the court reporters used
shorthand, a method of recording that included symbols and codes and
abbreviations and pretty much anything else they needed to keep up with
the dialogue. After the trial, the court reporter would translate the
shorthand to a typed, neat transcript of what was said during the trial.
This would take days, even weeks, sometimes months, and was hard
work.</p>
<p>But now, thanks to technology, the recording was far easier. And,
better still, it produced an instant record of the trial. There were at
least four desktop computers in the courtroom–one on the bench for Judge
Gantry, one on the defense table, one for the prosecutor, and one for
the court clerk. As Ms. Finney captured every word, the text was
translated, formatted, and zipped into the system so that the four
computers ran the proceedings in real time.</p>
<p>Often, in a trial, there is a dispute over what a witness said or did
not say. Years earlier, the judge would be forced to call time-out while
the poor court reporter scurried through her notepads, found her
shorthand scribblings, and recounted what she’d written. Now, though,
the record was instant and far more reliable.</p>
<p>Ms. Finney shared an office on the third floor with several other
court reporters. Their software system was called Veritas. Theo had
hacked into it before when he’d been curious about something that
happened in court.</p>
<p>It was not a secure system because the information was available in
open court. Anyone could walk into the courtroom and watch the trial.
Anyone, of course, who was not confined by the rigors of middle school.
Even though Theo couldn’t be there in person, he certainly planned to
know what was happening.</p>
<p>He hadn’t missed much. The first witness of the second day was a
security chief who worked the front gate at Waverly Creek. There were
only two gates–the front and the south. Both had gatehouses that were
staffed by at least one armed and uniformed guard around the clock. Both
had multiple surveillance cameras. Using video records, the security
chief testified that Mr. Duffy, or at least Mr. Duffy’s car, had left
through the front gate at 6:48 a.m. on the day of the murder, and had
returned at 10:22 a.m.</p>
<p>The records proved that Mr. Duffy’s car was at home when his wife was
murdered. This meant nothing since it had already been admitted. He went
to work, came home, parked his car, got in his golf cart, and drove
away, leaving his wife behind, still alive.</p>
<p>Big deal, thought Theo. He checked the time. Only five minutes left
in recess.</p>
<p>The prosecution was going through a tedious summary of describing
each vehicle that had entered Waverly Creek that morning. There was a
plumbing truck and crew that went to one home. A flooring crew to
another. And so on. It appeared, at least to Theo, that the prosecution
was trying to account for every nonresident who might have gone past the
gates.</p>
<p>And to prove what? Maybe Jack Hogan would try to prove that there
were no unauthorized vehicles, or people, in Waverly Creek at the time
of the murder. This seemed a stretch to Theo.</p>
<p>He realized he was missing a dull part of the trial. He turned off
his laptop and hustled to class.</p>
<p>Julio was not in the cafeteria. Theo ate in a hurry, then went to
look for him. His curiosity was nagging him, and the longer he sat
through class, the more he wanted to know what Julio might know. He
checked with some seventh graders. No one knew where Julio was.</p>
<p>Theo returned to the library, to the same study carrel, and quickly
hacked into Ms. Finney’s software. The trial was in recess for lunch, as
Theo expected. Otherwise, he would have found some excuse to dart
downtown during the noon break and check out the action.</p>
<p>As expected, the prosecution had attempted to prove that there were
no unauthorized vehicles in Waverly Creek at the time of the murder.
Therefore, to follow Jack Hogan’s theory, the killer was not someone who
had entered without permission. Any stranger would have been noticed by
the elaborate security. The killer, then, had to be someone who could
easily come and go without drawing attention from the guards. Someone
who lived there. Someone like Pete Duffy.</p>
<p>This effort by the prosecution drew heavy fire from Mr. Clifford
Nance, who had kept quiet during the early hours of the trial. During a
heated and sometimes harsh cross- examination, Mr. Nance forced the
security chief to admit that there were (1) 154 single-family homes and
80 condos in Waverly Creek; and (2) at least 477 vehicles owned by the
residents there; and (3) an asphalt service road that was not watched by
either guards or cameras; and (4) at least two gravel roads that
provided access to the area and were not on the map.</p>
<p>Mr. Nance drove home the point that Waverly Creek covered some twelve
hundred acres, with lots of streams, creeks, ponds, woods, coves,
streets, alleys, homes, condos, three golf courses, and, well, it was
“impossible“ to secure all that.</p>
<p>The chief reluctantly agreed.</p>
<p>Later, he admitted that it was impossible to know who was present
inside the gated community at the time of the murder and who wasn’t.</p>
<p>Theo thought the cross-examination was brilliant, and very effective.
It made him sadder that he had missed it. “What are you doing?“ The
voice startled Theo and snapped him back into the world of middle
school. It was April. She knew his hiding places. “Checking on the
trial.“</p>
<p>“I hope I never see another trial.“</p>
<p>He closed his laptop, and they moved to a small table near the
periodicals. She wanted to talk, and in a near whisper she replayed the
nightmare of testifying in court with a bunch of frowning adults hanging
on every word.</p>
<p>Final bell was at three thirty, and twenty minutes later Theo was in
the courtroom. It wasn’t as crowded as it had been the day before.
Luckily, he found a spot next to Jenny, his true love from the Family
Court clerk’s office. But she patted his knee, as if he were just a cute
little puppy. This always irritated Theo. The jury was out. Judge Gantry
was gone. The trial was in some sort of recess. “What’s going on?“ he
whispered. “The lawyers are haggling in chambers,“ she whispered back,
frowning with frustration.</p>
<p>“You still think he’s guilty?“ His voice was even lower.</p>
<p>“Yes. You?“</p>
<p>“Don’t know.“</p>
<p>They whispered back and forth for a few minutes, then there was a
flurry of movement up front. Judge Gantry was back. The lawyers were
filing into the room. A bailiff went to fetch the jury.</p>
<p>The next witness for the prosecution was a banker. Jack Hogan started
with a series of questions about loans made to Pete Duffy. There was a
lot of talk about finances and collateral and defaults, and much of it
was over Theo’s head. As he watched the jurors, he realized that most of
them were not following too well either. The testimony quickly became
dull and boring. If it was intended to prove that Pete Duffy was broke
and needed cash, then Theo thought the banker was a lousy witness.</p>
<p>It was a bad day for the prosecution, at least in his opinion. He
glanced around the courtroom and realized that the sinister Omar Cheepe
was not present. Theo figured he was close by, somewhere, watching or
listening.</p>
<p>The banker was in the process of putting everyone to sleep. Theo
glanced up and back at the balcony, which was empty except for one
person. Julio was there. He was at the far end of the front row, bent at
the waist, his head barely visible over the railing, as if he knew he
wasn’t supposed to be there.</p>
<p>Theo turned back around, looked at the witness and the jury, and
asked himself why Julio would possibly be watching the trial. He knew
something. A few minutes later, Theo glanced up again. Julio was not
alone anymore. Omar Cheepe was sitting directly behind him, and Julio
did not know he was being observed.</p>
