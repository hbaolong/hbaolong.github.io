<h4 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h4>
<p>Halfway through Geometry, with Miss Garman still dropping hints about
a quiz, and with Theo staring at the wall and trying to stay awake, the
intercom above the door squawked and startled the class.</p>
<p>“Miss Garman, is Theo Boone in class?“ It was the shrieking voice of
Miss Gloria, the school’s longtime secretary.</p>
<p>“He is,“ Miss Garman responded. “Please send him down. He needs to
check out.“ Theo grabbed his things, stuffed them into his backpack, and
as he was hustling toward the door Miss Garman said, “If we have a quiz,
Theo, you can make it up on Monday.“</p>
<p>Well, thanks for nothing, Theo thought, but instead he said, “Can’t
wait.“</p>
<p>“Have a nice weekend, Theo,“ she said.</p>
<p>“You too.“</p>
<p>He was in the hall before he took a breath and wondered who was
checking him out, and for what reason. Maybe his mother had grown
concerned about his red eyes and tired face and she had decided to take
him to the doctor. Probably not. She was not one to overreact, and as a
general rule she did not call the doctor until Theo was half dead. Maybe
his father was having second thoughts and had decided to allow Theo to
watch the last day of the trial. Probably not. Woods Boone was, as
always, in another world.</p>
<p>Maybe it was something far worse. Some way, somehow, somebody had
snitched on him and the police were waiting with a search warrant to
find the gloves. The secrets would come out and he, Theo Boone, would
find himself in serious trouble.</p>
<p>He slowed his pace. Where the hallway turned, he peeked through a
large window and caught a glimpse of the front of the school. No police
cars. Nothing to indicate trouble. He kept walking, even slower.</p>
<p>Ike was waiting. He was chatting with Miss Gloria when Theo entered
the front office.</p>
<p>“This man says he’s your uncle,“ Miss Gloria said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid so,“ Theo said.</p>
<p>“And you have to go to a funeral over in Weeksburg?“</p>
<p>Ike was saying Come on, Come on with his eyes. Theo hesitated just
for a second, then nodded and said, “I hate funerals.“</p>
<p>“And you won’t be coming back?“ she said, reaching for a
clipboard.</p>
<p>“No, the funeral is at one thirty,“ Ike said. “It’ll kill the
day.“</p>
<p>“Sign here,“ she said.</p>
<p>Theo signed and they left the office. Ike’s car was a Triumph
Spitfire, a two-seater, at least thirty years old and far less than
perfectly maintained. Like everything else in Ike’s life, it was barely
hanging together and lucky to be running.</p>
<p>They were a block from the school before Theo spoke. “A funeral, huh?
I like it.“</p>
<p>“It worked.“</p>
<p>“And where are we going?“</p>
<p>“You’ve come to me for help. My advice is that we go to the offices
of Boone and Boone, get your parents in a room, and tell them
everything.“</p>
<p>Theo took a deep breath. He couldn’t argue. The issues involved were
too complicated for him.</p>
<p>They surprised Elsa when they barged in the front door. She jumped to
her feet and said, “Is something wrong?“</p>
<p>“Good morning, Elsa,“ Ike said. “You look exotic as always.“ She was
wearing an orange sweater the color of a pumpkin with matching glasses
and lipstick.</p>
<p>She ignored Ike, looked at Theo, and said, “What are you doing
here?“</p>
<p>“I’m here for the funeral,“ Theo said, and began walking toward the
library.</p>
<p>“Could you please round up Woods and Marcella?“ Ike said. “We need to
have a family meeting in the library.“</p>
<p>Normally Elsa would have balked at being told what to do, but she
knew this was serious. Luckily, Mrs. Boone was in her office, alone, and
Mr. Boone was upstairs shoving paper around his desk. They hurried into
the library, one after the other, and as soon as Ike closed the door
Mrs. Boone looked at Theo and said, “Are you okay?“ Mr. Boone looked at
Theo and said, “What’s going on here? Why aren’t you in school?“</p>
<p>“Relax,“ Ike said. “Let’s all have a seat and discuss matters.“ They
sat down, both parents eyeing Theo as if he’d committed a crime.</p>
<p>“Now,“ Ike continued, “Let me go first, then I’ll shut up and Theo
can talk. On Wednesday, just two days ago, Theo had a chat with one of
his friends at school. This chat led to another chat, and in the course
of these conversations Theo came across some information that could have
a dramatic impact on the trial of Mr. Pete Duffy. In short, there’s a
witness out there, a witness no one knows about. Not the police, not the
prosecution, not the defense, no one, except for Theo and his friend.
Theo did not know what to do, so he came to me. I’m not sure what to do
either, so here we are.“</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell us?“ Mrs. Boone snapped.</p>
<p>“He’s telling you now,“ Ike snapped back.</p>
<p>“I was scared,“ Theo said. “Still am, and I promised this friend that
I would tell no one.“</p>
<p>“What does this witness know?“ asked Mr. Boone.</p>
<p>Theo looked at Ike and Ike looked at Theo. Go ahead, Ike said with
his eyes. Theo cleared his throat and looked at his mother. “Well, this
witness was in the woods near the Duffy home at the time of the murder.
He saw Mr. Duffy pull up in a golf cart, take off his shoes, put a golf
glove on his right hand, go inside the house, and come out a few minutes
later. It was at the time of the murder. He put his shoes on, stuck the
golf gloves in his bag, and sped away as if nothing happened.“</p>
<p>“How do you know it was at the time of the murder?“ Mrs. Boone
asked.</p>
<p>“The pathologist testified that she died around eleven forty-five.
The witness was on his lunch break, and it started at eleven
thirty.“</p>
<p>“And Mr. Duffy never saw this witness?“ asked Mr. Boone.</p>
<p>“No. The man was hiding in the woods eating his lunch. He works at
the golf course.“</p>
<p>“Do you know his name?“ Mrs. Boone asked.</p>
<p>“No, but I know who he is.“</p>
<p>“Have you talked to him?“ asked Mr. Boone.</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Where did you talk to him?“ asked Mrs. Boone.</p>
<p>Theo felt like a trial witness suffering through a hot
cross-examination. He hesitated, and Ike jumped back in. “He’d rather
not divulge the names of the witness or the friend, and if you ask too
many questions, then their identities might become obvious.“</p>
<p>“I promised,“ Theo said, pleading. “In fact, I promised not to say a
word to anyone. I don’t know what to do.“</p>
<p>“So he came to me first,“ Ike said. “For advice. He didn’t want to
trouble you, but now there’s more to the story. Right, Theo?“</p>
<p>Both parents glared at him. Theo squirmed in his chair. He tapped his
fingers on the long oak table.</p>
<p>“Go ahead, Theo,“ Ike said.</p>
<p>“Let’s have it,“ Mr. Boone said.</p>
<p>Theo told them about the gloves.</p>
<p>“And you have them in your possession?“ Mrs. Boone asked when he
finished.</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Where are they now?“</p>
<p>“Downstairs, hidden behind a box of old divorce files.“</p>
<p>“ Downstairs, here? In our office?“</p>
<p>“Yes, Mom. Here. Below us.“</p>
<p>Mr. Boone whistled and said, “Oh boy.“</p>
<p>There was a long silence as the four Boones pondered the situation
and tried to sort out which laws and which procedures might apply to
this unusual set of facts. Though he’d said more than he planned to,
Theo was relieved that his burden had now been shared. His parents would
know what to do. Ike would offer some advice. Surely the three adults
could figure this out.</p>
<p>“The paper said the trial might be over today,“ Mrs. Boone said.</p>
<p>“I just left the courtroom,“ Ike said. “Mr. Duffy is expected to
testify this afternoon, and he’s the last witness. After closing
arguments, the jury will get the case.“</p>
<p>“The gossip at the cafe this morning was that Judge Gantry will hold
court tomorrow and wait for the jury,“ Mr. Boone said.</p>
<p>“On Saturday?“</p>
<p>“That was the gossip.“</p>
<p>There was another long gap in the conversation. Mrs. Boone looked at
her son and said, “Well, Theo, what do you suggest we do at this
point?“</p>
<p>Theo was hoping the adults would know what to do. He squirmed a
little, then said, “It seems to me that the best thing to do is to tell
Judge Gantry the whole story.“</p>
<p>“I agree,“ she said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Me too,“ said Ike.</p>
<p>It was no surprise, at least to Theo, that his father did not agree.
“But what if we tell Judge Gantry,“ Mr. Boone said, “and he presses Theo
for the name or identity of this witness? And Theo refuses to cough up
the name? Then what? It could be that Judge Gantry holds him in
contempt.“</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what that means,“ Theo blurted.</p>
<p>“It means trouble,“ his father said.</p>
<p>“It means he could throw you in jail until you give him what he
wants,“ Ike said with a nasty grin, as if he thought this was
humorous.</p>
<p>“I’d rather not go to jail,“ Theo said.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous, Woods,“ Mrs. Boone said. “Henry Gantry would
not hold Theo in contempt.“</p>
<p>“I’m not so sure about that,“ Woods fired back. “You have a crucial
eyewitness whose testimony could potentially change the outcome of the
trial, and you have one person who knows about this eyewitness. That
person is Theo, and if he refuses to obey the judge, then the judge
might get upset. I wouldn’t blame him.“</p>
<p>“I really don’t want to go to jail,“ Theo said.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to jail,“ Mrs. Boone said. “No judge in his right
mind would lock up an innocent thirteen-year old.“</p>
<p>Another long pause.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Boone said, “Theo, what would happen if the identity of
this witness were somehow revealed?“</p>
<p>“He’s an illegal immigrant, Dad. He’s not supposed to be here, and
he’s scared. If the police know his name and find him, then he’s in jail
and it’s all my fault. If they don’t catch him, then he’ll
disappear.“</p>
<p>“Then don’t tell us who he is,“ Mrs. Boone said.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mom. I wasn’t planning on it.“</p>
<p>“Don’t tell anyone.“</p>
<p>“Got it. But now you know he’s an illegal immigrant and he works at
the golf course. He wouldn’t be hard to find.“</p>
<p>“And how did you get to know this person?“ Mr. Boone asked.</p>
<p>“He has a cousin at school, and this cousin came to me for help.“</p>
<p>“Like all the other kids at school,“ Ike said.</p>
<p>“Not all, but most of them.“</p>
<p>Everyone took a deep breath, then Mr. Boone looked at Theo and
smiled. “It’s the family from the shelter, isn’t it? Julio, your friend,
the kid you tutor in math? And his mother, what’s her name?“</p>
<p>“Carola,“ Theo’s mother answered.</p>
<p>“Carola, right. I’ve spoken to her several times. She has two smaller
kids, and Julio. They’re from El Salvador. Julio’s cousin is the
mysterious eyewitness. Right, Theo?“</p>
<p>Theo nodded. Yes, Dad, you figured it out. And in an odd way he was
relieved. He didn’t actually betray a confidence, and someone had to
know the truth.</p>
<p>It occurred to Theo, as he walked behind his parents and Ike, that
this was perhaps the first time he’d entered the courthouse with some
reluctance. He was always excited to be there, to see the clerks and
lawyers hustle about with their important matters, to take in the large,
open marble foyer with an old chandelier hanging from above and massive
portraits of dead judges on the walls. He’d always loved the courthouse,
but such feelings of fondness were absent now. Theo was afraid of what
was about to happen, though he had no idea what it might be.</p>
<p>They marched upstairs to the second floor, to the closed and guarded
door of the main courtroom. A bailiff named Snodgrass informed them that
the trial was in session and the door would not be opened until a
recess. So they marched down the hall to the office of the Honorable
Henry L. Gantry, where his secretary, Mrs. Irma Hardy, was typing away
when they entered.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Irma,“ Mrs. Boone said.</p>
<p>“Well, good morning, Marcella, and Woods, and, well, hello, Theo.“
Mrs. Hardy was standing and removing her glasses and obviously uncertain
as to why the entire Boone family had suddenly appeared at her desk. She
looked suspiciously at Ike, as if their paths had crossed long ago under
circumstances that had been less than ideal. Ike was wearing jeans,
white sneakers, and a T-shirt, but thankfully, he’d put on an old brown
blazer and it gave him some measure of credibility.</p>
<p>“Ike Boone,“ he said, thrusting out a hand. “Brother of Woods, uncle
of Theo. Used to be a lawyer around here.“</p>
<p>Mrs. Hardy managed a fake smile as if she remembered the name and
shook his hand.</p>
<p>Mrs. Boone said, “Look, Irma, we have an urgent matter to discuss
with Judge Gantry. I know he’s on the bench right now, the Duffy trial,
and, well, that’s why we’re here. I’m afraid it’s crucial that we speak
with him.“</p>
<p>Mr. Boone barged in, “What time will he break for lunch?“</p>
<p>“Usually around noon, same as always, but he’ll meet with all the
lawyers during lunch,“ Mrs. Hardy said, glancing at each of the four
faces staring at her. “He’s extremely busy, you know.“</p>
<p>Theo looked at the large clock on the wall behind her. It was ten
minutes after eleven.</p>
<p>“It’s imperative that we see the judge as soon as possible,“
Mrs. Boone said, a bit too pushy in Theo’s opinion. But then, she was a
divorce lawyer and she was not known to be timid.</p>
<p>But this was Mrs. Hardy’s turf and she was not one to be pushed
around. “Well, it might be helpful if you tell me what’s up,“ she
said.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it’s confidential,“ Mr. Boone said with a frown.</p>
<p>“We simply can’t do that, Irma, I’m sorry,“ Mrs. Boone added.</p>
<p>There were some chairs across the room, under yet more portraits of
dead judges. Mrs. Hardy waved at them and said, “You may wait here. I’ll
inform the judge as soon as he breaks for lunch.“</p>
<p>“Thank you, Irma,“ Mrs. Boone said.</p>
<p>“Thanks,“ Mr. Boone said.</p>
<p>Everyone took a breath, and smiled, and the Boones retreated.</p>
<p>“Theo, why aren’t you in school?“ Mrs. Hardy asked.</p>
<p>“It’s a very long story,“ he said. “I’ll tell you one day.“</p>
<p>The four Boones sat down, and within fifteen seconds Ike was leaving,
mumbling about going for a smoke. Mrs. Boone was on her cell phone,
checking on some pressing matter with Elsa back at the office. Mr. Boone
was poring over a document from a file he’d brought.</p>
<p>Theo remembered Woody and the arrest of his brother. He opened his
backpack, removed his laptop, and began searching the Criminal Court
dockets and arrest records. Such information was not available to the
public online, but Theo, as always, used the Boone law firm’s access
code to find whatever he needed.</p>
<p>Woody’s brother, Tony, was being held in the Strattenburg Juvenile
Detention Center, the fancy name for the jail where they locked up those
under the age of eighteen. Tony was charged with possession of marijuana
with intent to sell, a crime that carried a maximum sentence of ten
years in prison. Because he was seventeen, a minor, he could probably
work a deal that would allow him to plead guilty and serve two years in
another youth facility. Assuming, of course, he agreed to plead guilty.
If he wanted to plead not guilty, then he would face a jury and run the
risk of a much longer sentence. Juveniles charged with drug violations
went to trial in less than 2 percent of the cases.</p>
<p>If the parents and stepparents refused to help, as Woody had said,
then his brother would be assigned to a public defender. In
Strattenburg, the public defenders were very good and handled similar
drug cases every day.</p>
<p>Theo quickly summarized this in an e-mail and zipped it to Woody. He
sent another e-mail to Mr. Mount and explained that he was not at school
and would miss Government. He sent a quick Hello to April.</p>
<p>The clock on the wall seemed to freeze. Mrs. Hardy was busy with her
typing. All the dead judges seemed to stare down at Theo, none of them
smiling, all somber-faced and suspicious, as if to say, “Son, what are
you doing here?“ His father was out in the hall, on the phone, dealing
with some crucial real estate matter. His mother was on her laptop,
pecking away as if lives were at stake. Ike was still by a window
somewhere, blowing smoke out of the building.</p>
<p>Theo wandered off. He climbed the stairs and stopped by the Family
Court office where he hoped to find Jenny, but she was not there. He
drifted down to Animal Court, but the room was empty. Then he climbed an
old, dark stairwell, the one no one used and few people even knew about,
and silently made his way through a dimly lit hallway on the third floor
until he came to an abandoned room that had once housed the county law
library. It was used for storage and packed with boxes of old land
records and outdated computers. A thick layer of dust covered
everything, and Theo left footprints on the floor as he tiptoed through
the rubble. He opened the door to a small closet, then closed the door
behind him. The space was so dark he could not see his hands. Near the
floor was a crack, a sliver of an opening, and through it Theo could see
the courtroom below. His view was from high above, over the heads of the
jurors.</p>
<p>It was a splendid view, one that Theo had discovered himself a year
earlier when a crime victim testified in a case so horrible that Judge
Gantry cleared the courtroom. Her testimony made Theo ill and he’d
wished a thousand times that he had not spied on the trial. From inside
the courtroom, the crack in the paneling could not be seen. It was just
above a row of thick velvet curtains above the jury box.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Duffy’s golfing buddies was on the witness stand, and
though Theo could not hear well he got the gist of the testimony. The
witness was explaining that Mr. Duffy was a serious golfer, who, for
several years now, had often played alone. This was not unusual. Many
golfers, especially the more serious ones, like to work on their game by
playing alone.</p>
<p>The courtroom was packed. Theo could not see the balcony, but he
guessed it was crowded, too. He had a clear shot at Mr. Duffy, who sat
among his lawyers at the defense table. He looked confident, almost
certain that the trial was playing out in his favor and that the jury
would find him not guilty.</p>
<p>Theo watched for a few minutes, then the lawyers started yelling and
he slipped out of the closet. He was halfway down the stairwell when he
saw something move on the landing below. Someone was down there, in the
shadows, hiding. Theo froze and got a whiff of something burning. The
man was smoking a cigarette, which was against the rules because they
were still inside the building. He blew a huge cloud, then stepped onto
the landing. It was Omar Cheepe, visible now with his massive slick head
and black eyes. He looked up at Theo, said nothing, then turned and
walked away.</p>
<p>Theo did not know if he’d been followed, or if the stairwell was one
