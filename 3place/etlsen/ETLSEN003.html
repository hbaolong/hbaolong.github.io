<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>
<p>Second period was Geometry with Miss Garman. It was followed by a
short break outdoors, then the class returned to homeroom, to Mr. Mount
and the best hour of the day, at least in Theo’s opinion. Mr. Mount was
in his midthirties, and had once worked as a lawyer at a gigantic firm
in a skyscraper in Chicago. His brother was a lawyer. His father and
grandfather had been lawyers and judges. Mr. Mount, though, had grown
weary of the long hours and high pressure, and, well, he’d quit. He’d
walked away from the big money and found something he found far more
rewarding. He loved teaching, and though he still thought of himself as
a lawyer, he considered the classroom far more important than the
courtroom.</p>
<p>Because he knew the law so well, his Government class spent most of
its time discussing cases, old ones and current ones and even fictitious
ones on television.</p>
<p>“All right, men,“ he began when they were seated and still. He always
addressed them as “men“ and for thirteen year-olds there was no greater
compliment. “Tomorrow I want you here at eight fifteen. We’ll take a bus
to the courthouse and we’ll be in our seats in plenty of time. It’s a
field trip, approved by the principal, so you will be excused from all
other classes. Bring lunch money and we’ll eat at Pappy’s Deli. Any
questions?“</p>
<p>The men were hanging on every word, excitement all over their
faces.</p>
<p>“What about backpacks?“ someone asked.</p>
<p>“No,“ Mr. Mount answered. “You can’t take anything into the
courtroom. Security will be tight. It is, after all, the first murder
trial here in a long time. Any more questions?“</p>
<p>“What should we wear?“</p>
<p>Slowly, all eyes turned to Theo, including those of Mr. Mount. It was
well known that Theo spent more time in the courthouse than most
lawyers.</p>
<p>“Coat and tie, Theo?“ Mr. Mount asked.</p>
<p>“No, not at all. What we’re wearing now is fine.“</p>
<p>“Great. Any more questions? Good. Now, I’ve asked Theo if he would
sort of set the stage for tomorrow. Lay out the courtroom, give us the
players, tell us what we’re in for. Theo.“</p>
<p>Theo’s laptop was already wired to the overhead projector. He walked
to the front of the class, pressed a key, and a large diagram appeared
on the digital wide-screen whiteboard. “This is the main courtroom,“
Theo said, in his best lawyer’s voice. He held a laser pointer with a
red light and sort of waved it around the diagram. “At the top, in the
center here, is the bench. That’s where the judge sits and controls the
trial. Not sure why it’s called a bench. It’s more like a throne. But,
anyway, we’ll stick with bench. The judge is Henry Gantry.“ He punched a
key, and a large formal photo of Judge Gantry appeared. Black robe,
somber face. Theo shrank it, then dragged it up to the bench. With the
judge in place, he continued, “Judge Gantry has been a judge for about
twenty years and handles only criminal cases. He runs a tight courtroom
and is well liked by most of the lawyers.“ The laser pointer moved to
the middle of the courtroom. “This is the defense table, where
Mr. Duffy, the man accused of murder, will be seated.“ Theo punched a
key and a black-and-white photo, one taken from a newspaper, appeared.
“This is Mr. Duffy. Age forty-nine, used to be married to Mrs. Duffy,
who is now deceased, and as we all know, Mr. Duffy is accused of
murdering her.“ He shrank the photo and moved it to the defense table.
“His lawyer is Clifford Nance, probably the top criminal defense lawyer
in this part of the state.“ Nance appeared in color, wearing a dark suit
and a shifty smile. He had long, curly gray hair. His photo was reduced
and placed next to his client’s. “Next to the defense table is the
prosecution’s table. The lead prosecutor is Jack Hogan, who’s also known
as the district attorney, or DA.“ Hogan’s photo appeared for a few
seconds before it was reduced and placed at the table next to the
defense.</p>
<p>“Where’d you find these photos?“ someone asked.</p>
<p>“Each year the bar association publishes a directory of all the
lawyers and judges,“ Theo answered.</p>
<p>“Are you included?“ This brought a few light laughs.</p>
<p>“No. Now, there will be other lawyers and paralegals at both tables,
prosecution and defense. This area is usually crowded. Over here, next
to the defense, is the jury box. It has fourteen chairs–twelve for the
jurors and two for the alternates. Most states still use twelve-man
juries, though different sizes are not unusual. Regardless of the
number, the verdict has to be unanimous, at least in criminal cases.
They pick alternates in case one of the twelve gets sick or excused or
something. The jury was selected last week, so we won’t have to watch
that. It’s pretty boring.“ The laser pointer moved to a spot in front of
the bench. Theo continued, “The court reporter sits here. She’ll have a
machine that is called a stenograph. Sorta looks like a typewriter, but
much different. Her job is to record every word that’s said during the
trial. That might sound impossible, but she makes it look easy. Later,
she’ll prepare what’s known as a transcript so that the lawyers and the
judge will have a record of everything. Some transcripts have thousands
of pages.“ The laser pointer moved again. “Here, close to the court
reporter and just down from the judge, is the witness chair. Each
witness walks up here, is sworn to tell the truth, then takes a
seat.“</p>
<p>“Where do we sit?“</p>
<p>The laser pointer moved to the middle of the diagram. “This is called
the bar. Again, don’t ask why. The bar is a wooden railing that
separates the spectators from the trial area. There are ten rows of
seats with an aisle down the middle. This is usually more than enough
for the crowd, but this trial will be different.“ The laser pointer
moved to the rear of the courtroom. “Up here, above the last few rows,
is the balcony where there are three long benches. We’re in the balcony,
but don’t worry. We’ll be able to see and hear everything.“</p>
<p>“Any questions?“ Mr. Mount asked.</p>
<p>The boys gawked at the diagram. “Who goes first?“ someone asked.</p>
<p>Theo began pacing. “Well, the State has the burden of proving guilt,
so it must present its case first. First thing tomorrow morning, the
prosecutor will walk to the jury box and address the jurors. This is
called the opening statement. He’ll lay out his case. Then the defense
lawyer will do the same. After that, the State will start calling
witnesses. As you know, Mr. Duffy is presumed to be innocent, so the
State must prove him guilty, and it must do so beyond a reasonable
doubt. He claims he’s innocent, which actually in real life doesn’t
happen very often. About eighty percent of those indicted for murder
eventually plead guilty, because they are in fact guilty. The other
twenty percent go to trial, and ninety percent of those are found
guilty. So, it’s rare for a murder defendant to be found not
guilty.“</p>
<p>“My dad thinks he’s guilty,“ Brian said.</p>
<p>“A lot of people do,“ Theo said.</p>
<p>“How many trials have you watched, Theo?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Dozens.“</p>
<p>Since none of the other fifteen had ever seen the inside of a
courtroom, this was almost beyond belief. Theo continued: “For those of
you who watch a lot of television, don’t expect fireworks. A real trial
is very different, and not nearly as exciting. There are no surprise
witnesses, no dramatic confessions, no fistfights between the lawyers.
And, in this trial, there are no eyewitnesses to the murder. This means
that all of the evidence from the State will be circumstantial. You’ll
hear this word a lot, especially from Mr. Clifford Nance, the defense
lawyer. He’ll make a big deal out of the fact that the State has no
direct proof, that everything is circumstantial.“</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what that means,“ someone said. “It means that the
evidence is indirect, not direct. For example, did you ride your bike to
school?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“And did you chain it to the rack by the flagpole?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“So, when you leave school this afternoon, and you go to the rack,
and your bike is gone, and the chain has been cut, then you have
indirect evidence that someone stole your bike. No one saw the thief, so
there’s no direct evidence. And let’s say that tomorrow the police find
your bike in a pawnshop on Raleigh Street, a place known to deal in
stolen bikes. The owner gives the police a name, they investigate and
find some dude with a history of stealing bikes. You can then make a
strong case, through indirect evidence, that this guy is your thief. No
direct evidence, but circumstantial.“</p>
<p>Even Mr. Mount was nodding along. He was the faculty adviser for the
Eighth-Grade Debate Team, and, not surprisingly, Theodore Boone was his
star. He’d never had a student as quick on his feet.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Theo,“ Mr. Mount said. “And thank you for getting us the
seats in the morning.“</p>
<p>“Nothing to it,“ Theo said, and proudly took his seat.</p>
<p>It was a bright class in a strong public school. Justin was by far
the best athlete, though he couldn’t swim as fast as Brian. Ricardo beat
them all at golf and tennis. Edward played the cello, Woody the electric
guitar, Darren the drums, Jarvis the trumpet. Joey had the highest IQ
and made perfect grades. Chase was the mad scientist who was always a
threat to blow up the lab. Aaron spoke Spanish, from his mother’s side,
German from his father’s, and English, of course. Brandon had an early
morning paper route, traded stocks online, and planned to be the first
millionaire in the group. Naturally, there were two hopeless nerds and
at least one potential felon. The class even had its own lawyer, a first
for Mr. Mount.</p>
