<h4 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h4>
<p>Tuesday night meant dinner in a soup kitchen. It wasn’t the worst
meal of the week. That would be Sunday night, when his mother attempted
to roast a chicken. But it wasn’t a great meal either. The soup kitchen
was just called that. It really wasn’t a kitchen and they rarely served
soup. It was a large dining room in the basement of a converted church
where homeless people gathered to eat and spend the night. The food was
prepared by volunteers who usually offered sandwiches, chips, fruit,
cookies. “Stuff from a bag,“ Theo’s mother called it. Not all that
healthy.</p>
<p>Theo had heard that there were around three hundred homeless people
in Strattenburg. He saw them on Main Street, where they begged for money
and slept on benches. He saw them in garbage Dumpsters scrounging for
food. The city was alarmed at this number and by the lack of beds in
shelters. The city council seemed to argue about this problem every
week.</p>
<p>Mrs. Boone was alarmed, too. She had been so concerned about homeless
mothers that she started a program to assist victims of domestic
violence. Women who’d been beaten and threatened. Women who had no place
to live, no one to turn to. Women with children who needed help and
didn’t know where to find it. Mrs. Boone, along with several of the
other female lawyers in town, had started a small legal clinic to reach
out to these women.</p>
<p>And so every Tuesday night, the Boone family walked a few blocks from
their office downtown to the Highland Street Shelter, where they spent
three hours with the less fortunate. They took their turns serving
dinner to the hundred or so folks gathered there, then afterward they
had a quick bite.</p>
<p>Though he wasn’t supposed to know, Theo had overheard his parents
discussing whether they should increase their monthly donation to the
shelter from two hundred to three hundred dollars. His parents were far
from wealthy. His friends thought he was rich because both parents were
lawyers, but the truth was their work was not that profitable. They
lived modestly, saved for Theo’s education, and enjoyed being generous
with those of lesser means.</p>
<p>After dinner, Mr. Boone set up a makeshift office at the far end of
the dining room, and a few homeless people drifted that way. He would
help them with problems that usually ranged from being evicted from
their apartments to being denied food stamps or medical care. He often
said that these were his favorite clients. They couldn’t pay a fee, so
there was no pressure to collect from them. They were grateful for
whatever he tried to do. And, he genuinely enjoyed talking to them.</p>
<p>Because of the more sensitive nature of her work, Mrs. Boone saw her
clients in a small room upstairs. The first client had two small
children, no job, no money, and, if not for the shelter, no place to
sleep that night.</p>
<p>Theo’s task was to help with the homework. The shelter had several
families that were allowed to stay there for up to twelve months–that
was the limit at Highland Street. After a year, they had to move on.
Most of them found jobs and places to live, but it took time. While they
were in the shelter, they were treated like other residents of
Strattenburg. They were fed and clothed and treated for medical
problems. They were either employed or looking for work. They were
invited to churches for worship.</p>
<p>And their children attended the local schools. At night, in the
shelter, homework sessions were organized by volunteers from a church.
Theo’s job every Tuesday was to teach English to two second graders,
Hector and Rita, and to help their brother with algebra. They were from
El Salvador, and their father had disappeared under mysterious
circumstances, leaving them homeless. They were found by the police
living under a bridge with their mother.</p>
<p>As always, Hector and Rita were thrilled to see Theo and clung to him
as he stuffed down his sandwich. Then they scurried down the hall to a
large open room where other children were being tutored.</p>
<p>“No Spanish,“ he said repeatedly. “Only English.“</p>
<p>Their English was amazing. They were absorbing it daily at school and
teaching it to their mother. They found a corner table and Theo began
reading a picture book, something about a frog lost at sea.</p>
<p>Mrs. Boone had insisted that Theo start Spanish in the fourth grade,
as soon as it was offered. When the classes proved too easy, she hired a
private tutor who stopped by the office twice a week for rigorous
lessons. With his mother pushing him hard, and with Madame Monique
giving him daily inspiration, Theo was learning rapidly. He read a page,
then Rita reread it. Then Hector. Theo corrected their mistakes, then
moved on. The room was noisy, even rowdy, as two dozen or so students of
all ages plowed through their homework. The twins had an older brother,
Julio, a seventh grader Theo saw occasionally on the playground at
school. He was extremely shy, to the point of being awkward. Mrs. Boone
speculated that the poor kid was probably scarred from the trauma of
losing his father in a strange country with no one to turn to. She
always had a theory when someone acted strange. After Theo finished the
second book with Hector and Rita, Julio joined them and sat down at the
table. “What’s up?“ Theo said. Julio smiled and looked away.</p>
<p>“Let’s read another book,“ Hector said.</p>
<p>“In a minute.“</p>
<p>“I’m having trouble with algebra,“ Julio said. “Can you help?“</p>
<p>“He’s with us,“ Rita said to her brother, and appeared ready to
fight.</p>
<p>Theo picked out two books from a shelf and placed them before Hector
and Rita. Then he arranged two writing tablets and two pencils. “Read
these books,“ he said. “Say every word as you read it. When you see a
word you don’t know, write it down. Okay?“</p>
<p>They yanked the books open as if it were a contest.</p>
<p>Theo and Julio were soon lost in the world of pre algebra.</p>
