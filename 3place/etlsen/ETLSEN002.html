<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>
<p>Theodore Boone was an only child and for that reason usually had
breakfast alone. His father, a busy lawyer, was in the habit of leaving
early and meeting friends for coffee and gossip at the same downtown
diner every morning at seven. Theo’s mother, herself a busy lawyer, had
been trying to lose ten pounds for at least the past ten years, and
because of this she’d convinced herself that breakfast should be nothing
more than coffee with the newspaper. So he ate by himself at the kitchen
table, cold cereal and orange juice, with an eye on the clock. The Boone
home had clocks everywhere, clear evidence of organized people.</p>
<p>Actually, he wasn’t completely alone. Beside his chair, his dog ate,
too. Judge was a thoroughly mixed mutt whose age and breeding would
always be a mystery. Theo had rescued him from near death with a
last-second appearance in Animal Court two years earlier, and Judge
would always be grateful. He preferred Cheerios, same as Theo, and they
ate together in silence every morning. At 8:00 a.m., Theo rinsed their
bowls in the sink, placed the milk and juice back in the fridge, walked
to the den, and kissed his mother on the cheek. “Off to school,“ he
said. “Do you have lunch money?“ she asked, the same question five
mornings a week. “Always.“</p>
<p>“And your homework is complete?“</p>
<p>“It’s perfect, Mom.“</p>
<p>“And I’ll see you when?“</p>
<p>“I’ll stop by the office after school.“ Theo stopped by the office
every day after school, without fail, but Mrs. Boone always asked. “Be
careful,“ she said. “And remember to smile.“ The braces on his teeth had
now been in place for over two years and Theo wanted desperately to get
rid of them. In the meantime, though, his mother continually reminded
him to smile and make the world a happier place. “I’m smiling, Mom.“</p>
<p>“Love you, Teddy.“</p>
<p>“Love you back.“</p>
<p>Theo, still smiling in spite of being called “Teddy,“ flung his
backpack across his shoulders, scratched Judge on the head and said
good-bye, then left through the kitchen door. He hopped on his bike and
was soon speeding down Mallard Lane, a narrow leafy street in the oldest
section of town. He waved at Mr. Nunnery, who was already on his porch
and settled in for another long day of watching what little traffic
found its way into their neighborhood, and he whisked by Mrs. Goodloe at
the curb without speaking because she’d lost her hearing and most of her
mind as well. He did smile at her, though, but she did not return the
smile. Her teeth were somewhere in the house.</p>
<p>It was early spring and the air was crisp and cool. Theo pedaled
quickly, the wind stinging his face. Homeroom was at eight forty and he
had important matters before school. He cut through a side street,
darted down an alley, dodged some traffic, and ran a stop sign. This was
Theo’s turf, the route he traveled every day. After four blocks the
houses gave way to offices and shops and stores.</p>
<p>The county courthouse was the largest building in downtown
Strattenburg (the post office was second, the library third). It sat
majestically on the north side of Main Street, halfway between a bridge
over the river and a park filled with gazebos and birdbaths and
monuments to those killed in wars. Theo loved the courthouse, with its
air of authority, and people hustling importantly about, and somber
notices and schedules tacked to the bulletin boards. Most of all, Theo
loved the courtrooms themselves. There were small ones where more
private matters were handled without juries, then there was the main
courtroom on the second floor where lawyers battled like gladiators and
judges ruled like kings.</p>
<p>At the age of thirteen, Theo was still undecided about his future.
One day he dreamed of being a famous trial lawyer, one who handled the
biggest cases and never lost before juries. The next day he dreamed of
being a great judge, noted for his wisdom and fairness. He went back and
forth, changing his mind daily.</p>
<p>The main lobby was already busy on this Monday morning, as if the
lawyers and their clients wanted an early start to the week. There was a
crowd waiting by the elevator, so Theo raced up two flights of stairs
and down the east wing where Family Court was held. His mother was a
noted divorce lawyer, one who always represented the wife, and Theo knew
this area of the building well. Since divorce trials were decided by
judges, juries were not used, and since most judges preferred not to
have large groups of spectators observing such sensitive matters, the
courtroom was small. By its door, several lawyers huddled importantly,
obviously not agreeing on much. Theo searched the hallway, then turned a
corner and saw his friend.</p>
<p>She was sitting on one of the old wooden benches, alone, small and
frail and nervous. When she saw him she smiled and put a hand over her
mouth. Theo hustled over and sat next to her, very closely, knees
touching. With any other girl he would have placed himself at least two
feet away and prevented any chance of contact.</p>
<p>But April Finnemore was not just any girl. They had started
prekindergarten together at the age of four at a nearby church school,
and they had been close friends since they could remember. It wasn’t a
romance; they were too young for that. Theo did not know of a single
thirteen-year old boy in his class who admitted to having a girlfriend.
Just the opposite. They wanted nothing to do with them. And the girls
felt the same way. Theo had been warned that things would change, and
dramatically, but that seemed unlikely.</p>
<p>April was just a friend, and one in a great deal of need at the
moment. Her parents were divorcing, and Theo was extremely grateful his
mother was not involved with the case.</p>
<p>The divorce was no surprise to anyone who knew the Finnemores.
April’s father was an eccentric antiques dealer and the drummer for an
old rock band that still played in nightclubs and toured for weeks at a
time. Her mother raised goats and made goat cheese, which she peddled
around town in a converted funeral hearse, painted bright yellow. An
ancient spider monkey with gray whiskers rode shotgun and munched on the
cheese, which had never sold very well. Mr. Boone had once described the
family as “nontraditional,“ which Theo took to mean downright weird.
Both her parents had been arrested on drug charges, though neither had
served time.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?“ Theo asked.</p>
<p>“No,“ she said. “I hate being here.“</p>
<p>She had an older brother named August and an older sister named
March, and both fled the family. August left the day after he graduated
from high school. March dropped out at the age of sixteen and left town,
leaving April as the only child for her parents to torment. Theo knew
all of this because April told him everything. She had to. She needed
someone outside of her family to confide in, and Theo was her
listener.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to live with either one of them,“ she said. It was a
terrible thing to say about one’s parents, but Theo understood
completely. He despised her parents for the way they treated her. He
despised them for the chaos of their lives, for their neglect of April,
for their cruelty to her. Theo had a long list of grudges against
Mr. and Mrs. Finnemore. He would run away before being forced to live
there. He did not know of a single kid in town who’d ever set foot
inside the Finnemore home. The divorce trial was in its third day, and
April would soon be called to the witness stand to testify. The judge
would ask her the fateful question, “April, which parent do you want to
live with?“ And she did not know the answer. She had discussed it for
hours with Theo, and she still did not know what to say. The great
question in Theo’s mind was, “Why did either parent want custody of
April?“ Each had neglected her in so many ways. He had heard many
stories, but he had never repeated a single one. “What are you going to
say?“ he asked.</p>
<p>“I’m telling the judge that I want to live with my aunt Peg in
Denver.“</p>
<p>“I thought she said no.“</p>
<p>“She did.“</p>
<p>“Then you can’t say that.“</p>
<p>“What can I say, Theo?“</p>
<p>“My mother would say that you should choose your mother. I know she’s
not your first choice, but you don’t have a first choice.“ I “But the
judge can do whatever he wants, right?“</p>
<p>“Right. If you were fourteen, you could make a binding decision. At
thirteen, the judge will only consider your wishes. According to my
mother, this judge almost never awards custody to the father. Play it
safe. Go with your mother.“ April wore jeans, hiking boots, and a navy
sweater. She rarely dressed like a girl, but her gender was never in
doubt. She wiped a tear from her cheek, but managed to keep her
composure. “Thanks, Theo,“ she said. “I wish I could stay.“</p>
<p>“ And I wish I could go to school.“</p>
<p>They both managed a forced laugh. “I’ll be thinking about you. Be
strong.“</p>
<p>“Thanks, Theo.“</p>
<p>His favorite judge was the Honorable Henry Gantry, and he entered the
great man’s outer office at twenty minutes after 8:00 a.m. “Well, good
morning, Theo,“ Mrs. Hardy said. She was stirring something into her
coffee and preparing to begin her work. “Morning, Mrs. Hardy,“ Theo said
with a smile. “And to what do we owe this honor?“ she asked. She was not
quite as old as Theo’s mother, he guessed, and she was very pretty. She
was Theo’s favorite of all the secretaries in the courthouse. His
favorite clerk was Jenny over in Family Court. “I need to see Judge
Gantry,“ he replied. “Is he in?“</p>
<p>“Well, yes, but he’s very busy.“</p>
<p>“Please. It’ll just take a minute.“</p>
<p>She sipped her coffee, then asked, “Does this have anything to do
with the big trial tomorrow?“</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am, it does. I’d like for my Government class to watch the
first day of the trial, but I gotta make sure there will be enough
seats.“</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that, Theo,“ Mrs. Hardy said, frowning and
shaking her head. “We’re expecting an overflow crowd. Seating will be
tight.“</p>
<p>“Can I talk to the judge?“</p>
<p>“How many are in your class?“</p>
<p>“Sixteen. I thought maybe we could sit in the balcony.“</p>
<p>She was still frowning as she picked up the phone and pushed a
button. She waited for a second, then said, “Yes, Judge, Theodore Boone
is here and would like to see you. I told him you are very busy.“ She
listened some more, then put down the phone. “Hurry,“ she said, pointing
to the judge’s door. Seconds later, Theo stood before the biggest desk
in town, a desk covered with all sorts of papers and files and thick
binders, a desk that symbolized the enormous power held by Judge Henry
Gantry, who, at that moment, was not smiling. In fact, Theo was certain
the judge had not cracked a smile since he’d interrupted his work. Theo,
though, was pressing hard with a prolonged flash of metal from ear to
ear. “State your case,“ Judge Gantry said. Theo had heard him issue this
command on many occasions. He’d seen lawyers, good lawyers, rise and
stutter and search for words while Judge Gantry scowled down from the
bench. He wasn’t scowling now, nor was he wearing his black robe, but he
was still intimidating. As Theo cleared his throat, he saw an
unmistakable twinkle in his friend’s eye. “Yes, sir, well, my Government
teacher is Mr. Mount, and Mr. Mount thinks we might get approval from
the principal for an all-day field trip to watch the opening of the
trial tomorrow.“ Theo paused, took a deep breath, told himself again to
speak clearly, slowly, forcefully, like all great trial lawyers. “But,
we need guaranteed seats. I was thinking we could sit in the
balcony.“</p>
<p>“ Oh, you were?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“How many?“</p>
<p>“Sixteen, plus Mr. Mount.“</p>
<p>The judge picked up a file, opened it, and began reading as if he’d
suddenly forgotten about Theo standing at attention across the desk.
Theo waited for an awkward fifteen seconds. Then the judge abruptly
said, “Seventeen seats, front balcony, left side. I’ll tell the bailiff
to seat you at ten minutes before nine, tomorrow. I expect perfect
behavior.“</p>
<p>“No problem, sir.“</p>
<p>“I’ll have Mrs. Hardy e-mail a note to your principal.“</p>
<p>“Thanks, Judge.“</p>
<p>“You can go now, Theo. Sorry to be so busy.“</p>
<p>“No problem, sir.“</p>
<p>Theo was scurrying toward the door when the judge said, “Say, Theo.
Do you think Mr. Duffy is guilty?“ Theo stopped, turned around and
without hesitating responded, “He’s presumed innocent.“</p>
<p>“Got that. But what’s your opinion as to his guilt?“</p>
<p>“I think he did it.“</p>
<p>The judge nodded slightly but gave no indication of whether he
agreed. “What about you?“ Theo asked. Finally, a smile. “I’m a fair and
impartial referee, Theo. I have no preconceived notions of guilt or
innocence.“</p>
<p>“That’s what I thought you’d say.“</p>
<p>“See you tomorrow.“ Theo cracked the door and hustled out. Mrs. Hardy
was on her feet, hands on hips, staring</p>
<p>I down two flustered lawyers who were demanding to see the judge. All
three clammed up when Theo walked out of Judge Gantry’s office. He
smiled at Mrs. Hardy as he walked hurriedly by. “Thanks,“ he said as he
opened the door and disappeared.</p>
<p>The ride from the courthouse to the middle school would take fifteen
minutes if properly done, if one obeyed the traffic laws and refrained
from trespassing. And normally this is the way Theo would do things,
except when he was running a bit late. He flew down Market Street the
wrong way, jumped the curb just ahead of a car, and bolted through a
parking lot, used every sidewalk available, then–his most serious
offense–he ducked between two houses on Elm Street. Theo heard someone
yelling from the porch behind him until he was safely into an alley that
ran into the teachers’ parking lot behind his school. He checked his
watch–nine minutes. Not bad.</p>
<p>He parked at the rack by the flagpole, secured his bike with a chain,
then entered with a flood of kids who’d just stepped off a bus. The
eight forty bell was ringing when he walked into his homeroom and said
good morning to Mr. Mount, who not only taught him Government but was
his adviser as well.</p>
<p>“Talked to Judge Gantry,“ Theo said at the teacher’s desk, one
considerably smaller than the one he’d just left in the courthouse. The
room was buzzing with the usual early morning chaos. All sixteen boys
were present and all appeared to be involved in some sort of gag,
scuffle, joke, or shoving match.</p>
<p>“And?“</p>
<p>“Got the seats, first thing in the morning.“</p>
<p>“Excellent. Great job, Theo.“</p>
<p>Mr. Mount eventually restored order, called the roll, made his
announcements, and ten minutes later sent the boys down the hall to
their first period Spanish class with Madame Monique. There was some
awkward flirting between the rooms as the boys mixed with the girls.
During classes, they were “gender-separated,“ according to a new policy
adopted by the smart people in charge of educating all the children in
town. The genders were free to mingle at all other times.</p>
<p>Madame Monique was a tall, dark lady from Cameroon, in West Africa.
She had moved to Strattenburg three years earlier when her husband, also
from Cameroon, took a job at the local college where he taught
languages. She was not the typical teacher at the middle school, far
from it. As a child in Africa, she had grown up speaking Beti, her
tribal dialect, as well as French and English, the official languages of
Cameroon. Her father was a doctor, and thus could afford to send her to
school in Switzerland, where she picked up German and Italian. Her
Spanish had been perfected when she went to college in Madrid. She was
currently working on Russian with plans to move on to Mandarin Chinese.
Her classroom was filled with large, colorful maps of the world, and her
students believed she’d been everywhere, seen everything, and could
speak any language. It’s a big world, she told them many times, and most
people in other countries speak more than one language. While the
students concentrated on Spanish, they were also encouraged to explore
others.</p>
<p>Theo’s mother had been studying Spanish for twenty years, and as a
preschooler he had learned from her many of the basic words and phrases.
Some of her clients were from Central America, and when Theo saw them at
the office he was ready to practice. They always thought it was
cute.</p>
<p>Madame Monique had told him that he had an ear for languages, and
this had inspired him to study harder. She was often asked by her
curious students to “say something in German.“ Or, “Speak some Italian.“
She would, but first the student making the request had to stand and say
a few words in that language. Bonus points were given, and this created
enthusiasm. Most of the boys in Theo’s class knew a few dozen words in
several languages. Aaron, who had a Spanish mother and a German father,
was by far the most talented linguist. But Theo was determined to catch
him. After Government, Spanish was his favorite class, and Madame
Monique ran a close second to Mr. Mount as his favorite teacher.</p>
<p>Today, though, he had trouble concentrating. They were studying
Spanish verbs, a tedious chore on a good day, and Theo’s mind was
elsewhere. He worried about April and her awful day on the witness
stand. He couldn’t imagine the horror of being forced to choose one
parent over another. And when he managed to set April aside, he was
consumed with the murder trial and couldn’t wait until tomorrow, to
watch the opening statements by the lawyers.</p>
<p>Most of his classmates dreamed of getting tickets to the big game or
concert. Theo Boone lived for the big trials.</p>
