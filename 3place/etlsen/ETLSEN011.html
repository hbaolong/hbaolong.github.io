<h4 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h4>
<p>There were a few rough-looking men hanging around the entrance of the
Highland Street Shelter when Theo parked his bike. He walked through
them with a polite “Excuse me“ and a metallic smile, and he really had
no fear because the men wouldn’t bother a kid. The foul odor of stale
booze hung in the air.</p>
<p>“Got any change, kid?“ a scratchy voice said. “No, sir,“ Theo said
without slowing down. Inside, down in the basement, Theo found Julio and
his family finishing dinner. His mother spoke passable English, but it
was obvious she was surprised to see Theo on a Wednesday night. Theo
explained, in what he thought was perfect Spanish, that Julio needed
extra help with his algebra. Evidently, she did not understand perfect
Spanish because she asked Julio what Theo was talking about. Then Hector
began crying about something and she got busy with him.</p>
<p>The cafeteria was packed and overheated, and there were other crying
children. Theo and Julio escaped to a small conference room upstairs,
one that his mother sometimes used to see her shelter clients.</p>
<p>“Did you talk to your cousin?“ Theo asked, after he closed the
door.</p>
<p>“Yes. He said he would come, but I don’t know. He’s very nervous,
Theo. Don’t be surprised if he doesn’t show up.“</p>
<p>“ Okay. Let’s work on the algebra.“</p>
<p>“Do we have to?“</p>
<p>“Julio, you’re making C’s. That’s not good enough. You should be
making B’s.“</p>
<p>After ten minutes they were both bored. Theo couldn’t concentrate
because his mind was on Julio’s cousin and the potential bomb his
testimony would be. Julio was drifting because he hated algebra. Theo’s
cell phone rang.</p>
<p>“It’s my mom,“ he said as he flipped it open.</p>
<p>She was leaving the office and was concerned about him.</p>
<p>He assured her that he was fine, working diligently with Julio, and
would be home in time for Chinese, even though it might be cold Chinese.
What difference did it make, hot or cold?</p>
<p>After he flipped the phone shut, Julio said, “It’s pretty cool that
you have a cell phone.“</p>
<p>“I’m not the only kid in school with a cell phone,“ Theo said. “And
it’s only for local calls, no long distance.“</p>
<p>“Still cool.“</p>
<p>“And it’s just a phone, not a computer.“</p>
<p>“No one in my class has a cell phone.“</p>
<p>“You’re just a seventh grader. Wait till next year. Where do you
suppose your cousin is right now?“</p>
<p>“Let’s call him.“</p>
<p>Theo hesitated, then thought, Why not? He didn’t have all night to
spend with the cousin. He punched the numbers, handed the phone to
Julio, who listened for a few seconds and said, “Voice mail.“</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>The cousin was still wearing a khaki work suit with Waverly Creek
Golf in bold letters across the back of the shirt and in much smaller
letters over the front pocket. His matching cap had the same wording. He
wasn’t much bigger in size than Theo, and certainly looked younger than
eighteen or nineteen. His dark eyes danced around wildly, and before he
even sat down he gave the clear impression that he was ready to
leave.</p>
<p>He refused to shake hands with Theo and refused to give either his
first name or his last. In rapid Spanish he went back and forth with
Julio. The words were tense.</p>
<p>“He wants to know why he should trust you,“ Julio said. Theo was
thankful for the interpretation because he’d understood almost none of
the Spanish.</p>
<p>He said, “Look, Julio, how about a quick review? He came to you, you
came to me, and now I’m here. I didn’t start this process. If he wants
to leave, then good-bye. I’ll be happy to go home.“ It was tough talk
and it sounded pretty strong in English. Julio passed it along in
Spanish, and the cousin glared at Theo as if he’d been insulted.</p>
<p>Theo did not want to leave. He knew he should. He knew better than to
get involved. He’d been telling himself to butt out, but the truth was
that Theo relished being exactly where he was at that moment. “Tell him
he can trust me and that I will not tell anyone what he says,“ he said
to Julio.</p>
<p>Julio passed it along, and the cousin seemed to relax a little.</p>
<p>It was obvious to Theo that the cousin was deeply troubled and wanted
some help. Julio kept rattling on in Spanish. He was heaping praise upon
Theo, who understood some of it.</p>
<p>The cousin smiled.</p>
<p>Theo had printed a color Google Earth Search map of the Creek Course,
and he had marked the Duffy home. The cousin, still unnamed, began to
tell his story. He pointed to a spot in some trees in a dogleg on the
sixth fairway, and spoke rapidly about what he had seen. He’d been
sitting on some timbers near a streambed, just inside the tree line,
eating his lunch, minding his own business, when he saw the man enter
the house from the rear door and exit a few minutes later. Julio gamely
hung on with his interpretation, often stopping his cousin so he could
do the English for Theo. Theo, to his credit, began to understand more
and more of the Spanish as he grew accustomed to the cousin’s speech
patterns.</p>
<p>The cousin described the frenzy around the golf course after the
police showed up and the gossip spread. According to one of his friends,
a kid from Honduras who waited tables in the clubhouse grill, Mr. Duffy
was having a late lunch and a drink when he got the news that his wife
had been found. He made a scene, hustled out, jumped in his golf cart,
and raced home. This friend said that Mr. Duffy was wearing a black
sweater, tan slacks, and a maroon golf cap. It was a perfect match, said
the cousin. The same outfit worn by the man he saw enter the Duffy home
and exit just minutes later.</p>
<p>From his file, Theo produced four photographs of Pete Duffy. All four
had been found online, in the archives of the Strattenburg daily
newspaper. He had enlarged them to 8 by 10 inches. He spread them on the
table and waited. The cousin could not identify Mr. Duffy. He estimated
that he was between sixty to a hundred yards away when he was having his
quiet lunch and saw the man. The man he’d seen looked very similar to
the one in the photographs, but the cousin could not be certain. He was
certain, though, of what the man was wearing.</p>
<p>A positive identification by the cousin would be helpful, but not
crucial. It would be easy to establish how Mr. Duffy was dressed, and
the fact that a witness saw a man in the identical clothing enter the
home just minutes before the murder would nail a conviction, at least in
Theo’s opinion.</p>
<p>As Theo listened to Julio translate into Spanish, he watched the
cousin closely. There was no doubt he was telling the truth. Why would
he not tell the truth? He had nothing to gain by lying, and plenty to
lose! His story was believable. And, it fit perfectly into the
prosecution’s theory of guilt. The problem, though, was that the
prosecution had no idea such a witness even existed.</p>
<p>Theo listened, and again asked himself what he should do next.</p>
<p>The cousin was talking even faster, as if the dam had finally broken
and he wanted to unload everything. Julio was working even harder to
translate. Theo typed feverishly on his laptop, taking as many notes as
possible. He stopped the narrative, asked Julio to repeat something,
then off they went again.</p>
<p>When Theo could think of no more questions, he glanced at his watch
and was surprised at how late it was. It was after 7:00 p.m. and his
parents would not be happy that he was late for dinner. He said he
needed to leave. The cousin asked what would happen next.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,“ Theo answered. “Give me some time. Let me sleep on
it.“</p>
<p>“But you promised not to tell,“ Julio said.</p>
<p>“I won’t tell, Julio. Not until we–the three of us–decide on a
plan.“</p>
<p>“If he gets scared, he’ll just disappear,“ Julio said, nodding at his
cousin. “He cannot get caught. Understand?“</p>
<p>“Of course I understand.“</p>
<p>The chicken chow mein was colder than usual, but Theo had little
appetite for it. The Boones ate on TV trays in the den. Judge, who had
refused dog food since the first week as a member of the family, ate
from his bowl near the television. There was nothing wrong with his
appetite.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you eating?“ his mother said, her chopsticks in
midair.</p>
<p>“I am eating.“</p>
<p>“You seem preoccupied,“ his father said. He used a fork.</p>
<p>“Yes, you do,“ his mother agreed. “Something happen at the
shelter?“</p>
<p>“No, just thinking about Julio and his family and how difficult it
must be for them.“</p>
<p>“You’re such a sweet kid, Teddy.“</p>
<p>If you only knew, Theo thought.</p>
<p>Perry Mason, in black and white, was in the midst of a big trial, and
he was on the verge of losing the case. The judge was fed up with him.
The jurors looked skeptical. The prosecutor was full of confidence.
Suddenly, Perry looked into the crowd of spectators and called the name
of a surprise witness. The witness took the stand and began telling a
story far different from the one the prosecutor had put forth. The new
story made perfect sense. The surprise witness withstood the
cross-examination, and the jury found in favor of Perry Mason’s
client.</p>
<p>Another happy ending. Another courtroom victory.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t work that way,“ Mrs. Boone said. It was something she
managed to say at least three times during every episode. “No such thing
as a surprise witness.“</p>
<p>Theo saw an opening. “But what if a witness suddenly appeared? One
that was crucial to finding the truth? And one that no one knew
about?“</p>
<p>“If no one knew about him, how would he find his way to the
courtroom?“ Mr. Boone asked.</p>
<p>“What if he just appeared?“ Theo replied. “What if an eyewitness read
about the trial in the newspaper, or saw something about it on
television, and came forward. No one knew he existed. No one knew he
witnessed the crime. What would the judge do?“</p>
<p>It was rare that Theo could stump, even briefly, the other two
lawyers in the family. His parents thought about his question. A couple
of things were certain at this point. One, both parents would have an
opinion. Two, there was no way they would agree.</p>
<p>His mother went first. “The prosecution cannot use a witness it has
not disclosed to the court and the defense. The rules prohibit surprise
witnesses.“</p>
<p>“But,“ his father said, almost interrupting and obviously ready to
argue, “if the prosecution doesn’t know about a witness, then the
prosecution cannot disclose his identity. A trial is all about finding
the truth. Denying an eyewitness the chance to testify is the same as
hiding the truth.“</p>
<p>“The rules are the rules.“</p>
<p>“But the rules can be modified by the judge when necessary.“</p>
<p>“A conviction would not stand up on appeal.“</p>
<p>“I’m not so sure about that.“</p>
<p>Back and forth, back and forth. Theo grew quiet. He thought of
reminding his parents that neither specialized in criminal law, but such
a comment would probably draw fire from both. Such discussions were
common in the Boone household, and Theo had learned much about the law
over dinner, on the front porch, even riding down the road in the
backseat.</p>
<p>For example, he had learned that his parents, as lawyers, were
considered to be officers of the court. And as such, they had a duty to
aid in the administration of justice. If other lawyers violated ethics,
or if the police broke the rules, or if a judge got out of line, then
his parents were supposed to take appropriate action. Many lawyers
ignored this responsibility, according to his parents, but not them.</p>
<p>Theo was afraid to tell them about Julio’s cousin. Their sense of
duty would probably force them to go straight to Judge Gantry. The
cousin would be picked up by the police, dragged into court, forced to
testify, then detained as an illegal immigrant. They would put him in
jail, then some sort of detention center, where, according to Mr. Mount,
he might spend months waiting to get shipped back to El Salvador.</p>
<p>Theo’s credibility would be ruined. A family would be seriously
harmed.</p>
<p>But, a guilty man would be convicted. Otherwise, Pete Duffy would
probably walk out of court a free man. He would get away with
murder.</p>
<p>Theo choked down another bite of cold chicken.</p>
<p>He knew he would sleep little.</p>
<p>The nightmares stopped just before sunrise, and Theo abandoned the
notion of somehow finding meaningful rest. He stared at the ceiling of
his bedroom for a long time, waiting for sounds that his parents were up
and moving about. He said good morning to Judge, who slept under the
bed.</p>
<p>Theo had convinced himself many times throughout the night that he
had no choice but to sit down with them early that morning and tell them
the story of Julio’s cousin. He’d changed his mind many times. And he
could not, he decided as he finally eased out of his bed, force himself
to violate the promise he’d made to Julio and his cousin. He could not
tell anyone. If a guilty man was about to walk free, then it wasn’t
Theo’s problem.</p>
<p>Or was it?</p>
<p>He made the usual noise as he went about his morning ritual–shower,
teeth, braces, the daily torture of deciding what to wear. As always, he
thought of Elsa and her irritating habit of quickly inspecting his
shirt, pants, and shoes to make sure it all matched and that none of it
had been worn in the past three days.</p>
<p>He heard his father leave a few minutes before seven. He heard his
mother in the den watching an early morning television show. At exactly
seven thirty, Theo closed the door to his bathroom, opened his cell
phone, and called Uncle Ike.</p>
<p>Ike was not an early riser. His sad little career of a smalltime tax
man wasn’t very demanding, and he didn’t start the day with a rush of
enthusiasm. His work was dreary, something he had mentioned to Theo on
many occasions. And there was another problem. Ike drank too much, and
this unfortunate habit made for slow mornings. Over the years, Theo had
heard the adults whispering about Ike’s drinking. Elsa had once asked
Vince a question dealing with Ike, and Vince replied with a curt, “Maybe
if he’s sober.“ Theo wasn’t supposed to hear that, but Theo heard a lot
more around the office than the others knew.</p>
<p>The call was finally answered with a scratchy and rude, “Is this
Theo?“</p>
<p>“Yes, Ike, good morning. Sorry to bother you so early.“ Theo was
speaking as softly as possible into the phone.</p>
<p>“No problem, Theo. I assume you have something on your mind.“</p>
<p>“Yes, can we talk this morning, early? At your office? Something real
important has come up and I’m not sure I can discuss it with my
parents.“</p>
<p>“Well, sure, Theo. What time?“</p>
<p>“Maybe a few minutes after eight. School starts at eight thirty. If I
leave too early Mom will get suspicious.“</p>
<p>“Sure. I’d love to.“</p>
<p>“Thanks, Ike.“</p>
<p>Theo hurried through breakfast, kissed his mom goodbye, spoke to
Judge, and was on his bike racing down Mallard Lane at straight-up eight
o’clock.</p>
