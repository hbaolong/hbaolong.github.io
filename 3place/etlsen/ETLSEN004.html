<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>The law firm of Boone andandandand Boone had its offices in an old
converted house on Park Street, three blocks off of Main and a
ten-minute walk to the courthouse. There were lots of lawyers in the
neighborhood, and all the houses on Park had become the offices of
attorneys, architects, accountants, engineers, and so on.</p>
<p>The firm had two lawyers, Mr. Boone and Mrs. Boone, and they were
equal partners in every sense of the word. Mr. Boone, Theo’s father, was
in his early fifties, but seemed to be much older, at least in Theo’s
well-kept opinion. His first name was Woods, which, to Theo, seemed more
suited for a surname. Tiger Woods, the golfer. James Woods, the actor.
Theo was still searching for another human being with the first name of
Woods, though he didn’t spend a lot of time worrying about this slight
nuisance. He tried not to worry about things out of his control.</p>
<p>Woods Boone. Sometimes, Theo pronounced the name quickly and it
sounded like woodspoon. He’d checked and woodspoon wasn’t really a word,
but he thought it should be. A spoon made from wood is known as a wooden
spoon, not a woodspoon. But who uses a wooden spoon? Why worry about
such trivial matters? Anyway, like one of those annoying habits you
can’t break, Theo thought of the word woodspoon every time he approached
the door to his father’s office and saw his name stenciled in black
lettering.</p>
<p>His office was on the second floor, up some rickety steps covered
with stained and threadbare carpet. Mr. Boone was on the second floor,
alone, because the ladies below had sent him there for two reasons.
First, he was a slob and his office was a wreck, though Theo loved it.
Second, and much more offensive, Mr. Boone smoked a pipe, and preferred
to do so with the windows closed and the ceiling fan off so that the air
was thick with the rich aroma of whatever flavored tobacco he happened
to favor that day. The smoke didn’t bother Theo, either, though he did
worry about his father’s health. Mr. Boone was not exactly concerned
with fitness. He exercised little and was a bit on the heavy side. He
worked hard but left his problems at the office, unlike his law partner,
Theo’s mom.</p>
<p>Mr. Boone was a real estate lawyer, and in Theo’s opinion this was
the most boring of all areas of the law. His father never went to court,
never argued before a judge, never addressed a jury, never, it seemed,
left the office. In fact, he often referred to himself as an “office
lawyer,“ and appeared pleased with such a title. Theo certainly admired
his father, but he had no plans to spend his career locked away in some
office. No, sir. Theo was headed for the courtroom.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Boone was alone on the second floor, his office was huge.
Long, saggy bookshelves lined two of the walls and on the other two were
ever-expanding collections of framed photographs depicting Woods doing
all sorts of important things–shaking hands with politicians, posing
with lawyers at bar meetings, and so on. Theo had seen the inside of
several other lawyers’ offices in town–he was quite nosy and always
looking for an open door–and he’d already learned that lawyers loved to
cover their walls with such photos, along with diplomas and awards and
certificates of membership in this club or that. The Ego Wall, his
mother called it, sneering, because her walls were practically bare,
with only a few pieces of some baffling modern art hanging about.</p>
<p>Theo knocked on the door as he pushed it open. He was expected to say
hello to both parents each afternoon after school, unless he was busy
elsewhere. His father sat alone behind an ancient desk that was covered
with piles of paper. His father was always alone because his clients
seldom stopped by. They called or sent stuff by mail or fax or e-mail,
but they didn’t need to visit Boone andandandand Boone to get
advice.</p>
<p>“Hello,“ Theo said as he fell into a chair.</p>
<p>“A good day at school?“ his father asked, the same question every
day.</p>
<p>“Pretty good. The principal approved our field trip to go to court
tomorrow. I saw Judge Gantry this morning and he promised seats in the
balcony.“</p>
<p>“That was nice. You’re lucky. Half the town will be there.“</p>
<p>“Are you going?“</p>
<p>“Me? No,“ his father said, waving at the piles of paper as if they
required immediate attention. Theo had overheard a conversation between
his parents in which they had vowed not to stop by the courtroom during
the murder trial. They were busy lawyers themselves, and, well, it just
didn’t seem right to waste time watching someone else’s trial. But Theo
knew that they, like everyone else in town, wanted to be there.</p>
<p>His father, and his mother to a lesser extent, used the excuse of too
much legal work when they wanted to avoid doing something. “How long
will the trial last?“ Theo asked.</p>
<p>“The word on the street is that it might take a week.“</p>
<p>“I’d sure like to watch all of it.“</p>
<p>“Don’t even think about it, Theo. I’ve already talked to Judge
Gantry. If he sees you in the courtroom when you’re supposed to be in
school, he will stop the trial, order a bailiff to take you into
custody, and haul you away. I will not bail you out of jail. You’ll sit
there for days with common drunks and gang members.“ With that,
Mr. Boone picked up a pipe, fired a small torch into its bowl, and began
blowing smoke. They stared at each other. Theo wasn’t sure if his father
was joking, but his face certainly looked serious. He and Judge Gantry
were old friends. “Are you kidding?“ Theo finally asked.</p>
<p>“Partially. I’m sure I’d fetch you from jail, but I have talked to
Judge Gantry.“</p>
<p>Theo was already thinking of ways to watch the trial without being
seen by Judge Gantry. Skipping school would be the easy part. “Now shove
off,“ Mr. Boone said. “Let’s get the homework done.“</p>
<p>“See you later.“</p>
<p>Downstairs, the front door was guarded by a woman who was almost as
old as the office itself. Her first name was Elsa. Her last name was
Miller, though this was off-limits to Theo and everyone else. Regardless
of her age, and no one knew it for certain, she insisted on being called
Elsa. Even by a thirteen-year-old. Elsa had worked for the Boones since
long before Theo was born. She was the receptionist, secretary, office
manager, and paralegal when needed. She ran the firm, and occasionally
she was forced to referee the little spats and disagreements between
lawyer Boone upstairs and lawyer Boone downstairs.</p>
<p>Elsa was a very important person in the lives of all three Boones.
Theo considered her a friend and confidante. “Hello, Elsa,“ he said as
he stopped at her desk and prepared to give her a hug.</p>
<p>She jumped from her chair, bubbly as always, and squeezed him
tightly. Then she looked at his chest and said, “Didn’t you wear that
shirt Friday?“</p>
<p>“I did not.“ And he did not.</p>
<p>“I think you did.“</p>
<p>“Sorry, Elsa.“ She often commented on his attire, and, for a
thirteen-year-old boy this was tiresome. However, it kept Theo on his
toes. Someone was always watching and taking notes, and he often thought
of Elsa when he hurriedly got dressed each morning. Another irritating
habit he couldn’t shake. Her own wardrobe was legendary. She was short
and very petite–“could wear anything,“ his mother had said many
times–and preferred tight clothing in bold colors. Today, she was
wearing black leather pants with some sort of funky green sweater that
reminded Theo of asparagus. Her short gray hair was shiny and spiked.
Her eyeglasses, as always, matched the color of her outfit–green today.
Elsa was anything but dull. She might be pushing seventy, but she was
not aging quietly. “Is my mother in?“ Theo asked. “Yes, and the door is
open.“ She was back in her chair. Theo was walking away. “Thank
you.“</p>
<p>“ One of your friends called.“</p>
<p>“Who?“</p>
<p>“Said his name was Sandy and he might be stopping by.“</p>
<p>“Thanks.“</p>
<p>Theo walked along the hallway. He stopped at one door and said hello
to Dorothy, the real estate secretary, a nice lady who was as boring as
her boss upstairs. He stopped at another door and said hello to Vince,
their longtime paralegal who worked on Mrs. Boone’s cases. Marcella
Boone was on the phone when Theo walked in and took a seat. Her desk,
glass and chrome, was neatly organized with most of the surface visible,
a sharp contrast to her husband’s. Her current files were in a tidy rack
behind her. Everything was in place, except her shoes, which were not on
her feet but parked nearby. The shoes were heels, which to Theo meant
that she had been in court during the day. She was in a courtroom
outfit–a burgundy skirt and jacket. His mother was always pretty and put
together, but she made an extra effort on those days when she went to
court. “The men can look like slobs,“ she said many times. “But the
women are expected to look nice. What’s fair about that?“</p>
<p>Elsa always agreed that it wasn’t fair.</p>
<p>The truth was that Mrs. Boone enjoyed spending money on clothes and
looking nice. Mr. Boone cared nothing for fashion and even less for
neatness. He was only three years older in age, but at least a decade in
spirit. At the moment, she was talking to a judge, one who did not agree
with her. When she finally hung up, her attitude changed quickly. With a
smile she said, “Hello, my dear. How was your day?“</p>
<p>“ Great, Mom. And yours?“</p>
<p>“The usual. Any excitement at school?“</p>
<p>“Just a field trip tomorrow, to watch the trial. Are you going?“</p>
<p>She was already shaking her head no. “I have a hearing at ten in
front of Judge Sanford. I’m too busy to sit through a trial, Theo.“</p>
<p>“Dad says he’s already talked to Judge Gantry, and they’ve cooked up
a plan to keep me away from the trial. Do you believe it?“</p>
<p>“I certainly hope so. School is a priority.“</p>
<p>“School is boring, Mom. I enjoy two classes. Everything else is a
waste of time.“</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say your education is a waste.“</p>
<p>“I can learn more in the courtroom.“</p>
<p>“Perhaps, but you’ll have a chance to spend plenty of time there one
day. For now, though, we’re concentrating on the eighth grade.
Okay?“</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about taking a few law courses online. There’s a cool
website that offers some great stuff.“</p>
<p>“Theodore, honey, you’re not ready for law school. We’ve had this
conversation. Let’s enjoy the eighth grade, then off to high school,
then beyond. You’re just a kid, okay? Enjoy being a kid.“ He sort of
shrugged, said nothing.</p>
<p>“Now, let’s get the homework done.“</p>
<p>Her phone buzzed and Elsa was sending back another important call.
“Now, excuse me, Teddy, and please smile,“ Mrs. Boone said. Theo eased
out of the office. He carried his backpack through the copy room, always
a mess, and worked his way through two storage rooms packed with large
boxes of old files.</p>
<p>Theo was certain that he was the only eighth grader in Strattenburg
with his own law office. It was a small boxlike closet that someone had
added to the main house decades earlier, and before Theo took it over
the firm had used it to store old law books that were out of date. His
desk was a card table that was not quite as neat as his mother’s but
much more organized than his father’s. His chair was a ragged swivel
unit he’d saved from the junk pile when his parents had refurbished the
library up front near Elsa’s station.</p>
<p>Sitting in his chair was his dog. Judge spent each day at the office,
sleeping or roaming quietly around, trying to avoid the humans because
they were always so busy. He was routinely kicked out of meetings. Late
in the day, he eased back to Theo’s office, climbed into his chair, and
waited.</p>
<p>“Hello, Judge,“ Theo said as he rubbed his head. “Have you had a busy
day?“</p>
<p>Judge jumped to the floor, tail wagging, a very happy dog. Theo
settled into his chair and put his backpack on the desk. He looked
around the room. On one wall he’d tacked a large Twins poster with this
season’s schedule. To his knowledge, he was the only Twins fan in town.
Minnesota was a thousand miles away and Theo had never been there. He
pulled for the team because no one else in Strattenburg did so. He felt
it only fair that they have at least one fan in town. He’d chosen the
Twins years earlier, and now clung to them with a fierce loyalty that
was tested throughout the long season.</p>
<p>On another wall, there was a large, cartoonish sketch of Theo Boone,
Attorney-at-Law, wearing a suit and a tie and standing in court. A gavel
was flying by his head, barely missing him, and the caption read,
“Overruled!“ In the background, the jurors were howling with laughter,
at Theo’s expense. At the bottom right-hand corner the artist had
scribbled her name, April Finnemore. She had given the sketch to Theo a
year earlier, for his birthday. Her dream was to run away to Paris now,
and spend the rest of her life drawing and painting street scenes.</p>
<p>A door led to a small porch that led to the backyard, which was
covered with gravel and used for parking.</p>
<p>As usual, he unloaded his backpack and started his homework, which
had to be finished before dinner, according to a rather rigid rule
established by his parents when he was in the first grade. An asthma
condition kept Theo away from the team sports he longed to play, but it
also ensured straight A’s in school. Over the years, he had grudgingly
accepted the fact that his academic success was a good substitute for
the games he missed. He could play golf, though, and he and his father
teed off every Saturday morning at nine. There was a knock on the back
door. Judge, who kept a bed under the desk, growled softly. Sandy Coe
was also in the eighth grade at the middle school, but in a different
section. Theo knew him but not well. He was a pleasant boy who said
little. He needed to talk, and Theo welcomed him to his room. Sandy took
the only other chair, a folding one that Theo kept in a corner. When
they were both seated, the room was full. “Can we talk in private?“
Sandy asked. He seemed shy, and nervous.</p>
<p>“Sure. What’s up?“</p>
<p>“Well, I need some advice, I think. I’m really not sure about this,
but I gotta talk to someone.“ Theo, the counselor, said, “I promise
anything you say is kept in secret.“</p>
<p>“Good. Well, my dad got laid off a few months ago, and, well, things
are pretty bad around the house.“ He paused, waiting for Theo to say
something. “I’m sorry.“</p>
<p>“And last night my parents were having this real serious talk in the
kitchen, and I should not have been listening, but I couldn’t help it.
Do you know what foreclosure means?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“What is it?“</p>
<p>“There are a lot of foreclosures these days. It means that a person
who owns a home can’t make the mortgage payments and the bank wants to
take the house.“</p>
<p>“I don’t understand any of this.“</p>
<p>“Okay. It works like this.“ Theo grabbed a paperback and placed it in
the center of his desk. “Let’s say that this is a house and you want to
buy it. It costs a hundred thousand dollars, and since you don’t have a
hundred thousand dollars, you go to the bank and borrow the money.“ He
placed a textbook next to the paperback. “This is the bank.“</p>
<p>“Got it.“</p>
<p>“The bank loans you the hundred thousand, and now you’re able to buy
the house from whoever is selling it. You agree to pay the bank, say
five hundred dollars a month, for thirty years.“</p>
<p>“Thirty years?“</p>
<p>“Yep. That’s the typical deal. The bank charges an extra fee for
making the loan–it’s called interest–so each month you pay back part of
the hundred thousand plus a chunk for interest. It’s a good deal for
everybody. You get the house you want, and the bank makes money on the
interest. All is well until something happens and you can’t make the
monthly payments.“</p>
<p>“What’s a mortgage?“</p>
<p>“A deal like this is called a mortgage. The bank has a claim on the
house until the loan is paid off. When you fall behind on the monthly
payments, the bank has the right to come in and take the house. The bank
kicks you out, and it owns the house. That’s a foreclosure.“ He placed
the textbook on top of the paperback, smothering it. “My mom was crying
when they were talking about moving out. We’ve lived there since I was
born.“ Theo opened his laptop and turned it on. “It’s terrible,“ he
said. “And it’s happening a lot these days.“ Sandy lowered his head and
appeared to be devastated. “What’s your father’s name?“</p>
<p>“Thomas. Thomas Coe.“</p>
<p>“And your mother?“</p>
<p>“ Evelyn.“</p>
<p>Theo pecked away. “What’s your address?“</p>
<p>“Eight fourteen Bennington.“</p>
<p>More pecking. They waited, then Theo said, “Oh boy.“</p>
<p>“What is it?“</p>
<p>“The bank is Security Trust, on Main Street. Fourteen years ago your
parents borrowed a hundred and twenty thousand for a thirty-year
mortgage. They have not made the monthly payments in four months.“</p>
<p>“Four months?“</p>
<p>“Yep.“</p>
<p>“All this stuff is online?“</p>
<p>“Yes, but not just anybody can find it.“</p>
<p>“How’d you find it?“</p>
<p>“There are ways. A lot of law offices pay a fee to gain access to
certain data. Plus, I know how to dig a little deeper.“ Sandy sank even
lower and shook his head. “So we’re gonna lose our house?“</p>
<p>“Not exactly.“</p>
<p>“What do you mean? My dad’s not working.“</p>
<p>“There’s a way to stop the foreclosure, stiff-arm the bank, and keep
the house for a while, maybe until your dad goes back to work.“ Sandy
looked thoroughly bewildered. “You ever heard of bankruptcy?“ Theo
asked. “I guess, but I don’t understand it.“</p>
<p>“It’s your only choice. Your parents will be forced to file for
bankruptcy protection. This means they hire a lawyer who’ll file some
papers in Bankruptcy Court on their behalf.“</p>
<p>“How much do lawyers cost?“</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that now. The important thing is to go see a
lawyer.“</p>
<p>“You can’t do it?“</p>
<p>“Sorry. And my parents are not bankruptcy lawyers. But there is a guy
two doors down, Steve Mozingo, and he’s very good. My parents send
clients to him. They like him a lot.“ Sandy scribbled down the name.
“And you think we might get to keep our house?“</p>
<p>“Yes, but your parents need to see this guy as soon as possible.“</p>
<p>“Thanks, Theo. I don’t know what to say.“</p>
<p>“No problem. Happy to help.“ Sandy hurried through the door, as if he
might sprint home with the good news. Theo watched him get on his bike
and disappear through the back parking lot. Another satisfied
client.</p>
<p>At fifteen minutes before 5:00 p.m., Mrs. Boone walked into Theo’s
office with a folder in one hand and a document in another. “Theo,“ she
said, her reading glasses halfway down her nose. “Would you run these
over to Family Court and get them filed before five?“</p>
<p>“Sure, Mom.“</p>
<p>Theo was on his feet, reaching for his backpack. He had been hoping
that from some corner of the firm someone would need something filed in
the courthouse. “Your homework is finished, isn’t it?“</p>
<p>“Yes. I didn’t have much.“</p>
<p>“Good. And today is Monday. You’ll pay a visit to Ike, won’t you? It
means a lot to him.“</p>
