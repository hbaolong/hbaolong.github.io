<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>The law firm of Boone &amp; Boone had its offices in an old converted
house on Park Street, three blocks off of Main and a ten-minute walk to
the courthouse. There were lots of lawyers in the neighborhood, and all
the houses on Park had become the offices of attorneys, architects,
accountants, engineers, and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>attorney,英 [əˈtɜːni] 美 [əˈtɜːrni] n. 律师；代理人</p></li>
<li><p>architect,英 [ˈɑːkɪtekt] 美 [ˈɑːrkɪtekt]
n. 建筑师；设计师，缔造者</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The firm had two lawyers, Mr. Boone and Mrs. Boone, and they were
equal partners in every sense of the word. Mr. Boone, Theo’s father, was
in his early fifties, but seemed to be much older, at least in Theo’s
well-kept opinion. His first name was Woods, which, to Theo, seemed more
suited for a surname. Tiger Woods, the golfer. James Woods, the actor.
Theo was still searching for another human being with the first name of
Woods, though he didn’t spend a lot of time worrying about this slight
nuisance. He tried not to worry about things out of his control.</p>
<ul>
<li>surname,英 [ˈsɜːneɪm] 美 [ˈsɜːrneɪm] n. 姓；绰号，别名 v.
给······姓氏，给······起别名</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="what-is-first-name"><a href="./hash/0001.html">what is first

<ul>
<li><p>slight,英 [slaɪt] 美 [slaɪt] adj.
轻微的，少量的；（人）瘦小的，纤弱的；（尤指创作）不深奥的，不重要的 v.
怠慢，轻视；<古>破坏，摧毁（防御工事） n. 冒犯，冷落</p></li>
<li><p>nuisance,英 [ˈnjuːsns] 美 [ˈnuːs(ə)ns]
n. 麻烦事，讨厌的人（或事物、情况）；损害，妨害；骚扰行为，妨害行为</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Woods Boone. Sometimes, Theo pronounced the name quickly and it
sounded like woodspoon. He’d checked and woodspoon wasn’t really a word,
but he thought it should be. A spoon made from wood is known as a wooden
spoon, not a woodspoon. But who uses a wooden spoon? Why worry about
such trivial matters? Anyway, like one of those annoying habits you
can’t break, Theo thought of the word woodspoon every time he approached
the door to his father’s office and saw his name stenciled in black
lettering.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>trivial,英 [ˈtrɪviəl] 美 [ˈtrɪviəl] adj.
琐碎的，不重要的；容易解决的，不费吹灰之力的；（人）务小的，浅薄的；（数学）平凡的</p></li>

<li><p>stencil,英 [ˈstensl] 美 [ˈstensl] n. 漏字板</p></li>
</ul>
<p>His office was on the second floor, up some rickety steps covered
with stained and threadbare carpet. Mr. Boone was on the second floor,
alone, because the ladies below had sent him there for two reasons.
First, he was a slob and his office was a wreck, though Theo loved it.
Second, and much more offensive, Mr. Boone smoked a pipe, and preferred
to do so with the windows closed and the ceiling fan off so that the air
was thick with the rich aroma of whatever flavored tobacco he happened
to favor that day. The smoke didn’t bother Theo, either, though he did
worry about his father’s health. Mr. Boone was not exactly concerned
with fitness. He exercised little and was a bit on the heavy side. He
worked hard but left his problems at the office, unlike his law partner,
Theo’s mom.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>rickety,英 [ˈrɪkəti] 美 [ˈrɪkəti] adj.

破坏，断送（计划、关系等）；（严重）破坏，毁坏（车辆或建筑物）；造成（船舶）失事，使遇难；<史>毁船打劫；<美>（为获取有用的零件、碎料而）拆，拆除（破汽车、旧建筑物等）；营救失事船只；失事

</ul>
<p>Mr. Boone was a real estate lawyer, and in Theo’s opinion this was
the most boring of all areas of the law. His father never went to court,
never argued before a judge, never addressed a jury, never, it seemed,
left the office. In fact, he often referred to himself as an “office
lawyer,“and appeared pleased with such a title. Theo certainly admired
his father, but he had no plans to spend his career locked away in some
office. No, sir. Theo was headed for the courtroom.</p>
<ul>
<li>estate,英 [ɪˈsteɪt] 美 [ɪˈsteɪt]
n. 财产，遗产；大片私有土地，庄园；<英>住宅区，工业区；<旧>社会阶层；（生活）状况，条件</li>
</ul>
<p>Because Mr. Boone was alone on the second floor, his office was huge.
Long, saggy bookshelves lined two of the walls and on the other two were
ever-expanding collections of framed photographs depicting Woods doing
all sorts of important things–shaking hands with politicians, posing
with lawyers at bar meetings, and so on. Theo had seen the inside of
several other lawyers’ offices in town–he was quite nosy and always
looking for an open door–and he’d already learned that lawyers loved to
cover their walls with such photos, along with diplomas and awards and
certificates of membership in this club or that. The Ego Wall, his
mother called it, sneering, because her walls were practically bare,
with only a few pieces of some baffling modern art hanging about.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>saggy,英 [ˈsæɡi] 美 [ˈsæɡi] adj. 下垂的；松懈的</p></li>
<li><p>nosy,英 [ˈnəʊzi] 美 [ˈnoʊzi] adj. 好管闲事的，爱打听的
n. &lt;英，非正式&gt;（尤指对属于他人之地或隐秘处所的）彻底查看 v.
窥探，打听</p></li>
<li><p>sneer，英 [snɪə(r)] 美 [snɪr] v. 嘲笑，讥讽；鄙视
n. 嘲笑，讥讽</p></li>
<li><p>baffle,英 [ˈbæf(ə)l] 美 [ˈbæf(ə)l] v. 使困惑，难住；抑制，控制
n. 挡板，隔板，反射板</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Theo knocked on the door as he pushed it open. He was expected to say
hello to both parents each afternoon after school, unless he was busy
elsewhere. His father sat alone behind an ancient desk that was covered
with piles of paper. His father was always alone because his clients
seldom stopped by. They called or sent stuff by mail or fax or e-mail,
but they didn’t need to visit Boone &amp; Boone to get advice.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>pile,英 [paɪl] 美 [paɪl]
n. 一堆，一叠；一大堆，大量；大笔钱财；（地毯的）绒面；地桩；宏伟建筑物；痔疮；（纹章）（尖头朝下的）楔形普通图记；电池组
v. 堆放；堆满；聚集；将（女子头发）高高盘起；蜂拥，拥挤；（车）撞（~
into）；<非正式>夸大（~ something on）；用桩加固（或支撑）</p></li>
<li><p>stop by,顺便拜访：非正式用语：短暂地拜访某人。</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“Hello,“Theo said as he fell into a chair.</p>
<p>“A good day at school?“his father asked, the same question every
day.</p>
<p>“Pretty good. The principal approved our field trip to go to court
tomorrow. I saw Judge Gantry this morning and he promised seats in the
balcony.“</p>
<p>“That was nice. You’re lucky. Half the town will be there.“</p>
<p>“Are you going?“</p>
<p>“Me? No,“his father said, waving at the piles of paper as if they
required immediate attention. Theo had overheard a conversation between
his parents in which they had vowed not to stop by the courtroom during
the murder trial. They were busy lawyers themselves, and, well, it just
didn’t seem right to waste time watching someone else’s trial. But Theo
knew that they, like everyone else in town, wanted to be there.</p>
<p>His father, and his mother to a lesser extent, used the excuse of too
much legal work when they wanted to avoid doing something. “How long
will the trial last?“Theo asked.</p>
<p>“The word on the street is that it might take a week.“</p>
<p>“I’d sure like to watch all of it.“</p>
<p>“Don’t even think about it, Theo. I’ve already talked to Judge
Gantry. If he sees you in the courtroom when you’re supposed to be in
school, he will stop the trial, order a bailiff to take you into
custody, and haul you away. I will not bail you out of jail. You’ll sit
there for days with common drunks and gang members.“With that, Mr. Boone
picked up a pipe, fired a small torch into its bowl, and began blowing
smoke. They stared at each other. Theo wasn’t sure if his father was
joking, but his face certainly looked serious. He and Judge Gantry were
old friends. “Are you kidding?“Theo finally asked.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>bailiff,英 [ˈbeɪlɪf] 美 [ˈbeɪlɪf]
n. 法警；执行官；区镇的地方长官</p></li>
<li><p>custody,英 [ˈkʌstədi] 美 [ˈkʌstədi]

Judge Gantry.“</p>
<ul>
<li>Partially,英 [ˈpɑːʃəli] 美 [ˈpɑːrʃəli] adv.
不完全地，部分地；<古>偏袒地</li>
</ul>
<p>Theo was already thinking of ways to watch the trial without being
seen by Judge Gantry. Skipping school would be the easy part. “Now shove
off,“Mr. Boone said. “Let’s get the homework done.“</p>
<ul>
<li>shove,英 [ʃʌv] 美 [ʃʌv] v. 猛推，乱挤；连推带挤地走；<非正式>
随便放置，乱放（某物）；<非正式>移动身体，挪动身体（以腾出地方）；<非正式>去他的，让……见鬼
n. 猛推</li>
</ul>
<p>“See you later.“</p>
<p>Downstairs, the front door was guarded by a woman who was almost as
old as the office itself. Her first name was Elsa. Her last name was
Miller, though this was off-limits to Theo and everyone else. Regardless
of her age, and no one knew it for certain, she insisted on being called
Elsa. Even by a thirteen-year-old. Elsa had worked for the Boones since
long before Theo was born. She was the receptionist, secretary, office
manager, and paralegal when needed. She ran the firm, and occasionally
she was forced to referee the little spats and disagreements between
lawyer Boone upstairs and lawyer Boone downstairs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>receptionist,英 [rɪˈsepʃənɪst] 美 [rɪˈsepʃənɪst]

<li><p>spat,英 [spæt] 美 [spæt] n. 口角；蚝卵；蚝仔；掌击 vi.
争吵；一巴掌打去 v. 吐口水（spit 的过去式）</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Elsa was a very important person in the lives of all three Boones.
Theo considered her a friend and confidante. “Hello, Elsa,“he said as he
stopped at her desk and prepared to give her a hug.</p>
<ul>
<li>confidante,英 [ˌkɒnfɪˈdænt] 美 [ˌkɑːnfɪˈdænt; ˌkɑːnfɪˈdɑːnt;
ˈkɑːnfɪˌdænt; ˈkɑːnfɪˌdɑːnt] n. 知心女友，女性知己</li>
</ul>
<p>She jumped from her chair, bubbly as always, and squeezed him
tightly. Then she looked at his chest and said, “Didn’t you wear that
shirt Friday?“</p>
<p>“I did not.“And he did not.</p>
<p>“I think you did.“</p>
<p>“Sorry, Elsa.“She often commented on his attire, and, for a
thirteen-year-old boy this was tiresome. However, it kept Theo on his
toes. Someone was always watching and taking notes, and he often thought
of Elsa when he hurriedly got dressed each morning. Another irritating
habit he couldn’t shake. Her own wardrobe was legendary. She was short
and very petite–“could wear anything,“his mother had said many times–and
preferred tight clothing in bold colors. Today, she was wearing black
leather pants with some sort of funky green sweater that reminded Theo
of asparagus. Her short gray hair was shiny and spiked. Her eyeglasses,
as always, matched the color of her outfit–green today. Elsa was
anything but dull. She might be pushing seventy, but she was not aging
quietly. “Is my mother in?“Theo asked. “Yes, and the door is open.“She
was back in her chair. Theo was walking away. “Thank you.“</p>
<ul>
<li><p>attire,英 [əˈtaɪə(r)] 美 [əˈtaɪər] n. <正式>服装，衣服 v.
着装</p></li>
<li><p>wardrobe,英 [ˈwɔːdrəʊb] 美 [ˈwɔːrdroʊb]
n. 衣柜，衣橱；（某人的）全部服装；（剧院、电视台等的）服装部，戏装管理部</p></li>
<li><p>legendary,英 [ˈledʒəndri] 美 [ˈledʒənderi] adj.
非常有名的，大名鼎鼎的；传说（中）的</p></li>
<li><p>petite,英 [pəˈtiːt] 美 [pəˈtiːt] adj.

</ul>
<p>“One of your friends called.“</p>
<p>“Who?“</p>
<p>“Said his name was Sandy and he might be stopping by.“</p>
<p>“Thanks.“</p>
<p>Theo walked along the hallway. He stopped at one door and said hello
to Dorothy, the real estate secretary, a nice lady who was as boring as
her boss upstairs. He stopped at another door and said hello to Vince,
their longtime paralegal who worked on Mrs. Boone’s cases. Marcella
Boone was on the phone when Theo walked in and took a seat. Her desk,
glass and chrome, was neatly organized with most of the surface visible,
a sharp contrast to her husband’s. Her current files were in a tidy rack
behind her. Everything was in place, except her shoes, which were not on
her feet but parked nearby. The shoes were heels, which to Theo meant
that she had been in court during the day. She was in a courtroom
outfit–a burgundy skirt and jacket. His mother was always pretty and put
together, but she made an extra effort on those days when she went to
court. <strong>“The men can look like slobs,“she said many times. “But
the women are expected to look nice. What’s fair about
that?“</strong></p>
<ul>

<p>Elsa always agreed that it wasn’t fair.</p>
<p>The truth was that Mrs. Boone enjoyed spending money on clothes and
looking nice. Mr. Boone cared nothing for fashion and even less for
neatness. <strong>He was only three years older in age, but at least a
decade in spirit.</strong> At the moment, she was talking to a judge,
one who did not agree with her. When she finally hung up, her attitude
changed quickly. With a smile she said, “Hello, my dear. How was your
day?“</p>
<ul>
<li>neatness,英 [ˈniːtnəs] 美 [ˈniːtnəs] n. 干净，整洁</li>

<p>“Great, Mom. And yours?“</p>
<p>“The usual. Any excitement at school?“</p>
<p>“Just a field trip tomorrow, to watch the trial. Are you going?“</p>
<p>She was already shaking her head no. “I have a hearing at ten in
front of Judge Sanford. I’m too busy to sit through a trial, Theo.“</p>
<p>“Dad says he’s already talked to Judge Gantry, and they’ve cooked up
a plan to keep me away from the trial. Do you believe it?“</p>
<p>“I certainly hope so. School is a priority.“</p>
<p>“School is boring, Mom. I enjoy two classes. Everything else is a
waste of time.“</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say your education is a waste.“</p>
<p>“I can learn more in the courtroom.“</p>
<p>“Perhaps, but you’ll have a chance to spend plenty of time there one
day. For now, though, we’re concentrating on the eighth grade.
Okay?“</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about taking a few law courses online. There’s a cool
website that offers some great stuff.“</p>
<p>“Theodore, honey, you’re not ready for law school. We’ve had this
conversation. Let’s enjoy the eighth grade, then off to high school,
then beyond. You’re just a kid, okay? Enjoy being a kid.“He sort of
shrugged, said nothing.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s get the homework done.“</p>
<p>Her phone buzzed and Elsa was sending back another important call.
“Now, excuse me, Teddy, and please smile,“Mrs. Boone said. Theo eased
out of the office. He carried his backpack through the copy room, always
a mess, and worked his way through two storage rooms packed with large
boxes of old files.</p>

<p>Theo was certain that he was the only eighth grader in Strattenburg
with his own law office. It was a small boxlike closet that someone had
added to the main house decades earlier, and before Theo took it over
the firm had used it to store old law books that were out of date.
<strong>His desk was a card table that was not quite as neat as his
mother’s but much more organized than his father’s.</strong> His chair
was a ragged swivel unit he’d saved from the junk pile when his parents
had refurbished the library up front near Elsa’s station.</p>
<p>Sitting in his chair was his dog. Judge spent each day at the office,
sleeping or roaming quietly around, trying to avoid the humans because
they were always so busy. He was routinely kicked out of meetings. Late
in the day, he eased back to Theo’s office, climbed into his chair, and
waited.</p>
<ul>
<li>routinely,英 [ruːˈtiːnli] 美 [ruːˈtiːnli] adv.

<p>“Hello, Judge,“Theo said as he rubbed his head. “Have you had a busy
day?“</p>
<p>Judge jumped to the floor, tail wagging, a very happy dog. Theo
settled into his chair and put his backpack on the desk. He looked
around the room. On one wall he’d tacked a large Twins poster with this
season’s schedule. To his knowledge, he was the only Twins fan in town.
Minnesota was a thousand miles away and Theo had never been there. He
pulled for the team because no one else in Strattenburg did so. He felt
it only fair that they have at least one fan in town. He’d chosen the
Twins years earlier, and now clung to them with a fierce loyalty that
was tested throughout the long season.</p>

<p>On another wall, there was a large, cartoonish sketch of Theo Boone,
Attorney-at-Law, wearing a suit and a tie and standing in court. A gavel
was flying by his head, barely missing him, and the caption read,
“Overruled!“In the background, the jurors were howling with laughter, at
Theo’s expense. At the bottom right-hand corner the artist had scribbled
her name, April Finnemore. She had given the sketch to Theo a year
earlier, for his birthday. Her dream was to run away to Paris now, and
spend the rest of her life drawing and painting street scenes.</p>

<p>A door led to a small porch that led to the backyard, which was
covered with gravel and used for parking.</p>

<p>As usual, he unloaded his backpack and started his homework, which
had to be finished before dinner, according to a rather rigid rule
established by his parents when he was in the first grade. An asthma
condition kept Theo away from the team sports he longed to play, but it
also ensured straight A’s in school. Over the years, he had grudgingly
accepted the fact that his academic success was a good substitute for
the games he missed. He could play golf, though, and he and his father
teed off every Saturday morning at nine. There was a knock on the back
door. Judge, who kept a bed under the desk, growled softly. Sandy Coe
was also in the eighth grade at the middle school, but in a different
section. Theo knew him but not well. He was a pleasant boy who said
little. He needed to talk, and Theo welcomed him to his room. Sandy took
the only other chair, a folding one that Theo kept in a corner. When
they were both seated, the room was full. “Can we talk in private?“Sandy
asked. He seemed shy, and nervous.</p>
<p>“Sure. What’s up?“</p>
<p>“Well, I need some advice, I think. I’m really not sure about this,
but I gotta talk to someone.“Theo, the counselor, said, “I promise
anything you say is kept in secret.“</p>
<p>“Good. Well, my dad got laid off a few months ago, and, well, things
are pretty bad around the house.“He paused, waiting for Theo to say
something. “I’m sorry.“</p>
<p>“And last night my parents were having this real serious talk in the
kitchen, and I should not have been listening, but I couldn’t help it.
Do you know what foreclosure means?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“What is it?“</p>
<p>“There are a lot of foreclosures these days. It means that a person
who owns a home can’t make the mortgage payments and the bank wants to
take the house.“</p>
<p>“I don’t understand any of this.“</p>
<p>“Okay. It works like this.“Theo grabbed a paperback and placed it in
the center of his desk. “Let’s say that this is a house and you want to
buy it. It costs a hundred thousand dollars, and since you don’t have a
hundred thousand dollars, you go to the bank and borrow the money.“He
placed a textbook next to the paperback. “This is the bank.“</p>
<p>“Got it.“</p>
<p>“The bank loans you the hundred thousand, and now you’re able to buy
the house from whoever is selling it. You agree to pay the bank, say
five hundred dollars a month, for thirty years.“</p>
<p>“Thirty years?“</p>
<p>“Yep. That’s the typical deal. The bank charges an extra fee for
making the loan–it’s called interest–so each month you pay back part of
the hundred thousand plus a chunk for interest. It’s a good deal for
everybody. You get the house you want, and the bank makes money on the
interest. All is well until something happens and you can’t make the
monthly payments.“</p>
<p>“What’s a mortgage?“</p>
<p>“A deal like this is called a mortgage. The bank has a claim on the
house until the loan is paid off. When you fall behind on the monthly
payments, the bank has the right to come in and take the house. The bank
kicks you out, and it owns the house. That’s a foreclosure.“He placed
the textbook on top of the paperback, smothering it. “My mom was crying
when they were talking about moving out. We’ve lived there since I was
born.“Theo opened his laptop and turned it on. “It’s terrible,“he said.
“And it’s happening a lot these days.“Sandy lowered his head and
appeared to be devastated. “What’s your father’s name?“</p>
<p>“Thomas. Thomas Coe.“</p>
<p>“And your mother?“</p>
<p>“Evelyn.“</p>
<p>Theo pecked away. “What’s your address?“</p>
<p>“Eight fourteen Bennington.“</p>
<p>More pecking. They waited, then Theo said, “Oh boy.“</p>
<p>“What is it?“</p>
<p>“The bank is Security Trust, on Main Street. Fourteen years ago your
parents borrowed a hundred and twenty thousand for a thirty-year
mortgage. They have not made the monthly payments in four months.“</p>
<p>“Four months?“</p>
<p>“Yep.“</p>
<p>“All this stuff is online?“</p>
<p>“Yes, but not just anybody can find it.“</p>
<p>“How’d you find it?“</p>
<p>“There are ways. A lot of law offices pay a fee to gain access to
certain data. Plus, I know how to dig a little deeper.“Sandy sank even
lower and shook his head. “So we’re gonna lose our house?“</p>
<p>“Not exactly.“</p>
<p>“What do you mean? My dad’s not working.“</p>
<p>“There’s a way to stop the foreclosure, stiff-arm the bank, and keep
the house for a while, maybe until your dad goes back to work.“Sandy
looked thoroughly bewildered. “You ever heard of bankruptcy?“Theo asked.
“I guess, but I don’t understand it.“</p>
<p>“It’s your only choice. Your parents will be forced to file for
bankruptcy protection. This means they hire a lawyer who’ll file some
papers in Bankruptcy Court on their behalf.“</p>
<p>“How much do lawyers cost?“</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that now. The important thing is to go see a
lawyer.“</p>
<p>“You can’t do it?“</p>
<p>“Sorry. And my parents are not bankruptcy lawyers. But there is a guy
two doors down, Steve Mozingo, and he’s very good. My parents send
clients to him. They like him a lot.“Sandy scribbled down the name. “And
you think we might get to keep our house?“</p>
<p>“Yes, but your parents need to see this guy as soon as possible.“</p>
<p>“Thanks, Theo. I don’t know what to say.“</p>
<p>“No problem. Happy to help.“Sandy hurried through the door, as if he
might sprint home with the good news. Theo watched him get on his bike
and disappear through the back parking lot. Another satisfied
client.</p>
<p>At fifteen minutes before 5:00 p.m., Mrs. Boone walked into Theo’s
office with a folder in one hand and a document in another. “Theo,“she
said, her reading glasses halfway down her nose. “Would you run these
over to Family Court and get them filed before five?“</p>
<p>“Sure, Mom.“</p>
<p>Theo was on his feet, reaching for his backpack. He had been hoping
that from some corner of the firm someone would need something filed in
the courthouse. “Your homework is finished, isn’t it?“</p>
<p>“Yes. I didn’t have much.“</p>
<p>“Good. And today is Monday. You’ll pay a visit to Ike, won’t you? It
means a lot to him.“</p>
