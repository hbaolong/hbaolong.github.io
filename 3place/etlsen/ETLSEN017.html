<h4 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h4>
<p>It was almost 1:00 p.m. when Judge Gantry yanked open the door to his
office and walked straight to the Boones as they sat like naughty
schoolchildren waiting in the principal’s office. He wore no robe, no
jacket, just a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, the tie loosened,
the look of a man hard at work and under pressure. He did not smile and
was clearly irritated.</p>
<p>The Boones jumped to their feet. There were no Helios or greetings of
any nature. Judge Gantry just said, “This better be good.“</p>
<p>“Sorry, Judge,“ Mr. Boone managed to say first. “We understand what’s
happening right now and realize the strain you’re under.“</p>
<p>“Our apologies, Henry,“ Mrs. Boone added quickly. “But it’s a crucial
matter that might impact this trial.“</p>
<p>By calling him Henry instead of Judge or something more formal,
Mrs. Boone managed to cool things a bit. Regardless of how irritated the
judge might appear, she was not the least bit intimidated.</p>
<p>“Just five minutes,“ she added as she picked up her purse.</p>
<p>Judge Gantry glared at Theo as if he’d just shot someone, then he
looked at Ike, managed a brief smile, and said, “Hello, Ike. It’s been a
long time.“</p>
<p>“Yes it has, Henry,“ Ike said.</p>
<p>The smile was gone, and Judge Gantry said, “You have five
minutes.“</p>
<p>They quickly followed him back into his office, and as the door was
closing Theo glanced back at Mrs. Irma Hardy. She was typing away, as if
she had no interest in what was about to be discussed. Theo figured she
would know everything within half an hour.</p>
<p>The four Boones lined up in chairs on one side of a long worktable in
one corner of the huge office. Judge Gantry faced them on the other.
Theo sat between his parents, and though he was quite nervous he also
felt well protected.</p>
<p>His mother went first. “Henry, we have reason to believe that there
is a witness to the murder of Myra Duffy. A witness who is hiding. A
witness unknown to the police, the prosecutors, and certainly to the
defense.“</p>
<p>“May I ask why Theo is in the middle of this?“ the judge asked, his
eyebrows arched and twitching. “Seems to me he should be in school right
about now. This is not exactly a matter for a child.“</p>
<p>First, Theo actually preferred to be in school at that moment.
Second, the use of the word child really irritated him. Theo said,
slowly, “Because, Judge, I know who the witness is. They don’t, but I
do.“</p>
<p>Judge Gantry’s eyes were red and he looked very tired. He exhaled, a
long, impressive release of air, much like an inner tube finally being
relieved of too much pressure. The thick wrinkles in his forehead
flattened and relaxed. He asked, “And what’s your role in all this,
Ike?“</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m just Theo’s legal adviser.“ Ike thought it was funny but the
humor was lost on the rest of them.</p>
<p>A pause, then, “Okay, why don’t we start at the beginning? I’d like
to know what this witness allegedly saw. Who can tell me this?“</p>
<p>“I can,“ Theo said. “But I promised I would never reveal his
name.“</p>
<p>“You promised this to whom?“</p>
<p>“To the witness.“</p>
<p>“So you’ve talked to this witness?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“And you believe he’s telling the truth?“</p>
<p>“I do, yes, sir.“</p>
<p>Another release of air. Another rub of the eyes. “All right, Theo.
I’m listening. Please move things along.“</p>
<p>Theo told the story.</p>
<p>When he finished, the room was silent. Judge Gantry slowly reached
over to a phone on the table, pushed a button, and said, “Mrs. Hardy,
please inform the bailiff that I will be delayed for thirty minutes.
Keep the jurors in the jury room.“</p>
<p>A crisp voice answered, “Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>He fell back into his chair. All four Boones watched him but he
avoided their gaze.</p>
<p>“And you have the gloves?“ he said, his voice much lower, much
calmer.</p>
<p>“They’re in our office,“ Mr. Boone said. “We’ll be happy to hand them
over.“</p>
<p>Judge Gantry raised both hands, both palms visible. “No, no. Not yet
anyway. Maybe later, maybe never. Just let me think for a moment.“ And
with that, he slowly got to his feet and walked to the window behind his
massive desk at the other end of the room. He stood there for a moment,
looking out, though there wasn’t much of a view. He seemed to forget
that just down the hall there was a courtroom full of people and they
were all anxiously waiting on him.</p>
<p>“Did I do okay?“ Theo whispered to his mother. She smiled, patted his
arm, and said, “Nice job, Teddy. Smile.“</p>
<p>The judge was back, in his chair, across the table. He looked at Theo
and asked, “Why won’t this person come forward?“</p>
<p>Theo hesitated because if he said too much more, he might compromise
the identity of Julio’s cousin. Ike decided to help. “Judge, the witness
is an illegal immigrant, one of many around here. He’s skittish right
now, and you can’t blame him. Any whiff of trouble, and he’ll vanish
into the underground and be gone forever.“</p>
<p>Theo added, “He thinks he’ll be arrested if he comes forward.“</p>
<p>Ike added, “And Theo promised the guy he wouldn’t tell a soul.“</p>
<p>Mr. Boone added, “But he thinks it’s important to inform the court
that a crucial witness is missing from the trial.“</p>
<p>Mrs. Boone added, “While at the same time protecting the identity of
the witness.“</p>
<p>“All right, all right,“ Judge Gantry said, and glanced at his watch.
“I can’t stop the trial at this point. We’re almost ready for the jury
to begin deliberations. If a surprise witness appeared now, it would be
difficult to stop the trial and allow him to testify. And we don’t even
have a surprise witness. We have a phantom witness. I can’t stop the
trial.“</p>
<p>These words echoed around the room and fell heavily onto the table.
All Theo could think about was Mr. Duffy sitting with all his lawyers,
smug and confident that he was about to get away with murder.</p>
<p>“Judge, can I make a suggestion?“ Ike asked.</p>
<p>“Sure, Ike. I could use some help.“</p>
<p>“Gossip is that you’re going to hold court tomorrow, on Saturday, and
wait on a verdict.“</p>
<p>“That’s right.“</p>
<p>“Why not send the jury home until Monday, like most trials? Bring
them back Monday morning to start their deliberations. This is a trial,
not emergency surgery. Things aren’t that urgent.“</p>
<p>“So what’s your plan?“</p>
<p>“I don’t have one. But it would give us some time to think about this
witness, maybe find a way to help him. I don’t know. It just seems wrong
to rush to a verdict, especially a verdict that might be wrong.“</p>
<p>“Wrong?“</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve watched some of the trial. I’ve watched the jurors. The
State started with a weak case and it’s gotten even weaker. Pete Duffy
is about to walk.“</p>
<p>Judge Gantry nodded slightly, as if he agreed, but he said nothing.
He began getting ready: He buttoned his cuffs, adjusted his tie, stood
and reached for his black robe hanging near the door.</p>
<p>“I’ll think about it,“ he said, finally. “Thank you for your, uh . .
.“</p>
<p>“Intrusion,“ said Mr. Boone with a laugh. The Boones were pushing
back and standing up.</p>
<p>“No, not at all, Woods. This presents a unique situation, something
I’ve never encountered before. But then, every trial is different. Thank
you, Theo.“</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Honor.“</p>
<p>“Are you watching the rest of the trial?“</p>
<p>“We can’t get a seat,“ Theo said.</p>
<p>“Well, let me see what I can do about that.“</p>
