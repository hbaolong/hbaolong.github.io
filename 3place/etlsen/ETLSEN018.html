<h4 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h4>
<p>When the jurors had taken their seats and the courtroom was quiet and
all eyes were on Judge Gantry, he said, “Mr. Nance, I believe you have
one more witness.“ Clifford Nance stood, straight and important, and
said, with drama, “Your Honor, the defense calls Mr. Peter Duffy
himself.“</p>
<p>The tension was suddenly thick as the defendant made his way to the
witness chair. Finally, after four long days of trial, the accused would
take the stand and tell his side of the story. But, in doing so he would
also subject himself to questions from the prosecution. Theo knew that
in 65 percent of murder cases the defendant does not testify, and he
knew the reasons why. First, they’re usually guilty of the murder and
cannot withstand a clever and nasty cross examination from the
prosecution. Second, they usually have a record of prior criminal
activity, and once on the witness stand the record becomes fair game. In
every trial the judge tries to explain to the jury that the defendant
does not have to testify, does not have to say a word nor produce any
witnesses on his behalf. The burden is on the State to prove him
guilty.</p>
<p>Theo also knew that jurors are very suspicious of a defendant who
will not testify to save his own neck. If they were suspicious of Pete
Duffy, Theo could not tell. They watched him closely as he settled into
the witness chair, raised his right hand, and swore to tell the
truth.</p>
<p>Theo could see it all because, thanks to Judge Gantry, he was sitting
in a ringside seat in the second row, behind the defense, with Ike to
his right and his father to his left. His mother had appointments back
at the office. She said she couldn’t waste the afternoon sitting through
a trial, though it was obvious to the other three Boones that she really
wanted to.</p>
<p>Clifford Nance cleared his throat and asked the defendant to state
his name, a necessary but rather silly thing to do under the
circumstances. Everyone in the courtroom not only knew Pete Duffy, but
also knew a lot about him. Mr. Nance then began a series of simple
questions. He took his time establishing the basics–Mr. Duffy’s family
history, education, jobs, businesses, lack of criminal record, and so
on. The two had spent hours rehearsing all this, and the witness settled
into a routine. He often glanced over at the jurors in an effort to
establish an easy conversational tone. Trust me, he seemed to be trying
to say. He was a nice-looking man in a stylish suit, and this struck
Theo as a little odd because none of the five male jurors wore a coat or
a tie. Theo had read articles about the strategy of what lawyers and
their clients should wear during a trial.</p>
<p>The back-and-forth finally got around to something important when
Mr. Nance brought up the subject of the million insurance policy on the
life of Mrs. Myra Duffy. The witness explained that he was a firm
believer in life insurance, that when he was a young man with a young
wife and young children he had always saved his money and invested in
life insurance, both for himself and for his wife. Life policies are
valuable tools to protect a family in the event of an untimely death.
Later, when he married his second wife, Myra, he had insisted on
purchasing life insurance. And Myra agreed. In fact, the million
policies had actually been her idea. She wanted the protection in case
something happened to him.</p>
<p>Though he seemed unable to completely relax, Mr. Duffy was
believable. The jurors listened carefully. So did Theo, and more than
once he reminded himself that he was watching the biggest trial in
Strattenburg’s history. Plus, he was also skipping school, with an
excuse.</p>
<p>From the life insurance, Mr. Nance moved the conversation to
Mr. Duffy’s business ventures. And here, the witness scored well. He
admitted that some of his real estate deals had gone sour, that some of
the banks were squeezing him, that he’d lost a few partners and made
some mistakes. His humility was touching and well received by the
jurors. It made him even more believable. He strongly denied that he was
even remotely close to bankruptcy, and rattled off an impressive series
of steps he was taking to unload debt and save his assets.</p>
<p>Some of it was over Theo’s head, and he suspected a few of the jurors
were slightly confused, too. It didn’t matter. Clifford Nance had his
client thoroughly prepared.</p>
<p>Under the State’s theory, the motive for the killing was money and
greed. This theory was looking weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>Mr. Nance then moved to the delicate matter of the Duffys’ marital
troubles, and here again the witness did a fine job. He admitted things
had been rocky. Yes, they had gone to marriage counselors. Yes, they had
consulted separate divorce lawyers. Yes, there had been fights, but none
violent. And yes, he had moved out on one occasion, a miserable
one-month period that made him even more determined to patch things up.
At the time she was killed, they were together and happy and making
plans for the future.</p>
<p>Another whack at the prosecution’s theory.</p>
<p>As the afternoon wore on, Clifford Nance steered the testimony to the
subject of golf, and there they spent a lot of time. Too much time, in
Theo’s humble opinion. Mr. Duffy was adamant in his assertions that he
had always preferred to play golf alone and had been doing so for
decades. Mr. Nance produced a file and explained to the judge that it
contained his client’s scorecards that dated back twenty years. He
handed one to the witness, who identified it. It was from a golf course
in California, fourteen years earlier. He had shot an eighty-one, nine
over par. He’d played alone.</p>
<p>One scorecard followed another, and the testimony soon became a tour
of golf courses all over the United States. Pete Duffy played a lot of
golf! He was serious. He kept his records. And he played alone. He went
on to explain that he also played with friends, played for business,
even played with his son every chance he got. But he preferred to play
alone, on an empty course.</p>
<p>When the tour was over, there seemed little doubt that another of the
prosecution’s theories had been shot down. The notion that Pete Duffy
had been planning the murder for two years, and that he began playing
golf alone so he could pull it off with no witnesses around, seemed
unlikely.</p>
<p>Theo kept thinking: There are four people in this crowded courtroom
who know the truth. Me, Ike, my dad, and Pete Duffy. We know he killed
his wife.</p>
<p>Ike kept thinking: This guy’s about to walk and there’s nothing we
can do. It’s the perfect crime.</p>
<p>Woods Boone kept thinking: How can we find the mysterious witness and
bring him in before it’s too late?</p>
<p>The last scorecard was from the day of the murder. Mr. Duffy had
played eighteen holes, shot six over par, and played alone. Of course,
the scorecard had been kept by him, so its accuracy could be
questioned.</p>
<p>(Theo had already learned that, in golf, most scorecards reflect
something other than the actual number of strokes.)</p>
<p>Mr. Nance became much more somber when he questioned his client about
the day of the murder, and his client responded well. Mr. Duffy’s voice
grew quieter, sort of scratchy and pained as he talked about his wife’s
brutal death.</p>
<p>I wonder if he’s going to cry, Theo was asking himself, though he was
moved by the testimony.</p>
<p>Pete Duffy held off the tears and did a superb job of describing the
horror of hearing the news, racing home in his golf cart, and finding
the police there. His wife’s body had not been moved, and when he saw
her he collapsed and had to be assisted by a detective. Later, he was
seen by a doctor and given some medication.</p>
<p>What a liar, Theo thought. What a phony. You killed your wife. There
is a witness. I have your gloves hidden at the office.</p>
<p>Pete Duffy talked about the nightmare of calling her family, his
family, their friends, and planning and enduring the funeral and burial.
The loneliness. The emptiness of living in the same house where his dear
wife had been murdered. The thoughts of selling it and moving away. The
daily trips to the cemetery.</p>
<p>Then, the horror of being suspected, accused, indicted, arrested, and
put on trial. How could anyone suspect him in the murder of a woman he
loved and adored?</p>
<p>He finally broke down. He struggled to control himself and wiped his
eyes and repeatedly said, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.“ It was very moving,
and Theo watched the faces of the jurors. Total sympathy and belief.
Duffy was crying to save his life, and it was working.</p>
<p>As his client tried to regain his composure, Clifford Nance decided
they had scored enough. He announced, “No more questions, Your Honor. We
tender the witness.“</p>
<p>Mr. Jack Hogan stood immediately and said, “May I suggest a short
recess, Your Honor?“ A recess would break the action, take the jurors
away from the emotional testimony they had just heard. And, it was just
after three thirty. Everyone needed a break.</p>
<p>“Fifteen minutes,“ Judge Gantry said. “They we’ll start the
cross-examination.“</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes dragged into thirty. “He’s running out the clock,“
Ike said. “It’s Friday afternoon. Everyone’s tired. He’ll send the jury
home and come back Monday.“</p>
<p>“I don’t know,“ said Woods Boone. “He might want the final arguments
this afternoon.“</p>
<p>They were huddled in the hallway, near the soft drink machines. Other
little groups of spectators were waiting, watching the clocks on the
wall. Omar Cheepe appeared and needed something to drink. He put some
coins in a machine, made his selection while glancing at the Boones,
then retrieved the can from the dispenser.</p>
<p>Ike kept talking. “Hogan won’t touch him. He’s too slick.“</p>
<p>“The jury will find him not guilty in less than an hour,“ Woods
said.</p>
<p>“He’s walking,“ Theo added.</p>
<p>“I really need to get back to the office,“ Woods said.</p>
<p>“So do I,“ Ike added. Typical Boones.</p>
<p>Neither made a move because both wanted to see the end of the trial.
Theo was just glad they were together and having a discussion, a
rarity.</p>
<p>There was movement down the hall, and the crowd began to shuffle
toward the courtroom. A few had left during the recess. It was, after
all, Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>When they were inside and seated again, and quiet, Judge Gantry
assumed his position on the bench and nodded at Jack Hogan. It was time
for the cross-examination, and when a defendant was on the stand and a
prosecutor had the right to question him aggressively, the result was
usually pretty ugly.</p>
<p>Jack Hogan walked to the witness stand and handed Pete Duffy a
document. “Recognize this, Mr. Duffy?“ Hogan asked, suspicion dripping
from every syllable.</p>
<p>Duffy took his time, looked it over, front and back, for several
pages. “Yes,“ he finally said.</p>
<p>“Please tell the jury what it is?“</p>
<p>“It’s a foreclosure notice.“</p>
<p>“On which property?“</p>
<p>“Rix Road Shopping Center.“</p>
<p>“Here in Strattenburg?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“And the Rix Road Shopping Center is owned by you?“</p>
<p>“Yes, me and a partner.“</p>
<p>“And the bank sent you that foreclosure notice in September of last
year because you were behind in the quarterly payments on the mortgage.
Is that correct?“</p>
<p>“That’s what the bank said.“</p>
<p>“Do you disagree, Mr. Duffy? Are you telling this jury that you were
not behind in the mortgage payments on this property in September of
last year?“ Jack Hogan waved some more papers as he asked this, as if he
had plenty of proof.</p>
<p>Duffy paused, then offered a fake grin. “Yes, we were behind in the
payments.“</p>
<p>“And the bank had loaned you how much money on this property?“</p>
<p>“Two hundred thousand dollars.“</p>
<p>“Two hundred thousand dollars,“ Hogan repeated as he looked at the
jurors. Then he walked to his table, put down one handful of papers and
picked up another. He situated himself behind the podium and said, “Now,
Mr. Duffy, did you own a warehouse on Wolf Street in the industrial park
here in Strattenburg?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. I had two partners in that deal.“</p>
<p>“And you sold the warehouse, didn’t you?“</p>
<p>“Yes, we sold it.“</p>
<p>“And the sale took place last September, right?“</p>
<p>“If you say so. Tm sure you have the paperwork.“</p>
<p>“Indeed I do. And my paperwork shows that the warehouse was on the
market for over a year, that the asking price was six hundred thousand
dollars, the mortgage at State Bank was five hundred fifty, and that you
and your partners finally sold it for just over four hundred thousand.“
Hogan was sort of thrusting the paperwork in the air as he spoke. “You
agree, Mr. Duffy?“</p>
<p>“That sounds about right.“</p>
<p>“So you lost a chunk of money on that deal, right, Mr. Duffy?“</p>
<p>“It was not one of my better deals.“</p>
<p>“Were you desperate to sell the warehouse?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Did you need the cash, Mr. Duffy?“</p>
<p>The witness shifted weight and seemed a bit uncomfortable. “We, my
partners and I, needed to sell the warehouse.“</p>
<p>For the next twenty minutes, Hogan hammered away at Pete Duffy and
his partners and their financial woes. Duffy refused to admit that he
had been desperate. But, as the cross-examination grew stressful, it
became obvious that the witness had been scrambling to prop up one deal
while another fell through. Hogan had plenty of paperwork. He produced
copies of two lawsuits that had been filed against Pete Duffy by
ex-partners. He grilled the witness about the allegations in the
lawsuits. Duffy adamantly denied he was at fault and explained that
neither case had merit. He freely admitted that his business had been
struggling, but clung to the position that he had been far from
bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Jack Hogan did a masterful job of portraying Duffy as a cash-starved
wheeler-dealer who barely managed to stay one step ahead of his
creditors. But linking his problems to the motive for murder was still a
stretch.</p>
<p>Changing subjects, Hogan began to position himself for another bomb.
He politely poked around the issue of the Duffys’ troubled marriage, and
after a few easy questions, asked, “Now, Mr. Duffy, you testified that
you actually moved out, is that correct?“</p>
<p>“It is.“</p>
<p>“And this separation lasted for one month?“</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t call it a separation. We never referred to it as
that.“</p>
<p>“Then what was it called?“</p>
<p>“We didn’t bother to give it a name, sir.“</p>
<p>“Fair enough. When did you move out?“</p>
<p>“I didn’t keep a journal, but it was July of last year.“</p>
<p>“ Roughly three months before her murder?“</p>
<p>“Something like that.“</p>
<p>“Where did you live after you moved out?“</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I actually moved, sir. I just took some clothes and
left.“</p>
<p>“Okay, and where did you go?“</p>
<p>“I spent a few nights at the Marriott, just down the street. I spent
a few nights with one of my partners. He’s divorced and lives alone. It
was a pretty lousy month.“</p>
<p>“So you were just here and there? For about a month?“</p>
<p>“That’s right.“</p>
<p>“Then you moved back home, patched things up with Mrs. Duffy, and
were in the process of living happily ever after when she was
murdered?“</p>
<p>“Is that a question?“</p>
<p>“Strike it. Here’s a question for you, Mr. Duffy.“ Jack Hogan was
back with the paperwork. He handed a document to the witness, and with
one glance Pete Duffy became pale.</p>
<p>“Recognize that, Mr. Duffy?“</p>
<p>“Uh, I’m not sure,“ Duffy said, flipping a page, trying to stall.</p>
<p>“Well, allow me to help. That’s a four-page lease for an apartment
over in Weeksburg, thirty miles away. The lease is for a nice,
two-bedroom furnished apartment in a swanky building, two thousand
dollars a month. Ring a bell, Mr. Duffy?“</p>
<p>“Not really. I, uh–“</p>
<p>“A one-year lease, beginning last June.“</p>
<p>Duffy shrugged as if he had no clue. “It’s not signed by me.“</p>
<p>“No, but by your secretary, a Mrs. Judith Maze, a woman who’s lived
with her husband at the same address here in Strattenburg for the past
twenty years. Right, Mr. Duffy?“</p>
<p>“If you say so. She is my secretary.“</p>
<p>“Why would she sign a lease for such an apartment?“</p>
<p>“I have no idea. Maybe you should ask her.“</p>
<p>“Mr. Duffy, do you really want me to call her as a witness?“</p>
<p>“Uh, sure. Go ahead.“</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen this apartment, Mr. Duffy?“</p>
<p>Duffy was rattled and dazed and clinging to a slippery slope. He
glanced at the jury box, offered another fake smile, then replied, “Yes,
I’ve stayed there a couple of times.“</p>
<p>“Alone?“ Hogan barked with perfect timing and great suspicion.</p>
<p>“Of course I was alone. I was over there on business, things ran
late, so I stayed in the apartment.“</p>
<p>“How convenient. Who’s paying the rent?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know. You’ll have to ask Mrs. Maze.“</p>
<p>“So you’re telling the jury, Mr. Duffy, that you did not lease this
apartment and you’re not paying the rent?“</p>
<p>“That’s correct.“</p>
<p>“And you’ve only stayed there a couple of times?“</p>
<p>“That’s correct.“</p>
<p>“And the leasing of this apartment had nothing to do with the
problems you and Mrs. Duffy were having?“</p>
<p>“No. Again, I didn’t lease the apartment.“</p>
<p>To Theo, who knew the truth, Pete Duffy’s honesty had been severely
questioned. It seemed obvious that he was lying about the apartment. And
if he told one lie, then he would certainly tell another.</p>
<p>Evidently, Jack Hogan had no way to prove how often Duffy had used
the apartment. He moved on, to the subject of golf, and his
cross-examination lost its steam. Duffy knew much more about golf than
the prosecutor, and the two haggled and bickered for what seemed like an
hour.</p>
<p>It was almost 6:00 p.m. when Jack Hogan finally sat down. Judge
Gantry wasted no time before announcing, “I have decided not to hold
court tomorrow. I think the jurors need a break. I hope you have a quiet
and restful weekend, and I’ll see you here at nine Monday morning. At
that time, we will have closing arguments, then you will finally get the
case. Again, the usual instructions. Do not discuss this case. If anyone
contacts you and attempts to discuss this case, please notify me
immediately. Thank you for your service. I’ll see you Monday.“</p>
<p>The bailiffs escorted the jurors through a side door. Once they were
gone, Judge Gantry looked at the lawyers and said, “Gentlemen, anything
more?“</p>
<p>Jack Hogan stood and said, “Nothing at this time, Your Honor.“</p>
<p>Clifford Nance stood and shook his head no.</p>
<p>“Very well. This court is adjourned until nine Monday morning.“</p>
