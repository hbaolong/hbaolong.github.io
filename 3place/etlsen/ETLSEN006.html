<h4 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h4>
<p>Judge Henry Gantry tugged on the right sleeve of his long black robe
to adjust it properly, then stepped through the massive oak door behind
the bench of his courtroom. A bailiff suddenly yelled, “All rise for the
Court!“ Everyone–spectators, jurors, lawyers, clerks, all the
participants in the trial–bolted to their feet in one scramble. As Judge
Gantry was establishing himself in his thronelike chair, the bailiff
quickly rattled off his standard call to order: “Hear ye, hear ye, the
Criminal Court of the Tenth District is now in session, the Honorable

bless this Court.“</p>

<p>“Please be seated,“ Judge Gantry said loudly into the microphone
before him. <strong>Just as suddenly as the crowd had jumped to its

squeaked. Benches cracked. Purses and briefcases were rearranged, and

everything was quiet.</p>

<p>Theo had been unable to eat breakfast, and he’d slept little.
<strong>He’d read many stories of athletes who were so nervous they
couldn’t eat or sleep before a big game.</strong> They were overcome
with butterflies, queasy stomachs brought on by fear and pressure. Theo
could certainly feel the pressure right now. The air in the courtroom
was heavy and tense. Though he was only a spectator, he had the
butterflies. This was the big game.</p>

<p>Mr. Hogan was a career prosecutor who handled the major cases in
Strattenburg. He was tall, wiry, bald, and wore a black suit every day.
Behind his back folks joked about his black suits. No one knew if he had
only one or a couple dozen. Though he rarely smiled, he began his
opening statement with a friendly “good morning“ and introduced himself
and the two younger prosecutors at his table. He did a nice job of
breaking the ice.</p>

<p>Then he got down to business. He introduced the victim, Myra Duffy,
by showing the jury a large color portrait of her. “She was only
forty-six years old when she was murdered,“ he said gravely. “The mother
of two sons, Will and Clark, both college students. I’d like for them to
stand.“ He pointed to the front row, directly behind the prosecution’s
table, and the two young men stood awkwardly. and looked at the
jurors.</p>

<p>Theo knew from the newspaper reports that their father, her first
husband, had been killed in a plane crash when they were little boys.
Mr. Duffy was her second husband, and she was his second wife.</p>
<p>People liked to say that there was a lot of remarrying “out at The
Creek.“</p>
<p>Mr. Hogan was describing the crime. Mrs. Duffy had been found in the
living room of the large contemporary home she shared with Mr. Duffy. It
was a new home, less than three years old, and it was on a wooded lot
that backed up to the golf course. Because of all the trees, the house
was barely visible from the street, but then the same could be said of
most of the homes at Waverly Creek. Privacy was important out there.</p>
<p>When her body was found, the front door of their home was unlocked
and slightly open. The alarm system was in Standby mode. Someone had
taken her jewelry from her closet, a set of antique watches owned by
Mr. Duffy, and three handguns from a drawer by the television in the
den. The estimated value of the missing loot was about thirty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>The cause of death was strangulation. With the approval of Judge
Gantry, Mr. Hogan stepped to a projector, hit a button, and a large
color photo appeared on a screen opposite the jury. It showed Mrs. Duffy
lying on the carpeted floor, well dressed, seemingly untouched, her
high-heeled shoes still on her feet. Mr. Hogan explained that on the day
she was murdered, a Thursday, she’d had a luncheon date at noon with her
sister. Apparently, she was ready to leave the house when she was
attacked and killed. Her murderer then went through the house, took the
items that were missing, and left. Her sister began calling Mrs. Duffy’s
cell phone, ten calls over the next two hours, and became concerned
enough that she drove to Waverly Creek, to the Duffy home, and found her
sister. As far as crime scenes go, this one looked rather peaceful. The
victim could’ve simply fainted. At first, her sister and the police
thought she had died of a heart attack or a stroke or some other natural
cause. But given her age, fitness, and no history of drug abuse, they
quickly became suspicious.</p>
<p>An autopsy revealed the true cause of death. The person who killed
Mrs. Duffy grabbed her from behind and pressed firmly on her carotid
artery. Mr. Hogan placed his fingers against his own carotid artery, on
the right side of his neck.,¦</p>
<p>“Ten seconds of firm pressure in just the right place and you lose
consciousness,“ he said, then waited while everyone else waited to see
if he might just collapse himself right there in open court. He did not.
He continued, “Once Mrs. Duffy passed out, her killer kept pressing,
firmer and firmer, and sixty seconds later she was dead. There are no
signs of struggle–no broken fingernails, no scratches, nothing. Why?
Because Mrs. Duffy knew the man who killed her.“ Mr. Hogan dramatically
turned and glared at Mr. Duffy, who was seated between Clifford Nance
and another defense lawyer.</p>
<p>“She knew him because she was married to him.“</p>
<p>There was a long, heavy pause as the entire courtroom looked at
Mr. Duffy. Theo could see the back of his head. He wanted desperately to
see his face. Mr. Hogan continued, “He was able to get so close because
she trusted him.“</p>
<p>Mr. Hogan stood by the projector and displayed more photographs.
Using them, he laid out the entire scene–the interior of the house, the
front door, the rear door, the close proximity to the golf course. He
used a photo of the main entrance of Waverly Creek, with its heavy gates
and guardhouse and security cameras. He explained that it was highly
unlikely that an intruder, even a clever one, could breach all that
security. Unless, of course, the intruder was not really an intruder
because he lived there, too.</p>
<p>None of the neighbors saw a strange vehicle leave the Duffy home. No
one saw a stranger walking the streets, or running from the house.
Nothing unusual was reported. In the past six years, there had been only
two home burglaries at Waverly Creek. Crime was virtually unheard of in
this quiet community.</p>
<p>On the day of the murder, Mr. Duffy played golf, something he did
almost every Thursday. He teed off at 11:10 a.m., according to the
computer log in the golf shop. He was alone, which was not unusual, and,
as always, he used his own electric golf cart. He told the course
starter that he planned to play eighteen holes, the North Nine and the
South Nine, the two most popular courses. The Duffy home bordered the
sixth fairway of the Creek Course, a smaller course preferred by the
ladies.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy was a serious golfer who always kept score and didn’t
cheat. Playing eighteen holes alone usually took about three hours. The
day was overcast, cool, and windy– weather that would discourage most
people from playing golf. Other than a foursome that had teed off at ten
twenty, there was no one else on any of the three courses at eleven ten.
Another foursome teed off at one forty.</p>
<p>Mrs. Duffy’s sister found her and immediately called 911. The call
was recorded at 2:14 p.m. The autopsy placed her time of death at around
eleven forty-five.</p>
<p>With the help of an assistant, Mr. Hogan set up a large diagram of
the Waverly Creek community. He identified the three golf courses, the
golf shop, driving range, tennis courts, and other points of interest,
then he showed the jury the location of the Duffy home on the Creek
Course. According to tests the State had performed, Mr. Duffy was either
on the fourth or fifth hole of the North Nine at the time of his wife’s
murder. Riding in a golf cart identical to the one owned by Mr. Duffy, a
person could travel from that part of the course to the Duffy home on
the sixth fairway in about eight minutes.</p>
<p>Peter Duffy looked at the diagram and slowly shook his head as if
Mr. Hogan was full of nonsense. He was forty nine years old with a dark,
scowling face topped by thick, graying hair. He wore horn-rimmed
glasses, a brown suit, and could easily have been mistaken for one of
the lawyers.</p>
<p>Jack Hogan drove home the point that Mr. Duffy knew</p>
<p>I his wife was home, obviously had access to his own house, was in a
golf cart only minutes away at the time of the murder, and was playing
golf at a time when the course was practically deserted. His chances of
being seen were slim.</p>
<p>“He planned it very well,“ Mr. Hogan said, over and over.</p>
<p>The mere fact that a good lawyer kept saying that Mr. Duffy killed
his wife made his theory sound believable. Repeat something enough and
folks will start to believe it. Mr. Mount had always taken the position
that the presumption of innocence is a joke nowadays. The presumption is
one of guilt. And, Theo had to admit, it was difficult to think of
Mr. Duffy in terms of innocence, at least in the opening minutes of the
trial.</p>
<p>Why would Mr. Duffy kill his wife? Mr. Hogan posed this question to
the jury in such a way that it was obvious he had the answer.</p>
<p>“Money, ladies and gentlemen.“ With great drama, he snatched a
document from his table and announced, “This is a life insurance policy
for one million dollars purchased by Mr. Peter Duffy two years ago
insuring the life of his late wife, Myra Duffy.“</p>
<p>Dead silence. The guilt seemed to grow heavier.</p>
<p>Mr. Hogan flipped through the policy as he discussed it, and seemed
to lose some steam. When he was finished with it, he tossed it back on
his table, then launched into a rambling discussion of Mr. Duffy’s
business woes. He was a real estate developer who had scored big, lost
big, and at the time of his wife’s death was being squeezed by some
banks. Mr. Hogan promised the jury that the State would prove that the
defendant, Peter Duffy, was on the verge of going broke.</p>
<p>Thus, he needed cash. As in life insurance money.</p>
<p>There was more on the subject of motive. Mr. Hogan said that the jury
would learn that the Duffy marriage had not been a happy one. There had
been problems, and lots of them. They had separated on at least two
occasions. Both had hired divorce lawyers, though neither had ever filed
for divorce.</p>
<p>To wrap things up, Mr. Hogan stood as close as possible to the jurors
and gave them a serious look. “This was a cold-blooded murder, ladies
and gentlemen. Perfectly planned and carefully executed. Not a hitch. No
witnesses, no evidence left behind. Nothing but a lovely young woman
brutally choked to death.“ Mr. Hogan suddenly closed his eyes, tapped
the side of his head, said, “Oh, I forgot something. I forgot to tell
you that two years ago when Mr. Duffy bought the life insurance policy,
he also began playing golf alone. He’d seldom played alone before then,
and we’ll bring in witnesses to prove it. Isn’t that a coincidence? He
planned this for two years. Quietly fitting his golf game around his
wife’s schedule, just waiting. Waiting for a cold and windy day so the
course would be empty. Waiting for the perfect moment to sprint home,
park his cart next to the patio, hustle through the back door, “Hi,
honey, I’m home,“ then grab her when she wasn’t looking. One minute
later, she’s dead. He’d planned this for so long, he knew just what to
do. He grabbed her jewelry, grabbed his expensive watches, and grabbed
the guns so the police would think it was the work of a burglar. Seconds
later he was out the door, back in the golf cart flying along the
fairways to number five on the North Nine, where he took a four iron,
casually hit a nice shot, and finished another lonely game of golf.“</p>
<p>Mr. Hogan paused. All was silent. He picked up his legal pad and
returned to his seat. Ninety minutes had passed. Judge Gantry rapped his
gavel and said, “Let’s take a ten minute recess.“</p>
<p>Mr. Mount gathered his class at the end of a narrow hallway on the
second floor. The boys were chatting excitedly about the drama they’d
just witnessed. “This is much better than television,“ one said.</p>
<p>“All right,“ Mr. Mount said, “you’ve heard only one side of the case.
Just for fun, though, how many think he’s guilty?“ At least a dozen
hands shot up. Theo wanted to vote yes for guilt, but he knew it was
premature. “What about the presumption of innocence?“ Mr. Mount asked.
“He did it,“ said Darren, the drummer. Several others voiced their
agreement. “He’s guilty,“ said Brian, the swimmer. “There’s no way he’s
getting off.“</p>
<p>“He planned it perfectly.“</p>
<p>“He did it.“</p>
<p>“Okay, okay,“ said Mr. Mount. “We’re going to have this same
conversation during the lunch break, after you’ve heard the other
side.“</p>
<p>The other side began with a bang. Clifford Nance waited until the
courtroom was quiet before he walked to the jury box. He was about sixty
with gray hair over his ears, a thick chest and arms, and a swagger that
seemed to say that he’d never backed down from a fight, in court or out.
“Not a shred of evidence!“ he boomed in a deep, husky voice that echoed
off the walls. “Not a shred of evidence!“ he boomed again, as if someone
could have missed it the first time. Theo caught himself flinching.</p>
<p>“Nothing! No witnesses. No crime-scene proof. Nothing but this clean,
neat, tidy little story Mr. Hogan has just shared with you, not one word
of which is evidence. Just his fanciful version of what maybe could have
happened. Maybe Pete Duffy wanted to kill his wife. Maybe he carefully
planned it all. Maybe he raced around an empty golf course. Maybe he
arrived at his home just in time to pull off one of the cleanest
killings in history. Then, maybe he stole some things, left the front
door open, raced away back to the fifth tee, and resumed his game. Maybe
that’s what happened.“</p>
<p>Mr. Nance was pacing now, slowly, before the jury, a perfect rhythm
to his words.</p>
<p>“Mr. Hogan is asking you, ladies and gentlemen, to play the Maybe
Game. Maybe this happened, maybe that happened. And he wants you to play
along because he has no proof. He has nothing. Nothing but a man playing
golf, alone, minding his own business, while his wife gets murdered in
their lovely home less than a mile away.“</p>
<p>He stopped pacing and walked closer to the jurors. He picked out an
elderly gentleman on the front row and seemed ready to pat him on the
knee. He lowered his voice and said, “I don’t really blame Mr. Hogan for
playing the Maybe Game. He really has no choice, and this is because he
has no evidence. He has nothing but a vivid imagination.“</p>
<p>Mr. Nance shuffled to his right and made eye contact with a
middle-aged housewife. “Our Constitution, our laws, our rules of
procedure, they’re all built on the ideas of fairness. And guess what?
There is absolutely no room for a bunch of ‘maybes.’ Our laws are clear.
Judge Gantry will explain them later, and when he does, please listen
carefully. You will not hear him utter the word maybe a single time.
What you will hear is the very well-known and time-honored and
old-fashioned American rule that says when the State accuses you of a
crime, the State must walk in here with all of its
resources–investigators, police, experts, prosecutors, crime-scene
analysts, all of these smart and experienced people–and prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that you did, in fact, commit the crime.“</p>
<p>Mr. Nance shuffled to his left and looked sincerely, and
convincingly, at the six jurors on the second row. He spoke with no
notes, his words smooth, almost effortless, as though he’d done this a
thousand times but had lost none of his passion.</p>
<p>“Beyond a reasonable doubt. Beyond a reasonable doubt. The State has
a heavy burden, one that it cannot possibly meet.“</p>
<p>He paused while everyone took a breath. He walked to the defense
table, picked up a yellow legal pad, but did not look at it. He was an
actor on center stage, and he knew his lines by heart. He cleared his
voice, then at full volume continued. “Now, the law says that Pete Duffy
does not have to testify, does not have to call witnesses in his
defense, does not have to prove anything. And why is this? Well, it’s
very simple. He is protected by one of our most cherished safeguards.
It’s called the presumption of innocence.“ Mr. Nance turned and pointed
at his client. “Pete Duffy sits here an innocent man, same as you, same
as me.“</p>
<p>He began pacing again, slowly, his eyes never leaving the eyes of the
jurors. “However, Pete Duffy will testify. He wants to testify. He can’t
wait to testify. And when he takes that seat right here, on the witness
stand, he will testify, under oath, and he will tell you the truth. The
truth, ladies and gentlemen, is something far different from the little
story Mr. Hogan just created. The truth, ladies and gentlemen, is that
Pete Duffy was indeed playing golf that fateful day, and he was alone,
his preferred way of playing. The records will reflect that he teed off
at eleven ten, drove away from the first tee in his own golf cart, one
that he keeps in his garage, as do most of his neighbors. He was on the
course, alone, while his wife was at home getting ready to leave for a
lunch in town. A thief, some unknown criminal who’s still at large and
will probably remain so at the rate we’re going, entered the house
quietly, and mistakenly thought no one was home. The alarm was off. The
front door was unlocked, as was the back door. This was not, is still
not, uncommon in this neighborhood. Unexpectedly, the thief encountered
Myra Duffy, attacked her with his hands because he had no weapon, and at
that point he became something else. He became a murderer.“</p>
<p>Mr. Nance paused and walked to the defense table, where he picked up
a glass of water and took a long drink. Everyone watched him. There was
nothing else to watch.</p>
<p>“And he’s still out there!“ he said suddenly, practically yelling.
“Or he could be here,“ he said, waving his arms, taking in the entire
courtroom. “Since we’re playing the Maybe Game, then maybe he’s here,
watching this trial. Why not? He’s certainly safe from Mr. Hogan and his
gang.“</p>
<p>Theo noticed that several of the jurors glanced toward the
spectators.</p>
<p>Mr. Nance shifted gears and talked about the life insurance policy,
and specifically the fact that Mr. Duffy had indeed purchased one that
made him the recipient of a million dollars in the event his wife died.
But, there had been an identical policy on his life naming Mrs. Duffy as
the recipient. They had simply done what most married couples do. They
had purchased dual policies. He promised to prove to the jury that Pete
Duffy’s business affairs were not nearly as dire as Mr. Hogan claimed.
He admitted that the Duffys had struggled with their marriage, and they
had separated on more than one occasion, but they had never filed for
divorce. In fact, they were determined to work through their
differences. Mr. Mount sat in the second row in the balcony, behind his
students. He chose his spot carefully so he could see all sixteen, if
necessary. So far they had been riveted by the opening statements. Not
surprisingly, Theo was more engaged than the others. He was exactly
where he wanted to be. When Mr. Nance finished, Judge Gantry called for
an early lunch recess.</p>
