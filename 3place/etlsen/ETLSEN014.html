<h4 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h4>
<p>After a long good-bye, Theo came back to Earth. He practically ran up
the stairs to the second floor, then to the balcony, where he found Ike
in the front row. He slid in beside him. It was almost 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>The witness was the insurance agent who’d sold the million policy to
the Duffys just over two years earlier. Clifford Nance was slowly
walking the agent through his dealings with the couple. He carefully
made the point that two policies were purchased, one insuring the life
of Mrs. Myra Duffy, and the other for Mr. Peter Duffy. Both were for
million. Both policies replaced existing policies that would pay 00,000
in the event of either death. There was nothing unusual about the
transaction. The agent testified that it was rather typical–a married
couple wisely increasing their coverage to protect each other in the
event of an untimely death. Both Duffys knew exactly what they were
doing and did not hesitate to upgrade their policies.</p>
<p>By the time Clifford Nance finished with the direct examination, the
million payoff sounded far less suspicious. Jack Hogan threw a few
punches on cross examination but nothing landed. When the agent was
finished, Judge Gantry decided to call it a day.</p>
<p>Theo watched the jury file out of the courtroom as everyone waited,
then he watched the defense team huddle around Pete Duffy and offer smug
smiles and a few handshakes for another productive day in court. They
were very confident. Omar Cheepe was not present.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to talk around here,“ Ike said in a low voice. “Can you
run by the office?“</p>
<p>“Sure.“</p>
<p>“Now?“</p>
<p>“I’m right behind you.“</p>
<p>Ten minutes later they were in Ike’s office with the door locked. Ike
opened a small refrigerator on the floor behind his desk. “I have
Budweiser and Sprite.“</p>
<p>“Budweiser,“ Theo said.</p>
<p>Ike gave him a Sprite and popped the top of a can of Bud for himself.
“Your options are limited,“ he said, then took a sip.</p>
<p>“I figured.“</p>
<p>“First, you can do nothing. Tomorrow is Friday, and it looks like the
defense will rest by midafternoon. Rumor is that Pete Duffy will
testify, and go last. The jury might even get the case by late
afternoon. If you do nothing, then the jury retires to the jury room and
considers its verdict. They can find him guilty, or not guilty, or they
can split and not be able to reach a verdict. A hung jury.“</p>
<p>Theo knew all this. In the past five years he’d watched far more
trials than Ike.</p>
<p>His uncle continued: “Second, you can go to this mysterious witness
and try to convince him to come forward immediately. I’m not sure what
Judge Gantry would do now if confronted with this kind of testimony. I’m
sure he’s never been in this position, but he’s a good judge and he’ll
do what’s right.“</p>
<p>“This guy is not about to come forward. He’s too scared.“</p>
<p>“Okay, that leads to your third option. You can go to the judge
anyway, and without revealing the name of the witness–“</p>
<p>“I don’t know his name.“</p>
<p>“But you know who he is, right?“</p>
<p>“Right.“</p>
<p>“Do you know where he lives?“</p>
<p>“The general area. I don’t know his address.“</p>
<p>“Do you know where he works?“</p>
<p>“Maybe.“</p>
<p>Ike stared at him as he took another sip from the can. He swiped his
lips with the back of a hand. “As I was saying, without revealing his
identity, explain to the judge that a crucial witness is missing from
this trial and his absence will likely lead to the wrong verdict. The
judge, of course, will want details: Who is he? Where does he work? How
did he become a witness? What, exactly, did he see? And so on. I suspect
Judge Gantry will have a thousand questions and if you don’t answer
them, then he might get upset.“</p>
<p>“I don’t like any of the three options,“ Theo said.</p>
<p>“Nor do I.“</p>
<p>“Then what should I do, Ike?“</p>
<p>“Leave it alone, Theo. Don’t stick your nose into this mess. It’s no
place for a kid. It’s no place for an adult. The jury is about to make
the wrong decision, but based on the evidence, you can’t blame them. The
system doesn’t always work, you know. Look at all the innocent people
who’ve been sent to death row. Look at the guilty people who get off.
Mistakes happen, Theo. Leave it alone.“</p>
<p>“But this mistake hasn’t happened yet, and it can be prevented.“</p>
<p>“I’m not sure it can be prevented. It’s highly unlikely that Judge
Gantry will stop a big trial that’s almost over just because he hears
about a potential witness. That’s a stretch, Theo.“</p>
<p>It did seem unlikely, and Theo had to agree. “I guess you’re
right.“</p>
<p>“Of course I’m right, Theo. You’re just a kid. Butt out.“</p>
<p>“Okay, Ike.“</p>
<p>There was a long pause as they stared at each other, waiting for the
other to speak. Finally, Ike said, “Promise me you won’t do something
stupid.“</p>
<p>“Like what?“</p>
<p>“Like to go the judge. I know you two are buddies.“</p>
<p>Another pause.</p>
<p>“Promise me, Theo.“</p>
<p>“I promise I won’t do anything before I talk with you.“</p>
<p>“Fair enough.“</p>
<p>Theo jumped to his feet. “I need to go. I have a lot of
homework.“</p>
<p>“How’s Spanish?“</p>
<p>“Great.“</p>
<p>“I hear that teacher is really something. Madame, what’s her
name?“</p>
<p>“Madame Monique. She’s very good. How do you know–“</p>
<p>“I keep up, Theo. I’m not some crazy recluse like everybody thinks.
Are they offering Chinese yet in this school system?“</p>
<p>“Maybe in the upper school.“</p>
<p>“I think you should start Chinese, on your own. It’s the language of
the future, Theo.“</p>
<p>Once again, he was irked that his uncle was so free to give advice
that was not asked for and certainly not needed. “I’ll think about it,
Ike. Right now I’m pretty loaded.“</p>
<p>“I might watch the trial tomorrow,“ Ike said. “I kind of enjoyed it
today. Text me.“</p>
<p>“You got it, Ike.“</p>
<p>Boone &amp; Boone was quiet when Theo made his appearance a few
minutes after 6:00 p.m. Elsa, Vince, and Dorothy were long gone.
Mrs. Boone was at home, no doubt skimming the pages of another bad
novel. Her book club would meet at seven, at the home of Mrs. Esther
Guthridge, for dinner and wine and a discussion of almost everything
except their book of the month. The club had ten women in all, and they
took turns selecting the books. Theo could not remember the last one
that his mother enjoyed, not even the ones she’d picked. Each month she
could be heard complaining about whatever book she was supposed to be
reading. It seemed an odd way to run a club, at least in Theo’s
opinion.</p>
<p>Woods Boone was stuffing his briefcase when Theo entered the upstairs
office. Theo often wondered why his father crammed files and books into
his briefcase and hauled it home every night as if he just might work
until midnight. He did not. He never worked at home, never touched the
briefcase, which he always placed under a table in the foyer near the
front door. And there it sat, all night, until Mr. Boone left early in
the morning for breakfast and then to the office, where he unpacked the
briefcase and flung its contents onto his terribly disorganized desk.
Theo suspected that the stuffing was always the same–same books, files,
papers.</p>
<p>He had noticed that lawyers seldom go anywhere without a briefcase.
Maybe to lunch. His mother hauled hers home, too, but she occasionally
unlatched it and read some of its contents.</p>
<p>“A good day at school?“ Mr. Boone asked.</p>
<p>“That’s good. Listen, Theo, your mother has book club tonight. I’m
going over to Judge Plankmore’s for a little while. The old guy is
fading fast and I need to sit with him for a couple of hours. Won’t be
long before there’s a funeral.“</p>
<p>“Sure, Dad. No problem.“</p>
<p>Judge Plankmore was at least ninety years old and dying from multiple
causes. He was a legend in the Strattenburg legal world and most of the
lawyers adored him.</p>
<p>“There’s some leftover spaghetti you can zap in the microwave.“</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine, Dad. Don’t worry. I’ll probably study here for an hour
or so, then go home. I’ll take care of Judge.“</p>
<p>“You’re sure?“</p>
<p>“No problem.“</p>
<p>Theo went to his office, unloaded his backpack, and was trying to
concentrate on his Chemistry homework when there was a slight knock on
the back door. It was Julio, for the second day in a row.</p>
<p>“Can we talk outside?“ he said, very nervous.</p>
<p>“Come on in,“ Theo said. “Everyone’s gone. We can talk in here.“</p>
<p>“Are you sure?“</p>
<p>“Yes. What’s up?“</p>
<p>Julio sat down. Theo closed the door.</p>
<p>“I talked with my cousin an hour ago. He’s very nervous. There were
policemen at the golf course today. He thinks you’ve told them about
him.“</p>
<p>“Come on, Julio. I haven’t told anyone. I swear it.“</p>
<p>“Then why were the police out there?“</p>
<p>“I have no idea. Did they want to talk to your cousin?“</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. He disappeared when he saw the police car.“</p>
<p>“Were the policemen wearing uniforms?“</p>
<p>“I think so.“</p>
<p>“Were they driving a car that was obviously a police car?“</p>
<p>“I think so.“</p>
<p>“Look, Julio, I gave you my word. I haven’t told the police. And if
they wanted to talk to your cousin about the murder, they wouldn’t be
wearing uniforms and they wouldn’t be driving a car with the word police
painted on the doors. No way. They would be detectives, with coats and
ties and unmarked cars.“</p>
<p>“Are you sure?“</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m sure.“</p>
<p>“Okay.“</p>
<p>“I guess your cousin gets pretty nervous when he sees policemen,
right?“</p>
<p>“Most illegals do.“</p>
<p>“That’s my point. Tell your cousin to relax.“</p>
<p>“Relax? It’s hard to relax when you might get arrested any day of
your life.“</p>
<p>“ Good point.“</p>
<p>Julio was still nervous, his eyes darting around the small room as if
someone else might be listening. There was a long, awkward pause while
each waited for the other to say something. Finally, Julio said,
“There’s something else.“</p>
<p>“What?“</p>
<p>His hands were shaking as he unbuttoned his shirt and pulled out a
clear plastic bag, a Ziploc. He laid it carefully on Theo’s desk as if
it were a gift he never wanted to touch again. In it were two objects,
white in color, slightly worn, and wadded.</p>
<p>Golf gloves.</p>
<p>“My cousin gave me this,“ he said. “Two golf gloves, worn by the man
he saw go into the house where the lady was killed. One for the right
hand, one for the left. The right hand is new. The left hand has been
used.“</p>
<p>Theo gawked at the gloves in the bag, but couldn’t move and for a
moment couldn’t speak. “Where did he find–“</p>
<p>“When the man came out of the house, he took the gloves off and put
them in his golf bag. Later, on the fourteenth tee, he placed these
gloves in the trash bucket next to the water cooler. My cousin’s job is
to empty the trash twice a day. He saw the man and thought it was
strange that he was throwing away good gloves.“</p>
<p>“Did the man see him?“</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. If he had, I don’t think he would have left the
gloves behind.“</p>
<p>“And this is the man who’s on trial now for the murder?“</p>
<p>“Yes, I believe so. My cousin is pretty sure. He saw him on
television.“</p>
<p>“Why did he keep the gloves?“</p>
<p>“The boys out there go through the trash, looking for stuff. My
cousin took the gloves, and within a couple of days he was suspicious. I
guess there’s a lot of gossip around a golf course and there was talk
about the dead woman. So my cousin hid the gloves. Now he’s scared and
he thinks the police are watching him. If they find him with the gloves,
who knows? He’s afraid he might get in trouble.“</p>
<p>“The police are not watching him.“</p>
<p>“I will tell him this.“</p>
<p>A long pause, then Theo nodded at the gloves, still afraid to touch
anything. “And what do we do with these?“</p>
<p>“I’m not keeping them.“</p>
<p>“That’s what I was afraid of.“</p>
<p>“You know what to do, right, Theo?“</p>
<p>“I have no clue. Right now I’m wondering how I got in the middle of
this mess.“</p>
<p>“Can’t you just drop them off at the police station?“</p>
<p>Theo bit his tongue, preventing a phrase or two that would certainly
be taken as sarcastic or cruel or both. How could Julio be expected to
understand the system? Sure, Julio, I’ll just run by the police station,
give the receptionist a Ziploc with two golf gloves, explain that they
were worn by the nice man who’s now on trial for killing his wife, and
who in fact did kill his wife because I, Theo Boone, know the truth
because I, for some reason, have talked to a key witness no one else
knows about it, and, please, Miss Receptionist, take these to a
detective down in Homicide but don’t tell him where they came from.</p>
<p>Poor Julio.</p>
<p>“No, that won’t work, Julio. The police will ask too many questions
and your cousin could be in trouble. The best thing to do is to take
these gloves with you and I’ll pretend I never saw them.“</p>
<p>“No way, Theo. They now belong to you.“ And with that, Julio jumped
to his feet, grabbed the doorknob, and had one foot outside when he
said, over his shoulder, “And you promised not to tell, Theo.“</p>
<p>Theo was behind him. “Sure.“</p>
<p>“You gave me your word.“</p>
<p>“Sure.“</p>
<p>Julio disappeared into the darkness.</p>
