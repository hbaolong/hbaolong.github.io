<h4 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h4>
<p>Ike was at his desk with a tall paper cup of steaming coffee and a
huge cinnamon swirl coated with at least an inch of frosting. It looked
delicious, but Theo had just finished his cereal. Plus, he had no
appetite.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?“ Ike said as Theo sat down, on the very edge of his
chair.</p>
<p>“I guess. I need to talk to someone in confidence, someone I can
trust, someone who knows something about the law.“</p>
<p>“Have you murdered someone? Robbed a bank?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“You seem awfully uptight,“ Ike said as he pulled off a huge bite of
the cinnamon swirl and stuffed it in his mouth.</p>
<p>“It’s the Duffy case, Ike. I might know something about whether
Mr. Duffy is guilty or not.“</p>
<p>Ike kept chewing as he leaned forward on his elbows. The wrinkles
around his eyes squeezed together as he glared at Theo. “Go on.“</p>
<p>“There is a witness out there, a guy nobody knows about, who saw
something at the time of the murder.“</p>
<p>“And you know who it is?“</p>
<p>“Yes, and I promised not to tell.“</p>
<p>“How in the world did you come across this guy?“</p>
<p>“Through a kid at school. I can’t tell you anything else, Ike. I
promised I wouldn’t.“</p>
<p>Ike swallowed hard, then grabbed the cup and took a long sip of the
coffee. His eyes never left Theo. He really wasn’t that surprised. His
nephew knew more lawyers, court clerks, judges, and policemen than
anyone else in town.</p>
<p>“And whatever this unknown witness saw out there would have a big
impact on the trial, is that right?“ Ike asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Has this witness talked to the police or lawyers or anyone involved
with the case?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“And this witness is unwilling to come forward at this time?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“This witness is afraid of something?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Would the testimony of this witness help convict Mr. Duffy, or would
it help acquit him?“</p>
<p>“Convict, no doubt.“</p>
<p>“Have you talked to this witness?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“And you believe him?“</p>
<p>“Yes. He’s telling the truth.“</p>
<p>Another long drink of coffee. A smacking of the lips. Ike’s eyes were
drilling holes in Theo’s.</p>
<p>Ike continued. “Today is Thursday, the third full day of trial. From
what I hear, Judge Gantry is determined to finish this week, even if
that means holding court on Saturday. So the trial is probably half
finished.“</p>
<p>Theo nodded. His uncle stuffed another large bite into his mouth and
chewed slowly. A minute passed.</p>
<p>Ike finally swallowed and said, “So the question is, obviously, what,
if anything, could or should be done about this witness at this point in
the trial?“</p>
<p>“That’s it,“ Theo said.</p>
<p>“Yes, and from what I gather Mr. Jack Hogan needs a few surprises.
The prosecution started with a weak case and it’s only grown
weaker.“</p>
<p>“I thought you weren’t following the trial.“</p>
<p>“I have friends, Theo. Sources.“</p>
<p>Ike jumped to his feet and walked to the far end of the room where
some old shelves were filled with law books. He ran a finger along the
spines of several, then snatched one off a shelf and began thumbing
through the pages. He returned to his desk, sat down, placed the book in
front of him, and searched for whatever was on his mind. Finally, after
a long silence, he said, “Here it is. Under our rules of procedure, a
judge in a criminal trial has the authority to declare a mistrial if the
judge thinks that something improper has occurred. It gives a few
examples: a juror gets contacted by someone with an interest in the
outcome; an important witness gets sick or can’t testify for some
reason; key evidence disappears. Stuff like that.“</p>
<p>Theo knew this. “Does it cover surprise witnesses?“ he asked.</p>
<p>“Not specifically, but it’s a pretty broad rule that allows the judge
to do whatever he thinks is right. The argument could be made that the
absence of an important witness is grounds for a mistrial.“</p>
<p>“What happens after a mistrial?“</p>
<p>“The charges are not dismissed. Another trial is rescheduled.“</p>
<p>“When?“</p>
<p>“It’s up to the judge, but in this case I suspect Gantry wouldn’t
wait too long. A couple of months. Enough time for this secret witness
to get his act together.“</p>
<p>Theo’s mind was racing so fast he couldn’t decide what to say
next.</p>
<p>Ike said, “So, Theo, the question is, How do you convince Judge
Gantry to declare a mistrial before the case goes to the jury? Before
the jury finds Mr. Duffy not guilty, when in fact he is guilty?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know. That’s where you come in, Ike. I need your help.“</p>
<p>Ike shoved the book aside and peeled off another piece of the
cinnamon swirl. He chewed it while he pondered the situation. “Here’s
what we do,“ he said, still chewing. “You go to school. I’ll go over to
the courtroom and have a look. I’ll do some more research, maybe talk to
a friend or two. I won’t use your name. Believe me, Theo, I’ll always
protect you. Can you call me during lunch?“</p>
<p>“Sure.“</p>
<p>“Take off.“</p>
<p>When Theo was at the door, Ike said, “Why haven’t you told your
parents?“</p>
<p>“You think I should?“</p>
<p>“Not yet. Maybe later.“</p>
<p>“They’re very ethical, Ike. You know that. They are officers of the
court and they might force me to reveal what I know. It’s
complicated.“</p>
<p>“Theo, it’s too complicated for a thirteen-year-old.“</p>
<p>“I think I agree.“</p>
<p>“Call me during lunch.“</p>
<p>“Will do, Ike. Thanks.“</p>
<p>During recess, as Theo was hustling away to find April, someone
called his name from down the hall. It was Sandy Coe, racing to catch
up.</p>
<p>“Theo,“ he said. “Got a minute?“</p>
<p>“Uh, sure.“</p>
<p>“Look, I just wanted to tell you that my parents went to see that
bankruptcy lawyer, that Mozingo guy, and he promised them that we are
not going to lose our house.“</p>
<p>“That’s great, Sandy.“</p>
<p>“He said they would have to go through a bankruptcy– all that stuff
you explained to me–but in the end we get to keep the house.“ Sandy
reached into his backpack, pulled out a small envelope, and handed it to
Theo. “This is from my mom. I told her about you, and I think this is a
thank you note.“</p>
<p>Theo reluctantly took it. “She didn’t have to, Sandy. It was
nothing.“</p>
<p>“Nothing? Theo, we get to keep our house.“</p>
<p>And with that, Theo noticed the moisture in Sandy’s eyes. He was
ready to cry. Theo fist-pumped him and said, “My pleasure, Sandy. And if
I can help again, just let me know.“</p>
<p>“Thanks, Theo.“</p>
<p>During Government, Mr. Mount asked Theo to give the class an update
on the Duffy trial. Theo explained that the prosecution was attempting
to prove that Mr. and Mrs. Duffy had been through a rocky marriage and
that they had almost filed for divorce two years earlier. Several of
their friends had been called to testify, but they had been
embarrassed–in Theo’s opinion–by harsh cross-examinations from
Mr. Clifford Nance.</p>
<p>For a second, Theo thought about opening his laptop and reading the
courtroom dialogue hot off the press, but then thought better of it. He
wasn’t committing a crime by hacking into the court reporter’s site, but
there was definitely something wrong with it.</p>
<p>As soon as class was over and the boys headed for the cafeteria, Theo
ducked into a restroom and called Ike. It was almost twelve thirty.
“He’s gonna walk,“ Ike said as he answered the phone. “No way Hogan can
get a conviction.“</p>
<p>“How much did you watch?“ Theo asked, hiding in a stall.</p>
<p>“All morning. Clifford Nance is too good and Hogan has lost his way.
I watched the jurors. They don’t like Pete Duffy, but the proof isn’t
there. He’ll walk.“</p>
<p>“But he’s guilty, Ike.“</p>
<p>“If you say so, Theo. But I don’t know what you know. No one
does.“</p>
<p>“What do we do?“</p>
<p>“I’m still working on it. Stop by after school.“</p>
<p>“You got it.“</p>
