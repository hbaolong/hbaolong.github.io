<h4 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h4>
<p>The Government class crossed Main Street and headed east, toward the
river. Mr. Mount held back a step or two and listened with amusement as
the boys argued back and forth, some of them using phrases and words
they’d just heard from the real lawyers. “This way,“ he said, and the
group hung a left onto a narrow side street. They filed into Pappy’s, a
famous deli known for its pastrami subs and onion rings. It was ten
minutes before noon and they had beaten the rush. They ordered quickly,
then huddled around a long table near the front window. “Who was the
better lawyer?“ Mr. Mount asked.</p>
<p>At least ten answered at once and there was an even split between
Jack Hogan and Clifford Nance. Mr. Mount prodded them with questions
like: “Which lawyer did you believe? Which would you trust? Which did
the jury tend to follow?“ The food arrived and the conversation dropped
dramatically.</p>
<p>“A show of hands,“ Mr. Mount said. “And you must vote. No fence
straddling. Raise your hand if you think Mr. Duffy is guilty.“ He
counted ten hands. “Okay, not guilty.“</p>
<p>He counted five hands. “Theo, I said you must vote.“</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I can’t vote. I think he’s guilty, but I don’t see how
the State can prove its case. All they can prove is motive, maybe.“</p>
<p>“The Maybe Game, huh?“ Mr. Mount said. “I thought that was very
effective.“</p>
<p>“I’m with Theo,“ Aaron said. “He sure looks guilty, but the
prosecutor can’t even place him at the scene of the crime. That’s a
problem, right?“</p>
<p>“A large problem, I’d say,“ Mr. Mount replied.</p>
<p>“What about the stolen jewelry and watches and guns?“ Edward asked.
“Did they find this stuff? It was never mentioned.“</p>
<p>“Don’t know, but then the opening statements are somewhat
limited.“</p>
<p>“They seemed pretty long to me.“</p>
<p>“We’ll find out when the witnesses are called,“ Theo added.</p>
<p>“Who’s the first witness?“ Chase asked.</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen the witness list,“ Mr. Mount said. “But they usually
start with the crime scene. It’ll probably be one of the
detectives.“</p>
<p>“Cool.“</p>
<p>“How late can we stay today, Mr. Mount?“</p>
<p>“We have to be back at school at three thirty.“</p>
<p>“ How late will the trial go?“</p>
<p>“Judge Gantry likes to work,“ Theo said. “At least until five.“</p>
<p>“Can we come back tomorrow, Mr. Mount?“</p>
<p>“Afraid not. It’s a one-day field trip. You do have other classes,
you know. None as exciting as mine, but that’s just my opinion.“ The
deli was suddenly packed and a line formed outside. Mr. Mount told his
students to finish up. Pappy, the owner, was famous for barking at
people who occupied tables long after they had finished eating. They
strolled along Main Street, which was busy now with people scurrying
around on their lunch breaks. At a fountain, office workers ate and
talked while soaking up the sun. Officer Peacock, the ancient traffic
cop, directed traffic with his worn-out whistle and yellow gloves, and
managed to prevent accidents, which was not always the case with Officer
Peacock. Just ahead, a group of men in dark suits left a building and
headed in the same direction as the students. Mr. Mount whispered
loudly, “Look, men, it’s Mr. Duffy and his lawyers.“</p>
<p>The boys slowed for a second as the group of dark suits moved on in
front of them. Pete Duffy, Clifford Nance, two other solemn-faced
lawyers, and a fifth man Theo had not seen in the courtroom that
morning, but one he knew well. His name was Omar Cheepe, and he was not
a lawyer, though he was well known in legal circles. Mr. Cheepe was a
former federal agent of some variety who now ran his own firm. He
specialized in investigations and surveillance and other activities that
lawyers needed from time to time. He and Mrs. Boone had once been
involved in a nasty dispute in a divorce case, and Theo had heard Omar
Cheepe described as “an armed thug,“ and a “man who enjoyed breaking the
law.“ Theo, of course, was not supposed to hear such comments, but then
he heard a lot around the office. He had never actually met Mr. Cheepe,
but he’d seen him in court. The rumor was that if Omar Cheepe was
working on the case, then someone had to be guilty.</p>
<p>Omar looked directly at Theo. He was thick, powerfully built, with a
large round head that he kept shaved. The man tried to look menacing,
and he was successful.</p>
<p>He turned away and hurried after Duffy.</p>
<p>They walked down Main Street, the boys in a loose group, moving fast
to keep up with the defendant and his team. Omar Cheepe’s hulking frame
protected Pete Duffy from the rear, as if someone might take a shot.
Clifford Nance told a funny story, and the men had a good laugh.</p>
<p>Pete Duffy laughed the loudest. Guilty. Theo hated to believe this
because not a single witness had testified. Plus, he liked to tell
himself that he believed in the presumption of innocence.</p>
<p>Guilty, Theo said again, to himself. Why couldn’t he follow the law,
give Mr. Duffy the benefit of innocence? Why couldn’t he do what good
lawyers were supposed to do? This frustrated him as he followed along
behind Mr. Duffy and his lawyers.</p>
<p>There was something missing in the case, and based on what had
already been said in court, Theo suspected that the mystery might never
be solved.</p>
<p>They filed into their seats, front row left side of the balcony, and
allowed their lunch to settle. Judge Gantry had recessed until 1:00
p.m., some fifteen minutes away.</p>
<p>Deputy Gossett, the old bailiff, lumbered over to them and said,
“Theo.“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“Is this your class?“</p>
<p>What else would it be, Deputy Gossett? A teacher, sixteen students?
“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“Judge Gantry would like to see you, in chambers. And hurry. He’s a
busy man.“ Theo pointed to himself, tried to think of something to
say.</p>
<p>“The whole class,“ Deputy Gossett said. “And hurry.“</p>
<p>They scrambled into formation behind Deputy Gossett and hustled down
the stairs. “In chambers“ meant the judge was in his office behind the
bench, adjacent to the courtroom. This office was different from his
formal office down the hall. It was confusing and Theo was attempting to
explain this when Deputy Gossett opened the door to a long, wood-paneled
room with old portraits of old bearded judges covering the walls. Judge
Gantry, without his black robe, rose from behind his desk and stepped
out to meet the boys. “Hello, Theo,“ he said, embarrassing Theo
slightly. The other students were too awestruck to speak. “And you must
be Mr. Mount,“ the judge was saying as they shook hands.</p>
<p>“Yes, Judge, and this is my eighth-grade Government class.“</p>
<p>Since there were not enough seats for everyone, Judge Gantry
addressed the boys where they stood. “Thank you for coming. It’s
important for students to see our judicial system in action. What do you
think so far?“ All sixteen boys were mute. What were they supposed to
say?</p>
<p>Mr. Mount rescued them. “They are fascinated by the trial,“ he said.
“We just debriefed over lunch, rated the lawyers, talked about the
jurors, and had a lot of opinions about guilt and innocence.“</p>
<p>“I won’t ask. But we have a couple of pretty good lawyers, don’t you
think?“</p>
<p>All sixteen heads nodded.</p>
<p>“Is it true that Theo Boone actually gives legal advice?“</p>
<p>A few nervous laughs. Theo was both embarrassed and proud. “Yes, but
I don’t charge them anything,“ he said. A few more laughs. “Any
questions about the trial?“ Judge Gantry asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,“ Brandon said. “On television you always see a surprise
witness that comes out of nowhere and changes the trial. Is there a
chance of a surprise witness here? If not, it seems like the State has a
pretty weak case.“</p>
<p>“Good question, son. The answer is no. Our rules of procedure
prohibit surprise witnesses. Television gets it all wrong. In real life,
before the trial starts, each side must provide a list of all potential
witnesses.“</p>
<p>“Who’s the first witness?“ Jarvis asked.</p>
<p>“The victim’s sister, the lady who found the body. She’ll be followed
by the homicide detectives. How long can you stay today?“</p>
<p>“ We need to be back at school at three thirty,“ Mr. Mount said.</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ll call a recess at three, and you can ease out. How are the
seats up in the balcony?“</p>
<p>“Great, and thank you.“</p>
<p>“I’ve moved you down to the floor. Things have cleared out a bit.
Again, thanks for taking such an interest in our judicial system. It’s
very important to good government.“ With that, Judge Gantry was
finished. The students thanked him. He and Mr. Mount shook hands again.
Deputy Gossett led them out of chambers, back to the courtroom, down the
main aisle, and to the second row behind the prosecution’s table. In
front of them were the two young men who’d been introduced as
Mrs. Duffy’s sons. The lawyers were only a few feet away. Across the
aisle, Omar was now sitting behind Pete Duffy, his black eyes darting
around the courtroom as if he might need to shoot someone. Once again,
he looked directly at Theo.</p>
<p>They had gone from the cheap seats to ringside, and they couldn’t
believe it. Chase, the mad scientist, was to Theo’s right, elbow to
elbow. He whispered, “Did you pull some strings, Theo?“</p>
<p>“No, but Judge Gantry and I are pretty tight.“</p>
<p>“Nice work.“</p>
<p>At precisely 1:00 p.m., the bench bailiff stood and wailed, “Court is
now in session. Please remain seated.“</p>
<p>Judge Gantry appeared in his robe and took his seat. He looked at
Jack Hogan and said, “The State may call its first witness.“ From a side
door, another bailiff escorted a well-dressed lady into the courtroom
and to the witness chair. She placed her hand on a Bible and swore to
tell the truth. When she was seated and the microphone adjusted,
Mr. Hogan began his direct examination. Her name was Emily Green, the
sister of Myra Duffy. She was forty-four, lived in Strattenburg, worked
as a fitness counselor, and on the day of the murder she had done
exactly what Mr. Hogan described in his opening statement. When her
sister didn’t show for lunch, and didn’t call, she became worried, then
panicky. She called her repeatedly on her cell phone, then raced to
Waverly Creek, to the Duffy home, and found her sister dead on the
living room carpet. It was obvious, at least to Theo, that Mr. Hogan and
Ms. Green had carefully rehearsed her testimony. It was designed to
establish death, and to evoke sympathy. When they finished, Clifford
Nance stood and announced that he had no questions on cross-examination.
Ms. Green was excused, and she took a seat in the front row, next to her
two nephews, directly in front of Mr. Mount’s students.</p>
<p>The next witness was Detective Krone, from Homicide. Using the large
screen and the projector, he and Jack Hogan laid out the neighborhood,
the Duffy home, and the crime scene. Several important facts were
established, though the jury already knew them. The front door was found
open. The rear door and the side patio door were not locked. The alarm
system was not engaged.</p>
<p>And new facts emerged. Fingerprint tests found matches throughout the
house for Mr. Duffy, Mrs. Duffy, and their housekeeper, but this was to
be expected. No other matches were found on doorknobs, windows, phones,
drawers, the jewelry case, or the antique mahogany box where Mr. Duffy
kept his expensive watches. This meant one of two things: (1) the
murderer wore gloves or carefully wiped away any prints, or (2) the
murderer was either Mr. Duffy or the housekeeper. The housekeeper was
not at work on the day of the murder–she was out of town with her
husband.</p>
<p>Whoever took the jewelry, guns, and watches had also yanked open
several other cabinets and drawers and flung items on the floor.
Detective Krone, who was pretty dull to listen to, methodically went
through photo after photo of the mess left behind by the murderer.</p>
<p>For the first time, the trial began to drag. Mr. Mount noticed a few
of the boys starting to fidget. A couple of the jurors looked
sleepy.</p>
<p>At precisely 3:00 p.m., Judge Gantry banged his gavel and announced a
fifteen-minute recess. The courtroom emptied quickly. Everyone needed a
break. Theo and his friends left the courthouse, boarded a small yellow
bus, and ten minutes later were back at school in time for
dismissal.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes after he left, Theo was back in the courthouse. He
sprinted up the stairs to the third floor. There was no sign of the
Finnemore war–no lawyers in the hallway, no sign of April. She had not
called or answered his e-mails the night before, nor had she posted
anything on her Facebook page. Her parents would not allow her to have a
cell phone, so she could not text. This was not that unusual. About half
of the eighth graders at the middle school did not have cell phones.</p>
<p>Theo hurried down to the second floor, entered the courtroom under
the suspicious gaze of Deputy Gossett, and found a seat on the third
row, behind the defense table. The defendant, Mr. Duffy, sat less than
twenty feet away. Theo could hear his lawyers as they whispered
important things. Omar Cheepe was still there. He noticed Theo when he
sat down. As an experienced observer, Omar had the ability to see all
movements, but he did it casually, as if he really didn’t care.</p>
<p>The witness was a doctor, the medical examiner who performed the
autopsy on the victim. He was using a large color diagram of a human
body from the chest up, with emphasis on the neck area. Theo paid more
attention to Clifford Nance than to the witness. He watched Mr. Nance as
he listened intently to the testimony, and took notes, and continually
glanced at the jury. He seemed to miss nothing in the courtroom. He was
relaxed and confident, though ready to attack if necessary.</p>
<p>His cross-examination of the doctor was quick and revealed nothing
new. So far, Mr. Nance seemed content to agree with most of the
prosecution’s witnesses. The fireworks would come later.</p>
<p>Judge Gantry adjourned court just after 5:00 p.m. Before he excused
the jurors, he again warned them against discussing the case with
anyone. After they filed out, the courtroom emptied. Theo hung around,
watching the lawyers gather their files and books as they repacked their
thick briefcases and talked in hushed tones. There were words across the
aisle. Jack Hogan said something to Clifford Nance and both men laughed.
The other, lesser I lawyers joined in, and someone said, “How about a
drink?“</p>
<p>Enemies one moment, old pals the next. Theo had seen it before. His
mother had tried to explain that lawyers are paid to do a job, and to do
it properly they had to park their personal feelings at the door. The
real professionals, she said, never lose their cool and carry
grudges.</p>
<p>Ike said that was nonsense. He despised most of the lawyers in
town.</p>
<p>Omar Cheepe was not laughing, and he was not invited to have a drink
with the enemy. He and Pete Duffy made a quick exit through a side
door.</p>
