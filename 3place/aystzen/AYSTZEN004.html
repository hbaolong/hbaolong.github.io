<h4 id="chapter-one-the-light-beam-rider">CHAPTER ONE THE LIGHT-BEAM
RIDER</h4>
<p>“I promise you four papers,” the young patent examiner wrote his
friend. The letter would turn out to bear some of the most significant
tidings in the history of science, but its momentous nature was masked
by an impish tone that was typical of its author. He had, after all,
just addressed his friend as “you frozen whale”and apologized for
writing a letter that was “inconsequential babble.” Only when he got
around to describing the papers, which he had produced during his spare
time, did he give some indication that he sensed their
significance.1</p>
<p>“The first deals with radiation and the energy properties of light
and is very revolutionary,” he explained. Yes, it was indeed
revolutionary. It argued that light could be regarded not just as a wave
but also as a stream of tiny particles called quanta. The implications
that would eventually arise from this theory—a cosmos without strict
causality or certainty—would spook him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>“The second paper is a determination of the true sizes of atoms.”
Even though the very existence of atoms was still in dispute, this was
the most straightforward of the papers, which is why he chose it as the
safest bet for his latest attempt at a doctoral thesis. He was in the
process of revolutionizing physics, but he had been repeatedly thwarted
in his efforts to win an academic job or even get a doctoral degree,
which he hoped might get him promoted from a third- to a second-class
examiner at the patent office.</p>
<p>The third paper explained the jittery motion of microscopic particles
in liquid by using a statistical analysis of random collisions. In the
process, it established that atoms and molecules actually exist.</p>
<p>“The fourth paper is only a rough draft at this point, and is an
electrodynamics of moving bodies which employs a modification of the
theory of space and time.” Well, that was certainly more than
inconsequential babble. Based purely on thought experiments—performed in
his head rather than in a lab—he had decided to discard Newton’s
concepts of absolute space and time. It would become known as the
Special Theory of Relativity.</p>
<p>What he did not tell his friend, because it had not yet occurred to
him, was that he would produce a fifth paper that year, a short addendum
to the fourth, which posited a relationship between energy and mass. Out
of it would arise the best-known equation in all of physics: E=mc2.</p>
<p>Looking back at a century that will be remembered for its willingness
to break classical bonds, and looking ahead to an era that seeks to
nurture the creativity needed for scientific innovation, one person
stands out as a paramount icon of our age: the kindly refugee from
oppression whose wild halo of hair, twinkling eyes, engaging humanity,
and extraordinary brilliance made his face a symbol and his name a
synonym for genius. Albert Einstein was a locksmith blessed with
imagination and guided by a faith in the harmony of nature’s handiwork.
His fascinating story, a testament to the connection between creativity
and freedom, reflects the triumphs and tumults of the modern era.</p>
<p>Now that his archives have been completely opened, it is possible to
explore how the private side of Einstein—his nonconformist personality,
his instincts as a rebel, his curiosity, his passions and
detachments—intertwined with his political side and his scientific side.
Knowing about the man helps us understand the wellsprings of his
science, and vice versa. Character and imagination and creative genius
were all related, as if part of some unified field.</p>
<p>Despite his reputation for being aloof, he was in fact passionate in
both his personal and scientific pursuits. At college he fell madly in
love with the only woman in his physics class, a dark and intense
Serbian named Mileva Mari. They had an illegitimate daughter, then
married and had two sons. She served as a sounding board for his
scientific ideas and helped to check the math in his papers, but
eventually their relationship disintegrated. Einstein offered her a
deal. He would win the Nobel Prize someday, he said; if she gave him a
divorce, he would give her the prize money. She thought for a week and
accepted. Because his theories were so radical, it was seventeen years
after his miraculous outpouring from the patent office before he was
awarded the prize and she collected.</p>
<p>Einstein’s life and work reflected the disruption of societal
certainties and moral absolutes in the modernist atmosphere of the early
twentieth century. Imaginative nonconformity was in the air: Picasso,
Joyce, Freud, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, and others were breaking
conventional bonds. Charging this atmosphere was a conception of the
universe in which space and time and the properties of particles seemed
based on the vagaries of observations.</p>
<p>Einstein, however, was not truly a relativist, even though that is
how he was interpreted by many, including some whose disdain was tinged
by anti-Semitism. Beneath all of his theories, including relativity, was
a quest for invariants, certainties, and absolutes. There was a
harmonious reality underlying the laws of the universe, Einstein felt,
and the goal of science was to discover it.</p>
<p>His quest began in 1895, when as a 16-year-old he imagined what it
would be like to ride alongside a light beam. A decade later came his
miracle year, described in the letter above, which laid the foundations
for the two great advances of twentieth-century physics: relativity and
quantum theory.</p>
<p>A decade after that, in 1915, he wrested from nature his crowning
glory, one of the most beautiful theories in all of science, the general
theory of relativity. As with the special theory, his thinking had
evolved through thought experiments. Imagine being in an enclosed
elevator accelerating up through space, he conjectured in one of them.
The effects you’d feel would be indistinguishable from the experience of
gravity.</p>
<p>Gravity, he figured, was a warping of space and time, and he came up
with the equations that describe how the dynamics of this curvature
result from the interplay between matter, motion, and energy. It can be
described by using another thought experiment. Picture what it would be
like to roll a bowling ball onto the two-dimensional surface of a
trampoline. Then roll some billiard balls. They move toward the bowling
ball not because it exerts some mysterious attraction but because of the
way it curves the trampoline fabric. Now imagine this happening in the
four-dimensional fabric of space and time. Okay, it’s not easy, but
that’s why we’re no Einstein and he was.</p>
<p>The exact midpoint of his career came a decade after that, in 1925,
and it was a turning point. The quantum revolution he had helped to
launch was being transformed into a new mechanics that was based on
uncertainties and probabilities. He made his last great contributions to
quantum mechanics that year but, simultaneously, began to resist it. He
would spend the next three decades, ending with some equations scribbled
while on his deathbed in 1955, stubbornly criticizing what he regarded
as the incompleteness of quantum mechanics while attempting to subsume
it into a unified field theory.</p>
<p>Both during his thirty years as a revolutionary and his subsequent
thirty years as a resister, Einstein remained consistent in his
willingness to be a serenely amused loner who was comfortable not
conforming. Independent in his thinking, he was driven by an imagination
that broke from the confines of conventional wisdom. He was that odd
breed, a reverential rebel, and he was guided by a faith, which he wore
lightly and with a twinkle in his eye, in a God who would not play dice
by allowing things to happen by chance.</p>
<p>Einstein’s nonconformist streak was evident in his personality and
politics as well. Although he subscribed to socialist ideals, he was too
much of an individualist to be comfortable with excessive state control
or centralized authority. His impudent instincts, which served him so
well as a young scientist, made him allergic to nationalism, militarism,
and anything that smacked of a herd mentality. And until Hitler caused
him to revise his geopolitical equations, he was an instinctive pacifist
who celebrated resistance to war.</p>
<p>His tale encompasses the vast sweep of modern science, from the
infinitesimal to the infinite, from the emission of photons to the
expansion of the cosmos. A century after his great triumphs, we are
still living in Einstein’s universe, one defined on the macro scale by
his theory of relativity and on the micro scale by a quantum mechanics
that has proven durable even as it remains disconcerting.</p>
<p>His fingerprints are all over today’s technologies. Photoelectric
cells and lasers, nuclear power and fiber optics, space travel, and even
semiconductors all trace back to his theories. He signed the letter to
Franklin Roosevelt warning that it may be possible to build an atom
bomb, and the letters of his famed equation relating energy to mass
hover in our minds when we picture the resulting mushroom cloud.</p>
<p>Einstein’s launch into fame, which occurred when measurements made
during a 1919 eclipse confirmed his prediction of how much gravity bends
light, coincided with, and contributed to, the birth of a new celebrity
age. He became a scientific supernova and humanist icon, one of the most
famous faces on the planet. The public earnestly puzzled over his
theories, elevated him into a cult of genius, and canonized him as a
secular saint.</p>
<p>If he did not have that electrified halo of hair and those piercing
eyes, would he still have become science’s preeminent poster boy?
Suppose, as a thought experiment, that he had looked like a Max Planck
or a Niels Bohr. Would he have remained in their reputational orbit,
that of a mere scientific genius? Or would he still have made the leap
into the pantheon inhabited by Aristotle, Galileo, and Newton?2</p>
<p>The latter, I believe, is the case. His work had a very personal
character, a stamp that made it recognizably his, the way a Picasso is
recognizably a Picasso. He made imaginative leaps and discerned great
principles through thought experiments rather than by methodical
inductions based on experimental data. The theories that resulted were
at times astonishing, mysterious, and counterintuitive, yet they
contained notions that could capture the popular imagination: the
relativity of space and time, E=mc 2, the bending of light beams, and
the warping of space.</p>
<p>Adding to his aura was his simple humanity. His inner security was
tempered by the humility that comes from being awed by nature. He could
be detached and aloof from those close to him, but toward mankind in
general he exuded a true kindness and gentle compassion.</p>
<p>Yet for all of his popular appeal and surface accessibility, Einstein
also came to symbolize the perception that modern physics was something
that ordinary laymen could not comprehend, “the province of priest-like
experts,” in the words of Harvard professor Dudley Herschbach.3 It was
not always thus. Galileo and Newton were both great geniuses, but their
mechanical cause-and-effect explanation of the world was something that
most thoughtful folks could grasp. In the eighteenth century of Benjamin
Franklin and the nineteenth century of Thomas Edison, an educated person
could feel some familiarity with science and even dabble in it as an
amateur.</p>
<p>A popular feel for scientific endeavors should, if possible, be
restored given the needs of the twenty-first century. This does not mean
that every literature major should take a watered-down physics course or
that a corporate lawyer should stay abreast of quantum mechanics.
Rather, it means that an appreciation for the methods of science is a
useful asset for a responsible citizenry. What science teaches us, very
significantly, is the correlation between factual evidence and general
theories, something well illustrated in Einstein’s life.</p>
<p>In addition, an appreciation for the glories of science is a joyful
trait for a good society. It helps us remain in touch with that
childlike capacity for wonder, about such ordinary things as falling
apples and elevators, that characterizes Einstein and other great
theoretical physicists.4</p>
<p>That is why studying Einstein can be worthwhile. Science is inspiring
and noble, and its pursuit an enchanting mission, as the sagas of its
heroes remind us. Near the end of his life, Einstein was asked by the
New York State Education Department what schools should emphasize. “In
teaching history,” he replied, “there should be extensive discussion of
personalities who benefited mankind through independence of character
and judgment.”5 Einstein fits into that category.</p>
<p>At a time when there is a new emphasis, in the face of global
competition, on science and math education, we should also note the
other part of Einstein’s answer. “Critical comments by students should
be taken in a friendly spirit,” he said. “Accumulation of material
should not stifle the student’s independence.” A society’s competitive
advantage will come not from how well its schools teach the
multiplication and periodic tables, but from how well they stimulate
imagination and creativity.</p>
<p>Therein lies the key, I think, to Einstein’s brilliance and the
lessons of his life. As a young student he never did well with rote
learning. And later, as a theorist, his success came not from the brute
strength of his mental processing power but from his imagination and
creativity. He could construct complex equations, but more important, he
knew that math is the language nature uses to describe her wonders. So
he could visualize how equations were reflected in realities—how the
electromagnetic field equations discovered by James Clerk Maxwell, for
example, would manifest themselves to a boy riding alongside a light
beam. As he once declared, “Imagination is more important than
knowledge.”6</p>
<p>That approach required him to embrace nonconformity. “Long live
impudence!” he exulted to the lover who would later become his wife. “It
is my guardian angel in this world.” Many years later, when others
thought that his reluctance to embrace quantum mechanics showed that he
had lost his edge, he lamented, “To punish me for my contempt for
authority, fate made me an authority myself.”7</p>
<p>His success came from questioning conventional wisdom, challenging
authority, and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane.
This led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for
free minds, free spirits, and free individuals. Tyranny repulsed him,
and he saw tolerance not simply as a sweet virtue but as a necessary
condition for a creative society. “It is important to foster
individuality,” he said, “for only the individual can produce the new
ideas.”8</p>
<p>This outlook made Einstein a rebel with a reverence for the harmony
of nature, one who had just the right blend of imagination and wisdom to
transform our understanding of the universe. These traits are just as
vital for this new century of globalization, in which our success will
depend on our creativity, as they were for the beginning of the
twentieth century, when Einstein helped usher in the modern age.</p>
