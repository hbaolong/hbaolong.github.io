LAUREATE</h4>
<p>1921–1927</p>
<p>Einstein in Paris, 1922</p>
<p>The 1921 Prize</p>
<p>It seemed obvious that Einstein would someday win the Nobel Prize for
Physics. He had, in fact, already agreed to transfer the money to his
first wife, Mileva Mari, when that occurred. The questions were: When
would it happen? and, For what?</p>
<p>Once it was announced—in November 1922, awarding him the prize for
1921—the questions were: What took so long? and, Why “especially for his
discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect”?</p>
<p>It has been part of the popular lore that Einstein learned that he
had finally won while on his way to Japan. “Nobel Prize for physics
awarded to you. More by letter,” read the telegram sent on November 10.
In fact, he had been alerted as soon as the Swedish Academy made the
decision in September, well before he left on his trip.</p>
<p>The chairman of the physics award committee, Svante Arrhenius, had
heard that Einstein was planning to go to Japan in October, which meant
that he would be away for the ceremony unless he postponed the trip. So
he wrote Einstein directly and explicitly: “It will probably be very
desirable for you to come to Stockholm in December.” Expressing a
principle of pre–jet travel physics, he added, “And if you are then in
Japan that will be impossible.”1 Coming from the head of a Nobel Prize
committee, it was clear what that meant. There are not a lot of other
reasons for physicists to be summoned to Stockholm in December.</p>
<p>Despite knowing that he would finally win, Einstein did not see fit
to postpone his trip. Partly it was because he had been passed over so
often that it had begun to annoy him.</p>
<p>He had first been nominated for the prize in 1910 by the chemistry
laureate Wilhelm Ostwald, who had rejected Einstein’s pleas for a job
nine years earlier. Ostwald cited special relativity, emphasizing that
the theory involved fundamental physics and not, as some Einstein
detractors argued, mere philosophy. It was a point that he reiterated
over the next few years as he resubmitted the nomination.</p>
<p>The Swedish committee was mindful of the charge in Alfred Nobel’s
will that the prize should go to “the most important discovery or
invention,” and it felt that relativity theory was not exactly either of
those. So it reported that it needed to wait for more experimental
evidence “before one can accept the principle and in particular award it
a Nobel prize.”2</p>
<p>Einstein continued to be nominated for his work on relativity during
most of the ensuing ten years, gaining support from distinguished
theorists such as Wilhelm Wien, although not yet from a still-skeptical
Lorentz. His greatest obstacle was that the committee at the time was
leery of pure theorists. Three out of the committee’s five members
throughout the period from 1910 to 1922 were experimentalists from
Sweden’s Uppsala University, known for its fervent devotion to
perfecting experimental and measuring techniques. “Swedish physicists
with a strong experimentalist bias dominated the committee,” notes
Robert Marc Friedman, a historian of science in Oslo. “They held
precision measurement as the highest goal for their discipline.” That is
one reason Max Planck had to wait until 1919 (when he was awarded the
delayed prize for 1918) and why Henri Poincaré never won at all.3</p>
<p>The dramatic announcement in November 1919 that the eclipse
observations had confirmed parts of Einstein’s theory should have made
1920 his year. By then Lorentz was no longer such a skeptic. He along
with Bohr and six other official nominators wrote in support of
Einstein, mostly focusing on his completed theory of relativity. (Planck
wrote in support as well, but his letter arrived after the deadline for
consideration.) As Lorentz’s letter declared, Einstein “has placed
himself in the first rank of physicists of all time.” Bohr’s letter was
equally clear: “One faces here an advance of decisive
significance.”4</p>
<p>Politics intervened. Up until then, the primary justifications for
denying Einstein a Nobel had been scientific: his work was purely
theoretical, it lacked experimental grounding, and it putatively did not
involve the “discovery” of any new laws. After the eclipse observations,
the explanation of the shift in Mercury’s orbit, and other experimental
confirmations, these arguments against Einstein were still made, but
they were now tinged with more cultural and personal bias. To his
critics, the fact that he had suddenly achieved superstar status as the
most internationally celebrated scientist since the lightning-tamer
Benjamin Franklin was paraded through the streets of Paris was evidence
of his self-promotion rather than his worthiness of a Nobel.</p>
<p>This subtext was evident in the internal seven-page report prepared
by Arrhenius, the committee chairman, explaining why Einstein should not
win the prize in 1920. He noted that the eclipse results had been
criticized as ambiguous and that scientists had not yet confirmed the
theory’s prediction that light coming from the sun would be shifted
toward the red end of the spectrum by the sun’s gravity. He also cited
the discredited argument of Ernst Gehrcke, one of the anti-Semitic
antirelativists who led the notorious 1920 rally against Einstein that
summer in Berlin, that the shift in Mercury’s orbit could be explained
by other theories.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, Einstein’s other leading anti-Semitic critic,
Philipp Lenard, was waging a crusade against him. (The following year,
Lenard would propose Gehrcke for the prize!) Sven Hedin, a Swedish
explorer who was a prominent member of the Academy, later recalled that
Lenard worked hard to persuade him and others that “relativity was
really not a discovery” and that it had not been proven.5</p>
<p>Arrhenius’s report cited Lenard’s “strong critique of the oddities in
Einstein’s generalized theory of relativity.” Lenard’s views were
couched as a criticism of physics that was not grounded in experiments
and concrete discoveries. But there was a strong undercurrent in the
report of Lenard’s animosity to the type of “philosophical conjecturing”
that he often dismissed as being a feature of “Jewish science.”6</p>
<p>So the 1920 prize instead went to another Zurich Polytechnic graduate
who was Einstein’s scientific opposite: Charles-Edouard Guillaume, the
director of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, who had
made his modest mark on science by assuring that standard measures were
more precise and discovering metal alloys that had practical uses,
including making good measuring rods. “When the world of physics had
entered upon an intellectual adventure of extraordinary proportions, it
was remarkable to find Guillaume’s accomplishment, based on routine
study and modest theoretical finesse, recognized as a beacon of
achievement,” says Friedman. “Even those who opposed relativity theory
found Guillaume a bizarre choice.”7</p>
<p>By 1921, the public’s Einstein mania was in full force, for better or
worse, and there was a groundswell of support for him from both
theoreticians and experimentalists, Germans such as Planck and
non-Germans such as Eddington. He garnered fourteen official
nominations, far more than any other contender. “Einstein stands above
his contemporaries even as Newton did,” wrote Eddington, offering the
highest praise a member of the Royal Society could muster.8</p>
<p>This time the prize committee assigned the task of doing a report on
relativity to Allvar Gullstrand, a professor of ophthalmology at the
University of Uppsala, who had won the prize for medicine in 1911. With
little expertise in either the math or the physics of relativity, he
criticized Einstein’s theory in a sharp but unknowing manner. Clearly
determined to undermine Einstein by any means, Gullstrand’s fifty-page
report declared, for example, that the bending of light was not a true
test of Einstein’s theory, that the results were not experimentally
valid, and that even if they were there were still other ways to explain
the phenomenon using classical mechanics. As for Mercury’s orbit, he
declared, “It remains unknown until further notice whether the Einstein
theory can at all be brought into agreement with the perihelion
experiment.” And the effects of special relativity, he said, “lay below
the limits of experimental error.” As one who had made his name by
devising precision optical measuring instruments, Gullstrand seemed
particularly appalled by Einstein’s theory that the length of rigid
measuring rods could vary relative to moving observers.9</p>
<p>Even though some members of the full Academy realized that
Gullstrand’s opposition was unsophisticated, it was hard to overcome. He
was a respected and popular Swedish professor, and he insisted both
publicly and privately that the great honor of a Nobel should not be
given to a highly speculative theory that was the subject of an
inexplicable mass hysteria that would soon deflate. Instead of choosing
someone else, the Academy did something that was less (or more?) of a
public slap at Einstein: it voted to choose nobody and tentatively bank
the 1921 award for another year.</p>
<p>The great impasse threatened to become embarrassing. His lack of a
prize had begun to reflect more negatively on the Nobel than on
Einstein. “Imagine for a moment what the general opinion will be fifty
years from now if the name Einstein does not appear on the list of Nobel
laureates,” wrote the French physicist Marcel Brillouin in his 1922
nominating letter.10</p>
<p>To the rescue rode a theoretical physicist from the University of
Uppsala, Carl Wilhelm Oseen, who joined the committee in 1922. He was a
colleague and friend of Gullstrand, which helped him gently overcome
some of the ophthalmologist’s ill-conceived but stubborn objections. And
he realized that the whole issue of relativity theory was so encrusted
with controversy that it would be better to try a different tack. So
Oseen pushed hard to give the prize to Einstein for “the discovery of
the law of the photoelectric effect.”</p>
<p>Each part of that phrase was carefully calculated. It was not a
nomination for relativity, of course. In fact, despite the way it has
been phrased by some historians, it was not for Einstein’s theory of
light quanta, even though that was the primary focus of the relevant
1905 paper. Nor was it for any theory at all. Instead, it was for the
discovery of a law.</p>
<p>A report from the previous year had discussed Einstein’s “theory of
the photoelectric effect,” but Oseen made clear his different approach
with the title of his report: “Einstein’s Law of the Photoelectric
Effect” (emphasis added). In it, Oseen did not focus on the theoretical
aspects of Einstein’s work. He specified instead what he called a
fundamental natural law, fully proven by experiment, that Einstein
propounded: the mathematical description of how the photoelectric effect
was explained by assuming that light was absorbed and emitted in
discrete quanta, and the way this related to the frequency of the
light.</p>
<p>Oseen also proposed that giving Einstein the prize delayed from 1921
would allow the Academy to use that as a basis for simultaneously giving
Niels Bohr the 1922 prize, because his model of the atom built on the
laws that explained the photoelectric effect. It was a clever
coupled-entry ticket for making sure that the two greatest theoretical
physicists of the time became Nobel laureates without offending the
Academy’s old-line establishment. Gullstrand went along. Arrhenius, who
had met Einstein in Berlin and been charmed, was now also willing to
accept the inevitable. On September 6, 1922, the Academy voted
accordingly, and Einstein and Bohr were awarded the 1921 and 1922
prizes, respectively.</p>
<p>Thus it was that Einstein became the recipient of the 1921 Nobel
Prize, in the words of the official citation, “for his services to
theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the
photoelectric effect.” In both the citation and the letter from the
Academy’s secretary officially informing Einstein, an unusual caveat was
explicitly inserted. Both documents specified that the award was given
“without taking into account the value that will be accorded your
relativity and gravitation theories after these are confirmed in the
future.”11 Einstein would not, as it turned out, ever win a Nobel for
his work on relativity and gravitation, nor for anything other than the
photoelectric effect.</p>
<p>There was a dark irony in using the photoelectric effect as a path to
get Einstein the prize. His “law” was based primarily on observations
made by Philipp Lenard, who had been the most fervent campaigner to have
him blackballed. In his 1905 paper, Einstein had credited Lenard’s
“pioneering” work. But after the 1920 anti-Semitic rally in Berlin, they
had become bitter enemies. So Lenard was doubly outraged that, despite
his opposition, Einstein had won the prize and, worse yet, done so in a
field that Lenard pioneered. He wrote an angry letter to the Academy,
the only official protest it received, in which he said that Einstein
misunderstood the true nature of light and was, in addition, a
publicity-seeking Jew whose approach was alien to the true spirit of
German physics.12</p>
<p>Einstein was traveling by train through Japan and missed the official
award ceremony on December 10. After much controversy over whether he
should be considered German or Swiss, the prize was accepted by the
German ambassador, but he was listed as both nationalities in the
official record.</p>
<p>The formal presentation speech by Arrhenius, the committee chair, was
carefully crafted. “There is probably no physicist living today whose
name has become so widely known as that of Albert Einstein,” he began.
“Most discussion centers on his theory of relativity.” He then went on
to say, almost dismissively, that “this pertains essentially to
epistemology and has therefore been the subject of lively debate in
philosophical circles.”</p>
<p>After touching briefly on Einstein’s other work, Arrhenius explained
the Academy’s position on why he had won. “Einstein’s law of the
photoelectrical effect has been extremely rigorously tested by the
American Millikan* and his pupils and passed the test brilliantly,” he
said. “Einstein’s law has become the basis of quantitative
photo-chemistry in the same way as Faraday’s law is the basis of
electro-chemistry.”13</p>
<p>Einstein gave his official acceptance speech the following July at a
Swedish science conference with King Gustav Adolf V in attendance. He
spoke not about the photoelectric effect, but about relativity, and he
concluded by emphasizing the importance of his new passion, finding a
unified field theory that would reconcile general relativity with
electromagnetic theory and, if possible, with quantum mechanics.14</p>
<p>The prize money that year amounted to 121,572 Swedish kronor, or
2,250, which was more than ten times the annual salary of the average
professor at the time. As per his divorce agreement with Mari, Einstein
had part of it sent directly to Zurich to reside in a trust for her and
their sons, and the rest went into an American account with the interest
directed for her use.</p>
<p>This prompted another row. Hans Albert complained that the trust
arrangement, which had previously been agreed to, made only the interest
on the money accessible to the family. Once again, Zangger intervened
and calmed the dispute. Einstein jokingly wrote to his sons, “You all
will be so rich that some fine day I may ask you for a loan.”The money
was eventually used by Mari to buy three homes with rental apartments in
Zurich.15</p>
<p>Newton’s Bucket and the Ether Reincarnated</p>
<p>“Anything truly novel is invented only during one’s youth,” Einstein
lamented to a friend after finishing his work on general relativity and
cosmology. “Later one becomes more experienced, more famous—and more
blockheaded.”16</p>
<p>Einstein turned 40 in 1919, the year that the eclipse observations
made him world-famous. For the next six years, he continued to make
important contributions to quantum theory. But after that, as we shall
see, he would begin to seem, if not blockheaded, at least a bit stubborn
as he resisted quantum mechanics and embarked on a long, lonely, and
unsuccessful effort to devise a unified theory that would subsume it
into a more deterministic framework.</p>
<p>Over the ensuing years, researchers would discover new forces in
nature, besides electromagnetism and gravity, and also new particles.
These would make Einstein’s attempts at unification all the more
complex. But he would find himself less familiar with the latest data in
experimental physics, and he thus would no longer have the same
intuitive feel for how to wrest from nature her fundamental
principles.</p>
<p>If Einstein had retired after the eclipse observations and devoted
himself to sailing for the remaining thirty-six years of his life, would
science have suffered? Yes, for even though most of his attacks on
quantum mechanics did not prove to be warranted, he did serve to
strengthen the theory by coming up with a few advances and also, less
intentionally, by his ingenious but futile efforts to poke holes in
it.</p>
<p>That raises another question: Why was Einstein so much more creative
before the age of 40 than after? Partly, it is an occupational hazard of
mathematicians and theoretical physicists to have their great
breakthroughs before turning 40.17 “The intellect gets crippled,”
Einstein explained to a friend, “but glittering renown is still draped
around the calcified shell.”18</p>
<p>More specifically, Einstein’s scientific successes had come in part
from his rebelliousness. There was a link between his creativity and his
willingness to defy authority. He had no sentimental attachment to the
old order, thus was energized by upending it. His stubbornness had
worked to his advantage.</p>
<p>But now, just as he had traded his youthful bohemian attitudes for
the comforts of a bourgeois home, he had become wedded to the faith that
field theories could preserve the certainties and determinism of
classical science. His stubbornness henceforth would work to his
disadvantage.</p>
<p>It was a fate that he had begun fearing years before, not long after
he finished his famous flurry of 1905 papers. “Soon I will reach the age
of stagnation and sterility when one laments the revolutionary spirit of
the young,” he had worried to his colleague from the Olympia Academy,
Maurice Solovine.19</p>
<p>Now, many triumphs later, there were young revolutionaries who felt
this fate had indeed befallen him. In one of his most revealing remarks
about himself, Einstein lamented, “To punish me for my contempt of
authority, Fate has made me an authority myself.”20</p>
<p>Thus it is not surprising that, during the 1920s, Einstein found
himself scaling back on some of his bolder earlier ideas. For example,
in his 1905 special relativity paper he had famously dismissed the
concept of the ether as “superfluous.” But after he finished his theory
of general relativity, he concluded that the gravitational potentials in
that theory characterized the physical qualities of empty space and
served as a medium that could transmit disturbances. He began referring
to this as a new way to conceive of an ether.“I agree with you that the
general relativity theory admits of an ether hypothesis,” he wrote
Lorentz in 1916.21</p>
<p>In a lecture in Leiden in May 1920, Einstein publicly proposed a
reincarnation, though not a rebirth, of the ether. “More careful
reflection teaches us, however, that the special theory of relativity
does not compel us to deny ether,” he said. “We may assume the existence
of an ether, only we must give up ascribing a definite state of motion
to it.”</p>
<p>This revised view was justified, he said, by the results of the
general theory of relativity. He made clear that his new ether was
different from the old one, which had been conceived as a medium that
could ripple and thus explain how light waves moved through space.
Instead, he was reintroducing the idea in order to explain rotation and
inertia.</p>
<p>Perhaps he could have saved some confusion if he had chosen a
different term. But in his speech he made clear that he was
reintroducing the word intentionally:</p>
<p>To deny the ether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no
physical qualities whatever. The fundamental facts of mechanics do not
harmonize with this view . . . Besides observable objects, another
thing, which is not perceptible, must be looked upon as real, to enable
acceleration or rotation to be looked upon as something real . . . The
conception of the ether has again acquired an intelligible content,
although this content differs widely from that of the ether of the
mechanical wave theory of light … According to the general theory of
relativity, space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense,
there exists an ether. Space without ether is unthinkable; for in such
space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no
possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods
and clocks), nor therefore any spacetime intervals in the physical
sense. But this ether may not be thought of as endowed with the
qualities of ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be
tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it.22</p>
<p>So what was this reincarnated ether, and what did it mean for Mach’s
principle and for the question raised by Newton’s bucket?* Einstein had
initially enthused that general relativity explained rotation as being
simply a motion relative to other objects in space, just as Mach had
argued. In other words, if you were inside a bucket that was dangling in
empty space, with no other objects in the universe, there would be no
way to tell if you were spinning or not. Einstein even wrote to Mach
saying he should be pleased that his principle was supported by general
relativity.</p>
<p>Einstein had asserted this claim in a letter to Schwarzschild, the
brilliant young scientist who had written to him from Germany’s Russian
front during the war about the cosmological implications of general
relativity. “Inertia is simply an interaction between masses, not an
effect in which ‘space’ of itself is involved, separate from the
observed mass,” Einstein had declared.23 But Schwarzschild disagreed
with that assessment.</p>
<p>And now, four years later, Einstein had changed his mind. In his
Leiden speech, unlike in his 1916 interpretation of general relativity,
Einstein accepted that his gravitational field theory implied that empty
space had physical qualities. The mechanical behavior of an object
hovering in empty space, like Newton’s bucket, “depends not only on
relative velocities but also on its state of rotation.” And that meant
“space is endowed with physical qualities.”</p>
<p>As he admitted outright, this meant that he was now abandoning Mach’s
principle. Among other things, Mach’s idea that inertia is caused by the
presence of all of the distant bodies in the universe implied that these
bodies could instantly have an effect on an object, even though they
were far apart. Einstein’s theory of relativity did not accept instant
actions at a distance. Even gravity did not exert its force instantly,
but only through changes in the gravitational field that obeyed the
speed limit of light. “Inertial resistance to acceleration in relation
to distant masses supposes action at a distance,” Einstein lectured.
“Be-cause the modern physicist does not accept such a thing as action at
a distance, he comes back to the ether, which has to serve as medium for
the effects of inertia.”24</p>
<p>It is an issue that still causes dispute, but Einstein seemed to
believe, at least when he gave his Leiden lecture, that according to
general relativity as he now saw it, the water in Newton’s bucket would
be pushed up the walls even if it were spinning in a universe devoid of
any other objects. “In contradiction to what Mach would have predicted,”
Brian Greene writes, “even in an otherwise empty universe, you will feel
pressed against the inner wall of the spinning bucket . . . In general
relativity, empty spacetime provides a benchmark for accelerated
motion.”25</p>
<p>The inertia pushing the water up the wall was caused by its rotation
with respect to the metric field, which Einstein now reincarnated as an
ether. As a result, he had to face the possibility that general
relativity did not necessarily eliminate the concept of absolute motion,
at least with respect to the metric of spacetime.26</p>
<p>It was not exactly a retreat, nor was it a return to the
nineteenth-century concept of the ether. But it was a more conservative
way of looking at the universe, and it represented a break from the
radicalism of Mach that Einstein had once embraced.</p>
<p>This clearly made Einstein uncomfortable. The best way to eliminate
the need for an ether that existed separately from matter, he concluded,
would be to find his elusive unified field theory. What a glory that
would be! “The contrast between ether and matter would fade away,” he
said, “and, through the general theory of relativity, the whole of
physics would become a complete system of thought.”27</p>
<p>Niels Bohr, Lasers, and “Chance”</p>
<p>By far the most important manifestation of Einstein’s midlife
transition from a revolutionary to a conservative was his hardening
attitude toward quantum theory, which in the mid-1920s produced a
radical new system of mechanics. His qualms about this new quantum
mechanics, and his search for a unifying theory that would reconcile it
with relativity and restore certainty to nature, would dominate—and to
some extent diminish—the second half of his scientific career.</p>
<p>He had once been a fearless quantum pioneer. Together with Max
Planck, he launched the revolution at the beginning of the century;
unlike Planck, he had been one of the few scientists who truly believed
in the physical reality of quanta—that light actually came in packets of
energy. These quanta behaved at times like particles. They were
indivisible units, not part of a continuum.</p>
<p>In his 1909 Salzburg address, he had predicted that physics would
have to reconcile itself to a duality in which light could be regarded
as both wave and particle. And at the first Solvay Conference in 1911,
he had declared that “these discontinuities, which we find so
distasteful in Planck’s theory, seem really to exist in nature.”28</p>
<p>This caused Planck, who resisted the notion that his quanta actually
had a physical reality, to say of Einstein, in his recommendation that
he be elected to the Prussian Academy, “His hypothesis of light quanta
may have gone overboard.” Other scientists likewise resisted Einstein’s
quantum hypothesis. Walther Nernst called it “probably the strangest
thing ever thought up,” and Robert Millikan called it “wholly
untenable,” even after confirming its predictive power in his lab.29</p>
<p>A new phase of the quantum revolution was launched in 1913, when
Niels Bohr came up with a revised model for the structure of the atom.
Six years younger than Einstein, brilliant yet rather shy and
inarticulate, Bohr was Danish and thus able to draw from the work on
quantum theory being done by Germans such as Planck and Einstein and
also from the work on the structure of the atom being done by the
Englishmen J. J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford. “At the time, quantum
theory was a German invention which had scarcely penetrated to England
at all,” recalled Arthur Eddington.30</p>
<p>Bohr had gone to study with Thomson in Cambridge. But the mumbling
Dane and brusque Brit had trouble communicating. So Bohr migrated up to
Manchester to work with the more gregarious Rutherford, who had devised
a model of the atom that featured a positively charged nucleus around
which tiny negatively charged electrons orbited.31</p>
<p>Bohr made a refinement based on the fact that these electrons did not
collapse into the nucleus and emit a continuous spectrum of radiation,
as classical physics would suggest. In Bohr’s new model, which was based
on studying the hydrogen atom, an electron circled a nucleus at certain
permitted orbits in states with discrete energies. The atom could absorb
energy from radiation (such as light) only in increments that would kick
the electron up a notch to another permitted orbit. Likewise, the atom
could emit radiation only in increments that would drop the electron
down to another permitted orbit.</p>
<p>When an electron moved from one orbit to the next, it was a quantum
leap. In other words, it was a disconnected and discontinuous shift from
one level to another, with no meandering in between. Bohr went on to
show how this model accounted for the lines in the spectrum of light
emitted by the hydrogen atom.</p>
<p>Einstein was both impressed and a little jealous when he heard of
Bohr’s theory. As one scientist reported to Rutherford, “He told me that
he had once similar ideas but he did not dare to publish them.” Einstein
later declared of Bohr’s discovery, “This is the highest form of
musicality in the sphere of thought.”32</p>
<p>Einstein used Bohr’s model as the foundation for a series of papers
in 1916, the most important of which, “On the Quantum Theory of
Radiation,” was also formally published in a journal in 1917.33</p>
<p>Einstein began with a thought experiment in which a chamber is filled
with a cloud of atoms. They are being bathed by light (or any form of
electromagnetic radiation). Einstein then combined Bohr’s model of the
atom with Max Planck’s theory of the quanta. If each change in an
electron orbit corresponded to the absorption or emission of one light
quantum, then—presto!—it resulted in a new and better way to derive
Planck’s formula for explaining blackbody radiation. As Einstein boasted
to Michele Besso, “A brilliant idea dawned on me about radiation
absorption and emission. It will interest you. An astonishingly simple
derivation, I should say the derivation of Planck’s formula. A
thoroughly quantized affair.”34</p>
<p>Atoms emit radiation in a spontaneous fashion, but Einstein theorized
that this process could also be stimulated. A roughly simplified way to
picture this is to suppose that an atom is already in a high-energy
state from having absorbed a photon. If another photon with a particular
wavelength is then fired into it, two photons of the same wavelength and
direction can be emitted.</p>
<p>What Einstein discovered was slightly more complex. Suppose there is
a gas of atoms with energy being pumped into it, say by pulses of
electricity or light. Many of the atoms will absorb energy and go into a
higher energy state, and they will begin to emit photons. Einstein
argued that the presence of this cloud of photons made it even more
likely that a photon of the same wavelength and direction as the other
photons in the cloud would be emitted.35 This process of stimulated
emission would, almost forty years later, be the basis for the invention
of the laser, an acronym for “light amplification by the stimulated
emission of radiation.”</p>
<p>There was one part of Einstein’s quantum theory of radiation that had
strange ramifications. “It can be demonstrated convincingly,” he told
Besso, “that the elementary processes of emission and absorption are
directed processes.”36 In other words, when a photon pulses out of an
atom, it does not do so (as the classical wave theory would have it) in
all directions at once. Instead, a photon has momentum. In other words,
the equations work only if each quantum of radiation is emitted in some
particular direction.</p>
<p>That was not necessarily a problem. But here was the rub:there was no
way to determine which direction an emitted photon might go. In
addition, there was no way to determine when it would happen. If an atom
was in a state of higher energy, it was possible to calculate the
probability that it would emit a photon at any specific moment. But it
was not possible to determine the moment of emission precisely. Nor was
it possible to determine the direction. No matter how much information
you had. It was all a matter of chance, like the roll of dice.</p>
<p>That was a problem. It threatened the strict determinism of Newton’s
mechanics. It undermined the certainty of classical physics and the
faith that if you knew all the positions and velocities in a system you
could determine its future. Relativity may have seemed like a radical
idea, but at least it preserved rigid cause-and-effect rules. The quirky
and unpredictable behavior of pesky quanta, however, was messing with
this causality.</p>
<p>“It is a weakness of the theory,” Einstein conceded, “that it leaves
the time and direction of the elementary process to ‘chance.’” The whole
concept of chance—“Zufall” was the word he used—was so disconcerting to
him, so odd, that he put the word in quotation marks, as if to distance
himself from it.37</p>
<p>For Einstein, and indeed for most classical physicists, the idea that
there could be a fundamental randomness in the universe—that events
could just happen without a cause—was not only a cause of discomfort, it
undermined the entire program of physics. Indeed, he never would become
reconciled to it. “The thing about causality plagues me very much,” he
wrote Max Born in 1920. “Is the quantumlike absorption and emission of
light ever conceivable in terms of complete causality?”38</p>
<p>For the rest of his life, Einstein would remain resistant to the
notion that probabilities and uncertainties ruled nature in the realm of
quantum mechanics. “I find the idea quite intolerable that an electron
exposed to radiation should choose of its own free will not only its
moment to jump off but also its direction,” he despaired to Born a few
years later. “In that case, I would rather be a cobbler, or even an
employee of a gaming house, than a physicist.”39</p>
<p>Philosophically, Einstein’s reaction seemed to be an echo of the
attitude displayed by the antirelativists, who interpreted (or
misinterpreted) Einstein’s relativity theory as meaning an end to the
certainties and absolutes in nature. In fact, Einstein saw relativity
theory as leading to a deeper description of certainties and
absolutes—what he called invariances—based on the combination of space
and time into one four-dimensional fabric. Quantum mechanics, on the
other hand, would be based on true underlying uncertainties in nature,
events that could be described only in terms of probabilities.</p>
<p>On a visit to Berlin in 1920, Niels Bohr, who had become the
Copenhagen-based ringleader of the quantum mechanics movement, met
Einstein for the first time. Bohr arrived at Einstein’s apartment
bearing Danish cheese and butter, and then he launched into a discussion
of the role that chance and probability played in quantum mechanics.
Einstein expressed his wariness of “abandoning continuity and
causality.” Bohr was bolder about going into that misty realm.
Abandoning strict causality, he countered to Einstein, was “the only way
open” given the evidence.</p>
<p>Einstein admitted that he was impressed, but also worried, by Bohr’s
breakthroughs on the structure of the atom and the randomness it implied
for the quantum nature of radiation. “I could probably have arrived at
something like this myself,” Einstein lamented, “but if all this is true
then it means the end of physics.”40</p>
<p>Although Einstein found Bohr’s ideas disconcerting, he found the
gangly and informal Dane personally endearing. “Not often in life has a
human being caused me such joy by his mere presence as you did,” he
wrote Bohr right after the visit, adding that he took pleasure in
picturing “your cheerful boyish face.” He was equally effusive behind
Bohr’s back.“Bohr was here, and I am just as keen on him as you are,” he
wrote their mutual friend Ehrenfest in Leiden. “He is an extremely
sensitive lad and moves around in this world as if in a trance.”41</p>
<p>Bohr, for his part, revered Einstein. When it was announced in 1922
that they had won sequential Nobel Prizes, Bohr wrote that his own joy
had been heightened by the fact that Einstein had been recognized first
for “the fundamental contribution that you made to the special field in
which I am working.”42</p>
<p>On his journey home from delivering his acceptance speech in Sweden
the following summer, Einstein stopped in Copenhagen to see Bohr, who
met him at the train station to take him home by streetcar. On the ride,
they got into a debate. “We took the streetcar and talked so animatedly
that we went much too far,” Bohr recalled. “We got off and traveled
back, but again rode too far.” Neither seemed to mind, for the
conversation was so engrossing. “We rode to and fro,” according to Bohr,
“and I can well imagine what the people thought about us.”43</p>
<p>More than just a friendship, their relationship became an
intellectual entanglement that began with divergent views about quantum
mechanics but then expanded into related issues of science, knowledge,
and philosophy. “In all the history of human thought, there is no
greater dialogue than that which took place over the years between Niels
Bohr and Albert Einstein about the meaning of the quantum,” says the
physicist John Wheeler, who studied under Bohr. The social philosopher
C. P. Snow went further. “No more profound intellectual debate has ever
been conducted,” he proclaimed.44</p>
<p>Their dispute went to the fundamental heart of the design of the
cosmos: Was there an objective reality that existed whether or not we
could ever observe it? Were there laws that restored strict causality to
phenomena that seemed inherently random? Was everything in the universe
predetermined?</p>
<p>For the rest of their lives, Bohr would sputter and fret at his
repeated failures to convert Einstein to quantum mechanics.Einstein,
Einstein, Einstein, he would mutter after each infuriating encounter.
But it was a discussion that was conducted with deep affection and even
great humor. On one of the many occasions when Einstein declared that
God would not play dice, it was Bohr who countered with the famous
rejoinder: Einstein, stop telling God what to do!45</p>
<p>Quantum Leaps</p>
<p>Unlike the development of relativity theory, which was largely the
product of one man working in near solitary splendor, the development of
quantum mechanics from 1924 to 1927 came from a burst of activity by a
clamorous congregation of young Turks who worked both in parallel and in
collaboration. They built on the foundations laid by Planck and
Einstein, who continued to resist the radical ramifications of the
quanta, and on the breakthroughs by Bohr, who served as a mentor for the
new generation.</p>
<p>Louis de Broglie, who carried the title of prince by virtue of being
related to the deposed French royal family, studied history in hopes of
being a civil servant. But after college, he became fascinated by
physics. His doctoral dissertation in 1924 helped transform the field.
If a wave can behave like a particle, he asked, shouldn’t a particle
also behave like a wave?</p>
<p>In other words, Einstein had said that light should be regarded not
only as a wave but also as a particle. Likewise, according to de
Broglie, a particle such as an electron could also be regarded as a
wave. “I had a sudden inspiration,” de Broglie later recalled.
“Einstein’s wave-particle dualism was an absolutely general phenomenon
extending to all of physical nature, and that being the case the motion
of all particles—photons, electrons, protons or any other—must be
associated with the propagation of a wave.”46</p>
<p>Using Einstein’s law of the photoelectric affect, de Broglie showed
that the wavelength associated with an electron (or any particle) would
be related to Planck’s constant divided by the particle’s momentum. It
turns out to be an incredibly tiny wavelength, which means that it’s
usually relevant only to particles in the subatomic realm, not to such
things as pebbles or planets or baseballs.*</p>
<p>In Bohr’s model of the atom, electrons could change their orbits (or,
more precisely, their stable standing wave patterns) only by certain
quantum leaps. De Broglie’s thesis helped explain this by conceiving of
electrons not just as particles but also as waves. Those waves are
strung out over the circular path around the nucleus. This works only if
the circle accommodates a whole number—such as 2 or 3 or 4—of the
particle’s wavelengths; it won’t neatly fit in the prescribed circle if
there’s a fraction of a wavelength left over.</p>
<p>De Broglie made three typed copies of his thesis and sent one to his
adviser, Paul Langevin, who was Einstein’s friend (and Madame Curie’s).
Langevin, somewhat baffled, asked for another copy to send along to
Einstein, who praised the work effusively. It had, Einstein said,
“lifted a corner of the great veil.” As de Broglie proudly noted, “This
made Langevin accept my work.”47</p>
<p>Einstein made his own contribution when he received in June of that
year a paper in English from a young physicist from India named
Satyendra Nath Bose. It derived Planck’s blackbody radiation law by
treating radiation as if it were a cloud of gas and then applying a
statistical method of analyzing it. But there was a twist: Bose said
that any two photons that had the same energy state were absolutely
indistinguishable, in theory as well as fact, and should not be treated
separately in the statistical calculations.</p>
<p>Bose’s creative use of statistical analysis was reminiscent of
Einstein’s youthful enthusiasm for that approach. He not only got Bose’s
paper published, he also extended it with three papers of his own. In
them, he applied Bose’s counting method, later called “Bose-Einstein
statistics,” to actual gas molecules, thus becoming the primary inventor
of quantum-statistical mechanics.</p>
<p>Bose’s paper dealt with photons, which have no mass. Einstein
extended the idea by treating quantum particles with mass as being
indistinguishable from one another for statistical purposes in certain
cases. “The quanta or molecules are not treated as structures
statistically independent of one another,” he wrote.48</p>
<p>The key insight, which Einstein extracted from Bose’s initial paper,
has to do with how you calculate the probabilities for each possible
state of multiple quantum particles. To use an analogy suggested by the
Yale physicist Douglas Stone, imagine how this calculation is done for
dice. In calculating the odds that the roll of two dice (A and B) will
produce a lucky 7, we treat the possibility that A comes up 4 and B
comes up 3 as one outcome, and we treat the possibility that A comes up
3 and B comes up 4 as a different outcome—thus counting each of these
combinations as different ways to produce a 7. Einstein realized that
the new way of calculating the odds of quantum states involved treating
these not as two different possibilities, but only as one. A 4-3
combination was indistinguishable from a 3-4 combination; likewise, a
5-2 combination was indistinguishable from a 2-5.</p>
<p>That cuts in half the number of ways two dice can roll a 7. But it
does not affect the number of ways they could turn up a 2 or a 12 (using
either counting method, there is only one way to roll each of these
totals), and it only reduces from five to three the number of ways the
two dice could total 6. A few minutes of jotting down possible outcomes
shows how this system changes the overall odds of rolling any particular
number. The changes wrought by this new calculating method are even
greater if we are applying it to dozens of dice. And if we are dealing
with billions of particles, the change in probabilities becomes
huge.</p>
<p>When he applied this approach to a gas of quantum particles, Einstein
discovered an amazing property: unlike a gas of classical particles,
which will remain a gas unless the particles attract one another, a gas
of quantum particles can condense into some kind of liquid even without
a force of attraction between them.</p>
<p>This phenomenon, now called Bose-Einstein condensation,* was a
brilliant and important discovery in quantum mechanics, and Einstein
deserves most of the credit for it. Bose had not quite realized that the
statistical mathematics he used represented a fundamentally new
approach. As with the case of Planck’s constant, Einstein recognized the
physical reality, and the significance, of a contrivance that someone
else had devised.49</p>
<p>Einstein’s method had the effect of treating particles as if they had
wavelike traits, as both he and de Broglie had suggested. Einstein even
predicted that if you did Thomas Young’s old double-slit experiment
(showing that light behaved like a wave by shining a beam through two
slits and noting the interference pattern) by using a beam of gas
molecules, they would interfere with one another as if they were waves.
“A beam of gas molecules which passes through an aperture,” he wrote,
“must undergo a diffraction analogous to that of a light ray.”50</p>
<p>Amazingly, experiments soon showed that to be true. Despite his
discomfort with the direction quantum theory was heading, Einstein was
still helping, at least for the time being, to push it ahead. “Einstein
is thereby clearly involved in the foundation of wave mechanics,” his
friend Max Born later said, “and no alibi can disprove it.”51</p>
<p>Einstein admitted that he found this “mutual influence” of particles
to be “quite mysterious,” for they seemed as if they should behave
independently. “The quanta or molecules are not treated as independent
of one another,” he wrote another physicist who expressed bafflement. In
a postscript he admitted that it all worked well mathematically, but
“the physical nature remains veiled.”52</p>
<p>On the surface, this assumption that two particles could be treated
as indistinguishable violated a principle that Einstein would
nevertheless try to cling to in the future: the principle of
separability, which as serts that particles with different locations in
space have separate, independent realities. One aim of general
relativity’s theory of gravity had been to avoid any “spooky action at a
distance,” as Einstein famously called it later, in which something
happening to one body could instantly affect another distant body.</p>
<p>Once again, Einstein was at the forefront of discovering an aspect of
quantum theory that would cause him discomfort in the future. And once
again, younger colleagues would embrace his ideas more readily than he
would—just as he had once embraced the implications of the ideas of
Planck, Poincaré, and Lorentz more readily than they had.53</p>
<p>An additional step was taken by another unlikely player, Erwin
Schrödinger, an Austrian theoretical physicist who despaired of
discovering anything significant and thus decided to concentrate on
being a philosopher instead. But the world apparently already had enough
Austrian philosophers, and he couldn’t find work in that field. So he
stuck with physics and, inspired by Einstein’s praise of de Broglie,
came up with a theory called “wave mechanics.” It led to a set of
equations that governed de Broglie’s wavelike behavior of electrons,
which Schrödinger (giving half credit where he thought it was due)
called “Einstein–de Broglie waves.”54</p>
<p>Einstein expressed enthusiasm at first, but he soon became troubled
by some of the ramifications of Schrödinger’s waves, most notably that
over time they can spread over an enormous area. An electron could not,
in reality, be waving thus, Einstein thought. So what, in the real
world, did the wave equation really represent?</p>
<p>The person who helped answer that question was Max Born, Einstein’s
close friend and (along with his wife, Hedwig) frequent correspondent,
who was then teaching at Göttingen. Born proposed that the wave did not
describe the behavior of the particle. Instead, he said that it
described the probability of its location at any moment.55 It was an
approach that revealed quantum mechanics as being, even more than
previously thought, fundamentally based on chance rather than causal
certainties, and it made Einstein even more squeamish.56</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another approach to quantum mechanics had been developed
in the summer of 1925 by a bright-faced 23-year-old hiking enthusiast,
Werner Heisenberg, who was a student of Niels Bohr in Copenhagen and
then of Max Born in Göttingen. As Einstein had done in his more radical
youth, Heisenberg started by embracing Ernst Mach’s dictum that theories
should avoid any concepts that cannot be observed, measured, or
verified. For Heisenberg this meant avoiding the concept of electron
orbits, which could not be observed.</p>
<p>He relied instead on a mathematical approach that would account for
something that could be observed: the wavelengths of the spectral lines
of the radiation from these electrons as they lost energy. The result
was so complex that Heisenberg gave his paper to Born and left on a
camping trip with fellow members of his youth group, hoping that his
mentor could figure it out. Born did. The math involved what are known
as matrices, and Born sorted it all out and got the paper published.57
In collaboration with Born and others in Göttingen, Heisenberg went on
to perfect a matrix mechanics that was later shown to be equivalent to
Schrödinger’s wave mechanics.</p>
<p>Einstein politely wrote Born’s wife, Hedwig, “The Heisenberg-Born
concepts leave us breathless.” Those carefully couched words can be read
in a variety of ways. Writing to Ehrenfest in Leiden, Einstein was more
blunt. “Heisenberg has laid a big quantum egg,” he wrote. “In Göttingen
they believe in it. I don’t.”58</p>
<p>Heisenberg’s more famous and disruptive contribution came two years
later, in 1927. It is, to the general public, one of the best known and
most baffling aspects of quantum physics: the uncertainty principle.</p>
<p>It is impossible to know, Heisenberg declared, the precise position
of a particle, such as a moving electron, and its precise momentum (its
velocity times its mass) at the same instant. The more precisely the
position of the particle is measured, the less precisely it is possible
to measure its momentum. And the formula that describes the trade-off
involves (no surprise) Planck’s constant.</p>
<p>The very act of observing something—of allowing photons or electrons
or any other particles or waves of energy to strike the object—affects
the observation. But Heisenberg’s theory went beyond that. An electron
does not have a definite position or path until we observe it. This is a
feature of our universe, he said, not merely some defect in our
observing or measuring abilities.</p>
<p>The uncertainty principle, so simple and yet so startling, was a
stake in the heart of classical physics. It asserts that there is no
objective reality—not even an objective position of a particle—outside
of our observations. In addition, Heisenberg’s principle and other
aspects of quantum mechanics undermine the notion that the universe
obeys strict causal laws. Chance, indeterminacy, and probability took
the place of certainty. When Einstein wrote him a note objecting to
these features, Heisenberg replied bluntly, “I believe that
indeterminism, that is, the nonvalidity of rigorous causality, is
necessary.”59</p>
<p>When Heisenberg came to give a lecture in Berlin in 1926, he met
Einstein for the first time. Einstein invited him over to his house one
evening, and there they engaged in a friendly argument. It was the
mirror of the type of argument Einstein might have had in 1905 with
conservatives who resisted his dismissal of the ether.</p>
<p>“We cannot observe electron orbits inside the atom,” Heisenberg
said.“A good theory must be based on directly observable
magnitudes.”</p>
<p>“But you don’t seriously believe,” Einstein protested, “that none but
observable magnitudes must go into a physical theory?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that precisely what you have done with relativity?” Heisenberg
asked with some surprise.</p>
<p>“Possibly I did use this kind of reasoning,” Einstein admitted, “but
it is nonsense all the same.”60</p>
<p>In other words, Einstein’s approach had evolved.</p>
<p>Einstein had a similar conversation with his friend in Prague,
Philipp Frank. “A new fashion has arisen in physics,” Einstein
complained, which declares that certain things cannot be observed and
therefore should not be ascribed reality.</p>
<p>“But the fashion you speak of,” Frank protested, “was invented by you
in 1905!”</p>
<p>Replied Einstein: “A good joke should not be repeated too
often.”61</p>
<p>The theoretical advances that occurred in the mid-1920s were shaped
by Niels Bohr and his colleagues, including Heisenberg, into what became
known as the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. A property
of an object can be discussed only in the context of how that property
is observed or measured, and these observations are not simply aspects
of a single picture but are complementary to one another.</p>
<p>In other words, there is no single underlying reality that is
independent of our observations. “It is wrong to think that the task of
physics is to find out how nature is,” Bohr declared. “Physics concerns
what we can say about nature.”62</p>
<p>This inability to know a so-called “underlying reality” meant that
there was no strict determinism in the classical sense. “When one wishes
to calculate ‘the future’ from ‘the present’ one can only get
statistical results,” Heisenberg said, “since one can never discover
every detail of the present.”63</p>
<p>As this revolution climaxed in the spring of 1927, Einstein used the
200th anniversary of Newton’s death to defend the classical system of
mechanics based on causality and certainty. Two decades earlier,
Einstein had, with youthful insouciance, toppled many of the pillars of
Newton’s universe, including absolute space and time. But now he was a
defender of the established order, and of Newton.</p>
<p>In the new quantum mechanics, he said, strict causality seemed to
disappear. “But the last word has not been said,” Einstein argued. “May
the spirit of Newton’s method give us the power to restore union between
physical reality and the profoundest characteristic of Newton’s
teaching—strict causality.”64</p>
<p>Einstein never fully came around, even as experiments repeatedly
showed quantum mechanics to be valid. He remained a realist, one who
made it his creed to believe in an objective reality, rooted in
certainty, that existed whether or not we could observe it.</p>
<p>“He does not play dice”</p>
<p>So what made Einstein cede the revolutionary road to younger radicals
and spin into a defensive crouch?</p>
<p>As a young empiricist, excited by his readings of Ernst Mach,
Einstein had been willing to reject any concepts that could not be
observed, such as the ether and absolute time and space and
simultaneity. But the success of his general theory convinced him that
Mach’s skepticism, even though it might be useful for weeding out
superfluous concepts, did not provide much help in constructing new
theories.</p>
<p>“He rides Mach’s poor horse to exhaustion,” Einstein complained to
Michele Besso about a paper written by a mutual friend.</p>
<p>“We should not insult Mach’s poor horse,” Besso replied. “Didn’t it
make possible the tortuous journey through the relativities? And who
knows, in the case of the nasty quanta, it may also carry Don Quixote de
la Einsteina through it all!”</p>
<p>“You know what I think about Mach’s little horse,” Einstein wrote
Besso in return. “It cannot give birth to anything living. It can only
exterminate harmful vermin.”65</p>
<p>In his maturity, Einstein more firmly believed that there was an
objective “reality” that existed whether or not we could observe it. The
belief in an external world independent of the person observing it, he
repeatedly said, was the basis of all science.66</p>
<p>In addition, Einstein resisted quantum mechanics because it abandoned
strict causality and instead defined reality in terms of indeterminacy,
uncertainty, and probability. A true disciple of Hume would not have
been troubled by this. There is no real reason—other than either a
metaphysical faith or a habit ingrained in the mind—to believe that
nature must operate with absolute certainty. It is just as reasonable,
though perhaps less satisfying, to believe that some things simply
happen by chance. Certainly, there was mounting evidence that on the
subatomic level this was the case.</p>
<p>But for Einstein, this simply did not smell true. The ultimate goal
of physics, he repeatedly said, was to discover the laws that strictly
determine causes and effects. “I am very, very reluctant to give up
complete causality,” he told Max Born.67</p>
<p>His faith in determinism and causality reflected that of his favorite
religious philosopher, Baruch Spinoza. “He was utterly convinced,”
Einstein wrote of Spinoza, “of the causal dependence of all phenomena,
at a time when the success of efforts to achieve a knowledge of the
causal relationship of natural phenomena was still quite modest.”68 It
was a sentence that Einstein could have written about himself,
emphasizing the temporariness implied by the word “still,” after the
advent of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Like Spinoza, Einstein did not believe in a personal God who
interacted with man. But they both believed that a divine design was
reflected in the elegant laws that governed the way the universe
worked.</p>
<p>This was not merely some expression of faith. It was a principle that
Einstein elevated (as he had the relativity principle) to the level of a
postulate, one that guided him in his work. “When I am judging a
theory,” he told his friend Banesh Hoffmann, “I ask myself whether, if I
were God, I would have arranged the world in such a way.”</p>
<p>When he posed that question, there was one possibility that he simply
could not believe: that the good Lord would have created beautiful and
subtle rules that determined most of what happened in the universe,
while leaving a few things completely to chance. It felt wrong. “If the
Lord had wanted to do that, he would have done it thoroughly, and not
kept to a pattern . . . He would have gone the whole hog. In that case,
we wouldn’t have to look for laws at all.”69</p>
<p>This led to one of Einstein’s most famous quotes, written to Max
Born, the friend and physicist who would spar with him over three
decades on this topic. “Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing,”
Einstein said. “But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real
thing. The theory says a lot, but it does not really bring us any closer
to the secrets of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that He does
not play dice.”70</p>
<p>Thus it was that Einstein ended up deciding that quantum mechanics,
though it may not be wrong, was at least incomplete. There must be a
fuller explanation of how the universe operates, one that would
incorporate both relativity theory and quantum mechanics. In doing so,
it would not leave things to chance.</p>
