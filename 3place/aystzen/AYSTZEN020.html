<h4 id="chapter-seventeen-einsteins-god">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN EINSTEIN’S
GOD</h4>
<p>Santa Barbara beach, 1933</p>
<p>One evening in Berlin, Einstein and his wife were at a dinner party
when a guest expressed a belief in astrology. Einstein ridiculed the
notion as pure superstition. Another guest stepped in and similarly
disparaged religion. Belief in God, he insisted, was likewise a
superstition.</p>
<p>At this point the host tried to silence him by invoking the fact that
even Einstein harbored religious beliefs.</p>
<p>“It isn’t possible!” the skeptical guest said, turning to Einstein to
ask if he was, in fact, religious.</p>
<p>“Yes, you can call it that,” Einstein replied calmly. “Try and
penetrate with our limited means the secrets of nature and you will find
that, behind all the discernible laws and connections, there remains
something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this force
beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion. To that extent I
am, in fact, religious.”1</p>
<p>As a child, Einstein had gone through an ecstatic religious phase,
then rebelled against it. For the next three decades, he tended not to
pronounce much on the topic. But around the time he turned 50, he began
to articulate more clearly—in various essays, interviews, and
letters—his deepening appreciation of his Jewish heritage and, somewhat
separately, his belief in God, albeit a rather impersonal, deistic
concept of God.</p>
<p>There were probably many reasons for this, in addition to the natural
propensity toward reflections about the eternal that can occur at age
50. The kinship he felt with fellow Jews due to their continued
oppression reawakened some of his religious sentiments. But mainly, his
beliefs seemed to arise from the sense of awe and transcendent order
that he discovered through his scientific work.</p>
<p>Whether embracing the beauty of his gravitational field equations or
rejecting the uncertainty in quantum mechanics, he displayed a profound
faith in the orderliness of the universe. This served as a basis for his
scientific outlook—and also his religious outlook. “The highest
satisfaction of a scientific person,” he wrote in 1929, is to come to
the realization “that God Himself could not have arranged these
connections any other way than that which does exist, any more than it
would have been in His power to make four a prime number.”2</p>
<p>For Einstein, as for most people, a belief in something larger than
himself became a defining sentiment. It produced in him an admixture of
confidence and humility that was leavened by a sweet simplicity. Given
his proclivity toward being self-centered, these were welcome graces.
Along with his humor and self-awareness, they helped him to avoid the
pretense and pomposity that could have afflicted the most famous mind in
the world.</p>
<p>His religious feelings of awe and humility also informed his sense of
social justice. It impelled him to cringe at trappings of hierarchy or
class distinction, to eschew excess consumption and materialism, and to
dedicate himself to efforts on behalf of refugees and the oppressed.</p>
<p>Shortly after his fiftieth birthday, Einstein gave a remarkable
interview in which he was more revealing than he had ever been about his
religious thinking. It was with a pompous but ingratiating poet and
propagandist named George Sylvester Viereck, who had been born in
Germany, moved to America as a child, and then spent his life writing
gaudily erotic poetry, interviewing great men, and expressing his
complex love for his fatherland.</p>
<p>Having bagged interviews with people ranging from Freud to Hitler to
the kaiser, which he would eventually publish as a book called Glimpses
of the Great, he was able to secure an appointment to talk to Einstein
in his Berlin apartment. There Elsa served raspberry juice and fruit
salad; then the two men went up to Einstein’s hermitage study. For
reasons not quite clear, Einstein assumed Viereck was Jewish. In fact,
Viereck proudly traced his lineage to the family of the kaiser, and he
would later become a Nazi sympathizer who was jailed in America during
World War II for being a German propagandist.3</p>
<p>Viereck began by asking Einstein whether he considered himself a
German or a Jew. “It’s possible to be both,” replied Einstein.
“Nationalism is an infantile disease, the measles of mankind.”</p>
<p>Should Jews try to assimilate? “We Jews have been too eager to
sacrifice our idiosyncrasies in order to conform.”</p>
<p>To what extent are you influenced by Christianity? “As a child I
received instruction both in the Bible and in the Talmud. I am a Jew,
but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene.”</p>
<p>You accept the historical existence of Jesus? “Unquestionably! No one
can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His
personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such
life.”</p>
<p>Do you believe in God? “I’m not an atheist. The problem involved is
too vast for our limited minds. We are in the position of a little child
entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child
knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. It
does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child
dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but
doesn’t know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even
the most intelligent human being toward God. We see the universe
marvelously arranged and obeying certain laws but only dimly understand
these laws.”</p>
<p>Is this a Jewish concept of God? “I am a determinist. I do not
believe in free will. Jews believe in free will. They believe that man
shapes his own life. I reject that doctrine. In that respect I am not a
Jew.”</p>
<p>Is this Spinoza’s God? “I am fascinated by Spinoza’s pantheism, but I
admire even more his contribution to modern thought because he is the
first philosopher to deal with the soul and body as one, and not two
separate things.”</p>
<p>How did he get his ideas? “I’m enough of an artist to draw freely on
my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge
is limited. Imagination encircles the world.”</p>
<p>Do you believe in immortality? “No. And one life is enough for
me.”4</p>
<p>Einstein tried to express these feelings clearly, both for himself
and all of those who wanted a simple answer from him about his faith. So
in the summer of 1930, amid his sailing and ruminations in Caputh, he
composed a credo, “What I Believe.” It concluded with an explanation of
what he meant when he called himself religious:</p>
<p>The most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mysterious. It is
the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of all true art and
science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder
and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead, a snuffed-out candle. To
sense that behind anything that can be experienced there is something
that our minds cannot grasp, whose beauty and sublimity reaches us only
indirectly: this is religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense
only, I am a devoutly religious man.5</p>
<p>People found it evocative, even inspiring, and it was reprinted
repeatedly in a variety of translations. But not surprisingly, it did
not satisfy those who wanted a simple, direct answer to the question of
whether he believed in God. As a result, getting Einstein to answer that
question concisely replaced the earlier frenzy of trying to get him to
give a one-sentence explanation of relativity.</p>
<p>A Colorado banker wrote that he had already gotten responses from
twenty-four Nobel Prize winners to the question of whether they believed
in God, and he asked Einstein to reply as well. “I cannot conceive of a
personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals or
would sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation,” Einstein
scribbled on the letter. “My religiosity consists of a humble admiration
of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that
we can comprehend about the knowable world. That deeply emotional
conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is
revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God.”6</p>
<p>A little girl in the sixth grade of a Sunday school in New York posed
the question in a slightly different form. “Do scientists pray?” she
asked. Einstein took her seriously. “Scientific research is based on the
idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature,
and this holds for the actions of people,” he explained. “For this
reason, a scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could
be influenced by a prayer, i.e. by a wish addressed to a supernatural
Being.”</p>
<p>That did not mean, however, there was no Almighty, no spirit larger
than ourselves. As he went on to explain to the young girl:</p>
<p>Every one who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes
convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe—a spirit
vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our
modest powers must feel humble. In this way the pursuit of science leads
to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is indeed quite
different from the religiosity of someone more naïve.7</p>
<p>For some, only a clear belief in a personal God who controls our
daily lives qualified as a satisfactory answer, and Einstein’s ideas
about an impersonal cosmic spirit, as well as his theories of
relativity, deserved to be labeled for what they were. “I very seriously
doubt that Einstein himself really knows what he is driving at,”
Boston’s Cardinal William Henry O’Connell said. But one thing seemed
clear. It was godless. “The outcome of this doubt and befogged
speculation about time and space is a cloak beneath which hides the
ghastly apparition of atheism.”8</p>
<p>This public blast from a cardinal prompted the noted Orthodox Jewish
leader in New York, Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein, to send a very direct
telegram: “Do you believe in God? Stop. Answer paid. 50 words.” Einstein
used only about half his allotted number of words. It became the most
famous version of an answer he gave often: “I believe in Spinoza’s God,
who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of all that exists, but not in
a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of
mankind.”9</p>
<p>Einstein’s response was not comforting to everyone. Some religious
Jews, for example, noted that Spinoza had been excommunicated from the
Jewish community of Amsterdam for holding these beliefs, and he had also
been condemned by the Catholic Church for good measure. “Cardinal
O’Connell would have done well had he not attacked the Einstein theory,”
said one Bronx rabbi. “Einstein would have done better had he not
proclaimed his nonbelief in a God who is concerned with fates and
actions of individuals. Both have handed down dicta outside their
jurisdiction.”10</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most people were satisfied, whether they fully agreed
or not, because they could appreciate what he was saying. The idea of an
impersonal God, whose hand is reflected in the glory of creation but who
does not meddle in daily existence, is part of a respectable tradition
in both Europe and America. It is to be found in some of Einstein’s
favorite philosophers, and it generally accords with the religious
beliefs of many of America’s founders, such as Jefferson and
Franklin.</p>
<p>Some religious believers dismiss Einstein’s frequent invocations of
God as a mere figure of speech. So do some nonbelievers. There were many
phrases he used, some of them playful, ranging from der Herrgott (the
Lord God) to der Alte (the Old One). But it was not Einstein’s style to
speak disingenuously in order to appear to conform. In fact, just the
opposite. So we should do him the honor of taking him at his word when
he insists, repeatedly, that these oft-used phrases were not merely a
semantic way of disguising that he was actually an atheist.</p>
<p>Throughout his life, he was consistent in deflecting the charge that
he was an atheist. “There are people who say there is no God,” he told a
friend. “But what makes me really angry is that they quote me for
support of such views.”11</p>
<p>Unlike Sigmund Freud or Bertrand Russell or George Bernard Shaw,
Einstein never felt the urge to denigrate those who believe in God;
instead, he tended to denigrate atheists. “What separates me from most
so-called atheists is a feeling of utter humility toward the
unattainable secrets of the harmony of the cosmos,” he explained.12</p>
<p>In fact, Einstein tended to be more critical of the debunkers, who
seemed to lack humility or a sense of awe, than of the faithful. “The
fanatical atheists,” he explained in a letter, “are like slaves who are
still feeling the weight of their chains which they have thrown off
after hard struggle. They are creatures who—in their grudge against
traditional religion as the ‘opium of the masses’—cannot hear the music
of the spheres.”13</p>
<p>Einstein would later engage in an exchange on this topic with a U.S.
Navy ensign he had never met. Was it true, the sailor asked, that
Einstein had been converted by a Jesuit priest into believing in God?
That was absurd, Einstein replied. He went on to say that he considered
the belief in a God who was a fatherlike figure to be the result of
“childish analogies.” Would Einstein permit him, the sailor asked, to
quote his reply in his debates against his more religious shipmates?
Einstein warned him not to oversimplify. “You may call me an agnostic,
but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist
whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the
fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth,” he explained. “I
prefer the attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our
intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being.”14</p>
<p>How did this religious instinct relate to his science? For Einstein,
the beauty of his faith was that it informed and inspired, rather than
conflicted with, his scientific work. “The cosmic religious feeling,” he
said, “is the strongest and noblest motive for scientific
research.”15</p>
<p>Einstein later explained his view of the relationship between science
and religion at a conference on that topic at the Union Theological
Seminary in New York. The realm of science, he said, was to ascertain
what was the case, but not evaluate human thoughts and actions about
what should be the case. Religion had the reverse mandate. Yet the
endeavors worked together at times. “Science can be created only by
those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and
understanding,” he said. “This source of feeling, however, springs from
the sphere of religion.”</p>
<p>The talk got front-page news coverage, and his pithy conclusion
became famous: “The situation may be expressed by an image: science
without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.”</p>
<p>But there was one religious concept, Einstein went on to say, that
science could not accept: a deity who could meddle at whim in the events
of his creation or in the lives of his creatures. “The main source of
the present-day conflicts between the spheres of religion and of science
lies in this concept of a personal God,” he argued. Scientists aim to
uncover the immutable laws that govern reality, and in doing so they
must reject the notion that divine will, or for that matter human will,
plays a role that would violate this cosmic causality.16</p>
<p>This belief in causal determinism, which was inherent in Einstein’s
scientific outlook, conflicted not only with the concept of a personal
God. It was also, at least in Einstein’s mind, incompatible with human
free will. Although he was a deeply moral man, his belief in strict
determinism made it difficult for him to accept the idea of moral choice
and individual responsibility that is at the heart of most ethical
systems.</p>
<p>Jewish as well as Christian theologians have generally believed that
people have this free will and are responsible for their actions. They
are even free to choose, as happens in the Bible, to defy God’s
commands, despite the fact that this seems to conflict with a belief
that God is all-knowing and all-powerful.</p>
<p>Einstein, on the other hand, believed, as did Spinoza,17 that a
person’s actions were just as determined as that of a billiard ball,
planet, or star. “Human beings in their thinking, feeling and acting are
not free but are as causally bound as the stars in their motions,”
Einstein declared in a statement to a Spinoza Society in 1932.18</p>
<p>Human actions are determined, beyond their control, by both physical
and psychological laws, he believed. It was a concept he drew also from
his reading of Schopenhauer, to whom he attributed, in his 1930 “What I
Believe” credo, a maxim along those lines:</p>
<p>I do not at all believe in free will in the philosophical sense.
Everybody acts not only under external compulsion but also in accordance
with inner necessity. Schopenhauer’s saying, “A man can do as he wills,
but not will as he wills,”19 has been a real inspiration to me since my
youth; it has been a continual consolation in the face of life’s
hardships, my own and others’, and an unfailing wellspring of
tolerance.20</p>
<p>Do you believe, Einstein was once asked, that humans are free agents?
“No, I am a determinist,” he replied. “Everything is determined, the
beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control.
It is determined for the insect as well as for the star. Human beings,
vegetables, or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned
in the distance by an invisible player.”21</p>
<p>This attitude appalled some friends, such as Max Born, who thought it
completely undermined the foundations of human morality. “I cannot
understand how you can combine an entirely mechanistic universe with the
freedom of the ethical individual,” he wrote Einstein. “To me a
deterministic world is quite abhorrent. Maybe you are right, and the
world is that way, as you say. But at the moment it does not really look
like it in physics—and even less so in the rest of the world.”</p>
<p>For Born, quantum uncertainty provided an escape from this dilemma.
Like some philosophers of the time, he latched on to the indeterminacy
that was inherent in quantum mechanics to resolve “the discrepancy
between ethical freedom and strict natural laws.”22 Einstein conceded
that quantum mechanics called into question strict determinism, but he
told Born he still believed in it, both in the realm of personal actions
and physics.</p>
<p>Born explained the issue to his high-strung wife, Hedwig, who was
always eager to debate Einstein. She told Einstein that, like him, she
was “unable to believe in a ‘dice-playing’ God.” In other words, unlike
her husband, she rejected quantum mechanics’ view that the universe was
based on uncertainties and probabilities. But, she added, “nor am I able
to imagine that you believe—as Max has told me—that your ‘complete rule
of law’ means that everything is predetermined, for example whether I am
going to have my child inoculated.”23 It would mean, she pointed out,
the end of all ethics.</p>
<p>In Einstein’s philosophy, the way to resolve this issue was to look
upon free will as something that was useful, indeed necessary, for a
civilized society, because it caused people to take responsibility for
their own actions. Acting as if people were responsible for their
actions would, psychologically and practically, prompt them to act in a
more responsible manner. “I am compelled to act as if free will
existed,” he explained, “because if I wish to live in a civilized
society I must act responsibly.” He could even hold people responsible
for their good or evil, since that was both a pragmatic and sensible
approach to life, while still believing intellectually that everyone’s
actions were predetermined. “I know that philosophically a murderer is
not responsible for his crime,” he said, “but I prefer not to take tea
with him.”24</p>
<p>In defense of Einstein, as well as of both Max and Hedwig Born, it
should be noted that philosophers through the ages have struggled,
sometimes awkwardly and not very successfully, to reconcile free will
with determinism and an all-knowing God. Whether Einstein was more or
less adept than others at grappling with this knot, there is one salient
fact about him that should be noted: he was able to develop, and to
practice, a strong personal morality, at least toward humanity in
general if not always toward members of his family, that was not
hampered by all these irresolvable philosophical speculations. “The most
important human endeavor is the striving for morality in our actions,”
he wrote a Brooklyn minister. “Our inner balance and even our existence
depend on it. Only morality in our actions can give beauty and dignity
to life.”25</p>
<p>The foundation of that morality, he believed, was rising above the
“merely personal” to live in a way that benefited humanity. There were
times when he could be callous to those closest to him, which shows
that, like the rest of us humans, he had flaws. Yet more than most
people, he dedicated himself honestly and sometimes courageously to
actions that he felt transcended selfish desires in order to encourage
human progress and the preservation of individual freedoms. He was
generally kind, good-natured, gentle, and unpretentious. When he and
Elsa left for Japan in 1922, he offered her daughters some advice on how
to lead a moral life. “Use for yourself little,” he said, “but give to
others much.”26</p>
