<h4 id="chapter-eleven-einsteins-universe">CHAPTER ELEVEN EINSTEIN’S
UNIVERSE</h4>
<p>1916–1919</p>
<p>In his Berlin home study</p>
<p>Cosmology and Black Holes, 1917</p>
<p>Cosmology is the study of the universe as a whole, including its size
and shape, its history and destiny, from one end to the other, from the
beginning to the end of time. That’s a big topic. And it’s not a simple
one. It’s not even simple to define what those concepts mean, or even if
they have meaning. With the gravitational field equations in his general
theory of relativity, Einstein laid the foundations for studying the
nature of the universe, thereby becoming the primary founder of modern
cosmology.</p>
<p>Helping him in this endeavor, at least in the early stages, was a
profound mathematician and even more distinguished astrophysicist, Karl
Schwarzschild, who directed the Potsdam Observatory. He read Einstein’s
new formulation of general relativity and, at the beginning of 1916, set
about trying to apply it to objects in space.</p>
<p>One thing made Schwarzschild’s work very difficult. He had
volunteered for the German military during the war, and when he read
Einstein’s papers he was stationed in Russia, projecting the trajectory
of artillery shells. Nevertheless, he was also able to find time to
calculate what the gravitational field would be, according to Einstein’s
theory, around an object in space. It was the wartime counterpart to
Einstein’s ability to come up with the special theory of relativity
while examining patent applications for the synchronization of
clocks.</p>
<p>In January 1916, Schwarzschild mailed his result to Einstein with the
declaration that it permitted his theory “to shine with increased
purity.” Among other things, it reconfirmed, with greater rigor, the
success of Einstein’s equations in explaining Mercury’s orbit. Einstein
was thrilled. “I would not have expected that the exact solution to the
problem could be formulated so simply,” he replied. The following
Thursday, he personally delivered the paper at the Prussian Academy’s
weekly meeting.1</p>
<p>Schwarzschild’s first calculations focused on the curvature of
space-time outside a spherical, nonspinning star. A few weeks later, he
sent Einstein another paper on what it would be like inside such a
star.</p>
<p>In both cases, something unusual seemed possible, indeed inevitable.
If all the mass of a star (or any object) was compressed into a tiny
enough space—defined by what became known as the Schwarzschild
radius—then all of the calculations seemed to break down. At the center,
spacetime would infinitely curve in on itself. For our sun, that would
happen if all of its mass were compressed into a radius of less than two
miles. For the earth, it would happen if all the mass were compressed
into a radius of about one-third of an inch.</p>
<p>What would that mean? In such a situation, nothing within the
Schwarzschild radius would be able to escape the gravitational pull, not
even light or any other form of radiation. Time would also be part of
the warpage as well, dilated to zero. In other words, a traveler nearing
the Schwarzschild radius would appear, to someone on the outside, to
freeze to a halt.</p>
<p>Einstein did not believe, then or later, that these results actually
corresponded to anything real. In 1939, for example, he produced a paper
that provided, he said, “a clear understanding as to why these
‘Schwarzschild singularities’ do not exist in physical reality.” A few
months later, however, J. Robert Oppenheimer and his student Hart-land
Snyder argued the opposite, predicting that stars could undergo a
gravitational collapse.2</p>
<p>As for Schwarzschild, he never had the chance to study the issue
further. Weeks after writing his papers, he contracted a horrible
auto-immune disease while on the front, which ate away at his skin
cells, and he died that May at age 42.</p>
<p>As scientists would discover after Einstein’s death, Schwarzschild’s
odd theory was right. Stars could collapse and create such a phenomenon,
and in fact they often did. In the 1960s, physicists such as Stephen
Hawking, Roger Penrose, John Wheeler, Freeman Dyson, and Kip Thorne
showed that this was indeed a feature of Einstein’s general theory of
relativity, one that was very real. Wheeler dubbed them “black holes,”
and they have been a feature of cosmology, as well as Star Trek
episodes, ever since.3</p>
<p>Black holes have now been discovered all over the universe, including
one at the center of our galaxy that is a few million times more massive
than our sun. “Black holes are not rare, and they are not an accidental
embellishment of our universe,” says Dyson. “They are the only places in
the universe where Einstein’s theory of relativity shows its full power
and glory. Here, and nowhere else, space and time lose their
individuality and merge together in a sharply curved four-dimensional
structure precisely delineated by Einstein’s equations.”4</p>
<p>Einstein believed that his general theory solved Newton’s bucket
issue in a way that Mach would have liked: inertia (or centrifugal
forces) would not exist for something spinning in a completely empty
universe.* Instead, inertia was caused only by rotation relative to all
the other objects in the universe. “According to my theory, inertia is
simply an interaction between masses, not an effect in which ‘space’ of
itself is involved, separate from the observed mass,” Einstein told
Schwarzschild. “It can be put this way. If I allow all things to vanish,
then according to Newton the Galilean inertial space remains; following
my interpretation, however, nothing remains.”5</p>
<p>The issue of inertia got Einstein into a debate with one of the great
astronomers of the time, Willem de Sitter of Leiden. Throughout 1916,
Einstein struggled to preserve the relativity of inertia and Mach’s
principle by using all sorts of constructs, including assuming various
“border conditions” such as distant masses along the fringes of space
that were, by necessity, unable to be observed. As de Sitter noted, that
in itself would have been anathema to Mach, who railed against
postulating things that could not possibly be observed.6</p>
<p>By February 1917, Einstein had come up with a new approach. “I have
completely abandoned my views, rightly contested by you,” he wrote de
Sitter. “I am curious to hear what you will have to say about the
somewhat crazy idea I am considering now.”7 It was an idea that
initially struck him as so wacky that he told his friend Paul Ehrenfest
in Leiden, “It exposes me to the danger of being confined to a
madhouse.” He jokingly asked Ehrenfest for assurances, before he came to
visit, that there were no such asylums in Leiden.8</p>
<p>His new idea was published that month in what became yet another
seminal Einstein paper, “Cosmological Considerations in the General
Theory of Relativity.”9 On the surface, it did indeed seem to be based
on a crazy notion: space has no borders because gravity bends it back on
itself.</p>
<p>Einstein began by noting that an absolutely infinite universe filled
with stars and other objects was not plausible. There would be an
infinite amount of gravity tugging at every point and an infinite amount
of light shining from every direction. On the other hand, a finite
universe floating at some random location in space was inconceivable as
well. Among other things, what would keep the stars and energy from
flying off, escaping, and depleting the universe?</p>
<p>So he developed a third option: a finite universe, but one without
boundaries. The masses in the universe caused space to curve, and over
the expanse of the universe they caused space (indeed, the whole
four-dimensional fabric of spacetime) to curve completely in on itself.
The system is closed and finite, but there is no end or edge to it.</p>
<p>One method that Einstein employed to help people visualize this
notion was to begin by imagining two-dimensional explorers on a
two-dimensional universe, like a flat surface. These “flatlanders” can
wander in any direction on this flat surface, but the concept of going
up or down has no meaning to them.</p>
<p>Now, imagine this variation: What if these flatlanders’ two
dimensions were still on a surface, but this surface was (in a way very
subtle to them) gently curved? What if they and their world were still
confined to two dimensions, but their flat surface was like the surface
of a globe? As Einstein put it, “Let us consider now a two-dimensional
existence, but this time on a spherical surface instead of on a plane.”
An arrow shot by these flatlanders would still seem to travel in a
straight line, but eventually it would curve around and come back—just
as a sailor on the surface of our planet heading straight off over the
seas would eventually return from the other horizon.</p>
<p>The curvature of the flatlanders’ two-dimensional space makes their
surface finite, and yet they can find no boundaries. No matter what
direction they travel, they reach no end or edge of their universe, but
they eventually get back to the same place. As Einstein put it, “The
great charm resulting from this consideration lies in the recognition
that the universe of these beings is finite and yet has no limits.” And
if the flatlanders’ surface was like that of an inflating balloon, their
whole universe could be expanding, yet there would still be no
boundaries to it.10</p>
<p>By extension, we can try to imagine, as Einstein has us do, how
three-dimensional space can be similarly curved to create a closed and
finite system that has no edge. It’s not easy for us three-dimensional
creatures to visualize, but it is easily described mathematically by the
non-Euclidean geometries pioneered by Gauss and Riemann. It can work for
four dimensions of spacetime as well.</p>
<p>In such a curved universe, a beam of light starting out in any
direction could travel what seems to be a straight line and yet still
curve back on itself. “This suggestion of a finite but unbounded space
is one of the greatest ideas about the nature of the world which has
ever been conceived,” the physicist Max Born has declared.11</p>
<p>Yes, but what is outside this curved universe? What’s on the other
side of the curve? That’s not merely an unanswerable question, it’s a
meaningless one, just as it would be meaningless for a flatlander to ask
what’s outside her surface. One could speculate, imaginatively or
mathematically, about what things are like in a fourth spatial
dimension, but other than in science fiction it is not very meaningful
to ask what’s in a realm that exists outside of the three spatial
dimensions of our curved universe.12</p>
<p>This concept of the cosmos that Einstein derived from his general
theory of relativity was elegant and magical. But there seemed to be one
hitch, a flaw that needed to be fixed or fudged. His theory indicated
that the universe would have to be either expanding or contracting, not
staying static. According to his field equations, a static universe was
impossible because the gravitational forces would pull all the matter
together.</p>
<p>This did not accord with what most astronomers thought they had
observed. As far as they knew, the universe consisted only of our Milky
Way galaxy, and it all seemed pretty stable and static. The stars
appeared to be meandering gently, but not receding rapidly as part of an
expanding universe. Other galaxies, such as Andromeda, were merely
unexplained blurs in the sky. (A few Americans working at the Lowell
Observatory in Arizona had noticed that the spectra of some mysterious
spiral nebulae were shifted to the red end of the spectrum, but
scientists had not yet determined that these were distant galaxies all
speeding away from our own.)</p>
<p>When the conventional wisdom of physics seemed to conflict with an
elegant theory of his, Einstein was inclined to question that wisdom
rather than his theory, often to have his stubbornness rewarded. In this
case, his gravitational field equations seemed to imply—indeed, screamed
out—that the conventional thinking about a stable universe was wrong and
should be tossed aside, just as Newton’s concept of absolute time
was.13</p>
<p>Instead, this time he made what he called a “slight modification” to
his theory. To keep the matter in the universe from imploding, Einstein
added a “repulsive” force: a little addition to his general relativity
equations to counterbalance gravity in the overall scheme.</p>
<p>In his revised equations, this modification was signified by the
Greek letter lambda, λ, which he used to multiply his metric tensor gμν
in a way that produced a stable, static universe. In his 1917 paper, he
was almost apologetic: “We admittedly had to introduce an extension of
the field equations that is not justified by our actual knowledge of
gravitation.”</p>
<p>He dubbed the new element the “cosmological term” or the
“cosmological constant” (kosmologische Glied was the phrase he used).
Later,* when it was discovered that the universe was in fact expanding,
Einstein would call it his “biggest blunder.” But even today, in light
of evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, it is
considered a useful concept, indeed a necessary one after all.14</p>
<p>During five months in 1905, Einstein had upended physics by
conceiving light quanta, special relativity, and statistical methods for
showing the existence of atoms. Now he had just completed a more
prolonged creative slog, from the fall of 1915 to the spring of 1917,
which Dennis Overbye has called “arguably the most prodigious effort of
sustained brilliance on the part of one man in the history of physics.”
His first burst of creativity as a patent clerk had appeared to involve
remarkably little anguish. But this later one was an arduous and intense
effort, one that left him exhausted and wracked with stomach
pains.15</p>
<p>During this period he generalized relativity, found the field
equations for gravity, found a physical explanation for light quanta,
hinted at how the quanta involved probability rather than certainty,†
and came up with a concept for the structure of the universe as a whole.
From the smallest thing conceivable, the quantum, to the largest, the
cosmos itself, Einstein had proven a master.</p>
<p>The Eclipse, 1919</p>
<p>For general relativity, there was a dramatic experimental test that
was possible, one that had the potential to dazzle and help heal a
war-weary world. It was based on a concept so simple that everyone could
understand it: gravity would bend light’s trajectory. Specifically,
Einstein predicted the degree to which light from a distant star would
be observed to curve as it went through the strong gravitational field
close to the sun.</p>
<p>To test this, astronomers would have to plot precisely the position
of a star in normal conditions. Then they would wait until the
alignments were such that the path of light from that star passed right
next to the sun. Did the star’s position seem to shift?</p>
<p>There was one exciting challenge. This observation required a total
eclipse, so that the stars would be visible and could be photographed.
Fortunately, nature happened to make the size of the sun and moon just
properly proportional so that every few years there are full eclipses
observable at times and places that make them ideally suited for such an
experiment.</p>
<p>Einstein’s 1911 paper, “On the Influence of Gravity on the
Propagation of Light,” and his Entwurf equations the following year, had
calculated that light would undergo a deflection of approximately
(allowing for some data corrections subsequently made) 0.85 arc-second
when it passed near the sun, which was the same as would be predicted by
an emission theory such as Newton’s that treated light as particles. As
previously noted, the attempt to test this during the August 1914
eclipse in the Crimea had been aborted by the war, so Einstein was saved
the potential embarrassment of being proved wrong.</p>
<p>Now, according to the field equations he formulated at the end of
1915, which accounted for the curvature of spacetime caused by gravity,
he had come up with twice that deflection. Light passing next to the sun
should be bent, he said, by about 1.7 arc-seconds.</p>
<p>In his 1916 popular book on relativity, Einstein issued yet another
call for scientists to test this conclusion. “Stars ought to appear to
be displaced outwards from the sun by 1.7 seconds of arc, as compared
with their apparent position in the sky when the sun is situated at
another part of the heavens,” he said.“The examination of the
correctness or otherwise of this deduction is a problem of the greatest
importance, the early solution of which is to be expected of
astronomers.”16</p>
<p>Willem de Sitter, the Dutch astrophysicist, had managed to send a
copy of Einstein’s general relativity paper across the English Channel
in 1916 in the midst of the war and get it to Arthur Eddington, who was
the director of the Cambridge Observatory. Einstein was not wellknown in
England, where scientists then took pride in either ignoring or
denigrating their German counterparts. Eddington became an exception. He
embraced relativity enthusiastically and wrote an account in English
that popularized the theory, at least among scholars.</p>
<p>Eddington consulted with the Astronomer Royal, Sir Frank Dyson, and
came up with the audacious idea that a team of English scientists should
prove the theory of a German, even as the two nations were at war. In
addition, it would help solve a personal problem for Eddington. He was a
Quaker and, because of his pacifist faith, faced imprisonment for
refusing military service in England. (In 1918, he was 35 years old,
still subject to conscription.) Dyson was able to convince the British
Admiralty that Eddington could best serve his nation by leading an
expedition to test the theory of relativity during the next full solar
eclipse.</p>
<p>That eclipse would occur on May 29, 1919, and Dyson pointed out that
it would be a unique opportunity. The sun would then be amid the rich
star cluster known as the Hyades, which we ordinary stargazers recognize
as the center of the constellation Taurus. But it would not be
convenient. The eclipse would be most visible in a path that stretched
across the Atlantic near the equator from the coast of Brazil to
Equatorial Africa. Nor would it be easy. As the expedition was being
considered in 1918, there were German U-boats in the region, and their
commanders were more interested in the control of the seas than in the
curvature of the cosmos.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the war ended before the expeditions began. In early
March 1919, Eddington sailed from Liverpool with two teams. One group
split off to set up their cameras in the isolated town of Sobral in the
Amazon jungle of northern Brazil. The second group, which included
Eddington, sailed for the tiny island of Principe, a Portuguese colony a
degree north of the equator just off the Atlantic coast of Africa.
Eddington set up his equipment on a 500-foot bluff on the island’s north
tip.17</p>
<p>The eclipse was due to begin just after 3:13 p.m. local time on
Principe and last about five minutes. That morning it rained heavily.
But as the time of the eclipse approached, the sky started to clear. The
heavens insisted on teasing and tantalizing Eddington at the most
important minutes of his career, with the remaining clouds cloaking and
then revealing the elusive sun.</p>
<p>“I did not see the eclipse, being too busy changing plates, except
for one glance to make sure it had begun and another halfway through to
see how much cloud there was,” Eddington noted in his diary. He took
sixteen photographs. “They are all good of the sun, showing a very
remarkable prominence; but the cloud has interfered with the star
images.” In his telegram back to London that day, he was more
telegraphic: “Through cloud, hopeful. Eddington.”18</p>
<p>The team in Brazil had better weather, but the final results had to
wait until all of the photographic plates from both places could be
shipped back to England, developed, measured, and compared. That took
until September, with Europe’s scientific cognoscenti waiting eagerly.
To some spectators, it took on the postwar political coloration of a
contest between the English theory of Newton, predicting about 0.85
arc-second deflection, and the German theory of Einstein, predicting a
1.7 arc-seconds deflection.</p>
<p>The photo finish did not produce an immediately clear result. One set
of particularly good pictures taken in Brazil showed a deflection of
1.98 arc-seconds. Another instrument, also at the Brazil location,
produced photographs that were a bit blurrier, because heat had affected
its mirror; they indicated a 0.86 deflection, but with a higher margin
of error. And then there were Eddington’s own plates from Principe.
These showed fewer stars, so a series of complex calculations were used
to extract some data. They seemed to indicate a deflection of about 1.6
arc-seconds.</p>
<p>The predictive power of Einstein’s theory—the fact that it offered up
a testable prediction—perhaps exercised a power over Eddington, whose
admiration for the mathematical elegance of the theory caused him to
believe in it deeply. He discarded the lower value coming out of Brazil,
contending that the equipment was faulty, and with a slight bias toward
his own fuzzy results from Africa got an average of just over 1.7
arc-seconds, matching Einstein’s predictions. It wasn’t the cleanest
confirmation, but it was enough for Eddington, and it turned out to be
valid. He later referred to getting these results as the greatest moment
of his life.19</p>
<p>In Berlin, Einstein put on an appearance of nonchalance, but he could
not completely hide his eagerness as he awaited word. The downward
spiral of the German economy in 1919 meant that the elevator in his
apartment building had been shut down, and he was preparing for a winter
with little heat. “Much shivering lies ahead for the winter,” he wrote
his ailing mother on September 5. “There is still no news about the
eclipse.” In a letter a week later to his friend Paul Ehrenfest in
Holland, Einstein ended with an affected casual question: “Have you by
any chance heard anything over there about the English solar-eclipse
observation?”20</p>
<p>Just by asking the question Einstein showed he was not quite as
sanguine as he tried to appear, because his friends in Holland would
certainly have already sent him such news if they had it. Finally they
did. On September 22, 1919, Lorentz sent a cable based on what he had
just heard from a fellow astronomer who had talked to Eddington at a
meeting: “Eddington found stellar shift at solar limb, tentative value
between nine-tenths of a second and twice that.” It was wonderfully
ambiguous. Was it a shift of 0.85 arc-second, as Newton’s emission
theory and Einstein’s discarded 1912 theory would have it? Or twice
that, as he now predicted?</p>
<p>Einstein had no doubts. “Today some happy news,” he wrote his mother.
“Lorentz telegraphed me that the British expeditions have verified the
deflection of light by the sun.”21 Perhaps his confidence was partly an
attempt to cheer up his mother, who was suffering from stomach cancer.
But it is more likely that it was because he knew his theory was
correct.</p>
<p>Einstein was with a graduate student, Ilse Schneider, shortly after
Lorentz’s news arrived. “He suddenly interrupted the discussion,” she
later recalled, and reached for the telegram that was lying on a window
sill. “Perhaps this will interest you,” he said, handing it to her.</p>
<p>Naturally she was overjoyed and excited, but Einstein was quite calm.
“I knew the theory was correct,” he told her.</p>
<p>But, she asked, what if the experiments had shown his theory to be
wrong?</p>
<p>He replied, “Then I would have been sorry for the dear Lord; the
theory is correct.”22</p>
<p>As more precise news of the eclipse results spread, Max Planck was
among those who gently noted to Einstein that it was good to have his
own confidence confirmed by some actual facts. “You have already said
many times that you never personally doubted what the result would be,”
Planck wrote, “but it is beneficial, nonetheless, if now this fact is
indubitably established for others as well.” For Einstein’s stolid
patron, the triumph had a transcendent aspect. “The intimate union
between the beautiful, the true and the real has again been proved.”
Einstein replied to Planck with a veneer of humility: “It is a gift from
gracious destiny that I have been allowed to experience this.”23</p>
<p>Einstein’s celebratory exchange with his closer friends in Zurich was
more lighthearted. The physics colloquium there sent him a piece of
doggerel:</p>
<p>All doubts have now been spent</p>
<p>At last it has been found:</p>
<p>Light is naturally bent</p>
<p>To Einstein’s great renown!24</p>
<p>To which Einstein replied a few days later, referring to the
eclipse:</p>
<p>Light and heat Mrs. Sun us tenders</p>
<p>Yet loves not he who broods and ponders.</p>
<p>So she contrives many a year</p>
<p>How she may hold her secret dear!</p>
<p>Now came the lunar visitor kind;</p>
<p>For joy, she almost forgot to shine.</p>
<p>Her deepest secrets too she lost</p>
<p>Eddington, you know, has snapped a shot.25</p>
<p>In defense of Einstein’s poetic prowess, it should be noted that his
verse works better in German, in which the last two lines end with
“gekommen” and “aufgenommen.”</p>
<p>The first unofficial announcement came at a meeting of the Dutch
Royal Academy. Einstein sat proudly onstage as Lorentz described
Eddington’s findings to an audience of close to a thousand cheering
students and scholars. But it was a closed meeting with no press, so the
leaks about the results merely added to the great public anticipation
leading up to the official announcement scheduled for two weeks later in
London.</p>
<p>The distinguished members of the Royal Society, Britain’s most
venerable scientific institution, met along with colleagues from the
Royal Astronomical Society on the afternoon of November 6, 1919, at
Burlington House in Piccadilly, for what they knew was likely to be a
historic event. There was only one item on the agenda: the report on the
eclipse observations.</p>
<p>Sir J. J. Thomson, the Royal Society’s president and discoverer of
the electron, was in the chair. Alfred North Whitehead, the philosopher,
had come down from Cambridge and was in the audience, taking notes.
Gazing down on them from an imposing portrait in the great hall was
Isaac Newton. “The whole atmosphere of tense interest was exactly that
of the Greek drama,” Whitehead recorded. “We were the chorus commenting
on the decree of destiny . . . and in the background the picture of
Newton to remind us that the greatest of scientific generalizations was,
now, after more than two centuries, to receive its first
modification.”26</p>
<p>The Astronomer Royal, Sir Frank Dyson, had the honor of presenting
the findings. He described in detail the equipment, the photographs, and
the complexities of the calculations. His conclusion, however, was
simple. “After a careful study of the plates, I am prepared to say that
there can be no doubt that they confirm Einstein’s prediction,” he
announced. “The results of the expeditions to Sobral and Principe leave
little doubt that a deflection of light takes place in the neighborhood
of the sun and that it is of the amount demanded by Einstein’s
generalized theory of relativity.”27</p>
<p>There was some skepticism in the room. “We owe it to that great man
to proceed very carefully in modifying or retouching his law of
gravitation,” cautioned Ludwig Silberstein, gesturing at Newton’s
portrait. But it was the commanding giant J. J. Thomson who set the
tone. “The result is one of the greatest achievements of human thought,”
he declared.28</p>
<p>Einstein was back in Berlin, so he missed the excitement. He
celebrated by buying a new violin. But he understood the historic impact
of the announcement that the laws of Sir Isaac Newton no longer fully
governed all aspects of the universe. “Newton, forgive me,” Einstein
later wrote, noting the moment. “You found the only way which, in your
age, was just about possible for a man of highest thought and creative
power.”29</p>
<p>It was a grand triumph, but not one easily understood. The skeptical
Silberstein came up to Eddington and said that people believed that only
three scientists in the world understood general relativity. He had been
told that Eddington was one of them.</p>
<p>The shy Quaker said nothing. “Don’t be so modest, Eddington!” said
Silberstein.</p>
<p>Replied Eddington, “On the contrary. I’m just wondering who the third
might be.”30</p>
