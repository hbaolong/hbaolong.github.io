ENTANGLEMENT</h4>
<p>1935</p>
<p>“Spooky Action at a Distance”</p>
<p>The thought experiments that Einstein had lobbed like grenades into
the temple of quantum mechanics had done little damage to the edifice.
In fact, they helped test it and permit a better understanding of its
implications. But Einstein remained a resister, and he continued to
conjure up new ways to show that the uncertainties inherent in the
interpretations formulated by Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born,
and others meant that something was missing in their explanation of
“reality.”</p>
<p>Just before he left Europe in 1933, Einstein attended a lecture by
Léon Rosenfeld, a Belgian physicist with a philosophical bent. When it
was over, Einstein rose from the audience to ask a question. “Suppose
two particles are set in motion towards each other with the same, very
large, momentum, and they interact with each other for a very short time
when they pass at known positions,” he posited. When the particles have
bounced far apart, an observer measures the momentum of one of them.
“Then, from the conditions of the experiment, he will obviously be able
to deduce the momentum of the other particle,” Einstein said. “If,
however, he chooses to measure the position of the first particle, he
will be able to tell where the other particle is.”</p>
<p>Because the two particles were far apart, Einstein was able to
assert, or at least to assume, that “all physical interaction has ceased
between them.” So his challenge to the Copenhagen interpreters of
quantum mechanics, posed as a question to Rosenfeld, was simple: “How
can the final state of the second particle be influenced by a
measurement performed on the first?”1</p>
<p>Over the years, Einstein had increasingly come to embrace the concept
of realism, the belief that there is, as he put it, “a real factual
situation” that exists “independent of our observations.”2 This belief
was one aspect of his discomfort with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
and other tenets of quantum mechanics that assert that observations
determine realities. With his question to Rosenfeld, Einstein was
deploying another concept: locality.* In other words, if two particles
are spatially distant from each other, anything that happens to one is
independent from what happens to the other, and no signal or force or
influence can move between them faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Observing or poking one particle, Einstein posited, could not
instantaneously jostle or jangle another one far away. The only way an
action on one system can affect a distant one is if some wave or signal
or information traveled between them—a process that would have to obey
the speed limit of light. That was even true of gravity. If the sun
suddenly disappeared, it would not affect the earth’s orbit for about
eight minutes, the amount of time it would take the change in the
gravitational field to ripple to the earth at the speed of light.</p>
<p>As Einstein said, “There is one supposition we should, in my opinion,
absolutely hold fast: the real factual situation of the system S2 is
independent of what is done with the system S1, which is spatially
separated from the former.”3 It was so intuitive that it seemed obvious.
But as Einstein noted, it was a “supposition.” It had never been
proven.</p>
<p>To Einstein, realism and localism were related underpinnings of
physics. As he declared to his friend Max Born, coining a memorable
phrase, “Physics should represent a reality in time and space, free from
spooky action at a distance.”4</p>
<p>Once he had settled in Princeton, Einstein began to refine this
thought experiment. His sidekick, Walther Mayer, less loyal to Einstein
than Einstein was to him, had drifted away from the front lines of
fighting quantum mechanics, so Einstein enlisted the help of Nathan
Rosen, a 26-year-old new fellow at the Institute, and Boris Podolsky, a
49-year-old physicist Einstein had met at Caltech who had since moved to
the Institute.</p>
<p>The resulting four-page paper, published in May 1935 and known by the
initials of its authors as the EPR paper, was the most important paper
Einstein would write after moving to America. “Can the
Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Regarded as
Complete?” they asked in their title.</p>
<p>Rosen did a lot of the math, and Podolsky wrote the published English
version. Even though they had discussed the content at length, Einstein
was displeased that Podolsky had buried the clear conceptual issue under
a lot of mathematical formalism. “It did not come out as well as I had
originally wanted,” Einstein complained to Schrödinger right after it
was published. “Rather, the essential thing was, so to speak, smothered
by the formalism.”5</p>
<p>Einstein was also annoyed at Podolsky for leaking the contents to the
New York Times before it was published. The headline read: “Einstein
Attacks Quantum Theory / Scientist and Two Colleagues Find It Not
‘Complete’ Even though ‘Correct.’” Einstein, of course, had occasionally
succumbed to giving interviews about upcoming articles, but this time he
declared himself dismayed by the practice. “It is my invariable practice
to discuss scientific matters only in the appropriate forum,” he wrote
in a statement to the Times, “and I deprecate advance publication of any
announcement in regard to such matters in the secular press.”6</p>
<p>Einstein and his two coauthors began by defining their realist
premise: “If without in any way disturbing a system we can predict with
certainty the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element
of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity.”7 In other
words, if by some process we could learn with absolute certainty the
position of a particle, and we have not disturbed the particle by
observing it, then we can say the particle’s position is real, that it
exists in reality totally independent of our observations.</p>
<p>The paper went on to expand Einstein’s thought experiment about two
particles that have collided (or have flown off in opposite directions
from the disintegration of an atom) and therefore have properties that
are correlated. We can take measurements of the first particle, the
authors asserted, and from that gain knowledge about the second particle
“without in any way disturbing the second particle.” By measuring the
position of the first particle, we can determine precisely the position
of the second particle. And we can do the same for the momentum. “In
accordance with our criterion for reality, in the first case we must
consider the quantity P as being an element of reality, in the second
case the quantity Q is an element of reality.”</p>
<p>In simpler words: at any moment the second particle, which we have
not observed, has a position that is real and a momentum that is real.
These two properties are features of reality that quantum mechanics does
not account for; thus the answer to the title’s question should be no,
quantum mechanics’ description of reality is not complete.8</p>
<p>The only alternative, the authors argued, would be to claim that the
process of measuring the first particle affects the reality of the
position and momentum of the second particle. “No reasonable definition
of reality could be expected to permit this,” they concluded.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Pauli wrote Heisenberg a long and angry letter.“Einstein has
once again expressed himself publicly on quantum mechanics (together
with Podolsky and Rosen—no good company, by the way),” he fumed. “As is
well known, every time that happens it is a catastrophe.”9</p>
<p>When the EPR paper reached Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, he realized that
he had once again been cast in the role, which he played so well at the
Solvay Conferences, of defending quantum mechanics from yet another
Einstein assault. “This onslaught came down on us as a bolt from the
blue,” a colleague of Bohr’s reported. “Its effect on Bohr was
remarkable.” He had often reacted to such situations by wandering around
and muttering, “Einstein . . . Einstein . . . Einstein!” This time he
added some collaborative doggerel as well: “Podolsky, Opodolsky,
Iopodolsky, Siopodolsky . . .”10</p>
<p>“Everything else was abandoned,” Bohr’s colleague recalled. “We had
to clear up such a misunderstanding at once.”Even with such intensity,
it took Bohr more than six weeks of fretting, writing, revising,
dictating, and talking aloud before he finally sent off his response to
EPR.</p>
<p>It was longer than the original paper. In it Bohr backed away
somewhat from what had been an aspect of the uncertainty principle: that
the mechanical disturbance caused by the act of observation was a cause
of the uncertainty. He admitted that in Einstein’s thought experiment,
“there is no question of a mechanical disturbance of the system under
investigation.”11</p>
<p>This was an important admission. Until then, the disturbance caused
by a measurement had been part of Bohr’s physical explanation of quantum
uncertainty. At the Solvay Conferences, he had rebutted Einstein’s
ingenious thought experiments by showing that the simultaneous knowledge
of, say, position and momentum was impossible at least in part because
determining one attribute caused a disturbance that made it impossible
to then measure the other attribute precisely.</p>
<p>However, using his concept of complementarity, Bohr added a
significant caveat. He pointed out that the two particles were part of
one whole phenomenon. Because they have interacted, the two particles
are therefore “entangled.” They are part of one whole phenomenon or one
whole system that has one quantum function.</p>
<p>In addition, the EPR paper did not, as Bohr noted, truly dispel the
uncertainty principle, which says that it is not possible to know both
the precise position and momentum of a particle at the same moment.
Einstein is correct, that if we measure the position of particle A, we
can indeed know the position of its distant twin B. Likewise, if we
measure the momentum of A, we can know the momentum of B. However, even
if we can imagine measuring the position and then the momentum of
particle A, and thus ascribe a “reality” to those attributes in particle
B, we cannot in fact measure both these attributes precisely at any one
time for particle A, and thus we cannot know them both precisely for
particle B. Brian Greene, discussing Bohr’s response, has put it simply:
“If you don’t have both of these attributes of the right-moving particle
in hand, you don’t have them for the left-moving particle either. Thus
there is no conflict with the uncertainty principle.”12</p>
<p>Einstein continued to insist, however, that he had pinpointed an
important example of the incompleteness of quantum mechanics by showing
how it violated the principle of separability, which holds that two
systems that are spatially separated have an independent existence. It
likewise violated the related principle of locality, which says that an
action on one of these systems cannot immediately affect the other. As
an adherent of field theory, which defines reality using a spacetime
continuum, Einstein believed that separability was a fundamental feature
of nature. And as a defender of his own theory of relativity, which rid
Newton’s cosmos of spooky action at a distance and decreed instead that
such actions obey the speed limit of light, he believed in locality as
well.13</p>
<p>Schrödinger’s Cat</p>
<p>Despite his success as a quantum pioneer, Erwin Schrödinger was among
those rooting for Einstein to succeed in deflating the Copenhagen
consensus. Their alliance had been forged at the Solvay Conferences,
where Einstein played God’s advocate and Schrödinger looked on with a
mix of curiosity and sympathy. It was a lonely struggle, Einstein
lamented in a letter to Schrödinger in 1928: “The Heisenberg-Bohr
tranquilizing philosophy—or religion?—is so delicately contrived that,
for the time being, it provides a gentle pillow for the true believer
from which he cannot very easily be aroused.”14</p>
<p>So it was not surprising that Schrödinger sent Einstein a
congratulatory note as soon as he read the EPR paper. “You have publicly
caught dogmatic quantum mechanics by its throat,” he wrote. A few weeks
later, he added happily, “Like a pike in a goldfish pond it has stirred
everyone up.”15</p>
<p>Schrödinger had just visited Princeton, and Einstein was still
hoping, in vain, that Flexner might be convinced to hire him for the
Institute. In his subsequent flurry of exchanges with Schrödinger,
Einstein began conspiring with him on ways to poke holes in quantum
mechanics.</p>
<p>“I do not believe in it,” Einstein declared flatly. He ridiculed as
“spiritualistic” the notion that there could be “spooky action at a
distance,” and he attacked the idea that there was no reality beyond our
ability to observe things. “This epistemology-soaked orgy ought to burn
itself out,” he said. “No doubt, however, you smile at me and think
that, after all, many a young whore turns into an old praying sister,
and many a young revolutionary becomes an old reactionary.”16
Schrödinger did smile, he told Einstein in his reply, because he had
likewise edged from revolutionary to old reactionary.</p>
<p>On one issue Einstein and Schrödinger diverged. Schrödinger did not
feel that the concept of locality was sacred. He even coined the term
that we now use, entanglement, to describe the correlations that exist
between two particles that have interacted but are now distant from each
other. The quantum states of two particles that have interacted must
subsequently be described together, with any changes to one particle
instantly being reflected in the other, no matter how far apart they now
are. “Entanglement of predictions arises from the fact that the two
bodies at some earlier time formed in a true sense one system, that is
were interacting, and have left behind traces on each other,”
Schrödinger wrote. “If two separated bodies enter a situation in which
they influence each other, and separate again, then there occurs what I
have just called entanglement of our knowledge of the two bodies.”17</p>
<p>Einstein and Schrödinger together began exploring another way—one
that did not hinge on issues of locality or separation—to raise
questions about quantum mechanics. Their new approach was to look at
what would occur when an event in the quantum realm, which includes
subatomic particles, interacted with objects in the macro world, which
includes those things we normally see in our daily lives.</p>
<p>In the quantum realm, there is no definite location of a particle,
such as an electron, at any given moment. Instead, a mathematical
function, known as a wave function, describes the probability of finding
the particle in some particular place. These wave functions also
describe quantum states, such as the probability that an atom will, when
observed, be decayed or not. In 1925, Schrödinger had come up with his
famous equation that described these waves, which spread and smear
throughout space. His equation defined the probability that a particle,
when observed, will be found in a particular place or state.18</p>
<p>According to the Copenhagen interpretation developed by Niels Bohr
and his fellow pioneers of quantum mechanics, until such an observation
is made, the reality of the particle’s position or state consists only
of these probabilities. By measuring or observing the system, the
observer causes the wave function to collapse and one distinct position
or state to snap into place.</p>
<p>In a letter to Schrödinger, Einstein gave a vivid thought experiment
showing why all this discussion of wave functions and probabilities, and
of particles that have no definite positions until observed, failed his
test of completeness. He imagined two boxes, one of which we know
contains a ball. As we prepare to look in one of the boxes, there is a
50 percent chance of the ball being there. After we look, there is
either a 100 percent or a 0 percent chance it is in there. But all
along, in reality, the ball was in one of the boxes. Einstein wrote:</p>
<p>I describe a state of affairs as follows: the probability is ½ that
the ball is in the first box. Is that a complete description? no: A
complete statement is: the ball is (or is not) in the first box. That is
how the characterization of the state of affairs must appear in a
complete description. yes: Before I open them, the ball is by no means
in one of the two boxes. Being in a definite box comes about only when I
lift the covers.19</p>
<p>Einstein clearly preferred the former explanation, a statement of his
realism. He felt that there was something incomplete about the second
answer, which was the way quantum mechanics explained things.</p>
<p>Einstein’s argument is based on what appears to be common sense.
However, sometimes what seems to make sense turns out not to be a good
description of nature. Einstein realized this when he developed his
relativity theory; he defied the accepted common sense of the time and
forced us to change the way we think about nature. Quantum mechanics
does something similar. It asserts that particles do not have a definite
state except when observed, and two particles can be in an entangled
state so that the observation of one determines a property of the other
instantly. As soon as any observation is made, the system goes into a
fixed state.20</p>
<p>Einstein never accepted this as a complete description of reality,
and along these lines he proposed another thought experiment to
Schrödinger a few weeks later, in early August 1935. It involved a
situation in which quantum mechanics would assign only probabilities,
even though common sense tells us that there is obviously an underlying
reality that exists with certainty. Imagine a pile of gunpowder that,
due to the instability of some particle, will combust at some point,
Einstein said. The quantum mechanical equation for this situation
“describes a sort of blend of not-yet and already-exploded systems.” But
this is not “a real state of affairs,” Einstein said, “for in reality
there is just no intermediary between exploded and not-exploded.”21</p>
<p>Schrödinger came up with a similar thought experiment—involving a
soon-to-be-famous fictional feline rather than a pile of gunpowder—to
show the weirdness inherent when the indeterminacy of the quantum realm
interacts with our normal world of larger objects. “In a lengthy essay
that I have just written, I give an example that is very similar to your
exploding powder keg,” he told Einstein.22</p>
<p>In this essay, published that November, Schrödinger gave generous
credit to Einstein and the EPR paper for “providing the impetus” for his
argument. It poked at a core concept in quantum mechanics, namely that
the timing of the emission of a particle from a decaying nucleus is
indeterminate until it is actually observed. In the quantum world, a
nucleus is in a “superposition,” meaning it exists simultaneously as
being decayed and undecayed until it is observed, at which point its
wave function collapses and it becomes either one or the other.</p>
<p>This may be conceivable for the microscopic quantum realm, but it is
baffling when one imagines the intersection between the quantum realm
and our observable everyday world. So, Schrödinger asked in his thought
experiment, when does the system stop being in a superposition
incorporating both states and snap into being one reality?</p>
<p>This question led to the precarious fate of an imaginary creature,
which was destined to become immortal whether it was dead or alive,
known as Schrödinger’s cat:</p>
<p>One can even set up quite ridiculous cases. A cat is penned up in a
steel chamber, along with the following device (which must be secured
against direct interference by the cat): in a Geiger counter there is a
tiny bit of radioactive substance, so small, that perhaps in the course
of the hour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability,
perhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a
relay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic
acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one
would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed. The
psi-function of the entire system would express this by having in it the
living and dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out.23</p>
<p>Einstein was thrilled. “Your cat shows that we are in complete
agreement concerning our assessment of the character of the current
theory,” he wrote back. “A psi-function that contains the living as well
as the dead cat just cannot be taken as a description of a real state of
affairs.”24</p>
<p>The case of Schrödinger’s cat has spawned reams of responses that
continue to pour forth with varying degrees of comprehensibility.
Suffice it to say that in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
mechanics, a system stops being a superposition of states and snaps into
a single reality when it is observed, but there is no clear rule for
what constitutes such an observation. Can the cat be an observer? A
flea? A computer? A mechanical recording device? There’s no set answer.
However, we do know that quantum effects generally are not observed in
our everyday visible world, which includes cats and even fleas. So most
adherents of quantum mechanics would not argue that Schrödinger’s cat is
sitting in that box somehow being both dead and alive until the lid is
opened.25</p>
<p>Einstein never lost faith in the ability of Schrödinger’s cat and his
own gunpowder thought experiments of 1935 to expose the incompleteness
of quantum mechanics. Nor has he received proper historical credit for
helping give birth to that poor cat. In fact, he would later mistakenly
give Schrödinger credit for both of the thought experiments in a letter
that exposed the animal to being blown up rather than poisoned.
“Contemporary physicists somehow believe that the quantum theory
provides a description of reality, and even a complete description,”
Einstein wrote Schrödinger in 1950.“This interpretation is, however,
refuted most elegantly by your system of radioactive atom + Geiger
counter + amplifier + charge of gunpowder + cat in a box, in which the
psi-function of the system contains the cat both alive and blown to
bits.”26</p>
<p>Einstein’s so-called mistakes, such as the cosmological constant he
added to his gravitational field equations, often turned out to be more
intriguing than other people’s successes. The same was true of his
parries against Bohr and Heisenberg. The EPR paper would not succeed in
showing that quantum mechanics was wrong. But it did eventually become
clear that quantum mechanics was, as Einstein argued, incompatible with
our commonsense understanding of locality—our aversion to spooky action
at a distance. The odd thing is that Einstein, apparently, was far more
right than he hoped to be.</p>
<p>In the years since he came up with the EPR thought experiment, the
idea of entanglement and spooky action at a distance—the quantum
weirdness in which an observation of one particle can instantly affect
another one far away—has increasingly become part of what experimental
physicists study. In 1951, David Bohm, a brilliant assistant professor
at Princeton, recast the EPR thought experiment so that it involved the
opposite “spins” of two particles flying apart from an interaction.27 In
1964, John Stewart Bell, who worked at the CERN nuclear research
facility near Geneva, wrote a paper that proposed a way to conduct
experiments based on this approach.28</p>
<p>Bell was less than comfortable with quantum mechanics. “I hesitated
to think it was wrong,” he once said, “but I knew that it was rotten.”29
That, plus his admiration of Einstein, caused him to express some hope
that Einstein rather than Bohr might be proven right. But when the
experiments were undertaken in the 1980s by the French physicist Alain
Aspect and others, they provided evidence that locality was not a
feature of the quantum world. “Spooky action at a distance,” or, more
precisely, the potential entanglement of distant particles, was.30</p>
<p>Even so, Bell ended up appreciating Einstein’s efforts. “I felt that
Einstein’s intellectual superiority over Bohr, in this instance, was
enormous, a vast gulf between the man who saw clearly what was needed,
and the obscurantist,” he said. “So for me, it is a pity that Einstein’s
idea doesn’t work. The reasonable thing just doesn’t work.”31</p>
<p>Quantum entanglement—an idea discussed by Einstein in 1935 as a way
of undermining quantum mechanics—is now one of the weirder elements of
physics, because it is so counterintuitive. Every year the evidence for
it mounts, and public fascination with it grows. At the end of 2005, for
example, the New York Times published a survey article called “Quantum
Trickery: Testing Einstein’s Strangest Theory,” by Dennis Overbye, in
which Cornell physicist N. David Mermin called it “the closest thing we
have to magic.”32 And in 2006, the New Scientist ran a story titled
“Einstein’s ‘Spooky Action’ Seen on a Chip,” which began:</p>
<p>A simple semiconductor chip has been used to generate pairs of
entangled photons, a vital step towards making quantum computers a
reality. Famously dubbed “spooky action at a distance” by Einstein,
entanglement is the mysterious phenomenon of quantum particles whereby
two particles such as photons behave as one regardless of how far apart
they are.33</p>
<p>Might this spooky action at a distance—where something that happens
to a particle in one place can be instantly reflected by one that is
billions of miles away—violate the speed limit of light? No, the theory
of relativity still seems safe. The two particles, though distant,
remain part of the same physical entity. By observing one of them, we
may affect its attributes, and that is correlated to what would be
observed of the second particle. But no information is transmitted, no
signal sent, and there is no traditional cause-and-effect relationship.
One can show by thought experiments that quantum entanglement cannot be
used to send information instantaneously. “In short,” says physicist
Brian Greene, “special relativity survives by the skin of its
teeth.”34</p>
<p>During the past few decades, a number of theorists, including Murray
Gell-Mann and James Hartle, have adopted a view of quantum mechanics
that differs in some ways from the Copenhagen interpretation and
provides an easier explanation of the EPR thought experiment. Their
interpretation is based on alternative histories of the universe,
coarse-grained in the sense that they follow only certain variables and
ignore (or average over) the rest. These “decoherent” histories form a
tree-like structure, with each of the alternatives at one time branching
out into alternatives at the next time and so forth.</p>
<p>In the case of the EPR thought experiment, the position of one of the
two particles is measured on one branch of history. Because of the
common origin of the particles, the position of the other one is
determined as well. On a different branch of history, the momentum of
one of the particles may be measured, and the momentum of the other one
is also determined. On each branch nothing occurs that violates the laws
of classical physics. The information about one particle implies the
corresponding information about the other one, but nothing happens to
the second particle as a result of the measurement of the first one. So
there is no threat to special relativity and its prohibition of
instantaneous transmission of information. What is special about quantum
mechanics is that the simultaneous determination of the position and the
momentum of a particle is impossible, so if these two determinations
occur, it must be on different branches of history.35</p>
<p>“Physics and Reality”</p>
<p>Einstein’s fundamental dispute with the Bohr-Heisenberg crowd over
quantum mechanics was not merely about whether God rolled dice or left
cats half dead. Nor was it just about causality, locality, or even
completeness. It was about reality.36 Does it exist? More specifically,
is it meaningful to speak about a physical reality that exists
independently of whatever observations we can make? “At the heart of the
problem,” Einstein said of quantum mechanics, “is not so much the
question of causality but the question of realism.”37</p>
<p>Bohr and his adherents scoffed at the idea that it made sense to talk
about what might be beneath the veil of what we can observe. All we can
know are the results of our experiments and observations, not some
ultimate reality that lies beyond our perceptions.</p>
<p>Einstein had displayed some elements of this attitude in 1905, back
when he was reading Hume and Mach while rejecting such unobservable
concepts as absolute space and time. “At that time my mode of thinking
was much nearer positivism than it was later on,” he recalled. “My
departure from positivism came only when I worked out the general theory
of relativity.”38</p>
<p>From then on, Einstein increasingly adhered to the belief that there
is an objective classical reality. And though there are some
consistencies between his early and late thinking, he admitted freely
that, at least in his own mind, his realism represented a move away from
his earlier Machian empiricism. “This credo,” he said, “does not
correspond with the point of view I held in younger years.”39 As the
historian Gerald Holton notes, “For a scientist to change his
philosophical beliefs so fundamentally is rare.”40</p>
<p>Einstein’s concept of realism had three main components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>His belief that a reality exists independent of our ability to
observe it. As he put it in his autobiographical notes: “Physics is an
attempt conceptually to grasp reality as it is thought independently of
its being observed. In this sense one speaks of ‘physical
reality.’”41</p></li>
<li><p>His belief in separability and locality. In other words, objects
are located at certain points in spacetime, and this separability is
part of what defines them. “If one abandons the assumption that what
exists in different parts of space has its own independent, real
existence, then I simply cannot see what it is that physics is supposed
to describe,” he declared to Max Born.42</p></li>
<li><p>His belief in strict causality, which implies certainty and
classical determinism. The idea that probabilities play a role in
reality was as disconcerting to him as the idea that our observations
might play a role in collapsing those probabilities. “Some physicists,
among them myself, cannot believe,” he said, “that we must accept the
view that events in nature are analogous to a game of
chance.”43</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is possible to imagine a realism that has only two, or even just
one, of these three attributes, and on occasion Einstein pondered such a
possibility. Scholars have debated which of these three was most
fundamental to his thinking.44 But Einstein kept coming back to the
hope, and faith, that all three attributes go together. As he said in a
speech to a doctors convention in Cleveland near the end of his life,
“Everything should lead back to conceptual objects in the realm of space
and time and to lawlike relations that obtain for these objects.”45</p>
<p>At the heart of this realism was an almost religious, or perhaps
childlike, awe at the way all of our sense perceptions—the random sights
and sounds that we experience every minute—fit into patterns, follow
rules, and make sense. We take it for granted when these perceptions
piece together to represent what seem to be external objects, and it
does not amaze us when laws seem to govern the behavior of these
objects.</p>
<p>But just as he felt awe when first pondering a compass as a child,
Einstein was able to feel awe that there are rules ordering our
perceptions, rather than pure randomness. Reverence for this astonishing
and unexpected comprehensibility of the universe was the foundation for
his realism as well as the defining character of what he called his
religious faith.</p>
<p>He expressed this in a 1936 essay, “Physics and Reality,” written on
the heels of his defense of realism in the debates over quantum
mechanics. “The very fact that the totality of our sense experiences is
such that, by means of thinking, it can be put in order, this fact is
one that leaves us in awe,” he wrote. “The eternal mystery of the world
is its comprehensibility . . . The fact that it is comprehensible is a
miracle.”46</p>
<p>His friend Maurice Solovine, with whom he had read Hume and Mach in
the days of the Olympia Academy, told Einstein that he found it
“strange” that he considered the comprehensibility of the world to be “a
miracle or an eternal mystery.” Einstein countered that it would be
logical to assume that the opposite was the case. “Well, a priori, one
should expect a chaotic world which cannot be grasped by the mind in any
way,” he wrote. “There lies the weakness of positivists and professional
atheists.”47 Einstein was neither.</p>
<p>To Einstein, this belief in the existence of an underlying reality
had a religious aura to it. That dismayed Solovine, who wrote to say
that he had an “aversion” to such language. Einstein disagreed. “I have
no better expression than ‘religious’ for this confidence in the
rational nature of reality and in its being accessible, to some degree,
to human reason. When this feeling is missing, science degenerates into
mindless empiricism.”48</p>
<p>Einstein knew that the new generation viewed him as an out-of-touch
conservative clinging to the old certainties of classical physics, and
that amused him. “Even the great initial success of the quantum theory
does not make me believe in a fundamental dice-game,” he told his friend
Max Born, “although I am well aware that our younger colleagues
interpret this as a consequence of senility.”49</p>
<p>Born, who loved Einstein dearly, agreed with the Young Turks that
Einstein had become as “conservative” as the physicists of a generation
earlier who had balked at his relativity theory. “He could no longer
take in certain new ideas in physics which contradicted his own firmly
held philosophical convictions.”50</p>
<p>But Einstein preferred to think of himself not as a conservative but
as (again) a rebel, a nonconformist, one with the curiosity and
stubbornness to buck prevailing fads. “The necessity of conceiving of
nature as an objective reality is said to be obsolete prejudice while
the quantum theoreticians are vaunted,” he told Solovine in 1938. “Each
period is dominated by a mood, with the result that most men fail to see
the tyrant who rules over them.”51</p>
<p>Einstein pushed his realist approach in a textbook on the history of
physics that he coauthored in 1938, The Evolution of Physics. Belief in
an “objective reality,” the book argued, had led to great scientific
advances throughout the ages, thus proving that it was a useful concept
even if not provable. “Without the belief that it is possible to grasp
reality with our theoretical constructions, without the belief in the
inner harmony of our world, there could be no science,” the book
declared. “This belief is and always will remain the fundamental motive
for all scientific creation.”52</p>
<p>In addition, Einstein used the text to defend the utility of field
theories amid the advances of quantum mechanics. The best way to do that
was to view particles not as independent objects but as a special
manifestation of the field itself:</p>
<p>There is no sense in regarding matter and field as two qualities
quite different from each other … Could we not reject the concept of
matter and build a pure field physics? We could regard matter as the
regions in space where the field is extremely strong. A thrown stone is,
from this point of view, a changing field in which the states of the
greatest field intensity travel through space with the velocity of the
stone.53</p>
<p>There was a third reason that Einstein helped to write this textbook,
a more personal one. He wanted to help Leopold Infeld, a Jew who had
fled Poland, collaborated briefly in Cambridge with Max Born, and then
moved to Princeton.54 Infeld began working on relativity with Banesh
Hoffmann, and he proposed that they offer themselves to Einstein. “Let’s
see if he’d like us to work with him,” Infeld suggested.</p>
<p>Einstein was delighted. “We did all the dirty work of calculating the
equations and so on,” Hoffmann recalled. “We reported the results to
Einstein and then it was like having a headquarters conference.
Sometimes his ideas seemed to come from left field, to be quite
extraordinary.”55 Working with Infeld and Hoffmann, Einstein in 1937
came up with elegant ways to explain more simply the motion of planets
and other massive objects that produced their own curvatures of
space.</p>
<p>But their work on unified field theory never quite gelled. At times,
the situation seemed so hopeless that Infeld and Hoffmann became
despondent. “But Einstein’s courage never faltered, nor did his
inventiveness fail him,” Hoffmann recalled. “When excited discussion
failed to break the deadlock, Einstein would quietly say in his quaint
English, ‘I will a little tink.’” The room would become silent, and
Einstein would pace slowly up and down or walk around in circles,
twirling a lock of his hair around his forefinger. “There was a dreamy,
far-away, yet inward look on his face. No sign of stress. No outward
indication of intense concentration.” After a few minutes, he would
suddenly return to the world, “a smile on his face and an answer to the
problem on his lips.”56</p>
<p>Einstein was so pleased with Infeld’s help that he tried to get
Flexner to give him a post at the Institute. But Flexner, who was
annoyed that the Institute had already been forced to hire Walther
Mayer, balked. Einstein even went to a fellows meeting in person, which
he rarely did, to argue for a mere 00 stipend for Infeld, but to no
avail.57</p>
<p>So Infeld came up with a plan to write a history of physics with
Einstein, which was sure to be successful, and split the royalties. When
he went to Einstein to pitch the idea, Infeld became incredibly
tongue-tied, but he was finally able to stammer out his proposal. “This
is not at all a stupid idea,” Einstein said. “Not stupid at all. We
shall do it.”58</p>
<p>In April 1937, Richard Simon and Max Schuster, founders of the house
that published this biography, drove out to Einstein’s home in Princeton
to secure the rights. The gregarious Schuster tried to win Einstein over
with jokes. He had discovered something faster than the speed of light,
he said: “The speed with which a woman arriving in Paris goes
shopping.”59 Einstein was amused, or at least so Schuster recalled. In
any event, the trip was successful, and the Evolution of Physics, which
is in its forty-fourth printing, not only propagandized for the role of
field theories and a faith in objective reality, it also made Infeld
(and Einstein) more secure financially.</p>
<p>No one could accuse Infeld of being ungrateful. He later called
Einstein “perhaps the greatest scientist and kindest man who ever
lived.” He also wrote a flattering biography of Einstein, while his
mentor was still alive, that praised him for his willingness to defy
conventional thinking in his quest for a unified theory. “His tenacity
in sticking to a problem for years, in returning to the problem again
and again—this is the characteristic feature of Einstein’s genius,” he
wrote.60</p>
<p>Against the Current</p>
<p>Was Infeld right? Was tenacity the characteristic feature of
Einstein’s genius? To some extent he had always been blessed by this
trait, especially in his long and lonely quest to generalize relativity.
There was also ingrained in him, since his school days, a willingness to
sail against the current and defy the reigning authorities. All of this
was evident in his quest for a unified theory.</p>
<p>But even though he liked to claim that an analysis of empirical data
had played a minimal role in the construction of his great theories, he
had generally been graced with an intuitive feel for the insights and
principles that could be wrested from nature based on current
experiments and observations. This trait was now becoming less
evident.</p>
<p>By the late 1930s, he was becoming increasingly detached from new
experimental discoveries. Instead of the unification of gravity and
electromagnetism, there was greater disunity as two new forces, the weak
and the strong nuclear forces, were found. “Einstein chose to ignore
those new forces, although they were not any less fundamental than the
two which have been known about longer,” his friend Abraham Pais
recalled. “He continued the old search for a unification of gravitation
and electromagnetism.”61</p>
<p>In addition, a menagerie of new fundamental particles were discovered
beginning in the 1930s. Currently there are dozens of them, ranging from
bosons such as photons and gluons to fermions such as electrons,
positrons, up quarks, and down quarks. This did not seem to bode well
for Einstein’s quest to unify everything. His friend Wolfgang Pauli, who
joined him at the Institute in 1940, quipped about the futility of this
quest. “What God has put asunder,” he said, “let no man join
together.”62</p>
<p>Einstein found the new discoveries to be vaguely disconcerting, but
he felt comfortable not putting much emphasis on them. “I can derive
only small pleasure from the great discoveries, because for the time
being they do not seem to facilitate for me an understanding of the
foundations,” he wrote Max von Laue. “I feel like a kid who cannot get
the hang of the ABCs, even though, strangely enough, I do not abandon
hope. After all, one is dealing here with a sphinx, not with a willing
streetwalker.”63</p>
<p>So Einstein beat on against the current, borne back ceaselessly into
the past. He realized that he had the luxury to pursue his lonely
course, something that would be too risky for younger physicists still
trying to make their reputations.64 But as it turned out, there were
usually at least two or three younger physicists, attracted by
Einstein’s aura, willing to collaborate with him, even if the vast
majority of the physics priest-hood considered his search for a unified
field theory to be quixotic.</p>
<p>One of these young assistants, Ernst Straus, remembers working on an
approach that Einstein pursued for almost two years. One evening, Straus
found, to his dismay, that their equations led to some conclusions that
clearly could not be true. The next day, he and Einstein explored the
issue from all angles, but they could not avoid the disappointing
result. So they went home early. Straus was dejected, and he assumed
that Einstein would be even more so. To his surprise, Einstein was as
eager and excited as ever the next day, and he proposed yet another
approach they could take. “This was the start of an entirely new theory,
also relegated to the trash heap after a half-year’s work and mourned no
longer than its predecessor,” Straus recalls.65</p>
<p>Einstein’s quest was driven by his intuition that mathematical
simplicity, an attribute he never fully defined though he felt he knew
it when he saw it, was a feature of nature’s handiwork.66 Every now and
then, when a particularly elegant formulation cropped up, he would exult
to Straus, “This is so simple God could not have passed it up.”</p>
<p>Enthusiastic letters to friends continued to pour forth from
Princeton about the progress of his crusade against the quantum
theorists who seemed wedded to probabilities and averse to believing in
an underlying reality. “I am working with my young people on an
extremely interesting theory with which I hope to defeat modern
proponents of mysticism and probability and their aversion to the notion
of reality in the domain of physics,” he wrote Maurice Solovine in
1938.67</p>
<p>Likewise, headlines continued to emanate from Princeton on purported
breakthroughs. “Soaring over a hitherto unscaled mathematical
mountain-top, Dr. Albert Einstein, climber of cosmic Alps, reports
having sighted a new pattern in the structure of space and matter,” the
distinguished New York Times science reporter William Laurence reported
in a page 1 article in 1935. The same writer and the same paper reported
on page 1 in 1939, “Albert Einstein revealed today that after twenty
years of unremitting search for a law that would explain the mechanism
of the cosmos in its entirety, reaching out from the stars and galaxies
in the vastness of infinite space down to the mysteries within the heart
of the infinitesimal atom, he has at last arrived within sight of what
he hopes may be the ‘Promised Land of Knowledge,’ holding what may be
the master key to the riddle of creation.”68</p>
<p>The triumphs in his salad days had come partly from having an
instinct that could sniff out underlying physical realities. He could
intuitively sense the implications of the relativity of all motion, the
constancy of the speed of light, and the equivalence of gravitational
and inertial mass. From that he could build theories based on a feel for
the physics. But he later became more reliant on a mathematical
formalism, because it had guided him in his final sprint to complete the
field equations of general relativity.</p>
<p>Now, in his quest for a unified theory, there seemed to be a lot of
mathematical formalism but very few fundamental physical insights
guiding him. “In his earlier search for the general theory, Einstein had
been guided by his principle of equivalence linking gravitation with
acceleration,” said Banesh Hoffmann, a Princeton collaborator. “Where
were the comparable guiding principles that could lead to the
construction of a unified field theory? No one knew. Not even Einstein.
Thus the search was not so much a search as a groping in the gloom of a
mathematical jungle inadequately lit by physical intuition.” Jeremy
Bernstein later called it “like an all but random shuffling of
mathematical formulas with no physics in view.”69</p>
<p>After a while, the optimistic headlines and letters stopped emanating
from Princeton, and Einstein publicly admitted that he was, at least for
the time being, stymied. “I am not as optimistic,” he told the New York
Times. For years the paper had regularly headlined each of Einstein’s
purported breakthroughs toward a unified theory, but now its headline
read, “Einstein Baffled by Cosmos Riddle.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Einstein insisted that he still could not “accept the
view that events in nature are analogous to a game of chance.” And so he
pledged to continue his quest. Even if he failed, he felt that the
effort would be meaningful. “It is open to every man to choose the
direction of his striving,” he explained, “and every man may take
comfort from the fine saying that the search for truth is more precious
than its possession.”70</p>
<p>Around the time of Einstein’s sixtieth birthday, early in the spring
of 1939, Niels Bohr came to Princeton for a two-month visit. Einstein
remained somewhat aloof toward his old friend and sparring partner. They
met at a few receptions, exchanged some small talk, but did not reengage
in their old game of volleying thought experiments about quantum
weirdness.</p>
<p>Einstein gave only one lecture during that period, which Bohr
attended. It dealt with his latest attempts to find a unified field
theory. At the end, Einstein fixed his eyes on Bohr and noted that he
had long tried to explain quantum mechanics in such a fashion. But he
made clear that he would prefer not to discuss the issue further. “Bohr
was profoundly unhappy with this,” his assistant recalled.71</p>
<p>Bohr had arrived in Princeton with a piece of scientific news that
was related to Einstein’s discovery of the link between energy and mass,
E=mc2. In Berlin, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman had gotten some
interesting experimental results by bombarding heavy uranium with
neutrons. These had been sent to their former colleague, Lise Meitner,
who had just been forced to flee to Sweden because she was half Jewish.
She in turn shared them with her nephew Otto Frisch, and they concluded
that the atom had been split, two lighter nuclei created, and a small
amount of lost mass turned into energy.</p>
<p>After they substantiated the results, which they dubbed fission,
Frisch informed his colleague Bohr, who was about to leave for America.
Upon his arrival in late January 1939, Bohr described the new discovery
to colleagues, and it was discussed at a weekly gathering of physicists
in Princeton known as the Monday Evening Club. Within days the results
had been replicated, and researchers began churning out papers on the
process, including one that Bohr wrote with a young untenured physics
professor, John Archibald Wheeler.</p>
<p>Einstein had long been skeptical about the possibility of harnessing
atomic energy or unleashing the power implied by E=mc2. On a visit to
Pittsburgh in 1934, he had been asked the question and replied that
“splitting the atom by bombardment is something akin to shooting birds
in the dark in a place where there are only a few birds.” That produced
a banner headline across the front page of the Post-Gazette:“Atom Energy
Hope Is Spiked by Einstein / Efforts at Loosing Vast Force Is Called
Fruitless / Savant Talked Here.”72</p>
<p>With the news in early 1939 that it was, apparently, very possible to
bombard and split an atomic nucleus, Einstein faced the question again.
In an interview for his sixtieth birthday that March, he was asked
whether mankind would find some use for the process. “Our results so far
concerning the splitting of the atom do not justify the assumption of a
practical utilization of the energies released,” he replied. This time
he was cautious, however, and went on to hedge his answer slightly.
“There is no physicist with soul so poor who would allow this to affect
his interest in this highly important subject.”73</p>
<p>Over the next four months, his interest would indeed grow
rapidly.</p>
