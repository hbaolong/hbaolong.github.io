<h4 id="chapter-two-childhood">CHAPTER TWO CHILDHOOD</h4>
<p>1879–1896</p>
<p>Maja, age 3, and Albert Einstein, 5</p>
<p>The Swabian</p>
<p>He was slow in learning how to talk. “My parents were so worried,” he
later recalled, “that they consulted a doctor.” Even after he had begun
using words, sometime after the age of 2, he developed a quirk that
prompted the family maid to dub him “der Depperte,” the dopey one, and
others in his family to label him as “almost backwards.” Whenever he had
something to say, he would try it out on himself, whispering it softly
until it sounded good enough to pronounce aloud. “Every sentence he
uttered,” his worshipful younger sister recalled, “no matter how
routine, he repeated to himself softly, moving his lips.” It was all
very worrying, she said. “He had such difficulty with language that
those around him feared he would never learn.”1</p>
<p>His slow development was combined with a cheeky rebelliousness toward
authority, which led one schoolmaster to send him packing and another to
amuse history by declaring that he would never amount to much. These
traits made Albert Einstein the patron saint of distracted school kids
everywhere.2 But they also helped to make him, or so he later surmised,
the most creative scientific genius of modern times.</p>
<p>His cocky contempt for authority led him to question received wisdom
in ways that well-trained acolytes in the academy never contemplated.
And as for his slow verbal development, he came to believe that it
allowed him to observe with wonder the everyday phenomena that others
took for granted. “When I ask myself how it happened that I in
particular discovered the relativity theory, it seemed to lie in the
following circumstance,” Einstein once explained. “The ordinary adult
never bothers his head about the problems of space and time. These are
things he has thought of as a child. But I developed so slowly that I
began to wonder about space and time only when I was already grown up.
Consequently, I probed more deeply into the problem than an ordinary
child would have.”3</p>
<p>Einstein’s developmental problems have probably been exaggerated,
perhaps even by himself, for we have some letters from his adoring
grandparents saying that he was just as clever and endearing as every
grandchild is. But throughout his life, Einstein had a mild form of
echolalia, causing him to repeat phrases to himself, two or three times,
especially if they amused him. And he generally preferred to think in
pictures, most notably in famous thought experiments, such as imagining
watching lightning strikes from a moving train or experiencing gravity
while inside a falling elevator. “I very rarely think in words at all,”
he later told a psychologist. “A thought comes, and I may try to express
it in words afterwards.”4</p>
<p>Einstein was descended, on both parents’ sides, from Jewish
trades-men and peddlers who had, for at least two centuries, made modest
livings in the rural villages of Swabia in southwestern Germany. With
each generation they had become, or at least so they thought,
increasingly assimilated into the German culture that they loved.
Although Jewish by cultural designation and kindred instinct, they
displayed scant interest in the religion or its rituals.</p>
<p>Einstein regularly dismissed the role that his heritage played in
shaping who he became. “Exploration of my ancestors,” he told a friend
late in life, “leads nowhere.”5 That’s not fully true. He was blessed by
being born into an independent-minded and intelligent family line that
valued education, and his life was certainly affected, in ways both
beautiful and tragic, by membership in a religious heritage that had a
distinctive intellectual tradition and a history of being both outsiders
and wanderers. Of course, the fact that he happened to be Jewish in
Germany in the early twentieth century made him more of an outsider, and
more of a wanderer, than he would have preferred—but that, too, became
integral to who he was and the role he would play in world history.</p>
<p>Einstein’s father, Hermann, was born in 1847 in the Swabian village
of Buchau, whose thriving Jewish community was just beginning to enjoy
the right to practice any vocation. Hermann showed “a marked inclination
for mathematics,”6 and his family was able to send him seventy-five
miles north to Stuttgart for high school. But they could not afford to
send him to a university, most of which were closed to Jews in any
event, so he returned home to Buchau to go into trade.</p>
<p>A few years later, as part of the general migration of rural German
Jews into industrial centers during the late nineteenth century, Hermann
and his parents moved thirty-five miles away to the more prosperous town
of Ulm, which prophetically boasted as its motto “Ulmenses sunt
mathematici,” the people of Ulm are mathematicians.7</p>
<p>There he became a partner in a cousin’s featherbed company. He was
“exceedingly friendly, mild and wise,” his son would recall.8 With a
gentleness that blurred into docility, Hermann was to prove inept as a
businessman and forever impractical in financial matters. But his
docility did make him well suited to be a genial family man and good
husband to a strong-willed woman. At age 29, he married Pauline Koch,
eleven years his junior.</p>
<p>Pauline’s father, Julius Koch, had built a considerable fortune as a
grain dealer and purveyor to the royal Württemberg court. Pauline
inherited his practicality, but she leavened his dour disposition with a
teasing wit edged with sarcasm and a laugh that could be both infectious
and wounding (traits she would pass on to her son). From all accounts,
the match between Hermann and Pauline was a happy one, with her strong
personality meshing “in complete harmony” with her husband’s
passivity.9</p>
<p>Their first child was born at 11:30 a.m. on Friday, March 14, 1879,
in Ulm, which had recently joined, along with the rest of Swabia, the
new German Reich. Initially, Pauline and Hermann had planned to name the
boy Abraham, after his paternal grandfather. But they came to feel, he
later said, that the name sounded “too Jewish.”10 So they kept the
initial A and named him Albert Einstein.</p>
<p>Munich</p>
<p>In 1880, just a year after Albert’s birth, Hermann’s featherbed
business foundered and he was persuaded to move to Munich by his brother
Jakob, who had opened a gas and electrical supply company there. Jakob,
the youngest of five siblings, had been able to get a higher education,
unlike Hermann, and he had qualified as an engineer. As they competed
for contracts to provide generators and electrical lighting to
municipalities in southern Germany, Jakob was in charge of the technical
side while Hermann provided a modicum of salesmanship skills plus,
perhaps more important, loans from his wife’s side of the family.11</p>
<p>Pauline and Hermann had a second and final child, a daughter, in
November 1881, who was named Maria but throughout her life used instead
the diminutive Maja. When Albert was shown his new sister for the first
time, he was led to believe that she was like a wonderful toy that he
would enjoy. His response was to look at her and exclaim, “Yes, but
where are the wheels?”12 It may not have been the most perceptive of
questions, but it did show that during his third year his language
challenges did not prevent him from making some memorable comments.
Despite a few childhood squabbles, Maja was to become her brother’s most
intimate soul mate.</p>
<p>The Einsteins settled into a comfortable home with mature trees and
an elegant garden in a Munich suburb for what was to be, at least
through most of Albert’s childhood, a respectable bourgeois existence.
Munich had been architecturally burnished by mad King Ludwig II
(1845–1886) and boasted a profusion of churches, art galleries, and
concert halls that favored the works of resident Richard Wagner. In
1882, just after the Einsteins arrived, the city had about 300,000
residents, 85 percent of them Catholics and 2 percent of them Jewish,
and it was the host of the first German electricity exhibition, at which
electric lights were introduced to the city streets.</p>
<p>Einstein’s back garden was often bustling with cousins and children.
But he shied from their boisterous games and instead “occupied himself
with quieter things.” One governess nicknamed him “Father Bore.” He was
generally a loner, a tendency he claimed to cherish throughout his life,
although his was a special sort of detachment that was interwoven with a
relish for camaraderie and intellectual companionship. “From the very
beginning he was inclined to separate himself from children his own age
and to engage in daydreaming and meditative musing,” according to
Philipp Frank, a longtime scientific colleague.13</p>
<p>He liked to work on puzzles, erect complex structures with his toy
building set, play with a steam engine that his uncle gave him, and
build houses of cards. According to Maja, Einstein was able to construct
card structures as high as fourteen stories. Even discounting the
recollections of a star-struck younger sister, there was probably a lot
of truth to her claim that “persistence and tenacity were obviously
already part of his character.”</p>
<p>He was also, at least as a young child, prone to temper tantrums. “At
such moments his face would turn completely yellow, the tip of his nose
snow-white, and he was no longer in control of himself,” Maja remembers.
Once, at age 5, he grabbed a chair and threw it at a tutor, who fled and
never returned. Maja’s head became the target of various hard objects.
“It takes a sound skull,” she later joked, “to be the sister of an
intellectual.” Unlike his persistence and tenacity, he eventually
outgrew his temper.14</p>
<p>To use the language of psychologists, the young Einstein’s ability to
systemize (identify the laws that govern a system) was far greater than
his ability to empathize (sense and care about what other humans are
feeling), which have led some to ask if he might have exhibited mild
symptoms of some developmental disorder.15 However, it is important to
note that, despite his aloof and occasionally rebellious manner, he did
have the ability to make close friends and to empathize both with
colleagues and humanity in general.</p>
<p>The great awakenings that happen in childhood are usually lost to
memory. But for Einstein, an experience occurred when he was 4 or 5 that
would alter his life and be etched forever in his mind—and in the
history of science.</p>
<p>He was sick in bed one day, and his father brought him a compass. He
later recalled being so excited as he examined its mysterious powers
that he trembled and grew cold. The fact that the magnetic needle
behaved as if influenced by some hidden force field, rather than through
the more familiar mechanical method involving touch or contact, produced
a sense of wonder that motivated him throughout his life. “I can still
remember—or at least I believe I can remember—that this experience made
a deep and lasting impression on me,” he wrote on one of the many
occasions he recounted the incident. “Something deeply hidden had to be
behind things.”16</p>
<p>“It’s an iconic story,” Dennis Overbye noted in Einstein in Love,“the
young boy trembling to the invisible order behind chaotic reality.” It
has been told in the movie IQ, in which Einstein, played by Walter
Matthau, wears the compass around his neck, and it is the focus of a
children’s book, Rescuing Albert’s Compass, by Shulamith Oppenheim,
whose father-in-law heard the tale from Einstein in 1911.17</p>
<p>After being mesmerized by the compass needle’s fealty to an unseen
field, Einstein would develop a lifelong devotion to field theories as a
way to describe nature. Field theories use mathematical quantities, such
as numbers or vectors or tensors, to describe how the conditions at any
point in space will affect matter or another field. For example, in a
gravitational or an electromagnetic field there are forces that could
act on a particle at any point, and the equations of a field theory
describe how these change as one moves through the region. The first
paragraph of his great 1905 paper on special relativity begins with a
consideration of the effects of electrical and magnetic fields; his
theory of general relativity is based on equations that describe a
gravitational field; and at the very end of his life he was doggedly
scribbling further field equations in the hope that they would form the
basis for a theory of everything. As the science historian Gerald Holton
has noted, Einstein regarded “the classical concept of the field the
greatest contribution to the scientific spirit.”18</p>
<p>His mother, an accomplished pianist, also gave him a gift at around
the same time, one that likewise would last throughout his life. She
arranged for him to take violin lessons. At first he chafed at the
mechanical discipline of the instruction. But after being exposed to
Mozart’s sonatas, music became both magical and emotional to him. “I
believe that love is a better teacher than a sense of duty,” he said,
“at least for me.”19</p>
<p>Soon he was playing Mozart duets, with his mother accompanying him on
the piano. “Mozart’s music is so pure and beautiful that I see it as a
reflection of the inner beauty of the universe itself,” he later told a
friend. “Of course,” he added in a remark that reflected his view of
math and physics as well as of Mozart, “like all great beauty, his music
was pure simplicity.”20</p>
<p>Music was no mere diversion. On the contrary, it helped him think.
“Whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or faced a
difficult challenge in his work,” said his son Hans Albert, “he would
take refuge in music and that would solve all his difficulties.” The
violin thus proved useful during the years he lived alone in Berlin,
wrestling with general relativity. “He would often play his violin in
his kitchen late at night, improvising melodies while he pondered
complicated problems,” a friend recalled. “Then, suddenly, in the middle
of playing, he would announce excitedly, ‘I’ve got it!’ As if by
inspiration, the answer to the problem would have come to him in the
midst of music.”21</p>
<p>His appreciation for music, and especially for Mozart, may have
reflected his feel for the harmony of the universe. As Alexander
Moszkowski, who wrote a biography of Einstein in 1920 based on
conversations with him, noted, “Music, Nature, and God became
intermingled in him in a complex of feeling, a moral unity, the trace of
which never vanished.”22</p>
<p>Throughout his life, Albert Einstein would retain the intuition and
the awe of a child. He never lost his sense of wonder at the magic of
nature’s phenomena—magnetic fields, gravity, inertia, acceleration,
light beams—which grown-ups find so commonplace. He retained the ability
to hold two thoughts in his mind simultaneously, to be puzzled when they
conflicted, and to marvel when he could smell an underlying unity.
“People like you and me never grow old,” he wrote a friend later in
life. “We never cease to stand like curious children before the great
mystery into which we were born.”23</p>
<p>School</p>
<p>In his later years, Einstein would tell an old joke about an agnostic
uncle, who was the only member of his family who went to synagogue. When
asked why he did so, the uncle would respond, “Ah, but you never know.”
Einstein’s parents, on the other hand, were “entirely irreligious” and
felt no compulsion to hedge their bets. They did not keep kosher or
attend synagogue, and his father referred to Jewish rituals as “ancient
superstitions.”24</p>
<p>Consequently, when Albert turned 6 and had to go to school, his
parents did not care that there was no Jewish one near their home.
Instead he went to the large Catholic school in their neighborhood, the
Petersschule. As the only Jew among the seventy students in his class,
Einstein took the standard course in Catholic religion and ended up
enjoying it immensely. Indeed, he did so well in his Catholic studies
that he helped his classmates with theirs.25</p>
<p>One day his teacher brought a large nail to the class.“The nails with
which Jesus was nailed to the cross looked like this,” he said.26
Nevertheless, Einstein later said that he felt no discrimination from
the teachers. “The teachers were liberal and made no distinction based
on denominations,” he wrote. His fellow students, however, were a
different matter. “Among the children at the elementary school,
anti-Semitism was prevalent,” he recalled.</p>
<p>Being taunted on his walks to and from school based on “racial
characteristics about which the children were strangely aware” helped
reinforce the sense of being an outsider, which would stay with him his
entire life. “Physical attacks and insults on the way home from school
were frequent, but for the most part not too vicious. Nevertheless, they
were sufficient to consolidate, even in a child, a lively sense of being
an outsider.”27</p>
<p>When he turned 9, Einstein moved up to a high school near the center
of Munich, the Luitpold Gymnasium, which was known as an enlightened
institution that emphasized math and science as well as Latin and Greek.
In addition, the school supplied a teacher to provide religious
instruction for him and other Jews.</p>
<p>Despite his parents’ secularism, or perhaps because of it, Einstein
rather suddenly developed a passionate zeal for Judaism. “He was so
fervent in his feelings that, on his own, he observed Jewish religious
strictures in every detail,” his sister recalled. He ate no pork, kept
kosher dietary laws, and obeyed the strictures of the Sabbath, all
rather difficult to do when the rest of his family had a lack of
interest bordering on disdain for such displays. He even composed his
own hymns for the glorification of God, which he sang to himself as he
walked home from school.28</p>
<p>One widely held belief about Einstein is that he failed math as a
student, an assertion that is made, often accompanied by the phrase “as
everyone knows,” by scores of books and thousands of websites designed
to reassure underachieving students. It even made it into the famous
“Ripley’s Believe It or Not!” newspaper column.</p>
<p>Alas, Einstein’s childhood offers history many savory ironies, but
this is not one of them. In 1935, a rabbi in Princeton showed him a
clipping of the Ripley’s column with the headline “Greatest Living
Mathematician Failed in Mathematics.” Einstein laughed. “I never failed
in mathematics,” he replied, correctly. “Before I was fifteen I had
mastered differential and integral calculus.”29</p>
<p>In fact, he was a wonderful student, at least intellectually. In
primary school, he was at the top of his class. “Yesterday Albert got
his grades,” his mother reported to an aunt when he was 7. “Once again
he was ranked first.” At the gymnasium, he disliked the mechanical
learning of languages such as Latin and Greek, a problem exacerbated by
what he later said was his “bad memory for words and texts.” But even in
these courses, Einstein consistently got top grades. Years later, when
Einstein celebrated his fiftieth birthday and there were stories about
how poorly the great genius had fared at the gymnasium, the school’s
current principal made a point of publishing a letter revealing how good
his grades actually were.30</p>
<p>As for math, far from being a failure, he was “far above the school
requirements.” By age 12, his sister recalled, “he already had a
predilection for solving complicated problems in applied arithmetic,”
and he decided to see if he could jump ahead by learning geometry and
algebra on his own. His parents bought him the textbooks in advance so
that he could master them over summer vacation. Not only did he learn
the proofs in the books, he tackled the new theories by trying to prove
them on his own. “Play and playmates were forgotten,” she noted. “For
days on end he sat alone, immersed in the search for a solution, not
giving up before he had found it.”31</p>
<p>His uncle Jakob Einstein, the engineer, introduced him to the joys of
algebra. “It’s a merry science,” he explained. “When the animal that we
are hunting cannot be caught, we call it X temporarily and continue to
hunt until it is bagged.” He went on to give the boy even more difficult
challenges, Maja recalled, “with good-natured doubts about his ability
to solve them.” When Einstein triumphed, as he invariably did, he “was
overcome with great happiness and was already then aware of the
direction in which his talents were leading him.”</p>
<p>Among the concepts that Uncle Jakob threw at him was the Pythagorean
theorem (the square of the lengths of the legs of a right triangle add
up to the square of the length of the hypotenuse). “After much effort I
succeeded in ‘proving’ this theorem on the basis of the similarity of
triangles,” Einstein recalled. Once again he was thinking in pictures.
“It seemed to me ‘evident’ that the relations of the sides of the
right-angled triangles would have to be completely determined by one of
the acute angles.”32</p>
<p>Maja, with the pride of a younger sister, called Einstein’s
Pythagorean proof “an entirely original new one.” Although perhaps new
to him, it is hard to imagine that Einstein’s approach, which was surely
similar to the standard ones based on the proportionality of the sides
of similar triangles, was completely original. Nevertheless, it did show
Einstein’s youthful appreciation that elegant theorems can be derived
from simple axioms—and the fact that he was in little danger of failing
math. “As a boy of 12, I was thrilled to see that it was possible to
find out truth by reasoning alone, without the help of any outside
experience,” he told a reporter from a high school newspaper in
Princeton years later. “I became more and more convinced that nature
could be understood as a relatively simple mathematical
structure.”33</p>
<p>Einstein’s greatest intellectual stimulation came from a poor medical
student who used to dine with his family once a week. It was an old
Jewish custom to take in a needy religious scholar to share the Sabbath
meal; the Einsteins modified the tradition by hosting instead a medical
student on Thursdays. His name was Max Talmud (later changed to Talmey,
when he immigrated to the United States), and he began his weekly visits
when he was 21 and Einstein was 10. “He was a pretty, dark-haired boy,”
remembered Talmud. “In all those years, I never saw him reading any
light literature. Nor did I ever see him in the company of schoolmates
or other boys his age.”34</p>
<p>Talmud brought him science books, including a popular illustrated
series called People’s Books on Natural Science, “a work which I read
with breathless attention,” said Einstein. The twenty-one little volumes
were written by Aaron Bernstein, who stressed the interrelations between
biology and physics, and he reported in great detail the scientific
experiments being done at the time, especially in Germany.35</p>
<p>In the opening section of the first volume, Bernstein dealt with the
speed of light, a topic that obviously fascinated him. Indeed, he
returned to it repeatedly in his subsequent volumes, including eleven
essays on the topic in volume 8. Judging from the thought experiments
that Einstein later used in creating his theory of relativity,
Bernstein’s books appear to have been influential.</p>
<p>For example, Bernstein asked readers to imagine being on a speeding
train. If a bullet is shot through the window, it would seem that it was
shot at an angle, because the train would have moved between the time
the bullet entered one window and exited the window on the other side.
Likewise, because of the speed of the earth through space, the same must
be true of light going through a telescope. What was amazing, said
Bernstein, was that experiments showed the same effect no matter how
fast the source of the light was moving. In a sentence that, because of
its relation to what Einstein would later famously conclude, seems to
have made an impression, Bernstein declared, “Since each kind of light
proves to be of exactly the same speed, the law of the speed of light
can well be called the most general of all of nature’s laws.”</p>
<p>In another volume, Bernstein took his young readers on an imaginary
trip through space. The mode of transport was the wave of an electric
signal. His books celebrated the joyful wonders of scientific
investigation and included such exuberant passages as this one written
about the successful prediction of the location of the new planet
Uranus: “Praised be this science! Praised be the men who do it! And
praised be the human mind, which sees more sharply than does the human
eye.”36</p>
<p>Bernstein was, as Einstein would later be, eager to tie together all
of nature’s forces. For example, after discussing how all
electromagnetic phenomena, such as light, could be considered waves, he
speculated that the same may be true for gravity. A unity and
simplicity, Bernstein wrote, lay beneath all the concepts applied by our
perceptions. Truth in science consisted in discovering theories that
described this underlying reality. Einstein later recalled the
revelation, and the realist attitude, that this instilled in him as a
young boy: “Out yonder there was this huge world, which exists
independently of us human beings and which stands before us like a
great, eternal riddle.”37</p>
<p>Years later, when they met in New York during Einstein’s first visit
there, Talmud asked what he thought, in retrospect, of Bernstein’s work.
“A very good book,” he said. “It has exerted a great influence on my
whole development.”38</p>
<p>Talmud also helped Einstein continue to explore the wonders of
mathematics by giving him a textbook on geometry two years before he was
scheduled to learn that subject in school. Later, Einstein would refer
to it as “the sacred little geometry book” and speak of it with awe:
“Here were assertions, as for example the intersection of the three
altitudes of a triangle in one point, which—though by no means
evident—could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any doubt
appeared to be out of the question. This lucidity and certainty made an
indescribable impression upon me.” Years later, in a lecture at Oxford,
Einstein noted, “If Euclid failed to kindle your youthful enthusiasm,
then you were not born to be a scientific thinker.”39</p>
<p>When Talmud arrived each Thursday, Einstein delighted in showing him
the problems he had solved that week. Initially, Talmud was able to help
him, but he was soon surpassed by his pupil. “After a short time, a few
months, he had worked through the whole book,” Talmud recalled. “He
thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics . . . Soon the flight of
his mathematical genius was so high that I could no longer
follow.”40</p>
<p>So the awed medical student moved on to introducing Einstein to
philosophy. “I recommended Kant to him,” he recalled. “At that time he
was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant’s works,
incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.” Kant
became, for a while, Einstein’s favorite philosopher, and his Critique
of Pure Reason eventually led him to delve also into David Hume, Ernst
Mach, and the issue of what can be known about reality.</p>
<p>Einstein’s exposure to science produced a sudden reaction against
religion at age 12, just as he would have been readying for a bar
mitzvah. Bernstein, in his popular science volumes, had reconciled
science with religious inclination. As he put it, “The religious
inclination lies in the dim consciousness that dwells in humans that all
nature, including the humans in it, is in no way an accidental game, but
a work of lawfulness, that there is a fundamental cause of all
existence.”</p>
<p>Einstein would later come close to these sentiments. But at the time,
his leap away from faith was a radical one. “Through the reading of
popular scientific books, I soon reached the conviction that much in the
stories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively
fanatic orgy of freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is
intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a
crushing impression.”41</p>
<p>As a result, Einstein avoided religious rituals for the rest of his
life. “There arose in Einstein an aversion to the orthodox practice of
the Jewish or any traditional religion, as well as to attendance at
religious services, and this he has never lost,” his friend Philipp
Frank later noted. He did, however, retain from his childhood religious
phase a profound reverence for the harmony and beauty of what he called
the mind of God as it was expressed in the creation of the universe and
its laws.42</p>
<p>Einstein’s rebellion against religious dogma had a profound effect on
his general outlook toward received wisdom. It inculcated an allergic
reaction against all forms of dogma and authority, which was to affect
both his politics and his science. “Suspicion against every kind of
authority grew out of this experience, an attitude which has never again
left me,” he later said. Indeed, it was this comfort with being a
nonconformist that would define both his science and his social thinking
for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>He would later be able to pull off this contrariness with a grace
that was generally endearing, once he was accepted as a genius. But it
did not play so well when he was merely a sassy student at a Munich
gymnasium. “He was very uncomfortable in school,” according to his
sister. He found the style of teaching—rote drills, impatience with
questioning—to be repugnant. “The military tone of the school, the
systematic training in the worship of authority that was supposed to
accustom pupils at an early age to military discipline, was particularly
unpleasant.”43</p>
<p>Even in Munich, where the Bavarian spirit engendered a less
regimented approach to life, this Prussian glorification of the military
had taken hold, and many of the children loved to play at being
soldiers. When troops would come by, accompanied by fifes and drums,
kids would pour into the streets to join the parade and march in
lockstep. But not Einstein. Watching such a display once, he began to
cry. “When I grow up, I don’t want to be one of those poor people,” he
told his parents. As Einstein later explained, “When a person can take
pleasure in marching in step to a piece of music it is enough to make me
despise him. He has been given his big brain only by mistake.”44</p>
<p>The opposition he felt to all types of regimentation made his
education at the Munich gymnasium increasingly irksome and contentious.
The mechanical learning there, he complained, “seemed very much akin to
the methods of the Prussian army, where a mechanical discipline was
achieved by repeated execution of meaningless orders.” In later years,
he would liken his teachers to members of the military. “The teachers at
the elementary school seemed to me like drill sergeants,” he said, “and
the teachers at the gymnasium like lieutenants.”</p>
<p>He once asked C. P. Snow, the British writer and scientist, whether
he was familiar with the German word Zwang. Snow allowed that he was; it
meant constraint, compulsion, obligation, coercion. Why? In his Munich
school, Einstein answered, he had made his first strike against Zwang,
and it had helped define him ever since.45</p>
<p>Skepticism and a resistance to received wisdom became a hallmark of
his life. As he proclaimed in a letter to a fatherly friend in 1901, “A
foolish faith in authority is the worst enemy of truth.”46</p>
<p>Throughout the six decades of his scientific career, whether leading
the quantum revolution or later resisting it, this attitude helped shape
Einstein’s work. “His early suspicion of authority, which never wholly
left him, was to prove of decisive importance,” said Banesh Hoffmann,
who was a collaborator of Einstein’s in his later years. “Without it he
would not have been able to develop the powerful independence of mind
that gave him the courage to challenge established scientific beliefs
and thereby revolutionize physics.”47</p>
<p>This contempt for authority did not endear him to the German
“lieutenants” who taught him at his school. As a result, one of his
teachers proclaimed that his insolence made him unwelcome in class. When
Einstein insisted that he had committed no offense, the teacher replied,
“Yes, that is true, but you sit there in the back row and smile, and
your mere presence here spoils the respect of the class for me.”48</p>
<p>Einstein’s discomfort spiraled toward depression, perhaps even close
to a nervous breakdown, when his father’s business suffered a sudden
reversal of fortune. The collapse was a precipitous one. During most of
Einstein’s school years, the Einstein brothers’ company had been a
success. In 1885, it had two hundred employees and provided the first
electrical lights for Munich’s Oktoberfest. Over the next few years, it
won the contract to wire the community of Schwabing, a Munich suburb of
ten thousand people, using gas motors to drive twin dynamos that the
Einsteins had designed. Jakob Einstein received six patents for
improvements in arc lamps, automatic circuit breakers, and electric
meters. The company was poised to rival Siemens and other power
companies then flourishing. To raise capital, the brothers mortgaged
their homes, borrowed more than 60,000 marks at 10 percent interest, and
went deeply in debt.49</p>
<p>But in 1894, when Einstein was 15, the company went bust after it
lost competitions to light the central part of Munich and other
locations. His parents and sister, along with Uncle Jakob, moved to
northern Italy—first Milan and then the nearby town of Pavia—where the
company’s Italian partners thought there would be more fertile territory
for a smaller firm. Their elegant home was torn down by a developer to
build an apartment block. Einstein was left behind in Munich, at the
house of a distant relative, to finish his final three years of
school.</p>
<p>It is not quite clear whether Einstein, in that sad autumn of 1894,
was actually forced to leave the Luitpold Gymnasium or was merely
politely encouraged to leave. Years later, he recalled that the teacher
who had declared that his “presence spoils the respect of the class for
me” had gone on to “express the wish that I leave the school.” An early
book by a member of his family said that it was his own decision.
“Albert increasingly resolved not to remain in Munich, and he worked out
a plan.”</p>
<p>That plan involved getting a letter from the family doctor, Max
Talmud’s older brother, who certified that he was suffering from nervous
exhaustion. He used this to justify leaving the school at Christmas
vacation in 1894 and not returning. Instead, he took a train across the
Alps to Italy and informed his “alarmed” parents that he was never going
back to Germany. Instead, he promised, he would study on his own and
attempt to gain admission to a technical college in Zurich the following
autumn.</p>
<p>There was perhaps one other factor in his decision to leave Germany.
Had he remained there until he was 17, just over a year away, he would
have been required to join the army, a prospect that his sister said “he
contemplated with dread.” So, in addition to announcing that he would
not go back to Munich, he would soon ask for his father’s help in
renouncing his German citizenship.50</p>
<p>Aarau</p>
<p>Einstein spent the spring and summer of 1895 living with his parents
in their Pavia apartment and helping at the family firm. In the process,
he was able to get a good feel for the workings of magnets, coils, and
generated electricity. Einstein’s work impressed his family. On one
occasion, Uncle Jakob was having problems with some calculations for a
new machine, so Einstein went to work on it. “After my assistant
engineer and I had been racking our brain for days, that young sprig had
got the whole thing in just fifteen minutes,” Jakob reported to a
friend. “You will hear of him yet.”51</p>
<p>With his love of the sublime solitude found in the mountains,
Einstein hiked for days in the Alps and Apennines, including an
excursion from Pavia to Genoa to see his mother’s brother Julius Koch.
Wherever he traveled in northern Italy, he was delighted by the
non-Germanic grace and “delicacy” of the people. Their “naturalness” was
a contrast to the “spiritually broken and mechanically obedient
automatons” of Germany, his sister recalled.</p>
<p>Einstein had promised his family that he would study on his own to
get into the local technical college, the Zurich Polytechnic.* So he
bought all three volumes of Jules Violle’s advanced physics text and
copiously noted his ideas in the margins. His work habits showed his
ability to concentrate, his sister recalled. “Even in a large, quite
noisy group, he could withdraw to the sofa, take pen and paper in hand,
set the inkstand precariously on the armrest, and lose himself so
completely in a problem that the conversation of many voices stimulated
rather than disturbed him.”52</p>
<p>That summer, at age 16, he wrote his first essay on theoretical
physics, which he titled “On the Investigation of the State of the Ether
in a Magnetic Field.” The topic was important, for the notion of the
ether would play a critical role in Einstein’s career. At the time,
scientists conceived of light simply as a wave, and so they assumed that
the universe must contain an all-pervasive yet unseen substance that was
doing the rippling and thus propagating the waves, just as water was the
medium rippling up and down and thus propagating the waves in an ocean.
They dubbed this the ether, and Einstein (at least for the time being)
went along with the assumption. As he put it in his essay, “An electric
current sets the surrounding ether in a kind of momentary motion.”</p>
<p>The fourteen-paragraph handwritten paper echoed Violle’s textbook as
well as some of the reports in the popular science magazines about
Heinrich Hertz’s recent discoveries about electromagnetic waves. In it,
Einstein made suggestions for experiments that could explain “the
magnetic field formed around an electric current.” This would be
interesting, he argued, “because the exploration of the elastic state of
the ether in this case would permit us a look into the enigmatic nature
of electric current.”</p>
<p>The high school dropout freely admitted that he was merely making a
few suggestions without knowing where they might lead. “As I was
completely lacking in materials that would have enabled me to delve into
the subject more deeply than by merely meditating about it, I beg you
not to interpret this circumstance as a mark of superficiality,” he
wrote.53</p>
<p>He sent the paper to his uncle Caesar Koch, a merchant in Belgium,
who was one of his favorite relatives and occasionally a financial
patron. “It is rather naïve and imperfect, as might be expected from
such a young fellow like myself,” Einstein confessed with a pretense of
humility. He added that his goal was to enroll the following fall at the
Zurich Polytechnic, but he was concerned that he was younger than the
age requirement. “I should be at least two years older.”54</p>
<p>To help him get around the age requirement, a family friend wrote to
the director of the Polytechnic, asking for an exception. The tone of
the letter can be gleaned from the director’s response, which expressed
skepticism about admitting this “so-called ‘child prodigy.’”
Nevertheless, Einstein was granted permission to take the entrance exam,
and he boarded the train for Zurich in October 1895 “with a sense of
well-founded diffidence.”</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, he easily passed the section of the exam in math
and science. But he failed to pass the general section, which included
sections on literature, French, zoology, botany, and politics. The
Polytechnic’s head physics professor, Heinrich Weber, suggested that
Einstein stay in Zurich and audit his classes. Instead, Einstein
decided, on the advice of the college’s director, to spend a year
preparing at the cantonal school in the village of Aarau, twenty-five
miles to the west.55</p>
<p>It was a perfect school for Einstein. The teaching was based on the
philosophy of a Swiss educational reformer of the early nineteenth
century, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, who believed in encouraging
students to visualize images. He also thought it important to nurture
the “inner dignity” and individuality of each child. Students should be
allowed to reach their own conclusions, Pestalozzi preached, by using a
series of steps that began with hands-on observations and then proceeded
to intuitions, conceptual thinking, and visual imagery.56 It was even
possible to learn—and truly understand—the laws of math and physics that
way. Rote drills, memorization, and force-fed facts were avoided.</p>
<p>Einstein loved Aarau. “Pupils were treated individually,” his sister
recalled, “more emphasis was placed on independent thought than on
punditry, and young people saw the teacher not as a figure of authority,
but, alongside the student, a man of distinct personality.” It was the
opposite of the German education that Einstein had hated. “When compared
to six years’ schooling at a German authoritarian gymnasium,” Einstein
later said, “it made me clearly realize how much superior an education
based on free action and personal responsibility is to one relying on
outward authority.”57</p>
<p>The visual understanding of concepts, as stressed by Pestalozzi and
his followers in Aarau, became a significant aspect of Einstein’s
genius. “Visual understanding is the essential and only true means of
teaching how to judge things correctly,” Pestalozzi wrote, and “the
learning of numbers and language must be definitely subordinated.”58</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, it was at this school that Einstein first engaged
in the visualized thought experiment that would help make him the
greatest scientific genius of his time: he tried to picture what it
would be like to ride alongside a light beam. “In Aarau I made my first
rather childish experiments in thinking that had a direct bearing on the
Special Theory,” he later told a friend. “If a person could run after a
light wave with the same speed as light, you would have a wave
arrangement which could be completely independent of time. Of course,
such a thing is impossible.”59</p>
<p>This type of visualized thought experiments—Gedankenexperiment—became
a hallmark of Einstein’s career. Over the years, he would picture in his
mind such things as lightning strikes and moving trains, accelerating
elevators and falling painters, two-dimensional blind beetles crawling
on curved branches, as well as a variety of contraptions designed to
pinpoint, at least in theory, the location and velocity of speeding
electrons.</p>
<p>While a student in Aarau, Einstein boarded with a wonderful family,
the Wintelers, whose members would long remain entwined in his life.
There was Jost Winteler, who taught history and Greek at the school; his
wife, Rosa, soon known to Einstein as Mamerl, or Mama; and their seven
children. Their daughter Marie would become Einstein’s first girlfriend.
Another daughter, Anna, would marry Einstein’s best friend, Michele
Besso. And their son Paul would marry Einstein’s beloved sister,
Maja.</p>
<p>“Papa” Jost Winteler was a liberal who shared Einstein’s allergy to
German militarism and to nationalism in general. His edgy honesty and
political idealism helped to shape Einstein’s social philosophy. Like
his mentor, Einstein would become a supporter of world federalism,
internationalism, pacifism, and democratic socialism, with a strong
devotion to individual liberty and freedom of expression.</p>
<p>More important, in the warm embrace of the Winteler family, Einstein
became more secure and personable. Even though he still fancied himself
a loner, the Wintelers helped him flower emotionally and open himself to
intimacy. “He had a great sense of humor and at times could laugh
heartily,” recalled daughter Anna. In the evenings he would sometimes
study, “but more often he would sit with the family around the
table.”60</p>
<p>Einstein had developed into a head-turning teenager who possessed, in
the words of one woman who knew him, “masculine good looks of the type
that played havoc at the turn of the century.” He had wavy dark hair,
expressive eyes, a high forehead, and jaunty demeanor. “The lower half
of his face might have belonged to a sensualist who found plenty of
reasons to love life.”</p>
<p>One of his schoolmates, Hans Byland, later wrote a striking
description of “the impudent Swabian” who made such a lasting
impression. “Sure of himself, his gray felt hat pushed back on his
thick, black hair, he strode energetically up and down in the rapid, I
might say crazy, tempo of a restless spirit which carries a whole world
in itself. Nothing escaped the sharp gaze of the large bright brown
eyes. Whoever approached him was captivated by his superior personality.
A mocking curl of his fleshy mouth with its protruding lower lip did not
encourage Philistines to fraternize with him.”</p>
<p>Most notably, Byland added, young Einstein had a sassy, sometimes
intimidating wit. “He confronted the world spirit as a laughing
philosopher, and his witty sarcasm mercilessly castigated all vanity and
artificiality.”61</p>
<p>Einstein fell in love with Marie Winteler at the end of 1895, just a
few months after he moved in with her parents. She had just completed
teacher training college and was living at home while waiting to take a
job in a nearby village. She was just turning 18, he was still 16. The
romance thrilled both families. Albert and Marie sent New Year’s
greetings to his mother; she replied warmly, “Your little letter, dear
Miss Marie, brought me immense joy.”62</p>
<p>The following April, when he was back home in Pavia for spring break,
Einstein wrote Marie his first known love letter:</p>
<p>Beloved sweetheart!</p>
<p>Many, many thanks sweetheart for your charming little letter, which
made me endlessly happy. It was so wonderful to be able to press to
one’s heart such a bit of paper which two so dear little eyes have
lovingly beheld and on which the dainty little hands have charmingly
glided back and forth. I was now made to realize, my little angel, the
meaning of homesickness and pining. But love brings much happiness—much
more so than pining brings pain . . .</p>
<p>My mother has also taken you to her heart, even though she does not
know you; I only let her read two of your charming little letters. And
she always laughs at me because I am no longer attracted to the girls
who were supposed to have enchanted me so much in the past. You mean
more to my soul than the whole world did before.</p>
<p>To which his mother penned a postscript: “Without having read this
letter, I send you cordial greetings!”63</p>
<p>Although he enjoyed the school in Aarau, Einstein turned out to be an
uneven student. His admission report noted that he needed to do remedial
work in chemistry and had “great gaps” in his knowledge of French. By
midyear, he still was required to “continue with private lessons in
French andandandand chemistry,” and “the protest in French remains in
effect.” His father was sanguine when Jost Winteler sent him the midyear
report. “Not all its parts fulfill my wishes and expectations,” he
wrote, “but with Albert I got used to finding mediocre grades along with
very good ones, and I am therefore not disconsolate about them.”64</p>
<p>Music continued to be a passion. There were nine violinists in his
class, and their teacher noted that they suffered from “some stiffness
in bowing technique here and there.” But Einstein was singled out for
praise: “One student, by the name of Einstein, even sparkled by
rendering an adagio from a Beethoven sonata with deep understanding.” At
a concert in the local church, Einstein was chosen to play first violin
in a piece by Bach. His “enchanting tone and incomparable rhythm” awed
the second violinist, who asked, “Do you count the beats?” Einstein
replied, “Heavens no, it’s in my blood.”</p>
<p>His classmate Byland recalled Einstein playing a Mozart sonata with
such passion—“What fire there was in his playing!”—that it seemed like
hearing the composer for the first time. Listening to him, Byland
realized that Einstein’s wisecracking, sarcastic exterior was a shell
around a softer inner soul. “He was one of those split personalities who
know how to protect, with a prickly exterior, the delicate realm of
their intense personal life.”65</p>
<p>Einstein’s contempt for Germany’s authoritarian schools and
militarist atmosphere made him want to renounce his citizenship in that
country. This was reinforced by Jost Winteler, who disdained all forms
of nationalism and instilled in Einstein the belief that people should
consider themselves citizens of the world. So he asked his father to
help him drop his German citizenship. The release came through in
January 1896, and for the time being he was stateless.66</p>
<p>He also that year became a person without a religious affiliation. In
the application to renounce his German citizenship, his father had
written, presumably at Albert’s request, “no religious denomination.” It
was a statement Albert would also make when applying for Zurich
residency a few years later, and on various occasions over the ensuing
two decades.</p>
<p>His rebellion from his childhood fling with ardent Judaism, coupled
with his feelings of detachment from Munich’s Jews, had alienated him
from his heritage. “The religion of the fathers, as I encountered it in
Munich during religious instruction and in the synagogue, repelled
rather than attracted me,” he later explained to a Jewish historian.
“The Jewish bourgeois circles that I came to know in my younger years,
with their affluence and lack of a sense of community, offered me
nothing that seemed to be of value.”67</p>
<p>Later in life, beginning with his exposure to virulent anti-Semitism
in the 1920s, Einstein would begin to reconnect with his Jewish
identity. “There is nothing in me that can be described as a ‘Jewish
faith,’” he said, “however I am happy to be a member of the Jewish
people.” Later he would make the same point in more colorful ways. “The
Jew who abandons his faith,” he once said, “is in a similar position to
a snail that abandons his shell. He is still a snail.”68</p>
<p>His renunciation of Judaism in 1896 should, therefore, be seen not as
a clean break but as part of a lifelong evolution of his feelings about
his cultural identity. “At that time I would not even have understood
what leaving Judaism could possibly mean,” he wrote a friend the year
before he died. “But I was fully aware of my Jewish origin, even though
the full significance of belonging to Jewry was not realized by me until
later.”69</p>
<p>Einstein ended his year at the Aarau school in a manner that would
have seemed impressive for anyone except one of history’s great
geniuses, scoring the second highest grades in his class. (Alas, the
name of the boy who bested Einstein is lost to history.) On a 1 to 6
scale, with 6 being the highest, he scored a 5 or 6 in all of his
science and math courses as well as in history and Italian. His lowest
grade was a 3, in French.</p>
<p>That qualified him to take a series of exams, written and oral, that
would permit him, if he passed, to enter the Zurich Polytechnic. On his
German exam, he did a perfunctory outline of a Goethe play and scored a
5. In math, he made a careless mistake, calling a number “imaginary”
when he meant “irrational,” but still got a top grade. In physics, he
arrived late and left early, completing the two-hour test in an hour and
fifteen minutes; he got the top grade. Altogether, he ended up with a
5.5, the best grade among the nine students taking the exams.</p>
<p>The one section on which he did poorly was French. But his
three-paragraph essay was, to those of us today, the most interesting
part of all of his exams. The topic was “Mes Projets d’avenir,” my plans
for the future. Although the French was not memorable, the personal
insights were:</p>
<p>If I am lucky and pass my exams, I will enroll in the Zurich
Polytechnic. I will stay there four years to study mathematics and
physics. I suppose I will become a teacher in these fields of science,
opting for the theoretical part of these sciences.</p>
<p>Here are the reasons that have led me to this plan. They are, most of
all, my personal talent for abstract and mathematical thinking … My
desires have also led me to the same decision. That is quite natural;
everybody desires to do that for which he has a talent. Besides, I am
attracted by the independence offered by the profession of
science.70</p>
<p>In the summer of 1896, the Einstein brothers’ electrical business
again failed, this time because they bungled getting the necessary water
rights to build a hydroelectric system in Pavia. The partnership was
dissolved in a friendly fashion, and Jakob joined a large firm as an
engineer. But Hermann, whose optimism and pride tended to overwhelm any
prudence, insisted on opening yet another new dynamo business, this time
in Milan. Albert was so dubious of his father’s prospects that he went
to his relatives and suggested that they not finance him again, but they
did.71</p>
<p>Hermann hoped that Albert would someday join him in the business, but
engineering held little appeal for him. “I was originally supposed to
become an engineer,” he later wrote a friend, “but the thought of having
to expend my creative energy on things that make practical everyday life
even more refined, with a bleak capital gain as the goal, was unbearable
to me. Thinking for its own sake, like music!”72 And thus he headed off
to the Zurich Polytechnic.</p>
