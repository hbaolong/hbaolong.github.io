<h4 id="chapter-thirteen-the-wandering-zionist">CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE
WANDERING ZIONIST</h4>
<p>1920–1921</p>
<p>The motorcade in New York City, April 4, 1921</p>
<p>Kinship</p>
<p>In the article he wrote for The Times of London after the
confirmation of his relativity theory, Einstein quipped that if things
went bad the Germans would no longer consider him a compatriot but
instead a Swiss Jew. It was a clever remark, made more so because
Einstein knew, even then, that there was an odious smell of truth to it.
That very week, in a letter to his friend Paul Ehrenfest, he described
the mood in Germany. “Anti-Semitism is very strong here,” he wrote.
“Where is this all supposed to lead?”1</p>
<p>The rise of German anti-Semitism after World War I produced a
counterreaction in Einstein: it made him identify more strongly with his
Jewish heritage and community. At one extreme were German Jews such as
Fritz Haber, who did everything they could, including converting to
Christianity, to assimilate, and they urged Einstein to do the same. But
Einstein took the opposite approach. Just when he was becoming famous,
he embraced the Zionist cause. He did not officially join any Zionist
organization, nor for that matter did he belong to or worship at any
synagogue. But he cast his lot in favor of Jewish settlements in
Palestine, a national identity among Jews everywhere, and the rejection
of assimilationist desires.</p>
<p>He was recruited by the pioneering Zionist leader Kurt Blumenfeld,
who paid a call on Einstein in Berlin in early 1919. “With extreme
naïveté he asked questions,” Blumenfeld recalled. Among Einstein’s
queries: With their spiritual and intellectual gifts, why should Jews be
called on to create an agricultural nation-state? Wasn’t nationalism the
problem rather than the solution?</p>
<p>Eventually, Einstein came around to the cause. “I am, as a human
being, an opponent of nationalism,” he declared. “But as a Jew, I am
from today a supporter of the Zionist effort.”2 He also became, more
specifically, an advocate for the creation of a new Jewish university in
Palestine, which eventually became Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Once he decided to abandon the postulate that all forms of
nationalism were bad, he found it easy to embrace Zionism with greater
enthusiasm. “One can be an internationalist without being indifferent to
members of one’s tribe,” he wrote a friend in October 1919. “The Zionist
cause is very close to my heart …I am glad that there should be a little
patch of earth on which our kindred brethren are not considered
aliens.”3</p>
<p>His support for Zionism put Einstein at odds with assimilationists.
In April 1920, he was invited to address a meeting of one such group
that emphasized its members’ loyalty to Germany, the German Citizens of
the Jewish Faith. He replied by accusing them of trying to separate
themselves from the poorer and less polished eastern European Jews. “Can
the ‘Aryan’ respect such pussyfooters?” he chided.4</p>
<p>Privately declining the invitation was not enough. Einstein also felt
compelled to write a public attack on those who tried to fit in by
talking “about religious faith instead of tribal affiliation.”* In
particular, he scorned what he called “the assimilatory” approach that
sought “to overcome anti-Semitism by dropping nearly everything Jewish.”
This never worked; indeed, it “appears somewhat comical to a non-Jew,”
because the Jews are a people set apart from others. “The psychological
root of anti-Semitism lies in the fact that the Jews are a group of
people unto themselves,” he wrote. “Their Jewishness is visible in their
physical appearance, and one notices their Jewish heritage in their
intellectual work.”5</p>
<p>The Jews who practiced and preached assimilation tended to be those
who took pride in their German or western European heritage. At the time
(and through much of the twentieth century), they tended to look down on
Jews from eastern Europe, such as Russia and Poland, who seemed less
polished, refined, and assimilated. Although Einstein was German Jewish,
he was appalled by those from his background who would “draw a sharp
dividing line between eastern European Jews and western European Jews.”
The approach was doomed to backfire against all Jews, he argued, and it
was not based on any true distinction. “Eastern European Jewry contains
a rich potential of human talents and productive forces that can well
stand the comparison to the higher civilization of western European
Jews.”6</p>
<p>Einstein was acutely aware, even more than the assimilationists, that
anti-Semitism was not the result of rational causes. “In Germany today
hatred of the Jews has taken on horrible expressions,” he wrote in early
1920. Part of the problem was that inflation was out of control. The
German mark had been worth about 12 cents at the beginning of 1919,
which was half of its value from before the war but still manageable.
But by the beginning of 1920, the mark was worth a mere 2 cents, and
collapsing further each month.</p>
<p>In addition, the loss of the war had been humiliating. Germany had
lost 6 million men and then was forced into surrendering land containing
half of its natural resources, plus all of its overseas colonies. Many
proud Germans believed it must have been the result of betrayal. The
Weimar Republic that had emerged after the war, though supported by
liberals and pacifists and Jews such as Einstein, was disdained by much
of the old order and even the middle class.</p>
<p>There was one group that could be easily cast as the alien and dark
force most responsible for the humiliation facing a proud
culture.“People need a scapegoat and make the Jews responsible,”
Einstein noted. “They are a target of instinctive resentment because
they are of a different tribe.”7</p>
<p>Weyland, Lenard, and the Antirelativists</p>
<p>The explosion of great art and ideas in Germany at the time, as Amos
Elon wrote in his book The Pity of It All, was largely due to Jewish
patrons and pioneers in a variety of fields. This was particularly true
in science. As Sigmund Freud pointed out, part of the success of Jewish
scientists was their “creative skepticism,” which arose from their
essential nature as outsiders.8 What the Jewish assimilationists
underestimated was the virulence with which many Germans, whom they
considered to be their fellow countrymen, in fact saw them as
essentially outsiders or, as Einstein put it, “a different tribe.”</p>
<p>Einstein’s first public collision with this anti-Semitism came in the
summer of 1920. A shady German nationalist named Paul Weyland, an
engineer by training, had turned himself into a polemicist with
political aspirations. He was an active member of a right-wing
nationalistic political party that pledged, in its 1920 official
program, to “diminish the dominant Jewish influence showing up
increasingly in government and in public.”9</p>
<p>Weyland realized that Einstein, as a highly publicized Jew, had
engendered resentment and jealousy. Likewise, his relativity theory was
easy to turn into a target, because many people, including some
scientists, were unnerved by the way it seemed to undermine absolutes
and be built on abstract hypotheses rather than grounded in solid
experiment. So Weyland published articles denouncing relativity as “a
big hoax” and formed a ragtag (but mysteriously well-funded)
organization grandly dubbed the Study Group of German Scientists for the
Preservation of a Pure Science.</p>
<p>Joining with Weyland was an experimental physicist of modest
reputation named Ernst Gehrcke, who for years had been assailing
relativity with more vehemence than comprehension. Their group lobbed a
few personal attacks at Einstein and the “Jewish nature” of relativity
theory, then called a series of meetings around Germany, including a
large rally at Berlin’s Philharmonic Hall on August 24.</p>
<p>Weyland spoke first and, with the orotund rhetoric of a demagogue,
accused Einstein of engaging in a “businesslike booming of his theory
and his name.” Einstein’s penchant for publicity, wanted or not, was
being used against him, as his assimilationist friends had warned.
Relativity was a hoax, Weyland said, and plagiarized to boot. Gehrcke
said much the same with a more technical gloss, reading from a written
text. The meeting, reported the New York Times, “had a decidedly
antiSemitic complexion.”10</p>
<p>In the middle of Gehrcke’s talk, there arose from the audience a
quiet murmur:Einstein, Einstein. He had come to see the circus and,
averse neither to publicity nor controversy, laugh at the spectacle. As
his friend Philipp Frank noted, “He always liked to regard events in the
world around him as if he were a spectator in a theater.” Sitting in the
audience with his friend the chemist Walther Nernst, he cackled loudly
at times and at the end pronounced the entire event “most
amusing.”11</p>
<p>But he was not truly amused, and he even briefly considered moving
away from Berlin.12 His anger aroused, he made the tactical mistake of
responding with a highly charged diatribe that was published three days
later on the front page of the Berliner Tageblatt, a liberal daily owned
by Jewish friends. “I am well aware that the two speakers are unworthy
of reply by my pen,” he said, but then proceeded not to be restrained by
that awareness. Gehrcke and Weyland had not been explicitly
anti-Semitic, nor did they overtly criticize Jews in their speeches. But
Einstein alleged that they would not have attacked his theory “if I were
a German nationalist, with or without a swastika, instead of a
Jew.”13</p>
<p>Einstein spent most of his piece refuting Weyland and Gehrcke. But he
also attacked a more reputable physicist who was not at the meeting but
had given support to the antirelativity cause: Philipp Lenard.</p>
<p>Winner of the 1905 Nobel Prize, Lenard had been a pioneer
experimenter who described the photoelectric effect. Einstein had once
admired him. “I have just read a wonderful paper by Lenard,” Einstein
had gushed to Mari back in 1901. “Under this beautiful piece I am filled
with such happiness and joy that I absolutely must share some of it with
you.” After Einstein had published his first spate of seminal papers in
1905, citing Lenard by name in the one on light quanta, the two
scientists had exchanged flattering letters.14</p>
<p>But as an ardent German nationalist, Lenard had become increasingly
bitter about the British and the Jews, contemptuous of the publicity
Einstein’s theory was garnering, and vocal in his attacks on the
“absurd” aspects of relativity. He had allowed his name to be used on
brochures that were distributed at Weyland’s meeting, and as a Nobel
laureate he had worked behind the scenes to make sure that Einstein was
not awarded the prize.</p>
<p>Because Lenard had refrained from showing up at the Philharmonic Hall
rally, and because his published critiques of relativity had been
academic in tone, Einstein did not need to attack him in his newspaper
piece. But he did. “I admire Lenard as a master of experimental physics,
but he has not yet produced anything outstanding in theoretical physics,
and his objections to the general theory of relativity are of such
superficiality that, up until now, I did not think it necessary to
answer them,” he wrote. “I intend to make up for this.”15</p>
<p>Einstein’s friends publicly supported him. A group that included von
Laue and Nernst published a letter claiming, not altogether accurately,
“Whoever is fortunate enough to be close to Einstein knows that he will
never be surpassed in his . . . dislike of all publicity.”16</p>
<p>Privately, however, his friends were appalled. He had been provoked
into a display of public anger against those who should have remained
unworthy of a reply by his pen, thus stirring up even more distasteful
publicity. Max Born’s wife, Hedwig, who had freely scolded Einstein
about his treatment of his family, now lectured, “[You should] not have
allowed yourself to be goaded into that rather unfortunate reply.” He
should show more respect, she said, for “the secluded temple of
science.”17</p>
<p>Paul Ehrenfest was even harsher. “My wife and I absolutely cannot
believe that you yourself wrote some of the phrases in the article,” he
said. “If you really did write them down with your own hand, it proves
that these damn pigs have finally succeeded in touching your soul. I
urge you as strongly as I can not to throw one more word on this subject
to that voracious beast, the public.”18</p>
<p>Einstein was somewhat contrite. “Don’t be too severe with me,” he
replied to the Borns. “Everyone must, from time to time, make a
sacrifice on the altar of stupidity, to please the deity and mankind.
And I did so thoroughly with my article.”19 But he made no apologies for
flunking their standards of publicity avoidance. “I had to do this if I
wanted to stay in Berlin, where every child recognizes me from
photographs,” he told Ehrenfest. “If one believes in democracy, then one
must grant the public this much right as well.”20</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Lenard was outraged by Einstein’s article. He
insisted on an apology, as he had not even been part of the
antirelativity rally. Arnold Sommerfeld, chairman of the German Physical
Society, tried to mediate, and he urged Einstein “to write some
conciliatory words to Lenard.”21 It was not to be. Einstein refused to
back down, and Lenard ended up edging ever closer to being an outright
antiSemite and later a Nazi.</p>
<p>(There was one odd coda to this event. In 1953, according to
declassified documents in Einstein’s FBI file, a well-dressed German
walked into the FBI field office in Miami and told the receptionist he
had information that Einstein had admitted to being a communist in an
article in Berliner Tageblatt in August 1920. The aspiring informer was
none other than Paul Weyland, who had landed in Miami and was trying to
emigrate after years of being a con man and swindler all over the world.
J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI was eagerly trying to prove, with no success, that
Einstein was a communist, and took up the cause. After three months, the
Bureau finally found the article and translated it. There was nothing
about being a communist in it. Weyland was, nevertheless, granted
American citizenship.)22</p>
<p>The public crossfire coming out of the antirelativity rally
heightened interest in the upcoming annual meeting of German scientists,
scheduled for late September in the spa town of Bad Nauheim. Both
Einstein and Lenard were to attend, and Einstein had ended his newspaper
response by proclaiming that, at his suggestion, a public discussion of
relativity would occur there. “Anyone who can dare face a scientific
forum can present his objections there,” he said, tossing a gauntlet in
Lenard’s direction.</p>
<p>During the weeklong gathering in Bad Nauheim, Einstein stayed with
Max Born in Frankfurt, twenty miles away, and the two men commuted to
the resort town by train each day. The big showdown over relativity, at
which both Einstein and Lenard were expected to participate, was on the
afternoon of September 23. Einstein had forgotten to bring anything to
write with, so he borrowed the pencil of the person next to him in order
to take notes while Lenard talked.</p>
<p>Planck was in the chair, and by both his commanding presence and
soothing words he was able to prevent any personal attacks. Lenard’s
objections to relativity were similar to those of many nontheorists. The
theory was built on equations rather than observations, he said, and it
“offends against the simple common sense of a scientist.” Einstein
replied that what “seems obvious” changes over time. That was true even
of Galileo’s mechanics.</p>
<p>It was the first time that Einstein and Lenard had met, but they did
not shake hands or speak to each other. And though the official minutes
of the meeting do not record it, Einstein apparently lost his equanimity
at one point. “Einstein was provoked into making a caustic reply,” Born
recalled. And a few weeks later, Einstein wrote Born to assure him that
he would “not allow myself to get excited again as in Nauheim.”23</p>
<p>Finally, Planck was able to end the session, before any blood was
drawn, with a limp joke. “Since the theory of relativity unfortunately
has not so far been able to extend the absolute time available for this
meeting,” he said, “ it must now be adjourned.”The papers the next day
were left without headlines, and the antirelativity movement subsided
for the time being.24</p>
<p>As for Lenard, he distanced himself from the weird group of original
antirelativists. “Unfortunately Weyland turned out to be a crook,” he
later said. But he did not let go of his own antipathy toward Einstein.
After the Bad Nauheim meeting he became increasingly vitriolic and
anti-Semitic in his attacks on Einstein and “Jewish science.” He became
a proponent of creating a “Deutsche Physik” that purged German physics
of Jewish influences, which to him was exemplified by Einstein’s
relativity theory with its abstract, theoretical, and nonexperimental
approach and its odor (at least to him) of a relativism that rejected
absolutes, order, and certainties.</p>
<p>A few months later, at the beginning of January 1921, an obscure
Munich party functionary picked up the theme. “Science, once our
greatest pride, is today being taught by Hebrews,” Adolf Hitler wrote in
a newspaper polemic.25 There were even ripples that made it across the
Atlantic. That April, the Dearborn Independent, a weekly owned by
automaker Henry Ford, a strong anti-Semite, blared a banner headline
across the top of its front page. “Is Einstein a Plagiarist?” it
accusingly asked.26</p>
<p>Einstein in America, 1921</p>
<p>Albert Einstein’s exploding global fame and budding Zionism came
together in the spring of 1921 for an event that was unique in the
history of science, and indeed remarkable for any realm: a grand
two-month processional through the eastern and midwestern United States
that evoked the sort of mass frenzy and press adulation that would
thrill a touring rock star. The world had never before seen, and perhaps
never will again, such a scientific celebrity superstar, one who also
happened to be a gentle icon of humanist values and a living patron
saint for Jews.</p>
<p>Einstein had initially thought that his first visit to America might
be a way to make some money in a stable currency in order to provide for
his family in Switzerland. “I have demanded 5,000 from Princeton and
Wisconsin,” he told Ehrenfest.“It will probably scare them off. But if
they do bite, I will be buying economic independence for myself—and
that’s not a thing to sniff at.”</p>
<p>The American universities did not bite. “My demands were too high,”
he reported back to Ehrenfest.27 So by February 1921, he had made other
plans for the spring: he would present a paper at the third Solvay
Conference in Brussels and give some lectures in Leiden at the behest of
Ehrenfest.</p>
<p>It was then that Kurt Blumenfeld, leader of the Zionist movement in
Germany, came by Einstein’s apartment once again. Exactly two years
earlier, Blumenfeld had visited Einstein and enlisted his support for
the cause of creating a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Now he was coming
with an invitation—or perhaps an instruction—in the form of a telegram
from the president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim
Weizmann.</p>
<p>Weizmann was a brilliant biochemist who had emigrated from Russia to
England, where he helped his adopted nation in the First World War by
coming up with a bacterial method for more efficiently manufacturing the
explosive cordite. During that war he worked under former prime minister
Arthur Balfour, who was then first lord of the Admiralty. He
subsequently helped to persuade Balfour, after he became foreign
secretary, to issue the famous 1917 declaration in which Britain pledged
to support “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the
Jewish people.”</p>
<p>Weizmann’s telegram invited Einstein to accompany him on a trip to
America to raise funds to help settle Palestine and, in particular, to
create Hebrew University in Jerusalem. When Blumenfeld read it to him,
Einstein initially balked. He was not an orator, he said, and the role
of simply using his celebrity to draw crowds to the cause was “an
unworthy one.”</p>
<p>Blumenfeld did not argue. Instead, he simply read Weizmann’s telegram
aloud again. “He is the president of our organization,” Blumenfeld said,
“and if you take your conversion to Zionism seriously, then I have the
right to ask you, in Dr. Weizmann’s name, to go with him to the United
States.”</p>
<p>“What you say is right and convincing,” Einstein replied, to the
“boundless astonishment” of Blumenfeld. “I realize that I myself am now
part of the situation and that I must accept the invitation.”28</p>
<p>Einstein’s reply was indeed a cause for astonishment. He was already
committed to the Solvay Conference and other lectures in Europe, he
professed to dislike the public spotlight, and his fragile stomach had
made him reluctant to travel. He was not a faithful Jew, and his allergy
to nationalism kept him from being a pure and unalloyed Zionist.</p>
<p>Yet now he was doing something that went against his nature:
accepting an implied command from a figure of authority, one that was
based on his perceived bonds and commitments to other people. Why?</p>
<p>Einstein’s decision reflected a major transformation in his life.
Until the completion and confirmation of his general theory of
relativity, he had dedicated himself almost totally to science, to the
exclusion even of his personal, familial, and societal relationships.
But his time in Berlin had made him increasingly aware of his identity
as a Jew. His reaction to the pervasive anti-Semitism was to feel even
more connected—indeed, inextricably connected—to the culture and
community of his people.</p>
<p>Thus in 1921, he made a leap not of faith but of commitment. “I am
really doing whatever I can for the brothers of my race who are treated
so badly everywhere,” he wrote Maurice Solovine.29 Next to his science,
this would become his most important defining connection. As he would
note near the end of his life, after declining the presidency of Israel,
“My relationship to the Jewish people has become my strongest human
tie.”30</p>
<p>One person who was not only astonished but dismayed by Einstein’s
decision was his friend and colleague in Berlin, the chemist Fritz
Haber, who had converted from Judaism and assiduously assimilated in
order to appear a proper Prussian. Like other assimilationists, he was
worried (understandably) that a visit by Einstein to the great wartime
enemy at the behest of a Zionist organization would reinforce the belief
that Jews had dual loyalties and were not good Germans.</p>
<p>In addition, Haber had been thrilled that Einstein was planning to
attend the Solvay Conference in Brussels, the first since the war. No
other Germans had been invited, and his attendance was seen as a crucial
step for the return of Germany to the larger scientific community.</p>
<p>“People in this country will see this as evidence of the disloyalty
of the Jews,” Haber wrote when he heard of Einstein’s decision to visit
America. “You will certainly sacrifice the narrow basis upon which the
existence of professors and students of the Jewish faith at German
universities rests.”31</p>
<p>Haber apparently had the letter delivered by hand, and Einstein
replied the same day. He took issue with Haber’s way of regarding Jews
as being people “of the Jewish faith” and instead, once again, cast the
identity as being inextricably a matter of ethnic kinship. “Despite my
emphatic internationalist beliefs, I have always felt an obligation to
stand up for my persecuted and morally oppressed tribal companions,” he
said. “The prospect of establishing a Jewish university fills me with
particular joy, having recently seen countless instances of perfidious
and uncharitable treatment of splendid young Jews with attempts to deny
their chances of education.”32</p>
<p>And so it was that the Einsteins sailed from Holland on March 21,
1921, for their first visit to America. To keep things unpretentious and
inexpensive, Einstein had said he was willing to travel steerage. The
request was not granted, and he was given a nice stateroom. He also
asked that he and Elsa be given separate rooms, both aboard the ship and
at the hotels, so that he could work while on the trip. That request was
granted.</p>
<p>It was, by all accounts, a pleasant Atlantic crossing, during which
Einstein tried to explain relativity to Weizmann. Asked upon their
arrival whether he understood the theory, Weizmann gave a delightful
reply: “During the crossing, Einstein explained his theory to me every
day, and by the time we arrived I was fully convinced that he really
understands it.”33</p>
<p>When the ship pulled up to the Battery in lower Manhattan on the
afternoon of April 2, Einstein was standing on the deck wearing a faded
gray wool coat and a black felt hat that concealed some but not all of
his now graying shock of hair. In one hand was a shiny briar pipe; the
other clutched a worn violin case. “He looked like an artist,” the New
York Times reported. “But underneath his shaggy locks was a scientific
mind whose deductions have staggered the ablest intellects of
Europe.”34</p>
<p>As soon as they were permitted, dozens of reporters and cameramen
rushed aboard. The press officer of the Zionist organization told
Einstein that he would have to attend a press conference. “I can’t do
that,” he protested. “It’s like undressing in public.”35 But he could,
of course, and did.</p>
<p>First he obediently followed directions for almost a half hour as the
photographers and newsreel men ordered him and Elsa to strike a variety
of poses. Then, in the captain’s cabin, he displayed more joy than
reluctance as he conducted his first press briefing with all the wit and
charm of a merry big-city mayor. “One could tell from his chuckling,”
the reporter from the Philadelphia Public Ledger wrote, “that he enjoyed
it.”36 His questioners enjoyed it as well. The whole performance,
sprinkled with quips and pithy answers, showed why Einstein was destined
to become such a wildly popular celebrity.</p>
<p>Speaking through an interpreter, Einstein began with a statement
about his hope “to secure the support, both material and moral, of
American Jewry for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.” But the
reporters were more interested in relativity, and the first questioner
requested a one-sentence description of the theory, a request that
Einstein would face at almost every stop on his trip. “All of my life I
have been trying to get it into one book,” he replied, “and he wants me
to get it into one sentence!” Pressed to try, he provided a simple
overview: “It is a theory of space and time as far as physics is
concerned, which leads to a theory of gravitation.”</p>
<p>What about those, especially in Germany, who attacked his theory? “No
one of knowledge opposes my theory,” he answered. “Those physicists who
do oppose the theory are animated by political motives.”</p>
<p>What political motives? “Their attitude is largely due to
antiSemitism,” he replied.</p>
<p>The interpreter finally called the session to a close. “Well, I hope
I have passed my examination,” Einstein concluded with a smile.</p>
<p>As they were leaving, Elsa was asked if she understood relativity.
“Oh, no, although he has explained it to me many times,” she replied.
“But it is not necessary to my happiness.”37</p>
<p>Thousands of spectators, along with the fife and drum corps of the
Jewish Legion, were waiting in Battery Park when the mayor and other
dignitaries brought Einstein ashore on a police tugboat. As
blue-and-white flags were waved, the crowd sang the Star-Spangled Banner
and then the Zionist anthem Hatikvah.</p>
<p>The Einsteins and Weizmanns intended to head directly to the Hotel
Commodore in Midtown. Instead, their motorcade wound through the Jewish
neighborhoods of the Lower East Side late into the evening. “Every car
had its horn, and every horn was put in action,” Weizmann recalled. “We
reached the Commodore at about 11:30, tired, hungry, thirsty and
completely dazed.”38</p>
<p>The following day Einstein entertained a steady procession of
visitors and, with what the Times called “an unusual impression of
geniality,” he even held another press gathering. Why, he was asked, had
he attracted such an unprecedented explosion of public interest? He
professed to being puzzled himself. Perhaps a psychologist could
determine why people who generally did not care for science had taken
such an interest in him. “It seems psycho-pathological,” he said with a
laugh.39</p>
<p>Weizmann and Einstein were officially welcomed later in the week at
City Hall, where ten thousand excited spectators gathered in the park to
hear the speeches. Weizmann got polite applause. But Einstein, who said
nothing, got a “tumultuous greeting” when he was introduced. “As
Dr. Einstein left,” the New York Evening Post reported, “he was lifted
onto the shoulders of his colleagues and into the automobile, which
passed in triumphal procession through a mass of waving banners and a
roar of cheering voices.”40</p>
<p>One of Einstein’s visitors at the Commodore Hotel was a German
immigrant physician named Max Talmey, whose name had been Max Talmud
back when he was a poor student in Munich. This was the family friend
who had first exposed the young Einstein to math and philosophy, and he
was unsure whether the now famous scientist would remember him.</p>
<p>Einstein did. “He had not seen me or corresponded with me for
nineteen years,” Talmey later noted. “Yet as soon as I entered his room
in the hotel, he exclaimed: ‘You distinguish yourself through eternal
youth!’”41 They chatted about their days in Munich and their paths
since. Einstein invited Talmey back various times during the course of
his visit, and before he left even went to Talmey’s apartment to meet
his young daughters.</p>
<p>Even though he spoke in German about abstruse theories or stood
silent as Weizmann tried to cajole money for Jewish settlements in
Palestine, Einstein drew packed crowds wherever he went in New
York.“Every seat in the Metropolitan Opera House, from the pit to the
last row under the roof, was filled, and hundreds stood,” reported the
Times one day. About another lecture that week it likewise reported, “He
spoke in German, but those anxious to see and hear the man who has
contributed a new theory of space and time and motion to scientific
conceptions of the universe filled every seat and stood in the
aisles.”42</p>
<p>After three weeks of lectures and receptions in New York, Einstein
paid a visit to Washington. For reasons fathomable only by those who
live in that capital, the Senate decided to debate the theory of
relativity. Among the leaders asserting that it was incomprehensible
were Pennsylvania Republican Boies Penrose, famous for once uttering
that “public office is the last refuge of a scoundrel,” and Mississippi
Democrat John Sharp Williams, who retired a year later, saying, “I’d
rather be a dog and bay at the moon than stay in the Senate another six
years.”</p>
<p>On the House side of the Capitol, Representative J. J. Kindred of New
York proposed placing an explanation of Einstein’s theories in the
Congressional Record. David Walsh of Massachusetts rose to object. Did
Kindred understand the theory? “I have been earnestly busy with this
theory for three weeks,” he replied, “and am beginning to see some
light.” But what relevance, he was asked, did it have to the business of
Congress? “It may bear upon the legislation of the future as to general
relations with the cosmos.”</p>
<p>Such discourse made it inevitable that, when Einstein went with a
group to the White House on April 25, President Warren G. Harding would
be faced with the question of whether he understood relativity. As the
group posed for cameras, President Harding smiled and confessed that he
did not comprehend the theory at all. The Washington Post carried a
cartoon showing him puzzling over a paper titled “Theory of Relativity”
while Einstein puzzled over one on the “Theory of Normalcy,” which was
the name Harding gave to his governing philosophy . The New York Times
ran a page 1 headline: “Einstein Idea Puzzles Harding, He Admits.”</p>
<p>At a reception in the National Academy of Sciences on Constitution
Avenue (which now boasts the world’s most interesting statue of
Einstein, a twelve-foot-high full-length bronze figure of him
reclining),43 he listened to long speeches from various honorees,
including Prince Albert I of Monaco, who was an avid oceanographer, a
North Carolina scholar of hookworms, and a man who had invented a solar
stove. As the evening droned on, Einstein turned to a Dutch diplomat
seated next to him and said, “I’ve just developed a new theory of
eternity.”44</p>
<p>By the time Einstein reached Chicago, where he gave three lectures
and played violin at a dinner party, he had become more adept at
answering irksome questions, particularly the most frequent one, which
was sparked by the fanciful New York Times headline after the 1919
eclipse that only twelve people could understand his theory.</p>
<p>“Is it true only twelve great minds can understand your theory?” the
reporter from the Chicago Herald and Examiner asked.</p>
<p>“No, no,” Einstein replied with a smile. “I think the majority of
scientists who have studied it can understand it.”</p>
<p>He then proceeded to try to explain it to the reporter by using his
metaphor about how the universe would look to a two-dimensional creature
who spent its life moving on a surface of what turned out to be a globe.
“It could travel for millions of years and would always return to its
starting point,” said Einstein. “It would never be conscious of what was
above it or beneath it.”</p>
<p>The reporter, being a good Chicago newspaperman, was able to spin a
glorious tale, written in the third person, about the depths of his own
confusion. “When the reporter came to he was vainly trying to light a
three-dimensional cigarette with a three-dimensional match,” the story
concluded. “It began to trickle into his brain that the two-dimensional
organism referred to was himself, and far from being the 13th Great Mind
to comprehend the theory he was condemned henceforth to be one of the
Vast Majority who live on Main Street and ride in Fords.”45</p>
<p>When a reporter from the rival Tribune asked him the same question
about only twelve people being able to understand his theory, Einstein
again denied it. “Everywhere I go, someone asks me that question,” he
said. “It’s absurd. Anyone who has had sufficient training in science
can readily understand the theory.” But this time Einstein made no
attempt to explain it, nor did the reporter. “The Tribune regrets to
inform its readers that it will be unable to present to them Einstein’s
theory of relativity,” the article began. “After the professor explained
that the most incidental discussion of the question would take from
three to four hours, it was decided to confine the interview to other
things.”46</p>
<p>Einstein went on to Princeton, where he delivered a weeklong series
of scientific lectures and received an honorary degree “for voyaging
through strange seas of thought.” Not only did he get a nice fee for the
lectures (though apparently not the 5,000 he had originally sought), he
also negotiated a deal while there that Princeton could publish his
lectures as a book from which he would get a 15 percent royalty.47</p>
<p>At the behest of Princeton’s president, all of Einstein’s lectures
were very technical. They included more than 125 complex equations that
he scribbled on the blackboard while speaking in German. As one student
admitted to a reporter, “I sat in the balcony, but he talked right over
my head anyway.”48</p>
<p>At a party following one of these lectures, Einstein uttered one of
his most memorable and self-revealing quotes. Someone excitedly informed
him that word had just arrived of a new set of experiments improving on
the Michelson-Morley technique that seemed to show that the ether
existed and the speed of light was variable. Einstein simply refused to
accept it. He knew that his theory was correct. And so he calmly
responded, “Subtle is the Lord, but malicious he is not.”*</p>
<p>The mathematics professor Oswald Veblen, who was standing there,
heard the remark and, when a new math building was built a decade later,
asked Einstein for the right to carve the words on the stone mantel of
the fireplace in the common room. Einstein happily sent back his
approval and further explained to Veblen what he had meant: “Nature
hides her secret because of her essential loftiness, but not by means of
ruse.”49</p>
<p>The building, neatly enough, later became the temporary home of the
Institute for Advanced Study, and Einstein would have an office there
when he immigrated to Princeton in 1933. Near the end of his life, he
was in front of the fireplace at a retirement party for the
mathematician Hermann Weyl, a friend who had followed him from Germany
to Princeton when the Nazis took power. Alluding to his frustration with
the uncertainties of quantum mechanics, Einstein nodded to the quote and
lamented to Weyl, “Who knows, perhaps He is a little malicious.”50</p>
<p>Einstein seemed to like Princeton. “Young and fresh,” he called it.
“A pipe as yet unsmoked.”51 For a man who was invariably fondling new
briar pipes, this was a compliment. It would not be a surprise, a dozen
years hence, that he would decide to move there permanently.</p>
<p>Harvard, where Einstein went next, did not endear itself quite as
well. Perhaps it was because Princeton President John Hibben had
introduced him in German, whereas Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell
spoke to him in French. In addition, Harvard had invited Einstein to
visit, but it did not invite him to give lectures.</p>
<p>Some charged that this slight was due to the influence of a rival
Zionist group in America led by Louis Brandeis, a graduate of Harvard
Law School, who had become the first Jewish Supreme Court justice. The
allegation was so widespread that Brandeis’s protégé Felix Frankfurter
had to issue a public denial. That prompted an amused letter about the
perils of assimilationism from Einstein to Frankfurter. It was “a Jewish
weakness,” he wrote, “always and eagerly to try to keep the Gentiles in
good humor.”52</p>
<p>The very assimilated Brandeis, who had been born in Kentucky and had
turned himself into a proper Bostonian, was an example of the Jews from
Germany whose families had arrived in the nineteenth century and tended
to look down on the more recent immigrants from eastern Europe and
Russia. For both political and personal reasons, Brandeis had clashed
with Weizmann, a Russian Jew who had a more assertive and political
approach toward Zionism.53 The enthusiastic crowds that greeted Einstein
and Weizmann on their trip were mainly made up of the eastern European
Jews, while Brandeis and his ilk remained more aloof.</p>
<p>Most of Einstein’s time during the two days he spent in Boston was
devoted to appearances, rallies, and dinners (including a kosher banquet
for five hundred) with Weizmann to drum up contributions for their
Zionist cause. The Boston Herald reported on the reaction at one
fund-raising event at a synagogue in Roxbury:</p>
<p>The response was electrifying. Young girl ushers worked their way
with difficulty through the crowded aisles, carrying long boxes. Bills
of various denominations were rained into these receptacles. A prominent
Jewess cried out ecstatically that she had eight sons who had been in
the army and wanted to make some donation in proportion to their
sacrifices. She held up her watch, a valuable imported timepiece, and
slipped the rings from her hands. Others followed her example, and soon
baskets and boxes filled with diamonds and other precious
ornaments.54</p>
<p>While in Boston, Einstein was subjected to a pop quiz known as the
Edison test. The inventor Thomas Edison was a practical man, getting
crankier with age (he was then 74), who disparaged American colleges as
too theoretical and felt the same about Einstein. He had devised a test
he gave job applicants that, depending on the position being sought,
included about 150 factual questions. How is leather tanned? What
country consumes the most tea? What was Gutenberg’s type made of?*</p>
<p>The Times called it “the ever-present Edison questionnaire
controversy,” and of course Einstein ran into it. A reporter asked him a
question from the test. “What is the speed of sound?” If anyone
understood the propagation of sound waves, it was Einstein. But he
admitted that he did not “carry such information in my mind since it is
readily available in books.” Then he made a larger point designed to
disparage Edison’s view of education. “The value of a college education
is not the learning of many facts but the training of the mind to
think,” he said.55</p>
<p>One remarkable feature of most stops on Einstein’s grand tour was a
noisy parade, which was rather unusual for a theoretical physicist. In
Hartford, Connecticut, for example, the procession included more than a
hundred automobiles headed by a band, a coterie of war veterans, and
standard-bearers with the American and Zionist flags. More than fifteen
thousand spectators lined the route. “North Main Street was jammed by
crowds that struggled to get close to shake hands,” the newspaper
reported. “The crowds cheered wildly as Dr. Weizmann and Prof. Einstein
stood up in the car to receive flowers.”56</p>
<p>It was an astonishing scene, but it was exceeded in Cleveland.
Several thousands thronged Union train depot to meet the visiting
delegation, and the parade included two hundred honking and flag-draped
cars. Einstein and Weizmann rode in an open car, preceded by a National
Guard marching band and a cadre of Jewish war veterans in uniform.
Admirers along the way grabbed on to Einstein’s car and jumped on the
running board, while police tried to pull them away.57</p>
<p>While in Cleveland, Einstein spoke at the Case School of Applied
Science (now Case Western Reserve), where the famous Michelson-Morley
experiments had been conducted. There he met privately, for more than an
hour, with Professor Dayton Miller, whose new version of that experiment
had provoked Einstein’s skeptical response at the Princeton cocktail
party. Einstein drew sketches of Miller’s ether-drift models and urged
him to continue refining his experiments. Miller remained dubious about
relativity and partial to the ether, but other experiments eventually
affirmed Einstein’s faith that the Lord was indeed more subtle than
malicious.58</p>
<p>The excitement, public outpouring, and dizzying superstar status
conferred upon Einstein were unprecedented. But in financial terms, the
tour was only a modest success for the Zionist movement. The poorer Jews
and recent immigrants had poured out to see him and donated with
enthusiasm. But few of the eminent and old-line Jews with great personal
fortunes became part of the frenzy. They were, on the whole, more
assimilated and less ardently Zionist. Weizmann had hoped to raise at
least million. By the end of the year, only 50,000 had actually been
collected.59</p>
<p>Even after his trip to America, Einstein did not become a
full-fledged member of the Zionist movement. He supported the general
idea of Jewish settlements in Palestine, and especially Hebrew
University in Jerusalem, but he never had a desire to relocate there
himself nor to press for the creation of a Jewish nation-state. Instead,
his connection was more visceral. He came to feel even more associated
with the Jewish people, and he resented even more those who would
forsake their roots in order to assimilate.</p>
<p>In this regard, he was part of a momentous trend that was reshaping
Jewish identity, by choice and by imposition, in Europe. “Until a
generation ago, Jews in Germany did not consider themselves as members
of the Jewish people,” he told a reporter on the day he was leaving
America. “They merely considered themselves as members of a religious
community.” But anti-Semitism changed that, and there was a silver
lining to that cloud, he thought. “The undignified mania of trying to
adapt and conform and assimilate, which happens among many of my social
standing, has always been very repulsive to me,” he said.60</p>
<p>The Bad German</p>
<p>Einstein’s trip to America indelibly cast him as he wanted to be: a
citizen of the world, an internationalist, not a German. That image was
reinforced by his trips to Germany’s other two Great War enemies. On a
visit to England, he spoke at the Royal Society and laid flowers on the
grave of Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey. In France, he charmed the
public by lecturing in French and taking a mournful tour of the graves
on the famous battlefields.</p>
<p>It was also a time of reconciliation with his family. That summer of
1921, he vacationed on the Baltic with his two boys, instilled in young
Eduard a love of math, and then took Hans Albert to Florence. They had
such a pleasant time that it helped further restore his relations with
Mari. “I’m grateful that you’ve raised them to have a friendly regard
for me,” he wrote her. “In fact you’ve done an exemplary job all
around.” Most astonishingly, on his way home from Italy he visited
Zurich and not only called on Mari but even considered staying in “the
little upstairs room,” as he called it, at her house there. They all got
together with the Hurwitz family and had a musical evening as in the old
days.61</p>
<p>But the mood was soon sullied by the continued collapse of the German
mark, which made it harder for Einstein to support a family whose
consumption was in Swiss currency. Before the war the mark had been
worth 24 cents, but it had fallen to 2 cents by the beginning of 1920.
At that time a mark could buy a loaf of bread. But then the bottom fell
out of the currency. By the beginning of 1923, the price of a loaf went
to 700 marks and by the end of that year cost 1 billion marks. Yes, 1
billion. In November 1923, a new currency, the Rentenmark, was
introduced, backed by the government property; 1 trillion old marks
equaled 1 new Rentenmark.</p>
<p>The German people increasingly cast around for scapegoats. They
blamed internationalists and pacifists who had forced a surrender in the
war. They blamed the French and English for imposing what was in fact an
onerous peace. And, no surprise, they blamed the Jews. So Germany in the
1920s was not a good place or time to be an internationalist, pacifist,
intellectual Jew.</p>
<p>The milestone that marked the passage of German anti-Semitism from
being a nasty undercurrent to a public danger was the assassination of
Walther Rathenau. From a wealthy Jewish family in Berlin (his father
founded AEG, an electricity firm that competed with that of Einstein’s
father and then became a huge corporation), he served as a senior
official in the war ministry, then reconstruction minister and finally
foreign minister.</p>
<p>Einstein had read Rathenau’s politics book in 1917, and over dinner
told him, “I saw with astonishment and joy how extensive a meeting of
minds there is between our outlooks on life.” Rathenau returned the
compliment by reading Einstein’s popular explanation of relativity. “I
do not say it comes easily to me, but certainly relatively easily,” he
joked. Then he peppered Einstein with some very insightful questions:
“How does a gyroscope know that it is rotating? How does it distinguish
the direction in space toward which it does not want to be
tilted?”62</p>
<p>Although they became close friends, there was one issue that divided
them. Rathenau opposed Zionism and thought, mistakenly, that Jews like
himself could reduce anti-Semitism by thoroughly assimilating as good
Germans.</p>
<p>In the hope that Rathenau could warm to the Zionist cause, Einstein
introduced him to Weizmann and Blumenfeld. They met for discussions,
both at Einstein’s apartment and at Rathenau’s grand manor in Berlin’s
Grunewald, but Rathenau remained unmoved.63 The best course, he thought,
was for Jews to take public roles and become part of Germany’s power
structure.</p>
<p>Blumenfeld argued that it was wrong for a Jew to presume to run the
foreign affairs of another people, but Rathenau kept insisting that he
was a German. It was an attitude that was “all too typical of
assimilated German Jews,” said Weizmann, who was contemptuous of German
Jews who tried to assimilate, and especially of those courtiers who
became what he dismissed as Kaiserjuden. “They seemed to have no idea
that they were sitting on a volcano.”64</p>
<p>As foreign minister in 1922, Rathenau supported German compliance
with the Treaty of Versailles and negotiated the Treaty of Rappallo with
the Soviet Union, which caused him to be among the first to be labeled
by the fledgling Nazi Party as a member of a Jewish-communist
conspiracy. On the morning of June 24, 1922, some young nationalists
pulled alongside the open car in which Rathenau was riding to work,
sprayed him with machine-gun fire, lobbed in a hand grenade, and then
sped away.</p>
<p>Einstein was devastated by the brutal assassination, and most of
Germany mourned. Schools, universities, and theaters were closed out of
respect on the day of his funeral. A million people, Einstein included,
paid tribute in front of the Parliament building.</p>
<p>But not everyone felt sympathy. Adolf Hitler called the killers
German heroes. Likewise, at the University of Heidelberg, Einstein’s
antagonist Philipp Lenard decided to defy the day of mourning and give
his regular lecture. A number of students showed up to cheer him, but a
group of passing workers were so enraged that they dragged the professor
from the class and were about to drop him in the Neckar River when
police intervened.65</p>
<p>For Einstein, the assassination of Rathenau provided a bitter lesson:
assimilation did not bring safety. “I regretted the fact that he became
a government minister,” Einstein wrote in a tribute he sent to a German
magazine. “In view of the attitude that large numbers of educated
Germans have towards Jews, I have always thought that the proper conduct
of the Jews in public life should be one of proud reserve.”66</p>
<p>Police warned Einstein that he might be next. His name appeared on
the target lists prepared by Nazi sympathizers. He should leave Berlin,
officials said, or at least avoid any public lectures.</p>
<p>Einstein moved temporarily to Kiel, took a leave of absence from his
teaching duties, and wrote to Planck, backing out of the speech he was
scheduled to give to the annual convention of German scientists. Lenard
and Gehrcke had led a group of nineteen scientists who published a
“Declaration of Protest” aimed at barring him from that convention, and
Einstein realized that his fame had come back to haunt him. “The
newspapers have mentioned my name too often, thus mobilizing the rabble
against me,” he explained in his note of apology to Planck.67</p>
<p>The months after Rathenau’s assassination were “nerve-wracking,”
Einstein lamented to his friend Maurice Solovine. “I am always on the
alert.”68 To Marie Curie he confided that he would probably quit his
positions in Berlin and find someplace else to live. She urged him to
stay and fight instead: “I think that your friend Rathenau would have
encouraged you to make an effort.”69</p>
<p>One option he considered briefly was a move to Kiel, on Germany’s
Baltic coast, to work at an engineering firm there run by a friend. He
had already developed for the firm a new design for a navigational
gyroscope, which it patented in 1922 and for which he was paid 20,000
marks in cash.</p>
<p>The firm’s owner was surprised but thrilled when Einstein suggested
that he might be willing to move there, buy a villa, and become an
engineer rather than a theoretical physicist. “The prospect of a
downright normal human existence in quietude, combined with the welcome
chance of practical work in the factory, delights me,” Einstein said.
“Plus the wonderful scenery, sailing—enviable!”</p>
<p>But he quickly abandoned the idea, blaming it on Elsa’s “horror” of
any change. Elsa, for her part, pointed out, no doubt correctly, that it
was really Einstein’s own decision.“This business of quietude is an
illusion,” she wrote.70</p>
<p>Why didn’t he leave Berlin? He had lived there for eight years,
longer than anywhere since running away from Munich as a schoolboy.
Anti-Semitism was rising, the economy collapsing, and Kiel was certainly
not his only option. The light from his star was causing his friends in
both Leiden and Zurich to try repeatedly to recruit him with lucrative
job offers.</p>
<p>His inertia is hard to explain, but it is indicative of a change that
became evident in both his personal life and his scientific work during
the 1920s. He had once been a restless rebel who hopped from job to job,
insight to insight, resisting anything that smacked of restraint. He had
been repelled by conventional respectability. But now he personified it.
From being a romantic youth who fancied himself a footloose bohemian he
had settled, with but a few stabs at ironic detachment, into a bourgeois
life with a doting hausfrau and a richly wallpapered home filled with
heavy Biedermeier furniture. He was no longer restless. He was
comfortable.</p>
<p>Despite his qualms about publicity and resolve to lie low, it was not
in Einstein’s nature to shy away from saying what he thought. Nor was he
always able to resist demands that he play a public role. Thus he showed
up at a huge pacifist rally in a Berlin public park on August 1, just
five weeks after Rathenau’s assassination. Although he did not speak, he
agreed to be paraded around the rally in a car.71</p>
<p>Earlier that year, he had joined the League of Nations’ International
Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, which sought to promote a
pacifist spirit among scholars, and he had persuaded Marie Curie to join
as well. Its name and mission was sure to inflame German nationalists.
So in the wake of the Rathenau assassination, Einstein declared that he
wished to resign. “The situation here is that a Jew would do well to
exercise restraint as regards his participation in political affairs,”
he wrote a League official. “In addition, I must say that I have no
desire to represent people who would certainly not choose me as their
representative.”72</p>
<p>Even that small act of public reticence did not hold. Curie and the
Oxford professor Gilbert Murray, a leader of the committee, begged him
to stay a member, and Einstein promptly withdrew his resignation. For
the next two years, he remained peripherally involved, but eventually he
broke with the League, partly because it supported France’s seizure of
the Ruhr region after Germany was unable to make reparation
payments.</p>
<p>He treated the League, as he did so many parts of life, with a
slightly detached and amused air. Each member was supposed to give an
address to Geneva University students, but Einstein gave a violin
recital instead. One evening at a dinner, Murray’s wife asked him why he
remained so cheerful given the depravity of the world. “We must remember
that this is a very small star,” he responded, “and probably some of the
larger and more important stars may be very virtuous and happy.”73</p>
<p>Asia and Palestine, 1922–1923</p>
<p>The unpleasant atmosphere in Germany made Einstein willing to take
the most extensive tour of his life, a six-month excursion beginning in
October 1922 that would be the only time he would travel either to Asia
or what is now Israel. Wherever he went, he was treated as a celebrity,
arousing within him the usual mixed emotions. Upon arrival in Ceylon,
the Einsteins were whisked away by a waiting rickshaw.“We rode in small
one-man carriages drawn at a trot by men of Herculean strength yet
delicate build,” he noted in his travel diary. “I was bitterly ashamed
to share responsibility for the abominable treatment accorded fellow
human beings but was unable to do anything about it.”74</p>
<p>In Singapore, almost the entire Jewish community of more than six
hundred turned up at the dock, fortunately trailing no rickshaws.
Einstein’s target was the richest of them all, Sir Menasseh Meyer, who
was born in Baghdad and made his fortune in the opium and real estate
markets. “Our sons are refused admission to the universities of other
nations,” he declared in his speech seeking donations for Hebrew
University. Not many of his listeners understood German, and Einstein
called the event a “desperate calamity of language with good tasting
cake.” But it paid off. Meyer gave a sizable donation.75</p>
<p>Einstein’s own take was even greater. His Japanese publisher and
hosts paid him 2,000 pounds for his lecture series there. It was a huge
success. Close to twenty-five hundred paying customers showed up for the
first talk in Tokyo, which lasted four hours with translation, and more
thronged the Imperial Palace to watch his arrival there to meet the
emperor and empress.</p>
<p>Einstein was typically amused by it all. “No living person deserves
this sort of reception,” he told Elsa as they stood on the balcony of
their hotel room at dawn listening to the cheers of a thousand people
who had kept an all-night vigil hoping to glimpse him. “I’m afraid we’re
swindlers. We’ll end up in prison yet.” The German ambassador, with a
bit of edge to his pen, reported that “the entire journey of the famous
man has been mounted and executed as a commercial enterprise.”76</p>
<p>Feeling sorry for his listeners, Einstein shortened his subsequent
lecture to under three hours. But as he rode to the next city by train
(passing along the way through Hiroshima), he could sense that something
was amiss with his hosts. Upon asking what the problem was, he was
politely told, “The persons who arranged the second lecture were
insulted because it did not last four hours like the first one.”
Thenceforth, he lectured long to the patient Japanese audiences.</p>
<p>The Japanese people struck him as gentle and unpretentious, with a
deep appreciation for beauty and ideas. “Of all the people I have met, I
like the Japanese most, as they are modest, intelligent, considerate,
and have a feel for art,” he wrote his two sons.77</p>
<p>On his voyage back west, Einstein made his only visit to Palestine, a
memorable twelve-day stay that included stops in Lod, Tel Aviv,
Jerusalem, and Haifa. He was greeted with great British pomp, as if he
were a head of state rather than a theoretical physicist. A cannon
salute announced his arrival at the palatial residence of the British
high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel.</p>
<p>Einstein, on the other hand, was typically unpretentious; he and Elsa
arrived tired because he had insisted that they travel in the
coach-class car of the overnight train from the coast rather than the
first-class sleeping car that had been prepared for them. Elsa was so
unnerved by the British formality that she went to bed early some nights
to avoid ceremonial events. “When my husband commits a breach of
etiquette, it is said it’s because he’s a man of genius,” she
complained. “In my case, however, it is attributed to lack of
culture.”78</p>
<p>Like Lord Haldane, Commissioner Samuel was a serious amateur in
philosophy and science. Together he and Einstein walked the Old City of
Jerusalem to that holiest shrine for religious Jews, the Western Wall
(or Wailing Wall) that flanks Temple Mount. But Einstein’s deepening
love for his Jewish heritage did not instill any new appreciation for
the Jewish religion. “Dull-minded tribal companions are praying, faces
turned to the wall, rocking their bodies forward and back,” he recorded
in his diary. “A pitiful sight of men with a past but without a
future.”79</p>
<p>The sights of industrious Jewish people building a new land evinced a
more positive reaction. One day he went to a reception for a Zionist
organization, and the gates of the building were stormed by throngs who
wanted to hear him.“I consider this the greatest day of my life,”
Einstein proclaimed in the excitement of the moment. “Before, I have
always found something to regret in the Jewish soul, and that is the
forgetfulness of its own people. Today, I have been made happy by the
sight of the Jewish people learning to recognize themselves and to make
themselves recognized as a force in the world.”</p>
<p>The most frequent question Einstein was asked was whether he would
someday return to Jerusalem to stay. He was unusually discreet in his
replies, saying nothing quotable. But he knew, as he confided to one of
his hosts, that if he came back he would be “an ornament” with no chance
of peace or privacy. As he noted in his diary, “My heart says yes, but
my reason says no.”80</p>
