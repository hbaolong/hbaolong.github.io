ONE-WORLDER</h4>
<p>1945–1948</p>
<p>Portrait by Philippe Halsman, 1947</p>
<p>Arms Control</p>
<p>For a few weeks after the dropping of the atom bomb, Einstein was
uncharacteristically reticent. He fended off reporters who were knocking
at his door in Saranac Lake, and he even declined to give a quote to his
summer neighbor Arthur Hays Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times,
when he called.1</p>
<p>It was only as he was about to leave his summer rental in
mid-September, more than a month after the bombs had been dropped, that
Einstein agreed to discuss the issue with a wire service reporter who
came calling. The point he stressed was that the bomb reinforced his
longtime support for world federalism. “The only salvation for
civilization and the human race lies in the creation of world
government,” he said. “As long as sovereign states continue to have
armaments and armaments secrets, new world wars will be
inevitable.”2</p>
<p>As in science, so it was in world politics for Einstein: he sought a
unified set of principles that could create order out of anarchy. A
system based on sovereign nations with their own military forces,
competing ideologies, and conflicting national interests would
inevitably produce more wars. So he regarded a world authority as
realistic rather than idealistic, as practical rather than naïve.</p>
<p>He had been circumspect during the war years. He was a refugee in a
nation that was using its military might for noble rather than
nationalistic goals. But the end of the war changed things. So did the
dropping of the atom bombs. The increase in the destructive power of
offensive weaponry led to a commensurate increase in the need to find a
world structure for security. It was time for him to become politically
outspoken again.</p>
<p>For the remaining ten years of his life, his passion for advocating a
unified governing structure for the globe would rival that for finding a
unified field theory that could govern all the forces of nature.
Although distinct in most ways, both quests reflected his instincts for
transcendent order. In addition, both would display Einstein’s
willingness to be a nonconformist, to be serenely secure in challenging
prevailing attitudes.</p>
<p>The month after the bombs were dropped, a group of scientists signed
a statement urging that a council of nations be created to control
atomic weaponry. Einstein responded with a letter to J. Robert
Oppenheimer, who had so successfully led the scientific efforts at Los
Alamos. He was pleased with the sentiments behind the statement,
Einstein said, but he criticized the political recommendations as
“obviously inadequate” because they retained sovereign nations as the
ultimate powers. “It is unthinkable that we can have peace without a
real governmental organization to create and enforce law on individuals
in their international relations.”</p>
<p>Oppenheimer politely pointed out that “the statements you attributed
to me are not mine.” They had been written by another group of
scientists. He did, nevertheless, challenge Einstein’s argument for a
full-fledged world government: “The history of this nation up through
the Civil War shows how difficult the establishment of a federal
authority can be when there are profound differences in the values of
the societies it attempts to integrate.”3 Oppenheimer thus became the
first of many postwar realists to disparage Einstein for being allegedly
too idealistic. Of course, one could flip his argument by noting that
the Civil War showed in gruesome terms the danger of not having a secure
federal authority instead of state military sovereignty when there are
differences of values among member states.</p>
<p>What Einstein envisioned was a world “government” or “authority” that
had a monopoly on military power. He called it a “supranational” entity,
rather than an “international” one, because it would exist above its
member nations rather than as a mediator among sovereign nations.4 The
United Nations, which was founded in October 1945, did not come close to
meeting these criteria, Einstein felt.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, Einstein fleshed out his proposals in a
series of essays and interviews. The most important arose from an
exchange of fan letters he had with Raymond Gram Swing, a commentator on
ABC radio. Einstein invited Swing to visit him in Princeton, and the
result was an article by Einstein, as told to Swing, in the November
1945 issue of the Atlantic called “Atomic War or Peace.”5</p>
<p>The three great powers—the United States, Britain, and Russia—should
jointly establish the new world government, Einstein said in the
article, and then invite other nations to join. Using a somewhat
misleading phrase that was part of the popular debate of the time, he
said that “the secret of the bomb” should be given to this new
organization by Washington.6 The only truly effective way to control
atomic arms, he believed, was by ceding the monopoly on military power
to a world government.</p>
<p>By then, in late 1945, the cold war was under way. America and
Britain had begun to clash with Russia for imposing communist regimes in
Poland and other eastern European areas occupied by the Red Army. For
its part, Russia zealously sought a security perimeter and was neuralgic
about any perceived attempt to interfere in its domestic affairs, which
made its leaders resist surrendering any sovereignty to a world
authority.</p>
<p>So Einstein sought to make it clear that the world government he
envisioned would not try to impose a Western-style liberal democracy
everywhere. He advocated a world legislature that would be elected
directly by the people of each member country, in secret ballot, rather
than appointed by the nation’s rulers. However, “it should not be
necessary to change the internal structure of the three great powers,”
he added as a reassurance to Russia. “Membership in a supranational
security system should not be based on any arbitrary democratic
standards.”</p>
<p>One issue that Einstein could not resolve neatly was what right this
world government would have to intervene in the internal affairs of
nations. It must be able “to interfere in countries where a minority is
oppressing a majority,” he said, citing Spain as an example. Yet that
caused him contortions about whether this standard applied to Russia.
“One must bear in mind that the people in Russia have not had a long
tradition of political education,” he rationalized. “Changes to improve
conditions in Russia had to be effected by a minority because there was
no majority capable of doing so.”</p>
<p>Einstein’s efforts to prevent future wars were motivated not only by
his old pacifist instincts but also, he admitted, by his guilty feelings
about the role he had played in encouraging the atom bomb project. At a
Manhattan dinner given by the Nobel Prize committee in December, he
noted that Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, had created the award
“to atone for having invented the most powerful explosives ever known up
to his time.” He was in a similar situation. “Today, the physicists who
participated in forging the most formidable and dangerous weapon of all
times are harassed by an equal feeling of responsibility, not to say
guilt,” he said.7</p>
<p>These sentiments prompted Einstein, in May 1946, to take on the most
prominent public policy role in his career. He became chairman of the
newly formed Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists, which was
dedicated to nuclear arms control and world government. “The unleashed
power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking,”
Einstein wrote in a fund-raising telegram that month, “and thus we drift
towards unparalleled catastrophe.”8</p>
<p>Leó Szilárd served as the executive director and did most of the
organizational work. But Einstein, who served until the end of 1948,
gave speeches, chaired meetings, and took his role seriously. “Our
generation has brought into the world the most revolutionary force since
prehistoric man’s discovery of fire,” he said. “This basic power of the
universe cannot be fitted into the outmoded concept of narrow
nationalisms.”9</p>
<p>The Truman administration proposed a variety of plans for the
international control of atomic power, but none were able, intentionally
or not, to win the support of Moscow. As a result, the battle over the
best approach quickly created a political divide.</p>
<p>On one side were those who celebrated the success of America and
Britain in winning the race to develop such weapons. They saw the bomb
as a guarantor of the freedoms of the West, and they wanted to guard
what they saw as “the secret.” On the other side were arms control
advocates like Einstein. “The secret of the atomic bomb is to America
what the Maginot Line was to France before 1939,” he told Newsweek. “It
gives us imaginary security, and in this respect it is a great
danger.”10</p>
<p>Einstein and his friends realized that the battle for public
sentiment needed to be fought not only in Washington but also in the
realm of popular culture. This led to an amusing—and historically
illustrative—tangle in 1946 pitting them against Louis B. Mayer and a
coterie of earnest Hollywood moviemakers.</p>
<p>It began when a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer scriptwriter named Sam Marx asked
if he could come to Princeton to get Einstein’s cooperation on a
docudrama about the making of the bomb. Einstein sent back word that he
had no desire to help. A few weeks later Einstein got an anxious letter
from an official with the Association of Manhattan Project Scientists
saying that the movie seemed to be taking a very pro-military slant,
celebrating the creation of the bomb and the security it gave to
America. “I know that you will not want to lend your name to a picture
which misrepresents the military and political implications of the
bomb,” the letter said. “I hope that you will see fit to make the use of
your name conditional on your personal approval of the script.”11</p>
<p>The following week Szilárd came to see Einstein about the issue, and
soon a bevy of peace-loving physicists was bombarding him with concerns.
So Einstein read the script and agreed to join the campaign to stop the
movie. “The presentation of facts was so utterly misleading that I
declined any cooperation or permission of the use of my name,” he
said.</p>
<p>He also sent a spiky letter to the famed mogul that attacked the
proposed movie and also, for good measure, the tone of previous ones
that Mayer had made. “Although I am not much of a moviegoer, I do know
from the tenor of earlier films that have come out of your studio that
you will understand my reasons,” he wrote. “I find that the whole film
is written too much from the point of view of the Army and the Army
leader of the project, whose influence was not always in the direction
which one would desire from the point of view of humanity.”12</p>
<p>Mayer turned Einstein’s letter over to the film’s chief editor, who
responded with a memo that Mayer sent back to Einstein. President
Truman, it said, “was most anxious to have the picture made” and had
personally read and approved the script, an argument not likely to
reassure Einstein. “As American citizens we are bound to respect the
viewpoint of our government.” That, too, was not the best argument to
use on Einstein. There followed an even less persuasive argument: “It
must be realized that dramatic truth is just as compelling a requirement
to us as veritable truth is to a scientist.”</p>
<p>The memo concluded by promising that the moral issues raised by the
scientists would be given a proper airing through the character of a
fictional young scientist played by an actor named Tom Drake. “We
selected among our young male players the one who best typifies
earnestness and a spiritual quality,” it said reassuringly. “You need
only recall his performance in ‘The Green Years.’”13</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, this did not turn Einstein around. When Sam Marx,
the scriptwriter, wrote beseeching him to change his mind and allow
himself to be portrayed, Einstein replied curtly: “I have explained my
point of view in a letter to Mr. Louis Mayer.” Marx was persistent.
“When the picture is complete,” he wrote back, “the audience will feel
in greatest sympathy with the young scientist.” And from later the same
day: “Here is a new and revised script.”14</p>
<p>The ending was not that hard to predict. The new script was more
pleasing to the scientists, and they were not immune to the lure of
being glorified on the big screen. Szilárd sent Einstein a telegram
saying, “Have received new script from MGM and am writing that I have no
objection to use of my name in it.” Einstein relented. “Agree with use
of my name on basis of the new script,” he scribbled in English on the
back of the telegram. The only change he requested was in the scene of
Szilárd’s 1939 visit to him on Long Island. The script said that he had
not met Roosevelt before then, but he had.15</p>
<p>The Beginning or the End, which was the name of the movie, opened to
good reviews in February 1947. “A sober, intelligent account of the
development and deployment of the Atom Bomb,” Bosley Crowther declared
in the New York Times, “refreshingly free of propagandizing.” Einstein
was played by a character actor named Ludwig Stossel, who had a small
part in Casablanca as a German Jew trying to get to America and would
later have a flicker of fame in Swiss Colony wine commercials in the
1960s in which he spoke the tagline “That little old winemaker,
me.”16</p>
<p>Einstein’s efforts on behalf of arms control and his advocacy of
world government in the late 1940s got him tagged as woolly-headed and
naïve. Woolly-headed he may have been, at least in appearance, but was
it right to dismiss him as naïve?</p>
<p>Most Truman administration officials, even those working on behalf of
arms control, thought so. William Golden was an example. An Atomic
Energy Commission staffer who was preparing a report for Secretary of
State George Marshall, he went to Princeton to consult with Einstein.
Washington needed to try harder to enlist Moscow in an arms control
plan, Einstein argued. Golden felt he was speaking “with almost
childlike hope for salvation and without appearing to have thought
through the details of his solution.” He reported back to Marshall, “It
was surprising, though perhaps it should not have been, that, out of his
métier of mathematics, he seemed naïve in the field of international
politics. The man who popularized the concept of a fourth dimension
could think in only two of them in considerations of World
Government.”17</p>
<p>To the extent that Einstein was naïve, it was not because he had a
benign view of human nature. Having lived in Germany in the first half
of the twentieth century, there was little chance of that. When the
famed photographer Philippe Halsman, who had escaped the Nazis with
Einstein’s help, asked whether he thought there would ever be lasting
peace, Einstein answered, “No, as long as there will be man, there will
be war.” At that moment Halsman clicked his shutter and captured
Einstein’s sadly knowing eyes for what became a famous portrait
(reproduced on page 487).18</p>
<p>Einstein’s advocacy of an empowered world authority was based not on
gooey sentiments but on this hardnosed assessment of human nature. “If
the idea of world government is not realistic,” he said in 1948, “then
there is only one realistic view of our future: wholesale destruction of
man by man.”19</p>
<p>Like some of his scientific breakthroughs, Einstein’s approach
involved abandoning entrenched suppositions that others considered
verities. National sovereignty and military autonomy had been an
underpinning of the world order for centuries, just as absolute time and
absolute space had been the underpinning of the cosmic order. To
advocate transcending that approach was a radical idea, the product of a
nonconformist thinker. But like many of Einstein’s ideas that at first
seemed so radical, it may have looked less so had it come to be
accepted.</p>
<p>The world federalism that Einstein—and indeed many sober and
established political leaders—advocated during the early years of
America’s atomic monopoly was not unthinkable. To the extent that he was
naïve, it was because he put forth his idea in a simple fashion and did
not consider complex compromises. Physicists are not used to trimming or
compromising their equations in order to get them accepted. Which is why
they do not make good politicians.</p>
<p>At the end of the 1940s, when it was becoming clear to him that the
effort to control nuclear weaponry would fail, Einstein was asked what
the next war would look like.“I do not know how the Third World War will
be fought,” he answered, “but I can tell you what they will use in the
Fourth—rocks.”20</p>
<p>Russia</p>
<p>Those who wanted international control of the bomb had one big issue
to confront: how to deal with Russia. A growing number of Americans,
along with their elected leaders, came to view Moscow’s communists as
dangerously expansionist and deceitful. The Russians, for their part,
did not seem all that eager for arms control or world governance either.
They had deeply ingrained fears about their security, a desire for a
bomb of their own, and leaders who recoiled at any hint of outside
meddling in their nation’s internal affairs.</p>
<p>There was a typical nonconformity in Einstein’s attitudes toward
Russia. He did not swing as far as many others did toward glorifying the
Russians when they became allies during the war, nor did he swing as far
toward demonizing them when the cold war began. But by the late 1940s,
this put him increasingly outside mainstream American sentiments.</p>
<p>He disliked communist authoritarianism, but he did not see it as an
imminent danger to American liberty. The greater danger, he felt, was
rising hysteria about the supposed Red menace. When Norman Cousins,
editor of the Saturday Review and the journalistic patron of America’s
internationalist intelligentsia, wrote a piece calling for international
arms control, Einstein responded with a fan letter but added a caveat.
“What I object to in your article is that you not only fail to oppose
the widespread hysterical fear in our country of Russian aggression but
actually encourage it,” he said. “All of us should ask ourselves which
of the two countries is objectively more justified in fearing the
aggressive intentions of the other.”21</p>
<p>As for the repression inside Russia, Einstein tended to offer only
mild condemnations diluted by excuses. “It is undeniable that a policy
of severe coercion exists in the political sphere,” he said in one talk.
“This may, in part, be due to the need to break the power of the former
ruling class and to convert a politically inexperienced, culturally
backward people into a nation well organized for productive work. I do
not presume to pass judgment in these difficult matters.”22</p>
<p>Einstein consequently became the target of critics who saw him as a
Soviet sympathizer. Mississippi Congressman John Rankin said that
Einstein’s world government plan was “simply carrying out the Communist
line.” Speaking on the House floor, Rankin also denounced Einstein’s
science: “Ever since he published his book on relativity to try to
convince the world that light had weight, he has capitalized on his
reputation as a scientist . . . and has been engaged in communistic
activities.”23</p>
<p>Einstein continued his long-running exchanges on Russia with Sidney
Hook, the social philosopher who had once been a communist and then
become strongly anticommunist. These were not as exalted as his
exchanges with Bohr, on either side, but they got as intense. “I am not
blind to the serious weakness of the Russian system of government,”
Einstein replied to one of Hook’s missives. “But it has, on the other
side, great merits and it is difficult to decide whether it would have
been possible for the Russians to survive by following softer
methods.”24</p>
<p>Hook took it upon himself to convince Einstein of the error of his
ways and sent him long and rather frequent letters, most of which
Einstein ignored. On the occasions he did answer, Einstein generally
agreed that Russia’s oppression was wrong, but he tended to balance such
judgments by adding that it was also somewhat understandable. As he
juggled it in one 1950 response:</p>
<p>I do not approve of the interference by the Soviet government in
intellectual and artistic matters. Such interference seems to me
objectionable, harmful, and even ridiculous. Regarding the
centralization of political power and the limitations of the freedom of
action for the individual, I think that these restrictions should not
exceed the limit demanded by security, stability, and the necessities
resulting from a planned economy. An outsider is hardly able to judge
the facts and possibilities. In any case it cannot be doubted that the
achievements of the Soviet regime are considerable in the fields of
education, public health, social welfare, and economics, and that the
people as a whole have greatly gained by these achievements.25</p>
<p>Despite these qualified excuses for some of Moscow’s behavior,
Einstein was not the Soviet supporter that some tried to paint him. He
had always rejected invitations to Moscow and rebuffed attempts by
friends on the left to embrace him as a comrade. He denounced Moscow’s
repeated use of the veto at the United Nations and its resistance to the
idea of world government, and he became even more critical when the
Soviets made it clear that they had no appetite for arms control.</p>
<p>This was evident when an official group of Russian scientists
attacked Einstein in a 1947 Moscow newspaper article, “Dr. Einstein’s
Mistaken Notions.” His vision for a world government, they declared, was
a plot by capitalists. “The proponents of a world super-state are asking
us voluntarily to surrender independence for the sake of world
government, which is nothing but a flamboyant signboard for the
supremacy of capitalist monopolies,” they wrote. They denounced Einstein
for recommending a directly elected supranational parliament. “He has
gone so far as to declare that if the Soviet Union refuses to join this
new-fangled organization, other countries would have every right to go
ahead without it. Einstein is supporting a political fad which plays
into the hands of the sworn enemies of sincere international cooperation
and enduring peace.”26</p>
<p>Soviet sympathizers at the time were willing to follow almost any
party line that Moscow dictated. Such conformity was not in Einstein’s
nature. When he disagreed with someone, he merrily said so. He was happy
to take on the Russian scientists.</p>
<p>Although he reiterated his support for democratic socialist ideals,
he rebutted the Russians’ faith in communist dogma. “We should not make
the mistake of blaming capitalism for all existing social and political
evils, nor of assuming that the very establishment of socialism would be
sufficient to cure the social and political ills of humanity,” he wrote.
Such thinking led to the “fanatical intolerance” that infected the
Communist Party faithful, and it opened the way to tyranny.</p>
<p>Despite his criticisms of untrammeled capitalism, what repelled him
more—and had repelled him his entire life—was repression of free thought
and individuality. “Any government is evil if it carries within it the
tendency to deteriorate into tyranny,” he warned the Russian scientists.
“The danger of such deterioration is more acute in a country in which
the government has authority not only over the armed forces but also
over every channel of education and information as well as over the
existence of every single citizen.”27</p>
<p>Just as his dispute with the Russian scientists was breaking,
Einstein was working with Raymond Gram Swing to update the article in
the Atlantic that they had done two years earlier. This time Einstein
attacked Russia’s rulers. Their reasons for not supporting a world
government, he said, “quite obviously are pretexts.”Their real fear was
that their repressive communist command system might not survive in such
an environment. “The Russians may be partly right about the difficulty
of retaining their present social structure in a supranational regime,
though in time they may be brought to see that this is a far lesser loss
than remaining isolated from a world of law.”28</p>
<p>The West should proceed with creating a world government without
Russia, he said. They would eventually come around, he thought: “I
believe that if this were done intelligently (rather than in clumsy
Truman style!) Russia would cooperate once she realized that she was no
longer able to prevent world government anyhow.”29</p>
<p>From then on, Einstein seemed to take a perverse pride in disputing
those who blamed the Russians for everything, and those who blamed them
for nothing. When a left-leaning pacifist he knew sent him a book he had
written on arms control, expecting Einstein’s endorsement, he got
instead a rebuff. “You have presented the whole problem as an advocate
of the Soviet point of view,” Einstein wrote, “but you have kept silent
about everything which is not favorable for the Soviets (and this is not
little).”30</p>
<p>Even his longtime pacifism developed a hard, realistic edge when it
came to dealing with Russia, just as it had after the Nazis rose to
power in Germany. Pacifists liked to think that Einstein’s break with
their philosophy in the 1930s was an aberration caused by the unique
threat posed by the Nazis, and some biographers likewise treat it as a
temporary anomaly.31 But that minimizes the shift in Einstein’s
thinking. He was never again a pure pacifist.</p>
<p>When he was asked, for example, to join a campaign to persuade
American scientists to refuse to work on atomic weapons, he not only
declined but berated the organizers for advocating unilateral
disarmament. “Disarmament cannot be effective unless all countries
participate,” he lectured. “If even one nation continues to arm, openly
or secretly, the disarmament of the others will involve disastrous
consequences.”</p>
<p>Pacifists like himself had made a mistake in the 1920s by encouraging
Germany’s neighbors not to rearm, he explained. “This merely served to
encourage the arrogance of the Germans.” There were parallels now with
Russia. “Similarly, your proposition would, if effective, surely lead to
a serious weakening of the democracies,” he wrote those pushing the
antimilitary petition. “For we must realize that we are probably not
able to exert any significant influence on the attitude of our Russian
colleagues.”32</p>
<p>He took a similar stance when his former colleagues in the War
Resisters’ League asked him to rejoin in 1948. They flattered him by
quoting one of his old pacifist proclamations, but Einstein rebuffed
them. “That statement accurately expresses the views I held on war
resistance in the period from 1918 to the early thirties,” he replied.
“Now, however, I feel that policy, which involves the refusal of
individuals to participate in military activities, is too
primitive.”</p>
<p>Simplistic pacifism could be dangerous, he warned, especially given
the internal policies and external attitude of Russia. “The war
resistance movement actually serves to weaken the nations with a more
liberal type of government and, indirectly, to support the policies of
the existing tyrannical governments,” he argued. “Antimilitaristic
activities, through refusal of military service, are wise only if they
are feasible everywhere throughout the world. Individual antimilitarism
is impossible in Russia.”33</p>
<p>Some pacifists argued that world socialism, rather than world
government, would be the best foundation for lasting peace. Einstein
disagreed. “You say that socialism by its very nature rejects the remedy
of war,” Einstein replied to one such advocate. “I do not believe that.
I can easily imagine that two socialist states might fight a war against
each other.”34</p>
<p>One of the early flashpoints of the cold war was Poland, where the
occupying Red Army had installed a pro-Soviet regime without the open
elections that Moscow had promised. When that new Polish government
invited Einstein to a conference, they got a taste of his independence
from party dogma. He politely explained that he no longer traveled
overseas, and he sent a careful message that offered encouragement but
also stressed his call for a world government.</p>
<p>The Poles decided to delete the parts about world government, which
Moscow opposed. Einstein was furious, and he released his un-delivered
full message to the New York Times. “Mankind can gain protection against
the danger of unimaginable destruction and wanton annihilation only if a
supranational organization has alone the authority to produce or possess
these weapons,” it said. He also complained to the British pacifist who
presided over the meeting that the communists were trying to enforce
conformity to a party line: “I am convinced that our colleagues on the
other side of the fence are completely unable to express their real
opinions.”35</p>
<p>The FBI Files</p>
<p>He had criticized the Soviet Union, refused to visit there, and
opposed the sharing of atomic secrets unless a world government could be
created. He had never worked on the bomb-making project and knew no
classified information about its technology. Nevertheless, Einstein was
unwittingly caught up in a chain of events that showed how suspicious,
intrusive, and inept the FBI could be back then when pursuing the
specter of Soviet communism.</p>
<p>The Red Scares and investigations into communist subversion
originally had some legitimate justifications, but eventually they
included bumbling inquisitions that resembled witch hunts. They began in
earnest at the start of 1950, after America was stunned by news that the
Soviets had developed their own bomb. During the first few weeks of that
year, President Truman launched a program to build a hydrogen bomb, a
refugee German physicist working in Los Alamos named Klaus Fuchs was
arrested as a Soviet spy, and Senator Joseph McCarthy gave his famous
speech, claiming that he had a list of card-carrying communists in the
State Department.</p>
<p>As the head of the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists, Einstein
had dismayed Edward Teller by not supporting the building of the
hydrogen bomb. But Einstein also had not opposed it outright. When A. J.
Muste, a prominent pacifist and socialist activist, asked him to join an
appeal to delay construction of the new weapon, Einstein declined. “Your
new proposal seems quite impractical to me,” he said. “As long as
competitive armament prevails, it will not be possible to halt the
process in one country.”36 It was more sensible, he felt, to push for a
global solution that included a world government.</p>
<p>The day after Einstein wrote that letter, Truman made his
announcement of a full-scale effort to produce the H-bomb. From his
Princeton home, Einstein taped a three-minute appearance for the
premiere of a Sunday evening NBC show called Today with Mrs. Roosevelt.
The former first lady had become a voice of progressivism after the
death of her husband. “Each step appears as the inevitable consequence
of the one that went before,” he said of the arms race. “And at the end,
looming ever clearer, lies general annihilation.” The headline in the
New York Post the next day was, “Einstein Warns World: Outlaw H-Bomb or
Perish.”37</p>
<p>Einstein made another point in his televised talk. He expressed his
growing concern over the U.S. government’s increased security measures
and willingness to compromise the liberties of its citizens. “The
loyalty of citizens, particularly civil servants, is carefully
supervised by a police force growing more powerful every day,” he
warned. “People of independent thought are harassed.”</p>
<p>As if to prove him right, J. Edgar Hoover, who hated communists and
Eleanor Roosevelt with almost equal passion, the very next day called in
the FBI’s chief of domestic intelligence and ordered a report on
Einstein’s loyalty and possible communist connections.</p>
<p>The resulting fifteen-page document, produced two days later, listed
thirty-four organizations, some purportedly communist fronts, that
Einstein had been affiliated with or lent his name to, including the
Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists. “He is principally a pacifist
and could be considered a liberal thinker,” the memo concluded somewhat
benignly, and it did not charge him with being either a communist or
someone who gave information to subversives.38</p>
<p>Indeed, there was nothing that linked Einstein to any security
threat. A reading of the dossier, however, makes the FBI agents look
like Keystone Kops. They bumbled around, unable to answer questions such
as whether Elsa Einstein was his first wife, whether Helen Dukas was a
Soviet spy while in Germany, and whether Einstein had been responsible
for bringing Klaus Fuchs into the United States. (In all three cases,
the correct answer was no.)</p>
<p>The agents also tried to pin down a tip that Elsa had told a friend
in California that they had a son by the name of Albert Einstein Jr.who
was being held in Russia. In fact, Hans Albert Einstein was by then an
engineering professor at Berkeley. Neither he nor Eduard, still in a
Swiss sanatorium, had ever been to Russia.(If there was any basis to the
rumor, it was that Elsa’s daughter Margot had married a Russian, who
returned there after they divorced, though the FBI never found that
out.)</p>
<p>The FBI had been gathering rumors about Einstein ever since the 1932
screed from Mrs. Frothingham and her women patriots. Now it began
systematically keeping track of that material in one growing dossier. It
included such tips as one from a Berlin woman who sent him a
mathematical scheme for winning the Berlin lottery and had concluded he
was a communist when he did not respond to her.39 By the time he died,
the Bureau would amass 1,427 pages stored in fourteen boxes, all stamped
Confidential but containing nothing incriminating.40</p>
<p>What is most notable, in retrospect, about Einstein’s FBI file is not
all the odd tips it contained, but the one relevant piece of information
that was completely missing. Einstein did in fact consort with a Soviet
spy, unwittingly. But the FBI remained clueless about it.</p>
<p>The spy was Margarita Konenkova, who lived in Greenwich Village with
her husband, the Russian realist sculptor Sergei Konenkov, mentioned
earlier. A former lawyer who spoke five languages and had an engaging
way with men, so to speak, her job as a Russian secret agent was to try
to influence American scientists. She had been introduced to Einstein by
Margot, and she became a frequent visitor to Princeton during the
war.</p>
<p>Out of duty or desire, she embarked on an affair with the widowed
Einstein. One weekend during the summer of 1941, she and some friends
invited him to a cottage on Long Island, and to everyone’s surprise he
accepted. They packed a lunch of boiled chicken, took the train from
Penn Station, and spent a pleasant weekend during which Einstein sailed
on the Sound and scribbled equations on the porch. At one point they
went to a secluded beach to watch the sunset and almost got arrested by
a local policeman who had no idea who Einstein was. “Can’t you read,”
the officer said, pointing to a no-trespassing sign. He and Konenkova
remained lovers until she returned to Moscow in 1945 at age 51.41</p>
<p>She succeeded in introducing him to the Soviet vice consul in New
York, who was also a spy. But Einstein had no secrets to share, nor is
there any evidence that he had any inclination at all to help the
Soviets in any way, and he rebuffed her attempts to get him to visit
Moscow.</p>
<p>The affair and potential security issue came to light not because of
any FBI sleuthing but because a collection of nine amorous letters
written by Einstein to Konenkova in the 1940s became public in 1998. In
addition, a former Soviet spy, Pavel Sudoplatov, published a rather
explosive but not totally reliable memoir in which he revealed that she
was an agent code-named “Lukas.”42</p>
<p>Einstein’s letters to Konenkova were written the year after she left
America. Neither she nor Sudoplatov, nor anyone else, ever claimed that
Einstein passed along any secrets, wittingly or unwittingly. However,
the letters do make clear that, at age 66, he was still able to be
amorous in prose and probably in person. “I recently washed my hair
myself, but not with great success,” he said in one. “I am not as
careful as you are.”</p>
<p>Even with his Russian lover, however, Einstein made clear that he was
not an unalloyed lover of Russia. In one letter he denigrated Moscow’s
militaristic May Day celebration, saying, “I watch these exaggerated
patriotic exhibits with concern.”43 Any expressions of excess
nationalism and militarism had always made him uncomfortable, ever since
he had watched German soldiers march by when he was a boy, and Russia’s
were no different.</p>
<p>Einstein’s Politics</p>
<p>Despite Hoover’s suspicions, Einstein was a solid American citizen,
and he considered his opposition to the wave of security and loyalty
investigations to be a defense of the nation’s true values. Tolerance of
free expression and independence of thought, he repeatedly argued, were
the core values that Americans, to his delight, most cherished.</p>
<p>His first two presidential votes had been cast for Franklin
Roosevelt, whom he publicly and enthusiastically endorsed. In 1948,
dismayed by Harry Truman’s cold war policies, Einstein voted for the
Progressive Party candidate Henry Wallace, who advocated greater
cooperation with Russia and increased social welfare spending.</p>
<p>Throughout his life, Einstein was consistent in the fundamental
premises of his politics. Ever since his student days in Switzerland, he
had supported socialist economic policies tempered by a strong instinct
for individual freedom, personal autonomy, democratic institutions, and
protection of liberties. He befriended many of the democratic socialist
leaders in Britain and America, such as Bertrand Russell and Norman
Thomas, and in 1949 he wrote an influential essay for the inaugural
issue of the Monthly Review titled “Why Socialism?”</p>
<p>In it he argued that unrestrained capitalism produced great
disparities of wealth, cycles of boom and depression, and festering
levels of unemployment. The system encouraged selfishness instead of
cooperation, and acquiring wealth rather than serving others. People
were educated for careers rather than for a love of work and creativity.
And political parties became corrupted by political contributions from
owners of great capital.</p>
<p>These problems could be avoided, Einstein argued in his article,
through a socialist economy, if it guarded against tyranny and
centralization of power. “A planned economy, which adjusts production to
the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among
all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man,
woman, and child,” he wrote. “The education of the individual, in
addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop
in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the
glorification of power and success in our present society.”</p>
<p>He added, however, that planned economies faced the danger of
becoming oppressive, bureaucratic, and tyrannical, as had happened in
communist countries such as Russia. “A planned economy may be
accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual,” he warned.
It was therefore important for social democrats who believed in
individual liberty to face two critical questions: “How is it possible,
in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic
power, to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and
overweening? How can the rights of the individual be protected?”44</p>
<p>That imperative—to protect the rights of the individual—was
Einstein’s most fundamental political tenet. Individualism and freedom
were necessary for creative art and science to flourish. Personally,
politically, and professionally, he was repulsed by any restraints.</p>
<p>That is why he remained outspoken about racial discrimination in
America. In Princeton during the 1940s, movie theaters were still
segregated, blacks were not allowed to try on shoes or clothes at
department stores, and the student newspaper declared that equal access
for blacks to the university was “a noble sentiment but the time had not
yet come.”45</p>
<p>As a Jew who had grown up in Germany, Einstein was acutely sensitive
to such discrimination. “The more I feel an American, the more this
situation pains me,” he wrote in an essay called “The Negro Question”
for Pageant magazine. “I can escape the feeling of complicity in it only
by speaking out.”46</p>
<p>Although he rarely accepted in person the many honorary degrees
offered to him, Einstein made an exception when he was invited to
Lincoln University, a black institution in Pennsylvania. Wearing his
tattered gray herringbone jacket, he stood at a blackboard and went over
his relativity equations for students, and then he gave a graduation
address in which he denounced segregation as “an American tradition
which is uncritically handed down from one generation to the next.”47 As
if to break the pattern, he met with the 6-year-old son of Horace Bond,
the university’s president. That son, Julian, went on to become a
Georgia state senator, one of the leaders of the civil rights movement,
and chairman of the NAACP.</p>
<p>There was, however, one group for which Einstein could feel little
tolerance after the war. “The Germans, as a whole nation, are
responsible for these mass killings and should be punished as a people,”
he declared.48 When a German friend, James Franck, asked him at the end
of 1945 to join an appeal calling for a lenient treatment of the German
economy, Einstein angrily refused. “It is absolutely necessary to
prevent the restoration of German industrial policy for many years,” he
said. “Should your appeal be circulated, I shall do whatever I can to
oppose it.” When Franck persisted, Einstein became even more adamant.
“The Germans butchered millions of civilians according to a
well-prepared plan,” he wrote. “They would do it again if only they were
able to. Not a trace of guilt or remorse is to be found among
them.”49</p>
<p>Einstein would not even permit his books to be sold in Germany again,
nor would he allow his name to be placed back on the rolls of any German
scientific society. “The crimes of the Germans are really the most
abominable ever to be recorded in the history of the so-called civilized
nations,” he wrote the physicist Otto Hahn. “The conduct of the German
intellectuals—viewed as a class—was no better than that of the
mob.”50</p>
<p>Like many Jewish refugees, his feelings had a personal basis. Among
those who suffered under the Nazis was his first cousin Roberto, son of
Uncle Jakob. When German troops were retreating from Italy near the end
of the war, they wantonly killed his wife and two daughters, then burned
his home while he hid in the woods. Roberto wrote to Einstein, giving
the horrible details, and committed suicide a year later.51</p>
<p>The result was that Einstein’s national and tribal kinship became
even more clear in his own mind. “I am not a German but a Jew by
nationality,” he declared as the war ended.52</p>
<p>Yet in ways that were subtle yet real, he had become an American as
well. After settling in Princeton in 1933, he never once in the
remaining twenty-two years of his life left the United States, except
for the brief cruise to Bermuda that was necessary to launch his
immigration process.</p>
<p>Admittedly, he was a somewhat contrarian citizen. But in that regard
he was in the tradition of some venerable strands in the fabric of
American character: fiercely protective of individual liberties, often
cranky about government interference, distrustful of great
concentrations of wealth, and a believer in the idealistic
internationalism that gained favor among American intellectuals after
both of the great wars of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>His penchant for dissent and nonconformity did not make him a worse
American, he felt, but a better one. On the day in 1940 when he was
naturalized as a citizen, Einstein had touched on these values in a
radio talk. After the war ended, Truman proclaimed a day in honor of all
new citizens, and the judge who had naturalized Einstein sent out
thousands of form letters inviting anyone he had sworn in to come to a
park in Trenton to celebrate. To the judge’s amazement, ten thousand
people showed up. Even more amazing, Einstein and his household decided
to come down for the festivities. During the ceremony, he sat smiling
and waving, with a young girl sitting on his lap, happy to be a small
part of “I Am an American” Day.53</p>
