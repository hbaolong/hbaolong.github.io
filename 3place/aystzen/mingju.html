<li><p>Instead, inertia was caused only by rotation relative to all the
other objects in the universe. “According to my theory, inertia is
simply an interaction between masses, not an effect in which ‘space’ of
itself is involved, separate from the observed mass,” Einstein told
Schwarzschild. “It can be put this way. If I allow all things to vanish,
then according to Newton the Galilean inertial space remains; following
my interpretation, however, nothing remains.”5</p></li>

the Jews are a group of people unto themselves,” he wrote. “Their

<li><p>Einstein had initially enthused that general relativity explained
rotation as being simply a motion relative to other objects in space,
just as Mach had argued. In other words, if you were inside a bucket

<li><p>The official name of the institution was the Eidgenössische
Polytechnische Schule. In 1911, it gained the right to grant doctoral
degrees and changed its name to the Eidgenössische Technische
Hochschule, or the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, referred to as
the ETH. Einstein, then and later, usually called it the Züricher
Polytechnikum, or the Zurich Polytechnic.</p></li>
<li><p>The phrase “valiant Swabian,” used often by Einstein to refer to
himself, comes from the poem “Swabian Tale” by Ludwig Uhland.</p></li>
<li><p>The letters were discovered by John Stachel of the Einstein
Papers Project among a cache of four hundred family letters that were
stored in a California safe deposit box by the second wife of Einstein’s
son Hans Albert Einstein, whose first wife had brought them to
California after she went to Zurich to clean out Mileva Mari’s apartment
following her death in 1948.</p></li>
<li><p>Once married, she usually used the name Mileva Einstein-Mari.
After they were divorced, she eventually resumed using Mileva Mari. To
avoid confusion, I refer to her as Mari throughout.</p></li>
<li><p>A person “at rest” on the equator is actually spinning with the
earth’s rotation at 1,040 miles per hour and orbiting with the earth
around the sun at 67,000 miles per hour. When I refer to these observers
being at a constant velocity, I am ignoring the change in velocity that
arises from being on a rotating and orbiting planet, which would not
affect most common experiments. (See Miller 1999, 25.)</p></li>
<li><p>More precisely, 186,282.4 miles per second or 299,792,458 meters
per second, in a vacuum. Unless otherwise specified, the “speed of
light” is for light in a vacuum and refers to all electromagnetic waves,
visible or not. This is also, as Maxwell discovered, the speed of
electricity through a wire.</p></li>
<li><p>If the source of sound is rushing toward you, the waves will not
get to you any faster. However, in what is known as the Doppler effect,
the waves will be compressed and the interval between them will be
smaller. The decreased wavelength means a higher frequency, which
results in a higher-pitched sound (or a lower one, when the siren passes
by and starts moving away). A similar effect happens with light. If the
source is moving toward you, the wavelength decreases (and frequency
increases) so it is shifted to the blue end of the spectrum. Light from
a source moving away will be red-shifted.</p></li>
<li><p>Later, upon his father’s death, he became Max von Laue.</p></li>
<li><p>The German phrase he used was “der glücklichste Gedanke,” which
has usually been translated as “happiest” thought, but perhaps in this
context is more properly translated as “luckiest” or “most
fortunate.”</p></li>
<li><p>Added to her 1903 physics prize, she thus became the first person
to win Nobels in two different fields. The only other person to do so
was Linus Pauling, who won for chemistry in 1954, and then won the 1962
Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against nuclear weapons
testing.</p></li>
<li><p>She was born Elsa Einstein, became Elsa Löwenthal during her
brief marriage to a Berlin merchant, and was referred to as Elsa
Einstein by Albert Einstein even before they married. For clarity, I
refer to her as Elsa throughout.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the school had been renamed, Einstein continued to call
it the Polytechnic (“Polytechnikum”) and, for clarity, I will continue
to use this name.</p></li>
<li><p>See chapter 7. For purposes of this discussion, we are referring
to a uniformly and rectilinearly accelerated reference frame and a
static and homogeneous gravitational field.</p></li>
<li><p>I am using the numbers in Einstein’s original calculations.
Subsequent data caused it to be revised to about 0.85 second of arc.
Also, as we shall see, he later revised his theory to predict twice the
bending. An arc-second, or second of arc, is an angle of 1?3,600 of a
degree.</p></li>
<li><p>Here’s how it works. If you are at some point in curved space and
want to know the distance to a neighboring point—infinitesimally
close—then things can be complicated if you have just the Pythagorean
theorem and some general geometry to use. The distance to a nearby point
to the north may need to be computed differently from the distance to
one to the east or to one in the up direction. You need something
comparable to a little scorecard at each point of space to tell you the
distance to each of these points. In four-dimensional spacetime your
scorecard will require ten numbers for you to be able to deal with all
the questions pertaining to spacetime distances to nearby points. You
need such a scorecard for every point in the spacetime. But once you
have those scorecards, you can figure out the distance along any curve:
just add up the distances along each infinitesimal bit using the
scorecards as you pass them. These scorecards form the metric tensor,
which is a field in spacetime. In other words, it is something defined
at every point, but that can have differing values at every point. I am
grateful to Professor John D. Norton for helping with this
section.</p></li>
<li><p>For clarity, I refer to the boy by both of his given names, Hans
Albert, although his father invariably referred to him simply as Albert.
At one point, Einstein wrote a letter to his son and signed it “Albert”
instead of “Papa.” In his next letter, he awkwardly began, “The
explanation for the curious signature on my last letter is that, in my
absentmindedness, instead of signing my own name, I frequently sign for
the person to whom the letter is addressed” (Einstein to Hans Albert
Einstein, March 11 and 16, 1916).</p></li>
<li><p>Einstein’s salary after tax was 13,000 marks. Inflation was
beginning to set in, and the value of the German mark had fallen from 24
cents in 1914 to 19 cents in January 1918. One mark at the time would
buy two dozen eggs or four loaves of bread. (A year later, the mark
would be worth only 12 cents, and when hyperinflation began to rage in
January 1920 only 2 cents.) Mari’s stipend of 6,000 marks in January
1918 was thus worth about ,140, or just under 5,000 in
inflation-adjusted 2006 dollars. His proposal was to increase this by 50
percent.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 14 describes Einstein’s revision of this view in a 1920
lecture in Leiden.</p></li>
<li><p>See chapter 14 for Einstein’s decision to renounce the term when
he discovered the universe was expanding.</p></li>
<li><p>The word Einstein used was Stammesgenossen. Although Stamm
generally means tribe, that translation can have some racial overtones.
Some Einstein scholars have said that translations such as “kindred” or
“clan” or “lineage” might be clearer.</p></li>
<li><p>I have used the translation preferred by Abraham Pais. Einstein’s
words in German were, “Raffiniert ist der Herr Gott, aber boshaft ist er
nicht.”</p></li>
<li><p>Governor Channing Cox had been thrust a version of the test
earlier that week, and his first three responses were: Where does
shellac come from? “From a can.” What is a monsoon? “A funny-sounding
word.” Where do we get prunes? “Breakfast.”</p></li>
<li><p>Robert Andrews Millikan would win the Nobel Prize the following
year, 1923, for experimental work on the photoelectric effect he had
done at the University of Chicago. By then he had become director of the
physics lab at the California Institute of Technology, and in the early
1930s he would bring Einstein there as a visiting scientist.</p></li>
<li><p>See page 119 for Newton’s thought experiment about whether water
rotating in a bucket in empty space would be subject to inertial
pressure and thus press against the sides of the bucket. See page 251
for Einstein’s 1916 view, which he was now revising, that an empty
universe would have no inertia or fabric of spacetime.</p></li>
<li><p>The de Broglie wavelength of a baseball thrown at 90 mph would be
about 10–34 meters, incredibly smaller than the size of an atom or even
a proton, so infinitessimal as to be unobservable.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1995, Bose-Einstein condensation was finally achieved
experimentally by Eric A. Cornell, Wolfgang Ketterle, and Carl E.
Wieman, who were awarded the 2001 Nobel Prize for this work.</p></li>
<li><p>From his 1905 special relativity paper: “It is well known that
Maxwell’s electrodynamics—as usually understood now—when applied to
moving bodies leads to asymmetries that do not seem inherent in the
phenomena. Take, for example, the electrodynamic interaction between a
magnet and a conductor.” From the 1905 light quanta paper: “A profound
formal difference exists between the theories that physicists have
formed about gases and other ponderable bodies, and Maxwell’s theory of
electromagnetic processes in so-called empty space.”</p></li>
<li><p>“To be is to be perceived,” meaning that it makes no sense to say
that unperceived things—most famously Berkeley’s example of trees in a
forest “and no body by to perceive them”—actually exist (George
Berkeley, Principles of Human Knowledge, section 23).</p></li>
<li><p>As Eddington showed, the cosmological term probably would not
have worked even if the universe had turned out to be static. Because it
required such a delicate balance, any small disturbance would have
caused a runaway expansion or contraction of the universe.</p></li>
<li><p>The pacifists assumed that no other explanation was needed, but
some contemporary accounts somehow thought the buttons referred to 2
percent beer.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two related concepts that Einstein uses.Separability
means that different particles or systems that occupy different regions
in space have an independent reality; locality means that an action
involving one of these particles or systems cannot influence a particle
or system in another part of space unless something travels the distance
between them, a process limited by the speed of light.</p></li>
<li><p>An aneurysm is the ballooning or dilation of a blood vessel, as
if it were blistering. The abdominal aorta is one of the large arteries
from the heart, in the region between the diaphragm and the
abdomen.</p></li>
