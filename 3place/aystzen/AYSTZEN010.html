<h4 id="chapter-seven-the-happiest-thought">CHAPTER SEVEN THE HAPPIEST
THOUGHT</h4>
<p>1906–1909</p>
<p>Recognition</p>
<p>Einstein’s 1905 burst of creativity was astonishing. He had devised a
revolutionary quantum theory of light, helped prove the existence of
atoms, explained Brownian motion, upended the concept of space and time,
and produced what would become science’s best known equation. But not
many people seemed to notice at first. According to his sister, Einstein
had hoped that his flurry of essays in a preeminent journal would lift
him from the obscurity of a third-class patent examiner and provide some
academic recognition, perhaps even an academic job. “But he was bitterly
disappointed,” she noted. “Icy silence followed the publication.”1</p>
<p>That was not exactly true. A small but respectable handful of
physicists soon took note of Einstein’s papers, and one of these turned
out to be, as good fortune would have it, the most important possible
admirer he could attract: Max Planck, Europe’s revered monarch of
theoretical physics, whose mysterious mathematical constant explaining
black-body radiation Einstein had transformed into a radical new reality
of nature. As the editorial board member of Annalen der Physik
responsible for theoretical submissions, Planck had vetted Einstein’s
papers, and the one on relativity had “immediately aroused my lively
attention,” he later recalled. As soon as it was published, Planck gave
a lecture on relativity at the University of Berlin.2</p>
<p>Planck became the first physicist to build on Einstein’s theory. In
an article published in the spring of 1906, he argued that relativity
conformed to the principle of least action, a foundation of physics that
holds that light or any object moving between two points should follow
the easiest path.3</p>
<p>Planck’s paper not only contributed to the development of relativity
theory; it also helped to legitimize it among other physicists. Whatever
disappointment Maja Einstein had detected in her brother dissipated. “My
papers are much appreciated and are giving rise to further
investigations,” he exulted to Solovine. “Professor Planck has recently
written to me about that.”4</p>
<p>The proud patent examiner was soon exchanging letters with the
eminent professor. When another theorist challenged Planck’s contention
that relativity theory conformed to the principle of least action,
Einstein took Planck’s side and sent him a card saying so. Planck was
pleased. “As long as the proponents of the principle of relativity
constitute such a modest little band as is now the case,” he replied to
Einstein, “it is doubly important that they agree among themselves.” He
added that he hoped to visit Bern the following year and meet Einstein
personally.5</p>
<p>Planck did not end up coming to Bern, but he did send his earnest
assistant, Max Laue.* He and Einstein had already been corresponding
about Einstein’s light quanta paper, with Laue saying that he agreed
with “your heuristic view that radiation can be absorbed and emitted
only in specific finite quanta.”</p>
<p>However, Laue insisted, just as Planck had, that Einstein was wrong
to assume that these quanta were a characteristic of the radiation
itself. Instead, Laue contended that the quanta were merely a
description of the way that radiation was emitted or absorbed by a piece
of matter. “This is not a characteristic of electromagnetic processes in
a vacuum but rather of the emitting or absorbing matter,” Laue wrote,
“and hence radiation does not consist of light quanta as it says in
section six of your first paper.”6 (In that section, Einstein had said
that the radiation “behaves thermodynamically as if it consisted of
mutually independent energy quanta.”)</p>
<p>When Laue was preparing to visit in the summer of 1907, he was
surprised to discover that Einstein was not at the University of Bern
but was working at the patent office on the third floor of the Post and
Telegraph Building. Meeting Einstein there did not lessen his wonder.
“The young man who came to meet me made so unexpected an impression on
me that I did not believe he could possibly be the father of the
relativity theory,” Laue said, “so I let him pass.” After a while,
Einstein came wandering through the reception area again, and Laue
finally realized who he was.</p>
<p>They walked and talked for hours, with Einstein at one point offering
a cigar that, Laue recalled, “was so unpleasant that I ‘accidentally’
dropped it into the river.” Einstein’s theories, on the other hand, made
a pleasing impression. “During the first two hours of our conversation
he overthrew the entire mechanics and electrodynamics,” Laue noted.
Indeed, he was so enthralled that over the next four years he would
publish eight papers on Einstein’s relativity theory and become a close
friend.7</p>
<p>Some theorists found the amazing flurry of papers from the patent
office to be uncomfortably abstract. Arnold Sommerfeld, later a friend,
was among the first to suggest there was something Jewish about
Einstein’s theoretical approach, a theme later picked up by
anti-Semites. It lacked due respect for the notion of order and
absolutes, and it did not seem solidly grounded. “As remarkable as
Einstein’s papers are,” he wrote Lorentz in 1907, “it still seems to me
that something almost unhealthy lies in this unconstruable and
impossible to visualize dogma. An Englishman would hardly have given us
this theory. It might be here too, as in the case of Cohn, the abstract
conceptual character of the Semite expresses itself.”8</p>
<p>None of this interest made Einstein famous, nor did it get him any
job offers. “I was surprised to read that you must sit in an office for
eight hours a day,” wrote yet another young physicist who was planning
to visit. “History is full of bad jokes.”9 But because he had finally
earned his doctorate, he had at least gotten promoted from a third-class
to a second-class technical expert at the patent office, which came with
a hefty 1,000-franc raise to an annual salary of 4,500 francs.10</p>
<p>His productivity was startling. In addition to working six days a
week at the patent office, he continued his torrent of papers and
reviews: six in 1906 and ten more in 1907. At least once a week he
played in a string quartet. And he was a good father to the 3-year-old
son he proudly labeled “impertinent.” As Mari wrote to her friend Helene
Savi, “My husband often spends his free time at home just playing with
the boy.”11</p>
<p>Beginning in the summer of 1907, Einstein also found time to dabble
in what might have become, if the fates had been more impish, a new
career path: as an inventor and salesman of electrical devices like his
uncle and father. Working with Olympia Academy member Conrad Habicht and
his brother Paul, Einstein developed a machine to amplify tiny
electrical charges so they could be measured and studied. It had more
academic than practical purpose; the idea was to create a lab device
that would permit the study of small electrical fluctuations.</p>
<p>The concept was simple. When two strips of metal move close to each
other, an electric charge on one will induce an opposite charge on the
other. Einstein’s idea was to use a series of strips that would induce
the charge ten times and then transfer that to another disc. The process
would be repeated until the original minuscule charge would be
multiplied by a large number and thus be easily measurable. The trick
was making the contraption actually work.12</p>
<p>Given his heritage, breeding, and years in the patent office,
Einstein had the background to be an engineering genius. But as it
turned out, he was better suited to theorizing. Fortunately, Paul
Habicht was a good machinist, and by August 1907 he had a prototype of
the Maschinchen, or little machine, ready to be unveiled. “I am
astounded at the lightning speed with which you built the Maschinchen,”
Einstein wrote. “I’ll show up on Sunday.” Unfortunately, it didn’t work.
“I am driven by murderous curiosity as to what you’re up to,” Einstein
wrote a month later as they tried to fix things.</p>
<p>Throughout 1908, letters flew back and forth between Einstein and the
Habichts, filled with complex diagrams and a torrent of ideas for how to
make the device work. Einstein published a description in a journal,
which produced, for a while, a potential sponsor. Paul Habicht was able
to build a better version by October, but it had trouble keeping a
charge. He brought the machine to Bern, where Einstein commandeered a
lab in one of the schools and dragooned a local mechanic. By November
the machine seemed to be working. It took another year or so to get a
patent and begin to make some versions for sale. But even then, it never
truly caught hold or found a market, and Einstein eventually lost
interest.13</p>
<p>These practical exploits may have been fun, but Einstein’s glorious
isolation from the priesthood of academic physicists was starting to
have more drawbacks than advantages. In a paper he wrote in the spring
of 1907, he began by exuding a joyful self-assurance about having
neither the library nor the inclination to know what other theorists had
written on the topic. “Other authors might have already clarified part
of what I am going to say,” he wrote. “I felt I could dispense with
doing a literature search (which would have been very troublesome for
me), especially since there is good reason to hope that others will fill
this gap.” However, when he was commissioned to write a major year-book
piece on relativity later that year, there was slightly less cockiness
in his warning to the editor that he might not be aware of all the
literature. “Unfortunately I am not in a position to acquaint myself
about everything that has been published on this subject,” he wrote,
“because the library is closed in my free time.”14</p>
<p>That year he applied for a position at the University of Bern as a
privatdozent, a starter rung on the academic ladder, which involved
giving lectures and collecting a small fee from anyone who felt like
showing up. To become a professor at most European universities, it
helped to serve such an apprenticeship. With his application Einstein
enclosed seventeen papers he had published, including the ones on
relativity and light quanta. He was also expected to include an
unpublished paper known as a habilitation thesis, but he decided not to
bother writing one, as this requirement was sometimes waived for those
who had “other outstanding achievements.”</p>
<p>Only one professor on the faculty committee supported hiring him
without requiring him to write a new thesis, “in view of the important
scientific achievements of Herr Einstein.” The others disagreed, and the
requirement was not waived. Not surprisingly, Einstein considered the
matter “amusing.” He did not write the special habilitation or get the
post.15</p>
<p>The Equivalence of Gravity and Acceleration</p>
<p>Einstein’s road to the general theory of relativity began in November
1907, when he was struggling against a deadline to finish an article for
a science yearbook explaining his special theory of relativity. Two
limitations of that theory still bothered him: it applied only to
uniform constant-velocity motion (things felt and behaved differently if
your speed or direction was changing), and it did not incorporate
Newton’s theory of gravity.</p>
<p>“I was sitting in a chair in the patent office at Bern when all of a
sudden a thought occurred to me,” he recalled. “If a person falls
freely, he will not feel his own weight.”That realization, which
“startled” him, launched him on an arduous eight-year effort to
generalize his special theory of relativity and “impelled me toward a
theory of gravitation.”16 Later, he would grandly call it “the happiest*
thought in my life.”17</p>
<p>The tale of the falling man has become an iconic one, and in some
accounts it actually involves a painter who fell from the roof of an
apartment building near the patent office.18 In fact, probably like
other great tales of gravitational discovery—Galileo dropping objects
from the Tower of Pisa and the apple falling on Newton’s head19—it was
embellished in popular lore and was more of a thought experiment than a
real occurrence. Despite Einstein’s propensity to focus on science
rather than the merely personal, even he was not likely to watch a real
human plunging off a roof and think of gravitational theory, much less
call it the happiest thought in his life.</p>
<p>Einstein refined his thought experiment so that the falling man was
in an enclosed chamber, such as an elevator in free fall above the
earth. In this falling chamber (at least until it crashed), the man
would feel weightless. Any objects he emptied from his pocket and let
loose would float alongside him.</p>
<p>Looking at it another way, Einstein imagined a man in an enclosed
chamber floating in deep space “far removed from stars and other
appreciable masses.” He would experience the same perceptions of
weightlessness. “Gravitation naturally does not exist for this observer.
He must fasten himself with strings to the floor, otherwise the
slightest impact against the floor will cause him to rise slowly towards
the ceiling.”</p>
<p>Then Einstein imagined that a rope was hooked onto the roof of the
chamber and pulled up with a constant force. “The chamber together with
the observer then begin to move ‘upwards’ with a uniformly accelerated
motion.”The man inside will feel himself pressed to the floor. “He is
then standing in the chest in exactly the same way as anyone stands in a
room of a house on our earth.” If he pulls something from his pocket and
lets go, it will fall to the floor “with an accelerated relative motion”
that is the same no matter the weight of the object—just as Galileo
discovered to be the case for gravity. “The man in the chamber will thus
come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational
field. Of course he will be puzzled for a moment as to why the chest
does not fall in this gravitational field. Just then, however, he
discovers the hook in the middle of the lid of the chest and the rope
which is attached to it, and he consequently comes to the conclusion
that the chamber is suspended at rest in the gravitational field.”</p>
<p>“Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his
conclusion?” Einstein asked. Just as with special relativity, there was
no right or wrong perception. “We must rather admit that his mode of
grasping the situation violates neither reason nor known mechanical
laws.”20</p>
<p>A related way that Einstein addressed this same issue was typical of
his ingenuity: he examined a phenomenon that was so very well-known that
scientists rarely puzzled about it. Every object has a “gravitational
mass,” which determines its weight on the earth’s surface or, more
generally, the tug between it and any other object. It also has an
“inertial mass,” which determines how much force must be applied to it
in order to make it accelerate. As Newton noted, the inertial mass of an
object is always the same as its gravitational mass, even though they
are defined differently. This was obviously more than a mere
coincidence, but no one had fully explained why.</p>
<p>Uncomfortable with two explanations for what seemed to be one
phenomenon, Einstein probed the equivalence of inertial mass and
gravitational mass using his thought experiment. If we imagine that the
enclosed elevator is being accelerated upward in a region of outer space
where there is no gravity, then the downward force felt by the man
inside (or the force that tugs downward on an object hanging from the
ceiling by a string) is due to inertial mass. If we imagine that the
enclosed elevator is at rest in a gravitational field, then the downward
force felt by the man inside (or the force that tugs downward on an
object hanging from the ceiling by a string) is due to gravitational
mass. But inertial mass always equals gravitational mass. “From this
correspondence,” said Einstein, “it follows that it is impossible to
discover by experiment whether a given system of coordinates is
accelerated, or whether . . . the observed effects are due to a
gravitational field.”21</p>
<p>Einstein called this “the equivalence principle.”22 The local effects
of gravity and of acceleration are equivalent. This became a foundation
for his attempt to generalize his theory of relativity so that it was
not restricted just to systems that moved with a uniform velocity. The
basic insight that he would develop over the next eight years was that
“the effects we ascribe to gravity and the effects we ascribe to
acceleration are both produced by one and the same structure.”23</p>
<p>Einstein’s approach to general relativity again showed how his mind
tended to work:</p>
<p>• He was disquieted when there were two seemingly unrelated theories
for the same observable phenomenon. That had been the case with the
moving coil or moving magnet producing the same observable electric
current, which he resolved with the special theory of relativity. Now it
was the case with the differing definitions of inertial mass and
gravitational mass, which he began to resolve by building on the
equivalence principle.</p>
<p>• He was likewise uncomfortable when a theory made distinctions that
could not be observed in nature. That had been the case with observers
in uniform motion: there was no way of determining who was at rest and
who was in motion. Now it was also, apparently, the case for observers
in accelerated motion: there was no way of telling who was accelerating
and who was in a gravitational field.</p>
<p>• He was eager to generalize theories rather than settling for having
them restricted to a special case. There should not, he felt, be one set
of principles for the special case of constant-velocity motion and a
different set for all other types of motion. His life was a constant
quest for unifying theories.</p>
<p>In November 1907, working against the deadline imposed by the
Yearbook of Radioactivity and Electronics, Einstein tacked on a fifth
section to his article on relativity that sketched out his new ideas.
“So far we have applied the principle of relativity …only to
nonaccelerated reference systems,” he began. “Is it conceivable that the
principle of relativity applies to systems that are accelerated relative
to each other?”</p>
<p>Imagine two environments, he said, one being accelerated and the
other resting in a gravitational field.24 There is no physical
experiment you can do that would tell these situations apart. “In the
discussion that follows, we shall therefore assume the complete physical
equivalence of a gravitational field and a corresponding acceleration of
the reference system.”</p>
<p>Using various mathematical calculations that can be made about an
accelerated system, Einstein proceeded to show that, if his notions were
correct, clocks would run more slowly in a more intense gravitational
field. He also came up with many predictions that could be tested,
including that light should be bent by gravity and that the wavelength
of light emitted from a source with a large mass, such as the sun,
should increase slightly in what has become known as the gravitational
redshift. “On the basis of some ruminating, which, though daring, does
have something going for it, I have arrived at the view that the
gravitational difference might be the cause of the shift to the red end
of the spectrum,” he explained to a colleague. “A bending of light rays
by gravity also follows from these arguments.”25</p>
<p>It would take Einstein another eight years, until November 1915, to
work out the fundamentals of this theory and find the math to express
it. Then it would take another four years before the most vivid of his
predictions, the extent to which gravity would bend light, was verified
by dramatic observations. But at least Einstein now had a vision, one
that started him on the road toward one of the most elegant and
impressive achievements in the history of physics: the general theory of
relativity.</p>
<p>Winning a Professorship</p>
<p>By the beginning of 1908, even as such academic stars as Max Planck
and Wilhelm Wien were writing to ask for his insights, Einstein had
tempered his aspirations to be a university professor. Instead, he had
begun, believe it or not, to seek work as a high school teacher. “This
craving,” he told Marcel Grossmann, who had helped him get the
patent-office job, “comes only from my ardent wish to be able to
continue my private scientific work under easier conditions.”</p>
<p>He was even eager to go back to the Technical School in Winter-hur,
where he had briefly been a substitute teacher. “How does one go about
this?” he asked Grossmann. “Could I possibly call on somebody and talk
him into the great worth of my admirable person as a teacher and a
citizen? Wouldn’t I make a bad impression on him (no Swiss-German
dialect, my Semitic appearance, etc.)?” He had written papers that were
transforming physics, but he did not know if that would help. “Would
there be any point in my stressing my scientific papers on that
occasion?”26</p>
<p>He also responded to an advertisement for a “teacher of mathematics
and descriptive geometry” at a high school in Zurich, noting in his
application “that I would be ready to teach physics as well.” He ended
up deciding to enclose all of the papers he had written thus far,
including the special theory of relativity. There were twenty-one
applicants. Einstein did not even make the list of three
finalists.27</p>
<p>So Einstein finally overcame his pride and decided to write a thesis
in order to become a privatdozent at Bern. As he explained to the patron
there who had supported him, “The conversation I had with you in the
city library, as well as the advice of several friends, has induced me
to change my decision for the second time and to try my luck with a
habilitation at the University of Bern after all.”28</p>
<p>The paper he submitted, an extension of his revolutionary work on
light quanta, was promptly accepted, and at the end of February 1908, he
was made a privatdozent. He had finally scaled the walls, or at least
the outer wall, of academe. But his post neither paid enough nor was
important enough for him to give up his job at the patent office. His
lectures at the University of Bern thus became simply one more thing for
him to do.</p>
<p>His topic for the summer of 1908 was the theory of heat, held on
Tuesday and Saturday at 7 a.m., and he initially attracted only three
attendees: Michele Besso and two other colleagues who worked at the
postal building. In the winter session he switched to the theory of
radiation, and his three coworkers were joined by an actual student
named Max Stern. By the summer of 1909, Stern was the only attendee, and
Einstein canceled his lecturing. He had, in the meantime, begun to adopt
his professorial look: both his hair and clothing became a victim of
nature’s tendency toward randomness.29</p>
<p>Alfred Kleiner, the University of Zurich physics professor who helped
Einstein get his doctorate, had encouraged him to pursue the
privatdozent position.30 He also had waged a long effort, which
succeeded in 1908, to convince the Zurich authorities to increase the
university’s stature by creating a new position in theoretical physics.
It was not a full professorship; instead, it was an associate
professorship under Kleiner.</p>
<p>It was the obvious post for Einstein, but there was one obstacle.
Kleiner had another candidate in mind: his assistant Friedrich Adler, a
pale and passionate political activist who had become friends with
Einstein when they were both at the Polytechnic. Adler, whose father was
the leader of the Social Democratic Party in Austria, was more disposed
to political philosophy than theoretical physics. So he went to see
Kleiner one morning in June 1908, and the two of them concluded that
Adler was not right for the job and Einstein was.</p>
<p>In a letter to his father, Adler recounted the conversation and said
that Einstein “had no understanding how to relate to people” and had
been “treated by the professors at the Polytechnic with outright
contempt.” But Adler said he deserved the job because of his genius and
was likely to get it. “They have a bad conscience over how they treated
him earlier. The scandal is being felt not only here but in Germany that
such a man would have to sit in the patent office.”31</p>
<p>Adler made sure that the Zurich authorities, and for that matter
everyone else, knew that he was officially stepping aside for his
friend. “If it is possible to get a man like Einstein for our
university, it would be absurd to appoint me,” he wrote. That resolved
the political issue for the councilor in charge of education, who was a
partisan Social Democrat. “Ernst would have liked Adler, since he was a
fellow party member,” Einstein explained to Michele Besso. “But Adler’s
statements about himself and me made it impossible.”32</p>
<p>So, at the end of June 1908, Kleiner traveled from Zurich to Bern to
audit one of Einstein’s privatdozent lectures and, as Einstein put it,
“size up the beast.” Alas, it was not a great show. “I really did not
lecture divinely,” Einstein lamented to a friend, “partly because I was
not well prepared, partly because being investigated got on my nerves a
bit.” Kleiner sat listening with a wrinkled brow, and after the lecture
he informed Einstein that his teaching style was not good enough to
qualify him for the professorship. Einstein calmly claimed that he
considered the job “quite unnecessary.”33</p>
<p>Kleiner went back to Zurich and reported that Einstein “holds
monologues” and was “a long way from being a teacher.” That seemed to
end his chances. As Adler informed his powerful father, “The situation
has therefore changed, and the Einstein business is closed.” Einstein
pretended to be sanguine. “The business with the professorship fell
through, but that’s all right with me,” he wrote a friend. “There are
enough teachers even without me.”34</p>
<p>In fact Einstein was upset, and he became even more so when he heard
that Kleiner’s criticism of his teaching skills was being widely
circulated, even in Germany. So he wrote to Kleiner, angrily reproaching
him “for spreading unfavorable rumors about me.” He was already finding
it difficult to get a proper academic job, and Kleiner’s assessment
would make it impossible.</p>
<p>There was some validity to Kleiner’s criticism. Einstein was never an
inspired teacher, and his lectures tended to be regarded as disorganized
until his celebrity ensured that every stumble he made was transformed
into a charming anecdote. Nevertheless, Kleiner relented. He said that
he would be pleased to help him get the Zurich job if he could only show
“some teaching ability.”</p>
<p>Einstein replied by suggesting that he come to Zurich to give a
full-fledged (and presumably well-prepared) lecture to the physics
society there, which he did in February 1909. “I was lucky,” Einstein
reported soon after. “Contrary to my habit, I lectured well on that
occasion.”35 When he went to call on Kleiner afterward, the professor
intimated that a job offer would soon follow.</p>
<p>A few days after Einstein returned to Bern, Kleiner provided his
official recommendation to the University of Zurich faculty. “Einstein
ranks among the most important theoretical physicists and has been
recognized as such since his work on the relativity principle,” he
wrote. As for Einstein’s teaching skills, he said as politely as
possible that they were ripe for improvement: “Dr. Einstein will prove
his worth also as a teacher, because he is too intelligent and too
conscientious not to be open to advice when necessary.”36</p>
<p>One issue was Einstein’s Jewishness. Some faculty members considered
this a potential problem, but they were assured by Kleiner that Einstein
did not exhibit the “unpleasant peculiarities” supposedly associated
with Jews. Their conclusion is a revealing look at both the
anti-Semitism of the time and the attempts to rise above it:</p>
<p>The expressions of our colleague Kleiner, based on several years of
personal contact, were all the more valuable for the committee as well
as for the faculty as a whole since Herr Dr. Einstein is an Israelite
and since precisely to the Israelites among scholars are inscribed (in
numerous cases not entirely without cause) all kinds of unpleasant
peculiarities of character, such as intrusiveness, impudence, and a
shopkeeper’s mentality in the perception of their academic position. It
should be said, however, that also among the Israelites there exist men
who do not exhibit a trace of these disagreeable qualities and that it
is not proper, therefore, to disqualify a man only because he happens to
be a Jew. Indeed, one occasionally finds people also among non-Jewish
scholars who in regard to a commercial perception and utilization of
their academic profession develop qualities that are usually considered
as specifically Jewish. Therefore, neither the committee nor the faculty
as a whole considered it compatible with its dignity to adopt
anti-Semitism as a matter of policy.37</p>
<p>The secret faculty vote in late March 1909 was ten in favor and one
abstention. Einstein was offered his first professorship, four years
after he had revolutionized physics. Unfortunately, his proposed salary
was less than what he was making at the patent office, so he declined.
Finally, the Zurich authorities raised their offer, and Einstein
accepted. “So, now I too am an official member of the guild of whores,”
he exulted to a colleague.38</p>
<p>One person who saw a newspaper notice about Einstein’s appointment
was a Basel housewife named Anna Meyer-Schmid. Ten years earlier, when
she was an unmarried girl of 17, they had met during one of Einstein’s
vacations with his mother at the Hotel Paradies. Most of the guests had
seemed to him “philistines,” but he took a liking to Anna and even wrote
a poem in her album: “What should I inscribe for you here? / I could
think of many things / Including a kiss / On your tiny little mouth / If
you’re angry about it / Do not start to cry / The best punishment / Is
to give me one too.” He signed it, “Your rascally friend.”39</p>
<p>In response to a congratulatory postcard from her, Einstein replied
with a polite and mildly suggestive letter. “I probably cherish the
memory of the lovely weeks that I was allowed to spend near you in the
Paradies more than you do,” he wrote. “So now I’ve become such a big
schoolmaster that my name is even mentioned in the newspapers. But I
have remained a simple fellow.” He noted that he had married his college
friend Mari, but he gave her his office address. “If you ever happen to
be in Zurich and have time, look me up there; it would give me great
pleasure.”40</p>
<p>Whether or not Einstein intended his response to hover uncertainly
between innocence and suggestiveness, Anna’s eyes apparently snapped it
into the latter position. She wrote a letter back, which Mari
intercepted. Her jealousy aroused, Mari then wrote a letter to Anna’s
husband claiming (wishfully more than truthfully) that Einstein was
outraged by Anna’s “inappropriate letter” and brazen attempt to rekindle
a relationship.</p>
<p>Einstein ended up having to calm matters with an apology to the
husband. “I am very sorry if I have caused you distress by my careless
behavior,” he wrote. “I answered the congratulatory card your wife sent
me on the occasion of my appointment too heartily and thereby
re-awakened the old affection we had for each other. But this was not
done with impure intentions. The behavior of your wife, for whom I have
the greatest respect, was totally honorable. It was wrong of my wife—and
excusable only on account of extreme jealousy—to behave—without my
knowledge—the way she did.”</p>
<p>Although the incident itself was of no consequence, it marked a turn
in Einstein’s relationship with Mari. In his eyes, her brooding jealousy
was making her darker. Decades later, still rankling at Mari’s behavior,
he wrote to Anna’s daughter asserting, with a brutal bluntness, that his
wife’s jealousy had been a pathological flaw typical of a woman of such
“uncommon ugliness.”41</p>
<p>Mari indeed had a jealous streak. She resented not only her husband’s
flirtations with other women but also the time he spent with male
colleagues. Now that he had become a professor, she succumbed to a
professional envy that was understandable given her own curtailed
scientific career. “With that kind of fame, he does not have much time
left for his wife,” she told her friend Helene Savi. “You wrote that I
must be jealous of science. But what can you do? One gets the pearl, the
other the box.”</p>
<p>In particular, Mari worried that her husband’s fame would make him
colder and more self-centered. “I am very happy for his success, because
he really does deserve it,” she wrote in another letter. “I only hope
that fame does not exert a detrimental influence on his human
side.”42</p>
<p>In one sense, Mari’s worries proved unwarranted. Even as his fame
increased exponentially, Einstein would retain a personal simplicity, an
unaffected style, and at least a veneer of genial humility. But viewed
from a different reference frame, there were transformations to his
human side. Sometime around 1909, he began drifting apart from his wife.
His resistance to chains and bonds increasingly led him to escape into
his work while taking a detached approach to the realm he dismissed as
“the merely personal.”</p>
<p>On one of his last days working at the patent office, he received a
large envelope with an elegant sheet covered in what seemed to be Latin
calligraphy. Because it seemed odd and impersonal, he threw it in the
wastebasket. It was, in fact, an invitation to be one of those receiving
an honorary doctorate at the July 1909 commemoration of the founding of
Geneva’s university, and authorities there finally got a friend of
Einstein to persuade him to attend. Einstein brought only a straw hat
and an informal suit, so he stood out rather strangely, both in the
parade and at the opulent formal dinner that night. Amused by the whole
situation, he turned to the patrician seated next to him and speculated
about the austere Protestant Reformation leader who had founded the
university: “Do you know what Calvin would have done had he been here?”
The gentleman, befuddled, said no. Einstein replied, “He would have
erected an enormous stake and had us all burnt for our sinful
extravagance.” As Einstein later recalled,“The man never addressed
another word to me.”43</p>
<p>Light Can Be Wave and Particle</p>
<p>Also at the end of the summer of 1909, Einstein was invited to
address the annual Naturforscher conference, the preeminent meeting of
German-speaking scientists, which was held that year in Salzburg.
Organizers had put both relativity and the quantum nature of light on
the agenda, and they expected him to speak on the former. Instead,
Einstein decided that he preferred to emphasize what he considered the
more pressing issue: how to interpret quantum theory and reconcile it
with the wave theory of light that Maxwell had so elegantly
formulated.</p>
<p>After his “happiest thought” at the end of 1907 about how the
equivalence of gravity and acceleration might lead to a generalization
of relativity theory, Einstein had put that subject aside to focus
instead on what he called “the radiation problem” (i.e., quantum
theory). The more he thought about his “heuristic” notion that light was
made up of quanta, or indivisible packets, the more he worried that he
and Planck had wrought a revolution that would destroy the classical
foundations of physics, especially Maxwell’s equations. “I have come to
this pessimistic view mainly as a result of endless, vain efforts to
interpret . . . Planck’s constant in an intuitive way,” he wrote a
fellow physicist early in 1908. “I even seriously doubt that it will be
possible to maintain the general validity of Maxwell’s equations.”44 (As
it turned out, his love of Maxwell’s equations was well placed. They are
among the few elements of theoretical physics to remain unchanged by
both the relativity and quantum revolutions that Einstein helped
launch.)</p>
<p>When Einstein, still not officially a professor, arrived at the
Salzburg conference in September 1909, he finally met Max Planck and
other giants that he had known only through letters. On the afternoon of
the third day, he stepped in front of more than a hundred famed
scientists and delivered a speech that Wolfgang Pauli, who was to become
a pioneer of quantum mechanics, later pronounced “one of the landmarks
in the development of theoretical physics.”</p>
<p>Einstein began by explaining how the wave theory of light was no
longer complete. Light (or any radiation) could also be regarded, he
said, as a beam of particles or packets of energy, which he said was
akin to what Newton had posited. “Light has certain basic properties
that can be understood more readily from the standpoint of the Newtonian
emission theory than from the standpoint of the wave theory,” he
declared. “I thus believe that the next phase of theoretical physics
will bring us a theory of light that can be interpreted as a kind of
fusion of the wave and of the emission theories of light.”</p>
<p>Combining particle theory with wave theory, he warned, would bring “a
profound change.” This was not a good thing, he feared. It could
undermine the certainties and determinism inherent in classical
physics.</p>
<p>For a moment, Einstein mused that perhaps such a fate could be
avoided by accepting Planck’s more limited interpretation of quanta:
that they were features only of how radiation was emitted and absorbed
by a surface rather than a feature of the actual light wave as it
propagated through space. “Would it not be possible,” he asked, “to
retain at least the equations for the propagation of radiation and
conceive only the processes of emission and absorption differently?” But
after comparing the behavior of light to the behavior of gas molecules,
as he had done in his 1905 light quanta paper, Einstein concluded that,
alas, this was not possible.</p>
<p>As a result, Einstein said, light must be regarded as behaving like
both an undulating wave and a stream of particles. “These two structural
properties simultaneously displayed by radiation,” he declared at the
end of his talk, “should not be considered as mutually
incompatible.”45</p>
<p>It was the first well-conceived promulgation of the wave-particle
duality of light, and it had implications as profound as Einstein’s
earlier theoretical breakthroughs. “Is it possible to combine energy
quanta and the wave principles of radiation?” he merrily wrote to a
physicist friend. “Appearances are against it, but the Almighty—it
seems—managed the trick.”46</p>
<p>A vibrant discussion followed Einstein’s speech, led by Planck
himself. Still unwilling to embrace the physical reality underlying the
mathematical constant that he had devised nine years earlier, or to
accept the revolutionary ramifications envisioned by Einstein, Planck
now played protector of the old order. He admitted that radiation
involved discrete “quanta, which are to be conceived as atoms of
action.” But he insisted that these quanta existed only as part of the
process of radiation being emitted or absorbed. “The question is where
to look for these quanta,” he said. “According to Mr. Einstein, it would
be necessary to conceive that free radiation in a vacuum, and thus the
light waves themselves consist of atomistic quanta, and hence force us
to give up Maxwell’s equations. This seems to me a step that is not yet
necessary.”47</p>
<p>Within two decades, Einstein would assume a similar role as protector
of the old order. Indeed, he was already looking for ways out of the
eerie dilemmas raised by quantum theory. “I am very hopeful that I will
solve the radiation problem, and that I will do so without light
quanta,” he wrote a young physicist he was working with.48</p>
<p>It was all too mystifying, at least for the time being. So as he
moved up the professorial ranks in the German-speaking universities of
Europe, he turned his attention back to the topic that was uniquely his
own, relativity, and for a while became a refugee from the wonderland of
the quanta. As he lamented to a friend, “The more successes the quantum
theory enjoys, the sillier it looks.”49</p>
