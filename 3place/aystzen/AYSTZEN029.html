BRAIN AND EINSTEIN’S MIND</h4>
<p>Einstein’s study, as he left it</p>
<p>When Sir Isaac Newton died, his body lay in state in the Jerusalem
chamber of Westminster Abbey, and his pallbearers included the lord high
chancellor, two dukes, and three earls. Einstein could have had a
similar funeral, glittering with dignitaries from around the world.
Instead, in accordance with his wishes, he was cremated in Trenton on
the afternoon that he died, before most of the world had heard the news.
There were only twelve people at the crematorium, including Hans Albert
Einstein, Helen Dukas, Otto Nathan, and four members of the Bucky
family. Nathan recited a few lines from Goethe, and then took Einstein’s
ashes to the nearby Delaware River, where they were scattered.1</p>
<p>“No other man contributed so much to the vast expansion of 20th
century knowledge,” President Eisenhower declared. “Yet no other man was
more modest in the possession of the power that is knowledge, more sure
that power without wisdom is deadly.” The New York Times ran nine
stories plus an editorial about his death the next day: “Man stands on
this diminutive earth, gazes at the myriad stars and upon billowing
oceans and tossing trees—and wonders. What does it all mean? How did it
come about? The most thoughtful wonderer who appeared among us in three
centuries has passed on in the person of Albert Einstein.”2</p>
<p>Einstein had insisted that his ashes be scattered so that his final
resting place would not become the subject of morbid veneration. But
there was one part of his body that was not cremated. In a drama that
would seem farcical were it not so macabre, Einstein’s brain ended up
being, for more than four decades, a wandering relic.3</p>
<p>Hours after Einstein’s death, what was supposed to be a routine
autopsy was performed by the pathologist at Princeton Hospital,Thomas
Harvey, a small-town Quaker with a sweet disposition and rather dreamy
approach to life and death. As a distraught Otto Nathan watched
silently, Harvey removed and inspected each of Einstein’s major organs,
ending by using an electric saw to cut through his skull and remove his
brain. When he stitched the body back up, he decided, without asking
permission, to embalm Einstein’s brain and keep it.</p>
<p>The next morning, in a fifth-grade class at a Princeton school, the
teacher asked her students what news they had heard. “Einstein died,”
said one girl, eager to be the first to come up with that piece of
information. But she quickly found herself topped by a usually quiet boy
who sat in the back of the class. “My dad’s got his brain,” he
said.4</p>
<p>Nathan was horrified when he found out, as was Einstein’s family.
Hans Albert called the hospital to complain, but Harvey insisted that
there may be scientific value to studying the brain. Einstein would have
wanted that, he said. The son, unsure what legal and practical rights he
now had in this matter, reluctantly went along.5</p>
<p>Soon Harvey was besieged by those who wanted Einstein’s brain or a
piece of it. He was summoned to Washington to meet with officials of the
U.S. Army’s pathology unit, but despite their requests he refused to
show them his prized possession. Guarding it had become a mission. He
finally decided to have friends at the University of Pennsylvania turn
part of it into microscopic slides, and so he put Einstein’s brain, now
chopped into pieces, into two glass cookie jars and drove it there in
the back of his Ford.</p>
<p>Over the years, in a process that was at once guileless as well as
bizarre, Harvey would send off slides or chunks of the remaining brain
to random researchers who struck his fancy. He demanded no rigorous
studies, and for years none were published. In the meantime, he quit
Princeton Hospital, left his wife, remarried a couple of times, and
moved around from New Jersey to Missouri to Kansas, often leaving no
forwarding address, the remaining fragments of Einstein’s brain always
with him.</p>
<p>Every now and then, a reporter would stumble across the story and
track Harvey down, causing a minor media flurry. Steven Levy, then of
New Jersey Monthly and later of Newsweek, found him in 1978 in Wichita,
where he pulled a Mason jar of Einstein’s brain chunks from a box
labeled “Costa Cider” in the corner of his office behind a red plastic
picnic cooler.6 Twenty years later, Harvey was tracked down again, by
Michael Paterniti, a free-spirited and soulful writer for Harper’s, who
turned his road trip in a rented Buick across America with Harvey and
the brain into an award-winning article and best-selling book, Driving
Mr. Albert.</p>
<p>Their destination was California, where they paid a call on
Einstein’s granddaughter, Evelyn Einstein. She was divorced, marginally
employed, and struggling with poverty. Harvey’s perambulations with the
brain struck her as creepy, but she had a particular interest in one
secret it might hold. She was the adopted daughter of Hans Albert and
his wife Frieda, but the timing and circumstances of her birth were
murky. She had heard rumors that made her suspect that possibly, just
possibly, she might actually be Einstein’s own daughter. She had been
born after Elsa’s death, when Einstein was spending time with a variety
of women. Perhaps she had been the result of one of those liaisons, and
he had arranged for her to be adopted by Hans Albert. Working with
Robert Schulmann, an early editor of the Einstein papers, she hoped to
see what could be learned by studying the DNA from Einstein’s brain.
Unfortunately, it turned out that the way Harvey had embalmed the brain
made it impossible to extract usable DNA. And so her questions were
never answered.7</p>
<p>In 1998, after forty-three years as the wandering guardian of
Einstein’s brain, Thomas Harvey, by then 86, decided it was time to pass
on the responsibility. So he called the person who currently held his
old job as pathologist at Princeton Hospital and went by to drop it
off.8</p>
<p>Of the dozens of people to whom Harvey doled out pieces of Einstein’s
brain over the years, only three published significant scientific
studies. The first was by a Berkeley team led by Marian Diamond.9 It
reported that one area of Einstein’s brain, part of the parietal cortex,
had a higher ratio of what are known as glial cells to neurons. This
could, the authors said, indicate that the neurons used and needed more
energy.</p>
<p>One problem with this study was that his 76-year-old brain was
compared to eleven others from men who had died at an average age of 64.
There were no other geniuses in the sample to help determine if the
findings fit a pattern. There was also a more fundamental problem: with
no ability to trace the development of the brain over a lifetime, it was
unclear which physical attributes might be the cause of greater
intelligence and which might instead be the effect of years spent using
and exercising certain parts of the brain.</p>
<p>A second paper, published in 1996, suggested that Einstein’s cerebral
cortex was thinner than in five other sample brains, and the density of
his neurons was greater. Once again, the sample was small and evidence
of any pattern was sketchy.</p>
<p>The most cited paper was done in 1999 by Professor Sandra Witelson
and a team at McMaster University in Ontario. Harvey had sent her a fax,
unprompted, offering samples for study. He was in his eighties, but he
personally drove up to Canada by himself, transporting a hunk that
amounted to about one-fifth of Einstein’s brain, including the parietal
lobe.</p>
<p>When compared to brains of thirty-five other men, Einstein’s had a
much shorter groove in one area of his inferior parietal lobe, which is
thought to be key to mathematical and spatial thinking. His brain was
also 15 percent wider in this region. The paper speculated that these
traits may have produced richer and more integrated brain circuits in
this region.10</p>
<p>But any true understanding of Einstein’s imagination and intuition
will not come from poking around at his patterns of glia and grooves.
The relevant question was how his mind worked, not his brain.</p>
<p>The explanation that Einstein himself most often gave for his mental
accomplishments was his curiosity. As he put it near the end of his
life, “I have no special talents, I am only passionately curious.”11</p>
<p>That trait is perhaps the best place to begin when sifting through
the elements of his genius. There he is, as a young boy sick in bed,
trying to figure out why the compass needle points north. Most of us can
recall seeing such needles swing into place, but few of us pursue with
passion the question of how a magnetic field might work, how fast it
might propagate, how it could possibly interact with matter.</p>
<p>What would it be like to race alongside a light beam? If we are
moving through curved space the way a beetle moves across a curved leaf,
how would we notice it? What does it mean to say that two events are
simultaneous? Curiosity, in Einstein’s case, came not just from a desire
to question the mysterious. More important, it came from a childlike
sense of marvel that propelled him to question the familiar, those
concepts that, as he once said, “the ordinary adult never bothers his
head about.”12</p>
<p>He could look at well-known facts and pluck out insights that had
escaped the notice of others. Ever since Newton, for example, scientists
had known that inertial mass was equivalent to gravitational mass. But
Einstein saw that this meant that there was an equivalence between
gravity and acceleration that would unlock an explanation of the
universe.13</p>
<p>A tenet of Einstein’s faith was that nature was not cluttered with
extraneous attributes. Thus, there must be a purpose to curiosity. For
Einstein, it existed because it created minds that question, which
produced an appreciation for the universe that he equated with religious
feelings. “Curiosity has its own reason for existing,” he once
explained. “One cannot help but be in awe when one contemplates the
mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of
reality.”14</p>
<p>From his earliest days, Einstein’s curiosity and imagination were
expressed mainly through visual thinking—mental pictures and thought
experiments—rather than verbally. This included the ability to visualize
the physical reality that was painted by the brush strokes of
mathematics. “Behind a formula he immediately saw the physical content,
while for us it only remained an abstract formula,” said one of his
first students.15 Planck came up with the concept of the quanta, which
he viewed as mainly a mathematical contrivance, but it took Einstein to
understand their physical reality. Lorentz came up with mathematical
transformations that described bodies in motion, but it took Einstein to
create a new theory of relativity based on them.</p>
<p>One day during the 1930s, Einstein invited Saint-John Perse to
Princeton to find out how the poet worked. “How does the idea of a poem
come?” Einstein asked. The poet spoke of the role played by intuition
and imagination. “It’s the same for a man of science,” Einstein
responded with delight. “It is a sudden illumination, almost a rapture.
Later, to be sure, intelligence analyzes and experiments confirm or
invalidate the intuition. But initially there is a great forward leap of
the imagination.”16</p>
<p>There was an aesthetic to Einstein’s thinking, a sense of beauty. And
one component to beauty, he felt, was simplicity. He had echoed Newton’s
dictum “Nature is pleased with simplicity” in the creed he declared at
Oxford the year he left Europe for America: “Nature is the realization
of the simplest conceivable mathematical ideas.”17</p>
<p>Despite Occam’s razor and other philosophical maxims along these
lines, there is no self-evident reason this has to be true. Just as it
is possible that God might actually play dice, so too it is possible
that he might delight in Byzantine complexities. But Einstein didn’t
think so. “In building a theory, his approach had something in common
with that of an artist,” said Nathan Rosen, his assistant in the 1930s.
“He would aim for simplicity and beauty, and beauty for him was, after
all, essentially simplicity.”18</p>
<p>He became like a gardener weeding a flower bed. “I believe what
allowed Einstein to achieve so much was primarily a moral quality,” said
physicist Lee Smolin. “He simply cared far more than most of his
colleagues that the laws of physics have to explain everything in nature
coherently and consistently.”19</p>
<p>Einstein’s instinct for unification was ingrained in his personality
and reflected in his politics. Just as he sought a unified theory in
science that could govern the cosmos, so he sought one in politics that
could govern the planet, one that would overcome the anarchy of
unfettered nationalism through a world federalism based on universal
principles.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of his personality was his
willingness to be a nonconformist. It was an attitude that he celebrated
in a foreword he wrote near the end of his life to a new edition of
Galileo. “The theme that I recognize in Galileo’s work,” he said, “is
the passionate fight against any kind of dogma based on
authority.”20</p>
<p>Planck and Poincaré and Lorentz all came close to some of the
breakthroughs Einstein made in 1905. But they were a little too confined
by dogma based on authority. Einstein alone among them was rebellious
enough to throw out conventional thinking that had defined science for
centuries.</p>
<p>This joyous nonconformity made him recoil from the sight of Prussian
soldiers marching in lockstep. It was a personal outlook that became a
political one as well. He bristled at all forms of tyranny over free
minds, from Nazism to Stalinism to McCarthyism.</p>
<p>Einstein’s fundamental creed was that freedom was the lifeblood of
creativity. “The development of science and of the creative activities
of the spirit,” he said, “requires a freedom that consists in the
independence of thought from the restrictions of authoritarian and
social prejudice.” Nurturing that should be the fundamental role of
government, he felt, and the mission of education.21</p>
<p>There was a simple set of formulas that defined Einstein’s outlook.
Creativity required being willing not to conform. That required
nurturing free minds and free spirits, which in turn required “a spirit
of tolerance.” And the underpinning of tolerance was humility—the belief
that no one had the right to impose ideas and beliefs on others.</p>
<p>The world has seen a lot of impudent geniuses. What made Einstein
special was that his mind and soul were tempered by this humility. He
could be serenely self-confident in his lonely course yet also humbly
awed by the beauty of nature’s handiwork. “A spirit is manifest in the
laws of the universe—a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in
the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble,” he wrote.
“In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a
special sort.”22</p>
<p>For some people, miracles serve as evidence of God’s existence. For
Einstein it was the absence of miracles that reflected divine
providence. The fact that the cosmos is comprehensible, that it follows
laws, is worthy of awe. This is the defining quality of a “God who
reveals himself in the harmony of all that exists.”23</p>
<p>Einstein considered this feeling of reverence, this cosmic religion,
to be the wellspring of all true art and science. It was what guided
him. “When I am judging a theory,” he said, “I ask myself whether, if I
were God, I would have arranged the world in such a way.”24 It is also
what graced him with his beautiful mix of confidence and awe.</p>
<p>He was a loner with an intimate bond to humanity, a rebel who was
suffused with reverence. And thus it was that an imaginative,
impertinent patent clerk became the mind reader of the creator of the
cosmos, the locksmith of the mysteries of the atom and the universe.</p>
