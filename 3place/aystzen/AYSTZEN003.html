<h4 id="main-characters">MAIN CHARACTERS</h4>
<p>MICHELE ANGELO BESSO (1873–1955). Einstein’s closest friend. An
engaging but unfocused engineer, he met Einstein in Zurich, then
followed him to work at the Bern patent office. Served as a sounding
board for the 1905 special relativity paper. Married Anna Winteler,
sister of Einstein’s first girlfriend.</p>
<p>NIELS BOHR (1885–1962). Danish pioneer of quantum theory. At Solvay
conferences and subsequent intellectual trysts, he parried Einstein’s
enthusiastic challenges to his Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
mechanics.</p>
<p>MAX BORN (1882–1970). German physicist and mathematician. Engaged in
a brilliant, intimate correspondence with Einstein for forty years.
Tried to convince Einstein to be comfortable with quantum mechanics; his
wife, Hedwig, challenged Einstein on personal issues.</p>
<p>HELEN DUKAS (1896–1982). Einstein’s loyal secretary, Cerberus-like
guard, and housemate from 1928 until his death, and after that protector
of his legacy and papers.</p>
<p>ARTHUR STANLEY EDDINGTON (1882–1944). British astrophysicist and
champion of relativity whose 1919 eclipse observations dramatically
confirmed Einstein’s prediction of how much gravity bends light.</p>
<p>PAUL EHRENFEST (1880–1933). Austrian-born physicist, intense and
insecure, who bonded with Einstein on a visit to Prague in 1912 and
became a professor in Leiden, where he frequently hosted Einstein.</p>
<p>EDUARD EINSTEIN (1910–1965). Second son of Mileva Mari and Einstein.
Smart and artistic, he obsessed about Freud and hoped to be a
psychiatrist, but he succumbed to his own schizophrenic demons in his
twenties and was institutionalized in Switzerland for much of the rest
of his life.</p>
<p>ELSA EINSTEIN (1876–1936). Einstein’s first cousin, second wife.
Mother of Margot and Ilse Einstein from her first marriage to textile
merchant Max Löwenthal. She and her daughters reverted to her maiden
name, Einstein, after her 1908 divorce. Married Einstein in 1919.
Smarter than she pretended to be, she knew how to handle him.</p>
<p>HANS ALBERT EINSTEIN (1904–1973). First son of Mileva Mari and
Einstein, a difficult role that he handled with grace. Studied
engineering at Zurich Polytechnic. Married Frieda Knecht (1895–1958) in
1927. They had two sons, Bernard (1930–) and Klaus (1932–1938), and an
adopted daughter, Evelyn (1941–). Moved to the United States in 1938 and
eventually became a professor of hydraulic engineering at Berkeley.
After Frieda’s death, married Elizabeth Roboz (1904–1995) in 1959.
Bernard has five children, the only known great-grandchildren of Albert
Einstein.</p>
<p>HERMANN EINSTEIN (1847–1902). Einstein’s father, from a Jewish family
from rural Swabia. With his brother Jakob, he ran electrical companies
in Munich and then Italy, but not very successfully.</p>
<p>ILSE EINSTEIN (1897–1934). Daughter of Elsa Einstein from her first
marriage. Dallied with adventurous physician Georg Nicolai and in 1924
married literary journalist Rudolph Kayser, who later wrote a book on
Einstein using the pseudonym Anton Reiser.</p>
<p>LIESERL EINSTEIN (1902–?). Premarital daughter of Einstein and Mileva
Mari. Einstein probably never saw her. Likely left in her Serbian
mother’s hometown of Novi Sad for adoption and may have died of scarlet
fever in late 1903.</p>
<p>MARGOT EINSTEIN (1899–1986). Daughter of Elsa Einstein from her first
marriage. A shy sculptor. Married Russian Dimitri Marianoff in 1930; no
children. He later wrote a book on Einstein. She divorced him in 1937,
moved in with Einstein at Princeton, and remained at 112 Mercer Street
until her death.</p>
<p>MARIA “MAJA” EINSTEIN (1881–1951). Einstein’s only sibling, and among
his closest confidantes. Married Paul Winteler, had no children, and in
1938 moved without him from Italy to Princeton to live with her
brother.</p>
<p>PAULINE KOCH EINSTEIN (1858–1920). Einstein’s strong-willed and
practical mother. Daughter of a prosperous Jewish grain dealer from
Württemberg. Married Hermann Einstein in 1876.</p>
<p>ABRAHAM FLEXNER (1866–1959). American education reformer. Founded the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and recruited Einstein
there.</p>
<p>PHILIPP FRANK (1884–1966). Austrian physicist. Succeeded his friend
Einstein at German University of Prague and later wrote a book about
him.</p>
<p>MARCEL GROSSMANN (1878–1936). Diligent classmate at Zurich
Polytechnic who took math notes for Einstein and then helped him get a
job in the patent office. As professor of descriptive geometry at the
Polytechnic, guided Einstein to the math he needed for general
relativity.</p>
<p>FRITZ HABER (1868–1934). German chemist and gas warfare pioneer who
helped recruit Einstein to Berlin and mediated between him and Mari. A
Jew who converted to Christianity in an attempt to be a good German, he
preached to Einstein the virtues of assimilation, until the Nazis came
to power.</p>
<p>CONRAD HABICHT (1876–1958). Mathematician and amateur inventor,
member of the “Olympia Academy” discussion trio in Bern, and recipient
of two famous 1905 letters from Einstein heralding forthcoming
papers.</p>
<p>WERNER HEISENBERG (1901–1976). German physicist. A pioneer of quantum
mechanics, he formulated the uncertainty principle that Einstein spent
years resisting.</p>
<p>DAVID HILBERT (1862–1943). German mathematician who in 1915 raced
Einstein to discover the mathematical equations for general
relativity.</p>
<p>BANESH HOFFMANN (1906–1986). Mathematician and physicist who
collaborated with Einstein in Princeton and later wrote a book about
him.</p>
<p>PHILIPP LENARD (1862–1947). Hungarian-German physicist whose
experimental observations on the photoelectric effect were explained by
Einstein in his 1905 light quanta paper. Became an anti-Semite, Nazi,
and Einstein hater.</p>
<p>HENDRIK ANTOON LORENTZ (1853–1928). Genial and wise Dutch physicist
whose theories paved the way for special relativity. Became a father
figure to Einstein.</p>
<p>MILEVA MARI (1875–1948). Serbian physics student at Zurich
Polytechnic who became Einstein’s first wife. Mother of Hans Albert,
Eduard, and Lieserl. Passionate and driven, but also brooding and
increasingly gloomy, she triumphed over many, but not all, of the
obstacles that then faced an aspiring female physicist. Separated from
Einstein in 1914, divorced in 1919.</p>
<p>ROBERT ANDREWS MILLIKAN (1868–1953). American experimental physicist
who confirmed Einstein’s law of the photoelectric effect and recruited
him to be a visiting scholar at Caltech.</p>
<p>HERMANN MINKOWSKI (1864–1909). Taught Einstein math at the Zurich
Polytechnic, referred to him as a “lazy dog,” and devised a mathematical
formulation of special relativity in terms of four-dimensional
spacetime.</p>
<p>GEORG FRIEDRICH NICOLAI, born Lewinstein (1874–1964). Physician,
pacifist, charismatic adventurer, and seducer. A friend and doctor of
Elsa Einstein and probable lover of her daughter Ilse, he wrote a
pacifist tract with Einstein in 1915.</p>
<p>ABRAHAM PAIS (1918–2000). Dutch-born theoretical physicist who became
a colleague of Einstein in Princeton and wrote a scientific biography of
him.</p>
<p>MAX PLANCK (1858–1947). Prussian theoretical physicist who was an
early patron of Einstein and helped recruit him to Berlin. His
conservative instincts, both in life and in physics, made him a contrast
to Einstein, but they remained warm and loyal colleagues until the Nazis
took power.</p>
<p>ERWIN SCHRÖDINGER (1887–1961). Austrian theoretical physicist who was
a pioneer of quantum mechanics but joined Einstein in expressing
discomfort with the uncertainties and probabilities at its core.</p>
<p>MAURICE SOLOVINE (1875–1958). Romanian philosophy student in Bern who
founded the “Olympia Academy” with Einstein and Habicht. Became
Einstein’s French publisher and lifelong correspondent.</p>
<p>LEÓ SZILÁRD (1898–1964). Hungarian-born physicist, charming and
eccentric, who met Einstein in Berlin and patented a refrigerator with
him. Conceived the nuclear chain reaction and cowrote the 1939 letter
Einstein sent to President Franklin Roosevelt urging attention to the
possibility of an atomic bomb.</p>
<p>CHAIM WEIZMANN (1874–1952). Russian-born chemist who emigrated to
England and became president of the World Zionist Organization. In 1921,
he brought Einstein to America for the first time, using him as the draw
for a fund-raising tour. Was first president of Israel, a post offered
upon his death to Einstein.</p>
<p>THE WINTELER FAMILY. Einstein boarded with them while he was a
student in Aarau, Switzerland. Jost Winteler was his history and Greek
teacher; his wife, Rosa, became a surrogate mother. Of their seven
children, Marie became Einstein’s first girlfriend; Anna married
Einstein’s best friend, Michele Besso; and Paul married Einstein’s
sister, Maja.</p>
