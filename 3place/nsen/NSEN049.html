<h4 id="chapter-forty-seven">Chapter Forty-Seven</h4>
<p>“You’re sure you only want me here the first time you try this?” I
ask Sawyer two days later as we stand in the middle of the flight field
with Tairn, Andarna, and Sliseag at four thirty a.m. “I’m not exactly
the best one to catch you if this goes poorly.”</p>
<p>He tightens the straps on his pack. “No, but you’re the only one I
want seeing if I fall on my ass.”</p>
<p>“Or going for help if you break your leg?”</p>
<p>A small smile plays across his mouth. “Let’s hope that doesn’t
happen.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to talk about this?” I gesture to Sliseag.</p>
<p>“Thanks, but I’ve been talking to Jesinia. I’m ready. I need you for
the more practical side of…this.” He nods toward Sliseag, then crouches
down, then pulls a lever on the inside of his prosthesis. A flat,
two-inch-wide piece of metal with a curved end pops out of the toe of
his boot. “And it’s not my first time. I need a second opinion because
it didn’t go so well for me yesterday.”</p>
<p>“You made that?” It’s pretty damned cool.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” He stands, then stares at Sliseag’s left front leg. The Red
Swordtail is smaller than Sgaeyl, but his talons are still enormous
given what Sawyer’s about to try. “His scale pattern in this one row
doesn’t overlap.” He points upward. “And in theory, the hook should just
catch the top of each scale as I climb, but I can’t get there without
fall—”</p>
<p>Sliseag lifts his head over us and breathes out a huff of steam that
I’m going to have to wipe off my goggles.</p>
<p>Ugh. It’s too early to be sticky.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t talking about you,” Sawyer argues. “It’s not like we
haven’t discussed the scale pattern, and you don’t have to—”</p>
<p>Sliseag steams us again, the heat stinging my face. If he gets it any
hotter, he’s going to blister my skin.</p>
<p>Tairn stalks forward and tilts his head at Sliseag in a way I never
want to see aimed at me, and Andarna is quick to follow.</p>
<p>“Because I don’t want you to have to!” Sawyer shouts up at Sliseag,
who narrows his eyes.</p>
<p>This would be a really ridiculous way to die.</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t dare,” Tairn warns.</p>
<p>“Just let me try it,” Sawyer argues.</p>
<p>Sliseag bares his teeth.</p>
<p>Sawyer bares his right back.</p>
<p>“I will never understand the relationships other riders have with
their dragons,” I say down the bond. I barely understand my own, but
giving Andarna a wide berth seems to be working, since she’s here. Not
that she could stay behind for the length of our rotation, but I’m
declaring it a victory.</p>
<p>“You’re not supposed to,” Tairn remarks.</p>
<p>“Here we go.” Sawyer rolls his shoulders, then runs toward Sliseag’s
claw.</p>
<p>He makes it two steps before the tip of his boot catches in the mud
and he falls forward.</p>
<p>Shit. I lunge for his pack and grab hold with both hands, yanking
Sawyer upright before he yucks a set of flight leathers. My shoulders
both pop, but the joints have the decency not to subluxate on me.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Sawyer mutters, staring at the boot. “See?”</p>
<p>“I do.” I crouch to peer at the device. “Can you kick the lever
open?”</p>
<p>“In theory,” he answers. “But it’s probably a little small for that,
and I don’t have time to make changes before movement today.”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s try it as it is. You can modify in Aretia. None of us
want you to stay behind.” Mud squishes under my boots as I stand. “You
can run, right?”</p>
<p>Sawyer nods. “I wouldn’t try this if I couldn’t. My gait is off
because I can’t quite get the flex right, and I’m just not nimble enough
to run the full length of his leg like I used to.”</p>
<p>“We can work with that.” I nod. “How about you run just like you’d
mount before, and right when you feel your momentum shift, like you’re
about to fall back, kick the lever open. It should catch your foot just
like you designed it to, and you climb the rest of the way.”</p>
<p>Sawyer looks down at me. “That’s how you did the Gauntlet, isn’t
it?”</p>
<p>“Kind of. I waited until I felt my weight shift backward, then
stabbed a dagger into the wood and pulled myself up. But I somehow doubt
Sliseag would be appreciative of that approach.” A corner of my mouth
lifts.</p>
<p>Sliseag huffs another breath—this time without steam—as if in
agreement.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it a shot.” Sawyer pops the lever closed, then nods to
himself. “Here we go.” He takes off running, and Sliseag flexes his
talons, flattening his claw. Sawyer’s long legs eat up the first half
dozen feet of the climb, and I hold my breath when his progress
stalls.</p>
<p>He kicks the lever, then clings to Sliseag’s leg about halfway up,
his foot scraping the scales for a place to grip for a heart-stopping
second before it catches.</p>
<p>“You’ve got it!” I shout. “Climb!”</p>
<p>His left boot holds steady, working as he’d designed, but his right
slips, leaving a streak of mud down Sliseag’s red scales.</p>
<p>My chest clenches as he tries again, then again, with the same
result.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” he yells, then lays his forehead against Sliseag’s leg.</p>
<p>“I can flatten the tip of my tail and boost him,” Andarna offers,
having crept closer.</p>
<p>Now my ribs tighten for a whole different reason. It’s the first
positive thing she’s said since our return.</p>
<p>“That’s an honorable offer,” I tell her, then repeat it to
Sawyer.</p>
<p>“No!” he shouts. “Thank you, but no.”</p>
<p>Sliseag rumbles low in his chest, and I stand there helplessly,
knowing there’s nothing I can do.</p>
<p>“Because it’s not the same,” Sawyer argues, frustration rumbling
through his tone and I know he isn’t talking to me. “You’re the one who
took a risk on me, and I won’t ask you to dishonor…” He falls quiet.</p>
<p>“Is that how you feel when you dip your shoulder for me?” I ask
Tairn. “Dishonored?”</p>
<p>“I am the second-largest dragon on the Continent and a revered
warrior. My tales are legendary. My mate unparalleled. My feats
unmatched—”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t change my question.” I cut him off before he starts to list
his accolades.</p>
<p>“It would take a great deal more than a change of posture to dishonor
me,” he replies.</p>
<p>“But you never had to lower yourself before me, did you? Not for
Naolin, or—”</p>
<p>“We do not speak of the one who came before.” Agonizing pain floods
the bond, and I immediately regret my choice of words.</p>
<p>Andarna lifts her head and narrows her accusing golden eyes at
me.</p>
<p>“I know.” I put my hands up in the universal sign of surrender.</p>
<p>“You know that’s not how I feel about it,” Sawyer says as his arms
start to tremble. “We’ve been over this! Any rider would have done the
same in my position.” He shakes his head and reaches for the next scale,
then pulls himself upward, gaining a foot of hard-fought distance. “Of
course I don’t blame you! That’s not—” His head whips sideways, toward
Sliseag’s. “No, I’m not punishing— For Amari’s sake, will you just let
me get a word in?”</p>
<p>From the silence that follows, Sliseag does not comply.</p>
<p>I shift my weight as my pack grows heavier by the minute, and my
lower spine stops whining and starts shouting.</p>
<p>“Because my leg was and still is worth your life!” Sawyer snaps when
he can’t reach the joint of the next scale. “Of course you’re allowed to
feel the same—” His hand slides back to its previous hold. “Oh.”</p>
<p>Sliseag huffs, then extends his left leg, sliding his claw through
the mud. Slowly, it lowers to a walkable degree of incline.</p>
<p>My throat tightens as Sawyer lets go and slowly rises. He extends his
arms outward, like a cadet on Parapet, then trudges upward step by step
as I catch movement in my peripheral vision.</p>
<p>“Your year-mates arrive,” Tairn says.</p>
<p>I keep my eyes locked on Sawyer as he reaches the top of Sliseag’s
shoulder and lowers his arms. His next movements look like a routine
he’s performed thousands of times, and with a few quick steps, he finds
the seat.</p>
<p>Sliseag rises to his full height as Sawyer settles in, and I back
away for a better view.</p>
<p>“Looks like you’ve been up there a time or two,” I call to him as he
relaxes in the seat.</p>
<p>“Feels like I never left,” he shouts down with a grin. “I can
ride.”</p>
<p>“You can ride,” I agree, my smile instant and wide. “Now, does it
matter how you got there, or only that he chose you?”</p>
<p>“You know the answer to that already.” His smile softens.</p>
<p>“I do.” I nod, then turn to Andarna, narrowing the pathway to just
her. “Look at me.”</p>
<p>She spares me a glance.</p>
<p>“You can grieve.” If my words don’t work, maybe hers will.</p>
<p>Golden eyes lock on mine.</p>
<p>“You can grieve,” I repeat. “And when and if you’re ready to talk
about it, I’ll be here.”</p>
<p>“You do not talk about your grief,” she counters. “Neither does he.”
Her tail flicks in Tairn’s direction.</p>
<p>She has a point. “I’m getting there,” I say slowly. “And he’s not
perfect, either.”</p>
<p>Her nostrils flare and her scales shimmer to the purple-toned black
she usually prefers.</p>
<p>I nod and let the subject drop, but it definitely feels like
progress.</p>
<p>“Thank Amari,” Rhi whispers as she comes up on my left side, grinning
up at Sawyer.</p>
<p>“Sawyer! Look at you!” Ridoc runs forward, his arms up in
victory.</p>
<p>Sliseag swings his head and snaps his teeth shut a few feet in front
of Ridoc.</p>
<p>“Look at you from a distance!” Ridoc retreats, his arms still held
high. When he bumps into Maren, he turns and sweeps her into a hug as
she laughs.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t help,” Rhi says quietly as Sawyer focuses on
reacquainting himself with the seat. “Did I fail him?”</p>
<p>“No. You were exactly who he needed you to be.” I slip my arm through
hers. Fuck, this pack is heavy. “You’re our friend, but you’re also our
squad leader. He doesn’t want to fall in front of you; none of us do. We
want to make you proud. And I know you’re used to being responsible for
us, and you’re truly exceptional at your job…”</p>
<p>Ridoc puts Maren down, then reaches for Cat, who accepts his hug with
straight arms and an annoyed eye roll.</p>
<p>“But?” Rhi glances at me sideways.</p>
<p>“But you couldn’t have made this happen any faster.” We walk toward
the others. “Not you, or me, or Ridoc, or Jesinia. It was always down to
the two of them. It was only ever going to be on their timeline.”</p>
<p>Ridoc spins toward Neve, and the third-year flier looks at him like
he’s grown another set of eyeballs as she dodges his embrace and bumps
into Bragen. He whirls toward Imogen, who puts up her hand as she walks
by with Quinn.</p>
<p>“Don’t even think about it, Gamlyn,” she warns.</p>
<p>“You’re so warm and fuzzy!” Quinn says, slinging her arm around
Imogen’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“Only to you.” She looks up at Sawyer. “Nice to see you where you
belong, Henrick!”</p>
<p>Ridoc spins and throws his arms around Dain, who lifts his brows,
then slowly brings his hand up and pats Ridoc’s back twice in an awkward
exchange. “Looking good, Sawyer!” Dain calls up, then continues on
toward Cath.</p>
<p>“Good job, Matthias,” Bodhi says to Rhi as he walks by. “Got your
cadet back in the seat.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t—” she starts, and I squeeze her arm with mine. “He did it
himself, but we’re proud of him. Thank you, section leader.”</p>
<p>Bodhi nods with a smile that looks so close to Xaden’s my whole rib
cage draws tight. Neither Bodhi nor Dain had a chance to take the rune
course because of their duty schedules and our failed mission, so we get
them both on our rotation.</p>
<p>“Look at him!” Ridoc races our way and smooshes us in a hug. “All is
right with the world!” His arms slacken and he draws back, his gaze
soaked in apology. “I mean, other than what’s going on with
Riorson.”</p>
<p>“I know what you meant.” I shift my pack and force a smile. “And
hopefully, I’ll see him there.”</p>
<p>Hope stows away like a little windproof passenger as we launch for
Aretia, and somehow lives through the night when we make camp just
inside the Tyrrish border. Have to admit, it’s freeing to fly without
worry that we’re about to be spotted by a wyvern patrol or found by
Theophanie. Only once we’re sure the gryphons can still handle the
altitude after being gone for months do we start the final leg of the
trip, entering the lone protection of the Aretian wards.</p>
<p>Landing in the valley above Aretia that evening feels like coming
home, but Xaden isn’t here. Or Sgaeyl isn’t, which means the same
thing.</p>
<p>“This sucks,” I tell Tairn with a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>He growls in agreement.</p>
<p>Andarna snaps at Kaori when he walks a little too close over
Panchek’s blustering protest, then takes off after a herd of sheep as I
dismount from Tairn.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” the professor says, knitting his dark, slashing brows.
“I didn’t mean—”</p>
<p>“You did,” I interrupt. “And I sympathize with why you’ve come, but
she’s not going to let you study her. Not even here.”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Kaori nods, then looks around the high hanging valley
with its lush green foliage and snow-tipped peaks. “Selfishly, I also
wanted to see how this Empyrean functions. I suspect it’s why Panchek
has tagged along as well.”</p>
<p>A smile tugs at my mouth. “Good luck asking them.”</p>
<p>“You ready?” Rhiannon asks as she approaches with footsteps that
border on bouncing.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” I flat-out grin at my friend’s happiness. “Let’s get down
there so you can see your family.”</p>
<p>“I’d prefer we hold formation—” Dain starts as he comes up on my
right.</p>
<p>Rhiannon and I both level a look on him.</p>
<p>“—tomorrow morning,” he quickly corrects course. “Family first, and
all.”</p>
<p>“Family first,” Rhiannon agrees with a quick smile, and he passes by,
heading toward the rocky path down to the house. “I get that he has to
come for rune training, too, but why our squad?” Rhi whispers.</p>
<p>“Same reason I’m here.” Bodhi pops up on our left and lifts his face
to the sun like he’s greeting an old friend. “This is the best
squad.”</p>
<p>“I forgot how fucking hot this place is,” Ridoc says, unbuttoning his
flight jacket.</p>
<p>“It’s a hatching ground,” Rhiannon reminds him with a wide grin. “I
bet it’s almost the same temperature as the Vale with how many dragons
are here now.”</p>
<p>“We beat the storm, but I bet it lowers the temperature tomorrow.” I
flick the buttons open on my jacket, well aware I’ll be freezing the
second we cross the magical barrier that defines this territory as the
hatching grounds.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it’s glacial by the time we make it down to Riorson
House.</p>
<p>Gods, just the sight of it makes me miss him.</p>
<p>The squad files past the guards and through the front doors, into the
massive entryway that looks up five full stories set into the mountain
like giant steps. It’s quiet for this time of day. Or maybe it just
seems empty because the halls are no longer bustling with cadets.</p>
<p>Kaori turns around with a stunned look of disbelief.</p>
<p>Felix pats him on the back, then says something to Rhiannon before
leading Kaori away.</p>
<p>“Eyes on me!” Rhiannon’s voice echoes, earning everyone’s attention.
“Find your bunks as previously assigned. The night is yours to do what
you want, but formation is at seven tomorrow, so I’d think twice about
finding a tavern.”</p>
<p>We break and climb the first flight of stairs.</p>
<p>“Let’s get out of here as quickly as possible,” Rhi tells Maren just
ahead of me.</p>
<p>“I can’t wait to see my brothers.” Maren claps excitedly, light
catching on the long silver scar on the back of her hand. Pretty sure
there’s not a single one of us who has come through the last few years
unmarked in some way. “Cat, are you coming?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t mind seeing the little terrors,” she says with a nod as
we reach the landing.</p>
<p>“Vi?” Rhi asks over her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Sure,” I answer with a quick nod. “I love your family.”</p>
<p>“Sawyer and I are going, too.” Ridoc heads up to the third floor.</p>
<p>“All right,” Rhi calls up the stairs as she climbs. “Whoever wants to
go to my house, we meet in the foyer in forty minutes, which should give
you a chance to bathe and change. My mother will boot you out of her
house if you walk in smelling like sulfur, and I’m not even
kidding.”</p>
<p>I pause on the landing, my gaze flickering from the steps ahead to
the hallway on my left.</p>
<p>“Please don’t tell me you’re lost,” Bodhi says, coming up the steps
last.</p>
<p>“Of course not.” I shake my head slowly. “It’s just that I don’t have
a room here, and I’m not sure where I should sleep.”</p>
<p>He scoffs and gestures down the hall. “You have a room. It hasn’t
moved.”</p>
<p>“It’s his room,” I correct him quietly. “And he’s all broody.”</p>
<p>“We’re home, Vi. Act like it.” He grins, then turns around me,
walking backward down the hallway on the right. “Sleep in your bed.
He’ll just brood harder if you don’t.”</p>
<p>I sigh when he disappears into his room, and then turn left and head
to mine—ours.</p>
<p>The handle won’t turn, so I flick my wrist and picture the mechanism
opening, using lesser magic to unlock it.</p>
<p>Walking in is surreal. Magic tingles across my skin when I step
through the wards. It looks just like we left it in December, except
most of our things are now at Basgiath. After shutting the door, I swing
my pack from my shoulders and set it on the chair Xaden waited in for
all those days while I slept after being stabbed over Resson.</p>
<p>The bedding is the same dark blue, the curtains beside the massive
windows are open to the evening light, and every book in his collection
is exactly where it belongs on the built-in shelves to my right.</p>
<p>There are a few pitiful attempts at tempered runes on the desk, left
from my last lesson, along with a forgotten notebook in the top drawer.
I check the armoire and find one of my sweaters, a uniform for each of
us, and the blanket his mother made him tucked up in the right-hand
corner.</p>
<p>And gods, does it smell like him. My chest threatens to split
straight open at the sudden, acute stab of pure longing. I’ve left my
mark here, too. The bathing chamber still smells like the soap I use on
my hair, and I find the bar right where I left it. I take a few minutes
to clean up, then dress in a fresh uniform, half expecting Xaden to walk
in at any second and ask me about my day.</p>
<p>It’s almost like this room is removed from time itself, a tiny corner
of the world where we simultaneously live together yet don’t. The only
indication months have passed is the glass box from Zehyllna on his
nightstand, and the emerald-hilted Blade of Aretia resting within. It’s
missing a single stone near the top, but looks no worse for wear after
having been in Navarrian possession for six hundred years.</p>
<p>Someone knocks on the door, and I glance at the clock. Has it already
been forty minutes?</p>
<p>I swing open the door and find Brennan on the other side. His eyes
are tired, but his smile is bright as he gives me the standard sibling
once-over.</p>
<p>Can’t help it—I do it, too, coming away satisfied that he’s not
wearing any new scars.</p>
<p>“Pull me in.” He holds out his hand. “He fucked with the wards the
last time he was here.”</p>
<p>“Of course he did.” I grab my brother’s hand and pull him through. He
immediately yanks me into a hug.</p>
<p>I soak up the rare moment of peace until he steps back, having lost
his smile some time in the last ten seconds. “Do you need anything
mended?”</p>
<p>“No.” I shake my head.</p>
<p>“Are you sure? Because every time you show up here you’re an inch
from death.” He studies me like I might be lying.</p>
<p>“I’m sure.”</p>
<p>“Good.” He kicks the door closed. “Sound shield only works with the
door shut, right?”</p>
<p>“Right.” I retreat a few steps in apprehension. “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Brennan’s face falls, and he stares at the ground. “I can’t mend
him.”</p>
<p>“I have no idea who you’re talking about.” I lift my brows in utter
confusion. “We’re all healthy. No one was hurt on the way here.”</p>
<p>He looks up, and the sorrow in his eyes sends me staggering backward.
“Xaden. I can’t mend him, Vi. I tried every day that he was here last
week.”</p>
<p>I struggle to draw adequate breath. “You know.”</p>
<p>“I know.” He nods once. “He must be further along than Jack had been
when Nolon started working with him. I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>That unit of measurement is unfathomable. “Me too.”</p>
<p>“We tried silent offerings in every local temple, pushing magic back
into the earth, even sitting with the eggs in the hatching grounds.
We’ve tried everything either of us could think of, though the letter he
sent from Lewellen yesterday had a weird—” He looks at me like I’ve
grown horns. “Are you…smiling?”</p>
<p>“Yesterday?” I don’t even try to fight the hopeful little curve.</p>
<p>Brennan nods. “He wants to try mending the spot at Basgiath.”</p>
<p>“Good idea.” There’s nothing small about my grin now.</p>
<p>He might be broody, but he hasn’t given up.</p>
<p>472 AU, Willhaven, Braevick: With the exception of one house, the
village was desiccated overnight by a single venin estimated to be a
Sage. The only adult amongst the three survivors described her as,
“Astonishingly ageless. Hair as black as the day we married, but in
place of the age lines I’d expected were bulging scarlet veins branching
outward from her red-ringed eyes.”</p>
