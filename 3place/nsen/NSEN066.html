<h4 id="chapter-sixty-four">Chapter Sixty-Four</h4>
<p>VIOLET</p>
<p>I swear the tornado slows as Tairn battles the wind at the eastern
edge of the field, flying for the mountainside ahead of us.</p>
<p>“It is slowing,” Tairn agrees.</p>
<p>“She used it to get us here.” Theophanie’s holding it like a nocked
arrow, waiting for our arrival.</p>
<p>Trees are uprooted a mile to the left, turning into low-flying
projectiles that hurl across the field like cross-bolts. The tornado may
have slowed its progress, but it’s doing far more damage along the
way.</p>
<p>The wyvern launches ahead of us, moving our way, and for a split
second, I can’t help but wonder if I’ve just invited Malek to our
doorstep.</p>
<p>She’s a Maven, and I’m a cadet.</p>
<p>She wields storms with expert precision, and I need a conduit for my
lightning.</p>
<p>She’s already felled Tairn once before.</p>
<p>The smartest thing I could do is fly for the wards and save us
both—all four of us, considering Xaden and Sgaeyl—but I can’t leave
those people to die, even if it means we’re desiccated alongside
them.</p>
<p>Riders don’t run. We fight.</p>
<p>“Now, preferably,” Tairn remarks. “If you’re done accepting our
deaths.”</p>
<p>“Not accepting, just calculating.” I draw power through my charred
veins as the distance between us grows smaller and smaller, gripping the
conduit in my left hand and raising my right.</p>
<p>Energy rips through me as I release it, dragging the bolt downward
and letting go before it can blister my fingers. Lightning strikes as
Theophanie’s wyvern rolls to the right.</p>
<p>I missed. My stomach clenches.</p>
<p>“Again!” Tairn demands, banking right to follow her down as rain
turns to ice.</p>
<p>Hail hits in stones the size of peas, then cherries, hitting me with
the force of a thousand blunt arrows as wind tears at my face, but I
lift my hand—</p>
<p>The conduit shatters.</p>
<p>Glass slices into my palm, and I gasp in pain as blood wells.</p>
<p>No, no, no! I can’t aim without it.</p>
<p>“You have to!” Tairn orders as we spiral downward.</p>
<p>Right. Dying up here isn’t an option I’m willing to entertain, and
I’m not about to let her kill my friends—or Xaden, either. I quickly
undo the strap holding the jagged remnants to my wrist and let what’s
left of the orb, and the fist-size chunk of ice that destroyed it, fall
away. My hope plummets with it.</p>
<p>I’ll have to kill her just like I did those wyvern—with volume. I
unsheathe my last alloy-hilted dagger and grasp it with my bleeding hand
so I’m ready for anything, lift my right hand, and wield again.</p>
<p>I miss as she rolls in the opposite direction and begins to climb. We
follow, and I draw power again and again, but it becomes harder with
every strike. She avoids every single one as we fly along the mountain,
hugging the terrain. Tairn surges with sweeping beats of his wings,
gaining on her.</p>
<p>Heat singes my lungs, then burns, then fries, until I feel nothing
but fire and rage.</p>
<p>Rock flies as I hit the ridgeline to the right, missing her by ten
feet as we fly into the sun.</p>
<p>The sun.</p>
<p>I jerk my head left. The tornado has stalled midway toward the city,
and the sky above us is clear all the way to the east.</p>
<p>“She’s killing the storm to make it harder for me to wield!” That
explains why I’m burning hotter than before. I jerk my focus back to our
prey before it can wander toward the city I’m desperately fighting to
save.</p>
<p>“Do not take more than you can channel,” Tairn warns as he lunges
forward. His teeth snap closed a few feet behind the wyvern’s tail.</p>
<p>They’re too fucking fast.</p>
<p>The wyvern dives, curving along the ridgeline to the right, and Tairn
follows.</p>
<p>A roar of unfettered agony fills my head, so loud it vibrates my
bones and shrill enough to pop my ears.</p>
<p>“Sgaeyl!” Tairn bellows, his wings losing their rhythm, and my heart
skips a series of beats.</p>
<p>Oh Malek, no.</p>
<p>I hurl myself at the bond, but the wall of ice doesn’t just stand
firm; it repels me with brute force. Dread nails my stomach to the floor
as we lose speed—</p>
<p>I hear the snap a second before the shadow falls over us. No, not a
shadow. A massive net with weights the size of desks attached along the
edges.</p>
<p>Tairn roars and banks left, but it’s no use.</p>
<p>“Tairn!” I scream as the net hits, smashing my torso downward onto
the pommels and covering every scale I can see. He’d be able to bear the
weight of it easily on his torso, but it smothers his wings, and the
weights… Oh gods. “Tuck your wings or they’ll break!”</p>
<p>His roar of indignation shakes the rocks loose from the mountainside,
but he snaps them closed, tangling in the net.</p>
<p>And we fall.</p>
<p>“Prepare yourself!” Tairn warns as the mountain flies by in a
blur.</p>
<p>Andarna. Xaden. Sgaeyl. Mira. Brennan. My friends. They slip through
my mind in a whirl of pictures I can’t grasp on to, flickering too fast
to fully feel. All I can do is ease off the pommels, lean right to spare
the inevitable impact to my abdomen as the thick rope of the net digs
into my back.</p>
<p>“You have been the gift of my life,” I tell Tairn.</p>
<p>“It is not over!” he shouts.</p>
<p>We hit with a jarring impact, bone crunching against rock, and my
left arm snaps and the dagger falls.</p>
<p>A scream forces its way through my lips as we slide down the
mountain…just like the first time we encountered Theophanie. The sound
of claws scraping over stone consumes my existence as I fight to block
out the pain, and Tairn swings his body weight so we skid headfirst
through the trees in an endless, terrifying plunge.</p>
<p>I keep my head down to avoid any low-hanging branches as something
digs painfully into my ribs, and eventually our momentum slows.</p>
<p>Holy shit, we just might survive the fall.</p>
<p>“Of course we’ll survive!” Tairn growls.</p>
<p>“Are you hurt?” I ask Tairn as we come to a stop at what appears to
be the edge of the forest.</p>
<p>“Nothing that won’t heal after we free ourselves and separate her
sinew from bone.” The scent of sulfur fills the air as Tairn breathes
fire through the net.</p>
<p>Wood crackles and net thwangs. Then he surges forward and the net
slips just enough for me to sit up through the opening that’s clearly
designed to hold dragons, not riders.</p>
<p>“We have to get to Sgaeyl.” Which means getting him free, but it will
take too long to cut through these ropes with the runed daggers I have.
And even if I do, I’ll still have to wield to kill her without my
alloy-hilted one, and I’m already edging burnout. My arm throbs
mercilessly, and every breath I take scalds my lungs.</p>
<p>“Sgaeyl can handle herself,” Tairn grits out, but bowstring-tight
tension and worry radiate down the bond as fire streams again and he
fights to get us loose. “And the dark wielder descends ahead.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, Theophanie’s wyvern glides down toward the field like
they have all the time in the world, like we’re pinned exactly where she
wants us.</p>
<p>Gods, she’s relentless. It doesn’t matter that my arm throbs with
excruciating intensity—we have to get out of here right fucking now.
Time to use the runes I brought in case of an emergency and pray I
tempered them correctly, because this is definitely a crisis.</p>
<p>“We have to get out from under this thing.” Cradling my left arm to
my chest, I twist for my pack, but something pushes into my ribs as I
dig into the bag one-handed. I discard the ones I don’t need, then snag
the one for softening surfaces and shove it up against the rope. Here’s
hoping it’s right.</p>
<p>Magic ripples, and the fibers stretch and give way.</p>
<p>My eyebrows rise. It works.</p>
<p>“Rip what you can!” I shout to Tairn.</p>
<p>“Stay seated so we can fly,” he orders, shredding the net on the
edges of his spikes, and I take the opportunity to grab whatever’s
jabbing me in my pocket. Aaric’s package. I catch the hastily scrawled
message on the edge of the package I’d missed when Sloane handed it to
me.</p>
<p>For when you lose yours. Strike in the dark, Violet.</p>
<p>What the fuck? The fall has broken the wax seal, and the parchment
unrolls as I loosen my grip, dropping a carved piece of gray marble in
my lap—a ceremonial-looking dagger with familiar flame-shaped etchings
along the hilt. I glance at the accompanying note from the high
priestess of Dunne’s temple in Aretia, but the letters blur as the pain
in my arm flares and Tairn thrashes to free us.</p>
<p>A gift from one servant of Dunne to another. I must warn you—only
those touched by the gods should wield their wrath. I will pray to Her
that she need not use it to avoid reacquainting herself with the other
who curries her favor. Her path is still not set.</p>
<p>My stomach pitches. How would Aaric know I’d lose my dagger, let
alone think that some piece of rock could replace—</p>
<p>“Ahead of us!” Tairn snaps, and I jerk my attention forward and
sheathe the marble dagger out of instinct.</p>
<p>Theophanie stalks toward us from the tree line, her hair fraying from
its braid, and there’s nothing patient or amused on her face.</p>
<p>I frantically scan what sky I can see. Theophanie’s wyvern waits in
the field beyond the trees, and the only other wings I find are locked
in battle over Draithus in the distance, which hopefully means she’s
alone.</p>
<p>“How much time do you need to free yourself?” I ask Tairn, wrenching
the buckle of my saddle free and climbing through the hole in the net.
Pain shoots up my left arm, but I pretend it belongs to someone else and
keep going. Pain doesn’t matter if you’re dead.</p>
<p>“Moments,” Tairn shouts. “Do not—”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to let her kill you like a trussed pig!” I retort,
fear and wrath fueling me as I scramble for his shoulder, struggling to
keep my arm stable until he stills. He must have thrown his claws out
before the net hit, because his forelegs are already extended,
bracketing his lower jaw.</p>
<p>I draw a runed dagger, then slide down, dragging the edge of the
blade along his leg as I go. The blade won’t cut scale, but the net
falls apart in its wake.</p>
<p>“Brought low by a net?” Theophanie mocks, striding toward us. “How
easy it was to catch the pair of them.”</p>
<p>The pair? The scream.</p>
<p>“They have Sgaeyl, too.” Tairn’s rage washes over me like acid.</p>
<p>I put myself in front of Tairn and open the floodgates to his power,
welcoming the scorch of heat and flame in my blistered veins.</p>
<p>“Silver One,” Tairn growls in warning to the accompaniment of the
sound of shredding rope.</p>
<p>“If I burn out, so be it, but she won’t touch you,” I say aloud just
so Theophanie will know I’m not fucking around.</p>
<p>“Have you made your choice, then?” Theophanie asks, coming closer by
the step.</p>
<p>“I have.” I flick my right hand skyward and let the energy snap
through me, yanking it down with the tip of my finger.</p>
<p>Theophanie races ten yards to the right, moving faster than I’ve ever
seen. “You’ll have to be—”</p>
<p>I wield again before she can finish and strike the very place she’s
standing, earning an immediate clap of thunder.</p>
<p>But she’s already twenty feet to my left.</p>
<p>“Faster,” she finishes, and I strike again, only for the pattern to
repeat.</p>
<p>Again and again and again.</p>
<p>My lungs scream as I breathe the very thing I’ve become, heat and
power and rage, but she’s still too fast for me to catch and moving
closer to Tairn with every failed strike.</p>
<p>“Almost there,” he assures as ropes snap behind me.</p>
<p>I need to throw her off her game now.</p>
<p>I hold my next strike when she appears twenty feet ahead. “Tell me,
do you miss Unnbriel?”</p>
<p>Her eyes flare, and she startles.</p>
<p>Victory. I gather more and more power, spooling it like molten
thread. “Do you not yearn for temple?” I use the words the high
priestess had on me.</p>
<p>Her face twists with an emotion that almost looks like longing, but
it’s quickly masked with anger. “Do you?” she counters. “Or are you
immune, having only been touched, but not dedicated?” She charges
forward. “Do you know the pain of never being allowed to return, of
knowing that it would sever the very thing that’s kept me untouchable
all these years?”</p>
<p>I let a fraction of my power release, striking the ground in front of
her, and she skids to a halt. Touched. Shit, the priestess in Unnbriel
had said that, too. So had the note wrapped around Aaric’s gift. “As a
high priestess, you would have had immeasurable power on the isle. How
was it still not enough?”</p>
<p>“Why serve a god when you can be one?” Theophanie snarls.</p>
<p>Putrid fear consumes the bond, followed by another roar that nearly
buckles my knees.</p>
<p>Sgaeyl. My head jerks upward, my heart lurching against the cage of
my ribs as Tairn snarls, his talons furrowing in the forest floor.
“Don’t!” Terror clogs my throat as I shout for Xaden, but he can’t hear
me.</p>
<p>Draithus is enveloped in darkness, and the shrieking cries of wyvern
soon follow, racing across the field and echoing off the rock above.</p>
<p>“What—” Theophanie pivots toward the noise.</p>
<p>Shadow spreads like a ripple on a lake, devouring the field in the
fury of an onyx storm and sweeping toward us at a speed that squeezes
the hope from my chest, then outright shatters my heart. The pain hits
like a physical blow to the center of my chest.</p>
<p>He’s terrifyingly powerful with Sgaeyl, but not like this.</p>
<p>This is the kind of force that ends worlds.</p>
<p>And it’s almost here.</p>
<p>“I love you,” I whisper down the bond, and the ice cracks, but it’s
not enough to halt the approaching wave of darkness.</p>
<p>Shadow throws Theophanie to the ground a second before it rushes over
me, whisper soft against my cheeks, tossing us into pitch-black
night.</p>
<p>“Strike!” Tairn snaps, and I hear the net give way.</p>
<p>Exhaustion grabs hold and refuses to be ignored. I’m too tired. Too
close to burning alive. What’s the point if I can’t catch her?</p>
<p>“Use the darkness!” Tairn orders.</p>
<p>My heart stutters. Use the very thing that’s taking Xaden from me? I
never dreamed that taking every possible path to cure him would lead to
his choice. The fire devouring me from the inside out threatens to
consume my very bones, and for a second, I debate letting it. I couldn’t
stop my mother, and I can’t stop Xaden. I can’t save him.</p>
<p>Wait. Strike in the darkness. That’s what Aaric’s note said…</p>
<p>Like he knew this would happen.</p>
<p>I gasp as all the pieces click in one overwhelming heartbeat. The
reinforcements. Telling me to guard Dunne’s temple. Yanking Lynx out of
the way before the doors even opened to the great hall. He knew. He’s
been manifesting this entire time.</p>
<p>“He’s a fucking precog,” I whisper in awe. A real one—not like
Melgren, who can only foresee battles. If Aaric wields true
precognition, he saw this, and he gave me a weapon made of the fractured
temple—a temple Theophanie can’t step inside. I don’t believe in
oracles, but I do believe in signets.</p>
<p>I unsheathe the marble dagger with my right hand, then mix my pain
into the searing power that scorches what’s left of my beating heart,
lift my broken arm, and release the agonizing burn of energy
skyward.</p>
<p>And hold it.</p>
<p>The continuous strike lights up our surroundings and branches out
through the shadow, revealing Theophanie’s back. She stumbles to her
feet and whirls toward me, her eyes flaring wide, and she dives left,
smacking into an invisible wall and falling backward.</p>
<p>A wall that snarls.</p>
<p>Scales shimmer to the same silver-blue as my strike, and a small
dragon stalks toward Theophanie, her head low, teeth bared.</p>
<p>And just like that, my stammering heartbeat stabilizes.</p>
<p>Andarna.</p>
<p>Theophanie reaches out her hand, wonder lighting her red eyes.</p>
<p>I don’t care what her intentions are—she’s not getting her hands on
Andarna. Pain wraps me in a broiling vise and fire sears my lungs, but I
hold the bolt and sprint. Andarna leaving was one thing; losing her to
the touch of a dark wielder is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>“Irid,” Theophanie whispers with reverence, straining toward Andarna.
I lunge, driving the dagger straight into her heart. Fire breathes
through me, until I am char and cinder and agony.</p>
<p>She staggers backward and starts to laugh.</p>
<p>Then she sees the blood and stops. “How?” Her eyes flare, and she
topples to her knees. “Stone doesn’t kill venin.”</p>
<p>“You were never just venin,” I reply. “Dunne is a wrathful goddess to
high priestesses who turn their backs on Her.”</p>
<p>She opens her mouth to scream, then desiccates in an instant.</p>
<p>I release the bolt, plunging us into darkness and surrendering to the
fire burning me alive.</p>
<p>“Violet,” Andarna whispers.</p>
<p>And then I hear nothing.</p>
<p>The only thing more unpredictable than the volatile province</p>
<p>that is Tyrrendor is her duke. There is a reason reigning</p>
<p>aristocracy should never wear black.</p>
