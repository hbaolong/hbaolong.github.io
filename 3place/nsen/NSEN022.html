<h4 id="chapter-twenty">Chapter Twenty</h4>
<p>Upon our return, I spend a few days reading every single book on
Deverelli Jesinia can find to prepare for my progress briefing with the
Senarium. Between those, classes, the tomes Queen Maraya sends at my
request, modifying my saddle, and the hours I spend wielding on the
snow-capped peaks above Basgiath, I fall into bed exhausted every single
night.</p>
<p>By the time Friday arrives, I’ve devoured The Dark Side of Magic, Red
Regalia, The Scourge of our Times, and the nightmare-inducing A Study in
the Anatomy of the Enemy, none of which brings me the answers I need for
Xaden.</p>
<p>Neither does Jack. He’s all too happy to tell me about asim
progression, how channeling from the earth happens as easily as
breathing beyond the wards, but he won’t give up the name of his Sage or
give me anything other than trivial information about them. And he’s
sure as Malek not telling me how Theophanie knew we’d go for the citrine
or what answers I’m searching for.</p>
<p>But once I finally make my way through my dad’s manuscript for the
third time and scour the research that behemoth requires, I have an
inkling of a thought of where he might have been headed in his
hypothesis. I keep it to myself, partially because I’m scared to be
wrong but mostly because I’m terrified I’m right. When Varrish mentioned
last year that he thought the research dealt with feathertails, I never
imagined it would lead in this direction.</p>
<p>“I want to go,” Ridoc says as we walk down the plush red carpet of
the administration building, headed for the great hall.</p>
<p>I search for the right words and try to quell the vat of nausea that
is my stomach. Presenting to Halden is bad enough, but I skipped
breakfast knowing the entire Senarium waits for me, most likely to
assign a new commander.</p>
<p>And I’m not accepting one.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to happen,” Rhi says with a sigh from his other side.
“She’s going to have a fight on her hands as it is, and they won’t let
you miss class, anyway. They’re not even letting us in that room.”</p>
<p>“I can keep you safe,” he insists, turning to me, an unpeeled orange
in his hands.</p>
<p>“Pretty sure Riorson will keep her safe,” Sawyer notes, walking on
Rhi’s right with the help of his crutches and his latest metal
prosthetic leg. He’s even rejoined classes this week, though he has yet
to make it to the flight field.</p>
<p>“And Mira.” I’m taking Dad’s letter to heart.</p>
<p>A foursome of infantry cadets steps aside so we can pass, and the
massive double doors to the great hall come into view. Cat stands near
the threshold, smiling up at a tall flier I’ve never seen before.</p>
<p>He looks to be a couple of inches shorter than Xaden, with a lean
build and a quick smile. His hair is as dark as Cat’s, reflecting the
same blue mage light that catches on the hilt of the blade he carries at
his side and the V of daggers sheathed at his chest.</p>
<p>My eyebrows rise. I figured when I asked her to join this meeting
with someone she trusts, she’d choose Maren, but I’m all for her moving
on if it means she’s going to stop staring at Xaden constantly. Though I
kind of hoped Trager had a shot with her.</p>
<p>“Hey, will you just try?” Ridoc’s voice doesn’t only tense up, it
rises, causing all dozen people in the hallway to glance our way.</p>
<p>“What’s this really about?” I reach for his upper arm, and the four
of us pause ten feet shy of the door.</p>
<p>“I just…need to go.” He looks away and grips the orange in both
hands. “One of us needs to go with you. Ever since…” Pain flashes
through his dark-brown eyes as he brings his gaze back to mine. “Ever
since Athebyne, one of us has been by your side.” He lifts his finger.
“Except the time you snuck out on your little siblings-only trip to
Cordyn. The school splits, and we go with you. Basgiath falls under
attack, and we’re there. Heading into Poromiel for Maren’s brothers?
It’s us. We get separated, and you either get dragged into an
interrogation chamber and tortured for days or nearly roasted by Aura’s
fire, and I know I can’t be the only one who thought, if Liam had been
here, keeping watch over you, it never would have happened.” He swings
that finger toward Rhiannon and Sawyer. “You both know it crossed your
minds.”</p>
<p>A lump grows in my throat. “I appreciate it, I do. But I don’t need
anyone keeping watch over me.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean it that way.” He covers the orange with both hands. “I
just think bad things happen when we aren’t together. Rhi can’t go—she
has an entire squad to lead—and Sawyer is still recovering, which leaves
me. And if Riorson had been a hundred percent sure of his ability to
keep bad things from happening, he wouldn’t have assigned Liam to our
squad in the first place. The guy is powerful, but he’s not
infallible.”</p>
<p>If he only knew the truth. Gods know who they have waiting behind
these doors to replace the ones we lost, but I’m already sure I can only
trust two of them—Mira and Xaden.</p>
<p>“And you are?” Sawyer asks, leaning on his crutches.</p>
<p>Ridoc’s eyes narrow. “I’m just as good of a fighter as any of you,
and while you’ve been focused on rehab and Rhiannon is chasing
first-years to keep them in line, I’ve been the one reading every
fucking book Jesinia shoves at me and spending extra hours training—”
The skin on the orange splits. “It really pisses me off when you guys
act like my sense of humor somehow lessens my ability to show up for our
squad.”</p>
<p>“Ridoc,” I whisper, staring at the orange. “What did you do?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to tell you.” He hands me the fruit, and it
immediately chills my hands. “You aren’t the only one who’s been
spending hours honing their signet.”</p>
<p>Using my thumb, I peel back the rind. The fruit of the orange is
frozen solid beneath it. “How did you do it?”</p>
<p>“I’ve always been able to draw water out of the air,” he says. “Plus,
I get bored waiting for Sawyer to wake up when he rests—no offense—and
if there’s one thing healers are good at, it’s leaving fruit lying
around. I realized I could freeze the water in the fruit.”</p>
<p>My lips part as my mind spins through the implications.</p>
<p>“Sorrengail, are we going in or what?” Cat yells from down the
hall.</p>
<p>I look up at Ridoc and whisper, “Are you trying to tell me that you
can freeze the water in someone’s body?”</p>
<p>He rubs the back of his neck. “I mean, I haven’t tried it out on
anyone, or anything living, of course, but…yeah, I think so.”</p>
<p>Well, that’s unsettling. And glorious. And horrific. All of the
above, really.</p>
<p>“Holy shit, man.” Sawyer moves in closer. “Can other ice wielders do
that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so?” Ridoc shakes his head. “Turns out there’s only a
few of us who can even pull the water from the air.”</p>
<p>“Sorrengail!” Cat snaps.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re coming with me.” I push the orange into Ridoc’s hand,
then motion toward the door. “Though it has nothing to do with the
ice—there’s no magic where we’re headed—and everything to do with the
first point you made.”</p>
<p>“Bad things happen when we’re not together,” he says quietly.</p>
<p>Only go to war with those you trust implicitly.</p>
<p>I nod, and we head down the hallway.</p>
<p>“It’s about time.” Cat rolls her eyes, but her friend opens the door
on the right, and I catch a quick glimpse of his name tag as we walk in.
Cordella.</p>
<p>Her cousin?</p>
<p>Half the tables and benches in the hall have been pushed to the
sides, leaving an open space in front of the long center table, where
the members of the Senarium sit facing us, and they’re not alone. Aetos
and Markham flank Halden, who sits in the center of the group, listening
to whatever lies Markham whispers.</p>
<p>Xaden occupies the left end of the table, his chair turned toward me,
his legs outstretched as if this meeting determines the flight schedule
and not the future of the Continent, his eyes locked on me.</p>
<p>“You all right?” I ask, my gaze flickering toward Halden.</p>
<p>“He’s still breathing, so I’d consider that a win,” Xaden answers,
looking rather bored, but the shadows around him have sharp edges that
contrast the blurred ones down the table, the natural result of multiple
light sources. “They’re set on their course, so you’d better determine
ours.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Cadet Sorrengail.” Halden’s smile lights up his eyes, and he
leans away from Markham. “Right on time.”</p>
<p>“Actually, we’re missing someone.” I glance around the room, noting
that for once in her life, Mira’s late. It’s also impossible to miss
Foley, Henson, and Pugh sitting farther down the table—all that’s left
of our task force—and one addition: Captain Jarrett.</p>
<p>“As I see it, there are two extras in the room.” The Duchess of
Morraine shoots a disdainful look over my shoulder.</p>
<p>“They’re here at my request.” I lift my chin. “As is Cadet
Gamlyn.”</p>
<p>Ridoc stays silent at my side.</p>
<p>“You can’t be serious—” the duchess starts.</p>
<p>“I’ll allow it,” Halden says, lifting his hand. “Recent losses have
been regrettable, but a month has passed and it’s time to act. You have
the citrine, and a meeting has been set with King Courtlyn. Command is
being transferred to Captain Henson.” Halden gestures to the rolled
parchment in front of him.</p>
<p>“Is he fucking serious?” I glance at Xaden.</p>
<p>“Entirely.” A corner of his mouth lifts. “Have fun eating them
alive.”</p>
<p>I cross the freshly mopped floor and take the scroll, then step back
so I’m in line with Ridoc and give my orders a quick read. We will leave
for Deverelli the day after tomorrow, meet with the king to try to
negotiate an alliance, secure a foothold for expanding the search if we
don’t find Andarna’s kind there, then report back, all under the command
of Captain Henson and executive officer Lieutenant Pugh.</p>
<p>While Markham and Melgren search Aretia for any clues we have
missed.</p>
<p>“Did you read this?” It takes all I have not to crush the orders.
“They want to search Aretia.”</p>
<p>“They can get fucked.”</p>
<p>“No,” I say to Halden.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry?” Halden leans forward.</p>
<p>“I said no.” I rip the orders in half. “No to your commander. No to
your selections. No to searching Aretia. No.”</p>
<p>“I warned you,” Xaden says down the table.</p>
<p>Halden stiffens, and the Duke of Calldyr shifts in his seat before
narrowing his eyes on me. “Captain Jarrett is an excellent addition and
the best swordsman we have among the riders.”</p>
<p>“That’s overly generous, considering I watched Lieutenant Riorson
kick his ass without even trying a few months ago at Samara.” Power
ripples through my veins, but I keep my anger at a simmer. “We tried it
your way—”</p>
<p>“And clearly succeeded,” Halden counters. “Or are you not in
possession of the artifact?”</p>
<p>“We lost two riders out there because you saddled me with a squad
full of people who don’t know or trust one another. Yes, I have the
artifact, and I’ll take it to Deverelli, but only with a squad of my
choosing.” I hold my shoulders straight and catch Ridoc nodding out of
the corner of my eye.</p>
<p>The door opens behind us, and the familiar rhythm of quick, efficient
steps bolsters my courage toward pure audacity.</p>
<p>“Sorry I’m late,” Mira says, bypassing Cat and her cousin to stand at
my right. “Hell of a headwind out of the north. What did I miss?”</p>
<p>“I think Violet is about to lose her shit,” Ridoc whispers.</p>
<p>“This”—I toss the halves of the scroll at Halden, and he catches them
with the same reflexes that make him lethal on the battlefield—“is not
the plan, and they”—I gesture toward the seated riders—“are not my
squad.”</p>
<p>Xaden’s smirk deepens, and he settles into his seat like he’s ready
for a show.</p>
<p>“Searching Aretia is the first logical course of action, considering
it is the only area we have no information on—” Markham starts, his
cheeks leaning toward ruddy.</p>
<p>“You don’t speak,” I snap, meeting his gaze for the first time in
months. “Not to me. As far as I’m concerned, you have the credibility of
a drunkard and the integrity of a rat. You dare complain about missing
six years of information on Aretia when you’ve hidden centuries of our
continent’s history from public knowledge?”</p>
<p>Halden’s brows rise, and Mira shifts her hand to the pommel of her
sword.</p>
<p>“You cannot speak to a superior officer, let alone the commander of a
quadrant, with such disrespect!” Markham roars, coming out of his
chair.</p>
<p>“In case you missed it when I crossed the parapet, I am not in your
chain of command,” I fire back.</p>
<p>“But you are in mine,” Aetos warns. “And I speak with the authority
of Melgren.”</p>
<p>Fury gets the best of me. “And I speak with the authority of Tairn,
Andarna, and the Empyrean. Or did you forget that two dragons also lost
their riders?”</p>
<p>“If I wasn’t in love with you already, I would be now,” Xaden says,
crossing his ankles.</p>
<p>“Sit, Markham,” Halden orders, a note of surprise in his tone. “You
tried and failed.”</p>
<p>Markham sinks into his chair.</p>
<p>“We’ll give this one shot. Name your squad for the Deverelli mission,
Cadet Sorrengail,” Halden says. “But know that if you fail, we’ll assign
another commander, and refusing to continue will negate the terms of the
Second Aretia Accord.”</p>
<p>The one that gave Xaden back his title.</p>
<p>I swallow the lump in my throat. No pressure or anything.</p>
<p>“Accepted.” I straighten my shoulders. “For the Deverelli mission, my
squad will consist of Lieutenant Riorson, Lieutenant Sorrengail, Cadet
Gamlyn, Cadet Cordella”—I glance back over my shoulder to get his
rank—“Captain Cordella, Cadet Aetos, Prince Halden, and whatever
favorite guard follows you in case you stub your toe,” I say to Halden.
“When we succeed, I reserve the right to switch out members after the
first expedition.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not.” Aetos shakes his head. “You’ll take only
commissioned officers, no fliers, and Riorson is out of the
question.”</p>
<p>Halden lifts his hand, and Aetos quiets.</p>
<p>Xaden stills to the point I have to glance to see if he’s
breathing.</p>
<p>“I’ll take whomever I wish,” I counter. “As third in line for the
throne, Catriona’s capable of speaking for Poromiel—”</p>
<p>“And the captain?” the Duchess of Morraine asks, her face twisting
like she’s scented something sour. “You need two fliers?”</p>
<p>“Cadet Cordella deserves to have someone she trusts, too.” I tilt my
head at Halden. “Dragons don’t carry humans who haven’t crossed the
parapet or climbed the Gauntlet, so you’re lucky gryphons are kinder in
this regard, or you’d never keep up. Lieutenant Sorrengail is the only
rider capable of creating her own wards. Cadet Aetos is the only rider I
trust who speaks fluent Krovlish—which is the second most common
language used in Deverelli. Cadet Gamlyn is dedicated to my personal
safety, and even if Lieutenant Riorson weren’t the deadliest rider in
the whole of our forces”—I glance at Aetos, then Halden—“which he is,
you know Tairn and Sgaeyl cannot be separated, and there’s no telling
how long we’ll be forced to travel. I’m tired of arguing this
point.”</p>
<p>“He’s a professor at this war college,” Aetos sputters.</p>
<p>“He is my choice.”</p>
<p>Halden sits back in his chair and looks at me like he’s never seen me
before.</p>
<p>“He hasn’t,” Tairn reminds me. “He no longer knows you.”</p>
<p>I stare straight at Halden. “And the Tyrrish kept contact with
Deverelli up until the last century. Who better to reopen those lines of
communication than the Duke of Tyrrendor himself?”</p>
<p>Xaden’s surprise barrels down the bond, but he remains unnaturally
still.</p>
<p>“You may read my father’s book whenever you want,” I tell him.</p>
<p>“Riorson holds a seat in the Senarium,” the Duchess of Morraine
argues. “He can’t just leave. He doesn’t even have an heir
should…tragedy befall, though I might be persuaded to agree to his
absence should he consider my daughter’s proposal.”</p>
<p>“Proposal?” The blood runs from my face.</p>
<p>“One of about a dozen since they gave me the title back. Nothing to
stress over.” A soft strand of shimmering onyx brushes against my
mind.</p>
<p>My heart lurches. We have very different ideas of stress.</p>
<p>“At least say what you mean, Ilene.” Halden sends a sideways glance
her way. “You don’t trust him and would like to see your bloodline in
not only Morraine but Tyrrendor.”</p>
<p>“He led a rebellion!” She slams her hands on the tabletop.</p>
<p>“My father led a rebellion,” Xaden says without taking his eyes off
me. “I took part in a revolution. There’s a difference in the words,
from what I’m told.”</p>
<p>I catch my mouth curving.</p>
<p>“Besides, arguing makes no difference.” Xaden sits up. “I’m going.
Lewellen will speak for me in my absence while taking counsel from my
only living blood relative—Cadet Durran. Lieutenant Tavis has been
co-leading my classes and will step into the role of professor to teach
them fully while we’re gone until it’s time for the next professor to
rotate in.”</p>
<p>“If I give my permission,” Halden retorts.</p>
<p>Wrong move, Halden.</p>
<p>“I ask permission of one person on the Continent, and it sure as
Amari isn’t you.” Xaden slowly turns his head to look down the table at
Halden, and breathing becomes irritatingly difficult.</p>
<p>“I speak in my father’s stead,” Halden bites out through gritted
teeth.</p>
<p>“Right. Because he’s the one I defer to.” Xaden’s gaze swings to me.
“When would you like to go?”</p>
<p>“We fly for Deverelli as soon as His Highness is ready.” I look
Halden straight in the eye, counting on his absolute inability to read
my face or sense the fear that he’ll retaliate against Xaden with the
power of the crown.</p>
<p>Halden stands, as does everyone at the table except Xaden. “Let’s at
least keep that part of the orders intact. We depart the day after
tomorrow.” He leaves through the northern door, followed by everyone who
stood.</p>
<p>“No snide remarks,” I say to Ridoc with a quick smile. “I’m proud of
you.”</p>
<p>“I kept the inside thoughts inside,” he replies with a flash of a
grin as Xaden approaches.</p>
<p>“You really had to prick his temper?” I ask as he reaches us.</p>
<p>“No.” Xaden’s gaze flickers to my mouth. “I did that just for
fun.”</p>
<p>“Drake Cordella?” Mira shouts, and the three of us turn as she
charges across the room toward Drake. “As in the nightwing drift?”</p>
<p>He gives my sister a charming yet cocky smile. “You’ve heard of
me?”</p>
<p>“You were instrumental in bringing the wards down in the Montserrat
offensive last year.” Her eyes narrow.</p>
<p>“I was.” His grin expands.</p>
<p>She knees him straight in the groin.</p>
<p>Oh gods.</p>
<p>“Ooh.” Ridoc winces. “He’s going—”</p>
<p>Drake hits his knees, and Cat gasps.</p>
<p>“—down,” Ridoc finishes.</p>
<p>“You must be Mira Sorrengail,” Drake manages to say, pain etched in
every line of his face.</p>
<p>“Guess you’ve heard of me, too.” She crouches down to his level. “If
you ever endanger my sister’s life again, my blade will replace my knee.
Got it?”</p>
<p>To his credit, he lifts his head and sucks a breath in through his
teeth. “Heard.”</p>
<p>“Excellent.” She pats him on the shoulder and stands, dismissing Cat
with a glare before turning my way. “You get one chance to form your own
squad, and you choose your ex, your current lover, the quadrant’s
resident smart-ass, two people who have tried to kill you in the past
year—one over said current lover—and whatever Dain is? These are your
choices for the most important mission any rider could possibly
undertake?”</p>
<p>“I’m glad someone said it,” Tairn chimes in.</p>
<p>“And…you.” It’s not my finest comeback.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget Halden’s guard,” Ridoc adds. “I’m sure they’ll be super
useful.”</p>
<p>She flat-out rolls her eyes at him, then heads toward the door. “I’ll
need to provision here, but it looks like I’ll have time to read the
next volume in that series you love,” she says to me over her
shoulder.</p>
<p>Mom’s journals. I nod and soak up the victory for one sweet
second.</p>
<p>We could be only days away from having everything we need: Andarna’s
family, a cure for Xaden, and whatever it is my father wants me to
retrieve from that merchant in Deverelli.</p>
<p>The day after tomorrow can’t come fast enough.</p>
<p>Tyrrendor was the last to cut contact with the isles. The province
has a reputation for its cunning leadership, but in this case, I would
add: astute.</p>
