<h4 id="chapter-sixty-one">Chapter Sixty-One</h4>
<p>RHIANNON</p>
<p>Imogen. Quinn. Violet. My heart pounds. I don’t know how to protect
the pass when we’re down three of our most powerful, battle-hardened
squadmates, but failure isn’t an option.</p>
<p>Thank Zihnal, the infernal wind stopped. For a moment, I thought we’d
all be blown to Cordyn. I inspect what I can of the Medaro Pass from its
entrance and sigh with more than a little relief that none of the
civilians fell in the squall.</p>
<p>“The cliff blocked the wind for them, as it did us.” Feirge steps
away from the safety of the base and pivots sharply to face the winding
valley that leads to Draithus.</p>
<p>“Tell the others to form a line. If we can fly now, so can they.” A
horde of gray had just rounded the last curve of the valley when the
windstorm hit, driving the wyvern to land.</p>
<p>According to Cath, every dragon was forced to hunker down in
Draithus, too.</p>
<p>“Done,” Feirge responds, and rain splashes at the base of her
neck.</p>
<p>Great. Rain is the last thing anyone on this damned cliff needs.</p>
<p>I remind myself of what Raegan always says—Zihnal gives what he sees
fit. No use thanking the god for one blessing and cursing him in the
next breath. I’d like to see her say it under these circumstances, but
she’d probably pull it off. She’s always been the more graceful
twin.</p>
<p>Tara, on the other hand, would tell me to make my own luck.</p>
<p>I check right, making sure the others weren’t harmed in the freak
windstorm. Maren and Cat fall into line, and neither they nor their
gryphons look worse for wear. Beyond them, Sliseag swings his tail,
keeping his wings tucked for proximity, and Sawyer nods my way. Then I
look left and find Neve and Bragen both in position, with Aotrom
shifting his weight impatiently.</p>
<p>Ridoc stares at the northern peak, not the path through the valley
just south of it, like he could see straight through the thing if he
tried hard enough.</p>
<p>Part of me screams that we should be on the other side of that peak,
but we have our orders. And half a squad.</p>
<p>I clear my throat and my feelings. This isn’t the Squad Battle. I
make a mistake here, and innocent people die. We lucked out when the
wyvern that crashed through the holes I left in our defenses only took
out the wall and not my parents’ house. No matter how much Violet means
to me, she’s one life. We’re guarding thousands who are fleeing as my
family had, and we owe them the same protection.</p>
<p>“Gamlyn!” I shout across the gryphons. “I need your focus here.”</p>
<p>He looks like he might give me the finger for a second, but nods.</p>
<p>“Acknowledging your fear for the lightning wielder does not
compromise you.” Feirge calls me out just like always. “Ignoring it
does. Accept the emotion and move on.”</p>
<p>My grip tightens on the raised ridges of green scales that form the
pommel. “Of course I’m worried about Violet.” She’s out there in the one
condition I never want any of us—alone. Tairn flew into the cloud cover
moments before the windstorm hit, carrying Teine in chains and escorted
by Marbh, and the last status report from Cath had both Riorson and
Durran spotted near the city walls. At least I haven’t seen any
lightning. “But we have a job to—”</p>
<p>A dozen wyvern—maybe more—rise along the valley floor a few hundred
yards out. My heart begins pounding. “Ask Veirt how many Baylor can
see.”</p>
<p>Screams sound in a chorus from the evacuees, both those waiting to
climb and the ones already on the cliff. Rain. Wyvern. Panicked
civilians. The situation has real shitshow potential. Gods, the
first-years better be pulling the civilians to safety at the top of the
pass as instructed. Graycastle and Mairi are already on my lecture list.
Fuck knows what either of those two were thinking.</p>
<p>Undisciplined. I need to rein everyone in with a quickness.</p>
<p>“Baylor sees seventeen,” Feirge responds a second later.</p>
<p>Seventeen. Against three dragons and four gryphons. Shit. “That’s a
little menacing,” I admit to Feirge.</p>
<p>“Then let us be menaces,” Feirge snarls, her head weaving in
anticipation. “Ready to relay your orders.”</p>
<p>My orders. No pressure. We need to intercept.</p>
<p>“Riot, launch in a thorn formation,” I tell her. I learned my lesson
in Aretia—we have to engage far from the cliff. “Drift, guard the
evacuees under Bragen’s command.”</p>
<p>Feirge takes three steps, and I tighten my thighs to hold my seat as
she launches into the cloud-soaked sky. “Kiralair is disgruntled with
the decision.”</p>
<p>What else is new? I debate the choice for all the time it takes to
blink. “Tell Kira they have better maneuverability against the cliff
than we do and a full arsenal of runes. We can’t stop seventeen wyvern
with three dragons. They need to be ready.” Just once, I’d like to give
an order that Cat doesn’t feel the need to fight.</p>
<p>I settle my flight goggles over my eyes as we fly headfirst toward
the wyvern, Feirge, Aotrom, and Sliseag forming three points of a
triangle. We need to engage as far from the cliff as possible. Plenty of
room to move forward, not a lot of room to retreat against sheer
rock.</p>
<p>The enemy are roughly arranged in three columns, two deep.</p>
<p>“Continue thorn—” Wait. “No, vertical. Switch to vertical formation.”
It will give us the best shot at taking down as many as possible.</p>
<p>“Second-guessing your choices makes me do the same regarding
Threshing,” Feirge lectures, climbing in altitude as we approach the
steep walls of the valley.</p>
<p>“Very funny.” I wish I could see directly beneath us.</p>
<p>“They’re in position.” Feirge answers my unspoken question, but I
have a feeling Aotrom is going to deviate as soon as he gets the
chance.</p>
<p>“Check in with Sliseag.” We’ve got less than thirty seconds, and this
will only be his second encounter after nearly losing Sawyer at
Basgiath.</p>
<p>“He’s insulted you asked,” Feirge responds.</p>
<p>“Naturally.” I lock the toes of my boots between her scales and make
ready for impact once I can see the shape of their teeth. “Top center
first.”</p>
<p>“I thought we’d go bottom left,” she replies with mock innocence.</p>
<p>“No time for your sarcasm.”</p>
<p>Our target screeches, then climbs out of formation. Feirge breaks
away to pursue, and my whole body clenches as a stream of blue fire
erupts in our direction.</p>
<p>“Hold!” Feirge shouts, and I do exactly as she orders, locking my
muscles as she rolls right. My body weight shifts, and I push with my
right leg to balance out as she pulls a near-vertical climb.</p>
<p>“You’re going to do the thing, aren’t you?” I hold on to the pommel
like a lifeline as our momentum stalls at the zenith she’s chosen.</p>
<p>“Maybe.” She pitches back left, falling into a dive so steep my
stomach tries to dig its way out through my feet.</p>
<p>“You have to warn me!” I shift my grip and push at the pommel,
readying myself for what inevitably comes next as we barrel toward the
wyvern from above.</p>
<p>“Why? You were prepared.” She soft-snaps her wings, slowing our
descent a second before we make impact just enough that I won’t go
hurtling over her head.</p>
<p>The collision shakes my grip, and the rain isn’t helping.</p>
<p>Feirge digs her claws into the wyvern’s back and clamps her jaw at
the base of its skull, where the neck is thinner, weaker. Its scream
rattles my eardrums.</p>
<p>Then we fall, despite the frantic beat of Feirge’s wings. Fear rears
its ugly head, and I try to swallow it. She has the advantage of being
clear of the wyvern’s claws and teeth, but agility has always been her
biggest asset, not strength. Her claws shred through the leathery gray
wings, then she breaks their bones as the mountain rises to my
right.</p>
<p>“Getting close to the ground!” I warn her.</p>
<p>“Your situational awareness never fails to leave me awestruck.” She
heaves her weight forward, then wrenches the wyvern’s head back,
snapping its neck as a blur of gray flickers through my line of
sight.</p>
<p>“In that case, would you like to know about the one above us?” I
ask.</p>
<p>She releases the wyvern into the mountainside below, and both our
heads snap upward.</p>
<p>Aotrom flies by in pursuit, and a curl of green fire rushes up his
tail. I cease breathing until the brown outruns the flame, saving Ridoc
from a painful death, and then I face the source.</p>
<p>“Hold,” Feirge warns a second before we collide with the greenfire
wyvern. She snaps for its neck, taking a bloody chunk away as it dives,
spraying blood over the mountainside.</p>
<p>She sinks her claws into another and dissects its throat.</p>
<p>Where is the rest of the squad? I search with a quick swing of my
head and find Aotrom flying vertically alongside the other wyvern above
us. My mouth drops as he rolls, putting his spine—and Ridoc—against the
creature.</p>
<p>“What in Malek’s name is he doing?” I shout as Ridoc claps the pommel
with one hand and extends the other toward gray scales. Is he trying to
get himself crushed? He can’t be seriously—</p>
<p>He is.</p>
<p>The wyvern shrieks, and a paler shade of gray spreads along its
scales, emanating from Ridoc’s hand. The beast tenses, then ceases to
beat its wings…and falls directly toward us.</p>
<p>Feirge surges forward, banking left to avoid the ridgeline, and I
turn in the seat to watch the wyvern impact the rocky terrain. Holy
shit, I think it cracked in half.</p>
<p>“Did you see that?” I ask as we round the corner of the mountain,
finding Sawyer finishing a kill hundreds of feet below us. We need to
regroup. If it’s this hectic back here, how outnumbered are they beyond
the valley in Draithus?</p>
<p>I glance up at the sky and, in a moment of weakness, scan for any
sign of Tairn. How long can Vi be out there by herself?</p>
<p>“Focus.” Feirge’s head swivels toward the pass, and I put my head
where it belongs.</p>
<p>Shit. Seven of the wyvern got through. Cat has one by the throat,
Kira’s talons tearing into the spaces between scales as it lies
immobilized beneath her, while Maren takes aim at another with her
crossbow. A second later, its wing is on fire. Impressive rune.</p>
<p>Bragen and Neve each chase their own up the cliffside, leaving four
to pick off screaming civilians one by one.</p>
<p>“Regroup,” I order, determined to save as many as possible. “Shield
formation.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Feirge asks in that sweetly mocking way of hers.</p>
<p>We’re down three, but the strength of the squad is in the whole, not
the individual. We will hold this pass, even in this godsforsaken
rain.</p>
<p>“Positive. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>There is no goddess more wrathful than Dunne. Entering Her temple
will slice the soul from any attendant who has shunned Her grace.</p>
