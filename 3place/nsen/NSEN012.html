<h4 id="chapter-ten">Chapter Ten</h4>
<p>Forty minutes later, the sun disappears as Tairn and I drop between
the snow-tipped ridgelines, descending thousands of feet into the warmer
valley that houses the Stonewater River. The sun always sets so early
this time of year. Power hums in my veins, ebbing and flowing with every
heartbeat. I’d almost forgotten how wild magic feels beyond the wards,
how accessible. Tairn’s power seems endless, deeper than the oceans I’ve
never crossed, wider than the vast sky above us.</p>
<p>“Maise saw us depart,” Tairn warns, tucking his wings. My stomach
rises as he plummets, following the terrain at a nauseating speed.
“She’s relaying an order to return immediately.”</p>
<p>“Can you ignore her?” We’re easily five minutes ahead of the other
dragons and ten ahead of the gryphons, who travel with Andarna despite
my pleas for her to stay behind.</p>
<p>“I do not answer to Maise.” He levels out over the river, a notable
tailwind helping to maintain his speed. His wings beat so close to the
rapids that I half expect to feel the splash of water as we curve around
the bend. In a few months, this river will be the most treacherous on
the Continent with spring runoff, adding to the region’s already
unpredictable weather compliments of the abrupt change in altitude.</p>
<p>Smoke rises in thick plumes ahead of us, joining the storm clouds
while simultaneously smothering the village beneath. My heart jolts with
a rush of adrenaline and dread. “Ahead.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I, too, have eyes. We’re five minutes out.” He tips right to
fit through a bottleneck in the water-carved canyon, and my weight
shifts, the belt of my saddle keeping me in place.</p>
<p>Once we’re through, I rip off my gloves, shove them into my right
front pocket, then scan both sides of the raging river for signs of
life. “I need you to slow down. I can’t tell if those are people or
trees.”</p>
<p>“You ask for speed and then complain when I provide it.” But he slows
as the landscape shifts into the high plains.</p>
<p>“This is the only logical path they’d take to—” I spot a line of
civilians hiking toward us on the southern bank of the river.
“There!”</p>
<p>“I have relayed to Feirge. The gryphons and Andarna will stop there
first as planned,” Tairn tells me, then picks up speed again. “One
minute. Prepare yourself. The pressure is dropping. We fly toward a
storm.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, my ears pop as I shove my wrist through the leather
strap that will keep the conduit secure. Quickly, I unbutton my flight
hood, letting the warmer wind rip it from my face for the sake of
visibility as we fly toward the smoke-and-flame-engulfed village.
Civilians flee from a gate in the western wall, and the acrid scent of
smoke fills my lungs, growing more pungent with each beat of Tairn’s
wings.</p>
<p>A shape breaks through the pillar of smoke—</p>
<p>“Wyvern!” I grasp the conduit in my left hand, then throw open the
door to Tairn’s power, increasing the flow from a trickle to a rush. It
envelops me, fire streaking through my veins, embers burning in my bones
as the conduit glows, siphoning off the excess.</p>
<p>“Do not channel more than you wield!” Tairn warns as the wyvern flies
straight for us, its gray, leathery wings riddled with holes.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” If I miss the first time, those fetid teeth will be in
reach of Tairn. I force myself upright against the wind, my core
tightening to keep me steady as I lift my right hand, then take aim and
release the power with a snap.</p>
<p>Lightning flashes, illuminating the clouds above for less than a
heartbeat before tearing through the sky and striking the wyvern in the
chest. The beast screams as it falls, and Tairn passes so closely
overhead that I catch the scent of charred flesh.</p>
<p>There’s no time for relief as two more burst through the smoke.</p>
<p>We’re outnumbered, and while Tairn is bigger, they are faster.</p>
<p>“High ground,” Tairn warns before banking right and climbing, putting
the village behind us.</p>
<p>I turn as far as the belt on my saddle will allow and raise my hand,
welcoming the burn as energy gathers within me, but— “They’re on
us!”</p>
<p>Too close to strike without endangering Tairn.</p>
<p>The larger wyvern’s enormous jaw opens, revealing bloodstained teeth,
and its tongue curls as it lunges with a burst of speed. “Tairn!”</p>
<p>Tairn dips his wings at an angle, catching the wind, and I hurtle
forward in the seat at the sudden decrease in speed as he swings his
massive tail. Bone cracks, blood spurts, and the wyvern spins off to the
right, missing the lower half of its jaw.</p>
<p>I can’t pivot fully, but I take aim at what I can see of the one
still pursuing us, then unleash with a crack…and miss.</p>
<p>“Fuck.” I reach—</p>
<p>“If you remove that belt, I will unseat you over the river and let
your meager gods sort you out,” Tairn warns, then banks left, giving me
the perfect view.</p>
<p>I release another strike, guiding it with the motion of my hand, and
it hits true, severing the wyvern’s head from its neck. “Got it!”</p>
<p>Fuck yes.</p>
<p>But unless those three wyvern are on a scouting patrol—unlikely,
given the flaming village—there has to be a creator nearby. I face
forward and lean into the turn, casting my focus downward. The
demarcation line is clear this high above the village. Half is devoid of
color, drained of all its magic, and in the center of the village stands
a single figure in flowing dark robes, her light hair—silver?—whipping
in the wind.</p>
<p>It’s her. The dark wielder from Jack’s cell. My grip tightens on the
conduit.</p>
<p>She looks toward us, lifts her hand, and wiggles her fingers as if
waving. A sick feeling squeezes my stomach. “I think…she was expecting
us.”</p>
<p>This is a trap.</p>
<p>And we flew right into it. My heart drops at the realization, but it
doesn’t change the fact that Maren’s family is in danger.</p>
<p>“Above!” Tairn bellows, and I look up as two wyvern emerge from the
swirling storm system.</p>
<p>I lift my hand, but there’s no time. They’re already here.</p>
<p>Tairn punches his tail forward, underneath us, swinging his body in a
way I’ve never experienced, and I fall backward, my stomach lodging in
my throat as the ground takes the place of the sky and the strap pulls
tight across my thighs, holding me upside down long enough for my heart
to pound in my ears twice.</p>
<p>Snap. Bone fractures, and Tairn rolls right, dragging the
broken-necked corpse of a wyvern with us, then releasing it once we
level. I force my stomach back where it belongs and prepare to strike
the other as it lunges for us.</p>
<p>It snaps its jaws, teeth clashing mere feet from Tairn’s shoulder as
it misses, cutting at least two years off my life. I extend my arm—</p>
<p>“Do not!” Tairn orders, and a second later, brown scales consume my
field of vision as Aotrom clasps the wyvern’s head between his teeth and
bites as we pass.</p>
<p>The wind roars like a beast, blocking out any other sound, and Tairn
banks hard, whipping himself back around. My face contorts into a
grimace at the force my body absorbs with the maneuver, and I fight to
remain conscious as we turn toward the battle.</p>
<p>Aotrom’s tail curves up, the poisonous barb jabbing into the belly of
the wyvern— I blink. A scorpiontail?</p>
<p>It’s not Aotrom.</p>
<p>“Chradh,” Tairn explains as the wyvern falls from the dragon’s
grip.</p>
<p>“What the fuck is Garrick—”</p>
<p>“Tornado!” Tairn warns a second before a wall of wind hits hard
enough to knock the breath from my lungs and drags us into its swirling
vortex.</p>
<p>We’re flung like a rag doll, and the roar of the storm vibrates every
bone in my body. Tairn snaps his wings shut, and I hold fast to the
pommels and duck my head as debris flies by, terror locking my muscles
as we’re thrown round and round and round as though we weigh
nothing.</p>
<p>Oh Malek, I am not ready to meet you.</p>
<p>“Violet!” Andarna shouts.</p>
<p>“No!” Tairn bellows as we’re spun to a near vertical position.</p>
<p>“Stay back!” I shriek, and fear burns through my bones like acid as
we’re ripped outward by centrifugal motion. She can’t get caught in
this. It has every chance of killing us and will damn sure take her
life.</p>
<p>We’re flung out of the storm like a projectile, hurtling backward
through the air toward what I think is a mountainside. Tairn opens his
wings in a burst, slowing our speed from meteoric to lethal in a move so
sudden, my head whips backward and my ears ring. His roar shakes my ribs
as he snaps his wings shut and contorts his body in an attempt to
twist.</p>
<p>His side hits first, the collision stunning me breathless and
knocking boulders loose around us with a cracking sound. Something slams
into my knee and Tairn’s wings snap over me a moment before I hear a
second thud of impact.</p>
<p>The bond goes dark.</p>
<p>NO.</p>
<p>“Tairn!” I scream, terror locking every muscle, stealing every
thought but one: he can’t be gone.</p>
<p>We fall down the ridge in a graceless, limp skid. Deprived of sight,
I can only hear the grate of rock against scale, feel the jarring hits
as we crash through obstacles and continue downward.</p>
<p>“Tairn!” I try again, mentally grasping for him, but
there’s…nothing.</p>
<p>“Violet,” Andarna cries. “I can’t feel him!”</p>
<p>“Stay back!” I repeat as we fall down and down and down. Is there a
cliff beneath us?</p>
<p>I should have heeded Tairn’s warning about the storm. Is he all
right? Has he…</p>
<p>“Don’t think like that!” she wails.</p>
<p>My heart thunders a staccato beat as we plummet, and I throw my hands
from the pommels and spread them over his scales. I can’t feel him
breathing, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t. He has to be all right. I’d
feel it if he wasn’t, right? Panic fights to close my throat. This isn’t
how he ends, how we end.</p>
<p>Liam only had minutes after Deigh ceased breathing, but he knew.</p>
<p>“Choose to live,” I beg Andarna in a rush. “You’re the only one of
your kind, you have to live. No matter what happens to us.”</p>
<p>Oh gods, Xaden.</p>
<p>“Stay with me,” she pleads, her voice breaking. “You both have to
stay.”</p>
<p>We free-fall for the length of a heartbeat, my stomach rising, and I
prepare for my final breath.</p>
<p>Earth claims us once more in a rough embrace, and this time, we grind
to a stop.</p>
<p>Tairn’s wings fall open, and I’m left dangling at a ninety-degree
angle to the ground, gasping dust-filled air. He’s fallen onto his
side.</p>
<p>I can’t see his head from this angle, so I drop any semblance of a
shield and fully reach for him. There’s a glimmer of thread where our
bond should be, but it’s enough to flood my system with hope as
something crashes behind me. A glimmer means he isn’t dead. My own
heartbeat means he can’t be—</p>
<p>His chest shudders and his breaths begin a deep, steady pattern.</p>
<p>Thank you, gods.</p>
<p>“He’s breathing,” I tell Andarna.</p>
<p>“Sorrengail!” Footsteps race toward me.</p>
<p>“Here!” I reply, my abs straining to keep position while I fight with
the belt of my saddle.</p>
<p>Garrick’s chest heaves as he appears ten feet beneath me, his hood
blown back and blood dripping from the right corner of his hairline.
“You’re alive.” He braces his hands on both knees and leans over, and I
can’t tell if he’s catching his breath or going to be ill. “Thank you,
Dunne. Tairn?” He looks up, giving me a quick appraisal and
blanching.</p>
<p>“Knocked out… What’s wrong?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Your knee is a fucking mess.”</p>
<p>I glance down at my leg, and a scream works its way up my throat as
the agony hits, like it waited until I could see exactly how fucked I am
to make itself known. My flight leathers are torn at my right knee, and
my mouth waters, bile rising quickly as I realize my kneecap isn’t where
it’s supposed to be. Searing pain hurtles up my leg and spine, stealing
logical thought as it consumes me, coming in waves that match my
heartbeat.</p>
<p>“Is it broken?” Garrick asks.</p>
<p>Seconds tick by as I concentrate solely on pushing the pain back into
a box I can manage, then force my toes to move one by one. “I think.
Just. Dislocated. Can’t fix it.” Nausea rolls through me with every
breath. “At this angle.”</p>
<p>He nods. “Drop, and I’ll catch you. We’ll get you sorted on the
ground.”</p>
<p>“Chradh?” I ask, getting a firm grip on the belt. My weight is
holding the damned buckle closed.</p>
<p>“He’s slowly coming to.” Garrick looks back over his shoulder.
“Stubborn ass turned and took the impact on his stomach. Saved my life,
but an outcropping halfway down knocked him out temporarily.”</p>
<p>That must be what happened to Tairn. That second impact I heard was
his head.</p>
<p>Shit. The silver-haired venin is still out here, and both dragons are
as good as defenseless without us, at least until the others arrive.
“Drop me, and I’ll kick you in the face.” I grit my teeth through the
pain. I’m not dying today, and neither is Tairn.</p>
<p>“Let’s be honest. You’re not kicking anyone with that knee.” He lifts
his arms up, and I’m filled with the most illogical longing for Xaden to
be standing in his place. “Come on, Violet. Trust me.”</p>
<p>I heave up, pushing against the pommels to shift my weight, then
wrench the strap through the buckle and fall like a stone. The scream
I’d held back rips free as he catches me, the world erupting in shades
of red pain at the collision.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to put it back in?” he asks, holding me as carefully
as he can.</p>
<p>I nod, and he quickly sets me on my feet and crouches in front of me,
holding on to my waist to keep me upright. The scabbards of the swords
he wears strapped to his back drag through palm-size hail stones to
scrape the rocky ground.</p>
<p>“Extend it slowly,” he orders, keeping his hazel eyes on my knee. I
turn my head, biting into the collar of my jacket to keep from screaming
again as I straighten my leg. “This won’t be pleasant. I’m so sorry,” he
says as he slides my kneecap back into place.</p>
<p>“Don’t be,” I manage to gasp, the pain immediately sliding to a level
where I can at least think somewhat properly. “Wrap is in my pack.” The
rhythmic sound of Tairn’s breathing calms my heartbeat, but I can’t see
anything beyond his dark scales to my left and hunks of granite to our
right with us all but wedged up against the mountainside.</p>
<p>He retrieves the fabric, then holds me steady as I do my best to
stabilize the joint. Pain flares as I test my weight on the limb, but
it’s miniscule compared to what could happen to Tairn if we don’t start
moving, so I tie off the fabric and call it good. It’ll do until I can
get to a healer or Brennan—but we need to get out of here alive
first.</p>
<p>“You’re good at that,” he says. Dipping down, he slings an arm around
my upper back, and I throw mine over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Lots of practice.” We make our way beside Tairn’s back, careful not
to step on his wings, and finally clear his tail as the tornado winds
its way eastward. “Your head is bleeding right above your scar from
Resson.”</p>
<p>“Good. Hate to damage the other side of my perfect face,” he jokes.
“Don’t worry about me. It’s nothing a couple of stitches won’t fix.”</p>
<p>“The others approach,” Andarna says. “They do not know Chradh is with
you, and I have not told them.”</p>
<p>The Brown Scorpiontail blocked out his riot?</p>
<p>“Tell them to go for Maren’s family first. You stay right where
you’re at until we know what’s going on.”</p>
<p>There’s a definite grumble in her response as I stagger forward with
Garrick’s help, taking a central position between Tairn and Chradh, who
looks like he might be missing a few scales along his jaw.</p>
<p>“The others are on their way,” I tell Garrick. “And I’m pretty sure
that venin knew we were coming.”</p>
<p>“That’s…great.” He grimaces. “I’ve flown through some shit, but never
been through a tornado before,” Garrick says, scanning the horizon.
We’re at least a mile south of the village.</p>
<p>“Me, either.” The smoke rises in a steady column again above the
town. I reach for Tairn’s power, but as expected, the scorching Archives
I’ve come to depend on sputter with darkness. “Want to tell me what
you’re doing here?”</p>
<p>“They made it.” Garrick tenses and pointedly looks toward the western
end of the village as Feirge and Aotrom cross the moonlight. Kira, Daja,
and Trager’s gryphon, Sila, follow soon after, all of them bearing their
riders and fliers respectively. “Maren’s family, right? That’s what
Major Safah relayed.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m here. You’re supposed to be with Xaden.” There’s no
point confirming what he already knows. “Eight hours away.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, the second he heard you were charging off into danger,
he became…unreasonable.” A muscle in Garrick’s jaw ticks, and I pull my
arm from his shoulder so he can stand straight, shifting my weight to
relieve the pressure from my right knee as much as possible. “I’ve never
seen him like that.” Garrick shoots a worried look my way. “Ever. I
don’t even want to think about what he would have done if he’d been out
here beyond the wards, because I thought he was going to rip the stones
from the wall. He’s always prided himself on control—he has to when he
wields that much power—and I’m telling you, he lost it when he heard you
were crossing the border, Violet. He’s…not himself.”</p>
<p>My chest tightens. He’d been annoyed, even angry when I flew for
Cordyn with my siblings a few months ago, but hadn’t come close to
losing it. “Because Aetos sent us to—” The words die on my tongue as I
process what he said. “He knew I was crossing the border? Maise.” I end
on a whisper, staring up at the side of Garrick’s face. “How did you get
here?”</p>
<p>“It’s not important.” He draws a sword with his left hand.</p>
<p>“Maise saw us leave maybe forty minutes ago, and you’re already here.
You’re a wind-wielder, and there’s no fucking way you pushed a
hundreds-of-miles-an-hour tailwind at Chradh, so how did you get here?”
My voice rises with my temper, and lightning strikes twenty feet in
front of us, charring the ground as thunder booms simultaneously.</p>
<p>I startle, then wince as my knee cries at the sudden movement.</p>
<p>“Damn, Sorrengail, you didn’t have to—” he starts.</p>
<p>“I didn’t.” I shake my head.</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>Our heads whip right, and the silver-haired venin walks toward us,
her purple robes billowing in the breeze. She doesn’t bother to look at
Tairn as she passes mere yards in front of his hind claws, just keeps
those eerie red eyes pinned on us. On me.</p>
<p>Wait. She did…what? Lightning?</p>
<p>Blood drains from my face and I throw up my shields, drawing on
Andarna’s power.</p>
<p>Holy Dunne, she wielded lightning. But venin aren’t supposed to have
signets…let alone mine.</p>
<p>Dread pins my heart to the ground, but my hands are fast as I
unsheathe and fling two daggers at her chest.</p>
<p>She waves her hand left and right, and the knives fall mid-flight.
“Is that any way to thank me?”</p>
<p>Fuck. I should have brought the mini crossbow Maren gave me.</p>
<p>“Thank you for what, exactly?” Garrick raises his sword and moves to
my side as I reach for Tairn’s power again, finding a dim hum.</p>
<p>“Now wouldn’t be a bad time to manifest a second signet,” I tell
Andarna as the dark wielder approaches. My heart thunders like a drum.
All the venin has to do is palm the earth and the four of us will be
desiccated in seconds.</p>
<p>“As if I control how you use my power?” Andarna counters.</p>
<p>Second signet. My gaze darts toward Garrick, but a glance is all I
can afford with the dark wielder sauntering toward us.</p>
<p>“Not killing you, of course.” The dark wielder cocks her head to the
side and runs her gaze over me in blatant appraisal, then pauses about
ten feet away. The scarlet veins beside her eyes remind me of a
masquerade mask topped by the faded tattoo on her forehead, and the red
glow around her irises is ten shades brighter than Jack’s. A Sage,
probably…maybe even a Maven, and were it not for the physical signs of
her lost soul, she’d be stunningly beautiful, with high cheekbones and a
full mouth, but her skin’s eerily pale. “Though I must say I’m
disappointed you were so easily lured from your wards.” She tsks at me.
“Shame the girl’s family raised weapons at me, or they might have
lived.” She shoots a warning glance at Garrick, but he doesn’t lower his
sword.</p>
<p>The girl’s family… My hands curl into fists.</p>
<p>“You killed Maren’s family?” Rock and ice crunch under my boots as I
take two steps toward her. “To lure me?” Anger curdles my stomach.</p>
<p>“Only the parents.” She rolls her eyes. “I left the boys as a sign of
goodwill, though you can’t say the same about my wyvern, can you?”</p>
<p>“Goodwill?” I shout. Maren’s going to be devastated.</p>
<p>“Violet,” Garrick warns, but he keeps with me step for step.</p>
<p>“Careful with your tone, lightning wielder.” The dark wielder flicks
her wrist, and Garrick rises in the air in a nauseating reenactment of
every one of my nightmares. His sword drops to the ground, and he
scrambles for his throat. “You, I’m curious about. I’ll even admit to
wanting, considering all that power, not to mention being an effective
leash. But him?” She shakes her head, and Garrick begins to kick.</p>
<p>Leash. That’s exactly what Jack called me. She knows about Xaden.</p>
<p>“Let him go!” I draw another dagger and shove every hint of fear
aside. Nothing’s happening to Garrick on my watch. “This might not kill
you, but it will hurt like hell.”</p>
<p>“Let’s not compare weapons.” She reaches for a knife sheathed in the
belt of her gauzy purple robe and reveals just enough of its green tip
to seize my breath for a heartbeat. “Our paths are too intertwined to
begin with such hostility. I know: you answer a single question and I’ll
return the walker to the ground. That seems a civil start to our
relationship, don’t you think, Violet?”</p>
<p>“Ask it.” I feel Andarna hovering along our bond, alert and hopefully
nowhere near us. “Warn the others.”</p>
<p>“They’re coming.” Frustration sharpens her words.</p>
<p>“You prize his friend’s life over information. Interesting.” She
shoves the knife back into its sheath. “I’m Theophanie, by the way.
Seems only right that you know my name, seeing as I know everything
about you, Violet Sorrengail.”</p>
<p>Fucking awesome. “Because of Jack?” It’s the only logical
explanation.</p>
<p>She shrugs in a dismissive gesture that reminds me of the Duchess of
Morraine. “Bonding one dragon is…enviable. All that power just given to
you.” Her mouth tightens. “But two is unheard of. Aren’t you the
luckiest girl on the Continent? Or maybe that’s me, being close by when
your morningstartail was spotted.”</p>
<p>“Is that really your question?” My fingernails cut into my palms as
Garrick’s kicks become more desperate.</p>
<p>“Just an observation.” Her gaze flicks toward Garrick. “For good
faith.” She turns her hand and Garrick crashes to the ground beside me,
wheezing as he draws breath. “Now tell me, which chose you first? The
one who gifted you the power of the sky? Or the irid?”</p>
<p>In the hope and excitement this new development of the bonds between
dragons, gryphons, and their humans brings, I wonder</p>
<p>who has stopped to contemplate the nature of magic’s balance.</p>
<p>Do we not risk the equal rise of the very powers we seek to
wield?</p>
