<h4 id="chapter-eleven">Chapter Eleven</h4>
<p>“Irid?” I blink and fight like hell to keep my face blank.</p>
<p>“Yes, your irid.” Theophanie surveys the sky, then the landscape
behind us as Garrick staggers to his feet, sword in hand. “Some do not
believe, but I knew as soon as the cream-robed scholars whispered about
the seventh breed in your war college. Pity I had to leave so abruptly.
One hasn’t been seen in centuries, and I was so hoping to set…eyes on
her.” She finishes the statement like the threat it is, bringing her
crimson gaze to mine.</p>
<p>Andarna. Terror races up my spine and lightens my head.</p>
<p>“Irid,” Andarna whispers. “Yes. I remember now. That is what my kind
are called. I am an irid scorpiontail.”</p>
<p>“Fly for the wards!” I scream mentally. “She’s not here for me. She
wants you.”</p>
<p>“I will not abandon you,” she roars.</p>
<p>“Everyone on the Continent needs you alive. Now fly.” My fingers
brush the conduit hanging from my wrist, but it’s of no use to me
without Tairn’s power. I need to stall, give Andarna enough time to
escape. “She’s out of your reach.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.” Theophanie studies my face. “Disappointing, but it wouldn’t be
fun if I caught my prey on the first attempt. You truly don’t know what
she is, do you?” The dark wielder’s mouth curves into a delighted smile
that instantly sickens my stomach. “What a prize you’ve won. Sometimes I
forget just how short mortal memory can be.”</p>
<p>Mortal. As opposed to what? Immortal? How fucking old is she?</p>
<p>She moves sideways, toward the village, and Garrick and I both mimic
her movement, putting ourselves between her and Tairn. “When the shadow
wielder comes to us—”</p>
<p>“He won’t,” I snap. Power hums, filling me at a trickle as the sound
of wingbeats fills the air.</p>
<p>Tairn’s waking up, but whatever’s coming at us is coming fast.</p>
<p>“He will,” she says in that same infuriatingly certain tone Xaden
uses. Lightning cracks like punctuation, branching through the cloud
overhead.</p>
<p>She didn’t even have to lift her hands. Holy shit, I’m outmatched in
every possible way.</p>
<p>“And when you come with him, you will remember that I let you live
today and choose me, not Berwyn, as your teacher.” She retreats step by
slow step, extending her arms out at her sides.</p>
<p>Maybe venin lose their minds with their souls, but humoring her gives
Andarna more time to flee. “And why would I do that?”</p>
<p>Power comes flooding back, scalding my bones, and I let it gather and
coil.</p>
<p>“Besides the fact that he’s subpar and you’d be chained to him,
powerless to resist his orders?” She sneers in disgust, then schools her
features. “I’ll let you keep both your dragons while giving you what you
want most in the world.” Her gaze drops to the conduit as wind pulses.
The others must be here. “Control and knowledge.”</p>
<p>Tairn swivels and his head snaps toward Theophanie, but his teeth
close just short of her feet as she’s plucked off the ground by the claw
of a wyvern. Its gray wings beat fast and hard, blasting us with wind
and carrying its creator from the battlefield.</p>
<p>“Holy shit, we’re actually alive,” Garrick says, lowering his sword.
“She left us alive.”</p>
<p>“Are you all right?” I ask Tairn, my voice cracking.</p>
<p>“I am not deceased.” He gains his feet, his talons digging into the
rocky soil.</p>
<p>Relief pricks at my eyes, and my vision wobbles.</p>
<p>“Do not dehydrate on my account,” he lectures. “It takes more than
weather to fell me.” His golden gaze drops to my knee. “Wish I could say
the same for you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re just fine,” I mutter, then turn toward Garrick, who’s
already picking up one of my lost daggers. “You don’t have to do
that.”</p>
<p>“You’re not exactly in a position to walk,” he reminds me, scooping
up the second.</p>
<p>“Did you?” I ask quickly as the wingbeats grow louder. “She called
you a walker.”</p>
<p>He’d traveled a thousand miles in minutes, and there’s only one way
I’ve read about to accomplish that, but no one has done it in
centuries.</p>
<p>Garrick wipes the back of his hand across his temple, and it comes
away bloody. “Yeah, and she called you a leash.” No wonder he’s best
friends with Xaden. They’re both excellent at dodging questions.</p>
<p>“You have a second signet, don’t you?” And like Xaden, he hid the
strongest one.</p>
<p>“So do you.” He hands back my daggers and sways. “Or at least you
will.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” I hold his gaze while sheathing the blades and wade
through the significance of what he’s concealing. “You know the last
time someone wielded distance—”</p>
<p>“Never said I did,” he interrupts, looking toward Chradh with a flash
of a smile as the Brown Scorpiontail lumbers to his feet. “Scared me
there for a second.” He scoffs. “Yes, I know how much energy it takes.
Trust me, you’re missing far more skin than I am.”</p>
<p>“You should go.” I motion toward Chradh and my knee throbs as the
adrenaline starts to wear off. “Now, before they get close enough to see
you. I know he’s blocked out the riot, so your secret is still safe if
you leave in the next few seconds.”</p>
<p>Garrick’s gaze swings to mine, clearly torn. “Getting you into the
saddle—”</p>
<p>“Thank you for risking exposure by coming to help me, but go.” I lift
my brows. “My squad will help me.”</p>
<p>Garrick tilts his head like he’s listening, then nods. “You’ll come
straight back to Basgiath?”</p>
<p>I nod. “Run.”</p>
<p>He stays a second longer, then takes off sprinting toward Chradh. He
launches in the shadows, flying out of sight as my squad nears.</p>
<p>“Did you know?” I ask Tairn.</p>
<p>“We do not gossip about our riders.”</p>
<p>Good point. If they did, Xaden would be dead by now.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“This is ridiculous,” I tell Tairn as he descends not into the flight
field but straight into the courtyard of the quadrant twenty hours
later.</p>
<p>“So is thinking you can hobble back from the flight field.” Screams
sound from the dozen or so cadets who run for the safety of the
dormitory wing as Tairn lands in the mud. At least it’s stopped
snowing.</p>
<p>“Violet!” Brennan charges past the fleeing cadets, his brow pinched
with worry.</p>
<p>“Did you seriously tell my brother?” I glare at Tairn, knowing full
well he can’t see me.</p>
<p>“Of course not.” Tairn snorts, and steam covers the dormitory wing
windows.</p>
<p>“I told Marbh,” Andarna announces, landing on Tairn’s right, her
scales as black as his.</p>
<p>“I’m fine!” I call down to Brennan, ripping the belt free and cursing
when the stitches catch again. Biting my lip keeps me from crying out as
I force myself out of the saddle. “So much for not gossiping.”</p>
<p>She snorts, and I begin the humiliating exercise of scooting over
Tairn’s back on my ass while she looks on.</p>
<p>Tairn dips his shoulder when I reach it, and I fail to smother the
sharp gasp of pain as I lift my right leg so I can slide down. “How
about you go get me a set of crutches, and I’ll—”</p>
<p>“How about you get down here,” Xaden says, standing where I’d
expected to find Brennan. My heartbeat jolts. Gods, he looks good,
staring up at me with the kind of intensity that used to rattle my
nerves when I was a first-year. He lifts one arm, and shadows rush up
from beneath Tairn and solidify as they wrap around my waist. “Now would
be preferable.” He crooks his fingers at me. “I would do the same for
any wounded rider.”</p>
<p>“I somehow doubt that.” I slide down Tairn’s leg, and the shadows
turn me sideways at the last second and lift me into Xaden’s waiting
arms. “My, my.” I brush a lock of dark hair off his forehead, then hook
my arms around his neck and settle against his chest, ignoring the
throbbing protest of my knee as it bends. “What else can you do with
those shadows, Lieutenant Riorson?”</p>
<p>He locks his jaw and keeps his eyes straight ahead as he carries me
away from Tairn and past Brennan, who holds the door to the dormitory
wing open.</p>
<p>“Commons is closest,” Brennan says, quickly catching up to Xaden.</p>
<p>Every line of Xaden’s body is rigid as he follows Brennan through the
rotunda and up into commons. Tension radiates off him in waves of
shadows that swirl like footprints as I look back over his shoulder, and
when I reach out mentally, he has me blocked.</p>
<p>“You’re angry,” I whisper as Brennan charges ahead, ordering cadets
out of a meeting room to the right of the announcements board.</p>
<p>“Anger does not fully describe my current feelings,” Xaden replies,
striding through the door into the windowless chamber. Shadows shove all
six chairs on this side of the long, coarse table out of the way, and he
sets me on the surface with extreme care, then retreats, putting his
back to the wall.</p>
<p>“I did exactly what you would have in the same situation,” I argue,
bracing my weight with my palms as Brennan moves to my knee, leaving the
door open. “If you would—”</p>
<p>Xaden lifts a single finger. “Not. Yet.”</p>
<p>My eyes narrow on him as Brennan slices through my wrap with a
dagger. “And I thought you were headed home?” I ask my brother.</p>
<p>“Just helping put the finer points on the alliance.” He grimaces at
the black-and-blue expanse of my knee. “Lucky for you, I’m still here.
Twenty hours in the saddle didn’t exactly help the swelling, Vi.”</p>
<p>“Neither would have trying to dismount at Samara.” I wince as Brennan
prods the joint.</p>
<p>“I brought some arinmint with me. I’ll have it steeped in milk to
help speed the deep healing.” He nods to himself. “It helped after you
were poisoned.”</p>
<p>“You brought arinmint out of Aretia?” Xaden glowers at my
brother.</p>
<p>“Breaking the law in front of the duke,” I try to tease my brother,
but the pain makes my words pitchy and it falls flat. Fuck, that hurts.
My leg throbs twice as hard without the wrap.</p>
<p>“I’m well versed in how to use it. You know they don’t take too
kindly to walking out of negotiations when you speak for your province,
right?” Brennan spreads his hands over the joint and looks over his
shoulder at Xaden. “You’re not just a rider anymore and should probably
get back—” He blinks as Xaden delivers a withering glare. “Never mind. I
would not want to be you,” he says under his breath at me, then closes
his eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s not her fault!” Garrick shouts as he races through the doorway,
all but skidding to a stop at the foot of the table.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Xaden asks.</p>
<p>“Crossing into Poromiel was definitely a choice.” Garrick shucks off
his flight jacket and drops it on the nearest chair. “But the tornado? A
regional hazard. The dark wielder—”</p>
<p>“You’ve already pled her case. Twice.” Xaden’s tone is almost bored
as he folds his arms.</p>
<p>“I don’t need to be protected from him.” I shake my head at Garrick
as heat envelops my knee, then glance Xaden’s way. “I own my
decisions.”</p>
<p>“Well-the-fuck-aware.” Xaden closes his eyes and leans his head back
against the wall.</p>
<p>“She’s here!” Rhiannon calls out from the doorway.</p>
<p>Second-years flood into the room, including Maren and her two little
brothers, who seem glued to her side.</p>
<p>“You two sit,” Maren says gently to the boys, and Trager pulls out
two chairs across the table for them. The twin boys are seven, with her
ochre complexion, dark hair, and honey-brown, grief-stricken eyes, which
must be why the two feel so familiar to me. They were also silent every
time we stopped on the flight here. She crouches in front of them.
“We’ll get it all sorted out. I promise.”</p>
<p>“Sit down,” Trager says to Cat, pulling out another seat.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” She wobbles and rubs the back of her neck.</p>
<p>“You’re swaying where you stand.” He gestures to the chair.
“Sit.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” she grumbles, all but falling into the chair. “Maren, you
too.”</p>
<p>Every single one of us is exhausted.</p>
<p>“You disobeyed a direct order?” General Aetos storms into the room,
then startles at the sight of Brennan and Xaden.</p>
<p>The heat intensifies at my knee, and the pain lessens slowly as
Brennan mends the stressed ligament and swollen tissue.</p>
<p>“We were ordered to make ourselves useful, and did so”—Rhiannon steps
between Aetos and the rest of the squad—“sir.” The title doesn’t come
out like a compliment. “Our early return was signed off on by Lieutenant
Colonel Degrensi, given that they did not have a mender at the outpost
and are already overwhelmed with wounded. Surely you’re satisfied now
that Cadet Sorrengail is wounded. We completed your punishment.”</p>
<p>“And we’ll do it again.” Ridoc kicks back in his seat, throwing his
feet up on the table. “And again, and again.”</p>
<p>Aetos’s face flushes. “I’m sorry, cadet?”</p>
<p>“He said we’ll do it again.” I lift my chin and note the shadows
creeping across the stone floor toward Aetos. “We make decisions as a
squad. We’ll take whatever punishment you want to give us as a squad.
What we won’t do is stand by while civilians die, regardless of what
citizenship they hold. And before you ask, every single dragon and
gryphon agreed.”</p>
<p>Hatred flares in Aetos’s eyes, but he quickly glances at Brennan.
“You have no right to be here, Aisereigh. This is a quadrant
matter.”</p>
<p>“It’s Sorrengail,” Brennan says without opening his eyes. “And even
if Article Two, Section Four of the Basgiath Code of Conduct didn’t
allow for menders to be granted access to all areas of campus—which it
does—well, I don’t answer to you.”</p>
<p>My throat clogs when I spot the newly sewn name tag on his
uniform.</p>
<p>“And who answers for them?” Aetos points to the boys. “King Tauri has
refused to open our borders.”</p>
<p>Even now? I struggle to keep my jaw from dropping. How is that not
part of the negotiations?</p>
<p>A corner of Aetos’s mouth rises, as if he knows he’s won. “They’ll
have to be returned home. Immediately.”</p>
<p>My gaze swings to Xaden, and I find him already watching me. I lift
my brows and he sighs, then turns his head toward Aetos.</p>
<p>“As we’re concluding this round of negotiations this afternoon,
Lieutenant Colonel Sorrengail will happily take the boys home—” Xaden
starts, and Maren gasps. “To Tyrrendor, seeing as they are now Tyrrish
citizens.”</p>
<p>“Since when?” Aetos stiffens, and the heat in my knee dissipates as
Brennan lifts his hands.</p>
<p>“Since I said so,” Xaden answers with icy authority.</p>
<p>“Ah. I see.” If Aetos gets any redder, I’m afraid he might pop. “And
with the negotiations wrapping up this afternoon, I expect you and
Lieutenant Tavis to be joining the Eastern Wing as ordered, so there
won’t be any need to remind you that commissioned officers aren’t
readily welcomed within the quadrant, nor encouraged to fraternize with
cadets. The leniency you enjoyed this fall will not be extended under my
watch.”</p>
<p>No. My heart sinks. Xaden won’t be allowed to come and go as he
pleases like he did in Aretia, which means we’ll be separated. And on
the border, there’s every chance he’ll have to pass beyond the wards,
where his access to magic won’t be limited.</p>
<p>“I doubt Sgaeyl would agree,” Xaden warns in a tone that reminds me
just how little guilt he feels when it comes to killing enemies who get
in his way.</p>
<p>“Your dragon is always welcome in the Vale. You’re simply not welcome
in the quadrant.” Aetos’s focus snaps to Garrick. “You and Lieutenant
Riorson will depart by tomorrow afternoon for the Eastern Wing as
ordered.”</p>
<p>“As General Melgren ordered,” Garrick responds with a slight nod.
“Seeing as we’re under his chain of command. Or at least I am.” He
glances back at Xaden. “Not sure about His Grace over here, since it’s
been a few centuries since any sitting member of the Senarium has worn
black, but I’m pretty sure he commands Tyrrish forces now.”</p>
<p>Xaden doesn’t deign to reply.</p>
<p>“I don’t care who orders whom as long as you get out of my war
college.” Aetos straightens his lapel. “For the rest of you, classes
resume tomorrow.” His gaze finds mine and lights with nauseating
cruelty. “I’m afraid I’ll have to leave you, seeing as my belongings are
currently being delivered to the commanding general’s quarters. Have to
say, there’s a lovely view from the personal office.”</p>
<p>The comment hits as intended, and my chest threatens to crumple at
the thought of Aetos living in the space Mom and Dad used to share.</p>
<p>Brennan straightens to his full height, and Aetos backs away with a
smile, disappearing into commons.</p>
<p>“I fucking hate him,” Ridoc says, rocking forward and putting all
four legs of his chair on the floor. “How did Dain turn out halfway
normal with that prick as a father?”</p>
<p>“Language,” Maren hisses, though I doubt the boys heard her,
considering they’ve both nodded off.</p>
<p>“He had ours, too,” Brennan replies to Ridoc.</p>
<p>“Until he didn’t,” I mutter.</p>
<p>“Is she mended?” Xaden asks without bothering to look at Brennan, his
eyes locked on mine.</p>
<p>“She is,” I note with a smirk, then bend my knee damn near
painlessly.</p>
<p>“No pain?” Brennan asks, swiping the back of his hand across his
sweaty forehead as he looks at me.</p>
<p>“Nothing more than usual.” I flex the joint again. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Get out,” Xaden orders without looking away, but I’m more than aware
he isn’t talking to me.</p>
<p>Everyone stills.</p>
<p>“Let me rephrase,” Xaden says slowly. “Everyone get out now. And
close the door.”</p>
<p>“Good luck, Violet,” Ridoc calls back over his shoulder as Rhi pushes
him out the door with the others, Maren and Cat carrying the twins, and
in under a minute, I hear the distinct click of the door shutting.</p>
<p>“You can’t seriously be angry with me,” I start as Xaden surges off
the wall, coming at me with the force of a hurricane. “You’ve never once
begrudged my autonomy”—he reaches over me, takes my hips in his hands,
and yanks my ass to the edge of the table, turning me to face him—“and
I’m not going to tolerate you starting now. What are you doing?”</p>
<p>He grasps the back of my neck and slams his mouth against mine.</p>
<p>You might be angry when you realize I didn’t wake you to say goodbye.
But it’s only because I no longer fully trust my ability to walk
away.</p>

Sixteenth Duke of Tyrrendor, to Cadet Violet Sorrengail</p>
