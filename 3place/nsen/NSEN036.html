<h4 id="chapter-thirty-four">Chapter Thirty-Four</h4>
<p>Of all the ways I’d envisioned getting to know Xaden’s mother,
holding her at bay in a bedroom doorway of her own house while her son
refuses to see her definitely never came to mind.</p>
<p>“This is very kind of you.” I balance the silver tray of snacks she’s
just delivered on one hand and grip the golden doorknob with the other.
“I’ll be sure he gets these. And thank you for sending our
missives.”</p>
<p>Having seen renderings of Fen Riorson, I can definitely say that
Xaden takes after him in looks, but there are traces of Talia, too.
Xaden shares her high cheekbones, her long eyelashes, and even the shape
of her ears, but it’s the gold flecks in their eyes that make the
biological link undeniable.</p>
<p>Hopefully Andarna’s kind will know how to bring the gold back fully
in Xaden’s.</p>
<p>“It was lucky a ship bound for Deverelli was in the harbor to take
your correspondence.” Talia uses her considerable height advantage to
peer over my head into our bedroom with eyes so full of longing that
pity wraps around my rib cage, then constricts. “I was hoping he might
want to talk?”</p>
<p>He definitely does not.</p>
<p>“He’s resting.” I force a quick, sympathetic smile and pull the door
closer, narrowing her scope of vision.</p>
<p>“What about dinner? He should meet the rest of the family.”</p>
<p>What an awful idea. He’s been nearly catatonic since this morning,
and she wants to throw a party with people he’s never met? “I’ll ask,
but that might be a lot for him to—”</p>
<p>“We’ll keep it small, then.” Talia’s face falls with her gaze and she
purses her lips, forming little golden-brown lines around her mouth. “I
was so young when he was born,” she whispers, staring at the doorframe.
“Still young when the contract expired. I never thought I’d get to see
him again, and now that he’s here…” Tears fill her eyes as she slowly
looks at me. “You understand, right?”</p>
<p>What in Amari’s name am I supposed to say to that? Of course I can’t
understand how anyone would leave him, but—</p>
<p>“Tell her the truth. He loathes her,” Tairn suggests. “As does
Sgaeyl. The life-giver is lucky she wasn’t scorched this morning, though
I do believe Sgaeyl is still contemplating her options.”</p>
<p>Because that would be great for international relations, considering
who Talia is married to.</p>
<p>“That’s his mother,” Andarna argues. “What would you do, Violet?”</p>
<p>“I’m not the person to ask about motherly relationships,” I reply.
Grief slices quick and deep, giving strength to the pity that’s
stretching its viny little tethers toward my heart. “I understand
wanting to know him,” I tell Talia. “He is spectacular in every
way—”</p>
<p>“Then you’ll let—” She steps toward me.</p>
<p>“Dinner,” I say, standing my ground. “I’ll see if he’s willing to
have dinner. But if he isn’t, you’re going to have to respect that, too.
You push, and he’ll shove back twice as hard.”</p>
<p>She braces her hand on the doorframe and shifts her eyes in thought.
“What if I can promise you’ll get a meeting with the full triumvirate?
That’s what you need, right? Maybe I can give you some answers they’ll
look for to evaluate your acumen.”</p>
<p>I blink, and pity recedes an inch. “What I need is for Xaden to be
all right. If that means setting this house on fire and leaving without
accomplishing anything else on this isle, then I’ll hand him a torch.”
Damn, this tray is getting heavy.</p>
<p>Her posture softens and she steps out of my space, her hand falling
to her side. “You must love him to prioritize his feelings over your
mission,” she says quietly, like it’s a revelation.</p>
<p>“Yes.” I nod. “It’s nothing compared to the way he risked Aretia for
me.”</p>
<p>“He risked Aretia,” she whispers through a watery smile. “Then he
loves you, too. His father never would have…” She shakes her head, and
her hair rustles against the back of her gown. “Doesn’t matter. Having
dinner with him would be more than I’d ever hoped for. I’ll send someone
up in a few hours to see if he’s willing to join us.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” I wait until she heads down the long cream-colored
hallway, then shut the door and turn the lock just in case.</p>
<p>Then I take the tray in both hands and go find Xaden.</p>
<p>The room they gave us is obviously meant for guests of distinction.
It has high, vaulted ceilings; intricately carved furniture;
sophisticated artwork; and a bed that could easily sleep four people.
Everything is cream with touches of pale green and gold, all perfect in
a way that borders on too pretty to touch. Our black flight jackets look
sorely out of place draped across the chair of the delicate desk, and
our packs and boots are so dirty I insisted on leaving them in the
attached bathing chamber.</p>
<p>The carpet is soft under my bare feet as I cross the spacious room
and open one of the double glass doors onto the covered veranda. The
high balcony links with the four other bedrooms to the right on this
side of the house, so it’s no surprise to find Garrick sitting on the
edge of the balustrade with Ridoc, their backs to the ocean.</p>
<p>But it does surprise me to find the cushioned loveseat empty.</p>
<p>Ridoc lifts his brows at me and tilts his head to my left, and I take
the cue, shimmying between the guys and the decorative table in front of
the loveseat when they hop off the railing.</p>
<p>“Good luck.” Garrick pats my shoulder, and the two retreat down the
veranda.</p>
<p>I find Xaden on the shaded floor between the loveseat and the corner
piece of railing where my armor is tied, drying in the ocean breeze. He
sits in sparring pants and an undershirt with his back against the wall,
bare forearms resting on raised knees, gaze fixed into the distance.</p>
<p>“Room for one more down there?” I ask.</p>
<p>He blinks, then forces a half smile. “For you? I’ll move to the
couch.”</p>
<p>“Don’t even think about it.” I squeeze in next to the railing,
careful not to twist my torso and anger my ribs, then sit and set the
tray on the floor in front of me.</p>
<p>“These fell out of your pack.” He opens his fist, revealing the two
vials Bodhi gave me.</p>
<p>Shit. “Thanks.” I take the vials and slip them into my pants
pocket.</p>
<p>“That little one-two combo would definitely help me get my hands on
you at home if I didn’t think Sgaeyl would torch me for willingly
blocking the bond, even temporarily.”</p>
<p>I swallow. “I should have told you I had it—”</p>
<p>“You don’t owe me an explanation.” He looks me straight in the eye.
“I’m glad you have it. I don’t want to lose my connection to Sgaeyl, not
when I can still use my signet to fight venin, especially since you have
one obsessively hunting you. But feel free to shove that serum down my
throat if at any moment I’m not…myself. I’d rather be powerless than
potentially hurt you.” He glances down at the tray. “My mother?”</p>
<p>Nice subject change.</p>
<p>“She brought you food, but really only wanted to talk to you.”
Through the gaps in the railing, I look out over the strip of sand that
meets the ocean and press my lips into a tight line. While Tairn and
Andarna sun their scales on the beach, Sgaeyl prowls along the
waterline, her head low, her eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“She’s pacing for some reason,” Xaden says as Sgaeyl passes by. “Not
that I can ask her.” He huffs a self-deprecating laugh. “Not that she’d
answer.”</p>
<p>“She’s worried.” I look over at his freshly salved wound. Good, the
swelling has decreased a little already.</p>
<p>“Worrying isn’t in her nature. She likes to solve the immediate
problem and handle consequences later.” He leans over and plucks a
cinnamon-sprinkled dried fig from a crystal bowl, then studies it. “Of
course there’s fucking sugar on it. Like somehow remembering that one
little fact from when I was seven years old is going to make up for the
last thirteen years.”</p>
<p>He leans again and drops it onto the empty plate, and I remain
silent, hoping he’ll continue. He’s never really talked about his mom
before.</p>
<p>“And all this time I figured she was living in Poromiel. She never
even told me she was from Hedotis. Neither of them did.” He leans his
head back against the wall. “Makes sense now—why she never had family
visit, why she was so infatuated with all things colorful, the bedtime
stories told with arinmint tea when she would whisper about people with
purple eyes who lived without war.”</p>
<p>Waves crash against the beach below, and Sgaeyl turns, pacing back
toward us.</p>
<p>“You should see if she’ll hunt with the others,” I suggest to
Tairn.</p>
<p>“Feel free to ask. I’ll watch. Be sure you’re near the water so you
can put yourself out when she sets you on fire,” he replies.</p>
<p>“It’s a mineral called viladrite,” I tell Xaden as he flicks the
sugar off his fingers. “Dad wrote that it’s so prevalent on the isle
that it’s in everything they eat and drink. It turns paler eye colors
purple.”</p>
<p>“I love that you know that.” He drops his hand to my knee. “Did your
dad’s eyes change?”</p>
<p>“Not that I know of. They were always hazel like mine.” I smile at
the memory. “Guess he wasn’t here long enough.” I still can’t figure out
when he had time to study the isles, but maybe my grandmother knows, if
I ever get the courage to speak with her like Mira did.</p>
<p>“We’ll only be here long enough to search the isle for Andarna’s kind
and speak with the triumvirate”—the bruise on his jaw ripples when he
clenches his teeth—“and my mother is married to one of them. The irony
is poetic.”</p>
<p>I twist toward him and wince when my ribs object. “She wants to have
dinner tonight.”</p>
<p>“Fuck that.” His expression shifts into the same impenetrable mask he
used to wear around me last year.</p>
<p>“Xaden.” I cradle the side of his face and stroke my thumb over the
edge of his scar. “Don’t shut me out.”</p>
<p>His eyes flash to mine. “Never.” Sliding an arm behind me, he grabs
hold of my hips with both hands and carefully lifts me into his lap. “I
can think of far better ways to spend my evening than dinner.” He grazes
his teeth along the shell of my ear, and a shiver rolls down my spine.
“Can’t you?”</p>
<p>I gasp at the sudden rush of heat that flares low in my stomach when
he kisses the side of my neck, flicking his tongue at the spot he knows
turns me into a puddle.</p>
<p>“No magic,” he reminds me, sliding his hand down my stomach. “No
danger of losing control.”</p>
<p>A whimper escapes my lips as his fingers dip beneath my waistband,
mostly because what he suggests sounds fucking fantastic, but partially
because I want all of him. I miss the heightened rush from our signets,
his shadows flaring, my lightning cracking, the intimacy of lowering
every barrier and hearing his voice fill my mind. I need to feel him
unravel under my touch. Losing control is part of what makes us…us.</p>
<p>“No lumpy bedrolls,” he continues, slipping his hand into my pants.
“No squadmates ten feet away. No awkward dinners. Just you and me and
that bed.”</p>
<p>I groan, instantly remembering what we’re supposed to be talking
about. “As utterly delicious as that sounds…” My fingers dig into his
thigh as his mouth toys with my earlobe. “Sex is not going to fix the
real problem.”</p>
<p>He sighs, then lifts his head. “I know.”</p>
<p>I scramble out of his lap before I change my mind and drag him to our
bed. The quick motion has me hissing through the sharp sting as I stand
and grasp the railing with both hands, facing the water.</p>
<p>“Fuck.” Xaden jumps to his feet and wraps his arms around me gently.
“I’m so sorry. I forgot about your ribs. You shouldn’t be flying, let
alone have me crawling all over you.”</p>
<p>“Not flying isn’t an option.” I breathe in through my nose and out
through my mouth as the worst of it passes. “And never apologize for
touching me.”</p>
<p>He drops his chin on the top of my head. “I hate that we can’t get
you mended.”</p>
<p>“In a life without magic, the best medicine is time,” I muse, a smile
curving my mouth as I spot Cat and Trager walking down the beach, hand
in hand. “Look at that.”</p>
<p>“Good for them. He’s been pining after her for years.” His hands
bracket mine on the railing, and his body heat staves off the chill from
the ocean breeze. “How much pain are you in? I don’t want to ask you to
sit through dinner if it hurts.”</p>
<p>I’m not about to be a barrier if he wants to talk to his mother,
especially knowing what I would give to have the same opportunity with
mine. “It’s not too bad as long as I don’t twist. Or breathe too deeply.
Or lift Andarna.” The joke falls flat.</p>
<p>“So you can sit through dinner.” The conflict in his voice has me
turning in his arms.</p>
<p>“Only if you want to.” I look up at him.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to?” He swallows.</p>
<p>“I’m not making that choice for you.” I bring my hands to his chest,
trying to remember the last time he was indecisive about anything and
coming up short.</p>
<p>His eyes narrow and he steps back. “You think I should, don’t
you?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter what I think.” I shake my head. “And I’m probably
not the best person to give you advice on this—”</p>
<p>“Because she charmed you in the three minutes it took for her to push
a tray through the door?” He puts more space between us, retreating down
the veranda.</p>
<p>“Because my mother just died.”</p>
<p>He stills, and regret instantly washes over his face. “I’m sorry,
Violet.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to be. I’m just saying that I’m not the person to ask
if you should spend a night talking to yours, because I would give
anything for ten minutes with mine.” I set my hand over my chest like it
has a prayer of holding the grief inside where it belongs. “I have so
many questions, and I would kill for a single answer. Maybe you should
talk to Garrick, because any advice I give you would be poisoned by my
own grief. You have to do whatever’s best for you. Whatever you can live
with once we leave here. Whatever choice you make will be the right one
as far as I’m concerned. You have all my support.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if there’s a right choice. She’s not like your mother.”
He laces his hands behind his neck as Sgaeyl passes by again, following
her own footprints. “I absolutely understand you wanting ten minutes. I
want them for you. Right or wrong, everything your mother did was to
protect you and your siblings. She died protecting you.”</p>
<p>“I know.” I swallow the growing lump in my throat.</p>
<p>“My mother abandoned me.” His hands drop to his sides.</p>
<p>“I know,” I repeat in a whisper, my heart breaking all over again for
him. “I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>“How does she”—he points to the door—“deserve my ten minutes when she
fed me chocolate cake on my tenth birthday and vanished later that
night? I am the fulfillment of a contract for her. Nothing more. I don’t
give a shit how she looks at me, or whatever bullshit she undoubtedly
spewed at you. The only reason we’re in her house is because she’s
married to one of the triumvirate, and I have no problem using that to
get what we need.”</p>
<p>My chest cracks a little more with every word, then splits clean
open. I knew she’d left, just not how.</p>
<p>“And don’t think that has anything to do with this.” He points to his
eye. “I’m aware in the moments I lack emotion. You and Garrick don’t
need to share little oh no glances. I already feel it. It’s like sliding
over a frozen lake while a shrinking part of me screams that I’m
supposed to be swimming in those pieces I’ve bartered away, and those
feelings are right beneath the surface, but fuck is skating faster and a
hell of a lot less messy. This shit?” He swings his finger back toward
the house. “It’s messy and painful and infuriating, and if I could
choose to give this portion of myself away, so help me, Malek, I would.
I get it now. It’s not just the power that’s addicting; it’s the freedom
to not feel this.”</p>
<p>“Xaden,” I whisper, all but bleeding out by the time he finishes.</p>
<p>Steam billows over the veranda, and our heads whip in the direction
of the beach, where Sgaeyl stands the width of Tairn away with a curled
upper lip, glaring at Xaden.</p>
<p>“Stop pacing and eat something,” he begs her. “I know you’re hungry
and I can’t stand that you’re hurting this far from magic, so alleviate
some of the pain and go hunt. I’m all right.”</p>
<p>She drops her jaw and roars so loud my ears instantly ring. The glass
doors bow and the little table trembles before she snaps her teeth shut.
Three errisbirds fly out of the tree on my left, and two dark-haired
boys come running out of the house to see what the commotion was.</p>
<p>“Sgaeyl,” Xaden says softly, walking toward the edge of the
veranda.</p>
<p>She backs up three heavy steps, and my heart stutters as her hind
claw nearly tramples one of the boys before she launches skyward over
the house. Her tail swings so close, it slices the leaves from the trees
before she disappears.</p>
<p>Good thing the errisbirds left.</p>
<p>“At least she didn’t set you on fire.” Tairn quickly follows and
Andarna trails after, fighting to fully extend her wing.</p>
<p>All of them are struggling without power.</p>
<p>“Fuck.” Xaden’s eyes slide shut.</p>
<p>“Simeon! Gaius!” One of the maids runs out of the house three stories
beneath us, holding her skirts high as she sprints across the sand. “Are
you all right?” she asks in Hedotic.</p>
<p>“That was amazing!” the older boy shouts in kind, lifting his fists
toward the sky.</p>
<p>“We can leave,” I offer Xaden, crossing the distance between us and
winding my arms around his waist. “Right now.”</p>
<p>“My mother is having our uniforms laundered.” He brushes the loose
strands of my braid behind my ears.</p>
<p>“So we’ll be cold. Say the word, and we’ll go.” I turn my cheek and
rest my ear against his heartbeat. “You’re all that matters to me.”</p>
<p>“Same.” He drops his chin to the top of my head. “We can’t just skip
an entire isle,” he grumbles, splaying his hands over my back. “We
disobeyed direct orders to be here.”</p>
<p>“We can.” I listen to the steady rhythm of his heart and watch the
maid fuss over the boys as they walk back toward the house. “The riot
hunts, does a pass to make sure Andarna’s kind hasn’t chosen the
blandest isle ever to call home, and we go. Hedotis hasn’t entered a war
or aligned itself with any kingdom at war in its recorded history. They
aren’t going to help us.” I run my hand up and down his spine. “And you
know where your mother is now. If you ever feel the need, you can come
back. They’re your ten minutes, too.”</p>
<p>“And you’re not hoping—” His words end abruptly as Talia runs out of
the house beneath us, fisting the fabric of her gown.</p>
<p>“Boys!” she screams in Hedotic as she races to the edge of the stone
patio, then yanks the children into her arms. “You’re all right?” She
pulls back and gives them the same once-over I usually earn from Mira
after a battle.</p>
<p>“We’re great!” the older assures her with a wide grin. “Right,
Gaius?”</p>
<p>“Mama, you should have seen it roar!” the younger one adds with a bob
of his head.</p>
<p>Mama. My stomach drops straight out of my body as I hope I have that
word wrong.</p>
<p>Xaden tenses, and I hear his heart begin to race.</p>
<p>“I heard it roar, and that was excitement enough,” Talia tells the
boys, running her hands over their hair and down the sides of their
faces. “But you’re all right. You’re all right,” she repeats with a nod.
“Elda, will you get them cleaned up? The triumvirate is joining us for
dinner, and Faris’s parents would like the boys to spend the night
there.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” the maid replies, then ushers the children into the
house.</p>
<p>Talia remains, her shoulders trembling as she catches her breath.</p>
<p>“What did she say?” Xaden asks.</p>
<p>“The triumvirate is coming to dinner.” I start with the easiest part
first. “And the boys…”</p>
<p>“They’re hers, aren’t they?” His tone slips into icy disdain.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I whisper, holding him tighter as Talia returns to the house
without looking up.</p>
<p>“The older is probably what? Eleven?” His arms drop. “No wonder she
never came back. She didn’t just marry; she built a whole new family.”
There’s nothing amused about his laugh.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry.” I pull back to look at him, but his expression is
flat.</p>
<p>“You did nothing wrong.” He steps out of my arms, and it feels
frighteningly poignant as he slips away. “This feeling is one I would
gladly exchange.”</p>
<p>It’s not just the power that’s addicting; it’s the freedom to not
feel this. His words play back in my head, and a new fear takes root,
burrowing insidiously in the pit of my stomach. Does he know I’ve
brought my new conduit? That there’s a fully charged piece of alloy in
my pack?</p>
<p>“Don’t barter it away,” I beg as he stares at the sea, and the words
spill out of me faster and faster as his eyes harden and he resurrects
the defenses it took me a year to break past. “The pain. The mess. Give
it to me. I’ll hold it. I know that sounds ludicrous, but I’ll find a
way.” I lace our fingers. “I will hold everything you don’t want to feel
because I love every part of you.”</p>
<p>“You already hold my soul and now you want my pain? Getting greedy,
Violence.” He brings my hand to his mouth and brushes a kiss over my
knuckles before letting go. “Fuck it. Dinner with my mother sounds
great. Think I’ll wash up first.”</p>
<p>He leaves me standing on the veranda, my thoughts racing more rapidly
than Tairn could ever fly. The triumvirate is coming to dinner. They’ll
test us tonight. They sent the kids away.</p>
<p>Do they think we’re dangerous? Or are they?</p>
<p>We need an edge. What would Rhi or Brennan do?</p>
<p>Shit. What did I bring with me? Brennan sent the med kit—</p>
<p>Brennan sent the med kit.</p>
<p>I need Mira.</p>
<p>“Andarna, when those boys leave the house, I need you to follow as
invisibly as you can,” I say down the bond.</p>
<p>“Are we scheming? I do enjoy scheming.”</p>
<p>“We’re planning.”</p>
<p>Two hours later, I hold the precious glass vial with both hands as
Mira and I head downstairs. Now is not the time to be clumsy. We quickly
find Talia in the dining room, discussing dinner with a spindly man in a
pale green apron who scrubs at his nails with a blue-edged towel.</p>
<p>“Violet?” Hope lights her eyes, and she dismisses the man before
walking our way. “Did you ask him?” Her gaze darts toward Mira.</p>
<p>My sister folds her arms and studies the table.</p>
<p>“He said dinner sounds great,” I tell Talia. It’s not exactly a lie.
My hands twist around the glass, shielding its contents from view. “The
rest will be flying, but six of us can make it. And I thought this might
serve as a peace offering between us, and maybe…” I press my lips in a
line and look down at the vial.</p>
<p>“Stop debating and just give it to her,” Mira orders with an
exasperated sigh. “My sister is too polite to suggest that it might help
smooth the waters and make tonight a little less awkward for those
involved. Remind Xaden of home and all that.”</p>
<p>Talia lifts her brows, and I hand over the vial and its dehydrated,
light-green leaves. She takes the gift with a bewildered smile. “Is
this…”</p>
<p>“Dried arinmint,” I reply.</p>
<p>Gods bless Brennan.</p>
<p>The god of wisdom is the trickiest to placate.</p>
<p>Hedeon seems to only answer those who do not pray to him.</p>
