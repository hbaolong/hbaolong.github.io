<h4 id="chapter-thirty-one">Chapter Thirty-One</h4>
<p>“Are you dizzy?” Xaden asks in a low whisper.</p>
<p>“No.” My gaze jumping from one attendant to the next as we walk
toward them. They all have different heights, shapes, genders, and skin
tones, but their hair color is as uniform as their blue robes.</p>
<p>One of the attendants on the top step claps her hands, and a group of
children in light-blue tunics runs out from behind the statue of Dunne
to race up the steps toward her. My gaze locks on the last of them, a
girl who looks to be no more than ten. The brunette’s silver-tipped
braid swings against her back as she scoops up a younger child and is
ushered inside.</p>
<p>Breath abandons me as she disappears.</p>
<p>“Violet,” Xaden whispers. “Her hair—”</p>
<p>“I know.” I wobble, and he steadies me with a hand on my lower
back.</p>
<p>Never in my twenty-one years have I seen anyone with hair like mine.
Does hers always end in silver no matter how short she cuts it? Do her
joints fail her? Do her bones break? I need to know. I have to know.</p>
<p>The cavalry captain shouts up at the walls as Tairn prowls above us,
and the attendants all draw blades from the belts at their waists,
jarring me from my spiraling thoughts.</p>
<p>“He said, ‘I’ve brought them,’” Dain translates from Xaden’s left as
we form a straight line on the cusp of what feels like a theater floor.
Or a battle briefing stage.</p>
<p>“The blades are cute,” Tairn remarks.</p>
<p>“The hair,” I reply. “Her hair looked like mine.”</p>
<p>“Survive first so you can be curious later. Focus.”</p>
<p>Metal creaks, and a gate rises above the highest row on our left. A
moment later, two people step out of the tunnel.</p>
<p>“Xaden’s opponent?” I ask Tairn.</p>
<p>“Not unless he’s fighting an aging general and a high priestess.”</p>
<p>The middle-aged man with graying hair and rich brown skin on the left
boasts the same uniform as the silver-dressed guards, and the older,
light-skinned woman at his side wears not only the long pale blue robes
of the temple attendants but a sword sheathed at her hip.</p>
<p>Her narrowed gaze sweeps over us, then fixes on me as the man calls
out in Unnbrish at her left.</p>
<p>“He says he is the commander of the guard and asks if we truly wish
an audience with their queen,” Dain translates.</p>
<p>“Tell him we do, and we will comply with their customs to get it,” I
answer, sending up a prayer to Dunne that Xaden is ready for this.</p>
<p>Dain translates slowly, and the pair moves down the steps as the
cavalry captain climbs to join them. The captain reports, and the
commander’s mouth flattens before he draws his dagger and slices through
the shoulder straps of the captain’s leather armor.</p>
<p>The green leather falls to the steps, and the captain lowers his
head.</p>
<p>“I think that means demotion,” Cat whispers to Aaric’s right.</p>
<p>“In every language,” Aaric agrees.</p>
<p>The commander’s voice booms across the plaza and echoes off the rock
as he descends the steps, and Dain translates as quickly as he can.</p>
<p>“‘All we can achieve is death, but to…’” Dain pauses. “Shit, I think
he said to provide our strongest warriors, and they will test our
worthiness to speak with their queen.”</p>
<p>Xaden nods. “Tell him I’m ready.”</p>
<p>Dain repeats the message, and the commander claps twice. Three
bare-armed soldiers step out of the tunnel, and my chest tightens. The
woman in the middle has to be the same height as Sawyer, if not Dain,
and the bulky men flanking her tower above with the same height
difference I have with Xaden. I think they’re twins.</p>
<p>The chill that races down my spine has nothing to do with the gusting
wind or the disappearance of the sun behind the storm clouds
overhead.</p>
<p>“Maybe we should rethink this strategy,” Cat whispers.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’m with her for once.</p>
<p>“What you call strategy, they call law,” Xaden replies.</p>
<p>My heart beats faster with every step the warriors descend behind
their commander and the high priestess of the temple. By the time they
reach the plaza, a hummingbird could time its wings to my pulse.</p>
<p>“Costa!” the guards along the walls cry out, and the warrior on the
right lifts his muscle-laden arms.</p>
<p>“Marlis!” the rest of the guards shout, and the woman raises her
chin.</p>
<p>“Palta!” Another chorus sounds, and the twin on the left cracks his
neck.</p>
<p>The commander lifts his hand, and the soldiers fall silent before he
speaks.</p>
<p>“He asks if this is our champion or our leader,” Dain translates.</p>
<p>“Close but no. He asked if Xaden is our champion or our prince. Don’t
be embarrassed, Aetos. The words sound similar enough.” Aaric steps
forward, then replies to the commander in what sounds like flawless
Unnbrish.</p>
<p>My jaw drops, but he speaks too fast to understand anything other
than “Navarre.”</p>
<p>Whatever he says gives the commander and the priestess pause before
she replies, her gaze darting to me again.</p>
<p>“Are you fucking serious?” Dain snaps. “Why didn’t you tell us you’re
fluent?”</p>
<p>“You never asked.” Aaric reaches for the pommel of his sword as he
turns back to face us. “I told them who I am and that I’d be the one
fighting.”</p>
<p>“You what?” My voice rises with my panic.</p>
<p>“I’m the one who needs the audience,” he replies. “I’m not my
brother, nor my father, and I won’t hide while someone else—” He draws
the first few inches of the sharpened steel.</p>
<p>“No!” I move toward him, but Xaden’s there first, covering Aaric’s
hand.</p>
<p>“Prince or not, you’re a fucking first-year and we both know I can
put you into the ground. Your tutors are no match for real-life
experience.” He forces the sword back into its scabbard. “And no, you
are not your father, nor your brother, which is precisely why you will
not fight. We need you to live. Your kingdom needs you to live.” Xaden
grabs the collar of Aaric’s uniform and pivots, forcing him back into
line next to me. “Tell them I’m ready.”</p>
<p>Fuck, I don’t want either of them in that ring.</p>
<p>“Every possible path,” Andarna reminds me. “Even if my kind aren’t
here, they may have seen them. May know of them.”</p>
<p>“Do not consider the Dark One,” Tairn chides. “Navarre needs the
soldiers from this alliance to defend the borders, freeing the riders to
go on the offensive.”</p>
<p>Either way, someone’s fighting.</p>
<p>“Same could be said for you.” Color rises along Aaric’s neck, and he
shakes his head at Xaden.</p>
<p>“Tyrrendor is safe in Bodhi’s hands should I fall.” Xaden lowers his
voice, and my stomach sours at the thought. “This isn’t about honor.
Consider it your revenge. Remember what I did to your brother and tell
them.”</p>
<p>Blood runs from my face. Xaden isn’t talking about Halden.</p>
<p>Aaric says something in Unnbrish, glaring at Xaden the entire
time.</p>
<p>Xaden lets go of him, then checks with Dain.</p>
<p>“He said you’re the strongest,” Dain admits, then translates again as
the commander begins to speak. “And they have chosen Costa as your
opponent.”</p>
<p>One of the twins. I look past Xaden to see the warrior already
standing in the middle of the plaza next to the priestess. He’s more
terrifying up close than he had been walking down the steps. Thick neck.
Huge arms. Gleefully menacing smile. He’s a walking arsenal, strapped
with weaponry, and the scars up and down his tanned arms tell me he
isn’t a stranger to pain. The assumption is confirmed when the priestess
scores the back of his forearm with a dagger and he doesn’t so much as
flinch.</p>
<p>Blood drips from the spot, spattering the dark stones beneath as the
first rain drop hits my face, and the soldiers behind us cheer.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t in my father’s book.” My stomach sinks with suspicion of
how those stones became the shade they are and the ever-growing fear
that Xaden may have met his match.</p>
<p>“Incoming,” Dain announces, and Xaden turns to face the priestess as
she approaches, passing by Marlis and Palta.</p>
<p>The tattoo of Dunne’s emblem inked into her forehead crinkles as she
lifts her silver brows at Xaden and holds out her hand. “The Goddess of
War demands her payment before you may prove your worth,” she says in
the common language.</p>
<p>She must be at least seventy-five years old. How long would it take
for such a tattoo to fade to the point it’s unrecognizable? My stomach
lurches into my throat. There’s no way—</p>
<p>“Focus,” Tairn snaps like a frustrated professor.</p>
<p>Xaden shrugs out of his double scabbard, then his uniform top,
leaving him in a short-sleeve undershirt as he holds out his left
forearm. The high priestess draws the blade across his skin, and I sink
my teeth into my bottom lip as blood flows, then drops onto the stones
beside his boots. This isn’t right. Every cell in my body rebels against
the thought of him going out there alone. Xaden can’t read Costa’s
intentions—he doesn’t have the edge his second signet gives him. The
collar of my uniform feels too tight, the leather too sticky in the
growing humidity, its warmth too suffocating. I tear at the top button,
then shove my sleeves up my forearms as thunder sounds in the distance,
mocking my inability to wield it.</p>
<p>I want my fucking power back now. With them, Xaden isn’t the
deadliest in this plaza. I am. He’s only out there because of me, and I
should be the one taking on this fight.</p>
<p>Xaden faces me, then holds out his uniform top.</p>
<p>“He’s huge,” I whisper, our gazes colliding as I take the warm fabric
from his hands and hug it to my chest.</p>
<p>“I know.” He slides his arms into the double scabbard and buckles it
across his chest. “Garrick is going to be pissed he missed this.” He
smirks, then cups the back of my neck and presses a soft, lingering kiss
to my lips. “Be right back.”</p>
<p>But what if he’s not? Even the best fighters die in combat.</p>
<p>He’s arrogant because he’s the best. At least that’s what I tell
myself to slow my pounding heart as he walks toward Costa. The heat of
anger swiftly replaces fear as the priestess moves to my side. I
understand passing tests—I’d prepared my entire life to face the
entrance exam for the Scribe’s Quadrant—but this feels just as callous
as walking the parapet on Conscription Day.</p>
<p>“You don’t agree with Dunne’s ways,” the priestess surmises, her
voice cracking with age as she looks down at me with dilated pupils. Oh
great. Only Dunne herself knows what they’re ingesting beyond those
pillars.</p>
<p>“I find it a poor test of character,” I reply.</p>
<p>“And yet character is always revealed in bloodshed, is it not?” The
priestess looks my way and crosses in front of Aaric, her gaze
appraising him, then Cat before turning her attention to Dain. “They’ll
negotiate weapons now.”</p>
<p>“He’s fighting without his greatest one.” I watch Xaden’s back as he
approaches Costa and the commander.</p>
<p>“I think you may be right about that.” The priestess glances up at
the wall where Sgaeyl stands watch. “Which is why I have decided he
should not fight alone.” Before I can question her, she drags the blade
over Dain’s arm, cutting through his uniform.</p>
<p>Oh shit.</p>
<p>He hisses in surprise, then grabs hold of the wound. Blood flows
through his fingers, dripping onto the stone.</p>
<p>“No!” I shout, reaching for Dain.</p>
<p>“Gods,” Cat whispers.</p>
<p>“All right.” Dain nods.</p>
<p>Xaden turns toward us, lines carved between his eyebrows, and I reach
for our bond out of habit, coming up woefully empty again.</p>
<p>“I forbid it.” Aaric moves closer to my side and draws his sword.
“I’ll fight in his stead.”</p>
<p>“You can’t.” I shake my head. What is with the fucking death wishes
around here?</p>
<p>The corners of the priestess’s eyes crinkle with a soft smile. “See?
Character is revealed in bloodshed.” She looks at Cat. “You’re an
outsider, dressed differently than the others, yet your presence means
they value you.” Her gaze snaps to Aaric, and she tilts her head. “You
are the prince of your people, honorable yet foolish to think you could
survive our finest. Do you not know what would happen to those pretty
green eyes should you step foot on this battlefield? Even if you
accepted your death, Dunne has not chosen you to prove your skill this
day.”</p>
<p>Aaric’s jaw ticks.</p>
<p>“You are the smallest,” she says to me dismissively, then turns to
Dain. “Which leaves you to fight beside your champion.”</p>
<p>“Dain…” Words fail me. If anything happens to him because of my
decisions…</p>
<p>“This just got interesting,” Tairn notes.</p>
<p>“This is not interesting. This is terrifying.” I snap my reply.</p>
<p>“I’ve got this.” Dain slips out of his uniform top and hands it to
me. “I knew what I was getting into when I agreed to come with you.”</p>
<p>My ribs strain, but I nod. “Be careful.” I add his top to the pile,
and he starts toward Xaden, who’s already moving to intercept him
halfway.</p>
<p>“Palta!” the priestess shouts, her voice echoing off the stone. The
guards clamor in approval as the second twin steps forward, blood
already dripping from his fingertips.</p>
<p>My gaze flies to the remaining warrior, Marlis, but thankfully
there’s no cut on her folded arms.</p>
<p>“Tell me, did you choose this path yourself?” The priestess brings
her weathered gaze to mine.</p>
<p>“My mother—” I start, but then I remember every time Dain tried to
get me out of the quadrant, and I face forward as he and Xaden approach
their opponents to negotiate weapons. “I chose my life.”</p>
<p>“Ah, then it is good we did not complete your dedication.”</p>
<p>“My what?” What kind of drugs do they provide in the temples
here?</p>
<p>“But do you not yearn for temple? Usually the touch creates such
longing that you can’t help but return. Or perhaps you now favor another
god.” She glances up at Tairn, ignoring my outburst, and then her eyes
slide to Xaden. “I still see us among your potential paths, should you
decide to take it. Dunne will accept you. It is not too late to choose
Her.”</p>
<p>I raise my eyebrows at the woman. “I choose him.” Whether she’s
talking about Xaden or Tairn, my answer is the same.</p>
<p>“Ah.” She turns the dagger in her gnarled hand as the raindrops
continue to fall. “So be it. Our goddess teaches that while battles may
be won by the strongest warriors, they may also be lost by our weakest.
Both must be tested today.”</p>
<p>Pain erupts in my forearm, and a second later, she lifts the dagger
as fresh blood races down its honed edge.</p>
<p>My blood. Looks like I get to fight after all.</p>
<p>With such wan coloring in the vegetation, it comes as no surprise
that it requires four times the amount of indigo to dye even the
simplest garment. I can’t help but wonder if the colors of our Continent
are the exception, or if the isles are.</p>
