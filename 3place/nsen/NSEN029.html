<h4 id="chapter-twenty-seven">Chapter Twenty-Seven</h4>
<p>Guards move in and everything goes to complete, immediate shit.</p>
<p>Xaden draws both his swords, then surprises the hell out of me by
tossing one across the gap to Halden, who catches it with his left hand
in the same breath that I palm two of my daggers.</p>
<p>We are not dying tonight.</p>
<p>“Try not to kill anyone,” Xaden says, even as the first of the guards
charges up the steps between the panthers. “International relations and
all.”</p>
<p>“Tell her that.” I glance down at the panther, thankful she’s still
occupied. “Do not overreact,” I warn Tairn, hoping it’s not my final
request. “We still need this deal.”</p>
<p>“I resent the implication that I am given to melodramatics,” he
replies, but there’s a distinct, plate-rattling roar to my left that
causes more than a few guests to shriek as Xaden clashes blades with the
guard, then kicks him clean off the stairs with a boot to the center of
his chest.</p>
<p>I whirl to the left as a guard climbs the end of the dais without
stairs and pull a move from Courtlyn’s own book, thrusting my dagger
through her hand and yanking it out. She shouts, falling backward, and
when I rise, I find two more guards have managed the same maneuver
behind us, filling the space between Xaden and me.</p>
<p>Bone crunches and a body flies around the guards, but there’s easily
a half dozen more waiting beyond the panthers.</p>
<p>The closest guard has at least a foot on me and fifty pounds, and if
the scars on his forearms are any measure, he’s no stranger to fighting.
But he’s no Xaden.</p>
<p>I charge before he can take a fighting stance and let muscle memory
take over, my first cut landing deep in the outside of his thigh before
I duck close, avoiding the swing of his long spear. They aren’t made for
close combat, and I am.</p>
<p>He misses, thrusting the spear into the table, shattering glass, and
giving me the time to regretfully slice the tendons behind his knee.
It’s a long-lasting injury for a warrior, but at least it won’t kill
him.</p>
<p>He bellows, toppling sideways and falling from the dais, but before I
can get up, pain explodes at the back of my head, and I’m yanked
upward…by my godsdamned braid.</p>
<p>A battering ram of an arm shoves my chest onto the bloodied plate
between our packs, and my face narrowly misses a sharp shard of glass.
The spear shattered my conduit. “Do your dragons scream before they die,
fire-bringer?” the guard hisses in my ear as she leans over my back.
“Does it take them minutes to perish after you do? Or is it
instant?”</p>
<p>Anger storms through my veins, heating my skin from the scalp down in
a flood of smelted rage. “Your ignorance is staggering.”</p>
<p>Gods bless my flexibility, I swing my left arm behind my back and
stab deep into her arm.</p>
<p>She shouts, jerking upright, and I shove the heel of my hand against
the table and throw every ounce of my energy into jolting backward,
slamming my head into her face. Bone crunches, and her weight
disappears.</p>
<p>I turn, only to meet the stunning blow of an elbow against my
cheekbone. Skin splits, my ears ring, and I fall back against the table,
blinking the stars out of my eyes as a hand grabs hold of my throat and
squeezes.</p>
<p>“Violet!” Xaden yells, and I slash my blade across the offending arm
and thrust my knee in a move even Mira would be proud of. The man falls
and I cough for my first breath as the dais shudders.</p>
<p>I lift my blade toward the giant on my right, but the pommel of a
sword reaches his temple first. The man collapses, and Xaden shoves him
off the platform with his foot.</p>
<p>“That is enough,” Tairn declares.</p>
<p>“She holds her own,” Andarna argues. “Oh. Perhaps there are now too
many.”</p>
<p>“Stop playing and end this! It’s the only way to kill their mounts!”
Courtlyn shouts from behind us.</p>
<p>Xaden reaches for my face with his empty hand, cupping my chin and
turning my cheek toward the blue light as a dozen more guards pour in
from behind Courtlyn. I take a precious second to make sure Halden’s
still alive. He’s on the ground, chest moving, eyes closed—I think he
might be unconscious, but I don’t see any blood.</p>
<p>“Xaden, behind us,” I warn as he studies the wound that has begun to
throb. When he doesn’t answer, my gaze jumps to his, and my breath
falters.</p>
<p>I’ve seen him in battle before, seen the icy rage that comes over
him, even the killing calm. I’ve witnessed the transformation from man
to weapon, watched strategy overtake compassion—just like we’re trained
for.</p>
<p>But this…whatever’s swirling in those onyx eyes is a tempest I’ve
never beheld. It’s one step past fury, as though Dunne herself has
stepped into his eyes and now peers back at me. He’s Xaden, but
he’s…not.</p>
<p>“Xaden?” I whisper. “It’s nothing. Really. I’ve had worse on a
sparring mat.”</p>
<p>“They’re all fucking dead.” His vow lifts the hair at the back of my
neck, and the guards rush the table simultaneously with their weapons
drawn, obviously having learned from the last failed assault.</p>
<p>Two on…twelve. Shit.</p>
<p>I startle and pull back to fight, but Xaden whips his arm around my
waist and yanks me against his chest. His sword hits the table, and to
my complete and utter surprise, he presses a soft kiss to the top of my
forehead as an axe—</p>
<p>Metal hits the ground.</p>
<p>Screams sound around us, and I jerk my head left, finding Xaden’s
outstretched hand mid-twist. The unmistakable sound of cracking bone
follows, and every guard surrounding us drops to the floor, their heads
twisted at unnatural angles.</p>
<p>Wisps of barely there shadow dissipate, and the band around my waist
falls away with a familiar caress.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Silence falls, thicker than the cloying, humid air, and my heart
cries, demanding some other answer than the one my brain already knows
because there’s only one logical explanation for what just happened—but
even that can’t be possible because there’s no magic here.</p>
<p>Tairn bristles along the bond, and Andarna shudders. I can feel them
both, closer than they should be, but there’s still no bond to
Xaden.</p>
<p>“Y-y-you…” Courtlyn stammers. “What have you done?”</p>
<p>I drag my gaze along the wall of rustling palms to the left, over the
scattered dead Deverelli guards and the panthers that happily
investigate them, and across Xaden’s chest, finding nothing but the same
on the other side of the table.</p>
<p>He’s killed all dozen of them.</p>
<p>It’s only muscle memory that sheathes my daggers.</p>
<p>Something falls from his hand, hitting his abandoned sword with a
metallic clink. I grab the small object on impulse and close my fingers
around the pebble-size piece of alloy from my conduit. Agony cracks my
soul clean open, as if I can give Xaden some of what he’s just lost as I
register the alloy’s chill, its complete and total lack of energy before
shoving it in my front pocket.</p>
<p>“They hurt you,” he whispers without apology. “They were going to
kill you.”</p>
<p>The why of it doesn’t matter. Not right now. Not when we’re
surrounded on an enemy isle, escorted by riders who don’t know what
Xaden’s become, and facing down Navarrian royalty who would gladly see
him dead.</p>
<p>Why is a matter for later.</p>
<p>“Violet.” The plea in his whisper pulls me together faster than
anything else could, and I jerk my head up. His eyes are tightly closed
as he rubs the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>“Come here,” I say quietly, rising on my toes and cupping the side of
his face, lifting my hands to his temples to shield him from view.
Courtlyn’s chair squeaks on the dais. “Look at me.”</p>
<p>Xaden’s eyes flash open. Red rims his irises and consumes the gold
flecks I adore so very much, but he’s still him behind these eyes. I
force my body not to react, then pull his forehead to mine. “I love you
and we need to get you out of here, so you have to trust me. Do not move
until I tell you.”</p>
<p>He nods.</p>
<p>“Sit down. Put your head in your hands and stay there.” I let him go,
and he does exactly as I ask, keeping his head low as if he’s ashamed of
what he’s done.</p>
<p>“I need help,” I tell Tairn and Andarna.</p>
<p>“We’re ready,” Tairn replies. Thank gods they’re always in my
head.</p>
<p>“Andarna, when it’s time, be gentle.” For once, I don’t even want to
lecture her about not staying home when she’s told, though she’d better
have her harness on if this doesn’t go as planned.</p>
<p>“Is your lightning gentle? Do I critique your work?” She huffs.</p>
<p>Courtlyn still stands behind the table, one of the panthers at his
side, panic etched in every line of his face as the court mutters in
muted tones of hysteria behind us.</p>
<p>“I need you to get Sgaeyl as close as possible,” I tell Tairn, then
offer what I hope is a contrite smile Courtlyn’s way. “Our most sincere
apology, but in Navarre, riders are trained to kill when you attack us,
and our restraint can only be pushed so far. As you can see, the duke
feels some remorse, but you did just try to murder two of our kingdom’s
nobles.” I cringe. “Not a good look for negotiations. Shall we begin
round two? I’ll lead this time.”</p>
<p>“We have no magic.” Courtlyn’s eyes widen, and his gaze darts over
the room, as if he’s deciding whether or not to call for more
guards.</p>
<p>“Watch your words,” Tairn warns. “Sgaeyl is here. It’s getting
cramped behind these trees.”</p>
<p>“And yet here we are. Did you know that I’m a lightning wielder?” I
cock my head to the side.</p>
<p>Courtlyn swallows. “Tecarus mentioned something along those
lines.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” Halden sits up with perfect timing, rubbing a
growing lump on his head.</p>
<p>Courtlyn’s chest rises and falls more rapidly with every second, and
I watch the panic build within him like a breaking dam ready to burst. I
drop my right hand to my sheaths and wait for him to explode. “Shira!”
he bellows, snapping faster than I expected.</p>
<p>“Violet!” Halden shouts, and Xaden’s back turns to stone beneath my
hand, but true to his word, he doesn’t move a muscle.</p>
<p>Neither do I.</p>
<p>“No!” Courtlyn shrieks, his eyes locking behind me in horror. His
mouth falls agape, and the group of Deverelli erupts into full-blown
multitoned cries of distress.</p>
<p>“You stay put and she lives,” I warn him as people run for their
lives, emptying out the hall.</p>
<p>“Well, holy shit,” Halden says with lifted eyebrows, wobbling as he
stands.</p>
<p>I look over my shoulder, and a slow, proud smile spreads across my
face. Andarna stands with her front claws atop the bodies of the guards,
her wings tucked in tight, her black tail flicking back and forth as she
holds Shira delicately between her front four teeth, the snarling cat’s
claws safely tucked outside so she can’t cause any damage. Andarna even
has her lips puckered so the little cat doesn’t get drenched in dragon
saliva. How thoughtful.</p>
<p>“Shira…” Courtlyn cries.</p>
<p>“You see, that’s my little one.” I pivot toward Courtlyn with a grin,
wrinkling my nose. “Raised her from a juvenile—well, Tairn and Sgaeyl
have, really, but you get the point. Now, Andarna doesn’t eat our
allies—it’s a whole thing her elders are trying to teach her—but you
know how adolescents are. Never really know if they feel like listening
on any given day.” I shrug. “So we can negotiate, and I will give you
the rarest treasure found anywhere on this world and Shira will walk
away in need of a good bath, or I can call Tairn and Sgaeyl in here, and
they can all have little panther snacks before we fly back to the
Continent. Your choice. But either way, you should know that dragons
outlive their riders, so had you succeeded in killing us, all you would
have done was really piss them off before they scorched everything in
their paths and flew back to tell the rest of the Empyrean what you’d
done. I’m willing to let the Duke of Tyrrendor depart in good faith that
you won’t try to attack us again if you’re ready to begin.”</p>
<p>Courtlyn’s face falls, and for the first time since we walked in, he
actually looks his age as he glances at Xaden. “Agreed.”</p>
<p>“My king!” someone yells from behind me.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, Burcet!” Courtlyn calls back. “My trade minister will
stay for negotiations, along with finance and”—he looks their
way—“foreign.”</p>
<p>“As it should be.” I nod, then hold out my hand to Halden. “Bring me
both of his weapons.”</p>
<p>Halden’s head draws back in offense.</p>
<p>“Now,” I add, just in case he thinks I’m kidding.</p>
<p>“Way to fuck up the negotiations, Riorson.” He glares and tosses them
over.</p>
<p>The steel lands on the table with a clatter, and I make quick work of
sheathing Xaden’s swords at his back and packaging the dagger in his bag
with the Sword of Tyrrendor.</p>
<p>“All ready.” I tap Xaden’s back and he stands, turning away from
Courtlyn and Halden before swinging his pack over his shoulder.</p>
<p>He keeps his head low but opens his eyes to look at me. “I’m not
sorry, but I am.”</p>
<p>“I love you.” I cup the sides of his face and choose my words
carefully. “Sgaeyl is just behind the trees. Take the heirlooms back to
Aretia and handle whatever business you might have there for the
province.” My throat tightens as I hold his gaze, beating back the
physical instinct to fight or flee at the glimpse of red. I rise up
quickly and press a hard, quick kiss to his mouth. “I’ll see you at
Basgiath in a week.”</p>
<p>“A week,” he promises, and then he goes, hanging his head as he
descends the dais, then lifting it when he passes Andarna and striding
through the trees like the arrogant ass he is.</p>
<p>I pivot back to Courtlyn, noting that his three ministers are picking
their way toward us.</p>
<p>The king’s gaze narrows on me in a glare that’s equal parts hatred
and appreciation. “Are you nervous now that your reckless one has
departed?”</p>
<p>I clear my throat, and the ground shakes as Tairn steps over the
trees, lowering his head so that the table linen moves with his breath.
“No, not particularly. Dragons are known to have short tempers, and
Andarna’s jaw is probably getting a little tired, so we should speed
this along, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Courtlyn nods.</p>
<p>“Same terms as the duke stated while I sat beside him earlier this
evening, and I will add that Xaden Riorson is to be pardoned of any
crime you would accuse him of regarding tonight’s activities,
considering he was provoked and attacked by your guards, and he is to be
allowed to return to Deverelli as a member of our riot at any time.” I
flash a smile.</p>
<p>Courtlyn blusters, and his ministers call out protests as they make
their way toward the dais.</p>
<p>“Or we can go home, and I can ask King Tauri how he feels about
tonight’s actions and go from there.” I shrug.</p>
<p>“Accepted,” Courtlyn bites out.</p>
<p>“Excellent. Now, I expect you will accept the citrine as payment for
the alliance but agree you should be compensated for the prince’s
crimes.” I unclasp the top of my pack and remove the hard metallic
shards of shell I’ve carried all the way from the Continent. The
smallest pieces cover my palm, and the largest section would easily fit
a medium-size dog. I set the base on the table and its pieces inside,
marveling at how the shades of color graduate from the darkest onyx on
bottom to the brightest silvers on top, each ring of hardened scales
nestled within the next yet never separate, creating a smooth outer
layer with no ridges that only cracks when the hatchling is ready.</p>
<p>“A dragon egg shell.” Courtlyn drags out the words, less than
impressed. “As amazing as your beasts are, once you’ve seen one shell,
you’ve seen them all.”</p>
<p>“Not this one.” A corner of my mouth lifts, and I run my finger along
the inner edge, picturing her biding her time for hundreds of years,
listening, waiting. A charge of energy runs up my arm, and I lift my
brows at the sensation. “This is the only shell of its kind. It belongs
to the one and only irid we have on the Continent. The seventh breed of
dragon. It is Andarna’s kind we’re searching for.”</p>
<p>“You expect me to believe—” Courtlyn starts, then stands completely
awestruck, staring at Andarna.</p>
<p>I glance back and see she’s chosen to blend with the vegetation so it
appears Shira is hanging in midair, suspended by an unknown pointed
vise. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“And this is her shell.” Courtlyn leans closer.</p>
<p>“It is. She gave me permission to gift it to you.” I push the heavy
structure toward him.</p>
<p>“I’m starting to drool,” she warns me.</p>
<p>“Just a little longer. You’re doing great.”</p>
<p>Courtlyn nods, inspecting the shell. “Yes, yes.” His head pops up.
“One condition. He”—his finger swings toward Halden—“never steps foot on
my isle again or his life is forfeit.”</p>
<p>“Done.”</p>
<p>“Violet!” Halden argues.</p>
<p>“Done,” I repeat to Courtlyn.</p>
<p>“Then the deal is struck.” Courtlyn bows his head.</p>
<p>“The deal is struck.” I bow mine, and Andarna spits Shira out. The
panther bolts past us, taking her sisters with her.</p>
<p>“You will begin at Unnbriel, will you not? It is the closest main
isle, after all.” Courtlyn waits for me to nod, then eyes Andarna’s
shell before stepping around the table toward me. “If you are amenable,
there is another trade I might be able to broker for you.”</p>
<p>“I’m listening.”</p>
<p>There are times I look at Parapet, at the very act of Threshing and
marvel that dragons have not been to Unnbriel. What we call treacherous
is their idea of primary school.</p>
