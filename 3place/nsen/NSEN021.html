<h4 id="chapter-nineteen">Chapter Nineteen</h4>
<p>Four nights later, our riot of eight—now including Mira, thanks to
Halden throwing his royal weight around—crosses the border at Samara,
and magic slips free of the wards’ cage. Power expands in every
direction, running like a current that rushes around me, beckoning me to
play…or destroy. My skin tingles as we slip down into the valleys
through the Esbens, and I’m struck with the oddest urge to try and pluck
strands from the very sky and weave runes.</p>
<p>“It feels like there’s more power out here than usual,” I tell Tairn
as we dive along a ridgeline.</p>
<p>“There’s actually less—the venin saw to that,” he replies. “But you
grow more powerful every day, more capable of recognizing what once was
entirely invisible to you.”</p>
<p>“I could recognize it,” Andarna chimes in. “If you ever let me come
with you.”</p>
<p>“With Theophanie hunting you, you’re far safer at Samara.” I grip the
pommels as Tairn levels out along the riverbank, sticking to the shadows
the overcast night has provided. I swear, there’s a permanent bruise
just below my sternum from trying to sleep in the saddle. This thing
could use some modifications before we head to Deverelli.</p>
<p>“But you’re not,” Andarna argues, her voice fading the farther we
fly. “I can burn venin.”</p>
<p>“I’ve told you a dozen times, first fire burns the hottest, which
could explain the phenomenon,” Tairn replies. “This mission is dangerous
enough without adding a desirable target for any lurking dark
wielders.”</p>
<p>“They’re all busy to the south…” Her voice trails off as the
connection is severed.</p>
<p>“We have about twelve hours before you’ll start to feel the pain of
distance from Andarna,” Tairn reminds me as we cut through the night,
opening the conversation to Sgaeyl and Xaden’s pathways.</p>
<p>I have no desire to test the three-to-four-day limit that riders and
their dragons can be apart, nor to suffer the fatal consequences. Three
hours to Anca. One hour to locate the citrine. Three hours back. A third
of the riot stationed at Samara launched an offensive against a known
stronghold just north of the fortress an hour ago, which allowed us to
slip through the red line on Battle Brief’s map unnoticed by the enemy.
Everything is going according to plan.</p>
<p>Three hours later, it feels almost a little too easy as we land in
the desiccated village square of what had once been Anca. Definitely not
occupied. Other than evading two patrols of wyvern by staying low, we
haven’t seen a single enemy, only sparse villages and dimly lit
encampments of civilians between the land the venin drained in their
advance toward Samara. Tairn sets his claws down first as usual, despite
being told to hang back in formation by Grady, and the rest follow suit
around the withered remains of a clock tower.</p>
<p>“Just because I accepted the terms of the mission does not mean I
like them.” Tairn grumbles low in his chest as I bundle my flight jacket
with the pack at the edge of my saddle and dismount.</p>
<p>“I know.” My feet hit the ground, and everything feels…off without
the presence of magic. According to our latest intel, wielding within
drained territory isn’t just challenging, but it seems to draw venin, so
I let the conduit fall along my wrist, keeping it close just in case
everything goes to shit. “Stick to the plan. I’ll let you know when we
have it.”</p>
<p>Tairn bends, then launches high above the crumbling two-story
buildings, and is quickly joined by the rest of the dragons, two of whom
bear the riders Grady chose to do recon from above—Pugh and Foley.</p>
<p>Xaden strides past the clock tower, heading my way. He’s done a good
job of masking his discomfort, but I can see the struggle in his eyes
and the curl of his fingers.</p>
<p>“You should have taken the sentry assignment,” I tell him as Grady
gathers the others to my left.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t leaving you on the ground.” Our hands nearly brush as we
turn and walk toward the group, but we’re careful not to touch,
especially with how Aura Beinhaven narrows her eyes in our direction.
“And it’s not like I’m risking anything as long as I remain calm, cool,
and collected within the perimeter. The magic is long since
drained.”</p>
<p>Which is why the dragons are in the sky, flying over the land the
dark wielders left untouched in their haste to reach Samara.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell…” Grady flips the hand-drawn map over. “Her handwriting
is atrocious.”</p>
<p>“It looks like that way,” Captain Henson notes, leaning in to see and
pointing across the village square.</p>
<p>“Which is why you should have brought Cat like Violet asked.” Mira
plucks the map straight out of Grady’s hand and studies it.</p>
<p>“Gryphons can’t keep up,” Grady reminds us. “And this mission will
serve as a trial run for all those that follow. An extra member would
have thrown off the dynamic.”</p>
<p>“What fucking dynamic?” I ask Xaden. “I loathe Aura, don’t really
trust Grady after he fed us the serum during RSC training, and don’t
know the rest of them.”</p>
<p>“Calm. Cool. Collected.” Xaden slides his hands into his pockets.</p>
<p>“Really? I don’t see a prince or his guards here, let alone anyone
representing Poromiel. And stop whispering like they can hear you.” Mira
rotates the map and lines up the landmarks Cat sketched out. “The area
is deserted, and we’ll be fine as long as our sentries intercept any
wayward patrols and no one wields.” Mira points past my right shoulder.
“It’s this way.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take that, Lieutenant.” Grady snatches the map back.</p>
<p>“If I didn’t know better, I’d think you were setting the mission up
to fail.” Mira offers a cutting smile.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Grady glares my sister’s way, then stalks past me in the
direction she pointed.</p>
<p>“If it makes any difference,” Captain Henson says, glancing at Mira
as she passes, “I agree with you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t.” Aura pushes up the sleeves of her uniform and runs by. “We
can’t trust the fliers.”</p>
<p>“And yet it’s their artifact that Cat is helping us find,” I mutter
as we follow.</p>
<p>“Cool. Calm. Collected.” Xaden scans every building we pass.</p>
<p>“New mantra since becoming duke?” Mira asks, surveying the remains of
what looks to have been a marketplace on our right.</p>
<p>“Just trying not to explode on Grady and ruin our little trial run
here,” Xaden replies.</p>
<p>The village is silent as we walk the abandoned streets, passing the
desiccated remains of people every block or so. It reminds me of a
sandcastle. The structure is there, but so delicate that even a harsh
breeze might crumble the colorless structure.</p>
<p>We turn at the next intersection, entering narrow columns of
residential rowhouses with barely enough room for wagons to pass each
other in the street. Some of the houses connect to ones across the way
with covered bridges, creating a tunnel effect every twenty feet or
so.</p>
<p>“Ironic that they built these so tight to keep dragons from fitting
between them, and yet it’s dragons that might save us,” I remark,
studying what’s left of the architecture.</p>
<p>“A gryphon would fit with no problem as long as its wings were
tucked,” Mira notes.</p>
<p>“This is the one.” Grady stops in front of an expansive house.</p>
<p>“Was it the plaque that says Home of Amelia, First of the Drifts that
gave it away?” Xaden asks, nodding toward the right side of the
door.</p>
<p>Grady’s mouth tightens. “You know your places. Let’s go.” The front
door creaks loudly enough to wake the dead as he swings it open, and
everyone freezes.</p>
<p>My stomach does its best to displace my lungs, and I clench my fists
when power immediately rises in my veins, responding to my fear.</p>
<p>“They can’t hear us,” Mira repeats, then clasps my shoulder as she
walks by, heading to Grady and Henson.</p>
<p>“Be right back,” Xaden says, but there’s no usual brush of his hand
or shadow along my lower back because Aura is watching like we might
just start making out at any second.</p>
<p>The four officers disappear into the creaky house, leaving Aura and
me in the middle of the street.</p>
<p>“I’ll take south,” I tell her, moving toward the doorway, then facing
in that direction.</p>
<p>“Fine.” She puts her back to me, and we begin watch.</p>
<p>Rumblings sound from within the house, and moonlight illuminates the
cobblestone street.</p>
<p>I look to see the clouds breaking as the wind picks up.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>“Stay out of sight,” I tell Tairn.</p>
<p>“I am as the night.” He sounds more than a little offended. “It is
Dagolh you should worry about.”</p>
<p>Aura’s Red Clubtail.</p>
<p>“Any luck?” I ask Xaden.</p>
<p>“This whole place is a museum, and Cat only remembers that it was on
display upstairs in a protective case. Not sure if you’ve noticed, but
there’s a lot of upstairs,” he answers.</p>
<p>I glance up at the five stories that look ready to topple at any
second. “We’re going to be out here awhile.” This is exactly why we
should have brought Cat. Maybe being here would have triggered the
memory of exactly where it was displayed.</p>
<p>“Great.” Aura shifts nervously behind me, her shadow swaying near my
feet.</p>
<p>“You scared?” I ask as nicely as possible.</p>
<p>“We’re hundreds of miles from the wards, standing in a fucking
cemetery,” she snaps. “What do you think?”</p>
<p>“As someone who has spent my share of time beyond the wards, it’s
healthy to be nervous.” Something rattles up ahead, and I tilt my head,
focusing in that direction. A glass bottle rolls down the gently sloped
hill of a street, propelled by a gust of wind before lodging itself in a
doorway four houses over. “See? That’s—” I glance over my shoulder, then
whip my entire body around to face Aura. “What the fuck?”</p>
<p>“Just being prepared.” She stands with her hands raised, a
flintstrike device between thumb and forefinger, fear pinching her
face.</p>
<p>“That”—I motion to her hands—“is an unhealthy, mission-dangerous
amount of fear. Put them down. Away. Gloves on. You need to remind
yourself that wielding is the worst possible thing we could do.”</p>
<p>“No.” She lifts her chin. “Getting drained is far worse. I’m not
about to be caught off guard. In fact, you should stand ready, too.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not.” I shake my head and turn my back on her. “My orders
are not to wield unless there’s an imminent threat of death, and I
hardly think that bottle constitutes such.”</p>
<p>“As your senior wingleader, I’m ordering you to stand ready,” Aura
seethes. “What use are you as our ‘greatest weapon’ if you can’t wield
at a moment’s notice?”</p>
<p>“The only rank that matters out here is cadet, so with all due
respect, fuck off.” I shrug and roll my shoulders, trying to dispel the
tide of energy pushing against my Archives door. At least that means
Tairn has located some undrained land.</p>
<p>“Found it!” Mira calls through an open window.</p>
<p>I blow out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The door across the street swings open with an ear-screeching creak,
and my head whips toward the sound, fear launching my heart into my
throat as a figure steps out of the shadows—</p>
<p>“Vi, watch out! Aura’s going to—” Xaden starts.</p>
<p>“Don’t!” I pivot and throw myself at Aura, but the damage has been
done.</p>
<p>Fire sparks and spews from her hand like dragon flame and engulfs the
doorway.</p>
<p>We land in a tangle of limbs, and I narrowly keep from smacking my
head on the stone of the stoop as a wave of heat blasts the side of my
face, lighting up the night. Dread seizes my heartbeat, but I cut it off
before it can take hold or, worse, freeze me with fear.</p>
<p>“Get off me!” Aura bellows, shoving me aside as the figure stumbles
forward into the moonlight and screams.</p>
<p>I gasp, and for a millisecond, fear wins.</p>
<p>Captain Grady is on fire.</p>
<p>“No!” Aura scrambles across the stone as he kneels in the center of
the street. Every inch of the leathers that should help protect him is
covered in foot-high flames.</p>
<p>And we don’t have a water or ice wielder on the ground.</p>
<p>“Xaden!” I yell, gaining my feet and running toward the captain.
“Aura! Take off your flight jacket!” We can smother the flames. We have
to.</p>
<p>His shriek etches itself into my memory as he collapses, and I wrench
Aura’s flight jacket from her hands and throw it over him, hoping to put
out the fire. The scent of charred flesh turns my stomach, but it’s
quickly overpowered by thick, cloying smoke coming from the building
behind him.</p>
<p>Xaden gets to me first, yanking me back from the captain, and shadows
stream from our feet to smother the flames as the screams cease, but the
fire in the building ahead of us roars. “Fuck.”</p>
<p>All three of us look up as the wind gusts.</p>
<p>My heart drops to the ground as house after house catches fire,
spreading down the street. The land, the buildings, the very wood
they’re built with may be drained of magic, but they go up like
kindling.</p>
<p>“Riorson!” Mira shouts, barreling out of the house behind us, Henson
close on her heels. “Do it! We’re as good as dead already!”</p>
<p>I wrench out of Xaden’s arms and stumble toward Grady as shadows rush
up the sides of the buildings, but the flames have already licked their
way across the bridges. We’re in the middle of a fucking tinderbox.</p>
<p>“Sir!” I drop in front of Grady, but he doesn’t move.</p>
<p>“He’s dead,” Xaden announces like it’s the weather forecast. “And I
can’t…”</p>
<p>I look over my shoulder to see sweat beading on his skin as he shakes
his head, lifting his hand again and again, directing shadows over one
building and then the next, but there’s no earthly way to keep up with
what the wind is spreading. Every cinder, every gust sends another
structure up in flames.</p>
<p>Captain Henson battles what she can, but even the best wind wielder
can’t control the drift of ash and ember.</p>
<p>The sky cracks, and my eyes jerk upward. The bridge connecting both
halves of the house comes crashing down, engulfed in flames. I move to
push Xaden out of the way, but Mira’s standing between us, her arms
raised and fingers splayed.</p>
<p>A pulse of blue emits like a mage light, and the bridge cracks
overhead, splitting in two and falling on either side of us.</p>
<p>“We have to get out of here.” Mira hauls me to my feet, then yanks a
stunned Aura up by her collar. The senior wingleader just stares
wide-eyed at the spreading destruction.</p>
<p>“I can do it!” Xaden shouts, raising shadow after shadow.</p>
<p>“Let it go,” Henson orders. “The best we can hope for is a clear path
to the village square for evac.”</p>
<p>Xaden’s arms tremble, and fear stabs deep within my chest, chilling
me to the bone. If the land he stands on hadn’t already been
drained…</p>
<p>I put myself in his face, uncaring that everyone can see, and grasp
his cheeks in my hands. “Let it go,” I beg. “Xaden, you have to let it
go. We need to get out of here.”</p>
<p>His tortured eyes lower to mine, reflecting the flames in their onyx
depths.</p>
<p>“Please.” I keep my gaze on his. “There’s no stopping this. There’s
only surviving it.”</p>
<p>He nods and lowers his hands.</p>
<p>Relief fills my next breath, but that’s all the time we’re
allowed.</p>
<p>“Run!” Mira shoves at us both, and we break into a sprint down the
narrow street.</p>
<p>Pain shoots from my ankles up to my knees, but it doesn’t matter, not
when both sides of the street are catching fire slightly slower than
we’re running.</p>
<p>“Focus and get to the town square,” Tairn orders, and I do just
that—focus.</p>
<p>Dragons can’t fit down these streets. We have to make it to the
square or we’re dead.</p>
<p>Every ounce of my energy goes into the placement of my feet so I
don’t roll my ankles on the stone, the movement of my breath, the space
between us as Xaden keeps pace beside me.</p>
<p>Mira hurries ahead, turning corner after corner with a certainty I
could never possess in this maze of a village, and we follow, running
for our very lives.</p>
<p>“There!” Mira shouts, pointing as the clock tower comes into view at
the end of the street and wings beat overhead. “No!” she yells. “Tairn
first!”</p>
<p>I shake my head and run faster. “Go! If Teine is here, then go!”</p>
<p>“I’m not leaving—” she starts to argue.</p>
<p>“Go so we can!” Henson yells.</p>
<p>Xaden throws his arm out, catching me in a skid as Mira races into
the courtyard to meet Teine’s arrival. Their run-on mounting is
flawless, timed to the peak of perfection, and Mira is already climbing
the clubtail’s foreleg as Teine flies over the village.</p>
<p>Henson nods as if talking to her dragon, then looks back at Aura.
“You’re next. One minute out.”</p>
<p>The flames start catching the houses behind us.</p>
<p>“This is my fault.” Aura clenches her fist to my right and looks to
the courtyard with wide, frightened eyes. “Grady is…gone. They’ll know
we’re here. There’s no hiding a fire like this.”</p>
<p>“All that matters is that we get out,” I tell her. “Don’t think about
anything else.”</p>
<p>“Overhead!” Xaden shouts as wings block the moon.</p>
<p>“We’re not the only wings in the sky,” Tairn warns, and ice prickles
the back of my neck.</p>
<p>“Go!” Henson orders Aura, pointing toward the courtyard. “Dagolh is
on the approach.”</p>
<p>“Wait!” I shout, but she’s already sprinting toward the clock tower.
“Tairn says we aren’t alone.”</p>
<p>“She’ll make it,” Henson says in a voice that doesn’t quite convince
me.</p>
<p>Scorching heat flares at my back, but I keep my eyes forward as Aura
races into the open.</p>
<p>A claw reaches for her, and I hold my breath for them to make
contact. The claw curls in the same way Tairn’s does right before he
scoops me up—</p>
<p>The talon emerges somewhere near the middle of her spine.</p>
<p>Blood gushes from the wound, but Aura’s scream is silenced as the
wyvern drags her lifeless body into the sky. Not too far overhead, a
dragon bellows.</p>
<p>Xaden’s arm tightens around me, supporting my weight when my knees
try to buckle.</p>
<p>“Tairn…”</p>
<p>“Sixty seconds,” he says, urgency lacing his tone.</p>
<p>“Damn, they got here fast,” Henson mutters, rocking back on her
heels. “All right, Riorson, you’re up—”</p>
<p>They got here fast? That’s all she has to say?</p>
<p>“We do not answer to you,” he says without taking his eyes off the
courtyard.</p>
<p>The moon catches on a flash of navy-blue wings, but instead of
landing, Sgaeyl streaks overhead, flying fast and hard for the wyvern
that’s just picking up altitude.</p>
<p>“What in Dunne’s name…”</p>
<p>“And she damn well doesn’t take your orders,” Xaden says to
Henson.</p>
<p>Sgaeyl lunges, then seems to rake her claws into the wyvern and climb
its back. Her head darts left, then right, and the creature’s wings snap
free.</p>
<p>“Remind me to never piss her off,” I mutter as the wyvern falls,
crashing somewhere at the edge of the village.</p>
<p>A corner of Xaden’s mouth rises.</p>
<p>“Approaching,” Tairn announces.</p>
<p>“Take us both.” I grab Xaden’s hand. “Run with me.”</p>
<p>Xaden’s brow furrows for a heartbeat, and then he nods.</p>
<p>“I am not a horse,” Tairn fires back as Xaden and I run for the
courtyard, the heat at our back flaring to unbearable temperatures.</p>
<p>“They patrol in pairs,” I shout down the pathway that connects all
four of us. “Take. Us. Both!” My boots pound against the stone, and
ahead, I see Sgaeyl banking back in a steep turn.</p>
<p>We hit the open air, and I block out the very real possibility that
the wyvern’s partner will see us first, sprinting harder for the widest
place where Tairn can grab us.</p>
<p>“I’m here,” he says down our shared pathway.</p>
<p>“Trust me,” Xaden demands, and I can’t tell which one of us he’s
talking to, but I instantly nod. He pivots with alarming speed, putting
himself in front of me, then hauls me up against his chest, bringing our
heads level. “Hold on.”</p>
<p>I throw my arms around his neck, the conduit bouncing against his
back as he pitches his arms outward, and bands of midnight-black shadow
wrap around us both, binding me to him.</p>
<p>Familiar wingbeats sound over the flames in the scant heartbeats
before we’re plucked off the ground, Tairn’s claws hooking over Xaden’s
shoulders and yanking us into the night.</p>
<p>Wind tears at my eyes as we fly toward Sgaeyl, but another pair of
wings approaches from the right on an intercept path. Two legs, not
four.</p>
<p>“On your right,” I warn Tairn, then turn to Xaden. “You’d better be
damn good with these shadows.”</p>
<p>“I have you,” Xaden promises, and the bands tighten.</p>
<p>Power floods my body as I throw open the Archives door, and heat
stings my skin. Gods, if I channel too much while attached to him…</p>
<p>“He’s been a great deal closer when you’ve wielded,” Tairn reminds
me, and—</p>
<p>Nope, not thinking about how he knows that.</p>
<p>I fumble for a second to clasp the conduit and hold it away from
Xaden’s skin, then let the energy surge to a breaking point and focus
entirely on my right hand.</p>
<p>Power snaps, whipping through me and departing all in the same
heartbeat. Lightning strikes and I yank it downward from the sky with my
finger, taking aim. Heat singes my fingertip, but I hold the bolt as
long as tolerable, then set it free.</p>
<p>Straight into the wyvern’s back.</p>
<p>The creature plummets and Sgaeyl roars, blasting its corpse with a
stream of fire as it falls past her. She pitches back to follow as Tairn
banks left, taking us from the path that leads along the river and
heading due west.</p>
<p>We fly like that for another few minutes, just long enough to be sure
we’re safe, then land to take our respective seats and launch again.</p>
<p>Tairn leads us low, through the shadows of the mountains and up the
ridgelines. Two and a half hours later, we cross the wards a hundred
miles south of Samara.</p>
<p>We make it back to the fortress with three hours left to spare of our
twelve-hour limit.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you let him die,” Lieutenant Pugh mutters as we walk
under the portcullis at Samara.</p>
<p>Xaden turns on him and pins him to the wall with the weight of his
forearm. “Beinhaven was a scared cadet who thought he was venin. What
the fuck is your excuse? Where were you when that wyvern skewered
her?”</p>
<p>“We were patrolling north.” The man’s complexion favors a tomato as
he forces out the words, but neither Mira nor I intercede.</p>
<p>“You were needed above the village.” Xaden removes his arm, and the
lieutenant slides down the wall.</p>
<p>Henson and Foley help Pugh stand, then walk away from us into the
courtyard, and Mira holds up her hand once their backs are to us, so we
stay right where we’re at.</p>
<p>“I got there first,” she says, turning to face us and dragging a long
chain from the inner pocket of her flight jacket.</p>
<p>A thumb-size stone I’m guessing was once the color of a citrine now
rests in its setting, cracked, hazy, and smoke-hued.</p>
<p>“Shit.” My shoulders dip. “If Courtlyn doesn’t accept that, this all
will have been for nothing.”</p>
<p>“That’s not why I’m glad I got there first.” Mira hands me the
necklace, then reaches into her pocket again, drawing out a folded piece
of parchment. “This is.”</p>
<p>Clutching the necklace in one hand, I take the parchment in the
other, noting that it’s addressed to Lightning Wielder.</p>
<p>“It was sitting next to the necklace,” Mira says as I open it, and
Xaden tenses at my side.</p>
<p>Violet,</p>
<p>Just a reminder that while I want you to come of your own free will,
I’m capable of taking you whenever I wish. Why do you not ask me for the
answers you so desperately seek?</p>
<p>—T</p>
<p>“Theophanie.” My stomach hollows.</p>
<p>Either she knows I’m looking for Andarna’s kind…</p>
<p>Or she knows I’m looking for a cure.</p>
<p>Xaden stiffens to the point of statuary. “She knew we’d be
there.”</p>
<p>Well shit, there’s that, too.</p>
<p>Perhaps the point of this is not to deny rebellion,</p>
<p>but to only go to war with those you trust implicitly.</p>
