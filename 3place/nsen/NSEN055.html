<h4 id="chapter-fifty-three">Chapter Fifty-Three</h4>
<p>If the irids fired the wardstone as the seventh breed, then Aretia is
safe. Most of Tyrrendor is.</p>
<p>It’s too surreal, too easy. Emotions beyond names hit me from every
side, but fear replaces them all when Feirge swings her body to confront
the irid, lowering her head and baring her teeth.</p>
<p>“No!” Andarna bounds from Tairn’s side, leaping over the wyvern to
put herself in front of Feirge. “He’s of my line!”</p>
<p>The Green Daggertail retreats a single step but leaves her head near
the ground as Rhiannon dismounts, jumping straight to the platform of
the temple.</p>
<p>Xaden tenses at the sight of the irid, even though there’s no sign of
red in his eyes. “You handle that, and I will see what needs to be
done…here.”</p>
<p>Considering what happened the last time he met with an irid, I
nod.</p>
<p>“Give him my gratitude,” Xaden says quietly as Rhi races our way.</p>
<p>“I will,” I promise, locking eyes with Rhi.</p>
<p>She bobs her head in acknowledgment, and then we walk down the
stairs.</p>
<p>“No weapons,” I tell Rhi as we walk between Tairn and Sgaeyl.
“They’re pacifists.”</p>
<p>“Got it,” she notes, keeping pace at my side. “So he shouldn’t burn
us to death, right? I refuse to tell Feirge that she was right. She’ll
never let me live it down, even if I’m dead. And I really want to know
what just happened with those dark wielders.”</p>
<p>“I’ll fill you in,” I reply as we approach Leothan and Andarna. “Just
be prepared for—”</p>
<p>Rhi gasps and covers her ears.</p>
<p>“That,” I finish with a wince.</p>
<p>Leothan glances at Rhi, then turns his back to the corpse of the
wyvern with a look of what can only be called disdain.</p>
<p>Andarna moves to my left when we reach them, flooding the bond with a
mix of apprehension and excitement.</p>
<p>“I would expect a warmer greeting from a green,” Leothan lectures
Rhi, then turns his golden gaze on me.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I blurt awkwardly, craning my neck to look at him.
“You’ve saved everyone in this province.”</p>
<p>“I did not do it for you,” he says, peering down at Andarna.</p>
<p>“Harsh,” Rhi whispers.</p>
<p>“I give my thanks,” Andarna replies, her head high.</p>
<p>“Your human is as dangerous as we feared.” He studies her with a
tilted head, and my stomach sinks. Whatever he’s seen has only confirmed
the reasons they denied Andarna in the first place.</p>
<p>“She defends her people,” Andarna retorts, her claws flexing in the
rain-soaked grass. At least the weather has eased to a drizzle. “And
ours.”</p>
<p>“As do you.” Leothan’s voice softens. “I have been watching you since
my arrival.”</p>
<p>And no one knew. Tairn bristles, and my throat grows tight.</p>
<p>“And what have you seen?” Andarna’s tail flicks overhead. “What
judgment have you passed?”</p>
<p>Her caustic tone certainly isn’t going to help, and neither is the
growl rumbling in Sgaeyl’s throat.</p>
<p>The irid narrows his eyes. “Your behavior is abhorrent and your
actions misguided—”</p>
<p>“She is a credit to our riot,” Sgaeyl hisses.</p>
<p>“As we hoped she would be.” He swivels his head toward Sgaeyl, and
Tairn angles into a striking position. “Yet in none of the ways we
value.”</p>
<p>Rhi steps closer to my side.</p>
<p>“None of which is her fault,” I interject, and he looks my way. “You
set her up for what you consider failure when you left her here to be
raised in the ways of the Empyrean.”</p>
<p>“You really want to yell at the massive unknown dragon?” Rhi
whispers.</p>
<p>“I do,” I answer, looking straight at him. “There is nothing wrong
with her. We can never thank you enough for what you’ve done tonight in
firing our wards, but if you’ve only come to point out all the ways you
believe her to be lacking, you’ll find Feirge’s greeting warmer than
mine.”</p>
<p>He tilts his head, then dismisses me, swinging his gaze to Andarna.
“Your motives are honorable,” he says. “That was what I was going to say
before I was interrupted by the blue.”</p>
<p>“Sgaeyl,” Andarna corrects him, her tone a knife’s edge softer than
before.</p>
<p>“Sgaeyl,” he repeats, then focuses on Andarna. “We are separated by
many generations but share the same bloodline. Unlike the others you
encountered who are of a more distant line, we are of the same den, or
would have been had you been raised among us.”</p>
<p>He’s her family. My heart clenches.</p>
<p>“Your human may stay,” he replies to Andarna. “The rest may not
participate in our conversation.”</p>
<p>My eyebrows rise.</p>
<p>“I will not leave them unprotected.” Tairn’s claws flex next to
Rhi.</p>
<p>“The fact you think they need protection is why my words are only for
them.” Leothan keeps his focus on Andarna. “I will only offer once.”</p>
<p>Andarna tenses, then whips her head toward Tairn and Sgaeyl. “I must
hear him.”</p>
<p>Sgaeyl startles, and Rhi’s hands jump to cover her ears.</p>
<p>Tairn snarls, and I reach down the bond, but there’s a stronger
shield than his blocking us. Leothan.</p>
<p>It’s oddly similar to the effects of the serum they dosed us with
during RSC. Every part of me rebels at the disconnect, but I owe it to
Andarna to stay with her.</p>
<p>“We will begin once they depart,” Leothan promises.</p>
<p>“He’s cut us off from you,” I say to Rhi, then look up at Tairn.
“I’ll be all right.”</p>
<p>Sgaeyl bares her teeth, then pivots abruptly and turns toward the
temple, toward Xaden.</p>
<p>“You’re sure?” Rhi asks, worry knitting her brow.</p>
<p>“I’m sure.” I swallow the growing boulder in my throat. “I won’t be
the reason she can’t hear him out.”</p>
<p>Rhi looks like she’s going to argue for a second, then nods. “We
won’t be far.” She follows Sgaeyl, and Tairn growls in warning at
Leothan before pivoting.</p>
<p>Andarna’s tail curves over my head.</p>
<p>“It did not sit well with me that you were judged by the shortcomings
of others,” Leothan states, dipping his head to Andarna’s eye level.
“Even the dark wielder you seem…fond of.”</p>
<p>Hope flickers in my chest, burning away the expected insults, and
Andarna’s scales ripple in shades of black.</p>
<p>“You should be given the chance to learn our ways,” he continues. “To
choose our ways.”</p>
<p>“You will stay and teach me?” she asks.</p>
<p>“You will come home with me,” he answers, holding her gaze. “It may
take a few years, but the others will accept my decision. By then you
will have learned enough to know your truth.”</p>
<p>Years? My stomach launches straight into my throat.</p>
<p>“We cannot leave for years.” Sorrow drenches Andarna’s words.</p>
<p>“You can,” he rebuts.</p>
<p>“By myself?” She freezes.</p>
<p>Oh gods. My spine stiffens, and a terror I’ve never encountered
before locks my muscles. He means to separate us.</p>
<p>“I have saved the human you care for by firing the protections in
place,” he states, like he’s checking off boxes that might impede her
departure. “She will be safe from all but her own kind under the wing of
your mentor.”</p>
<p>“I cannot leave her!” Andarna’s head draws back.</p>
<p>My heart thunders a dangerously quick beat.</p>
<p>“You must. This was not meant for you, nor any of our line. Look at
what happened tonight. Had I not interfered, you would no longer exist.”
His scales flicker, taking on a pearlescent sheen. “There is nothing
here for you but war and suffering.”</p>
<p>And me. And Tairn. And Sgaeyl. It takes all my self-control not to
scream it, not to ruin this moment for Andarna.</p>
<p>“I am bonded.” Andarna’s tail lowers, curving around me. “Our lives,
our minds, the very energy that forms us is intertwined.”</p>
<p>Right. That. Exactly. I find myself nodding.</p>
<p>“So end it.” He angles his head, and the scales above his eyes furrow
into a single line. “Bonds are merely magical ties. You are irid. You
are magic. Bend it, shape it, break it as you see fit.”</p>
<p>Wait. What?</p>
<p>“I cannot.” Andarna’s tail winds closer.</p>
<p>Air becomes scarce, and my head starts to swim.</p>
<p>“And yet you already did.” He glances down at me. “Who bonded you
first?”</p>
<p>This can’t be real. Maybe I’m dreaming. Or in Xaden’s dream. Though
we’ve definitely stumbled into nightmare territory. “They chose me the
same day.”</p>
<p>He sighs in annoyance, and steam gusts over me. “Who spoke to you
first?”</p>
<p>My eyes shift, and I throw my thoughts back to Threshing.</p>
<p>Step aside, Silver One. Tairn’s voice rumbles through my memory.</p>
<p>“Tairn,” I whisper, turning my face toward Andarna. I take in
everything about her, from the pattern of her scales, the slope of her
nose, the angle of her eyes, up to the swirls on her horns that match
his. “You didn’t speak to me until you gave me your name on the flight
field.”</p>
<p>She blinks.</p>
<p>“See?” Leothan shifts his focus to Andarna. “Humans should only be
capable of bonding a single dragon, and yet you forged a second
connection where there shouldn’t be one. Only an irid can do that. Your
instincts are excellent, but you need instruction. Break the connection
and come with me.”</p>
<p>My heart thunders like hoofbeats in my ears.</p>
<p>“But Violet…” Andarna’s tone shifts from denial to… Amari help me, is
that worry?</p>
<p>I blanch as it hits me. She wants to go. Of course she does. He’s her
family—the only dragon of her kind willing to accept her. I’m the one
holding her back.</p>
<p>“Her other bond will sustain her life,” Leothan states like that’s
all there is between Andarna and me. “Should you choose to return, you
can always reforge the bond.”</p>
<p>When she doesn’t respond, he lowers his head to my eye level. “She is
emotionally ensnared because of her age. What would you have her
do?”</p>
<p>Andarna ducks her head.</p>
<p>“I…” Warmth drains from my face, but I keep my eyes on her,
memorizing every detail like it might be the last time I see her. The
possibility is unfathomable—I developed my signet out of sheer need for
her—and yet it feels like we’re hurtling toward some kind of precipice.
“I love you and I want you to feel complete,” I tell her, and she slowly
meets my gaze. “I want you happy and safe and thriving. I want you to
live.” My voice breaks. “Even if it’s not with me.”</p>
<p>“Admirable,” Leothan says. “I understand your choice.”</p>
<p>Yearning floods the bond, so deep it aches within my own chest, and
the pain of it sucks the breath from my lungs. I force my head to nod,
feeling everything she can’t say.</p>
<p>“I do not know how—” she starts.</p>
<p>A shrieking whistle sounds in my head, and then only silence remains.
I reach for the bond and find only a wall…then nothing.</p>
<p>Andarna whips her head toward Leothan.</p>
<p>He launches without warning, springing high above me. His wings snap
open, and wind blasts my face as he gains altitude. His scales flicker,
turning the color of the cloudy night sky, and he begins to
disappear.</p>
<p>Andarna roars up at him, and then her gaze swings wildly, focusing
behind me, then to the right, then landing on me for the length of a
heartbeat. Her eyes flare like she wants to say something, and I throw
myself at the wall where our bond should be.</p>
<p>But it’s gone.</p>
<p>A breath later, so is she.</p>
<p>All that’s left is a gust of wind as her scales blend into the
sky.</p>
<p>A roar vibrates my very bones, and my ears ring as the edges of my
vision darken. My heart stutters, and my lungs cease their struggle.
There’s no air and no reason to seek it. I was infinite yet moored, and
now I’m hollow and adrift in waters too vast to comprehend.</p>
<p>My knees buckle, then collide with the ground.</p>
<p>“Violet!” someone shouts, and racing bootsteps register a second
before she crouches in front of me, her brown eyes searching mine for
answers I don’t have. “Are you all right?”</p>
<p>I’m nothing.</p>
<p>The sky darkens, and the ground trembles. I look up into the black
void, and my vision narrows in an ever-shrinking circle. Not the sky. A
wing.</p>
<p>Stern, demanding golden eyes appear.</p>
<p>“You will breathe!” His deep, gravelly voice fills my head, and
unyielding strength barrels down the pathway that connects us.</p>
<p>Tairn.</p>
<p>He exists, therefore I must, because we are bound. Never alone.
Always connected.</p>
<p>I gasp and air rushes in. My heart pounds in an erratic, painful
beat, but the edges of my vision clear. “She left us. She left us. She
left us.” It’s all I can think.</p>
<p>“We remain,” Tairn orders, as if I have a choice not to.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Someone hits his knees beside me, and my gaze
swings, meeting amber-flecked onyx. Not someone—Xaden. “Violet?” Worry
and fear slide down the bond that tethers us, and the connection anchors
my heartbeat.</p>
<p>I exist for Tairn, but I live for Xaden.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Rhiannon answers, and I find her watching me with
heartrending worry that I instantly want to soothe.</p>
<p>Rhi’s still here. So are Mira, and Brennan, and Ridoc, and Sawyer,
and Dain, and Jesinia, and Imogen, and Aaric…everyone is here but
her.</p>
<p>“How could she do this?” Sgaeyl snaps, fury sharpening the words to
daggers.</p>
<p>“She’s gone,” I whisper to Rhi, then crumple under the weight of the
unbearable truth. Xaden catches me, tugging my shoulder against his
chest, and his brow furrows as our gazes collide. “Andarna’s gone.”</p>
<p>No rider has ever survived the loss of their dragon.</p>
<p>I can’t imagine wanting to.</p>
