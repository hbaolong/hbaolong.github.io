<h4 id="chapter-four">Chapter Four</h4>
<p>I shake my head at the two subtle marks.</p>
<p>“That’s nothing. It’s barely there.” And his eyes look exactly the
same from this distance. Whatever he did wasn’t even close to what had
happened during the battle.</p>
<p>“Because I stopped.” He climbs off the far side of the bed and
retreats until the backs of his thighs hit my desk. “The second your
power rose, I felt it and remembered why I’d promised myself I wasn’t
going to touch you. And I thought, if I could at least take care of you,
that would be enough for me, but then I was so fucking close…” He
white-knuckles the edge of my desk and brings his gaze to mine. “I can’t
afford to lose control around you. Not even the edge of it.” He glances
toward the headboard. “Not like that. Not at all.”</p>
<p>My chest aches, and I breathe deeply to slow my racing heart. If he
truly channeled… “Can I come over there? I won’t touch you.”</p>
<p>He nods. “I’m all right now. Firmly under control.”</p>
<p>I cross the cold floor in my bare feet and put myself directly in
front of him, sighing with relief when I don’t find a trace of red in
his eyes. “No red.”</p>
<p>His shoulders dip. “Good. I locked it down pretty quick and didn’t
even feel myself taking anything, but I obviously did.”</p>
<p>“Sandpaper takes more than you did.” I look back at the headboard
just to be sure I wasn’t imagining things. “I can barely see it, and
only because I’m looking.”</p>
<p>“I took it without thinking. Without choice. And if it had been you?”
He tucks my hair behind my ear. “I would never have forgiven myself.” He
heaves a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>The ache in my chest only sharpens. “Are you going to go all broody
and try to pull away from me? Because fair warning, I’m not going to let
that happen.”</p>
<p>“No.” The corners of his mouth rise. “I just think we’ve been right
to steer clear of activities where I can’t be trusted to keep control.
It’s the only way you’re safe, and as much as I want you to run, I’m too
selfish to give you up.”</p>
<p>I nod slowly, since it’s not like I’m going to argue with what’s
obviously his line.</p>
<p>“And just so you know, that memory of yours was really fucking hot. I
loved every second of it.” He swallows and grips both sides of the desk
again, like he already regrets his decision.</p>
<p>My brow knits. “I’m not quite sure how I even did it. Is the thought
sharing an inntinnsic thing? Or a bond thing? It’s happened more than
once with us.”</p>
<p>A corner of his mouth rises, and his grip relaxes. “No fucking clue.
I’ve never tried it with anyone else.” His smirk shifts to a full smile,
and I breathe a little easier. “The first time, I was sitting in tactics
and couldn’t get you out of my damned head. Then you reached out,
struggling to wield when you’d all but set the whole campus on fire the
night before, and I just let the memory play, partly to help you, but
mostly so you’d be in the same hell I was in.” There’s zero guilt in the
admission. “Now let’s get dressed. We probably slept through
breakfast.”</p>
<p>We get ready in relative normalcy considering what just happened. I
wrap my knee quickly, going above and below my kneecap to hold it in
place, then finish dressing. By the time I slip my armor on over my
undershirt, Xaden is there, lacing it on just as efficiently as when he
takes it off, though one takes considerably longer than the other. “You
were out late last night,” I say as he works his way to the tie.
“Anything to do with Duke Lindell being here?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” He tugs gently, and my shoulders straighten.</p>
<p>“Makes me glad you’re sleeping here,” I note, and his fingers still.
“All three of the highest Houses of Tyrrendor are here, two of whom are
known to hold allegiance only to the province, and the third is
suspected.” I glance over my shoulder at him. “Was it not Lindell who
made sure you and Liam were trained to enter the quadrant?”</p>
<p>Xaden nods. “It was, though Lewellen had a hand in it, too.”</p>
<p>My brows rise. “I’m sure it’s crossed Melgren’s mind that he could
wipe the slate clean. There’s a lot of chaos in these halls and almost
no one of rank to notice.” Be careful. I say those two words with my
eyes.</p>
<p>He nods again, then goes back to situating the corset, and I face
forward. “Killing me isn’t required to annihilate the Tyrrish
aristocracy. Officially, I’m just a lieutenant who has no place in any
of the negotiations, and yet I’m supposed to speak for Aretia, according
to your brother. All done.” He ties the corset strings, then shocks the
shit out of me by placing a kiss beneath my ear before he walks to the
weapons rack by the door.</p>
<p>“Thanks. Do you want to?” I ask, tugging my uniform top on and
buttoning it.</p>
<p>“Sit in on the negotiations?” he asks, shrugging on his back
sheaths.</p>
<p>“Speak for Aretia. All of it.” I cross the room, starting to braid my
hair into its usual coronet on my way to the desk, and he looks at me
with an expression I can’t read. “You said you were happy with the way
things were running, but I don’t know if anyone ever…asked you.”</p>
<p>His brow furrows. “The Assembly runs Aretia. I just own the house,
which is probably a good thing, since I’m…well, venin. Great on the
battlefield, but not a good governing quality.”</p>
<p>I lock every muscle to keep from flinching, then continue
braiding.</p>
<p>“Anyway, we’re trying to work out the terms of the riot staying, and
Lewellen seems to think he can at least get my father’s sword back from
Tauri, but it all feels tangled. If we don’t stay, Poromiel walks. If
Navarre can’t protect the fliers here at Basgiath, Poromiel walks. If
anyone murders anyone—which happens a lot around here—”</p>
<p>“Poromiel walks,” I guess, reaching for the pins on my desk to secure
the braid in place, and most definitely noticing that he used the term
we. It’s on the tip of my tongue to tell him I’ll be actively working on
one of those things in the next forty-eight hours, but he doesn’t want
to know, and losing control a few minutes ago isn’t going to help that
stance.</p>
<p>“Exactly, and two of the third-year fliers had a run-in with First
Wing last night near the great hall that left everyone bloody.” He
starts sheathing his daggers along his thighs. “If Tauri isn’t willing
to take civilians, then Poromiel has nothing to gain by promising not to
attack our outposts. The only incentives are weapons and keeping the
fliers safe.”</p>
<p>“Both of which can be achieved by an alliance with only Aretia,” I
note as Xaden begins putting my daggers in place, slipping them into the
sheaths at my thighs and the ones sewn into my uniform along my
ribs.</p>
<p>“Now who sounds like the separatist?” His mouth quirks. “If we had
stable wards, maybe. But we know they’re faltering, and even if they
weren’t, the last time Tyrrendor attempted to secede, it didn’t go—” He
cocks his head to the side like he’s listening, then storms toward the
door, whipping it open. “Are you fucking kidding me? Neither of us has
even used a bathing chamber yet.”</p>
<p>Ah, there’s the hard-ass everyone else gets. I don’t fight the urge
to smile. There’s a huge part of me that likes that I’m the only one who
gets his softer edges. “Who is it?” I ask, grabbing my flight jacket off
the back of the chair.</p>
<p>“You’re in there with my little sister and you’re asking me if I’m
kidding you?” Brennan snaps back. “Usually, I consider myself pretty
understanding about the fact that you sleep in her bed, and I look the
other way when you two attach yourselves at the face, but we have a
meeting in thirty minutes and I need to talk to you before then.”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Brennan,” I call out, slipping my arms into my flight
jacket.</p>
<p>“Hey, Violet,” he answers.</p>
<p>“I have a patrol,” Xaden says.</p>
<p>“He does,” Garrick adds from somewhere behind Brennan.</p>
<p>“How many people are out here?” I duck under Xaden’s arm, and my
brows rise. The hallway is packed. Brennan, Garrick, Lewellen, Bodhi,
and Imogen are all waiting. The days of negotiation have worn on both
Lewellen and Brennan, darkening the circles under Brennan’s eyes and
thickening the salt-and-pepper stubble on Lewellen’s strong jaw, as
though he’s been too tired or too busy to shave. “Did someone die? Why
didn’t any of you knock?”</p>
<p>“Because she’s mean.” Garrick nods toward Imogen, who’s leaned up
against the wall to my right.</p>
<p>“She needs to fucking sleep.” She cocks her head to the side at him.
“Given how rested you look, I’m guessing you got plenty of that in Nina
Shrensour’s bed last night. How disappointing for her.”</p>
<p>“Damn.” Bodhi fights to smother a laugh.</p>
<p>A slow smile spreads across Garrick’s face, and a dimple pops in his
left cheek. “Careful, Imogen. You sound a little jealous.”</p>
<p>“Who the hell would be jealous of a flier?” Her pointed glare
promises a quick death.</p>
<p>“Right.” Brennan rubs the bridge of his nose, and Lewellen walks
away, shaking his head. “Look, we just need Riorson.”</p>
<p>“Seriously, figure your shit out, kids. We’re in the middle of a
war,” Mira says from the end of the short hallway, her cheeks red and
goggle lines still fresh in her skin.</p>
<p>I instantly grin. “You made it!” Thank you, Amari, we have
forty-eight hours and a shot.</p>
<p>“I thought you were due back tonight at the earliest.” Brennan raises
his reddish eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Teine was feeling spry.” Mira’s smile could cut glass, but at least
she’s trying. It took her months to let him back in after she found him
alive. Who knows how long she’ll need to get over losing our mother on
what she considers to be Brennan’s watch. “I bring news and a few
missives.”</p>
<p>I need everyone to leave now so I can know exactly what that news
is.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Brennan says to Mira, then turns to Xaden. “This is more
important than patrol.”</p>
<p>Xaden’s hand skims my lower back as he walks into the hall, then
follows Brennan to the main hallway, where Lewellen waits, Garrick close
on his heels.</p>
<p>“Anything I should know about?” Bodhi asks, two lines appearing
between his brows as Mira slings her pack from her shoulder.</p>
<p>“We’re good,” Brennan assures him as the foursome turns the corner
and disappears.</p>
<p>“Good to feel needed,” Bodhi mutters, stepping closer as Mira
completes our own huddle. “Guess we’ll be taking the patrol,
Imogen.”</p>
<p>“Did you figure it out?” I ask Mira, unable to take another
second.</p>
<p>“First, Felix sent a gift.” She retrieves a conduit from her bag and
hands it to me with a smile.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank the gods.” I sigh with relief as my fingers curl around
the metal-rimmed glass orb that gives me a semblance of control over my
signet.</p>
<p>“And then there’s this.” That little spark of hope behind my ribs
fans straight into a flame when Mira pulls a wooden, runed practice disk
from her satchel. “Trissa’s a genius.”</p>
<p>My jaw drops. There are three runes tempered into the disk, one for
levitation in the middle, then two in overlapping layers for what appear
to be sound-shielding and warmth. The outermost line—warmth—is broken by
a small green shoot of new growth. “How did you do it?” It’s almost
impossible to keep my tone down.</p>
<p>“After being nearly blown up and hurled like a projectile”—a smile
lifts the corners of her mouth—“we altered the material the rune is
tempered into without destroying it, truly changing its form. Turns out
Kylynn is an agrarian,” Mira says.</p>
<p>“Battle-Ax is a plant wielder?” I whisper.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to whisper, Vi.” Mira grins. “The sound shield is
still active even though we nullified the warmth rune. It should cover
us to almost the edge of the hall.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” I ask.</p>
<p>“I’m sure. It’s cool to the touch, and…” Mira places a gold coin over
the center of the levitation rune, and it floats. Nullifying a rune is
mind-blowing. Figuring out how to do it without affecting the others?
Incredible. “We’ve got it. It’s not without risk, but we can do it.”</p>
<p>My heart starts to pound. “We can save the negotiations.” The fliers
will stay, and I can keep my deal with Tecarus.</p>
<p>“If they agree,” Imogen says slowly, “which you know they won’t.”</p>
<p>“Incoming,” Bodhi announces, tilting his chin toward the hallway.
Brennan slowly makes his way toward us, his gaze focused on the floor
like he’s deep in thought. “We’re heading out.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell the others yet,” Mira rushes, shoving the disk in her
pack at her feet. “We have to give the Senarium a chance to do the right
thing, and the fewer people who know, the fewer people who are executed
for treason.”</p>
<p>Bodhi and Imogen both nod, and I blink as they start walking away.
“Hey, what did you need? Why were you waiting?” I ask Imogen.</p>
<p>Bodhi crams his hands in his pockets and continues walking, and
Imogen glances sideways at Brennan as they pass. “Just wanted to make
sure you were…getting some sleep,” she calls back as they turn the
corner and disappear.</p>
<p>Bodhi. Garrick. Imogen. My stomach tightens. They were checking to
make sure Xaden hadn’t killed me.</p>
<p>“You look like shit,” Mira says as Brennan reaches us.</p>
<p>“I feel like shit.” He rubs a hand over his face. “Poromish politics
are nothing like ours. I only have a few minutes before I need to get
back in there and beg Cygnisen to stay at the table. Neither side speaks
the language of middle ground.”</p>
<p>“I would think not wanting to be killed by venin would encourage them
to learn quickly,” Mira states, tilting her head just like our mother,
which tightens my throat.</p>
<p>“You would think.” He shakes his head. “The only thing everyone can
agree on is that the fliers will be allowed to tour the quadrant today
with their squads’ first-year riders—apparently they’re not as
threatening—and the task force going with you,” he says to me.</p>
<p>“Where exactly is she going?” Mira snaps, moving to my side.</p>
<p>“We’re being sent to find the rest of Andarna’s kind,” I answer for
Brennan.</p>
<p>“You what?” Her eyes widen to impossible proportions.</p>
<p>“Andarna wants to. I should have told you before you left, but the
Empyrean hadn’t approved it yet.” Guilt thickens my throat at her
stricken expression. “She was always going to go. At least Andarna was
able to make some demands this way.”</p>
<p>“You let this happen?” She glares at Brennan.</p>
<p>“Mira—” I start.</p>
<p>“Quiet, cadet, the officers are speaking,” she snaps.</p>
<p>Rude.</p>
<p>“Beyond our needs, Queen Maraya hopes the seventh breed might know
how to defeat the venin, given the age of Andarna’s egg.” He’s not far
off from our own train of thought. “Mira, that hope is all that’s
keeping Poromiel at the table, and we’re still negotiating for flier
safety and conferencing with Navarre for the Aretian cadets to stay. You
know, behind the functioning wards. This is more complicated than it
looks.”</p>
<p>Mira bristles. “Simple question: Did you tell them over your dead
body is our sister flying through what’s likely enemy-controlled,
wyvern-filled territory on a fool’s errand?”</p>
<p>“They should worry more about what will happen when we do find them,”
Tairn growls. “If a den of our kind chose to leave—chose to hide—they
will not welcome our intrusion.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know that.” Hurt laces Andarna’s argument.</p>
<p>“You are naive to assume otherwise.” His tone sharpens, and Andarna
slams our pathways shut. “She needs to prepare herself,” he says. “And
so do you. There’s every chance this mission will kill us.”</p>
<p>Or it could save us all. Freaking pessimist.</p>
<p>“He couldn’t say no.” My grip tightens on the conduit. “Aretia needs
another of Andarna’s kind to fire their wardstone.”</p>
<p>Mira whips her face toward mine, horror widening her eyes before they
quickly narrow back on our brother. “Is that why you sent me off to
evaluate the status of the wards? So you’d know how long you have before
using our sister like a gaming chip?”</p>
<p>“That is not how it happened.” His jaw ticks. “I’m trying to support
what she wants.”</p>
<p>“It’s not happening. We have six months, Brennan!” She digs into her
pack and retrieves a bundle of missives, then shoves them at his chest,
hitting him right next to his Aisereigh name tag. “Given the rate
they’re diminishing, I calculate six months before total collapse if
we’re lucky. Finding Andarna’s kind could take decades. By the time she
finds them—if she finds them—Aretia’s gone. You’d be risking Violet’s
life for nothing.”</p>
<p>My stomach hits the floor. Six months? I figured we’d at least have a
year or two before the wards gave out. That path’s timeline just got
complicated, but I’ll be damned if Xaden loses his home twice.</p>
<p>“Six months.” Brennan’s gaze darts between Ridoc’s and Rhi’s doors as
if he’s performing calculations in his head.</p>
<p>“No. This is the kind of mission riders don’t return from.” Mira
draws back, studying our brother like he’s a stranger.</p>
<p>Well, that’s comforting.</p>
<p>“This is bigger than the three of us. Hundreds of thousands of
civilians are under attack in Poromiel.” He shoves the missives into his
chest pocket and sighs. “Of course I don’t want her in danger, and they
won’t let me go with her. I already asked.”</p>
<p>“Find another way.” Mira shakes her head. “You can’t trade Violet’s
life for strangers’.”</p>
<p>“Now you sound like Mom.” The words fly from his mouth, and to his
credit, he immediately winces when both Mira and I gasp. “Shit.” He
hangs his head.</p>
<p>“You dare mention our mother when you won’t even wear it?” She grabs
the runed disk from her pack and throws it at our brother, smacking him
square in the chest. He fumbles to catch it. “Look at what I’ve been
doing this week, Lieutenant Colonel Aisereigh. Not sure Mom would
approve.”</p>
<p>Crap. This is not the cool, calm plan we discussed presenting to our
brother.</p>
<p>His brows knit as he studies the disk. “I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“We found a way to keep the fliers at Basgiath safely,” she says.</p>
<p>He keeps looking at it, and I see the moment the truth hits him. The
blood drains from his face, and his mouth slackens. “You want to—”</p>
<p>“Yes. And you should find a mirror,” Mira interrupts, earning his
attention. “Sacrificing members of our family for what’s considered the
greater good is a weapon straight out of Mom’s arsenal.” She walks away
without another word.</p>
<p>I pat his shoulder. “Take it to the Senarium.”</p>
<p>“They’ll never agree.”</p>
<p>“You and I both know it’s the only way to forge this alliance.”</p>
<p>He nods. “That’s what I’m afraid of.”</p>
<p>Never forget that dragon riders have been selected, trained, and even
bred for cruelty. Expecting mercy from a rider is a mistake, for none
will be given.</p>
