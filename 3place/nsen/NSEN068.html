<h4 id="chapter-sixty-six">Chapter Sixty-Six</h4>
<p>VIOLET</p>
<p>“Violet!” Brennan shouts, racing down the steps of Riorson House and
into the moonlit courtyard.</p>
<p>Sounds of celebration stream through the open doors.</p>
<p>I groggily rise to my feet beside Imogen, and a shape moves in the
shadows to the right.</p>
<p>“I will not let them burn you,” Andarna vows.</p>
<p>“What?” My head whips her way. “Why would my brother burn me?” And
why in Dunne’s name would I be sitting on gravel in the courtyard? My
thoughts are…slow. Something’s off.</p>
<p>Something’s wrong.</p>
<p>“Are you all right?” I ask Brennan as he reaches us.</p>
<p>“Am I all right?” His eyes bulge, and he looks me over for injury.
“It’s three o’clock in the morning! Where have you been?” His voice
rises, and a group of riders I don’t recognize comes through the gate at
our left. “Weilsen?” Brennan asks, and the taller one walks our way.
“Report.” He glances over his shoulder. “Quietly.”</p>
<p>My mouth opens, then shuts. Where have I been?</p>
<p>“We’ve—” The officer’s gaze darts over me.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” Brennan assures him.</p>
<p>“Official numbers are four riders, their dragons, and three elders
murdered in the valley in what we’re estimating is the last few hours,”
Weilsen says. “And we still have five riders missing—four now,” he adds,
looking at me. His mouth tenses. “But after that display, we all know
Riorson did this. I bet the other three are already dead.”</p>
<p>My stomach lurches, and Imogen tenses so hard she might as well be
stone.</p>
<p>Wait. Is this a dream? I clench my right fist and prick my palm with
my fingernails just enough to feel pain, but I don’t wake.</p>
<p>“The wards are holding in Draithus as of the last report, but who
knows how many of those desiccations during the battle were actually
him,” Weilsen continues. “And so far, the tally is at six missing eggs
from the hatching ground, but they’re double-checking.”</p>
<p>Missing eggs? I reach for Tairn, but the bond feels foggy, like he’s
asleep.</p>
<p>“He needs a cycle of rest to recover,” Andarna clarifies.</p>
<p>“Recover from what?” He was fine when I saw him last, which was about
five minutes ago, in the woods at the edge of the field—</p>
<p>Where I killed Theophanie.</p>
<p>Xaden.</p>
<p>The wall of shadows… My heart sinks. What the fuck is happening? How
did I get here? Why is my head so hazy? Am I concussed?</p>
<p>“You’re dismissed,” Brennan tells the rider. “Keep this classified
until we have a full report.”</p>
<p>“Just because she’s your sister doesn’t mean she’s not the fastest
way—”</p>
<p>“Dismissed!” Brennan snaps, and the rider backs away.</p>
<p>“Do you know where he is?” Brennan asks me softly once the other
rider is fully out of earshot. “Riorson? You heard what Weilsen said. We
have dead dragons and riders and missing eggs, and if you’ve seen
Riorson, I need to know, Violet.”</p>
<p>“I…” Words fail me. Why can’t I think? “I don’t know.” I raise my
hands to my mouth, and a piece of parchment in my front pocket catches
on my arm, then falls.</p>
<p>Brennan catches it. “Cardulo?” He lifts his eyes to Imogen.</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen him since yesterday,” she says, her voice low, almost
monotone. “Lieutenant Tavis?”</p>
<p>“Among the missing,” Brennan answers gently, then glances my way and
does a double take. “Holy shit, Violet.”</p>
<p>“What?” I lower my arms. Garrick is missing, too? Who else makes up
the four riders Weilsen mentioned?</p>
<p>“Your finger,” Imogen says, then stares at the ground.</p>
<p>My finger? The snap. Right. “I think I broke my arm.” I glance down
and stare.</p>
<p>My left arm is splinted, and a beautiful gold ring with an emerald
the size of my thumbnail sits on my hand. Oh gods, I know that stone. It
matches the others from the Blade of Aretia upstairs on Xaden’s
nightstand. Is it the missing one? “What is happening right now?” I ask
slowly.</p>
<p>“You don’t know?” Brennan lowers his voice.</p>
<p>I shake my head.</p>
<p>Brennan turns to the paper from my pocket. “This carries the seal of
Dunne,” he says. “May I open it?”</p>
<p>I nod, gawking at the ring. It’s not just any ring on any finger.
It’s the finger. But how? I was in the field battling Theophanie this
afternoon, and then she desiccated and I burned myself straight into
unconsciousness. Now it’s three a.m. and I’m in Aretia, and there are
murdered dragons and riders, missing riders and missing eggs? Xaden
wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p>Would he?</p>
<p>The storm of shadows. My blood chills. How far had he gone? I fling
myself down the bond, but there’s nothing there. It’s gone.</p>
<p>Or he’s too far away to feel it, I remind myself to keep from
panicking. When had he put this ring on my hand?</p>
<p>“It’s an official blessing of your legal, binding marriage,” Brennan
whispers, stunned, then quickly rolls the parchment. “By the head
priestess of Dunne’s temple.”</p>
<p>“To Xaden?” Gravity bends, warping everything I thought I knew into
whatever this reality is.</p>
<p>Brennan nods.</p>
<p>My eyes flare. We’re married? A thousand emotions try to force their
way through my jumbled thoughts, but the immediate rush of awe trips
right over the logic of how. There’s no fucking way I’d forget something
like that. Why isn’t he here? Where did he go? And why?</p>
<p>“I think the note on the outside is meant for you.” Brennan hands
back the parchment.</p>
<p>I flip the missive over to see two sentences written in Xaden’s
handwriting.</p>
<p>Don’t look for me. It’s yours now.</p>
<p>He’s gone.</p>
<p>I try to fumble my foggy brain through the overwhelming shock, but I
can’t think straight. It’s like someone has fucked with my—</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>My chest draws tight. “How long have I been missing?”</p>
<p>“Twelve hours,” Brennan answers.</p>
<p>“What did you do?” My head snaps toward Imogen, and a deep sense of
foreboding takes root in my chest.</p>
<p>She slowly lifts her gaze to mine. “What you asked me to.”</p>
