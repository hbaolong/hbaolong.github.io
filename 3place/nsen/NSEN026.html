<h4 id="chapter-twenty-four">Chapter Twenty-Four</h4>
<p>“Books?” I whisper, my fingers curling around the dagger I realize is
still in my left hand.</p>
<p>Narelle tilts her head. “I did not stutter.” She looks pointedly at
the armchair. “Put that back in its place.”</p>
<p>Xaden lifts a brow but does as she asks, then crosses the small
section of the room and sheathes my dagger at my hip.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I whisper.</p>
<p>He brushes a kiss over my temple, then takes the empty spot at my
right side.</p>
<p>“Get off the floor, Urson—you’re bleeding everywhere. Take your
sister to the back and wake her up. Did I not say you were ill-prepared
to carry a weapon?” Narelle lectures as she avoids the spilled blood.
“Please forgive my grandchildren. They took our task of protecting the
books from any riders who aren’t…you a little too seriously.” She sinks
into the chair. “Thank you, young man,” she says to Xaden, then gives
him a second look before glancing at Dain. “My, the Continent does have
some fine-looking men.”</p>
<p>A corner of Xaden’s mouth quirks upward, and I can’t help but
silently agree with her.</p>
<p>“Mom.” The shopkeeper rushes to her side, no doubt still worried
we’ll attack her mother. Urson hurries to do Narelle’s bidding, helping
his sister off the floor as she reluctantly comes to from Mira’s last
punch. They disappear into the back, and I almost feel bad for them
until I remember that they attacked us.</p>
<p>“I’m ninety-three, Leona, I’m not dead.” She waves her daughter off.
“Or what is it you Amaralis say? I have not yet met Malek. He’s your god
of death, is he not?”</p>
<p>My brow furrows at the unknown term: Amaralis.</p>
<p>“Isn’t he everyone’s god of death?” Mira leans back against the
nearest row of bookshelves.</p>
<p>I shake my head. “Deverelli don’t worship gods.”</p>
<p>“It’s why we’re considered the most neutral of the isles. Perfect for
trade.” Narelle shrugs. “What you call gods, we call science. What you
call fate, we call coincidence. What you call the divine intervention of
love, we call…” She flourishes her hand. “Alchemy. Two substances
combined to make something entirely new, not unlike what’s between the
two of you.” She glances between Xaden and me and sets her hand on her
chest.</p>
<p>My heart twists. If she only knew how close she was to my very
thoughts earlier today.</p>
<p>She wiggles her finger at Xaden. “I heard you saying you’d kill my
grandson if he took another step toward your beloved, young man. How
illogically, toxically romantic of you. Have to admit, that kind of
confident violence isn’t what I pictured when Asher talked about you,
but the brown hair, those…I guess they’re brown eyes, and how utterly
smitten he predicted you two would eventually be for each other? Well,
he described you almost perfectly, Dain Aetos.”</p>
<p>Oh, fucking kill me now.</p>
<p>My mouth opens, then shuts.</p>
<p>Xaden raises both eyebrows and presses his lips between his
teeth.</p>
<p>Dain rubs the back of his neck.</p>
<p>Mira snorts once, covers her mouth with her hand, then doubles over
laughing. “I’m sorry,” she forces out and straightens, quickly masking
her face and clearing her throat, but she slips again, her shoulders
shaking. “I can’t. I just can’t. I need a second.” She walks behind the
row of shelves, hopefully to compose herself.</p>
<p>My face feels like it’s been blasted by dragon fire.</p>
<p>“How would you like this to go?” Dain asks me as Narelle glances
among the three of us, her silver brows knitting.</p>
<p>“Just like it’s gone for the last eighteen months,” Xaden answers,
losing any and all trace of the niceties he showed Dain an hour ago.
“Everyone assumes she’ll wind up with you, but it’s my last name she
ends up wearing on her flight jacket in formation.”</p>
<p>“Seriously?” Words absolutely fail me that he would go there. It was
one time. Fine, twice if I count the return trip from Samara after we
got back together.</p>
<p>“Glad to see you’re feeling like yourself again.” Dain leans back
against the counter. “But we don’t have last names on our flight
jackets.”</p>
<p>“And yet you get the fucking point.” Xaden’s jaw ticks.</p>
<p>Narelle’s gaze narrows on Xaden through her thick lenses. “You aren’t
Dain.”</p>
<p>Xaden shakes his head.</p>
<p>“I’m Dain.” Dain raises his hand briefly.</p>
<p>“And he is?” Narelle asks me.</p>
<p>“Xaden Riorson.” I lift my chin as if I’m answering to my father for
my choice. “And he’s mine, even when he’s being a possessive ass.”</p>
<p>“Fen Riorson’s son.” Narelle drums her gnarled fingertips on the
armrest. “Asher certainly didn’t predict that.”</p>
<p>“He would have if he’d ever met him.” I reach for Xaden’s hand and
lace our fingers.</p>
<p>“Our mother knew,” Mira says, taking her place at the end of the
bookshelf. “She wasn’t enthusiastic about it or anything, but she knew
love when she saw it. But she certainly never told us about our father
coming here.”</p>
<p>“She wouldn’t have, would she?” Narelle shifts in her seat. “When did
he die?”</p>
<p>“A little less than three years ago,” I answer gently. “His heart
failed.”</p>
<p>Narelle’s face crumples for a few sorrowful breaths, but she nods
through it as if having a conversation with herself, then lifts her head
again. “Your father risked all your lives to hide away his life’s work
with the sole purpose that you find it, Violet. He left the last of it
with me almost four years ago with explicit instructions that you only
be given it if you had attained the intelligence and understanding you
would need to comprehend it.”</p>
<p>I stiffen.</p>
<p>“That’s…” Dain shakes his head.</p>
<p>“That’s Dad,” Mira says slowly.</p>
<p>“You’ve got this.” Xaden squeezes my hand.</p>
<p>I fight to swallow the sudden lump in my dry throat. “He told me to
bring you the rarest item I possess.” An ironic laugh bubbles up. “And I
thought…” I shake my head, realizing the work we’ve gone through to haul
the satchel all this way has been for nothing.</p>
<p>“You thought it’s Deverelli, so naturally, we trade in goods,
treasures.” Narelle folds her hands in her lap.</p>
<p>“He meant my mind.” I glance at Mira, but her gaze is locked on the
floor. “That’s why he said not to send another in my stead.”</p>
<p>“The books are only for you,” Narelle confirms, and Leona perches on
the arm of her mother’s chair. “I have three simple questions, and if
you’re capable of answering them, the books are yours.”</p>
<p>“Arrogant to think you have any right to keep something our father
wrote for Violet based on your judgment.” Mira’s tone could grate
stone.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” I assure her, refusing to waver, even in this heat.
“Ask.”</p>
<p>Narelle shoots my sister a withering look and then turns her
attention to me. “He left a manuscript for you. What is the title?”</p>
<p>“Subjugated: The Second Uprising of the Krovlan People by Lieutenant
Colonel Asher Sorrengail,” I answer. “Which you already know that I
know. How else would I be here?”</p>
<p>She taps her forefinger in obvious impatience. “In chapter fourteen,
your father alludes to the Krovlan uprising falling apart because of
Deverelli but does not go into specifics. Any”—her gaze skims over my
black uniform—“scribe worth her wisdom wouldn’t have been satisfied with
his speculation. So tell me, what’s your hypothesis?”</p>
<p>Out of everything in the book, that’s what she asks?</p>
<p>“Easy. Krovla didn’t keep their part of whatever deal they made with
Deverelli. Rather than lose their reputation, Deverelli withdrew their
brokerage, hence the removal of the other isle’s troops, and then told
the Poromish king regent where to find the rebels. End of rebellion.” I
shrug.</p>
<p>“Not good enough.” She shakes her head, and my stomach sinks. “Why
did it fall apart? What was brokered?”</p>
<p>“That’s not fair—” Dain starts.</p>
<p>Narelle lifts a hand, demanding his silence. “She knows the
answer.”</p>
<p>I sigh. “I…have an idea. I just don’t like being wrong.” Or, in this
case, right.</p>
<p>“You’re among friends.” Her smile implies otherwise.</p>
<p>Fine. Sweat drips down the back of my neck, but I gather up the
courage to look like a fool. “I think they promised dragons and couldn’t
deliver.”</p>
<p>“They what?” Mira squawks.</p>
<p>Xaden tenses, and Dain pivots fully to face me, his eyes impossibly
wide, but Narelle’s slow smile tells me I’m either horrifically wrong—or
tragically right.</p>
<p>“Present your proof,” she says in a tone that reminds me eerily of
Markham. “Convince that one.” She points to Dain.</p>
<p>I tighten my grip on Xaden’s hand, and his thumb strokes over mine.
“Public Notice 433.323 acknowledges a failed border breach attempt by
Krovlan forces near the outpost of Athebyne on December eleventh, 433
AU, two days before the Midnight Massacre. The only other record of that
event exists in the journal of Colonel Hashbeigh, the commander of the
outpost, who oversaw the interrogations.” I look over at Dain. “Dad
drilled that into me while he was working on the manuscript, and I
didn’t understand why then, but obviously I get it now. I think it was
the year you were obsessed with the tactics of defeating Emerald Sea
piracy or something.”</p>
<p>Dain stiffens. “It was a really big problem in the fifth
century.”</p>
<p>I keep from rolling my eyes. “Stay with me here. We were on the
couch. Dad was pacing in front of the fire, and you thought it was
ludicrous that the soldiers had crossed into Navarre to acquire
tailfeathers, remember?”</p>
<p>He winces. “Right. Yes. And your father told me I was a lost cause if
I ever wanted to take the entrance exam for the Scribe Quadrant if I
couldn’t remember to apply my superior linguistics skills to all areas
of analyzing important historical data. Not that I ever wanted to be a
scribe, but still. Good times. Thank you for the reminder.”</p>
<p>“Is this going somewhere, or are we just enjoying a moment of
nostalgia?” Xaden asks.</p>
<p>“Apply your superior linguistics skills, Dain,” I prompt him. “The
interrogation was recorded in the common tongue—”</p>
<p>Dain’s eyes widen. “But the raiders spoke Krovlish, and descriptors
follow nouns in Krovlish. They were hunting feathertails. Dragons.”</p>
<p>I nod. “I think Deverelli brokered a deal with Krovla and an unnamed
isle that the isle would provide the army and Krovla would provide
dragons. When they were unable to do so, the deal fell apart, the
Midnight Massacre happened, and Krovla remained a part of Poromiel.”</p>
<p>Dain folds his arms across his chest. “They were dealing in dragons.”
He looks over to Narelle. “I believe her. It’s just going to take me a
minute to absorb it. One does not just…deal in dragons, let alone take
babies to isles that don’t have magic. Not when you risk the wrath of
the Empyrean.”</p>
<p>“Oh, wait until you realize that your dad knows my dad’s book has
something to do with feathertails, which means Dad knew to stop trusting
him at some point,” I add.</p>
<p>Dain’s face swings my way, and his stricken expression makes me wish
I could take the words back.</p>
<p>“Third question,” Narelle announces, and it feels particularly cruel,
given what she’s just put me through.</p>
<p>“Ask it.” My tone leaves something to be desired.</p>
<p>“What made you leave the prince?” She tilts her head to the side, and
her eyes light up like we’ve gathered for tea and gossip.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry?” I lean forward, like it’s at all possible I could have
misheard her.</p>
<p>“The prince?” She clasps her hands together. “Your father knew it
wouldn’t last, but I’d like to know the final straw.”</p>
<p>“Any chance you want to swoop down and set this shop on fire?” I ask
Tairn.</p>
<p>“As the Dark One said, it doesn’t bode well for international
relations,” he answers.</p>
<p>“I would,” Andarna offers. “But then you wouldn’t get your
books.”</p>
<p>“I…” The weight of every stare in the room flushes my skin so hot, I
feel on the edge of burnout without even a hint of magic. “I left him
because I found him in a delicate situation with one of his
professors.”</p>
<p>Narelle leans forward and lifts her eyebrows. “He was having sex with
a professor?”</p>
<p>“Mom!” Leona chides.</p>
<p>“What a fucking asshole,” Dain mutters. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
<p>“What were you going to do? Punch out the crown prince of Navarre?” I
counter.</p>
<p>Dain’s brow furrows.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Xaden answers. “Still might.”</p>
<p>“So you left him in a jealous rage even with the crown of Navarre in
your hands?” Narelle prods. “Did he come begging your forgiveness? Did
you take him back?”</p>
<p>I can definitely see why she owns a bookstore, and which genre might
just be her favorite. “I’ve never sought a crown, and besides, it’s not
in Halden’s nature to beg forgiveness of anyone. I closed the door and
didn’t bother speaking to him until a few weeks ago. He didn’t love me,
not in the way I deserve to be loved, and no amount of power is worth
staying with someone who doesn’t love you.”</p>
<p>“You know your value,” Narelle says softly with a nod. “Your father
would be proud. Get her the books.”</p>
<p>Leona stands, then leaves us waiting in the seating area while she
disappears into the back, and I deflate with relief, sagging against
Xaden’s side.</p>
<p>Mira slips her empty pack off her shoulders, then sets it on the
unoccupied chair next to Narelle. “I’ll carry them for Violet, unless of
course you think my father would have a problem with that. Promise not
to read them or anything.” Her biting tone sends a shiver of guilt
straight up my spine. Why was Dad so adamant only I collect them?</p>
<p>Narelle simply smiles and crosses her ankles in front of her. “And
that right there is why he didn’t leave them for you, dear. We all have
a part to play in what’s coming for us; this one is simply hers. While
he was busy raising Violet for this particular mission, your mother was
raising you. I wonder what legacy you’ve inherited.”</p>
<p>Mira’s eyes narrow.</p>
<p>We leave the bookstore ten minutes later with six tomes written by my
father. And every single one of them is passcode-locked.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, I lean my head back against the rim of the
carved wooden bathtub in the chamber adjacent to the bedroom Xaden and I
have been given and listen to birds I can’t identify chirp outside the
window above my feet. I’m too short to see the spectacular view of the
water, but the sky isn’t bad, either, softening with the colors of an
approaching sunset.</p>
<p>What time is it? I wonder if Halden’s back. If he’s managed to secure
permission for us to use Deverelli as a home post to visit the other
isles or broached the subject of the seventh breed. I reach for the bond
to ask Xaden, only to sigh with frustration at the instant reminder that
we don’t work that way here.</p>
<p>The breeze picks up the white curtains and billows them toward me as
the water chills to a temperature that might make me reach for hot water
at Basgiath but is definitely welcome here in Deverelli.</p>
<p>Though my toes are pruning, telling me it’s time to get out.</p>
<p>“Vi?” Xaden knocks on the door.</p>
<p>“You can come in.” A slow smile spreads across my face.</p>
<p>It slips completely when he opens the door and leans in wearing
nothing but a towel wrapped around his hips. Gods, is he perfectly
beautiful. Wet hair. Still a little scruffy. Water droplets clinging to
the lines of his muscles. Abs for days and days and days.</p>
<p>“Just letting you know I’m back…” The words die as his gaze catches
on my bare shoulders, which is all I’m pretty sure he can see given the
height of this tub. Well, my shoulders and my very wet, very unbound
hair. “Damn. Just…damn.”</p>
<p>“I said you should have stayed and had a bath in our room. Lots of
space in here. You didn’t need to go borrow Ridoc’s.” I tap the copper
pipe at the foot of the tub with my toe. “They really do have some
pretty fabulous plumbing.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” His eyes darken and his grip on the door handle whitens. “I
figured it was polite to give you time to soak your muscles to help
recover after all that riding.”</p>
<p>“Polite? How very kind of you.” I gather all my hair in my hand and
pull it over my left shoulder so it’s ready to wring out, then hit the
lever with my foot to start draining the tub, trying to focus anywhere
but on him and that incredible body he insists on walking around in.</p>
<p>“And do you feel recovered?” His voice lowers.</p>
<p>“A little exposed after being interrogated about my intelligence and
my love life, but otherwise fine.” Reaching to the right, I grab the
soft white towel I left on the little bench as the water empties with a
gurgle, then turn my back to Xaden and stand, quickly wrapping the towel
around me.</p>
<p>“You’re fine,” he repeats. “Not dizzy. Not sore. Not tired? Because
we just flew all last night.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I want to go climb the Gauntlet or anything”—I lean
left, wringing my hair out over the tub—“but yes, I’m feeling as good as
it gets.” Clean, fed, and ready to curl up with the man I love.</p>
<p>“Good,” he says against my ear, and I gasp with surprise as he grabs
hold of my waist and turns me to face him. “Because I’m done being
polite.”</p>
<p>His mouth crashes into mine.</p>
<p>The most useless word in the language of aristocracy has always been
and will forever be: love. Marriage is a necessary evil to secure the
line. Nothing more. Save love for your children.</p>
