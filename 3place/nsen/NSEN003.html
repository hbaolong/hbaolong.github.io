<h4 id="chapter-one">Chapter One</h4>
<p>Two weeks later</p>
<p>Flying in January should be a violation of the Codex. Between the
howling storm and the incessant fog in my goggles, I can’t see shit as
we cut through the blustering snow squall above the mountains near
Basgiath. Hoping we’re almost through the worst of it, I grip the
pommels of my saddle with gloved hands and hold tight.</p>
<p>“Dying today would be inconvenient,” I say down the mental pathway
connecting me to Tairn and Andarna. “Unless you’re trying to keep me
away from the Senarium this afternoon?” I’ve waited more than a week for
the invitation-disguised order to come from the king’s council, but the
delay is understandable given they’re on the fourth day of unprecedented
peace talks happening on campus. Poromiel has publicly declared they’ll
walk after the seventh day if terms can’t be reached, and it isn’t
looking good. I only hope that they’ll be in an agreeable mood when I
arrive.</p>
<p>“Want to make your meeting? Don’t fall off this time,” Tairn
retorts.</p>
<p>“For the last time, I didn’t fall off,” I argue. “I jumped off to
help Sawyer—”</p>
<p>“Don’t remind me.”</p>
<p>“You can’t keep leaving me off patrols,” Andarna interrupts from the
warmth and protection of the Vale.</p>
<p>“It isn’t safe,” Tairn reminds her for what has to be the hundredth
time. “Weather aside, we’re hunting dark wielders, not out for a
pleasure flight.”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t fly in this,” I agree, looking for any sign of Ridoc
and Aotrom, but there’s only walls of white. My chest tightens. How are
any of us supposed to see topography or our squadmates, let alone spot a
dark wielder hundreds of feet below in this mess? I can’t remember a
more brutal series of storms than the ones that have battered the war
college in the last two weeks, but without—</p>
<p>Mom. Grief sinks the tips of her razor-sharp claws into my chest, and
I lift my face to feel the stinging bite of snow against the tops of my
cheeks, focusing on anything else to keep breathing, keep moving. I’ll
mourn later, always later.</p>
<p>“It’s just a quick patrol,” Andarna whines, jarring me from my
thoughts. “I need the practice. Who knows what weather we’ll encounter
on the search for my kind?”</p>
<p>“Quick patrols” have proven deadly, and I’m not looking for reasons
to test Andarna’s fire theory. Dark wielders may have limited power
within the wards, but they’re still lethal fighters. The ones who didn’t
escape post-battle have used the element of surprise to add multiple
names to the death roll. First Wing, Third Wing, and our own Claw
Section have suffered losses.</p>
<p>“Then practice evenly dispersing enough magic to keep all your
extremities warm during flight, because your wings won’t hold the weight
of this ice,” Tairn growls into the falling snow.</p>
<p>“‘Your wings won’t hold the weight of this ice,’” Andarna blatantly
mocks him. “And yet yours miraculously carry the burden of your
ego.”</p>
<p>“Go find a sheep and let the adults work.” Tairn’s muscles shift
slightly beneath me in a familiar pattern, and I lean forward as far as
the saddle will allow, preparing for a dive.</p>
<p>My stomach lurches into my throat as his wings snap closed and we
pitch downward, slicing through the storm. Wind tears at my winter
flight hood, and the leather strap of my saddle bites into my frozen
thighs as I pray to Zihnal there isn’t a mountain peak directly beneath
us.</p>
<p>Tairn levels out, and my stomach settles as I tug my goggles up to my
forehead and blink quickly, looking right. The drop in altitude has
lessened the intensity of the storm, improving visibility enough to see
the rocky ridgeline just above the flight field.</p>
<p>“Looks clear.” My eyes tear up, assaulted by both wind and snow that
feels more like tiny projectiles of ice than flakes. I clean my lenses
using the suede tips of my gloves before snapping them over my eyes
again.</p>
<p>“Agreed. Once we hear the same from Feirge and Cruth, we’ll end
today’s endeavors,” he grumbles.</p>
<p>“You sound like making it three straight days without encountering
the enemy is a bad thing.” Maybe we’ve really caught and killed them
all. As cadets, we’ve slain thirty-one venin in the area surrounding
Basgiath while our professors work to clear the rest of the province. It
would be thirty-two if anyone suspected one of them was living among us,
though—even if he’s credited with seventeen of the kills.</p>
<p>“I am not comforted by the quiet—” Wind whips overhead with a crack,
and Tairn’s head jerks upward. Mine immediately follows suit.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Not wind. Wings.</p>
<p>Aotrom’s claws consume my vision, and my heart seizes with panic.
He’s dropping out of the storm directly on top of us.</p>
<p>“Tairn!” I shout, but he’s already rolling left, hurling us from our
course.</p>
<p>The world rotates, sky and land exchanging places twice in a
nauseating dance before Tairn flares his wings in a jarring snap. The
movement cracks the inch-thick layer of ice along the front ridges of
his wings, and chunks fall away.</p>
<p>I draw a full but shaky breath as Tairn pumps his wings with maximum
effort, gaining a hundred feet of altitude in a matter of seconds and
barreling straight toward the Brown Swordtail bonded to Ridoc.</p>
<p>Wrath scalds the air in my lungs, Tairn’s emotions flooding my system
for a heartbeat before I can slam my mental shields down to muffle the
worst of what streams in through the bond.</p>
<p>“Don’t!” I shout into the wind as we come up on Aotrom’s left, but as
always, Tairn does whatever he wants and full-on crunches his jaws
within what looks like inches of Aotrom’s head. “It was clearly an
accident!” One that would usually be avoided by dragons
communicating.</p>
<p>The smaller Brown Swordtail squawks as Tairn repeats the warning,
then Aotrom exposes his throat in a gesture of submission.</p>
<p>Ridoc looks my way through the band of snow and throws up his hands,
but I doubt he sees my shrug of apology before Aotrom falls away,
heading south to the flight field.</p>
<p>Guess Feirge and Rhi reported in.</p>
<p>“Was that really necessary?” I drop my shields, and Tairn’s and
Andarna’s bonds come flooding back at full strength, but the shimmering
pathway that leads to Xaden is still blocked, dimmed to an echo of its
usual presence. The loss of constant connection sucks, but he doesn’t
trust himself—or what he thinks he’ll become—to keep it open yet.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Tairn answers, declaring the single word sufficient.</p>
<p>“You’re almost twice his size and it was obviously an accident,” I
repeat as we descend rapidly to the flight field. The snow on the ground
of the box canyon has been trampled into a muddy series of paths from
the constant patrols second- and third-years are flying.</p>
<p>“It was negligent, and a twenty-two-year-old dragon should know
better than to close himself off from his riot simply because he’s
arguing with his rider,” Tairn grumbles, his anger lowering to a simmer
as Aotrom lands beside Rhi’s Green Daggertail, Feirge.</p>
<p>Tairn’s claws impact the frozen ground to Aotrom’s left, and the
sudden landing vibrates every bone in my body like a rung bell. Pain
explodes along my spine, my lower back taking the brunt of the insult. I
breathe through the worst of it, then accept the rest and move on.
“Well, that was graceful.” I jerk my goggles to my forehead.</p>
<p>“You fly next time.” He shakes like a wet hound, and I block my face
with my hands as ice and snow fly off his scales.</p>
<p>I tug at the leather strap of my saddle when he stills, but the
buckle catches along the jagged, shitty line of stitches I put in after
the battle, and one of them pops. “Damn it. That wouldn’t have happened
if you’d let Xaden fix it.” I force my body out of the saddle, ignoring
the aching protest of my cold-cramped joints as I make my way across the
icy pattern of spikes and scales I know as well as my own hand.</p>
<p>“The Dark One didn’t cut it in the first place,” Tairn responds.</p>
<p>“Stop calling him that.” My knee collapses, and I throw my arms out
to steady my balance, cursing my joints as I reach Tairn’s shoulder.
After an hour in the saddle at these temperatures, a pissed-off knee is
nothing; I’m lucky my hips still rotate.</p>
<p>“Stop denying the truth.” Tairn enunciates every word of the damning
order as I avoid a patch of ice and prepare to dismount. “His soul is no
longer his own.”</p>
<p>“That’s a little dramatic.” I’m not getting into this argument again.
“His eyes are back to normal—”</p>
<p>“That kind of power is addictive. You know it, or you wouldn’t be
pretending to sleep at night.” He twists his neck in a way that reminds
me of a snake and levels a golden glare on me.</p>
<p>“I’m sleeping.” It’s not entirely a lie, but definitely time to
change the subject. “Did you make me repair my saddle to teach me a
lesson?” My ass protests every scale on Tairn’s leg as I slide, then
land in a fresh foot of snow. “Or because you don’t trust Xaden with my
gear anymore?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Tairn lifts his head far over mine and blasts a torrent of
fire along his wing, melting off the residual ice, and I turn away from
the surge of heat that painfully contrasts my body temperature.</p>
<p>“Tairn…” I struggle for words and look up at him. “I need to know
where you stand before this meeting. With or without Empyrean approval,
I can’t do any of this without you.”</p>
<p>“Meaning, will I support the myriad of ways you plan to court death
in the name of curing one who is beyond redemption?” He swivels his head
in my direction again.</p>
<p>Tension crackles along Andarna’s bond.</p>
<p>“He’s not—” I cut off that particular argument, since the rest is
sound. “Basically, yes.”</p>
<p>He grumbles deep within his chest. “I fly without warming my wings in
preparation for carrying heavier weight for longer distances. Does that
not answer your question?”</p>
<p>Meaning Andarna. Relief gusts through my lips on a swift exhale.
“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Steam rolls in billowing clouds from his nostrils. “But do not
mistake my unflinching support of you, my mate, and Andarna for any form
of faith in him.” Tairn lifts his head, cueing the end of the
conversation.</p>
<p>“Heard.” On that note, I trudge toward the trampled path where Rhi
and Quinn wait. Ridoc gives Tairn a wide berth as he does the same to my
right. My nearly numb, gloved fingers fumble with the three buttons on
the side of my winter flight hood, and the fur-lined fabric falls away
from my nose and mouth as I reach them. “Everything good on your
route?”</p>
<p>Rhi and Quinn look cold but uninjured, thank gods.</p>
<p>“Still…alarmingly routine. We didn’t see anything of concern. Wyvern
burn pit is still just ash and bone, too.” Rhi picks a clump of snow
from the lining of her hood, then pulls it back up over her
shoulder-length black braids.</p>
<p>“We didn’t see shit for those last ten minutes, period.” Ridoc shoves
his gloved hand into his hair, snowflakes slipping off his brown cheeks
without melting.</p>
<p>“At least you’re an ice wielder.” I gesture to his annoyingly
flake-free face.</p>
<p>Quinn pulls her blond curls into a quick bun. “Wielding can help keep
you warm, too.”</p>
<p>“I’m not chancing it when I can’t see what I might strike.”
Especially having lost my only conduit in the battle. I glance at Ridoc
as a line of our Tail Section’s dragons launch for their patrol behind
him. “What were you arguing with Aotrom about, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Sorry about that.” Ridoc cringes and lowers his voice. “He wants to
go home—back to Aretia. Says we can launch the search for the seventh
breed from there.”</p>
<p>Rhi nods, and Quinn presses her lips in a firm line.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I get that,” I say—it’s a common sentiment among the riot.
We’re not exactly welcome here. The unity between Navarrian and Aretian
riders crumbled within hours of the battle’s end. “But the only path for
an alliance that can save Poromish civilians requires us to be here. At
least for now.”</p>
<p>Not to mention, Xaden insists we stay.</p>
<p>“He remains because Navarre’s wards protect you from him.” Tairn
blasts another stream of fire when I ignore him, heating his left wing,
then crouches before launching skyward with the others.</p>
<p>The courtyard is nearly empty when we enter through the tunnel that
runs under the ridgeline separating it from the training grounds. In
front of us, snow tops the dormitory wing, the centered rotunda that
links the quadrant’s structures, and all but the southernmost roofline
of the academic wing ahead to our left, where Malek’s fire burns bright
in the highest turret, consuming the belongings of our dead as he
requires.</p>
<p>Maybe the god of death will curse me for keeping my mother’s personal
journals, but it’s not like I wouldn’t have a few choice words for him
should we meet, anyway.</p>
<p>“Report,” Aura Beinhaven orders from the dais at our left, where she
stands with Ewan Faber—the stocky, sour-faced wingleader of what little
remains of Navarre’s Fourth Wing.</p>
<p>“Oh, good, you all made it back.” Ewan’s voice drips with sarcasm as
he folds his arms, snow falling on his broad shoulders. “We were so
worried.”</p>
<p>“Prick was barely a squad leader in Claw when we left,” Ridoc
mutters.</p>
<p>“Nothing this morning,” Rhiannon replies, and Aura nods but doesn’t
deign to say anything. “Any news from the front?”</p>
<p>My stomach knots. The lack of information is agonizing.</p>
<p>“Nothing I’d be willing to share with a bunch of deserters,” Aura
answers.</p>
<p>Oh, screw her.</p>
<p>“A bunch of deserters who saved your ass!” Quinn offers a middle
finger as we continue past, our boots crunching on the snow-covered
gravel. “Navarrian riders, Aretian riders… We can’t function like this,”
she says to the group quietly. “If they won’t accept us, the fliers
don’t have a prayer.”</p>
<p>I nod in agreement. Mira’s working on that particular issue—not that
leadership knows or will allow the use of whatever she’s learned, even
if it saves the negotiations. Pompous assholes.</p>
<p>“Devera and Kaori will be back any day. They’ll sort out command
structure as soon as the royals ink a treaty that hopefully pardons us
for leaving in the first place.” Rhi cocks her head as Imogen walks out
of the rotunda in front of us, her pink hair skimming her cheekbone as
she descends the stone steps. “Cardulo, you missed patrol.”</p>
<p>“I was assigned elsewhere by Lieutenant Tavis,” Imogen explains, not
missing a beat as she comes our way. Her gaze jumps toward me.
“Sorrengail, I need a word.”</p>
<p>I nod. She was on Xaden duty.</p>
<p>“See that you’re present tomorrow.” Rhi walks past Imogen with the
other two, then pauses halfway up the steps and glances over her
shoulder as the others head inside. “Wait. Is Mira due back today?”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow.” Anxiety ties a pretty little bow around my throat and
tugs. It’s one thing to form a plan and quite another to carry it out,
especially when the consequences could involve the people I love
becoming traitors…again.</p>
<p>“Every possible path,” Andarna reminds me.</p>
<p>“Every possible path,” I repeat like a mantra and straighten my
shoulders.</p>
<p>“Good.” A slow smile spreads across Rhi’s face. “We’ll be in the
infirmary when you’re done,” she promises, then walks up the remaining
steps to the rotunda.</p>
<p>“You told the second-years what Mira’s up to?” Imogen whispers with a
sharp bite of accusation.</p>
<p>“Only the riders,” I retort just as quietly. “If we get caught, it’s
treason, but if the fliers do—”</p>
<p>“It’s war,” Imogen finishes.</p>
<p>“Ridoc, did you freeze this door shut?” Rhi shouts from the top of
the steps, yanking on the door handle of the rotunda with her full body
weight before marching through its counterpart to her left. “Get back
here and fix it, now!”</p>
<p>“Right. Telling them was a solid choice.” Imogen rubs the bridge of
her nose as Ridoc laughs hysterically from inside the rotunda. “The four
of you are a fucking nuisance. It’s going to be a miracle if we pull
this off without getting ourselves executed.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be involved.” I stare her down in a way I never
would have dreamed of eighteen months ago. “I’ll do it with or without
your help.”</p>
<p>“Feeling snarky, are we?” A corner of her mouth tugs upward. “Relax.
As long as Mira figures out a plan, of course I’m in.”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t know how to fail.”</p>
<p>“I can see that.” Snow blows across our faces as Imogen’s eyes
harden. “But please say you didn’t tell your fearsome foursome
everything about why we’re doing this.”</p>
<p>“Of course not.” I shove my gloves into my pocket. “He’s still pissed
at me for ‘burdening you’ with the knowledge.”</p>
<p>“Then he should stop doing stupid shit that needs to be covered up.”
She rubs her hands together in the cold and follows me up the steps.
“Look, I needed you alone because Garrick, Bodhi, and I talked—”</p>
<p>“Without me?” My spine stiffens.</p>
<p>“About you,” she clarifies unapologetically.</p>
<p>“Even better.” I reach for the door.</p>
<p>“We’ve decided you need to rethink your sleeping arrangements.”</p>
<p>My grip tightens on the handle and I contemplate slamming the door in
her face. “I’ve decided you can all go fuck yourselves. I’m not running
from him. Even in the moments he’s lost control, he’s never hurt me. He
never will.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I told them you’d say, but don’t be surprised if they
keep asking. Good to know you’re still predictable even if Riorson
isn’t.”</p>
<p>“How was he this morning?” Heat rushes over my face as we walk into
the empty rotunda, and I push back my hood. Without classes, formation,
or any sense of order, the academic wing might sit abandoned, but
commons and the gathering hall are congested with aimless, worried,
agitated cadets hoping to survive the next patrol and looking to take
their frustrations out on someone else. Every single one of us would
kill for a Battle Brief.</p>
<p>“Surly and stubborn as always,” Imogen answers when we cross into the
dormitory, quieting as we pass a group of glaring second-years from
First Wing, including Caroline Ashton, which means the truth-sayers
cleared her. Lucky for us, the steps leading down to the Healer Quadrant
are blessedly empty. “You consider telling him what we’re up to?”</p>
<p>“He’s aware we’ll be sent to find Andarna’s kind. As for the rest? He
doesn’t want to know.” I nod at a pair of approaching Aretian riders out
of Third Wing when we reach the tunnels but wait to speak until we’re
out of earshot. “He’s worried about being an unintentional leak—which is
ridiculous, but I’m respecting his wishes.”</p>
<p>“I can’t wait for him to discover you’re leading your own rebellion.”
She grins as we walk across the enclosed bridge to the Healer
Quadrant.</p>
<p>“It’s not a rebellion, and I’m not…leading.” Xaden, Dain, Rhi—they’re
leaders. They inspire and command for the good of the unit. I’m just
doing whatever it takes to save Xaden.</p>
<p>“Including the mission to find Andarna’s kind?” She throws open the
door to the Healer Quadrant, and I follow her in.</p>
<p>“That’s different, and I’m not leading as much as I am selecting a
leader. Hopefully.” I glance down the cluttered tunnel, past the quietly
sleeping patients dressed mostly in infantry blue, and spot a group of
hooded scribes moving among them, no doubt still working to get accurate
accounts of the battle. “Sounds the same, but it’s not.”</p>
<p>“Right.” The word drips with sarcasm. “Well, message delivered, so
I’m done with this conversation. Let me know when Mira gets back.” She
walks off toward main campus. “Give Sawyer my best, and good luck this
afternoon!”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I call after her, then turn toward the infirmary. The
scents of herbs and metal hit my lungs as I enter through the double
doors. I wave at Trager on my right, who’s among the healing-trained
fliers doing their best to help where they can.</p>
<p>He nods back from a patient’s bedside, then reaches for a needle and
thread.</p>
<p>I continue quickly to the nearest corner, moving from the healers’
paths as they scurry in and out of the curtain-lined bays where rows of
the injured rest.</p>
<p>Ridoc’s laugh sounds from the last bay as I approach. The pale blue
curtains are tied back, revealing a pile of discarded winter flight
jackets in the corner and every other second-year in our squad crammed
around Sawyer’s bed.</p>
<p>“Stop exaggerating,” Rhiannon says from the wooden chair near
Sawyer’s head, shaking her finger at Ridoc, who’s sitting on the bed,
right where our squadmate’s lower leg used to be. “I simply told them
that it was our squad’s table and they needed to—”</p>
<p>“Take their cowardly asses back to the First Wing section where they
belonged,” Ridoc finishes for her with another laugh.</p>
<p>“You didn’t really say that.” A corner of Sawyer’s mouth quirks
upward, but it’s far from a true smile.</p>
<p>“She did.” I’m careful not to step on Cat’s outstretched legs on the
floor beside Maren as I move into the cramped space, unbuttoning my
flight jacket and tossing it onto the pile.</p>
<p>“Riders get offended by the weirdest things.” Cat arches a dark brow
and flips through Markham’s history textbook. “We have far bigger issues
than tables.”</p>
<p>“True.” Maren nods, plaiting her dark-brown hair into a four-strand
braid.</p>
<p>“How was patrol, anyway?” Sawyer scoots to a more upright position
without any help.</p>
<p>“Quiet,” Ridoc answers. “I’m starting to think we’ve gotten them
all.”</p>
<p>“Or they’ve managed to flee,” Sawyer muses, the light fading from his
eyes. “You’ll be chasing them down soon.”</p>
<p>“Not until we graduate.” Rhi crosses her legs. “They’re not sending
cadets beyond the borders.”</p>
<p>“Except Violet, of course, who will be off seeking the seventh breed
so we can win this war.” Ridoc glances my way with a shit-eating grin.
“Don’t worry, I’ll keep her safe.”</p>
<p>I can’t quite tell if he’s teasing or serious.</p>
<p>Cat snorts and flips another page. “Like they’re going to let you go?
Guarantee it’ll be officers only.”</p>
<p>“No way.” Ridoc shakes his head. “It’s her dragon, her rules. Right,
Vi?”</p>
<p>Every head turns in my direction. “Assuming they put us on orders,
I’ll provide a list of people I trust to go.” A list that’s been through
so many drafts, I’m not even sure I’m carrying the right one.</p>
<p>“You should take the squad,” Sawyer suggests. “We work best as a
team.” He scoffs. “Who am I kidding. You’ll work best as a team. I’m
barely climbing stairs.” He nods to the crutches beside his bed.</p>
<p>“You’re still on the team. Hydrate.” Rhi reaches across the bedside
table and over a note that looks to be in Jesinia’s handwriting to grab
a pewter mug.</p>
<p>“Water’s not going to grow my leg back.” Sawyer takes it, and the
metal handle hisses, forming to his grip. He looks up at me. “I know
that’s a shitty thing to say after you lost your mother—”</p>
<p>“Pain isn’t a competition,” I assure him. “There’s always enough to
go around.”</p>
<p>He sighs. “I got a visit from Colonel Chandlyr.”</p>
<p>My stomach hollows. “The commander of the retired riders?”</p>
<p>Sawyer nods.</p>
<p>“What?” Ridoc folds his arms. “Second-years don’t retire. Die? Yes.
Retire? No.”</p>
<p>“I get that,” Sawyer starts. “I just—”</p>
<p>A shrill scream echoes throughout the infirmary in a knee-wavering
pitch that’s reserved for something far worse than pain—terror. The
silence that follows chills me to the bone, apprehension lifting the
hair on the back of my neck as I unsheathe two of my daggers and turn to
face the threat.</p>
<p>“What was that?” Ridoc slides off Sawyer’s bed, and the others move
behind me as I step outside the bay and pivot toward the open infirmary
doors.</p>
<p>“She’s dead!” A cadet in infantry blue stumbles in and falls to his
hands and knees. “They’re all dead!”</p>
<p>There’s no mistaking the gray handprint marking the side of his
neck.</p>
<p>Venin.</p>
<p>My heart seizes. We haven’t found them out on patrol—because they’re
already inside.</p>
<p>The rarest of signets—those that rise once in a generation or
century—have manifested concurrently with an equal twice in our records,
both critical times in our history, but only once have the six most
powerful walked the Continent simultaneously. As fascinating as that
spectacle must have been, I would rather not live to see it happen
again.</p>
