<h4 id="prologue">Prologue</h4>
<p>Where in Malek’s name is he going? I hurry through the tunnels
beneath the quadrant, trying to follow, but night is the ultimate shadow
and Xaden blends seamlessly into the darkness. If it wasn’t for our
dragons’ bond leading me in his general direction and the sporadic
disappearance of mage lights, I’d never think that he’s masked somewhere
ahead of me.</p>
<p>Fear holds me with an icy fist, and my footing grows unsteady. He
kept his head down this evening, guarded by Bodhi and Garrick while we
waited for news about Sawyer’s injury after the battle that nearly cost
us Basgiath, but there’s no telling what he’s doing now. If anyone spots
the faint, strawberry-red circles around his irises, he’ll be
arrested—and likely executed. According to the texts I’ve read, they’ll
fade at this phase, but until they do, what could possibly be important
enough for him to risk being seen?</p>
<p>The only logical answer sends a chill up my spine that has nothing to
do with the cold stone of the corridor seeping in through my socks.
There hadn’t been time for boots or even my armor after the click of the
closing door woke me from a restless sleep.</p>
<p>“Neither of them will answer,” Andarna says, and I yank open the door
to the enclosed bridge as its counterpart on the far end snicks shut.
Was that him? “Sgaeyl is still…incensed, and Tairn smells of both rage
and sorrow.”</p>
<p>Understandable for all the reasons I can’t allow myself to dwell on
yet, but inconvenient.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to ask Cuir or Chradh—” she starts.</p>
<p>“No. The four of them need their sleep.” No doubt we’ll find
ourselves on patrols for any remaining venin come morning. I cross the
freezing expanse of the bridge with increasingly uncertain steps and
jolt at the view outside the windows. It had been warm enough for
thunderstorms earlier, but now snow falls in a thick curtain, concealing
the ravine that separates the quadrant from Basgiath’s main campus. My
chest clenches, and a fresh wave of seemingly endless tears threatens to
prickle my painfully swollen eyes.</p>
<p>“It began about an hour ago,” Andarna says gently.</p>
<p>The temperature has fallen steadily in the hours since… Don’t go
there. My next breath shakes, and I force everything I can’t handle into
a neat, mentally fireproof box and stash it somewhere deep inside
me.</p>
<p>It’s too late to save Mom, but I’ll be damned if I let Xaden get
himself killed.</p>
<p>“You can grieve,” Andarna reminds me as I pull open the door to the
Healer Quadrant and enter the crowded hall. Wounded in every color of
uniform line the sides of the stone tunnel, and healers dart in and out
of the infirmary doors.</p>
<p>“If I wallow in every loss, that’s all I’ll ever have time for.” I’ve
learned that lesson well over the past eighteen months. Passing a set of
clearly intoxicated infantry cadets, I cut through what’s become an
expanded sickbay, searching for a blur of darkness. This part of the
quadrant didn’t sustain any damage, but it still reeks of sulfur and
ash.</p>
<p>“May your mother be remembered! To General Sorrengail, the flame of
Basgiath!” one of the third-years calls out, and my stomach twists
tighter as I forge ahead without reply.</p>
<p>When I approach the corner, then turn it, I see a patch of darkness
enveloping the right side of the wall for a stuttering heartbeat, and
then the stairwell to the interrogation chamber appears, flanked by two
groggy guards. Shadows slip down the steps.</p>
<p>Fuck. Usually I love being right, but in this instance, I was hoping
otherwise. I reach for Xaden mentally, but there’s only a thick wall of
chilled onyx.</p>
<p>I have to get past these guards. What would Mira do?</p>
<p>“She would have already slain your lieutenant and been confident in
her choice,” Andarna answers. “Your sister is an act first, ask
questions later kind of rider.”</p>
<p>“Not helpful.” What little I’d eaten for dinner threatens to
reappear. Andarna’s right. Mira will kill Xaden if she finds out he’s
channeled from the earth, regardless of the circumstances. But
confidence? That’s not a bad idea. I muster every ounce of arrogance I
can scrounge up or fake, straighten my shoulders, lift my chin, and
stride toward the guards, praying I look steadier than I feel. “I need
an audience with the prisoner.”</p>
<p>The two men glance at each other, and then the taller one on the left
clears his throat. “We’re under orders from Melgren not to allow anyone
down these steps.”</p>
<p>“Tell me”—I tilt my head and fold my arms like I’m strapped with
every dagger I own…or am at least wearing footwear—“if the man directly
responsible for your mother’s death was a flight of stairs away, what
would you do?”</p>
<p>The shorter one looks down, revealing a cut beneath his ear.</p>
<p>“Orders—” the taller one starts, glancing at the ends of my
sleep-loosened braid.</p>
<p>“He’s behind a locked door,” I interrupt. “I’m asking you to look the
other way for five minutes, not give me the key.” My gaze darts
poignantly to the key ring hanging on his bloodstained belt. “If it had
been your mother, and she’d secured the kingdom’s entire defense system
with her life, I promise I’d afford you the same courtesy.”</p>
<p>The tall one blanches.</p>
<p>“Goverson,” the short one whispers. “She’s the lightning
wielder.”</p>
<p>Goverson grunts, and his hands flex at his sides. “Ten minutes,” he
says. “Five for your mother, and five for you. We know who saved us
today.” He motions toward the stairwell with his head.</p>
<p>But he doesn’t know. None of them realize the sacrifice Xaden made to
kill the Sage…their general.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” I start down the stairs with wobbling knees, ignoring
the pungent scent of wet earth that claws at the outer edges of my
composure. “I can’t believe he came down here.”</p>
<p>“He probably seeks information,” Andarna notes. “I cannot blame him
for wanting to know what he is.” The longing in her voice startles me on
multiple levels.</p>
<p>“He isn’t a soulless venin. He’s still Xaden. My Xaden,” I snap,
holding tight to the only thing I’m certain of as I make my way silently
down the stairs.</p>
<p>“You know what channeling from the earth does,” she warns.</p>
<p>Know? Yes. Accept? Absolutely not. “If he’d completely lost himself,
he would have drained me at any number of points tonight, especially
while I slept. Instead, he ensured our safety and risked exposure to sit
at my side for hours. He channeled from the earth once. Surely we can
repair wherever his soul may have…cracked.” It’s the most I’m willing to
admit. “I already know what Tairn thinks, and the possibility of
fighting both of you is exhausting, so please, for the love of Amari, be
on my side.”</p>
<p>The bond directly between us shimmers. “All right.”</p>
<p>“Really?” I pause on the stair, splaying my hand on the wall to catch
my balance.</p>
<p>“I am as unknown as he is, and you still trust me,” she says. “I will
not be another battle you have to fight.”</p>
<p>Oh, thank gods. Her words seep into the marrow of my bones, and I
hang my head in relief. I hadn’t realized how badly I needed to hear
that until she said it. “Thank you. And you have every right to know
about where you come from, but I have no doubts about who you are.” I
start down the remaining steps, sure of my footing. “You alone should
make the choice to find your family, and I’m worried that Melgren—”</p>
<p>“I scorched the venin during the battle,” she interrupts in a rush of
words that run together.</p>
<p>“You…did.” My brow puckers as I spiral downward toward the
interrogation cells. I’d been too shocked at her appearance, the way her
scales had shifted, to think about the burning dark wielder. As far as I
know, we’ve never caught one on fire. Tairn hadn’t said anything,
either.</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about it all night. Magic feels different when I
change color. Maybe my use of power in that moment altered the venin,
weakened her enough to blister.” Andarna slows enough to enunciate her
words, but not by much.</p>
<p>“That could alter…everything.” Muffled voices sound beneath me, and I
quicken my pace. “It’s definitely worth investigating later.” Not that
I’m willing to risk Andarna by shouting that she might be our newest
weapon, especially not when the rumor has already circulated that we’ll
seek an alliance with Poromiel. What could be worse than leadership
endangering Andarna? The whole Continent’s leadership seeking to do the
same.</p>
<p>“You can fight it all you want, but that power streaming through her
veins?” Jack taunts, his words growing clearer as I near the final few
turns. “There’s a reason the higher-ups want her. A little brotherly
advice? Fall in line and find someone else to fuck. That infamous
control of yours so much as flickers in her direction—”</p>
<p>“I would never,” Xaden retorts, his voice lethally icy.</p>
<p>My heart rate doubles and I halt just before the last curve in the
stairwell, keeping out of sight. Jack’s talking about me.</p>
<p>“Even you don’t get a say in which parts of us are taken first,
Riorson.” Jack laughs. “But speaking from personal experience, control
goes quickly. Just look at you, freshly fed from the source and already
down here, desperate for a cure. You will slip, and afterward… Well,
let’s just say that silver hair that has you so besotted will be gray
like the rest of her, and those weak-ass initiate rings in your eyes
won’t just last a few days—they’ll be permanent.”</p>
<p>“Not going to happen.” Xaden bites out every word.</p>
<p>“You could deliver her yourself.” Chains rattle. “Or you could let me
out and we’ll do it together. Who knows, they might let her live just to
keep you on a leash until you turn asim and forget all about her.”</p>
<p>“Fuck you.”</p>
<p>My hands ball into fists. Jack knows Xaden’s channeled. He’ll tell
the first person who questions him, and Xaden will be arrested. My mind
spins as the two start to argue only yards away, their words blurring in
the whirlwind of my thoughts. Gods, I could lose Xaden just like—</p>
<p>I can’t. I won’t. I refuse to lose him, for him to lose himself.</p>
<p>Fear fights to rise and I snuff it out, denying it air to breathe or
grow. The only thing stronger than the power prowling within me is the
resolve stiffening my spine.</p>
<p>Xaden is mine. My heart, my soul, my everything. He channeled from
the earth to save me, and I’ll scour the world until I find a way to
save him right back. Even if it takes bargaining with Tecarus for access
to every book on the damned Continent or capturing dark wielders one by
one to question, I’ll find a cure.</p>
<p>“We’ll find a cure,” Andarna promises. “We will exhaust every closer
resource first, but if I’m right and I somehow altered that venin
inadvertently while changing my scales, then the rest of my kind should
know how to master the tactic. How to change him. Cure him.”</p>
<p>My breath stutters at the possibility, the cost. “Even if you’re
right, I’m not using you—”</p>
<p>“I want to find my family. We both know the order to locate my kind
is inevitable now that your leadership knows what I am. Let us do so on
our terms and for our own purposes.” Her tone sharpens. “Let us follow
every possible path to a cure.”</p>
<p>She’s right. “Every possible path may require breaking a few
laws.”</p>
<p>“Dragons do not answer to the laws of humans,” she counters in a tone
that reminds me of Tairn. “And as my bonded, as Tairn’s rider, you no
longer answer to them, either.”</p>
<p>“Rebellious adolescent,” I mutter, forming half a dozen plans, half
of which might work. Even as their rider, there are still some crimes
that would demand my execution…and that of whomever I trust to involve.
I nod to myself, accepting the risk, at least for myself.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to keep secrets again,” Andarna warns.</p>
<p>“Only the ones that protect Xaden.” Which currently means preventing
Jack from revealing this conversation without killing him, since we
can’t afford the manhunt the death of our only prisoner would cause.</p>
<p>“You sure I shouldn’t ask Cuir or Chradh—”</p>
<p>“No.” I start down the stairs. There’s only one other person besides
Bodhi and Garrick I can trust to prioritize Xaden’s best interests, only
one other person who can know the truth in its entirety. “Tell Glane I
need Imogen.”</p>
<p>I will not die today.</p>
<p>I will save him.</p>
