<h4 id="chapter-twenty-nine">Chapter Twenty-Nine</h4>
<p>It takes ten days to put plans in motion and get everything together,
and the time wears on me like the steady drip of water in the
interrogation chamber, grating on my very last nerve. I sit through
every class as instructed and practice wielding until my arms drop from
exhaustion, but I can’t quit watching Xaden’s eyes in case their flecks
change back to gold whenever I see him during Signet Sparring.</p>
<p>They never do.</p>
<p>By the time most of us have gathered on the flight field in the foggy
predawn hours of the first Saturday of March, my anxiety to get moving
feels like insects under my skin. I hate that we’ve lied to Halden that
this is only the Unnbriel trip, but there’s a growing part of me that
just doesn’t care.</p>
<p>He’s a fucking liability.</p>
<p>After a surprisingly easy discussion with Cat, our squad has grown to
include Trager and Maren—partially because of Trager’s healing training,
but more so we can split if we need to. Given the look on Mira’s face as
those in our squad approach the lines of waiting gryphons and dragons,
she’s not too pleased about the development. Guess I forgot to mention
that part in my missive.</p>
<p>“Where have you been?” I ask, breaking away from the group in hopes
of getting any form of privacy. They quickly disappear into the thick
fog.</p>
<p>“On leave,” she answers. “While you’ve been back here making plans to
disobey direct orders from the Senarium, which of course is your
prerogative as mission commander.” She glances at the oversize pack
currently murdering my spine, then the one sitting at her feet. “The
missives were clever. Subtle, even. The packs? Not so much.”</p>
<p>“The fact that you were on leave was all Panchek would tell me when I
asked how to get a letter to you. You disappeared.” My eyes narrow and I
exhale a puff of steam into the freezing air. “And we can’t help the
size of our packs when we have to carry—”</p>
<p>“Are you worried about not getting enough supplies in Deverelli?”
Halden asks from behind me.</p>
<p>Mira quirks an eyebrow upward, managing to say I told you so without
moving her mouth.</p>
<p>“More worried you’re going to fuck something up again,” Xaden
remarks, and I pivot to see him walking toward us with Garrick out of
the mist.</p>
<p>Halden’s spine stiffens. “You don’t get to talk to me like that,
Riorson.”</p>
<p>“Oh, good. I was wondering when you two would start arguing.” Mira
folds her arms in front of her chest.</p>
<p>“Or you’ll what? Get yourself banned from another isle? Sit off the
coast on Tecarus’s ship? You’re already dead weight, Your Highness. Are
you really going to be a detriment, too?” Xaden stops at my side but
keeps his hands to himself, just like he’s done since he returned.
“Everyone here?”</p>
<p>“Dain is on his way.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to apologize for conducting Navarrian business while
in Deverelli—” Halden starts.</p>
<p>“How about apologizing for keeping mission-essential information from
those of us responsible for the fucking mission?” Xaden counters,
stepping into Halden’s space, shadows swelling around his feet. “If it
wasn’t for us, you’d be dead.”</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>I glance over at Garrick, who looks back at me like I’m the one
supposed to do something.</p>
<p>“Let him kill the prince,” Andarna suggests, and I hear her halter
jingle about twenty feet behind me. “He does not represent us well.”</p>
<p>“He will not be a problem,” Tairn assures us.</p>
<p>If only I felt half as certain.</p>
<p>“Well, we’re off to a great start,” Drake notes, sauntering by on his
way to the line of gryphons, where the other fliers wait in the heavy
fog. I can barely see their shapes from here.</p>
<p>“Get out of my face,” Halden orders.</p>
<p>“Must kill you that you can’t make me.” A corner of Xaden’s mouth
rises. “Why don’t you scurry into your little basket?”</p>
<p>“Fuck off.” Halden’s cheeks redden, but he retreats a single
step.</p>
<p>“I honestly don’t care if you kill him,” I say to Xaden down the
bond, “but you will. Wasn’t that your line when I nearly took off Cat’s
head in Aretia?”</p>
<p>“He’s going to get you killed,” Xaden retorts. “This isn’t going to
work.”</p>
<p>“I’m not dying on Halden’s account.”</p>
<p>Ridoc walks out of the fog from my left, takes one look at Halden and
Xaden, and makes a beeline for my side. “Kind of feels like Threshing,
doesn’t it? Exciting. Terrifying. We know we have to go, but there’s
every chance we’re about to have our asses handed to us.”</p>
<p>“I did not enjoy flying straight through to Athebyne,” Halden
announces into the fog. “We’ll only fly halfway today—”</p>
<p>Fog swirls with the beat of another pair of wings, and the ground
shudders as a dragon lands to the left, just behind Ridoc.</p>
<p>Halden gawks and stumbles backward.</p>
<p>The fog obscures all but the outline of claws until the dragon lowers
his blue snout to ground level and chuffs a deep breath in Halden’s
direction.</p>
<p>What the fuck is Molvic…</p>
<p>My stomach lurches.</p>
<p>“I told you the firstborn would not be an issue,” Tairn reminds
me.</p>
<p>“Molvic?” Ridoc leans forward slightly, like there’s any mistaking
the scar that runs across the Blue Clubtail’s snout.</p>
<p>“No!” I roll my shoulders, drop my pack, and run past Xaden and
Halden, straight into the fog. “Don’t do this!” I make it less than
thirty feet before I find him walking toward us at Dain’s side.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to sit aside and watch while Halden gets you all
killed,” Aaric says, tugging the strap of his rucksack to tighten it.
For Dunne’s sake, he doesn’t even have a battle-ready flight jacket.</p>
<p>“This isn’t what you want,” I remind him. “Don’t let your brother’s
actions force your hand”—I swing a pointing finger at Dain—“and don’t
you let him do it!”</p>
<p>Dain puts both hands up, palms outward at his chest. “How in all
that’s holy am I to blame for this?”</p>
<p>I fumble for an answer. “He’s a first-year and you’re the
wingleader!”</p>
<p>Dain rubs the bridge of his nose and pushes his fingers outward, over
the heavy, dark circles under his eyes. “Vi, I think he outranks me in
this department.”</p>
<p>“You sure you want to do this?” Xaden asks, so close I can suddenly
feel the warmth of him at my back.</p>
<p>“Want? No.” Aaric shakes his head. “But I need to. And as much as I
don’t mind Halden making your life fucking miserable, I do mind him
condemning the Continent to death by dark wielder because he can’t take
a deep breath and count to three when he gets mad.”</p>
<p>“Sounds great to me.” Xaden’s hand brushes the small of my back. “You
good with this?” He glances my way.</p>
<p>I study the set of Aaric’s chin and the determination in his green
eyes, then nod in defeat. “We’re all allowed to make our own choices,
and if this is yours, I’ll support it.”</p>
<p>Aaric nods, and Xaden and I fall into step with him and Dain, heading
for our dragons…and Halden.</p>
<p>“Looks like you won’t be needing that basket after all,” Xaden says
as we make it back to where Mira waits with Ridoc, Garrick, and Halden.
“We found ourselves another prince.”</p>
<p>Halden’s jaw hits the ground as his widened gaze locks on his little
brother.</p>
<p>“Don’t look so surprised,” Aaric says in greeting.</p>
<p>“Don’t look…” Halden shakes his head slowly. “You’ve let us run all
over this kingdom searching brothels and gaming houses for you, and all
the while, you’ve been here?”</p>
<p>“The fact that you went searching your favorite haunts for me is just
the start of where you went wrong,” Aaric replies.</p>
<p>“You’re a rider?” Halden shouts.</p>
<p>“As the dragon would imply.” Ridoc points to Molvic.</p>
<p>“He could have let you think he was dead,” Mira mutters.</p>
<p>“He’s going to be when our father hears—” Halden starts.</p>
<p>“Fuck off and tell him.” Aaric shrugs. “Or don’t. I really don’t
care. I crossed the parapet because I was sick of sitting by knowing you
and Dad weren’t going to do shit about the dark wielders, and I’m not
going to sit by now and watch you run our only hope into the ground.
I’ll be going as the royal representative.”</p>
<p>Halden stiffens. “Absolutely not, Cam.”</p>
<p>“He goes by Aaric, and he absolutely will,” I counter, earning myself
a menacing glare from my ex that doesn’t even faze me. “You’re banned
from Deverelli and have the temper of a two-year-old on a good day,
Halden. Aaric is a rider. He’ll keep up with us in the air and on the
ground, and having been in his squad for the last eight months, I can
promise you that he knows how to keep his shit together when things go
badly.”</p>
<p>Halden’s glare shifts to Aaric. “It was you who breached the royal
vault.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Aaric nods.</p>
<p>“Father blamed me.” Halden takes a step forward, and a tiny twinge of
guilt nips the back of my neck, since our past is most likely the reason
he took the heat. “Did you stay in Basgiath? Or fly with the
rebels?”</p>
<p>“You already know the answer,” Aaric replies.</p>
<p>Halden turns as red as Sliseag. “Go back to the quadrant. I’ll be the
only royal—”</p>
<p>“Good luck getting a gryphon to carry your basket again,” Aaric says,
then walks toward Molvic without another word.</p>
<p>“Well, as awkward as this has been…” Ridoc lifts his brows.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you know your way off the flight field,” Xaden says to
Halden, but the prince’s gaze is locked on the claws of the blue
dragon.</p>
<p>“Violet.” Halden lowers his voice and slowly looks my way. The plea
in his eyes hits me straight in the chest.</p>
<p>“I won’t let anything happen to him,” I promise.</p>
<p>Halden nods once. “I’ll hold you to it.” He looks at each of us in
turn, and the promise morphs into a threat. “All of you.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>We spend a day at Athebyne and another at Cordyn, resting the
gryphons between legs of the journey. They’re far less winded without
the baskets to carry, but without magic to bolster their strength, we
need to take two days to rest in Deverelli before continuing onward.</p>
<p>That second day convinces Mira of what she’d already guessed on our
first trip: some runes work off the Continent. Now to narrow down which
ones and figure out why. We’re each supplied with a handful of
multicolored quartz disks to test. I’m grateful not to be
sunburned—though I can’t tell if it’s the amethyst disk or the same rune
on one of the daggers Xaden gave me last year—but annoyed to all shit
that runes are the only thing Mira is willing to talk to me about.</p>
<p>The southwestern Deverelli coastline falls away in the early hours of
the eighth day of the trip, and the color shifts from aqua to midnight
blue as we head over the open sea.</p>
<p>And that’s all I see on the horizon—water.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for ships beneath us making their own journeys, I’d be
more than a little apprehensive about flying into nothingness.</p>
<p>“Save your nerves for when we reach Unnbriel in nine hours,” Tairn
tells me. “And save yours for when the winds shift,” he instructs
Andarna, who’s clipped in below.</p>
<p>Gods, I hope the maps my father included are accurate. Dragons aren’t
exactly boats. They can’t just float if they get tired, and nine hours
from now will put our total flight time at twelve.</p>
<p>Gryphons aren’t fond of anything over eight.</p>
<p>The air current shifts sometime around noon, giving us a tailwind as
the clouds clear, and Andarna relishes in her freedom unclipped from
Tairn, off to his side. Her wingbeats are strong, but the difference in
her left wing is far more visible without magic for strength. Each beat
strains the tendons to gain full extension, and it isn’t long before
she’s dipping slightly.</p>
<p>Worry wraps her prickly fingers around my throat when Andarna pitches
in a gust, but I keep my mouth shut as she climbs back into
formation.</p>
<p>“Do not lose altitude,” Tairn warns her. “There is no telling what
weaponry arms the merchant vessels beneath us.”</p>
<p>“Do you ever tire of your own voice?” she questions, soaring a little
closer to Sgaeyl.</p>
<p>“Never,” he assures her.</p>
<p>With nothing to do for the next eight hours but hold on, I listen as
Tairn recites the lore of his breed from the first of his line up to
Thareux, the first black dragon to ever successfully bond, back during
the Great War, then stops.</p>
<p>Apparently the story is no longer worth telling once humans are
involved.</p>
<p>The sun has slid into the angles of afternoon by the time Tairn
catches sight of land.</p>
<p>“Thirty minutes!” he announces to Andarna and me, then lets loose a
roar that vibrates my teeth to alert the others.</p>
<p>I pivot in the saddle to check our formation. Everyone is where they
should be, with the exception of Kiralair, who is drifting back from her
guarded position in the center, toward Aotrom’s snout. “Just in time,
too. Kiralair is fading.”</p>
<p>“Had to bring the gryphons,” Tairn mutters as I turn forward again
and the hilly coastline comes into view.</p>
<p>The sea transitions from dark blue to white-capped teal crashing on
cream-colored beaches along what appears to be a port city a few miles
in front of us.</p>
<p>“That must be Soneram.” We’ve definitely found the isle of Dunne. I
can make out the tiered walls of defenses—including cross-bolts—from
here, and they haven’t changed much from what my father detailed in his
drawings. “Let’s avoid being skewered, shall we?” I ask Tairn.</p>
<p>Tairn huffs and surges ahead of the others, then banks right and
leads our formation along the northeastern shoreline, giving the port
city a wide berth.</p>
<p>I block the afternoon sun with a hand on my forehead and scan the
coast, noting the end of the city walls. “There’s another town in two or
three miles, then nothing for at least forty.”</p>
<p>As long as they haven’t expanded in the thirty-plus years since my
father wrote his book.</p>
<p>We pass the town and its substantial fortifications, and after we
travel another ten minutes without sight of habitation, Tairn turns
inland, breaking formation and flying ahead of the others.</p>
<p>“Stay with Sgaeyl,” he orders Andarna.</p>
<p>Andarna huffs in annoyance.</p>
<p>“Stick to the plan,” I remind her.</p>
<p>“I loathe the plan,” she replies.</p>
<p>The beaches are rockier here, the narrow strip of sand strewn with
boulders before it gives way to hills of thick vegetation that roll as
far as I can see.</p>
<p>All of it is the same muted green as Deverelli.</p>
<p>“That one,” Tairn says, locating a suitably large clearing about
halfway up a hillside a few miles inland from the coast, and after a
perimeter sweep, we finally land in the dead center of the meadow.</p>
<p>Birds launch from the trees in a riot of color, quickly fleeing.</p>
<p>A low rumble resonates through Tairn, not quite powerful enough to be
a growl but definitely loud enough to warn anything that might consider
making us dinner as he slowly rotates, scanning the edges of the trees
and sweeping his tail through the waist-high grass.</p>
<p>“This will do,” he says once he’s completed a turn.</p>
<p>Moments later, the rest appear overhead, Sgaeyl leading formation.
Their wings cast shade over the clearing momentarily, flaring to slow
their descent before they land around us.</p>
<p>The ground shudders as they make impact, Andarna to the right and
Sgaeyl to our left. Teine, Aotrom, Cath, Chradh, and Molvic touch down
behind us, and the gryphons fill in the spaces as we form a large
circle.</p>
<p>Every set of teeth and talons faces the trees.</p>
<p>“Hear that?” Tairn lowers his head and stalks forward.</p>
<p>The jungle around us is unnaturally silent. “The animals here
recognize you as predators, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>“Good.” He dips his shoulder and I start the process of dismounting,
leaving all but the essentials strapped behind the seat of my
saddle.</p>
<p>Everyone strips down to our undershirts—or in my case, my armor—to
accommodate the suffocating heat and humidity that rivals Deverelli, and
then we make quick work of securing the site and locating a nearby
stream for fresh water. Then Cat and Trager take off into the woods to
hunt while half the riot launches to do the same.</p>
<p>“We’re alone for now, but we won’t be for long,” Mira says as Teine
follows Tairn and Aotrom into the sky. “Someone will see them.”</p>
<p>“Good. Once Aaric meets with their queen, we can move on.” I skim my
hand over the pale green meadow grass and pick up a sizable rock to line
the firepit with. “Chances of an alliance here are slim. Given how
painful it is for the riot to be separated from magic, I doubt Andarna’s
kind settled here.”</p>
<p>“What if they learned to live without magic?” Mira asks, rotating a
beaded bracelet of what looks like black tourmaline on her wrist and
watching Ridoc and Garrick build a fire as Dain constructs a cooking
spit with Maren and Aaric.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if they can,” I admit softly, my eye catching on the
bracelet. Something about the knotwork holding the metallic beads
tickles the back of my brain, and I swear I can smell parchment for the
smallest of seconds before I look away. “Tairn isn’t exactly offering up
details on how it affects their lifespan.”</p>
<p>“Are he and Sgaeyl having some kind of mate drama?” Mira picks up a
rock of her own.</p>
<p>“Not that I know of. Why?” I ask, and we start back toward the center
of the clearing.</p>
<p>“They haven’t hunted together the entire trip.” She tucks her stone
under her arm and picks up another.</p>
<p>I glance across the field, where Xaden walks patrol with Drake near
Sgaeyl and Andarna. “They think one of them should always be with the
group.” It’s as close to the truth as I’m going to get with her.</p>
<p>She glances at me like she can see right through the half truth.</p>
<p>Cue change of subject.</p>
<p>“Where did you go on leave?” I ask her.</p>
<p>Her mouth purses, like she’s deciding. “I went to see
Grandmother.”</p>
<p>“You flew to Deaconshire?” I mean, that’s a choice, I guess.</p>
<p>“You think I took personal leave to visit a burial ground?” She
side-eyes me.</p>
<p>My eyebrows try their damnedest to reach my hairline. “You went to
see Grandma Niara?” I end on a whisper.</p>
<p>Mira rolls her eyes. “You don’t have to whisper. Our parents can’t
hear you.”</p>
<p>I’m tempted to check our surroundings just to be sure. “She stopped
talking to Mom and Dad…” I shake my head. “It must have been before I
was born because I don’t even remember her. Something to do with Dad
marrying Mom, right?”</p>
<p>Mira shakes her head. “You were a toddler,” she says. “Right around
the age where your hair was coming in thick enough to pull into a little
ponytail.” She smiles at the memory, but it slips. “And it wasn’t
Grandma Niara who ended communication. Turns out it was the other way
around.”</p>
<p>“You know what happened, don’t you?” Envy stabs quick and deep. Mom
and Dad almost never spoke of his family. Is that where the bracelet
came from?</p>
<p>“You should go up to Luceras.” She looks at me with the oddest
combination of worry and dread, her mouth tightening. “Talk to her
yourself.”</p>
<p>“With all the leave I get before graduation?”</p>
<p>“Excellent point.” She scours the field for another rock.</p>
<p>Just not excellent enough for her to tell me. Fine. If the last year
has taught me anything, it’s that we’re all entitled to our secrets. But
it’s my family, too.</p>
<p>“I brought Dad’s books in case you want to read them.” I offer
another subject change and start looking for firepit rocks again. The
ground is firm below our feet, so at least we won’t be sleeping in
mud.</p>
<p>Mira’s brow knits.</p>
<p>“They mostly cover customs,” I blurt. “But he devotes an entire
chapter in every book to the unique flora and fauna of every isle. Very
thorough.” My own forehead puckers. I’m babbling, but I can’t help
trying to find something that bridges the space I can feel expanding
between us. “Did Grandma Niara say how he found time to study things
like the migratory patterns of terns and errisbirds? Or Fallorinia
moths? He spends three pages talking about companion planting breeson
root and kellenweed, then goes off about zakia berries and how if the
birds migrate to Hedotis too late, they’re overripe and the flock drops
dead, their little yellow beaks stained blue.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, but no. That sounds awful.” She stiffens and shifts so
both rocks are in her arms.</p>
<p>I clutch my rock. “Did Grandma Niara know he studied the isles?”</p>
<p>Her lips part, but then she looks away. “She knew. And he left the
books for you alone, remember? I certainly don’t need to know about bird
migration or moths.”</p>
<p>“Mira—” Fuck.</p>
<p>She quickens her pace, leaving me behind, and I blow out a slow
sigh.</p>
<p>“That was embarrassing to listen to. Could you make it any more
awkward?” Andarna chides.</p>
<p>“Go hunt something.”</p>
<p>We set up camp with one eye on the forest at all times, cooking the
rabbits Trager and Cat bring back, laying out bedrolls around the fire,
and assigning watches before getting to sleep, encircled by two dragons
and a matching number of gryphons at all times while the others
accompany their riders and fliers on watch.</p>
<p>I take first with Maren and Drake, who I learn has a sarcastic sense
of humor to rival Ridoc’s.</p>
<p>Xaden takes second with Mira and Garrick.</p>
<p>The stars shine bright when Xaden finally slides under the blankets,
fully clothed all the way to his boots just like I am. He wraps his arm
around my waist, then tugs my back against his chest. I smile, half
asleep, then burrow closer. Wood crashes, and I blink my eyes open as
Dain throws another piece of timber onto the dying blaze, stoking the
fire.</p>
<p>“Anything?” I whisper.</p>
<p>“Not yet,” Xaden says against my ear, curling his body around mine,
and any chill he’s picked up on patrol is quickly warmed away. “They
have to go.”</p>
<p>I nod and fight the dread taking root in my stomach. Being bait
settles like curdled milk.</p>
<p>He presses a kiss behind my ear, and his breathing evens out behind
me.</p>
<p>“Wait for sunrise to disappear,” I tell Tairn, already sinking into
sleep. “He needs as much rest as we can give him.” Unnbriel is all about
trial by combat, and he’s the best among us.</p>
<p>Tairn grumbles his assent.</p>
<p>“Rise!” Tairn shouts what feels like an instant later, and my eyes
spring open to see a line of pink and orange gracing the horizon.</p>
<p>I suck in a startled breath, and Xaden’s hand splays over my hip,
holding me in place. Grass rustles rhythmically behind us, and my heart
starts to pound. This would be a great time to access that bond we
share. My right hand fists the blankets that cover us, and Xaden’s hand
slips to my upper thigh sheath.</p>
<p>“It was a mistake to come,” a man says in the common language, his
voice low as he leans over us. “Your magic won’t help you here,
fire-bringer.”</p>
<p>I rip back the blankets and Xaden draws my dagger, bringing it to the
edge of the man’s throat in a single smooth motion.</p>
<p>The soldier’s brown eyes widen as I palm my next dagger and glance
over his leather armor, spotting the weak joints at his elbows and
beneath his arms. It’s been dyed the same pale green as the leaves on
the trees, and an emblem of two crossed swords over a horseshoe is
stamped across his chest plate.</p>
<p>“That’s fine.” Xaden sits up slowly, keeping the dagger’s edge at the
base of the soldier’s throat as he retreats. “We brought blades.”</p>
<p>It is unwise to favor one god above another. Better to shun them all
than show favoritism amongst a jealous, prodigious pantheon.</p>
