<h4 id="chapter-fifty-nine">Chapter Fifty-Nine</h4>
<p>“Mira!” I scream louder than a dragon’s roar as crimson blood streams
from the laceration in my sister’s throat.</p>
<p>Everything seems to happen at once, like a group of musicians cued
for a performance.</p>
<p>“Time to play, Violet.” Theophanie hurls the dagger—at Jack.</p>
<p>A sea of gray wings rises in the south, and my boots pound across the
field.</p>
<p>Xaden projects a stream of shadow toward Theophanie, but the bands
fly southward.</p>
<p>What the fuck? No time to think. I’m already running at the dark
wielder, alloy-hilted dagger drawn, when the closest wyvern launches and
plucks Theophanie from the ground as it flies overhead.</p>
<p>Mira collapses to her knees in the grass, grabbing for the fatal cut
with both hands, and suddenly nothing else matters. Not revenge. Not
Draithus. My sister only has seconds.</p>
<p>Malek, please, no.</p>
<p>“It’s all right.” My voice breaks, and I discard my dagger and hit
the ground, catching her as she falls. Blood streams through my fingers
as I press my hand against the pulsing wound at her throat. Pressure.
She needs pressure.</p>
<p>Not Mira. I yell at whatever deity will listen and press harder, like
I can force the blood back into her body. My breath comes in stuttered
gasps, terror cutting off the flow of oxygen.</p>
<p>Mira stares up at me, her brown eyes wide with shock, and I force a
smile so she doesn’t meet Malek in fear. “You’re going to be all right.”
I nod, my head jerking as my eyes blur.</p>
<p>“Move!” Brennan hits his knees, and I barely have time to yank my
hand away before his is there. “You will live, do you hear me?” He slams
his eyes shut and sweat immediately beads on his forehead as he leans
over Mira.</p>
<p>Is it even possible? Brennan’s powerful, but I can’t think of a
single rider who’s been saved on the battlefield with an injury this
extensive. She goes limp and my heart seizes, but she’s still breathing
despite the blood coursing down the sides of her neck.</p>
<p>Shapes blur and snarls sound from every direction. I look up, and the
dragons leap over us, claws filling the sky before they land on the
circle of wyvern. Four of the gray creatures launch at the onslaught,
shrieking their way into the sky. The daggers of Sgaeyl’s tail swing
just a few feet above us, and I throw my body over Mira and Brennan as
the navy-blue blades cut so close I can feel air rush against my
skin.</p>
<p>Xaden casts a wall of shadow, blocking us from the fray, and to the
right, I see Garrick pull the venin’s dagger from the door of the
Rybestad chest as Bodhi forces the other one shut.</p>
<p>Screeches fill the air and my muscles lock as I look back over my
shoulder at the impenetrable darkness. “Tairn!” I can’t see him.</p>
<p>“They die,” he says, fury saturating the bond.</p>
<p>I take that as the only good sign on this field and sit back on my
heels, giving Brennan room to breathe.</p>
<p>“Come on, come on,” Brennan mutters, his brow furrowed in
concentration just like Dad’s used to, but he’s swaying slightly and
losing color in his face.</p>
<p>It has to work. It just has to.</p>
<p>Blood trickles down the column of Mira’s neck, crossing her scar as
her eyes flutter shut.</p>
<p>“You can’t have her,” I whisper up to Malek, and I swear the clouds
darken slightly in acknowledgment, or maybe mocking, as two reds
approach from the south at tremendous speed.</p>
<p>Wait. Why are they flying away from the city?</p>
<p>I strain to identify the dragons. Thoirt? The tear pattern in her
right wing is unmistakable, but that would mean…</p>
<p>Oh gods, Sloane is here.</p>
<p>Liam, I’m so sorry. My throat tries to close as I throw my head back
and search the sky for gray, but there’s only Thoirt and— I blink.
That’s Cath on her tail.</p>
<p>Sweat drips down Brennan’s neck at the same alarmingly fast pace as
blood from Mira’s wound, and his breathing becomes labored. “There’s too
much damage,” he whispers.</p>
<p>“There isn’t,” I argue, glancing between Mira’s slackened face and
the strain on my brother’s. “Brennan, you can mend anything,
remember?”</p>
<p>Marbh roars.</p>
<p>“Your brother nears the limit of his power,” Tairn warns.</p>
<p>And I can’t give him mine. My heart races.</p>
<p>“Get the chest out of here,” Xaden shouts to Garrick. “If she wanted
him dead, he obviously knows things they don’t want us to.”</p>
<p>“Chradh!” Garrick yells, and the Brown Scorpiontail bounds over the
shadows to Garrick’s side. A second later, they disappear, along with
the trunk.</p>
<p>I feel a rush of air as they go, and glance toward the sky as the two
reds approach.</p>
<p>“How much are we trusting Aetos these days?” Bodhi says as he runs
toward us.</p>
<p>“Not enough for what he just saw,” Xaden answers, his shadows
blocking what looks to be the tip of a wyvern’s tail from hitting
me.</p>
<p>Wind from wingbeats blows back Brennan’s hair, and the reds land so
close their heads hover over us as they skid to a halt, their talons
dragging up clumps of grass.</p>
<p>“Violet, I’m sorry,” Brennan whispers.</p>
<p>“Don’t say that.” I shake my head. “The blood flow is slowing. It’s
working.” Though it hasn’t stopped.</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you doing here?” Xaden calls up at Dain as he
dismounts, but my focus firmly locks over Brennan’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Following her ass,” Dain replies, then winces at the crunch of bone
coming from behind the wall of shadows Xaden holds in place with both
hands. “She’s under my command, and Cath alerted me the second they
crossed the wards against orders.” He aims that last part in Sloane’s
direction.</p>
<p>Sloane. A shard of hope pierces the terror wrapped around my
heart.</p>
<p>She races our way, reaching into her flight jacket and retrieving a
cylindrical parcel the length of her hand. “Aaric told me you’d need
this—” She stumbles as she catches sight of Mira.</p>
<p>I don’t give a shit why she’s here. Only that she is.</p>
<p>My eyes prickle. “Please.”</p>
<p>Sloane’s fearful gaze snaps to mine.</p>
<p>“Mira?” Dain runs, then drops to a knee beside me. “Oh shit.”</p>
<p>“Please,” I blatantly, shamelessly beg Sloane. “Brennan needs more
power, and we’re going to lose her.”</p>
<p>She takes one tentative step, then another as Brennan trembles, his
hands on Mira’s neck. “I don’t know how. When your m—” She stops
herself. “Transferring is different than imbuing. I know that much.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you’re going to do, you’d better do it fast,” Bodhi warns,
drawing a sword and standing guard, his eyes on the sky.</p>
<p>“Try,” Dain urges, shoving the sleeve of his uniform up his forearm.
“It’s dangerous to use your own power if you haven’t trained, so take
mine. I’m the only one here who doesn’t have to wield today. Just
try.”</p>
<p>A wyvern snarls behind me, and a distinctive snap follows.</p>
<p>Sloane lowers herself between Dain and Brennan as Mira’s blood soaks
into my leathers.</p>
<p>“One hand on my wrist,” Dain says gently, like he’s talking to a
skittish horse.</p>
<p>She stares at the gray handprint that scars his forearm. “I don’t
want to do that. Become that.”</p>
<p>“You won’t.” He lifts his brows. “You can hate me later, but trust me
now or she dies.”</p>
<p>Sloane wraps her fingers around Dain’s wrist. Her eyes flare, and she
swallows. “Someone like you shouldn’t have this much power.”</p>
<p>“Good thing for Mira I do. Put the other hand anywhere his skin is
exposed,” he orders.</p>
<p>Sloane drops her little package and lifts her hand to the back of
Brennan’s neck.</p>
<p>I brush Mira’s hair off her forehead, leaving a bloody smear behind.
She’s so damned pale. I should have told her about Xaden. She should
have told me about my dedication. We’ve wasted so much time keeping
things from each other, when Dad warned me to only trust her. If I had,
would this still have happened?</p>
<p>“Do not blame yourself for wounds you do not inflict,” Tairn
lectures.</p>
<p>“Eyes here,” Dain says, and Sloane looks his way. “Pull from the
excess you feel in me, and push to the deficit in him. You’re not a
weapon of destruction. You’re not venin. You’re the artery power chooses
to flow through. You’re life.”</p>
<p>Her brow knits, and Dain flinches. “I’m going to hurt you.”</p>
<p>“Gods, don’t I know it.” He nods. “But you’re not going to kill me,
no matter how badly you want to. Now do it.”</p>
<p>Her mouth tightens, and Dain grits his teeth.</p>
<p>Precious, long seconds pass before Brennan breathes deeply and color
flushes his cheeks. I glance back to Mira, expecting the worst, but her
chest still rises and falls. Blood ceases to drip, color returning to
her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Brennan?” I whisper, too scared to even hope.</p>
<p>“It’s messy, but she’s alive.” My brother sits back, his frame
drooping as he drags the back of his arm over his sweaty brow. “Thank
you, Mairi.”</p>
<p>She lets go of both men, then lifts her gaze to mine. “She’ll be all
right?”</p>
<p>“Thanks to you,” I say to Sloane.</p>
<p>She blows out a swift sigh of relief as Brennan reaches for the
waterskin clipped at his hip. He quickly uncorks the top, then pours the
water over Mira’s neck. A thick, angry pink scar straddles her
throat.</p>
<p>I push her hair off her forehead again and give myself exactly three
seconds to feel everything. My chest threatens to explode.</p>
<p>One. She’s alive.</p>
<p>Two. I won’t have to navigate a world where she doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Three. Brennan is a fucking miracle worker.</p>
<p>“We have to get Mira out of here,” I say to my brother as the snarls
and sounds of tearing flesh diminish behind me. A shape comes flying
overhead but is yanked back by a rope of shadow. Pretty sure it was a
talon.</p>
<p>“Agreed.” Brennan looks toward Draithus, where an outright battle has
begun. Dragons and gryphons hover above the city walls as enormous
cross-bolts fire into the cloud of approaching wyvern. “You all right,
Aetos?”</p>
<p>Dain twists his hand around his wrist. “I’m good.”</p>
<p>My stomach clenches. The hardest part of this will be trusting
everyone to do their jobs, and the city isn’t mine to hold. I glance at
Xaden, then Dain. “You both have to go. They’ll be out of cross-bolts
soon.”</p>
<p>Dain rises to stand and offers his hand to Sloane.</p>
<p>“Fuck off, Aetos.” She rocks forward and up to her feet.</p>
<p>He pauses like he’s counting to three. “Get back across the wards,
Mairi, and stay there.”</p>
<p>She turns on her heel and stalks toward Thoirt, lifting a middle
finger.</p>
<p>Bodhi snorts.</p>
<p>“Fucking first-years,” Dain mutters as she mounts. “Riorson, I’ll
meet you down there.” He heads toward Cath’s foreleg.</p>
<p>“Dain!” I shout, and he looks back over his shoulder. “Thank
you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t thank me. Just tell me later how the fuck Garrick and Chradh
disappeared into thin air.” He takes off at a run, and within a matter
of seconds, both Thoirt and Cath fly in separate directions.</p>
<p>Bodhi helps Brennan to his feet.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to leave you.” Xaden drops the wall of shadow. I glance
over my shoulder and find dead wyvern scattered in the field, and
Sgaeyl, Tairn, and Marbh examining the chains strapped around Teine.</p>
<p>“I know. But you have to.”</p>
<p>“I’ll carry her.” Brennan bends and scoops Mira’s unconscious body
off my lap.</p>
<p>“You’re all right?” I locate my alloy-hilted dagger in the grass and
put it back in place as I rise, then grab the package Sloane left
behind, too. It’s addressed to Aaric and bears the unbroken seal of
Dunne.</p>
<p>Why in all that’s holy would he send Sloane into a war zone to give
me his own mail? I’m going to throttle him…as soon as I figure out what
the fuck he’s currently doing.</p>
<p>“Mairi gave me a little more than she needed to. I’m fine.” He
adjusts Mira in his arms.</p>
<p>“I know you were supposed to stay, but take Mira,” Bodhi says. “We’ll
figure out how to free Teine so she can follow.”</p>
<p>“Agreed.” Brennan’s mouth tenses, and he looks at me. “I have more
than a dozen runes I can leave—”</p>
<p>“Thanks, but I’ll pass,” I interrupt. “Better I stick to what I’m
good at.”</p>
<p>He nods. “Stick to the plan, Violet—no matter what goes wrong. We’re
counting on you.” His gaze jumps to Xaden. “That applies to you, too.”
He doesn’t waste time waiting for a reply, just heads toward Marbh.</p>
<p>I slip Aaric’s package into my flight jacket pocket and watch as
Brennan walks away. Weird. There’s no mark at the back of his neck like
he carries on his palm. There hadn’t been one on Dain’s wrist,
either.</p>
<p>“You’d better go,” Bodhi urges Xaden. “We’ve got wyvern trying to
round the north side of the city, and the pass is just beyond. Whole
battle just a few miles away, remember?”</p>
<p>“I’m going.” Xaden grabs Brennan’s discarded waterskin, then pours
its remaining contents over my right hand, washing away the majority of
Mira’s blood. The water runs off my fingers, slowly fading from crimson
to pale pink before he drops the skin. “Concentrate.” He cradles my
cheek, and our eyes lock. “Use only Tairn’s power. Do not turn. Do not
die. Accomplish your mission, and I will find you after.”</p>
<p>He kisses me breathless, and for just that second, time doesn’t
matter. My heart races, and I wrap my arms around his neck, pouring
everything I feel for him into my response. It’s chaotic and desperate
and over far too soon.</p>
<p>“Come back to me,” I demand as he moves away.</p>
<p>“Only ever you.” He holds my gaze for another few steps, then turns
to Bodhi. “Stay with her, but remember your promise.”</p>
<p>Bodhi nods. “I don’t want your fucking province.”</p>
<p>“Noted.” Xaden clasps Bodhi’s shoulder, then breaks into a run for
Sgaeyl. Her golden eyes swivel toward mine.</p>
<p>“Get off the ground and stay with him,” she orders, and we both know
she doesn’t mean Bodhi.</p>
<p>“Same goes to you.” I lift my chin.</p>
<p>They’re airborne within seconds, flying south toward the city. I look
away before fear has a chance to grab hold. He’s the most powerful rider
on the field, and she’s merciless. Their survival isn’t a question.</p>
<p>Bodhi and I will give them enough time to save the city.</p>
<p>“Now that the Duke of Angst is gone,” Bodhi says, his voice rising,
“we have a problem.”</p>
<p>Of course we do.</p>
<p>The only thing more stubborn than a dragon is its rider.</p>
