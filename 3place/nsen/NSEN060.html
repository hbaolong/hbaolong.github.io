<h4 id="chapter-fifty-eight">Chapter Fifty-Eight</h4>
<p>Tairn can fly to the nearest edge of the Cliffs of Dralor in two
hours, but it does us no good to leave Sgaeyl, Cuir, and Marbh behind,
so by the time we reach the ten-thousand-foot drop, we’re cutting it
close to Theophanie’s deadline.</p>
<p>Gods, if we miss it, if we’re too late and she kills Mira—</p>
<p>My throat threatens to close.</p>
<p>“We’ll make it,” Tairn promises as we descend the cliffs in a steep
dive between the falls and the crowded Medaro Pass. It had been a
treacherous, deadly climb in autumn, and we were cadets. I can’t begin
to imagine how civilians—how children—are making the ascent.</p>
<p>“Do you agree that it’s a trap?” The words spill out before I can
stop them.</p>
<p>“Of course,” he replies. “But you already know that. Otherwise, we
would have discussed it over the last three and a half hours.”</p>
<p>Guilt wedges itself between my ribs as we plunge into a thick layer
of fluffy white clouds.</p>
<p>“Do not dishonor me with such emotions,” he lectures.</p>
<p>“And how does Sgaeyl feel about me endangering Xaden?” I scan the
clouds as best I can for the outline of wyvern, but the cover is thick
and we’re moving too fast to be thorough.</p>
<p>“Had she not agreed, she would still be in Aretia, and your Dark One
would be walking.”</p>
<p>Excellent point. “Theophanie took Mira because of me. I’m the reason
she’s going through this.”</p>
<p>“You are our lightning wielder, and while your life may not matter
more than other riders’, your signet does. You are the weapon and will
have to learn to accept the sacrifice of others in your name if you want
to win this war.”</p>
<p>Nausea churns in my stomach.</p>
<p>“And you think I should have accepted Mira’s death as a sacrifice?”
We burst through the clouds, and the field comes into startling
view.</p>
<p>“If I did, I would still be in Aretia and you would be walking.”</p>
<p>My heart sinks as I survey the landscape. The eastern fields
approaching Draithus are covered in hordes of gray wyvern, setting siege
against a line of dragons and gryphons perched between the guard stands
along the city walls. They outnumber us in a ratio I don’t even want to
calculate. For the first time, I’m relieved that Andarna chose to go.
Brennan is brilliant, but this feels unwinnable. “Our estimates were
off.”</p>
<p>“It appears so.”</p>
<p>But none of them launch to attack as we descend, nor do they impede
the thick line of evacuees streaming from the city’s western gate.</p>
<p>“Molvic has been spotted along the cliffs,” Tairn warns as he flares
his wings, slowing our momentum.</p>
<p>Fucking Aaric. “If he gets himself killed—”</p>
<p>“He was seen flying south, away from conflict.” He spits every word
in disgust.</p>
<p>What in Amari’s name could he be doing? “It’s not like Aaric to run
away.”</p>
<p>“Nor Molvic.” Tairn levels out as we approach the northern field,
where at last I spot a horde of a dozen wyvern waiting in a circle
around Teine.</p>
<p>In. Out. I force myself to breathe. It’s unnatural to hold a
dragon…captive.</p>
<p>The wyvern are perched on heavy chains that loop around Teine’s tail,
bind his legs and his snout, and pin his wings to his thrashing body.
Each line of metal is coated in his blood, and several of his scales
litter the ground.</p>
<p>Theophanie stands in front of them, silver hair shining, holding one
blade to Mira’s throat and another against her ribs.</p>
<p>My grip tightens on the pommels, and I can’t tell if it’s Tairn’s
rage or my own stampeding through my veins, but it tramples every last
ounce of my fear, my doubt, and my guilt until I am nothing but
wrath.</p>
<p>How fucking dare she.</p>
<p>“She dies for this,” Tairn demands, his impact rustling the green
meadow grass as we land twenty feet in front of Theophanie, who welcomes
us with a smile.</p>
<p>She hasn’t drained the field…yet, but she has beaten the shit out of
my sister. The right side of Mira’s face is purple and swollen, her
throat carries a necklace of bruises, and blood drips from her left
hand, but her leathers hide its origin. Theophanie’s scarlet
long-sleeved tunic and pants aren’t helping with contrast, either.</p>
<p>“Agreed. Can you carry Teine if he can’t fly?” I unbuckle from my
saddle as the others land on either side of Tairn.</p>
<p>“Not without sinking my claws into him.” He growls low in his throat.
“Spend no more time on the ground than necessary.”</p>
<p>“I’ll stick to the plan.” Leaving my bag strapped behind Tairn, I
adjust the leather-capped quiver and holstered crossbow at my back,
check to make sure my conduit is tucked safely in my pocket, then
dismount.</p>
<p>All Theophanie has to do is set her hand to the ground, and we’re all
dead.</p>
<p>“I’m here, just like you wanted.” I hold out my arms, and power rises
within me, heating my flight-chilled skin. Out of the corner of my eye,
I see Brennan approach from the left, while Xaden and Bodhi walk in at
my right.</p>
<p>“So you are.” The wind whips Theophanie’s long, silver braid as her
smile cracks her chapped lips, and my gaze catches on the pulsing veins
at her temples and faded remnants of the tattoo on her forehead. “And
yet, you seem to have lost your irid. How inconvenient.”</p>
<p>“No,” Mira garbles, and Theophanie tightens her gnarled grip on the
blade, pressing it harder against Mira’s throat. Another ounce of
pressure and her skin will split.</p>
<p>“Shhh. Speak again, and I’ll spill your dragon’s blood all over this
field,” Theophanie says into Mira’s ear as the others reach me.</p>
<p>My sister stills as the men reach my sides.</p>
<p>“Let them go.” I will slaughter the dark wielder where she stands.
Energy hums in my veins, ready for the first opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>“Stay calm,” Xaden says, shadows curling over the toes of his boots
and drifting south as we start to walk closer. “Stay in control.” He
glances toward the doomed city.</p>
<p>Keeping the promise I made to Brennan means not looking, so I
don’t.</p>
<p>“That’s usually my line.” I keep my eyes off Mira, focusing solely on
the dark wielder.</p>
<p>“Not yet. And four on one hardly seems fair.” Theophanie glances at
Brennan, then Bodhi. “I didn’t ask for either of you to attend.”</p>
<p>“I thought you requested brothers? Next time be more specific about
who’s invited,” I suggest.</p>
<p>“And yet you didn’t bring the brother he wanted.” Theophanie sighs.
“Berwyn will be disappointed.” A thin line of blood appears along the
edge of her knife.</p>
<p>“He’s on the way,” I say quickly.</p>
<p>“Berwyn.” Xaden tenses, and his focus swings south toward the city
again. That’s where he needs to be—in position to save as many people as
possible—but he’s made it clear he doesn’t want to leave me.</p>
<p>“Yes. Hence the term brother.” Theophanie glances my way. “I won’t
make the mistakes with you Berwyn made with Jack. He spills his Sage’s
secrets too easily.”</p>
<p>“I’m not turning.” My hands curl into fists.</p>
<p>“You are,” she states like it’s certain. “In just a few minutes, in
fact. I’m intrigued to see what the actual catalyst will be.” Her eyes
light up. “Saving your sister? Defending your lover? The
trite-yet-always-popular revenge? I’m betting on a combination of all
three.” Her head tilts, and she rests her cheek against the top of
Mira’s head. “Speaking of which, time is up—”</p>
<p>My heart lurches, and a gust of wind blows from the north.</p>
<p>“He’s here!” Garrick shouts.</p>
<p>I glance left and find Chradh standing where there had only been
empty space moments before, his foreclaw clutching a familiar runed
armoire. They made it, but the knife still at Mira’s throat makes it
hard to feel any sort of relief.</p>
<p>“Show him to me,” Theophanie orders.</p>
<p>Xaden rolls his neck, and the shadows around his feet drift past
Bodhi’s.</p>
<p>Garrick dismounts, then walks to the Rybestad chest with slower steps
than usual and pulls the key from his pocket. It only takes a few
seconds for him to open the chest’s doors.</p>
<p>“There he is.” Theophanie smiles, but I don’t risk taking my eyes off
her to examine how Jack is doing, especially not when Mira looks like
she might pass out at any second. “Just one little matter of business to
attend to, and then we’ll begin.”</p>
<p>“He is emaciated and wan,” Tairn tells me. “Suspended in air as the
chest intends, and he appears…sedated. I can show you through my eyes if
you prefer—”</p>
<p>“Description is perfect, thank you.” I lift my chin. “Both Jack and I
are here. Our end of the deal is fulfilled, so let Mira and Teine
go.”</p>
<p>Brennan’s hands flex at his sides.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t the deal.” Theophanie tsks. “I said we’d let Draithus
stand, not that your sister would live.” Her mouth curves in a sadistic
smile. “First thing to learn about us is that we’re careful with our
words. And the second? We also lie.”</p>
<p>She draws the blade across Mira’s neck and slits her throat.</p>
<p>It was not without risk that the first dragons bonded humans, for
though they clearly hold the power, their bonded riders made them the
one thing they could not tolerate: vulnerable. Many dragons suffered the
loss of their bonded riders in the name</p>
<p>of self-preservation.</p>
