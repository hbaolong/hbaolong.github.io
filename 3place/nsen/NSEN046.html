<h4 id="chapter-forty-four">Chapter Forty-Four</h4>
<p>Leadership separates us completely after we put our things in our
rooms, then questions us for twelve hours each with scribes. When Aetos
accidentally lets slip his annoyance that King Tauri is so grateful to
have Aaric back that he’s forbidden any form of punishment, the
emotional relief results in an immediate sense of overwhelming
exhaustion, but I don’t ask for a reprieve from the endless debrief. I
made the decisions, and if this prolonged interrogation is my only
collegiate repercussion, I’ll take it without complaint, especially
knowing the other members of the squad are safe, too.</p>
<p>They go over the trip’s details so many times, for so many hours,
that I start to worry if they’re looking for holes in our stories or if
they suspect we had more than rare texts to guide us. It’s tedious and
exhausting, but at least I get to see Markham’s face twist with jealousy
from across the room on the few occasions he sits in on my sessions.</p>
<p>I’ve seen things he never will, touched pieces of history he didn’t
know existed.</p>
<p>Just like my father.</p>
<p>Mira and Garrick are released back to the front on March
twenty-eighth, the last day of our inquisition. Drake departs for
Cordyn. Brennan arrives from Aretia to mend my ribs. Xaden is hauled
into Senarium meetings while being returned to his position as a
professor.</p>
<p>And the rest of us go back to class.</p>
<p>For having missed more than three weeks, I’m only completely lost in
physics and mildly confused in history, since all my studying prior to
the trip had nothing to do with Braevick absorbing Cygnisen under Porom
the First. If not for Rhi’s notes, the three of us would drown
academically, and I’m sure Aaric feels the same about Sloane.</p>
<p>But it’s Battle Brief on our first day back that shows just how much
damage can be done in three weeks. Suniva is far from the only city to
have fallen. In fact, geographically speaking, it’s an outlier.</p>
<p>“That’s not possible,” I whisper, staring at the map from my seat.
How many dark wielders would it take to cover that much territory this
quickly? Rhi and I spent the early morning hours debriefing, but this
hadn’t come up.</p>
<p>“It’s happening fast.” Rhiannon takes out her pen and paper.</p>
<p>“If by fast, you mean that half of Krovla has been painted red while
we were away, then yes, I’d say fast is a good term,” Ridoc notes from
Rhi’s right.</p>
<p>“You guys didn’t see any of it on your flight in?” Sawyer asks.</p>
<p>“No.” My grip tightens on my pen. “We flew over the ruins of Pavis.”
There are so many patches of red that they blend into one. Only the
southern tip and west of Krovla have been spared. Cordyn still stands,
but for how long? “Civilian casualties?”</p>
<p>Rhi’s mouth tightens. “Unknown, and the borders are a mess. People
are fleeing in every direction. Draithus is facing major supply
shortages. Too many people too fast.”</p>
<p>My stomach knots. Mira and Garrick were both sent to Draithus.</p>
<p>“Because your king won’t let anyone in.” Cat seethes.</p>
<p>A few heads turn in her direction before quickly looking away. It’s
been like that all day, cadets whispering and staring at us.</p>
<p>“What?” I lean forward to look past Maren as the stragglers take
their seats. “We’re still not taking civilians?”</p>
<p>“Guessing they skipped that part of your debrief,” she replies.</p>
<p>Or I’d only been interviewed by Navarrians.</p>
<p>“Welcome back to our travelers,” Professor Devera says as she takes
her position at the front, alongside Professor Kiandra. “From my
understanding, they have secured us an army of forty thousand soldiers
from an alliance with Zehyllna.” She gives me a subtle nod, and I force
a smile. “Which may help turn the tide of this war.”</p>
<p>But we failed to secure our primary objective. And lost a squadmate.
I’m going to need to get back into the gym with Imogen to carry all this
fucking guilt.</p>
<p>“I’d settle for a stalemate,” Maren says from my left.</p>
<p>“Also, welcome to our new guests.” Devera’s gaze flicks to the two
captains in rider black standing watch at the end of Aaric’s row.
“Please make yourselves as uncomfortable as possible.”</p>
<p>Aaric glares past Sloane and Baylor, then faces forward.</p>
<p>“On to battle strategy,” Devera announces. “Where should we put our
forty thousand troops?” she asks the room, then calls on a first-year
from Second Wing.</p>
<p>“They should be stationed here to protect the wardstone,” the
curly-haired guy replies.</p>
<p>“Yes, because that is where venin seem to be headed,” Imogen quips
from above us.</p>
<p>“Next,” Devera orders.</p>
<p>“They should be sent to the south to hold the line so Cordyn doesn’t
fall,” Cat says without being called on.</p>
<p>“That would be one excellent usage of them,” Devera agrees, “though I
wonder if your bias comes into play with that kind of decision, seeing
as it’s now the seat of power for your uncle.”</p>
<p>King Tecarus.</p>
<p>“What do our other travelers think?” Devera inquires, her gaze
skimming over us.</p>
<p>I stare at the western line that’s creeping closer to Tyrrendor and
keep my mouth closed so the same point can’t be made to me regarding
bias.</p>
<p>“They should be split,” Dain answers from above us. “Half to the
south to defend the new king and what’s left of the territory, and half
to the western line.”</p>
<p>“You would deploy all the troops within Poromiel?” she questions,
sitting back on her favorite spot on the table.</p>
<p>“It’s where they’re needed,” he answers with a certainty I envy. “And
before the riders in here get defensive, remember that protecting
Krovla’s western line keeps the dark wielders off Tyrrendor and Elsum,
and we’re bound by our alliance to defend King Tecarus.”</p>
<p>“And it was a flier who paid the cost of that army,” Cat adds.</p>
<p>“Solid points,” Devera admits. “Personally, I’d divvy the troops into
thirds, putting most along the lines Aetos suggested and the rest at our
outposts.” My brow furrows. Why would the outposts need more troops
within the wards? “If we start losing wards, there will be no safe
harbor on the Continent.”</p>
<p>“Safe for who, exactly?” Maren mutters.</p>
<p>“Hard for outposts to fall or lose wards when they’re already
protected,” Sawyer muses.</p>
<p>Unless they think the arsenals are at risk. All it takes is a
disruption in the power supply and the wards will fail.</p>
<p>“We’ll see what leadership decides.” Devera pauses, and her hands
trip on the edge of the desk. “It is not lost on me that today’s subject
will be a sensitive one—I know many of you had family there—but it is
critical that we discuss Suniva’s fall now that the intel reports are
in.”</p>
<p>There’s an immediate hum of tension within the room, as if half its
occupants can’t help but channel.</p>
<p>“How many of you know how it happened?” Devera’s gaze sweeps over
us.</p>
<p>A second-year flier from Third Wing raises her hand, and Devera nods
at her. “I don’t think any of us have all the details, but we know they
were taken by surprise. I heard twenty venin—”</p>
<p>“I heard it was more like thirty,” someone counters from the
right.</p>
<p>“Which is why we have this briefing.” Devera lifts her brows. “It
does us no good to train with misinformation and rumors.” She looks back
at the flier.</p>
<p>“They dropped out of the sky, which made Suniva’s fifty-foot walls
obsolete,” the flier continues, “then started a…fire. Is it true most
everyone burned to death?”</p>
<p>My stomach pitches. I can’t think of a more horrible way to die.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, yes.” Devera nods. “The fire started in the famous
textile district and, with the help of what we think were wind-wielding
venin, quickly devoured most of the city, despite the efforts of the
four drifts in permanent residence, all of whom perished. We had a riot
of four stationed there to protect the queen. One rider and two dragons
made it out alive, which is the only reason we have facts instead of
rumors to build on. Estimated casualties are somewhere around
twenty-five thousand lives.”</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>A flier two rows down hangs her head, and her shoulders shake.</p>
<p>“The fire did most of the work for them,” Devera continues, “allowing
their horde of approximately twelve wyvern to split into three
coordinated units.”</p>
<p>“There’s no way twelve wyvern took out Suniva!” a flier to the right
yells.</p>
<p>“Twelve wyvern. Twelve venin,” Devera answers without batting an eye.
“Four to hold the perimeter, four to fly directly to the palace, and
four to concentrate on the barracks and armory. Twelve of them took out
twenty-five thousand people. Putting your feelings aside,” Devera
instructs, raising her chin, “ask the questions that will allow you to
hypothetically change the outcome of this loss.”</p>
<p>The room falls quiet, and not a single hand rises.</p>
<p>Twenty-five thousand people. We’ve never studied a modern battle with
so many casualties before. How in Amari’s name are we supposed to
dissect one that not only killed some of our classmates’ families but
took the life of their queen? It hasn’t even been a week.</p>
<p>Devera looks to her right, and Professor Kiandra moves from the edge
of the room to the desk in the center of the stage.</p>
<p>“If we do not rip apart this tactic,” Kiandra lectures, “they will
use it again, and the next town they come for will be yours. Suniva was
our kingdom’s capital but our fourth-largest city. You honor the dead by
making sure no others fall in the same manner. We have to learn from
this. I know it’s hard, but in a matter of months, you third-years will
be on the front lines. That will mean you defending Diasyn.” She points
to someone above us. “Or you”—her finger swings left—“defending
Cordyn.”</p>
<p>“Start asking,” Devera orders. “Start thinking, or we’re all
dead.”</p>
<p>“What was in the armory?” Xaden’s voice carries over the hall.</p>
<p>I look back and find him standing in the doorway next to Bodhi, his
arms folded and jaw locked. My heart leaps. It’s been three days since
I’ve seen him. The beard he grew on the journey home has been shaved,
and the name tag is back on his uniform. Instinctively, I reach for the
bond, but his shields are up.</p>
<p>His gaze darts to mine and warms for the millisecond he holds contact
before we both turn our attention to the front of the room.</p>
<p>“They have to think for themselves, Professor Riorson.” Devera arches
a brow.</p>
<p>“What was in the armory?” he repeats.</p>
<p>Kiandra nods. “Six crates of freshly delivered alloy-hilted daggers,
and yes, the venin took them all.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s interest shifts forward, and it takes conscious effort to
pick my jaw up. There are maybe two crates kept at each outpost.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t Poromish forces use the damned daggers?” Ridoc asks.</p>
<p>“Because the damned daggers had only arrived a few hours earlier,”
Devera answers. “And the armory was the first target hit. Our best guess
is that there was simply no time to distribute them.”</p>
<p>“Why would six crates be sent there?” Caroline Ashton asks.</p>
<p>“Suniva was only supposed to be a distribution site. Drifts were set
to take the crates to other cities in the morning,” Kiandra answers.</p>
<p>Shit. The venin knew about the shipment. That’s the only logical
explanation.</p>
<p>“How many people knew the distribution schedule?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Right there.” Devera points at me. “The answer is too many. We have
traitors in our ranks.”</p>
<p>My pulse launches. How many Barlowes are out there, hiding among us?
Just waiting for their opportunity? The cadet turning in the Signet
Sparring pit proved some of us are willing to turn under the right
circumstances. Maybe even in this room.</p>
<p>“How did they get to Suniva without being detected?” Rhiannon asks.
“The area surrounding the city was clear for hundreds of miles. Fliers
and our riot had to be on patrol.”</p>
<p>“What’s common in Suniva in March?” Kiandra asks in answer.</p>
<p>Fuck if I know. That hasn’t exactly been a part of our education to
this point.</p>
<p>“Thunderstorms,” Kai answers from Aaric’s right. “From March until
about June, they roll in around five and are gone by midnight.”</p>
<p>Kiandra nods. “They flew in with the storm.”</p>
<p>“You mean above it?” a first-year asks.</p>
<p>“No, dumbass,” another first-year from First Wing counters. “They
can’t survive at that altitude.”</p>
<p>“Some storms are low enough to fly over,” Devera corrects, “which is
why you should pay more attention in class, Payson. In this case, they
flew within the cloud.”</p>
<p>Within the cloud? That would require… No way. It’s impossible.</p>
<p>Not with enough years of training.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t make sense,” a third-year calls out from above us.
“It’s an unacceptable risk to fly in those conditions unless absolutely
necessary due to the prevalence of lightning. We’re taught that in the
first month of flight maneuvers.”</p>
<p>Most of the room mutters in agreement.</p>
<p>“Which is why the patrols were grounded.” Devera stares at me like
she knows what I’m thinking.</p>
<p>“Maybe they don’t give a shit how many wyvern die,” Imogen
counters.</p>
<p>My heart races, and I shift my weight in my seat.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Rhiannon whispers.</p>
<p>“I know how they did it,” I reply just as quietly, my grip tightening
on my pen.</p>
<p>“Then say something,” Rhi prods like it’s first year all over
again.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be right,” I reply just as quietly.</p>
<p>“That’s a first,” Cat mutters.</p>
<p>Devera cocks her head to the side, calling me out without saying a
word.</p>
<p>My stomach hollows. Gods, I’m really going to have to say it.</p>
<p>“They’d give a shit about wyverns if they’re riding them,” the other
third-year retorts at Imogen. “They might not have souls, but they value
their lives, and no reasonable rider flies within a thunderstorm.”</p>
<p>“I do.” Fuck, I actually said it.</p>
<p>Every head turns my way, and Devera nods.</p>
<p>“I can direct my strikes within a cloud just like I did during the
battle here in December,” I continue. “Which means I could theoretically
control the natural strikes and move a riot within a thunderstorm with
relative safety…after about twenty years of practice.” I abandon my pen
on my notebook. Theophanie. “She was with them—their lightning wielder.
I’d guess that’s how the textile fire started, and probably what took
out the other dragons.”</p>
<p>“That’s what the report suggests,” Devera answers.</p>
<p>Shit. Shit. Shit. “To do all that after moving a horde through a
storm…” I shake my head. “She has to be a Maven.” And I’m a fucking
second-year who just spent three weeks chasing a mirage of hope on isles
without magic when I should have been training.</p>
<p>“Most likely,” Devera agrees, giving me the same look Mira had on
Zehyllna: expectation. Then she glances away. “So now let’s discuss how
we defeat this particular assault. What signets could have made the
difference? Nothing’s off the table. Who do you send to guard your most
valuable targets with this kind of threat?”</p>
<p>“Water wielders could have helped the fire,” someone suggests.</p>
<p>“You send Riorson,” Caroline Ashton says. “He’s the most powerful
rider we have, and he’s held back more than just a dozen wyvern. If
Riorson’s there, this doesn’t happen.”</p>
<p>True, but at what cost? Would he have channeled from the earth to
keep it from happening? I glance over my shoulder, but Xaden is already
gone.</p>
<p>“Don’t we have a fire wielder powerful enough to have controlled the
flames?” Baylor asks. “He’s a major stationed with the Southern
Wing.”</p>
<p>“Major Edorta is stationed at Athebyne,” Devera confirms.</p>
<p>Rhiannon glances sideways at me, then looks away.</p>
<p>“Your turn to say something,” I whisper. “Don’t hesitate.”</p>
<p>“No way. Not even in hypotheticals.” Sawyer shakes his head at Rhi as
people call out different signets around us. “You don’t send a cadet
against—”</p>
<p>“You send Sorrengail,” Rhiannon announces.</p>
<p>“—a Maven,” Sawyer finishes in a whisper. “And yet you just did.
Godsdamn.”</p>
<p>Cat and Maren both gawk at Rhi, and Sawyer sinks lower in his
seat.</p>
<p>“You said nothing was off the table,” Rhi adds, keeping her eyes
forward. “Sorrengail could have taken out a chunk of the wyvern on
approach by striking into that same cloud, including their lightning
wielder, as long as they don’t know Violet’s there.”</p>
<p>“And if they do?” Devera questions. “Remember that someone told them
about the daggers being moved.”</p>
<p>Rhi swallows, and her breaths speed up.</p>
<p>“Do your job.” I whisper the reminder. “It’s just a
hypothetical.”</p>
<p>She straightens her spine. “Then Sorrengail needs to be the better of
the two.”</p>
<p>And I’m not. I’m distracted the rest of the hour, thinking of
different tactics I could use to even the playing field between
Theophanie and me and coming up empty-handed, with the exception of one
fact. She wants me alive.</p>
<p>Battle Brief ends, and we have two precious hours before our next
class, which Ridoc uses to cajole Sawyer, Rhi, and me into going down to
the Archives.</p>
<p>Not that Sawyer needs much of a push.</p>
<p>“We really couldn’t have waited another couple of days?” I whisper at
Ridoc as we walk through the tunnel, passing the stairwell to the
interrogation chamber.</p>
<p>Rhi and Sawyer are far too into arguing about her decision to send me
off to the front to pay attention.</p>
<p>“No,” Ridoc says. “We couldn’t. One day, Battle Brief is going to
cover how a shadow wielder took out Cordyn, but you won’t be sitting in
your seat because they will have already killed you to stop him.”</p>
<p>“Not much of a Battle Brief if you already have the answer.” I flash
a fake smile.</p>
<p>“Basgiath was a unique case,” Sawyer argues with Rhi at my left. “We
were defending the school, and we kept the first-years out of it for the
very reason you can’t just order Violet into battle. They weren’t
prepared.”</p>
<p>“Stop,” I tell him. “It’s her job as a squad leader to see me as an
asset and not just her friend.”</p>
<p>“I still think it’s bullshit,” Sawyer mutters as we walk past the
scribe on duty at the Archives door.</p>
<p>“It’s war,” Rhiannon reminds him as we reach the table at the front.
“And I think it’s bullshit you haven’t even thought about flying
yet.”</p>
<p>Ridoc and I exchange a look of oh shit.</p>
<p>“I can’t,” he fires back in a whisper, tapping his cane against his
prosthesis. “Not with this thing. It’s not ready yet.”</p>
<p>There’s no need to ask for Jesinia. The class of scribes sitting at
their perfectly lined-up desks sends someone running to the back the
second they see us.</p>
<p>“You could ask Sliseag to—” Rhiannon starts.</p>
<p>“Sliseag isn’t Tairn,” Sawyer hisses. “I’m not about to ask him to
make exceptions for me—not when he risked bonding a repeat in the first
place.”</p>
<p>A few scribes pick their heads up, then quickly look away.</p>
<p>“You’d rather spend your time consulting with the retirees?” Rhi
counters. “You’re still a rider, Sawyer.”</p>
<p>“Maybe we should ease up,” Ridoc suggests.</p>
<p>Sawyer’s face flushes. “All respect, but you have no idea what this
is like, Rhi.”</p>
<p>I lean into Rhi just enough to get her attention, then shake my head
subtly. “Subject change,” I suggest in a whisper.</p>
<p>Her mouth purses, and she sighs. “What’s going on with you and
Riorson?” she asks, keeping her voice just as low as mine. “You didn’t
so much as smile when you saw him during Battle Brief.”</p>
<p>“He’s brooding.” I shrug.</p>
<p>“That’s a word for it,” Ridoc says, pressing down a corner of his
ice-wielding patch that’s come unsewn.</p>
<p>Jesinia emerges from the back of the Archives, holding a small paper
bundle tied with twine. She quickly makes her way toward us, immediately
gifting Sawyer with a smile as she sets the book-size package on the
table and pushes it toward me.</p>
<p>“Hi,” he signs, and damn if his grin doesn’t tug at the corners of my
mouth.</p>
<p>“Hi,” she signs, then turns toward us. “Your reports have been fun to
read, but it’s good to have you back so you can tell me about the trip
in person.” Her gaze meets mine. “That was delivered for you by courier
this morning—I intercepted it before Aetos could open it like he does
all of your mail.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I sign, then pick up the package. It’s far too soft, too
malleable to be a book, and the tag labeled with my name and quadrant is
from a seamstress in Chantara.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>“We need somewhere private,” Ridoc signs.</p>
<p>Rhi’s brow furrows. “What’s going on?” she signs.</p>
<p>“Please,” Ridoc signs to Jesinia.</p>
<p>She nods, then leads us to one of the private, windowless study rooms
that line the front wall of the Archives and motions us inside.</p>
<p>I head in first with Sawyer, and the others follow. “I know Sliseag
isn’t Tairn,” I whisper as we make our way around to the back of the
table. “And I also know it can be hard to do things differently,
especially in an environment that demands perfection and
uniformity.”</p>
<p>“An environment that produces perfection and uniformity.” Sawyer
stiffens, glancing across the table at Rhi and Ridoc as she quizzes him
again as to why we’re here.</p>
<p>Oh. I get it now. “For me, flying…differently is worth it,” I say
under my breath as we sit. “But whether you feel the same about asking
Sliseag for help is a question only you can answer.”</p>
<p>“I think I could keep my seat,” he admits quietly. “Most of that is
thigh work. It’s mounting that intimidates me.”</p>
<p>“Anything I can do to help?” I ask him.</p>
<p>Jesinia peeks through the doorway as if checking to see that we
weren’t followed, then closes the door.</p>
<p>Sawyer shakes his head. “I’ve been working toward the run and making
adjustments to the prosthesis for the climb. I just need to get it
right, make sure it works before I let myself hope.” His gaze flickers
to Rhi.</p>
<p>“You could never disappoint her,” I rush as Jesinia turns toward
us.</p>
<p>“Our friend? Never. Our squad leader?” He grimaces.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be in here,” Jesinia signs, “so make it quick before
they come kick you out.”</p>
<p>Ridoc leans all the way back in his chair and stares at me.</p>
<p>“What is happening?” Rhi signs, looking between the two of us.</p>
<p>“Tell them,” Ridoc signs. “Or I will.”</p>
<p>I sigh. There’s no point being nervous. Either I trust my friends, or
I don’t.</p>
<p>“Xaden is slowly turning venin,” I say and sign.</p>
<p>Rhi’s eyes widen, and she leans forward. “Talk.”</p>
<p>I think I started falling for you that night in the tree when I
watched you with the marked ones, but I began tumbling the day you gave
me Tairn’s saddle. You’ll give some self-serving excuse, but the truth
is you’re kinder than you want people to know. Maybe kinder than you
know.</p>
