<h4 id="chapter-three">Chapter Three</h4>
<p>Xaden can sense them.</p>
<p>My fingernails bend slightly when my hand flexes along the grout
line, holding on for dear life as my mind spins. But just because he can
sense them doesn’t mean he gave up part of his soul, right? It’s there
in his eyes, watching me, waiting for me to reject him, or worse, push
him away like I did after Resson.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s more dire than I thought, but he’s still whole, still him.
Just with…heightened senses.</p>
<p>I shove my stomach right back where it belongs and hold his stare.
“Scared of you?” I shake my head. “Never.”</p>
<p>“You will be,” he whispers, looking over my features like he needs to
memorize them.</p>
<p>“Your five minutes are up,” Garrick says from the base of the steps.
“And Violet has a meeting to get to.”</p>
<p>Xaden’s expression shifts into something dangerous as he glares at
his best friend and leans away from me.</p>
<p>“She told you we think you should sleep somewhere else, didn’t she?”
Garrick rolls his neck like he’s preparing for a fight.</p>
<p>“She did.” Xaden starts down the steps, and I follow. “And I’ll tell
you the same thing she said to Imogen. Get fucked.”</p>
<p>“Figured.” Garrick turns a pleading look on me, and I smile back as
we walk out of the academic wing and into the surprisingly empty
rotunda, crossing between two dragon pillars. “Thought you’d at least be
logical, Violet.”</p>
<p>“Me? You’re the ones acting based on feelings and with no evidence
whatsoever. My decision to trust him is based purely on the facts of our
proven history.”</p>
<p>“As much as I appreciate the concern,” Xaden drawls, his voice edging
on icy, “you try to dictate the occupants of Violet’s bed again, and
we’re going to have problems.”</p>
<p>Garrick shakes his head at his best friend but drops the subject as
we make our way to main campus, passing through the chaotic cleanup near
the infirmary.</p>
<p>The death roll in the Infantry Quadrant will be painfully long
tomorrow.</p>
<p>“For someone who’s about to face the highest-ranking aristocracy in
the kingdom, you seem pretty calm, Sorrengail,” Garrick remarks as we
cross onto the thick red carpet of the administration building.</p>
<p>The hallway is cramped with people in tunics of various colors
waiting for talks to resume, identified only by the heraldry embroidered
on cross-body sashes that remind me of our dress uniforms. Our own
provinces are easy to recognize, and I even spot Braevick’s as heads
begin to turn in our direction.</p>
<p>“I’ve known this was coming and have a plan. Two weeks is a lot of
time to overthink every possible scenario,” I reply as the crowd slowly
parts to the side of the hall in what I’ve come to think of as the Xaden
effect. I can’t blame them for staring. He’s gorgeous. I can’t blame
them for backing up, either. He’s not only terrifyingly powerful, he’s
known to be responsible for splitting Navarre’s riot and providing
weapons to Poromiel.</p>
<p>Safe to say not every gaze trained on him—on any of the three of
us—is friendly.</p>
<p>“You’re sure this is what you want?” Xaden asks as we approach the
massive double doors of the great hall.</p>
<p>“It’s what she wants,” I tell him, and one of the guards adorned with
the crest of Calldyr slips into the hall, no doubt to announce our
arrival. “And it’s what we need. You still up for coming with?” I glance
at him. “Even beyond the wards?”</p>
<p>The magical barrier is doing more than protecting us from him—it’s
protecting him from himself.</p>
<p>His jaw flexes. “Even beyond the wards,” he confirms as we reach the
doors and the remaining stone-faced guard in infantry blue.</p>
<p>“I assume you’re expecting me?” I ask the guard.</p>
<p>“You will wait to be escorted, Cadet Sorrengail,” she replies without
looking my way.</p>
<p>Pleasant.</p>
<p>“I’m starting to think twice about this meeting,” Garrick says from
Xaden’s other side, his gaze scanning the heavily armed crowd in the
hallway. “She’s been invited to appear before the Senarium alone, and we
haven’t exactly been pardoned for leaving Basgiath and taking a large
portion of the riot. Brennan might be sitting in on the treaty
negotiations on behalf of Aretia, but we don’t have a seat on the
council. Anything could happen to Violet in there.”</p>
<p>“Already thought about that,” I assure him. “They need me alive for
Andarna’s sake if not Tairn’s. I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“She has Lewellen in there representing Tyrrendor and can set the
whole damned place on fire with a wave of her hand,” Xaden adds, folding
his arms and glowering at the guard. “I’m more concerned for their
safety than hers.”</p>
<p>The door on the right opens, and the other guard walks through.</p>
<p>My stomach twists when General Melgren appears in the doorway, his
beady eyes narrowing as he looks down his beak of a nose at me. “Cadet
Sorrengail, the Senarium is ready to receive you.” His gaze darts to
Garrick, then Xaden. “Alone.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be right out here”—Xaden’s tone slips into menace—“deterred by
these wooden doors that hang an inch off the ground.”</p>
<p>“Subtle.” I fight the tug at the corner of my mouth.</p>
<p>Melgren gestures me inside but doesn’t take his eyes off Xaden.</p>
<p>“Never going to be,” he replies as I walk into the hall. “I have
every faith in your ability to protect yourself, but say the word and
I’ll rip the doors off their hinges.”</p>
<p>“You’re such a romantic.” I quickly take in the new furniture
arrangement of the familiar room, finding a long trestle table running
the length of the hall with dozens of chairs, no doubt to accommodate
the negotiations. Six nobles dressed in lushly embroidered tunics and
gowns sit facing me at the closest end, representing each of Navarre’s
six provinces. I know them all thanks to my mother, but only the one on
the far left offers me a tired smile as I approach the center of their
grouping and place my hands on the back of the chair.</p>
<p>Lewellen.</p>
<p>“Any last-minute additions?” I ask Andarna as Melgren walks around
the table and sits to the right of the Duchess of Morraine.</p>
<p>“Nothing that comes to mind,” she responds.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>“Let’s make this quick,” the Duchess of Morraine snaps in a
high-pitched voice from the right, a giant ruby jostling along her
collarbone when she heaves a sigh. “We have three days to save these
negotiations and need every hour of it.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t agree more—” I start.</p>
<p>“We’ve been briefed by General Melgren and conferred with the king,”
the Duke of Calldyr interrupts directly across from me, stroking his
short blond beard. “As of this moment, you will be assigned to a—” He
glances at Melgren. “What did you call it?”</p>
<p>“A task force,” Melgren supplies, sitting eerily still as he studies
me.</p>
<p>“Task force,” the duke repeats. “Which will embark on a quest to find
and recruit the seventh dragon breed with an aim to increase our numbers
and hopefully provide insight into killing the venin.”</p>
<p>I reach into the pocket of my uniform and pull out two folded pieces
of parchment. I hold up the first. “Should we agree to participate, this
is a list of Andarna’s demands.”</p>
<p>The Duchess of Elsum raises her dark brows, and the Duke of Luceras
recoils.</p>
<p>“You are not in a place to make demands,” the Duchess of Morraine
admonishes. “While we owe your mother a debt of gratitude, you are still
considered a deserter.”</p>
<p>“A deserter who saved this college, our wards, and our kingdom, not
to mention took on multiple venin within these walls a few hours ago,
all of which I’ve done without falling under Navarrian chain of
command.” I tilt my head. “Makes it hard to assign me to anything, as
none of you commands the Aretian riot. And they’re not my demands,
they’re hers.”</p>
<p>“The return of our riot is a matter still in negotiation.” Melgren
glances down the table at Lewellen. “This assignment is being made in
good faith, with the understanding that the riot will remain at
Basgiath. Lewellen, seeing as you’ve secretly represented Aretia for
years—which is a separate issue this council has yet to address—perhaps
you’d be willing to read her demands.”</p>
<p>The rebuke has most of the aristocrats shifting in their seats.</p>
<p>Lewellen holds out his hand, and I give him the folded list. Step
one, complete. A smile tugs at the corners of his lined mouth as he
reads. “Some of these are quite…unique.”</p>
<p>“As is she,” I reply, launching into step two. “I will take six
riders—”</p>
<p>“You will take no one,” Melgren interrupts. “You are a second-year
cadet who will only be allowed to participate because we need your
dragon. It has already been decided that Captain Grady will lead the
task force, due largely to his experience behind enemy lines.”</p>
<p>My stomach sinks. “My RSC professor?” No, no, no, this is not how
this was supposed to go. I grasp the list that has Mira’s name inked at
the top.</p>
<p>“The same.” Melgren nods. “He’s been made aware, and you can expect
to hear from him once we’ve settled the Poromish alliance and its
requirements and he’s configured the squad of his choosing.”</p>
<p>His choosing. Power rises within me, simmering in my blood. “Which
will at least include Lieutenant Riorson, correct?”</p>
<p>The aristocrats all look to Melgren.</p>
<p>“Riorson’s involvement will be at Grady’s discretion.” Melgren stares
back at me, unflinching.</p>
<p>“Tairn and Sgaeyl can’t be separated,” I argue.</p>
<p>“Which would suggest Riorson will be among his selections,” Melgren
states with about as much emotion as a tree. No wonder Mom liked him so
much. “But again, it’s at the captain’s discretion.”</p>
<p>Captain’s discretion. My blood hums. “Determining the members of the
squad is one of Andarna’s demands.” In every scenario I’d thought
through, Andarna’s compliance had always been the card I’d mentally
played.</p>
<p>“Then it’s one that won’t be met.” Melgren folds his hands in his
lap. “It’s a nonnegotiable military operation, not a class field
trip.”</p>
<p>“We won’t go,” Tairn states.</p>
<p>“We have to go!” Andarna argues, her voice rising.</p>
<p>The parchment crumples in my hand. “She’s right. We have to go.”
Andarna deserves this, first and foremost. But if there’s any chance
they know how to defeat the venin or how to cure Xaden, then we truly
have no choice. “Every possible path.” Which means we have to give.</p>
<p>“Shall we consider the matter settled?” the Duke of Calldyr asks.</p>
<p>Absolutely the fuck not.</p>
<p>“It is,” Melgren states.</p>
<p>“Only if you meet the rest of Andarna’s demands.” I lift my chin. “I
think both she and Tairn have shown they’re more than willing to walk—if
not fly—away from Basgiath.”</p>
<p>Melgren’s nostrils flare, and I bite back a crow of victory. “We will
consider approving her other requests.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s settled,” the Duke of Calldyr announces. “Excellent. This
development should help smooth negotiations.”</p>
<p>“At least letting the fliers enter the quadrant would help,” I add,
frustration burning in my chest.</p>
<p>“When they can’t even wield to protect themselves?” Melgren scoffs.
“The riders will eat them alive.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that one of Poromiel’s arguments against leaving those
additional forces with us?” the Duchess of Morraine asks, and Melgren
nods.</p>
<p>They aren’t forces. They’re cadets in need of the protection of the
wards.</p>
<p>The duke scratches his neck. “We’ll think on it. The fliers handling
themselves in the quadrant would go a long way toward smoothing that
negotiation point.”</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly.</p>
<p>“You’re dismissed, cadet,” Melgren orders.</p>
<p>“I’ll walk you out,” Lewellen says, pushing away from the table and
rising to his feet.</p>
<p>I slip the mangled list into my pocket and cross the cobblestones to
the door, trying to pick up the pieces of my shattered expectations.
There’s no telling if we’ll be able to trust whoever Grady selects for
the squad.</p>
<p>“I’ll work on these,” Lewellen says quietly, raising the list of
Andarna’s demands. “And in the meantime”—he reaches into his tunic and
retrieves a palm-size missive—“I was asked to give you this
privately.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I respond out of habit, taking the parchment.</p>
<p>He knocks twice on the door, and I depart through the one the guard
gestures me through on the left.</p>
<p>Opening the missive, I walk into the hall, recognizing Tecarus’s
sprawling handwriting.</p>
<p>You have three days to hold up your end of our bargain.</p>
<p>Fuck. That’s not an option. I look up and find every member of my
squad waiting, a wall of black and brown holding back a sea of colorful
tunics and gowns.</p>
<p>“How did it go?” Imogen asks.</p>
<p>“Give her a second,” Rhi lectures.</p>
<p>My gaze sweeps over them as the door shuts behind me, and then I lock
eyes with Xaden, who is crossing the distance between us. “The plan went
to shit.”</p>
<p>Which means the one I’m holding in my hand can’t fail.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Morning light pours in through my window, and I slowly blink awake to
the sound of the campus bells chiming eight times. Snow sits stacked on
the sill, but the skies beyond are blue for the first time since
solstice.</p>
<p>Holy shit, I didn’t just sleep, I slept in. Maybe it was hitting the
gym last night with Imogen, or the emotional letdown after I’d vented
with Rhi and Tara about why Grady was the worst possible choice to lead
Andarna’s mission, but I didn’t wake once, thank gods. I must have
drifted off after settling into bed with the book on Navarrian imports
predating the Trade Agreement of Resson that Jesinia had tossed at me
when I’d shown up to visit Sawyer, still seething. Lifting my head from
the pillow, I spot the closed book on my nightstand, my page marked by
one of Xaden’s daggers.</p>
<p>A slow smile curves my mouth at his thoughtfulness. Guess I’d been
asleep by the time he made it to bed after his daily meeting with
Brennan, Lewellen, and, as of yesterday afternoon, Duke Lindell, who
fostered Xaden and Liam.</p>
<p>I turn under the warmth of the blankets, fully expecting to find
Xaden wide awake given the hour, but he’s fast asleep with one arm
curled around his pillow and the other with its freshly pink scar lying
on the blanket between us. My heart clenches, and staring seems the only
logical action, if only for just a few moments. Gods, is he beautiful.
His face is softened in sleep, and all the tension he usually carries in
his jaw, his shoulders, is strikingly absent. The last week has been
hard on him, being constantly torn between his duties as a rider and
navigating the responsibility he carries for Aretia in a space that
doesn’t recognize it. I fight the urge to touch him. He’s slept like
shit since the battle, too, and if he can get even just another few
minutes, he should have it.</p>
<p>As slowly and silently as possible, I scoot toward my side of the bed
and sit up, letting my feet dangle just above the floor. My hair is
still partly damp from braiding it right after my bath last night, and I
make quick, quiet work of running my brush through it so it has a prayer
of drying before it’s time to head out into the cold. Once I set the
brush back on the nightstand, I stretch with a speed a sloth would be
proud of—</p>
<p>A band of shadow wraps around my waist a second before my hair is
swept to the side and Xaden sets his lips to the juncture of my neck and
shoulder in an open-mouthed kiss.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>I gasp as an immediate flare of heat races down my spine at the lash
of his tongue, the scrape of his teeth, and my head falls back against
his shoulder. He moves straight to the hypersensitive spot at the side
of my neck like my body is a map only he has the key to, and I spear my
fingers into his hair as my back arches. Damn, he knows exactly how to
take me from the ground to sky-fucking-high in less than a handful of
heartbeats.</p>
<p>“Mine,” he growls against my skin, and his hand skims the hemline of
my nightdress before dragging it up my thigh.</p>
<p>“Mine,” I counter, tightening my grip in his hair.</p>
<p>He laughs into my neck, the sound low and intoxicating as his hand
crosses over the juncture of my thighs, then grabs hold of my hip and
tugs.</p>
<p>My fingers slip from his hair, and the room spins before my back hits
the center of the bed. Then he’s all I see, rising above me with a
wicked smile in nothing but loose sleeping pants, sliding his hard thigh
between mine. “Yours,” he says like a promise, and my breath catches at
the intensity in his eyes.</p>
<p>Gods, it feels like my chest is going to crack open when he looks at
me like that.</p>
<p>“I love you so much it hurts.” I slide my hands down the warm, bare
skin of his chest, my fingertips ghosting the scar over his heart and
down to the rigid lines of his stomach.</p>
<p>He draws a sharp breath through his teeth. “Good, because that’s
exactly how I love you, too.” His thigh moves between mine with
exquisite friction, and then he’s all over me, erasing every one of my
thoughts except how I can get him closer.</p>
<p>His hands stroke every curve, and his mouth caresses every inch of
skin down to my neckline. Need races through my veins like flame,
igniting every nerve ending, then flaring bright as his teeth graze the
tip of my breast through the fabric of my nightdress.</p>
<p>I whimper and lace my fingers behind his neck. Holy shit do I need
this man.</p>
<p>“That’s one of my favorite sounds.” His words wrap around my mind as
his hand glides up my thigh, slipping under my nightdress to toy with
the line of my underwear, and I fucking melt. “Second only to those
little gasps you make in the moments before you come.”</p>
<p>His knuckles brush over my clit through the infuriating layer of
fabric between us, and my hips rock as his mouth moves to my other
breast. There are too many damned clothes between us.</p>
<p>He lifts his head to watch me as his fingers dip beneath the barrier
of my underwear. Then he’s right there, stroking and teasing, slipping
over my clit, and finally, thank-fucking-gods, giving me the exact
pressure I need.</p>
<p>“Xaden,” I moan, and my head thrashes on the pillow as power whips
through me, racing down every bone, every vein, every inch of my
skin.</p>
<p>“Changed my mind.” He slides two fingers inside me. “That’s my
favorite sound.” His fingers stroke deep, then curl upward as he
withdraws just enough.</p>
<p>My breath hitches, and a corner of his mouth rises into a smirk that
has my walls clenching around his talented fingers. Power hums,
spiraling into a tight coil within me, and my hands slip to clutch his
shoulders, pressing into his rebellion relic.</p>
<p>“How do you want me to take you, Violet?” His brow furrows as he adds
his thumb against my clit, and the energy gathering within me vibrates.
“Here on your back with me above you? Before me on your hands and knees
with your ass in the air? Against the wall so I can drive harder?
Astride so you can control the pace? Tell me.”</p>
<p>Control? That’s only an illusion when it comes to being with him. The
second he touches me, I’m his to do with however he wants.</p>
<p>“All of it.” I’m on fire in the sweetest way possible, and his words
fan the flames. I don’t care how he gets inside me, I only care that
it’s right. Fucking. Now.</p>
<p>His eyes flare. “I can feel it. I can feel you.” He stares for a
second longer, then lowers his head to mine, hovering an inch or two
above my lips, and quickens the pace of his fingers, winding me so tight
I know the only way I’ll survive it is to shatter. “Bright and hot and
fucking perfect.”</p>
<p>And I want all of him, his cock, not just his fingers. I can feel
just how hard he is against my thigh, and I need him moving within me,
with me, unraveling, wild and unhinged. I just can’t find those words,
not when he’s set on making me speechless.</p>
<p>I grasp for the shimmering onyx that connects our minds and pour my
pure, acute need into it as my breath comes faster and faster.</p>
<p>“Violet,” he groans, and lines etch between his brow as his jaw
flexes, as if he’s holding himself back.</p>
<p>Why would he be fighting this? Fighting us? I’m his, but he’s mine,
too. Doesn’t he remember how good we are together? Holding the bond with
a viselike grip, I recall the armoire cracking against my back, the
sublime feel of him pounding into me, hard and so damned deep, both of
us lost in the other, breathing the same heated air, living for nothing
but the peak of the next thrust.</p>
<p>The power coiled within me starts to burn, flushing my skin and
threatening to incinerate everything I am if I don’t let it go. Gods,
how it would feel to have that soft brush of his shadows all over my
skin, enveloping me with a thousand caresses as he—</p>
<p>His forehead falls against mine, and he trembles, sweat beading on
his forehead. “Fuck, love.”</p>
<p>There’s something about hearing that guttural groan, all rasp and
desperation, that hurtles me over the edge with the next stroke of his
fingers. I try to hold it close, but power snaps, and light flashes to
my left as I shatter. Shadow floods the space for a stuttered heartbeat
as pleasure crests in waves, pulling me under and dragging me to the
surface again and again.</p>
<p>I catch the scent of burned wood, and Xaden whips both his hands to
the headboard above me. The torture twisting his face sobers me up in
less than a second. He looks like he’s in unbearable pain.</p>
<p>“Xaden?” I whisper, reaching for him.</p>
<p>“Don’t.” It comes out half demand and all plea.</p>
<p>My hands fall to my chest, and when I trip down our bond, it’s faded
and sealed by a wall of chilled onyx. “What’s happening?”</p>
<p>“I need space.” He bites out the words.</p>
<p>“All right.” I get out from under him and scurry off the bed,
immediately spotting the scorched crack in the nightstand. At least I’m
getting better at not setting the trees on fire. “Is this far
enough?”</p>
<p>“Not sure the isle kingdoms would be far enough,” he mutters, slowing
his breathing.</p>
<p>What the fuck? “I’m sorry?” I watch in utter confusion as he gathers
his control, then nods like he’s certain of himself again.</p>
<p>“I forgot.” He slowly lets go of the headboard and sits back on his
heels, gripping his thighs, then letting his hands fall at his sides. “I
woke up and saw you sitting there, and it was the most natural thing in
the world to reach for you, but I’m not natural anymore. Fuck, I’m so
sorry, Violet.”</p>
<p>Oh. “I forgot, too.” The second he put his mouth on me. “You have
nothing to apologize for, and don’t say you’re not natural—” Wait. My
mouth curves. This is a totally solvable problem. “In fact, I think you
just did us a favor.” I take a single step toward the bed, and his head
snaps in my direction. “Nothing bad happened, Xaden. You just had your
hands all over me, inside me, and I’m perfectly fine. Give me two
seconds to crawl across this bed, and you’ll be gloriously fine,
too.”</p>
<p>His eyes slide shut, and he gestures to the headboard. “Not
fine.”</p>
<p>My gaze narrows on the dark wood, and I have to lean in a little to
finally see two faint marks of discoloration, barely a shade lighter
than the original stain, right where his thumbs had been. I cover my
stomach with my hand like that can keep it from sinking.</p>
<p>Did he just channel?</p>
<p>There are two reasons rider cadets are not given the</p>
<p>same summer and winter leave as others:</p>
<p>Firstly, civilians do not react well to dragons</p>
<p>casually roaming their villages.</p>
<p>Secondly, raising tigers for war requires locking their</p>
<p>cages lest they turn on each other…or you.</p>
