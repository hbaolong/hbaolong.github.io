<h4 id="the-rendezvous">29. The Rendezvous</h4>
<p>The next morning Kramer and Bernie Fitzgibbon and the two detectives,
Martin and Goldberg, were in Abe Weiss’s office. It was like a board
meeting. Weiss sat at the head of the big walnut conference table.
Fitzgibbon and Goldberg sat to his left; Kramer and Martin, to his
right. The subject was how to proceed with a grand-jury hearing on the
Sherman McCoy case. Weiss did not like what he was now hearing from
Martin. Neither did Kramer. From time to time Kramer took a look at
Bernie Fitzgibbon. All he could make out was a mask of black Irish
impassivity, but it emitted short waves that said, “I told you so.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” said Weiss. He was talking to Martin. “Tell me again
how you picked up these two characters.”</p>
<p>“It was in a crack sweep,” said Martin.</p>
<p>“A crack sweep?” said Weiss. “What the hell’s a crack sweep?”</p>
<p>“A crack sweep’s a—that’s what we do now. Some blocks up there,
there’s so many crack dealers on the block it’s like a flea market. A
lot of the buildings are abandoned, and the others, the people that live
there, they’re afraid to come out the front door, because there’s
nothing on the street but people selling crack, people buying crack, and
people smoking crack. So we make these sweeps. We move in and we pick up
everything that’s loose.”</p>
<p>“Does it work?”</p>
<p>“Sure. You do it a couple of times and they’ll move to another block.
It’s got to the point where as soon as the first cruiser comes around
the corner, they start running from the buildings. It’s like these
construction sites when they set off the dynamite and the rats start
running down the street. Somebody oughta take along a movie camera one
time. Here’s all these people running down the fucking street.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Weiss. “So these two guys you picked up, they know
Roland Auburn?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. They all know Roland.”</p>
<p>“Okay. So what you’re telling us—this is something Roland told them
personally or this is something they heard?”</p>
<p>“No, this is the word that’s going around.”</p>
<p>“In Bronx crack circles,” said Weiss.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess,” said Martin.</p>
<p>“Okay, go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Well, the word is that Roland happens to see this kid, Henry Lamb,
walking up to the Texas Fried Chicken place, and he tags along. Roland
enjoys giving this kid a hard time. Lamb’s what they call a ‘good-doing
boy,’ a mama’s boy, a boy who don’t ‘come out.’ He don’t come out of the
house and get into the street life. He goes to school, he goes to
church, he wants to go to college, he don’t get into trouble—he don’t
even belong in the projects. His mother’s trying to save up money for a
down payment on a house in Springfield Gardens, or they wouldn’t even be
living there.”</p>
<p>“These two guys didn’t tell you that.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s what we already found out about the kid and his
mother.”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s stick to these two smokeheads and what they said.”</p>
<p>“I was trying to give you the background.”</p>
<p>“Good. Now give me the foreground.”</p>
<p>“Awright. So anyway, Roland’s walking down Bruckner Boulevard with
Lamb. They’re walking past the ramp at Hunts Point Avenue, and Roland
sees this shit on the ramp, these tires or trash cans or something, and
he knows somebody’s been up there trying to take off cars. So he says to
Lamb, ‘Come on, I’ll show you how to take off a car.’ Lamb don’t want
any part of that, and so Roland says, ‘I’m not gonna do it, I’m just
gonna show you how you do it. Whaddayou afraid of?’ He’s, you know,
taunting the kid, because he’s such a mama’s boy. So the kid walks up on
the ramp with him, and the next thing he knows, Roland throws a tire or
a can or something in front of this car, this terrific-looking Mercedes,
and it turns out to be McCoy and some broad. This poor fucker, Lamb, is
just standing there. He’s probably scared shitless to be there, and he’s
scared shitless about running, too, because of Roland, who’s only doing
this whole number to let him know what a faggot he is in the first
place. Then something goes wrong, because McCoy and the woman manage to
get the hell outta there, and Lamb gets sideswiped. Anyway, that’s
what’s going around out on the street.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s some theory. But have you found anybody who says they
actually heard Roland say any a that?”</p>
<p>Bernie Fitzgibbon broke in. “That theory would explain why Lamb don’t
say anything about being hit by a car when he goes to the hospital. He
don’t want anybody to think he was involved in trying to take off a car.
He just wants to get his wrist fixed up and go home.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Weiss, “but all we got here is a theory presented by two
smokeheads. Those people don’t know the difference between what they’re
hearing and what they’re hearing.” He twirled his forefinger up around
his temple in the Looney Tunes mode.</p>
<p>“Well, I think it’s worth checking out, Abe,” said Bernie. “I think
we oughta spend a little time on it, anyhow.”</p>
<p>Kramer felt alarmed and resentful and protective, protective of
Roland Auburn. None of them had bothered to get to know Roland the way
he had. Roland was not a saint, but he had goodness in him, and he was
telling the truth.</p>
<p>He said to Bernie, “There’s no harm in checking it out, but I can
think of ways a theory like this actually gets started. I mean, it’s
really the McCoy theory. It’s what McCoy fed the Daily News, and it’s on
TV. I mean, this theory is already out on the street, and this is what
it grows into. It answers one question, but it raises ten more. I mean,
why would Roland try to take off a car with this kid along who he knows
is a wimp, a lame? And if McCoy is the victim of a robbery attempt and
he hits one of his assailants, why would he hesitate to report it to the
cops? He’d do it like that.” Kramer snapped his fingers and realized an
argumentative tone had taken over his voice.</p>
<p>“I agree, it raises a lot of questions,” said Bernie. “All the more
reason not to rush this thing through the grand jury.”</p>
<p>“We got to rush it,” said Weiss.</p>
<p>Kramer caught Bernie looking at him in a certain way. He could see
accusations in his black Irish eyes.</p>
<p>Just then the telephone on Weiss’s desk gave three low beeps. He got
up, walked over to the desk, and answered it.</p>
<p>“Yeah?…Okay, put him on…No, I haven’t seen The City Light…What? You
gotta be kidding…”</p>
<p>He turned toward the conference table and said to Bernie, “It’s Milt.
I don’t think we gotta worry about any smokehead theories for a
while.”</p>
<p>In no time Milt Lubell, wide-eyed, slightly out of breath, was
walking into the room with a copy of The City Light. He laid it on the
conference table. The front page jumped up at them.</p>
<p>City Light Exclusive:</p>
<p>FINANCIER’S</p>
<p>WIDOW IS</p>
<p>MCCOY CASE</p>
<p>MYSTERY GIRL</p>
<p>McCoy At Funeral: “Help Me!”</p>
<p>Across the bottom of the page ran a line saying: Peter Fallow’s
Eyewitness Report, Pictures, pages 3, 4, 5, 14, 15.</p>
<p>All six of them stood up and leaned over with their palms on the
walnut table to support themselves. Their heads converging over the
epicenter, which was the headline.</p>
<p>Weiss straightened up. On his face was the look of the man who knows
that it falls to his lot to be the leader.</p>
<p>“All right, here’s what we’re gonna do. Milt, call up Irv Stone at
Channel 1.” He then reeled off the names of the news producers of five
other channels. “And call Fallow. And that fellow Flannagan at the News.
And here’s what you tell them. We’re gonna question this woman as soon
as possible. That’s for the record. Not for attribution, tell ’em if she
is the woman who was with McCoy, then she faces felony charges, because
she was the one who drove off after McCoy hit the kid. That’s leaving
the scene and failure to report. Hit-and-run. He hit, she ran.
Okay?”</p>
<p>Then to Bernie: “And you guys…” He let his eyes pan quickly over
Kramer, Martin, and Goldberg, to show them they were included. “You guys
get hold of this woman, and you tell her the exact same thing. ‘We’re
sorry your husband is dead, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, but we need
some answers very fast, and if you’re the one who was in the car with
McCoy, then you’re in a whole lotta freakin’ trouble.’ But if she’s
willing to come clean about McCoy, we’ll grant her immunity before the
grand jury.” To Kramer: “Don’t get too specific about that at first.
Well, hell, you know how to do it.”</p>
<p>By the time Kramer, Martin, and Goldberg pulled up in front of 962
Fifth Avenue, the sidewalk looked like a refugee camp. Television
crewmen, radio broadcasters, reporters, and photographers sat, milled,
and lollygagged about in the jeans, knit shirts, zipper jackets, and
Trapper Dan shoes their trade currently affected, and the idle gawkers
who looked on weren’t dressed much better. The cops from the 19th
Precinct had set up a double row of blue police line sawhorses to create
an alley to the front door for the benefit of the people who lived in
the building. A uniformed patrolman stood by. For such a building,
fourteen stories high and half a block wide, the front entrance was not
particularly grand. Nevertheless, it bespoke money. There was a single
plate-glass door framed in heavy brass, highly polished, and protected
by an ornate brass grillwork, which also gleamed. A canopy stretched
from the door to the edge of the sidewalk. The canopy was supported by
brass poles with brass guy rods, likewise polished until they looked
like white gold. As much as anything else, it was the eternity of mule’s
work represented by all the hand-polished brass that said money. Behind
the plate glass, Kramer could see the figures of a pair of uniformed
doormen, and he thought of Martin and his soliloquy on the shitballs at
McCoy’s building.</p>
<p>Well…here he was. He had looked up at these apartment buildings on
Fifth Avenue, facing Central Park, a thousand times at least, most
recently on Sunday afternoon. He had been out in the park with Rhoda,
who was pushing Joshua in the baby carriage, and the afternoon sun had
lit up the great limestone façades to the point where the phrase itself
had crossed his mind: the gold coast. But it was merely an observation,
devoid of emotion, except perhaps for a mild feeling of satisfaction at
being able to stroll amid such golden surroundings. It was well known
that the richest people in New York lived in those buildings. But their
life, whatever it was, was as remote as another planet. Such people were
merely types, far outside the range of any conceivable envy. They were
The Rich. He couldn’t have told you the name of a single one of
them.</p>
<p>Now he could.</p>
<p>Kramer, Martin, and Goldberg got out of the car, and Martin said
something to the cop in the uniform. The raggedy pack of journalists
bestirred themselves. Their itchy clothes flopped about. They looked the
three of them up and down and sniffed for the scent of the McCoy
case.</p>
<p>Would they recognize him? The car was unmarked, and even Martin and
Goldberg were wearing coats and ties, and so they might pass for three
men who just happened to be coming to this building. On the other
hand…was he any longer just an anonymous functionary of the
criminal-justice system? Hardly. His picture (by luscious Lucy
Dellafloria) had appeared on television. His name had appeared in every
newspaper. They started walking up the alley between the police
barricades. Halfway there—Kramer felt let down. Not a tumble from this
huge twitching assembly of the New York press.</p>
<p>Then: “Hey, Kramer!” A voice over to his right. His heart leapt.
“Kramer!” His impulse was to turn and smile, but he fought it. Should he
just keep on walking and ignore it? No, he shouldn’t high-hat them,
should he?…So he turned toward the voice with a look of high seriousness
on his face.</p>
<p>Two voices at once:</p>
<p>“Hey, Kramer, you gonna—”</p>
<p>“What are the charges—”</p>
<p>“—talk to her?”</p>
<p>“—against her?”</p>
<p>He heard someone else saying: “Who is that?” And someone answering:
“That’s Larry Kramer. He’s the D.A. on this case.”</p>
<p>Kramer kept his lips set grimly and said, “I got nothing for you
right now, fellows.”</p>
<p>Fellows! They were his now, this bunch—the press, which was formerly
merely an abstraction so far as he was concerned. Now he was looking the
whole itchy mob of them in the face, and they hung on his every word,
his every step. One, two, three photographers were in position. He could
hear the whine of the rewind mechanisms of their cameras. A television
crew was lumbering over. A videocamera protruded from the skull of one
of them like a horn. Kramer walked a bit slower and stared at one of the
reporters, as if considering a reply, to give the fellows a few more
seconds of this solemn mug of his. (They were only doing their job.)</p>
<p>When he and Martin and Goldberg reached the front door, Kramer said
to the two doormen, with guttural authority: “Larry Kramer, Bronx
District Attorney’s Office. They’re expecting us.”</p>
<p>The doormen hopped to it.</p>
<p>Upstairs, the door to the apartment was opened by a little man in
uniform who appeared to be Indonesian or Korean. Kramer stepped
inside—and the sight dazzled him. This was to be expected, since it was
designed to dazzle people far more inured to luxury than Larry Kramer.
He glanced at Martin and Goldberg. The three of them were straightout
sightseers…the two-story ceiling, the enormous chandelier, the marble
staircase, the fluted pilasters, the silver, the balcony, the huge
paintings, the sumptuous frames, any one of which, just the frame, cost
about half a cop’s annual pay. Their eyes were gobbling it all up.</p>
<p>Kramer could hear a vacuum cleaner going somewhere upstairs. A maid
in a black uniform with a white apron appeared on the marble floor of
the entry gallery and then disappeared. The Oriental butler led them
across the gallery. Through a doorway they got an eyeful of a vast room
flooded with light from the tallest windows Kramer had ever seen in a
private home. They were as big as the windows in the courtrooms of the
island fortress. They looked out over the tops of the trees of Central
Park. The butler took them to a smaller, darker room next to it. Or it
was darker by comparison; in fact, a single tall window facing the park
admitted so much light that at first the two men and the woman who
waited inside were visible only as silhouettes. The two men were
standing. The woman sat in a chair. There was a set of rolling library
stairs, a large desk with gilded decorations on its curved legs, and
antique knickknacks on top of it, plus two small couches with a large
burled-wood coffee table between them, several armchairs and side tables
and…and this stuff.</p>
<p>One of the silhouettes stepped forward from out of the glare and
said, “Mr. Kramer? I’m Tucker Trigg.”</p>
<p>Tucker Trigg; that was the guy’s actual name. He was her lawyer, from
Curry, Goad andandandand Pesterall. Kramer had set up this meeting
through him. Tucker Trigg had a nasal honk Wasp voice that really put
Kramer off, but now that Kramer could see him, he didn’t look like his
idea of a Wasp. He was big, round, pudgy, like a football player gone to
fat. They shook hands, and Tucker Trigg said in his honk voice:</p>
<p>“Mr. Kramer, this is Mrs. Ruskin.”</p>
<p>She was seated in a high-backed armchair that made Kramer think of
one of those series on Masterpiece Theatre. There was a tall gray-haired
guy standing beside her. The widow—how young and bouncy she looked!
Foxy, Roland had said. Arthur Ruskin had had a lot on his hands,
seventy-one years old, with his second pacemaker ticking away. She wore
a plain black silk dress. The fact that the wide shoulders and cadet
collar treatment were currently quite chic was lost on Larry Kramer, but
her legs weren’t. Her legs were crossed. Kramer tried to keep his eyes
from running up the highlit curve of the top of her foot and the
glistening curve of her calves and the shimmering curve of her thighs
under the black silk. He tried his best. She had the most wonderful long
ivory neck, and her lips were parted slightly, and her dark eyes seemed
to be drinking his right up. He was flustered.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to intrude under these circumstances,” he stammered. He
immediately felt he had said something foolish. Was she supposed to
conclude that under other circumstances he would be happy to
intrude?</p>
<p>“Oh, I understand, Mr. Kramer,” she said softly, with a brave smile.
Oh, I unnerstin, Mr. Krimmuh. Or was it merely a brave smile? God
almighty, the way she looked at him!</p>
<p>He couldn’t imagine what to say to her next. Tucker Trigg spared him
the task by introducing the man who stood next to the chair. He was a
tall, older man. His gray hair was combed back smartly. He had the sort
of military posture seldom seen in New York. His name was Clifford
Priddy, and he was well known for defending prominent people in federal
criminal cases. This one had Wasp written all over him. He looked at you
straight down his long, thin nose. His clothes were subdued and rich, as
only these bastards knew how to do it. His shiny black shoes were
oh-so-sweetly fitted in the instep and trim in the toe. The man made
Kramer feel clumsy. His own shoes were heavy brown sloggers, with soles
that stuck out like rock ledges. Well, this case wasn’t in federal
court, where the old Ivy League network still looked out for its own.
No, they were dealing with the basic Bronx now.</p>
<p>“How do you do, Mr. Kramer,” said Mr. Clifford Priddy, affably.</p>
<p>“Fine,” said Kramer, shaking hands and thinking. Let’s see how smug
you look when we get you up to Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Then he introduced Martin and Goldberg, and everyone sat down. Martin
and Goldberg and Tucker Trigg and Clifford Priddy; there was a quartet
for you. Goldberg sat hunched over, a bit subdued, but Martin was still
the Tourist Unfazed. His eyes were dancing all over the room.</p>
<p>The young widow in black pressed a button on the table beside her
chair. She recrossed her legs. The curved sheens flew apart and
reassembled, and Kramer tried to avert his eyes. She looked toward the
doorway. A maid, a Filipino, if Kramer had to guess, was standing
there.</p>
<p>Maria Ruskin looked at Kramer and then Goldberg and Martin and said,
“Would you gentlemen care for some coffee?”</p>
<p>No one cared for coffee. She said, “Nora, I’d like some coffee,
and—”</p>
<p>“Cora,” the woman said tonelessly. Every head turned toward her, as
if she had just produced a revolver.</p>
<p>“—and bring some extra cups, please,” said the widow, ignoring the
correction, “in case any of the gentlemen change their mind.”</p>
<p>Not perfect with the grammar, thought Kramer. He tried to figure out
exactly what was wrong with what she had said—and then realized that
everyone was quiet and looking at him. Now it was his show. The widow’s
lips were parted in the same strange little smile. Was it bravery?
Mockery?</p>
<p>“Mrs. Ruskin,” he began, “as I say, I’m sorry to have to come to you
at this particular time, and I’m very grateful for your cooperation. I’m
sure Mr. Trigg and Mr. Priddy have explained to you the purpose of this
meeting, and I just, uh, want to—” She stirred her legs under her dress,
and Kramer tried not to notice the way her thighs welled up under the
shiny black silk. “—uh, emphasize that this case, which involves a very
serious injury, possibly fatal, to a young man, Henry Lamb—this case is
highly important to our office, because it’s highly important to the
people of Bronx County and to all the people of this city.” He paused.
He realized he was sounding pompous, but he didn’t know how to get back
down off his high horse. The presence of these Wasp lawyers and the
scale of this palace had made him get up here.</p>
<p>“I understand,” said the widow, possibly to help him out. Her head
was slightly cocked, and she smiled the smile of an intimate friend.
Kramer had rogue stirrings. His mind leapt ahead to the trial. Sometimes
you ended up working very closely with a cooperative witness.</p>
<p>“That’s why your cooperation would be of such great value to us.” He
threw his head back, to emphasize the grandeur of his
sternocleidomastoid muscles. “Now, all I want to do right now is to try
to explain to you what’s going to be involved if you do cooperate or if
for any reason you decide not to cooperate, because I think we have to
be completely clear on that. Certain things are gonna naturally flow
from either decision. Now, before we start, I should remind you that—”
He paused again. He had started the sentence off wrong and was going to
get tangled up in his syntax. Nothing to do but plow on. “—you’re
represented by eminent counsel, so I don’t have to remind you of your
rights in that respect.” In that respect. Why these pompous, pointless
block phrases? “But I am obliged to remind you of your right to remain
silent, should you want to for any reason.”</p>
<p>He looked at her and nodded, as if to say, “Is that clear?” She
nodded back, and he noticed the swell of her breasts moving under the
black silk.</p>
<p>From beside the chair he lifted his attaché case up to his lap and
immediately wished he didn’t have to. The case’s scuffed corners and
edges were an exposé of his lowly status. (A 6,000-a-year assistant D.A.
from the Bronx.) Look at the goddamned case! All dried out, cracked, and
scuffed! He felt humiliated. What was going through these fucking Wasps’
minds at this moment? Were they just holding back their smirks for
tactical reasons, or out of some condescending Wasp politeness?</p>
<p>From the case he took two pages of notes on yellow legal paper and a
folder full of Xeroxed material, including some newspaper clippings.
Then he closed up the telltale luggage and put it back on the floor.</p>
<p>He looked down at his notes. He looked up at Maria Ruskin. “There are
four persons known to have intimate knowledge of this case,” he said.
“One is the victim, Henry Lamb, who is in an apparently irreversible
coma. One is Mr. Sherman McCoy, who is charged with reckless
endangerment, leaving the scene of an accident, and failure to report an
accident. He denies these charges. One is an individual who was present
when the incident occurred and who has come forth and has positively
identified Mr. McCoy as the driver of the car that struck Mr. Lamb. This
witness has told us that Mr. McCoy was accompanied in that car by
another person, a white female in her twenties, and the information
provided makes her his accomplice in one or more of the felonies that
Mr. McCoy is charged with.” He paused, for what he hoped would be
maximum effect. “That witness has positively identified that woman
as…yourself.”</p>
<p>Kramer now stopped and looked the widow squarely in the face. At
first she was perfection. She didn’t blink. Her lovely brave little
smile never wavered. But then her Adam’s apple, almost imperceptibly,
went up and down just once.</p>
<p>She swallowed!</p>
<p>An excellent feeling came over Kramer, in every cell and every neural
fiber. In that instant, the instant of that little swallow, his scuffed
attaché case meant nothing, nor did his clodhopper shoes nor his cheap
suit nor his measly salary nor his New York accent nor his barbarisms
and solecisms of speech. For in that moment he had something that these
Wasp counselors, these immaculate Wall Street partners from the universe
of the Currys andandandand Goads andandandand Pesteralls andandandand
Dunnings andandandand Spongets andandandand Leaches would never know and
never feel the inexpressible pleasure of possessing. And they would
remain silent and polite in the face of it, as they were right now, and
they would swallow with fear when and if their time came. And he now
understood what it was that gave him a momentary lift each morning as he
saw the island fortress rise at the crest of the Grand Concourse from
the gloom of the Bronx. For it was nothing less than the Power, the same
Power to which Abe Weiss himself was totally given over. It was the
power of the government over the freedom of its subjects. To think of it
in the abstract made it seem so theoretical and academic, but to feel
it—to see the looks on their faces—as they stare back at you, courier
and conduit of the Power—Arthur Rivera, Jimmy Dollard, Herbert 92X, and
the guy called Pimp—even them—and now to see that little swallow of
fright in a perfect neck worth millions—well, the poet has never sung of
that ecstasy or even dreamed of it, and no prosecutor, no judge, no cop,
no income-tax auditor will ever enlighten him, for we dare not even
mention it to one another, do we?—and yet we feel it and we know it
every time they look at us with those eyes that beg for mercy or, if not
mercy, Lord, dumb luck or capricious generosity. (Just one break!) What
are all the limestone façades of Fifth Avenue and all the marble halls
and stuffed-leather libraries and all the riches of Wall Street in the
face of my control of your destiny and your helplessness in the face of
the Power?</p>
<p>Kramer stretched that moment out for as long as the bounds of logic
and minimal decency would allow and then just a little bit longer. None
of them, not the two immaculate Wasp lawyers from Wall Street and not
the beautiful young widow with her new millions, dared make a peep.</p>
<p>Then he said softly, paternally, “All right. Now let’s see what that
means.”</p>
<p>When Sherman entered Killian’s office, Killian said, “Ayyyyyy,
whaddaya whaddaya? What’s the long face for? You won’t mind coming all
the way down here when I tell you why. Dja think I brought you down here
to show you this?”</p>
<p>He tossed The City Light over to the edge of the desk. FINANCIER’S
WIDOW…Sherman barely glanced at it. It had already come humming and
sizzling into the arcade.</p>
<p>“He was right there in the room at Burns’s. This Peter Fallow. I
never saw him.”</p>
<p>“It don’t matter,” said Killian, who was in a jolly mood. “This is
old news. We awready knew this. Am I right? I brought you down here for
the news.”</p>
<p>The truth was, Sherman didn’t mind these trips down to Reade Street
at all. Sitting in the apartment…waiting for the next telephoned
threat…The very grandeur of the apartment mocked what he had now been
reduced to. He sat there and waited for the next blow. Doing anything
was preferable. Riding in a car to Reade Street, moving horizontally
without resistance—swell! Terrific!</p>
<p>Sherman sat down, and Killian said, “I didn’t want to even mention
this over the telephone, but I got a very interesting telephone call.
The jackpot, in fact.”</p>
<p>Sherman just looked at him.</p>
<p>“Maria Ruskin,” said Killian.</p>
<p>“You’re kidding.”</p>
<p>“That I wouldn’t kid you about.”</p>
<p>“Maria called you?”</p>
<p>“‘Mistuh Killyun, muh nim is Muhreeuh Ruskin. Uhm a frin uvuh client
uh yuhs, Mistuh Shuhmun McCoy.’ Does that sound like the correct
party?”</p>
<p>“My God! What did she say? What did she want?”</p>
<p>“She wants to see you.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be damned…”</p>
<p>“She wants to see you this afternoon at four-thirty. She said you’d
know where.”</p>
<p>“I’ll…be…damned…You know, she told me yesterday, at Burns’s, she was
going to call me. But I didn’t believe that for a second. Did she say
why?”</p>
<p>“No, and I didn’t ask her. I didn’t want to say one word that might
make her change her mind. All I said was, I was sure you’d be there. And
I’m sure you will be, bro.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you she’d call me?”</p>
<p>“You did? You just said you didn’t believe she would.”</p>
<p>“I know. Yesterday I didn’t, because she’s been avoiding me. But
didn’t I say she wasn’t the cautious type? She’s a gambler. She’s not
the type to play it safe. She likes to mix it up, and her game is—well,
it’s men. Your game is the law, mine is investments, hers is men.”</p>
<p>Killian started chuckling, more at the change in Sherman’s spirits
than anything else. “Okay,” he said, “terrific. Let’s you and her play.
Let’s get started. I had another reason for bringing you down here
instead of me coming up to your place. We got to get you wired.”</p>
<p>He pressed a button and said into the intercom: “Nina? Tell Ed
Quigley to come in here.”</p>
<p>At precisely 4:30, with his heart pumping away at a good clip,
Sherman pressed the bell marked “4B Boll.” She must have been waiting by
the intercom box—the intercom itself no longer worked—because right away
he could hear a buzz in the door and the heavy click-click-click of the
electric lock opening, and he entered the town house. The smell was
instantly familiar, the dead air, the filthy carpet on the stairs. There
was the same old lugubrious paint and battered doorways and the dismal
light—familiar and at the same time new and dreadful, as if he had never
taken the trouble to notice what was really here. The wonderful bohemian
spell of the place was broken. He now had the misfortune to gaze at an
erotic dream with the eyes of a realist. How could he ever have found it
enchanting?</p>
<p>The creak of the stairs reminded him of things he wanted to forget.
He could still see the dachshund hauling his fat tube up the
risers…“You’re a wet little piece a salami, Muhshull”…And he had been
sweating…Sweating, he had made three trips up this decrepit staircase
carrying Maria’s luggage…And now he carried the heaviest burden of all.
I’m wired. He could feel the tape deck in the small of his back the
microphone over his sternum; he could feel, or he imagined he felt, the
grip of the tape that held the wire to his body. Each of these artful,
stealthy, miniaturized elements seemed to grow with each step he took.
His skin magnified them, like a tongue feeling a broken tooth. Surely
they were obvious! How much of it showed on his face? How much deceit?
How much dishonor?</p>
<p>He sighed and discovered he was already sweating and panting, from
the climb or from adrenaline or from funk. The heat of his body made the
tape prickly—or was it his imagination?</p>
<p>By the time he reached the door, that sad painted door, he was
breathing hard. He paused, sighed again, then rapped on the door with
the signal they had always used, tap tappa tap tap—tap tap.</p>
<p>The door opened slowly, but there was no one there. Then—</p>
<p>“Boo!” Her head popped out from behind the door, and she was grinning
at him. “Scare yuh?”</p>
<p>“Not really,” said Sherman. “Lately I’ve been scared by experts.”</p>
<p>She laughed, and it seemed to be a genuine laugh. “You, too? We’re a
pair, aren’t we, Sherman?” With that she held out her arms to him, the
way you would for a welcoming embrace.</p>
<p>Sherman stared at her, astonished, confused, paralyzed. The
calculations running through his mind faster than he could deal with
them. There she was, in a black silk dress, her widow’s weeds, fitted
closely at the waist, so that her gorgeous body welled out above and
below. Her eyes were large and brilliant. Her dark hair was perfection
itself, with a luxurious sheen. Her coyly curved lips, which had always
driven him crazy, were full and parted and smiling. But it added up to
nothing but a certain arrangement of clothes and flesh and hair. There
was a slight furze of dark hair on her forearms. He should slip between
those arms and embrace her, if that’s what she wanted! It was a delicate
moment! He needed her on his side, in his confidence, for however long
it took to get certain matters of fact into the microphone over his
sternum and onto the tape in the small of his back! A delicate
moment—and a dreadful dilemma! Suppose he embraced her—and she felt the
microphone—or ran her hands down his back! He had never considered such
a thing, not for a moment. (Who would even want to embrace a man who was
wired?) Nevertheless—do something!</p>
<p>So, he moved toward her, thrusting his shoulders forward and humping
his back, so that she couldn’t possibly flatten herself against his
chest. Thus they embraced, a voluptuous supple young thing and a
mysterious cripple.</p>
<p>Quickly he disengaged, trying to smile, and she looked at him, as if
to see if he was all right.</p>
<p>“You’re right, Maria. We are a pair, we’re on the front page.” He
smiled philosophically. (So let’s get down to cases!) Nervously he
looked about the room. “Come on,” she said, “sit down.” She gestured
toward the oak pedestal table. “I’ll get you a drink. What would you
like?”</p>
<p>Fine; let’s sit down and talk. “Any scotch?”</p>
<p>She went into the kitchen, and he looked down at his chest to make
sure the microphone didn’t show. He tried to run over the questions in
his mind. He wondered if the tape was still running.</p>
<p>Presently she returned with his drink and one for herself, a clear
drink, gin or vodka. She sat down in the other bentwood chair and
crossed her legs, her glistening legs, and smiled.</p>
<p>She raised her glass as if in a toast. He did the same.</p>
<p>“So here we are, Sherman, the couple all New York is talking about.
There’s a lotta people’d like to hear this conversation.”</p>
<p>Sherman’s heart jumped. He was dying to peek downward to see if his
microphone was showing. Was she insinuating something? He studied her
face. He couldn’t make out a thing.</p>
<p>“Yes, here we are,” he said. “To tell you the truth, I thought you’d
decided to vanish on me. I haven’t had a very pleasant time since you
left.”</p>
<p>“Sherman, I swear to you I didn’t know anything about it until I got
back.”</p>
<p>“But you didn’t even tell me you were going.”</p>
<p>“I know, but that had nothing to do with you, Sherman. I was—I was
half crazy.”</p>
<p>“What did it have to do with?” He tilted his head and smiled, to show
he wasn’t bitter.</p>
<p>“With Arthur.”</p>
<p>“Ah. With Arthur.”</p>
<p>“Yes, with Arthur. You think I had a very free-and-easy arrangement
with Arthur, and in a way I did, but I also had to live with him, and
nothing was really free with Arthur. He took it out one way or the
other. I told you how he’d started swearing at me.”</p>
<p>“You mentioned it.”</p>
<p>“Calling me a whore and a bitch, right in front of the servants or
anybody else, if he felt like it. Such resentment, Sherman! Arthur
wanted a young wife, and then he turned around and hated me because I
was young and he was an old man. He wanted exciting people around,
because he thought with all his money, he deserved exciting people, and
then he turned around and he hated them and he hated me, because they
were my friends or else they were more interested in me than they were
in him. The only people interested in Arthur were those old yids, like
Ray Radosz. I hope you saw what a fool he made of himself at the
funeral. Then he came in the back there and started trying to hug me. I
thought he was gonna pull my dress off me. Did you see that? You were so
excited! I kept trying to tell you to calm down! I never saw you like
that. And that big-nosed bastard from The City Light, that horrible
hypocritical Brit, was standing right behind you. He heard you!”</p>
<p>“I know I was excited,” he said. “I thought you were ducking me. I
was afraid it was the last chance I was going to have to talk to
you.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t ducking you, Sherman. I’m trying to explain. The only
person I was ducking was Arthur. I just left, I just—I didn’t think. I
just left. I went to Como, but I knew he could find me there. So I went
to visit Isabel di Nodino. She has a place in the mountains, in a little
town outside of Como. It’s like a castle in a book. It was wonderful. No
telephone calls. I didn’t even see a newspaper.”</p>
<p>All alone, except for Filippo Chirazzi. But that didn’t matter,
either. As calmly as he could, he said, “It’s nice that you could get
away, Maria. But you knew I was worried. You knew about the piece in the
newspaper, because I showed it to you.” He couldn’t get the agitation
out of his voice. “The night that big maniac was here—I know you
remember that.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Sherman. You’re getting all worked up again.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever been arrested?” he said.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Well, I have. That was one of the things I did while you were away.
I…” He stopped, suddenly realizing he was doing something very foolish.
To get her frightened about the prospects of being arrested was the last
thing he needed to do right now. So he shrugged and smiled and said,
“Well, it’s an experience,” as if to say, “But not as bad as you might
think.”</p>
<p>“But I’ve been threatened with it,” she said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“A man from the Bronx District Attorney’s Office came Ground to see
me today, with two detectives.”</p>
<p>This hit Sherman like a jolt. “He did?”</p>
<p>“A pompous little bastard. He thought he was being so tough. He kept
throwing his head back and doing something weird with his neck, like
this, and looking at me through these little slits for eyes. What a
creep.”</p>
<p>“What did you tell him?” Very nervous now.</p>
<p>“Nothing. He was too busy telling me what he could do to me.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” A riff of panic.</p>
<p>“He told me about this witness he has. He was so pompous and official
about it. He wouldn’t even say who it was, but it was obviously that
other kid, the big one. I can’t tell you what a jerk this man was.”</p>
<p>“Was his name Kramer?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. That was it.”</p>
<p>“He was the same one who was in court when I was arraigned.”</p>
<p>“He made it real simple, Sherman. He said if I would testify against
you and corroborate the other witness, he’d give me immunity. If I
didn’t, then I’d be treated as an accomplice, and they’d charge me with
these…felonies. I can’t even remember what they were.”</p>
<p>“But surely—”</p>
<p>“He even gave me these Xeroxes of stories in the newspapers. He
practically drew me a map. These were the correct stories, and these
were the ones you concocted. I’m supposed to agree with the correct
stories. If I say what actually happened, I go to prison.”</p>
<p>“But surely you told him what actually happened!”</p>
<p>“I didn’t tell him anything. I wanted to talk to you first.”</p>
<p>He was sitting on the edge of the chair. “But, Maria, certain things
are so clear-cut about this thing, and they don’t even know them yet.
They’ve only heard lies from this kid who was trying to rob us! For
example, it didn’t happen on a street, it happened on a ramp, right? And
we stopped because the road was blocked, before we even saw anybody.
Right? Isn’t that right?” He realized his voice had risen.</p>
<p>A warm, sad smile, the sort of smile you give people who are in pain,
came over Maria’s face, and she stood up and put her hands on her hips
and said, “Sherman, Sherman, Sherman, what are we gonna do with
you?”</p>
<p>She slewed her right foot out in a certain way she had and let it
pivot for a moment on the heel of her black high-heeled shoe. She gave
him a look with her big brown eyes and held out her hands toward him,
palms up.</p>
<p>“Come here, Sherman.”</p>
<p>“Maria—this is important!”</p>
<p>“I know it is. Just come here.”</p>
<p>Christ! She wanted to embrace him again! Well—embrace her, you idiot!
It’s a sign she wants to be on your side! Embrace her within an inch of
your life! Yes!—but how? I’m wired up! A cartridge of shame on my chest!
A bomb of dishonor in the small of my back! What’ll she want to do next?
Flop on the bed? What then? Well—good God, man! The look on her face
says, “I’m yours!” She’s your ticket out! Don’t blow this chance! Do
something! Act!</p>
<p>So he rose from the chair. He lurched toward the best of both worlds.
He got into a crouch, so that her chest wouldn’t touch his, so the small
of his back would be beyond the reach of her hands. He embraced her like
an old man leaning over a fence to touch a flagpole. This brought his
head down low. His chin was practically on her clavicle.</p>
<p>“Sherman,” she said, “what’s wrong? What’s wrong with your back?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“You’re all hunched over.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” He turned sideways, with his arms still around her
shoulders. He tried to embrace her sideways.</p>
<p>“Sherman!” She stepped back for a moment. “You’re all bent sideways.
What’s the matter? You don’t want me to touch you?”</p>
<p>“No! No…I guess I’m just tense. You don’t know what I’ve been
through.” He decided to improve on that. “You don’t know how much I’ve
missed you, how much I’ve needed you.”</p>
<p>She studied him, then gave him the warmest, wettest, most labial look
imaginable. “Well,” she said, “here I am.”</p>
<p>She stepped toward him. He was in for it now. No more crouching, you
dolt! No more sidewinding! He’d have to take a chance! Maybe the
microphone was down deep enough so that she wouldn’t feel it, especially
if he kissed her—kissed her feverishly! Her arms would be around his
neck. So long as she kept them there, she’d never get to the small of
his back. They were just inches apart. He slipped his arms under hers,
in order to force hers up around his neck. He embraced her around her
shoulder blades, to keep them forced up high. Awkward, but it would have
to do.</p>
<p>“Oh, Maria.” This kind of passionate moan wasn’t typical of him, but
it would have to do also.</p>
<p>He kissed her. He closed his eyes in the interest of sincerity and
concentrated on bracing his arms up high on her torso. He was conscious
of flesh slightly caked with lipstick and warm saliva and the smell of
her breath, which bore the recycled vegetable smell of gin.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. What the hell was she doing? She was sliding her arms
down outside of his arms, down toward his hips! He raised his elbows and
tensed the muscles of his upper arms to try to force her arms away from
his body without making an obvious point of it. Too late! She had her
hands on his hips, trying to press his hips against hers. But her arms
weren’t long enough! Suppose her hands then edged up to the small of his
back. He jutted his tail out. If her fingers lost contact with his hips,
maybe she’d give up. Her fingers—where were they? For a moment he felt
nothing. Then—something on his waist, on the side. Shit! Confuse
her—that was his only chance. Her lips remained pressed against his. She
squirmed rhythmically and passionately amid the high vegetable funk. He
squirmed back and jiggled his hips a bit, to throw her off. Her
fingers—he’d lost them again. Every nerve fiber was on red alert,
seeking to detect their presence. All at once her lips stopped
squirming. Their lips were still together, but the motor had cut out.
She disengaged her mouth and pulled her head back a few inches, so that
he saw three eyes swimming in front of his face. But her arms were still
around him. He didn’t like the way those three eyes swam.</p>
<p>“Sherman…What’s this on your back?”</p>
<p>“My back?” He tried to move, but she stayed with him. Her arms were
still around him.</p>
<p>“There’s a lump, a piece a metal or something—this thing, on your
back.”</p>
<p>Now he could feel the pressure of her hand. It was right on top of
the tape deck! He tried a little turn this way and a little turn that
way, but she still had her hand on it. He tried a real shimmy. No use!
Now she had a grip on it!</p>
<p>“Sherman, what is this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. My belt—my belt buckle—I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have a belt buckle in the back!”</p>
<p>Now she pulled loose from him in front, but she still had her hand on
the deck.</p>
<p>“Maria! What the hell!”</p>
<p>He swung to the side in an arc, but she swung around behind him like
a college wrestler looking for a takedown. He got a glimpse of her face.
Halfa smile—half a furious scowl—an ugly dawn breaking.</p>
<p>He spun and broke free. She confronted him head on.</p>
<p>“Sherman!” Shuhmun. A quizzical smile, waiting for the right instant
to break into a howl of accusation. Slowly: “I want to know…what’s’at on
your back.”</p>
<p>“For God’s sake, Maria. What’s gotten into you? It’s nothing. My
suspender buttons maybe—I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“I want to see, Sherman.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, see?”</p>
<p>“Take off your jacket.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Take it off. I want to see.”</p>
<p>“That’s crazy.”</p>
<p>“You’ve taken off a lot more than that in here, Sherman.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Maria, you’re being silly.”</p>
<p>“Then humor me. Let me see what’s on your back.”</p>
<p>A plea: “Maria, come on. It’s too late in the day to play games.”</p>
<p>She came toward him, the terrible smile still on her face. She was
going to see for herself! He jumped to one side. She came after him. He
dodged again.</p>
<p>A would-be game-like giggle: “What are you doing, Maria!”</p>
<p>Beginning to breathe heavily: “We’ll see!” She charged at him. He
couldn’t get out of the way. Her hands were on his chest—trying to get
at his shirt! He covered himself like a maiden.</p>
<p>“Maria!”</p>
<p>The howl began: “You’re hiding something, aren’t you!”</p>
<p>“Now just hold on…”</p>
<p>“You’re hiding something! Whaddaya got under your shirt!”</p>
<p>She lunged at him again. He dodged, but before he knew it, she was
behind him. She had her hands under his jacket. She had a grip on the
tape deck, although it was still under his shirt, and his shirt was
still tucked into his pants. He could feel it coming away from his
back.</p>
<p>“And a wire, Sherman!”</p>
<p>He clamped down on her hand with his own, to keep her from pulling it
out. But her hand was under his jacket, and his hand was on top of the
jacket. He began hopping around, holding on to this writhing red-angry
mass under his jacket.</p>
<p>“It’s—on—a—wire—you—bastard!”</p>
<p>The words were squirting out in awful grunts as the two of them
hopped about. Only the exertion kept her from screaming bloody
murder.</p>
<p>Now he had her hand by the wrist. He had to make her let go. He
squeezed harder and harder.</p>
<p>“You’re—hurting me!”</p>
<p>He squeezed harder.</p>
<p>She gave a little shriek and let go. For a moment he was paralyzed by
the fury in her face.</p>
<p>“Sherman—you rotten, dishonest bastard!”</p>
<p>“Maria, I swear—”</p>
<p>“You—swear, do yuh!” She lunged again. He bolted for the door. She
grabbed one sleeve and the back of his jacket. He tried to wrench free.
The sleeve began tearing away from the body. He plowed on toward the
door. He could feel the tape deck bouncing on his buttocks. It was
hanging out of his pants by now, out from under the shirt and hanging
off his body by the wire.</p>
<p>Then there was a blur of black silk and a thud. Maria was on the
floor. One of her high heels had buckled and her legs went out from
under her. Sherman ran to the door. It was all he could do to open it,
because his jacket was pulled down over his arms.</p>
<p>Now he was out into the hallway. He heard Maria sobbing, and then she
yelled out:</p>
<p>“That’s right, run! Drag your tail between your legs!”</p>
<p>It was true. He was hobbling down the stairs with the tape deck
dangling ignominiously down his backside. He felt more shameful than any
dog.</p>
