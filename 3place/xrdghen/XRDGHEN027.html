<h4 id="hero-of-the-hive">27. Hero of the Hive</h4>
<p>The demonstrators vanished as rapidly as they had arrived. The death
threats ceased. But for how long? Sherman now had to balance the fear of
death against the horror of going broke. He compromised. Two days after
the demonstration he cut the number of bodyguards down to two, one for
the apartment and one for his parents’ house.</p>
<p>Nevertheless—hemorrhaging money! Two bodyguards on duty around the
clock, at twenty-five dollars per hour per man, a total of ,200 a
day—38,000 per year—bleeding to death!</p>
<p>Two days after that, he got up the nerve to keep an engagement Judy
had made almost a month before: dinner at the di Duccis’.</p>
<p>True to her word, Judy had been doing what she could to help him.
Equally true to her word, this did not include being affectionate. She
was like one asphalt contractor forced into an alliance with another by
some sordid turn of fate…Better than nothing perhaps…It was in that
spirit that the two of them planned their return to Society.</p>
<p>Their thinking (McCoy andandandand McCoy Associates’) was that the
long story in the Daily News by Killian’s man Flannagan offered a
blameless explanation of the McCoy Case. Therefore, why should they
hide? Shouldn’t they go through the motions of a normal life, and the
more publicly the better?</p>
<p>But would le monde—and, more specifically, the very social di
Duccis—see it that way? With the di Duccis they at least had a fighting
chance. Silvio di Ducci, who had lived in New York since he was
twenty-one, was the son of an Italian brake shoe manufacturer. His wife,
Kate, had been born and reared in San Marino, California; he was her
third wealthy husband. Judy was the decorator who had done their
apartment. She now took the precaution of ringing up and offering to
back out of the dinner party. “Don’t you dare!” said Kate di Ducci. “I’m
counting on your coming!” This gave Judy a terrific lift. Sherman could
read it in her face. It did nothing for him, however. His depression and
skepticism were too profound for a polite boost from the likes of Kate
di Ducci. All he could manage to say to Judy was, “We’ll see, won’t
we.”</p>
<p>The bodyguard at the apartment, Occhioni, drove the Mercury station
wagon over to his parents’ house, picked up Judy, returned to Park
Avenue, and picked up Sherman. They headed for the di Duccis’ on Fifth
Avenue. Sherman pulled the revolver of his Resentment out of his
waistband and braced for the worst. The di Duccis and the Bavardages ran
with precisely the same crowd (the same vulgar non-Knickerbocker crowd).
At the Bavardages’ they had frozen him out even when his respectability
was intact. With their combination of rudeness, crudeness, cleverness,
and chic, what would they inflict upon him now? He told himself that he
was long past caring whether they approved of him or not. His
intention—their intention (McCoy andandandand McCoy’s)—was to show the
world that, being without sin, they could proceed with their lives. His
great fear was of the sort of outcome that would prove them wrong:
namely, an ugly scene.</p>
<p>The di Duccis’ entry gallery had none of the dazzle of the
Bavardages’. Instead of Ronald Vine’s clever combinations of materials,
of silk and hemp and gilt wood and upholsterer’s webbing, the di Duccis’
betrayed Judy’s weakness for the solemn and grand: marble, fluted
pilasters, huge classical cornices. Yet it was every bit as much from
another century (the eighteenth), and it was filled with the same
clusters of social X-rays, Lemon Tarts, and men with dark neckties; the
same grins, the same laughter, the same 300-watt eyes, the same sublime
burble and ecstatic rat-tat-tat-tat chatter. In short, the hive. The
hive!—the hive!—the familiar buzz closed in about Sherman, but it no
longer resonated in his bones. He listened to it, wondering if his
tainted presence would stop the hive’s very hum in mid-sentence,
mid-grin, mid-guffaw.</p>
<p>An emaciated woman emerged from the clusters and came toward them,
smiling…Emaciated but absolutely beautiful…He had never seen a more
beautiful face…Her pale golden hair was swept back. She had a high
forehead and a face as white and smooth as china, and yet with large,
lively eyes and a mouth with a sensual—no, more than that—a provocative
smile. Very provocative! When she grasped his forearm, he felt a tingle
in his loins.</p>
<p>“Judy! Sherman!”</p>
<p>Judy embraced the woman. In all sincerity she said, “Oh, Kate, you’re
so kind. You’re so wonderful.” Kate di Ducci hooked her arm inside
Sherman’s and drew him toward her, so that the three of them formed a
sandwich, Kate di Ducci between the two McCoys.</p>
<p>“You’re more than kind,” said Sherman. “You’re brave.” All at once he
realized he was using the sort of intimate baritone he used when he
wanted to get the old game going.</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly!” said Kate di Ducci. “If you hadn’t come, both of
you, I’d have been very, very cross! Come over here, I want you to meet
some people.”</p>
<p>Sherman noticed with trepidation that she was leading them toward a
conversational bouquet dominated by the tall patrician figure of
Nunnally Voyd, the novelist who had been at the Bavardages’. An X-ray
and two men with navy suits, white shirts, and navy ties were beaming
great social grins at the great author. Kate di Ducci made the
introductions, then led Judy out of the entry gallery, into the grand
salon.</p>
<p>Sherman held his breath, ready for an affront or, at best, ostracism.
Instead, all four kept smiling mightily.</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. McCoy,” said Nunnally Voyd with a mid-Atlantic accent, “I
must tell you, I’ve thought about you more than once over the past few
days. Welcome to the legion of the damned…now that you’ve been properly
devoured by the fruit flies.”</p>
<p>“The fruit flies?”</p>
<p>“The press. I’m amused by all the soul-searching these…insects do.
‘Are we too aggressive, too cold-blooded, too heartless?’—as if the
press were a rapacious beast, a tiger. I think they’d like to be thought
of as bloodthirsty. That’s what I call praise by faint damnation.
They’ve got the wrong animal. In fact, they’re fruit flies. Once they
get the scent, they hover, they swarm. If you swing your hand at them,
they don’t bite it, they dart for cover, and as soon as your head is
turned, they’re back again. They’re fruit flies. But I’m sure I don’t
have to tell you that.”</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this grand literatus was using his predicament
as a pedestal upon which to place this entomological conceit, this set
piece that came out a bit shopworn in the delivery, Sherman was
grateful. In some way Voyd was, indeed, a brother, a fellow legionnaire.
He seemed to recall—he had never paid much attention to literary
gossip—that Voyd had been stigmatized as homosexual or bisexual. There
had been some sort of highly publicized squabble…How very unjust! How
dare these…insects pester this man who, while perhaps a bit affected,
had such largeness of spirit, such sensitivity to the human condition?
What if he was…gay? The very word gay popped into Sherman’s head
spontaneously. (Yes, it is true. A liberal is a conservative who has
been arrested.)</p>
<p>Emboldened by his new brother, Sherman told of how the horse-faced
woman had shoved a microphone in his face as he and Campbell left the
apartment building and how he had swung his arm, purely to get the
device out of his face—and the woman was now suing him! She was crying,
pouting, whimpering—and filing a civil suit for 00,000!</p>
<p>Everyone in the bouquet, even Voyd himself, was looking directly at
him, absorbed, beaming a social grin.</p>
<p>“Sherman! Sherman! Goddamn!” A booming voice…He looked around…A huge
young man coming toward him…Bobby Shaflett…He had broken off from
another bouquet and was coming toward him with a big barnyard grin on
his face. He held out his hand, and Sherman shook it, and the Golden
Hillbilly sang out, “You sure have been making the feathers fly since
the last time I saw you! You sure as hell have, godalmighty dog!”</p>
<p>Sherman didn’t know what to say. As it turned out, he didn’t have to
say a thing.</p>
<p>“I got arrested in Montreal last year,” said the Towheaded Tenor with
evident satisfaction. “You probably saw something about that.”</p>
<p>“Well, no…I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t?”</p>
<p>“No—why on earth—what were you arrested for?”</p>
<p>“PEEING ON A TREE!” Haw haw haw haw haw haw haw haw haw haw! “They
don’t cotton to it when you pee on their trees at midnight in Montreal,
leastways not right outside the hotel!” Haw haw haw haw haw haw haw haw
haw haw!</p>
<p>Sherman stared at his beaming face with consternation.</p>
<p>“They threw me in jail! Indecent exposure! PEEING ON A TREE!” Haw haw
haw haw haw haw haw haw! He calmed down a bit. “You know,” he said, “I
never was in jail before. What’d you think a jail?”</p>
<p>“Not much,” said Sherman.</p>
<p>“I know what you mean,” said Shaflett, “but it wudd’n so awful. I’d
heard all this stuff about what the other prisoners do to you in jail?”
He enunciated this as if it were a question. Sherman nodded. “You wanna
know what they did to me?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“They gave me apples!”</p>
<p>“Apples?”</p>
<p>“Sure did. The first meal I got in’eh, it was so bad I couldn’t eat
it—and I like to eat! All’s I could eat was this apple that came with
it. So you know what? The word got out that all’s I’d eat was the apple,
and they all sent me their apples, all the other prisoners. They passed
’em along, hand over hand, through the bars, till they got to me. By the
time I got outta there, there was just my head stickin’ out of a pile of
apples!” Haw haw haw haw haw haw haw haw haw haw haw!</p>
<p>Encouraged by this favorable gloss put upon jail time, Sherman told
of the Puerto Rican in the holding pen who had seen the television crews
filming him in handcuffs and wanted to know what he had been arrested
for. He told of how his answer, “Reckless endangerment,” had obviously
disappointed the man and how, therefore, he told the next questioner,
“Manslaughter.” (The black youth with the shaved head…He felt a twinge
of the original terror…This he did not mention.) Eagerly they stared at
him, the entire bouquet—his bouquet—the renowned Bobby Shaflett and the
renowned Nunnally Voyd, as well as the other three social souls. Their
expressions were so rapt, so deliriously expectant! Sherman felt an
irresistible urge to improve upon his war story. So he invented a third
cellmate. And when this cellmate asked him what he was in for, he said,
“Second-degree murder.”</p>
<p>“I was running out of felonies,” said the adventurer, Sherman
McCoy.</p>
<p>Haw haw haw haw haw haw haw haw, went Bobby Shaflett.</p>
<p>Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho, went Nunnally Voyd.</p>
<p>Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah, went the X-ray and the two men in navy
suits.</p>
<p>Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh, went Sherman McCoy, as if his
time in the holding pen had amounted to nothing more than a war story in
the life of a man.</p>
<p>The di Duccis’ dining room, like the Bavardages’, featured a pair of
round tables, and at the center of each table was a creation by Huck
Thigg, the florist. For this night he had created a pair of miniature
trees, no more than fifteen inches high, out of hardened wisteria vines.
Glued to the branches of the trees were scores of brilliant blue dried
cornflowers. Each tree was set in a meadow, about a foot square, of
living buttercups sown so thick they touched. Around each meadow was a
miniature split-rail fence made of yew wood. This time, however, Sherman
had no opportunity to study the artistry of the celebrated young
Mr. Thigg. Far from being stumped for a conversational mate, he now
commanded an entire section of the table. To his immediate left was a
renowned social X-ray named Red Pitt, known sotto voce as the Bottomless
Pitt, because she was so superbly starved that her glutei maximi and the
surrounding tissue—in the vulgate, her ass—appeared to have vanished
altogether. You could have dropped a plumb line from the small of her
back to the floor. To her left was Nunnally Voyd, and to his left was a
Real-Estate X-ray named Lily Bradshaw. Sitting on Sherman’s right was a
Lemon Tart named Jacqueline Balch, the blond third wife of Knobby Balch,
heir to the Colonaid indigestion-remedy fortune. To her right was none
other than Baron Hochswald, and to his right was Kate di Ducci. During
much of the dinner all six of these men and women were tuned in solely
to Mr. Sherman McCoy. Crime, Economics, God, Freedom,
Immortality—whatever McCoy of the McCoy Case cared to talk about, the
table listened, even such an accomplished, egotistical, and ceaseless
talker as Nunnally Voyd.</p>
<p>Voyd said he had been surprised to learn that such vast amounts of
money could be made in bonds—and Sherman realized that Killian was
right: the press had created the impression that he was a titan of
finance.</p>
<p>“Frankly,” said Voyd, “I’ve always thought of the bond business
as…ummmmm…rather poky stuff.”</p>
<p>Sherman found himself smiling the wry smile of those who know a big
luscious secret. “Ten years ago,” he said, “you’d have been right. They
used to call us ‘the bond bores.’” He smiled again. “I haven’t heard
that for a long time. Today I suppose there’s five times as much money
changing hands in bonds as in stocks.” He turned toward Hochswald, who
was leaning forward to follow the conversation. “Wouldn’t you say so,
Baron?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, yes,” said the old man, “I expect that’s so.” And then the
baron shut up—in order to hear what Mr. McCoy had to say.</p>
<p>“All the takeovers, buy-outs, mergers—all done with bonds,” said
Sherman. “The national debt? A trillion dollars? What do you think that
is? All bonds. Every time interest rates fluctuate—up or down, it
doesn’t matter—little crumbs fall off all the bonds and lodge in the
cracks in the sidewalk.” He paused and smiled confidently…and
wondered…Why had he used this hateful phrase of Judy’s?…He chuckled and
said, “The important thing is not to stick your nose up at those crumbs,
because there are billions and billions and billions of them. At Pierce
andandandand Pierce, believe me, we sweep them up very diligently.”
We!—at Pierce andandandand Pierce! Even the little Tart on his right,
Jacqueline Balch, nodded at all this as if she understood.</p>
<p>Red Pitt, who prided herself on her bluntness, said, “Tell me,
Mr. McCoy, tell me—well, I’m going to come right out and ask you: What
did happen up there in the Bronx?”</p>
<p>Now they all leaned forward and stared, enthralled, at Sherman.</p>
<p>Sherman smiled. “My lawyer says I mustn’t say a word about what
happened.” Then he leaned forward himself and looked to his right and
then to his left and said, “But, strictly entre nous, it was a robbery
attempt. It was literally highway robbery.”</p>
<p>They were now all leaning forward so far it became a huddle around
Huck Thigg’s wisteria tree in the buttercup meadow.</p>
<p>Kate di Ducci said, “Why can’t you come out and say so, Sherman?”</p>
<p>“That I can’t go into, Kate. But I will tell you one other thing: I
didn’t hit anybody with my car.”</p>
<p>None of them said a word. They were spellbound. Sherman glanced at
Judy at the other table. Four people, two on either side, including
their vulpine little host, Silvio di Ducci, were honed in on her. McCoy
andandandand McCoy. Sherman pressed on:</p>
<p>“I can offer you some very sound advice. Don’t ever…get caught up…in
the criminal-justice system…in this city. As soon as you’re caught in
the machinery, just the machinery, you’ve lost. The only question
remaining is how much you’re going to lose. Once you enter a cell—even
before you’ve had a chance to declare your innocence—you become a
cipher. There is no more you.”</p>
<p>Silence all around him…The look in their eyes!…Begging for war
stories!</p>
<p>So he told them about the little Puerto Rican who knew all the
numbers. He told them about the game of hockey with the live mouse and
of how he (the hero) rescued the mouse and threw it out of the cell,
whereupon a cop crushed it with his heel. Confidently he turned to
Nunnally Voyd and said, “I think that falls under the heading of a
metaphor, Mr. Voyd.” He smiled wisely. “A metaphor for the whole
thing.”</p>
<p>Then he looked to his right. The lovely Lemon Tart was drinking in
his every word. He felt the tingle in his loins again.</p>
<p>After dinner quite a cluster it was that gathered around Sherman
McCoy in the di Duccis’ library. He entertained them with the story of
the cop who kept making him go through the metal detector.</p>
<p>Silvio di Ducci spoke up: “They can force you to do that?”</p>
<p>Sherman realized the story made him sound a bit too compliant and was
undercutting his new status as one who had braved the fires of hell.</p>
<p>“I made a deal,” he said. “I said, ‘Okay, I’ll let you show your
buddy how I set off the alarm, but you’ve got to do something for me.
You’ve got to get me out of that fucking’”—he said fucking very softly,
to indicate that, yes, he knew it was in poor taste but that under the
circumstances the verbatim quote was called for—“ ‘hog pen.’ ” He
pointed his finger in a knowing way, as if he were pointing toward the
holding pen in Central Booking in the Bronx. “And it paid off. They
brought me out early. Otherwise I would have had to spend the night on
Rikers Island, and that, I gather, is not…too…terrific.”</p>
<p>Every Tart in the cluster was his for the asking.</p>
<p>As the bodyguard, Occhioni, drove them to his parents’ house, to drop
Judy off, it was Sherman who was enjoying a social high. At the same
time, he was confused. Just who were these people?</p>
<p>“It’s ironic,” he said to Judy. “I’ve never liked these friends of
yours. I guess you’ve deduced that.”</p>
<p>“It didn’t require much in the way of deduction,” said Judy. She
wasn’t smiling.</p>
<p>“And yet they’re the only people who’ve been decent to me since this
whole thing started. My so-called old friends obviously wish I’d do the
right thing and disappear. These people, these people I don’t even know,
they treated me like a living human being.”</p>
<p>In the same guarded voice Judy said, “You’re famous. In the
newspapers, you’re a rich aristocrat. You’re a tycoon.”</p>
<p>“Only in the newspapers?”</p>
<p>“Oh, are you feeling rich all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m a rich aristocrat with a fabulous apartment by a famous
designer.” He wanted to get on her good side.</p>
<p>“Hah.” Quietly, bitterly.</p>
<p>“It’s perverse, isn’t it? Two weeks ago, when we were at the
Bavardages’, these same people froze me out. Now I’m
smeared—smeared!—across every newspaper and they can’t get enough of
me.”</p>
<p>She looked away from him, out the window. “You’re easily pleased.”
Her voice was as far off as her gaze.</p>
<p>McCoy andandandand McCoy shut down for the night.</p>
<p>“Whadda we got this morning, Sheldon?”</p>
<p>As soon as the words left his mouth, the Mayor regretted them. He
knew what his tiny assistant would say. It was inevitable, and so he
braced himself for the vile phrase, and sure enough, here it came.</p>
<p>“Mainly plaques for blacks,” said Sheldon. “Bishop Bottomley is here,
waiting to see you, and there’s been a dozen or so requests for you to
comment on the McCoy case.”</p>
<p>The Mayor wanted to remonstrate, as he had several times before, but
instead he turned away and looked out the window, toward Broadway. The
Mayor’s office was at ground level, a small but elegant room on the
corner with a high ceiling and grand Palladian windows. The view across
the little park around City Hall was sullied by the presence, in the
immediate foreground, right outside the window, of rows of blue police
barricades. They were stored there, permanently, on the grass—or rather
on bare patches where grass had once been—for use whenever
demonstrations erupted. They erupted all the time. When they did, the
police created a big blue fence with the barricades, and he could look
out at the broad beams of the cops as they faced whatever raggedy horde
of demonstrators was yammering away on the other side. What an amazing
array of stuff the cops carried on their backsides! Billies, blackjacks,
flashlights, handcuffs, bullets, citation books, walkie-talkies. He
continually found himself gazing upon the hulking cluttered backsides of
cops, while various malcontents shouted and growled, all for television,
of course.</p>
<p>Plaques for blacks plaques for blacks plaques for blacks plaques for
blacks. Now the vile phrase was running through his mind. Plaques for
blacks was a small way of fighting fire with fire. Every morning he went
from his office across to the Blue Room, and amid the portraits of
bald-headed politicians of years gone by, he handed out plaques and
citations to civic groups and teachers and prize-winning students and
brave citizens and noble volunteer workers and various other tillers and
toilers of the urban terrain. In these troubled times, with the surveys
going the way they were going, it was wise, and probably good, to single
out as many black recipients of these trophies and rhetorical flourishes
as possible, but it was not wise and it was not good for Sheldon
Lennert, this homunculus with his absurdly tiny head and his mismatched
checked shirts, jackets, and pants, to call the process “plaques for
blacks.” Already the Mayor had heard a couple of people in the press
office use the expression. What if some of the black members of the
staff overheard it? They might even laugh. But they wouldn’t be laughing
inside.</p>
<p>But no…Sheldon continued to say “plaques for blacks.” He knew the
Mayor hated it. Sheldon had the malicious streak of a court jester.
Outwardly he was as loyal as a dog. Inwardly he seemed to be mocking him
half the time. The Mayor’s anger rose.</p>
<p>“Sheldon, I told you I don’t want to hear that expression in this
office again!”</p>
<p>“Awright, awright,” said Sheldon. “Now whaddaya gonna say when they
ask you about the McCoy case?”</p>
<p>Sheldon always knew exactly how to distract him. He would bring up
whatever he knew confused the Mayor most profoundly, whatever made him
most dependent on Sheldon’s small but amazingly facile mind.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said the Mayor. “At first it looked pretty clear-cut.
We got this Wall Street guy who runs over a black honor student and
takes off. But now it turns out there was a second black kid, and he’s a
crack dealer, and maybe it was a robbery attempt. I guess I take the
judicial approach. I call for a full investigation and a careful
weighing of the evidence. Right?”</p>
<p>“Negative,” said Sheldon.</p>
<p>“Negative?” It was bewildering, the number of times Sheldon
challenged the obvious—and turned out to be absolutely right.</p>
<p>“Negative,” said Sheldon. “The McCoy case has become one of those
touchstone issues in the black community. It’s like divestiture and
South Africa. There are no two sides to the question. You suggest there
might be two sides, and you’re not even-handed, you’re biased. Same
thing here. The only question is, is a black life worth as much as a
white life? And the only answer is, white guys like this McCoy, from
Wall Street, driving their Mercedes-Benzes, can’t go around running over
black honor students and taking off because it’s inconvenient to
stop.”</p>
<p>“But that’s bullshit, Sheldon,” said the Mayor. “We don’t even know
for sure what happened yet.”</p>
<p>Sheldon shrugged. “So what else is new? That’s the only version Abe
Weiss is even willing to talk about. He’s running with this case like
he’s Abe Fucking Lincoln.”</p>
<p>“Weiss started all this?” The thought troubled the Mayor, because he
knew Weiss had always entertained the notion of making a bid for mayor
himself.</p>
<p>“No, Bacon started it,” said Sheldon. “Somehow he got to this drunk
on The City Light, this Brit, Fallow. That’s how it started. But now
it’s caught on. It’s gone way beyond Bacon and his gang. Like I say,
it’s a touchstone issue. Weiss’s got an election coming up. So do
you.”</p>
<p>The Mayor thought for a moment. “What kind of name is McCoy?
Irish?”</p>
<p>“No, he’s a Wasp.”</p>
<p>“What kind of person is he?”</p>
<p>“Rich Wasp. All the way. All the right schools, Park Avenue, Wall
Street, Pierce andandandand Pierce. His old man used to be the head of
Dunning Sponget andandandand Leach.”</p>
<p>“Did he support me? Or do you know?”</p>
<p>“Not that I know of. You know these characters. They don’t even think
about local elections, because in an election in New York City voting
Republican don’t mean shit. They vote for President. They vote for
senator. They talk about the Federal Reserve and supply side and all
that shit.”</p>
<p>“Unnnh-hunnnh. Well, what do I say?”</p>
<p>“You call for a complete and thorough investigation of McCoy’s role
in this tragedy and the appointment, if necessary, of a special
prosecutor. By the governor. ‘If necessary,’ you say, ‘if all the facts
are not forthcoming.’ That way you give a little jab to Abe, without
mentioning his name. You say the law must be no respecter of persons.
You say McCoy’s wealth and position cannot be allowed to keep this case
from being treated the same way it would be if Henry Lamb had run over
Sherman McCoy. Then you pledge the kid’s mother—Annie, I think, is her
name—you pledge the kid’s mother your full support and backing in
bringing to justice the perpetrator of the foul deed. There’s no way you
can lay it on too thick.”</p>
<p>“Kind of rough on this guy McCoy, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“That’s not your fault,” said Sheldon. “The guy hit the wrong kind of
kid in the wrong part of town driving the wrong brand of car with the
wrong woman, not his wife, in the bucket seat next to him. He doesn’t
come away looking so wonderful.”</p>
<p>The whole thing made the Mayor feel uneasy, but Sheldon’s instincts
were always correct in these can-of-worms situations. He thought some
more. “Okay,” he said, “I’ll grant you all that. But aren’t we making
Bacon look awfully good? I hate that son of a bitch.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but he’s already hit a home run with this thing. You can’t
change that. All you can do is go with the flow. It isn’t long until
November, and if you make a wrong move on the McCoy case, Bacon can
really give you some grief.”</p>
<p>The Mayor shook his head. “I guess you’re right. We put the Wasp to
the wall.” He shook his head again, and a cloud came over his face. “The
stupid bastard…What the hell was he doing tooling around on Bruckner
Boulevard at night in a Mercedes-Benz? Some people are just determined
to bring the roof down on themselves, aren’t they? He was asking for it.
I still don’t like it—but you’re right. Whatever he gets, he was asking
for it. Okay. So much for McCoy. Now, what’s Bishop What’s-his-name
want?”</p>
<p>“Bottomley. It’s about that Episcopal church, St. Timothy’s. The
bishop is black, incidentally.”</p>
<p>“The Episcopalians have a black bishop?”</p>
<p>“Oh, they’re very liberal,” said Sheldon, rolling his eyes. “It
coulda just as easy been a woman or a Sandinista. Or a lesbian. Or a
lesbian Sandinista.”</p>
<p>The Mayor shook his head some more. He found the Christian churches
baffling. When he was growing up, the goyim were all Catholics, unless
you counted the shvartzer, which nobody did. They didn’t even rate being
called goyim. The Catholics were two types, the Irish and the Italians.
The Irish were stupid and liked to fight and inflict pain. The Italians
were stupid and slob-like. Both were unpleasant, but the lineup was easy
enough to comprehend. He was in college before he realized there was
this whole other set of goyim, the Protestants. He never saw any. There
were only Jews, Irishmen, and Italians in college, but he heard about
them, and he learned that some of the most famous people in New York
were this type of goyim, the Protestants, people like the Rockefellers,
the Vanderbilts, the Roosevelts, the Astors, the Morgans. The term Wasp
was invented much later. The Protestants were split up into such a crazy
bunch of sects nobody could even keep track of them all. It was all very
pagan and spooky, when it wasn’t ridiculous. They were all worshiping
some obscure Jew from halfway around the world. The Rockefellers were!
The Roosevelts even! Very spooky it was, and yet these Protestants ran
the biggest law firms, the banks, the investment houses, the big
corporations. He never saw such people in the flesh, except at
ceremonies. Otherwise they didn’t exist in New York. They barely even
showed up in the voting surveys. In sheer numbers they were a
nullity—and yet there they were. And now one of these sects, the
Episcopalians, had a black bishop. You could joke about the Wasps, and
he often did so with his friends, and yet they weren’t so much funny as
creepy.</p>
<p>“And this church,” said the Mayor, “something about Landmarks?”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Sheldon. “The bishop wants to sell St. Timothy’s to a
developer, on the grounds that the membership is declining and the
church is losing a lot of money, which is true. But the community groups
are putting a lot of pressure on the Landmarks Commission to landmark it
so that nobody can alter the building even if they buy it.”</p>
<p>“Is this guy honest?” asked the Mayor. “Who gets the money if they
sell the church?”</p>
<p>“I never heard he wasn’t honest,” said Sheldon. “He’s a learned
gentleman of the cloth. He went to Harvard. He could still be greedy, I
suppose, but I have no reason to think he is.”</p>
<p>“Unnh-hunh.” The Mayor suddenly had an idea. “Well, send him in.”</p>
<p>Bishop Warren Bottomley turned out to be one of those well-educated,
urbane black people who immediately create the Halo Effect in the eyes
of white people who hadn’t known what to expect. For a moment or two the
Mayor was even intimidated, so dynamic was Bishop Bottomley. He was
handsome, slender, about forty-five, athletic in build. He had a ready
smile, a glittering eye, a firm handshake, and he wore a clerical outfit
that was similar to a Catholic priest’s but had an expensive look. And
he was tall, much taller than the Mayor, who was touchy about his small
size. Once they sat down, the Mayor got his perspective back and thought
about his idea. Yes, Bishop Warren Bottomley would be perfection
itself.</p>
<p>After a few well-delivered pleasantries about the Mayor’s illustrious
political career, the bishop began laying out the financial plight of
St. Timothy’s.</p>
<p>“Of course, I can understand the concerns of the people of the
community,” said the bishop. “They don’t want to see a larger building
or a different sort of building.”</p>
<p>No black accent at all, thought the Mayor. He seemed to run into
black people with no accent all the time now. The fact that he noticed
it made him feel mildly guilty, but he noticed it all the same.</p>
<p>“But very few of these people are members of St. Timothy’s Church,”
the bishop continued, “which of course is precisely the problem. There
are fewer than seventy-five regular members in a very large building,
which incidentally has no architectural distinction. The architect was a
man named Samuel D. Wiggins, a contemporary of Cass Gilbert who has left
not a single footprint in the sands of architectural history, so far as
I can determine.”</p>
<p>This casual reference intimidated the Mayor still further. Art and
architecture were not his strong suits.</p>
<p>“Frankly, St. Timothy’s Church is no longer serving its community,
Mr. Mayor, because it is no longer in a position to do so, and we feel
it would be of far greater benefit, not only to the Episcopal Church and
its more vital manifestations in our city, but to the city itself—since
a large taxable entity could be erected on that site, and even the
community would benefit, indirectly, in the sense that the whole city
would gain through the increase in tax revenues. That’s why we would
like to sell the present structure, and we request your consideration…so
that the building will not be landmarked, as the Landmarks Commission
wants to do.”</p>
<p>Thank God! The Mayor was relieved to see that the bishop had gotten
tangled up in his grammar and had left an incomplete sentence in the
road behind him. Without saying a word, the Mayor smiled at the bishop
and put his finger beside his nose, like Santa Claus in “The Night
before Christmas.” Then he pointed his finger straight up in the air, as
if to say “Hark!” or “Watch this!” He beamed at the bishop and pushed a
button on the intercom box on the credenza by his desk and said, “Get me
the Landmarks Commissioner.” Presently, there was a low beep-beep sound,
and the Mayor picked up his telephone.</p>
<p>“Mort?…You know St. Timothy’s Church?…Right. Exactly…Mort—LAY
OFF!”</p>
<p>The Mayor hung up and leaned back in his chair and smiled once more
at the bishop.</p>
<p>“You mean—that’s it?” The bishop seemed genuinely startled and
delighted. “That’s…the commission…they won’t…”</p>
<p>The Mayor nodded and smiled.</p>
<p>“Mr. Mayor, I scarcely know how to thank you. Believe me—I’ve been
told you have a way of getting things done, but—well! I’m very grateful!
And I can assure you that I will see to it that everyone in the diocese
and all of our friends are aware of what a great service you have done
for us. Yes indeed, I will!”</p>
<p>“That’s not necessary, Bishop,” said the Mayor. “There’s no need to
regard it as a favor or even as a service. The facts you so ably
presented to me were very persuasive, and I think the entire city is
going to benefit. I’m happy to do something for yoooou that’s good for
yoooou and for the city of New York.”</p>
<p>“You certainly have! And I’m most appreciative.”</p>
<p>“Now, in the same spirit,” said the Mayor, adopting his best
school-teacherly tone, which had served him so well so often, “I want
yo-o-o-ou to do something for me-e-e-e…that is likewise good for
yo-o-o-ou and for the city of New York.”</p>
<p>The Mayor cocked his head and smiled more broadly than ever. He
looked like a robin eyeing a worm.</p>
<p>“Bishop, I want you to serve on a special blue-ribbon commission on
crime in New York that I will be forming shortly. I’d like to announce
your appointment the same time that I announce the formation of the
commission. I don’t have to tell you what a crucial issue this is, and
one of our biggest problems is all the racial overtones, all the
perceptions and misperceptions about who commits crimes and how our
police officers deal with crimes. There’s not a more important service
you could render the city of New York at this time than to serve on this
commission. How about it?”</p>
<p>The Mayor could see the dismay in the bishop’s face immediately.</p>
<p>“I feel highly flattered, Mr. Mayor,” said the bishop. He didn’t look
highly flattered, however. No more smiles. “And I agree with you, of
course. But I must explain to you that insofar as my activities as
bishop of this diocese interact with the public or, let me say, the
official sector, my hands are somewhat tied, and…”</p>
<p>But his hands were not tied at this moment. He began twisting them as
if trying to open a jar of pickled peaches, as he attempted to explain
to the Mayor the structure of the Episcopal Church and the theology
underlying the structure and the teleology of the theology and what
could or could not be rendered unto Caesar.</p>
<p>The Mayor tuned out after ten or twelve seconds but let the bishop
ramble on, taking a bitter pleasure in the man’s distress. Oh, it was
quite clear. The bastard was filling the air with bullshit to cover up
the fact that no Rising Black Leader such as himself could afford to
affiliate with the Mayor in any way, not even to the extent of serving
on a fucking commission on fucking crime. And it had been such a
brilliant idea! A biracial commission on crime, with a half dozen
good-looking dynamic black leaders such as the bishop. Bishop Warren
Bottomley would resonate with the heartbeats of every decent black
person in New York, the very constituency the Mayor had to have if he
was to win in November. And this smooth Harvard-educated snake was
already wiggling out of his grasp! Long before the bishop had completed
his exegeses and apologies, the Mayor had abandoned the idea of a
special blue-ribbon commission on crime in New York City.</p>
<p>“I’m truly sorry,” said the bishop, “but church policy leaves me no
choice.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I understand,” said the Mayor. “What you can’t do, you can’t do.
I can’t think of anyone I’d rather see serve on the commission, but I
understand your situation completely.”</p>
<p>“I’m doubly sorry, Mr. Mayor, in view of what you’ve just done for
our church.” The bishop was wondering if the deal was still on.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry about that,” said the Mayor. “Don’t worry about that
at all. As I said, I didn’t do it for you, and I didn’t do it for your
church. I did it because I think it’s in the best interests of the city.
It’s as simple as that.”</p>
<p>“Well, I am grateful, nonetheless,” said the bishop, getting up, “and
you can be sure that the entire diocese will be grateful. I’ll see to
that.”</p>
<p>“That’s not necessary,” said the Mayor. “Every now and then it’s nice
to come across a proposition that has an irresistible logic all its
own.”</p>
<p>The Mayor gave the bishop his broadest smile and looked him squarely
in the face and shook his hand and kept smiling until the bishop left
the room. When the Mayor returned to his desk, he pressed a button and
said, “Get me the Landmarks Commissioner.”</p>
<p>Presently there was a low beep-beep, and the Mayor picked up his
telephone and said, “Mort? You know that church,
St. Timothy’s?…Right…LANDMARK THE SON OF A BITCH!”</p>
