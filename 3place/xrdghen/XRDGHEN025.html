<h4 id="we-the-jury">25. We the Jury</h4>
<p>This is nothing but the Establishment looking after its own,” said
Reverend Bacon. He was leaning back in his chair at his desk and talking
into the telephone, but his tones were official. For he was talking to
the press. “This is the Power Structure manufacturing and disseminating
its lies with the willing connivance of its lackeys in the media, and
its lies are transparent.”</p>
<p>Edward Fiske III, although a young man, recognized the rhetoric of
the Movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Reverend Bacon stared at
the mouthpiece of the telephone with a look of righteous anger. Fiske
slumped down a little farther in his chair. His eyes jumped from
Reverend Bacon’s face to the swamp-yellow sycamores in the yard beyond
the window and then back to Reverend Bacon and then back to the
sycamores. He didn’t know whether eye contact with the man was wise at
this point or not, even though the thing that had provoked the anger had
nothing to do with Fiske’s visit. Bacon was furious over the piece in
this morning’s Daily News suggesting that Sherman McCoy might have been
escaping from a robbery attempt when his car hit Henry Lamb. The Daily
News intimated that Lamb’s accomplice was a convicted felon named Roland
Auburn and that the district attorney’s entire case against Sherman
McCoy was based on a story concocted by this individual, who was now
seeking a plea bargain in a drug case.</p>
<p>“You doubt that they stoop so low?” Reverend Bacon declaimed into the
mouthpiece. “You doubt they can be vile? Now you see them stoop so low,
they try to smear young Henry Lamb. Now you see them vilify the victim,
who lies mortally wounded and cannot speak for himself. For them to say
that Henry Lamb is a robber—that’s the criminal act…see…That’s the
criminal act. But that is the twisted mind of the Power Structure, that
is the underlying racist mentality. Since Henry Lamb is a young black
male, they think they can brand him as a criminal…see…They think they
can smear him in that way. But they are wrong. Henry Lamb’s life refutes
their lies. Henry Lamb is everything the Power Structure tells the young
black male he is supposed to be, but when the needs of one a their own
demand it…see…one a their own…then they think nothing of turning around
and trying to destroy the good name of this young man…What?…Say, ‘Who
are they?’…You think Sherman McCoy stands alone? You think he is by
himself? He is one a the most powerful men at Pierce andandandand
Pierce, and Pierce andandandand Pierce is one a the most powerful forces
in Wall Street. I know Pierce andandandand Pierce…see…I know what they
can do. You heard a capitalists. You heard a plutocrats. You take a look
at Sherman McCoy and you’re looking at a capitalist, you’re looking at a
plutocrat.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon eviscerated the offending newspaper article. The Daily
News was a notorious toady of the corporate interests. The reporter who
wrote the pack of lies, Neil Flannagan, was a lackey so shameless as to
lend his name to such a disgusting campaign. His font of so-called
information—referred to coyly as “sources close to the case”—was
obviously McCoy and his cabal.</p>
<p>The McCoy case was of no interest to Fiske, except as ordinary
gossip, although he did know the Englishman who had first exposed the
whole situation, a wonderful witty fellow named Peter Fallow, who was a
master of the art of conversation. No, Fiske’s only interest was in how
much Bacon’s involvement in it was going to complicate his task, which
was to retrieve the 50,000 or some part of it. In the half hour he had
been sitting here, Bacon’s secretary had buzzed in with calls from two
newspapers, the Associated Press, a Bronx assemblyman, a Bronx
congressman, and the executive secretary of the Gay Fist Strike Force,
all concerning the McCoy case. And Reverend Bacon was now talking to a
man named Irv Stone, from Channel 1. At first Fiske figured his mission
was (yet once again) hopeless. But behind Reverend Bacon’s baleful
orotundity he began to detect a buoyancy, a joie de combat. Reverend
Bacon loved what was going on. He was leading the crusade. He was in his
element. Somewhere in all of this, at last, if he picked the right
moment, Edward Fiske III might find an opening through which to retrieve
the Episcopal Church’s 50,000 from the Heavenly Crusader’s promiscuous
heap of schemes.</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon was saying, “There’s the cause and there’s the effect,
Irv…see…And we had a demonstration at the Poe projects, where Henry Lamb
lives. That’s the effect…see…What happened to Henry Lamb is the effect.
Well, today we gonna take it to the cause. We gonna take it to Park
Avenue. To Park Avenue, see, from whence the lies commence…from whence
they commence…What?…Right. Henry Lamb cannot speak for himself, but he’s
gonna have a mighty voice. He’s gonna have the voice of his people, and
that voice is gonna be heard on Park Avenue.”</p>
<p>Fiske had never seen Reverend Bacon’s face so animated. He began
asking Irv Stone technical questions. Naturally, he couldn’t guarantee
Channel 1 an exclusive this time, but could he count on live coverage?
What was the optimal time? Same as before? And so forth and so on.
Finally he hung up. He turned toward Fiske and looked at him with
portentous concentration and said:</p>
<p>“The steam.”</p>
<p>“The steam?”</p>
<p>“The steam…You remember I told you about the steam?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. I do.”</p>
<p>“Well, now you gonna see the steam coming to a head. The whole city’s
gonna see it. Right on Park Avenue. People think the fire has gone out.
They think the rage is a thing of the past. They don’t know it’s only
been bottled up. It’s when the steam is trapped, you find out what it
can do…see…That’s when you find out it’s Powder Valley for you and your
whole gang. Pierce andandandand Pierce only know how to handle one kind
of capital. They don’t understand the steam. They can’t handle the
steam.”</p>
<p>Fiske spotted a tiny opening.</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, Reverend Bacon, I was talking to a man from
Pierce andandandand Pierce about you just the other day. Linwood Talley,
from the underwriting division.”</p>
<p>“They know me there,” said Reverend Bacon. He smiled, but a trifle
sardonically. “They know me. They don’t know the steam.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Talley was telling me about Urban Guaranty Investments. He said
it’s been highly successful.”</p>
<p>“I can’t complain.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Talley didn’t go into any details, but I gather it’s been”—he
searched for the proper euphemism—“profitable right from the
beginning.”</p>
<p>“Ummmmmm.” Reverend Bacon didn’t seem inclined to expand.</p>
<p>Fiske said nothing and tried to hold Reverend Bacon’s gaze with his
own, in hopes of creating a conversational vacuum the great crusader
couldn’t resist. The truth about Urban Guaranty Investments, as Fiske
had in fact learned from Linwood Talley, was that the federal government
had recently given the firm 50,000 as a “minority underwriter” for a
billion issue of federally backed municipal bonds. The so-called
set-aside law required that there be minority participation in the
selling of such bonds, and Urban Guaranty Investments had been created
to help satisfy that requirement of the law. There was no requirement
that the minority firm actually sell any of the bonds or even receive
them. The lawmakers did not want to wrap the task in red tape. It was
only necessary for the firm to participate in the issue. Participate was
broadly defined. In most cases—Urban Guaranty Investments was but one of
many such firms across the country—participation meant receiving a check
for the fee from the federal government and depositing it, and not much
more. Urban Guaranty Investments had no employees, and no equipment,
just an address (Fiske was at it), a telephone number, and a president,
Reginald Bacon.</p>
<p>“So it just occurred to me, Reverend Bacon, in terms of our
conversations and what the diocese is naturally concerned about and what
remains to be worked out, if we are to resolve what I’m sure you want to
resolve just as much as the bishop, who, I have to tell you, has been
pressing me on this point—” Fiske paused. As often happened in his talks
with Reverend Bacon, he couldn’t remember how he had begun his sentence.
He had no idea what the number and tense of the predicate should be.
“—pressing me on this point, and, uh, uh, the thing is, we thought
perhaps you might be in a position to shift some funds into the escrow
account we mentioned, the escrow account for the Little Shepherd Day
Care Center, just until our licensing problems are worked out.”</p>
<p>“I don’t follow you,” said Reverend Bacon.</p>
<p>Fiske had the sinking feeling he was going to have to think of some
way to say it again.</p>
<p>But Reverend Bacon bailed him out. “Are you saying we ought to shift
money from Urban Guaranty Investments to the Little Shepherd Day Care
Center?”</p>
<p>“Not in so many words, Reverend Bacon, but if the funds are available
or could be loaned out…”</p>
<p>“But that’s illegal! You’re talking about commingling funds! We can’t
shift moneys from one corporation to another just because it looks like
one of them needs it more.”</p>
<p>Fiske looked at the rock of fiscal probity, half expecting a wink,
even though he knew Reverend Bacon wasn’t a winker. “Well, the diocese
has always been willing to go the extra mile with you, Reverend Bacon,
in the sense that if there was room to find some flexibility in the
strict reading of the regulation, such as the time you and the board of
directors of the Inner City Family Restructuring Society made the trip
to Paris and the diocese paid for it out of the Missionary Society
budget—” Once again he was drowning in the syntactical soup, but it
didn’t matter.</p>
<p>“No way,” said Reverend Bacon.</p>
<p>“Well, if not that, then—”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon’s secretary’s voice came over the intercom: “Mr. Vogel
is on the line.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon wheeled about to the telephone on the credenza:
“Al?…Yeah, I saw it. They’ll drag that young man’s name through the mud
and think nothing of it.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon and his caller, Vogel, went on for some time about the
piece in the Daily News. This Mr. Vogel evidently reminded Reverend
Bacon that the district attorney, Weiss, had told the Daily News there
was absolutely no evidence to support the theory of a robbery
attempt.</p>
<p>“Can’t depend on him,” said Reverend Bacon. “He’s like the bat. You
know the fable of the bat? The birds and the beasts were having a war.
As long as the birds were winning, the bat says he’s a bird, because he
can fly. When the beasts were winning, the bat says he’s a beast,
because he got teeth. That’s why the bat don’t come out in the daytime.
Don’t nobody want to look at his two faces.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon listened for a bit, then said, “Yes, I do, Al. There’s
a gentleman from the Episcopal diocese of New York with me right now.
You want me to call you back?…Unh-hunh…Unh-hunh…You say his apartment’s
worth three million dollars?” He shook his head. “I never hearda such a
thing. I say it’s time Park Avenue heard the voice of the
streets…Unh-hunh…I’ll call you back about that. I’ll talk to Annie Lamb
before I call you. When you thinking about filing?…About the same, when
I talked to her yesterday. He’s on the life-support system. He don’t say
anything and don’t know anybody. When you think about that young man,
there’s no amount can pay for it, is there?…Well, I’ll get back to you
as soon as I can.”</p>
<p>After he hung up, Reverend Bacon shook his head sadly, but then
looked up with a gleam in his eye and just a trace of a smile. With an
athletic quickness he rose from his chair and came around the desk with
his hand out, as if Fiske had just announced he had to leave.</p>
<p>“Always good to see you!”</p>
<p>Reflexively, Fiske shook his hand, at the same time saying, “But,
Reverend Bacon, we haven’t—”</p>
<p>“We’ll talk again. I got an awful lot to do—a demonstration right on
Park Avenue, got to help Mr. Lamb file a hundred-million-dollar lawsuit
against Sherman McCoy…”</p>
<p>“But, Reverend Bacon, I can’t leave without an answer. The diocese
has really reached the end—that is, they insist that I—”</p>
<p>“You tell the diocese they’re doing fine. I told you last time, this
is the best investment you people ever made. You tell ’em they’re taking
an option. They’re buying the future at a discount. You tell ’em they’ll
see what I mean very shortly, no time at all.” He put his arm about
Fiske’s shoulder in a comradely fashion and hastened his exit, all the
while saying, “Don’t worry about a thing. You’re doing fine, see. Doing
fine. They’re gonna say, ‘That young man, he took a risk and hit the
jackpot.’”</p>
<p>Utterly befuddled, Fiske was swept outside by a tide of optimism and
the pressure of a strong arm across his back.</p>
<p>The noise of the bullhorn and the bellows of rage rose up ten stories
from Park Avenue in the heat of June—ten stories!—nothing to it!—they
can almost reach up!—until the bedlam below seemed to be part of the air
he breathed. The bullhorn bellowed his name! The hard C in McCoy cut
through the roar of the mob and soared up above the vast sprawl of
hatred below. He edged over to the library window and risked looking
down. Suppose they see me! The demonstrators had spilled out onto the
street on both sides of the median strip and had brought traffic to a
halt. The police were trying to drive them back onto the sidewalks.
Three policemen were chasing another bunch, fifteen or twenty at least,
through the yellow tulips on the median strip. As they ran, the
demonstrators held a long banner aloft: WAKE UP, PARK AVENUE! YOU CAN’T
HIDE FROM THE PEOPLE! The yellow tulips fell before them, and they left
a gutter of crushed blossoms behind them, and the three policemen came
pounding through the gutter. Sherman stared, horrified. The sight of the
perfect yellow spring tulips of Park Avenue falling before the feet of
the mob paralyzed him with fear. A television crew lumbered along out in
the street, trying to catch up with them. The one carrying the camera on
his shoulder stumbled, and down he went, crashing to the pavement,
camera and all. The mob’s banners and placards bobbed and swayed like
sails in a windy harbor. One enormous banner said, inexplicably, GAY
FIST AGAINST CLASS JUSTICE. The two s’s in CLASS were swastikas. Another
one—Christ! Sherman caught his breath. In gigantic letters it said:</p>
<p>Sherman McCoy:</p>
<p>We The Jury</p>
<p>Want You!</p>
<p>Then there was a crude approximation of a finger pointing straight at
you, as in the old UNCLE SAM WANTS YOU posters. They seemed to be
holding it at an angle, just so he could read it from up here. He fled
the library and sat in the rear part of the living room in an armchair,
one of Judy’s beloved Louis-Something bergères, or was it a fauteuil?
Killian was pacing up and down, still crowing about the article in the
Daily News, apparently to buck up his spirits, but Sherman was no longer
listening. He could hear the deep ugly voice of one of the bodyguards,
who was in the library answering the telephone. “Stick it up your face.”
Every time one of the threats came in over the telephone, the bodyguard,
a small swarthy man named Occhioni, said, “Stick it up your face.” The
way he said it, it sounded worse than any of the classic vulgarities.
How had they gotten his private number? Probably from the press—in the
open cavity. They were here on Park Avenue at the door below. They were
coming in over the telephone. How long before they burst in, into the
entry gallery, and came screaming across that solemn green marble floor!
The other bodyguard, McCarthy, was in the entry gallery, sitting in one
of Judy’s beloved Thomas Hope armchairs, and what good would he be?
Sherman sat back, his eyes cast downward, fixed upon the slender legs of
a Sheraton Pembroke table, a hellishly expensive thing Judy had found in
one of those antique shops on Fifty-seventh Street…hellishly
expensive…hellishly…Mr. Occhioni, who said “Stick it up your face” to
everyone who called threatening his life…00 per eight-hour shift…another
00 for the impassive Mr. McCarthy…double that for the two bodyguards at
his parents’ house on East Seventy-third, where Judy, Campbell, Bonita,
and Miss Lyons were…00 per eight-hour shift…all former New York City
policemen from some agency Killian knew about…,400 a day…hemorrhaging
money…McCOY!…McCOY!…a tremendous roar from the street below…And
presently he wasn’t thinking about the Pembroke table or the bodyguards
anymore…He was staring catatonically and wondering about the barrel. How
big was it? He had used it so many times, most recently on the Leash
Club hunt last fall, but he couldn’t remember how big it was! It was
big, being a double-barrel 12-gauge. Was it too big to get in his mouth?
No, it couldn’t be that big, but what would it feel like? What would it
feel like, touching the roof of his mouth? What would it taste like?
Would he have trouble breathing long enough to…to…How would he pull the
trigger? Let’s see, he’d hold the barrel steady in his mouth with one
hand, his left hand—but how long was the barrel? It was long…Could he
reach the trigger with his right hand? Maybe not! His toe…He’d read
somewhere about someone who took off his shoe and pressed the trigger
with his toe…Where would he do it? The gun was at the house on Long
Island…assuming he could get to Long Island, get out of this building,
escape from besieged Park Avenue, get away alive from…WE THE JURY…The
flower bed out beyond the tool house…Judy always called it the cutting
bed…He’d sit down out there…If it made a mess, it wouldn’t
matter…Suppose Campbell was the one who found him!…The thought didn’t
reduce him to tears the way he thought it might…hoped it might…She
wouldn’t be finding her father…He wasn’t her father anymore…wasn’t
anything anyone had ever known as Sherman McCoy…He was only a cavity
fast filling with hot vile hate…</p>
<p>The telephone rang in the library. Sherman braced. Stick it up your
face? But all he heard was the rumble of Occhioni’s normal voice.
Presently the little man stuck his head into the living room and said,
“Hey, Mr. McCoy, it’s somebody named Sally Rawthrote. You wanna talk to
her or not?”</p>
<p>Sally Rawthrote? She was the woman he had sat next to at the
Bavardages’, the woman who had lost interest in him immediately and then
froze him out for the rest of the dinner. Why would she want to talk to
him now? Why should he want to talk to her at all? He didn’t, but a tiny
spark of curiosity was lit within the cavity, and he stood up and looked
at Killian and shrugged and went into the library and sat at his desk
and picked up the telephone.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Sherman! Sally Rawthrote:” Sherman. Oldest friend in the world. “I
hope this isn’t a bad time?”</p>
<p>A bad time? From below a tremendous roar welled up, and the bullhorn
screamed and bellowed, and he heard his name. McCOY!…McCOY!</p>
<p>“Well, of course it’s a bad time,” said Sally Rawthrote. “What am I
saying? But I just thought I’d take a chance and call and see if there’s
any way I might help.”</p>
<p>Help? As she spoke, her face came back to him, that dreadful tense
nearsighted face that focused about four and a half inches from the
bridge of your nose.</p>
<p>“Well, thank you,” said Sherman.</p>
<p>“You know, I live just a few blocks down from you. Same side of the
street.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>
<p>“I’m on the northwest corner. If you’re going to live on Park, I
think there’s nothing quite like the northwest corner. You get so much
sun! Of course, where you are is nice, too. Your building’s got some of
the most beautiful apartments in New York. I haven’t been in yours since
the McLeods had it. They had it before the Kittredges. Anyway, from my
bedroom, which is on the corner, I can look right down Park to where you
are. I’m looking down there right now, and that mob—it’s absolutely
outrageous! I feel so badly for you and Judy—I just had to call and see
if there’s anything I can do. I hope I’m not being out of place?”</p>
<p>“No, you’re very kind. By the way, how did you get my number?”</p>
<p>“I called Inez Bavardage. Was that all right?”</p>
<p>“To tell you the truth, it doesn’t make a hell of a lot of difference
at this point, Mrs. Rawthrote.”</p>
<p>“Sally.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, thank you.”</p>
<p>“As I say, if I can be of any help, let me know. With the apartment,
is what I mean.”</p>
<p>“With the apartment?”</p>
<p>Another rumble…a roar…MCCOY! MCCOY!</p>
<p>“If you should decide you want to do anything with the apartment. I’m
with Benning Sturtevant, as you probably know, and I know that often in
situations like this people sometimes find it advantageous to become as
liquid as they can. Hah hah, I could stand a bit of that myself! Anyway,
it’s a consideration, and I assure you—assure you—I can get you three
and a half for your apartment. Just like that. I can guarantee it.”</p>
<p>The woman’s gall was astounding. It was beyond good and bad form,
beyond…taste…It was astounding. It made Sherman smile, and he didn’t
think he could smile.</p>
<p>“Well, well, well, well, Sally. I do admire foresightedness. You
looked out your northwest window and you saw an apartment for sale.”</p>
<p>“Not at all! I just thought—”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re just one step too late, Sally. You’ll have to talk to a
man named Albert Vogel.”</p>
<p>“Who’s that?”</p>
<p>“He’s the lawyer for Henry Lamb. He’s filed a hundred-million-dollar
lawsuit against me, and I’m not sure if I’m free to sell a rug at this
point. Well, maybe I could sell a rug. You want to sell a rug for
me?”</p>
<p>“Hah hah, no. Rugs I don’t know anything about. I don’t see how they
can freeze your assets. That seems totally unfair. I mean, you were the
victim, after all, weren’t you? I read the story in the Daily News
today. Ordinarily I only read Bess Hill and Bill Hatcher, but I was
turning the pages—and there was your picture. I said, ‘My God, it’s
Sherman!’ So I read the story—and you were only avoiding a robbery
attempt. It’s so unfair!” She chattered on. She was fireproof. She
couldn’t be mocked.</p>
<p>After hanging up, Sherman returned to the living room.</p>
<p>Killian said, “Who was that?”</p>
<p>Sherman said, “A real-estate broker I met at dinner. She wanted to
sell my apartment for me.”</p>
<p>“She say how much she could get you?”</p>
<p>“Three and a half million dollars.”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s see,” said Killian. “If she gets her 6 percent
commission, that’s…ummmm…10,000. That’s worth sounding stone-cold
opportunistic over, I guess. But I’ll say one thing for her.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“She made you smile. So she ain’t all bad.”</p>
<p>Another roar, the loudest yet…MCCOY!…MCCOY!…The two of them stood in
the middle of the living room and listened for a moment.</p>
<p>“Jesus, Tommy,” said Sherman. It was the first time he had called him
by his first name, but he didn’t stop to think about that. “I can’t
believe I’m standing here and all this is happening. I’m holed up in my
apartment and Park Avenue is occupied by a mob waiting to kill me. Kill
me!”</p>
<p>“Awwwwww, f’r Chrissake, that’s the last thing they wanna do. You
ain’t worth a goddamned thing to Bacon dead, and he thinks you’re gonna
be worth a lot to him alive.”</p>
<p>“To Bacon? What does he get out of it?”</p>
<p>“Millions is what he thinks he’s gonna get out of it. I can’t prove
it, but I say this whole thing is over the civil suits.”</p>
<p>“But Henry Lamb is the one who’s suing. Or his mother, I guess it is,
in his behalf. How does Bacon get anything out of it?”</p>
<p>“All right.” Awright. “Who is the lawyer representing Henry Lamb?
Albert Vogel. And how does Henry Lamb’s mother get to Albert Vogel?
Because she admired his brilliant defense of the Utica Four and the
Waxahachie Eight in 1969? Fuhgedaboudit. Bacon steers her to Vogel,
because the two a them are tight. Whatever the Lambs get in a lawsuit,
Vogel gets at least a third a that, and you can be sure he splits that
with Bacon, or he’s gonna have a mob coming after him that means
business. One thing in this world I know from A to Z, and that’s lawyers
and where their money comes from and where it goes.”</p>
<p>“But Bacon had his campaign going about Henry Lamb before he even
knew I was involved.”</p>
<p>“Oh, at the beginning they were just going after the hospital, on the
grounds of malpractice. They were gonna sue the city. If Bacon could get
it built up into a big deal in the press, then a jury might give ’em
what they wanted. A jury in a civil case…with a racial angle? They had a
good shot.”</p>
<p>“So the same goes for me,” said Sherman.</p>
<p>“I won’t try to kid you. That’s very true. But if you beat the felony
case, then there’s no civil case.”</p>
<p>“And if I don’t win the felony case, I won’t care about the civil
case,” said Sherman, looking very glum.</p>
<p>“Well, you gotta admit one thing,” said Killian in a cheer-up voice,
“this thing has made you a giant on Wall Street. One freakin’ giant,
bro. Juh see what Flannagan called you in the Daily News? ‘Pierce
andandandand Pierce’s fabled chief bond salesman.’ Fabled. A legend in
your own time. You’re the son of ‘the aristocratic John Campbell McCoy,’
former head of Dunning Sponget andandandand Leach. You’re the fabled
investment banking genius aristocrat. Bacon probably thinks you got half
the money in the world.”</p>
<p>“If you want to know the truth,” said Sherman, “I don’t even know
where I’m gonna get the money to pay…” He motioned toward the library,
where Occhioni was. “This civil suit mentions everything. They’re even
after the quarterly share of profits I was supposed to get at the end of
this month. I can’t imagine how they knew about it. They even referred
to it by the in-company name, which is the ‘Pie B.’ They’d have to know
someone at Pierce andandandand Pierce.”</p>
<p>“Pierce andandandand Pierce’ll look after you, won’t they?”</p>
<p>“Hah. I don’t exist at Pierce andandandand Pierce anymore. There’s no
such thing as loyalty on Wall Street. Maybe there once was—my father
always talked as if there was—but there isn’t now. I’ve gotten one
telephone call from Pierce andandandand Pierce, and that wasn’t from
Lopwitz. It was from Arnold Parch. He wanted to know if there was
anything they could do, and then he couldn’t get off the telephone fast
enough, for fear I’d think of something. Although I don’t know why I
single out Pierce andandandand Pierce. Our own friends have all been the
same way. My wife can’t even make play dates for our daughter. She’s six
years old…”</p>
<p>He stopped. He suddenly felt uncomfortable parading his personal woes
before Killian. Goddamned Garland Reed and his wife! They wouldn’t even
let Campbell come play with MacKenzie! Some utterly lame excuse…Garland
hadn’t even called once, and he’d known him all his life. At least
Rawlie had had the guts to call. He’d called three times. He’d probably
even have the guts to come see him…if WE THE JURY ever vacated Park
Avenue…Maybe he would…</p>
<p>“It’s damned sobering, how fast it goes when it goes,” he said to
Killian. He didn’t want to say this much, but he couldn’t help himself.
“All these ties you have, all these people you went to school with and
to college, the people who are in your clubs, the people you go out to
dinner with—it’s all a thread, Tommy, all these ties that make up your
life, and when it breaks…that’s it!…That’s it…I feel so sorry for my
daughter, my little girl. She’ll mourn me, she’ll mourn her daddy, the
daddy she remembers, without knowing he’s already dead.”</p>
<p>“What the hell you talking about?” said Killian.</p>
<p>“You’ve never been through anything like this. I don’t doubt you’ve
seen a lot of it, but you’ve never been through it. I can’t explain the
feeling. All I can tell you is that I’m already dead, or the Sherman
McCoy of the McCoy family and Yale and Park Avenue and Wall Street is
dead. Your self—I don’t know how to explain it, but if, God forbid,
anything like this ever happens to you, you’ll know what I mean. Your
self…is other people, all the people you’re tied to, and it’s only a
thread.”</p>
<p>“Ayyyyy, Sherman,” said Killian. “Gimme a break. It don’t do any good
to philosophize in the middle of a war.”</p>
<p>“Some war.”</p>
<p>“F’r Chrissake, whaddaya whaddaya? This story in the Daily News is
very important for you. Weiss must be going crazy. We’ve blown the cover
on this lowlife smokehead he’s got for a witness. Auburn. Now we’ve got
another theory out there for the whole business. Now there’s a basis for
people to support you. We’ve gotten across the idea that you were the
intended victim of a setup, a robbery. That changes the whole picture
for you, and we haven’t compromised you in the slightest.”</p>
<p>“It’s too late.”</p>
<p>“Whaddaya mean, too late? Give it a little time, f’r Chrissake. This
guy Flannagan at the News will play as long as we wanna play. The Brit,
Fallow, at The City Light, been beating his brains out with this story.
So he’ll take whatever I give him. This fucking story he just wrote
couldn’ta come out any better if I dictated it to him. He not only
identifies Auburn, he uses the mug shot Quigley got!” Killian was hugely
delighted. “And he got in the fact that two weeks ago Weiss was calling
Auburn the Crack King of Evergreen Avenue.”</p>
<p>“What difference does that make?”</p>
<p>“It don’t look good. If you got a guy in jail on a major felony and
he suddenly comes forward to give evidence in return for dropping the
charge or knocking it down, it don’t look good. It don’t look good to a
jury, and it don’t look good to the press. If he’s in on a misdemeanor
or an E felony or something, it don’t make so much difference, because
the presumption is, it don’t matter that much to him, the time he’s
facing.”</p>
<p>Sherman said, “One thing I’ve always wondered about, Tommy. Why did
Auburn, when he made up his story—why did he have me driving the car?
Why not Maria, who was actually driving the car when Lamb got hit? What
difference did it make to Auburn?”</p>
<p>“He had to do it that way. He didn’t know what witnesses might have
seen your car just before Lamb got hit and just after he got hit, and he
has to have some explanation for why you were driving up to the point
where the thing happened and she was the one who drove away from there.
If he says you stopped, and then you and her changed places and she
drove off and hit Lamb, then the logical question is ‘Why did they
stop?’ and the logical answer is ‘Because some lowlife like Roland
Auburn put up a barricade and tried to take them off.’”</p>
<p>“What’s his name?—Flannagan—doesn’t get into any of that.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You’ll notice I didn’t give him anything about a woman
being in the car one way or the other. When the time comes, we want
Maria on our side. You’ll also notice that Flannagan wrote the whole
fucking story without even making any big deal about the ‘mystery
woman.’”</p>
<p>“Very obliging fellow. Why is that?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I know the guy. He’s another Donkey, same as me, just trying to
make his way in America. He makes his deposits in the Favor Bank.
America is a wonderful country.”</p>
<p>For a moment Sherman’s spirits rose a calibration or two, but then
they sank lower than ever. It was Killian’s obvious elation that did it.
Killian was crowing over his strategic genius in “the war.” He had
conducted a successful sortie of some kind. To Killian this was a game.
If he won, terrific. If he lost…well, on to the next war. For him,
Sherman, there was nothing to be won. He had already lost almost
everything, irretrievably. At best, he could only keep from losing
all.</p>
<p>The telephone rang in the library. Sherman braced once more, but soon
Occhioni was at the doorway again.</p>
<p>“It’s some guy named Pollard Browning, Mr. McCoy.”</p>
<p>“Who’s he?” asked Killian.</p>
<p>“He lives here in the building. He’s the president of the co-op
board.”</p>
<p>He went into the library and picked up the telephone. From the street
below, another roar, more bellowing on the bullhorn…McCOY!…McCOY!…No
doubt it was just as audible chez Browning. He could imagine what
Pollard thought.</p>
<p>But his voice was friendly enough. “How you bearing up, Sherman?”</p>
<p>“Oh, all right, Pollard, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to drop up and see you, if that wouldn’t be too much of an
imposition.”</p>
<p>“You’re home?” asked Sherman.</p>
<p>“Just got here. It wasn’t easy, getting into the building, but I made
it. Would that be all right?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Come on up.”</p>
<p>“I’ll just walk on up the fire stairs, if that’s okay. Eddie’s got
his hands full down at the front door. I don’t know if he can even hear
the buzzer.”</p>
<p>“I’ll meet you back there.”</p>
<p>He told Killian he was going back to the kitchen to let Browning
in.</p>
<p>“Ayyyy,” said Killian. “See? They haven’t forgotten you.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see,” said Sherman. “You’re about to meet Wall Street in its
pure form.”</p>
<p>Back in the big silent kitchen, with the door open, Sherman could
hear Pollard clanging up the metal treads of the fire stairs. Soon he
came into view, puffing, from his climb of all of two flights, but
impeccable. Pollard was the sort of plump forty-year-old who looks
tonier than any athlete the same age. His smooth jowls welled up from
out of a white shirt of a lustrous Sea Island cotton. A beautifully made
gray worsted suit lay upon every square inch of his buttery body without
a ripple. He wore a navy tie with the Yacht Club insignia and a pair of
black shoes so well cut they made his feet look tiny. He was as sleek as
a beaver.</p>
<p>Sherman led him out of the kitchen and into the entry gallery, where
the Irishman, McCarthy, sat in the Thomas Hope chair. The door to the
library was open and Occhioni was plainly visible in there.</p>
<p>“Bodyguards,” Sherman felt compelled to say to Pollard, in a low
voice. “I bet you never thought you’d know anybody who had
bodyguards.”</p>
<p>“One of my clients—you know Cleve Joyner of United Carborundum?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know him.”</p>
<p>“He’s had bodyguards for six or seven years now. Go with him
everywhere.”</p>
<p>In the living room, Pollard gave Killian’s fancy clothes a quick
once-over, and a pained, pinched look came over his face. Pollard said,
“How do you do?” which came out as “Howja do?” and Killian said, “How
are you?” which came out as “Hehwaya?” Pollard’s nostrils twitched
slightly, the same way Sherman’s father’s had when he mentioned the name
Dershkin, Bellavita, Fishbein andandandand Schlossel.</p>
<p>Sherman and Pollard sat down in one of the clusters of furniture Judy
had arranged in order to fill up the vast room. Killian went off into
the library to talk to Occhioni.</p>
<p>“Well, Sherman,” said Pollard, “I’ve been in touch with all the
members of the executive committee, except for Jack Morrissey, and I
want you to know you have our support, and we’ll do anything we can. I
know this must be a terrible situation for you and Judy and Campbell.”
He shook his smooth round head.</p>
<p>“Well, thank you, Pollard. It hasn’t been too terrific.”</p>
<p>“Now, I’ve been in touch with the inspector at the Nineteenth
Precinct myself, and they’ll provide protection for the front door, so
that we can get in and out, but he says he can’t keep the demonstrators
away from the building altogether. I thought they could make them stay
back five hundred feet, but he maintains they can’t do that. I think
it’s outrageous, frankly. That bunch of…” Sherman could see Pollard
ransacking his smooth round head for some courtly way to express a
racial epithet. He abandoned the effort: “…that mob.” He shook his head
a great deal more.</p>
<p>“It’s a political football, Pollard. I’m a political football. That’s
what you’ve got living up over your head.” Sherman tried a smile.
Against all his better instincts, he wanted Pollard to like him and
sympathize with him. “I hope you read the Daily News today,
Pollard.”</p>
<p>“No, I hardly ever see the Daily News. I did read the Times.”</p>
<p>“Well, read the story in the Daily News, if you can. It’s the first
piece that gives any idea of what’s really going on.”</p>
<p>Pollard shook his head more woefully still. “The press is as bad as
the demonstrators, Sherman. They’re downright abusive. They waylay you.
They waylay anybody who tries to come in here. I had to walk a goddamned
gauntlet just now to get in my own building. And then they were all over
my driver! They’re insolent! They’re a bunch of filthy little wogs.”
Wogs? “And of course the police won’t do anything about it. It’s as if
you’re fair game just because you’re fortunate enough to be living in a
building like this.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to say. I’m sorry about everything, Pollard.”</p>
<p>“Well, unfortunately…” He dropped that. “There’s never been anything
like this on Park Avenue, Sherman. I mean, a demonstration aimed at Park
Avenue as a residential area. It’s intolerable. It’s as if because this
is Park Avenue, we’re denied the sanctity of our homes. And our building
is the focus of it.”</p>
<p>Sherman experienced a neural alert as to what might be coming, but he
couldn’t be sure. He began shaking his head in time with Pollard’s, to
show his heart was in the right place.</p>
<p>Pollard said, “Apparently they intend to come here every day or stay
around the clock, until—until I don’t know what.” His head was really
going now.</p>
<p>Sherman picked up the tempo of his own head. “Who told you that?”</p>
<p>“Eddie.”</p>
<p>“Eddie, the doorman?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Also Tony, who was on duty until Eddie came on at four. He told
Eddie the same thing.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe they’ll do that, Pollard.”</p>
<p>“Until today you couldn’t have believed a bunch of—that they’d hold a
demonstration in front of our building on Park Avenue, could you? I
mean, there you are.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>“Sherman, we’ve been friends a long time. We went to Buckley
together. That was an innocent era, wasn’t it?” He smiled a small
brittle smile. “My father knew your father. So I’m talking to you as an
old friend who wants to do what he can for you. But I’m also president
of the board for all the tenants of the building, and I have a
responsibility to them that has to take precedence over my personal
preferences.”</p>
<p>Sherman could feel his face getting hot. “Which means what,
Pollard?”</p>
<p>“Well, just this. I can’t imagine this is in any way a comfortable
situation for you, being held virtual prisoner in this building. Have
you considered…changing residence? Until things quiet down a bit?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ve thought about it. Judy and Campbell and our housekeeper and
the nanny are staying over at my parents’ now. Frankly, I’m already
terrified that those bastards out there are going to find out and go
over there and do something, and a town house is completely exposed.
I’ve thought about going out to Long Island, but you’ve seen our house.
It’s wide open. French doors everywhere. It wouldn’t keep a chipmunk
out. I’ve thought of a hotel, but there’s no such thing as security in a
hotel. I’ve thought of staying at the Leash, but that’s a town house,
too. Pollard, I’m getting death threats. Death threats. There’ve been at
least a dozen calls today.”</p>
<p>Pollard’s little eyes swiveled swiftly about the room, as if They
might be coming in the windows. “Well, frankly…all the more reason,
Sherman.”</p>
<p>“Reason for what?”</p>
<p>“Well, that you should consider…making some arrangements. You know,
it’s not just yourself who is at risk. Everyone in this building is at
risk, Sherman. I realize it’s not your fault, not directly, certainly,
but that doesn’t alter the facts.”</p>
<p>Sherman knew his face was blazing red. “Alter the facts! The facts
are that my life is being threatened, and this is the most secure place
available to me, and it also happens to be my home, if I may remind you
of that fact.”</p>
<p>“Well, let me remind you—and again, I’m only doing this because I
have a higher responsibility—let me remind you that you have a home here
because you are a shareholder in a cooperative residential venture. It’s
called a cooperative for a reason, and certain obligations, on your part
and the board’s part, proceed from the contract you executed when you
purchased your shares. There’s no way I can alter those facts.”</p>
<p>“I’m at the most critical juncture in my life—and you’re spouting
contract law?”</p>
<p>“Sherman…” Pollard cast his eyes down and threw his hands up, most
sadly. “I have to think not only of you and your family but of thirteen
other families in this building. And we’re not asking you to do anything
of a permanent nature.”</p>
<p>We! We the Jury—inside the walls!</p>
<p>“Well, why don’t you move out, Pollard, if you’re so fucking
terrified? Why don’t you and the entire executive committee move out?
I’m sure your shining example will inspire the others, and they’ll move
out, and no one will be at risk in your beloved building except the
damnable McCoys, who created all the problems in the first place,
right!”</p>
<p>Occhioni and Killian were peering in from the doorway to the library,
and McCarthy was looking in from out in the entry gallery. But he
couldn’t rein himself in.</p>
<p>“Sherman—”</p>
<p>“Move…out? Have you any idea what a pompous preposterous jerk you
are? Coming in here, scared to death, and telling me the board in its
wisdom deems it proper for me to…move out?”</p>
<p>“Sherman, I know you’re excited—”</p>
<p>“Move…out? The only one who’s moving out, Pollard, is you! You’re
moving out of this apartment—right now! And you’re going out the way you
came—out the kitchen door!” He pointed a ramrod arm and forefinger in
the direction of the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Sherman, I came up here in good faith.”</p>
<p>“Awwwwww, Pollard…You were a ridiculous fat blowhard at Buckley and
you’re a ridiculous fat blowhard now. I’ve got enough on my mind without
your good faith. Goodbye, Pollard.” He took him by the elbow and tried
to turn him toward the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Don’t you put a hand on me!”</p>
<p>Sherman took his hand away. Seething: “Then get out.”</p>
<p>“Sherman, you’re not leaving us any choice but to enforce the
provision concerning Unacceptable Situations.”</p>
<p>The ramrod pointed to the kitchen and said softly: “March, Pollard.
If I hear one more word from you between here and those fire stairs,
there’s gonna be an unacceptable situation sure enough.”</p>
<p>Pollard’s head seemed to swell up apoplectically. Then he turned and
strode rapidly through the entry gallery and into the kitchen. Sherman
followed him, as noisily as he could.</p>
<p>When Pollard reached the sanctuary of the fire stairs, he turned and,
furious, said: “Just remember, Sherman. You called the tune.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Called the tune.’ Terrific. You’re a real phrasemaker, Pollard!”
He slammed the kitchen’s old metal fire door.</p>
<p>Almost immediately he regretted the whole thing. As he walked back to
the living room, his heart was beating violently. He was trembling. The
three men, Killian, Occhioni, and McCarthy, were standing about with a
mime-show nonchalance.</p>
<p>Sherman made himself smile, just to show everything was all
right.</p>
<p>“Friend a yours?” said Killian.</p>
<p>“Yes, an old friend. I went to school with him. He wants to throw me
out of the building.”</p>
<p>“Fat chance,” said Killian. “We can fucking tie him up in knots for
the next ten years.”</p>
<p>“You know, I have a confession to make,” said Sherman. He made
himself smile again. “Until that sonofabitch came up here, I was
thinking of blowing my brains out. Now I wouldn’t dream of it. That
would solve all his problems, and he’d dine out on it for a month and be
damned sanctimonious while he was at it. He’d tell everybody how we grew
up together, and he’d shake that big round bubble head of his. I think
I’ll invite those bastards”—he motioned toward the streets—“on up here
and let ’em dance the mazurka right over his big bubble head.”</p>
<p>“Ayyyyyy,” said Killian. “That’s better. Now you’re turning fucking
Irish. The Irish been living the last twelve hundred years on dreams of
revenge. Now you’re talking, bro.”</p>
<p>Another roar rose from Park Avenue in the heat of
June…McCOY!…McCOY!…McCOY!</p>
