<h4 id="inside-the-cavity">23. Inside the Cavity</h4>
<p>“Well, there you are, Larry,” said Abe Weiss with a big grin. “They
sure gave you a shiny dome.” Since Weiss was now inviting him to do it,
Kramer did what he had been wanting to do for the past forty-five
seconds, which was to turn completely away from Weiss and look at the
bank of television sets on the wall.</p>
<p>And there, indeed, he was.</p>
<p>The videocassette had just reached the part in the Channel 1
broadcast from last night in which the artist’s drawing showed the scene
in the courtroom. The sound was on low, but Kramer could hear the voice
of the announcer, Robert Corso, as if he were right inside his skull:
“Assistant District Attorney Lawrence Kramer thrust the petition toward
Judge Samuel Auerbach and said, ‘Your Honor, the people of the Bronx…’”
In the drawing, the top of his head was absolutely bald, which was
unrealistic and unfair, because he was not bald, he was only balding.
Nevertheless, there he was. It was not one of Those People We See on TV.
It was himself, and if there was ever a powerful warrior for Justice, it
was himself on that screen. His neck, his shoulders, his chest, his
arms—they were huge, as if he were heaving the 16-pound shot in the
Olympics instead of waving a few pieces of paper at Sammy Auerbach.
True, one reason he looked so big was that the drawing was a little out
of proportion, but that was probably the way the artist had seen him:
Larger Than Life. The artist…What a juicy Italian girl she had been…Lips
like nectarines…Nice breasts underneath a shiny silky jersey…Lucy
Dellafloria, her name was…If there hadn’t been such commotion and
confusion, it would have been the easiest thing in the world. After all,
she had sat there in the courtroom concentrating on him, at center
stage, absorbed in the look of him, in the passion of his presentation,
the confidence of his performance on the field of battle. She had been
absorbed as an artist and as a woman…with full Italian Dirty Girl
lips…in himself.</p>
<p>All too soon, just like that, the drawing was gone and Weiss was on
the screen with a whole forest of microphones sticking up at him. The
microphones had been on little metal stands on his desk, for the press
conference he gave right after the arraignment. He had given another one
this morning. Weiss knew exactly how to keep the focus on himself. Oh
yes. The average TV watcher would assume that the show was all Abe
Weiss’s and that the assistant district attorney who presented the case
in the courtroom, this Larry Kramer, was merely the instrument of Abe
Weiss’s gravel-voiced strategic brilliance. Weiss hadn’t actually worked
on his feet in a courtroom the whole time he had been in office, which
was almost four years. But Kramer didn’t resent that; or not very much.
That was the given. That was the way it worked. It was thus in every
district attorney’s office, not just Weiss’s. No, on this particular
morning Captain Ahab was okay with Kramer. The TV news and the
newspapers had featured the name Lawrence Kramer many times, and she,
luscious Lucy Dellafloria, sexy Lucy Delicate Flower, had done his
portrait and captured the mighty Kramer form. No, it was fine. And Weiss
had just gone to the trouble of pointing that out to him, by playing the
videocassette. The implicit message was: “All right, I make myself the
star, because I run this office and I am the one who has to face
reelection. But see, I don’t leave you out. You get the second
billing.”</p>
<p>So the two of them watched the rest of the Channel 1 coverage on the
television set on the paneled wall. There was Thomas Killian standing
outside the Criminal Courts Building with the microphones held up at his
face.</p>
<p>“Look at those fucking clothes,” muttered Weiss. “Looks fucking
ridiculous.” What crossed Kramer’s mind was how much such clothes must
cost.</p>
<p>Killian was going on about how this was a “circus arrest” and a
“circus arraignment.” He appeared to be extremely angry.</p>
<p>“We reached an agreement with the district attorney yesterday that
Mr. McCoy would present himself for arraignment here in the Bronx,
peacefully, voluntarily, this morning, and the district attorney chose
to violate that agreement and bring Mr. McCoy in like a violent felon,
like an animal—and for what? For your cameras and for votes.”</p>
<p>“Gedoudahere,” Weiss said to the screen.</p>
<p>Killian was saying, “Mr. McCoy not only denies these charges, but he
is eager for the facts in this case to come out, and when they come out,
you will see that the scenario that is being contrived for this case is
utterly without foundation.”</p>
<p>“Blah blah blah,” Weiss said to the screen.</p>
<p>The camera moved to a figure standing just behind Killian. It was
McCoy. His tie was loose and pulled to one side. His shirt and jacket
were rumpled. His hair was matted. He looked half drowned. His eyes
rolled up, toward the sky. He didn’t look all there.</p>
<p>Now Robert Corso’s face was on the screen, and he was talking about
McCoy, McCoy, McCoy. It was no longer the Lamb case. It was the McCoy
case. The big Wall Street Wasp with the aristocratic profile had given
the case some sex appeal. The press couldn’t get enough of it.</p>
<p>Weiss’s desk was covered with newspapers. He still had yesterday
afternoon’s City Light right up on top. In enormous letters the front
page said:</p>
<p>Wall Street</p>
<p>Socialite</p>
<p>Nabbed In</p>
<p>Hit-And-Run</p>
<p>The words were banked up against a tall narrow picture of McCoy,
soaking wet, with his hands in front of him and his suit jacket folded
over his hands, obviously to hide his handcuffs. He had his big handsome
chin up, and a ferocious scowl beamed straight down his nose at the
camera. He looked as if he was saying, “Yeah, and what of it?” Even the
Times had the case on the front page this morning, but it was The City
Light that was really going wild. The headline this morning said:</p>
<p>Seek</p>
<p>“Foxy”</p>
<p>Brunette</p>
<p>Mystery</p>
<p>Girl</p>
<p>A smaller headline up above said, Team Mercedes: He Hit, She Ran. The
picture was the one from the social magazine, W, the one Roland Auburn
had pointed to, the one of McCoy in his tuxedo, grinning, and of his
wife, looking proper and plain. The caption said, Eyewitness called
McCoy’s companion younger, more “foxy,” a “hotter ticket” than his
forty-year-old wife, Judy, shown here with hubby at charity bash. A line
of white letters on a black bar at the bottom of the page said,
Protesters Demand “Jail, Not Bail” for Wall Street Whiz. See page 3.
And: Chez McCoy and Chez Lamb: A Tale of Two Cities. Pictures, pages 4
and 5. On pages 4 and 5 were pictures of McCoy’s Park Avenue spread, the
ones from Architectural Digest, on one side and pictures of the Lambs’
tiny rooms in the project on the other. A long caption began: Two vastly
different New Yorks collided when Wall Street investment banker Sherman
McCoy’s 0,000 Mercedes-Benz sports roadster struck honor student Henry
Lamb. McCoy lives in a million, 14-room, two-story apartment on Park
Avenue. Lamb, in a 47-a-month three-room apartment in a housing project
in the South Bronx.</p>
<p>Weiss loved every square inch of the coverage. It had blown all this
talk of “white justice” and “Johannesbronx” right out of the tub. They
hadn’t managed to jack McCoy’s bail up to 50,000, but they had gone
after that aggressively. Aggressively? Kramer smiled. Sammy Auerbach’s
eyes had opened up like a pair of umbrellas when he had waved the
petition at him. That had been just a shade outrageous, but it had
gotten the point across. The Bronx D.A.’s Office was in touch with the
people. And they would keep petitioning for higher bail.</p>
<p>No, Weiss was pleased. That was obvious. This was the first time
Kramer had ever been summoned into Weiss’s office by himself, without
Bernie Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>Weiss pressed a button, and the television set went blank. He said to
Kramer, “Did you see the way McCoy looked standing there? He looked like
a fucking mess. Milt said that’s the way he looked when he came in the
courtroom yesterday. He said he looked like hell. What was that all
about?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Kramer, “all it was was, it was raining. He got wet
while he was standing in line outside of Central Booking. They made him
wait in line like everybody else, which was the whole point. Not to give
him special treatment.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said Weiss, “but f’r Chrissake, here we’re bringing Park
Avenue into the courtroom, and Milt says the guy looked like he was just
fished out of the river. Bernie was giving me a hard time about that,
too. He didn’t want to take him through Central Booking in the first
place.”</p>
<p>“He didn’t look all that bad, Mr. Weiss,” said Kramer.</p>
<p>“Make it Abe.”</p>
<p>Kramer nodded, but decided he would wait a decent interval before
trying out his first Abe. “He didn’t look any different from anybody
else who comes in from out of the pens.”</p>
<p>“And there’s Tommy Killian trying to raise a big stink about it,
too.” He gestured toward the television sets.</p>
<p>Kramer thought, Well, you finally stood up on your hind legs against
the two Donkeys. Bernie had been unhappy, to put it mildly, when Weiss
overruled him and ordered Kramer to request that McCoy’s bail be raised
from 0,000 to 50,000 after Bernie had struck a deal at 0,000 with
Killian. Weiss told Bernie it was only to placate the angry residents of
the community who thought McCoy would get special treatment and that he
knew Auerbach wouldn’t actually set such a high bail. But to Bernie it
was a breach of contract, a violation of Favor Bank regulations, of the
sacred code of loyalty of one Harp to another in the criminal justice
system.</p>
<p>Kramer could see a cloud passing in front of Weiss’s face, and then
Weiss said, “Well, let Tommy squawk. You can drive yourself crazy if you
try to please everybody. I had to make a decision and I made a decision.
Bernie likes Tommy, and that’s okay. I like Tommy myself. But Bernie
wants to give him the goddamned store! The promises he made Tommy, McCoy
was gonna come traipsing through here like Prince Charles. How long was
McCoy in the pens?”</p>
<p>“Oh, about four hours.”</p>
<p>“Well, hell, that’s about normal, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“About. I’ve seen defendants get shuttled from one precinct lockup to
another and then to Central Booking and then to Rikers Island and then
back to Central Booking, and then they get arraigned. They get arrested
on a Friday evening, they can spend the whole weekend bouncing around.
Then you’re looking at somebody who’s a mess. McCoy didn’t even have to
start off in a precinct house and get bused over to Central
Booking.”</p>
<p>“Well then, I don’t know what all this goddamned bellyaching is. Did
anything happen to him in the pens? What’s the big deal?”</p>
<p>“Nothing happened. The computer went down, I think. So there was a
delay. But that happens all the time, too. That’s normal.”</p>
<p>“You wanna know what I think? I think Bernie, without knowing
it—don’t get me wrong, I like Bernie and I respect Bernie—but I think,
without knowing it, he really does think someone like McCoy should get
special treatment, because he’s white and because he’s well known. Now,
this is a subtle thing. Bernie’s Irish, just like Tommy’s Irish, and the
Irish have a certain amount of what the English call deference built
into them, and they don’t even know it. They’re impressed by these Waspy
guys, like McCoy, even though consciously they may act and think like
they’re members of the IRA. It’s not really important, but a guy like
Bernie’s got this deference thing to deal with, this unconscious Irish
thing, and he doesn’t even know about it. But we don’t represent the
Wasps, Larry. I wonder if there’s even a Wasp living in the Bronx. There
must be one in Riverdale somewhere.”</p>
<p>Kramer chuckled.</p>
<p>“No, I’m serious,” said Weiss. “This is the Bronx. This is the
Laboratory of Human Relations. That’s what I call it, the Laboratory of
Human Relations.”</p>
<p>That was true; he called it the Laboratory of Human Relations. He
called it that every day, as if oblivious of the fact that everyone who
had ever been in his office had heard him say it before. But Kramer was
in the mood to forgive Weiss’s fatuous side. More than forgive…to
understand…and appreciate the essential truth that underlay his
buffoon’s way of putting things. Weiss was right. You couldn’t run the
criminal justice system in the Bronx and pretend you were in some kind
of displaced Manhattan.</p>
<p>“Come here,” said Weiss. He got up from his great chair and walked
over to the window behind him and beckoned to Kramer. From up here on
the sixth floor, at the top of the hill, the view was grand. They were
up high enough so that all sordid details receded and the Bronx’s lovely
rolling topology took over. They looked out over Yankee Stadium and John
Mullaly Park, which from up here actually looked green and sylvan. In
the distance, straight ahead, across the Harlem River, was the skyline
of upper Manhattan, up where Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center was,
and from here it looked pastoral, like one of those old landscape
paintings in which they put some fuzzy trees in the background and some
soft gray clouds.</p>
<p>Weiss said, “Look down there on those streets, Larry. Whaddaya see?
Whodaya see?”</p>
<p>All that Kramer could see, in fact, were some tiny figures walking
along 161st Street and Walton Avenue. They were so far below they were
like insects.</p>
<p>“They’re all black and Puerto Rican,” said Weiss. “You don’t even see
any old Jews walking around down there anymore or any Italians, either,
and this is the civic center of the Bronx. This is like Montague Street
in Brooklyn or City Hall Plaza in Manhattan. In the summertime the Jews
used to sit out on the sidewalk at night right over there on the Grand
Concourse and just watch the cars go by. You couldn’t get Charles
Bronson to sit out there now. This is the modern era, and nobody
understands it yet. When I was a kid, the Irish ran the Bronx. They ran
it for a long time. You remember Charlie Buckley? Charlie Buckley, the
congressman? No, you’re too young. Charlie Buckley, the Boss of the
Bronx, as Irish as they come. Up to about thirty years ago Charlie
Buckley was still running the Bronx. And now they’re finished, and so
who runs it? Jews and Italians. But for how long? There’s none down
there on the street, and so how long are they gonna be up here in this
building? But that’s the Bronx, the Laboratory of Human Relations.
That’s what I call it, the Laboratory of Human Relations. Those are poor
people you’re looking at down there, Larry, and poverty breeds crime,
and the crime in this borough—well, I don’t have to tell you. Part of
me’s an idealist. I want to deal with every case on an individual basis
and every person one by one. But with the caseload we got?
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyy…The other part of me knows that what we’re really doing,
we’re like a little band of cowboys running a herd. With a herd the best
you can hope for is to keep the herd as a whole”—he made a great round
gesture with his hands—“under control and hope you don’t lose too many
along the way. Oh, the day will come, and maybe pretty soon, when those
people down there will have their own leaders and their own
organizations, and they’ll be the Bronx Democratic Party and everything
else, and we won’t be in this building any longer. But right now they
need us, and we have to do the right thing by them. We have to let them
know that we’re not removed from them and that they’re just as much a
part of New York as we are. We have to send them the right signals. We
have to let them know that maybe we come down hard on them when they get
out of line, but it’s not because they’re black or Hispanic or poor. We
got to let them know justice really is blind. We got to let them know if
you’re white and rich, it works out the same way. That’s a very
important signal. It’s more important than any specific point or
technicality of the law. That is what this office is all about, Larry.
We’re not here to handle cases. We’re here to create hope. That’s what
Bernie doesn’t understand.” The doesn’t, in preference to the Irish
don’t, signaled the elevation of the D.A.’s thoughts at this moment.
“Bernie is still playing Irish politics,” said Weiss, “the same way
Charlie Buckley used to play it, and that’s finished. It’s all over.
This is the modern era in the Laboratory of Human Relations, and we have
a sworn duty to represent those people you’re looking at down
there.”</p>
<p>Kramer peered down diligently at the insects. As for Weiss, the
loftiness of his sentiments had filled his voice and his face with
emotion. He gave Kramer a sincere look and a tired smile, the sort of
look that says, “That’s what life is all about, once the petty
considerations have been swept away.”</p>
<p>“I never thought about it that way before, Abe,” said Kramer, “but
you’re absolutely right.” It seemed like a good moment for the first
Abe.</p>
<p>“I was worried about this McCoy case at the beginning,” said Weiss.
“It looked like Bacon and those people were forcing the issue, and all
we were doing was reacting. But that’s okay. It turned out to be a good
thing. How do we treat some hotshot from Park Avenue? Like anybody else,
that’s how! He gets arrested, he gets the cuffs, he gets booked, he gets
fingerprinted, he waits in the pens, just like anybody down there on
those streets! Now, I think that sends a helluva good signal. It lets
those people know we represent them and they’re a part a New York
City.”</p>
<p>Weiss gazed down upon 161st Street like a shepherd upon his flock.
Kramer was glad no one but himself was witnessing this. If more than one
witness had been on hand, then cynicism would have reigned. You wouldn’t
have been able to think about anything other than the fact that Abe
Weiss had an election coming up in five months, and 70 percent of the
inhabitants of the Bronx were black and Latin. But since there was, in
fact, no other witness, Kramer could get to the heart of the matter,
which was that the manic creature before him, Captain Ahab, was
right.</p>
<p>“You did a great job yesterday, Larry,” said Weiss, “and I want you
to keep pouring it on. Doesn’t it make you feel good to use your talents
for something that means something? Christ, you know what I make.” That
Kramer did. It was 2,000 a year. “A dozen times I coulda taken a fork in
the road and gone out and made three times, five times that in private
practice. But for what? You only pass this way once, Larry. Whaddaya
wanna be remembered for? That you had a fucking mansion in Riverdale or
Greenwich or Locust Valley? Or that you made a difference? I feel sorry
for Tommy Killian. He was a good assistant D.A., but Tommy wanted to
make some money, and so now he’s out making some money, but how? He’s
holding the hands and wiping the noses of a buncha wise guys,
psychotics, and dopers. A guy like McCoy makes him look good. He hasn’t
seen a guy like that in all the years he’s been outta here. No, I’d
rather run the Laboratory of Human Relations. That’s the way I think of
it. I’d rather make a difference.”</p>
<p>You did a great job yesterday. And I want you to keep pouring it
on.</p>
<p>“Christ, I wonder what time it is,” said Weiss. “I’m getting
hungry.”</p>
<p>Kramer looked at his watch with alacrity. “Almost 12:15.”</p>
<p>“Whyn’t you stick around and have lunch? Judge Tonneto’s coming by,
and this guy from the Times, Overton Something-or-other—I always forget,
they’re all named Overton or Clifton or some fucking name like that—and
Bobby Vitello and Lew Weintraub. You know Lew Weintraub? No? Stick
around. You’ll learn something.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you’re sure…”</p>
<p>“Of course!” Weiss motioned toward his gigantic conference table, as
if to say there’s plenty of room. “Just ordering in some
sandwiches.”</p>
<p>He said this as if this happened to be one of those
spur-of-the-moment lunches where you order in instead of going out, as
if he or any other shepherd from the island fortress dared stroll out
amid the flock and have lunch in the civic center of the Bronx.</p>
<p>But Kramer banished all cheap cynicism from his thoughts. Lunch with
the likes of Judge Tonneto, Bobby Vitello, Lew Weintraub, the
real-estate developer, Overton Whichever Wasp of The New York Times, and
the district attorney himself!</p>
<p>He was emerging from the anonymous ooze.</p>
<p>Thank God for the Great White Defendant. Thank you, God, for
Mr. Sherman McCoy.</p>
<p>With a blink of curiosity, he wondered about McCoy. McCoy wasn’t much
older than he was. How did this little icy dip into the real world feel
to a Wasp who had had everything just the way he wanted it all his life?
But it was only that, a blink.</p>
<p>The Bororo Indians, a primitive tribe who live along the Vermelho
River in the Amazon jungles of Brazil, believe that there is no such
thing as a private self. The Bororos regard the mind as an open cavity,
like a cave or a tunnel or an arcade, if you will, in which the entire
village dwells and the jungle grows. In 1969 José M. R. Delgado, the
eminent Spanish brain physiologist, pronounced the Bororos correct. For
nearly three millennia, Western philosophers had viewed the self as
something unique, something encased inside each person’s skull, so to
speak. This inner self had to deal with and learn from the outside
world, of course, and it might prove incompetent in doing so.
Nevertheless, at the core of one’s self there was presumed to be
something irreducible and inviolate. Not so, said Delgado. “Each person
is a transitory composite of materials borrowed from the environment.”
The important word was transitory, and he was talking not about years
but about hours. He cited experiments in which healthy college students
lying on beds in well-lit but soundproofed chambers, wearing gloves to
reduce the sense of touch and translucent goggles to block out specific
sights, began to hallucinate within hours. Without the entire village,
the whole jungle, occupying the cavity, they had no minds left.</p>
<p>He cited no investigations of the opposite case, however. He did not
discuss what happens when one’s self—or what one takes to be one’s
self—is not a mere cavity open to the outside world but has suddenly
become an amusement park to which everybody, todo el mundo, tout le
monde, comes scampering, skipping, and screaming, nerves a-tingle, loins
aflame, ready for anything, all you’ve got, laughs, tears, moans, giddy
thrills, gasps, horrors, whatever, the gorier the merrier. Which is to
say, he told us nothing of the mind of a person at the center of a
scandal in the last quarter of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>At first, in the weeks following the incident in the Bronx, Sherman
McCoy had regarded the press as an enemy that was stalking him out
there. He feared each day’s newspapers and news broadcasts the way a man
would fear the weapons of any impersonal and unseen enemy, the way he
would fear falling bombs or incoming shells. Even yesterday, outside the
Central Booking facility, in the rain and the filth, when he saw the
whites of their eyes and the yellow of their teeth and they reviled and
taunted and baited him, when they did everything short of trampling and
spitting upon him, they were still the enemy out there. They had closed
in for the kill, and they hurt him and humiliated him, but they could
not reach his inviolable self, Sherman McCoy, inside the brass crucible
of his mind.</p>
<p>They closed in for the kill. And then they killed him.</p>
<p>He couldn’t remember whether he had died while he was still standing
in line outside, before the door to Central Booking opened, or while he
was in the pens. But by the time he left the building and Killian held
his impromptu press conference on the steps, he had died and been
reborn. In his new incarnation, the press was no longer an enemy and it
was no longer out there. The press was now a condition, like lupus
erythematosus or Wegener’s granulomatosis. His entire central nervous
system was now wired into the vast, incalculable circuit of radio and
television and newspapers, and his body surged and burned and hummed
with the energy of the press and the prurience of those it reached,
which was everyone, from the closest neighbor to the most bored and
distant outlander titillated for the moment by his disgrace. By the
thousands, no, the millions, they now came scampering into the cavity of
what he had presumed to be his self, Sherman McCoy. He could no more
keep them from entering his very own hide than he could keep the air out
of his lungs. (Or, better said, he could keep them out only in the same
manner that he could deny air to his lungs once and for all. That
solution occurred to him more than once during that long day, but he
fought against morbidity, he did, he did, he did, he who had already
died once.)</p>
<p>It started within minutes after he and Killian managed to disengage
themselves from the mob of demonstrators and reporters and photographers
and camera crews and get into the car-service sedan Killian had hired.
The driver was listening to an Easy Listening station on the car radio,
but in no time the every-half-hour news broadcast came on, and right
away Sherman heard his name, his name and all the key words that he
would hear and see over and over for the rest of the day: Wall Street,
socialite, hit-and-run, Bronx honor student, unidentified female
companion, and he could see the driver’s eyes in the rearview mirror
staring into the open cavity known as Sherman McCoy. By the time they
reached Killian’s office, the midday edition of The City Light was
already there, and his contorted face was staring back at him from the
front page, and everyone in New York was free to walk right in through
those horrified eyes of his. Late in the afternoon, when he went home to
Park Avenue, he had to run a gauntlet of reporters and television camera
crews to get into his own apartment building. They called him “Sherman,”
as merrily and contemptuously and imperiously as they pleased, and
Eddie, the doorman, looked into his eyes and stuck his head way down
into the cavity. To make matters worse, he had to ride up on the
elevator with the Morrisseys, who lived in the penthouse apartment. They
said nothing. They just poked their long noses inside the cavity and
sniffed and sniffed at his shame, until their faces stiffened from the
stench. He had counted on his unlisted telephone number as a retreat,
but the press had already solved that, by the time he got home, and
Bonita, kind Bonita, who took only a quick peek inside the cavity, had
to screen the calls. Every imaginable news organization called, and
there were a few calls for Judy. And for himself? Who would be so
deficient in dignity, so immune to embarrassment, as to make a personal
telephone call to this great howling public arcade, this shell of shame
and funk, which was Sherman McCoy himself? Only his mother and father
and Rawlie Thorpe. Well, at least Rawlie had that much in him.
Judy—roaming the apartment shocked and distant. Campbell—bewildered but
not in tears; not yet. He hadn’t thought he would be able to face the
television screen, and yet he turned it on. The vilification poured
forth from every channel. Prominent Wall Street investment banker, top
echelon at Pierce andandandand Pierce, socialite, prep school, Yale,
spoiled son of the former general partner of Dunning Sponget
andandandand Leach, the Wall Street law firm, in his 0,000 Mercedes
sports roadster (now an extra 0,000), with a foxy brunette who was not
his wife and not anything like his wife and who makes his wife look
dowdy by comparison, runs over an exemplary son of the deserving poor, a
young honor student who grew up in the housing projects, and flees in
his fancy car without so much as a moment’s pity, let alone help, for
his victim, who now lies near death. The eerie thing was—and it felt
eerie as he had sat there looking at the television set—was that he was
not shocked and angered by these gross distortions and manifest
untruths. Instead, he was shamed. By nightfall they had been repeated so
often, on the vast circuit to which his very hide now seemed wired, that
they had taken on the weight of truth, in that millions had now seen
this Sherman McCoy, this Sherman McCoy on the screen, and they knew him
to be the man who had committed the heartless act. They were here now,
in vast mobs, clucking and fuming and probably contemplating worse than
that, inside the public arcade that he had once thought to be the
private self of Sherman McCoy. Everyone, every living soul who gazed
upon him, with the possible exception of Maria, if she ever gazed upon
him again, would know him as this person on the front of two million,
three million, four million newspapers and on the screen of God knew how
many million television sets. The energy of their accusations, borne
over the vast circuit of the press, which was wired into his central
nervous system, hummed and burned through his hide and made his
adrenaline pump. His pulse was constantly fast, and yet he was no longer
in a state of panic. A sad, sad torpor had set in. He could concentrate
on…nothing, not even long enough to feel sad about it. He thought of
what this must be doing to Campbell and to Judy, and yet he no longer
felt the terrible pangs he felt before…before he died. This alarmed him.
He looked at his daughter and tried to feel the pangs, but it was an
intellectual exercise. It was all so sad and heavy, heavy, heavy.</p>
<p>The one thing he truly felt was fear. It was the fear of going back
in there.</p>
<p>Last night, exhausted, he went to bed and thought he would be unable
to sleep. In fact, he fell asleep almost at once and had a dream. It was
dusk. He was on a bus going up First Avenue. This was odd, because he
had not taken a bus in New York for at least ten years. Before he knew
it, the bus was up around 110th Street, and it was dark. He had missed
his stop, although he couldn’t remember what his stop was supposed to
be. He was now in a black neighborhood. In fact, it should have been a
Latin neighborhood, namely, Spanish Harlem, but it was a black
neighborhood. He got off the bus, fearing that if he stayed on, things
would only get worse. In doorways, on stoops, on the sidewalks he could
see figures in the gloom, but they hadn’t seen him yet. He hurried along
the streets in the shadows, trying to make his way west. Good sense
would have told him to head straight back down First Avenue, but it
seemed terribly important to head west. Now he realized the figures were
circling. They said nothing, they didn’t even come terribly close…for
the time being. They had all the time in the world. He hurried through
the darkness, seeking out the shadows, and gradually the figures closed
in; gradually for they had all the time in the world. He woke up in a
dreadful panic, perspiring, his heart leaping out of his chest. He had
been asleep for less than two hours.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, as the sun came up, he felt stronger. The
humming and burning had ceased, and he began to wonder: Am I free of
this dreadful condition? Of course, he hadn’t understood. The vast
circuit was merely down for the night. The millions of accusing eyes
were closed. In any event, he decided: I will be strong. What other
choice did he have? He had none, other than to die again, slowly or
quickly; and truly. It was in that frame of mind that he decided he
would not be a prisoner in his own apartment. He would lead his life as
best he could and set his jaw against the mob. He would start by taking
Campbell to the bus stop, as always.</p>
<p>At 7:00, Tony, the doorman, called upstairs, with apologies, to say
that about a half dozen reporters and photographers were camped outside,
on the sidewalk and in cars. Bonita relayed the message, and Sherman
squared his jaw and raised his chin and resolved to deal with them the
same way you would deal with foul weather. The two of them, Sherman in
his most uncompromising nailhead worsted suit from England and Campbell
in her Taliaferro school uniform, got off the elevator and approached
the door, and Tony said, with genuine feeling, “Good luck. They’re a
rude lot.” Out on the sidewalk the first one was a very young man,
babyish in appearance, and he approached with something resembling
politeness and said, “Mr. McCoy, I’d like to ask you—”</p>
<p>Sherman took Campbell’s hand and raised his Yale chin and said, “I
have no comment whatsoever. Now, if you’ll just excuse me.”</p>
<p>Suddenly five, six, seven of them were all around him and around
Campbell, and there was no more “Mr. McCoy.”</p>
<p>“Sherman! One minute! Who was the woman?”</p>
<p>“Sherman! Hold it a second! Just one picture!”</p>
<p>“Hey, Sherman! Your lawyer says—”</p>
<p>“Hold it! Hey! Hey! What’s your name, Pretty?”</p>
<p>One of them was calling Campbell Pretty! Appalled and furious, he
turned toward the voice. The same one—with the tangles of kinky hair
pasted on his skull—and now two pieces of toilet paper on his cheek.</p>
<p>Sherman turned back to Campbell. A confused smile was on her face.
The cameras! Picture-taking had always meant a happy occasion.</p>
<p>“What’s her name, Sherman!”</p>
<p>“Hi, Pretty, what’s your name?”</p>
<p>The filthy one with the toilet paper on his face was bending over his
little girl and speaking in an unctuous avuncular voice.</p>
<p>“Leave her alone!” said Sherman. He could see the fear come into
Campbell’s face with the sharpness of his own voice.</p>
<p>All at once a microphone was in front of his nose, blocking his
vision.</p>
<p>A tall sinewy young woman with big jaws: “Henry Lamb lies near death
in the hospital, and you’re walking down Park Avenue. How do you feel
about Henry—”</p>
<p>Sherman swung his forearm up to knock the microphone out of his face.
The woman began screaming:</p>
<p>“You big bastard!” To her colleagues: “You saw that! He hit me! The
sonofabitch hit me! You saw that! You saw it! I’m having you arrested
for assault, you sonofabitch!”</p>
<p>The pack swarmed about them, Sherman and his little girl. He reached
down and put his arm around Campbell’s shoulders and tried to pull her
close to him and walk quickly toward the corner at the same time.</p>
<p>“Come on, Sherman! Just a couple a questions and we’ll let you
go!”</p>
<p>From behind, the woman was still bellowing and whining: “Hey, you get
a picture a that? I wanna see what you got! That’s evidence! You gotta
show it to me!” Then down the street: “You don’t care who you hit, do
you, you racist fuck!”</p>
<p>Racist fuck! The woman was white.</p>
<p>Campbell’s face was frozen in fear and consternation.</p>
<p>The light changed, and the pack followed the two of them and pigged
and hived about them all the way across Park Avenue. Sherman and
Campbell, hand in hand, plowed on straight ahead, and the reporters and
photographers who surrounded them scampered backward and sideways and
crabwise.</p>
<p>“Sherman!”</p>
<p>“Sherman!”</p>
<p>“Look at me, Pretty!”</p>
<p>The parents, nannies, and children waiting at the Taliaferro bus stop
shrank back. They wanted no part of the disgusting eruption they saw
coming toward them, this noisy swarm of shame, guilt, humiliation, and
torment. On the other hand, they also didn’t want their little ones to
miss the bus, which was approaching. So they shuddered and retreated a
few feet into a clump, as if blown together by the wind. For a moment
Sherman thought someone might step in to help, not so much for his sake
as for Campbell’s, but he was mistaken. Some stared, as if they didn’t
know who he was. Others averted their eyes. Sherman scanned their faces.
The lovely little Mrs. Lueger! She had both hands on the shoulders of
her little girl, who stared with big, fascinated eyes. Mrs. Lueger
looked at him as if he were a vagrant from the Sixty-seventh Street
Armory.</p>
<p>Campbell, in her little burgundy uniform, trudged up the steps into
the interior of the bus and then cast one last look over her shoulders.
Tears streamed down her face, without a sound.</p>
<p>Now a pang tore through Sherman’s solar plexus. He had not yet died
again. He was not yet dead for a second time; not yet. The photographer
with the toilet paper on his cheek was right behind him, not eighteen
inches away, with his horrible instrument screwed into his eye
socket.</p>
<p>Grab him! Drive it into his brain! “Hey, Pretty!” you dare say to my
flesh and blood—</p>
<p>But what was the use? For they weren’t the enemy out there any
longer, were they? They were parasites inside his very hide. The humming
and the burning began again for the day.</p>
<p>Fallow sauntered across the city room and let them drink in his
imposing figure. He held in his midsection and straightened his back.
Tomorrow he would begin a serious exercise regimen. There was no reason
why he shouldn’t have a heroic physique. On the way downtown he had
stopped off at Herzfeld, a haberdashery on Madison Avenue that carried
European and British clothes, and he had bought a spotted navy
silk-grenadine necktie. The tiny spots were embroidered in white. He had
put it on right there in the store, letting the salesman get a load of
his detachable collar. He was wearing his best shirt, which was from
Bowring, Arundel andandandand Co., Savile Row. It was a sincere shirt,
and it was a sincere necktie. If only he could afford a new blazer, with
rich belly-cut lapels that didn’t shine…Ah well, hey ho—soon enough! He
stopped by the edge of the desk and picked up a City Light from a stack
of early editions left there for the use of the staff. SEEK “FOXY”
BRUNETTE MYSTERY GIRL. Another page 1 story by Peter Fallow. The rest of
the print swam amid the foggy eye trash in front of his face. But he
continued to stare at it, so as to give them all a chance to drink in
the presence of…Peter Fallow…Take a look, you poor drudges, humped over
your word processors, clattering away and nattering away and grousing
about your “one hundred big ones.” All at once he felt so grand, he
thought about what a superior gesture it would be to walk over to poor
Goldman and give him his hundred dollars. Well, he’d put that in the
back of his mind.</p>
<p>When he reached his cubicle, there were already six or seven message
slips on his desk. He leafed through them, half expecting that one might
be from a movie producer.</p>
<p>Sir Gerald Steiner, formerly the Dead Mouse, was heading his way with
his coat off and a pair of bright red felt suspenders over his striped
shirt and a smile on his face, a charming smile, an ingratiating smile,
instead of that malevolent wolf-eyed look of a few weeks back. The
canteen of vodka was still hidden in the pocket of the raincoat, which
still hung on the plastic coatrack in the corner. He could probably take
it out and knock back a fiery jolt right in front of the Mouse, and what
would come of it? Nothing but a knowing would-be-comradely Mouse smile,
if he knew his Mouse.</p>
<p>“Peter!” said Steiner. Peter; no more school proctor’s Fallow. “Want
to see something to brighten your day?”</p>
<p>Steiner slapped the photograph down on Fallow’s desk. It showed
Sherman McCoy with a terrific scowl on his face giving a backhand swat
to the face of a tall woman who was holding some sort of wand, which on
close inspection turned out to be a microphone. With his other hand he
clutched the hand of a little girl in a school uniform. The little girl
looked into the camera in a quizzical daze. In the background was the
marquee of an apartment house and a doorman.</p>
<p>Steiner was chuckling. “The woman—dreadful woman, by the way, from
some radio station—rings up five times an hour. Says she’s going to have
McCoy arrested for assault. She wants the picture. She’ll have the
picture, all right. It’s on page 1 of the next edition.”</p>
<p>Fallow picked up the picture and studied it. “Hmmm. Pretty little
girl. Must be difficult having a father who keeps hitting minorities,
black boys, women. Have you ever noticed the way the Yanks refer to
women as a minority?”</p>
<p>“The poor mother tongue,” said Steiner.</p>
<p>“Marvelous picture,” said Fallow, quite sincerely. “Who took it?”</p>
<p>“Silverstein. That chap does have sand. He does, indeed.”</p>
<p>“Silverstein’s on the death watch?” asked Fallow.</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Steiner. “He loves that sort of thing. You know,
Peter”—Peter—“I have respect, perhaps an inverted respect, but a true
respect, for chaps like Silverstein. They’re the farmers of journalism.
They love the good rich soil itself, for itself, not for the pay—they
like to plunge their hands into the dirt.” Steiner paused, puzzled. He
was always nonplussed by his own plays on words.</p>
<p>Oh, how Sir Gerald, baby boy of Old Steiner, would love to be able to
wallow in that filth with such Dionysian abandon!—like a chap with sand!
His eyes brimmed with a warm emotion: love, perhaps, or nostalgia for
the mud.</p>
<p>“The Laughing Vandals,” said Steiner, smiling broadly and shaking his
head, apropos of the renowned exploits of the sandy photographer. That
in turn led him to a broader source of satisfaction.</p>
<p>“I want to tell you something, Peter. I don’t know whether you fully
appreciate it or not, but you’ve broken a very important story with this
Lamb and McCoy business. Oh, it’s sensational, but it’s much more than
that. It’s a morality play. Think of that for a moment. A morality play.
You mentioned minorities. I realize you were joking, but we’re already
hearing from these minorities, from these black organizations and
whatnot, the very organizations that have been spreading rumors that we
are racist and all the usual sort of rubbish, and now they’re
congratulating us and looking to us as a sort of…beacon. That’s quite a
turnabout in a short time. These Third World Anti-Defamation League
people, the very people who were so incensed over the Laughing Vandals,
they’ve just sent me the most glowing testimonial. We’re the bloody
standard-bearers of liberalism and civil rights now! They think you’re a
genius, by the way. This man, Reverend Bacon, as they call him, seems to
run it. He’d give you the Nobel Prize, if it was up to him. I should
have Brian show you the letter.”</p>
<p>Fallow said nothing. The idiots might be a bit more subtle about
it.</p>
<p>“What I’m trying to get across, Peter, is that this is a very
significant step in the progress of the newspaper. Our readers don’t
care about respectability one way or the other. But the advertisers do.
I’ve already set Brian to work on seeing if perhaps we can’t get some of
these black groups to render their new opinion of The City Light formal
in some fashion, through citations or awards or—I don’t know, but Brian
will know how to go about it. I hope you’ll be able to take time out to
take part in whatever he comes up with. But we’ll see how that works
out.”</p>
<p>“Oh, absolutely,” said Fallow. “Of course. I know how strongly these
people feel. Did you know that the judge who refused to increase McCoy’s
bond yesterday has received death threats?”</p>
<p>“Death threats! You’re not serious.” The Mouse twitched with the
horrible excitement of it.</p>
<p>“It’s true. And he’s taking it quite seriously, too.”</p>
<p>“Great God,” said Steiner. “This is an amazing country.”</p>
<p>Fallow perceived this as a fortunate moment in which to suggest to
Sir Gerald a significant step of another sort: a thousand-dollar
advance, which in turn might suggest to the eminent Mouse a rise in pay
as well.</p>
<p>And he was correct on both counts. As soon as the new blazer was
ready, he was going to burn this one; with pleasure.</p>
<p>Scarcely a minute after Steiner had left, Fallow’s telephone rang. It
was Albert Vogel.</p>
<p>“Hey, Pete! Howaya? Things are poppin’, things are poppin’, things
are poppin’. Pete, you got to do me a favor. You got to give me McCoy’s
telephone number. It’s unlisted.”</p>
<p>Without knowing precisely why, Fallow found this a startling notion.
“Why would you want his telephone number, Al?”</p>
<p>“Well, the thing is, Pete, I’ve been retained by Annie Lamb, who
wants to file a civil suit in behalf of her son. Two suits, actually:
one against the hospital, for gross negligence, and one against
McCoy.”</p>
<p>“And you want his home telephone number? What for?”</p>
<p>“What for? We might have to negotiate.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see why you don’t call his barrister.”</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ, Pete.” Vogel’s voice turned angry. “I didn’t call you
up for legal advice. All I want’s a fucking telephone number. You got
his number or not?”</p>
<p>Fallow’s better judgment told him to say no. But his vanity wouldn’t
allow him to tell Vogel that I, Fallow, proprietor of the McCoy case,
had been unable to procure the McCoy telephone number.</p>
<p>“All right, Al. I propose a barter. You give me the particulars of
the civil suits and a one-day head start with the story, and I’ll give
you the telephone number.”</p>
<p>“Look, Pete, I wanna call a press conference about the suits. All I’m
asking you for is a lousy telephone number.”</p>
<p>“You can still call a press conference. You’ll get a larger audience
after I write the story.”</p>
<p>A pause. “Okay, Pete.” Vogel chuckled, but not very heartily. “I
think I created a monster when I put you onto Henry Lamb. Who do you
think you are, Lincoln Steffens?”</p>
<p>“Lincoln who?”</p>
<p>“Never mind. It wouldn’t interest you. Okay, you can have the fucking
story. Aren’t you getting tired of all these exclusives? So gimme the
number.”</p>
<p>And so he did.</p>
<p>When one got right down to it, what difference would it make whether
he had the number or not?</p>
