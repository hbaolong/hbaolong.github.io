<h4 id="into-the-solar-plexus">31. Into the Solar Plexus</h4>
<p>It was a sunny day this time, a balmy day in June. The air was so
light it seemed pure and refreshing, even here in the Bronx. A perfect
day, in short; Sherman took it badly. He took it personally. How very
heartless! How could Nature, Fate—God—contrive such a sublime production
for his hour of misery? Heartlessness on all sides. A spasm of fear
reached down to the very bottom of his descending colon.</p>
<p>He was in the back seat of a Buick with Killian. Ed Quigley was in
the front seat, next to the chauffeur, who had dark skin, thick straight
black hair, and fine, exquisite, almost pretty features. An Asian? They
came down the ramp from the expressway right past the bowl of Yankee
Stadium, and a big sign said, TONIGHT 7 PM YANKEES VS. KANSAS CITY. How
very heartless! Tens of thousands of people would come to this place
tonight anyway—to drink beer and watch a white ball hop and pop around
for two hours—and he would be back in there, in a darkness he couldn’t
imagine. And it would begin. The poor fools! They didn’t know what the
real thing was like! Tens of thousands of them in Yankee Stadium,
watching a game, a mere charade of war, while he was in a war. And it
would begin…the elemental physical violence…</p>
<p>Now the Buick was going up the long hill, up 161st Street. They would
be there in no time.</p>
<p>“It’s not the same courthouse,” said Killian. “It’s the building up
on the top of the hill, on the right.”</p>
<p>Sherman could see an immense limestone structure. It looked quite
majestic sitting up there on the crest of the Grand Concourse in the
sunlight of a perfect day; majestic and stupendously heavy.</p>
<p>Sherman could see the driver’s eyes seeking him out in the rearview
mirror, and then they locked in an embarrassing contact and jumped away.
Quigley, up front next to the driver, was wearing a tie and a jacket,
but just barely. The jacket, a curious Meat Gone High teal-green tweed,
was riding up away from the pitted skin of his neck. He looked like the
kind of fidgety Hard Case who is spoiling for an opportunity to peel off
the jacket and tie and start fighting and cultivating hematomas or,
better still, intimidate some funk-ridden weakling who isn’t ready to
meet the challenge to fight.</p>
<p>As the car ascended the hill, Sherman could see a crowd in the street
near the top, out in front of the limestone building. Cars were
squeezing over in order to get by.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” he said.</p>
<p>“Looks like a demonstration,” said Quigley.</p>
<p>Killian said, “Well, at least they aren’t in front of your apartment
house this time.”</p>
<p>“A de-mon-strrra-tion? Hahahaha,” said the chauffeur. He had a
singsong accent and a polite and thoroughly nervous laugh. “What it is
about? Hahahaha.”</p>
<p>“It’s about us,” said Quigley in his dead voice.</p>
<p>The chauffeur looked at Quigley. “About yooouuu? Hahahaha.”</p>
<p>“You know the gentleman who hired this car? Mr. McCoy?” Quigley
motioned with his head toward the back seat.</p>
<p>In the mirror the chauffeur’s eyes searched and locked on again.
“Hahahaha.” Then he became quiet.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” said Quigley. “It’s always safer in the middle of a
riot than out on the edge. That’s a well-known fact.”</p>
<p>The chauffeur looked at Quigley again and said, “Hahahaha.” Then he
became very quiet, no doubt trying to figure out which to be more afraid
of, the demonstrators he was approaching on the street or the Hard Case
who was inside and merely inches away from his as yet unwrung neck. Then
he sought out Sherman again with his eyes and locked on and then jumped
inside the cavity and flailed away, bug-eyed with panic.</p>
<p>“Nothing’s gonna happen,” Killian said to Sherman. “There’ll be cops
up there. They’ll be ready for ’em. It’s the same bunch every time,
Bacon and that crowd. Do you think the people of the Bronx give a damn
one way or the other? Don’t flatter yourself. This is the same bunch,
doing their same weird number. It’s a show. Just keep your mouth shut
and look straight ahead. This time we have a surprise for them.”</p>
<p>As the car neared Walton Avenue, Sherman could see the crowd out in
the street. They were all around the base of the huge limestone building
at the top of the hill. He could hear a voice coming over a microphone.
People were answering the voice with a chant. Whoever was screaming over
the microphone seemed to be up on the terrace of the stairway on the
161st Street side. There were camera crews with their equipment sticking
up out of the sea of faces.</p>
<p>The driver said, “You waaaant me to stop? Hahahahaha.”</p>
<p>“Just keep moving,” said Quigley. “I’ll tell you when to stop.”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha.”</p>
<p>Killian said to Sherman, “We’re going in through the side.” Then to
the driver: “Take the next right!”</p>
<p>“All the peeeoooople! Hahahaha.”</p>
<p>“Just take the next right,” said Quigley, “and don’t worry about
it.”</p>
<p>Killian said to Sherman, “Duck down. Tie your shoe or something.”</p>
<p>The car turned onto the street that ran along the lower edge of the
great limestone building. But Sherman sat up straight in his seat. It no
longer mattered. When would it begin? He could see blue-and-orange vans
with wire mesh over their windows. The crowd had spilled off the
sidewalk. They were looking up toward the 161st Street side. The voice
harangued them, and the chants arose from the mob on the stairs.</p>
<p>“Hook a left,” said Killian. “Right in there. See that red cone?
That’s it.”</p>
<p>The car was heading in at a ninety-degree angle toward the curbing at
the base of the building. Some sort of policeman was out there lifting
up a Day-Glo rubber cone from the middle of a parking place. Quigley was
holding a card up in the windshield with his left hand, apparently for
the benefit of the policeman. There were four or five other policemen on
the sidewalk. They wore short-sleeved white shirts and had tremendous
revolvers on their hips.</p>
<p>“When I open the door,” said Killian, “you get in between me and Ed
and make tracks.”</p>
<p>The door opened, and they scrambled out. Quigley was on Sherman’s
right; Killian on his left. People on the sidewalk stared at them but
didn’t seem to know who they were. Three of the policemen in white
shirts sidled between the crowd and Sherman, Killian, and Quigley.
Killian took hold of Sherman’s elbow and steered him toward a door.
Quigley was carrying a heavy case. A policeman in a white shirt stood in
the doorway, then stepped aside to let them through into a lobby lit by
dim fluorescent bulbs. On the right was a doorway to what looked like a
utility room. Sherman could make out the black and gray hulks of people
slumped on benches.</p>
<p>“They did us a favor by having their demonstration on the steps,”
said Killian. His voice was high-pitched and tense. Two officers led
them toward an elevator, which another officer was holding open for
them.</p>
<p>They entered the elevator, and the officer stepped inside with them.
The officer pressed the button for the ninth floor, and they began their
ascent.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Brucie,” Killian said to the officer.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. You got Bernie to thank, though.” Killian looked at
Sherman, as if to say, “What did I tell you?”</p>
<p>On the ninth floor, outside a room marked Part 60, there was a noisy
crowd in the corridor. A line of court officers was holding them
back.</p>
<p>Yo!…There he is!</p>
<p>Sherman looked straight ahead. When does it begin? A man jumped out
in front of him—a white man, tall, with blond hair swept back from a
sharp widow’s peak. He wore a navy blazer and a navy tie, and a shirt
with a striped front and a stiff white collar. It was the reporter,
Fallow. Sherman had last seen him when he was about to enter Central
Booking…that place…</p>
<p>“Mr. McCoy!!” That voice.</p>
<p>With Killian on one side and Quigley on the other and the court
officer, Brucie, leading the way, they were like a flying wedge. They
brushed the Englishman aside and went through a door. They were in the
courtroom. A crowd of people to Sherman’s left…in the spectator
seats…Black faces…some white faces…In the foreground was a tall black
man with a gold earring in one lobe. He rose up from his seat in a
crouch and pointed a long, thin arm at Sherman and said in a loud
guttural whisper: “That’s him!” Then in a louder voice: “Jail! No
bail!”</p>
<p>The deep voice of a woman: “Lock him up!”</p>
<p>Yegggh!…That’s the one!…Look at him!…Jail! No bail!</p>
<p>Now? Not yet. Killian held his elbow and whispered in his ear,
“Ignore it!”</p>
<p>A falsetto croon: “Sherrrr-maannnn…Sherrrr-maannnn.”</p>
<p>“SHUT UP! SIT DOWN!”</p>
<p>It was the loudest voice Sherman had ever heard. At first he thought
it was directed at himself. He felt terribly guilty, even though he
hadn’t uttered a sound.</p>
<p>“ANY MORE OUTBURSTS—I CLEAR THE COURT! DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?”</p>
<p>Up at the judge’s bench, beneath the inscription IN GOD WE TRUST, a
thin bald hawk-nosed man in black robes stood with his fists on top of
his desk and his arms straight, as if he were a runner about to spring
from the starting position. Sherman could see the white beneath the
irises as the judge’s blazing eyes swept the crowd before him. The
demonstrators grumbled but grew still.</p>
<p>The judge, Myron Kovitsky, continued to stare at them with his
furious gaze.</p>
<p>“In this courtroom you speak when the court asks you to speak. You
pass judgment on your fellow man when you are selected for a jury and
the court asks you to pass judgment. You stand up and render your obiter
dicta when the court asks you to stand up and render your obiter dicta.
Until then—YOU SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN! AND I…AM THE COURT! DO I MAKE
MYSELF CLEAR? Is there anyone who disputes what I have just said and
holds this court in such contempt that he would like to spend some time
as a guest of the state of New York contemplating what I have just said?
DO—I—MAKE—MYSELF—CLEAR?”</p>
<p>His eyes panned the crowd from left to right and right to left and
left to right again.</p>
<p>“All right. Now that you understand that, perhaps you can observe
these proceedings as responsible members of the community. So long as
you do so, you are welcome in this courtroom. And the moment you
don’t—you’ll wish you hadda stood in bed! Do—I—make—myself—clear?”</p>
<p>His voice rose again so suddenly and to such an intensity the crowd
seemed to recoil, startled at the thought that the wrath of this furious
little man might descend upon them again.</p>
<p>Kovitsky sat down and spread his arms. His robes billowed out like
wings. He lowered his head. The whites still showed beneath his irises.
The room was now still. Sherman, Killian, and Quigley stood near the
fence—the bar—that separated the spectators’ section from the court
proper. Kovitsky’s eyes settled on Sherman and Killian. He appeared to
be angry at them, too. He breathed what seemed to be a sigh of
disgust.</p>
<p>Then he turned to the clerk of the court, who sat at a large
conference table to one side. Sherman followed Kovitsky’s gaze, and
there, standing beside the table, he saw the assistant district
attorney, Kramer.</p>
<p>Kovitsky said to the clerk, “Call the case.”</p>
<p>The clerk called out: “Indictment number 4-7-2-6, the People versus
Sherman McCoy. Who is representing Mr. McCoy?”</p>
<p>Killian stepped up to the bar and said, “I am.”</p>
<p>The clerk said, “Please give your appearance.”</p>
<p>“Thomas Killian, 86 Reade Street.”</p>
<p>Kovitsky said, “Mr. Kramer, you have a motion to make at this
time?”</p>
<p>This man, Kramer, took a few steps toward the bench. He walked like a
football player. He stopped, threw his head back, tensed his neck, for
some reason, and said, “Your Honor, the defendant, Mr. McCoy, is
currently free on ten thousand dollars’ bail, an insignificant sum for a
person with his particular advantages and resources in the financial
community.”</p>
<p>Yegggh!…Jail! No bail!…Make him pay!</p>
<p>Kovitsky, his head down low, glowered. The voices died down to a
rumble.</p>
<p>“As Your Honor knows,” Kramer continued, “the grand jury has now
brought in an indictment against the defendant on serious charges:
reckless endangerment, leaving the scene of an accident, and failure to
report an accident. Now, Your Honor, inasmuch as the grand jury has
already found sufficient evidence of the defendant’s abandonment of his
responsibilities to indict him, the People feel there also exists the
substantial possibility that the defendant might ignore and abandon his
bond, given the small amount of that bond.”</p>
<p>Yeah…That’s right…Unh-hunh…</p>
<p>“So, Your Honor,” said Kramer, “the People feel it is incumbent upon
the court to send a clear signal not only to the defendant but to the
community that what is at issue here is in fact regarded with the utmost
seriousness. At the heart of this case, Your Honor, is a young man, an
exemplary young man, Mr. Henry Lamb, who has become a symbol to the
people of the Bronx of both the hopes they have for their sons and
daughters and the callous and deadly obstacles that they face. Your
Honor is already aware of the passion with which the community is
following every step of this case. Were this courtroom larger, the
people of this community would be here at this moment by the hundreds,
possibly the thousands, just as they are even now in the corridors and
on the streets outside.”</p>
<p>Right on!…Jail! No bail!…You tell him!</p>
<p>KAPOW!</p>
<p>Kovitsky brought his gavel down with a tremendous explosion.</p>
<p>“QUIET!”</p>
<p>The rumble of the crowd sank back to a low boil.</p>
<p>His head down low, his irises floating on a sea of white, Kovitsky
said, “Get to the point, Mr. Kramer. This isn’t a pep rally. It’s a
hearing in a court of law.”</p>
<p>Kramer knew he was staring at all the usual signs. The irises were
floating on that foaming sea. The head was down. The beak was out. It
wasn’t going to take much more to set Kovitsky off. On the other hand,
he thought, I can’t back down. Can’t give in. Kovitsky’s attitude so
far—even though it was nothing but standard Kovitsky, the usual yelling,
the usual belligerent insistence on his authority—Kovitsky’s attitude so
far established him as an adversary of the demonstrators. The Office of
the District Attorney of Bronx County was their friend. Abe Weiss was
their friend. Larry Kramer was their friend. The People were…truly the
People. That was what he was here for. He would just have to take his
chance with Kovitsky—with those furious Masada eyes that now bore down
on him.</p>
<p>His own voice sounded funny to him as he said, “I’m mindful of that,
Your Honor, but I must also be mindful of the importance of this case to
the People, to all the Henry Lambs, present and future, in this county
and in this city—”</p>
<p>Tell him, bro!…Right on!…That’s right!</p>
<p>Kramer hastened to continue, in an even louder voice, before Kovitsky
detonated: “—and therefore the People petition the court to increase the
defendant to a significant and credible amount—to one million dollars—in
order to—”</p>
<p>Jail! No bail!…Jail! No bail!…Jail! No bail! The demonstrators
erupted into a chant.</p>
<p>That’s right!…Million dollars!…Yaggghh!…The voice of the crowd rose
in a cheer laced with exultant laughter and then crested with a chant:
Jail! No bail!…Jail! No bail!…Jail! No bail!…Jail! No bail!</p>
<p>Kovitsky’s gavel rose a full foot above his head and Kramer flinched
inwardly before it hit.</p>
<p>KAPOW!</p>
<p>Kovitsky gave Kramer a furious glance, then leaned forward and
fastened upon the crowd.</p>
<p>“ORDER IN THE COURT!…SHUDDUP!…DO YOU DOUBT MY WORD?” His irises
surfed this way and that on the furious boiling sea.</p>
<p>The chanting stopped, and the cries lowered to a rumble. But little
riffs of laughter indicated they were just waiting for the next
opening.</p>
<p>“THE COURT OFFICERS WILL—”</p>
<p>“Your Honor! Your Honor!” It was McCoy’s lawyer, Killian.</p>
<p>“What is it, Mr. Killian?”</p>
<p>The interruption threw the crowd off stride. They quieted down.</p>
<p>“Your Honor, may I approach the bench?”</p>
<p>“All right, Mr. Killian.” Kovitsky beckoned him forward.
“Mr. Kramer?” Kramer headed for the bench also.</p>
<p>Now he was standing next to Killian, Killian in his fancy clothes,
before the bench, beneath the glowering brow of Judge Kovitsky.</p>
<p>“Okay, Mr. Killian,” said Kovitsky, “what’s up?”</p>
<p>“Judge,” said Killian, “if I’m not mistaken, you’re the supervising
judge of the grand jury in this case?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct,” he said to Killian, but then he turned his
attention to Kramer. “You hard of hearing Mr. Kramer?”</p>
<p>Kramer said nothing. He didn’t have to answer a question like
that.</p>
<p>“You intoxicated by the sound of this bunch”—Kovitsky nodded toward
the spectators—“cheering you on?”</p>
<p>“No, Judge, but there’s no way this case can be treated like an
ordinary case.”</p>
<p>“In this courtroom, Mr. Kramer, it’s gonna be treated any fucking way
I say it’s gonna be treated. Do I make myself clear?”</p>
<p>“You always make yourself clear, Judge.”</p>
<p>Kovitsky eyed him, apparently trying to decide if there was any
insolence in the remark. “All right, then you know that if you pull any
more of that arrant bullshit in this courtroom, you’re gonna wish you
never laid eyes on Mike Kovitsky!”</p>
<p>He couldn’t just take this, with Killian standing right there, and so
he said, “Look, Judge, I have every right—”</p>
<p>Kovitsky broke in: “Every right to do what? Run Abe Weiss’s
reelection campaign for him in my courtroom? Bullshit, Mr. Kramer! Tell
him to hire a hall, call a press conference. Tell him to go on a talk
show, f’r Chrissake.”</p>
<p>Kramer was so angry he couldn’t speak. His face was flaming red.
Between his teeth he said, “Is that all, Judge?” Without waiting for an
answer, he turned on his heels and started away.</p>
<p>“Mr. Kramer!”</p>
<p>He stopped and turned around. Glowering, Kovitsky motioned him back
to the bench. “Mr. Killian has a question, I believe. Or do you want me
to listen to him by myself?”</p>
<p>Kramer just clenched his teeth and stared.</p>
<p>“All right, Mr. Killian, go ahead.”</p>
<p>Killian said, “Judge, I am in possession of important evidence that
bears not only upon Mr. Kramer’s application concerning bail but upon
the validity of the indictment itself.”</p>
<p>“What kind of evidence?”</p>
<p>“I have tapes of conversations between my client and a principal in
this case that make it appear highly likely that tainted testimony was
presented to the grand jury.”</p>
<p>What the hell was this? Kramer broke in: “Judge, this is nonsense. We
have a valid indictment from the grand jury. If Mr. Killian has any
quarrel—”</p>
<p>“Just hold it, Mr. Kramer,” said Kovitsky.</p>
<p>“—if he has any quarrel with the grand-jury proceedings, he has the
customary avenues—”</p>
<p>“Just hold it. Mr. Killian says he has some evidence—”</p>
<p>“Evidence! This isn’t an evidentiary hearing, Judge! He can’t come
walking in here and dispute the grand-jury process, ex post facto! And
you can’t—”</p>
<p>“MR. KRAMER!”</p>
<p>The sound of Kovitsky raising his voice sent a growl through the
demonstrators, who were all at once rumbling again.</p>
<p>Eyes surfing on the turbulent sea: “Mr. Kramer, you know your
problem? You don’t fucking listen, do you! You can’t fucking hear!”</p>
<p>“Judge—”</p>
<p>“SHUDDUP! The court is gonna listen to Mr. Killian’s evidence.”</p>
<p>“Judge—”</p>
<p>“We’re gonna do this in camera.”</p>
<p>“In camera? Why?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Killian says he has some tapes. First we’re gonna listen to ’em
in camera.”</p>
<p>“Look, Judge—”</p>
<p>“You don’t wanna go in camera, Mr. Kramer? You afraid you gonna miss
your audience?”</p>
<p>Seething, Kramer looked down and shook his head.</p>
<p>Sherman was stranded back at the fence, the bar. Quigley was
somewhere behind him, holding the heavy case. But mainly…they were
behind him. When would it begin? He kept his eyes fixed on the three
figures at the judge’s bench. He didn’t dare let his eyes wander. Then
the voices began. They came from behind him in menacing singsongs.</p>
<p>“Your last mile, McCoy!”</p>
<p>“Last supper.”</p>
<p>Then a soft falsetto: “Last breath.”</p>
<p>Somewhere, on either side, were court officers. They were doing
nothing to stop it. They’re as frightened as I am!</p>
<p>The same falsetto: “Yo, Sherman, why you squirmin’?”</p>
<p>Squirming. Evidently the others liked that. They began piping up in
falsetto, too.</p>
<p>“Sherrr-maaannnn…”</p>
<p>“Squirmin’ Sherman!”</p>
<p>Sniggers and laughter.</p>
<p>Sherman stared at the bench, wherein seemed to reside his only hope.
As if in answer to his supplication, the judge now looked toward him and
said, “Mr. McCoy, would you step up here a minute?”</p>
<p>A rumble and a chorus of falsettos as he started walking. As he drew
near the bench, he heard the assistant district attorney, Kramer, say,
“I don’t understand, Judge. What purpose is served by the presence of
the defendant?”</p>
<p>The judge said, “It’s his motion and his evidence. Besides, I don’t
want him rattling around out here. That okay with you, Mr. Kramer?”</p>
<p>Kramer said nothing. He glared at the judge and then at Sherman.</p>
<p>The judge said, “Mr. McCoy, you’re gonna come with me and Mr. Killian
and Mr. Kramer into my chambers.”</p>
<p>Then he gave three loud raps with his gavel and said to the room,
“The court will now convene with the attorney for the People and the
counsel for the defense in camera. In my absence the proper decorum WILL
BE MAINTAINED in this room. Do I make myself clear?”</p>
<p>The rumble of the demonstrators rose to a low angry boil, but
Kovitsky chose to ignore it and got up and descended the stairs of the
dais. The clerk got up from his table to join him. Killian gave Sherman
a wink, then headed back toward the spectator section. The judge, the
clerk, the judge’s law secretary, and Kramer headed toward a door in the
paneled wall to one side of the dais. Killian returned, carrying the
heavy case. He paused and motioned for Sherman to follow Kovitsky. The
court officer, with a huge tube of fat rolling over his gun belt,
brought up the rear.</p>
<p>The door led into a room that belied everything that the courtroom
itself and the swell term chambers had suggested to Sherman. The
“chambers” were, in fact, a single room, a single very sad room. It was
small, dirty, bare, run-down, painted Good Enough for Government Work
cream, except that the paint was missing in splotches here and there and
peeling off in miserable curls in other places. The only generous notes
were the extraordinarily high ceiling and a window eight or nine feet
high that flooded the room with light. The judge sat down at a beat-up
metal desk. The clerk sat at another one. Kramer, Killian, and Sherman
sat in some heavy and ancient round-backed wooden chairs, the sort known
as banker’s chairs. Kovitsky’s law secretary and the fat court officer
stood up against the wall. A tall man came in carrying the portable
stenotype machine that court stenographers use. How odd!—the man was so
well dressed. He wore a lovat tweed jacket, a white button-down shirt,
as flawless as Rawlie’s, an ancient madder necktie, black flannel
trousers, and half-brogue shoes. He looked like a Yale professor with an
independent income and tenure.</p>
<p>“Mr. Sullivan,” said Kovitsky, “you better bring your chair in here,
too.”</p>
<p>Mr. Sullivan went out, then returned with a small wooden chair, sat
down, fiddled with his machine, looked at Kovitsky, and nodded.</p>
<p>Then Kovitsky said, “Now, Mr. Killian, you state that you are in
possession of information having a material and substantial bearing on
the grand-jury proceedings in this case.”</p>
<p>“That’s correct, Judge,” said Killian.</p>
<p>“All right,” said Kovitsky. “I want to hear what you have to say, but
I must warn you, this motion better not be frivolous.”</p>
<p>“It’s not frivolous, Judge.”</p>
<p>“Because if it is, I’m gonna take a very dim view of it, as dim a
view as I’ve ever taken of anything in my years on the bench, and that
would be very dim, indeed. Do I make myself clear?”</p>
<p>“You certainly do, Judge.”</p>
<p>“All right. Now, you’re prepared to submit your information at this
time?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“Then go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Three days ago, Judge, I received a telephone call from Maria
Ruskin, the widow of Mr. Arthur Ruskin, asking if she could talk to
Mr. McCoy here. According to my best information—and according to news
reports—Mrs. Ruskin has testified before the grand jury in the
case.”</p>
<p>Kovitsky said to Kramer, “Is that correct?”</p>
<p>Kramer said, “She gave testimony yesterday.”</p>
<p>The judge said to Killian, “All right, go ahead.”</p>
<p>“So I set up a meeting between Mrs. Ruskin and Mr. McCoy, and at my
urging Mr. McCoy wore a concealed recording device to this meeting in
order to have a verifiable record of that conversation. The meeting was
in an apartment on East Seventy-seventh Street that Mrs. Ruskin
apparently keeps for…uh, private meetings…and a taped recording of that
meeting was obtained. I have that tape with me, and I think the court
should be aware of what’s on that tape.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute, Judge,” said Kramer. “Is he saying that his client
went to see Mrs. Ruskin wired?”</p>
<p>“I take it that’s the case,” said the judge. “Is that right,
Mr. Killian?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct, Judge,” said Killian.</p>
<p>“Well, I want to register an objection, Judge,” said Kramer, “and I
would like for the record to so state. This isn’t the time to consider
this motion, and besides that, there’s no way of checking on the
authenticity of this tape Mr. Killian purports to have.”</p>
<p>“First we’re gonna listen to the tape, Mr. Kramer, and see what’s on
it. We’ll see if it warrants further consideration, prima facie, and
then we’ll worry about the other questions. That meet with your
approval?”</p>
<p>“No, Judge, I don’t see how you can—”</p>
<p>The judge, testily: “Play the tape, Counselor.”</p>
<p>Killian reached into the case and took out the big tape machine and
placed it on Kovitsky’s desk. Then he inserted a cassette. The cassette
was exceedingly small. Somehow this secret miniature cartridge seemed as
devious and sordid as the enterprise itself.</p>
<p>“How many voices are on this tape?” asked Kovitsky.</p>
<p>“Just two, Judge,” said Killian. “Mr. McCoy’s and Mrs. Ruskin’s.”</p>
<p>“So it’ll be clear enough to Mr. Sullivan what we’re hearing?”</p>
<p>“It should be,” said Killian. “No, I’m sorry, Judge, I forgot. At the
beginning of the tape you’re gonna hear Mr. McCoy talking to the driver
of the car that took him to the building where he met Mrs. Ruskin. And
at the end you’ll hear him talking to the driver again.”</p>
<p>“Who is this driver?”</p>
<p>“He’s a driver for the car service that Mr. McCoy hired. I didn’t
want to edit the tape in any way.”</p>
<p>“Unh-hunh. Well, go ahead and play it.”</p>
<p>Killian turned on the machine, and all you could hear at first was
background noise, a low steamy rush of sound with occasional traffic
noises, including the braying horn of a fire engine. Then a half-mumbled
exchange with the driver. It was all so devious, wasn’t it? A wave of
shame rolled over him. They would play it to the end! The stenographer
would record it all, every last sniveling word as he tried to dance away
from Maria and deny the obvious, which was that he was a deceitful
bastard who had come to her apartment wired up. How much of it would
come through in the words alone? Enough; he was vile.</p>
<p>Now the muffled deceitful tape recorder broadcast the sound of the
buzzer in the door of the town house, the click-click-click of the
electric lock and—or was it his imagination?—the groan of the stairs as
he trudged up. Then a door opening…and Maria’s gay, unsuspecting voice:
“Boo!…Scare yuh?” And the perfidious actor’s casual response in a voice
he scarcely recognized: “Not really. Lately I’ve been scared by
experts.” He cut a glance this way and that. The other men in the room
had their heads down, staring at the floor or at the machine on the
judge’s desk. Then he caught the fat court officer looking straight at
him. What must he be thinking? And what about the others, with their
eyes averted? But of course! They didn’t have to look at him, because
they were already deep inside the cavity, rooting about as they pleased,
all straining to hear the words of his deceitful bad acting. The long
fingers of the stenographer danced about on his delicate little machine.
Sherman felt a paralyzing sadness. So heavy…couldn’t move. In this sad
moldering little room were seven other men, seven other organisms,
hundreds of pounds of tissue and bone, breathing, pumping blood, burning
calories, processing nutrients, filtering out contaminants and toxins,
transmitting neural impulses, seven warm grisly unpleasant animals
rooting about, for pay, in the entirely public cavity he used to think
of as his soul.</p>
<p>Kramer was dying to look at McCoy, but decided to be cool and
professional. What does a rat look like when he’s listening to himself
being a rat in a room full of people who know he’s a rat—going wired to
see his girlfriend? Unconsciously, but profoundly, Kramer was relieved.
Sherman McCoy, this Wasp, this Wall Street aristocrat, this socialite,
this Yale man, was as much a rat as any of the drug dealers he had wired
up to go rat out their species. No, McCoy was more of a rat. One doper
didn’t expect much from another. But in these upper reaches, upon these
pinnacles of propriety and moralism, up in this stratosphere ruled by
the pale thin-lipped Wasps, honor, presumably, was not a word to be
trifled with. Yet backed to the wall, they turned rat just as quickly as
any lowlife. This was a relief, because he had been troubled by what
Bernie Fitzgibbon had said. Suppose the case had not, in fact, been
investigated carefully enough? Maria Ruskin had corroborated Roland’s
story before the grand jury, but in his heart he knew he had pushed her
pretty hard. He had put her in a small tight box so fast she might
have—</p>
<p>He preferred not to finish the thought.</p>
<p>The knowledge that McCoy was at bottom nothing but a rat with a
better résumé put his mind at rest. McCoy was caught in this particular
mess because it was his natural milieu, the filthy nest of his defective
character.</p>
<p>Having reassured himself of the rightness of his cause, Kramer
treated himself to some positive resentment of this big pseudoaristocrat
who now sat only a few feet from him filling up the room with his rat
aroma. As he listened to the two voices on the tape, the aristocratic
honk of McCoy, the Southern Girl drawl of Maria Ruskin, it didn’t take
too much imagination to figure out what was going on. The pauses, the
breathing, the rustling about—McCoy, the rat, had taken this gorgeous
foxy creature into his arms…And this apartment on East Seventy-seventh
Street where they were meeting—these people on the Upper East Side had
apartments just for their pleasures!—while he still searched his brain
(and his pockets) for some place to accommodate the yearnings of Miss
Shelly Thomas. The Beauty and the Rat talked on…. There was a pause
while she left the room to fix him a drink and a scraping noise as he
apparently touched his hidden microphone. The Rat. The voices resumed,
and then she said, “There’s a lotta people’d like to hear this
conversation.”</p>
<p>Not even Kovitsky could resist looking up and around the room at that
one, but Kramer refused to oblige him with a smile.</p>
<p>Maria Ruskin’s voice droned on. Now she was whining about her
marriage. Where the hell was this tape supposed to be leading? The
woman’s complaints were boring. She had married an old man. What the
hell did she expect? Idly he wondered—he could see her, as if she were
right here in the room. The languorous way she crossed her legs, the
little smile, the way she looked at you sometimes—</p>
<p>All at once he was jerked alert: “A man from the Bronx District
Attorney’s Office came around to see me today, with two detectives.”
Then: “A pompous little bastard.”</p>
<p>Whuh—he was stunned. A scalding tide rose up in his neck and face.
Somehow it was the little that wounded him most. Such a contemptuous
dismissal—and him with his mighty sternocleidomastoids—he lifted his
eyes to search out the faces of the others, ready to laugh defensively
if anyone else happened to look up and smile at such outrageousness. But
no one looked up, least of all McCoy, whom he would have gladly
throttled.</p>
<p>“He kept throwing his head back and doing something weird with his
neck, like this, and looking at me through these little slits for eyes.
What a creep.”</p>
<p>His face was now scarlet, aflame, boiling with anger and, worse than
anger, dismay. Someone in the room made a sound that might be a cough
and might be a laugh. He didn’t have enough heart to investigate. Bitch!
said his mind, consciously. But his nervous system said, Wanton
destroyer of my fondest hopes! In this little room full of people he was
suffering the pangs of men whose egos lose their virginity—as happens
when they overhear for the first time a beautiful woman’s undiluted,
full-strength opinion of their masculine selves.</p>
<p>What came next was worse.</p>
<p>“He made it real simple, Sherman,” said the voice on the tape. “He
said if I would testify against you and corroborate the other witness,
he’d give me immunity. If I didn’t, then I’d be treated as an
accomplice, and they’d charge me with these…felonies.”</p>
<p>And then:</p>
<p>“He even gave me these Xeroxes of stories in the newspapers. He
practically drew me a map. These were the correct stories, and these
were the ones you concocted. I’m supposed to agree with the correct
stories. If I say what actually happened, I go to prison.”</p>
<p>The lying bitch! He had put her in the box, of course—but he hadn’t
drawn her any map!—hadn’t instructed her as to what to say—hadn’t warned
her away from the truth—</p>
<p>He blurted out: “Judge!”</p>
<p>Kovitsky held up his hand, palm outward, and the tape wound on.</p>
<p>Sherman was startled by the assistant district attorney’s voice. The
judge immediately shut him up. Sherman was braced for what he knew was
coming next.</p>
<p>Maria’s voice: “Just come here.”</p>
<p>He could feel that moment all over again, that moment and that
horrible wrestling match…“Sherman, what’s wrong? What’s wrong with your
back?”…But that was just the start…His own voice, his own cheap lying
voice: “You don’t know how much I’ve missed you, how much I’ve needed
you.” And Maria: “Well…here I am.” Then the dreadful telltale
rustling—and he could smell her breath all over again and feel her hands
on his back.</p>
<p>“Sherman…What’s this on your back?”</p>
<p>The words filled the room in a gush of shame. He wanted to drop
through the floor. He slumped back into his chair and let his chin fall
onto his chest. “Sherman, what is this?”…Her rising voice, his wretched
denials, the thrashing about, her breathless gasps and shrieks…“And a
wire, Sherman!”…“You’re—hurting me!”…“Sherman—you rotten, dishonest
bastard!”</p>
<p>Too true, Maria! Too horribly true!</p>
<p>Kramer listened to it in a red haze of mortification. The Bitch and
the Rat—their tête-à-tête had degenerated into some sort of sordid
ratbitch fight. Pompous little bastard. Creep. Something weird with his
neck. She had scorned him, humiliated him, undercut him, slandered
him—opening him up to a charge of subornation to perjury.</p>
<p>Sherman was astonished by the sound of his own desperate gulps for
air, which came heaving out of the little black machine on the judge’s
desk. It was a mortifying sound. Pain, panic, cowardice, weakness,
deceit, shame, indignity—all of those things at once, followed by an
ungainly clumping. That was the sound of himself fleeing down the
town-house stairs. Somehow he knew everyone in the room could see him
running away with the tape deck and the wire between his legs.</p>
<p>By the time the tape had petered out, Kramer had managed to crawl out
from under his wounded vanity and collect his thoughts. “Judge,” he
said, “I don’t know what—”</p>
<p>Kovitsky broke in: “Just a second. Mr. Killian, can you rewind that
tape? I want to hear the exchange between Mr. McCoy and Mrs. Ruskin
concerning her testimony.”</p>
<p>“But, Judge—”</p>
<p>“We’re gonna listen to it again, Mr. Kramer.”</p>
<p>They listened to it again.</p>
<p>The words sailed by Sherman. He was still drowning in ignominy. How
could he look any of them in the face?</p>
<p>The judge said, “All right, Mr. Killian. What conclusion are you
proposing that the court should draw from this?”</p>
<p>“Judge,” said Killian, “this woman, Mrs. Ruskin, was either
instructed to give certain testimony and omit certain other testimony or
suffer severe consequences, or she thought she was, which amounts to the
same thing. And—”</p>
<p>“That’s absurd!” said the assistant district attorney, Kramer. He was
leaning forward in his chair with a big meaty forefinger pointed at
Killian and a red-mad look on his face.</p>
<p>“Let him finish,” said the judge.</p>
<p>“And furthermore,” said Killian, “as we’ve just heard, she had ample
motivation to testify falsely, not only to protect herself, but to
injure Mr. McCoy, whom she calls a ‘rotten, dishonest bastard.’”</p>
<p>The rotten, dishonest bastard was mortified all over again. What
could be more mortifying than the plain truth? A shouting match broke
out between the assistant district attorney and Killian. What were they
saying? It meant nothing in the face of the obvious, miserable
truth.</p>
<p>The judge roared, “SHUDDUP!” They shut up. “The question of
subornation is not one that interests me at this time, if that’s what
you’re worried about, Mr. Kramer. But I do think there exists the
possibility of tainted testimony before the grand jury.”</p>
<p>“That’s preposterous!” said Kramer. “The woman had two lawyers by her
side at all times. Ask them what I said!”</p>
<p>“If it comes to that, they’ll be asked. But I’m less concerned with
what you said than with what was on her mind when she testified before
the grand jury. You understand, Mr. Kramer?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t, Judge, and—”</p>
<p>Killian broke in: “Judge, I have a second tape.”</p>
<p>Kovitsky said, “All right. What’s the nature of that tape?”</p>
<p>“Judge—”</p>
<p>“Don’t interrupt, Mr. Kramer. You’ll have a chance to be heard. Go
ahead, Mr. Killian. What’s the nature of that tape?”</p>
<p>“This is a conversation with Mrs. Ruskin that Mr. McCoy informs me he
recorded twenty-two days ago, after the first newspaper article
concerning the injuries to Henry Lamb was printed.”</p>
<p>“Where did this conversation take place?”</p>
<p>“Same place as the first one, Judge. Mrs. Ruskin’s apartment.”</p>
<p>“Likewise without her knowledge?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct.”</p>
<p>“And what is the bearing of the tape on this hearing?”</p>
<p>“It gives Mrs. Ruskin’s account of the incident involving Henry Lamb
when she is talking candidly, of her own volition, with Mr. McCoy. It
raises the question of whether or not she might have altered her honest
account when she testified before the grand jury.”</p>
<p>“Judge, this is crazy! Now we’re being told the defendant lives with
a wire on! We already know that he’s a rat, in the parlance of the
street, so why should we believe—”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Mr. Kramer. First, we’re gonna listen to the tape. Then
we’ll evaluate it. Nothing’s engraved in the record yet. Go ahead,
Mr. Killian. Wait a minute, Mr. Killian. First I want to swear Mr. McCoy
in.”</p>
<p>When Kovitsky’s eyes met his, it was all Sherman could do to hold his
gaze. To his surprise, he felt terribly guilty about what he was about
to do. He was about to commit perjury.</p>
<p>Kovitsky had the clerk, Bruzzielli, put him under oath, then asked
him if he had made the two tapes in the way and at the times Killian had
said he had. Sherman said yes, forced himself to keep looking at
Kovitsky, and wondered if the lie showed up somehow on his face.</p>
<p>The tape began: “I knew it. I knew it at the time. We should have
reported it immediately…”</p>
<p>Sherman could barely listen to it. I’m doing something illegal!
Yes…but in the name of the truth…This is the subterranean path to the
light…This is the actual conversation we had…Every word, every sound, is
truth…For this to be suppressed…that would be the greater
dishonesty…Wouldn’t it?…Yes—but I’m doing something illegal! Around and
around it went in his mind as the tape rolled on…And Sherman McCoy, he
who had now vowed to be his animal self, discovered what many had
discovered before him. In well-reared girls and boys, guilt and the
instinct to obey the rules are reflexes, ineradicable ghosts in the
machine.</p>
<p>Even before the Hasidic giant had lumbered down the stairs and
Maria’s whoops of laughter had ceased in this moldering chamber in the
Bronx, the prosecutor, Kramer, was protesting furiously.</p>
<p>“Judge, you can’t allow this—”</p>
<p>“I’ll give you an opportunity to speak.”</p>
<p>“—cheap trick—”</p>
<p>“Mr. Kramer!”</p>
<p>“—influence—”</p>
<p>“MR. KRAMER!”</p>
<p>Kramer shut up.</p>
<p>“Now, Mr. Kramer,” said Kovitsky, “I’m sure you know Mrs. Ruskin’s
voice. Do you agree that that was her voice?”</p>
<p>“Probably, but that’s not the point. The point is—”</p>
<p>“Just a minute. Assuming that to be the case, did what you just heard
on that tape differ from Mrs. Ruskin’s testimony before the grand
jury?”</p>
<p>“Judge…this is preposterous! It’s hard to tell what’s going on on
that tape!”</p>
<p>“Does it differ, Mr. Kramer?”</p>
<p>“It varies.”</p>
<p>“Is ‘varies’ the same as ‘differs’?”</p>
<p>“Judge, there’s no way to tell the conditions under which this thing
was made!”</p>
<p>“Prima facie, Mr. Kramer, does it differ?”</p>
<p>“Prima facie it differs. But you can’t let this cheap trick”—he swung
his hand contemptuously in the direction of McCoy—“influence your—”</p>
<p>“Mr. Kramer—”</p>
<p>“—judgment!” Kramer could see that Kovitsky’s head was gradually
lowering. The white was beginning to appear below his irises. The sea
was beginning to foam. But Kramer couldn’t restrain himself. “The simple
fact is, the grand jury has handed down a valid indictment! You
have—this hearing has no jurisdiction over—”</p>
<p>“Mr. Kramer—”</p>
<p>“—the duly completed deliberations of a grand jury!”</p>
<p>“THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVICE AND COUNSEL, MR. KRAMER!”</p>
<p>Kramer froze, his mouth still open.</p>
<p>“Let me remind you,” Kovitsky said, “that I am the presiding judge
for the grand jury, and I am not enchanted by the possibility that
testimony by a key witness in this case might be tainted.”</p>
<p>Fuming, Kramer shook his head. “Nothing that these
two…individuals”—he flung his hand toward McCoy again—“say in their
little love nest…” He shook his head again, too angry to find the words
to finish the sentence.</p>
<p>“Sometimes that’s when the truth comes out, Mr. Kramer.”</p>
<p>“The truth! Two spoiled rich people, one of them wired up like a
rat—try telling that to the people in that courtroom, Judge!—”</p>
<p>As soon as the words popped out, Kramer knew he had made a mistake,
but he couldn’t hold back.</p>
<p>“—and to the thousands outside that room hanging on every word of
this case! Try telling them—”</p>
<p>He stopped. Kovitsky’s irises again surfed the turbulent sea. He
expected him to explode once more, but instead he did something more
unnerving. He smiled. The head was down, the beak was out, the irises
hydroplaned over the ocean, and he smiled.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Kramer. I will.”</p>
<p>By the time Judge Kovitsky returned to the courtroom, the
demonstrators were having a merry time for themselves, talking at the
top of their voices, cackling, walking around, and pulling faces and
otherwise showing the platoon of white-shirted court officers who was
boss. They quieted down a bit when they saw Kovitsky, but as much out of
curiosity as anything else. They were wound up.</p>
<p>Sherman and Killian headed for the defendant’s desk, a table out in
front of the judge’s bench, and the falsetto singsong started up
again.</p>
<p>“Sherrrr-maaannnn…”</p>
<p>Kramer was over by the clerk’s table, talking to a tall white man in
a cheap gabardine suit.</p>
<p>“That’s the aforesaid Bernie Fitzgibbon, in whom you have no faith,”
said Killian. He was grinning. Then he said, indicating Kramer, “Keep
your eye on that sucker’s face.”</p>
<p>Sherman stared without comprehending.</p>
<p>Kovitsky still had not ascended to the bench. He stood about ten feet
away, talking to his secretary, the redheaded man. The noise in the
spectators’ section grew louder. Kovitsky walked slowly up the steps to
the bench without looking in their direction. He stood at the bench with
his eyes down, as if he were looking at something on the floor.</p>
<p>All at once—KAPOW! The gavel—it was like a cherry bomb.</p>
<p>“YOU! SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN!”</p>
<p>The demonstrators froze for a moment, shocked by the furious volume
of this little man’s voice.</p>
<p>“SO YOU INSI-I-IST…ON TESTING…THE WI-I-I-ILL…OF THIS COURT?”</p>
<p>They grew silent and began to take their places.</p>
<p>“Very well. Now, in the case of the People versus Sherman McCoy, the
grand jury has returned an indictment. Pursuant to my authority to
supervise the grand jury’s proceedings, I am ordering that indictment
dismissed in the interests of justice, without prejudice and with leave
to re-present by the district attorney.”</p>
<p>“Your Honor!” Kramer was on his feet, his hand in the air.</p>
<p>“Mr. Kramer—”</p>
<p>“Your action will do irreparable damage not only to the People’s
case—”</p>
<p>“Mr. Kramer—”</p>
<p>“—but to the cause of the People as well. Your Honor, in this
courtroom today”—he gestured toward the spectators’ section and the
demonstrators—“are many members of the community so vitally affected by
this case, and it ill behooves the criminal-justice system of this
county—”</p>
<p>“MR. KRAMER! KINDLY BEHOOVE ME NO ILL-BEHOOVES!”</p>
<p>“Your Honor—”</p>
<p>“MR. KRAMER! THE COURT DIRECTS YOU TO SHUT UP!”</p>
<p>Kramer looked up at Kovitsky with his mouth wide open, as if the wind
had been knocked out of him.</p>
<p>“Now, Mr. Kramer—”</p>
<p>But Kramer had gotten his breath back. “Your Honor, I want the record
to show that the court raised its voice. Shouted, to be precise.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Kramer…the court is going to raise…MORE THAN ITS VOICE! What
makes you think you can come before the bench waving the banner of
community pressure? The law is not a creature of the few or of the many.
The court is not swayed by your threats. The court is aware of your
conduct before Judge Auerbach in the criminal court. You waved a
petition, Mr. Kramer! You waved it in the air, like a banner!” Kovitsky
raised his right hand and waved it about. “You were on TELEVISION,
Mr. Kramer! An artist drew a picture of you brandishing your petition
like Robespierre or Danton, and you were on TELEVISION! You played to
the mob, didn’t you—and perhaps there are those in this courtroom RIGHT
NOW WHO ENJOYED that performance, Mr. Kramer. Well, I got NEWS for you!
Those who come into THIS courtroom waving banners…LOSE THEIR ARMS!…DO I
MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?”</p>
<p>“Your Honor, I was merely—”</p>
<p>“DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Honor.”</p>
<p>“All right. Now, I am dismissing the indictment in the case of the
People versus McCoy, with leave to re-present.”</p>
<p>“Your Honor! I must repeat—such an action would irreparably damage
the People’s case!” Kramer blurted the words out so that Kovitsky
couldn’t overpower him with his tremendous voice. Kovitsky seemed
surprised by the brashness of his declaration and by his vehemence. He
froze, and that gave the demonstrators just enough courage to erupt.</p>
<p>“Yagggghhh!…No more Park Avenue Justice!” One popped up out of his
seat, and then another and another. The tall one with the earring was in
the front row with his fist in the air. “Whitewash!” he yelled.
“Whitewash!”</p>
<p>KAPOW! The gavel exploded again. Kovitsky stood up and put his fists
on his desktop and leaned forward. “The officers will…REMOVE THAT MAN!”
With that, Kovitsky’s right arm shot out and pointed toward the tall
demonstrator with the earring. Two court officers in short-sleeved white
shirts, with .38s on their hips, moved toward him.</p>
<p>“You can’t remove the People!” he shouted. “You can’t remove the
People!”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Kovitsky, “but YOU will be removed!”</p>
<p>The officers closed in on either side of the man and began pushing
him toward the exit. He looked back at his confreres, but they seemed
confused. They were yammering, but they didn’t have the heart to take on
Kovitsky en masse.</p>
<p>KAPOW!</p>
<p>“SILENCE!” said Kovitsky. As soon as the crowd was reasonably quiet,
Kovitsky looked toward Fitzgibbon and Kramer. “Court is adjourned.”</p>
<p>The spectators stood up, and their yammering now grew into an angry
rumble as they headed toward the door, glowering at Kovitsky as they
went. Nine court officers created a line between the spectators and the
bar. Two of them had their hands resting on the handles of their
revolvers. There were muffled shouts, but Sherman couldn’t make them
out. Killian got up and started walking toward Kovitsky. Sherman
followed him.</p>
<p>A tremendous commotion from behind. Sherman spun around. A tall black
man had burst through the line of court officers. It was the one with
the gold earring, the one Kovitsky had ordered out of the court.
Apparently the court officers had deposited him out in the hallway, and
now he had returned, in a rage. He was already past the bar. He headed
toward Kovitsky, his eyes blazing.</p>
<p>“You bald-headed old pussy! You bald-headed old pussy!”</p>
<p>Three officers left the line that was trying to herd the
demonstrators out of the courtroom. One of them grabbed the tall man by
the arm, but he spun away.</p>
<p>“Park Avenue justice!”</p>
<p>Demonstrators now began surging through the breach in the line of
officers, rumbling and growling and trying to figure out just how fierce
they wanted to be. Sherman stared at them, paralyzed by the sight. Now
it begins! A feeling of fear…anticipation!…Now it begins! The court
officers are falling back, trying to stay between the mob and the judge
and the court personnel. The demonstrators are milling about, growling,
baying, building up steam, trying to figure out just how powerful they
are and how brave.</p>
<p>Booooo!…Yeggghhh!…Yaaaggghhh!…Yo! Goldberg!…You bald-headed old
pussy!</p>
<p>All at once, just to his left, Sherman sees the wild rawboned form of
Quigley. He’s joined the court officers. He’s trying to herd the mob
back. He has a crazy look on his face.</p>
<p>“Okay, Jack, that’s enough. It’s all over. Everybody’s going home
now, Jack.” He calls them all Jack. He’s armed, but the revolver remains
somewhere under his teal-green sport jacket. The court officers are
edging slowly backward. They keep moving their hands toward the holsters
on their hips. They touch the butts of the revolvers, then pull their
hands away, as if terrified of what would happen in this room if they
unsheathed the weapons and started firing away.</p>
<p>Pushing and shoving…a terrific thrashing about…Quigley!…Quigley grabs
a demonstrator by the wrist and twists his arm behind his back and jerks
it up—Aaaagggh!—and kicks his legs out from under him. Two of the court
officers, the one called Brucie and the big one with the tire of fat
around his waist, come backing past Sherman, crouched over, hands on the
guns in their holsters. Brucie starts yelling over his shoulder to
Kovitsky: “Get on your elevator, Judge! F’r Chrissake, get on your
elevator!” But Kovitsky doesn’t budge. He’s glowering at the mob.</p>
<p>The tall one, the one with the gold earring, is barely a foot from
the two officers. He doesn’t try to get past them. He has his head stuck
way up in the air on his long neck, yelling at Kovitsky: “You
bald-headed old pussy!”</p>
<p>“Sherman!” It’s Killian, by his side. “Come on! We’re going down in
the judge’s elevator!” Feels Killian tugging at his elbow, but he’s
rooted to the spot. Now it begins! Why postpone it?</p>
<p>A blur. He looks up. A furious figure in a blue work shirt charging
toward him. A contorted face. An enormous bony finger. “Time’s up, Park
Avenue!”</p>
<p>Sherman braces. Suddenly—Quigley. Quigley steps between the two of
them and with an utterly crazy smile sticks his face in the man’s and
says, “Hi!”</p>
<p>Startled, the man stares at him, and in that moment, still looking
straight into his eyes and smiling, Quigley raises his left foot and
smashes it down on the man’s toe. A terrific yelp.</p>
<p>That sets the mob off. Yagggghhhh!…Ged’im!…Ged’im!…Shoving past the
court officers. Brucie pushes the tall black man with the earring. He
goes reeling to one side. All at once he’s directly in front of Sherman.
He stares. He’s amazed. Face to face! And now what? He just stares.
Sherman’s transfixed…terrified…Now! He ducks, pivots on his hip, and
turns his back—now!—it begins now! He wheels about and drives his fist
into the man’s solar plexus.</p>
<p>“Ooooo!”</p>
<p>The big sonofabitch is sinking, with his mouth open and his eyes
bugged out and his Adam’s apple convulsing. He hits the floor.</p>
<p>“Sherman! Come on!” Killian is pulling on his arm. But Sherman is
frozen. He can’t take his eyes off the man with the gold earring. He’s
on the floor, doubled up on his side, gasping. The earring dangles off
his earlobe at a crazy angle.</p>
<p>Sherman is knocked backward by two thrashing forms. Quigley. Quigley
has a tall white boy around the neck with one arm and appears to be
trying to drive his nose back up into his skull with the heel of the
other hand. The white boy is going Aaaaaah, aaaaaah and bleeding
terribly. The nose is a bloody pudding. Quigley is grunting Unnnnh unnnh
unnnh. He lets the white boy fall to the floor, then smashes the heel of
his shoe into his arm. A dreadful Aaaaah. Quigley takes Sherman by the
arm and pushes him backward.</p>
<p>“Come on, Sherm!” Sherm. “Let’s get the fuck outta here!”</p>
<p>I drove my forearm into his belly—and he went Ooooooo and hit the
floor. One last look at the dangling earring—</p>
<p>Now Quigley is pushing him backward and Killian is pulling him.</p>
<p>“Come on!” yells Killian. “You outta your fucking mind?”</p>
<p>There was only a little semicircle of court officers, plus Quigley,
between the mob and Sherman and Killian and the judge, his secretary,
and the clerk, who squeezed back through the door into the judge’s
chamber, shoulder to shoulder, jostling about. The demonstrators—plenty
for them to be furious about now! One of them is trying to push through
the door…Brucie can’t hold him back…Quigley…He’s pulled his revolver
out. He holds it up in the air. He thrusts his face toward the
demonstrator in the doorway.</p>
<p>“Okay, faggot! You want a new hole in your fucking nose?”</p>
<p>The man freezes—freezes like a statue. It’s not the revolver. It’s
the look on Quigley’s face that gets him.</p>
<p>One beat…two beats…That’s all they need. The court officer with the
big tire of flab has the door to the judge’s elevator open. They’re
herding everybody on—Kovitsky, his secretary, the big clerk, Killian.
Sherman backs in with Quigley, Brucie and Quigley right on top of him.
Three court officers remain in the chamber, ready to draw their guns.
But the mob has lost steam, lost heart. Quigley. The look on his face.
Okay, faggot. You want a new hole in your fucking nose?</p>
<p>The elevator starts down. It’s overpoweringly hot inside. All jammed
together. Aaah, aaaahh, aaaaaah, aaaaahhh. Sherman realizes it’s
himself, gulping for air, himself and Quigley, too, and Brucie and the
other court officer, the fat one. Aaaaaah, aaaahhhhh, aaaaahhhhh,
aaaahhhh, aaaaahhhhhhh.</p>
<p>“Sherm!” It’s Quigley, talking between gasps, “You cold-cocked…that
cocksucker…Sherm! You…cold-cocked him!”</p>
<p>Sank to the floor. Doubled up. The earring dangled. Now!—and I
triumphed. He’s consumed with cold fear—they’ll get me!—and soaring
anticipation. Again! I want to do it again!</p>
<p>“Don’t congratulate yourselves.” It was Kovitsky, in a low stern
voice. “The whole thing was a fucking fiasco. You don’t even know how
bad it was. I shouldn’t have adjourned the court so fast. I should’ve
talked to them. They…don’t know. They don’t even know what they’ve
done.”</p>
<p>“Judge,” said Brucie, “it ain’t over yet. We got demonstrators in the
halls and outside the building.”</p>
<p>“Where outside?”</p>
<p>“It’s mainly on the front steps, on 161st Street, but some a them are
around on Walton Avenue, too. Where’s your car, Judge?”</p>
<p>“The usual place. The pit.”</p>
<p>“Maybe one a us oughta drive it around to the Concourse
entrance.”</p>
<p>Kovitsky thought for a moment. “Fuck it. I won’t give ’em the
satisfaction.”</p>
<p>“They won’t even know about it, Judge. I don’t mean to alarm you, but
they’re already out there…talking about you…They got a sound system and
everything.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah?” said Kovitsky. “They ever heard of obstructing
governmental administration?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think they ever hearda nothing except raising hell, but they
know how to do that.”</p>
<p>“Well, thanks, Brucie.” Kovitsky began to smile. He turned to
Killian. “Remember the time I ordered you off the judge’s elevator? I
can’t even remember how you got on.”</p>
<p>Killian smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>“And you wouldn’t get off, and I said I was holding you in contempt?
And you said, ‘Contempt of what? Contempt of elevator?’ You remember
that?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you better believe I remember that, Judge, but I always hoped
you wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“You know what burned me up? You were right. That was what burned me
up.”</p>
<p>Even before the elevator reached the first floor, they could hear the
tremendous BRAAANNNNNGG! of the alarm.</p>
<p>“Christ. What jerk set that off?” said Brucie. “Who the hell they
think’s gonna respond? Every officer in the building’s already at a
station.”</p>
<p>Kovitsky was somber again. He was shaking his head. He looked so
small, a bony little bald-headed man in voluminous black robes squeezed
into this sweltering elevator. “They don’t know how bad this is. They
just don’t fucking know…I’m their only friend, their only friend…”</p>
<p>When the elevator door opened, the noise of the
alarm—BRAAANNNNNGGGGG!—was overpowering. They emerged into a little
vestibule. One door led to the street. Another led to the ground-floor
hallway of the island fortress. Brucie shouted to Sherman, “How you
figuring on getting outta here?”</p>
<p>Quigley answered, “We got a car, but Christ knows where it is. The
fucking driver was terrified just fucking driving up to the
building.”</p>
<p>Brucie said, “Where’s he supposed to be?”</p>
<p>Quigley said, “The Walton Avenue door, but if I know that faggot,
he’s halfway to fucking Candy.”</p>
<p>“Candy?”</p>
<p>“It’s the fucking town he comes from, in Ceylon, Candy. The closer we
get to this fucking building, the more he starts talking about this
fucking town he comes from, Candy. The fucking town is called
Candy.”</p>
<p>Brucie’s eyes opened wide, and he yelled, “Hey, Judge!”</p>
<p>Kovitsky was heading through the door that led into the interior
hallway of the building.</p>
<p>“Judge! Don’t go in there! They’re all over the halls!”</p>
<p>Now! Again! Sherman bolted for the door and ran after the little
figure in black.</p>
<p>Killian’s voice: “Sherman! What the hell you doing!”</p>
<p>Quigley’s voice: “Sherm! Jesus Christ!”</p>
<p>Sherman found himself in a vast marble hall filled with the
stupendous sound of the alarm. Kovitsky was up ahead of him, walking so
fast that his robes were billowing out. He looked like a crow trying to
gain altitude. Sherman broke into a trot to try to catch up. A figure
came running past him. Brucie.</p>
<p>“Judge! Judge!”</p>
<p>Brucie caught up with Kovitsky and tried to grab his left arm.
Sherman was now right behind them. With a furious gesture Kovitsky
forced the court officer’s hand away.</p>
<p>“Judge, where you going! What you doing!”</p>
<p>“Gotta tell ’em!” said Kovitsky.</p>
<p>“Judge—they’ll kill you!”</p>
<p>“Gotta tell ’em!”</p>
<p>Sherman was now aware that the others were pulling up on either side,
running…the fat court officer…Killian…Quigley…All the faces in the
hallway stopped and stared, trying to figure out what in the name of God
they were looking at…this furious little judge in his black robes with
his outriders running along beside him yelling: “Judge! Don’t do
it!”</p>
<p>Shouts in the corridor…That’s him!…Yo! That’s that
fucker!…BRAAANNNNGGGG!…The alarm battered one and all with its shock
waves.</p>
<p>Brucie tried again to restrain Kovitsky. “Leggo my FUCKING ARM!”
screamed Kovitsky. “That’s a FUCKING ORDER, BRUCIE!”</p>
<p>Sherman broke into a trot to keep up. He was only a half step behind
the judge. He searched out the faces in the hallway. Now!—again! They
went around a bend in the hallway. They were in the great Moderne lobby
that led out onto the terrace overlooking 161st Street. Fifty or sixty
onlookers, fifty or sixty rapt faces, were inside the lobby, looking out
at the terrace. Through the glass doors Sherman could see the silhouette
of a mass of figures.</p>
<p>Kovitsky reached the front doors and pushed one open and paused.
BRRAAAANNNGGGG! Brucie yelled: “Don’t go out there, Judge! I’m begging
you!”</p>
<p>At the center of the terrace was a microphone on a stanchion, such as
you might see on a bandstand. At the microphone was a tall black man in
a black suit and a white shirt. Black people and white people were
crowded in on either side of him. A white woman with wiry gray-blond
hair was next to him. A whole mob, black and white, was up on the
terrace and on the stairs that led up to the terrace from either side.
Judging by the noise, hundreds more, possibly thousands, were on the
grand staircase and the sidewalk down below on 161st Street. Then
Sherman realized who the tall man at the microphone was. Reverend
Bacon.</p>
<p>He spoke to the crowd in a steady, controlled baritone, as if each
word were one more resolute footstep of fate.</p>
<p>“We have put our trust in this society…and in this power
structure…and what’ve we got?” Much yammering and many angry shouts from
the crowd. “We have believed their promises…and what’ve we got?” Groans,
moans, yelps. “We believed in their justice. They told us Justice was
blind. They told us Justice was a blind woman…an impartial
woman…see?…And this woman did not know the color of your skin…And who
does that blind woman turn out to be? What’s her name? When she plays
her lying racist games, what’s the face she wears?” Shouts, boos, howls,
cries for blood. “We know that face, we know that name…MY-RON
KO-VIT-SKY!” Boos, yowls, cackles, shouts, a colossal baying noise rose
up from the mob. “MY-RON KO-VIT-SKY!” The noise welled up into a roar.
“But we can wait, brothers and sisters…we can wait…We waited this long,
and we got no place more to go. WE CAN WAIT!…We can wait for the power
structure’s henchmen to show their faces. He’s in there. He’s in there!”
Bacon kept his face turned toward the microphone and the crowd, but he
flung his arm and his pointed finger behind him in the direction of the
building. “And he knows the people are here, for…he…is…not…blind…He
lives in fear on this island, in the mighty sea of people, for he knows
that the people—and justice!—wait for him. And there is no escape!” The
crowd roared, and Bacon leaned to one side for a moment while the woman
with wiry gray-blond hair whispered something in his ear.</p>
<p>At that moment Kovitsky threw open both the glass doors in front of
him. His robes billowed out like enormous black wings.</p>
<p>“Judge! For God’s sake!”</p>
<p>Kovitsky stopped in the doorway, arms outstretched. The moment
lengthened…lengthened…The arms dropped. The billowing wings collapsed
against his frail body. He turned around and walked back inside the
lobby. His eyes were down, and he was muttering.</p>
<p>“Their only friend, their only fucking friend.” He looked at the
court officer. “Okay, Brucie, let’s go.”</p>
<p>No! Now! Sherman yelled out: “No, Judge! Do it! I’ll go with
you!”</p>
<p>Kovitsky spun about and looked at Sherman. Obviously he hadn’t even
known he was there. A furious scowl. “What the hell—”</p>
<p>“Do it!” said Sherman. “Do it, Judge!”</p>
<p>Kovitsky just looked at him. At Brucie’s urging they were now all
heading back down the hallway at a good clip. The corridors were much
more crowded…an ugly mob…</p>
<p>That’s Kovitsky! That’s the one! Shouts…a tremendous
rumble…BRRAAAANNNGGG!—the alarm battered and battered and ricocheted off
the marble, doubling, trebling…An older man, not a demonstrator, came up
from the side, as if to confront Kovitsky, pointing and shouting, “You…”
Sherman lunged at him and screamed: “Get your fucking face outta the
way!” The man jumped back, his mouth hanging open. His
expression—frightened! Now!—again!—drive a fist into his belly, mash his
nose into a pulp, ram a heel into his eye!—Sherman turned to look at
Kovitsky.</p>
<p>Kovitsky was staring at him the way you’d stare at a lunatic. So was
Killian. So were the two court officers.</p>
<p>“You outta your mind?” yelled Kovitsky. “You wanna get killed?”</p>
<p>“Judge,” said Sherman, “it don’t matter! It don’t matter!”</p>
<p>He smiled. He could feel his upper lip stretching across his teeth.
He let out a short harsh red laugh. Leaderless, the mob in the corridor
held back, not sure what they were dealing with. Sherman sought out
their faces, as if to obliterate them with his very eyes. He was
terrified—and quite ready!—again!</p>
<p>The little band beat a retreat down the marble halls.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>A year later, to the day, the following article appeared on page B1
of the Metropolitan News section of The New York Times:</p>
<p>FINANCIER IS ARRAIGNED</p>
<p>IN HONOR STUDENT’S DEATH</p>
<p>By Overton Holmes, Jr.</p>
<p>Former Wall Street financier Sherman McCoy was brought in handcuffs
to the Bronx yesterday and arraigned on a charge of manslaughter in the
death of Henry Lamb, a 19-year-old black honor student who had been the
pride of a South Bronx housing project.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb died Monday night at Lincoln Hospital as a result of
cerebral injuries suffered when he was struck by Mr. McCoy’s
Mercedes-Benz sports car on Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx thirteen
months ago. He had never regained consciousness.</p>
<p>Demonstrators from the All People’s Solidarity and other
organizations chanted “Wall Street murderer,” “Capitalist killer,” and
“Justice at last,” as detectives led Mr. McCoy toward the Bronx Criminal
Courts Building on East 161st St. Mr. McCoy’s alleged role in Mr. Lamb’s
injuries became the center of a political storm last year.</p>
<p>A Patrician Figure</p>
<p>Asked by reporters to comment on the contrast between his Wall Street
and Park Avenue background and his current situation, Mr. McCoy yelled
out, “I have nothing to do with Wall Street and Park Avenue. I’m a
professional defendant. I’ve undergone a year of legal harassment, and
I’ll undergo another—or perhaps another 8andandandandf13; to 25.”</p>
<p>This was an apparent reference to the prison sentence he will face if
convicted of the new charge. Bronx District Attorney Richard A. Weiss is
said to have prepared a 50-page indictment to present to a grand jury.
Mr. Weiss’s tenacious prosecution of the case was widely regarded as the
key to his successful bid for reelection in November.</p>
<p>A tall, patrician figure, son of the eminent Wall Street lawyer John
Campbell McCoy and a product of St. Paul’s School and Yale, Mr. McCoy,
39, was dressed in an open-necked sport shirt, khaki pants, and hiking
shoes. This was in sharp contrast to the ,000 custom-tailored English
suits he was famous for as the legendary ,000,000-a-year “king of the
bond market” for Pierce andandandand Pierce.</p>
<p>As he was ushered through a basement door of the courthouse into the
Bronx Central Booking facility, Mr. McCoy said in response to a
reporter’s query, “I told you, I’m a career defendant. I now dress for
jail, even though I haven’t been convicted of any crime.”</p>
<p>Diminished LifeStyle</p>
<p>At his arraignment six hours later, Mr. McCoy appeared before Judge
Samuel Auerbach with a slightly swollen left jaw and abrasions on the
knuckles of both hands. Questioned about it by Judge Auerbach, he said,
clenching his fists, “Don’t worry, Judge. It’s something I’ll take care
of myself.”</p>
<p>Police officials said Mr. McCoy had become involved in a “dispute”
with two other prisoners in a communal detention cell, resulting in a
scuffle, but had declined offers of medical treatment.</p>
<p>When the judge asked him how he pleaded, Mr. McCoy said in a loud
voice, “Absolutely innocent.” Against the judge’s advice, he insisted on
representing himself at the arraignment and indicated he will do
likewise during his forthcoming trial.</p>
<p>Sources close to Mr. McCoy, whose worth was once estimated as more
than ,000,000, said that a year of extraordinary legal expenses and
entanglements has left him “barely able to pay the rent.” Formerly the
owner of a ,200,000 cooperative apartment at 816 Park Avenue, he now
rents two modest rooms in a postwar high-rise building on East 34th
Street near First Avenue.</p>
<p>The original charge against Mr. McCoy, reckless endangerment, was
thrown out last June during a turbulent hearing in the courtroom of
former Supreme Court Justice Myron Kovitsky. Amid the ensuing storm of
protest in the black community, Mr. Weiss brought the charge before a
second grand jury and obtained a new indictment.</p>
<p>The Bronx Democratic organization, responding to community demands,
refused to renominate Judge Kovitsky, and he was soundly defeated in his
November reelection attempt. He was replaced by veteran Justice Jerome
Meldnick. Mr. McCoy’s trial, in February, ended in a hung jury, with all
three white jurors and one Hispanic juror holding out for acquittal.</p>
<p>Two months ago a Bronx jury awarded Mr. Lamb 2,000,000 in a civil
action against Mr. McCoy, who has appealed. Recently, Attorney Albert
Vogel, acting for Mr. Lamb, charged that Mr. McCoy was hiding assets in
order to evade the judgment. The assets in dispute are the proceeds of
the sale of his Park Avenue apartment and his house in Southampton,
L.I., which he attempted to give outright to his estranged wife, Judy,
and their seven-year-old daughter, Campbell. The court has frozen these
funds, along with the remainder of Mr. McCoy’s securities and salable
personal belongings, pending the outcome of his appeal of his civil
damages.</p>
<p>Mrs. McCoy and her daughter reportedly have moved to the Midwest, but
Mrs. McCoy was in the spectator section of the courtroom yesterday,
apparently unrecognized by the noisy group of demonstrators, black and
white, who occupied most of the seats. At one point, Mr. McCoy looked
toward his wife, smiled slightly, and raised his left hand in a
clenched-fist salute. The meaning of this gesture was unclear.
Mrs. McCoy refused to speak to reporters.</p>
<p>“Rent-Controlled Love Nest”</p>
<p>Mr. McCoy’s marriage was rocked by the revelation that Maria Ruskin
Chirazzi, heiress of the Ruskin air-charter fortune, was in the
automobile with Mr. McCoy at the time Mr. Lamb was struck. The couple,
it developed, had been conducting an affair in a secret apartment later
dubbed the “rent-controlled love nest.” Mrs. Chirazzi’s then-husband,
Arthur Ruskin, died of a heart attack shortly before her involvement in
the case was made known.</p>
<p>District Attorney Weiss had been prepared to begin a new trial on the
reckless endangerment charge when Mr. Lamb died, exposing Mr. McCoy to
the more serious charge of manslaughter. Mr. Weiss had already announced
that Assistant District Attorney Raymond I. Andriutti would head the
prosecution. In an unusual development, Mr. Weiss was forced to remove
the prosecutor of the first trial, Lawrence N. Kramer, from the case
when it was disclosed that Mr. Kramer had interceded with a landlord to
secure the so-called rent-controlled love nest apartment for a friend,
Shelly Thomas, an advertising copywriter. Mr. Kramer, who is married,
met Ms. Thomas when she served as a juror in an unrelated case which he
prosecuted. The defendant in that case, Herbert (Herbert 92X) Cantrell,
has obtained a reversal of his first-degree manslaughter conviction on
the grounds of “prosecutorial misconduct.”</p>
<p>Mr. Andriutti said yesterday that he would call Mrs. Chirazzi as a
prosecution witness in Mr. McCoy’s new trial despite the fact that it
was a controversy over her testimony before a grand jury that led to the
dismissal of the first indictment by Judge Kovitsky. She did not testify
at the first trial.</p>
<p>Fashionable Estate</p>
<p>Mr. McCoy’s legal problems were multiplied yesterday when a
real-estate-firm employee, Sally Rawthrote, filed suit against him in
Manhattan Civil Court for 00,000. Ms. Rawthrote had received a 92,000
commission for the ,200,000 sale of Mr. McCoy’s Park Avenue apartment.
But Mr. Lamb, via Mr. Vogel, sued her for the 92,000 on the grounds that
the money should go toward the payment of Mr. Lamb’s 2,000,000 judgment
against Mr. McCoy. Mrs. Rawthrote’s suit yesterday accused Mr. McCoy of
“deceptively proffering encumbered property for sale.” In a statement
she said she was “merely hedging against the possible loss of my
rightful commission” and in fact wishes Mr. McCoy well.</p>
<p>Just how Mr. McCoy might deal with this and other complex legal
matters growing out of the case was uncertain. Reached at his home on
Long Island, Mr. McCoy’s former attorney, Thomas Killian, said that he
was no longer able to represent Mr. McCoy due to Mr. McCoy’s lack of
sufficient funds to mount a defense.</p>
<p>Mr. Killian himself currently has his hands full with a barrage of
lawsuits brought by his new neighbors in the fashionable North Shore
community of Lattingtown. He recently purchased the 20-acre Phipps
estate and commissioned the noted Neo-Shingle architect, Hudnall
Stallworth, to design a large addition to the main house, which is
listed by the National Historic Registry. Local preservationists object
to any alteration of the stately Georgian structure.</p>
<p>Mr. Killian is heated in his support of Mr. McCoy, however. In a
speech before a private luncheon group yesterday, he reportedly referred
to the manslaughter indictment with a common tauro-scatological
expletive and was quoted as saying, “If this case was being tried in
foro conscientiae 〔in the court of the conscience〕, the defendants
would be Abe Weiss, Reginald Bacon, and Peter Fallow of The City
Light.”</p>
<p>Milton Lubell, spokesman for Mr. Weiss, said the District Attorney
would not respond to “kibbitzing” by “someone no longer involved in the
case.” He added: “Only preferential treatment by certain elements of the
judicial system has kept Mr. McCoy aloof from the law so far. It is
tragic that it has required the death of Henry Lamb, who represented the
highest ideals of our city, to see to it that justice will at last be
served in his case.”</p>
<p>Buck Jones, a spokesman for the Reverend Mr. Bacon’s All People’s
Solidarity, dismissed Mr. Killian’s charge as “the usual racist
double-talk by a racist mouthpiece for a well-known capitalist racist”
who seeks to “avoid paying what he owes for the racist destruction of a
fine young man.”</p>
<p>Mr. Fallow, winner of a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the McCoy
case, could not be reached for comment. He was reportedly on a sailing
vessel in the Aegean Sea with his bride of two weeks, Lady Evelyn,
daughter of Sir Gerald Steiner, the publisher and financier.</p>

<p>Additional Praise for</p>
<p>The Bonfire Of The Vanities</p>
<p>“Brilliant—Bonfire illumines the modern madness that 〔was〕 New York
in the 1980s with the intense precision of a laser beam.”</p>
<p>—People</p>
<p>“Impossible to put down.”</p>
<p>—The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>“Marvelous.”</p>
<p>—Business Week</p>
<p>“It’s The Human Comedy, on a skyscraper scale and at a taxi-meter
pace.”</p>
<p>—Newsweek</p>
<p>“Vintage Wolfe…The plot is an astonishing intricate machine that
manages to mesh at every turn.”</p>
<p>—The New York Times</p>
<p>“It’s a monstrous pleasure to watch this world burn…. Wolfe’s
conflagration sweeps away New York in a great tragicomic circus….
Wolfe’s the uncanny master of the inside angle on style, our best
meteorologist of hip.”</p>
<p>—New Haven Register</p>
<p>“One of the most impressive novels of the decade.”</p>
<p>—Library Journal</p>
<p>“Nasty, satirical, probing, and dead-on accurate…Wolfe falls so
naturally into this colorful, supercharged account of New York high life
and low life that it’s hard to believe he hasn’t been writing fiction
all his life…. It also reads at a veritable gallop—those pages flash by
you as you watch, with fascinated horror, the meticulously charted fall
of Sherman McCoy.”</p>
<p>—The Seattle Times</p>
<p>“Reverberates with subjects in today’s news. However, it also touches
passionately on perennial themes that will give it staying power….
Bonfire is news that will stay news because a century hence readers will
find preserved in it the strong flavor of some unfortunately important
slices of life in our time.”</p>
<p>—George F. Will</p>
<p>“A smash.”</p>
<p>—The Philadelphia Inquirer</p>
<p>“A swirling, satisfying, educational, noisy, moral whirlpool of a
book…Plot and principals sumptuous enough to make Jackie Collins’
Hollywood seem like Hee Haw by comparison.”</p>
<p>—The Dallas Morning News</p>
<p>“Wolfe leaves no head unbashed…. His eye and ear for detailed
observation are incomparable; and observation is to the satirist what
bullets are to a gun.”</p>
<p>—Boston Sunday Globe</p>
<p>Doffing his hat,</p>
<p>the author dedicates this book to</p>
<p>COUNSELOR EDDIE HAYES</p>
<p>who walked among the flames,</p>
<p>pointing at the lurid lights.</p>
<p>And he wishes to express</p>
<p>his deep appreciation to</p>
