<h4 id="death-new-york-style">26. Death New York Style</h4>
<p>It was the Dead Mouse himself, Sir Gerald Steiner, who got the bright
idea. Steiner, Brian Highridge, and Fallow were meeting in Steiner’s
office. Just being here, breathing the Mouse’s own eminent air, gave
Fallow a warm feeling. Thanks to his triumphs with the McCoy case, the
upper rooms and inner circles of The City Light were open to him.
Steiner’s office was a big corner room overlooking the Hudson River.
There was a large wooden desk, a Mission-style worktable, six armchairs,
and that necessary proof of high corporate position, a couch. Otherwise
the decor was Working Newspaperman. Steiner kept promiscuous heaps of
newspapers, reference books, and copy paper on his desk and the
worktable. A computer terminal and a manual typewriter stood on
workmanlike metal stands near his swivel chair. A Reuters wire-service
machine chattered away in a corner. A police radio was in another. It
was now silent, but he had kept the thing on for a year before its yawps
and bursts of static finally wore him out. The plate-glass windows,
which offered a sweeping view of the river and the clam-gray Hoboken
shore, had no curtains, only venetian blinds. The venetian blinds gave
the vista a Light Industry, Working Newspaperman aspect.</p>
<p>The purpose of this summit meeting was to figure out how to proceed
with Fallow’s smoking-hot tip: namely, that Maria Ruskin was the mystery
woman, the foxy brunette who took the wheel of McCoy’s Mercedes roadster
after McCoy ran down Henry Lamb. Four reporters—including, Fallow was
happy to see, Robert Goldman—had been assigned to do legwork on the
story. Legwork for him; they were his drudges. So far they had
established only that Maria Ruskin was out of the country, probably in
Italy. As for the young artist, Filippo Chirazzi, they had been unable
to find any trace of him at all.</p>
<p>Steiner was sitting at his desk with his jacket off, his tie pulled
down, and his red felt suspenders blazing away on his striped shirt,
when it came to him, his bright idea. The City Light’s business section
was currently running a series on “The New Tycoons.” Steiner’s scheme
was to approach Arthur Ruskin as a subject for the series. This would
not be entirely devious, since Ruskin was in fact typical of the “new
tycoon” of latter-day New York, the man of immense, new, inexplicable
wealth. The interviewer of the new tycoon would be Fallow. If he could
get close to the old man, he would play it by ear. At the very least, he
might find out where Maria Ruskin was.</p>
<p>“But do you think he’ll go for it, Jerry?” asked Brian Highridge.</p>
<p>“Oh, I know these chaps,” said Steiner, “and the old ones are the
worst. They’ve made their fifty million or their hundred million—that’s
what the Texans call a unit. Did you know that? They call a hundred
million dollars a unit. I think that’s delightful. A unit, of course, is
a starting point. In any case, this sort of chap makes his great
colossal pile, and he goes to a dinner party, and he’s sitting next to
some pretty young thing, and he’s getting a bit of the old tingle—but
she hasn’t the faintest notion who he is. A hundred million dollars!—and
she’s never even heard his name, and she isn’t interested in who he is
when he tries to tell her. What can he do? He can’t very well go about
with a sign around his neck saying FINANCIAL GIANT. At that point,
believe me, they begin to lose some of their purported scruples
concerning publicity.”</p>
<p>Fallow believed him. It was not for nothing that Steiner had founded
The City Light and kept it going at an operating loss of about ten
million dollars a year. No longer was he merely another financier. He
was the dread buccaneer of the dread City Light.</p>
<p>The Mouse proved to be an able psychologist of the newly and
anonymously rich. Two telephone calls from Brian Highridge and it was
all set. Ruskin said he generally avoided publicity, but in this case he
would make an exception. He told Highridge he would like for the
writer—what was his name? Mr. Fallow?—to be his guest for dinner at La
Boue d’Argent.</p>
<p>When Fallow and Arthur Ruskin reached the restaurant, Fallow pushed
the brass revolving door for the old man. Ruskin lowered his chin
slightly, and then he lowered his eyes, and the most profoundly sincere
smile spread over his face. For an instant Fallow marveled that this
gruff barrel-chested seventy-one-year-old man could be so grateful for a
gesture of such innocuous politeness. In the next instant he realized it
had nothing to do with him and his courtesy at all. Ruskin was merely
feeling the first ambrosial radiations of the greeting that awaited him
beyond the threshold.</p>
<p>As soon as Ruskin entered the vestibule and the light of the
restaurant’s famous sculpture, The Silver Boar, shone upon him, the
fawning began in earnest. The maître d’, Raphael, fairly leaped from
behind his desk and his daybook. Not one but two captains came forward.
They beamed, they bowed, they filled the air with Monsieur Ruskins. The
great financier lowered his chin still further, until it floated on a
cushion of jowl, and he mumbled his replies, and his grin became broader
and broader and, curiously, more and more diffident. It was the smile of
a boy at his own birthday party, the lad who is both humbled and
wondrously elated by the realization that he is in a room full of people
who are happy, abnormally happy, one might say, to see him alive and in
their presence.</p>
<p>To Fallow, Raphael and the two captains gave a few quick Hello, sirs
and returned to sprinkling Ruskin with the sweet nothings of their
calling. Fallow noticed two odd characters in the vestibule, two men in
their mid-thirties, wearing dark suits that seemed to be mere screens
for bodies of pure prole brawn. One appeared to be American, the other
Asian. The latter was so large and had such a huge head, with such wide
flat menacing features, Fallow wondered if he was Samoan. Ruskin noticed
him, too, and Raphael said, with a smug smile, “Secret service. Two
secret services, the American and the Indonesian. Madame Tacaya will be
dining here this evening.” After imparting this bit of news, he smiled
again.</p>
<p>Ruskin turned to Fallow and made a face, without smiling, perhaps
fearing that he could not compete with the wife of the Indonesian
dictator for the restaurant’s attentions and homage. The big Asian eyed
them both. Fallow noticed that he had a cord coming out of his ear.</p>
<p>Raphael smiled again at Ruskin and gestured toward the dining room,
and a procession began, led by Raphael himself, followed by Ruskin and
Fallow, with a captain and a waiter at the rear. They turned right at
the spotlit form of The Silver Boar and headed into the dining room.
Ruskin had a grin on his mug. He loved this. Only the fact that he kept
his eyes downcast prevented him from looking like a complete fool.</p>
<p>At night the dining room was well lit and seemed much more garish
than at lunchtime. The dinner crowd seldom had the social cachet of the
lunch crowd, but the place was packed nonetheless and was roaring with
conversation. Fallow could see cluster after cluster of men with bald
heads and women with pineapple-colored hair.</p>
<p>The procession stopped beside a round table that was far bigger than
any other but was as yet unoccupied. A captain, two waiters, and two
busboys were buzzing about, arranging stemware and silverware in front
of every place. This was evidently Madame Tacaya’s table. Immediately
opposite it was a banquette under the front windows. Fallow and Ruskin
were seated side by side on the banquette. They had a view of the entire
front section, which was all that any true aspirant for the high ground
of La Boue d’Argent required.</p>
<p>Ruskin said, “You wanna know why I like this restaurant?”</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Fallow.</p>
<p>“Because it’s got the best food in New York and the best service.”
Ruskin turned and looked Fallow squarely in the face. Fallow could think
of no adequate response to this revelation.</p>
<p>“Oh, people talk about this social stuff,” said Ruskin, “and sure, a
lot of well-known people come here. But why? Because it’s got great food
and great service.” He shrugged. (No mystery to it.)</p>
<p>Raphael reappeared and asked Ruskin if he cared for a drink.</p>
<p>“Oh, Christ,” said Ruskin, smiling. “I’m not supposed to, but I feel
like a drink. You got any Courvoisier V.S.O.P.?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes.”</p>
<p>“Then gimme a sidecar with the V.S.O.P.”</p>
<p>Fallow ordered a glass of white wine. Tonight he intended to remain
sober. Presently, a waiter arrived with the glass of wine and Ruskin’s
sidecar. Ruskin lifted his glass.</p>
<p>“To Fortune,” he said. “I’m glad my wife’s not here.”</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Fallow, all ears.</p>
<p>“I’m not supposed to drink, especially not a little bomb like this.”
He held the drink up to the light. “But tonight I feel like a drink. It
was Willi Nordhoff who introduced me to sidecars. He used to order them
all the time, over at the old King Cole Bar of the St. Regis. ‘Zitecar,’
he’d say. ‘Mit Fay, Es, Oh, Pay,’ he’d say. You ever run into
Willi?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so,” said Fallow.</p>
<p>“But you know who he is.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Fallow, who had never heard the name in his
life.</p>
<p>“Jesus,” said Ruskin. “I never thought I’d ever become such a great
pal of a Kraut, but I love the guy.”</p>
<p>This thought launched Ruskin on a long soliloquy about the many roads
he had traveled in his career and about the many forks in those roads
and how America was a wonderful country and who would have ever given a
little Jew from Cleveland, Ohio, one chance in a thousand to get where
he was today. He began to paint Fallow the view from the top of the
mountain, ordering a second sidecar as he did. He painted with vigorous
but vague strokes. Fallow was glad they were sitting side by side. It
would be difficult for Ruskin to read the boredom on his face. Every now
and then he ventured a question. He fished about for information as to
where Maria Ruskin might stay when she visited Italy, such as at this
moment, but Ruskin was vague about that, too. He was eager to return to
the story of his life.</p>
<p>The first course arrived. Fallow had ordered a vegetable pâté. The
pâté was a small pinkish semicircle with stalks of rhubarb arranged
around it like rays. It was perched in the upper left-hand quadrant of a
large plate. The plate seemed to be glazed with an odd Art Nouveau
painting of a Spanish galleon on a reddish sea sailing toward
the…sunset…but the setting sun was, in fact, the pâté, with its rhubarb
rays, and the Spanish ship was not done in glaze at all but in different
colors of sauce. It was a painting in sauce. Ruskin’s plate contained a
bed of flat green noodles carefully intertwined to create a basket
weave, superimposed upon which was a flock of butterflies fashioned from
pairs of mushroom slices, for the wings; pimientos, onion slices,
shallots, and capers, for the bodies, eyes, and antennae. Ruskin took no
note of the exotic collage before him. He had ordered a bottle of wine
and was becoming increasingly expansive about the peaks and valleys of
his career. Valleys, yes; oh, he had had to overcome many
disappointments. The main thing was to be decisive. Decisive men made
great decisions not because they were smarter than other people,
necessarily, but because they made more decisions, and by the law of
averages some of them would be great. Did Fallow get it? Fallow nodded.
Ruskin paused only to stare gloomily at the fuss Raphael and his boys
were making over the big round table in front of them. Madame Tacaya is
coming. Ruskin seemed to feel upstaged.</p>
<p>“They all want to come to New York,” he said dismally, without
mentioning whom he was talking about, although it was clear enough.
“This city is what Paris used to be. No matter what they are in their
own country, it starts eating at them, the idea that in New York people
might not give a damn who they are. You know what she is, don’t you?
She’s an empress, and Tacaya’s the emperor. He calls himself president,
but they all do that. They all pay lip service to democracy. You ever
notice that? If Genghis Khan was around today, he’d be President
Genghis, or president-for-life, like Duvalier used to be. Oh, it’s a
great world. There’s ten or twenty million poor devils flinching on
their dirt floors every time the empress wiggles a finger, but she can’t
sleep nights thinking that the people at La Boue d’Argent in New York
might not know who the hell she is.”</p>
<p>Madame Tacaya’s secret-service man stuck his huge Asian head into the
dining room and scanned the house. Ruskin gave him a baleful glance.</p>
<p>“But even in Paris,” he said, “they didn’t come all the way from the
goddamned South Pacific. You ever been to the Middle East?”</p>
<p>“Mmmm-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-no,” said Fallow, who for half a second thought
of faking it.</p>
<p>“You oughta go. You can’t understand what’s going on in the world
unless you go to these places. Jidda, Kuwait, Dubai…You know what they
wanna do there? They wanna build glass skyscrapers, to be like New York.
The architects tell them they’re crazy. A glass building in a climate
like that, they’ll have to run the air conditioning twenty-four hours a
day. It’ll cost a fortune. They just shrug. So what? They’re sitting on
top of all the fuel in the world.”</p>
<p>Ruskin chuckled. “I’ll tell you what I mean about making decisions.
You remember the Energy Crisis, back in the early 1970s? That was what
they called it, the Energy Crisis. That was the best thing that ever
happened to me. All of a sudden everybody was talking about the Middle
East and the Arabs. One night I was having dinner with Willi Nordhoff,
and he gets on the subject of the Muslim religion, Islam, and how every
Muslim wants to go to Mecca before he dies. ‘Efry focking Muslim vants
to go dere.’ He always threw a lot of fockings in, because he thought
that made him sound fluent in English. Well, as soon as he said that, a
lightbulb went on over my head. Just like that. Now I was almost sixty
years old, and I was absolutely broke. The stock market had gone to hell
about then, and that was all I had done for twenty years, buy and sell
securities. I had an apartment on Park Avenue, a house on Eaton Square
in London, and a farm in Amenia, New York, but I was broke, and I was
desperate, and this lightbulb went on over my head.</p>
<p>“So I says to Willi, ‘Willi,’ I says, ‘how many Muslims are there?’
And he says, ‘I dunt know. Dere’s millions, tense of millions, hundruts
of millions.’ So I made my decision right then and there. ‘I’m going in
the air-charter business. Efry focking Arab who wants to go to Mecca,
I’m gonna take him there.’ So I sold the house in London and I sold the
farm in Amenia, to raise some cash, and I leased my first airplanes,
three worn-out Electras. All my goddamned wife could think of—I’m
talking about my former wife—was where were we gonna go in the summer,
if we couldn’t go to Amenia and we couldn’t go to London. That was her
entire comment on the whole goddamned situation.”</p>
<p>Ruskin swelled up to his story. He ordered some red wine, a heavy
wine that started a delicious fire in Fallow’s stomach. Fallow ordered a
dish called veal Boogie Woogie, which turned out to be rectangles of
veal, small squares of spiced red apples, and lines of puréed walnuts
arranged to look like Piet Mondrian’s painting Broadway Boogie Woogie.
Ruskin ordered médallions de selle d’agneau Mikado, which was perfectly
pink ovals of leg of lamb with tiny leaves of spinach and sticks of
braised celery arranged to resemble a Japanese fan. Ruskin managed to
down two glasses of the fiery red wine with a rapidity that was
startling, given the fact that he did not stop talking.</p>
<p>It seemed that Ruskin had taken many of the early flights to Mecca
himself, posing as a crewman. Arab travel agents had roamed the remotest
villages, inveigling the natives to squeeze the price of an airplane
ticket out of their pitiful possessions in order to make the magical
pilgrimage to Mecca that took a few hours rather than thirty or forty
days. Many of them had never laid eyes on an airplane. They arrived at
the airports with live lambs, sheep, goats, and chickens. No power on
earth could make them part with their animals before boarding the
aircraft. They realized the flights were short, but what were they
supposed to do for food once they got to Mecca? So the livestock went
right into the cabins with their owners, bleating, cackling, urinating,
defecating at will. Sheets of plastic were put in the cabins, covering
the seats and the floors. So man and beast traveled to Mecca shank to
flank, flying nomads on a plastic desert. Some of the passengers
immediately set about arranging sticks and brush in the aisles to build
fires to prepare dinner. One of the most urgent tasks of the crewmen was
discouraging this practice.</p>
<p>“But what I wanna tell you about is the time we went off the runway
at Mecca,” said Ruskin. “It’s nighttime and we come in for a landing,
and the pilot lands long and the goddamned ship goes off the runway and
we hit the sand with a helluva jolt and the right wing tip digs into the
sand and the plane skids around practically 360 degrees before we come
to a stop. Well, Jesus Christ, we figure there’s gonna be wholesale
panic with all these Arabs and the sheep and the goats and the chickens.
We figure it’s gonna be bloody murder. Instead, they’re all talking in
normal voices and staring out the window at the wing and the little fire
that’s started on the tip. Well, I mean, we’re the ones who are
panicked. Then they’re getting up, taking their sweet time about it, and
gathering up all their bags and sacks and animals and whatnot and just
waiting for us to open the doors. They’re so cool—and we’re scared to
death! Then it dawns on us. They think it’s normal. Yeah! They think
that’s the way you stop an airplane! You stick a wing in the sand and
spin around, and that brings the thing to a stop, and you get off! The
thing is, they never rode in an airplane before, and so whadda they know
from landing an airplane! They think it’s normal! They think that’s the
way you do it!”</p>
<p>The thought threw Ruskin into a great phlegmy laugh, deep in his
throat, and then the laugh turned into a coughing spasm, and his face
became very red. He pushed himself back from the table with his hands
until he seemed to be pressed back against the banquette, and he said,
“Unnnh! Hmmmm! Hmmmmm, hmmmmm, hmmmm,” as if he were reflecting in an
amused way on the scene he had just described. His head fell forward, as
if he were deep in thought about it all. Then his head fell sideways,
and a snoring sound came from his mouth, and he leaned his shoulder
against Fallow’s. For an instant, Fallow thought the old man had fallen
asleep. Fallow turned, in order to look into Ruskin’s face, and when he
did, Ruskin’s body fell toward him. Startled, Fallow twisted about in
his seat, and Ruskin’s head ended up on his lap. The old man’s face was
no longer red. Now it was a ghastly gray. The mouth was slightly open.
The breath was coming out in rapid little heaves. Without thinking,
Fallow tried to sit him back up on the banquette. It was like trying to
lift a sack of fertilizer. As he grappled and tugged, Fallow could see
the two women and two men at the next table, along the banquette,
staring with the contemptuous curiosity of people watching something
distasteful. No one lifted a finger, of course. Fallow now had Ruskin
propped up against the banquette and was looking around the room for
help. Raphael, a waiter, two captains, and a busboy were fussing with
the big round table that awaited Madame Tacaya and her party.</p>
<p>Fallow called out, “Excuse me!” Nobody heard him. He was conscious of
how silly it sounded, this British Excuse me, when what he meant was
Help! So he said, “Waiter!” He said it as belligerently as he could. One
of the captains by Madame Tacaya’s table looked up and frowned, then
walked over.</p>
<p>With one arm Fallow kept Ruskin upright. With the other hand he
gestured toward his face. Ruskin’s mouth was half open, and his eyes
were half closed.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ruskin’s suffered some sort of—I don’t know what!” Fallow said
to the captain.</p>
<p>The captain looked at Ruskin the way he might have looked at a pigeon
that had unaccountably walked into the restaurant and taken the best
seat in the house. He turned around and fetched Raphael, and Raphael
peered at Ruskin.</p>
<p>“What happened?” he asked Fallow.</p>
<p>“He’s suffered some sort of attack!” said Fallow. “Is there anyone
here who’s a doctor?”</p>
<p>Raphael scanned the room. But you could tell he wasn’t looking for
anyone in particular. He was trying to calculate what would happen if he
tried to quiet the room and appeal for medical assistance. He looked at
his watch and swore under his breath.</p>
<p>“For God’s sake, get a doctor!” said Fallow. “Call the police!” He
gestured with both his hands, and when he took the one hand off Ruskin,
the old man pitched face forward into his plate, into the selle d’agneau
Mikado. The woman at the next table went, “Aaaaooooooh!” Almost a yelp
it was, and she lifted her napkin to her face. The space between the two
tables was no more than six inches, and somehow Ruskin’s arm had become
wedged in.</p>
<p>Raphael barked at the captain and the two waiters at Madame Tacaya’s
table. The waiters began pulling the table away from the banquette.
Ruskin’s weight was on the table, however, and his body began to slide
forward. Fallow grabbed him around the waist to try to keep him from
hitting the floor. But Ruskin’s massive body was a dead weight. His face
was slipping off the plate. Fallow couldn’t hold him back. The old man
slid off the table and took a header onto the carpet underneath. Now he
was lying on the floor on his side, with his legs jackknifed. The
waiters pulled the table out farther, until it blocked the aisle between
the tables at the banquette and Madame Tacaya’s table. Raphael was
yelling to everybody at once. Fallow knew some French, but he couldn’t
make out a word Raphael was saying. Two waiters carrying trays full of
food stood there looking down and then at Raphael. It was a traffic jam.
Taking charge, Raphael squatted down and tried to pick Ruskin up by the
shoulders. He couldn’t budge him. Fallow stood up. Ruskin’s body
prevented him from getting out from behind the table. One look at
Ruskin’s face and it was obvious he was a goner. His face was an ashy
gray, smeared with a French sauce and pieces of spinach and celery. The
flesh around his nose and mouth was turning blue. His still-open eyes
were like two pieces of milk glass. People were craning this way and
that, but the joint was still roaring with conversation. Raphael kept
looking toward the door.</p>
<p>“For God’s sake,” said Fallow, “call a doctor.”</p>
<p>Raphael gave him a furious look and then a dismissing wave of the
hand. Fallow was startled. Then he was angry. He didn’t want to be stuck
with this dying old man, either, but now he had been insulted by this
arrogant little maître d’. So now he was Ruskin’s ally. He knelt down on
the floor, straddling Ruskin’s legs. He loosened Ruskin’s necktie and
tore open his shirt, popping off the top button. He unbuckled his belt
and unzipped the trousers and tried to pull Ruskin’s shirt away from his
body, but it was wrapped around it tightly, apparently from the way he
had fallen.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with him? ’S’e choking? ’S’e choking? Lemme g’im the
Heimlich maneuver!”</p>
<p>Fallow looked up. A big florid man, a great Percheron Yank, was
standing over him. He was apparently another diner.</p>
<p>“I think he’s had a heart attack,” said Fallow.</p>
<p>“ ’S’what it looks like when they’re choking!” said the man. “Good
God, g’im the Heimlich maneuver!”</p>
<p>Raphael had his hands up, trying to steer the man away. The man
brushed him aside and knelt down beside Ruskin.</p>
<p>“The Heimlich maneuver, damn it!” he said to Fallow. “Heimlich
maneuver!” It sounded like a military command. He put his hands under
Ruskin’s arms and managed to lift him to a sitting position, whereupon
he slipped his arms around Ruskin’s chest, from behind. He squeezed
Ruskin’s body, then lost his balance, and both he and Ruskin keeled over
onto the floor. It looked as if they were wrestling. Fallow was still on
his knees. The Heimlich Maneuverer stood up, holding his nose, which was
bleeding, and staggered away. His struggling had succeeded mainly in
pulling Ruskin’s shirt and undershirt loose from his body, so that now a
large expanse of the old man’s ponderous gut was exposed to the view of
one and all.</p>
<p>Fallow started to stand up, when he felt a heavy pressure on his
shoulder. It was the woman on the banquette trying to squeeze past. He
looked up at her face. It was a picture of frozen panic. She was shoving
Fallow as if she were trying to catch the last train out of Barcelona.
She accidentally stepped on Ruskin’s arm. She looked down. “Aaaaaaoooh!”
Another yelp. She took two steps beyond. Then she looked up at the
ceiling. She began turning slowly. There was a blur of action in front
of Fallow’s eyes. It was Raphael. He lunged toward Madame Tacaya’s
table, grabbed a chair, and slipped it under the woman at the precise
moment she fainted and collapsed. All at once she was sitting down,
comatose, with one arm hanging over the back of the chair.</p>
<p>Fallow stood up and stepped over Ruskin’s body and stood between
Ruskin and the table that awaited Madame Tacaya. Ruskin’s body was
stretched out across the aisle, like some enormous beached white whale.
Raphael stood two feet away, talking to the Asian bodyguard with the
cord in his ear. Both looked toward the door. Fallow could hear them
saying Madame Tacaya Madame Tacaya Madame Tacaya.</p>
<p>The little bastard! “What are you going to do?” Fallow demanded.</p>
<p>“Monsieur,” said Raphael angrily, “we have call the police. The
ambulance will arrive. There is nothing more I can do. There is nothing
more you can do.”</p>
<p>He gestured to a waiter, who stepped over the body, carrying a huge
tray, and began serving a table a few feet away. Fallow looked at the
faces at the tables all around. They stared at the appalling spectacle,
but they did nothing. A large old man was lying on the floor in very bad
condition. Perhaps he was dying. Certainly any of them who managed to
get a look at his face could tell that much. At first they had been
curious. Is he going to die right in front of us? At first there had
been the titillation of Someone Else’s Disaster. But now the drama was
dragging on too long. The conversational roar had died down. The old man
looked repulsive, with his pants unzipped and his big gross bare belly
bulging out. He had become a problem of protocol. If an old man was
dying on the carpet a few feet from your table, what was the proper
thing to do? Offer your services? But there was already a traffic jam
there in the aisle between the rows of tables. Clear the area and give
him air and come back later to complete the meal? But how would empty
tables help the man? Stop eating until the drama had played itself out
and the old man was out of sight? But the orders were in, and the food
had begun to arrive, and there was no sign of any halt—and this meal was
costing about 50 per person, once you added in the cost of the wine, and
it was no mean trick getting a seat in a restaurant like this in the
first place. Avert your eyes? Well, perhaps that was the only solution.
So they averted their eyes and returned to their picturesque dishes…but
there was something damned depressing about it all, because it was hard
for your eyes not to wander every few seconds to see if, f’r Chrissake,
they hadn’t moved the stricken hulk. A man dying! O mortality! Probably
a heart attack, too! That deep fear lodged in the bosom of practically
every man in the room. The old arteries were clogging up micromillimeter
by micromillimeter, day by day, month by month, from all the succulent
meats and sauces and fluffy breads and wines and soufflés and coffee…And
was that the way it would look? Would you be lying on the floor in some
public place with a blue circle around your mouth and cloudy eyes that
were half open and a hundred percent dead? It was a damned unappetizing
spectacle. It made you queasy. It prevented you from relishing these
expensive morsels arranged in such pretty pictures on your plate. So
curiosity had turned to discomfort, which now turned to resentment—an
emotion that had been picked up by the restaurateurs and doubled and
then doubled again.</p>
<p>Raphael put his hands on his hips and looked down at the old man with
a frustration bordering on anger. Fallow had the impression that had
Ruskin so much as fluttered an eyelid, the little maître d’ would have
launched into a lecture laced with the bitter-cold courtesy in which the
breed couched its insults. The roar was building up again. The diners
finally were managing to forget the corpse. But not Raphael. Madame
Tacaya was coming. The waiters were now skipping over the corpse
mindlessly, as if they did it every night, as if every night there were
one corpse or another lying in that spot, until the rhythm of the leap
was built into one’s nervous system. But how could the Empress of
Indonesia be ushered in over this hulk? Or even be seated in its
presence? What was keeping the police?</p>
<p>Gruesome bloody childish Yanks, thought Fallow. Not one of them,
other than the ridiculous Heimlich Maneuverer, had moved a muscle to
help this poor old bastard. Finally, a policeman and two crewmen from an
emergency squad arrived. The noise dipped once more as everyone
inspected the crewmen, one of whom was black and the other Latin, and
their equipment, which consisted of a folding stretcher and an oxygen
tank. They put an oxygen mask over Ruskin’s mouth. Fallow could tell
from the way the crewmen were talking to each other that they were
getting no response from Ruskin. They unfolded the stretcher and slipped
it under Ruskin’s body and strapped him on.</p>
<p>When they took the stretcher to the front door, a disturbing problem
arose. There was no way they could get the stretcher through the
revolving door. Now that the stretcher was no longer folded but was
extended with a body on it, it was too long. They began trying to fold
back one of the wings of the door, but no one seemed to know how to do
it. Raphael kept saying, “Stand it up! Stand it up! Walk it through!”
But apparently this was a grave breach of medical procedure, tilting the
body vertically, in the case of a heart-attack victim, and the crewmen
had their own necks to look after. So they all stood there in the
vestibule, before the statue of The Silver Boar, having a
discussion.</p>
<p>Raphael began throwing his hands up in the air and stamping his feet.
“Do you think I allow this”—he gestured at Ruskin’s body, paused, then
gave up on supplying an appropriate noun—“to remain here in the
restaurant, before tout le monde? Please! See for yourself! This is the
main entrance! This is a business! People are coming here! Madame Tacaya
will be here at any moment!”</p>
<p>The policeman said, “Okay, take it easy. Is there any other way
out?”</p>
<p>Much discussion. A waiter mentioned the ladies’ room, which had a
window onto the street. The policeman and Raphael went back into the
dining room to check out that possibility. Soon they returned, and the
policeman said, “Okay, I think we can make it.” So now Raphael, his
captain, the policeman, the stretcher-bearers, a waiter, Fallow, and the
inert hulk of Arthur Ruskin reentered the dining room. They headed along
the very same aisle, between the banquette tables and Madame Tacaya’s
table, where Ruskin had trod triumphantly barely an hour before. He was
still the cynosure of the procession, although he was now laid out cold.
The roar in the room dropped off sharply. The diners couldn’t believe
what they were seeing. Ruskin’s stricken face and white gut were now
being paraded by their very tables…the grim remains of the joys of the
flesh. It was as if some plague, which they all thought had been
eradicated at last, had sprung back up in their midst, more virulent
than ever.</p>
<p>The procession entered a little door on the far side of the dining
room. The door led into a small vestibule, off which were two more
doors, to the men’s room and the ladies’ room. The ladies’ room had a
small lounge area, and in it was the window to the street. After a
considerable struggle, a waiter and the policeman managed to open the
window. Raphael produced a set of keys and unlocked the hinged bars that
protected the window from the street. A cool sooty draft blew in. It was
welcome. The pileup of human beings, the quick and the dead, had made
the little room unbearable.</p>
<p>The policeman and one of the crewmen climbed through the window out
onto the sidewalk. The other crewman and the waiter passed one end of
the stretcher, the end where Ruskin’s face lay, growing grimmer and
grayer by the minute, through the window to the two men outside. The
last Fallow saw of the mortal remains of Arthur Ruskin, ferry captain to
Mecca for the Arabs, were the soles of his bench-made English shoes
disappearing through the window of the ladies’ room of La Boue
d’Argent.</p>
<p>In the next instant Raphael bolted past Fallow, out of the ladies’
room and back into the dining room. Fallow followed. Halfway across the
dining room, Fallow was intercepted by the captain who had been in
charge of his table. He gave Fallow the sort of solemn smile you give
someone in the hour of bereavement. “Monsieur,” he said, still smiling
in this sad but kindly way, and he gave Fallow a slip of paper. It
looked like a bill.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“L’addition, monsieur. The check.”</p>
<p>“The check?”</p>
<p>“Oui, naturellement. You ordered dinner, monsieur, and it was
prepared and served. We are very sorry about your friend’s misfortune…”
Then he shrugged and tucked his chin down and pulled a face. (But it has
nothing to do with us, and life goes on, and we must make a living all
the same.)</p>
<p>Fallow was shocked by the crassness of the demand. Far more shocking,
however, was the thought of having to pay a check in a restaurant like
this.</p>
<p>“If you’re so bloody keen on l’addition,” he said, “I expect you
ought to talk it over with Mr. Ruskin.” He brushed by the captain and
headed for the door.</p>
<p>“No, you don’t!” said the captain. It was no longer the oily voice of
a restaurant captain. “Raphael!” he yelled, and then he said something
in French. In the vestibule, Raphael wheeled about and confronted
Fallow. He had a very stern look on his face.</p>
<p>“Just a moment, monsieur!”</p>
<p>Fallow was speechless. But at that moment Raphael turned back toward
the door and broke into a professional smile. A big glum flat-faced
Asian in a business suit came in through the revolving door, his eyes
darting this way and that. Behind him appeared a small olive-skinned
woman, about fifty, with dark red lips and a huge carapace of black hair
and a long red silk mandarin-collared coat with a floor-length red silk
gown beneath it. She wore enough jewelry to light up the night.</p>
<p>“Madame Tacaya!” said Raphael. He held up both hands, as if catching
a bouquet.</p>
<p>The next day the front page of The City Light consisted mainly of
four gigantic words, in the biggest type Fallow had ever seen on a
newspaper:</p>
<p>Death</p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>Style</p>
<p>And above that, in smaller letters: society restaurant to tycoon:
“KINDLY FINISH DYING BEFORE MADAME TACAYA ARRIVES.”</p>
<p>And at the bottom of the page: A CITY LIGHT Exclusive by our man at
the table: Peter Fallow.</p>
<p>In addition to the main story, which recounted the evening in lavish
detail, down to the waiters skipping busily over the body of Arthur
Ruskin, there was a side story that attracted almost as much attention.
The headline read:</p>
<p>Dead Tycoon’s Secret:</p>
<p>Kosher 747s To Mecca</p>
<p>By noon the fury of the Muslim world was chattering in over the
Reuters wire in the corner of the Mouse’s office. The Mouse smiled and
rubbed his hands. The interview with Ruskin had been his idea.</p>
<p>He hummed to himself with a joy that all the money in the world
couldn’t have brought him: “Oh, I am a member of the working press, I am
a member of the working press, I am a member of the worrrrrrking
press.”</p>
