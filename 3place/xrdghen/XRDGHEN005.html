<h4 id="king-of-the-jungle">4. King of the Jungle</h4>
<p>Thumpathumpathumpathumpathumpathumpathumpa—the noise of the airliners
taking off pounded down so hard, he could feel it. The air was full of
jet fumes. The stench cut straight through to his stomach. Cars kept
popping up from out of the mouth of a ramp and threading their way
through the swarms of people who were roaming about on the roof in the
dusk looking for the elevators or their cars or other people’s
cars—steal! steal! steal!—and his would be the leading candidate,
wouldn’t it? Sherman stood with one hand resting on the door, wondering
if he dared leave it here. The car was a black Mercedes two-seat sports
roadster that had cost 8,000—or 20,000, according to how you wanted to
look at it. In a Master of the Universe tax bracket, with federal, New
York State, and New York City taxes to pay, Sherman had to make 20,000
in order to have 8,000 left to spend on a two-seat sports roadster. How
would he explain it to Judy if the thing were stolen from up here on the
roof of a terminal at Kennedy Airport?</p>
<p>Well—why would he even owe her an explanation? For a solid week he
had had dinner at home every night. It must have been the first time he
had managed that since he started working for Pierce andandandand
Pierce. He had been attentive to Campbell, spending upward of forty-five
minutes with her one evening, which was unusual, although he would have
been surprised and offended if anybody had ever pointed that out. He had
rewired a floor lamp in the library without any undue fuming and
sighing. After three days of his model performance, Judy had given up
the daybed in the dressing room and come back to the bedroom. True, the
Berlin Wall now ran down the center of the bed, and she wouldn’t give
him an inch of small talk. But she was always civil to him when Campbell
was around. That was the most important thing.</p>
<p>Two hours ago when he had called Judy to say he would be working
late, she had taken it in stride. Well—he deserved it! He took one last
look at the Mercedes and headed for the international arrivals area.</p>
<p>It was down in the bowels of the building, in what must have been
designed as a baggage area originally. Strips of fluorescent lights
struggled against the gloominess of the space. People were jammed behind
a metal fence, waiting for passengers coming in from abroad to emerge
from Customs. Suppose there was someone here who knew him and Judy? He
surveyed the crowd. Shorts, sneakers, jeans, football jerseys—Christ,
who were these people? One by one the travelers were straggling out of
Customs. Sweat suits, T-shirts, windbreakers, tube socks, overalls,
warm-up jackets, baseball caps, and tank tops; just in from Rome, Milan,
Paris, Brussels, Munich, and London; the world travelers; the
cosmopolites; Sherman lifted his Yale chin against the tide.</p>
<p>When Maria finally appeared, she wasn’t hard to spot. In this mob she
looked like something from another galaxy. She was wearing a skirt and a
big-shouldered jacket of a royal blue that was fashionable in France, a
blue-and-white-striped silk blouse, and electric-blue lizard pumps with
white calf caps on the toes. The price of the blouse and the shoes alone
would have paid for the clothes on the backs of any twenty women on the
floor. She walked with a nose-up sprocket-hipped model-girl gait
calculated to provoke maximum envy and resentment. People were staring.
Beside her marched a porter with an aluminum dolly cart heaped with
luggage, a prodigious amount of it, a matched set, cream-colored leather
with chocolate leather trim on the edges. Vulgar, but not as vulgar as
Louis Vuitton, thought Sherman. She had only gone to Italy for a week,
to find a house on Lake Como for the summer. He couldn’t imagine why she
had taken so many bags. (Unconsciously he associated such things with a
slack upbringing.) He wondered how he was going to get it all in the
Mercedes.</p>
<p>He made his way around the fence and strode toward her. He squared
his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Hello, babe,” he said.</p>
<p>“Babe?” said Maria. She added a smile, as if she weren’t really
annoyed, but obviously she was. It was true that he had never called her
babe before. He had wanted to sound confident but casual, like a Master
of the Universe meeting his girlfriend in an airport.</p>
<p>He took her arm and fell in step with her and decided to try again.
“How was the flight?”</p>
<p>“It was great,” said Maria, “if you don’t mind being bowed by some
Brit for six hours.” It was a couple of beats before Sherman realized
she was saying bored. She gazed into the distance, as if reflecting upon
her ordeal.</p>
<p>Up on the roof, the Mercedes had survived the thieving multitudes.
The skycap couldn’t get much of the luggage into the car’s sporty little
trunk. He had to stack half of it up on the back seat, which wasn’t much
more than an upholstered ledge. Terrific, thought Sherman. If I have to
stop short, I’ll get hit in the base of the skull by matched flying
cream-colored vanity cases with chocolate-brown trim.</p>
<p>By the time they got out of the airport and went onto the Van Wyck
Expressway toward Manhattan, only the last low dull glow of daylight was
visible behind the buildings and the trees of South Ozone Park. It was
that hour of dusk when the streetlights and headlights come on but make
little difference. A stream of red taillights rolled on ahead of them.
Over on the side of the expressway, just past Rockaway Boulevard, he saw
an enormous two-door sedan, the sort of car they used to make in the
1970s, up against a stone retaining wall. A man…spread-eagled on the
highway!…No, as they drew closer, he could see it wasn’t a man at all.
It was the hood of the car. The entire hood had been pulled off and was
lying on the pavement. The wheels, seats, and steering wheel were
gone…This huge derelict machine was now part of the landscape…Sherman,
Maria, the luggage, and the Mercedes rolled on.</p>
<p>He tried once more. “Well, how was Milan? What’s going on at Lake
Como?”</p>
<p>“Sherman, who’s Christopher Marlowe?” Shuhmun, who’s Christuphuh
Muhlowe?</p>
<p>Christopher Marlowe? “I don’t know. Do I know him?”</p>
<p>“The one I’m talking about was a writer.”</p>
<p>“You don’t mean the playwright?”</p>
<p>“I guess so. Who was he?” Maria continued to look straight ahead. She
sounded as if her last friend had died.</p>
<p>“Christopher Marlowe…He was a British playwright, about the time of
Shakespeare, I think. Maybe a little before Shakespeare. Why?”</p>
<p>“Which was when?” She couldn’t have sounded more miserable.</p>
<p>“Let’s see. I don’t know…The sixteenth century—15-something.
Why?”</p>
<p>“What did he write?”</p>
<p>“God…beats me. Listen, I thought I was doing well just to remember
who he was. Why?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you do know who he was.”</p>
<p>“Barely. Why?”</p>
<p>“What about Dr. Faustus?”</p>
<p>“Dr. Faustus?”</p>
<p>“Did he write something about Dr. Faustus?”</p>
<p>“Mmmmmmrnm.” A tiny flash of memory; but it slipped away. “Could be.
Dr. Faustus…The Jew of Malta! He wrote a play called The Jew of Malta.
I’m pretty sure of that. The Jew of Malta. I don’t even know how I
remember The Jew of Malta. I’m sure I never read it.”</p>
<p>“But you do know who he was. That’s one of the things you’re supposed
to know, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>And there she had put her finger on it. The only thing that had truly
stuck in Sherman’s mind about Christopher Marlowe, after nine years at
Buckley, four years at St. Paul’s, and four years at Yale, was that you
were, in fact, supposed to know who Christopher Marlowe was. But he
wasn’t about to say that.</p>
<p>Instead, he asked: “Who’s supposed to?”</p>
<p>“Anybody,” Maria mumbled. “Me.”</p>
<p>It was getting darker. The Mercedes’s spiffy dials and gauges were
now lit up like a fighter plane’s. They were nearing the Atlantic Avenue
overpass. There was another abandoned car by the side of the road. The
wheels were gone, the hood was up, and two figures, one holding a
flashlight, were jackknifed over the engine well.</p>
<p>Maria continued to look straight ahead as they merged with the
traffic on Grand Central Parkway. A galaxy of streaming headlights and
taillights filled their field of vision, as if the energy of the city
were now transformed into millions of globes of light orbiting in the
darkness. Here, inside the Mercedes, with the windows rolled up, the
entire stupendous show came gliding by without a sound.</p>
<p>“You know something, Sherman?” You know somethun, Shuhmun? “I hate
the Brits. I hate ’um.”</p>
<p>“You hate Christopher Marlowe?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, smartie,” said Maria. “You sound just like the
sonofabitch I sat next to.”</p>
<p>Now she was looking at Sherman and smiling. It was the kind of smile
you bring up bravely through great pain. Her eyes looked as if they
might be about to spring tears.</p>
<p>“Which sonofabitch?” he said.</p>
<p>“On the plane. This Brit.” Synonymous with worm. “He started talking
to me. I was looking at the catalogue from the Reiner Fetting show I saw
in Milano”—it annoyed Sherman that she used the Italian, Milano, instead
of the English, Milan, especially since he had never heard of Reiner
Fetting—“and he starts talking about Reiner Fetting. He had one a those
gold Rolexes, those huge things? It’s a wonder you can lift your arm?”
She had the Southern Girl habit of turning declarative sentences into
questions.</p>
<p>“You think he was making a play?”</p>
<p>Maria smiled, this time with pleasure. “Of course he was!”</p>
<p>The smile brought Sherman great relief. The spell was broken. Just
why, he didn’t know. He didn’t realize that there were women who thought
about sexual attractiveness the way he thought about the bond market. He
only knew that the spell had been broken and that the weight had been
lifted. It didn’t really matter what she chattered on about now. And she
did chatter on. She headed deep into the indignity she had suffered.</p>
<p>“He couldn’t wait to tell me he was a movie producer. He was making a
movie based on this play, Doctor Faustus, by Christopher Marlowe, or
just Marlowe, I think that was all he said, just Marlowe, and I don’t
even know why I said anything, but I thought somebody named Marlowe
wrote for the movies. Actually, what I think I was thinking about was,
there was this movie with a character named Marlowe. Robert Mitchum was
in it.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. It was a Raymond Chandler story.”</p>
<p>Maria looked at him with utter blankness. He dropped Raymond
Chandler. “So what did you say to him?”</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Oh, Christopher Marlowe. Didn’t he write a movie?’ And you
know what this…bastard…says to me? He says, ‘I shouldn’t think so. He
died in 1593.’ I shouldn’t think so.”</p>
<p>Her eyes were blazing with the recollection. Sherman waited a moment.
“That’s it?”</p>
<p>“That’s it? I wanted to strangle him. It was…humiliating. I shouldn’t
think so. I couldn’t believe the…snottiness.”</p>
<p>“What did you say to him?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. I turned red. I couldn’t say a word.”</p>
<p>“And that’s what accounts for this mood of yours?”</p>
<p>“Sherman, tell me the honest truth. If you don’t know who Christopher
Marlowe is, does that make you stupid?”</p>
<p>“Oh, for God’s sake, Maria. I can’t believe that’s what put you in
such a mood.”</p>
<p>“What mood?”</p>
<p>“This black cloud you landed in.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t answer me, Sherman. Does that make you stupid?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous. I could barely think of who he was, and I
probably had him in a course or something.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s just the point. At least you had him in a course. I
didn’t have him in any course. That’s what makes me feel so—you don’t
even understand what I’m talking about, do you?”</p>
<p>“I sure don’t.” He smiled at her, and she smiled back.</p>
<p>By now they were passing La Guardia Airport, which was lit up by
hundreds of sodium vapor lights. It didn’t look like a great gateway to
the sky. It looked like a factory. Sherman swung to the outside and hit
the accelerator and sent the Mercedes barreling under the Thirty-first
Street overpass and up the ramp onto the Triborough Bridge. The cloud
had passed. He was feeling pleased with himself once again. He had
jollied her out of it.</p>
<p>Now he had to slow down. All four lanes were heavy with traffic. As
the Mercedes ascended the bridge’s great arc, he could see the island of
Manhattan off to the left. The towers were jammed together so tightly,
he could feel the mass and stupendous weight. Just think of the
millions, from all over the globe, who yearned to be on that island, in
those towers, in those narrow streets! There it was, the Rome, the
Paris, the London of the twentieth century, the city of ambition, the
dense magnetic rock, the irresistible destination of all those who
insist on being where things are happening—and he was among the victors!
He lived on Park Avenue, the street of dreams! He worked on Wall Street,
fifty floors up, for the legendary Pierce andandandand Pierce,
overlooking the world! He was at the wheel of a 8,000 roadster with one
of the most beautiful women in New York—no Comp. Lit. scholar, perhaps,
but gorgeous—beside him! A frisky young animal! He was of that breed
whose natural destiny it was…to have what they wanted!</p>
<p>He took one hand off the wheel and made a grand gesture toward the
mighty island.</p>
<p>“There it is, babe!”</p>
<p>“We’re back to babe again?”</p>
<p>“I just feel like calling you babe, babe. New York City. There it
is.”</p>
<p>“Do you really think I’m the babe type?”</p>
<p>“You’re as babe as they come, Maria. Where do you want to have
dinner? It’s all yours. New York City.”</p>
<p>“Sherman! Aren’t you supposed to turn there?”</p>
<p>He looked to the right. It was true. He was two lanes to the left of
the lanes that led to the off-ramp to Manhattan, and there was no way he
could cut across. By now this lane—the next lane—the next lane—every
lane—was a train of cars and trucks, bumper to bumper, inching toward a
toll plaza a hundred yards ahead. Above the plaza was a huge green sign,
lit up by yellow lamps, saying BRONX UPSTATE N.Y. NEW ENGLAND.</p>
<p>“Sherman, I’m sure that’s the turnoff to Manhattan.”</p>
<p>“You’re right, sweetheart, but there’s no way I can get over there
now.”</p>
<p>“Where does this go?”</p>
<p>“The Bronx.”</p>
<p>The trains of vehicles inched forward in a cloud of carbon and
sulphur particles toward the toll gates.</p>
<p>The Mercedes was so low-slung, Sherman had to reach way up to
surrender two dollar bills at the booth. A tired-looking black man
stared down at him from the window of a very high perch. Something had
made a long gash in the side of the booth. The gully was corroding.</p>
<p>A vague smoky abysmal uneasiness was seeping into Sherman’s skull.
The Bronx…He had been born and raised in New York and took a manly pride
in knowing the city. I know the city. But in fact his familiarity with
the Bronx, over the course of his thirty-eight years, was derived from
five or six trips to the Bronx Zoo, two to the Botanical Gardens, and
perhaps a dozen trips to Yankee Stadium, the last one in 1977 for a
World Series game. He did know that the Bronx had numbered streets,
which were a continuation of Manhattan’s. What he would do would
be—well, he would get on a cross street and take that west until he
reached one of the avenues that take you back down into Manhattan. How
bad could it be?</p>
<p>The tide of red taillights flowed on ahead of them, and now they
bothered him. In the darkness, amid this red swarm, he couldn’t get his
bearings. His sense of direction was slipping away. He must be heading
north still. The down side of the bridge hadn’t curved a great deal. But
now there were only signs to go by. His entire stock of landmarks was
gone, left behind. At the end of the bridge the expressway split into a
Y. MAJOR DEEGAN GEO. WASHINGTON BRIDGE…BRUCKNER…NEW ENGLAND…Major Deegan
went upstate…No!…Veer right…Suddenly another Y…EAST BRONX NEW
ENGLAND…EAST 138 BRUCKNER BOULEVARD…Choose one, you
ninny!…Acey-deucey…one finger, two fingers…He veered right again…EAST
138th…a ramp…All at once there was no more ramp, no more clean cordoned
expressway. He was at ground level. It was as if he had fallen into a
junkyard. He seemed to be underneath the expressway. In the blackness he
could make out a cyclone fence over on the left…something caught in it…A
woman’s head!…No, it was a chair with three legs and a burnt seat with
the charred stuffing hanging out in great wads, rammed halfway through a
cyclone fence…Who on earth would jam a chair into the mesh of a cyclone
fence? And why?</p>
<p>“Where are we, Sherman?”</p>
<p>He could tell by the tone of her voice that there weren’t going to be
any more discussions of Christopher Marlowe or where to have dinner.</p>
<p>“We’re in the Bronx.”</p>
<p>“You know how to get outta here?”</p>
<p>“Sure. If I can just find a cross street…Let’s see, let’s see, let’s
see…138th Street…”</p>
<p>They were traveling north underneath the expressway. But what
expressway? Two lanes, both heading north…To the left a retaining wall
and cyclone fencing and concrete columns supporting the
expressway…Should head west to find a street back to Manhattan…turn
left…but he can’t turn left because of the wall…Let’s see, let’s
see…138th Street…Where is it?…There! The sign—138th Street…He keeps to
the left, to make the turn…A big opening in the wall…138th Street…But he
can’t turn left! To his left are four or five lanes of traffic, down
here underneath the expressway, two going north, two going south, and
another one beyond them, cars and trucks barreling in both
directions—there’s no way he can cut across that traffic…So he keeps
going…into the Bronx…Another opening in the wall coming up…He hugs the
left lane…Same situation!…No way to turn left!…He begins to feel trapped
here in the gloom beneath the expressway…But how bad could it be?…Plenty
of traffic…</p>
<p>“What are we doing, Sherman?”</p>
<p>“I’m trying to turn left, but there’s no way you can turn left off of
this goddamned road. I’m going to have to turn right somewhere up here
and make a U-turn or something and come back across.”</p>
<p>Maria had no comment. Sherman glanced at her. She was looking
straight ahead, grimly. Off to the right, above some low decrepit
buildings, he could see a billboard that said</p>
<p>Tops In The Bronx</p>
<p>Meat Warehouse</p>
<p>Meat warehouse…deep in the Bronx…Another opening in the wall up
ahead…He starts bearing to the right this time—a tremendous horn!—a
truck passing him on the right…He swerves left—</p>
<p>“Sherman!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, babe.”</p>
<p>—too late to make the right turn…He keeps going, hugs the right side
of the right lane, ready for the turn…Another opening…turns right…a wide
street…What a lot of people all of a sudden…Half of them seem to be out
in the street…dark, but they look Latin…Puerto Ricans?…Over there a long
low building with scalloped dormer windows…like something from a
storybook Swiss chalet…but terribly blackened…Over here a bar—he
stares—half covered in metal shutters…So many people in the street…He
slows down…Low apartment buildings with windows missing…entire sashes
gone…A red light. He stops. He can see Maria’s head panning this way and
that…“Ooooooaaaggggh!” A tremendous scream off to the left…A young man
with a wispy mustache and a sport shirt is sauntering across the street.
A girl runs after him screaming. “Ooooooaggggh!”…Dark face, frizzy blond
hair…She throws her arm around his neck, but in slow motion, as if she’s
drunk. “Ooooooaaggggh!” Trying to strangle him! He doesn’t even look at
her. He just rams his elbow back into her stomach. She slides off his
body. She’s down on the street on all fours. He keeps walking. Never
looks back. She gets up. She lunges toward him again. “Ooooaagggh!” Now
they’re right in front of the car. Sherman and Maria are sitting in
their tan leather bucket seats staring right at them. The girl—she has
her man by the neck again. He gives her another whack in the midsection
with his elbow. The light changes, but Sherman can’t budge. People have
come out into the street from both sides to watch the imbroglio. They’re
laughing. They’re cheering. She’s pulling his hair. He’s grimacing and
whacking her backward with both elbows. People all over the place.
Sherman looks at Maria. Neither has to say a word. Two white people, one
of them a young woman decked out in a royal-blue Avenue Foch jacket with
shoulders out to here…enough matched luggage in the back seat for a trip
to China…a 8,000 Mercedes roadster…in the middle of the South
Bronx…Miraculous! No one pays any attention to them. Just another car at
the light. The two combatants gradually edge off to the other side of
the street. Now they’re grappling like Sumo wrestlers, face to face.
They’re staggering, weaving. They’re worn out. They’re gasping for
breath. They’ve had it. They might as well be dancing. The crowd’s
losing interest, drifting away.</p>
<p>Sherman says to Maria, “True love, babe.” Wants to make her think
he’s not worried.</p>
<p>Now there’s no one in front of the car, but the light has turned red
again. He waits it out, then heads down the street. Not so many people
now…a wide street. He makes a U-turn, heads back the way they came…</p>
<p>“What are you gonna do now, Sherman?”</p>
<p>“I think we’re okay. This is a main cross street. We’re heading in
the right direction. We’re heading west.”</p>
<p>But when they crossed the big thoroughfare under the expressway, they
found themselves in a chaotic intersection. Streets converged from odd
angles…People were crossing the street in every direction…Dark
faces…Over this way a subway entrance…Over there low buildings,
shops…Great Taste Chinese Takeout…He couldn’t tell which street went due
west…That one—the likeliest—he turned that way…a wide street…cars parked
on both sides…up ahead, double-parked…triple-parked…a crowd…Could he
even get through?…So he turned…that way…There was a street sign, but the
names of the streets were no longer parallel to the streets themselves.
East Something seemed to be…in that direction…So he took that street,
but it quickly merged with a narrow side street and ran between some low
buildings. The buildings appeared to be abandoned. At the next corner he
turned—west, he figured—and followed that street a few blocks. There
were more low buildings. They might have been garages and they might
have been sheds. There were fences with spirals of razor wire on top.
The streets were deserted, which was okay, he told himself, and yet he
could feel his heart beating with a nervous twang. Then he turned again.
A narrow street lined with seven- or eight-story apartment buildings; no
sign of people; not a light in a window. The next block, the same. He
turned again, and as he rounded the corner—</p>
<p>—astonishing. Utterly empty, a vast open terrain. Block after
block—how many?—six? eight? a dozen?—entire blocks of the city without a
building left standing. There were streets and curbing and sidewalks and
light poles and nothing else. The eerie grid of a city was spread out
before him, lit by the chemical yellow of the street lamps. Here and
there were traces of rubble and slag. The earth looked like concrete,
except that it rolled down this way…and up that way…the hills and dales
of the Bronx…reduced to asphalt, concrete, and cinders…in a ghastly
yellow gloaming.</p>
<p>He had to look twice to make sure he was in fact still driving on a
New York street. The street led up a long slope…Two blocks away…three
blocks away…it was hard to tell on this enormous vacant lot…There was a
lone building, the last one…It was on the corner…three or four stories
high…It looked as if it were ready to keel over at any moment…It was lit
up at the ground level, as if there was a store or a bar…Three or four
people were out on the sidewalk. Sherman could see them under the
streetlight on the corner.</p>
<p>“What is this, Sherman?” Maria was staring right at him.</p>
<p>“The southeast Bronx, I guess.”</p>
<p>“You mean you don’t know where we are?”</p>
<p>“I know about where we are. As long as we keep heading west we’ll be
all right.”</p>
<p>“What makes you think we’re heading west?”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry, we’re heading west. It’s just, uh…”</p>
<p>“It’s just what?”</p>
<p>“If you see a street sign…I’m looking for a numbered street.”</p>
<p>The truth was, Sherman could no longer tell which way he was heading.
As they drew near the building, he could hear thung thung thung thung
thung thung. He could hear it even though the windows of the car were
up…A bass violin…An electrical cord looped down from the light pole on
the corner through the open door. Out on the sidewalk was a woman
wearing what looked like a basketball jersey and shorts, and two men in
short-sleeved sport shirts. The woman was leaning over with her hands on
her knees, laughing and swinging her head around in a big circle. The
two men were laughing at her. Were they Puerto Rican? There was no
telling. Inside the doorway, the doorway where the electrical cord went,
Sherman could see a low light and silhouettes. Thung thung thung thung
thung…the bass…then the tops of some trumpet notes…Latin music?…The
woman’s head went around and around.</p>
<p>He glanced at Maria. She sat there in her terrific royal-blue jacket.
Her thick dark bobbed hair framed a face that was as frozen as a
photograph. Sherman sped up and left the eerie outpost in the
wasteland.</p>
<p>He turned toward some buildings…over there…He passed houses with no
sashes in the windows…</p>
<p>They came upon a little park with an iron railing around it. You had
to turn either left or right. The streets went off at odd angles.
Sherman had lost track of the grid pattern altogether. It no longer
looked like New York. It looked like some small decaying New England
city. He turned left.</p>
<p>“Sherman, I’m beginning not to like this.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, kid.”</p>
<p>“It’s kid now?”</p>
<p>“You didn’t like babe.” He wanted to sound nonchalant.</p>
<p>Now there were cars parked along the street…Three youths stood
beneath a streetlight; three dark faces. They wore quilted jackets. They
stared at the Mercedes. Sherman turned again.</p>
<p>Up ahead he could see the fuzzy yellow glow of what seemed to be a
wider, more brightly lit street. The closer they came to it, the more
people…on the sidewalks, in doorways, out in the street…What a lot of
dark faces…Up ahead, something in the street. His headlights were soaked
up by the darkness. Then he could make it out. A car parked out in the
middle of the street, nowhere near the curb…a group of boys standing
around it…More dark faces…Could he even get around them? He pushed the
button that locked the doors. The electronic click startled him, as if
it were the beat of a snare drum. He eased by. The boys stooped down and
stared in the windows of the Mercedes.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of his eye he could see one of them smiling. But he
said nothing. He just stared and grinned. Thank God, there was enough
room. Sherman kept easing on by. Suppose he had a flat tire? Or the
engine flooded? That would be a pretty fix. But he didn’t feel rattled.
He was still on top of it. Just keep rolling. That’s the main thing. A
8,000 Mercedes. Come on, you Krauts, you Panzer heads, you
steely-brained machinists…Do it right…He made it past the car. Up ahead,
a thoroughfare…Traffic was going across the intersection at a good clip
in both directions. He let his breath out. He’d take it! To the right!
To the left! It didn’t matter. He reached the intersection. The light
was red. Well, the hell with that. He started through.</p>
<p>“Sherman, you’re going through a red light!”</p>
<p>“Good. Maybe the cops’ll come. That wouldn’t upset me too much.”</p>
<p>Maria wasn’t saying a word. The concerns of her luxurious life were
now tightly focused. Human existence had but one purpose: to get out of
the Bronx.</p>
<p>Up ahead the vaporous mustard glow of the streetlights was brighter
and more spread out…Some sort of major intersection…Wait a second…Up
there, a subway entrance…Over here, shops, cheap food joints…Texas Fried
Chicken…Great Taste Chinese Takeout…Great Taste Chinese Takeout!</p>
<p>Maria was thinking the same thing. “Jesus Christ, Sherman, we’re back
where we started! You been around in a circle!”</p>
<p>“I know it. I know it. Just hold on a second. I tell you what. I’m
gonna take a right. I’m gonna head back down under the expressway. I’m
gonna—”</p>
<p>“Don’t get under that thing again, Sherman.”</p>
<p>The expressway was right up above. The light was green. Sherman
didn’t know what to do. Someone was blowing a horn behind him.</p>
<p>“Sherman! Look over there! It says George Washington Bridge!”</p>
<p>Where? The horn kept blowing. Then he saw it. It was on the far side,
beneath the expressway, in the decrepit gray gloaming, a sign on a
concrete support…95. 895 EAST. GEO. WASH. BRIDGE…Must be a ramp…</p>
<p>“But we don’t want to go in that direction! That’s north!”</p>
<p>“So what, Sherman? At least you know what it is! At least it’s
civilization! Let’s get outta here!”</p>
<p>The horn blared. Somebody was back there yelling. Sherman gunned it,
while he still had the light. He drove across the five lanes toward the
little sign. He was back under the expressway.</p>
<p>“It’s right over there, Sherman!”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay, I see it.”</p>
<p>The ramp looked like a black chute stuck up between the concrete
supports. The Mercedes took a hard bounce from a pothole.</p>
<p>“Christ,” said Sherman, “I didn’t even see that.”</p>
<p>He leaned forward over the steering wheel. The headlights shot across
the concrete columns in a delirium. He shifted into second gear. He
turned left around an abutment and gunned it up the ramp. Bodies!…Bodies
in the road!…Two of them curled up!…No, not bodies…ridges in the
side…molds…No, containers, some kind of containers…Trash cans…He’d have
to squeeze to the left to get around them…He shifted down into first
gear and turned to the left…A blur in his headlights…For an instant he
thought someone had jumped off the guardrail of the ramp…Not big
enough…It was an animal…It was lying in the road, blocking the
way…Sherman jammed down on the brake…A piece of luggage hit him in the
back of his head…two pieces…</p>
<p>A shriek from Maria. A suitcase was on top of her headrest. The car
had stalled. Sherman set the brake and pulled the suitcase off her and
shoved it back.</p>
<p>“You okay?”</p>
<p>She wasn’t looking at him. She was staring through the windshield.
“What is that?”</p>
<p>Blocking the road—it wasn’t an animal…Treads…It was a wheel…His first
thought was that a wheel had come off a car up on the expressway and it
had bounced down here onto the ramp. All at once the car was dead quiet,
because the engine had stalled out. Sherman started the engine up again.
He tested the brake to make sure it was secure. Then he opened the
door.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, Sherman?”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna push it out of the way.”</p>
<p>“Be careful. What if a car’s coming?”</p>
<p>“Well.” He shrugged and got out.</p>
<p>He felt strange from the moment he set foot on the ramp. From
overhead the tremendous clanging noise of vehicles going over some sort
of metal joint or plate in the expressway. He was staring up at the
expressway’s black underbelly. He couldn’t see the cars. He could only
hear them pounding the road, apparently at great speed, making the
clanging noise and creating a field of vibration. The vibration
enveloped the great corroded black structure with a hum. But at the same
time he could hear his shoes, his 50 New andandandand Lingwood shoes,
New andandandand Lingwood of Jermyn Street, London, with their English
leather soles and heels, making tiny gritty scraping sounds as he walked
up the incline toward the wheel. The tiny gritty scraping sound of his
shoes was as sharp as any sound he had ever heard. He leaned over. It
wasn’t a wheel, after all, only a tire. Imagine a car losing a tire. He
picked it up.</p>
<p>“Sherman!”</p>
<p>He turned around, toward the Mercedes. Two figures!…Two young
men—black—on the ramp, coming up behind him…Boston Celtics!…The one
nearest him had on a silvery basketball warm-up jacket with CELTICS
written across the chest…He was no more than four or five steps
away…powerfully built…His jacket was open…a white T-shirt…tremendous
chest muscles…a square face…wide jaws…a wide mouth…What was that
look?…Hunter! Predator!…The youth stared Sherman right in the
eye…walking slowly…The other one was tall but skinny, with a long neck,
a narrow face…a delicate face…eyes wide open…startled…He looked
terrified…He wore a big loose sweater…He was a step or two behind the
big one…</p>
<p>“Yo!” said the big one. “Need some help?”</p>
<p>Sherman stood there, holding the tire and staring.</p>
<p>“What happen, man? Need some help?”</p>
<p>It was a neighborly voice. Setting me up! One hand inside his jacket
pocket! But he sounds sincere. It’s a setup, you idiot! But suppose he
merely wants to help? What are they doing on this ramp! Haven’t done
anything—haven’t threatened. But they will! Just be nice. Are you
insane? Do something! Act! A sound filled his skull, the sound of
rushing steam. He held the tire up in front of his chest. Now! Bango—he
charged at the big one and shoved the tire at him. It was coming right
back at him! The tire was coming right back at him! He threw his arms
up. It bounced off his arms. A sprawl—the brute fell over the tire.
Silvery CELTICS jacket—on the pavement. Sherman’s own momentum carried
him forward. He skidded on the New andandandand Lingwood party shoes. He
pivoted.</p>
<p>“Sherman!”</p>
<p>Maria was behind the wheel of the car. The engine was roaring. The
door on the passenger side was open.</p>
<p>“Get in!”</p>
<p>The other one, the skinny one, was between him and the car…a
terrified look on his mug…eyes wide open…Sherman was pure frenzy…Had to
get to the car!…He ran for it. He lowered his head. He crashed into him.
The boy went spinning back and hit the rear fender of the car but didn’t
fall down.</p>
<p>“Henry!”</p>
<p>The big one was getting up. Sherman threw himself into the car.</p>
<p>Maria’s ghastly stricken face: “Get in! Get in!”</p>
<p>The roaring engine…the Panzer-head Mercedes dials…A blur outside the
car…Sherman grabbed the door pull and with a tremendous adrenal burst
banged it shut. Out of the corner of his eye, the big one—almost to the
door on Maria’s side. Sherman hit the lock mechanism. Rap! He was
yanking on the door handle—CELTICS inches from Maria’s head with only
the glass in between. Maria shoved the Mercedes into first gear and
squealed forward. The youth leaped to one side. The car was heading
straight for the trash cans. Maria hit the brakes. Sherman was thrown
against the dash. A vanity case landed on top of the gearshift. Sherman
pulled it off. Now it was on his lap. Maria threw the car into reverse.
It shot backward. He glanced to his right. The skinny one…The skinny boy
was standing there staring at him…pure fear on his delicate face…Maria
shoved it into first gear again…She was breathing in huge gulps, as if
she were drowning…</p>
<p>Sherman yelled, “Look out!”</p>
<p>The big one was coming toward the car. He had the tire up over his
head. Maria squealed the car forward, right at him. He lurched out of
the way…a blur…a terrific jolt…The tire hit the windshield and bounced
off, without breaking the glass…The Krauts!…Maria cut the wheel to the
left, to keep from hitting the cans…The skinny one standing right
there…The rear end fishtailed…thok!…The skinny boy was no longer
standing…Maria fought the steering wheel…A clear shot between the
guardrail and the trash cans…She floored it…A furious squeal…The
Mercedes shot up the ramp…The road rose beneath him…Sherman hung on…The
huge tongue of the expressway…Lights rocketing by…Maria braked the
car…Sherman and the vanity case were thrown up against the
dashboard…Hahhh hahhhhh hahhhhh hahhhhh…At first he thought she was
laughing. She was only trying to get her breath.</p>
<p>“You okay?”</p>
<p>She gunned the car forward. The blare of a horn—</p>
<p>“For Christ’s sake, Maria!”</p>
<p>The blaring horn swerved and hurtled past, and they were out on the
expressway.</p>
<p>His eyes were stinging with perspiration. He took one hand off the
vanity case to rub his eyes, but it started shaking so badly he put it
back on the case. He could feel his heart beating in his throat. He was
soaking wet. His jacket was coming apart. He could feel it. It was
ripped in the back seams. His lungs were struggling for more oxygen.</p>
<p>They were barreling along the expressway, much too fast.</p>
<p>“Slow down, Maria! Jesus Christ!”</p>
<p>“Where’s it go, Sherman? Where’s it go?”</p>
<p>“Just follow the signs that say George Washington Bridge, and for
Christ’s sake, slow down.”</p>
<p>Maria took one hand off the steering wheel to push back her hair from
her forehead. Her entire arm, as well as her hand, was shaking. Sherman
wondered if she could control the car, but he didn’t want to break her
concentration. His heart was racing along with hollow thuds, as if it
had broken loose inside his rib cage.</p>
<p>“Aw shit, my arms are shaking!” said Maria. Aw shit, muh uhms uh
shakin’. He had never heard her use the word shit before.</p>
<p>“Just take it easy,” said Sherman. “We’re okay now, we’re okay.”</p>
<p>“But where’s it go!”</p>
<p>“Just take it easy! Just follow the signs. George Washington
Bridge.”</p>
<p>“Aw shit, Sherman, that’s what we did before!”</p>
<p>“Take it easy, for Christ’s sake. I’ll tell you where.”</p>
<p>“Don’t fuck up this time, Sherman.”</p>
<p>Sherman found his hands gripping the vanity case in his lap as if it
were a second wheel. He tried to concentrate on the road ahead. Then he
stared at a sign over the highway up ahead: CROSS BRONX GEO. WASH.
BRIDGE.</p>
<p>“Cross Bronx! What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Just take it!”</p>
<p>“Shit, Sherman!”</p>
<p>“Stay on the highway. We’re okay.” The navigator.</p>
<p>He stared at the white line on the roadbed. He stared so hard, they
began separating on him…the lines…the signs…the taillights…He couldn’t
figure out the pattern any longer…He was concentrating
on…fragments!…molecules!…atoms!…Jesus Christ!…I’ve lost the power to
reason!…His heart went into palpitations…and then a big…snap!…it went
back into a regular rhythm…</p>
<p>Then, overhead: MAJOR DEEGAN TRIBORO BRIDGE.</p>
<p>“See that, Maria? Triborough Bridge! Take that!”</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ, Sherman, George Washington Bridge!”</p>
<p>“No! We want the Triborough, Maria! That’ll take us right back into
Manhattan!”</p>
<p>So they took that expressway. Presently, overhead: WILLIS AVE.</p>
<p>“What’s Willis Avenue?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s the Bronx,” said Sherman.</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>“Just stay to your left! We’re okay!”</p>
<p>“Shit, Sherman!”</p>
<p>Over the highway a big sign: TRIBORO.</p>
<p>“There it is, Maria! You see that!”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Bear to your right up there. You exit to the right!” Now Sherman was
gripping the vanity case and giving it the body English for a right
turn. He was holding a vanity case and giving it body English. Maria had
on an Avenue Foch royal-blue jacket with shoulder pads…out to here…a
tense little animal writhing under royal-blue shoulder pads from
Paris…the two of them in a 8,000 Mercedes with spiffy airplane
dials…desperate to escape the Bronx…</p>
<p>They reached the exit. He held on for dear life, as if a tornado were
going to rise up at any moment and blow them out of the proper groove
and—back to the Bronx!</p>
<p>They made it. Now they were on the long incline that led to the
bridge and to Manhattan.</p>
<p>Hahhhhh hahhhhhh hahhhhhh hahhhhh. “Sherman!”</p>
<p>He stared at her. She was sighing and taking in huge gulps of
air.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“Sherman, he threw it…right at me!”</p>
<p>“Threw what?”</p>
<p>“That…wheel, Sherman!”</p>
<p>The tire had hit the windshield right in front of her eyes. But
something else flashed into Sherman’s mind…thok!…the sound of the rear
fender hitting something and the skinny boy disappearing from view…Maria
let out a sob.</p>
<p>“Get a grip on yourself! We’ve only got a little farther!”</p>
<p>She snuffled back her tears. “God…”</p>
<p>Sherman reached over and massaged the back of her neck with his left
hand.</p>
<p>“You’re okay, honey. You’re doing swell.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Sherman.”</p>
<p>The odd thing was—and it struck him as odd in that very moment—he
wanted to smile. I saved her! I am her protector! He kept rubbing her
neck.</p>
<p>“It was only a tire,” said the protector, savoring the luxury of
calming the weak. “Otherwise it would’ve broken the windshield.”</p>
<p>“He threw it…right…at me.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know. It’s okay. It’s all over.”</p>
<p>But he could hear it again. The little thok. And the skinny boy was
gone.</p>
<p>“Maria, I think you—I think we hit one of them.”</p>
<p>You—we—already a deep instinct was summoning up the clammy patriarch,
blame.</p>
<p>Maria didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“You know when we skidded. There was this kind of a…this kind of
a…little sound, a little thok.”</p>
<p>Maria remained silent. Sherman was staring at her. Finally she said,
“Yeah—I—I don’t know. I don’t give a shit, Sherman. All I care is, we
got outta there.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s the main thing, but—”</p>
<p>“Oh, God, Sherman, like—the worst nightmare!” She started choking
back sobs, all the while hunched forward and staring straight ahead,
through the windshield, concentrating on the traffic.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, sweetheart. We’re okay now.” He rubbed her neck some
more. The skinny boy was standing there. Thok. He wasn’t standing there
anymore.</p>
<p>The traffic was getting heavier. The tide of red taillights ahead of
them ran under an overpass and turned up an incline. They weren’t far
from the bridge. Maria slowed down. In the darkness, the toll plaza was
a great smear of concrete turned yellowish by the lights above. Out
front, the red lights became a swarm closing in on the tollbooths. In
the distance Sherman could see the dense black of Manhattan.</p>
<p>Such gravity…so many lights…so many people…so many souls sharing this
yellow smear of concrete with him…and all of them oblivious of what he
had just been through!</p>
<p>Sherman waited until they were rolling down the FDR Drive, along the
East River, back in White Manhattan and Maria was calmer, before he
brought the subject up again.</p>
<p>“Well, what do you think, Maria? I guess we ought to report this to
the police.”</p>
<p>She didn’t say anything. He looked at her. She stared grimly at the
roadway.</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>“What for?”</p>
<p>“Well, I just think—”</p>
<p>“Sherman, shut up.” She said it softly, gently. “Just let me drive
this goddamn car.”</p>
<p>The familiar 1920s Gothic palisades of New York Hospital were just up
ahead. White Manhattan! They took the Seventy-first Street exit off the
drive.</p>
<p>Maria parked across the street from the town house and her
fourth-floor hideaway. Sherman got out and immediately scrutinized the
right rear fender. To his great relief—no dent; no sign of anything, at
least not here in the dark. Since Maria had told her husband she
wouldn’t be returning from Italy until the next day, she wanted to take
the luggage up to the little apartment, too. Three times Sherman climbed
up the creaking staircase, in the miserable gloaming of the Landlord’s
Halos, hauling up the luggage.</p>
<p>Maria took off her royal-blue jacket with the Paris shoulders and put
it on the bed. Sherman took off his jacket. It was badly ripped in the
back, in the side seams. Huntsman, Savile Row, London. Cost a goddamned
fortune. He threw it on the bed. His shirt was wringing wet. Maria
kicked off her shoes and sat down in one of the bentwood chairs by the
oak pedestal table and put one elbow on the table and let her head keel
over against her forearm. The old table sagged in its sad way. Then she
straightened up and looked at Sherman.</p>
<p>“I want a drink,” she said. “You want one?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. You want me to fix them?”</p>
<p>“Unh-hunh. I want a lot of vodka and a little orange juice and some
ice. The vodka’s up in the cabinet.”</p>
<p>He went in the mean little kitchen and turned on the light. A
cockroach was sitting on the rim of a dirty frying pan on the stove.
Well, the hell with it. He made Maria her vodka-and-orange juice and
then poured himself an Old Fashioned glass full of scotch and put in
some ice and a little water. He sat in one of the bentwood chairs across
the table from her. He found that he wanted the drink very badly. He
longed for each ice-cold burning jolt in his stomach. The car
fishtailed. Thok. The tall delicate one wasn’t standing there any
longer.</p>
<p>Maria had already drunk half the big tumbler he had brought her. She
closed her eyes and threw her head back and then looked at Sherman and
smiled in a tired fashion. “I swear,” she said, “I thought that was
gonna be…it.”</p>
<p>“Well, what do we do now?” said Sherman.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I guess we oughta—I guess we oughta report it to the police.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you said. Okay. Tell me what for.”</p>
<p>“Well, they tried to rob us—and I think maybe you—I think it’s
possible you hit one of them.”</p>
<p>She just looked at him.</p>
<p>“It was when you really gunned it, and we skidded.”</p>
<p>“Well, you wanna know something? I hope I did. But if I did, I sure
didn’t hit him very hard. I just barely heard something.”</p>
<p>“It was just a little thok. And then he wasn’t standing there
anymore.”</p>
<p>Maria shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Well—I’m just thinking out loud,” said Sherman. “I think we ought to
report it. That way we protect ourselves.”</p>
<p>Maria expelled air through her lips, the way you do when you’re at
your wit’s end, and looked away.</p>
<p>“Well, just suppose the guy is hurt.”</p>
<p>She looked at him and laughed softly. “Frankly, I couldn’t care
less.”</p>
<p>“But just suppose—”</p>
<p>“Look, we got outta there. How we did it doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>“But suppose—”</p>
<p>“Suppose bullshit, Sherman. Where you gonna go to tell the police?
What are you gonna say?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’ll just tell them what happened.”</p>
<p>“Sherman, I’m gonna tell you what happened. I’m from South Carolina,
and I’m gonna tell you in plain English. Two niggers tried to kill us,
and we got away. Two niggers tried to kill us in the jungle, and we got
outta the jungle, and we’re still breathing, and that’s that.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but suppose—”</p>
<p>“You suppose! Suppose you go to the police. What are you gonna say?
What are you gonna say we were doing in the Bronx? You say you’re just
gonna tell them what happened. Well, you tell me, Sherman. What
happened?”</p>
<p>So that was what she was actually saying. Do you tell the police that
Mrs. Arthur Ruskin of Fifth Avenue and Mr. Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue
happened to be having a nocturnal tête-à-tête when they missed the
Manhattan off-ramp from the Triborough Bridge and got into a little
scrape in the Bronx? He ran that through his mind. Well, he could just
tell Judy—no, there was no way he could just tell Judy about a little
ride with a woman named Maria. But if they—if Maria had hit the boy,
then it was better to grit his teeth and just tell what happened. Which
was what? Well…two boys had tried to rob them. They blocked the roadway.
They approached him. They said…A little shock went through his solar
plexus. Yo! You need some help? That was all the big one had said. He
hadn’t produced a weapon. Neither of them had made a threatening gesture
until after he had thrown the tire. Could it be—now, wait a minute.
That’s crazy. What else were they doing out on a ramp to an expressway
beside a blockade, in the dark—except to—Maria would back up his
interpretation—interpretation!—a frisky wild animal—all of a sudden he
realized that he barely knew her.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “Maybe you’re right. Let’s think about it.
I’m only thinking out loud.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have to think about it, Sherman. Some things I understand
better than you do. Not many things, but some things. They’d love to get
their hands on you and me.”</p>
<p>“Who would?”</p>
<p>“The police. And what good would it do, anyway? They’ll never catch
those boys.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, get their hands on us?”</p>
<p>“Please, forget the police.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“You, for a start. You’re a socialite.”</p>
<p>“I am not a socialite.” Masters of the Universe existed on a plateau
far above socialites.</p>
<p>“Oh no? Your apartment was in Architectural Digest. Your picture’s
been in W. Your father was—is—well, whatever he is. You know.”</p>
<p>“My wife put the apartment in the magazine!”</p>
<p>“Well, you can explain that to the police, Sherman. I’m sure they’ll
appreciate the distinction.”</p>
<p>Sherman was speechless. It was a hateful thought.</p>
<p>“And they won’t half mind getting holda me, either, as far as that
goes. I’m just a little girl from South Carolina, but my husband has a
hundred million dollars and an apartment on Fifth Avenue.”</p>
<p>“All right, I’m just trying to figure out the sequence, the things
that might come up, that’s all. What if you did hit the boy—what if he’s
injured?”</p>
<p>“Did you see him get hit?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Neither did I. As far as I’m concerned, I didn’t hit anybody. I hope
to God I did, but as far as I’m concerned, and as far as you’re
concerned, I didn’t hit anybody. Okay?”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess you’re right. I didn’t see anything. But I heard
something, and I felt something.”</p>
<p>“Sherman, it all happened so fast, you don’t know what happened, and
neither do I. Those boys aren’t going to the police. You can be
goddamned sure a that. And if you go to the police, they won’t find
them, either. They’ll just have a good time with your story—and you
don’t know what happened, do you?”</p>
<p>“I guess I don’t.”</p>
<p>“I guess you don’t, either. If the question ever comes up, all that
happened was, two boys blocked the road and tried to rob us, and we got
away from them. Period. That’s all we know.”</p>
<p>“And why didn’t we report it?”</p>
<p>“Because it was pointless. We weren’t hurt, and we figured they’d
never find those boys, anyway. And you know something, Sherman?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“That happens to be the whole truth. You can imagine anything you
want, but that happens to be all you know and all I know.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. You’re right. I don’t know, I’d just feel better if—”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to feel better, Sherman. I was the one who was
driving. If I hit the sonofabitch, then it was me who hit him—and I’m
saying I didn’t hit anybody, and I’m not reporting anything to the
police. So just don’t you worry about it.”</p>
<p>“I’m not worrying about it, it’s just that—”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>Sherman hesitated. Well, that was true, wasn’t it? She was driving.
It was his car, but she took it upon herself to drive it, and if the
question ever came up, whatever happened was her responsibility. She was
driving…and so if there was anything to report, that was her
responsibility, too. Naturally, he would stick by her…but already a
great weight was sliding off his back.</p>
<p>“You’re right, Maria. It was like something in the jungle.” He nodded
several times, to indicate that the truth had finally dawned on him.</p>
<p>Maria said, “We coulda been killed, right there, just as easy as
not.”</p>
<p>“You know something, Maria? We fought.”</p>
<p>“Fought?”</p>
<p>“We were in the goddamned jungle…and we were attacked…and we fought
our way out.” Now he sounded as if the dawn were breaking wider and
wider. “Christ, I don’t know when the last time was I was in a fight, an
actual fight. Maybe I was twelve, thirteen. You know something, babe?
You were great. You were fantastic. You really were. When I saw you
behind the wheel—I didn’t even know if you could drive the car!” He was
elated. She was driving. “But you drove the hell out of it! You were
great!” Oh, the dawn had broken. The world glowed with its radiance.</p>
<p>“I don’t even remember what I did,” said Maria. “It was just
a—a—everything happened at once. The worst part was getting over into
the seat. I don’t know why they put that gearshift thing in the middle
there. I caught my skirt on it.”</p>
<p>“When I saw you there, I couldn’t believe it! If you hadn’t done
that”—he shook his head—“we’d’ve never made it.”</p>
<p>Now that they were into the exultation of the war story, Sherman
couldn’t resist giving himself an opening for a little praise.</p>
<p>Maria said, “Well, I just did it on—I don’t know—instinct.” Typical
of her; she didn’t notice the opening.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Sherman, “well, it was a damned good instinct. I kind of
had my hands full at that point!” An opening big enough for a truck.</p>
<p>This one even she noticed. “Oh, Sherman—I know you did. When you
threw that wheel, that tire, at that boy—oh, God, I thought—I just
about—you beat them both, Sherman! You beat them both!”</p>
<p>I beat them both. Never had there been such music in the ears of the
Master of the Universe. Play on! Never stop!</p>
<p>“I couldn’t figure out what was happening!” said Sherman. Now he was
smiling with excitement and not even trying to hold back the smile. “I
threw the tire, and all of a sudden it was coming back in my face!”</p>
<p>“That was because he put up his hands to block it, and it bounced
off, and—”</p>
<p>They plunged into the thick adrenal details of the adventure.</p>
<p>Their voices rose, and their spirits rose, and they laughed,
supposedly over the bizarre details of the battle but actually with
sheer joy, spontaneous exultation over the miracle. Together they had
faced the worst nightmare of New York, and they had triumphed.</p>
<p>Maria sat up straight and began looking at Sherman with her eyes
extra wide and her lips parted in the suggestion of a smile. He had a
delicious premonition. Without a word she stood up and took off her
blouse. She wore nothing underneath it. He stared at her breasts, which
were glorious. The fair white flesh was gorged with concupiscence and
glistening with perspiration. She walked over to him and stood between
his legs as he sat in the chair and began untying his tie. He put his
arms around her waist and pulled her so hard she lost her balance. They
rolled down onto the rug. What a happy, awkward time they had wriggling
out of their clothes!</p>
<p>Now they were stretched out on the floor, on the rug, which was
filthy, amid the dust balls, and who cared about the dirt and the dust
balls? They were both hot and wet with perspiration, and who cared about
that, either? It was better that way. They had been through the wall of
fire together. They had fought in the jungle together, hadn’t they? They
were lying side by side, and their bodies were still hot from the fray.
Sherman kissed her on the lips, and they lay like that for a long time,
just kissing, with their bodies pressed together. Then he ran his
fingers over her back and the perfect curve of her hip and the perfect
curve of her thigh and the perfect inside of her thigh—and never before
such excitement! The rush ran straight from his fingertips to his groin
and then throughout his nervous system to a billion explosive synaptic
cells. He wanted to have this woman literally, to enclose her in his
very hide, to subsume this hot fair white body of hers, in the prime of
youth’s sweet rude firm animal health, and make it his forever. Perfect
love! Pure bliss! Priapus, king and master! Master of the Universe! King
of the Jungle!</p>
<p>Sherman kept both his cars, the Mercedes and a big Mercury station
wagon, in an underground garage two blocks from his apartment house. At
the bottom of the ramp he stopped, as always, beside the wooden
cashier’s hut. A chubby little man in a short-sleeved sport shirt and
baggy gray twill pants came out the door. It was the one he disliked,
Dan, the redheaded one. He got out of the car and quickly rolled up his
jacket, hoping the little attendant wouldn’t see it was torn.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sherm! Howya doin’?”</p>
<p>That was what Sherman truly detested. It was bad enough that this man
insisted on calling him by his first name. But to shorten it to Sherm,
which no one had ever called him—that was escalating presumptuousness
into obnoxiousness. Sherman could think of nothing he had ever said, no
gesture he had ever made, that had given him the invitation or even the
opening to become familiar. Gratuitous familiarity was not the sort of
thing you were supposed to mind these days, but Sherman minded it. It
was a form of aggression. You think I am your inferior, you Wall Street
Wasp with the Yale chin, but I will show you. Many times he had tried to
think of some polite but cold and cutting response to these hearty
pseudo-friendly greetings, and he had come up with nothing.</p>
<p>“Sherm, howawya?” Dan was right beside him. He wouldn’t let up.</p>
<p>“Fine,” Mr. McCoy said frostily…but also lamely. One of the unwritten
rules of status conduct is that when an inferior greets you with a
how-are-you, you do not answer the question. Sherman turned to walk
away.</p>
<p>“Sherm!”</p>
<p>He stopped. Dan was standing beside the Mercedes with his hands on
his chubby hips. He had hips like an old woman’s.</p>
<p>“You know your coat is ripped?”</p>
<p>The block of ice, his Yale chin jutting out, said nothing.</p>
<p>“Right there,” said Dan with considerable satisfaction. “You can see
the lining. How’d you do that?”</p>
<p>Sherman could hear it—thok—and he could feel the rear end of the car
fishtailing, and the tall skinny boy was no longer standing there. Not a
word about that—and yet he had a terrific urge to tell this odious
little man. Now that he had been through the wall of fire and survived,
he was experiencing one of man’s keenest but least understood drives:
information compulsion. He wanted to tell his war story.</p>
<p>But caution triumphed, caution bolstered by snobbery. He probably
should talk to no one about what had happened; and to this man least of
all.</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” he said.</p>
<p>“You didn’t notice it?”</p>
<p>The frosty snowman with the Yale chin, Mr. Sherman McCoy, motioned
toward the Mercedes. “I won’t be taking it out again until the weekend.”
Then he did an about-face and left.</p>
<p>As he reached the sidewalk, a puff of wind swept the street. He could
feel how damp his shirt was. His pants were still damp behind the knees.
His ripped jacket was draped over the crook of his arm. His hair felt
like a bird’s nest. He was a mess. His heart was beating a little too
fast. I have something to hide. But what was he worrying about? He
wasn’t driving the car when it happened—if it happened. Right! If it
happened. He hadn’t seen the boy get hit, and she hadn’t, either, and
besides, it was in the heat of a fight for their very lives—and she was
driving, in any case. If she didn’t want to report it, that was her
business.</p>
<p>He stopped and took a breath and looked around. Yes; White Manhattan,
the sanctuary of the East Seventies. Across the street a doorman stood
under the canopy of an apartment house, smoking a cigarette. A boy in a
dark business suit and a pretty girl in a white dress were strolling
toward him. The fellow was talking to her a mile a minute. So young, and
dressed like an old man in a Brooks Brothers or Chipp or J. Press suit,
just the way he had looked when he first went to work at Pierce
andandandand Pierce.</p>
<p>All at once a wonderful feeling swept over Sherman. For Christ’s
sake, what was he worried about? He stood there on the sidewalk,
stock-still, with his chin up and big grin on his face. The boy and girl
probably thought he was a lunatic. In fact—he was a man. Tonight, with
nothing but his hands and his nerve he had fought the elemental enemy,
the hunter, the predator, and he had prevailed. He had fought his way
out of an ambush on the nightmare terrain, and he had prevailed. He had
saved a woman. The time had come to act like a man, and he had acted and
prevailed. He was not merely a Master of the Universe; he was more; he
was a man. Grinning and humming, “Show me but ten who are stouthearted
men,” the stouthearted man, still damp from the fray, walked the two
blocks to his duplex apartment overlooking the street of dreams.</p>
