<h4 id="gibraltar">2. Gibraltar</h4>
<p>The next morning, to Lawrence Kramer, she appears, from out of a
feeble gray dawn, the girl with brown lipstick. She stands right beside
him. He can’t make out her face, but he knows she’s the girl with brown
lipstick. He can’t make out any of the words, either, the words that
tumble like tiny pearls from between those lips with brown lipstick, and
yet he knows what she’s saying. Stay with me, Larry. Lie down with me,
Larry. He wants to! He wants to! He wants nothing more in this world!
Then why doesn’t he? What holds him back from pressing his lips upon
those lips with brown lipstick? His wife, that’s what. His wife, his
wife, his wife, his wife, his wife—</p>
<p>He woke up to the pitch and roll of his wife crawling down to the
foot of the bed. What a flabby, clumsy spectacle…The problem was that
the bed, a queen-size resting on a plywood platform, was nearly the
width of the room. So you had to crawl down or otherwise traverse the
length of the mattress to reach the floor.</p>
<p>Now she was standing on the floor and bending over a chair to pick up
her bathrobe. The way her flannel nightgown came down over her hips, she
looked a mile wide. He immediately regretted thinking any such thought.
He tingled with sentiment. My Rhoda! After all, she had given birth just
three weeks ago. He was looking at the loins that had brought forth his
first child. A son! She didn’t have her old shape back yet. He had to
allow for that.</p>
<p>Still, that didn’t make the view any better.</p>
<p>He watched her wiggle into the bathrobe. She turned toward the
doorway. A light came from the living room. No doubt the baby nurse, who
was from England, Miss Efficiency, was already up and waxing efficient.
In the light he could see his wife’s pale, puffy, undecorated face in
profile.</p>
<p>Only twenty-nine, and already she looked just like her mother.</p>
<p>She was the same person all over again! She was her mother! No two
ways about it! It was only a matter of time! She had the same reddish
hair, the same freckles, the same chubby peasant nose and cheeks, even
the beginning of her mother’s double chin. A yenta in embryo! Little
Gretel of the shtetl! Young and yitzy on the Upper West Side!</p>
<p>He narrowed his eyelids to slits so that she wouldn’t know he was
awake. Then she left the room. He could hear her saying something to the
baby nurse and to the baby. She had a way of saying “Jo-shu-a” in baby
cadence. That was a name he was already beginning to regret. If you
wanted a Jewish name, what was wrong with Daniel or David or Jonathan?
He pulled the covers back up over his shoulders. He would return to the
sublime narcosis of sleep for another five or ten minutes. He would
return to the girl with brown lipstick. He closed his eyes…It was no
use. He couldn’t get her back. All he could think of was what the rush
to the subway would be like if he didn’t get up now.</p>
<p>So he got up. He walked down the mattress. It was like trying to walk
along the bottom of a rowboat, but he didn’t want to crawl. So flabby
and clumsy…He was wearing a T-shirt and B.V.D. shorts. He became aware
that he had that common affliction of young men, a morning erection. He
went to the chair and put on his old plaid bathrobe. Both he and his
wife had started wearing bathrobes since the English baby nurse had come
into their lives. One of the apartment’s many tragic flaws was that
there was no way of getting from the bedroom to the bathroom without
going through the living room, where the nurse slept on the convertible
couch and the baby resided in a crib beneath a music-box mobile hung
with tiny stuffed clowns. He could hear it now. The music box played the
tune “Send in the Clowns.” It played it over and over again. Plink plink
plinkplink, plink plink plinkplink, plink PLINK plinkplink.</p>
<p>He looked down. The bathrobe did not do the trick. It looked as if
there was a tent pole underneath it. But if he bent over, like this, it
wasn’t noticeable. So he could walk through the living room and let the
baby nurse see the tent pole, or he could walk through hunched over as
if he had a back spasm. So he just stood where he was, in the gloom.</p>
<p>The gloom was right. The presence of the baby nurse had made him and
Rhoda acutely aware of what a dump they lived in. This entire apartment,
known as a 3½-room in New York real-estate parlance, had been created
out of what had once been a pleasant but by no means huge bedroom on the
third floor of a town house, with three windows overlooking the street.
The so-called room he now stood in was really nothing more than a slot
that had been created by inserting a plasterboard wall. The slot had one
of the windows. What was left of the original room was now called a
living room, and it had the other two windows. Back by the door to the
hallway were two more slots, one for a kitchen two people couldn’t pass
each other in, and the other for a bathroom. Neither had a window. The
place was like one of those little ant colonies you can buy, but it cost
them 88 a month, rent stabilized. If it hadn’t been for the
rent-stabilization law, it would have cost probably ,500, which would be
out of the question. And they had been happy to find it! My God, there
were college graduates his age, thirty-two, all over New York who were
dying to find an apartment like this, a 3½, with a view, in a town
house, with high ceilings, rent stabilized, in the West Seventies! Truly
pathetic, wasn’t it? They could barely afford it when they were both
working and their combined salaries had been 6,000 a year, 1,000 after
deductions. The plan had been that Rhoda’s mother would give them the
money as a sort of baby present to hire a baby nurse for four weeks,
while Rhoda got back on her feet and went back to work. In the meantime,
they would find an au pair girl to live in and look after the baby in
return for room and board. Rhoda’s mother had come through with her part
of the plan, but it was already obvious that this au pair girl who was
willing to sleep on a convertible couch in the living room in an ant
colony on the West Side did not exist. Rhoda would not be able to go
back to work. They were going to have to get by on his
5,000-after-taxes, and the yearly rent here in this dump, even with the
help of rent stabilization, was 0,656.</p>
<p>Well, at least these morbid considerations had restored his bathrobe
to a decent shape. So he emerged from the bedroom.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Glenda,” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh, good morning, Mr. Kramer,” said the baby nurse.</p>
<p>Very cool and British, this voice of hers. Kramer was convinced he
really couldn’t care less about British accents or the Brits themselves.
In fact, they intimidated him, the Brits and their accents. In the baby
nurse’s oh, a mere oh, he detected a whiff of Finally getting up, are
you?</p>
<p>A plump, fiftyish woman, she was already efficiently turned out in
her white uniform. Her hair was pulled back into a perfect bun. She had
already closed up the convertible couch and put the cushions back in
place, so that it had resumed its daytime mode as a dingy yellow,
synthetic-linen-covered piece of parlor furniture. She sat on the edge
of the thing, her back perfectly straight, drinking a cup of tea. The
baby was lying on his back in his crib, perfectly content. Perfectly was
the woman’s middle name. They had found her through the Gough Agency,
which an article in the Home section of the Times had listed as one of
the best and most fashionable. So they were paying the fashionable price
of 25 a week for an English baby nurse. From time to time she mentioned
other places where she had worked. Always it was Park Avenue, Fifth
Avenue, Sutton Place…Well, too bad! Now you’re getting an eyeful of a
jack-legged walk-up on the West Side! They called her Glenda. She called
them Mr. Kramer and Mrs. Kramer, instead of Larry and Rhoda. Everything
was upside down. Glenda was the very picture of gentility, having tea,
while Mr. Kramer, lord of the ant colony, came tramping through to the
bathroom barefooted, bare-legged, tousle-headed, wearing a tattered old
plaid bathrobe. Over in the corner, under an extremely dusty Dracaena
fragrans plant, the TV set was on. A commercial flared to an end, and
some smiling heads began talking on the Today show. But the sound was
not on. She wouldn’t be so imperfect as to have the TV blaring. What on
earth was she really thinking, this British arbiter sitting in judgment
(on an appalling fold-out sofa) upon the squalor of chez Kramer?</p>
<p>As for the mistress of the household, Mrs. Kramer, she was just
emerging from the bathroom, still in her bathrobe and slippers.</p>
<p>“Larry,” she said, “look at my fuh-head. I think theh’s something
theh, like a rash. I sawr it in the mirror.”</p>
<p>Still foggy, Kramer tried to look at her fuh-head.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing, Rhoda. It’s like the beginning of a pimple.”</p>
<p>That was another thing. Since the baby nurse had arrived, Kramer had
also become acutely aware of the way his wife talked. He had never
noticed it before, or hardly. She was a graduate of New York University.
For the past four years she had been an editor at Waverly Place Books.
She was an intellectual, or at least she seemed to be reading a lot of
the poetry of John Ashbery and Gary Snyder when he first met her, and
she had a lot to say about South Africa and Nicaragua. Nevertheless, a
forehead was a fuh-head, and there had no r at the end, but saw did.</p>
<p>That was like her mother, too.</p>
<p>Rhoda padded on by, and Kramer entered the bathroom slot. The
bathroom was pure Tenement Life. There was laundry hanging all along the
shower curtain rod. There was more laundry on a line that ran diagonally
across the room, a baby’s zip-up suit, two baby bibs, some bikini
panties, several pairs of panty hose, and God knew what else, none of it
the baby nurse’s, of course. Kramer had to duck down to get to the
toilet. A wet pair of panty hose slithered over his ear. It was
revolting. There was a wet towel on the toilet seat. He looked around
for some place to hang it. There was no place. He threw it on the
floor.</p>
<p>After urinating, he moved twelve or fourteen inches to the sink and
took off his bathrobe and his T-shirt and draped them over the toilet
seat. Kramer liked to survey his face and his build in the mornings.
What with his wide, flat features, his blunt nose, his big neck, nobody
ever took him for Jewish at first. He might be Greek, Slavic, Italian,
even Irish—in any event, something tough. He wasn’t happy that he was
balding on top, but in a way that made him look tough, too. He was
balding the way a lot of professional football players were balding. And
his build…But this morning he lost heart. Those powerful deltoids, those
massive sloping trapezii, those tightly bunched pectorals, those curving
slabs of meat, his biceps—they looked deflated. He was fucking
atrophying! He hadn’t been able to work out since the baby and the baby
nurse arrived. He kept his weights in a carton behind the tub that held
the dracaena plant, and he worked out between the plant and the
couch—and there was no way in the world he could work out, could grunt
and groan and strain and ventilate and take appreciative looks at
himself in the mirror in front of the English baby nurse…or the mythical
au pair girl of the future, for that matter…Let’s face it! It’s time to
give up those childish dreams! You’re an American workadaddy now!
Nothing more.</p>
<p>When he left the bathroom, he found Rhoda sitting on the couch next
to the English baby nurse, and both of them had their eyes pinned on the
TV set, and the sound was up. It was the news segment of the Today
show.</p>
<p>Rhoda looked up and said excitedly: “Look at this, Larry! It’s the
Mayor! There was a riot in Harlem last night. Someone threw a bottle at
him!”</p>
<p>Kramer only barely noticed that she said meh-uh for mayor and boh-uhl
for bottle. Astonishing things were happening on the screen. A stage—a
melee—heaving bodies—and then a huge hand filled the screen and blotted
out everything for an instant. More screams and grimaces and thrashing
about, and then pure vertigo. To Kramer and Rhoda and the baby nurse it
was as if the rioters were breaking through the screen and jumping onto
the floor right beside little Joshua’s crib. And this was the Today
show, not the local news. This was what America was having for breakfast
this morning, a snootful of the people of Harlem rising up in their
righteous wrath and driving the white Mayor off the stage in a public
hall. There goes the back of his head right there, burrowing for cover.
Once he was the Mayor of New York City. Now he is the Mayor of White New
York.</p>
<p>When it was over, the three of them looked at one another, and
Glenda, the English baby nurse, spoke up, with considerable
agitation.</p>
<p>“Well, I think that’s perfectly disgusting. The colored don’t know
how good they’ve got it in this country, I can tell you that much. In
Britain there’s not so much as a colored in a police uniform, much less
an important public official, the way they have here. Why, there was an
article just the other day. There’s more than two hundred coloreds who
are mayors in this country. And they want to bash the Mayor of New York
about. Some people don’t know how well off they are, if you ask me.”</p>
<p>She shook her head angrily.</p>
<p>Kramer and his wife looked at each other. He could tell she was
thinking the same thing he was.</p>
<p>Thank God in heaven! What a relief! They could let their breaths out
now. Miss Efficiency was a bigot. These days the thing about bigotry
was, it was undignified. It was a sign of Low Rent origins, of inferior
social status, of poor taste. So they were the superiors of their
English baby nurse, after all. What a fucking relief.</p>
<p>The rain had just about stopped when Kramer started walking to the
subway. He was wearing an old raincoat over his usual gray suit,
button-down shirt, and necktie. He had on a pair of Nike running shoes,
white with stripes on the sides. He carried his brown leather dress
shoes in a shopping bag, one of those slippery white plastic bags you
get at the AandandandandP.</p>
<p>The subway stop where he could catch the D train to the Bronx was at
Eighty-first Street and Central Park West. He liked to walk across to
Central Park West on Seventy-seventh Street and then walk up to
Eighty-first, because that took him past the Museum of Natural History.
It was a beautiful block, the most beautiful block on the West Side, to
Kramer’s way of thinking, like a street scene in Paris; not that he had
ever been to Paris. Seventy-seventh Street was very wide at that point.
On one side was the museum, a marvelous Romanesque Revival creation in
an old reddish stone. It was set back in a little park with trees. Even
on a cloudy day like this the young spring leaves seemed to glow.
Verdant was the word that crossed his mind. On this side of the street,
where he was walking, was a cliff of elegant apartment houses
overlooking the museum. There were doormen. He got glimpses of marbled
halls. And then he thought of the girl with brown lipstick…He could see
her very clearly now, much more clearly than in the dream. He clenched
his fist. Damn it! He was going to do it! He was going to call her. He
was going to make that telephone call. He’d have to wait until the end
of the trial, of course. But he was going to do it. He was tired of
watching other people lead… The Life. The girl with brown lipstick!—the
two of them, looking into each other’s eyes across a table in one of
those restaurants with blond wood and exposed brick and hanging plants
and brass and etched glass and menus with crayfish Natchez and veal and
plantains mesquite and cornbread with cayenne pepper!</p>
<p>Kramer had that vision comfortably in place when just up ahead, from
the swell-looking doorway of 44 West Seventy-seventh Street emerged a
figure that startled him.</p>
<p>It was a young man, almost babyish in appearance, with a round face
and dark hair, neatly combed back. He was wearing a covert-cloth
Chesterfield topcoat with a golden brown velvet collar and carrying one
of those burgundy leather attaché cases that come from Mädler or T.
Anthony on Park Avenue and have a buttery smoothness that announces: “I
cost 00.” You could see part of the uniformed arm that held the door
open for him. He was walking with brisk little steps under the canopy,
across the sidewalk, toward an Audi sedan. There was a driver in the
front seat. There was a number—271—in the rear side window; a private
car service. And now the doorman was hurrying out, and the young man
paused to let him catch up and open the sedan’s rear door.</p>
<p>And this young man was…Andy Heller! No doubt about it whatsoever. He
had been in Kramer’s class at Columbia Law School—and how superior
Kramer had felt when Andy, chubby bright little Andy, had done the usual
thing, namely, gone to work Downtown, for Angstrom andandandand Molner.
Andy and hundreds like him would spend the next five or ten years humped
over their desks checking commas, document citations, and block phrases
to zip up and fortify the greed of mortgage brokers,
health-and-beauty-aid manufacturers, merger-and-acquisition arbitragers,
and re-insurance discounters—while he, Kramer, would embrace life and
wade up to his hips into the lives of the miserable and the damned and
stand up on his feet in the courtrooms and fight, mano a mano, before
the bar of justice.</p>
<p>And that was the way it had, in fact, turned out. Why, then, did
Kramer now hold back? Why didn’t he march right up and sing out, “Hi,
Andy”? He was no more than twenty feet from his old classmate. Instead,
he stopped and turned his head toward the front of the building and put
his hand to his face, as if he had something in his eye. He was damned
if he felt like having Andy Heller—while his doorman held his car door
open for him and his driver waited for the signal to depart—he was
damned if he felt like having Andy Heller look him in the face and say,
“Larry Kramer, how you doing!” and then, “What you doing?” And he would
have to say, “Well, I’m an assistant district attorney up in the Bronx.”
He wouldn’t even have to add, “Making 6,000 a year.” That was common
knowledge. All the while, Andy Heller would be scanning his dirty
raincoat, his old gray suit, which was too short in the pants, his Nike
sneakers, his AandandandandP shopping bag…Fuck that…Kramer stood there
with his head turned, faking a piece of grit in his eye, until he heard
the door of the Audi shut. It sounded like a safe closing. He turned
around just in time to catch a nice fluffy little cloud of German
luxury-auto fumes in his face as Andy Heller departed for his office.
Kramer didn’t even want to think about what the goddamned place probably
looked like.</p>
<p>On the subway, the D train, heading for the Bronx, Kramer stood in
the aisle holding on to a stainless-steel pole while the car bucked and
lurched and screamed. On the plastic bench across from him sat a bony
old man who seemed to be growing like a fungus out of a backdrop of
graffiti. He was reading a newspaper. The headline on the newspaper said
HARLEM MOB CHASES MAYOR. The words were so big, they took up the entire
page. Up above, in smaller letters, it said “Go Back Down to Hymietown!”
The old man was wearing a pair of purple-and-white-striped running
sneakers. They looked weird on such an old man, but there was nothing
really odd about them, not on the D train. Kramer scanned the floor.
Half the people in the car were wearing sneakers with splashy designs on
them and molded soles that looked like gravy boats. Young people were
wearing them, old men were wearing them, mothers with children on their
laps were wearing them, and for that matter, the children were wearing
them. This was not for reasons of Young Fit andandandand Firm Chic, the
way it was downtown, where you saw a lot of well-dressed young white
people going off to work in the morning wearing these sneakers. No, on
the D train the reason was, they were cheap. On the D train these
sneakers were like a sign around the neck reading SLUM or EL BARRIO.</p>
<p>Kramer resisted admitting to himself why he wore them. He let his
eyes drift up. There were a few people looking at the tabloids with the
headlines about the riot, but the D train to the Bronx was not a
readers’ train…No…Whatever happened in Harlem would have exactly no
effect in the Bronx. Everybody in the car was looking at the world with
the usual stroked-out look, avoiding eye contact.</p>
<p>Just then there was one of those drops in sound, one of those holes
in the roar you get when a door opens between subway cars. Into the car
came three boys, black, fifteen or sixteen years old, wearing big
sneakers with enormous laces, untied but looped precisely in parallel
lines, and black thermal jackets. Kramer braced and made a point of
looking tough and bored. He tensed his sternocleidomastoid muscles to
make his neck fan out like a wrestler’s. One on one…he could tear any
one of them apart…But it was never one on one…He saw boys like this
every day in court…Now the three of them were moving through the
aisle…They walked with a pumping gait known as the Pimp Roll…He saw the
Pimp Roll in the courtroom every day, too…On warm days in the Bronx
there were so many boys out strutting around with the Pimp Roll, whole
streets seemed to be bobbing up and down…They drew closer, with the
invariable cool blank look…Well, what could they possibly do?…They
passed on by, on either side of him…and nothing happened…Well, of course
nothing happened…An ox, a stud like him…he’d be the last person in the
world they’d choose to tangle with…Just the same, he was always glad
when the train pulled into the 161st Street station.</p>
<p>Kramer climbed the stairs and came out onto 161st Street. The sky was
clearing. Before him, right there, rose the great bowl of Yankee
Stadium. Beyond the stadium were the corroding hulks of the Bronx. Ten
or fifteen years ago they had renovated the stadium. They had spent a
hundred million dollars on it. That was supposed to lead to “the
revitalization of the heart of the Bronx.” What a grim joke! Since then,
this precinct, the 44th, these very streets, had become the worst in the
Bronx for crime. Kramer saw that every day, too.</p>
<p>He started walking up the hill, up 161st Street, in his sneakers,
carrying his AandandandandP bag with his shoes inside. The people of
these sad streets were standing outside the stores and short-order
counters along 161st.</p>
<p>He looked up—and for an instant he could see the old Bronx in all its
glory. At the top of the hill, where 161st Street crossed the Grand
Concourse, the sun had broken through and had lit up the limestone face
of the Concourse Plaza Hotel. From this distance it could still pass for
a European resort hotel from the 1920s. The Yankee ballplayers used to
live there during the season, the ones who could afford it, the stars.
He always pictured them living in big suites. Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth,
Lou Gehrig…Those were the only names he could remember, although his
father used to talk about a lot more. O golden Jewish hills of long ago!
Up there at the top of the hill, 161st Street and the Grand Concourse
had been the summit of the Jewish dream, of the new Canaan, the new
Jewish borough of New York, the Bronx! Kramer’s father had grown up
seventeen blocks from here, on 178th Street—and he had dreamed of
nothing in this world more glorious than having an apartment…someday…in
one of these grand buildings on the summit, on the Grand Concourse. They
had created the Grand Concourse as the Park Avenue of the Bronx, except
the new land of Canaan was going to do it better. The Concourse was
wider than Park Avenue, and it had been more lushly landscaped—and there
you had another grim joke. Did you want an apartment on the Concourse?
Today you could have your pick. The Grand Hotel of the Jewish dream was
now a welfare hotel, and the Bronx, the Promised Land, was 70 percent
black and Puerto Rican.</p>
<p>The poor sad Jewish Bronx! When he was twenty-two, just entering law
school, Kramer had begun to think of his father as a little Jew who over
the course of a lifetime had finally made the great Diasporic migration
from the Bronx to Oceanside, Long Island, all of twenty miles away, and
who still trundled back and forth every day to a paper-carton warehouse
in the West Twenties, in Manhattan, where he was “comptroller.” He,
Kramer, would be the lawyer…the cosmopolitan…And now, ten years later,
what had happened? He was living in an ant colony that made the old
man’s Tract Colonial three-bedroom in Oceanside look like San Simeon and
taking the D train—the D train!—to work every day in…the Bronx!</p>
<p>Right before Kramer’s eyes the sun began to light up the other great
building at the top of the hill, the building where he worked, the Bronx
County Building. The building was a prodigious limestone parthenon done
in the early thirties in the Civic Moderne style. It was nine stories
high and covered three city blocks, from 161st Street to 158th Street.
Such open-faced optimism they had, whoever dreamed up that building back
then!</p>
<p>Despite everything, the courthouse stirred his soul. Its four great
façades were absolute jubilations of sculpture and bas-relief. There
were groups of classical figures at every corner. Agriculture, Commerce,
Industry, Religion, and the Arts, Justice, Government, Law and Order,
and the Rights of Man—noble Romans wearing togas in the Bronx! Such a
golden dream of an Apollonian future!</p>
<p>Today, if one of those lovely classical lads ever came down from up
there, he wouldn’t survive long enough to make it to 162nd Street to get
a Choc-o-pop or a blue Shark. They’d whack him out just to get his toga.
It was no joke, this precinct, the 44th. On the 158th Street side the
courthouse overlooked Franz Sigel Park, which from a sixth-floor window
was a beautiful swath of English-style landscaping, a romance of trees,
bushes, grass, and rock outcroppings that stretched down the south side
of the hill. Practically nobody but him knew the name of Franz Sigel
Park anymore, however, because nobody with half a brain in his head
would ever go far enough into the park to reach the plaque that bore the
name. Just last week some poor devil was stabbed to death at 10:00 a.m.
on one of the concrete benches that had been placed in the park in 1971
in the campaign to “provide urban amenities to revitalize Franz Sigel
Park and reclaim it for the community.” The bench was ten feet inside
the park. Somebody killed the man for his portable radio, one of the big
ones known in the District Attorney’s Office as Bronx attache cases.
Nobody from the District Attorney’s Office went out into the park on a
sunny day in May to have lunch, not even somebody who could bench-press
two hundred pounds, the way he could. Not even a court officer, who had
a uniform and legally carried a .38, ever did such a thing. They stayed
inside the building, this island fortress of the Power, of the white
people, like himself, this Gibraltar in the poor sad Sargasso Sea of the
Bronx.</p>
<p>On the street he was about to cross, Walton Avenue, three
orange-and-blue Corrections Department vans were lined up, waiting to
get into the building’s service bay. The vans brought prisoners from the
Bronx House of Detention, Rikers Island, and the Bronx Criminal Court, a
block away, for appearances at Bronx County Supreme Court, the court
that handled serious felonies. The courtrooms were on the upper floors,
and the prisoners were brought into the service bay. Elevators took them
up to holding pens on the courtroom floors.</p>
<p>You couldn’t see inside the vans, because their windows were covered
by a heavy wire mesh. Kramer didn’t have to look. Inside those vans
would be the usual job lots of blacks and Latins, plus an occasional
young Italian from the Arthur Avenue neighborhood and once in a while an
Irish kid from up in Woodlawn or some stray who had the miserable luck
to pick the Bronx to get in trouble in.</p>
<p>“The chow,” Kramer said to himself. Anybody looking at him would have
actually seen his lips move as he said it.</p>
<p>In about forty-five seconds he would learn that somebody was, in
fact, looking at him. But at that moment it was nothing more than the
usual, the blue-and-orange vans and him saying to himself, “The
chow.”</p>
<p>Kramer had reached that low point in the life of an assistant
district attorney in the Bronx when he is assailed by Doubts. Every year
forty thousand people, forty thousand incompetents, dimwits, alcoholics,
psychopaths, knockabouts, good souls driven to some terrible terminal
anger, and people who could only be described as stone evil, were
arrested in the Bronx. Seven thousand of them were indicted and
arraigned, and then they entered the maw of the criminal justice
system—right here—through the gateway into Gibraltar, where the vans
were lined up. That was about 150 new cases, 150 more pumping hearts and
morose glares, every week that the courts and the Bronx County District
Attorney’s Office were open. And to what end? The same stupid, dismal,
pathetic, horrifying crimes were committed day in and day out, all the
same. What was accomplished by assistant D.A.’s, by any of them, through
all this relentless stirring of the muck? The Bronx crumbled and decayed
a little more, and a little more blood dried in the cracks. The Doubts!
One thing was accomplished for sure. The system was fed, and those vans
brought in the chow. Fifty judges, thirty-five law clerks, 245 assistant
district attorneys, one D.A.—the thought of which made Kramer twist his
lips in a smile, because no doubt Weiss was up there on the sixth floor
right now screaming at Channel 4 or 7 or 2 or 5 about the television
coverage he didn’t get yesterday and wants today—and Christ knew how
many criminal lawyers, Legal Aid lawyers, court reporters, court clerks,
court officers, correction officers, probation officers, social workers,
bail bondsmen, special investigators, case clerks, court
psychiatrists—what a vast swarm had to be fed! And every morning the
chow came in, the chow and the Doubts.</p>
<p>Kramer had just set foot on the street when a big white Pontiac
Bonneville came barreling by, a real boat, with prodigious overhangs,
front and back, the kind of twenty-foot frigate they stopped making
about 1980. It came screeching and nose-diving to a stop on the far
corner. The Bonneville’s door, a gigantic expanse of molded sheet metal,
about five feet wide, opened with a sad torque pop, and a judge named
Myron Kovitsky climbed out. He was about sixty, short, thin, bald, wiry,
with a sharp nose, hollow eyes, and a grim set to his mouth. Through the
back window of the Bonneville, Kramer could see a silhouette sliding
over into the driver’s seat vacated by the judge. That would be his
wife.</p>
<p>The sound of the enormous old car door opening and the sight of this
little figure getting out were depressing. The judge, Mike Kovitsky,
comes to work in a greaser yacht practically ten years old. As a Supreme
Court judge, he made 5,100. Kramer knew the figures by heart. He had
maybe 5,000 left after taxes. For a sixty-year-old man in the upper
reaches of the legal profession, that was pathetic. Downtown…in the
world of Andy Heller…they were paying people right out of law school
that much to start. And this man whose car goes thwop every time he
opens the door is at the top of the hierarchy here in the island
fortress. He, Kramer, occupied some uncertain position in the middle. If
he played his cards right and managed to ingratiate himself with the
Bronx Democratic organization, this—thwop!— was the eminence to which he
might aspire three decades from now.</p>
<p>Kramer was halfway across the street when it began:</p>
<p>“Yo! Kramer!”</p>
<p>It was a huge voice. Kramer couldn’t tell where it was coming
from.</p>
<p>“You cocksucker!”</p>
<p>Whuh? It stopped him in his tracks. A sensation—a sound—like rushing
steam—filled his skull.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kramer, you piece a shit!”</p>
<p>It was another voice. They—</p>
<p>“Yo! Fuckhead!”</p>
<p>They were coming from the back of the van, the blue-and-orange van,
the one closest to him, no more than thirty feet away. He couldn’t see
them. He couldn’t make them out through the mesh over the windows.</p>
<p>“Yo! Kramer! You Hymie asshole!”</p>
<p>Hymie! How did they even know he was Jewish! He didn’t look—Kramer
wasn’t a—why would they—it rocked him!</p>
<p>“Yo! Kramer! You faggot! Kiss my ass!”</p>
<p>“Aaayyyyyyy, maaaaan, you steeeck uppy yass! You steeeck uppy
yass!”</p>
<p>A Latin voice—the very barbarism of the pronunciation twisted the
knife in a little farther.</p>
<p>“Yo! Shitface!”</p>
<p>“Aaaayyyyyy! You keesa sol! You keeeesa sol!”</p>
<p>“Yo! Kramer! Eatcho muvva!”</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaayy! Maaaan! Fokky you! Fokky you!”</p>
<p>It was a chorus! A rain of garbage! A Rigoletto from the sewer, from
the rancid gullet of the Bronx!</p>
<p>Kramer was still out in the middle of the street. What should he do?
He stared at the van. He couldn’t make out a thing. Which ones?…Which of
them…from out of that endless procession of baleful blacks and
Latins…But no! Don’t look! He looked away. Who was watching? Did he just
take this unbelievable abuse and keep walking to the Walton Avenue
entrance, while they poured more of it all over him, or did he confront
them?…Confront them? How?…No! He’d pretend it wasn’t him they were
yelling at…Who was to know the difference!…He’d keep walking up 161st
Street and go around to the main entrance! No one had to know it was
him! He scanned the sidewalk by the Walton Avenue entrance, which was
close to the vans…Nothing but the usual poor sad citizens…They had
stopped in their tracks. They were staring at the van…The guard! The
guard at the Walton Avenue entrance knew him! The guard would know he
was trying to get away and finesse the whole thing! But the guard wasn’t
there…He’d probably ducked inside the doorway so he wouldn’t have to do
anything himself. Then Kramer saw Kovitsky. The judge was on the
sidewalk about fifteen feet from the entrance. He was standing there,
staring at the van. Then he looked right at Kramer. Shit! He knows me!
He knows they’re yelling at me! This little figure, who had just
emerged—thwop!—from his Bonneville, stood between Kramer and his orderly
retreat.</p>
<p>“Yo! Kramer! You yellow shitbird!”</p>
<p>“Hey! You bald-headed worm!”</p>
<p>“Aaaaaayyyy! You steecka balda ed uppas sol! Steeecka balda ed uppas
sol!”</p>
<p>Bald? Why bald? He wasn’t bald. He was losing a little hair, you
bastards, but he was a long way from being bald! Wait a minute! Not him
at all—they’d spotted the judge, Kovitsky. Now they had two targets.</p>
<p>“Yo! Kramer! What you got inna bag, man?”</p>
<p>“Hey, you bald-headed old fart!”</p>
<p>“You shiny ol’ shitfa brains!”</p>
<p>“Gotcho balls inna bag, Kramer?”</p>
<p>They were in it together, him and Kovitsky. Now he couldn’t make his
end run to the 161st Street entrance. So he kept walking across the
street. He felt as if he were underwater. He cut a glance at Kovitsky.
But Kovitsky was no longer looking at him. He was walking straight
toward the van. His head was lowered. He was glaring. You could see the
whites of his eyes. His pupils were like two death rays burning just
beneath his upper eyelids. Kramer had seen him in court like this…with
his head lowered and his eyes ablaze.</p>
<p>The voices inside the van tried to drive him back.</p>
<p>“What you looking at, you shriveled little pecker?”</p>
<p>“Yaaaaggghh, come on! Come on, wormdick!”</p>
<p>But the chorus was losing its rhythm. They didn’t know what to make
of this wiry little fury.</p>
<p>Kovitsky walked right up to the van and tried to stare through the
mesh. He put his hands on his hips.</p>
<p>“Yeah! What you think you looking at?”</p>
<p>“Sheeeeuh! Gon’ give you something to look at, bro’!”</p>
<p>But they were losing steam. Now Kovitsky walked to the front of the
van. He turned those blazing eyes on the driver.</p>
<p>“Do…you…hear…that?” said the little judge, pointing toward the rear
of the van.</p>
<p>“Whuh?” says the driver. “Whaddaya?” He didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“Are you fucking deaf?” said Kovitsky. “Your
prisoners…your…prisoners…You’re an officer of the Department of
Corrections…”</p>
<p>He started jabbing his finger toward the man.</p>
<p>“Your…prisoners…You let your prisoners pull…this shit…on the citizens
of this community and on the officers of this court?”</p>
<p>The driver was a swarthy fat man, pudgy, around fifty, or some
gray-lard middle age, a civil-service lifer…and all at once his eyes and
his mouth opened up, without a sound coming out, and he lifted his
shoulders, and he turned his palms up and the corners of his mouth
down.</p>
<p>It was the primordial shrug of the New York streets, the look that
said, “Egggh, whaddaya? Whaddaya want from me?” And in this specific
instance: “Whaddaya want me to do, crawl back in that cage with that
lot?”</p>
<p>It was the age-old New York cry for mercy, unanswerable and
undeniable.</p>
<p>Kovitsky stared at the man and shook his head the way you do when
you’ve just seen a hopeless case. Then he turned and walked back to the
rear of the van.</p>
<p>“Here come Hymie!”</p>
<p>“Unnh! Unnnh! Unnnhh!”</p>
<p>“Chew my willie, Yo’ Honor.”</p>
<p>Kovitsky stared at the window, still trying to make out his enemy
through the heavy mesh. Then he took a deep breath, and there was a
tremendous snuffling sound in his nose and a deep rumbling in his chest
and throat. It seemed incredible that such a volcanic sound could come
from out of such a small thin body. And then he spit. He propelled a
prodigious gob of spit toward the window of the van. It hit the wire
mesh and hung there, a huge runny yellow oyster, part of which began to
sag like some hideous virulent strand of gum or taffy with a glob on the
bottom of it. And there it remained, gleaming in the sun for those
inside, whoever they might be, to contemplate at their leisure.</p>
<p>It stunned them. The whole chorus stopped. For one strange feverish
moment there was nothing in the world, in the solar system, in the
universe, in all of astronomy, but the cage and this one gleaming,
oozing, pendulous sunlit gob of spit.</p>
<p>Then, keeping his right hand close to his chest so that no one on the
sidewalk could see it, the judge shot them the finger and turned on his
heels and walked toward the entrance to the building.</p>
<p>He was halfway to the door before they got their breath back.</p>
<p>“Yeggghhh, fuck you, too, man!”</p>
<p>“You wanna…sheeeeuh…you try that…”</p>
<p>But their hearts weren’t in it anymore. The grisly esprit of the
prison-van uprising had fizzled in the face of this furious blazing
little steel rod of a man.</p>
<p>Kramer hurried after Kovitsky and caught up with him as he was going
in the Walton Street entrance. He had to catch up with him. He had to
show him that he was with him all along. It was the two of them out
there taking that insidious abuse.</p>
<p>The guard had reappeared at the door. “Good morning, Judge,” he said,
as if it were just another day at the island fortress of Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Kovitsky barely looked at him. He was preoccupied. His head was
down.</p>
<p>Kramer touched his shoulder. “Hey, Judge, you’re too much!” Kramer
beamed, as if the two of them had just been through a great battle,
shoulder to shoulder. “They shut up! I couldn’t believe it! They shut
up!”</p>
<p>Kovitsky stopped and looked Kramer up and down, as if looking at
someone he had never seen before.</p>
<p>“Fucking useless,” said the judge.</p>
<p>He’s blaming me for doing nothing, for not helping him—but in the
next instant Kramer realized that Kovitsky was in fact talking about the
driver of the van.</p>
<p>“Well, the poor sonofabitch,” said Kovitsky, “he’s terrified. I’d be
ashamed to have a job like that if I was that fucking terrified.”</p>
<p>He seemed to be talking more to himself than to Kramer. He kept on
talking about this fucking whatever and that fucking whatever. The
profanity scarcely even registered on Kramer. The courthouse was like
the army. From the judges on down to the guards there was one
all-purpose adjective or participle or whatever it should be called, and
after a while it was as natural as breathing. No, Kramer’s mind was
racing ahead. He was afraid the next words out of Kovitsky’s mouth were
going to be “Why did you just fucking stand there, doing nothing?” He
was already inventing excuses. “I couldn’t tell where it was coming
from…I didn’t know if it was from the van or…”</p>
<p>The fluorescent lighting gave the hallway the dim toxic haze of an
X-ray clinic.</p>
<p>“…this Hymie business,” Kovitsky was saying. Then he gave Kramer a
look that clearly required a response.</p>
<p>Kramer didn’t know what the hell he had been talking about.</p>
<p>“Hymie?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, ‘Here comes Hymie,’” said Kovitsky. “ ‘Wormdick.’ What
difference does that make, ‘wormdick.’ ” He laughed, genuinely amused by
the thought. “ ‘Wormdick’…But ‘Hymie.’ That’s fucking poison. That’s
hate! That’s anti-Semitic. And for what? Without the Yiddishe, they’d
still be laying asphalt and looking up shotgun barrels in South
Carolina, is what the fuck they’d be doing, the poor bastards.”</p>
<p>An alarm went off. A frantic ring filled the hall. It pounded
Kramer’s ears in waves. Judge Kovitsky had to raise his voice to be
heard, but he didn’t even look around. Kramer didn’t bat an eye. The
alarm meant a prisoner had escaped or some skinny little thug’s brother
had pulled out a revolver in a courtroom, or some gargantuan tenant had
grabbed a 130-pound hearing officer in a hammerlock. Or maybe it was
only a fire. The first few times Kramer heard the alarm on the island
fortress of Gibraltar, his eyes jumped around and he braced himself for
the clatter of a herd of guards wearing military-box-toed leather shoes
and waving .38s, running along the marble floors trying to catch some
nutball in supergraphic sneakers who, jacked up by fear, does the
hundred in 8.4. But after a while he ignored it. It was the normal state
of red alert, panic, and disarray in the Bronx County Building. All
around Kramer and the judge, people were swiveling their heads in every
direction. Such sad faces…They were entering Gibraltar for the first
time, on Christ knows what sad missions.</p>
<p>All at once Kovitsky was motioning toward the floor and saying, “…is
this, Kramer?”</p>
<p>“This?” said Kramer, desperately trying to figure out what the judge
was talking about.</p>
<p>“These fucking shoes,” said Kovitsky.</p>
<p>“Ah! Shoes,” said Kramer. “They’re running shoes, Judge.”</p>
<p>“Is that something Weiss thought up?”</p>
<p>“Noooo,” said Kramer, chuckling as if moved by the judge’s wit.</p>
<p>“Jogging for Justice? Is that what Abe has you guys doing, jogging
for Justice?”</p>
<p>“No, no, no, no.” More chuckles and a big grin, since Kovitsky
obviously loved this line, jogging for Justice.</p>
<p>“Christ, every kid who sticks up a Red Apple’s in my courtroom
wearing these goddamned things, and now you guys?”</p>
<p>“Nooo-ho-ho.”</p>
<p>“You think you’re gonna come in my part looking like this?”</p>
<p>“Nooooooo-ho-ho-ho! Wouldn’t think of it, Judge.”</p>
<p>The alarm kept ringing. The new people, the new sad faces who had
never been inside this citadel before, looked all about with their eyes
wide and their mouths open, and they saw a bald-headed old white man in
a gray suit and a white shirt and a necktie and a balding young white
man in a gray suit and a white shirt and a necktie just standing there
talking, smiling, yakking, shooting the breeze, and so if these two
white people, so obviously a part of the Power, were just standing
there, without so much as lifting an eyebrow, how bad could it be?</p>
<p>As the alarm rang in his head, Kramer grew still more depressed.</p>
<p>Right then and there he made up his mind. He was going to do
something—something startling, something rash, something desperate,
whatever it took. He was going to break out of here. He was going to
rise up from this muck. He was going to light up the sky, seize the Life
for himself—</p>
<p>He could see the girl with brown lipstick again, just as surely as if
she were standing right next to him in this sad grim place.</p>
