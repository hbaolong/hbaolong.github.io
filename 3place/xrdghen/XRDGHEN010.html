<h4 id="some-brit-named-fallow">9. Some Brit Named Fallow</h4>
<p>This time the explosion of the telephone threw his heart into
tachycardia, and each contraction forced the blood through his head with
such pressure—a stroke!—he was going to have a stroke!—lying here alone
in his high-rise American hovel!—a stroke! The panic roused the beast.
The beast came straight to the surface and showed its snout.</p>
<p>Fallow opened one eye and saw the telephone lying in a brown
Streptolon nest. He was dizzy, and he hadn’t even lifted his head. Great
curds of eye trash swam in front of his face. The pounding blood was
breaking up the mercury yolk into curds, and the curds were coming out
of his eye. The telephone exploded again. He closed his eye. The snout
of the beast was right behind his eyelid. That pedophile business—</p>
<p>And last night had started off as such an ordinary evening!</p>
<p>Having less than forty dollars to get him through the next three
days, he had done the usual. He had called up a Yank. He had called up
Gil Archer, the literary agent, who was married to a woman whose name
Fallow could never remember. He had suggested that they meet for dinner
at Leicester’s, leaving the impression he would be bringing a girl along
himself. Archer arrived with his wife, whereas he arrived alone.
Naturally, under the circumstances, Archer, ever the bland polite Yank,
picked up the bill. Such a quiet evening; such an early evening; such a
routine evening for an Englishman in New York, a dull dinner paid for by
a Yank; he really was thinking about getting up and going home. And then
Caroline Heftshank and this artist friend of hers, an Italian, Filippo
Chirazzi, came in, and they stopped by the table and sat down, and
Archer asked them if they would like something to drink, and he said why
didn’t they get another bottle of wine, and so Archer ordered another
bottle of wine, and they drank that, and then they drank another one and
another one, and now Leicester’s was packed and roaring with all the
usual faces, and Alex Britt-Withers sent over one of his waiters to
offer a round of drinks on the house, which made Archer feel socially
successful, recognized-by-the-owner sort of thing—the Yanks were very
keen on that—and Caroline Heftshank kept hugging her handsome young
Italian, Chirazzi, who was posing with his pretty profile up in the air,
as if one were to feel privileged just to be breathing the same air as
himself. St. John came over from another table to admire young Signor
Chirazzi, much to Billy Cortez’s displeasure, and Signor Chirazzi told
St. John it was necessary for a painter to paint with “the eyes of a
child,” and St. John said that he himself tried to view the world with
the eyes of a child, to which Billy Cortez said, “He said child,
St. John, not pedophile.” Signor Chirazzi posed some more, with his long
neck and Valentino nose rising up from out of a ridiculous electric-blue
Punk shirt with a three-quarter-inch collar and a pink glitter necktie,
and so Fallow said it was more postmodern for a painter to have the eyes
of a pedophile than the eyes of a child, and what did Signor Chirazzi
think? Caroline, who was quite drunk, told him not to be stupid, said it
quite sharply, and Fallow reared back, meaning only to strike a pose
mocking the young painter, but lost his balance and fell on the floor.
Much laughter. When he got up, he was dizzy, and he held on to Caroline,
just to steady himself, but young Signor Chirazzi took offense, from the
depths of his Italian manly honor, and tried to shove Fallow, and both
Fallow and Caroline now went down, and Chirazzi tried to jump on Fallow,
and St. John, for whatever reason, now jumped on the pretty Italian, and
Billy Cortez was screaming, and Fallow struggled up, carrying an
enormous weight, and Britt-Withers was over him, yelling, “For God’s
sake!” and then a whole bunch of people were on top of him, and they all
went crashing out the front door onto the sidewalk on Lexington
Avenue—P</p>
<p>The telephone exploded again, and Fallow was terrified at what he
might hear if he picked up the receiver. He could remember nothing from
the time they all went crashing out onto the sidewalk until this moment.
He swung his feet out of the bed, and they were all still roaring and
boiling inside his skull, and his whole body felt sore. He crawled
across the carpet to the exploding telephone and lay down beside it. The
carpet felt dry, metallic, dusty, filthy against his cheek.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Aaaayyy, Pete! How wahya!”</p>
<p>It was a cheery voice, a Yank voice, a New York voice, a particularly
crude sort of New York voice. Fallow found this Yank voice even more
jarring than the Pete. Well, at least it wasn’t The City Light. Nobody
at The City Light would be calling him with such a cheery voice.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” said Fallow. His own voice was an animal in a hole.</p>
<p>“Jeezus, Pete, you sound terrific. Any pulse? Hey. This is Al
Vogel.”</p>
<p>The news made him close his eyes again. Vogel was one of those
typical Yank celebrities who, to an Englishman reading about them in
London, seemed so colorful, irrepressible, and morally admirable. In
person, in New York, they always turned out the same way. They were
Yanks; which is to say, crude bores. Vogel was well known in England as
an American lawyer whose specialty was unpopular political causes. He
defended radicals and pacifists, much the way Charles Garry, William
Kunstler, and Mark Lane had. Unpopular, of course, merely meant
unpopular with ordinary people. Vogel’s defendants were certainly
popular enough with the press and intellectuals in the 1960s and 1970s,
especially in Europe, where anyone defended by Albert Vogel grew wings,
a halo, a toga, and a torch. Few of these latter-day saints had any
money, however, and Fallow often wondered how Vogel made a living,
especially since the 1980s had not been kind to him. In the 1980s not
even the press and intellectuals had any patience for the sort of
irascible, seething, foul-humored, misery-loving, popped-vein clientele
he specialized in. Lately Fallow had been running into the great
defender at the most extraordinary parties. Vogel would go to the
opening of a parking lot (and Fallow would say hello to him there).</p>
<p>“Oh, hi-i-i-i,” said Fallow in what ended up as a moan.</p>
<p>“I called your office first, Pete, and they said they hadn’t seen
you.”</p>
<p>Not good, thought Fallow. He wondered when, if, why, where he had
given Vogel his home telephone number.</p>
<p>“You still there, Pete?”</p>
<p>“Ummmmmmmm.” Fallow had his eyes closed. He had no sense of up or
down. “It’s all right. I’m working at home today.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got something I want to talk to you about, Pete. I think
there’s a hell of a story in it.”</p>
<p>“Ummmm.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, only I’d just as soon not go into it over the telephone. I
tell you what. Whyn’t you come have lunch with me. I’ll meet you at the
Regent’s Park at one o’clock.”</p>
<p>“Ummmm. I don’t know, Al. The Regent’s Park. Where is that?”</p>
<p>“On Central Park South, near the New York Athletic Club.”</p>
<p>“Ummmmm.”</p>
<p>Fallow was torn between two profound instincts. On the one hand, the
thought of getting off the floor, of shifting the mercury yolk for a
second time, for no other reason than to listen to an American bore and
has-been for an hour or two…On the other hand, a free meal at a
restaurant. The pterodactyl and the brontosaurus were locked in mortal
combat on the cliff over the Lost Continent.</p>
<p>The free meal won, as it had so often in the past.</p>
<p>“All right, Al, I’ll see you at one o’clock. Where is this place
again?”</p>
<p>“On Central Park South, Pete, right near the New York A.C. It’s a
nice place. You can look at the park. You can look at a statue of José
Martí on a horse.”</p>
<p>Fallow said goodbye and struggled to his feet, and the yolk was
yawing this way and that way, and he stubbed his toe on the metal frame
of the bed. The pain was terrific, but it focused his central nervous
system. He took a shower in the dark. The plastic shower curtain was
suffocating. When he closed his eyes he had the feeling he was keeling
over. From time to time he had to hold on to the shower head.</p>
<p>The Regent’s Park was the sort of New York restaurant favored by
married men having affairs with young women. It was grand, glossy, and
solemn, with a great deal of marble inside and out, a colossal stiff
neck whose hauteur appealed mainly to people staying at the nearby
Ritz-Carlton, Park Lane, St. Moritz, and Plaza Hotels. In the history of
New York no conversation had ever begun with: “I was having lunch at the
Regent’s Park the other day and…”</p>
<p>True to his word, Albert Vogel had secured a table beside the great
window. This was not a hard ticket at the Regent’s Park. Nevertheless,
there it was, the park, in its springtime glory. And there was the
statue of José Martí, which Vogel had also promised. Martí’s horse was
rearing up, and the great Cuban revolutionary was leaning perilously to
the right in his saddle. Fallow averted his eyes. An unsteady park
statue was too much to contend with.</p>
<p>Vogel was in his usual hearty mood. Fallow watched his lips move
without hearing a word. The blood drained from Fallow’s face, and then
his chest and arms. His hide turned cold. Then a million little scalding
hot minnows tried to escape from his arteries and reach the surface.
Perspiration broke out on his forehead. He wondered if he was dying.
This was the way heart attacks began. He had read that. He wondered if
Vogel knew about coronary resuscitation. Vogel looked like someone’s
grandmother. His hair was white, not a gray-white, but a silky pure
white. He was short and pudgy. In his palmy days he had been pudgy, too,
but he had looked “scrappy,” as the Yanks liked to say. Now his skin was
pinkish and delicate. His hands were tiny and had ropy old veins leading
up to the knuckles. A cheery old woman.</p>
<p>“Pete,” said Vogel, “what’ll you have to drink?”</p>
<p>“Not a thing,” said Fallow, rather overemphatically. Then to the
waiter: “Could I have some water.”</p>
<p>“I want a margarita on the rocks,” said Vogel. “Sure you won’t change
your mind, Pete?”</p>
<p>Fallow shook his head. That was a mistake. A poisonous hammering
began inside his skull.</p>
<p>“Just one to turn the motor over?”</p>
<p>“No, no.”</p>
<p>Vogel put his elbows on the table and leaned forward and began
scanning the room, and then his eyes fastened on a table slightly behind
him. At the table were a man in a gray business suit and a girl in her
late teens with long, straight, very showy blond hair.</p>
<p>“You see that girl?” said Vogel. “I could swear that girl was on this
committee, whatever they call it, at the University of Michigan.”</p>
<p>“What committee?”</p>
<p>“This student group. They run the lecture program. I gave a lecture
at the University of Michigan two nights ago.”</p>
<p>So what? thought Fallow. Vogel looked over his shoulder again.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not her. But, Christ, it sure looks like her. These
goddamned girls at these colleges—you wanna know why people go out on
the lecture circuit in this country?”</p>
<p>No, thought Fallow.</p>
<p>“Okay, for the money. But not counting that. You wanna know why?”</p>
<p>The Yanks constantly repeated introductory questions.</p>
<p>“These goddamned girls.” Vogel shook his head and stared off
distractedly for a moment, as if stunned by the very thought. “I swear
to God, Pete, you have to hold yourself back. Otherwise, you’d feel so
fucking guilty. These girls—today—well, when I was growing up, the big
deal was that when you went to college, you could drink when you felt
like it. Okay? These girls, they go to college so they can get laid when
they feel like it. And who do they want? This is the part that’s really
pathetic. Do they want nice-looking healthy boys their own age? No. You
wanna know who? They want…Authority…Power…Fame…Prestige…They wanna get
laid by the teachers! The teachers go crazy at these places now. You
know, when the Movement was going strong, one of the things we tried to
do on the campuses was to break down that wall of formality between the
faculty and the students, because it was nothing but an instrument of
control. But now, Jesus Christ, I wonder. I guess they all want to get
laid by their fathers, if you believe Freud, which I don’t. You know,
this is one thing the women’s movement has made no headway with. When a
woman reaches forty, her problems are just as big now as they ever
were—and a guy like me has never had it so good. I’m not so old, but,
f’r Chrissake, I’ve got gray hair—”</p>
<p>White, thought Fallow, like an old woman’s.</p>
<p>“—and it doesn’t make any difference whatsoever. A little touch of
celebrity and they fall over. They just fall over. I’m not bragging,
because it’s so pathetic. And these goddamned girls, each one is more of
a knockout than the last one. I’d like to give them a lecture on that
subject, but they probably wouldn’t know what I was talking about. They
have no frame of reference, about anything. The lecture I gave the night
before last was on student commitment in the 1980s.”</p>
<p>“I was dying to know,” said Fallow in the back of his throat, without
moving his lips.</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>The Yanks said pardon? instead of what?</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“I told them what it was like on the campuses fifteen years ago.” His
face clouded over. “But I don’t know…fifteen years ago, fifty years ago,
a hundred years ago…they have no frame of reference. It’s all so remote
to them. Ten years ago…five years ago…Five years ago was before Walkman
earphones. They can’t imagine that.”</p>
<p>Fallow stopped listening. There was no way Vogel could be deflected
from his course. He was irony-proof. Fallow glanced at the girl with the
long yellow hair. Thrashing through the restaurant. Caroline Heftshank
and the frightened look on her face. Had he done something just before
they all went crashing out the door? Whatever—she deserved it—but what
was it? Vogel’s lips were moving. He was going through his entire
lecture. Fallow’s eyelids dropped shut. The beast broke the surface and
thrashed about and eyed him. He eyed him straight down his filthy snout.
Now the beast had him. He couldn’t move.</p>
<p>“…Managua?” asked Vogel.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You ever been there?” asked Vogel.</p>
<p>Fallow shook his head. The yawing motion made him nauseous.</p>
<p>“You oughta go. Every journalist oughta go. It’s about the size
of…oh, I don’t know, East Hampton. If it’s that big. Would you like to
go there? It would be easy enough to set it up for you.”</p>
<p>Fallow didn’t want to shake his head again. “Is that the story you
wanted to tell me about?”</p>
<p>Vogel paused a moment, as if weighing the remark for sarcastic
content.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, “but it’s not a bad idea. About one-fiftieth of
everything that oughta be said about Nicaragua gets printed in this
country. No, what I was talking about is something that happened in the
Bronx four days ago. It might as well be Nicaragua, if you happen to
live there. Anyway, you know who Reverend Bacon is, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I think so.”</p>
<p>“He’s a—well, he’s a—you’ve read about him or seen him on TV, haven’t
you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Vogel laughed. “You wanna know where I first met him? In this
gigantic duplex apartment on Park Avenue, Peggy Fryskamp’s apartment,
back when she was interested in the Geronimo Brotherhood. She gave a
fund-raising party there. This must’ve been the late sixties, early
seventies. There was this guy Flying Deer. He gave the soul talk, we
used to call it. There was always the soul talk and the money talk.
Anyway, he gave the soul talk, the spiritual talk. She didn’t know the
sonofabitch was loaded. She just thought it was Indian talk, the crazy
way he sounded. Fifteen minutes later he threw up all over this
eighty-thousand-dollar Duncan Phyfe piano Peggy had, all over the keys
and the strings and the hammers and everything. You know those little
felt hammers? Oh, it was outrageous. She never got over it. That jerk
blew a good deal that night. And you wanna know who really gave him
hell? Reverend Bacon. Yeah. He was getting ready to ask Peggy to support
some of the things he had going, and when this Flying Deer threw his
cookies all over the Duncan Phyfe, he knew he could say good-bye to
Peggy Fryskamp. He started calling him Flying Beer. ‘Flying Deer? Flying
Beer, if I know anything about it!’ Jesus, it was funny. But he wasn’t
trying to be funny. Bacon never tries to be funny. Anyway, he has this
woman who works for him sometimes, Annie Lamb, from the Bronx. Annie
Lamb lives in the Edgar Allan Poe project with this one son she has,
Henry.”</p>
<p>“She’s black?” asked Fallow.</p>
<p>“Yeah, she’s black. Practically everybody in the Poe projects is
black or Puerto Rican. By law, incidentally, all these projects are
supposed to be integrated.” Vogel shrugged his eyebrows. “Anyway, this
Annie Lamb is an unusual woman.” Vogel recounted the history of Annie
Lamb and her family, culminating in the hit-and-run Mercedes-Benz that
had left her promising son, Henry, at death’s door.</p>
<p>Unfortunate, thought Fallow, but where’s the story?</p>
<p>As if anticipating that objection, Vogel said: “Now, there’s two
sides to this thing, and both of them have to do with what happens to a
good kid like this if he has the misfortune of being black and growing
up in the Bronx. I mean, here’s a kid who did everything right. You talk
about Henry Lamb, you’re talking about the one percent who do exactly
what the system tells them they’re supposed to do. Okay? So what
happens? First, the hospital treats the kid for…a broken wrist! If this
had been a middle-class white kid, they’d’ve gone over him with the
X-ray, the CAT scan, the nuclear magnetic resonance, everything there
is. Second, the police and the D.A. won’t move on the case. This is what
really infuriates the kid’s mother. Here’s a hit-and-run, they’ve got
part of the license number and the make of the car, and they’re doing
zip about it.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Well, basically, it’s just some kid in the South Bronx who gets hit
by a car, as far as they’re concerned. They can’t be bothered. But what
they’re saying is, there were no witnesses, except for the victim
himself, and he’s in a terminal coma, and so they wouldn’t have a case
even if they found the car and the driver. Now, suppose this were your
son. He’s provided the information, but they’re not going to use it
because technically it’s hearsay.”</p>
<p>The whole thing made Fallow’s head hurt. He couldn’t imagine having a
son, and certainly not in some council flats in the Bronx section of New
York City in America.</p>
<p>“It’s an unfortunate situation,” said Fallow, “but I’m not altogether
sure there’s a story in it.”</p>
<p>“Well, there’s gonna be a story in it very shortly for somebody,
Pete,” said Vogel. “The community is up in arms. They’re about to
explode. Reverend Bacon is organizing a protest demonstration.”</p>
<p>“What exactly are they exploding over?”</p>
<p>“They’re tired of being treated as if human life in the South Bronx
means nothing! And I’m telling you, when Bacon gets hold of something,
things happen. He’s not Martin Luther King or Bishop Tutu. Okay? He’s
not gonna win any Nobel Prize. He’s got his own way of doing things, and
sometimes it might not stand close scrutiny. But that’s one reason he’s
effective. He’s what Hobsbawm called a primitive revolutionary. Hobsbawm
was a Brit, right?”</p>
<p>“He still is.”</p>
<p>“I thought he was. He had this theory about primitive
revolutionaries. There are certain natural leaders of the underclasses,
and the power structure interprets what they do as crime—they may even
sincerely interpret it that way—but what that person is, is a
revolutionary. And that’s what Bacon is. I admire him. And I feel sorry
for these people. Anyway, I think there’s a hell of a story here, quite
aside from the philosophical considerations.”</p>
<p>Fallow closed his eyes. He saw the snout of the beast, lit up by soft
bistro lights. Then the icy chill. He opened his eyes. Vogel was staring
at him with his cheery old pink nanny’s grin. This ridiculous
country.</p>
<p>“Look, Pete, the worst you’ll get out of this is a good
human-interest story. And if things break right, you’ll be on to
something big. I can get you an interview with Annie Lamb. I can get you
an interview with Reverend Bacon. I can take you right into the
intensive-care unit, where the kid is. I mean, he’s in a coma, but you
can see him.”</p>
<p>Fallow tried to conceive of transferring the mercury egg and his
bilious innards to the Bronx. He could scarcely imagine surviving the
trip. From his viewpoint the Bronx was like the Arctic. It was somewhere
to the north, and people didn’t go there.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Al. My specialty is supposed to be the high life.” He
attempted a smile.</p>
<p>“Supposed to be, Peter, supposed to be. They won’t fire you if you
come in with a hell of a good story from the low life.”</p>
<p>The word fire was what did it. He closed his eyes. The snout was not
there. Instead, he saw the Dead Mouse’s face. He could see the Mouse
looking toward his cubicle in the city room at this moment and finding
it empty. Fear suffused his every cell, and he put his napkin to his
forehead.</p>
<p>“Do you mind if I ask you something, Al?”</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“What’s your interest in all this?”</p>
<p>“None, if you’re talking about material interest. Reverend Bacon
called me and asked my advice, and I told him I’d try to help him out,
that’s all. I like him. I like what he’s trying to do. I like the way he
shakes up this fucking city. I’m on his side. I told him he should try
to get this thing into the newspapers before he has the protest
demonstration. That way he’s gonna get more television coverage and
everything else. I’m telling you the plain truth now. I thought of you
because I figured maybe you could use an opportunity like this. This
could be to your advantage and to the advantage of a lot of decent
people who never get a fucking break in this city.”</p>
<p>Fallow shuddered. Just what had Vogel heard about his situation? He
didn’t really want to know. He knew he was being used. At the same time,
here was a piece of meat to throw to the Mouse.</p>
<p>“Well, maybe you’re right.”</p>
<p>“I know I’m right, Pete. This is gonna be a big story one way or the
other. You might as well be the one to break it.”</p>
<p>“You can take me to see these people?”</p>
<p>“Oh, sure. Don’t worry about that. The only thing is, you can’t sit
on the story. Bacon is ready to go.”</p>
<p>“Ummmm. Let me take down some of these names.” Fallow reached into
the side pocket of his jacket. Christ, he hadn’t even picked up a
notebook or a piece of paper before he left. From out of the pocket he
brought a notice from Con Edison warning him that his gas and
electricity were about to be cut off. He couldn’t even write on it. It
had print on both sides. Vogel watched all this and, without comment,
produced a memorandum pad and handed it to him. Then he handed him a
silver ballpoint pen. He repeated the names and details.</p>
<p>“I tell you what,” said Fallow. “I’m going to call the city desk
straightaway.”</p>
<p>He got up and caromed off a chair at the next table, where an old
woman in a Chanel-style suit was trying to lift a spoonful of sorrel
soup to her mouth. She glared at him.</p>
<p>“Whaddaya want to eat?” said Vogel. “I’ll order for you.”</p>
<p>“Nothing. A bowl of tomato soup. Some chicken paillard.”</p>
<p>“Some wine?”</p>
<p>“No. Well. Just a glass.”</p>
<p>The coin telephone was in a vestibule across from the hatcheck room,
where a pretty girl sat on a high stool reading a book. Her eyes peeked
out from a sinister black ellipse carefully drawn around her eyelids.
Fallow rang up Frank de Pietro, the city editor of The City Light. De
Pietro was one of the few Americans in an important editorial position
on the newspaper. They needed someone from New York as city editor. The
other Englishmen who worked there, like Fallow himself, were acquainted
with a single stretch of Manhattan from the trendy restaurants in
TriBeCa on the south to the trendy restaurants in Yorkville, near
Eighty-sixth Street, on the north. The rest of New York might as well
have been Damascus.</p>
<p>“Yeah?” The voice of Frank de Pietro. His enthusiasm over having a
call from Peter Fallow at a busy time of the day was imperceptible.</p>
<p>“Frank,” said Fallow, “are you familiar with a place called the Edgar
Allan Poe projects?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Are you?”</p>
<p>Fallow didn’t know which was more unpleasant, this Yank habit of
saying yeah for yes, or the incredulity in the man’s voice.
Nevertheless, he plowed on, telling Albert Vogel’s story with
embellishments, where needed, and with no mention of Albert Vogel. He
left the impression that he had already been in touch with Reverend
Bacon and the victim’s mother, and that his imminent appearance in the
Bronx was awaited by one and all. De Pietro told him to go ahead and
check it out. This he did with no particular enthusiasm, either. And yet
Fallow felt his heart fill with a quite unexpected joy.</p>
<p>When he returned to the table, Vogel said, “Hey, how’d it go? Your
soup’s getting cold.” The words barely made it out of his mouth, which
was crammed full of food.</p>
<p>A large bowl of tomato soup and a glass of white wine were at
Fallow’s place. Vogel was busy working on a hideous-looking joint of
veal.</p>
<p>“They like it, hunh?”</p>
<p>“Ummmmmm.” Well, they don’t despise it, thought Fallow. His nausea
began withdrawing. The yolk grew smaller. A crisp exhilaration, not
unlike that of an athlete entering the fray, stole into his nervous
system. He felt…almost clean. It was the emotion, never commented upon
by the poets, enjoyed by those who feel that, for once, they are earning
their pay.</p>
<p>It was Kramer’s turn to wear the beeper on his waistband for twelve
hours. In the Homicide Bureau of the Bronx District Attorney’s Office,
somebody, some assistant district attorney, was on call at all times.
The purpose was to have someone to go to crime scenes immediately, to
interview witnesses before they vanished or lost the urge to talk about
the mayhem. For those twelve hours an assistant D.A. was likely to get
stuck with every piece a shit in the Bronx that involved a homicide, and
it was a classic Bronx piece a shit that had brought Kramer here to this
precinct house. A black detective sergeant named Gordon was standing
near the booking desk giving him the details.</p>
<p>“They call the guy Pimp,” said Gordon, “but he’s not a pimp. He’s a
gambler, mainly, and he probably does some dealing in drugs, but he
dresses like a pimp. You’ll see him in a minute. He’s back there in the
locker room wearing some kind of trick suit with a double-breasted
vest.” Gordon shook his head. “He’s sitting on the edge of a chair
eating ribs, holding them like this”—he leaned forward and raised his
hand in a dainty gesture—“so the sauce won’t get on the suit. He had
about forty suits, and when he tells you about those fucking suits,
you’ll think it was his fucking child that’s missing.”</p>
<p>The whole thing had happened because someone had stolen the forty
suits. Oh, this was a real piece a shit. Waves and waves of childishness
and pointless violence, and Kramer hadn’t even heard the whole story
yet.</p>
<p>The main room of the precinct was saturated with the dank and oddly
sweet smell of rotting wood, caused by decades of steam radiators
leaking onto the floors. Most of the floor had been replaced with
concrete. The walls were painted Government Work Green except for an old
battered tongue-and-groove wainscoting, three feet high, around the
bottom. The building had thick walls and high ceilings, now overgrown
with trays of fluorescent lights. Across the way Kramer could see the
backs of the two patrolmen. Their hips were enormous with weaponry and
paraphernalia, including flashlights, summons books, walkie-talkies, and
handcuffs. One of them kept lifting his hands in explanatory gestures to
two women and a man, local residents, whose faces said they didn’t
believe a word of it.</p>
<p>Gordon was telling Kramer: “So he’s in this apartment, and there’s
four guys in there, and one of them is this André Potts, who he figures
knows who took the suits, only André says he don’t know nothing from
nothing, and they’re going back and forth, and finally André’s had
enough of this, and he gets up and walks out of the room. And so what
would you do if some disrespectful sucker got up and turned his back on
you while you’re inquiring about your fucking forty suits? You’d shoot
him in the back, right? So that’s what Pimp did. He shot Mr. André Potts
in the back three times with a .38.”</p>
<p>“You got witnesses?” asked Kramer.</p>
<p>“Oh, we got ’em stacked up.”</p>
<p>At that moment the beeper went off on Kramer’s waistband.</p>
<p>“Can I use your phone?”</p>
<p>Gordon motioned toward an open door that led into the Detective
Bureau, which was an office off the main room. Inside were three dismal
Government Work Gray metal desks. At each desk sat a black man in his
thirties or forties. Each had on Bronx street garb a bit too funky to be
true. Kramer thought of how unusual it was to come across an entire
bureau made up of black detectives. The one at the desk nearest the door
wore a black thermal vest and a sleeveless black T-shirt that showed off
his powerful arms.</p>
<p>Kramer reached toward the telephone on his desk and said, “Use your
phone?”</p>
<p>“Hey, what the fuck, man!”</p>
<p>Kramer pulled his hand back.</p>
<p>“How long I gotta sit here chained up like a fucking animal?”</p>
<p>With that, the man raised his powerful left arm with a terrific
clattering. There was a manacle on his wrist, and from the manacle a
chain. The other end of the chain was manacled to the leg of the desk.
Now the other two, at the other desks, had their arms up in the air,
clattering and yammering. All three of them were chained to the
desks.</p>
<p>“All I did was see the motherfucker whack that sucker, and he was the
motherfucker that whacked that sucker, and I’m the one you got chained
up like a fucking animal, and that motherfucker”—another terrific
clatter as he gestured toward a room in the rear with his left
hand—“he’s sitting back there watching fucking TV and eating ribs.”</p>
<p>Kramer looked to the back of the room, and sure enough, back there in
a locker room was a figure sitting on the edge of a chair lit by the
hectic flush of the television set and eating a length of barbecued rib
of pork. And he was indeed leaning forward daintily. The sleeve of his
jacket was tailored to show a lot of white cuff and gleaming cuff
link.</p>
<p>Now all three were yammering. Fucking ribs…fucking chains!…fucking
TV!</p>
<p>But of course! The witnesses. Once Kramer realized that, everything,
chains and all, fell into place.</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay, okay,” he said to the man in an impatient fashion, “I’ll
take care a you in a minute. I gotta make a phone call.”</p>
<p>Fucking ribs!…shee-uh!…fucking chains!</p>
<p>Kramer called the office, and Gloria, Bernie Fitzgibbon’s secretary,
said Milt Lubell wanted to talk to him. Lubell was Abe Weiss’s press
secretary. Kramer barely knew Lubell; he couldn’t remember talking to
him more than four or five times. Gloria gave him Lubell’s number.</p>
<p>Milt Lubell had worked on the old New York Mirror back when Walter
Winchell still had his column. He had known the great man ever so
slightly and had carried his breathless snap-brim way of talking onward
into the last days of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>“Kramer,” he said, “Kramer, Kramer, lemme see, Kramer. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, okay, I got it. The case of Henry Lamb. Likely to die. What’s it
amount to?”</p>
<p>“It’s a piece a shit,” said Kramer.</p>
<p>“Well, I got a query from The City Light, some Brit named Fallow.
Guy’s got this accent. I thought I was listening to Channel 13. Anyway,
he’s reading me a statement from Reverend Bacon about the case of Henry
Lamb. That’s all I need. The words of Reverend Reginald Bacon in a
British accent. You know Bacon?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Kramer. “I interviewed Henry Lamb’s mother in Bacon’s
office.”</p>
<p>“This guy has something from her, too, but mainly it’s Bacon. Lemme
see, lemme see, lemme see. It says, uh…blah blah blah, blah blah
blah…human life in the Bronx…malfeasance…white middle class…blah blah
blah…nuclear magnetic resonance…Goes on about the nuclear magnetic
resonance. There’s maybe two a the fucking machines in the whole
country, I think…blah blah blah…Lemme see, here it is. He accuses the
district attorney of dragging his feet. We won’t go to the trouble of
proceeding with the case because the kid is a black youth from the Poe
projects and it’s too much trouble.”</p>
<p>“That’s bullshit.”</p>
<p>“Well, I know that, and you know that, but I gotta call this Brit
back and tell him something.”</p>
<p>A tremendous clatter. “How long I gotta sit here in these chains,
man!” The man with the big arms was erupting again. “This is against the
law!”</p>
<p>“Hey!” said Kramer, genuinely annoyed. “You wanna get outta here,
you’ll knock it off. I can’t fucking hear myself talk.” Then to Lubell:
“Sorry, I’m over at the precinct.” He wrapped his hand around his mouth
and the mouthpiece of the telephone and said in a low voice: “They got
three homicide witnesses over here chained to the fucking desk legs in
the Detective Bureau, and they’re going bananas.” He enjoyed the
low-level macho jolt of trotting out this little war story for Lubell,
even though he didn’t even know the man.</p>
<p>“The desk legs!” said Lubell, with an appreciative note. “Jesus
Christ, that I never heard of.”</p>
<p>“Anyway,” said Kramer, “where was I? Okay, we got a Mercedes-Benz
with a license plate beginning with R. For a start, we don’t even know
if we’re talking about a New York State license plate. Okay? That’s for
a start. But let’s suppose we are. There’s 2,500 Mercedes registered in
New York State with license plates starting with R. Okay, now, the
second letter supposedly looks like an E or an F, or maybe a P or a B or
an R, some letter with a vertical on the left and some horizontals going
off of it. Suppose we go with that. We’re still talking about almost
five hundred cars. So whaddaya do? Go after five hundred cars? If you
have a witness who can tell you the boy was hit by such a car, maybe you
do. But there’s no witness, except for the kid, and he’s in a coma and
isn’t coming out. We got no information about a driver. All we have is
two people in a car, two white people, a man and a woman, and on top of
that the kid’s story don’t add up in the first place.”</p>
<p>“Well, whadda I say? The investigation is continuing?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. The investigation is continuing. But unless Martin finds a
witness, there’s no case here. Even if the kid was hit by a car, it
probably wasn’t the kind of collision that would yield forensic evidence
from the car, because the kid don’t have the bodily injuries that are
consistent with such a collision—I mean, f’r Chrissake, there are so
many fucking ifs in this cockamamie story. If you ask me, it’s a piece a
shit. The kid seems like a decent sort, and so does his mother, but
between you and me, I think he got in some kind of scrape and made up
this bullshit story to tell his mother.”</p>
<p>“Well then, why would he dream up part of a license plate? Why
wouldn’t he say he didn’t get the number?”</p>
<p>“How do I know? Why does anybody do anything that they do in this
county? You think this guy, this reporter, is actually gonna write
something?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’m just gonna say that naturally we’re following the
thing closely.”</p>
<p>“Anybody else called you about it?”</p>
<p>“Naw. It sounds like Bacon reached this guy some way.”</p>
<p>“What does Bacon get out of it?”</p>
<p>“Oh, this is one of the hobby horses he rides. The double standard,
white justice, blah blah blah. He’s always out to embarrass the
Mayor.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Kramer, “if he can make something out of this piece a
shit, then he’s a magician.”</p>
<p>By the time Kramer hung up, the three shackled witnesses were
clattering and complaining again. With a heavy heart he realized he was
actually going to have to sit down and talk to these three germs and get
something coherent out of them about a man named Pimp who shot a man who
knew a man who may or may not have known the whereabouts of forty suits.
His entire Friday night was going to get shot in the ass, and he would
have to shoot dice with Fate and ride the subway back down to Manhattan.
He looked back into the locker room once more. That very vision himself,
that Gentleman’s Quarterly cover boy, the man named Pimp, was still back
there, eating ribs and hugely enjoying something on the TV, which lit up
his face in tones of first-degree-burn pink and cobalt-therapy blue.</p>
<p>Kramer stepped outside the Detective Bureau and said to Gordon: “Your
witnesses are getting kinda restless in there. That one guy wants to
wrap his chain around my throat.”</p>
<p>“I had to put the chain on him.”</p>
<p>“I know that. But lemme ask you something. This fellow Pimp, he’s
just sitting back there eating ribs. He’s not chained to anything.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m not worried about Pimp. He’s not going anywhere. He’s
cooling out. He’s contented. This crummy neighborhood is all he knows. I
bet he don’t know New York is on the Atlantic Ocean. He’s a home boy.
No, he’s not going anywhere. He’s only the perpetrator. But a
witness—hey, baby, if I didn’t put the chain on the witness, you
wouldn’t have no-o-o-o-o-body to interview. You’d never see his ass
again. A fucking witness’ll cut out for Santo Domingo faster’n you can
say off-peak fare.”</p>
<p>Kramer headed back to the Detective Bureau to do his duty and
interview the three irate citizens in chains and try to find some order
in this latest piece a shit.</p>
<p>Since The City Light published no Sunday newspaper, there was only a
skeleton crew in the city room on Saturday afternoons. Most of them were
wire-copy editors, scavenging through the material that continued to
come stuttering and shuddering out of the Associated Press and United
Press International machines for items that might be of use for Monday’s
edition. There were three reporters in the city room, plus one down at
Manhattan Central Police Headquarters, in case there occurred some
catastrophe or piece of mayhem so gory that The City Light’s readers
would still want to lap it up on Monday. There was a lone assistant city
editor, who spent most of the afternoon on the telephone, making sales
calls on the City Light’s WATS line, for a sideline of his, which was
selling college fraternity jewelry, wholesale, to fraternity house
managers, who sold the stuff, the tie tacks and rings and pledge pins
and whatnot, to the brothers at retail and kept the difference for
themselves. The boredom and lassitude of these sentinels of the press
could scarcely be exaggerated.</p>
<p>And on this particular Saturday afternoon there was also Peter
Fallow.</p>
<p>Fallow, by contrast, was fervor personified. Of the various cubicles
around the edges of the city room, his was the only one in use. He was
perched on the edge of his chair with the telephone at his ear and a
Biro in his hand. He was so keyed up, his excitement cut through today’s
hangover with something approaching clarity.</p>
<p>On his desk was a telephone directory for Nassau County, which was on
Long Island. A great hefty thing, it was, this directory. He had never
heard of Nassau County, although he now reckoned he must have passed
through it during the weekend when he had managed to inspire St. John’s
superior at the museum, Virgil Gooch III—the Yanks loved to string Roman
numerals after their sons’ names—to invite him to his ludicrously grand
house by the ocean in East Hampton, Long Island. There was no second
invitation, but…ah, well, ah, well…As for the town of Hewlett, which was
in the county of Nassau, its existence on the face of the earth was news
to him, but somewhere in the town of Hewlett a telephone was ringing,
and he desperately wanted it to be answered. Finally, after seven rings,
it was.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Out of breath.</p>
<p>“Mr. Rifkind?”</p>
<p>“Yes…” Out of breath and wary.</p>
<p>“This is Peter Fallow of the New York City Light.”</p>
<p>“Don’t want any.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me? I do hope you’ll forgive me for ringing you up on a
Saturday afternoon.”</p>
<p>“You hope wrong. I subscribed to the Times once. Actually got it
about once a week.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no, I’m not—”</p>
<p>“Either somebody swiped it from the front door before I left the
house or it was soaking wet or it was never delivered.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m a journalist, Mr. Rifkind. I write for The City Light.”</p>
<p>He finally managed to establish this fact to Mr. Rifkind’s
satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Well, okay,” said Mr. Rifkind, “go ahead. I was just out in the
driveway having a few beers and making a FOR SALE sign to put up in the
window of my car. You’re not by any chance in the market for a 1981
Thunderbird.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid not,” said Fallow with a chortle, as if Mr. Rifkind were
one of the great Saturday-afternoon wits of his experience. “Actually,
I’m calling to inquire about one of your students, a young Mr. Henry
Lamb.”</p>
<p>“Henry Lamb. Doesn’t ring a bell. What’s he done?”</p>
<p>“Oh, he hasn’t done anything. He’s been seriously injured.” He
proceeded to lay out the facts of the case, stacking them rather heavily
toward the Albert Vogel-Reverend Bacon theory of the incident. “I was
told he was a student in your English class.”</p>
<p>“Who told you that?”</p>
<p>“His mother. I had quite a long talk with her. She’s a very nice
woman and very upset, as you can imagine.”</p>
<p>“Henry Lamb…Oh yes, I know who you mean. Well, that’s too bad.”</p>
<p>“What I would like to find out, Mr. Rifkind, is what kind of student
Henry Lamb is.”</p>
<p>“What kind?”</p>
<p>“Well, would you say he was an outstanding student?”</p>
<p>“Where are you from, Mr.—I’m sorry, tell me your name again?”</p>
<p>“Fallow.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Fallow. I gather you’re not from New York.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>“Then there’s no reason why you should know anything about Colonel
Jacob Ruppert High School in the Bronx. At Ruppert we use comparative
terms, but outstanding isn’t one of them. The range runs more from
cooperative to life-threatening.” Mr. Rifkind began to chuckle. “F’r
Chrissake, don’t say I said that.”</p>
<p>“Well, how would you describe Henry Lamb?”</p>
<p>“Cooperative. He’s a nice fellow. Never gives me any trouble.”</p>
<p>“Would you describe him as a good student?”</p>
<p>“Good doesn’t work too well at Ruppert, either. It’s more ‘Does he
attend class or doesn’t he?’”</p>
<p>“Did Henry Lamb attend class?”</p>
<p>“As I recall, yes. He’s usually there. He’s very dependable. He’s a
nice kid, as nice as they come.”</p>
<p>“Was there any part of the curriculum he was particularly good—or,
let me say, adept at, anything he did better than anything else?”</p>
<p>“Not particularly.”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“It’s difficult to explain, Mr. Fallow. As the saying goes, ‘Ex
nihilo ni-hil fit.’ There’s not a great range of activities in these
classes, and so it’s hard to compare performances. These boys and
girls—sometimes their minds are in the classroom, and sometimes they’re
not.”</p>
<p>“What about Henry Lamb?”</p>
<p>“He’s a nice fellow. He’s polite, he pays attention, he doesn’t give
me any trouble. He tries to learn.”</p>
<p>“Well, he must have some abilities. His mother told me he was
considering going to college.”</p>
<p>“That may well be. She’s probably talking about C.C.N.Y. That’s the
City College of New York.”</p>
<p>“I believe Mrs. Lamb did mention that.”</p>
<p>“City College has an open-admissions policy. If you live in New York
City and you’re a high-school graduate and you want to go to City
College, you can go.”</p>
<p>“Will Henry Lamb graduate, or would he have?”</p>
<p>“As far as I know. As I say, he has a very good attendance
record.”</p>
<p>“How do you think he would have fared as a college student?”</p>
<p>A sigh. “I don’t know. I can’t imagine what happens with these kids
when they enter City College.”</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Rifkind, can you tell me anything at all about Henry
Lamb’s performance or his aptitude, anything at all?”</p>
<p>“You have to understand that they give me about sixty-five students
in each class when the year starts, because they know it’ll be down to
forty by mid-year and thirty by the end of the year. Even thirty’s too
many, but that’s what I get. It’s not exactly what you’d call a tutorial
system. Henry Lamb’s a nice young man who applies himself and wants an
education. What more can I tell you?”</p>
<p>“Let me ask you this. How does he do on his written work?”</p>
<p>Mr. Rifkind let out a whoop. “Written work? There hasn’t been any
written work at Ruppert High for fifteen years! Maybe twenty! They take
multiple-choice tests. Reading comprehension, that’s the big thing.
That’s all the Board of Education cares about.”</p>
<p>“How was Henry Lamb’s reading comprehension?”</p>
<p>“I’d have to look it up. Not bad, if I had to guess.”</p>
<p>“Better than most? Or about average? Or what would you say?”</p>
<p>“Well…I know it must be difficult for you to understand, Mr. Fallow,
being from England. Am I right? You’re British?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>
<p>“Naturally—or I guess it’s natural—you’re used to levels of
excellence and so forth. But these kids haven’t reached the level where
it’s worth emphasizing the kind of comparisons you’re talking about.
We’re just trying to get them up to a certain level and then keep them
from falling back. You’re thinking about ‘honor students’ and ‘higher
achievers’ and all that, and that’s natural enough, as I say. But at
Colonel Jacob Ruppert High School, an honor student is somebody who
attends class, isn’t disruptive, tries to learn, and does all right at
reading and arithmetic.”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s use that standard. By that standard, is Henry Lamb an
honor student?”</p>
<p>“By that standard, yes.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, Mr. Rifkind.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay. I’m sorry to hear about all this. Seems like a nice
boy. We’re not supposed to call them boys, but that’s what they are,
poor sad confused boys with a whole lotta problems. Don’t quote me, for
Christ’s sake, or I’ll have a whole lotta problems. Hey, listen. You
sure you couldn’t use a 1981 Thunderbird?”</p>
