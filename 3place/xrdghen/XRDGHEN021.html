<h4 id="the-fabulous-koala">21. The Fabulous Koala</h4>
<p>Never in his life had he seen things, the things of everyday life,
more clearly. And his eyes poisoned every one of them!</p>
<p>In the bank on Nassau Street, which he had entered hundreds of times,
where tellers, guards, junior officers, and the manager himself knew him
as the estimable Mr. McCoy of Pierce andandandand Pierce and called him
by name, where he was so esteemed, in fact, they had given him a
personal loan of .8 million to buy his apartment—and that loan cost him
1,000 a month!—and where was it going to come from!—oh God!—he now
noticed the smallest things…the egg-and-dart molding around the cornice
on the main floor…the old bronze shades on the lamps on the
check-writing desks in the middle of the lobby…the spiral fluting on the
posts supporting the railing between the lobby and the section where the
officers sat…All so solid! so precise! so orderly!…and now so specious!
such a mockery!…so worthless, offering no protection at all…</p>
<p>Everybody smiled at him. Kind respectful unsuspecting souls…Today
still Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy…How very sad to
think that in this solid orderly place…tomorrow…</p>
<p>Ten thousand in cash…Killian said the bail money had to be in
cash…The teller was a young black woman, no more than twenty-five,
wearing a blouse with a high-neck stock and a gold pin…a cloud with a
face blowing the wind…in gold…His eyes fastened upon the strange sadness
of the wind’s face of gold…If he presented her with a check for 0,000,
would she question it? Would he have to go to a bank officer and
explain? What would he say? For bail? The estimable Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy
Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy…</p>
<p>In fact, all she said was “You know we have to report all
transactions of 0,000 or more, don’t you, Mr. McCoy?”</p>
<p>Report? To a bank officer!</p>
<p>She must have seen the puzzlement on his face, because she said, “To
the government. We have to fill out a form.”</p>
<p>Then it dawned on him. It was a regulation designed to foil drug
dealers who did business in large amounts of cash.</p>
<p>“How long does it take? Does it involve a lot of paperwork?”</p>
<p>“No, we just fill out the form. We have all the information we need
on file, your address and so on.”</p>
<p>“Well—all right, that’s fine.”</p>
<p>“How would you like it? In hundreds?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yes, in hundreds.” He didn’t have the faintest idea of what
0,000 in hundred-dollar bills would look like.</p>
<p>She left the window and soon returned with what looked like a small
paper brick with a band of paper around it. “Here you are. This is a
hundred one-hundred-dollar bills.”</p>
<p>He smiled nervously. “That’s it? Doesn’t look like much, does
it?”</p>
<p>“Well…depends. All bills come in packages of a hundred, the ones same
as the hundreds. When you see a hundred on there, it’s impressive
enough, I guess.”</p>
<p>He propped his attaché case up on the marble sill of the window and
snapped open the lid and took the paper brick from her and put it inside
and snapped the case shut and then glanced at her face again. She knew,
didn’t she! She knew there was something sordid about having to take out
such a desperate amount of cash. There was bound to be!</p>
<p>In fact, her face betrayed neither approval nor disapproval. She
smiled, politely, to show her goodwill—and a wave of fear swept over
him. Goodwill! What would she or any other black person who looked into
the face of Sherman McCoy think tomorrow—</p>
<p>—of the man who ran down a black honor student and left him to
die!</p>
<p>As he walked down Nassau, toward Wall, on his way to Dunning Sponget
andandandand Leach, he had an attack of money anxiety. The 0,000 had
pretty well wiped out his checking account. He had another 6,000 or so
in a so-called money market savings account that could be shifted at any
time to the checking account. This was money he kept on hand
for—incidentals!—the ordinary bills that came up every month! and would
keep on coming up!—like waves at the shore—and now what? Very shortly he
would have to invade principal—and there wasn’t that much principal. Had
to stop thinking about it. He thought of his father. He would be there
in five minutes…He couldn’t imagine it. And that would be nothing
compared to Judy and Campbell.</p>
<p>As he walked into his father’s office, his father rose up from the
chair behind his desk…but Sherman’s poisoned eyes picked out the most
insignificant thing…the saddest thing…Just across from his father’s
window, in a window of the new glass-and-aluminum building across the
street, a young white woman was staring at the street below and probing
the intertragian notch of her left ear with a Q-tip…a very plain young
woman with tight curly hair, staring at the street and cleaning her
ears…How very sad…The street was so narrow he felt as if he could reach
out and rap on the plate glass where she stood…The new building had cast
his father’s little office into a perpetual gloom. He had to keep the
lights on at all times. At Dunning Sponget andandandand Leach, old
partners, such as John Campbell McCoy, were not forced to retire, but
they were expected to do the right thing. This meant giving up grand
offices and grand views to make way for the rising middle-agelings,
lawyers in their forties and early fifties still swollen with ambition
and visions of grander views, grander offices.</p>
<p>“Come in, Sherman,” said his father…the erstwhile Lion…with a smile
and also a wary note. No doubt he had been able to tell from the tone of
Sherman’s voice on the telephone that this would not be an ordinary
visit. The Lion…He was still an impressive figure with his aristocratic
chin and his thick white hair combed straight back and his English suit
and his heavy watch chain across the belly of his vest. But his skin
seemed thin and delicate, as if at any moment his entire leonine hide
might crumple inside all the formidable worsted clothes. He motioned
toward the armchair by his desk and said, quite pleasantly, “The bond
market must be in the doldrums. Suddenly I rate a visit in the middle of
the day.”</p>
<p>A visit in the middle of the day—the Lion’s old office had not only
been on the corner, it had commanded a view of New York Harbor. What
bliss it had been, as a boy, to go visit Daddy in his office! From the
moment he stepped off the elevator on the eighteenth floor he was His
Majesty the Child. Everyone, the receptionist, the junior partners, even
the porters, knew his name and sang it out as if nothing could bring
greater happiness to the loyal subjects of Dunning Sponget than the
sight of his little face and budding aristocratic chin. All other
traffic seemed to come to a halt as His Majesty the Child was escorted
down the hall and deep into the CEO’s suite to the office of the Lion
himself, on the corner, where the door opened and—glorious!—the sun
flooded in from over the harbor, which was spread out for him down
below. The Statue of Liberty, the Staten Island ferries, the tugboats,
the police boats, the cargo ships coming in through the Narrows in the
distance…What a show—for him! What bliss!</p>
<p>Several times, in that glorious office, they came close to sitting
down and having a real talk. Young as he was, Sherman had perceived that
his father was trying to open a door in his formality and beckon him
through. And he had never known quite how. Now, in the blink of an eye,
Sherman was thirty-eight, and there was no door at all. How could he put
it? In his entire life he had never dared embarrass his father with a
single confession of weakness, let alone moral decay and abject
vulnerability.</p>
<p>“Well, how’s it going at Pierce andandandand Pierce?”</p>
<p>Sherman laughed a mirthless laugh. “I don’t know. It’s going on
without me. That much I know.”</p>
<p>His father leaned forward. “You’re not leaving?”</p>
<p>“In a manner of speaking.” He still didn’t know how to put it. So,
weakly, guiltily, he fell back on the shock approach, the blunt demand
for sympathy, that had worked with Gene Lopwitz. “Dad, I’m going to be
arrested in the morning.”</p>
<p>His father stared at him for what seemed like a very long time, then
opened his mouth and closed it and sighed a little sigh, as if rejecting
all of mankind’s usual responses of surprise or disbelief when a
disaster is announced. What he finally said, while perfectly logical,
puzzled Sherman: “By whom?”</p>
<p>“By…the police. The New York City police.”</p>
<p>“On what charge?” Such bewilderment and pain on his face. Oh, he had
stunned him, all right, and probably demolished his capacity to get
angry…and how contemptible a strategy it was…</p>
<p>“Reckless endangerment, leaving the scene of an accident, failure to
report an accident.”</p>
<p>“Automobile,” said his father, as if talking to himself. “And they’re
going to arrest you tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Sherman nodded and began his sordid story, all the while studying his
father’s face and noting, with relief and guilt, that he remained
stunned. Sherman dealt with the subject of Maria with Victorian
delicacy. Scarcely knew her. Had only seen her three or four times, in
innocuous situations. Should never have flirted with her, of course.
Flirted.</p>
<p>“Who is this woman, Sherman?”</p>
<p>“She’s married to a man named Arthur Ruskin.”</p>
<p>“Ah. I think I know who you mean. He’s Jewish, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>What earthly difference does it make? “Yes.”</p>
<p>“And who is she?”</p>
<p>“She’s from someplace in South Carolina.”</p>
<p>“What was her maiden name?”</p>
<p>Her maiden name? “Dean. I don’t think she’s Colonial Dames material,
Dad.”</p>
<p>When he got as far as the first appearance of the stories in the
newspapers, Sherman could tell his father didn’t want to hear any more
of the sordid details. He interrupted again.</p>
<p>“Who’s representing you, Sherman? I assume you do have a lawyer.”</p>
<p>“Yes. His name is Thomas Killian.”</p>
<p>“Never heard of him. Who is he?”</p>
<p>With a heavy heart: “He’s with a firm called Dershkin, Bellavita,
Fishbein andandandand Schlossel.”</p>
<p>The Lion’s nostrils quivered, and his jaw muscles bunched up, as if
he were trying to keep from retching. “How on earth did you find
them?”</p>
<p>“They specialize in criminal law. Freddy Button recommended
them.”</p>
<p>“Freddy? You let Freddy…” He shook his head. He couldn’t find the
words.</p>
<p>“He’s my lawyer!”</p>
<p>“I know, Sherman, but Freddy…” The Lion glanced toward the door and
then lowered his voice. “Freddy’s a perfectly fine person, Sherman, but
this is a serious matter!”</p>
<p>“You turned me over to Freddy, Dad, a long time ago!”</p>
<p>“I know!—but not for anything important!” He shook his head some
more. Bewilderment upon bewilderment.</p>
<p>“Well, in any event, I’m represented by a lawyer named Thomas
Killian.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Sherman.” A far-off weariness. The horse is out of the barn. “I
wish you had come to me as soon as this thing happened. Now, at this
stage—well, but that’s where we are, isn’t it? So let’s try to go from
here. One thing I’m quite sure of. You have got to find the very best
representation available. You’ve got to find lawyers you can trust,
implicitly, because you’re putting an awful lot in their hands. You
can’t just go wandering in to some people named Dershbein—whatever it
is. I’m going to call Chester Whitman and Ed LaPrade and sound them
out.”</p>
<p>Chester Whitman and Ed LaPrade? Two old federal judges who were
either retired or close to it. The likelihood of their knowing anything
about the machinations of a Bronx district attorney or a Harlem
rabble-rouser was so remote…And all at once Sherman felt sad, not so
much for himself as for this old man before him, clinging to the power
of connections that meant something back in the 1950s and early
1960s…</p>
<p>“Miss Needleman?” The Lion was already on the telephone. “Would you
ring up Judge Chester Whitman for me, please?…What?…Oh. I see. Well,
when you’re through, then.” He hung up the receiver. As an old partner,
he no longer had a secretary of his own. He shared one with half a dozen
others, and obviously she, Miss Needleman, did not jump when the Lion
opened his mouth. Waiting, the Lion looked out his solitary window and
pursed his lips and looked very old.</p>
<p>And in that moment Sherman made the terrible discovery that men make
about their fathers sooner or later. For the first time he realized that
the man before him was not an aging father but a boy, a boy much like
himself, a boy who grew up and had a child of his own and, as best he
could, out of a sense of duty and, perhaps, love, adopted a role called
Being a Father so that his child would have something mythical and
infinitely important: a Protector, who would keep a lid on all the
chaotic and catastrophic possibilities of life. And now that boy, that
good actor, had grown old and fragile and tired, wearier than ever at
the thought of trying to hoist the Protector’s armor back onto his
shoulders again, now, so far down the line.</p>
<p>The Lion looked away from the window and straight at Sherman and
smiled, with what Sherman interpreted as a kindly embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Sherman,” he said, “promise me one thing. You won’t lose heart. I
wish you’d come to me sooner, but that doesn’t matter. You’re going to
have my complete support, and you’re going to have Mother’s. Whatever we
can do for you, we will.”</p>
<p>For an instant, Sherman thought he was talking about money. On second
thought, he knew he wasn’t. By the standards of the rest of the world,
the world outside of New York, his parents were rich. In fact, they had
just enough to generate the income that would support the house on
Seventy-third Street and the house on Long Island and provide them with
help a few days each week at both places and take care of the routine
expenses that would preserve their gentility. But to cut into their
principal would be like cutting a vein. He couldn’t do that to this
well-meaning gray-haired man who sat before him in this mean little
office. And, for that matter, he wasn’t at all sure that’s what was
being offered.</p>
<p>“What about Judy?” asked his father.</p>
<p>“Judy?”</p>
<p>“How has she taken all this?”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t know about it yet.”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t?”</p>
<p>“Not the first thing.”</p>
<p>Every vestige of an expression left the face of the old gray-haired
lad.</p>
<p>When Sherman asked Judy to come with him into the library, he had
every intention, every conscious intention, of being completely honest.
But from the moment he opened his mouth he was aware of his clumsy
secret para-self, the dissembler. It was the dissembler who put that
portentous baritone into his voice and who showed Judy to the wing chair
the way a funeral director might have done it and who closed the door to
the library with lugubrious deliberateness and then turned about and
wrapped his eyebrows around his nose so that Judy could see, without
hearing the first word, that the situation was grave.</p>
<p>The dissembler didn’t sit behind his desk—that would be too corporate
a posture—but in the armchair. And then he said:</p>
<p>“Judy, I want you to get a grip on yourself. I—”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to tell me about your little whatever it is, don’t
bother. You can’t imagine how uninterested I am.”</p>
<p>Astounded: “My little what?”</p>
<p>“Your…affair…if that’s what it is. I don’t even want to hear about
it.”</p>
<p>He stared at her with his mouth slightly open, ransacking his mind
for something to say: “That’s only part of it”…“If only that’s all it
was”…“I’m afraid you’ll have to hear about it”…“It’s gone beyond
that”…All so lame, flat—so he fell back on the bomb. He’d drop the bomb
on her.</p>
<p>“Judy—I’m going to be arrested in the morning.”</p>
<p>That got her. That knocked the condescending look off her face. Her
shoulders dropped. She was just a little woman in a big chair.</p>
<p>“Arrested?”</p>
<p>“You remember the night the two detectives came by here. The thing
that happened in the Bronx?”</p>
<p>“That was you?”</p>
<p>“It was me.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe it!”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately it’s true. It was me.”</p>
<p>He had her. She was staggered. He felt cheap and guilty all over
again. The dimensions of his catastrophe once more hogged the moral
terrain.</p>
<p>He started in on his story. Until the very words came out of his
mouth, he meant to be completely truthful about Maria. But…what good
would it do? Why devastate his wife completely? Why leave her with a
completely hateful husband? So he told her it had been just a little
flirtation. Known the woman barely three weeks.</p>
<p>“I just told her I’d pick her up at the airport. I just all of a
sudden told her I’d do that. I probably had—I guess I had something on
my mind—won’t try to kid you or kid myself—but, Judy, I swear to you, I
never even kissed the woman, much less had an affair. Then this
unbelievable thing happened, this nightmare, and I haven’t seen her
since except that one night when all of a sudden there I am sitting next
to her at the Bavardages’. Judy, I swear to you, there was no
affair.”</p>
<p>He studied her face to see if by any chance she believed him. A
blank. A daze. He plunged on.</p>
<p>“I know I should have told you as soon as the thing happened. But it
came right on top of that stupid telephone call I made. And then I knew
you’d think I was having some kind of affair, which I wasn’t. Judy, I’ve
seen the woman maybe five times in my life, always in a public
situation. I mean, even picking somebody up at an airport is a public
situation.”</p>
<p>He halted and tried to size her up again. Nothing. He found her
silence overwhelming. He felt compelled to supply all the missing
words.</p>
<p>He went on about the newspaper stories, his problems at the office,
about Freddy Button, Thomas Killian, Gene Lopwitz. Even as he droned on
about one thing, his mind raced ahead to the next. Should he tell her
about his conversation with his father? That would win him her sympathy,
because she would realize the pain it caused him. No! She might be angry
to know he had told his father first…But before he reached that point,
he realized she was no longer listening. A curious, almost dreamy look
had come over her face. Then she started chuckling. The only sound that
came out was a little cluck cluck cluck in her throat.</p>
<p>Shocked and offended: “This strikes you as funny?”</p>
<p>With just a trace of a smile: “I’m laughing at myself. All weekend I
was upset because you were such a…dud…at the Bavardages’. I was afraid
that might hurt my chances of being chairman of the museum benefit.”</p>
<p>Despite everything, Sherman was pained to learn that he had been a
dud at the Bavardages’.</p>
<p>Judy said, “That’s pretty funny, isn’t it? Me worrying about the
museum benefit?”</p>
<p>With a hiss: “Sorry to be a drag on your ambitions.”</p>
<p>“Sherman, now I want you to listen to me.” She said it with such a
calm maternal kindness, it was eerie. “I’m not responding like a good
wife, am I. I want to. But how can I? I want to offer you my love, or if
not my love, my…what?…my sympathy, my closeness, my comfort. But I
can’t. I can’t even pretend. You haven’t let me near you. Do you
understand that? You haven’t let me near you. You have deceived me,
Sherman. Do you know what that means, to deceive someone?” She said this
with the same maternal kindness as the rest.</p>
<p>“Deceive? Good Lord, it was a flirtation, if it was anything. If
you…make eyes at somebody…you can call that deceit if you want, but I
wouldn’t call it that.”</p>
<p>She put on the slight smile again and shook her head. “Sherman,
Sherman, Sherman.”</p>
<p>“I swear that’s the truth.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know what you did with your Maria Ruskin, and I don’t
care. I just don’t. That’s the least of it, but I don’t think you
understand that.”</p>
<p>“The least of what?”</p>
<p>“What you’ve done to me, and not just to me. To Campbell.”</p>
<p>“Campbell!”</p>
<p>“To your family. We are a family. This thing, this thing affecting
all of us, it happened two weeks ago, and you said nothing about it. You
hid it from me. You sat right next to me, in this very room, and watched
that news report, the demonstration, and you didn’t say a word. Then the
police came to our home—the police!—to our home!—I even asked you why
you were in such a state, and you pretended it was a coincidence. And
then—that same night—you sat next to your…your friend…your
accomplice…your sidekick…you tell me what to call her…and you still said
nothing. You let me think nothing was wrong. You let me go on having my
foolish dreams, and you let Campbell go on having her childish dreams,
of being a normal little girl in a normal family, playing with her
little friends, making her little rabbits and turtles and penguins. The
night the world was learning of your escapade, Campbell was showing you
a rabbit she made out of clay. Do you remember that? Do you? And you
just looked at it and said all the right things! And now you come
home”—all at once her eyes were full of tears—“at the end of the day and
you tell me…you’re…gonna…be…arrested…in…the…morning.”</p>
<p>The sentence was gulped down in sobs. Sherman stood up. Should he try
to put his arms around her? Or would it only make it worse? He took a
step toward her.</p>
<p>She sat up straight and held her hands up before her in a very
delicate, tentative way.</p>
<p>“Don’t,” she said softly. “Just listen to what I’m telling you.” Her
cheeks were streaked with tears. “I’m going to try to help you, and I’m
going to try to help Campbell, in any way I can. But I can’t give you my
love, and I can’t give you tenderness. I’m not that good an actress. I
wish I were, because you’re going to need love and tenderness,
Sherman.”</p>
<p>Sherman said, “Can’t you forgive me?”</p>
<p>“I suppose I could,” she said. “But what would that change?”</p>
<p>He had no answer.</p>
<p>He spoke to Campbell in her bedroom. Just walking in was enough to
break his heart. Campbell was sitting at her table (a round table with
about eight hundred dollars’ worth of flowered cotton fabric from Laura
Ashley hanging to the floor and a piece of beveled glass costing 80
covering the top) or, rather, she was halfway on top of it, with her
head close to the surface, in an attitude of intense concentration,
printing some letters with a big pink pencil. It was the perfect little
girl’s room. Dolls and stuffed animals were perched everywhere. They
were on the white-enameled bookcases with their ribbed pilasters and on
the pair of miniature boudoir chairs (more flowered fabric from Laura
Ashley). They were perched up against the ribbon-back Chippendale
headboard of the bed and the ribbon-back footboard and upon the lacy and
carefully thought-out clutter of pillows and on the pair of round
bedside tables with another fortune in fabric falling to the floor.
Sherman had never begrudged a cent of the stupendous sums of money Judy
had put into this one room, and he certainly did not now. His heart was
lacerated by the thought that he now had to find the words to tell
Campbell that the dream world of this room was finished, many years too
soon.</p>
<p>“Hi, sweetheart, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Without looking up: “I’m writing a book.”</p>
<p>“Writing a book! That’s wonderful. What’s it about?”</p>
<p>Silence; without looking up; hard at work.</p>
<p>“Sweetie, I want to talk to you about something, something very
important.”</p>
<p>She looked up. “Daddy, can you make a book?”</p>
<p>Make a book? “Make a book? I’m not sure what you mean.”</p>
<p>“Make a book!” A bit exasperated by his denseness.</p>
<p>“You mean actually make one? No, they do that at a factory.”</p>
<p>“MacKenzie’s making one. Her dad is helping her. I want to make
one.”</p>
<p>Garland Reed and his damnable so-called books. Avoiding the issue:
“Well, first you have to write your book.”</p>
<p>Big smile: “I writed it!” She gestured toward the piece of paper on
the table.</p>
<p>“You wrote it?” He never corrected her mistakes in grammar
directly.</p>
<p>“Yes! Will you help me make a book?”</p>
<p>Helplessly, sadly: “I’ll try.”</p>
<p>“You want to read it?”</p>
<p>“Campbell, there’s something very important I want to talk to you
about. I want you to listen very carefully to what I tell you.”</p>
<p>“You want to read it?”</p>
<p>“Campbell—” A sigh; helpless against her single-mindedness. “Yes. I’d
love to read it.”</p>
<p>Modestly: “It’s not very long.” She picked up several pieces of paper
and handed them to him.</p>
<p>In large, careful letters:</p>
<p>The Koala</p>
<p>by Campbell McCoy</p>
<p>There was once a koala. His name was Kelly. He lived in the woods.
Kelly had lots of friends. One day someone went on a hike and ate
Kelly’s food.</p>
<p>He was very sad. He wanted to see the city. Kelly went to the city.
He also wanted to see bildings. As soon as he was about to get hold of a
nob to open a door, a dog rushed by! But he did not get Kelly. Kelly
jumped in a window. And by mistake he pressed the alarm. Then the polees
cars were zooming by. Kelly was scared. Kelly finly escaped.</p>
<p>Someone caught Kelly and brought him to the zoo. Now Kelly loves the
zoo.</p>
<p>Sherman’s skull seemed to fill with steam. It was about himself! For
an instant he wondered if in some inexplicable way she had
divined…picked up the sinister emanations…if it were somehow in the very
air of their home…By mistake he pressed the alarm. Then the police cars
were zooming by!…It couldn’t be…and yet there it was!</p>
<p>“You like it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, uh…I, uh…”</p>
<p>“Daddy! You like it?”</p>
<p>“It’s wonderful, darling. You’re very talented…Not many girls your
age—not many…it’s wonderful…”</p>
<p>“Now will you help me make the book?”</p>
<p>“I—there’s something I have to tell you, Campbell. Okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay. You really like it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s wonderful. Campbell, I want you to listen to me. Okay?
Now, Campbell, you know that people don’t always tell the truth about
other people.”</p>
<p>“The truth?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes people say bad things, things that aren’t true.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes people say bad things about other people, things they
shouldn’t say, things that make the other person feel bad. Do you know
what I mean?”</p>
<p>“Daddy, should I draw a picture of Kelly for the book?”</p>
<p>Kelly? “Please listen to me, Campbell. This is important.”</p>
<p>“Ohhhh-kayyy.” Weary sigh.</p>
<p>“Do you remember one time MacKenzie said something that wasn’t nice
about you, something that wasn’t true?”</p>
<p>“MacKenzie?” Now he had her attention.</p>
<p>“Yes. Remember, she said you…” For the life of him, he couldn’t
remember what MacKenzie had said. “I think she said you weren’t her
friend.”</p>
<p>“MacKenzie’s my best friend, and I’m her best friend.”</p>
<p>“I know. That’s just the point. She said something that wasn’t true.
She didn’t mean it, but she said it, and sometimes people do that. They
say things that hurt other people, and maybe they don’t mean to do it,
but they do it, and it hurts the other person, and that’s not the right
thing to do.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Plowing on: “It isn’t just children. Sometimes it’s grown-ups.
Grown-ups can be mean like that, too. In fact, they can be worse. Now,
Campbell, I want you to listen to me. There are some people who are
saying very bad things about me, things that aren’t true.”</p>
<p>“They are?”</p>
<p>“Yes. They’re saying I hit a boy with my car and hurt him badly.
Please look at me, Campbell. Now, that isn’t true. I didn’t do any such
thing, but there are bad people who are saying that, and you may hear
people say that, but all you have to know is, it isn’t true. Even if
they say it’s true, you know it isn’t true.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you tell them it isn’t true?”</p>
<p>“I will, but these people may not want to believe me. There are bad
people who want to believe bad things about other people.”</p>
<p>“But why don’t you tell them?”</p>
<p>“I will. But these bad people are going to put these bad things in
the newspaper and on television, and so people are going to believe
them, because they will read it in the newspapers and see it on
television. But it isn’t true. And I don’t care what they think, but I
do care what you think, because I love you, Campbell, I love you very
much, and I want you to know that your daddy is a good person who didn’t
do what these people are saying.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be in the newspaper? You’ll be on television?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid so, Campbell. Probably tomorrow. And your friends at
school may say something to you about it. But you mustn’t pay any
attention to them, because you’ll know that what’s in the newspaper and
on television isn’t true. Don’t you, sweetie?”</p>
<p>“Does that mean you’ll be famous?”</p>
<p>“Famous?”</p>
<p>“Will you be in history, Daddy?”</p>
<p>History? “No, I won’t be in history, Campbell. But I’ll be smeared,
vilified, dragged through the mud.”</p>
<p>He knew she wouldn’t understand a word of it. It just popped out,
prodded by the frustration of trying to explain the press to a
six-year-old.</p>
<p>Something in his face she understood well enough. With great
seriousness and tenderness she looked into his eyes and said:</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Daddy. I love you.”</p>
<p>“Campbell—”</p>
<p>He took her in his arms and buried his head on her shoulder to hide
his tears.</p>
<p>There was once a koala and a pretty little room where soft sweet
creatures lived and slept the trusting sleep of the innocent, and now
there was none.</p>
