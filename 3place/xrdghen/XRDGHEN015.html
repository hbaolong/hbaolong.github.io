<h4 id="the-masque-of-the-red-death">15. The Masque of the Red
Death</h4>
<p>Sherman and Judy arrived at the Bavardages’ building on Fifth Avenue
in a black Buick sedan, with a white-haired driver, hired for the
evening from Mayfair Town Car, Inc. They lived only six blocks from the
Bavardages, but walking was out of the question. For a start, there was
Judy’s dress. It was bare-shouldered but had short puffed sleeves the
size of Chinese lampshades covering the upper arms. It had a fitted
waist but was puffed up in the skirt to a shape that reminded Sherman of
an aerial balloon. The invitation to dinner at the Bavardages’
prescribed “informal” dress. But this season, as tout le monde knew,
women dressed far more extravagantly for informal dinners in fashionable
apartments than for formal dances in grand ballrooms. In any event, it
was impossible for Judy to walk down the street in this dress. A
five-mile-an-hour head wind would have stopped her cold.</p>
<p>But there was a yet more compelling reason for the hired car and
driver. It would be perfectly okay for the two of them to arrive for
dinner at a Good Building (the going term) on Fifth Avenue by taxi, and
it would cost less than three dollars. But what would they do after the
party? How could they walk out of the Bavardages’ building and have all
the world, tout le monde, see them standing out in the street, the
McCoys, that game couple, their hands up in the air, bravely,
desperately, pathetically trying to hail a taxi? The doormen would be no
help because they would be tied up ushering tout le monde to their
limousines. So he had hired this car and this driver, this white-haired
driver, who would drive them six blocks, wait three and a half or four
hours, then drive them six blocks and depart. Including a 15 percent tip
and the sales tax, the cost would be 97.20 or 46.50, depending on
whether they were charged for four or five hours in all.</p>
<p>Hemorrhaging money! Did he even have a job left! Churning
fear…Lopwitz…Surely, Lopwitz wouldn’t sack him…because of three
miserable days…and million, you ninny!…Must start cutting
back…tomorrow…Tonight, of course, it was imperative to have a car and
driver.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the driver couldn’t pull up to the sidewalk
near the entrance, because so many limousines were in the way. He had to
double-park. Sherman and Judy had to thread their way between the
limousines…Envy…envy…From the license plates Sherman could tell that
these limousines were not hired. They were owned by those whose sleek
hides were hauled here in them. A chauffeur, a good one willing to work
long hours and late hours, cost 6,000 a year, minimum; garage space,
maintenance, insurance, would cost another 4,000 at least; a total of
0,000, none of it deductible. I make a million dollars a year—and yet I
can’t afford that!</p>
<p>He reached the sidewalk. Whuh? Just to the left, in the gloaming, a
figure—a photographer—right over there—</p>
<p>Sheer terror!</p>
<p>My picture in the paper!</p>
<p>The other boy, the big one, the brute, sees him and goes to the
police!</p>
<p>The police! The two detectives! The fat one! The one with the
lopsided face! McCoy—goes to parties at the Bavardages’, does he! Now
they truly smell blood!</p>
<p>Horrified, he stares at the photographer—</p>
<p>—and discovers that it’s only a young man walking a dog. He has
stopped near the canopy that leads up to the entrance…Not even looking
at Sherman…staring at a couple who are nearing the door…an old man in a
dark suit and a young woman, a blonde, in a short dress.</p>
<p>Calm down, for God’s sake! Don’t be crazy! Don’t be paranoid!</p>
<p>But a smirking, insulting voice says: You got something you wanna get
off your chest?</p>
<p>Now Sherman and Judy were under the canopy, only three or four steps
behind the old man and the blonde, heading for the entrance. A doorman
in a starched white dickie pushed it open. He wore white cotton gloves.
The blonde entered first. The old man, who was not much taller than she
was, looked sleepy and somber. His thinning gray hair was combed
straight back. He had a big nose and heavy eyelids, like a movie Indian.
Wait a minute—I know him…No, he had seen him somewhere…But
where?…Bango!…In a picture, of course…It was Baron Hochswald, the German
financier.</p>
<p>This was all Sherman needed, on this night of all nights…After the
catastrophes of the past three days, in this perilous low point of his
career on Wall Street, to run into this man, whose success was so
complete, so permanent, whose wealth was so vast and unassailable—to
have to set eyes upon this immovably secure and ancient German—</p>
<p>Perhaps the baron merely lived in this building…Please, God, don’t
let him be going to the same dinner party—</p>
<p>In that very moment he heard the baron say to the doorman in a heavy
European accent: “Bavardage.” The doorman’s white glove gestured toward
the rear of the lobby.</p>
<p>Sherman despaired. He despaired of this evening and of this life. Why
hadn’t he gone to Knoxville six months ago? A little Georgian house, a
leaf-blowing machine, a badminton net in the backyard for Campbell…But
no! He had to tag along behind this walnut-eyed German, heading for the
home of some overbearingly vulgar people named Bavardage, a glorified
traveling salesman and his wife.</p>
<p>Sherman said to the doorman, “The Bavardages’, please.” He hit the
accented syllable hard, so that no one would think he had paid the
slightest attention to the fact that the noble one, Baron Hochswald, had
said the same thing. The baron, the blonde, Judy, and Sherman headed for
the elevator. The elevator was paneled in old mahogany. It glowed. The
grain was showy but rich and mellow. As he entered, Sherman overheard
Baron Hochswald saying the name Bavardage to the operator. So Sherman
repeated it, as before, “The Bavardages’”—lest the baron himself get the
impression that he, Sherman, was cognizant of his existence.</p>
<p>Now all four of them knew they were going to the same dinner party,
and they had to make a decision. Did you do the decent, congenial,
neighborly, and quite American thing—the sort of thing that would have
been done without hesitation on an elevator in a similar building on
Beacon Hill or Rittenhouse Square—or in a building in New York, for that
matter, if the party were being given by someone of good blood and good
bone, such as Rawlie or Pollard (in the present company, Pollard
suddenly seemed quite okay, quite a commendable old Knickerbocker)—did
you do the good-spirited thing and smile and introduce yourselves to one
another…or did you do the vulgar snobbish thing and stand there and
pretend you were unaware of your common destination and stare stiffly at
the back of the elevator operator’s neck while this mahogany cab rose up
its shaft?</p>
<p>Sherman cut an exploratory glance at Hochswald and the blonde. Her
dress was a black sheath that ended several inches above her knees and
hugged her luscious thighs and the lubricious declivity of her lower
abdomen and rose up to a ruff at the top that resembled flower petals.
Christ, she was sexy! Her creamy white shoulders and the tops of her
breasts swelled up as if she was dying to shed the sheath and run naked
through the begonias…Her blond hair was swept back to reveal a pair of
enormous ruby earrings…No more than twenty-five years old…A tasty
morsel! A panting animal!…The old bastard had taken what he wanted,
hadn’t he!…Hochswald wore a black serge suit, a white shirt with a
spread collar, and a black silk necktie with a large, almost rakish
knot…all of it fashioned just so…Sherman was glad Judy had pressured him
into wearing the navy suit and navy tie…Nevertheless, the baron’s
ensemble seemed terribly smart by comparison.</p>
<p>Now he caught the old German flicking his eyes up and down Judy and
himself. Their glances engaged for the briefest of instants. Then both
stared once more at the piping on the back of the collar of the elevator
operator.</p>
<p>So they ascended, an elevator operator and four social mutes, toward
some upper floor. The answer was: You did the vulgar snobbish thing.</p>
<p>The elevator stopped, and the four mutes walked out into the
Bavardages’ elevator vestibule. It was lit by clusters of tiny silk
lampshades on either side of a mirror with a gilded frame. There was an
open doorway…a rich and rosy glow…the sound of a hive of excited
voices…</p>
<p>They went through the doorway, into the apartment’s entry gallery.
Such voices! Such delight! Such laughter! Sherman faced catastrophe in
his career, catastrophe in his marriage—and the police were circling—and
yet the hive—the hive!—the hive!—the sonic waves of the hive made his
very innards vibrate. Faces full of grinning, glistening, boiling teeth!
How fabulous and fortunate we are, we few, to be in these upper rooms
together with our radiant and incarnadine glows!</p>
<p>The entry gallery was smaller than Sherman’s, but whereas his
(decorated by his wife, the interior designer) was grand and solemn,
this one was dazzling, effervescent. The walls were covered in a
brilliant Chinese-red silk, and the silk was framed by narrow gilded
moldings, and the moldings were framed by a broad burnt-umber
upholsterer’s webbing, and the webbing was framed by more gilded
moldings, and the light of a row of brass sconces made the gilt gleam,
and the glow of the gilt and the Chinese-red silk made all the grinning
faces and lustrous gowns yet more glorious.</p>
<p>He surveyed the crowd and immediately sensed a pattern…presque vu!
presque vu! almost seen!…and yet he couldn’t have put it into words.
That would have been beyond him. All the men and women in this hall were
arranged in clusters, conversational bouquets, so to speak. There were
no solitary figures, no strays. All faces were white. (Black faces might
show up, occasionally, at fashionable charity dinners but not in
fashionable private homes.) There were no men under thirty-five and
precious few under forty. The women came in two varieties. First, there
were women in their late thirties and in their forties and older (women
“of a certain age”), all of them skin and bones (starved to near
perfection). To compensate for the concupiscence missing from their
juiceless ribs and atrophied backsides, they turned to the dress
designers. This season no puffs, flounces, pleats, ruffles, bibs, bows,
battings, scallops, laces, darts, or shirrs on the bias were too
extreme. They were the social X-rays, to use the phrase that had bubbled
up into Sherman’s own brain. Second, there were the so-called Lemon
Tarts. These were women in their twenties or early thirties, mostly
blondes (the Lemon in the Tarts), who were the second, third, and fourth
wives or live-in girlfriends of men over forty or fifty or sixty (or
seventy), the sort of women men refer to, quite without thinking, as
girls. This season the Tart was able to flaunt the natural advantages of
youth by showing her legs from well above the knee and emphasizing her
round bottom (something no X-ray had). What was entirely missing from
chez Bavardage was that manner of women who is neither very young nor
very old, who has laid in a lining of subcutaneous fat, who glows with
plumpness and a rosy face that speaks, without a word, of home and
hearth and hot food ready at six and stories read aloud at night and
conversations while seated on the edge of the bed, just before the
Sandman comes. In short, no one ever invited…Mother.</p>
<p>Sherman’s attention was drawn to a bouquet of ecstatic boiling faces
in the immediate foreground. Two men and an impeccably emaciated woman
were grinning upon a huge young man with pale blond hair and a cowlick
at the top of his forehead…Met him somewhere…but who is
he?…Bango!…Another face from the press…The Golden Hillbilly, the
Towheaded Tenor…That was what they called him…His name was Bobby
Shaflett. He was the new featured tenor of the Metropolitan Opera, a
grossly fat creature who had somehow emerged from the upland hollows of
the Appalachians. You could hardly read a magazine or a newspaper
without seeing his picture. As Sherman watched, the young man’s mouth
opened wide. Haw haw haw haw haw haw haw haw haw, he broke out into a
huge barnyard laugh, and the grinning faces around him became even more
radiant, more transported, than before.</p>
<p>Sherman lifted his Yale chin, squared his shoulders, straightened his
back, raised himself to his full height, and assumed the Presence, the
presence of an older, finer New York, the New York of his father, the
Lion of Dunning Sponget.</p>
<p>A butler materialized and asked Judy and Sherman what they wanted to
drink. Judy asked for “sparkling water.” (To say “Perrier” or any other
brand name had become too trite.) Sherman had intended to drink nothing.
He had intended to be aloof from everything about these people, these
Bavardages, starting with their liquor. But the hive had closed in, and
the cowlicked towhead of the Golden Hillbilly boomed away.</p>
<p>“A gin-and-tonic,” said Sherman McCoy from the eminence of his
chin.</p>
<p>A blazing bony little woman popped out from amid all the clusters in
the entry gallery and came toward them. She was an X-ray with a teased
blond pageboy bob and many tiny grinning teeth. Her emaciated body was
inserted into a black-and-red dress with ferocious puffed shoulders, a
very narrow waist, and a long skirt. Her face was wide and round—but
without an ounce of flesh on it. Her neck was much more drawn than
Judy’s. Her clavicle stuck out so far Sherman had the feeling he could
reach out and pick up the two big bones. He could see lamplight through
her rib cage.</p>
<p>“Dear Judy!”</p>
<p>“Inez!” said Judy, and the two of them kissed or, rather, swung their
cheeks past one another, first on this side, then on that side, in a
European fashion that Sherman, now the son of that staunch
Knickerbocker, that Old Family patriarch, that Low Church Episcopal
scourge of the fleshpots, John Campbell McCoy, found pretentious and
vulgar.</p>
<p>“Inez! I don’t think you’ve met Sherman!” She forced her voice into
an exclamation, in order to be heard above the hive, “Sherman, this is
Inez Bavardage!”</p>
<p>“Howja do,” said the Lion’s scion.</p>
<p>“I certainly feel like I know you!” said the woman, looking him
squarely in the eye and flashing her tiny teeth and thrusting her hand
toward him. Overwhelmed, he took it. “You should hear Gene Lopwitz go on
about you!” Lopwitz! When? Sherman found himself clutching at this rope
of hope. (Perhaps he had built up so many points in the past, the
Giscard debacle would not finish him!) “And I know your father, too.
Scared to death of him!” With this the woman gripped Sherman’s forearm
and fastened her eyes onto his and broke into an extraordinary laugh, a
hacking laugh, not hah hah hah but hack hack hack hack hack hack hack
hack hack, a laugh of such heartiness and paroxysmal rapture that
Sherman found himself grinning foolishly and saying:</p>
<p>“You don’t say!”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Hack hack hack hack hack hack hack. “I never told you this,
Judy!” She reached out and hooked one arm inside Judy’s and the other
inside Sherman’s and pulled the two of them toward her, as if they were
the two dearest chums she had ever had. “There was this dreadful man
named Derderian who was suing Leon. Kept trying to attach things. Pure
harassment. So one weekend we were out on Santa Catalina Island at Angie
Civelli’s.” She dropped the name of the famous comedian without so much
as a syncopation. “And we’re having dinner, and Leon starts talking
about all the trouble he’s having with this man Derderian, and Angie
says—believe me, he was absolutely serious—he says, ‘You want me to take
care of it?’” With this, Inez Bavardage pushed her nose to one side with
her forefinger to indicate the Bent-Nose Crowd. “Well, I mean I’d heard
about Angie and The Boys, but I didn’t believe it—but he was serious!”
Hack hack hack hack hack hack hack hack. She pulled Sherman yet closer
and put her eyes right in his face. “When Leon got back to New York, he
went to see your father, and he told him what Angie had said, and then
he said to your father, ‘Maybe that’s the simplest way to take care of
it.’ I’ll never forget what your father said. He said, ‘No,
Mr. Bavardage, you let me take care of it. It won’t be simple, it won’t
be fast, and it’ll cost you a lot of money. But my bill you can pay. The
other—no one is rich enough to pay them. They’ll keep collecting until
the day you die.’”</p>
<p>Inez Bavardage remained close to Sherman’s face and gave him a look
of bottomless profundity. He felt obliged to say something.</p>
<p>“Well…which did your husband do?”</p>
<p>“What your father said, of course. When he spoke—people jumped!” A
hack-hack-hack-hacking peeeealllll of laughter.</p>
<p>“And what about the bill?” asked Judy, as if delighted to be in on
this story about Sherman’s incomparable father.</p>
<p>“It was sensational! It was astonishing, that bill!” Hack hack hack
hack hack. Vesuvius, Krakatoa, and Mauna Loa erupted with laughter, and
Sherman felt himself swept up in the explosion, in spite of himself. It
was irresistible—Gene Lopwitz loves you!—your incomparable father!—your
aristocratic lineage!—what euphoria you arouse in my bony breast!</p>
<p>He knew it was irrational, but he felt warm, aglow, high, in Seventh
Heaven. He eased the revolver of his Resentment back into his waistband
and told his Snobbery to go lie down by the hearth. Really a very
charming woman! Who would have thought it, after all the things one
hears about the Bavardages! A social X-ray, to be sure, but one can’t
very well hold that against her! Really very warm—and quite amusing!</p>
<p>Like most men, Sherman was innocent of the routine salutatory
techniques of the fashionable hostesses. For at least forty-five seconds
every guest was the closest, dearest, jolliest, most wittily
conspiratorial friend a girl ever had. Every male guest she touched on
the arm (any other part of the body presented problems) and applied a
little heartfelt pressure. Every guest, male or female, she looked at
with a radar lock upon the eyes, as if captivated (by the brilliance,
the wit, the beauty, and the incomparable memories).</p>
<p>The butler returned with the drinks for Judy and Sherman, Sherman
took a long deep draught of the gin-and-tonic, and the gin hit bottom,
and the sweet juniper rose, and he relaxed and let the happy buzz of the
hive surge into his head.</p>
<p>Hack hack hack hack hack hack hack went Inez Bavardage.</p>
<p>Haw haw haw haw haw haw haw haw went Bobby Shaflett.</p>
<p>Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah went Judy.</p>
<p>Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh went Sherman.</p>
<p>The hive buzzed and buzzed.</p>
<p>In no time Inez Bavardage had steered him and Judy over to the
bouquet where the Golden Hillbilly held forth. Nods, hellos, handshakes,
under the aegis of Sherman’s new best friend, Inez. Before he quite
realized what had happened, Inez had steered Judy out of the entry
gallery, into some inner salon, and Sherman was left with the celebrated
Appalachian fat boy, two men, and an X-ray. He looked at each of them,
starting with Shaflett. None returned his gaze. The two men and the
woman stared, rapt, at the huge pale head of the tenor as he recounted a
story of something that had happened on an airplane:</p>
<p>“—so I’m settin’up’eh waitin’ fuh Barb’ra—she’s supposed to be ridin’
back to New York with me?” He had a way of ending a declarative sentence
with a question that reminded Sherman of Maria…Maria…and the huge
Hasidic Jew! The great blond ball of fat before him was like that huge
sow from the real-estate company—if that was where he was from. A cold
tremor…They were out there circling, circling…“And I’m in my seat—I got
the one by the window? And from back’eh, here come ’is unbelievable,
outrageous black man.” The way he hit the un and the out and fluttered
his hands in the air made Sherman wonder if this hillbilly giant was, in
fact, a homosexual. “He’s wearin’ this’eh ermine overcoat?—down to
here?—and ’is’eh matchin’ ermine fedora?—and he’s got more rings’n
Barb’ra’s got, and he’s got three retainers with ’im?—right outta
Shaft?”</p>
<p>The giant bubbled on, and the two men and the woman kept their eyes
on his huge round face and their grins fixed; and the giant, for his
part, looked only at them, never at Sherman. As the seconds rolled by,
he grew increasingly aware that all four of them were acting as if he
didn’t exist. A giant fairy with a hillbilly accent, thought Sherman,
and they were hanging on his every word. Sherman took three deep gulps
of his gin-and-tonic.</p>
<p>The story seemed to revolve about the fact that the regal black man,
who had sat down next to Shaflett on the airplane, was the
cruiser-weight champion of the world, Sam (Assassin Sam) Assinore.
Shaflett found the term “cruiser weight” vastly amusing—haw haw haw haw
haw haw haw—and the two men went into excited screams of laughter.
Sherman labeled them homosexual, too. Assassin Sam hadn’t known who
Shaflett was, and Shaflett hadn’t known who Assassin Sam was. The point
of the entire story seemed to be that the only two people in the
first-class section of the airliner who hadn’t known who both these
celebrities were…were Shaflett and Assinore themselves! Haw haw haw haw
haw haw haw haw—hee hee hee hee hee hee hee—and—aha!—a conversational
nugget about Assassin Sam Assinore popped into Sherman’s brain. Oscar
Suder—Oscar Suder!—he winced at the memory but pressed on—Oscar Suder
was part of a syndicate of Midwestern investors who backed Assinore and
controlled his finances. A nugget! A conversational nugget! A means of
entry into this party cluster!</p>
<p>As soon as the laughter had receded, Sherman said to Bobby Shaflett,
“Did you know that Assinore’s contract, and his ermine coat, for all I
know, is owned by a syndicate of businessmen in Ohio, mostly from
Cleveland and Columbus?”</p>
<p>The Golden Hillbilly looked at him as if he were a panhandler.
“Hmmmmmmmm,” he said. It was the hmmmmmmmm that says, “I understand, but
I couldn’t care less,” whereupon he turned back to the other three and
said, “So I asked him if he’d sign my menu. You know, they give you this
menu?—and—”</p>
<p>That was all for Sherman McCoy. He pulled the revolver of Resentment
back out of his waistband. He wheeled away from the cluster and turned
his back on them. Not one of them noticed. The hive raged in his
head.</p>
<p>Now what would he do? All at once he was alone in this noisy hive
with no place to roost. Alone! He became acutely aware that the entire
party was now composed of these bouquets and that not to be in one of
them was to be an abject, incompetent social failure. He looked this way
and that. Who was that, right there? A tall, handsome, smug-looking
man…admiring faces looking up at his…Ah!…It registered…an author…His
name was Nunnally Voyd…a novelist…he’d seen him on a television talk
show…snide, acerbic…Look at the way those fools doted on him…Didn’t dare
try that bouquet…Would be a repeat of the Golden Hillbilly, no
doubt…Over there, someone he knew…No! Another famous face…the ballet
dancer…Boris Korolev…Another circle of adoring faces…glistening with
rapture…The idiots! Human specks! What is this business of groveling
before dancers, novelists, and gigantic fairy opera singers? They’re
nothing but court jesters, nothing but light entertainment for…the
Masters of the Universe, those who push the levers that move the
world…and yet these idiots worship them as if they were pipelines to the
godhead…They didn’t even want to know who he was…and wouldn’t even be
capable of understanding, even if they had…</p>
<p>He found himself standing by another cluster…Well, at least no one
famous in this one, no smirking court jester…A fat, reddish man was
talking, in a heavy British accent: “He was lying in the road, you see,
with a broken leg…” The delicate skinny boy! Henry Lamb! He was talking
about the story in the newspaper! But wait a minute—a broken leg—“…and
he kept saying, ‘How very boring, how very boring.’” No, he was talking
about some Englishman. Nothing to do with me…The others in the cluster
were laughing…a woman, about fifty, with pink powder all over her
face…How grotesque…Wait!…He knew that face. The sculptor’s daughter, now
a stage designer. He couldn’t remember her name…But then he did…Barbara
Cornagglia…He moved on…Alone!…Despite all, despite the fact that they
were circling—the police!—he felt the pressure of social failure…What
could he do to make it appear as if he meant to be by himself, as if he
were moving through the hive alone by choice? The hive buzzed and
buzzed.</p>
<p>Near the doorway through which Judy and Inez Bavardage had
disappeared was an antique console bearing a pair of miniature Chinese
easels. Upon each easel was a burgundy velvet disk the size of a pie,
and in slits in the velvet, little pockets, were stuck name cards. They
were models of the seating arrangement for dinner, so that each guest
would know who his dinner partners were going to be. It struck Sherman,
the leonine Yale man, as another piece of vulgarity. Nevertheless, he
looked. It was a way of appearing occupied, as if he were alone for no
other reason than to study the seating arrangement.</p>
<p>There were evidently two tables. Presently he saw a card with
Mr. McCoy on it. He would be sitting next to, let’s see, a
Mrs. Rawthrote, whoever she might be, and a Mrs. Ruskin. Ruskin! His
heart bolted. It couldn’t be—not Maria!</p>
<p>But of course it could be. This was precisely the sort of event to
which she and her rich but somewhat shadowy husband would be invited. He
downed the rest of his gin-and-tonic and hurried through the doorway
into the other room. Maria! Had to talk to her!—but also had to keep
Judy away from her! Don’t need that on top of everything else!</p>
<p>He was now in the apartment’s living room, or salon, since it was
obviously meant for entertaining. It was enormous, but it appeared to
be…stuffed…with sofas, cushions, fat chairs, and hassocks, all of them
braided, tasseled, banded, bordered and…stuffed…Even the walls; the
walls were covered in some sort of padded fabric with stripes of red,
purple, and rose. The windows overlooking Fifth Avenue were curtained in
deep folds of the same material, which was pulled back to reveal its
rose lining and a trim of striped rope braid. There was not so much as a
hint of the twentieth century in the decor, not even in the lighting. A
few table lamps with rosy shades provided all the light, so that the
terrain of this gloriously stuffed little planet was thrown into deep
shadows and mellow highlights.</p>
<p>The hive buzzed with the sheer ecstasy of being in this mellow rosy
stuffed orbit. Hack hack hack hack hack hack, the horse laugh of Inez
Bavardage rose somewhere. So many bouquets of people…grinning
faces…boiling teeth…A butler appeared and asked him if he wanted a
drink. He ordered another gin-and-tonic. He stood there. His eyes jumped
around the deep stuffed shadows.</p>
<p>Maria.</p>
<p>She was standing by one of the two corner windows. Bare shoulders…a
red sheath…She caught his eye and smiled. Just that, a smile. He
answered with the smallest smile imaginable. Where was Judy?</p>
<p>In Maria’s cluster was a woman he didn’t recognize, a man he didn’t
recognize, and a bald-headed man he knew from somewhere, another of
the…famous faces this zoo specialized in…a writer of some sort, a
Brit…He couldn’t think of his name. Completely bald; not a hair on his
long thin head; gaunt; a skull.</p>
<p>Sherman panned the room, desperately searching for Judy. Well, what
difference would it make if Judy did meet someone in this room named
Maria? It wasn’t that unusual a name. But would Maria be discreet? She
was no genius, and she had a mischievous streak—and he was supposed to
sit next to her!</p>
<p>He could feel his heart kicking up in his chest. Christ! Was it
possible that Inez Bavardage knew about the two of them and put them
together on purpose? Wait a minute! That’s very paranoid! She’d never
risk having an ugly scene. Still—</p>
<p>Judy.</p>
<p>There she was, standing over near the fireplace, laughing so hard her
new party laugh—wants to be an Inez Bavardage—laughing so hard her hair
was bouncing. She was making a new sound, hock hock hock hock hock hock
hock. Not yet Inez Bavardage’s hack hack hack hack, just an intermediary
hock hock hock hock. She was listening to a barrel-chested old man with
receding gray hair and no neck. The third member of the bouquet, a
woman, elegant, slim, and fortyish, was not nearly so amused. She stood
like a marble angel. Sherman made his way through the hive, past the
knees of some people sitting down on a huge round Oriental hassock,
toward the fireplace. He had to push his way through a dense flotilla of
puffed gowns and boiling faces…</p>
<p>Judy’s face was a mask of mirth. She was so enthralled by the
conversation of the barrel-chested man she didn’t notice Sherman at
first. Then she saw him. Startled! But of course!—it was a sign of
social failure for one spouse to be reduced to joining another in a
conversational cluster. But so what! Keep her away from Maria! That was
the main thing. Judy didn’t look at him. Once again she beamed her
grinning rapture at the old man.</p>
<p>“—so last week,” he was saying, “my wife comes back from Italy and
informs me we have a summer place on ‘Como.’ ‘Como,’ she says. It’s this
Lake Como. So all right! We’ll have a summer place on ‘Como.’ It’s
better than Hammamet. That was two summers ago.” He had a rough voice, a
brushed-up New York street voice. He was holding a glass of soda water
and looking back and forth, from Judy to the marble angel, as he told
his story, getting vast effusions of approval from Judy and the
occasional wriggle of the upper lip when he looked directly into the
angel’s face. A wriggle; it could have been the beginning of a polite
smile. “At least I know where ‘Como’ is. I never hearda Hammamet. My
wife’s gone gaga about Italy. Italian paintings, Italian clothes, and
now ‘Como.’”</p>
<p>Judy went off into another automatic-weapon burst of laughter, Hock
hock hock hock hock hock, as if the way the old man pronounced “Como,”
in mockery of his wife’s love of things Italian, was the funniest thing
in the world—Maria. It came over him, just like that. It was Maria he
was talking about. This old man was her husband, Arthur Ruskin. Had he
mentioned her by name yet, or had he been talking only about “my
wife”?</p>
<p>The other woman, marble angel, just stood there. The old man suddenly
reached toward her left ear and took her earring between his thumb and
forefinger. Appalled, the woman stiffened. She would have jerked her
head away, but her ear was now between the thumb and forefinger of this
ancient and appalling ursine creature.</p>
<p>“Very nice,” said Arthur Ruskin, still holding on to the earring.
“Nadina D., right?” Nadina Dulocci was a highly mentionable jewelry
designer.</p>
<p>“I believe so!” said the woman in a timorous, European voice.
Hurriedly she brought her hands to her ears and unfastened both earrings
and handed them to him, most emphatically, as if to say, “There, take
them. But be so kind as not to rip my ears off my head.”</p>
<p>Unconcerned, Ruskin took them in his hairy paws and inspected them
further. “Nadina D., all right. Very nice. Where’d you get ’em?”</p>
<p>“They were a gift.” Cold as marble. He returned them to her, and she
quickly put them in her purse.</p>
<p>“Very nice, very nice. My wife—”</p>
<p>Suppose he said “Maria”! Sherman broke in. “Judy!” To the others:
“Excuse me.” To Judy: “I was wondering—”</p>
<p>Judy instantly transformed her startled expression into one of
radiance. No wife in all of history had ever been more charmed to see
her husband arrive at a conversational bouquet.</p>
<p>“Sherman! Have you met Madame Prudhomme?”</p>
<p>Sherman extended his Yale chin and put on an expression of the most
proper Knickerbocker charm to greet the shaken Frenchwoman. “Howja
do?”</p>
<p>“And Arthur Ruskin,” said Judy. Sherman shook the hairy mitt
firmly.</p>
<p>Arthur Ruskin was not a young seventy-one. He had big ears with thick
rinds and wire hairs sprouting out. There were curdled wattles under his
big jaws. He stood erectly, rocking back on his heels, which brought out
his chest and his ponderous gut. His heft was properly swathed in a navy
suit, white shirt, and navy tie.</p>
<p>“Forgive me,” said Sherman. To Judy, with a charming smile: “Come
over here a moment.” To Ruskin and the Frenchwoman he flashed a smile of
apology and moved off a few feet, Judy in tow. Madame Prudhomme’s face
fell. She had looked to his arrival in the bouquet as a salvation from
Ruskin.</p>
<p>Judy, with a fireproof smile still on her face: “What is it?”</p>
<p>Sherman, a smiling mask of Yale Chin charm: “I want you to…uh…to come
meet Baron Hochswald.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“Baron Hochswald. You know, the German—one of the Hochwalds.”</p>
<p>Judy, the smile still locked on: “But why?”</p>
<p>“We rode up in the elevator with him.”</p>
<p>This obviously made no sense to Judy at all. Urgently: “Well, where
is he?” Urgently, because it was bad enough to be caught in a large
conversational cluster with your husband. To form a minimal cluster with
him, just the two of you—</p>
<p>Sherman, looking around: “Well, he was here just a minute ago.”</p>
<p>Judy, the smile gone: “Sherman, what on earth are you doing? What are
you talking about, ‘Baron Hochswald’?”</p>
<p>Just then the butler arrived with Sherman’s gin-and-tonic. He took a
big swallow and looked around some more. He felt dizzy.
Everywhere…social X-rays in puffed dresses shimmering in the
burnt-apricot glow of the little table lamps…</p>
<p>“Well—you two! What are you trying to cook up!” Hack hack hack hack
hack hack hack. Inez Bavardage took them both by their arms. For a
moment, before she could get her fireproof grin back onto her face, Judy
looked stricken. Not only had she ended up in a minimal cluster with her
husband, but New York’s reigning hostess, this month’s ring-mistress of
the century, had spotted them and felt compelled to make this ambulance
run to save them from social ignominy.</p>
<p>“Sherman was—”</p>
<p>“I was looking for you! I want you to meet Ronald Vine. He’s doing
over the Vice President’s house, in Washington.”</p>
<p>Inez Bavardage towed them through the hive of grins and gowns and
inserted them in a bouquet dominated by a tall, slender, handsome,
youngish man, the aforesaid Ronald Vine. Mr. Vine was saying, “…jabots,
jabots, jabots. I’m afraid the Vice President’s wife has discovered
jabots.” A weary roll of the eyes. The others in the bouquet, two women
and a bald man, laughed and laughed. Judy could barely summon up even a
smile…Crushed…Had to be rescued from social death by the hostess…</p>
<p>Such sad irony! Sherman hated himself. He hated himself for all the
catastrophes she didn’t yet know about.</p>
<p>The Bavardages’ dining room walls had been painted with so many coats
of burnt-apricot lacquer, fourteen in all, they had the glassy
brilliance of a pond reflecting a campfire at night. The room was a
triumph of nocturnal reflections, one of many such victories by Ronald
Vine, whose forte was the creation of glitter without the use of
mirrors. Mirror Indigestion was now regarded as one of the gross sins of
the 1970s. So in the early 1980s, from Park Avenue to Fifth, from
Sixty-second Street to Ninety-sixth, there had arisen the hideous
cracking sound of acres of hellishly expensive plate-glass mirror being
pried off the walls of the great apartments. No, in the Bavardages’
dining room one’s eyes fluttered in a cosmos of glints, twinkles,
sparkles, highlights, sheens, shimmering pools, and fiery glows that had
been achieved in subtler ways, by using lacquer, glazed tiles in a
narrow band just under the ceiling cornices, gilded English Regency
furniture, silver candelabra, crystal bowls, School of Tiffany vases,
and sculpted silverware that was so heavy the knives weighed on your
fingers like saber handles.</p>
<p>The two dozen diners were seated at a pair of round Regency tables.
The banquet table, the sort of Sheraton landing field that could seat
twenty-four if you inserted all the leaves, had disappeared from the
smarter dining rooms. One shouldn’t be so formal, so grand. Two small
tables were much better. So what if these two small tables were
surrounded and bedecked by a buildup of objets, fabrics, and bibelots so
lush it would have made the Sun King blink? Hostesses such as Inez
Bavardage prided themselves on their gift for the informal and the
intimate.</p>
<p>To underscore the informality of the occasion there had been placed,
in the middle of each table, deep within the forest of crystal and
silver, a basket woven from hardened vines in a highly rustic
Appalachian Handicrafts manner. Wrapped around the vines, on the outside
of the basket, was a profusion of wildflowers. In the center of the
basket were massed three or four dozen poppies. This faux-naïf
centerpiece was the trademark of Huck Thigg, the young florist, who
would present the Bavardages with a bill for ,300 for this one dinner
party.</p>
<p>Sherman stared at the plaited vines. They looked like something
dropped by Gretel or little Heidi of Switzerland at a feast of Lucullus.
He sighed. All…too much. Maria was sitting next to him, on his right,
chattering away at the cadaverous Englishman, whatever his name was, who
was on her right. Judy was at the other table—but had a clear view of
him and Maria. He had to talk to Maria about the interrogation by the
two detectives—but how could he do it with Judy looking right at them?
He’d do it with an innocuous party grin on his face. That was it! He’d
grin through the whole discussion! She’d never know the difference…Or
would she?…Arthur Ruskin was at Judy’s table…But thank God, he was four
seats away from her…wouldn’t be chatting with her…Judy was sitting
between Baron Hochswald and some rather pompous-looking youngish
man…Inez Bavardage was two seats away from Judy, and Bobby Shaflett was
on Inez’s right. Judy was grinning an enormous social grin at the
pompous man…Hock hock hock hock hock hock hock hock hock hock! Clear
above the buzz of the hive he could hear her laughing her new laugh…Inez
was talking to Bobby Shaflett but also to the grinning social X-ray
seated to the Golden Hillbilly’s right and to Nunnally Voyd, who was to
the right of the X-ray. Haw haw haw haw haw haw haw, sang the Towheaded
Tenor…Hack hack hack hack hack hack, sang Inez Bavardage…Hock hock hock
hock hock hock hock hock hock, bawled his own wife…</p>
<p>Leon Bavardage sat four chairs to Sherman’s right, beyond Maria, the
cadaverous Englishman, and the woman with the pink powder on her face,
Barbara Cornagglia. In contrast to Inez Bavardage, Leon had all the
animation of a raindrop. He had a placid, passive, lineless face, wavy
blondish hair, which was receding, a long delicate nose, and very pale,
almost livid skin. Instead of a 300-watt social grin, he had a shy,
demure smile, which he was just now bestowing upon Miss Cornagglia.</p>
<p>Belatedly it occurred to Sherman that he should be talking to the
woman on his left. Rawthrote, Mrs. Rawthrote; who in the name of God was
she? What could he say to her? He turned to his left—and she was
waiting. She was staring straight at him, her laser eyes no more than
eighteen inches from his face. A real X-ray with a huge mane of blond
hair and a look of such intensity he thought at first that she must know
something…He opened his mouth…he smiled…he ransacked his brain for
something to say…he did the best he could…He said to her, “Would you do
me a great favor? What is the name of the gentleman to my right, the
thin gentleman? His face is so familiar, but I can’t think of his name
for the life of me.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Rawthrote leaned still closer, until their faces were barely
eight inches apart. She was so close she seemed to have three eyes.
“Aubrey Buffing,” she said. Her eyes kept burning into his.</p>
<p>“Aubrey Buffing,” said Sherman lamely. It was really a question.</p>
<p>“The poet,” said Mrs. Rawthrote. “He’s on the short list for the
Nobel Prize. His father was the Duke of Bray.” Her tone said, “How on
earth could you not know that?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Sherman, feeling that in addition to his other sins
he was also a philistine. “The poet.”</p>
<p>“How do you think he looks?” She had eyes like a cobra’s. Her face
remained right in his. He wanted to pull back but couldn’t. He felt
paralyzed.</p>
<p>“Looks?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Lord Buffing,” she said. “The state of his health.”</p>
<p>“I—can’t really say. I don’t know him.”</p>
<p>“He’s being treated at Vanderbilt Hospital. He has AIDS.” She pulled
back a few inches, the better to see how this zinger hit Sherman.</p>
<p>“That’s terrible!” said Sherman. “How do you know that?”</p>
<p>“I know his best boyfriend.” She closed her eyes and then opened
them, as if to say: “I know such things, but don’t ask too many
questions.” Then she said, “This is entre nous.” But I’ve never met you
before! “Don’t tell Leon or Inez,” she continued. “He’s their house
guest—has been for the past two and a half weeks. Never invite an
Englishman for a weekend. You can’t get them out.” She said this without
smiling, as if it was the most serious advice she had ever offered free
of charge. She continued her myopic study of Sherman’s face.</p>
<p>In order to break eye contact, Sherman took a quick glance at the
gaunt Englishman, Lord Buffing the Short-List Poet.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” said Mrs. Rawthrote. “You can’t get it at the table.
If you could, we’d all have it by now. Half the waiters in New York are
gay. You show me a happy homosexual, I’ll show you a gay corpse.” She
repeated this mot farouche in the same rat-tat-tat voice as everything
else, without a trace of a smile.</p>
<p>Just then a good-looking young waiter, Latin in appearance, began
serving the first course, which looked like an Easter egg under a heavy
white sauce on a plateau of red caviar resting on a bed of Bibb
lettuce.</p>
<p>“Not these,” said Mrs. Rawthrote, right in front of the young man.
“They work full-time for Inez and Leon. Mexicans, from New Orleans. They
live in their place in the country and drive in to serve dinner
parties.” Then, without any preamble, she said, “What do you do,
Mr. McCoy?”</p>
<p>Sherman was taken aback. He was speechless. He was as flabbergasted
as he had been when Campbell asked the same question. A nonentity, a
thirty-five-year-old X-ray, and yet…I want to impress her! The possible
answers came thundering through his mind…I’m a senior member of the bond
division at Pierce andandandand Pierce…No…makes it sound as if he’s a
replaceable part in a bureaucracy and proud to be one…I’m the number one
producer…No…sounds like something a vacuum-cleaner salesman would
say…There’s a group of us who make the major decisions…No…not accurate
and an utterly gauche observation…I made 80,000 selling bonds last
year…That was the true heart of the matter, but there was no way to
impart such information without appearing foolish…I’m—a Master of the
Universe!…Dream on!—and besides, there’s no way to utter it!…So he said,
“Oh, I try to sell a few bonds for Pierce andandandand Pierce.” He
smiled ever so slightly, hoping the modesty of the statement would be
taken as a sign of confidence to burn, thanks to tremendous and
spectacular achievements on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rawthrote lasered in on him again. From six inches away: “Gene
Lopwitz is one of our clients.”</p>
<p>“Your client?”</p>
<p>“At Benning and Sturtevant.”</p>
<p>Where? He stared at her.</p>
<p>“You do know Gene,” she said.</p>
<p>“Well, yes, I work with him.”</p>
<p>Evidently the woman did not find that convincing. To Sherman’s
astonishment, she turned ninety degrees, without another word, to her
left, where a jolly, florid, red-faced man was talking to the Lemon Tart
who had arrived with Baron Hochswald. Sherman now realized who he was…a
television executive named Rale Brigham. Sherman stared at
Mrs. Rawthrote’s bony vertebrae, where they popped up from out of her
gown…Perhaps she had turned away for only a moment and would turn back
to resume their conversation…But no…she had barged in on the
conversation of Brigham and the Tart…He could hear her rat-tat-tat
voice…She was leaning in on Brigham…lasering in…She had devoted all the
time she cared to devote…to a mere bond salesman!</p>
<p>He was stranded again. To his right, Maria was still deep in
conversation with Lord Buffing. He was facing social death once more. He
was a man sitting utterly solo at a dinner table. The hive buzzed all
around him. Everyone else was in a state of social bliss. Only he was
stranded. Only he was a wallflower with no conversational mate, a social
light of no wattage whatsoever in the Bavardage Celebrity Zoo…My life is
coming apart!—and yet through everything else in his overloaded central
nervous system burned the shame—the shame!—of social incompetence.</p>
<p>He stared at Huck Thigg’s hardened vines in the center of the table,
as if a student of floral arrangements. Then he put a smirk on his face,
as if confidently amused. He took a deep gulp of wine and looked across
to the other table, as if he had caught the eye of someone there…He
smiled…He murmured soundlessly toward vacant spots on the wall. He drank
some more wine and studied the hardened vines some more. He counted the
vertebrae in Mrs. Rawthrote’s backbone. He was happy when one of the
waiters, one of the varones from the country, materialized and refilled
his glass of wine.</p>
<p>The main course consisted of slices of pink roast beef brought in on
huge china platters, with ruffs of stewed onions, carrots, and potatoes.
It was a simple, hearty American main course. Simple Hearty American
main courses, insinuated between exotically contrived prologues and
epilogues, were comme il faut, currently, in keeping with the informal
mode. When the Mexican waiter began hoisting the huge platters over the
shoulders of the diners, so that they could take what they wanted, that
served as the signal to change conversational partners. Lord Buffing,
the stricken English poet, entre nous, turned toward the powdered Madame
Cornagglia. Maria turned toward Sherman. She smiled and looked deeply
into his eyes. Too deeply! Suppose Judy should look at them right now!
He put on a frozen social grin.</p>
<p>“Whew!” said Maria. She rolled her eyes in the direction of Lord
Buffing. Sherman didn’t want to talk about Lord Buffing. He wanted to
talk about the visit from the two detectives. But best start off slowly,
in case Judy is looking.</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s right!” he said. A great social grin. “I forgot. You
don’t care for Brits.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s not that,” said Maria. “He seems like a nice man. I could
hardly understand what he was saying. You never heard such an
accent.”</p>
<p>Social grin: “What did he talk about?”</p>
<p>“The purpose of life. I’m not kidding.”</p>
<p>Social grin: “Did he happen to mention what it is?”</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, he did. Reproduction.”</p>
<p>Social grin: “Reproduction?”</p>
<p>“Yes. He said id’d taken him seventy years to realize that’s the sole
purpose of life: reproduction. Said, ‘Nature is concerned with but one
thing: reproduction for the sake of reproduction.’”</p>
<p>Social grin: “That’s very interesting, coming from him. You know he’s
homosexual, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Aw, come on. Who told you that?”</p>
<p>“This one.” He gestured toward the back of Mrs. Rawthrote. “Who is
she, anyhow? Do you know her?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Sally Rawthrote. She’s a real-estate broker.”</p>
<p>Social grin: “A real-estate broker!” Dear God. Who on earth would
invite a real-estate broker to dinner!</p>
<p>As if reading his mind, Maria said, “You’re behind the times,
Sherman. Real-estate brokers are very chic now. She goes everywhere with
that old red-faced tub over there, Lord Gutt.” She nodded toward the
other table.</p>
<p>“The fat man with the British accent?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Who is he?”</p>
<p>“Some banker or other.”</p>
<p>Social grin: “I’ve got something to tell you, Maria, but—I don’t want
you to get excited. My wife is at the next table and she’s facing us. So
please be cool.”</p>
<p>“Well, well, well. Why, Mr. McCoy, honey.”</p>
<p>Keeping the social grin clamped on his mug the whole time, Sherman
gave her a quick account of his confrontation with the two
policemen.</p>
<p>Just as he feared, Maria’s composure broke. She shook her head and
scowled. “Well, why didn’t you let ’em see the goddamned car, Sherman!
You said it’s clean!”</p>
<p>Social grin: “Hey! Calm down! My wife may be looking. I wasn’t
worried about the car. I just didn’t want them to talk to the attendant.
It may be the same one who was there that night, when I brought the car
back.”</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ, Sherman. You talk to me about being cool, and you’re
so uncool. You sure you didn’t tell ’em anything?”</p>
<p>Social grin: “Yes, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>“For Christ’s sake, get that stupid smile off your face. You’re
allowed to have a serious conversation with a girl at the dinner table,
even if your wife is looking. I don’t know why you agreed to talk to the
goddamned police in the first place.”</p>
<p>“It seemed like the right thing to do at the time.”</p>
<p>“I told you you weren’t cut out for this.”</p>
<p>Clamping the social grin back on, Sherman glanced at Judy. She was
busy grinning toward the Indian face of Baron Hochswald. He turned back
to Maria, still grinning.</p>
<p>“Oh, for God’s sake,” said Maria.</p>
<p>He turned off the grin. “When can I talk to you? When can I see
you?”</p>
<p>“Call me tomorrow night.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Tomorrow night. Let me ask you something. Have you heard
anybody talking about the story in The City Light? Anybody here,
tonight?”</p>
<p>Maria started laughing. Sherman was glad. If Judy was watching, it
would appear they were having an amusing conversation. “Are you
serious?” said Maria. “The only thing these people read in The City
Light is her column.” She motioned toward a large woman across the
table, a woman of a certain age with an outrageous mop of blond hair and
false eyelashes so long and thick she could barely lift her upper
lids.</p>
<p>Social grin: “Who’s that?”</p>
<p>“That’s ‘The Shadow.’”</p>
<p>Sherman’s heart kicked up. “You’re joking! They invite a newspaper
columnist to dinner?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Don’t worry. She id’n interested in you. And she id’n
interested in automobile accidents in the Bronx, either. If I shot
Arthur, she’d be interested in that. And I’d be glad to oblige her.”</p>
<p>Maria launched into a denunciation of her husband. He was consumed
with jealousies and resentments. He was making her life hell. He kept
calling her a whore. Her face was becoming more and more contorted.
Sherman was alarmed—Judy might be looking! He wanted to put his social
grin back on, but how could he, in the face of this lamentation? “I
mean, he goes around the apartment calling me a whore. ‘You whore! You
whore!’—right in front of the servants! How do you think that feels? If
he calls me that one more time, I’m gonna hit him over the head with
something, I swear to God!”</p>
<p>Out of the corner of his eye, Sherman could see Judy’s face turned
toward the two of them. Oh Christ!—and him without his grin on! Quickly
he retrieved it and clamped it on his face and said to Maria, “That’s
terrible! It sounds like he’s senile.”</p>
<p>Maria stared at his pleasant social visage for a moment, then shook
her head. “Go to hell, Sherman. You’re as bad as he is.”</p>
<p>Startled, Sherman kept the grin on and let the sound of the hive
engulf him. Such ecstasy on all sides! Such radiant eyes and fireproof
grins! So many boiling teeth! Hack hack hack hack hack hack hack, Inez
Bavardage’s laugh rose in social triumph. Haw haw haw haw haw haw haw
haw haw, the Golden Hillbilly’s barnyard bray rose in response. Sherman
gulped down another glass of wine.</p>
<p>The dessert was apricot soufflé, prepared individually, for each
diner, in a stout little crock of the Normandy sort, with borders au
rustaud painted by hand near the rim. Rich desserts were back in fashion
this season. The sort of dessert that showed you were conscious of
calories and cholesterol, all the berries and melon balls with dollops
of sherbet, had become just a bit Middle America. On top of that, to be
able to serve twenty-four individual soufflés was a tour de force. It
required quite a kitchen and a staff and a half.</p>
<p>Once the tour de force had run its course, Leon Bavardage rose to his
feet and tapped on his wineglass—a glass of sauterne of a deep rosy
golden hue—heavy dessert wines were also comme il faut this season—and
was answered by the happy drunken percussion of people at both tables
tapping their wineglasses in a risory fashion. Haw haw haw haw, Bobby
Shaflett’s laugh rang out. He was banging his glass for all he was
worth. Leon Bavardage’s red lips spread across his face, and his eyes
crinkled, as if the crystal percussion was a great tribute to the joy
the assembled celebrities found in his home.</p>
<p>“You are all such dear and special friends of Inez’s and mine that we
don’t need a special occasion to want to have you all around us in our
home,” he said in a bland, slightly feminine, Gulf Coast drawl. Then he
turned toward the other table, where Bobby Shaflett sat. “I mean,
sometimes we ask Bobby to come over just so we can listen to his laugh.
Bobby’s laugh is music, far as I’m concerned—besides, we never can get
him to sing for us, even when Inez plays the piano!”</p>
<p>Hack hack hack hack hack hack hack hack went Inez Bavardage. Haw haw
haw haw haw haw haw haw, the Golden Hillbilly drowned her out with a
laugh of his own. It was an amazing laugh, this one. Haw haw haww hawww
hawwww hawwwww hawwwwww, it rose and rose and rose, and then it began to
fall in a curious, highly stylized way, and then it broke into a sob.
The room froze—dead silence—for that instant it took the diners, or most
of them, to realize they had just heard the famous laughing sob of the
“Vesti la giubba” aria from Pagliacci.</p>
<p>Tremendous applause from both tables, beaming grins, laughter, and
cries of “More! More! More!”</p>
<p>“Aw, naw!” said the great blond giant. “I only sing for my supper,
an’ at’s enough for supper right’eh! My soufflé wud’n big enough,
Leon!”</p>
<p>Storms of laughter, more applause. Leon Bavardage motioned languidly
toward one of the Mexican waiters. “More soufflé for Mr. Shaflett!” he
said. “Make it in the bathtub!” The waiter stared back with a face of
stone.</p>
<p>Grinning, eyes glistening, swept up by this duet of the great wits,
Rale Brigham yelled out, “Bootleg soufflé!” This was so lame, Sherman
was pleased to note, that everyone ignored it, even the ray-eyed
Mrs. Rawthrote.</p>
<p>“But this is a special occasion, all the same,” said Leon Bavardage,
“because we have a very special friend as our guest during his visit to
the United States, Aubrey Buffing.” He beamed toward the great man, who
turned his gaunt face toward Leon Bavardage with a small tight wary
smile. “Now, last year our friend Jacques Prudhomme”—he beamed toward
the French Minister of Culture, who was to his right—“told Inez and me
he had it on good authority—I hope I’m not speaking out of turn,
Jacques—”</p>
<p>“I hope so, too,” said the Minister of Culture in his grave voice,
shrugging in an exaggerated fashion for humorous effect. Appreciative
laughter.</p>
<p>“Well, you did tell Inez and me you had it on good authority that
Aubrey had won the Nobel Prize. I’m sorry, Jacques, but your
intelligence operations are not so hot in Stockholm!”</p>
<p>Another grand shrug, more of the elegant sepulchral voice:
“Fortunately, we do not contemplate hostilities with Sweden, Leon.”
Great laughter.</p>
<p>“But Aubrey was that close, anyway,” said Leon, putting his
forefinger and thumb close together, “and next year may be his year.”
The old Englishman’s small tight smile didn’t budge. “But of course, it
really doesn’t matter, because what Aubrey means to our…our culture…goes
way beyond prizes, and I know that what Aubrey means to Inez and me as a
friend…well, it goes beyond prizes and culture…and—” He was stumped for
a way to finish off his tricolon, and so he said: “—and everything else.
Anyway, I want to propose a toast to Aubrey, with best wishes for his
visit to America—”</p>
<p>“He just bought himself another month of house guest,” Mrs. Rawthrote
said to Rale Brigham in a stage whisper.</p>
<p>Leon lifted his glass of sauterne: “Lord Buffing!”</p>
<p>Raised glasses, applause, British-style hear-hears.</p>
<p>The Englishman rose slowly to his feet. He was terribly haggard. His
nose seemed a mile long. He was not tall, and yet somehow his great
hairless skull made him seem imposing.</p>
<p>“You’re much too kind, Leon,” he said, looking at Leon and then
casting his eyes down modestly. “As you may know…anyone who entertains
the notion of the Nobel Prize is advised to act as if he is oblivious of
its very existence, and in any case, I’m far too old to worry about
it…And so I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Light
puzzled laughter. “But one can scarcely help being aware of the
marvelous friendship and hospitality of you and Inez, and thank goodness
I don’t have to pretend for a moment to be otherwise.” The litotes had
now trebled so rapidly, the company was baffled. But they murmured their
encouragement. “So much so,” he went on, “that I, for one, should be
happy to sing for my supper—”</p>
<p>“I should think so,” whispered Mrs. Rawthrote.</p>
<p>“—but I don’t see how anyone would dare do so after Mr. Shaflett’s
remarkable allusion to Canio’s grief in Pagliacci.”</p>
<p>As only the English can do it, he pronounced “Mr. Shaflett” very
archly, to bring out the ludicrous aspect of giving the dignified title
“Mister” to this rustic clown.</p>
<p>Suddenly he stopped and lifted his head and gazed straight ahead, as
if looking through the walls of the building and out upon the metropolis
beyond. He laughed dryly.</p>
<p>“Forgive me. All at once I was hearing the sound of my own voice, and
it occurred to me that I now have the sort of British voice which, had I
heard it half a century ago, when I was a young man—a delightfully
hotheaded young man, as I recall—would have caused me to leave the
room.”</p>
<p>People cut glances at one another.</p>
<p>“But I know you won’t leave,” Buffing continued. “It has always been
wonderful to be an Englishman in the United States. Lord Gutt may
disagree with me”—he pronounced Gutt with such a guttural bark, it was
as if he were saying Lord Shithead—“but I doubt that he will. When I
first came to the United States, as a young man, before the Second Great
War, and people heard my voice, they would say, ‘Oh, you’re English!’
and I always got my way, because they were so impressed. Nowadays, when
I come to the United States and people hear my voice, they say, ‘Oh,
you’re English—you poor thing!’—and I still get my way, because your
countrymen never fail to take pity on us.”</p>
<p>Much appreciative laughter and relief. The old man was mining the
lighter vein. He paused again, as if trying to decide whether he should
go on or not. His conclusion, evidently, was yes.</p>
<p>“Why I’ve never written a poem about the States I really don’t know.
Well, I take that back. I do know, of course. I have lived in a century
in which poets are not supposed to write poems about anything, at least
not anything you can put a geographical name to. But the United States
deserve an epic poem. At various times in my career I considered writing
an epic, but I didn’t do that, either. Poets are also not supposed to
write epics any longer, despite the fact that the only poets who have
endured and will endure are poets who have written epics. Homer, Virgil,
Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Spenser—where will Mr. Eliot or
Mr. Rimbaud”—pronounced like Mr. Shaflett—“be in their light, even
twenty-five years from now? In the shadows, I’m afraid, in the
footnotes, deep in the ibid. thickets…along with Aubrey Buffing and a
lot of other poets I have thought very highly of from time to time. No,
we poets no longer even have the vitality to write epics. We don’t even
have the courage to make rhymes, and the American epic should have
rhymes, rhyme on top of rhyme in a shameless cascade, rhymes of the sort
that Edgar Allan Poe gave us…Yes…Poe, who lived his last years just
north of here, I believe, in a part of New York called the Bronx…in a
little cottage with lilacs and a cherry tree…and a wife dying of
tuberculosis. A drunk he was, of course, perhaps a psychotic—but with
the madness of prophetic vision. He wrote a story that tells all we need
to know about the moment we live in now…‘The Masque of the Red Death’…A
mysterious plague, the Red Death, is ravaging the land. Prince
Prospero—Prince Prospero—even the name is perfect—Prince Prospero
assembles all the best people in his castle and lays in two years’
provision of food and drink, and shuts the gates against the outside
world, against the virulence of all lesser souls, and commences a masked
ball that is to last until the plague has burnt itself out beyond the
walls. The party is endless and seamless, and it takes place in seven
grand salons, and in each the revel becomes more intense than in the one
before, and the revelers are drawn on, on, on toward the seventh room,
which is appointed entirely in black. One night, in this last room,
appears a guest shrouded in the most clever and most hideously beautiful
costume this company of luminous masqueraders has ever seen. This guest
is dressed as Death, but so convincingly that Prospero is offended and
orders him ejected. But none dares touch him, so that the task is left
to the Prince himself, and the moment he touches the ghastly shroud, he
falls down dead, for the Red Death has entered the house of
Prospero…Prospero, my friends…Now, the exquisite part of the story is
that somehow the guests have known all along what awaits them in this
room, and yet they are drawn irresistibly toward it, because the
excitement is so intense and the pleasure is so unbridled and the gowns
and the food and the drink and the flesh are so sumptuous—and that is
all they have. Families, homes, children, the great chain of being, the
eternal tide of chromosomes mean nothing to them any longer. They are
bound together, and they whirl about one another, endlessly, particles
in a doomed atom—and what else could the Red Death be but some sort of
final stimulation, the ne plus ultra? So Poe was kind enough to write
the ending for us more than a hundred years ago. Knowing that, who can
possibly write all the sunnier passages that should come before? Not I,
not I. The sickness—the nausea—the pitiless pain—have ceased with the
fever that maddened my brain—with the fever called ‘Living’ that burned
in my brain. The fever called ‘Living’—those were among the last words
he wrote…No…I cannot be the epic poet you deserve. I am too old and far
too tired, too weary of the fever called ‘Living,’ and I value your
company too much, your company and the whirl, the whirl, the whirl.
Thank you, Leon. Thank you, Inez.”</p>
<p>And with that the spectral Englishman slowly took his seat.</p>
<p>The intruder the Bavardages dreaded most, silence, now commanded the
room. The diners looked at one another in embarrassment, three kinds of
it. They were embarrassed for this old man, who had committed the gaffe
of injecting a somber note into an evening at the Bavardages’. They were
embarrassed because they felt the need to express their cynical
superiority to his solemnity, but they didn’t know how to go about it.
Dared they snigger? After all, he was Lord Buffing of the Nobel Short
List and their hosts’ house guest. And they were embarrassed because
there was always the possibility that the old man had said something
profound and they had failed to get it. Sally Rawthrote rolled her eyes
and pulled a mock long face and looked about to see if anyone was
following her lead. Lord Gutt put a downcast smile on his great fat face
and glanced at Bobby Shaflett, who was himself looking at Inez Bavardage
for a clue. She offered none. She stared, dumstruck. Judy was smiling an
entirely foolish smile, it seemed to Sherman, as if she thought
something very pleasant had just been expressed by the distinguished
gentleman from Great Britain.</p>
<p>Inez Bavardage rose up and said, “We’ll have coffee in the other
room.” Gradually, without conviction, the hive began to buzz again.</p>
<p>On the ride back home, the six-block ride, costing 23.25, which is to
say, one half of 46.50, with Mayfair Town Car Inc.’s white-haired driver
at the wheel, Judy chattered away. She was bubbling over. Sherman hadn’t
seen her this animated for more than two weeks, since the night she
caught him in flagrante telephone with Maria. Tonight, obviously, she
had not detected a thing concerning Maria, didn’t even know the pretty
girl sitting next to her husband at dinner had been named Maria. No, she
was in great spirits. She was intoxicated, not by alcohol—alcohol was
fattening—but by Society.</p>
<p>With a pretense of amused detachment she burbled about the shrewdness
with which Inez had chosen her celebrity all-stars: three titles (Baron
Hochswald, Lord Gutt, and Lord Buffing), one ranking politician with a
cosmopolitan cachet (Jacques Prudhomme), four giants of arts and letters
(Bobby Shaflett, Nunnally Voyd, Boris Korolev, and Lord Buffing), two
designers (Ronald Vine and Barbara Cornagglia), three
V.I.F.’s—“V.I.F.’s?” asked Sherman—“Very Important Fags,” said Judy,
“that’s what everybody calls them” (The only name Sherman caught was
that of the Englishman who had sat to her right, St. John Thomas), and
three business titans (Hochswald, Rale Brigham, and Arthur Ruskin). Then
she went on about Ruskin. The woman on his left, Madame Prudhomme,
wouldn’t talk to him, and the woman on his right, Rale Brigham’s wife,
wasn’t interested, and so Ruskin had leaned over and started telling
Baron Hochswald about his air charter service in the Middle East.
“Sherman, have you any idea how that man makes his money? He takes Arabs
to Mecca on airplanes—747s!—by the tens of thousands!—and he’s
Jewish!”</p>
<p>It was the first time she had passed on a piece of chitchat to him,
in the sunny vein of yore, since he couldn’t remember when. But he was
past caring about the life and times of Arthur Ruskin. He could think
only of the gaunt and haunted Englishman, Aubrey Buffing.</p>
<p>And then Judy said, “What on earth do you suppose got into Lord
Buffing? The whole thing was so…so mortifying.”</p>
<p>Mortifying, indeed, thought Sherman. He started to tell her that
Buffing was dying of AIDS, but he was long past the joys of gossip
also.</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” he said.</p>
<p>But of course he did. He knew precisely. That mannered, ghostly
English voice had been the voice of an oracle. Aubrey Buffing had been
speaking straight to him, as if he were a medium dispatched by God
Himself. Edgar Allan Poe!—Poe!—the ruin of the dissolute!—in the
Bronx—the Bronx! The meaningless whirl, the unbridled flesh, the
obliteration of home and hearth!—and, waiting in the last room, the Red
Death.</p>
<p>Eddie had the door open for them by the time they walked from the
Mayfair Town Car sedan to the entrance. Judy sang out, “Hello, Eddie!”
Sherman barely looked at him and said nothing at all. He felt dizzy. In
addition to being consumed by fear, he was drunk. His eyes darted about
the lobby…The Street of Dreams…He half expected to see the shroud.</p>
