<h4 id="shuhmun">18. Shuhmun</h4>
<p>Daniel Torres, the fat assistant district attorney from the Supreme
Court Bureau, arrived at Kramer’s office with his ten-year-old son in
tow and a ditch down the middle of his forehead. He was furious, in a
soft fat way, about having to show up at the island fortress on a
Saturday morning. He looked even more of a blob than he had the last
time Kramer had seen him, which had been in Kovitsky’s courtroom. He
wore a plaid sport shirt, a jacket that didn’t have a prayer of closing
around his great soft belly, and a pair of slacks from the Linebacker
Shop, for the stocky man, in Fresh Meadow that made his underbelly
protrude beneath his belt like South America. A glandular case, thought
Kramer. His son, on the other hand, was slender and dark with fine
features, the shy and sensitive type, by the looks of him. He was
carrying a paperback book and a baseball glove. After a quick, bored
inspection of the office, he sat in Jimmy Caughey’s chair and began
reading the book.</p>
<p>Torres said, “Wouldn’t you know the Yankees’d be on the road”—he
motioned toward Yankee Stadium, just down the hill, with his head—“on
the Saturday”—Saddy—“I gotta come over here? This is my weekend with…”
Now he motioned his head toward his son. “…and I promised him I’d take
him to the ball game, and I promised my ex-wife I’d go to Kiel’s on
Springfield Boulevard and get some shrubs and take them to the house,
and how I’m gonna get from here over to Springfield Boulevard and then
over to Maspeth and then back to Shea in time for the game, I don’t
know. Don’t even ask me why I said I’d take the shrubs over to the
house.” He shook his head.</p>
<p>Kramer felt embarrassed for the boy, who appeared to be deep into the
book. The title was Woman in the Dunes. As best as Kramer could make out
from the cover, the author’s name was Kobo Abé. Feeling curious and
sympathetic, he walked over to the boy and said in the warmest
Dutch-uncle manner possible, “Whaddaya reading?”</p>
<p>The boy looked up like a deer caught in a pair of high beams. “It’s a
story,” he said. Or that was what his lips said. His eyes said, “Please,
please, let me return to the sanctuary of my book.”</p>
<p>Kramer detected that, but he felt obliged to round out his
hospitality.</p>
<p>“What’s it about?”</p>
<p>“Japan.” Pleading.</p>
<p>“Japan? What about Japan?”</p>
<p>“It’s about a man who gets trapped in some sand dunes.” A very soft
voice, pleading, pleading, pleading.</p>
<p>Judging by its abstract cover and dense print, this was not a child’s
book. Kramer, student of the human heart, got an impression of a bright,
withdrawn boy, the product of Torres’s Jewish half, who probably looked
like his mother and was already estranged from his father. For an
instant he thought of his own little son. He tried to imagine having to
drag him over here to Gibraltar some Saturday nine or ten years from
now. It depressed him profoundly.</p>
<p>“Well, whaddaya know about Mr. Auburn, Danny?” he asked Torres.
“What’s this Crack King of Evergreen Avenue business?”</p>
<p>“It’s a piece a—” Torres stopped short for the boy’s sake. “It’s a
joke, is what it is. Auburn’s—you know, just the usual kid from off the
block. This is his third drug arrest. The detective who arrested him
called him the Crack King of Evergreen Avenue. He was being sarcastic.
Evergreen Avenue is about five blocks long. I don’t even know how Weiss
got hold of it. When I saw that press release, I about—I couldn’t
believe it. Thank God, nobody paid any attention to it.” Torres looked
at his watch. “When are they gonna get here?”</p>
<p>“They should be here pretty soon,” said Kramer. “Everything’s slower
over at Rikers Island on Saturday. How did they happen to catch
him?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s a screwy thing,” said Torres. “They really caught him
twice, but this kid has very big—a lotta nerve, or else he’s very
stupid, I don’t know which. About a month ago this undercover cop made a
purchase from Auburn and another kid and announced they were under
arrest, and so forth, and Auburn told him, ‘If you want me,
mother—you’re gonna have to shoot me,’ and he started running. I talked
to the cop, Officer Iannucci. He said if the kid hadn’t been black, in a
black neighborhood, he would’ve shot him or shot at him, anyhow. A week
ago he brought him in, the same cop.”</p>
<p>“What’s he looking at if he’s convicted of a sale?”</p>
<p>“Two to four, maybe.”</p>
<p>“You know anything about his lawyer, this Hayden?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. He’s a black guy.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Kramer started to say, “He didn’t sound black,” but thought
better of it. “You don’t see too many black guys in Legal Aid.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true. There’s quite a few. A lot of them need the job.
You know, these young black lawyers have a rough time. The law schools
graduate them, but there aren’t any slots. Downtown—it’s pathetic.
They’re always talking about it, but they don’t hire black lawyers,
that’s the truth of the matter. So they go into Legal Aid or the 18b
pool. Some a them scuffle along with a rinky-dink criminal practice. But
the big-time black wiseguys, the drug dealers, they don’t want a black
lawyer representing them. The small-timers don’t, either. One time I was
in the pens, and this black lawyer from the 18b comes in looking for the
client he’s been assigned, and he starts yelling out his name. You know
the way they yell out the names in the pens. Anyway, the guy he’s been
assigned is black, and he comes walking over to the bars, and he looks
this guy in the eye and he says, ‘Get lost, mother—I want a Jew.’ I
swear! He says, ‘Get lost, mother—I want a Jew.’ Hayden seems pretty
sharp, but I haven’t seen a lot of him.”</p>
<p>Torres looked at his watch again, and then he looked at the floor in
the corner. In no time his thoughts were somewhere out of the room and
out of Gibraltar. Kiel’s nursery? The Mets? His ex-marriage? His son was
off in Japan with the man trapped in the dunes. Only Kramer was right
there in the room. He was keyed up. He was aware of the stillness of the
island fortress on this sunny Saturday in June. If only this character,
Auburn, turned out to be the real goods, if only he wasn’t too much of
the usual mindless player, trying to get some stupid game over on
everybody, trying to trim the world, bawling into the void from behind
the wire mesh…</p>
<p>Pretty soon Kramer could hear people walking down the hall outside.
He opened the door, and there were Martin and Goldberg and, between
them, a powerfully built young black man in a turtleneck jersey with his
hands behind his back. Bringing up the rear was a short, chunky black
man in a pale gray suit. That would be Cecil Hayden.</p>
<p>Even with his hands behind his back Roland Auburn managed to do the
Pimp Roll. He was no more than five feet seven or eight, but very
muscular. His pectorals, deltoids, and trapezii bulged with mass and
sharp definition. Kramer, the atrophied one, felt a jolt of envy. To say
that the fellow was aware of his terrific build was putting it mildly.
The turtleneck jersey fit him like a skin. He had a gold chain around
his neck. He wore tight black pants and white Reebok sneakers that
looked as if they had just come out of the box. His brown face was
square, hard, and impassive. He had short hair and a narrow mustache
lining his upper lip.</p>
<p>Kramer wondered why Martin had cuffed his hands behind his back. It
was more humiliating than having them cuffed in front. It made a man
feel more helpless and vulnerable. He could feel the danger of falling.
He would fall like a tree, without being able to protect his head. Since
they wanted Roland Auburn’s cooperation, Kramer thought Martin would
have taken the man on the easy route—or did he think there was actually
some danger of this bulked-up rock making a run for it? Or was the
Martin way invariably the hard way?</p>
<p>The entourage came crowding into the little office. The introductions
were an awkward shuffle. Torres, as the assistant district attorney in
charge of the prisoner’s drug case, knew Cecil Hayden, but he didn’t
know Martin, Goldberg, or the prisoner. Hayden didn’t know Kramer, and
Kramer didn’t know the prisoner, and what should they call the prisoner,
anyway? His real status was that of punk arrested on a drug charge, but
at this moment, technically, he was a citizen who had come forth to
assist the authorities in a felony investigation. Martin solved the
nomenclature problem by referring to Roland Auburn frequently and in a
bored manner as “Roland.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Roland, let’s see. Where we gonna put you?”</p>
<p>He looked around the office with its clutter of dilapidated
furniture. Calling a prisoner by his first name was a standard way of
removing any pretensions of dignity and social insulation he might still
be clinging to. Martin was going to put the carcass of Roland Auburn
wherever he felt like. He paused, stared at Kramer, then cast a dubious
glance toward Torres’s son. It was clear that he didn’t think he should
be in the room. The boy was no longer reading his book. He was slouched
back in the chair with his head hung low, staring. He had shrunk. There
was nothing left but an enormous pair of eyes staring at Roland
Auburn.</p>
<p>For everybody else in the room, perhaps even Auburn himself, this was
just a routine procedure, a black defendant being brought into an
assistant district attorney’s office for a negotiation, a little round
of plea bargaining. But this sad, sensitive, bookish little boy would
never forget what he was now looking at, a black man with his hands
shackled behind his back in his daddy’s office building on a sunny
Saturday before the Mets’ game.</p>
<p>Kramer said to Torres, “Dan, I think maybe we’re gonna need that
chair.” He looked toward Torres’s son. “Maybe he’d like to sit in there,
in Bernie Fitzgibbon’s office. There’s nobody in there.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Ollie,” said Torres, “whyn’t you go in there until we get
through.” Kramer wondered if Torres had really named his son Oliver.
Oliver Torres.</p>
<p>Without a word the boy stood up and gathered his book and his
baseball glove and headed for the other door, to Bernie Fitzgibbon’s
office, but he couldn’t resist one last look at the manacled black man.
Roland Auburn stared back at him with no expression at all. He was
closer to the boy’s age than to Kramer’s. For all of his muscles, he
wasn’t much more than a boy himself.</p>
<p>“Okay, Roland,” said Martin, “I’m gonna take these offa you, and
you’re gonna sit’n’at chair there and be a good fellow, right?”</p>
<p>Roland Auburn said nothing, just turned his back slightly to present
Martin his shackled hands so he could unlock the handcuffs.</p>
<p>“Ayyyyyy, don’t worry, Marty,” said Cecil Hayden, “my client’s here
because he wants to walk out of this place, without looking over his
shoulder.”</p>
<p>Kramer couldn’t believe it. Hayden was already calling the Irish
Doberman by his nickname, Marty, and he had just met him. Hayden was one
of those bouncy little fellows whose breeze is so warm and confident
you’d have to be in a very bad mood to take offense. He was pulling off
the difficult trick of showing his client he was sticking up for his
rights and dignity without angering the Irish Cop contingent.</p>
<p>Roland Auburn sat down and started to rub his wrists but then
stopped. He didn’t want to give Martin and Goldberg the satisfaction of
knowing the handcuffs had hurt. Goldberg had walked around behind the
chair and was settling his hulk onto the edge of Ray Andriutti’s desk.
He had a notebook and a ballpoint pen, for taking notes on the
interview. Martin moved around to the other side of Jimmy Caughey’s desk
and sat on the edge over there. The prisoner was now between the two of
them and would have to turn to see either one of them head on. Torres
sat down in Ray Andriutti’s chair, Hayden sat down in Kramer’s, and
Kramer, who was running the show, remained standing. Roland Auburn was
now sitting back in Jimmy Caughey’s chair with his knees akimbo and his
forearms on the armrests, cracking his knuckles, looking straight at
Kramer. His face was a mask. He didn’t even blink. Kramer thought of the
phrase that kept turning up in the probation reports on these young
black male defendants: “lacking in affect.” Apparently that meant they
were deficient in ordinary feelings. They didn’t feel guilt, shame,
remorse, fear, or sympathy for others. But whenever it fell to Kramer’s
lot to talk to these people, he had the feeling it was something else.
They pulled down a curtain. They shut him off from what was behind the
unblinking surface of their eyes. They didn’t let him see so much as an
eighth of an inch of what they thought of him and the Power and their
own lives. He had wondered before and he wondered now: Who are these
people? (These people, whose fates I determine every day…)</p>
<p>Kramer looked at Hayden and said, “Counselor…” Counselor. He didn’t
know quite what to call the man. Hayden had called him “Larry” on the
telephone, from the word go, but he hadn’t called him anything in this
room, and Kramer didn’t want to call him “Cecil,” for fear of appearing
either too chummy or disrespectful in front of Roland. “Counselor,
you’ve explained to your client what we’re doing here, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh, sure,” said Hayden. “He understands.”</p>
<p>Now Kramer looked at Roland. “Mr. Auburn…” Mr. Auburn. Kramer figured
Martin and Goldberg would forgive him. The usual procedure, when an
assistant D.A. was questioning a defendant, was to start off with the
respectful Mister, just to set things up, and then switch to the first
name after things got going. “Mr. Auburn, I think you already know
Mr. Torres here. He’s the assistant district attorney handling the case
you’ve been arrested and indicted on, the sale charge. Okay? And I’m
handling the Henry Lamb case. Now, we can’t promise you anything, but if
you help us, then we’ll help you. It’s as simple as that. But you gotta
be truthful. You gotta be completely truthful. Otherwise, you’re just
jerking everybody around, and it’s not gonna be good for you. You
understand?”</p>
<p>Roland looked at his lawyer, Cecil Hayden, and Hayden just nodded
yes, as if to say, “Don’t worry, it’s okay.”</p>
<p>Roland turned back and looked at Kramer and said, very deadpan:
“Unh-hunh.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Kramer. “What I’m interested in is what happened to
Henry Lamb the night he was hurt. I want you to tell me what you
know.”</p>
<p>Still slouched back in Jimmy Caughey’s chair, Roland said, “Where you
want me to start?”</p>
<p>“Well…at the beginning. How’d you happen to be with Henry Lamb that
night?”</p>
<p>Roland said, “I was standing on the sidewalk, fixing to go down to
161st Street, down to the takeout, the Texas Fried Chicken, and I see
Henry walking by.” He stopped.</p>
<p>Kramer said, “Okay, and then what?”</p>
<p>“I say to him, ‘Henry, where you going?’ And he say, ‘I’m going to
the takeout,’ and I say, ‘That’s where I’m going.’ So we start walking
down to the takeout.”</p>
<p>“Walking down what street?”</p>
<p>“Bruckner Boulevard.”</p>
<p>“Is Henry a good friend of yours?”</p>
<p>For the first time Roland showed an emotion. He seemed faintly
amused. A little smile twisted one corner of his mouth, and he lowered
his eyes, as if an embarrassing topic had come up. “Naw, I just know
him. We live in the same project.”</p>
<p>“You hang around together?”</p>
<p>More amusement. “Naw, Henry don’t hang around much. He don’t come out
a lot.”</p>
<p>“Anyway,” said Kramer, “the two of you are walking down Bruckner
Boulevard on the way to the Texas Fried Chicken. Then what
happened?”</p>
<p>“Well, we go down to Hunts Point Avenue, and we fixing to cross the
street to go over to the Texas Fried Chicken.”</p>
<p>“Cross which street, Hunts Point Avenue or Bruckner Boulevard?”</p>
<p>“Bruckner Boulevard.”</p>
<p>“Just so we get it straight, you’re on which side of Bruckner
Boulevard, the east side going over to the west side?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. The east side going over to the west side. I was
standing out in the street a little ways, waiting for the cars to pass
by, and Henry was standing over here.” He motioned to his right. “So I
can see the cars better than he can, because they be coming up from this
way.” He motioned to his left. “The cars, mostly they be traveling out
in the center lane, in, you know, like a line, and all of a sudden this
one car, it pulls out, and it wants to pass all these other cars on the
right, and I can see it’s coming too close to where I’m standing. So I
jump back. But Henry, I guess he don’t see anything until he see me jump
back, and then I hear this little tap, and I see Henry falling, like
this.” He made a spinning motion with his forefinger.</p>
<p>“Okay, what happened then?”</p>
<p>“Then I hear this screech. This car, it’s putting on the brakes. The
first thing I do, I go over to Henry, and he’s lying there on the
street, by the sidewalk, and he’s curled up on one side, kind of hugging
one arm, and I say, ‘Henry, you hurt?’ And he say, ‘I think I broke my
arm.’”</p>
<p>“Did he say he hurt his head?”</p>
<p>“He told me that later. When I was squatting over him there, he kept
on saying his arm hurt. And then I was taking him to the hospital, and
he told me when he was falling, he put his arms out and he came down on
his arm and then he kept on rolling and hit his head.”</p>
<p>“All right, let’s get back to right after it happened. You’re there
beside Henry Lamb in the street, and this car that hit him, it put on
its brakes. Did it stop?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I can see it’s stopped up the road.”</p>
<p>“How far up the road?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Maybe a hundred feet. The door opens, and this guy
gets out, a white guy. And this guy, he’s looking back. He’s looking
right back at me and Henry.”</p>
<p>“What did you do?”</p>
<p>“Well, I figured this guy, he stopped because he hit Henry and was
gonna see if he could help. I figured, hey, the guy can take Henry to
the hospital. So I got up, and started walking toward him, and I said,
‘Yo! Yo! We need some help!’”</p>
<p>“And what did he do?”</p>
<p>“The man looked right at me, and then the door on the other side of
the car opens, and there’s this woman. She gets kind of, you know,
halfway out the car, and she’s looking back, too. They both looking back
at me, and I say, ‘Yo! My friend’s hurt!’”</p>
<p>“How far from them were you by this time?”</p>
<p>“Not very far. Fifteen or twenty feet.”</p>
<p>“Could you see them clearly?”</p>
<p>“I was looking them right in the face.”</p>
<p>“What did they do?”</p>
<p>“This woman, she had this look on her face. She look frightened. She
say, ‘Shuhmun, look out!’ She’s talking to the guy.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Shuhmun, watch out’? She said, ‘Shuhmun’?” Kramer cut a glance at
Martin. Martin opened his eyes wide and forced a pocket of air up under
his upper lip. Goldberg had his head down, taking notes.</p>
<p>“That’s what it sound like to me.”</p>
<p>“Shuhmun or Sherman?”</p>
<p>“Sound like Shuhmun.”</p>
<p>“Okay, what happened then?”</p>
<p>“The woman, she jump back inside the car. The man, he’s back behind
the car looking at me. Then the woman, she say, ‘Shuhmun, get in!’ Only
now she’s sitting in the driver’s seat. And the man, he runs around to
the other side, where she been sitting, and he jumps in the car and
slams the door.”</p>
<p>“So now they’ve switched seats. And what did you do? How far away
from them were you by this time?”</p>
<p>“Almost as close as I am to you.”</p>
<p>“Were you angry? Did you yell at them?”</p>
<p>“All’s I said was, ‘My friend’s hurt.’”</p>
<p>“Did you make a fist? Did you make any threatening gesture?”</p>
<p>“All’s I wanted was to get Henry some help. I wasn’t angry. I was
scared, for Henry.”</p>
<p>“Okay, then what happened?”</p>
<p>“I ran around to the front of the car.”</p>
<p>“Which side?”</p>
<p>“Which side? The right side, where the guy was. I was looking right
through the windshield at them. I’m saying, ‘Yo! My friend’s hurt!’ I’m
in the front of the car, looking back down the street, and there’s
Henry. He’s right behind the car. He be walking up, kind of in a daze,
you know, holding his arm like this.” Roland held his left forearm with
his right hand and let his left hand dangle, as if it were afflicted.
“So that means, this guy, he could see Henry coming the whole time,
holding his arm like this. Ain’t no way he don’t know Henry was hurt.
I’m looking at Henry, and the next thing I know, the woman, she guns the
motor and she cuts outta there, laying down rubber. She cuts outta there
so fast I can see the man’s head snap back. He’s looking right at me,
and his head snaps back, and they outta there like a rocket. Come that
close to me.” He brought his thumb and forefinger together. “Like to
tore me up worse than Henry.”</p>
<p>“You get the license number?”</p>
<p>“Naw. But Henry got it. Or I guess he got part of it.”</p>
<p>“Did he tell you what it was?”</p>
<p>“Naw. I guess he told his mother. I saw that on television.”</p>
<p>“What kind of car was it?”</p>
<p>“It was a Mercedes.”</p>
<p>“What color?”</p>
<p>“Black.”</p>
<p>“What model?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what model.”</p>
<p>“How many doors?”</p>
<p>“Two. It was, like, you know, built low. It was a sporty car.”</p>
<p>Kramer looked at Martin again. Once more he had on his big-eyed bingo
face.</p>
<p>“Would you recognize the man if you saw him again?”</p>
<p>“I’d recognize him.” Roland said this with a bitter conviction that
had the ring of truth.</p>
<p>“What about the woman?”</p>
<p>“Her, too. Wasn’t nothing but a piece a glass between me and
them.”</p>
<p>“What did the woman look like? How old was she?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. She was white. I don’t know how old she was.”</p>
<p>“Well, was she old or young? Was she closer to twenty-five,
thirty-five, forty-five, or fifty-five?”</p>
<p>“Twenty-five, most likely.”</p>
<p>“Light hair, dark hair, red hair?”</p>
<p>“Dark hair.”</p>
<p>“What was she wearing?”</p>
<p>“I think a dress. She was all in blue. I remember because it was a
real bright blue, and she had these big shoulders on the dress. I
remember that.”</p>
<p>“What did the man look like?”</p>
<p>“He was tall. He had on a suit and a necktie.”</p>
<p>“What color suit?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It was a dark suit. That’s all I remember.”</p>
<p>“How old was he? Would you say he was my age, or was he older? Or
younger?”</p>
<p>“A little older.”</p>
<p>“And you’d recognize him if you saw him again.”</p>
<p>“I’d recognize him.”</p>
<p>“Well, Roland, I’m gonna show you some pictures, and I want you to
tell me if you recognize anybody in the pictures. Okay?”</p>
<p>“Unh-hunh.”</p>
<p>Kramer walked over to his own desk, where Hayden was sitting, and
said, “Excuse me a second,” and opened a drawer. As he did so, he looked
at Hayden for a moment and nodded slightly, as if to say, “It’s working
out.” From the drawer he took the set of pictures Milt Lubell had put
together for Weiss. He spread the pictures out on Jimmy Caughey’s desk,
in front of Roland Auburn.</p>
<p>“You recognize any of these people?”</p>
<p>Roland scanned the pictures, and his forefinger went straight to
Sherman McCoy grinning in his tuxedo.</p>
<p>“That’s him.”</p>
<p>“How do you know it’s the same guy?”</p>
<p>“That’s him. I recognize him. That’s his chin. The man had this big
chin.”</p>
<p>Kramer looked at Martin and then at Goldberg. Goldberg was smiling
ever so slightly.</p>
<p>“You see the woman in the picture, the woman he’s standing beside? Is
that the woman who was in the car?”</p>
<p>“Naw. The woman in the car was younger, and she had darker hair, and
she was more…more foxy.”</p>
<p>“Foxy?”</p>
<p>Roland started to smile again but fought it off. “You know, more of
a…hot ticket.”</p>
<p>Kramer allowed himself a smile and a chuckle. It gave him a chance to
let out some of the elation he was already feeling. “A hot ticket, hunh?
Okay, a hot ticket. All right. So they leave the scene. What did you do
then?”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t much I could do. Henry was standing there holding his arm.
His wrist was all bent outta shape. So I said, ‘Henry, you got to go to
the hospital,’ and he say he don’t want to go to no hospital, he want to
go home. So we start walking back up Bruckner Boulevard, back to the
project.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” said Kramer. “Did anybody see all this happen? Was
there anybody on the sidewalk?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“No cars stopped?”</p>
<p>“Naw. I guess Henry, if he be laying there very long, maybe somebody
stop. But nobody stopped.”</p>
<p>“So now you’re walking up Bruckner Boulevard, back toward the
project.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. And Henry, he be moaning and looking like he’s fixing
to pass out, and I say, ‘Henry, you got to go to the hospital.’ So I
walk him on back down to Hunts Point Avenue, and we go on across to
161st Street, to the subway stop ov’eh, and I see this taxi, belongs to
my man Brill.”</p>
<p>“Brill?”</p>
<p>“He’s a fellow that has two cabs.”</p>
<p>“And he drove you to Lincoln Hospital?”</p>
<p>“This fellow Curly Kale, he drove. He’s one a Brill’s drivers.”</p>
<p>“Curly Kale. Is that his real name or is that a nickname?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. That’s what they call him, Curly Kale.”</p>
<p>“And he drove the two of you to the hospital.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“What did Henry’s condition seem to be on the way to the hospital?
That’s when he told you he’d hit his head?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, but mostly he was talking about his arm. His wrist
looked bad.”</p>
<p>“Was he coherent? Was he in his right mind, the best you could
tell?”</p>
<p>“Like I say, he was moaning a lot and saying how his arm hurt. But he
knew where he was. He knew what was happening.”</p>
<p>“When you reached the hospital, what did you do?”</p>
<p>“Well, we got out, and I walked with Henry to the door, to the
emergency room, and he went in there.”</p>
<p>“Did you go in with him?”</p>
<p>“No, I got back in the cab with Curly Kale and I left.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t stay with Henry?”</p>
<p>“I figured I couldn’t do no more for him.” Roland cut a glance toward
Hayden.</p>
<p>“How did Henry get home from the hospital?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Kramer paused. “All right, Roland, there’s one more thing I want to
know. Why haven’t you come forth with this information before now? I
mean, here you are with your friend, or your neighbor anyhow—he’s from
the same project—and he’s a victim of a hit-and-run accident right in
front of your eyes, and the case is on television and all over the
newspapers, and we don’t hear a peep outta you until now. Whaddaya say
to that?”</p>
<p>Roland looked at Hayden, who merely nodded yes, and Roland said, “The
cops was looking for me.”</p>
<p>Hayden spoke up. “There was a warrant out for criminal sale, criminal
possession, resisting arrest, and a couple of other things, the same
charges he was just indicted on.”</p>
<p>Kramer said to Roland, “So you were protecting yourself. You withheld
this information rather than have to talk to the cops.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Kramer was giddy with joy. He could already see it taking shape. This
Roland was no sweetheart, but he was entirely credible. Get him out of
the bodybuilder jersey and the sneakers! Break his hip so he can’t do
the Pimp Roll! Bury this business of the Crack King of Evergreen Avenue!
Didn’t look good to juries if a major criminal came into court offering
testimony in exchange for a misdemeanor plea. But just a cleanup and a
trim—that’s all this case needs! All at once Kramer could see it…the
drawing…</p>
<p>He said to Roland, “And you’re telling me the complete truth.”</p>
<p>“Unh-hunh.”</p>
<p>“You’re not adding anything or leaving anything out.”</p>
<p>“Unh-unh.”</p>
<p>Kramer went over to Jimmy Caughey’s desk, right beside Roland, and
gathered up the pictures. Then he turned to Cecil Hayden.</p>
<p>“Counselor,” he said, “I’ve gotta talk this over with my superiors.
But unless I’m mistaken, I think we got a deal.”</p>
<p>He saw it before the words were even out of his mouth…the drawing…by
the courtroom artist…He could see it as if the TV screen were already
right in front of him…Assistant District Attorney Lawrence N. Kramer…on
his feet…his forefinger raised…his massive sternocleidomastoid muscles
welling out…But how would the artist deal with his skull, where he had
lost so much hair? Well, if the drawing did justice to his powerful
frame, no one would notice. The courage and the eloquence…that’s what
they would see. The whole city of New York would see it. Miss Shelly
Thomas would see it.</p>
