<h4 id="calls-from-above">20. Calls from Above</h4>
<p>Gene Lopwitz didn’t receive visitors at his desk. He sat them down in
a cluster of huge English Chippendale wing chairs and Irish Chippendale
side tables in front of the fireplace. The Chippendale cluster, like the
other clusters of furniture in the vast space, was the brainchild of
Ronald Vine, the decorator. But the fireplace was Lopwitz’s. The
fireplace worked. The bond trading room stewards, who were like aged
bank guards, could actually build a log fire in it—a fact that had
provided several weeks of sniggers for in-house cynics such as Rawlie
Thorpe.</p>
<p>Being a modern office tower, the building had no chimney flues. But
Lopwitz, after a year of stupendous success, was determined to have a
working fireplace with a carved wood mantelpiece in his office. And why?
Because Lord Upland, owner of the London Daily Courier, had one. The
austere peer had given a lunch for Lopwitz in his suite of offices in a
grand old brick building on Fleet Street in hopes of having him flog a
lot of “creatively structured” Daily Courier stock to the Yanks. Lopwitz
had never forgotten how a butler had come in from time to time to put a
log on the warm and toasty pungent fire in the fireplace. It was so…how
should one say it?…so baronial, it was. Lopwitz had felt like a
fortunate little boy who had been invited to the home of a great
man.</p>
<p>Home. That was the ticket. The British, with that ever sure class
instinct of theirs, realized that if a man was at the top in business,
he should not have the standard business office, which made one look
like an interchangeable part in a large mechanism. No, one should have
an office that looked like the home of a nobleman, as much as to
declare: “I, personally, am the lord, creator, and master of this great
organization.” Lopwitz had ended up in a terrific fight with the tower’s
owners and the management company that ran it for them and the city’s
Building Department and Fire Department, and the construction of the
flues and vents had cost 50,000, but he had finally had his way, and
Sherman McCoy now stared reflectively into the mouth of that baronial
hearth, fifty floors above Wall Street, off the bond trading floor of
Pierce andandandand Pierce. There was no fire in the fireplace, however.
There had been none for a long time.</p>
<p>Sherman could feel an electrical trill of tachycardia in his chest.
Both of them, Lopwitz and himself, were sitting in the wingback
Chippendale monsters. Lopwitz wasn’t very good at small talk on even the
happiest occasions, and this little meeting was going to be grim. The
fireplace…the chiggers…Christ…Well, anything was better than looking
like a beaten dog. So Sherman straightened himself up in the chair,
lifted his great chin, and even managed to look slightly down his nose
at the lord and master of this mighty organization.</p>
<p>“Sherman,” said Gene Lopwitz, “I’m not gonna beat around the bush
with you. I got too much respect for you to do that.”</p>
<p>The electrical trill in his chest! Sherman’s mind raced along with
his heart, and he found himself wondering, quite idly, whether or not
Lopwitz knew where the phrase “beat around the bush” came from. Probably
not.</p>
<p>“I had a long talk with Arnold on Friday,” Lopwitz was saying. “Now,
what I’m gonna say to you—I want to make one thing clear, it’s not the
money, or it’s not any money that was lost—that’s not the issue here.”
This expedition out onto the psychological terrain threw Lopwitz’s
already sunken cheeks into perplexed creases. He was a jogging zealot (5
A.M. breed). He had the gaunt and haunted athletic look of those who
stare daily down the bony gullet of the great god Aerobics.</p>
<p>Now he was into the business of Oscar Suder and the United Fragrance
bonds, and Sherman knew he should pay close attention. United Fragrance
bonds…Oscar Suder…and he thought of The City Light. What did it mean,
“close to a major break in the Henry Lamb Case”? The story, by this same
Fallow, was bafflingly vague, except to say that the “break” had been
triggered by The City Light story about the possible license plate
numbers. Triggered! That was the word they used! Somehow that word had
set off the tachycardia as he sat hidden in the toilet booth. None of
the other newspapers carried any such story.</p>
<p>Now Lopwitz was going on about the business of his being AWOL the day
the big bond issue came in. Sherman could see Freddy Button’s foppish
hands fluttering about the cigarette case. Gene Lopwitz’s lips were
moving. The telephone on the Irish Chippendale table beside Lopwitz’s
wing chair rang with a discreet murmuring burble. Lopwitz picked it up
and said, “Yeah?…Okay, good. Is he on the line yet?”</p>
<p>Unaccountably, Lopwitz now beamed at Sherman and said, “Only take a
second. I gave Bobby Shaflett a lift on the plane so he could keep a
date in Vancouver. They’re up over Wisconsin or South Dakota or some
goddamned place.”</p>
<p>Lopwitz now lowered his eyes and sank back in the wing chair and
beamed in anticipation of talking to the famous Golden Hillbilly whose
famous buttery bulk and tenor voice were now encased in Lopwitz’s own
eight-seat jet aircraft with Rolls-Royce engines. Strictly speaking, it
was Pierce andandandand Pierce’s, but to all practical purposes, it was
his, personally, baronially. Lopwitz lowered his head, and great
animation came over his face, and he said: “Bobby? Bobby? Can you hear
me?…What’s that? How’s it going?…They treating you all right up
there?…What?…Hello? Hello?…Bobby? You still there? Hello? Can you hear
me? Bobby?”</p>
<p>Still holding the telephone, Lopwitz looked at Sherman with a scowl,
as if he had just done something far worse than get suckered on the
United Fragrance deal or go absent without leave. “Shit,” he said. “Lost
the connection.” He clicked the receiver. “Miss Bayles?…Lost the
connection. See if you can get the plane again.”</p>
<p>He hung up and looked miserable. He had lost the opportunity to have
the great artist, the great ball of fat and fame, pay him his thanks
and, thereby, homage to the Lopwitz eminence from the skies forty
thousand feet over the American heartland.</p>
<p>“Okay, where were we?” asked Lopwitz, looking as angry as Sherman had
ever seen him. “Oh yeah, the Giscard.” Lopwitz began shaking his head,
as if something truly dreadful had happened, and Sherman braced, because
the debacle of the gold-backed bonds was the worst of it. In the next
instant, however, Sherman had the eerie feeling that Lopwitz was really
shaking his head over the broken telephone connection.</p>
<p>The telephone rang again. Lopwitz pounced on it. “Yeah?…You got the
plane?…What?…Well, all right, put him through.”</p>
<p>This time Lopwitz looked at Sherman and shook his head with
frustration and bewilderment, as if Sherman was his understanding
friend. “It’s Ronald Vine. He’s calling from England. He’s out in
Wiltshire. He’s found some linenfold paneling for me. They’re six hours
ahead of us there, so I gotta take it.”</p>
<p>His voice asked for understanding and forgiveness. Linenfold
paneling? Sherman could only stare. But apparently fearful that he might
say something at such a critical juncture, Lopwitz held up one finger
and closed his eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>“Ronald? Where you calling from?…That’s what I thought…No, I know it
very well…Whaddaya mean, they won’t sell it to you?”</p>
<p>Lopwitz fell into a deep discussion with the decorator, Ronald Vine,
about some impediment to the purchase of the linenfold paneling in
Wiltshire. Sherman looked at the fireplace again…The chiggers…Lopwitz
had used the fireplace for just about two months and then never again.
One day, while sitting at his desk, he had suffered an intense itching
and burning sensation on the underside of his left buttock. Fiery red
blisters he had…Chigger bites…The only plausible deduction was that
somehow chiggers had found their way to the fiftieth floor, to the
mighty bond trading floor of Pierce andandandand Pierce, in a load of
firewood for the hearth and had bitten the baron on the bottom. On the
brass andirons at this moment was a stack of carefully chosen New
Hampshire hardwood logs, sculpturally perfect, perfectly clean, utterly
antiseptic, buggered with enough insecticide to empty a banana grove of
everything that moves, permanently installed, never to be lit.</p>
<p>Lopwitz’s voice rose. “Whaddaya mean they won’t sell it to
‘trade’?…Yeah, I know they said it to you, but they know you’re getting
it for me. What are they talking about, ‘trade’?…Unnh-hnnh…Yeah, well,
you tell ’em I got a word for them. Trayf…Let ’em figure it out for
themselves. If I’m ‘trade,’ they’re trayf…What’s it mean? It means,
like, ‘not kosher,’ only it’s worse than that. In plain English I guess
the word is shit. There’s an old saying, ‘If you look close enough,
everything is trayf,’ and that goes for these moth-eaten aristocrats,
too, Ronald. Tell ’em to take their linenfold panels and shove ’em.”</p>
<p>Lopwitz hung up and looked at Sherman with great irritation.</p>
<p>“All right, Sherman, let’s get down to cases.” He sounded as if
Sherman had been stalling, arguing, evading, double-talking him, and
otherwise trying to drive him crazy. “I can’t figure out what happened
with the Giscard…Lemme ask you something.” He cocked his head and put on
the look that says, “I’m a shrewd observer of human nature.”</p>
<p>“I’m not prying,” he said, “but I want you to tell me anyway. You
having trouble at home or something?”</p>
<p>For a moment Sherman entertained the notion of appealing, man-to-man,
for pity and revealing just an inch or two of his infidelity. But a
sixth sense told him that “problems at home” would only arouse Lopwitz’s
contempt and his appetite for gossip, which seemed to be considerable.
So he shook his head and smiled slightly, to indicate that the question
didn’t even trouble him, and said, “No, not at all.”</p>
<p>“Well, do you need a vacation or something?”</p>
<p>Sherman didn’t know what to say to that. But his spirits rose. At
least it didn’t sound as if Lopwitz was about to fire him. In fact, he
didn’t have to say anything, because the telephone rang again. Lopwitz
picked up the receiver, although not so rapidly this time.</p>
<p>“Yeah?…What’s that, Miss Bayles?…Sherman?” A big sigh. “Well, he’s
right here.”</p>
<p>Lopwitz looked at Sherman quizzically. “Seems to be for you.” He held
out the receiver.</p>
<p>Very odd. Sherman got up, took the receiver, and stood beside
Lopwitz’s chair. “Hello?”</p>
<p>“Mr. McCoy?” It was Miss Bayles, Lopwitz’s secretary. “There’s a
Mr. Killian on the line. He says it’s ‘imperative’ that he speak to you.
Do you want to speak to him?”</p>
<p>Sherman felt a thud of palpitation in his chest. Then his heart
kicked off into a steady, galloping tachycardia. “Yes. Thank you.”</p>
<p>A voice said, “Sherman?” It was Killian. He had never called him by
his first name before. “I had to get hold of you.” Hadda gedoldya.</p>
<p>“I’m in Mr. Lopwitz’s office,” said Sherman, in a formal voice.</p>
<p>“I know that,” said Killian. “But I had to make sure you didn’t leave
the building or something before I godoldya. I just got a call from
Bernie Fitzgibbon. They claim they got a witness who can—make the people
who were at the scene. You follow me?”</p>
<p>“Make?”</p>
<p>“Identify ’em.”</p>
<p>“I see…Let me call you when I get back to my desk.” Composed.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’m in my office, but I got to head to court. So make it
quick. There’s one very important thing you got to know. They’re gonna
want to see you, officially, tomorrow. Officially, okay? So you call me
back immediately.” The way Killian said “officially,” Sherman could tell
it was a code expression, in case someone in Lopwitz’s office had access
to the conversation.</p>
<p>“All right,” he said. Composed. “Thank you.” He put the receiver back
on the cradle on the Irish Chippendale table and sat back down in the
wing chair in a daze.</p>
<p>Lopwitz continued as if the call had never taken place. “As I told
you, Sherman, the question is not that you lost money for Pierce
andandandand Pierce. That’s not what I’m saying. The Giscard was your
idea. It was a great strategy, and you thought of it. But I mean, f’r
Chrissake, you worked on it for four months, and you’re our number one
bond salesman out there. So it isn’t the money you lost for us, it’s
that here you are, you’re a guy who’s supposed to function the best out
there, and now we got a situation where we got a whole string of these
things that I’ve been talking to you about—”</p>
<p>Lopwitz stopped talking and stared with astonishment as Sherman,
without a word, stood up in front of him. Sherman knew what he was
doing, but at the same time he seemed to have no control over it. He
couldn’t just stand up and walk out on Gene Lopwitz in the middle of a
crucial talk about his performance at Pierce andandandand Pierce, and
yet he couldn’t sit there another second.</p>
<p>“Gene,” he said, “you’ll have to excuse me. I have to leave.” He
could hear his own voice as if he were hearing it from outside. “I’m
really sorry, but I have to.”</p>
<p>Lopwitz remained seated and looked at him as if he’d gone crazy.</p>
<p>“That call,” said Sherman. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>He started walking out of the office. In his peripheral vision he was
aware of Lopwitz following him with his eyes.</p>
<p>Out on the floor of the bond trading room, the morning madness had
reached its peak. As he headed toward his desk, Sherman felt as if he
were swimming through a delirium.</p>
<p>“…October ninety-twos at the buck…”</p>
<p>“…I said we strip the fuckers!”</p>
<p>Ahhhhh, the golden crumbs…How pointless it seemed…</p>
<p>As he sat down at his desk, Arguello approached and said, “Sherman,
do you know anything about 10 million Joshua Tree SandandandandLs?”</p>
<p>Sherman waved him back, the way you would warn someone away from a
fire or the edge of a cliff. He noticed his forefinger shaking as he
pressed out Killian’s number on the telephone. The receptionist
answered, and in his mind Sherman could see the scalding brightness of
the reception area in the old building on Reade Street. In a moment
Killian was on the line.</p>
<p>“You someplace you can talk?” he asked. Tawk.</p>
<p>“Yes. What did you mean, they want to see me officially?”</p>
<p>“They wanna bring you in. It’s unethical, it’s unnecessary, it’s
bullshit, but that’s what they’re gonna do.”</p>
<p>“Bring me in?” Even as he said it, he had the dreadful feeling he
knew what Killian meant. The question was an involuntary prayer, from
his very central nervous system, that he be wrong.</p>
<p>“They’re gonna place you under arrest. It’s outrageous. They should
take whatever they got before a grand jury and get an indictment and
then see about an arraignment. Bernie knows that, but Weiss’s gotta have
a quick arrest to get the press off his back.”</p>
<p>Sherman’s throat went dry with “place you under arrest.” The rest was
just words.</p>
<p>“Under arrest?” A croak.</p>
<p>“Weiss is an animal,” said Killian, “and he’s a whore for the
press.”</p>
<p>“Under arrest—you can’t be serious.” Please don’t let it be true.
“What can they—what are they charging me with?”</p>
<p>“Reckless endangerment, leaving the scene of an accident, and failure
to report.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it.” Please make this unreal. “Reckless
endangerment? But from what you said—I mean, how can they? I wasn’t even
driving!”</p>
<p>“Not according to their witness. Bernie said the witness picked your
picture out from a set of photographs.”</p>
<p>“But I wasn’t driving!”</p>
<p>“I’m only telling you what Bernie told me. He says the witness also
knew the color of your car and the model.”</p>
<p>Sherman was aware of his own rapid breathing and the roar of the bond
trading room.</p>
<p>Killian said, “You there?”</p>
<p>Sherman, hoarsely: “Yes…Who is this witness?”</p>
<p>“That he wouldn’t tell me.”</p>
<p>“Is it the other boy?”</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t say.”</p>
<p>“Or—Christ!—Maria?”</p>
<p>“He’s not gonna tell me that.”</p>
<p>“Did he say anything about a woman in the car?”</p>
<p>“No. They’re gonna keep the details to themselves at this point. But
look. Lemme tell you something. This is not gonna be as bad as you
think. I got a commitment from Bernie. I can bring you up there and
surrender you myself. You’ll be in there and outta there. Ba-bing.”</p>
<p>In and out of what? But what he said was “Surrender me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. If they wanted, they could come downtown and arrest you and
take you up there in handcuffs.”</p>
<p>“Up where?”</p>
<p>“The Bronx. But that’s not gonna happen. I got a commitment from
Bernie. And by the time they release it to the press, you’ll be outta
there. You can be thankful for that.”</p>
<p>The press…the Bronx…surrender…reckless endangerment…one grotesque
abstraction after another. All at once he was desperate to visualize
what was about to happen, to picture it, no matter what it was, rather
than simply feel the horrible force closing in about him.</p>
<p>Killian said, “You there?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You can thank Bernie Fitzgibbon. You remember what I was telling you
about contracts? This is a contract, between me and Bernie.”</p>
<p>“Look,” said Sherman, “I’ve got to come by and talk to you.”</p>
<p>“Right now I got to go over to court I’m already”—awready—“late. But
I should be through by one. Come on over around one. You probably gonna
need a couple of hours anyway.”</p>
<p>This time Sherman knew exactly what Killian was talking about. “Oh,
God,” he said in his now husky voice, “I’ve got to talk to my wife. She
doesn’t know the first thing about any of this.” He was talking as much
to himself as to Killian. “And my daughter and my parents…and Lopwitz…I
don’t know…I can’t tell you—this is absolutely incredible.”</p>
<p>“It’s like the ground’s been cut out from under you, right? That’s
the most natural thing inna world. You’re not a criminal. But it’s not
gonna be as bad as you think. This don’t mean they got a case. It just
means they think they got enough to make a move. So I’m gonna tell you
something. Or I’m gonna tell you something I already told you, again.
You’re gonna have to tell some people what’s happening, but don’t get
into the details of what happened that night. Your wife—well, what you
tell her, that’s between you and her, and I can’t guide you on that. But
anybody else—don’t get into it. It can be used against you.”</p>
<p>A sad, sad wave of sentiment rolled over Sherman. What could he say
to Campbell? And how much would she pick up from what other people said
about him? Six years old; so guileless; a little girl who loves flowers
and rabbits.</p>
<p>“I understand,” he said in an utterly depressed voice. How could
Campbell be anything but crushed by it all?</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to Killian, he sat at his desk and let the
diode-green letters and numbers on the computer screens skid in front of
his eyes. Logically, intellectually, he knew that Campbell, his little
girl, would be the first person to believe him totally and the last to
lose faith in him, and yet there was no use trying to think logically
and intellectually about it. He could see her tender and exquisite
little face.</p>
<p>His concern for Campbell had one fortunate effect, at least. It
overshadowed the first of his difficult tasks, which was going back in
to see Eugene Lopwitz.</p>
<p>When he showed up at Lopwitz’s suite again, Miss Bayles gave him a
wary look. Obviously Lopwitz had told her that he had gone walking out
of the room like a lunatic. She directed him to a bombastic French
armchair and kept an eye on him for the fifteen minutes he was kept
waiting before Lopwitz summoned him back in.</p>
<p>Lopwitz was standing when Sherman entered the office and didn’t offer
him a seat. Instead, he intercepted him out in the middle of the room’s
vast Oriental rug, as if to say, “Okay, I let you back in. Now make it
quick.”</p>
<p>Sherman raised his chin and tried to look dignified. But he felt
giddy at the thought of what he was about to reveal, about to
confess.</p>
<p>“Gene,” he said, “I didn’t mean to walk out of here so abruptly, but
I had no choice. That call that came in while we were talking. You asked
me if I had any problems. Well, the fact of the matter is, I do. I’m
going to be arrested in the morning.”</p>
<p>At first Lopwitz just stared at him. Sherman noticed how thick and
wrinkled his eyelids were. Then he said, “Let’s go over here,” and
motioned toward the cluster of wingback chairs.</p>
<p>They sat down once more. Sherman felt a twinge of resentment at the
look of absorption in Lopwitz’s bat face, which had voyeur written all
over it. Sherman told him of the Lamb case as it had first appeared in
the press and then of the visit of the two detectives to his house,
although without the humiliating details. All the while he stared at
Lopwitz’s rapt face and felt the sickening thrill of the hopeless wanton
who flings good money after bad and a good life after vile weak sins.
The temptation to tell all, to be truly wanton, to tell of the sweet
loamy loins of Maria Ruskin and the fight in the jungle and his victory
over the two brutes—to tell Lopwitz that whatever he had done, he had
done it as a man—and that as a man he had been blameless—and, more than
blameless, perhaps even a hero—the temptation to lay bare the entire
drama—in which I was not a villain!—was very nearly more than he could
withstand. But he held back.</p>
<p>“That was my lawyer who called while I was in here, Gene, and he says
I shouldn’t go into the details of what happened or didn’t happen with
anybody right now, but I do want you to know one thing, particularly
since I don’t know what’s going to be said in the press about all this.
And that is that I did not hit anybody with my car or drive it
recklessly or do anything else that I can’t have a completely clear
conscience about.”</p>
<p>As soon as he said “conscience,” he realized that every guilty man
talks about his clear conscience.</p>
<p>“Who’s your lawyer?” asked Lopwitz.</p>
<p>“His name is Thomas Killian.”</p>
<p>“Don’t know him. You oughta get Roy Branner. He’s the greatest
litigator in New York. Fabulous. If I was ever in a jam, I’d get Roy. If
you want him, I’ll call him.”</p>
<p>Nonplussed, Sherman listened as Lopwitz went on about the power of
the fabulous Roy Branner and the cases he had won and how he first met
him and how close they were and how their wives knew each other and how
much Roy would do for him if he, Gene Lopwitz, said the word.</p>
<p>So that was Lopwitz’s overpowering instinct upon hearing of this
crisis in Sherman’s life: to tell him of his inside knowledge and the
important people he knew and what a hold he, the magnetic baron, had
over the Big Name. The second instinct was more practical. It was set
off by the word press. Lopwitz proposed, in a way that did not invite
debate, that Sherman take a leave of absence until this unfortunate
matter was resolved.</p>
<p>This perfectly reasonable suggestion, calmly made, set off a neural
alarm. If he took a leave of absence, he might—he wasn’t completely
sure—he might still draw his base salary of 0,000 a month, which was
less than half of what he had to pay each month in loan payments. But he
would no longer share in commissions and bond trading division profits.
For all practical purposes, he would have no more income.</p>
<p>The telephone on Lopwitz’s Irish Chippendale side table rang with its
little cooing ring. Lopwitz picked it up.</p>
<p>“Yeah?…You do?” Big smile. “Terrific…Hello?…Hello?…Bobby? You hear me
all right?” He looked at Sherman and gave him a relaxed smile and
mouthed the man’s name, Bobby Shaflett. Then he looked down and
concentrated on the receiver. His face was creased and crinkled with
purest joy. “You say it’s okay?…Wonderful! I’m glad to do it. They’ve
given you something to eat, I assume…Good, good. Now listen. You need
anything, you just ask them. They’re nice fellows. Dja know they both
flew in Vietnam?…Oh sure. They’re terrific fellows. You want a drink or
anything, you just ask ’em. I keep some 1934 Armagnac on the plane. I
think it’s stowed in the back. Ask the smaller one, Tony. He knows where
it is…Well, when you come back tonight, then. It’s great stuff. That’s
the greatest year there ever was for Armagnac, 1934. It’s very smooth.
It’ll help you relax…So it’s okay, hunh?…Great. Well…What?…Not at all,
Bobby. Glad to do it, glad to do it.”</p>
<p>When he hung up, he couldn’t have looked happier. The most famous
opera singer in America was in his airplane, hitching a ride to
Vancouver, Canada, with Lopwitz’s own two former Air Force captains,
veterans of combat in Vietnam, as chauffeurs and butlers, serving him
Armagnac more than half a century old, ,200 a bottle, and now this
wonderful round famous fellow was thanking him, paying his respects,
from forty thousand feet above the state of Montana.</p>
<p>Sherman stared at Lopwitz’s smiling face and grew frightened. Lopwitz
wasn’t angry at him. He wasn’t perturbed. He wasn’t even particularly
put out. No, the fate of Sherman McCoy didn’t make all that much
difference. Lopwitz’s English Reproduction life would endure Sherman
McCoy’s problems, and Pierce andandandand Pierce would endure them.
Everybody would enjoy the juicy story for a while, and bonds would go on
being sold in vast quantities, and the new chief bond
salesman—who?—Rawlie?—or somebody else?—would show up in Lopwitz’s
Tea-at-the-Connaught conference room to discuss raking Pierce
andandandand Pierce’s billions to this part of the market or that.
Another air-to-ground telephone call from some fat celebrity and Lopwitz
wouldn’t even remember who he was.</p>
<p>“Bobby Shaflett,” said Lopwitz, as if he and Sherman were sitting
around having a drink before dinner. “He was over Montana when he
called.” He shook his head and chuckled, as if to say, “A hell of a
guy.”</p>
