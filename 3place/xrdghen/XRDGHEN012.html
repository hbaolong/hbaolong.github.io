<h4 id="the-words-on-the-floor">11. The Words on the Floor</h4>
<p>The Paris stock exchange, the bourse, was open for trading only two
hours a day, 1 to 3 P.M., which was 7 to 9 A.M., New York time. So on
Monday, Sherman arrived at the bond trading room of Pierce andandandand
Pierce at 6:30. By now it was 7:30, and he was at his desk with his
telephone at his left ear and his right foot up on Felix’s portable
shoeshine stand.</p>
<p>The sound of young men baying for money on the bond market had
already risen in the room, for the market was now an international
affair. Across the way was the young lord of the pampas, Arguello, with
his telephone at his right ear and his left hand over his left ear,
talking to Tokyo in all probability. He had been in the office for at
least twelve hours when Sherman arrived, working on a huge sale of U.S.
Treasuries to the Japanese postal service. How this kid had ever even
gotten his finger into such a deal, Sherman couldn’t imagine, but there
he was. The Tokyo exchange was open from 7:30 P.M. to 4 A.M., New York
time. Arguello was wearing some kind of go-to-hell suspenders with
pictures of Tweety Pie, the cartoon character, on them, but that was all
right. He was working, and Sherman was at peace.</p>
<p>Felix, the shoeshine man, was humped over, stropping Sherman’s right
shoe, a New andandandand Lingwood half-brogue, with his high-shine rag.
Sherman liked the way the elevation of his foot flexed his leg and
sprung it out and put pressure on the inside of his thigh. It made him
feel athletic. He liked the way Felix humped over, shell-backed, as if
enveloping the shoe with his body and soul. He could see the top of the
black man’s head, which was no more than twenty inches below his eye
level. Felix had a perfectly round caramel-brown bald spot on the crown
of his skull, which was odd, since the hair surrounding it was quite
thick. Sherman liked this perfect round bald spot. Felix was dependable
and droll, not young, resentful, and sharp.</p>
<p>Felix had a copy of The City Light on the floor beside his stand,
reading it while he worked. It was open to the second page and folded
over in the middle. Page 2 contained most of The City Light’s
international news. The headline at the top said: BABY PLUNGES 200
FEET—AND LIVES. The dateline was Elaiochori, Greece. But that was all
right. The tabloids no longer held any terrors for Sherman. Five days
had now passed and there had not been a word in any of the newspapers
about some dreadful incident on an expressway ramp in the Bronx. It was
just as Maria had said. They had been drawn into a fight in the jungle,
and they had fought and won, and the jungle did not scream about its
wounded. This morning Sherman had bought only the Times at the little
shop on Lexington. He had actually read about the Soviets and the Sri
Lankans and the internecine strife at the Federal Reserve on the taxi
ride downtown, instead of turning at once to Section B, Metropolitan
News.</p>
<p>After a solid week of fear, he could now concentrate on the
radium-green numbers sliding across the black screens. He could
concentrate on the business at hand…the Giscard…</p>
<p>Bernard Levy, the Frenchman he dealt with at Traders’ Trust Co., was
now in France doing a last bit of research on the Giscard before Trader
T committed their 00 million and they closed the deal and had a
print…the crumbs…Judy’s contemptuous phrase slipped into his mind and
right out again…crumbs…So what?…They were crumbs of gold…He concentrated
on Levy’s voice on the other end of the satellite carom:</p>
<p>“So look, Sherman, here’s the problem. The debt figures the
government has just released have everybody on edge here. The franc is
falling, and it’s bound to fall further, and at the same time, as you
know, gold is falling, even though it’s for different reasons. The
question is where the floor’s going to be, and…”</p>
<p>Sherman just let him talk. It wasn’t unusual for people to get a
little squirrelly on the verge of committing a sum like 00 million. He
had spoken to Bernard—he called him by his first name—almost every day
for six weeks now, and he could barely remember what he looked like. My
French doughnut, he thought—and immediately realized this was Rawlie
Thorpe’s crack, Rawlie’s cynicism, sarcasm, pessimism, nihilism, which
were all ways of saying Rawlie’s weakness, and so he banished doughnut
as well as crumbs from his mind. This morning he was once more on the
side of strength and Destiny. He was almost ready to entertain, once
again, the notion of…mastery of the universe…The baying of the young
titans sounded all around him—</p>
<p>“I’m sixteen, seventeen. What does he want to do?”</p>
<p>“Bid me twenty-five of the ten-year!”</p>
<p>“I want out!”</p>
<p>—and once more it was music. Felix was stropping the high-shine rag
back and forth. Sherman enjoyed the pressure of the rag on his
metatarsal bones. It was a tiny massage of the ego, when you got right
down to it—this great strapping brown man with the bald spot in his
crown down there at his feet, stropping, oblivious of the levers with
which Sherman could move another nation, another continent, merely by
bouncing a few words off a satellite.</p>
<p>“The franc is no problem,” he said to Bernard. “We can hedge that to
next January or to term or both.”</p>
<p>He felt Felix tapping the bottom of his right shoe. He lifted his
foot off the stand, and Felix picked it up and moved it around to the
other side of his chair, and Sherman hoisted his mighty athletic left
leg and put his left shoe on the metal shoeshine stirrup. Felix turned
the newspaper over and folded it down the middle and put it on the floor
beside the stand and began to work on the left New andandandand Lingwood
half-brogue.</p>
<p>“Yes, but you have to pay for a hedge,” said Bernard, “and we’ve been
talking all along about operating under very blue skies, and…”</p>
<p>Sherman tried to imagine his doughnut, Bernard, sitting in an office
in one of those dinky modern buildings the French build, with hundreds
of tiny cars buzzing by and tooting their toy horns on the street down
below…below…and his eye happened to drift down to the newspaper on the
floor below…</p>
<p>The hair on his arms stood on end. At the top of the page, the third
page of The City Light, was a headline saying:</p>
<p>Honor Student’s Mom:</p>
<p>Cops Sit On Hit’N’Run</p>
<p>Above it in smaller white letters on a black bar it said: While he
lies near death. Below was another black bar saying, A CITY LIGHT
Exclusive. And below that: By Peter Fallow. And below that, set into a
column of type, was a picture, head and shoulders, of a smiling black
youth, neatly dressed in a dark jacket, a white shirt, and a striped
necktie. His slender delicate face was smiling.</p>
<p>“I think the only sensible thing is to find out where this thing
bottoms out,” said Bernard.</p>
<p>“Well…I think you’re exaggerating the, uh…the, uh…” That face! “…the,
uh…” That slender delicate face, now with a shirt and tie! A young
gentleman! “…the, uh, problem.”</p>
<p>“I hope so,” said Bernard. “But either way, it won’t hurt to
wait.”</p>
<p>“Wait?” Yo! You need any help! That frightened delicate face! A good
person! Did Bernard say “Wait”? “I don’t get it, Bernard. Everything’s
in place!” He hadn’t meant to sound so emphatic, so urgent, but his eyes
were fastened on the words lying on the floor below.</p>
<p>Fighting back tears, a Bronx widow told The City Light yesterday how
her honor-student son was run down by a speeding luxury sedan—and
accused police and the Bronx District Attorney’s Office of sitting on
the case.</p>
<p>Mrs. Annie Lamb, a clerk at the city Marriage Bureau, said her son,
Henry, 18, due to graduate with honors from Colonel Jacob Ruppert High
School next week, gave her part of the license number of the car—a
Mercedes-Benz—before he slipped into a coma.</p>
<p>“But the man from the District Attorney’s Office called the
information useless,” she said, on the grounds that the victim himself
was the only known witness.</p>
<p>Doctors at Lincoln Hospital termed the coma “probably irreversible”
and said Lamb’s condition was “grave.”</p>
<p>Lamb and his mother live in Edgar Allan Poe Towers, a Bronx housing
project. Described by neighbors and teachers as “an exemplary young
man,” he was slated to enter college in the fall.</p>
<p>The teacher of Lamb’s advanced literature and composition class at
Ruppert, Zane J. Rifkind, told The City Light: “This is a tragic
situation. Henry is among that remarkable fraction of students who are
able to overcome the many obstacles that life in the South Bronx places
in their paths and concentrate on their studies and their potential and
their futures. One can only wonder what he might have achieved in
college.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lamb said her son had left their apartment early last Tuesday
evening, apparently to buy food. While crossing Bruckner Boulevard, she
said, he was struck by a Mercedes-Benz carrying a man and a woman, both
white. The car did not stop. The neighborhood is predominantly black and
Hispanic.</p>
<p>Lamb managed to make his way to the hospital, where he was treated
for a broken wrist and released. The next morning he complained of a
severe headache and dizziness. He fell unconscious in the emergency
room. It was determined that he had suffered a subdural concussion.</p>
<p>Milton Lubell, spokesman for Bronx District Attorney Abe Weiss, said
detectives and an assistant district attorney had interviewed Mrs. Lamb
and that “an investigation is underway,” but that 2,500 Mercedes-Benzes
are registered in New York State with license plates beginning with R,
the letter provided by Mrs. Lamb. She said her son thought the second
letter was E, F, B, P, or R. “Even assuming one of those is the second
letter,” said Lubell, “we’re talking about almost 500 cars—</p>
<p>RF—Mercedes-Benz—the data on the pages of a million newspapers—went
through Sherman’s solar plexus like a tremendous vibration. His license
plate began: RFH. With a horrifying hunger for the news of his own doom,
he read on:</p>
<p>—and we have no description of a driver and no witnesses and</p>
<p>That was as much as he could read. Felix had folded the newspaper at
that point. The rest was on the lower half of the page. His brain was on
fire. He was dying to reach down and turn the newspaper over—and dying
never to have to know what it would reveal. Meantime, the voice of
Bernard Levy droned on from across the ocean, bouncing off an
ATandandandandT communications satellite.</p>
<p>“…talking ninety-six, if that’s what you mean by ‘in place.’ But
that’s beginning to look rather pricey, because…”</p>
<p>Pricey? Ninety-six? No mention of a second boy! No mention of a ramp,
a barricade, an attempted robbery! The price had always been set! How
could he bring that up now? Could it be—not a robbery attempt, after
all! He’d paid an average of ninety-four for them. Only a two-point
spread! Couldn’t lower it! This nice-looking lad dying! My car! Must
focus on it…the Giscard! Couldn’t fail, not after all this time—and the
tabloid sizzled on the floor.</p>
<p>“Bernard…” His mouth had gone dry. “Listen…Bernard…”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>But perhaps if he took his foot off the shoeshine stand—</p>
<p>“Felix? Felix?” Felix didn’t seem to hear him. The perfect
caramel-brown bald spot on the crown of his head continued to go back
and forth as he worked on the New andandandand Lingwood half-brogue.</p>
<p>“Felix!”</p>
<p>“Hello, Sherman! What did you say?” In his ear, the voice of the
French doughnut, sitting on top of 300 million gold-backed bonds—in his
eyes, the top of the head of a black man sitting on top of a shoeshine
stand and engulfing his left foot.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Bernard!…Just a moment…Felix?”</p>
<p>“You say Felix?”</p>
<p>“No, Bernard! I mean just a minute…Felix!”</p>
<p>Felix stopped working on the shoe and looked up.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Felix, I’ve got to stretch my leg a second.”</p>
<p>The French doughnut: “Hello, Sherman, I can’t understand you!”</p>
<p>Sherman took his foot off the stand and made a great show of
extending it, as if it felt stiff.</p>
<p>“Sherman, are you there?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Excuse me a second, Bernard.”</p>
<p>As he hoped, Felix took this opportunity to turn The City Light over
in order to read the lower half of the page. Sherman put his foot back
on the stand, and Felix hunched over the shoe again, and Sherman put his
head down, trying to focus on the words lying on the floor. He bent his
head down so close to Felix’s that the black man looked up. Sherman
pulled his head back and smiled weakly.</p>
<p>“Sorry!” he said.</p>
<p>“You say ‘Sorry’?” asked the French doughnut.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Bernard, I was talking to someone else.”</p>
<p>Felix shook his head reprovingly, then lowered it and went to work
again.</p>
<p>“ ‘Sorry’?” repeated the French doughnut, still baffled.</p>
<p>“Never mind, Bernard. I was talking to someone else.” Slowly Sherman
lowered his head again and fixed his eyes upon the print way down
below.</p>
<p>—no one who can tell us what happened, not even the young man
himself.”</p>
<p>“Sherman, are you there? Sherman—”</p>
<p>“Yes, Bernard. Sorry. Uh…tell me again what you were saying about
price? Because, really, Bernard, we’re all set on that. We’ve been all
set for weeks!”</p>
<p>“Again?”</p>
<p>“If you don’t mind. I was interrupted here.”</p>
<p>A big sigh, from Europe, by satellite. “I was saying that we’ve moved
from a stable to an unstable mix here. We can no longer extrapolate from
the figures we were talking about when you made your presentation…”</p>
<p>Sherman tried to pay attention to both things at once, but the
Frenchman’s words quickly became a drizzle, a drizzle by satellite, as
he devoured the print visible below the skull of the shoeshine man:</p>
<p>But the Rev. Reginald Bacon, chairman of the Harlem-based All
People’s Solidarity, called this “the same old story. Human life, if
it’s black human life or Hispanic human life, is not worth much to the
power structure. If this had been a white honor student struck down on
Park Avenue by a black driver, they wouldn’t be trifling with statistics
and legal obstacles.”</p>
<p>He called the hospital’s failure to diagnose Lamb’s concussion
immediately “outrageous” and demanded an investigation.</p>
<p>Meantime, neighbors came by Mrs. Lamb’s small, neatly kept apartment
in the Poe Towers to comfort her as she reflected upon this latest
development in her family’s tragic history.</p>
<p>“Henry’s father was killed right out there six years ago,” she told
The City Light, pointing toward a window overlooking the project’s
entry. Monroe Lamb, then 36, was shot to death by a mugger one night as
he returned from his job as an air-conditioning mechanic.</p>
<p>“If I lose Henry, that will be the end of me, too, and nobody will
care about that either,” she said. “The police never found out who
killed my husband, and they don’t even want to look for who did this to
Henry.”</p>
<p>But Rev. Bacon vowed to put pressure on the authorities until
something is done: “If the power structure is telling us it doesn’t even
matter what happens to our very best young people, the very hope of
these mean streets, then it’s time we had a message for the power
structure: ‘Your names are not engraved on tablets that came down from
the mountain. There’s an election coming up, and you can be
replaced.’”</p>
<p>Abe Weiss, Bronx District Attorney, faces a stiff challenge in
September’s Democratic primary. State Assemblyman Robert Santiago has
the backing of Bacon, Assemblyman Joseph Leonard, and other black
leaders, as well as the leadership of the heavily Puerto Rican southern
and central Bronx.</p>
<p>“…and so I say we let it sit for a few weeks, let the particles
settle. By then we’ll know where bottom is. We’ll know if we’re talking
about realistic prices. We’ll know…”</p>
<p>It suddenly dawned on Sherman what the frightened doughnut Frog was
saying. But he couldn’t wait—not with this thing closing in on him—had
to have a print—now!</p>
<p>“Bernard, now you listen. We can’t wait. We’ve spent all this time
getting everything in place. It doesn’t have to sit and settle. It’s
settled. We’ve got to move now! You’re raising phantom issues. We’ve got
to pull ourselves together and do it! We’ve thrashed out all these
things a long time ago! It doesn’t matter what happens to gold and
francs on a day-today basis!”</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, he recognized the fatal urgency in his voice. On
Wall Street, a frantic salesman was a dead salesman. He knew that! But
he couldn’t hold back—</p>
<p>“I can’t very well just close my eyes, Sherman.”</p>
<p>“Nobody’s asking you to.” Thok. A little tap. A tall, delicate boy,
an honor student! The terrible thought possessed his entire
consciousness: They really were only two well-meaning boys who wanted to
help… Yo!…The ramp, the darkness…But what about him—the big one? No
mention of a second boy at all…No mention of a ramp…It made no
sense…Only a coincidence perhaps!—another Mercedes!—R—2,500 of them—</p>
<p>But in the Bronx on that very same evening?</p>
<p>The horror of the situation smothered him all over again.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but we can’t do this one by Zen archery, Sherman. We’re
going to have to sit on the eggs for a while.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? How long is ‘a while,’ for God’s sake?”
Could they conceivably check out 2,500 automobiles?</p>
<p>“Well, next week or the week after. I’d say three weeks at the
outside.”</p>
<p>“Three weeks!”</p>
<p>“We have a whole series of big presentations coming up. There’s
nothing we can do about that.”</p>
<p>“I can’t wait three weeks, Bernard! Now look, you’ve let a few minor
problems—hell, they’re not even problems. I’ve covered every one of
those eventualities twenty goddamned times! You’ve got to do it now!
Three weeks won’t help a thing!”</p>
<p>On Wall Street, salesmen didn’t say got to, either.</p>
<p>A pause. Then the doughnut’s soft patient voice from Paris, by
satellite: “Sherman. Please. For 300 million bonds nobody’s got to do
anything on hot flashes.”</p>
<p>“Of course not, of course not. It’s just that I know I’ve explained…I
know I’ve…I know…”</p>
<p>He knew he had to talk himself down from this giddy urgent plateau as
quickly as possible, become the smooth calm figure from the fiftieth
floor at Pierce andandandand Pierce that the Trader T doughnut had
always known, a figure of confidence and unshakable puissance, but…it
was bound to be his car. No way out of it! Mercedes, RF, a white man and
woman!</p>
<p>The fire raged inside his skull. The black man stropped away on his
shoe. The sounds of the bond trading room closed in on him like the roar
of beasts:</p>
<p>“He’s seeing them at six! Your offering is five!”</p>
<p>“Bid out! The Feds are doing reverses!”</p>
<p>“Feds buying all coupons! Market subject!”</p>
<p>“Holy fucking shit! I want out!”</p>
<p>All was confusion in Part 62, Judge Jerome Meldnick presiding. From
behind the clerk’s table, Kramer gazed upon Meldnick’s bewilderment with
amused contempt. Up on the bench, Meldnick’s large pale head resembled a
Gouda cheese. It was bent over next to that of his law secretary,
Jonathan Steadman. Insofar as the judgeship of Jerome Meldnick had any
usable legal background, it was lodged in the skull of Steadman.
Meldnick had been executive secretary of the teachers’ union, one of the
largest and most solidly Democratic unions in the state, when the
governor appointed him as a judge in the criminal division of the State
Supreme Court in recognition of his jurisprudential potential and his
decades of dog’s work for the party. He had not practiced law since the
days when he ran errands, shortly after passing the bar, for his uncle,
who was a lawyer who handled wills and real-estate contracts and sold
title insurance out of a two-story taxpayer on Queens Boulevard.</p>
<p>Irving Bietelberg, the lawyer for a felon named Willie Francisco, was
on tiptoes on the other side of the bench, peering over and trying to
get a word in. The defendant himself, Francisco, fat, twenty-two,
wearing a wispy mustache and a red-and-white-striped sport shirt, was on
his feet yelling at Bietelberg: “Yo! Hey! Yo!” Three court officers were
positioned to the sides and rear of Willie, in case he got too excited.
They would have been happy to blow his head off, since he had killed a
cop without batting an eye. The cop had apprehended him when he came
running out of an optician’s with a pair of Porsche sunglasses in his
hand. Porsche sunglasses were much admired in the Morrisania section of
the Bronx, because they cost 50 a pair and had the name Porsche etched
in white on the upper rim of the left lens. Willie had gone into the
optician’s with a forged Medicaid prescription for glasses and announced
he wanted the Porsches. The clerk said he couldn’t have them, because
Medicaid wouldn’t reimburse the store for glasses that cost that much.
So Willie grabbed the Porsches and ran out and shot the cop.</p>
<p>It was a true piece a shit, this case, and an open-and-shut piece a
shit, and Jimmy Caughey hadn’t even had to breathe hard to win it. But
then this weird thing had happened. The jury had gone out yesterday
afternoon and after six hours had returned without reaching a verdict.
This morning Meldnick was plowing through his calendar session when the
jury sent in word they had reached a verdict. They came filing in, and
the verdict was guilty. Bietelberg, just doing the usual, asked that the
jury be polled. “Guilty,” “Guilty,” “Guilty,” said one and all until the
clerk got to an obese old white man, Lester McGuigan, who also said
“Guilty” but then looked into the Porscheless eyes of Willie Francisco
and said: “I don’t feel absolutely right about it, but I guess I have to
cast a vote, and that’s the way I cast it.”</p>
<p>Willie Francisco jumped up and yelled “Mistrial!” even before
Bietelberg could yell it—and after that all was confusion. Meldnick
wrapped his forearms around his head and summoned Steadman, and that was
where things stood. Jimmy Caughey couldn’t believe it. Bronx juries were
notoriously unpredictable, but Caughey had figured McGuigan was one of
his solid rocks. Not only was he white, he was Irish, a lifetime Bronx
Irishman who would certainly know that anyone named Jimmy Caughey was a
worthy young Irishman himself. But McGuigan had turned out to be an old
man with time on his hands who thought too much and waxed too
philosophical about things, even the likes of Willie Francisco.</p>
<p>Kramer was amused by Meldnick’s confusion but not Jimmy Caughey’s.
For Jimmy he had only commiseration. Kramer was in Part 62 with a
similar piece a shit and had similar ridiculous catastrophes to fear.
Kramer was on hand to hear a motion for an evidentiary hearing from the
lawyer, Gerard Scalio, in the case of Jorge and Juan Terzio, two
brothers who were “a couple of real dummies.” They had tried to hold up
a Korean grocery store on Fordham Road but couldn’t figure out which
buttons to hit on the cash register and settled for pulling two rings
off the fingers of a female customer. This so angers another customer,
Charlie Esposito, that he runs after them, catches up with Jorge,
tackles him, pins him to the ground, and says to him, “You know
something? You’re a couple of real dummies.” Jorge reaches inside his
shirt, pulls out his gun, and shoots him right in the face, killing
him.</p>
<p>A true piece a shit.</p>
<p>As the shitstorm grew louder and Jimmy Caughey rolled his eyes in
ever more hopeless arcs, Kramer thought of a brighter future. Tonight he
would meet her at last…the Girl with Brown Lipstick.</p>
<p>Muldowny’s, that restaurant on the East Side, Third Avenue at
Seventy-eighth Street…exposed brick walls, blond wood, brass, etched
glass, hanging plants…aspiring actresses who waited on
tables…celebrities…but informal and not very expensive, or that’s what
he heard…the electric burble of young people in Manhattan leading…the
Life…a table for two…He’s looking into the incomparable face of Miss
Shelly Thomas…</p>
<p>A small timid voice told him he shouldn’t do it, or not yet. The case
was over, so far as the trial went, and Herbert 92X had been duly
convicted, and the jury had been dismissed. So what was the harm in his
meeting a juror and asking her about the nature of the deliberations in
this case? Nothing…except that the sentence had not been handed down
yet, so that technically the case was not over. The prudent thing would
be to wait. But in the meantime Miss Shelly Thomas might…decompress…come
down from her crime high…no longer be enthralled by the magic of the
fearless young assistant district attorney with the golden tongue and
the powerful sternocleidomastoid muscles…</p>
<p>A strong manly voice asked him if he was going to play it safe and
small-time the rest of his life. He squared his shoulders. He would keep
the date. Damned right! The excitement in her voice! It was almost as if
she had been expecting him to call. She was there in that glass-brick
and white-pipe-railing MTV office at Prischker andandandand Bolka, in
the heart of the Life, still pulsing to the rogue beat of life in the
raw in the Bronx, still thrilling to the strength of those who were
manly enough to deal with the predators…He could see her, he could see
her…He closed his eyes tightly…Her thick brown hair, her alabaster face,
her lipstick…</p>
<p>“Hey, Kramer!” He opened his eyes. It was the clerk. “You got a phone
call.”</p>
<p>He picked up the telephone, which was on the clerk’s desk. Up on the
bench, Meldnick, in thick Gouda consternation, was still huddled with
Steadman. Willie Francisco was still yelling, “Yo! Hey! Yo!”</p>
<p>“Kramer,” said Kramer.</p>
<p>“Larry, this is Bernie. Have you seen The City Light today?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“There’s a big article on page 3 about this Henry Lamb case. Claims
the cops are dragging their feet. Claims we are, too. Says you told this
Mrs. Lamb the information she gave you was useless. It’s a big
article.”</p>
<p>“What!”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention you by name. Just says ‘the man from the District
Attorney’s Office.’”</p>
<p>“That’s absolute total bullshit, Bernie! I told her the fucking
opposite! I said it was a good lead she gave us! It was just that it
wasn’t enough to build a case out of.”</p>
<p>“Well, Weiss is going bananas. He’s ricocheting off the walls. Milt
Lubell’s coming down here every three minutes. What are you doing right
now?”</p>
<p>“I’m waiting for an evidentiary hearing in this Terzio brothers case,
the two dummies. The Lamb case! Jesus Christ. Milt said the other day
there was some guy, some fucking Englishman, calling up from The City
Light—but Jesus Christ, this is outrageous. This case is fucking fulla
holes. I hope you realize that, Bernie.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, listen, get a postponement on the two dummies and come
on down here.”</p>
<p>“I can’t. For a change, Meldnick is up on the bench holding his head.
Some juror just recanted his guilty vote in the Willie Francisco case.
Jimmy’s up here with smoke coming out of his ears. Nothing’s gonna
happen here until Meldnick can find someone to tell him what to do.”</p>
<p>“Francisco? Oh, f’r Chrissake. Who’s the clerk there, Eisenberg?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Lemme talk to him.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Phil,” said Kramer. “Bernie Fitzgibbon wants to talk to
you.”</p>
<p>While Bernie Fitzgibbon talked to Phil Eisenberg on the telephone,
Kramer went around the other side of the clerk’s table to gather up his
papers on the Terzio brothers. He couldn’t believe it. The poor widow
Lamb, the woman even Martin and Goldberg had such pity for—she turns out
to be a snake! Where was a newspaper? He was dying to get his hands on
it. He found himself near the court stenographer, or court reporter, as
the breed was actually called, the tall Irishman, Sullivan. Sullivan had
stood up from his stenotype machine, just below the brow of the judge’s
bench, and was stretching. Sullivan was a good-looking, thatchy-haired
man in his early forties, famous, or notorious, on Gibraltar for his
dapper dress. At the moment he was wearing a tweed jacket that was so
soft and luxurious, so full of heather glints from the Highlands, Kramer
knew he couldn’t have afforded it in a million years. From behind Kramer
came an old courthouse regular named Joe Hyman, the supervisor of court
reporters. He walked up to Sullivan and said, “There’s a murder coming
into this part. It’ll go daily. How about it?”</p>
<p>Sullivan said, “What? C’mon, Joe. I just got through a murder. Whadda
I want wit’ another murder? I’ll have to wagon-train. I got theater
tickets. Cost me thirty-five dollars apiece.”</p>
<p>Hyman said, “Awright, awright. What about the rape? There’s a rape
that’s gotta be covered.”</p>
<p>“Well, shit, Joe,” said Sullivan, “a rape—that’s a wagon-train, too.
Why me? Why do I always have to be the one? Sheila Polsky hasn’t stayed
with a jury for months. What about her?”</p>
<p>“She has a bad back. She can’t sit that long.”</p>
<p>“A bad back?” said Sullivan. “She’s twenty-eight years old, f’r
Chrissake. She’s a goldbrick. That’s all ’at’sa matter wit’ her.”</p>
<p>“All the same—”</p>
<p>“Look, we gotta have a meeting. I’m tired of always being the one. We
gotta talk about the assignments. We gotta confront the goof-offs.”</p>
<p>“Awright,” said Hyman. “I’ll tell you what. You take the rape and
I’ll put you in a half-a-day calendar part next week. Okay?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Sullivan. He wrapped his eyebrows around his
nose, as if facing one of the agonizing decisions of a lifetime. “You
think there’ll be daily copy on the rape?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Probably.”</p>
<p>Daily copy. Now Kramer knew why he resented Sullivan and his fancy
clothes. After fourteen years as a court reporter, Sullivan had achieved
the civil-service ceiling of 1,000 a year—4,500 more than Kramer
made—and that was just the base. On top of that, the court reporters
sold the transcripts page by page, at a minimum of .50 a page. “Daily
copy” meant that each defense lawyer and the assistant D.A., plus the
court, meaning the judge, wanted transcripts of each day’s proceedings,
a rush order that entitled Sullivan to a premium of or more. If there
were “multiple defendants”—and in rape cases there often were—it might
go up to 4 or 5 a page. The word was that last year, in a murder trial
involving a gang of Albanian drug dealers, Sullivan and another reporter
had split 0,000 for two and a half weeks’ work. It was nothing for these
characters to make 5,000 a year, 0,000 more than the judge and twice as
much as himself. A court reporter! An automaton at the stenotype
machine! He who can’t even open his mouth in a courtroom except to ask
the judge to have someone repeat a word or a sentence!</p>
<p>And here was himself, Larry Kramer, a graduate of Columbia Law, an
assistant D.A.—wondering if he was really going to be able to afford to
take a girl with brown lipstick to a restaurant on the Upper East
Side!</p>
<p>“Hey, Kramer.” It was Eisenberg, the clerk, lifting the telephone
toward him.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Bernie?”</p>
<p>“I straightened it out with Eisenberg, Larry. He’s gonna put the
Terzio brothers at the bottom of the calendar. Come on down here. We
gotta get something going on this fucking Lamb case.”</p>
<p>“The way the Yanks build their council flats, the lifts stop only on
every other floor,” said Fallow, “and they smell like piss. The lifts, I
mean. As soon as one enters—great fluffy fumes of human piss.”</p>
<p>“Why every other floor?” asked Sir Gerald Steiner, devouring this
tale of the lower depths. His managing editor, Brian Highridge, stood
beside him, similarly rapt. In the corner of the cubicle Fallow’s dirty
raincoat still hung on the plastic coatrack, and the canteen of vodka
was still cached in the slash pocket. But he had the attention, praise,
and exhilaration to deal with this morning’s hangover.</p>
<p>“To save money in the construction, I should imagine,” he said. “Or
to remind the poor devils they’re on the dole. It’s all well and good
for the ones who have flats on the floor where the lift stops, but the
other half have to take it to the floor above and walk down. In a
council flat in the Bronx it seems that’s a hazardous arrangement. The
boy’s mother, this Mrs. Lamb, told me she lost half her furniture when
she moved in.” The recollection brought a smile to Fallow’s lips, the
sort of wry smile that says that this is a sad story and yet one has to
admit it’s funny. “She brought the furniture up on the lift to the floor
above their flat. They had to carry each piece down the stairs, and each
time they returned to the floor above, something would be missing. It’s
a custom! When new people move into an off-floor, the natives nip their
belongings from beside the lift!”</p>
<p>The Dead Mouse and Highridge tried to choke back their laughter,
since after all it was a lot of unfortunate poor people they were
talking about. The Dead Mouse sat down on the edge of Fallow’s desk,
which indicated that he was pleased enough with all this to settle in
for a moment. Fallow’s soul expanded. What he saw before him was no
longer…the Dead Mouse…but Sir Gerald Steiner, the enlightened baron of
British publishing who had summoned him to the New World.</p>
<p>“Apparently it’s worth your life just to go down the stairs at all,”
he continued. “Mrs. Lamb told me I shouldn’t use them under any
circumstances.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” asked Steiner.</p>
<p>“It seems the staircases are the back streets of the council flats,
so to speak. The flats are stacked up in these great towers, you see,
and the towers are set this way and that”—he motioned with his hands to
indicate the irregular arrangement—“in what are intended to be parks. Of
course not a blade of grass survives, but in any case there are no
streets or alleys or byways or pubs or whatever between the buildings,
just these open blasted heaths. There’s no place for the natives to sin.
So they use the landings of the stairways. They do…everything…on the
landings of the stairways.”</p>
<p>The wide eyes of Sir Gerald and his managing editor were too much for
Fallow. They sent a surge of poetic license up his brain stem.</p>
<p>“I must confess, I couldn’t resist a look. So I decided to retrace
the route Mrs. Lamb and her son had taken when they first moved into the
Edgar Allan Poe Towers.”</p>
<p>In fact, after the warning, Fallow hadn’t dared go near the stairway.
But now lies, graphic lies, bubbled up into his brain at an intoxicating
rate. In his intrepid trip down the stairs he encountered every sort of
vice: fornication, crack smoking, heroin injection, dice games and
three-card monte, and more fornication.</p>
<p>Steiner and Highridge stared, agape and bug-eyed.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” said Highridge. “What did they do when they saw
you?”</p>
<p>“Nothing but slog away. In their sublime state, what was a mere
passing journalist?”</p>
<p>“It’s bloody Hogarth,” said Steiner. “Gin Lane. Except that it’s
vertical.”</p>
<p>Fallow and Highridge both laughed with enthusiastic appreciation of
this comparison.</p>
<p>“The Vertical Gin Lane,” said Highridge. “You know, Jerry, that
wouldn’t make a bad two-part series. Life-in-a-subsidized-slum sort of
thing.”</p>
<p>“Hogarth Up and Down,” said Steiner, wallowing a bit in his new role
as phrasemaker. “Or will the Americans have the faintest familiarity
with Hogarth and Gin Lane?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t think that’s any great problem,” said Highridge. “You
remember our story on the Bluebeard of Howard Beach. I’m sure they
didn’t have a ghost of an idea who Bluebeard was, but it can be
explained in a paragraph, and then they’re pleased about what they’ve
just learned. And Peter here can be our Hogarth.”</p>
<p>Fallow felt a slight stirring of alarm.</p>
<p>“On second thought,” said Steiner, “I’m not sure it’s such a good
idea.”</p>
<p>Fallow felt greatly relieved.</p>
<p>“Why not, Jerry?” asked Highridge. “I think you’ve really hit on
something.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I think it’s intrinsically an important story. But, you know,
they’re very sensitive about this sort of thing. If we did a story about
life in the white council flats, that would be all right, but I don’t
think there are any white council flats in New York. This is a very
delicate area and one that’s causing me some concern just now. We’re
already getting some rumblings from these organizations, accusing The
City Light of being anti-minority, to use their term. Now, it’s all
right to be a white newspaper—what could be more pure white than the
Times?—but it’s quite another thing to pick up that reputation. That
makes a great many influential people uneasy, including, I might say,
advertisers. I received a dreadful letter the other day from some outfit
calling itself the Third World Anti-Defamation League.” He dragged out
the term Anti-Defamation as if it were the most ludicrous concoction
imaginable. “What was that all about, Brian?”</p>
<p>“The Laughing Vandals,” said Highridge. “We had a picture on page one
last week of three black boys in a police station, laughing. They’d been
arrested for destroying the physical-therapy facilities in a school for
handicapped children. Sprayed petrol and lit matches. Lovely fellows.
The police said they were laughing about it after they brought them in,
and so I sent one of our photographers, Silverstein—he’s an
American—brazen little man—to go get a picture of them laughing.” He
shrugged, as if it had been a routine journalistic decision.</p>
<p>“The police were very cooperative. They brought them out of the
lockup, out by the front desk, so our man could get a picture of them
laughing, but when they saw Silverstein with his camera, they wouldn’t
laugh. So Silverstein told them a smutty joke. A smutty joke!” Highridge
began laughing before he could finish. “It was about a Jewish woman who
goes on a safari to Africa, and she’s kidnapped by a gorilla, and he
takes her up in a tree and rapes her, and he keeps her there for a
month, raping her day and night, and finally she escapes, and she makes
her way back to the United States, and she’s relating all this to
another woman, her best friend, and she breaks into tears. And the
friend says, ‘There, there, there, you’re all right now.’ And the woman
says, ‘That’s easy for you to say. You don’t know how I feel. He doesn’t
write…he doesn’t call…’ And the three boys start laughing, probably out
of embarrassment at this terrible joke, and Silverstein takes their
picture, and we ran it. ‘The Laughing Vandals.’”</p>
<p>Steiner exploded. “Oh, that’s rich! I shouldn’t laugh. Oh my God!
What did you say the chap’s name was? Silverstein?”</p>
<p>“Silverstein,” said Highridge. “You can’t miss him. Always goes about
with cuts on his face. He puts scraps of toilet paper on the cuts to
stop the bleeding. Always has toilet paper stuck to his face.”</p>
<p>“Cuts? What sort of cuts?”</p>
<p>“From a razor. Seems his father left him his straight razor when he
died. He insists on using it. Can’t get the hang of it. Cuts himself to
pieces every day. Fortunately, he can take pictures.”</p>
<p>Steiner was breathless with mirth. “The Yanks! Dear God, I love them!
Tells them a joke. Dear God, dear God…I do like a fellow with sand. Make
a note of this, Brian. Give him a rise in pay. Twenty-five dollars a
week. But for God’s sake, don’t tell him or anyone else what for. Tells
them a joke! Raped by a gorilla!”</p>
<p>Steiner’s love of yellow journalism, his awe of the “sand” that gave
journalists the courage to try such stunts, was so genuine, Fallow and
Highridge couldn’t help but laugh along with him. Steiner’s little face
was far from that of a Dead Mouse at this moment. The outrageous zest of
this American photographer, Silverstein, lent him life, even
radiance.</p>
<p>“All the same,” said Steiner, sobering up, “we’ve got this
problem.”</p>
<p>“I think we were perfectly justified,” said Highridge. “The police
assured us they had been laughing about it. It was their lawyer, one of
these Legal Aid people, I think they call them, who made a fuss, and he
probably got hold of this Anti-Defamation whatever-it-is.”</p>
<p>“The facts aren’t what matters, unfortunately,” Steiner said. “We
have to alter some perceptions, and I think this hit-and-run case is a
good place to start. Let’s see what we can do for this family, these
poor Lamb people. They already seem to have some support. This man
Bacon.”</p>
<p>“The poor Lambs,” said Brian Highridge. “Yes.” Steiner looked
puzzled; his turn of phrase had been inadvertent.</p>
<p>“Now, let me ask you, Peter,” said Steiner, “does the mother, this
Mrs. Lamb, strike you as a credible person?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Fallow. “She makes a good appearance, she’s
well-spoken, very sincere. She has a job, she seems very neat in her
habits—I mean, these council flats are squalid little places, but hers
is very orderly…pictures on the walls…sofa-with-end-tables sort of
thing…even a little-table-inside-the-front-door sort of thing.”</p>
<p>“And the boy—he’s not going to blow up in our faces, is he? I believe
he’s some sort of honor student?”</p>
<p>“By the standards of his school. I’m not sure how he would fare at
Holland Park Comprehensive.” Fallow smiled. This was a school in London.
“He’s never been in trouble with the police. That’s so unusual in these
council flats, they talk about it as if one’s bound to be impressed by
this remarkable fact.”</p>
<p>“What do the neighbors say about him?”</p>
<p>“Oh…that he’s a pleasant…well-behaved sort of boy,” said Fallow. In
fact, Fallow had gone straight to Annie Lamb’s apartment with Albert
Vogel and one of Reverend Bacon’s people, a tall man with a gold ring in
one ear, and had interviewed Annie Lamb and departed. But by now his
status as an intrepid explorer of the lower depths, Bronx version, was
so exalted in the eyes of his noble employer, he didn’t care to back off
just yet.</p>
<p>“Very well,” said Steiner. “What do we have as a follow-up?”</p>
<p>“Reverend Bacon—that’s what everybody calls him, Reverend
Bacon—Reverend Bacon is organizing a large demonstration for tomorrow.
It’s to protest—”</p>
<p>Just then Fallow’s telephone rang.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Ayyyy, Pete!” It was the unmistakable voice of Albert Vogel. “Things
are poppin’. Some kid just called Bacon, some kid down at the Motor
Vehicle Bureau.” Fallow began making notes. “This kid, he read your
story, and he took it upon himself to get on the computer down there,
and he claims he’s got it narrowed down to 124 cars.”</p>
<p>“A hundred and twenty-four? Can the police handle that?”</p>
<p>“Nothing to it—if they want to. They can check ’em out in a few days,
if they want to put the men on it.”</p>
<p>“Who is this…fellow?” Fallow detested the American habit of using the
word kid, which properly referred only to goats, to mean “young
person.”</p>
<p>“Just some kid who works there, some kid who figures the Lambs are
getting the usual raw deal. I told you that’s what I like about Bacon.
He galvanizes people who want to challenge the power structure.”</p>
<p>“How do I get in touch with this…fellow?”</p>
<p>Vogel gave him all the details, then said: “Now, Pete, listen to me a
second. Bacon just read your story and he liked it very much. Every
newspaper and TV station in town has been calling him, but he’s saving
this Motor Vehicle Bureau angle for you. It’s yours, exclusive. Okay?
But you gotta push it. You gotta run with the goddamned ball. You
understand what I’m saying?”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>After he hung up, Fallow smiled at Steiner and Highridge, who were
all eyes, nodded knowingly, and said: “Yesssss…I think we’re rolling.
That was a tipster at the Motor Vehicle Bureau, where they keep records
of all the license plates.”</p>
<p>It was just the way he had dreamed it would be. It was precisely that
way, it made him want to hold his breath for fear something would break
the spell. She was looking into his eyes from just a tiny table’s width
away. She was absorbed in his words, drawn into his magnetic field, so
far into it that he had the urge to slide his hands across the table and
slip his fingertips under hers—already!—just twenty minutes after he’s
met her—such electricity! But he mustn’t rush it, mustn’t destroy the
exquisite poise of this moment.</p>
<p>In the background were the exposed brick, the mellow highlights of
the brass, the pubby carved cataracts of the etched glass, the aerobic
voices of the young and swell. In the foreground, her great mane of dark
hair, the Berkshire autumn glow of her cheeks—in point of fact, he
realized, even in the midst of the magic, the autumnal glow was probably
makeup. Certainly the mauve-and-purple rainbows on her upper eyelids and
occipital orbits were makeup—but such was the nature of contemporary
perfection. From her lips, swollen with desire, glistening with brown
lipstick, came the words:</p>
<p>“But you were so close to him and practically yelling at him, and he
was giving you such murderous looks—I mean, weren’t you afraid he was
just going to jump up and—I don’t know—I mean, he did not look like a
nice person!”</p>
<p>“Ayyyyyyyyy,” said Kramer, dismissing mortal danger with a shrug of
his shoulders and a distention of his mighty sternocleidomastoid
muscles. “These characters are 90 percent show, although it’s a good
idea to keep your eye out for the other 10 percent. Hah hah, yes. The
main thing was, somehow I had to bring out Herbert’s violent side, so
everybody could see it. His lawyer, Al Teskowitz—well, I don’t have to
tell you, he’s not the greatest orator in the world, but that
don’t—doesn’t”—it was time to shift gears in the third person
singular—”necessarily make any difference in a criminal trial. Criminal
law is a thing unto itself, because the stakes are not money but human
life and human freedom, and I tell you, that sets off a lot of crazy
emotions. Teskowitz, believe it or not, can be a genius at messing up
the minds—manipulating a jury. He looks so woebegone himself—and it’s
calculated—oh, sure. He knows how to work up pity for a client. Half of
it is—what’s the term?—body language, I guess you’d call it. Maybe just
ham acting is what it is, but he knows how to do that one thing very
well, and I couldn’t let this idea that Herbert is a nice family man—a
family man!—just hang there in the air like some kind of pretty balloon,
you know. So what I figured was—”</p>
<p>The words were just gushing out, in torrents, all the marvelous
things about his bravery and talent for the fray that he had no one to
tell about. He couldn’t go on like this to Jimmy Caughey or Ray
Andriutti or, any longer, to his wife, whose threshold for crime highs
was by now a stone wall. But Miss Shelly Thomas—I must keep you high!
She drank it all in. Those eyes! Those glistening brown lips! Her thirst
for his words was bottomless, which was a good thing, because she wasn’t
drinking anything but designer water. Kramer had a glass of house white
wine and was trying to keep from gulping it, because he could already
tell this place was not as inexpensive as he had thought. Christ! His
goddamned mind was double-tracking a mile a minute! It was like a
two-track tape. On one track he was gushing out this speech about how he
handled the trial—</p>
<p>“—out of the corner of my eye I could see he was about to snap. The
string was pulled tight! I didn’t even know if I’d make it to the end of
my summation, but I was willing—”</p>
<p>—and on the second track he was thinking about her, the bill (and
they hadn’t even ordered dinner yet), and where he could possibly take
her (if!), and the crowd here at Muldowny’s. Jesus! Wasn’t that John
Rector, the anchorman of Channel 9 news, over there at that table up
near the front, by the exposed-brick wall? But no! He wouldn’t point
that out. Only space for one celebrity here—himself—victor over the
violent Herbert 92X and the clever Al Teskowitz. A young crowd, a
swell-looking crowd in here—the place was packed—perfect—couldn’t be
better. Shelly Thomas had turned out to be Greek. Bit of a
disappointment. He had wanted—didn’t know what. Thomas was her
stepfather’s name; he manufactured plastic containers in Long Island
City. Her own father was named Choudras. She lived in Riverdale with her
stepfather and her mother, worked for Prischker andandandand Bolka,
couldn’t afford an apartment in Manhattan, wanted one badly—no longer
could you find “some little place in Manhattan” (didn’t have to tell
him)—</p>
<p>“—thing is, juries in the Bronx are very unpredictable. I could tell
you what happened to one of the fellows in my office in court this
morning!—but you probably noticed what I’m talking about. I mean, you
get people who come into the jury box with their minds—how should I say
it?—set in a certain way. There’s a lot of Us versus Them, Them being
the police and prosecutors—but you probably picked up some of that.”</p>
<p>“No, actually I didn’t. Everybody was very sensible, and they seemed
to want to do the right thing. I didn’t know what to expect, but I was
very pleasantly surprised.”</p>
<p>Does she think I’m prejudiced? “No, I don’t mean—there are plenty of
good people in the Bronx, it’s just that some people have a chip on
their shoulder, and some very weird things happen.” Let’s move off this
terrain. “As long as we’re being candid, do you mind if I tell you
something? I was worried about you as a juror.”</p>
<p>“Me!” She smiled and seemed to blush clear through the makeup glow,
tickled pink to have been a factor in strategic thinking in Supreme
Court, the Bronx.</p>
<p>“Yes! It’s the truth! You see, in a criminal trial you learn to look
at things from a different perspective. It may be a warped perspective,
but it’s the nature of the beast. In a case like this one—you’re—well,
you added up as too bright, too well educated, too removed from the
world of a character like Herbert 92X, and therefore—and this is the
irony of it—too capable of understanding his problems, and like the
French say, ‘To understand all is to forgive all.’”</p>
<p>“Well, actually—”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying that’s fair or accurate, but that’s the way you learn
to look at things in these cases. Not you—but someone like you—can be
too sensitive.”</p>
<p>“But you didn’t challenge me. Is that the term?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. No, I didn’t. Well, for one thing, I don’t think it’s right to
challenge a juror just because he’s—she’s intelligent and well educated.
I mean, I’m sure you noticed there was nobody else from Riverdale on
your jury. There wasn’t even anybody else from Riverdale on your panel
during the voir dire. Everybody is always moaning over the fact that we
don’t get more educated jurors in the Bronx, and then when we get
one—well, it’s almost like wasting a resource or something to challenge
one just because you think she might be sensitive. Besides…” Did he dare
try it? He dared. “…I just…to be honest about it…I just wanted you on
that jury.”</p>
<p>He looked as deeply into those big mauve-rainbow eyes as he could and
put as honest and open a look on his face as he knew how and lifted his
chin, so she could see the fullness of his sternocleidomastoids.</p>
<p>She lowered her eyes and blushed clear through autumn in the
Berkshires again. Then she raised her eyes and looked deeply into
his.</p>
<p>“I did sort of notice you looking at me a lot.”</p>
<p>Me ’n’ every other regular in the courtroom!—but it wouldn’t do to
let her know about that.</p>
<p>“You did? I was hoping it wasn’t that obvious! God, I hope other
people didn’t notice it.”</p>
<p>“Hah hah! I think they did. You know the lady who was sitting next to
me, the black lady? She was a very nice person. She works for a
gynecologist, and she’s very sweet, very intelligent. I asked her for
her telephone number, and I told her I’d call her. Anyway, you want to
know what she said to me?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“She said, ‘I think that district attorney kind of likes you,
Shelly.’ She called me Shelly. We hit it off very well. ‘He can’t take
his eyes off you.’”</p>
<p>“She said that?” He broke into a smile.</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Did she resent it? I mean, oh my God. I didn’t think it was that
obvious!”</p>
<p>“No, she thought it was cute. Women like things like that.”</p>
<p>“It was that obvious, hunh?”</p>
<p>“It was to her!”</p>
<p>Kramer shook his head, as if in embarrassment, all the while pouring
his eyes into hers, and she was pouring hers right back into his. They
had already jumped over the moat, and rather effortlessly, too. He
knew—he knew!—he could slide his hands across the table and take her
fingertips in his, and she would let him, and it would all happen
without their eyes leaving one another’s, but he held back. It was too
perfect and going too well to take the slightest risk.</p>
<p>He kept shaking his head and smiling…ever more significantly…In fact,
he was embarrassed, although not over the fact that others had noticed
how possessed with her he had been in the courtroom. Where to go—that
was what he was embarrassed about. She didn’t have an apartment, and of
course there was no way in God’s world he could take her to his ant
colony. A hotel?—far too gross, and besides, how the hell could he
afford it? Even a second-rate hotel was almost a hundred dollars a room.
God only knew what this meal was going to cost. The menu had an artless
hand-lettered look that set off an alarm in Kramer’s central nervous
system: money. Somehow he knew, based on very little experience, that
this faux-casual shit spelled money.</p>
<p>Just then the waitress returned. “Have you had a chance to
decide?”</p>
<p>She was a perfect confection, too. Young, blond, curly-haired,
brilliant blue eyes, the perfect aspiring-actress type, with dimples and
a smile that said: “Well! I can see that you two have decided
something!” Or did it say, “I’m young, pretty, and charming, and I
expect a big tip when you pay your big bill”?</p>
<p>Kramer looked into her twinkling face, and then he looked into Miss
Shelly Thomas’s. He was consumed by feelings of lust and poverty.</p>
<p>“Well, Shelly,” he said, “you know what you’d like?”</p>
<p>It was the first time he had called her by her first name.</p>
<p>Sherman sat on the edge of one of the bentwood chairs. He was leaning
forward with his hands clasped between his knees and his head down. The
noxious, incriminating copy of The City Light lay on top of the oak
pedestal table like something radioactive. Maria sat in the other chair,
more composed but not exactly her old insouciant self, either.</p>
<p>“I knew it,” said Sherman, without looking at her, “I knew it at the
time. We should have reported it immediately. I can’t believe I’m—I
can’t believe we’re in this situation.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s too late now, Sherman. That’s spilt milk.”</p>
<p>He sat up straight and looked at her. “Maybe it’s not too late. What
you say is, you say you didn’t know until you read this newspaper that
you’d hit anyone.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sure,” said Maria. “Then how do I say it happened, this thing I
didn’t even know happened in the first place?”</p>
<p>“Just…tell what actually happened.”</p>
<p>“That’ll sound wonderful. Two boys stopped us and tried to rob us,
but you threw a tire at one of them, and I drove outta there like
a…a…hot-rodder, but I didn’t know I hit anybody.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s exactly what happened, Maria.”</p>
<p>“And who’s gonna believe it? You read that story. They’re calling
that boy some kinda honor student, some kinda saint. They don’t say
anything about the other one. They don’t even say anything about a ramp.
They’re talking about a little saint who went to get food for his
family.”</p>
<p>The terrible possibility flared up once more. What if the two boys
were only trying to help?</p>
<p>There sat Maria in a turtleneck jersey that brought out her perfect
breasts even at this moment. She wore a short checked skirt, and her
glistening legs were crossed, and one of her pair of pumps dangled off
the tip of her foot.</p>
<p>Beyond her was the make-do bed, and above the bed there was now a
second small oil painting, of a nude woman holding a small animal. The
brushwork was so atrociously crude, he couldn’t tell what kind of animal
it was. It could be a rat as easily as a dog. His misery made his eye
hang on it for a moment.</p>
<p>“You noticed it,” said Maria, attempting a smile. “You’re getting
better. Filippo gave it to me.”</p>
<p>“Terrific.” The question of why some greaseball artist might feel so
generous toward Maria no longer interested Sherman in the slightest. The
world had shrunk. “So what do you think we ought to do?”</p>
<p>“I think we ought to take ten deep breaths and relax. That’s what I
think.”</p>
<p>“And then what?”</p>
<p>“And then maybe nothing.” ’N thin mibby nuthun. “Sherman, if we tell
’em the truth, they’re gonna kill us. You understand that? They’re gonna
cut us up in little pieces. Right now they don’t know whose car it was,
they don’t know who was driving, they don’t have any witnesses, and the
boy himself is in a coma and it doesn’t look like he’s…he’s ever gonna
come to.”</p>
<p>`You`` were driving, thought Sherman. Don’t forget that part. It
reassured him to hear her say it. Then a jolt of fear: suppose she
denied it and said he was driving? But the other boy knew, wherever he
might be.</p>
<p>All he said, however, was: “What about the other boy? Suppose he
shows up.”</p>
<p>“If he was gonna show up, he woulda showed up by now. He’s not gonna
show up, because he’s a criminal.”</p>
<p>Sherman leaned forward and put his head down again. He found himself
staring at the shiny tops of his New andandandand Lingwood half-brogues.
The colossal vanity of his bench-made English shoes sickened him. What
availeth a man…He couldn’t remember the quotation. He could see the
pitiful brown moon on the crown of Felix’s skull…Knoxville…Why hadn’t he
moved to Knoxville long ago?…a simple Georgian house with a screen porch
at one end…</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Maria,” he said, without looking up. “I don’t think we
can outguess them. I think maybe we ought to get in touch with a
lawyer”—two lawyers, said a small voice in the back of his skull, since
I don’t know this woman and we may not be on the same side
forever—“and…come forward with what we know.”</p>
<p>“And stick our heads in the tiger’s mouth is what you mean.” ’N stick
uh bids in thuh tiguh’s mouth. Maria’s Southernism was beginning to get
on Sherman’s nerves. “I’m the one who was driving the car, Sherman, and
so I think it’s up to me to decide.”</p>
<p>I’m the one who was driving the car! She had said it herself. His
spirits lifted a bit. “I’m not trying to talk you into anything,” he
said. “I’m just thinking out loud.”</p>
<p>Maria’s expression grew softer. She smiled at him in a warm, almost
motherly fashion. “Sherman, let me tell you something. There’s two kinds
a jungles. Wall Street is a jungle. You’ve heard that, haven’t you? You
know how to handle yourself in that jungle.” The Southern breeze was
blowing past his ears—but it was true, wasn’t it? His spirits rose a bit
more. “And then there’s the other jungle. That’s the one we got lost in
the other night, in the Bronx. And you fought, Sherman! You were
wonderful!” He had to resist congratulating himself with a smile. “But
you don’t live in that jungle, Sherman, and you never have. You know
what’s in that jungle? People who are all the time crossing back and
forth, back and forth, back and forth, from this side of the law to the
other side, from this side to the other side. You don’t know what that’s
like. You had a good upbringing. Laws weren’t any kind of a threat to
you. They were your laws, Sherman, people like you and your family’s.
Well, I didn’t grow up that way. We were always staggering back and
forth across the line, like a buncha drunks, and so I know and it
doesn’t frighten me. And let me tell you something else. Right there on
the line everybody’s an animal—the police, the judges, the criminals,
everybody.”</p>
<p>She continued to smile warmly at him, like a mother who has let a
child in on a great truth. He wondered if she really knew what she was
talking about or whether she was just indulging in a little sentimental
reverse snobbery.</p>
<p>“So what are you saying?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I’m saying I think you ought to trust my instincts.”</p>
<p>Just then there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Who’s that?” said Sherman, going on red alert.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” said Maria. “It’s Germaine. I told her you’d be here.”
She got up to go to the door.</p>
<p>“You didn’t tell her what happened…”</p>
<p>“Of course not.”</p>
<p>She opened the door. But it wasn’t Germaine. It was a gigantic man in
an outlandish black outfit. He came walking in as if he owned the place,
took a quick look around the room, at Sherman, the walls, the ceiling,
the floor, and then at Maria.</p>
<p>“You Germaine Boll”—he was gasping for breath, apparently because he
had just walked up the stairs—“or Bowl?”</p>
<p>Maria was speechless. So was Sherman. The giant was young, white,
with a big crinkly black beard, a huge apoplectic-red face glistening
with perspiration, a black homburg with an absolutely flat brim, a
too-small black homburg perched way up on his huge head like a toy, a
rumpled white shirt buttoned at the throat, but no tie, and a shiny
black double-breasted suit with the right side of the jacket overlapping
the left, the way a woman’s jacket is usually made. A Hasidic Jew.
Sherman had often seen Hasidic Jews in the Diamond District, which was
on Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh Streets between Fifth and Sixth
Avenues, but he had never seen one so enormous. He was probably six feet
five, well over 250 pounds, grossly fat but powerfully built, bulging
out of his liverish skin like a length of bratwurst. He took off his
homburg. His hair was pasted down on his skull with perspiration. He hit
the side of his great head with the heel of his hand, as if he were
tamping it back into shape. Then he put his hat back on his head. It was
perched up so high, it looked as if it might fall off at any moment.
Perspiration rolled down the giant’s forehead.</p>
<p>“Germaine Boll? Bowl? Bull?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not,” said Maria. She had recovered. She was testy, already
on the attack. “She’s not here. What do you want?”</p>
<p>“You live here?” For such a big man, he had an oddly high-pitched
voice.</p>
<p>“Miss Boll isn’t here now,” said Maria, ignoring the question.</p>
<p>“You live here or she live here?”</p>
<p>“Look, we’re kinda busy.” Exaggerated patience. “Why don’t you try
later?” Challengingly: “How’d you get in this building?”</p>
<p>The giant reached into the right-hand pocket of his jacket and pulled
out an enormous ring of keys. There appeared to be scores of them. He
ran a great fat forefinger around the ruff of keys and stopped at one of
them and delicately lifted it with his forefinger and thumb.</p>
<p>“With this. Winter Real Estate.” Wid dis. Wint-tuh Reelastate. He had
a slightly Yiddish accent.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ll have to come back later and talk to Miss Boll.”</p>
<p>The giant didn’t budge. He looked around the apartment again. “You
don’t live here?”</p>
<p>“Now, listen—”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, it’s okay. We gonna paint in here.” With that the giant
stretched both his arms out, like wings, as if he were about to do a
swan dive, and walked over to a wall and faced it. Then he pressed his
left hand against the wall and sidled over and lifted his left hand and
pressed his right hand down on that spot and shuffled over to his left
until he was spread out in the swan-dive position again.</p>
<p>Maria looked at Sherman. He knew he was going to have to do
something, but he couldn’t imagine what. He walked over to the giant. In
as frosty and commanding a tone as he could create, just as the Lion of
Dunning Sponget would have done it, he said: “Just a minute. What are
you doing?”</p>
<p>“Measuring,” said the giant, still doing his swan-dive shuffle around
the wall. “Got to paint in here.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m very sorry, but we don’t have time for that now. You’ll
have to make your arrangements some other time.”</p>
<p>The enormous young man turned around slowly and put his hands on his
hips. He took a deep breath, so that he looked puffed up to about five
hundred pounds. On his face was the look of someone forced to deal with
a pest. Sherman had the sinking feeling that this monster was used to
such confrontations and, in fact, relished them. But the male battle was
now on.</p>
<p>“You live here?” asked the giant.</p>
<p>“I said we don’t have time for this,” said Sherman, trying to
maintain the Lion’s tone of cool command. “Now, be a good fellow and
leave and come back and do your painting some other time.”</p>
<p>“You live here?”</p>
<p>“In point of fact, I don’t live here, but I’m a guest here, and I
don’t—”</p>
<p>“You don’t live here and she don’t live here. What you doing
here?”</p>
<p>“That’s not your concern!” said Sherman, unable to control his anger
but feeling more helpless by the second. He pointed toward the door.
“Now, be a good fellow and leave!”</p>
<p>“You don’t belong here. Okay? We got a real problem.” We gottuh reel
problem. “We gottuh wrong people living in this building. This a
rent-control building, and the people, they turn around”—tuhn
arount—“and they rent the apartments to other people for a thousand, two
thousand dollars a month. The rent in this apartment here, it’s only 31
a month. See? Germaine Boll—but we never see huh here. How much you pay
huh?”</p>
<p>Such insolence! The male battle! What could he do? In most situations
Sherman felt like a big man, physically. Next to this outlandish
creature…He couldn’t possibly touch him. He couldn’t intimidate him. The
Lion’s cool commands had no effect. And beneath it all the very
foundations were rotten. He was at a complete moral disadvantage. He
didn’t belong here—and he had everything in the world to hide. And what
if this incredible monster was not actually from the Winter Real Estate
Company? Suppose—</p>
<p>Fortunately Maria intervened. “It so happens Miss Boll’s gonna be
here very shortly. In the meantime—”</p>
<p>“Okay! Good! I wait fuh huh.”</p>
<p>The giant began walking across the room like a rocking druid. He
stopped at the oak pedestal table, and with glorious casualness, he
lowered his tremendous heft into one of the bentwood chairs.</p>
<p>“All right!” said Maria. “That’s about enough!”</p>
<p>The giant’s response to that was to fold his arms and close his eyes
and lean back, as if to settle in for the duration. In that instant
Sherman realized he would truly have to do something, no matter what, or
else be stripped of all manhood. The male battle! He started to step
forward.</p>
<p>Craaaacccckkkk! All at once the monster was on the floor, on his
back, and the stiff brim of his homburg was cartwheeling crazily along
the rug. One leg of the chair was cracked almost in two, near the seat,
with the light wood underneath the exterior stain showing. The chair had
collapsed under his weight.</p>
<p>Maria was screaming. “Now look what you’ve done, you peckerwood! You
brood sow! You tub a lard!”</p>
<p>With much huffing and puffing, the giant righted himself and began
hoisting himself to his feet. His insolent pose was shattered. He was
red in the face, and the perspiration was pouring down again. He leaned
over to pick up his hat and almost lost his balance.</p>
<p>Maria continued on the attack. She pointed at the remains of the
chair. “I hope you realize you’re gonna have to pay for that!”</p>
<p>“Whaddaya whaddaya,” said the giant. “It don’t belong to you!” But he
was retreating. Maria’s reproaches and his own embarrassment were too
much for him.</p>
<p>“That’s gonna cost you five hundred dollars and a—and a lawsuit!”
said Maria. “That’s breaking and entering and entering and
breaking!”</p>
<p>The giant paused by the door and glowered, but it was all too much
for him. He went rocking out the door in great disarray.</p>
<p>As soon as she heard him clumping down the stairs, Maria closed the
door and locked it. She turned around and looked at Sherman and gave a
great whoop of laughter.</p>
<p>“Did…you…see…him…on…the…floor!” She was laughing so hard, she could
scarcely get the words out.</p>
<p>Sherman stared at her. It was true—she was right. They were different
animals. Maria had the stomach for…for whatever was happening to them.
She fought—with relish! Life was a fight on the line she was talking
about—and so what? He wanted to laugh. He wanted to share her animal joy
in the ludicrous scene they had just witnessed. But he couldn’t. He
couldn’t even manage a smile. He felt as if the very insulation of his
position in the world was unraveling. These…unbelievable people…could
now walk into his life.</p>
<p>“Craaaaassssssh!” said Maria, weeping with laughter. “Oh God, I wish
I had a videotape a that!” Then she caught the look on Sherman’s face.
“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“What do you think that was all about?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘all about’?”</p>
<p>“What do you think he was doing here?”</p>
<p>“The landlord sent him. You remember that letter I showed you.”</p>
<p>“But isn’t it kind of odd that—”</p>
<p>“Germaine pays only 31 a month, and I pay her 50. It’s
rent-controlled. They’d love to get her out of here.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t strike you as odd that they’d decide to barge in
here—right now?”</p>
<p>“Right now?”</p>
<p>“Well, maybe I’m crazy, but today—after this thing is in the
paper?”</p>
<p>“In the paper?” Then it dawned on her what he was saying, and she
broke into a smile. “Sherman, you are crazy. You’re paranoid. You know
that?”</p>
<p>“Maybe I am. It just seems like a very odd coincidence.”</p>
<p>“Who do you think sent him in here, if the landlord didn’t? The
police?”</p>
<p>“Well…” Realizing it did sound rather paranoid, he smiled
faintly.</p>
<p>“The police are gonna send a colossal great Hasidic piece-a-blubber
moron lunatic to spy on you?”</p>
<p>Sherman hung his mighty Yale chin down over his collarbone. “You’re
right.”</p>
<p>Maria walked over and lifted his chin with her forefinger and looked
into his eyes and smiled the most loving smile he had ever seen.</p>
<p>“Sherman.” Shuhmun. “The entire world isn’t standing still thinking
about you. The entire world isn’t out to get you. Only I am.”</p>
<p>She took his face in both hands and kissed him. They ended up on the
bed, but this time it took some doing on his part. It wasn’t the same
when you were scared half to death.</p>
