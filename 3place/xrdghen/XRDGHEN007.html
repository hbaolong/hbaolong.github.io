<h4 id="a-leader-of-the-people">6. A Leader of the People</h4>
<p>The next morning Sherman McCoy experienced something that was new to
him in the eight years he had been at Pierce andandandand Pierce. He was
unable to concentrate. Ordinarily, as soon as he entered the bond
trading room and the glare from the plate glass hit him and the roar of
a legion of young men crazed by greed and ambition engulfed him,
everything else in his life fell away and the world became the little
green symbols that slid across the black screens of the computer
terminals. Even on the morning after the most stupid telephone call he
had ever made, the morning he woke up wondering if his wife was going to
leave him and take the most precious thing in his life with her, namely,
Campbell—even on that morning he had walked into the bond trading room
and, just like that, human existence had narrowed down to French
gold-backed bonds and U.S. government twenty-years. But now it was as if
he had a two-track tape in his skull and the mechanism kept jumping from
one track to the other without his having any control over it. On the
screen:</p>
<p>“U Frag 10.1 ’96 102.” Down a whole point! The United Fragrance
thirteen-year bonds, maturing in 1996, had slipped from 103 to 102.5
yesterday. Now, at 102, the yield would be 9.75 percent—and the question
he asked himself was:</p>
<p>Did it have to be a person that the car hit when she backed up? Why
couldn’t it have been the tire or a trash can or something else
entirely? He tried to feel the jolt again in his central nervous system.
It was a…thok…a little tap. It really hadn’t been much. It could have
been almost anything. But then he lost heart. What else could it have
been but that tall skinny boy?—and then he could see that dark delicate
face, the mouth hanging open with fear…It wasn’t too late to go to the
police! Thirty-six hours—forty by now—how would he put it? I think that
we—that is, my friend Mrs. Ruskin and I—may have—for God’s sake, man,
get hold of yourself! After forty hours it wouldn’t be reporting an
accident, it would be a confession! You’re a Master of the Universe. You
aren’t on the fiftieth floor at Pierce andandandand Pierce because you
cave in under pressure. This happy thought steeled him for the task at
hand, and he focused again on the screen.</p>
<p>The numbers were sliding across in lines, as if a radium-green brush
were painting them, and they had been sliding across and changing right
before his eyes but without registering in his mind. That startled him.
United Fragrance was down to 101 7/8, meaning the yield was up to almost
10 percent. Was something wrong? But just yesterday he had run it by
Research, and United Fragrance was in good shape, a solid AA. Right now
all he needed to know was:</p>
<p>Was there anything in The City Light? It sizzled on the floor at his
feet. There had been nothing in The Times, the Post, and the Daily News,
which he had gone through in the taxi on the way down. The first edition
of The City Light, an afternoon newspaper, didn’t come out until after
10 A.M. So twenty minutes ago he had given Felix, the shoeshine man,
five dollars to go downstairs and bring The City Light to him. But how
could he possibly read it? He couldn’t even let himself be seen with it
on top of his desk. Not him; not after the tongue-lashing he had given
young Señor Arguello. So it was under the desk, on the floor, sizzling
at his feet. It sizzled, and he was on fire. He burned with a desire to
pick it up and go through it…right now…and the hell with what it looked
like…But of course that was irrational. Besides, what difference would
it make whether he read it now or six hours from now? What could it
possibly change? Not very much, not very much. And then he burned some
more, until he thought he couldn’t stand it.</p>
<p>Shit! Something was happening with the United Fragrance
thirteen-years! They were back up to 102! Other buyers were spotting the
bargain! Act fast! He dialed Oscar Suder’s number in Cleveland, got his
aide-de-camp, Frank…Frank…What was his last name?…Frank…Frank the
doughnut…“Frank? Sherman McCoy at Pierce andandandand Pierce. Tell Oscar
I can get him United Fragrance ten-tens of ’96 yielding 9.75, if he’s
interested. But they’re moving up.”</p>
<p>“Hold on.” In no time the doughnut was back. “Oscar’ll take
three.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Fine. Three million United Fragrance ten-point-tens
of’96.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Frank, and best to Oscar. Oh, and tell him I’ll be back to
him before long about the Giscard. The franc is down a bit, but that’s
easy to hedge. Anyway, I’ll talk to him.”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell him,” said the doughnut in Cleveland—</p>
<p>—and even before he finished writing out the order chit and handed it
to Muriel, the sales assistant, he was thinking: Maybe I should see a
lawyer. I should call Freddy Button. But he knew Freddy too well. Freddy
was at Dunning Sponget, after all. His father had steered him to Freddy
in the first place—and suppose he said something to the Lion? He
wouldn’t—or would he? Freddy regarded himself as a family friend. He
knew Judy, and he asked about Campbell whenever they chatted, even
though Freddy was probably homosexual. Well, homosexuals could care
about children, couldn’t they? Freddy had children of his own. That
didn’t mean he wasn’t a homosexual, however—Christ! what the hell did it
matter, Freddy Button’s sex life? It was crazy to let his mind wander
like this. Freddy Button. He would feel like a fool if he told this
whole story to Freddy Button and it turned out to be a false alarm…which
it probably was. Two young thugs had tried to rob him and Maria, and
they had gotten what was coming to them. A fracas in the jungle, by the
rules of the jungle; that was all that had occurred. For a moment he
felt good about himself all over again. The law of the jungle! The
Master of the Universe!</p>
<p>Then the bottom dropped out. They had never overtly threatened him.
Yo! Need some help? And Maria had probably hit him with the car. Yes, it
was Maria. I wasn’t driving. She was driving. But did that absolve him
of responsibility in the eyes of the law? And did—</p>
<p>What was that? On the screen, United Fragrance ten-point-tens of ’96
blipped up to 102 1/8. Ah! That meant he’d just gained a quarter of a
percentage point on three million bonds for Oscar Suder by acting fast.
He’d let him know that tomorrow. Would help ice the Giscard—but if
anything happens with the…thok…the tall delicate boy…The little green
symbols glowed radioactively on the screen. They hadn’t budged for at
least a minute. He couldn’t stand it any longer. He would go to the
bathroom. There was no law against that. He took a big manila envelope
off his desk. The flap had a string that you wrapped around a paper disk
in order to close the envelope. It was the sort of envelope that was
used to relay documents from one office to another. He panned across the
bond trading room to see if the coast was clear, then put his head under
the desk and stuffed The City Light into the envelope and headed for the
bathroom.</p>
<p>There were four cubicles, two urinals, and a large sink. In the
cubicle he was dreadfully aware of the rustle of the newspaper as he
took it out of the envelope. How could he possibly turn the pages? Every
rustling crinkling crackling turn of the page would be a thunderous
announcement that some slacker was in here goofing on a newspaper. He
pulled his feet in toward the china base of the toilet bowl. That way no
one could get a glimpse under the cubicle door of his half-brogued New
andandandand Lingwood shoes with the close soles and the beveled insteps
and conclude, “Aha! McCoy.”</p>
<p>Hidden behind the toilet door, the Master of the Universe began
ransacking the newspaper at a furious clip, page by filthy page.</p>
<p>There was nothing, no mention of a boy struck down on a highway ramp
in the Bronx. He felt vastly relieved. Almost two full days had now
passed—and nothing. Christ, it was hot in here. He was perspiring
terribly. How could he let himself get carried away like this? Maria was
right. The brutes had attacked, and he had beaten the brutes, and they
had escaped, and that was that. With his bare hands he had
triumphed!</p>
<p>Or was it that the boy had been hit and the police were looking for
the car, but the newspapers didn’t regard it as important enough to rate
a story?</p>
<p>The fever began to rise again. Suppose something did get in the
papers…even a hint…How could he ever put the Giscard deal together under
a cloud like that?…He’d be finished!…finished!…And even as he quaked
with fear of such a catastrophe, he knew he was letting himself wallow
in it for a superstitious reason. If you consciously envisioned
something that dreadful, then it couldn’t possibly take place, could
it…God or Fate would refuse to be anticipated by a mere mortal, wouldn’t
He…He always insisted on giving His disasters the purity of surprise,
didn’t He…And yet—and yet—some forms of doom are so obvious you can’t
avoid them that way, can you! One breath of scandal—</p>
<p>—his spirits plunged even lower. One breath of scandal, and not only
would the Giscard scheme collapse but his very career would be finished!
And what would he do then? I’m already going broke on a million dollars
a year! The appalling figures came popping up into his brain. Last year
his income had been 80,000. But he had to pay out 1,000 a month for the
.8 million loan he had taken out to buy the apartment. What was 1,000 a
month to someone making a million a year? That was the way he had
thought of it at the time—and in fact, it was merely a crushing,
grinding burden—that was all! It came to 52,000 a year, none of it
deductible, because it was a personal loan, not a mortgage. (The
cooperative boards in Good Park Avenue Buildings like his didn’t allow
you to take out a mortgage on your apartment.) So, considering the
taxes, it required 20,000 in income to pay the 52,000. Of the 60,000
remaining of his income last year, 4,400 was required for the
apartment’s monthly maintenance fees; 16,000 for the house on Old
Drover’s Mooring Lane in Southampton (4,000 for mortgage payment and
interest, 8,000 for heat, utilities, insurance, and repairs, ,000 for
lawn and hedge cutting, ,000 for taxes). Entertaining at home and in
restaurants had come to 7,000. This was a modest sum compared to what
other people spent; for example, Campbell’s birthday party in
Southampton had had only one carnival ride (plus, of course, the
obligatory ponies and the magician) and had cost less than ,000. The
Taliaferro School, including the bus service, cost ,400 for the year.
The tab for furniture and clothes had come to about 5,000; and there was
little hope of reducing that, since Judy was, after all, a decorator and
had to keep things up to par. The servants (Bonita, Miss Lyons, Lucille
the cleaning woman, and Hobie the handyman in Southampton) came to 2,000
a year. That left only 26,200, or 8,850 a month, for additional taxes
and this and that, including insurance payments (nearly a thousand a
month, if averaged out), garage rent for two cars (40 a month),
household food (,500 a month), club dues (about 50 a month)—the abysmal
truth was that he had spent more than 80,000 last year. Well, obviously
he could cut down here and there—but not nearly enough—if the worst
happened! There was no getting out from under the .8 million loan, the
crushing 1,000-a-month nut, without paying it off or selling the
apartment and moving into one far smaller and more modest—an
impossibility! There was no turning back! Once you had lived in a .6
million apartment on Park Avenue—it was impossible to live in a million
apartment! Naturally, there was no way to explain this to a living soul.
Unless you were a complete fool, you couldn’t even make the words come
out of your mouth. Nevertheless—it was so! It was…an impossibility! Why,
his building was one of the great ones built just before the First World
War! Back then it was still not entirely proper for a good family to
live in an apartment (instead of a house). So the apartments were built
like mansions, with eleven-, twelve-, thirteen-foot ceilings, vast entry
galleries, staircases, servants’ wings, herringbone-parquet floors,
interior walls a foot thick, exterior walls as thick as a fort’s, and
fireplaces, fireplaces, fireplaces, even though the buildings were all
built with central heating. A mansion!—except that you arrived at the
front door via an elevator (opening upon your own private vestibule)
instead of the street. That was what you got for .6 million, and anyone
who put one foot in the entry gallery of the McCoy duplex on the tenth
floor knew he was in…one of those fabled apartments that the world, le
monde, died for! And what did a million get you today? At most, at most,
at most: a three-bedroom apartment—no servants’ rooms, no guest rooms,
let alone dressing rooms and a sunroom—in a white-brick high-rise built
east of Park Avenue in the 1960s with 8½-foot ceilings, a dining room
but no library, an entry gallery the size of a closet, no fireplace,
skimpy lumberyard moldings, if any, plasterboard walls that transmit
whispers, and no private elevator stop. Oh no; instead, a mean
windowless elevator hall with at least five pathetically plain
bile-beige metal-sheathed doors, each protected by two or more ugly drop
locks, opening upon it, one of these morbid portals being yours.</p>
<p>Patently…an impossibility!</p>
<p>He sat with his 50 New andandandand Lingwood shoes pulled up against
the cold white bowl of the toilet and the newspaper rustling in his
trembling hands, envisioning Campbell, her eyes brimming with tears,
leaving the marbled entry hall on the tenth floor for the last time,
commencing her descent into the lower depths.</p>
<p>Since I’ve foreseen it, God, you can’t let it happen, can you?</p>
<p>The Giscard!…Had to move fast! Had to have a print!…This phrase
suddenly possessed his mind, have a print. When a big deal such as the
Giscard was completed, closed, once and for all, it was set down in the
form of a contract that was actually printed by a printing company, on a
press. Have a print! Have a print!</p>
<p>He sat there, riding a white china toilet bowl, beseeching the
Almighty for a print.</p>
<p>Two young white men sat in a mansion in Harlem staring at a
middle-aged black man. The younger one, the one doing the talking, was
rattled by what he saw. He felt as if he had been removed from his own
body by astral projection and was listening like a spectator to his own
words as they came out of his mouth.</p>
<p>“So I don’t know exactly how to put it, Reverend Bacon, but the thing
is, we—I mean the diocese—the Episcopal Church—we’ve given you 50,000 as
seed money for the Little Shepherd Day Care Center, and we received a
telephone call yesterday from a newspaper reporter, and he said the
Human Resources Administration turned down your license application nine
weeks ago, and I mean, well, we just couldn’t believe it. It was the
first thing we’d even heard about it, and so…”</p>
<p>The words continued to come out of his mouth, but the young man,
whose name was Edward Fiske III, was no longer thinking about them. His
voice was on automatic, while his mind tried to make sense out of the
situation he was in. The room was a vast Beaux Arts salon full of
high-grained oak architraves and cornices and plaster rosettes and swags
with gilt highlights and fluted corner beads and ogeed baseboards, all
of it carefully restored to the original turn-of-the-century style. It
was the sort of mansion the dry-goods barons used to erect in New York
before the First World War. But now the baron of these premises, seated
behind a huge mahogany desk, was a black man.</p>
<p>His high-backed swivel chair was upholstered in a rich
oxblood-colored leather. There wasn’t a trace of emotion on his face. He
was one of those thin, rawboned men who look powerful without being
muscular. His receding black hair was combed straight back for about two
inches before it broke into ruffles of small curls. He wore a black
double-breasted suit with peaked lapels, a white shirt with a high
starched spread collar, and a black necktie with broad white diagonal
stripes. On his left wrist was a watch with enough gold to read a meter
by.</p>
<p>Fiske became unnaturally aware of the sound of his own voice: “…and
then we made—actually, I made—a telephone call to the HRA, and I spoke
to a Mr. Lubidoff, and he told me—and I’m only repeating to you what he
said—he said that several—actually, he said seven—he said seven of the
nine directors of the Little Shepherd Day Care Center have prison
records, and three are on parole, which means that technically,
legally”—he glanced at his young colleague, Moody, who was a
lawyer—“they are considered or accorded or, I should say, burdened with
the status of an inmate.”</p>
<p>Fiske stared at Reverend Bacon and opened his eyes wide and arched
his eyebrows. It was a desperate attempt to coax the baron into the
conversational vacuum. He didn’t dare try to question him, interrogate
him. The best he could hope for was to lay down certain facts that would
compel him, through the logic of the situation, to respond.</p>
<p>But Reverend Bacon didn’t even change his expression. He just stared
at the young man as if he were looking at a gerbil on a treadmill in a
cage. The narrow mustache that outlined his upper lip didn’t budge. Then
he began drumming the first two fingers of his left hand on his desk, as
if to say, “And therefore?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t Reverend Bacon but Fiske himself who couldn’t bear the
vacuum and plunged in.</p>
<p>“And therefore—well, I mean, in the eyes of the HRA—the way they look
at it—and they’re the licensing authority for day-care centers—and
you’re aware of all the furor—how sensitive they are about day-care
centers—it’s a big political issue—that three directors of the Little
Shepherd Day Care Center, the ones still on parole, they are still in
prison, because people on parole are still serving a prison sentence and
are still subject to all the…all the…well, whatever…and the other four
also have records, which by itself is enough to…to…Well, the regulations
don’t allow it—”</p>
<p>The words were gushing out in awkward spurts, while his mind rushed
all over the room, trying to find an exit. Fiske was one of those
superbly healthy white people who retain the peachy complexion of a
thirteen-year-old until well into their late twenties. Just now his fine
fair face was beginning to redden. He was embarrassed. No, he was
scared. In a few moments he was going to have to get to the part about
the 50,000, unless his sidekick over here, Moody, the lawyer, did it for
him. God almighty, how had it come to this? After leaving Yale, Fiske
had gone to the Wharton School of Business, where he had written a
master’s thesis entitled “Quantitative Aspects of Ethical Behavior in a
Capital-Intensive Corporation.” For the past three years he had been
Community Outreach Director of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, a
position that involved him in the diocese’s heavy moral and financial
support of Reverend Bacon and his works. But even in the auspicious
heartwarming early days, two years ago, he had been uneasy about these
trips to this big old town house in Harlem. From the beginning, a
thousand little things had snapped away at the ankles of his profound
intellectual liberalism, starting with this business of “Reverend
Bacon.” Every Yale man, or certainly every Episcopalian among them, knew
that Reverend was an adjective, not a noun. It was like Honorable before
the name of a legislator or a judge. You might refer to “the Honorable
William Rehnquist,” but you wouldn’t call him “Honorable Rehnquist.” In
the same way, you could refer to “the Reverend Reginald Bacon” or “the
Reverend Mr. Bacon,” but you wouldn’t say “Reverend Bacon”—except in
this house and in this part of New York, where you called him whatever
he wanted to be called, and you forgot about Yale. The truth was, Fiske
had found Reverend Bacon forbidding even in those early days when he had
been all smiles. They agreed on practically all philosophical and
political issues. Yet they were in no way similar people. And these were
not the early days. These were what you might call the last days.</p>
<p>“…And so, obviously we have a problem, Reverend Bacon. Until we can
get this straightened out about the license—and I wish we had known
about it nine weeks ago, when it happened—well, I don’t see that there’s
any way the project can go forward until we resolve it. Not that it
can’t be resolved, of course—but you’ve got to—well, the first thing
we’ve got to do, it seems to me, we’ve got to be very realistic about
the 50,000. Naturally, this board—I mean, your present board—this board
can’t spend any of those moneys on the day-care center, because the
board will have to be reorganized, it seems to me, which, when you get
right down to it, means a reorganization of the corporation, and that
will take some time. Not a lot of time, perhaps, but it will take some
time, and…”</p>
<p>As his voice struggled on, Fiske cut his eyes toward his colleague.
This fellow Moody didn’t seem fazed at all. He sat there in an armchair,
with his head cocked to one side, very coolly, as if he had Reverend
Bacon’s number. This was his first trip up to the House of Bacon, and he
seemed to regard it as a bit of a lark. He was the latest junior member
whom the firm of Dunning Sponget andandandand Leach had fobbed off on
the diocese, an account they regarded as prestigious but “soft.” On the
way up in the car, the young lawyer had told Fiske that he, too, had
gone to Yale. He had been a linebacker on the football team. He managed
to mention that about five different times. He had come walking into
Reverend Bacon’s headquarters as if he had a keg of Dortmunder Light
between his legs. He had sat down in the chair and leaned back,
gloriously relaxed. But he said nothing…“So in the meantime, Reverend
Bacon,” said Ed Fiske, “we thought the prudent thing would be—we talked
this over at the diocese—this was everybody’s thought on the thing, not
just mine—we thought the wise thing—I mean, all we’re concerned about
here is the future of the project, of the Little Shepherd Day Care
Center—because we’re still a hundred percent behind the project—that
hasn’t changed a bit—we thought the prudent thing would be to place the
50,000—not counting the money that’s already gone toward leasing the
building on West 129th Street, of course—we ought to put the
other—what?—40,000, or whatever it is, into an escrow account, and then
when you’ve gotten the business of the board of directors straightened
out, and you’ve gotten the licensing from the HRA, and there’s no more
red tape to worry about, those moneys will be turned over to you and
your new board, and, well, that’s…sort of it!”</p>
<p>Fiske opened his eyes wide again and arched his eyebrows and even
attempted a little friendly smile, as if to say, “Hey! We’re all in the
same boat here, aren’t we!” He looked at Moody, who continued to stare
at Reverend Bacon in his cool fashion. Reverend Bacon didn’t even so
much as blink, and something about that implacable gaze made Fiske
decide that it was unwise to continue looking into his eyes. He looked
at Reverend Bacon’s fingers as they did their paradiddle on the desk.
Not a word. So he scanned the top of the desk. There was a large
handsome leather-bound desk blotter, a gold Dunhill pen-and-pencil set
mounted on an onyx pedestal, a collection of paperweights and medals
imbedded in Lucite, several of which had been inscribed to Reverend
Reginald Bacon by civic organizations, a stack of papers held down by a
paperweight consisting mainly of the letters WNBC-TV in thick brass, an
intercom with a row of buttons, and a large box-shaped ashtray with
leather sides framed in brass and a brass grillwork over the top…</p>
<p>Fiske kept his eyes lowered. Into the vacuum came the sounds of the
building. On the floor above, heavily muffled by the building’s thick
floors and walls, the faint sound of a piano…Moody, sitting right next
to him, probably didn’t even notice. But Fiske, in his mind, could sing
right along with those rich crashing cords.</p>
<p>“The mil-len-ni-al rei-eign…</p>
<p>“Is going…to be…”</p>
<p>Huge chords.</p>
<p>“One thousand years of…e-ter-ni-tee…</p>
<p>“Lord of lo-ords…”</p>
<p>“Ho-ost of hosts…”</p>
<p>More chords. A whole ocean of chords. She was up there right now.
When this thing first started, this business of the diocese and Reverend
Bacon, Fiske used to play Reverend Bacon’s mother’s records in his
apartment at night and sing along, at the top of his lungs, with
ecstatic abandon—“The mil-len-ni-al rei-eiggn!”—a song made famous by
Shirley Caeser…oh, he knew his gospel singers—him!—Edward Fiske III,
Yale ’80!—who now had legitimate entry into that rich black world…The
name Adela Bacon still appeared on the gospel music charts from time to
time. Of all the organizations listed in the mansion’s entry hall down
below, ALL PEOPLE’S SOLIDARITY, THE GATES OF THE KINGDOM CHURCH, THE
OPEN GATES EMPLOYMENT COALITION, MOTHERHOOD ALERT, THE LITTLE CHILDREN’S
ANTI-DRUG CRUSADE, THE THIRD WORLD ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE, THE LITTLE
SHEPHERD DAY CARE CENTER, and the rest of them, only Adela Bacon’s
MILLENNIAL REIGN MUSIC CORPORATION was a conventional business
organization. He regretted that he had never really come to know her.
She had founded the Gates of the Kingdom Church, which was supposedly
Reverend Bacon’s church but which in reality scarcely existed any
longer. She had run it; she had conducted the services; she had uplifted
the church’s Pentecostal flock with her amazing contralto voice and the
cresting waves of her oceans of chords—and she and she alone had been
the church body that had ordained her son Reggie as the Reverend
Reginald Bacon. At first Fiske had been shocked to learn this. Then a
great sociological truth dawned upon him. All religious credentials are
arbitrary, self-proclaimed. Who originated the articles of faith under
which his own boss, the Episcopal Bishop of New York, had been ordained?
Did Moses bring them down in stone from the mountaintop? No, some
Englishman dreamed them up a few centuries ago, and a lot of people with
long white faces agreed to call them rigorous and sacred. The Episcopal
faith was merely older, more ossified, and more respectable than the
Baconian in white society.</p>
<p>But it was long past time to worry about theology and church history.
It was time to retrieve 50,000.</p>
<p>Now he could hear water running and a refrigerator door opening and
one of those hair-trigger coffee machines coming to a boil. That meant
the door to the little service kitchen was open. A tall black man was
peering out. He wore a blue work shirt. He had a long powerful neck and
wore a single large gold earring, like a storybook pirate. That was one
of the things about this place…the way these…these…these…heavies were
always around. They no longer seemed like romantic revolutionaries to
Fiske…They seemed like…The thought of what they might be caused Fiske to
avert his eyes…Now he looked past Bacon, out the bay window behind him.
The window looked out on a backyard. It was early afternoon, but the
yard received only a gloomy greenish light because of the buildings that
had gone up on the streets behind it. Fiske could see the trunks of
three huge old sycamores. That was all that remained of what must have
been quite a little piece of scenery, by New York standards, in its
day.</p>
<p>The muffled chords. In his mind, Fiske could hear the beautiful voice
of Adela Bacon:</p>
<p>“Oh, what…shall I say, Lord?</p>
<p>“And it came…to pass…”</p>
<p>Waves of muffled chords.</p>
<p>“A voice…from on high said…</p>
<p>“ ‘All flesh…is grass…’ ”</p>
<p>A whole ocean of chords.</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon stopped drumming his fingers. He placed the tips of
the fingers of both hands on the edge of the desk. He lifted his chin
slightly and he said:</p>
<p>“This is Harlem.”</p>
<p>He said it slowly and softly. He was as calm as Fiske was nervous.
Fiske had never known the man to raise his voice. Reverend Bacon froze
the look on his face and the position of his hands, in order to let his
words sink in completely.</p>
<p>“This,” he said once more, “is Harlem…see…”</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>“You come up here now, after all this time, and you tell me there are
people with prison records on the board of directors of the Little
Shepherd Day Care Center. You inform me of that fact.”</p>
<p>“I’m not telling you, Reverend Bacon,” said Fiske. “That’s what the
Human Resources Administration is telling us both.”</p>
<p>“I want to tell you something. I want to remind you of something you
told me. Who do we want to run the Little Shepherd Day Care Center? Do
you remember? Do we want your Wellesley girls and your Vassar girls
coming up here to take care of the children of Harlem? Do we want your
social benefactors? Do we want your licensed civil-service bureaucrats?
Your lifers from City Hall? Is that what we want? Is that what we
want?”</p>
<p>Fiske felt compelled to answer. Obediently as a first-grader, he
said, “No.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Reverend Bacon approvingly, “that is not what we want.
What do we want? We want the people of Harlem looking after the children
of Harlem. We’re going to draw our strength…our strength…from our people
and our own streets. I told you that a long time ago, in the earliest
days. Do you remember? Do you remember that?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Fiske, feeling more juvenile by the minute, and more
helpless in the face of that steady gaze.</p>
<p>“Yes. Our own streets. Now, a young man grows up on the streets of
Harlem, the chances are the police have a sheet on that young man. You
understand? They have a sheet on that young man. I’m talking about a
police record. So if you’re saying to everybody who’s ever been in jail
and everybody coming out of jail and everybody on parole, if you’re
saying, ‘You can’t participate in the rebirth of Harlem, because we gave
up on you soon as you got a record’…see…then you are not talking about
the rebirth of Harlem. You’re talking about some make-believe place,
some magic kingdom. You’re fooling yourself. You’re not looking for a
radical solution. You’re wanting to play the same old game, you’re
wanting to see the same old faces. You’re wanting to practice the same
old colonialism. You understand? You understand what I’m saying?”</p>
<p>Fiske was about to nod yes, when all at once Moody spoke up: “Look,
Reverend Bacon, we know all about that, but that’s not the problem.
We’ve got an immediate, specific, technical, legal problem. By law, the
HRA is forbidden to issue a license under these circumstances, and
that’s all there is to that. So let’s take care of that problem, and
let’s see about the 50,000, and then we’ll be in a position to solve the
larger problems.”</p>
<p>Fiske couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Involuntarily he slid
down in his seat and took a wary glance at Reverend Bacon. Reverend
Bacon stared at Moody without any expression at all. He stared at him
long enough for the silence to envelop him. Then, without parting his
lips, he stuck his tongue into his cheek until his cheek popped out the
size of a golf ball. He turned to Fiske and said softly:</p>
<p>“How’d you get up here?”</p>
<p>“Uh…we drove,” said Fiske.</p>
<p>“Where’s your car? What’s it look like?”</p>
<p>Fiske hesitated. Then he told him.</p>
<p>“You should’ve told me sooner,” said Reverend Bacon. “There’s a bad
element around here.” He called out, “Hey, Buck!”</p>
<p>Out of the kitchen came the tall man with the gold earring. The
sleeves of his work shirt were rolled up. He had tremendous elbows.
Reverend Bacon motioned to him, and he came over and bent down and put
his hands on his hips, and Reverend Bacon said something in a low voice.
The man’s arms created terrific angles where they bent at the elbows.
The man stood up and looked very seriously at Reverend Bacon and nodded
and started to leave the room.</p>
<p>“Oh, Buck,” said Reverend Bacon.</p>
<p>Buck stopped and looked around.</p>
<p>“And you keep your eye on that car.”</p>
<p>Buck nodded again and walked out.</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon looked at Fiske. “I hope none of those trifling
boys—anyway, they won’t fool with Buck. Now, what was I saying?” All of
this was to Fiske. It was as if Moody were no longer in the room.</p>
<p>“Reverend Bacon,” said Fiske, “I think—”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon’s intercom buzzed.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>A woman’s voice said: “Irv Stone from Channel 1, on 4–7.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon turned to a telephone on a little cabinet near his
chair. “Hello, Irv…Fine, fine…No, no. Mostly the APS, All People’s
Solidarity. We’ve got a mayor to defeat in November…Not this time, Irv,
not this time. This man, all he needs is a shove. But that’s not what I
called you about. I called you about the Open Gates Employment
Coalition…I said the Open Gates Employment Coalition…How long? A long
time, a long time. Don’t you read the newspapers?…Well, that’s okay.
That’s what I called you about. You know those restaurants downtown,
down in the East Fifties and the East Sixties, those restaurants where
the people, they spend a hundred dollars for lunch, and they spend two
hundred dollars for dinner, and they don’t even think twice about
it?…What? Don’t kid me, Irv. I know about you TV people. You know that
place you have lunch every day. La Boue d’Argent?” Fiske noticed that
Reverend Bacon had no trouble at all pronouncing the name of one of the
most expensive and fashionable restaurants in New York. “Heh, heh, well,
that’s what they told me. Or is it Leicester’s?” He got that one right,
too. Leicester’s was pronounced Lester’s, in the British fashion.
Reverend Bacon was chuckling and smiling now. Evidently he was having
his joke. Fiske was glad to see him smile—over anything. “Well, what I’m
saying is, in any a those places, did you ever see a black waiter? Did
you? Did you ever see a black waiter?…That’s right, you never did. You
never did. In any of them. And why?…That’s right. The unions, too. You
understand what I’m saying?…That’s right. Well, that’s what has to
change…see…has to change. Next Tuesday, starting at noon, the
coalition’s going to demonstrate at Leicester’s restaurant, and when we
get through with that one, we’re going to La Boue d’Argent and the
Macaque and La Grise and the Three Ortolans and all those places…How? By
any means necessary. You’re always talking about footage, Irv. Well, I
can promise you one thing. You’ll have footage. Do you follow me?…Call
Leicester’s? Sure. Go ahead…No, indeed. I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>When he hung up, he said, as if talking to himself, “I hope they do
call ’em up.”</p>
<p>Then he looked at the two young men. “Now!” he said, as if the time
had come to wrap things up and send everyone on his way. “You fellows
see what I got to deal with here. I’ve got the fight of my life. The
fight…of…my…life. The APS, All People’s Solidarity, in November we got
to defeat the most racist mayor in the history of the United States. The
Open Gates Employment Coalition, we got to break down the walls of
apartheid in the job market. And the Third World Anti-Defamation League,
we’re negotiating with a bunch of exploiters making a stone racist movie
called Harlem’s Angels. Gangs and drug dealers and addicts and winos,
that’s all. Racial stereotypes. They think because they got this black
man who leads a young gang to Jesus, they are not racist. But they are
stone racist, and they must be suitably apprised of that reality. So the
day is coming in New York. The hour is drawing nigh. The final battle,
you might say. Gideon’s Army…and you!…you come up here and lay some
chickensh—some trifling thing on me about the board of directors of the
Little Shepherd Day Care Center!”</p>
<p>A fury had crept into the baron’s voice. He had come close to
uttering the word chickenshit, and Fiske had never known him to say so
much as a single foul word, not even a damn, in all the time he had
known him. Fiske was torn between the desire to depart this house before
the final battle began and the hellfire rained down and the desire to
save his job, such as it was. He was the one who had dispatched the
50,000 to Reverend Bacon in the first place. Now he had to retrieve
it.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, testing a middle ground, “you might be right,
Reverend Bacon. And we—the diocese—we are not here to complicate things.
Frankly, we want to protect you, and we want to protect our investment
in you. We gave you 50,000 contingent on the licensing of the day-care
center. So if you’ll turn over the 50,000 or the 40,000, whatever the
exact balance is, and let us put it into an escrow account, then we’ll
help you. We’ll go to bat for you.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon looked at him distractedly, as if pondering a great
decision.</p>
<p>“It is not that simple,” he said.</p>
<p>“Well—why not?”</p>
<p>“That money is mostly…committed.”</p>
<p>“Committed?”</p>
<p>“To the contractors.”</p>
<p>“The contractors? What contractors?”</p>
<p>“What contractors? Good Lord, man, the equipment, the furniture, the
computers, the telephones, the carpet, the air conditioning, the
ventilation—very important with children, the ventilation—the safety
toys. It’s hard to remember all the things.”</p>
<p>“But, Reverend Bacon,” said Fiske, his voice rising, “all you’ve got
so far is an old empty warehouse! I was just by there! There’s nothing
in there! You haven’t hired an architect! You don’t even have any
plans!”</p>
<p>“That’s the least of it. Coordination is the main thing in a project
of this kind. Coordination.”</p>
<p>“Coordination? I don’t see—well, that may be, but if you’ve made
commitments to contractors, then it seems to me you’ve just got to
explain to them that there’s going to be an unavoidable delay.” Fiske
was all at once afraid that he was taking too stern a tone. “If you
don’t mind, how much of the money remains in your hands, Reverend Bacon,
whether committed or not?”</p>
<p>“None of it,” said Reverend Bacon.</p>
<p>“None of it? How can that be?”</p>
<p>“This was seed money. We had to sow the seed. Some of it fell on
fallow ground.”</p>
<p>“Sow the seed? Reverend Bacon, surely you didn’t advance these people
their money before they did the work!”</p>
<p>“These are minority firms. People from the community. That was what
we wanted. Am I not correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But surely you have not advanced—”</p>
<p>“These are not firms with your ‘lines of credit,’ your ‘computerized
inventories,’ your ‘pre-staggered cash flows,’ your ‘convertible asset
management,’ your ‘capital-sensitive liquidity ratios,’ and all that.
These are not firms with factors to go to, like they have in the garment
industry, when bad luck knocks on the door with your ‘unavoidable
delays’…see…These are firms founded by people in the community. These
are the tender shoots that sprout up from the seeds we sow—you, me, the
Episcopal Church, the Gates of the Kingdom Church. Tender shoots…and you
say, ‘unavoidable delay.’ That’s not just a term, that’s not just your
red tape—that’s a sentence of death. A sentence of death. A sentence of
death. That’s saying ‘Kindly drop dead.’ So don’t tell me I can just
explain it to them. Unavoidable delay…Say, unavoidable death.”</p>
<p>“But, Reverend Bacon—we’re talking about 50,000! Surely—”</p>
<p>Fiske looked at Moody. Moody was sitting up straight. He no longer
looked very cool, and he wasn’t saying a word.</p>
<p>“The diocese will—there’ll have to be an audit,” said Fiske. “Right
away.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Reverend Bacon. “There’ll be an audit. I’ll give you
an audit…right away. I’m gonna tell you something. I’m gonna tell you
something about capitalism north of Ninety-sixth Street. Why do you
people think you’re investing all this money, your 50,000, in a day-care
center in Harlem? Why are you?”</p>
<p>Fiske said nothing. Reverend Bacon’s Socratic dialogues made him feel
childish and helpless.</p>
<p>But Bacon insisted. “Now, you go ahead and tell me. I want to hear it
from you. Like you say, we’re going to have an audit. An audit. I want
to hear it from you in your own words. Why are you people investing all
this money in a day-care center in Harlem? Why?”</p>
<p>Fiske couldn’t hold out any longer. “Because day-care centers are
desperately needed in Harlem,” he said, feeling about six years old.</p>
<p>“No, my friend,” said Bacon softly, “that is not why. If you people
were that worried about the children, you would build the day-care
center yourself and hire the best professional people to work in it,
people with experience. You wouldn’t even talk about hiring the people
of the streets. What do the people of the streets know about running a
day-care center? No, my friend, you’re investing in something else.
You’re investing in steam control. And you’re getting value for money.
Value for money.”</p>
<p>“Steam control?”</p>
<p>“Steam control. It’s a capital investment. It’s a very good one. You
know what capital is? You think it’s something you own, don’t you. You
think it’s factories and machines and buildings and land and things you
can sell and stocks and money and banks and corporations. You think it’s
something you own, because you always owned it. You owned all this
land.” He waved his arm back toward the bay window and the gloomy
backyard and the three sycamore trees. “You owned all the land, and out
there, out there in…Kansas…and…Oklahoma…everybody just lined up, and
they said, ‘On the mark, get set, go!’ and a whole lot of white people
started running, and there was all this land, and all they had to do was
get to it and stand on it, and they owned it, and their white skin was
their deed of property…see…The red man, he was in the way, and he was
eliminated. The yellow man, he could lay rails across it, but then he
was shut up in Chinatown. And the black man, he was in chains the whole
time anyway. And so you owned it all, and you still own it, and so you
think capital is owning things. But you are mistaken. Capital is
controlling things. Controlling things. You want land in Kansas? You
want to exercise your white deed of property? First you got to control
Kansas…see…Controlling things. I don’t suppose you ever worked in a
boiler room. I worked in a boiler room. People own the boilers, but that
don’t do ’em a bit of good unless they know how to control the
steam…see…If you can’t control…the steam, then it’s Powder Valley for
you and your whole gang. If you ever see a steam boiler go out of
control, then you see a whole lot of people running for their lives. And
those people, they are not thinking about that boiler as a capital
asset, they are not thinking about the return on their investment, they
are not thinking about the escrow accounts and the audits and the
prudent thing…see…They are saying, ‘Great God almighty, I lost control,’
and they are running for their lives. They’re trying to save their very
hides. You see this house?” He gestured vaguely toward the ceiling.
“This house was built in the year nineteen hundred and six by a man
named Stanley Lightfoot Bowman. Lightfoot. Turkish towels and damask
tablecloths, wholesale, Stanley Lightfoot Bowman. He sold those Turkish
towels and damask tablecloths in job lots. He spent almost a half a
million dollars on this house in nineteen hundred and six…see…The man’s
initials, S.L.B., they’re down there made of bronze, going all the way
up the stairs, instead a spindles. This was the place to be in nineteen
hundred and six. They built these big houses all the way up the West
Side, starting at Seventy-second Street, all the way up here. Yeah, and
I bought this house from a—from a Jewish fellow—in nineteen hundred and
seventy-eight for sixty-two thousand dollars, and that fellow was happy
to get that money. He was licking his chops and saying, ‘I got some—some
fool to give me sixty-two thousand dollars for that place.’ Well, what
happened to all those Stanley Lightfoot Bow-mans? Did they lose their
money? No, they lost control…see…They lost control north of Ninety-sixth
Street, and when they lost control, they lost the capital. You
understand? All that capital, it vanished off the face of the earth. The
house was still there, but the capital, it vanished see…So what I’m
telling you is, you best be waking up. You’re practicing the capitalism
of the future, and you don’t even know it. You’re not investing in a
day-care center for the children of Harlem. You’re investing in the
souls…the souls…of the people who’ve been in Harlem too long to look at
it like children any longer, people who’ve grown up with a righteous
anger in their hearts and a righteous steam building up in their souls,
ready to blow. A righteous steam. When you people come up here and talk
about ‘minority contractors’ and ‘minority hiring’ and day-care centers
for the street people, of the street people, and by the street people,
you’re humming the right tune, but you don’t want to sing the right
words. You don’t want to come right out and say it: ‘Please, dear Lord,
God almighty, let’m do what they want with the money, just so long’s it
controls the steam…before it’s too late…Well, you go ahead and have your
audit and talk to your HRA and reorganize your boards and cross all the
t’s and dot all the i’s. Meantime, I’ve done your investing for you, and
thanks to me, you’re already ahead of the game…Oh, conduct your
audit!…But the time is coming when you will say: ‘Thank God. Thank God!
Thank God we entered the money on the books Reverend Bacon’s way!’
Because I’m the conservative, whether you know it or not. You don’t know
who’s out there on those wild and hungry streets. I am your prudent
broker on Judgment Day. Harlem, the Bronx, and Brooklyn, they’re gonna
blow, my friend, and on that day, how grateful you will be for your
prudent broker…your prudent broker…who can control the steam. Oh yes. On
that day, the owners of capital, how happy they will be to exchange what
they own, how happy they will be to give up their very birthrights, just
to control that wild and hungry steam. No, you go on back down, and you
say, ’Bishop, I’ve been uptown, and I’m here to tell you we made a good
investment. We found a prudent broker. We’re gonna occupy the high
ground when it all comes down.”</p>
<p>Just then the intercom buzzer sounded again, and the secretary’s
voice said: “There’s a Mr. Simpson on the phone, from the Citizens
Mutual Insurance Company. He wants to talk to the president of Urban
Guaranty Investments.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon picked up the telephone. “This is Reginald
Bacon…That’s right, president and chief executive officer…That’s right,
that’s right…Yes, well, I appreciate your interest, Mr. Simpson, but we
already brought that issue to market…That’s right, the entire issue…Oh,
absolutely, Mr. Simpson, those school bonds are very popular. Of course,
it helps to know that particular market, and that’s what Urban Guaranty
Investments is here for. We want to put Harlem in the market…That’s
right, that’s right, Harlem’s always been on the market…see…Now Harlem’s
gonna be in the market…Thank you, thank you…Well, why don’t you try one
of our associates downtown. Are you familiar with the firm of Pierce
andandandand Pierce?…That’s right…They brought a very large block of
that issue to market, a very large block. I’m sure they’ll be happy to
do business with you.”</p>
<p>Urban Guaranty Investments? Pierce andandandand Pierce? Pierce
andandandand Pierce was one of the biggest and hottest investment
banking houses on Wall Street. A terrible suspicion invaded Fiske’s
ordinarily charitable heart. He cut a glance at Moody, and Moody was
looking at him, and, it was obvious, wondering the same thing. Had Bacon
shifted 50,000 into this securities operation, whatever in the name of
God it actually was? If the money had entered the securities market,
then by now it could have vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>As soon as Reverend Bacon hung up, Fiske said: “I didn’t know you
had—I’d never heard of—well, perhaps you—but I don’t think so—what is—I
couldn’t help but hear you mention—what is Urban Guaranty
Investments?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Reverend Bacon, “we do a little underwriting, whenever we
can help out. No reason why Harlem should always buy retail and sell
wholesale…see…Why not make Harlem the broker?”</p>
<p>To Fiske this was pure gibberish. “But where do you get—how are you
able to finance—I mean something like that—” He could think of no way to
put this particular lit firecracker into words. The necessary euphemisms
eluded him. To his surprise, Moody spoke up again.</p>
<p>“I know a little about securities firms, Reverend Bacon, and I know
they require a lot of capital.” He paused, and Fiske could tell that
Moody was thrashing about in the swollen seas of circumlocution, too.
“Well, what I mean is, ordinary capital, capital in the ordinary sense.
You’ve—we’ve just been talking about capital north of Ninety-sixth
Street and controlling…uh, the steam, as you mentioned…but this sounds
like straight capitalism, basic capitalism, if you see what I mean.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon looked at him balefully, then chuckled in his throat
and smiled, not with kindness.</p>
<p>“It don’t require capital. We’re underwriters. We bring the issues to
market, so long as they’re for the good of the community…see…schools,
hospitals—”</p>
<p>“Yes, but—”</p>
<p>“As Paul knew, there are many roads to Damascus, my friend. Many
roads.” Many roads hung in the air, humid with meaning.</p>
<p>“Yes, I know, but—”</p>
<p>“If I were you,” said Reverend Bacon, “I wouldn’t worry about Urban
Guaranty Investments. If I were you, I’d do like the old folks say. I’d
stick to my knitting.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m trying to do, Reverend Bacon,” said Moody. “My
knitting is—well, it amounts to three hundred and fifty thousand
dollars.”</p>
<p>Fiske slumped down in his seat again. Moody had regained his fool’s
courage. Fiske cut a glance at the fool killer behind the desk. Just
then the intercom buzzed again.</p>
<p>The secretary’s voice said: “I got Annie Lamb on the line. Says she’s
got to talk to you.”</p>
<p>“Annie Lamb?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Reverend.”</p>
<p>A big sigh. “All right, I’ll take it.” He picked up the telephone.
“Annie?…Annie, wait a minute. Slow down…Say what? Henry?…That’s
terrible, Annie. How bad is it?…Aw, Annie, I’m sorry…He did?” A long
pause, as Reverend Bacon listened, eyes cast down. “What do the police
say?…Parking tickets? That don’t—…That don’t—…I say, that don’t—…Okay,
Annie, look here. You come on over here and you tell me the whole
thing…Meantime, I’m calling the hospital. They didn’t do the right
thing, Annie. That’s what it sounds like to me. They did not do the
right thing…What?…You are absolutely right. You’re right as rainwater.
They did not do the right thing, and they’re going to hear from me…Don’t
worry. You come right on over here.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon hung up the telephone and swiveled back toward Fiske
and Moody and narrowed his eyes and looked at them gravely. “Gentlemen,
I’ve got an emergency here. One of my most loyal workers, one of my
community leaders, her son’s been struck down by a hit-and-run driver…in
a Mercedes-Benz. A Mercedes-Benz…He’s at death’s door, and this good
woman is afraid to go to the police, and do you know why? Parking
tickets. They’ve got a warrant out for her arrest for parking tickets.
This lady works. She works downtown at City Hall, and she needs that
car, and they’ve got a warrant out for…parking tickets. That wouldn’t
stop you if it was your son, but you’ve never lived in the ghetto. If it
was your son, they wouldn’t do what they did. They wouldn’t wrap up his
wrist and send him packing when what he’s got is a concussion and he’s
at death’s door…see…But that’s the story of the ghetto. Gross
negligence. That’s what the ghetto is…gross negligence…Gentlemen, our
conference is adjourned. I’ve got some serious business to tend to
now.”</p>
<p>On the drive back downtown the two young Yale men didn’t say much
until they were almost at Ninety-sixth Street. Fiske was happy enough to
have found the car where he had left it, with the tires still inflated
and the windshield in one piece. As for Moody—twenty blocks had gone by
and Fiske hadn’t heard a peep out of Moody about being a linebacker at
Yale.</p>
<p>Finally, Moody said, “Well, you want to have dinner at Leicester’s? I
know the mattre d’, a big tall black fellow with a gold earring.”</p>
<p>Fiske smiled faintly but said nothing. Moody’s little joke made Fiske
feel superior. Part of the presumed humor was the implausibility of the
notion that either of them would be dining at Leicester’s, which was
this year’s most fashionable restaurant of the century. Well, it just so
happened that Fiske was going to Leicester’s this very evening. Moody
also didn’t realize that Leicester’s, although fashionable, was not a
formal restaurant featuring a starched regiment of maître d’s and
captains. It was more the British bistro-out-Fulham-Road sort of thing.
Leicester’s was the favorite hangout of the British colony in New York,
and Fiske had gotten to know quite a few of them—and, well, it was the
kind of thing he could never explain to a fellow like Moody, but the
British understood the art of conversation. Fiske considered himself
essentially British, British in ancestry and British in…well, in a
certain innately aristocratic comprehension of how one conducted one’s
life, aristocratic in the sense not of the richest but of the best. He
was like the great Lord Philbank, wasn’t he?—Philbank, a pillar of the
Church of England who had used his social connections and his knowledge
of the financial markets to help the poor of London’s East End.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it,” said Moody, “I never have seen a black waiter
in a restaurant in New York, except for lunch counters. You really think
Bacon is going to get anywhere?”</p>
<p>“Depends on what you mean by that.”</p>
<p>“Well, what will happen?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Fiske, “but they want to be waiters at
Leicester’s about as much as you and I do. I kind of think they just
might settle for a contribution to the Reverend Mr. Bacon’s good works
in Harlem, and then they’ll move on to the next restaurant.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s just a payoff,” said Moody.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s the funny thing,” said Fiske. “Things do change. I’m
not sure he cares whether they change or not, but they change. Places he
never heard of, and wouldn’t care about if he had, they’ll start hiring
black waiters rather than wait for Buck and all those characters to turn
up.”</p>
<p>“The steam,” said Moody.</p>
<p>“I suppose,” said Fiske. “Didn’t you just love all that about the
boiler room? He’s never worked in any boiler room. But he’s discovered a
new resource, I guess you could call it. Maybe it’s even a form of
capital, if you define capital as anything you can use to create more
wealth. I don’t know, maybe Bacon is no different from Rockefeller or
Carnegie. You discover a new resource and you take your money while
you’re young, and when you’re old they give you awards and name things
after you, and you’re remembered as a leader of the people.”</p>
<p>“All right, then what about Urban Guaranty Investments? That doesn’t
sound like any new resource.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be too sure. I don’t know what it is, but I’m going to
find out. I’m willing to bet you one thing. Whatever it is, it’s going
to have some kind of weird angle, and it’s going to drive me a little
bit farther around the fucking bend.”</p>
<p>Then Fiske bit his lip, because he was in truth a devout Episcopalian
and seldom swore and regarded foul language not only as wrong but as
common. This was one of quite a few points on which, even at this late
date, he happened to agree with Reginald Bacon.</p>
<p>By the time they reached Seventy-ninth Street, securely in White
Manhattan, Fiske knew that Bacon was right once more. They weren’t
investing in a day-care center, were they…They were trying to buy souls.
They were trying to tranquilize the righteously angry soul of
Harlem.</p>
<p>Let’s face facts!</p>
<p>Then he snapped out of it. Fiske…you idiot…If he didn’t manage to
retrieve the 50,000, or most of it, he was going to look like a most
righteous fool.</p>
