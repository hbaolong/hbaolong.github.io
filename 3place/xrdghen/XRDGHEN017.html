<h4 id="the-favor-bank">17. The Favor Bank</h4>
<p>Over the intercom came the secretary’s voice: “I got Irv Stone on the
line, from Channel 1.” Without a word to Bernie Fitzgibbon, Milt Lubell,
or Kramer, Abe Weiss stopped in the middle of a sentence and picked up
the telephone. Without a hello or any other preliminary remark, he said
into the mouthpiece: “Whadda I gotta do with you guys?” It was the voice
of a tired and disappointed parent. “You’re supposed to be a news
organization in the most important city in the country. Right? And
what’s the most serious problem in the most important city in the
country? Drugs. And what’s the worst of the drugs? Crack. Am I right?
And we bring in grand-jury indictments against three of the biggest
crack dealers in the Bronx, and whadda you guys do? Nothing…Lemme
finish. We bring all three a them into Central Booking at ten o’clock in
the morning, and where are you guys? Nowhere…Wait a minute, my ass!” No
longer the saddened parent. Now the irate neighbor on the floor below.
“You got no excuse, Irv! You guys are lazy. You’re afraid you’re gonna
miss a meal at the Côte Basque. One day you’re gonna wake up—what?…Don’t
gimme that, Irv! The only thing wrong with those crack dealers is,
they’re black and they’re from the Bronx! Whaddaya want, Vanderbilt,
Astor, and—and—and—and—and Wriston?” He didn’t seem too sure about
Wriston. “One day you’re gonna wake up and realize you’re out of it.
This is America up here in the Bronx, Irv, modern-day America! And
there’s black people in modern-day America, whether you know it or not!
Manhattan’s an offshore boutique! This is America! This is the
laboratory of human relations! This is the experiment in urban
living!…Whaddaya mean, how about the Lamb case? What’s’at gotta do with
this? Big deal, you covered a story in the Bronx. Whaddaya got, a
quota!”</p>
<p>He hung up. No goodbye. He turned to Fitzgibbon, who sat to one side
of the district attorney’s enormous desk. Kramer and Lubell sat on
either side of Fitzgibbon. Weiss put his hands up in the air, as if he
were holding a medicine ball over his head.</p>
<p>“They’re screaming about crack every night, and we bring in
indictments against three major dealers, and he’s telling me there’s no
story in it, it’s routine stuff.”</p>
<p>Kramer found himself shaking his head, to indicate how saddened he
was by the obstinacy of television newsmen. Weiss’s press secretary,
Milt Lubell, a skinny little man with a grizzly gray beard and big eyes,
swiveled his head in a state of advanced disbelief. Only Bernie
Fitzgibbon took this news without the slightest locomotor reaction.</p>
<p>“You see?” said Weiss. He jerked his thumb toward the telephone
without looking at it. “I try to talk to this guy about drug
indictments, and he throws the Lamb case in my face.”</p>
<p>The district attorney looked extremely angry. But then, every time
Kramer had laid eyes on him he had looked angry. Weiss was about
forty-eight. He had a full head of light brown hair, a narrow face, and
a strong, lean jaw with a scar on one side. There was nothing wrong with
that. Abe Weiss was one of a long line of New York district attorneys
whose careers had been based on appearing on television and announcing
the latest paralyzing wallop to the solar plexus of crime in the
seething metropolis. Weiss, the good Captain Ahab, might be the object
of jokes. But he was wired in to the Power, and the Power flowed through
him, and his office, with its paneled walls and outsized old wooden
furniture and its American flag on a stand, was a command post of the
Power, and Kramer tingled with the excitement of being called in on a
summit meeting like this.</p>
<p>“Some way,” said Weiss, “we gotta get out in fronta this case. Right
now I’m stuck in a position where all I can do is react. You musta seen
this coming, Bernie, and you didn’t warn me. Kramer here talked to Bacon
a week ago, it musta been.”</p>
<p>“That’s just the point, Abe,” said Fitzgibbon. “That’s—”</p>
<p>Weiss pushed a button on his desk, and Fitzgibbon stopped talking,
because obviously the district attorney’s mind had departed the
immediate vicinity. He was looking at a television screen on the other
side of the room. Bulging from the stately paneled wall, like a
high-tech goiter, was a bank of four television sets and stacks of
steely boxes with steely knobs and black glass dials and green-diode
lights in a nest of electrical cords. Rows of videocassettes stretched
across the shelves behind the television sets, where books had once
been. If Abe Weiss or anything concerning Abe Weiss or anything
concerning crime and punishment in the Bronx was on television, Abe
Weiss wanted it on tape. One of the sets flared to life. Just the
picture; no sound. A cloth banner filled the screen…JOHANNE X BRONX:
WEISS JUSTICE IS APARTHEID JUSTICE…Then came a cluster of angry faces,
white and black, shot from below so that they looked like an
overwhelming mob.</p>
<p>“F’r Chrissake, who the hell’s that?” asked Weiss.</p>
<p>“That’s Channel 7,” said Milt Lubell.</p>
<p>Kramer looked at Lubell. “But they weren’t even there, Channel 7.
There was only Channel 1.” He said it in a low voice, to indicate he was
daring to talk only to the district attorney’s press secretary. He
wasn’t presuming to jump into the general conversation.</p>
<p>“You didn’t see this?” said Lubell. “This was last night. After I ran
it, the rest of them got hot for the story. So they had another
demonstration last night.”</p>
<p>“You’re kidding!” said Kramer.</p>
<p>“Ran on five or six channels. Smart move.”</p>
<p>Weiss pushed another button on his desk, and a second screen came on.
On the first screen heads continued to flare up and vanish, flare up and
vanish. On the second, three male musicians with bony faces and huge
Adam’s apples and one woman…in a dark and smoky back alley…MTV…A
whirring sound…The musicians split up into vibrating stripes. The
videocassette kicks in. A moon-faced young man with a microphone under
his chin…out in front of the Poe projects…The usual pack of teenagers
are cutting up in the background.</p>
<p>“Mort Selden, Channel 5,” said Weiss.</p>
<p>“Right,” said Milt Lubell.</p>
<p>Weiss hit another button. A third screen lit up. The musicians were
back on the smoky street. The woman had dark lips…like Shelly
Thomas’s…the most exquisite yearning came over Kramer…The musicians
turned into jittery stripes again. A man with Latin features…</p>
<p>“Roberto Olvidado,” said Lubell.</p>
<p>The man held a microphone in the face of an angry black woman. In no
time there were three sets of heads flaring and vanishing, flaring and
vanishing, casting their toxic-wave glow upon the carved wood.</p>
<p>Weiss said to Fitzgibbon: “You realize that’s all that was on the
news last night, the Lamb case? And all Milt’s done all morning is take
calls from reporters and these goddamned people wanting to know what
we’re doing.”</p>
<p>“But that’s ridiculous, Abe,” said Fitzgibbon. “What are we supposed
to do? We’re prosecutors, and the cops haven’t even made an arrest
yet.”</p>
<p>“Bacon’s cute,” said Lubell. “He’s cute. Oh, he’s a cutie. He says
the cops have talked to the kid’s mother and we’ve talked to the kid’s
mother, and for some bullshit reason we’re conspiring to do nothing. We
don’t care about black people in the projects.”</p>
<p>All at once Weiss turned a baleful eye upon Kramer, and Kramer
braced.</p>
<p>“Kramer, I want you to tell me something. Did you really tell the
kid’s mother that her information was useless?”</p>
<p>“No, sir, I certainly did not!” Kramer realized that his answer
sounded a bit too frantic. “The only thing I said was, I said that what
her son said to her was hearsay, in terms of a prosecution, and what we
really needed was witnesses, and she should let us know immediately if
she heard of anyone who saw what happened. That’s all I said. I didn’t
say what she told me was useless at all. Just the opposite. I thanked
her for it. I don’t know how anybody could twist it around like
that.”</p>
<p>And all the while he was thinking: Why did I have to play it so cool
with the woman? To impress Martin and Goldberg, so they wouldn’t think I
was being soft! So they would regard me as properly Irish! Why couldn’t
I have been a good sympathetic Jew? Now look at the fix I’m in…He
wondered if Weiss would throw him off the case.</p>
<p>But Weiss just nodded ruefully and said, “Yeah, I know…But just
remember, you can’t always be logical with…” He decided not to finish
the sentence. He shifted his gaze to Fitzgibbon. “Bacon can say any
goddamned thing he wants to, and I have to sit here and say, ‘My hands
are tied.’”</p>
<p>“I hope you realize, Abe, these demonstrations are pure bullshit. A
dozen of Bacon’s boys and another coupla dozen of the usual fruitcakes,
the Monolithic Socialist Labor Party, whatever. Right, Larry?”</p>
<p>“The night I was there, yeah,” said Kramer. But something told him
not to play down the importance of the demonstrations. So he motioned
toward the television screens and said, “But I tell you, it looks like
there was a much bigger crowd last night.”</p>
<p>“Well, sure,” said Lubell. “It’s the old self-fulfilling prophecy.
Once it’s on TV and all over the newspapers, people figure it’s
important. They figure they got to get excited about it. The old
self-fulfilling prophecy.”</p>
<p>“Anyway,” said Weiss, “what’s the situation? What about this guy
McCoy? Whadda we got on him? These two cops—what are their names?”</p>
<p>“Martin and Goldberg,” said Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>“They say this is the guy, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“They’re good men?”</p>
<p>“Martin’s got a lot of experience,” said Fitzgibbon. “But he’s not
infallible. Just because this guy got so worked up, that don’t
necessarily mean he did anything.”</p>
<p>“Park Avenue,” said Weiss. “His old man ran Dunning Sponget
andandandand Leach. Milt found his name in a couple of social columns,
and his wife’s an interior decorator.” Weiss sank back in his chair and
smiled, the way one smiles over impossible dreams. “That sure would put
an end to this shit about white justice.”</p>
<p>“Abe,” said the Irish cold shower, Fitzgibbon, “we got zip on the guy
so far.”</p>
<p>“Is there any way we can bring him in for questioning? We know he was
driving his car the night the thing happened.”</p>
<p>“He’s got a lawyer now, Abe. Tommy Killian, in fact.”</p>
<p>“Tommy? I wonder how the hell he found Tommy. How do you know
that?”</p>
<p>“Tommy called me up. Said he represented the guy. Wanted to know why
the cops were asking him questions.”</p>
<p>“What did you tell him?”</p>
<p>“I said the guy’s car matches the description of the car they’re
looking for. So they’re trying to check it out.”</p>
<p>“What did he say to that?”</p>
<p>“He said they got a bullshit description based on hearsay.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>“I said we also got a kid in the hospital likely to die, and the cops
are investigating with the information they have.”</p>
<p>“What’s the kid’s situation? Any change in his condition?”</p>
<p>“Naw…He’s still in a coma, in the intensive-care unit. He’s living on
tubes.”</p>
<p>“Any chance he’ll regain consciousness?”</p>
<p>“From what they told me, it can happen, but it don’t mean anything.
They can drift in, but they drift right back out. Besides, he can’t
talk. He’s breathing from a tube down his throat.”</p>
<p>“But maybe he can point,” said Weiss.</p>
<p>“Point?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I got an idea.” A far-off look; the distant gaze of
inspiration. “We take a picture of McCoy over to the hospital. Milt
found one in one a these magazines.”</p>
<p>Weiss handed Bernie Fitzgibbon a page out of some kind of social
weekly called W. The page was mostly pictures of grinning people. The
men had on tuxedos. The women were all teeth and gaunt faces. Kramer
leaned over to have a look. One picture had been circled by a red
marker. A man and a woman, both grinning, in evening dress. Look at
them. The Wasps. The man had a narrow pointed nose. His head was thrown
back, which brought out his big patrician chin. Such a
confident…arrogant?…smile…The woman looked Wasp, too, but in a different
way. She had that tight, neat, proper, composed look that immediately
makes you wonder what’s wrong with what you’re wearing or what you just
said. The caption said Sherman and Judy McCoy. They were at some sort of
charity event. Here on floor 6M of the island fortress, when you heard a
name like Sherman McCoy, you naturally assumed the person was black. But
these were the originals, the Wasps. Kramer hardly ever saw them except
in this form, in pictures, and the pictures showed him bland,
stiff-necked aliens with pointed noses whom God, in His perversity, had
favored with so much. This was no longer a conscious thought, in words,
however; by now it was a reflex.</p>
<p>Weiss was saying, “We take this picture of McCoy and three or four
other people, three or four other white guys, over there and we put ’em
by his bed. He comes to, and he points to McCoy’s picture…He keeps
pointing…”</p>
<p>Bernie Fitzgibbon looked at Weiss as if he were waiting for a clue, a
tip, that this was only a little joke.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s worth a try,” said Weiss.</p>
<p>“Who’s gonna witness all this?” said Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>“A nurse, a doctor, whoever’s there. Then we go over and take a
proper dying declaration.”</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon said, “Proper? How? I don’t believe what I’m hearing, Abe.
Some poor gork with a tube down his throat pointing at a picture? That
would never stand up.”</p>
<p>“I know that, Bernie. I just wanna bring the guy in. Then we can
relax and do the thing right.”</p>
<p>“Abe!…Jesus Christ! Never mind the legal side of it for a minute.
You’re gonna put a picture of a Wall Street investment banker and a
buncha other white guys on the kid’s bedside table while he’s fucking
dying? Suppose he comes to—and he looks at the fucking table—and here’s
half a dozen middle-aged white men in suits and ties staring at him! The
fucking kid’s gonna stroke out for sure! He’s gonna say, ‘Holy shit!’
and give up the fucking ghost! I mean, have a fucking heart, Abe!”</p>
<p>Weiss let out a great sigh and seemed to deflate before Kramer’s
eyes. “Yeah. You’re right. It’s too wild.”</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon cut a glance at Kramer.</p>
<p>Kramer didn’t bat an eye. He didn’t want to cast so much as a twitch
of aspersion upon the wisdom of the District Attorney of Bronx County.
Captain Ahab was obsessed with the Lamb case, and he, Kramer, still had
the case in his hands. He still had a shot at that much-prized,
ever-elusive, and, in the Bronx, very nearly mythical creature, the
Great White Defendant.</p>
<p>On Fridays the Taliaferro School discharged its students at 12:30
P.M. This was solely because so many of the girls came from families
with weekend places in the country who wanted to get out of the city by
2:00 P.M., before the Friday-afternoon rush hour. So, as usual, Judy was
going to drive out to Long Island with Campbell, Bonita, and Miss Lyons,
the nanny, in the Mercury station wagon. As usual, Sherman would drive
out in the Mercedes roadster that evening or the next morning, depending
on how late he had to stay at Pierce andandandand Pierce. Very
convenient this arrangement had proved to be over the past few months. A
leisurely visit with Maria in her little hideaway had become a regular
Friday-night custom.</p>
<p>All morning, from his desk at Pierce andandandand Pierce, he tried to
reach Maria by telephone, at her apartment on Fifth Avenue and at the
hideaway. No one answered at the hideaway. At the apartment a maid
professed to know nothing of her whereabouts, not even what state or
nation she was in. Finally he became desperate enough to leave his name
and telephone number. She didn’t call back.</p>
<p>She was avoiding him! At the Bavardages’ she had told him to call her
last night. He had called repeatedly; no answer at all. She was cutting
off all contact! But for precisely what reason? Fear? She wasn’t the
fearful type…The crucial fact that would save him: she was driving…But
if she vanished! That was crazy. She couldn’t vanish. Italy! She could
vanish in Italy! Awww…that was preposterous. He held his breath and
opened his mouth. He could actually hear his heart beating…tch, tch,
tch, tch…under his sternum. His eyes slid right off the computer
terminals. Couldn’t just sit here; he had to do something. The hell of
it was, there was only one person he could turn to for advice, and that
was someone he scarcely even knew, Killian.</p>
<p>About noon he called Killian. The receptionist said he was in court.
Twenty minutes later Killian called from a noisy pay telephone and said
he would meet him at one o’clock in the main lobby of the Criminal
Courts Building at 100 Centre Street.</p>
<p>On the way out, Sherman told Muriel a mere half lie. He said he was
going to see a lawyer named Thomas Killian, and he gave her Killian’s
telephone number. The half lie was in the offhand way he said it, which
implied that Thomas Killian, Esq., was involved in Pierce andandandand
Pierce business.</p>
<p>On this balmy day in June, 100 Centre Street was an easy walk uptown
from Wall Street. In all the years he had lived in New York and worked
downtown, Sherman had never noticed the Criminal Courts Building, even
though it was one of the biggest and grandest buildings in the City Hall
area. An architect named Harvey Wiley Corbett had designed it in the
Moderne style, which was now called Art Deco. Corbett, once so famous,
had been forgotten except by a handful of architectural historians;
likewise, the excitement over the Criminal Courts Building when it was
completed in 1933. The patterns of stone and brass and glass at the
entrance were still impressive, but when Sherman reached the great lobby
within, something put him on red alert. He could not have told you what.
In fact, it was the dark faces, the sneakers and the warm-up jackets and
the Pimp Rolls. To him it was like the Port Authority bus terminal. It
was an alien terrain. Throughout the vast space, which had the soaring
ceilings of an old-fashioned railroad station, were huddles of dark
people, and their voices created a great nervous rumble, and around the
edges of the dark people walked white men in cheap suits or sport
jackets, watching them like wolves monitoring the sheep. More dark
people, young men, walked through the lobby in twos and threes with a
disconcerting pumping gait. Off to one side, in the gloom, a half dozen
figures, black and white, leaned into a row of public telephones. On the
other side, elevators swallowed up and disgorged more dark people, and
the huddles of dark people broke up, and others formed, and the nervous
rumble rose and fell and rose and fell, and the sneakers squeaked on the
marble floors.</p>
<p>It wasn’t hard to pick out Killian. He was near the elevators in
another of his sharpie outfits, a pale gray suit with wide chalk stripes
and a shirt with a white spread collar and maroon pinstripes. He was
talking to a small middle-aged white man in a warm-up jacket. As Sherman
walked up, he heard Killian say, “A discount for cash? Gedoudahere,
Dennis. Whaddaya whaddaya?” The little man said something. “It’s not a
big thing, Dennis. Cash is all I get. Haifa my clients ain’t been
introduced to checking accounts, as it is. Besides, I pay my fucking
taxes. That’s one less thing to worry about.” He saw Sherman walking up,
nodded, then said to the little man: “What can I tell you? It’s like I
said. Get it to me by Monday. Otherwise I can’t get started.” The little
man followed Killian’s eyes toward Sherman, said something in a low
voice, then walked off, shaking his head.</p>
<p>Killian said to Sherman, “How you doing?”</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>“You ever been here before?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“The biggest law office in New York. You see those two guys over
there?” He motioned toward two white men in suits and ties roaming among
the huddles of dark people. “They’re lawyers. They’re looking for
clients to represent.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“It’s simple. They just walk up and say, ‘Hey, you need a
lawyer?’”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that ambulance chasing?”</p>
<p>“That it is. See that guy over there?” He pointed to a short man in a
loud, checked sport jacket standing in front of a bank of elevators.
“His name is Miguel Escalero. They call him Mickey Elevator. He’s a
lawyer. He stands there half the morning, and every time somebody who
looks Hispanic and miserable walks up, he says, ‘¿Necesita usted un
abogado?’ If the guys says, ‘I can’t afford a lawyer,’ he says, ‘How
much you got in your pocket?’ If the guy has fifty dollars, he’s got
himself a lawyer.”</p>
<p>Sherman said, “What do you get for fifty dollars?”</p>
<p>“He’ll walk the guy through a plea or an arraignment. If it actually
involves working for the client, he don’t want to know about it. A
specialist. So how you doing?”</p>
<p>Sherman told him of his vain attempts to reach Maria.</p>
<p>“Sounds to me like she’s got herself a lawyer,” said Killian. As he
spoke, he rolled his head around with his eyes half closed, like a boxer
loosening up for a fight. Sherman found this rude but said nothing.</p>
<p>“And the lawyer’s telling her not to talk to me.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’d tell her if she was my client. Don’t mind me. I did
a buncha wrestler’s bridges yesterday. I think I did something to my
neck.”</p>
<p>Sherman stared at him.</p>
<p>“I used to like to run,” said Killian, “but all that pounding up and
down screwed up my back. So now I go to the New York Athletic Club and
lift weights. I see all these kids doing wrestler’s bridges. I guess I’m
too old for wrestler’s bridges. I’m gonna try to get hold of her
myself.” He stopped rolling his head.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I’ll think a something. Half a my practice consists of talking to
people who are not anxious to talk.” Tawk.</p>
<p>“To tell you the truth,” said Sherman, “this really surprises me.
Maria—Maria’s not the cautious type. She’s an adventuress. She’s a
gambler. This little Southern girl, from nowhere, who makes it to 962
Fifth Avenue…I don’t know…And this may sound naïve, but I think she
genuinely…feels something for me. I think she loves me.”</p>
<p>“I bet she loves 962 Fifth, too,” said Killian. “Maybe she figures
it’s time to stop gambling.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” said Sherman, “but I just can’t believe she would
disappear on me. Of course, it’s only been two days.”</p>
<p>“If it comes to that,” said Killian, “we have an investigator works
right out of our office. Used to be a detective in Major Cases with the
Police Department. But there’s no point in running up expenses unless we
really need to. And I don’t think we gonna need to. Right now they got
nothing. I talked to Bernie Fitzgibbon. You remember the fellow I was
talking to you about, in the Homicide Bureau of the Bronx D.A.’s
Office?”</p>
<p>“You’ve already talked to him?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. The press has put pressure on them, so they’re checking out
cars. That’s all ’at’s happening. They got nothing.”</p>
<p>“How can you be sure?”</p>
<p>“Whaddaya mean?”</p>
<p>“How can you be sure he’ll tell you the truth?”</p>
<p>“Oh, he might not tell me everything he knows, but he’s not gonna lie
to me. He’s not gonna mislead me.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>Killian looked out over the lobby of 100 Centre Street. Then he
turned back to Sherman. “You ever hear of the Favor Bank?”</p>
<p>“The Favor Bank? No.”</p>
<p>“Well, everything in this building, everything in the criminal
justice system in New York”—New Yawk—“operates on favors. Everybody does
favors for everybody else. Every chance they get, they make deposits in
the Favor Bank. One time when I was just starting out as an assistant
D.A., I was trying a case, and I was up against this lawyer, an older
guy, and he was just tying me up in knots. The guy was Jewish. I didn’t
know how to handle him. So I talked it over with my supervisor, who was
a Harp, like me. The next thing I know, he’s taking me in to see the
judge, in his chambers. The judge was a Harp, too, an old guy with white
hair. I’ll never forget it. We walk in, and he’s standing beside his
desk playing with one of these indoor putting sets. You hit the golf
ball along the carpet, and instead of a hole there’s this cup with a rim
on it that slopes down. He don’t”—don’t—“even look up. He’s lining up
this putt. My bureau chief leaves the room, and I’m standing there, and
the judge says, ‘Tommy…’ He’s still looking at the golf ball. Tommy, he
calls me, and I never laid eyes on him except in the courtroom. ‘Tommy,’
he says, ‘you seem like a good lad. I understand there’s a certain Jew
bastard been giving you a very hard time.’ I’m fucking astounded. This
is so irregular—you know, fuhgedaboudit. I can’t even think a what to
say. Then he says, ‘I wouldn’t worry about it anymore, Tommy.’ He still
don’t look up. So I just said, ‘Thank you, Judge,’ and left the room.
After that, it’s the judge who’s tying up this lawyer in knots. When I
say ‘Objection,’ I can’t get to the second syllable before he says
‘Sustained.’ All of a sudden I look like a genius. Now this was a pure
deposit in the Favor Bank. There was absolutely nothing I could do for
that judge—not then. A deposit in the Favor Bank is not quid pro quo.
It’s saving up for a rainy day. In criminal law there’s a lotta gray
areas, and you gotta operate in ’em, but if you make a mistake, you can
be in a whole lotta trouble, and you’re gonna need a whole lotta help in
a hurry, I mean, look at these guys.” He gestured toward the lawyers
prowling among the people in the lobby and then toward Mickey Elevator.
“They could be arrested. Without the Favor Bank, they’d be finished. But
if you’ve been making your regular deposits in the Favor Bank, then
you’re in a position to make contracts. That’s what they call big
favors, contracts. You have to make good on contracts.”</p>
<p>“You have to? Why?”</p>
<p>“Because everybody in the courthouse believes in a saying: ‘What goes
around comes around.’ That means if you don’t take care a me today, I
won’t take care a you tomorrow. When you got basically no confidence in
your own abilities, that’s a frightening idea.”</p>
<p>“So you asked your friend Fitzgibbon for a contract? Is that the
expression?”</p>
<p>“No, what I got from him was just an everyday favor, just your
standard protocol. There’s nothing to waste a contract on yet. My
strategy is, things shouldn’t reach that point. Right now, it seems to
me, the loose cannon is your friend Mrs. Ruskin.”</p>
<p>“I still think she’ll get in touch with me.”</p>
<p>“If she does, I tell you what you do. Set up a meeting with her and
then call me. I’m never away from my telephone for more than an hour,
not even on weekends. I think you ought to go wired.”</p>
<p>“Wired?” Sherman sensed what he meant—and was appalled.</p>
<p>“Yeah. You ought to wear a recording device.”</p>
<p>“A recording device?” Beyond Killian’s shoulder Sherman became aware
once more of the vast and bilious gloom of the lobby, of the dark
shambling forms leaning into the telephone shells, wandering this way
and that with their huge sneakers and curious rolling gaits, huddling
together in their miserable tête-à-têtes, of Mickey Elevator cruising
along the edges of this raggedy and miserable herd.</p>
<p>“Nothing to it,” said Killian, apparently thinking that Sherman’s
concern was technological. “We tape the recorder to the small of your
back. The microphone goes under your shirt. It’s no bigger than the last
joint of your little finger.”</p>
<p>“Look, Mr. Killian—”</p>
<p>“Call me Tommy. Everybody else does.”</p>
<p>Sherman paused and looked at the thin Irish face rising up from out
of a British spread collar. All at once he felt as if he were on another
planet. He would call him neither Mr. Killian nor Tommy.</p>
<p>“I’m worried about all this,” he said, “but I’m not so worried that I
would make a surreptitious recording of a conversation with someone I
feel close to. So let’s just forget about that.”</p>
<p>“It’s perfectly legal in the State of New York,” said Killian, “and
it’s done all the time. You have every right to record your own
conversations. You can do it on the telephone, you can do it in
person.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point,” said Sherman. Involuntarily he thrust his
Yale chin upward.</p>
<p>Killian shrugged. “Okay. All I’m saying is, it’s kosher, and
sometimes it’s the only way to hold people to the truth.”</p>
<p>“I…” Sherman started to enunciate a great principle but was afraid
Killian might take it as an insult. So he settled for: “I couldn’t do
it.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said Killian. “We’ll just see how things go. Try to get
hold of her anyhow, and call me if you do. And I’m gonna take a shot at
it myself.”</p>
<p>As he left the building, Sherman noticed morose huddles of people on
the steps. So many young men with stooped shoulders! So many dark faces!
For an instant he could see the tall thin boy and the powerful brute. He
wondered if it was entirely safe to be in the vicinity of a building
that daily, hourly, brought together so many defendants in criminal
cases.</p>
<p>Where Albert Vogel found these places Fallow couldn’t begin to
imagine. The Huan Li was as pompous and stiff-necked as the Regent’s
Park. Despite the fact that they were in the East Fifties, near Madison
Avenue, at the height of the lunch hour, the restaurant was nearly
silent. It may or may not have been two-thirds empty. It was difficult
to say, because of the darkness and the screens. The restaurant was all
booths and pierced screens carved of dark wood with innumerable fishhook
shapes. The darkness was such that even Vogel, barely two feet away in
the booth, looked like a Rembrandt. A highlit face, a shaft of light
turning his old grandmotherly head a brilliant white, a flash of
shirtfront bisected by a necktie—and the rest of his form dissolved into
the blackness that surrounded it. From time to time Chinese waiters and
busboys materialized soundlessly in stewards’ jackets and black bow
ties. Nevertheless, lunch with Vogel at the Huan Li had one great thing
to recommend it. The American would pay for it.</p>
<p>Vogel said, “You sure you won’t change your mind, Pete? They have a
great Chinese wine here. You ever tried Chinese wine?”</p>
<p>“Chinese wine taste like dead mouse,” said Fallow.</p>
<p>“Tastes like what?”</p>
<p>Dead mouse…Fallow didn’t even know why he said it. He wasn’t using
that expression anymore. He wasn’t even thinking it. He was now marching
shoulder to shoulder with Gerald Steiner through the world of tabloid
journalism, thanks in part to Albert Vogel, although mainly thanks to
his own brilliance. He was already in a mood to forget the contribution
of Al Vogel to his Lamb case scoop. He resented the man, with his Pete
this and Pete that, and he felt like mocking him. On the other hand,
Vogel was his pipeline to Bacon and that crowd. He wouldn’t like to have
to deal with them entirely on his own.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I prefer beer with Chinese food, Al,” said Fallow.</p>
<p>“Yeah…I can see that,” said Vogel. “Hey, waiter. Waiter! Christ,
where are the waiters? I can’t see anything in here.”</p>
<p>A beer would, in fact, be fine. Beer was practically a health-food
drink, like chamomile tea. His hangover today wasn’t serious at all, no
more than a thick fog. No pain; just the fog. Yesterday, thanks to his
enhanced status at The City Light, he had found the moment right to
invite the sexiest of the copygirls, a big-eyed blonde named Darcy
Lastrega, out to dinner. They went to Leicester’s, where he had made his
peace with Britt-Withers and even with Caroline Heftshank. They had
ended up at the Table with Nick Stopping and Tony and St. John and Billy
Cortez and some of the others. The Table had found a perfectly willing
fish in no time, a Texan named Ned Perch, who had made an astonishing
amount of money at something or other and had bought a lot of old silver
in England, as he kept mentioning. Fallow entertained the Table at
considerable length with stories about the housing project in the Bronx,
by way of acquainting everyone with his recent success. His date, Miss
Darcy Lastrega, was not captivated, however. The likes of Nick Stopping
and St. John immediately sized her up for what she was, a humorless
little American dimwit, and nobody bothered to talk to her, and she
began slumping more and more despondently into her chair. To rectify
matters, every twenty or thirty minutes Fallow turned toward her and
grasped her forearm and put his head close to hers and said in what was
supposed to seem only a half-jesting manner: “I don’t know what’s coming
over me. I must be in love. You’re not married, are you?” The first time
she obliged him with a smile. The second and third times she didn’t. The
fourth time she wasn’t there any longer. She had left the restaurant,
and he hadn’t even noticed. Billy Cortez and St. John began laughing at
him, and he took it badly. A childish little American bird—and yet it
was humiliating. After no more than three or four more glasses of wine,
he left Leicester’s himself without saying goodbye to anyone and went
home and, presently, fell asleep.</p>
<p>Vogel had managed to find a waiter and order some beer. He also asked
for some chopsticks. The Huan Li was so frankly commercial and
unconcerned about authenticity, they set the tables with ordinary hotel
silverware. How very American it was to assume that these unsmiling
Chinese would be pleased if one showed a preference for their native
implements…How very American it was to feel somehow guilty unless one
struggled over rice noodles and lumps of meat with things that looked
like enlarged knitting needles. While chasing some sort of slippery
little dumpling around a bowl, Vogel said to Fallow, “Well, Pete, tell
the truth. Didn’t I tell you? Didn’t I tell you this was gonna be a
great story?”</p>
<p>That wasn’t what Fallow wanted to hear. He didn’t want to hear that
the story, the Lamb case itself, was great. So he only nodded.</p>
<p>Vogel must have picked up this brain wave, because then he said:
“You’ve really started something. You’ve got this whole town talking.
The stuff you’ve written—it’s dynamite, Pete, dynamite.”</p>
<p>Suitably flattered, Fallow now suffered a spasm of gratitude. “I must
admit I was skeptical the first time we spoke. But you were correct.” He
lifted his glass of beer as if making a toast.</p>
<p>Vogel lowered his chin practically into the bowl in order to gobble
up the dumpling before it squirted out from between the tips of the
chopsticks. “And the great thing, Pete, is that this isn’t just one of
those passing sensations. This thing gets down to the very structure of
the city itself, the class structure, the racial structure, the way the
system is put together. That’s why it means so much to Reverend Bacon.
He’s really grateful for what you’ve done.”</p>
<p>Fallow resented these reminders of Bacon’s proprietary interest in
the story. Like most journalists who have been handed a story, Fallow
was eager to persuade himself that he had discovered and breathed life
into this clay himself.</p>
<p>“He was telling me,” Vogel continued, “he was saying how he was
amazed—you’re from England, Pete, but you come here and you put your
finger right on the central issue, which is how much is a human life
worth. Is a black life worth less than a white life? That’s what makes
this thing important.”</p>
<p>Fallow floated in the syrup for a while and then began to wonder
where this disquisition was leading.</p>
<p>“But there’s one aspect of this thing it seems to me you might hit a
little harder, and I was talking to Reverend Bacon about this.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” said Fallow. “What’s that?”</p>
<p>“The hospital, Pete. So far the hospital has gotten off kind of easy,
considering. They say they’re ‘investigating’ how this kid could come in
with a subdural concussion and just get treated for a broken wrist, but
you know what they’re gonna do. They’re gonna try to waffle out of
it.”</p>
<p>“That may very well be,” said Fallow, “but they maintain that Lamb
never told them he’d been struck by a car.”</p>
<p>“The kid was probably already half out of his head, Pete! That’s
precisely what they shoulda detected—his general condition! That’s what
I mean about a black life and a white life. No, I think it’s time to
come down hard on the hospital. And this is a good time to do it. The
story has died down a little bit, because the cops haven’t found the car
and the driver.”</p>
<p>Fallow said nothing. He resented being steered like this. Then he
said, “I’ll think it over. It seems to me they’ve made a rather complete
statement, but I’ll think it over.”</p>
<p>Vogel said, “Well, now, Pete, I wanna be completely open with you.
Bacon has already been in touch with Channel 1 about this angle, but
you’ve been our—our main man, as the saying goes, and we’d like to see
you stay out in the lead on this story.”</p>
<p>Your main man! What an odious presumption! But he hesitated to let
Vogel know how offensive it was. He said, “What is this cozy connection
between Bacon and Channel 1?”</p>
<p>“Whaddaya mean?”</p>
<p>“He gave them an exclusive on the first demonstration.”</p>
<p>“Well—that’s true, Pete. I’m gonna be completely open with you. How
did you know about that?”</p>
<p>“Their whatever you call it, anchorman, told me. Corso.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Well, the thing is, you gotta work that way. TV news is all PR.
Every day the TV news operations wait for PR people to submit menus of
things they can film, and then they choose a few. The trick is to know
how to appeal to them. They’re not very enterprising. They feel a lot
better if they’ve seen something in print first.”</p>
<p>“In The City Light, just to cite a possible example,” said
Fallow.</p>
<p>“Well—that’s true. I’m gonna be completely out front with you, Pete.
You’re a real journalist. When these TV channels see a real journalist
on to something, they hop to it.”</p>
<p>Fallow sat back and took a leisurely draught of beer in the doldrum
gloaming of the Huan Li. Yes, his next coup would be a story exposing
television news for what it really was. But for now he would forget
that. The way the television news people came running in his footsteps
on the Lamb case—nothing had ever made him look quite so good.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes he had worked it out in his mind that a story on
the hospital’s negligence was nothing more than the natural next step.
He would have thought of that on his own, inevitably, with or without
this ridiculous Yank and his chubby face, pinky-winky as could be.</p>
<p>Today’s sandwiches came to Jimmy Caughey, Ray Andriutti, and Larry
Kramer from the State of New York, courtesy of the Willie Francisco
case. It had taken Judge Meldnick a mere four days to ask around and
find out what his opinion was of Willie’s petition for a mistrial, and
this morning he had given it. He declared a mistrial, based on the fat
old Irish juror McGuigan’s attack of the doubts. But since the day had
begun with the trial technically still in progress, Bernie Fitzgibbon’s
secretary, Gloria, was entitled duly to order the sandwiches.</p>
<p>Ray was once more lunging across his desk eating a super-sub and
drinking his vat of yellow coffee. Kramer was eating a roast beef that
tasted like chemicals. Jimmy was scarcely touching his. He was still
moaning over the disintegration of such an easy one. He had an
outstanding record. The Homicide Bureau kept actual standings, like
baseball standings, showing how many guilty pleas and guilty verdicts
each assistant district attorney had scored, and Jimmy Caughey hadn’t
lost a case in two years. His anger had now developed into an intense
hatred of Willie Francisco and the vileness of his deed, which to
Andriutti and Kramer sounded like just another piece a shit. It was
strange to see Jimmy in this state. Ordinarily he had the black Irish
coolness of Fitzgibbon himself.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen this happen before,” he said. “You put these germs on
trial, and they think they’re stars. You see Willie in there jumping up
and down and yelling ‘Mistrial’?”</p>
<p>Kramer nodded yes.</p>
<p>“Now he’s a legal expert. In fact, he’s one a the stupidest fucks
ever went on trial in Bronx County. I told Bietelberg two days ago that
if Meldnick declared a mistrial—and I mean, he had to declare a
mistrial—we were willing to make a deal. We’d reduce the charge from
murder two to manslaughter one, just to avoid another trial. But no.
He’s too shrewd for that, Willie is. He takes this as an admission of
defeat. He thinks he has a power over juries or something. On retrial
he’s gonna go down like a fucking stone. Twelve and a half to
twenty-five he’s gonna get himself, instead of three to six or four to
eight.”</p>
<p>Ray Andriutti gave up whaling down his super-sub long enough to say,
“Maybe he’s smart, Jimmy. If he takes a plea, he’s going to jail for
sure. With a fucking Bronx jury, it’s a roll of the dice every time. You
hear what happened yesterday?”</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>“This doctor from out in Montauk?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“This doctor, I mean he’s some local doctor out in Montauk, probably
never laid eyes on the Bronx before. He has a patient with some esoteric
tropical disease. The guy’s very sick, and the hospital out there don’t
think they can handle it, but there’s this hospital in Westchester with
some kind of special unit for this stuff. So the doctor arranges for an
ambulance for the guy and gets on the ambulance with him and rides all
the way to Westchester with the guy, and the guy dies in the emergency
room in Westchester. So the family brings suit against the doctor for
malpractice. But where do they bring suit? In Montauk? Westchester? No
way. The Bronx.”</p>
<p>“How can they bring suit here?” asked Kramer.</p>
<p>“The fucking ambulance had to go up the Major Deegan to get to
Westchester. So their lawyer comes up with the theory that the
malpractice occurs in the Bronx, and that’s where they had the trial.
Eight million dollars they were awarded. The jury came in yesterday. Now
there’s a lawyer who knows his geography.”</p>
<p>“Aw hell,” said Jimmy Caughey, “I bet you every negligence lawyer in
America knows about the Bronx. In a civil case a Bronx jury is a vehicle
for redistributing the wealth.”</p>
<p>A Bronx jury…And all at once Kramer was no longer thinking of the
same cluster of dark faces that Ray and Jimmy were thinking of…He was
thinking of those perfect smiling teeth and those sweet full lips
glistening with brown lipstick and those shining eyes across a little
table in the very heart of…the Life…which existed only in
Manhattan…Jesus…He was broke after he paid the bill at Muldowny’s…but
when he hailed her a cab out in front of the place and he held out his
hand to thank her and say goodbye, she let her hand stay in his, and he
increased the pressure, and she squeezed back, and they stayed that way,
looking into each other’s eyes, and—God!—that moment was sweeter,
sexier, more full of—goddamn it!—love, genuine love, the love that just
hits you and…fills up your heart…than any of those slam-bang first-date
scores he used to pride himself on when he was out prowling like a
goddamned cat…No, he would forgive Bronx juries a lot. A Bronx jury had
brought into his life the woman he had been destined to meet all
along…Love, Destiny, How Full My Heart…Let others shrink from the
meaning of those terms…Ray whaling down his super-sub, Jimmy grousing
morosely about Willie Francisco and Lester McGuigan…Larry Kramer existed
on a more spiritual plane…</p>
<p>Ray’s telephone rang. He picked it up and said,
“Homicide…Unnh-hunnh…Bernie’s not here…The Lamb case? Kramer…Larry.” Ray
looked at Kramer and pulled a face. “He’s right here. You wanna speak to
him?…Okay, just a second.” He covered the mouthpiece and said, “It’s a
guy from Legal Aid named Cecil Hayden.”</p>
<p>Kramer got up from his desk and walked over to Andriutti’s and took
the telephone. “Kramer.”</p>
<p>“Larry, this is Cecil Hayden over at Legal Aid.” A breezy voice this
Cecil Hayden had. “You’re handling the Henry Lamb case. Right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“Larry, I think the time has come to play Let’s Make a Deal.” Very
breezy.</p>
<p>“What kinda deal?”</p>
<p>“I represent an individual named Roland Auburn, who was indicted two
days ago by a grand jury on a charge of criminal possession and sale of
drugs. Weiss put out a press release describing him as the Crack King of
Evergreen Avenue. My client was immensely flattered. If you ever saw
Evergreen Avenue, you’d ask why. The King is unable to make ten thousand
dollars bail and is currently on Rikers Island.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, what’s he got to do with the Lamb case?”</p>
<p>“He says he was with Henry Lamb when he was hit by the car. He took
him to the hospital. He can give you a description of the driver. He
wants to make a deal.”</p>
