<h4 id="styrofoam-peanuts">22. Styrofoam Peanuts</h4>
<p>Sherman turned over onto his left side, but soon his left knee
developed an ache, as if the weight of his right leg were cutting off
the circulation. His heart was beating a little fast. He turned over
onto his right side. Somehow the heel of his right hand ended up under
his right cheek. It felt as if he needed it to support his head, because
the pillow wasn’t enough, but that made no sense, and anyhow, how could
he possibly get to sleep with his hand under his head? A little fast,
that was all…It wasn’t running away…He turned back onto his left side
and then rolled over flat on his stomach, but that put a strain on the
small of his back, and so he rolled back over on his right side. He
usually slept on his right side. His heart was going faster now. But it
was an even beat. He still had it under control.</p>
<p>He resisted the temptation to open his eyes and check out the
intensity of the light under the Roman shades. The line gradually
brightened toward dawn, so that you could always tell when it was
getting on toward 5:30 or 6:00 at this time of year. Suppose it was
brightening already! But that couldn’t be. It couldn’t be more than
three o’clock, 3:30 at the worst. But maybe he had slept for an hour or
so without knowing it!—and suppose the lines of light—</p>
<p>He could resist no longer. He opened his eyes. Thank God; still dim;
so he was still safe.</p>
<p>With that—his heart bolted away from him. It began pounding at a
terrific rate and with terrific force, trying to escape from his rib
cage. It made his whole body shake. What did it matter whether he had a
few more hours to lie here writhing on his bed or whether the heat of
the dawn had already cooked up under the shades and the time had
come—</p>
<p>I’m going to jail.</p>
<p>With his heart pounding and his eyes open, he was now terribly
conscious of being alone in this vast bed. Billows of silk hung down
from the ceiling at the four corners of the bed. More than 25 a yard the
silk had cost. It was Judy’s Decorator approximation of a royal
bedchamber from the eighteenth century. Royal! What a mockery it was of
himself, a throbbing lump of flesh and fear cowering in bed in the dead
of the night!</p>
<p>I’m going to jail.</p>
<p>If Judy had been here next to him, if she hadn’t gone to bed in the
guest bedroom, he would have put his arms around her and held on for
dear life. He wanted to embrace her, longed for it—</p>
<p>And with the next breath: What good would that do? None whatsoever.
It would make him feel even weaker and more helpless. Was she asleep?
What if he walked into the guest room? She often slept flat on her back,
like a recumbent statue, like the statue of…He couldn’t remember whose
statue it was. He could see the slightly yellowish marble and the folds
in the sheet that covered the body—someone famous, beloved and dead.
Well, down the hall Campbell was asleep, for sure. He knew that much. He
had looked in her room and watched her for a minute, as if this were the
last time he would ever see her. She slept with her lips slightly parted
and her body and soul utterly abandoned to the security and peace of her
home and family. She had gone to sleep almost at once. Nothing that he
had said to her was real…arrest…newspapers… “You’ll be in history?”…If
only he knew what she was thinking! Supposedly children picked up things
in more ways than you knew, from the tone of your voice, the look on
your face…But Campbell seemed to know only that something sad and
exciting was about to happen, and her father was unhappy. Utterly
insulated from the world…in the bosom of her family…her lips slightly
parted…just down the hall…For her sake he had to pull himself together.
And for the moment, anyway, he did. His heart slowed down. He began to
take command of his body again. He would be strong for her, if for no
one else on earth. I am a man. When he had to fight, he had fought. He
had fought in the jungle, and he had won. The furious moment when he
thrust the tire at the…brute…The brute was sprawled on the
pavement…Henry!…If he had to, he would fight again. How bad could it
be?</p>
<p>Last night, as long as he was talking to Killian, he had it worked
out in his mind. It wasn’t going to be so bad. Killian explained every
step. It was a formality, not a pleasant formality, but not like really
going to jail, either. It would not be like an ordinary arrest. Killian
would see to that, Killian and his friend Fitzgibbon. A contract. Not
like an ordinary arrest, not like an ordinary arrest; he clung to this
phrase, “not like an ordinary arrest.” Like what, then? He tried to
picture how it was going to be, and before he knew it, his heart was
racing, fleeing, panicked, amok with fear.</p>
<p>Killian had arranged it so that the two detectives, Martin and
Goldberg, would drive by and pick him up about 7:30 on their way to work
on the 8:00 a.m. shift in the Bronx. They both lived on Long Island, and
they drove to the Bronx every day, and so they would make a detour and
drive by and pick him up on Park Avenue. Killian would be here when they
arrived, and he would ride up to the Bronx with him and be there when
they arrested him—and this was special treatment.</p>
<p>Lying there in bed, with cascades of 25-a-yard silk at every corner,
he closed his eyes and tried to think it through. He would get in the
car with the two detectives, the small one and the fat one. Killian
would be with him. They would go up the FDR Drive to the Bronx. The
detectives would get him to Central Booking first thing, as the new
shift began, and he would go through the process first, before the day’s
buildup of cases. Central Booking—but what was it? Last night it had
been a name Killian had used so matter-of-factly. But now, lying here,
he realized he had no idea what it would look like. The process—what
process? Being arrested! Despite everything Killian had tried to
explain, it was unimaginable. He would be fingerprinted. How? And his
fingerprints would be transmitted to Albany by a computer. Why? To make
sure there were no warrants for his arrest already outstanding. But
surely they knew better! Until the report from Albany came back, via the
computer, he would have to wait in the detention pens. Pens! That was
the word Killian kept using. Pens!—for what sort of animals! As if
reading his mind, Killian had told him not to worry about the things you
read about concerning jails. The unmentioned term was homosexual rape.
The pens were temporary cells for people who had been arrested and were
awaiting arraignment. Since arrests in the early daylight hours were
rare, he might very well have the place to himself. After the report
came back, he would go upstairs to appear before a judge. Upstairs! But
what did that mean? Upstairs from what? He would plead not guilty and be
released on 0,000 bail—tomorrow—in a few hours—when the dawn cooks up
the light beneath the shade—</p>
<p>I’m going to jail—as the man who ran down a black honor student and
left him to die!</p>
<p>His heart was beating violently now. His pajamas were wet with
perspiration. He had to stop thinking. He had to close his eyes. He had
to sleep. He tried to focus on an imaginary point between his eyes.
Behind his eyelids…little movies…curling forms…a pair of puffy
sleeves…They turned into a shirt, his own white shirt. Nothing too good,
Killian said, because the holding pens might be filthy. But a suit and
tie, of course, nonetheless, since this was not an ordinary arrest, not
an ordinary arrest…The old blue-gray tweed suit, the one made in
England…a white shirt, a solid navy tie or maybe the medium-blue tie
with the pin dots…No, the navy tie, which would be dignified but not at
all showy—for going to jail in!</p>
<p>He opened his eyes. The silk billowed down from the ceiling. “Get a
grip on yourself!” He said it out loud. Surely this was not actually
about to happen. I’m going to jail.</p>
<p>About 5:30, with the light turning yellow under the shade, Sherman
gave up on the idea of sleep, or even rest, and got up. To his surprise,
it made him feel a little better. His heartbeat was rapid, but he had
the panic under control. It helped to be doing something, if only taking
a shower and putting on the blue-gray tweed suit and the navy necktie…my
jail outfit. The face he saw in the mirror didn’t look as tired as he
felt. The Yale chin; he looked strong.</p>
<p>He wanted to eat breakfast and be out of the apartment before
Campbell got up. He wasn’t sure he could be brave enough in front of
her. He also didn’t want to have to talk to Bonita. It would be too
awkward. As for Judy, he didn’t know what he wanted. He didn’t want to
see the look in her eye, which was the numb look of someone betrayed but
also shocked and frightened. Yet he wanted his wife with him. In fact,
he had scarcely had a glass of orange juice before Judy arrived in the
kitchen, dressed and ready for the day. She hadn’t had much more sleep
than he had. A moment later Bonita came in from the servants’ wing and
quietly began fixing them breakfast. Soon enough Sherman was glad Bonita
was there. He didn’t know what to say to Judy. With Bonita present he
obviously wouldn’t be able to say much. He could barely eat. He had
three cups of coffee in hopes of clearing his head.</p>
<p>At 7:15 the doorman called up to say that Mr. Killian was downstairs.
Judy walked with Sherman out into the entry gallery. He stopped and
looked at her. She attempted a smile of encouragement, but it gave her
face a look of terrible weariness. In a low but firm voice, she said:
“Sherman, be brave. Remember who you are.” She opened her mouth, as if
she was about to say something more; but she didn’t.</p>
<p>And that was it! That was the best she could do! I try to see more in
you, Sherman, but all that’s left is the shell, your dignity!</p>
<p>He nodded. He couldn’t get a word out. He turned and went to the
elevator.</p>
<p>Killian was standing under the marquee just outside the front door.
He was wearing a chalk-striped gray suit, brown suede shoes, a brown
fedora. (How dare he be so debonair on the day of my doom?) Park Avenue
was an ashy gray. The sky was dark. It looked as if it was about to
rain…Sherman shook hands with Killian, then moved down the sidewalk
about twenty feet, to be out of earshot of the doorman.</p>
<p>“How do you feel?” asked Killian. He asked it the way you ask a sick
person.</p>
<p>“Top-notch,” said Sherman, with a morose smile.</p>
<p>“It’s not gonna be so bad. I talked to Bernie Fitzgibbon again last
night, after I talked to you. He’s gonna get you through there as fast
as possible. Fucking Abe Weiss, he’s a wet finger in the wind. All this
publicity has him terrified. Otherwise not even an idiot like him would
do this.”</p>
<p>Sherman just shook his head. He was far beyond speculation on the
mentality of Abe Weiss. I’m going to jail!</p>
<p>Out of the corner of his eye, Sherman saw a car pull up alongside
them, and then he saw the detective, Martin, at the wheel. The car was a
two-door Oldsmobile Cutlass, reasonably new, and Martin had on a jacket
and tie, and so perhaps the doorman would not figure it out. Oh, they
would know soon enough, all the doormen and matrons and money managers
and general partners and bond traders and CEOs and all their
private-school children and nannies and governesses and housekeepers,
all the inhabitants of this social fortress. But that anyone might see
he was being led away by the police was more than he could bear.</p>
<p>The car had stopped just far enough away from the door of the
building that the doorman didn’t come out. Martin got out and opened the
door and pulled the seat back forward, so that Sherman and Killian could
get into the rear. Martin smiled at Sherman. The smile of the
tormentor!</p>
<p>“Hey, Counselor!” Martin said to Killian. Very cheery about it, too.
“Bill Martin,” he said, and he held out his hand, and he and Killian
shook hands. “Bernie Fitzgibbon tells me you guys worked together.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” said Killian.</p>
<p>“Bernie’s a pistol.”</p>
<p>“Worse than that. I could tell ya some stories.”</p>
<p>Martin chuckled, and Sherman experienced a small spurt of hope.
Killian knew this man Fitzgibbon, who was the chief of the Homicide
Bureau of the Bronx District Attorney’s Office, and Fitzgibbon knew
Martin, and now Martin knew Killian…and Killian—Killian was his
protector!…Just before Sherman bent down to get into the back seat,
Martin said, “Watch your clothes back there. There’re these
fucking—’scuse my French—Styrofoam peanuts back there. My kid opened up
a box, and all these white peanuts they pack things in got all over the
place, and they stick to your clothes and every other goddamned
thing.”</p>
<p>Once he bent down, Sherman saw the fat one with the mustache,
Goldberg, sitting in the front passenger seat. He had a bigger smile
on.</p>
<p>“Sherman.” He said it the way you’d say hello or good morning. Most
amiably. And the whole world froze, congealed. My first name! A
servant…a slave…a prisoner…Sherman said nothing. Martin introduced
Killian to Goldberg. More cheery lodge talk.</p>
<p>Sherman was sitting behind Goldberg. There were, indeed, white
Styrofoam packing peanuts all over the place. Two had attached
themselves to Sherman’s pants leg. One was practically on top of his
knee. He picked it off and then had trouble getting it off his finger.
He could feel another one under his bottom and began fishing around for
that.</p>
<p>They had barely started off, heading up Park Avenue toward
Ninety-sixth Street and the entrance to the FDR Drive, when Goldberg
turned around in his seat and said, “You know, I got a daughter in high
school, and she loves to read, and she was reading this book, and this
outfit you work for—Pierce andandandand Pierce, right?—they were in
it.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Sherman managed to say. “What was the book?”</p>
<p>“I think it was Murder Mania. Something like that.”</p>
<p>Murder Mania? The book was called Merger Mania. Was he trying to
torment him with some hideous joke?</p>
<p>“Murder Mania!” said Martin. “F’r Chrissake, Goldberg, it’s Mer-ger
Mania.” Then over his shoulder to Killian and Sherman: “It’s great to
have a partner who’s a intellectual.” To his partner: “What shape’s a
book, Goldberg? A circle or a triangle?”</p>
<p>“I’ll show you what shape,” said Goldberg, extending the middle
finger of his right hand. Then he twisted around toward Sherman again:
“Anyway, she really liked that book, and she’s only in high school. She
says she wants to work on Wall Street when she finishes college. Or
that’s this week’s plan, anyway.”</p>
<p>This one, Goldberg, also! The same appalling malapert slavemaster
friendliness! Now he was supposed to like the two of them! Now that the
game was over, and he had lost, and he belonged to them, he should hold
nothing against them. He should admire them. They had their hooks in a
Wall Street investment banker, and what was he now? Their catch! Their
quarry! Their prize pet! In an Oldsmobile Cutlass! The brutes from the
outer boroughs—the sort of people you saw heading on Fifty-eighth Street
or Fifty-ninth Street toward the Queensboro Bridge—fat young men with
drooping mustaches, like Goldberg…and now he belonged to them.</p>
<p>At Ninety-third Street, a doorman was helping an old woman out the
door and onto the sidewalk. She wore a caracal overcoat. It was the sort
of very formal black fur coat you never saw anymore. A long happy
insulated life on Park Avenue! Heartlessly, Park Avenue, le tout New
York, would go on living its everyday life.</p>
<p>“All right,” Killian said to Martin, “let’s get it straight exactly
what we’re gonna do here. We’re going in the 161st Street entrance,
right? And then we go downstairs from there, and the Angel takes
Sherman—Mr. McCoy—straight into fingerprinting. The Angel’s still
there?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Martin, “he’s still there, but we gotta go in around the
side, through the outside door to Central Booking.”</p>
<p>“What for?”</p>
<p>“That’s my orders. The zone captain’s gonna be there, and the press
is gonna be there.”</p>
<p>“The press!”</p>
<p>“That’s right. And we gotta have cuffs on him by the time we get
there.”</p>
<p>“Are you shitting me? I talked to Bernie last night. He gave me his
word. There’s gonna be no bullshit.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about Bernie. This is Abe Weiss. This is the way Weiss
wants it, and I got my orders straight from the zone captain. This
arrest is supposed to be by the book. You’re getting a break as it is.
You know what they were talking about, don’t you? They wanted to bring
the fucking press to his apartment and cuff him there.”</p>
<p>Killian glowered at Martin. “Who toldja to do this?”</p>
<p>“Captain Crowther.”</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“Last night. He called me at home. Listen, you know Weiss. What can I
tell ya?”</p>
<p>“This…is…not…right,” said Killian. “I had Bernie’s word.
This…is…very…wrong. You don’t pull this kinda thing.
This…is…not…right.”</p>
<p>Both Martin and Goldberg turned around and looked at him.</p>
<p>“I’m not gonna forget this,” said Killian, “and I’m not happy.”</p>
<p>“Ayyyyy…whaddaya whaddaya,” said Martin. “Don’t blame it on us,
because it’s all the same to us one way or the other. Your beef is with
Weiss.”</p>
<p>They were now out on the FDR Drive, heading north toward the Bronx.
It had begun to rain. The morning traffic was already backing up on the
other side of the railing that divided the expressway, but there was
nothing holding them back on this side of the road. They approached a
footbridge that arched over the river from the Manhattan side to an
island out in the middle. The trestle had been painted a hot heliotrope
purple in a burst of euphoria in the 1970s. The false hopefulness of it
depressed Sherman profoundly.</p>
<p>I’m going to jail!</p>
<p>Goldberg craned around again. “Look,” he said, “I’m sorry, but I
gotta put on the cuffs. I can’t be fucking around with ’em when we get
there.”</p>
<p>“This is pure bullshit,” said Killian. “I hope you know that.”</p>
<p>“It’s the lawwwr!” said Goldberg plaintively. He put an r on the end
of law. “If you bring somebody in on a felony, you’re supposed to put on
the cuffs. I’ll grant you there’s times I ain’t done that, but the
fucking zone captain is gonna be there.”</p>
<p>Goldberg held up his right hand. He held a pair of handcuffs. “Give
me your wrists,” he said to Sherman. “We can get this over with.”</p>
<p>Sherman looked at Killian. The muscles in Killian’s jaws were bunched
up. “Yeah, go ahead!” he said to Sherman with the sort of high-pitched
emphasis that insinuates, “Someone is gonna pay for this!”</p>
<p>Martin said, “I tell you what. Why don’t you take your jacket off.
He’ll cuff you in front instead of in back, and you can hold the jacket
over your wrists, and you won’t even be able to see the fucking
cuffs.”</p>
<p>The way he said it, it was as if the four of them were friends, all
pulling together against an unkind fate. For an instant, that made
Sherman feel better. He struggled out of his tweed jacket. Then he
leaned forward and put his hands through the gap between the two front
seats.</p>
<p>They were crossing a bridge…perhaps the Willis Avenue Bridge…he
didn’t really know what bridge it was. All he knew was that it was a
bridge, and it went across the Harlem River, away from Manhattan.
Goldberg snapped the cuffs onto his wrists. Sherman sank back into the
seat and looked down, and there he was, in manacles.</p>
<p>The rain was coming down harder. They reached the other end of the
bridge. Well, here it was, the Bronx. It was like an old and decrepit
part of Providence, Rhode Island. There were some massive but low
buildings, grimy and moldering, and broad weary black streets running up
and down slopes. Martin drove down a ramp and onto another
expressway.</p>
<p>Sherman reached around to his right to retrieve his jacket and put it
over the handcuffs. When he realized that he had to move both hands in
order to pick up the coat, and when the effort caused the manacles to
cut into his wrists, a flood of humiliation…and shame!…swept over him.
This was himself, the very self who existed in a unique and sacrosanct
and impenetrable crucible at the center of his mind, who was now in
manacles…in the Bronx…Surely this was a hallucination, a nightmare, a
trick of the mind, and he would pull back a translucent layer…and…The
rain came down harder, the windshield wipers were sweeping back and
forth in front of the two policemen.</p>
<p>With the handcuffs on, he couldn’t drape the jacket over his wrists.
It kept balling up. So Killian helped him. There were three or four
Styrofoam peanuts on the jacket. There were two more on his pant leg. He
couldn’t possibly get to them with his fingers. Perhaps Killian…But what
did it matter?</p>
<p>Up ahead, to the right…Yankee Stadium!…An anchor! Something to hold
on to! He had been to Yankee Stadium! For World Series games, nothing
more…Nevertheless, he had been there! It was part of a sane and decent
world! It was not this…Congo!</p>
<p>The car went down a ramp, leaving the expressway. The road went
around the base of the huge bowl of the stadium. It wasn’t forty feet
away. There was a fat man with white hair wearing a New York Yankees
warm-up jacket standing outside what looked like a little office door.
Sherman had been to the World Series with Gordon Schoenburg, whose
company had box seats for the season, and Gordon had served a picnic
supper between the fifth and sixth innings from one of those wicker
picnic baskets with all the compartments and stainless-steel utensils,
and he had served sourdough bread and pâté and caviar to everybody,
which had infuriated some drunks, who saw it from the walkway behind and
started saying some very abusive things and repeating a word they heard
Gordon say. The word was really, which they repeated over and over as
rilly. “Oh, rilly?” they said. “Oh, rilly?” It was the next thing to
calling Gordon a faggot, and Sherman always remembered that, even though
no one spoke about it afterward. The abuse! The pointless hostility! The
resentment! Martin and Goldberg! They were all Martins and
Goldbergs.</p>
<p>Then Martin turned onto a very wide street, and they went underneath
some elevated subway tracks and headed up a hill. There were mostly dark
faces on the sidewalk, hurrying along in the rain. They all looked so
dark and sodden. A lot of gray decrepit little shops, like the decaying
downtowns of cities all across America, like Chicago’s, Akron’s,
Allentown’s…The Daffyteria, the Snooker deli, Korn Luggage, the B.
andandandand G. Davidoff Travel andandandand Cruise…</p>
<p>The windshield wipers swept aside sheets of rain. At the top of the
hill there was an imposing limestone building that appeared to take up
an entire block, the sort of monumental pile you see in the District of
Columbia. Across the way, on the side of a low office building, was a
prodigious sign reading, ANGELO COLON, U.S. CONGRESS. They went over the
crest of the hill. What he saw down the slope on the other side shocked
him. It was not merely decrepit and sodden but ruined, as though in some
catastrophe. To the right an entire block was nothing but a great hole
in the ground with cyclone fencing around it and raggedy catalpa trees
sticking up here and there. At first it appeared to be a junkyard. Then
he could see it was a parking lot, a vast pit for cars and trucks,
apparently unpaved. Over to the left was a new building, modern in the
cheap sense of the word, quite dreary-looking in the rain.</p>
<p>Martin stopped and waited for the traffic coming the other way, so he
could turn left.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Sherman asked Killian, motioning toward the building
with his head.</p>
<p>“The Criminal Courts Building.”</p>
<p>“That’s where we’re going?”</p>
<p>Killian nodded yes and then stared straight ahead. He looked tense.
Sherman could feel his heart going to town. It palpitated every now and
then.</p>
<p>Instead of pulling up in front of the building, Martin drove down an
incline to one side. There, near a mean little metal door, was a line of
men and, behind them, a promiscuous huddle of people, thirty or forty of
them, most of them white, all hunched over in the rain wrapped in
ponchos, thermal jackets, dirty raincoats. A welfare office, thought
Sherman. No, a soup kitchen. They looked like the people he had seen
lined up for the soup-kitchen lunches at the church, at Madison Avenue
and Seventy-first Street. But then their desperate beaten eyes all
turned, as if on a command, toward the car—toward him—and all at once he
was aware of the cameras.</p>
<p>The mob seemed to shake itself, like a huge filthy sprawling dog, and
came bounding toward the car. Some of them were running, and he could
see television cameras jouncing up and down.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ,” Martin said to Goldberg. “Get out and get that door
open or we’ll never even get him out of the fucking car.”</p>
<p>Goldberg jumped out. Immediately the shaggy sodden people were
everywhere. Sherman could no longer see the building. He could only see
the mob closing in on the car.</p>
<p>Killian said to Sherman, “Now listen. You don’t say anything. You
don’t show any expression whatsoever. You don’t cover your face, you
don’t hang your head. You don’t even know they’re there. You can’t win
with these assholes, so don’t even try. Let me get out first.”</p>
<p>Bango!—somehow Killian swung both feet over Sherman’s knees and
rolled over him, all in one motion. His elbows hit Sherman’s crossed
hands and drove the handcuffs into his lower abdomen. Sherman’s tweed
jacket was bunched up over his hands. There were five or six Styrofoam
peanuts on the jacket, but there was nothing he could do about it. The
door was open, and Killian was out of the car. Goldberg and Killian had
their hands out toward him. Sherman swung his feet out. Killian,
Goldberg, and Martin had created a pocket around the door with their
bodies. The mob of reporters, photographers, and cameramen was on top of
them. People were shouting. At first he thought it was a melee. They
were trying to get him! Killian reached in under Sherman’s coat and
pulled him upright by the handcuffs. Someone stuck a camera over
Killian’s shoulder and into Sherman’s face. He ducked. When he looked
down, he could see that five, six, seven, Christ knew how many Styrofoam
peanuts were stuck to his pants legs. They were all over his coat and
his pants. The rain was streaming down his forehead and his cheeks. He
started to wipe his face, but then he realized he would have to raise
both hands and his jacket to do it, and he didn’t want them to see his
handcuffs. So the water just rolled down. He could feel it rolling down
his shirt collar. Because of the handcuffs, his shoulders were slumped
forward. He tried to throw his shoulders back, but all at once Goldberg
yanked him forward by one elbow. He was trying to get him through the
mob.</p>
<p>“Sherman!”</p>
<p>“Over here, Sherman!”</p>
<p>“Hey, Sherman!”</p>
<p>They were all yelling Sherman! His first name! He was theirs, too!
The looks on their faces! Such pitiless intensity! They jammed their
microphones toward him. Someone came barreling into Goldberg, knocking
him back against Sherman. A camera appeared over Goldberg’s shoulder.
Goldberg swung his elbow and forearm forward with tremendous force, and
there was a thumpf, and the camera fell to the ground. Goldberg still
had his other arm hooked inside Sherman’s elbow. The force of Goldberg’s
punch pulled Sherman off balance. Sherman stepped to the side, and his
foot landed on the leg of a man who was writhing on the ground. He was a
little man with dark curly hair. Goldberg stepped on his abdomen for
good measure. The man went Ooooohahhh.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sherman! Hey, shitface!”</p>
<p>Startled, Sherman looked to the side. It was a photographer. His
camera covered half his face. The other side had a piece of white paper
stuck on it. Toilet paper. Sherman could see the man’s lips moving.
“That’s it, shitface, look right here!”</p>
<p>Martin was a step in front of Sherman, trying to clear a path.
“Coming through! Coming through! Get outta the way!”</p>
<p>Killian took Sherman’s other elbow and tried to shield him from that
side. But now both of his elbows were being pulled forward, and he was
conscious of shambling forward, drenched, with his shoulders stooped. He
couldn’t keep his head up.</p>
<p>“Sherman!” A woman’s voice. A microphone was in his face. “Have you
ever been arrested before?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Sherman! How you gonna plead?”</p>
<p>“Sherman! Who’s the brunette?”</p>
<p>“Sherman! Did you mean to hit him?”</p>
<p>They were sticking the microphones between Killian and Martin and
between Martin and Goldberg. Sherman tried to keep his head up, but one
of the microphones hit him in the chin. He kept flinching. Every time he
looked down, he could see the white Styrofoam peanuts on his jacket and
his pants.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sherman! Fuckhead! How you like this cocktail party!”</p>
<p>Such abuse! It was coming from photographers. Anything to try to make
him look their way, but—such abuse! such filth! There was nothing too
vile to abuse him with! He was now…theirs! Their creature! He had been
thrown to them! They could do what they wanted! He hated them—but he
felt so ashamed. The rain was running into his eyes. He couldn’t do
anything about it. His shirt was soaked. They were no longer moving
forward as before. The little metal door was no more than twenty-five
feet away. A line of men was jammed up in front of them. They weren’t
reporters or photographers or cameramen. Some of them were uniformed
policemen. Some of them seemed to be Latins, young men mostly. Then
there were some white…derelicts…winos…but, no, they wore badges. They
were policemen. They were all standing in the rain. They were soaking
wet. Martin and Goldberg were now pressing up against the Latinos and
the policemen, with Killian and Sherman in close behind them. Goldberg
and Killian still had Sherman’s elbows. The reporters and cameramen were
still coming at him from the sides and from behind.</p>
<p>“Sherman! Hey! Give us a statement!”</p>
<p>“Just one shot!”</p>
<p>“Hey, Sherman! Why’dja hit him?”</p>
<p>“…Park Avenue!…”</p>
<p>“…intentionally!…”</p>
<p>Martin turned and said to Goldberg, “Jesus Christ, they just busted
that social club up on 167th. There’s twelve fucking spaced-out carambas
in line waiting to get into Central Booking!”</p>
<p>“Beautiful,” said Goldberg.</p>
<p>“Look,” said Killian, “you gotta get him inside a there. Talk to
Crowther, if you have to, but get him in there.”</p>
<p>Martin shoved his way out of the mob, and in no time he was back.</p>
<p>“No go,” said Martin, with an apologetic shake of the head. “He says
this one’s gotta be by the book. He’s gotta wait on line.”</p>
<p>“This is very wrong,” said Killian.</p>
<p>Martin arched his eyebrows. (I know, I know, but what can I do?)</p>
<p>“Sherman! How about a statement!”</p>
<p>“Sherman! Hey, cuntface!”</p>
<p>“All right!” It was Killian, yelling. “You want a statement?
Mr. McCoy’s not gonna make a statement. I’m his attorney, and I’m gonna
make a statement.”</p>
<p>More pushing and jostling. The microphones and cameras now converged
on Killian.</p>
<p>Sherman stood just behind him. Killian let go of Sherman’s elbow, but
Goldberg still had the other one.</p>
<p>Somebody yelled, “What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Thomas Killian.”</p>
<p>“Howdaya spell it?”</p>
<p>“K-I-L-L-I-A-N. Okay? This is a circus arrest! My client has been
ready at all times to appear before a grand jury to confront the charges
brought against him. Instead, this circus arrest has been staged in
complete violation of an agreement between the district attorney and my
client.”</p>
<p>“What was he doing in the Bronx?”</p>
<p>“That’s the statement, and that’s the whole statement.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying he’s innocent?”</p>
<p>“Mr. McCoy denies these charges completely, and this outrageous
circus arrest shoulda never been allowed.”</p>
<p>The shoulders of Killian’s suit were drenched. The rain had gone
through Sherman’s shirt, and he could feel the water on his skin.</p>
<p>“¡Mira! ¡Mira!” One of the Latins kept saying this word ¡Mira!</p>
<p>Sherman stood there with his shoulders drenched and bowed. He could
feel the sopping jacket weighing down on his wrists. Over Killian’s
shoulder he could see a thicket of microphones. He could hear the
cameras whining away. The horrible fire in their faces! He wanted to
die. He had never really wanted to die before, although, like many other
souls, he had toyed with the feeling. Now he truly wanted God or Death
to deliver him. That was how dreadful the feeling was, and that feeling
was, in fact, a scalding shame.</p>
<p>“Sherman!”</p>
<p>“Fuckface!”</p>
<p>“¡Mira! ¡Mira!”</p>
<p>And then he was dead, so dead he couldn’t even die. He didn’t even
possess the willpower to fall down. The reporters and cameramen and
photographers—such vile abuse!—still here, not three feet away!—they
were the maggots and the flies, and he was the dead beast they had found
to crawl over and root into.</p>
<p>Killian’s so-called statement had distracted them only for a moment.
Killian!—who supposedly had his connections and was going to make sure
it was not an ordinary arrest! It was not an ordinary arrest. It was
death. Every bit of honor, respect, dignity, that he, a creature named
Sherman McCoy, might ever have possessed had been removed, just like
that, and it was his dead soul that now stood here in the rain, in
handcuffs, in the Bronx, outside a mean little metal door, at the end of
a line of a dozen other prisoners. The maggots called him Sherman. They
were right on top of him.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sherman!”</p>
<p>“How you gonna plead, Sherman!”</p>
<p>Sherman looked straight ahead. Killian and the two detectives, Martin
and Goldberg, continued to try to shield Sherman from the maggots. A
television cameraman closed in, a fat one. The camera came over his
shoulder like a grenade launcher.</p>
<p>Goldberg wheeled toward the man and yelled, “Get that fucking thing
outta my face!”</p>
<p>The cameraman retreated. How odd! How completely hopeless! Goldberg
was now his protector. He was Goldberg’s creature, his animal. Goldberg
and Martin had brought their animal in, and now they were determined to
see that it was delivered.</p>
<p>Killian said to Martin, “This is not right. You guys gotta do
something.”</p>
<p>Martin shrugged. Then Killian said in all seriousness, “My shoes are
getting fucking ruined.”</p>
<p>“Mr. McCoy.”</p>
<p>Mr. McCoy. Sherman turned his head. A tall pale man with long blond
hair was at the forefront of a pack of reporters and cameramen.</p>
<p>“Peter Fallow of The City Light,” said the man. He had an English
accent, an accent so blimpish it was like a parody of an English accent.
Was he taunting him? “I’ve rung you up several times. I’d very much like
to get your side of all this.”</p>
<p>Sherman turned away…Fallow, his obsessive tormentor in The City
Light…No compunctions at all about walking up and introducing himself…of
course not…his quarry was dead…He should have hated him, and yet he
couldn’t, because he loathed himself so much more. He was dead even to
himself.</p>
<p>Finally, all the prisoners arrested in the raid on the social club
were inside the door, and Sherman, Killian, Martin, and Goldberg were
just outside. “Okay, Counselor,” Martin said to Killian, “we’ll take it
from here.”</p>
<p>Sherman looked beseechingly at Killian. (Surely you’re coming inside
with me!) Killian said, “I’ll be upstairs when they bring you up for
arraignment. Don’t worry about anything. Just remember, don’t make any
statements, don’t talk about the case, not even to anybody in the pens,
especially not to anybody in the pens.”</p>
<p>In the pens! More shouting from beyond the door.</p>
<p>“How long will it take?” asked Sherman.</p>
<p>“I don’t know exactly. They got these guys ahead a you.” Then he said
to Martin, “Look. Do the right thing. See if you can’t get him through
fingerprinting ahead a that bunch. I mean, f’r Chrissake.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try,” said Martin, “but I already told you. For some reason
they want this one step by step.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but you owe us,” said Killian. “You owe us a lot—” He stopped.
“Just do the right thing.”</p>
<p>All at once Goldberg was pulling Sherman in by the elbow. Martin was
right behind him. Sherman turned to keep Killian in sight. Killian’s hat
was so wet it looked black. His necktie and the shoulders of his suit
were soaked.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” said Killian. “It’s gonna be all right.”</p>
<p>The way Killian said it, Sherman knew his own face must be a picture
of pure despair. Then the door closed; no more Killian. Sherman was cut
off from the world. He had thought he had no fear left, only despair.
But he was afraid all over again. His heart began to pound. The door had
closed, and he had disappeared into the world of Martin and Goldberg in
the Bronx.</p>
<p>He was in a large low room broken up by cubicles, some of which had
plate-glass windows, like the interior windows of a broadcast studio.
There were no outside windows. A bright electric haze filled the room.
People in uniform were moving about, but they were not all wearing the
same sort of uniform. Two men with their hands manacled behind their
backs stood in front of a high desk. Two young men in rags were standing
beside them. One of the prisoners looked over his shoulder and saw
Sherman and nudged the other, and he turned around and looked at
Sherman, and they both laughed. Off to the side, Sherman could hear the
cry he had heard outside, a man screaming, “¡Mira! ¡Mira!” There were
some cackles and then the loud flatulent sound of someone having a bowel
movement. A deep voice said, “Yaggh. Filthy.”</p>
<p>Another one said, “Okay, get ’em outta there. Hose it down.”</p>
<p>The two men in rags were bending over behind the two prisoners.
Behind the desk was a huge policeman with an absolutely bald head, a big
nose, and a prognathous jaw. He appeared to be sixty years old at least.
The men in rags were removing the handcuffs from the two prisoners. One
of the young men in rags had on a thermal vest over a torn black
T-shirt. He wore sneakers and dirty camouflage pants, tight at the
ankles. There was a badge, a police shield, on the thermal vest. Then
Sherman could see the other had a badge, too. Another old policeman came
up to the desk and said, “Hey, Angel, Albany’s down.”</p>
<p>“Beautiful,” said the man with the bald head. “We got this bunch, and
the shift just started.”</p>
<p>Goldberg looked at Martin and rolled his eyes and smiled and then
looked at Sherman. He still held Sherman by the elbow. Sherman looked
down. Styrofoam peanuts! The Styrofoam packing peanuts he had picked up
in the back seat of Martin’s car were all over the place. They were
stuck to the wad of his jacket over his wrists. They were all over his
tweed pants. His pants were wet, wrinkled, twisted shapelessly around
his knees and his thighs, and the Styrofoam peanuts clung to them like
vermin.</p>
<p>Goldberg said to Sherman, “You see that room in there?”</p>
<p>Sherman looked over into a room, through a large plate-glass window.
There were filing cabinets and piles of paper. A big beige-and-gray
apparatus took up the center of the room. Two policemen were staring at
it.</p>
<p>“That’s the fax machine that sends the fingerprints to Albany,” said
Goldberg. He said it in a pleasant sort of singsong, the way you would
say something to a child who is frightened and confused. The very tone
terrified Sherman. “About ten years ago,” said Goldberg, “some bright
fellow got the idea—was it ten years ago, Marty?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Martin. “All I know is, it was a stupid fucking
idea.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, somebody got the idea a putting all the fingerprints, for
the whole fucking State a New York, in this one office in Albany…see…and
then every one a the Central Bookings, they’re wired into Albany, and
you send the prints to Albany on the computer, and you get back your
report, and the suspect goes upstairs and gets arraigned…see…Only it’s a
freakin’ logjam in Albany, especially when the machine goes down, like
right now.”</p>
<p>Sherman couldn’t take in a thing Goldberg was saying, except that
something had gone wrong and Goldberg thought he was going out of his
way to be nice and explain it.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Martin said to Sherman, “be thankful it’s 8:30 in the morning
and not 4:30 in the fucking afternoon. If this was the fucking
afternoon, you’d probably have to spend the night at the Bronx House of
Detention or even Rikers.”</p>
<p>“Rikers Island?” asked Sherman. He was hoarse. He barely got the
words out.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Martin, “when Albany goes down in the afternoon,
forged-aboudit. You can’t spend the night in this place, so they take
you over to Rikers. I’m telling you, you’re very fortunate.”</p>
<p>He was telling him he was very fortunate. Sherman was supposed to
like them now! Inside here, they were his only friends! Sherman felt
intensely frightened.</p>
<p>Somebody yelled out, “Who died in here, f’r Chrissake!”</p>
<p>The smell reached the desk.</p>
<p>“Now that’s disgusting,” said the bald man called Angel. He looked
around. “Hose it down!”</p>
<p>Sherman followed his eyes. Off to the side, down a corridor, he could
make out two cells. White tiles and bars; they seemed to be constructed
of white brick tiles, like a public bathroom. Two policemen stood in
front of one of them.</p>
<p>One of them yelled through the bars, “Whatsa matter with you!”</p>
<p>Sherman could feel the pressure of Goldberg’s huge hand on his elbow,
steering him forward. He was in front of the desk, staring up at the
Angel. Martin had a sheaf of papers in his hand.</p>
<p>The Angel said, “Name?”</p>
<p>Sherman tried to speak but couldn’t. His mouth was utterly dry. His
tongue seemed stuck to the roof of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Name?”</p>
<p>“Sherman McCoy.” It was barely a whisper.</p>
<p>“Address?”</p>
<p>“816 Park Avenue. New York.” He added “New York” in the interest of
being modest and obedient. He didn’t want to act as if he just assumed
people here in the Bronx knew where Park Avenue was.</p>
<p>“Park Avenue, New York. Your age?”</p>
<p>“Thirty-eight.”</p>
<p>“Ever been arrested before?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Angel,” Martin said. “Mr. McCoy here’s been very
cooperative…and uh…whyn’t you let him sit out here somewheres insteada
putting him in there with that buncha bats? The fucking so-called press
out there, they gave him a hard enough time.”</p>
<p>A wave of profound, sentimental gratitude washed over Sherman. Even
as he felt it, he knew it was irrational, but he felt it
nonetheless.</p>
<p>The Angel puffed up his cheeks and stared off, as if ruminating. Then
he said, “Can’t do it, Marty.” He closed his eyes and lifted his huge
chin upward, as if to say, “The people upstairs.”</p>
<p>“Whadda they worrying about? The fucking TV viruses got him standing
out there in the rain for a fucking half an hour. Look at him. Looks
like he crawled in here through a pipe.”</p>
<p>Goldberg chuckled. Then, so as not to offend Sherman, he said to him,
“You’re not looking your best. You know that.”</p>
<p>His only friends! Sherman wanted to cry, and all the more so because
this horrible, pathetic feeling was genuine.</p>
<p>“Can’t do it,” said the Angel. “Gotta do the whole routine.” He
closed his eyes and lifted his chin again. “You can take the cuffs
off.”</p>
<p>Martin looked at Sherman and twisted his mouth to one side. (Well,
friend, we tried.) Goldberg unlocked the handcuffs and took them off
Sherman’s wrists. There were white rings on his wrists where the metal
had been. The veins on top of his hands were engorged with blood. My
blood pressure has gone through the roof. There were Styrofoam peanuts
all over his pants. Martin handed him his soggy jacket. Styrofoam
peanuts all over the soggy jacket, too.</p>
<p>“Empty your pockets and hand me the contents,” said the Angel.</p>
<p>On the advice of Killian, Sherman hadn’t brought much with him. Four
bills, about a dollar in change, a key to the apartment, a handkerchief,
a ballpoint pen, his driver’s license—for some reason he thought he
should have identification. As he handed over each item, the Angel
described it aloud—“twenty dollars in bills,” “one silver ballpoint
pen”—and handed it to someone Sherman couldn’t see.</p>
<p>Sherman said, “Can I…keep the handkerchief?”</p>
<p>“Let me see it.”</p>
<p>Sherman held it up. His hand was shaking terribly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you can keep it. But you gotta give me the watch.”</p>
<p>“It’s only—it’s just a cheap watch,” said Sherman. He held up his
hand. The watch had a plastic case and a nylon band. “I don’t care what
happens to it.”</p>
<p>“No can do.”</p>
<p>Sherman undid the band and surrendered the little watch. A new spasm
of panic went through him.</p>
<p>“Please,” said Sherman. As soon as the word left his mouth, he knew
he shouldn’t have said it. He was begging. “How can I figure—can’t I
keep the watch?”</p>
<p>“You got an appointment or something?” The Angel attempted a smile to
show he didn’t mean it as much more than a pleasantry. But he didn’t
return the watch. Then he said, “Okay, and I need your belt and your
shoestrings.”</p>
<p>Sherman stared at him. He realized his mouth was open. He looked at
Martin. Martin was looking at the Angel. Now Martin closed his eyes and
lifted his chin, the way the Angel had, and said, “Oh boy.” (They really
do have it in for him.)</p>
<p>Sherman unbuckled the belt and pulled it out of the loops. As soon as
he did, the pants fell down around his hips. He hadn’t worn the tweed
suit in a long time, and the waist was much too big. He pulled the pants
up and stuffed his shirt back inside, and they fell down again. He had
to hold them up in front. He squatted down to take off the shoelaces.
Now he was an abject creature crouched at the feet of Martin and
Goldberg. His face was close to the Styrofoam peanuts on his pants. He
could see the crinkles on them. Some sort of horrible beetles or
parasites! The heat of his body and the woolly funk of the pants gave
off an unpleasant odor. He was aware of the humid smell of his armpits
under the clammy shirt. A total mess. No two ways about it. He had the
feeling that one of them, Martin, Goldberg, the Angel, would just step
on him, and, pop, that would be the end of that. He pulled out the
shoestrings and stood up. Standing up from the crouch made him
lightheaded. For an instant he thought he might faint. His pants were
falling down again. He pulled them up with one hand and handed the Angel
the shoestrings with the other. They were like two little dried dead
things.</p>
<p>The voice behind the desk said, “Two brown shoestrings.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Angel,” said Martin, “all yours.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said the Angel.</p>
<p>“Well, good luck, Sherman,” said Goldberg, smiling in a kindly
fashion.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said Sherman. It was horrible. He actually appreciated
it.</p>
<p>He heard a cell door slide open. Down the little corridor stood three
police officers herding a group of Latins out of one cell and into the
one next to it. Sherman recognized several of the men who had been in
line ahead of him outside.</p>
<p>“All right, knock it off, and get in there.”</p>
<p>“¡Mira! ¡Mira!”</p>
<p>One man remained in the corridor. A policeman had him by the arm. He
was tall, with a long neck, and his head lolled about. He seemed very
drunk. He was muttering to himself. Then he threw his eyes to the
heavens and screamed, “¡Mira!” He was holding up his pants the same way
Sherman was.</p>
<p>“Hey, Angel, whadda I do with this one? It’s all over his pants!” The
policeman said “pants” with great disgust.</p>
<p>“Well, shit,” said the Angel. “Take the pants off him and bury ’em,
and then wash him off, too, and give him some a those green
fatigues.”</p>
<p>“I don’t even wanna touch him, Sarge. You got any a those things they
take the cans off the shelf in the supermarket with?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I got some,” said the Angel, “and I’m gonna take your can
off.”</p>
<p>The policeman jerked the tall man back toward the first cell. The
tall man’s legs were like a marionette’s.</p>
<p>The Angel said, “Whaddaya got all over your pants?”</p>
<p>Sherman looked down. “I don’t know,” he said. “They were on the back
seat of the car.”</p>
<p>“Whose car?”</p>
<p>“Detective Martin’s car.”</p>
<p>The Angel shook his head as if now he had seen everything. “Okay,
Tanooch, take him over to Gabsie.”</p>
<p>A young white officer took Sherman by the elbow. Sherman’s hand was
holding up his pants, and so the elbow came up like a bird’s wing. His
pants were damp even in the waistband. He carried his wet jacket over
his other arm. He started walking. His right foot came out of his shoe,
because the strings were gone. He stopped, but the policeman kept
walking, jerking his elbow forward in an arc. Sherman put his foot back
in the shoe, and the policeman motioned toward the little corridor.
Sherman started shuffling, so that his feet wouldn’t come out of the
shoes. The shoes made a squishing sound because they were so wet.</p>
<p>Sherman was led toward the cubicle with the big windows. Now, just
across the corridor, he could see inside the two cells. In one there
appeared to be a dozen figures, a dozen hulks of gray and black, up
against the walls. The door to the other was open. There was only one
person inside, the tall man, slumped on a ledge. There was a brown mess
on the floor. The odor of excrement was overpowering.</p>
<p>The policeman steered Sherman into the cubicle with the windows.
Inside was a huge freckled policeman with a wide face and blond wavy
hair, who looked him up and down. The policeman called Tanooch said,
“McCoy,” and handed the big one a sheet of paper. The room seemed full
of metal stands. One looked like the sort of metal-detection gate you
see at airports. There was a camera on a tripod. There was something
that looked like a music stand except that it had nothing at the top big
enough to hold a page of music.</p>
<p>“Okay, McCoy,” said the big policeman, “step through that gate
there.”</p>
<p>Squish, squish, squish…holding his pants up with one hand and holding
his wet jacket in the other, Sherman shuffled through the gate. A loud
whining beep came from the machine.</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa,” said the policeman. “Okay, give me your coat.”</p>
<p>Sherman handed him the jacket. The man went through the pockets and
then began kneading the jacket from top to bottom. He threw the jacket
over the edge of a table.</p>
<p>“Okay, spread your feet and put your arms straight out to the side,
like this.”</p>
<p>The policeman put his arms out as if he were doing a swan dive.
Sherman stared at the policeman’s right hand. He was wearing a
translucent rubber surgical glove. It came halfway up his forearm!</p>
<p>Sherman spread his feet. When he spread his arms, his pants fell way
down. The man approached him and began patting down his arms, his chest,
his ribs, his back and then his hips and his legs. The hand with the
rubber glove created an unpleasant dry friction. A new wave of panic…He
stared at the glove in terror. The man looked at him and grunted,
apparently in amusement, and then held up his right hand. The hand and
the wrist were enormous. The hideous rubber glove was right in front of
Sherman’s face.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about the glove,” he said. “The thing is, I gotta do
your prints, and I gotta pick your fingers up one by one and put ’em on
the pad…You understand?…” His tone was conversational, neighborly, as if
there were just the two of them, out by the alley, and he was explaining
how the engine in his new Mazda worked. “I do this all day, and I get
the ink on my hands, and my skin’s rough to begin with, and sometimes I
don’t get the ink all off, and I go home, and my wife has the whole
living room done in white, and I put my hand down on the sofa or
someplace, and I get up and you can see three or four fingers on the
sofa, and my wife throws a fit.” Sherman stared at him. He didn’t know
what to say. This huge fierce-looking man wanted to be liked. It was all
so very odd. Perhaps they all wanted to be liked.</p>
<p>“Okay, walk on back through the gate.”</p>
<p>Sherman shuffled back through the gate, and the alarm went off
again.</p>
<p>“Shit,” said the man. “Try it again.”</p>
<p>The alarm went off a third time.</p>
<p>“Beats the hell outta me,” said the man. “Wait a minute. Come here.
Open your mouth.”</p>
<p>Sherman opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Keep it open…Wait a minute, turn it this way. Can’t get no light.”
He wanted to move Sherman’s head to a strange angle. Sherman could smell
the rubber of the glove. “Sonofabitch. You got a goddamn silver mine in
there. I tell you what. Bend over at the waist like this. Try to get way
down.”</p>
<p>Sherman bent over, holding up his pants with one hand. Surely he
wouldn’t—</p>
<p>“Now back through the gate, but real slow.”</p>
<p>Sherman started shuffling backward, bent over at an almost 90-degree
angle.</p>
<p>“Okay, real slow, real slow, real slow—that’s it…whoa!”</p>
<p>Sherman was now mostly through the gate. Only his shoulders and his
head remained on the other side.</p>
<p>“Okay, back up…a little farther, a little farther, little farther,
little farther…”</p>
<p>The alarm went off again.</p>
<p>“Whoa! Whoa! Right there! Stay right there!” The alarm remained
on.</p>
<p>“Sonofabitch!” said the big man. He began pacing around and sighing.
He slapped his legs with his hands. “I had one a these last year. Okay,
you can stand up.”</p>
<p>Sherman stood up. He looked at the big man, bewildered. The man stuck
his head out the door and yelled, “Hey, Tanooch! Come here! Look at
this!”</p>
<p>Across the little corridor, a policeman was in the open cell with a
hose, washing down the floor. The rush of the water echoed off the
tile.</p>
<p>“Hey, Tanooch!”</p>
<p>The policeman who had brought Sherman into the room came from down
the corridor.</p>
<p>“Look at this, Tanooch.” Then he said to Sherman, “Okay, bend over
and do that again. Back through the gate, real slow.”</p>
<p>Sherman bent over and did as he was told.</p>
<p>“Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa…Now you see that, Tanooch? So far, nothing.
Okay, now back up a little more, little more, little more…” The alarm
went off. The big man was beside himself again. He paced about and
sighed and put his hands together. “Dja see that, Tanooch! It’s his
head! Swear to Christ!…It’s the fellow’s head!…Okay, stand up. Open your
mouth…That’s it. No, turn it this way.” He moved Sherman’s head again,
to get more light. “Look in there! You wanna see some metal?”</p>
<p>The one called Tanooch said not a word to Sherman. He looked in his
mouth, like someone inspecting a crawl space in a cellar.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ,” said Tanooch. “You’re right. Set a teeth look like a
change maker.” Then he said to Sherman, as if noticing him for the first
time, “They ever let you on a airplane?”</p>
<p>The big one cracked up over this. “You’re not the only one,” he said.
“I had one like you last year. Drove me outta my mind. I couldn’t figure
out…what da fuck…you know?” Suddenly it was the casual
fellow-out-back-on-Saturday mode of conversation again. “This machine is
very sensitive, but you do have a whole head fulla metal, I gotta tell
you that.”</p>
<p>Sherman was mortified, completely humiliated. But what could he do?
Maybe these two, if he played along with them, could keep him out of…the
pens! With those people! Sherman just stood there, holding up his
pants.</p>
<p>“What’s that stuff all over your pants?” asked Tanooch.</p>
<p>“Styrofoam,” said Sherman.</p>
<p>“Styrofoam,” said Tanooch, nodding his head, but in an
uncomprehending fashion. He left the room.</p>
<p>Then the big man stood Sherman in front of a metal stand and took two
pictures of him, one from the front and one from the side. It dawned on
Sherman that this was what was known as a mug shot. This great huge bear
had just taken his mug shot, while Sherman stood there holding up his
pants. He led him over to a counter and took Sherman’s fingers one by
one and pressed them into an ink pad and then rolled them onto a printed
form. It was a surprisingly rough operation. He gripped each of
Sherman’s fingers as if he were picking up a knife or a hammer and
plunged it into the ink pad. Then he apologized.</p>
<p>“You have to do all the work yourself,” he said to Sherman. “You
can’t expect nobody comes in here to lift a goddamned finger for
you.”</p>
<p>From across the corridor came the furious sound of someone retching.
Three of the Latins were at the bars of the pen.</p>
<p>“Ayyyyyy!” yelled one of them. “The man puking! He puking
plenty!”</p>
<p>Tanooch was the first policeman there.</p>
<p>“Oh, f’r Chrissake. Oh, beautiful. Hey, Angel! This guy’s a one-man
garbage barge. Whaddaya wanna do?”</p>
<p>“He the same one?” said the Angel.</p>
<p>Then the smell of vomit began to spread.</p>
<p>“Ayyyyyyyy, whaddaya whaddaya,” said the Angel. “Hose it down and
leave ’im in there.”</p>
<p>They opened the bars, and two policemen stood by outside while a
third went inside with the hose. The prisoners hopped this way and that,
to keep from getting wet.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sarge,” said the policeman. “Guy puked all over his pants.”</p>
<p>“The fatigues?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Fuck it. Hose ’em down. This ain’t a laundry.”</p>
<p>Sherman could see the tall man sitting on the ledge with his head
down. His knees were covered in vomit, and his elbows were on his
knees.</p>
<p>The big man was watching all this through the window of the
fingerprint room. He was shaking his head. Sherman went up to him.</p>
<p>“Look, Officer, isn’t there some other place I can wait? I can’t go
in there. I’m—I just can’t do it.”</p>
<p>The big man stuck his head out of the fingerprint room and yelled,
“Hey, Angel, whaddaya wanna do with my man here, McCoy?”</p>
<p>The Angel looked over from his desk and stared at Sherman and rubbed
his hand over his bald head.</p>
<p>“Welllll…” Then he motioned with his hand toward the cell. “That’s
it.”</p>
<p>Tanooch came in and took Sherman by the arm again. Someone opened up
the bars. Tanooch steered Sherman inside, and he went shuffling onto the
tile floor, holding up his pants. The bars shut behind him. Sherman
stared at the Latins, who were sitting on the ledge. They stared back,
all but the tall one, who still had his head down, rolling his elbows in
the vomit on his knees.</p>
<p>The entire floor slanted in toward the drain in the middle. It was
still wet. Sherman could feel the slant now that he was standing on it.
A few driblets of water were still rolling down the drain. That was it.
It was a drainpipe, where mankind sought its own level, and the meat
spigot was on.</p>
<p>He heard the bars slide shut behind him, and he stood there in the
cell holding his pants up with his right hand. He cradled his jacket
with his left arm. He didn’t know what to do or even where to look, and
so he picked out an empty space on the wall and tried to take a look
at…them…with peripheral vision. Their clothes were a blur of gray and
black and brown, except for their sneakers, which created a pattern of
stripes and swashes along the floor. He knew they were watching him. He
glanced toward the bars. Not a single policeman! Would they even move a
muscle if anything…</p>
<p>The Latinos had taken every seat on the ledge. He chose a spot about
four feet from the end of the ledge and leaned his back up against the
wall. The wall hurt his spine. He lifted his right foot, and his shoe
fell off. He slipped his foot back into it as casually as he could.
Looking down at his foot on the bright tile made him feel as if he was
going to keel over with vertigo. The Styrofoam peanuts! They were still
all over his pants legs.</p>
<p>He was seized with the terrible fear that they would take him to be a
lunatic, the sort of hopeless case they could slaughter at their
leisure. He was aware of the smell of vomit…vomit and cigarette smoke…He
lowered his head, as if he were dozing, and cut his eyes toward them.
They were staring at him! They were staring at him and smoking their
cigarettes. The tall one, the one who had kept saying, “¡Mira! ¡Mira!”
still sat on the ledge with his head down and his elbows on his knees,
which were covered in vomit.</p>
<p>One of the Latinos was rising up from the ledge and walking toward
him! He could see him out of the corner of his eye. Now it was starting!
They weren’t even waiting!</p>
<p>The man was settling up against the wall, right next to him, leaning
back the same way Sherman was. He had thin curly hair, a mustache that
curved down around his lips, a slightly yellowish complexion, narrow
shoulders, a little potbelly, and a crazy look in his eyes. He must have
been about thirty-five. He smiled, and that made him look crazier
still.</p>
<p>“Hey, man, I see you outside.”</p>
<p>See me outside!</p>
<p>“With the TV, man. Why you here?”</p>
<p>“Reckless endangerment,” said Sherman. He felt as if he were croaking
out his last words on this earth.</p>
<p>“Reckless endangerment?”</p>
<p>“That’s…hitting somebody with your car.”</p>
<p>“With you car? You hit somebody with you car, and the TV come
here?”</p>
<p>Sherman shrugged. He didn’t want to say anything more, but his fear
of appearing aloof got the better of him.</p>
<p>“What are you here for?”</p>
<p>“Oh, man, 220, 265, 225.” The fellow threw his hand out, as if to
take in the entire world. “Drugs, handguns, gambling
paraphernalia—ayyyyyy, every piece a bullshit, you know?”</p>
<p>The man seemed to take a certain pride in this calamity.</p>
<p>“You hit somebody with you car?” he asked once more. He apparently
found this trivial and unmanly. Sherman raised his eyebrows and nodded
wearily.</p>
<p>The man returned to the seating ledge, and Sherman could see him
talking to three or four of his comrades, who looked at Sherman once
more and then looked away, as if bored by the news. Sherman had the
feeling that he had let them down. Very odd! And yet that was what he
felt.</p>
<p>Sherman’s fear was rapidly supplanted by tedium. The minutes crawled
by. His left hip joint began to hurt. He shifted his weight to the
right, and his back hurt. Then his right hip joint hurt. The floor was
tile. The walls were tile. He rolled up his jacket to create a cushion.
He put it on the floor, next to the wall, and sat down and leaned back.
The jacket was damp, and so were his pants. His bladder was beginning to
fill, and he could feel little knives of gas in his bowels.</p>
<p>The little man who had come over to talk to him, the little man who
knew the numbers, walked to the bars. He had a cigarette in his mouth.
He took the cigarette out, and he yelled, “Ayyyyyy! I need a light!” No
response from the policeman beyond. “Ayyyyyy, I need a light!”</p>
<p>Finally, the one called Tanooch came up. “What’s your problem?”</p>
<p>“Ayyy, I need a light.” He held up his cigarette.</p>
<p>Tanooch dug a book of matches out of his pocket and lit one and held
it about four feet away from the bars. The little man waited, then put
the cigarette between his lips and pressed his face against the bars so
that the cigarette protruded outside. Tanooch was motionless, holding
the burning match. The match went out.</p>
<p>“Ayyyyyy!” said the little man.</p>
<p>Tanooch shrugged and let the match fall to the floor.</p>
<p>“Ayyyyyy!” The little man turned around toward his comrades and held
the cigarette up in the air. (See what he did?) One of the men sitting
on the ledge laughed. The little man made a face at this betrayal of
sympathies. Then he looked at Sherman. Sherman didn’t know whether to
commiserate or look the other way. He ended up just staring. The man
walked over and squatted down beside him. The unlit cigarette was
hanging out of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Dja see that?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Sherman.</p>
<p>“You wanna light, they suppose a give you a light. Son a mabitch.
Ayyy…you got cigarettes?”</p>
<p>“No, they took everything away from me. Even my shoestrings.”</p>
<p>“No shit?” He looked at Sherman’s shoes. He himself still had on
shoelaces, Sherman noticed.</p>
<p>Sherman could hear a woman’s voice. She was angry about something.
She appeared in the little corridor outside the cell. Tanooch was
leading her. She was a tall thin woman with curly brown hair and dark
tan skin, wearing black pants and an odd-looking jacket with very big
shoulders. Tanooch was escorting her toward the fingerprint room. All at
once she wheeled about and said to someone Sherman couldn’t see, “You
big bag a…” She didn’t complete the phrase. “Least I don’t sit in ’is
sewer here all day long, way you do! Think about it, fat boy!”</p>
<p>Much derisive laughter from the policemen in the background.</p>
<p>“Watch it or he’ll flush you down, Mabel.”</p>
<p>Tanooch prodded her on. “C’mon, Mabel.”</p>
<p>She turned on Tanooch. “You talk to me, you call me by my right name!
You don’t call me Mabel!”</p>
<p>Tanooch said, “I’ll call you worse’n that in a minute,” and he kept
pushing her on toward the fingerprint room.</p>
<p>“Two-twenty-thirty-one,” said the little man. “Selling drugs.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?” asked Sherman.</p>
<p>The little man just opened his eyes wide and put a knowing look on
his face. (Some things go without saying.) Then he shook his head and
said, “Focking bus come in.”</p>
<p>“Bus?”</p>
<p>It seemed that ordinarily, when people were arrested, they were taken
first to a precinct station house and locked up. Periodically a police
van made the rounds of the precincts and transported the prisoners to
Central Booking for fingerprinting and arraignment. So now a new lot had
arrived. They would all end up in this pen, except for the women, who
were taken to another pen, down the corridor and around a bend. And
nothing was moving, because “Albany was down.”</p>
<p>Three more women went by. They were younger than the first one.</p>
<p>“Two-thirty,” said the little man. “Prostitutes.”</p>
<p>The little man who knew the numbers was right. The bus had come in.
The procession began, from the Angel’s desk to the fingerprinting room
to the cell. Sherman’s pang of fear began to heat up all over again. One
by one, three tall black youths with shaved heads, windbreakers, and big
white sneakers came into the cell. All of the new arrivals were black or
Latin. Most were young. Several appeared to be drunk. The little man who
knew the numbers got up and went back to join his comrades and secure
his place on the ledge. Sherman was determined not to move. He wanted to
be invisible. Somehow…so long as he didn’t move a muscle…they wouldn’t
see him.</p>
<p>Sherman stared at the floor and tried not to think about his aching
bowels and bladder. One of the black lines between the tiles on the
floor began to move. A cockroach! Then he saw another…and a third.
Fascinating!—and horrible. Sherman glanced about to see if anyone else
noticed. No one seemed to—but he caught the eye of one of the three
black youths. All three were staring at him! Such thin hard malevolent
faces! His heart immediately kicked into tachycardia. He could see his
foot jerk with the force of his heartbeat pulse. He stared at the
cockroaches to try to cool himself down. A cockroach had made its way
over to the drunken Latino, who had slumped to the floor. The cockroach
began ascending the heel of his shoe. It began walking up his leg. It
disappeared up his pant leg. Then it reappeared. It climbed the cuff of
his pants. It began climbing toward his knee. When it reached the knee,
it settled in amid the cakes of vomit.</p>
<p>Sherman looked up. One of the black youths was heading toward him. He
had a little smile on his face. He seemed tremendously tall. His eyes
were set close together. He wore black pants with stovepipe legs and big
white sneakers that closed in front with Velcro straps rather than
shoelaces. He stooped down in front of Sherman. His face had no
expression at all. All the more terrifying! He looked right into
Sherman’s face.</p>
<p>“Hey, man, you got a cigarette?”</p>
<p>Sherman said, “No.” But he didn’t want him to think he was acting
tough or even uncommunicative, and so he added, “Sorry. They took
everything away from me.”</p>
<p>As soon as he said it, he knew it was a mistake. It was an apology, a
signal that he was weak.</p>
<p>“That’s okay, man.” The youth sounded halfway friendly. “What you in
for?”</p>
<p>Sherman hesitated. “Manslaughter,” he said. “Reckless endangerment”
just wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>“Yeah. That’s bad,” said the youth in an approximation of a concerned
voice. “What happened?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said Sherman. “I don’t know what they’re talking about.
What are you here for?”</p>
<p>“A 160–15,” said the youth. Then he added, “Armed robbery.”</p>
<p>The youth screwed up his lips. Sherman couldn’t tell whether that was
supposed to say, “Armed robbery is nothing special,” or, “It’s a
bullshit charge.”</p>
<p>The youth smiled at Sherman, still looking directly into his face.
“Okay, Mr. Manslaughter,” he said, and he stood up and turned about and
walked back to the other side of the cell.</p>
<p>Mr. Manslaughter! Immediately he knew he could treat me cavalierly!
What could they do? Surely they couldn’t…There had been an
incident—where?—in which some of the prisoners in a cell blocked the
view through the bars with their bodies while the others…But would any
of the others in here do such a thing for these three—would the
Latinos?</p>
<p>Sherman’s mouth was dry, absolutely parched. The urge to urinate was
acute. His heart beat nervously, although not as rapidly as before. At
that moment, the bars slid open. More policemen. One of them carried two
cardboard trays, the sort delicatessens use. He set them down on the
floor of the cell. On one was a mound of sandwiches; on the other, rows
of plastic cups.</p>
<p>He stood up and said, “Okay, chow time. Share and share alike, and I
don’t wanna hear any bullshit.”</p>
<p>There was no rush toward the food. All the same, Sherman was glad he
was not too far away from the two trays. He tucked his filthy jacket
under his left arm and shuffled over and picked up a sandwich wrapped in
Saran Wrap and a plastic cup containing a clear pinkish liquid. Then he
sat down on his coat again and tried the drink. It had a weak sugary
taste. He put the plastic cup on the floor beside him and pulled the
wrap off the sandwich. He pulled the two pieces of bread apart and
peeked inside. There was a slice of lunch meat. It was a sickly
yellowish color. In the fluorescent light of the cell it looked almost
chartreuse. It had a smooth clammy surface. He raised the sandwich
toward his face and sniffed. A dead chemical smell came from the meat.
He separated the two pieces of bread and pulled out the piece of meat
and wrapped it up in the Saran Wrap and put the crumpled mess on the
floor. He would eat the bread by itself. But the bread gave off such an
unpleasant smell from the meat he couldn’t stand it. Laboriously, he
unfolded the Saran Wrap and rolled up the bread into balls and wrapped
up the whole mess, the meat and the bread. He was aware of someone
standing in front of him. White sneakers with Velcro straps.</p>
<p>He looked up. The black youth was looking down at him with a curious
little smile. He sank down on his haunches, until his head was only
slightly above Sherman’s.</p>
<p>“Hey, man,” he said. “I’m kinda thirsty. Gimme your drink.”</p>
<p>Gimme your drink! Sherman nodded toward the cardboard trays.</p>
<p>“Ain’t none left, man. Gimme yours.”</p>
<p>Sherman ransacked his mind for something to say. He shook his
head.</p>
<p>“You heard the man. Share and share alike. Thought me and you’s
buddies.”</p>
<p>Such a contemptuous tone of mock disappointment! Sherman knew it was
time to draw a line, stop this…this…Quicker than Sherman’s eye could
follow it, the youth’s arm shot out and seized the plastic cup on the
floor beside Sherman. He stood up and threw back his head and
ostentatiously drained the drink and held the cup over Sherman and
said:</p>
<p>“I asked you politely…You understand?…In here, you gotta use your
head and make friends.”</p>
<p>Then he opened his hand, let the cup fall down onto Sherman’s lap,
and walked away. Sherman was aware the entire room was watching. I
should—I should—but he was paralyzed with fear and confusion. Across the
way, a Latino was pulling the meat out of his sandwich and throwing it
on the floor. There were slices of meat everywhere. Here and there were
balled-up wads of Saran Wrap and entire sandwiches, unwrapped and thrown
on the floor. The Latino had begun to eat the bread by itself—and his
eyes were on Sherman. They were looking at him…in this human pen…yellow
lunch meat, bread, Saran Wrap, plastic cups…cockroaches! Here…over
there…He looked toward the drunken Latino. He was still collapsed on the
floor. There were three cockroaches rooting about in the folds of his
left pant leg at the knee. All at once Sherman saw something moving at
the mouth of the man’s pant pocket. Another roach—no, much too
big…gray…a mouse!…a mouse crawling out of the man’s pocket…The mouse
clung to the cloth for a moment, then scampered down to the tile floor
and stopped again. Then it darted forward and reached a piece of yellow
lunch meat. It stopped again, as if sizing up this bonanza…</p>
<p>“¡Mira!” One of the Latinos had seen the mouse.</p>
<p>A foot came flying out from the ledge. The mouse went skidding across
the tile floor like a hockey puck. Another leg flew out. The mouse went
flying back toward the ledge…A laugh, a cackle…“¡Mira!”…another foot…The
mouse went skidding on its back, over a wad of lunch meat, which spun it
upright again…Laughter, shouts…“¡Mira! ¡Mira!”…another kick…The mouse
came spinning toward Sherman, on its back. It was just lying there, two
or three inches from his foot, dazed, its legs jerking. Then it
struggled to its feet, barely moving. The little rodent was out of it,
finished. Not even fear was enough to get it moving. It lurched forward
a couple of steps…More laughter…Should I kick it as a sign of my
solidarity with my cellmates?…That was what he wondered…Without
thinking, he stood up. He reached down and picked up the mouse. He held
it in his right hand and walked toward the bars. The cell grew silent.
The mouse twitched feebly in his palm. He had almost reached the
bars…Sonofabitch!…A tremendous pain in his index finger…The mouse had
bitten him!…Sherman jumped and jerked his hand up. The mouse held on to
his finger with its jaws. Sherman flailed his finger up and down as if
he were shaking down a thermometer. The little beast wouldn’t let
go!…“¡Mira! ¡Mira!”…cackles, laughter…It was a terrific show! They were
enjoying it immensely! Sherman banged the meaty side of his hand down on
one of the crosspieces of the bars. The mouse went flying off…right in
front of Tanooch, who had a sheaf of papers in his hand and was
approaching the cell. Tanooch jumped back.</p>
<p>“Holy shit!” he said. Then he glowered at Sherman. “You gone off the
platter?”</p>
<p>The mouse was lying on the floor. Tanooch stamped on it with the heel
of his shoe. The animal lay flattened on the floor with its mouth
open.</p>
<p>Sherman’s hand hurt terribly, from where he had hit the bar. He
cradled it with his other hand. I’ve broken it! He could see the teeth
marks of the mouse on his index finger and a single tiny blob of blood.
With his left hand, he reached around behind his back and pulled the
handkerchief out of his right hip pocket. It required a tremendous
contortion. They were all watching. Oh, yes…all watching. He swabbed the
blood and wrapped the handkerchief around his hand. He heard Tanooch say
to another policeman:</p>
<p>“The guy from Park Avenue. He threw a mouse.”</p>
<p>Sherman shuffled back toward where his jacket was balled up on the
floor. He sat back down on the coat. His hand didn’t hurt nearly so much
any longer. Maybe I haven’t broken it. But my finger may be poisoned
from the bite! He pulled the handkerchief back far enough to look at the
finger. It didn’t look so bad. The blob of blood was gone.</p>
<p>The black youth was coming toward him again! Sherman looked up at him
and then looked away. The fellow sat on his haunches in front of him, as
before.</p>
<p>“Hey, man,” he said, “you know something? I’m cold.”</p>
<p>Sherman tried to ignore him. He turned his head. He was conscious of
having a petulant look on his face. The wrong expression! Weak!</p>
<p>“Yo! Look at me when I’m talking to you!”</p>
<p>Sherman turned his head toward him. Pure malevolence!</p>
<p>“I ask you for a drink, and you wasn’t nice, but I’m going to give
you a chance to make up for that…see…I’m feeling cold, man. I want your
coat. Gimme your coat.”</p>
<p>My coat! My clothes!</p>
<p>Sherman’s mind raced. He couldn’t speak. He shook his head no.</p>
<p>“What’sa matter with you, man? You oughta try and be friendly,
Mr. Manslaughter. My buddy, he say he know you. He saw you on TV. You
wasted some ace, and you live on Park Avenue. That’s nice, man. But this
ain’t Park Avenue. You understand? You best be making some friends, you
understand? You been slicking me some kinda bad, bad, bad, but I’m gonna
give you a chance to make up for it. New gimme the fucking coat.”</p>
<p>Sherman stopped thinking. His brain was on fire! He put his hands
flat on the floor and lifted his hips and then rocked forward until he
was on one knee. Then he jumped up, clutching the jacket in his right
hand. He did it so suddenly the black youth was startled.</p>
<p>“Shut up!” he heard himself saying. “You and I got nothing to talk
about!”</p>
<p>The black youth stared at him blankly. Then he smiled. “Shut up?” he
said. “Shut up!” He grinned and made a snorting noise. “Shut me up.”</p>
<p>“Hey! You germs! Knock it off!” It was Tanooch at the bars. He was
looking at the two of them. The black youth gave Sherman a big smile and
stuck his tongue in his cheek. (Enjoy yourself! You’re gonna own your
mortal hide for about sixty seconds longer!) He walked back to the ledge
and sat down, staring at Sherman the whole time.</p>
<p>Tanooch read from a sheet of paper: “Solinas! Gutiérrez! McCoy!”</p>
<p>McCoy! Sherman hurriedly put on the jacket, lest his nemesis rush
forward and snatch it before he could leave the cell. The jacket was
wet, greasy, fetid, completely shapeless. His pants fell down around his
hips as he put it on. There were Styrofoam peanuts all over the coat
and…moving!…two cockroaches had crawled into the folds. Frantically he
swept them off onto the floor. He was still breathing rapidly and
loudly.</p>
<p>As Sherman filed out of the cell behind the Latinos, Tanooch said to
him in a low voice, “See? We didn’t forget you. Your name’s actually
about six more down the list.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Sherman. “I appreciate that.”</p>
<p>Tanooch shrugged. “I’d rather walk you outta there than sweep you
outta there.”</p>
<p>The main room was now full of policemen and prisoners. At the desk,
the Angel’s desk, Sherman was turned over to a Department of Corrections
officer, who manacled his hands behind his back and put him in a line
with the Latinos. His pants now fell hopelessly around his hips. There
was no way he could pull them up. He kept looking over his shoulder,
fearful that the black youth might be right behind him. He was the last
person in the little line. The Corrections officers led them up a narrow
stairway. At the top of the stairs was another windowless room. More
Corrections officers sat at some beat-up metal desks. Beyond the
desks—more cells! They were smaller, grayer, dingier than the white-tile
cells downstairs. Real jail cells, they were. On the first was a peeling
sign that said, MEN ONLY—21 AND OVER—8 TO 10 CAP. The 21 AND OVER had
been crossed out with some sort of marker. The entire line of prisoners
was led into the cell. The handcuffs were left on. Sherman kept his eyes
pinned on the doorway they had first entered. If the black youth came in
and was put into this small cell with him—he—he—his fear made him crazy.
He was sweating profusely. He had lost all track of time. He hung his
head down to try to improve his circulation.</p>
<p>Presently they were led out of the cell and toward a door made of
steel bars. On the other side of the door Sherman could see a line of
prisoners sitting on the floor of a corridor. The corridor was scarcely
thirty-six inches wide. One of the prisoners was a young white man with
an enormous cast on his right leg. He wore shorts, so that the entire
cast was visible. He was sitting on the floor. A pair of crutches leaned
against the wall beside him. At the far end of the corridor was a door.
An officer stood beside it. He had a huge revolver on his hip. It
occurred to Sherman that this was the first gun he had seen since he
entered this place. As each prisoner left the detention area and went
through the gate, his handcuffs were removed. Sherman slumped against
the wall, like all the rest. The corridor was airless. There were no
windows. It was filled with a fluorescent haze and the heat and stench
of too many bodies. The meat spigot! The chute to the abattoir!
Going…where?</p>
<p>The door at the end of the corridor opened, and a voice from the
other side said, “Lander.” The Corrections officer inside the corridor
said, “Okay, Lander.” The young man with the crutches struggled to his
feet. The Latino next to him gave him a hand. He bounced on his good
foot until he could get the crutches settled under his armpits. What on
earth could he have done in that condition? The policeman opened the
door for him, and Sherman could hear a voice on the other side calling
out some numbers and then, “Herbert Lander?…counsel representing Herbert
Lander?”</p>
<p>The courtroom! At the end of the chute was the courtroom!</p>
<p>By the time Sherman’s turn came, he felt dazed, groggy, feverish. The
voice from the other side said, “Sherman McCoy.” The policeman inside
said, “McCoy.” Sherman shuffled through the door, holding his pants up,
sliding his feet so as to keep his shoes on. He was aware of a bright
modern room and a great many people going this way and that. The judge’s
bench, the desks, the seats, were all made of a cheap-looking blond
wood. To one side people moved in waves around the judge’s elevated
blond-wood perch, and on the other side they moved in waves in what
appeared to be a spectators’ section. So many people…such a bright
light…such confusion…such a commotion…Between the two sections was a
fence, also of blond wood. And at the fence stood Killian…He was there!
He looked very fresh and dapper in his fancy clothes. He was smiling. It
was the reassuring smile you save for invalids. As Sherman shuffled
toward him, he became acutely aware of what he himself must look
like…the filthy sodden jacket and pants…the Styrofoam peanuts…the
wrinkled shirt, the wet shoes with no strings…He could smell his own
funk of filth, despair, and terror.</p>
<p>Someone was reading out some number, and then he heard his name, and
then he heard Killian saying his own name, and the judge said, “How do
you plead?” Killian said to Sherman, sotto voce, “Say, ‘Not guilty.’”
Sherman croaked out the words.</p>
<p>There seemed to be a great deal of commotion in the room. The press?
How long had he been in this place? Then an argument broke out. There
was an intense heavyset balding young man in front of the judge. He
seemed to be from the District Attorney’s Office. The judge said buzz
buzz buzz buzz Mr. Kramer. Mr. Kramer.</p>
<p>To Sherman, the judge seemed very young. He was a chubby white man
with receding curly hair and a set of robes that looked as if they had
been rented for a graduation.</p>
<p>Sherman heard Killian mutter, “Sonofabitch.”</p>
<p>Kramer was saying, “I realize, Your Honor, that our office agreed to
bail of only 0,000 in this case. But subsequent developments, matters
that have come to our attention since that time, make it impossible for
our office to agree to such a low bail. Your Honor, this case involves a
serious injury, very possibly a fatal injury, and we have definite and
specific knowledge that there was a witness in this case who has not
come forward and that that witness was actually in the car driven by the
defendant, Mr. McCoy, and we have every reason to believe that attempts
have been or will be made to prevent that witness from coming forth, and
we do not believe it will serve the interests of justice—”</p>
<p>Killian said, “Your Honor—”</p>
<p>“—to allow this defendant to go free on a token bail—”</p>
<p>A rumble, a growl, an immense angry mutter rose from the spectators’
section, and a single deep voice shouted: “No bail!” Then a mighty
mutterers’ chorus: “No bail!”…“Lock ’im up!”…“Bang it shut!”</p>
<p>The judge rapped his gavel. The muttering died down.</p>
<p>Killian said, “Your Honor, Mr. Kramer knows very well—”</p>
<p>The rumble rose again.</p>
<p>Kramer plowed on, right over Killian’s words: “Given the emotions in
this community, quite justifiably aroused by this case, in which it has
appeared that justice is a reed—”</p>
<p>Killian on the counterattack, shouting: “Your Honor, this is patent
nonsense!”</p>
<p>A mighty rumble.</p>
<p>The rumble erupted into a roar; the muttering into a great raw yawp.
“Awww, man!”…“Booooo!”…“Yeggggh!”…“Shut your filthy mouth and let the
man talk!”</p>
<p>The judge banged the gavel again. “Quiet!” The roar subsided. Then to
Killian: “Let him finish his statement. You can respond.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Your Honor,” said Kramer. “Your Honor, I would call the
court’s attention to the fact that this case, even in the arraignment
stage, on very short notice, has brought out a heavy representation of
the community and most specifically of the friends and neighbors of the
victim in this case, Henry Lamb, who remains in extremely grave
condition in the hospital.”</p>
<p>Kramer turned and motioned toward the spectators’ section. It was
packed. There were people standing. Sherman noticed a group of black men
in blue work shirts. One of them was very tall and wore a gold
earring.</p>
<p>“I have a petition,” said Kramer, and he lifted some sheets of paper
and waved them over his head. “This document has been signed by more
than a hundred members of the community and delivered to the Bronx
District Attorney’s Office with an appeal that our office be their
representative, to see that justice is done in this case, and of course
it is no more than our sworn duty to be their representative.”</p>
<p>“Jesus H. Christ,” muttered Killian.</p>
<p>“The neighborhood, the community, the people of the Bronx, intend to
watch this case, diligently, every step of the judicial process.”</p>
<p>Right!…Yegggh!…Un-hunnnnh!…Tell ’im! A terrific yammering started in
the spectators’ section.</p>
<p>The chubby judge rapped his gavel and called out, “Quiet! This is an
arraignment. It’s not a rally. Is that all, Mr. Kramer?”</p>
<p>Rumble rumble mutter mutter booooo!</p>
<p>“Your Honor,” said Kramer, “I have been instructed by my office, by
Mr. Weiss himself, to request bail in the amount of 50,000 in this
case.”</p>
<p>Right!…Yegggh!…Tell ’im!…Cheers, applause, stamping on the floor.</p>
<p>Sherman looked at Killian. Tell me—tell me—tell me this cant possibly
happen! But Killian was straining toward the judge. He had his hand in
the air. His lips were already moving. The judge was banging the
gavel.</p>
<p>“Any more of this and I’ll clear the room!”</p>
<p>“Your Honor,” said Killian, as the din subsided, “Mr. Kramer is not
content to violate an agreement between his office and my client. He
wants a circus! This morning my client was subjected to a circus arrest,
despite the fact that he has been ready at all times to testify
voluntarily before a grand jury. And now Mr. Kramer manufactures a
fictitious threat to an unnamed witness and asks the court to set a
preposterous bail. My client is a homeowner of long standing in this
city, he has a family and deep roots in his community, and a bail
request has been agreed to, as even Mr. Kramer acknowledges, and nothing
has occurred to alter the premise of that agreement.”</p>
<p>“A lot has changed, Your Honor!” said Kramer.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Killian, “the Office of the Bronx District Attorney is
what’s changed!”</p>
<p>“All right!” said the judge. “Mr. Kramer, if your office has
information bearing upon the bail status of this case, I instruct you to
gather that information and make a formal application to this court, and
the matter will be reviewed at that time. Until then, the court is
releasing the defendant, Sherman McCoy, under a bond in the amount of
0,000, pending presentation of this complaint to the grand jury.”</p>
<p>Bellows and screams! Boooo!…Yegggghh!…Noooooo!…Ged’iml…And then a
chant began: “No bail—put ’im in jail!”…“No bail—put ’im in jail!”</p>
<p>Killian was leading him away from the bench. To get out of the
courtroom they would have to go straight through the spectators’
section, straight through a mass of angry people who were now on their
feet. Sherman could see fists in the air. Then he saw policemen coming
toward him, half a dozen at least. They wore white shirts and bullet
belts and colossal holsters with pistol handles showing. In fact, they
were court officers. They closed in around him. They’re putting me back
in the cell! Then he realized they were forming a flying wedge to get
him through the crowd. So many glowering faces, black and white!
Murderer!…Motherfucker!…You gonna get what Henry Lamb got!…Say your
prayers, Park Avenue!…Tear you a new one!… McCoy, say—McDead, baby!…He
stumbled on, between his white-shirted protectors. He could hear them
groaning and straining as they pushed back the crowd. “Coming through!
Coming through!”…Here and there other faces popped up, lips moving…The
tall Englishman with the blond hair…Fallow…The press…then more
shouts…You mine, Needlenose! Mine!…Count every breath,
baby!…Geed’um!…Lights out, sucker!…Look at ’im—Park Avenue!</p>
<p>Even in the midst of the storm, Sherman felt strangely unmoved by
what was happening. His thoughts told him it was something dreadful, but
he didn’t feel it. Since I’m already dead.</p>
<p>The storm burst out of the courtroom and into a lobby. The lobby was
full of people standing about. Sherman could see their expressions
change from consternation to fear. They began scurrying to the sides, to
make way for the rogue galaxy of bodies that had just burst out of the
courtroom. Now Killian and the court officers were steering him onto an
escalator. There was a hideous mural on the wall. The escalator was
heading down. Pressure from behind—he pitched forward, landing on the
back of a court officer on the step below. For a moment it seemed as if
an avalanche of bodies—but the court officer caught himself on the
rolling railings. Now the screaming galaxy burst through the front doors
and out onto the main stairway on 161st Street. A wall of bodies was in
the way. Television cameras, six or eight of them, microphones, fifteen
or twenty of them, screaming people—the press.</p>
<p>The two masses of humanity met, merged, froze. Killian rose up in
front of Sherman. Microphones were in his face, and Killian was
declaiming, most oratorically:</p>
<p>“I want you to show the whole city a New York”—Yawk—“what you just
saw”—sawwwwr—“in there”—in eh. With the most curious detachment Sherman
found himself aware of every street inflection of the fop’s voice. “You
saw a circus arrest, and then you saw a circus arraignment, and then you
saw the District Attorney’s Office prostituting itself and perverting
the law”—the lawwr—“for your cameras and for the approval of a partisan
mob!”</p>
<p>Booooo!…Yegggh!…Partisan you, you bent-nose bastard!…Somewhere behind
him, no more than twenty-four inches away, someone was keening in a
singsong falsetto: “Say your prayers, McCoy…Your day is done…Say your
prayers, McCoy…Your day is done…”</p>
<p>Killian said: “We reached an agreement with the district attorney
yesterday…”</p>
<p>The singsong falsetto said: “Say your prayers, McCoy…Count your
breaths…”</p>
<p>Sherman looked up at the sky. The rain had stopped. The sun had
broken through. It was a lovely balmy day in June. There was a fluffy
blue dome over the Bronx.</p>
<p>He looked at the sky and listened to the sounds, just the sounds, the
orotund tropes and sententiae, the falsetto songs, the inquisitory
shouts, the hippo mutterings, and he thought: I’m not going back in
there, ever. I don’t care what it takes to keep me out, even if I have
to stick a shotgun in my mouth.</p>
<p>The only shotgun he had was, in fact, double-barreled. It was a big
old thing. He stood on 161st Street, a block from the Grand Concourse,
in the Bronx, and wondered if he could get both barrels in his
mouth.</p>
