<h4 id="the-informants">24. The Informants</h4>
<p>The dreadful orange carpet blazed away. Right next to the Formica
couch he was slouched upon, it had come loose from the floor where it
abutted the wall, and the crinkly metallic fibers frayed out. Sherman
stared at the itchy sleaze of it as a way of averting his eyes from the
sinister figures on the couch opposite him. He was afraid they would be
staring at him and would know who he was. The fact that Killian would
make him wait like this sealed it, nailed down the correctness of what
he was about to do. This would be his last visit to this place, his last
descent into the vulgarity of Favor Banks, contracts, lower-crust fops,
and cheap gutter philosophies.</p>
<p>But soon curiosity got the better of him, and he looked at their
feet…Two men…One had on a dainty little pair of slip-on shoes with
decorative gold chains running across the top. The other wore a pair of
snow-white Reebok sneakers. The shoes shuffled a bit as the two men’s
tails slid down the couch and they pushed themselves back up with their
legs and then slid down again and pushed back and slid down and pushed
back. Sherman slid down and pushed back. They slid down and pushed back.
Sherman slid down and pushed back. Everything about the place, even the
obscene downslope of the couches, proclaimed tastelessness,
shiftlessness, vulgarity, and, at bottom, sheer ignorance. The two men
were talking in what Sherman took to be Spanish. “Oy el meemo,” one of
them kept saying, “Oy el meemo.” He let his eyes creep up as far as
their midsections. Both had on knit shirts and leather jackets; more
Leather People. “Oy el meemo.” He took the big chance: their faces.
Immediately he cast his eyes down again. They were staring right at him!
Such cruel looks! Both appeared to be in their early thirties. They had
thick black hair coiffed and trimmed, just so, in vulgar but probably
expensive hairdos. Both had their hair parted down the center and teased
in such a way that the hair seemed to be gushing up in neat black
ceremonial fountains. Such twisted expressions as they stared at him!
Did they know?</p>
<p>Now he could hear Killian’s voice. Tawk. Lawr. Awright. He consoled
himself with the thought that he wouldn’t have to listen to it much
longer. The Lion was right. How could he have entrusted his fate to
anyone immersed in this sordid milieu? Killian appeared at the doorway
from the inner hall. He had his arm around the shoulders of a pudgy and
thoroughly dejected little white man who wore a pathetic suit with an
especially pathetic vest that popped out in front of his belly.</p>
<p>“What can I tell you, Donald?” Killian was saying. “The law’s like
anything else. You get what you pay for. All right?” The lawr’s like
anything else. Yuh gedwudja pay for. The little man trudged off without
even looking at him. Not once had he been in Killian’s presence when the
main topic of conversation had not been money—the money due Thomas
Killian.</p>
<p>“Ayyyyyy,” said Killian, smiling at Sherman, “I didn’t mean for you
to have to wait.” He cast his eyes significantly at the retreating
figure of the little man, then shrugged his eyebrows.</p>
<p>As he and Sherman walked down the hallway, beneath the blazing
downlighters, to Killian’s office, he said, “Now that”—his head nodded
back in the general direction of the little man—“is a guy with problems.
A fifty-seven-year-old assistant principal, Irish Catholic, wife and
family, and he gets picked up on a charge of propositioning a
seven-year-old girl. The arresting officer claims he offered her a
banana and went on from there.”</p>
<p>Sherman said nothing. Did this insensitive wiseguy fop, with his
incessant cynicism, actually think that would make him feel better? A
chill went through him. It was as if the pudgy little man’s fate were
his own.</p>
<p>“You check out the two guys across from you?”</p>
<p>Sherman braced. Which hell were they trapped in?</p>
<p>“Twenty-eight, twenty-nine years old, both of them, and they’d be on
the Forbes Four Hundred list if their business published annual reports.
They got that much money. They’re Cubans, but they import from Colombia.
They’re Mike Bellavita’s clients.”</p>
<p>Sherman’s resentment grew with each wiseguy word. Did the fop really
think his breezy survey of the local scene, his detachment, his
hard-boiled tone would flatter him, would make him feel superior to the
detritus caught in the filthy tide that flows through here? I’m not
superior, you oh-so-knowing, oh-so-ignorant fool! I’m one of them! My
heart goes out to them! An old Irish child molester…two young Cuban drug
dealers with their sad pompous hair—in short, he was learning for
himself the truth of the saying “A liberal is a conservative who has
been arrested.”</p>
<p>In Killian’s office, Sherman took a seat and watched the Irish fop
rear back in his desk chair and roll his shoulders about under his
double-breasted suit, preening. He resented him even more profoundly.
Killian was in excellent spirits. Newspapers were stacked up on his
desk. Team Mercedes: He Hit, She Ran. But of course! The hottest
criminal case in New York was his.</p>
<p>Well, he was about to lose it. How should he tell him? He wanted to
just let him have it. But the words came out with some semblance of
tact.</p>
<p>“I hope you realize,” said Sherman, “I’m very unhappy about what
happened yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Ayyyyyy, who wouldn’t be? It was outrageous, even for Weiss.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you understand. I’m not talking about what I was
subjected to, per se, I’m talking about the fact that you—”</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the voice of the receptionist coming over the
intercom on Killian’s desk: “Neil Flannagan of the Daily News on
3–0.”</p>
<p>Killian leaned forward in his chair. “Tell him I’ll call him back.
No, wait a minute. Tell him I’ll call him back in thirty minutes. If
he’s out of the office, then he should call me back in thirty minutes.”
To Sherman: “Sorry.”</p>
<p>Sherman paused, looked balefully at the fop, and said, “I’m talking
about something else. I’m talking about—”</p>
<p>Killian broke in: “I don’t mean that we’re only gonna be talking for
thirty minutes.” Tawkin. “The whole day is yours if you want it and we
need it. But I wanna talk to this guy Flannagan, from the News. He’s
gonna be our antidote…to the venom.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s fine,” said Sherman as flatly as possible, “but we’ve
got a problem. You assured me you had your special ‘contacts’ in the
Bronx District Attorney’s Office. You told me you had a ‘contract’ with
this man Fitzgibbon. I seem to recall quite a dissertation on something
called the ‘Favor Bank.’ Now, don’t misinterpret what I’m saying. For
all I know, you may have as keen a legal mind—”</p>
<p>The voice on the intercom: “Peter Fallow of The City Light on
3–0.”</p>
<p>“Get his number. Tell him I’ll call him back.” To Sherman: “Speak of
the venom. The head snake checks in.”</p>
<p>Sherman’s heart shuddered in palpitation, then recovered.</p>
<p>“Go ahead. You were saying.”</p>
<p>“I’m not doubting your legal judgment, but you made these assurances
to me, and naïvely I went ahead and…” He paused to choose the correct
word.</p>
<p>Killian jumped in: “You were double-crossed, Sherman. I was
double-crossed. Bernie Fitzgibbon was double-crossed. What Weiss did was
unconscionable. You do…not…do…what he did. You do not do it.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, he did it, and after you told me—”</p>
<p>“I know what it was like. It was like being thrown in a cesspool. But
Bernie was not totally unsuccessful. Weiss wanted to do worse. You gotta
understand that. The sonofabitch wanted to arrest you in your home! He
wanted a Park Avenue arrest! He’s crazy, crazy, crazy! And you know what
he woulda done if he had his way? He woulda had the cops put handcuffs
on you in your own home, then take you to a precinct house and let you
get a whiff of the pens there for a while and then they put you in a van
with wire mesh over the windows, with a buncha these animals, and then
take you to Central Booking and let you go through what you went
through. That’s what he wanted.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless—”</p>
<p>“Mr. Killian, Irv Stone of Channel 1 on 3–2. This is the third time
he’s called.”</p>
<p>“Get his number and tell him I’ll call him back.” To Sherman: “Today
I gotta talk to these people even though I got nothing to tell them.
Just to keep the lines open. Tomorrow we start to turn things
around.”</p>
<p>“Turn things around,” said Sherman in what was meant as bitter irony.
The fop didn’t notice. The fop’s excitement over such attention from the
press was written all over his face. Out of my ignominy, his own cheap
glory.</p>
<p>So he tried it again. “Turn things around, all right,” he said.</p>
<p>Killian smiled. “Mr. McCoy, I do believe you doubt me. Well, I got
news for you. In fact, I got a lotta news for you.” He pressed the
intercom button. “Hey, Nina. Ask Quigley to come in here. Tell him
Mr. McCoy is here.” To Sherman: “Ed Quigley is our investigator, the guy
I told you about, the guy who used to be in Major Cases.”</p>
<p>A tall bald man appeared in the doorway. It was the same man Sherman
had seen in the blazing reception room on his first visit. He carried a
revolver in a holster high on his left hip. He wore a white shirt but no
tie. His sleeves were rolled up, revealing a pair of huge wrists and
hands. His left hand held a manila envelope. He was the sort of tall
angular raw-boned man who looks more powerful and menacing at fifty than
he did at twenty-five. His shoulders were wide but had a degenerate
slouch. His eyes seemed to have sunk deep into the occipital
craters.</p>
<p>“Ed,” said Killian, “this is Mr. McCoy.”</p>
<p>Sherman nodded morosely.</p>
<p>“Pleased to meet you,” said the man. He gave Sherman the same dead
smile he had given him the first time.</p>
<p>Killian said, “You got the picture?”</p>
<p>Quigley took a piece of paper out of the envelope and handed it to
Killian, and Killian handed it to Sherman.</p>
<p>“This is a Xerox, but it took—I’m not even gonna tell you what it
took to get this picture. You recognize him?”</p>
<p>A profile and a head-on picture of a black man, with numbers. Square
features, a powerful neck.</p>
<p>Sherman sighed. “It looks like him. The other boy, the big one, the
one who said, ‘Yo! Need some help?’”</p>
<p>“He’s a lowlife named Roland Auburn. Lives in the Poe projects. Right
now he’s on Rikers Island awaiting disposition of his fourth drug
indictment. Obviously he’s cutting a deal with the D.A. in return for
testimony against you.”</p>
<p>“And lying.”</p>
<p>“That does not in any way violate the principles that have governed
Mr. Roland Auburn’s life thus far,” said Killian.</p>
<p>“How did you find this out?”</p>
<p>Killian smiled and gestured toward Quigley. “Ed has many friends
among our men in blue, and many of our finest owe him favors.”</p>
<p>Quigley merely pursed his lips slightly.</p>
<p>Sherman said, “Has he ever been arrested for robbery—or the sort of
thing he tried to pull on me?”</p>
<p>“You mean highway robbery?” Killian chuckled at what he had just
said. “I never thoughta that before. That’s what it is, highway robbery.
Right, Ed?”</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>
<p>“Not that we know of,” said Killian, “but we intend to find out a
whole lot more about the sonofabitch. Prison inmates are notorious for
what they’ll testify to—and this is Weiss’s whole fucking case! This is
what he brought you in on!”</p>
<p>Killian shook his head, with apparent disgust, and kept shaking it.
Sherman found himself genuinely grateful. It was the first hint of
heartfelt absolution anyone had offered.</p>
<p>“All right, so that’s one thing,” said Killian. Then to Ed: “Now tell
him about Mrs. Ruskin.”</p>
<p>Sherman looked up at Quigley, and Quigley said, “She’s gone to Italy.
I traced her as far as a house she rented on Lake Como. It’s some kinda
resort in Lombardy.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Sherman. “She’d just come back from there the
night all this happened.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, a couple a days ago,” said Quigley, “she left there in a
car with some young guy named Filippo. That’s all I know, ‘Filippo.’ You
got any idea who that might be? Early or mid-twenties, slender, medium
height. Lotta hair. Punk clothes. Nice-looking kid, or so my man told
me.”</p>
<p>Sherman sighed. “It’s some artist she knows. Filippo Charazza or
Charizzi.”</p>
<p>“You know of any other place in Italy she might go?”</p>
<p>Sherman shook his head. “How did you find out all this?”</p>
<p>Quigley looked at Killian, and Killian said, “Tell him.”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t too hard,” said Quigley. Proud to be onstage, he couldn’t
resist a smile. “Most a these people have Globexpress. You know, the
credit card. There’s a woman—a person I deal with in the accounting
office on Duane Street. They got a computer network feeds in from all
over the world. I give her a hundred dollars per item. Not too bad for
five minutes’ work. Sure enough, this Maria Ruskin has two charges three
days ago in stores in this town, Como. Clothing stores. So I call up a
guy we use in Rome, and he calls up one of the stores and says he’s from
Globexpress and gives them her account number and says they need to send
her a telegram for ‘account clarification.’ They don’t give a shit. They
give him the address where they delivered the merchandise, and he goes
down to Como and checks it all.” Quigley shrugged, as if to say, “Piece
a cake for a guy like me.”</p>
<p>Noting that Sherman was properly impressed, Killian said, “So now we
got a line on both our players. We know who their witness is, and we’ll
find your friend Mrs. Ruskin. And we’ll get her back here, even if Ed
has to bring her back in a box with air holes in it. Don’t look shocked.
I know you give her the benefit of the doubt, but by objective standards
she does not exactly qualify as your friend. You’re in the biggest jam
of your life, and she’s your way out, and she’s off in Italy with a
nice-looking fellow named Filippo. Ayyyyyyyyy, whaddaya whaddaya?”</p>
<p>Sherman smiled in spite of himself. His vanity was such, however,
that he immediately assumed that there was an innocuous explanation.</p>
<p>After Quigley had left, Killian said: “Ed Quigley is the best. There
is no better private investigator in the business. He…will…do…anything.
He’s your basic hardcore New York Hell’s Kitchen Irishman. The kids Ed
ran with all became hoodlums or cops. The ones that became cops were the
ones that the Church got a hook into, the ones that cooked a little bit
from guilt. But they all like the same things. They all like to butt
heads and loosen people’s teeth. The only difference is, if you are a
cop, you can do it legally with the priest nodding over you and looking
the other way at the same time. Ed was a hell of a cop. He was a fucking
reign of terror.”</p>
<p>“How did he get this picture?” Sherman was looking at the Xeroxed
page. “Was that one of your…‘contracts’?”</p>
<p>“A thing like this? Oooooh. Fuhgedaboudit. Getting this
information—with a mug shot?—this is so far out of bounds—I mean, this
goes beyond the Favor Bank. I don’t ask, but unless I miss my guess,
this is the Favor Bank plus the real bank, like your basic negotiable
assets. Fuhgedaboudit. I mean it. For God’s sake, don’t mention it.
Don’t even think about it again.”</p>
<p>Sherman sat back in his chair and looked at Killian. He had come in
here to fire him—and now he wasn’t so sure.</p>
<p>As if reading his mind, Killian said: “Let me explain something to
you. It’s not that Abe Weiss doesn’t care about justice.” Doesn’t. He
had used the correct third person singular. What exalted notion,
wondered Sherman, had wandered into his head? “He probably does. But
this case has nothing to do with justice. This is a war. This is Abe
Weiss running for reelection, and that job is his fucking life, and when
the press gets as hot for a case as they are about this one, he don’t
know from justice. He’s gonna do any goddamned thing he has to do. I
don’t mean to frighten you, but that’s what’s going on, a war. I can’t
just construct a defense for you, I got to wage a campaign. I don’t
think he’d put a tap on your telephone, but he has that power and he’s
perfectly capable of doing it. So if I were you, I wouldn’t say anything
of substance about this case over the telephone. In fact, don’t say
anything at all about it on the telephone. That way you don’t have to
worry about what’s important and what isn’t.”</p>
<p>Sherman nodded to show he understood.</p>
<p>“Now I’m gonna be very direct with you, Sherman. This thing is gonna
cost a lot of money. You know what Quigley’s man in Lombardy costs? Two
thousand dollars a week, and that’s just one phase of what we got to do.
I’m gonna ask you for a big retainer, right up front. This is exclusive
of trial work, which I still hope will not be necessary.”</p>
<p>“How much?”</p>
<p>“Seventy-five thousand.”</p>
<p>“Seventy-five thousand?”</p>
<p>“Sherman, what can I tell you? The lawr is like anything else.
Awright? Yuh gedwudja pay for.”</p>
<p>“But, good Lord. Seventy-five thousand.”</p>
<p>“You force me to be immodest. We are the best. And I’ll fight for
you. I love a fight. I’m as Irish as Quigley.”</p>
<p>So Sherman, he who came to fire his lawyer, wrote out a check for
seventy-five thousand dollars.</p>
<p>He handed it to Killian. “You’ll have to give me some time to get
that much money into my account.”</p>
<p>“That’s fair enough. What’s today? Wednesday? I won’t deposit this
until Friday morning.”</p>
<p>The menu had little black-and-white ads across the bottom, little
rectangles with old-fashioned borders and highly stylized logos for
things like Nehi chocolate drink and Captain Henry’s Canned Herring Roe
and Café du Monde Dark Roast Coffee with Chicory and Indian Chief
Balloon Tire bicycles and Edgeworth Pipe Tobacco and 666 Cold
andandandand Cough Medicine. The ads were sheer decoration, mementos of
the old two-lane hardtop days in Louisiana bayou country. A sixth sense
made Kramer flinch. This faux—Down Home shit was as expensive as the
faux—Bohemian Casual shit. He didn’t even want to think what this was
all going to come to, maybe fifty goddamned dollars. But there was no
turning back now, was there? Shelly was sitting right across from him in
the booth watching his every gesture and expression, and he had spent
the past hour and a half projecting the image of a man who takes charge
and is in control, and it was he, the manly bon vivant, who had
suggested that they proceed forthwith to dessert and coffee. Besides, he
felt an acute need for ice cream. His mouth and his gullet were on fire.
The Café Alexandria didn’t seem to have a single item on any course that
wasn’t a conflagration. The Creole Gumbo with Bayou Sand—he thought the
word sand must be a metaphor for some gritty condiment, some ground-up
root or something, but there was actual sand in the goddamned soup,
apparently drenched in Tabasco. The Cornbread Cayenne—it was like bread
with fire ants in it. The Catfish Fillet with Scorched Okra on a Bed of
Yellow Rice with Apple Butter and Chinese Mustard Sauce—the Chinese
mustard raised a red flag, but he had to order the catfish because it
was the only semi-inexpensive entree on the menu, 0.50. And Andruitti
had said it was an inexpensive little Creole restaurant on Beach Street,
“really terrific.” Beach Street was a crummy enough street to have a
cheap restaurant, and so he had believed him.</p>
<p>But Shelly kept saying how wonderful it was. She was glowing, a
divine radiance with brown lipstick, although he wasn’t entirely sure
whether it was love, Autumn in the Berkshires makeup, or a fire in the
belly he was looking at.</p>
<p>Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream…He scanned the swampfire prose of the
menu, and through the caloric waves he spotted a single ice-cream dish:
Hand-Churned Vanilla Ice Cream Topped with Walnut Chili Chutney. Chili?
Well, he would scrape the topping to one side and stick to the ice
cream. He didn’t have the nerve to ask the trendy waitress with all the
honey curls to leave the topping off. He didn’t want to look like an
unadventurous wimp in front of Shelly.</p>
<p>Shelly ordered the Key Lime Tart with Relleno Pastry, and they both
ordered the Fresh Ground New Orleans Coffee with Chicory, even though
something told him the chicory meant more grief for his sizzling
innards.</p>
<p>Having placed the dessert and coffee order with a firm voice and
manly resolve, he put his forearms on the edge of the table and leaned
forward and poured his eyes back into Shelly’s, to give her a refill of
crime intoxication as well as the last of the bottle of Crockett Sump
White Zinfandel wine that was setting him back twelve dollars. That was
the next-to-cheapest wine on the wine list. He didn’t have the courage
to order the cheapest, which was a Chablis for .50. Only inexperienced
wet smacks ordered Chablis.</p>
<p>“I wish I could take you along and just have you listen to this
fellow, this Roland Auburn. I’ve interviewed him three times now. At
first he seems so tough, so hard, so…you know…menacing. He’s a rock,
with these dead eyes, the kind of teenager that’s in everybody’s
nightmare about a dark street in New York. But if you just listen to him
for five minutes—just listen—you start to hear something else. You hear
pain. He’s a boy, for God’s sake. He’s frightened. These boys grow up in
the ghetto without anybody ever caring about them, really. They’re
terrified. They erect this wall of machismo, thinking it’s gonna protect
them from harm, when in fact they’re ready at any moment to be
destroyed. That’s what they expect: they’re gonna be destroyed. No, I’m
not worried about Roland in front of a jury. What I’ll do is, I’ll lead
him through some innocuous questions about his background for the first
minute and a half or two minutes, and then he’ll start shedding this
tough-guy outer skin of his, without even knowing it, and they will
believe him. He won’t come across as a hardened criminal or a hardened
anything. He’ll come across as a frightened boy who’s yearning for just
a little bit of decency and just a little bit of beauty in his life,
because that is precisely what he is. I wish I could think of some way
to get the jury to see the drawings and collages he does. Shelly, he’s
brilliant. Brilliant! Well, there’s no way that’s gonna happen, I
suppose. It’s gonna be tricky enough just to make sure I lead the real
Roland Auburn out of his hard shell. It’s gonna be like getting a snail
outta one a those shells that goes in a spiral.”</p>
<p>Kramer twirled his finger in a spiral and laughed at his own simile.
Shelly’s shiny lips smiled appreciatively. They glistened. She
glistened.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’d love to attend the trial,” she said. “When will it be?”</p>
<p>“We don’t know yet.” (Me and the D.A., who happen to be very tight
with one another.) “We won’t even take it before the grand jury until
next week. We could go to trial in two months or six months. It’s hard
to say in a case that’s gotten as much publicity as this one has. When
the media go crazy over something, it complicates things.” He shook his
head, as if to say, “You just have to learn to put up with it.”</p>
<p>Shelly fairly beamed. “Larry, when I got home and turned on the
television last night, and there you were, that drawing of you—I just
started laughing, like a child. I said, ‘Larry!’ I said it right out
loud, as if you’d just stepped into the room. I couldn’t get over
it.”</p>
<p>“It kind of bowled me over, too, to tell you the truth.”</p>
<p>“I’d give anything to come to the trial. Could I?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“I promise I won’t do anything silly.”</p>
<p>Kramer felt a tingle. He knew this was the moment. He moved his hands
forward and slid the tips of his fingers under the tips of hers without
looking at them. She didn’t look down, either, and she didn’t pull back.
She kept looking into his eyes and pressed the tips of his fingers with
hers.</p>
<p>“I don’t care if you do something silly,” he said. His voice
surprised him. It was so hoarse and bashful.</p>
<p>Outside, with practically all his cash left behind in the Colorfully
Antiquated non-electric cash register of the Café Alexandria, he took
her hand and entwined his thick Pumping Iron fingers among her slender
tender fingers, and they began walking along in the decrepit darkness of
Beach Street.</p>
<p>“You know, Shelly, you can’t imagine what it means to me to have you
to talk to about all this. The fellows in my office—you try to get down
to the heart of anything with them and they think you’re turning soft.
And God help you if you turn soft. And my wife—I don’t know, she just
don’t—doesn’t want to hear it anymore, no matter what. By now she just
thinks she’s married to this guy who has this grim task to perform,
sending a lot of pathetic people off to jail. But this case is not
pathetic. You know what this case is? It’s a signal, a very important
signal to the people of this city who think they’re not part of the
social contract. You know? It’s about a man who thinks that his exalted
station in life relieves him of the obligation to treat the life of
someone at the bottom of the scale the way he would treat somebody like
himself. I don’t doubt for a minute that if he had run down anybody even
remotely like himself, McCoy would have done the right thing. He’s
probably what we all know of as ‘a decent sort.’ That’s what makes it
fascinating. He’s not an evil person at all—but he did an evil thing. Do
you follow me?”</p>
<p>“I guess. The only thing I don’t understand is why Henry Lamb didn’t
say anything about being hit by a car when he went to the hospital. And
now that you’ve told me about your witness, Roland—there hasn’t been
anything in the papers about him, has there?”</p>
<p>“No, and we won’t release anything about him for a while. What I’ve
told you is just between us.”</p>
<p>“Well, anyway, now it turns out Roland didn’t say anything about his
friend being hit by a car for almost two weeks after it happened. Isn’t
that a little odd?”</p>
<p>“What’s odd about it! My God, Shelly, Lamb was suffering from a fatal
head injury, or it’s probably fatal, and Roland knew he’d be arrested
for a major felony if he talked to the cops! I wouldn’t call it
odd.”</p>
<p>Miss Shelly Thomas decided to back out of that avenue. “Odd isn’t
what I really meant. I guess I meant—I don’t envy you, the kind of
preparation and research you must have to do to get ready for one of
these cases.”</p>
<p>“Hah! If I got paid overtime for all the hours I’m gonna have to put
into this one—well, I could move to Park Avenue myself. But you know
what? That doesn’t matter to me. It really doesn’t. All I care about is,
whatever kind of life I lead, I want to be able to look back and say, ‘I
made a difference.’ This case is so important, on every conceivable
level, not just in terms of my career. It’s just a…I don’t know how to
say it…a whole new chapter. I want to make a difference, Shelly.”</p>
<p>He stopped and, still holding her hand, put it behind her waist and
then pulled her to him. She was looking up at him, radiantly. Their lips
met. He peeked just once, to see if she was keeping her eyes closed. She
was.</p>
<p>Kramer could feel her lower abdomen pressed against his. Was that the
knob of her mons veneris? It had come along this far, this fast, so
sweetly, so beautifully—and damn! No place to take her!</p>
<p>Imagine! Him! The budding star of the McCoy case—and no place—no
place at all!—in the very Babylon of the twentieth century!—to take a
lovely willing girl with brown lipstick. He wondered what was going
through her mind at this moment.</p>
<p>In fact, she was thinking about the way men are in New York. Every
time you go out with one, you have to sit there and listen to two or
three hours of My Career first.</p>
<p>It was a triumphant Peter Fallow who entered Leicester’s that
evening. Everyone at the Table, and scores more among those who packed
that noisy bistro, even those who turned up their noses at The City
Light, knew that it was he who had broken the McCoy case. Even St. John
and Billy, who were seldom serious about anything other than one
another’s infidelities, offered congratulations with apparent sincerity.
Sampson Reith, the London Daily Courier’s political correspondent, who
was out here for a few days, happened by the Table and told of his lunch
with Irwin Gubner, deputy managing editor of The New York Times, who
lamented that The City Light had the story practically to itself, which
of course meant Peter Fallow, keeper and tender. Alex Britt-Withers sent
over a vodka Southside, on the house, and it tasted so good Fallow
ordered another. The tidal wave of approval was so great that Caroline
smiled the first smile he’d had from her in a very long time. The only
sour note was Nick Stopping. His approval was decidedly soft-spoken and
halfhearted. Then Fallow realized that Nick, the Marxist-Leninist, the
Oxford Sparticist, the Rousseau of the Third World, was no doubt
consumed with jealousy. This was his sort of story, not this shallow
comedian Fallow’s—Fallow could now regard Nick’s opinion of him with
magnanimous amusement—and yet here was Fallow at the forefront, riding
the freight train of History, while he, Stopping, was writing yet
another piece for House andandandand Garden on the latest Mrs. Posh’s
villa in Hobe Sound, or wherever.</p>
<p>Well, speaking of posh, Rachel Lampwick did twit him quite a bit
about using that word so much. “Peter, I do think you might be a bit
more gallant”—she pronounced it the French way—“toward this Mrs. McCoy,
don’t you? I mean, you do go on about the posh Mr. McCoy and his posh
auto and his posh flat and his posh job and his posh daddy and his posh
girlfriend—or what did you call her?—‘foxy’?—I rather like that—and poor
Mrs. McCoy is just his ‘forty-year-old wife,’ which of course means very
plain, doesn’t it? Not very gallant, Peter.”</p>
<p>But obviously Rachel had been devouring every word he wrote. So he
felt nothing but a victor’s warmth toward her and one and all.</p>
<p>“The City Light doesn’t consider wives glamorous unless they’re
unfaithful,” said Fallow. “We save our enthusiasm for Other Women.”</p>
<p>Then everyone began to speculate about the Foxy Brunette, and Billy
Cortez, casting an eye toward St. John, said he had heard of men taking
their little tarts to out-of-the-way places to avoid detection, but,
really, the Bronx indicated rather advanced paranoia, and Fallow ordered
another vodka Southside.</p>
<p>The hubbub was warm and happy and English, and the orange and ocher
glows of Leicester’s were mellow and English, and Caroline was staring
at him quite a lot, sometimes smiling, sometimes looking at him with a
smirk, and it did make him curious, and he had another vodka Southside,
and Caroline got up from her place and walked around the table to where
he was and leaned over and said into his ear, “Come upstairs with me a
minute.”</p>
<p>Could it be? It was so very unlikely, but—could it be? They went up
the spiral staircase in the back to Britt-Withers’s office, and
Caroline, suddenly looking serious, said, “Peter, I probably shouldn’t
tell you what I’m going to tell you. You really don’t deserve it. You
haven’t been very nice to me.”</p>
<p>“Me!” said Fallow with a jolly laugh. “Caroline! You tried to spread
my snout all over New York!”</p>
<p>“What? Your snout?” Caroline smiled through a blush. “Well, not all
over New York. In any event, after the gift I’m about to give you, I
think we can call it even.”</p>
<p>“The gift?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s a gift. I know who your Foxy Brunette is. I know who
was in the car with McCoy.”</p>
<p>“You’re joking.”</p>
<p>“I’m not joking.”</p>
<p>“All right—who?”</p>
<p>“Her name is Maria Ruskin. You met her that night at the
Limelight.”</p>
<p>“I did?”</p>
<p>“Peter, you get so drunk. She’s the wife of a man named Arthur
Ruskin, who’s about three times her age. He’s a Jewish
something-or-other. Very rich.”</p>
<p>“How do you know this?”</p>
<p>“Do you remember my friend the artist? The Italian? Filippo? Filippo
Chirazzi?”</p>
<p>“Ah yes. Couldn’t very well forget him, could I?”</p>
<p>“Well, he knows her.”</p>
<p>“How does he know her?”</p>
<p>“The same way a lot of men know her. She’s a slut.”</p>
<p>“And she told him?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And he told you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“My God, Caroline. Where can I find him?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I can’t find him myself. The little bastard.”</p>
