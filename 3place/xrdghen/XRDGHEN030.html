<h4 id="an-able-pupil">30. An Able Pupil</h4>
<p>The grand-jury rooms in the island fortress were not like regular
courtrooms. They were like small amphitheaters. The members of the grand
jury looked down on the table and chair where the witnesses sat. Off to
one side was the clerk’s table. There was no judge in a grand-jury
proceeding. The prosecutor sat his witnesses down in the chair and
questioned them, and the grand jury decided either that the case was
strong enough to put the defendant on trial or that it wasn’t and threw
the case out. The concept, which had originated in England in 1681, was
that the grand jury would protect the citizenry against unscrupulous
prosecutors. That was the concept, and the concept had become a joke. If
a defendant wanted to testify before the grand jury, he could bring his
lawyer into the grand-jury room. If he was (a) perplexed or (b)
petrified or (c) grievously abused by the prosecutor’s questions, he
could leave the room and confer with a lawyer outside in the hall—and
thereby look like someone who was (b) petrified, a defendant with
something to hide. Not many defendants took the chance. Grand-jury
hearings had become a show run by the prosecutor. With rare exceptions,
a grand jury did whatever a prosecutor indicated he wanted them to do.
Ninety-nine percent of the time he wanted them to indict the defendant,
and they obliged without a blink. They were generally law-and-order folk
anyway. They were chosen from longtime residents of the community. Every
now and then, when political considerations demanded it, a prosecutor
wanted to have a charge thrown out. No problem; he merely had to couch
his presentation in a certain way, give a few verbal winks, as it were,
and the grand jury would catch on immediately. But mainly you used the
grand jury to indict people, and in the famous phrase of Sol Wachtler,
chief judge of the State Court of Appeals, a grand jury would “indict a
ham sandwich,” if that’s what you wanted.</p>
<p>You presided over the proceedings, you presented the evidence,
questioned the witnesses, gave the summations. You stood up while the
witnesses sat. You orated, gestured, walked about, spun on your heels,
shook your head in disbelief or smiled in paternal approbation, while
the witnesses sat properly in their seats and looked up at you for
direction. You were both the director and the star of this little
amphitheater production. The stage was all yours.</p>
<p>And Larry Kramer had rehearsed his actors well.</p>
<p>The Roland Auburn who came walking into the grand-jury room this
morning neither looked nor walked like the hard case who had popped up
in Kramer’s office two weeks ago. He wore a button-down shirt, albeit
with no necktie; it had been enough of a struggle to get him into the
lame Brooks Brothers button-down shirt. He wore a blue-gray tweed sport
jacket, of which his opinion was roughly the same, and a pair of black
pants, which he already owned and weren’t too bad. The whole ensemble
had nearly come apart over the issue of the shoes. Roland had an
obsession with Reebok sneakers, which had to be new-right-out-of-the-box
snow white. At Rikers Island he managed to get two new pairs per week.
This showed the world that he was a hard case worthy of respect inside
the walls and a shrewd player with connections outside. To ask him to
walk out of Rikers without his white Reeboks was like asking a singer to
cut off his hair. So Kramer finally let him leave Rikers with the
Reeboks on, with the understanding that he would change into a pair of
leather shoes in the car before they arrived at the courthouse. The
shoes were loafers, which Roland found contemptible. He demanded
assurances that no one he knew or might know be allowed to see him in
this lame condition. The final problem was the Pimp Roll. Roland was
like a runner who’s been running marathons too long; very hard to change
the stride. Finally Kramer had a brainstorm. He had Roland walk with his
hands clasped behind his back, the way he had seen Prince Philip and
Prince Charles walk on television while inspecting an artifacts museum
in New Guinea. It worked! The clasped hands locked his shoulders, and
the locked shoulders threw his hip rhythm off. So now, as Roland came
walking into the grand-jury room, toward the table at center stage, in
his preppy clothes, he could have passed for a student at Lawrenceville
ruminating over the Lake poets.</p>
<p>Roland took his seat on the witness chair the way Kramer had told him
to; that is, without rearing back and spreading his legs as if he owned
the joint and without popping his knuckles.</p>
<p>Kramer looked at Roland and then turned and faced the grand jury and
took a few steps this way and a few steps that way and gave them a
thoughtful smile, in such a way as to announce, without saying a word:
“This is a sympathetic and believable individual sitting before
you.”</p>
<p>Kramer asked Roland to state his occupation, and Roland said softly,
modestly, “I’m an artist.” Kramer asked him if he was currently
employed. No, he was not, said Roland. Kramer nodded for a few moments,
then began a line of questioning that brought out precisely why this
young man of talent, this young man eager to find an outlet for his
creativity, had not found the proper outlet and was, in fact, currently
facing a minor drug charge. (The Crack King of Evergreen Avenue had
abdicated and become a mere serf of the environment.) Like his friend
Henry Lamb, but without Henry Lamb’s advantages in terms of a stable
home life, Roland had challenged the crushing odds against young men in
the projects and emerged with his dreams intact. There was just this
matter of keeping body and soul together, and Roland had drifted into a
pernicious commerce but one not at all uncommon in the ghetto. Neither
he, the prosecutor, nor Roland, the witness, was attempting to hide or
minimize his petty crimes; but given the environment in which he had
lived, they should not impair his credibility among fair-minded people
in a matter as grave as the fate of Henry Lamb.</p>
<p>Charles Dickens, he who explained the career of Oliver Twist,
couldn’t have done it any better, at least not on his feet in a
grand-jury room in the Bronx.</p>
<p>Then Kramer led Roland through the narrative of the hit-and-run
accident. He lingered lovingly on one particular moment. It was the
moment at which the foxy-looking brunette yelled at the tall man who’d
been driving the car.</p>
<p>“And what did she say to him, Mr. Auburn?”</p>
<p>“She say, ‘Shuhmun, watch out.’”</p>
<p>“She said Shuhmun?”</p>
<p>“That’s what it sound like to me.”</p>
<p>“Would you say that name again, Mr. Auburn, exactly the way you heard
it that night?”</p>
<p>“Shuhman.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Shuhmun, watch out’?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. ‘Shuhmun, watch out.’”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Kramer turned toward the jurors, and let Shuhmun float
there in the air.</p>
<p>The individual sitting in that witness chair was a young man of those
mean streets whose bravest and best efforts had not been enough to save
Henry Lamb from the criminal negligence and irresponsibility of a Park
Avenue investment banker. Carl Brill, the gypsy-cab operator, came into
the room and told how Roland Auburn had indeed hired one of his cabs to
rescue Henry Lamb. Edgar (Curly Kale) Tubb told of driving Mr. Auburn
and Mr. Lamb to the hospital. He could remember nothing of what Mr. Lamb
said except that he was in pain.</p>
<p>Officers William Martin and David Goldberg told of their dogged
police work in tracing part of a license number to an investment banker
on Park Avenue who became flustered and evasive. They told how Roland
Auburn, without hesitation, identified Sherman McCoy from a lineup of
photographs. A parking-garage attendant named Daniel Podernli told of
how Sherman McCoy had taken his Mercedes-Benz roadster out on the night
in question, during the hours in question, and had returned in a state
of dishevelment and agitation.</p>
<p>They all came in and sat down at the table and looked up at the
forceful but patient young assistant district attorney, whose every
gesture, every pause, every stride said, “We have but to let them tell
their story their own way, and the truth makes itself manifest.”</p>
<p>And then he brought her in. Maria Ruskin came into the amphitheater
from an antechamber, where a court officer manned the door. She was
superb. She had struck just the right note in her wardrobe, a black
dress with a matching jacket edged in black velvet. She had not dressed
up, and she had not dressed down. She was the perfect widow in mourning
who had business to attend to. And yet her youth, her voluptuousness,
her erotic presence, her sensual self seemed ready to burst forth from
those clothes, from that stunning but composed face, from that full
flawless head of dark hair ready to be tousled with mad abandon—at any
moment!—on any pretext!—with the next tickle!—the merest wink! Kramer
could hear the jurors rustling and buzzing. They had read the
newspapers. They had watched television. The Foxy Brunette, the Mystery
Girl, the Financier’s Widow—it was her.</p>
<p>Involuntarily Kramer pulled in his midsection and flattened his
abdomen and threw back his shoulders and his head. He wanted her to see
his powerful chest and neck, not his unlucky pate. Too bad he couldn’t
tell the jury the whole story. They would enjoy it. They would view him
with renewed respect. The very fact that she had walked through that
door and was now sitting at this table, right on cue, had been a
triumph, his triumph, and not merely of his words but of his particular
presence. But of course he couldn’t tell them about his visit to the
Foxy Brunette’s apartment, to her containerized palace.</p>
<p>Had she decided to support McCoy in the story he had concocted about
a robbery on a ramp, it would have been very much a problem. The whole
case would have been thrown back on the credibility of Roland Auburn,
the erstwhile Crack King who was now trying to leverage himself out of a
jail term. Roland’s testimony provided the foundation for a case, but
not a very solid one, and Roland was capable of blowing it at any
moment, not by what he said—Kramer had no doubt that he was telling the
truth—but through his demeanor. But now he had her, too. He had gone to
her apartment and looked her in the eye, her and her Wasp retainers,
too, and he had put her in a box, a box of irrefutable logic and dread
of the Power. He had put her in that box so quickly and securely she
hadn’t even known what was happening. She had swallowed—gulped—gulped
her multimillion-dollar gulp—and it was all over. By nightfall Messrs.
Tucker Trigg and Clifford Priddy—Trigg and Priddy, Priddy and Trigg—oh,
ye Wasps!—had been on the telephone to make the deal.</p>
<p>Now she was seated before him, and he looked down at her and let his
eyes fasten upon hers, seriously at first and then with (or so he
imagined it) a twinkle.</p>
<p>“Would you please state your full name and address.”</p>
<p>“Maria Teresa Ruskin, 962 Fifth Avenue.”</p>
<p>Very good, Maria Teresa! It was he himself, Kramer, who had
discovered her middle name was Teresa. He had figured there would be a
few older Italian and Puerto Rican women on the grand jury, and sure
enough there were. Maria Teresa would bring her closer to them. A touchy
matter, her beauty and her money. The jurors were staring ropes. They
couldn’t get enough of her. She was the most glamorous human being they
had ever seen in the flesh. How long had it been since anybody had sat
in a witness chair in this room and given an address on Fifth Avenue in
the Seventies? She was everything they were not and (Kramer was sure)
wanted to be: young, gorgeous, chic, and unfaithful. And yet that could
be a positive advantage, so long as she behaved in a certain fashion, so
long as she was humble and modest and seemed slightly abashed by the
scale of her own advantages, so long as she was little Maria Teresa from
a small town in South Carolina. So long as she took pains to be one of
us at heart, they would feel flattered by their association with her in
this excursion into criminal justice, by her success and celebrity, by
the very aura of her money.</p>
<p>He asked her to state her occupation. She hesitated and stared at him
with her lips parted slightly, then said, “Umm…I’m a”…Um-uh…“uh guess
um-uh housewife.”</p>
<p>A rush of laughter ran through the jurors, and Maria cast her eyes
down and smiled modestly and shook her head slightly, as if to say, “I
know it sounds ridiculous, but I don’t know what else to say.” Kramer
could tell by the way the jurors smiled in return that so far they were
on her side. They were already captivated by this rare and beautiful
bird who now fluttered before them in the Bronx.</p>
<p>Kramer took this moment to say, “I think the jurors should be made
aware that Mrs. Ruskin’s husband, Mr. Arthur Ruskin, passed away just
five days ago. Under these circumstances, we are indebted to her for her
willingness to come forward at this time and cooperate with this jury in
these deliberations.”</p>
<p>The jurors stared at Maria all over again. Brave, brave girl!</p>
<p>Maria lowered her eyes again, quite becomingly.</p>
<p>Good girl, Maria! “Maria Teresa”…“Housewife”…If only he could give
these worthy jurors a little exegesis of how he had coached her in these
small but telling points. All true and honest!—but even truth and
honesty can disappear without a light. So far she had been a bit cool
toward him, but she followed directions and thereby signaled her
respect. Well, there would be many sessions to come, when they went to
trial—and even at this moment, in this room, under these austere
circumstances, at this plain dock of justice, there was something about
her—ready to burst forth! A crook of the finger…a single wink…</p>
<p>Calmly, quietly, to show how difficult he knew this must be for her,
he began to lead her through the events of the fateful evening.
Mr. McCoy had picked her up at Kennedy Airport. (No need, for the
purposes of these proceedings, to say why.) They get lost in the Bronx.
They’re a bit anxious. Mr. McCoy is driving in the left lane of a wide
avenue. She sees a sign over on the right indicating a way back to an
expressway. He suddenly veers right at a high speed. He’s heading
straight for two boys standing on the edge of the pavement. He sees them
too late. He grazes one, nearly hits the other. She tells him to stop.
He does.</p>
<p>“Now, Mrs. Ruskin, would you please tell us…At this point, when
Mr. McCoy stopped, was the car on the ramp to the expressway or on the
avenue itself?”</p>
<p>“It was on the avenue.”</p>
<p>“The avenue.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And was there any obstruction or barricade or any kind of obstacle
that caused Mr. McCoy to stop the car where he did?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“All right, tell us what happened then.”</p>
<p>Mr. McCoy got out to see what had happened, and she opened the door
and looked back. They could see both youths heading toward the car.</p>
<p>“And would you please tell us your reaction when you observed them
coming toward you?”</p>
<p>“I was frightened. I thought they were going to attack us—because of
what had happened.”</p>
<p>“Because Mr. McCoy had hit one of them?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Eyes downcast, perhaps in shame.</p>
<p>“Did they threaten you verbally or through any sort of gesture?”</p>
<p>“No, they did not.” More shame.</p>
<p>“But you thought they might attack you.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” A humble tone.</p>
<p>A kindly voice: “Could you explain why?”</p>
<p>“Because we were in the Bronx, and it was at night.”</p>
<p>A gentle, paternal voice: “Is it also possible that it was because
these two young men were black?”</p>
<p>A pause. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Do you think Mr. McCoy felt the same way?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Did he at any time, verbally, indicate that he felt that way?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he did.”</p>
<p>“What did he say?”</p>
<p>“I don’t remember exactly, but we talked about it later, and he said
it was like being in a fight in the jungle.”</p>
<p>“A fight in the jungle? These two young men walking toward you, after
one of them has been struck by Mr. McCoy’s car—this was like a fight in
the jungle?”</p>
<p>“That was what he said. Yes.”</p>
<p>Kramer paused to let that sink in. “All right. The two young men are
approaching Mr. McCoy’s car. What did you do then?”</p>
<p>“What did I do?”</p>
<p>“What did you do—or say?”</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Sherman, watch out.’” Shuhmun. One of the jurors
giggled.</p>
<p>Kramer said, “Would you repeat that, please, Mrs. Ruskin? Repeat what
you said to Mr. McCoy?”</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Shuhmun, watch out.’”</p>
<p>“Now, Mrs. Ruskin…if you’ll permit me…You have a distinctive accent.
You give Mr. McCoy’s first name a soft pronunciation. Shuhmun. Isn’t
that correct?”</p>
<p>A regretful but becoming little smile crossed her face. “I guess so.
You’re a better judge than I am.”</p>
<p>“Well, would you pronounce it in your own way for us, just once more?
Mr. McCoy’s first name.”</p>
<p>“Shuhmun.”</p>
<p>Kramer turned toward the jurors and just looked at them. Shuhmun.</p>
<p>“All right, Mrs. Ruskin, what happened next?”</p>
<p>She told how she slid behind the wheel and Mr. McCoy got in the
passenger seat, and she sped off, very nearly hitting the young man who
had escaped injury when Mr. McCoy was driving. Once they were safely
back on the expressway, she had wanted to report the incident to the
police. But Mr. McCoy would have none of it.</p>
<p>“Why was he reluctant to report what had happened?”</p>
<p>“He said he was driving when it happened, and so it was his decision
to make, and he wasn’t going to report it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but he must have offered a reason.”</p>
<p>“He said it was just an incident in the jungle, and it wouldn’t do
any good to report it anyway, and he didn’t want word to get back to his
employer and his wife. I think he was more worried about his wife.”</p>
<p>“Knowing that he had hit someone with his car?”</p>
<p>“Knowing that he had picked me up at the airport.” Eyes downcast.</p>
<p>“And that was reason enough not to report that a young man had been
struck and, as it turns out, gravely injured?”</p>
<p>“Well—I don’t know. I don’t know everything that was on his mind.”
Softly; sadly.</p>
<p>Very good, Maria Teresa! An able pupil! Most becoming, to confess the
limits of your knowledge!</p>
<p>And thus the lovely Widow Ruskin sank Mr. Sherman McCoy like a
stone.</p>
<p>Kramer left the grand-jury room in the state of bliss known chiefly
to athletes who have just won a great victory. He tried hard to suppress
a smile.</p>
<p>“Hey, Larry!”</p>
<p>Bernie Fitzgibbon was hurrying toward him down the hall. Good! Now he
had a war story and a half for the black Irishman.</p>
<p>But before he could get out the first word about his triumph, Bernie
said, “Larry, have you seen this?”</p>
<p>He thrust a copy of The City Light toward him.</p>
<p>Quigley, who had just come in, picked up The City Light from
Killian’s desk and read it for himself. Sherman sat beside the desk in
the miserable fiberglass armchair and averted his eyes, but he could
still see it, the front page.</p>
<p>A band across the top read: EXCLUSIVE! NEW MCCOY CASE SHOCKER!</p>
<p>On the upper left-hand side of the page was a picture of Maria in a
low-cut dress with the tops of her breasts welling up and her lips
parted. The picture was set into a headline of enormous black type that
read:</p>
<p>Come</p>
<p>Into My</p>
<p>Rent-Controlled</p>
<p>Love Nest!</p>
<p>Below, a band of smaller type:</p>
<p>Millionairess Maria Entertained</p>
<p>Mccoy In 31-A-Month Tryst</p>
<p>Pad By Peter Fallow.</p>
<p>Killian was behind the desk, leaning back in his swivel chair and
studying Sherman’s gloomy face.</p>
<p>“Look,” said Killian, “don’t worryboudit. It’s a sleazy story, but it
don’t hurt our case any. Maybe it helps. It tends to undermine her
credibility. She comes off looking like a hooker.”</p>
<p>“That’s very true,” said Quigley, in a voice that was supposed to be
encouraging. “We already know where she was when her husband was dying.
She was in Italy shacked up with some kid named Filippo. And now here’s
this guy Winter saying she had guys up there all the time. This Winter’s
a prince, ain’t he, Tommy?”</p>
<p>“A real lovable landlord,” said Killian. Then to Sherman: “If Maria
rats you out, then this can only help. Not a lot, but some.”</p>
<p>“I’m not thinking about the case,” said Sherman. He sighed and let
his great chin sink down to his collarbone. “I’m thinking about my wife.
This will do it. I think she’d halfway forgiven me, or at least she was
going to be with me, she was going to keep our family together. But this
will do it.”</p>
<p>“You got involved with a high-class hooker,” said Killian. “It
happens all the time. It’s not that big a deal.”</p>
<p>Hooker? To his own surprise, Sherman felt an urge to defend Maria.
But what he said was: “Unfortunately, I swore to my wife that I’d
never…never done anything but flirt with her once or twice.”</p>
<p>“You really think she believed that?” said Killian.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter,” said Sherman. “I swore that was the truth, and
then I asked her to forgive me. I made a big point of it. And now she
learns with the rest of New York, with the rest of the world, from the
front page of a tabloid, that I was…I don’t know…” He shook his
head.</p>
<p>“Well, it wasn’t as if it was anything serious,” said Quigley. “The
woman’s a high-class hooker, like Tommy says.”</p>
<p>“Don’t call her that,” said Sherman in a low, melancholy voice,
without looking at Quigley. “She’s the only decent person in this whole
mess.”</p>
<p>Killian said, “She’s so decent she’s gonna rat you out, if she ain’t
already done it.”</p>
<p>“She was prepared to do the right thing,” said Sherman. “I’m
convinced of that, and I shoved her good instincts right back in her
face.”</p>
<p>“Gedoudahere. I don’t believe I’m listening to this.”</p>
<p>“She didn’t call me up and ask me to meet her in that apartment in
order to do me in. I went there wired…to do her in. What did she have to
gain by seeing me? Nothing. Her lawyers probably told her to have
nothing to do with me.”</p>
<p>Killian nodded. “That’s true.”</p>
<p>“But that isn’t the way Maria’s mind works. She isn’t cautious. She
isn’t going to turn legalistic, just because she’s in a tight corner. I
once told you her medium was men, and that’s the truth, just the way
a…a…a dolphin’s medium is the sea.”</p>
<p>“Would you settle for a shark?” said Killian.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Okay, have it your way. She’s a mermaid.”</p>
<p>“You can call her what you want. But I’m convinced that whatever she
was going to do in this case concerning me, a man she’d been involved
with, she wasn’t going to do it behind a screen of lawyers—and she
wasn’t going to come wired…for evidence. Whatever was going to happen,
she wanted to see me, be next to me, have a real talk with me, an honest
talk, not some game with words—and go to bed with me. You may think I’m
crazy, but that’s exactly what she wanted to do.”</p>
<p>Killian just raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“I also believe she didn’t go to Italy to duck out of this case. I
think she went for exactly the reason she said. To get away from her
husband…and from me…and I don’t blame her…and to go have fun with a
good-looking boy. You can call that being a hooker if you want, but
she’s the only one in this whole thing who’s walked in a straight
line.”</p>
<p>“That’s a neat trick, walking on your back,” said Killian. “What’s C.
S. Lewis’s emergency night-line number? We got a whole new concept of
morality going here.”</p>
<p>Sherman drove his fist into his hand. “I can’t believe what I’ve
done. If I had only played it straight with her! Me!—with my pretensions
of respectability and propriety! And now look at this.”</p>
<p>He picked up The City Light, more than ready to drown himself in his
public shame. “ ‘Love nest’…‘tryst pad’…a picture of the very bed where
‘the millionairess Maria entertained McCoy’…This is what my wife picks
up, she and a couple of million other people…and my daughter…My little
girl’s almost seven. Her little friends will be perfectly capable of
filling her in on what all this means…and ready and eager…You can be
sure of that…Imagine. That sonofabitch, Winter, he’s so slimy he takes
the press in to take a picture of the bed!”</p>
<p>Quigley said, “They’re wild men, Mr. McCoy, these landlords in the
rent-controlled buildings. They’re maniacs. They got one thing on their
minds from morning to night, and that’s getting tenants out. Ain’t no
Sicilian hates anybody worse than a rent-control landlord hates his
tenants. They think the tenants are stealing their life’s blood. They go
crazy. This guy sees Maria Ruskin’s picture in the paper, and she’s got
a twenty-room apartment on Fifth Avenue, and he flips out and goes
running to the newspaper.”</p>
<p>Sherman opened the newspaper to page 3, where the full story began.
There was a picture of the front of the brownstone. Another picture of
Maria, looking young and sexy. A picture of Judy looking old and
haggard. Another picture of himself…and his aristocratic chin…and a big
grin…</p>
<p>“That’ll do it,” he said to himself, but loud enough for Killian and
Quigley to hear. Sinking, sinking, diving down into his shame…Reading
aloud:</p>
<p>“ ‘Winter said he had information that Mrs. Ruskin was paying 50 a
month under the table to the actual leaseholder, Germaine Boll, who then
paid the 31 controlled rent.’ That’s true,” said Sherman, “but I wonder
how he knew it? Maria didn’t tell him, and I’m sure Germaine didn’t tell
him. Maria mentioned it to me once, but I never mentioned it to a
soul.”</p>
<p>“Where?” asked Quigley.</p>
<p>“Where what?”</p>
<p>“Where were you when she told you about it?”</p>
<p>“I was…It was the last time I was in the apartment. It was the day
the first story came out in The City Light. It was the day that big
lunatic, that Hasidic monster, came barging in.”</p>
<p>“Ayyyy,” said Quigley. A smile spread over his face. “You see it,
Tommy?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Killian.</p>
<p>“Well, I do,” said Quigley. “I could be wrong, but I think I see
it.”</p>
<p>“See what?”</p>
<p>“That sneaky sonofabitch,” said Quigley.</p>
<p>“Whaddaya talking about?”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you later,” said Quigley, still grinning. “Right now I’m
going over there.”</p>
<p>He left the room and went walking down the corridor at a good
clip.</p>
<p>“What’s he doing?” asked Sherman.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” said Killian.</p>
<p>“Where’s he going?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I let him do what he wants. Quigley is a force of
nature.”</p>
<p>Killian’s telephone rang, and the receptionist’s voice came over the
intercom. “It’s Mr. Fitzgibbon on 3–0.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take it,” said Killian, and he picked up the telephone. “Yeah,
Bernie?”</p>
<p>Killian listened, with his eyes looking down, but every now and then
they turned up and picked out Sherman. He took some notes. Sherman could
feel his heart starting to bang away.</p>
<p>“On what theory?” said Killian. He listened a bit more. “That’s
bullshit, and you know it…Yeah, well, I’m…I’m…What?…Whose part’s it
going into?…Unh hunh…” After a while he said, “Yeah, he’ll be there.” He
looked up at Sherman when he said that. “Okay. Thanks, Bernie.”</p>
<p>He hung up and said to Sherman, “Well…the grand jury has returned an
indictment against you. She ratted you out.”</p>
<p>“He told you that?”</p>
<p>“No. He can’t talk about what goes on inside the grand jury. But he
put it there between the lines.”</p>
<p>“What does this mean? What happens now?”</p>
<p>“The first thing that happens is, tomorrow morning the D.A. petitions
the court to set higher bail.”</p>
<p>“Higher bail? How can they do that?”</p>
<p>“The theory is that now that you’ve been indicted, you’ll have an
increased motivation to flee the jurisdiction of the court.”</p>
<p>“But that’s absurd!”</p>
<p>“Of course it is, but that’s what they’re doing, and you got to be
there for it.”</p>
<p>A terrible realization was beginning to come over Sherman. “How much
will they ask for?”</p>
<p>“Bernie don’t know, but it’ll be a lot. Half a million. A quarter of
a million, anyway. Some bullshit figure. It’s just Weiss playing for the
headlines, playing for the black vote.”</p>
<p>“But—can they actually put it that high?”</p>
<p>“It all depends on the judge. The hearing’s before Kovitsky, who’s
also the supervising judge of the grand jury. He’s got a pair a stones.
With him, at least you got a fighting chance.”</p>
<p>“But if they do it—how long do I have to raise the money?”</p>
<p>“How long? As soon as you post the bond, you’re out.”</p>
<p>“I’m out?” Terrible realization—“What do you mean, out?”</p>
<p>“Out of custody.”</p>
<p>“But why would I be in custody?”</p>
<p>“Well, as soon as a new bail is set, you’re in custody until you post
bond, unless you post it immediately.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute, Tommy. You don’t mean that if they raise my bail
tomorrow morning, they put me in custody immediately, right there, as
soon as the bail is set?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah. But don’t jump to conclusions.”</p>
<p>“You mean they take me right there in the courtroom?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, if—but don’t—”</p>
<p>“Take me and put me where?”</p>
<p>“Well, the Bronx House of Dentention, probably. But the point
is—”</p>
<p>Sherman began shaking his head. He felt as if the lining of his skull
were inflamed. “I can’t do that, Tommy.”</p>
<p>“Don’t immediately assume the worst! There’s things we can do.”</p>
<p>Still shaking his head: “There’s no way I can get half a million
dollars this afternoon and put it in a bag.”</p>
<p>“I’m not talking”—tawkin—“about anything like that, f’r Chrissake.
It’s a bail hearing. The judge has to hear the arguments. We got a good
argument.”</p>
<p>“Oh sure,” said Sherman. “You said yourself the thing’s a political
football.” He hung his head and shook it some more. “Jesus Christ,
Tommy, I can’t do it.”</p>
<p>Ray Andriutti was whaling down his pepperoni and his coffee swill,
and Jimmy Caughey held half a roast-beef hero up in the air like a baton
while he talked to somebody on the telephone about some piece a shit
he’d been assigned to. Kramer wasn’t hungry. He kept reading the story
in The City Light. He was fascinated. Rent-controlled love nest, 31 a
month. The revelation didn’t really affect the case much one way or the
other. Maria Ruskin wouldn’t come off as quite the sympathetic little
lovely who had wowed them in the grand-jury room, but she’d make a good
witness all the same. And when she did her “Shuhmun” duet with Roland
Auburn, he’d have Sherman McCoy cocked and locked. Rent-controlled love
nest, 31 a month. Did he dare call Mr. Hiellig Winter? Why not? He
should interview him in any case…see if he can amplify the relationship
of Maria Ruskin and Sherman McCoy as it pertains to…to…to
rent-controlled love nest, 31 a month.</p>
<p>Sherman walked out of the living room and into the entry gallery and
listened to the sound of his shoes on the solemn green marble. Then he
turned and listened to himself walking across the marble to the library.
In the library there was still one lamp, by a chair, that he hadn’t
turned on. So he turned it on. The entire apartment, both floors, was
blazing with light and throbbing with stillness. His heart was working
away at a good clip. In custody—tomorrow they would put him back in
there! He wanted to cry out, but there was no one in this vast apartment
to cry out to; nor anyone outside it.</p>
<p>He thought of a knife. In the abstract, it was so steely efficient, a
long kitchen knife. But then he tried to enact it in his mind. Where
would he thrust it in? Could he stand it? What if he made a bloody mess
of it? Throw himself out a window. How long before he hit the pavement
from this height? Seconds…interminable seconds…in which he would think
of what? Of what it would do to Campbell, of how he was taking the
coward’s way out. Was he even serious about it? Or was this just
superstitious speculation, in which he presumed if he thought of the
worst he could bear…the actual…back in there? No, he couldn’t bear
it.</p>
<p>He picked up the telephone and called the number in Southampton
again. No answer; there had been no answer all evening, despite the fact
that, according to his mother, Judy and Campbell, Bonita, Miss Lyons,
and the dachshund had left the house on East Seventy-third Street for
Southampton before noon. Had his mother seen the newspaper article? Yes.
Had Judy seen it? Yes. His mother hadn’t even been able to bring herself
to comment on it. It was too sordid to discuss. Then how much worse it
had been for Judy! She hadn’t gone to Southampton at all! She had
decided to disappear, taking Campbell with her…to the Midwest…back to
Wisconsin…A flash of memory…the bleak plains punctuated only by silvery
aluminum water towers, in the shape of modernistic mushrooms, and clumps
of wispy trees…A sigh…Campbell would be better off there than in New
York living with the degraded memory of a father who in fact no longer
existed…a father cut off from everything that defined a human being,
except his name, which was now that of a villainous cartoon that
newspapers, television, and slanderers of every sort were free to make
sport of as they saw fit…Sinking, sinking, sinking, he gave himself up
to ignominy and self-pity…until on about the twelfth ring someone picked
up the telephone.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Judy?”</p>
<p>A pause. “I thought it might be you,” said Judy.</p>
<p>“I suppose you saw the story,” Sherman said.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well, look—”</p>
<p>“Unless you want me to hang up right now, don’t even talk about it.
Don’t even begin.”</p>
<p>He hesitated. “How is Campbell?”</p>
<p>“She’s doing all right.”</p>
<p>“How much does she know?”</p>
<p>“She understands that there’s trouble. She knows something’s up. I
don’t think she knows what. Fortunately, school is over, although it’ll
be bad enough out here.”</p>
<p>“Let me explain—”</p>
<p>“Don’t. I don’t want to listen to your explanations. I’m sorry,
Sherman, but I don’t feel like having my intelligence insulted. Not any
more than it already has been.”</p>
<p>“All right, but I ought to at least tell you what’s going to happen.
I’m going back into custody tomorrow. Back into jail.”</p>
<p>Softly: “Why?”</p>
<p>Why? It doesn’t matter why! I cry out to you—to hold me! But I no
longer have the right! So he merely explained to her the problem of the
increased bail.</p>
<p>“I see,” she said.</p>
<p>He waited a moment, but that was it. “Judy, I just don’t know if I
can do it.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“It was horrible the first time, and I was only inside for a few
hours in a temporary detention pen. This time it’ll be in the Bronx
House of Detention.”</p>
<p>“But only until you post bail.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t know if I can even take a day of it, Judy. After all
this publicity, it’ll be full of people…who have it in for me…I mean,
it’s bad enough even when they don’t know who you are. You can’t imagine
what it’s like—” He stopped. I want to cry out to you! But he had lost
the right.</p>
<p>She picked up the agony in his voice. “I don’t know what to say to
you, Sherman. If I could be with you in some way, I would. But you keep
cutting the ground out from under me. We’ve had this same conversation
before. What do I have left to give you? I just…feel so sorry for you,
Sherman. I don’t know what else to tell you.”</p>
<p>“Judy?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Tell Campbell I love her very much. Tell her…tell her to think of
her father as the person who was here before all this happened. Tell her
that all this does something to you and that you can never be the same
person again.”</p>
<p>Desperately he wanted Judy to ask him what he meant. At even the most
tentative invitation he was ready to pour out everything he felt. But
all she said was:</p>
<p>“I’m sure she’ll always love you, no matter what.”</p>
<p>“Judy?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Do you remember when we used to live in the Village, the way I used
to go off to work?”</p>
<p>“The way you used to go off to work?”</p>
<p>“When I first started working for Pierce andandandand Pierce? The way
I used to give you the raised left fist when I left the apartment, the
Black Power salute?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I remember.”</p>
<p>“You remember why?”</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>
<p>“It was supposed to say that yes, I was going to work on Wall Street,
but my heart and soul would never belong to it. I would use it and rebel
and break with it. You remember all that?”</p>
<p>Judy said nothing.</p>
<p>“I know it didn’t work out that way,” he went on, “but I remember
what a lovely feeling it was. Don’t you?”</p>
<p>Again silence.</p>
<p>“Well, now I’ve broken with Wall Street. Or Wall Street’s broken with
me. I know it’s not the same thing, but in an odd way I feel liberated.”
He stopped, hoping to coax a comment.</p>
<p>Finally Judy said, “Sherman?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“That’s a memory, Sherman, but it’s not alive.” Her voice broke. “All
our memories of that time have been terribly abused. I know you want me
to tell you something else, but I’ve been betrayed and I’ve been
humiliated. I wish I could be something I was a long time ago and help
you, but I can’t.” Snuffling back tears.</p>
<p>“It would help if you could forgive me—if you would give me one last
chance.”</p>
<p>“You asked me that once before, Sherman. All right, I forgive you.
And I’ll ask you again: What does that change?” She was crying
softly.</p>
<p>He had no answer, and that was that.</p>
<p>Afterward, he sat in the brilliant blazing stillness of the library.
He sank back into the swivel chair at his desk. He was aware of the
pressure of the edge of the seat on the underside of his thighs.
Ox-blood Moroccan leather; ,100 just to cover the back and the seat of
this one chair. The library door was open. He looked out into the entry
gallery. There on the marble floor he could see the extravagantly curved
legs of one of the Thomas Hope armchairs. Not a mahogany reproduction
but one of the rosewood originals. Rosewood! The childish joy with which
Judy had discovered her rosewood originals!</p>
<p>The telephone rang. She was calling back! He picked up the receiver
at once.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Ayyyyy, Sherman.” His heart sank again. It was Killian. “I want you
to come on back down here. Got something to show you.”</p>
<p>“You’re still at your office?”</p>
<p>“Quigley’s here, too. We got something to show you.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Just as soon not talk about it”—tawkaboudit—“on the telephone. I
want you to come on down here.”</p>
<p>“All right…I’ll leave right now.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure he could have remained in the apartment another
minute, in any case.</p>
<p>At the old building on Reade Street, the night watchman, who appeared
to be Cypriot or Armenian, was listening to a country-music station on a
huge portable radio. Sherman had to stop and write down his name and the
time on a ledger. In a thick accent the watchman kept joining in the
chorus of the song:</p>
<p>My chin’s up,</p>
<p>My smile’s on,</p>
<p>My heart’s fee-</p>
<p>lin’</p>
<p>down…</p>
<p>Which came out:</p>
<p>My cheen’s op,</p>
<p>Mice a mile’s on,</p>
<p>My hut’s fee-</p>
<p>leen</p>
<p>doan…</p>
<p>Sherman took the elevator up, walked through the dingy stillness of
the corridor, and came to the door with the incised plastic sign that
read DERSHKIN, BELLAVITA, FISHBEIN andandandand SCHLOSSEL. For an
instant he thought of his father. The door was locked. He rapped on it,
and after five or ten seconds Ed Quigley opened it.</p>
<p>“Ayyyyy! Come on in!” said Quigley. His dour face was all lit up.
Beaming is the word. All of a sudden he was Sherman’s warmest pal. Half
a chuckle bubbled out of him as he led Sherman toward Killian’s
office.</p>
<p>Killian was standing inside with the smile of the cat that ate the
canary. On his desk was a large tape machine that was obviously from the
higher and more sophisticated reaches of the Audio-Visual Kingdom.</p>
<p>“Ayyyyyyyyyy!” said Killian. “Have a seat. Get a good grip on
yourself. Wait’ll you hear this.”</p>
<p>Sherman sat down beside the desk. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“You tell me,” said Killian. Quigley stood next to Killian, looking
at the machine and fidgeting like a schoolboy onstage to receive a
prize. “I don’t want to get your hopes up too high over this thing,”
said Killian, “because there’s a couple very serious problems with it,
but you’ll find it interesting.”</p>
<p>He pushed something on the machine, and a stream of low static began.
Then a man’s voice:</p>
<p>“I knew it. I knew it at the time. We should have reported it
immediately.” For the first second or so he didn’t recognize it. then it
sank in. My own voice! It continued: “I can’t believe I’m—I can’t
believe we’re in this situation.”</p>
<p>A woman’s voice: “Well, it’s too late now, Sherman.” Shuhmun. “That’s
spilt milk.”</p>
<p>The entire scene—the fear, the tension, the very atmosphere of
it—flooded through Sherman’s nervous system…In her hideaway the evening
the first article about Henry Lamb appeared in The City Light…HONOR
STUDENT’S MOM: COPS SIT ON HIT’N’RUN…He could see the headline itself on
top of the oak pedestal table…</p>
<p>His voice: “Just…tell what actually happened.”</p>
<p>Her voice: “That’ll sound wonderful. Two boys stopped us and tried to
rob us, but you threw a tire at one of them, and I drove outta there
like a…a…hot-rodder, but I didn’t know I hit anybody.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s exactly what happened, Maria.”</p>
<p>“And who’s gonna believe it?…”</p>
<p>Sherman looked at Killian. Killian had a tight little smile on his
face. He raised his right hand as if to caution Sherman to keep
listening and not speak yet. Quigley kept his eyes fixed on the magical
machine. His lips were pursed to hold back the broad grin he felt he was
due.</p>
<p>Soon the Giant arrived. “You live here?”</p>
<p>His own voice: “I said we don’t have time for this.” He sounded
terribly snooty and precious. All over again he felt the humiliation of
that moment, the dreadful feeling that he was about to be forced into a
masculine duel, very likely physical, that he could not possibly
win.</p>
<p>“You don’t live here, and she don’t live here. What you doing
here?”</p>
<p>The snooty fellow: “That’s not your concern! Now, be a good fellow
and leave!”</p>
<p>“You don’t belong here. Okay? We got a real problem.”</p>
<p>Then Maria’s voice…the squabbling…a tremendous crack, as the chair
breaks and the Giant hits the floor…his ignominious retreat…Maria’s
whoops of laughter…</p>
<p>Finally her voice saying: “Germaine pays only 31 a month, and I pay
her 50. It’s rent-controlled. They’d love to get her out of here.”</p>
<p>Soon the voices stopped…and Sherman remembered, felt, the fitful
session on the bed…</p>
<p>When the tape had played out, Sherman said to Killian, “My God,
that’s astounding. Where did that come from?”</p>
<p>Killian looked at Sherman but pointed his right index finger at
Quigley. So Sherman looked at Quigley. It was the moment Quigley had
been waiting for.</p>
<p>“As soon as you told me where she told you about her rent scam, I
knew it. I just fucking knew it. Those lunatics. This Hiellig Winter
ain’t the first one. The voice-activated tapes. So I went straight over
there. This character has microphones hidden in the intercom boxes
inside the apartments. The recorder’s down in the cellar in a locked
closet.”</p>
<p>Sherman stared at the man’s suddenly radiant face. “But why would he
even bother?”</p>
<p>“To get the tenants out!” said Quigley. “Half the people in these
rent-controlled apartments ain’t in there legally. Halfa them are
scamming, just like your friend there. But proving it in court is
another thing. So this lunatic’s taping every conversation in the joint
with the voice-activated tape. Believe me, he ain’t the first one,
either.”</p>
<p>“But…isn’t that illegal?”</p>
<p>“Illegal,” said Quigley with great joy, “it’s so fucking illegal it
ain’t even funny! It’s so fucking illegal, if he walked in that door
right now, I’d say, ‘Hi, I took your fucking tape. Whaddaya thinka
that?’ And he’d say, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about,’ and walk
away like a nice boy. But I’m telling you, these maniacs are
crazed.”</p>
<p>“And you just took it? How did you even get in there?”</p>
<p>Quigley shrugged with consummate smugness. “That’s no big deal.”</p>
<p>Sherman looked at Killian. “Christ…then maybe…if that’s on tape, then
maybe…Right after the thing happened, Maria and I went back to her
apartment and we talked the whole thing over, everything that happened.
If that’s on tape—that would be…fantastic!”</p>
<p>“It ain’t there,” said Quigley. “I listened to miles a this stuff. It
don’t go back that far. He must erase it every now and then and record
right over it, so he don’t have to keep buying new tapes.”</p>
<p>His spirits soaring, Sherman said to Killian, “Well, maybe this is
enough!”</p>
<p>Quigley said, “Incidentally, you ain’t the only visitor she receives
in that joint.”</p>
<p>Killian broke in: “Yeah, well, that’s of historical interest at this
point. Now, here’s the thing, Sherman. I don’t want you to get your
hopes up too high over this. We got two serious problems. The first one
is that she don’t come right out and say she hit the kid and you didn’t.
What she says is indirect. Half the time, it sounds like she might be
going along with what you’re saying. Nevertheless, it’s a good weapon.
It’s certainly enough to create doubt in a jury. She certainly seems to
be concurring with your theory that this was a robbery attempt. But we
got another problem, and to be honest with you, I don’t know what the
hell we can do about it. There’s no way I can get this tape into
evidence.”</p>
<p>“You can’t? Why not?”</p>
<p>“Like Ed says, this is a totally illegal tape. This crazy guy Winter
could go to jail for doing this. There is absolutely no way that a
surreptitious, illegal tape can be used as evidence in a court of
law.”</p>
<p>“Well then, why did you wire me? That’s a surreptitious tape. How
could that be used?”</p>
<p>“It’s surreptitious but not illegal. You’re entitled to record your
own conversations, secretly or not. But if it’s somebody else’s
conversation, it’s illegal. If this lunatic landlord Winter was
recording his own conversations, there’d be no problem.”</p>
<p>Sherman stared at Killian with his mouth open, his just-hatched hopes
already crushed. “But that’s not right! Here’s…vital evidence! They
can’t suppress vital evidence on a technicality!”</p>
<p>“I got news for you, bro. They can. They would. What we gotta do is
think of some way to use this tape to get somebody to give us some
legitimate testimony. Like if there’s some way we can use this to make
your friend Maria come clean. You got any bright ideas?”</p>
<p>Sherman thought for a moment. Then he sighed and looked off past the
two men. It was all too preposterous. “I don’t know how you’d even get
her to listen to the goddamned thing.”</p>
<p>Killian looked at Quigley. Quigley shook his head. The three of them
were quiet.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” said Sherman. “Let me see that tape.”</p>
<p>“See it?” said Killian.</p>
<p>“Yes. Give it to me.”</p>
<p>“Take it off the machine?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Sherman held out his hand.</p>
<p>Quigley rewound it and took it off the machine very gingerly, as if
it were a precious piece of hand-blown glass. He gave it to Sherman.</p>
<p>Sherman held it in both hands and stared at it. “I’ll be damned,” he
said, looking up at Killian. “It’s mine.”</p>
<p>“Whaddaya mean, it’s yours?”</p>
<p>“This is my tape. I made it.”</p>
<p>Killian looked at him quizzically, as if searching out a joke.
“Whaddaya mean, you made it?”</p>
<p>“I wired myself up that night, because this article in The City Light
had just come out and I figured I might need some verification of what
actually happened. What we just listened to—that’s the tape I made that
night. This is my tape.”</p>
<p>Killian’s mouth was open. “What are you saying?”</p>
<p>“I’m saying I made this tape. Who’s going to say I didn’t? This tape
is in my possession. Right? Here it is. I made this tape in order to
have an accurate record of my own conversation. Tell me, Counselor,
would you say this tape is admissible in a court of law?”</p>
<p>Killian looked at Quigley. “Jesus H. Fucking Christ.” Then he looked
at Sherman. “Let me get this straight, Mr. McCoy. You’re telling me you
wired yourself and made this tape of your conversation with
Mrs. Ruskin?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Is it admissible?”</p>
<p>Killian looked at Quigley, smiled, then looked back. “It’s entirely
possible, Mr. McCoy, entirely possible. But you gotta tell me something.
Just how did you make this tape? What kind of equipment did you use? How
did you tape yourself? I think if you want the court to admit this
evidence, you better be able to account for everything you did, from A
to Z.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Sherman, “I’d like to hear Mr. Quigley here guess how I
did it. He seems knowledgeable in this area. I’d like to hear him
guess.”</p>
<p>Quigley looked at Killian.</p>
<p>“Go ahead, Ed,” said Killian, “take a guess.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Quigley, “if it was me, I’d get me a Nagra 2600,
voice-activated, and I’d…” He proceeded to outline in great detail just
how he would use the fabled Nagra machine and wire himself and make sure
he secured the highest-quality recording of such a conversation.</p>
<p>When he was through, Sherman said, “Mr. Quigley, you are truly
knowledgeable in this area. Because you know what? That is exactly what
I did. You didn’t leave out a single step.” Then he looked at Killian.
“There you have it. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what I think,” Killian said slowly. “You surprise the
hell outta me. I didn’t think you had it in you.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t, either,” said Sherman. “But something’s gradually dawned
on me over the past few days. I’m not Sherman McCoy anymore. I’m
somebody else without a proper name. I’ve been that other person ever
since the day I was arrested. I knew something…something fundamental had
happened that day, but I didn’t know what it was at first. At first I
thought I was still Sherman McCoy, and Sherman McCoy was going through a
period of very bad luck. Over the last couple of days, though, I’ve
begun to face up to the truth. I’m somebody else. I have nothing to do
with Wall Street or Park Avenue or Yale or St. Paul’s or Buckley or the
Lion of Dunning Sponget.”</p>
<p>“The Lion of Dunning Sponget?” asked Killian.</p>
<p>“That’s the way I’ve always thought of my father. He was a ruler, an
aristocrat. And maybe he was, but I’m not related to him anymore. I’m
not the person my wife married or the father my daughter knows. I’m a
different human being. I exist down here now, if you won’t be offended
by me putting it that way. I’m not an exceptional client of Dershkin,
Bellavita, Fishbein andandandand Schlossel. I’m standard issue. Every
creature has its habitat, and I’m in mine right now. Reade Street and
161st Street and the pens—if I think I’m above it, I’m only kidding
myself, and I’ve stopped kidding myself.”</p>
<p>“Ayyyyy, wait a minute,” said Killian. “It ain’t that bad yet.”</p>
<p>“It’s that bad,” said Sherman. “But I swear to you, I feel better
about it now. You know the way they can take a dog, a house pet, like a
police dog that’s been fed and pampered all its life, and train it to be
a vicious watchdog?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of it,” said Killian.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen it done,” said Quigley. “I saw it done when I was on the
force.”</p>
<p>“Well, then you know the principle,” said Sherman. “They don’t alter
that dog’s personality with dog biscuits or pills. They chain it up, and
they beat it, and they bait it, and they taunt it, and they beat it some
more, until it turns and bares its fangs and is ready for the final
fight every time it hears a sound.”</p>
<p>“That’s true,” said Quigley.</p>
<p>“Well, in that situation dogs are smarter than humans,” said Sherman.
“The dog doesn’t cling to the notion that he’s a fabulous house pet in
some terrific dog show, the way the man does. The dog gets the idea. The
dog knows when it’s time to turn into an animal and fight.”</p>
