<h4 id="the-last-of-the-great-smokers">12. The Last of the Great
Smokers</h4>
<p>After a fitful sleep, Sherman reached Pierce andandandand Pierce at
eight o’clock. He was exhausted, and the day hadn’t begun. The bond
trading room had a hallucinatory quality. The appalling glare on the
harbor side…the writhing silhouettes…the radium-green numbers skidding
across the faces of an infinite number of terminals…the young Masters of
the Universe, so utterly unknowing, bawling at the electric
doughnuts:</p>
<p>“I’ll pay two!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but what about the when-issued?”</p>
<p>“Down two ticks!”</p>
<p>“Bullshit! You can’t turn off a fuse!”</p>
<p>Even Rawlie, poor dispirited Rawlie, was on his feet, his telephone
at his ear, his lips moving a mile a minute, drumming his desktop with a
pencil. Young Arguello, lord of the pampas, was rocked back in his chair
with his thighs akimbo, the telephone at his ear, his moiré suspenders
blazing away, and a big grin on his young gigolo face. He had scored a
smashing coup yesterday in Japan with the Treasuries. The whole trading
room was talking about it. Grinning grinning grinning grinning, the
greaseball lounged in triumph.</p>
<p>Sherman had a craving to go to the Yale Club and take a steam bath
and lie down on one of those leather-top tables and get a good hot
hammering massage and go to sleep.</p>
<p>On his desk was a message, marked urgent, to call Bernard Levy in
Paris.</p>
<p>Four computer terminals away, Felix was working on the right shoe of
a gangling, obnoxious young whiz named Ahlstrom, just two years out of
Wharton. Ahlstrom was on the telephone. Gobble, gobble, gobble, eh,
Mr. Ahlstrom? Felix—The City Light. It would be on the stands by now. He
wanted to see it, and he dreaded seeing it.</p>
<p>Scarcely even aware what he was doing, Sherman put the telephone to
his ear and dialed the Trader T number in Paris. He leaned over the desk
and supported himself with both elbows. As soon as Felix was through
with the hot young Ahlstrom, he would call him over. Some part of his
mind was listening when the French doughnut, Bernard Levy, said:</p>
<p>“Sherman, after we spoke yesterday, I talked it over with New York,
and everyone agrees you’re right. There’s no point waiting.”</p>
<p>Thank God.</p>
<p>“But,” Bernard continued, “we can’t go ninety-six.”</p>
<p>“Can’t go ninety-six?”</p>
<p>He was hearing portentous words…and yet he couldn’t concentrate…The
morning newspapers, the Times, the Post, the News, which he had read in
the taxi on the way downtown, contained rehashes of the City Light
story, plus more statements from this black man, Reverend Bacon.
Ferocious denunciations of the hospital where the boy still lay in a
coma. For a moment Sherman had taken heart. They were blaming it all on
the hospital! Then he realized this was wishful thinking. They would
blame…She was driving. If they closed in, finally, if all else failed,
she was driving. It was her. He clung to that.</p>
<p>“No, ninety-six is no longer on the table,” said Bernard. “But we’re
ready at ninety-three.”</p>
<p>“Ninety-three!”</p>
<p>Sherman sat up straight. This could not be true. Certainly in the
next moment Bernard would tell him he’d made a slip. He’d say
ninety-five at the worst. Sherman had paid ninety-four. Six hundred
million bonds at ninety-four! At ninety-three Pierce andandandand Pierce
would lose six million dollars.</p>
<p>“Surely you didn’t say ninety-three!”</p>
<p>“Ninety-three, Sherman. We think it’s a very fair price. In any
event, that’s the offer.”</p>
<p>“Christ almighty…I’ve got to think for a second. Listen, I’ll call
you back. Will you be there?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll call you right back.”</p>
<p>He hung up and rubbed his eyes. Christ! There must be a way to pull
this out. He had let himself get rattled with Bernard yesterday. Fatal!
Bernard had detected panic in his voice and had pulled back. Get
yourself together! Regroup! Think this thing out! There’s no way you can
let it collapse after all this! Call him back and be yourself, best
producer of Pierce andandandand Pierce!—Master of the…He lost heart. The
more he urged himself on, the more nervous he became. He looked at his
watch. He looked at Felix. Felix was just rising from the shoe of the
hot child, Ahlstrom. He waved him over. He took his money clip out of
his pants pocket, sat down, put it between his knees to hide it,
withdrew a five-dollar bill and slipped it into an interoffice envelope,
then stood up as Felix walked over.</p>
<p>“Felix, there’s five dollars in there. Go downstairs and get me a
City Light, will you? The change is yours.”</p>
<p>Felix looked at him and then gave him a funny smile and said, “Yeah,
okay, but you know, last time they keep me waiting down there at the
stand, and the elevator don’t come, and I lose a lotta time. It’s fifty
floors down there. Cost me a lotta time.” He didn’t budge.</p>
<p>It was outrageous! He was claiming that five dollars to go fetch a
thirty-five-cent newspaper was cutting into his profit margin as a
shoeshine man! He had the nerve to gouge him—ahhhhhhhh…that was it. Some
kind of street radar told him that if he was hiding the newspaper in an
envelope, then it was contraband. It was smuggling. It was desperation,
and desperate people pay money.</p>
<p>Scarcely able to contain his fury Sherman dug into his pocket and
came up with another five dollars and thrust it at the black man, who
took it, gave him a fastidiously bored look, and went off with the
envelope.</p>
<p>He dialed Paris again.</p>
<p>“Bernard?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Sherman. I’m still working on it. Give me another fifteen or twenty
minutes.”</p>
<p>A pause. “All right.”</p>
<p>Sherman hung up and looked toward the great rear window. The
silhouettes bobbed and jerked about in insane patterns. If he was
willing to come up to ninety-five…In no time the black man was back. He
handed him the envelope without a word or a fathomable expression.</p>
<p>The envelope was fat with the tabloid. It was as if there were
something alive in there. He put it under his desk, where it gnashed and
thrashed about.</p>
<p>If he threw part of his own profit into it…He began jotting down the
figures on a piece of paper. The sight of them—meaningless! Attached to
nothing! He could hear himself breathing. He picked up the envelope and
headed for the men’s room.</p>
<p>Inside the cubicle, the pants of his two-thousand-dollar Savile Row
suit gracing the bare toilet seat, his New andandandand Lingwood
cap-toed shoes pulled back up against the china toilet bowl, Sherman
opened up the envelope and withdrew the newspaper. Every crackle of the
paper accused him. The front page…CHINATOWN GHOST VOTER SCANDAL…of no
earthly interest…He opened it up…Page 2…Page 3…a picture of a Chinese
restaurant owner…It was at the bottom of the page:</p>
<p>Secret Printout</p>
<p>In Bronx Hit’N’Run</p>
<p>Above the headline, in smaller white letters upon a black bar: New
Bombshell in Lamb Case. Below the headline, on another black bar, it
said: A CITY LIGHT Exclusive. The story was by the same Peter
Fallow:</p>
<p>Declaring “I’m fed up with the foot-dragging,” a source within the
Division of Motor Vehicles yesterday provided The City Light with a
computer printout narrowing down to 124 the number of vehicles that
might have been involved in last week’s hit-and-run maiming of Bronx
honor student Henry Lamb.</p>
<p>The source, who has worked with police on similar cases in the past,
said: “They can check out 124 vehicles in a few days. But first they
have to want to commit the manpower. When the victim is from the
projects, they don’t always want to.”</p>
<p>Lamb, who lives with his widowed mother in the Edgar Allan Poe
Towers, a Bronx housing project, lies in an apparently irreversible
coma. Before losing consciousness, he was able to give his mother the
first letter—R—and five possibilities for the second letter—E, F, B, R,
P—of the license plate of the luxurious Mercedes-Benz that ran him down
on Bruckner Boulevard and sped off.</p>
<p>Police and the Bronx District Attorney’s Office have objected that
almost 500 Mercedes-Benzes registered in New York State have plates
beginning with those letters, too many to justify a vehicle-by-vehicle
check in a case where the only known witness, Lamb himself, may never
regain consciousness.</p>
<p>But The City Light’s DMV source said: “Sure, there are 500
possibilities, but only 124 that are likely. Bruckner Boulevard, where
this young man was run down, is not exactly a tourist attraction. It
stands to reason that the vehicle belongs to someone in New York City or
Westchester. If you go on that assumption—and I’ve seen the cops do it
in other cases—that narrows it down to 124.”</p>
<p>The revelation prompted new demands by a black leader, Rev. Reginald
Bacon, for a full-scale investigation of the incident.</p>
<p>“If the police and the District Attorney won’t do it, we’ll do it
ourselves,” he said. “The power structure lets this brilliant young
man’s life be destroyed and then just yawns. But we’re not going to
stand for that. We’ve got the printout now, and we’ll track down those
cars ourselves if we have to.”</p>
<p>Sherman’s heart jumped inside his chest.</p>
<p>Lamb’s South Bronx neighborhood was described as “up in arms” and
“seething with fury” over the handling of his injuries and the alleged
reluctance of authorities to move on the case.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Health and Hospital Administration said an
“internal investigation” was under way. Police and the office of Bronx
District Attorney Abe Weiss said their investigations were “continuing.”
They refused comment on the narrowing down of the number of vehicles,
but a DMV spokesman, Ruth Berkowitz, referring to the material obtained
by The City Light, said: “The unauthorized release of ownership data in
a sensitive case such as this is a serious and very irresponsible breach
of departmental policy.”</p>
<p>That was it. Sherman sat on the toilet seat staring at the block of
type. Closing the noose! But the police weren’t paying any attention to
it…Yes, but suppose this…this Bacon…and a bunch of seething black
people, up in arms, started checking the cars themselves…He tried to
picture it…Too gross for his imagination…He looked up at the gray-beige
door of the toilet cubicle…The air hinge of the door to the men’s room
was opening. Then a door opened just a couple of cubicles away. Slowly
Sherman closed the newspaper and folded it over and slipped it back
inside the interoffice envelope. Ever so slowly he rose from the toilet
seat; ever so quietly he opened the cubicle door; ever so stealthily he
stole across the men’s-room floor, while his heart raced on ahead.</p>
<p>Once more in the bond trading room, he picked up the telephone. Must
call Bernard. Must call Maria. He tried to put a businesslike expression
on his face. Personal calls from the bond trading room of Pierce
andandandand Pierce were much frowned upon. He dialed her apartment on
Fifth. A woman with a Spanish accent answered. Mrs. Ruskin not at home.
He called the hideaway, dialing the numbers with great deliberation. No
answer. He rocked back in his chair. His eyes focused in the
distance…the glare, the flailing silhouettes, the roar…</p>
<p>The sound of someone’s fingers snapping over his head…He looked up.
It was Rawlie, snapping his fingers.</p>
<p>“Wake up. Thinking’s not allowed around here.”</p>
<p>“I was just…” He didn’t bother to finish, because Rawlie had already
passed by.</p>
<p>He hunched over his desk and looked at the radium-green numbers
trucking across the screens.</p>
<p>Just like that he decided to go see Freddy Button.</p>
<p>What would he tell Muriel, the sales assistant? He would tell her he
was going to see Mel Troutman at Polsek andandandand Fragner about the
Medicart Fleet issue…That was what he would tell her…and the notion
sickened him. One of the Lion’s maxims was “A lie may fool someone else,
but it tells you the truth: you’re weak.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t remember Freddy Button’s telephone number. It had been
that long since he had called him. He looked it up in his address
book.</p>
<p>“This is Sherman McCoy. I’d like to speak to Mr. Button.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. McCoy, he’s with a client. Can he call you back?”</p>
<p>Sherman paused. “Tell him it’s urgent.”</p>
<p>The secretary paused. “Hold on.”</p>
<p>Sherman was hunched over his desk. He looked down at his feet…the
envelope with the newspaper…No! Suppose she called in to Freddy over an
intercom, and another lawyer, someone who knew his father, heard her say
it…“Sherman McCoy, urgent”…</p>
<p>“Excuse me! Wait a second! Never mind—are you there?” He was yelling
into the telephone. She was gone.</p>
<p>He stared down at the envelope. He scribbled some figures on a piece
of paper, so as to look busy and businesslike. The next thing he heard
was the ever-suave, ever-nasal voice of Freddy Button.</p>
<p>“Sherman. How are you? What’s up?”</p>
<p>On the way out, Sherman told his lie to Muriel and felt cheap,
sordid, and weak.</p>
<p>Like a lot of other old-line, well-fixed Protestant families in
Manhattan, the McCoys had always made sure that only other Protestants
ministered to their private affairs and their bodies. By now, this took
some doing. Protestant dentists and accountants were rare creatures, and
Protestant doctors weren’t easy to find.</p>
<p>Protestant lawyers were still plentiful, however, at least on Wall
Street, and Sherman had become a client of Freddy Button the same way he
had joined the Knickerbocker Greys, the kiddie cadet corps, as a boy.
His father had arranged it. When Sherman was a senior at Yale, the Lion
thought it was time he made out a will, as an orderly and prudent part
of growing up. So he passed him along to Freddy, who was then a young
and newly made partner at Dunning Sponget. Sherman had never had to
worry about whether Freddy was a good lawyer or not. He had gone to him
to be tidy: for wills, redrafted when he married Judy and when Campbell
was born, for contracts when he bought the apartment on Park Avenue and
the house in Southampton. The purchase of the apartment had made Sherman
think twice. Freddy knew he had borrowed .8 million to buy it, and that
was more than he wanted his father (technically Freddy’s partner) to
know. Freddy had kept his counsel. But in an obscene business like this,
with the newspapers screaming, was there some reason why—some
procedure—some practice of the firm—something that would cause the
matter to be circulated to other partners—to the aging Lion himself?</p>
<p>Dunning Sponget andandandand Leach occupied four floors of a
skyscraper on Wall Street, three blocks from Pierce andandandand Pierce.
When it was built, it had been the very latest in the 1920s Moderne
style, but now it had the grimy gloom that was typical of Wall Street.
The Dunning Sponget offices resembled Pierce andandandand Pierce’s. In
both cases modern interiors had been caked with eighteenth-century
English paneling and stocked with eighteenth-century English furniture.
This was lost on Sherman, however. To him everything about Dunning
Sponget was as venerable as his father.</p>
<p>To his relief, the receptionist didn’t recognize him or his name. Of
course, by now the Lion was nothing more than one of the wrinkled old
partners who infested the corridors for a few hours each day. Sherman
had just taken a seat in an armchair when Freddy Button’s secretary,
Miss Zilitsky, appeared. She was one of those women who look fiftyish
and loyal. She led him down a silent hall.</p>
<p>Freddy, tall, lank, elegant, charming, smoking away, stood waiting
for him at the door of his office.</p>
<p>“Hel-lo, Sherman!” A plume of cigarette smoke, a magnificent smile, a
warm handshake, a charming display of pleasure at the very sight of
Sherman McCoy. “My goodness, my goodness, how are you? Have a seat. How
about some coffee? Miss Zilitsky!”</p>
<p>“No, thanks. Not for me.”</p>
<p>“How’s Judy?”</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>“And Campbell?” He always remembered Campbell’s name, which Sherman
appreciated, even in his present state.</p>
<p>“Oh, she’s thriving.”</p>
<p>“She’s at Taliaferro now, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Yes. How did you know that? Did my father mention it?”</p>
<p>“No, my daughter Sally. She graduated from Taliaferro two years ago.
Absolutely loved it. Keeps up with everything. She’s at Brown now.”</p>
<p>“How does she like Brown?” Jesus Christ, why am I even bothering to
ask? But he knew why. Freddy’s thick, fast, meaningless current of charm
swept you up. Helpless, you said the usual.</p>
<p>It was a mistake. Freddy was immediately off on an anecdote about
Brown and coed dorms. Sherman didn’t bother listening. To make a point,
Freddy flipped his long hands upward in a languid, effeminate gesture.
He was always talking about families, his family, your family, other
people’s families, and he was a homosexual. No doubt about it. Freddy
was about fifty years old, six feet four or more, slender, awkwardly put
together but elegantly dressed in the English “drape” style. His limp
blond hair, now dulled by a rising tide of gray, was slicked back in the
1930s fashion. Languidly he settled into his chair, across the desk from
Sherman, talking as he did so, and smoking. He took a deep draft of the
cigarette and let the smoke curl out of his mouth and drained it up into
his nostrils in two thick columns. This was once known as French
inhaling and was so known to Freddy Button, the last of the Great
Smokers. He blew smoke rings. He French-inhaled and blew large smoke
rings and then blew speedy little smoke rings through the large ones.
From time to time he held his cigarette not between his first two
fingers but between his thumb and forefinger, upright, like a candle.
Why was it that homosexuals smoked so much? Perhaps because they were
self-destructive. But the word self-destructive was the outer limit of
Sherman’s familiarity with psychoanalytical thought, and so his eyes
began to drift. Freddy’s office was done, the way Judy talked about
doing apartments. It looked like something from one of those abominable
magazines…burgundy velvet, oxblood leather, burled wood, brass and
silver bibelots…All at once Freddy and his charm and his taste were
supremely annoying.</p>
<p>Freddy must have sensed his irritation, because he broke off his
story and said, “Well—you said something happened with you and your
car.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, you can read about it, Freddy.” Sherman opened his
attaché case and took out the Pierce andandandand Pierce interoffice
envelope and withdrew the copy of The City Light and folded it back to
page 3 and handed it across the desk. “The piece at the bottom of the
page.”</p>
<p>Freddy took the newspaper with his left hand, and with his right he
put the cigarette out in a Lalique ashtray with a lion’s head sculpted
on the rim. He reached toward a white silk handkerchief that debouched
carelessly, voluptuously, from the breast pocket of his jacket and
withdrew a pair of horn-rimmed glasses. Then he put the newspaper down
and put the glasses on with both hands. From his inside breast pocket he
took out a silver-and-ivory cigarette case, opened it, and removed a
cigarette from under a silver clip. He tamped it on the outside of the
case, lit it with a slender fluted silver lighter, then picked up the
newspaper and commenced reading; or reading and smoking. With his eyes
fixed on the newspaper, he brought the cigarette to his lips in the
candle position, between his thumb and forefinger, took a deep drag,
twirled his fingers and—bingo!—the cigarette popped out between the
knuckles of his forefinger and middle finger. Sherman was amazed. How
had he done it? Then he was furious. He turns into a tobacco acrobat—in
the middle of my crisis!</p>
<p>Freddy finished the article and laid the cigarette in the Lalique
ashtray with great care and took off his glasses and tucked them back
beneath the lustrous silk handkerchief and picked up the cigarette again
and took another profound drag on it.</p>
<p>Sherman, spitting the words out: “That’s my car you just read
about.”</p>
<p>The anger in his voice startled Freddy. Gingerly, as if tiptoeing, he
said: “You have a Mercedes with a license number that starts with R?
R-something?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.” With a hiss.</p>
<p>Freddy, befuddled: “Well…why don’t you tell me what happened?”</p>
<p>Not until Freddy said those words did Sherman realize that…he was
dying to! He was dying to confess—to someone! Anyone! Even this nicotine
Turnvereiner, this homosexual fop who was a partner of his father! He
had never looked at Freddy with such clarity before. He could see him.
Freddy was the sort of willowy wand of charm into whose office a Wall
Street firm of the Dunning Sponget magnitude shunted all the widows and
legacies, such as himself, who were presumed to have more money than
problems. Yet he was the only confessor available.</p>
<p>“I have a friend named Maria Ruskin,” he said. “She’s the wife of a
man named Arthur Ruskin, who’s made a lot of money doing God knows
what.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of him,” said Freddy, nodding.</p>
<p>“I’ve—” Sherman stopped. He didn’t know quite how to word it. “I’ve
been seeing a bit of Mrs. Ruskin.” He pursed his lips and stared at
Freddy. The unspoken message was “Yes; precisely; it’s the usual sordid
case of cheap lust.”</p>
<p>Freddy nodded.</p>
<p>Sherman hesitated again, then plunged on into the details of the
automobile ride into the Bronx. He studied Freddy’s face for signs of
disapproval or—worse!—enjoyment! He detected nothing but a friendly
concern punctuated by smoke rings. Sherman no longer resented him,
however. Such relief! The vile poison was gushing out! My confessor!</p>
<p>As he told his tale, he was aware of something else: an irrational
joy. He was the main character in an exciting story. All over again he
took pride—stupid pride!—in having fought in the jungle and triumphed.
He was on stage. He was the star! Freddy’s expression had progressed
from friendly and concerned…to entranced…</p>
<p>“And so here I am,” Sherman said, finally. “I can’t figure out what
to do. I wish I’d gone straight to the police when it happened.”</p>
<p>Freddy leaned back in his chair and looked away and took a drag on
his cigarette, then turned back and gave Sherman a reassuring smile.</p>
<p>“Well, from what you’ve told me, you’re not responsible for the
injury to the young man.” As he spoke, inhaled smoke came out of his
mouth in faint jets. Sherman hadn’t seen anyone do that for years. “You
may have some obligation, as the owner of the vehicle, to report the
incident, and there may be the question of leaving the scene of the
accident. I’d have to look up the statute. I suppose they could develop
an assault charge, for throwing the tire, but I don’t think it would
hold up, since you clearly had reason to believe your life was in
danger. In fact, this really isn’t as unusual a circumstance as you
might think. Do you know Clinton Danforth?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“He’s the chairman of the board of Danco. I represented him in a suit
against the Triple A. The Automobile Club of New York was the actual
entity, I believe. He and his wife—you’ve never seen Clinton?”</p>
<p>Seen him? “No.”</p>
<p>“Very proper. Looks like one of those capitalists the cartoonists
used to draw, with the silk topper. Anyway, one night Clinton and his
wife were driving home—” Now he was off on some story about the car of
this illustrious client of his breaking down in Ozone Park, Queens.
Sherman sifted the words for some little nugget of hope. Then it dawned
on him that this was merely Freddy’s charm reflex at work. The essence
of the social charmer was having a story, preferably with Fat Names in
it, to fit every subject. In a quarter century of law practice, this was
probably the only case Freddy ever handled that even touched the streets
of New York.</p>
<p>“…a black man with a police dog on a leash—”</p>
<p>“Freddy.” Sherman, hissing again. “I don’t care about your fat friend
Danforth.”</p>
<p>“What?” Freddy, befuddled and shocked.</p>
<p>“I haven’t got time for it. I have a problem.”</p>
<p>“Oh, listen. Please. Forgive me.” Freddy spoke softly, warily; also
sadly, the way you might talk to a lunatic who was heating up. “Really,
I was only trying to show you—”</p>
<p>“Never mind showing me. Put out that cigarette and tell me what you
think.”</p>
<p>Without taking his eyes off Sherman’s face, Freddy put out the
cigarette in the Lalique ashtray. “All right, I’ll tell you exactly what
I think.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean to be abrupt, Freddy, but Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>“I know, Sherman.”</p>
<p>“Please smoke if you want to, but let’s stick to the point.”</p>
<p>The hands fluttered up to indicate that smoking wasn’t important.</p>
<p>“All right,” said Freddy, “here’s what I see. I think you’re in the
clear on the major issue here, which is the personal injury. You might
conceivably be at risk of a felony charge for leaving the scene and not
notifying the police. As I say, I’ll research that. But I think that’s
not too serious a proposition, assuming we can establish the sequence of
events as you’ve outlined them to me.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘establish’?”</p>
<p>“Well, the thing that worries me about this newspaper story is that
it’s so far off from the facts as you’ve given them to me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I know it!” said Sherman. “There’s no mention of the other—the
other fellow, the one who first approached me. There’s not one word
about the barricade or even the ramp. They’re saying it happened on
Bruckner Boulevard. It didn’t happen on Bruckner Boulevard or any other
boulevard. They’re making out that this boy, this…honor student…this
black saint…was walking across the street, minding his own business, and
some white bigot in a ‘luxury car’ comes along and runs him down and
keeps going. It’s lunacy! They keep calling it a ‘luxury car,’ and all
it is, is a Mercedes. Christ, a Mercedes is like a Buick used to
be.”</p>
<p>Freddy’s arch of the eyebrows said, “Not precisely.” But Sherman
pressed on.</p>
<p>“Let me ask you this, Freddy. Does the fact that”—he started to say
“Maria Ruskin” but didn’t want to appear to be anxious to lay off
blame—“the fact that I wasn’t driving when the boy was hit, does that
put me in the clear legally?”</p>
<p>“So far as the injury to the young man is concerned, it seems to me.
Again, I’d want to review the statutes. But let me ask you something.
What is your friend Mrs. Ruskin’s version of what happened?”</p>
<p>“Her version?”</p>
<p>“Yes. How does she say this fellow got hit? Does she say she was
driving?”</p>
<p>“Does she say she was driving? She was driving.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but let’s suppose she sees some possibility of a felony charge
if she says she was driving.”</p>
<p>Sherman was speechless for a moment. “Well, I can’t imagine she
would…” Lie was the word he meant to say but didn’t, for in fact it was
not utterly beyond the realm of the imagination. The notion shocked him.
“Well…all I can tell you is that every time we’ve talked about it, she’s
said the same thing. She’s always used the expression ‘After all, I was
the one who was driving.’ When I first suggested going to the police,
right after it happened, that was what she said. ‘I was the one who was
driving. So it’s up to me to decide.’ I mean, I guess anything can
happen, but…God almighty.”</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to sow doubt, Sherman. I just want to make sure you
know that she may be the only person who can corroborate your version of
this thing—and at some risk to herself.”</p>
<p>Sherman sank back in his chair. The voluptuous warrior who had fought
beside him in the jungle and then, glistening, made love to him on the
floor…</p>
<p>“So if I go to the police now,” he said, “and I tell them what
happened, and she doesn’t back me up, then I’m worse off than I am
now.”</p>
<p>“It’s a possibility. Look, I’m not suggesting she won’t back you up.
I just want you to be aware of…where you stand.”</p>
<p>“What do you think I should do, Freddy?”</p>
<p>“Who have you talked to about this?”</p>
<p>“No one. Just you.”</p>
<p>“How about Judy?”</p>
<p>“No. Least of all Judy, if you want to know the truth.”</p>
<p>“Well, for the time being you shouldn’t talk to anybody about it,
probably not even Judy, unless you feel compelled to. Even then, you
should impress upon her the need to keep absolutely quiet about it.
You’d be amazed at how the things you say can be picked up and turned
against you, if someone wants to do it. I’ve seen it happen too many
times.”</p>
<p>Sherman doubted that, but he merely nodded.</p>
<p>“In the meantime, with your permission, I’m going to talk this
situation over with another lawyer I know, a fellow who works in this
area all the time.”</p>
<p>“Not somebody here at Dunning Sponget—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Because I’d hate to have this thing kicking around the halls here at
this goddamned place.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, it’s another firm entirely.”</p>
<p>“What firm?”</p>
<p>“It’s called Dershkin, Bellavita, Fishbein andandandand
Schlossel.”</p>
<p>The torrent of syllables was like a bad smell.</p>
<p>“What kind of firm is that?”</p>
<p>“Oh, they have a general practice, but they’re best known for their
work in criminal law.”</p>
<p>“Criminal law?”</p>
<p>Freddy smiled faintly. “Don’t worry. Criminal lawyers help people who
aren’t criminals, too. We’ve used this fellow before. His name is Thomas
Killian. He’s very bright. He’s about your age. He went to Yale, as a
matter of fact, or at least he went to the law school. He’s the only
Irishman who ever graduated from the Yale Law School, and he’s the only
graduate of the Yale Law School who ever practiced criminal law. I’m
exaggerating, of course.”</p>
<p>Sherman sank back into the chair again and tried to let the term
criminal law sink in. Seeing that he was once more The Lawyer with the
upper hand, Freddy took out the silver-and-ivory case, eased a Senior
Service from under the silver clip, tamped it, lit up, and inhaled with
profound satisfaction.</p>
<p>“I want to see what he thinks,” said Freddy, “particularly since,
judging by this newspaper story, this case is taking on political
overtones. Tommy Killian can give us a much better reading on that than
I can.”</p>
<p>“Dershkin, Something andandandand Schloffel?”</p>
<p>“Dershkin, Bellavita, Fishbein andandandand Schlossel,” said Freddy.
“Three Jews and an Italian, and Tommy Killian is an Irishman. Let me
tell you something, Sherman. The practice of law gets very specialized
in New York. It’s as if there are a lot of little…clans…of trolls…I’ll
give you an example. If I was being sued in an automobile negligence
case, I wouldn’t want anybody at Dunning Sponget representing me. I’d go
to one of these lawyers on lower Broadway who don’t do anything else.
They’re the absolute bottom of the barrel of the legal profession.
They’re all Bellavitas and Schlossels. They’re crude, coarse, sleazy,
unappetizing—you can’t even imagine what they’re like. But that’s who
I’d go to. They know all the judges, all the clerks, the other
lawyers—they know how to make the deals. If somebody named Bradshaw or
Farnsworth showed up from Dunning Sponget andandandand Leach, they’d
freeze him out. They’d sabotage him. It’s the same way with criminal
law. The criminal lawyers aren’t exactly the bout en train, either, but
in certain cases you’ve got to use them. Given that situation, Tommy
Killian is a very good choice.”</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ,” said Sherman. Of all the things Freddy had said, only
the words criminal law had stuck.</p>
<p>“Don’t look so gloomy, Sherman!”</p>
<p>Criminal law.</p>
<p>When he returned to the bond trading floor at Pierce andandandand
Pierce, the sales assistant, Muriel, gave him a dour look.</p>
<p>“Where were you, Sherman? I’ve been trying to reach you.”</p>
<p>“I was—” He started to repeat the lie, with improvements, but the
look on her face told him it would only make things worse. “Okay, what’s
wrong?”</p>
<p>“An issue came in just after you left, 200 million Fidelity Mutuals.
So I called over to Polsek and Fragner, but you weren’t there, and they
said they weren’t even expecting you. Arnold’s not happy, Sherman. He
wants to see you.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go see him.” He turned away and started toward the desk.</p>
<p>“Wait a second,” said Muriel. “This fellow in Paris has been trying
to get you, too. He’s called about four times. Mr. Levy. Said you were
supposed to call him back. Said to tell you ninety-three is it. ‘Final,’
he said. He said you’d know what he meant.”</p>
<p>13.The Day-Glo Eel</p>
<p>Kramer and the two detectives, Martin and Goldberg, arrived at the
Edgar Allan Poe Towers in an unmarked Dodge sedan about 4:15. The
demonstration was scheduled for five o’clock. The housing project had
been designed during the Green Grass era of slum eradication. The idea
had been to build apartment towers upon a grassy landscape where the
young might gambol and the old might sit beneath shade trees, along
sinuous footpaths. In fact, the gamboling youth broke off, cut down, or
uprooted the shade-tree seedlings during the first month, and any old
person fool enough to sit along the sinuous footpaths was in for the
same treatment. The project was now a huge cluster of grimy brick towers
set on a slab of cinders and stomped dirt. With the green wooden slats
long gone, the concrete supports of the benches looked like ancient
ruins. The ebb and flow of the city, caused by the tides of human labor,
didn’t cause a ripple at the Edgar Allan Poe Towers, where the
unemployment rate was at least 75 percent. The place was no livelier at
4:15 P.M. than it was at noon. Kramer couldn’t spy a soul, except for a
small pack of male teenagers scurrying past the graffiti at the base of
the buildings. The graffiti looked halfhearted. The grimy brick, with
all its mortar gulleys, depressed even the spray-can juvies.</p>
<p>Martin slowed the car down to a crawl. They were on the main drag,
out in front of Building A, where the demonstration was supposed to be
held. The block was empty, except for a gangling teenager out in the
middle of the street working on the wheel of a car. The car, a red
Camaro, was nosed into a parking space along the curb. The rear end
stuck out into the street. The boy wore black jeans, a black T-shirt,
and striped sneakers. He was sitting on his haunches with a lug wrench
in his hands.</p>
<p>Martin stopped the car barely ten feet from him and shut off the
engine. The boy, still on his haunches, stared at the Dodge. Martin and
Goldberg were in the front seat, and Kramer was in the back. Martin and
Goldberg just sat there, looking straight ahead. Kramer couldn’t imagine
what they were doing. Then Martin got out. He was wearing a tan
windbreaker, a polo shirt, and a pair of cheap-looking gray pants. He
walked over to the boy and stood over him and said, “Whaddaya doing?” He
didn’t say it nicely, either.</p>
<p>Baffled, the boy said, “Nothing. Fixing a hubcap.”</p>
<p>“Fixing a hubcap?” asked Martin, his voice sopping with
insinuation.</p>
<p>“Yehhhhhhh…”</p>
<p>“You always park like this, out inna middle a the fucking
street?”</p>
<p>The boy stood up. He was well over six feet tall. He had long
muscular arms and powerful hands, one of which was holding the lug
wrench. His mouth open, he stared down at Martin, who suddenly looked
like a dwarf. Martin’s narrow shoulders seemed nonexistent under the
windbreaker. He wore no badge or any other police insignia. Kramer
couldn’t believe what he was watching. Here they were in the South
Bronx, thirty minutes away from a demonstration protesting the
shortcomings of White Justice, and Martin throws down the gauntlet to a
black youth twice his size with a lug wrench in his hand.</p>
<p>Martin cocked his head to one side and stared into the boy’s
incredulous face without so much as a blink. The boy apparently found it
exceedingly strange, too, because he didn’t move or say anything,
either. Now he glanced at the Dodge and found himself staring into the
big meaty face of Goldberg, with its slits for eyes and its drooping
black mustache. Then he looked at Martin again and put on a brave and
angry face.</p>
<p>“Just fixing a hubcap, champ. Got nothing to do with you.”</p>
<p>Before he got to the word you, he was already moving away from Martin
with what was supposed to pass for a saunter. He opened the door of the
Camaro and tossed the wrench in the back seat and sauntered around to
the driver’s side and got in and started up the car and maneuvered it
out of the parking place and headed off. The Camaro gave a great throaty
roar. Martin returned to the Dodge and got behind the wheel.</p>
<p>“I’m putting you in for a community relations commendation, Marty,”
said Goldberg.</p>
<p>“Kid’s lucky I didn’t run a check,” said Martin. “Besides, that’s the
only parking place on the fucking block.”</p>
<p>And they wonder why people hate them in the ghetto, thought Kramer.
Yet in that very moment he marveled…marveled! He, Kramer, was big enough
and strong enough to have fought the boy with the wrench, and
conceivably he might have beaten him. But he would have had to do that.
If he had confronted the boy, it would have reached the fighting stage
immediately. But Martin knew from the beginning that it wouldn’t. He
knew that something in his eyes would make the boy sense Irish Cop Who
Don’t Back Off. Of course, it didn’t hurt to have Goldberg sitting there
looking like the Original Cruel Thug, and it didn’t hurt to have a .38
under your jacket. Nevertheless, Kramer knew he couldn’t have done what
this outrageous little featherweight champion of the breed had done, and
for the five hundredth time in his career as an assistant district
attorney in the Bronx he paid silent homage to that most mysterious and
coveted of male attributes, Irish machismo.</p>
<p>Martin parked the Dodge in the space the boy had vacated, and the
three of them sat back and waited.</p>
<p>“Bullshit reigns,” said Martin.</p>
<p>“Hey, Marty,” said Kramer, proud to be on a first-name basis with
this paragon, “you guys find out who gave that printout to The City
Light?”</p>
<p>Without turning around, Martin said, “One a da brothers,” giving an
Irish rendition of a black accent. He turned his head slightly and
twisted his lips to indicate it was about what you would expect and that
there was nothing to be done about it.</p>
<p>“You gonna check out all 124 cars or whatever it is?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Weiss has been on the C.O.’s case all day.”</p>
<p>“How long will it take?”</p>
<p>“Three or four days. He’s assigned six men. Bullshit reigns.”</p>
<p>Goldberg turned around and said to Kramer: “What’s with Weiss? Does
he really believe this shit he reads in the newspapers or what?”</p>
<p>“That’s all he believes,” said Kramer. “And anything with a racial
angle drives him crazy. Like I told you, he’s up for reelection.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but what makes him think we’re gonna find witnesses at this
demonstration, which is pure bullshit?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But that’s what he told Bernie.”</p>
<p>Goldberg shook his head. “We don’t even have a location where the
goddamned thing happened. You realize that? Marty and me been up and
down Bruckner Boulevard and I’ll be goddamned if we can establish where
it happened. That’s another thing the kid forgot to tell his mother when
he came up with the bullshit license plate, where it’s fucking
supposeda’ve happened.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of that,” said Kramer, “how would a kid in the Poe project
even know what a Mercedes looks like?”</p>
<p>“Oh, they know that,” said Martin, without turning his head. “The
pimps and wiseguys drive the Mercedes.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Goldberg. “They won’t look at a Cadillac anymore. You
see these kids with these things, these hood ornaments from the
Mercedes, hanging around their necks.”</p>
<p>“If a kid up here wants to think up a bullshit car for a bullshit
story,” said Martin, “the Mercedes is the first one he’s gonna think of.
Bernie knows that.”</p>
<p>“Well, Weiss is all over Bernie’s case, too,” said Kramer. He looked
around some more. The huge project was so quiet it was eerie. “You sure
this is the right place, Marty? There’s nobody here.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” said Martin. “They’ll be here. Bullshit reigns.”</p>
<p>Pretty soon a bronze-colored passenger van pulled into the block and
stopped up ahead of them. About a dozen men got out. All of them were
black. Most of them wore blue work shirts and dungarees. They appeared
to be in their twenties or early thirties. One of them stood out because
he was so tall. He had an angular profile and a large Adam’s apple and
wore a gold ring in one ear. He said something to the others, and they
began pulling lengths of lumber out of the van. These turned out to be
the shafts of picket signs. They stacked the signs on the sidewalk. Half
the men leaned up against the van and began talking and smoking
cigarettes.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen that tall asshole somewhere,” said Martin.</p>
<p>“I think I seen him, too,” said Goldberg. “Oh, shit, yes. He’s one a
Bacon’s assholes, the one they call Buck. He was at that thing on Gun
Hill Road.”</p>
<p>Martin sat up straight. “You’re right, Davey. That’s the same
asshole.” He stared across the street at the man. “I’d really love to…”
He spoke in a dreamy fashion. “Please, you asshole, please just do one
stupid thing, you asshole…I’m getting out.”</p>
<p>Martin got out of the Dodge and stood on the sidewalk and very
ostentatiously began rolling his shoulders and arms about, like a
prizefighter loosening up. Then Goldberg got out. So Kramer got out,
too. The demonstrators across the street began staring at them.</p>
<p>Now one of them, a powerfully built young man in a blue work shirt
and blue jeans, came walking across the street with a cool Pimp Roll and
approached Martin.</p>
<p>“Yo!” he said. “You from the TV?”</p>
<p>Martin put his chin down and shook his head no, very slowly, in a way
that was pure menace.</p>
<p>The black man measured him with his eyes and said, “Then where you
from, Jack?”</p>
<p>“Jump City, Agnes,” said Martin.</p>
<p>The young man tried a scowl, and then he tried a smile, and he got
nothing with either one but a face full of Irish contempt. He turned
around and walked back across the street and said something to the
others, and the one named Buck stared at Martin. Martin stared back with
a pair of Shamrock lasers. Buck turned his head and gathered four or
five of the others around him in a huddle. From time to time they stole
glances at Martin.</p>
<p>This Mexican standoff had been going on for a few minutes when
another van arrived. Some young white people got out, seven men and
three women. They looked like college students, with the exception of
one woman with long wavy gray-blond hair.</p>
<p>“Yo, Buck!” she sang out. She went up to the tall man with the gold
earring and held out both her hands and smiled broadly. He took her
hands, although not all that enthusiastically, and said, “Hey, how you
doing, Reva?” The woman pulled him toward her and kissed him on one
cheek and then on the other.</p>
<p>“Oh, give me a fucking break,” said Goldberg. “That skank.”</p>
<p>“You know her?” asked Kramer.</p>
<p>“Know who she is. She’s a fucking Communist.”</p>
<p>Then the white woman, Reva, turned around and said something, and a
white man and a white woman went back to the van and hauled out more
placards.</p>
<p>Presently a third van arrived. Nine or ten more white people got out,
male and female, most of them young. They hauled a big roll of cloth out
of the van and unfurled it. It was a banner. Kramer could make out the
words GAY FIST STRIKE FORCE AGAINST RACISM.</p>
<p>“What the hell’s that?” he said.</p>
<p>“That’s the lesbos and the gaybos,” said Goldberg.</p>
<p>“What are they doing here?”</p>
<p>“They’re at alla these things. They must like the fresh air. They
really get it on.”</p>
<p>“But what’s their interest in the case?”</p>
<p>“Don’t ask me. The unity of the oppressed, they call it. Any of these
groups need bodies, they’ll show up.”</p>
<p>So now there were about two dozen white and a dozen black
demonstrators, lolling about, chatting and assembling placards and
banners.</p>
<p>Now a car arrived. Two men got out. One of them carried two cameras
on straps around his neck and a saddlebag with the printed logo THE CITY
LIGHT taped to it. The other was a tall man in his thirties, with a long
nose and blond hair that flowed from a narrow widow’s peak. His fair
complexion was splotched with red. He wore a blue blazer of an unusual
and, to Kramer’s eyes, foreign cut. For no apparent reason he suddenly
lurched to his left. He appeared to be in agony. He stood stock-still on
the sidewalk, tucked a spiral notebook under his left arm, closed his
eyes, and pressed both hands to his temples, massaged them for a long
time, then opened his eyes and winced and blinked and looked all
about.</p>
<p>Martin began to laugh. “Look at that face. Looks like a working vat a
rye mash. Guy’s so hung over, he’s bleeding into his squash.”</p>
<p>Fallow lurched to his left again. He kept listing to port. Something
was seriously wrong with his vestibular system. It was absolutely
poisonous, this one, as if his brain were wrapped in membranous strings,
like the strings of the membranes of an orange, and each contraction of
his heart tightened the strings, and the poison was squeezed into his
system. He had had throbbing headaches before, but this was a toxic
headache, poisonous in the extreme—</p>
<p>Where were the crowds? Had they come to the wrong place? There seemed
to be a handful of black people and about twenty white students, just
standing about. A huge banner said GAY FIST. Gay Fist? He had dreaded
the thought of the noise and the commotion, but now he was worried about
the silence.</p>
<p>On the sidewalk, just ahead of him, was the same tall black man with
the gold earring who had driven him and Vogel up here two days ago.
Vogel. He closed his eyes. Vogel had taken him to dinner at Leicester’s
last night as a kind of celebration (payment?) for the article…He had a
vodka Southside…then another one…The snout of the beast!—lit up by a
radium-blue flare!…Tony Stalk and Caroline Heftshank came over and sat
down, and Fallow tried to apologize for what had happened with her young
friend, Chirazzi, the artist, and Caroline gave him a strange smile and
said he shouldn’t worry about that, and he had another vodka Southside,
and Caroline kept drinking Frascati and shrieking to Britt-Withers in a
very silly way, and finally he came over, and she unbuttoned his shirt
and pulled the hair on his chest so hard he swore, and then Fallow and
Caroline were in Britt-Withers’s office upstairs, where Britt-Withers
had a watery-eyed bull terrier on a chain, and Caroline kept looking at
Fallow with her strange smile, and he tried to unbutton her blouse, and
she laughed at him and patted him on the bottom, contemptuously, but it
made him feel crazy, and—a ripple!—the beast stirred in the icy
depths!—and she curved her finger and beckoned, and he knew she was
mocking him, but he walked across the office anyway, and there was a
machine—something about a machine and a radium-blue flare—thrashing!
heading for the surface!—a rubbery flap—he could almost see it
now—almost!—and she was mocking him, but he didn’t care, and she kept
pressing something, and the radium blue flared from inside, and there
was a grinding hum, and she reached down and she picked it up—she showed
him—he could almost see it—no holding it back—it broke through the
surface and looked at him straight down its filthy snout—and it was like
a woodblock outlined in a radium aura against a black ground, and the
beast kept staring at him down its snout, and he wanted to open his eyes
to drive it away, but he couldn’t, and the bull terrier started
growling, and Caroline no longer looked at him, even to show her
contempt, and so he touched her on the shoulder, but she was suddenly
all business, and the machine kept grinding and humming and grinding and
humming and flaring in radium blue, and then she had a stack of pictures
in her hand, and she ran down the stairs to the restaurant, and he kept
keeling to one side, and then a terrible thought came to him. He ran
down the stairs, which were in a tight spiral, and that made him
dizzier. On the floor of the restaurant, so many roaring faces and
boiling teeth!—and Caroline Heftshank was standing near the bar showing
the picture to Cecil Smallwood and Billy Cortez, and then there were
pictures all over the place, and he was thrashing through the tables and
the people grabbing for the pictures—</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and tried to keep them open. The Bronx, the Bronx,
he was in the Bronx. He walked toward the man with the gold earring,
Buck. He kept listing to port. He felt dizzy. He wondered if he had
suffered a stroke.</p>
<p>“Hello,” he said to Buck. He meant it to be cheery, but it came out
as a gasp. Buck looked at him without a trace of recognition. So he
said: “Peter Fallow, from The City Light.”</p>
<p>“Oh, hey, how you doing, bro.” The black man’s tone was agreeable but
not enthusiastic. The author of the brilliant scoops in The City Light
had expected enthusiasm. The black man resumed his conversation with the
woman.</p>
<p>“When does the demonstration begin?” said Fallow.</p>
<p>Buck looked up distractedly. “Soon’s Channel 1 gets here.” By the
time he reached the word here, he was once again looking at the
woman.</p>
<p>“But where are the people?”</p>
<p>He stared at Fallow and paused, as if trying to figure him out.
“They’ll be here…soon’s Channel I gets here.” He used the sort of voice
you use for someone who is blameless but dense.</p>
<p>“I see,” said Fallow, who couldn’t see at all. “When, uh, as you say,
Channel 1 arrives, uh…what takes place then?”</p>
<p>“Give the man the release, Reva,” said Buck. An intense
demented-looking white woman dug down into a big vinyl tote bag on the
sidewalk by her feet and handed him two pieces of paper stapled
together. The paper, which was Xeroxed—Xeroxed! Radium-blue! The
snout!—bore the letterhead of the American People’s Alliance. A
headline, typed in capital letters, said: THE PEOPLE DEMAND ACTION IN
THE LAMB CASE.</p>
<p>Fallow started to read it, but the words ran together like goulash in
front of his face. Just then a bouncy young white man materialized. He
was wearing an appallingly tasteless tweed jacket.</p>
<p>“Neil Flannagan from the Daily News,” said the bouncy man. “What’s
going on?”</p>
<p>The woman named Reva dug out another press release. Mr. Neil
Flannagan, like Fallow himself, was accompanied by a photographer. The
bouncy Mr. Flannagan had nothing to say to Fallow, but the two
photographers fell in with one another at once. Fallow could hear them
complaining about the assignment. Fallow’s photographer, an odious
little man who wore a cap, kept using the expression “crock a shit.”
That was all that American newspaper photographers seemed to talk about
with any relish whatsoever, their displeasure at being asked to leave
the office and take pictures. The dozen demonstrators, meantime, were
clearly unmoved by the presence of representatives of two of the city’s
tabloids, The City Light and the Daily News. They continued to lounge
about the van, their rage, if any, about the injustices wrought upon
Henry Lamb successfully contained.</p>
<p>Fallow tried once more to read the press release but soon gave up. He
looked about. The Poe Towers remained peaceful; abnormally so, given
their size. On the other side of the street stood three white men. There
was a little man in a tan windbreaker, a big porcine man with a drooping
mustache wearing a warm-up jacket, and a balding man with blunt features
wearing a poorly made gray suit and a Yank striped necktie. Fallow
wondered who they were. But mainly he wanted to sleep. He wondered if he
could sleep standing up, like a horse.</p>
<p>Presently he heard the woman, Reva, say to Buck: “I think that’s
them.” Both of them looked down the street. The demonstrators came to
life.</p>
<p>Coming up the street was a large white van. On its side, in huge
letters, was the inscription THE LIVE 1. Buck, Reva, and the
demonstrators began walking toward it. Mr. Neil Flannagan, the two
photographers, and, finally, Fallow himself tagged along behind them.
Channel 1 had arrived.</p>
<p>The van came to a stop, and out of the passenger’s side of the front
seat came a young man with a great fluffy head of dark curly hair and a
navy blazer and tan pants.</p>
<p>“Robert Corso,” said Reva, reverently.</p>
<p>The side doors of the van slid open, and two young men in jeans and
sweaters and running shoes stepped out. The driver stayed at the wheel.
Buck hurried forward.</p>
<p>“Yo-o-o-o-o! Robert Corso! How you doing, man!” Suddenly Buck had a
smile that lit up the street.</p>
<p>“Okay!” said Robert Corso, trying to sound enthusiastic in return.
“Okay.” He obviously had no idea who this black man with the gold
earring was.</p>
<p>“What you want us to do?” asked Buck.</p>
<p>The bouncy young man broke in: “Hey, Corso, Neil Flannagan, Daily
News.”</p>
<p>“Oh, hi.”</p>
<p>“What you want us to—”</p>
<p>“Where you guys been?”</p>
<p>“What you want us to—”</p>
<p>Robert Corso looked at his watch. “It’s only 5:10. We’re going on
live at 6:00. We got plenty a time.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but I got a seven o’clock deadline.”</p>
<p>“What you want us to do?” Buck insisted.</p>
<p>“Well…hey!” said Robert Corso. “I don’t know. What would you do if I
wasn’t here?”</p>
<p>Buck and Reva looked at him with funny little grins on, as if he must
be joking.</p>
<p>“Where are Reverend Bacon and Mrs. Lamb?” said Robert Corso.</p>
<p>“In Mrs. Lamb’s apartment,” said Reva. Fallow took it badly. No one
had bothered to apprise him of this fact.</p>
<p>“Hey, whenever you say,” said Buck.</p>
<p>Robert Corso shook his great fluffy head. He muttered, “Well, hell, I
can’t run this thing for you.” Then, to Buck: “It’ll take us a little
while to set up. I guess the sidewalk’s the best place. I want to get
the buildings in the background.”</p>
<p>Buck and Reva went to work. They began gesturing and giving
instructions to the demonstrators, who now went back toward their van
and began picking up the picket signs, which were stacked on the
sidewalk. A few people had begun drifting over from the Poe Towers to
the scene.</p>
<p>Fallow gave up on Buck and Reva and approached Robert Corso. “Excuse
me,” he said. “I’m Peter Fallow, from The City Light. Did I hear you say
that Reverend Bacon and Mrs. Lamb are here?”</p>
<p>“Fallow?” said Robert Corso. “You’re the one who wrote the stories?”
He held out his hand and shook Fallow’s with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid so.”</p>
<p>“You’re the reason we’re up at this goddamned place?” He said it with
an appreciative smile.</p>
<p>“Sorry about that.” Fallow felt a glow inside. This was the sort of
tribute he expected all along, but he hadn’t expected to get it from a
TV person.</p>
<p>Robert Corso turned serious. “Do you think Bacon is really on the
level about this one? Well, obviously you do.”</p>
<p>“You don’t?” asked Fallow.</p>
<p>“Aw hell, you never know with Bacon. He’s fairly outrageous. But when
I interviewed Mrs. Lamb, I was impressed, to tell you the truth. She
seems like a good person to me—she’s bright, she’s got a steady job, she
has a nice, neat little apartment. I was impressed. I don’t know—I
believe her. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“You’ve already interviewed her? I thought you were getting ready to
interview her here.”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, but that’s just for the wraparound. We’ll wrap around
live at six o’clock.”</p>
<p>“Wrap around live…I don’t believe I know about wrapping around
live.”</p>
<p>The irony was lost on the American, however. “Well, what we do is, I
came up here with a crew this afternoon, after your story came out.
Thanks a lot for that! I really love assignments in the Bronx. Anyway,
we interviewed Mrs. Lamb and we interviewed a couple of the neighbors
and we got some footage of Bruckner Boulevard and the place where the
boy’s father was killed and all that stuff, and some stills of the boy.
So we’ve already got most of the story on tape. It’ll run for about two
minutes, and what we do now is, we go on live during the demonstration,
and then we’ll roll the tape, and then we’ll cut back in live and wrap
it up with a live segment. That’s wrapping it up live.”</p>
<p>“But what will you show? There’s no one here but this lot. Most of
them are white.” Fallow motioned toward Buck and Reva.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry. There’ll be plenty of people here as soon as our
telescope goes up.”</p>
<p>“Your telescope.”</p>
<p>“Our remote transmitter.” Robert Corso looked toward the van. Fallow
followed his eyes. He could see the two crewmen in blue jeans
inside.</p>
<p>“Your remote transmitter. By the way, where are your
competitors?”</p>
<p>“Our competitors?”</p>
<p>“The other television stations.”</p>
<p>“Oh, we were promised an exclusive.”</p>
<p>“Really? By whom?”</p>
<p>“Bacon, I guess. That’s what I don’t like about the setup. Bacon’s so
fucking manipulative. He’s got a pipeline to my producer, Irv Stone. You
know Irv?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I don’t.”</p>
<p>“You’ve heard of him.”</p>
<p>“Ummm, actually I haven’t.”</p>
<p>“He’s won a lot of awards.”</p>
<p>“Ummm.”</p>
<p>“Irv’s—well, Irv’s all right, but he’s one of these old bastards who
was a campus radical back in the 1960s, when they were having the
antiwar demonstrations and everything. He thinks Bacon’s this romantic
leader of the people. He’s a fucking operator, is what I think. But
anyway, he promised Irv an exclusive if he’d put it on live at six
o’clock.”</p>
<p>“That’s very cozy. But why would he want to do that? Why wouldn’t he
want all the stations to be here?”</p>
<p>“Because that way he might get nothing out of it. I bet you every day
there’s twenty or thirty demonstrations going on in New York, and
they’re all competing for coverage. This way he knows we’ll play it big.
If we go to the trouble of sending out the remote van, and if we go
live, and if we think we have an exclusive, then it’ll go at the top of
the news. It’ll be live, and it’ll be a big deal, and tomorrow 5 and 7
and 2 and the rest of them’ll figure they better cover the story,
too.”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Fallow. “Hmmmm…But how can he guarantee you, as you
say, an exclusive? What will prevent the other, uh, channels from coming
here?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, except that he won’t tell them the time or the place.”</p>
<p>“He wasn’t so considerate of me, was he?” said Fallow. “I notice the
Daily News seems to have the time and the place.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Robert Corso, “but you’ve had exclusives for two days
now. Now he has to let the other newspapers in on it.” He paused. His
handsome young fluffy-haired American face looked melancholy all of a
sudden. “But you do think it’s a legitimate story, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, absolutely,” Fallow said.</p>
<p>Corso said, “This Henry Lamb is—was—is a nice kid. An honor student,
no police record, he’s quiet, the neighbors seem to like him—isn’t that
the way it strikes you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no question about it,” said the creator of the honor
student.</p>
<p>Reva approached them. “We’re all set. Just say when.”</p>
<p>Robert Corso and Fallow looked to the sidewalk, where the three dozen
pickets were now lined up informally. They held the shafts of the picket
signs on their shoulders, like wooden guns.</p>
<p>Robert Corso said, “Bacon’s ready? And Mrs. Lamb?”</p>
<p>Reva said, “Well, you tell me or Buck. Reverend Bacon doesn’t want to
come down here with Mrs. Lamb and just stand around. But he’s
ready.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Robert Corso. He turned toward THE LIVE 1 van. “Hey,
Frank! You guys ready?”</p>
<p>From inside the van: “Just about!”</p>
<p>A heavy whirring noise began. Out of the top of the van rose a
silvery shaft, a cylinder. Attached to the top of the shaft was a
Day-Glo-orange banner or bunting. No, it was a cable, a heavily
insulated cable, wide but flat, like an electric eel. The screaming
orange eel was wrapped around the shaft in a spiral. The silvery shaft
and the orange spiral kept rising, rising, rising. The shaft was in
sections, like a telescope, and it went up, up, up, and the van whirred
and whirred and whirred.</p>
<p>People began emerging from the silent towers of the project, which
was silent no longer. A boiling noise, the boiling noise of many voices,
rose from the blasted heath. Here they came, men, women, packs of boys,
young children, their eyes fastened to the ascending silver-and-orange
lance and its Radiation Orange banner.</p>
<p>Now the shaft had risen two and a half stories above the street, with
its orange eel wrapped around it. The street and the sidewalk were empty
no longer. A huge good-natured crowd gathered around for the beano. A
woman yelled out, “Robert Corso!” Channel 1! The fluffy-haired man who
would be on TV!</p>
<p>Robert Corso looked toward the pickets, who had formed a lazy oval on
the sidewalk and were beginning to march. Buck and Reva stood by. Buck
had a bullhorn in his hand. He kept his eyes pinned on Robert Corso.
Then Robert Corso looked toward his crewmen. His cameraman stood six
feet away. The camera looked very small next to the van and the
tremendous shaft, but the crowd was spellbound by its deep, deep
cataract eye. The camera wasn’t even on, but every time the cameraman
turned to talk to the soundman, and the great eye swung about, a ripple
went through the crowd, as if the machine had its own invisible kinetic
momentum.</p>
<p>Buck looked at Robert Corso and raised one hand, palm up, which
asked, “When?” Robert Corso shrugged and then wearily pointed his finger
toward Buck. Buck lifted the bullhorn to his mouth and yelled: “Whadda
we want?”</p>
<p>“Justice!” chanted the three dozen pickets. Their voices sounded
terribly thin against the backdrop of the crowd and the towers of the
project and the splendid silver lance of THE LIVE 1.</p>
<p>“WHADDA WE GET?”</p>
<p>“Ra-cism!”</p>
<p>“WHADDA WE WANT?”</p>
<p>“Jus-tice!” They were a little louder, but not much.</p>
<p>“WHADDA WE GET?”</p>
<p>“Ra-cism!”</p>
<p>Six or eight boys in their early teens were shoving and bumping one
another and laughing, struggling to get into the camera’s line of
vision. Fallow stood off to one side of the star, Robert Corso, who was
holding his microphone but saying nothing. The man with the high-tech
horn moved closer to the oval line of pickets, and the crowd heaved in
response. The signs and banners came bobbing by. WEISS JUSTICE IS WHITE
JUSTICE…LAMB: SLAUGHTERED BY INDIFFERENCE…LIBERATE JOHANNE BRONX…GAY
FIST STRIKE FORCE AGAINST RACISM…THE PEOPLE CRY OUT: AVENGE HENRY!…QUIT
STALLING, ABE!…GAY AND LESBIAN NEW YORK DEMAND JUSTICE FOR OUR BROTHER
HENRY LAMB…CAPITALISM+RACISM=“LEGALIZED“ MURDER…HIT’N’RUN’N’LIE TO THE
PEOPLE!…ACTION NOW!…</p>
<p>“Whadda we want?”</p>
<p>“Jus-tice!”</p>
<p>“Whadda we get?”</p>
<p>“Ra-cism!”</p>
<p>Buck turned the bullhorn toward the crowd. He wanted to get their
voices into the act.</p>
<p>“WHADDA WE WANT?”</p>
<p>Nothing came back. In the best of moods, they watched the show.</p>
<p>Buck answered his own question: “JUS-TICE.”</p>
<p>“WHADDA WE GET?”</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>“RA-CISM!”</p>
<p>“OKAY! WHADDA WE WANT?”</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>“BROTHERS AND SISTERS,” said Buck, the red bullhorn in front of his
face. “Our brother, our neighbor, Henry Lamb, he was struck down…by a
hit-and-run driver…and the hospital…they don’t do nothing for him…and
the cops and the D.A.…they can’t be bothered…Henry’s at death’s door…and
they don’t care…Henry’s an honor student…and they say, ‘So what?’…’cause
he’s poor, he’s from the project…’cause he’s black…So why are we here,
brothers and sisters?…To make Chuck do the right thing!”</p>
<p>That brought some appreciative laughter from the crowd.</p>
<p>“To get justice for our brother, Henry Lamb!” Buck continued. “Okay.
SO WHADDA WE WANT?”</p>
<p>“Justice,” said voices from the crowd.</p>
<p>“AND WHADDA WE GET?”</p>
<p>Laughter and stares.</p>
<p>The laughter came from six or eight boys in their early teens who
were shoving and bumping one another, struggling to occupy a position
just behind Buck. That would put them in a direct line with the eye of
the camera, whose mesmerizing red light was now on.</p>
<p>“Who’s Chuck?” asked Kramer.</p>
<p>“Chuck is Charlie,” said Martin, “and Charlie is The Man, and
speaking for The Man, I’d like to get my hands on that big
shitcake.”</p>
<p>“You see those signs?” asked Kramer. “WEISS JUSTICE IS WHITE JUSTICE
AND QUIT STALLING, ABE!?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“If they show that on TV, Weiss’s gonna fucking freak out.”</p>
<p>“ ’S’already freaked out, if you ask me,” said Goldberg. “Look at
this bullshit.”</p>
<p>From where Kramer, Goldberg, and Martin stood, the scene across the
street was a curious little theater-in-the-round. The play concerned the
Media. Beneath the towering spire of a TV van, three dozen figures, two
dozen of them white, marched about in a small oval, carrying signs.
Eleven people, two of them black, nine of them white, attended them, in
order to bring their thin voices and felt-tip-marker messages to a city
of seven million: a man with a bullhorn, a woman with a tote bag, a
fluffy-haired TV announcer, a cameraman and a soundman attached to the
van by umbilical cords, two technicians visible inside the open sliding
doors of the van, the van driver, two newspaper photographers and two
newspaper reporters with notebooks in their hands, one of them still
lurching to port every now and again. An audience of two or three
hundred souls was packed in around them, enjoying the spectacle.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Martin, “time to start talking to witnesses.” He started
walking across the street, toward the crowd.</p>
<p>“Hey, Marty,” said Goldberg. “Be cool. Okay?”</p>
<p>Took the words right out of Kramer’s mouth. This was not the ideal
setting for trying to demonstrate Irish machismo to the world. He had a
horrible vision of Martin taking the bullhorn from the man with the
earring and trying to stuff it down his throat before the assembled
residents of the Poe Towers.</p>
<p>The three of them, Kramer, Martin, and Goldberg, were halfway across
the street when the pickets and the crowd suddenly got religion. They
began making a real racket. Buck was bellowing something on the
bullhorn. The cameraman’s high-tech proboscis was weaving this way and
that. From somewhere a tall figure had appeared, a man with a black suit
and a terrific stiff white collar and a black necktie with white
stripes. With him was a small black woman wearing a dark dress with a
luster, like silk or satin. It was Reverend Bacon and Mrs. Lamb.</p>
<p>Sherman was halfway across the marble floor of the entry gallery when
he saw Judy, sitting in the library. She was sitting in the wing chair,
with a magazine on her lap, watching television. She looked up at him.
What was that look? It was surprise, not warmth. If she would give him
even a hint of warmth, he would go straight in and—and tell her! Oh yes?
Tell her what? Tell her…about the debacle in the office at least, about
the way Arnold Parch had talked to him and, worse, looked at him! The
others, too! As if…He avoided forming in words what they must have
thought of him. His disappearance, the collapse of the gold-backed bond
scheme—and then tell her the rest, too? Had she by now seen a newspaper
article about a Mercedes…RF…But there was not a hint of warmth. There
was only surprise. It was six o’clock. He hadn’t been home this early in
a long time…There was only surprise in that sad thin face with the
corona of soft brown hair.</p>
<p>He kept walking toward her. He would go in the library, anyway. He
would sit down in the other armchair and watch television, too. That had
been silently agreed upon. The two of them could sit together in the
library and read or watch television. That way they could go through the
frozen motions of being a family, for Campbell’s benefit as much as
anything else, without having to talk.</p>
<p>“Daddy!”</p>
<p>He turned around. Campbell was coming toward him from the door that
led to the kitchen. She had a glorious smile on her face. It nearly
broke his heart.</p>
<p>“Hello, sweetheart.” He put his hands under her armpits and swept her
up off the floor and wrapped his arms around her. She put her arms
around his neck and her legs around his waist, and she said, “Daddy!
Guess what I made!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“A rabbit.”</p>
<p>“You did? A rabbit?”</p>
<p>“I’ll show you.” She started wriggling, to get down.</p>
<p>“You’ll show me?” He didn’t want to see her rabbit, not now, but the
obligation to seem enthusiastic overwhelmed him. He let her slither to
the floor.</p>
<p>“Come on!” She took him by the hand and began pulling with terrific
force. She pulled him off balance.</p>
<p>“Hey! Where are we going?”</p>
<p>“Come on! It’s in the kitchen!” Towing him toward the kitchen, she
now leaned so far over that almost the entire weight of her body hung
from his hand, which held hers.</p>
<p>“Hey! Watch it. You’re gonna fall down, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“Come…on!” He lurched behind her, ground between his fears and his
love for a six-year-old who wanted to show him a rabbit.</p>
<p>The doorway led into a short hallway, lined with closets, and then
into the butler’s pantry, lined with glass-front cabinets containing
sparkling battalions of crystal, and stainless-steel sinks. The
cabinets, with their beadings, muntins, mullions, cornices—he couldn’t
remember all the terms—had cost thousands…thousands…The passion Judy had
put into these…things…The way they had spent money…Hemorrhaging
money…</p>
<p>And now they were in the kitchen. More cabinets, cornices, stainless
steel, tiles, spotlights, the Sub-Zero, the Vulcan—all of it the best
Judy’s endless research could find, all of it endlessly expensive,
hemorrhaging and hemorrhaging…Bonita was by the Vulcan stove.</p>
<p>“Hi, Mr. McCoy.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Bonita.”</p>
<p>Lucille, the maid, was sitting on a stool by a counter, drinking a
cup of coffee.</p>
<p>“Mr. McCoy.”</p>
<p>“Why, hello, Lucille.” Hadn’t seen her in ages; hadn’t been home
early enough. He should have something to say to her, since it had been
so long, but he couldn’t think of a thing except for how sad it all was.
They were proceeding with their routines, secure in their belief that
everything was the way it always had been.</p>
<p>“Over here, Daddy,” Campbell kept pulling. She didn’t want him to get
sidetracked talking to Bonita and Lucille.</p>
<p>“Campbell!” said Bonita. “Don’t pull your daddy like that!”</p>
<p>Sherman smiled and felt ineffectual. Campbell ignored her. Then she
stopped pulling.</p>
<p>“Bonita’s gonna bake it for me. So it’ll be hard.”</p>
<p>There was the rabbit. It was on a white Formica-topped table. Sherman
stared. He could scarcely believe it. It was an astonishingly good
rabbit, made of clay. It was primitive in execution, but the head was
cocked to one side and the ears were set at expressive angles and the
legs were spread out in an unconventional pose, as bunnies went, and the
massing and proportion of the haunches was excellent. The animal seemed
startled.</p>
<p>“Sweetheart! You did this?”</p>
<p>Very proud: “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“In school.”</p>
<p>“All by yourself?”</p>
<p>“Yes. For real life.”</p>
<p>“Well, Campbell—this is a beautiful rabbit! I’m very proud of you!
You’re so talented!”</p>
<p>Very timid: “I know.”</p>
<p>All at once he wanted to cry. A startled bunny. To think of what it
meant to be able to wish, in this world, to make a bunny rabbit and then
to do it in all innocence, in all confidence that the world would
receive it with love and tenderness and admiration—to think of what she
assumed at the age of six, namely, that this was the nature of the world
and that her mommy and daddy—her daddy!—made it that way and of course
would never let it be any other way.</p>
<p>“Let’s show it to Mommy,” he said.</p>
<p>“She saw it.”</p>
<p>“I bet she loved it.”</p>
<p>The very timid voice: “I know.”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s both show it to her.”</p>
<p>“Bonita has to bake it. So it’ll be hard.”</p>
<p>“Well, I want to go tell Mommy how much I like it.” With a show of
gusto, he swept Campbell up into his arms and threw her over his
shoulder. She took this as a great game.</p>
<p>“Daddy!”</p>
<p>“Campbell, you’re getting so big! Soon I won’t be able to carry you
like a sack of meal anymore. Low bridge! We’re going through the
door.”</p>
<p>Amid much giggling and wriggling, he carried her across the marble
floor, to the library. Judy looked up sharply.</p>
<p>“Campbell, don’t make Daddy carry you. You’re too big for that.”</p>
<p>With just a touch of defiance: “I didn’t make him.”</p>
<p>“We were just playing,” said Sherman. “Did you see Campbell’s rabbit?
Isn’t it beautiful?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s lovely.” She turned her head back toward the television
set.</p>
<p>“I’m really impressed. I think we’ve got an extremely talented little
girl on our hands.”</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>Sherman lowered Campbell from his shoulder down into his arms, as if
she were a baby, and then sat in the armchair and settled her on his
lap. Campbell moved around to get more comfortable and snuggled up
against him, and he put his arms around her. They looked at the
television screen.</p>
<p>The news was on. An announcer’s voice. A blur of black faces. A
picket sign: ACTION—NOW!</p>
<p>“What are they doing, Daddy?”</p>
<p>“It looks like a demonstration, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>Another sign: WEISS JUSTICE IS WHITE JUSTICE.</p>
<p>Weiss?</p>
<p>“What’s a demonstration?” Campbell sat up in his lap and looked at
him when she asked the question, obscuring his view of the screen. He
tried to look around her.</p>
<p>“What’s a demonstration?”</p>
<p>Distractedly, trying to keep one eye on the screen: “Uh…it’s
a—sometimes when people get angry about something, they make some signs
and they march around with them.”</p>
<p>HIT’N’RUN’N’LIE TO THE PEOPLE!</p>
<p>Hit and run!</p>
<p>“What do they get angry about?”</p>
<p>“Just a minute, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“What do they get angry about, Daddy?”</p>
<p>“Almost anything.” Sherman was now leaning far to the left, in order
to see the screen. He had to hold tight to Campbell’s waist to keep from
spilling her off his lap.</p>
<p>“But what?”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s see.”</p>
<p>Campbell turned her head toward the screen but immediately turned
back. There was only some man talking, some black man, very tall,
dressed in a black jacket and a white shirt and a striped tie, standing
next to a thin black woman in a dark dress. There was a huge cluster of
black faces crowded in behind them. Boys with smirks on their faces kept
popping out from behind them and staring into the camera.</p>
<p>“When a young man like Henry Lamb,” the man was saying, “an honor
student, an outstanding young man, when a young man like Henry Lamb
comes into the hospital with acute cerebral concussion and they treat
him for a broken wrist…see…when his mother gives the Police Department
and the district attorney a description of the car that struck him down,
a description of that car…see…and they do nothing, they drag their
feet—”</p>
<p>“Daddy, let’s go back to the kitchen. Bonita’s gonna bake my
rabbit.”</p>
<p>“In a second—”</p>
<p>“—to our people is, ‘We don’t care. Your young people, your honor
students, your hopes don’t count, don’t matter at all’ …see…That’s the
message. But we care, and we’re not gonna stand still, and we’re not
gonna be silent. If the power structure don’t want to do nothing—”</p>
<p>Campbell slid off Sherman’s lap and grabbed his right wrist with both
hands and began pulling. “Come on, Daddy.”</p>
<p>The face of the thin black woman rilled the screen. Tears rolled down
her cheeks. A fluffy-haired young white man was on the screen with a
microphone at his lips. There was a whole universe of black faces behind
him and more boys mugging for the camera.</p>
<p>“—that as yet unidentified Mercedes-Benz sedan with a license plate
beginning with RE, RF, RB, or RP. And just as Reverend Bacon maintains
that a message is coming through to this community from the authorities,
these protesters have a message for them: ‘If you don’t launch a
full-scale investigation, we’ll do it ourselves.’ This is Robert Corso,
THE LIVE 1, in the Bronx.”</p>
<p>“Daddy!” She was pulling on him so hard the chair began to tip.</p>
<p>“RF?” Judy had turned to look at Sherman. “Ours begins with RF,
doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Now! Tell her!</p>
<p>“Daddy! Come on! I wanna bake the rabbit!”</p>
<p>There was no concern in Judy’s face. She was merely surprised by the
coincidence; so surprised, she had initiated a conversation.</p>
<p>Now!</p>
<p>“Daddy, come on!”</p>
<p>See about baking the rabbit.</p>
