<h4 id="off-to-a-better-place">28. Off to a Better Place</h4>
<p>“Listen, Sherman. Do you think she honestly cares whether you’re a
gentleman or anything else at this point? Do you think she’s gonna
voluntarily jeopardize her interests to help you out? She don’t even
tawk to you, f’r Chrissake.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“I do know. You don’t get the picture yet? She married Ruskin, f’r
Chrissake, and whaddaya think she felt for him? I bet she studied the
actuarial tables. Awright? I bet you she actually studied the fucking
actuarial tables.”</p>
<p>“You may be right. But that doesn’t excuse anything I do. This is a
funeral we’re talking about, her husband’s funeral!”</p>
<p>Killian laughed. “You can call it a funeral if you want. To her it’s
Christmas.”</p>
<p>“But to do this to a widow on the day of her husband’s funeral,
practically on top of the corpse!”</p>
<p>“Awright. Let me put it to you another way. Whaddaya want, a gold
star for ethics…or your own funeral?”</p>
<p>Killian had his elbows on the arms of his desk chair. He leaned
forward and cocked his head, as if to say, “What’s that, Sherman? I
don’t hear you.”</p>
<p>And in that instant, Sherman had a vision of that place and them. If
he had to go to jail, even for a few months—let alone years—</p>
<p>“This is the one time you know you’re gonna see her,” said Killian.
“She’s got to turn up for the guy’s fucking funeral. She’ll face you and
ten like you for the payoff at the end of that one.”</p>
<p>Sherman lowered his eyes and said, “Okay. I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>“Believe me,” said Killian, “it’s perfectly legal, and under the
circumstances it’s perfectly fair. You’re not doing anything to Maria
Ruskin. You’re protecting yourself. You have every right.”</p>
<p>Sherman looked up at Killian and nodded yes, as if he were assenting
to the end of the world.</p>
<p>“We better get started,” said Killian, “before Quigley goes out to
lunch. He does all our wiring.”</p>
<p>“You do that much of it?”</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, this is a standard procedure now. We don’t exactly
advertise it, but we do it all the time. I’m gonna get Quigley.”</p>
<p>Killian got up and went down the corridor. Sherman’s eyes drifted
over the dreadful blind interior of the little office. How inexpressibly
grim! And yet here he was. This was his last redoubt. He was sitting
here, of his own free will, waiting to be wired in order to steal,
through the most indecent sort of deception, testimony from someone he
had loved. He nodded, as if someone else were in the room, and that nod
said, “Yes, but that’s what I’m going to do.”</p>
<p>Killian returned with Quigley. High on Quigley’s waistband, on the
left side, was a .38-caliber revolver, in a holster, with the handle
facing forward. He came in carrying some sort of attaché case. He smiled
at Sherman in an abrupt businesslike fashion.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Quigley said to Sherman, “you’ll have to take off your
shirt.”</p>
<p>Sherman did as he was told. The bodily vanity of the male knows no
bounds. Sherman’s immediate concern was that the definition of his
pectoral, abdominal, and triceps muscles stand out sufficiently for
these two men to be impressed by his physique. For a moment this cut
through everything else. He knew that if he extended his arms straight
down as if he were simply holding them at his sides, the triceps muscles
would flex.</p>
<p>Quigley said, “I’m gonna put the recorder in the small of your back.
You’re gonna wear a jacket over there, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Okay. That’ll be no problem then.”</p>
<p>Quigley got down on one knee, opened his attaché case, took out the
wires and the recorder, which was about the size of a deck of cards. The
microphone was a gray cylinder the size of the eraser and metal band on
the top of an ordinary pencil. First he taped the recorder onto
Sherman’s back. Then he taped the wire around his waist from back to
front and up his abdomen to the hollow between his pectoral muscles,
just above the sternum, where he taped the microphone.</p>
<p>“That’s good,” he said. “It’s down deep. It won’t show at all,
especially if you wear a necktie.”</p>
<p>Sherman took that as a compliment. Down deep…between the massive
hillocks of my manly chest muscles.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Quigley, “you can put your shirt on, and we’ll test
it.”</p>
<p>Sherman put his shirt and tie and jacket back on. Well…he was now
wired. Cold spots of metal in the small of his back and over his
sternum…He had become that loathsome animal…the…the…But loathsome was
only a word, wasn’t it? Now that he had actually become that creature,
he no longer actually felt even a twinge of guilt. Fear had remapped the
moral geography very quickly.</p>
<p>“Awright,” said Killian. “Now we’re gonna go over what you’re gonna
say. You’re only gonna need a couple of statements out of her, but you
gotta know exactly how you’re gonna get ’em. Awright? So let’s get
started.”</p>
<p>He motioned toward the white plastic chair, and Sherman sat down to
learn the manly art of entrapment. “Not entrapment,” he said to himself.
“Truth.”</p>
<p>Harold A. Burns’s, on Madison Avenue, had been the most fashionable
funeral parlor in New York for many years, but Peter Fallow had never
set foot in the place before. The dark green double doors on Madison
were framed by a formal set of pilasters. The vestibule within was no
more than twelve by twelve feet. Yet from the moment he entered, Fallow
was aware of an overpowering sensation. The light in the little space
was intensely bright, so bright he didn’t even want to seek out the
source, for fear it would blind him. A bald-headed man in a dark gray
suit stood in the vestibule. He handed Fallow a program and said,
“Please sign the register.” There was a podium, upon which was a large
date book and a ballpoint pen tethered by a brass chain. Fallow added
his name to the roster.</p>
<p>As his eyes began to adjust to the light, he became aware that there
was a large doorway beyond the vestibule and that someone was staring at
him. Not someone, however, but several people…not several, but…scores of
them! The doorway led to a short flight of stairs. So many eyes bearing
down upon him! The mourners were seated in what looked like the
sanctuary of a small church, and they were all staring at him. The pews
faced a stage, upon which the service would take place and in front of
which rested the coffin of the recently departed. The vestibule was a
second stage, off to one side, and by turning their heads the mourners
could see each person who arrived. And everyone turned his head. But of
course! This was Manhattan. The Upper East Side! The dear deceased, who
reposeth in that box up front? Alas, the poor devil is done for, dead
and gone. But the quick and the living—ah!—there you have something.
They still burn with the lovely social wattage of the city! Not who
leaveth, but who cometh in! Let us by all means illuminate them and
measure their radiance!</p>
<p>They kept coming, Baron Hochswald, Nunnally Voyd, Bobby Shaflett, Red
Pitt, Jackie Balch, the Bavardages, one and all, the whole bold-faced
population of the gossip columns, stepping into the blazing light of the
vestibule with faces so suitably grim that it made Fallow want to laugh.
Solemnly they entered their names in the register. He would want to take
a good look at that list of autographs before he left.</p>
<p>Soon the place was packed. A rustle ran through the crowd. A door to
the side of the stage opened. People began to rise up in their seats to
get a better look. Fallow rose to a crouch.</p>
<p>Well, there she was—or Fallow assumed it was she. At the head of a
procession was…the Mystery Brunette, the Widow Ruskin. She was a trim
woman wearing a long-sleeved black silk suit with huge shoulders and a
black silk blouse and a black fez-style hat, from which issued a
voluminous black veil. That outfit was going to cost the estate a few
Mecca ticket receipts. With her were half a dozen people. Two of them
were Ruskin’s sons by his first marriage, a pair of middle-aged men,
each old enough to be Maria Ruskin’s father. There was a fortyish woman
who Fallow assumed was Ruskin’s daughter by his second wife. There was
an old woman, perhaps Ruskin’s sister, plus two more women and two men
Fallow couldn’t figure out at all. They sat down in the front row, near
the coffin.</p>
<p>Fallow was on the opposite side of the room from the door from which
Maria Ruskin had come and through which she might disappear at the end
of the service. Some rude journalistic aggressiveness might be called
for. He wondered if the Widow Ruskin had hired any sort of bodyguards
for the occasion.</p>
<p>A tall, slender, very dapper figure ascended the four or five steps
to the stage in front and went to the podium. He was fashionably dressed
for mourning, with his navy double-breasted suit, black tie, white
shirt, and narrow-toed black shoes. Fallow looked at his program. This
was apparently a man named B. Monte Griswold, director of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. He fished a pair of half spectacles out of
his breast pocket, spread some sheets of paper out before him, looked
down, looked up, took off the half spectacles, paused, and said, in a
rather fluty voice:</p>
<p>“We are here not to mourn Arthur Ruskin but to celebrate his very
full…and very generous life.”</p>
<p>It made Fallow’s flesh crawl, this American penchant for the personal
and the sentimental. The Yanks couldn’t even let the dead depart with
dignity. Everyone in the hall would be in for it now. He could feel it
coming, the pointless bathos, the dripping spoonfuls of soul. It was
enough to drive an Englishman back into the bosom of the Church of
England, wherein death and all the major junctures of life were dealt
with upon the high ground of the Divine, an invariable and admirably
formal eminence.</p>
<p>Ruskin’s eulogizers were every bit as witless and tasteless as Fallow
had imagined they would be. The first was a United States senator from
New York, Sidney Greenspan, whose accent was exceptionally vulgar, even
by American standards. He stressed Arthur Ruskin’s generosity toward the
United Jewish Appeal, an unfortunate note in view of the just-revealed
fact that his financial empire was founded upon the ferrying of Muslims
to Mecca. The senator was followed by one of Ruskin’s partners, Raymond
Radosz. He started off pleasantly enough with an anecdote about a period
when the two of them were close to bankruptcy, but then trailed off on
an embarrassing tangent about the glories of their holding company,
Rayart Equities, which would keep Artie’s—he called him Artie—Artie’s
spirit alive, so long as loans floated and debentures were convertible.
Then came a jazz pianist, “Arthur’s favorite,” named Manny Leerman, to
play a medley of “Arthur’s favorite songs.” Manny Leerman was a fat
red-haired man who wore a robin’s-egg-blue double-breasted suit, which
he laboriously unbuttoned after sitting down at the piano, so that the
collar of the suit wouldn’t ride up above his shirt collar. Arthur’s
favorite songs turned out to be “September in the Rain,” “The Day Isn’t
Long Enough (When I’m with You),” and “The Flight of the Bumblebee.”
This last the florid little pianist played in a rousing but not flawless
manner. He wound up his performance by spinning around 180 degrees on
the piano stool, before it dawned on him that this was not a club date
and he was not supposed to take a bow. He buttoned up his
double-breasted jacket before he left the stage.</p>
<p>Then came the main speaker, Hubert Birnley, the movie actor, who had
decided that what was needed was the light touch and the human side of
Arthur the great financier and ferry captain to the Arab world. He
became mired in an anecdote that hinged largely upon one’s comprehension
of the problems people have with swimming-pool-filtration systems in
Palm Springs, California. He left the stage dabbing a handkerchief at
the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>Last on the program was Cantor Myron Branoskowitz, of Congregation
Schlomoch’om, Bayside, Queens. He was a huge young man, a
three-hundred-pounder, who began singing in Hebrew in a strong clear
tenor voice. His lamentations began to swell in volume. They were
unending and irrepressible. His voice took on throbs and vibratos. If
there was a choice between ending a phrase in a high octave or a low
one, he invariably went high, like an opera singer in concert, indulging
his virtuosity. He put tears into his voice that would have embarrassed
the worst hambone Pagliacci. At first the mourners were impressed. Then
they were startled as the voice grew in volume. Then they became
concerned as the young man appeared to swell like a frog. And now they
were beginning to look at one another, each wondering if his neighbor
was thinking the same thing: “This kid is out to lunch.” The voice rose,
rose, then peaked with a note just this side of a yodel before plunging
to a lower range with a teary cascade of vibrato and coming to an abrupt
halt.</p>
<p>The service was over. The audience paused, but Fallow did not. He
slipped out into the aisle and, crouching slightly, began hurrying down
toward the front. He was ten or twelve rows from the front when a figure
ahead of him did the same thing.</p>
<p>It was a man wearing a navy-blue suit, a snap-brim hat, and dark
glasses. Fallow caught only the briefest glimpse of the side of his
head…the chin…It was Sherman McCoy. He had no doubt worn the hat and the
glasses in order to enter the funeral home without being recognized. He
rounded the bend at the first pew and fell in behind the family’s little
entourage. Fallow did the same. Now he could get a glimpse of the
profile. It was McCoy all right.</p>
<p>The crowd was already in the hubbub of departing a funeral service
and letting off the steam of thirty or forty minutes of obligatory
respectfulness toward a rich man who, while alive, had not been
particularly warm or likable. A funeral-parlor functionary was holding
open the little side door for the Widow Ruskin. McCoy stayed close on
the heels of a tall man who was in fact, as Fallow could now see, Monte
Griswold, the master of ceremonies. The eulogizers were joining the
family backstage. McCoy and Fallow were merely part of a mournful troop
of dark blue suits and black dresses. Fallow folded his arms over his
chest to hide the brass buttons on his blazer, for fear they would look
out of place.</p>
<p>There was no problem. The funeral-home doorman was intent only on
herding inside everyone who was going inside. The little door led to a
short flight of stairs, at the top of which was a suite of rooms, like a
little apartment. Everyone gathered in a small reception room decorated
with balloon shades and panels of fabric framed in gilded wood, in the
nineteenth-century French manner. Everyone was paying his condolences to
the widow, who could scarcely be seen behind the wall of blue suits.
McCoy hung about the edges, still wearing his dark glasses. Fallow
stayed behind McCoy.</p>
<p>He could hear the baritone burble of Hubert Birnley talking to the
widow and no doubt saying perfectly proper and fatuous things with a sad
but charming Birnley smile on his face. Now it was Senator Greenspan’s
turn, and his nasal voice could be heard saying no doubt several wrong
things along with the right ones. And then Monte Griswold had his turn,
uttering impeccable things, one could be sure, and waiting to receive
the widow’s compliments for his skills as emcee. Monte Griswold said
good-bye to the Widow Ruskin, and—bango!—McCoy confronted her. Fallow
was right behind him. He could see Maria Ruskin’s features through the
black veil. Young and beautiful! Nothing quite like it! Her dress
accentuated her breasts and brought out the conformation of her lower
abdomen. She was looking straight at McCoy. McCoy leaned so close to her
face Fallow thought at first he was going to kiss her. But he was
whispering. The Widow Ruskin was saying something in a low voice. Fallow
leaned in closer. He crouched right behind McCoy.</p>
<p>He couldn’t make it out…A word here and
there…“straight”…“essential”…“both”…“car”—</p>
<p>Car. As soon as he heard the word, Fallow experienced a feeling that
journalists live for. Before the mind can digest what the ears have just
heard, an alarm puts the nervous system on red alert. A story! It is a
neural event, a feeling as palpable as any recorded by the five senses.
A story!</p>
<p>Damn. McCoy was mumbling again. Fallow leaned in still closer…“other
one”…“ramp”…“skidded”—</p>
<p>Ramp! Skidded!</p>
<p>The widow’s voice rose. “Shuhmun”—she seemed to be calling him
Shuhmun. “Kint we tuk about it letter?”</p>
<p>“Letter?” wondered Fallow. “Something about a letter?” Then he
realized she was saying later.</p>
<p>Now McCoy’s voice rose: “…time, Maria!”…“right there with me—you’re
my only witness!”</p>
<p>“Uh kint make myself think about all that now, Shuhmun.” The same
strained voice, ending with a little throb in the throat. “Kintchuh
understand? Duntchuh know where you uh? My husband’s dead, Shuhmun.”</p>
<p>She cast her eyes down and began shaking with soft sobs. Immediately
a wide squat man was by her side. It was Raymond Radosz, who had spoken
during the service.</p>
<p>More sobs. McCoy walked away quickly, heading out of the room. For an
instant Fallow started to follow him, then wheeled about. The Widow
Ruskin was the story now.</p>
<p>Radosz was now hugging the widow so hard the enormous shoulders of
her mourning outfit were buckling. She looked lopsided. “It’s okay,
honey,” he said. “You’re a brave kid, and I know exactly how you feel,
because me and Artie went through a lot together. We go back a long,
long way, back before you weren’t even born, I guess. And I can tell you
one thing. Artie woulda liked the service. I can tell you that. He
woulda liked it, with the senator and everybody.”</p>
<p>He waited for a compliment.</p>
<p>The Widow Ruskin pulled her grief together. It was the only way to
disengage from her ardent mourner. “But you most especially, Ray,” she
said. “You knew him best, and you knew just how to put it. I know Arthur
rests easier, for what you said.”</p>
<p>“Awwww, well, thank you, Maria. You know, I could kinda see Artie in
front of me while I was talking. I didn’t have to think what I was gonna
say. It just came out.”</p>
<p>Presently he departed, and Fallow stepped forward. The widow smiled
at him, just the least bit disconcerted because she didn’t know who he
was.</p>
<p>“I’m Peter Fallow,” he said. “As you may know, I was with your
husband when he died.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” she said, giving him a quizzical look.</p>
<p>“I just wanted you to know,” said Fallow, “that he didn’t suffer. He
simply lost consciousness. It happened”—Fallow brought his hands up in a
gesture of helplessness—“like that. I wanted you to know that everything
that could have been done was done, or so it seems to me. I attempted
artificial respiration, and the police responded very rapidly. I know
how one can wonder about these things, and I wanted you to know. We had
just had an excellent dinner and an excellent conversation. The last
thing I remember was your husband’s wonderful laugh. In all honesty I
must tell you, there are worse ways—it’s a terrible loss, but it was not
a terrible ending.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said. “You’re awfully kind to tell me this. I’ve
reproached myself for being away from him when…”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t,” said Fallow.</p>
<p>The Widow Ruskin looked up at him and smiled. He was aware of the
sparkle in her eyes and the curious curl of her lips. She was able to
put a coquettish edge even on a widow’s thanks.</p>
<p>Without changing his tone of voice, Fallow said, “I couldn’t help but
notice Mr. McCoy speaking to you.”</p>
<p>The widow was smiling with her lips parted slightly. First the smile
shrank away. Then the lips closed.</p>
<p>“In fact, I couldn’t help but overhear your conversation,” said
Fallow. Then, with a bright and amiable look on his face and a
full-blown English Country Weekend accent, as if he were asking about
the guest list at a dinner party: “I gather you were in the car with
Mr. McCoy when he had his unfortunate accident in the Bronx.”</p>
<p>The widow’s eyes turned into a pair of cinders.</p>
<p>“I was hoping that perhaps you might tell me exactly what happened
that night.”</p>
<p>Maria Ruskin stared at him a moment longer and then said, between
tight lips: “Look, Mr.—Mr.—”</p>
<p>“Fallow.”</p>
<p>“—Peckerhead. This is my husband’s funeral, and I don’t want you
here. You understand? So get out—and disintegrate.”</p>
<p>She turned and walked off toward Radosz and a group of blue suits and
black dresses.</p>
<p>As he left the Harold A. Burns funeral home, Fallow was giddy with
the knowledge of what he had. The story existed not only in his mind but
in his skin and his solar plexus. It surged like a current in every axon
and dendrite of his body. As soon as he got near the word processor, the
story would pour out of his fingers—pre-formed. He wouldn’t have to say,
allege, imply, speculate that the beautiful and now fabulously wealthy
merry young Widow Ruskin was the Mystery Brunette. McCoy had said it for
him. “Right there with me—my only witness!” The Widow Ruskin had
remained tight-lipped—but she hadn’t denied it. Nor had she denied it
when the journalist, the great Fallow, when I—when I—when I—that was it.
He would write it in the first person. Another first-person exclusive,
like DEATH NEW YORK STYLE. I, Fallow—dear God, he hungered, lusted, for
the word processor! The story vibrated in his mind, his heart, his very
groin.</p>
<p>But he made himself stop by the register in the vestibule and copy
down the names of all the celebrated souls who had been on hand to pay
their respects to the lovely widow of Mecca’s Kosher Ferry Captain
without dreaming of the drama unfolding beneath their prurient noses.
They would know soon enough. I, Fallow!</p>
<p>Out on the sidewalk, just beyond the vestibule, were clusters of
these very same luminous personages, most of them having the sort of
exuberant grinning conversations people in New York somehow can’t help
having at events that dramatize their exalted status. Funerals were no
exception. The huge young cantor, Myron Branoskowitz, was talking
with—or talking to—a severe-looking older man whose name Fallow had just
copied from the register: Jonathan Buchman, the chief executive officer
of Columbia Records. The cantor spoke with great animation. His hands
made little flights in the air. Buchman’s expression was rigid,
paralyzed by the sonorous logorrhea that spewed so ceaselessly into his
face.</p>
<p>“No problem!” said the cantor. It was almost a shout. “No problem at
all! I’ve already made the cassettes! I’ve done every one of the Caruso
standards! I can have them over to your office tomorrow! You got a
card?”</p>
<p>The last thing Fallow saw, before he left, was Buchman fishing a card
out of a trim little lizard-skin card wallet, while Cantor Branoskowitz
added, in the same declamatory tenor:</p>
<p>“Mario Lanza, too! I’ve done Mario Lanza! I want you to have them,
too!”</p>
<p>“Well—”</p>
<p>“No problem!”</p>
