<h4 id="the-case">8. The Case</h4>
<p>Martin, the Irish detective, was at the wheel, and his partner,
Goldberg, the Jewish detective, was in the passenger seat, and Kramer
was in the back seat, sitting at just the right angle, it so happened,
to see the speedometer. They were driving down the Major Deegan
Expressway at a good Irish sixty-five miles an hour, heading for
Harlem.</p>
<p>Martin’s being Irish was very much on Kramer’s mind at this moment.
He had just figured out where he had first seen the man. It was soon
after he joined the Homicide Bureau. He had been sent out to East 152nd
Street, where a man had been shot to death in the back of an automobile.
The automobile was a Cadillac Sedan DeVille. One of the rear doors was
open, and there was a detective standing by it, a little fellow, no more
than 150 pounds, with a thin neck, a skinny, slightly lopsided face, and
the eyes of a Doberman pinscher. Detective Martin. Detective Martin
gestured toward the open door with a sweep of his hand, like a
headwaiter. Kramer looked in, and what he saw was horrible beyond
anything the phrase “shot to death in the back of an automobile” had
even begun to suggest to him. The victim was a fat man in a loud,
checked jacket. He was sitting on the back seat with his hands on his
legs, just above his knees, as if he were about to hitch up his pants to
keep them from being stretched by his kneecaps. He appeared to be
wearing a bright scarlet bib. Two-thirds of his head was gone. The rear
window of the Cadillac looked as if someone had thrown a pizza up
against it. The red bib was arterial blood, which had pumped out of the
stalk of his head like a fountain. Kramer backed out of the car. “Shit!”
he said. “Did you see that? How did they—I mean, shit!—it’s all over the
car!” To which Martin had said, “Yeah, musta ruined his whole fucking
day.” At first Kramer had taken this as a rebuke for his becoming
unglued by the sight, but later he figured Martin wouldn’t have had it
any other way. What was the fun of introducing people to vintage Bronx
mayhem if they didn’t become unglued? After that, Kramer made a point of
being as Irish as they come at the crime scenes.</p>
<p>Martin’s partner, Goldberg, was twice his size, a real side of beef,
with thick curly hair, a mustache that drooped slightly at the corners
of the mouth, and a fat neck. There were Irishmen named Martin and Jews
named Martin. There were Germans named Kramer and Jews named Kramer. But
every Goldberg in the history of the world was a Jew, with the possible
exception of this one. By now, being Martin’s partner, he had probably
turned Irish, too.</p>
<p>Martin, in the driver’s seat, turned his head slightly to talk to
Kramer in the back seat. “I can’t believe I’m actually driving to Harlem
to listen to this asshole. If it was a wiretap, that I could believe.
How the hell did he get to Weiss?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Kramer. He said it wearily, just to show that he
was a good knockabout fellow who realized this mission was a jerk-off.
In fact, he was still sailing on the verdict that had come in last
night. Herbert 92X had gone down. Shelly Thomas had popped up, glorious
as the sun. “Apparently Bacon called Joseph Leonard. You know Leonard?
The black assemblyman?”</p>
<p>Kramer’s radar told him that black was too delicate, too refined, too
trendy-liberal a designation for a conversation with Martin and
Goldberg, but he didn’t want to try out anything else.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know him,” said Martin. “He’s a piece a work, too.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m only guessing,” said Kramer, “but Weiss has an election
coming up in November, and if Leonard wants a favor, Weiss’ll do him a
favor. He thinks he needs black support. This Puerto Rican, Santiago, is
running against him in the primary.”</p>
<p>Goldberg snorted. “I love the word they use, support. Like they think
there’s some organization out there. That’s a fucking laugh. In the
Bronx they couldn’t organize a cup a coffee. Bedford-Stuyvesant, the
same thing. I’ve worked the Bronx, Bedford-Stuyvesant, and Harlem. In
Harlem they’re more sophisticated. In Harlem if you bring some asshole
in and you tell him, ‘Look, there’s two ways we can do this, the easy
way and the hard way, it’s up to you,’ at least they know what you’re
talking about. In the Bronx or Bed-Stuy, fuhgedaboudit. Bed-Stuy’s the
worst. In Bed-Stuy you just might as well start rolling in the dirt from
the git-go. Right, Marty?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Martin, without enthusiasm. Goldberg had used no
designation at all, other than they. Martin didn’t seem to want to get
into a discussion of cop philosophy in the first place. “So Bacon calls
Leonard, and Leonard calls Weiss,” said Martin. “And then what?”</p>
<p>“This kid Lamb, his mother works for Bacon, or she used to work for
Bacon,” said Kramer. “She claims she has some information about what
happened to her son, but she has a whole buncha parking tickets, and
there’s a scofflaw warrant out for her, and she’s afraid to go to the
police. So the deal is, Weiss quashes the warrant and works out a
schedule whereby she can pay off the tickets, and she gives us the
information, but it has to be in Bacon’s presence.”</p>
<p>“And Weiss agrees to this.”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>“Beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Well, you know Weiss,” said Kramer. “All he cares about is, he’s
Jewish and he’s running for reelection in a county that’s 70 percent
black and Puerto Rican.”</p>
<p>Goldberg said, “You ever run into Bacon before?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You better take off your watch before you go in there. Fucking guy
don’t lift a finger except to steal.”</p>
<p>Martin said, “I was thinking about that, Davey. I can’t see where’s
there’s any money in this thing, but you can bet it’s there somewhere.”
Then to Kramer: “You ever hear a the Open Gates Employment
Coalition?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“That’s one a Bacon’s operations. You know how they turn up at
restaurants demanding jobs for minorities? You shoulda been at that
fucking brawl up on Gun Hill Road. There wasn’t a fucking white face
working up there. So I don’t know what kinda minorities they’re talking
about, unless a buncha bongos carrying lengths a pipe, you call that a
minority.”</p>
<p>Kramer wondered whether or not bongos could be interpreted as a
racial epithet. He didn’t want to be that Irish. “Well then, what’s in
it for them?”</p>
<p>“Money,” said Martin. “If the manager said, ‘Oh yeah, we need some
extra hands, you can all have jobs,’ they’d look at him like he had bugs
on his eyeballs. They just take money to stay away. It’s the same way
with the Third World Anti-Defamation League. They’re the ones that go
downtown to Broadway and raise hell. That’s one a Bacon’s operations,
too. He’s a sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“But the Open Gates Employment Coalition,” said Kramer, “they
actually get in fights.”</p>
<p>“Pitched fucking battles,” said Goldberg.</p>
<p>“If it’s a scam, why would they do that? They could get killed.”</p>
<p>“You have to see ’em,” said Martin. “Those crazy fucks’ll go brawling
all day for nothing. So why wouldn’t they do it if somebody pays ’em a
few dollars?”</p>
<p>“Remember that one that swung on you with the pipe, Marty?”</p>
<p>“Remember him? I saw him in my fucking sleep. A big tall asshole with
a gold earring hanging off his head, like this.” Martin made a big O
with his thumb and forefinger and put it under his right ear.</p>
<p>Kramer didn’t know how much of this to believe. He had once read an
article in The Village Voice describing Bacon as a “street socialist,” a
black political activist who had arrived at his own theories about the
shackles of capitalism and the strategies required to give black people
their due. Kramer had no interest in left-wing politics, and neither did
his father. Yet in their house, when he was growing up, the word
socialist had religious overtones. It was like Zealot and Masada. There
was something Jewish about it. No matter how wrongheaded a socialist
might be, no matter how cruel and vindictive, he possessed somewhere in
his soul a spark of the light of God, of Yahweh. Maybe Bacon’s operation
was extortion, and maybe it wasn’t. Looked at one way, the entire
history of the labor movement was extortion. What was a strike but
extortion backed up by real or implied threat of violence? The labor
movement had a religious aura in Kramer’s house, too. The unions were a
Masada uprising against the worst of the goyim. His father was a
would-be capitalist, a servant of capitalists in actual fact, who had
never belonged to a labor union in his life and felt infinitely superior
to those who did. Yet one night Senator Barry Goldwater had been on TV
promoting a right-to-work bill, and his father had started growling and
cursing in a way that would have made Joe Hill and the Wobblies look
like labor mediators. Yes, the labor movement was truly religious, like
Judaism itself. It was one of those things you believed in for all
mankind and didn’t care about for a second in your own life. It was
funny about religion…His father wrapped it around himself like a
cape…This guy Bacon wrapped it around himself…Herbert wrapped it around
himself…Herbert…All at once Kramer saw a way to talk about his
triumph.</p>
<p>“It’s funny about these guys and religion,” he said to the two cops
in the front seat. “I just got off a case, a guy called Herbert 92X.” He
didn’t say, “I just won a case.” He would work that in. “This guy…”</p>
<p>Martin and Goldberg probably didn’t give a damn, either. But at least
they would…comprehend…</p>
<p>He remained an animated raconteur all the way to Harlem.</p>
<p>Not a soul was in Reverend Bacon’s great parlor office when the
secretary led Kramer, Martin, and Goldberg in. Most conspicuously absent
was Reverend Bacon himself. His big swivel chair rose up in suspenseful
emptiness behind the desk.</p>
<p>The secretary showed the three of them to armchairs facing the desk,
and then she left. Kramer looked out the bay window behind the swivel
chair at the gloomy tree trunks in the garden. The trunks were mottled
in patches of swamp yellow and rotting green. Then he looked at the
ceiling coving and the plaster dental moldings and all the other
architectural details that had proclaimed Millionaire eighty years ago.
Martin and Goldberg were doing the same thing. Martin looked at Goldberg
and twisted his lips upward on one side with the look that says, “This
is a shuck.”</p>
<p>A door opened, and a tall black man entered the room, looking like
ten million dollars. He wore a black suit, tailored in a way that
brought out the width of his shoulders and the trimness of his waist.
The jacket had a two-button roll that revealed a gorgeous acre of white
shirtfront. The starched collar was immaculate against the man’s dark
skin. He wore a white necktie with a black crisscross pattern, the sort
of necktie that Anwar Sadat used to wear. Kramer felt rumpled just
looking at him.</p>
<p>For an instant he debated whether or not he should rise from his
chair, knowing what Martin and Goldberg would think of any gesture of
respect. But he couldn’t think of any way out of it. So he stood up.
Martin waited a couple of moments, but then he stood up, too, and
Goldberg followed suit. They looked at each other, and both of them
shrugged their lips this time. Since Kramer was up first, the man walked
toward him and held out his hand and said, “Reginald Bacon.”</p>
<p>Kramer shook hands and said, “Lawrence Kramer, Bronx District
Attorney’s Office. Detective Martin. Detective Goldberg.”</p>
<p>From the way Martin looked at Reverend Bacon’s hand with his Doberman
pinscher eyes, Kramer didn’t know whether he was going to shake it or
chew it. He finally shook it. He shook it for at least a fourth of a
second, as if he had just picked up a chunk of creosote. Goldberg
followed suit.</p>
<p>“Get you gentlemen some coffee?”</p>
<p>“No, thanks,” said Kramer.</p>
<p>Martin gave Reverend Bacon a frozen stare and then shook his head
from side to side twice, ve-ry slow-ly, successfully conveying the
message “Not even if I was dying of thirst.” Goldberg, the Jewish
Shamrock, followed suit.</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon walked around behind the desk to his great chair, and
they all sat down. He leaned back in the chair and looked at Kramer with
an impassive expression for what seemed like a very long time and then
said in a soft, low voice. “The district attorney explained to you
Mrs. Lamb’s situation?”</p>
<p>“My bureau chief did, yes.”</p>
<p>“Your bureau chief?”</p>
<p>“Bernie Fitzgibbon. He’s the chief of the Homicide Bureau.”</p>
<p>“You’re from the Homicide Bureau?”</p>
<p>“When a case is listed likely-to-die, they turn it over to the
Homicide Bureau. Not always, but a lot of the time.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to tell Mrs. Lamb you’re from the Homicide
Bureau.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” said Kramer.</p>
<p>“I’d appreciate that.”</p>
<p>“Where is Mrs. Lamb?”</p>
<p>“She’s here. She’s coming in a minute. But I want to tell you
something before she comes in here. She is very upset. Her son is dying,
and she knows that, and she don’t know that…see…It’s something she knows
and something she don’t want to know. You understand? And all this time,
here she is, she’s in trouble over a lot of parking tickets. She says to
herself, ‘I have got to be with my son, and suppose they arrest me over
a lot of parking tickets’…See?”</p>
<p>“Well, she—she don’t have to worry about that,” said Kramer. In a
room with three people who said She don’t, he couldn’t get a doesn’t out
of his mouth. “The district attorney is quashing the warrant. She’s
still gonna have to pay the tickets, but nobody’s gonna arrest her.”</p>
<p>“I told her that, but it’s gonna help if you tell her.”</p>
<p>“Oh, we’re here to help, but I thought she had something to tell us.”
This was for the benefit of Martin and Goldberg, so they wouldn’t think
he was being a pushover.</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon paused again and stared at Kramer, then resumed,
softly, as before. “That is true. She has something to tell you. But you
ought to know about her and her son, Henry. Henry is…was…was…Lord, this
is a tragedy. Henry is a fine young man…a fine young man, fine as you
wanna meet…see…Goes to church, never been in trouble, about to graduate
from high school, getting ready to go to college…a fine young man. And
he already graduated from something tougher than Harvard University. He
grew up in the projects, and he made it. He survived. He came out of it
a fine young man. Henry Lamb is…was!…the hope!…see…the hope. And now
somebody just come along and”—Whop! He slapped his hand down on the
desktop—“run him down and don’t even stop.”</p>
<p>Because Martin and Goldberg were there, Kramer felt the need to
quench the histrionics.</p>
<p>“That may well be, Reverend Bacon,” he said, “but so far we don’t
have any evidence of a hit-and-run.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon gave him his level gaze and then, for the first time,
smiled. “You’re going to have all the evidence you need. You’re going to
meet Henry Lamb’s mother. I know her very well…see…and you can believe
what she says. She’s a member of my church. She’s a hardworking woman, a
good woman…see…a good woman. She’s got a good job, down at the Municipal
Building, in the Marriage Bureau. Don’t take a nickel of welfare. A good
woman with a good son.” Then he pressed a button on his desk and leaned
forward and said, “Miss Hadley, show Mrs. Lamb in. Oh, one more thing.
Her husband, Henry’s father, was killed six years ago, shot to death,
coming home one night, outside the project. Tried to resist a robber.”
Reverend Bacon looked at each of the three of them, nodding the whole
time.</p>
<p>With this, Martin stood up and stared out the bay window. He stared
so intently Kramer thought he must have spotted a burglary in progress,
at the very least. Reverend Bacon looked at him, puzzled.</p>
<p>“What kind of trees are they?” Martin asked.</p>
<p>“Which ones, Marty?” asked Goldberg, and he stood up, too.</p>
<p>“Right there,” said Martin, pointing.</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon swiveled around in his chair and looked out the window
himself. “Those are sycamore trees,” he said.</p>
<p>“Sycamores,” said Martin, in the contemplative tone of a young
naturalist in an arboriculture program. “Look at those trunks. They must
go up fifty feet.”</p>
<p>“Trying to reach the light,” said Reverend Bacon. “Trying to find the
sun.”</p>
<p>Behind Kramer a pair of huge oak doors opened, and the secretary,
Miss Hadley, ushered in a trim black woman, no more than forty, perhaps
younger. She wore a businesslike blue skirt and jacket and a white
blouse. Her black hair was done in soft waves. She had a thin, almost
delicate face and large eyes and the self-possessed look of a teacher or
someone else used to meeting the public.</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon stood up and walked around the desk to meet her.
Kramer stood up also—and understood Martin’s and the Jewish Shamrock’s
sudden interest in the arboreal species. They didn’t want to get trapped
into having to stand when the woman came into the room. It had been bad
enough having to get up for a hustler like Bacon. Doing it again for
some woman from the projects who was part of his setup was taking this
thing too far. This way they were already on their feet, studying the
sycamore trees, when she came in the room.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen,” said Reverend Bacon, “this is Mrs. Annie Lamb. This is
the gentleman from the District Attorney’s Office in the Bronx,
Mr. Kramer. And, uh—”</p>
<p>“Detective Martin, and Detective Goldberg,” said Kramer. “They’re in
charge of the investigation of your son’s case.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lamb didn’t step forward to shake hands and she didn’t smile.
She nodded ever so slightly. She seemed to be withholding judgment on
the three of them.</p>
<p>Very much the shepherd, Reverend Bacon pulled up an armchair for her.
Instead of returning to his big swivel chair, he sat on the edge of the
desk with an athletic casualness.</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon said to Mrs. Lamb, “I was talking to Mr. Kramer here,
and the parking tickets, they’re taken care of.” He looked at
Kramer.</p>
<p>“Well, the warrant’s been quashed,” said Kramer. “There’s no more
warrant. Now there’s just the tickets, and as far as we’re concerned,
we’re not interested in the tickets, anyway.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon looked at Mrs. Lamb and smiled and nodded his head a
few times, as if to say, “Reverend Bacon delivers.” She just looked at
him and pursed her lips.</p>
<p>“Well, Mrs. Lamb,” said Kramer, “Reverend Bacon tells us you have
some information for us about what happened to your son.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lamb looked at Reverend Bacon. He nodded yes and said, “Go
ahead. Tell Mr. Kramer what you told me.”</p>
<p>She said, “My son was hit by a car, and the car didn’t stop. It was a
hit-and-run. But he got the license number, or he got part of it.”</p>
<p>Her voice was businesslike.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute, Mrs. Lamb,” said Kramer. “If you don’t mind, start at
the beginning. When did you first learn about this? When did you first
know your son had been injured?”</p>
<p>“When he came home from the hospital with his wrist in this—uh—I
don’t know what you call it.”</p>
<p>“A cast?”</p>
<p>“No, it wasn’t a cast. It was more like a splint, only it looked like
a big canvas glove.”</p>
<p>“Well, anyway, he came home from the hospital with this wrist injury.
When was that?”</p>
<p>“That was…three nights ago.”</p>
<p>“What did he say had happened?”</p>
<p>“He didn’t say much. He was in a lot of pain, and he wanted to go to
bed. He said something about a car, but I thought he was riding in a car
and they had an accident. Like I say, he didn’t want to talk. I think
they gave him something at the hospital, for the pain. He just wanted to
go to bed. So I told him to go to bed.”</p>
<p>“Did he say who he was with when it happened?”</p>
<p>“No. He wasn’t with anybody. He was by himself.”</p>
<p>“Then he wasn’t in a car.”</p>
<p>“No, he was walking.”</p>
<p>“All right, go ahead. What happened next?”</p>
<p>“The next morning he felt real bad. He tried to lift his head, and he
nearly passed out. He felt so bad I didn’t go to work. I called in—I
stayed home. That was when he told me a car hit him.”</p>
<p>“How did he say it happened?”</p>
<p>“He was walking across Bruckner Boulevard, and this car hit him, and
he fell on his wrist, and he must have hit his head, too, because he has
a terrible concussion.” At this point her composure broke. She closed
her eyes, and they were full of tears when she opened them.</p>
<p>Kramer waited a moment. “Where on Bruckner Boulevard was this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. When he tried to talk, it was too painful for him.
He’d open his eyes and shut his eyes. He couldn’t even sit up.”</p>
<p>“But he was by himself, you said. What was he doing on Bruckner
Boulevard?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. There’s a takeout place up there, at 161st Street, the
Texas Fried Chicken, and Henry, he likes these things they have there,
the chicken nuggets, and so maybe he was going there, but I don’t
know.”</p>
<p>“Where did the car hit him? Where on his body?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that, either. The hospital, maybe they can tell you
that.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon broke in: “The hospital, they fell down on the job.
They didn’t X-ray that young man’s head. They didn’t give him the CAT
scan or the nuclear magnetic resonance or any of those other things.
That young man comes in with a very serious injury to his head, and they
treat his wrist and send him home.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Kramer, “apparently they didn’t know he’d been hit by a
car.” He turned to Martin. “ ’S’at right?”</p>
<p>“The emergency-room report don’t mention an automobile,” said
Martin.</p>
<p>“The boy had a serious injury to his head!” said Reverend Bacon. “He
probably didn’t know half of what he was saying. They’re supposed to
figure out those things.”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s don’t get sidetracked on that,” said Kramer.</p>
<p>“He got part of the license plate,” said Mrs. Lamb.</p>
<p>“What’d he tell you?”</p>
<p>“He said it started with R. That was the first letter. The second
letter was E or F or P or B or some letter like that. That was what it
looked like.”</p>
<p>“What state? New York?”</p>
<p>“What state? I don’t know. I guess New York. He didn’t say it was
something else. And he told me the make.”</p>
<p>“What was it?”</p>
<p>“A Mercedes.”</p>
<p>“I see. What color?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. He didn’t say.”</p>
<p>“Four-door? Two-door?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Did he say what the driver looked like?”</p>
<p>“He said there was a man and a woman in the car.”</p>
<p>“A man was driving?”</p>
<p>“I guess so. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Any description of the man or the woman?”</p>
<p>“They were white.”</p>
<p>“He said they were white? Anything else?”</p>
<p>“No, he just said they were white.”</p>
<p>“That’s all? He didn’t say anything else about them or about the
car?”</p>
<p>“No. He could hardly talk.”</p>
<p>“How did he get to the hospital?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. He didn’t tell me.”</p>
<p>Kramer asked Martin, “Did they say at the hospital?”</p>
<p>“He was a walk-in.”</p>
<p>“He couldn’ta walked from Bruckner Boulevard to Lincoln Hospital with
a broken wrist.”</p>
<p>“Walk-in don’t mean he walked all the way there. It just means he
walked in the emergency room. He wasn’t carried in. The EMS didn’t bring
him. He didn’t come in an ambulance.”</p>
<p>Kramer’s mind was already jumping ahead to trial preparation. All he
could see were dead ends. He paused and then shook his head and said, to
no one in particular: “That don’t give us very much.”</p>
<p>“Whaddaya mean?” said Bacon. For the first time there was a sharp
tone in his voice. “You got the first letter on the license plate, and
you got a line on the second letter, and you got the make of the car—how
many Mercedeses with a license plate beginning with RE, RF, RB, or RP
you think you gonna find?”</p>
<p>“There’s no telling,” said Kramer. “Detective Martin and Detective
Goldberg will run that down. But what we need is a witness. Without a
witness there’s no case here yet.”</p>
<p>“No case?” said Reverend Bacon. “You got a case and a half seems to
me. You got a young man, an outstanding young man, at death’s door. You
got a car and a license plate. How much case you need?”</p>
<p>“Look,” said Kramer, hoping that an ultra-patient, slightly
condescending tone would take care of the implied rebuke. “Let me
explain something to you. Let’s assume we identify the car tomorrow.
Okay? Let’s assume the car is registered in the state of New York, and
there’s only one Mercedes with a license number that begins with R. Now
we’ve got a car. But we got no driver.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but you can—”</p>
<p>“Just because somebody owns a car doesn’t mean”—as soon as it slipped
out, Kramer hoped the doesn’t would blow by undetected—“he was driving
it at a particular time.”</p>
<p>“But you can question that man.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, and we would. But unless he says, ‘Sure, I was involved
in such-and-such a hit-and-run accident,’ we’re back where we
started.”</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon shook his head. “I don’t see that.”</p>
<p>“The problem is, we don’t have a witness. We not only don’t have
anybody to tell us where this thing happened, we don’t even have anybody
who can tell us he was hit by any car at all.”</p>
<p>“You got Henry Lamb himself!”</p>
<p>Kramer raised his hands from his lap and shrugged gently, so as not
to overemphasize the fact that Mrs. Lamb’s son would probably never be
able to bear witness to anything again.</p>
<p>“You got what he told his mother. He told her himself.”</p>
<p>“It gives us a lead, but it’s hearsay.”</p>
<p>“It’s what he told his mother.”</p>
<p>“You may accept it as the truth, and I may accept it as the truth,
but it’s not admissible in a court of law.”</p>
<p>“That don’t make sense to me.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s the law. But in all candor I ought to bring out
something else. Apparently when he came into the emergency room three
nights ago, he didn’t say anything about being hit by a car. That don’t
help matters any.” Don’t. He got it right that time.</p>
<p>“He had a concussion…and a broken wrist…Probably a lot of things he
didn’t say.”</p>
<p>“Well, was he thinking any more clearly the next morning? You could
make that argument, too.”</p>
<p>“Who’s making that argument?” said Reverend Bacon. “You’re making
that argument?”</p>
<p>“I’m not making any argument. I’m just trying to show you that
without a witness there’s a lot of problems.”</p>
<p>“Well, you can find the car, can’t you? You can interrogate the
owner. You can check that car for evidence, can’t you?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” said Kramer. “As I told you, they’re gonna run that down.” He
nodded toward Martin and Goldberg. “They’ll try to find witnesses, too.
But I don’t think a car would yield much evidence. If a car hit him, it
must’ve grazed him. He has some bruises, but he don’t have the kind of
bodily injuries you’d have from being really hit by a car.”</p>
<p>“Say if a car hit him?”</p>
<p>“This case is fulla ifs, Reverend Bacon. If we find a car and an
owner, and if the owner says, ‘Yeah, I hit this young man the other
night, and I didn’t stop, and I didn’t report it,’ then we got a case.
Otherwise, we got a lot of problems.”</p>
<p>“Unh-hunh,” said Reverend Bacon. “So it might be you can’t spend a
whole lot a time on this case, being as it has so many problems?”</p>
<p>“That’s not true. This case will get as much attention as any other
case.”</p>
<p>“You say be candid. Well, I’m going to be candid. Henry Lamb is not a
prominent citizen, and he’s not the son of a prominent citizen, but he’s
a fine young man all the same…see…He’s about to graduate from high
school. He didn’t drop out. He was—he’s thinking about going to college.
Never been in trouble. But he’s from the Edgar Allan Poe projects. The
Edgar Allan Poe projects. He’s a young black man from the projects. Now,
let’s turn this thing around for a minute. Suppose Henry Lamb was a
young white man and he lived on Park Avenue, and he was about to go to
Yale, and he was struck down on Park Avenue by a black man and a black
woman in a…a…Pontiac Firebird instead of a Mercedes…see…And that boy
told his mother what Henry Lamb told his mother. You mean to tell me you
wouldn’t have a case? Instead of talking about problems, you’d be
turning that information inside out and counting the stitches.”</p>
<p>Martin came rumbling to life. “We’d do the same thing we’re doing
right now. We been trying to find Mrs. Lamb here for two days. When did
we find out about a license number? You heard it. I’ve worked Park
Avenue and I’ve worked Bruckner Boulevard. It don’t make any
difference.”</p>
<p>Martin’s voice was so calm and definite, and his stare was so
implacable, so mule-like, so stone Irish, it seemed to jolt Reverend
Bacon for a moment. He tried to outstare the little Irishman, without
success. Then he smiled slightly and said, “You can tell me that,
because I’m a minister, and I want to believe that justice is
blind…see…I want to believe it. But you best not be going out on the
streets of Harlem and the Bronx trying to tell people that. You best not
be informing them about these blessings, because they already know the
truth. They discover it the hard way.”</p>
<p>“I’m on the streets of the Bronx every day,” said Martin, “and I’ll
tell anybody who wants to know.”</p>
<p>“Unh-hunh,” said Reverend Bacon. “We have an organization, All
People’s Solidarity. We survey the communities, and the people come to
us, and I can tell you that the people are not getting your message.
They are getting another message.”</p>
<p>“I been in one a your surveys,” said Martin.</p>
<p>“You been in what?”</p>
<p>“One a your surveys. Up on Gun Hill Road.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>“It was on the streets of the Bronx,” said Martin.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” said Kramer, looking at Mrs. Lamb, “thank you for your
information. And I hope you’ll have some good news about your son. We’ll
check out that license number. In the meantime, if you hear about anyone
who was with your son the other night, or saw anything, you let us know,
okay?”</p>
<p>“Unh-hunh,” she said, striking the same dubious note as she had at
the outset. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Martin was still staring at Reverend Bacon with his Doberman pinscher
eyes. So Kramer turned to Goldberg and said, “You have a card you can
give Mrs. Lamb, with a telephone number?”</p>
<p>Goldberg fished around in an inside pocket and handed her a card. She
took it without looking at it.</p>
<p>Reverend Bacon stood up. “You don’t have to give me your card,” he
said to Goldberg. “I know you…see…I’m going to call you. I’m going to be
on your case. I want to see something done. All People’s Solidarity
wants to see something done. And something will be done…see…So one thing
you can count on: you will hear from me.”</p>
<p>“Anytime,” said Martin. “Anytime you like.”</p>
<p>His lips were parted ever so slightly, with the suggestion of a smile
at the corners. It reminded Kramer of the expression, the Smirking Fang,
that boys wore at the beginning of a playground brawl.</p>
<p>Kramer started walking out, saying his goodbyes over his shoulder as
he went, hoping that would coax Battling Martin and the Jewish Shamrock
out of the room.</p>
<p>On the drive back up to the fortress, Martin said, “Christ, now I
know why they send you guys to law school, Kramer. So you can learn how
to keep a straight face.” He said it good-naturedly, however.</p>
<p>“Well, hell, Marty,” said Kramer, figuring that, having been a fellow
soldier with him in the bullshit skirmish at Reverend Bacon’s, he could
go on a nickname basis with the dauntless little Irish Donkey, “the
kid’s mother was sitting right there. Besides, maybe the license number
will turn up something.”</p>
<p>“You wanna bet on it?”</p>
<p>“It’s a possibility.”</p>
<p>“My ass, it’s a possibility. You get hit by a fucking car, and you go
to the hospital and you don’t happen to mention that to them? And then
you go home and you don’t happen to mention it to your mother? And the
next morning you’re not feeling so hot, so you say, ‘Oh, by the way, I
got hit by a car’? Gedoudahere. That poor bastard took a beating, but it
wasn’t from anything he wanted to tell anybody about.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t doubt that. See if there’s a sheet on him, will
you?”</p>
<p>“You know,” said Goldberg, “I feel sorry for those people. They sit
there saying the kid don’t have a record, like that’s a real fucking
accomplishment. And in the projects, that’s what it is. Just not having
a record! That’s something special. I feel sorry for her.”</p>
<p>And a little of the Jew oozes out of the Jewish Shamrock, thought
Kramer.</p>
<p>But then Martin took up the refrain. “A woman like that, she
shouldn’t even be living in the project, f’r Chrissake. She was all
right. She was straight. Now I remember that case when her husband got
killed. The guy was a working stiff who had heart. Stood up to some
lowlife, and the fucking guy shot him right in the mouth. She works,
don’t take welfare, sends the kid to church, keeps him in school—she’s
all right. No telling what the kid got himself involved in, but she’s
all right. Halfa these people, you know, something happens, and you talk
to them, and they spend so much time blaming the fucking world for what
happened, you can’t halfway find out what the fuck happened in the first
place. But this one, she was straight. Too bad she’s stuck in the
fucking project, but you know”—he looked at Kramer when he said
this—“there’s a lotta decent people in the projects, people that show up
for work.”</p>
<p>Goldberg nodded sagely and said, “You’d never know it now, but that’s
what the fucking places were built for, working people. That was the
whole idea, low-cost housing for working people. And now you find
somebody in’eh who goes to work and tries to do the right thing, it
breaks your fucking heart.”</p>
<p>Then it dawned on Kramer. The cops weren’t all that much different
from the assistant D.A.s. It was the muck factor. The cops got tired of
packing blacks and Latins off to jail all day, too. It was even worse
for them, because they had to dive deeper into the muck to do it. The
only thing that made it constructive was the idea that they were doing
it for somebody—for the decent people. So they opened their eyes, and
now they were attuned to all the good people with colored skin…who rose
to the top…during all this relentless stirring of the muck…</p>
<p>You couldn’t exactly call it enlightenment, thought Kramer, but it
was a fucking start.</p>
