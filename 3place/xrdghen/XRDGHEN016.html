<h4 id="tawkin-irish">16. Tawkin Irish</h4>
<p>Martin’s Irish Machismo was so Icy Kramer couldn’t conceive of him as
high-spirited, except possibly while drunk. Even then, he figured, he
would be a mean and irritable drunk. But this morning he was in high
spirits. His sinister Doberman eyes had become big and bright. He was
happy as a child.</p>
<p>“So we’re standing there in this lobby with these two doormen,” he
was saying, “and there’s a buzz, and this button lights up, and Jesus
Christ, one a these guys, he’s running out the door like he’s got a wire
up his ass, and he’s blowing a whistle and waving his arms for a
cab.”</p>
<p>He looked straight at Bernie Fitzgibbon as he told this tale. The
four of them, Martin, Fitzgibbon, Goldberg, and himself, were in
Fitzgibbon’s office. Fitzgibbon, as befitted a Homicide Bureau chief in
the District Attorney’s Office, was a slender athletic Irishman of the
Black Irish stripe with a square jaw, thick black hair, dark eyes, and
what Kramer called a Locker Room Grin. A Locker Room Grin was quick but
never ingratiating. Fitzgibbon no doubt smiled readily at Martin’s story
and its boorish details because Martin was a particular type of tough
little Harp, and Fitzgibbon understood and valued the breed.</p>
<p>There were two Irishmen in the room, Martin and Fitzgibbon, and two
Jews, Goldberg and himself, but to all intents and purposes there were
four Irishmen. I’m still Jewish, thought Kramer, but not in this room.
All the cops turned Irish, the Jewish cops, like Goldberg, but also the
Italian cops, the Latin cops, and the black cops. The black cops even;
nobody understood the police commissioners, who were usually black,
because their skin hid the fact that they had turned Irish. The same was
true of assistant district attorneys in the Homicide Bureau. You were
supposed to turn Irish. The Irish were disappearing from New York, so
far as the general population was concerned. In politics, the Irish, who
twenty years ago still ran the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and much of
Manhattan, were down to one seedy little district over on the West Side
of Manhattan, over where all the unused piers rusted in the Hudson
River. Every Irish policeman Kramer met, including Martin, lived out on
Long Island or some place like Dobbs Ferry and commuted to the city.
Bernie Fitzgibbon and Jimmy Caughey were dinosaurs. Everybody moving up
in the Bronx District Attorney’s Office was Jewish or Italian. And yet
the Irish stamp was on the Police Department and on the Homicide Bureau
of the D.A.’s Office, and it would probably be there forever. Irish
machismo—that was the dour madness that gripped them all. They called
themselves Harps and Donkeys, the Irish did. Donkeys! They used the word
themselves, in pride but also as an admission. They understood the word.
Irish bravery was not the bravery of the lion but the bravery of the
donkey. As a cop, or as an assistant district attorney in Homicide, no
matter what kind of stupid fix you got yourself into, you never backed
off. You held your ground. That was what was scary about even the
smallest and most insignificant of the breed. Once they took a position,
they were ready to fight. To deal with them you had to be willing to
fight also, and not that many people on this poor globe were willing to
fight. The other side of it was loyalty. When one of them got in a jam,
the others never broke ranks. Well, that wasn’t completely true, but the
game had to be pretty far gone before the Irish started looking out for
Number One. The cops were like that, and assistant D.A.s in Homicide
were supposed to be like that. Loyalty was loyalty, and Irish loyalty
was a monolith, indivisible. The code of the Donkey! And every Jew,
every Italian, every black, every Puerto Rican, internalized that code
and became a stone Donkey himself. The Irish liked to entertain one
another with Irish war stories, so that when Donkey Fitzgibbon and
Donkey Goldberg listened to Donkey Martin, all they lacked was booze so
they could complete the picture by getting drunk and sentimental or
drunk and in a brutal rage. No, thought Kramer, they don’t need alcohol.
They’re high on what tough, undeluded motherfuckers they are.</p>
<p>“I asked one a the doormen about it,” said Martin. “I mean, we had
lotsa time. This fucking McCoy makes us wait down in the lobby for
fifteen minutes. Anyway, on every floor, beside the elevator, they got
two buttons. One is for the elevator, and the other is for cabs. You
push the button, and this little shitball runs out in the street blowing
his whistle and waving his arms. So anyway, we finally get in the
elevator, and it dawns on me I don’t know what floor the fucking guy
lives on. So I stick my head out the door, and I says to the doorman,
‘What button do I push?’ And he says, ‘We’ll send you up there.’ We’ll
send you up there. You can push all the buttons you want inside the
elevator and it don’t mean shit. One a the doormen has to push the
button on his panel out by the door. Even if you live in the fucking
place and you want to go visit somebody else, you can’t just get on the
elevator and push somebody else’s floor. Not that the place strikes me
as the kinda place where they just drop by to shoot the shit. Anyway,
this guy McCoy’s on the tenth floor. The door opens, and you step out
into this little room. It don’t open up on a hall, it opens up on this
little room, and there’s only one door. On that floor the elevator is
just for his fucking apartment.”</p>
<p>“You’ve lived a sheltered life, Marty,” said Bernie Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>“Not fucking sheltered enough, if you ask me,” said Martin. “We ring
the bell, and a maid in a uniform opens the door. She’s Puerto Rican or
South American or something. This hall you walk into, there’s all this
marble and wood paneling and one a those big staircases that goes up
like this, like something in a fucking movie. So we cool our heels on
the marble floor for a while, until the guy figures he’s made us wait
the proper length a time, and then he comes down the stairs, very
slowly, with his fucking chin—I swear to Christ—with his fucking chin up
in the air. You catch that, Davey?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Goldberg. He snorted with amusement.</p>
<p>“What’s he look like?” asked Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>“He’s tall, got the gray suit, got this chin up in the air—your Wall
Street asshole. Not a bad-looking guy. About forty.”</p>
<p>“How did he react to you guys being there?”</p>
<p>“He was pretty cool about the whole thing at first,” said Martin. “He
invited us into this library, I guess it was. It wasn’t very big, but
you shoulda seen this fucking shit up around the ceiling.” He waved his
hand in a sweeping motion. “There’s all these fucking people, carved
outta wood, like crowds a people on the sidewalk, and these shops and
shit in the background. You never seen anything like it. So we’re
sitting there, and I’m telling him how this is a routine check of cars
of this make with this license plate and so on, and he’s saying yeah, he
heard something about the case on television and yeah, he has a Mercedes
with a license number that begins with R, and it sure is a fucking
coincidence, all right—and I mean, I figure, well, this is just another
jerk-off name on this fucking jerk-off list they handed us. I mean, if
you wanna figure out the least likely character you can think of who
would be driving up fucking Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx at night,
this is the guy. I mean, I’m practically apologizing to the guy for
wasting his fucking time. And then I ask him if we can take a look at
it, and he says, ‘When?’ And I says, ‘Now,’ and that was all it took. I
mean, if he said, ‘It’s in the shop’ or ‘My wife’s got it’ or any
goddamned thing, I don’t know if I’da even come back to check it out, it
all looked so fucking unlikely. But he gets this look on his face, and
his lips start trembling, and he starts talking this double-talk about
how he don’t know…and what’s the routine…but it’s mainly the look on his
face. I looked at Davey, and he looked at me, and we both saw the same
goddamned thing. Ain’t that the truth, Davey?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Suddenly the bitch comes out in him. You could see it coming
out.”</p>
<p>“I seen people like this before,” said Martin. “He don’t like this
shit at all. He’s not a bad guy. Looks a little stuck-up, but he’s
probably a nice enough guy. He’s got a wife and a kid. He’s got this
fucking apartment. He ain’t got the heart for this shit. He ain’t got
the heart for being on the wrong side a the law. I don’t care who you
are, sometime in your life you’re gonna be on the wrong side a the law,
and some people got the heart for it and some don’t.”</p>
<p>“He don’t have the heart for you sitting on his fucking desk,” said
Goldberg, laughing.</p>
<p>“His desk?” said Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” said Martin, chuckling at the recollection. “Well, the
thing is, I see the guy starting to come apart, and I say to myself,
‘Well, shit, I ain’t read him his fucking rights yet, so I better do
that.’ So I’m trying to be real casual about it, and I’m telling him how
much we appreciate his cooperation and all, but he don’t have to say
anything if he don’t want to, and he’s entitled to a lawyer, and so
forth, and now I’m thinking ahead. How’m I gonna say, ‘If you can’t
afford an attorney, the state will provide you with one free a charge,’
and make that sound casual, when the fucking carvings on the wall cost
more than a fucking 18b lawyer makes in a year. So I figure I’ll throw
in the old ‘move over’ maneuver for good measure, and I stand right over
him—he’s sitting down at this big desk—and I look at him like, ‘You’re
not gonna do a chickenshit thing like keeping your mouth shut, just
because I’m reading you your rights, are you?’”</p>
<p>“It was worse than that,” said Goldberg. “Marty starts sitting on the
edge of the guy’s fucking desk!”</p>
<p>“What did he do?” asked Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>“Nothing at first,” said Martin. “He knows something’s up. There
ain’t no way you can just say, ‘By the way,’ and read somebody his
rights like you’re just passing the time. But he’s confused. I can see
his eyes getting bigger and bigger. He’s double-talking like a
sonofabitch. Then he gets up, and he says he wants to talk to a lawyer.
The funny thing is, here he starts coming apart when we ask him about
the car, and then we go by and see the car, and it’s clean. There’s not
a mark on it.”</p>
<p>“How did you find his car?”</p>
<p>“That was simple. He told us he kept it in a garage. So I figured, if
you got as much money as this sonofabitch has, you’re gonna keep your
car in the nearest garage. So I asked the doorman where’s the nearest
parking garage. That’s all. Didn’t even mention McCoy.”</p>
<p>“And the garage, they just showed you the car?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I just flashed the badge, and Davey stood on the other side of
him and stared holes in his head. You know, a mean Jew looks a lot
meaner than a mean Harp.”</p>
<p>Goldberg beamed. He took this as a great compliment.</p>
<p>“The guy says, ‘Which car?’” said Goldberg. “Turns out they keep two
cars in the garage, the Mercedes and a Mercury station wagon, and it
costs 10 a month to keep a car in there. It’s posted on the wall. Eight
hundred and twenty dollars a month for two cars. That’s two hundred
dollars more than I pay for my whole fucking house in Dix Hills.”</p>
<p>“So the guy shows you the car?” asked Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>“He tells us where it is and says, ‘Help yourself,’” said Goldberg.
“I get the idea he’s not too crazy about McCoy.”</p>
<p>“Well, he don’t go outta his way to look out for him,” said Martin.
“I asked him if the car was used Tuesday a week ago, in the evening, and
he says, Oh sure, he remembers it very well. McCoy takes it out about
six and comes back about ten, looking like a mess.”</p>
<p>“Nice to have people looking out for your interests,” said
Goldberg.</p>
<p>“Alone?” asked Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>“That’s what he said,” said Martin.</p>
<p>“So you feel sure this is the guy.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Fitzgibbon, “then how do we get a case?”</p>
<p>“We got the start a one now,” said Martin. “We know he was driving
his car that night.”</p>
<p>“Give us twenty more minutes with the fucker and we’ll get the rest,”
said Goldberg. “He’s got the bitch coming out a him already.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t count on that,” said Fitzgibbon, “although you can try.
You know, we really ain’t got shit. We got no witnesses. The kid himself
is out of it. We don’t even know where it happened. Not only that, the
kid comes into the hospital the night it happens, and he don’t say
anything about getting hit by a car.”</p>
<p>A light began to dawn. Kramer broke in: “Maybe he was already gaga.”
A radiance emanated from this erstwhile piece a shit. “We know he took a
pretty good shot to the head.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” said Fitzgibbon, “but that don’t give me anything to move
with, and I’m telling you, Abe is gonna wanna move. He was not happy
about that demonstration yesterday. WEISS JUSTICE IS WHITE JUSTICE. That
was all over the newspapers, and it was on TV.”</p>
<p>“And it was bullshit,” said Goldberg. “We were there. A couple dozen
pickets, half a them the usual nutballs, this Reva Whatsis and her
elves, and the rest a them were rubberneckers.”</p>
<p>“Try telling that to Abe. He saw it on TV, like everybody else.”</p>
<p>“Well, you know,” said Kramer, “this guy McCoy sounds like somebody
we can smoke out maybe.”</p>
<p>“Smoke out?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m just thinking out loud now—but maybe by going public with
it…”</p>
<p>“Going public?” said Fitzgibbon. “Are you kidding? With what? The guy
gets squirrelly when two cops come to his apartment to question him, and
he was driving his car on the night the kid was hit? You know what that
adds up to? Nothing.”</p>
<p>“I said I’m just thinking out loud.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, do me a favor. Don’t think out loud that way in front of
Abe. He’s just liable to take you seriously.”</p>
<p>Reade Street was one of those old streets down near the courthouses
and City Hall. It was a narrow street, and the buildings on either side,
office buildings and light-industry lofts with cast-iron columns and
architraves, kept it in a dismal gloaming, even on a bright spring day
like this. Gradually the buildings in this area, which was known as
TriBeCa, for “triangle below Canal Street,” were being renovated as
offices and apartments, but the area retained an irreducible grime. On
the fourth floor of an old cast-iron building, Sherman walked down a
corridor with a dingy tile floor.</p>
<p>Halfway down the corridor was a plastic plate incised with the names
DERSHKIN, BELLAVITA, FISHBEIN andandandand SCHLOSSEL. Sherman opened the
door and found himself in a tiny and overpoweringly bright glassed-in
vestibule tended by a Latin woman who sat behind a glass partition. He
gave his name and asked to see Mr. Killian, and the woman pressed a
buzzer. A glass door led to a larger, even brighter space with white
walls. The lights overhead were so strong Sherman kept his head down. An
orange industrial cord carpet covered the floor. Sherman squinted,
trying to avoid the ferocious wattage. Just ahead, on the floor, he
could make out the base of a couch. The base was made of white Formica.
Pale tan leather cushions were on top of it. Sherman sat down, and his
tailbone immediately slid forward. The seat seemed to tilt the wrong
way. His shoulder blades hit the back cushions, which rested against a
slab of Formica set perpendicular to the base. Gingerly he lifted his
head. There was another couch across from him. On it were two men and a
woman. One man had on a blue-and-white running suit with two big panels
of electric-blue leather in front. The other man wore a trench coat made
of some dull, dusty, grainy hide, elephant perhaps, with shoulders cut
so wide he seemed gigantic. The woman wore a black leather jacket, also
cut very large, black leather pants, and black boots that folded down
below the knee like a pirate’s. All three of them were squinting, just
as Sherman was. They also kept sliding forward and then twitching and
squirming back up, and their leather clothes rustled and squeaked. The
Leather People. Jammed together on the couch, they resembled an elephant
tormented by flies.</p>
<p>A man entered the reception area from an inner hallway, a tall thin
bald man with bristling eyebrows. He wore a shirt and a tie but no
jacket, and he had a revolver in a holster high on his left hip. He gave
Sherman the sort of dead smile a doctor might give in a waiting room if
he didn’t want to be detained. Then he went back inside.</p>
<p>Voices from the inner hallway: a man and a woman. The man appeared to
be pushing the woman forward. The woman took little steps and looked
back at him over her shoulder. The man was tall and slender, probably in
his late thirties. He wore a double-breasted navy-blue suit with a pale
blue overplaid and a striped shirt with a stiff white collar. The collar
had an exaggerated spread, very much a sharpie’s look, to Sherman’s way
of thinking. He had a lean face, a delicate face, you might have said,
had it not been for his nose, which appeared to have been broken. The
woman was young, no more than twenty-five, all breasts, bright red lips,
raging hair, and sultry makeup, popping out of a black turtleneck
sweater. She wore black pants and teetered atop a pair of black
spike-heel shoes.</p>
<p>At first their voices were muffled. Then the woman’s voice became
louder and the man’s became lower. It was the classic case. The man
wants to confine matters to a quiet private argument, but the woman
decides to play one of her trump cards, which is Making a Scene. There
is Making a Scene, and there is Tears. This was Making a Scene. The
woman’s voice became louder and louder, and at last the man’s rose,
too.</p>
<p>“But you gotta,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“But I don’t gotta, Irene.”</p>
<p>“What am I suppose a do? Rot?”</p>
<p>“You suppose a pay your bills like everybody else,” he said,
mimicking her. “You already beat me for half my fee. And then you keep
asking me to do things that could get me disbarred.”</p>
<p>“You dun care.”</p>
<p>“It ain’t that I dun care, Irene. It’s that I dun care anymore. You
don’t pay your bills. Don’t look at me like that. You’re on your
own.”</p>
<p>“But you gotta! What happens if they rearrest me?”</p>
<p>“You shoulda thoughta that, Irene. What did I tell you the first time
you walked into this office? I told you two things. I told you, ‘Irene,
I’m not gonna be your friend. I’m gonna be your lawyer. But I’m gonna do
more for you than your friends.’ And I said, ‘Irene, you know why I do
this? I do it for money.’ And then I said, ‘Irene, remember those two
things.’ Idd’n’at right? Did’n I say that?”</p>
<p>“I can’t go back there,” she said. She lowered her heavy Tropical
Twilight eyelids and then her whole head. Her lower lip trembled; her
head and the raging hair shook, so did her shoulders.</p>
<p>The Tears.</p>
<p>“Oh, for Christ’s sake, Irene. Come on!”</p>
<p>The Tears.</p>
<p>“All right. Look…I’ll find out if they’re going after you on a
220–31, and I’ll represent you on rearraignment if they are, but that’s
it.”</p>
<p>The Tears!—victorious even after these many millennia. The woman
nodded like a penitent child. She walked out through the blazing waiting
room. Her bottom bobbed in a glossy black shimmer. One of the Leather
Men looked at Sherman and smiled, man to man, and said, “Ay,
caramba.”</p>
<p>On this alien terrain Sherman felt obliged to smile back.</p>
<p>The sharpie came into the reception room and said, “Mr. McCoy? I’m
Tom Killian.”</p>
<p>Sherman stood up and shook hands. Killian didn’t shake hands very
firmly; Sherman thought of the two detectives. He followed Killian down
a hallway with more spotlights.</p>
<p>Killian’s office was small, modern, and grim. It had no window. But
at least it wasn’t bright. Sherman looked at the ceiling. Of the nine
recessed spotlights, seven had been unscrewed or allowed to burn
out.</p>
<p>Sherman said, “The lights out there…” He shook his head and didn’t
bother to finish the sentence.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know,” said Killian. “That’s what you get when you fuck your
decorator. The guy who leased this place, he brought in this number, and
she thought the building was gloomy. She put in, I mean, lights. The
woman had watt fever. The place is supposed to remind you of Key
Biscayne. That’s what she said.”</p>
<p>Sherman didn’t hear anything after “fuck your decorator.” As a Master
of the Universe, he took a masculine pride in the notion that he could
handle all sides of life. But now, like many respectable American males
before him, he was discovering that All Sides of Life were colorful
mainly when you were in the audience. Fuck your decorator. How could he
let any decision affecting his life be made by this sort of person in
this sort of atmosphere? He had called in sick—that lamest, weakest,
most sniveling of life’s small lies—to Pierce andandandand Pierce; for
this itching slum of the legal world.</p>
<p>Killian motioned toward a chair, a modern chair with a curved chrome
frame and Chinese-red upholstery, and Sherman sat down. The back was too
low. There was no way to get comfortable. Killian’s chair, behind the
desk, didn’t look much better.</p>
<p>Killian let out a sigh and rolled his eyes again. “You heard me
conferring with my client, Miss—” He made a curve in the air with his
cupped hand.</p>
<p>“I did. Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well, there you had criminal law in its basic form with all the
elements.” Well, theh you ed crim’nal lawr in its basic fawuhm wit’allee
elements. At first Sherman thought the man was talking this way as
further mimicry of the woman who had just left. Then he realized it
wasn’t her accent. It was Killian’s own. The starched dandy who sat
before him had a New York street accent, full of dropped consonants and
tortured vowels. Nevertheless, he had lifted Sherman’s spirits a notch
or two by indicating that he knew Sherman was new to the world of
criminal law and that he existed on a plateau far above it.</p>
<p>“What sort of case?” asked Sherman.</p>
<p>“Drugs. Who else can afford a trial lawyer for eight weeks?” Then,
without any transition, he said: “Freddy told me your problem. I also
been reading about the case in the tabloids. Freddy’s a great man, but
he has too much class to read the tabloids. I read ’em. So whyn’t you
tell me what actually happened.”</p>
<p>To his surprise, once he got started, Sherman found it easy to tell
his story in this place, to this man. Like a priest, his confessor, this
dandy with a fighter’s nose, was from another order.</p>
<p>Every now and then a plastic intercom box on Killian’s desk would
give an electronic beep, and the receptionist’s faintly Latin voice
would say, “Mr. Killian…Mr. Scannesi on 3–0” or “Mr. Rothblatt on 3–1,”
and Killian would say, “Tell ’im I’ll call ’im back,” and Sherman would
resume. But then the machine beeped, and the voice said, “Mr. Leong on
3–0.”</p>
<p>“Tell ’im—I’ll take it.” Killian gave his hand a deprecating flap in
the air, as if to say, “This is nothing compared to what we’re talking
about, but I’ll have to talk to this person for half a second.”</p>
<p>“Ayyyy, Lee,” said Killian. “Whaddaya whaddaya?…No kiddin’?…Hey, Lee,
I was just reading a book about you…Well, not about you but about you
Leongs…Would I kid you? Whaddaya think, I want a hatchet in my
back?”</p>
<p>Sherman grew increasingly irritated. At the same time, he was
impressed. Apparently Killian was representing one of the defendants in
the Chinatown voting scandal.</p>
<p>Finally Killian hung up and turned to Sherman and said, “So you took
the car back to the garage and you exchanged a few words with the
attendant and you walked home.” This was no doubt to show that he hadn’t
been distracted by the interruption.</p>
<p>Sherman kept going, concluding with the visit of the two detectives,
Martin and Goldberg, to his apartment.</p>
<p>Killian leaned forward and said, “Awright. The first thing you gotta
understand is, from now on, you gotta keep your mouth shut. You
understand? You got nothing to gain, nothing, by talking about
this”—tawkin—“to anybody, I don’t care who it is. All that’s gonna
happen is, you’re gonna get jerked around some more like you did by
these two cops.”</p>
<p>“What should I have done? They were in the building. They knew I was
upstairs. If I refused to talk to them, that would be like a clear
indication I had something to hide.”</p>
<p>“All you hadda do was tell them, ‘Gentlemen, it’s nice to meet you,
you’re conducting an investigation, I have absolutely no experience in
this area, so I’m gonna turn you over to my attorney, good evening,
don’t let the doorknob hit you in the back on your way out.’”</p>
<p>“But even that—”</p>
<p>“It’s better’n what happened, right? As a matter of fact, they woulda
probably figured, Well, here’s this Park Avenue swell who’s too busy or
too above-it-all to talk to characters like us. He’s got people who do
things like that for him. It wouldn’t’ve prejudiced your case at all,
probably. From now on, it sure as hell won’t.” He started chuckling.
“The guy actually read your rights to you, hunh? I wish I coulda seen
it. The dumb fuck probably lives in a two-family in Massapequa, and he’s
sitting there in an apartment on Park Avenue in the Seventies, and he’s
gotta inform you that if you are unable to afford a lawyer, the state
will provide you one. He’s gotta read you the whole thing.”</p>
<p>Sherman was chilled by the man’s detached amusement. “All right,” he
said, “but what does it mean?”</p>
<p>“It means they’re trying to get evidence for a criminal charge.”</p>
<p>“What kind?”</p>
<p>“What kinda evidence or what kinda charge?”</p>
<p>“What kind of charge.”</p>
<p>“They have several possibilities. Assuming Lamb don’t
die”—don’t—“there’s reckless endangerment.”</p>
<p>“Is that the same as reckless driving?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s a felony. It’s a fairly serious felony. Or if they really
want to get hard-nosed about it, they could work on a theory of assault
with a dangerous weapon, meaning the car. If Lamb dies, that creates two
more possibilities. Manslaughter is one, and criminally negligent
homicide is the other, although all the time I was in the D.A.’s office
up there I never heard a charging anybody with criminally negligent
homicide unless there was drunk driving involved. On top a that they got
leaving the scene of an accident and failure to report an accident. Both
felonies.”</p>
<p>“But since I wasn’t driving the car at the time this fellow was hit,
can they bring any of these charges against me?”</p>
<p>“Before we get to that, let me explain something to you. Maybe they
can’t bring charges against anybody.”</p>
<p>“They can’t?” Sherman felt his entire nervous system quicken at this
first sign of hope.</p>
<p>“You looked your car over pretty carefully, right? No dents? No
blood? No tissue? No broken glass? Right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“It’s pretty obvious the kid wasn’t hit very hard. The emergency room
treated him for a broken wrist and let him go. Right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“The fact of the matter is, you don’t even know if your car hit him,
do you.”</p>
<p>“Well, I did hear something.”</p>
<p>“With all the shit that was going on at that moment, that coulda been
anything. You heard something. You didn’t see anything. You don’t really
know, do you?”</p>
<p>“Well…that’s true.”</p>
<p>“You beginning to see why I don’t want you to talk to anybody?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And I mean anybody. Okay? Now. Here’s another thing. Maybe it wasn’t
your car that hit him. Did that possibility ever occur to you? Maybe it
wasn’t any car. You don’t know. And they don’t know, the cops don’t
know. These stories in the newspaper are very strange. Here’s this big
case, supposedly, but nobody knows where this cockamamie hit’n’run’s
supposed’ve taken place. Bruckner Boulevard. Bruckner Boulevard’s five
miles long! They got no witnesses. What the kid told his mother is
hearsay. It don’t”—don’t—“mean a thing. They have no description of a
driver. Even if they could establish that it was your car that hit
him—they can’t arrest a car. One a the garage attendants coulda loaned
it to his sister-in-law’s nephew so he could go up to Fordham Road to
kiss his girlfriend good night. They don’t know. And you don’t know. As
a matter of fact, stranger things have happened.”</p>
<p>“But suppose the other boy comes forward? I swear to you, there was a
second boy, a big powerful fellow.”</p>
<p>“I believe you. It was a setup. They were gonna take you off. Yeah,
he could come forward, but it sounds to me like he has his reasons not
to. Judging by this story the mother tells, the kid didn’t mention him,
either.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Sherman, “but he could. I swear, I’m beginning to feel as
if I should preempt the situation and take the initiative and go to the
police with Maria—Mrs. Ruskin—and just tell them exactly what happened.
I mean, I don’t know about the law, but I feel morally certain that I
did the right thing and that she did the right thing in the situation we
were in.”</p>
<p>“Ayyyyyy!” said Killian. “You Wall Street honchos really are
gamblers! Ayyyyyy!! Whaddaya whaddaya!” Killian was grinning. Sherman
stared at him in astonishment. Killian must have detected it, because he
put on a perfectly serious face. “You got any idea what the D.A.’d do if
you just walked in and said, ‘Yeah, it was me and my girlfriend, who
lives on Fifth Avenue, in my car’? They’d devour you—de-vour you.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“The case is already a political football, and they got nothing to go
on. Reverend Bacon is yelling about it, it’s on TV, The City Light has
gone bananas over it, and it’s putting a lot of pressure on Abe Weiss,
who has an election coming up. I know Weiss very well. There is no real
world to Abe Weiss. There’s only what’s on TV and in the newspapers. But
I’ll tell you something else. They wouldn’t give you a break even if no
one was watching.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“You know what you do all day long when you work in the D.A.’s
Office? You prosecute people named Tiffany Latour and LeBaron Courtney
and Mestaffalah Shabazz and Camilio Rodriguez. You get so you’re dying
to get your hands on somebody with something on the ball. And if
somebody gives you a couple like you and your friend
Mrs. Ruskin—ayyyyyyyy, Biscuit City!”</p>
<p>The man seemed to have a horrible nostalgic enthusiasm for such a
catch.</p>
<p>“What would happen?”</p>
<p>“For a start, there’s no way in the world they wouldn’t arrest you,
and if I know Weiss, he’d make a big show of it. They might not be able
to hold you very long, but it would be extremely unpleasant. That’s
guaranteed.”</p>
<p>Sherman tried to imagine it. He couldn’t. His spirits hit bottom. He
let out a big sigh.</p>
<p>“Now you see why I don’t want you to talk to anybody? You get the
picture?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“But look, I’m not trying to depress you. My job right now is not to
defend you but to keep you from even having to be defended. I mean,
that’s assuming you decide to have me represent you. I’m not even gonna
talk about a fee at this point, because I don’t know what this is gonna
involve. If you’re lucky, I’ll find out this is a bullshit case.”</p>
<p>“How can you find out that?”</p>
<p>“The head of the Homicide Bureau in the Bronx D.A.’s Office is a guy
I started out with up there, Bernie Fitzgibbon.”</p>
<p>“And he’ll tell you?”</p>
<p>“I think he will. We’re friends. He’s a Donkey, just like me.”</p>
<p>“A donkey?”</p>
<p>“An Irishman.”</p>
<p>“But is that wise, letting them know I’ve hired a lawyer and I’m
worried? Won’t that put ideas in their heads?”</p>
<p>“Christ, they already”—awready—“got ideas in their head, and they
know you’re worried. If you weren’t worried after those two meatballs
came to see you, there’d have to be something wrong with you. But I can
take care a that. What you oughta start thinking about is your friend
Mrs. Ruskin.”</p>
<p>“That was what Freddy said.”</p>
<p>“Freddy was right. If I’m gonna take this case, I wanna talk to her,
and the sooner the better. You think she’d be willing to make a
statement?”</p>
<p>“A statement?”</p>
<p>“A sworn statement we could have witnessed.”</p>
<p>“Before I talked to Freddy, I would have said yes. Now I don’t know.
If I try to get her to make a sworn statement, in a legal setting, I
don’t know what she’ll do.”</p>
<p>“Well, one way or another, I’ll want to talk to her. Can you get hold
of her? I don’t mind calling her myself, as far as that goes.”</p>
<p>“No, it would be better if I did it.”</p>
<p>“One thing is, you don’t want her going around talking, either.”
Tawkin tawkin tawkin.</p>
<p>“Freddy tells me you went to the Yale Law School. When were you
there?”</p>
<p>“The late seventies,” said Killian.</p>
<p>“What did you think of it?”</p>
<p>“It was okay. Nobody there knew what the fuck I was talking about.”
Tawkin. “You might as well be from Afghanistan as Sunnyside, Queens. But
I liked it. It’s a nice place. It’s easy, as law schools go. They don’t
try to bury you in details. They give you the scholarly view, the
overview. You get the grand design. They’re very good at giving you
that. Yale is terrific for anything you wanna do, so long as it don’t
involve people with sneakers, guns, dope, lust, or sloth.”</p>
