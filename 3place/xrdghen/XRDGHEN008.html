<h4 id="catching-the-fish">7. Catching the Fish</h4>
<p>The telephone blasted Peter Fallow awake inside an egg with the shell
peeled away and only the membranous sac holding it intact. Ah! The
membranous sac was his head, and the right side of his head was on the
pillow, and the yolk was as heavy as mercury, and it rolled like
mercury, and it was pressing down on his right temple and his right eye
and his right ear. If he tried to get up to answer the telephone, the
yolk, the mercury, the poisoned mass, would shift and roll and rupture
the sac, and his brains would fall out.</p>
<p>The telephone was on the floor, in the corner, near the window, on
the brown carpet. The carpet was disgusting. Synthetic; the Americans
manufactured filthy carpet; Metalon, Streptolon, deep, shaggy, with a
feel that made his flesh crawl. Another explosion; he was looking
straight at it, a white telephone and a slimy white cord lying there in
a filthy shaggy brown nest of Streptolon. Behind the Venetian blinds the
sun was so bright it hurt his eyes. The room got light only between one
and two in the afternoon, when the sun moved between two buildings on
its trip across the southern sky. The other rooms, the bathroom, the
kitchen, and the living room, never got any sun at all. The kitchen and
the bathroom didn’t even have windows. When one turned on the light in
the bathroom, which had a plastic tub-and-shower-stall module—module!—a
single molded unit that deflected slightly when he stepped into the
tub—when one turned on the light in the bathroom, a ceiling fan went on
up above a metal grille in the ceiling to provide ventilation. The fan
created a grinding din and a trememdous vibration. So when he first got
up, he no longer turned on the light in the bathroom. He depended solely
on the sickly blue dawn provided by the overhead fluorescent light in
the passageway outside. More than once he had gone to work without
shaving.</p>
<p>His head still on the pillow, Fallow kept staring at the telephone,
which continued to explode. He really had to get a table to put by the
bed, if one could call a mattress and springs on one of those American
adjustable metal frames, good for cutting off knuckles and fingers
mainly when one tried to adjust them—if one could call this a bed. The
telephone looked slimy and filthy lying there on the filthy carpet. But
he never invited anybody up here, except for girls, and that was always
late in the evening when he had been through two or three bottles of
wine and didn’t give a damn. That wasn’t really true, was it? When he
brought a girl up here, he always saw this pathetic hole through her
eyes, at least for a moment. The thought of wine and a girl tripped a
wire in his brain, and a shudder of remorse went through his nervous
system. Something had happened last night. These days he often woke up
like this, poisonously hung over, afraid to move an inch and filled with
an abstract feeling of despair and shame. Whatever he had done was
submerged like a monster at the bottom of a cold dark lake. His memory
had drowned in the night, and he could feel only the icy despair. He had
to look for the monster deductively, fathom by fathom. Sometimes he knew
that whatever it had been, he couldn’t face it, and he would decide to
turn away from it forever, and just then something, some stray detail,
would send out a signal, and the beast would come popping to the surface
on its own and show him its filthy snout.</p>
<p>He did remember how it started, namely, at Leicester’s, where, like
many of the Englishmen who frequented the place, he managed to insinuate
himself at the table of an American who could be counted on to pick up
the bill without pouting over it, in this case a fat fellow named Aaron
Gutwillig, who had recently sold a simulator-leasing company for twelve
million dollars and liked to be invited to parties given by the English
colony and the Italian colony in New York. Another Yank, a crude but
amusing little man named Benny Grillo, who produced so-called news
documentaries for television, had a head on and wanted to go downtown to
the Limelight, a discotheque set up in what used to be an Episcopal
church. Grillo was good for the bill at the Limelight, and so he had
gone down there with Grillo and two American model girls and Franco di
Nodini, who was an Italian journalist, and Tony Moss, whom he had known
at the University of Kent, and Caroline Heftshank, who had just arrived
from London and was absolutely petrified with fear of street crime in
New York, which she read about every day in London, and she jumped at
every shadow, which was funny at first. The two model girls had ordered
roast-beef sandwiches at Leicester’s, and they pulled the meat out and
dangled it above their mouths and ate it out of their fingers. Caroline
Heftshank jumped a lot when they got out of the taxi in front of the
Limelight. The place was practically ringed by black youths wearing
enormous sneakers and perching on the old iron church fence, eyeing the
drunks and heads going in and out of the door. Inside, the Limelight
looked unusually grotesque, and Fallow felt unusually witty, drunk, and
charming. So many transvestites! So many supremely repulsive punkers! So
many pasty-faced little American girls with ortho-perfect teeth and
silver lipstick and wet-night eye makeup! Such loud seamless endless
metallic music and such foggy grainy videotapes up on the screens full
of morose skinny boys and smoke bombs! Deeper and deeper into the lake
it had all gone. They were in a taxi going back and forth across streets
in the West Fifties looking for a place with a galvanized-metal door,
called the Cup. A black studded rubber floor, and some loathsome Irish
boys with no shirts on, or they looked Irish, spraying beer out of cans
over everybody; and then some girls with no shirts on. Ah. Something had
happened in front of some people in a room. Insofar as he had a true
memory of it, he did remember that…Why did he do these things?…The house
in Canterbury…the locker room at Cross Keys…He could see himself as he
looked back then…his Victorian-picture-book blond hair, of which he had
been so proud…his long pointed nose, his long slender jaw, his spindly
body, always too thin for his great height, of which he had also been so
proud…his spindly body…A ripple…The monster was heading up from the
bottom of the lake! In a moment…its filthy snout!</p>
<p>Can’t face it—</p>
<p>The telephone exploded again. He opened his eyes and squinted at the
sun-drenched modern squalor, and with his eyes open it was even worse.
With his eyes open—the immediate future. Such hopelessness! Such icy
despair! He squinted and shuddered and closed his eyes again. The
snout!</p>
<p>He opened them immediately. This thing he had done when he was very
drunk—in addition to despair and remorse, he now felt fear.</p>
<p>The ringing telephone began to alarm him. Suppose it was The City
Light. After the Dead Mouse’s last lecture, he had sworn to himself to
be at the office by ten o’clock every morning, and it was now after one.
In that case—he’d better not answer it. No—if he didn’t answer the
telephone, he would sink to the bottom forever, along with the monster.
He rolled out of the bed and put his feet on the floor, and the horrible
yolk shifted. He was thrown into a violent headache. He wanted to vomit,
but he knew it would hurt his head too much for him to possibly allow it
to happen. He started toward the telephone. He sank to his knees and
then to all fours. He crawled to the telephone, picked up the receiver,
and then lay down on the carpet, hoping the yolk would settle again.</p>
<p>“Hello,” he said.</p>
<p>“Peter?” Pee-tuh? Thank God, it was an English voice.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Peter, you’re gurgling. I woke you up, didn’t I. This is Tony.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no, no, no. I’m—I was, I was in the other room. I’m working
at home today.” He realized that his voice had sunk to a furtive
baritone.</p>
<p>“Well, you do a very good imitation of having just woke up.”</p>
<p>“You don’t believe me, do you?” Thank God it was Tony. Tony was an
Englishman who had come to work on The City Light at the same time he
had. They were fellow commandos in this gross country.</p>
<p>“Of course I believe you. But that puts me in the minority just now.
If I were you, I’d come down here as soon as I could.”</p>
<p>“Ummmmmm. Yes.”</p>
<p>“The Mouse just came over and asked me where you were. Not out of
curiosity, either. He acted extremely pissed.”</p>
<p>“What did you tell him?”</p>
<p>“I told him you were at the Surrogate’s Court.”</p>
<p>“Ummmm. Not to pry, but what am I doing there?”</p>
<p>“Great Christ, Peter, I really did get you out of bed, didn’t I? That
Lacey Putney business.”</p>
<p>“Ummmmmmm. Lacey Putney.” Pain, nausea, and sleep rolled through
Fallow’s head like a Hawaiian wave. His head was flat on the carpet. The
poisonous yolk sloshed about terribly. “Ummmmmmmmmmm.”</p>
<p>“Don’t fade out on me, Peter. I’m not joking. I think you should come
down here and put in an appearance.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know I know I know I know. Thanks, Tony. You’re absolutely
right.”</p>
<p>“Are you coming?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Even as he said it, he knew what it was going to feel like to
try to stand up.</p>
<p>“And do me a favor.”</p>
<p>“Anything.”</p>
<p>“Try to remember that you were at the Surrogate’s Court. The Lacey
Putney estate. Not that the Mouse necessarily believed me. But, you
know.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Lacey Putney. Thanks, Tony.”</p>
<p>Fallow hung up, got up off the floor, staggered into the Venetian
blinds, and cut his lip. The slats were the narrow metal ones the Yanks
liked. They were like blades. He wiped the blood off his lip with the
back of his index finger. He couldn’t hold his head up straight. The
mercury yolk ruined his sense of balance. He lurched to the bathroom and
entered by the tubercular blue dawn of the fluorescent light in the
passageway outside. In the mirror on the medicine cabinet door, in this
diseased light, the blood on his lip looked purple. That was all right.
He could live with purple blood. But if he turned on the light in the
bathroom, he was finished.</p>
<p>Rows of diode-light computer terminals in putty-gray 2001 sci-fi
casings lent the city room of The City Light a gloss of order and
modernity. It never survived a second glance. The desks were covered in
the usual litter of paper, plastic cups, books, manuals, almanacs,
magazines, and sooty ashtrays. The usual shell-backed young men and
women sat at the keyboards. A numb dull clattering—thuk thuk thuk thuk
thuk thuk thuk thuk thuk thuk thuk thuk thuk—rose from the keyboards, as
if an immense mah-jongg tournament was in progress. The reporters,
rewrite men, and copy editors were hunched over in the age-old way of
journalists. Every few seconds a head would straighten up, as if coming
up for air, and yell out something about slugs, headline counts, or
story lengths. But not even the excitement of deadline pressure could
survive for long. A rear door opened, and a Greek wearing a white
uniform came staggering in carrying a prodigious tray full of coffee and
soda containers, boxes of doughnuts, cheese Danishes, onion rolls,
crullers, every variety of muck and lard known to the takeout food
business, and half the room deserted the computer consoles and descended
upon him, rooting about the tray like starving weevils.</p>
<p>Fallow took advantage of this hiatus to make his way across the room
toward his cubicle. Out in the middle of the field of computer
terminals, he stopped and, with an air of professional scrutiny, picked
up a copy of the second edition, which had just been brought upstairs.
Below the logo—THE CITY LIGHT—the front page consisted of enormous
capital letters running down the right side—</p>
<p>Scalp</p>
<p>Grandma,</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>Rob Her</p>
<p>—and a photograph running down the left. The photograph was a cropped
blowup of the sort of smiling lineless portrait that studios produce. It
was a picture of a woman named Carolina Pérez, fifty-five years old and
not particularly grandmotherly, with a luxuriant head of black hair
pulled up behind in the old-fashioned Lady of Spain style.</p>
<p>Christ God! Scalping her must have been an undertaking! Had he been
feeling better, Fallow would have paid a silent tribute to the
extraordinary esthétique de l’abattoir that enabled these shameless
devils, his employers, his compatriots, his fellow Englishmen, his
fellow progeny of Shakespeare and Milton, to come up with things like
this day after day. Just think of the fine sense of gutter syntax that
inspired them to create a headline that was all verbs and objects, with
the subject missing, the better to make you claw your way inside these
smeary black pages to find out what children of evil were fiendish
enough to complete the sentence! Just think of the maggot’s perseverance
that enabled some reporter to invade chez Pérez and extract a picture of
Granny that made you feel the bloody act in your fingertips—in your very
shoulder joints! Just think of the anticlimax of “scalp Grandma”…“then
rob her.” The pointless brilliant anticlimax! Christ, if they’d had more
room, they would have added, “then leave all the lights on in her
kitchen.”</p>
<p>At the moment, however, he was too poisonously ill to enjoy it. No,
he stood there staring at this latest bit of tabloid genius only to
establish the fact, for all to see—and most especially, he hoped, the
Dead Mouse himself—that he was on the premises and interested in little
else in the world other than the New York City Light.</p>
<p>Holding the newspaper in his hands and staring at the front page, as
if transfixed by the virtuosity of it, he walked the rest of the way
across the room and entered his cubicle. It consisted of four-foot-high
walls of particleboard in a sickly salmon color, a so-called work
station with little high-tech curves at the corners, fencing in a gray
metal desk, the ubiquitous computer terminal and keyboard, a plastic
desk chair molded in an unpleasant orthopedic fashion and a modular
plastic coatrack, which snapped ingeniously onto the modular wall. It
was already cracked in the stem. On the rack hung a single drab garment,
Peter Fallow’s raincoat, which never left the cubicle.</p>
<p>Just by the coatrack was a window, and he could see his reflection.
Head on, he looked a young and handsome thirty-six rather than fortyish
and gone to seed. Head on, his widow’s peak and the longish wavy blond
hair that flowed back from it still looked…well, Byronic…rather than a
bit lonely on the dome of his skull. Yes, at this head-on angle…it was
going to be all right! His long thin nose looked patrician from top to
bottom rather than too bulbous in the tip. His big cleft chin did not
look overly compromised by the jowls that were forming on either side.
His navy blazer, which had been made by Blades eight—no, ten!—years ago
was getting a little…shiny…on the lapels…but he could probably raise the
nap with one of those wire brushes…He had the beginnings of a belly and
was getting too fleshy in the hips and thighs. But this would be no
problem now that he was finished with drinking. Never again. He would
begin an exercise regimen tonight. Or tomorrow, in any case; he felt too
bilious to think about tonight. It wouldn’t be this pathetic American
business of jogging, either. It would be something clean, crisp, brisk,
strenuous…English. He thought of medicine balls and exercise ladders and
leather horses and Indian clubs and pulley weights and parallel bars and
stout ropes with leather bindings on the end, and then he realized that
these were the apparatus of the gymnasium at Cross Keys, the school he
had attended prior to the University of Kent. Dear God…twenty years ago.
But he was still only thirty-six, and he was six-foot-two, and he had a
perfectly sound physique, fundamentally.</p>
<p>He pulled in his stomach and drew a deep breath. It made him feel
woozy. He picked up the telephone and put the receiver to his ear. Look
busy! That was the main idea. He found the dial tone soothing. He wished
he could crawl inside the receiver and float on his back in the dial
tone and let the hum of it wash over his nerve endings. How easy it
would be to put his head down on the desk and close his eyes and catch
forty winks. Perhaps he could get away with it if he put one side of his
face down on the desk, with the back of his head to the city room, and
kept the telephone over his other ear as if he were talking. No, it
would still look strange. Perhaps…</p>
<p>Oh, Christ God. An American named Robert Goldman, one of the
reporters, was heading for the cubicle. Goldman had on a necktie with
vivid red, yellow, black, and sky-blue diagonal stripes. The Yanks
called these bogus regimental ties “rep” ties. The Yanks always wore
neckties that leapt out in front of their shirts, as if to announce the
awkwardness to follow. Two weeks ago he had borrowed a hundred dollars
from Goldman. He had told him he had to repay a gambling debt by
nightfall—backgammon—the Bracers’ Club—fast European crowd. The Yanks
had very big eyes for stories of Rakes and Aristocrats. Since then, the
little shit had already pestered him three times for the money, as if
his future on this earth turned on a hundred dollars. The receiver still
at his ear, Fallow glanced at the approaching figure, and the blazing
tie that heralded him, with contempt. Like more than one Englishman in
New York, he looked upon Americans as hopeless children whom Providence
had perversely provided with this great swollen fat fowl of a continent.
Any way one chose to relieve them of their riches, short of violence,
was sporting, if not morally justifiable, since they would only squander
it in some tasteless and useless fashion, in any event.</p>
<p>Fallow began talking into the receiver, as if deep in conversation.
He searched his poisoned brain for the sort of one-sided dialogue
playwrights have to come up with for telephone scenes.</p>
<p>“What’s that?…You say the surrogate refuses to allow the stenographer
to give us a transcript? Well, you tell him…Right, right…Of course…It’s
an absolute violation…No, no…Now listen carefully…”</p>
<p>The necktie—and Goldman—were standing right beside him. Peter Fallow
kept his eyes down and lifted one hand, as if to say, “Please! This call
cannot be interrupted.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Pete,” said Goldman.</p>
<p>Pete! he said, and not very cheerily, either. Pete! The very sound
set Fallow’s teeth on edge. This…appalling…Yank…familiarity! And
cuteness! The Yanks!—with their Arnies and Buddies and Hanks and…Petes!
And this lubberly gauche lout with his screaming necktie has the gall to
walk into one’s office while one is on the telephone, because he’s a
nervous wreck over his pathetic hundred dollars!—and call one Pete!</p>
<p>Fallow screwed his face into a look of great intensity and began
talking a mile a minute.</p>
<p>“So!…You tell the surrogate and the stenographer that we want the
transcript by noon tomorrow!…Of course!…It’s obvious!…This is something
her barrister has cooked up! They’re all thick as thieves over
there!”</p>
<p>“It’s ‘judge,’” said Goldman tonelessly.</p>
<p>Fallow flicked his eyes up toward the American with a furious black
look.</p>
<p>Goldman stared back with a faintly ironic twist to his lips.</p>
<p>“They don’t say ‘stenographer,’ they say ‘court reporter.’ And they
don’t say ‘barrister,’ although they’ll know what you mean.”</p>
<p>Fallow closed his eyes and his lips into three tight lines and shook
his head and flapped his hand, as if confronted by an intolerable
display of impudence.</p>
<p>But when he opened his eyes, Goldman was still there. Goldman looked
down at him and put a look of mock excitement on his face and raised
both hands and lifted his ten fingers straight up in front of Fallow and
then made two fists and popped the ten fingers straight up again and
repeated this gesture ten times—and said, “One hundred big ones, Pete,”
and walked back out into the city room.</p>
<p>The impudence! The impudence! Once it was clear the impudent little
wet smack wasn’t returning, Fallow put down the receiver and stood up
and went over to the coatrack. He had vowed—but Christ God! What he had
just been subjected to was…just…a…bit…much. Without removing it from the
hook, he opened the raincoat and put his head inside it, as if he were
inspecting the seams. Then he brought the raincoat around his shoulders
so that the upper half of his body disappeared from view. It was the
kind of raincoat that has slash pockets with openings on the inside as
well as the outside, so that in the rain you can get to your jacket or
pants without unbuttoning the coat in front. Beneath his poplin tent,
Fallow felt around for the inside opening of the left-hand pocket. From
the pocket he withdrew a pint-sized camping canteen.</p>
<p>He unscrewed the top, put the opening to his lips, and took two long
gulps of vodka and waited for the jolt in his stomach. It hit and then
bounced up through his body and his head like a heat wave. He screwed
the top back on and slipped the canteen back in the pocket and emerged
from the raincoat. His face was on fire. There were tears in his eyes.
He took a wary look toward the city room, and—</p>
<p>Oh shit.</p>
<p>—the Dead Mouse was looking straight at him. Fallow didn’t dare so
much as blink, much less smile. He wanted to provoke no response in the
Mouse whatsoever. He turned away as if he hadn’t seen him. Was vodka
truly odorless? He devoutly hoped so. He sat down at the desk and picked
up the telephone again and moved his lips. The dial tone hummed, but he
was too nervous to surrender himself to it. Had the Mouse seen him under
the raincoat? And if he had, would he guess anything? Oh, how different
that little nip had been from those glorious toasts of six months ago!
Oh, what glorious prospects he had pissed away! He could see the
scene…the dinner at the Mouse’s grotesque flat on Park Avenue…the
pompous, overformal invitation cards with the raised script: Sir Gerald
Steiner and Lady Steiner request the pleasure of your company at dinner
in honour of Mr. Peter Fallow (dinner and Mr. Peter Fallow written in by
hand)…the ludicrous museum of Bourbon Louis furniture and threadbare
Aubusson rugs the Dead Mouse and Lady Mouse had put together on Park
Avenue. Nevertheless, what a heady evening that had been! Everyone at
the table had been English. There were only three or four Americans in
the upper echelons of The City Light anyway, and none was invited. There
were dinners like this all over the East Side of Manhattan every night,
he had soon discovered, lavish parties that were all English or all
French or all Italian or all European; no Americans, in any case. One
had the sense of a very rich and very suave secret legion that had
insinuated itself into the cooperative apartment houses of Park Avenue
and Fifth Avenue, from there to pounce at will upon the Yanks’ fat fowl,
to devour at leisure the last plump white meat on the bones of
capitalism.</p>
<p>In England, Fallow had always thought of Gerald Steiner as “that Jew
Steiner,” but on this night all base snobberies had vanished. They were
comrades-in-arms in the secret legion, in the service of Great Britain’s
wounded chauvinism. Steiner had told the table what a genius Fallow was.
Steiner had been swept off his feet by a series on country life among
the rich that Fallow had done for the Dispatch. It had been full of
names and titles and helicopters and perplexing perversions (“that thing
with the cup”) and costly diseases, and all of it was so artfully
contrived as to be fireproof in terms of libel. It had been Fallow’s
greatest triumph as a journalist (his only one, in point of fact), and
Steiner couldn’t imagine how he had pulled it off. Fallow knew exactly
how, but he managed to hide the memory of it with the embroideries of
vanity. Every spicy morsel in the series came from a girl he was seeing
at that time, a resentful little girl named Jeannie Brokenborough, a
rare-book dealer’s daughter who ran with the Country Set as the social
runt in the stable. When little Miss Brokenborough moved on, Fallow’s
daily magic vanished with her.</p>
<p>Steiner’s invitation to New York had arrived just in time, although
Fallow did not see it that way. Like every writer before him who has
ever scored a triumph, even on the level of the London Dispatch, Fallow
was willing to give no credit to luck. Would he have any trouble
repeating his triumph in a city he knew nothing about, in a country he
looked upon as a stupendous joke? Well…why should he? His genius had
only begun to flower. This was only journalism, after all, a cup of tea
on the way to his eventual triumph as a novelist. Fallow’s father,
Ambrose Fallow, was a novelist, a decidedly minor novelist, it had
turned out. His father and his mother were from East Anglia and had been
the sort of highly educated young people of good blood and good bone who
after the Second World War had been susceptible to the notion that
literary sensitivity could make one an aristocrat. The notion of being
aristocratic was never far from their minds, nor from Fallow’s. Fallow
had tried to make up for his lack of money by being a wit and a rake.
These aristocratic accomplishments had gained him nothing more than an
insecure place in the tail of the comet of the smart crowd in
London.</p>
<p>Now, as part of the Steiner brigade in New York, Fallow was also
going to make his fortune in the fat white-meat New World.</p>
<p>People wondered why Steiner, who had no background in journalism, had
come to the United States and undertaken the extremely costly business
of setting up a tabloid newspaper. The smart explanation was that The
City Light had been created as the weapon of attack or reprisal for
Steiner’s much more important financial investments in the United
States, where he was already known as “the Dread Brit.” But Fallow knew
it was the other way around. The “serious” investments existed at the
service of The City Light. Steiner had been reared, schooled, drilled,
and handed a fortune by Old Steiner, a loud and pompous self-made
financier who wanted to turn his son into a proper British peer, not
just a rich Jewish boy. Steiner fils had become the well-mannered,
well-educated, well-dressed, proper mouse his father required. He had
never found the courage to rebel. Now, late in life, he had discovered
the world of the tabloids. His daily dive into the mud—SCALP GRANDMA,
THEN ROB HER—brought him inexpressible joy. Uhuru! Free at last! Every
day he rolled up his sleeves and plunged into the life of the city room.
Some days he wrote headlines himself. It was possible that he had
written SCALP GRANDMA, although that had the inimitable touch of his
managing editor, a Liverpool prole named Brian Highridge. Despite the
many victories of his career, however, he had never been a social
success. This was largely due to his personality, but anti-Jewish
sentiment was not dead, either, and he could not discount it altogether.
In any case, he looked with genuine relish upon the prospect of Peter
Fallow building a nice toasty bonfire under all the nobs who looked down
on him. And so he waited…</p>
<p>And waited. At first, Fallow’s expense account, which was far larger
than any other City Light writer’s (not counting the rare foreign
assignment), caused no concern. After all, to penetrate the high life
one had to live it, to some extent. The staggering lunch bills, dinner
bills, and bar bills were followed by amusing reports of the swath
Mr. Peter Fallow was cutting as a jolly Brit giant in fashionable low
dives. After a while they were not amusing anymore. No great coup in the
chronicling of the high life was forthcoming from this particular
soldier of fortune. More than once, Fallow had turned in stories only to
find them reduced to unsigned column items the following day. Steiner
had called him in for several progress reports. These chats had become
chillier and chillier. His pride wounded, Fallow had begun entertaining
his colleagues by referring to Steiner, the renowned “Dread Brit,” as
the Dead Mouse. Everyone seemed to enjoy this enormously. After all,
Steiner did have a long pointed nose like a mouse and no chin and a
crumpled little mouth and large ears and tiny hands and feet and eyes in
which the light seemed to have gone out and a tired little voice.
Recently, however, Steiner had become downright cold and abrupt, and
Fallow began to wonder if in fact he somehow had learned of the Dead
Mouse crack.</p>
<p>He looked up…there was Steiner, six feet away in the doorway to the
cubicle, looking straight at him, one hand resting on a modular
wall.</p>
<p>“Nice of you to pay us a visit, Fallow.”</p>
<p>Fallow! It was the most contemptuous sort of school-proctor stuff!
Fallow was speechless.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Steiner, “what do you have for me?”</p>
<p>Fallow opened his mouth. He ransacked his poisoned brain in search of
the facile conversation for which he was renowned and came up gasping
and sputtering.</p>
<p>“Well!—you’ll remember—the Lacey Putney estate—I mentioned that—if
I’m not mistaken—they’ve tried to give us a very hard time at the
Surrogate’s Court, the—the—” Damn! Was it stenographers or something
about reporters? What had Goldman said? “Well!—I hardly—but I’ve really
got the whole thing now! It’s just a matter of—I can tell you—this is
really going to break open…”</p>
<p>Steiner didn’t even wait for him to finish.</p>
<p>“I sincerely hope so, Fallow,” he said quite ominously. “I sincerely
hope so.”</p>
<p>Then he left and plunged back into his beloved tabloid city room.</p>
<p>Fallow sank down into his chair. He managed to wait almost a full
minute before he got up and disappeared into his raincoat.</p>
<p>Albert Teskowitz was not what Kramer or any other prosecutor would
call a threat when it came to swaying a jury with the magic of his
summations. Emotional crescendos were beyond him, and even what
rhetorical momentum he could manage was quickly undercut by his
appearance. His posture was so bad that every woman on a jury, or every
good mother, in any case, was aching to cry out, “Hold your shoulders
back!” As for his delivery, it wasn’t that he didn’t prepare his
summations, it was that he obviously prepared them on a yellow legal
pad, which lay on top of the defense table.</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, the defendant has three children, ages six,
seven, and nine,” Teskowitz was saying, “and they are in the courtroom
at this moment, awaiting the outcome of this trial.” Teskowitz avoided
calling his client by name. If he could have said Herbert Cantrell,
Mr. Cantrell, or even Herbert, it would have been all right, but Herbert
wouldn’t put up even with Herbert. “My name is not Herbert,” he told
Teskowitz when he first took the case. “I am not your limo driver. My
name is Herbert 92X.”</p>
<p>“It was not some criminal sitting in the Doubleheader Grill that
afternoon,” Teskowitz continued, “but a workingman with a job and a
family.” He hesitated and turned his face upward with the far, far,
far-off expression of someone about to have an epileptic seizure. “A job
and a family,” he repeated dreamily, a thousand miles away. Then he
turned on his heels and went to the defense table and bent his already
stooped torso at the waist and stared at his yellow legal pad with his
head cocked to one side, like a bird eyeing a wormhole. He held that
pose for what seemed like an eternity and then walked back to the jury
box and said, “He was not an aggressor. He was not attempting to settle
a score or make a score or get even with anybody. He was a workingman
with a job and a family who was concerned with only one thing, and that
he had every right to, which was his life was in danger.” The little
lawyer’s eyes opened up like a time exposure again, and he did an
about-face and walked back to the defense table and stared at the yellow
pad some more. Bent over the way he was, he had a silhouette like a
slop-sink spigot…A slop-sink spigot…a dog with the chuck horrors…Rogue
images began to seep into the jurors’ minds. They began to be aware of
things such as the film of dust on the huge courtroom windows and the
way the dying afternoon sun lit up the dust, as if it were that kind of
plastic they make toys out of, the kind that picks up light, and every
housekeeper on the jury, even the bad ones, wondered why somebody didn’t
wash those windows. They wondered about many things and about almost
anything other than what Albert Teskowitz was saying about Herbert 92X,
and above all they wondered about the yellow legal pad, which seemed to
have Teskowitz’s poor bent scrawny neck on a leash.</p>
<p>“…and find this defendant…not guilty.” When Teskowitz finally
completed his summation, they weren’t even sure he had finished. Their
eyes were pinned on the yellow legal pad. They expected it to jerk him
back to the table once more. Even Herbert 92X, who hadn’t missed a beat,
looked puzzled.</p>
<p>Just then a low chant began in the courtroom.</p>
<p>“Yo-ohhhhhhh…” It came from over here.</p>
<p>“Yo-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh…” It came from over there.</p>
<p>Kaminsky, the fat officer, started it, and then Bruzzielli, the
clerk, picked it up, and even Sullivan, the court reporter, who was
sitting at his stenotype machine just below the brow of Kovitsky’s
bench, joined in with his own low discreet version. “Yo-ohhh.”</p>
<p>Without batting an eye Kovitsky tapped his gavel and declared a
thirty-minute recess.</p>
<p>Kramer didn’t think twice about it. It was wagon-train time at the
fortress, that was all. Wagon-training was standard practice. If a trial
was likely to run past sundown, then you had to wagon-train. Everybody
knew that. This trial was going to have to continue past sundown,
because the defense had just completed its summation, and the judge
couldn’t adjourn for the night without letting the prosecution make its
summation. So it was time to wagon-train.</p>
<p>During a wagon-train recess, all employees who had driven to work and
who had to stay on at the courthouse after dark because of the trial got
up and went outside and headed for their cars in the parking lots. The
judge, Kovitsky, was no exception. Today he had driven himself to work,
and he went to his robing room, which was through a door to one side of
the bench, where he took off his black robe and headed for the parking
lot, like everybody else.</p>
<p>Kramer had no car, and he couldn’t afford to pay eight or ten dollars
to take a gypsy cab home. The gypsies—many of them driven by recent
African immigrants, from places like Nigeria and Senegal—were the only
cabs that came near the courthouse day or night, except for the taxis
that brought fares from Manhattan to the Bronx County Building. The
drivers switched on the OFF DUTY sign even before the brake pedal took
its first bite of friction out of the drum, dropped off their fares, and
then sped off. No, with a slight chill around the heart, Kramer realized
that this was one of those nights when he would have to walk three
blocks to the 161st Street subway station in the dark and stand there
and wait on what was rated as one of the ten most dangerous subway
platforms in the city, in terms of crime, and hope there was a car full
enough of people so that he wouldn’t be picked off by the wolf packs
like some stray calf from the herd. He figured the Nike running shoes
gave him at least half a fighting chance. For a start, they were
camouflage. On the subway in the Bronx, a pair of Johnston andandandand
Murphy leather business shoes labeled you as a prime target right off
the bat. It was like wearing a sign around your neck saying ROB ME. The
Nikes and the AandandandandP shopping bag would at least make them think
twice. They might take him for a plainclothes cop on the way home. There
no longer existed a plainclothes cop in the Bronx who didn’t wear
sneakers. The other thing was, if the evil shit ever did rain down, with
the Nikes he could at least run for it or dig in and fight. He wasn’t
about to mention any of this to Andriutti and Caughey. Andriutti he
didn’t really give a damn about, but Caughey’s contempt he knew he
couldn’t stand. Caughey was Irish and would have sooner taken a bullet
in the face than wear fucking camouflage on the subway.</p>
<p>As the jurors headed back to the jury room, Kramer stared at Miss
Shelly Thomas until he could feel the smoothness of her brown lipstick
as she walked past, and she looked at him for an instant—with just a
trace of a smile!—and he began to agonize over how she would get home,
and there was nothing he could do about it, since of course he couldn’t
go near her and convey any sort of message to her. Even with all this
yo-ohhhhhing no one ever informed the jury or the witnesses about
wagon-training, not that a juror would be allowed to go to a parking lot
during a trial recess, in any case.</p>
<p>Kramer went downstairs to the Walton Avenue entrance, to stretch his
legs, get some air, and watch the parade. Out on the sidewalk one group,
including Kovitsky and his law clerk, Mel Herskowitz, had already
formed. The court officers were with them, standing around like troop
leaders. The big tub, Kaminsky, was on his tiptoes, craning around, to
see if there was anybody else who wanted to come along. The parking lot
favored by the courthouse regulars was just over the crest of the Grand
Concourse and down the slope, on 161st Street, in an enormous dirt pit
across from the Criminal Courts Building. The pit, which occupied an
entire city block, had been dug as the excavation for a building project
that never went up.</p>
<p>The group assembled with Kaminsky in the lead and another court
officer bringing up the rear. The court officers had their .38s plainly
visible on their hips. The little contingent headed off bravely into
Indian country. It was about 5:45. Walton Avenue was quiet. There wasn’t
much of a rush hour in the Bronx. The parking spaces on Walton Avenue
next to the fortress were at a 90-degree angle to the curb. Only a
handful of cars remained. There were ten reserved spaces near the
entrance, for Abe Weiss, Louis Mastroiani, and other supreme bearers of
the Power in the Bronx. The guard at the door put Day-Glo-red plastic
traffic cones in the spaces when the appointed users were away. Kramer
noticed that Abe Weiss’s car was still there. There was one other, which
he didn’t recognize, but the other spaces were vacant. Kramer walked
back and forth on the sidewalk near the entrance with his head down and
his hands in his pockets, concentrating on his summation. He was here to
speak for the one principal in this case who could not speak for
himself, namely, the victim, the deceased, Nestor Cabrillo, a good
father and a good citizen of the Bronx. It all fell into place very
easily. Brick-wall arguments wouldn’t be enough, however; not for what
he had to achieve. This summation had to move her, move her to tears or
awe or, at the very least, to utter inebriation from a crime-high in the
Bronx, featuring a tough young assistant D.A. with a golden tongue and a
fearless delivery, not to mention a hell of a powerful neck. So he
walked up and down the sidewalk outside the Walton Avenue entrance to
the fortress, cooking Herbert 92X’s goose and tensing his
sternocleidomastoid muscles while a vision of the girl with brown
lipstick danced in his head.</p>
<p>Pretty soon the first of the cars arrived. Here came Kovitsky in his
huge ancient white boat, the Pontiac Bonneville. He nosed into one of
the reserved spaces near the door. Thwop! The huge door torqued, and he
got out, an inconspicuous-looking little bald man in a very ordinary
gray suit. And then here came Bruzzielli in some little Japanese sports
car that he seemed about to burst out of. Then Mel Herskowitz and
Sullivan, the court reporter. Then Teskowitz in a new Buick Regal. Shit,
thought Kramer. Even Al Teskowitz can afford a car. Even him, an 18b
lawyer, and I’m going home on the subway! Pretty soon practically every
space on the Walton Avenue side of the building was filled by the
regulars. The last car to pull in was Kaminsky’s own. He had given the
other court officer a lift back. The two of them got out, and Kaminsky
spotted Kramer and broke into a good-natured grin and sang out,
“Yo-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Yo ho ho,” said Kramer.</p>
<p>The wagon train. “Yo-ohhhhhhh” was the cry of John Wayne, the hero
and chief scout, signaling the pioneers to move the wagons. This was
Indian country and bandit country, and it was time to put the wagons in
a circle for the night. Anybody who thought he was going to be able to
walk two blocks from Gibraltar to the parking lot after dark in the
Four-four and drive peacefully home to Mom and Buddy and Sis was playing
the game of life with half a deck.</p>
<p>Later in the day, Sherman got a call from Arnold Parch’s secretary
saying Parch wanted to see him. Parch had the title executive vice
president, but he was not the sort who very often summoned people from
the trading floor into his office.</p>
<p>Parch’s office was, naturally, smaller than Lopwitz’s, but it had the
same terrific view to the west, out over the Hudson River and New
Jersey. In contrast to Lopwitz’s office, with its antiques, Parch’s was
done with modern furniture and large modern paintings of the sort that
Maria and her husband liked.</p>
<p>Parch, who was a great smiler, smiled and motioned to a gray
upholstered chair that was so sleek and close to the floor it looked
like a submarine surfacing. Sherman sank down until he had the sensation
of being below floor level. Parch sat down in an identical chair across
from him. Sherman was conscious mainly of legs, his and Parch’s. In
Sherman’s line of vision, Parch’s chin barely cleared the tops of his
knees.</p>
<p>“Sherman,” said the smiling face behind the kneecaps, “I just
received a call from Oscar Suder in Columbus, Ohio, and he is really
pissed off about these United Fragrance bonds.”</p>
<p>Sherman was astounded. He wanted to lift his head up higher, but he
couldn’t. “He is? And he called you? What did he say?”</p>
<p>“He said you called him and sold him three million bonds at 102. He
also said you told him to buy them fast, because they were heading up.
This morning they’re down to 100.”</p>
<p>“Par! I don’t believe it!”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a fact, and they’re going lower, if they’re going
anywhere. Standard andandandand Poor’s just knocked them down from
double A to triple B.”</p>
<p>“I don’t…believe it, Arnold! I saw them go from 103 to 102.5 day
before yesterday, and I checked with Research, and everything was okay.
Then yesterday they went down to 102, then 101 7/8, and then they came
back up to 102. So I figured other traders were spotting it, and that’s
when I called Oscar. They were heading back up. It was a damned good
bargain at 102. Oscar had been looking for something over 9, and here
was 9.75, almost 10, double A.”</p>
<p>“But did you check with Research yesterday, before you got them for
Oscar?”</p>
<p>“No, but they went up another eighth after I bought them. They were
going up. I’m bowled over by all this. Par! It’s unbelievable.”</p>
<p>“Well, golly, Sherman,” said Parch, who was no longer smiling, “can’t
you see what was happening? Somebody at Salomon was painting you a
picture. They were loaded with U Frags, and they knew the SandandandandP
report was on the way, and so they painted a picture. They lowered the
price two days ago, looking for nibbles. Then they brought it back up to
make it look like there was some trading going on. Then they lowered it
again yesterday and they pulled it up. Then when they got your
nibble—quite a nice little nibble—they raised the price again, to see if
you’d nibble again at 102 1/8. You and Solly were the whole market,
Sherman! Nobody else was touching it. They painted you a picture. Now
Oscar’s out 0,000 and he’s got three million triple B’s he doesn’t
want.”</p>
<p>A terrible clear light. Of course it was true. He had let himself be
suckered in the most amateurish fashion. And Oscar Suder, of all people!
Oscar, whom he was counting on as part of the Giscard package…only 0
million out of 00 million, but that was 0 million he’d have to find
somewhere else…</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to say,” said Sherman. “You’re absolutely right. I
goofed.” He realized goofed sounded as if he were letting himself off
easy. “It was a stupid blunder, Arnold. I should’ve seen it coming.” He
shook his head. “Boy. Oscar, of all people. I wonder if I should call
him myself?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t just yet. He’s really pissed off. He wanted to know if
you or anybody else here knew the SandandandandP report was coming. I
said no, because I knew you wouldn’t pull anything on Oscar. But in fact
Research did know about it. You should’ve checked with ’em, Sherman.
After all, three million bonds…”</p>
<p>Parch smiled the smile of no-hard-feelings. He obviously didn’t like
sessions like this himself. “It’s okay. It happens; it happens. But
you’re our number one man out there, Sherman.” He lifted his eyebrows
and kept them way up on his forehead, as if to say, “You get the
picture?”</p>
<p>He hauled himself up from out of his chair. Likewise, Sherman. With
considerable embarrassment Parch extended his hand, and Sherman shook
it.</p>
<p>“Okay, go get ’em,” Parch said with a large but flat smile.</p>
<p>The distance from where Kramer stood at the prosecution table to
where Herbert 92X sat at the defense table was no more than twenty feet
to begin with. Kramer took a couple of steps closer, narrowing the gap
until everybody in the courtroom could tell that something odd was
taking place without being able to tell exactly what. He had reached the
part where it was time to demolish whatever pity for Herbert that
Teskowitz might have managed to create.</p>
<p>“Now, I know we’ve heard certain things about the personal history of
Herbert 92X,” said Kramer, facing the jury, “and here Herbert 92X sits
today, in this courtroom.” Unlike Teskowitz, Kramer threw the name
Herbert 92X into almost every sentence, until he began to sound like a
sci-fi movie robot. Then he pivoted and lowered his head and stared
Herbert in the face and said, “Yes, here is Herbert 92X…in perfect
health!…full of energy!…ready to return to the streets and resume his
life, in the Herbert 92X style which involves carrying a concealed
unlicensed illegal .38-caliber revolver!”</p>
<p>Kramer looked Herbert 92X in the eye. He was now barely ten feet away
from him, and he hurled health, energy, and resume in his teeth, as if
he personally was ready to remove the man’s health, energy, and
potential for the resumption of a workaday life or life of any sort, for
that matter, with his bare hands. Herbert was not one to shrink from a
challenge. He contemplated Kramer with a cool smile on his face that as
much as said, “Just keep on talking, sucker, because I’m going to count
to ten and then…squash you.” To the jurors—to her—Herbert must have
looked as if he was close enough to reach out and throttle him and, on
top of that, eager to throttle him. That didn’t worry Kramer. He was
backed up by three court officers who were already in high spirits from
the thought of the overtime pay they would be getting for the evening’s
work. So let Herbert sit there in his Arab outfit and look as tough as
he wants! The tougher Herbert looked in the eyes of the jury, the better
it was for Kramer’s case. And the more dangerous he looked in the eyes
of Miss Shelly Thomas—the more heroic the aura of the fearless young
prosecutor!</p>
<p>The truly incredulous person was Teskowitz. His head was going back
and forth slowly, like a lawn sprinkler. He couldn’t believe the
performance he was witnessing. If Kramer was going after Herbert this
way in this piece a shit, what the hell would he do if he had a real
killer on his hands?</p>
<p>“Well, ladies and gentlemen,” said Kramer, turning back toward the
jury but remaining just as close to Herbert, “it is my duty to speak for
someone who is not sitting before us in this courtroom, because he was
struck down and killed by a bullet from a revolver in the possession of
a man he had never seen before in his life, Herbert 92X. I would remind
you that the issue in this trial is not the life of Herbert 92X but the
death of Nestor Cabrillo, a good man, a good citizen of the Bronx, a
good husband, a good father…of five children…cut down in the prime of
his life because of Herbert 92X’s arrogant belief…that he is entitled to
conduct his business with a concealed, unlicensed, illegal .38-caliber
revolver in his possession…”</p>
<p>Kramer let his eyes grace each juror, one by one. But at the end of
each orotund period they came to rest upon her. She was sitting next to
the end on the left side in the second row, and so it was a little
awkward, perhaps even a little obvious. But life is short! And, my
God!—such a flawless white face!—such a luxurious corona of hair!—such
perfect lips with brown lipstick! And such an admiring gleam did he now
detect in those big brown eyes! Miss Shelly Thomas was roaring drunk,
high on crime in the Bronx.</p>
<p>Out on the sidewalk, Peter Fallow could see the cars and taxis
speeding uptown on West Street. Christ God, how he longed to be able to
crawl into a taxi and go to sleep until he reached Leicester’s. No! What
was he thinking? No Leicester’s tonight; not a drop of alcohol in any
form. Tonight he was going straight home. It was getting dark. He’d give
anything for a taxi…to curl up in a taxi and go to sleep and head
straight home…But the ride would be nine or ten dollars, and he had less
than seventy-five dollars to last him until payday, which was next week,
and in New York seventy-five dollars was nothing, a mere sigh, a deep
breath, a passing thought, a whim, a snap of the fingers. He kept
looking at the front entrance to the City Light building, which was a
dingy Moderne tower from the 1920s, hoping to spot some American from
the newspaper with whom he could share a taxi. The trick was to find out
where the American was heading and then to pick out some destination
four or five blocks short of there and announce that as one’s own
destination. No American had the nerve to ask one to share the cost of
the ride under those circumstances.</p>
<p>After a bit there emerged an American named Ken Goodrich, the City
Light’s director of marketing, whatever in God’s name marketing was. Did
he dare once more? He had already hitched rides with Goodrich twice in
the past two months, and the second time Goodrich’s delight over the
opportunity to converse with an Englishman on the ride uptown had been
considerably less intense; considerably. No, he did not dare. So he
girded his loins for the eight-block walk to City Hall, where he could
catch the Lexington Avenue subway.</p>
<p>This old part of lower Manhattan emptied out quickly in the evenings,
and as Fallow trudged along in the gloaming he felt increasingly sorry
for himself. He searched his jacket pocket to see if he had a subway
token. He did, and this provoked a depressing recollection. Two nights
ago at Leicester’s he had reached into his pocket to give Tony Moss a
quarter for a telephone call—he wanted to be big about the quarter,
because he was beginning to get a reputation as a cadger even among his
fellow countrymen—and he produced a handful of change, and right there,
among the dimes, quarters, nickels, and pence, were two subway tokens.
He felt as if the entire table was staring at them. Certainly Tony Moss
saw them.</p>
<p>Fallow had no physical fear of riding the New York subways. He
fancied himself a rugged fellow, and in any case, nothing untoward had
ever befallen him in the Underground. No, what he feared—and it amounted
to a true fear—was the squalor. Heading down the stairs of the City Hall
subway station with all these dark shabby people was like descending,
voluntarily, into a dungeon, a very dirty and noisy dungeon. Grimy
concrete and black bars were everywhere, cage after cage, level upon
level, a delirium seen through black bars in every direction. Every time
a train entered or left the station there was an agonized squeal of
metal, as if some huge steel skeleton were being pried apart by a lever
of incomprehensible power. Why was it that in this gross fat country,
with its obscene heaps of wealth and its even more obscene obsession
with creature comforts, they were unable to create an Underground as
quiet, orderly, presentable, and—well—decent as London’s? Because they
were childish. So long as it was underground, out of sight, it didn’t
matter what it was like.</p>
<p>Fallow was able to get a seat at this hour, if a space on a narrow
plastic bench could be called a seat. Before him were spread the usual
grim riot of graffiti, the usual dark shabby people with their gray and
brown clothes and their sneakers—except for a pair just across from him,
a man and a boy. The man, who was probably in his forties, was short and
plump. He was wearing a tasteful and expensive-looking gray chalk-stripe
suit, a crisp white shirt, and, for an American, a discreet necktie. He
also wore a pair of trim, well-made, well-shined black shoes. American
men usually destroyed otherwise presentable ensembles by wearing bulky,
big-soled, badly kept shoes. (They seldom saw their own feet, and so,
being childish, scarcely bothered about what was on them.) Between his
feet was an obviously expensive dark leather attaché case. He was
leaning over to talk into the ear of the boy, who appeared to be eight
or nine years old. The boy wore a navy school blazer, a white
button-down shirt, and a striped necktie. Still talking to the boy, the
man cast his eyes here and there and gestured with his right hand.
Fallow figured that here was a man who worked on Wall Street who had had
his son down to his office for a visit and was now giving him a ride on
the subway and was pointing out the arcana of this rolling dungeon.</p>
<p>Absentmindedly he watched the two of them, as the train picked up
speed and settled into the rocking lurching roaring momentum of the trip
uptown. Fallow could see his own father. A poor little weed, a sad
little fellow, was all he had turned out to be, a poor little weed who
had had a son named Peter, a poor little failure who sat there amid his
bohemian props in a tumble-down house in Canterbury…And what am I,
thought Fallow, sitting in this rolling dungeon in this insane city in
this lunatic country? Longing for a drink, longing for a drink…Another
swell of despair rolled over him…He looked down at his lapels. He could
see them shining even in this miserable light. He had slid…below
bohemian…The dread word popped into his head: seedy.</p>
<p>The subway stop at Lexington Avenue and Seventy-seventh Street was
dangerously close to Leicester’s. But that was no problem. Peter Fallow
was no longer going to play that game. As he reached the top of the
stairs and stepped onto the sidewalk in the twilight, he summoned the
scene up into his mind, merely for the purpose of proving to himself his
resolve and rejecting it. The old wood, the frosted-glass lamps, the
lights from the well behind the bar and the way it lit up the rows of
bottles, the pubby crush of people, the roaring hearth of their
voices—their voices—English voices…Perhaps if he just had an orange
juice and ginger ale and fifteen minutes of English voices…No! He would
be firm.</p>
<p>Now he was in front of Leicester’s, which to the innocent passerby no
doubt looked like just another cozy East Side bistro or trattoria.
Between the old-fashioned mullions of the panes he could see all the
cozy faces clustered at the tables by the windows, cozy happy white
faces lit up by rosy amber lamps. That did it. He needed solace and an
orange juice and ginger ale and English voices.</p>
<p>As one enters Leicester’s, from Lexington Avenue, one finds himself
in a room full of tables with red-checked cloths, in the bistro fashion.
Along one wall runs a big saloon bar with a brass foot rail. Off to one
side is a smaller dining room. In this room, under the window that looks
out on Lexington Avenue, is a table around which eight or ten people can
be crammed, assuming they are convivial. By unspoken custom this has
become the English table, a kind of club table where, in the afternoon
and early evening, the Brits—members of the London bon ton now living in
New York—come and go, to have a few…and hear English voices.</p>
<p>The voices! The hearth was already roaring as Fallow walked in.</p>
<p>“Hello, Peter!”</p>
<p>It was Grillo, the American, standing among the crowd at the bar. He
was an amusing fellow, and friendly, but Fallow had had enough of
America for one day. He smiled and sang out “Hello, Benny!” and headed
straight for the side room.</p>
<p>Tony Moss was at the Table; and Caroline Heftshank; and Alex
Britt-Withers, who owned Leicester’s; and St. John Thomas, the museum
director and (on the QT) art dealer; and St. John’s boyfriend, Billy
Cortez, a Venezuelan who had gone to Oxford and might as well have been
English; and Rachel Lampwick, one of Lord Lampwick’s two remittance
daughters in New York; and Nick Stopping, the Marxist
journalist—Stalinist was more like it—who lived chiefly on articles
flattering the rich in House andandandand Garden, Art andandandand
Antiques, and Connoisseur. Judging by the glasses and bottles, the Table
had been in session for some time, and pretty soon they would be looking
for a fish, unless Alex Britt-Withers, the owner—but no, Alex never
forgave the tab.</p>
<p>Fallow sat down and announced that he was turning over a new leaf and
wanted only an orange juice with ginger ale. Tony Moss wanted to know if
this meant he had stopped drinking or stopped paying. Fallow didn’t mind
that, since it came from Tony, whom he liked, and so he laughed and said
that in fact nobody’s money was any good this evening since their
generous host, Alex, was at the Table. And Alex said, “Least of all
yours, I suspect.” Caroline Heftshank said Alex had hurt Fallow’s
feelings, and Fallow said that was true and that under the circumstances
he was forced to change his mind. He told the waiter to bring him a
“vodka Southside.” Everybody laughed, because this was an allusion to
Asher Herzfeld, an American, heir to the Herzfeld glass fortune, who had
gotten into a furious row with Alex last night because he couldn’t get a
table. Herzfeld had always driven the waiters and the bartenders crazy
by ordering the noxious American drink, the vodka Southside, which was
made with mint, and then complaining that the mint wasn’t fresh. That
got the Table to telling Herzfeld stories. St. John Thomas, in his
flutiest voice, told how he had been to dinner at Herzfeld’s apartment
on Fifth Avenue, and Herzfeld had insisted on introducing the guests to
his staff of four, which embarrassed the servants and annoyed the
guests. He was sure he had heard the young South American houseboy say,
“Well, then, why don’t we all go have dinner at my place,” which
probably would have made for a more amusing evening, in St. John’s
opinion. “Well, would it or wouldn’t it?” asked Billy Cortez, with a
hint of genuine reproach. “I’m sure you’ve taken him up on it since
then. A pimply little Puerto Rican, by the way.” “Not Puerto Rican,”
said St. John, “Peruvian. And not pimply.” Now the Table settled in for
the staple topic, which was the domestic manners of the Americans. The
Americans, with their perverted sense of guilt, were forever introducing
guests to servants, especially “people like Herzfeld,” said Rachel
Lampwick. Then they talked about the wives, the American wives, who
exercised tyrannical control over their husbands. Nick Stopping said he
had discovered why American businessmen in New York took such long lunch
hours. It was the only time they could get away from their wives to have
sex. He was going to do a piece called “Sex at Noon” for Vanity Fair.
Sure enough, the waiter brought Fallow a vodka Southside, and, amid much
gaiety and toasting and complaining to Alex about the condition of the
mint, he drank it and ordered another. It was actually very tasty. Alex
left the Table to see how things were going in the big room, and Johnny
Robertson, the art critic, arrived and told a funny story about an
American who insisted on calling the Italian foreign minister and his
wife by their first names at the opening of the Tiepolo show last night,
and Rachel Lampwick told about the American who was introduced to her
father—“This is Lord Lampwick”—and said, “Hiya, Lloyd.” But American
university professors are all terribly hurt if one doesn’t remember to
call them Doctor, said St. John, and Caroline Heftshank wanted to know
why Americans insist on putting return addresses on the face of the
envelope, and Fallow ordered another vodka Southside, and Tony and
Caroline said why didn’t they order another bottle of wine. Fallow said
he didn’t mind the Yanks calling him by his first name, if only they
wouldn’t insist on condensing it to Pete. All the Yanks at The City
Light called him Pete, and they called Nigel Stringfellow Nige, and they
also wore bogus regimental neckties that leaped out in front of their
shirts, so that every time he saw one of these screaming neckties it set
up a stimulus-response bond and he cringed and braced himself for Pete.
Nick Stopping said he had dinner the other night at the home of Stropp,
the investment banker, on Park Avenue, and Stropp’s four-year-old
daughter, by his second wife, came into the dining room pulling a toy
wagon, upon which was a fresh human turd—yes, a turd!—her own, one
hoped, and she circled the table three times, and neither Stropp nor his
wife did a thing but shake their heads and smile. This required no
extended comment, since the Yanks’ treacly indulgence of their children
was well known, and Fallow ordered another vodka Southside and toasted
the absent Asher Herzfeld, and they ordered drinks all around.</p>
<p>Now it began to dawn on Fallow that he had ordered twenty dollars’
worth of drinks, which he was not about to pay for. As if bound together
by Jung’s collective unconscious, Fallow and St. John and Nick and Tony
were aware that the hour of the fish had arrived. But which fish?</p>
<p>It was Tony, finally, who sang out: “Hello, Ed!” With the heartiest
possible grin on his face, he began beckoning a tall figure toward the
Table. He was an American, well dressed, quite handsome really, with
aristocratic features and a face as fair, pink, lineless, and downy as a
peach.</p>
<p>“Ed, I want you to meet Caroline Heftshank. Caroline, this is my good
friend Ed Fiske.”</p>
<p>Howjados all around, as Tony introduced the young American to the
Table. Then Tony announced: “Ed is the Prince of Harlem.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on,” said Mr. Ed Fiske.</p>
<p>“It’s true!” said Tony. “Ed is the only person I know who can walk
the length, the breadth, the width, the highways, the byways, the high
life, the low dives, of Harlem whenever he wants, wherever he wants, any
time, day or night, and be absolutely welcome.”</p>
<p>“Tony, that’s a terrible exaggeration,” said Mr. Ed Fiske, blushing
but also smiling in a way that indicated it wasn’t an outrageous
exaggeration. He sat down and was encouraged to order a drink, which he
did.</p>
<p>“What is going on in Harlem, Ed?”</p>
<p>Blushing some more, Mr. Ed Fiske confessed to having been in Harlem
that very afternoon. Mentioning no names, he told of an encounter with
an individual from whom it was his delicate mission to insist upon the
return of quite a lot of money, three hundred and fifty thousand
dollars. He told the story haltingly and a bit incoherently, since he
was careful not to stress the factor of color or to explain why so much
money was involved—but the Brits hung on every word with rapt and
beaming faces, as if he were the most brilliant raconteur they had come
across in the New World. They chuckled, they laughed, they repeated the
tag ends of his sentences, like a Gilbert and Sullivan chorus. Mr. Ed
Fiske kept talking, gaining steadily in confidence and fluency. The
drink had hit the spot. He unfurled his fanciest and choicest Harlem
lore. What admiring British faces all around him! How they beamed! They
did indeed appreciate the art of conversation! With casual largesse he
ordered a round of drinks for the Table, and Fallow had another vodka
Southside, and Mr. Ed Fiske told about a tall menacing man nicknamed
Buck who wore a large gold earring, like a pirate.</p>
<p>The Brits had their drinks, and then one by one they slipped away,
first Tony, then Caroline, then Rachel, then Johnny Robertson, then Nick
Stopping. When Fallow said, softly, “Excuse me a moment,” and got up,
only St. John Thomas and Billy Cortez were left, and Billy was tugging
on St. John’s sleeve, because he now detected more than a little
sincerity in the rapt look St. John was beaming toward this beautiful
and apparently rich boy with the peach complexion.</p>
<p>Outside, on Lexington Avenue, Fallow wondered about the size of the
bill that would be handed shortly to young Mr. Fiske. He grinned in the
darkness, being blissfully high. It was bound to be close to two hundred
dollars. He would no doubt pay it without a murmur, the poor fish.</p>
<p>The Yanks. Dear God.</p>
<p>Only the problem of dinner remained to be solved. Dinner at
Leicester’s, even without wine, was at least forty dollars per person.
Fallow headed for the coin telephone on the corner. There was this Bob
Bowles, the American magazine editor…It should work out…The skinny woman
he lived with, Mona something, was very nearly unbearable, even when she
wasn’t talking. But everything in life had its price, didn’t it?</p>
<p>He entered the booth and dropped a quarter in the slot. With luck he
would be back inside of Leicester’s within the hour, eating his favorite
dish, the chicken paillard, which tasted especially good with red wine.
He liked Vieux Galouches, a French wine that came in a bottle with an
eccentric neck, the best.</p>
