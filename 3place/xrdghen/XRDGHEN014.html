<h4 id="i-dont-know-how-to-lie">14. I Don’t Know How to Lie</h4>
<p>Sherman woke up from a dream he couldn’t remember, with his heart
flailing away at his chest wall. It was the drinker’s hour, that hour in
the dead of the night when drinkers and insomniacs suddenly wake up and
know it’s all over, this sleep dodge. He resisted the urge to look at
the illuminated clock on the radio on the table beside the bed. He
didn’t want to know how many hours he would have to lie here fighting
with this stranger, his heart, which was desperate to escape to some far
far far far far far far far far far Canada.</p>
<p>The windows were open on Park and on the side street. Between the
sills and the bottom of the shades was a band of purplish gloom. He
heard an automobile, a lone automobile, starting off from a stoplight.
Then he heard an airplane. It was not a jet but an airplane with a
propeller. The motor stopped. It was going to crash! Then he heard it
again, droning and groaning over New York City. How very odd…</p>
<p>…in the dead of the night. His wife slept, fifteen inches away, on
the other side of the Berlin Wall, breathing regularly…oblivious…She was
turned away from him, on her side, her knees bent. How nice it would be
to roll toward her and tuck his knees in behind hers and press his chest
upon her back. Once they were able…once, when they were so close…they
could do that without waking each other up…in the dead of the night.</p>
<p>This couldn’t be true! There was no way they could break through
these walls to invade his life! The tall skinny boy, the newspapers,
police…at the drinker’s hour.</p>
<p>His dear sweet daughter slept down the hall. Dear Campbell. A happy
little girl—oblivious! A mist came to his wide-open eyes.</p>
<p>He stared at the ceiling and tried to trick himself into falling back
asleep. He thought of…other things…That girl he met in the dining room
of the hotel in Cleveland that time…the businesslike way she undressed
in front of him…as contrasted with Maria…who did this and that, gorged
red with…Lust!…Lust had led him into it…the bowels of the Bronx, the
tall skinny boy…Down he goes—</p>
<p>There were no other things. Everything was tied to these things, and
he lay there with them flaring up in his mind in ghastly pictures…The
ghastly faces on the television screen, Arnold Parch’s dreary face, with
its ghastly attempt at sternness…the evasive voice of Bernard Levy…the
look on Muriel’s face, as if she knew he now bore some terrible taint
and was no longer an Olympian at Pierce andandandand Pierce…Hemorrhaging
money…Surely these were dreams! His eyes were wide open, staring at the
purplish gloom where the Roman shades fell just short of the
win-dowsill…in the dead of the night, dreading the light of the
dawn.</p>
<p>He got up early, walked Campbell to the bus stop, bought the
newspapers on Lexington Avenue, and took a taxi down to Pierce
andandandand Pierce. In the Times…nothing. In the Post…nothing. In the
Daily News, only a picture and a caption. The picture showed pickets and
a crowd. A sign in the foreground said WEISS JUSTICE IS WHITE JUSTICE.
In another two hours…The City Light would be on the stands.</p>
<p>It was a quiet day at Pierce andandandand Pierce, at least for him.
He made his routine calls, to Prudential, Morgan Guaranty, Allen
andandandand Company…The City Light…Felix was over on the other side of
the room. Even to attempt to use him again would be too demeaning…Not a
word from Arnold Parch or anyone else. Freezing me out?…The City
Light…He would call Freddy and have him get the newspaper. Freddy could
read it to him. So he called Freddy, but he had left the office for an
appointment. He called Maria; nowhere to be found…The City Light…He
couldn’t stand it any longer. He would go downstairs and buy the
newspaper and read it in the lobby and return. Yesterday he was AWOL
when a bond issue came in. He blew millions—millions!—in the gold-backed
bonds. How much worse could one more transgression make it? As coolly as
he could, he began walking across the bond trading room toward the
elevators. No one seemed to notice. (No one any longer cares!)</p>
<p>Downstairs, at the newsstand in the lobby, he looked left and right
and then bought The City Light. He walked over behind a big pink marble
column. His heart was pounding away. How grim! how odd!—to live in
personal fear, every day, of the newspapers in New York! Nothing on the
front page…or page 2 or page 3…It was on page 5, a picture and a story
by this person, Peter Fallow. The picture showed the thin black woman
crying, while the tall black man in the suit comforted her. Bacon. There
were picket signs in the background. The story was not long. He raced
through it…“fury of the community”…“luxury car”…“white driver”…No clear
indication what the police were doing. At the end of the article was a
box that said “Editorial, page 36.” His heart started racing again. His
fingers shook as he rustled forward toward page 36…There, at the top of
the editorial column, the heading HIT-OR-MISS JUSTICE.</p>
<p>On Monday The City Light’s Peter Fallow broke the tragic story of
Henry Lamb, the Bronx honor student who was critically injured in a
hit-and-run accident—and abandoned like just another piece of debris in
a littered city.</p>
<p>True, from a legal standpoint Henry Lamb’s is not a tidy case. But
neither has he enjoyed a tidy life. He managed to survive the worst that
growing up in a city housing project could throw his way—including the
murder of his father by a mugger—and achieved an outstanding record at
Ruppert High School. He was struck down on the threshold of a brilliant
future.</p>
<p>Our pity is not enough for Henry Lamb and the many other good people
who are determined to beat the odds in the less affluent sections of our
city. They need to know that their hopes and dreams are important to the
future of all New York. We call for an aggressive investigation of every
angle of the Lamb case.</p>
<p>He was rocked. The thing was becoming a crusade. He stared at the
newspaper. Should he save it? No; better not to be seen with it. He
looked for a trash receptacle or a bench. Nothing. He closed the
newspaper up and folded it in two and let it fall on the floor behind
the column and hurried back to the elevators.</p>
<p>He had lunch at his desk, a sandwich and orange juice, in the
interest of appearing diligent. He was jittery and dreadfully tired. He
couldn’t finish the sandwich. By early in the afternoon he had an
overwhelming desire to close his eyes. His head felt so heavy…The
beginning of a headache had a tight grip on his forehead. He wondered if
he was getting the flu. He ought to call Freddy Button. But he was so
tired. Just then a call came in. It was Freddy calling him.</p>
<p>“It’s funny, I was just thinking of calling you. There was this
goddamned editorial today, Freddy.”</p>
<p>“I know. I read it.”</p>
<p>“You read it?”</p>
<p>“I read all four papers. Listen, Sherman, I’ve taken the liberty of
calling Tommy Killian. Why don’t you go see him? He’s on Reade Street.
It’s not far from where you are, near City Hall. Give him a ring.” In
his occluded smoker’s voice he recited a telephone number.</p>
<p>“I guess it doesn’t look so great,” said Sherman.</p>
<p>“It’s not that. There’s nothing in what I read that’s of any material
significance. It’s just that it’s taking on more of a political
complexion, and Tommy will have a good fix on that.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Thanks, Freddy. I’ll call him.”</p>
<p>Some Irishman on Reade Street named Tommy Killian.</p>
<p>He didn’t call him. He had such a headache, he closed his eyes and
massaged his temples with the tips of his fingers. At five o’clock
sharp, the official end of the day, he left. This was not good form. The
end of the trading day was the beginning of the second part of the day
for a Master of the Universe.</p>
<p>The end of the trading day was like the end of a battle. After five
o’clock the Masters of the Universe took care of all the things people
in other businesses spent the entire day doing. They figured out the
“net net,” which is to say, the actual profit and loss for the day’s
work. They reviewed the markets, reviewed strategies, discussed
personnel problems, researched new issues, and did all the reading of
the financial press that was forbidden during the daily battle. They
told war stories and beat their breasts and yodeled, if they deserved
it. The one thing you never did was simply go home to the
wife’n’kiddies.</p>
<p>Sherman had Muriel order a car for him from the car service. He
studied her face for signs of his fall from grace. A blank.</p>
<p>Out in front of the building the street was four and five deep with
car-service cars and white men in business suits threading their way
among them, heads lowered, squinting, looking for their numbers. The
name of the car service and the number of the car were always posted in
a side window. Pierce andandandand Pierce used a company called Tango.
All Oldsmobile and Buick sedans. Pierce andandandand Pierce ordered
three to four hundred rides a day at an average of 5 per. Some clever
devil at Tango, whoever owned it, was probably clearing a million
dollars a year on Pierce andandandand Pierce alone. Sherman was looking
for Tango 278. He wandered amid the sea of sedans, occasionally caroming
off men who looked much like himself, heads lowered, squinting…dark gray
suits… “ ’Scuse me”… “ ’Scuse me”…The new rush hour! In the old movies,
the Wall Street rush hour was all subways…Subways?…down there
with…them?…Insulate!…Today…roaming, roaming…amid the sedans…squinting,
squinting…’Scuse me, ’scuse me…Finally he found Tango 278.</p>
<p>Bonita and Lucille were surprised to see him come walking in the
apartment at 5:30. He didn’t feel well enough to sound pleasant. Judy
and Campbell weren’t home. Judy had taken her over to a birthday party
on the West Side.</p>
<p>Sherman trudged up the great curved staircase. He went into the
bedroom and took off his jacket and his tie. Without taking off his
shoes, he stretched out on the bed. He closed his eyes. He felt
consciousness falling away, falling away. It was unbearably heavy,
consciousness.</p>
<p>Mister McCoy, Mister McCoy.</p>
<p>Bonita was standing over him. He couldn’t figure out why.</p>
<p>“I no want disturb,” she said. “The doorman, he say two men from the
police downstairs.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The doorman, he say—”</p>
<p>“Downstairs?”</p>
<p>“Yes. He say from the police.”</p>
<p>Sherman propped himself up on one elbow. There were his legs,
stretched out on the bed. He couldn’t figure out why. It must be
morning, but he had his shoes on. Bonita was standing over him. He
rubbed his face.</p>
<p>“Well…tell them I’m not here.”</p>
<p>“The doorman, he already say you here.”</p>
<p>“What do they want?”</p>
<p>“Don’t know, Mr. McCoy.”</p>
<p>A soft dim gloaming. Was it dawn? He was in a hypnagogic state. He
felt as if his neural pathways were blocked. No pattern at all. Bonita;
the police. The panic set in even before he could focus on the
reasons.</p>
<p>“What time is it?”</p>
<p>“Six o’clock.”</p>
<p>He looked at his legs again, at his shoes. Must be six o’clock at
night. Came home at 5:30. Fell asleep. Still stretched out…in front of
Bonita. A sense of propriety, as much as anything else, made him swing
his legs off the bed and sit on the edge.</p>
<p>“What I tell him, Mr. McCoy?”</p>
<p>She must mean the doorman. He couldn’t get it straight. They were
downstairs. Two policemen. He was sitting on the edge of his bed, trying
to come to. There were two policemen downstairs with the doorman. What
should he say?</p>
<p>“Tell him…they’ll have to wait a minute, Bonita.”</p>
<p>He stood up and started walking toward the bathroom. So groggy, so
stiff; his head hurt; there was a rushing sound in his ears. The face in
the bathroom mirror had the noble chin but was creased and bleary and
decrepit. His shirt was wrinkled and pulled out of his pants. He
splashed water on his face. A drop of it hung from the tip of his nose.
He dried his face with a hand towel. If only he could think. But it was
all blocked. It was all fog. If he refused to see them, and they knew he
was up here, and they did, then they’d be suspicious, wouldn’t they? But
if he talked to them, and they asked him—what? He tried to imagine…He
couldn’t focus on it. Whatever they ask…he doesn’t know…No! He can’t
take a chance! Mustn’t see them! But what had he told Bonita? “They’ll
have to wait”—as if to say, I will see them, but they’ll have to wait a
minute.</p>
<p>“Bonita!” He went back into the bedroom, but she wasn’t there. He
went out into the hallway. “Bonita!”</p>
<p>“Down here, Mr. McCoy.”</p>
<p>From the hallway balcony he could see her standing at the foot of the
staircase. “You haven’t called down to the doorman yet, have you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I call. I tell him they have to wait.”</p>
<p>Shit. Implied he would see them. Too late to back out. Freddy! He’d
call Freddy! He went back to the bedroom, to the telephone by the bed.
He called Freddy’s office. No answer. He called the main number of
Dunning Sponget and asked for him; after what seemed like an
interminable wait, was told he had gone. Call him at home. What was the
number? In the address book downstairs in the library.</p>
<p>He went running down the staircase—realized Bonita was still in the
entry gallery. Mustn’t look rattled in front of her. Two policemen
downstairs with the doorman. Walked across the marble floor with what
perhaps passed for a calm gait.</p>
<p>He kept the address book on a shelf behind the desk. His fingers were
shaking as he went through the pages. B. The telephone—it wasn’t on the
desk. Someone had left it on the side table next to the wing chair. An
outrage. He hurried around the desk to the chair. Time rolling by. He
dialed Freddy’s number. A maid answered. Buttons out to dinner. Shit.
What now? Time rolling, rolling, rolling. What would the Lion do? The
sort of family in which cooperation with the authorities was automatic.
There could be only one reason not to cooperate: You did have something
to hide. Naturally they would detect that immediately, because you do
not cooperate. If only—</p>
<p>He left the library and went back out into the entry gallery. Bonita
was still standing there. She looked at him very intently—and that was
what did it. Didn’t want to look frightened or indecisive in front of
the servants. Didn’t want to look like someone in trouble.</p>
<p>“All right, Bonita.” He tried to sound like someone who was already
bored and knew he was in for a further waste of time. “What doorman’s on
tonight? Eddie?”</p>
<p>“Eddie.”</p>
<p>“Tell him to send them on up. Have them wait here. I’ll be back down
in a minute.”</p>
<p>He walked very deliberately up the staircase. When he reached the
upstairs hallway, he hurried to the bedroom. What he saw in the mirror
was someone very bleary and rumpled. He thrust his chin upward. That
helped. He would be strong. He wouldn’t lose his head. He would be…he
allowed himself the phrase…a Master of the Universe.</p>
<p>How should he look? Should he put his jacket and tie back on? He had
on a white shirt, the pants of a gray nailhead worsted suit and a pair
of black cap-toed shoes. With the tie and the jacket on, he would look
terribly Wall Street, terribly conservative. They might resent that. He
hurried into the other bedroom, which had become his dressing room, and
took a tweed jacket with a plaid design from the closet and slipped it
on. Time rolling by, rolling by. Much more casual, relaxed; a man in his
own home, completely relaxed. But the soft tweed jacket didn’t go with
the hard-finished pants. Besides…a sport jacket…a sport…a young rip who
takes wild rides in a sports roadster…He took off the tweed jacket and
threw it on the daybed and hurried back to the master bedroom. His
jacket and tie were strewn across a stuffed chair. He put on the tie and
pulled it up into a tight knot. Time rolling by, rolling by. He put on
the jacket and buttoned it. He lifted his chin and squared his
shoulders. Wall Street. He went into the bathroom and brushed his hair
back. He lifted his chin again. Be strong. A Master of the Universe.</p>
<p>He rushed back down the hallway, then slowed down as he neared the
stairs. He descended with a slow tread and tried to remember to keep
himself erect.</p>
<p>They were standing in the middle of the marble floor, two men and
Bonita. How strange it all seemed! The two men stood slightly
spread-legged, and Bonita stood seven or eight feet away, as if they
were her little flock. His heart was beating at a good clip.</p>
<p>The larger of the two looked like a great slab of meat with clothes
on. His suit jacket sat out from his wrestler’s gut like cardboard. He
had a fat swarthy face, a Mediterranean face, to Sherman’s way of
thinking. He had a mustache that didn’t go with his hair. The mustache
curled down each side of his lips, a style that to a Pierce andandandand
Pierce bond salesman immediately said Lower Class. This one stared at
Sherman as he came down the stairs, but the other one, the smaller one,
didn’t. He was wearing a sport jacket and the sort of brown pants a wife
might choose to go with it. He was taking in the entry gallery, like a
tourist…the marble, the yew-wood glove chest, the apricot-silk on the
walls, the Thomas Hope chairs, Judy’s tens of thousands of hemorrhaging
dollars’ worth of perfect little details…The man’s nose was big, and his
chin and jaw were weak. He held his head cocked at an angle. He looked
as if some terrific force had hit him on one side of his head. Then he
turned his cockeyed stare toward Sherman. Sherman was aware of his
heartbeat and the sound his shoes made as he walked across the marble.
He kept his chin up and made himself smile amiably.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, how can I help you?” He looked at the big one when he
said it, but it was the little one, the cockeyed one, who answered.</p>
<p>“Mr. McCoy? I’m Detective Martin, and this is Detective
Goldberg.”</p>
<p>Should he shake hands? Might as well. He held out his hand, and the
small one shook it and then the large one. It seemed to embarrass them.
They didn’t shake hands very forcefully.</p>
<p>“We’re investigating an automobile accident involving a personal
injury. Maybe you’ve read about it or seen something about it on
television.” He reached inside his jacket and pulled out a piece of
paper, folded once down the middle. He handed it to Sherman. On it was a
newspaper clipping, the original story from The City Light. The picture
of the tall skinny boy. Parts of the story were underlined in a yellow
marker. Bruckner Boulevard. Mercedes-Benz. R. Would his fingers tremble!
If he held the paper long enough to read the entire story, they would.
He looked up at the two detectives.</p>
<p>“We saw something about this on television last night, my wife and
I.” Should he say he was surprised? Or what a coincidence? It dawned on
him, in just these words: I don’t know how to lie. “We thought, Good
Lord, we have a Mercedes, and the license number starts with R.” He
glanced back down at the clipping and quickly returned it to the small
one, Martin.</p>
<p>“You and a lotta people,” said Martin with a reassuring smile. “We’re
trying to check ’em all out.”</p>
<p>“How many are there?”</p>
<p>“A lot. We got a lotta officers working on this. My partner and me
got a list here with about twenty on it ourselves.”</p>
<p>Bonita was still standing there, looking on, taking it all in.</p>
<p>“Well, come on in here,” Sherman said to the one called Martin. He
motioned toward the library. “Bonita, do me a favor. If Mrs. McCoy and
Campbell come back, tell them I’ll be busy with these gentlemen, in the
library.”</p>
<p>Bonita nodded and retreated toward the kitchen.</p>
<p>In the library, Sherman went around behind the desk and gestured
toward the wing chair and the Sheraton armchair. The little one, Martin,
looked all around. Sherman became acutely aware of how much obviously
expensive…stuff…was crammed into this one small room…the fabulous
clutter…the knickknacks…and when the little detective’s eyes reached the
carved frieze, they remained pinned there. He turned toward Sherman with
an open, boyish look on his face, as if to say, Not bad! Then he sat
down in the armchair, and the big one, Goldberg, sat down in the wing
chair. Sherman sat down behind the desk.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s see,” said Martin. “Can you tell us if your car was in
use the night this happened?”</p>
<p>“When exactly was it?” Well—now I’m committed to lying.</p>
<p>“Tuesday a week ago,” said Martin.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Sherman, “I’d have to try to figure.”</p>
<p>“How many people use your car?”</p>
<p>“Me mostly, sometimes my wife.”</p>
<p>“You have any children?”</p>
<p>“I have a daughter, but she’s only six.”</p>
<p>“Anybody else have access to the car?”</p>
<p>“No, I guess not, except for the people at the garage.”</p>
<p>“The garage?” asked Martin. “A parking garage?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Why had he mentioned the garage?</p>
<p>“You leave the car there, with the keys, and they park it?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Where is it, the garage?”</p>
<p>“It’s…near here.” Sherman’s mind began spinning at a furious rate.
They suspect the attendants! No, that’s crazy. Dan! He could see the
chubby little redheaded troll. He’ll be happy to tell them I took the
car out that night! Perhaps he wouldn’t remember or wouldn’t know what
night it was. Oh, he’ll know! The way I froze him out—</p>
<p>“Could we go there and take a look at it?”</p>
<p>Sherman’s mouth had gone dry. He could feel his lips contracting.</p>
<p>“The car?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“Soon’s we leave here’s good a time as any, for us.”</p>
<p>“You mean now? Well, I don’t know…” Sherman felt as if the muscles of
his lips were being constricted by a purse string.</p>
<p>“There’s certain things that’s consistent with an incident like this.
If a car don’t have those things, then we keep on going down the list.
At this point we’re looking for a car. We don’t have a description of a
driver. So—that okay with you?”</p>
<p>“Well…I don’t know…” No! Let them look at it! There’s nothing for
them to find! Or is there? Something I don’t know about, never heard of!
But if I say no—they’ll be suspicious! Say yes! But suppose the little
redheaded attendant is on!</p>
<p>“It’s the routine. We look at all the cars.”</p>
<p>“I know, but, uh, if this, uh, is a routine, then I guess I ought
to…follow the routine that I—that’s appropriate to me, to someone with a
car in this situation.” His mouth kept tightening. He saw the two men
exchange glances.</p>
<p>The small one, Martin, had a look of great disappointment on his
face. “You want to cooperate, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>“Well, this is no big deal. This is part of the routine. We check the
cars.”</p>
<p>“I know, but if there’s a routine—then that’s what I should do, too,
follow a routine. Or that would be the logical thing, it seems to
me.”</p>
<p>Sherman was acutely aware of sputtering nonsense, but he hung on to
this word routine for dear life. If only he could control the muscles
around his mouth—</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I don’t get it,” said Martin. “What routine?”</p>
<p>“Well, you mentioned a routine, your routine, for investigating a
case like this. I don’t know how these things work, but there must be a
routine for the owner of a car in this situation—I mean, I happen to own
a car of a make and a license number—with a license number—and I know
there must be a routine. That’s what I’m trying to say. I think that’s
what I need to consider. The routine.”</p>
<p>Martin stood up and started looking at the carved frieze again. His
eyes followed it halfway around the room. Then he looked at Sherman with
his head at the cockeyed angle. There was a small smile on his lips.
Impudent! Chilling!</p>
<p>“Awright, the routine is—it ain’t nothing complicated. If you wanna
cooperate with us, and you don’t mind cooperating with us, then you
cooperate with us and we look at the car, and we go on our way. Nothing
complicated. Okay? If you don’t wanna cooperate, if you have your
reasons for not cooperating, then you don’t cooperate, and then we have
to go through channels, and the same thing happens anyway, and so it’s
up to you.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s just that…” He didn’t know how he was going to end the
sentence.</p>
<p>“When’s the last time you drove your car, Mr. McCoy?” It was the
other one, the big one, Goldberg, who was still sitting in the wing
chair. For an instant Sherman was grateful for the change of
subject.</p>
<p>“Let me see…Over the weekend, I guess, unless…let me see, have I
driven it since then…”</p>
<p>“How many times you driven it over the past two weeks?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know exactly…Let me see…”</p>
<p>He was looking at the great slab of meat in the wing chair,
desperately trying to figure out how to lie to these questions—and out
of the corner of his eye he could see the smaller one walking toward
him, around the side of the desk.</p>
<p>“How often you usually drive it?” asked Goldberg.</p>
<p>“It varies.”</p>
<p>“How many times a week?”</p>
<p>“As I say, it varies.”</p>
<p>“It varies. You drive it to work?”</p>
<p>Sherman stared at the great slab of meat with the mustache. Something
grossly insolent about this interrogation. Time to cut it off, assert
himself. But what tone to take? These two were connected by an invisible
line to a dangerous…Power…that he did not comprehend. What?—</p>
<p>The small one, Martin, had now come all the way around to his side of
the desk. From way down here in his chair, Sherman looked up at Martin,
and Martin looked down upon him with his cockeyed expression. At first
he looked very sad. Then he smiled a brave smile.</p>
<p>“Look, Mr. McCoy,” he said, smiling through his sadness, “I’m sure
you wanna cooperate, and I don’t wanna see you get hung up on the
routine. It’s just that we gotta go over everything in this case very
carefully, because the victim, this Mr. Lamb, is in very bad shape. The
best information we got is, he’s gonna die. So we’re asking everybody to
cooperate, but there’s nothing says you have to. If you want to, you can
say nothing at all. You have that right. You understand?”</p>
<p>When he said, “You understand?” he cocked his head at an extreme
angle and smiled an incredulous smile that indicated Sherman would have
to be a terrible ingrate, troublemaker, and callous citizen, indeed, if
he did not cooperate.</p>
<p>Then he put both hands on the top of Sherman’s desk and leaned
forward until his arms supported the weight of his upper body. This
brought his face closer to Sherman’s, although he was still looking down
at him.</p>
<p>“I mean, you know,” he said, “you have the right to an attorney.”</p>
<p>The way he said attorney, it was as if he was trying to think of
every crazy and ridiculous choice a man—a smaller and far more devious
man than Sherman McCoy—might have. “You understand, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Sherman found himself nodding yes in spite of himself. A cold tremor
began to spread through his body.</p>
<p>“I mean, for that matter, if you lacked the funds for an attorney”—he
said this with such a comradely smile and such great good humor, it was
as if he and Sherman had been pals for years and had their little
jokes—“and you wanted an attorney, the state would provide you with one
free of charge. If there was any reason you wanted one.”</p>
<p>Sherman nodded again. He stared at the man’s lopsided face. He felt
powerless to act or resist. The man’s message seemed to be: “I don’t
need to tell you these things. You’re a substantial citizen, and you’re
above them. But if you aren’t…then you must be the kind of germ we have
to exterminate.”</p>
<p>“All I’m saying is, we need your cooperation.”</p>
<p>Then he swung about and sat on the edge of the desk and looked
straight down into Sherman’s face. He’s sitting on the edge of my
desk!</p>
<p>He smiled the warmest smile imaginable and asked softly, “Well, what
about it, Mr. McCoy? My partner was asking if you drive your car to
work.” He kept smiling.</p>
<p>The effrontery! The threat! Sitting on my desk! The barbarous
insolence!</p>
<p>“Well, do you?” Smiling his lopsided smile. “You drive it to
work?”</p>
<p>Fear and outrage welled up together. But fear rose higher. “No…I
don’t.”</p>
<p>“Then when do you use it?”</p>
<p>“On the weekends…Or—whenever it’s convenient…during the day or maybe
sometimes at night. I mean not much during the day except when my wife
uses it, which is to say, I mean, it’s hard to say.”</p>
<p>“Could your wife a been using it Tuesday night a week ago?”</p>
<p>“No! I mean, I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“So it might be you use it any time, but you don’t remember.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that. It’s just that—I use the car, I don’t make a note of
it, I don’t keep a record. I don’t think that much about it, I
guess.”</p>
<p>“How often do you use it at night?”</p>
<p>Desperately Sherman tried to calculate the correct answer. If he said
often, did that make it more likely he was out driving that night? But
if he said seldom—then wouldn’t he be more certain about whether he was
driving or not that particular night?</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “Not a lot—but I guess reasonably often,
comparatively.”</p>
<p>“Not a lot but reasonably often comparatively,” said the little
detective in a monotone. By the time he reached comparatively, he was
looking at his partner. He turned back and looked down at Sherman once
more from his perch on the edge of the desk.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s get back to the car. Why don’t we go take a look at it.
Whaddaya say?”</p>
<p>“Now?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t a good time.”</p>
<p>“You got an appointment or something?”</p>
<p>“I’m—waiting for my wife.”</p>
<p>“You going out?”</p>
<p>“I—uhhhhhhhhhhh.” The first-person singular degenerated into a
sigh.</p>
<p>“You going out in the car?” asked Goldberg. “We could take a look at
it. Don’t take a second.”</p>
<p>For an instant Sherman thought of bringing the car from the garage
and letting them look at it in front of the building. But suppose they
didn’t sit still for that? Suppose they came along—and talked to
Dan?</p>
<p>“I hear you say your wife’s coming home soon?” asked the smaller one.
“Maybe we oughta wait and talk to her, too. Maybe she’ll remember if
anybody was using the car Tuesday night a week ago.”</p>
<p>“Well, she—this just isn’t a good time, gentlemen.”</p>
<p>“When is a good time?” asked the smaller one.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. If you can just give me a little time to think about
it.”</p>
<p>“Think about what? When’s a good time? Or if you’re gonna
cooperate?”</p>
<p>“It’s not a question of that. I’m—well, I’m worried about the
procedure.”</p>
<p>“The procedure?”</p>
<p>“Just how this should be handled. Correctly.”</p>
<p>“Is the procedure the same as the routine?” The detective peered down
at him with an insulting little smile.</p>
<p>“Procedure…routine…I’m not familiar with the terminology. I suppose
it does come out the same.”</p>
<p>“I’m not familiar with it, either, Mr. McCoy, because there ain’t no
such terminology, ain’t no such procedure, ain’t no such routine. You
either cooperate in an investigation or you don’t. I thought you wanted
to cooperate?”</p>
<p>“I do, but you’ve narrowed the choices.”</p>
<p>“What choices?”</p>
<p>“Well—look. I guess what I should do is, I should…I should talk this
over with an attorney.”</p>
<p>As soon as the words came out of his mouth, he felt he had made a
terrible admission.</p>
<p>“As I told you,” said the little detective, “that’s your right. But
why would you wanna talk to an attorney? Why would you wanna go to that
trouble and expense?”</p>
<p>“I just want to make sure I proceed”—immediately he was afraid he
would be in trouble for uttering the verb form of
procedure—“correctly.”</p>
<p>The fat one, sitting in the wing chair, spoke up. “Let me ask you
something, Mr. McCoy. Is there anything you’d like to get off your
chest?”</p>
<p>Sherman grew cold. “Get off my chest?”</p>
<p>“Because if there is”—a fatherly smile—insolence!—“now is the time to
do it, before things go any further and get complicated.”</p>
<p>“What would I have to get off my chest?” He meant to sound firm, but
it came out…bewildered.</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m asking you.”</p>
<p>Sherman stood up and shook his head. “I don’t think there’s any use
continuing this right now. I’m gonna have to talk—”</p>
<p>The little one, still sitting on the desk, finished the sentence for
him: “—to a lawyer?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The small one shook his head the way you do when somebody you’re
advising seems determined to stick to a foolish course. “That’s your
privilege. But if you got anything substantial here to talk to a lawyer
about, you’re gonna be better off coming out with it right now. And
you’re gonna feel better. Whatever it is, it probably ain’t as bad as
you think. Everybody makes mistakes.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say there was anything substantial. There isn’t.” He felt
trapped. I’m trying to play their game—when I should be rejecting the
game itself!</p>
<p>“You sure?” asked the fat one with what he obviously thought was a
paternal smile on his face. In fact, it was…horrible…obscene…The
impudence!</p>
<p>Sherman edged past the smaller one, who remained seated on the desk
and followed him with his menacing little eyes. Near the door Sherman
turned around and looked at them both.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he said, “but I don’t see any point in going into this—I
don’t think I should discuss it any further.”</p>
<p>Finally the smaller one stood up—finally removes himself from his
insolent perch on my desk! He shrugged and looked at the fat one, who
also stood up.</p>
<p>“Okay, Mr. McCoy,” said the smaller one, “we’ll see you…with your
lawyer.” The way he said it, it seemed to mean “We’ll see you…in
court.”</p>
<p>Sherman opened the door of the library and motioned for them to head
out into the entry gallery. It seemed terribly important for him to
usher them out and leave the room last—to prove that this was, after
all, his household and that he was master of it.</p>
<p>When they reached the door to the elevator vestibule, the smaller one
said to the fat one, “Davey, you got a card? Give Mr. McCoy a card.”</p>
<p>The fat one took a card from the side pocket of his jacket and handed
it to Sherman. The card was wrinkled.</p>
<p>“You change your mind,” said the smaller one, “you give us a
call.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, think it over,” said the fat one, with his hideous smile.
“Whatever’s on your mind, the sooner you tell us, the better it’s gonna
be for you. That’s the way it is. Right now you’re still in a position
to cooperate. You wait…the machinery starts…” He turned his palms up, as
if to say, “And then you’re in a hell of a mess.”</p>
<p>Sherman opened the door. The smaller one said, “Think it over.”</p>
<p>As they walked out, the fat one gave him a horrible wink.</p>
<p>Sherman closed the door. They were gone. Far from being relieved, he
was swept by an overpowering dismay. His entire central nervous system
told him he had just suffered a catastrophic defeat—and yet he didn’t
know what had happened. He couldn’t analyze his wounds. He had been
outrageously violated—but how had it happened? How had these
two…insolent…Low Rent…animals…invaded his life?</p>
<p>When he turned around, Bonita had emerged from the kitchen and was
standing on the edge of the marble floor. He had to say something to
her. She knew they were the police.</p>
<p>“They’re investigating an automobile accident, Bonita.” Too
flustered.</p>
<p>“Oh, an accident.” Her wide eyes said, “Tell me more.”</p>
<p>“Yes…I don’t know. One of the cars involved had a license plate close
to one of ours. Or something.” He sighed and made a helpless gesture. “I
couldn’t figure it all out.”</p>
<p>“You don’t worry, Mr. McCoy. They know it’s not you.” The way she
said it, he could tell he looked very worried indeed.</p>
<p>Sherman went into the library and closed the door and waited three or
four minutes. He knew it was irrational, but he had the feeling that if
he didn’t wait until the two policemen were out of the building, they
would somehow reappear, pop back in, just like that, smirking and
winking in the horrible way they had. Then he called Freddy Button’s
home and left word that he should call whenever he got in.</p>
<p>Maria. Had to talk to her. Did he dare call her? Didn’t even know
where she would be…the hideaway, the apartment on Fifth…Telephone
tap!…Could they somehow tap his telephone immediately? Had they left a
listening device in the room?…Calm down…That’s crazy…But suppose Judy
has already come back, and I didn’t hear her!</p>
<p>He got up from the chair and walked out into his grand entry
gallery…No one around…He heard a little clink clink…Marshall’s license
tags…The doleful dachshund came waddling out of the living room…The
beast’s toenails clattered on the marble…The little piece of salami that
walks…the cause of half my problems…And what do you care about the
police?…Food and a walk, food and a walk…Then Bonita poked her head in
the doorway…Don’t want to miss anything, hunh? Want to gobble up all the
cop stuff, right?…Sherman stared at her accusingly.</p>
<p>“Oh, I think Mrs. McCoy come home,” she said.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” he said, “when Mrs. McCoy and Campbell come in, you’ll
hear them.” And until then keep your nose out of my affairs.</p>
<p>Picking up the tone of his voice clearly enough, Bonita retreated
into the kitchen. Sherman headed back toward the library. I’ll risk a
call. Just then the door from the elevator vestibule opened.</p>
<p>Judy and Campbell.</p>
<p>Now what? How could he call Maria? Would he have to tell Judy about
the police first? If he didn’t, Bonita would.</p>
<p>Judy looked at him quizzically. What the hell was she wearing? White
flannel pants, a white cashmere sweater, and some sort of black punk
jacket with shoulder pads…out to…here…sleeves pushed up almost to her
elbow, a collar with a ridiculously wide notch way down…here…All the
while Campbell looked supremely ladylike in her burgundy Taliaferro
jumper and blazer and white blouse with a buttercup collar…Why was it
that these days all the little girls were dressed like ladies and their
mothers were dressed like teenage brats?</p>
<p>“Sherman,” said Judy, looking concerned, “is something wrong?”</p>
<p>Should he tell her about the police immediately? No! Get out and call
Maria!</p>
<p>“Uh, no,” he said, “I was just—”</p>
<p>“Daddy!” said Campbell, walking toward him. “See these cards?”</p>
<p>See these cards?</p>
<p>She held up three miniature playing cards toward him, the ace of
hearts, the ace of spades, and the ace of diamonds.</p>
<p>“What are they?” she said.</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>“I don’t know, sweetheart. Playing cards.”</p>
<p>“But what are they?”</p>
<p>“Just a minute, sweetie. Judy, I’ve got to go out for a minute.”</p>
<p>“Daddy! What are they!”</p>
<p>“The magician gave them to her,” said Judy. “Tell her what they are.”
A little nod of the head that said, “Humor her. She wants to show you a
trick.”</p>
<p>“When I come back,” he said to Campbell. “I have to go out for just a
second.”</p>
<p>“Daddy!” She hopped up and down, trying to put the cards right in his
face.</p>
<p>“One second, sweetheart!”</p>
<p>“You’re going out?” said Judy. “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“I have to go over to—”</p>
<p>“DADDY! TELL—ME—WHAT—THEY—ARE!”</p>
<p>“—Freddy Button’s.”</p>
<p>“DADDY!”</p>
<p>“Shhhhhhhhhh,” said Judy. “Hush up.”</p>
<p>“Daddy…look!” The three cards were dancing in the air in front of his
face.</p>
<p>“Freddy Button’s? Do you know what time it is? We have to get ready
to go out!”</p>
<p>“Tell me what they are, Daddy!”</p>
<p>Christ! He’d totally forgotten! They were supposed to go to dinner at
these dreadful people’s, the Bavardages’! Judy’s bunch…the social
X-rays…Tonight? Impossible!</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Judy. I…don’t know how long I’ll have to be at
Freddy’s. I’m sorry, I—”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, you don’t know?”</p>
<p>“DADDY!” Close to tears, in her frustration.</p>
<p>“For God’s sake, Sherman, look at the cards.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say ‘God,’ Mommy.”</p>
<p>“You’re absolutely right, Campbell. I shouldn’t have said that.”</p>
<p>He leaned over and peered at the cards. “Well…the ace of hearts…the
ace of spades…and the ace of diamonds.”</p>
<p>“You’re sure?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Big smile. Triumphant. “I just wave them like this.” She began
fanning the cards about at a furious rate, until they were a blur in the
air.</p>
<p>“Sherman, you don’t have time to go to Freddy Button’s.” A stern
and-that’s-that look.</p>
<p>“Judy, I have to.” Rolling his eyes toward the library, as if to say,
“I’ll explain it to you in there.”</p>
<p>“Bibbidy, bobbidy, boo!” said Campbell. “Now look, Daddy!”</p>
<p>Judy, in a voice under tight rein: “We’re going…to—that—dinner.”</p>
<p>He leaned over again. “The ace of diamonds…the ace of hearts…the ace
of…clubs! Whuh—Campbell! How did the ace of clubs get there?”</p>
<p>Delighted. “It just—did!”</p>
<p>“Why—it’s magic!”</p>
<p>“Sherman—”</p>
<p>“How did you do that? I can’t believe it!”</p>
<p>“Sherman, did you hear me?”</p>
<p>Campbell, with great modesty: “The magician showed me.”</p>
<p>“Ah! The magician. What magician?”</p>
<p>“At MacKenzie’s birthday party.”</p>
<p>“That’s amazing!”</p>
<p>“Sherman, look at me.”</p>
<p>He looked at her.</p>
<p>“Daddy! You want to see how I did it?”</p>
<p>“Sherman.” More and-that’s-that.</p>
<p>“Look, Daddy, I’ll show you.”</p>
<p>Judy, with frantic sweetness: “Campbell, you know who just loves
magic tricks?”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“Bonita. She’s crazy about them. Why don’t you go show her before
she’s busy fixing your dinner. Then you can come back and show Daddy how
you did it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, all right.” She trudged off to the kitchen disconsolately.
Sherman felt guilty.</p>
<p>“Come on in the library,” he said to Judy in a portentous voice.</p>
<p>They went into the library, and he shut the door and told Judy to sit
down. This will be too much for you to take standing up. She sat down in
the wing chair, and he sat in the armchair.</p>
<p>“Judy, you remember that thing on television last night, about the
hit-and-run accident in the Bronx, and they’re looking for a Mercedes
with a license plate that begins with R?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well, two policemen came by here, just before you and Campbell came
home. Two detectives, and they asked me a lot of questions.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>He described the interrogation, wanting it to sound menacing—I must
go see Freddy Button!—but avoiding his own feelings of inadequacy and
fear and guilt.</p>
<p>“So I called Freddy, but he wasn’t in, although they’re expecting
him. So I’m going over to his apartment and leave him this note”—he
pressed the breast of his jacket, as if there were a letter in the
inside pocket—“and if he’s back when I get there, I’ll talk to him. So
I’d better go.”</p>
<p>Judy just looked at him for a moment. “Sherman, that makes no sense
whatsoever.” She spoke almost warmly, with a little smile, the way you
talk to someone who needs to be coaxed back from the edge of the roof.
“They’re not going to put you in jail because you have half a license
number. I saw something in the Times about it this morning. Apparently
there are 2,500 Mercedeses with license plates that begin with R. I was
joking with Kate di Ducci at lunch. We had lunch at La Boue d’Argent.
What on earth are you worried about? You certainly weren’t out driving
that night in the Bronx, whenever it was.”</p>
<p>Now!…Tell her!…Get rid of this horrible weight once and for all! Come
clean! With something approaching elation he scaled the last few feet of
the great wall of deceit he had erected between himself and his family,
and—</p>
<p>“Well…I know I wasn’t. But they acted as if they didn’t believe
me.”</p>
<p>—and immediately fell back.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’re imagining things, Sherman. That’s probably just the
way they are. For goodness’ sake. If you want to talk to Freddy, you’ll
have plenty of time to talk to him in the morning.”</p>
<p>“No! Really! I’ve got to go over there.”</p>
<p>“And have a long talk, if necessary.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, if necessary.”</p>
<p>She smiled in a way he didn’t like. Then she shook her head. She was
still smiling. “Sherman, we accepted this invitation five weeks ago.
We’re due there in an hour and a half. And I’m going. And you’re going.
If you want to leave the Bavardages’ number for Freddy to call you,
that’s fine. I’m sure Inez and Leon won’t mind. But we’re going.”</p>
<p>She continued to smile warmly…at the jumper on the roof…and that’s
that.</p>
<p>The calmness…the smile…the would-be warmth…Her face got the point
across more firmly than any explanation she could have ever come up
with. Words might have given him openings to wriggle through. This look
offered no openings at all. Dinner at Inez and Leon Bavardages’ was as
important to Judy as the Giscard had been to him. The Bavardages were
this year’s host and hostess of the century, the most busily and noisily
arrived of the arrivistes. Leon Bavardage was a New Orleans chicory
salesman who had gone on to make a fortune in real estate. His wife,
Inez, perhaps really was a member of an old Louisiana family, the
Belairs. To Sherman (the Knickerbocker) they were ridiculous.</p>
<p>Judy smiled—and she had never been more serious in her life.</p>
<p>But he had to talk to Maria!</p>
<p>He jumped up. “All right, we’re going—but I’ve got to run over to
Freddy’s! I won’t be long!”</p>
<p>“Sherman!”</p>
<p>“I promise you! I’ll be right back!”</p>
<p>He all but ran across the dark green marble of the entry gallery. He
halfway expected her to run after him and yank him back inside from the
elevator vestibule.</p>
<p>Downstairs, Eddie, the doorman, said, “Evening, Mr. McCoy,” and
stared at him with a look that seemed to say, “And why did the cops come
to see you?”</p>
<p>“Hello, Eddie,” he said without pausing to look at him. He began
walking up Park Avenue.</p>
<p>Once he reached the corner, he rushed to the fateful telephone
booth.</p>
<p>Carefully, carefully, he dialed Maria’s number. First at the
hideaway. No answer. Then he called the apartment on Fifth. A Spanish
voice said Mrs. Ruskin couldn’t come to the telephone. Damn! Should he
say it’s urgent? Should he leave his name? But the old man, her husband,
Arthur, might very well be there. He said he would call back.</p>
<p>Had to kill some time to make it plausible that he went to Freddy
Button’s building and dropped off a note and came back. He walked over
to Madison Avenue…the Whitney Museum…the Carlyle Hotel…Three men came
out of the door that led to the Café Carlyle. They were about his age.
They were talking and laughing, with their heads thrown back, blissfully
boiled…All three carried attaché cases, and two of them wore dark suits,
white shirts, and pale yellow ties with small print patterns. These pale
yellow ties had become the insignia of the worker bees of the business
world…What the hell did they have to laugh and crow about, other than
the alcoholic buzz in their brains, the poor deluded—</p>
<p>He was experiencing the resentment of those who discover that,
despite their own grave condition, the world goes on about its business,
heartless, without even so much as a long face.</p>
<p>When he returned to the apartment, Judy was upstairs in their bedroom
suite.</p>
<p>“Well—see? Didn’t take so long,” he said. He sounded as if he
expected a star, for keeping his word.</p>
<p>Several possible comments had time to run through her head. What she
in fact said, finally, was: “We have less than an hour, Sherman. Now, do
me a favor. Please wear the navy suit you got last year, the deep navy.
Midnight blue, I think it is. And a solid tie, not one of those prints.
That navy crepe de chine. Or a shepherd’s check is all right. You always
look nice in those.”</p>
<p>A shepherd’s check is all right…He was overcome by despair and guilt.
They were out there, circling, and he hadn’t had the courage to tell
her. She thought she could still afford the incalculable luxury of
worrying about the correct necktie.</p>
