<h4 id="from-the-fiftieth-floor">3. From the Fiftieth Floor</h4>
<p>Sherman McCoy walked out of his apartment building holding his
daughter Campbell’s hand. Misty days like this created a peculiar
ashy-blue light on Park Avenue. But once they stepped out from under the
awning over the entrance…such radiance! The median strip on Park was a
swath of yellow tulips. There were thousands of them, thanks to the dues
apartment owners like Sherman paid to the Park Avenue Association and
the thousands of dollars the association paid to a gardening service
called Wiltshire Country Gardens, run by three Koreans from Maspeth,
Long Island. There was something heavenly about the yellow glow of all
the tulips. That was appropriate. So long as Sherman held his daughter’s
hand in his and walked her to her bus stop, he felt himself a part of
God’s grace. A sublime state, it was, and it didn’t cost much. The bus
stop was only across the street. There was scarcely a chance for his
impatience over Campbell’s tiny step to spoil this refreshing nip of
fatherhood he took each morning.</p>
<p>Campbell was in the first grade at Taliaferro, which, as everybody,
tout le monde, knew, was pronounced Toliver. Each morning the Taliaferro
school dispatched its own bus, bus driver, and children’s chaper-one up
Park Avenue. Few, indeed, were the girls at Taliaferro who did not live
within walking distance of that bus route.</p>
<p>To Sherman, as he headed out onto the sidewalk holding Campbell’s
hand, she was a vision. She was a vision anew each morning. Her hair was
a luxuriance of soft waves like her mother’s, but lighter and more
golden. Her little face—perfection! Not even the gawky years of
adolescence would alter it. He was sure of that. In her burgundy school
jumper, her white blouse with its buttercup collar, her little nylon
backpack, her white knee-high socks, she was an angel. Sherman found the
very sight touching beyond belief.</p>
<p>The morning-shift doorman was an old Irishman named Tony. After
opening the door for them, he stepped outside under the awning and
watched them depart. That was fine…fine! Sherman liked to have his
fatherhood observed. This morning he was a serious individual,
representing Park Avenue and Wall Street. He wore a blue-gray nailhead
worsted suit, custom-tailored in England for ,800, two-button,
single-breasted, with ordinary notched lapels. On Wall Street
double-breasted suits and peaked lapels were considered a bit sharp, a
bit too Garment District. His thick brown hair was combed straight back.
He squared his shoulders and carried his long nose and wonderful chin up
high.</p>
<p>“Sweetheart, let me button your sweater. It’s a little chilly.”</p>
<p>“No way, José,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“Come on, sweetie, I don’t want you to catch cold.”</p>
<p>“N O, Séjo, N O.” She jerked her shoulders away from him. Séjo was
José backward. “N-n-n-n Ohhhhh.” So Sherman sighed and abandoned his
plan to save his daughter from the elements. They walked on a bit.</p>
<p>“Daddy?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sweetheart?”</p>
<p>“Daddy, what if there isn’t any God?”</p>
<p>Sherman was startled, bowled over. Campbell was looking up at him
with a perfectly ordinary expression, as if she had just asked what
those yellow flowers were called.</p>
<p>“Who said there isn’t any God?”</p>
<p>“But what if there isn’t?”</p>
<p>“What makes you think—did somebody tell you there wasn’t any
God?”</p>
<p>What insidious little troublemaker in her class had been spreading
this poison? So far as Sherman knew, Campbell still believed in Santa
Claus, and here she was, beginning to question the existence of God! And
yet…it was a precocious question for a six-year-old, wasn’t it? No two
ways about that. To think that such a speculation—</p>
<p>“But what if there isn’t!” She was annoyed. Asking her about the
history of the question was no answer.</p>
<p>“But there is a God, sweetie. So I can’t tell you about ‘if there
isn’t.’” Sherman tried never to lie to her. But this time he felt it the
prudent course. He had hoped he would never have to discuss religion
with her. They had begun sending her to Sunday school at St. James’
Episcopal Church, at Madison and Seventy-first. That was the way you
took care of religion. You enrolled them at St. James’, and you avoided
talking or thinking about religion again.</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Campbell. She stared out into the distance. Sherman felt
guilty. She had brought up a difficult question, and he had ducked it.
And here she was, at the age of six, trying to piece together the
greatest puzzle of life.</p>
<p>“Daddy?”</p>
<p>“Yes, darling?” He held his breath.</p>
<p>“You know Mrs. Winston’s bicycle?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Winston’s bicycle? Then he remembered. Two years ago, at
Campbell’s nursery school, there had been a teacher named Mrs. Winston
who braved the traffic and rode a bicycle to school every day. All the
children had thought this was wonderful, a teacher who rode a bicycle to
school. He had never heard Campbell mention the woman since then.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, I remember.” An anxious pause.</p>
<p>“MacKenzie has one just like it.”</p>
<p>MacKenzie? MacKenzie Reed was a little girl in Campbell’s class.</p>
<p>“She does?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Only it’s smaller.”</p>
<p>Sherman waited…for the leap of logic…but it never came. That was it.
God lives! God is dead! Mrs. Winston’s bicycle! No way, José! N O, Séjo!
They all came out of the same heap in the toy box. Sherman was relieved
for a moment, but then he felt cheated. The thought that his daughter
might actually have questioned the existence of God at the age of
six—this he had taken as a sign of superior intelligence. Over the past
ten years, on the Upper East Side, for the first time, intelligence had
become socially correct for girls.</p>
<p>Several little girls in burgundy jumpers, and their parents or
nannies, were assembled at the Taliaferro bus stop, on the other side of
Park Avenue. As soon as Campbell saw them, she tried to remove her hand
from Sherman’s. She had reached that age. But he wouldn’t let her. He
held her hand tightly and led her across the street. He was her
protector. He glowered at a taxi as it came to a noisy stop at the
light. He would gladly throw himself in front of it, if that was what it
would take to save Campbell’s life. As they crossed Park Avenue, he had
a mental picture of what an ideal pair they made. Campbell, the perfect
angel in a private-school uniform; himself, with his noble head, his
Yale chin, his big frame, and his ,800 British suit, the angel’s father,
a man of parts; he visualized the admiring stares, the envious stares,
of the drivers, the pedestrians, of one and all.</p>
<p>As soon as they reached the bus stop, Campbell pulled free. The
parents who brought their girls to the Taliaferro bus stop in the
morning were a cheery bunch. What a chipper mood they were always in!
Sherman began saying his good mornings. Edith Tompkins, John Channing,
MacKenzie Reed’s mother, Kirby Coleman’s nanny, Leonard Schorske,
Mrs. Lueger. When he got to Mrs. Lueger—he had never known her first
name—he did a double take. She was a thin pale blond woman who never
wore makeup. This morning she must have rushed down to the bus stop with
her daughter at the last minute. She was wearing a man’s blue
button-down shirt with the top two buttons unbuttoned. She had on a pair
of old blue jeans and some ballet slippers. The jeans were very tight.
She had a terrific little body. He had never noticed that before. Really
quite terrific! She looked so…pale and half-awake and vulnerable. You
know, what you need is a cup of coffee, Mrs. Lueger. Come on, I’m going
over to that coffee shop on Lexington. Oh, that’s silly, Mr. McCoy. Come
on up to the apartment. I have some coffee already made. He stared at
her for a good two seconds longer than he should have, and then…pop…the
bus arrived, a big solid Greyhound-size vehicle, and the children
bounded up the steps.</p>
<p>Sherman turned away, then looked back at Mrs. Lueger. But she wasn’t
looking at him. She was walking toward her apartment building. The back
seam of her jeans practically clove her in two. There were whitish spots
on either side of the seat. They were like highlights for the flesh that
welled up underneath. What a marvelous bottom she had! And he had always
thought of these women as moms. Who knew what hot little fires burned
within these moms?</p>
<p>Sherman started walking east, toward the taxi stand at First Avenue
and Seventy-ninth Street. He felt buoyant. Just why, he couldn’t have
explained. The discovery of the lovely little Mrs. Lueger…yes, but in
fact he always left the bus stop in a good mood. The Best School, the
Best Girls, the Best Families, the Best Section of the capital of the
Western world in the late twentieth century—but the only part that stuck
in his mind was the sensation of Campbell’s little hand holding his.
That was why he felt so good. The touch of her trusting, utterly
dependent little hand was life itself!</p>
<p>Then his spirits sank. He was walking along at a good clip, his eyes
idly panning the façades of the brownstone houses. On this gray morning
they looked old and depressing. Shapeless polyethylene bags of trash, in
shades of Dogshit Brown and Turd Green, were deposited in front of them,
out by the curbs. The bags had a slimy-looking surface. How could people
live this way? Just two blocks away was Maria’s apartment…Ralston
Thorpe’s was around here somewhere…Sherman and Rawlie had gone to
Buckley, St. Paul’s, and Yale together, and now they both worked at
Pierce andandandand Pierce. Rawlie had moved from a sixteen-room
apartment on Fifth Avenue to the top two floors of a brownstone
somewhere along here after his divorce. Very depressing. Sherman had
taken a nice big step toward a divorce last night, hadn’t he? Not only
had Judy caught him, in flagrante telephone, as it were, but then he,
abject creature of lust that he was, had gone ahead and gotten
laid—right! nothing more than that!—laid!—and not returned home for
forty-five minutes…What would it do to Campbell if he and Judy ever
broke up? He couldn’t imagine his life after such a thing. Weekend
visitation rights with his own daughter? What was that phrase they used?
“Quality time”? So tawdry, so tawdry…Campbell’s soul hardening, month by
month, into a brittle little shell…</p>
<p>By the time he had gone half a block, he hated himself. He felt like
turning around and heading back to the apartment and begging forgiveness
and swearing never again. He felt like it, but he knew he wouldn’t do
it. That would make him late getting to the office, which was much
frowned upon at Pierce andandandand Pierce. No one ever said anything
openly, but you were supposed to get there early and start making
money…and master the universe. A surge of adrenaline—the Giscard! He was
closing in on the biggest deal of his life, the Giscard, the gold-backed
bond—Master of the Universe!—then he sank again. Judy had slept on the
daybed in the dressing room of their bedroom suite. She was still
asleep, or pretending to be, when he got up. Well, thank God for that.
He hadn’t relished another round with her this morning, especially with
Campbell or Bonita listening in. Bonita was one of those South American
servants with perfectly pleasant but nonetheless formal demeanors. To
display temper or anguish in front of her would be a gaffe. No wonder
marriages used to hold up better. Sherman’s parents and their friends
had all had plenty of servants, and the servants had worked long hours
and lived in. If you were unwilling to argue in front of the servants,
then there wasn’t much opportunity to argue at all.</p>
<p>So in the best McCoy manner, just as his father would have done
it—except that he couldn’t imagine his father ever being in such a
jam—Sherman had kept up appearances. He had breakfast in the kitchen
with Campbell, while Bonita got her through breakfast and ready for
school. Bonita had a portable television set in the kitchen, and she
kept turning toward it to watch the news report of the riot in Harlem.
It was hot stuff, but Sherman hadn’t paid attention to it. It had all
seemed so remote…the sort of thing that happened out there…among those
people…He had been busy trying to pump out charm and cheeriness so that
Bonita and Campbell wouldn’t sense the poisonous atmosphere that
enveloped the household.</p>
<p>By now Sherman had walked as far as Lexington Avenue. He always
stopped at a candy store near the corner and bought the Times. As he
turned the corner, a girl was heading toward him, a tall girl with a lot
of blond hair. A large handbag hung from her shoulder by a strap. She
was walking rapidly, as if heading for the subway at Seventy-seventh
Street. She had on a long sweater that was wide open down the front,
revealing a polo shirt with a little embroidered emblem over the left
breast. She wore some sort of go-to-hell white pants that were very
loose and floppy in the legs but exceptionally tight in the crotch.
Exceptionally! There was an astonishing crevice. Sherman stared and then
looked at her face. She stared right back. She looked him right in the
eye and smiled. She didn’t slow down or give him a provocative look. It
was a confident, optimistic look that as much as said, “Hi! We’re a
couple of good-looking animals, aren’t we!” So frank! So unabashed! So
eagerly immodest!</p>
<p>In the candy store, after paying for the Times, Sherman turned to go
out the door and his eyes swept across a magazine rack. The salmon flesh
jumped out at him…girls…boys…girls with girls…boys with boys…girls with
boys…girls with bare breasts, girls with bare bottoms…girls with
paraphernalia…a happy grinning riot of pornography, a rout, an orgy, a
hog wallow…On the cover of one magazine is a girl wearing only a pair of
high-heeled shoes and a loincloth…Except that it isn’t a loincloth, it’s
a snake…Somehow it’s wedged in her groin and looking right at
Sherman…She’s looking right at him, too…On her face is the sunniest,
most unaffected smile imaginable…It’s the face of the girl who serves
you a chocolate-chip ice-cream cone at the Baskin-Robbins…</p>
<p>Sherman resumed his walk toward First Avenue in a state of agitation.
It was in the air! It was a wave! Everywhere! Inescapable!…Sex!…There
for the taking!…It walked down the street, as bold as you please!…It was
splashed all over the shops! If you were a young man and halfway alive,
what chance did you have?…Technically, he had been unfaithful to his
wife. Well, sure…but who could remain monogamous with this, this, this
tidal wave of concupiscence rolling across the world? Christ almighty! A
Master of the Universe couldn’t be a saint, after all…It was
unavoidable. For Christ’s sake, you can’t dodge snowflakes, and this was
a blizzard! He had merely been caught at it, that was all, or halfway
caught at it. It meant nothing. It had no moral dimension. It was
nothing more than getting soaking wet. By the time he reached the
cabstand at First and Seventy-ninth, he had just about worked it out in
his mind.</p>
<p>At Seventy-ninth Street and First Avenue the taxis lined up every day
to take the young Masters of the Universe down to Wall Street. According
to the regulations, every cabdriver was supposed to take you anywhere
you wanted to go, but the drivers in the line at Seventy-ninth and First
wouldn’t budge unless you were going down to Wall Street or close to it.
From the cabstand they swung two blocks east and then went down along
the East River on the highway, the FDR, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Drive.</p>
<p>It was a ten-dollar ride each morning, but what was that to a Master
of the Universe? Sherman’s father had always taken the subway to Wall
Street, even when he was the chief executive officer of Dunning Sponget
andandandand Leach. Even now, at the age of seventy-one, when he took
his daily excursions to Dunning Sponget to breathe the same air as his
lawyer cronies for three or four hours, he went by subway. It was a
matter of principle. The more grim the subways became, the more graffiti
those people scrawled on the cars, the more gold chains they snatched
off girls’ necks, the more old men they mugged, the more women they
pushed in front of the trains, the more determined was John Campbell
McCoy that they weren’t going to drive him off the New York City
subways. But to the new breed, the young breed, the masterful breed,
Sherman’s breed, there was no such principle. Insulation! That was the
ticket. That was the term Rawlie Thorpe used. “If you want to live in
New York,” he once told Sherman, “you’ve got to insulate, insulate,
insulate,” meaning insulate yourself from those people. The cynicism and
smugness of the idea struck Sherman as very au courant. If you could go
breezing down the FDR Drive in a taxi, then why file into the trenches
of the urban wars?</p>
<p>The driver was…a Turk? An Armenian? Sherman tried to make out his
name on the card in the frame on the dashboard. Once the taxi reached
the Drive, he settled back to read the Times. There was a picture on the
front page of a mob of people on a stage and the Mayor standing near a
podium, staring at them. The riot, no doubt. He began to read the story,
but his mind wandered. The sun was beginning to break through the
clouds. He could see it on the river, off to his left. At this moment
the poor filthy river sparkled. It was a sunny day in May, after all. Up
ahead, the towers of New York Hospital rose straight up from the edge of
the highway. There was a sign for the East Seventy-first Street exit,
the one his father had always taken when they drove back from
Southampton on Sunday evenings. The very sight of the hospital and the
exit made Sherman think of—no, not so much think of as feel the house on
Seventy-third Street with its Knickerbocker-green rooms. He had grown up
in those pale grayish-green rooms and trudged up and down those four
flights of narrow stairs believing that he was living in the height of
elegance in the household of the mighty John Campbell McCoy, the Lion of
Dunning Sponget andandandand Leach. Only recently had it dawned on him
that back in 1948, when his parents had bought and renovated that house,
they had been a mildly adventurous young couple, tackling what at the
time was an old wreck in a down-at-the-heels block, keeping a stern eye
on costs every step of the way, and taking pride in what a proper house
they had created for a relatively modest amount. Christ! If his father
ever found out how much he had paid for his apartment and how he had
financed it, he’d have a stroke! Two million six hundred thousand
dollars, with ,800,000 of it borrowed…1,000 a month in principal and
interest with a million-dollar balloon payment due in two years…The Lion
of Dunning Sponget would be appalled…and, worse than appalled,
wounded…wounded at the thought of how his endlessly repeated lessons
concerning duty, debt, ostentation, and proportion had whistled straight
through his son’s skull…</p>
<p>Had his father ever played around? It wasn’t out of the question. He
was a handsome man. He had the Chin. Yet Sherman couldn’t imagine
it.</p>
<p>And by the time he saw the Brooklyn Bridge up ahead, he had stopped
trying to. In a few minutes he would be on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The investment-banking firm of Pierce andandandand Pierce occupied
the fiftieth, fifty-first, fifty-second, fifty-third, and fifty-fourth
floors of a glass tower that rose up sixty stories from out of the
gloomy groin of Wall Street. The bond trading room, where Sherman
worked, was on the fiftieth. Every day he stepped out of an
aluminum-walled elevator into what looked like the reception area of one
of those new London hotels catering to the Yanks. Near the elevator door
was a fake fireplace and an antique mahogany mantelpiece with great
bunches of fruit carved on each corner. Out in front of the fake
fireplace was a brass fence or fender, as they called it in country
homes in the west of England. In the appropriate months a fake fire
glowed within, casting flickering lights upon a prodigious pair of brass
andirons. The wall surrounding it was covered in more mahogany, rich and
reddish, done in linen-fold panels carved so deep, you could feel the
expense in the tips of your fingers by just looking at them.</p>
<p>All of this reflected the passion of Pierce andandandand Pierce’s
chief executive officer, Eugene Lopwitz, for things British. Things
British—library ladders, bowfront consoles, Sheraton legs, Chippendale
backs, cigar cutters, tufted club chairs, Wilton-weave carpet—were
multiplying on the fiftieth floor at Pierce andandandand Pierce day by
day. Alas, there wasn’t much Eugene Lopwitz could do about the ceiling,
which was barely eight feet above the floor. The floor had been raised
one foot. Beneath it ran enough cables and wires to electrify Guatemala.
The wires provided the power for the computer terminals and telephones
of the bond trading room. The ceiling had been lowered one foot, to make
room for light housings and air-conditioning ducts and a few more miles
of wire. The floor had risen; the ceiling had descended; it was as if
you were in an English mansion that had been squashed.</p>
<p>No sooner did you pass the fake fireplace than you heard an ungodly
roar, like the roar of a mob. It came from somewhere around the corner.
You couldn’t miss it. Sherman McCoy headed straight for it, with relish.
On this particular morning, as on every morning, it resonated with his
very gizzard.</p>
<p>He turned the corner, and there it was: the bond trading room of
Pierce andandandand Pierce. It was a vast space, perhaps sixty by eighty
feet, but with the same eight-foot ceiling bearing down on your head. It
was an oppressive space with a ferocious glare, writhing silhouettes,
and the roar. The glare came from a wall of plate glass that faced
south, looking out over New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty, Staten
Island, and the Brooklyn and New Jersey shores. The writhing silhouettes
were the arms and torsos of young men, few of them older than forty.
They had their suit jackets off. They were moving about in an agitated
manner and sweating early in the morning and shouting, which created the
roar. It was the sound of well-educated young white men baying for money
on the bond market.</p>
<p>“Pick up the fucking phone, please!” a chubby, pink-faced member of
the Harvard Class of 1976 screamed at someone two rows of desks away.
The room was like a newspaper city room in that there were no partitions
and no signs of visible rank. Everyone sat at light gray metal desks in
front of veal-colored computer terminals with black screens. Rows of
green-diode letters and numbers came skidding across.</p>
<p>“I said please pick up the fucking phone! I mean holy shit!” There
were dark half-moons in the armpits of his shirt, and the day had just
begun.</p>
<p>A member of the Yale Class of 1973 with a neck that seemed to
protrude twelve inches out of his shirt stared at a screen and screamed
over the telephone at a broker in Paris: “If you can’t see the fucking
screen…Oh, for Christ’s sake, Jean-Pierre, that’s the buyer’s five
million! The buyer’s! Nothing further’s coming in!”</p>
<p>Then he covered the telephone with his hand and looked straight up at
the ceiling and said out loud to no one, except Mammon, “The frogs! The
fucking frogs!”</p>
<p>Four desks away, a member of the Stanford Class of 1979 was sitting
down, staring at a sheet of paper on his desk and holding a telephone to
his ear. His right foot was up on the stirrup of a portable shoeshine
stand, and a black man named Felix, who was about fifty—or was he about
sixty?—was humped over his foot, stropping his shoe with a high-shine
rag. All day long Felix moved from desk to desk, shining the shoes of
young bond traders and salesmen as they worked, at three dollars per,
counting the tip. Seldom was a word exchanged; Felix scarcely registered
on their maculae. Just then Stanford ’79 rose from his chair, his eyes
still fastened on the sheet of paper, the telephone still at his ear—and
his right foot still on the shoeshine stirrup—and he shouted: “Well
then, why do you think everybody’s stripping the fucking
twenty-years?”</p>
<p>Never took his foot off the shoeshine stand! What powerful legs he
must have! thought Sherman. Sherman sat down before his own telephone
and computer terminals. The shouts, the imprecations, the
gesticulations, the fucking fear and greed, enveloped him, and he loved
it. He was the number one bond salesman, “the biggest producer,” as the
phrase went, in the bond trading room of Pierce andandandand Pierce on
the fiftieth floor, and he loved the very roar of the storm.</p>
<p>“This Goldman order really fucked things up good!”</p>
<p>“—step up to the fucking plate and—”</p>
<p>“—bid 8½—”</p>
<p>“I’m away by two thirty-seconds!”</p>
<p>“Somebody’s painting you a fucking picture! Can’t you see that?”</p>
<p>“I’ll take an order and buy ’em at 6-plus!”</p>
<p>“Hit the five-year!”</p>
<p>“Sell five!”</p>
<p>“You couldn’t do ten?”</p>
<p>“You think this thing continues up?”</p>
<p>“Strip fever in the twenty-year! That’s all these jerks keep talking
about!”</p>
<p>“—a hundred million July-nineties at the buck—”</p>
<p>“—naked short—”</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ, what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“I don’t fucking believe this!”</p>
<p>“Holy fucking shit!” shouted the Yale men and the Harvard men and the
Stanford men. “Ho-lee fuc-king shit.”</p>
<p>How these sons of the great universities, these legatees of
Jefferson, Emerson, Thoreau, William James, Frederick Jackson Turner,
William Lyons Phelps, Samuel Flagg Bemis, and the other three-name
giants of American scholarship—how these inheritors of the lux and the
veritas now flocked to Wall Street and to the bond trading room of
Pierce andandandand Pierce! How the stories circulated on every campus!
If you weren’t making 50,000 a year within five years, then you were
either grossly stupid or grossly lazy. That was the word. By age thirty,
00,000—and that sum had the taint of the mediocre. By age forty you were
either making a million a year or you were timid and incompetent. Make
it now! That motto burned in every heart, like myocarditis. Boys on Wall
Street, mere boys, with smooth jawlines and clean arteries, boys still
able to blush, were buying three-million-dollar apartments on Park and
Fifth. (Why wait?) They were buying thirty-room, four-acre summer places
in Southampton, places built in the 1920s and written off in the 1950s
as white elephants, places with decaying servants’ wings, and they were
doing over the servants’ wings, too, and even adding on. (Why not? We’ve
got the servants.) They had carnival rides trucked in and installed on
the great green lawns for their children’s birthday parties, complete
with teams of carnival workers to operate them. (A thriving little
industry.)</p>
<p>And where did all of this astonishing new money come from? Sherman
had heard Gene Lopwitz discourse on that subject. In the Lopwitz
analysis, they had Lyndon Johnson to thank. Ever so quietly, the U.S.
had started printing money by the billions to finance the war in
Vietnam. Before anyone, even Johnson, knew what was happening, a
worldwide inflation had begun. Everyone woke up to it when the Arabs
suddenly jacked up oil prices in the early 1970s. In no time, markets of
all sorts became heaving crap-shoots: gold, silver, copper, currencies,
bank certificates, corporate notes—even bonds. For decades the bond
business had been the bedridden giant of Wall Street. At firms such as
Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Pierce andandandand
Pierce, twice as much money had always changed hands on the bond market
as on the stock market. But prices had budged by only pennies at a time,
and mostly they went down. As Lopwitz put it, “The bond market has been
going down ever since the Battle of Midway.” The Battle of Midway
(Sherman had to look it up) was in the Second World War. The Pierce
andandandand Pierce bond department had consisted of only twenty souls,
twenty rather dull souls known as the Bond Bores. The less promising
members of the firm were steered into bonds, where they could do no
harm.</p>
<p>Sherman resisted the thought that it had been even thus when he
entered the bond department. Well, there was no more talk about Bond
Bores these days…Oh no! Not at all! The bond market had caught fire, and
experienced salesmen such as himself were all at once much in demand.
All of a sudden, in investment houses all over Wall Street, the
erstwhile Bond Bores were making so much money they took to congregating
after work in a bar on Hanover Square called Harry’s, to tell war
stories…and assure one another this wasn’t dumb luck but, rather, a
surge of collective talent. Bonds now represented four-fifths of Pierce
andandandand Pierce’s business, and the young hotshots, the Yalies,
Harvards, and Stanfords, were desperate to get to the bond trading room
of Pierce andandandand Pierce, and at this very moment their voices
ricocheted off Eugene Lopwitz’s linen-fold mahogany walls.</p>
<p>Masters of the Universe! The roar filled Sherman’s soul with hope,
confidence, esprit de corps, and righteousness. Yes, righteousness! Judy
understood none of this, did she? None of it. Oh, he noticed her eyes
glazing over when he talked about it. Moving the lever that moves the
world was what he was doing—and all she wanted to know was why he never
made it home for dinner. When he did make it home for dinner, what did
she want to talk about? Her precious interior-decorating business and
how she had gotten their apartment into Architectural Digest, which,
frankly, to a true Wall Streeter was a fucking embarrassment. Did she
commend him for the hundreds of thousands of dollars that made her
decorating and her lunches and whatever the hell else she did possible?
No, she did not. She took it for granted…</p>
<p>…and so forth and so on. Within ninety seconds, emboldened by the
mighty roar of the bond trading room of Pierce andandandand Pierce,
Sherman managed to work up a good righteous head of resentment against
this woman who had dared make him feel guilty.</p>
<p>He picked up the telephone and was ready to resume work on the
greatest coup of his young career, the Giscard, when he spotted
something out of the corner of his eye. He detected it—righteously!—amid
that great bondscape of writhing limbs and torsos. Arguello was reading
a newspaper.</p>
<p>Ferdinand Arguello was a junior bond salesman, twenty-five or-six
years old, from Argentina. He was leaning back in his chair nonchalantly
reading a newspaper, and even from here Sherman could see what it was:
The Racing Form. The Racing Form! The young man looked like a caricature
of a South American polo player. He was slender and handsome; he had
thick wavy black hair, combed straight back. He was wearing a pair of
red silk moiré suspenders. Silk moiré. The bond department of Pierce
andandandand Pierce was like an Air Force fighter squadron. Sherman knew
it even if this young South American didn’t. As the number one bond
salesman, Sherman had no official rank. Nevertheless, he occupied a
moral eminence. You were either capable of doing the job and willing to
devote 100 percent to the job, or you got out. The eighty members of the
department received a base salary, a safety net, of 20,000 a year each.
This was regarded as a laughably small sum. The rest of their income
came from commissions and profit-sharing. Sixty-five percent of the
department’s profits went to Pierce andandandand Pierce. But 35 percent
was split among the eighty bond salesmen and traders themselves. All for
one and one for all, and lots for oneself! And therefore…no slackers
allowed! no deadwood! no lightweights! no loafers! You headed straight
for your desk, your telephone, and your computer terminal in the
morning. The day didn’t start with small talk and coffee and perusals of
The Wall Street Journal and the financial pages of the Times, much less
The Racing Form. You were expected to get on the telephone and start
making money. If you left the office, even for lunch, you were expected
to give your destination and a telephone number to one of the “sales
assistants,” who were really secretaries, so that you could be summoned
immediately if a new issue of bonds came in (and had to be sold fast).
If you went out for lunch, it better have something directly to do with
selling bonds for Pierce andandandand Pierce. Otherwise—sit here by the
telephone and order in from the deli like the rest of the squadron.</p>
<p>Sherman walked to Arguello’s desk and stood over him. “What are you
doing, Ferdi?”</p>
<p>From the moment the young man looked up, Sherman could tell he knew
what the question meant and that he knew he was wrong. But if there was
one thing an Argentine aristocrat knew, it was how to brazen it out.</p>
<p>Arguello locked a level gaze onto Sherman’s eyes and said, in a voice
just slightly louder than necessary: “I’m reading The Racing Form.”</p>
<p>“What for?”</p>
<p>“What for? Because four of our horses are racing at Lafayette today.
That’s a track outside of Chicago.”</p>
<p>With this he resumed reading the newspaper.</p>
<p>It was the our that did it. Our was supposed to remind you that you
were in the presence of the House of Arguello, lords of the pampas.
Besides that, the little shit was wearing a pair of red silk moiré
suspenders.</p>
<p>“Look…sport,” said Sherman. “I want you to put that sheet away.”</p>
<p>Challengingly: “What did you say?”</p>
<p>“You heard me. I said put that fucking sheet away!” It was supposed
to come out calmly and firmly, but it came out furiously. It came out
furiously enough to finish off Judy, Pollard Browning, the doorman, and
a would-be mugger.</p>
<p>The young man was speechless.</p>
<p>“If I ever see you with a Racing Form in here again, you can go sit
outside Chicago and make your money! You can sit on the clubhouse turn
and bet perfectas! This is Pierce andandandand Pierce, not OTB!”</p>
<p>Arguello was crimson. He was paralyzed with anger. All he could do
was beam a ray of pure hatred at Sherman. Sherman, the righteous
wrathful one, turned away, and as he did, he noticed with satisfaction
that the young man was slowly closing the open expanse of The Racing
Form.</p>
<p>Wrathful! Righteous! Sherman was elated. People were staring. Good!
Idleness was a sin not against the self or against God but against
Mammon and Pierce andandandand Pierce. If he had to be the one to call
this greaseball to accounts, then—but he regretted the greaseball, even
in his thoughts. He considered himself as part of the new era and the
new breed, a Wall Street egalitarian, a Master of the Universe who was a
respecter only of performance. No longer did Wall Street or Pierce
andandandand Pierce mean Protestant Good Family. There were plenty of
prominent Jewish investment bankers. Lopwitz himself was Jewish. There
were plenty of Irishmen, Greeks, and Slavs. The fact that not one of the
eighty members of the bond department was black or female didn’t bother
him. Why should it? It didn’t bother Lopwitz, who took the position that
the bond trading room at Pierce andandandand Pierce was no place for
symbolic gestures.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sherman.”</p>
<p>He happened to be passing Rawlie Thorpe’s desk. Rawlie was bald,
except for a fringe of hair around the back of his head, and yet he
still looked youthful. He was a great wearer of button-down shirts and
Shep Miller suspenders. The button-down collars had a flawless roll.</p>
<p>“What was that all about?” he asked Sherman.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t believe it,” said Sherman. “He’s over there with The
Racing Form, working on fucking horse charts.” He felt compelled to
embellish the offense a bit.</p>
<p>Rawlie started laughing. “Well, he’s young. He’s probably had it with
electric doughnuts.”</p>
<p>“Had it with what?”</p>
<p>Rawlie picked up his telephone and pointed to the mouthpiece. “See
that? That’s an electric doughnut.”</p>
<p>Sherman stared. It did look sort of like a doughnut, with a lot of
little holes instead of one big one.</p>
<p>“It just dawned on me today,” said Rawlie. “All I do all day is talk
to other electric doughnuts. I just hung up from talking to a guy over
at Drexel. I sold him a million and a half Joshua Tree bonds.” On Wall
Street you didn’t say a million and a half dollars’ worth of bonds. You
said a million and a half bonds. “That’s some goddamned outfit in
Arizona. His name is Earl. I don’t even know his last name. Over the
past two years I bet I’ve done a couple dozen transactions with him,
fifty, sixty million bonds, and I don’t even know his last name, and
I’ve never met him, and I probably never will. He’s an electric
doughnut.”</p>
<p>Sherman didn’t find this amusing. In some way it was a repudiation of
his triumph over the shiftless young Argentinian. It was a cynical
denial of his very righteousness itself. Rawlie was a very amusing man,
but he hadn’t been himself since his divorce. Maybe he was no longer
such a great squadron warrior, either.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Sherman, managing a half smile for his old friend.
“Well, I gotta go call some a my doughnuts.”</p>
<p>Back at his desk Sherman settled down to the work at hand. He stared
at the little green symbols trucking across the computer screen in front
of him. He picked up the telephone. The French gold-backed bond…A weird,
very promising situation, and he had discovered it when one of the
fellows, quite casually, mentioned the bond, in passing, one evening at
Harry’s.</p>
<p>Back in the innocent year 1973, on the eve of the heaving crapshoot,
the French government had issued a bond known as the Giscard, after the
French President, Giscard d’Estaing, with a face value of .5 billion.
The Giscard had an interesting feature: it was backed by gold. So as the
price of gold went up and down, so did the price of the Giscard. Since
then the price of both gold and the French franc had shot up and down so
crazily, American investors had long since lost interest in the Giscard.
But lately, with gold holding firm in the 00 range, Sherman had
discovered that an American buying Giscards stood to make two to three
times the interest he could make on any U.S. government bond, plus a 30
percent profit when the Giscard matured. It was a sleeping beauty. The
big danger would be a drop in the value of the franc. Sherman had
neutralized that with a scheme for selling francs short as a hedge.</p>
<p>The only real problem was the complexity of the whole thing. It took
big, sophisticated investors to understand it. Big, sophisticated,
trusting investors; no newcomer could talk anybody into putting millions
into the Giscard. You had to have a track record. You had to have
talent—genius!—mastery of the universe!—like Sherman McCoy, biggest
producer at Pierce andandandand Pierce. He had convinced Gene Lopwitz to
put up 00 million of Pierce andandandand Pierce’s money to buy the
Giscard. Gingerly, stealthily, he had bought the bonds from their
various European owners without revealing the mighty hand of Pierce
andandandand Pierce, by using various “blind” brokers. Now came the big
test for a Master of the Universe. There were only about a dozen players
who were likely buyers of anything as esoteric as the Giscard. Of these
Sherman had managed to start negotiations with five: two trust banks,
Traders’ Trust Co. (known as Trader T) and Metroland; two money
managers; and one of his best private clients, Oscar Suder of Cleveland,
who had indicated he would buy 0 million. But by far the most important
was Trader T, which was considering taking half the entire lot, 00
million.</p>
<p>The deal would bring Pierce andandandand Pierce a 1 percent
commission up front— million—for conceiving of the idea and risking its
capital. Sherman’s share, including commissions, bonuses,
profit-sharing, and resale fees, would come to about .75 million. With
that he intended to pay off the horrendous .8 million personal loan he
had taken out to buy the apartment.</p>
<p>So the first order of business today was a call to Bernard Levy, a
Frenchman who was handling the deal at Trader T: a relaxed, friendly
call, the call of a biggest-producing salesman (Master of the Universe),
to remind Levy that although both gold and the franc had fallen in value
yesterday and this morning (on the European exchanges), it meant
nothing; all was well, very well indeed. It was true that he had met
Bernard Levy only once, when he made the original presentation. They had
been conferring on the telephone for months…but electric doughnut?
Cynicism was such a cowardly form of superiority. That was Rawlie’s
great weakness. Rawlie cashed his checks. He wasn’t too cynical to do
that. If he wanted to belly up because he couldn’t deal with his wife,
that was his sad problem.</p>
<p>As Sherman dialed and waited for Bernard Levy to come on the line,
the rousing sound of the greed storm closed in about him once again.
From the desk right in front of his, a tall bug-eyed fellow (Yale ’77):
“Thirty-one bid January eighty-eights—”</p>
<p>From a desk somewhere behind him: “I’m short seventy million
ten-year!”</p>
<p>From he knew not where: “They got their fucking buying shoes on!”</p>
<p>“I’m in the box!”</p>
<p>“—long 125—”</p>
<p>“—a million four-years from Midland—”</p>
<p>“Who’s fucking around with the W-Is?”</p>
<p>“I tell you, I’m in the box!”</p>
<p>“—bid 80½—”</p>
<p>“—buy ’em at 6-plus—”</p>
<p>“—pick up 2½ basis points—”</p>
<p>“Forget it! It’s nut-cutting time!”</p>
<p>At ten o’clock, Sherman, Rawlie, and five others convened in the
conference room of Eugene Lopwitz’s suite of offices to decide on Pierce
andandandand Pierce’s strategy for the main event of the day in the bond
markets, which was a U.S. Treasury auction of 10 billion bonds maturing
in twenty years. It was a measure of the importance of the bond business
to Pierce andandandand Pierce that Lopwitz’s offices opened right out
into the bond trading room.</p>
<p>The conference room had no conference table. It looked like the
lounge in the English hotel for the Yanks where they serve tea. It was
full of small antique tables and cabinets. They were so old, brittle,
and highly polished, you got the feeling that if you flicked one of them
hard with your middle finger, it would shatter. At the same time, a wall
of plate glass shoved a view of the Hudson River and the rotting piers
of New Jersey into your face.</p>
<p>Sherman sat in a George II armchair. Rawlie sat next to him, in an
old chair with a back shaped like a shield. In other antique or antiqued
chairs, with Sheraton and Chippendale side tables beside them, were the
head government trader, George Connor, who was two years younger than
Sherman; his deputy, Vic Scaasi, who was only twenty-eight; the chief
market analyst, Paul Feiffer; and Arnold Parch, the executive vice
president, who was Lopwitz’s first lieutenant.</p>
<p>Everyone in the room sat in a classic chair and stared at a small
brown plastic speaker on top of a cabinet. The cabinet was a
220-year-old Adam bowfront, from the period when the brothers Adam liked
to paint pictures and ornate borders on wooden furniture. On the center
panel was an oval-shaped painting of a Greek maiden sitting in a dell or
grotto in which lacy leaves receded fuzzily in deepening shades of green
into a dusky teal sky. The thing had cost an astonishing amount of
money. The plastic speaker was the size of a bedside clock radio.
Everyone stared at it, waiting for the voice of Gene Lopwitz. Lopwitz
was in London, where it was now 4:00 P.M. He would preside over this
meeting by telephone.</p>
<p>An indistinct noise came out of the speaker. It might have been a
voice and it might have been an airplane. Arnold Parch rose from his
armchair and approached the Adam cabinet and looked at the plastic
speaker and said, “Gene, can you hear me all right?”</p>
<p>He looked imploringly at the plastic speaker, without taking his eyes
off it, as if in fact it were Gene Lopwitz, transformed, the way princes
are transformed into frogs in fairy tales. For a moment the plastic frog
said nothing. Then it spoke.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can hear you, Arnie. There was a lotta cheering going on.”
Lopwitz’s voice sounded as if it were coming from out of a storm drain,
but you could hear it.</p>
<p>“Where are you, Gene?” asked Parch.</p>
<p>“I’m at a cricket match.” Then less clearly: “What’s the name a this
place again?” He was evidently with some other people. “Tottenham Park,
Arnie. I’m on a kind of a terrace.”</p>
<p>“Who’s playing?” Parch smiled, as if to show the plastic frog that
this wasn’t a serious question.</p>
<p>“Don’t get technical on me, Arnie. A lot of very nice young gentlemen
in cable-knit sweaters and white flannel pants, is the best I can tell
you.”</p>
<p>Appreciative laughter broke out in the room, and Sherman felt his own
lips bending into the somehow obligatory smile. He glanced about the
room. Everyone was smiling and chuckling at the brown plastic speaker
except for Rawlie, who had his eyes rolled up in the Oh Brother
mode.</p>
<p>Then Rawlie leaned over toward Sherman and said, in a noisy whisper:
“Look at all these idiots grinning. They think the plastic box has
eyes.”</p>
<p>This didn’t strike Sherman as very funny, since he himself had been
grinning. He was also afraid that Lopwitz’s loyal aide, Parch, would
think he was Rawlie’s confederate in making sport of the maximum
leader.</p>
<p>“Well, everybody’s here, Gene,” Parch said to the box, “and so I’m
gonna get George to fill you in on where we stand on the auction as of
now.”</p>
<p>Parch looked at George Connor and nodded and walked back to his
chair, and Connor got up from his and walked over to the Adam cabinet
and stared at the brown plastic box and said: “Gene? This is
George.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, hi, George,” said the frog. “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Here’s the thing, Gene,” said Connor, standing in front of the Adam
commode, unable to take his eyes off the plastic box, “it feels pretty
good. The old twenties are trading at 8 percent. The traders are telling
us they’ll come in on the new ones at 8.05, but we think they’re playing
games with us. We think we’re gonna get action right down to 8. So
here’s what I figure. We’ll scale in at 8.01, 8.02, 8.03, with the
balance at 8.04. I’m ready to go 60 percent of the issue.”</p>
<p>Which, translated, meant: he was proposing to buy billion of the 0
billion in bonds offered in the auction, with the expectation of a
profit of two thirty-seconds of a dollar—6¼¢—on every one hundred
dollars put up. This was known as “two ticks.”</p>
<p>Sherman couldn’t resist another look at Rawlie. He had a small,
unpleasant smile on his face, and his gaze seemed to pass several
degrees to the right of the Adam commode, toward the Hoboken docks.
Rawlie’s presence was like a glass of ice water in the face. Sherman
resented him all over again. He knew what was on his mind. Here was this
outrageous arriviste, Lopwitz—Sherman knew Rawlie thought of him that
way—trying to play the nob on the terrace of some British cricket club
and at the same time conduct a meeting in New York to decide whether
Pierce andandandand Pierce was going to stake two billion, four billion,
or six billion on a single government bond issue three hours from now.
No doubt Lopwitz had his own audience on hand at the cricket club to
watch this performance, as his great words bounced off a communications
satellite somewhere up in the empyrean and hit Wall Street. Well, it
wasn’t hard to find something laughable in it, but Lopwitz was, in
truth, a Master of the Universe. Lopwitz was about forty-five years old.
Sherman wanted nothing less seven years down the line, when he was
forty-five. To be astride the Atlantic…with billions at stake! Rawlie
could snigger…and sink into his kneecaps…but to think what Lopwitz now
had in his grasp, to think what he made each year, just from Pierce
andandandand Pierce, which was at least 5 million, to think of the kind
of life he led—and what Sherman thought of first was Lopwitz’s young
wife, Snow White. That was what Rawlie called her. Hair as dark as
ebony, lips as red as blood, skin as white as snow…She was Lopwitz’s
fourth wife, French, a countess, apparently, no more than twenty-five or
twenty-six, with an accent like Catherine Deneuve doing a bath-oil
commercial. She was something…Sherman had met her at a party at the
Petersons’. She had put her hand on his forearm, just to make a point in
conversation—but the way she kept the pressure on his arm and stared at
him from about eight inches away! She was a young and frisky animal.
Lopwitz had taken what he wanted. He had wanted a young and frisky
animal with lips as red as blood and skin as white as snow, and that was
what he had taken. What had ever happened to the other three Mrs. Eugene
Lopwitzes was a question Sherman had never heard brought up. When you
had reached Lopwitz’s level, it didn’t even matter.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, that sounds all right, George,” said the plastic frog.
“What about Sherman? Are you there, Sherman?”</p>
<p>“Hi, Gene!” said Sherman, rising from the George II armchair. His own
voice sounded very odd to him, now that he was talking to a plastic box,
and he didn’t dare even take a quick glance at Rawlie as he walked over
to the Adam commode and took his stance and stared, rapt, at the machine
on top.</p>
<p>“Gene, all my customers are talking 8.05. My gut feeling, though, is
that they’re on our side. The market has a good tone. I think we can bid
ahead of the customer interest.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said the voice in the box, “but just make sure you and George
stay on top a the trading accounts. I don’t wanna hear about Salomon or
anybody horsing around with shorts.”</p>
<p>Sherman found himself marveling at the frog’s wisdom.</p>
<p>Some sort of throttled roar came over the speaker. Everybody stared
at it.</p>
<p>Lopwitz’s voice returned. “Somebody just hit the hell outta the
ball,” he said. “The ball’s kinda dead, though. Well, you kinda hadda be
there.” It wasn’t clear what he meant by that. “Well, look, George. Can
you hear me, George?”</p>
<p>Connor hopped to it, rose from his chair, hustled over to the Adam
commode.</p>
<p>“I can hear you, Gene.”</p>
<p>“I was just gonna say, if you feel like stepping up to the plate and
taking a good whack at it today, go ahead. It sounds okay.”</p>
<p>And that was that.</p>
<p>At forty-five seconds before the auction deadline of 1:00 P.M.,
George Connor, at a telephone in the middle of the bond trading room,
read off his final scaled-in bids to a Pierce andandandand Pierce
functionary sitting at a telephone at the Federal Building, which was
the physical site of the auction. The bids averaged 9.62643 per 00 worth
of bonds. Within a few seconds after 1:00 P.M., Pierce andandandand
Pierce now owned, as planned, billion worth of the twenty-year bond. The
bond department had four hours in which to create a favorable market.
Vic Scaasi led the charge on the bond trading desk, reselling the bonds
mainly to the brokerage houses—by telephone. Sherman and Rawlie led the
bond salesmen, reselling the bonds mainly to insurance companies and
trust banks—by telephone. By 2:00 P.M., the roar in the bond trading
room, fueled more by fear than greed, was unearthly. They all shouted
and sweated and swore and devoured their electric doughnuts.</p>
<p>By 5:00 P.M. they had sold 40 percent—.4 billion—of the billion at an
average price of 9.75062 per 00 worth of bonds, for a profit of not two
but four ticks! Four ticks! That was a profit of twelve and a half cents
per one hundred dollars. Four ticks! To the eventual retail buyer of
these bonds, whether an individual, a corporation or an institution,
this spread was invisible. But—four ticks! To Pierce andandandand Pierce
it meant a profit of almost million for an afternoon’s work. And it
wouldn’t stop there. The market was holding firm and edging up. Within
the next week they might easily make an additional to 0 million on the
3.6 billion bonds remaining. Four ticks!</p>
<p>By five o’clock Sherman was soaring on adrenaline. He was part of the
pulverizing might of Pierce andandandand Pierce, Masters of the
Universe. The audacity of it all was breathtaking. To risk billion in
one afternoon to make two ticks—six and a quarter cents per one hundred
dollars—and then to make four ticks—four ticks!—the audacity!—the
audacity! Was there any more exciting power on the face of the earth?
Let Lopwitz watch all the cricket matches he wants to! Let him play the
plastic frog! Master of the Universe—the audacity!</p>
<p>The audacity of it flowed through Sherman’s limbs and lymph channels
and loins. Pierce andandandand Pierce was the power, and he was wired
into the power, and the power hummed and surged in his very innards.</p>
<p>Judy…He hadn’t thought of her for hours. What was a single, albeit
boneheaded, telephone call…on the stupendous ledger kept by Pierce
andandandand Pierce? The fiftieth floor was for people who weren’t
afraid to take what they wanted. And, Christ, he didn’t want much,
compared to what he, a Master of the Universe, should rightfully have.
All he wanted was to be able to kick the gong around when he pleased, to
have the simple pleasures due all mighty warriors.</p>
<p>Where did she get off, giving him such a hard time?</p>
<p>If Middle Age wishes the continued support and escort of a Master of
the Universe, then she must allow him the precious currency he has
earned, which is youth and beauty and juicy jugs and loamy loins—</p>
<p>It made no sense! Somehow, for no explicable reason, Judy had always
had his number. She looked down on him—from a wholly fictive elevation;
nevertheless, she looked down on him. Still the daughter of Professor
Miller, E. (for Egbord!) Ronald Miller of DesPortes University,
Terwilliger, Wisconsin, poor stodgy Professor Miller, in his rotting
tweeds, whose one claim to fame was a rather mealymouthed attack
(Sherman had once plowed through it) on his fellow Wisconsinite, Senator
Joseph McCarthy, in the magazine Aspects in 1955. Yet, back there in the
cocoon of their early days together in the Village, Sherman had
validated her claim. He had enjoyed telling Judy that while he worked on
Wall Street, he was not of Wall Street and was only using Wall Street.
He had been pleased when she condescended to admire him for the
enlightenment that was stirring in his soul. Somehow she was assuring
him that his own father, John Campbell McCoy, the Lion of Dunning
Sponget, was a rather pedestrian figure, after all, a high-class
security guard for other people’s capital. As to why that might be
important to him, Sherman didn’t even know how to speculate. His
interest in psychoanalytical theory, never lively, had ended one day at
Yale when Rawlie Thorpe had referred to it as “a Jewish science”
(precisely the attitude that had most troubled and infuriated Freud
seventy-five years earlier).</p>
<p>But that was all part of the past, of his childhood, his childhood on
East Seventy-third Street and his childhood in the Village. This was a
new era! This was a new Wall Street!—and Judy was…an article left over
from his childhood…and yet she lived on and grew older,
thinner…handsome…</p>
<p>Sherman leaned back in his chair and surveyed the bond trading room.
The processions of phosphorescent green characters still skidded across
the faces of the computer terminals, but the roar had subsided to
something more like locker-room laughter. George Connor stood beside Vic
Scaasi’s chair with his hands in his pockets, just chatting. Vic arched
his back and rolled his shoulders and seemed about to yawn. There was
Rawlie, reared back in his chair, talking on the telephone, grinning and
running his hand over his bald pate. Victorious warriors after the
fray…Masters of the Universe…</p>
<p>And she has the gall to cause him grief over a telephone call!</p>
