<h4 id="saturdays-saturnine-lunchtime">10. Saturday’s Saturnine
Lunchtime</h4>
<p>At that moment, also on Long Island, but sixty miles to the east, on
the south shore, the beach club had just opened for the season. The club
owned a low, rambling stucco building athwart the dunes and about a
hundred yards of beachfront, bounded by two dock ropes threaded through
metal stanchions. The club facilities were spacious and comfortable but
were maintained, devoutly, in the Brahmin Ascetic or Boarding School
Scrubbed Wood mode that had been fashionable in the 1920s and 1930s. So
it was that Sherman McCoy now sat on the deck at a perfectly plain
wooden table under a large faded umbrella. With him were his father, his
mother, Judy, and, intermittently, Campbell.</p>
<p>You could step or, in Campbell’s case, run directly from the deck
onto the sand that lay between the two ropes, and Campbell was just now
somewhere out there with Rawlie Thorpe’s little girl, Eliza, and Garland
Reed’s little girl, MacKenzie. Sherman was attentively not listening to
his father tell Judy how Talbot, the club’s bartender, had made his
martini, which was the color of pale tea.</p>
<p>“…know why, but I’ve always preferred a martini made with sweet
vermouth. Shaken until it foams. Talbot always gives me an
argument…”</p>
<p>His father’s thin lips were opening and closing, and his noble chin
was going up and down, and his charming raconteur’s smile was wrinkling
his cheeks. Once, when Sherman was Campbell’s age, his father and mother
had taken him for a picnic out on the sand beyond the ropes. There was a
spirit of adventure about this excursion. They were roughing it. The
strangers out there on the sand, the handful who remained in the late
afternoon, turned out to be harmless.</p>
<p>Now Sherman let his eyes slide off his father’s face to explore the
sand beyond the ropes again. It made him squint, because where the
cluster of tables and umbrellas ended, the beach was sheer dazzling
light. So he shortened his range and found himself focusing on a head at
the table just behind his father. It was the unmistakable round head of
Pollard Browning. Pollard was sitting there with Lewis Sanderson the
elder, who had always been Ambassador Sanderson when Sherman was growing
up, and Mrs. Sanderson and Coker Channing and his wife. How Channing had
ever become a member was beyond Sherman, except that he made a career of
ingratiating himself with people like Pollard. Pollard was president of
the club. Christ, he was president of Sherman’s co-op board, too. That
dense, round head…But given his current frame of mind, Sherman was
reassured by the sight of it…dense as a rock, solid as a rock, rich as
Croesus, immovable.</p>
<p>His father’s lips stopped moving for an instant, and he heard his
mother say, “Dear, don’t bore Judy with martinis. It makes you sound so
old. Nobody but you drinks them any longer.”</p>
<p>“Here at the beach they do. If you don’t believe me—”</p>
<p>“It’s like talking about flappers or rumble seats or dining cars
or—”</p>
<p>“If you don’t believe me—”</p>
<p>“—K rations or the Hit Parade.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t believe me—”</p>
<p>“Did you ever hear of a singer named Bonnie Baker?” She directed this
at Judy, ignoring Sherman’s father. “Bonnie Baker was the star of the
Hit Parade, on the radio. Wee Bonnie Baker she was called. The entire
country used to listen to her. Totally forgotten now, I expect.”</p>
<p>Sixty-five years old and still beautiful, thought Sherman. Tall,
lean, erect, thick white hair—refused to color it—an aristocrat, much
more of one than his father, with all his dedication to being one—and
still chipping away at the base of the statue of the great Lion of
Dunning Sponget.</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t have to go back that far,” said Judy. “I was talking
to Garland’s son, Landrum. He’s a junior, I think he said, at
Brown—”</p>
<p>“Garland Reed has a son in college?”</p>
<p>“Sally’s son.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear. I’d totally forgotten about Sally. Isn’t that awful?”</p>
<p>“Not awful. Up-to-date,” said Judy, without much of a smile.</p>
<p>“If you don’t believe me, ask Talbot,” said Sherman’s father.</p>
<p>“Up-to-date!” said his mother, laughing and ignoring the Lion and his
martinis and his Talbot.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” said Judy, “I happened to say something to him about
hippies, and he just stared at me. Never heard of them. Ancient
history.”</p>
<p>“Here at the beach—”</p>
<p>“Like martinis,” Sherman’s mother said to Judy.</p>
<p>“Here at the beach you’re still permitted to enjoy life’s simple
pleasures,” said Sherman’s father, “or you were until a moment ago.”</p>
<p>“Daddy and I went to that little restaurant in Wainscott last night,
Sherman, the one Daddy likes so much, with Inez and Herbert Clark, and
do you know what the owner said to me—you know the pretty little woman
who owns it?”</p>
<p>Sherman nodded yes.</p>
<p>“I find her very jolly,” said his mother. “As we were leaving, she
said to me—well, first I must mention that Inez and Herbert had two
gin-and-tonics apiece, Daddy had his three martinis, and there was wine,
and she said to me—”</p>
<p>“Celeste, your nose is growing. I had one.”</p>
<p>“Well, perhaps not three. Two.”</p>
<p>“Celeste.”</p>
<p>“Well, she thought it was a lot, the owner did. She said to me, ‘I
like my older customers best of all. They’re the only ones who drink
anymore.’ ‘My older customers’! I can’t imagine how she thought that was
supposed to sound to me.”</p>
<p>“She thought you were twenty-five,” said Sherman’s father. Then to
Judy: “All of a sudden I’m married to a White Ribbon.”</p>
<p>“A white ribbon?”</p>
<p>“More ancient history,” he muttered. “Or else I’m married to Miss
Trendy. You always have been up-to-date, Celeste.”</p>
<p>“Only compared to you, darling.” She smiled and put her hand on his
forearm. “I wouldn’t take away your martinis for the world. Talbot’s,
either.”</p>
<p>“I’m not worried about Talbot,” said the Lion.</p>
<p>Sherman had heard his father talk about how he liked his martinis
mixed at least a hundred times, and Judy must have heard it twenty, but
that was all right. It got on his mother’s nerves, not his. It was
comfortable; everything was the same as always. That was the way he
wanted things this weekend; the same, the same, the same, and neatly
bounded by the two ropes.</p>
<p>Just getting out of the apartment, where May I speak to Maria still
poisoned the air, had helped considerably. Judy had driven out early
yesterday afternoon in the station wagon with Campbell, Bonita, and Miss
Lyons, the nanny. He had driven out last night in the Mercedes. This
morning, in the driveway outside the garage behind their big old house
on Old Drover’s Mooring Lane, he had gone over the car in the sunlight.
No evidence at all, that he could detect, of the fracas…Everything was
brighter this morning, including Judy. She had chatted quite amiably at
the breakfast table. Just now she was smiling at his father and mother.
She looked relaxed…and really rather pretty, rather chic…in her polo
shirt and pale yellow Shetland sweater and white slacks…She wasn’t
young, but she did have the kind of fine features that would age
well…Lovely hair…The dieting and the abominable Sports Training…and
age…had taken their toll on her breasts, but she still had a trim little
body…firm…He felt a mild tingle…Perhaps tonight…or the middle of the
afternoon!…Why not?…That might give the thaw, the rebirth of spring, the
return of the sun…a more solid foundation…If she would agree, then
the…ugly business…would be over…Perhaps all the ugly business would be
over. Four days had now passed and there had not been a shred of news
about anything dreadful happening to a tall skinny boy on an expressway
ramp in the Bronx. No one had come knocking at his door. Besides, she
was driving. She had put it that way herself. And whatever happened, he
was morally correct (Nothing to fear from God.) He had been fighting for
his life and for hers…</p>
<p>Maybe the whole thing was one of God’s warnings. Why didn’t he and
Judy and Campbell get out of the madness of New York…and the megalomania
of Wall Street? Who but an arrogant fool would want to be a Master of
the Universe—and take the insane chances he had been taking? A close
call!…Dear God, I swear to you that from now on…Why didn’t they sell the
apartment and move out here to Southampton year round—or to
Tennessee…Tennessee…His grandfather William Sherman McCoy had come to
New York from Knoxville when he was thirty-one…a hick in the eyes of the
Brownings…Well, what was so wrong with good American hicks!…Sherman’s
father had taken him to Knoxville. He had seen the perfectly adequate
house where his grandfather had grown up…A lovely little city, a sober,
reasonable little city, Knoxville…Why didn’t he go there and get a job
in a brokerage house, a regular job, a sane, responsible job, not trying
to spin the world on its head, a nine-to-five job, or whenever it is
they work in places like Knoxville; 0,000 or 00,000 a year, a tenth or
less of what he so foolishly thought he needed now, and it would be
plenty…a Georgian house with a screen porch at one end…an acre or two of
good green lawn, a Snapper lawn mower that he might operate himself
occasionally, a garage with a door that opens with a Genie that you keep
clipped onto the visor of your car, a kitchen with a magnetic bulletin
board where you leave messages for each other, a cozy life, a loving
life, Our Town…</p>
<p>Judy was now smiling at something his father had said, and the Lion
was smiling in pleasure at her appreciation of his wit, and his mother
was smiling at both of them, and at the tables beyond, Pollard was
smiling and Rawlie was smiling and Ambassador Sanderson, his lanky old
legs and all, was smiling, and the sweet sun of early June by the sea
warmed Sherman’s bones, and he relaxed for the first time in two weeks,
and he smiled at Judy and his father and his mother, as if he had
actually been paying attention to their banter.</p>
<p>“Daddy!”</p>
<p>Campbell came running toward him, from out of the sand and the
dazzling light, onto the deck, between the tables.</p>
<p>“Daddy!”</p>
<p>She looked absolutely glorious. Now almost seven years old, she had
lost her babyish features and was a little girl with slender arms and
legs and firm muscles and not a blemish anywhere. She was wearing a pink
bathing suit with the letters of the alphabet printed on it in black and
white. Her skin glowed with sun and exercise. The very sight of her, of
this…vision…brought smiles to the faces of his father and his mother and
Judy. He pivoted his legs out from under the table and opened his arms.
He wanted her to run straight into his embrace.</p>
<p>But she stopped short. She hadn’t come for affection. “Daddy.” She
was breathing hard. She had an important question. “Daddy.”</p>
<p>“Yes, darling!”</p>
<p>“Daddy.” She could scarcely get her breath.</p>
<p>“Take it easy, sweetheart. What is it?”</p>
<p>“Daddy…what do you do?”</p>
<p>What did he do?</p>
<p>“Do? What do you mean, sweetheart?”</p>
<p>“Well, MacKenzie’s daddy makes books, and he has eighty people
working for him.”</p>
<p>“That’s what MacKenzie told you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Oh ho! Eighty people!” said Sherman’s father, in the voice he used
for small children. “My, my, my!”</p>
<p>Sherman could imagine what the Lion thought of Garland Reed. Garland
had inherited his father’s printing business and for ten years had done
nothing with it but keep it alive. The “books” he “made” were printing
jobs given him by the actual publishers, and the products were as likely
to be manuals, club rosters, corporate contracts, and annual reports as
anything even remotely literary. As for the eighty people—eighty
ink-stained wretches was more like it, typesetters, pressmen, and so
forth. At the height of his career the Lion had had two hundred Wall
Street lawyers under his whip, most of them Ivy League.</p>
<p>“But what do you do?” asked Campbell, now growing impatient. She
wanted to get back to MacKenzie to give her report, and something
impressive was clearly called for.</p>
<p>“Well, Sherman, how about it?” said his father with a big grin. “I
want to hear the answer to this myself. I’ve often asked myself what it
is you fellows do exactly. Campbell, that’s an excellent question.”</p>
<p>Campbell smiled, taking her grandfather’s praise at face value.</p>
<p>More irony; and not so welcome this time. The Lion had always
resented his going into the bond business instead of the law, and the
fact that he had prospered at it only made things worse. Sherman began
to feel angry. He couldn’t sit here and present a picture of himself as
a Master of the Universe, not with his father and mother and Judy
hanging on every word. At the same time, he couldn’t give Campbell some
modest depiction of himself as a salesman, one among many, or even as
the chief bond salesman, which would sound pompous without sounding
impressive and wouldn’t mean anything to Campbell in any case—Campbell,
who stood there panting, primed to race back to her little friend, who
had a daddy who made books and had eighty people working for him.</p>
<p>“Well, I deal in bonds, sweetheart. I buy them, I sell them, I—”</p>
<p>“What are bonds? What is deal?”</p>
<p>Now his mother began laughing. “You’ve got to do better than that,
Sherman!”</p>
<p>“Well, honey, bonds are—a bond is—well, let me see, what’s the best
way to explain it to you.”</p>
<p>“Explain it to me, too, Sherman,” said his father. “I must have done
five thousand leveraged purchase contracts, and I always fell asleep
before I could figure out why anyone wanted the bonds.”</p>
<p>That’s because you and your two hundred Wall Street lawyers were
nothing but functionaries for the Masters of the Universe, thought
Sherman, getting more annoyed by the second. He saw Campbell looking at
her grandfather in consternation.</p>
<p>“Your grandfather’s only joking, honey.” He shot his father a sharp
look. “A bond is a way of loaning people money. Let’s say you want to
build a road, and it’s not a little road but a big highway, like the
highway we took up to Maine last summer. Or you want to build a big
hospital. Well, that requires a lot of money, more money than you could
ever get by just going to a bank. So what you do is, you issue what are
called bonds.”</p>
<p>“You build roads and hospitals, Daddy? That’s what you do?”</p>
<p>Now both his father and his mother started laughing. He gave them
openly reproachful looks, which only made them merrier. Judy was smiling
with what appeared to be a sympathetic twinkle.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t actually build them, sweetheart. I handle the bonds, and
the bonds are what make it possible—”</p>
<p>“You help build them?”</p>
<p>“Well, in a way.”</p>
<p>“Which ones?”</p>
<p>“Which ones?”</p>
<p>“You said roads and hospitals.”</p>
<p>“Well, not any one specifically.”</p>
<p>“The road to Maine?”</p>
<p>Now both his father and mother were giggling the infuriating giggle
of people who are trying their best not to laugh right in your face.</p>
<p>“No, not the—”</p>
<p>“I think you’re in over your head, Sherman!” said his mother. Head
came close to soaring into a whoop.</p>
<p>“Not the road to Maine,” said Sherman, ignoring the comment. “Let me
try to put it another way.”</p>
<p>Judy broke in. “Let me try.”</p>
<p>“Well…all right.”</p>
<p>“Darling,” said Judy, “Daddy doesn’t build roads or hospitals, and he
doesn’t help build them, but he does handle the bonds for the people who
raise the money.”</p>
<p>“Bonds?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake, and you didn’t
bake the cake, but every time you hand somebody a slice of the cake a
tiny little bit comes off, like a little crumb, and you can keep
that.”</p>
<p>Judy was smiling, and so was Campbell, who seemed to realize that
this was a joke, a kind of fairy tale based on what her daddy did.</p>
<p>“Little crumbs?” she said encouragingly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Judy. “Or you have to imagine little crumbs, but a lot of
little crumbs. If you pass around enough slices of cake, then pretty
soon you have enough crumbs to make a gigantic cake.”</p>
<p>“For real life?” asked Campbell.</p>
<p>“No, not for real life. You just have to imagine that.” Judy looked
to Sherman’s father and mother for approval of this witty description of
the bond business. They smiled, but uncertainly.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure you’re making it any clearer for Campbell,” said
Sherman. “My goodness…crumbs.” He smiled to show he knew this was only
lunch-table banter. In fact…he was used to Judy’s supercilious attitude
toward Wall Street, but he was not happy about…crumbs.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s such a bad metaphor,” said Judy, also smiling.
Then she turned to his father. “Let me give you an actual example, John,
and you be the judge.”</p>
<p>John. Even though there was something…off…about crumbs, this was the
first real indication that things might be going over the edge. John.
His father and mother had encouraged Judy to call them John and Celeste,
but it made her uncomfortable. So she avoided calling them anything.
This casual, confident John was not like her. Even his father appeared a
bit on guard.</p>
<p>Judy launched into a description of his Giscard scheme. Then she said
to his father, “Pierce andandandand Pierce doesn’t issue them for the
French government and doesn’t buy them from the French government but
from whoever’s already bought them from the French government. So Pierce
andandandand Pierce’s transactions have nothing to do with anything
France hopes to build or develop or…achieve. It’s all been done long
before Pierce andandandand Pierce enters the picture. So they’re just
sort of…slices of cake. Golden cake. And Pierce andandandand Pierce
collects millions of marvelous”—she shrugged—“golden crumbs.”</p>
<p>“You can call them crumbs if you want,” said Sherman, trying not to
sound testy, and failing.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s the best I can do,” Judy said brightly. Then to his
father and mother: “Investment banking is an unusual field. I don’t know
if there is any way you can explain it to anyone under twenty. Or
perhaps under thirty.”</p>
<p>Sherman now noticed that Campbell was standing by with a distressed
look on her face. “Campbell,” he said, “you know what? I think Mommy
wants me to change professions.” He grinned, as if this were one of the
funniest discussions in years.</p>
<p>“Not at all,” said Judy, laughing. “I’m not complaining about your
golden crumbs!”</p>
<p>Crumbs—enough! He could feel his anger rising. But he kept on
smiling. “Perhaps I ought to try decorating. Excuse me, interior
designing.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you’re cut out for it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know. It must be fun getting pouffe curtains and
polished chintz for—who were those people?—those Italians you did that
apartment for?—the di Duccis?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that it’s fun particularly.”</p>
<p>“Well, then it’s creative. Right?”</p>
<p>“Well…at least you’re able to point to something you’ve done,
something tangible, something clear-cut—”</p>
<p>“For the di Duccis.”</p>
<p>“Even if it’s for people who are shallow and vain, it’s something
real, something describable, something contributing to simple human
satisfaction, no matter how meretricious and temporary, something you
can at least explain to your children. I mean, at Pierce andandandand
Pierce, what on earth do you tell each other you do every day?”</p>
<p>All at once, a wail. Campbell. Tears were coming down her face.
Sherman put his arms around her, but her body was rigid.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, sweetie!”</p>
<p>Judy got up and came over and put her arms around her, too. “Oh,
Campbell, Campbell, Campbell, sweetie pie! Daddy and I were only teasing
each other.”</p>
<p>Pollard Browning was looking their way. So was Rawlie. Faces at
tables all around, staring at the wounded child.</p>
<p>Because they were both trying to embrace Campbell, Sherman found his
face close to Judy’s. He wanted to strangle her. He glanced at his
parents. They were aghast.</p>
<p>His father stood up. “I’m going to get a martini,” he said. “You’re
all too up-to-date for me.”</p>
<p>Saturday! In SoHo! After a wait of less than twenty minutes, Larry
Kramer and his wife, Rhoda, and Greg Rosenwald and his live-in
girlfriend, Mary Lou Love-Greg, and Herman Rappaport and his wife,
Susan, now occupied a window table at the Haiphong Harbor restaurant.
Outside, on West Broadway, it was such a clear sparkling late-spring day
that not even the grime of SoHo could obscure it. Not even Kramer’s envy
of Greg Rosenwald could obscure it. He and Greg and Herman had been
classmates at New York University. They had worked on the Student
Activities Board together. Herman was now an editor, one among many, at
Putnam, the publishing house, and it was largely thanks to him that
Rhoda had gotten her job at Waverly Place Books. Kramer was an assistant
district attorney, one among 245, in the Bronx. But Greg, Greg with his
Downtown clothes on and the lovely Mary Lou Blonde at his side, was a
writer for The Village Voice. So far Greg was the only star that had
risen from their little group of campus hotshots. That had been apparent
from the moment they sat down. Any time the others had a comment to
make, they looked at Greg when they made it.</p>
<p>Herman was looking at Greg when he said, “Have you been in this place
Dean and DeLuca? Have you checked out the prices?
Smoked…Scottish…salmon…thirty-three dollars a pound? Susan and I were
just in there.”</p>
<p>Greg smiled knowingly. “That’s for the Short Hills Seville set.”</p>
<p>“The Short Hills Seville set?” asked Rhoda. My wife, the perfect
foil. Not only that, she had the kind of grin on her face that you put
on when you just know you’re going to get a witty reply.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Greg, “take a look out there.” Take a look oudeh. His
accent was as atrocious as Rhoda’s. “Every other car”—evvy udda kah—“is
a Cadillac Seville with Jersey license plates. And take a look at what
they wear.” Take a lookad whuddeh weh. Not only did he have an atrocious
accent, he had the 300-watt animation of David Brenner, the comedian.
“They roll out of these six-bedroom Georgians in Short Hills with their
bomber jackets and blue jeans, and they get in their Cadillac Sevilles
and they drive to SoHo every Saturday.”</p>
<p>Evvy Saddy. But Rhoda and Herman and Susan beamed and chuckled in
appreciation. They thought this was rich stuff. Only Mary Lou Blonde
Headlights looked less than swept away by this priceless urbanity.
Kramer decided that if he got a word in edgewise, he would direct it
toward her.</p>
<p>Greg was off on a disquisition on all the bourgeois elements who were
now attracted to the artists’ quarter. Why didn’t he start with himself?
Look at him. A wavy red beard as big as the King of Hearts’s hiding his
receding chin…a blackish-green tweed jacket with enormous shoulders and
lapels with notches down around his ribs…a black T-shirt with the logo
of the Pus Casserole, the band, across the chest…black pegged pants…the
Greasy Black look that was so…so Post-Punk, so Downtown, so…of the
moment…And in fact he was a nice little Jewish boy from Riverdale, which
was the Short Hills of the New York City limits, and his parents had a
nice big Colonial house, or Tudor, or whatever it was…A middle-class
twerp…a writer for The Village Voice, a know-it-all, possessor of Mary
Lou Downy Shanks…Greg had started living with Mary Lou when she enrolled
in the Investigative Journalism seminar he was teaching at N.Y.U. two
years ago. She had a fantastic body, outstanding breasts, and classic
Wasp looks. She stood out on the N.Y.U. campus like somebody from
another planet. Kramer called her Mary Lou Love-Greg, which was a way of
saying she had given up her actual identity to live with Greg. She
bothered them. She bothered Kramer most of all. He found her dense,
distant—intensely desirable. She reminded him of the girl with brown
lipstick. And for this he envied Greg most of all. He had taken this
gorgeous creature and possessed her, without assuming any obligations,
without getting stuck in an ant colony on the West Side, without having
an English nanny sitting on his neck, without having a wife he had to
watch turning into her shtetl mama…Kramer cut a look at Rhoda and her
beaming puffy face and immediately felt guilty. He loved his new son, he
was bound to Rhoda, forever, in a sacred way…and yet…This is New York!
And I’m young!</p>
<p>Greg’s words flowed past him. His eyes wandered. For a moment they
met Mary Lou’s. She held them. Could it be—But he couldn’t look at her
forever. He looked out the window at the people walking along West
Broadway. Most were young or youngish—so smartly turned out!—so
Downtown!—sparkling, even in Greasy Black, on a perfect Saturday in late
spring.</p>
<p>Then and there, sitting at a table in the Haiphong Harbor, Kramer
vowed that he would be part of it. The girl with brown lipstick—</p>
<p>—had held his eyes, and he had held hers, when the verdict came. He
had won. He had carried the jury and sunk Herbert, who would get a
sentence of three to six, at the very least, since he already had a
felony conviction on his record. He had been tough, fearless, shrewd—and
he had won. He had won her. When the foreman, a black man named
Forester, had announced the verdict, he had looked into her eyes and she
had looked into his, and they had stayed that way for what seemed like a
very long time. There was no question about it.</p>
<p>Kramer tried to catch Mary Lou’s eyes again but missed. Rhoda was
looking at the menu. He heard her ask Susan Rappaport, “Jeet foya came
down heh?” Which meant, “Did you eat before you came down here?”</p>
<p>Susan said, “No, ju?” No, did you?</p>
<p>“No, I couldn’t waida get oudada house. I won’t be able a do’is again
for sixteen years.”</p>
<p>“Do what?”</p>
<p>“Oh, just go to SoHo because I feel like going to SoHo. Go anywhere.
The baby nurse is leaving on Wednesday.”</p>
<p>“Whyn’t you get somebody else?”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding? You wanna know how much we’re paying her?”</p>
<p>“How much?”</p>
<p>“Five hundred and twenty-five dollars a week. My mother’s been paying
for it, for four weeks.”</p>
<p>Thanks a lot. Go ahead. Tell all these yentas your husband can’t even
afford the goddamned baby nurse. He noticed that Susan’s eyes left
Rhoda’s face and looked up. On the sidewalk, just on the other side of
the plate glass, stood a young man trying to peer in. If it hadn’t been
for the quarter inch of plate glass, he would have been leaning right
across their table. He kept peering, peering, peering, until the tip of
his nose was almost pressed against the glass. Now all six of them were
looking at the fellow, but he apparently couldn’t see them. He had a
lean, lineless, fair young face and soft curly light brown hair. In his
open-neck shirt, with the collar of his navy warm-up jacket turned up,
he looked like a young aviator from long ago.</p>
<p>Mary Lou Caress turned toward Susan with a mischievous look on her
face. “I think we ought to ask him if he’s had lunch.”</p>
<p>“Ummmmm,” said Susan, who, like Rhoda, had already laid on her first
subcutaneous layer of Matron.</p>
<p>“He looks hungry to me,” said Mary Lou.</p>
<p>“Looks retarded to me,” said Greg. Greg was scarcely a foot away from
the young man, and the contrast between Greg’s unhealthy Greasy Black
Downtown hip weasel appearance and the young man’s rosy good looks was
overwhelming. Kramer wondered if the others noticed. Mary Lou must have
noticed. This red-bearded Riverdale twerp didn’t deserve her.</p>
<p>Kramer caught her eye again for a moment, but she watched the young
man, who, baffled by the reflections, now turned away from the window
and began walking up West Broadway. On the back of his jacket was
embroidered a golden thunderbolt and, above it, the words RADARTRONIC
SECURITY.</p>
<p>“Radartronic Security,” said Greg in a way that indicated what a
cipher, a nullity, was this character Mary Lou had decided to go gaga
over.</p>
<p>“You can be sure he doesn’t work for any security company,” said
Kramer. He was determined to capture Mary Lou’s attention.</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Greg.</p>
<p>“Because I happen to know who does. I see them every day. I wouldn’t
hire a security guard in this city if my life depended on it—especially
if my life depended on it. They’re all predicate violent felons.”</p>
<p>“They’re what?” asked Mary Lou.</p>
<p>“Predicate violent felons. They already have at least one conviction
for a felony involving violence against a person.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on,” said Herman. “That can’t be true.” He had their
attention now. He was playing his one strong suit, Macho Insider from
the Bronx.</p>
<p>“Well, not all, but I bet 60 percent. You ought to sit in on the
pleabargaining sessions some morning up on the Grand Concourse. One of
the ways you justify a plea bargain is, the judge asks the defendant if
he has a job, and if he does, that’s supposed to show he has roots in
the community, and so on. So the judge’ll ask these kids if they have a
job, and I mean these kids are being held for armed robbery, muggings,
assaults, manslaughter, attempted murder, you name it, and every one of
them, if they have any job at all, they’ll say, ‘Yeah, security guard.’
I mean, who do you think takes these jobs? They pay minimum wage,
they’re boring, and when they’re not boring, they’re unpleasant.”</p>
<p>“Maybe they’re good at it,” said Greg. “They like to mix it up. They
know how to handle weapons.”</p>
<p>Rhoda and Susan laughed. Such a wit, such a wit.</p>
<p>Mary Lou didn’t laugh. She kept looking at Kramer.</p>
<p>“No doubt they do,” he said. He didn’t want to lose control of the
conversation and those big-breasted blue eyes. “Everybody in the Bronx
carries weapons. Let me tell you about a case I just finished.”
Ahhhhhhh! This was his chance to tell about the triumph of the People
over that desperado Herbert 92X, and he plunged into the story with
relish. But from the first Greg caused problems. As soon as he heard the
name Herbert 92X, he butted in with some story he had done on prisons
for The Village Voice.</p>
<p>“If it weren’t for the Muslims, the prisons in this city would really
be out of control.”</p>
<p>That was bullshit, but Kramer didn’t want the discussion to get onto
the Muslims and Greg’s goddamned story. So he said, “Herbert’s not
really a Muslim. I mean, Muslims don’t go to bars.”</p>
<p>It was slow going. Greg knew it all. He knew all about Muslims,
prisons, crime, street life in the billion-footed city. He began to turn
the story against Kramer. Why were they so anxious to prosecute a man
who had done nothing but follow the natural instinct to protect your own
life?</p>
<p>“But he killed a man, Greg!—with an unlicensed gun that he carried
every day, as a routine thing.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but look at the job he had! It’s obviously a dangerous
occupation. You said yourself everybody carries weapons up there.”</p>
<p>“Look at his job? Okay, let’s look at it. He works for a goddamned
bootlegger!”</p>
<p>“Whaddaya want him to do, work for IBM?”</p>
<p>“You talk like that’s out of the question. I bet IBM has plenty of
programs for minorities, but Herbert wouldn’t want one a their jobs if
they gave it to him. Herbert is a player. He’s a hustler who tries to
cover himself with this religious mantle, and he just goes on being
childish, egocentric, irresponsible, shiftless—”</p>
<p>Suddenly it dawned on Kramer that they were all looking at him in a
funny way, all of them. Rhoda…Mary Lou…They were giving him the look you
give someone who turns out to be a covert reactionary. He was too far
gone in this criminal-justice scam…He was humming with the System’s
reactionary overtones…This was like one of the bull sessions the gang
used to have when they were all back at N.Y.U., except that now they
were in their early thirties and they were looking at him as if he had
become something awful. And he knew in an instant there was no way he
could explain to them what he had seen over the past six years. They
wouldn’t understand, least of all Greg, who was taking his triumph over
Herbert 92X and stuffing it down his throat.</p>
<p>It was going so badly that Rhoda felt compelled to come to the
rescue.</p>
<p>“You don’t understand, Greg,” she said. “You have no idea, the
caseload Larry has. There are seven thousand criminal indictments every
year in the Bronx, and they only have the capacity”—the kehpehsity—“for
five hundred trials. There’s no way they can study every aspect of every
case and take all these different things into consideration.”</p>
<p>“I can just imagine somebody trying to tell that to this fellow
Herbert 92X.”</p>
<p>Kramer looked up at the ceiling of the Haiphong Harbor. It had been
painted matte black, along with all sorts of ducts, pipes, and lighting
fixtures. Looked like intestines. His own wife. Her idea of coming to
his defense was to say, “Larry’s got so many colored people to put away,
he hasn’t got time to treat them as individuals. So you mustn’t be hard
on him.” He had broken his hump on the Herbert 92X case, handled it
brilliantly, looked Herbert himself right in the eye, avenged the father
of five, Nestor Cabrillo—and what did he get for it? Now he had to
defend himself against a bunch of intellectual trendies in a trendy
bistro in trendy fucking SoHo.</p>
<p>He scanned the table. Even Mary Lou was giving him the fishy look.
The big beautiful whitebread airhead had become as trendy as the rest of
them.</p>
<p>Well, there was one person who understood the Herbert 92X case, who
understood how brilliant he had been, who understood the righteousness
of the justice he had wrought, and she made Mary Lou Jugs look
like…like…nothing.</p>
<p>For a moment he caught Mary Lou’s eyes again, but the light had gone
out.</p>
