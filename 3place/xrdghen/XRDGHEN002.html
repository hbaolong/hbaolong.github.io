<h4 id="the-master-of-the-universe">1. The Master of the Universe</h4>
<p>At that very moment, in the very sort of Park Avenue co-op apartment
that so obsessed the Mayor…twelve-foot ceilings…two wings, one for the
white Anglo-Saxon Protestants who own the place and one for the
help…Sherman McCoy was kneeling in his front hall trying to put a leash
on a dachshund. The floor was a deep green marble, and it went on and
on. It led to a five-foot-wide walnut staircase that swept up in a
sumptuous curve to the floor above. It was the sort of apartment the
mere thought of which ignites flames of greed and covetousness under
people all over New York and, for that matter, all over the world. But
Sherman burned only with the urge to get out of this fabulous spread of
his for thirty minutes.</p>
<p>So here he was, down on both knees, struggling with a dog. The
dachshund, he figured, was his exit visa.</p>
<p>Looking at Sherman McCoy, hunched over like that and dressed the way
he was, in his checked shirt, khaki pants, and leather boating
moccasins, you would have never guessed what an imposing figure he
usually cut. Still young…thirty-eight years old…tall…almost
six-one…terrific posture…terrific to the point of imperious…as imperious
as his daddy, the Lion of Dunning Sponget…a full head of sandy-brown
hair…a long nose…a prominent chin…He was proud of his chin. The McCoy
chin; the Lion had it, too. It was a manly chin, a big round chin such
as Yale men used to have in those drawings by Gibson and Leyendecker, an
aristocratic chin, if you want to know what Sherman thought. He was a
Yale man himself.</p>
<p>But at this moment his entire appearance was supposed to say: “I’m
only going out to walk the dog.”</p>
<p>The dachshund seemed to know what was ahead. He kept ducking away
from the leash. The beast’s stunted legs were deceiving. If you tried to
lay hands on him, he turned into a two-foot tube packed with muscle. In
grappling with him, Sherman had to lunge. And when he lunged, his
kneecap hit the marble floor, and the pain made him angry.</p>
<p>“C’mon, Marshall,” he kept muttering. “Hold still, damn it.”</p>
<p>The beast ducked again, and he hurt his knee again, and now he
resented not only the beast but his wife, too. It was his wife’s
delusions of a career as an interior decorator that had led to this
ostentatious spread of marble in the first place. The tiny black
grosgrain cap on the toe of a woman’s shoe—</p>
<p>—she was standing there.</p>
<p>“You’re having a time, Sherman. What on earth are you doing?”</p>
<p>Without looking up: “I’m taking Marshall for a wa-a-a-a-a-alk.”</p>
<p>Walk came out as a groan, because the dachshund attempted a fishtail
maneuver and Sherman had to wrap his arm around the dog’s
midsection.</p>
<p>“Did you know it was raining?”</p>
<p>Still not looking up: “Yes, I know.” Finally he managed to snap the
leash on the animal’s collar.</p>
<p>“You’re certainly being nice to Marshall all of a sudden.”</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Was this irony? Did she suspect something? He looked
up.</p>
<p>But the smile on her face was obviously genuine, altogether
pleasant…a lovely smile, in fact…Still a very good-looking woman, my
wife…with her fine thin features, her big clear blue eyes, her rich
brown hair…But she’s forty years old!…No getting around it…Today
good-looking…Tomorrow they’ll be talking about what a handsome woman she
is…Not her fault…But not mine, either!</p>
<p>“I have an idea,” she said. “Why don’t you let me walk Marshall? Or
I’ll get Eddie to do it. You go upstairs and read Campbell a story
before she goes to sleep. She’d love it. You’re not home this early very
often. Why don’t you do that?”</p>
<p>He stared at her. It wasn’t a trick! She was sincere! And yet zip zip
zip zip zip zip zip with a few swift strokes, a few little sentences,
she had…tied him in knots!—thongs of guilt and logic! Without even
trying!</p>
<p>The fact that Campbell might be lying in her little bed—my only
child!—the utter innocence of a six-year-old!—wishing that he would read
her a bedtime story…while he was…doing whatever it was he was now
doing…Guilt!…The fact that he usually got home too late to see her at
all…Guilt on top of guilt!…He doted on Campbell!—loved her more than
anything in the world!…To make matters worse—the logic of it! The sweet
wifely face he was now staring at had just made a considerate and
thoughtful suggestion, a logical suggestion…so logical he was
speechless! There weren’t enough white lies in the world to get around
such logic! And she was only trying to be nice!</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” she said. “Campbell will be so pleased. I’ll tend to
Marshall.”</p>
<p>The world was upside down. What was he, a Master of the Universe,
doing down here on the floor, reduced to ransacking his brain for white
lies to circumvent the sweet logic of his wife? The Masters of the
Universe were a set of lurid, rapacious plastic dolls that his otherwise
perfect daughter liked to play with. They looked like Norse gods who
lifted weights, and they had names such as Dracon, Ahor, Mangelred, and
Blutong. They were unusually vulgar, even for plastic toys. Yet one fine
day, in a fit of euphoria, after he had picked up the telephone and
taken an order for zero-coupon bonds that had brought him a 0,000
commission, just like that, this very phrase had bubbled up into his
brain. On Wall Street he and a few others—how many?—three hundred, four
hundred, five hundred?—had become precisely that…Masters of the
Universe. There was…no limit whatsoever! Naturally he had never so much
as whispered this phrase to a living soul. He was no fool. Yet he
couldn’t get it out of his head. And here was the Master of the
Universe, on the floor with a dog, hog-tied by sweetness, guilt, and
logic…Why couldn’t he (being a Master of the Universe) simply explain it
to her? Look, Judy, I still love you and I love our daughter and I love
our home and I love our life, and I don’t want to change any of it—it’s
just that I, a Master of the Universe, a young man still in the season
of the rising sap, deserve more from time to time, when the spirit moves
me—</p>
<p>—but he knew he could never put any such thought into words. So
resentment began to bubble up into his brain…In a way she brought it on
herself, didn’t she…Those women whose company she now seems to
prize…those…those…The phrase pops into his head at that very instant:
social X-rays…They keep themselves so thin, they look like X-ray
pictures…You can see lamplight through their bones…while they’re
chattering about interiors and landscape gardening…and encasing their
scrawny shanks in metallic Lycra tubular tights for their Sports
Training classes…And it hasn’t helped any, has it!…See how drawn her
face and neck look…He concentrated on her face and neck…drawn…No doubt
about it…Sports Training…turning into one of them—</p>
<p>He managed to manufacture just enough resentment to ignite the famous
McCoy temper.</p>
<p>He could feel his face grow hot. He put his head down and said,
“Juuuuuudy…” It was a shout stifled by teeth. He pressed the thumb and
the first two fingers of his left hand together and held them in front
of his clamped jaws and blazing eyes, and he said:</p>
<p>“Look…I’m all—set—to—walk—the—dog…So
I’m—going—out—to—walk—the—dog…Okay?”</p>
<p>Halfway through it, he knew it was totally out of proportion
to…to…but he couldn’t hold back. That, after all, was the secret of the
McCoy temper…on Wall Street…wherever…the imperious excess.</p>
<p>Judy’s lips tightened. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Please do what you want,” she said tonelessly. Then she turned away
and walked across the marble hall and ascended the sumptuous stairs.</p>
<p>Still on his knees, he looked at her, but she didn’t look back.
Please do what you want. He had run right over her. Nothing to it. But
it was a hollow victory.</p>
<p>Another spasm of guilt—</p>
<p>The Master of the Universe stood up and managed to hold on to the
leash and struggle into his raincoat. It was a worn but formidable
rubberized British riding mac, full of flaps, straps, and buckles. He
had bought it at Knoud on Madison Avenue. Once, he had considered its
aged look as just the thing, after the fashion of the Boston Cracked
Shoe look. Now he wondered. He yanked the dachshund along on the leash
and went from the entry gallery out into the elevator vestibule and
pushed the button.</p>
<p>Rather than continue to pay around-the-clock shifts of Irishmen from
Queens and Puerto Ricans from the Bronx 00,000 a year to run the
elevators, the apartment owners had decided two years ago to convert the
elevators to automatic. Tonight that suited Sherman fine. In this
outfit, with this squirming dog in tow, he didn’t feel like standing in
an elevator with an elevator man dressed up like an 1870 Austrian army
colonel. The elevator descended—and came to a stop two floors below.
Browning. The door opened, and the smooth-jowled bulk of Pollard
Browning stepped on. Browning looked Sherman and his country outfit and
the dog up and down and said, without a trace of a smile, “Hello,
Sherman.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Sherman” was on the end of a ten-foot pole and in a mere four
syllables conveyed the message: “You and your clothes and your animal
are letting down our new mahogany-paneled elevator.”</p>
<p>Sherman was furious but nevertheless found himself leaning over and
picking the dog up off the floor. Browning was the president of the
building’s co-op board. He was a New York boy who had emerged from his
mother’s loins as a fifty-year-old partner in Davis Polk and president
of the Downtown Association. He was only forty but had looked fifty for
the past twenty years. His hair was combed back smoothly over his round
skull. He wore an immaculate navy suit, a white shirt, a shepherd’s
check necktie, and no raincoat. He faced the elevator door, then turned
his head, took another look at Sherman, said nothing, and turned
back.</p>
<p>Sherman had known him ever since they were boys at the Buckley
School. Browning had been a fat, hearty, overbearing junior snob who at
the age of nine knew how to get across the astonishing news that McCoy
was a hick name (and a hick family), as in Hatfields and McCoys, whereas
he, Browning, was a true Knickerbocker. He used to call Sherman “Sherman
McCoy the Mountain Boy.”</p>
<p>When they reached the ground floor, Browning said, “You know it’s
raining, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Browning looked at the dachshund and shook his head. “Sherman McCoy.
Friend to man’s best friend.”</p>
<p>Sherman felt his face getting hot again. He said, “That’s it?”</p>
<p>“What’s it?”</p>
<p>“You had from the eighth floor to here to think up something bright,
and that’s it?” It was supposed to sound like amiable sarcasm, but he
knew his anger had slipped out around the edges.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Browning, and he
walked on ahead. The doorman smiled and nodded and held the door open
for him. Browning walked out under the awning to his car. His chauffeur
held the car door open for him. Not a drop of rain touched his glossy
form, and he was off, smoothly, immaculately, into the swarm of red
taillights heading down Park Avenue. No ratty riding mac encumbered the
sleek fat back of Pollard Browning.</p>
<p>In fact, it was raining only lightly, and there was no wind, but the
dachshund was having none of it. He was beginning to struggle in
Sherman’s arms. The power of the little bastard! He put the dog down on
the runner under the awning and then stepped out into the rain with the
leash. In the darkness the apartment buildings on the other side of the
avenue were a serene black wall holding back the city’s sky, which was a
steaming purple. It glowed, as if inflamed by a fever.</p>
<p>Hell, it wasn’t so bad out here. Sherman pulled, but the dog dug into
the runner with his toenails.</p>
<p>“Come on, Marshall.”</p>
<p>The doorman was standing outside the door, watching him.</p>
<p>“I don’t think he’s too happy about it, Mr. McCoy.”</p>
<p>“I’m not, either, Eddie.” And never mind the commentary, thought
Sherman. “C’mon, c’mon, c’mon, Marshall.”</p>
<p>By now Sherman was out in the rain giving the leash a pretty good
pull, but the dachshund wasn’t budging. So he picked him up and took him
off the rubber runner and set him down on the sidewalk. The dog tried to
bolt for the door. Sherman couldn’t give him any more slack on the leash
or else he was going to be right back where he started. So now he was
leaning one way and the dog was leaning the other, with the leash taut
between them. It was a tug-of-war between a man and a dog…on Park
Avenue. Why the hell didn’t the doorman get back in the building where
he belonged?</p>
<p>Sherman gave the leash a real jerk. The dachshund skidded forward a
few inches on the sidewalk. You could hear his toenails scraping. Well,
maybe if he dragged him hard enough, he would give up and start walking
just to keep from being dragged.</p>
<p>“C’mon, Marshall! We’re only going around the corner!”</p>
<p>He gave the leash another jerk and then kept pulling for all he was
worth. The dog slid forward a couple of feet. He slid! He wouldn’t walk.
He wouldn’t give up. The beast’s center of gravity seemed to be at the
middle of the earth. It was like trying to drag a sled with a pile of
bricks on it. Christ, if he could only get around the corner. That was
all he wanted. Why was it that the simplest things—he gave the leash
another jerk and then he kept the pressure on. He was leaning like a
sailor into the wind. He was getting hot inside his rubberized riding
mac. The rain was running down his face. The dachshund had his feet
splayed out on the sidewalk. His shoulder muscles were bulging. He was
thrashing from side to side. His neck was stretched out. Thank God, he
wasn’t barking, at least! He slid. Christ, you could hear it! You could
hear his toenails scraping along the sidewalk. He wouldn’t give an inch.
Sherman had his head down, his shoulders hunched over, dragging this
animal through the darkness and the rain on Park Avenue. He could feel
the rain on the back of his neck.</p>
<p>He squatted down and picked up the dachshund, catching a glimpse of
Eddie, the doorman, as he did. Still watching! The dog began bucking and
thrashing. Sherman stumbled. He looked down. The leash had gotten
wrapped around his legs. He began gimping along the sidewalk. Finally he
made it around the corner to the pay telephone. He put the dog down on
the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Christ! Almost got away! He grabs the leash just in time. He’s
sweating. His head is soaked with rain. His heart is pounding. He sticks
one arm through the loop in the leash. The dog keeps struggling. The
leash is wrapped around Sherman’s legs again. He picks up the telephone
and cradles it between his shoulder and his ear and fishes around in his
pocket for a quarter and drops it in the slot and dials.</p>
<p>Three rings, and a woman’s voice: “Hello?”</p>
<p>But it was not Maria’s voice. He figured it must be her friend
Germaine, the one she sublet the apartment from. So he said: “May I
speak to Maria, please?”</p>
<p>The woman said: “Sherman? Is that you?”</p>
<p>Christ! It’s Judy! He’s dialed his own apartment! He’s
aghast—paralyzed!</p>
<p>“Sherman?”</p>
<p>He hangs up. Oh Jesus. What can he do? He’ll bluff it out. When she
asks him, he’ll say he doesn’t know what she’s talking about. After all,
he said only five or six words. How can she be sure?</p>
<p>But it was no use. She’d be sure, all right. Besides, he was no good
at bluffing. She’d see right through him. Still, what else could he
do?</p>
<p>He stood there in the rain, in the dark, by the telephone. The water
had worked its way down inside his shirt collar. He was breathing
heavily. He was trying to figure out how bad it was going to be. What
would she do? What would she say? How angry would she be? This time
she’d have something she could really work on. She deserved her scene if
she wanted it. He had been truly stupid. How could he have done such a
thing? He berated himself. He was no longer angry at Judy at all. Could
he bluff it out, or had he really done it now? Had he really hurt
her?</p>
<p>All at once Sherman was aware of a figure approaching him on the
sidewalk, in the wet black shadows of the town houses and the trees.
Even from fifty feet away, in the darkness, he could tell. It was that
deep worry that lives in the base of the skull of every resident of Park
Avenue south of Ninety-sixth Street—a black youth, tall, rangy, wearing
white sneakers. Now he was forty feet away, thirty-five. Sherman stared
at him. Well, let him come! I’m not budging! It’s my territory! I’m not
giving way for any street punks!</p>
<p>The black youth suddenly made a ninety-degree turn and cut straight
across the street to the sidewalk on the other side. The feeble yellow
of a sodium-vapor streetlight reflected for an instant on his face as he
checked Sherman out.</p>
<p>He had crossed over! What a stroke of luck!</p>
<p>Not once did it dawn on Sherman McCoy that what the boy had seen was
a thirty-eight-year-old white man, soaking wet, dressed in some sort of
military-looking raincoat full of straps and buckles, holding a
violently lurching animal in his arms, staring, bug-eyed, and talking to
himself.</p>
<p>Sherman stood by the telephone, breathing rapidly, almost panting.
What was he to do now? He felt so defeated, he might as well go back
home. But if he went back immediately, it would be pretty obvious,
wouldn’t it? He hadn’t gone out to walk the dog but to make a telephone
call. Besides, whatever Judy was going to say, he wasn’t ready for it.
He needed to think. He needed advice. He needed to get this intractable
beast out of the rain.</p>
<p>So he dug out another quarter and summoned up Maria’s number into his
brain. He concentrated on it. He nailed it down. Then he dialed it with
a plodding deliberation, as if he were using this particular invention,
the telephone, for the first time.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Maria?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Taking no chances: “It’s me.”</p>
<p>“Sherman?” It came out Shuhhh-mun. Sherman was reassured. That was
Maria, all right. She had the variety of Southern accent in which half
the vowels are pronounced like u’s and the other half like short i’s.
Birds were buds, pens were pins, bombs were bums, and envelopes were
invilups.</p>
<p>“Listen,” he said, “I’ll be right over. I’m at a telephone booth. I’m
only a couple of blocks away.”</p>
<p>There was a pause, which he took to mean she was irritated. Finally:
“Where on earth have you been?” Where un uth have you bin?</p>
<p>Sherman laughed morosely. “Look, I’ll be right over.”</p>
<p>The staircase of the town house sagged and groaned as Sherman walked
up. On each floor a single bare 22-watt circular fluorescent tube, known
as the Landlord’s Halo, radiated a feeble tubercular-blue glow upon the
walls, which were Rental Unit Green. Sherman passed apartment doors with
innumerable locks, one above the other in drunken columns. There were
anti-pliers covers over the locks and anti-jimmy irons over the jambs
and anti-push-in screens over the door panels.</p>
<p>In blithe moments, when King Priapus reigned, with no crises in his
domain, Sherman made this climb up to Maria’s with a romantic relish.
How bohemian! How…real this place was! How absolutely right for these
moments when the Master of the Universe stripped away the long-faced
proprieties of Park Avenue and Wall Street and let his rogue hormones
out for a romp! Maria’s one room, with its closet for a kitchen and
another closet for a bathroom, this so-called apartment of hers, fourth
floor rear, which she sublet from her friend Germaine—well, it was
perfect. Germaine was something else again. Sherman had met her twice.
She was built like a fire hydrant. She had a ferocious hedge of hair on
her upper lip, practically a mustache. Sherman was convinced she was a
lesbian. But so what? It was all real! Squalid! New York! A rush of fire
in the loins!</p>
<p>But tonight Priapus did not rule. Tonight the grimness of the old
brownstone weighed on the Master of the Universe.</p>
<p>Only the dachshund was happy. He was hauling his belly up the stairs
at a merry clip. It was warm and dry in here, and familiar.</p>
<p>When Sherman reached Maria’s door, he was surprised to find himself
out of breath. He was perspiring. His body was positively abloom beneath
the riding mac, his checked shirt, and his T-shirt.</p>
<p>Before he could knock on the door, it opened about a foot, and there
she was. She didn’t open it any farther. She stood there, looking
Sherman up and down, as if she were angry. Her eyes gleamed above those
remarkable high cheekbones of hers. Her bobbed hair was like a black
hood. Her lips were drawn up into an O. All at once she broke into a
smile and began chuckling with little sniffs through her nose.</p>
<p>“Well, come on,” said Sherman, “let me in! Wait’ll I tell you what
happened.”</p>
<p>Now Maria pushed the door all the way open, but instead of ushering
him inside, she leaned up against the doorjamb and crossed her legs and
folded her arms underneath her breasts and kept staring at him and
chuckling. She was wearing high-heeled pumps with a black-and-white
checkerboard pattern worked into the leather. Sherman knew little about
shoe designs, but it registered on him that this one was of the moment.
She wore a tailored white gabardine skirt, very short, a good four
inches above the knees, revealing her legs, which to Sherman’s eyes were
like a dancer’s, and emphasizing her tiny waist. She wore a white silk
blouse, open down to the top of her breasts. The light in the tiny
entryway was such that it threw her entire ensemble into high relief:
her dark hair, those cheekbones, the fine features of her face, the
swollen curve of her lips, her creamy blouse, those creamy flan breasts,
her shimmering shanks, so insouciantly crossed.</p>
<p>“Sherman…” Shuhhh-mun. “You know what? You’re cute. You’re just like
my little brother.”</p>
<p>The Master of the Universe was mildly annoyed, but he walked on in,
passing her and saying: “Oh boy. Wait’ll I tell you what happened.”</p>
<p>Without altering her pose in the doorway, Maria looked down at the
dog, who was sniffing at the carpet. “Hello, Marshall!” Muhshull.
“You’re a wet little piece a salami, Marshall.”</p>
<p>“Wait’ll I tell you—”</p>
<p>Maria started to laugh and then shut the door. “Sherman…you look like
somebody just…balled you up”—she balled up an imaginary piece of
paper—“and threw you down.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I feel like. Let me tell you what happened.”</p>
<p>“Just like my little brother. Every day he came home from school, and
his belly button was showing.”</p>
<p>Sherman looked down. It was true. His checked shirt was pulled out of
his pants, and his belly button was showing. He shoved the shirt back
in, but he didn’t take off the riding mac. He couldn’t settle in here.
He couldn’t stay too long. He didn’t know quite how to get that across
to Maria.</p>
<p>“Every day my little brother got in a fight at school…”</p>
<p>Sherman stopped listening. He was tired of Maria’s little brother,
not so much because the thrust of it was that he, Sherman, was childish,
but because she insisted on going on about it. At first glance, Maria
had never struck Sherman as anybody’s idea of a Southern girl. She
looked Italian or Greek. But she talked like a Southern girl. The
chatter just poured out. She was still talking when Sherman said:</p>
<p>“You know, I just called you from a telephone booth. You want to know
what happened?”</p>
<p>Maria turned her back and walked out into the middle of the
apartment, then wheeled about and struck a pose, with her head cocked to
one side and her hands on her hips and one high-heeled foot slewed out
in a carefree manner and her shoulders thrown back and her back slightly
arched, pushing her breasts forward, and she said:</p>
<p>“Do you see anything new?”</p>
<p>What the hell was she talking about? Sherman wasn’t in a mood for
anything new. But he looked her over dutifully. Did she have a new
hairdo? A new piece of jewelry? Christ, her husband loaded her with so
much jewelry, who could keep track? No, it must be something in the
room. His eyes jumped around. It had probably been built as a child’s
bedroom a hundred years ago. There was a little bay with three leaded
casement windows and a window seat all the way around. He surveyed the
furniture…the same old three bentwood chairs, the same old ungainly oak
pedestal table, the same old mattress-and-box-spring set with a corduroy
cover and three or four paisley cushions strewn on top in an attempt to
make it look like a divan. The whole place shrieked: Make Do. In any
event, it hadn’t changed.</p>
<p>Sherman shook his head.</p>
<p>“You really don’t?” Maria motioned with her head in the direction of
the bed.</p>
<p>Sherman now noticed, over the bed, a small painting with a simple
frame of blond wood. He took a couple of steps closer. It was a picture
of a nude man, seen from the rear, outlined in crude black brushstrokes,
the way an eight-year-old might do it, assuming an eight-year-old had a
notion to paint a nude man. The man appeared to be taking a shower, or
at least there was what looked like a nozzle over his head, and some
slapdash black lines were coming out of the nozzle. He seemed to be
taking a shower in fuel oil. The man’s flesh was tan with sickly
lavender-pink smears on it, as if he were a burn case. What a piece of
garbage…It was sick…But it gave off the sanctified odor of serious art,
and so Sherman hesitated to be candid.</p>
<p>“Where’d you get that?”</p>
<p>“You like it? You know his work?”</p>
<p>“Whose work?”</p>
<p>“Filippo Chirazzi.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t know his work.”</p>
<p>She was smiling. “There was a whole article about him, in the
Times.”</p>
<p>Not wanting to play the Wall Street philistine, Sherman resumed his
study of this masterpiece.</p>
<p>“Well, it has a certain…how can I say it?…directness.” He fought the
urge to be ironic. “Where did you get it?”</p>
<p>“Filippo gave it to me.” Very cheery.</p>
<p>“That was generous.”</p>
<p>“Arthur’s bought four of his paintings, great big ones.”</p>
<p>“But he didn’t give it to Arthur, he gave it to you.”</p>
<p>“I wanted one for myself. The big ones are Arthur’s. Besides, Arthur
wouldn’t know Filippo from…from I don’t know what, if I hadn’t told
him.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“You don’t like it, do you.”</p>
<p>“I like it. To tell you the truth, I’m rattled. I just did something
so goddamned stupid.”</p>
<p>Maria gave up her pose and sat down on the edge of the bed, the
would-be divan, as if to say, “Okay, I’m ready to listen.” She crossed
her legs. Her skirt was now halfway up her thighs. Even though those
legs, those exquisite shanks and flanks of hers, were beside the point
right now, Sherman couldn’t keep his eyes off them. Her stockings made
them shiny. They glistened. Every time she moved, the highlights
shimmered.</p>
<p>Sherman remained standing. He didn’t have much time, as he was about
to explain.</p>
<p>“I took Marshall out for a walk.” Marshall was now stretched out on
the rug. “And it’s raining. And he starts giving me a very hard
time.”</p>
<p>When he got to the part about the telephone call itself, he became
highly agitated even in the description of it. He noticed that Maria was
containing her concern, if any, quite successfully, but he couldn’t calm
down. He plunged on into the emotional heart of the matter, the things
he felt immediately after he hung up—and Maria cut him off with a shrug
and a little flick in the air with the back of her hand.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s nothing, Sherman.” That’s nuthun, Shuhmun.</p>
<p>He stared at her.</p>
<p>“All you did was make a telephone call. I don’t know why you just
didn’t say, ‘Oh, I’m sorry. I was calling my friend Maria Ruskin.’
That’s what I woulda done. I never bother lying to Arthur. I don’t tell
him every little thing, but I don’t lie to him.”</p>
<p>Could he possibly have used such a brazen strategy? He ran it through
his mind. “Uhmmmmmmmm.” It ended up as a groan. “I don’t know how I can
go out at 9:30 at night and say I’m walking the dog and then call up and
say, ‘Oh, I’m sorry, I’m really out here calling Maria Ruskin.’”</p>
<p>“You know the difference between you and me, Sherman? You feel sorry
for your wife, and I don’t feel sorry for Arthur. Arthur’s gonna be
seventy-two in August. He knew I had my own friends when he married me,
and he knew he didn’t like them, and he had his own friends, and he knew
I didn’t like them. I can’t stand them. All those old Yids…Don’t look at
me as if I’ve said something awful! That’s the way Arthur talks. ‘The
Yiddim.’ And the goyim, and I’m a shiksa. I never heard of all that
stuff before I met Arthur. I’m the one who happens to be married to a
Jew, not you, and I’ve had to swallow enough of this Jewish business
over the past five years to be able to use a little of it if I feel like
it.”</p>
<p>“Have you told him you have your own apartment here?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I told you, I don’t lie to him, but I don’t tell him
every little thing.”</p>
<p>“Is this a little thing?”</p>
<p>“It’s not as big a thing as you think it is. It’s a pain in the neck.
The landlord’s got himself in an uproar again.”</p>
<p>Maria stood up and went to the table and picked up a sheet of paper
and handed it to Sherman and returned to the edge of the bed. It was a
letter from the law firm of Golan, Shander, Morgan, and Greenbaum to
Ms. Germaine Boll concerning her status as the tenant of a
rent-controlled apartment owned by Winter Real Properties, Inc. Sherman
couldn’t concentrate on it. He didn’t want to think about it. It was
getting late. Maria kept going off on tangents. It was getting late.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Maria. This is something Germaine has to respond
to.”</p>
<p>“Sherman?”</p>
<p>She was smiling with her lips parted. She stood up.</p>
<p>“Sherman, come here.”</p>
<p>He took a couple of steps toward her, but he resisted going very
close. The look on her face said she had very close in mind.</p>
<p>“You think you’re in trouble with your wife, and all you’ve done is
make a phone call.”</p>
<p>“Hah. I don’t think I’m in trouble, I know I’m in trouble.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you’re already in trouble, and you haven’t even done
anything, then you might as well do something, since it’s all the same
difference.”</p>
<p>Then she touched him.</p>
<p>King Priapus, he who had been scared to death, now rose up from the
dead.</p>
<p>Sprawled on the bed, Sherman caught a glimpse of the dachshund. The
beast had gotten up off the rug and had walked over to the bed and was
looking up at them and switching his tail.</p>
<p>Christ! Was there by any chance some way a dog could indicate…Was
there anything dogs did that showed they had seen…Judy knew about
animals. She clucked and fussed over Marshall’s every mood, until it was
revolting. Was there something dachshunds did after observing…But then
his nervous system began to dissolve, and he no longer cared.</p>
<p>His Majesty, the most ancient king, Priapus, Master of the Universe,
had no conscience.</p>
<p>Sherman let himself into the apartment and made a point of amplifying
the usual cozy sounds.</p>
<p>“Attaboy, Marshall, okay, okay.”</p>
<p>He took off his riding mac with a lot of rustling of the rubberized
material and clinking of the buckles and a few whews.</p>
<p>No sign of Judy.</p>
<p>The dining room, the living room, and a small library led off the
marble entry gallery. Each had its familiar glints and glows of carved
wood, cut glass, ecru silk shades, glazed lacquer, and the rest of the
breathtakingly expensive touches of his wife, the aspiring decorator.
Then he noticed. The big leather wing chair that usually faced the
doorway in the library was turned around. He could just see the top of
Judy’s head, from behind. There was a lamp beside the chair. She
appeared to be reading a book.</p>
<p>He went to the doorway.</p>
<p>“Well! We’re back!”</p>
<p>No response.</p>
<p>“You were right. I got soaking wet, and Marshall wasn’t happy.”</p>
<p>She didn’t look around. There was just her voice, coming from out of
the wing chair:</p>
<p>“Sherman, if you want to talk to someone named Maria, why do you call
me instead?”</p>
<p>Sherman took a step inside the room.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? If I want to talk to who?”</p>
<p>The voice: “Oh, for God’s sake. Please don’t bother lying.”</p>
<p>“Lying—about what?”</p>
<p>Then Judy stuck her head around one side of the wing chair. The look
she gave him!</p>
<p>With a sinking heart Sherman walked over to the chair. Within her
corona of soft brown hair his wife’s face was pure agony.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about, Judy?”</p>
<p>She was so upset she couldn’t get the words out at first. “I wish you
could see the cheap look on your face.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about!”</p>
<p>The shrillness in his voice made her laugh.</p>
<p>“All right, Sherman, you’re going to stand there and tell me you
didn’t call here and ask to speak to someone named Maria?”</p>
<p>“To who?”</p>
<p>“Some little hooker, if I had to guess, named Maria.”</p>
<p>“Judy, I swear to God, I don’t know what you’re talking about! I’ve
been out walking Marshall! I don’t even know anybody named Maria!
Somebody called here asking for somebody named Maria?”</p>
<p>“Uhhh!” It was a short, unbelieving groan. She stood up and looked at
him square in the eyes. “You stand there! You think I don’t know your
voice on the phone?”</p>
<p>“Maybe you do, but you haven’t heard it tonight. I swear to God.”</p>
<p>“You’re lying!” She gave him a hideous smile. “And you’re a rotten
liar. And you’re a rotten person. You think you’re so swell, and you’re
so cheap. You’re lying, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“I’m not lying. I swear to God, I took Marshall for a walk, and I
come back in here, and wham—I mean, I hardly know what to say, because I
truly don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re asking me to prove a
negative proposition.”</p>
<p>“Negative proposition.” Disgust dripped from the fancy phrase. “You
were gone long enough. Did you go kiss her good night and tuck her in,
too?”</p>
<p>“Judy—”</p>
<p>“Did you?”</p>
<p>Sherman rolled his head away from her blazing gaze and turned his
palms upward and sighed.</p>
<p>“Listen, Judy, you’re totally…totally…utterly wrong. I swear to
God.”</p>
<p>She stared at him. All at once there were tears in her eyes. “Oh, you
swear to God. Oh, Sherman.” Now she was beginning to snuffle back the
tears. “I’m not gonna—I’m going upstairs. There’s the telephone. Why
don’t you call her from here?” She was forcing the words out through her
tears. “I don’t care. I really don’t care.”</p>
<p>Then she walked out of the room. He could hear her shoes clicking
across the marble toward the staircase.</p>
<p>Sherman went over to the desk and sat down in his Hepplewhite swivel
chair. He slumped back. His eyes lit on the frieze that ran around the
ceiling of the little room. It was carved of Indian redwood, in high
relief, in the form of figures hurrying along a city sidewalk. Judy had
had it done in Hong Kong for an astonishing amount…of my money. Then he
leaned forward. Goddamn her. Desperately he tried to relight the fires
of righteous indignation. His parents had been right, hadn’t they? He
deserved better. She was two years older than he was, and his mother had
said such things could matter—which, the way she said it, meant it would
matter, and had he listened? Ohhhhh no. His father, supposedly referring
to Cowles Wilton, who had a short messy marriage to some obscure little
Jewish girl, had said, “Isn’t it just as easy to fall in love with a
rich girl from a good family?” And had he listened? Ohhhhhh no. And all
these years, Judy, as the daughter of a Midwestern history professor—a
Midwestern history professor!—had acted as if she was an intellectual
aristocrat—but she hadn’t minded using his money and his family to get
in with this new social crowd of hers and start her decorating business
and smear their names and their apartment across the pages of these
vulgar publications, W and Architectural Digest and the rest of them,
had she? Ohhhhhhhhh no, not for a minute! And what was he left with? A
forty-year-old bolting off to her Sports Training classes—</p>
<p>—and all at once, he sees her as he first saw her that night fourteen
years ago in the Village at Hal Thorndike’s apartment with the
chocolate-brown walls and the huge table covered with obelisks and the
crowd that went considerably beyond bohemian, if he understood
bohemian—and the girl with the light brown hair and the fine, fine
features and the wild short skimpy dress that revealed so much of her
perfect little body. And all at once he feels the ineffable way they
closed themselves up in the perfect cocoon, in his little apartment on
Charles Street and her little apartment on West Nineteenth, immune to
all that his parents and Buckley and St. Paul’s and Yale had ever
imposed on him—and he remembers how he told her—in practically these
words!—that their love would transcend…everything—</p>
<p>—and now she, forty years old, starved and Sports Trained to
near-perfection, goes crying off to bed.</p>
<p>He slumped back in the swivel chair once more. Like many a man before
him, he was no match, at last, for a woman’s tears. He hung his noble
chin over his collarbone. He folded.</p>
<p>Absentmindedly he pressed a button on the desktop. The tambour door
of a faux-Sheraton cabinet rolled back, revealing the screen of a
television set. Another of his dear weeping decorator’s touches. He
opened the desk drawer and took out the remote-control gadget and
clicked the set to life. The news. The Mayor of New York. A stage. An
angry crowd of black people. Harlem. A lot of thrashing about. A riot.
The Mayor takes cover. Shouts…chaos…a real rhubarb. Absolutely
pointless. To Sherman it had no more meaning than a gust of wind. He
couldn’t concentrate on it. He clicked it off.</p>
<p>She was right. The Master of the Universe was cheap, and he was
rotten, and he was a liar.</p>
