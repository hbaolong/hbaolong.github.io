<h4 id="the-girl-with-brown-lipstick">5. The Girl with Brown
Lipstick</h4>
<p>On the mezzanine of the sixth floor of the Bronx County Building,
near the elevators, was a wide entryway framed in two or three tons of
mahogany and marble and blocked by a counter and a gate. Behind the
counter sat a guard with a .38-caliber revolver in a holster on his hip.
The guard served as a receptionist. The revolver, which looked big
enough to stop a florist’s van, was supposed to serve as a deterrent to
the random berserk vengeful felons of the Bronx.</p>
<p>Over this entryway were some large Roman-style capital letters that
had been fabricated in brass at considerable expense to the taxpayers of
New York and cemented to the marble facing with epoxy glue. Once a week
a handyman got up on a ladder and rubbed Simichrome polish across the
letters, so that the legend RICHARD A. WEISS, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, BRONX
COUNTY blazed away more brightly than anything the building’s
architects, Joseph H. Freedlander and Max Hausle, had the nerve to put
even on the outside of the building in its golden dawn half a century
ago.</p>
<p>As Larry Kramer got off the elevator and walked toward this brassy
gleam, the right side of his lips twisted subversively. The A stood for
Abraham. Weiss was known to his friends and his political cronies and
the newspaper reporters and Channels 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 11 and his
constituents, most prominently the Jews and Italians up around Riverdale
and the Pelham Parkway and Co-op City, as Abe Weiss. He hated the
nickname Abe, which he had been stuck with when he was growing up in
Brooklyn. A few years back he had let it be known that he preferred to
be called Dick, and he had practically been laughed out of the Bronx
Democratic organization. That was the last time Abe Weiss ever mentioned
Dick Weiss. To Abe Weiss, being laughed out of the Bronx Democratic
organization, being separated from it in any fashion whatsoever, for
that matter, would have been like being thrown over the railing of a
Christmas cruise ship in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. So he was
Richard A. Weiss only in The New York Times and over this doorway.</p>
<p>The guard buzzed Kramer through the gate, and Kramer’s running shoes
squeaked on the marble floor. The guard gave them a dubious once-over.
As usual, Kramer was carrying his leather shoes in an AandandandandP
shopping bag.</p>
<p>Beyond the entryway, the level of grandeur in the District Attorney’s
Office went up and down. The office of Weiss himself was bigger and
showier, thanks to its paneled walls, than the Mayor of New York’s. The
bureau chiefs, for Homicide, Investigations, Major Offenses, Supreme
Court, Criminal Court, and Appeals, had their share of the paneling and
the leather or school-of-leather couches and the Contract Sheraton
armchairs. But by the time you got down to an assistant district
attorney, like Larry Kramer, you were looking at Good Enough for
Government Work when it came to interior decoration.</p>
<p>The two assistant district attorneys who shared the office with him,
Ray Andriutti and Jimmy Caughey, were sitting sprawled back in the
swivel chairs. There was just enough floor space in the room for three
metal desks, three swivel chairs, four filing cabinets, an old coat
stand with six savage hooks sticking out from it, and a table bearing a
Mr. Coffee machine and a promiscuous heap of plastic cups and spoons and
a gummy collage of paper napkins and white sugar envelopes and pink
saccharine envelopes stuck to a maroon plastic tray with a high
sweet-smelling paste composed of spilled coffee and Cremora powder. Both
Andriutti and Caughey were sitting with their legs crossed in the same
fashion. The left ankle was resting on top of the right knee, as if they
were such studs, they couldn’t have crossed their legs any farther if
they had wanted to. This was the accepted sitting posture of Homicide,
the most manly of the six bureaus of the District Attorney’s Office.</p>
<p>Both had their jackets off and hung with the perfect give-a-shit
carelessness on the coatrack. Their shirt collars were unbuttoned, and
their necktie knots were pulled down an inch or so. Andriutti was
rubbing the back of his left arm with his right hand, as if it itched.
In fact, he was feeling and admiring his triceps, which he pumped up at
least three times a week by doing sets of French curls with dumbbells at
the New York Athletic Club. Andriutti could afford to work out at the
Athletic Club, instead of on a carpet between a Dracaena fragrans tub
and a convertible couch, because he didn’t have a wife and a child to
support in an 88-a-month ant colony in the West Seventies. He didn’t
have to worry about his triceps and his deltoids and his lats deflating.
Andriutti liked the fact that when he reached around behind one of his
mighty arms with the other hand, it made the widest muscles of his back,
the lats, the latissima dorsae, fan out until they practically split his
shirt, and his pectorals hardened into a couple of mountains of pure
muscle. Kramer and Andriutti were of the new generation, in which the
terms triceps, deltoids, latissima dorsae, and pectoralis major were
better known than the names of the major planets. Andriutti rubbed his
triceps a hundred and twenty times a day, on the average.</p>
<p>Still rubbing them, Andriutti looked at Kramer as he walked in and
said: “Jesus Christ, here comes the bag lady. What the hell is this
fucking AandandandandP bag, Larry? You been coming in here with this
fucking bag every day this week.” Then he turned to Jimmy Caughey and
said, “Looks like a fucking bag lady.”</p>
<p>Caughey was also a jock, but more the triathlon type, with a narrow
face and a long chin. He just smiled at Kramer, as much as to say,
“Well, what do you say to that?”</p>
<p>Kramer said, “Your arm itch, Ray?” Then he looked at Caughey and
said, “Ray’s got this fucking allergy. It’s called weight lifter’s
disease.” Then he turned back to Andriutti. “Itches like a sonofabitch,
don’t it?”</p>
<p>Andriutti let his hand drop off his triceps. “And what are these
jogging shoes?” he said to Kramer. “Looks like those girls walking to
work at Merrill Lynch. All dressed up, and they got these fucking rubber
gunboats on their feet.”</p>
<p>“What the hell is in the bag?” said Caughey.</p>
<p>“My high heels,” said Kramer. He took off his jacket and jammed it
down, give-a-shit, on a coatrack hook in the accepted fashion and pulled
down his necktie and unbuttoned his shirt and sat down in his swivel
chair and opened up the shopping bag and fished out his Johnston
andandandand Murphy brown leather shoes and started taking off the
Nikes.</p>
<p>“Jimmy,” Andriutti said to Caughey, “did you know that Jewish
guys—Larry, I don’t want you to take this personally—did you know that
Jewish guys, even if they’re real stand-up guys, all have one faggot
gene? That’s a well-known fact. They can’t stand going out in the rain
without an umbrella or they have all this modern shit in their apartment
or they don’t like to go hunting or they’re for the fucking nuclear
freeze and affirmative action or they wear jogging shoes to work or some
goddamn thing. You know?”</p>
<p>“Gee,” said Kramer, “I don’t know why you thought I’d take it
personally.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Larry,” said Andriutti, “tell the truth. Deep down, don’t
you wish you were Italian or Irish?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Kramer, “that way I wouldn’t know what the fuck was
going on in this fucking place.”</p>
<p>Caughey started laughing. “Well, don’t let Ahab see those shoes,
Larry. He’ll have Jeanette issue a fucking memorandum.”</p>
<p>“No, he’ll call a fucking press conference,” said Andriutti.</p>
<p>“That’s always a safe fucking bet.”</p>
<p>And so another fucking day in the fucking Homicide Bureau of the
Bronx Fucking District Attorney’s Office was off to a fucking start.</p>
<p>An assistant D.A. in Major Offenses had started calling Abe Weiss
“Captain Ahab,” and now they all did. Weiss was notorious in his
obsession for publicity, even among a breed, the district attorney, that
was publicity-mad by nature. Unlike the great D.A.s of yore, such as
Frank Hogan, Burt Roberts, or Mario Merola, Weiss never went near a
courtroom. He didn’t have time. There were only so many hours in the day
for him to stay in touch with Channels 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 11 and the New
York Daily News, the Post, The City Light, and the Times.</p>
<p>Jimmy Caughey said, “I was just in seeing the captain. You
shoulda—”</p>
<p>“You were? What for?” asked Kramer with just a shade too much
curiosity and incipient envy in his voice.</p>
<p>“Me and Bernie,” said Caughey. “He wanted to know about the Moore
case.”</p>
<p>“Any good?”</p>
<p>“Piece a shit,” said Caughey. “This fucking guy Moore, he has a big
house in Riverdale, and his wife’s mother lives there with ’em, and
she’s been giving him a hard time for about thirty-seven fucking years,
right? So this guy, he loses his job. He’s working for one a these
reinsurance companies, and he’s making 00,000 or 00,000 a year, and now
he’s out a work for eight or nine months, and nobody’ll hire him, and he
don’t know what the hell to do, right? So one day he’s puttering around
out in the garden, and the mother-in-law comes out and says, ‘Well,
water seeks its own level.’ That’s a verbatim quote. ‘Water seeks its
own level. You oughta get a job as a gardener.’ So this guy, he’s out of
his fucking mind, he’s so mad. He goes in and tells his wife, ‘I’ve had
it with your mother. I’m gonna get my shotgun and scare her.’ So he goes
up to his bedroom, where he keeps this 12-gauge shotgun, and he comes
downstairs and heads for the mother-in-law, and he’s gonna scare the
shit out of her, and he says, ‘Okay, Gladys,’ and he trips on the rug,
and the gun goes off and kills her, and—ba-bing!—Murder Two.”</p>
<p>“Why was Weiss interested?”</p>
<p>“Well, the guy’s white, he’s got some money, he lives in a big house
in Riverdale. It looks at first like maybe he’s gonna fake an accidental
shooting.”</p>
<p>“Is that possible?”</p>
<p>“Naw. Fucking guy’s one a my boys. He’s your basic Irish who made
good, but he’s still a Harp. He’s drowning in remorse. You’d think he’d
shot his own mother, he feels so fucking guilty. Right now he’d confess
to anything. Bernie could sit him in front of the video camera and clean
up every homicide in the Bronx for the past five years. Naw, it’s a
piece a shit, but it looked good at first.”</p>
<p>Kramer and Andriutti contemplated this piece a shit without needing
any amplification. Every assistant D.A. in the Bronx, from the youngest
Italian just out of St. John’s Law School to the oldest Irish bureau
chief, who would be somebody like Bernie Fitzgibbon, who was forty-two,
shared Captain Ahab’s mania for the Great White Defendant. For a start,
it was not pleasant to go through life telling yourself, “What I do for
a living is, I pack blacks and Latins off to jail.” Kramer had been
raised as a liberal. In Jewish families like his, liberalism came with
the Similac and the Mott’s apple juice and the Instamatic and Daddy’s
grins in the evening. And even the Italians, like Ray Andriutti, and the
Irish, like Jimmy Caughey, who were not exactly burdened with liberalism
by their parents, couldn’t help but be affected by the mental atmosphere
of the law schools, where, for one thing, there were so many Jewish
faculty members. By the time you finished law school in the New York
area, it was, well…impolite!…on the ordinary social level…to go around
making jokes about the yoms. It wasn’t that it was morally wrong…It was
that it was in bad taste. So it made the boys uneasy, this eternal
prosecution of the blacks and Latins.</p>
<p>Not that they weren’t guilty. One thing Kramer had learned within two
weeks as an assistant D.A. in the Bronx was that 95 percent of the
defendants who got as far as the indictment stage, perhaps 98 percent,
were truly guilty. The caseload was so overwhelming, you didn’t waste
time trying to bring the marginal cases forward, unless the press was on
your back. They hauled in guilt by the ton, those blue-and-orange vans
out there on Walton Avenue. But the poor bastards behind the wire mesh
barely deserved the term criminal, if by criminal you had in mind the
romantic notion of someone who has a goal and seeks to achieve it
through some desperate way outside the law. No, they were simpleminded
incompetents, most of them, and they did unbelievably stupid, vile
things.</p>
<p>Kramer looked at Andriutti and Caughey, sitting there with their
mighty thighs akimbo. He felt superior to them. He was a graduate of the
Columbia Law School, and they were both graduates of St. John’s, widely
known as the law school for the also-rans of college academic
competition. And he was Jewish. Very early in life he had picked up the
knowledge that the Italians and the Irish were animals. The Italians
were pigs, and the Irish were mules or goats. He couldn’t remember if
his parents had actually used any such terms or not, but they got the
idea across very clearly. To his parents, New York City—New York? hell,
the whole U.S., the whole world!—was a drama called The Jews Confront
the Goyim, and the goyim were animals. And so what was he doing here
with these animals? A Jew in the Homicide Bureau was a rare thing. The
Homicide Bureau was the elite corps of the District Attorney’s Office,
the D.A.’s Marines, because homicide was the most serious of all crimes.
An assistant D.A. in Homicide had to be able to go out on the street to
the crime scenes at all hours, night and day, and be a real commando and
rub shoulders with the police and know how to confront defendants and
witnesses and intimidate them when the time came, and these were likely
to be the lowest, grimmest, scurviest defendants and witnesses in the
history of criminal justice. For fifty years, at least, maybe longer,
Homicide had been an Irish enclave, although recently the Italians had
made their way into it. The Irish had given Homicide their stamp. The
Irish were stone courageous. Even when it was insane not to, they never
stepped back. Andriutti had been right, or half right. Kramer didn’t
want to be Italian, but he did want to be Irish, and so did Ray
Andriutti, the dumb fuck. Yes, they were animals! The goyim were
animals, and Kramer was proud to be among the animals, in the Homicide
Bureau.</p>
<p>Anyway, here they were, the three of them, sitting in this Good
Enough for Government Work office at 6,000 to 2,000 a year instead of
down at Cravath, Swaine andandandand Moore or some such place at 36,000
to 42,000. They had been born a million miles from Wall Street, meaning
the outer boroughs, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. To their families,
their going to college and becoming lawyers had been the greatest thing
since Franklin D. Roosevelt. And so they sat around in the Homicide
Bureau talking about this fucking thing and that fucking thing and using
don’ts for doesn’ts and naws for no’s, as if they didn’t know any
better.</p>
<p>Here they were…and here he was, and where was he going? What were
these cases he was handling? Pieces of shit! Garbage collection…Arthur
Rivera. Arthur Rivera and another drug dealer get into an argument over
an order of pizza at a social club and pull knives, and Arthur says,
“Let’s put the weapons down and fight man to man.” And they do,
whereupon Arthur pulls out a second knife and stabs the other fellow in
the chest and kills him…Jimmy Dollard. Jimmy Dollard and his closest
pal, Otis Blakemore, and three other black guys are drinking and taking
cocaine and playing a game called the dozens, in which the idea is to
see how outrageously you can insult the other fellow, and Blakemore is
doing an inspired number on Jimmy, and Jimmy pulls out a revolver and
shoots him through the heart and then collapses on the table, sobbing
and saying, “My man! My man Stan! I shot my man Stan!”…And the case of
Herbert 92X—</p>
<p>For an instant the thought of Herbert’s case triggered a vision of
the girl with brown lipstick—</p>
<p>The press couldn’t even see these cases. It was just poor people
killing poor people. To prosecute such cases was to be part of the
garbage-collection service, necessary and honorable, plodding and
anonymous.</p>
<p>Captain Ahab wasn’t so ridiculous, after all. Press coverage! Ray and
Jimmy could laugh all they wanted, but Weiss had made sure the entire
city knew his name. Weiss had an election coming up, and the Bronx was
70 percent black and Latin, and he was going to make sure the name Abe
Weiss was pumped out to them on every channel that existed. He might not
do much else, but he was going to do that.</p>
<p>A telephone rang: Ray’s. “Homicide,” he said. “Andriutti…Bernie’s not
here. I think he’s in court…What?…Go over that again?” Long pause.
“Well, was he hit by a car or wasn’t he?…Unnh-hunnh…Well, shit, I don’t
know. You better talk it over with Bernie. Okay?…Okay.” He hung up and
shook his head and looked at Jimmy Caughey. “That was some detective
who’s over at Lincoln Hospital. Says they got a likely-to-die, some kid
who comes into the emergency room and don’t know whether he slipped in
the bathtub and broke his wrist or got hit by a Mercedes-Benz. Or some
such shit. Wants to talk to Bernie. So let him fucking talk to
Bernie.”</p>
<p>Ray shook his head some more, and Kramer and Caughey nodded
sympathetically. The eternal pieces a shit in the Bronx.</p>
<p>Kramer looked at his watch and stood up.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, “you guys can sit here and fuck-all, if you want,
but I gotta go fucking listen to that renowned Middle Eastern scholar
Herbert 92X read from the Koran.”</p>
<p>There were thirty-five courtrooms in the Bronx County Building
devoted to criminal cases, and each one was known as a “part.” They had
been built at a time, the early 1930s, when it was still assumed that
the very look of a courtroom should proclaim the gravity and omnipotence
of the rule of law. The ceilings were a good fifteen feet high. The
walls were paneled throughout in a dark wood. The judge’s bench was a
stage with a vast desk. The desk had enough cornices, moldings, panels,
pilasters, inlays, and sheer hardwood mass to make you believe that
Solomon himself, who was a king, would have found it imposing. The seats
in the spectators’ section were separated from the judge’s bench, the
jury box, and the tables of the prosecutor, the defendant, and the clerk
of the court by a wooden balustrade with an enormous carved top rail,
the so-called Bar of Justice. In short, there was nothing whatsoever in
the look of the premises to tip off the unwary to the helter-skelter of
a criminal court judge’s daily task.</p>
<p>The moment Kramer walked in, he could tell that the day had gotten
off to a bad start in Part 60. He had only to look at the judge.
Kovitsky was up on the bench, in his black robes, leaning forward with
both forearms on his desktop. His chin was down so low it seemed about
to touch it. His bony skull and his sharp beak jutted out of the robe at
such a low angle he looked like a buzzard. Kramer could see his irises
floating and bobbing on the whites of his eyes as he scanned the room
and its raggedy collection of humanity. He looked as if he were about to
flap his wings and strike. Kramer felt ambivalent about Kovitsky. On one
hand, he resented his courtroom tirades, which were often personal and
designed to humiliate. On the other hand, Kovitsky was a Jewish warrior,
a son of the Masada. Only Kovitsky could have stopped the loudmouths in
the prison vans with a gob of spit.</p>
<p>“Where’s Mr. Sonnenberg?” said Kovitsky. There was no response.</p>
<p>So he said it again, this time in an amazing baritone that nailed
every syllable into the back wall and startled all newcomers to the
courtroom of Judge Myron Kovitsky: “WHERE IS MIS-TER SON-NEN-BERG!”</p>
<p>Except for two little boys and a little girl, who were running
between the benches and playing tag, the spectators froze. One by one
they congratulated themselves. No matter how miserable their fates, at
least they had not fallen so low as to be Mr. Sonnenberg, that miserable
insect, whoever he was.</p>
<p>That miserable insect was a lawyer, and Kramer knew the nature of his
offense, which was that his absence was impeding the shoveling of the
chow into the gullet of the criminal justice system, Part 60. In each
part, the day began with the so-called calendar session, during which
the judge dealt with motions and pleas in a variety of cases, perhaps as
many as a dozen in a morning. Kramer had to laugh every time he saw a
television show with a courtroom scene. They always showed a trial in
progress. A trial! Who the hell dreamed up these goddamned shows? Every
year there were 7,000 felony indictments in the Bronx and the capacity
for 650 trials, at the most. The judges had to dispose of the other
6,350 cases in either of two ways. They could dismiss a case or they
could let the defendant plead guilty to a reduced charge in return for
not forcing the court to go through a trial. Dismissing cases was a
hazardous way to go about reducing the backlog, even for a grotesque
cynic. Every time a felony case was thrown out, somebody, such as the
victim or his family, was likely to yell, and the press was only too
happy to attack judges who let the malefactors go free. That left the
plea bargains, which were the business of the calendar sessions. So the
calendar sessions were the very alimentary canal of the criminal justice
system in the Bronx.</p>
<p>Every week the clerk of each part turned in a scorecard to Louis
Mastroiani, chief administrative judge for the criminal division,
Supreme Court, Bronx County. The scorecard showed how many cases the
judge in that part had on his docket and how many he had disposed of
that week, through plea bargains, dismissals, and trials. On the wall of
the courtroom, over the judge’s head, it said IN GOD WE TRUST. On the
scorecard, however, it said CASE BACKLOG ANALYSIS, and a judge’s
effectiveness was rated almost entirely according to CASE BACKLOG
ANALYSIS.</p>
<p>Practically all cases were called for 9:30 a.m. If the clerk called a
case, and the defendant was not present or his lawyer was not present or
if any of a dozen other things occurred to make it impossible to shove
this case a little farther through the funnel, the principals in the
next case would be on hand, presumably, ready to step forward. So the
spectators’ section was dotted with little clumps of people, none of
them spectators in any sporting sense. There were defendants and their
lawyers, defendants and their pals, defendants and their families. The
three small children came slithering out from between two benches, ran
toward the back of the courtroom, giggling, and disappeared behind the
last bench. A woman turned her head and scowled at them and didn’t
bother to go fetch them. Now Kramer recognized the trio. They were
Herbert 92X’s children. Not that he found this at all remarkable; there
were children in the courtrooms every day. The courts were a form of
day-care center in the Bronx. Playing tag in Part 60 during Daddy’s
motions, pleas, trials, and sentencings was just a part of growing
up.</p>
<p>Kovitsky turned toward the clerk of the court, who sat at a table
below the judge’s bench and off to the side. The clerk was a bull-necked
Italian named Charles Bruzzielli. He had his jacket off. He wore a
short-sleeved dress shirt with the collar open and his necktie at
half-mast. You could see the top of his T-shirt. The tie had a huge
Windsor knot.</p>
<p>“Is that Mr…” Kovitsky looked down at a piece of paper on his desk,
then at Bruzzielli. “…Lockwood?”</p>
<p>Bruzzielli nodded yes, and Kovitsky looked straight ahead at a
slender figure who had walked from the spectators’ benches up to the
bar.</p>
<p>“Mr. Lockwood,” said Kovitsky, “where’s your attorney? Where’s
Mr. Sonnenberg?”</p>
<p>“I ’unno,” said the figure.</p>
<p>He was barely audible. He was no more than nineteen or twenty. He had
dark skin. He was so thin there was no sign of shoulders under his black
thermal jacket. He wore black stovepipe jeans and a pair of huge white
sneakers that closed with Velcro tabs rather than shoelaces.</p>
<p>Kovitsky stared at him a moment, then said, “All right, Mr. Lockwood,
you take a seat. If and when Mr. Sonnenberg deigns to favor us with his
presence, we’ll call your case again.”</p>
<p>Lockwood turned around and began walking back to the spectators’
benches. He had the same pumping swagger that practically every young
defendant in the Bronx affected, the Pimp Roll. Such stupid
self-destructive macho egos, thought Kramer. They never failed to show
up with the black jackets and the sneakers and the Pimp Roll. They never
failed to look every inch the young felon before judges, juries,
probation officers, court psychiatrists, before every single soul who
had any say in whether or not they went to prison or for how long.
Lockwood pimp-rolled to a bench in the rear of the spectators’ section
and sat down next to two more boys in black thermal jackets. These were
no doubt his buddies, his comrades. The defendant’s comrades always
arrived in court in their shiny black thermal jackets and go-to-hell
sneakers. That was very bright, too. That immediately established the
fact that the defendant was not a poor defenseless victim of life in the
ghetto but part of a pack of remorseless young felons of the sort who
liked to knock down old ladies with Lucite canes on the Grand Concourse
and steal their handbags. The whole pack entered the courtroom full of
juice, bulging with steel muscles and hard-jawed defiance, ready to
defend the honor and, if necessary, the hides of their buddies against
the System. But soon a stupefying tide of tedium and confusion rolled
over them all. They were primed for action. They were not primed for
what the day required, which was waiting while something they never
heard of, a calendar session, swamped them in a lot of shine-on
language, such as “deigns to favor us with his presence.”</p>
<p>Kramer walked past the bar and headed over to the clerk’s table.
Three other assistant D.A.s stood there, looking on and waiting their
turns before the judge.</p>
<p>The clerk said, “The People versus Albert and Marilyn Krin—”</p>
<p>He hesitated and looked down at the papers before him. He looked at a
young woman standing three or four feet away, an assistant district
attorney named Patti Stullieri, and he said in a stage whisper, “What
the hell is this?”</p>
<p>Kramer looked over his shoulder. The document said, “Albert and
Marilyn Krnkka.”</p>
<p>“Kri-nick-a,” said Patti Stullieri.</p>
<p>“Albert and Marilyn Kri-nick-a!” he declaimed. “Indictment number
3-2-8-1.” Then to Patti Stullieri: “Jesus, what the hell kind of name is
that?”</p>
<p>“It’s Yugoslav.”</p>
<p>“Yugoslav. It looks like somebody’s fingers got caught in a fucking
typewriter.”</p>
<p>From the rear of the spectators’ section a couple came marching up to
the great railing and leaned forward. The man, Albert Krnkka, smiled in
a bright-eyed fashion and seemed to want to engage the attention of
Judge Kovitsky. Albert Krnkka was a tall, gangling man with a five-inch
goatee but no mustache at all and long blond hair like an old-fashioned
rock musician’s. He had a bony nose, a long neck, and an Adam’s apple
that seemed to move up and down a foot when he swallowed. He wore a
teal-green shirt with an outsized collar and, in place of buttons, a
zipper that ran diagonally from his left shoulder to the right side of
his waist. Beside him was his wife. Marilyn Krnkka was a black-haired
woman with a thin, delicate face. Her eyes were two slits. She kept
compressing her lips and grimacing.</p>
<p>Everyone, Judge Kovitsky, the clerk, Patti Stullieri, even Kramer
himself, looked toward the Krnkkas, expecting their lawyer to come
forward or come in through the side door or materialize in some fashion.
But there was no lawyer.</p>
<p>Furious, Kovitsky turned toward Bruzzielli and said, “Who’s
representing these people?”</p>
<p>“I think Marvin Sunshine,” said Bruzzielli.</p>
<p>“Well, where is he? I saw him back there a few minutes ago. What’s
gotten into all these characters?”</p>
<p>Bruzzielli gave him the Primordial Shrug and rolled his eyes, as if
the whole thing pained him tremendously but there was nothing he could
do about it.</p>
<p>Kovitsky’s head was now down very low. His irises were floating like
destroyers on a lake of white. But before he could launch into a
blistering discourse on delinquent lawyers, a voice spoke up from the
bar.</p>
<p>“Your Honor! Your Honor! Hey, Judge!”</p>
<p>It was Albert Krnkka. He was waving his right hand, trying to get
Kovitsky’s attention. His arms were thin, but his wrists and his hands
were huge. His mouth hung open in a half smile that was supposed to
convince the judge that he was a reasonable man. In fact, he looked,
every inch of him, like one of those wild tall rawboned men whose
metabolisms operate at triple speed and who, more than any other people
on earth, are prone to explosions.</p>
<p>“Hey, Judge! Look.”</p>
<p>Kovitsky stared, amazed by this performance. “Hey, Judge! Look. Two
weeks ago she told us two to six, right?”</p>
<p>When Albert Krnkka said “two to six,” he raised both hands up in the
air and stuck out two fingers on each hand, like a v for victory or a
peace sign, and flailed them in the air, as if he were beating a pair of
invisible aerial drums in time to the phrase “two to six.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Krnkka,” said Kovitsky, rather softly for him.</p>
<p>“And now she’s coming in ’ere wit’ three to nine,” said Albert
Krnkka. “We awready said, ‘Okay, two to six’”—once again he raised his
hands and the pair of v’s and beat the air in time to “two to six”—“and
she’s coming in ’ere wit’ three to nine. Two to six”—he beat the
air—“two to six—”</p>
<p>“MIS-TER KRI-NICK-A, IF YOU—”</p>
<p>But Albert Krnkka was unbowed by Judge Kovitsky’s hammering
voice.</p>
<p>“Two to six”—blam, blam, blam—“you got it!”</p>
<p>“MIS-TER KRI-NICK-A. If you want to petition the court, you must do
so through your attorney.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Judge, you ask her!” He stabbed his left forefinger toward
Patti Stullieri. His arm seemed a mile long. “She’s the one. She offered
two to six, Judge. Now she come in here wit’—”</p>
<p>“Mister Krnkka—”</p>
<p>“Two to six, Judge, two to six!” Realizing that his time at the bar
was growing short, Albert Krnkka now compressed his message into its key
phrase, all the while beating the air with his huge hands.</p>
<p>“Two to six! You got it! Two to six! You got it!”</p>
<p>“Mister Krnkka…SIDDOWN! Wait for your attorney.”</p>
<p>Albert Krnkka and his wife began backing away from the bar, looking
at Kovitsky the whole time, as if leaving a throne room. Albert kept
mouthing the words “two to six” and waving his v fingers.</p>
<p>Larry Kramer moved over to where Patti Stullieri was standing and
said, “What did they do?”</p>
<p>Patti Stullieri said, “The wife held a knife to a girl’s throat while
the husband raped her.”</p>
<p>“Jesus,” said Kramer, in spite of himself.</p>
<p>Patti Stullieri smiled in a world-weary fashion. She was twenty-eight
or twenty-nine years old. Kramer wondered if she was worth making a play
for. She was not a looker, but her Hard Number pose turned him on
somehow. Kramer wondered what she had been like in high school. He
wondered if she had been one of those thin nervous skanks who were
always irritable and difficult and lacking in femininity without being
strong. On the other hand, she had the olive skin, the thick black hair,
the big dark eyes, the Cleopatra lips that in Kramer’s mind added up to
the Italian Dirty Girl look. In high school—Jesus, those Italian Dirty
Girls!—Kramer had always found them gross, stupid beyond belief,
anti-intellectual, unapproachable, and intensely desirable.</p>
<p>The door to the courtroom swung open, and in walked an old man with a
large, florid, rather lordly head. Debonair, that was the word. Or at
least he was debonair by the standards of Gibraltar. He wore a navy-blue
double-breasted pinstripe suit, a white shirt with a starched collar,
and a dark red necktie. His black hair, which was thin and had the inky
dullness of a dye job, was combed straight back and plastered down on
his skull. He had an old-fashioned pencil mustache, creating a sharp
black line on either side of the gully under his nose.</p>
<p>Larry Kramer, who was standing near the clerk’s desk, looked up and
stared. He knew the man. There was something charming—no, brave—about
his style. At the same time, it made you shiver. This man had once been,
as Kramer was now, an assistant district attorney. Bing! Bing! Bing!
Thirty years had gone by, and here he was finishing out his career in
private practice, representing these poor incompetents, including the
18-b’s, the ones who couldn’t afford lawyers. Bing! Bing! Bing! Not a
very long time, thirty years!</p>
<p>Larry Kramer wasn’t the only one who stopped and stared. The man’s
entrance was an event. His chin was the shape of a melon. He held it
cocked up at a self-satisfied angle, as if he were a boulevardier, as if
the Grand Concourse could still be called a boulevard.</p>
<p>“MIS-TER SONNENBERG!”</p>
<p>The old lawyer looked toward Kovitsky. He seemed pleasantly surprised
that his arrival should occasion such a hearty greeting.</p>
<p>“We called your case five minutes ago!”</p>
<p>“I apologize, Your Honor,” said Sonnenberg, sauntering up to the
defendant’s desk. He swung his great chin upward in an elegant arc
toward the judge. “I was held over in Part 62 by Judge Meldnick.”</p>
<p>“Whaddaya doing with a case in Part 62 when you knew this court was
putting you at the top of the calendar as a personal accommodation? Your
client Mr. Lockwood has a job, as I recall.”</p>
<p>“That’s correct, Your Honor, but I was assured—”</p>
<p>“Your client is here.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“He’s waiting for you.”</p>
<p>“I’m aware of that, Your Honor, but I had no idea that Judge
Meldnick—”</p>
<p>“All right, Mr. Sonnenberg, are you ready to proceed now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Honor.”</p>
<p>Kovitsky had the clerk, Bruzzielli, recall the case. The black youth,
Lockwood, got up from the spectators’ section and came pimp-rolling up
to the defendant’s desk, beside Sonnenberg. It soon became apparent that
the purpose of this hearing was to allow Lockwood to plead guilty to the
charge, which was armed robbery, in return for a light sentence, two to
six years, offered by the District Attorney’s Office. But Lockwood
wasn’t going for it. All that Sonnenberg could do was reiterate his
client’s plea of not guilty.</p>
<p>Kovitsky said, “Mr. Sonnenberg, would you approach the bench, please?
And Mr. Torres?”</p>
<p>Torres was the assistant district attorney on the case. He was short
and quite fat, even though he was barely thirty years old. He had the
sort of mustache that young lawyers and doctors wear to try to look
older and graver.</p>
<p>As Sonnenberg drew near, Kovitsky said, in an amiable, conversational
tone, “You look just like David Niven today, Mr. Sonnenberg.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, Judge,” said Sonnenberg, “David Niven I’m not. William Powell
maybe, but not David Niven.”</p>
<p>“William Powell? You’re dating yourself, Mr. Sonnenberg. You’re not
that old, are you?” Kovitsky turned to Torres and said, “The next thing
we know, Mr. Sonnenberg’s gonna be leaving us for the Sun Belt. He’s
gonna be down there in a condominium, and all he’ll have to worry about
is getting to the shopping mall in time for the Early Bird special at
Denny’s. He won’t even have to think about getting up in the morning and
making pleas in Part 60 in the Bronx.”</p>
<p>“Listen, Judge, I swear—”</p>
<p>“Mr. Sonnenberg, do you know Mr. Torres?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes.”</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Torres understands about condominiums and Early Bird
specials. He’s half a Yiddeleh himself.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” Sonnenberg didn’t know whether he was supposed to appear
pleased or what.</p>
<p>“Yeah, he’s half a Puerto Rican and half a Yiddeleh. Right,
Mr. Torres?”</p>
<p>Torres smiled and shrugged, trying to appear appropriately
amused.</p>
<p>“So he used his Yiddisheh kop and applied for a minority scholarship
to law school,” said Kovitsky. “His Yiddisheh half applied for a
minority scholarship for his Puerto Rican half! Is that One World or
isn’t it? It’s using your fucking kop, anyway.”</p>
<p>Kovitsky looked at Sonnenberg until he smiled, and then he looked at
Torres until he smiled, and then Kovitsky beamed at both of them. Why
had he turned so jolly all of a sudden? Kramer looked over at the
defendant, Lockwood. He was standing at the defendant’s table and
staring at this jolly threesome. What must be going through his mind?
His fingertips rested on the table, and his chest seemed to have caved
in. His eyes! His eyes were the eyes of the hunted in the night. He
stared at the spectacle of his lawyer grinning and chuckling with the
judge and the prosecutor. There he was, his white lawyer smiling and
jabbering with the white judge and the fat white prick who was trying to
put him away.</p>
<p>Sonnenberg and Torres were both standing at the bench, looking up at
Kovitsky. Now Kovitsky got down to work.</p>
<p>“What have you offered him, Mr. Torres?”</p>
<p>“Two to six, Judge.”</p>
<p>“What’s your client say, Mr. Sonnenberg?”</p>
<p>“He won’t take it, Judge. I talked to him last week, and I talked to
him this morning. He wants to go to trial.”</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Kovitsky. “Did you explain to him that he’ll be eligible
for work release in a year? It’s not a bad deal.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Sonnenberg, “the problem is, as Mr. Torres knows, my
client’s a Y.O. That one was for the same thing, armed robbery, and if
he pleads guilty to this one, then he’s gotta serve time for that one,
too.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Kovitsky. “Well, what will he take?”</p>
<p>“He’ll take one and a half to four and a half, with the sentence for
the first one subsumed under this one.”</p>
<p>“What about it, Mr. Torres?”</p>
<p>The young assistant district attorney sucked in his breath and
lowered his eyes and shook his head. “I can’t do it, Judge. We’re
talking about armed robbery!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know,” said Kovitsky, “but was he the one with the gun?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Torres.</p>
<p>Kovitsky lifted his eyes from the faces of Sonnenberg and Torres and
looked out at Lockwood.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t look like a bad kid,” said Kovitsky, for Torres’s
benefit. “In fact, he looks like a baby. I see these kids in here every
day. They’re easily led. They live in some kinda shithook neighborhood,
and they end up doing stupid things. What’s he like,
Mr. Sonnenberg?”</p>
<p>“That’s about the size of it, Judge,” said Sonnenberg. “The kid’s a
follower. He’s no brain surgeon, but he’s no hard case, either. Not in
my opinion.”</p>
<p>This personality profile was evidently supposed to wear Torres down
into offering Lockwood a sentence of only one and a third to four years,
with his Y.O. conviction in effect forgotten. Y.O. stood for “youthful
offender.”</p>
<p>“Look, Judge, it’s no use,” Torres said. “I can’t do it. Two to six
is as low as I can go. My office—”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you call Frank?” asked Kovitsky.</p>
<p>“It’s no use, Judge. We’re talking about armed robbery! He may not’ve
held a gun on the victim, but that was because he was going through his
pockets with both hands! A sixty-nine-year-old man with a stroke. Walks
like this.”</p>
<p>Torres did a shuffle in front of the bench, gimping along like an old
man with a stroke.</p>
<p>Kovitsky smiled. “That’s the Yiddeleh coming out! Mr. Torres has some
of Ted Lewis’s chromosomes and doesn’t even know it.”</p>
<p>“Ted Lewis was Jewish?” asked Sonnenberg.</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Kovitsky. “He was a comedian, wasn’t he? Okay,
Mr. Torres, calm down.”</p>
<p>Torres came back to the bench. “The victim, Mr. Borsalino, says he
broke a rib. We’re not even charging him with that, because the old man
never went to see a doctor about the rib. No, two to six is it.”</p>
<p>Kovitsky thought that over. “Did you explain that to your
client?”</p>
<p>“Sure I did,” said Sonnenberg. He shrugged and made a face, as if to
say his client wouldn’t listen to reason. “He’s willing to take his
chances.”</p>
<p>“Take his chances?” said Kovitsky. “But he signed a confession.”</p>
<p>Sonnenberg made the face again and arched his eyebrows.</p>
<p>Kovitsky said, “Let me talk to him.”</p>
<p>Sonnenberg screwed up his lips and rolled his eyes, as if to say,
“Good luck.”</p>
<p>Kovitsky looked up again and stared at Lockwood and stuck his chin up
in the air and said, “Son…come here.”</p>
<p>The boy stood at the table, frozen, not altogether sure the judge was
talking to him and not somebody else. So Kovitsky put on a smile, the
smile of the benevolent leader, He Who Is Willing to Be Patient, and he
beckoned with his right hand and said, “Come on up here, son. I want to
talk to you.”</p>
<p>The boy, Lockwood, started walking, slowly, warily, up to where
Sonnenberg and Torres were standing and looked at Kovitsky. The look he
gave him was completely empty. Kovitsky stared back. It was like looking
at a small empty house at night with all the lights out.</p>
<p>“Son,” said Kovitsky, “you don’t look like a bad sort to me. You look
like a nice young man. Now, I want you to give yourself a chance. I’ll
give you a chance, but first you’ve got to give yourself a chance.”</p>
<p>The Kovitsky stared into Lockwood’s eyes as if what he was about to
say were one of the most important things he was likely to hear in his
lifetime.</p>
<p>“Son,” he said, “whaddaya wanna get involved in all these fucking
robberies for?”</p>
<p>Lockwood’s lips moved, but he fought the impulse to say anything,
perhaps for fear he might incriminate himself.</p>
<p>“What does your mother say? You live with your mother?”</p>
<p>Lockwood nodded yes.</p>
<p>“What does your mother say? She ever hit you upside the head?”</p>
<p>“Naw,” said Lockwood. His eyes appeared misty. Kovitsky took this as
a sign that he was making progress.</p>
<p>“Now, son,” he said, “do you have a job?”</p>
<p>Lockwood nodded yes.</p>
<p>“Whaddaya do?”</p>
<p>“Security guard.”</p>
<p>“Security guard,” said Kovitsky. He stared off at a blank spot on the
wall, as if pondering the implication for society of that answer, and
then decided to stick to the issue at hand.</p>
<p>“See?” said Kovitsky. “You’ve got a job, you’ve got a home, you’re
young, you’re a nice-looking, bright young man. You’ve got a lot going
for you. You’ve got more than most people. But you’ve got one big
problem to overcome. YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE FUCKING ROBBERIES! Now,
the district attorney has made you an offer of two to six years. If you
take that offer and you behave yourself, this will all be behind you, in
no time, and you’ll still be a young man with your whole life ahead of
you. If you go to trial and you’re convicted, you could get eight to
twenty-five. Now think about that. The district attorney has made you an
offer.”</p>
<p>Lockwood said nothing.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you take it?” asked Kovitsky.</p>
<p>“No reason.”</p>
<p>“No reason?”</p>
<p>Lockwood looked away. He wasn’t going to parry words. He was just
going to hold tight.</p>
<p>“Look, son,” said Kovitsky, “I’m trying to help you. This thing won’t
go away. You can’t just close your eyes and hope it’s all gonna
disappear. Do you understand what I’m saying?”</p>
<p>Lockwood kept looking down or to the side, always a few inches away
from eye contact with the judge. Kovitsky kept moving his head as if to
intercept him, like a hockey goalie.</p>
<p>“Look at me, son. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>Lockwood gave in and looked at him. It was the sort of look a firing
squad might expect to see.</p>
<p>“Now, son, think of it this way. It’s like having cancer. You know
about cancer.”</p>
<p>There wasn’t a glimmer of comprehension of cancer or anything
else.</p>
<p>“Cancer doesn’t just go away, either. You have to do something about
it. If you catch it early, while it’s small, before it spreads through
your whole body and takes over your whole life—and ruins your life—and
ends your life—you understand?—ends your life—if you do something about
it while it’s a small problem, if you have the small operation you need,
then that’s it!” Kovitsky threw his hands up in the air and lifted his
chin and smiled, as if he were the very personification of buoyancy.
“Now, it’s the same way with the problem you have now. Right now it’s a
small problem. If you plead guilty and receive a sentence of two to six
years and you behave yourself, you’ll be eligible for a work-release
program after one year and full parole after two years. And it’ll all be
behind you. But if you go to trial and you’re found guilty, then your
minimum sentence will be eight years. Eight and a third to twenty-five.
Eight—you’re only nineteen now. Eight years, that’s almost half as long
as you’ve been on this earth. You wanna spend your whole fucking youth
in jail?”</p>
<p>Lockwood averted his eyes. He didn’t say one thing or the other.</p>
<p>“So how about it?” asked Kovitsky.</p>
<p>Without looking up, Lockwood shook his head no.</p>
<p>“All right, if you’re innocent, I don’t want you to plead guilty, no
matter what anybody offers you. But you signed a confession! The
district attorney has a videotape of you making that confession!
Whaddaya gonna do about that?”</p>
<p>“I ’unno,” said Lockwood.</p>
<p>“What does your attorney say?”</p>
<p>“I ’unno.”</p>
<p>“Come on, son. Of course you know. You have an excellent attorney.
He’s one of the best, Mr. Sonnenberg is. He has a lot of experience. You
listen to him. He’ll tell you I’m right. This thing isn’t gonna go away,
any more than cancer’s gonna go away.”</p>
<p>Lockwood kept looking down. Whatever his lawyer and the judge and the
D.A. had cooked up, he wasn’t buying it.</p>
<p>“Look, son,” said Kovitsky, “talk it over some more with your
attorney. Talk it over with your mother. What does your mother say?”</p>
<p>Lockwood looked up with live hatred. Tears began to form in his eyes.
It was very touchy business, talking to these boys about their mothers.
But Kovitsky stared right at him.</p>
<p>“All right, Counselor!” said Kovitsky, raising his voice and looking
over toward Sonnenberg. “And, Mr. Torres. I’m postponing this until two
weeks from today. And, son,” he said to Lockwood, “you think over what I
told you, and you confer with Mr. Sonnenberg, and you make up your mind.
Okay?”</p>
<p>Lockwood gave Kovitsky one last flicker of a glance and nodded yes
and walked away from the bench toward the spectators’ section.
Sonnenberg walked with him and said something, but Lockwood made no
response. When he passed the railing and saw his buddies getting up from
the last bench, Lockwood began pimp-rolling. Outta here! Back to…the
Life! The three of them pimp-rolled out of the courtroom, with
Sonnenberg sauntering behind, his chin cocked up at a thirty-degree
angle.</p>
<p>The morning was grinding on, and so far Kovitsky hadn’t disposed of a
single case.</p>
<p>It was late in the morning when Kovitsky finally worked his way
through the calendar and reached the trial of Herbert 92X, which was now
in its fourth day. Kramer was standing by the prosecution table. The
court officers were rotating their shoulder sockets and stretching and
otherwise readying themselves for the arrival of Herbert 92X, whom they
considered enough of a maniac to do something stupid and violent in the
courtroom. Herbert 92X’s lawyer, Albert Teskowitz, appointed by the
court, walked over from the defense table. He was a scrawny stooped man
with a pale blue plaid jacket that rode three or four inches off his
neck and a pair of brown slacks that had never been introduced to the
jacket. His thinning gray hair was the color of dry ice. He flashed
Kramer a screwy little smile that as much as declared, “The charade is
about to begin.”</p>
<p>“Well, Larry,” he said, “are you ready for the wisdom of Allah?”</p>
<p>“Let me ask you something,” said Kramer. “Does Herbert select this
stuff every day with the idea that it makes some kind of comment on
what’s going on in the case, or does he just open the book? I can’t
tell.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Teskowitz. “I stay off the subject, to tell you
the truth. Just mention it, and it’s an hour out of your life. You ever
talk to a logical lunatic before? They’re much worse than a plain
lunatic.”</p>
<p>Teskowitz was such a bad lawyer, Kramer felt sorry for Herbert. But,
then, he felt sorry for him, anyway. Herbert 92X’s legal name was
Herbert Cantrell; 92X was his Muslim name. He was a driver for a liquor
distributor. That was one of a number of things that made Kramer believe
he wasn’t a real Muslim. A real Muslim wouldn’t have anything to do with
liquor. In any case, one day Herbert’s truck was hijacked on Willis
Avenue by three Italians from Brooklyn who had done little else for the
past decade but hijack trucks for whoever was paying for hijacking
trucks. They pulled guns on Herbert, tied him up, gave him a punch in
the face, threw him into a Dumpster on a side street, and warned him not
to move for an hour. Then the three Italians drove the liquor truck to
the warehouse of their employer of the moment, a wiseguy liquor
distributor who routinely cut costs by hijacking merchandise. They drove
up with the hijacked truck, and the loading-dock foreman said, “Holy
shit! You guys are in a lotta trouble! That’s one a our trucks!”</p>
<p>“Whaddaya mean?”</p>
<p>“That’s one a our trucks! I just loaded it two hours ago! You’re
boosting stuff we just got through boosting! You just worked over one a
our guys! You’re in a lotta trouble!”</p>
<p>So the three Italians jumped into the truck and sped to the Dumpster
to give Herbert 92X back his truck. But Herbert had managed to get out.
They started driving up and down the streets in the truck, looking for
him. They finally found him in a bar where he had gone to steady his
nerves. This was definitely not the Muslim way. They came walking in to
tell him they were sorry and that he could have his truck back, but
Herbert thought they were coming after him because he had ignored their
warning to stay in the Dumpster. So he pulled a .38-caliber revolver out
from under his thermal jacket—it had been there all along, but these
hard cases had gotten the drop on him—and he fired two shots. He missed
the three Italians but hit and killed a man named Nestor Cabrillo, who
had come in to make a telephone call. The firearm was perhaps a
necessary item of defense in what was obviously a hazardous occupation.
But he was not licensed to carry it, and Nestor Cabrillo was an
upstanding citizen with five children. So Herbert was charged with
manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon, and the case had to be
prosecuted, and Kramer was stuck with that task. The case was a study in
stupidity, incompetence, and uselessness; in short, a piece of shit.
Herbert 92X refused to accept a plea bargain, since he regarded what had
happened as an accident. He was only sorry that the .38 had jerked his
hand around so. So this piece a shit had now gone to trial.</p>
<p>A door off to the side of the judge’s bench opened, and out came
Herbert 92X and two corrections officers. The Corrections Department ran
the detention pens, which were some windowless cages half a floor above
the courtroom. Herbert 92X was a tall man. His eyes shone out of the
shadow of a checked Yasir Arafat-style headgear that hung over his
forehead. He wore a brown gown that came down to his calves. Below the
gown you could see cream-colored pants, whose lapped side seams had
contrasting stitching, and a pair of brown Tuczek-toed shoes. His hands
were behind his back. When the corrections officers turned him around to
unlock his handcuffs, Kramer could see that he was holding the
Koran.</p>
<p>“Yo, Herbert!” The voice of a cheery little boy. It was one of the
children, up by the bar. The court officers glowered at him. A woman
back in the spectator benches yelled out, “You come here!” The little
boy laughed and ran back to where she was sitting. Herbert stopped and
turned toward the boy. His furious visage dissolved. He gave the boy a
wide-eyed smile of such warmth and love, it caused Kramer to swallow—and
to have another small spasm of the Doubts. Then Herbert sat down at the
defense table.</p>
<p>The clerk, Bruzzielli, said, “The People versus Herbert Cantrell,
Indictment Number 2—7—7—7.”</p>
<p>Herbert 92X was on his feet with his hand in the air. “He called me
out of my name again!”</p>
<p>Kovitsky leaned forward over his desk and said patiently, “Mr. 92X, I
explained this to you yesterday and the day before yesterday and the day
before that.”</p>
<p>“He called me out of my name!”</p>
<p>“I explained this to you, Mr. 92X. The clerk is bound by a legal
requirement. But in view of your evident intention to change your name,
which is your right, and for which legal process exists, the court is
content to refer to you as Herbert 92X for the purpose of these
proceedings. That okay with you?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Your Honor,” said Herbert 92X, still standing. He opened
the Koran and began riffling through the pages. “This morning, Your
Honor—”</p>
<p>“Can we proceed?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Judge. This morning—”</p>
<p>“Then sid-down!”</p>
<p>Herbert 92X stared at Kovitsky for a moment, then sank down into his
seat, still holding the Koran open. Somewhat sulkily he said: “You gonna
let me read?”</p>
<p>Kovitsky looked at his wristwatch and nodded yes and then swiveled
away about forty-five degrees and gazed at the wall above the empty jury
box.</p>
<p>Seated, Herbert 92X placed the Koran on the defense table and said:
“This morning, Your Honor, I shall read from Chapter 41, entitled ‘Are
Distinctly Explained, Revealed at Mecca’…in the name of the Most
Merciful God…This is a revelation from the Most Merciful…Warn them of
the day on which the enemies of God shall be gathered together unto
hellfire and shall march in distinct bands until, when they shall arrive
thereat, their ears and their eyes and their skins shall bear witness
against them…”</p>
<p>The court officers were rolling their eyes up in their heads. One of
them, Kaminsky, a real porker whose white uniform shirt barely contained
the roll of fat that rode on his gunbelt, let out an audible sigh and
spun 180 degrees on the soles of his big black leather cop shoes. The
prosecutors and defense lawyers regarded Kovitsky as a holy terror. But
the court officers were basic working-class line troops from the civil
service, and they regarded Kovitsky, like practically every other judge,
as outrageously and cravenly soft on criminals…letting this maniac sit
there and read from the Koran while his children ran around the
courtroom yelling, “Yo, Herbert!” Kovitsky’s reasoning seemed to be that
since Herbert 92X was a hothead, and since reading from the Koran cooled
him off, he was saving time in the long run.</p>
<p>“…turn away evil with that which is better, and behold, the man
between whom and thyself there was enmity shall become, as it were, thy
warmest friend, but none shall attain to…” In Herbert’s doleful orotund
reading, the words descended upon the room like a drizzle…Kramer’s mind
wandered…The girl with brown lipstick…Soon she would be coming out…The
very thought made him straighten himself up in his chair…He wished he
had taken a look at himself before he came into the courtroom…at his
hair, his tie…He tensed his neck and threw his head back…He was
convinced that women were impressed by men with huge sternocleidomastoid
muscles…He closed his eyes…</p>
<p>Herbert was still reading away, when Kovitsky broke in: “Thank you,
Mr. 92X, that concludes the reading from the Koran.”</p>
<p>“Say what? I’m not finished!”</p>
<p>“I said that concludes the reading from the Koran, Mr. 92X. DO I MAKE
MYSELF CLEAR?”</p>
<p>Kovitsky’s voice was suddenly so loud, people in the spectators’
section gasped.</p>
<p>Herbert jumped to his feet. “You’re violating my rights!” His chin
was jutted toward Kovitsky, and his eyes were on fire. He looked like a
rocket about to take off.</p>
<p>“Sid-down!”</p>
<p>“You’re violating my freedom of religion!”</p>
<p>“SID-DOWN, MR. 92X!”</p>
<p>“Mistrial!” shouted Herbert. “Mistrial!” Then he turned his fury on
Teskowitz, who was still seated beside him. “Get up on your feet, man!
This is a mistrial!”</p>
<p>Startled and a bit frightened, Teskowitz got up.</p>
<p>“Your Honor, my client—”</p>
<p>“I SAID SID-DOWN! BOTH A YOU!”</p>
<p>Both sat down.</p>
<p>“Now, Mr. 92X, this court has been very indulgent with you. Nobody is
violating your freedom of religion. The hour grows late, and we’ve got a
jury out there in a jury room that hasn’t been painted in twenty-five
years, and the time has come to conclude the reading of the Koran.”</p>
<p>“Say, conclude? You mean forbid! You’re violating my religious
rights!”</p>
<p>“The defendant will SHUDDUP! You don’t have the right to read the
Koran or the Talmud or the Bible or the words of the Angel Moroni, who
wrote the Book of Mormon, or any other spiritual tome, no matter how
divine—you don’t have the right to read it in this courtroom. Let me
remind you, sir, that this is not the Nation of Islam. We happen to live
in a republic, and in this republic there is a separation of church and
state. Do you understand? And this court is governed by the laws of that
republic, which are embodied in the Constitution of the United
States.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true!”</p>
<p>“What’s not true, Mr. 92X?”</p>
<p>“The separation of church and state. And I can prove it.”</p>
<p>“Whaddaya talking about, Mr. 92X?”</p>
<p>“Turn around! Look up on the wall!” Herbert was on his feet again,
pointing at the wall up above Kovitsky’s head. Kovitsky swiveled about
in his chair and looked up. Sure enough, incised in the wood paneling
were the words IN GOD WE TRUST.</p>
<p>“Church and state!” Herbert cried triumphantly. “You got it carved in
the wall over your head!”</p>
<p>Heh heh heggggh! A woman in the spectators’ section started laughing.
One of the court officers guffawed but turned his head before Kovitsky
could spot him. The clerk, Bruzzielli, couldn’t keep the grin off his
face. Patti Stullieri had her hand over her mouth. Kramer looked at Mike
Kovitsky, waiting for the explosion.</p>
<p>Instead, Kovitsky put a broad smile on his face. But his head was
lowered, and his irises were once again floating, bobbing on a turbulent
white sea.</p>
<p>“I can see you’re very observant, Mr. 92X, and I commend you for
that. And since you are so observant, you will also observe that I do
not have eyes in the back of my head. But I do have eyes in the front of
my head, and what they are looking at is a defendant who is on trial on
serious charges and faces the prospect of a prison term of twelve and a
half to twenty-five years, should he be found guilty by a jury of his
peers, and I want that jury to have the time to tend the scales of
justice…with CARE and FAIRNESS!…in determining the guilt or innocence of
that defendant. It’s a free country, Mr. 92X, and nobody can stop you
from believing in any deity you want. But as long as you’re in this
courtroom, you better believe in THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MIKE!”</p>
<p>Kovitsky said it with such ferocity that Herbert sat back down in his
chair. He didn’t say a word. Instead, he looked at Teskowitz. Teskowitz
merely shrugged and shook his head, as if to say, “That’s about the size
of it, Herbert.”</p>
<p>“Bring in the jury,” said Kovitsky.</p>
<p>A court officer opened the door that led to the jury room. Kramer sat
up straight in his chair at the prosecution table. He threw his head
back to bring out that powerful neck. The jurors began filing in…three
blacks, six Puerto Ricans…Where was she?…There she was, just coming
through the door!…Kramer didn’t even try to be subtle about it. He
stared right at her. That long lustrous dark brown hair, thick enough to
bury your head in, parted in the middle and pulled back to reveal that
perfect pure white forehead, those big eyes and luxurious lashes, and
those perfectly curved lips…with brown lipstick! Yes! She had it on
again! The brown lipstick, the color of caramel, hellish, rebellious,
perfectly elegant—</p>
<p>Kramer quickly surveyed the competition. The big clerk, Bruzzielli,
had his eyes pinned on her. The three court officers were staring at her
so hard Herbert could have taken a walk and they would have never
noticed. But Herbert himself was checking her out. Teskowitz was looking
at her. Sullivan, the court stenographer, sitting at the stenotype
machine, was looking at her. And Kovitsky! Him, too! Kramer had heard
stories about Kovitsky. He didn’t seem to be the type—but you never
knew.</p>
<p>To get to the jury box she had to file right past the prosecution
table. She had on a peach-colored sweater, fluffy, angora or mohair,
open up the front, and a ribbon-silk blouse with pink-and-yellow
stripes, beneath which Kramer could detect, or thought he could detect,
the voluptuous swell of her breasts. She wore a cream-colored gabardine
skirt, tight enough to bring out the curve of her thighs.</p>
<p>The hell of it was, practically every man on this side of the Bar of
Justice had a fighting chance. Well, not Herbert, but his wispy little
lawyer, Teskowitz, did. Even that fat court officer over there, that tub
Kaminsky. The number of court officers, defense lawyers, court clerks,
assistant district attorneys (oh yes!) and even judges (don’t rule them
out!) who have humped (that’s the word!) juicy little jurors in criminal
cases—God! if the press ever got hold of that story—but the press never
showed up in the courthouse in the Bronx.</p>
<p>First-time jurors in the criminal courts had a way of becoming
intoxicated by the romance, the raw voltage, of the evil world they were
now getting a box-seat look at, and the young women became the tipsiest
of all. To them the defendants were not chow; anything but. They were
desperadoes. And these cases were not pieces a shit. They were stark
dramas of the billion-footed city. And those with the courage to deal
with the desperadoes, wrestle with them, bridle them, were…real men…even
a court officer with a four-inch tube of fat riding up over his gunbelt.
But who was more manly than a young prosecutor, he who stood not ten
feet from the accused, with nothing between the two of them but thin
air, and hurled the charges of the People in his teeth?</p>
<p>Now she was in front of Kramer. She looked right back at him. Her
expression said nothing, but the look was so frank and forthright! And
she wore brown lipstick!</p>
<p>And then she was past him and going through the little gate into the
jury box. He couldn’t very well turn around and stare at her, but he was
tempted. How many of them had gone to the clerk, Bruzzielli, and looked
up her address and telephone numbers, at home and at work—as he had? The
clerk kept the slips with this information, the so-called ballots, in a
box on his desk in the courtroom, so that the court could get hold of
jurors quickly to inform them of changes in schedule or whatever. As the
prosecutor in the case, he, Kramer, could approach Bruzzielli and ask to
see the ballot for the girl with brown lipstick or any other juror with
a straight face. So could the defense attorney, Teskowitz. Kovitsky
could do it with a reasonably straight face, and of course Bruzzielli
himself could take a look anytime he felt like it. As for a court
officer like Kaminsky, for him to ask to take a look fell under the
category of…a wink and a favor. But hadn’t Kramer already seen Kaminsky
huddled with Bruzzielli over by Bruzzielli’s desk, deep in conversation
over…something? The thought that even such creatures as the fat Kaminsky
were after this…this flower…made Kramer more determined than ever. (He
would save her from the others.)</p>
<p>Miss Shelly Thomas of Riverdale.</p>
<p>She was from the very best part of Riverdale, a leafy suburb that was
geographically part of Westchester County but politically part of the
Bronx. There were still plenty of nice places to live in the North
Bronx. People in Riverdale generally had money, and they also had their
ways of getting off jury duty. They would pull every string that existed
before submitting to the prospect of coming down to the South Bronx, to
the 44th Precinct, to the island fortress of Gibraltar. The typical
Bronx jury was Puerto Rican and black, with a sprinkling of Jews and
Italians.</p>
<p>But every now and then a rare flower like Miss Shelly Thomas of
Riverdale landed in a jury box. What kind of name was that? Thomas was a
Waspy name. But there was Danny Thomas, and he was an Arab, a Lebanese
or something. Wasps were rare in the Bronx, except for those society
types who came up from Manhattan from time to time, in cars with
drivers, to do good deeds for the Ghetto Youth. The Big Brother
organization, the Episcopal Youth Service, the Daedalus Foundation—these
people showed up in Family Court, which was the court for criminals
under the age of seventeen. They had these names…Farnsworth, Fiske,
Phipps, Simpson, Thornton, Frost…and spotless intentions.</p>
<p>No, the chances that Miss Shelly Thomas might be a Wasp were remote.
But what was she? During jury selection he had elicited from her the
information that she was an art director, which apparently meant some
kind of designer, for the Prischker andandandand Bolka advertising
agency in Manhattan. To Kramer that suggested an inexpressibly glamorous
life. Beautiful creatures scampering back and forth to taped New Wave
music in an office with smooth white walls and glass brick…a sort of MTV
office…terrific lunches and dinners in restaurants with blond wood,
brass, indirect lighting, and frosted glass with chevron patterns on
it…baked quail with chanterelles on a bed of sweet potato and a ruff of
braised dandelion leaves…He could see it all. She was part of that life,
those places where the girls with brown lipstick go!…He had both of her
telephone numbers, at Prischker andandandand Bolka and at home.
Naturally he couldn’t do a thing while the trial was in progress. But
afterward…Miss Thomas? This is Lawrence Kramer. I’m—oh! you remember!
That’s terrific! Miss Thomas, I’m calling because every so often, after
one of these major cases is completed, I like to ascertain what it is
exactly that convinced the jury—a sudden stab of doubt…Suppose all that
happened was that she lost the case for him? Bronx juries were difficult
enough for a prosecutor as it was. They were drawn from the ranks of
those who know that in fact the police are capable of lying. Bronx
juries entertained a lot of doubts, both reasonable and unreasonable,
and black and Puerto Rican defendants who were stone guilty, guilty as
sin, did walk out of the fortress free as birds. Fortunately, Herbert
92X had shot a good man, a poor man, a family man from the ghetto. Thank
God for that! No juror who lived in the South Bronx was likely to have
sympathy for a foul-tempered nut case like Herbert. Only a wild card
like Miss Shelly Thomas of Riverdale was likely to have sympathy! A
well-educated young white woman, well-to-do, the artistic type, possibly
Jewish…She was just the type to turn idealistic on him and refuse to
convict Herbert on the grounds that he was black, romantic, and already
put upon by Fate. But he had to take that chance. He didn’t intend to
let her slip by. He needed her. He needed this particular triumph. In
this courtroom he was in the center of the arena. Her eyes had never
left him. He knew that. He could feel it. There was already something
between them…Larry Kramer and the girl with brown lipstick.</p>
<p>The regulars were amazed that day by the zeal and aggressiveness of
Assistant District Attorney Kramer in this nickel-and-dime Bronx
manslaughter case.</p>
<p>He started tearing into Herbert’s alibi witnesses.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it true, Mr. Williams, that this ’testimony’ of yours is part
of a cash transaction between you and the defendant?”</p>
<p>What the hell had gotten into Kramer? Teskowitz was beginning to get
furious. This sonofabitch Kramer was making him look bad! He was tearing
up the courtroom as if this piece a shit were the trial of the
century.</p>
<p>Kramer was oblivious of the wounded feelings of Teskowitz or Herbert
92X or any of the rest of them. There were only two people in that
cavernous mahogany hall, and they were Larry Kramer and the girl with
brown lipstick.</p>
<p>During the lunch recess Kramer went back to the office, as did Ray
Andriutti and Jimmy Caughey. An assistant district attorney who had a
trial going was entitled to lunch for himself and his witnesses courtesy
of the State of New York. In practice what this meant was that everybody
in the office stood to get a free lunch, and Andriutti and Caughey were
first in line. This pathetic little perk of the office was taken very
seriously. Bernie Fitzgibbon’s secretary, Gloria Dawson, ordered
sandwiches in from the deli. She got one, too. Kramer had a roast-beef
sandwich on an onion roll with mustard. The mustard came in a gelatinous
sealed plastic envelope that he had to open with his teeth. Ray
Andriutti was having a pepperoni hero with everything you could throw
into it thrown in, except for two enormous slices of dill pickle that
were lying on a piece of waxed paper on his desk. The smell of dill
brine filled the room. Kramer watched with disgusted fascination as
Andriutti lunged forward, over his desk, so that the pieces and the
juices that squirted overboard from the hero would fall on the desk
instead of his necktie. He did that with every bite; he lunged over the
desk, and bits of food and juice spilled from his maw, as if he were a
whale or a tuna. With each lunge his jaw shot past a plastic cup of
coffee which was on the desk. The coffee came from the Mr. Coffee. The
cup was so full, the coffee bulged with surface tension. All at once, it
began to overflow. A viscous yellow creek, no wider than a string, began
running down the side of the cup. Andriutti didn’t even notice. When the
filthy yellow flow reached the desktop, it created a pool about the size
of a Kennedy half-dollar. In no time, it was the size and color of a
dollar pancake. Soon the corners of two empty sugar packets were
submerged in the muck. Andriutti always loaded his coffee with Cremora
powder and sugar until it turned into a heavy sweet sick high-yellow
bile. His gaping jaws, with the pepperoni hero stuffed in, kept lunging
in front of the cup. The high point of the day! A free lunch!</p>
<p>And it doesn’t get any better, thought Kramer. It was not just young
assistant D.A.s like him and Andriutti and Jimmy Caughey. All over
Gibraltar, at this moment, from the lowest to the highest, the
representatives of the Power in the Bronx were holed up in their
offices, shell-backed, hunched over deli sandwiches, ordered in. Around
the big conference table in Abe Weiss’s office they were hunched over
their deli sandwiches, they being whomever Weiss thought he needed and
could get hold of that day in his crusade for publicity. Around the big
conference table in the office of the chief administrative judge for the
Criminal Division, Louis Mastroiani, they were hunched over their deli
sandwiches. Even when this worthy jurist happened to have a great
luminary in to visit, even when a United States senator came by, they
sat there hunched over their deli sandwiches, the luminary, too. You
could ascend to the very top of the criminal justice system in the Bronx
and eat deli sandwiches for lunch until the day you retired or died.</p>
<p>And why? Because they, the Power, the Power that ran the Bronx, were
terrified! They were terrified to go out into the heart of the Bronx at
high noon and have lunch in a restaurant! Terrified! And they ran the
place, the Bronx, a borough of 1.1 million souls! The heart of the Bronx
was now such a slum there was no longer anything even resembling a
businessman’s sit-down restaurant. But even if there were, what judge or
D.A. or assistant D.A., what court officer, even packing a .38, would
leave Gibraltar at lunchtime to get to it? First there was plain fear.
You walked from the Bronx County Building across the Grand Concourse and
down the slope of 161st Street to the Criminal Courts Building, a
distance of a block and a half, when you had to, but the prudent bearer
of the Power kept his wits about him. There were holdups on the crest of
the Grand Concourse, this great ornament of the Bronx, at 11:00 A.M. on
nice sunny days. And why not? More wallets and handbags were out on foot
in the middle of nice sunny days. You didn’t go beyond the Criminal
Courts Building at all. There were assistant D.A.s who had worked in
Gibraltar for ten years who couldn’t tell you, on a bet, what was on
162nd Street or 163rd Street, a block off the Grand Concourse. They had
never even been to the Bronx Museum of Art on 164th. But suppose you
were fearless in that sense. There remained another, subtler fear. You
were an alien on the streets of the 44th Precinct, and you knew that at
once, every time Fate led you into their territory. The looks! The
looks! The deadly mistrust! You were not wanted. You were not welcome.
Gibraltar and the Power belonged to the Bronx Democratic Party, to the
Jews and Italians, specifically, but the streets belonged to the
Lockwoods and the Arthur Riveras and the Jimmy Dollards and Otis
Blakemores and the Herbert 92X’s.</p>
<p>The thought depressed Kramer. Here they were, himself and Andriutti,
the Jew and the Italian, wolfing down their sandwiches, ordered in,
inside the fortress, inside the limestone rock. And for what? What did
they have to look forward to? How could this setup survive long enough
for them to reach the top of the pyramid, even assuming it was worth
reaching? Sooner or later the Puerto Ricans and the blacks would pull
themselves together politically, and they would seize even Gibraltar and
everything in it. And meantime, what would he be doing? He’d be stirring
the muck…stirring the muck…until they took the stick away from him.</p>
<p>Just then the telephone rang.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Bernie?”</p>
<p>“You got the wrong extension,” said Kramer, “but I don’t think he’s
here anyway.”</p>
<p>“Who is this?”</p>
<p>“Kramer.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I remember you. This is Detective Martin.”</p>
<p>Kramer didn’t really remember Martin, but the name and the voice
triggered a vaguely unpleasant recollection.</p>
<p>“What can I do for you?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m over here at Lincoln Hospital with my partner, Goldberg,
and we got this half-a-homicide case, and I thought we ought to tell
Bernie about it.”</p>
<p>“Did you talk to somebody here a couple hours ago? Ray
Andriutti?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Kramer sighed. “Well, Bernie’s still not back. I don’t know where he
is.”</p>
<p>A pause. “Shit. Maybe you can pass this along to him.”</p>
<p>Another sigh. “Okay.”</p>
<p>“There’s this kid, Henry Lamb, L-A-M-B, eighteen years old, and he’s
in the intensive-care unit. He came in here last night with a broken
wrist. Okay? When he came in here, at least from what’s on this sheet of
paper, he didn’t say nothing about getting hit by a car. It just says he
fell. Okay? So they fixed up the broken wrist in the emergency room, and
they sent him home. This morning the kid’s mother, she brings him back
in here, and he’s got a concussion, and he goes into a coma, and now
they classify him as a likely-to-die. Okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“The kid was in the coma by the time they called us, but there’s this
nurse here that says he told his mother he was hit by a car, a Mercedes,
and the car left the scene, and he got a partial license number.”</p>
<p>“Any witnesses?”</p>
<p>“No. This is all from the nurse. We can’t even find the mother.”</p>
<p>“Is this supposed to be two accidents or one accident? You said a
broken wrist and a concussion?”</p>
<p>“One, according to this nurse, who’s all excited and breaking my
balls about a hit-and-run. It’s all fucked-up, but I just thought I’d
tell Bernie, in case he wants to do anything about it.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll tell him, but I don’t see what it’s got to do with us.
There’s no witness, no driver—the guy is in a coma—but I’ll tell
him.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know. If we find the mother and get anything, tell Bernie
I’ll call him.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>After he hung up, Kramer scribbled a note to Bernie Fitzgibbon. The
victim neglected to mention he was hit by a car. A typical Bronx case.
Another piece a shit.</p>
