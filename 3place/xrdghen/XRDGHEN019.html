<h4 id="donkey-loyalty">19. Donkey Loyalty</h4>
<p>First thing monday morning Kramer and Bernie Fitzgibbon were summoned
into Abe Weiss’s office. Milt Lubell was there, too. Kramer could tell
that his status had improved over the weekend. Weiss now called him
Larry instead of Kramer and didn’t direct every comment about the Lamb
case to Bernie, as if he, Kramer, were nothing but Bernie’s foot
soldier.</p>
<p>But Weiss was looking at Bernie when he said, “I don’t wanna have to
futz around with this thing if I don’t have to. Have we got enough to
bring in this guy McCoy or not?”</p>
<p>“We got enough, Abe,” said Fitzgibbon, “but I’m not completely happy
with it. We got this character Auburn who identifies McCoy as the guy
who was driving the car that hit Lamb, and we got the garage attendant
who says McCoy had his car out at the time the thing happened, and
Martin and Goldberg found the gypsy cab operator, Brill, who verifies
that Auburn used one of his cabs that evening. But they haven’t found
the driver, this Curly Kale”—he rolled his eyes and sucked in his
breath, as if to say, “These people and their names”—“and I think we
oughta talk to him first.”</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Weiss.</p>
<p>“Because there’s certain things that don’t make sense, and Auburn’s a
fucking lowlife drug dealer who’s out from under his rock. I’d still
like to know why Lamb didn’t say anything about being hit by a car when
he first went to the hospital. I’d like to know what went on in that
cab, and I’d like to know if Auburn actually took the kid to the
hospital. I’d like to know a little more about Auburn, too. You know,
him and Lamb ain’t the types who go walking over to the Texas Fried
Chicken together. I gather Lamb is a kinda good-doing boy, and Auburn’s
a player.”</p>
<p>Kramer felt an odd passion rising in his breast. He wanted to defend
the honor of Roland Auburn. Yes! Defend him!</p>
<p>Weiss waved his hand in a gesture of dismissal. “Loose ends is what
that sounds like to me, Bernie. I don’t know why we can’t bring McCoy in
and book him and then tie up the loose ends. Everybody takes this ‘we’re
investigating’ business to be a stalling tactic.”</p>
<p>“A couple more days ain’t gonna matter, Abe. McCoy’s not going
anywhere, and Auburn certainly ain’t going anywhere.”</p>
<p>Kramer saw an opening and, buoyed by his new status, plunged in: “We
could have a problem there, Bernie. It’s true, Auburn”—he started to say
isn’t but switched to ain’t—“ain’t going anywhere, but I think we ought
to use him quickly. He probably thinks he’s getting out on bail any
minute. We oughta get the guy in front of a grand jury as soon as we
can, if we’re gonna use him.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that,” said Fitzgibbon. “He ain’t brilliant, but
he knows he’s got a choice between three years in jail and no years in
jail. He’s not gonna shut up on us.”</p>
<p>“That’s the deal we made?” asked Weiss. “Auburn gets nothing?”</p>
<p>“That’s the way it’ll wind up. We got to dismiss the indictment and
knock the charge down to misdemeanor possession, misdemeanor sale.”</p>
<p>“Shit,” said Weiss. “I wish we hadn’ta moved so fast with the
sonofabitch. I don’t like to dismiss grand-jury indictments.”</p>
<p>“Abe,” said Fitzgibbon, smiling, “you said it, I didn’t! All I’m
telling you is, take it a little slower. I’d feel a lot better if we had
something else to nail down what he says.”</p>
<p>Kramer couldn’t hold back. “I don’t know—what he says stands up
pretty well. He was telling me things he had to be there to know about.
He knew the color of the car, the number of doors—he knew it was a
sports model. He knew McCoy’s first name. He heard it as Shuhmun, but I
mean, that’s pretty close. There’s no way he could’ve dreamed up all
that.”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying he wasn’t there, Larry, and I’m not saying we don’t
use him. We use him. I’m just saying he’s a slimeball and we ought to be
careful.”</p>
<p>Slimeball? This is my witness you’re talking about! “I don’t know,
Bernie,” he said. “From what I’ve been able to find out so far, he’s not
all that bad a kid. I got hold of a probation report. He’s not a genius,
but he’s never been around anybody who’s ever made him use his head.
He’s third-generation welfare, his mother was fifteen when he was born,
and she’s had two other kids by different fathers, and now she’s living
with one of Roland’s buddies, a twenty-year-old kid, just a year older
than Roland. He’s moved right in there to the apartment, along with
Roland and one of the other two kids. I mean, Jesus Christ, can you
imagine? I think I’d have a worse record than him. I doubt that he’s
ever known a relative that lived outside the projects.”</p>
<p>Bernie Fitzgibbons was now smiling at him. Kramer was startled but
plowed on.</p>
<p>“Another thing I found out about him, he has some talent. His
probation officer showed me some pictures he’s done. They’re really
interesting. They’re these whaddayacall’em…”</p>
<p>“Collages?” said Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” said Kramer. “Collages, with these sort of silver…”</p>
<p>“Crushed aluminum foil for the skies?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! You’ve seen ’em! Where’d you see ’em?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen Auburn’s, but I’ve seen a lot like it. It’s jailhouse
art.”</p>
<p>“Whaddaya mean?”</p>
<p>“You see it all the time. They do these pictures in jail. These
figures, kind of like cartoon figures, right? And then they fill in the
background with crushed Reynolds Wrap?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>“I see that crap all the time. Must be two or three lawyers come in
here every year with these tinfoil pictures, telling me I’m keeping
Michelangelo behind bars.”</p>
<p>“Well, that may be,” said Kramer. “But I’d say this kid has some real
talent.”</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon said nothing. He just smiled. And now Kramer knew what the
smile was all about. Bernie thought he was trying to light up his
witness. Kramer knew all about that—but this was different! Lighting up
the witness was a common psychological phenomenon among prosecutors. In
a criminal case, your star witness was likely to be from the same milieu
as the defendant and might very well have a record himself. He was not
likely to be known as a pillar of probity—and yet he was the only star
witness you had. At this point you were likely to feel the urge to light
him up with the lamp of truth and credibility. But this was not merely a
matter of improving his reputation in the eyes of a judge and jury. You
felt the urge to sanitize him for yourself. You needed to believe that
what you were doing with this person—namely, using him to pack another
person off to jail—was not only effective but right. This worm, this
germ, this punk, this erstwhile asshole was now your comrade, your point
man in the battle of good against evil, and you yourself wanted to
believe that a light shone round about this…organism, this former vermin
from under the rock, now a put-upon and misunderstood youth.</p>
<p>He knew all about that—but Roland Auburn was different!</p>
<p>“All right,” said Abe Weiss, putting an end to the aesthetic debate
with another wave of his hand. “It don’t matter. I got to make a
decision, and I’ve made a decision. We got enough. We’re bringing McCoy
in. We bring him in tomorrow morning, and we make the announcement.
Tuesday’s a good day?”</p>
<p>He looked at Milt Lubell when he said that. Lubell nodded sagely.
“Tuesday and Wednesday are the best. Tuesday and Wednesday.” He turned
to Bernie Fitzgibbon. “Mondays are lousy. All people do on Mondays is
read about sports all day and watch ball games at night.”</p>
<p>But Fitzgibbon was looking at Weiss. Finally he shrugged and said,
“Okay, Abe. I can live with that. But if we’re gonna do it tomorrow, I
better call Tommy Killian right now, before he goes into court, to make
sure he can produce his man.”</p>
<p>Weiss motioned toward the small table and the telephone at the end of
the room, beyond the conference table, and Fitzgibbon headed down there.
While Fitzgibbon was on the telephone, Weiss said, “Where are those
pictures, Milt?”</p>
<p>Milt Lubell dug through a pile of papers in his lap and came up with
several pages from a magazine and handed them to Weiss.</p>
<p>“What’s the name a this magazine, Milt?”</p>
<p>“Architectural Digest.”</p>
<p>“Look at this.” The next thing Kramer knew, Weiss was leaning across
the desk and handing them to him. He felt tremendously flattered. He
studied the pages…the creamiest paper imaginable…lush photographs in
color with detail so sharp it made you blink…McCoy’s apartment…A sea of
marble led up to a great curved staircase with a dark wood
balustrade…Dark wood everywhere and an ornate table with about a
truckload of flowers rising up from out of a big vase…It was the hall
Martin had been talking about. It looked big enough to put three of
Kramer’s 88-a-month ant colony in, and it was only a hall. He had heard
that there were people who lived like this in New York…Another room…more
dark wood…Must be the living room…So big, there were three or four
clumps of heavy furniture in it…the kind of room you walk into, and you
turn your voice down to a whisper…Another picture…a close-up of some
carved wood, a lustrous reddish-tan wood, all these figures in suits and
hats walking this way and that at odd angles in front of buildings…And
now Weiss was leaning across his desk and pointing at the picture.</p>
<p>“Get a loada that,” he said. “ ‘Wall Street,’ it’s called, by Wing
Wong or some goddamned person, ‘Hong Kong’s master wood carver.’ Iddn’at
what it says there? It’s on the wall of ‘the library.’ I like that.”</p>
<p>Now Kramer could see what Martin had been talking about. ‘The
library’…The Wasps…Thirty-eight…only six years older than he was…They
were left all this money by their parents, and they lived in Fairyland.
Well, this one was heading for a collision with the real world.</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon returned from the other end of the room.</p>
<p>“You talk to Tommy?” asked Weiss.</p>
<p>“Yeah. He’ll have his man ready.”</p>
<p>“Take a look at this,” said Weiss, motioning toward the magazine
pages. Kramer handed them to Fitzgibbon. “McCoy’s apartment,” said
Weiss.</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon took a quick look at the pictures and handed them back to
Kramer.</p>
<p>“You ever seen anything like it?” asked Weiss. “His wife was the
decorator. Am I right, Milt?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she’s one a these social decorators,” said Lubell, “one a
these rich women who decorate places for other rich women. They run
articles about them in New York magazine.”</p>
<p>Weiss kept looking at Fitzgibbon, but Fitzgibbon said nothing. Then
Weiss opened his eyes wide in a look of revelation. “Can you picture it,
Bernie?”</p>
<p>“Picture what?”</p>
<p>“Well, here’s the way I see it,” said Weiss. “What I think would be a
good idea, to stop all this bullshit about white justice and
Johannesbronx and all that crap, is we arrest him in his apartment. I
think that would be a hell of a thing. You wanna tell the people of this
borough that the law is no respecter of persons, you arrest a guy from
Park Avenue the same way you arrest José García or Tyrone Smith. You go
into their fucking apartment, am I right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Fitzgibbon, “because they ain’t coming in any other
way.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point. We have an obligation to the people of this
borough. This office is being held up to them in a very bad light, and
this’ll put an end to that.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that kinda rough, taking a guy in his home to make a
point?”</p>
<p>“There’s no wonderful way to get arrested, Bernie.”</p>
<p>“Well, we can’t do that,” said Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because I just told Tommy we wouldn’t do it that way. I told him he
could surrender McCoy himself.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m sorry, but you shouldna done that, Bernie. We can’t
guarantee anybody we’ll give his client special treatment. You know
that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that, Abe. I gave him my word.”</p>
<p>Kramer looked at Weiss. Kramer knew the Donkey had now dug in, but
did Weiss? Apparently not.</p>
<p>“Look, Bernie, you just tell Tommy I overruled you, okay? You can
blame it on me. I’ll take all the heat for it. We’ll make it up to
Tommy.”</p>
<p>“Negative,” said Fitzgibbon. “You’re not gonna have to take the heat,
Abe, because it’s not gonna happen. I gave Tommy my word. It’s a
contract.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, sometimes you just gotta—”</p>
<p>“Oongots, Abe, it’s a contract.”</p>
<p>Kramer kept his eyes on Weiss. Bernie’s repetition of the word
contract had gotten to him. Kramer could see it. Weiss had come to a
dead stop. Now he knew he was up against that obstinate Irish code of
loyalty. Silently Kramer begged Weiss to throw his subordinate aside.
Donkey loyalty! It was obscene! Why should he, Kramer, have to suffer
for the sake of the fraternal solidarity of the Irish? A highly
publicized arrest of this Wall Street investment banker in his
apartment—it happened to be a brilliant idea! Demonstrate the
evenhandedness of justice in the Bronx—absolutely! Assistant District
Attorney Lawrence Kramer—the Times, the News, the Post, The City Light,
Channel 1, and the rest of them would know his name by heart soon
enough! Why should Abe Weiss cave in to the code of these Harps? And yet
he knew he would. He could see it in his face. It wasn’t just Bernie
Fitzgibbon’s black Irish toughness, either. It was also that word
contract. That cut straight to the soul of every lifer in this business.
At the Favor Bank all due bills had to be redeemed. That was the law of
the criminal-justice system, and Abe Weiss was nothing if not a creature
of the system.</p>
<p>“Well, shit, Bernie,” said Weiss, “whudja do that for? F’r
Chrissake…”</p>
<p>The standoff was over.</p>
<p>“Believe me, Abe, you’re gonna look better this way. They can’t say
you gave in to the passions of the crowd.”</p>
<p>“Ummmm. Well, next time don’t make these commitments without running
them by me.”</p>
<p>Bernie just looked at him and gave him a tiny smile that as much as
said, once more, “Oongots.”</p>
