<h4 id="chapter-xxvii-civil-wars-reign-of-theodosius.">Chapter XXVII:
Civil Wars, Reign Of Theodosius.</h4>
<p>Part V.</p>
<p>After the defeat and death of the tyrant of Gaul, the Roman world was
in the possession of Theodosius. He derived from the choice of Gratian
his honorable title to the provinces of the East: he had acquired the
West by the right of conquest; and the three years which he spent in
Italy were usefully employed to restore the authority of the laws, and
to correct the abuses which had prevailed with impunity under the
usurpation of Maximus, and the minority of Valentinian. The name of
Valentinian was regularly inserted in the public acts: but the tender
age, and doubtful faith, of the son of Justina, appeared to require the
prudent care of an orthodox guardian; and his specious ambition might
have excluded the unfortunate youth, without a struggle, and almost
without a murmur, from the administration, and even from the
inheritance, of the empire. If Theodosius had consulted the rigid maxims
of interest and policy, his conduct would have been justified by his
friends; but the generosity of his behavior on this memorable occasion
has extorted the applause of his most inveterate enemies. He seated
Valentinian on the throne of Milan; and, without stipulating any present
or future advantages, restored him to the absolute dominion of all the
provinces, from which he had been driven by the arms of Maximus. To the
restitution of his ample patrimony, Theodosius added the free and
generous gift of the countries beyond the Alps, which his successful
valor had recovered from the assassin of Gratian. ^101 Satisfied with
the glory which he had acquired, by revenging the death of his
benefactor, and delivering the West from the yoke of tyranny, the
emperor returned from Milan to Constantinople; and, in the peaceful
possession of the East, insensibly relapsed into his former habits of
luxury and indolence. Theodosius discharged his obligation to the
brother, he indulged his conjugal tenderness to the sister, of
Valentinian; and posterity, which admires the pure and singular glory of
his elevation, must applaud his unrivalled generosity in the use of
victory.</p>
<p>[Footnote 101: It is the niggard praise of Zosimus himself, (l. iv.
p. 267.) Augustin says, with some happiness of expression, Valentinianum
…. misericordissima veneratione restituit.]</p>
<p>The empress Justina did not long survive her return to Italy; and,
though she beheld the triumph of Theodosius, she was not allowed to
influence the government of her son. ^102 The pernicious attachment to
the Arian sect, which Valentinian had imbibed from her example and
instructions, was soon erased by the lessons of a more orthodox
education. His growing zeal for the faith of Nice, and his filial
reverence for the character and authority of Ambrose, disposed the
Catholics to entertain the most favorable opinion of the virtues of the
young emperor of the West. ^103 They applauded his chastity and
temperance, his contempt of pleasure, his application to business, and
his tender affection for his two sisters; which could not, however,
seduce his impartial equity to pronounce an unjust sentence against the
meanest of his subjects. But this amiable youth, before he had
accomplished the twentieth year of his age, was oppressed by domestic
treason; and the empire was again involved in the horrors of a civil
war. Arbogastes, ^104 a gallant soldier of the nation of the Franks,
held the second rank in the service of Gratian. On the death of his
master he joined the standard of Theodosius; contributed, by his valor
and military conduct, to the destruction of the tyrant; and was
appointed, after the victory, master-general of the armies of Gaul. His
real merit, and apparent fidelity, had gained the confidence both of the
prince and people; his boundless liberality corrupted the allegiance of
the troops; and, whilst he was universally esteemed as the pillar of the
state, the bold and crafty Barbarian was secretly determined either to
rule, or to ruin, the empire of the West. The important commands of the
army were distributed among the Franks; the creatures of Arbogastes were
promoted to all the honors and offices of the civil government; the
progress of the conspiracy removed every faithful servant from the
presence of Valentinian; and the emperor, without power and without
intelligence, insensibly sunk into the precarious and dependent
condition of a captive. ^105 The indignation which he expressed, though
it might arise only from the rash and impatient temper of youth, may be
candidly ascribed to the generous spirit of a prince, who felt that he
was not unworthy to reign. He secretly invited the archbishop of Milan
to undertake the office of a mediator; as the pledge of his sincerity,
and the guardian of his safety. He contrived to apprise the emperor of
the East of his helpless situation, and he declared, that, unless
Theodosius could speedily march to his assistance, he must attempt to
escape from the palace, or rather prison, of Vienna in Gaul, where he
had imprudently fixed his residence in the midst of the hostile faction.
But the hopes of relief were distant, and doubtful: and, as every day
furnished some new provocation, the emperor, without strength or
counsel, too hastily resolved to risk an immediate contest with his
powerful general. He received Arbogastes on the throne; and, as the
count approached with some appearance of respect, delivered to him a
paper, which dismissed him from all his employments. “My authority,“
replied Arbogastes, with insulting coolness, “does not depend on the
smile or the frown of a monarch;“ and he contemptuously threw the paper
on the ground. The indignant monarch snatched at the sword of one of the
guards, which he struggled to draw from its scabbard; and it was not
without some degree of violence that he was prevented from using the
deadly weapon against his enemy, or against himself. A few days after
this extraordinary quarrel, in which he had exposed his resentment and
his weakness, the unfortunate Valentinian was found strangled in his
apartment; and some pains were employed to disguise the manifest guilt
of Arbogastes, and to persuade the world, that the death of the young
emperor had been the voluntary effect of his own despair. ^106 His body
was conducted with decent pomp to the sepulchre of Milan; and the
archbishop pronounced a funeral oration to commemorate his virtues and
his misfortunes. ^107 On this occasion the humanity of Ambrose tempted
him to make a singular breach in his theological system; and to comfort
the weeping sisters of Valentinian, by the firm assurance, that their
pious brother, though he had not received the sacrament of baptism, was
introduced, without difficulty, into the mansions of eternal bliss.
^108</p>
<p>[Footnote 102: Sozomen, l. vii. c. 14. His chronology is very
irregular.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 103: See Ambrose, (tom. ii. de Obit. Valentinian. c. 15,
andandandandc. p. 1178. c. 36, andandandandc. p. 1184.) When the young
emperor gave an entertainment, he fasted himself; he refused to see a
handsome actress, andandandandc. Since he ordered his wild beasts to to
be killed, it is ungenerous in Philostor (l. xi. c. 1) to reproach him
with the love of that amusement.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 104: Zosimus (l. iv. p. 275) praises the enemy of
Theodosius. But he is detested by Socrates (l. v. c. 25) and Orosius,
(l. vii. c. 35.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 105: Gregory of Tours (l. ii. c. 9, p. 165, in the second
volume of the Historians of France) has preserved a curious fragment of
Sulpicius Alexander, an historian far more valuable than himself.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 106: Godefroy (Dissertat. ad. Philostorg. p. 429 - 434) has
diligently collected all the circumstances of the death of Valentinian
II. The variations, and the ignorance, of contemporary writers, prove
that it was secret.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 107: De Obitu Valentinian. tom. ii. p. 1173 - 1196. He is
forced to speak a discreet and obscure language: yet he is much bolder
than any layman, or perhaps any other ecclesiastic, would have dared to
be.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 108: See c. 51, p. 1188, c. 75, p. 1193. Dom Chardon,
(Hist. des Sacramens, tom. i. p. 86,) who owns that St. Ambrose most
strenuously maintains the indispensable necessity of baptism, labors to
reconcile the contradiction.]</p>
<p>The prudence of Arbogastes had prepared the success of his ambitious
designs: and the provincials, in whose breast every sentiment of
patriotism or loyalty was extinguished, expected, with tame resignation,
the unknown master, whom the choice of a Frank might place on the
Imperial throne. But some remains of pride and prejudice still opposed
the elevation of Arbogastes himself; and the judicious Barbarian thought
it more advisable to reign under the name of some dependent Roman. He
bestowed the purple on the rhetorician Eugenius; ^109 whom he had
already raised from the place of his domestic secretary to the rank of
master of the offices. In the course, both of his private and public
service, the count had always approved the attachment and abilities of
Eugenius; his learning and eloquence, supported by the gravity of his
manners, recommended him to the esteem of the people; and the reluctance
with which he seemed to ascend the throne, may inspire a favorable
prejudice of his virtue and moderation. The ambassadors of the new
emperor were immediately despatched to the court of Theodosius, to
communicate, with affected grief, the unfortunate accident of the death
of Valentinian; and, without mentioning the name of Arbogastes, to
request, that the monarch of the East would embrace, as his lawful
colleague, the respectable citizen, who had obtained the unanimous
suffrage of the armies and provinces of the West. ^110 Theodosius was
justly provoked, that the perfidy of a Barbarian, should have destroyed,
in a moment, the labors, and the fruit, of his former victory; and he
was excited by the tears of his beloved wife, ^111 to revenge the fate
of her unhappy brother, and once more to assert by arms the violated
majesty of the throne. But as the second conquest of the West was a task
of difficulty and danger, he dismissed, with splendid presents, and an
ambiguous answer, the ambassadors of Eugenius; and almost two years were
consumed in the preparations of the civil war. Before he formed any
decisive resolution, the pious emperor was anxious to discover the will
of Heaven; and as the progress of Christianity had silenced the oracles
of Delphi and Dodona, he consulted an Egyptian monk, who possessed, in
the opinion of the age, the gift of miracles, and the knowledge of
futurity. Eutropius, one of the favorite eunuchs of the palace of
Constantinople, embarked for Alexandria, from whence he sailed up the
Nile, as far as the city of Lycopolis, or of Wolves, in the remote
province of Thebais. ^112 In the neighborhood of that city, and on the
summit of a lofty mountain, the holy John ^113 had constructed, with his
own hands, an humble cell, in which he had dwelt above fifty years,
without opening his door, without seeing the face of a woman, and
without tasting any food that had been prepared by fire, or any human
art. Five days of the week he spent in prayer and meditation; but on
Saturdays and Sundays he regularly opened a small window, and gave
audience to the crowd of suppliants who successively flowed from every
part of the Christian world. The eunuch of Theodosius approached the
window with respectful steps, proposed his questions concerning the
event of the civil war, and soon returned with a favorable oracle, which
animated the courage of the emperor by the assurance of a bloody, but
infallible victory. ^114 The accomplishment of the prediction was
forwarded by all the means that human prudence could supply. The
industry of the two master-generals, Stilicho and Timasius, was directed
to recruit the numbers, and to revive the discipline of the Roman
legions. The formidable troops of Barbarians marched under the ensigns
of their national chieftains. The Iberian, the Arab, and the Goth, who
gazed on each other with mutual astonishment, were enlisted in the
service of the same prince; ^* and the renowned Alaric acquired, in the
school of Theodosius, the knowledge of the art of war, which he
afterwards so fatally exerted for the destruction of Rome. ^115</p>
<p>[Footnote 109: Quem sibi Germanus famulam delegerat exul, is the
contemptuous expression of Claudian, (iv. Cons. Hon. 74.) Eugenius
professed Christianity; but his secret attachment to Paganism (Sozomen,
l. vii. c. 22, Philostorg. l. xi. c. 2) is probable in a grammarian, and
would secure the friendship of Zosimus, (l. iv. p. 276, 277.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 110: Zosimus (l. iv. p. 278) mentions this embassy; but he
is diverted by another story from relating the event.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 111: Zosim. l. iv. p. 277. He afterwards says (p. 280) that
Galla died in childbed; and intimates, that the affliction of her
husband was extreme but short.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 112: Lycopolis is the modern Siut, or Osiot, a town of
Said, about the size of St. Denys, which drives a profitable trade with
the kingdom of Senaar, and has a very convenient fountain, “cujus potu
signa virgini tatis eripiuntur.“ See D’Anville, Description de l’Egypte,
p. 181 Abulfeda, Descript. Egypt. p. 14, and the curious Annotations,
p. 25, 92, of his editor Michaelis.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 113: The Life of John of Lycopolis is described by his two
friends, Rufinus (l. ii. c. i. p. 449) and Palladius, (Hist. Lausiac.
c. 43, p. 738,) in Rosweyde’s great Collection of the Vitae Patrum.
Tillemont (Mem. Eccles. tom. x. p. 718, 720) has settled the
chronology.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 114: Sozomen, l. vii. c. 22. Claudian (in Eutrop. l. i.
312) mentions the eunuch’s journey; but he most contemptuously derides
the Egyptian dreams, and the oracles of the Nile.]</p>
<p>[Footnote *: Gibbon has embodied the picturesque verses of Claudian:
- …. Nec tantis dissona linguis Turba, nec armorum cultu diversion
unquam]</p>
<p>[Footnote 115: Zosimus, l. iv. p. 280. Socrates, l. vii. 10. Alaric
himself (de Bell. Getico, 524) dwells with more complacency on his early
exploits against the Romans.</p>
<p>…. Tot Augustos Hebro qui teste fugavi.</p>
<p>Yet his vanity could scarcely have proved this plurality of flying
emperors.]</p>
<p>The emperor of the West, or, to speak more properly, his general
Arbogastes, was instructed by the misconduct and misfortune of Maximus,
how dangerous it might prove to extend the line of defence against a
skilful antagonist, who was free to press, or to suspend, to contract,
or to multiply, his various methods of attack. ^116 Arbogastes fixed his
station on the confines of Italy; the troops of Theodosius were
permitted to occupy, without resistance, the provinces of Pannonia, as
far as the foot of the Julian Alps; and even the passes of the mountains
were negligently, or perhaps artfully, abandoned to the bold invader. He
descended from the hills, and beheld, with some astonishment, the
formidable camp of the Gauls and Germans, that covered with arms and
tents the open country which extends to the walls of Aquileia, and the
banks of the Frigidus, ^117 or Cold River. ^118 This narrow theatre of
the war, circumscribed by the Alps and the Adriatic, did not allow much
room for the operations of military skill; the spirit of Arbogastes
would have disdained a pardon; his guilt extinguished the hope of a
negotiation; and Theodosius was impatient to satisfy his glory and
revenge, by the chastisement of the assassins of Valentinian. Without
weighing the natural and artificial obstacles that opposed his efforts,
the emperor of the East immediately attacked the fortifications of his
rivals, assigned the post of honorable danger to the Goths, and
cherished a secret wish, that the bloody conflict might diminish the
pride and numbers of the conquerors. Ten thousand of those auxiliaries,
and Bacurius, general of the Iberians, died bravely on the field of
battle. But the victory was not purchased by their blood; the Gauls
maintained their advantage; and the approach of night protected the
disorderly flight, or retreat, of the troops of Theodosius. The emperor
retired to the adjacent hills; where he passed a disconsolate night,
without sleep, without provisions, and without hopes; ^119 except that
strong assurance, which, under the most desperate circumstances, the
independent mind may derive from the contempt of fortune and of life.
The triumph of Eugenius was celebrated by the insolent and dissolute joy
of his camp; whilst the active and vigilant Arbogastes secretly detached
a considerable body of troops to occupy the passes of the mountains, and
to encompass the rear of the Eastern army. The dawn of day discovered to
the eyes of Theodosius the extent and the extremity of his danger; but
his apprehensions were soon dispelled, by a friendly message from the
leaders of those troops who expressed their inclination to desert the
standard of the tyrant. The honorable and lucrative rewards, which they
stipulated as the price of their perfidy, were granted without
hesitation; and as ink and paper could not easily be procured, the
emperor subscribed, on his own tablets, the ratification of the treaty.
The spirit of his soldiers was revived by this seasonable reenforcement;
and they again marched, with confidence, to surprise the camp of a
tyrant, whose principal officers appeared to distrust, either the
justice or the success of his arms. In the heat of the battle, a violent
tempest, ^120 such as is often felt among the Alps, suddenly arose from
the East. The army of Theodosius was sheltered by their position from
the impetuosity of the wind, which blew a cloud of dust in the faces of
the enemy, disordered their ranks, wrested their weapons from their
hands, and diverted, or repelled, their ineffectual javelins. This
accidental advantage was skilfully improved, the violence of the storm
was magnified by the superstitious terrors of the Gauls; and they
yielded without shame to the invisible powers of heaven, who seemed to
militate on the side of the pious emperor. His victory was decisive; and
the deaths of his two rivals were distinguished only by the difference
of their characters. The rhetorician Eugenius, who had almost acquired
the dominion of the world, was reduced to implore the mercy of the
conqueror; and the unrelenting soldiers separated his head from his body
as he lay prostrate at the feet of Theodosius. Arbogastes, after the
loss of a battle, in which he had discharged the duties of a soldier and
a general, wandered several days among the mountains. But when he was
convinced that his cause was desperate, and his escape impracticable,
the intrepid Barbarian imitated the example of the ancient Romans, and
turned his sword against his own breast. The fate of the empire was
determined in a narrow corner of Italy; and the legitimate successor of
the house of Valentinian embraced the archbishop of Milan, and
graciously received the submission of the provinces of the West. Those
provinces were involved in the guilt of rebellion; while the inflexible
courage of Ambrose alone had resisted the claims of successful
usurpation. With a manly freedom, which might have been fatal to any
other subject, the archbishop rejected the gifts of Eugenius, ^*
declined his correspondence, and withdrew himself from Milan, to avoid
the odious presence of a tyrant, whose downfall he predicted in discreet
and ambiguous language. The merit of Ambrose was applauded by the
conqueror, who secured the attachment of the people by his alliance with
the church; and the clemency of Theodosius is ascribed to the humane
intercession of the archbishop of Milan. ^121</p>
<p>[Footnote 116: Claudian (in iv. Cons. Honor. 77, andandandandc.)
contrasts the military plans of the two usurpers: -</p>
<p>…. Novitas audere priorem Suadebat; cautumque dabant exempla

c. 188.)]</p>

<p>These famous lines of Claudian (in iii. Cons. Honor. 93,
andandandandc. A.D. 396) are alleged by his contemporaries, Augustin and
Orosius; who suppress the Pagan deity of Aeolus, and add some
circumstances from the information of eye-witnesses. Within four months
after the victory, it was compared by Ambrose to the miraculous
victories of Moses and Joshua.]</p>
<p>[Footnote *: Arbogastes and his emperor had openly espoused the Pagan
party, according to Ambrose and Augustin. See Le Beau, v. 40. Beugnot
(Histoire de la Destruction du Paganisme) is more full, and perhaps
somewhat fanciful, on this remarkable reaction in favor of Paganism, but
compare p 116. - M.]</p>

<p>After the defeat of Eugenius, the merit, as well as the authority, of
Theodosius was cheerfully acknowledged by all the inhabitants of the
Roman world. The experience of his past conduct encouraged the most
pleasing expectations of his future reign; and the age of the emperor,
which did not exceed fifty years, seemed to extend the prospect of the
public felicity. His death, only four months after his victory, was
considered by the people as an unforeseen and fatal event, which
destroyed, in a moment, the hopes of the rising generation. But the
indulgence of ease and luxury had secretly nourished the principles of
disease. ^122 The strength of Theodosius was unable to support the
sudden and violent transition from the palace to the camp; and the
increasing symptoms of a dropsy announced the speedy dissolution of the
emperor. The opinion, and perhaps the interest, of the public had
confirmed the division of the Eastern and Western empires; and the two
royal youths, Arcadius and Honorius, who had already obtained, from the
tenderness of their father, the title of Augustus, were destined to fill
the thrones of Constantinople and of Rome. Those princes were not
permitted to share the danger and glory of the civil war; ^123 but as
soon as Theodosius had triumphed over his unworthy rivals, he called his
younger son, Honorius, to enjoy the fruits of the victory, and to
receive the sceptre of the West from the hands of his dying father. The
arrival of Honorius at Milan was welcomed by a splendid exhibition of
the games of the Circus; and the emperor, though he was oppressed by the
weight of his disorder, contributed by his presence to the public joy.
But the remains of his strength were exhausted by the painful effort
which he made to assist at the spectacles of the morning. Honorius
supplied, during the rest of the day, the place of his father; and the
great Theodosius expired in the ensuing night. Notwithstanding the
recent animosities of a civil war, his death was universally lamented.
The Barbarians, whom he had vanquished and the churchmen, by whom he had
been subdued, celebrated, with loud and sincere applause, the qualities
of the deceased emperor, which appeared the most valuable in their eyes.
The Romans were terrified by the impending dangers of a feeble and
divided administration, and every disgraceful moment of the unfortunate
reigns of Arcadius and Honorius revived the memory of their irreparable
loss.</p>
<p>[Footnote 122: This disease, ascribed by Socrates (l. v. c. 26) to
the fatigues of war, is represented by Philostorgius (l. xi. c. 2) as
the effect of sloth and intemperance; for which Photius calls him an
impudent liar, (Godefroy, Dissert. p. 438.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 123: Zosimus supposes, that the boy Honorius accompanied
his father, (l. iv. p. 280.) Yet the quanto flagrabrant pectora voto is
all that flattery would allow to a contemporary poet; who clearly
describes the emperor’s refusal, and the journey of Honorius, after the
victory (Claudian in iii. Cons. 78 - 125.)]</p>
<p>In the faithful picture of the virtues of Theodosius, his
imperfections have not been dissembled; the act of cruelty, and the
habits of indolence, which tarnished the glory of one of the greatest of
the Roman princes. An historian, perpetually adverse to the fame of
Theodosius, has exaggerated his vices, and their pernicious effects; he
boldly asserts, that every rank of subjects imitated the effeminate
manners of their sovereign; and that every species of corruption
polluted the course of public and private life; and that the feeble
restraints of order and decency were insufficient to resist the progress
of that degenerate spirit, which sacrifices, without a blush, the
consideration of duty and interest to the base indulgence of sloth and
appetite. ^124 The complaints of contemporary writers, who deplore the
increase of luxury, and depravation of manners, are commonly expressive
of their peculiar temper and situation. There are few observers, who
possess a clear and comprehensive view of the revolutions of society;
and who are capable of discovering the nice and secret springs of
action, which impel, in the same uniform direction, the blind and
capricious passions of a multitude of individuals. If it can be
affirmed, with any degree of truth, that the luxury of the Romans was
more shameless and dissolute in the reign of Theodosius than in the age
of Constantine, perhaps, or of Augustus, the alteration cannot be
ascribed to any beneficial improvements, which had gradually increased
the stock of national riches. A long period of calamity or decay must
have checked the industry, and diminished the wealth, of the people; and
their profuse luxury must have been the result of that indolent despair,
which enjoys the present hour, and declines the thoughts of futurity.
The uncertain condition of their property discouraged the subjects of
Theodosius from engaging in those useful and laborious undertakings
which require an immediate expense, and promise a slow and distant
advantage. The frequent examples of ruin and desolation tempted them not
to spare the remains of a patrimony, which might, every hour, become the
prey of the rapacious Goth. And the mad prodigality which prevails in
the confusion of a shipwreck, or a siege, may serve to explain the
progress of luxury amidst the misfortunes and terrors of a sinking
nation.</p>
<p>[Footnote 124: Zosimus, l. iv. p. 244.]</p>
<p>The effeminate luxury, which infected the manners of courts and
cities, had instilled a secret and destructive poison into the camps of
the legions; and their degeneracy has been marked by the pen of a
military writer, who had accurately studied the genuine and ancient
principles of Roman discipline. It is the just and important observation
of Vegetius, that the infantry was invariably covered with defensive
armor, from the foundation of the city, to the reign of the emperor
Gratian. The relaxation of discipline, and the disuse of exercise,
rendered the soldiers less able, and less willing, to support the
fatigues of the service; they complained of the weight of the armor,
which they seldom wore; and they successively obtained the permission of
laying aside both their cuirasses and their helmets. The heavy weapons
of their ancestors, the short sword, and the formidable pilum, which had
subdued the world, insensibly dropped from their feeble hands. As the
use of the shield is incompatible with that of the bow, they reluctantly
marched into the field; condemned to suffer either the pain of wounds,
or the ignominy of flight, and always disposed to prefer the more
shameful alternative. The cavalry of the Goths, the Huns, and the Alani,
had felt the benefits, and adopted the use, of defensive armor; and, as
they excelled in the management of missile weapons, they easily
overwhelmed the naked and trembling legions, whose heads and breasts
were exposed, without defence, to the arrows of the Barbarians. The loss
of armies, the destruction of cities, and the dishonor of the Roman
name, ineffectually solicited the successors of Gratian to restore the
helmets and the cuirasses of the infantry. The enervated soldiers
abandoned their own and the public defence; and their pusillanimous
indolence may be considered as the immediate cause of the downfall of
the empire. ^125</p>

calamities which he marks, compel us to believe, that the Hero, to whom
he dedicates his book, is the last and most inglorious of the
Valentinians.]</p>
