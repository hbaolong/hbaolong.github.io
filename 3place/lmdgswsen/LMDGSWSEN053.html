<h4 id="chapter-xv-progress-of-the-christian-religion.">Chapter XV:
Progress Of The Christian Religion.</h4>
<p>Part VIII.</p>
<p>The rich provinces that extend from the Euphrates to the Ionian Sea,
were the principal theatre on which the apostle of the Gentiles
displayed his zeal and piety. The seeds of the gospel, which he had
scattered in a fertile soil, were diligently cultivated by his
disciples; and it should seem that, during the two first centuries, the
most considerable body of Christians was contained within those limits.
Among the societies which were instituted in Syria, none were more
ancient or more illustrious than those of Damascus, of Berea or Aleppo,
and of Antioch. The prophetic introduction of the Apocalypse has
described and immortalized the seven churches of Asia; Ephesus, Smyrna,
Pergamus, Thyatira, ^154 Sardes, Laodicea and Philadelphia; and their
colonies were soon diffused over that populous country. In a very early
period, the islands of Cyprus and Crete, the provinces of Thrace and
Macedonia, gave a favorable reception to the new religion; and Christian
republics were soon founded in the cities of Corinth, of Sparta, and of
Athens. ^155 The antiquity of the Greek and Asiatic churches allowed a
sufficient space of time for their increase and multiplication; and even
the swarms of Gnostics and other heretics serve to display the
flourishing condition of the orthodox church, since the appellation of
hereties has always been applied to the less numerous party. To these
domestic testimonies we may add the confession, the complaints, and the
apprehensions of the Gentiles themselves. From the writings of Lucian, a
philosopher who had studied mankind, and who describes their manners in
the most lively colors, we may learn that, under the reign of Commodus,
his native country of Pontus was filled with Epicureans and Christians.
^156 Within fourscore years after the death of Christ, ^157 the humane
Pliny laments the magnitude of the evil which he vainly attempted to
eradicate. In his very curious epistle to the emperor Trajan, he
affirms, that the temples were almost deserted, that the sacred victims
scarcely found any purchasers, and that the superstition had not only
infected the cities, but had even spread itself into the villages and
the open country of Pontus and Bithynia. ^158</p>
<p>[Footnote 154: The Alogians (Epiphanius de Haeres. 51) disputed the
genuineness of the Apocalypse, because the church of Thyatira was not
yet founded. Epiphanius, who allows the fact, extricates himself from
the difficulty by ingeniously supposing that St. John wrote in the
spirit of prophecy. See Abauzit, Discours sur l’Apocalypse.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 155: The epistles of Ignatius and Dionysius (ap. Euseb. iv.
23) point out many churches in Asia and Greece. That of Athens seems to
have been one of the least flourishing.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 156: Lucian in Alexandro, c. 25. Christianity however, must
have been very unequally diffused over Pontus; since, in the middle of
the third century, there was no more than seventeen believers in the
extensive diocese of Neo-Caesarea. See M. de Tillemont, Memoires
Ecclesiast. tom. iv. p. 675, from Basil and Gregory of Nyssa, who were
themselves natives of Cappadocia. Note: Gibbon forgot the conclusion of
this story, that Gregory left only seventeen heathens in his diocese.
The antithesis is suspicious, and both numbers may have been chosen to
magnify the spiritual fame of the wonder-worker. - M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 157: According to the ancients, Jesus Christ suffered under
the consulship of the two Gemini, in the year 29 of our present aera.
Pliny was sent into Bithynia (according to Pagi) in the year 110.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 158: Plin. Epist. x. 97.]</p>
<p>Without descending into a minute scrutiny of the expressions or of
the motives of those writers who either celebrate or lament the progress
of Christianity in the East, it may in general be observed, that none of
them have left us any grounds from whence a just estimate might be
formed of the real numbers of the faithful in those provinces. One
circumstance, however, has been fortunately preserved, which seems to
cast a more distinct light on this obscure but interesting subject.
Under the reign of Theodosius, after Christianity had enjoyed, during
more than sixty years, the sunshine of Imperial favor, the ancient and
illustrious church of Antioch consisted of one hundred thousand persons,
three thousand of whom were supported out of the public oblations. ^159
The splendor and dignity of the queen of the East, the acknowledged
populousness of Caesarea, Seleucia, and Alexandria, and the destruction
of two hundred and fifty thousand souls in the earthquake which
afflicted Antioch under the elder Justin, ^160 are so many convincing
proofs that the whole number of its inhabitants was not less than half a
million, and that the Christians, however multiplied by zeal and power,
did not exceed a fifth part of that great city. How different a
proportion must we adopt when we compare the persecuted with the
triumphant church, the West with the East, remote villages with populous
towns, and countries recently converted to the faith with the place
where the believers first received the appellation of Christians! It
must not, however, be dissembled, that, in another passage, Chrysostom,
to whom we are indebted for this useful information, computes the
multitude of the faithful as even superior to that of the Jews and
Pagans. ^161 But the solution of this apparent difficulty is easy and
obvious. The eloquent preacher draws a parallel between the civil and
the ecclesiastical constitution of Antioch; between the list of
Christians who had acquired heaven by baptism, and the list of citizens
who had a right to share the public liberality. Slaves, strangers, and
infants were comprised in the former; they were excluded from the
latter.</p>
<p>[Footnote 159: Chrysostom. Opera, tom. vii. p. 658, 810,</p>
<p>[edit. Savil. ii. 422, 329.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 160: John Malala, tom. ii. p. 144. He draws the same
conclusion with regard to the populousness of antioch.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 161: Chrysostom. tom. i. p. 592. I am indebted for these
passages, though not for my inference, to the learned Dr. Lardner.
Credibility of the Gospel of History, vol. xii. p. 370.</p>
<p>Note: The statements of Chrysostom with regard to the population of
Antioch, whatever may be their accuracy, are perfectly consistent. In
one passage he reckons the population at 200,000. In a second the
Christians at 100,000. In a third he states that the Christians formed
more than half the population. Gibbon has neglected to notice the first
passage, and has drawn by estimate of the population of Antioch from
other sources. The 8000 maintained by alms were widows and virgins alone
- M.]</p>
<p>The extensive commerce of Alexandria, and its proximity to Palestine,
gave an easy entrance to the new religion. It was at first embraced by
great numbers of the Theraputae, or Essenians, of the Lake Mareotis, a
Jewish sect which had abated much of its reverence for the Mosaic
ceremonies. The austere life of the Essenians, their fasts and
excommunications, the community of goods, the love of celibacy, their
zeal for martyrdom, and the warmth though not the purity of their faith,
already offered a very lively image of the primitive discipline. ^162 It
was in the school of Alexandria that the Christian theology appears to
have assumed a regular and scientific form; and when Hadrian visited
Egypt, he found a church composed of Jews and of Greeks, sufficiently
important to attract the notice of that inquisitive prince. ^163 But the
progress of Christianity was for a long time confined within the limits
of a single city, which was itself a foreign colony, and till the close
of the second century the predecessors of Demetrius were the only
prelates of the Egyptian church. Three bishops were consecrated by the
hands of Demetrius, and the number was increased to twenty by his
successor Heraclas. ^164 The body of the natives, a people distinguished
by a sullen inflexibility of temper, ^165 entertained the new doctrine
with coldness and reluctance; and even in the time of Origen, it was
rare to meet with an Egyptian who had surmounted his early prejudices in
favor of the sacred animals of his country. ^166 As soon, indeed, as
Christianity ascended the throne, the zeal of those barbarians obeyed
the prevailing impulsion; the cities of Egypt were filled with bishops,
and the deserts of Thebais swarmed with hermits.</p>
<p>[Footnote 162: Basnage, Histoire des Juifs, l. 2, c. 20, 21, 22, 23,
has examined with the most critical accuracy the curious treatise of
Philo, which describes the Therapeutae. By proving that it was composed
as early as the time of Augustus, Basnage has demonstrated, in spite of
Eusebius (l. ii. c. 17) and a crowd of modern Catholics, that the
Therapeutae were neither Christians nor monks. It still remains probable
that they changed their name, preserved their manners, adopted some new
articles of faith, and gradually became the fathers of the Egyptian
Ascetics.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 163: See a letter of Hadrian in the Augustan History,
p. 245.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 164: For the succession of Alexandrian bishops, consult
Renaudot’s History, p. 24, andandandandc. This curious fact is preserved
by the patriarch Eutychius, Annal. tom. i. p. 334, Vers. Pocock,) and
its internal evidence would alone be a sufficient answer to all the
objections which Bishop Pearson has urged in the Vindiciae
Ignatianae.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 165: Ammian. Marcellin. xxii. 16.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 166: Origen contra Celsum, l. i. p. 40.]</p>
<p>A perpetual stream of strangers and provincials flowed into the
capacious bosom of Rome. Whatever was strange or odious, whoever was
guilty or suspected, might hope, in the obscurity of that immense
capital, to elude the vigilance of the law. In such a various conflux of
nations, every teacher, either of truth or falsehood, every founder,
whether of a virtuous or a criminal association, might easily multiply
his disciples or accomplices. The Christians of Rome, at the time of the
accidental persecution of Nero, are represented by Tacitus as already
amounting to a very great multitude, ^167 and the language of that great
historian is almost similar to the style employed by Livy, when he
relates the introduction and the suppression of the rites of Bacchus.
After the Bacchanals had awakened the severity of the senate, it was
likewise apprehended that a very great multitude, as it were another
people, had been initiated into those abhorred mysteries. A more careful
inquiry soon demonstrated, that the offenders did not exceed seven
thousand; a number indeed sufficiently alarming, when considered as the
object of public justice. ^168 It is with the same candid allowance that
we should interpret the vague expressions of Tacitus, and in a former
instance of Pliny, when they exaggerate the crowds of deluded fanatics
who had forsaken the established worship of the gods. The church of Rome
was undoubtedly the first and most populous of the empire; and we are
possessed of an authentic record which attests the state of religion in
that city about the middle of the third century, and after a peace of
thirty-eight years. The clergy, at that time, consisted of a bishop,
forty-six presbyters, seven deacons, as many sub-deacons, forty-two
acolythes, and fifty readers, exorcists, and porters. The number of
widows, of the infirm, and of the poor, who were maintained by the
oblations of the faithful, amounted to fifteen hundred. ^169 From
reason, as well as from the analogy of Antioch, we may venture to
estimate the Christians of Rome at about fifty thousand. The
populousness of that great capital cannot perhaps be exactly
ascertained; but the most modest calculation will not surely reduce it
lower than a million of inhabitants, of whom the Christians might
constitute at the most a twentieth part. ^170</p>
<p>[Footnote 167: Ingens multitudo is the expression of Tacitus, xv.
44.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 168: T. Liv. xxxix. 13, 15, 16, 17. Nothing could exceed
the horror and consternation of the senate on the discovery of the
Bacchanalians, whose depravity is described, and perhaps exaggerated, by
Livy.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 169: Eusebius, l. vi. c. 43. The Latin translator (M. de
Valois) has thought proper to reduce the number of presbyters to
forty-four.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 170: This proportion of the presbyters and of the poor, to
the rest of the people, was originally fixed by Burnet, (Travels into
Italy, p. 168,) and is approved by Moyle, (vol. ii. p. 151.) They were
both unacquainted with the passage of Chrysostom, which converts their
conjecture almost into a fact.]</p>
<p>The western provincials appeared to have derived the knowledge of
Christianity from the same source which had diffused among them the
language, the sentiments, and the manners of Rome.</p>
<p>In this more important circumstance, Africa, as well as Gaul, was
gradually fashioned to the imitation of the capital. Yet notwithstanding
the many favorable occasions which might invite the Roman missionaries
to visit their Latin provinces, it was late before they passed either
the sea or the Alps; ^171 nor can we discover in those great countries
any assured traces either of faith or of persecution that ascend higher
than the reign of the Antonines. ^172 The slow progress of the gospel in
the cold climate of Gaul, was extremely different from the eagerness
with which it seems to have been received on the burning sands of
Africa. The African Christians soon formed one of the principal members
of the primitive church. The practice introduced into that province of
appointing bishops to the most inconsiderable towns, and very frequently
to the most obscure villages, contributed to multiply the splendor and
importance of their religious societies, which during the course of the
third century were animated by the zeal of Tertullian, directed by the
abilities of Cyprian, and adorned by the eloquence of Lactantius.</p>
<p>But if, on the contrary, we turn our eyes towards Gaul, we must
content ourselves with discovering, in the time of Marcus Antoninus, the
feeble and united congregations of Lyons and Vienna; and even as late as
the reign of Decius, we are assured, that in a few cities only, Arles,
Narbonne, Thoulouse, Limoges, Clermont, Tours, and Paris, some scattered
churches were supported by the devotion of a small number of Christians.
^173 Silence is indeed very consistent with devotion; but as it is
seldom compatible with zeal, we may perceive and lament the languid
state of Christianity in those provinces which had exchanged the Celtic
for the Latin tongue, since they did not, during the three first
centuries, give birth to a single ecclesiastical writer. From Gaul,
which claimed a just preeminence of learning and authority over all the
countries on this side of the Alps, the light of the gospel was more
faintly reflected on the remote provinces of Spain and Britain; and if
we may credit the vehement assertions of Tertullian, they had already
received the first rays of the faith, when he addressed his apology to
the magistrates of the emperor Severus. ^174 But the obscure and
imperfect origin of the western churches of Europe has been so
negligently recorded, that if we would relate the time and manner of
their foundation, we must supply the silence of antiquity by those
legends which avarice or superstition long afterwards dictated to the
monks in the lazy gloom of their convents. ^175 Of these holy romances,
that of the apostle St. James can alone, by its singular extravagance,
deserve to be mentioned. From a peaceful fisherman of the Lake of
Gennesareth, he was transformed into a valorous knight, who charged at
the head of the Spanish chivalry in their battles against the Moors. The
gravest historians have celebrated his exploits; the miraculous shrine
of Compostella displayed his power; and the sword of a military order,
assisted by the terrors of the Inquisition, was sufficient to remove
every objection of profane criticism. ^176</p>

Miscellanies, vol. ii. p. 221.]</p>
<p>The progress of Christianity was not confined to the Roman empire;
and according to the primitive fathers, who interpret facts by prophecy,
the new religion, within a century after the death of its divine Author,
had already visited every part of the globe. “There exists not,“ says
Justin Martyr, “a people, whether Greek or Barbarian, or any other race
of men, by whatsoever appellation or manners they may be distinguished,
however ignorant of arts or agriculture, whether they dwell under tents,
or wander about in covered wagons, among whom prayers are not offered up
in the name of a crucified Jesus to the Father and Creator of all
things.“ ^177 But this splendid exaggeration, which even at present it
would be extremely difficult to reconcile with the real state of
mankind, can be considered only as the rash sally of a devout but
careless writer, the measure of whose belief was regulated by that of
his wishes. But neither the belief nor the wishes of the fathers can
alter the truth of history. It will still remain an undoubted fact, that
the barbarians of Scythia and Germany, who afterwards subverted the
Roman monarchy, were involved in the darkness of paganism; and that even
the conversion of Iberia, of Armenia, or of Aethiopia, was not attempted
with any degree of success till the sceptre was in the hands of an
orthodox emperor. ^178 Before that time, the various accidents of war
and commerce might indeed diffuse an imperfect knowledge of the gospel
among the tribes of Caledonia, ^179 and among the borderers of the
Rhine, the Danube, and the Euphrates. ^180 Beyond the last-mentioned
river, Edessa was distinguished by a firm and early adherence to the
faith. ^181 From Edessa the principles of Christianity were easily
introduced into the Greek and Syrian cities which obeyed the successors
of Artaxerxes; but they do not appear to have made any deep impression
on the minds of the Persians, whose religious system, by the labors of a
well disciplined order of priests, had been constructed with much more
art and solidity than the uncertain mythology of Greece and Rome.

<p>[Footnote 180: The Goths, who ravaged Asia in the reign of Gallienus,
carried away great numbers of captives; some of whom were Christians,
and became missionaries. See Tillemont, Memoires Ecclesiast. tom. iv.
p. 44.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 181: The legends of Abgarus, fabulous as it is, affords a
decisive proof, that many years before Eusebius wrote his history, the
greatest part of the inhabitants of Edessa had embraced Christianity.
Their rivals, the citizens of Carrhae, adhered, on the contrary, to the
cause of Paganism, as late as the sixth century.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 182: According to Bardesanes (ap. Euseb. Praepar. Evangel.)
there were some Christians in Persia before the end of the second
century. In the time of Constantine (see his epistle to Sapor, Vit. l.
iv. c. 13) they composed a flourishing church. Consult Beausobre, Hist.
Cristique du Manicheisme, tom. i. p. 180, and the Bibliotheca Orietalis
of Assemani.]</p>
