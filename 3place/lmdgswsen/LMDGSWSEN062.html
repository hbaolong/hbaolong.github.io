XVI: Conduct Towards The Christians, From Nero To Constantine.</h4>
<p>Part VIII.</p>
<p>The vague descriptions of exile and imprisonment, of pain and
torture, are so easily exaggerated or softened by the pencil of an
artful orator, ^* that we are naturally induced to inquire into a fact
of a more distinct and stubborn kind; the number of persons who suffered
death in consequence of the edicts published by Diocletian, his
associates, and his successors. The recent legendaries record whole
armies and cities, which were at once swept away by the undistinguishing
rage of persecution. The more ancient writers content themselves with
pouring out a liberal effusion of loose and tragical invectives, without
condescending to ascertain the precise number of those persons who were
permitted to seal with their blood their belief of the gospel. From the
history of Eusebius, it may, however, be collected, that only nine
bishops were punished with death; and we are assured, by his particular
enumeration of the martyrs of Palestine, that no more than ninety-two
Christians were entitled to that honorable appellation. ^182 ^! As we
are unacquainted with the degree of episcopal zeal and courage which
prevailed at that time, it is not in our power to draw any useful
inferences from the former of these facts: but the latter may serve to
justify a very important and probable conclusion. According to the
distribution of Roman provinces, Palestine may be considered as the
sixteenth part of the Eastern empire: ^183 and since there were some
governors, who from a real or affected clemency had preserved their
hands unstained with the blood of the faithful, ^184 it is reasonable to
believe, that the country which had given birth to Christianity,
produced at least the sixteenth part of the martyrs who suffered death
within the dominions of Galerius and Maximin; the whole might
consequently amount to about fifteen hundred, a number which, if it is
equally divided between the ten years of the persecution, will allow an
annual consumption of one hundred and fifty martyrs. Allotting the same
proportion to the provinces of Italy, Africa, and perhaps Spain, where,
at the end of two or three years, the rigor of the penal laws was either
suspended or abolished, the multitude of Christians in the Roman empire,
on whom a capital punishment was inflicted by a judicia, sentence, will
be reduced to somewhat less than two thousand persons. Since it cannot
be doubted that the Christians were more numerous, and their enemies
more exasperated, in the time of Diocletian, than they had ever been in
any former persecution, this probable and moderate computation may teach
us to estimate the number of primitive saints and martyrs who sacrificed
their lives for the important purpose of introducing Christianity into
the world.</p>
<p>[Footnote *: Perhaps there never was an instance of an author
committing so deliberately the fault which he reprobates so strongly in
others. What is the dexterous management of the more inartificial
historians of Christianity, in exaggerating the numbers of the martyrs,
compared to the unfair address with which Gibbon here quietly dismisses
from the account all the horrible and excruciating tortures which fell
short of death? The reader may refer to the xiith chapter (book viii.)
of Eusebius for the description and for the scenes of these tortures. -
M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 182: Eusebius de Martyr. Palestin. c. 13. He closes his
narration by assuring us that these were the martyrdoms inflicted in
Palestine, during the whole course of the persecution. The 9th chapter
of his viiith book, which relates to the province of Thebais in Egypt,
may seem to contradict our moderate computation; but it will only lead
us to admire the artful management of the historian. Choosing for the
scene of the most exquisite cruelty the most remote and sequestered
country of the Roman empire, he relates that in Thebais from ten to one
hundred persons had frequently suffered martyrdom in the same day. But
when he proceeds to mention his own journey into Egypt, his language
insensibly becomes more cautious and moderate. Instead of a large, but
definite number, he speaks of many Christians, and most artfully selects
two ambiguous words, which may signify either what he had seen, or what
he had heard; either the expectation, or the execution of the
punishment. Having thus provided a secure evasion, he commits the
equivocal passage to his readers and translators; justly conceiving that
their piety would induce them to prefer the most favorable sense.</p>
<p>There was perhaps some malice in the remark of Theodorus Metochita,
that all who, like Eusebius, had been conversant with the Egyptians,
delighted in an obscure and intricate style. (See Valesius ad loc.)</p>
<p>[Footnote !: This calculation is made from the martyrs, of whom
Eusebius speaks by name; but he recognizes a much greater number.</p>
<p>Thus the ninth and tenth chapters of his work are entitled, “Of
Antoninus, Zebinus, Germanus, and other martyrs; of Peter the monk. of
Asclepius the Maroionite, and other martyrs.“</p>
<p>[Are these vague contents of chapters very good authority? - M.]</p>
<p>Speaking of those who suffered under Diocletian, he says, “I will
only relate the death of one of these, from which, the reader may divine
what befell the rest.“ Hist. Eccl. viii. 6.</p>
<p>[This relates only to the martyrs in the royal household. - M.]</p>
<p>Dodwell had made, before Gibbon, this calculation and these
objections; but Ruinart (Act. Mart. Pref p. 27, et seq.) has answered
him in a peremptory manner: Nobis constat Eusebium in historia infinitos
passim martyres admisisse. quamvis revera paucorum nomina recensuerit.
Nec alium Eusebii interpretem quam ipsummet Eusebium proferimus, qui (l.
iii. c. 33) ait sub Trajano plurimosa ex fidelibus martyrii certamen
subiisse (l. v. init.) sub Antonino et Vero innumerabiles prope martyres
per universum orbem enituisse affirmat. (L. vi. c. 1.) Severum
persecutionem concitasse refert, in qua per omnes ubique locorum
Ecclesias, ab athletis pro pietate certantibus, illustria confecta
fuerunt martyria. Sic de Decii, sic de Valeriani, persecutionibus
loquitur, quae an Dodwelli faveant conjectionibus judicet aequus lector.
Even in the persecutions which Gibbon has represented as much more mild
than that of Diocletian, the number of martyrs appears much greater than
that to which he limits the martyrs of the latter: and this number is
attested by incontestable monuments. I will quote but one example. We
find among the letters of St. Cyprian one from Lucianus to Celerinus,
written from the depth of a prison, in which Lucianus names seventeen of
his brethren dead, some in the quarries, some in the midst of tortures
some of starvation in prison. Jussi sumus (he proceeds) secundum prae
ceptum imperatoris, fame et siti necari, et reclusi sumus in duabus
cellis, ta ut nos afficerent fame et siti et ignis vapore. - G.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 183: When Palestine was divided into three, the praefecture
of the East contained forty-eight provinces. As the ancient distinctions
of nations were long since abolished, the Romans distributed the
provinces according to a general proportion of their extent and
opulence.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 184: Ut gloriari possint nullam se innocentium poremisse,
nam et ipse audivi aloquos gloriantes, quia administratio sua, in hac
paris merit incruenta. Lactant. Institur. Divin v. 11.]</p>
<p>We shall conclude this chapter by a melancholy truth, which obtrudes
itself on the reluctant mind; that even admitting, without hesitation or
inquiry, all that history has recorded, or devotion has feigned, on the
subject of martyrdoms, it must still be acknowledged, that the
Christians, in the course of their intestine dissensions, have inflicted
far greater severities on each other, than they had experienced from the
zeal of infidels. During the ages of ignorance which followed the
subversion of the Roman empire in the West, the bishops of the Imperial
city extended their dominion over the laity as well as clergy of the
Latin church. The fabric of superstition which they had erected, and
which might long have defied the feeble efforts of reason, was at length
assaulted by a crowd of daring fanatics, who from the twelfth to the
sixteenth century assumed the popular character of reformers. The church
of Rome defended by violence the empire which she had acquired by fraud;
a system of peace and benevolence was soon disgraced by proscriptions,
war, massacres, and the institution of the holy office. And as the
reformers were animated by the love of civil as well as of religious
freedom, the Catholic princes connected their own interest with that of
the clergy, and enforced by fire and the sword the terrors of spiritual
censures. In the Netherlands alone, more than one hundred thousand of
the subjects of Charles V. are said to have suffered by the hand of the
executioner; and this extraordinary number is attested by Grotius, ^185
a man of genius and learning, who preserved his moderation amidst the
fury of contending sects, and who composed the annals of his own age and
country, at a time when the invention of printing had facilitated the
means of intelligence, and increased the danger of detection.</p>
<p>If we are obliged to submit our belief to the authority of Grotius,
it must be allowed, that the number of Protestants, who were executed in
a single province and a single reign, far exceeded that of the primitive
martyrs in the space of three centuries, and of the Roman empire. But if
the improbability of the fact itself should prevail over the weight of
evidence; if Grotius should be convicted of exaggerating the merit and
sufferings of the Reformers; ^186 we shall be naturally led to inquire
what confidence can be placed in the doubtful and imperfect monuments of
ancient credulity; what degree of credit can be assigned to a courtly
bishop, and a passionate declaimer, ^* who, under the protection of
Constantine, enjoyed the exclusive privilege of recording the
persecutions inflicted on the Christians by the vanquished rivals or
disregarded predecessors of their gracious sovereign.</p>
<p>[Footnote 185: Grot. Annal. de Rebus Belgicis, l. i. p. 12, edit.
fol.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 186: Fra Paola (Istoria del Concilio Tridentino, l. iii.)
reduces the number of the Belgic martyrs to 50,000. In learning and
moderation Fra Paola was not inferior to Grotius. The priority of time
gives some advantage to the evidence of the former, which he loses, on
the other hand, by the distance of Venice from the Netherlands.]</p>
<p>[Footnote *: Eusebius and the author of the Treatise de Mortibus
Persecutorum. It is deeply to be regretted that the history of this
period rest so much on the loose and, it must be admitted, by no means
scrupulous authority of Eusebius. Ecclesiastical history is a solemn and
melancholy lesson that the best, even the most sacred, cause will
eventually the least departure from truth! - M.]</p>
