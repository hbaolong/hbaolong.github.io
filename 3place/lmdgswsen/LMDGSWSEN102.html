<p>The death of Julian had left the public affairs of the empire in a
very doubtful and dangerous situation. The Roman army was saved by an
inglorious, perhaps a necessary treaty; ^1 and the first moments of
peace were consecrated by the pious Jovian to restore the domestic
tranquility of the church and state. The indiscretion of his
predecessor, instead of reconciling, had artfully fomented the religious
war: and the balance which he affected to preserve between the hostile
factions, served only to perpetuate the contest, by the vicissitudes of
hope and fear, by the rival claims of ancient possession and actual
favor. The Christians had forgotten the spirit of the gospel; and the
Pagans had imbibed the spirit of the church. In private families, the
sentiments of nature were extinguished by the blind fury of zeal and
revenge: the majesty of the laws was violated or abused; the cities of
the East were stained with blood; and the most implacable enemies of the
Romans were in the bosom of their country. Jovian was educated in the
profession of Christianity; and as he marched from Nisibis to Antioch,
the banner of the Cross, the Labarum of Constantine, which was again
displayed at the head of the legions, announced to the people the faith
of their new emperor. As soon as he ascended the throne, he transmitted
a circular epistle to all the governors of provinces; in which he
confessed the divine truth, and secured the legal establishment, of the
Christian religion. The insidious edicts of Julian were abolished; the
ecclesiastical immunities were restored and enlarged; and Jovian
condescended to lament, that the distress of the times obliged him to
diminish the measure of charitable distributions. ^2 The Christians were
unanimous in the loud and sincere applause which they bestowed on the
pious successor of Julian. But they were still ignorant what creed, or
what synod, he would choose for the standard of orthodoxy; and the peace
of the church immediately revived those eager disputes which had been
suspended during the season of persecution. The episcopal leaders of the
contending sects, convinced, from experience, how much their fate would
depend on the earliest impressions that were made on the mind of an
untutored soldier, hastened to the court of Edessa, or Antioch. The
highways of the East were crowded with Homoousian, and Arian, and Semi-
Arian, and Eunomian bishops, who struggled to outstrip each other in the
holy race: the apartments of the palace resounded with their clamors;
and the ears of the prince were assaulted, and perhaps astonished, by
the singular mixture of metaphysical argument and passionate invective.
^3 The moderation of Jovian, who recommended concord and charity, and
referred the disputants to the sentence of a future council, was
interpreted as a symptom of indifference: but his attachment to the
Nicene creed was at length discovered and declared, by the reverence
which he expressed for the celestial ^4 virtues of the great Athanasius.
The intrepid veteran of the faith, at the age of seventy, had issued
from his retreat on the first intelligence of the tyrant’s death. The
acclamations of the people seated him once more on the archiepiscopal
throne; and he wisely accepted, or anticipated, the invitation of
Jovian. The venerable figure of Athanasius, his calm courage, and
insinuating eloquence, sustained the reputation which he had already
acquired in the courts of four successive princes. ^5 As soon as he had
gained the confidence, and secured the faith, of the Christian emperor,
he returned in triumph to his diocese, and continued, with mature
counsels and undiminished vigor, to direct, ten years longer, ^6 the
ecclesiastical government of Alexandria, Egypt, and the Catholic church.
Before his departure from Antioch, he assured Jovian that his orthodox
devotion would be rewarded with a long and peaceful reign. Athanasius,
had reason to hope, that he should be allowed either the merit of a
successful prediction, or the excuse of a grateful though ineffectual
prayer. ^7</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: The medals of Jovian adorn him with victories, laurel
crowns, and prostrate captives. Ducange, Famil. Byzantin. p. 52.
Flattery is a foolish suicide; she destroys herself with her own
hands.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: Jovian restored to the church a forcible and
comprehensive expression, (Philostorgius, l. viii. c. 5, with Godefroy’s
Dissertations, p. 329. Sozomen, l. vi. c. 3.) The new law which
condemned the rape or marriage of nuns (Cod. Theod. l. ix. tit. xxv.
leg. 2) is exaggerated by Sozomen; who supposes, that an amorous glance,
the adultery of the heart, was punished with death by the evangelic
legislator.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: Compare Socrates, l. iii. c. 25, and Philostorgius, l.
viii. c. 6, with Godefroy’s Dissertations, p. 330.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: The word celestial faintly expresses the impious and
extravagant flattery of the emperor to the archbishop. (See the original
epistle in Athanasius, tom. ii. p. 33.) Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. xxi.
p. 392) celebrates the friendship of Jovian and Athanasius. The
primate’s journey was advised by the Egyptian monks, (Tillemont, Mem.
Eccles. tom. viii. p. 221.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: Athanasius, at the court of Antioch, is agreeably
represented by La Bleterie, (Hist. de Jovien, tom. i. p. 121-148;) he
translates the singular and original conferences of the emperor, the
primate of Egypt, and the Arian deputies. The Abbe is not satisfied with
the coarse pleasantry of Jovian; but his partiality for Athanasius
assumes, in his eyes, the character of justice.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: The true area of his death is perplexed with some
difficulties, (Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. viii. p. 719-723.) But the
date (A. D. 373, May 2) which seems the most consistent with history and
reason, is ratified by his authentic life, (Maffei Osservazioni
Letterarie, tom. iii. p. 81.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: See the observations of Valesius and Jortin (Remarks on
Ecclesiastical History, vol. iv. p. 38) on the original letter of
Athanasius; which is preserved by Theodoret, (l. iv. c. 3.) In some Mss.
this indiscreet promise is omitted; perhaps by the Catholics, jealous of
the prophetic fame of their leader.]</p>
<p>The slightest force, when it is applied to assist and guide the
natural descent of its object, operates with irresistible weight; and
Jovian had the good fortune to embrace the religious opinions which were
supported by the spirit of the times, and the zeal and numbers of the
most powerful sect. ^8 Under his reign, Christianity obtained an easy
and lasting victory; and as soon as the smile of royal patronage was
withdrawn, the genius of Paganism, which had been fondly raised and
cherished by the arts of Julian, sunk irrecoverably in the. In many
cities, the temples were shut or deserted: the philosophers who had
abused their transient favor, thought it prudent to shave their beards,
and disguise their profession; and the Christians rejoiced, that they
were now in a condition to forgive, or to revenge, the injuries which
they had suffered under the preceding reign. ^9 The consternation of the
Pagan world was dispelled by a wise and gracious edict of toleration; in
which Jovian explicitly declared, that although he should severely
punish the sacrilegious rites of magic, his subjects might exercise,
with freedom and safety, the ceremonies of the ancient worship. The
memory of this law has been preserved by the orator Themistius, who was
deputed by the senate of Constantinople to express their royal devotion
for the new emperor. Themistius expatiates on the clemency of the Divine
Nature, the facility of human error, the rights of conscience, and the
independence of the mind; and, with some eloquence, inculcates the
principles of philosophical toleration; whose aid Superstition herself,
in the hour of her distress, is not ashamed to implore. He justly
observes, that in the recent changes, both religions had been
alternately disgraced by the seeming acquisition of worthless
proselytes, of those votaries of the reigning purple, who could pass,
without a reason, and without a blush, from the church to the temple,
and from the altars of Jupiter to the sacred table of the Christians.
^10</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: Athanasius (apud Theodoret, l. iv. c. 3) magnifies the
number of the orthodox, who composed the whole world. This assertion was
verified in the space of thirty and forty years.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: Socrates, l. iii. c. 24. Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. iv.
p. 131) and Libanius (Orat. Parentalis, c. 148, p. 369) expresses the
living sentiments of their respective factions.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: Themistius, Orat. v. p. 63-71, edit. Harduin, Paris,
1684. The Abbe de la Bleterie judiciously remarks, (Hist. de Jovien,
tom. i. p. 199,) that Sozomen has forgot the general toleration; and
Themistius the establishment of the Catholic religion. Each of them
turned away from the object which he disliked, and wished to suppress
the part of the edict the least honorable, in his opinion, to the
emperor.]</p>
<p>In the space of seven months, the Roman troops, who were now returned
to Antioch, had performed a march of fifteen hundred miles; in which
they had endured all the hardships of war, of famine, and of climate.
Notwithstanding their services, their fatigues, and the approach of
winter, the timid and impatient Jovian allowed only, to the men and
horses, a respite of six weeks. The emperor could not sustain the
indiscreet and malicious raillery of the people of Antioch. ^11 He was
impatient to possess the palace of Constantinople; and to prevent the
ambition of some competitor, who might occupy the vacant allegiance of
Europe. But he soon received the grateful intelligence, that his
authority was acknowledged from the Thracian Bosphorus to the Atlantic
Ocean. By the first letters which he despatched from the camp of
Mesopotamia, he had delegated the military command of Gaul and Illyricum
to Malarich, a brave and faithful officer of the nation of the Franks;
and to his father-in-law, Count Lucillian, who had formerly
distinguished his courage and conduct in the defence of Nisibis.
Malarich had declined an office to which he thought himself unequal; and
Lucillian was massacred at Rheims, in an accidental mutiny of the
Batavian cohorts. ^12 But the moderation of Jovinus, master- general of
the cavalry, who forgave the intention of his disgrace, soon appeased
the tumult, and confirmed the uncertain minds of the soldiers. The oath
of fidelity was administered and taken, with loyal acclamations; and the
deputies of the Western armies ^13 saluted their new sovereign as he
descended from Mount Taurus to the city of Tyana in Cappadocia. From
Tyana he continued his hasty march to Ancyra, capital of the province of
Galatia; where Jovian assumed, with his infant son, the name and ensigns
of the consulship. ^14 Dadastana, ^15 an obscure town, almost at an
equal distance between Ancyra and Nice, was marked for the fatal term of
his journey and life. After indulging himself with a plentiful, perhaps
an intemperate, supper, he retired to rest; and the next morning the
emperor Jovian was found dead in his bed. The cause of this sudden death
was variously understood. By some it was ascribed to the consequences of
an indigestion, occasioned either by the quantity of the wine, or the
quality of the mushrooms, which he had swallowed in the evening.
According to others, he was suffocated in his sleep by the vapor of
charcoal, which extracted from the walls of the apartment the
unwholesome moisture of the fresh plaster. ^16 But the want of a regular
inquiry into the death of a prince, whose reign and person were soon
forgotten, appears to have been the only circumstance which countenanced
the malicious whispers of poison and domestic guilt. ^17 The body of
Jovian was sent to Constantinople, to be interred with his predecessors,
and the sad procession was met on the road by his wife Charito, the
daughter of Count Lucillian; who still wept the recent death of her
father, and was hastening to dry her tears in the embraces of an
Imperial husband. Her disappointment and grief were imbittered by the
anxiety of maternal tenderness. Six weeks before the death of Jovian,
his infant son had been placed in the curule chair, adorned with the
title of Nobilissimus, and the vain ensigns of the consulship.
Unconscious of his fortune, the royal youth, who, from his grandfather,
assumed the name of Varronian, was reminded only by the jealousy of the
government, that he was the son of an emperor. Sixteen years afterwards
he was still alive, but he had already been deprived of an eye; and his
afflicted mother expected every hour, that the innocent victim would be
torn from her arms, to appease, with his blood, the suspicions of the
reigning prince. ^18</p>
<p>[Footnote 11: Johan. Antiochen. in Excerpt. Valesian. p. 845. The
libels of Antioch may be admitted on very slight evidence.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 12: Compare Ammianus, (xxv. 10,) who omits the name of the
Batarians, with Zosimus, (l. iii. p. 197,) who removes the scene of
action from Rheims to Sirmium.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 14: Cugus vagitus, pertinaciter reluctantis, ne in curuli

his successors respectfully solicited a dispensation of age for the sons
or nephews whom they raised to the consulship. But the curule chair of
the first Brutus had never been dishonored by an infant.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 15: The Itinerary of Antoninus fixes Dadastana 125 Roman
miles from Nice; 117 from Ancyra, (Wesseling, Itinerar. p. 142.) The
pilgrim of Bourdeaux, by omitting some stages, reduces the whole space
from 242 to 181 miles. Wesseling, p. 574.</p>
<p>Note: Dadastana is supposed to be Castabat. - M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 16: See Ammianus, (xxv. 10,) Eutropius, (x. 18.) who might
likewise be present, Jerom, (tom. i. p. 26, ad Heliodorum.) Orosius,
(vii. 31,) Sozomen, (l. vi. c. 6,) Zosimus, (l. iii. p. 197, 198,) and
Zonaras, (tom. ii. l. xiii. p. 28, 29.) We cannot expect a perfect
agreement, and we shall not discuss minute differences.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 17: Ammianus, unmindful of his usual candor and good sense,
compares the death of the harmless Jovian to that of the second
Africanus, who had excited the fears and resentment of the popular
faction.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 18: Chrysostom, tom. i. p. 336, 344, edit. Montfaucon. The
Christian orator attempts to comfort a widow by the examples of
illustrious misfortunes; and observes, that of nine emperors (including
the Caesar Gallus) who had reigned in his time, only two (Constantine
and Constantius) died a natural death. Such vague consolations have
never wiped away a single tear.]</p>
<p>After the death of Jovian, the throne of the Roman world remained ten
days, ^19 without a master. The ministers and generals still continued
to meet in council; to exercise their respective functions; to maintain
the public order; and peaceably to conduct the army to the city of Nice
in Bithynia, which was chosen for the place of the election. ^20 In a
solemn assembly of the civil and military powers of the empire, the
diadem was again unanimously offered to the praefect Sallust. He enjoyed
the glory of a second refusal: and when the virtues of the father were
alleged in favor of his son, the praefect, with the firmness of a
disinterested patriot, declared to the electors, that the feeble age of
the one, and the unexperienced youth of the other, were equally
incapable of the laborious duties of government. Several candidates were
proposed; and, after weighing the objections of character or situation,
they were successively rejected; but, as soon as the name of Valentinian
was pronounced, the merit of that officer united the suffrages of the
whole assembly, and obtained the sincere approbation of Sallust himself.
Valentinian ^21 was the son of Count Gratian, a native of Cibalis, in
Pannonia, who from an obscure condition had raised himself, by matchless
strength and dexterity, to the military commands of Africa and Britain;
from which he retired with an ample fortune and suspicious integrity.
The rank and services of Gratian contributed, however, to smooth the
first steps of the promotion of his son; and afforded him an early
opportunity of displaying those solid and useful qualifications, which
raised his character above the ordinary level of his fellow-soldiers.
The person of Valentinian was tall, graceful, and majestic. His manly
countenance, deeply marked with the impression of sense and spirit,
inspired his friends with awe, and his enemies with fear; and to second
the efforts of his undaunted courage, the son of Gratian had inherited
the advantages of a strong and healthy constitution. By the habits of
chastity and temperance, which restrain the appetites and invigorate the
faculties, Valentinian preserved his own and the public esteem. The
avocations of a military life had diverted his youth from the elegant
pursuits of literature; ^* he was ignorant of the Greek language, and
the arts of rhetoric; but as the mind of the orator was never
disconcerted by timid perplexity, he was able, as often as the occasion
prompted him, to deliver his decided sentiments with bold and ready
elocution. The laws of martial discipline were the only laws that he had
studied; and he was soon distinguished by the laborious diligence, and
inflexible severity, with which he discharged and enforced the duties of
the camp. In the time of Julian he provoked the danger of disgrace, by
the contempt which he publicly expressed for the reigning religion; ^22
and it should seem, from his subsequent conduct, that the indiscreet and
unseasonable freedom of Valentinian was the effect of military spirit,
rather than of Christian zeal. He was pardoned, however, and still
employed by a prince who esteemed his merit; ^23 and in the various
events of the Persian war, he improved the reputation which he had
already acquired on the banks of the Rhine. The celerity and success
with which he executed an important commission, recommended him to the
favor of Jovian; and to the honorable command of the second school, or
company, of Targetiers, of the domestic guards. In the march from
Antioch, he had reached his quarters at Ancyra, when he was unexpectedly
summoned, without guilt and without intrigue, to assume, in the
forty-third year of his age, the absolute government of the Roman
empire.</p>
<p>[Footnote 19: Ten days appear scarcely sufficient for the march and
election. But it may be observed, 1. That the generals might command the
expeditious use of the public posts for themselves, their attendants,
and messengers. 2. That the troops, for the ease of the cities, marched
in many divisions; and that the head of the column might arrive at Nice,
when the rear halted at Ancyra.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 20: Ammianus, xxvi. 1. Zosimus, l. iii. p. 198.
Philostorgius, l. viii. c. 8, and Godefroy, Dissertat. p. 334.
Philostorgius, who appears to have obtained some curious and authentic
intelligence, ascribes the choice of Valentinian to the praefect
Sallust, the master-general Arintheus, Dagalaiphus count of the
domestics, and the patrician Datianus, whose pressing recommendations
from Ancyra had a weighty influence in the election.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 21: Ammianus (xxx. 7, 9) and the younger Victor have
furnished the portrait of Valentinian, which naturally precedes and
illustrates the history of his reign.</p>
<p>Note: Symmachus, in a fragment of an oration published by M. Mai,
describes Valentinian as born among the snows of Illyria, and habituated
to military labor amid the heat and dust of Libya: genitus in
frigoribus, educatus is solibus Sym. Orat. Frag. edit. Niebuhr, p. 5. -

skilled in painting and modelling. Scribens decore, venusteque pingens

<p>[Footnote 22: At Antioch, where he was obliged to attend the emperor
to the table, he struck a priest, who had presumed to purify him with
lustral water, (Sozomen, l. vi. c. 6. Theodoret, l. iii. c. 15.) Such
public defiance might become Valentinian; but it could leave no room for
the unworthy delation of the philosopher Maximus, which supposes some
more private offence, (Zosimus, l. iv. p. 200, 201.)]</p>

<p>The invitation of the ministers and generals at Nice was of little
moment, unless it were confirmed by the voice of the army.</p>
<p>The aged Sallust, who had long observed the irregular fluctuations of
popular assemblies, proposed, under pain of death, that none of those
persons, whose rank in the service might excite a party in their favor,
should appear in public on the day of the inauguration. Yet such was the
prevalence of ancient superstition, that a whole day was voluntarily
added to this dangerous interval, because it happened to be the
intercalation of the Bissextile. ^24 At length, when the hour was
supposed to be propitious, Valentinian showed himself from a lofty
tribunal; the judicious choice was applauded; and the new prince was
solemnly invested with the diadem and the purple, amidst the acclamation
of the troops, who were disposed in martial order round the tribunal.
But when he stretched forth his hand to address the armed multitude, a
busy whisper was accidentally started in the ranks, and insensibly
swelled into a loud and imperious clamor, that he should name, without
delay, a colleague in the empire. The intrepid calmness of Valentinian
obtained silence, and commanded respect; and he thus addressed the
assembly: “A few minutes since it was in your power, fellow-soldiers, to
have left me in the obscurity of a private station. Judging, from the
testimony of my past life, that I deserved to reign, you have placed me
on the throne. It is now my duty to consult the safety and interest of
the republic. The weight of the universe is undoubtedly too great for
the hands of a feeble mortal. I am conscious of the limits of my
abilities, and the uncertainty of my life; and far from declining, I am
anxious to solicit, the assistance of a worthy colleague. But, where
discord may be fatal, the choice of a faithful friend requires mature
and serious deliberation. That deliberation shall be my care. Let your
conduct be dutiful and consistent. Retire to your quarters; refresh your
minds and bodies; and expect the accustomed donative on the accession of
a new emperor.“ ^25 The astonished troops, with a mixture of pride, of
satisfaction, and of terror, confessed the voice of their master.</p>
<p>Their angry clamors subsided into silent reverence; and Valentinian,
encompassed with the eagles of the legions, and the various banners of
the cavalry and infantry, was conducted, in warlike pomp, to the palace
of Nice. As he was sensible, however, of the importance of preventing
some rash declaration of the soldiers, he consulted the assembly of the
chiefs; and their real sentiments were concisely expressed by the
generous freedom of Dagalaiphus. “Most excellent prince,“ said that
officer, “if you consider only your family, you have a brother; if you
love the republic, look round for the most deserving of the Romans.“ ^26
The emperor, who suppressed his displeasure, without altering his
intention, slowly proceeded from Nice to Nicomedia and Constantinople.
In one of the suburbs of that capital, ^27 thirty days after his own
elevation, he bestowed the title of Augustus on his brother Valens; ^*
and as the boldest patriots were convinced, that their opposition,
without being serviceable to their country, would be fatal to
themselves, the declaration of his absolute will was received with
silent submission. Valens was now in the thirty-sixth year of his age;
but his abilities had never been exercised in any employment, military
or civil; and his character had not inspired the world with any sanguine
expectations. He possessed, however, one quality, which recommended him
to Valentinian, and preserved the domestic peace of the empire; devout
and grateful attachment to his benefactor, whose superiority of genius,
as well as of authority, Valens humbly and cheerfully acknowledged in
every action of his life. ^28</p>

(xxvi. l, and Valesius, ad locum,) rashly supposes that he understands
an astronomical question, of which his readers are ignorant. It is
treated with more judgment and propriety by Censorinus (de Die Natali,
c. 20) and Macrobius, (Saturnal. i. c. 12-16.) The appellation of
Bissextile, which marks the inauspicious year, (Augustin. ad Januarium,
Epist. 119,) is derived from the repetition of the sixth day of the
calends of March.]</p>
