XVI: Conduct Towards The Christians, From Nero To Constantine.</h4>
<p>Part III.</p>
<p>The answer of Trajan, to which the Christians of the succeeding age
have frequently appealed, discovers as much regard for justice and
humanity as could be reconciled with his mistaken notions of religious
policy. ^59 Instead of displaying the implacable zeal of an inquisitor,
anxious to discover the most minute particles of heresy, and exulting in
the number of his victims, the emperor expresses much more solicitude to
protect the security of the innocent, than to prevent the escape of the
guilty. He acknowledged the difficulty of fixing any general plan; but
he lays down two salutary rules, which often afforded relief and support
to the distressed Christians. Though he directs the magistrates to
punish such persons as are legally convicted, he prohibits them, with a
very humane inconsistency, from making any inquiries concerning the
supposed criminals. Nor was the magistrate allowed to proceed on every
kind of information. Anonymous charges the emperor rejects, as too
repugnant to the equity of his government; and he strictly requires, for
the conviction of those to whom the guilt of Christianity is imputed,
the positive evidence of a fair and open accuser. It is likewise
probable, that the persons who assumed so invidiuous an office, were
obliged to declare the grounds of their suspicions, to specify (both in
respect to time and place) the secret assemblies, which their Christian
adversary had frequented, and to disclose a great number of
circumstances, which were concealed with the most vigilant jealousy from
the eye of the profane. If they succeeded in their prosecution, they
were exposed to the resentment of a considerable and active party, to
the censure of the more liberal portion of mankind, and to the ignominy
which, in every age and country, has attended the character of an
informer. If, on the contrary, they failed in their proofs, they
incurred the severe and perhaps capital penalty, which, according to a
law published by the emperor Hadrian, was inflicted on those who falsely
attributed to their fellow-citizens the crime of Christianity. The
violence of personal or superstitious animosity might sometimes prevail
over the most natural apprehensions of disgrace and danger but it cannot
surely be imagined, that accusations of so unpromising an appearance
were either lightly or frequently undertaken by the Pagan subjects of
the Roman empire. ^60 ^*</p>
<p>[Footnote 59: Plin. Epist. x. 98. Tertullian (Apolog. c. 5) considers
this rescript as a relaxation of the ancient penal laws, “quas Trajanus
exparte frustratus est: “ and yet Tertullian, in another part of his
Apology, exposes the inconsistency of prohibiting inquiries, and
enjoining punishments.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 60: Eusebius (Hist. Ecclesiast. l. iv. c. 9) has preserved
the edict of Hadrian. He has likewise (c. 13) given us one still more
favorable, under the name of Antoninus; the authenticity of which is not
so universally allowed. The second Apology of Justin contains some
curious particulars relative to the accusations of Christians.</p>
<p>Note: Professor Hegelmayer has proved the authenticity of the edict
of Antoninus, in his Comm. Hist. Theol. in Edict. Imp. Antonini. Tubing.
1777, in 4to. - G.</p>
<p>Neander doubts its authenticity, (vol. i. p. 152.) In my opinion, the
internal evidence is decisive against it. - M]</p>
<p>[Footnote *: The enactment of this law affords strong presumption,
that accusations of the “crime of Christianity,“ were by no means so
uncommon, nor received with so much mistrust and caution by the ruling
authorities, as Gibbon would insinuate. - M.]</p>
<p>The expedient which was employed to elude the prudence of the laws,
affords a sufficient proof how effectually they disappointed the
mischievous designs of private malice or superstitious zeal. In a large
and tumultuous assembly, the restraints of fear and shame, so forcible
on the minds of individuals, are deprived of the greatest part of their
influence. The pious Christian, as he was desirous to obtain, or to
escape, the glory of martyrdom, expected, either with impatience or with
terror, the stated returns of the public games and festivals. On those
occasions the inhabitants of the great cities of the empire were
collected in the circus or the theatre, where every circumstance of the
place, as well as of the ceremony, contributed to kindle their devotion,
and to extinguish their humanity. Whilst the numerous spectators,
crowned with garlands, perfumed with incense, purified with the blood of
victims, and surrounded with the altars and statues of their tutelar
deities, resigned themselves to the enjoyment of pleasures, which they
considered as an essential part of their religious worship, they
recollected, that the Christians alone abhorred the gods of mankind, and
by their absence and melancholy on these solemn festivals, seemed to
insult or to lament the public felicity. If the empire had been
afflicted by any recent calamity, by a plague, a famine, or an
unsuccessful war; if the Tyber had, or if the Nile had not, risen beyond
its banks; if the earth had shaken, or if the temperate order of the
seasons had been interrupted, the superstitious Pagans were convinced
that the crimes and the impiety of the Christians, who were spared by
the excessive lenity of the government, had at length provoked the
divine justice. It was not among a licentious and exasperated populace,
that the forms of legal proceedings could be observed; it was not in an
amphitheatre, stained with the blood of wild beasts and gladiators, that
the voice of compassion could be heard. The impatient clamors of the
multitude denounced the Christians as the enemies of gods and men,
doomed them to the severest tortures, and venturing to accuse by name
some of the most distinguished of the new sectaries, required with
irresistible vehemence that they should be instantly apprehended and
cast to the lions. ^61 The provincial governors and magistrates who
presided in the public spectacles were usually inclined to gratify the
inclinations, and to appease the rage, of the people, by the sacrifice
of a few obnoxious victims. But the wisdom of the emperors protected the
church from the danger of these tumultuous clamors and irregular
accusations, which they justly censured as repugnant both to the
firmness and to the equity of their administration. The edicts of
Hadrian and of Antoninus Pius expressly declared, that the voice of the
multitude should never be admitted as legal evidence to convict or to
punish those unfortunate persons who had embraced the enthusiasm of the
Christians. ^62</p>
<p>[Footnote 61: See Tertullian, (Apolog. c. 40.) The acts of the
martyrdom of Polycarp exhibit a lively picture of these tumults, which
were usually fomented by the malice of the Jews.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 62: These regulations are inserted in the above mentioned
document of Hadrian and Pius. See the apology of Melito, (apud Euseb. l
iv 26)]</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>Punishment was not the inevitable consequence of conviction, and the
Christians, whose guilt was the most clearly proved by the testimony of
witnesses, or even by their voluntary confession, still retained in
their own power the alternative of life or death. It was not so much the
past offence, as the actual resistance, which excited the indignation of
the magistrate. He was persuaded that he offered them an easy pardon,
since, if they consented to cast a few grains of incense upon the altar,
they were dismissed from the tribunal in safety and with applause. It
was esteemed the duty of a humane judge to endeavor to reclaim, rather
than to punish, those deluded enthusiasts. Varying his tone according to
the age, the sex, or the situation of the prisoners, he frequently
condescended to set before their eyes every circumstance which could
render life more pleasing, or death more terrible; and to solicit, nay,
to entreat, them, that they would show some compassion to themselves, to
their families, and to their friends. ^63 If threats and persuasions
proved ineffectual, he had often recourse to violence; the scourge and
the rack were called in to supply the deficiency of argument, and every
art of cruelty was employed to subdue such inflexible, and, as it
appeared to the Pagans, such criminal, obstinacy. The ancient apologists
of Christianity have censured, with equal truth and severity, the
irregular conduct of their persecutors who, contrary to every principle
of judicial proceeding, admitted the use of torture, in order to obtain,
not a confession, but a denial, of the crime which was the object of
their inquiry. ^64 The monks of succeeding ages, who, in their peaceful
solitudes, entertained themselves with diversifying the deaths and
sufferings of the primitive martyrs, have frequently invented torments
of a much more refined and ingenious nature. In particular, it has
pleased them to suppose, that the zeal of the Roman magistrates,
disdaining every consideration of moral virtue or public decency,
endeavored to seduce those whom they were unable to vanquish, and that
by their orders the most brutal violence was offered to those whom they
found it impossible to seduce. It is related, that females, who were
prepared to despise death, were sometimes condemned to a more severe
trial, ^! and called upon to determine whether they set a higher value
on their religion or on their chastity. The youths to whose licentious
embraces they were abandoned, received a solemn exhortation from the
judge, to exert their most strenuous efforts to maintain the honor of
Venus against the impious virgin who refused to burn incense on her
altars. Their violence, however, was commonly disappointed, and the
seasonable interposition of some miraculous power preserved the chaste
spouses of Christ from the dishonor even of an involuntary defeat. We
should not indeed neglect to remark, that the more ancient as well as
authentic memorials of the church are seldom polluted with these
extravagant and indecent fictions. ^65</li>
</ol>
<p>[Footnote 63: See the rescript of Trajan, and the conduct of Pliny.
The most authentic acts of the martyrs abound in these exhortations.
Note: Pliny’s test was the worship of the gods, offerings to the statue
of the emperor, and blaspheming Christ - praeterea maledicerent Christo.
- M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 64: In particular, see Tertullian, (Apolog. c. 2, 3,) and
Lactantius, (Institut. Divin. v. 9.) Their reasonings are almost the
same; but we may discover, that one of these apologists had been a
lawyer, and the other a rhetorician.]</p>
<p>[Footnote !: The more ancient as well as authentic memorials of the
church, relate many examples of the fact, (of these severe trials,)
which there is nothing to contradict. Tertullian, among others, says,
Nam proxime ad lenonem damnando Christianam, potius quam ad leonem,
confessi estis labem pudicitiae apud nos atrociorem omni poena et omni
morte reputari, Apol. cap. ult. Eusebius likewise says, “Other virgins,
dragged to brothels, have lost their life rather than defile their
virtue.“ Euseb. Hist. Ecc. viii. 14. - G. The miraculous interpositions
were the offspring of the coarse imaginations of the monks. - M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 65: See two instances of this kind of torture in the Acta
Sincere Martyrum, published by Ruinart, p. 160, 399. Jerome, in his
Legend of Paul the Hermit, tells a strange story of a young man, who was
chained naked on a bed of flowers, and assaulted by a beautiful and
wanton courtesan. He quelled the rising temptation by biting off his
tongue.]</p>
<p>The total disregard of truth and probability in the representation of
these primitive martyrdoms was occasioned by a very natural mistake. The
ecclesiastical writers of the fourth or fifth centuries ascribed to the
magistrates of Rome the same degree of implacable and unrelenting zeal
which filled their own breasts against the heretics or the idolaters of
their own times.</p>
<p>It is not improbable that some of those persons who were raised to
the dignities of the empire, might have imbibed the prejudices of the
populace, and that the cruel disposition of others might occasionally be
stimulated by motives of avarice or of personal resentment. ^66 But it
is certain, and we may appeal to the grateful confessions of the first
Christians, that the greatest part of those magistrates who exercised in
the provinces the authority of the emperor, or of the senate, and to
whose hands alone the jurisdiction of life and death was intrusted,
behaved like men of polished manners and liberal education, who
respected the rules of justice, and who were conversant with the
precepts of philosophy. They frequently declined the odious task of
persecution, dismissed the charge with contempt, or suggested to the
accused Christian some legal evasion, by which he might elude the
severity of the laws. ^67 Whenever they were invested with a
discretionary power, ^68 they used it much less for the oppression, than
for the relief and benefit of the afflicted church. They were far from
condemning all the Christians who were accused before their tribunal,
and very far from punishing with death all those who were convicted of
an obstinate adherence to the new superstition. Contenting themselves,
for the most part, with the milder chastisements of imprisonment, exile,
or slavery in the mines, ^69 they left the unhappy victims of their
justice some reason to hope, that a prosperous event, the accession, the
marriage, or the triumph of an emperor, might speedily restore them, by
a general pardon, to their former state. The martyrs, devoted to
immediate execution by the Roman magistrates, appear to have been
selected from the most opposite extremes. They were either bishops and
presbyters, the persons the most distinguished among the Christians by
their rank and influence, and whose example might strike terror into the
whole sect; ^70 or else they were the meanest and most abject among
them, particularly those of the servile condition, whose lives were
esteemed of little value, and whose sufferings were viewed by the
ancients with too careless an indifference. ^71 The learned Origen, who,
from his experience as well as reading, was intimately acquainted with
the history of the Christians, declares, in the most express terms, that
the number of martyrs was very inconsiderable. ^72 His authority would
alone be sufficient to annihilate that formidable army of martyrs, whose
relics, drawn for the most part from the catacombs of Rome, have
replenished so many churches, ^73 and whose marvellous achievements have
been the subject of so many volumes of Holy Romance. ^74 But the general
assertion of Origen may be explained and confirmed by the particular
testimony of his friend Dionysius, who, in the immense city of
Alexandria, and under the rigorous persecution of Decius, reckons only
ten men and seven women who suffered for the profession of the Christian
name. ^75</p>
<p>[Footnote 66: The conversion of his wife provoked Claudius
Herminianus, governor of Cappadocia, to treat the Christians with
uncommon severity. Tertullian ad Scapulam, c. 3.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 67: Tertullian, in his epistle to the governor of Africa,
mentions several remarkable instances of lenity and forbearance, which
had happened within his knowledge.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 68: Neque enim in universum aliquid quod quasi certam
formam habeat, constitui potest; an expression of Trajan, which gave a
very great latitude to the governors of provinces.</p>
<p>Note: Gibbon altogether forgets that Trajan fully approved of the
course pursued by Pliny. That course was, to order all who persevered in
their faith to be led to execution: perseverantes duci jussi. - M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 69: In Metalla damnamur, in insulas relegamur. Tertullian,
Apolog. c. 12. The mines of Numidia contained nine bishops, with a
proportionable number of their clergy and people, to whom Cyprian
addressed a pious epistle of praise and comfort. See Cyprian. Epistol.
76, 77.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 70: Though we cannot receive with entire confidence either
the epistles, or the acts, of Ignatius, (they may be found in the 2d
volume of the Apostolic Fathers,) yet we may quote that bishop of
Antioch as one of these exemplary martyrs. He was sent in chains to Rome
as a public spectacle, and when he arrived at Troas, he received the
pleasing intelligence, that the persecution of Antioch was already at an
end.</p>
<p>Note: The acts of Ignatius are generally received as authentic, as
are seven of his letters. Eusebius and St. Jerome mention them: there
are two editions; in one, the letters are longer, and many passages
appear to have been interpolated; the other edition is that which
contains the real letters of St. Ignatius; such at least is the opinion
of the wisest and most enlightened critics. (See Lardner. Cred. of
Gospel Hist.) Less, uber dis Religion, v. i. p. 529. Usser. Diss. de
Ign. Epist. Pearson, Vindic, Ignatianae. It should be remarked, that it
was under the reign of Trajan that the bishop Ignatius was carried from
Antioch to Rome, to be exposed to the lions in the amphitheatre, the
year of J. C. 107, according to some; of 116, according to others. -
G.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 71: Among the martyrs of Lyons, (Euseb. l. v. c. 1,) the
slave Blandina was distinguished by more exquisite tortures. Of the five
martyrs so much celebrated in the acts of Felicitas and Perpetua, two
were of a servile, and two others of a very mean, condition.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 72: Origen. advers. Celsum, l. iii. p. 116. His words
deserve to be transcribed.</p>
<p>Note: The words that follow should be quoted. “God not permitting
that all his class of men should be exterminated: “ which appears to
indicate that Origen thought the number put to death inconsiderable only
when compared to the numbers who had survived. Besides this, he is
speaking of the state of the religion under Caracalla, Elagabalus,
Alexander Severus, and Philip, who had not persecuted the Christians. It
was during the reign of the latter that Origen wrote his books against
Celsus. - G.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 73: If we recollect that all the Plebeians of Rome were not
Christians, and that all the Christians were not saints and martyrs, we
may judge with how much safety religious honors can be ascribed to bones
or urns, indiscriminately taken from the public burial-place. After ten
centuries of a very free and open trade, some suspicions have arisen
among the more learned Catholics. They now require as a proof of
sanctity and martyrdom, the letters B.M., a vial full of red liquor
supposed to be blood, or the figure of a palm-tree. But the two former
signs are of little weight, and with regard to the last, it is observed
by the critics, 1. That the figure, as it is called, of a palm, is
perhaps a cypress, and perhaps only a stop, the flourish of a comma used
in the monumental inscriptions. 2. That the palm was the symbol of
victory among the Pagans. 3. That among the Christians it served as the
emblem, not only of martyrdom, but in general of a joyful resurrection.
See the epistle of P. Mabillon, on the worship of unknown saints, and
Muratori sopra le Antichita Italiane, Dissertat. lviii.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 74: As a specimen of these legends, we may be satisfied
with 10,000 Christian soldiers crucified in one day, either by Trajan or
Hadrian on Mount Ararat. See Baronius ad Martyrologium Romanum; Tille
mont, Mem. Ecclesiast. tom. ii. part ii. p. 438; and Geddes’s
Miscellanies, vol. ii. p. 203. The abbreviation of Mil., which may
signify either soldiers or thousands, is said to have occasioned some
extraordinary mistakes.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 75: Dionysius ap. Euseb l. vi. c. 41 One of the seventeen
was likewise accused of robbery.</p>
<p>Note: Gibbon ought to have said, was falsely accused of robbery, for
so it is in the Greek text. This Christian, named Nemesion, falsely
accused of robbery before the centurion, was acquitted of a crime
altogether foreign to his character, but he was led before the governor
as guilty of being a Christian, and the governor inflicted upon him a
double torture. (Euseb. loc. cit.) It must be added, that Saint
Dionysius only makes particular mention of the principal martyrs,</p>
<p>[this is very doubtful. - M.]</p>
<p>and that he says, in general, that the fury of the Pagans against the
Christians gave to Alexandria the appearance of a city taken by
storm.</p>
<p>[This refers to plunder and ill usage, not to actual slaughter. -
M.]</p>
<p>Finally it should be observed that Origen wrote before the
persecution of the emperor Decius. - G.]</p>
<p>During the same period of persecution, the zealous, the eloquent, the
ambitious Cyprian governed the church, not only of Carthage, but even of
Africa. He possessed every quality which could engage the reverence of
the faithful, or provoke the suspicions and resentment of the Pagan
magistrates. His character as well as his station seemed to mark out
that holy prelate as the most distinguished object of envy and danger.
^76 The experience, however, of the life of Cyprian, is sufficient to
prove that our fancy has exaggerated the perilous situation of a
Christian bishop; and the dangers to which he was exposed were less
imminent than those which temporal ambition is always prepared to
encounter in the pursuit of honors. Four Roman emperors, with their
families, their favorites, and their adherents, perished by the sword in
the space of ten years, during which the bishop of Carthage guided by
his authority and eloquence the councils of the African church. It was
only in the third year of his administration, that he had reason, during
a few months, to apprehend the severe edicts of Decius, the vigilance of
the magistrate and the clamors of the multitude, who loudly demanded,
that Cyprian, the leader of the Christians, should be thrown to the
lions. Prudence suggested the necessity of a temporary retreat, and the
voice of prudence was obeyed. He withdrew himself into an obscure
solitude, from whence he could maintain a constant correspondence with
the clergy and people of Carthage; and, concealing himself till the
tempest was past, he preserved his life, without relinquishing either
his power or his reputation. His extreme caution did not, however,
escape the censure of the more rigid Christians, who lamented, or the
reproaches of his personal enemies, who insulted, a conduct which they
considered as a pusillanimous and criminal desertion of the most sacred
duty. ^77 The propriety of reserving himself for the future exigencies
of the church, the example of several holy bishops, ^78 and the divine
admonitions, which, as he declares himself, he frequently received in
visions and ecstacies, were the reasons alleged in his justification.
^79 But his best apology may be found in the cheerful resolution, with
which, about eight years afterwards, he suffered death in the cause of
religion. The authentic history of his martyrdom has been recorded with
unusual candor and impartiality. A short abstract, therefore, of its
most important circumstances, will convey the clearest information of
the spirit, and of the forms, of the Roman persecutions. ^80</p>
<p>[Footnote 76: The letters of Cyprian exhibit a very curious and
original picture both of the man and of the times. See likewise the two
lives of Cyprian, composed with equal accuracy, though with very
different views; the one by Le Clerc (Bibliotheque Universelle, tom.
xii. p. 208-378,) the other by Tillemont, Memoires Ecclesiastiques, tom.
iv part i. p. 76-459.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 77: See the polite but severe epistle of the clergy of Rome
to the bishop of Carthage. (Cyprian. Epist. 8, 9.) Pontius labors with
the greatest care and diligence to justify his master against the
general censure.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 78: In particular those of Dionysius of Alexandria, and
Gregory Thaumaturgus, of Neo-Caesarea. See Euseb. Hist. Ecclesiast. l.
vi. c. 40; and Memoires de Tillemont, tom. iv. part ii. p. 685.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 79: See Cyprian. Epist. 16, and his life by Pontius.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 80: We have an original life of Cyprian by the deacon
Pontius, the companion of his exile, and the spectator of his death; and
we likewise possess the ancient proconsular acts of his martyrdom. These
two relations are consistent with each other, and with probability; and
what is somewhat remarkable, they are both unsullied by any miraculous
circumstances.]</p>
