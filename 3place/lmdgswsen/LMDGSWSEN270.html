LXII: Greek Emperors Of Nice And Constantinople.</h4>
<p>Part III.</p>
<p>I shall not, I trust, be accused of superstition; but I must remark
that, even in this world, the natural order of events will sometimes
afford the strong appearances of moral retribution. The first
Palaeologus had saved his empire by involving the kingdoms of the West
in rebellion and blood; and from these scenes of discord uprose a
generation of iron men, who assaulted and endangered the empire of his
son. In modern times our debts and taxes are the secret poison which
still corrodes the bosom of peace: but in the weak and disorderly
government of the middle ages, it was agitated by the present evil of
the disbanded armies. Too idle to work, too proud to beg, the
mercenaries were accustomed to a life of rapine: they could rob with
more dignity and effect under a banner and a chief; and the sovereign,
to whom their service was useless, and their presence importunate,
endeavored to discharge the torrent on some neighboring countries. After
the peace of Sicily, many thousands of Genoese, Catalans, ^47
andandandandc., who had fought, by sea and land, under the standard of
Anjou or Arragon, were blended into one nation by the resemblance of
their manners and interest. They heard that the Greek provinces of Asia
were invaded by the Turks: they resolved to share the harvest of pay and
plunder: and Frederic king of Sicily most liberally contributed the
means of their departure. In a warfare of twenty years, a ship, or a
camp, was become their country; arms were their sole profession and
property; valor was the only virtue which they knew; their women had
imbibed the fearless temper of their lovers and husbands: it was
reported, that, with a stroke of their broadsword, the Catalans could
cleave a horseman and a horse; and the report itself was a powerful
weapon. Roger de Flor ^* was the most popular of their chiefs; and his
personal merit overshadowed the dignity of his prouder rivals of
Arragon. The offspring of a marriage between a German gentleman of the
court of Frederic the Second and a damsel of Brindisi, Roger was
successively a templar, an apostate, a pirate, and at length the richest
and most powerful admiral of the Mediterranean. He sailed from Messina
to Constantinople, with eighteen galleys, four great ships, and eight
thousand adventurers; ^* and his previous treaty was faithfully
accomplished by Andronicus the elder, who accepted with joy and terror
this formidable succor. A palace was allotted for his reception, and a
niece of the emperor was given in marriage to the valiant stranger, who
was immediately created great duke or admiral of Romania. After a decent
repose, he transported his troops over the Propontis, and boldly led
them against the Turks: in two bloody battles thirty thousand of the
Moslems were slain: he raised the siege of Philadelphia, and deserved
the name of the deliverer of Asia. But after a short season of
prosperity, the cloud of slavery and ruin again burst on that unhappy
province. The inhabitants escaped (says a Greek historian) from the
smoke into the flames; and the hostility of the Turks was less
pernicious than the friendship of the Catalans. ^! The lives and
fortunes which they had rescued they considered as their own: the
willing or reluctant maid was saved from the race of circumcision for
the embraces of a Christian soldier: the exaction of fines and supplies
was enforced by licentious rapine and arbitrary executions; and, on the
resistance of Magnesia, the great duke besieged a city of the Roman
empire. ^48 These disorders he excused by the wrongs and passions of a
victorious army; nor would his own authority or person have been safe,
had he dared to punish his faithful followers, who were defrauded of the
just and covenanted price of their services. The threats and complaints
of Andronicus disclosed the nakedness of the empire. His golden bull had
invited no more than five hundred horse and a thousand foot soldiers;
yet the crowds of volunteers, who migrated to the East, had been
enlisted and fed by his spontaneous bounty. While his bravest allies
were content with three byzants or pieces of gold, for their monthly
pay, an ounce, or even two ounces, of gold were assigned to the
Catalans, whose annual pension would thus amount to near a hundred
pounds sterling: one of their chiefs had modestly rated at three hundred
thousand crowns the value of his future merits; and above a million had
been issued from the treasury for the maintenance of these costly
mercenaries. A cruel tax had been imposed on the corn of the husbandman:
one third was retrenched from the salaries of the public officers; and
the standard of the coin was so shamefully debased, that of the
four-and-twenty parts only five were of pure gold. ^49 At the summons of
the emperor, Roger evacuated a province which no longer supplied the
materials of rapine; ^* but he refused to disperse his troops; and while
his style was respectful, his conduct was independent and hostile. He
protested, that if the emperor should march against him, he would
advance forty paces to kiss the ground before him; but in rising from
this prostrate attitude Roger had a life and sword at the service of his
friends. The great duke of Romania condescended to accept the title and
ornaments of Caesar; but he rejected the new proposal of the government
of Asia with a subsidy of corn and money, ^* on condition that he should
reduce his troops to the harmless number of three thousand men.
Assassination is the last resource of cowards. The Caesar was tempted to
visit the royal residence of Adrianople; in the apartment, and before
the eyes, of the empress he was stabbed by the Alani guards; and though
the deed was imputed to their private revenge, ^!! his countrymen, who
dwelt at Constantinople in the security of peace, were involved in the
same proscription by the prince or people. The loss of their leader
intimidated the crowd of adventurers, who hoisted the sails of flight,
and were soon scattered round the coasts of the Mediterranean. But a
veteran band of fifteen hundred Catalans, or French, stood firm in the
strong fortress of Gallipoli on the Hellespont, displayed the banners of
Arragon, and offered to revenge and justify their chief, by an equal
combat of ten or a hundred warriors. Instead of accepting this bold
defiance, the emperor Michael, the son and colleague of Andronicus,
resolved to oppress them with the weight of multitudes: every nerve was
strained to form an army of thirteen thousand horse and thirty thousand
foot; and the Propontis was covered with the ships of the Greeks and
Genoese. In two battles by sea and land, these mighty forces were
encountered and overthrown by the despair and discipline of the
Catalans: the young emperor fled to the palace; and an insufficient
guard of light-horse was left for the protection of the open country.
Victory renewed the hopes and numbers of the adventures: every nation
was blended under the name and standard of the great company; and three
thousand Turkish proselytes deserted from the Imperial service to join
this military association. In the possession of Gallipoli, ^!!! the
Catalans intercepted the trade of Constantinople and the Black Sea,
while they spread their devastation on either side of the Hellespont
over the confines of Europe and Asia. To prevent their approach, the
greatest part of the Byzantine territory was laid waste by the Greeks
themselves: the peasants and their cattle retired into the city; and
myriads of sheep and oxen, for which neither place nor food could be
procured, were unprofitably slaughtered on the same day. Four times the
emperor Andronicus sued for peace, and four times he was inflexibly
repulsed, till the want of provisions, and the discord of the chiefs,
compelled the Catalans to evacuate the banks of the Hellespont and the
neighborhood of the capital. After their separation from the Turks, the
remains of the great company pursued their march through Macedonia and
Thessaly, to seek a new establishment in the heart of Greece. ^50</p>
<p>[Footnote 47: In this motley multitude, the Catalans and Spaniards,
the bravest of the soldiery, were styled by themselves and the Greeks
Amogavares. Moncada derives their origin from the Goths, and Pachymer
(l. xi. c. 22) from the Arabs; and in spite of national and religious
pride, I am afraid the latter is in the right.]</p>
<p>[Footnote *: On Roger de Flor and his companions, see an historical
fragment, detailed and interesting, entitled “The Spaniards of the
Fourteenth Century,“ and inserted in “L’Espagne en 1808,“ a work
translated from the German, vol. ii. p. 167. This narrative enables us
to detect some slight errors which have crept into that of Gibbon. -
G.]</p>
<p>[Footnote *: The troops of Roger de Flor, according to his companions
Ramon de Montaner, were 1500 men at arms, 4000 Almogavares, and 1040
other foot, besides the sailors and mariners, vol. ii. p. 137. - M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote !: Ramon de Montaner suppresses the cruelties and
oppressions of the Catalans, in which, perhaps, he shared. - M]</p>
<p>[Footnote 48: Some idea may be formed of the population of these
cities, from the 36,000 inhabitants of Tralles, which, in the preceding
reign, was rebuilt by the emperor, and ruined by the Turks. (Pachymer,
l. vi. c. 20, 21.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 49: I have collected these pecuniary circumstances from
Pachymer, (l. xi. c. 21, l. xii. c. 4, 5, 8, 14, 19,) who describes the
progressive degradation of the gold coin. Even in the prosperous times
of John Ducas Vataces, the byzants were composed in equal proportions of
the pure and the baser metal. The poverty of Michael Palaeologus
compelled him to strike a new coin, with nine parts, or carats, of gold,
and fifteen of copper alloy. After his death, the standard rose to ten
carats, till in the public distress it was reduced to the moiety. The
prince was relieved for a moment, while credit and commerce were forever
blasted. In France, the gold coin is of twenty-two carats, (one twelfth
alloy,) and the standard of England and Holland is still higher.]</p>
<p>[Footnote *: Roger de Flor, according to Ramon de Montaner, was
recalled from Natolia, on account of the war which had arisen on the
death of Asan, king of Bulgaria. Andronicus claimed the kingdom for his
nephew, the sons of Asan by his sister. Roger de Flor turned the tide of
success in favor of the emperor of Constantinople and made peace. -
M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote *: Andronicus paid the Catalans in the debased money, much
to their indignation. - M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote !!: According to Ramon de Montaner, he was murdered by
order of Kyr Michael, son of the emperor. p. 170. - M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote !!!: Ramon de Montaner describes his sojourn at Gallipoli:
Nous etions si riches, que nous ne semions, ni ne labourions, ni ne
faisions enver des vins ni ne cultivions les vignes: et cependant tous
les ans nous recucillions tour ce qu’il nous fallait, en vin, froment et
avoine. p. 193. This lasted for five merry years. Ramon de Montaner is
high authority, for he was “chancelier et maitre rational de l’armee,“
(commissary of rations.) He was left governor; all the scribes of the
army remained with him, and with their aid he kept the books in which
were registered the number of horse and foot employed on each
expedition. According to this book the plunder was shared, of which he
had a fifth for his trouble. p. 197. - M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 50: The Catalan war is most copiously related by Pachymer,
in the xith, xiith, and xiiith books, till he breaks off in the year
1308. Nicephorus Gregoras (l. vii. 3 - 6) is more concise and complete.
Ducange, who adopts these adventurers as French, has hunted their
footsteps with his usual diligence, (Hist. de C. P. l. vi. c. 22 - 46.)
He quotes an Arragonese history, which I have read with pleasure, and
which the Spaniards extol as a model of style and composition,
(Expedicion de los Catalanes y Arragoneses contra Turcos y Griegos:
Barcelona, 1623 in quarto: Madrid, 1777, in octavo.) Don Francisco de
Moncada Conde de Ossona, may imitate Caesar or Sallust; he may
transcribe the Greek or Italian contemporaries: but he never quotes his
authorities, and I cannot discern any national records of the exploits
of his countrymen.</p>
<p>Note: Ramon de Montaner, one of the Catalans, who accompanied Roger
de Flor, and who was governor of Gallipoli, has written, in Spanish, the
history of this band of adventurers, to which he belonged, and from
which he separated when it left the Thracian Chersonese to penetrate
into Macedonia and Greece. - G.</p>
<p>The autobiography of Ramon de Montaner has been published in French
by M. Buchon, in the great collection of Memoires relatifs a l’Histoire
de France. I quote this edition. - M.]</p>
<p>After some ages of oblivion, Greece was awakened to new misfortunes
by the arms of the Latins. In the two hundred and fifty years between
the first and the last conquest of Constantinople, that venerable land
was disputed by a multitude of petty tyrants; without the comforts of
freedom and genius, her ancient cities were again plunged in foreign and
intestine war; and, if servitude be preferable to anarchy, they might
repose with joy under the Turkish yoke. I shall not pursue the obscure
and various dynasties, that rose and fell on the continent or in the
isles; but our silence on the fate of Athens ^51 would argue a strange
ingratitude to the first and purest school of liberal science and
amusement. In the partition of the empire, the principality of Athens
and Thebes was assigned to Otho de la Roche, a noble warrior of
Burgundy, ^52 with the title of great duke, ^53 which the Latins
understood in their own sense, and the Greeks more foolishly derived
from the age of Constantine. ^54 Otho followed the standard of the
marquis of Montferrat: the ample state which he acquired by a miracle of
conduct or fortune, ^55 was peaceably inherited by his son and two
grandsons, till the family, though not the nation, was changed, by the
marriage of an heiress into the elder branch of the house of Brienne.
The son of that marriage, Walter de Brienne, succeeded to the duchy of
Athens; and, with the aid of some Catalan mercenaries, whom he invested
with fiefs, reduced above thirty castles of the vassal or neighboring
lords. But when he was informed of the approach and ambition of the
great company, he collected a force of seven hundred knights, six
thousand four hundred horse, and eight thousand foot, and boldly met
them on the banks of the River Cephisus in Boeotia. The Catalans
amounted to no more than three thousand five hundred horse, and four
thousand foot; but the deficiency of numbers was compensated by
stratagem and order. They formed round their camp an artificial
inundation; the duke and his knights advanced without fear or precaution
on the verdant meadow; their horses plunged into the bog; and he was cut
in pieces, with the greatest part of the French cavalry. His family and
nation were expelled; and his son Walter de Brienne, the titular duke of
Athens, the tyrant of Florence, and the constable of France, lost his
life in the field of Poitiers Attica and Boeotia were the rewards of the
victorious Catalans; they married the widows and daughters of the slain;
and during fourteen years, the great company was the terror of the
Grecian states. Their factions drove them to acknowledge the sovereignty
of the house of Arragon; and during the remainder of the fourteenth
century, Athens, as a government or an appanage, was successively
bestowed by the kings of Sicily. After the French and Catalans, the
third dynasty was that of the Accaioli, a family, plebeian at Florence,
potent at Naples, and sovereign in Greece. Athens, which they
embellished with new buildings, became the capital of a state, that
extended over Thebes, Argos, Corinth, Delphi, and a part of Thessaly;
and their reign was finally determined by Mahomet the Second, who
strangled the last duke, and educated his sons in the discipline and
religion of the seraglio.</p>
<p>[Footnote 51: See the laborious history of Ducange, whose accurate
table of the French dynasties recapitulates the thirty-five passages, in
which he mentions the dukes of Athens.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 52: He is twice mentioned by Villehardouin with honor,
(No. 151, 235;) and under the first passage, Ducange observes all that
can be known of his person and family.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 53: From these Latin princes of the xivth century, Boccace,
Chaucer. and Shakspeare, have borrowed their Theseus duke of Athens. An
ignorant age transfers its own language and manners to the most distant
times.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 54: The same Constantine gave to Sicily a king, to Russia
the magnus dapifer of the empire, to Thebes the primicerius; and these
absurd fables are properly lashed by Ducange, (ad Nicephor. Greg. l.
vii. c. 5.) By the Latins, the lord of Thebes was styled, by corruption,
the Megas Kurios, or Grand Sire!]</p>
<p>[Footnote 55: Quodam miraculo, says Alberic. He was probably received
by Michael Choniates, the archbishop who had defended Athens against the
tyrant Leo Sgurus, (Nicetas urbs capta, p. 805, ed. Bek.) Michael was
the brother of the historian Nicetas; and his encomium of Athens is
still extant in Ms. in the Bodleian library, (Fabric. Bibliot. Graec
tom. vi. p. 405.) Note: Nicetas says expressly that Michael surrendered
the Acropolis to the marquis. - M.]</p>
<p>Athens, ^56 though no more than the shadow of her former self, still
contains about eight or ten thousand inhabitants; of these, three
fourths are Greeks in religion and language; and the Turks, who compose
the remainder, have relaxed, in their intercourse with the citizens,
somewhat of the pride and gravity of their national character. The
olive-tree, the gift of Minerva, flourishes in Attica; nor has the honey
of Mount Hymettus lost any part of its exquisite flavor: ^57 but the
languid trade is monopolized by strangers, and the agriculture of a
barren land is abandoned to the vagrant Walachians. The Athenians are
still distinguished by the subtlety and acuteness of their
understandings; but these qualities, unless ennobled by freedom, and
enlightened by study, will degenerate into a low and selfish cunning:
and it is a proverbial saying of the country, “From the Jews of
Thessalonica, the Turks of Negropont, and the Greeks of Athens, good
Lord deliver us!“ This artful people has eluded the tyranny of the
Turkish bashaws, by an expedient which alleviates their servitude and
aggravates their shame. About the middle of the last century, the
Athenians chose for their protector the Kislar Aga, or chief black
eunuch of the seraglio. This Aethiopian slave, who possesses the
sultan’s ear, condescends to accept the tribute of thirty thousand
crowns: his lieutenant, the Waywode, whom he annually confirms, may
reserve for his own about five or six thousand more; and such is the
policy of the citizens, that they seldom fail to remove and punish an
oppressive governor. Their private differences are decided by the
archbishop, one of the richest prelates of the Greek church, since he
possesses a revenue of one thousand pounds sterling; and by a tribunal
of the eight geronti or elders, chosen in the eight quarters of the
city: the noble families cannot trace their pedigree above three hundred
years; but their principal members are distinguished by a grave
demeanor, a fur cap, and the lofty appellation of archon. By some, who
delight in the contrast, the modern language of Athens is represented as
the most corrupt and barbarous of the seventy dialects of the vulgar
Greek: ^58 this picture is too darkly colored: but it would not be easy,
in the country of Plato and Demosthenes, to find a reader or a copy of
their works. The Athenians walk with supine indifference among the
glorious ruins of antiquity; and such is the debasement of their
character, that they are incapable of admiring the genius of their
predecessors. ^59</p>
<p>[Footnote 56: The modern account of Athens, and the Athenians, is
extracted from Spon, (Voyage en Grece, tom. ii. p. 79 - 199,) and
Wheeler, (Travels into Greece, p. 337 - 414,) Stuart, (Antiquities of
Athens, passim,) and Chandler, (Travels into Greece, p. 23 - 172.) The
first of these travellers visited Greece in the year 1676; the last,
1765; and ninety years had not produced much difference in the tranquil
scene.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 57: The ancients, or at least the Athenians, believed that
all the bees in the world had been propagated from Mount Hymettus. They
taught, that health might be preserved, and life prolonged, by the
external use of oil, and the internal use of honey, (Geoponica, l. xv. c
7, p. 1089 - 1094, edit. Niclas.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 58: Ducange, Glossar. Graec. Praefat. p. 8, who quotes for
his author Theodosius Zygomalas, a modern grammarian. Yet Spon (tom. ii.
p. 194) and Wheeler, (p. 355,) no incompetent judges, entertain a more
favorable opinion of the Attic dialect.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 59: Yet we must not accuse them of corrupting the name of
Athens, which they still call Athini. We have formed our own barbarism
of Setines.</p>
<p>Note: Gibbon did not foresee a Bavarian prince on the throne of
Greece, with Athens as his capital. - M.]</p>
