<p>Part I.</p>
<p>Preservation Of The Greek Empire. - Numbers, Passage, And Event, Of
The Second And Third Crusades. - St. Bernard. - Reign Of Saladin In
Egypt And Syria. - His Conquest Of Jerusalem. - Naval Crusades. -
Richard The First Of England. - Pope Innocent The Third; And The Fourth
And Fifth Crusades. - The Emperor Frederic The Second. - Louis The Ninth
Of France; And The Two Last Crusades. - Expulsion Of The Latins Or
Franks By The Mamelukes.</p>
<p>In a style less grave than that of history, I should perhaps compare
the emperor Alexius ^1 to the jackal, who is said to follow the steps,
and to devour the leavings, of the lion. Whatever had been his fears and
toils in the passage of the first crusade, they were amply recompensed
by the subsequent benefits which he derived from the exploits of the
Franks. His dexterity and vigilance secured their first conquest of
Nice; and from this threatening station the Turks were compelled to
evacuate the neighborhood of Constantinople. While the crusaders, with
blind valor, advanced into the midland countries of Asia, the crafty
Greek improved the favorable occasion when the emirs of the sea-coast
were recalled to the standard of the sultan. The Turks were driven from
the Isles of Rhodes and Chios: the cities of Ephesu and Smyrna, of
Sardes, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, were restored to the empire, which
Alexius enlarged from the Hellespont to the banks of the Maeander, and
the rocky shores of Pamphylia. The churches resumed their splendor: the
towns were rebuilt and fortified; and the desert country was peopled
with colonies of Christians, who were gently removed from the more
distant and dangerous frontier. In these paternal cares, we may forgive
Alexius, if he forgot the deliverance of the holy sepulchre; but, by the
Latins, he was stigmatized with the foul reproach of treason and
desertion. They had sworn fidelity and obedience to his throne; but he
had promised to assist their enterprise in person, or, at least, with
his troops and treasures: his base retreat dissolved their obligations;
and the sword, which had been the instrument of their victory, was the
pledge and title of their just independence. It does not appear that the
emperor attempted to revive his obsolete claims over the kingdom of
Jerusalem; ^2 but the borders of Cilicia and Syria were more recent in
his possession, and more accessible to his arms. The great army of the
crusaders was annihilated or dispersed; the principality of Antioch was
left without a head, by the surprise and captivity of Bohemond; his
ransom had oppressed him with a heavy debt; and his Norman followers
were insufficient to repel the hostilities of the Greeks and Turks. In
this distress, Bohemond embraced a magnanimous resolution, of leaving
the defence of Antioch to his kinsman, the faithful Tancred; of arming
the West against the Byzantine empire; and of executing the design which
he inherited from the lessons and example of his father Guiscard. His
embarkation was clandestine: and, if we may credit a tale of the
princess Anne, he passed the hostile sea closely secreted in a coffin.
^3 But his reception in France was dignified by the public applause, and
his marriage with the king’s daughter: his return was glorious, since
the bravest spirits of the age enlisted under his veteran command; and
he repassed the Adriatic at the head of five thousand horse and forty
thousand foot, assembled from the most remote climates of Europe. ^4 The
strength of Durazzo, and prudence of Alexius, the progress of famine and
approach of winter, eluded his ambitious hopes; and the venal
confederates were seduced from his standard. A treaty of peace ^5
suspended the fears of the Greeks; and they were finally delivered by
the death of an adversary, whom neither oaths could bind, nor dangers
could appal, nor prosperity could satiate. His children succeeded to the
principality of Antioch; but the boundaries were strictly defined, the
homage was clearly stipulated, and the cities of Tarsus and Malmistra
were restored to the Byzantine emperors. Of the coast of Anatolia, they
possessed the entire circuit from Trebizond to the Syrian gates. The
Seljukian dynasty of Roum ^6 was separated on all sides from the sea and
their Mussulman brethren; the power of the sultan was shaken by the
victories and even the defeats of the Franks; and after the loss of
Nice, they removed their throne to Cogni or Iconium, an obscure and in
land town above three hundred miles from Constantinople. ^7 Instead of
trembling for their capital, the Comnenian princes waged an offensive
war against the Turks, and the first crusade prevented the fall of the
declining empire.</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: Anna Comnena relates her father’s conquests in Asia
Minor Alexiad, l. xi. p. 321 - 325, l. xiv. p. 419; his Cilician war
against Tancred and Bohemond, p. 328 - 324; the war of Epirus, with
tedious prolixity, l. xii. xiii. p. 345 - 406; the death of Bohemond, l.
xiv. p. 419.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: The kings of Jerusalem submitted, however, to a nominal
dependence, and in the dates of their inscriptions, (one is still
legible in the church of Bethlem,) they respectfully placed before their
own the name of the reigning emperor, (Ducange, Dissertations sur
Joinville xxvii. p. 319.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: Anna Comnena adds, that, to complete the imitation, he
was shut up with a dead cock; and condescends to wonder how the
Barbarian could endure the confinement and putrefaction. This absurd
tale is unknown to the Latins. Note: The Greek writers, in general,
Zonaras, p. 2, 303, and Glycas, p. 334 agree in this story with the
princess Anne, except in the absurd addition of the dead cock. Ducange
has already quoted some instances where a similar stratagem had been
adopted by Norman princes. On this authority Wilker inclines to believe
the fact. Appendix to vol. ii. p. 14. - M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: In the Byzantine geography, must mean England; yet we
are more credibly informed, that our Henry I. would not suffer him to
levy any troops in his kingdom, (Ducange, Not. ad Alexiad. p. 41.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: The copy of the treaty (Alexiad. l. xiii. p. 406 - 416)
is an original and curious piece, which would require, and might afford,
a good map of the principality of Antioch.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: See, in the learned work of M. De Guignes, (tom. ii.
part ii.,) the history of the Seljukians of Iconium, Aleppo, and
Damascus, as far as it may be collected from the Greeks, Latins, and
Arabians. The last are ignorant or regardless of the affairs of
Roum.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: Iconium is mentioned as a station by Xenophon, and by
Strabo, with an ambiguous title, (Cellarius, tom. ii. p. 121.) Yet
St. Paul found in that place a multitude of Jews and Gentiles. under the
corrupt name of Kunijah, it is described as a great city, with a river
and garden, three leagues from the mountains, and decorated (I know not
why) with Plato’s tomb, (Abulfeda, tabul. xvii. p. 303 vers. Reiske; and
the Index Geographicus of Schulrens from Ibn Said.)]</p>
<p>In the twelfth century, three great emigrations marched by land from
the West for the relief of Palestine. The soldiers and pilgrims of
Lombardy, France, and Germany were excited by the example and success of
the first crusade. ^8 Forty-eight years after the deliverance of the
holy sepulchre, the emperor, and the French king, Conrad the Third and
Louis the Seventh, undertook the second crusade to support the falling
fortunes of the Latins. ^9 A grand division of the third crusade was led
by the emperor Frederic Barbarossa, ^10 who sympathized with his
brothers of France and England in the common loss of Jerusalem. These
three expeditions may be compared in their resemblance of the greatness
of numbers, their passage through the Greek empire, and the nature and
event of their Turkish warfare, and a brief parallel may save the
repetition of a tedious narrative. However splendid it may seem, a
regular story of the crusades would exhibit the perpetual return of the
same causes and effects; and the frequent attempts for the defence or
recovery of the Holy Land would appear so many faint and unsuccessful
copies of the original.</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: For this supplement to the first crusade, see Anna
Comnena, Alexias, l. xi. p. 331, andandandandc., and the viiith book of
Albert Aquensis.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: For the second crusade, of Conrad III. and Louis VII.,
see William of Tyre, (l. xvi. c. 18 - 19,) Otho of Frisingen, (l. i.
c. 34 - 45 59, 60,) Matthew Paris, (Hist. Major. p. 68,) Struvius,

<p>[Footnote 10: For the third crusade, of Frederic Barbarossa, see
Nicetas in Isaac Angel. l. ii. c. 3 - 8, p. 257 - 266. Struv. (Corpus.
Hist. Germ. p. 414,) and two historians, who probably were spectators,
Tagino, (in Scriptor. Freher. tom. i. p. 406 - 416, edit Struv.,) and
the Anonymus de Expeditione Asiatica Fred. I. (in Canisii Antiq.
Lection. tom. iii. p. ii. p. 498 - 526, edit. Basnage.)]</p>
<p>I. Of the swarms that so closely trod in the footsteps of the first
pilgrims, the chiefs were equal in rank, though unequal in fame and
merit, to Godfrey of Bouillon and his fellow-adventurers. At their head
were displayed the banners of the dukes of Burgundy, Bavaria, and
Aquitain; the first a descendant of Hugh Capet, the second, a father of
the Brunswick line: the archbishop of Milan, a temporal prince,
transported, for the benefit of the Turks, the treasures and ornaments
of his church and palace; and the veteran crusaders, Hugh the Great and
Stephen of Chartres, returned to consummate their unfinished vow.</p>
<p>The huge and disorderly bodies of their followers moved forward in
two columns; and if the first consisted of two hundred and sixty
thousand persons, the second might possibly amount to sixty thousand
horse and one hundred thousand foot. ^11 ^* The armies of the second
crusade might have claimed the conquest of Asia; the nobles of France
and Germany were animated by the presence of their sovereigns; and both
the rank and personal character of Conrad and Louis gave a dignity to
their cause, and a discipline to their force, which might be vainly
expected from the feudatory chiefs. The cavalry of the emperor, and that
of the king, was each composed of seventy thousand knights, and their
immediate attendants in the field; ^12 and if the light-armed troops,
the peasant infantry, the women and children, the priests and monks, be
rigorously excluded, the full account will scarcely be satisfied with
four hundred thousand souls. The West, from Rome to Britain, was called
into action; the kings of Poland and Bohemia obeyed the summons of
Conrad; and it is affirmed by the Greeks and Latins, that, in the
passage of a strait or river, the Byzantine agents, after a tale of nine
hundred thousand, desisted from the endless and formidable computation.
^13 In the third crusade, as the French and English preferred the
navigation of the Mediterranean, the host of Frederic Barbarossa was
less numerous. Fifteen thousand knights, and as many squires, were the
flower of the German chivalry: sixty thousand horse, and one hundred
thousand foot, were mustered by the emperor in the plains of Hungary;
and after such repetitions, we shall no longer be startled at the six
hundred thousand pilgrims, which credulity has ascribed to this last
emigration. ^14 Such extravagant reckonings prove only the astonishment
of contemporaries; but their astonishment most strongly bears testimony
to the existence of an enormous, though indefinite, multitude. The
Greeks might applaud their superior knowledge of the arts and stratagems
of war, but they confessed the strength and courage of the French
cavalry, and the infantry of the Germans; ^15 and the strangers are
described as an iron race, of gigantic stature, who darted fire from
their eyes, and spilt blood like water on the ground. Under the banners
of Conrad, a troop of females rode in the attitude and armor of men; and
the chief of these Amazons, from her gilt spurs and buskins, obtained
the epithet of the Golden- footed Dame.</p>
<p>[Footnote 11: Anne, who states these later swarms at 40,000 horse and
100,000 foot, calls them Normans, and places at their head two brothers
of Flanders. The Greeks were strangely ignorant of the names, families,
and possessions of the Latin princes.]</p>
<p>[Footnote *: It was this army of pilgrims, the first body of which
was headed by the archbishop of Milan and Count Albert of Blandras,
which set forth on the wild, yet, with a more disciplined army, not
impolitic, enterprise of striking at the heart of the Mahometan power,
by attacking the sultan in Bagdad. For their adventures and fate, see
Wilken, vol. ii. p. 120, andandandandc., Wichaud, book iv. - M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 12: William of Tyre, and Matthew Paris, reckon 70,000
loricati in each of the armies.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 13: The imperfect enumeration is mentioned by Cinnamus, and
confirmed by Odo de Diogilo apud Ducange ad Cinnamum, with the more
precise sum of 900,556. Why must therefore the version and comment
suppose the modest and insufficient reckoning of 90,000? Does not
Godfrey of Viterbo (Pantheon, p. xix. in Muratori, tom. vii. p. 462)
exclaim?</p>
<ul>
<li>Numerum si poscere quaeras, Millia millena militis agmen erat.]</li>
</ul>
<p>[Footnote 14: This extravagant account is given by Albert of Stade,
(apud Struvium, p. 414;) my calculation is borrowed from Godfrey of
Viterbo, Arnold of Lubeck, apud eundem, and Bernard Thesaur. (c. 169,
p. 804.) The original writers are silent. The Mahometans gave him
200,000, or 260,000, men, (Bohadin, in Vit. Saladin, p. 110.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 15: I must observe, that, in the second and third crusades,
the subjects of Conrad and Frederic are styled by the Greeks and
Orientals Alamanni. The Lechi and Tzechi of Cinnamus are the Poles and
Bohemians; and it is for the French that he reserves the ancient
appellation of Germans. Note: He names both - M.]</p>

<li>The number and character of the strangers was an object of terror to
the effeminate Greeks, and the sentiment of fear is nearly allied to
that of hatred. This aversion was suspended or softened by the
apprehension of the Turkish power; and the invectives of the Latins will
not bias our more candid belief, that the emperor Alexius dissembled
their insolence, eluded their hostilities, counselled their rashness,
and opened to their ardor the road of pilgrimage and conquest. But when
the Turks had been driven from Nice and the sea-coast, when the
Byzantine princes no longer dreaded the distant sultans of Cogni, they
felt with purer indignation the free and frequent passage of the western
Barbarians, who violated the majesty, and endangered the safety, of the
empire. The second and third crusades were undertaken under the reign of
Manuel Comnenus and Isaac Angelus. Of the former, the passions were
always impetuous, and often malevolent; and the natural union of a
cowardly and a mischievous temper was exemplified in the latter, who,
without merit or mercy, could punish a tyrant, and occupy his throne. It
was secretly, and perhaps tacitly, resolved by the prince and people to
destroy, or at least to discourage, the pilgrims, by every species of
injury and oppression; and their want of prudence and discipline
continually afforded the pretence or the opportunity. The Western
monarchs had stipulated a safe passage and fair market in the country of
their Christian brethren; the treaty had been ratified by oaths and
hostages; and the poorest soldier of Frederic’s army was furnished with
three marks of silver to defray his expenses on the road. But every
engagement was violated by treachery and injustice; and the complaints
of the Latins are attested by the honest confession of a Greek
historian, who has dared to prefer truth to his country. ^16 Instead of
a hospitable reception, the gates of the cities, both in Europe and
Asia, were closely barred against the crusaders; and the scanty pittance
of food was let down in baskets from the walls. Experience or foresight
might excuse this timid jealousy; but the common duties of humanity
prohibited the mixture of chalk, or other poisonous ingredients, in the
bread; and should Manuel be acquitted of any foul connivance, he is
guilty of coining base money for the purpose of trading with the
pilgrims. In every step of their march they were stopped or misled: the
governors had private orders to fortify the passes and break down the
bridges against them: the stragglers were pillaged and murdered: the
soldiers and horses were pierced in the woods by arrows from an
invisible hand; the sick were burnt in their beds; and the dead bodies
were hung on gibbets along the highways. These injuries exasperated the
champions of the cross, who were not endowed with evangelical patience;
and the Byzantine princes, who had provoked the unequal conflict,
promoted the embarkation and march of these formidable guests. On the
verge of the Turkish frontier Barbarossa spared the guilty Philadelphia,
^17 rewarded the hospitable Laodicea, and deplored the hard necessity
that had stained his sword with any drops of Christian blood. In their
intercourse with the monarchs of Germany and France, the pride of the
Greeks was exposed to an anxious trial. They might boast that on the
first interview the seat of Louis was a low stool, beside the throne of
Manuel; ^18 but no sooner had the French king transported his army
beyond the Bosphorus, than he refused the offer of a second conference,
unless his brother would meet him on equal terms, either on the sea or
land. With Conrad and Frederic, the ceremonial was still nicer and more
difficult: like the successors of Constantine, they styled themselves
emperors of the Romans; ^19 and firmly maintained the purity of their
title and dignity. The first of these representatives of Charlemagne
would only converse with Manuel on horseback in the open field; the
second, by passing the Hellespont rather than the Bosphorus, declined
the view of Constantinople and its sovereign. An emperor, who had been
crowned at Rome, was reduced in the Greek epistles to the humble
appellation of Rex, or prince, of the Alemanni; and the vain and feeble
Angelus affected to be ignorant of the name of one of the greatest men
and monarchs of the age. While they viewed with hatred and suspicion the
Latin pilgrims the Greek emperors maintained a strict, though secret,
alliance with the Turks and Saracens. Isaac Angelus complained, that by
his friendship for the great Saladin he had incurred the enmity of the
Franks; and a mosque was founded at Constantinople for the public
exercise of the religion of Mahomet. ^20</li>

<p>[Footnote 16: Nicetas was a child at the second crusade, but in the
third he commanded against the Franks the important post of
Philippopolis. Cinnamus is infected with national prejudice and
pride.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 17: The conduct of the Philadelphians is blamed by Nicetas,
while the anonymous German accuses the rudeness of his countrymen,
(culpa nostra.) History would be pleasant, if we were embarrassed only
by such contradictions. It is likewise from Nicetas, that we learn the
pious and humane sorrow of Frederic.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 18: Cinnamus translates into Latin. Ducange works very hard
to save his king and country from such ignominy, (sur Joinville,
dissertat. xxvii. p. 317 - 320.) Louis afterwards insisted on a meeting
in mari ex aequo, not ex equo, according to the laughable readings of
some MSS.]</p>

<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>The swarms that followed the first crusade were destroyed in
Anatolia by famine, pestilence, and the Turkish arrows; and the princes
only escaped with some squadrons of horse to accomplish their lamentable
pilgrimage. A just opinion may be formed of their knowledge and
humanity; of their knowledge, from the design of subduing Persia and
Chorasan in their way to Jerusalem; ^* of their humanity, from the
massacre of the Christian people, a friendly city, who came out to meet
them with palms and crosses in their hands. The arms of Conrad and Louis
were less cruel and imprudent; but the event of the second crusade was
still more ruinous to Christendom; and the Greek Manuel is accused by
his own subjects of giving seasonable intelligence to the sultan, and
treacherous guides to the Latin princes. Instead of crushing the common
foe, by a double attack at the same time but on different sides, the
Germans were urged by emulation, and the French were retarded by
jealousy. Louis had scarcely passed the Bosphorus when he was met by the
returning emperor, who had lost the greater part of his army in
glorious, but unsuccessful, actions on the banks of the Maender. The
contrast of the pomp of his rival hastened the retreat of Conrad: ^! the
desertion of his independent vassals reduced him to his hereditary
troops; and he borrowed some Greek vessels to execute by sea the
pilgrimage of Palestine. Without studying the lessons of experience, or
the nature of the war, the king of France advanced through the same
country to a similar fate. The vanguard, which bore the royal banner and
the oriflamme of St. Denys, ^21 had doubled their march with rash and
inconsiderate speed; and the rear, which the king commanded in person,
no longer found their companions in the evening camp. In darkness and
disorder, they were encompassed, assaulted, and overwhelmed, by the
innumerable host of Turks, who, in the art of war, were superior to the
Christians of the twelfth century. ^* Louis, who climbed a tree in the
general discomfiture, was saved by his own valor and the ignorance of
his adversaries; and with the dawn of day he escaped alive, but almost
alone, to the camp of the vanguard. But instead of pursuing his
expedition by land, he was rejoiced to shelter the relics of his army in
the friendly seaport of Satalia. From thence he embarked for Antioch;
but so penurious was the supply of Greek vessels, that they could only
afford room for his knights and nobles; and the plebeian crowd of
infantry was left to perish at the foot of the Pamphylian hills. The
emperor and the king embraced and wept at Jerusalem; their martial
trains, the remnant of mighty armies, were joined to the Christian
powers of Syria, and a fruitless siege of Damascus was the final effort
of the second crusade. Conrad and Louis embarked for Europe with the
personal fame of piety and courage; but the Orientals had braved these
potent monarchs of the Franks, with whose names and military forces they
had been so often threatened. ^22 Perhaps they had still more to fear
from the veteran genius of Frederic the First, who in his youth had
served in Asia under his uncle Conrad. Forty campaigns in Germany and
Italy had taught Barbarossa to command; and his soldiers, even the
princes of the empire, were accustomed under his reign to obey. As soon
as he lost sight of Philadelphia and Laodicea, the last cities of the
Greek frontier, he plunged into the salt and barren desert, a land (says
the historian) of horror and tribulation. ^23 During twenty days, every
step of his fainting and sickly march was besieged by the innumerable
hordes of Turkmans, ^24 whose numbers and fury seemed after each defeat
to multiply and inflame. The emperor continued to struggle and to
suffer; and such was the measure of his calamities, that when he reached
the gates of Iconium, no more than one thousand knights were able to
serve on horseback. By a sudden and resolute assault he defeated the
guards, and stormed the capital of the sultan, ^25 who humbly sued for
pardon and peace. The road was now open, and Frederic advanced in a
career of triumph, till he was unfortunately drowned in a petty torrent
of Cilicia. ^26 The remainder of his Germans was consumed by sickness
and desertion: and the emperor’s son expired with the greatest part of
his Swabian vassals at the siege of Acre. Among the Latin heroes,
Godfrey of Bouillon and Frederic Barbarossa could alone achieve the
passage of the Lesser Asia; yet even their success was a warning; and in
the last and most experienced age of the crusades, every nation
preferred the sea to the toils and perils of an inland expedition.

of the first crusade, (Secreta Fidelium Crucis, l. ii. pars ii. c. i.
p. 37.)]</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the first crusade is a natural and simple event,
while hope was fresh, danger untried, and enterprise congenial to the
spirit of the times. But the obstinate perseverance of Europe may indeed
excite our pity and admiration; that no instruction should have been
drawn from constant and adverse experience; that the same confidence
should have repeatedly grown from the same failures; that six succeeding
generations should have rushed headlong down the precipice that was open
before them; and that men of every condition should have staked their
public and private fortunes on the desperate adventure of possessing or
recovering a tombstone two thousand miles from their country. In a
period of two centuries after the council of Clermont, each spring and
summer produced a new emigration of pilgrim warriors for the defence of
the Holy Land; but the seven great armaments or crusades were excited by
some impending or recent calamity: the nations were moved by the
authority of their pontiffs, and the example of their kings: their zeal
was kindled, and their reason was silenced, by the voice of their holy
orators; and among these, Bernard, ^28 the monk, or the saint, may claim
the most honorable place. ^* About eight years before the first conquest
of Jerusalem, he was born of a noble family in Burgundy; at the age of
three- and-twenty he buried himself in the monastery of Citeaux, then in
the primitive fervor of the institution; at the end of two years he led
forth her third colony, or daughter, to the valley of Clairvaux ^29 in
Champagne; and was content, till the hour of his death, with the humble
station of abbot of his own community. A philosophic age has abolished,
with too liberal and indiscriminate disdain, the honors of these
spiritual heroes. The meanest among them are distinguished by some
energies of the mind; they were at least superior to their votaries and
disciples; and, in the race of superstition, they attained the prize for
which such numbers contended. In speech, in writing, in action, Bernard
stood high above his rivals and contemporaries; his compositions are not
devoid of wit and eloquence; and he seems to have preserved as much
reason and humanity as may be reconciled with the character of a saint.
In a secular life, he would have shared the seventh part of a private
inheritance; by a vow of poverty and penance, by closing his eyes
against the visible world, ^30 by the refusal of all ecclesiastical
dignities, the abbot of Clairvaux became the oracle of Europe, and the
founder of one hundred and sixty convents. Princes and pontiffs trembled
at the freedom of his apostolical censures: France, England, and Milan,
consulted and obeyed his judgment in a schism of the church: the debt
was repaid by the gratitude of Innocent the Second; and his successor,
Eugenius the Third, was the friend and disciple of the holy Bernard. It
was in the proclamation of the second crusade that he shone as the
missionary and prophet of God, who called the nations to the defence of
his holy sepulchre. ^31 At the parliament of Vezelay he spoke before the
king; and Louis the Seventh, with his nobles, received their crosses
from his hand. The abbot of Clairvaux then marched to the less easy
conquest of the emperor Conrad: ^* a phlegmatic people, ignorant of his
language, was transported by the pathetic vehemence of his tone and
gestures; and his progress, from Constance to Cologne, was the triumph
of eloquence and zeal. Bernard applauds his own success in the
depopulation of Europe; affirms that cities and castles were emptied of
their inhabitants; and computes, that only one man was left behind for
the consolation of seven widows. ^32 The blind fanatics were desirous of
electing him for their general; but the example of the hermit Peter was
before his eyes; and while he assured the crusaders of the divine favor,
he prudently declined a military command, in which failure and victory
would have been almost equally disgraceful to his character. ^33 Yet,
after the calamitous event, the abbot of Clairvaux was loudly accused as
a false prophet, the author of the public and private mourning; his
enemies exulted, his friends blushed, and his apology was slow and
unsatisfactory. He justifies his obedience to the commands of the pope;
expatiates on the mysterious ways of Providence; imputes the misfortunes
of the pilgrims to their own sins; and modestly insinuates, that his
mission had been approved by signs and wonders. ^34 Had the fact been
certain, the argument would be decisive; and his faithful disciples, who
enumerate twenty or thirty miracles in a day, appeal to the public
assemblies of France and Germany, in which they were performed. ^35 At
the present hour, such prodigies will not obtain credit beyond the
precincts of Clairvaux; but in the preternatural cures of the blind, the
lame, and the sick, who were presented to the man of God, it is
impossible for us to ascertain the separate shares of accident, of
fancy, of imposture, and of fiction.</p>
<p>[Footnote 28: The most authentic information of St. Bernard must be
drawn from his own writings, published in a correct edition by Pere
Mabillon, and reprinted at Venice, 1750, in six volumes in folio.

contained in the two lives, by his disciples, in the vith volume:

least accurate and satisfactory chapter in his History, has here failed

great perplexity of the reader, placed the preaching of St Bernard after
the second crusade to which i led. - M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 29: Clairvaux, surnamed the valley of Absynth, is situate
among the woods near Bar sur Aube in Champagne. St. Bernard would blush
at the pomp of the church and monastery; he would ask for the library,
and I know not whether he would be much edified by a tun of 800 muids,
(914 1-7 hogsheads,) which almost rivals that of Heidelberg, (Melanges

of his pious apathy. Juxta lacum etiam Lausannensem totius diei itinere

<p>Omnipotence itself cannot escape the murmurs of its discordant
votaries; since the same dispensation which was applauded as a
deliverance in Europe, was deplored, and perhaps arraigned, as a
calamity in Asia. After the loss of Jerusalem, the Syrian fugitives
diffused their consternation and sorrow; Bagdad mourned in the dust; the
cadhi Zeineddin of Damascus tore his beard in the caliph’s presence; and
the whole divan shed tears at his melancholy tale. ^36 But the
commanders of the faithful could only weep; they were themselves
captives in the hands of the Turks: some temporal power was restored to
the last age of the Abbassides; but their humble ambition was confined
to Bagdad and the adjacent province. Their tyrants, the Seljukian
sultans, had followed the common law of the Asiatic dynasties, the
unceasing round of valor, greatness, discord, degeneracy, and decay;
their spirit and power were unequal to the defence of religion; and, in
his distant realm of Persia, the Christians were strangers to the name
and the arms of Sangiar, the last hero of his race. ^37 While the
sultans were involved in the silken web of the harem, the pious task was
undertaken by their slaves, the Atabeks, ^38 a Turkish name, which, like
the Byzantine patricians, may be translated by Father of the Prince.
Ascansar, a valiant Turk, had been the favorite of Malek Shaw, from whom
he received the privilege of standing on the right hand of the throne;
but, in the civil wars that ensued on the monarch’s death, he lost his
head and the government of Aleppo. His domestic emirs persevered in
their attachment to his son Zenghi, who proved his first arms against
the Franks in the defeat of Antioch: thirty campaigns in the service of
the caliph and sultan established his military fame; and he was invested
with the command of Mosul, as the only champion that could avenge the
cause of the prophet. The public hope was not disappointed: after a
siege of twenty-five days, he stormed the city of Edessa, and recovered
from the Franks their conquests beyond the Euphrates: ^39 the martial
tribes of Curdistan were subdued by the independent sovereign of Mosul
and Aleppo: his soldiers were taught to behold the camp as their only
country; they trusted to his liberality for their rewards; and their
absent families were protected by the vigilance of Zenghi. At the head
of these veterans, his son Noureddin gradually united the Mahometan
powers; ^* added the kingdom of Damascus to that of Aleppo, and waged a
long and successful war against the Christians of Syria; he spread his
ample reign from the Tigris to the Nile, and the Abbassides rewarded
their faithful servant with all the titles and prerogatives of royalty.
The Latins themselves were compelled to own the wisdom and courage, and
even the justice and piety, of this implacable adversary. ^40 In his
life and government the holy warrior revived the zeal and simplicity of
the first caliphs. Gold and silk were banished from his palace; the use
of wine from his dominions; the public revenue was scrupulously applied
to the public service; and the frugal household of Noureddin was
maintained from his legitimate share of the spoil which he vested in the
purchase of a private estate.</p>
<p>His favorite sultana sighed for some female object of expense.
“Alas,“ replied the king, “I fear God, and am no more than the treasurer
of the Moslems. Their property I cannot alienate; but I still possess
three shops in the city of Hems: these you may take; and these alone can
I bestow.“ His chamber of justice was the terror of the great and the
refuge of the poor. Some years after the sultan’s death, an oppressed
subject called aloud in the streets of Damascus, “O Noureddin,
Noureddin, where art thou now? Arise, arise, to pity and protect us!“ A
tumult was apprehended, and a living tyrant blushed or trembled at the
name of a departed monarch.</p>

love of his subjects, that they prayed for the sultan a year after his
decease. Yet Sangiar might have been made prisoner by the Franks, as
well as by the Uzes. He reigned near fifty years, (A.D. 1103 - 1152,)
