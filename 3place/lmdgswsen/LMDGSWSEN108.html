XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The Empire.</h4>
<p>Part VII.</p>
<p>The mind of Valentinian, who then resided at Treves, was deeply
affected by the calamities of Illyricum; but the lateness of the season
suspended the execution of his designs till the ensuing spring. He
marched in person, with a considerable part of the forces of Gaul, from
the banks of the Moselle: and to the suppliant ambassadors of the
Sarmatians, who met him on the way, he returned a doubtful answer, that,
as soon as he reached the scene of action, he should examine, and
pronounce. When he arrived at Sirmium, he gave audience to the deputies
of the Illyrian provinces; who loudly congratulated their own felicity
under the auspicious government of Probus, his Praetorian praefect. ^151
Valentinian, who was flattered by these demonstrations of their loyalty
and gratitude, imprudently asked the deputy of Epirus, a Cynic
philosopher of intrepid sincerity, ^152 whether he was freely sent by
the wishes of the province. “With tears and groans am I sent,“ replied
Iphicles, “by a reluctant people.“ The emperor paused: but the impunity
of his ministers established the pernicious maxim, that they might
oppress his subjects, without injuring his service. A strict inquiry
into their conduct would have relieved the public discontent. The severe
condemnation of the murder of Gabinius, was the only measure which could
restore the confidence of the Germans, and vindicate the honor of the
Roman name. But the haughty monarch was incapable of the magnanimity
which dares to acknowledge a fault. He forgot the provocation,
remembered only the injury, and advanced into the country of the Quadi
with an insatiate thirst of blood and revenge. The extreme devastation,
and promiscuous massacre, of a savage war, were justified, in the eyes
of the emperor, and perhaps in those of the world, by the cruel equity
of retaliation: ^153 and such was the discipline of the Romans, and the
consternation of the enemy, that Valentinian repassed the Danube without
the loss of a single man. As he had resolved to complete the destruction
of the Quadi by a second campaign, he fixed his winter quarters at
Bregetio, on the Danube, near the Hungarian city of Presburg. While the
operations of war were suspended by the severity of the weather, the
Quadi made an humble attempt to deprecate the wrath of their conqueror;
and, at the earnest persuasion of Equitius, their ambassadors were
introduced into the Imperial council. They approached the throne with
bended bodies and dejected countenances; and without daring to complain
of the murder of their king, they affirmed, with solemn oaths, that the
late invasion was the crime of some irregular robbers, which the public
council of the nation condemned and abhorred. The answer of the emperor
left them but little to hope from his clemency or compassion. He
reviled, in the most intemperate language, their baseness, their
ingratitude, their insolence. His eyes, his voice, his color, his
gestures, expressed the violence of his ungoverned fury; and while his
whole frame was agitated with convulsive passion, a large blood vessel
suddenly burst in his body; and Valentinian fell speechless into the
arms of his attendants. Their pious care immediately concealed his
situation from the crowd; but, in a few minutes, the emperor of the West
expired in an agony of pain, retaining his senses till the last; and
struggling, without success, to declare his intentions to the generals
and ministers, who surrounded the royal couch. Valentinian was about
fifty-four years of age; and he wanted only one hundred days to
accomplish the twelve years of his reign. ^154</p>
<p>[Footnote 151: Ammianus, (xxx. 5,) who acknowledges the merit, has
censured, with becoming asperity, the oppressive administration of
Petronius Probus. When Jerom translated and continued the Chronicle of
Eusebius, (A. D. 380; see Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xii. p. 53, 626,)
he expressed the truth, or at least the public opinion of his country,
in the following words: “Probus P. P. Illyrici inquissimus tributorum
exactionibus, ante provincias quas regebat, quam a Barbaris vastarentur,
erasit.“ (Chron. edit. Scaliger, p. 187. Animadvers p. 259.) The Saint
afterwards formed an intimate and tender friendship with the widow of
Probus; and the name of Count Equitius with less propriety, but without
much injustice, has been substituted in the text.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 152: Julian (Orat. vi. p. 198) represents his friend
Iphicles, as a man of virtue and merit, who had made himself ridiculous
and unhappy by adopting the extravagant dress and manners of the
Cynics.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 153: Ammian. xxx. v. Jerom, who exaggerates the misfortune
of Valentinian, refuses him even this last consolation of revenge.
Genitali vastato solo et inultam patriam derelinquens, (tom. i.
p. 26.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 154: See, on the death of Valentinian, Ammianus, (xxx. 6,)
Zosimus, (l. iv. p. 221,) Victor, (in Epitom.,) Socrates, (l. iv.
c. 31,) and Jerom, (in Chron. p. 187, and tom. i. p. 26, ad Heliodor.)
There is much variety of circumstances among them; and Ammianus is so
eloquent, that he writes nonsense.]</p>
<p>The polygamy of Valentinian is seriously attested by an
ecclesiastical historian. ^155 “The empress Severa (I relate the fable)
admitted into her familiar society the lovely Justina, the daughter of
an Italian governor: her admiration of those naked charms, which she had
often seen in the bath, was expressed with such lavish and imprudent
praise, that the emperor was tempted to introduce a second wife into his
bed; and his public edict extended to all the subjects of the empire the
same domestic privilege which he had assumed for himself.“ But we may be
assured, from the evidence of reason as well as history, that the two
marriages of Valentinian, with Severa, and with Justina, were
successively contracted; and that he used the ancient permission of
divorce, which was still allowed by the laws, though it was condemned by
the church Severa was the mother of Gratian, who seemed to unite every
claim which could entitle him to the undoubted succession of the Western
empire. He was the eldest son of a monarch whose glorious reign had
confirmed the free and honorable choice of his fellow- soldiers. Before
he had attained the ninth year of his age, the royal youth received from
the hands of his indulgent father the purple robe and diadem, with the
title of Augustus; the election was solemnly ratified by the consent and
applause of the armies of Gaul; ^156 and the name of Gratian was added
to the names of Valentinian and Valens, in all the legal transactions of
the Roman government. By his marriage with the granddaughter of
Constantine, the son of Valentinian acquired all the hereditary rights
of the Flavian family; which, in a series of three Imperial generations,
were sanctified by time, religion, and the reverence of the people. At
the death of his father, the royal youth was in the seventeenth year of
his age; and his virtues already justified the favorable opinion of the
army and the people. But Gratian resided, without apprehension, in the
palace of Treves; whilst, at the distance of many hundred miles,
Valentinian suddenly expired in the camp of Bregetio. The passions,
which had been so long suppressed by the presence of a master,
immediately revived in the Imperial council; and the ambitious design of
reigning in the name of an infant, was artfully executed by Mellobaudes
and Equitius, who commanded the attachment of the Illyrian and Italian
bands. They contrived the most honorable pretences to remove the popular
leaders, and the troops of Gaul, who might have asserted the claims of
the lawful successor; they suggested the necessity of extinguishing the
hopes of foreign and domestic enemies, by a bold and decisive measure.
The empress Justina, who had been left in a palace about one hundred
miles from Bregetio, was respectively invited to appear in the camp,
with the son of the deceased emperor. On the sixth day after the death
of Valentinian, the infant prince of the same name, who was only four
years old, was shown, in the arms of his mother, to the legions; and
solemnly invested, by military acclamation, with the titles and ensigns
of supreme power. The impending dangers of a civil war were seasonably
prevented by the wise and moderate conduct of the emperor Gratian. He
cheerfully accepted the choice of the army; declared that he should
always consider the son of Justina as a brother, not as a rival; and
advised the empress, with her son Valentinian to fix their residence at
Milan, in the fair and peaceful province of Italy; while he assumed the
more arduous command of the countries beyond the Alps. Gratian
dissembled his resentment till he could safely punish, or disgrace, the
authors of the conspiracy; and though he uniformly behaved with
tenderness and regard to his infant colleague, he gradually confounded,
in the administration of the Western empire, the office of a guardian
with the authority of a sovereign. The government of the Roman world was
exercised in the united names of Valens and his two nephews; but the
feeble emperor of the East, who succeeded to the rank of his elder
brother, never obtained any weight or influence in the councils of the
West. ^157</p>
<p>[Footnote 155: Socrates (l. iv. c. 31) is the only original witness
of this foolish story, so repugnant to the laws and manners of the
Romans, that it scarcely deserved the formal and elaborate dissertation
of M. Bonamy, (Mem. de l’Academie, tom. xxx. p. 394-405.) Yet I would
preserve the natural circumstance of the bath; instead of following
Zosimus who represents Justina as an old woman, the widow of
Magnentius.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 156: Ammianus (xxvii. 6) describes the form of this
military election, and august investiture. Valentinian does not appear
to have consulted, or even informed, the senate of Rome.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 157: Ammianus, xxx. 10. Zosimus, l. iv. p. 222, 223.
Tillemont has proved (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 707-709) that
Gratian reignea in Italy, Africa, and Illyricum. I have endeavored to
express his authority over his brother’s dominions, as he used it, in an
ambiguous style.]</p>
