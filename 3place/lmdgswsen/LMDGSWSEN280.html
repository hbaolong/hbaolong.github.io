LXVI : Union Of The Greek And Latin Churches.</h4>
<p>Part I.</p>
<p>Applications Of The Eastern Emperors To The Popes. - Visits To The
West, Of John The First, Manuel, And John The Second, Palaeologus. -
Union Of The Greek And Latin Churches, Promoted By The Council Of Basil,
And Concluded At Ferrara And Florence. - State Of Literature At
Constantinople. - Its Revival In Italy By The Greek Fugitives. -
Curiosity And Emulation Of The Latins.</p>
<p>In the four last centuries of the Greek emperors, their friendly or
hostile aspect towards the pope and the Latins may be observed as the
thermometer of their prosperity or distress; as the scale of the rise
and fall of the Barbarian dynasties. When the Turks of the house of
Seljuk pervaded Asia, and threatened Constantinople, we have seen, at
the council of Placentia, the suppliant ambassadors of Alexius imploring
the protection of the common father of the Christians. No sooner had the
arms of the French pilgrims removed the sultan from Nice to Iconium,
than the Greek princes resumed, or avowed, their genuine hatred and
contempt for the schismatics of the West, which precipitated the first
downfall of their empire. The date of the Mogul invasion is marked in
the soft and charitable language of John Vataces. After the recovery of
Constantinople, the throne of the first Palaeologus was encompassed by
foreign and domestic enemies; as long as the sword of Charles was
suspended over his head, he basely courted the favor of the Roman
pontiff; and sacrificed to the present danger his faith, his virtue, and
the affection of his subjects. On the decease of Michael, the prince and
people asserted the independence of their church, and the purity of
their creed: the elder Andronicus neither feared nor loved the Latins;
in his last distress, pride was the safeguard of superstition; nor could
he decently retract in his age the firm and orthodox declarations of his
youth. His grandson, the younger Andronicus, was less a slave in his
temper and situation; and the conquest of Bithynia by the Turks
admonished him to seek a temporal and spiritual alliance with the
Western princes. After a separation and silence of fifty years, a secret
agent, the monk Barlaam, was despatched to Pope Benedict the Twelfth;
and his artful instructions appear to have been drawn by the master-hand
of the great domestic. ^1 “Most holy father,“ was he commissioned to
say, “the emperor is not less desirous than yourself of a union between
the two churches: but in this delicate transaction, he is obliged to
respect his own dignity and the prejudices of his subjects. The ways of
union are twofold; force and persuasion. Of force, the inefficacy has
been already tried; since the Latins have subdued the empire, without
subduing the minds, of the Greeks. The method of persuasion, though
slow, is sure and permanent. A deputation of thirty or forty of our
doctors would probably agree with those of the Vatican, in the love of
truth and the unity of belief; but on their return, what would be the
use, the recompense, of such an agreement? the scorn of their brethren,
and the reproaches of a blind and obstinate nation. Yet that nation is
accustomed to reverence the general councils, which have fixed the
articles of our faith; and if they reprobate the decrees of Lyons, it is
because the Eastern churches were neither heard nor represented in that
arbitrary meeting. For this salutary end, it will be expedient, and even
necessary, that a well-chosen legate should be sent into Greece, to
convene the patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and
Jerusalem; and, with their aid, to prepare a free and universal synod.
But at this moment,“ continued the subtle agent, “the empire is
assaulted and endangered by the Turks, who have occupied four of the
greatest cities of Anatolia. The Christian inhabitants have expressed a
wish of returning to their allegiance and religion; but the forces and
revenues of the emperor are insufficient for their deliverance: and the
Roman legate must be accompanied, or preceded, by an army of Franks, to
expel the infidels, and open a way to the holy sepulchre.“ If the
suspicious Latins should require some pledge, some previous effect of
the sincerity of the Greeks, the answers of Barlaam were perspicuous and
rational. “1. A general synod can alone consummate the union of the
churches; nor can such a synod be held till the three Oriental
patriarchs, and a great number of bishops, are enfranchised from the
Mahometan yoke. 2. The Greeks are alienated by a long series of
oppression and injury: they must be reconciled by some act of brotherly
love, some effectual succor, which may fortify the authority and
arguments of the emperor, and the friends of the union. 3. If some
difference of faith or ceremonies should be found incurable, the Greeks,
however, are the disciples of Christ; and the Turks are the common
enemies of the Christian name. The Armenians, Cyprians, and Rhodians,
are equally attacked; and it will become the piety of the French princes
to draw their swords in the general defence of religion. 4. Should the
subjects of Andronicus be treated as the worst of schismatics, of
heretics, of pagans, a judicious policy may yet instruct the powers of
the West to embrace a useful ally, to uphold a sinking empire, to guard
the confines of Europe; and rather to join the Greeks against the Turks,
than to expect the union of the Turkish arms with the troops and
treasures of captive Greece.“ The reasons, the offers, and the demands,
of Andronicus were eluded with cold and stately indifference. The kings
of France and Naples declined the dangers and glory of a crusade; the
pope refused to call a new synod to determine old articles of faith; and
his regard for the obsolete claims of the Latin emperor and clergy
engaged him to use an offensive superscription, - “To the moderator ^2
of the Greeks, and the persons who style themselves the patriarchs of
the Eastern churches.“ For such an embassy, a time and character less
propitious could not easily have been found. Benedict the Twelfth ^3 was
a dull peasant, perplexed with scruples, and immersed in sloth and wine:
his pride might enrich with a third crown the papal tiara, but he was
alike unfit for the regal and the pastoral office.</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: This curious instruction was transcribed (I believe)
from the Vatican archives, by Odoricus Raynaldus, in his Continuation of
the Annals of Baronius, (Romae, 1646 - 1677, in x. volumes in folio.) I
have contented myself with the Abbe Fleury, (Hist. Ecclesiastique. tom.
xx. p. 1 - 8,) whose abstracts I have always found to be clear,
accurate, and impartial.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: The ambiguity of this title is happy or ingenious; and
moderator, as synonymous to rector, gubernator, is a word of classical,
and even Ciceronian, Latinity, which may be found, not in the Glossary
of Ducange, but in the Thesaurus of Robert Stephens.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: The first epistle (sine titulo) of Petrarch exposes the
danger of the bark, and the incapacity of the pilot. Haec inter, vino
madidus, aeve gravis, ac soporifero rore perfusus, jamjam nutitat,
dormitat, jam somno praeceps, atque (utinam solus) ruit . . . . . Heu
quanto felicius patrio terram sulcasset aratro, quam scalmum piscatorium
ascendisset! This satire engages his biographer to weigh the virtues and
vices of Benedict XII. which have been exaggerated by Guelphs and Ghibe
lines, by Papists and Protestants, (see Memoires sur la Vie de
Petrarque, tom. i. p. 259, ii. not. xv. p. 13 - 16.) He gave occasion to
the saying, Bibamus papaliter.]</p>
<p>After the decease of Andronicus, while the Greeks were distracted by
intestine war, they could not presume to agitate a general union of the
Christians. But as soon as Cantacuzene had subdued and pardoned his
enemies, he was anxious to justify, or at least to extenuate, the
introduction of the Turks into Europe, and the nuptials of his daughter
with a Mussulman prince. Two officers of state, with a Latin
interpreter, were sent in his name to the Roman court, which was
transplanted to Avignon, on the banks of the Rhone, during a period of
seventy years: they represented the hard necessity which had urged him
to embrace the alliance of the miscreants, and pronounced by his command
the specious and edifying sounds of union and crusade. Pope Clement the
Sixth, ^4 the successor of Benedict, received them with hospitality and
honor, acknowledged the innocence of their sovereign, excused his
distress, applauded his magnanimity, and displayed a clear knowledge of
the state and revolutions of the Greek empire, which he had imbibed from
the honest accounts of a Savoyard lady, an attendant of the empress
Anne. ^5 If Clement was ill endowed with the virtues of a priest, he
possessed, however, the spirit and magnificence of a prince, whose
liberal hand distributed benefices and kingdoms with equal facility.
Under his reign Avignon was the seat of pomp and pleasure: in his youth
he had surpassed the licentiousness of a baron; and the palace, nay, the
bed-chamber of the pope, was adorned, or polluted, by the visits of his
female favorites. The wars of France and England were adverse to the
holy enterprise; but his vanity was amused by the splendid idea; and the
Greek ambassadors returned with two Latin bishops, the ministers of the
pontiff. On their arrival at Constantinople, the emperor and the nuncios
admired each other’s piety and eloquence; and their frequent conferences
were filled with mutual praises and promises, by which both parties were
amused, and neither could be deceived. “I am delighted,“ said the devout
Cantacuzene, “with the project of our holy war, which must redound to my
personal glory, as well as to the public benefit of Christendom. My
dominions will give a free passage to the armies of France: my troops,
my galleys, my treasures, shall be consecrated to the common cause; and
happy would be my fate, could I deserve and obtain the crown of
martyrdom. Words are insufficient to express the ardor with which I sigh
for the reunion of the scattered members of Christ. If my death could
avail, I would gladly present my sword and my neck: if the spiritual
phoenix could arise from my ashes, I would erect the pile, and kindle
the flame with my own hands.“ Yet the Greek emperor presumed to observe,
that the articles of faith which divided the two churches had been
introduced by the pride and precipitation of the Latins: he disclaimed
the servile and arbitrary steps of the first Palaeologus; and firmly
declared, that he would never submit his conscience unless to the
decrees of a free and universal synod. “The situation of the times,“
continued he, “will not allow the pope and myself to meet either at Rome
or Constantinople; but some maritime city may be chosen on the verge of
the two empires, to unite the bishops, and to instruct the faithful, of
the East and West.“ The nuncios seemed content with the proposition; and
Cantacuzene affects to deplore the failure of his hopes, which were soon
overthrown by the death of Clement, and the different temper of his
successor. His own life was prolonged, but it was prolonged in a
cloister; and, except by his prayers, the humble monk was incapable of
directing the counsels of his pupil or the state. ^6</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: See the original Lives of Clement VI. in Muratori,
(Script. Rerum Italicarum, tom. iii. P. ii. p. 550 - 589;) Matteo
Villani, (Chron. l. iii. c. 43, in Muratori, tom. xiv. p. 186,) who
styles him, molto cavallaresco, poco religioso; Fleury, (Hist. Eccles.
tom. xx. p. 126;) and the Vie de Petrarque, (tom. ii. p. 42 - 45.) The
abbe de Sade treats him with the most indulgence; but he is a gentleman
as well as a priest.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: Her name (most probably corrupted) was Zampea. She had
accompanied, and alone remained with her mistress at Constantinople,
where her prudence, erudition, and politeness deserved the praises of
the Greeks themselves, (Cantacuzen. l. i. c. 42.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: See this whole negotiation in Cantacuzene, (l. iv.
c. 9,) who, amidst the praises and virtues which he bestows on himself,
reveals the uneasiness of a guilty conscience.]</p>
<p>Yet of all the Byzantine princes, that pupil, John Palaeologus, was
the best disposed to embrace, to believe, and to obey, the shepherd of
the West. His mother, Anne of Savoy, was baptized in the bosom of the
Latin church: her marriage with Andronicus imposed a change of name, of
apparel, and of worship, but her heart was still faithful to her country
and religion: she had formed the infancy of her son, and she governed
the emperor, after his mind, or at least his stature, was enlarged to
the size of man. In the first year of his deliverance and restoration,
the Turks were still masters of the Hellespont; the son of Cantacuzene
was in arms at Adrianople; and Palaeologus could depend neither on
himself nor on his people. By his mother’s advice, and in the hope of
foreign aid, he abjured the rights both of the church and state; and the
act of slavery, ^7 subscribed in purple ink, and sealed with the golden
bull, was privately intrusted to an Italian agent. The first article of
the treaty is an oath of fidelity and obedience to Innocent the Sixth
and his successors, the supreme pontiffs of the Roman and Catholic
church. The emperor promises to entertain with due reverence their
legates and nuncios; to assign a palace for their residence, and a
temple for their worship; and to deliver his second son Manuel as the
hostage of his faith. For these condescensions he requires a prompt
succor of fifteen galleys, with five hundred men at arms, and a thousand
archers, to serve against his Christian and Mussulman enemies.
Palaeologus engages to impose on his clergy and people the same
spiritual yoke; but as the resistance of the Greeks might be justly
foreseen, he adopts the two effectual methods of corruption and
education. The legate was empowered to distribute the vacant benefices
among the ecclesiastics who should subscribe the creed of the Vatican:
three schools were instituted to instruct the youth of Constantinople in
the language and doctrine of the Latins; and the name of Andronicus, the
heir of the empire, was enrolled as the first student. Should he fail in
the measures of persuasion or force, Palaeologus declares himself
unworthy to reign; transferred to the pope all regal and paternal
authority; and invests Innocent with full power to regulate the family,
the government, and the marriage, of his son and successor. But this
treaty was neither executed nor published: the Roman galleys were as
vain and imaginary as the submission of the Greeks; and it was only by
the secrecy that their sovereign escaped the dishonor of this fruitless
humiliation.</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: See this ignominious treaty in Fleury, (Hist. Eccles.
p. 151 - 154,) from Raynaldus, who drew it from the Vatican archives. It
was not worth the trouble of a pious forgery.]</p>
<p>The tempest of the Turkish arms soon burst on his head; and after the
loss of Adrianople and Romania, he was enclosed in his capital, the
vassal of the haughty Amurath, with the miserable hope of being the last
devoured by the savage. In this abject state, Palaeologus embraced the
resolution of embarking for Venice, and casting himself at the feet of
the pope: he was the first of the Byzantine princes who had ever visited
the unknown regions of the West, yet in them alone he could seek
consolation or relief; and with less violation of his dignity he might
appear in the sacred college than at the Ottoman Porte. After a long
absence, the Roman pontiffs were returning from Avignon to the banks of
the Tyber: Urban the Fifth, ^8 of a mild and virtuous character,
encouraged or allowed the pilgrimage of the Greek prince; and, within
the same year, enjoyed the glory of receiving in the Vatican the two
Imperial shadows who represented the majesty of Constantine and
Charlemagne. In this suppliant visit, the emperor of Constantinople,
whose vanity was lost in his distress, gave more than could be expected
of empty sounds and formal submissions. A previous trial was imposed;
and, in the presence of four cardinals, he acknowledged, as a true
Catholic, the supremacy of the pope, and the double procession of the
Holy Ghost. After this purification, he was introduced to a public
audience in the church of St. Peter: Urban, in the midst of the
cardinals, was seated on his throne; the Greek monarch, after three
genuflections, devoutly kissed the feet, the hands, and at length the
mouth, of the holy father, who celebrated high mass in his presence,
allowed him to lead the bridle of his mule, and treated him with a
sumptuous banquet in the Vatican. The entertainment of Palaeologus was
friendly and honorable; yet some difference was observed between the
emperors of the East and West; ^9 nor could the former be entitled to
the rare privilege of chanting the gospel in the rank of a deacon. ^10
In favor of his proselyte, Urban strove to rekindle the zeal of the
French king and the other powers of the West; but he found them cold in
the general cause, and active only in their domestic quarrels. The last
hope of the emperor was in an English mercenary, John Hawkwood, ^11 or
Acuto, who, with a band of adventurers, the white brotherhood, had
ravaged Italy from the Alps to Calabria; sold his services to the
hostile states; and incurred a just excommunication by shooting his
arrows against the papal residence. A special license was granted to
negotiate with the outlaw, but the forces, or the spirit, of Hawkwood,
were unequal to the enterprise: and it was for the advantage, perhaps,
of Palaeologus to be disappointed of succor, that must have been costly,
that could not be effectual, and which might have been dangerous. ^12
The disconsolate Greek ^13 prepared for his return, but even his return
was impeded by a most ignominious obstacle. On his arrival at Venice, he
had borrowed large sums at exorbitant usury; but his coffers were empty,
his creditors were impatient, and his person was detained as the best
security for the payment. His eldest son, Andronicus, the regent of
Constantinople, was repeatedly urged to exhaust every resource; and even
by stripping the churches, to extricate his father from captivity and
disgrace. But the unnatural youth was insensible of the disgrace, and
secretly pleased with the captivity of the emperor: the state was poor,
the clergy were obstinate; nor could some religious scruple be wanting
to excuse the guilt of his indifference and delay. Such undutiful
neglect was severely reproved by the piety of his brother Manuel, who
instantly sold or mortgaged all that he possessed, embarked for Venice,
relieved his father, and pledged his own freedom to be responsible for
the debt. On his return to Constantinople, the parent and king
distinguished his two sons with suitable rewards; but the faith and
manners of the slothful Palaeologus had not been improved by his Roman
pilgrimage; and his apostasy or conversion, devoid of any spiritual or
temporal effects, was speedily forgotten by the Greeks and Latins.

<p>[Footnote 8: See the two first original Lives of Urban V., (in
Muratori, Script. Rerum Italicarum, tom. iii. P. ii. p. 623, 635,) and
the Ecclesiastical Annals of Spondanus, (tom. i. p. 573, A.D. 1369,
No. 7,) and Raynaldus, (Fleury, Hist. Eccles. tom. xx. p. 223, 224.)
Yet, from some variations, I suspect the papal writers of slightly
magnifying the genuflections of Palaeologus.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: Paullo minus quam si fuisset Imperator Romanorum. Yet
his title of Imperator Graecorum was no longer disputed, (Vit. Urban V.
p. 623.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: It was confined to the successors of Charlemagne, and
to them only on Christmas-day. On all other festivals these Imperial
deacons were content to serve the pope, as he said mass, with the book
and the corporale. Yet the abbe de Sade generously thinks that the
merits of Charles IV. might have entitled him, though not on the proper
day, (A.D. 1368, November 1,) to the whole privilege. He seems to affix
a just value on the privilege and the man, (Vie de Petrarque, tom. iii.
p. 735.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 11: Through some Italian corruptions, the etymology of
Falcone in bosco, (Matteo Villani, l. xi. c. 79, in Muratori, tom. xv.
p. 746,) suggests the English word Hawkwood, the true name of our
adventurous countryman, (Thomas Walsingham, Hist. Anglican. inter
Scriptores Cambdeni, p. 184.) After two-and-twenty victories, and one
defeat, he died, in 1394, general of the Florentines, and was buried
with such honors as the republic has not paid to Dante or Petrarch,
(Muratori, Annali d’Italia, tom. xii. p. 212 - 371.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 12: This torrent of English (by birth or service)
overflowed from France into Italy after the peace of Bretigny in 1630.
Yet the exclamation of Muratori (Annali, tom. xii. p. 197) is rather
true than civil. “Ci mancava ancor questo, che dopo essere calpestrata
l’Italia da tanti masnadieri Tedeschi ed Ungheri, venissero fin dall’
Inghliterra nuovi cani a finire di divorarla.“]</p>
<p>[Footnote 13: Chalcondyles, l. i. p. 25, 26. The Greek supposes his
journey to the king of France, which is sufficiently refuted by the
silence of the national historians. Nor am I much more inclined to
believe, that Palaeologus departed from Italy, valde bene consolatus et
contentus, (Vit. Urban V. p. 623.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 14: His return in 1370, and the coronation of Manuel,
Sept. 25, 1373, (Ducange, Fam. Byzant. p. 241,) leaves some intermediate
aera for the conspiracy and punishment of Andronicus.]</p>
<p>Thirty years after the return of Palaeologus, his son and successor,
Manuel, from a similar motive, but on a larger scale, again visited the
countries of the West. In a preceding chapter I have related his treaty
with Bajazet, the violation of that treaty, the siege or blockade of
Constantinople, and the French succor under the command of the gallant
Boucicault. ^15 By his ambassadors, Manuel had solicited the Latin
powers; but it was thought that the presence of a distressed monarch
would draw tears and supplies from the hardest Barbarians; ^16 and the
marshal who advised the journey prepared the reception of the Byzantine
prince. The land was occupied by the Turks; but the navigation of Venice
was safe and open: Italy received him as the first, or, at least, as the
second, of the Christian princes; Manuel was pitied as the champion and
confessor of the faith; and the dignity of his behavior prevented that
pity from sinking into contempt. From Venice he proceeded to Padua and
Pavia; and even the duke of Milan, a secret ally of Bajazet, gave him
safe and honorable conduct to the verge of his dominions. ^17 On the
confines of France ^18 the royal officers undertook the care of his
person, journey, and expenses; and two thousand of the richest citizens,
in arms and on horseback, came forth to meet him as far as Charenton, in
the neighborhood of the capital. At the gates of Paris, he was saluted
by the chancellor and the parliament; and Charles the Sixth, attended by
his princes and nobles, welcomed his brother with a cordial embrace. The
successor of Constantine was clothed in a robe of white silk, and
mounted on a milk-white steed, a circumstance, in the French ceremonial,
of singular importance: the white color is considered as the symbol of
sovereignty; and, in a late visit, the German emperor, after a haughty
demand and a peevish refusal, had been reduced to content himself with a
black courser. Manuel was lodged in the Louvre; a succession of feasts
and balls, the pleasures of the banquet and the chase, were ingeniously
varied by the politeness of the French, to display their magnificence,
and amuse his grief: he was indulged in the liberty of his chapel; and
the doctors of the Sorbonne were astonished, and possibly scandalized,
by the language, the rites, and the vestments, of his Greek clergy. But
the slightest glance on the state of the kingdom must teach him to
despair of any effectual assistance. The unfortunate Charles, though he
enjoyed some lucid intervals, continually relapsed into furious or
stupid insanity: the reins of government were alternately seized by his
brother and uncle, the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy, whose factious
competition prepared the miseries of civil war. The former was a gay
youth, dissolved in luxury and love: the latter was the father of John
count of Nevers, who had so lately been ransomed from Turkish captivity;
and, if the fearless son was ardent to revenge his defeat, the more
prudent Burgundy was content with the cost and peril of the first
experiment. When Manuel had satiated the curiosity, and perhaps fatigued
the patience, of the French, he resolved on a visit to the adjacent
island. In his progress from Dover, he was entertained at Canterbury
with due reverence by the prior and monks of St. Austin; and, on
Blackheath, King Henry the Fourth, with the English court, saluted the
Greek hero, (I copy our old historian,) who, during many days, was
lodged and treated in London as emperor of the East. ^19 But the state
of England was still more adverse to the design of the holy war. In the
same year, the hereditary sovereign had been deposed and murdered: the
reigning prince was a successful usurper, whose ambition was punished by
jealousy and remorse: nor could Henry of Lancaster withdraw his person
or forces from the defence of a throne incessantly shaken by conspiracy
and rebellion. He pitied, he praised, he feasted, the emperor of
Constantinople; but if the English monarch assumed the cross, it was
only to appease his people, and perhaps his conscience, by the merit or
semblance of his pious intention. ^20 Satisfied, however, with gifts and
honors, Manuel returned to Paris; and, after a residence of two years in
the West, shaped his course through Germany and Italy, embarked at
Venice, and patiently expected, in the Morea, the moment of his ruin or
deliverance. Yet he had escaped the ignominious necessity of offering
his religion to public or private sale. The Latin church was distracted
by the great schism; the kings, the nations, the universities, of Europe
were divided in their obedience between the popes of Rome and Avignon;
and the emperor, anxious to conciliate the friendship of both parties,
abstained from any correspondence with the indigent and unpopular
rivals. His journey coincided with the year of the jubilee; but he
passed through Italy without desiring, or deserving, the plenary
indulgence which abolished the guilt or penance of the sins of the
faithful. The Roman pope was offended by this neglect; accused him of
irreverence to an image of Christ; and exhorted the princes of Italy to
reject and abandon the obstinate schismatic. ^21</p>
