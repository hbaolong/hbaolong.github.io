<h4 id="chapter-xxx-revolt-of-the-goths.">Chapter XXX: Revolt Of The
Goths.</h4>
<p>Part II.</p>
<p>The emperor Honorius was distinguished, above his subjects, by the
preeminence of fear, as well as of rank. The pride and luxury in which
he was educated, had not allowed him to suspect, that there existed on
the earth any power presumptuous enough to invade the repose of the
successor of Augustus. The arts of flattery concealed the impending
danger, till Alaric approached the palace of Milan. But when the sound
of war had awakened the young emperor, instead of flying to arms with
the spirit, or even the rashness, of his age, he eagerly listened to
those timid counsellors, who proposed to convey his sacred person, and
his faithful attendants, to some secure and distant station in the
provinces of Gaul. Stilicho alone ^34 had courage and authority to
resist his disgraceful measure, which would have abandoned Rome and
Italy to the Barbarians; but as the troops of the palace had been lately
detached to the Rhaetian frontier, and as the resource of new levies was
slow and precarious, the general of the West could only promise, that if
the court of Milan would maintain their ground during his absence, he
would soon return with an army equal to the encounter of the Gothic
king. Without losing a moment, (while each moment was so important to
the public safety,) Stilicho hastily embarked on the Larian Lake,
ascended the mountains of ice and snow, amidst the severity of an Alpine
winter, and suddenly repressed, by his unexpected presence, the enemy,
who had disturbed the tranquillity of Rhaetia. ^35 The Barbarians,
perhaps some tribes of the Alemanni, respected the firmness of a chief,
who still assumed the language of command; and the choice which he
condescended to make, of a select number of their bravest youth, was
considered as a mark of his esteem and favor. The cohorts, who were
delivered from the neighboring foe, diligently repaired to the Imperial
standard; and Stilicho issued his orders to the most remote troops of
the West, to advance, by rapid marches, to the defence of Honorius and
of Italy. The fortresses of the Rhine were abandoned; and the safety of
Gaul was protected only by the faith of the Germans, and the ancient
terror of the Roman name. Even the legion, which had been stationed to
guard the wall of Britain against the Caledonians of the North, was
hastily recalled; ^36 and a numerous body of the cavalry of the Alani
was persuaded to engage in the service of the emperor, who anxiously
expected the return of his general. The prudence and vigor of Stilicho
were conspicuous on this occasion, which revealed, at the same time, the
weakness of the falling empire. The legions of Rome, which had long
since languished in the gradual decay of discipline and courage, were
exterminated by the Gothic and civil wars; and it was found impossible,
without exhausting and exposing the provinces, to assemble an army for
the defence of Italy.</p>
<p>[Footnote 34: Solus erat Stilicho, andandandandc., is the exclusive
commendation which Claudian bestows, (del Bell. Get. 267,) without
condescending to except the emperor. How insignificant must Honorius
have appeared in his own court.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 35: The face of the country, and the hardiness of Stilicho,
are finely described, (de Bell. Get. 340 - 363.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 36: Venit et extremis legio praetenta Britannis,</p>
<p>Quae Scoto dat frena truci.</p>
<p>De Bell. Get. 416.</p>
<p>Yet the most rapid march from Edinburgh, or Newcastle, to Milan, must
have required a longer space of time than Claudian seems willing to
allow for the duration of the Gothic war.]</p>
