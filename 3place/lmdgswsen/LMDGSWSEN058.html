XVI: Conduct Towards The Christians, From Nero To Constantine.</h4>
<p>Part IV.</p>
<p>When Valerian was consul for the third, and Gallienus for the fourth
time, Paternus, proconsul of Africa, summoned Cyprian to appear in his
private council-chamber. He there acquainted him with the Imperial
mandate which he had just received, ^81 that those who had abandoned the
Roman religion should immediately return to the practice of the
ceremonies of their ancestors. Cyprian replied without hesitation, that
he was a Christian and a bishop, devoted to the worship of the true and
only Deity, to whom he offered up his daily supplications for the safety
and prosperity of the two emperors, his lawful sovereigns.</p>
<p>With modest confidence he pleaded the privilege of a citizen, in
refusing to give any answer to some invidious and indeed illegal
questions which the proconsul had proposed. A sentence of banishment was
pronounced as the penalty of Cyprian’s disobedience; and he was
conducted without delay to Curubis, a free and maritime city of
Zeugitania, in a pleasant situation, a fertile territory, and at the
distance of about forty miles from Carthage. ^82 The exiled bishop
enjoyed the conveniences of life and the consciousness of virtue. His
reputation was diffused over Africa and Italy; an account of his
behavior was published for the edification of the Christian world; ^83
and his solitude was frequently interrupted by the letters, the visits,
and the congratulations of the faithful. On the arrival of a new
proconsul in the province the fortune of Cyprian appeared for some time
to wear a still more favorable aspect. He was recalled from banishment;
and though not yet permitted to return to Carthage, his own gardens in
the neighborhood of the capital were assigned for the place of his
residence. ^84</p>
<p>[Footnote 81: It should seem that these were circular orders, sent at
the same time to all the governors. Dionysius (ap. Euseb. l. vii. c. 11)
relates the history of his own banishment from Alexandria almost in the
same manner. But as he escaped and survived the persecution, we must
account him either more or less fortunate than Cyprian.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 82: See Plin. Hist. Natur. v. 3. Cellarius, Geograph.
Antiq. part iii. p. 96. Shaw’s Travels, p. 90; and for the adjacent
country, (which is terminated by Cape Bona, or the promontory of
Mercury,) l’Afrique de Marmol. tom. ii. p. 494. There are the remains of
an aqueduct near Curubis, or Curbis, at present altered into Gurbes; and
Dr. Shaw read an inscription, which styles that city Colonia Fulvia. The
deacon Pontius (in Vit. Cyprian. c. 12) calls it “Apricum et competentem
locum, hospitium pro voluntate secretum, et quicquid apponi eis ante
promissum est, qui regnum et justitiam Dei quaerunt.“]</p>
<p>[Footnote 83: See Cyprian. Epistol. 77, edit. Fell.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 84: Upon his conversion, he had sold those gardens for the
benefit of the poor. The indulgence of God (most probably the liberality
of some Christian friend) restored them to Cyprian. See Pontius,
c. 15.]</p>
<p>At length, exactly one year ^85 after Cyprian was first apprehended,
Galerius Maximus, proconsul of Africa, received the Imperial warrant for
the execution of the Christian teachers. The bishop of Carthage was
sensible that he should be singled out for one of the first victims; and
the frailty of nature tempted him to withdraw himself, by a secret
flight, from the danger and the honor of martyrdom; ^* but soon
recovering that fortitude which his character required, he returned to
his gardens, and patiently expected the ministers of death. Two officers
of rank, who were intrusted with that commission, placed Cyprian between
them in a chariot, and as the proconsul was not then at leisure, they
conducted him, not to a prison, but to a private house in Carthage,
which belonged to one of them. An elegant supper was provided for the
entertainment of the bishop, and his Christian friends were permitted
for the last time to enjoy his society, whilst the streets were filled
with a multitude of the faithful, anxious and alarmed at the approaching
fate of their spiritual father. ^86 In the morning he appeared before
the tribunal of the proconsul, who, after informing himself of the name
and situation of Cyprian, commanded him to offer sacrifice, and pressed
him to reflect on the consequences of his disobedience. The refusal of
Cyprian was firm and decisive; and the magistrate, when he had taken the
opinion of his council, pronounced with some reluctance the sentence of
death. It was conceived in the following terms: “That Thascius Cyprianus
should be immediately beheaded, as the enemy of the gods of Rome, and as
the chief and ringleader of a criminal association, which he had seduced
into an impious resistance against the laws of the most holy emperors,
Valerian and Gallienus.“ ^87 The manner of his execution was the mildest
and least painful that could be inflicted on a person convicted of any
capital offence; nor was the use of torture admitted to obtain from the
bishop of Carthage either the recantation of his principles or the
discovery of his accomplices.</p>
<p>[Footnote 85: When Cyprian; a twelvemonth before, was sent into
exile, he dreamt that he should be put to death the next day. The event
made it necessary to explain that word, as signifying a year. Pontius,
c. 12.]</p>
<p>[Footnote *: This was not, as it appears, the motive which induced
St. Cyprian to conceal himself for a short time; he was threatened to be
carried to Utica; he preferred remaining at Carthage, in order to suffer
martyrdom in the midst of his flock, and in order that his death might
conduce to the edification of those whom he had guided during life.
Such, at least, is his own explanation of his conduct in one of his
letters: Cum perlatum ad nos fuisset, fratres carissimi, frumentarios
esse missos qui me Uticam per ducerent, consilioque carissimorum
persuasum est, ut de hortis interim recederemus, justa interveniente
causa, consensi; eo quod congruat episcopum in ea civitate, in qua
Ecclesiae dominicae praeest, illie. Dominum confiteri et plebem
universam praepositi praesentis confessione clarificari Ep. 83. - G]</p>
<p>[Footnote 86: Pontius (c. 15) acknowledges that Cyprian, with whom he
supped, passed the night custodia delicata. The bishop exercised a last
and very proper act of jurisdiction, by directing that the younger
females, who watched in the streets, should be removed from the dangers
and temptations of a nocturnal crowd. Act. Preconsularia, c. 2.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 87: See the original sentence in the Acts, c. 4; and in
Pontius, c. 17 The latter expresses it in a more rhetorical manner.]</p>
<p>As soon as the sentence was proclaimed, a general cry of “We will die
with him,“ arose at once among the listening multitude of Christians who
waited before the palace gates. The generous effusions of their zeal and
their affection were neither serviceable to Cyprian nor dangerous to
themselves. He was led away under a guard of tribunes and centurions,
without resistance and without insult, to the place of his execution, a
spacious and level plain near the city, which was already filled with
great numbers of spectators. His faithful presbyters and deacons were
permitted to accompany their holy bishop. ^* They assisted him in laying
aside his upper garment, spread linen on the ground to catch the
precious relics of his blood, and received his orders to bestow
five-and-twenty pieces of gold on the executioner. The martyr then
covered his face with his hands, and at one blow his head was separated
from his body. His corpse remained during some hours exposed to the
curiosity of the Gentiles: but in the night it was removed, and
transported in a triumphal procession, and with a splendid illumination,
to the burial-place of the Christians. The funeral of Cyprian was
publicly celebrated without receiving any interruption from the Roman
magistrates; and those among the faithful, who had performed the last
offices to his person and his memory, were secure from the danger of
inquiry or of punishment. It is remarkable, that of so great a multitude
of bishops in the province of Africa, Cyprian was the first who was
esteemed worthy to obtain the crown of martyrdom. ^88</p>
<p>[Footnote *: There is nothing in the life of St. Cyprian, by Pontius,
nor in the ancient manuscripts, which can make us suppose that the
presbyters and deacons in their clerical character, and known to be
such, had the permission to attend their holy bishop. Setting aside all
religious considerations, it is impossible not to be surprised at the
kind of complaisance with which the historian here insists, in favor of
the persecutors, on some mitigating circumstances allowed at the death
of a man whose only crime was maintaining his own opinions with
frankness and courage. - G.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 88: Pontius, c. 19. M. de Tillemont (Memoires, tom. iv.
part i. p. 450, note 50) is not pleased with so positive an exclusion of
any former martyr of the episcopal rank.</p>
<p>Note: M. de. Tillemont, as an honest writer, explains the
difficulties which he felt about the text of Pontius, and concludes by
distinctly stating, that without doubt there is some mistake, and that
Pontius must have meant only Africa Minor or Carthage; for St. Cyprian,
in his 58th (69th) letter addressed to Pupianus, speaks expressly of
many bishops his colleagues, qui proscripti sunt, vel apprehensi in
carcere et catenis fuerunt; aut qui in exilium relegati, illustri
itinere ed Dominum profecti sunt; aut qui quibusdam locis animadversi,
coeleses coronas de Domini clarificatione sumpserunt. - G.]</p>
<p>It was in the choice of Cyprian, either to die a martyr, or to live
an apostate; but on the choice depended the alternative of honor or
infamy. Could we suppose that the bishop of Carthage had employed the
profession of the Christian faith only as the instrument of his avarice
or ambition, it was still incumbent on him to support the character he
had assumed; ^89 and if he possessed the smallest degree of manly
fortitude, rather to expose himself to the most cruel tortures, than by
a single act to exchange the reputation of a whole life, for the
abhorrence of his Christian brethren, and the contempt of the Gentile
world. But if the zeal of Cyprian was supported by the sincere
conviction of the truth of those doctrines which he preached, the crown
of martyrdom must have appeared to him as an object of desire rather
than of terror. It is not easy to extract any distinct ideas from the
vague though eloquent declamations of the Fathers, or to ascertain the
degree of immortal glory and happiness which they confidently promised
to those who were so fortunate as to shed their blood in the cause of
religion. ^90 They inculcated with becoming diligence, that the fire of
martyrdom supplied every defect and expiated every sin; that while the
souls of ordinary Christians were obliged to pass through a slow and
painful purification, the triumphant sufferers entered into the
immediate fruition of eternal bliss, where, in the society of the
patriarchs, the apostles, and the prophets, they reigned with Christ,
and acted as his assessors in the universal judgment of mankind. The
assurance of a lasting reputation upon earth, a motive so congenial to
the vanity of human nature, often served to animate the courage of the
martyrs.</p>
<p>The honors which Rome or Athens bestowed on those citizens who had
fallen in the cause of their country, were cold and unmeaning
demonstrations of respect, when compared with the ardent gratitude and
devotion which the primitive church expressed towards the victorious
champions of the faith. The annual commemoration of their virtues and
sufferings was observed as a sacred ceremony, and at length terminated
in religious worship. Among the Christians who had publicly confessed
their religious principles, those who (as it very frequently happened)
had been dismissed from the tribunal or the prisons of the Pagan
magistrates, obtained such honors as were justly due to their imperfect
martyrdom and their generous resolution. The most pious females courted
the permission of imprinting kisses on the fetters which they had worn,
and on the wounds which they had received. Their persons were esteemed
holy, their decisions were admitted with deference, and they too often
abused, by their spiritual pride and licentious manners, the preeminence
which their zeal and intrepidity had acquired. ^91 Distinctions like
these, whilst they display the exalted merit, betray the inconsiderable
number of those who suffered, and of those who died, for the profession
of Christianity.</p>
<p>[Footnote 89: Whatever opinion we may entertain of the character or
principles of Thomas Becket, we must acknowledge that he suffered death
with a constancy not unworthy of the primitive martyrs. See Lord
Lyttleton’s History of Henry II. vol. ii. p. 592, andandandandc.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 90: See in particular the treatise of Cyprian de Lapsis,
p. 87- 98, edit. Fell. The learning of Dodwell (Dissertat. Cyprianic.
xii. xiii.,) and the ingenuity of Middleton, (Free Inquiry, p. 162,
andandandandc.,) have left scarcely any thing to add concerning the
merit, the honors, and the motives of the martyrs.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 91: Cyprian. Epistol. 5, 6, 7, 22, 24; and de Unitat.
Ecclesiae. The number of pretended martyrs has been very much
multiplied, by the custom which was introduced of bestowing that
honorable name on confessors. Note: M. Guizot denies that the letters of
Cyprian, to which he refers, bear out the statement in the text. I
cannot scruple to admit the accuracy of Gibbon’s quotation. To take only
the fifth letter, we find this passage: Doleo enim quando audio quosdam
improbe et insolenter discurrere, et ad ineptian vel ad discordias
vacare, Christi membra et jam Christum confessa per concubitus illicitos
inquinari, nec a diaconis aut presbyteris regi posse, sed id agere ut
per paucorum pravos et malos mores, multorum et bonorum confessorum
gloria honesta maculetur. Gibbon’s misrepresentation lies in the
ambiguous expression “too often.“ Were the epistles arranged in a
different manner in the edition consulted by M. Guizot? - M.]</p>
<p>The sober discretion of the present age will more readily censure
than admire, but can more easily admire than imitate, the fervor of the
first Christians, who, according to the lively expressions of Sulpicius
Severus, desired martyrdom with more eagerness than his own
contemporaries solicited a bishopric. ^92 The epistles which Ignatius
composed as he was carried in chains through the cities of Asia, breathe
sentiments the most repugnant to the ordinary feelings of human nature.
He earnestly beseeches the Romans, that when he should be exposed in the
amphitheatre, they would not, by their kind but unseasonable
intercession, deprive him of the crown of glory; and he declares his
resolution to provoke and irritate the wild beasts which might be
employed as the instruments of his death. ^93 Some stories are related
of the courage of martyrs, who actually performed what Ignatius had
intended; who exasperated the fury of the lions, pressed the executioner
to hasten his office, cheerfully leaped into the fires which were
kindled to consume them, and discovered a sensation of joy and pleasure
in the midst of the most exquisite tortures. Several examples have been
preserved of a zeal impatient of those restraints which the emperors had
provided for the security of the church. The Christians sometimes
supplied by their voluntary declaration the want of an accuser, rudely
disturbed the public service of paganism, ^94 and rushing in crowds
round the tribunal of the magistrates, called upon them to pronounce and
to inflict the sentence of the law. The behavior of the Christians was
too remarkable to escape the notice of the ancient philosophers; but
they seem to have considered it with much less admiration than
astonishment. Incapable of conceiving the motives which sometimes
transported the fortitude of believers beyond the bounds of prudence or
reason, they treated such an eagerness to die as the strange result of
obstinate despair, of stupid insensibility, or of superstitious frenzy.
^95 “Unhappy men!“ exclaimed the proconsul Antoninus to the Christians
of Asia; “unhappy men! if you are thus weary of your lives, is it so
difficult for you to find ropes and precipices?“ ^96 He was extremely
cautious (as it is observed by a learned and picus historian) of
punishing men who had found no accusers but themselves, the Imperial
laws not having made any provision for so unexpected a case: condemning
therefore a few as a warning to their brethren, he dismissed the
multitude with indignation and contempt. ^97 Notwithstanding this real
or affected disdain, the intrepid constancy of the faithful was
productive of more salutary effects on those minds which nature or grace
had disposed for the easy reception of religious truth. On these
melancholy occasions, there were many among the Gentiles who pitied, who
admired, and who were converted. The generous enthusiasm was
communicated from the sufferer to the spectators; and the blood of
martyrs, according to a well-known observation, became the seed of the
church.</p>
<p>[Footnote 92: Certatim gloriosa in certamina ruebatur; multique
avidius tum martyria gloriosis mortibus quaerebantur, quam nunc
Episcopatus pravis ambitionibus appetuntur. Sulpicius Severus, l. ii. He
might have omitted the word nunc.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 93: See Epist. ad Roman. c. 4, 5, ap. Patres Apostol. tom.
ii. p. 27. It suited the purpose of Bishop Pearson (see Vindiciae
Ignatianae, part ii. c. 9) to justify, by a profusion of examples and
authorities, the sentiments of Ignatius.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 94: The story of Polyeuctes, on which Corneille has founded
a very beautiful tragedy, is one of the most celebrated, though not
perhaps the most authentic, instances of this excessive zeal. We should
observe, that the 60th canon of the council of Illiberis refuses the
title of martyrs to those who exposed themselves to death, by publicly
destroying the idols.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 95: See Epictetus, l. iv. c. 7, (though there is some doubt
whether he alludes to the Christians.) Marcus Antoninus de Rebus suis,
l. xi. c. 3 Lucian in Peregrin.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 96: Tertullian ad Scapul. c. 5. The learned are divided
between three persons of the same name, who were all proconsuls of Asia.
I am inclined to ascribe this story to Antoninus Pius, who was
afterwards emperor; and who may have governed Asia under the reign of
Trajan.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 97: Mosheim, de Rebus Christ, ante Constantin. p. 235.]</p>
<p>But although devotion had raised, and eloquence continued to inflame,
this fever of the mind, it insensibly gave way to the more natural hopes
and fears of the human heart, to the love of life, the apprehension of
pain, and the horror of dissolution. The more prudent rulers of the
church found themselves obliged to restrain the indiscreet ardor of
their followers, and to distrust a constancy which too often abandoned
them in the hour of trial. ^98 As the lives of the faithful became less
mortified and austere, they were every day less ambitious of the honors
of martyrdom; and the soldiers of Christ, instead of distinguishing
themselves by voluntary deeds of heroism, frequently deserted their
post, and fled in confusion before the enemy whom it was their duty to
resist. There were three methods, however, of escaping the flames of
persecution, which were not attended with an equal degree of guilt:
first, indeed, was generally allowed to be innocent; the second was of a
doubtful, or at least of a venial, nature; but the third implied a
direct and criminal apostasy from the Christian faith.</p>
<p>[Footnote 98: See the Epistle of the Church of Smyrna, ap. Euseb.
Hist. Eccles. Liv. c. 15</p>
<p>Note: The 15th chapter of the 10th book of the Eccles. History of
Eusebius treats principally of the martyrdom of St. Polycarp, and
mentions some other martyrs. A single example of weakness is related; it
is that of a Phrygian named Quintus, who, appalled at the sight of the
wild beasts and the tortures, renounced his faith. This example proves
little against the mass of Christians, and this chapter of Eusebius
furnished much stronger evidence of their courage than of their
timidity. - G</p>
<p>This Quintus had, however, rashly and of his own accord appeared
before the tribunal; and the church of Smyrna condemn “his indiscreet
ardor,“ coupled as it was with weakness in the hour of trial. - M.]</p>
<p>I. A modern inquisitor would hear with surprise, that whenever an
information was given to a Roman magistrate of any person within his
jurisdiction who had embraced the sect of the Christians, the charge was
communicated to the party accused, and that a convenient time was
allowed him to settle his domestic concerns, and to prepare an answer to
the crime which was imputed to him. ^99 If he entertained any doubt of
his own constancy, such a delay afforded him the opportunity of
preserving his life and honor by flight, of withdrawing himself into
some obscure retirement or some distant province, and of patiently
expecting the return of peace and security. A measure so consonant to
reason was soon authorized by the advice and example of the most holy
prelates; and seems to have been censured by few except by the
Montanists, who deviated into heresy by their strict and obstinate
adherence to the rigor of ancient discipline. ^100 II. The provincial
governors, whose zeal was less prevalent than their avarice, had
countenanced the practice of selling certificates, (or libels, as they
were called,) which attested, that the persons therein mentioned had
complied with the laws, and sacrificed to the Roman deities. By
producing these false declarations, the opulent and timid Christians
were enabled to silence the malice of an informer, and to reconcile in
some measure their safety with their religion. A slight penance atoned
for this profane dissimulation. ^101 ^* III. In every persecution there
were great numbers of unworthy Christians who publicly disowned or
renounced the faith which they had professed; and who confirmed the
sincerity of their abjuration, by the legal acts of burning incense or
of offering sacrifices. Some of these apostates had yielded on the first
menace or exhortation of the magistrate; whilst the patience of others
had been subdued by the length and repetition of tortures. The
affrighted countenances of some betrayed their inward remorse, while
others advanced with confidence and alacrity to the altars of the gods.
^102 But the disguise which fear had imposed, subsisted no longer than
the present danger. As soon as the severity of the persecution was
abated, the doors of the churches were assailed by the returning
multitude of penitents who detested their idolatrous submission, and who
solicited with equal ardor, but with various success, their readmission
into the society of Christians. ^103 ^!</p>
<p>[Footnote 99: In the second apology of Justin, there is a particular
and very curious instance of this legal delay. The same indulgence was
granted to accused Christians, in the persecution of Decius: and Cyprian
(de Lapsis) expressly mentions the “Dies negantibus praestitutus.“</p>
<p>Note: The examples drawn by the historian from Justin Martyr and
Cyprian relate altogether to particular cases, and prove nothing as to
the general practice adopted towards the accused; it is evident, on the
contrary, from the same apology of St. Justin, that they hardly ever
obtained delay. “A man named Lucius, himself a Christian, present at an
unjust sentence passed against a Christian by the judge Urbicus, asked
him why he thus punished a man who was neither adulterer nor robber, nor
guilty of any other crime but that of avowing himself a Christian.“
Urbicus answered only in these words: “Thou also hast the appearance of
being a Christian.“ “Yes, without doubt,“ replied Lucius. The judge
ordered that he should be put to death on the instant. A third, who came
up, was condemned to be beaten with rods. Here, then, are three examples
where no delay was granted.</p>
<p>[Surely these acts of a single passionate and irritated judge prove
the general practice as little as those quoted by Gibbon. - M.]</p>
<p>There exist a multitude of others, such as those of Ptolemy,
Marcellus, andandandandc. Justin expressly charges the judges with
ordering the accused to be executed without hearing the cause. The words
of St. Cyprian are as particular, and simply say, that he had appointed
a day by which the Christians must have renounced their faith; those who
had not done it by that time were condemned. - G. This confirms the
statement in the text. - M.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 100: Tertullian considers flight from persecution as an
imperfect, but very criminal, apostasy, as an impious attempt to elude
the will of God, andandandandc., andandandandc. He has written a
treatise on this subject, (see p. 536 - 544, edit. Rigalt.,) which is
filled with the wildest fanaticism and the most incoherent declamation.
It is, however, somewhat remarkable, that Tertullian did not suffer
martyrdom himself.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 101: The libellatici, who are chiefly known by the writings
of Cyprian, are described with the utmost precision, in the copious
commentary of Mosheim, p. 483 - 489.]</p>
<p>[Footnote *: The penance was not so slight, for it was exactly the
same with that of apostates who had sacrificed to idols; it lasted
several years. See Fleun Hist. Ecc. v. ii. p. 171. - G.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 102: Plin. Epist. x. 97. Dionysius Alexandrin. ap. Euseb.
l. vi. c. 41. Ad prima statim verba minantis inimici maximus fratrum
numerus fidem suam prodidit: nec prostratus est persecutionis impetu,
sed voluntario lapsu seipsum prostravit. Cyprian. Opera, p. 89. Among
these deserters were many priests, and even bishops.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 103: It was on this occasion that Cyprian wrote his
treatise De Lapsis, and many of his epistles. The controversy concerning
the treatment of penitent apostates, does not occur among the Christians
of the preceding century. Shall we ascribe this to the superiority of
their faith and courage, or to our less intimate knowledge of their
history!]</p>
<p>[Footnote !: Pliny says, that the greater part of the Christians
persisted in avowing themselves to be so; the reason for his consulting
Trajan was the periclitantium numerus. Eusebius (l. vi. c. 41) does not
permit us to doubt that the number of those who renounced their faith
was infinitely below the number of those who boldly confessed it. The
prefect, he says and his assessors present at the council, were alarmed
at seeing the crowd of Christians; the judges themselves trembled.
Lastly, St. Cyprian informs us, that the greater part of those who had
appeared weak brethren in the persecution of Decius, signalized their
courage in that of Gallius. Steterunt fortes, et ipso dolore
poenitentiae facti ad praelium fortiores Epist. lx. p. 142. - G.]</p>

<li>Notwithstanding the general rules established for the conviction and
punishment of the Christians, the fate of those sectaries, in an
extensive and arbitrary government, must still in a great measure, have
depended on their own behavior, the circumstances of the times, and the
temper of their supreme as well as subordinate rulers. Zeal might
sometimes provoke, and prudence might sometimes avert or assuage, the
superstitious fury of the Pagans. A variety of motives might dispose the
provincial governors either to enforce or to relax the execution of the
laws; and of these motives the most forcible was their regard not only
for the public edicts, but for the secret intentions of the emperor, a
glance from whose eye was sufficient to kindle or to extinguish the
flames of persecution. As often as any occasional severities were
exercised in the different parts of the empire, the primitive Christians
lamented and perhaps magnified their own sufferings; but the celebrated
number of ten persecutions has been determined by the ecclesiastical
writers of the fifth century, who possessed a more distinct view of the
prosperous or adverse fortunes of the church, from the age of Nero to
that of Diocletian. The ingenious parallels of the ten plagues of Egypt,
and of the ten horns of the Apocalypse, first suggested this calculation
to their minds; and in their application of the faith of prophecy to the
truth of history, they were careful to select those reigns which were
indeed the most hostile to the Christian cause. ^104 But these transient
persecutions served only to revive the zeal and to restore the
discipline of the faithful; and the moments of extraordinary rigor were
compensated by much longer intervals of peace and security. The
indifference of some princes, and the indulgence of others, permitted
the Christians to enjoy, though not perhaps a legal, yet an actual and
public, toleration of their religion.</li>

author of this computation; though he seemed desirous of reserving the
tenth and greatest persecution for the coming of the Antichrist.]</p>
