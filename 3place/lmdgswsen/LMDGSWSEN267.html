LXI: Partition Of The Empire By The French And Venetians.</h4>
<p>Part III.</p>
<p>In the profession of Christianity, in the cultivation of a fertile
land, the northern conquerors of the Roman empire insensibly mingled
with the provincials, and rekindled the embers of the arts of antiquity.
Their settlements about the age of Charlemagne had acquired some degree
of order and stability, when they were overwhelmed by new swarms of
invaders, the Normans, Saracens, ^68 and Hungarians, who replunged the
western countries of Europe into their former state of anarchy and
barbarism. About the eleventh century, the second tempest had subsided
by the expulsion or conversion of the enemies of Christendom: the tide
of civilization, which had so long ebbed, began to flow with a steady
and accelerated course; and a fairer prospect was opened to the hopes
and efforts of the rising generations. Great was the increase, and rapid
the progress, during the two hundred years of the crusades; and some
philosophers have applauded the propitious influence of these holy wars,
which appear to me to have checked rather than forwarded the maturity of
Europe. ^69 The lives and labors of millions, which were buried in the
East, would have been more profitably employed in the improvement of
their native country: the accumulated stock of industry and wealth would
have overflowed in navigation and trade; and the Latins would have been
enriched and enlightened by a pure and friendly correspondence with the
climates of the East. In one respect I can indeed perceive the
accidental operation of the crusades, not so much in producing a benefit
as in removing an evil. The larger portion of the inhabitants of Europe
was chained to the soil, without freedom, or property, or knowledge; and
the two orders of ecclesiastics and nobles, whose numbers were
comparatively small, alone deserved the name of citizens and men. This
oppressive system was supported by the arts of the clergy and the swords
of the barons. The authority of the priests operated in the darker ages
as a salutary antidote: they prevented the total extinction of letters,
mitigated the fierceness of the times, sheltered the poor and
defenceless, and preserved or revived the peace and order of civil
society. But the independence, rapine, and discord of the feudal lords
were unmixed with any semblance of good; and every hope of industry and
improvement was crushed by the iron weight of the martial aristocracy.
Among the causes that undermined that Gothic edifice, a conspicuous
place must be allowed to the crusades. The estates of the barons were
dissipated, and their race was often extinguished, in these costly and
perilous expeditions. Their poverty extorted from their pride those
charters of freedom which unlocked the fetters of the slave, secured the
farm of the peasant and the shop of the artificer, and gradually
restored a substance and a soul to the most numerous and useful part of
the community. The conflagration which destroyed the tall and barren
trees of the forest gave air and scope to the vegetation of the smaller
and nutritive plants of the soil. ^*</p>
<p>[Footnote 68: If I rank the Saracens with the Barbarians, it is only
relative to their wars, or rather inroads, in Italy and France, where
their sole purpose was to plunder and destroy.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 69: On this interesting subject, the progress of society in
Europe, a strong ray of philosophical light has broke from Scotland in
our own times; and it is with private, as well as public regard, that I
repeat the names of Hume, Robertson, and Adam Smith.]</p>
<p>[Footnote *: On the consequences of the crusades, compare the
valuable Essay of Reeren, that of M. Choiseul d’Aillecourt, and a
chapter of Mr. Forster’s “Mahometanism Unveiled.“ I may admire this
gentleman’s learning and industry, without pledging myself to his wild
theory of prophets interpretation. - M.]</p>
<p>Digression On The Family Of Courtenay.</p>
<p>The purple of three emperors, who have reigned at Constantinople,
will authorize or excuse a digression on the origin and singular
fortunes of the house of Courtenay, ^70 in the three principal branches:
I. Of Edessa; II. Of France; and III. Of England; of which the last only
has survived the revolutions of eight hundred years.</p>
<p>[Footnote 70: I have applied, but not confined, myself to A
genealogical History of the noble and illustrious Family of Courtenay,
by Ezra Cleaveland, Tutor to Sir William Courtenay, and Rector of
Honiton; Exon. 1735, in folio. The first part is extracted from William
of Tyre; the second from Bouchet’s French history; and the third from
various memorials, public, provincial, and private, of the Courtenays of
Devonshire The rector of Honiton has more gratitude than industry, and
more industry than criticism.]</p>
<p>I. Before the introduction of trade, which scatters riches, and of
knowledge, which dispels prejudice, the prerogative of birth is most
strongly felt and most humbly acknowledged. In every age, the laws and
manners of the Germans have discriminated the ranks of society; the
dukes and counts, who shared the empire of Charlemagne, converted their
office to an inheritance; and to his children, each feudal lord
bequeathed his honor and his sword. The proudest families are content to
lose, in the darkness of the middle ages, the tree of their pedigree,
which, however deep and lofty, must ultimately rise from a plebeian
root; and their historians must descend ten centuries below the
Christian aera, before they can ascertain any lineal succession by the
evidence of surnames, of arms, and of authentic records. With the first
rays of light, ^71 we discern the nobility and opulence of Atho, a
French knight; his nobility, in the rank and title of a nameless father;
his opulence, in the foundation of the castle of Courtenay in the
district of Gatinois, about fifty-six miles to the south of Paris. From
the reign of Robert, the son of Hugh Capet, the barons of Courtenay are
conspicuous among the immediate vassals of the crown; and Joscelin, the
grandson of Atho and a noble dame, is enrolled among the heroes of the
first crusade. A domestic alliance (their mothers were sisters) attached
him to the standard of Baldwin of Bruges, the second count of Edessa; a
princely fief, which he was worthy to receive, and able to maintain,
announces the number of his martial followers; and after the departure
of his cousin, Joscelin himself was invested with the county of Edessa
on both sides of the Euphrates. By economy in peace, his territories
were replenished with Latin and Syrian subjects; his magazines with
corn, wine, and oil; his castles with gold and silver, with arms and
horses. In a holy warfare of thirty years, he was alternately a
conqueror and a captive: but he died like a soldier, in a horse litter
at the head of his troops; and his last glance beheld the flight of the
Turkish invaders who had presumed on his age and infirmities. His son
and successor, of the same name, was less deficient in valor than in
vigilance; but he sometimes forgot that dominion is acquired and
maintained by the same arms. He challenged the hostility of the Turks,
without securing the friendship of the prince of Antioch; and, amidst
the peaceful luxury of Turbessel, in Syria, ^72 Joscelin neglected the
defence of the Christian frontier beyond the Euphrates. In his absence,
Zenghi, the first of the Atabeks, besieged and stormed his capital,
Edessa, which was feebly defended by a timorous and disloyal crowd of
Orientals: the Franks were oppressed in a bold attempt for its recovery,
and Courtenay ended his days in the prison of Aleppo. He still left a
fair and ample patrimony But the victorious Turks oppressed on all sides
the weakness of a widow and orphan; and, for the equivalent of an annual
pension, they resigned to the Greek emperor the charge of defending, and
the shame of losing, the last relics of the Latin conquest. The
countess-dowager of Edessa retired to Jerusalem with her two children;
the daughter, Agnes, became the wife and mother of a king; the son,
Joscelin the Third, accepted the office of seneschal, the first of the
kingdom, and held his new estates in Palestine by the service of fifty
knights. His name appears with honor in the transactions of peace and
war; but he finally vanishes in the fall of Jerusalem; and the name of
Courtenay, in this branch of Edessa, was lost by the marriage of his two
daughters with a French and German baron. ^73</p>
<p>[Footnote 71: The primitive record of the family is a passage of the
continuator of Aimoin, a monk of Fleury, who wrote in the xiith century.
See his Chronicle, in the Historians of France, (tom. xi. p. 276.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 72: Turbessel, or, as it is now styled, Telbesher, is fixed
by D’Anville four-and-twenty miles from the great passage over the
Euphrates at Zeugma.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 73: His possessions are distinguished in the Assises of
Jerusalem (c. B26) among the feudal tenures of the kingdom, which must
therefore have been collected between the years 1153 and 1187. His
pedigree may be found in the Lignages d’Outremer, c. 16.]</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>While Joscelin reigned beyond the Euphrates, his elder brother Milo,
the son of Joscelin, the son of Atho, continued, near the Seine, to
possess the castle of their fathers, which was at length inherited by
Rainaud, or Reginald, the youngest of his three sons. Examples of genius
or virtue must be rare in the annals of the oldest families; and, in a
remote age their pride will embrace a deed of rapine and violence; such,
however, as could not be perpetrated without some superiority of
courage, or, at least, of power. A descendant of Reginald of Courtenay
may blush for the public robber, who stripped and imprisoned several
merchants, after they had satisfied the king’s duties at Sens and
Orleans. He will glory in the offence, since the bold offender could not
be compelled to obedience and restitution, till the regent and the count
of Champagne prepared to march against him at the head of an army. ^74
Reginald bestowed his estates on his eldest daughter, and his daughter
on the seventh son of King Louis the Fat; and their marriage was crowned
with a numerous offspring. We might expect that a private should have
merged in a royal name; and that the descendants of Peter of France and
Elizabeth of Courtenay would have enjoyed the titles and honors of
princes of the blood. But this legitimate claim was long neglected, and
finally denied; and the causes of their disgrace will represent the
story of this second branch. 1. Of all the families now extant, the most
ancient, doubtless, and the most illustrious, is the house of France,
which has occupied the same throne above eight hundred years, and
descends, in a clear and lineal series of males, from the middle of the
ninth century. ^75 In the age of the crusades, it was already revered
both in the East and West. But from Hugh Capet to the marriage of Peter,
no more than five reigns or generations had elapsed; and so precarious
was their title, that the eldest sons, as a necessary precaution, were
previously crowned during the lifetime of their fathers. The peers of
France have long maintained their precedency before the younger branches
of the royal line, nor had the princes of the blood, in the twelfth
century, acquired that hereditary lustre which is now diffused over the
most remote candidates for the succession. 2. The barons of Courtenay
must have stood high in their own estimation, and in that of the world,
since they could impose on the son of a king the obligation of adopting
for himself and all his descendants the name and arms of their daughter
and his wife. In the marriage of an heiress with her inferior or her
equal, such exchange often required and allowed: but as they continued
to diverge from the regal stem, the sons of Louis the Fat were
insensibly confounded with their maternal ancestors; and the new
Courtenays might deserve to forfeit the honors of their birth, which a
motive of interest had tempted them to renounce. 3. The shame was far
more permanent than the reward, and a momentary blaze was followed by a
long darkness. The eldest son of these nuptials, Peter of Courtenay, had
married, as I have already mentioned, the sister of the counts of
Flanders, the two first emperors of Constantinople: he rashly accepted
the invitation of the barons of Romania; his two sons, Robert and
Baldwin, successively held and lost the remains of the Latin empire in
the East, and the granddaughter of Baldwin the Second again mingled her
blood with the blood of France and of Valois. To support the expenses of
a troubled and transitory reign, their patrimonial estates were
mortgaged or sold: and the last emperors of Constantinople depended on
the annual charity of Rome and Naples.</li>
</ol>
<p>[Footnote 74: The rapine and satisfaction of Reginald de Courtenay,
are preposterously arranged in the Epistles of the abbot and regent
Suger, (cxiv. cxvi.,) the best memorials of the age, (Duchesne,
Scriptores Hist. Franc. tom. iv. p. 530.)]</p>
<p>[Footnote 75: In the beginning of the xith century, after naming the
father and grandfather of Hugh Capet, the monk Glaber is obliged to add,
cujus genus valde in-ante reperitur obscurum. Yet we are assured that
the great- grandfather of Hugh Capet was Robert the Strong count of
Anjou, (A.D. 863 - 873,) a noble Frank of Neustria, Neustricus . . .
generosae stirpis, who was slain in the defence of his country against
the Normans, dum patriae fines tuebatur. Beyond Robert, all is
conjecture or fable. It is a probable conjecture, that the third race
descended from the second by Childebrand, the brother of Charles Martel.
It is an absurd fable that the second was allied to the first by the
marriage of Ansbert, a Roman senator and the ancestor of St. Arnoul,
with Blitilde, a daughter of Clotaire I. The Saxon origin of the house
of France is an ancient but incredible opinion. See a judicious memoir
of M. de Foncemagne, (Memoires de l’Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xx.
p. 548 - 579.) He had promised to declare his own opinion in a second
memoir, which has never appeared.]</p>
<p>While the elder brothers dissipated their wealth in romantic
adventures, and the castle of Courtenay was profaned by a plebeian
owner, the younger branches of that adopted name were propagated and
multiplied. But their splendor was clouded by poverty and time: after
the decease of Robert, great butler of France, they descended from
princes to barons; the next generations were confounded with the simple
gentry; the descendants of Hugh Capet could no longer be visible in the
rural lords of Tanlay and of Champignelles. The more adventurous
embraced without dishonor the profession of a soldier: the least active
and opulent might sink, like their cousins of the branch of Dreux, into
the condition of peasants. Their royal descent, in a dark period of four
hundred years, became each day more obsolete and ambiguous; and their
pedigree, instead of being enrolled in the annals of the kingdom, must
be painfully searched by the minute diligence of heralds and
genealogists. It was not till the end of the sixteenth century, on the
accession of a family almost as remote as their own, that the princely
spirit of the Courtenays again revived; and the question of the nobility
provoked them to ascertain the royalty of their blood. They appealed to
the justice and compassion of Henry the Fourth; obtained a favorable
opinion from twenty lawyers of Italy and Germany, and modestly compared
themselves to the descendants of King David, whose prerogatives were not
impaired by the lapse of ages or the trade of a carpenter. ^76 But every
ear was deaf, and every circumstance was adverse, to their lawful
claims. The Bourbon kings were justified by the neglect of the Valois;
the princes of the blood, more recent and lofty, disdained the alliance
of his humble kindred: the parliament, without denying their proofs,
eluded a dangerous precedent by an arbitrary distinction, and
established St. Louis as the first father of the royal line. ^77 A
repetition of complaints and protests was repeatedly disregarded; and
the hopeless pursuit was terminated in the present century by the death
of the last male of the family. ^78 Their painful and anxious situation
was alleviated by the pride of conscious virtue: they sternly rejected
the temptations of fortune and favor; and a dying Courtenay would have
sacrificed his son, if the youth could have renounced, for any temporal
interest, the right and title of a legitimate prince of the blood of
France. ^79</p>
<p>[Footnote 76: Of the various petitions, apologies, andandandandc.,
published by the princes of Courtenay, I have seen the three following,
all in octavo: 1. De Stirpe et Origine Domus de Courtenay: addita sunt
Responsa celeberrimorum Europae Jurisconsultorum; Paris, 1607. 2.
Representation du Procede tenu a l’instance faicte devant le Roi, par
Messieurs de Courtenay, pour la conservation de l’Honneur et Dignite de
leur Maison, branche de la royalle Maison de France; a Paris, 1613. 3.
Representation du subject qui a porte Messieurs de Salles et de
Fraville, de la Maison de Courtenay, a se retirer hors du Royaume, 1614.
It was a homicide, for which the Courtenays expected to be pardoned, or
tried, as princes of the blood.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 77: The sense of the parliaments is thus expressed by
Thuanus Principis nomen nusquam in Gallia tributum, nisi iis qui per
mares e regibus nostris originem repetunt; qui nunc tantum a Ludovico
none beatae memoriae numerantur; nam Cortinoei et Drocenses, a Ludovico
crasso genus ducentes, hodie inter eos minime recensentur. A distinction
of expediency rather than justice. The sanctity of Louis IX. could not
invest him with any special prerogative, and all the descendants of Hugh
Capet must be included in his original compact with the French
nation.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 78: The last male of the Courtenays was Charles Roger, who
died in the year 1730, without leaving any sons. The last female was
Helene de Courtenay, who married Louis de Beaufremont.</p>
<p>Her title of Princesse du Sang Royal de France was suppressed
(February 7th, 1737) by an arret of the parliament of Paris.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 79: The singular anecdote to which I allude is related in
the Recueil des Pieces interessantes et peu connues, (Maestricht, 1786,
in 4 vols. 12mo.;) and the unknown editor quotes his author, who had
received it from Helene de Courtenay, marquise de Beaufremont.]</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>According to the old register of Ford Abbey, the Courtenays of
Devonshire are descended from Prince Florus, the second son of Peter,
and the grandson of Louis the Fat. ^80 This fable of the grateful or
venal monks was too respectfully entertained by our antiquaries, Cambden
^81 and Dugdale: ^82 but it is so clearly repugnant to truth and time,
that the rational pride of the family now refuses to accept this
imaginary founder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Their most faithful historians believe, that, after giving his
daughter to the king’s son, Reginald of Courtenay abandoned his
possessions in France, and obtained from the English monarch a second
wife and a new inheritance. It is certain, at least, that Henry the
Second distinguished in his camps and councils a Reginald, of the name
and arms, and, as it may be fairly presumed, of the genuine race, of the
Courtenays of France. The right of wardship enabled a feudal lord to
reward his vassal with the marriage and estate of a noble heiress; and
Reginald of Courtenay acquired a fair establishment in Devonshire, where
his posterity has been seated above six hundred years. ^83 From a Norman
baron, Baldwin de Brioniis, who had been invested by the Conqueror,
Hawise, the wife of Reginald, derived the honor of Okehampton, which was
held by the service of ninety-three knights; and a female might claim
the manly offices of hereditary viscount or sheriff, and of captain of
the royal castle of Exeter. Their son Robert married the sister of the
earl of Devon: at the end of a century, on the failure of the family of
Rivers, ^84 his great-grandson, Hugh the Second, succeeded to a title
which was still considered as a territorial dignity; and twelve earls of
Devonshire, of the name of Courtenay, have flourished in a period of two
hundred and twenty years. They were ranked among the chief of the barons
of the realm; nor was it till after a strenuous dispute, that they
yielded to the fief of Arundel the first place in the parliament of
England: their alliances were contracted with the noblest families, the
Veres, Despensers, St. Johns, Talbots, Bohuns, and even the Plantagenets
themselves; and in a contest with John of Lancaster, a Courtenay, bishop
of London, and afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, might be accused of
profane confidence in the strength and number of his kindred. In peace,
the earls of Devon resided in their numerous castles and manors of the
west; their ample revenue was appropriated to devotion and hospitality;
and the epitaph of Edward, surnamed from his misfortune, the blind, from
his virtues, the good, earl, inculcates with much ingenuity a moral
sentence, which may, however, be abused by thoughtless generosity. After
a grateful commemoration of the fifty-five years of union and happiness
which he enjoyed with Mabel his wife, the good earl thus speaks from the
tomb: - “What we gave, we have; What we spent, we had; What we left, we
lost.“ ^85</p>
<p>But their losses, in this sense, were far superior to their gifts and
expenses; and their heirs, not less than the poor, were the objects of
their paternal care. The sums which they paid for livery and seizin
attest the greatness of their possessions; and several estates have
remained in their family since the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
In war, the Courtenays of England fulfilled the duties, and deserved the
honors, of chivalry. They were often intrusted to levy and command the
militia of Devonshire and Cornwall; they often attended their supreme
lord to the borders of Scotland; and in foreign service, for a
stipulated price, they sometimes maintained fourscore men-at-arms and as
many archers. By sea and land they fought under the standard of the
Edwards and Henries: their names are conspicuous in battles, in
tournaments, and in the original list of the Order of the Garter; three
brothers shared the Spanish victory of the Black Prince; and in the
lapse of six generations, the English Courtenays had learned to despise
the nation and country from which they derived their origin. In the
quarrel of the two roses, the earls of Devon adhered to the house of
Lancaster; and three brothers successively died either in the field or
on the scaffold. Their honors and estates were restored by Henry the
Seventh; a daughter of Edward the Fourth was not disgraced by the
nuptials of a Courtenay; their son, who was created Marquis of Exeter,
enjoyed the favor of his cousin Henry the Eighth; and in the camp of
Cloth of Gold, he broke a lance against the French monarch. But the
favor of Henry was the prelude of disgrace; his disgrace was the signal
of death; and of the victims of the jealous tyrant, the marquis of
Exeter is one of the most noble and guiltless. His son Edward lived a
prisoner in the Tower, and died in exile at Padua; and the secret love
of Queen Mary, whom he slighted, perhaps for the princess Elizabeth, has
shed a romantic color on the story of this beautiful youth. The relics
of his patrimony were conveyed into strange families by the marriages of
his four aunts; and his personal honors, as if they had been legally
extinct, were revived by the patents of succeeding princes. But there
still survived a lineal descendant of Hugh, the first earl of Devon, a
younger branch of the Courtenays, who have been seated at Powderham
Castle above four hundred years, from the reign of Edward the Third to
the present hour. Their estates have been increased by the grant and
improvement of lands in Ireland, and they have been recently restored to
the honors of the peerage. Yet the Courtenays still retain the plaintive
motto, which asserts the innocence, and deplores the fall, of their
ancient house. ^86 While they sigh for past greatness, they are
doubtless sensible of present blessings: in the long series of the
Courtenay annals, the most splendid aera is likewise the most
unfortunate; nor can an opulent peer of Britain be inclined to envy the
emperors of Constantinople, who wandered over Europe to solicit alms for
the support of their dignity and the defence of their capital.</p>

this fable must have been invented before the reign of Edward III. The
profuse devotion of the three first generations to Ford Abbey was
followed by oppression on one side and ingratitude on the other; and in
the sixth generation, the monks ceased to register the births, actions,
and deaths of their patrons.]</p>

Godfrey of Bouillon, and the ancient counts of Boulogne.]</p>
