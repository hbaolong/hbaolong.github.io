before us public in the Quarterly Review.]</p></li>
<li><p>: The editor regrets that he has not been able to find the
Italian translation, mentioned by Gibbon himself with some respect. It

never found any bookseller in London who has seen it.]</p></li>
<li><p>my excuse may be found in the extreme difficulty of assigning a
proper measure to such a catalogue. A naked list of names and editions
would not be satisfactory either to myself or my readers: the characters
of the principal Authors of the Roman and Byzantine History have been
occasionally connected with the events which they describe; a more
copious and critical inquiry might indeed deserve, but it would demand,
an elaborate volume, which might swell by degrees into a general library
of historical writers. For the present, I shall content myself with
renewing my serious protestation, that I have always endeavored to draw
from the fountain-head; that my curiosity, as well as a sense of duty,
has always urged me to study the originals; and that, if they have
sometimes eluded my search, I have carefully marked the secondary
evidence, on whose faith a passage or a fact were reduced to
depend.</p></li>

<li><p>Yet Phoenicia and Palestine will forever live in the memory of
mankind; since America, as well as Europe, has received letters from the
one, and religion from the other. ^83 A sandy desert, alike destitute of
wood and water, skirts along the doubtful confine of Syria, from the
Euphrates to the Red Sea. The wandering life of the Arabs was
inseparably connected with their independence; and wherever, on some
spots less barren than the rest, they ventured to for many settled
habitations, they soon became subjects to the Roman empire. ^84</p></li>
<li><p>: This comparison is exaggerated, with the intention, no doubt,
of attacking the authority of the Bible, which boasts of the fertility
of Palestine. Gibbon’s only authorities were that of Strabo (l. xvi.
1104) and the present state of the country. But Strabo only speaks of
the neighborhood of Jerusalem, which he calls barren and arid to the
extent of sixty stadia round the city: in other parts he gives a
favorable testimony to the fertility of many parts of Palestine: thus he
says, “Near Jericho there is a grove of palms, and a country of a
hundred stadia, full of springs, and well peopled.“ Moreover, Strabo had
never seen Palestine; he spoke only after reports, which may be as
inaccurate as those according to which he has composed that description
of Germany, in which Gluverius has detected so many errors. (Gluv. Germ.
iii. 1.) Finally, his testimony is contradicted and refuted by that of
other ancient authors, and by medals. Tacitus says, in speaking of
Palestine, “The inhabitants are healthy and robust; the rains moderate;
the soil fertile.“ (Hist. v. 6.) Ammianus Macellinus says also, “The
last of the Syrias is Palestine, a country of considerable extent,
abounding in clean and well-cultivated land, and containing some fine
cities, none of which yields to the other; but, as it were, being on a
parallel, are rivals.“ - xiv. 8. See also the historian Josephus, Hist.
vi. 1. Procopius of Caeserea, who lived in the sixth century, says that
Chosroes, king of Persia, had a great desire to make himself master of
Palestine, on account of its extraordinary fertility, its opulence, and
the great number of its inhabitants. The Saracens thought the same, and
were afraid that Omar. when he went to Jerusalem, charmed with the
fertility of the soil and the purity of the air, would never return to
Medina. (Ockley, Hist. of Sarac. i. 232.) The importance attached by the
Romans to the conquest of Palestine, and the obstacles they encountered,
prove also the richness and population of the country. Vespasian and
Titus caused medals to be struck with trophies, in which Palestine is
represented by a female under a palm-tree, to signify the richness of he
country, with this legend: Judea capta. Other medals also indicate this
fertility; for instance, that of Herod holding a bunch of grapes, and
that of the young Agrippa displaying fruit. As to the present state of
he country, one perceives that it is not fair to draw any inference
against its ancient fertility: the disasters through which it has
passed, the government to which it is subject, the disposition of the
inhabitants, explain sufficiently the wild and uncultivated appearance
of the land, where, nevertheless, fertile and cultivated districts are
still found, according to the testimony of travellers; among others, of
Shaw, Maundrel, La Rocque, andandandandc. - G. The Abbe Guenee, in his
Lettres de quelques Juifs a Mons. de Voltaire, has exhausted the subject
of the fertility of Palestine; for Voltaire had likewise indulged in
sarcasm on this subject. Gibbon was assailed on this point, not, indeed,
by Mr. Davis, who, he slyly insinuates,was prevented by his patriotism
as a Welshman from resenting the comparison with Wales, but by other
writers. In his Vindication, he first established the correctness of his
measurement of Palestine, which he estimates as 7600 square English
miles, while Wales is about 7011. As to fertility, he proceeds in the
following dexterously composed and splendid passage: “The emperor
Frederick II., the enemy and the victim of the clergy, is accused of
saying, after his return from his crusade, that the God of the Jews
would have despised his promised land, if he had once seen the fruitful
realms of Sicily and Naples.“ (See Giannone, Istor. Civ. del R. di
Napoli, ii. 245.) This raillery, which malice has, perhaps, falsely
imputed to Frederick, is inconsistent with truth and piety; yet it must
be confessed that the soil of Palestine does not contain that
inexhaustible, and, as it were, spontaneous principle of fertility,
which, under the most unfavorable circumstances, has covered with rich
harvests the banks of the Nile, the fields of Sicily, or the plains of
Poland. The Jordan is the only navigable river of Palestine: a
considerable part of the narrow space is occupied, or rather lost, in
the Dead Sea whose horrid aspect inspires every sensation of disgust,
and countenances every tale of horror. The districts which border on
Arabia partake of the sandy quality of the adjacent desert. The face of
the country, except the sea- coast, and the valley of the Jordan, is
covered with mountains, which appear, for the most part, as naked and
barren rocks; and in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, there is a real
scarcity of the two elements of earth and water. (See Maundrel’s
Travels, p. 65, and Reland’s Palestin. i. 238, 395.) These
disadvantages, which now operate in their fullest extent, were formerly
corrected by the labors of a numerous people, and the active protection
of a wise government. The hills were clothed with rich beds of
artificial mould, the rain was collected in vast cisterns, a supply of
fresh water was conveyed by pipes and aqueducts to the dry lands. The
breed of cattle was encouraged in those parts which were not adapted for
tillage, and almost every spot was compelled to yield some production
for the use of the inhabitants.</p></li>
<li><p>: The French editor has a long and unnecessary note on the
History of Cyrene. For the present state of that coast and country, the
volume of Captain Beechey is full of interesting details. Egypt, now an
independent and improving kingdom, appears, under the enterprising rule
of Mahommed Ali, likely to revenge its former oppression upon the
decrepit power of the Turkish empire. - M. - This note was written in
1838. The future destiny of Egypt is an important problem, only to be
solved by time. This observation will also apply to the new French
colony in Algiers. - M. 1845.]</p></li>
<li><p>It is easier to deplore the fate, than to describe the actual
condition, of Corsica. ^! Two Italian sovereigns assume a regal title
from Sardinia and Sicily. Crete, or Candia, with Cyprus, and most of the
smaller islands of Greece and Asia, have been subdued by the Turkish
arms, whilst the little rock of Malta defies their power, and has
emerged, under the government of its military Order, into fame and
opulence. ^!!</p></li>

<li><p>The Egyptian superstition, of all the most contemptible and
abject, was frequently prohibited: the temples of Serapis and Isis
demolished, and their worshippers banished from Rome and Italy. ^15 But
the zeal of fanaticism prevailed over the cold and feeble efforts of
policy. The exiles returned, the proselytes multiplied, the temples were
restored with increasing splendor, and Isis and Serapis at length
assumed their place among the Roman Deities. ^16 Nor was this indulgence
a departure from the old maxims of government. In the purest ages of the
commonwealth, Cybele and Aesculapius had been invited by solemn
embassies; ^17 and it was customary to tempt the protectors of besieged
cities, by the promise of more distinguished honors than they possessed
in their native country. ^18 Rome gradually became the common temple of
her subjects; and the freedom of the city was bestowed on all the gods
of mankind. ^19</p></li>
<li><p>: Yet the worship of foreign gods at Rome was only guarantied to
the natives of those countries from whence they came. The Romans
administered the priestly offices only to the gods of their fathers.
Gibbon, throughout the whole preceding sketch of the opinions of the
Romans and their subjects, has shown through what causes they were free
from religious hatred and its consequences. But, on the other hand the
internal state of these religions, the infidelity and hypocrisy of the
upper orders, the indifference towards all religion, in even the better
part of the common people, during the last days of the republic, and
under the Caesars, and the corrupting principles of the philosophers,
had exercised a very pernicious influence on the manners, and even on
the constitution. - W.]</p></li>

<ol start="18" type="1">
<li><p>were intrusted, under the immediate eye of the supreme power,
with the execution of the laws. From the foot of the Alps to the
extremity of Calabria, all the natives of Italy were born citizens of
Rome. Their partial distinctions were obliterated, and they insensibly
coalesced into one great nation, united by language, manners, and civil
institutions, and equal to the weight of a powerful empire. The republic
gloried in her generous policy, and was frequently rewarded by the merit
and services of her adopted sons. Had she always confined the
distinction of Romans to the ancient families within the walls of the
city, that immortal name would have been deprived of some of its noblest
ornaments. Virgil was a native of Mantua; Horace was inclined to doubt
whether he should call himself an Apulian or a Lucanian; it was in Padua
that an historian was found worthy to record the majestic series of
Roman victories. The patriot family of the Catos emerged from Tusculum;
and the little town of Arpinum claimed the double honor of producing
Marius and Cicero, the former of whom deserved, after Romulus and
Camillus, to be styled the Third Founder of Rome; and the latter, after
saving his country from the designs of Catiline, enabled her to contend
with Athens for the palm of eloquence. ^27</p></li>
<li><p>: It may be doubted whether the municipal government of the
cities was not the old Italian constitution rather than a transcript
from that of Rome. The free government of the cities, observes Savigny,
was the leading characteristic of Italy. Geschichte des Romischen
Rechts, i. p. G. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>conferred on the cities to which it had been granted, a more
partial favor. The magistrates only, at the expiration of their office,
assumed the quality of Roman citizens; but as those offices were annual,
in a few years they circulated round the principal families. ^34 Those
of the provincials who were permitted to bear arms in the legions; ^35
those who exercised any civil employment; all, in a word, who performed
any public service, or displayed any personal talents, were rewarded
with a present, whose value was continually diminished by the increasing
liberality of the emperors. Yet even, in the age of the Antonines, when
the freedom of the city had been bestowed on the greater number of their
subjects, it was still accompanied with very solid advantages. The bulk
of the people acquired, with that title, the benefit of the Roman laws,
particularly in the interesting articles of marriage, testaments, and
inheritances; and the road of fortune was open to those whose
pretensions were seconded by favor or merit. The grandsons of the Gauls,
who had besieged Julius Caesar in Alcsia, commanded legions, governed
provinces, and were admitted into the senate of Rome. ^36 Their
ambition, instead of disturbing the tranquillity of the state, was
intimately connected with its safety and greatness.</p></li>

<li><p>taken in thousands by the chance of war, purchased at a vile
price, ^46 accustomed to a life of independence, and impatient to break
and to revenge their fetters. Against such internal enemies, whose
desperate insurrections had more than once reduced the republic to the
brink of destruction, ^47 the most severe ^</p></li>
<li><p>In their numerous families, and particularly in their country
estates, they encouraged the marriage of their slaves. ^! The sentiments
of nature, the habits of education, and the possession of a dependent
species of property, contributed to alleviate the hardships of
servitude. ^49 The existence of a slave became an object of greater
value, and though his happiness still depended on the temper and
circumstances of the master, the humanity of the latter, instead of
being restrained by fear, was encouraged by the sense of his own
interest. The progress of manners was accelerated by the virtue or
policy of the emperors; and by the edicts of Hadrian and the Antonines,
the protection of the laws was extended to the most abject part of
mankind. The jurisdiction of life and death over the slaves, a power
long exercised and often abused, was taken out of private hands, and
reserved to the magistrates alone. The subterraneous prisons were
abolished; and, upon a just complaint of intolerable treatment, the
injured slave obtained either his deliverance, or a less cruel master.
^50</p></li>
<li><p>: It was this which rendered the wars so sanguinary, and the
battles so obstinate. The immortal Robertson, in an excellent discourse
on the state of the world at the period of the establishment of
Christianity, has traced a picture of the melancholy effects of slavery,
in which we find all the depth of his views and the strength of his
mind. I shall oppose successively some passages to the reflections of
Gibbon. The reader will see, not without interest, the truths which
Gibbon appears to have mistaken or voluntarily neglected, developed by
one of the best of modern historians. It is important to call them to
mind here, in order to establish the facts and their consequences with
accuracy. I shall more than once have occasion to employ, for this
purpose, the discourse of Robertson.</p></li>
<li><p>: The following is the example: we shall see whether the word
“severe“ is here in its place. “At the time in which L. Domitius was
praetor in Sicily, a slave killed a wild boar of extraordinary size. The
praetor, struck by the dexterity and courage of the man, desired to see
him. The poor wretch, highly gratified with the distinction, came to
present himself before the praetor, in hopes, no doubt, of praise and
reward; but Domitius, on learning that he had only a javelin to attack
and kill the boar, ordered him to be instantly crucified, under the
barbarous pretext that the law prohibited the use of this weapon, as of
all others, to slaves.“ Perhaps the cruelty of Domitius is less
astonishing than the indifference with which the Roman orator relates
this circumstance, which affects him so little that he thus expresses
himself: “Durum hoc fortasse videatur, neque ego in ullam partem
disputo.“ “This may appear harsh, nor do I give any opinion on the
subject.“ And it is the same orator who exclaims in the same oration,
“Facinus est cruciare civem Romanum; scelus verberare; prope parricidium
necare: quid dicam in crucem tollere?“ “It is a crime to imprison a
Roman citizen; wickedness to scourge; next to parricide to put to death,
what shall I call it to crucify?“</p></li>
<li><p>It is not the authority of any single detached precept in the
gospel, but the spirit and genius of the Christian religion, more
powerful than any particular command. which hath abolished the practice
of slavery throughout the world. The temper which Christianity inspired
was mild and gentle; and the doctrines it taught added such dignity and
lustre to human nature, as rescued it from the dishonorable servitude
into which it was sunk.“</p></li>
<li><p>the sentiments of nature, the habits of education, contributed to
alleviate the hardships of servitude.“ The children of slaves were the
property of their master, who could dispose of or alienate them like the
rest of his property. Is it in such a situation, with such notions, that
the sentiments of nature unfold themselves, or habits of education
become mild and peaceful? We must not attribute to causes inadequate or
altogether without force, effects which require to explain them a
reference to more influential causes; and even if these slighter causes
had in effect a manifest influence, we must not forget that they are
themselves the effect of a primary, a higher, and more extensive cause,
which, in giving to the mind and to the character a more disinterested
and more humane bias, disposed men to second or themselves to advance,
by their conduct, and by the change of manners, the happy results which
it tended to produce. - G.</p></li>
<li><p>: An active slave-trade, which was carried on in many quarters,
particularly the Euxine, the eastern provinces, the coast of Africa, and
British must be taken into the account. Blair, 23 - 32. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>The total amount of this imperfect calculation would rise to
about one hundred and twenty millions of persons; a degree of population
which possibly exceeds that of modern Europe, ^62 and forms the most
numerous society that has ever been united under the same system of
government.</p></li>
<li><p>: According to Robertson, there were twice as many slaves as free
citizens. - G. Mr. Blair (p. 15) estimates three slaves to one freeman,
between the conquest of Greece, B.C. 146, and the reign of Alexander
Severus, A. D. 222, 235. The proportion was probably larger in Italy
than in the provinces. - M. On the other hand, Zumpt, in his
Dissertation quoted below, (p. 86,) asserts it to be a gross error in
Gibbon to reckon the number of slaves equal to that of the free
population. The luxury and magnificence of the great, (he observes,) at
the commencement of the empire, must not be taken as the groundwork of
calculations for the whole Roman world. The agricultural laborer, and
the artisan, in Spain, Gaul, Britain, Syria, and Egypt, maintained
himself, as in the present day, by his own labor and that of his
household, without possessing a single slave.“ The latter part of my
note was intended to suggest this consideration. Yet so completely was
slavery rooted in the social system, both in the east and the west, that
in the great diffusion of wealth at this time, every one, I doubt not,
who could afford a domestic slave, kept one; and generally, the number
of slaves was in proportion to the wealth. I do not believe that the
cultivation of the soil by slaves was confined to Italy; the holders of
large estates in the provinces would probably, either from choice or
necessity, adopt the same mode of cultivation. The latifundia, says
Pliny, had ruined Italy, and had begun to ruin the provinces. Slaves
were no doubt employed in agricultural labor to a great extent in
Sicily, and were the estates of those six enormous landholders who were
said to have possessed the whole province of Africa, cultivated
altogether by free coloni? Whatever may have been the case in the rural
districts, in the towns and cities the household duties were almost
entirely discharged by slaves, and vast numbers belonged to the public
establishments. I do not, however, differ so far from Zumpt, and from M.
Dureau de la Malle, as to adopt the higher and bolder estimate of
Robertson and Mr. Blair, rather than the more cautious suggestions of
Gibbon. I would reduce rather than increase the proportion of the slave
population. The very ingenious and elaborate calculations of the French
writer, by which he deduces the amount of the population from the
produce and consumption of corn in Italy, appear to me neither precise
nor satisfactory bases for such complicated political
arithmetic.</p></li>

<li><p>designed by Pericles for musical performances, and the rehearsal
of new tragedies, had been a trophy of the victory of the arts over
barbaric greatness; as the timbers employed in the construction
consisted chiefly of the masts of the Persian vessels. Notwithstanding
the repairs bestowed on that ancient edifice by a king of Cappadocia, it
was again fallen to decay. Herod restored its ancient beauty and
magnificence. Nor was the liberality of that illustrious citizen
confined to the walls of Athens. The most splendid ornaments bestowed on
the temple of Neptune in the Isthmus, a theatre at Corinth, a stadium at
Delphi, a bath at Thermopylae, and an aqueduct at Canusium in Italy,
were insufficient to exhaust his treasures. The people of Epirus,

<li><p>At a small distance from thence was situated the Forum of Trajan.
It was surrounded by a lofty portico, in the form of a quadrangle, into
which four triumphal arches opened a noble and spacious entrance: in the
centre arose a column of marble, whose height, of one hundred and ten
feet, denoted the elevation of the hill that had been cut away. This
column, which still subsists in its ancient beauty, exhibited an exact
representation of the Dacian victories of its founder. The veteran
soldier contemplated the story of his own campaigns, and by an easy
illusion of national vanity, the peaceful citizen associated himself to
the honors of the triumph. All the other quarters of the capital, and
all the provinces of the empire, were embellished by the same liberal
spirit of public magnificence, and were filled with amphi theatres,
theatres, temples, porticoes, triumphal arches, baths and aqueducts, all
variously conducive to the health, the devotion, and the pleasures of
the meanest citizen. The last mentioned of those edifices deserve our
peculiar attention. The boldness of the enterprise, the solidity of the
execution, and the uses to which they were subservient, rank the
aqueducts among the noblest monuments of Roman genius and power. The
aqueducts of the capital claim a just preeminence; but the curious
traveller, who, without the light of history, should examine those of
Spoleto, of Metz, or of Segovia, would very naturally conclude that
those provincial towns had formerly been the residence of some potent
monarch. The solitudes of Asia and Africa were once covered with
flourishing cities, whose populousness, and even whose existence, was
derived from such artificial supplies of a perennial stream of fresh
water. ^73</p></li>
<li><p>: The Emperor Vespasian, who had caused the Temple of Peace to be
built, transported to it the greatest part of the pictures, statues, and
other works of art which had escaped the civil tumults. It was there
that every day the artists and the learned of Rome assembled; and it is
on the site of this temple that a multitude of antiques have been dug
up. See notes of Reimar on Dion Cassius, lxvi. c. 15, p. 1083. -

<li><p>Those parts of Italy which have so long languished under the lazy
tyranny of priests and viceroys, had been afflicted only by the more
tolerable calamities of war; and the first symptoms of decay which they
experienced, were amply compensated by the rapid improvements of the
Cisalpine Gaul. The splendor of Verona may be traced in its remains: yet
Verona was less celebrated than Aquileia or Padua, Milan or Ravenna. II.
The spirit of improvement had passed the Alps, and been felt even in the
woods of Britain, which were gradually cleared away to open a free space
for convenient and elegant habitations. York was the seat of government;
London was already enriched by commerce; and Bath was celebrated for the
salutary effects of its medicinal waters. Gaul could boast of her twelve
hundred cities; ^75 and though, in the northern parts, many of them,
without excepting Paris itself, were little more than the rude and
imperfect townships of a rising people, the southern provinces imitated
the wealth and elegance of Italy. ^76 Many were the cities of Gaul,
Marseilles, Arles, Nismes, Narbonne, Thoulouse, Bourdeaux, Autun,
Vienna, Lyons, Langres, and Treves, whose ancient condition might
sustain an equal, and perhaps advantageous comparison with their present
state. With regard to Spain, that country flourished as a province, and
has declined as a kingdom. Exhausted by the abuse of her strength, by
America, and by superstition, her pride might possibly be confounded, if
we required such a list of three hundred and sixty cities, as Pliny has
exhibited under the reign of Vespasian. ^77 III. Three hundred African
cities had once acknowledged the authority of Carthage, ^78 nor is it
likely that their numbers diminished under the administration of the
emperors: Carthage itself rose with new splendor from its ashes; and
that capital, as well as Capua and Corinth, soon recovered all the
advantages which can be separated from independent sovereignty. IV. The
provinces of the East present the contrast of Roman magnificence with
Turkish barbarism. The ruins of antiquity scattered over uncultivated
fields, and ascribed, by ignorance to the power of magic, scarcely
afford a shelter to the oppressed peasant or wandering Arab. Under the
reign of the Caesars, the proper Asia alone contained five hundred
populous cities, ^79 enriched with all the gifts of nature, and adorned
with all the refinements of art. Eleven cities of Asia had once disputed
the honor of dedicating a temple of Tiberius, and their respective
merits were examined by the senate. ^80 Four of them were immediately
rejected as unequal to the burden; and among these was Laodicea, whose
splendor is still displayed in its ruins. ^81 Laodicea collected a very
considerable revenue from its flocks of sheep, celebrated for the
fineness of their wool, and had received, a little before the contest, a
legacy of above four hundred thousand pounds by the testament of a
generous citizen. ^82 If such was the poverty of Laodicea, what must
have been the wealth of those cities, whose claim appeared preferable,
and particularly of Pergamus, of Smyrna, and of Ephesus, who so long
disputed with each other the titular primacy of Asia? ^83 The capitals
of Syria and Egypt held a still superior rank in the empire; Antioch and
Alexandria looked down with disdain on a crowd of dependent cities, ^84
and yielded, with reluctance, to the majesty of Rome itself.</p></li>
<li><p>: This may in some degree account for the difficulty started by
Livy, as to the incredibly numerous armies raised by the small states
around Rome where, in his time, a scanty stock of free soldiers among a

<li><p>The use of posts was allowed to those who claimed it by an
Imperial mandate; but though originally intended for the public service,
it was sometimes indulged to the business or conveniency of private
citizens. ^90 Nor was the communication of the Roman empire less free
and open by sea than it was by land. The provinces surrounded and
enclosed the Mediterranean: and Italy, in the shape of an immense
promontory, advanced into the midst of that great lake. The coasts of
Italy are, in general, destitute of safe harbors; but human industry had
corrected the deficiencies of nature; and the artificial port of Ostia,
in particular, situate at the mouth of the Tyber, and formed by the
emperor Claudius, was a useful monument of Roman greatness. ^91 From
this port, which was only sixteen miles from the capital, a favorable
breeze frequently carried vessels in seven days to the columns of
Hercules, and in nine or ten, to Alexandria in Egypt. ^92</p></li>

of the senate, that, in the purchase of female ornaments, the wealth of
the state was irrecoverably given away to foreign and hostile nations.
^106 The annual loss is computed, by a writer of an inquisitive but
censorious temper, at upwards of eight hundred thousand pounds sterling.
^107 Such was the style of discontent, brooding over the dark prospect
of approaching poverty. And yet, if we compare the proportion between
gold and silver, as it stood in the time of Pliny, and as it was fixed
in the reign of Constantine, we shall discover within that period a very
considerable increase. ^108 There is not the least reason to suppose
that gold was become more scarce; it is therefore evident that silver
was grown more common; that whatever might be the amount of the Indian
and Arabian exports, they were far from exhausting the wealth of the
Roman world; and that the produce of the mines abundantly supplied the
demands of commerce.</p></li>

with regard to foreign productions. Arrian has a long list of European

that Gibbon has confined the use of aromatics to religious worship and

which had always been bestowed, by the censors, on the citizen the most
eminent for his honors and services. ^3 But whilst he thus restored the
dignity, he destroyed the independence, of the senate. The principles of
a free constitution are irrecoverably lost, when the legislative power
is nominated by the executive.</p></li>
<li><p>: Of these Dion and Suetonius knew nothing. - W. Dion says the
contrary. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>A law was passed, that wherever the emperor was present, his
extraordinary commission should supersede the ordinary jurisdiction of
the governor; a custom was introduced, that the new conquests belonged
to the imperial portion; and it was soon discovered that the authority
of the Prtnce, the favorite epithet of Augustus, was the same in every
part of the empire.</p></li>
<li><p>: This distinction is without foundation. The lieutenants of the
emperor, who were called Propraetors, whether they had been praetors or
consuls, were attended by six lictors; those who had the right of the
sword, (of life and death over the soldiers. - M.) bore the military
habit (paludamentum) and the sword. The provincial governors
commissioned by the senate, who, whether they had been consuls or not,
were called Pronconsuls, had twelve lictors when they had been consuls,
and six only when they had but been praetors. The provinces of Africa
and Asia were only given to ex- consuls. See, on the Organization of the
Provinces, Dion, liii. 12, 16 Strabo, xvii 840.- W]</p></li>
<li><p>But when the consular and tribunitian powers were united, when
they were vested for life in a single person, when the general of the
army was, at the same time, the minister of the senate and the
representative of the Roman people, it was impossible to resist the
exercise, nor was it easy to define the limits, of his imperial
prerogative.</p></li>
<li><p>: The note of M. Guizot on the tribunitian power applies to the
French translation rather than to the original. The former has,
maintenir la balance toujours egale, which implies much more than
Gibbon’s general expression. The note belongs rather to the history of
the Republic than that of the Empire. - M]</p></li>
<li><p>It was easily transferred from the kings to the governors of
Asia; and the Roman magistrates very frequently were adored as
provincial deities, with the pomp of altars and temples, of festivals
and sacrifices. ^22 It was natural that the emperors should not refuse
what the proconsuls had accepted; and the divine honors which both the
one and the other received from the provinces, attested rather the
despotism than the servitude of Rome. But the conquerors soon imitated
the vanquished nations in the arts of flattery; and the imperious spirit
of the first Caesar too easily consented to assume, during his lifetime,
a place among the tutelar deities of Rome. The milder temper of his
successor declined so dangerous an ambition, which was never afterwards
revived, except by the madness of Caligula and Domitian. Augustus
permitted indeed some of the provincial cities to erect temples to his
honor, on condition that they should associate the worship of Rome with
that of the sovereign; he tolerated private superstition, of which he
might be the object; ^23 but he contented himself with being revered by
the senate and the people in his human character, and wisely left to his
successor the care of his public deification. A regular custom was
introduced, that on the decease of every emperor who had neither lived
nor died like a tyrant, the senate by a solemn decree should place him
in the number of the gods: and the ceremonies of his apotheosis were
blended with those of his funeral. ^! This legal, and, as it should
seem, injudicious profanation, so abhorrent to our stricter principles,
was received with a very faint murmur, ^24 by the easy nature of
Polytheism; but it was received as an institution, not of religion, but
of policy. We should disgrace the virtues of the Antonines by comparing
them with the vices of Hercules or Jupiter. Even the characters of
Caesar or Augustus were far superior to those of the popular deities.
But it was the misfortune of the former to live in an enlightened age,
and their actions were too faithfully recorded to admit of such a
mixture of fable and mystery, as the devotion of the vulgar requires. As
soon as their divinity was established by law, it sunk into oblivion,
without contributing either to their own fame, or to the dignity of
succeeding princes.</p></li>
<li><p>: This is inaccurate. The successors of Alexander were not the
first deified sovereigns; the Egyptians had deified and worshipped many
of their kings; the Olympus of the Greeks was peopled with divinities
who had reigned on earth; finally, Romulus himself had received the
honors of an apotheosis (Tit. Liv. i. 16) a long time before Alexander
and his successors. It is also an inaccuracy to confound the honors
offered in the provinces to the Roman governors, by temples and altars,
with the true apotheosis of the emperors; it was not a religious
worship, for it had neither priests nor sacrifices. Augustus was
severely blamed for having permitted himself to be worshipped as a god
in the provinces, (Tac. Ann. i. 10: ) he would not have incurred that
blame if he had only done what the governors were accustomed to do. - G.
from W. M. Guizot has been guilty of a still greater inaccuracy in
confounding the deification of the living with the apotheosis of the
dead emperors. The nature of the king-worship of Egypt is still very
obscure; the hero-worship of the Greeks very different from the
adoration of the “praesens numen“ in the reigning sovereign. -
M.]</p></li>
<li><p>: The princes who by their birth or their adoption belonged to
the family of the Caesars, took the name of Caesar. After the death of
Nero, this name designated the Imperial dignity itself, and afterwards
the appointed successor. The time at which it was employed in the latter
sense, cannot be fixed with certainty. Bach (Hist. Jurisprud. Rom. 304)
affirms from Tacitus, H. i. 15, and Suetonius, Galba, 17, that Galba
conferred on Piso Lucinianus the title of Caesar, and from that time the
term had this meaning: but these two historians simply say that he
appointed Piso his successor, and do not mention the word Caesar.
Aurelius Victor (in Traj. 348, ed. Artzen) says that Hadrian first
received this title on his adoption; but as the adoption of Hadrian is
still doubtful, and besides this, as Trajan, on his death-bed, was not
likely to have created a new title for his successor, it is more
probable that Aelius Verus was the first who was called Caesar when
adopted by Hadrian. Spart. in Aelio Vero, 102.- W.]</p></li>

contending armies. Excepting only this short, though violent eruption of
military license, the two centuries from Augustus ^29 to Commodus passed

emperor was elected by the authority of the senate, and the consent of

had won the victory. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>: There is no contradiction between the relation of Dion and that
of Spartianus and the modern Greeks. Dion does not say that Severus
destroyed Byzantium, but that he deprived it of its franchises and
privileges, stripped the inhabitants of their property, razed the
fortifications, and subjected the city to the jurisdiction of Perinthus.
Therefore, when Spartian, Suidas, Cedrenus, say that Severus and his son
Antoninus restored to Byzantium its rights and franchises, ordered
temples to be built, andandandandc., this is easily reconciled with the
relation of Dion. Perhaps the latter mentioned it in some of the
fragments of his history which have been lost. As to Herodian, his
expressions are evidently exaggerated, and he has been guilty of so many
inaccuracies in the history of Severus, that we have a right to suppose
one in this passage. - G. from W Wenck and M. Guizot have omitted to
cite Zosimus, who mentions a particular portico built by Severus, and
called, apparently, by his name. Zosim. Hist. ii. c. xxx. p. 151, 153,

<li><p>and the noblest provincials of Spain and Gaul were involved in
the same ruin. ^! Such rigid justice - for so he termed it - was, in the
opinion of Severus, the only conduct capable of insuring peace to the
people or stability to the prince; and he condescended slightly to
lament, that to be mild, it was necessary that he should first be cruel.

<li><p>: Wenck denies that there is any authority for this massacre of
the wives of the senators. He adds, that only the children and relatives
of Niger and Albinus were put to death. This is true of the family of
Albinus, whose bodies were thrown into the Rhone; those of Niger,
according to Lampridius, were sent into exile, but afterwards put to
death. Among the partisans of Albinus who were put to death were many

general corruption might be ascribed, not indeed to the example, but to
the pernicious indulgence, however, of the commander-in-chief.</p></li>

<li><p>was placed not only at the head of the army, but of the finances,
and even of the law. In every department of administration, he
represented the person, and exercised the authority, of the emperor. The
first praefect who enjoyed and abused this immense power was Plautianus,
the favorite minister of Severus. His reign lasted above then years,
till the marriage of his daughter with the eldest son of the emperor,
which seemed to assure his fortune, proved the occasion of his ruin. ^68
The animosities of the palace, by irritating the ambition and alarming
the fears of Plautianus, ^</p></li>
<li><p>: The Praetorian Praefect had never been a simple captain of the
guards; from the first creation of this office, under Augustus, it
possessed great power. That emperor, therefore, decreed that there
should be always two Praetorian Praefects, who could only be taken from
the equestrian order Tiberius first departed from the former clause of
this edict; Alexander Severus violated the second by naming senators
praefects. It appears that it was under Commodus that the Praetorian
Praefects obtained the province of civil jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li><p>: Plautianus was compatriot, relative, and the old friend, of
Severus; he had so completely shut up all access to the emperor, that
the latter was ignorant how far he abused his powers: at length, being
informed of it, he began to limit his authority. The marriage of
Plautilla with Caracalla was unfortunate; and the prince who had been
forced to consent to it, menaced the father and the daughter with death
when he should come to the throne. It was feared, after that, that
Plautianus would avail himself of the power which he still possessed,
against the Imperial family; and Severus caused him to be assassinated
in his presence, upon the pretext of a conspiracy, which Dion considers
fictitious. - W. This note is not, perhaps, very necessary and does not
contain the whole facts. Dion considers the conspiracy the invention of
Caracalla, by whose command, almost by whose hand, Plautianus was slain
in the presence of Severus. - M.]</p></li>

<li><p>but as Caracalla wished to assuage the first emotions of public
indignation, the name of Geta was mentioned with decency, and he
received the funeral honors of a Roman emperor. ^24 Posterity, in pity
to his misfortune, has cast a veil over his vices. We consider that
young prince as the innocent victim of his brother’s ambition, without
recollecting that he himself wanted power, rather than inclination, to
consummate the same attempts of revenge and murder. ^!</p></li>
<li><p>: The account of this transaction, in a new passage of Dion,
varies in some degree from this statement. It adds that the next
morning, in the senate, Antoninus requested their indulgence, not
because he had killed his brother, but because he was hoarse, and could
not address them. Mai. Fragm. p. 228. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>and even the afflicted Julia was obliged to silence her
lamentations, to suppress her sighs, and to receive the assassin with
smiles of joy and approbation. It was computed that, under the vague
appellation of the friends of Geta, above twenty thousand persons of
both sexes suffered death. His guards and freedmen, the ministers of his
serious business, and the companions of his looser hours, those who by
his interest had been promoted to any commands in the army or provinces,
with the long connected chain of their dependants, were included in the
proscription; which endeavored to reach every one who had maintained the
smallest correspondence with Geta, who lamented his death, or who even
mentioned his name. ^26 Helvius Pertinax, son to the prince of that
name, lost his life by an unseasonable witticism. ^27 It was a
sufficient crime of Thrasea Priscus to be descended from a family in
which the love of liberty seemed an hereditary quality. ^28 The
particular causes of calumny and suspicion were at length exhausted; and
when a senator was accused of being a secret enemy to the government,
the emperor was satisfied with the general proof that he was a man of
property and virtue. From this well-grounded principle he frequently
drew the most bloody inferences. ^!</p></li>
<li><p>: The most valuable paragraph of dion, which the industry of M.
Manas recovered, relates to this daughter of Marcus, executed by
Caracalla. Her name, as appears from Fronto, as well as from Dion, was
Cornificia. When commanded to choose the kind of death she was to
suffer, she burst into womanish tears; but remembering her father
Marcus, she thus spoke: - “O my hapless soul, (… animula,) now
imprisoned in the body, burst forth! be free! show them, however
reluctant to believe it, that thou art the daughter of Marcus.“ She then
laid aside all her ornaments, and preparing herself for death, ordered
her veins to be opened. Mai. Fragm. Vatican ii p. 220. - M.]</p></li>

<li><p>He was attended by a body of cavalry: but having stopped on the
road for some necessary occasion, his guards preserved a respectful
distance, and Martialis, approaching his person under a presence of
duty, stabbed him with a dagger. The bold assassin was instantly killed
by a Scythian archer of the Imperial guard. Such was the end of a
monster whose life disgraced human nature, and whose reign accused the
patience of the Romans. ^39 The grateful soldiers forgot his vices,
remembered only his partial liberality, and obliged the senate to
prostitute their own dignity and that of religion, by granting him a
place among the gods. Whilst he was upon earth, Alexander the Great was
the only hero whom this god deemed worthy his admiration. He assumed the
name and ensigns of Alexander, formed a Macedonian phalanx of guards,
persecuted the disciples of Aristotle, and displayed, with a puerile
enthusiasm, the only sentiment by which he discovered any regard for
virtue or glory. We can easily conceive, that after the battle of Narva,
and the conquest of Poland, Charles XII. (though he still wanted the
more elegant accomplishments of the son of Philip) might boast of having
rivalled his valor and magnanimity; but in no one action of his life did
Caracalla express the faintest resemblance of the Macedonian hero,

<li><p>Julia Maesa, her sister, was ordered to leave the court and
Antioch. She retired to Emesa with an immense fortune, the fruit of
twenty years’ favor accompanied by her two daughters, Soaemias and
Mamae, each of whom was a widow, and each had an only son. Bassianus, ^!
for that was the name of the son of Soaemias, was consecrated to the
honorable ministry of high priest of the Sun; and this holy vocation,
embraced either from prudence or superstition, contributed to raise the
Syrian youth to the empire of Rome. A numerous body of troops was
stationed at Emesa; and as the severe discipline of Macrinus had
constrained them to pass the winter encamped, they were eager to revenge
the cruelty of such unaccustomed hardships. The soldiers, who resorted
in crowds to the temple of the Sun, beheld with veneration and delight
the elegant dress and figure of the young pontiff; they recognized, or
they thought that they recognized, the features of Caracalla, whose
memory they now adored. The artful Maesa saw and cherished their rising
partiality, and readily sacrificing her daughter’s reputation to the
fortune of her grandson, she insinuated that Bassianus was the natural
son of their murdered sovereign. The sums distributed by her emissaries
with a lavish hand silenced every objection, and the profusion
sufficiently proved the affinity, or at least the resemblance, of
Bassianus with the great original. The young Antoninus (for he had
assumed and polluted that respectable name) was declared emperor by the
troops of Emesa, asserted his hereditary right, and called aloud on the
armies to follow the standard of a young and liberal prince, who had
taken up arms to revenge his father’s death and the oppression of the
military order. ^47</p></li>
<li><p>: As soon as this princess heard of the death of Caracalla, she
wished to starve herself to death: the respect shown to her by Macrinus,
in making no change in her attendants or her court, induced her to
prolong her life. But it appears, as far as the mutilated text of Dion
and the imperfect epitome of Xiphilin permit us to judge, that she
conceived projects of ambition, and endeavored to raise herself to the
empire. She wished to tread in the steps of Semiramis and Nitocris,
whose country bordered on her own. Macrinus sent her an order
immediately to leave Antioch, and to retire wherever she chose. She
returned to her former purpose, and starved herself to death. -

might have obtained the victory, had he not betrayed his own cause by a
shameful and precipitate flight. His cowardice served only to protract
his life a few days, and to stamp deserved ignominy on his misfortunes.
It is scarcely necessary to add, that his son Diadumenianus was involved
in the same fate.</p></li>

<li><p>but the corrupt and opulent nobles of Rome gratified every vice
that could be collected from the mighty conflux of nations and manners.
Secure of impunity, careless of censure, they lived without restraint in
the patient and humble society of their slaves and parasites. The
emperor, in his turn, viewing every rank of his subjects with the same
contemptuous indifference, asserted without control his sovereign
privilege of lust and luxury.</p></li>
<li><p>: Wenck has justly observed that Gibbon should have reckoned the
influence of Christianity in this great change. In the most savage
times, and the most corrupt courts, since the introduction of
Christianity there have been no Neros or Domitians, no Commodus or
Elagabalus. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>: Alexander received into his chapel all the religions which
prevailed in the empire; he admitted Jesus Christ, Abraham, Orpheus,
Apollonius of Tyana, andandandandc. It was almost certain that his
mother Mamaea had instructed him in the morality of Christianity.
Historians in general agree in calling her a Christian; there is reason
to believe that she had begun to have a taste for the principles of
Christianity. (See Tillemont, Alexander Severus) Gibbon has not noticed
this circumstance; he appears to have wished to lower the character of
this empress; he has throughout followed the narrative of Herodian, who,
by the acknowledgment of Capitolinus himself, detested Alexander.
Without believing the exaggerated praises of Lampridius, he ought not to
have followed the unjust severity of Herodian, and, above all, not to
have forgotten to say that the virtuous Alexander Severus had insured to
the Jews the preservation of their privileges, and permitted the
exercise of Christianity. Hist. Aug. p. 121. The Christians had
established their worship in a public place, of which the victuallers
(cauponarii) claimed, not the property, but possession by custom.
Alexander answered, that it was better that the place should be used for
the service of God, in any form, than for victuallers. - G. I have
scrupled to omit this note, as it contains some points worthy of notice;
but it is very unjust to Gibbon, who mentions almost all the
circumstances, which he is accused of omitting, in another, and,
according to his plan, a better place, and, perhaps, in stronger terms
than M. Guizot. See Chap. xvi. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>The provinces, relieved from the oppressive taxes invented by
Caracalla and his pretended son, flourished in peace and prosperity,
under the administration of magistrates, who were convinced by
experience that to deserve the love of the subjects, was their best and
only method of obtaining the favor of their sovereign. While some gentle
restraints were imposed on the innocent luxury of the Roman people, the
price of provisions and the interest of money, were reduced by the
paternal care of Alexander, whose prudent liberality, without
distressing the industrious, supplied the wants and amusements of the
populace. The dignity, the freedom, the authority of the senate was
restored; and every virtuous senator might approach the person of the
emperor without a fear and without a blush.</p></li>
<li><p>: Wenck observes that Gibbon, enchanted with the virtue of
Alexander has heightened, particularly in this sentence, its effect on
the state of the world. His own account, which follows, of the
insurrections and foreign wars, is not in harmony with this beautiful
picture. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>Such was the deplorable weakness of government, that the emperor
was unable to revenge his murdered friend and his insulted dignity,
without stooping to the arts of patience and dissimulation. Epagathus,
the principal leader of the mutiny, was removed from Rome, by the
honorable employment of praefect of Egypt: from that high rank he was
gently degraded to the government of Crete; and when at length, his
popularity among the guards was effaced by time and absence, Alexander
ventured to inflict the tardy but deserved punishment of his crimes. ^74
Under the reign of a just and virtuous prince, the tyranny of the army
threatened with instant death his most faithful ministers, who were
suspected of an intention to correct their intolerable disorders. The
historian Dion Cassius had commanded the Pannonian legions with the
spirit of ancient discipline. Their brethren of Rome, embracing the
common cause of military license, demanded the head of the reformer.
Alexander, however, instead of yielding to their seditious clamors,
showed a just sense of his merit and services, by appointing him his
colleague in the consulship, and defraying from his own treasury the
expense of that vain dignity: but as was justly apprehended, that if the
soldiers beheld him with the ensigns of his office, they would revenge
the insult in his blood, the nominal first magistrate of the state
retired, by the emperor’s advice, from the city, and spent the greatest
part of his consulship at his villas in Campania. ^75 ^</p></li>
<li><p>: Gibbon has confounded two events altogether different - the
quarrel of the people with the Praetorians, which lasted three days, and
the assassination of Ulpian by the latter. Dion relates first the death
of Ulpian, afterwards, reverting back according to a manner which is
usual with him, he says that during the life of Ulpian, there had been a
war of three days between the Praetorians and the people. But Ulpian was
not the cause. Dion says, on the contrary, that it was occasioned by
some unimportant circumstance; whilst he assigns a weighty reason for
the murder of Ulpian, the judgment by which that Praetorian praefect had
condemned his predecessors, Chrestus and Flavian, to death, whom the
soldiers wished to revenge. Zosimus (l. 1, c. xi.) attributes this
sentence to Mamaera; but, even then, the troops might have imputed it to
Ulpian, who had reaped all the advantage and was otherwise odious to
them. - W.]</p></li>
<li><p>: Dion possessed no estates in Campania, and was not rich. He
only says that the emperor advised him to reside, during his consulate,
in some place out of Rome; that he returned to Rome after the end of his
consulate, and had an interview with the emperor in Campania. He asked
and obtained leave to pass the rest of his life in his native city,
(Nice, in Bithynia: ) it was there that he finished his history, which
closes with his second consulship. - W.]</p></li>

<li><p>: Historians are divided as to the success of the campaign
against the Persians; Herodian alone speaks of defeat. Lampridius,
Eutropius, Victor, and others, say that it was very glorious to
Alexander; that he beat Artaxerxes in a great battle, and repelled him
from the frontiers of the empire. This much is certain, that Alexander,
on his return to Rome, (Lamp. Hist. Aug. c. 56, 133, 134,) received the
honors of a triumph, and that he said, in his oration to the people.
Quirites, vicimus Persas, milites divites reduximus, vobis congiarium
pollicemur, cras ludos circenses Persicos donabimus. Alexander, says
Eckhel, had too much modesty and wisdom to permit himself to receive
honors which ought only to be the reward of victory, if he had not
deserved them; he would have contented himself with dissembling his
losses. Eckhel, Doct. Num. vet. vii. 276. The medals represent him as in

prince so accurately balanced the revenues and expenses of the Roman
empire. ^85 Deprived of this clear and comprehensive estimate, we are
reduced to collect a few imperfect hints from such of the ancients as
have accidentally turned aside from the splendid to the more useful
parts of history. We are informed that, by the conquests of Pompey, the
tributes of Asia were raised from fifty to one hundred and thirty-five
millions of drachms; or about four millions and a half sterling. ^86 ^!
Under the last and most indolent of the Ptolemies, the revenue of Egypt
is said to have amounted to twelve thousand five hundred talents; a sum
equivalent to more than two millions and a half of our money, but which
was afterwards considerably improved by the more exact economy of the
Romans, and the increase of the trade of Aethiopia and India. ^87 Gaul
was enriched by rapine, as Egypt was by commerce, and the tributes of
those two great provinces have been compared as nearly equal to each
other in value. ^88 The ten thousand Euboic or Phoenician talents, about
four millions sterling, ^89 which vanquished Carthage was condemned to
pay within the term of fifty years, were a slight acknowledgment of the
superiority of Rome, ^90 and cannot bear the least proportion with the
taxes afterwards raised both on the lands and on the persons of the
inhabitants, when the fertile coast of Africa was reduced into a
province. ^91</p></li>
<li><p>: See Rationarium imperii. Compare besides Tacitus, Suet.

the Roman empire, but it is lost. - W.]</p></li>
<li><p>Mention is made of a mine near Carthagena which yielded every day
twenty-five thousand drachmns of silver, or about three hundred thousand
pounds a year. ^93 Twenty thousand pound weight of gold was annually
received from the provinces of Asturia, Gallicia, and Lusitania.

<li><p>: Compare Heeren’s Researches vol. i. part ii. p.]</p></li>
<li><p>Nor was the rapacious son of Severus contented with such a
measure of taxation as had appeared sufficient to his moderate
predecessors. Instead of a twentieth, he exacted a tenth of all legacies
and inheritances; and during his reign (for the ancient proportion was
restored after his death) he crushed alike every part of the empire
under the weight of his iron sceptre. ^114</p></li>
<li><p>: Gibbon has adopted the opinion of Spanheim and of Burman, which
attributes to Caracalla this edict, which gave the right of the city to
all the inhabitants of the provinces. This opinion may be disputed.
Several passages of Spartianus, of Aurelius Victor, and of Aristides,
attribute this edict to Marc. Aurelius. See a learned essay, entitled
Joh. P. Mahneri Comm. de Marc. Aur. Antonino Constitutionis de Civitate
Universo Orbi Romano data auctore. Halae, 1772, 8vo. It appears that
Marc. Aurelius made some modifications of this edict, which released the
provincials from some of the charges imposed by the right of the city,
and deprived them of some of the advantages which it conferred.
Caracalla annulled these modifications. - W.]</p></li>

miracles of the prophet. To suppress the idolaters, reunite the
schismatics, and confute the unbelievers, by the infallible decision of
a general council, the pious Artaxerxes summoned the Magi from all parts

obscurity obeyed the welcome summons; and, on the appointed day,
appeared, to the number of about eighty thousand. But as the debates of
so tumultuous an assembly could not have been directed by the authority
of reason, or influenced by the art of policy, the Persian synod was
reduced, by successive operations, to forty thousand, to four thousand,
to four hundred, to forty, and at last to seven Magi, the most respected

<li><p>The principle of good is eternally aborbed in light; the
principle of evil eternally buried in darkness. The wise benevolence of
Ormusd formed man capable of virtue, and abundantly provided his fair
habitation with the materials of happiness. By his vigilant providence,
the motion of the planets, the order of the seasons, and the temperate
mixture of the elements, are preserved. But the malice of Ahriman has
long since pierced Ormusd’s egg; or, in other words, has violated the
harmony of his works. Since that fatal eruption, the most minute
articles of good and evil are intimately intermingled and agitated
together; the rankest poisons spring up amidst the most salutary plants;
deluges, earthquakes, and conflagrations attest the conflict of Nature,
and the little world of man is perpetually shaken by vice and
misfortune. Whilst the rest of human kind are led away captives in the
chains of their infernal enemy, the faithful Persian alone reserves his
religious adoration for his friend and protector Ormusd, and fights
under his banner of light, in the full confidence that he shall, in the
last day, share the glory of his triumph. At that decisive period, the
enlightened wisdom of goodness will render the power of Ormusd superior
to the furious malice of his rival. Ahriman and his followers, disarmed
and subdued, will sink into their native darkness; and virtue will
maintain the eternal peace and harmony of the universe. ^11 ^!!</p></li>
<li><p>: This is an error. Ahriman was not forced by his invariable
nature to do evil; the Zendavesta expressly recognizes (see the
Izeschne) that he was born good, that in his origin he was light; envy
rendered him evil; he became jealous of the power and attributes of
Ormuzd; then light was changed into darkness, and Ahriman was
precipitated into the abyss. See the Abridgment of the Doctrine of the
Ancient Persians, by Anquetil, c. ii Section 2. - G.]</p></li>

<li><p>We may quote from the Zendavesta a wise and benevolent maxim,
which compensates for many an absurdity. “He who sows the ground with
care and diligence acquires a greater stock of religious merit than he
could gain by the repetition of ten thousand prayers.“ ^15 In the spring
of every year a festival was celebrated, destined to represent the
primitive equality, and the present connection, of mankind. The stately
kings of Persia, exchanging their vain pomp for more genuine greatness,
freely mingled with the humblest but most useful of their subjects. On
that day the husbandmen were admitted, without distinction, to the table
of the king and his satraps. The monarch accepted their petitions,
inquired into their grievances, and conversed with them on the most
equal terms. “From your labors,“ was he accustomed to say, (and to say
with truth, if not with sincerity,) “from your labors we receive our
subsistence; you derive your tranquillity from our vigilance: since,
therefore, we are mutually necessary to each other, let us live together
like brothers in concord and love.“ ^16 Such a festival must indeed have
degenerated, in a wealthy and despotic empire, into a theatrical
representation; but it was at least a comedy well worthy of a royal
audience, and which might sometimes imprint a salutary lesson on the
mind of a young prince.</p></li>

<li><p>: The passage quoted by Gibbon is not taken from the writings of
Zoroaster, but from the Sadder, a work, as has been before said, much
later than the books which form the Zendavesta. and written by a Magus
for popular use; what it contains, therefore, cannot be attributed to
Zoroaster. It is remarkable that Gibbon should fall into this error, for
Hyde himself does not ascribe the Sadder to Zoroaster; he remarks that
it is written inverse, while Zoroaster always wrote in prose. Hyde, i.
p. 27. Whatever may be the case as to the latter assertion, for which
there appears little foundation, it is unquestionable that the Sadder is
of much later date. The Abbe Foucher does not even believe it to be an
extract from the works of Zoroaster. See his Diss. before quoted. Mem.
de l’Acad. des Ins. t. xxvii. - G. Perhaps it is rash to speak of any
part of the Zendavesta as the writing of Zoroaster, though it may be a
genuine representation of his. As to the Sadder, Hyde (in Praef.)
considered it not above 200 years old. It is manifestly post-Mahometan.

served to strengthen the new monarchy, by uniting all the various

The Jews were held in honor by him, and their schools flourished during

their real persecution did not begin till the reigns of Yezdigerd and

<li><p>: Besides these battle songs, the Germans sang at their festival
banquets, (Tac. Ann. i. 65,) and around the bodies of their slain

against Attila, was honored by songs while he was borne from the field
of battle. Jornandes, c. 41. The same honor was paid to the remains of
Attila. Ibid. c. 49. According to some historians, the Germans had songs
also at their weddings; but this appears to me inconsistent with their
customs, in which marriage was no more than the purchase of a wife.
Besides, there is but one instance of this, that of the Gothic king,
Ataulph, who sang himself the nuptial hymn when he espoused Placidia,
sister of the emperors Arcadius and Honorius, (Olympiodor. p. 8.) But

neighboring tribes, ^78 provoked by their insolence, allured by the

arms, but in our sight, and for our entertainment. May the nations,
enemies of Rome, ever preserve this enmity to each other! We have now
attained the utmost verge of prosperity, ^79 and have nothing left to
demand of fortune, except the discord of the barbarians.“ ^80 - These
sentiments, less worthy of the humanity than of the patriotism of
Tacitus, express the invariable maxims of the policy of his countrymen.
They deemed it a much safer expedient to divide than to combat the
barbarians, from whose defeat they could derive neither honor nor
advantage. The money and negotiations of Rome insinuated themselves into
the heart of Germany; and every art of seduction was used with dignity,
to conciliate those nations whom their proximity to the Rhine or Danube
might render the most useful friends as well as the most troublesome
enemies. Chiefs of renown and power were flattered by the most trifling
presents, which they received either as marks of distinction, or as the
instruments of luxury. In civil dissensions the weaker faction
endeavored to strengthen its interest by entering into secret
connections with the governors of the frontier provinces. Every quarrel
among the Germans was fomented by the intrigues of Rome; and every plan
of union and public good was defeated by the stronger bias of private
jealousy and interest. ^81</p></li>

<li><p>That extreme country of the North was not unknown to the
conquerors of Italy: the ties of ancient consanguinity had been
strengthened by recent offices of friendship; and a Scandinavian king
had cheerfully abdicated his savage greatness, that he might pass the
remainder of his days in the peaceful and polished court of Ravenna. ^6
Many vestiges, which cannot be ascribed to the arts of popular vanity,
attest the ancient residence of the Goths in the countries beyond the
Rhine. From the time of the geographer Ptolemy, the southern part of
Sweden seems to have continued in the possession of the less
enterprising remnant of the nation, and a large territory is even at
present divided into east and west Gothland. During the middle ages,
(from the ninth to the twelfth century,) whilst Christianity was
advancing with a slow progress into the North, the Goths and the Swedes
composed two distinct and sometimes hostile members of the same
monarchy. ^7 The latter of these two names has prevailed without
extinguishing the former. The Swedes, who might well be satisfied with
their own fame in arms, have, in every age, claimed the kindred glory of
the Goths. In a moment of discontent against the court of Rome, Charles
the Twelfth insinuated, that his victorious troops were not degenerated
from their brave ancestors, who had already subdued the mistress of the
world. ^8</p></li>
<li><p>: The Goths have inhabited Scandinavia, but it was not their
original habitation. This great nation was anciently of the Suevian
race; it occupied, in the time of Tacitus, and long before,
Mecklenburgh, Pomerania Southern Prussia and the north-west of Poland. A
little before the birth of J. C., and in the first years of that
century, they belonged to the kingdom of Marbod, king of the Marcomanni:
but Cotwalda, a young Gothic prince, delivered them from that tyranny,
and established his own power over the kingdom of the Marcomanni,
already much weakened by the victories of Tiberius. The power of the
Goths at that time must have been great: it was probably from them that
the Sinus Codanus (the Baltic) took this name, as it was afterwards
called Mare Suevicum, and Mare Venedicum, during the superiority of the
proper Suevi and the Venedi. The epoch in which the Goths passed into
Scandinavia is unknown. See Adelung, Hist. of Anc. Germany, p. 200.

<li><p>: The Eddas have at length been made accessible to European
scholars by the completion of the publication of the Saemundine Edda by
the Arna Magnaean Commission, in 3 vols. 4to., with a copious lexicon of
northern mythology. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>: This opinion is by no means probable. The Vandals and the Goths
equally belonged to the great division of the Suevi, but the two tribes
were very different. Those who have treated on this part of history,
appear to me to have neglected to remark that the ancients almost always
gave the name of the dominant and conquering people to all the weaker
and conquered races. So Pliny calls Vindeli, Vandals, all the people of
the north-east of Europe, because at that epoch the Vandals were
doubtless the conquering tribe. Caesar, on the contrary, ranges under
the name of Suevi, many of the tribes whom Pliny reckons as Vandals,
because the Suevi, properly so called, were then the most powerful tribe
in Germany. When the Goths, become in their turn conquerors, had
subjugated the nations whom they encountered on their way, these nations
lost their name with their liberty, and became of Gothic origin. The
Vandals themselves were then considered as Goths; the Heruli, the
Gepidae, andandandandc., suffered the same fate. A common origin was
thus attributed to tribes who had only been united by the conquests of
some dominant nation, and this confusion has given rise to a number of
historical errors. - G.</p></li>
<li><p>With better authority, a Sarmatian extraction may be assigned to
the Venedi, who rendered themselves so famous in the middle ages. ^26
But the confusion of blood and manners on that doubtful frontier often
perplexed the most accurate observers. ^27 As the Goths advanced near
the Euxine Sea, they encountered a purer race of Sarmatians, the
Jazyges, the Alani, ^!! and the Roxolani; and they were probably the
first Germans who saw the mouths of the Borysthenes, and of the Tanais.
If we inquire into the characteristic marks of the people of Germany and
of Sarmatia, we shall discover that those two great portions of human
kind were principally distinguished by fixed huts or movable tents, by a
close dress or flowing garments, by the marriage of one or of several
wives, by a military force, consisting, for the most part, either of
infantry or cavalry; and above all, by the use of the Teutonic, or of
the Sclavonian language; the last of which has been diffused by
conquest, from the confines of Italy to the neighborhood of
Japan.</p></li>
<li><p>: The Bastarnae cannot be considered original inhabitants of
Germany Strabo and Tacitus appear to doubt it; Pliny alone calls them
Germans: Ptolemy and Dion treat them as Scythians, a vague appellation
at this period of history; Livy, Plutarch, and Diodorus Siculus, call
them Gauls, and this is the most probable opinion. They descended from
the Gauls who entered Germany under Signoesus. They are always found
associated with other Gaulish tribes, such as the Boll, the Taurisci,
andandandandc., and not to the German tribes. The names of their chiefs
or princes, Chlonix, Chlondicus. Deldon, are not German names. Those who
were settled in the island of Peuce in the Danube, took the name of
Peucini.</p></li>

Cherusci, proud of the fame of Arminius; of the Catti, formidable by
their firm and intrepid infantry; and of several other tribes of
inferior power and renown. ^72 The love of liberty was the ruling
passion of these Germans; the enjoyment of it their best treasure; the
word that expressed that enjoyment, the most pleasing to their ear. They
deserved, they assumed, they maintained the honorable appellation of
Franks, or Freemen; which concealed, though it did not extinguish, the
peculiar names of the several states of the confederacy. ^73 Tacit
consent, and mutual advantage, dictated the first laws of the union; it
was gradually cemented by habit and experience. The league of the Franks
may admit of some comparison with the Helvetic body; in which every
canton, retaining its independent sovereignty, consults with its
brethren in the common cause, without acknowledging the authority of any
supreme head, or representative assembly. ^74 But the principle of the
two confederacies was extremely different. A peace of two hundred years
has rewarded the wise and honest policy of the Swiss. An inconstant
spirit, the thirst of rapine, and a disregard to the most solemn

religious dispute, ^173 were at any time sufficient to kindle a sedition
among that vast multitude, whose resentments were furious and
implacable. ^174 After the captivity of Valerian and the insolence of
his son had relaxed the authority of the laws, the Alexandrians
abandoned themselves to the ungoverned rage of their passions, and their
unhappy country was the theatre of a civil war, which continued (with a

that, while he pursued the Gothic war, she should assert the dignity of
the empire in the East. ^61 The conduct, however, of Zenobia, was
attended with some ambiguity; not is it unlikely that she had conceived
the design of erecting an independent and hostile monarchy. She blended
with the popular manners of Roman princes the stately pomp of the courts
of Asia, and exacted from her subjects the same adoration that was paid
to the successor of Cyrus. She bestowed on her three sons ^61 a Latin
education, and often showed them to the troops adorned with the Imperial

doubtful title of Queen of the East.</p></li>

been at the beginning of the reign of Aurelian. The same circumstance
throws great improbability on her conquests in Galatia. Perhaps Zenobia
administered Egypt in the name of Claudius, and emboldened by the death
of that prince, subjected it to her own power. - G.]</p></li>

They were faithful to their engagements; but when they arrived on the
Roman frontier, Aurelian was already dead, the design of the Persian war
was at least suspended, and the generals, who, during the interregnum,
exercised a doubtful authority, were unprepared either to receive or to
oppose them. Provoked by such treatment, which they considered as
trifling and perfidious, the Alani had recourse to their own valor for
their payment and revenge; and as they moved with the usual swiftness of
Tartars, they had soon spread themselves over the provinces of Pontus,
Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Galatia. The legions, who from the opposite
shores of the Bosphorus could almost distinguish the flames of the
cities and villages, impatiently urged their general to lead them
against the invaders. The conduct of Tacitus was suitable to his age and
station. He convinced the barbarians of the faith, as well as the power,
of the empire. Great numbers of the Alani, appeased by the punctual
discharge of the engagements which Aurelian had contracted with them,
relinquished their booty and captives, and quietly retreated to their
own deserts, beyond the Phasis. Against the remainder, who refused
peace, the Roman emperor waged, in person, a successful war. Seconded by
an army of brave and experienced veterans, in a few weeks he delivered
the provinces of Asia from the terror of the Scythian invasion.

the sovereign authority. ^10 Galerius, surnamed Armentarius, from his
original profession of a herdsman, and Constantius, who from his pale
complexion had acquired the denomination of Chlorus, ^11 were the two
persons invested with the second honors of the Imperial purple. In
describing the country, extraction, and manners of Herculius, we have
already delineated those of Galerius, who was often, and not improperly,
styled the younger Maximian, though, in many instances both of virtue
and ability, he appears to have possessed a manifest superiority over
the elder. The birth of Constantius was less obscure than that of his
colleagues. Eutropius, his father, was one of the most considerable
nobles of Dardania, and his mother was the niece of the emperor
Claudius. ^12 Although the youth of Constantius had been spent in arms,
he was endowed with a mild and amiable disposition, and the popular
voice had long since acknowledged him worthy of the rank which he at
last attained. To strengthen the bonds of political, by those of
domestic, union, each of the emperors assumed the character of a father
to one of the Caesars, Diocletian to Galerius, and Maximian to
Constantius; and each, obliging them to repudiate their former wives,
bestowed his daughter in marriage or his adopted son. ^13 These four
princes distributed among themselves the wide extent of the Roman
empire. The defence of Gaul, Spain, ^14 and Britain, was intrusted to
Constantius: Galerius was stationed on the banks of the Danube, as the
safeguard of the Illyrian provinces. Italy and Africa were considered as
the department of Maximian; and for his peculiar portion, Diocletian
reserved Thrace, Egypt, and the rich countries of Asia. Every one was
sovereign with his own jurisdiction; but their united authority extended
over the whole monarchy, and each of them was prepared to assist his
colleagues with his counsels or presence. The Caesars, in their exalted
rank, revered the majesty of the emperors, and the three younger princes
invariably acknowledged, by their gratitude and obedience, the common
parent of their fortunes. The suspicious jealousy of power found not any
place among them; and the singular happiness of their union has been
compared to a chorus of music, whose harmony was regulated and
maintained by the skilful hand of the first artist. ^15</p></li>

It is almost needless to observe, that Tiridates, the faithful ally of
Rome, was restored to the throne of his fathers, and that the rights of
the Imperial supremacy were fully asserted and secured. The limits of
Armenia were extended as far as the fortress of Sintha in Media, and
this increase of dominion was not so much an act of liberality as of
justice. Of the provinces already mentioned beyond the Tigris, the four
first had been dismembered by the Parthians from the crown of Armenia;
^81 and when the Romans acquired the possession of them, they
stipulated, at the expense of the usurpers, an ample compensation, which
invested their ally with the extensive and fertile country of
Atropatene. Its principal city, in the same situation perhaps as the
modern Tauris, was frequently honored by the residence of Tiridates; and
as it sometimes bore the name of Ecbatana, he imitated, in the buildings
and fortifications, the splendid capital of the Medes. ^82 IV. The

defiles of Mount Caucasus were in their hands, and it was in their
choice, either to admit or to exclude the wandering tribes of Sarmatia,
whenever a rapacious spirit urged them to penetrate into the richer
climes of the South. ^83 The nomination of the kings of Iberia, which
was resigned by the Persian monarch to the emperors, contributed to the
strength and security of the Roman power in Asia. ^84 The East enjoyed a
profound tranquillity during forty years; and the treaty between the
rival monarchies was strictly observed till the death of Tiridates; when

<li><p>The emperor Diocletian was indeed the author of that system; but
during his reign, the growing evil was confined within the bounds of
modesty and discretion, and he deserves the reproach of establishing
pernicious precedents, rather than of exercising actual oppression. ^105
It may be added, that his revenues were managed with prudent economy;
and that after all the current expenses were discharged, there still
remained in the Imperial treasury an ample provision either for
judicious liberality or for any emergency of the state.</p></li>
<li><p>: The most curious document which has come to light since the
publication of Gibbon’s History, is the edict of Diocletian, published
from an inscription found at Eskihissar, (Stratoniccia,) by Col. Leake.
This inscription was first copied by Sherard, afterwards much more
completely by Mr. Bankes. It is confirmed and illustrated by a more
imperfect copy of the same edict, found in the Levant by a gentleman of
Aix, and brought to this country by M. Vescovali. This edict was issued
in the name of the four Caesars, Diocletian, Maximian, Constantius, and
Galerius. It fixed a maximum of prices throughout the empire, for all
the necessaries and commodities of life. The preamble insists, with
great vehemence on the extortion and inhumanity of the venders and
merchants. Quis enim adeo obtunisi (obtusi) pectores (is) et a sensu
inhumanitatis extorris est qui ignorare potest immo non senserit in
venalibus rebus quaevel in mercimoniis aguntur vel diurna urbium
conversatione tractantur, in tantum se licen liam defusisse, ut
effraenata libido rapien - rum copia nec annorum ubertatibus
mitigaretur. The edict, as Col. Leake clearly shows, was issued A. C.
303. Among the articles of which the maximum value is assessed, are oil,
salt, honey, butchers’ meat, poultry, game, fish, vegetables, fruit the
wages of laborers and artisans, schoolmasters and skins, boots and
shoes, harness, timber, corn, wine, and beer, (zythus.) The depreciation
in the value of money, or the rise in the price of commodities, had been
so great during the past century, that butchers’ meat, which, in the
second century of the empire, was in Rome about two denaril the pound,
was now fixed at a maximum of eight. Col. Leake supposes the average
price could not be less than four: at the same time the maximum of the
wages of the agricultural laborers was twenty-five. The whole edict is,
perhaps, the most gigantic effort of a blind though well-intentioned
despotism, to control that which is, and ought to be, beyond the
regulation of the government. See an Edict of Diocletian, by Col. Leake,
London, 1826. Col. Leake has not observed that this Edict is expressly
named in the treatise de Mort. Persecut. ch. vii. Idem cum variis
iniquitatibus immensam faceret caritatem, legem pretiis rerum venalium

afterwards of Africa, directing immediate and sufficient relief to be
given to those parents who should produce before the magistrates the
children whom their own poverty would not allow them to educate. But the
promise was too liberal, and the provision too vague, to effect any
general or permanent benefit. ^93 The law, though it may merit some
praise, served rather to display than to alleviate the public distress.
It still remains an authentic monument to contradict and confound those
venal orators, who were too well satisfied with their own situation to
discover either vice or misery under the government of a generous
sovereign. ^94 2. The laws of Constantine against rapes were dictated
with very little indulgence for the most amiable weaknesses of human
nature; since the description of that crime was applied not only to the
brutal violence which compelled, but even to the gentle seduction which
might persuade, an unmarried woman, under the age of twenty-five, to
leave the house of her parents. “The successful ravisher was punished
with death; and as if simple death was inadequate to the enormity of his
guilt, he was either burnt alive, or torn in pieces by wild beasts in
the amphitheatre. The virgin’s declaration, that she had been carried
away with her own consent, instead of saving her lover, exposed her to
share his fate. The duty of a public prosecution was intrusted to the
parents of the guilty or unfortunate maid; and if the sentiments of
nature prevailed on them to dissemble the injury, and to repair by a
subsequent marriage the honor of their family, they were themselves
punished by exile and confiscation. The slaves, whether male or female,
who were convicted of having been accessory to rape or seduction, were
burnt alive, or put to death by the ingenious torture of pouring down
their throats a quantity of melted lead. As the crime was of a public
kind, the accusation was permitted even to strangers.</p></li>
<li><p>: This explanation appears to me little probable. Godefroy has
made a much more happy conjecture, supported by all the historical
circumstances which relate to this edict. It was published the 12th of
May, A. D. 315. at Naissus in Pannonia, the birthplace of Constantine.
The 8th of October, in that year, Constantine gained the victory of
Cibalis over Licinius. He was yet uncertain as to the fate of the war:
the Christians, no doubt, whom he favored, had prophesied his victory.
Lactantius, then preceptor of Crispus, had just written his work upon
Christianity, (his Divine Institutes;) he had dedicated it to
Constantine. In this book he had inveighed with great force against
infanticide, and the exposure of infants, (l. vi. c. 20.) Is it not
probable that Constantine had read this work, that he had conversed on
the subject with Lactantius, that he was moved, among other things, by
the passage to which I have referred, and in the first transport of his
enthusiasm, he published the edict in question? The whole of the edict
bears the character of precipitation, of excitement, (entrainement,)
rather than of deliberate reflection - the extent of the promises, the
indefiniteness of the means, of the conditions, and of the time during
which the parents might have a right to the succor of the state. Is
there not reason to believe that the humanity of Constantine was excited
by the influence of Lactantius, by that of the principles of
Christianity, and of the Christians themselves, already in high esteem
with the emperor, rather than by some “extraordinary instances of
despair“?</p></li>

or at least respected, each other’s superstitions. A single people
refused to join in the common intercourse of mankind. The Jews, who,
under the Assyrian and Persian monarchies, had languished for many ages
the most despised portion of their slaves, ^1 emerged from obscurity
under the successors of Alexander; and as they multiplied to a
surprising degree in the East, and afterwards in the West, they soon
excited the curiosity and wonder of other nations. ^2 The sullen
obstinacy with which they maintained their peculiar rites and unsocial
manners, seemed to mark them out as a distinct species of men, who
boldly professed, or who faintly disguised, their implacable habits to
the rest of human kind. ^3 Neither the violence of Antiochus, nor the
arts of Herod, nor the example of the circumjacent nations, could ever
persuade the Jews to associate with the institutions of Moses the
elegant mythology of the Greeks. ^4 According to the maxims of universal
toleration, the Romans protected a superstition which they despised. ^5
The polite Augustus condescended to give orders, that sacrifices should
be offered for his prosperity in the temple of Jerusalem; ^6 whilst the
meanest of the posterity of Abraham, who should have paid the same
homage to the Jupiter of the Capitol, would have been an object of
abhorrence to himself and to his brethren.</p></li>
<li><p>: This facility has not always prevented intolerance, which seems
inherent in the religious spirit, when armed with authority. The
separation of the ecclesiastical and civil power, appears to be the only
means of at once maintaining religion and tolerance: but this is a very
modern notion. The passions, which mingle themselves with opinions, made
the Pagans very often intolerant and persecutors; witness the Persians,
the Egyptians even the Greeks and Romans.</p></li>

still enjoyed the comfort of making frequent and devout visits to the
Holy City, and the hope of being one day restored to those seats which
both nature and religion taught them to love as well as to revere. But
at length, under the reign of Hadrian, the desperate fanaticism of the
Jews filled up the measure of their calamities; and the Romans,
exasperated by their repeated rebellions, exercised the rights of
victory with unusual rigor. The emperor founded, under the name of Aelia
Capitolina, a new city on Mount Sion, ^20 to which he gave the
privileges of a colony; and denouncing the severest penalties against
any of the Jewish people who should dare to approach its precincts, he
fixed a vigilant garrison of a Roman cohort to enforce the execution of
his orders. The Nazarenes had only one way left to escape the common
proscription, and the force of truth was on this occasion assisted by
the influence of temporal advantages. They elected Marcus for their
bishop, a prelate of the race of the Gentiles, and most probably a
native either of Italy or of some of the Latin provinces. At his
persuasion, the most considerable part of the congregation renounced the
Mosaic law, in the practice of which they had persevered above a
century. By this sacrifice of their habits and prejudices, they
purchased a free admission into the colony of Hadrian, and more firmly
cemented their union with the Catholic church. ^21</p></li>

executions, and of massacres, which stain almost every page of the
Jewish annals, they acknowledged that the barbarians of Palestine had
exercised as much compassion towards their idolatrous enemies, as they
had ever shown to their friends or countrymen. ^27 Passing from the
sectaries of the law to the law itself, they asserted that it was
impossible that a religion which consisted only of bloody sacrifices and
trifling ceremonies, and whose rewards as well as punishments were all
of a carnal and temporal nature, could inspire the love of virtue, or
restrain the impetuosity of passion. The Mosaic account of the creation
and fall of man was treated with profane derision by the Gnostics, who
would not listen with patience to the repose of the Deity after six
days’ labor, to the rib of Adam, the garden of Eden, the trees of life
and of knowledge, the speaking serpent, the forbidden fruit, and the
condemnation pronounced against human kind for the venial offence of
their first progenitors. ^28 The God of Israel was impiously represented
by the Gnostics as a being liable to passion and to error, capricious in
his favor, implacable in his resentment, meanly jealous of his
superstitious worship, and confining his partial providence to a single
people, and to this transitory life. In such a character they could
discover none of the features of the wise and omnipotent Father of the
universe. ^29 They allowed that the religion of the Jews was somewhat
less criminal than the idolatry of the Gentiles; but it was their
fundamental doctrine, that the Christ whom they adored as the first and
brightest emanation of the Deity appeared upon earth to rescue mankind
from their various errors, and to reveal a new system of truth and
perfection. The most learned of the fathers, by a very singular
condescension, have imprudently admitted the sophistry of the Gnostics.

discourse of Christ himself, were obliged to expect the second and
glorious coming of the Son of Man in the clouds, before that generation
was totally extinguished, which had beheld his humble condition upon
earth, and which might still be witness of the calamities of the Jews
under Vespasian or Hadrian. The revolution of seventeen centuries has
instructed us not to press too closely the mysterious language of
prophecy and revelation; but as long as, for wise purposes, this error
was permitted to subsist in the church, it was productive of the most
salutary effects on the faith and practice of Christians, who lived in
the awful expectation of that moment, when the globe itself, and all the
various race of mankind, should tremble at the appearance of their
divine Judge. ^60</p></li>

divine impulse, poured forth the effusions of the Spirit in the assembly
of the faithful. But these extraordinary gifts were frequently abused or
misapplied by the prophetic teachers. They displayed them at an improper
season, presumptuously disturbed the service of the assembly, and, by
their pride or mistaken zeal, they introduced, particularly into the
apostolic church of Corinth, a long and melancholy train of disorders.
^107 As the institution of prophets became useless, and even pernicious,
their powers were withdrawn, and their office abolished. The public
functions of religion were solely intrusted to the established ministers
of the church, the bishops and the presbyters; two appellations which,
in their first origin, appear to have distinguished the same office and
the same order of persons. The name of Presbyter was expressive of their
age, or rather of their gravity and wisdom. The title of Bishop denoted
their inspection over the faith and manners of the Christians who were
committed to their pastoral care. In proportion to the respective
numbers of the faithful, a larger or smaller number of these episcopal
presbyters guided each infant congregation with equal authority and with
united counsels. ^108</p></li>

<li><p>and they may justly be supposed to have borrowed the model of a
representative council from the celebrated examples of their own
country, the Amphictyons, the Achaean league, or the assemblies of the
Ionian cities. It was soon established as a custom and as a law, that
the bishops of the independent churches should meet in the capital of
the province at the stated periods of spring and autumn. Their
deliberations were assisted by the advice of a few distinguished
presbyters, and moderated by the presence of a listening multitude. ^115
Their decrees, which were styled Canons, regulated every important
controversy of faith and discipline; and it was natural to believe that
a liberal effusion of the Holy Spirit would be poured on the united
assembly of the delegates of the Christian people. The institution of
synods was so well suited to private ambition, and to public interest,
that in the space of a few years it was received throughout the whole
empire. A regular correspondence was established between the provincial
councils, which mutually communicated and approved their respective
proceedings; and the catholic church soon assumed the form, and acquired
the strength, of a great foederative republic. ^116</p></li>
<li><p>: The synods were not the first means taken by the insulated
churches to enter into communion and to assume a corporate character.
The dioceses were first formed by the union of several country churches
with a church in a city: many churches in one city uniting among
themselves, or joining a more considerable church, became metropolitan.
The dioceses were not formed before the beginning of the second century:
before that time the Christians had not established sufficient churches
in the country to stand in need of that union. It is towards the middle
of the same century that we discover the first traces of the
metropolitan constitution. (Probably the country churches were founded
in general by missionaries from those in the city, and would preserve a
natural connection with the parent church.) - M. The provincial synods
did not commence till towards the middle of the third century, and were
not the first synods. History gives us distinct notions of the synods,
held towards the end of the second century, at Ephesus at Jerusalem, at
Pontus, and at Rome, to put an end to the disputes which had arisen
between the Latin and Asiatic churches about the celebration of Easter.
But these synods were not subject to any regular form or periodical
return; this regularity was first established with the provincial
synods, which were formed by a union of the bishops of a district,
subject to a metropolitan. Plank, p. 90. Geschichte der Christ. Kirch.

condemnatum,) on the charge not only of schism, but of embezzlement of
public money, the debauching of virgins, and frequent acts of adultery.
His violent menaces had extorted his readmission into the church,
against which Cyprian protests with much vehemence: ne pecuniae
commissae sibi fraudator, ne stuprator virginum, ne matrimoniorum
multorum depopulator et corruptor, ultra adhuc sponsam Christi
incorruptam praesentiae suae dedecore, et impudica atque incesta
contagione, violaret. See Chelsum’s Remarks, p. 134. If these charges
against Felicissimus were true, they were something more than
“irregularities,“ A Roman censor would have been a fairer subject of
comparison than a consul. On the other hand, it must be admitted that
the charge of adultery deepens very rapidly as the controversy becomes
more violent. It is first represented as a single act, recently
detected, and which men of character were prepared to substantiate:
adulterii etiam crimen accedit. quod patres nostri graves viri
deprehendisse se nuntiaverunt, et probaturos se asseverarunt. Epist.
xxxviii. The heretic has now darkened into a man of notorious and
general profligacy. Nor can it be denied that of the whole long epistle,
very far the larger and the more passionate part dwells on the breach of
ecclesiastical unity rather than on the violation of Christian holiness.

<li><p>which the primitive Christians repeatedly published in behalf of
themselves and of their religion; but it is much to be lamented that
such a cause was not defended by abler advocates. They expose with
superfluous with and eloquence the extravagance of Polytheism. They
interest our compassion by displaying the innocence and sufferings of
their injured brethren. But when they would demonstrate the divine
origin of Christianity, they insist much more strongly on the
predictions which announced, than on the miracles which accompanied, the
appearance of the Messiah. Their favorite argument might serve to edify
a Christian or to convert a Jew, since both the one and the other
acknowledge the authority of those prophecies, and both are obliged,
with devout reverence, to search for their sense and their
accomplishment. But this mode of persuasion loses much of its weight and
influence, when it is addressed to those who neither understand nor
respect the Mosaic dispensation and the prophetic style. ^192 In the
unskilful hands of Justin and of the succeeding apologists, the sublime
meaning of the Hebrew oracles evaporates in distant types, affected
conceits, and cold allegories; and even their authenticity was rendered
suspicious to an unenlightened Gentile, by the mixture of pious
forgeries, which, under the names of Orpheus, Hermes, and the Sibyls,
^193 were obtruded on him as of equal value with the genuine
inspirations of Heaven. The adoption of fraud and sophistry in the
defence of revelation too often reminds us of the injudicious conduct of
those poets who load their invulnerable heroes with a useless weight of

the Acts of the Apostles, and in order to speak of the first
persecutions experienced by the Christians, that book should naturally
have been consulted; those persecutions, then limited to individuals and
to a narrow sphere, interested only the persecuted, and have been
related by them alone. Gibbon making the persecutions ascend no higher
than Nero, has entirely omitted those which preceded this epoch, and of
which St. Luke has preserved the memory. The only way to justify this
omission was, to attack the authenticity of the Acts of the Apostles;
for, if authentic, they must necessarily be consulted and quoted. Now,
antiquity has left very few works of which the authenticity is so well
established as that of the Acts of the Apostles. (See Lardner’s Cred. of

Gibbon has maintained silence concerning the narrative of St. Luke, and

<li><p>and not only spread itself over Judaea, the first seat of this
mischievous sect, but was even introduced into Rome, the common asylum
which receives and protects whatever is impure, whatever is atrocious.
The confessions of those who were seized discovered a great multitude of
their accomplices, and they were all convicted, not so much for the
crime of setting fire to the city, as for their hatred of human kind.
^32 They died in torments, and their torments were imbittered by insult
and derision. Some were nailed on crosses; others sewn up in the skins
of wild beasts, and exposed to the fury of dogs; others again, smeared
over with combustible materials, were used as torches to illuminate the
darkness of the night. The gardens of Nero were destined for the
melancholy spectacle, which was accompanied with a horse-race and
honored with the presence of the emperor, who mingled with the populace
in the dress and attitude of a charioteer. The guilt of the Christians
deserved indeed the most exemplary punishment, but the public abhorrence
was changed into commiseration, from the opinion that those unhappy
wretches were sacrificed, not so much to the public welfare, as to the
cruelty of a jealous tyrant.“ ^33 Those who survey with a curious eye
the revolutions of mankind, may observe, that the gardens and circus of
Nero on the Vatican, which were polluted with the blood of the first
Christians, have been rendered still more famous by the triumph and by
the abuse of the persecuted religion. On the same spot, ^34 a temple,
which far surpasses the ancient glories of the Capitol, has been since
erected by the Christian Pontiffs, who, deriving their claim of
universal dominion from an humble fisherman of Galilee, have succeeded
to the throne of the Caesars, given laws to the barbarian conquerors of
Rome, and extended their spiritual jurisdiction from the coast of the
Baltic to the shores of the Pacific Ocean.</p></li>
<li><p>: This single phrase, Repressa in praesens exitiabilis
superstitio rursus erumpebat, proves that the Christians had already
attracted the attention of the government; and that Nero was not the
first to persecute them. I am surprised that more stress has not been

these words of Tacitus, Repressa in praesens, and rursus erumpebat. -

Whatever opinion may be entertained of this conjecture, (for it is no
more than a conjecture,) it is evident that the effect, as well as the
cause, of Nero’s persecution, was confined to the walls of Rome, ^43 ^!
that the religious tenets of the Galilaeans or Christians, were never
made a subject of punishment, or even of inquiry; and that, as the idea
of their sufferings was for a long time connected with the idea of
cruelty and injustice, the moderation of succeeding princes inclined
them to spare a sect, oppressed by a tyrant, whose rage had been usually
directed against virtue and innocence.</p></li>
<li><p>: This conjecture is entirely devoid, not merely of
verisimilitude, but even of possibility. Tacitus could not be deceived
in appropriating to the Christians of Rome the guilt and the sufferings
which he might have attributed with far greater truth to the followers
of Judas the Gaulonite, for the latter never went to Rome. Their revolt,
their attempts, their opinions, their wars, their punishment, had no
other theatre but Judaea (Basn. Hist. des. Juifs, t. i. p. 491.)

<li><p>but soon recovering that fortitude which his character required,
he returned to his gardens, and patiently expected the ministers of
death. Two officers of rank, who were intrusted with that commission,
placed Cyprian between them in a chariot, and as the proconsul was not
then at leisure, they conducted him, not to a prison, but to a private
house in Carthage, which belonged to one of them. An elegant supper was
provided for the entertainment of the bishop, and his Christian friends
were permitted for the last time to enjoy his society, whilst the
streets were filled with a multitude of the faithful, anxious and
alarmed at the approaching fate of their spiritual father. ^86 In the
morning he appeared before the tribunal of the proconsul, who, after
informing himself of the name and situation of Cyprian, commanded him to
offer sacrifice, and pressed him to reflect on the consequences of his
disobedience. The refusal of Cyprian was firm and decisive; and the
magistrate, when he had taken the opinion of his council, pronounced
with some reluctance the sentence of death. It was conceived in the
following terms: “That Thascius Cyprianus should be immediately
beheaded, as the enemy of the gods of Rome, and as the chief and
ringleader of a criminal association, which he had seduced into an
impious resistance against the laws of the most holy emperors, Valerian
and Gallienus.“ ^87 The manner of his execution was the mildest and
least painful that could be inflicted on a person convicted of any
capital offence; nor was the use of torture admitted to obtain from the
bishop of Carthage either the recantation of his principles or the
discovery of his accomplices.</p></li>
<li><p>: This was not, as it appears, the motive which induced
St. Cyprian to conceal himself for a short time; he was threatened to be
carried to Utica; he preferred remaining at Carthage, in order to suffer
martyrdom in the midst of his flock, and in order that his death might
conduce to the edification of those whom he had guided during life.
Such, at least, is his own explanation of his conduct in one of his
letters: Cum perlatum ad nos fuisset, fratres carissimi, frumentarios
esse missos qui me Uticam per ducerent, consilioque carissimorum
persuasum est, ut de hortis interim recederemus, justa interveniente

The martyr then covered his face with his hands, and at one blow his
head was separated from his body. His corpse remained during some hours
exposed to the curiosity of the Gentiles: but in the night it was
removed, and transported in a triumphal procession, and with a splendid
illumination, to the burial-place of the Christians. The funeral of
Cyprian was publicly celebrated without receiving any interruption from
the Roman magistrates; and those among the faithful, who had performed
the last offices to his person and his memory, were secure from the
danger of inquiry or of punishment. It is remarkable, that of so great a
multitude of bishops in the province of Africa, Cyprian was the first
who was esteemed worthy to obtain the crown of martyrdom. ^88</p></li>
<li><p>: There is nothing in the life of St. Cyprian, by Pontius, nor in
the ancient manuscripts, which can make us suppose that the presbyters
and deacons in their clerical character, and known to be such, had the
permission to attend their holy bishop. Setting aside all religious
considerations, it is impossible not to be surprised at the kind of

<li>In every persecution there were great numbers of unworthy Christians
who publicly disowned or renounced the faith which they had professed;
and who confirmed the sincerity of their abjuration, by the legal acts
of burning incense or of offering sacrifices. Some of these apostates
had yielded on the first menace or exhortation of the magistrate; whilst
the patience of others had been subdued by the length and repetition of
tortures. The affrighted countenances of some betrayed their inward
remorse, while others advanced with confidence and alacrity to the
altars of the gods. ^102 But the disguise which fear had imposed,
subsisted no longer than the present danger. As soon as the severity of
the persecution was abated, the doors of the churches were assailed by
the returning multitude of penitents who detested their idolatrous
submission, and who solicited with equal ardor, but with various
success, their readmission into the society of Christians. ^103 ^!</li>

<li><p>: Gibbon, with this phrase, and that below, which admits the
injustice of Marcus, has dexterously glossed over one of the most
remarkable facts in the early Christian history, that the reign of the
wisest and most humane of the heathen emperors was the most fatal to the
Christians. Most writers have ascribed the persecutions under Marcus to
the latent bigotry of his character; Mosheim, to the influence of the
philosophic party; but the fact is admitted by all. A late writer
(Mr. Waddington, Hist. of the Church, p. 47) has not scrupled to assert,
that “this prince polluted every year of a long reign with innocent
blood;“ but the causes as well as the date of the persecutions
authorized or permitted by Marcus are equally uncertain. Of the Asiatic
edict recorded by Melito. the date is unknown, nor is it quite clear
that it was an Imperial edict. If it was the act under which Polycarp
suffered, his martyrdom is placed by Ruinart in the sixth, by Mosheim in
the ninth, year of the reign of Marcus. The martyrs of Vienne and Lyons
are assigned by Dodwell to the seventh, by most writers to the
seventeenth. In fact, the commencement of the persecutions of the
Christians appears to synchronize exactly with the period of the
breaking out of the Marcomannic war, which seems to have alarmed the
whole empire, and the emperor himself, into a paroxysm of returning
piety to their gods, of which the Christians were the victims. See Jul,
Capit. Script. Hist August. p. 181, edit. 1661. It is remarkable that

it was occasioned by an incident, which, however trifling, bore some
relation to the cause of Christianity. ^108 Under the reign of Severus,
the fury of the populace was checked; the rigor of ancient laws was for
some time suspended; and the provincial governors were satisfied with
receiving an annual present from the churches within their jurisdiction,
as the price, or as the reward, of their moderation. ^109 The
controversy concerning the precise time of the celebration of Easter,
armed the bishops of Asia and Italy against each other, and was
considered as the most important business of this period of leisure and
tranquillity. ^110 Nor was the peace of the church interrupted, till the
increasing numbers of proselytes seem at length to have attracted the
attention, and to have alienated the mind of Severus. With the design of
restraining the progress of Christianity, he published an edict, which,
though it was designed to affect only the new converts, could not be
carried into strict execution, without exposing to danger and punishment
the most zealous of their teachers and missionaries. In this mitigated
persecution we may still discover the indulgent spirit of Rome and of
Polytheism, which so readily admitted every excuse in favor of those who
practised the religious ceremonies of their fathers. ^111</p></li>

obstinately maintained, concerning the doctrine of the Trinity, excited
the zeal and indignation of the Eastern churches. ^129 From Egypt to the
Euxine Sea, the bishops were in arms and in motion. Several councils
were held, confutations were published, excommunications were
pronounced, ambiguous explanations were by turns accepted and refused,
treaties were concluded and violated, and at length Paul of Samosata was
degraded from his episcopal character, by the sentence of seventy or
eighty bishops, who assembled for that purpose at Antioch, and who,
without consulting the rights of the clergy or people, appointed a
successor by their own authority. The manifest irregularity of this

Paul of Samosata had much weight in the sentence pronounced against him

protection of the severe Zenobia is the only circumstance which may
raise a doubt of the notorious immorality of Paul. - M.]</p></li>

<li><p>before the magistrate as a sufficient and legal recruit, but who
obstinately persisted in declaring, that his conscience would not permit
him to embrace the profession of a soldier. ^145 It could scarcely be
expected that any government should suffer the action of Marcellus the
Centurion to pass with impunity. On the day of a public festival, that
officer threw away his belt, his arms, and the ensigns of his office,
and exclaimed with a loud voice, that he would obey none but Jesus
Christ the eternal King, and that he renounced forever the use of carnal
weapons, and the service of an idolatrous master. The soldiers, as soon
as they recovered from their astonishment, secured the person of
Marcellus. He was examined in the city of Tingi by the president of that
part of Mauritania; and as he was convicted by his own confession, he
was condemned and beheaded for the crime of desertion. ^146 Examples of
such a nature savor much less of religious persecution than of martial
or even civil law; but they served to alienate the mind of the emperors,
to justify the severity of Galerius, who dismissed a great number of
Christian officers from their employments; and to authorize the opinion,
that a sect of enthusiastics, which avowed principles so repugnant to
the public safety, must either remain useless, or would soon become
dangerous, subjects of the empire.</p></li>
<li><p>: M. Guizot criticizes Gibbon’s account of this incident. He
supposes that Maximilian was not “produced by his father as a recruit,“
but was obliged to appear by the law, which compelled the sons of
soldiers to serve at 21 years old. Was not this a law of Constantine?
Neither does this circumstance appear in the acts. His father had
clearly expected him to serve, as he had bought him a new dress for the
occasion; yet he refused to force the conscience of his son. and when
Maximilian was condemned to death, the father returned home in joy,
blessing God for having bestowed upon him such a son. - M.]</p></li>

<li><p>which was less tinctured with credulity, and more practised in
the arts of courts, than that of almost any of his contemporaries. On
some particular occasions, when the magistrates were exasperated by some
personal motives of interest or resentment, the rules of prudence, and
perhaps of decency, to overturn the altars, to pour out imprecations
against the emperors, or to strike the judge as he sat on his tribunal,
it may be presumed, that every mode of torture which cruelty could
invent, or constancy could endure, was exhausted on those devoted
victims. ^179 Two circumstances, however, have been unwarily mentioned,
which insinuate that the general treatment of the Christians, who had
been apprehended by the officers of justice, was less intolerable than
it is usually imagined to have been. 1. The confessors who were
condemned to work in the mines were permitted by the humanity or the
negligence of their keepers to build chapels, and freely to profess
their religion in the midst of those dreary habitations. ^180 2. The
bishops were obliged to check and to censure the forward zeal of the
Christians, who voluntarily threw themselves into the hands of the
magistrates. Some of these were persons oppressed by poverty and debts,
who blindly sought to terminate a miserable existence by a glorious
death. Others were allured by the hope that a short confinement would
expiate the sins of a whole life; and others again were actuated by the
less honorable motive of deriving a plentiful subsistence, and perhaps a
considerable profit, from the alms which the charity of the faithful
bestowed on the prisoners. ^181 After the church had triumphed over all
her enemies, the interest as well as vanity of the captives prompted
them to magnify the merit of their respective sufferings. A convenient
distance of time or place gave an ample scope to the progress of
fiction; and the frequent instances which might be alleged of holy
martyrs, whose wounds had been instantly healed, whose strength had been
renewed, and whose lost members had miraculously been restored, were
extremely convenient for the purpose of removing every difficulty, and
of silencing every objection. The most extravagant legends, as they
conduced to the honor of the church, were applauded by the credulous
multitude, countenanced by the power of the clergy, and attested by the
suspicious evidence of ecclesiastical history.</p></li>
<li><p>: Historical criticism does not consist in rejecting
indiscriminately all the facts which do not agree with a particular
system, as Gibbon does in this chapter, in which, except at the last
extremity, he will not consent to believe a martyrdom. Authorities are
to be weighed, not excluded from examination. Now, the Pagan historians
justify in many places the detail which have been transmitted to us by
the historians of the church, concerning the tortures endured by the
Christians. Celsus reproaches the Christians with holding their
assemblies in secret, on account of the fear inspired by their
sufferings, “for when you are arrested,“ he says, “you are dragged to
punishment: and, before you are put to death, you have to suffer all
kinds of tortures.“ Origen cont. Cels. l. i. ii. vi. viii. passing.
Libanius, the panegyrist of Julian, says, while speaking of the
Christians. Those who followed a corrupt religion were in continual
apprehensions; they feared lest Julian should invent tortures still more
refined than those to which they had been exposed before, as mutilation,
burning alive, andandandandc.; for the emperors had inflicted upon them
all these barbarities.“ Lib. Parent in Julian. ap. Fab. Bib. Graec.

<li><p>that we are naturally induced to inquire into a fact of a more
distinct and stubborn kind; the number of persons who suffered death in
consequence of the edicts published by Diocletian, his associates, and
his successors. The recent legendaries record whole armies and cities,
which were at once swept away by the undistinguishing rage of
persecution. The more ancient writers content themselves with pouring
out a liberal effusion of loose and tragical invectives, without
condescending to ascertain the precise number of those persons who were
permitted to seal with their blood their belief of the gospel. From the
history of Eusebius, it may, however, be collected, that only nine
bishops were punished with death; and we are assured, by his particular
enumeration of the martyrs of Palestine, that no more than ninety-two
Christians were entitled to that honorable appellation. ^182 ^! As we
are unacquainted with the degree of episcopal zeal and courage which
prevailed at that time, it is not in our power to draw any useful
inferences from the former of these facts: but the latter may serve to
justify a very important and probable conclusion. According to the
distribution of Roman provinces, Palestine may be considered as the
sixteenth part of the Eastern empire: ^183 and since there were some
governors, who from a real or affected clemency had preserved their
hands unstained with the blood of the faithful, ^184 it is reasonable to
believe, that the country which had given birth to Christianity,
produced at least the sixteenth part of the martyrs who suffered death
within the dominions of Galerius and Maximin; the whole might
consequently amount to about fifteen hundred, a number which, if it is
equally divided between the ten years of the persecution, will allow an
annual consumption of one hundred and fifty martyrs. Allotting the same
proportion to the provinces of Italy, Africa, and perhaps Spain, where,
at the end of two or three years, the rigor of the penal laws was either
suspended or abolished, the multitude of Christians in the Roman empire,
on whom a capital punishment was inflicted by a judicia, sentence, will
be reduced to somewhat less than two thousand persons. Since it cannot
be doubted that the Christians were more numerous, and their enemies
more exasperated, in the time of Diocletian, than they had ever been in
any former persecution, this probable and moderate computation may teach
us to estimate the number of primitive saints and martyrs who sacrificed
their lives for the important purpose of introducing Christianity into
the world.</p></li>
<li><p>: Perhaps there never was an instance of an author committing so
deliberately the fault which he reprobates so strongly in others. What
is the dexterous management of the more inartificial historians of
Christianity, in exaggerating the numbers of the martyrs, compared to
the unfair address with which Gibbon here quietly dismisses from the
account all the horrible and excruciating tortures which fell short of
death? The reader may refer to the xiith chapter (book viii.) of
Eusebius for the description and for the scenes of these tortures. -

<li><p>But our ideas of greatness are of a relative nature: the
traveller, and especially the poet, who sailed along the Hellespont, who
pursued the windings of the stream, and contemplated the rural scenery,
which appeared on every side to terminate the prospect, insensibly lost
the remembrance of the sea; and his fancy painted those celebrated
straits, with all the attributes of a mighty river flowing with a swift
current, in the midst of a woody and inland country, and at length,
through a wide mouth, discharging itself into the Aegean or Archipelago.
^18 Ancient Troy, ^19 seated on a an eminence at the foot of Mount Ida,
overlooked the mouth of the Hellespont, which scarcely received an
accession of waters from the tribute of those immortal rivulets the
Simois and Scamander. The Grecian camp had stretched twelve miles along
the shore from the Sigaean to the Rhaetean promontory; and the flanks of
the army were guarded by the bravest chiefs who fought under the banners
of Agamemnon. The first of those promontories was occupied by Achilles
with his invincible myrmidons, and the dauntless Ajax pitched his tents
on the other. After Ajax had fallen a sacrifice to his disappointed
pride, and to the ingratitude of the Greeks, his sepulchre was erected
on the ground where he had defended the navy against the rage of Jove
and of Hector; and the citizens of the rising town of Rhaeteum
celebrated his memory with divine honors. ^20 Before Constantine gave a
just preference to the situation of Byzantium, he had conceived the
design of erecting the seat of empire on this celebrated spot, from
whence the Romans derived their fabulous origin. The extensive plain
which lies below ancient Troy, towards the Rhaetean promontory and the
tomb of Ajax, was first chosen for his new capital; and though the
undertaking was soon relinquished the stately remains of unfinished
walls and towers attracted the notice of all who sailed through the
straits of the Hellespont. ^21</p></li>
<li><p>: Gibbon does not allow greater width between the two nearest
points of the shores of the Hellespont than between those of the
Bosphorus; yet all the ancient writers speak of the Hellespontic strait
as broader than the other: they agree in giving it seven stadia in its
narrowest width, (Herod. in Melp. c. 85. Polym. c. 34. Strabo, p. 591.
Plin. iv. c. 12.) which make 875 paces. It is singular that Gibbon, who
in the fifteenth note of this chapter reproaches d’Anville with being
fond of supposing new and perhaps imaginary measures, has here adopted
the peculiar measurement which d’Anville has assigned to the stadium.
This great geographer believes that the ancients had a stadium of
fifty-one toises, and it is that which he applies to the walls of
Babylon. Now, seven of these stadia are equal to about 500 paces, 7
stadia = 2142 feet: 500 paces = 2135 feet 5 inches. - G. See Rennell,

<li><p>Some other regulations of this emperor are less liable to blame,
but they are less deserving of notice. He divided Constantinople into
fourteen regions or quarters, ^60 dignified the public council with the
appellation of senate, ^61 communicated to the citizens the privileges
of Italy, ^62 and bestowed on the rising city the title of Colony, the
first and most favored daughter of ancient Rome. The venerable parent
still maintained the legal and acknowledged supremacy, which was due to
her age, her dignity, and to the remembrance of her former greatness.

<li><p>: This was also at the expense of Rome. The emperor ordered that

<li><p>to the Imperial magazines, from whence they were occasionally
distributed for the use of the court, of the army, and of two capitals,
Rome and Constantinople. The commissioners of the revenue were so
frequently obliged to make considerable purchases, that they were
strictly prohibited from allowing any compensation, or from receiving in
money the value of those supplies which were exacted in kind. In the
primitive simplicity of small communities, this method may be well
adapted to collect the almost voluntary offerings of the people; but it
is at once susceptible of the utmost latitude, and of the utmost
strictness, which in a corrupt and absolute monarchy must introduce a
perpetual contest between the power of oppression and the arts of fraud.
^176 The agriculture of the Roman provinces was insensibly ruined, and,
in the progress of despotism which tends to disappoint its own purpose,
the emperors were obliged to derive some merit from the forgiveness of
debts, or the remission of tributes, which their subjects were utterly
incapable of paying. According to the new division of Italy, the fertile
and happy province of Campania, the scene of the early victories and of
the delicious retirements of the citizens of Rome, extended between the
sea and the Apennine, from the Tiber to the Silarus. Within sixty years
after the death of Constantine, and on the evidence of an actual survey,
an exemption was granted in favor of three hundred and thirty thousand
English acres of desert and uncultivated land; which amounted to one
eighth of the whole surface of the province. As the footsteps of the
Barbarians had not yet been seen in Italy, the cause of this amazing
desolation, which is recorded in the laws, can be ascribed only to the
administration of the Roman emperors. ^177</p></li>
<li><p>: It does not appear that the establishment of the indiction is
to be at tributed to Constantine: it existed before he had been created
Augustus at Rome, and the remission granted by him to the city of Autun
is the proof. He would not have ventured while only Caesar, and under
the necessity of courting popular favor, to establish such an odious
impost. Aurelius Victor and Lactantius agree in designating Diocletian
as the author of this despotic institution. Aur. Vict. de Caes. c. 39.

<li><p>: The proprietors were not charged with the expense of this
transport in the provinces situated on the sea-shore or near the great
rivers, there were companies of boatmen, and of masters of vessels, who
had this commission, and furnished the means of transport at their own
expense. In return, they were themselves exempt, altogether, or in part,
from the indiction and other imposts. They had certain privileges;
particular regulations determined their rights and obligations. (Cod.
Theod. l. xiii. tit. v. ix.) The transports by land were made in the
same manner, by the intervention of a privileged company called Bastaga;
the members were called Bastagarii Cod. Theod. l. viii. tit. v. -
G.]</p></li>
<li><p>Several indigent citizens contributed to compose a single head,
or share of taxation; while the wealthy provincial, in proportion to his
fortune, alone represented several of those imaginary beings. In a
poetical request, addressed to one of the last and most deserving of the
Roman princes who reigned in Gaul, Sidonius Apollinaris personifies his
tribute under the figure of a triple monster, the Geryon of the Grecian
fables, and entreats the new Hercules that he would most graciously be
pleased to save his life by cutting off three of his heads. ^181 The
fortune of Sidonius far exceeded the customary wealth of a poet; but if
he had pursued the allusion, he might have painted many of the Gallic
nobles with the hundred heads of the deadly Hydra, spreading over the
face of the country, and devouring the substance of a hundred families.
II. The difficulty of allowing an annual sum of about nine pounds
sterling, even for the average of the capitation of Gaul, may be
rendered more evident by the comparison of the present state of the same
country, as it is now governed by the absolute monarch of an
industrious, wealthy, and affectionate people. The taxes of France
cannot be magnified, either by fear or by flattery, beyond the annual
amount of eighteen millions sterling, which ought perhaps to be shared
among four and twenty millions of inhabitants. ^182 Seven millions of
these, in the capacity of fathers, or brothers, or husbands, may
discharge the obligations of the remaining multitude of women and
children; yet the equal proportion of each tributary subject will
scarcely rise above fifty shillings of our money, instead of a
proportion almost four times as considerable, which was regularly
imposed on their Gallic ancestors. The reason of this difference may be
found, not so much in the relative scarcity or plenty of gold and
silver, as in the different state of society, in ancient Gaul and in
modern France. In a country where personal freedom is the privilege of
every subject, the whole mass of taxes, whether they are levied on
property or on consumption, may be fairly divided among the whole body
of the nation. But the far greater part of the lands of ancient Gaul, as
well as of the other provinces of the Roman world, were cultivated by
slaves, or by peasants, whose dependent condition was a less rigid
servitude. ^183 In such a state the poor were maintained at the expense
of the masters who enjoyed the fruits of their labor; and as the rolls
of tribute were filled only with the names of those citizens who
possessed the means of an honorable, or at least of a decent
subsistence, the comparative smallness of their numbers explains and
justifies the high rate of their capitation. The truth of this assertion
may be illustrated by the following example: The Aedui, one of the most
powerful and civilized tribes or cities of Gaul, occupied an extent of
territory, which now contains about five hundred thousand inhabitants,
in the two ecclesiastical dioceses of Autun and Nevers; ^184 and with
the probable accession of those of Chalons and Macon, ^185 the
population would amount to eight hundred thousand souls. In the time of
Constantine, the territory of the Aedui afforded no more than
twenty-five thousand heads of capitation, of whom seven thousand were
discharged by that prince from the intolerable weight of tribute. ^186 A
just analogy would seem to countenance the opinion of an ingenious
historian, ^187 that the free and tributary citizens did not surpass the
number of half a million; and if, in the ordinary administration of
government, their annual payments may be computed at about four millions
and a half of our money, it would appear, that although the share of
each individual was four times as considerable, a fourth part only of
the modern taxes of France was levied on the Imperial province of Gaul.
The exactions of Constantius may be calculated at seven millions
sterling, which were reduced to two millions by the humanity or the
wisdom of Julian.</p></li>
<li><p>: Two masterly dissertations of M. Savigny, in the Mem. of the
Berlin Academy (1822 and 1823) have thrown new light on the taxation
system of the Empire. Gibbon, according to M. Savigny, is mistaken in
supposing that there was but one kind of capitation tax; there was a
land tax, and a capitation tax, strictly so called. The land tax was, in
its operation, a proprietor’s or landlord’s tax. But, besides this,
there was a direct capitation tax on all who were not possessed of
landed property. This tax dates from the time of the Roman conquests;
its amount is not clearly known. Gradual exemptions released different
persons and classes from this tax. One edict exempts painters. In Syria,
all under twelve or fourteen, or above sixty-five, were exempted; at a
later period, all under twenty, and all unmarried females; still later,
all under twenty-five, widows and nuns, soldiers, veterani and clerici -
whole dioceses, that of Thrace and Illyricum. Under Galerius and
Licinius, the plebs urbana became exempt; though this, perhaps, was only
an ordinance for the East. By degrees, however, the exemption was
extended to all the inhabitants of towns; and as it was strictly
capitatio plebeia, from which all possessors were exempted it fell at
length altogether on the coloni and agricultural slaves. These were
registered in the same cataster (capitastrum) with the land tax. It was
paid by the proprietor, who raised it again from his coloni and
laborers. - M.]</p></li>

arming their slaves, a hardy race of hunters and herdsmen, by whose
tumultuary aid they revenged their defeat, and expelled the invader from
their confines. But they soon discovered that they had exchanged a
foreign for a domestic enemy, more dangerous and more implacable.
Enraged by their former servitude, elated by their present glory, the
slaves, under the name of Limigantes, claimed and usurped the possession
of the country which they had saved. Their masters, unable to withstand
the ungoverned fury of the populace, preferred the hardships of exile to
the tyranny of their servants. Some of the fugitive Sarmatians solicited
a less ignominious dependence, under the hostile standard of the Goths.
A more numerous band retired beyond the Carpathian Mountains, among the
Quadi, their German allies, and were easily admitted to share a
superfluous waste of uncultivated land. But the far greater part of the
distressed nation turned their eyes towards the fruitful provinces of
Rome. Imploring the protection and forgiveness of the emperor, they
solemnly promised, as subjects in peace, and as soldiers in war, the
most inviolable fidelity to the empire which should graciously receive
them into its bosom. According to the maxims adopted by Probus and his

distributing honors and rewards among the faithful servants of the house
of Arsaces, and of proclaiming a general amnesty, which was accepted by
the greater part of the rebellious satraps. But the Romans derived more
honor than advantage from this revolution. Chosroes was a prince of a
puny stature and a pusillanimous spirit. Unequal to the fatigues of war,
averse to the society of mankind, he withdrew from his capital to a
retired palace, which he built on the banks of the River Eleutherus, and
in the centre of a shady grove; where he consumed his vacant hours in
the rural sports of hunting and hawking. To secure this inglorious ease,
he submitted to the conditions of peace which Sapor condescended to
impose; the payment of an annual tribute, and the restitution of the
fertile province of Atropatene, which the courage of Tiridates, and the
victorious arms of Galerius, had annexed to the Armenian monarchy.

<li><p>: Gibbon has endeavored, in his History, to make use of the
information furnished by Moses of Chorene, the only Armenian historian
then translated into Latin. Gibbon has not perceived all the
chronological difficulties which occur in the narrative of that writer.
He has not thought of all the critical discussions which his text ought
to undergo before it can be combined with the relations of the western
writers. From want of this attention, Gibbon has made the facts which he
has drawn from this source more erroneous than they are in the original.
This judgment applies to all which the English historian has derived
from the Armenian author. I have made the History of Moses a subject of
particular attention; and it is with confidence that I offer the
results, which I insert here, and which will appear in the course of my
notes. In order to form a judgment of the difference which exists
between me and Gibbon, I will content myself with remarking, that
throughout he has committed an anachronism of thirty years, from whence
it follows, that he assigns to the reign of Constantius many events
which took place during that of Constantine. He could not, therefore,
discern the true connection which exists between the Roman history and
that of Armenia, or form a correct notion of the reasons which induced
Constantine, at the close of his life, to make war upon the Persians, or
of the motives which detained Constantius so long in the East; he does
not even mention them. St. Martin, note on Le Beau, i. 406. I have
inserted M. St. Martin’s observations, but I must add, that the
chronology which he proposes, is not generally received by Armenian

<li><p>retired on the approach of Sapor, who passed the Tigris over
three bridges, and occupied near the village of Hilleh an advantageous
camp, which, by the labor of his numerous pioneers, he surrounded in one
day with a deep ditch and a lofty rampart. His formidable host, when it
was drawn out in order of battle, covered the banks of the river, the
adjacent heights, and the whole extent of a plain of above twelve miles,
which separated the two armies. Both were alike impatient to engage; but
the Barbarians, after a slight resistance, fled in disorder; unable to
resist, or desirous to weary, the strength of the heavy legions, who,
fainting with heat and thirst, pursued them across the plain, and cut in
pieces a line of cavalry, clothed in complete armor, which had been
posted before the gates of the camp to protect their retreat.
Constantius, who was hurried along in the pursuit, attempted, without
effect, to restrain the ardor of his troops, by representing to them the
dangers of the approaching night, and the certainty of completing their
success with the return of day. As they depended much more on their own
valor than on the experience or the abilities of their chief, they
silenced by their clamors his timid remonstrances; and rushing with fury
to the charge, filled up the ditch, broke down the rampart, and
dispersed themselves through the tents to recruit their exhausted
strength, and to enjoy the rich harvest of their labors. But the prudent
Sapor had watched the moment of victory. His army, of which the greater
part, securely posted on the heights, had been spectators of the action,
advanced in silence, and under the shadow of the night; and his Persian
archers, guided by the illumination of the camp, poured a shower of
arrows on a disarmed and licentious crowd. The sincerity of history ^61
declares, that the Romans were vanquished with a dreadful slaughter, and
that the flying remnant of the legions was exposed to the most
intolerable hardships. Even the tenderness of panegyric, confessing that
the glory of the emperor was sullied by the disobedience of his
soldiers, chooses to draw a veil over the circumstances of this
melancholy retreat. Yet one of those venal orators, so jealous of the
fame of Constantius, relates, with amazing coolness, an act of such
incredible cruelty, as, in the judgment of posterity, must imprint a far
deeper stain on the honor of the Imperial name. The son of Sapor, the
heir of his crown, had been made a captive in the Persian camp. The
unhappy youth, who might have excited the compassion of the most savage
enemy, was scourged, tortured, and publicly executed by the inhuman
Romans. ^62</p></li>

<li><p>The irresistible force of the waters was alternately fatal to the
contending parties, till at length a portion of the walls, unable to
sustain the accumulated pressure, gave way at once, and exposed an ample
breach of one hundred and fifty feet. The Persians were instantly driven
to the assault, and the fate of Nisibis depended on the event of the
day. The heavy-armed cavalry, who led the van of a deep column, were
embarrassed in the mud, and great numbers were drowned in the unseen
holes which had been filled by the rushing waters. The elephants, made
furious by their wounds, increased the disorder, and trampled down
thousands of the Persian archers. The Great King, who, from an exalted
throne, beheld the misfortunes of his arms, sounded, with reluctant
indignation, the signal of the retreat, and suspended for some hours the
prosecution of the attack. But the vigilant citizens improved the
opportunity of the night; and the return of day discovered a new wall of
six feet in height, rising every moment to fill up the interval of the
breach. Notwithstanding the disappointment of his hopes, and the loss of
more than twenty thousand men, Sapor still pressed the reduction of
Nisibis, with an obstinate firmness, which could have yielded only to
the necessity of defending the eastern provinces of Persia against a
formidable invasion of the Massagetae. ^67 Alarmed by this intelligence,
he hastily relinquished the siege, and marched with rapid diligence from
the banks of the Tigris to those of the Oxus. The danger and
difficulties of the Scythian war engaged him soon afterwards to
conclude, or at least to observe, a truce with the Roman emperor, which
was equally grateful to both princes; as Constantius himself, after the
death of his two brothers, was involved, by the revolutions of the West,
in a civil contest, which required and seemed to exceed the most
vigorous exertion of his undivided strength.</p></li>

<li><p>Different cities of Ionia and Bithynia were assigned for the
places of their exile and education; but as soon as their growing years
excited the jealousy of the emperor, he judged it more prudent to secure
those unhappy youths in the strong castle of Macellum, near Caesarea.
The treatment which they experienced during a six years’ confinement,
was partly such as they could hope from a careful guardian, and partly
such as they might dread from a suspicious tyrant. ^12 Their prison was
an ancient palace, the residence of the kings of Cappadocia; the
situation was pleasant, the buildings of stately, the enclosure
spacious. They pursued their studies, and practised their exercises,
under the tuition of the most skilful masters; and the numerous
household appointed to attend, or rather to guard, the nephews of
Constantine, was not unworthy of the dignity of their birth. But they
could not disguise to themselves that they were deprived of fortune, of
freedom, and of safety; secluded from the society of all whom they could
trust or esteem, and condemned to pass their melancholy hours in the
company of slaves devoted to the commands of a tyrant who had already
injured them beyond the hope of reconciliation. At length, however, the
emergencies of the state compelled the emperor, or rather his eunuchs,
to invest Gallus, in the twenty-fifth year of his age, with the title of
Caesar, and to cement this political connection by his marriage with the
princess Constantina. After a formal interview, in which the two princes
mutually engaged their faith never to undertake any thing to the
prejudice of each other, they repaired without delay to their respective
stations. Constantius continued his march towards the West, and Gallus
fixed his residence at Antioch; from whence, with a delegated authority,
he administered the five great dioceses of the eastern praefecture. ^13
In this fortunate change, the new Caesar was not unmindful of his
brother Julian, who obtained the honors of his rank, the appearances of
liberty, and the restitution of an ample patrimony. ^14</p></li>
<li><p>to visit and reform the state of the East. They were instructed
to behave towards Gallus with moderation and respect, and, by the
gentlest arts of persuasion, to engage him to comply with the invitation
of his brother and colleague. The rashness of the praefect disappointed
these prudent measures, and hastened his own ruin, as well as that of
his enemy. On his arrival at Antioch, Domitian passed disdainfully
before the gates of the palace, and alleging a slight pretence of
indisposition, continued several days in sullen retirement, to prepare
an inflammatory memorial, which he transmitted to the Imperial court.
Yielding at length to the pressing solicitations of Gallus, the praefect
condescended to take his seat in council; but his first step was to
signify a concise and haughty mandate, importing that the Caesar should
immediately repair to Italy, and threatening that he himself would
punish his delay or hesitation, by suspending the usual allowance of his
household. The nephew and daughter of Constantine, who could ill brook
the insolence of a subject, expressed their resentment by instantly
delivering Domitian to the custody of a guard. The quarrel still
admitted of some terms of accommodation. They were rendered
impracticable by the imprudent behavior of Montius, a statesman whose
arts and experience were frequently betrayed by the levity of his
disposition. ^20 The quaestor reproached Gallus in a haughty language,
that a prince who was scarcely authorized to remove a municipal
magistrate, should presume to imprison a Praetorian praefect; convoked a
meeting of the civil and military officers; and required them, in the
name of their sovereign, to defend the person and dignity of his
representatives. By this rash declaration of war, the impatient temper
of Gallus was provoked to embrace the most desperate counsels. He
ordered his guards to stand to their arms, assembled the populace of
Antioch, and recommended to their zeal the care of his safety and
revenge. His commands were too fatally obeyed. They rudely seized the
praefect and the quaestor, and tying their legs together with ropes,
they dragged them through the streets of the city, inflicted a thousand
insults and a thousand wounds on these unhappy victims, and at last
precipitated their mangled and lifeless bodies into the stream of the
Orontes. ^21</p></li>

the general Barbatio, with a select band of soldiers, who could neither
be moved by pity, nor corrupted by rewards, expected the arrival of his
illustrious victim. In the close of the evening he was arrested,
ignominiously stripped of the ensigns of Caesar, and hurried away to
Pola, ^! in Istria, a sequestered prison, which had been so recently
polluted with royal blood. The horror which he felt was soon increased
by the appearance of his implacable enemy the eunuch Eusebius, who, with
the assistance of a notary and a tribune, proceeded to interrogate him
concerning the administration of the East. The Caesar sank under the
weight of shame and guilt, confessed all the criminal actions and all
the treasonable designs with which he was charged; and by imputing them
to the advice of his wife, exasperated the indignation of Constantius,
who reviewed with partial prejudice the minutes of the examination. The
emperor was easily convinced, that his own safety was incompatible with
the life of his cousin: the sentence of death was signed, despatched,
and executed; and the nephew of Constantine, with his hands tied behind
his back, was beheaded in prison like the vilest malefactor. ^24 Those
who are inclined to palliate the cruelties of Constantius, assert that
he soon relented, and endeavored to recall the bloody mandate; but that
the second messenger, intrusted with the reprieve, was detained by the
eunuchs, who dreaded the unforgiving temper of Gallus, and were desirous
of reuniting to their empire the wealthy provinces of the East.

They rushed with fury to seize the person of the emperor; his royal
throne and golden couch were pillaged by these rude hands; but the
faithful defence of his guards, who died at his feet, allowed him a
moment to mount a fleet horse, and to escape from the confusion. The
disgrace which had been incurred by a treacherous surprise was soon
retrieved by the numbers and discipline of the Romans; and the combat
was only terminated by the extinction of the name and nation of the
Limigantes. The free Sarmatians were reinstated in the possession of
their ancient seats; and although Constantius distrusted the levity of
their character, he entertained some hopes that a sense of gratitude
might influence their future conduct. He had remarked the lofty stature
and obsequious demeanor of Zizais, one of the noblest of their chiefs.
He conferred on him the title of King; and Zizais proved that he was not
unworthy to reign, by a sincere and lasting attachment to the interests
of his benefactor, who, after this splendid success, received the name
of Sarmaticus from the acclamations of his victorious army. ^48</p></li>

<li><p>The satraps and generals were distributed according to their
several ranks, and the whole army, besides the numerous train of
Oriental luxury, consisted of more than one hundred thousand effective
men, inured to fatigue, and selected from the bravest nations of Asia.
The Roman deserter, who in some measure guided the councils of Sapor,
had prudently advised, that, instead of wasting the summer in tedious
and difficult sieges, he should march directly to the Euphrates, and
press forwards without delay to seize the feeble and wealthy metropolis
of Syria. But the Persians were no sooner advanced into the plains of
Mesopotamia, than they discovered that every precaution had been used
which could retard their progress, or defeat their design. The
inhabitants, with their cattle, were secured in places of strength, the
green forage throughout the country was set on fire, the fords of the
rivers were fortified by sharp stakes; military engines were planted on
the opposite banks, and a seasonable swell of the waters of the
Euphrates deterred the Barbarians from attempting the ordinary passage
of the bridge of Thapsacus. Their skilful guide, changing his plan of
operations, then conducted the army by a longer circuit, but through a
fertile territory, towards the head of the Euphrates, where the infant
river is reduced to a shallow and accessible stream. Sapor overlooked,
with prudent disdain, the strength of Nisibis; but as he passed under
the walls of Amida, he resolved to try whether the majesty of his
presence would not awe the garrison into immediate submission. The
sacrilegious insult of a random dart, which glanced against the royal
tiara, convinced him of his error; and the indignant monarch listened
with impatience to the advice of his ministers, who conjured him not to
sacrifice the success of his ambition to the gratification of his
resentment. The following day Grumbates advanced towards the gates with
a select body of troops, and required the instant surrender of the city,
as the only atonement which could be accepted for such an act of
rashness and insolence. His proposals were answered by a general
discharge, and his only son, a beautiful and valiant youth, was pierced
through the heart by a javelin, shot from one of the balistae. The
funeral of the prince of the Chionites was celebrated according to the
rites of the country; and the grief of his aged father was alleviated by
the solemn promise of Sapor, that the guilty city of Amida should serve
as a funeral pile to expiate the death, and to perpetuate the memory, of
his son.</p></li>

<li><p>to inscribe the shields of his soldiers with the celestial sign
of God, the sacred monogram of the name of Christ; that he executed the
commands of Heaven, and that his valor and obedience were rewarded by
the decisive victory of the Milvian Bridge. Some considerations might
perhaps incline a sceptical mind to suspect the judgment or the veracity
of the rhetorician, whose pen, either from zeal or interest, was devoted
to the cause of the prevailing faction. ^40 He appears to have published
his deaths of the persecutors at Nicomedia about three years after the
Roman victory; but the interval of a thousand miles, and a thousand
days, will allow an ample latitude for the invention of declaimers, the
credulity of party, and the tacit approbation of the emperor himself who
might listen without indignation to a marvellous tale, which exalted his
fame, and promoted his designs. In favor of Licinius, who still
dissembled his animosity to the Christians, the same author has provided
a similar vision, of a form of prayer, which was communicated by an
angel, and repeated by the whole army before they engaged the legions of
the tyrant Maximin. The frequent repetition of miracles serves to
provoke, where it does not subdue, the reason of mankind; ^41 but if the
dream of Constantine is separately considered, it may be naturally
explained either by the policy or the enthusiasm of the emperor. Whilst
his anxiety for the approaching day, which must decide the fate of the
empire, was suspended by a short and interrupted slumber, the venerable
form of Christ, and the well-known symbol of his religion, might
forcibly offer themselves to the active fancy of a prince who reverenced
the name, and had perhaps secretly implored the power, of the God of the
Christians. As readily might a consummate statesman indulge himself in
the use of one of those military stratagems, one of those pious frauds,
which Philip and Sertorius had employed with such art and effect. ^42
The praeternatural origin of dreams was universally admitted by the
nations of antiquity, and a considerable part of the Gallic army was
already prepared to place their confidence in the salutary sign of the
Christian religion. The secret vision of Constantine could be disproved
only by the event; and the intrepid hero who had passed the Alps and the
Apennine, might view with careless despair the consequences of a defeat
under the walls of Rome. The senate and people, exulting in their own
deliverance from an odious tyrant, acknowledged that the victory of
Constantine surpassed the powers of man, without daring to insinuate
that it had been obtained by the protection of the gods. The triumphal
arch, which was erected about three years after the event, proclaims, in
ambiguous language, that by the greatness of his own mind, and by an
instinct or impulse of the Divinity, he had saved and avenged the Roman
republic. ^43 The Pagan orator, who had seized an earlier opportunity of
celebrating the virtues of the conqueror, supposes that he alone enjoyed
a secret and intimate commerce with the Supreme Being, who delegated the
care of mortals to his subordinate deities; and thus assigns a very
plausible reason why the subjects of Constantine should not presume to
embrace the new religion of their sovereign. ^44</p></li>

and indefeasible right to the perpetual obedience of the clerk whom he
ordained: the clergy of each episcopal church, with its dependent
parishes, formed a regular and permanent society; and the cathedrals of
Constantinople ^97 and Carthage ^98 maintained their peculiar
establishment of five hundred ecclesiastical ministers. Their ranks ^99

which introduced into the church the splendid ceremonies of a Jewish or
Pagan temple; and a long train of priests, deacons, sub-deacons,
acolythes, exorcists, readers, singers, and doorkeepers, contributed, in
their respective stations, to swell the pomp and harmony of religious
worship. The clerical name and privileges were extended to many pious
fraternities, who devoutly supported the ecclesiastical throne. ^100 Six

t. ii. leg. 1, 2 Eusebius, Hist. Eccles. l. x. c. vii.) They sought,
also, to be exempted from those of the second, (munera patrimoniorum.)
The rich, to obtain this privilege, obtained subordinate situations
among the clergy. Constantine published in 320 an edict, by which he
prohibited the more opulent citizens (decuriones and curiales) from
embracing the ecclesiastical profession, and the bishops from admitting
new ecclesiastics, before a place should be vacant by the death of the
occupant, (Godefroy ad Cod. Theod.t. xii. t. i. de Decur.) Valentinian
the First, by a rescript still more general enacted that no rich citizen
should obtain a situation in the church, (De Episc 1. lxvii.) He also
enacted that ecclesiastics, who wished to be exempt from offices which
they were bound to discharge as proprietors, should be obliged to give
up their property to their relations. Cod Theodos l. xii t. i. leb. 49 -

<li><p>to exclude Athanasius from the most remote and sequestered
regions of the earth. Counts, praefects, tribunes, whole armies, were
successively employed to pursue a bishop and a fugitive; the vigilance
of the civil and military powers was excited by the Imperial edicts;
liberal rewards were promised to the man who should produce Athanasius,
either alive or dead; and the most severe penalties were denounced
against those who should dare to protect the public enemy. ^138 But the
deserts of Thebais were now peopled by a race of wild, yet submissive
fanatics, who preferred the commands of their abbot to the laws of their
sovereign. The numerous disciples of Antony and Pachonnus received the
fugitive primate as their father, admired the patience and humility with
which he conformed to their strictest institutions, collected every word
which dropped from his lips as the genuine effusions of inspired wisdom;
and persuaded themselves that their prayers, their fasts, and their
vigils, were less meritorious than the zeal which they expressed, and
the dangers which they braved, in the defence of truth and innocence.
^139 The monasteries of Egypt were seated in lonely and desolate places,
on the summit of mountains, or in the islands of the Nile; and the
sacred horn or trumpet of Tabenne was the well-known signal which
assembled several thousand robust and determined monks, who, for the
most part, had been the peasants of the adjacent country. When their
dark retreats were invaded by a military force, which it was impossible
to resist, they silently stretched out their necks to the executioner;
and supported their national character, that tortures could never wrest
from an Egyptian the confession of a secret which he was resolved not to
disclose. ^140 The archbishop of Alexandria, for whose safety they
eagerly devoted their lives, was lost among a uniform and
well-disciplined multitude; and on the nearer approach of danger, he was
swiftly removed, by their officious hands, from one place of concealment
to another, till he reached the formidable deserts, which the gloomy and
credulous temper of superstition had peopled with daemons and savage
monsters. The retirement of Athanasius, which ended only with the life
of Constantius, was spent, for the most part, in the society of the
monks, who faithfully served him as guards, as secretaries, and as
messengers; but the importance of maintaining a more intimate connection
with the Catholic party tempted him, whenever the diligence of the
pursuit was abated, to emerge from the desert, to introduce himself into
Alexandria, and to trust his person to the discretion of his friends and
adherents. His various adventures might have furnished the subject of a
very entertaining romance. He was once secreted in a dry cistern, which
he had scarcely left before he was betrayed by the treachery of a female
slave; ^141 and he was once concealed in a still more extraordinary
asylum, the house of a virgin, only twenty years of age, and who was
celebrated in the whole city for her exquisite beauty. At the hour of
midnight, as she related the story many years afterwards, she was
surprised by the appearance of the archbishop in a loose undress, who,
advancing with hasty steps, conjured her to afford him the protection
which he had been directed by a celestial vision to seek under her
hospitable roof. The pious maid accepted and preserved the sacred pledge
which was intrusted to her prudence and courage. Without imparting the
secret to any one, she instantly conducted Athanasius into her most
secret chamber, and watched over his safety with the tenderness of a
friend and the assiduity of a servant. As long as the danger continued,
she regularly supplied him with books and provisions, washed his feet,
managed his correspondence, and dexterously concealed from the eye of
suspicion this familiar and solitary intercourse between a saint whose
character required the most unblemished chastity, and a female whose
charms might excite the most dangerous emotions. ^142 During the six
years of persecution and exile, Athanasius repeated his visits to his
fair and faithful companion; and the formal declaration, that he saw the
councils of Rimini and Seleucia, ^143 forces us to believe that he was
secretly present at the time and place of their convocation. The
advantage of personally negotiating with his friends, and of observing
and improving the divisions of his enemies, might justify, in a prudent
statesman, so bold and dangerous an enterprise: and Alexandria was
connected by trade and navigation with every seaport of the
Mediterranean. From the depth of his inaccessible retreat the intrepid
primate waged an incessant and offensive war against the protector of
the Arians; and his seasonable writings, which were diligently
circulated and eagerly perused, contributed to unite and animate the
orthodox party. In his public apologies, which he addressed to the
emperor himself, he sometimes affected the praise of moderation; whilst
at the same time, in secret and vehement invectives, he exposed
Constantius as a weak and wicked prince, the executioner of his family,
the tyrant of the republic, and the Antichrist of the church. In the
height of his prosperity, the victorious monarch, who had chastised the
rashness of Gallus, and suppressed the revolt of Sylvanus, who had taken
the diadem from the head of Vetranio, and vanquished in the field the
legions of Magnentius, received from an invisible hand a wound, which he
could neither heal nor revenge; and the son of Constantine was the first
of the Christian princes who experienced the strength of those
principles, which, in the cause of religion, could resist the most
violent exertions ^144 of the civil power.</p></li>
<li><p>: These princes were called Aeizanas and Saiazanas. Athanasius
calls them the kings of Axum. In the superscription of his letter,
Constantius gives them no title. Mr. Salt, during his first journey in
Ethiopia, (in 1806,) discovered, in the ruins of Axum, a long and very
interesting inscription relating to these princes. It was erected to
commemorate the victory of Aeizanas over the Bougaitae, (St. Martin
considers them the Blemmyes, whose true name is Bedjah or Bodjah.)
Aeizanas is styled king of the Axumites, the Homerites, of Raeidan, of
the Ethiopians, of the Sabsuites, of Silea, of Tiamo, of the Bougaites.
and of Kaei. It appears that at this time the king of the Ethiopians
ruled over the Homerites, the inhabitants of Yemen. He was not yet a
Christian, as he calls himself son of the invincible Mars. Another
brother besides Saiazanas, named Adephas, is mentioned, though Aeizanas
seems to have been sole king. See St. Martin, note on Le Beau, ii. 151.

<li><p>only nineteen miles from Sirmium, before his enemies could
receive any certain intelligence that he had left the banks of the
Rhine. In the course of this long and rapid navigation, the mind of
Julian was fixed on the object of his enterprise; and though he accepted
the deputations of some cities, which hastened to claim the merit of an
early submission, he passed before the hostile stations, which were
placed along the river, without indulging the temptation of signalizing
a useless and ill-timed valor. The banks of the Danube were crowded on
either side with spectators, who gazed on the military pomp, anticipated
the importance of the event, and diffused through the adjacent country
the fame of a young hero, who advanced with more than mortal speed at
the head of the innumerable forces of the West. Lucilian, who, with the
rank of general of the cavalry, commanded the military powers of
Illyricum, was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful reports, which he
could neither reject nor believe. He had taken some slow and irresolute
measures for the purpose of collecting his troops, when he was surprised
by Dagalaiphus, an active officer, whom Julian, as soon as he landed at
Bononia, had pushed forwards with some light infantry. The captive
general, uncertain of his life or death, was hastily thrown upon a
horse, and conducted to the presence of Julian; who kindly raised him
from the ground, and dispelled the terror and amazement which seemed to
stupefy his faculties. But Lucilian had no sooner recovered his spirits,
than he betrayed his want of discretion, by presuming to admonish his
conqueror that he had rashly ventured, with a handful of men, to expose
his person in the midst of his enemies. “Reserve for your master
Constantius these timid remonstrances,“ replied Julian, with a smile of
contempt: “when I gave you my purple to kiss, I received you not as a
counsellor, but as a suppliant.“ Conscious that success alone could
justify his attempt, and that boldness only could command success, he
instantly advanced, at the head of three thousand soldiers, to attack
the strongest and most populous city of the Illyrian provinces. As he
entered the long suburb of Sirmium, he was received by the joyful
acclamations of the army and people; who, crowned with flowers, and
holding lighted tapers in their hands, conducted their acknowledged
sovereign to his Imperial residence. Two days were devoted to the public
joy, which was celebrated by the games of the circus; but, early on the
morning of the third day, Julian marched to occupy the narrow pass of
Succi, in the defiles of Mount Haemus; which, almost in the midway
between Sirmium and Constantinople, separates the provinces of Thrace
and Dacia, by an abrupt descent towards the former, and a gentle
declivity on the side of the latter. ^33 The defence of this important
post was intrusted to the brave Nevitta; who, as well as the generals of
the Italian division, successfully executed the plan of the march and
junction which their master had so ably conceived. ^34</p></li>

explanation of this remarkable incident, which the positive testimony of
Ammianus, a contemporary and a pagan, will not permit us to call in
question. It was suggested by a passage in Tacitus. That historian,
speaking of Jerusalem, says,</p></li>
<li><p>This explanation is confirmed by the relation of an event nearly
similar, by Josephus. King Herod having heard that immense treasures had
been concealed in the sepulchre of David, he descended into it with a
few confidential persons; he found in the first subterranean chamber
only jewels and precious stuffs: but having wished to penetrate into a
second chamber, which had been long closed, he was repelled, when he
opened it, by flames which killed those who accompanied him. (Ant. Jud.
xvi. 7, i.) As here there is no room for miracle, this fact may be
considered as a new proof of the veracity of that related by Ammianus
and the contemporary writers. - G. To the illustrations of the extent of
the subterranean chambers adduced by Michaelis, may be added, that when
John of Gischala, during the siege, surprised the Temple, the party of
Eleazar took refuge within them. Bell. Jud. vi. 3, i. The sudden sinking
of the hill of Sion when Jerusalem was occupied by Barchocab, may have
been connected with similar excavations. Hist. of Jews, vol. iii. 122

been long closed are opened, one of two things takes place; either the
torches are extinguished and the men fall first into a swoor and soon
die; or, if the air is inflammable, a little flame is seen to flicker
round the lamp, which spreads and multiplies till the conflagration
becomes general, is followed by an explosion, and kill all who are in
the way. - G.]</p></li>

^122 The fears of the Pagans were just, and their precautions
ineffectual. The meritorious death of the archbishop obliterated the

Arians, and the seeming conversion of those sectaries introduced his

twenty miles from the city of Hierapolis. The solemn rites of sacrifice
were decently prepared by the inhabitants of Batnae, who seemed attached
to the worship of their tutelar deities, Apollo and Jupiter; but the
serious piety of Julian was offended by the tumult of their applause;
and he too clearly discerned, that the smoke which arose from their
altars was the incense of flattery, rather than of devotion. The ancient
and magnificent temple which had sanctified, for so many ages, the city
of Hierapolis, ^31 no longer subsisted; and the consecrated wealth,
which afforded a liberal maintenance to more than three hundred priests,
might hasten its downfall. Yet Julian enjoyed the satisfaction of
embracing a philosopher and a friend, whose religious firmness had
withstood the pressing and repeated solicitations of Constantius and
Gallus, as often as those princes lodged at his house, in their passage
through Hierapolis. In the hurry of military preparation, and the
careless confidence of a familiar correspondence, the zeal of Julian
appears to have been lively and uniform. He had now undertaken an
important and difficult war; and the anxiety of the event rendered him
still more attentive to observe and register the most trifling presages,
from which, according to the rules of divination, any knowledge of
futurity could be derived. ^32 He informed Libanius of his progress as
far as Hierapolis, by an elegant epistle, ^33 which displays the
facility of his genius, and his tender friendship for the sophist of
Antioch.</p></li>

<li><p>situate almost on the banks of the Euphrates, ^34 had been
appointed for the general rendezvous of the Roman troops, who
immediately passed the great river on a bridge of boats, which was
previously constructed. ^35 If the inclinations of Julian had been
similar to those of his predecessor, he might have wasted the active and
important season of the year in the circus of Samosata or in the
churches of Edessa. But as the warlike emperor, instead of Constantius,
had chosen Alexander for his model, he advanced without delay to
Carrhae, ^36 a very ancient city of Mesopotamia, at the distance of
fourscore miles from Hierapolis. The temple of the Moon attracted the
devotion of Julian; but the halt of a few days was principally employed
in completing the immense preparations of the Persian war. The secret of
the expedition had hitherto remained in his own breast; but as Carrhae
is the point of separation of the two great roads, he could no longer
conceal whether it was his design to attack the dominions of Sapor on
the side of the Tigris, or on that of the Euphrates. The emperor
detached an army of thirty thousand men, under the command of his
kinsman Procopius, and of Sebastian, who had been duke of Egypt. They
were ordered to direct their march towards Nisibis, and to secure the
frontier from the desultory incursions of the enemy, before they
attempted the passage of the Tigris. Their subsequent operations were
left to the discretion of the generals; but Julian expected, that after
wasting with fire and sword the fertile districts of Media and Adiabene,
they might arrive under the walls of Ctesiphon at the same time that he
himself, advancing with equal steps along the banks of the Euphrates,
should besiege the capital of the Persian monarchy. The success of this
well-concerted plan depended, in a great measure, on the powerful and
ready assistance of the king of Armenia, who, without exposing the
safety of his own dominions, might detach an army of four thousand
horse, and twenty thousand foot, to the assistance of the Romans. ^37
But the feeble Arsaces Tiranus, ^38 king of Armenia, had degenerated
still more shamefully than his father Chosroes, from the manly virtues
of the great Tiridates; and as the pusillanimous monarch was averse to
any enterprise of danger and glory, he could disguise his timid
indolence by the more decent excuses of religion and gratitude. He
expressed a pious attachment to the memory of Constantius, from whose
hands he had received in marriage Olympias, the daughter of the praefect
Ablavius; and the alliance of a female, who had been educated as the
destined wife of the emperor Constans, exalted the dignity of a
Barbarian king. ^39 Tiranus professed the Christian religion; he reigned
over a nation of Christians; and he was restrained, by every principle
of conscience and interest, from contributing to the victory, which
would consummate the ruin of the church. The alienated mind of Tiranus
was exasperated by the indiscretion of Julian, who treated the king of
Armenia as his slave, and as the enemy of the gods. The haughty and
threatening style of the Imperial mandates ^40 awakened the secret
indignation of a prince, who, in the humiliating state of dependence,
was still conscious of his royal descent from the Arsacides, the lords
of the East, and the rivals of the Roman power. ^!</p></li>

<li><p>: Arsaces Tiranus, or Diran, had ceased to reign twenty- five
years before, in 337. The intermediate changes in Armenia, and the
character of this Arsaces, the son of Diran, are traced by M.
St. Martin, at considerable length, in his supplement to Le Beau, ii.
208-242. As long as his Grecian queen Olympias maintained her influence,
Arsaces was faithful to the Roman and Christian alliance. On the
accession of Julian, the same influence made his fidelity to waver; but
Olympias having been poisoned in the sacramental bread by the agency of
Pharandcem, the former wife of Arsaces, another change took place in
Armenian politics unfavorable to the Christian interest. The patriarch
Narses retired from the impious court to a safe seclusion. Yet
Pharandsem was equally hostile to the Persian influence, and Arsaces
began to support with vigor the cause of Julian. He made an inroad into
the Persian dominions with a body of Rans and Alans as auxiliaries;
wasted Aderbidgan and Sapor, who had been defeated near Tauriz, was
engaged in making head against his troops in Persarmenia, at the time of
the death of Julian. Such is M. St. Martin’s view, (ii. 276, et sqq.,)
which rests on the Armenian historians, Faustos of Byzantium, and Mezrob
the biographer of the Partriarch Narses. In the history of Armenia by
Father Chamitch, and translated by Avdall, Tiran is still king of
Armenia, at the time of Julian’s death. F. Chamitch follows Moses of
Chorene, The authority of Gibbon. - M.]</p></li>

<li><p>the extreme limit of the Roman dominions. The army of Julian, the
most numerous that any of the Caesars had ever led against Persia,
consisted of sixty-five thousand effective and well-disciplined
soldiers. The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry, of Romans and
Barbarians, had been selected from the different provinces; and a just
preeminence of loyalty and valor was claimed by the hardy Gauls, who
guarded the throne and person of their beloved prince. A formidable body
of Scythian auxiliaries had been transported from another climate, and
almost from another world, to invade a distant country, of whose name
and situation they were ignorant. The love of rapine and war allured to
the Imperial standard several tribes of Saracens, or roving Arabs, whose
service Julian had commanded, while he sternly refuse the payment of the
accustomed subsidies. The broad channel of the Euphrates ^41 was crowded
by a fleet of eleven hundred ships, destined to attend the motions, and
to satisfy the wants, of the Roman army. The military strength of the
fleet was composed of fifty armed galleys; and these were accompanied by
an equal number of flat-bottomed boats, which might occasionally be
connected into the form of temporary bridges. The rest of the ships,
partly constructed of timber, and partly covered with raw hides, were
laden with an almost inexhaustible supply of arms and engines, of
utensils and provisions. The vigilant humanity of Julian had embarked a
very large magazine of vinegar and biscuit for the use of the soldiers,
but he prohibited the indulgence of wine; and rigorously stopped a long
string of superfluous camels that attempted to follow the rear of the
army. The River Chaboras falls into the Euphrates at Circesium; ^42 and
as soon as the trumpet gave the signal of march, the Romans passed the
little stream which separated two mighty and hostile empires. The custom
of ancient discipline required a military oration; and Julian embraced
every opportunity of displaying his eloquence. He animated the impatient
and attentive legions by the example of the inflexible courage and
glorious triumphs of their ancestors. He excited their resentment by a
lively picture of the insolence of the Persians; and he exhorted them to
imitate his firm resolution, either to extirpate that perfidious nation,
or to devote his life in the cause of the republic. The eloquence of
Julian was enforced by a donative of one hundred and thirty pieces of
silver to every soldier; and the bridge of the Chaboras was instantly
cut away, to convince the troops that they must place their hopes of
safety in the success of their arms. Yet the prudence of the emperor
induced him to secure a remote frontier, perpetually exposed to the
inroads of the hostile Arabs. A detachment of four thousand men was left
at Circesium, which completed, to the number of ten thousand, the
regular garrison of that important fortress. ^43</p></li>

Hormisdas escaped with some difficulty from their hands. But the
Barbarians were finally repulsed; the country became every day less
favorable to the operations of cavalry; and when the Romans arrived at
Macepracta, they perceived the ruins of the wall, which had been
constructed by the ancient kings of Assyria, to secure their dominions
from the incursions of the Medes. These preliminaries of the expedition
of Julian appear to have employed about fifteen days; and we may compute
near three hundred miles from the fortress of Circesium to the wall of

wheat and barley, were produced with inexhaustible fertility; and the
husbandman, who committed his seed to the earth, was frequently rewarded
with an increase of two, or even of three, hundred. The face of the
country was interspersed with groves of innumerable palm-trees; ^55 and
the diligent natives celebrated, either in verse or prose, the three
hundred and sixty uses to which the trunk, the branches, the leaves, the
juice, and the fruit, were skilfully applied. Several manufactures,
especially those of leather and linen, employed the industry of a
numerous people, and afforded valuable materials for foreign trade;
which appears, however, to have been conducted by the hands of
strangers. Babylon had been converted into a royal park; but near the
ruins of the ancient capital, new cities had successively arisen, and
the populousness of the country was displayed in the multitude of towns
and villages, which were built of bricks dried in the sun, and strongly
cemented with bitumen; the natural and peculiar production of the
Babylonian soil. While the successors of Cyrus reigned over Asia, the
province of Syria alone maintained, during a third part of the year, the
luxurious plenty of the table and household of the Great King. Four
considerable villages were assigned for the subsistence of his Indian
dogs; eight hundred stallions, and sixteen thousand mares, were
constantly kept, at the expense of the country, for the royal stables;
and as the daily tribute, which was paid to the satrap, amounted to one
English bushe of silver, we may compute the annual revenue of Assyria at
more than twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling. ^56</p></li>
<li><p>: We are informed by Mr. Gibbon, that nature has denied to the
soil an climate of Assyria some of her choicest gifts, the vine, the
olive, and the fig-tree. This might have been the case ir the age of
Ammianus Marcellinus, but it is not so at the present day; and it is a
curious fact that the grape, the olive, and the fig, are the most common
fruits in the province, and may be seen in every garden. Macdonald

<li><p>or Anbar, held the second rank in the province; a city, large,
populous, and well fortified, surrounded with a double wall, almost
encompassed by a branch of the Euphrates, and defended by the valor of a
numerous garrison. The exhortations of Hormisdas were repulsed with
contempt; and the ears of the Persian prince were wounded by a just
reproach, that, unmindful of his royal birth, he conducted an army of
strangers against his king and country. The Assyrians maintained their
loyalty by a skilful, as well as vigorous, defence; till the lucky
stroke of a battering-ram, having opened a large breach, by shattering
one of the angles of the wall, they hastily retired into the
fortifications of the interior citadel. The soldiers of Julian rushed
impetuously into the town, and after the full gratification of every
military appetite, Perisabor was reduced to ashes; and the engines which
assaulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the smoking houses.
The contest was continued by an incessant and mutual discharge of
missile weapons; and the superiority which the Romans might derive from
the mechanical powers of their balistae and catapultae was
counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground on the side of the
besieged. But as soon as an Helepolis had been constructed, which could
engage on equal terms with the loftiest ramparts, the tremendous aspect
of a moving turret, that would leave no hope of resistance or mercy,
terrified the defenders of the citadel into an humble submission; and
the place was surrendered only two days after Julian first appeared
under the walls of Perisabor. Two thousand five hundred persons, of both
sexes, the feeble remnant of a flourishing people, were permitted to
retire; the plentiful magazines of corn, of arms, and of splendid
furniture, were partly distributed among the troops, and partly reserved
for the public service; the useless stores were destroyed by fire or
thrown into the stream of the Euphrates; and the fate of Amida was
revenged by the total ruin of Perisabor.</p></li>
<li><p>: Libanius says that it was a great city of Assyria, called after
the name of the reigning king. The orator of Antioch is not mistaken.
The Persians and Syrians called it Fyrouz Schapour or Fyrouz Schahbour;
in Persian, the victory of Schahpour. It owed that name to Sapor the
First. It was before called Anbar St. Martin, iii. 85. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>The fortifications were razed to the ground; and not a vestige
was left, that the city of Maogamalcha had ever existed. The
neighborhood of the capital of Persia was adorned with three stately
palaces, laboriously enriched with every production that could gratify
the luxury and pride of an Eastern monarch. The pleasant situation of
the gardens along the banks of the Tigris, was improved, according to
the Persian taste, by the symmetry of flowers, fountains, and shady
walks: and spacious parks were enclosed for the reception of the bears,
lions, and wild boars, which were maintained at a considerable expense
for the pleasure of the royal chase. The park walls were broken down,
the savage game was abandoned to the darts of the soldiers, and the
palaces of Sapor were reduced to ashes, by the command of the Roman
emperor. Julian, on this occasion, showed himself ignorant, or careless,
of the laws of civility, which the prudence and refinement of polished
ages have established between hostile princes. Yet these wanton ravages
need not excite in our breasts any vehement emotions of pity or
resentment. A simple, naked statue, finished by the hand of a Grecian
artist, is of more genuine value than all these rude and costly
monuments of Barbaric labor; and, if we are more deeply affected by the
ruin of a palace than by the conflagration of a cottage, our humanity
must have formed a very erroneous estimate of the miseries of human
life. ^57</p></li>
<li><p>: And as guilty of a double treachery, having first engaged to
surrender the city, and afterwards valiantly defended it. Gibbon,
perhaps, should have noticed this charge, though he may have rejected it

<li><p>were gradually unladen; and a select detachment, apparently
destined for some secret expedition, was ordered to stand to their arms
on the first signal. Julian disguised the silent anxiety of his own mind
with smiles of confidence and joy; and amused the hostile nations with
the spectacle of military games, which he insultingly celebrated under
the walls of Coche. The day was consecrated to pleasure; but, as soon as
the hour of supper was passed, the emperor summoned the generals to his
tent, and acquainted them that he had fixed that night for the passage
of the Tigris. They stood in silent and respectful astonishment; but,
when the venerable Sallust assumed the privilege of his age and
experience, the rest of the chiefs supported with freedom the weight of
his prudent remonstrances. ^68 Julian contented himself with observing,
that conquest and safety depended on the attempt; that instead of
diminishing, the number of their enemies would be increased, by
successive reenforcements; and that a longer delay would neither
contract the breadth of the stream, nor level the height of the bank.
The signal was instantly given, and obeyed; the most impatient of the
legionaries leaped into five vessels that lay nearest to the bank; and
as they plied their oars with intrepid diligence, they were lost, after
a few moments, in the darkness of the night. A flame arose on the
opposite side; and Julian, who too clearly understood that his foremost
vessels, in attempting to land, had been fired by the enemy, dexterously
converted their extreme danger into a presage of victory. “Our
fellow-soldiers,“ he eagerly exclaimed, “are already masters of the
bank; see - they make the appointed signal; let us hasten to emulate and
assist their courage.“ The united and rapid motion of a great fleet
broke the violence of the current, and they reached the eastern shore of
the Tigris with sufficient speed to extinguish the flames, and rescue
their adventurous companions. The difficulties of a steep and lofty
ascent were increased by the weight of armor, and the darkness of the
night. A shower of stones, darts, and fire, was incessantly discharged
on the heads of the assailants; who, after an arduous struggle, climbed
the bank and stood victorious upon the rampart. As soon as they
possessed a more equal field, Julian, who, with his light infantry, had
led the attack, ^69 darted through the ranks a skilful and experienced
eye: his bravest soldiers, according to the precepts of Homer, ^70 were
distributed in the front and rear: and all the trumpets of the Imperial
army sounded to battle. The Romans, after sending up a military shout,
advanced in measured steps to the animating notes of martial music;
launched their formidable javelins; and rushed forwards with drawn
swords, to deprive the Barbarians, by a closer onset, of the advantage
of their missile weapons. The whole engagement lasted above twelve
hours; till the gradual retreat of the Persians was changed into a
disorderly flight, of which the shameful example was given by the
principal leader, and the Surenas himself. They were pursued to the
gates of Ctesiphon; and the conquerors might have entered the dismayed
city, ^71 if their general, Victor, who was dangerously wounded with an
arrow, had not conjured them to desist from a rash attempt, which must
be fatal, if it were not successful. On their side, the Romans
acknowledged the loss of only seventy-five men; while they affirmed,
that the Barbarians had left on the field of battle two thousand five
hundred, or even six thousand, of their bravest soldiers. The spoil was
such as might be expected from the riches and luxury of an Oriental
camp; large quantities of silver and gold, splendid arms and trappings,
and beds and tables of massy silver. ^</p></li>

<li><p>was instantly repeated by the guards who surrounded the tent, and
passed, in a few minutes, to the extremities of the line. The new
prince, astonished with his own fortune was hastily invested with the
Imperial ornaments, and received an oath of fidelity from the generals,
whose favor and protection he so lately solicited. The strongest
recommendation of Jovian was the merit of his father, Count Varronian,
who enjoyed, in honorable retirement, the fruit of his long services. In
the obscure freedom of a private station, the son indulged his taste for
wine and women; yet he supported, with credit, the character of a
Christian ^102 and a soldier. Without being conspicuous for any of the
ambitious qualifications which excite the admiration and envy of
mankind, the comely person of Jovian, his cheerful temper, and familiar
wit, had gained the affection of his fellow-soldiers; and the generals
of both parties acquiesced in a popular election, which had not been
conducted by the arts of their enemies. The pride of this unexpected
elevation was moderated by the just apprehension, that the same day
might terminate the life and reign of the new emperor. The pressing
voice of necessity was obeyed without delay; and the first orders issued
by Jovian, a few hours after his predecessor had expired, were to
prosecute a march, which could alone extricate the Romans from their
actual distress. ^103</p></li>

clemency of his sovereign was not averse to signify the conditions on
which he would consent to spare and to dismiss the Caesar with the
relics of his captive army. ^! The hopes of safety subdued the firmness
of the Romans; the emperor was compelled, by the advice of his council,
and the cries of his soldiers, to embrace the offer of peace; ^!! and
the praefect Sallust was immediately sent, with the general Arinthaeus,
to understand the pleasure of the Great King. The crafty Persian
delayed, under various pretenses, the conclusion of the agreement;
started difficulties, required explanations, suggested expedients,
receded from his concessions, increased his demands, and wasted four
days in the arts of negotiation, till he had consumed the stock of
provisions which yet remained in the camp of the Romans. Had Jovian been
capable of executing a bold and prudent measure, he would have continued
his march, with unremitting diligence; the progress of the treaty would
have suspended the attacks of the Barbarians; and, before the expiration
of the fourth day, he might have safely reached the fruitful province of
Corduene, at the distance only of one hundred miles. ^110 The irresolute
emperor, instead of breaking through the toils of the enemy, expected
his fate with patient resignation; and accepted the humiliating
conditions of peace, which it was no longer in his power to refuse. The
five provinces beyond the Tigris, which had been ceded by the
grandfather of Sapor, were restored to the Persian monarchy. He
acquired, by a single article, the impregnable city of Nisibis; which
had sustained, in three successive sieges, the effort of his arms.
Singara, and the castle of the Moors, one of the strongest places of
Mesopotamia, were likewise dismembered from the empire. It was
considered as an indulgence, that the inhabitants of those fortresses
were permitted to retire with their effects; but the conqueror
rigorously insisted, that the Romans should forever abandon the king and
kingdom of Armenia. ^!!! A peace, or rather a long truce, of thirty
years, was stipulated between the hostile nations; the faith of the

but as the mind of the orator was never disconcerted by timid
perplexity, he was able, as often as the occasion prompted him, to
deliver his decided sentiments with bold and ready elocution. The laws
of martial discipline were the only laws that he had studied; and he was
soon distinguished by the laborious diligence, and inflexible severity,
with which he discharged and enforced the duties of the camp. In the
time of Julian he provoked the danger of disgrace, by the contempt which
he publicly expressed for the reigning religion; ^22 and it should seem,
from his subsequent conduct, that the indiscreet and unseasonable
freedom of Valentinian was the effect of military spirit, rather than of
Christian zeal. He was pardoned, however, and still employed by a prince
who esteemed his merit; ^23 and in the various events of the Persian
war, he improved the reputation which he had already acquired on the
banks of the Rhine. The celerity and success with which he executed an
important commission, recommended him to the favor of Jovian; and to the
honorable command of the second school, or company, of Targetiers, of
the domestic guards. In the march from Antioch, he had reached his
quarters at Ancyra, when he was unexpectedly summoned, without guilt and
without intrigue, to assume, in the forty-third year of his age, the
absolute government of the Roman empire.</p></li>

<li><p>and as the boldest patriots were convinced, that their
opposition, without being serviceable to their country, would be fatal
to themselves, the declaration of his absolute will was received with
silent submission. Valens was now in the thirty-sixth year of his age;
but his abilities had never been exercised in any employment, military
or civil; and his character had not inspired the world with any sanguine
expectations. He possessed, however, one quality, which recommended him
to Valentinian, and preserved the domestic peace of the empire; devout
and grateful attachment to his benefactor, whose superiority of genius,
as well as of authority, Valens humbly and cheerfully acknowledged in
every action of his life. ^28</p></li>

former basis; but a double supply of generals and magistrates was
required for two councils, and two courts: the division was made with a
just regard to their peculiar merit and situation, and seven
master-generals were soon created, either of the cavalry or infantry.
When this important business had been amicably transacted, Valentinian
and Valens embraced for the last time. The emperor of the West
established his temporary residence at Milan; and the emperor of the
East returned to Constantinople, to assume the dominion of fifty
provinces, of whose language he was totally ignorant. ^33</p></li>

<li><p>The usurper improved this unexpected success with some degree of
courage and dexterity. He artfully propagated the rumors and opinions
the most favorable to his interest; while he deluded the populace by
giving audience to the frequent, but imaginary, ambassadors of distant
nations. The large bodies of troops stationed in the cities of Thrace
and the fortresses of the Lower Danube, were gradually involved in the
guilt of rebellion: and the Gothic princes consented to supply the
sovereign of Constantinople with the formidable strength of several
thousand auxiliaries. His generals passed the Bosphorus, and subdued,
without an effort, the unarmed, but wealthy provinces of Bithynia and
Asia. After an honorable defence, the city and island of Cyzicus yielded
to his power; the renowned legions of the Jovians and Herculeans
embraced the cause of the usurper, whom they were ordered to crush; and,
as the veterans were continually augmented with new levies, he soon
appeared at the head of an army, whose valor, as well as numbers, were
not unequal to the greatness of the contest. The son of Hormisdas, ^37 a
youth of spirit and ability, condescended to draw his sword against the
lawful emperor of the East; and the Persian prince was immediately
invested with the ancient and extraordinary powers of a Roman Proconsul.
The alliance of Faustina, the widow of the emperor Constantius, who
intrusted herself and her daughter to the hands of the usurper, added
dignity and reputation to his cause. The princess Constantia, who was
then about five years of age, accompanied, in a litter, the march of the
army. She was shown to the multitude in the arms of her adopted father;
and, as often as she passed through the ranks, the tenderness of the
soldiers was inflamed into martial fury: ^38 they recollected the
glories of the house of Constantine, and they declared, with loyal
acclamation, that they would shed the last drop of their blood in the
defence of the royal infant. ^39</p></li>

<li><p>The difficulties of a German was forced him to confine his
immediate care to the safety of his own dominions; and, as every channel
of communication was stopped or corrupted, he listened, with doubtful
anxiety, to the rumors which were industriously spread, that the defeat
and death of Valens had left Procopius sole master of the Eastern
provinces. Valens was not dead: but on the news of the rebellion, which
he received at Caesarea, he basely despaired of his life and fortune;
proposed to negotiate with the usurper, and discovered his secret
inclination to abdicate the Imperial purple. The timid monarch was saved
from disgrace and ruin by the firmness of his ministers, and their
abilities soon decided in his favor the event of the civil war. In a
season of tranquillity, Sallust had resigned without a murmur; but as
soon as the public safety was attacked, he ambitiously solicited the
preeminence of toil and danger; and the restoration of that virtuous
minister to the praefecture of the East, was the first step which
indicated the repentance of Valens, and satisfied the minds of the
people. The reign of Procopius was apparently supported by powerful
armies and obedient provinces. But many of the principal officers,
military as well as civil, had been urged, either by motives of duty or
interest, to withdraw themselves from the guilty scene; or to watch the
moment of betraying, and deserting, the cause of the usurper. Lupicinus
advanced by hasty marches, to bring the legions of Syria to the aid of
Valens. Arintheus, who, in strength, beauty, and valor, excelled all the
heroes of the age, attacked with a small troop a superior body of the
rebels. When he beheld the faces of the soldiers who had served under
his banner, he commanded them, with a loud voice, to seize and deliver
up their pretended leader; and such was the ascendant of his genius,
that this extraordinary order was instantly obeyed. ^40 Arbetio, a
respectable veteran of the great Constantine, who had been distinguished
by the honors of the consulship, was persuaded to leave his retirement,
and once more to conduct an army into the field. In the heat of action,
calmly taking off his helmet, he showed his gray hairs and venerable
countenance: saluted the soldiers of Procopius by the endearing names of
children and companions, and exhorted them no longer to support the
desperate cause of a contemptible tyrant; but to follow their old
commander, who had so often led them to honor and victory. In the two
engagements of Thyatira ^41 and Nacolia, the unfortunate Procopius was
deserted by his troops, who were seduced by the instructions and example
of their perfidious officers. After wandering some time among the woods
and mountains of Phyrgia, he was betrayed by his desponding followers,
conducted to the Imperial camp, and immediately beheaded. He suffered
the ordinary fate of an unsuccessful usurper; but the acts of cruelty
which were exercised by the conqueror, under the forms of legal justice,
excited the pity and indignation of mankind. ^42</p></li>

common enemies of the state, Procopius the private foe of the Emperor;

instructed by that Arian pastor in the principles of heterodox theology,
his misfortune, rather than his guilt, was the inevitable consequence of
his erroneous choice. Whatever had been the determination of the
emperor, he must have offended a numerous party of his Christian
subjects; as the leaders both of the Homoousians and of the Arians
believed, that, if they were not suffered to reign, they were most
cruelly injured and oppressed. After he had taken this decisive step, it
was extremely difficult for him to preserve either the virtue, or the
reputation of impartiality. He never aspired, like Constantius, to the
fame of a profound theologian; but as he had received with simplicity
and respect the tenets of Euxodus, Valens resigned his conscience to the
direction of his ecclesiastical guides, and promoted, by the influence
of his authority, the reunion of the Athanasian heretics to the body of
the Catholic church. At first, he pitied their blindness; by degrees he
was provoked at their obstinacy; and he insensibly hated those sectaries
to whom he was an object of hatred. ^67 The feeble mind of Valens was
always swayed by the persons with whom he familiarly conversed; and the
exile or imprisonment of a private citizen are the favors the most
readily granted in a despotic court. Such punishments were frequently
inflicted on the leaders of the Homoousian party; and the misfortune of
fourscore ecclesiastics of Constantinople, who, perhaps accidentally,
were burned on shipboard, was imputed to the cruel and premeditated
malice of the emperor, and his Arian ministers. In every contest, the
Catholics (if we may anticipate that name) were obliged to pay the
penalty of their own faults, and of those of their adversaries. In every
election, the claims of the Arian candidate obtained the preference; and
if they were opposed by the majority of the people, he was usually
supported by the authority of the civil magistrate, or even by the
terrors of a military force. The enemies of Athanasius attempted to
disturb the last years of his venerable age; and his temporary retreat
to his father’s sepulchre has been celebrated as a fifth exile. But the
zeal of a great people, who instantly flew to arms, intimidated the
praefect: and the archbishop was permitted to end his life in peace and
in glory, after a reign of forty-seven years. The death of Athanasius
was the signal of the persecution of Egypt; and the Pagan minister of
Valens, who forcibly seated the worthless Lucius on the archiepiscopal
throne, purchased the favor of the reigning party, by the blood and
sufferings of their Christian brethren. The free toleration of the
heathen and Jewish worship was bitterly lamented, as a circumstance
which aggravated the misery of the Catholics, and the guilt of the
impious tyrant of the East. ^68</p></li>

the Alemanni, before they had time to run to their arms; and flushed his
soldiers with the confidence of an easy and bloodless victory. Another
division, or rather army, of the enemy, after the cruel and wanton
devastation of the adjacent country, reposed themselves on the shady
banks of the Moselle. Jovinus, who had viewed the ground with the eye of
a general, made a silent approach through a deep and woody vale, till he
could distinctly perceive the indolent security of the Germans. Some
were bathing their huge limbs in the river; others were combing their
long and flaxen hair; others again were swallowing large draughts of
rich and delicious wine. On a sudden they heard the sound of the Roman
trumpet; they saw the enemy in their camp. Astonishment produced
disorder; disorder was followed by flight and dismay; and the confused
multitude of the bravest warriors was pierced by the swords and javelins
of the legionaries and auxiliaries. The fugitives escaped to the third,
and most considerable, camp, in the Catalonian plains, near Chalons in
Champagne: the straggling detachments were hastily recalled to their
standard; and the Barbarian chiefs, alarmed and admonished by the fate
of their companions, prepared to encounter, in a decisive battle, the
victorious forces of the lieutenant of Valentinian. The bloody and
obstinate conflict lasted a whole summer’s day, with equal valor, and
with alternate success. The Romans at length prevailed, with the loss of
about twelve hundred men. Six thousand of the Alemanni were slain, four
thousand were wounded; and the brave Jovinus, after chasing the flying
remnant of their host as far as the banks of the Rhine, returned to
Paris, to receive the applause of his sovereign, and the ensigns of the
consulship for the ensuing year. ^91 The triumph of the Romans was
indeed sullied by their treatment of the captive king, whom they hung on
a gibbet, without the knowledge of their indignant general. This
disgraceful act of cruelty, which might be imputed to the fury of the
troops, was followed by the deliberate murder of Withicab, the son of
Vadomair; a German prince, of a weak and sickly constitution, but of a
daring and formidable spirit. The domestic assassin was instigated and
protected by the Romans; ^92 and the violation of the laws of humanity
and justice betrayed their secret apprehension of the weakness of the
declining empire. The use of the dagger is seldom adopted in public
councils, as long as they retain any confidence in the power of the

<li><p>Rando, a bold and artful chieftain, who had long meditated his
attempt, suddenly passed the Rhine; entered the defenceless town, and
retired with a multitude of captives of either sex. Valentinian resolved
to execute severe vengeance on the whole body of the nation. Count
Sebastian, with the bands of Italy and Illyricum, was ordered to invade
their country, most probably on the side of Rhaetia. The emperor in
person, accompanied by his son Gratian, passed the Rhine at the head of
a formidable army, which was supported on both flanks by Jovinus and
Severus, the two masters-general of the cavalry and infantry of the
West. The Alemanni, unable to prevent the devastation of their villages,
fixed their camp on a lofty, and almost inaccessible, mountain, in the
modern duchy of Wirtemberg, and resolutely expected the approach of the
Romans. The life of Valentinian was exposed to imminent danger by the
intrepid curiosity with which he persisted to explore some secret and
unguarded path. A troop of Barbarians suddenly rose from their
ambuscade: and the emperor, who vigorously spurred his horse down a
steep and slippery descent, was obliged to leave behind him his
armor-bearer, and his helmet, magnificently enriched with gold and
precious stones. At the signal of the general assault, the Roman troops
encompassed and ascended the mountain of Solicinium on three different
sides. ^! Every step which they gained, increased their ardor, and
abated the resistance of the enemy: and after their united forces had
occupied the summit of the hill, they impetuously urged the Barbarians
down the northern descent, where Count Sebastian was posted to intercept
their retreat. After this signal victory, Valentinian returned to his
winter quarters at Treves; where he indulged the public joy by the
exhibition of splendid and triumphal games. ^93 But the wise monarch,
instead of aspiring to the conquest of Germany, confined his attention

an enemy whose strength was renewed by a stream of daring volunteers,
which incessantly flowed from the most distant tribes of the North. ^94
The banks of the Rhine ^!! from its source to the straits of the ocean,
were closely planted with strong castles and convenient towers; new
works, and new arms, were invented by the ingenuity of a prince who was
skilled in the mechanical arts; and his numerous levies of Roman and
Barbarian youth were severely trained in all the exercises of war. The
progress of the work, which was sometimes opposed by modest
representations, and sometimes by hostile attempts, secured the
tranquillity of Gaul during the nine subsequent years of the
administration of Valentinian. ^95</p></li>

<li><p>The whole difficulty, however, is at once removed, if we apply to
the German nations, at that time, a fact which is so generally known to
have occurred in America, and suppose that, when not checked by wars and
famine, they increased at a rate that would double their numbers in
twenty-five or thirty years. The propriety, and even the necessity, of
applying this rate of increase to the inhabitants of ancient Germany,
will strikingly appear from that most valuable picture of their manners
which has been left us by Tacitus, (Tac. de Mor. Germ. 16 to
20.)</p></li>

<li><p>of the Vandal race, ^96 whose obscure name insensibly swelled
into a powerful kingdom, and has finally settled on a flourishing
province. The most remarkable circumstance in the ancient manners of the
Burgundians appears to have been the difference of their civil and
ecclesiastical constitution. The appellation of Hendinos was given to
the king or general, and the title of Sinistus to the high priest, of
the nation. The person of the priest was sacred, and his dignity
perpetual; but the temporal government was held by a very precarious
tenure. If the events of war accuses the courage or conduct of the king,
he was immediately deposed; and the injustice of his subjects made him
responsible for the fertility of the earth, and the regularity of the
seasons, which seemed to fall more properly within the sacerdotal
department. ^97 The disputed possession of some salt-pits ^98 engaged
the Alemanni and the Burgundians in frequent contests: the latter were
easily tempted, by the secret solicitations and liberal offers of the
emperor; and their fabulous descent from the Roman soldiers, who had
formerly been left to garrison the fortresses of Drusus, was admitted
with mutual credulity, as it was conducive to mutual interest. ^99 An
army of fourscore thousand Burgundians soon appeared on the banks of the
Rhine; and impatiently required the support and subsidies which
Valentinian had promised: but they were amused with excuses and delays,
till at length, after a fruitless expectation, they were compelled to
retire. The arms and fortifications of the Gallic frontier checked the
fury of their just resentment; and their massacre of the captives served
to imbitter the hereditary feud of the Burgundians and the Alemanni. The
inconstancy of a wise prince may, perhaps, be explained by some
alteration of circumstances; and perhaps it was the original design of
Valentinian to intimidate, rather than to destroy; as the balance of
power would have been equally overturned by the extirpation of either of
the German nations. Among the princes of the Alemanni, Macrianus, who,
with a Roman name, had assumed the arts of a soldier and a statesman,
deserved his hatred and esteem. The emperor himself, with a light and
unencumbered band, condescended to pass the Rhine, marched fifty miles
into the country, and would infallibly have seized the object of his
pursuit, if his judicious measures had not been defeated by the
impatience of the troops. Macrianus was afterwards admitted to the honor
of a personal conference with the emperor; and the favors which he
received, fixed him, till the hour of his death, a steady and sincere
friend of the republic. ^100</p></li>
<li><p>: According to the general opinion, the Burgundians formed a
Gothic o Vandalic tribe, who, from the banks of the Lower Vistula, made
incursions, on one side towards Transylvania, on the other towards the
centre of Germany. All that remains of the Burgundian language is
Gothic.</p></li>

<li><p>The kingdom of Armenia was reduced to the state of a Persian
province; the administration was shared between a distinguished satrap
and a favorite eunuch; and Sapor marched, without delay, to subdue the
martial spirit of the Iberians. Sauromaces, who reigned in that country
by the permission of the emperors, was expelled by a superior force;
and, as an insult on the majesty of Rome, the king of kings placed a
diadem on the head of his abject vassal Aspacuras. The city of
Artogerassa ^134 was the only place of Armenia ^!! which presumed to
resist the efforts of his arms. The treasure deposited in that strong
fortress tempted the avarice of Sapor; but the danger of Olympias, the
wife or widow of the Armenian king, excited the public compassion, and
animated the desperate valor of her subjects and soldiers. ^!!! The
Persians were surprised and repulsed under the walls of Artogerassa, by
a bold and well-concerted sally of the besieged. But the forces of Sapor
were continually renewed and increased; the hopeless courage of the
garrison was exhausted; the strength of the walls yielded to the
assault; and the proud conqueror, after wasting the rebellious city with
fire and sword, led away captive an unfortunate queen; who, in a more
auspicious hour, had been the destined bride of the son of Constantine.
^135 Yet if Sapor already triumphed in the easy conquest of two
dependent kingdoms, he soon felt, that a country is unsubdued as long as
the minds of the people are actuated by a hostile and contumacious
spirit. The satraps, whom he was obliged to trust, embraced the first
opportunity of regaining the affection of their countrymen, and of
signalizing their immortal hatred to the Persian name. Since the
conversion of the Armenians and Iberians, these nations considered the
Christians as the favorites, and the Magians as the adversaries, of the
Supreme Being: the influence of the clergy, over a superstitious people
was uniformly exerted in the cause of Rome; and as long as the
successors of Constantine disputed with those of Artaxerxes the
sovereignty of the intermediate provinces, the religious connection
always threw a decisive advantage into the scale of the empire. A
numerous and active party acknowledged Para, the son of Tiranus, as the
lawful sovereign of Armenia, and his title to the throne was deeply
rooted in the hereditary succession of five hundred years. By the
unanimous consent of the Iberians, the country was equally divided
between the rival princes; and Aspacuras, who owed his diadem to the
choice of Sapor, was obliged to declare, that his regard for his
children, who were detained as hostages by the tyrant, was the only
consideration which prevented him from openly renouncing the alliance of
Persia. The emperor Valens, who respected the obligations of the treaty,
and who was apprehensive of involving the East in a dangerous war,
ventured, with slow and cautious measures, to support the Roman party in
the kingdoms of Iberia and Armenia. ^!!!! Twelve legions established the
authority of Sauromaces on the banks of the Cyrus. The Euphrates was
protected by the valor of Arintheus. A powerful army, under the command
of Count Trajan, and of Vadomair, king of the Alemanni, fixed their camp
on the confines of Armenia. But they were strictly enjoined not to
commit the first hostilities, which might be understood as a breach of
the treaty: and such was the implicit obedience of the Roman general,
that they retreated, with exemplary patience, under a shower of Persian
arrows till they had clearly acquired a just title to an honorable and
legitimate victory. Yet these appearances of war insensibly subsided in
a vain and tedious negotiation. The contending parties supported their
claims by mutual reproaches of perfidy and ambition; and it should seem,
that the original treaty was expressed in very obscure terms, since they
were reduced to the necessity of making their inconclusive appeal to the
partial testimony of the generals of the two nations, who had assisted
at the negotiations. ^136 The invasion of the Goths and Huns which soon
afterwards shook the foundations of the Roman empire, exposed the
provinces of Asia to the arms of Sapor. But the declining age, and
perhaps the infirmities, of the monarch suggested new maxims of
tranquillity and moderation. His death, which happened in the full
maturity of a reign of seventy years, changed in a moment the court and
councils of Persia; and their attention was most probably engaged by
domestic troubles, and the distant efforts of a Carmanian war. ^137 The
remembrance of ancient injuries was lost in the enjoyment of peace. The
kingdoms of Armenia and Iberia were permitted, by the mutual,though
tacit consent of both empires, to resume their doubtful neutrality. In
the first years of the reign of Theodosius, a Persian embassy arrived at
Constantinople, to excuse the unjustifiable measures of the former
reign; and to offer, as the tribute of friendship, or even of respect, a
splendid present of gems, of silk, and of Indian elephants.

<li><p>: According to M. St. Martin, Sapor, though supported by the two
apostate Armenian princes, Meroujan the Ardzronnian and Vahan the
Mamigonian, was gallantly resisted by Arsaces, and his brave though
impious wife Pharandsem. His troops were defeated by Vasag, the high
constable of the kingdom. (See M. St. Martin.) But after four years’
courageous defence of his kingdom, Arsaces was abandoned by his nobles,
and obliged to accept the perfidious hospitality of Sapor. He was
blinded and imprisoned in the “Castle of Oblivion;“ his brave general
Vasag was flayed alive; his skin stuffed and placed near the king in his
lonely prison. It was not till many years after (A.D. 371) that he
stabbed himself, according to the romantic story, (St. M. iii. 387,
389,) in a paroxysm of excitement at his restoration to royal honors.

<li><p>and the ministers of Valens were satisfied, that they preserved
the integrity of the public faith, if their vassal was not suffered to
assume the diadem and title of King. But they soon repented of their own
rashness. They were confounded by the reproaches and threats of the
Persian monarch. They found reason to distrust the cruel and inconstant
temper of Para himself; who sacrificed, to the slightest suspicions, the
lives of his most faithful servants, and held a secret and disgraceful
correspondence with the assassin of his father and the enemy of his
country. Under the specious pretence of consulting with the emperor on
the subject of their common interest, Para was persuaded to descend from
the mountains of Armenia, where his party was in arms, and to trust his
independence and safety to the discretion of a perfidious court. The
king of Armenia, for such he appeared in his own eyes and in those of
his nation, was received with due honors by the governors of the
provinces through which he passed; but when he arrived at Tarsus in
Cilicia, his progress was stopped under various pretences; his motions
were watched with respectful vigilance, and he gradually discovered,
that he was a prisoner in the hands of the Romans. Para suppressed his
indignation, dissembled his fears, and after secretly preparing his
escape, mounted on horseback with three hundred of his faithful
followers. The officer stationed at the door of his apartment
immediately communicated his flight to the consular of Cilicia, who
overtook him in the suburbs, and endeavored without success, to dissuade
him from prosecuting his rash and dangerous design. A legion was ordered
to pursue the royal fugitive; but the pursuit of infantry could not be
very alarming to a body of light cavalry; and upon the first cloud of
arrows that was discharged into the air, they retreated with
precipitation to the gates of Tarsus. After an incessant march of two
days and two nights, Para and his Armenians reached the banks of the
Euphrates; but the passage of the river which they were obliged to swim,
^</p></li>
<li><p>was attended with some delay and some loss. The country was
alarmed; and the two roads, which were only separated by an interval of
three miles had been occupied by a thousand archers on horseback, under
the command of a count and a tribune. Para must have yielded to superior
force, if the accidental arrival of a friendly traveller had not
revealed the danger and the means of escape. A dark and almost
impervious path securely conveyed the Armenian troop through the
thicket; and Para had left behind him the count and the tribune, while
they patiently expected his approach along the public highways. They
returned to the Imperial court to excuse their want of diligence or
success; and seriously alleged, that the king of Armenia, who was a
skilful magician, had transformed himself and his followers, and passed
before their eyes under a borrowed shape. ^! After his return to his
native kingdom, Para still continued to profess himself the friend and
ally of the Romans: but the Romans had injured him too deeply ever to
forgive, and the secret sentence of his death was signed in the council
of Valens. The execution of the bloody deed was committed to the subtle
prudence of Count Trajan; and he had the merit of insinuating himself
into the confidence of the credulous prince, that he might find an
opportunity of stabbing him to the heart Para was invited to a Roman
banquet, which had been prepared with all the pomp and sensuality of the
East; the hall resounded with cheerful music, and the company was
already heated with wine; when the count retired for an instant, drew
his sword, and gave the signal of the murder. A robust and desperate
Barbarian instantly rushed on the king of Armenia; and though he bravely
defended his life with the first weapon that chance offered to his hand,
the table of the Imperial general was stained with the royal blood of a
guest, and an ally. Such were the weak and wicked maxims of the Roman
administration, that, to attain a doubtful object of political interest
the laws of nations, and the sacred rights of hospitality were inhumanly
violated in the face of the world. ^139</p></li>

<li><p>Their manners were softened, and even their features were
insensibly improved, by the mildness of the climate, and their long
residence in a flourishing province, ^46 which might still retain a
faint impression of the arts of Greece. ^47 The white Huns, a name which
they derived from the change of their complexions, soon abandoned the
pastoral life of Scythia. Gorgo, which, under the appellation of
Carizme, has since enjoyed a temporary splendor, was the residence of
the king, who exercised a legal authority over an obedient people. Their
luxury was maintained by the labor of the Sogdians; and the only vestige
of their ancient barbarism, was the custom which obliged all the
companions, perhaps to the number of twenty, who had shared the
liberality of a wealthy lord, to be buried alive in the same grave. ^48
The vicinity of the Huns to the provinces of Persia, involved them in
frequent and bloody contests with the power of that monarchy. But they
respected, in peace, the faith of treaties; in war, she dictates of
humanity; and their memorable victory over Peroses, or Firuz, displayed
the moderation, as well as the valor, of the Barbarians. The second
division of their countrymen, the Huns, who gradually advanced towards
the North-west, were exercised by the hardships of a colder climate, and
a more laborious march. Necessity compelled them to exchange the silks
of China for the furs of Siberia; the imperfect rudiments of civilized
life were obliterated; and the native fierceness of the Huns was
exasperated by their intercourse with the savage tribes, who were
compared, with some propriety, to the wild beasts of the desert. Their
independent spirit soon rejected the hereditary succession of the
Tanjous; and while each horde was governed by its peculiar mursa, their
tumultuary council directed the public measures of the whole nation. As
late as the thirteenth century, their transient residence on the eastern
banks of the Volga was attested by the name of Great Hungary. ^49 In the
winter, they descended with their flocks and herds towards the mouth of
that mighty river; and their summer excursions reached as high as the
latitude of Saratoff, or perhaps the conflux of the Kama. Such at least
were the recent limits of the black Calmucks, ^50 who remained about a
century under the protection of Russia; and who have since returned to
their native seats on the frontiers of the Chinese empire. The march,
and the return, of those wandering Tartars, whose united camp consists
of fifty thousand tents or families, illustrate the distant emigrations
of the ancient Huns. ^51</p></li>

<li><p>to whiten their swarthy complexions, and to tinge their hair with
a yellowish cast, which is seldom found in the Tartar race. They were
less deformed in their persons, less brutish in their manners, than the
Huns; but they did not yield to those formidable Barbarians in their
martial and independent spirit; in the love of freedom, which rejected
even the use of domestic slaves; and in the love of arms, which
considered war and rapine as the pleasure and the glory of mankind. A
naked cimeter, fixed in the ground, was the only object of their
religious worship; the scalps of their enemies formed the costly
trappings of their horses; and they viewed, with pity and contempt, the
pusillanimous warriors, who patiently expected the infirmities of age,
and the tortures of lingering disease. ^54 On the banks of the Tanais,
the military power of the Huns and the Alani encountered each other with
equal valor, but with unequal success. The Huns prevailed in the bloody
contest; the king of the Alani was slain; and the remains of the
vanquished nation were dispersed by the ordinary alternative of flight
or submission. ^55 A colony of exiles found a secure refuge in the
mountains of Caucasus, between the Euxine and the Caspian, where they
still preserve their name and their independence. Another colony
advanced, with more intrepid courage, towards the shores of the Baltic;
associated themselves with the Northern tribes of Germany; and shared
the spoil of the Roman provinces of Gaul and Spain. But the greatest
part of the nation of the Alani embraced the offers of an honorable and
advantageous union; and the Huns, who esteemed the valor of their less
fortunate enemies, proceeded, with an increase of numbers and
confidence, to invade the limits of the Gothic empire.</p></li>
<li><p>: Compare M. Klaproth’s curious speculations on the Alani. He
supposes them to have been the people, known by the Chinese, at the time
of their first expeditions to the West, under the name of Yath-sai or
A-lanna, the Alanan of Persian tradition, as preserved in Ferdusi; the
same, according to Ammianus, with the Massagetae, and with the Albani.
The remains of the nation still exist in the Ossetae of Mount Caucasus.

<li><p>These savages of Scythia were compared (and the picture had some
resemblance) to the animals who walk very awkwardly on two legs and to
the misshapen figures, the Termini, which were often placed on the
bridges of antiquity. They were distinguished from the rest of the human
species by their broad shoulders, flat noses, and small black eyes,
deeply buried in the head; and as they were almost destitute of beards,
they never enjoyed either the manly grace of youth, or the venerable
aspect of age. ^57 A fabulous origin was assigned, worthy of their form
and manners; that the witches of Scythia, who, for their foul and deadly
practices, had been driven from society, had copulated in the desert
with infernal spirits; and that the Huns were the offspring of this
execrable conjunction. ^58 The tale, so full of horror and absurdity,
was greedily embraced by the credulous hatred of the Goths; but, while
it gratified their hatred, it increased their fear, since the posterity
of daemons and witches might be supposed to inherit some share of the
praeternatural powers, as well as of the malignant temper, of their
parents. Against these enemies, Hermanric prepared to exert the united
forces of the Gothic state; but he soon discovered that his vassal
tribes, provoked by oppression, were much more inclined to second, than
to repel, the invasion of the Huns. One of the chiefs of the Roxolani
^59 had formerly deserted the standard of Hermanric, and the cruel
tyrant had condemned the innocent wife of the traitor to be torn asunder
by wild horses. The brothers of that unfortunate woman seized the
favorable moment of revenge.</p></li>
<li><p>: Art added to their native ugliness; in fact, it is difficult to
ascribe the proper share in the features of this hideous picture to
nature, to the barbarous skill with which they were self-disfigured, or
to the terror and hatred of the Romans. Their noses were flattened by
their nurses, their cheeks were gashed by an iron instrument, that the
scars might look more fearful, and prevent the growth of the beard.

<li><p>: The most probable opinion as to the position of this land is
that of M. Malte-Brun. He thinks that Caucaland is the territory of the
Cacoenses, placed by Ptolemy (l. iii. c. 8) towards the Carpathian
Mountains, on the side of the present Transylvania, and therefore the
canton of Cacava, to the south of Hermanstadt, the capital of the
principality. Caucaland it is evident, is the Gothic form of these

<li><p>who impatiently expected from the mouth of Valens an answer that
must finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen. The emperor
of the East was no longer guided by the wisdom and authority of his
elder brother, whose death happened towards the end of the preceding
year; and as the distressful situation of the Goths required an instant
and peremptory decision, he was deprived of the favorite resources of
feeble and timid minds, who consider the use of dilatory and ambiguous
measures as the most admirable efforts of consummate prudence. As long
as the same passions and interests subsist among mankind, the questions
of war and peace, of justice and policy, which were debated in the
councils of antiquity, will frequently present themselves as the subject
of modern deliberation. But the most experienced statesman of Europe has
never been summoned to consider the propriety, or the danger, of
admitting, or rejecting, an innumerable multitude of Barbarians, who are
driven by despair and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories
of a civilized nation. When that important proposition, so essentially
connected with the public safety, was referred to the ministers of
Valens, they were perplexed and divided; but they soon acquiesced in the
flattering sentiment which seemed the most favorable to the pride, the
indolence, and the avarice of their sovereign. The slaves, who were
decorated with the titles of praefects and generals, dissembled or
disregarded the terrors of this national emigration; so extremely
different from the partial and accidental colonies, which had been
received on the extreme limits of the empire. But they applauded the
liberality of fortune, which had conducted, from the most distant
countries of the globe, a numerous and invincible army of strangers, to
defend the throne of Valens; who might now add to the royal treasures
the immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to compensate their
annual proportion of recruits. The prayers of the Goths were granted,
and their service was accepted by the Imperial court: and orders were
immediately despatched to the civil and military governors of the
Thracian diocese, to make the necessary preparations for the passage and
subsistence of a great people, till a proper and sufficient territory
could be allotted for their future residence. The liberality of the
emperor was accompanied, however, with two harsh and rigorous
conditions, which prudence might justify on the side of the Romans; but
which distress alone could extort from the indignant Goths. Before they
passed the Danube, they were required to deliver their arms: and it was
insisted, that their children should be taken from them, and dispersed
through the provinces of Asia; where they might be civilized by the arts
of education, and serve as hostages to secure the fidelity of their
parents.</p></li>

of these ambassadors. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>But the stipulation, the most offensive to the Goths, and the
most important to the Romans, was shamefully eluded. The Barbarians, who
considered their arms as the ensigns of honor and the pledges of safety,
were disposed to offer a price, which the lust or avarice of the
Imperial officers was easily tempted to accept. To preserve their arms,
the haughty warriors consented, with some reluctance, to prostitute
their wives or their daughters; the charms of a beauteous maid, or a
comely boy, secured the connivance of the inspectors; who sometimes cast
an eye of covetousness on the fringed carpets and linen garments of
their new allies, ^68 or who sacrificed their duty to the mean
consideration of filling their farms with cattle, and their houses with
slaves. The Goths, with arms in their hands, were permitted to enter the
boats; and when their strength was collected on the other side of the
river, the immense camp which was spread over the plains and the hills
of the Lower Maesia, assumed a threatening and even hostile aspect. The
leaders of the Ostrogoths, Alatheus and Saphrax, the guardians of their
infant king, appeared soon afterwards on the Northern banks of the
Danube; and immediately despatched their ambassadors to the court of
Antioch, to solicit, with the same professions of allegiance and
gratitude, the same favor which had been granted to the suppliant
Visigoths. The absolute refusal of Valens suspended their progress, and
discovered the repentance, the suspicions, and the fears, of the
Imperial council.</p></li>
<li><p>: A very curious, but obscure, passage of Eunapius, appears to me
to have been misunderstood by M. Mai, to whom we owe its discovery. The
substance is as follows: “The Goths transported over the river their
native deities, with their priests of both sexes; but concerning their
rites they maintained a deep and ‘adamantine silence.’ To the Romans
they pretended to be generally Christians, and placed certain persons to
represent bishops in a conspicuous manner on their wagons. There was
even among them a sort of what are called monks, persons whom it was not
difficult to mimic; it was enough to wear black raiment, to be wicked,
and held in respect.“ (Eunapius hated the “black-robed monks,“ as
appears in another passage, with the cordial detestation of a heathen
philosopher.) “Thus, while they faithfully but secretly adhered to their
own religion, the Romans were weak enough to suppose them perfect
Christians.“ Mai, 277. Eunapius in Niebuhr, 82. - M]</p></li>
<li><p>whose military renown was disgraced and polluted by the public
infamy of their domestic manners. Every youth, on his entrance into the
world, was united by the ties of honorable friendship, and brutal love,
to some warrior of the tribe; nor could he hope to be released from this
unnatural connection, till he had approved his manhood by slaying, in
single combat, a huge bear, or a wild boar of the forest. ^84 But the
most powerful auxiliaries of the Goths were drawn from the camp of those
enemies who had expelled them from their native seats. The loose
subordination, and extensive possessions, of the Huns and the Alani,
delayed the conquests, and distracted the councils, of that victorious
people. Several of the hords were allured by the liberal promises of
Fritigern; and the rapid cavalry of Scythia added weight and energy to
the steady and strenuous efforts of the Gothic infantry. The Sarmatians,
who could never forgive the successor of Valentinian, enjoyed and
increased the general confusion; and a seasonable irruption of the
Alemanni, into the provinces of Gaul, engaged the attention, and
diverted the forces, of the emperor of the West. ^85</p></li>
<li><p>: The Taifalae, who at this period inhabited the country which
now forms the principality of Wallachia, were, in my opinion, the last
remains of the great and powerful nation of the Dacians, (Daci or
Dahae.) which has given its name to these regions, over which they had
ruled so long. The Taifalae passed with the Goths into the territory of
the empire. A great number of them entered the Roman service, and were
quartered in different provinces. They are mentioned in the Notitia
Imperii. There was a considerable body in the country of the Pictavi,
now Poithou. They long retained their manners and language, and caused
the name of the Theofalgicus pagus to be given to the district they
inhabited. Two places in the department of La Vendee, Tiffanges and La
Tiffardiere, still preserve evident traces of this denomination.

respect, and betrayed, in the presence of Theodosius, the fatal secret
of their domestic disputes. The emperor, who had been the reluctant
witness of this extraordinary controversy, dissembled his fears and
resentment, and soon dismissed the tumultuous assembly. Fravitta,
alarmed and exasperated by the insolence of his rival, whose departure
from the palace might have been the signal of a civil war, boldly
followed him; and, drawing his sword, laid Priulf dead at his feet.
Their companions flew to arms; and the faithful champion of Rome would
have been oppressed by superior numbers, if he had not been protected by
the seasonable interposition of the Imperial guards. ^135 Such were the
scenes of Barbaric rage, which disgraced the palace and table of the
Roman emperor; and, as the impatient Goths could only be restrained by
the firm and temperate character of Theodosius, the public safety seemed
to depend on the life and abilities of a single man. ^136</p></li>

seditious prelate was condemned, by the magistrate of the province,
either to rebuild the synagogue, or to repay the damage; and this
moderate sentence was confirmed by the emperor. But it was not confirmed
by the archbishop of Milan. ^92 He dictated an epistle of censure and
reproach, more suitable, perhaps, if the emperor had received the mark
of circumcision, and renounced the faith of his baptism. Ambrose
considers the toleration of the Jewish, as the persecution of the
Christian, religion; boldly declares that he himself, and every true
believer, would eagerly dispute with the bishop of Callinicum the merit
of the deed, and the crown of martyrdom; and laments, in the most
pathetic terms, that the execution of the sentence would be fatal to the
fame and salvation of Theodosius. As this private admonition did not
produce an immediate effect, the archbishop, from his pulpit, ^93
publicly addressed the emperor on his throne; ^94 nor would he consent
to offer the oblation of the altar, till he had obtained from Theodosius
a solemn and positive declaration, which secured the impunity of the
bishop and monks of Callinicum. The recantation of Theodosius was

<li><p>The liberty of suffrages, which he affected to allow, was
destroyed by the hopes and fears that his presence inspired; and the
arbitrary exile of Symmachus was a recent admonition, that it might be
dangerous to oppose the wishes of the monarch. On a regular division of
the senate, Jupiter was condemned and degraded by the sense of a very
large majority; and it is rather surprising, that any members should be
found bold enough to declare, by their speeches and votes, that they
were still attached to the interest of an abdicated deity. ^19 The hasty
conversion of the senate must be attributed either to supernatural or to
sordid motives; and many of these reluctant proselytes betrayed, on
every favorable occasion, their secret disposition to throw aside the
mask of odious dissimulation. But they were gradually fixed in the new
religion, as the cause of the ancient became more hopeless; they yielded
to the authority of the emperor, to the fashion of the times, and to the
entreaties of their wives and children, ^20 who were instigated and
governed by the clergy of Rome and the monks of the East. The edifying
example of the Anician family was soon imitated by the rest of the
nobility: the Bassi, the Paullini, the Gracchi, embraced the Christian
religion; and “the luminaries of the world, the venerable assembly of
Catos (such are the high-flown expressions of Prudentius) were impatient
to strip themselves of their pontifical garment; to cast the skin of the
old serpent; to assume the snowy robes of baptismal innocence, and to
humble the pride of the consular fasces before tombs of the martyrs.“
^21 The citizens, who subsisted by their own industry, and the populace,
who were supported by the public liberality, filled the churches of the
Lateran, and Vatican, with an incessant throng of devout proselytes. The
decrees of the senate, which proscribed the worship of idols, were
ratified by the general consent of the Romans; ^22 the splendor of the
Capitol was defaced, and the solitary temples were abandoned to ruin and
contempt. ^23 Rome submitted to the yoke of the Gospel; and the
vanquished provinces had not yet lost their reverence for the name and
authority of Rome. ^</p></li>
<li><p>: M. Beugnot (in his Histoire de la Destruction du Paganisme en
Occident, i. p. 483 - 488) questions, altogether, the truth of this
statement. It is very remarkable that Zosimus and Prudentius concur in
asserting the fact of the question being solemnly deliberated by the
senate, though with directly opposite results. Zosimus declares that the
majority of the assembly adhered to the ancient religion of Rome; Gibbon
has adopted the authority of Prudentius, who, as a Latin writer, though
a poet, deserves more credit than the Greek historian. Both concur in
placing this scene after the second triumph of Theodosius; but it has
been almost demonstrated (and Gibbon - see the preceding note - seems to
have acknowledged this) by Pagi and Tillemont, that Theodosius did not
visit Rome after the defeat of Eugenius. M. Beugnot urges, with much
force, the improbability that the Christian emperor would submit such a
question to the senate, whose authority was nearly obsolete, except on
one occasion, which was almost hailed as an epoch in the restoration of
her ancient privileges. The silence of Ambrose and of Jerom on an event
so striking, and redounding so much to the honor of Christianity, is of
considerable weight. M. Beugnot would ascribe the whole scene to the
poetic imagination of Prudentius; but I must observe, that, however
Prudentius is sometimes elevated by the grandeur of his subject to vivid
and eloquent language, this flight of invention would be so much bolder
and more vigorous than usual with this poet, that I cannot but suppose
there must have been some foundation for the story, though it may have
been exaggerated by the poet, or misrepresented by the historian. -
M]</p></li>
<li><p>: M. Beugnot is more correct in his general estimate of the
measures enforced by Theodosius for the abolition of Paganism. He seized
(according to Zosimus) the funds bestowed by the public for the expense
of sacrifices. The public sacrifices ceased, not because they were
positively prohibited, but because the public treasury would no longer
bear the expense. The public and the private sacrifices in the
provinces, which were not under the same regulations with those of the
capital, continued to take place. In Rome itself, many pagan ceremonies,
which were without sacrifice, remained in full force. The gods,
therefore, were invoked, the temples were frequented, the pontificates
inscribed, according to ancient usage, among the family titles of honor;
and it cannot be asserted that idolatry was completely destroyed by
Theodosius. See Beugnot, p. 491. - M.]</p></li>

<li><p>convinced the Pagans that he meditated a more important and
dangerous enterprise. In the tumultuous capital of Egypt, the slightest
provocation was sufficient to inflame a civil war. The votaries of
Serapis, whose strength and numbers were much inferior to those of their
antagonists, rose in arms at the instigation of the philosopher
Olympius, ^45 who exhorted them to die in the defence of the altars of
the gods. These Pagan fanatics fortified themselves in the temple, or
rather fortress, of Serapis; repelled the besiegers by daring sallies,
and a resolute defence; and, by the inhuman cruelties which they
exercised on their Christian prisoners, obtained the last consolation of
despair. The efforts of the prudent magistrate were usefully exerted for
the establishment of a truce, till the answer of Theodosius should
determine the fate of Serapis. The two parties assembled, without arms,
in the principal square; and the Imperial rescript was publicly read.
But when a sentence of destruction against the idols of Alexandria was
pronounced, the Christians set up a shout of joy and exultation, whilst
the unfortunate Pagans, whose fury had given way to consternation,
retired with hasty and silent steps, and eluded, by their flight or
obscurity, the resentment of their enemies. Theophilus proceeded to
demolish the temple of Serapis, without any other difficulties, than
those which he found in the weight and solidity of the materials: but
these obstacles proved so insuperable, that he was obliged to leave the
foundations; and to content himself with reducing the edifice itself to
a heap of rubbish, a part of which was soon afterwards cleared away, to
make room for a church, erected in honor of the Christian martyrs. The
valuable library of Alexandria was pillaged or destroyed; and near
twenty years afterwards, the appearance of the empty shelves excited the
regret and indignation of every spectator, whose mind was not totally
darkened by religious prejudice. ^46 The compositions of ancient genius,
so many of which have irretrievably perished, might surely have been
excepted from the wreck of idolatry, for the amusement and instruction
of succeeding ages; and either the zeal or the avarice of the
archbishop, ^47 might have been satiated with the rich spoils, which
were the reward of his victory. While the images and vases of gold and
silver were carefully melted, and those of a less valuable metal were
contemptuously broken, and cast into the streets, Theophilus labored to
expose the frauds and vices of the ministers of the idols; their
dexterity in the management of the loadstone; their secret methods of
introducing a human actor into a hollow statue; ^</p></li>

<li><p>This prohibitory law is expressed in the most absolute and
comprehensive terms. “It is our will and pleasure,“ says the emperor,
“that none of our subjects, whether magistrates or private citizens,
however exalted or however humble may be their rank and condition, shall
presume, in any city or in any place, to worship an inanimate idol, by
the sacrifice of a guiltless victim.“ The act of sacrificing, and the
practice of divination by the entrails of the victim, are declared
(without any regard to the object of the inquiry) a crime of high
treason against the state, which can be expiated only by the death of
the guilty. The rites of Pagan superstition, which might seem less
bloody and atrocious, are abolished, as highly injurious to the truth
and honor of religion; luminaries, garlands, frankincense, and libations
of wine, are specially enumerated and condemned; and the harmless claims
of the domestic genius, of the household gods, are included in this
rigorous proscription. The use of any of these profane and illegal
ceremonies, subjects the offender to the forfeiture of the house or
estate, where they have been performed; and if he has artfully chosen
the property of another for the scene of his impiety, he is compelled to
discharge, without delay, a heavy fine of twenty-five pounds of gold, or
more than one thousand pounds sterling. A fine, not less considerable,
is imposed on the connivance of the secret enemies of religion, who
shall neglect the duty of their respective stations, either to reveal,
or to punish, the guilt of idolatry. Such was the persecuting spirit of
the laws of Theodosius, which were repeatedly enforced by his sons and
grandsons, with the loud and unanimous applause of the Christian world.

<li><p>: Paganism maintained its ground for a considerable time in the

<li><p>Theodosius distinguished his liberal regard for virtue and genius
by the consular dignity, which he bestowed on Symmachus; ^62 and by the
personal friendship which he expressed to Libanius; ^63 and the two
eloquent apologists of Paganism were never required either to change or
to dissemble their religious opinions. The Pagans were indulged in the
most licentious freedom of speech and writing; the historical and
philosophic remains of Eunapius, Zosimus, ^64 and the fanatic teachers
of the school of Plato, betray the most furious animosity, and contain
the sharpest invectives, against the sentiments and conduct of their
victorious adversaries. If these audacious libels were publicly known,
we must applaud the good sense of the Christian princes, who viewed,
with a smile of contempt, the last struggles of superstition and
despair. ^65 But the Imperial laws, which prohibited the sacrifices and
ceremonies of Paganism, were rigidly executed; and every hour
contributed to destroy the influence of a religion, which was supported
by custom, rather than by argument. The devotion or the poet, or the
philosopher, may be secretly nourished by prayer, meditation, and study;
but the exercise of public worship appears to be the only solid
foundation of the religious sentiments of the people, which derive their
force from imitation and habit. The interruption of that public exercise
may consummate, in the period of a few years, the important work of a
national revolution. The memory of theological opinions cannot long be
preserved, without the artificial helps of priests, of temples, and of
books. ^66 The ignorant vulgar, whose minds are still agitated by the
blind hopes and terrors of superstition, will be soon persuaded by their
superiors to direct their vows to the reigning deities of the age; and
will insensibly imbibe an ardent zeal for the support and propagation of
the new doctrine, which spiritual hunger at first compelled them to
accept. The generation that arose in the world after the promulgation of
the Imperial laws, was attracted within the pale of the Catholic church:
and so rapid, yet so gentle, was the fall of Paganism, that only
twenty-eight years after the death of Theodosius, the faint and minute
vestiges were no longer visible to the eye of the legislator.
^67</p></li>
<li><p>: The most remarkable instance of this, at a much later period,
occurs in the person of Merobaudes, a general and a poet, who flourished
in the first half of the fifth century. A statue in honor of Merobaudes
was placed in the Forum of Trajan, of which the inscription is still
extant. Fragments of his poems have been recovered by the industry and
sagacity of Niebuhr. In one passage, Merobaudes, in the genuine heathen
spirit, attributes the ruin of the empire to the abolition of Paganism,
and almost renews the old accusation of Atheism against Christianity. He
impersonates some deity, probably Discord, who summons Bellona to take
arms for the destruction of Rome; and in a strain of fierce irony
recommends to her other fatal measures, to extirpate the gods of Rome:
-</p></li>
<li><p>: But there was always this important difference between
Christian and heathen Polytheism. In Paganism this was the whole
religion; in the darkest ages of Christianity, some, however obscure and
vague, Christian notions of future retribution, of the life after death,
lurked at the bottom, and operated, to a certain extent, on the thoughts
and feelings, sometimes on the actions. - M.]</p></li>

<li><p>But Honorius ^38 had scarcely passed the Po, before he was
overtaken by the speed of the Gothic cavalry; ^39 since the urgency of
the danger compelled him to seek a temporary shelter within the
fortifications of Asta, a town of Liguria or Piemont, situate on the
banks of the Tanarus. ^40 The siege of an obscure place, which contained
so rich a prize, and seemed incapable of a long resistance, was
instantly formed, and indefatigably pressed, by the king of the Goths;
and the bold declaration, which the emperor might afterwards make, that
his breast had never been susceptible of fear, did not probably obtain
much credit, even in his own court. ^41 In the last, and almost hopeless
extremity, after the Barbarians had already proposed the indignity of a
capitulation, the Imperial captive was suddenly relieved by the fame,
the approach, and at length the presence, of the hero, whom he had so
long expected. At the head of a chosen and intrepid vanguard, Stilicho
swam the stream of the Addua, to gain the time which he must have lost
in the attack of the bridge; the passage of the Po was an enterprise of
much less hazard and difficulty; and the successful action, in which he
cut his way through the Gothic camp under the walls of Asta, revived the
hopes, and vindicated the honor, of Rome. Instead of grasping the fruit
of his victory, the Barbarian was gradually invested, on every side, by
the troops of the West, who successively issued through all the passes
of the Alps; his quarters were straitened; his convoys were intercepted;
and the vigilance of the Romans prepared to form a chain of
fortifications, and to besiege the lines of the besiegers. A military
council was assembled of the long-haired chiefs of the Gothic nation; of
aged warriors, whose bodies were wrapped in furs, and whose stern
countenances were marked with honorable wounds. They weighed the glory
of persisting in their attempt against the advantage of securing their
plunder; and they recommended the prudent measure of a seasonable
retreat. In this important debate, Alaric displayed the spirit of the
conqueror of Rome; and after he had reminded his countrymen of their
achievements and of their designs, he concluded his animating speech by
the solemn and positive assurance that he was resolved to find in Italy
either a kingdom or a grave. ^42</p></li>
<li><p>: According to Le Beau and his commentator M. St. Martin,
Honorius did not attempt to fly. Settlements were offered to the Goths
in Lombardy, and they advanced from the Po towards the Alps to take
possession of them. But it was a treacherous stratagem of Stilicho, who
surprised them while they were reposing on the faith of this treaty. Le
Beau, v. x.]</p></li>
<li><p>The citizens, who adhered to the manners of their ancestors,
might perhaps insinuate that the last remains of a martial spirit were
preserved in this school of fortitude, which accustomed the Romans to
the sight of blood, and to the contempt of death; a vain and cruel
prejudice, so nobly confuted by the valor of ancient Greece, and of
modern Europe! ^59</p></li>
<li><p>: Muller, in his valuable Treatise, de Genio, moribus et luxu
aevi Theodosiani, is disposed to question the effect produced by the
heroic, or rather saintly, death of Telemachus. No prohibitory law of
Honorius is to be found in the Theodosian Code, only the old and
imperfect edict of Constantine. But Muller has produced no evidence or
allusion to gladiatorial shows after this period. The combats with wild
beasts certainly lasted till the fall of the Western empire; but the
gladiatorial combats ceased either by common consent, or by Imperial
edict. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>and the nations who retreated before them must have pressed with
incumbent weight on the confines of Germany. ^65 The inhabitants of
those regions, which the ancients have assigned to the Suevi, the
Vandals, and the Burgundians, might embrace the resolution of abandoning
to the fugitives of Sarmatia their woods and morasses; or at least of
discharging their superfluous numbers on the provinces of the Roman
empire. ^66 About four years after the victorious Toulun had assumed the
title of Khan of the Geougen, another Barbarian, the haughty Rhodogast,
or Radagaisus, ^67 marched from the northern extremities of Germany
almost to the gates of Rome, and left the remains of his army to achieve
the destruction of the West. The Vandals, the Suevi, and the
Burgundians, formed the strength of this mighty host; but the Alani, who
had found a hospitable reception in their new seats, added their active
cavalry to the heavy infantry of the Germans; and the Gothic adventurers
crowded so eagerly to the standard of Radagaisus, that by some
historians, he has been styled the King of the Goths. Twelve thousand
warriors, distinguished above the vulgar by their noble birth, or their
valiant deeds, glittered in the van; ^68 and the whole multitude, which
was not less than two hundred thousand fighting men, might be increased,
by the accession of women, of children, and of slaves, to the amount of
four hundred thousand persons. This formidable emigration issued from
the same coast of the Baltic, which had poured forth the myriads of the
Cimbri and Teutones, to assault Rome and Italy in the vigor of the
republic. After the departure of those Barbarians, their native country,
which was marked by the vestiges of their greatness, long ramparts, and
gigantic moles, ^69 remained, during some ages, a vast and dreary
solitude; till the human species was renewed by the powers of
generation, and the vacancy was filled by the influx of new inhabitants.
The nations who now usurp an extent of land which they are unable to
cultivate, would soon be assisted by the industrious poverty of their
neighbors, if the government of Europe did not protect the claims of
dominion and property.</p></li>
<li><p>: There is no authority which connects this inroad of the
Teutonic tribes with the movements of the Huns. The Huns can hardly have
reached the shores of the Baltic, and probably the greater part of the
forces of Radagaisus, particularly the Vandals, had long occupied a more
southern position. - M.]</p></li>

constituted his real guilt. An honorable reluctance to shed the blood of
his countrymen appears to have contributed to the success of his

<li>: M. Dureau de la Malle (Economic Politique des Romaines, t. i.
p. 369) quotes a passage from the xvth chapter of Gibbon, in which he
estimates the population of Rome at not less than a million, and adds
(omitting any reference to this passage,) that he (Gibbon) could not
have seriously studied the question. M. Dureau de la Malle proceeds to
argue that Rome, as contained within the walls of Servius Tullius,
occupying an area only one fifth of that of Paris, could not have
contained 300,000 inhabitants; within those of Aurelian not more than
560,000, inclusive of soldiers and strangers. The suburbs, he endeavors
to show, both up to the time of Aurelian, and after his reign, were
neither so extensive, nor so populous, as generally supposed. M. Dureau
de la Malle has but imperfectly quoted the important passage of
Dionysius, that which proves that when he wrote (in the time of
Augustus) the walls of Servius no longer marked the boundary of the
city. In many places they were so built upon, that it was impossible to
trace them. There was no certain limit, where the city ended and ceased
to be the city; it stretched out to so boundless an extent into the
country. Ant. Rom. iv. 13. None of M. de la Malle’s arguments appear to
me to prove, against this statement, that these irregular suburbs did
not extend so far in many parts, as to make it impossible to calculate
accurately the inhabited area of the city. Though no doubt the city, as
reconstructed by Nero, was much less closely built and with many more
open spaces for palaces, temples, and other public edifices, yet many
passages seem to prove that the laws respecting the height of houses
were not rigidly enforced. A great part of the lower especially of the
slave population, were very densely crowded, and lived, even more than
in our modern towns, in cellars and subterranean dwellings under the
public edifices. Nor do M. de la Malle’s arguments, by which he would
explain the insulae insulae (of which the Notitiae Urbis give us the
number) as rows of shops, with a chamber or two within the domus, or
houses of the wealthy, satisfy me as to their soundness of their
scholarship. Some passages which he adduces directly contradict his
theory; none, as appears to me, distinctly prove it. I must adhere to
the old interpretation of the word, as chiefly dwellings for the
middling or lower classes, or clusters of tenements, often perhaps,
under the same roof.</li>

popular applause, and to assume the peaceful honors of the consulship.
But a formidable ally appeared in arms to vindicate the majesty of the
empire, and to guard the peace and liberty of Scythia. ^39 The superior
forces of Uldin, king of the Huns, opposed the progress of Gainas; a
hostile and ruined country prohibited his retreat; he disdained to
capitulate; and after repeatedly attempting to cut his way through the
ranks of the enemy, he was slain, with his desperate followers, in the
field of battle. Eleven days after the naval victory of the Hellespont,
the head of Gainas, the inestimable gift of the conqueror, was received
at Constantinople with the most liberal expressions of gratitude; and
the public deliverance was celebrated by festivals and illuminations.
The triumphs of Arcadius became the subject of epic poems; ^40 and the
monarch, no longer oppressed by any hostile terrors, resigned himself to
the mild and absolute dominion of his wife, the fair and artful Eudoxia,

<li><p>After the death of Arsaces, the Romans suppressed the regal
government, and imposed on their allies the condition of subjects. The
military command was delegated to the count of the Armenian frontier;
the city of Theodosiopolis ^84 was built and fortified in a strong
situation, on a fertile and lofty ground, near the sources of the
Euphrates; and the dependent territories were ruled by five satraps,
whose dignity was marked by a peculiar habit of gold and purple. The
less fortunate nobles, who lamented the loss of their king, and envied
the honors of their equals, were provoked to negotiate their peace and
pardon at the Persian court; and returning, with their followers, to the
palace of Artaxata, acknowledged Chosroes ^! for their lawful sovereign.
About thirty years afterwards, Artasires, the nephew and successor of
Chosroes, fell under the displeasure of the haughty and capricious
nobles of Armenia; and they unanimously desired a Persian governor in
the room of an unworthy king. The answer of the archbishop Isaac, whose
sanction they earnestly solicited, is expressive of the character of a
superstitious people. He deplored the manifest and inexcusable vices of
Artasires; and declared, that he should not hesitate to accuse him
before the tribunal of a Christian emperor, who would punish, without
destroying, the sinner. “Our king,“ continued Isaac, “is too much
addicted to licentious pleasures, but he has been purified in the holy
waters of baptism. He is a lover of women, but he does not adore the
fire or the elements. He may deserve the reproach of lewdness, but he is
an undoubted Catholic; and his faith is pure, though his manners are
flagitious. I will never consent to abandon my sheep to the rage of
devouring wolves; and you would soon repent your rash exchange of the
infirmities of a believer, for the specious virtues of a heathen.“ ^85
Exasperated by the firmness of Isaac, the factious nobles accused both
the king and the archbishop as the secret adherents of the emperor; and
absurdly rejoiced in the sentence of condemnation, which, after a
partial hearing, was solemnly pronounced by Bahram himself. The
descendants of Arsaces were degraded from the royal dignity, ^86 which
they had possessed above five hundred and sixty years; ^87 and the
dominions of the unfortunate Artasires, ^</p></li>

despised, reflected some lustre on the declining empire of the younger
Theodosius.</p></li>
<li><p>: The division of Armenia, according to M. St. Martin, took place
much earlier, A. C. 390. The Eastern or Persian division was four times
as large as the Western or Roman. This partition took place during the
reigns of Theodosius the First, and Varanes (Bahram) the Fourth.

<li><p>They encountered the Persian army in the plains of Media and the
air, according to their own expression, was darkened by a cloud of
arrows. But the Huns were obliged to retire before the numbers of the
enemy. Their laborious retreat was effected by a different road; they
lost the greatest part of their booty; and at length returned to the
royal camp, with some knowledge of the country, and an impatient desire
of revenge. In the free conversation of the Imperial ambassadors, who
discussed, at the court of Attila, the character and designs of their
formidable enemy, the ministers of Constantinople expressed their hope,
that his strength might be diverted and employed in a long and doubtful
contest with the princes of the house of Sassan. The more sagacious
Italians admonished their Eastern brethren of the folly and danger of
such a hope; and convinced them, that the Medes and Persians were
incapable of resisting the arms of the Huns; and that the easy and
important acquisition would exalt the pride, as well as power, of the
conqueror. Instead of contenting himself with a moderate contribution,
and a military title, which equalled him only to the generals of
Theodosius, Attila would proceed to impose a disgraceful and intolerable
yoke on the necks of the prostrate and captive Romans, who would then be
encompassed, on all sides, by the empire of the Huns. ^17</p></li>

<li><p>days’ journey; but, from the proposal of Attila to remove the
situation of the national market, it soon appeared, that he comprehended
the ruined city of Naissus within the limits of his dominions. II. The
king of the Huns required and obtained, that his tribute or subsidy
should be augmented from seven hundred pounds of gold to the annual sum
of two thousand one hundred; and he stipulated the immediate payment of
six thousand pounds of gold, to defray the expenses, or to expiate the
guilt, of the war. One might imagine, that such a demand, which scarcely
equalled the measure of private wealth, would have been readily
discharged by the opulent empire of the East; and the public distress
affords a remarkable proof of the impoverished, or at least of the
disorderly, state of the finances. A large proportion of the taxes
extorted from the people was detained and intercepted in their passage,
though the foulest channels, to the treasury of Constantinople. The
revenue was dissipated by Theodosius and his favorites in wasteful and
profuse luxury; which was disguised by the names of Imperial
magnificence, or Christian charity. The immediate supplies had been
exhausted by the unforeseen necessity of military preparations. A
personal contribution, rigorously, but capriciously, imposed on the
members of the senatorian order, was the only expedient that could
disarm, without loss of time, the impatient avarice of Attila; and the
poverty of the nobles compelled them to adopt the scandalous resource of
exposing to public auction the jewels of their wives, and the hereditary
ornaments of their palaces. ^34 III. The king of the Huns appears to
have established, as a principle of national jurisprudence, that he
could never lose the property, which he had once acquired, in the
persons who had yielded either a voluntary, or reluctant, submission to
his authority. From this principle he concluded, and the conclusions of
Attila were irrevocable laws, that the Huns, who had been taken prisoner
in war, should be released without delay, and without ransom; that every
Roman captive, who had presumed to escape, should purchase his right to
freedom at the price of twelve pieces of gold; and that all the
Barbarians, who had deserted the standard of Attila, should be restored,
without any promise or stipulation of pardon.</p></li>

<li><p>from the Danube, than he began to experience the fastidious
insolence of the conqueror. He was sternly forbid to pitch his tents in
a pleasant valley, lest he should infringe the distant awe that was due
to the royal mansion. ^! The ministers of Attila pressed them to
communicate the business, and the instructions, which he reserved for
the ear of their sovereign When Maximin temperately urged the contrary
practice of nations, he was still more confounded to find that the
resolutions of the Sacred Consistory, those secrets (says Priscus) which
should not be revealed to the gods themselves, had been treacherously
disclosed to the public enemy. On his refusal to comply with such
ignominious terms, the Imperial envoy was commanded instantly to depart;
the order was recalled; it was again repeated; and the Huns renewed
their ineffectual attempts to subdue the patient firmness of Maximin. At
length, by the intercession of Scotta, the brother of Onegesius, whose
friendship had been purchased by a liberal gift, he was admitted to the
royal presence; but, in stead of obtaining a decisive answer, he was
compelled to undertake a remote journey towards the north, that Attila
might enjoy the proud satisfaction of receiving, in the same camp, the
ambassadors of the Eastern and Western empires. His journey was
regulated by the guides, who obliged him to halt, to hasten his march,
or to deviate from the common road, as it best suited the convenience of
the king. The Romans, who traversed the plains of Hungary, suppose that
they passed several navigable rivers, either in canoes or portable
boats; but there is reason to suspect that the winding stream of the
Teyss, or Tibiscus, might present itself in different places under
different names. From the contiguous villages they received a plentiful
and regular supply of provisions; mead instead of wine, millet in the
place of bread, and a certain liquor named camus, which according to the
report of Priscus, was distilled from barley. ^42 Such fare might appear
coarse and indelicate to men who had tasted the luxury of
Constantinople; but, in their accidental distress, they were relieved by
the gentleness and hospitality of the same Barbarians, so terrible and
so merciless in war. The ambassadors had encamped on the edge of a large
morass. A violent tempest of wind and rain, of thunder and lightning,
overturned their tents, immersed their baggage and furniture in the
water, and scattered their retinue, who wandered in the darkness of the
night, uncertain of their road, and apprehensive of some unknown danger,
till they awakened by their cries the inhabitants of a neighboring
village, the property of the widow of Bleda. A bright illumination, and,
in a few moments, a comfortable fire of reeds, was kindled by their
officious benevolence; the wants, and even the desires, of the Romans
were liberally satisfied; and they seem to have been embarrassed by the
singular politeness of Bleda’s widow, who added to her other favors the
gift, or at least the loan, of a sufficient number of beautiful and
obsequious damsels. The sunshine of the succeeding day was dedicated to
repose, to collect and dry the baggage, and to the refreshment of the
men and horses: but, in the evening, before they pursued their journey,
the ambassadors expressed their gratitude to the bounteous lady of the
village, by a very acceptable present of silver cups, red fleeces, dried
fruits, and Indian pepper. Soon after this adventure, they rejoined the
march of Attila, from whom they had been separated about six days, and
slowly proceeded to the capital of an empire, which did not contain, in
the space of several thousand miles, a single city.</p></li>

<li><p>the principal queen, he admired the singular architecture on her
mansion, the height of the round columns, the size and beauty of the
wood, which was curiously shaped or turned or polished or carved; and
his attentive eye was able to discover some taste in the ornaments and
some regularity in the proportions. After passing through the guards,
who watched before the gate, the ambassadors were introduced into the
private apartment of Cerca. The wife of Attila received their visit
sitting, or rather lying, on a soft couch; the floor was covered with a
carpet; the domestics formed a circle round the queen; and her damsels,
seated on the ground, were employed in working the variegated embroidery
which adorned the dress of the Barbaric warriors. The Huns were
ambitious of displaying those riches which were the fruit and evidence
of their victories: the trappings of their horses, their swords, and
even their shoes, were studded with gold and precious stones; and their
tables were profusely spread with plates, and goblets, and vases of gold
and silver, which had been fashioned by the labor of Grecian
artists.</p></li>
<li><p>: The name of this queen occurs three times in Priscus, and
always in a different form - Cerca, Creca, and Rheca. The Scandinavian
poets have preserved her memory under the name of Herkia. St. Martin,

<li><p>might perhaps contribute to mollify the native fierceness of his
temper. The entrance of Attila into the royal village was marked by a
very singular ceremony. A numerous troop of women came out to meet their
hero and their king. They marched before him, distributed into long and
regular files; the intervals between the files were filled by white
veils of thin linen, which the women on either side bore aloft in their
hands, and which formed a canopy for a chorus of young virgins, who
chanted hymns and songs in the Scythian language. The wife of his
favorite Onegesius, with a train of female attendants, saluted Attila at
the door of her own house, on his way to the palace; and offered,
according to the custom of the country, her respectful homage, by
entreating him to taste the wine and meat which she had prepared for his
reception. As soon as the monarch had graciously accepted her hospitable
gift, his domestics lifted a small silver table to a convenient height,
as he sat on horseback; and Attila, when he had touched the goblet with
his lips, again saluted the wife of Onegesius, and continued his march.
During his residence at the seat of empire, his hours were not wasted in
the recluse idleness of a seraglio; and the king of the Huns could
maintain his superior dignity, without concealing his person from the
public view. He frequently assembled his council, and gave audience to
the ambassadors of the nations; and his people might appeal to the
supreme tribunal, which he held at stated times, and, according to the
Eastern custom, before the principal gate of his wooden palace. The
Romans, both of the East and of the West, were twice invited to the
banquets, where Attila feasted with the princes and nobles of Scythia.
Maximin and his colleagues were stopped on the threshold, till they had
made a devout libation to the health and prosperity of the king of the
Huns; and were conducted, after this ceremony, to their respective seats
in a spacious hall. The royal table and couch, covered with carpets and
fine linen, was raised by several steps in the midst of the hall; and a
son, an uncle, or perhaps a favorite king, were admitted to share the
simple and homely repast of Attila. Two lines of small tables, each of
which contained three or four guests, were ranged in order on either
hand; the right was esteemed the most honorable, but the Romans
ingenuously confess, that they were placed on the left; and that Beric,
an unknown chieftain, most probably of the Gothic race, preceded the
representatives of Theodosius and Valentinian. The Barbarian monarch
received from his cup-bearer a goblet filled with wine, and courteously
drank to the health of the most distinguished guest; who rose from his
seat, and expressed, in the same manner, his loyal and respectful vows.
This ceremony was successively performed for all, or at least for the
illustrious persons of the assembly; and a considerable time must have
been consumed, since it was thrice repeated as each course or service
was placed on the table. But the wine still remained after the meat had
been removed; and the Huns continued to indulge their intemperance long
after the sober and decent ambassadors of the two empires had withdrawn
themselves from the nocturnal banquet. Yet before they retired, they
enjoyed a singular opportunity of observing the manners of the nation in
their convivial amusements. Two Scythians stood before the couch of
Attila, and recited the verses which they had composed, to celebrate his
valor and his victories. ^</p></li>
<li><p>successively excited the mirth of the rude spectators, by their
deformed figure, ridiculous dress, antic gestures, absurd speeches, and
the strange, unintelligible confusion of the Latin, the Gothic, and the
Hunnic languages; and the hall resounded with loud and licentious peals
of laughter. In the midst of this intemperate riot, Attila alone,
without a change of countenance, maintained his steadfast and inflexible
gravity; which was never relaxed, except on the entrance of Irnac, the
youngest of his sons: he embraced the boy with a smile of paternal
tenderness, gently pinched him by the cheek, and betrayed a partial
affection, which was justified by the assurance of his prophets, that
Irnac would be the future support of his family and empire. Two days
afterwards, the ambassadors received a second invitation; and they had
reason to praise the politeness, as well as the hospitality, of Attila.
The king of the Huns held a long and familiar conversation with Maximin;
but his civility was interrupted by rude expressions and haughty
reproaches; and he was provoked, by a motive of interest, to support,
with unbecoming zeal, the private claims of his secretary
Constantius.</p></li>
<li><p>: Was this his own daughter, or the daughter of a person named
Escam? (Gibbon has written incorrectly Eslam, an unknown name. The
officer of Attila, called Eslas.) In either case the construction is
imperfect: a good Greek writer would have introduced an article to
determine the sense. Nor is it quite clear, whether Scythian usage is
adduced to excuse the polygamy, or a marriage, which would be considered
incestuous in other countries. The Latin version has carefully preserved
the ambiguity, filiam Escam uxorem. I am not inclined to construe it
‘his own daughter’ though I have too little confidence in the uniformity
of the grammatical idioms of the Byzantines (though Priscus is one of
the best) to express myself without hesitation. - M.]</p></li>

Gaudentius, who held a distinguished rank in the province of Scythia,
gradually rose from the station of a military domestic, to the dignity
of master of the cavalry. Their son, who was enrolled almost in his
infancy in the guards, was given as a hostage, first to Alaric, and
afterwards to the Huns; ^! and he successively obtained the civil and
military honors of the palace, for which he was equally qualified by
superior merit. The graceful figure of Aetius was not above the middle
stature; but his manly limbs were admirably formed for strength, beauty,
and agility; and he excelled in the martial exercises of managing a
horse, drawing the bow, and darting the javelin. He could patiently
endure the want of food, or of sleep; and his mind and body were alike
capable of the most laborious efforts. He possessed the genuine courage
that can despise not only dangers, but injuries: and it was impossible
either to corrupt, or deceive, or intimidate the firm integrity of his
soul.“ ^6 The Barbarians, who had seated themselves in the Western
provinces, were insensibly taught to respect the faith and valor of the
patrician Aetius. He soothed their passions, consulted their prejudices,
balanced their interests, and checked their ambition. ^</p></li>

<li><p>The minister of Theodoric compares them, in his quaint
declamatory style, to water-fowl, who had fixed their nests on the bosom
of the waves; and though he allows, that the Venetian provinces had
formerly contained many noble families, he insinuates, that they were
now reduced by misfortune to the same level of humble poverty. Fish was
the common, and almost the universal, food of every rank: their only
treasure consisted in the plenty of salt, which they extracted from the
sea: and the exchange of that commodity, so essential to human life, was
substituted in the neighboring markets to the currency of gold and
silver. A people, whose habitations might be doubtfully assigned to the
earth or water, soon became alike familiar with the two elements; and
the demands of avarice succeeded to those of necessity. The islanders,
who, from Grado to Chiozza, were intimately connected with each other,
penetrated into the heart of Italy, by the secure, though laborious,
navigation of the rivers and inland canals. Their vessels, which were
continually increasing in size and number, visited all the harbors of
the Gulf; and the marriage which Venice annually celebrates with the
Adriatic, was contracted in her early infancy. The epistle of
Cassiodorus, the Praetorian praefect, is addressed to the maritime
tribunes; and he exhorts them, in a mild tone of authority, to animate
the zeal of their countrymen for the public service, which required
their assistance to transport the magazines of wine and oil from the
province of Istria to the royal city of Ravenna. The ambiguous office of
these magistrates is explained by the tradition, that, in the twelve
principal islands, twelve tribunes, or judges, were created by an annual
and popular election. The existence of the Venetian republic under the
Gothic kingdom of Italy, is attested by the same authentic record, which
annihilates their lofty claim of original and perpetual independence.
^58</p></li>
<li><p>: The learned count Figliasi has proved, in his memoirs upon the
Veneti (Memorie de’ Veneti primi e secondi del conte Figliasi, t. vi.
Veneziai, 796,) that from the most remote period, this nation, which
occupied the country which has since been called the Venetian States or
Terra Firma, likewise inhabited the islands scattered upon the coast,
and that from thence arose the names of Venetia prima and secunda, of
which the first applied to the main land and the second to the islands
and lagunes. From the time of the Pelasgi and of the Etrurians, the
first Veneti, inhabiting a fertile and pleasant country, devoted
themselves to agriculture: the second, placed in the midst of canals, at
the mouth of several rivers, conveniently situated with regard to the
islands of Greece, as well as the fertile plains of Italy, applied
themselves to navigation and commerce. Both submitted to the Romans a
short time before the second Punic war; yet it was not till after the
victory of Marius over the Cimbri, that their country was reduced to a
Roman province. Under the emperors, Venetia Prima obtained more than
once, by its calamities, a place in history.</p></li>
<li><p>But the maritime province was occupied in salt works, fisheries,
and commerce. The Romans have considered the inhabitants of this part as
beneath the dignity of history, and have left them in
obscurity.</p></li>
<li><p>and his new favorite, the eunuch Heraclius, awakened the emperor
from the supine lethargy, which might be disguised, during the life of
Placidia, ^72 by the excuse of filial piety. The fame of Aetius, his
wealth and dignity, the numerous and martial train of Barbarian
followers, his powerful dependants, who filled the civil offices of the
state, and the hopes of his son Gaudentius, who was already contracted
to Eudoxia, the emperor’s daughter, had raised him above the rank of a
subject. The ambitious designs, of which he was secretly accused,
excited the fears, as well as the resentment, of Valentinian. Aetius
himself, supported by the consciousness of his merit, his services, and
perhaps his innocence, seems to have maintained a haughty and indiscreet
behavior. The patrician offended his sovereign by a hostile declaration;
he aggravated the offence, by compelling him to ratify, with a solemn
oath, a treaty of reconciliation and alliance; he proclaimed his
suspicions, he neglected his safety; and from a vain confidence that the
enemy, whom he despised, was incapable even of a manly crime, he rashly
ventured his person in the palace of Rome. Whilst he urged, perhaps with
intemperate vehemence, the marriage of his son; Valentinian, drawing his
sword, the first sword he had ever drawn, plunged it in the breast of a
general who had saved his empire: his courtiers and eunuchs ambitiously
struggled to imitate their master; and Aetius, pierced with a hundred
wounds, fell dead in the royal presence. Boethius, the Praetorian
praefect, was killed at the same moment, and before the event could be
divulged, the principal friends of the patrician were summoned to the
palace, and separately murdered. The horrid deed, palliated by the
specious names of justice and necessity, was immediately communicated by
the emperor to his soldiers, his subjects, and his allies. The nations,
who were strangers or enemies to Aetius, generously deplored the
unworthy fate of a hero: the Barbarians, who had been attached to his
service, dissembled their grief and resentment: and the public contempt,
which had been so long entertained for Valentinian, was at once
converted into deep and universal abhorrence. Such sentiments seldom
pervade the walls of a palace; yet the emperor was confounded by the
honest reply of a Roman, whose approbation he had not disdained to
solicit. “I am ignorant, sir, of your motives or provocations; I only
know, that you have acted like a man who cuts off his right hand with
his left.“ ^73</p></li>
<li><p>: The praises awarded by Gibbon to the character of Aetius have
been animadverted upon with great severity. (See Mr. Herbert’s Attila.
p. 321.) I am not aware that Gibbon has dissembled or palliated any of
the crimes or treasons of Aetius: but his position at the time of his
murder was certainly that of the preserver of the empire, the conqueror
of the most dangerous of the barbarians: it is by no means clear that he
was not “innocent“ of any treasonable designs against Valentinian. If
the early acts of his life, the introduction of the Huns into Italy, and
of the Vandals into Africa, were among the proximate causes of the ruin
of the empire, his murder was the signal for its almost immediate
downfall. - M.]</p></li>

Edecon had listened to a conspiracy against the life of his sovereign.
But this apparent guilt was expiated by his merit or repentance; his
rank was eminent and conspicuous; he enjoyed the favor of Attila; and
the troops under his command, who guarded, in their turn, the royal
village, consisted of a tribe of Scyrri, his immediate and hereditary
subjects. In the revolt of the nations, they still adhered to the Huns;

followers of their exile. Onulf directed his steps towards
Constantinople, where he sullied, by the assassination of a generous
benefactor, the fame which he had acquired in arms. His brother Odoacer
led a wandering life among the Barbarians of Noricum, with a mind and a
fortune suited to the most desperate adventures; and when he had fixed
his choice, he piously visited the cell of Severinus, the popular saint
of the country, to solicit his approbation and blessing. The lowness of
the door would not admit the lofty stature of Odoacer: he was obliged to
stoop; but in that humble attitude the saint could discern the symptoms
of his future greatness; and addressing him in a prophetic tone,
“Pursue“ (said he) “your design; proceed to Italy; you will soon cast

accepted and ratified the prediction, was admitted into the service of
the Western empire, and soon obtained an honorable rank in the guards.
His manners were gradually polished, his military skill was improved,
and the confederates of Italy would not have elected him for their
general, unless the exploits of Odoacer had established a high opinion
of his courage and capacity. ^122 Their military acclamations saluted
him with the title of king; but he abstained, during his whole reign,
from the use of the purple and diadem, ^123 lest he should offend those
princes, whose subjects, by their accidental mixture, had formed the
victorious army, which time and policy might insensibly unite into a
great nation.</p></li>

father of Odoacer, with the colleague of Orestes, is not conclusive.

<li><p>One third of those ample estates, to which the ruin of Italy is
originally imputed, ^142 was extorted for the use of the conquerors.
Injuries were aggravated by insults; the sense of actual sufferings was
imbittered by the fear of more dreadful evils; and as new lands were
allotted to the new swarms of Barbarians, each senator was apprehensive
lest the arbitrary surveyors should approach his favorite villa, or his
most profitable farm. The least unfortunate were those who submitted
without a murmur to the power which it was impossible to resist. Since
they desired to live, they owed some gratitude to the tyrant who had
spared their lives; and since he was the absolute master of their
fortunes, the portion which he left must be accepted as his pure and
voluntary gift. ^143 The distress of Italy ^! was mitigated by the
prudence and humanity of Odoacer, who had bound himself, as the price of
his elevation, to satisfy the demands of a licentious and turbulent
multitude. The kings of the Barbarians were frequently resisted,
deposed, or murdered, by their native subjects, and the various bands of
Italian mercenaries, who associated under the standard of an elective
general, claimed a larger privilege of freedom and rapine. A monarchy
destitute of national union, and hereditary right, hastened to its
dissolution. After a reign of fourteen years, Odoacer was oppressed by
the superior genius of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths; a hero alike
excellent in the arts of war and of government, who restored an age of
peace and prosperity, and whose name still excites and deserves the
attention of mankind.</p></li>
<li><p>: Denina supposes that the Barbarians were compelled by necessity
to turn their attention to agriculture. Italy, either imperfectly
cultivated, or not at all, by the indolent or ruined proprietors, not
only could not furnish the imposts, on which the pay of the soldiery
depended, but not even a certain supply of the necessaries of life. The
neighboring countries were now occupied by warlike nations; the supplies
of corn from Africa were cut off; foreign commerce nearly destroyed;
they could not look for supplies beyond the limits of Italy, throughout
which the agriculture had been long in a state of progressive but rapid
depression. (Denina, Rev. d’Italia t. v. c. i.) - M.]</p></li>

they despised; and the loudest applause was bestowed on this Divine
Philosophy, ^4 which surpassed, without the aid of science or reason,
the laborious virtues of the Grecian schools. The monks might indeed
contend with the Stoics, in the contempt of fortune, of pain, and of

servile discipline; and they disdained, as firmly as the Cynics
themselves, all the forms and decencies of civil society. But the

perfect model. They trod in the footsteps of the prophets, who had
retired to the desert; ^5 and they restored the devout and contemplative
life, which had been instituted by the Essenians, in Palestine and

proselyte of Ulphilas; while the haughty soul of Athanaric disdained the

tried by the persecution which he excited. A wagon, bearing aloft the
shapeless image of Thor, perhaps, or of Woden, was conducted in solemn
procession through the streets of the camp; and the rebels, who refused
to worship the god of their fathers, were immediately burnt, with their
tents and families. The character of Ulphilas recommended him to the
esteem of the Eastern court, where he twice appeared as the minister of
peace; he pleaded the cause of the distressed Goths, who implored the
protection of Valens; and the name of Moses was applied to this
spiritual guide, who conducted his people through the deep waters of the
Danube to the Land of Promise. ^76 The devout shepherds, who were

uniform rule of conduct on their various subjects, permitted each
people, and each family, of their empire, freely to enjoy their domestic

of this legal toleration. ^70 The children embraced the law of their

and ambition, kindled the flame of theological discord; the church, and
even the state, were distracted by religious factions, whose conflicts
were sometimes bloody, and always implacable; the attention of the
emperors was diverted from camps to synods; the Roman world was
oppressed by a new species of tyranny; and the persecuted sects became
the secret enemies of their country. Yet party spirit, however
pernicious or absurd, is a principle of union as well as of dissension.
The bishops, from eighteen hundred pulpits, inculcated the duty of
passive obedience to a lawful and orthodox sovereign; their frequent
assemblies, and perpetual correspondence, maintained the communion of
distant churches; and the benevolent temper of the gospel was
strengthened, though confined, by the spiritual alliance of the
Catholics. The sacred indolence of the monks was devoutly embraced by a
servile and effeminate age; but if superstition had not afforded a
decent retreat, the same vices would have tempted the unworthy Romans to
desert, from baser motives, the standard of the republic. Religious
precepts are easily obeyed, which indulge and sanctify the natural
inclinations of their votaries; but the pure and genuine influence of
Christianity may be traced in its beneficial, though imperfect, effects

Odoacer, the rights of conquest, the true interest of the Italians, and
the sacred duty of subsisting a whole people, who, on the faith of his
promises, had transported themselves into a distant land. ^26 Under the
reign of Theodoric, and in the happy climate of Italy, the Goths soon
multiplied to a formidable host of two hundred thousand men, ^27 and the
whole amount of their families may be computed by the ordinary addition
of women and children. Their invasion of property, a part of which must
have been already vacant, was disguised by the generous but improper
name of hospitality; these unwelcome guests were irregularly dispersed
over the face of Italy, and the lot of each Barbarian was adequate to
his birth and office, the number of his followers, and the rustic wealth
which he possessed in slaves and cattle. The distinction of noble and

<li><p>whose functions are painted in gaudy colors by the rhetoric of
Cassiodorus, still continued to act as the ministers of state. And the
subordinate care of justice and the revenue was delegated to seven
consulars, three correctors, and five presidents, who governed the
fifteen regions of Italy according to the principles, and even the
forms, of Roman jurisprudence. ^55 The violence of the conquerors was
abated or eluded by the slow artifice of judicial proceedings; the civil
administration, with its honors and emoluments, was confined to the
Italians; and the people still preserved their dress and language, their
laws and customs, their personal freedom, and two thirds of their landed
property. ^! It had been the object of Augustus to conceal the
introduction of monarchy; it was the policy of Theodoric to disguise the
reign of a Barbarian. ^56 If his subjects were sometimes awakened from
this pleasing vision of a Roman government, they derived more
substantial comfort from the character of a Gothic prince, who had
penetration to discern, and firmness to pursue, his own and the public
interest. Theodoric loved the virtues which he possessed, and the
talents of which he was destitute. Liberius was promoted to the office
of Praetorian praefect for his unshaken fidelity to the unfortunate
cause of Odoacer. The ministers of Theodoric, Cassiodorus, ^57 and
Boethius, have reflected on his reign the lustre of their genius and
learning. More prudent or more fortunate than his colleague, Cassiodorus
preserved his own esteem without forfeiting the royal favor; and after
passing thirty years in the honors of the world, he was blessed with an
equal term of repose in the devout and studious solitude of Squillace.

grandfather had distinguished himself in the defence of Sicily against
the ravages of Genseric; his father held a high rank at the court of
Valentinian III., enjoyed the friendship of Aetius, and was one of the
ambassadors sent to arrest the progress of Attila. Cassiodorus himself
was first the treasurer of the private expenditure to Odoacer,
afterwards “count of the sacred largesses.“ Yielding with the rest of
the Romans to the dominion of Theodoric, he was instrumental in the
peaceable submission of Sicily; was successively governor of his native
provinces of Bruttium and Lucania, quaestor, magister, palatii,
Praetorian praefect, patrician, consul, and private secretary, and, in
fact, first minister of the king. He was five times Praetorian praefect
under different sovereigns, the last time in the reign of Vitiges. This
is the theory of Manso, which is not unencumbered with difficulties. M.
Buat had supposed that it was the father of Cassiodorus who held the
office first named. Compare Manso, p. 85, andandandandc., and Beylage,

Catholics, who applauded the merit and patience of these holy
confessors. Three hundred pulpits deplored the persecution of the
church; and if the chapel of St. Stephen at Verona was demolished by the
command of Theodoric, it is probable that some miracle hostile to his
name and dignity had been performed on that sacred theatre. At the close
of a glorious life, the king of Italy discovered that he had excited the
hatred of a people whose happiness he had so assiduously labored to
promote; and his mind was soured by indignation, jealousy, and the
bitterness of unrequited love. The Gothic conqueror condescended to
disarm the unwarlike natives of Italy, interdicting all weapons of
offence, and excepting only a small knife for domestic use. The
deliverer of Rome was accused of conspiring with the vilest informers
against the lives of senators whom he suspected of a secret and
treasonable correspondence with the Byzantine court. ^87 After the death
of Anastasius, the diadem had been placed on the head of a feeble old
man; but the powers of government were assumed by his nephew Justinian,
who already meditated the extirpation of heresy, and the conquest of
Italy and Africa. A rigorous law, which was published at Constantinople,
to reduce the Arians by the dread of punishment within the pale of the
church, awakened the just resentment of Theodoric, who claimed for his
distressed brethren of the East the same indulgence which he had so long
granted to the Catholics of his dominions. ^! At his stern command, the
Roman pontiff, with four illustrious senators, embarked on an embassy,
of which he must have alike dreaded the failure or the success. The
singular veneration shown to the first pope who had visited
Constantinople was punished as a crime by his jealous monarch; the
artful or peremptory refusal of the Byzantine court might excuse an
equal, and would provoke a larger, measure of retaliation; and a mandate
was prepared in Italy, to prohibit, after a stated day, the exercise of
the Catholic worship. By the bigotry of his subjects and enemies, the
most tolerant of princes was driven to the brink of persecution; and the

the female sex, till the opulent citizens of Rome and the provinces were
insensibly familiarized with the example of Elagabalus, the first who,
by this effeminate habit, had sullied the dignity of an emperor and a

raised the value even above the standard of Aurelian, the manufacturers
of Tyre and Berytus were sometimes compelled, by the operation of the

resided in China, perhaps in the royal city of Nankin, the seat of a
monarch addicted to foreign superstitions, and who actually received an
embassy from the Isle of Ceylon. Amidst their pious occupations, they
viewed with a curious eye the common dress of the Chinese, the
manufactures of silk, and the myriads of silk-worms, whose education
(either on trees or in houses) had once been considered as the labor of
queens. ^75 They soon discovered that it was impracticable to transport
the short-lived insect, but that in the eggs a numerous progeny might be
preserved and multiplied in a distant climate. Religion or interest had
more power over the Persian monks than the love of their country: after
a long journey, they arrived at Constantinople, imparted their project
to the emperor, and were liberally encouraged by the gifts and promises
of Justinian. To the historians of that prince, a campaign at the foot
of Mount Caucasus has seemed more deserving of a minute relation than
the labors of these missionaries of commerce, who again entered China,
deceived a jealous people by concealing the eggs of the silk-worm in a
hollow cane, and returned in triumph with the spoils of the East. Under
their direction, the eggs were hatched at the proper season by the
artificial heat of dung; the worms were fed with mulberry leaves; they
lived and labored in a foreign climate; a sufficient number of
butterflies was saved to propagate the race, and trees were planted to
supply the nourishment of the rising generations. Experience and
reflection corrected the errors of a new attempt, and the Sogdoite
ambassadors acknowledged, in the succeeding reign, that the Romans were
not inferior to the natives of China in the education of the insects,
and the manufactures of silk, ^76 in which both China and Constantinople
have been surpassed by the industry of modern Europe. I am not
insensible of the benefits of elegant luxury; yet I reflect with some
pain, that if the importers of silk had introduced the art of printing,
already practised by the Chinese, the comedies of Menander and the
entire decads of Livy would have been perpetuated in the editions of the
sixth century.</p></li>

<li><p>Their gratitude universally applauded the abolition of the gold
of affliction, a personal tribute on the industry of the poor, ^78 but
more intolerable, as it should seem, in the form than in the substance,
since the flourishing city of Edessa paid only one hundred and forty
pounds of gold, which was collected in four years from ten thousand
artificers. ^79 Yet such was the parsimony which supported this liberal
disposition, that, in a reign of twenty-seven years, Anastasius saved,
from his annual revenue, the enormous sum of thirteen millions sterling,
or three hundred and twenty thousand pounds of gold. ^80 His example was
neglected, and his treasure was abused, by the nephew of Justin. The
riches of Justinian were speedily exhausted by alms and buildings, by
ambitious wars, and ignominious treaties. His revenues were found
inadequate to his expenses. Every art was tried to extort from the
people the gold and silver which he scattered with a lavish hand from
Persia to France: ^81 his reign was marked by the vicissitudes or rather
by the combat, of rapaciousness and avarice, of splendor and poverty; he
lived with the reputation of hidden treasures, ^82 and bequeathed to his
successor the payment of his debts. ^83 Such a character has been justly
accused by the voice of the people and of posterity: but public
discontent is credulous; private malice is bold; and a lover of truth
will peruse with a suspicious eye the instructive anecdotes of
Procopius. The secret historian represents only the vices of Justinian,
and those vices are darkened by his malevolent pencil. Ambiguous actions
are imputed to the worst motives; error is confounded with guilt,
accident with design, and laws with abuses; the partial injustice of a
moment is dexterously applied as the general maxim of a reign of
thirty-two years; the emperor alone is made responsible for the faults
of his officers, the disorders of the times, and the corruption of his
subjects; and even the calamities of nature, plagues, earthquakes, and
inundations, are imputed to the prince of the daemons, who had
mischievously assumed the form of Justinian. ^84</p></li>
<li><p>: See the character of Anastasius in Joannes Lydus de
Magistratibus, iii. c. 45, 46, p. 230 - 232. His economy is there said
to have degenerated into parsimony. He is accused of having taken away
the levying of taxes and payment of the troops from the municipal
authorities, (the decurionate) in the Eastern cities, and intrusted it
to an extortionate officer named Mannus.</p></li>
<li><p>which checked the fair competition of industry, and, for the sake
of a small and dishonest gain, imposed an arbitrary burden on the wants
and luxury of the subject. “As soon“ (I transcribe the Anecdotes) “as
the exclusive sale of silk was usurped by the Imperial treasurer, a
whole people, the manufacturers of Tyre and Berytus, was reduced to
extreme misery, and either perished with hunger, or fled to the hostile
dominions of Persia.“ A province might suffer by the decay of its
manufactures, but in this example of silk, Procopius has partially
overlooked the inestimable and lasting benefit which the empire received
from the curiosity of Justinian. His addition of one seventh to the
ordinary price of copper money may be interpreted with the same candor;
and the alteration, which might be wise, appears to have been innocent;
since he neither alloyed the purity, nor enhanced the value, of the gold
coin, ^87 the legal measure of public and private payments. V. The ample
jurisdiction required by the farmers of the revenue to accomplish their
engagements might be placed in an odious light, as if they had purchased
from the emperor the lives and fortunes of their fellow-citizens. And a
more direct sale of honors and offices was transacted in the palace,
with the permission, or at least with the connivance, of Justinian and
Theodora. The claims of merit, even those of favor, were disregarded,
and it was almost reasonable to expect, that the bold adventurer, who
had undertaken the trade of a magistrate, should find a rich
compensation for infamy, labor, danger, the debts which he had
contracted, and the heavy interest which he paid. A sense of the
disgrace and mischief of this venal practice, at length awakened the
slumbering virtue of Justinian; and he attempted, by the sanction of
oaths ^88 and penalties, to guard the integrity of his government: but
at the end of a year of perjury, his rigorous edict was suspended, and
corruption licentiously abused her triumph over the impotence of the
laws. VI. The testament of Eulalius, count of the domestics, declared
the emperor his sole heir, on condition, however, that he should
discharge his debts and legacies, allow to his three daughters a decent
maintenance, and bestow each of them in marriage, with a portion of ten
pounds of gold. But the splendid fortune of Eulalius had been consumed
by fire, and the inventory of his goods did not exceed the trifling sum
of five hundred and sixty-four pieces of gold. A similar instance, in
Grecian history, admonished the emperor of the honorable part prescribed
for his imitation. He checked the selfish murmurs of the treasury,
applauded the confidence of his friend, discharged the legacies and
debts, educated the three virgins under the eye of the empress Theodora,
and doubled the marriage portion which had satisfied the tenderness of
their father. ^89 The humanity of a prince (for princes cannot be
generous) is entitled to some praise; yet even in this act of virtue we
may discover the inveterate custom of supplanting the legal or natural
heirs, which Procopius imputes to the reign of Justinian. His charge is
supported by eminent names and scandalous examples; neither widows nor
orphans were spared; and the art of soliciting, or extorting, or
supposing testaments, was beneficially practised by the agents of the
palace. This base and mischievous tyranny invades the security of
private life; and the monarch who has indulged an appetite for gain,
will soon be tempted to anticipate the moment of succession, to
interpret wealth as an evidence of guilt, and to proceed, from the claim
of inheritance, to the power of confiscation. VII. Among the forms of
rapine, a philosopher may be permitted to name the conversion of Pagan
or heretical riches to the use of the faithful; but in the time of
Justinian this holy plunder was condemned by the sectaries alone, who
became the victims of his orthodox avarice. ^90</p></li>
<li><p>: Hullman (Geschichte des Byzantinischen Handels. p. 15) shows
that the despotism of the government was aggravated by the unchecked
rapenity of the officers. This state monopoly, even of corn, wine, and
oil, was to force at the time of the first crusade. - M.]</p></li>

eyes of the assailants. At length, in a silent night, they ascended the
most accessible tower, which was guarded only by some monks, oppressed,
after the duties of a festival, with sleep and wine. Scaling-ladders
were applied at the dawn of day; the presence of Cabades, his stern
command, and his drawn sword, compelled the Persians to vanquish; and
before it was sheathed, fourscore thousand of the inhabitants had
expiated the blood of their companions. After the siege of Amida, the
war continued three years, and the unhappy frontier tasted the full
measure of its calamities. The gold of Anastasius was offered too late,
the number of his troops was defeated by the number of their generals;
the country was stripped of its inhabitants, and both the living and the
dead were abandoned to the wild beasts of the desert. The resistance of
Edessa, and the deficiency of spoil, inclined the mind of Cabades to
peace: he sold his conquests for an exorbitant price; and the same line,
though marked with slaughter and devastation, still separated the two
empires. To avert the repetition of the same evils, Anastasius resolved
to found a new colony, so strong, that it should defy the power of the
Persian, so far advanced towards Assyria, that its stationary troops
might defend the province by the menace or operation of offensive war.
For this purpose, the town of Dara, ^137 fourteen miles from Nisibis,
and four days’ journey from the Tigris, was peopled and adorned; the
hasty works of Anastasius were improved by the perseverance of
Justinian; and, without insisting on places less important, the
fortifications of Dara may represent the military architecture of the
age. The city was surrounded with two walls, and the interval between
them, of fifty paces, afforded a retreat to the cattle of the besieged.
The inner wall was a monument of strength and beauty: it measured sixty
feet from the ground, and the height of the towers was one hundred feet;
the loopholes, from whence an enemy might be annoyed with missile
weapons, were small, but numerous; the soldiers were planted along the
rampart, under the shelter of double galleries, and a third platform,
spacious and secure, was raised on the summit of the towers. The
exterior wall appears to have been less lofty, but more solid; and each
tower was protected by a quadrangular bulwark. A hard, rocky soil
resisted the tools of the miners, and on the south-east, where the
ground was more tractable, their approach was retarded by a new work,
which advanced in the shape of a half-moon. The double and treble
ditches were filled with a stream of water; and in the management of the
river, the most skilful labor was employed to supply the inhabitants, to
distress the besiegers, and to prevent the mischiefs of a natural or
artificial inundation. Dara continued more than sixty years to fulfil
the wishes of its founders, and to provoke the jealousy of the Persians,
who incessantly complained, that this impregnable fortress had been
constructed in manifest violation of the treaty of peace between the two
empires. ^</p></li>

<li><p>: The situation (of Dara) does not appear to give it strength, as
it must have been commanded on three sides by the mountains, but opening
on the south towards the plains of Mesopotamia. The foundation of the
walls and towers, built of large hewn stone, may be traced across the
valley, and over a number of low rocky hills which branch out from the
foot of Mount Masius. The circumference I conceive to be nearly two
miles and a half; and a small stream, which flows through the middle of
the place, has induced several Koordish and Armenian families to fix
their residence within the ruins. Besides the walls and towers, the
remains of many other buildings attest the former grandeur of Dara; a
considerable part of the space within the walls is arched and vaulted
underneath, and in one place we perceived a large cavern, supported by
four ponderous columns, somewhat resembling the great cistern of
Constantinople. In the centre of the village are the ruins of a palace
(probably that mentioned by Procopius) or church, one hundred paces in
length, and sixty in breadth. The foundations, which are quite entire,
consist of a prodigious number of subterraneous vaulted chambers,
entered by a narrow passage forty paces in length. The gate is still
standing; a considerable part of the wall has bid defiance to time,

which opens from the northern side of Iberia, or Georgia, into the plain
that reaches to the Tanais and the Volga. A fortress, designed by
Alexander perhaps, or one of his successors, to command that important
pass, had descended by right of conquest or inheritance to a prince of
the Huns, who offered it for a moderate price to the emperor; but while
Anastasius paused, while he timorously computed the cost and the
distance, a more vigilant rival interposed, and Cabades forcibly
occupied the Straits of Caucasus. The Albanian and Iberian gates
excluded the horsemen of Scythia from the shortest and most practicable
roads, and the whole front of the mountains was covered by the rampart
of Gog and Magog, the long wall which has excited the curiosity of an
Arabian caliph ^140 and a Russian conqueror. ^141 According to a recent
description, huge stones, seven feet thick, and twenty-one feet in
length or height, are artificially joined without iron or cement, to
compose a wall, which runs above three hundred miles from the shores of
Derbend, over the hills, and through the valleys of Daghestan and
Georgia.</p></li>

<li><p>They turned their backs to the Euphrates, and their faces to the
enemy: innumerable arrows glanced without effect from the compact and
shelving order of their bucklers; an impenetrable line of pikes was
opposed to the repeated assaults of the Persian cavalry; and after a
resistance of many hours, the remaining troops were skilfully embarked
under the shadow of the night. The Persian commander retired with
disorder and disgrace, to answer a strict account of the lives of so
many soldiers, which he had consumed in a barren victory. But the fame
of Belisarius was not sullied by a defeat, in which he alone had saved
his army from the consequences of their own rashness: the approach of
peace relieved him from the guard of the eastern frontier, and his
conduct in the sedition of Constantinople amply discharged his
obligations to the emperor. When the African war became the topic of
popular discourse and secret deliberation, each of the Roman generals
was apprehensive, rather than ambitious, of the dangerous honor; but as
soon as Justinian had declared his preference of superior merit, their
envy was rekindled by the unanimous applause which was given to the
choice of Belisarius. The temper of the Byzantine court may encourage a
suspicion, that the hero was darkly assisted by the intrigues of his
wife, the fair and subtle Antonina, who alternately enjoyed the
confidence, and incurred the hatred, of the empress Theodora.</p></li>

<li><p>Three months after their departure from Constantinople, the men
and horses, the arms and military stores, were safely disembarked, and
five soldiers were left as a guard on board each of the ships, which
were disposed in the form of a semicircle. The remainder of the troops
occupied a camp on the sea- shore, which they fortified, according to
ancient discipline, with a ditch and rampart; and the discovery of a
source of fresh water, while it allayed the thirst, excited the
superstitious confidence, of the Romans. The next morning, some of the
neighboring gardens were pillaged; and Belisarius, after chastising the
offenders, embraced the slight occasion, but the decisive moment, of
inculcating the maxims of justice, moderation, and genuine policy. “When
I first accepted the commission of subduing Africa, I depended much
less,“ said the general, “on the numbers, or even the bravery of my
troops, than on the friendly disposition of the natives, and their
immortal hatred to the Vandals. You alone can deprive me of this hope;
if you continue to extort by rapine what might be purchased for a little
money, such acts of violence will reconcile these implacable enemies,
and unite them in a just and holy league against the invaders of their
country.“ These exhortations were enforced by a rigid discipline, of
which the soldiers themselves soon felt and praised the salutary
effects. The inhabitants, instead of deserting their houses, or hiding
their corn, supplied the Romans with a fair and liberal market: the
civil officers of the province continued to exercise their functions in
the name of Justinian: and the clergy, from motives of conscience and
interest, assiduously labored to promote the cause of a Catholic
emperor. The small town of Sullecte, ^17 one day’s journey from the
camp, had the honor of being foremost to open her gates, and to resume
her ancient allegiance: the larger cities of Leptis and Adrumetum
imitated the example of loyalty as soon as Belisarius appeared; and he
advanced without opposition as far as Grasse, a palace of the Vandal
kings, at the distance of fifty miles from Carthage. The weary Romans
indulged themselves in the refreshment of shady groves, cool fountains,
and delicious fruits; and the preference which Procopius allows to these
gardens over any that he had seen, either in the East or West, may be
ascribed either to the taste, or the fatigue, or the historian. In three
generations, prosperity and a warm climate had dissolved the hardy
virtue of the Vandals, who insensibly became the most luxurious of
mankind. In their villas and gardens, which might deserve the Persian
name of Paradise, ^18 they enjoyed a cool and elegant repose; and, after
the daily use of the bath, the Barbarians were seated at a table
profusely spread with the delicacies of the land and sea. Their silken
robes loosely flowing, after the fashion of the Medes, were embroidered
with gold; love and hunting were the labors of their life, and their
vacant hours were amused by pantomimes, chariot-races, and the music and
dances of the theatre.</p></li>

<li><p>and such forces, animated with valor and union, might have
crushed, at their first landing, the feeble and exhausted bands of the
Roman general. But the friends of the captive king were more inclined to
accept the invitations, than to resist the progress, of Belisarius; and
many a proud Barbarian disguised his aversion to war under the more
specious name of his hatred to the usurper. Yet the authority and
promises of Gelimer collected a formidable army, and his plans were
concerted with some degree of military skill. An order was despatched to
his brother Ammatas, to collect all the forces of Carthage, and to
encounter the van of the Roman army at the distance of ten miles from
the city: his nephew Gibamund, with two thousand horse, was destined to
attack their left, when the monarch himself, who silently followed,
should charge their rear, in a situation which excluded them from the
aid or even the view of their fleet. But the rashness of Ammatas was
fatal to himself and his country. He anticipated the hour of the attack,
outstripped his tardy followers, and was pierced with a mortal wound,
after he had slain with his own hand twelve of his boldest antagonists.
His Vandals fled to Carthage; the highway, almost ten miles, was strewed
with dead bodies; and it seemed incredible that such multitudes could be
slaughtered by the swords of three hundred Romans. The nephew of Gelimer
was defeated, after a slight combat, by the six hundred Massagetae: they
did not equal the third part of his numbers; but each Scythian was fired
by the example of his chief, who gloriously exercised the privilege of
his family, by riding, foremost and alone, to shoot the first arrow
against the enemy. In the mean while, Gelimer himself, ignorant of the
event, and misguided by the windings of the hills, inadvertently passed
the Roman army, and reached the scene of action where Ammatas had
fallen. He wept the fate of his brother and of Carthage, charged with
irresistible fury the advancing squadrons, and might have pursued, and
perhaps decided, the victory, if he had not wasted those inestimable
moments in the discharge of a vain, though pious, duty to the dead.
While his spirit was broken by this mournful office, he heard the
trumpet of Belisarius, who, leaving Antonina and his infantry in the
camp, pressed forwards with his guards and the remainder of the cavalry
to rally his flying troops, and to restore the fortune of the day. Much
room could not be found, in this disorderly battle, for the talents of a
general; but the king fled before the hero; and the Vandals, accustomed
only to a Moorish enemy, were incapable of withstanding the arms and
discipline of the Romans. Gelimer retired with hasty steps towards the
desert of Numidia: but he had soon the consolation of learning that his
private orders for the execution of Hilderic and his captive friends had
been faithfully obeyed. The tyrant’s revenge was useful only to his
enemies. The death of a lawful prince excited the compassion of his
people; his life might have perplexed the victorious Romans; and the
lieutenant of Justinian, by a crime of which he was innocent, was
relieved from the painful alternative of forfeiting his honor or
relinquishing his conquests.</p></li>

<li><p>who expressed a sanguine confidence that the king, after the
example of their ancestors, had already chastised the rashness of the
Roman invader. “Alas! my brother,“ replied Gelimer, “Heaven has declared
against our unhappy nation. While you have subdued Sardinia, we have
lost Africa. No sooner did Belisarius appear with a handful of soldiers,
than courage and prosperity deserted the cause of the Vandals. Your
nephew Gibamund, your brother Ammatas, have been betrayed to death by
the cowardice of their followers. Our horses, our ships, Carthage
itself, and all Africa, are in the power of the enemy. Yet the Vandals
still prefer an ignominious repose, at the expense of their wives and
children, their wealth and liberty. Nothing now remains, except the
fields of Bulla, and the hope of your valor. Abandon Sardinia; fly to
our relief; restore our empire, or perish by our side.“ On the receipt
of this epistle, Zano imparted his grief to the principal Vandals; but
the intelligence was prudently concealed from the natives of the island.
The troops embarked in one hundred and twenty galleys at the port of
Caghari, cast anchor the third day on the confines of Mauritania, and
hastily pursued their march to join the royal standard in the camp of
Bulla. Mournful was the interview: the two brothers embraced; they wept
in silence; no questions were asked of the Sardinian victory; no
inquiries were made of the African misfortunes: they saw before their
eyes the whole extent of their calamities; and the absence of their
wives and children afforded a melancholy proof that either death or
captivity had been their lot. The languid spirit of the Vandals was at
length awakened and united by the entreaties of their king, the example
of Zano, and the instant danger which threatened their monarchy and
religion. The military strength of the nation advanced to battle; and
such was the rapid increase, that before their army reached Tricameron,
about twenty miles from Carthage, they might boast, perhaps with some
exaggeration, that they surpassed, in a tenfold proportion, the
diminutive powers of the Romans. But these powers were under the command
of Belisarius; and, as he was conscious of their superior merit, he
permitted the Barbarians to surprise him at an unseasonable hour. The
Romans were instantly under arms; a rivulet covered their front; the
cavalry formed the first line, which Belisarius supported in the centre,
at the head of five hundred guards; the infantry, at some distance, was
posted in the second line; and the vigilance of the general watched the
separate station and ambiguous faith of the Massagetae, who secretly
reserved their aid for the conquerors. The historian has inserted, and
the reader may easily supply, the speeches ^21 of the commanders, who,
by arguments the most apposite to their situation, inculcated the
importance of victory, and the contempt of life. Zano, with the troops
which had followed him to the conquest of Sardinia, was placed in the
centre; and the throne of Genseric might have stood, if the multitude of
Vandals had imitated their intrepid resolution. Casting away their
lances and missile weapons, they drew their swords, and expected the
charge: the Roman cavalry thrice passed the rivulet; they were thrice
repulsed; and the conflict was firmly maintained, till Zano fell, and
the standard of Belisarius was displayed. Gelimer retreated to his camp;
the Huns joined the pursuit; and the victors despoiled the bodies of the
slain. Yet no more than fifty Romans, and eight hundred Vandals were
found on the field of battle; so inconsiderable was the carnage of a
day, which extinguished a nation, and transferred the empire of Africa.
In the evening Belisarius led his infantry to the attack of the camp;
and the pusillanimous flight of Gelimer exposed the vanity of his recent
declarations, that to the vanquished, death was a relief, life a burden,
and infamy the only object of terror. His departure was secret; but as
soon as the Vandals discovered that their king had deserted them, they
hastily dispersed, anxious only for their personal safety, and careless
of every object that is dear or valuable to mankind. The Romans entered
the camp without resistance; and the wildest scenes of disorder were
veiled in the darkness and confusion of the night. Every Barbarian who
met their swords was inhumanly massacred; their widows and daughters, as
rich heirs, or beautiful concubines, were embraced by the licentious
soldiers; and avarice itself was almost satiated with the treasures of
gold and silver, the accumulated fruits of conquest or economy in a long
period of prosperity and peace. In this frantic search, the troops, even
of Belisarius, forgot their caution and respect. Intoxicated with lust
and rapine, they explored, in small parties, or alone, the adjacent
fields, the woods, the rocks, and the caverns, that might possibly
conceal any desirable prize: laden with booty, they deserted their
ranks, and wandered without a guide, on the high road to Carthage; and
if the flying enemies had dared to return, very few of the conquerors
would have escaped. Deeply sensible of the disgrace and danger,
Belisarius passed an apprehensive night on the field of victory: at the
dawn of day, he planted his standard on a hill, recalled his guardians
and veterans, and gradually restored the modesty and obedience of the
camp. It was equally the concern of the Roman general to subdue the
hostile, and to save the prostrate, Barbarian; and the suppliant
Vandals, who could be found only in churches, were protected by his
authority, disarmed, and separately confined, that they might neither
disturb the public peace, nor become the victims of popular revenge.
After despatching a light detachment to tread the footsteps of Gelimer,
he advanced, with his whole army, about ten days’ march, as far as Hippo
Regius, which no longer possessed the relics of St. Augustin. ^22 The
season, and the certain intelligence that the Vandal had fled to an

<li><p>four thousand warriors, with those of Faesulae and the Cottian
Alps, were among the last who maintained their independence; and their
gallant resistance, which almost tired the patience, deserved the
esteem, of the conqueror. His prudence refused to subscribe the safe
conduct which they asked, to join their brethren of Ravenna; but they
saved, by an honorable capitulation, one moiety at least of their
wealth, with the free alternative of retiring peaceably to their
estates, or enlisting to serve the emperor in his Persian wars. The
multitudes which yet adhered to the standard of Vitiges far surpassed
the number of the Roman troops; but neither prayers nor defiance, nor
the extreme danger of his most faithful subjects, could tempt the Gothic
king beyond the fortifications of Ravenna. These fortifications were,
indeed, impregnable to the assaults of art or violence; and when
Belisarius invested the capital, he was soon convinced that famine only
could tame the stubborn spirit of the Barbarians. The sea, the land, and
the channels of the Po, were guarded by the vigilance of the Roman
general; and his morality extended the rights of war to the practice of
poisoning the waters, ^105 and secretly firing the granaries ^106 of a
besieged city. ^107 While he pressed the blockade of Ravenna, he was
surprised by the arrival of two ambassadors from Constantinople, with a
treaty of peace, which Justinian had imprudently signed, without
deigning to consult the author of his victory. By this disgraceful and
precarious agreement, Italy and the Gothic treasure were divided, and
the provinces beyond the Po were left with the regal title to the
successor of Theodoric. The ambassadors were eager to accomplish their
salutary commission; the captive Vitiges accepted, with transport, the
unexpected offer of a crown; honor was less prevalent among the Goths,
than the want and appetite of food; and the Roman chiefs, who murmured
at the continuance of the war, professed implicit submission to the
commands of the emperor. If Belisarius had possessed only the courage of
a soldier, the laurel would have been snatched from his hand by timid
and envious counsels; but in this decisive moment, he resolved, with the
magnanimity of a statesman, to sustain alone the danger and merit of
generous disobedience. Each of his officers gave a written opinion that
the siege of Ravenna was impracticable and hopeless: the general then
rejected the treaty of partition, and declared his own resolution of
leading Vitiges in chains to the feet of Justinian. The Goths retired
with doubt and dismay: this peremptory refusal deprived them of the only
signature which they could trust, and filled their minds with a just
apprehension, that a sagacious enemy had discovered the full extent of
their deplorable state. They compared the fame and fortune of Belisarius
with the weakness of their ill- fated king; and the comparison suggested
an extraordinary project, to which Vitiges, with apparent resignation,
was compelled to acquiesce. Partition would ruin the strength, exile
would disgrace the honor, of the nation; but they offered their arms,
their treasures, and the fortifications of Ravenna, if Belisarius would
disclaim the authority of a master, accept the choice of the Goths, and
assume, as he had deserved, the kingdom of Italy. If the false lustre of
a diadem could have tempted the loyalty of a faithful subject, his
prudence must have foreseen the inconstancy of the Barbarians, and his
rational ambition would prefer the safe and honorable station of a Roman
general. Even the patience and seeming satisfaction with which he
entertained a proposal of treason, might be susceptible of a malignant
interpretation. But the lieutenant of Justinian was conscious of his own
rectitude; he entered into a dark and crooked path, as it might lead to
the voluntary submission of the Goths; and his dexterous policy
persuaded them that he was disposed to comply with their wishes, without
engaging an oath or a promise for the performance of a treaty which he
secretly abhorred. The day of the surrender of Ravenna was stipulated by
the Gothic ambassadors: a fleet, laden with provisions, sailed as a
welcome guest into the deepest recess of the harbor: the gates were
opened to the fancied king of Italy; and Belisarius, without meeting an
enemy, triumphantly marched through the streets of an impregnable city.
^108 The Romans were astonished by their success; the multitudes of tall
and robust Barbarians were confounded by the image of their own patience
and the masculine females, spitting in the faces of their sons and
husbands, most bitterly reproached them for betraying their dominion and
freedom to these pygmies of the south, contemptible in their numbers,
diminutive in their stature. Before the Goths could recover from the
first surprise, and claim the accomplishment of their doubtful hopes,
the victor established his power in Ravenna, beyond the danger of
repentance and revolt.</p></li>

<li><p>As soon as the curiosity and impatience of Antonina were kindled,
the door of a bed-chamber was thrown open, and she beheld her lover,
whom the diligence of the eunuchs had discovered in his secret prison.
Her silent wonder burst into passionate exclamations of gratitude and
joy, and she named Theodora her queen, her benefactress, and her savior.
The monk of Ephesus was nourished in the palace with luxury and
ambition; but instead of assuming, as he was promised, the command of
the Roman armies, Theodosius expired in the first fatigues of an amorous
interview. ^! The grief of Antonina could only be assuaged by the
sufferings of her son. A youth of consular rank, and a sickly
constitution, was punished, without a trial, like a malefactor and a
slave: yet such was the constancy of his mind, that Photius sustained
the tortures of the scourge and the rack, ^!! without violating the
faith which he had sworn to Belisarius. After this fruitless cruelty,
the son of Antonina, while his mother feasted with the empress, was
buried in her subterraneous prisons, which admitted not the distinction
of night and day. He twice escaped to the most venerable sanctuaries of
Constantinople, the churches of St. Sophia, and of the Virgin: but his
tyrants were insensible of religion as of pity; and the helpless youth,
amidst the clamors of the clergy and people, was twice dragged from the
altar to the dungeon. His third attempt was more successful. At the end
of three years, the prophet Zachariah, or some mortal friend, indicated
the means of an escape: he eluded the spies and guards of the empress,
reached the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem, embraced the profession of a
monk; and the abbot Photius was employed, after the death of Justinian,
to reconcile and regulate the churches of Egypt. The son of Antonina
suffered all that an enemy can inflict: her patient husband imposed on
himself the more exquisite misery of violating his promise and deserting
his friend.</p></li>

<li><p>Like Romulus, the founder ^! of that martial people was suckled
by a she-wolf, who afterwards made him the father of a numerous progeny;
and the representation of that animal in the banners of the Turks
preserved the memory, or rather suggested the idea, of a fable, which
was invented, without any mutual intercourse, by the shepherds of Latium
and those of Scythia. At the equal distance of two thousand miles from
the Caspian, the Icy, the Chinese, and the Bengal Seas, a ridge of
mountains is conspicuous, the centre, and perhaps the summit, of Asia;
which, in the language of different nations, has been styled Imaus, and
Caf, ^23 and Altai, and the Golden Mountains, ^!! and the Girdle of the
Earth. The sides of the hills were productive of minerals; and the iron
forges, ^24 for the purpose of war, were exercised by the Turks, the
most despised portion of the slaves of the great khan of the Geougen.
But their servitude could only last till a leader, bold and eloquent,
should arise to persuade his countrymen that the same arms which they
forged for their masters, might become, in their own hands, the
instruments of freedom and victory. They sallied from the mountains; ^25
a sceptre was the reward of his advice; and the annual ceremony, in
which a piece of iron was heated in the fire, and a smith’s hammer

conquest, by their faithful attachment to the mountain of their fathers.
The royal encampment seldom lost sight of Mount Altai, from whence the
River Irtish descends to water the rich pastures of the Calmucks, ^26
which nourish the largest sheep and oxen in the world. The soil is
fruitful, and the climate mild and temperate: the happy region was
ignorant of earthquake and pestilence; the emperor’s throne was turned
towards the East, and a golden wolf on the top of a spear seemed to
guard the entrance of his tent. One of the successors of Bertezena was
tempted by the luxury and superstition of China; but his design of
building cities and temples was defeated by the simple wisdom of a
Barbarian counsellor. “The Turks,“ he said, “are not equal in number to
one hundredth part of the inhabitants of China. If we balance their
power, and elude their armies, it is because we wander without any fixed

<li><p>on the banks of the River Til, which derived the epithet of Black
from its dark water or gloomy forests. ^31 The khan of the Ogors was
slain with three hundred thousand of his subjects, and their bodies were
scattered over the space of four days’ journey: their surviving
countrymen acknowledged the strength and mercy of the Turks; and a small
portion, about twenty thousand warriors, preferred exile to servitude.
They followed the well-known road of the Volga, cherished the error of
the nations who confounded them with the Avars, and spread the terror of
that false though famous appellation, which had not, however, saved its
lawful proprietors from the yoke of the Turks. ^32 After a long and
victorious march, the new Avars arrived at the foot of Mount Caucasus,
in the country of the Alani ^33 and Circassians, where they first heard
of the splendor and weakness of the Roman empire. They humbly requested
their confederate, the prince of the Alani, to lead them to this source
of riches; and their ambassador, with the permission of the governor of
Lazica, was transported by the Euxine Sea to Constantinople. The whole
city was poured forth to behold with curiosity and terror the aspect of
a strange people: their long hair, which hung in tresses down their
backs, was gracefully bound with ribbons, but the rest of their habit
appeared to imitate the fashion of the Huns. When they were admitted to
the audience of Justinian, Candish, the first of the ambassadors,
addressed the Roman emperor in these terms: “You see before you, O
mighty prince, the representatives of the strongest and most populous of
nations, the invincible, the irresistible Avars. We are willing to
devote ourselves to your service: we are able to vanquish and destroy
all the enemies who now disturb your repose. But we expect, as the price
of our alliance, as the reward of our valor, precious gifts, annual
subsidies, and fruitful possessions.“ At the time of this embassy,
Justinian had reigned above thirty, he had lived above seventy-five
years: his mind, as well as his body, was feeble and languid; and the
conqueror of Africa and Italy, careless of the permanent interest of his
people, aspired only to end his days in the bosom even of inglorious
peace. In a studied oration, he imparted to the senate his resolution to
dissemble the insult, and to purchase the friendship of the Avars; and
the whole senate, like the mandarins of China, applauded the
incomparable wisdom and foresight of their sovereign. The instruments of
luxury were immediately prepared to captivate the Barbarians; silken
garments, soft and splendid beds, and chains and collars incrusted with
gold. The ambassadors, content with such liberal reception, departed
from Constantinople, and Valentin, one of the emperor’s guards, was sent
with a similar character to their camp at the foot of Mount Caucasus. As
their destruction or their success must be alike advantageous to the
empire, he persuaded them to invade the enemies of Rome; and they were
easily tempted, by gifts and promises, to gratify their ruling
inclinations. These fugitives, who fled before the Turkish arms, passed
the Tanais and Borysthenes, and boldly advanced into the heart of Poland
and Germany, violating the law of nations, and abusing the rights of
victory. Before ten years had elapsed, their camps were seated on the
Danube and the Elbe, many Bulgarian and Sclavonian names were
obliterated from the earth, and the remainder of their tribes are found,
as tributaries and vassals, under the standard of the Avars. The chagan,
the peculiar title of their king, still affected to cultivate the
friendship of the emperor; and Justinian entertained some thoughts of
fixing them in Pannonia, to balance the prevailing power of the
Lombards. But the virtue or treachery of an Avar betrayed the secret
enmity and ambitious designs of their countrymen; and they loudly
complained of the timid, though jealous policy, of detaining their
ambassadors, and denying the arms which they had been allowed to
purchase in the capital of the empire. ^34</p></li>
<li><p>: The Ogors or Varchonites, from Var. a river, (obviously
connected with the name Avar,) must not be confounded with the Uigours,
the eastern Turks, (v. Hammer, Osmanische Geschichte, vol. i. p. 3,) who
speak a language the parent of the more modern Turkish dialects. Compare
Klaproth, page 121. They are the ancestors of the Usbeck Turks. These
Ogors were of the same Finnish race with the Huns; and the 20,000
families which fled towards the west, after the Turkish invasion, were
of the same race with those which remained to the east of the Volga, the
true Avars of Theophy fact. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>they were introduced to the presence of Disabul. In a valley of
the Golden Mountain, they found the great khan in his tent, seated in a
chair with wheels, to which a horse might be occasionally harnessed. As
soon as they had delivered their presents, which were received by the
proper officers, they exposed, in a florid oration, the wishes of the
Roman emperor, that victory might attend the arms of the Turks, that
their reign might be long and prosperous, and that a strict alliance,
without envy or deceit, might forever be maintained between the two most
powerful nations of the earth. The answer of Disabul corresponded with
these friendly professions, and the ambassadors were seated by his side,
at a banquet which lasted the greatest part of the day: the tent was
surrounded with silk hangings, and a Tartar liquor was served on the
table, which possessed at least the intoxicating qualities of wine. The
entertainment of the succeeding day was more sumptuous; the silk
hangings of the second tent were embroidered in various figures; and the
royal seat, the cups, and the vases, were of gold. A third pavilion was
supported by columns of gilt wood; a bed of pure and massy gold was
raised on four peacocks of the same metal: and before the entrance of
the tent, dishes, basins, and statues of solid silver, and admirable
art, were ostentatiously piled in wagons, the monuments of valor rather
than of industry. When Disabul led his armies against the frontiers of
Persia, his Roman allies followed many days the march of the Turkish
camp, nor were they dismissed till they had enjoyed their precedency
over the envoy of the great king, whose loud and intemperate clamors
interrupted the silence of the royal banquet. The power and ambition of
Chosroes cemented the union of the Turks and Romans, who touched his
dominions on either side: but those distant nations, regardless of each
other, consulted the dictates of interest, without recollecting the
obligations of oaths and treaties. While the successor of Disabul
celebrated his father’s obsequies, he was saluted by the ambassadors of
the emperor Tiberius, who proposed an invasion of Persia, and sustained,
with firmness, the angry and perhaps the just reproaches of that haughty
Barbarian. “You see my ten fingers,“ said the great khan, and he applied
them to his mouth. “You Romans speak with as many tongues, but they are
tongues of deceit and perjury. To me you hold one language, to my
subjects another; and the nations are successively deluded by your
perfidious eloquence. You precipitate your allies into war and danger,
you enjoy their labors, and you neglect your benefactors. Hasten your
return, inform your master that a Turk is incapable of uttering or
forgiving falsehood, and that he shall speedily meet the punishment
which he deserves. While he solicits my friendship with flattering and
hollow words, he is sunk to a confederate of my fugitive Varchonites. If
I condescend to march against those contemptible slaves, they will
tremble at the sound of our whips; they will be trampled, like a nest of
ants, under the feet of my innumerable cavalry. I am not ignorant of the
road which they have followed to invade your empire; nor can I be
deceived by the vain pretence, that Mount Caucasus is the impregnable
barrier of the Romans. I know the course of the Niester, the Danube, and
the Hebrus; the most warlike nations have yielded to the arms of the
Turks; and from the rising to the setting sun, the earth is my
inheritance.“ Notwithstanding this menace, a sense of mutual advantage
soon renewed the alliance of the Turks and Romans: but the pride of the
great khan survived his resentment; and when he announced an important
conquest to his friend the emperor Maurice, he styled himself the master
of the seven races, and the lord of the seven climates of the world.
^37</p></li>
<li><p>: This rite is so curious, that I have subjoined the description
of it: -</p></li>
<li><p>the hope of peace inclined the Byzantine court to accept this
singular proposal; and Chosroes might have acquired a specious claim to
the inheritance of his Roman parent. But the future mischief was
diverted by the advice of the quaestor Proclus: a difficulty was
started, whether the adoption should be performed as a civil or military
rite; ^41 the treaty was abruptly dissolved; and the sense of this
indignity sunk deep into the mind of Chosroes, who had already advanced
to the Tigris on his road to Constantinople. His father did not long
survive the disappointment of his wishes: the testament of their
deceased sovereign was read in the assembly of the nobles; and a
powerful faction, prepared for the event, and regardless of the priority
of age, exalted Chosroes to the throne of Persia. He filled that throne
during a prosperous period of forty-eight years; ^42 and the Justice of
Nushirvan is celebrated as the theme of immortal praise by the nations
of the East.</p></li>
<li><p>: St. Martin questions this adoption: he urges its improbability;
and supposes that Procopius, perverting some popular traditions, or the
remembrance of some fruitless negotiations which took place at that
time, has mistaken, for a treaty of adoption some treaty of guaranty or
protection for the purpose of insuring the crown, after the death of
Kobad, to his favorite son Chosroes, vol. viii. p. 32. Yet the Greek
historians seem unanimous as to the proposal: the Persians might be
expected to maintain silence on such a subject. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>chastisement of the fanatics or impostors confirmed the domestic
rights of society. Instead of listening with blind confidence to a
favorite minister, he established four viziers over the four great
provinces of his empire, Assyria, Media, Persia, and Bactriana. In the
choice of judges, praefects, and counsellors, he strove to remove the
mask which is always worn in the presence of kings: he wished to
substitute the natural order of talents for the accidental distinctions
of birth and fortune; he professed, in specious language, his intention
to prefer those men who carried the poor in their bosoms, and to banish
corruption from the seat of justice, as dogs were excluded from the
temples of the Magi. The code of laws of the first Artaxerxes was
revived and published as the rule of the magistrates; but the assurance
of speedy punishment was the best security of their virtue. Their
behavior was inspected by a thousand eyes, their words were overheard by
a thousand ears, the secret or public agents of the throne; and the
provinces, from the Indian to the Arabian confines, were enlightened by
the frequent visits of a sovereign, who affected to emulate his
celestial brother in his rapid and salutary career. Education and
agriculture he viewed as the two objects most deserving of his care. In
every city of Persia orphans, and the children of the poor, were
maintained and instructed at the public expense; the daughters were
given in marriage to the richest citizens of their own rank, and the
sons, according to their different talents, were employed in mechanic
trades, or promoted to more honorable service. The deserted villages
were relieved by his bounty; to the peasants and farmers who were found
incapable of cultivating their lands, he distributed cattle, seed, and
the instruments of husbandry; and the rare and inestimable treasure of
fresh water was parsimoniously managed, and skilfully dispersed over the
arid territory of Persia. ^44 The prosperity of that kingdom was the
effect and evidence of his virtues; his vices are those of Oriental
despotism; but in the long competition between Chosroes and Justinian,
the advantage both of merit and fortune is almost always on the side of
the Barbarian. ^45</p></li>

<li><p>presumed to arrest the progress of the great king. The gates of
Dura, by treachery and surprise, were burst open; and as soon as
Chosroes had stained his cimeter with the blood of the inhabitants, he
dismissed the ambassador of Justinian to inform his master in what place
he had left the enemy of the Romans. The conqueror still affected the
praise of humanity and justice; and as he beheld a noble matron with her
infant rudely dragged along the ground, he sighed, he wept, and implored
the divine justice to punish the author of these calamities. Yet the
herd of twelve thousand captives was ransomed for two hundred pounds of
gold; the neighboring bishop of Sergiopolis pledged his faith for the
payment: and in the subsequent year the unfeeling avarice of Chosroes
exacted the penalty of an obligation which it was generous to contract
and impossible to discharge. He advanced into the heart of Syria: but a
feeble enemy, who vanished at his approach, disappointed him of the
honor of victory; and as he could not hope to establish his dominion,
the Persian king displayed in this inroad the mean and rapacious vices
of a robber. Hierapolis, Berrhaea or Aleppo, Apamea and Chalcis, were
successively besieged: they redeemed their safety by a ransom of gold or
silver, proportioned to their respective strength and opulence; and
their new master enforced, without observing, the terms of capitulation.
Educated in the religion of the Magi, he exercised, without remorse, the
lucrative trade of sacrilege; and, after stripping of its gold and gems
a piece of the true cross, he generously restored the naked relic to the
devotion of the Christians of Apamea. No more than fourteen years had
elapsed since Antioch was ruined by an earthquake; ^! but the queen of
the East, the new Theopolis, had been raised from the ground by the
liberality of Justinian; and the increasing greatness of the buildings
and the people already erased the memory of this recent disaster. On one
side, the city was defended by the mountain, on the other by the River
Orontes; but the most accessible part was commanded by a superior
eminence: the proper remedies were rejected, from the despicable fear of
discovering its weakness to the enemy; and Germanus, the emperor’s
nephew, refused to trust his person and dignity within the walls of a
besieged city. The people of Antioch had inherited the vain and
satirical genius of their ancestors: they were elated by a sudden
reenforcement of six thousand soldiers; they disdained the offers of an
easy capitulation and their intemperate clamors insulted from the
ramparts the majesty of the great king. Under his eye the Persian
myriads mounted with scaling-ladders to the assault; the Roman
mercenaries fled through the opposite gate of Daphne; and the generous
assistance of the youth of Antioch served only to aggravate the miseries
of their country. As Chosroes, attended by the ambassadors of Justinian,
was descending from the mountain, he affected, in a plaintive voice, to
deplore the obstinacy and ruin of that unhappy people; but the slaughter
still raged with unrelenting fury; and the city, at the command of a
Barbarian, was delivered to the flames. The cathedral of Antioch was
indeed preserved by the avarice, not the piety, of the conqueror: a more
honorable exemption was granted to the church of St. Julian, and the
quarter of the town where the ambassadors resided; some distant streets
were saved by the shifting of the wind, and the walls still subsisted to
protect, and soon to betray, their new inhabitants. Fanaticism had
defaced the ornaments of Daphne, but Chosroes breathed a purer air
amidst her groves and fountains; and some idolaters in his train might
sacrifice with impunity to the nymphs of that elegant retreat. Eighteen
miles below Antioch, the River Orontes falls into the Mediterranean. The
haughty Persian visited the term of his conquests; and, after bathing
alone in the sea, he offered a solemn sacrifice of thanksgiving to the
sun, or rather to the Creator of the sun, whom the Magi adored. If this
act of superstition offended the prejudices of the Syrians, they were
pleased by the courteous and even eager attention with which he assisted
at the games of the circus; and as Chosroes had heard that the blue
faction was espoused by the emperor, his peremptory command secured the
victory of the green charioteer. From the discipline of his camp the
people derived more solid consolation; and they interceded in vain for
the life of a soldier who had too faithfully copied the rapine of the
just Nushirvan. At length, fatigued, though unsatiated, with the spoil

<li><p>The king of the Lazi had been educated in the Christian religion;
his mother was the daughter of a senator; during his youth he had served
ten years a silentiary of the Byzantine palace, ^87 and the arrears of
an unpaid salary were a motive of attachment as well as of complaint.
But the long continuance of his sufferings extorted from him a naked
representation of the truth; and truth was an unpardonable libel on the
lieutenants of Justinian, who, amidst the delays of a ruinous war, had
spared his enemies and trampled on his allies. Their malicious
information persuaded the emperor that his faithless vassal already
meditated a second defection: an order was surprised to send him
prisoner to Constantinople; a treacherous clause was inserted, that he
might be lawfully killed in case of resistance; and Gubazes, without
arms, or suspicion of danger, was stabbed in the security of a friendly
interview. In the first moments of rage and despair, the Colchians would
have sacrificed their country and religion to the gratification of
revenge. But the authority and eloquence of the wiser few obtained a
salutary pause: the victory of the Phasis restored the terror of the
Roman arms, and the emperor was solicitous to absolve his own name from
the imputation of so foul a murder. A judge of senatorial rank was
commissioned to inquire into the conduct and death of the king of the
Lazi. He ascended a stately tribunal, encompassed by the ministers of
justice and punishment: in the presence of both nations, this

jurisprudence, and some satisfaction was granted to an injured people,

<li><p>The example of Stoza, and the assurance that a fortunate soldier
had been the first king, encouraged the ambition of Gontharis, and he
promised, by a private treaty, to divide Africa with the Moors, if, with
their dangerous aid, he should ascend the throne of Carthage. The feeble
Areobindus, unskilled in the affairs of peace and war, was raised, by
his marriage with the niece of Justinian, to the office of exarch. He
was suddenly oppressed by a sedition of the guards, and his abject
supplications, which provoked the contempt, could not move the pity, of
the inexorable tyrant. After a reign of thirty days, Gontharis himself
was stabbed at a banquet by the hand of Artaban; ^</p></li>
<li><p>and it is singular enough, that an Armenian prince, of the royal
family of Arsaces, should reestablish at Carthage the authority of the
Roman empire. In the conspiracy which unsheathed the dagger of Brutus
against the life of Caesar, every circumstance is curious and important
to the eyes of posterity; but the guilt or merit of these loyal or
rebellious assassins could interest only the contemporaries of
Procopius, who, by their hopes and fears, their friendship or
resentment, were personally engaged in the revolutions of Africa.

<li><p>: Corippus gives a different account of the death of Stoza; he
was transfixed by an arrow from the hand of John, (not the hero of his
poem) who broke desperately through the victorious troops of the enemy.
Stoza repented, says the poet, of his treasonous rebellion, and
anticipated - another Cataline - eternal torments as his
punishment.</p></li>
<li><p>: This murder was prompted to the Armenian (according to
Corippus) by Athanasius, (then praefect of Africa.)</p></li>
<li><p>The arrival of fresh troops and more skilful commanders soon
checked the insolence of the Moors: seventeen of their princes were
slain in the same battle; and the doubtful and transient submission of
their tribes was celebrated with lavish applause by the people of
Constantinople. Successive inroads had reduced the province of Africa to
one third of the measure of Italy; yet the Roman emperors continued to
reign above a century over Carthage and the fruitful coast of the
Mediterranean. But the victories and the losses of Justinian were alike
pernicious to mankind; and such was the desolation of Africa, that in
many parts a stranger might wander whole days without meeting the face
either of a friend or an enemy. The nation of the Vandals had
disappeared: they once amounted to a hundred and sixty thousand
warriors, without including the children, the women, or the slaves.
Their numbers were infinitely surpassed by the number of the Moorish
families extirpated in a relentless war; and the same destruction was
retaliated on the Romans and their allies, who perished by the climate,
their mutual quarrels, and the rage of the Barbarians. When Procopius
first landed, he admired the populousness of the cities and country,
strenuously exercised in the labors of commerce and agriculture. In less
than twenty years, that busy scene was converted into a silent solitude;
the wealthy citizens escaped to Sicily and Constantinople; and the
secret historian has confidently affirmed, that five millions of
Africans were consumed by the wars and government of the emperor
Justinian. ^5</p></li>

Ravenna, Florence, and Rome, and marched through the heart of Italy, to
form the siege or rather the blockade, of Naples. The Roman chiefs,
imprisoned in their respective cities, and accusing each other of the
common disgrace, did not presume to disturb his enterprise. But the
emperor, alarmed by the distress and danger of his Italian conquests,
despatched to the relief of Naples a fleet of galleys and a body of
Thracian and Armenian soldiers. They landed in Sicily, which yielded its
copious stores of provisions; but the delays of the new commander, an
unwarlike magistrate, protracted the sufferings of the besieged; and the
succors, which he dropped with a timid and tardy hand, were successively
intercepted by the armed vessels stationed by Totila in the Bay of
Naples. The principal officer of the Romans was dragged, with a rope
round his neck, to the foot of the wall, from whence, with a trembling
voice, he exhorted the citizens to implore, like himself, the mercy of
the conqueror. They requested a truce, with a promise of surrendering
the city, if no effectual relief should appear at the end of thirty
days. Instead of one month, the audacious Barbarian granted them three,
in the just confidence that famine would anticipate the term of their
capitulation. After the reduction of Naples and Cumae, the provinces of
Lucania, Apulia, and Calabria, submitted to the king of the Goths.
Totila led his army to the gates of Rome, pitched his camp at Tibur, or
Tivoli, within twenty miles of the capital, and calmly exhorted the
senate and people to compare the tyranny of the Greeks with the
blessings of the Gothic reign.</p></li>

Goths escaped from this unfortunate conflict. They affected to

transported their dying monarch seven miles beyond the scene of his
disgrace; and his last moments were not imbittered by the presence of an
enemy. Compassion afforded him the shelter of an obscure tomb; but the
Romans were not satisfied of their victory, till they beheld the corpse
of the Gothic king. His hat, enriched with gems, and his bloody robe,

<li><p>The death of Fulcaris, and the retreat of the surviving chiefs,
decided the fluctuating and rebellious temper of the Goths; they flew to
the standard of their deliverers, and admitted them into the cities
which still resisted the arms of the Roman general. The conqueror of
Italy opened a free passage to the irresistible torrent of Barbarians.
They passed under the walls of Cesena, and answered by threats and
reproaches the advice of Aligern, ^! that the Gothic treasures could no
longer repay the labor of an invasion. Two thousand Franks were
destroyed by the skill and valor of Narses himself, who sailed from
Rimini at the head of three hundred horse, to chastise the licentious
rapine of their march. On the confines of Samnium the two brothers
divided their forces. With the right wing, Buccelin assumed the spoil of
Campania, Lucania, and Bruttium; with the left, Lothaire accepted the
plunder of Apulia and Calabria. They followed the coast of the
Mediterranean and the Adriatic, as far as Rhegium and Otranto, and the
extreme lands of Italy were the term of their destructive progress. The
Franks, who were Christians and Catholics, contented themselves with
simple pillage and occasional murder. But the churches which their piety
had spared, were stripped by the sacrilegious hands of the Alamanni, who
sacrificed horses’ heads to their native deities of the woods and
rivers; ^49 they melted or profaned the consecrated vessels, and the
ruins of shrines and altars were stained with the blood of the faithful.
Buccelin was actuated by ambition, and Lothaire by avarice. The former
aspired to restore the Gothic kingdom; the latter, after a promise to
his brother of speedy succors, returned by the same road to deposit his
treasure beyond the Alps. The strength of their armies was already
wasted by the change of climate and contagion of disease: the Germans
revelled in the vintage of Italy; and their own intemperance avenged, in
some degree, the miseries of a defenceless people. ^</p></li>

<li><p>The savage chief passed, without opposition, the river and the
mountains, spread his troops over Macedonia and Thrace, and advanced
with no more than seven thousand horse to the long wall, which should
have defended the territory of Constantinople. But the works of man are
impotent against the assaults of nature: a recent earthquake had shaken
the foundations of the wall; and the forces of the empire were employed
on the distant frontiers of Italy, Africa, and Persia. The seven
schools, ^61 or companies of the guards or domestic troops, had been
augmented to the number of five thousand five hundred men, whose
ordinary station was in the peaceful cities of Asia. But the places of
the brave Armenians were insensibly supplied by lazy citizens, who
purchased an exemption from the duties of civil life, without being
exposed to the dangers of military service. Of such soldiers, few could
be tempted to sally from the gates; and none could be persuaded to
remain in the field, unless they wanted strength and speed to escape
from the Bulgarians. The report of the fugitives exaggerated the numbers
and fierceness of an enemy, who had polluted holy virgins, and abandoned
new-born infants to the dogs and vultures; a crowd of rustics, imploring
food and protection, increased the consternation of the city, and the
tents of Zabergan were pitched at the distance of twenty miles, ^62 on
the banks of a small river, which encircles Melanthias, and afterwards
falls into the Propontis. ^63 Justinian trembled: and those who had only
seen the emperor in his old age, were pleased to suppose, that he had
lost the alacrity and vigor of his youth. By his command the vessels of
gold and silver were removed from the churches in the neighborhood, and
even the suburbs, of Constantinople; the ramparts were lined with
trembling spectators; the golden gate was crowded with useless generals
and tribunes, and the senate shared the fatigues and the apprehensions
of the populace.</p></li>

<li><p>A wise Ephesian was driven by envy from his native country:
before he could reach the shores of Latium, he had observed the various
forms of human nature and civil society: he imparted his knowledge to
the legislators of Rome, and a statue was erected in the forum to the
perpetual memory of Hermodorus. ^13 The names and divisions of the
copper money, the sole coin of the infant state, were of Dorian origin:
^14 the harvests of Campania and Sicily relieved the wants of a people
whose agriculture was often interrupted by war and faction; and since
the trade was established, ^15 the deputies who sailed from the Tyber
might return from the same harbors with a more precious cargo of
political wisdom. The colonies of Great Greece had transported and
improved the arts of their mother country. Cumae and Rhegium, Crotona
and Tarentum, Agrigentum and Syracuse, were in the rank of the most
flourishing cities. The disciples of Pythagoras applied philosophy to
the use of government; the unwritten laws of Charondas accepted the aid
of poetry and music, ^16 and Zaleucus framed the republic of the
Locrians, which stood without alteration above two hundred years. ^17
From a similar motive of national pride, both Livy and Dionysius are
willing to believe, that the deputies of Rome visited Athens under the
wise and splendid administration of Pericles; and the laws of Solon were
transfused into the twelve tables. If such an embassy had indeed been
received from the Barbarians of Hesperia, the Roman name would have been
familiar to the Greeks before the reign of Alexander; ^18 and the
faintest evidence would have been explored and celebrated by the
curiosity of succeeding times. But the Athenian monuments are silent;
nor will it seem credible that the patricians should undertake a long
and perilous navigation to copy the purest model of democracy. In the
comparison of the tables of Solon with those of the Decemvirs, some
casual resemblance may be found; some rules which nature and reason have
revealed to every society; some proofs of a common descent from Egypt or
Phoenicia. ^19 But in all the great lines of public and private
jurisprudence, the legislators of Rome and Athens appear to be strangers
or adverse at each other.</p></li>
<li><p>: Compare Niebuhr, 355, note 720. - M. It is a most important

<li><p>As soon as he ascended his tribunal, he announced by the voice of
the crier, and afterwards inscribed on a white wall, the rules which he
proposed to follow in the decision of doubtful cases, and the relief
which his equity would afford from the precise rigor of ancient
statutes. A principle of discretion more congenial to monarchy was
introduced into the republic: the art of respecting the name, and
eluding the efficacy, of the laws, was improved by successive praetors;
subtleties and fictions were invented to defeat the plainest meaning of
the Decemvirs, and where the end was salutary, the means were frequently
absurd. The secret or probable wish of the dead was suffered to prevail
over the order of succession and the forms of testaments; and the
claimant, who was excluded from the character of heir, accepted with
equal pleasure from an indulgent praetor the possession of the goods of
his late kinsman or benefactor. In the redress of private wrongs,
compensations and fines were substituted to the obsolete rigor of the
Twelve Tables; time and space were annihilated by fanciful suppositions;
and the plea of youth, or fraud, or violence, annulled the obligation,
or excused the performance, of an inconvenient contract. A jurisdiction
thus vague and arbitrary was exposed to the most dangerous abuse: the
substance, as well as the form, of justice were often sacrificed to the
prejudices of virtue, the bias of laudable affection, and the grosser
seductions of interest or resentment. But the errors or vices of each
praetor expired with his annual office; such maxims alone as had been
approved by reason and practice were copied by succeeding judges; the
rule of proceeding was defined by the solution of new cases; and the
temptations of injustice were removed by the Cornelian law, which
compelled the praetor of the year to adhere to the spirit and letter of
his first proclamation. ^34 It was reserved for the curiosity and
learning of Adrian, to accomplish the design which had been conceived by
the genius of Caesar; and the praetorship of Salvius Julian, an eminent
lawyer, was immortalized by the composition of the Perpetual Edict. This
well-digested code was ratified by the emperor and the senate; the long
divorce of law and equity was at length reconciled; and, instead of the
Twelve Tables, the perpetual edict was fixed as the invariable standard
of civil jurisprudence. ^35</p></li>

progress and growth of the Roman jurisprudence, the necessary operation

<li><p>and, in the decrees of the senate, the epistles and orations of
the prince were respectfully inserted. Adrian ^36 appears to have been
the first who assumed, without disguise, the plenitude of legislative
power. And this innovation, so agreeable to his active mind, was
countenanced by the patience of the times, and his long absence from the
seat of government. The same policy was embraced by succeeding monarchs,
and, according to the harsh metaphor of Tertullian, “the gloomy and
intricate forest of ancient laws was cleared away by the axe of royal
mandates and constitutions.“ ^37 During four centuries, from Adrian to
Justinian the public and private jurisprudence was moulded by the will
of the sovereign; and few institutions, either human or divine, were
permitted to stand on their former basis. The origin of Imperial
legislation was concealed by the darkness of ages and the terrors of
armed despotism; and a double tiction was propagated by the servility,
or perhaps the ignorance, of the civilians, who basked in the sunshine
of the Roman and Byzantine courts. 1. To the prayer of the ancient
Caesars, the people or the senate had sometimes granted a personal
exemption from the obligation and penalty of particular statutes; and
each indulgence was an act of jurisdiction exercised by the republic
over the first of her citizens. His humble privilege was at length
transformed into the prerogative of a tyrant; and the Latin expression
of “released from the laws“ ^38 was supposed to exalt the emperor above
all human restraints, and to leave his conscience and reason as the
sacred measure of his conduct. 2. A similar dependence was implied in
the decrees of the senate, which, in every reign, defined the titles and
powers of an elective magistrate. But it was not before the ideas, and
even the language, of the Romans had been corrupted, that a royal law,
^39 and an irrevocable gift of the people, were created by the fancy of
Ulpian, or more probably of Tribonian himself; ^40 and the origin of
Imperial power, though false in fact, and slavish in its consequence,
was supported on a principle of freedom and justice. “The pleasure of
the emperor has the vigor and effect of law, since the Roman people, by
the royal law, have transferred to their prince the full extent of their
own power and sovereignty.“ ^41 The will of a single man, of a child
perhaps, was allowed to prevail over the wisdom of ages and the
inclinations of millions; and the degenerate Greeks were proud to
declare, that in his hands alone the arbitrary exercise of legislation
could be safely deposited. “What interest or passion,“ exclaims
Theophilus in the court of Justinian, “can reach the calm and sublime
elevation of the monarch? He is already master of the lives and fortunes
of his subjects; and those who have incurred his displeasure are already
numbered with the dead.“ ^42 Disdaining the language of flattery, the
historian may confess, that in questions of private jurisprudence, the
absolute sovereign of a great empire can seldom be influenced by any
personal considerations. Virtue, or even reason, will suggest to his
impartial mind, that he is the guardian of peace and equity, and that
the interest of society is inseparably connected with his own. Under the
weakest and most vicious reign, the seat of justice was filled by the
wisdom and integrity of Papinian and Ulpian; ^43 and the purest
materials of the Code and Pandects are inscribed with the names of
Caracalla and his ministers. ^44 The tyrant of Rome was sometimes the
benefactor of the provinces. A dagger terminated the crimes of Domitian;
but the prudence of Nerva confirmed his acts, which, in the joy of their
deliverance, had been rescinded by an indignant senate. ^45 Yet in the
rescripts, ^46 replies to the consultations of the magistrates, the
wisest of princes might be deceived by a partial exposition of the case.
And this abuse, which placed their hasty decisions on the same level
with mature and deliberate acts of legislation, was ineffectually
condemned by the sense and example of Trajan. The rescripts of the
emperor, his grants and decrees, his edicts and pragmatic sanctions,
were subscribed in purple ink, ^47 and transmitted to the provinces as
general or special laws, which the magistrates were bound to execute,
and the people to obey. But as their number continually multiplied, the
rule of obedience became each day more doubtful and obscure, till the
will of the sovereign was fixed and ascertained in the Gregorian, the
Hermogenian, and the Theodosian codes. ^</p></li>
<li><p>: It is an important question in what manner the emperors were
invested with this legislative power. The newly discovered Gaius
distinctly states that it was in virtue of a law - Nec unquam dubitatum
est, quin id legis vicem obtineat, cum ipse imperator per legem imperium
accipiat. But it is still uncertain whether this was a general law,
passed on the transition of the government from a republican to a
monarchical form, or a law passed on the accession of each emperor.

<li><p>was the first civilian who established his art on a certain and
general theory. ^54 For the discernment of truth and falsehood he
applied, as an infallible rule, the logic of Aristotle and the stoics,
reduced particular cases to general principles, and diffused over the
shapeless mass the light of order and eloquence. Cicero, his
contemporary and friend, declined the reputation of a professed lawyer;
but the jurisprudence of his country was adorned by his incomparable
genius, which converts into gold every object that it touches. After the
example of Plato, he composed a republic; and, for the use of his
republic, a treatise of laws; in which he labors to deduce from a
celestial origin the wisdom and justice of the Roman constitution. The
whole universe, according to his sublime hypothesis, forms one immense
commonwealth: gods and men, who participate of the same essence, are
members of the same community; reason prescribes the law of nature and
nations; and all positive institutions, however modified by accident or
custom, are drawn from the rule of right, which the Deity has inscribed
on every virtuous mind. From these philosophical mysteries, he mildly
excludes the sceptics who refuse to believe, and the epicureans who are
unwilling to act. The latter disdain the care of the republic: he
advises them to slumber in their shady gardens. But he humbly entreats
that the new academy would be silent, since her bold objections would
too soon destroy the fair and well ordered structure of his lofty
system. ^55 Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno, he represents as the only
teachers who arm and instruct a citizen for the duties of social life.
Of these, the armor of the stoics ^56 was found to be of the firmest
temper; and it was chiefly worn, both for use and ornament, in the
schools of jurisprudence. From the portico, the Roman civilians learned
to live, to reason, and to die: but they imbibed in some degree the
prejudices of the sect; the love of paradox, the pertinacious habits of
dispute, and a minute attachment to words and verbal distinctions. The
superiority of form to matter was introduced to ascertain the right of
property: and the equality of crimes is countenanced by an opinion of
Trebatius, ^57 that he who touches the ear, touches the whole body; and
that he who steals from a heap of corn, or a hogshead of wine, is guilty
of the entire theft. ^58</p></li>

<li><p>: The author here follows the then generally received opinion of
Heineccius. The proofs which appear to confirm it are l. 2, # 47, D. I.
2, and # 8. Instit. I. 2. The first of these passages speaks expressly
of a privilege granted to certain lawyers, until the time of Adrian,
publice respondendi jus ante Augusti tempora non dabatur. Primus Divus
Augustus, ut major juris auctoritas haberetur, constituit, ut ex
auctoritate ejus responderent. The passage of the Institutes speaks of
the different opinions of those, quibus est permissum jura condere. It
is true that the first of these passages does not say that the opinion
of these privileged lawyers had the force of a law for the judges. For
this reason M. Hugo altogether rejects the opinion adopted by
Heineccius, by Bach, and in general by all the writers who preceded him.
He conceives that the # 8 of the Institutes referred to the constitution
of Valentinian III., which regulated the respective authority to be
ascribed to the different writings of the great civilians. But we have
now the following passage in the Institutes of Gaius: Responsa prudentum
sunt sententiae et opiniones eorum, quibus permissum est jura condere;
quorum omnium si in unum sententiae concorrupt, id quod ita sentiunt,
legis vicem obtinet, si vero dissentiunt, judici licet, quam velit
sententiam sequi, idque rescripto Divi Hadrian signiticatur. I do not
know, how in opposition to this passage, the opinion of M. Hugo can be
maintained. We must add to this the passage quoted from Pomponius and
from such strong proofs, it seems incontestable that the emperors had
granted some kind of privilege to certain civilians, quibus permissum
erat jura condere. Their opinion had sometimes the force of law, legis
vicem. M. Hugo, endeavoring to reconcile this phrase with his system,
gives it a forced interpretation, which quite alters the sense; he
supposes that the passage contains no more than what is evident of
itself, that the authority of the civilians was to be respected, thus
making a privilege of that which was free to all the world. It appears
to me almost indisputable, that the emperors had sanctioned certain
provisions relative to the authority of these civilians, consulted by
the judges. But how far was their advice to be respected? This is a
question which it is impossible to answer precisely, from the want of
historic evidence. Is it not possible that the emperors established an
authority to be consulted by the judges? and in this case this authority
must have emanated from certain civilians named for this purpose by the
emperors. See Hugo, l. c. Moreover, may not the passage of Suetonius, in
the Life of Caligula, where he says that the emperor would no longer
permit the civilians to give their advice, mean that Caligula
entertained the design of suppressing this institution? See on this
passage the Themis, vol. xi. p. 17, 36. Our author not being acquainted
with the opinions opposed to Heineccius has not gone to the bottom of
the subject. - W.]</p></li>

Cicero and the last of the Antonines, many losses had been already
sustained, and some luminaries of the school, or forum, were known only
to the curious by tradition and report. Three hundred and sixty years of
disorder and decay accelerated the progress of oblivion; and it may
fairly be presumed, that of the writings, which Justinian is accused of
neglecting, many were no longer to be found in the libraries of the
East. ^85 The copies of Papinian, or Ulpian, which the reformer had
proscribed, were deemed unworthy of future notice: the Twelve Tables and
praetorian edicts insensibly vanished, and the monuments of ancient Rome
were neglected or destroyed by the envy and ignorance of the Greeks.
Even the Pandects themselves have escaped with difficulty and danger
from the common shipwreck, and criticism has pronounced that all the
editions and manuscripts of the West are derived from one original. ^86

<li><p>The warmest applause has been lavished on the virtue of the
Romans, who abstained from the exercise of this tempting privilege above
five hundred years: ^124 but the same fact evinces the unequal terms of
a connection in which the slave was unable to renounce her tyrant, and
the tyrant was unwilling to relinquish his slave. When the Roman matrons
became the equal and voluntary companions of their lords, a new
jurisprudence was introduced, that marriage, like other partnerships,
might be dissolved by the abdication of one of the associates. In three
centuries of prosperity and corruption, this principle was enlarged to
frequent practice and pernicious abuse.</p></li>

of blood. According to the proud maxims of the republic, a legal
marriage could only be contracted by free citizens; an honorable, at
least an ingenuous birth, was required for the spouse of a senator: but
the blood of kings could never mingle in legitimate nuptials with the
blood of a Roman; and the name of Stranger degraded Cleopatra and
Berenice, ^133 to live the concubines of Mark Antony and Titus. ^134
This appellation, indeed, so injurious to the majesty, cannot without
indulgence be applied to the manners, of these Oriental queens. A
concubine, in the strict sense of the civilians, was a woman of servile
or plebeian extraction, the sole and faithful companion of a Roman
citizen, who continued in a state of celibacy. Her modest station, below
the honors of a wife, above the infamy of a prostitute, was acknowledged
and approved by the laws: from the age of Augustus to the tenth century,
the use of this secondary marriage prevailed both in the West and East;
and the humble virtues of a concubine were often preferred to the pomp
and insolence of a noble matron. In this connection, the two Antonines,
the best of princes and of men, enjoyed the comforts of domestic love:
the example was imitated by many citizens impatient of celibacy, but
regardful of their families. If at any time they desired to legitimate
their natural children, the conversion was instantly performed by the
celebration of their nuptials with a partner whose faithfulness and
fidelity they had already tried. ^</p></li>
<li><p>: According to the earlier law, (Gaii Instit. p. 27,) a man might
marry his niece on the brother’s, not on the sister’s, side. The emperor
Claudius set the example of the former. In the Institutes, this
distinction was abolished and both declared illegal. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>: The Edict of Constantine first conferred this right; for
Augustus had prohibited the taking as a concubine a woman who might be
taken as a wife; and if marriage took place afterwards, this marriage
made no change in the rights of the children born before it; recourse
was then had to adoption, properly called arrogation. - G.]</p></li>

the body, a curator was interposed to guard the fortunes of a Roman
youth from his own inexperience and headstrong passions. Such a trustee
had been first instituted by the praetor, to save a family from the
blind havoc of a prodigal or madman; and the minor was compelled, by the
laws, to solicit the same protection, to give validity to his acts till
he accomplished the full period of twenty-five years. Women were
condemned to the perpetual tutelage of parents, husbands, or guardians;
a sex created to please and obey was never supposed to have attained the

spirit of the ancient law, which had been insensibly mollified before
the time of Justinian.</p></li>

puberty at twelve or fourteen years.“ It was not so; before Justinian,

daily food; he might be bound with a chain of fifteen pounds weight; and
his misery was thrice exposed in the market place, to solicit the
compassion of his friends and countrymen. At the expiration of sixty
days, the debt was discharged by the loss of liberty or life; the
insolvent debtor was either put to death, or sold in foreign slavery
beyond the Tyber: but, if several creditors were alike obstinate and
unrelenting, they might legally dismember his body, and satiate their
revenge by this horrid partition. The advocates for this savage law have
insisted, that it must strongly operate in deterring idleness and fraud
from contracting debts which they were unable to discharge; but
experience would dissipate this salutary terror, by proving that no
creditor could be found to exact this unprofitable penalty of life or
limb. As the manners of Rome were insensibly polished, the criminal code
of the decemvirs was abolished by the humanity of accusers, witnesses,
and judges; and impunity became the consequence of immoderate rigor. The
Porcian and Valerian laws prohibited the magistrates from inflicting on
a free citizen any capital, or even corporal, punishment; and the
obsolete statutes of blood were artfully, and perhaps truly, ascribed to
the spirit, not of patrician, but of regal, tyranny.</p></li>

<li><p>they secretly invoked the protector of the Christians, and, after
the pious murder of their satraps, the rebels were avowed and supported
as the brethren and subjects of the Roman emperor. The complaints of
Nushirvan were disregarded by the Byzantine court; Justin yielded to the
importunities of the Turks, who offered an alliance against the common
enemy; and the Persian monarchy was threatened at the same instant by
the united forces of Europe, of Aethiopia, and of Scythia. At the age of
fourscore the sovereign of the East would perhaps have chosen the
peaceful enjoyment of his glory and greatness; but as soon as war became
inevitable, he took the field with the alacrity of youth, whilst the
aggressor trembled in the palace of Constantinople. Nushirvan, or
Chosroes, conducted in person the siege of Dara; and although that
important fortress had been left destitute of troops and magazines, the
valor of the inhabitants resisted above five months the archers, the
elephants, and the military engines of the Great King. In the mean while
his general Adarman advanced from Babylon, traversed the desert, passed
the Euphrates, insulted the suburbs of Antioch, reduced to ashes the
city of Apamea, and laid the spoils of Syria at the feet of his master,
whose perseverance in the midst of winter at length subverted the
bulwark of the East. But these losses, which astonished the provinces
and the court, produced a salutary effect in the repentance and
abdication of the emperor Justin: a new spirit arose in the Byzantine
councils; and a truce of three years was obtained by the prudence of
Tiberius. That seasonable interval was employed in the preparations of
war; and the voice of rumor proclaimed to the world, that from the
distant countries of the Alps and the Rhine, from Scythia, Maesia,
Pannonia, Illyricum, and Isauria, the strength of the Imperial cavalry
was reenforced with one hundred and fifty thousand soldiers. Yet the
king of Persia, without fear, or without faith, resolved to prevent the
attack of the enemy; again passed the Euphrates, and dismissing the
ambassadors of Tiberius, arrogantly commanded them to await his arrival
at Caesarea, the metropolis of the Cappadocian provinces. The two armies
encountered each other in the battle of Melitene: ^</p></li>

<li><p>: Persarmenia was long maintained in peace by the tolerant
administration of Mejej, prince of the Gnounians. On his death he was
succeeded by a persecutor, a Persian, named Ten-Schahpour, who attempted
to propagate Zoroastrianism by violence. Nushirvan, on an appeal to the
throne by the Armenian clergy, replaced Ten-Schahpour, in 552, by
Veschnas-Vahram. The new marzban, or governor, was instructed to repress
the bigoted Magi in their persecutions of the Armenians, but the Persian
converts to Christianity were still exposed to cruel sufferings. The
most distinguished of them, Izdbouzid, was crucified at Dovin in the
presence of a vast multitude. The fame of this martyr spread to the
West. Menander, the historian, not only, as appears by a fragment
published by Mai, related this event in his history, but, according to
M. St. Martin, wrote a tragedy on the subject. This, however, is an
unwarrantable inference from the phrase which merely means that he
related the tragic event in his history. An epigram on the same subject,
preserved in the Anthology, Jacob’s Anth. Palat. i. 27, belongs to the
historian. Yet Armenia remained in peace under the government of
Veschnas-Vahram and his successor Varazdat. The tyranny of his successor
Surena led to the insurrection under Vartan, the Mamigonian, who
revenged the death of his brother on the marzban Surena, surprised
Dovin, and put to the sword the governor, the soldiers, and the Magians.

<li><p>is expressive of the quality of dry wood: he had the strength and
stature of a giant; and his savage countenance was fancifully compared
to that of a wild cat. While the nation trembled, while Hormouz
disguised his terror by the name of suspicion, and his servants
concealed their disloyalty under the mask of fear, Bahram alone
displayed his undaunted courage and apparent fidelity: and as soon as he
found that no more than twelve thousand soldiers would follow him
against the enemy; he prudently declared, that to this fatal number
Heaven had reserved the honors of the triumph. ^! The steep and narrow
descent of the Pule Rudbar, ^12 or Hyrcanian rock, is the only pass
through which an army can penetrate into the territory of Rei and the
plains of Media. From the commanding heights, a band of resolute men
might overwhelm with stones and darts the myriads of the Turkish host:
their emperor and his son were transpierced with arrows; and the
fugitives were left, without counsel or provisions, to the revenge of an
injured people. The patriotism of the Persian general was stimulated by
his affection for the city of his forefathers: in the hour of victory,
every peasant became a soldier, and every soldier a hero; and their
ardor was kindled by the gorgeous spectacle of beds, and thrones, and
tables of massy gold, the spoils of Asia, and the luxury of the hostile
camp. A prince of a less malignant temper could not easily have forgiven
his benefactor; and the secret hatred of Hormouz was envenomed by a
malicious report, that Bahram had privately retained the most precious
fruits of his Turkish victory. But the approach of a Roman army on the
side of the Araxes compelled the implacable tyrant to smile and to
applaud; and the toils of Bahram were rewarded with the permission of
encountering a new enemy, by their skill and discipline more formidable
than a Scythian multitude. Elated by his recent success, he despatched a
herald with a bold defiance to the camp of the Romans, requesting them
to fix a day of battle, and to choose whether they would pass the river
themselves, or allow a free passage to the arms of the great king. The
lieutenant of the emperor Maurice preferred the safer alternative; and
this local circumstance, which would have enhanced the victory of the
Persians, rendered their defeat more bloody and their escape more
difficult. But the loss of his subjects, and the danger of his kingdom,
were overbalanced in the mind of Hormouz by the disgrace of his personal
enemy; and no sooner had Bahram collected and reviewed his forces, than
he received from a royal messenger the insulting gift of a distaff, a
spinning-wheel, and a complete suit of female apparel. Obedient to the
will of his sovereign he showed himself to the soldiers in this unworthy
disguise they resented his ignominy and their own; a shout of rebellion
ran through the ranks; and the general accepted their oath of fidelity
and vows of revenge. A second messenger, who had been commanded to bring
the rebel in chains, was trampled under the feet of an elephant, and
manifestos were diligently circulated, exhorting the Persians to assert
their freedom against an odious and contemptible tyrant. The defection
was rapid and universal; his loyal slaves were sacrificed to the public
fury; the troops deserted to the standard of Bahram; and the provinces
again saluted the deliverer of his country.</p></li>

<li><p>The enterprise, however splendid, was less arduous than it might
appear. Persia had already repented of her fatal rashness, which
betrayed the heir of the house of Sassan to the ambition of a rebellious
subject: and the bold refusal of the Magi to consecrate his usurpation,
compelled Bahram to assume the sceptre, regardless of the laws and
prejudices of the nation. The palace was soon distracted with
conspiracy, the city with tumult, the provinces with insurrection; and
the cruel execution of the guilty and the suspected served to irritate
rather than subdue the public discontent. No sooner did the grandson of
Nushirvan display his own and the Roman banners beyond the Tigris, than
he was joined, each day, by the increasing multitudes of the nobility
and people; and as he advanced, he received from every side the grateful
offerings of the keys of his cities and the heads of his enemies. As
soon as Modain was freed from the presence of the usurper, the loyal
inhabitants obeyed the first summons of Mebodes at the head of only two
thousand horse, and Chosroes accepted the sacred and precious ornaments
of the palace as the pledge of their truth and the presage of his
approaching success. After the junction of the Imperial troops, which
Bahram vainly struggled to prevent, the contest was decided by two
battles on the banks of the Zab, and the confines of Media. The Romans,
with the faithful subjects of Persia, amounted to sixty thousand, while
the whole force of the usurper did not exceed forty thousand men: the
two generals signalized their valor and ability; but the victory was
finally determined by the prevalence of numbers and discipline. With the
remnant of a broken army, Bahram fled towards the eastern provinces of
the Oxus: the enmity of Persia reconciled him to the Turks; but his days
were shortened by poison, perhaps the most incurable of poisons; the
stings of remorse and despair, and the bitter remembrance of lost glory.
Yet the modern Persians still commemorate the exploits of Bahram; and
some excellent laws have prolonged the duration of his troubled and
transitory reign. ^</p></li>

<li><p>were restored, and the Persarmenians became the willing subjects
of an empire, whose eastern limit was extended, beyond the example of
former times, as far as the banks of the Araxes, and the neighborhood of
the Caspian. A pious hope was indulged, that the church as well as the
state might triumph in this revolution: but if Chosroes had sincerely
listened to the Christian bishops, the impression was erased by the zeal
and eloquence of the Magi: if he was armed with philosophic
indifference, he accommodated his belief, or rather his professions, to
the various circumstances of an exile and a sovereign. The imaginary
conversion of the king of Persia was reduced to a local and
superstitious veneration for Sergius, ^19 one of the saints of Antioch,
who heard his prayers and appeared to him in dreams; he enriched the
shrine with offerings of gold and silver, and ascribed to this invisible
patron the success of his arms, and the pregnancy of Sira, a devout
Christian and the best beloved of his wives. ^20 The beauty of Sira, or
Schirin, ^21 her wit, her musical talents, are still famous in the
history, or rather in the romances, of the East: her own name is
expressive, in the Persian tongue, of sweetness and grace; and the
epithet of Parviz alludes to the charms of her royal lover. Yet Sira
never shared the passions which she inspired, and the bliss of Chosroes
was tortured by a jealous doubt, that while he possessed her person, she
had bestowed her affections on a meaner favorite. ^22</p></li>

Christians is imputed to the Jews and Arabs, who swelled the disorder of

among a crowd of saints by the epithet of almsgiver: ^61 and the
revenues of the church, with a treasure of three hundred thousand
pounds, were restored to the true proprietors, the poor of every country
and every denomination. But Egypt itself, the only province which had
been exempt, since the time of Diocletian, from foreign and domestic
war, was again subdued by the successors of Cyrus. Pelusium, the key of
that impervious country, was surprised by the cavalry of the Persians:
they passed, with impunity, the innumerable channels of the Delta, and
explored the long valley of the Nile, from the pyramids of Memphis to
the confines of Aethiopia. Alexandria might have been relieved by a
naval force, but the archbishop and the praefect embarked for Cyprus;
and Chosroes entered the second city of the empire, which still
preserved a wealthy remnant of industry and commerce. His western trophy
was erected, not on the walls of Carthage, ^62 but in the neighborhood
of Tripoli; the Greek colonies of Cyrene were finally extirpated; and
the conqueror, treading in the footsteps of Alexander, returned in
triumph through the sands of the Libyan desert. In the same campaign,
another army advanced from the Euphrates to the Thracian Bosphorus;
Chalcedon surrendered after a long siege, and a Persian camp was
maintained above ten years in the presence of Constantinople. The
sea-coast of Pontus, the city of Ancyra, and the Isle of Rhodes, are
enumerated among the last conquests of the great king; and if Chosroes

hopes, and even to have satiated their avarice. Whatever could not be
easily transported, they consumed with fire, that Chosroes might feel
the anguish of those wounds which he had so often inflicted on the
provinces of the empire: and justice might allow the excuse, if the
desolation had been confined to the works of regal luxury, if national
hatred, military license, and religious zeal, had not wasted with equal
rage the habitations and the temples of the guiltless subject. The
recovery of three hundred Roman standards, and the deliverance of the
numerous captives of Edessa and Alexandria, reflect a purer glory on the
arms of Heraclius. From the palace of Dastagerd, he pursued his march
within a few miles of Modain or Ctesiphon, till he was stopped, on the
banks of the Arba, by the difficulty of the passage, the rigor of the
season, and perhaps the fame of an impregnable capital. The return of
the emperor is marked by the modern name of the city of Sherhzour: he
fortunately passed Mount Zara, before the snow, which fell incessantly

to entertain the soldiers and their horses with a hospitable reception.

in which he showed himself to the prostrate crowd, was changed to a
rapid and secret journey; and the first evening he lodged in the cottage
of a peasant, whose humble door would scarcely give admittance to the
great king. ^105 His superstition was subdued by fear: on the third day,
he entered with joy the fortifications of Ctesiphon; yet he still
doubted of his safety till he had opposed the River Tigris to the
pursuit of the Romans. The discovery of his flight agitated with terror
and tumult the palace, the city, and the camp of Dastagerd: the satraps
hesitated whether they had most to fear from their sovereign or the
enemy; and the females of the harem were astonished and pleased by the
sight of mankind, till the jealous husband of three thousand wives again
confined them to a more distant castle. At his command, the army of
Dastagerd retreated to a new camp: the front was covered by the Arba,
and a line of two hundred elephants; the troops of the more distant
provinces successively arrived, and the vilest domestics of the king and
satraps were enrolled for the last defence of the throne. It was still
in the power of Chosroes to obtain a reasonable peace; and he was
repeatedly pressed by the messengers of Heraclius to spare the blood of
his subjects, and to relieve a humane conqueror from the painful duty of
carrying fire and sword through the fairest countries of Asia. But the
pride of the Persian had not yet sunk to the level of his fortune; he
derived a momentary confidence from the retreat of the emperor; he wept
with impotent rage over the ruins of his Assyrian palaces, and
disregarded too long the rising murmurs of the nation, who complained
that their lives and fortunes were sacrificed to the obstinacy of an old
man. That unhappy old man was himself tortured with the sharpest pains
both of mind and body; and, in the consciousness of his approaching end,
he resolved to fix the tiara on the head of Merdaza, the most favored of
his sons. But the will of Chosroes was no longer revered, and Siroes,

<li><p>before his face, and he was thrown into a dungeon, where he
expired on the fifth day. The Greeks and modern Persians minutely
describe how Chosroes was insulted, and famished, and tortured, by the
command of an inhuman son, who so far surpassed the example of his
father: but at the time of his death, what tongue would relate the story
of the parricide? what eye could penetrate into the tower of darkness?
According to the faith and mercy of his Christian enemies, he sunk
without hope into a still deeper abyss; ^107 and it will not be denied,
that tyrants of every age and sect are the best entitled to such
infernal abodes. The glory of the house of Sassan ended with the life of
Chosroes: his unnatural son enjoyed only eight months the fruit of his
crimes: and in the space of four years, the regal title was assumed by
nine candidates, who disputed, with the sword or dagger, the fragments
of an exhausted monarchy. Every province, and each city of Persia, was
the scene of independence, of discord, and of blood; and the state of
anarchy prevailed about eight years longer, ^!! till the factions were
silenced and united under the common yoke of the Arabian caliphs.

and Hercules, ^112 was eclipsed in the popular estimation, by the
superior merit and glory of the great Heraclius. Yet the deliverer of
the East was indigent and feeble. Of the Persian spoils, the most
valuable portion had been expended in the war, distributed to the
soldiers, or buried, by an unlucky tempest, in the waves of the Euxine.
The conscience of the emperor was oppressed by the obligation of
restoring the wealth of the clergy, which he had borrowed for their own
defence: a perpetual fund was required to satisfy these inexorable
creditors; the provinces, already wasted by the arms and avarice of the
Persians, were compelled to a second payment of the same taxes; and the
arrears of a simple citizen, the treasurer of Damascus, were commuted to
a fine of one hundred thousand pieces of gold. The loss of two hundred
thousand soldiers ^113 who had fallen by the sword, was of less fatal
importance than the decay of arts, agriculture, and population, in this
long and destructive war: and although a victorious army had been formed
under the standard of Heraclius, the unnatural effort appears to have
exhausted rather than exercised their strength. While the emperor
triumphed at Constantinople or Jerusalem, an obscure town on the
confines of Syria was pillaged by the Saracens, and they cut in pieces
some troops who advanced to its relief; an ordinary and trifling
occurrence, had it not been the prelude of a mighty revolution. These
robbers were the apostles of Mahomet; their fanatic valor had emerged
from the desert; and in the last eight years of his reign, Heraclius
lost to the Arabs the same provinces which he had rescued from the
Persians.</p></li>
<li><p>: If the clergy imposed upon the kneeling and penitent emperor
the persecution of the Jews, it must be acknowledge that provocation was
not wanting; for how many of them had been eye-witnesses of, perhaps
sufferers in, the horrible atrocities committed on the capture of the
city! Yet we have no authentic account of great severities exercised by
Heraclius. The law of Hadrian was reenacted, which prohibited the Jews
from approaching within three miles of the city - a law, which, in the
present exasperated state of the Christians, might be a measure of
security of mercy, rather than of oppression. Milman, Hist. of the Jews,

<li><p>The disorders of their country, and their ignorance of the Greek
tongue, prevented their clergy from assisting at the synod of Chalcedon,
and they floated eighty-four years ^140 in a state of indifference or
suspense, till their vacant faith was finally occupied by the
missionaries of Julian of Halicarnassus, ^141 who in Egypt, their common
exile, had been vanquished by the arguments or the influence of his
rival Severus, the Monophysite patriarch of Antioch. The Armenians alone
are the pure disciples of Eutyches, an unfortunate parent, who has been
renounced by the greater part of his spiritual progeny. They alone
persevere in the opinion, that the manhood of Christ was created, or
existed without creation, of a divine and incorruptible substance. Their
adversaries reproach them with the adoration of a phantom; and they
retort the accusation, by deriding or execrating the blasphemy of the
Jacobites, who impute to the Godhead the vile infirmities of the flesh,
even the natural effects of nutrition and digestion. The religion of
Armenia could not derive much glory from the learning or the power of
its inhabitants. The royalty expired with the origin of their schism;
and their Christian kings, who arose and fell in the thirteenth century
on the confines of Cilicia, were the clients of the Latins and the
vassals of the Turkish sultan of Iconium. The helpless nation has seldom
been permitted to enjoy the tranquillity of servitude. From the earliest
period to the present hour, Armenia has been the theatre of perpetual
war: the lands between Tauris and Erivan were dispeopled by the cruel
policy of the Sophis; and myriads of Christian families were
transplanted, to perish or to propagate in the distant provinces of
Persia. Under the rod of oppression, the zeal of the Armenians is
fervent and intrepid; they have often preferred the crown of martyrdom
to the white turban of Mahomet; they devoutly hate the error and
idolatry of the Greeks; and their transient union with the Latins is not
less devoid of truth, than the thousand bishops, whom their patriarch
offered at the feet of the Roman pontiff. ^142 The catholic, or
patriarch, of the Armenians resides in the monastery of Ekmiasin, three
leagues from Erivan. Forty-seven archbishops, each of whom may claim the
obedience of four or five suffragans, are consecrated by his hand; but
the far greater part are only titular prelates, who dignify with their
presence and service the simplicity of his court. As soon as they have
performed the liturgy, they cultivate the garden; and our bishops will
hear with surprise, that the austerity of their life increases in just
proportion to the elevation of their rank.</p></li>

<li><p>and Terbelis retired, after sweeping away a heap of gold coin,
which he measured with his Scythian whip. But never was vow more
religiously performed than the sacred oath of revenge which he had sworn
amidst the storms of the Euxine. The two usurpers (for I must reserve
the name of tyrant for the conqueror) were dragged into the hippodrome,
the one from his prison, the other from his palace. Before their
execution, Leontius and Apsimar were cast prostrate in chains beneath
the throne of the emperor; and Justinian, planting a foot on each of
their necks, contemplated above an hour the chariot-race, while the
inconstant people shouted, in the words of the Psalmist, “Thou shalt
trample on the asp and basilisk, and on the lion and dragon shalt thou
set thy foot!“ The universal defection which he had once experienced
might provoke him to repeat the wish of Caligula, that the Roman people
had but one head. Yet I shall presume to observe, that such a wish is
unworthy of an ingenious tyrant, since his revenge and cruelty would
have been extinguished by a single blow, instead of the slow variety of
tortures which Justinian inflicted on the victims of his anger. His
pleasures were inexhaustible: neither private virtue nor public service
could expiate the guilt of active, or even passive, obedience to an
established government; and, during the six years of his new reign, he
considered the axe, the cord, and the rack, as the only instruments of
royalty. But his most implacable hatred was pointed against the
Chersonites, who had insulted his exile and violated the laws of
hospitality. Their remote situation afforded some means of defence, or
at least of escape; and a grievous tax was imposed on Constantinople, to
supply the preparations of a fleet and army. “All are guilty, and all
must perish,“ was the mandate of Justinian; and the bloody execution was
intrusted to his favorite Stephen, who was recommended by the epithet of
the savage. Yet even the savage Stephen imperfectly accomplished the
intentions of his sovereign. The slowness of his attack allowed the
greater part of the inhabitants to withdraw into the country; and the
minister of vengeance contented himself with reducing the youth of both
sexes to a state of servitude, with roasting alive seven of the
principal citizens, with drowning twenty in the sea, and with reserving
forty-two in chains to receive their doom from the mouth of the emperor.
In their return, the fleet was driven on the rocky shores of Anatolia;
and Justinian applauded the obedience of the Euxine, which had involved
so many thousands of his subjects and enemies in a common shipwreck: but
the tyrant was still insatiate of blood; and a second expedition was
commanded to extirpate the remains of the proscribed colony. In the
short interval, the Chersonites had returned to their city, and were
prepared to die in arms; the khan of the Chozars had renounced the cause
of his odious brother; the exiles of every province were assembled in
Tauris; and Bardanes, under the name of Philippicus, was invested with
the purple. The Imperial troops, unwilling and unable to perpetrate the
revenge of Justinian, escaped his displeasure by abjuring his
allegiance: the fleet, under their new sovereign, steered back a more
auspicious course to the harbors of Sinope and Constantinople; and every
tongue was prompt to pronounce, every hand to execute, the death of the
tyrant. Destitute of friends, he was deserted by his Barbarian guards;
and the stroke of the assassin was praised as an act of patriotism and
Roman virtue. His son Tiberius had taken refuge in a church; his aged
grandmother guarded the door; and the innocent youth, suspending round
his neck the most formidable relics, embraced with one hand the altar,
with the other the wood of the true cross. But the popular fury that
dares to trample on superstition, is deaf to the cries of humanity; and
the race of Heraclius was extinguished after a reign of one hundred
years</p></li>

<li><p>The Catholics hated the person and government of Copronymus; but
even their hatred is a proof of their oppression. They dissembled the
provocations which might excuse or justify his rigor, but even these
provocations must gradually inflame his resentment and harden his temper
in the use or the abuse of despotism. Yet the character of the fifth
Constantine was not devoid of merit, nor did his government always
deserve the curses or the contempt of the Greeks. From the confession of
his enemies, I am informed of the restoration of an ancient aqueduct, of
the redemption of two thousand five hundred captives, of the uncommon
plenty of the times, and of the new colonies with which he repeopled
Constantinople and the Thracian cities. They reluctantly praise his
activity and courage; he was on horseback in the field at the head of
his legions; and, although the fortune of his arms was various, he
triumphed by sea and land, on the Euphrates and the Danube, in civil and
Barbarian war. Heretical praise must be cast into the scale to
counterbalance the weight of orthodox invective. The Iconoclasts revered
the virtues of the prince: forty years after his death they still prayed
before the tomb of the saint. A miraculous vision was propagated by
fanaticism or fraud: and the Christian hero appeared on a milk-white
steed, brandishing his lance against the Pagans of Bulgaria: “An absurd
fable,“ says the Catholic historian, “since Copronymus is chained with
the daemons in the abyss of hell.“</p></li>

before the professors. Bilder sturmand Kaiser, p. 294. Compare Le Heau.

<li><p>and body, and the principal care of his reign was the settlement
of the succession. The association of the young Constantine was urged by
the officious zeal of his subjects; and the emperor, conscious of his
decay, complied, after a prudent hesitation, with their unanimous
wishes. The royal infant, at the age of five years, was crowned with his
mother Irene; and the national consent was ratified by every
circumstance of pomp and solemnity, that could dazzle the eyes or bind
the conscience of the Greeks. An oath of fidelity was administered in
the palace, the church, and the hippodrome, to the several orders of the
state, who adjured the holy names of the Son, and mother of God. “Be
witness, O Christ! that we will watch over the safety of Constantine the
son of Leo, expose our lives in his service, and bear true allegiance to
his person and posterity.“ They pledged their faith on the wood of the
true cross, and the act of their engagement was deposited on the altar
of St. Sophia. The first to swear, and the first to violate their oath,
were the five sons of Copronymus by a second marriage; and the story of
these princes is singular and tragic. The right of primogeniture
excluded them from the throne; the injustice of their elder brother
defrauded them of a legacy of about two millions sterling; some vain
titles were not deemed a sufficient compensation for wealth and power;
and they repeatedly conspired against their nephew, before and after the
death of his father. Their first attempt was pardoned; for the second
offence ^! they were condemned to the ecclesiastical state; and for the
third treason, Nicephorus, the eldest and most guilty, was deprived of
his eyes, and his four brothers, Christopher, Nicetas, Anthemeus, and
Eudoxas, were punished, as a milder sentence, by the amputation of their
tongues. After five years’ confinement, they escaped to the church of
St. Sophia, and displayed a pathetic spectacle to the people.
“Countrymen and Christians,“ cried Nicephorus for himself and his mute
brethren, “behold the sons of your emperor, if you can still recognize
our features in this miserable state. A life, an imperfect life, is all
that the malice of our enemies has spared. It is now threatened, and we
now throw ourselves on your compassion.“ The rising murmur might have
produced a revolution, had it not been checked by the presence of a
minister, who soothed the unhappy princes with flattery and hope, and
gently drew them from the sanctuary to the palace. They were speedily
embarked for Greece, and Athens was allotted for the place of their
exile. In this calm retreat, and in their helpless condition, Nicephorus
and his brothers were tormented by the thirst of power, and tempted by a
Sclavonian chief, who offered to break their prison, and to lead them in
arms, and in the purple, to the gates of Constantinople. But the
Athenian people, ever zealous in the cause of Irene, prevented her
justice or cruelty; and the five sons of Copronymus were plunged in
eternal darkness and oblivion.</p></li>
<li><p>: Schlosser thinks more highly of Leo’s mind; but his only proof
of his superiority is the successes of his generals against the
Saracens, Schlosser, p. 256. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>Yet the blind son of Irene survived many years, oppressed by the
court and forgotten by the world; the Isaurian dynasty was silently
extinguished; and the memory of Constantine was recalled only by the
nuptials of his daughter Euphrosyne with the emperor Michael the
Second.</p></li>

<li><p>His son and heir Stauracius escaped from the field with a mortal
wound; yet six months of an expiring life were sufficient to refute his
indecent, though popular declaration, that he would in all things avoid
the example of his father. On the near prospect of his decease, Michael,
the great master of the palace, and the husband of his sister Procopia,
was named by every person of the palace and city, except by his envious
brother. Tenacious of a sceptre now falling from his hand, he conspired
against the life of his successor, and cherished the idea of changing to
a democracy the Roman empire. But these rash projects served only to
inflame the zeal of the people and to remove the scruples of the
candidate: Michael the First accepted the purple, and before he sunk
into the grave the son of Nicephorus implored the clemency of his new
sovereign. Had Michael in an age of peace ascended an hereditary throne,
he might have reigned and died the father of his people: but his mild
virtues were adapted to the shade of private life, nor was he capable of
controlling the ambition of his equals, or of resisting the arms of the
victorious Bulgarians. While his want of ability and success exposed him
to the contempt of the soldiers, the masculine spirit of his wife
Procopia awakened their indignation. Even the Greeks of the ninth
century were provoked by the insolence of a female, who, in the front of
the standards, presumed to direct their discipline and animate their
valor; and their licentious clamors advised the new Semiramis to
reverence the majesty of a Roman camp. After an unsuccessful campaign,
the emperor left, in their winter-quarters of Thrace, a disaffected army
under the command of his enemies; and their artful eloquence persuaded
the soldiers to break the dominion of the eunuchs, to degrade the
husband of Procopia, and to assert the right of a military election.
They marched towards the capital: yet the clergy, the senate, and the
people of Constantinople, adhered to the cause of Michael; and the
troops and treasures of Asia might have protracted the mischiefs of
civil war. But his humanity (by the ambitious it will be termed his
weakness) protested that not a drop of Christian blood should be shed in
his quarrel, and his messengers presented the conquerors with the keys
of the city and the palace. They were disarmed by his innocence and
submission; his life and his eyes were spared; and the Imperial monk
enjoyed the comforts of solitude and religion above thirty-two years
after he had been stripped of the purple and separated from his
wife.</p></li>

<li><p>In his midnight revels, when his passions were inflamed by wine,
he was provoked to issue the most sanguinary commands; and if any
feelings of humanity were left, he was reduced, with the return of
sense, to approve the salutary disobedience of his servants. But the
most extraordinary feature in the character of Michael, is the profane
mockery of the religion of his country. The superstition of the Greeks
might indeed excite the smile of a philosopher; but his smile would have
been rational and temperate, and he must have condemned the ignorant
folly of a youth who insulted the objects of public veneration. A
buffoon of the court was invested in the robes of the patriarch: his
twelve metropolitans, among whom the emperor was ranked, assumed their
ecclesiastical garments: they used or abused the sacred vessels of the
altar; and in their bacchanalian feasts, the holy communion was
administered in a nauseous compound of vinegar and mustard. Nor were
these impious spectacles concealed from the eyes of the city. On the day
of a solemn festival, the emperor, with his bishops or buffoons, rode on
asses through the streets, encountered the true patriarch at the head of
his clergy; and by their licentious shouts and obscene gestures,
disordered the gravity of the Christian procession. The devotion of
Michael appeared only in some offence to reason or piety: he received
his theatrical crowns from the statue of the Virgin; and an Imperial
tomb was violated for the sake of burning the bones of Constantine the
Iconoclast. By this extravagant conduct, the son of Theophilus became as
contemptible as he was odious: every citizen was impatient for the
deliverance of his country; and even the favorites of the moment were
apprehensive that a caprice might snatch away what a caprice had
bestowed. In the thirtieth year of his age, and in the hour of
intoxication and sleep, Michael the Third was murdered in his chamber by
the founder of a new dynasty, whom the emperor had raised to an equality
of rank and power.</p></li>

clergy and people. The popularity of the emperor was lost in the purple:
in a reign of six years he provoked the hatred of strangers and
subjects: and the hypocrisy and avarice of the first Nicephorus were
revived in his successor. Hypocrisy I shall never justify or palliate;
but I will dare to observe, that the odious vice of avarice is of all
others most hastily arraigned, and most unmercifully condemned. In a
private citizen, our judgment seldom expects an accurate scrutiny into
his fortune and expense; and in a steward of the public treasure,
frugality is always a virtue, and the increase of taxes too often an
indispensable duty. In the use of his patrimony, the generous temper of
Nicephorus had been proved; and the revenue was strictly applied to the
service of the state: each spring the emperor marched in person against
the Saracens; and every Roman might compute the employment of his taxes
in triumphs, conquests, and the security of the Eastern barrier.

<li><p>The murder was protracted by insult and cruelty: and as soon as
the head of Nicephorus was shown from the window, the tumult was hushed,
and the Armenian was emperor of the East. On the day of his coronation,
he was stopped on the threshold of St. Sophia, by the intrepid
patriarch; who charged his conscience with the deed of treason and
blood; and required, as a sign of repentance, that he should separate
himself from his more criminal associate. This sally of apostolic zeal
was not offensive to the prince, since he could neither love nor trust a
woman who had repeatedly violated the most sacred obligations; and
Theophano, instead of sharing his imperial fortune, was dismissed with
ignominy from his bed and palace. In their last interview, she displayed
a frantic and impotent rage; accused the ingratitude of her lover;
assaulted, with words and blows, her son Basil, as he stood silent and
submissive in the presence of a superior colleague; and avowed her own
prostitution in proclaiming the illegitimacy of his birth. The public
indignation was appeased by her exile, and the punishment of the meaner
accomplices: the death of an unpopular prince was forgiven; and the
guilt of Zimisces was forgotten in the splendor of his virtues. Perhaps
his profusion was less useful to the state than the avarice of
Nicephorus; but his gentle and generous behavior delighted all who
approached his person; and it was only in the paths of victory that he
trod in the footsteps of his predecessor. The greatest part of his reign
was employed in the camp and the field: his personal valor and activity
were signalized on the Danube and the Tigris, the ancient boundaries of
the Roman world; and by his double triumph over the Russians and the
Saracens, he deserved the titles of savior of the empire, and conqueror
of the East. In his last return from Syria, he observed that the most
fruitful lands of his new provinces were possessed by the eunuchs. “And
is it for them,“ he exclaimed, with honest indignation, “that we have
fought and conquered? Is it for them that we shed our blood, and exhaust
the treasures of our people?“ The complaint was reechoed to the palace,
and the death of Zimisces is strongly marked with the suspicion of
poison.</p></li>
<li><p>: According to Leo Diaconus, Zimisces, after ordering the wounded
emperor to be dragged to his feet, and heaping him with insult, to which
the miserable man only replied by invoking the name of the “mother of
God,“ with his own hand plucked his beard, while his accomplices beat
out his teeth with the hilts of their swords, and then trampling him to
the ground, drove his sword into his skull. Leo Diac, in Niebuhr Byz.

<li><p>and twice invested with the purple, was desirous of ending in
peace the small remainder of his days. As the aged suppliant approached
the throne, with dim eyes and faltering steps, leaning on his two
attendants, the emperor exclaimed, in the insolence of youth and power,
“And is this the man who has so long been the object of our terror?“
After he had confirmed his own authority, and the peace of the empire,
the trophies of Nicephorus and Zimisces would not suffer their royal
pupil to sleep in the palace. His long and frequent expeditions against
the Saracens were rather glorious than useful to the empire; but the
final destruction of the kingdom of Bulgaria appears, since the time of
Belisarius, the most important triumph of the Roman arms. Yet, instead
of applauding their victorious prince, his subjects detested the
rapacious and rigid avarice of Basil; and in the imperfect narrative of
his exploits, we can only discern the courage, patience, and
ferociousness of a soldier. A vicious education, which could not subdue
his spirit, had clouded his mind; he was ignorant of every science; and
the remembrance of his learned and feeble grandsire might encourage his
real or affected contempt of laws and lawyers, of artists and arts. Of
such a character, in such an age, superstition took a firm and lasting
possession; after the first license of his youth, Basil the Second
devoted his life, in the palace and the camp, to the penance of a
hermit, wore the monastic habit under his robes and armor, observed a
vow of continence, and imposed on his appetites a perpetual abstinence
from wine and flesh. In the sixty-eighth year of his age, his martial
spirit urged him to embark in person for a holy war against the Saracens
of Sicily; he was prevented by death, and Basil, surnamed the Slayer of
the Bulgarians, was dismissed from the world with the blessings of the
clergy and the curse of the people. After his decease, his brother
Constantine enjoyed, about three years, the power, or rather the
pleasures, of royalty; and his only care was the settlement of the
succession. He had enjoyed sixty-six years the title of Augustus; and
the reign of the two brothers is the longest, and most obscure, of the
Byzantine history.</p></li>

<li><p>A horrid narrative of the victims whom he sacrificed by poison or
the sword, by the sea or the flames, would be less expressive of his
cruelty than the appellation of the halcyon days, which was applied to a
rare and bloodless week of repose: the tyrant strove to transfer, on the
laws and the judges, some portion of his guilt; but the mask was fallen,
and his subjects could no longer mistake the true author of their
calamities. The noblest of the Greeks, more especially those who, by
descent or alliance, might dispute the Comnenian inheritance, escaped
from the monster’s den: Nice and Prusa, Sicily or Cyprus, were their
places of refuge; and as their flight was already criminal, they
aggravated their offence by an open revolt, and the Imperial title. Yet
Andronicus resisted the daggers and swords of his most formidable
enemies: Nice and Prusa were reduced and chastised: the Sicilians were
content with the sack of Thessalonica; and the distance of Cyprus was
not more propitious to the rebel than to the tyrant. His throne was
subverted by a rival without merit, and a people without arms. Isaac
Angelus, a descendant in the female line from the great Alexius, was
marked as a victim by the prudence or superstition of the emperor. ^! In
a moment of despair, Angelus defended his life and liberty, slew the
executioner, and fled to the church of St. Sophia. The sanctuary was
insensibly filled with a curious and mournful crowd, who, in his fate,
prognosticated their own. But their lamentations were soon turned to
curses, and their curses to threats: they dared to ask, “Why do we fear?
why do we obey? We are many, and he is one: our patience is the only
bond of our slavery.“ With the dawn of day the city burst into a general
sedition, the prisons were thrown open, the coldest and most servile
were roused to the defence of their country, and Isaac, the second of
the name, was raised from the sanctuary to the throne. Unconscious of
his danger, the tyrant was absent; withdrawn from the toils of state, in
the delicious islands of the Propontis. He had contracted an indecent
marriage with Alice, or Agnes, daughter of Lewis the Seventh, of France,
and relict of the unfortunate Alexius; and his society, more suitable to
his temper than to his age, was composed of a young wife and a favorite
concubine. On the first alarm, he rushed to Constantinople, impatient
for the blood of the guilty; but he was astonished by the silence of the
palace, the tumult of the city, and the general desertion of mankind.
Andronicus proclaimed a free pardon to his subjects; they neither
desired, nor would grant, forgiveness; he offered to resign the crown to
his son Manuel; but the virtues of the son could not expiate his
father’s crimes. The sea was still open for his retreat; but the news of
the revolution had flown along the coast; when fear had ceased,
obedience was no more: the Imperial galley was pursued and taken by an
armed brigantine; and the tyrant was dragged to the presence of Isaac
Angelus, loaded with fetters, and a long chain round his neck. His
eloquence, and the tears of his female companions, pleaded in vain for
his life; but, instead of the decencies of a legal execution, the new
monarch abandoned the criminal to the numerous sufferers, whom he had
deprived of a father, a husband, or a friend. His teeth and hair, an eye
and a hand, were torn from him, as a poor compensation for their loss:
and a short respite was allowed, that he might feel the bitterness of
death. Astride on a camel, without any danger of a rescue, he was
carried through the city, and the basest of the populace rejoiced to
trample on the fallen majesty of their prince. After a thousand blows
and outrages, Andronicus was hung by the feet, between two pillars, that
supported the statues of a wolf and an a sow; and every hand that could
reach the public enemy, inflicted on his body some mark of ingenious or
brutal cruelty, till two friendly or furious Italians, plunging their
swords into his body, released him from all human punishment. In this
long and painful agony, “Lord, have mercy upon me!“ and “Why will you
bruise a broken reed?“ were the only words that escaped from his mouth.
Our hatred for the tyrant is lost in pity for the man; nor can we blame
his pusillanimous resignation, since a Greek Christian was no longer
master of his life.</p></li>
<li><p>: Fallmerayer (Geschichte des Kaiserthums von Trapezunt, p. 29,
33) has highly drawn the character of Andronicus. In his view the
extermination of the Byzantine factions and dissolute nobility was part
of a deep-laid and splendid plan for the regeneration of the empire. It
was necessary for the wise and benevolent schemes of the father of his
people to lop off those limbs which were infected with irremediable
pestilence -</p></li>

<li><p>For a while Edessa had braved the Persian assaults; but the
chosen city, the spouse of Christ, was involved in the common ruin; and
his divine resemblance became the slave and trophy of the infidels.
After a servitude of three hundred years, the Palladium was yielded to
the devotion of Constantinople, for a ransom of twelve thousand pounds
of silver, the redemption of two hundred Mussulmans, and a perpetual
truce for the territory of Edessa. ^16 In this season of distress and
dismay, the eloquence of the monks was exercised in the defence of
images; and they attempted to prove, that the sin and schism of the
greatest part of the Orientals had forfeited the favor, and annihilated
the virtue, of these precious symbols. But they were now opposed by the
murmurs of many simple or rational Christians, who appealed to the
evidence of texts, of facts, and of the primitive times, and secretly
desired the reformation of the church. As the worship of images had
never been established by any general or positive law, its progress in
the Eastern empire had been retarded, or accelerated, by the differences
of men and manners, the local degrees of refinement, and the personal
characters of the bishops. The splendid devotion was fondly cherished by
the levity of the capital, and the inventive genius of the Byzantine
clergy; while the rude and remote districts of Asia were strangers to
this innovation of sacred luxury. Many large congregations of Gnostics
and Arians maintained, after their conversion, the simple worship which
had preceded their separation; and the Armenians, the most warlike
subjects of Rome, were not reconciled, in the twelfth century, to the
sight of images. ^17 These various denominations of men afforded a fund
of prejudice and aversion, of small account in the villages of Anatolia
or Thrace, but which, in the fortune of a soldier, a prelate, or a
eunuch, might be often connected with the powers of the church and
state.</p></li>

<li><p>I am not at leisure to examine how far the monks provoked, nor
how much they have exaggerated, their real and pretended sufferings, nor
how many lost their lives or limbs, their eyes or their beards, by the
cruelty of the emperor. ^! From the chastisement of individuals, he
proceeded to the abolition of the order; and, as it was wealthy and
useless, his resentment might be stimulated by avarice, and justified by
patriotism. The formidable name and mission of the Dragon, ^24 his
visitor-general, excited the terror and abhorrence of the black nation:
the religious communities were dissolved, the buildings were converted
into magazines, or bar racks; the lands, movables, and cattle were
confiscated; and our modern precedents will support the charge, that
much wanton or malicious havoc was exercised against the relics, and
even the books of the monasteries. With the habit and profession of
monks, the public and private worship of images was rigorously
proscribed; and it should seem, that a solemn abjuration of idolatry was
exacted from the subjects, or at least from the clergy, of the Eastern
empire. ^25</p></li>

<li><p>By the necessity of their situation, the inhabitants of Rome were
cast into the rough model of a republican government: they were
compelled to elect some judges in peace, and some leaders in war: the
nobles assembled to deliberate, and their resolves could not be executed
without the union and consent of the multitude. The style of the Roman
senate and people was revived, ^45 but the spirit was fled; and their
new independence was disgraced by the tumultuous conflict of
vicentiousness and oppression. The want of laws could only be supplied
by the influence of religion, and their foreign and domestic counsels
were moderated by the authority of the bishop. His alms, his sermons,
his correspondence with the kings and prelates of the West, his recent
services, their gratitude, and oath, accustomed the Romans to consider
him as the first magistrate or prince of the city. The Christian
humility of the popes was not offended by the name of Dominus, or Lord;
and their face and inscription are still apparent on the most ancient
coins. ^46 Their temporal dominion is now confirmed by the reverence of
a thousand years; and their noblest title is the free choice of a
people, whom they had redeemed from slavery.</p></li>

Byzantine Romans, whom, indeed, he admits to be the genuine descendants
of Romulus. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>Gregory had implored the aid of the hero of the age, of Charles
Martel, who governed the French monarchy with the humble title of mayor
or duke; and who, by his signal victory over the Saracens, had saved his
country, and perhaps Europe, from the Mahometan yoke. The ambassadors of
the pope were received by Charles with decent reverence; but the
greatness of his occupations, and the shortness of his life, prevented
his interference in the affairs of Italy, except by a friendly and
ineffectual mediation. His son Pepin, the heir of his power and virtues,
assumed the office of champion of the Roman church; and the zeal of the
French prince appears to have been prompted by the love of glory and
religion. But the danger was on the banks of the Tyber, the succor on
those of the Seine, and our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant
misery. Amidst the tears of the city, Stephen the Third embraced the
generous resolution of visiting in person the courts of Lombardy and
France, to deprecate the injustice of his enemy, or to excite the pity
and indignation of his friend. After soothing the public despair by
litanies and orations, he undertook this laborious journey with the
ambassadors of the French monarch and the Greek emperor. The king of the
Lombards was inexorable; but his threats could not silence the
complaints, nor retard the speed of the Roman pontiff, who traversed the
Pennine Alps, reposed in the abbey of St. Maurice, and hastened to grasp
the right hand of his protector; a hand which was never lifted in vain,
either in war or friendship. Stephen was entertained as the visible
successor of the apostle; at the next assembly, the field of March or of
May, his injuries were exposed to a devout and warlike nation, and he
repassed the Alps, not as a suppliant, but as a conqueror, at the head
of a French army, which was led by the king in person. The Lombards,
after a weak resistance, obtained an ignominious peace, and swore to
restore the possessions, and to respect the sanctity, of the Roman
church. But no sooner was Astolphus delivered from the presence of the
French arms, than he forgot his promise and resented his disgrace. Rome
was again encompassed by his arms; and Stephen, apprehensive of
fatiguing the zeal of his Transalpine allies enforced his complaint and
request by an eloquent letter in the name and person of St. Peter
himself. ^52 The apostle assures his adopted sons, the king, the clergy,
and the nobles of France, that, dead in the flesh, he is still alive in
the spirit; that they now hear, and must obey, the voice of the founder
and guardian of the Roman church; that the Virgin, the angels, the
saints, and the martyrs, and all the host of heaven, unanimously urge
the request, and will confess the obligation; that riches, victory, and
paradise, will crown their pious enterprise, and that eternal damnation
will be the penalty of their neglect, if they suffer his tomb, his
temple, and his people, to fall into the hands of the perfidious
Lombards. The second expedition of Pepin was not less rapid and
fortunate than the first: St. Peter was satisfied, Rome was again saved,
and Astolphus was taught the lessons of justice and sincerity by the
scourge of a foreign master. After this double chastisement, the
Lombards languished about twenty years in a state of languor and decay.
But their minds were not yet humbled to their condition; and instead of
affecting the pacific virtues of the feeble, they peevishly harassed the
Romans with a repetition of claims, evasions, and inroads, which they
undertook without reflection, and terminated without glory. On either
side, their expiring monarchy was pressed by the zeal and prudence of
Pope Adrian the First, the genius, the fortune, and greatness of
Charlemagne, the son of Pepin; these heroes of the church and state were
united in public and domestic friendship, and while they trampled on the
prostrate, they varnished their proceedings with the fairest colors of
equity and moderation. ^53 The passes of the Alps, and the walls of
Pavia, were the only defence of the Lombards; the former were surprised,
the latter were invested, by the son of Pepin; and after a blockade of
two years, ^</p></li>

<li><p>I shall be scarcely permitted to accuse the ambition of a
conqueror; but in a day of equal retribution, the sons of his brother
Carloman, the Merovingian princes of Aquitain, and the four thousand
five hundred Saxons who were beheaded on the same spot, would have
something to allege against the justice and humanity of Charlemagne. His
treatment of the vanquished Saxons ^98 was an abuse of the right of
conquest; his laws were not less sanguinary than his arms, and in the
discussion of his motives, whatever is subtracted from bigotry must be
imputed to temper. The sedentary reader is amazed by his incessant
activity of mind and body; and his subjects and enemies were not less
astonished at his sudden presence, at the moment when they believed him
at the most distant extremity of the empire; neither peace nor war, nor
summer nor winter, were a season of repose; and our fancy cannot easily
reconcile the annals of his reign with the geography of his expeditions.
^! But this activity was a national, rather than a personal, virtue; the
vagrant life of a Frank was spent in the chase, in pilgrimage, in
military adventures; and the journeys of Charlemagne were distinguished
only by a more numerous train and a more important purpose. His military
renown must be tried by the scrutiny of his troops, his enemies, and his
actions. Alexander conquered with the arms of Philip, but the two heroes
who preceded Charlemagne bequeathed him their name, their examples, and
the companions of their victories. At the head of his veteran and
superior armies, he oppressed the savage or degenerate nations, who were
incapable of confederating for their common safety: nor did he ever
encounter an equal antagonist in numbers, in discipline, or in arms The
science of war has been lost and revived with the arts of peace; but his
campaigns are not illustrated by any siege or battle of singular
difficulty and success; and he might behold, with envy, the Saracen
trophies of his grandfather. After the Spanish expedition, his
rear-guard was defeated in the Pyrenaean mountains; and the soldiers,
whose situation was irretrievable, and whose valor was useless, might
accuse, with their last breath, the want of skill or caution of their
general. ^99 I touch with reverence the laws of Charlemagne, so highly
applauded by a respectable judge. They compose not a system, but a
series, of occasional and minute edicts, for the correction of abuses,
the reformation of manners, the economy of his farms, the care of his
poultry, and even the sale of his eggs. He wished to improve the laws
and the character of the Franks; and his attempts, however feeble and
imperfect, are deserving of praise: the inveterate evils of the times
were suspended or mollified by his government; ^100 but in his
institutions I can seldom discover the general views and the immortal
spirit of a legislator, who survives himself for the benefit of
posterity. The union and stability of his empire depended on the life of
a single man: he imitated the dangerous practice of dividing his
kingdoms among his sons; and after his numerous diets, the whole
constitution was left to fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and
despotism. His esteem for the piety and knowledge of the clergy tempted
him to intrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion and civil
jurisdiction; and his son Lewis, when he was stripped and degraded by
the bishops, might accuse, in some measure, the imprudence of his
father. His laws enforced the imposition of tithes, because the daemons
had proclaimed in the air that the default of payment had been the cause
of the last scarcity. ^101 The literary merits of Charlemagne are
attested by the foundation of schools, the introduction of arts, the
works which were published in his name, and his familiar connection with
the subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to educate both
the prince and people. His own studies were tardy, laborious, and
imperfect; if he spoke Latin, and understood Greek, he derived the
rudiments of knowledge from conversation, rather than from books; and,
in his mature age, the emperor strove to acquire the practice of
writing, which every peasant now learns in his infancy. ^102 The grammar
and logic, the music and astronomy, of the times, were only cultivated
as the handmaids of superstition; but the curiosity of the human mind
must ultimately tend to its improvement, and the encouragement of
learning reflects the purest and most pleasing lustre on the character
of Charlemagne. ^103 The dignity of his person, ^104 the length of his
reign, the prosperity of his arms, the vigor of his government, and the
reverence of distant nations, distinguish him from the royal crowd; and
Europe dates a new aera from his restoration of the Western
empire.</p></li>

<li><p>we may be reasonably surprised that he so often preferred the
poverty of the north to the riches of the south. The three-and-thirty
campaigns laboriously consumed in the woods and morasses of Germany
would have sufficed to assert the amplitude of his title by the
expulsion of the Greeks from Italy and the Saracens from Spain. The
weakness of the Greeks would have insured an easy victory; and the holy
crusade against the Saracens would have been prompted by glory and
revenge, and loudly justified by religion and policy. Perhaps, in his
expeditions beyond the Rhine and the Elbe, he aspired to save his
monarchy from the fate of the Roman empire, to disarm the enemies of
civilized society, and to eradicate the seed of future emigrations. But
it has been wisely observed, that, in a light of precaution, all
conquest must be ineffectual, unless it could be universal, since the
increasing circle must be involved in a larger sphere of hostility. ^115
The subjugation of Germany withdrew the veil which had so long concealed
the continent or islands of Scandinavia from the knowledge of Europe,
and awakened the torpid courage of their barbarous natives. The fiercest
of the Saxon idolaters escaped from the Christian tyrant to their
brethren of the North; the Ocean and Mediterranean were covered with
their piratical fleets; and Charlemagne beheld with a sigh the
destructive progress of the Normans, who, in less than seventy years,
precipitated the fall of his race and monarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>: Had he the choice? M. Guizot has eloquently described the
position of Charlemagne towards the Saxons. Il y fit face par le
conquete; la guerre defensive prit la forme offensive: il transporta la
lutte sur le territoire des peuples qui voulaient envahir le sien: il
travailla a asservir les races etrangeres, et extirper les croyances

<li><p>His youth and manhood were of a suitable complexion; and the
nations of pilgrims could bear testimony to the charges that were urged
against him in a Roman synod, and in the presence of Otho the Great. As
John XII. had renounced the dress and decencies of his profession, the
soldier may not perhaps be dishonored by the wine which he drank, the
blood that he spilt, the flames that he kindled, or the licentious
pursuits of gaming and hunting. His open simony might be the consequence
of distress; and his blasphemous invocation of Jupiter and Venus, if it
be true, could not possibly be serious. But we read, with some surprise,
that the worthy grandson of Marozia lived in public adultery with the
matrons of Rome; that the Lateran palace was turned into a school for
prostitution, and that his rapes of virgins and widows had deterred the
female pilgrims from visiting the tomb of St. Peter, lest, in the devout
act, they should be violated by his successor. ^133 The Protestants have
dwelt with malicious pleasure on these characters of Antichrist; but to
a philosophic eye, the vices of the clergy are far less dangerous than
their virtues. After a long series of scandal, the apostolic see was
reformed and exalted by the austerity and zeal of Gregory VII. That
ambitious monk devoted his life to the execution of two projects. I. To
fix in the college of cardinals the freedom and independence of
election, and forever to abolish the right or usurpation of the emperors
and the Roman people. II. To bestow and resume the Western empire as a
fief or benefice ^134 of the church, and to extend his temporal dominion
over the kings and kingdoms of the earth. After a contest of fifty
years, the first of these designs was accomplished by the firm support
of the ecclesiastical order, whose liberty was connected with that of
their chief. But the second attempt, though it was crowned with some
partial and apparent success, has been vigorously resisted by the
secular power, and finally extinguished by the improvement of human
reason.</p></li>

<li><p>In the fortress of St. Angelo, he maintained an obstinate siege,
till the unfortunate consul was betrayed by a promise of safety: his
body was suspended on a gibbet, and his head was exposed on the
battlements of the castle. By a reverse of fortune, Otho, after
separating his troops, was besieged three days, without food, in his
palace; and a disgraceful escape saved him from the justice or fury of
the Romans. The senator Ptolemy was the leader of the people, and the
widow of Crescentius enjoyed the pleasure or the fame of revenging her
husband, by a poison which she administered to her Imperial lover. It
was the design of Otho the Third to abandon the ruder countries of the
North, to erect his throne in Italy, and to revive the institutions of
the Roman monarchy. But his successors only once in their lives appeared
on the banks of the Tyber, to receive their crown in the Vatican. ^140
Their absence was contemptible, their presence odious and formidable.

<li><p>In the Italian cities a municipal government had never been
totally abolished; and their first privileges were granted by the favor
and policy of the emperors, who were desirous of erecting a plebeian
barrier against the independence of the nobles. But their rapid
progress, the daily extension of their power and pretensions, were
founded on the numbers and spirit of these rising communities. ^143 Each
city filled the measure of her diocese or district: the jurisdiction of
the counts and bishops, of the marquises and counts, was banished from
the land; and the proudest nobles were persuaded or compelled to desert
their solitary castles, and to embrace the more honorable character of
freemen and magistrates. The legislative authority was inherent in the
general assembly; but the executive powers were intrusted to three
consuls, annually chosen from the three orders of captains, valvassors,
^144 and commons, into which the republic was divided. Under the
protection of equal law, the labors of agriculture and commerce were
gradually revived; but the martial spirit of the Lombards was nourished
by the presence of danger; and as often as the bell was rung, or the
standard ^145 erected, the gates of the city poured forth a numerous and
intrepid band, whose zeal in their own cause was soon guided by the use
and discipline of arms. At the foot of these popular ramparts, the pride
of the Caesars was overthrown; and the invincible genius of liberty
prevailed over the two Frederics, the greatest princes of the middle

undoubtedly excelled in the softer accomplishments of peace and

<li>The voluntary ^102 penance of the ascetics, the torment and glory of
their lives, was odious to a prophet who censured in his companions a
rash vow of abstaining from flesh, and women, and sleep; and firmly
declared, that he would suffer no monks in his religion. ^103 Yet he
instituted, in each year, a fast of thirty days; and strenuously
recommended the observance as a discipline which purifies the soul and
subdues the body, as a salutary exercise of obedience to the will of God
and his apostle. During the month of Ramadan, from the rising to the
setting of the sun, the Mussulman abstains from eating, and drinking,
and women, and baths, and perfumes; from all nourishment that can
restore his strength, from all pleasure that can gratify his senses. In
the revolution of the lunar year, the Ramadan coincides, by turns, with
the winter cold and the summer heat; and the patient martyr, without
assuaging his thirst with a drop of water, must expect the close of a
tedious and sultry day. The interdiction of wine, peculiar to some
orders of priests or hermits, is converted by Mahomet alone into a
positive and general law; ^104 and a considerable portion of the globe
has abjured, at his command, the use of that salutary, though dangerous,
liquor. These painful restraints are, doubtless, infringed by the
libertine, and eluded by the hypocrite; but the legislator, by whom they
are enacted, cannot surely be accused of alluring his proselytes by the
indulgence of their sensual appetites. III. The charity of the
Mahometans descends to the animal creation; and the Koran repeatedly
inculcates, not as a merit, but as a strict and indispensable duty, the
relief of the indigent and unfortunate. Mahomet, perhaps, is the only
lawgiver who has defined the precise measure of charity: the standard
may vary with the degree and nature of property, as it consists either
in money, in corn or cattle, in fruits or merchandise; but the Mussulman
does not accomplish the law, unless he bestows a tenth of his revenue;
and if his conscience accuses him of fraud or extortion, the tenth,
under the idea of restitution, is enlarged to a fifth. ^105 Benevolence
is the foundation of justice, since we are forbid to injure those whom
we are bound to assist. A prophet may reveal the secrets of heaven and
of futurity; but in his moral precepts he can only repeat the lessons of
our own hearts.</li>

<li>: Such is Mahometanism beyond the precincts of the Holy City. But
Mahomet retained, and the Koran sanctions, (Sale’s Koran, c. 5, in inlt.
c. 22, vol. ii. p. 171, 172,) the sacrifice of sheep and camels
(probably according to the old Arabian rites) at Mecca; and the pilgrims
complete their ceremonial with sacrifices, sometimes as numerous and
costly as those of King Solomon. Compare note, vol. iv. c. xxiii. p. 96,
and Forster’s Mahometanism Unveiled, vol. i. p. 420. This author quotes
the questionable authority of Benjamin of Tudela, for the sacrifice of a
camel by the caliph at Bosra; but sacrifice undoubtedly forms no part of
the ordinary Mahometan ritual; nor will the sanctity of the caliph, as
the earthly representative of the prophet, bear any close analogy to the
priesthood of the Mosaic or Gentila religions. - M.]</li>

<li><p>The fair option of friendship, or submission, or battle, was
proposed to the enemies of Mahomet. If they professed the creed of
Islam, they were admitted to all the temporal and spiritual benefits of
his primitive disciples, and marched under the same banner to extend the
religion which they had embraced. The clemency of the prophet was
decided by his interest: yet he seldom trampled on a prostrate enemy;
and he seems to promise, that on the payment of a tribute, the least
guilty of his unbelieving subjects might be indulged in their worship,
or at least in their imperfect faith. In the first months of his reign
he practised the lessons of holy warfare, and displayed his white banner
before the gates of Medina: the martial apostle fought in person at nine
battles or sieges; ^125 and fifty enterprises of war were achieved in
ten years by himself or his lieutenants. The Arab continued to unite the
professions of a merchant and a robber; and his petty excursions for the
defence or the attack of a caravan insensibly prepared his troops for
the conquest of Arabia. The distribution of the spoil was regulated by a
divine law: ^126 the whole was faithfully collected in one common mass:
a fifth of the gold and silver, the prisoners and cattle, the movables
and immovables, was reserved by the prophet for pious and charitable
uses; the remainder was shared in adequate portions by the soldiers who
had obtained the victory or guarded the camp: the rewards of the slain
devolved to their widows and orphans; and the increase of cavalry was
encouraged by the allotment of a double share to the horse and to the
man. From all sides the roving Arabs were allured to the standard of
religion and plunder: the apostle sanctified the license of embracing
the female captives as their wives or concubines, and the enjoyment of
wealth and beauty was a feeble type of the joys of paradise prepared for
the valiant martyrs of the faith. “The sword,“ says Mahomet, “is the key
of heaven and of hell; a drop of blood shed in the cause of God, a night
spent in arms, is of more avail than two months of fasting or prayer:
whosoever falls in battle, his sins are forgiven: at the day of judgment
his wounds shall be resplendent as vermilion, and odoriferous as musk;
and the loss of his limbs shall be supplied by the wings of angels and
cherubim.“ The intrepid souls of the Arabs were fired with enthusiasm:
the picture of the invisible world was strongly painted on their
imagination; and the death which they had always despised became an
object of hope and desire. The Koran inculcates, in the most absolute
sense, the tenets of fate and predestination, which would extinguish
both industry and virtue, if the actions of man were governed by his
speculative belief. Yet their influence in every age has exalted the
courage of the Saracens and Turks. The first companions of Mahomet
advanced to battle with a fearless confidence: there is no danger where
there is no chance: they were ordained to perish in their beds; or they
were safe and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy. ^127</p></li>

<li><p>seven times in the footsteps of the apostle they encompassed the
Caaba: the Koreish had retired to the hills, and Mahomet, after the
customary sacrifice, evacuated the city on the fourth day. The people
was edified by his devotion; the hostile chiefs were awed, or divided,
or seduced; and both Kaled and Amrou, the future conquerors of Syria and
Egypt, most seasonably deserted the sinking cause of idolatry. The power
of Mahomet was increased by the submission of the Arabian tribes; ten
thousand soldiers were assembled for the conquest of Mecca; and the
idolaters, the weaker party, were easily convicted of violating the
truce. Enthusiasm and discipline impelled the march, and preserved the
secret till the blaze of ten thousand fires proclaimed to the astonished
Koreish the design, the approach, and the irresistible force of the
enemy. The haughty Abu Sophian presented the keys of the city, admired
the variety of arms and ensigns that passed before him in review;
observed that the son of Abdallah had acquired a mighty kingdom, and
confessed, under the cimeter of Omar, that he was the apostle of the
true God. The return of Marius and Scylla was stained with the blood of
the Romans: the revenge of Mahomet was stimulated by religious zeal, and
his injured followers were eager to execute or to prevent the order of a
massacre. Instead of indulging their passions and his own, ^139 the
victorious exile forgave the guilt, and united the factions, of Mecca.
His troops, in three divisions, marched into the city: eight-and-twenty
of the inhabitants were slain by the sword of Caled; eleven men and six
women were proscribed by the sentence of Mahomet; but he blamed the
cruelty of his lieutenant; and several of the most obnoxious victims
were indebted for their lives to his clemency or contempt. The chiefs of
the Koreish were prostrate at his feet. “What mercy can you expect from
the man whom you have wronged?“ “We confide in the generosity of our
kinsman.“ “And you shall not confide in vain: begone! you are safe, you
are free“ The people of Mecca deserved their pardon by the profession of
Islam; and after an exile of seven years, the fugitive missionary was
enthroned as the prince and prophet of his native country. ^140 But the
three hundred and sixty idols of the Caaba were ignominiously broken:
the house of God was purified and adorned: as an example to future
times, the apostle again fulfilled the duties of a pilgrim; and a
perpetual law was enacted that no unbeliever should dare to set his foot
on the territory of the holy city. ^141</p></li>

<li><p>“Advance,“ cried Abdallah, who stepped into the vacant place,
“advance with confidence: either victory or paradise is our own.“ The
lance of a Roman decided the alternative; but the falling standard was
rescued by Caled, the proselyte of Mecca: nine swords were broken in his
hand; and his valor withstood and repulsed the superior numbers of the
Christians. In the nocturnal council of the camp he was chosen to
command: his skilful evolutions of the ensuing day secured either the
victory or the retreat of the Saracens; and Caled is renowned among his
brethren and his enemies by the glorious appellation of the Sword of
God. In the pulpit, Mahomet described, with prophetic rapture, the
crowns of the blessed martyrs; but in private he betrayed the feelings
of human nature: he was surprised as he wept over the daughter of Zeid:
“What do I see?“ said the astonished votary. “You see,“ replied the
apostle, “a friend who is deploring the loss of his most faithful
friend.“ After the conquest of Mecca, the sovereign of Arabia affected
to prevent the hostile preparations of Heraclius; and solemnly
proclaimed war against the Romans, without attempting to disguise the
hardships and dangers of the enterprise. ^147 The Moslems were
discouraged: they alleged the want of money, or horses, or provisions;
the season of harvest, and the intolerable heat of the summer: “Hell is
much hotter,“ said the indignant prophet. He disdained to compel their
service: but on his return he admonished the most guilty, by an
excommunication of fifty days. Their desertion enhanced the merit of
Abubeker, Othman, and the faithful companions who devoted their lives
and fortunes; and Mahomet displayed his banner at the head of ten
thousand horse and twenty thousand foot. Painful indeed was the distress
of the march: lassitude and thirst were aggravated by the scorching and
pestilential winds of the desert: ten men rode by turns on one camel;
and they were reduced to the shameful necessity of drinking the water
from the belly of that useful animal. In the mid-way, ten days’ journey
from Medina and Damascus, they reposed near the grove and fountain of
Tabuc. Beyond that place Mahomet declined the prosecution of the war: he
declared himself satisfied with the peaceful intentions, he was more
probably daunted by the martial array, of the emperor of the East. But
the active and intrepid Caled spread around the terror of his name; and
the prophet received the submission of the tribes and cities, from the
Euphrates to Ailah, at the head of the Red Sea. To his Christian
subjects, Mahomet readily granted the security of their persons, the
freedom of their trade, the property of their goods, and the toleration
of their worship. ^148 The weakness of their Arabian brethren had
restrained them from opposing his ambition; the disciples of Jesus were
endeared to the enemy of the Jews; and it was the interest of a
conqueror to propose a fair capitulation to the most powerful religion
of the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>: To console the afflicted relatives of his kinsman Jauffer, he
(Mahomet) represented that, in Paradise, in exchange for the arms which
he had lost, he had been furnished with a pair of wings, resplendent
with the blushing glories of the ruby, and with which he was become the
inseparable companion of the archangal Gabriel, in his volitations
through the regions of eternal bliss. Hence, in the catalogue of the
martyrs, he has been denominated Jauffer teyaur, the winged Jauffer.

visits of Gabriel, who bade an everlasting farewell to the earth, and
expressed his lively confidence, not only of the mercy, but of the
favor, of the Supreme Being. In a familiar discourse he had mentioned
his special prerogative, that the angel of death was not allowed to take
his soul till he had respectfully asked the permission of the prophet.
The request was granted; and Mahomet immediately fell into the agony of
his dissolution: his head was reclined on the lap of Ayesha, the best
beloved of all his wives; he fainted with the violence of pain;
recovering his spirits, he raised his eyes towards the roof of the
house, and, with a steady look, though a faltering voice, uttered the
last broken, though articulate, words: “O God! ….. pardon my sins…….
Yes, …… I come, …… among my fellow-citizens on high;“ and thus peaceably
expired on a carpet spread upon the floor. An expedition for the
conquest of Syria was stopped by this mournful event; the army halted at
the gates of Medina; the chiefs were assembled round their dying master.
The city, more especially the house, of the prophet, was a scene of
clamorous sorrow of silent despair: fanaticism alone could suggest a ray
of hope and consolation. “How can he be dead, our witness, our
intercessor, our mediator, with God? By God he is not dead: like Moses
and Jesus, he is wrapped in a holy trance, and speedily will he return
to his faithful people.“ The evidence of sense was disregarded; and
Omar, unsheathing his cimeter, threatened to strike off the heads of the
infidels, who should dare to affirm that the prophet was no more. The
tumult was appeased by the weight and moderation of Abubeker. “Is it
Mahomet,“ said he to Omar and the multitude, “or the God of Mahomet,
whom you worship?</p></li>
<li><p>: Major Price, who writes with the authority of one widely
conversant with the original sources of Eastern knowledge, and in a very
candid tone, takes a very different view of the prophet’s death. “In
tracing the circumstances of Mahommed’s illness, we look in vain for any
proofs of that meek and heroic firmness which might be expected to
dignify and embellish the last moments of the apostle of God. On some
occasions he betrayed such want of fortitude, such marks of childish
impatience, as are in general to be found in men only of the most
ordinary stamp; and such as extorted from his wife Ayesha, in
particular, the sarcastic remark, that in herself, or any of her family,
a similar demeanor would long since have incurred his severe
displeasure.</p></li>

<li><p>: Gibbon wrote chiefly from the Arabic or Sunnite account of
these transactions, the only sources accessible at the time when he
composed his History. Major Price, writing from Persian authorities,
affords us the advantage of comparing throughout what may be fairly
considered the Shiite Version. The glory of Ali is the constant burden
of their strain. He was destined, and, according to some accounts,
designated, for the caliphate by the prophet; but while the others were
fiercely pushing their own interests, Ali was watching the remains of
Mahomet with pious fidelity. His disinterested magnanimity, on each
separate occasion, declined the sceptre, and gave the noble example of
obedience to the appointed caliph. He is described, in retirement, on
the throne, and in the field of battle, as transcendently pious,
magnanimous, valiant, and humane. He lost his empire through his excess
of virtue and love for the faithful his life through his confidence in
God, and submission to the decrees of fate.</p></li>
<li><p>The urgency of the moment, and the acquiescence of the people,
might excuse this illegal and precipitate measure; but Omar himself
confessed from the pulpit, that if any Mulsulman should hereafter
presume to anticipate the suffrage of his brethren, both the elector and
the elected would be worthy of death. ^168 After the simple inauguration
of Abubeker, he was obeyed in Medina, Mecca, and the provinces of
Arabia: the Hashemites alone declined the oath of fidelity; and their
chief, in his own house, maintained, above six months, a sullen and
independent reserve; without listening to the threats of Omar, who
attempted to consume with fire the habitation of the daughter of the
apostle. The death of Fatima, and the decline of his party, subdued the
indignant spirit of Ali: he condescended to salute the commander of the
faithful, accepted his excuse of the necessity of preventing their
common enemies, and wisely rejected his courteous offer of abdicating
the government of the Arabians. After a reign of two years, the aged
caliph was summoned by the angel of death. In his testament, with the
tacit approbation of his companions, he bequeathed the sceptre to the
firm and intrepid virtue of Omar. “I have no occasion,“ said the modest
candidate, “for the place.“ “But the place has occasion for you,“
replied Abubeker; who expired with a fervent prayer, that the God of
Mahomet would ratify his choice, and direct the Mussulmans in the way of
concord and obedience. The prayer was not ineffectual, since Ali
himself, in a life of privacy and prayer, professed to revere the
superior worth and dignity of his rival; who comforted him for the loss
of empire, by the most flattering marks of confidence and esteem. In the
twelfth year of his reign, Omar received a mortal wound from the hand of
an assassin: he rejected with equal impartiality the names of his son
and of Ali, refused to load his conscience with the sins of his
successor, and devolved on six of the most respectable companions the
arduous task of electing a commander of the faithful. On this occasion,
Ali was again blamed by his friends ^169 for submitting his right to the
judgment of men, for recognizing their jurisdiction by accepting a place
among the six electors. He might have obtained their suffrage, had he
deigned to promise a strict and servile conformity, not only to the
Koran and tradition, but likewise to the determinations of two seniors.
^170 With these limitations, Othman, the secretary of Mahomet, accepted
the government; nor was it till after the third caliph, twenty-four
years after the death of the prophet, that Ali was invested, by the
popular choice, with the regal and sacerdotal office. The manners of the
Arabians retained their primitive simplicity, and the son of Abu Taleb
despised the pomp and vanity of this world. At the hour of prayer, he
repaired to the mosch of Medina, clothed in a thin cotton gown, a coarse
turban on his head, his slippers in one hand, and his bow in the other,
instead of a walking-staff. The companions of the prophet, and the
chiefs of the tribes, saluted their new sovereign, and gave him their
right hands as a sign of fealty and allegiance.</p></li>

<li><p>A tumultuous anarchy of five days was appeased by the
inauguration of Ali: his refusal would have provoked a general massacre.
In this painful situation he supported the becoming pride of the chief
of the Hashemites; declared that he had rather serve than reign; rebuked
the presumption of the strangers; and required the formal, if not the
voluntary, assent of the chiefs of the nation. He has never been accused
of prompting the assassin of Omar; though Persia indiscreetly celebrates
the festival of that holy martyr. The quarrel between Othman and his
subjects was assuaged by the early mediation of Ali; and Hassan, the
eldest of his sons, was insulted and wounded in the defence of the
caliph. Yet it is doubtful whether the father of Hassan was strenuous
and sincere in his opposition to the rebels; and it is certain that he
enjoyed the benefit of their crime. The temptation was indeed of such
magnitude as might stagger and corrupt the most obdurate virtue. The
ambitious candidate no longer aspired to the barren sceptre of Arabia;
the Saracens had been victorious in the East and West; and the wealthy
kingdoms of Persia, Syria, and Egypt were the patrimony of the commander
of the faithful.</p></li>

<li><p>In the first days of his reign, he neglected to secure, either by
gifts or fetters, the doubtful allegiance of Telha and Zobeir, two of
the most powerful of the Arabian chiefs. They escaped from Medina to
Mecca, and from thence to Bassora; erected the standard of revolt; and
usurped the government of Irak, or Assyria, which they had vainly
solicited as the reward of their services. The mask of patriotism is
allowed to cover the most glaring inconsistencies; and the enemies,
perhaps the assassins, of Othman now demanded vengeance for his blood.
They were accompanied in their flight by Ayesha, the widow of the
prophet, who cherished, to the last hour of her life, an implacable
hatred against the husband and the posterity of Fatima. The most
reasonable Moslems were scandalized, that the mother of the faithful
should expose in a camp her person and character; ^! but the
superstitious crowd was confident that her presence would sanctify the
justice, and assure the success, of their cause. At the head of twenty
thousand of his loyal Arabs, and nine thousand valiant auxiliaries of
Cufa, the caliph encountered and defeated the superior numbers of the
rebels under the walls of Bassora. ^!! Their leaders, Telha and Zobeir,
^@ were slain in the first battle that stained with civil blood the arms
of the Moslems. ^@@ After passing through the ranks to animate the
troops, Ayesha had chosen her post amidst the dangers of the field. In
the heat of the action, seventy men, who held the bridle of her camel,
were successively killed or wounded; and the cage or litter, in which
she sat, was stuck with javelins and darts like the quills of a
porcupine. The venerable captive sustained with firmness the reproaches
of the conqueror, and was speedily dismissed to her proper station at
the tomb of Mahomet, with the respect and tenderness that was still due
to the widow of the apostle. ^</p></li>
<li><p>The sepulchre of Ali ^175 was concealed from the tyrants of the
house of Ommiyah; ^176 but in the fourth age of the Hegira, a tomb, a
temple, a city, arose near the ruins of Cufa. ^177 Many thousands of the
Shiites repose in holy ground at the feet of the vicar of God; and the
desert is vivified by the numerous and annual visits of the Persians,

<li><p>he prepared with calm and solemn resignation to encounter his
fate. He checked the lamentations of his sister Fatima, who deplored the
impending ruin of his house. “Our trust,“ said Hosein, “is in God alone.
All things, both in heaven and earth, must perish and return to their
Creator. My brother, my father, my mother, were better than me, and
every Mussulman has an example in the prophet.“ He pressed his friends
to consult their safety by a timely flight: they unanimously refused to
desert or survive their beloved master: and their courage was fortified
by a fervent prayer and the assurance of paradise. On the morning of the
fatal day, he mounted on horseback, with his sword in one hand and the
Koran in the other: his generous band of martyrs consisted only of
thirty-two horse and forty foot; but their flanks and rear were secured
by the tent-ropes, and by a deep trench which they had filled with
lighted fagots, according to the practice of the Arabs. The enemy
advanced with reluctance, and one of their chiefs deserted, with thirty
followers, to claim the partnership of inevitable death. In every close
onset, or single combat, the despair of the Fatimites was invincible;
but the surrounding multitudes galled them from a distance with a cloud
of arrows, and the horses and men were successively slain; a truce was
allowed on both sides for the hour of prayer; and the battle at length
expired by the death of the last companions of Hosein. Alone, weary, and
wounded, he seated himself at the door of his tent. As he tasted a drop
of water, he was pierced in the mouth with a dart; and his son and
nephew, two beautiful youths, were killed in his arms. He lifted his
hands to heaven; they were full of blood; and he uttered a funeral
prayer for the living and the dead. In a transport of despair his sister
issued from the tent, and adjured the general of the Cufians, that he
would not suffer Hosein to be murdered before his eyes: a tear trickled
down his venerable beard; and the boldest of his soldiers fell back on
every side as the dying hero threw himself among them. The remorseless
Shamer, a name detested by the faithful, reproached their cowardice; and
the grandson of Mahomet was slain with three-and-thirty strokes of
lances and swords. After they had trampled on his body, they carried his
head to the castle of Cufa, and the inhuman Obeidollah struck him on the
mouth with a cane: “Alas,“ exclaimed an aged Mussulman, “on these lips
have I seen the lips of the apostle of God!“ In a distant age and
climate, the tragic scene of the death of Hosein will awaken the
sympathy of the coldest reader. ^179 ^</p></li>

several days in mystic and amorous converse. An obscure sentence of his
Koran, or book, is yet extant; ^3 and in the pride of his mission,
Moseilama condescended to offer a partition of the earth. The proposal

tribute of seventy thousand pieces of gold. The conquerors, and even
their historians, were astonished by the dawn of their future greatness:
“In the same year,“ says Elmacin, “Caled fought many signal battles: an
immense multitude of the infidels was slaughtered; and spoils infinite
and innumerable were acquired by the victorious Moslems.“ ^17 But the
invincible Caled was soon transferred to the Syrian war: the invasion of
the Persian frontier was conducted by less active or less prudent
commanders: the Saracens were repulsed with loss in the passage of the
Euphrates; and, though they chastised the insolent pursuit of the
Magians, their remaining forces still hovered in the desert of Babylon.

was reechoed to the tent of Rustam, who, far unlike the ancient hero of
his name, was gently reclining in a cool and tranquil shade, amidst the
baggage of his camp, and the train of mules that were laden with gold
and silver. On the sound of danger he started from his couch; but his
flight was overtaken by a valiant Arab, who caught him by the foot,
struck off his head, hoisted it on a lance, and instantly returning to
the field of battle, carried slaughter and dismay among the thickest
ranks of the Persians. The Saracens confess a loss of seven thousand
five hundred men; ^! and the battle of Cadesia is justly described by
the epithets of obstinate and atrocious. ^21 The standard of the
monarchy was overthrown and captured in the field - a leathern apron of
a blacksmith, who in ancient times had arisen the deliverer of Persia;
but this badge of heroic poverty was disguised, and almost concealed, by
a profusion of precious gems. ^22 After this victory, the wealthy
province of Irak, or Assyria, submitted to the caliph, and his conquests
were firmly established by the speedy foundation of Bassora, ^23 a place
which ever commands the trade and navigation of the Persians. As the
distance of fourscore miles from the Gulf, the Euphrates and Tigris
unite in a broad and direct current, which is aptly styled the river of
the Arabs. In the midway, between the junction and the mouth of these
famous streams, the new settlement was planted on the western bank: the
first colony was composed of eight hundred Moslems; but the influence of
the situation soon reared a flourishing and populous capital. The air,
though excessively hot, is pure and healthy: the meadows are filled with
palm- trees and cattle; and one of the adjacent valleys has been
celebrated among the four paradises or gardens of Asia. Under the first
caliphs the jurisdiction of this Arabian colony extended over the
southern provinces of Persia: the city has been sanctified by the tombs
of the companions and martyrs; and the vessels of Europe still frequent
the port of Bassora, as a convenient station and passage of the Indian
trade.</p></li>

<li><p>On this momentous occasion, the public voice, and the modesty of
Abu Obeidah, restored the command to the most deserving of the Moslems.
Caled assumed his station in the front, his colleague was posted in the
rear, that the disorder of the fugitive might be checked by his
venerable aspect, and the sight of the yellow banner which Mahomet had
displayed before the walls of Chaibar. The last line was occupied by the
sister of Derar, with the Arabian women who had enlisted in this holy
war, who were accustomed to wield the bow and the lance, and who in a
moment of captivity had defended, against the uncircumcised ravishers,
their chastity and religion. ^75 The exhortation of the generals was
brief and forcible: “Paradise is before you, the devil and hell-fire in
your rear.“ Yet such was the weight of the Roman cavalry, that the right
wing of the Arabs was broken and separated from the main body. Thrice
did they retreat in disorder, and thrice were they driven back to the
charge by the reproaches and blows of the women. In the intervals of
action, Abu Obeidah visited the tents of his brethren, prolonged their
repose by repeating at once the prayers of two different hours, bound up
their wounds with his own hands, and administered the comfortable
reflection, that the infidels partook of their sufferings without
partaking of their reward. Four thousand and thirty of the Moslems were
buried in the field of battle; and the skill of the Armenian archers
enabled seven hundred to boast that they had lost an eye in that
meritorious service. The veterans of the Syrian war acknowledged that it
was the hardest and most doubtful of the days which they had seen. But
it was likewise the most decisive: many thousands of the Greeks and
Syrians fell by the swords of the Arabs; many were slaughtered, after
the defeat, in the woods and mountains; many, by mistaking the ford,
were drowned in the waters of the Yermuk; and however the loss may be
magnified, ^76 the Christian writers confess and bewail the bloody
punishment of their sins. ^77 Manuel, the Roman general, was either
killed at Damascus, or took refuge in the monastery of Mount Sinai. An
exile in the Byzantine court, Jabalah lamented the manners of Arabia,
and his unlucky preference of the Christian cause. ^78 He had once
inclined to the profession of Islam; but in the pilgrimage of Mecca,
Jabalah was provoked to strike one of his brethren, and fled with
amazement from the stern and equal justice of the caliph These
victorious Saracens enjoyed at Damascus a month of pleasure and repose:
the spoil was divided by the discretion of Abu Obeidah: an equal share
was allotted to a soldier and to his horse, and a double portion was
reserved for the noble coursers of the Arabian breed.</p></li>

<li><p>After a vain attempt to dissuade the lieutenant of the caliph
from his impious enterprise, he proposed, in the name of the people, a
fair capitulation, with this extraordinary clause, that the articles of
security should be ratified by the authority and presence of Omar
himself. The question was debated in the council of Medina; the sanctity
of the place, and the advice of Ali, persuaded the caliph to gratify the
wishes of his soldiers and enemies; and the simplicity of his journey is
more illustrious than the royal pageants of vanity and oppression. The
conqueror of Persia and Syria was mounted on a red camel, which carried,
besides his person, a bag of corn, a bag of dates, a wooden dish, and a
leathern bottle of water. Wherever he halted, the company, without
distinction, was invited to partake of his homely fare, and the repast
was consecrated by the prayer and exhortation of the commander of the
faithful. ^80 But in this expedition or pilgrimage, his power was
exercised in the administration of justice: he reformed the licentious
polygamy of the Arabs, relieved the tributaries from extortion and
cruelty, and chastised the luxury of the Saracens, by despoiling them of
their rich silks, and dragging them on their faces in the dirt. When he
came within sight of Jerusalem, the caliph cried with a loud voice, “God
is victorious. O Lord, give us an easy conquest!“ and, pitching his tent
of coarse hair, calmly seated himself on the ground. After signing the
capitulation, he entered the city without fear or precaution; and
courteously discoursed with the patriarch concerning its religious
antiquities. ^81 Sophronius bowed before his new master, and secretly
muttered, in the words of Daniel, “The abomination of desolation is in
the holy place.“ ^82 At the hour of prayer they stood together in the
church of the resurrection; but the caliph refused to perform his
devotions, and contented himself with praying on the steps of the church
of Constantine. To the patriarch he disclosed his prudent and honorable
motive. “Had I yielded,“ said Omar, “to your request, the Moslems of a
future age would have infringed the treaty under color of imitating my
example.“ By his command the ground of the temple of Solomon was
prepared for the foundation of a mosch; ^83 and, during a residence of
ten days, he regulated the present and future state of his Syrian
conquests. Medina might be jealous, lest the caliph should be detained
by the sanctity of Jerusalem or the beauty of Damascus; her
apprehensions were dispelled by his prompt and voluntary return to the
tomb of the apostle. ^84</p></li>

<li><p>The fact is indeed marvellous. “Read and wonder!“ says the
historian himself: and the solitary report of a stranger who wrote at
the end of six hundred years on the confines of Media, is overbalanced
by the silence of two annalist of a more early date, both Christians,
both natives of Egypt, and the most ancient of whom, the patriarch
Eutychius, has amply described the conquest of Alexandria. ^117 The
rigid sentence of Omar is repugnant to the sound and orthodox precept of
the Mahometan casuists they expressly declare, that the religious books
of the Jews and Christians, which are acquired by the right of war,
should never be committed to the flames; and that the works of profane
science, historians or poets, physicians or philosophers, may be
lawfully applied to the use of the faithful. ^118 A more destructive
zeal may perhaps be attributed to the first successors of Mahomet; yet
in this instance, the conflagration would have speedily expired in the
deficiency of materials. I should not recapitulate the disasters of the
Alexandrian library, the involuntary flame that was kindled by Caesar in
his own defence, ^119 or the mischievous bigotry of the Christians, who
studied to destroy the monuments of idolatry. ^120 But if we gradually
descend from the age of the Antonines to that of Theodosius, we shall
learn from a chain of contemporary witnesses, that the royal palace and
the temple of Serapis no longer contained the four, or the seven,
hundred thousand volumes, which had been assembled by the curiosity and
magnificence of the Ptolemies. ^121 Perhaps the church and seat of the
patriarchs might be enriched with a repository of books; but if the
ponderous mass of Arian and Monophysite controversy were indeed consumed
in the public baths, ^122 a philosopher may allow, with a smile, that it
was ultimately devoted to the benefit of mankind. I sincerely regret the
more valuable libraries which have been involved in the ruin of the
Roman empire; but when I seriously compute the lapse of ages, the waste
of ignorance, and the calamities of war, our treasures, rather than our
losses, are the objects of my surprise. Many curious and interesting
facts are buried in oblivion: the three great historians of Rome have
been transmitted to our hands in a mutilated state, and we are deprived
of many pleasing compositions of the lyric, iambic, and dramatic poetry
of the Greeks. Yet we should gratefully remember, that the mischances of
time and accident have spared the classic works to which the suffrage of
antiquity ^123 had adjudged the first place of genius and glory: the
teachers of ancient knowledge, who are still extant, had perused and
compared the writings of their predecessors; ^124 nor can it fairly be
presumed that any important truth, any useful discovery in art or
nature, has been snatched away from the curiosity of modern
ages.</p></li>

So, also, Strabo, (l. xvii. p. 805.) Pliny (vol. vi. p. 29) says that
the canal which united the two seas was navigable, (alveus navigabilis.)
The indications furnished by Ptolemy and by the Arabic historian,
Makrisi, show that works were executed under the reign of Hadrian to
repair the canal and extend the navigation; it then received the name of
the River of Trajan Lucian, (in his Pseudomantis, p. 44,) says that he
went by water from Alexandria to Clysma, on the Red Sea. Testimonies of

<li><p>from Asia to Europe. From thence, wheeling round the Thracian
cities of the Propontis, Moslemah invested Constantinople on the land
side, surrounded his camp with a ditch and rampart, prepared and planted
his engines of assault, and declared, by words and actions, a patient
resolution of expecting the return of seed-time and harvest, should the
obstinacy of the besieged prove equal to his own. ^! The Greeks would
gladly have ransomed their religion and empire, by a fine or assessment
of a piece of gold on the head of each inhabitant of the city; but the
liberal offer was rejected with disdain, and the presumption of Moslemah
was exalted by the speedy approach and invincible force of the natives
of Egypt and Syria. They are said to have amounted to eighteen hundred
ships: the number betrays their inconsiderable size; and of the twenty
stout and capacious vessels, whose magnitude impeded their progress,
each was manned with no more than one hundred heavy-armed soldiers. This
huge armada proceeded on a smooth sea, and with a gentle gale, towards
the mouth of the Bosphorus; the surface of the strait was overshadowed,
in the language of the Greeks, with a moving forest, and the same fatal
night had been fixed by the Saracen chief for a general assault by sea
and land. To allure the confidence of the enemy, the emperor had thrown
aside the chain that usually guarded the entrance of the harbor; but
while they hesitated whether they should seize the opportunity, or
apprehend the snare, the ministers of destruction were at hand. The
fire-ships of the Greeks were launched against them; the Arabs, their
arms, and vessels, were involved in the same flames; the disorderly
fugitives were dashed against each other or overwhelmed in the waves;
and I no longer find a vestige of the fleet, that had threatened to
extirpate the Roman name. A still more fatal and irreparable loss was
that of the caliph Soliman, who died of an indigestion, ^12 in his camp
near Kinnisrin or Chalcis in Syria, as he was preparing to lead against
Constantinople the remaining forces of the East. The brother of Moslemah
was succeeded by a kinsman and an enemy; and the throne of an active and
able prince was degraded by the useless and pernicious virtues of a
bigot. ^!! While he started and satisfied the scruples of a blind
conscience, the siege was continued through the winter by the neglect,
rather than by the resolution of the caliph Omar. ^13 The winter proved
uncommonly rigorous: above a hundred days the ground was covered with
deep snow, and the natives of the sultry climes of Egypt and Arabia lay
torpid and almost lifeless in their frozen camp. They revived on the
return of spring; a second effort had been made in their favor; and
their distress was relieved by the arrival of two numerous fleets, laden
with corn, and arms, and soldiers; the first from Alexandria, of four
hundred transports and galleys; the second of three hundred and sixty
vessels from the ports of Africa. But the Greek fires were again
kindled; and if the destruction was less complete, it was owing to the
experience which had taught the Moslems to remain at a safe distance, or
to the perfidy of the Egyptian mariners, who deserted with their ships
to the emperor of the Christians. The trade and navigation of the
capital were restored; and the produce of the fisheries supplied the
wants, and even the luxury, of the inhabitants. But the calamities of
famine and disease were soon felt by the troops of Moslemah, and as the
former was miserably assuaged, so the latter was dreadfully propagated,
by the pernicious nutriment which hunger compelled them to extract from
the most unclean or unnatural food. The spirit of conquest, and even of
enthusiasm, was extinct: the Saracens could no longer struggle, beyond
their lines, either single or in small parties, without exposing
themselves to the merciless retaliation of the Thracian
peasants.</p></li>
<li><p>The march of the Arabian cavalry over the Hellespont and through
the provinces of Asia, was executed without delay or molestation; but an
army of their brethren had been cut in pieces on the side of Bithynia,

fire, that only five galleys entered the port of Alexandria to relate
the tale of their various and almost incredible disasters. ^15</p></li>

at Cufa, till the zeal of the people and the approach of his Eastern
friends allowed them to expose their persons to the impatient public. On
Friday, in the dress of a caliph, in the colors of the sect, Saffah
proceeded with religious and military pomp to the mosch: ascending the
pulpit, he prayed and preached as the lawful successor of Mahomet; and
after his departure, his kinsmen bound a willing people by an oath of
fidelity. But it was on the banks of the Zab, and not in the mosch of
Cufa, that this important controversy was determined. Every advantage
appeared to be on the side of the white faction: the authority of
established government; an army of a hundred and twenty thousand
soldiers, against a sixth part of that number; and the presence and
merit of the caliph Mervan, the fourteenth and last of the house of
Ommiyah. Before his accession to the throne, he had deserved, by his
Georgian warfare, the honorable epithet of the ass of Mesopotamia; ^36
and he might have been ranked amongst the greatest princes, had not,
says Abulfeda, the eternal order decreed that moment for the ruin of his
family; a decree against which all human fortitude and prudence must
struggle in vain. The orders of Mervan were mistaken, or disobeyed: the
return of his horse, from which he had dismounted on a necessary
occasion, impressed the belief of his death; and the enthusiasm of the
black squadrons was ably conducted by Abdallah, the uncle of his
competitor. After an irretrievab defeat, the caliph escaped to Mosul;
but the colors of the Abbassides were displayed from the rampart; he
suddenly repassed the Tigris, cast a melancholy look on his palace of
Haran, crossed the Euphrates, abandoned the fortifications of Damascus,
and, without halting in Palestine, pitched his last and fatal camp at
Busir, on the banks of the Nile. ^37 His speed was urged by the
incessant diligence of Abdallah, who in every step of the pursuit
acquired strength and reputation: the remains of the white faction were
finally vanquished in Egypt; and the lance, which terminated the life
and anxiety of Mervan, was not less welcome perhaps to the unfortunate
than to the victorious chief. The merciless inquisition of the conqueror
eradicated the most distant branches of the hostile race: their bones
were scattered, their memory was accursed, and the martyrdom of Hossein
was abundantly revenged on the posterity of his tyrants. Fourscore of
the Ommiades, who had yielded to the faith or clemency of their foes,
were invited to a banquet at Damascus. The laws of hospitality were
violated by a promiscuous massacre: the board was spread over their
fallen bodies; and the festivity of the guests was enlivened by the
music of their dying groans. By the event of the civil war, the dynasty
of the Abbassides was firmly established; but the Christians only could
triumph in the mutual hatred and common loss of the disciples of

<li><p>The unfortunate Melo ended his life a suppliant at the court of
Germany: his Norman followers, excluded from their native and their
promised land, wandered among the hills and valleys of Italy, and earned
their daily subsistence by the sword. To that formidable sword the
princes of Capua, Beneventum, Salerno, and Naples, alternately appealed
in their domestic quarrels; the superior spirit and discipline of the
Normans gave victory to the side which they espoused; and their cautious
policy observed the balance of power, lest the preponderance of any
rival state should render their aid less important, and their service
less profitable. Their first asylum was a strong camp in the depth of
the marshes of Campania: but they were soon endowed by the liberality of
the duke of Naples with a more plentiful and permanent seat. Eight miles
from his residence, as a bulwark against Capua, the town of Aversa was
built and fortified for their use; and they enjoyed as their own the
corn and fruits, the meadows and groves, of that fertile district. The
report of their success attracted every year new swarms of pilgrims and
soldiers: the poor were urged by necessity; the rich were excited by
hope; and the brave and active spirits of Normandy were impatient of
ease and ambitious of renown. The independent standard of Aversa
afforded shelter and encouragement to the outlaws of the province, to
every fugitive who had escaped from the injustice or justice of his
superiors; and these foreign associates were quickly assimilated in
manners and language to the Gallic colony. The first leader of the
Normans was Count Rainulf; and, in the origin of society, preeminence of
rank is the reward and the proof of superior merit. ^19 ^</p></li>

and head of the republic, with the principal citizens, abandoned a city
in which he could not behold, without horror, the establishment of a
foreign dominion he retired to Aversa; and when, with the assistance of
the Greeks and that of the citizens faithful to their country, he had
collected money enough to satisfy the rapacity of the Norman
adventurers, he advanced at their head to attack the garrison of the
prince of Capua, defeated it, and reentered Naples. It was then that he
confirmed the Normans in the possession of Aversa and its territory,
which he raised into a count’s fief, and granted the investiture to

famous in the next age under the name of Frederic the Second. Ten years
after this revolution, the French monarchs annexed to their crown the
duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been
transmitted, by a granddaughter of William the Conqueror, to the house
of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many

time; but he twice kissed the hand of the commander of the faithful, and
his titles were proclaimed by the voice of heralds and the applause of
the Moslems. In a second visit to Bagdad, the Seljukian prince again
rescued the caliph from his enemies and devoutly, on foot, led the
bridle of his mule from the prison to the palace. Their alliance was
cemented by the marriage of Togrul’s sister with the successor of the
prophet. Without reluctance he had introduced a Turkish virgin into his
harem; but Cayem proudly refused his daughter to the sultan, disdained
to mingle the blood of the Hashemites with the blood of a Scythian
shepherd; and protracted the negotiation many months, till the gradual
diminution of his revenue admonished him that he was still in the hands
of a master. The royal nuptials were followed by the death of Togrul
himself; ^24 ^! as he left no children, his nephew Alp Arslan succeeded
to the title and prerogatives of sultan; and his name, after that of the
caliph, was pronounced in the public prayers of the Moslems. Yet in this
revolution, the Abbassides acquired a larger measure of liberty and
power. On the throne of Asia, the Turkish monarchs were less jealous of
the domestic administration of Bagdad; and the commanders of the

against Alp Arslan and the humane victor had dropped a tear over his
grave. His five sons, strong in arms, ambitious of power, and eager for
revenge, unsheathed their cimeters against the son of Alp Arslan. The
two armies expected the signal when the caliph, forgetful of the majesty
which secluded him from vulgar eyes, interposed his venerable mediation.
“Instead of shedding the blood of your brethren, your brethren both in
descent and faith, unite your forces in a holy war against the Greeks,
the enemies of God and his apostle.“ They listened to his voice; the
sultan embraced his rebellious kinsmen; and the eldest, the valiant
Soliman, accepted the royal standard, which gave him the free conquest
and hereditary command of the provinces of the Roman empire, from
Arzeroum to Constantinople, and the unknown regions of the West. ^51
Accompanied by his four brothers, he passed the Euphrates; the Turkish
camp was soon seated in the neighborhood of Kutaieh in Phrygia; and his
flying cavalry laid waste the country as far as the Hellespont and the
Black Sea. Since the decline of the empire, the peninsula of Asia Minor
had been exposed to the transient, though destructive, inroads of the
Persians and Saracens; but the fruits of a lasting conquest were
reserved for the Turkish sultan; and his arms were introduced by the
Greeks, who aspired to reign on the ruins of their country. Since the
captivity of Romanus, six years the feeble son of Eudocia had trembled
under the weight of the Imperial crown, till the provinces of the East
and West were lost in the same month by a double rebellion: of either
chief Nicephorus was the common name; but the surnames of Bryennius and
Botoniates distinguish the European and Asiatic candidates. Their
reasons, or rather their promises, were weighed in the Divan; and, after
some hesitation, Soliman declared himself in favor of Botoniates, opened
a free passage to his troops in their march from Antioch to Nice, and
joined the banner of the Crescent to that of the Cross. After his ally
had ascended the throne of Constantinople, the sultan was hospitably
entertained in the suburb of Chrysopolis or Scutari; and a body of two
thousand Turks was transported into Europe, to whose dexterity and
courage the new emperor was indebted for the defeat and captivity of his
rival, Bryennius. But the conquest of Europe was dearly purchased by the
sacrifice of Asia: Constantinople was deprived of the obedience and
revenue of the provinces beyond the Bosphorus and Hellespont; and the
regular progress of the Turks, who fortified the passes of the rivers
and mountains, left not a hope of their retreat or expulsion. Another
candidate implored the aid of the sultan: Melissenus, in his purple
robes and red buskins, attended the motions of the Turkish camp; and the
desponding cities were tempted by the summons of a Roman prince, who
immediately surrendered them into the hands of the Barbarians. These
acquisitions were confirmed by a treaty of peace with the emperor
Alexius: his fear of Robert compelled him to seek the friendship of
Soliman; and it was not till after the sultan’s death that he extended
as far as Nicomedia, about sixty miles from Constantinople, the eastern
boundary of the Roman world. Trebizond alone, defended on either side by
the sea and mountains, preserved at the extremity of the Euxine the
ancient character of a Greek colony, and the future destiny of a
Christian empire.</p></li>

overwhelming the enemy with the armed population of a whole continent,
and repelling, if possible, the invading conqueror into his native

<li><p>Above four hundred years before the first crusade, the eastern

princes were still tyrants and usurpers, who, by the arms of war or
rebellion, might be lawfully driven from their unlawful possession.

entertainment: the treaty was sanctified by their common gospel; and a
proclamation, under pain of death, restrained the animosity and license
of the Latin soldiers. From Austria to Belgrade, they traversed the
plains of Hungary, without enduring or offering an injury; and the
proximity of Carloman, who hovered on their flanks with his numerous
cavalry, was a precaution not less useful for their safety than for his
own. They reached the banks of the Save; and no sooner had they passed
the river, than the king of Hungary restored the hostages, and saluted
their departure with the fairest wishes for the success of their
enterprise. With the same conduct and discipline, Godfrey pervaded the
woods of Bulgaria and the frontiers of Thrace; and might congratulate
himself that he had almost reached the first term of his pilgrimage,
without drawing his sword against a Christian adversary. After an easy
and pleasant journey through Lombardy, from Turin to Aquileia, Raymond
and his provincials marched forty days through the savage country of
Dalmatia ^59 and Sclavonia. The weather was a perpetual fog; the land
was mountainous and desolate; the natives were either fugitive or
hostile: loose in their religion and government, they refused to furnish
provisions or guides; murdered the stragglers; and exercised by night
and day the vigilance of the count, who derived more security from the
punishment of some captive robbers than from his interview and treaty
with the prince of Scodra. ^60 His march between Durazzo and
Constantinople was harassed, without being stopped, by the peasants and
soldiers of the Greek emperor; and the same faint and ambiguous
hostility was prepared for the remaining chiefs, who passed the Adriatic
from the coast of Italy. Bohemond had arms and vessels, and foresight
and discipline; and his name was not forgotten in the provinces of
Epirus and Thessaly. Whatever obstacles he encountered were surmounted
by his military conduct and the valor of Tancred; and if the Norman
prince affected to spare the Greeks, he gorged his soldiers with the
full plunder of an heretical castle. ^61 The nobles of France pressed
forwards with the vain and thoughtless ardor of which their nation has
been sometimes accused. From the Alps to Apulia the march of Hugh the
Great, of the two Roberts, and of Stephen of Chartres, through a wealthy
country, and amidst the applauding Catholics, was a devout or triumphant
progress: they kissed the feet of the Roman pontiff; and the golden
standard of St. Peter was delivered to the brother of the French
monarch. ^62 But in this visit of piety and pleasure, they neglected to
secure the season, and the means of their embarkation: the winter was
insensibly lost: their troops were scattered and corrupted in the towns
of Italy. They separately accomplished their passage, regardless of
safety or dignity; and within nine months from the feast of the
Assumption, the day appointed by Urban, all the Latin princes had
reached Constantinople. But the count of Vermandois was produced as a
captive; his foremost vessels were scattered by a tempest; and his
person, against the law of nations, was detained by the lieutenants of
Alexius. Yet the arrival of Hugh had been announced by four-and-twenty
knights in golden armor, who commanded the emperor to revere the general
of the Latin Christians, the brother of the king of kings. ^63

French was blind and headstrong; they might be tempted by the luxury and
wealth of Greece, and elated by the view and opinion of their invincible
strength: and Jerusalem might be forgotten in the prospect of
Constantinople. After a long march and painful abstinence, the troops of
Godfrey encamped in the plains of Thrace; they heard with indignation,
that their brother, the count of Vermandois, was imprisoned by the
Greeks; and their reluctant duke was compelled to indulge them in some
freedom of retaliation and rapine. They were appeased by the submission
of Alexius: he promised to supply their camp; and as they refused, in
the midst of winter, to pass the Bosphorus, their quarters were assigned
among the gardens and palaces on the shores of that narrow sea. But an
incurable jealousy still rankled in the minds of the two nations, who
despised each other as slaves and Barbarians. Ignorance is the ground of
suspicion, and suspicion was inflamed into daily provocations: prejudice
is blind, hunger is deaf; and Alexius is accused of a design to starve
or assault the Latins in a dangerous post, on all sides encompassed with
the waters. ^66 Godfrey sounded his trumpets, burst the net, overspread
the plain, and insulted the suburbs; but the gates of Constantinople
were strongly fortified; the ramparts were lined with archers; and,
after a doubtful conflict, both parties listened to the voice of peace
and religion. The gifts and promises of the emperor insensibly soothed
the fierce spirit of the western strangers; as a Christian warrior, he
rekindled their zeal for the prosecution of their holy enterprise, which
he engaged to second with his troops and treasures. On the return of
spring, Godfrey was persuaded to occupy a pleasant and plentiful camp in
Asia; and no sooner had he passed the Bosphorus, than the Greek vessels
were suddenly recalled to the opposite shore. The same policy was
repeated with the succeeding chiefs, who were swayed by the example, and
weakened by the departure, of their foremost companions. By his skill
and diligence, Alexius prevented the union of any two of the confederate
armies at the same moment under the walls of Constantinople; and before
the feast of the Pentecost not a Latin pilgrim was left on the coast of
Europe.</p></li>

<li><p>of nine arches, derives its name from the massy gates of the two
towers which are constructed at either end. They were opened by the
sword of the duke of Normandy: his victory gave entrance to three
hundred thousand crusaders, an account which may allow some scope for
losses and desertion, but which clearly detects much exaggeration in the
review of Nice. In the description of Antioch, ^90 it is not easy to
define a middle term between her ancient magnificence, under the
successors of Alexander and Augustus, and the modern aspect of Turkish
desolation. The Tetrapolis, or four cities, if they retained their name
and position, must have left a large vacuity in a circumference of
twelve miles; and that measure, as well as the number of four hundred
towers, are not perfectly consistent with the five gates, so often
mentioned in the history of the siege. Yet Antioch must have still
flourished as a great and populous capital. At the head of the Turkish
emirs, Baghisian, a veteran chief, commanded in the place: his garrison
was composed of six or seven thousand horse, and fifteen or twenty
thousand foot: one hundred thousand Moslems are said to have fallen by
the sword; and their numbers were probably inferior to the Greeks,
Armenians, and Syrians, who had been no more than fourteen years the
slaves of the house of Seljuk. From the remains of a solid and stately
wall, it appears to have arisen to the height of threescore feet in the
valleys; and wherever less art and labor had been applied, the ground
was supposed to be defended by the river, the morass, and the mountains.
Notwithstanding these fortifications, the city had been repeatedly taken
by the Persians, the Arabs, the Greeks, and the Turks; so large a
circuit must have yielded many pervious points of attack; and in a siege
that was formed about the middle of October, the vigor of the execution
could alone justify the boldness of the attempt. Whatever strength and
valor could perform in the field was abundantly discharged by the
champions of the cross: in the frequent occasions of sallies, of forage,
of the attack and defence of convoys, they were often victorious; and we
can only complain, that their exploits are sometimes enlarged beyond the
scale of probability and truth. The sword of Godfrey ^91 divided a Turk
from the shoulder to the haunch; and one half of the infidel fell to the
ground, while the other was transported by his horse to the city gate.
As Robert of Normandy rode against his antagonist, “I devote thy head,“
he piously exclaimed, “to the daemons of hell;“ and that head was
instantly cloven to the breast by the resistless stroke of his
descending falchion. But the reality or the report of such gigantic
prowess ^92 must have taught the Moslems to keep within their walls: and
against those walls of earth or stone, the sword and the lance were
unavailing weapons. In the slow and successive labors of a siege, the
crusaders were supine and ignorant, without skill to contrive, or money
to purchase, or industry to use, the artificial engines and implements
of assault. In the conquest of Nice, they had been powerfully assisted
by the wealth and knowledge of the Greek emperor: his absence was poorly
supplied by some Genoese and Pisan vessels, that were attracted by
religion or trade to the coast of Syria: the stores were scanty, the
return precarious, and the communication difficult and dangerous.
Indolence or weakness had prevented the Franks from investing the entire
circuit; and the perpetual freedom of two gates relieved the wants and
recruited the garrison of the city. At the end of seven months, after
the ruin of their cavalry, and an enormous loss by famine, desertion and
fatigue, the progress of the crusaders was imperceptible, and their
success remote, if the Latin Ulysses, the artful and ambitious Bohemond,
had not employed the arms of cunning and deceit. The Christians of
Antioch were numerous and discontented: Phirouz, a Syrian renegado, had
acquired the favor of the emir and the command of three towers; and the
merit of his repentance disguised to the Latins, and perhaps to himself,
the foul design of perfidy and treason. A secret correspondence, for
their mutual interest, was soon established between Phirouz and the
prince of Tarento; and Bohemond declared in the council of the chiefs,
that he could deliver the city into their hands. ^</p></li>

blotted from the book of life; and the opprobrious epithet of the
rope-dancers was applied to the deserters who dropped in the night from
the walls of Antioch. The emperor Alexius, ^98 who seemed to advance to
the succor of the Latins, was dismayed by the assurance of their
hopeless condition. They expected their fate in silent despair; oaths
and punishments were tried without effect; and to rouse the soldiers to
the defence of the walls, it was found necessary to set fire to their
quarters.</p></li>

<li><p>In the season of danger and triumph, the revelation of Bartholemy
of Marseilles was unanimously asserted; but as soon as the temporary
service was accomplished, the personal dignity and liberal arms which
the count of Tholouse derived from the custody of the holy lance,
provoked the envy, and awakened the reason, of his rivals. A Norman
clerk presumed to sift, with a philosophic spirit, the truth of the
legend, the circumstances of the discovery, and the character of the
prophet; and the pious Bohemond ascribed their deliverance to the merits
and intercession of Christ alone. For a while, the Provincials defended
their national palladium with clamors and arms and new visions condemned
to death and hell the profane sceptics who presumed to scrutinize the
truth and merit of the discovery. The prevalence of incredulity
compelled the author to submit his life and veracity to the judgment of
God. A pile of dry fagots, four feet high and fourteen long, was erected
in the midst of the camp; the flames burnt fiercely to the elevation of
thirty cubits; and a narrow path of twelve inches was left for the
perilous trial. The unfortunate priest of Marseilles traversed the fire
with dexterity and speed; but the thighs and belly were scorched by the
intense heat; he expired the next day; ^</p></li>
<li><p>and the logic of believing minds will pay some regard to his
dying protestations of innocence and truth. Some efforts were made by
the Provincials to substitute a cross, a ring, or a tabernacle, in the
place of the holy lance, which soon vanished in contempt and oblivion.
^100 Yet the revelation of Antioch is gravely asserted by succeeding
historians: and such is the progress of credulity, that miracles most
doubtful on the spot, and at the moment, will be received with implicit
faith at a convenient distance of time and space.</p></li>

susceptible of ambition and jealousy, awakened with angry clamors the
indolence of their chiefs. In the month of May, the relics of this
mighty host proceeded from Antioch to Laodicea: about forty thousand
Latins, of whom no more than fifteen hundred horse, and twenty thousand
foot, were capable of immediate service. Their easy march was continued
between Mount Libanus and the sea-shore: their wants were liberally
supplied by the coasting traders of Genoa and Pisa; and they drew large
contributions from the emirs of Tripoli, Tyre, Sidon, Acre, and
Caesarea, who granted a free passage, and promised to follow the example
of Jerusalem. From Caesarea they advanced into the midland country;

<li><p>the enemies were driven by his archers from the rampart; the
draw-bridge was let down; and on a Friday, at three in the afternoon,
the day and hour of the passion, Godfrey of Bouillon stood victorious on
the walls of Jerusalem. His example was followed on every side by the
emulation of valor; and about four hundred and sixty years after the
conquest of Omar, the holy city was rescued from the Mahometan yoke. In
the pillage of public and private wealth, the adventurers had agreed to
respect the exclusive property of the first occupant; and the spoils of
the great mosque, seventy lamps and massy vases of gold and silver,
rewarded the diligence, and displayed the generosity, of Tancred. A
bloody sacrifice was offered by his mistaken votaries to the God of the
Christians: resistance might provoke but neither age nor sex could
mollify, their implacable rage: they indulged themselves three days in a
promiscuous massacre; ^110 and the infection of the dead bodies produced
an epidemical disease. After seventy thousand Moslems had been put to
the sword, and the harmless Jews had been burnt in their synagogue, they
could still reserve a multitude of captives, whom interest or lassitude
persuaded them to spare. Of these savage heroes of the cross, Tancred
alone betrayed some sentiments of compassion; yet we may praise the more
selfish lenity of Raymond, who granted a capitulation and safe-conduct
to the garrison of the citadel. ^111 The holy sepulchre was now free;
and the bloody victors prepared to accomplish their vow. Bareheaded and
barefoot, with contrite hearts, and in an humble posture, they ascended
the hill of Calvary, amidst the loud anthems of the clergy; kissed the
stone which had covered the Savior of the world; and bedewed with tears
of joy and penitence the monument of their redemption. This union of the
fiercest and most tender passions has been variously considered by two
philosophers; by the one, ^112 as easy and natural; by the other, ^113
as absurd and incredible. Perhaps it is too rigorously applied to the
same persons and the same hour; the example of the virtuous Godfrey
awakened the piety of his companions; while they cleansed their bodies,
they purified their minds; nor shall I believe that the most ardent in
slaughter and rapine were the foremost in the procession to the holy
sepulchre.</p></li>

Ethiopians or Blacks, who were armed with flails or scourges of iron,
the Barbarians of the South fled on the first onset, and afforded a
pleasing comparison between the active valor of the Turks and the sloth
and effeminacy of the natives of Egypt. After suspending before the holy
sepulchre the sword and standard of the sultan, the new king (he
deserves the title) embraced his departing companions, and could retain
only with the gallant Tancred three hundred knights, and two thousand
foot-soldiers for the defence of Palestine. His sovereignty was soon
attacked by a new enemy, the only one against whom Godfrey was a coward.
Adhemar, bishop of Puy, who excelled both in council and action, had
been swept away in the last plague at Antioch: the remaining
ecclesiastics preserved only the pride and avarice of their character;
and their seditious clamors had required that the choice of a bishop
should precede that of a king. The revenue and jurisdiction of the
lawful patriarch were usurped by the Latin clergy: the exclusion of the
Greeks and Syrians was justified by the reproach of heresy or schism;
^116 and, under the iron yoke of their deliverers, the Oriental
Christians regretted the tolerating government of the Arabian caliphs.
Daimbert, archbishop of Pisa, had long been trained in the secret policy
of Rome: he brought a fleet at his countrymen to the succor of the Holy
Land, and was installed, without a competitor, the spiritual and

<li><p>The armies of the second crusade might have claimed the conquest
of Asia; the nobles of France and Germany were animated by the presence
of their sovereigns; and both the rank and personal character of Conrad
and Louis gave a dignity to their cause, and a discipline to their
force, which might be vainly expected from the feudatory chiefs. The
cavalry of the emperor, and that of the king, was each composed of
seventy thousand knights, and their immediate attendants in the field;
^12 and if the light-armed troops, the peasant infantry, the women and
children, the priests and monks, be rigorously excluded, the full
account will scarcely be satisfied with four hundred thousand souls. The
West, from Rome to Britain, was called into action; the kings of Poland
and Bohemia obeyed the summons of Conrad; and it is affirmed by the
Greeks and Latins, that, in the passage of a strait or river, the
Byzantine agents, after a tale of nine hundred thousand, desisted from
the endless and formidable computation. ^13 In the third crusade, as the
French and English preferred the navigation of the Mediterranean, the
host of Frederic Barbarossa was less numerous. Fifteen thousand knights,
and as many squires, were the flower of the German chivalry: sixty
thousand horse, and one hundred thousand foot, were mustered by the
emperor in the plains of Hungary; and after such repetitions, we shall
no longer be startled at the six hundred thousand pilgrims, which
credulity has ascribed to this last emigration. ^14 Such extravagant
reckonings prove only the astonishment of contemporaries; but their
astonishment most strongly bears testimony to the existence of an
enormous, though indefinite, multitude. The Greeks might applaud their
superior knowledge of the arts and stratagems of war, but they confessed
the strength and courage of the French cavalry, and the infantry of the
Germans; ^15 and the strangers are described as an iron race, of
gigantic stature, who darted fire from their eyes, and spilt blood like
water on the ground. Under the banners of Conrad, a troop of females
rode in the attitude and armor of men; and the chief of these Amazons,
from her gilt spurs and buskins, obtained the epithet of the Golden-
footed Dame.</p></li>
<li><p>: It was this army of pilgrims, the first body of which was
headed by the archbishop of Milan and Count Albert of Blandras, which
set forth on the wild, yet, with a more disciplined army, not impolitic,
enterprise of striking at the heart of the Mahometan power, by attacking
the sultan in Bagdad. For their adventures and fate, see Wilken,
vol. ii. p. 120, andandandandc., Wichaud, book iv. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>of their humanity, from the massacre of the Christian people, a
friendly city, who came out to meet them with palms and crosses in their
hands. The arms of Conrad and Louis were less cruel and imprudent; but
the event of the second crusade was still more ruinous to Christendom;
and the Greek Manuel is accused by his own subjects of giving seasonable
intelligence to the sultan, and treacherous guides to the Latin princes.
Instead of crushing the common foe, by a double attack at the same time
but on different sides, the Germans were urged by emulation, and the
French were retarded by jealousy. Louis had scarcely passed the
Bosphorus when he was met by the returning emperor, who had lost the
greater part of his army in glorious, but unsuccessful, actions on the
banks of the Maender. The contrast of the pomp of his rival hastened the
retreat of Conrad: ^! the desertion of his independent vassals reduced
him to his hereditary troops; and he borrowed some Greek vessels to
execute by sea the pilgrimage of Palestine. Without studying the lessons
of experience, or the nature of the war, the king of France advanced
through the same country to a similar fate. The vanguard, which bore the
royal banner and the oriflamme of St. Denys, ^21 had doubled their march
with rash and inconsiderate speed; and the rear, which the king
commanded in person, no longer found their companions in the evening
camp. In darkness and disorder, they were encompassed, assaulted, and
overwhelmed, by the innumerable host of Turks, who, in the art of war,
were superior to the Christians of the twelfth century. ^</p></li>
<li><p>: This was the design of the pilgrims under the archbishop of
Milan. See note, p. 102. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>: They descended the heights to a beautiful valley which by
beneath them. The Turks seized the heights which separated the two
divisions of the army. The modern historians represent differently the
act to which Louis owed his safety, which Gibbon has described by the
undignified phrase, “he climbed a tree.“ According to Michaud, vol. ii.
p. 164, the king got upon a rock, with his back against a tree;
according to Wilken, vol. iii., he dragged himself up to the top of the
rock by the roots of a tree, and continued to defend himself till
nightfall. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>About eight years before the first conquest of Jerusalem, he was
born of a noble family in Burgundy; at the age of three- and-twenty he
buried himself in the monastery of Citeaux, then in the primitive fervor
of the institution; at the end of two years he led forth her third
colony, or daughter, to the valley of Clairvaux ^29 in Champagne; and
was content, till the hour of his death, with the humble station of
abbot of his own community. A philosophic age has abolished, with too
liberal and indiscriminate disdain, the honors of these spiritual
heroes. The meanest among them are distinguished by some energies of the
mind; they were at least superior to their votaries and disciples; and,
in the race of superstition, they attained the prize for which such
numbers contended. In speech, in writing, in action, Bernard stood high
above his rivals and contemporaries; his compositions are not devoid of
wit and eloquence; and he seems to have preserved as much reason and
humanity as may be reconciled with the character of a saint. In a
secular life, he would have shared the seventh part of a private
inheritance; by a vow of poverty and penance, by closing his eyes
against the visible world, ^30 by the refusal of all ecclesiastical
dignities, the abbot of Clairvaux became the oracle of Europe, and the
founder of one hundred and sixty convents. Princes and pontiffs trembled
at the freedom of his apostolical censures: France, England, and Milan,
consulted and obeyed his judgment in a schism of the church: the debt
was repaid by the gratitude of Innocent the Second; and his successor,
Eugenius the Third, was the friend and disciple of the holy Bernard. It
was in the proclamation of the second crusade that he shone as the
missionary and prophet of God, who called the nations to the defence of
his holy sepulchre. ^31 At the parliament of Vezelay he spoke before the
king; and Louis the Seventh, with his nobles, received their crosses
from his hand. The abbot of Clairvaux then marched to the less easy
conquest of the emperor Conrad: ^</p></li>
<li><p>: Gibbon, whose account of the crusades is perhaps the least
accurate and satisfactory chapter in his History, has here failed in

arrest the fierce and merciless persecution of the Jews, which was

St. Bernard. See the curious extract from the History of Joseph ben

<li><p>added the kingdom of Damascus to that of Aleppo, and waged a long
and successful war against the Christians of Syria; he spread his ample
reign from the Tigris to the Nile, and the Abbassides rewarded their
faithful servant with all the titles and prerogatives of royalty. The
Latins themselves were compelled to own the wisdom and courage, and even
the justice and piety, of this implacable adversary. ^40 In his life and
government the holy warrior revived the zeal and simplicity of the first
caliphs. Gold and silk were banished from his palace; the use of wine
from his dominions; the public revenue was scrupulously applied to the
public service; and the frugal household of Noureddin was maintained
from his legitimate share of the spoil which he vested in the purchase
of a private estate.</p></li>

<li><p>concluded the second enterprise of Shiracouh; and Noureddin
reserved his abilities for a third and more propitious occasion. It was
soon offered by the ambition and avarice of Amalric or Amaury, king of
Jerusalem, who had imbibed the pernicious maxim, that no faith should be
kept with the enemies of God. ^! A religious warrior, the great master
of the hospital, encouraged him to proceed; the emperor of
Constantinople either gave, or promised, a fleet to act with the armies
of Syria; and the perfidious Christian, unsatisfied with spoil and
subsidy, aspired to the conquest of Egypt. In this emergency, the
Moslems turned their eyes towards the sultan of Damascus; the vizier,
whom danger encompassed on all sides, yielded to their unanimous wishes,
and Noureddin seemed to be tempted by the fair offer of one third of the
revenue of the kingdom. The Franks were already at the gates of Cairo;
but the suburbs, the old city, were burnt on their approach; they were
deceived by an insidious negotiation, and their vessels were unable to
surmount the barriers of the Nile. They prudently declined a contest
with the Turks in the midst of a hostile country; and Amaury retired
into Palestine with the shame and reproach that always adhere to
unsuccessful injustice. After this deliverance, Shiracouh was invested
with a robe of honor, which he soon stained with the blood of the
unfortunate Shawer. For a while, the Turkish emirs condescended to hold
the office of vizier; but this foreign conquest precipitated the fall of
the Fatimites themselves; and the bloodless change was accomplished by a
message and a word. The caliphs had been degraded by their own weakness
and the tyranny of the viziers: their subjects blushed, when the
descendant and successor of the prophet presented his naked hand to the
rude gripe of a Latin ambassador; they wept when he sent the hair of his
women, a sad emblem of their grief and terror, to excite the pity of the
sultan of Damascus. By the command of Noureddin, and the sentence of the
doctors, the holy names of Abubeker, Omar, and Othman, were solemnly
restored: the caliph Mosthadi, of Bagdad, was acknowledged in the public
prayers as the true commander of the faithful; and the green livery of
the sons of Ali was exchanged for the black color of the Abbassides. The
last of his race, the caliph Adhed, who survived only ten days, expired
in happy ignorance of his fate; his treasures secured the loyalty of the
soldiers, and silenced the murmurs of the sectaries; and in all
subsequent revolutions, Egypt has never departed from the orthodox
tradition of the Moslems. ^45</p></li>

<li><p>The royal captive was conducted to the tent of Saladin; and as he
fainted with thirst and terror, the generous victor presented him with a
cup of sherbet, cooled in snow, without suffering his companion,
Reginald of Chatillon, to partake of this pledge of hospitality and
pardon. “The person and dignity of a king,“ said the sultan, “are
sacred, but this impious robber must instantly acknowledge the prophet,
whom he has blasphemed, or meet the death which he has so often
deserved.“ On the proud or conscientious refusal of the Christian
warrior, Saladin struck him on the head with his cimeter, and Reginald
was despatched by the guards. ^61 The trembling Lusignan was sent to
Damascus, to an honorable prison and speedy ransom; but the victory was
stained by the execution of two hundred and thirty knights of the
hospital, the intrepid champions and martyrs of their faith. The kingdom
was left without a head; and of the two grand masters of the military
orders, the one was slain and the other was a prisoner. From all the
cities, both of the sea-coast and the inland country, the garrisons had
been drawn away for this fatal field: Tyre and Tripoli alone could
escape the rapid inroad of Saladin; and three months after the battle of
Tiberias, he appeared in arms before the gates of Jerusalem.

^55 In the navigation ^56 from Venice and Zara, the fleet was
successfully steered by the skill and experience of the Venetian pilots:
at Durazzo, the confederates first landed on the territories of the
Greek empire: the Isle of Corfu afforded a station and repose; they
doubled, without accident, the perilous cape of Malea, the southern
point of Peloponnesus or the Morea; made a descent in the islands of
Negropont and Andros; and cast anchor at Abydus on the Asiatic side of
the Hellespont. These preludes of conquest were easy and bloodless: the
Greeks of the provinces, without patriotism or courage, were crushed by
an irresistible force: the presence of the lawful heir might justify
their obedience; and it was rewarded by the modesty and discipline of
the Latins. As they penetrated through the Hellespont, the magnitude of
their navy was compressed in a narrow channel, and the face of the
waters was darkened with innumerable sails. They again expanded in the
basin of the Propontis, and traversed that placid sea, till they
approached the European shore, at the abbey of St. Stephen, three
leagues to the west of Constantinople. The prudent doge dissuaded them
from dispersing themselves in a populous and hostile land; and, as their
stock of provisions was reduced, it was resolved, in the season of
harvest, to replenish their store-ships in the fertile islands of the
Propontis. With this resolution, they directed their course: but a
strong gale, and their own impatience, drove them to the eastward; and
so near did they run to the shore and the city, that some volleys of
stones and darts were exchanged between the ships and the rampart. As
they passed along, they gazed with admiration on the capital of the
East, or, as it should seem, of the earth; rising from her seven hills,

By the indulgence of the Angeli, he was appointed governor or duke of
Trebizond: ^21 ^! his birth gave him ambition, the revolution
independence; and, without changing his title, he reigned in peace from
Sinope to the Phasis, along the coast of the Black Sea. His nameless son
and successor ^!! is described as the vassal of the sultan, whom he
served with two hundred lances: that Comnenian prince was no more than
duke of Trebizond, and the title of emperor was first assumed by the
pride and envy of the grandson of Alexius. In the West, a third fragment
was saved from the common shipwreck by Michael, a bastard of the house
of Angeli, who, before the revolution, had been known as a hostage, a
soldier, and a rebel. His flight from the camp of the marquis Boniface
secured his freedom; by his marriage with the governor’s daughter, he
commanded the important place of Durazzo, assumed the title of despot,
and founded a strong and conspicuous principality in Epirus, Aetolia,
and Thessaly, which have ever been peopled by a warlike race. The
Greeks, who had offered their service to their new sovereigns, were
excluded by the haughty Latins ^22 from all civil and military honors,
as a nation born to tremble and obey. Their resentment prompted them to
show that they might have been useful friends, since they could be
dangerous enemies: their nerves were braced by adversity: whatever was
learned or holy, whatever was noble or valiant, rolled away into the
independent states of Trebizond, Epirus, and Nice; and a single
patrician is marked by the ambiguous praise of attachment and loyalty to
the Franks. The vulgar herd of the cities and the country would have
gladly submitted to a mild and regular servitude; and the transient
disorders of war would have been obliterated by some years of industry
and peace. But peace was banished, and industry was crushed, in the
disorders of the feudal system. The Roman emperors of Constantinople, if
they were endowed with abilities, were armed with power for the
protection of their subjects: their laws were wise, and their
administration was simple. The Latin throne was filled by a titular
prince, the chief, and often the servant, of his licentious
confederates; the fiefs of the empire, from a kingdom to a castle, were
held and ruled by the sword of the barons; and their discord, poverty,
and ignorance, extended the ramifications of tyranny to the most
sequestered villages. The Greeks were oppressed by the double weight of
the priest, who were invested with temporal power, and of the soldier,
who was inflamed by fanatic hatred; and the insuperable bar of religion
and language forever separated the stranger and the native. As long as
the crusaders were united at Constantinople, the memory of their
conquest, and the terror of their arms, imposed silence on the captive
land: their dispersion betrayed the smallness of their numbers and the
defects of their discipline; and some failures and mischances revealed
the secret, that they were not invincible. As the fears of the Greeks
abated, their hatred increased. They murdered; they conspired; and
before a year of slavery had elapsed, they implored, or accepted, the
succor of a Barbarian, whose power they had felt, and whose gratitude
they trusted. ^23</p></li>

<li><p>and repulsed the Bulgarian, who, besides his infantry, was at the
head of forty thousand horse. In this expedition, Henry felt the
difference between a hostile and a friendly country: the remaining
cities were preserved by his arms; and the savage, with shame and loss,
was compelled to relinquish his prey. The siege of Thessalonica was the
last of the evils which Calo-John inflicted or suffered: he was stabbed
in the night in his tent; and the general, perhaps the assassin, who
found him weltering in his blood, ascribed the blow, with general
applause, to the lance of St. Demetrius. ^33 After several victories,
the prudence of Henry concluded an honorable peace with the successor of
the tyrant, and with the Greek princes of Nice and Epirus. If he ceded
some doubtful limits, an ample kingdom was reserved for himself and his
feudatories; and his reign, which lasted only ten years, afforded a
short interval of prosperity and peace. Far above the narrow policy of
Baldwin and Boniface, he freely intrusted to the Greeks the most
important offices of the state and army; and this liberality of
sentiment and practice was the more seasonable, as the princes of Nice
and Epirus had already learned to seduce and employ the mercenary valor
of the Latins. It was the aim of Henry to unite and reward his deserving
subjects, of every nation and language; but he appeared less solicitous
to accomplish the impracticable union of the two churches. Pelagius, the
pope’s legate, who acted as the sovereign of Constantinople, had
interdicted the worship of the Greeks, and sternly imposed the payment
of tithes, the double procession of the Holy Ghost, and a blind
obedience to the Roman pontiff. As the weaker party, they pleaded the
duties of conscience, and implored the rights of toleration: “Our
bodies,“ they said, “are Caesar’s, but our souls belong only to God. The
persecution was checked by the firmness of the emperor: ^34 and if we
can believe that the same prince was poisoned by the Greeks themselves,
we must entertain a contemptible idea of the sense and gratitude of
mankind. His valor was a vulgar attribute, which he shared with ten
thousand knights; but Henry possessed the superior courage to oppose, in
a superstitious age, the pride and avarice of the clergy. In the
cathedral of St. Sophia he presumed to place his throne on the right
hand of the patriarch; and this presumption excited the sharpest censure
of Pope Innocent the Third. By a salutary edict, one of the first
examples of the laws of mortmain, he prohibited the alienation of fiefs:
many of the Latins, desirous of returning to Europe, resigned their
estates to the church for a spiritual or temporal reward; these holy
lands were immediately discharged from military service, and a colony of
soldiers would have been gradually transformed into a college of
priests. ^35</p></li>
<li><p>: There was no battle. On the advance of the Latins, John
suddenly broke up his camp and retreated. The Latins considered this
unexpected deliverance almost a miracle. Le Beau suggests the
probability that the detection of the Comans, who usually quitted the
camp during the heats of summer, may have caused the flight of the
Bulgarians. Nicetas, c. 8 Villebardouin, c. 225. Le Beau, vol. xvii.

<li><p>his troops were disbanded, and two years rolled away without
action or honor, till he was awakened by the dangerous alliance of
Vataces emperor of Nice, and of Azan king of Bulgaria. They besieged
Constantinople by sea and land, with an army of one hundred thousand
men, and a fleet of three hundred ships of war; while the entire force
of the Latin emperor was reduced to one hundred and sixty knights, and a
small addition of sergeants and archers. I tremble to relate, that
instead of defending the city, the hero made a sally at the head of his
cavalry; and that of forty- eight squadrons of the enemy, no more than
three escaped from the edge of his invincible sword. Fired by his
example, the infantry and the citizens boarded the vessels that anchored
close to the walls; and twenty-five were dragged in triumph into the
harbor of Constantinople. At the summons of the emperor, the vassals and
allies armed in her defence; broke through every obstacle that opposed
their passage; and, in the succeeding year, obtained a second victory
over the same enemies.</p></li>

<li><p>and the remaining Latins were without strength or suspicion. They
were informed that Alexius had passed the Hellespont; but their
apprehensions were lulled by the smallness of his original numbers; and
their imprudence had not watched the subsequent increase of his army. If
he left his main body to second and support his operations, he might
advance unperceived in the night with a chosen detachment. While some
applied scaling-ladders to the lowest part of the walls, they were
secure of an old Greek, who would introduce their companions through a
subterraneous passage into his house; they could soon on the inside
break an entrance through the golden gate, which had been long
obstructed; and the conqueror would be in the heart of the city before
the Latins were conscious of their danger. After some debate, the Caesar
resigned himself to the faith of the volunteers; they were trusty, bold,
and successful; and in describing the plan, I have already related the
execution and success. ^61 But no sooner had Alexius passed the
threshold of the golden gate, than he trembled at his own rashness; he
paused, he deliberated; till the desperate volunteers urged him
forwards, by the assurance that in retreat lay the greatest and most
inevitable danger. Whilst the Caesar kept his regulars in firm array,
the Comans dispersed themselves on all sides; an alarm was sounded, and
the threats of fire and pillage compelled the citizens to a decisive
resolution. The Greeks of Constantinople remembered their native
sovereigns; the Genoese merchants their recent alliance and Venetian
foes; every quarter was in arms; and the air resounded with a general
acclamation of “Long life and victory to Michael and John, the august
emperors of the Romans!“ Their rival, Baldwin, was awakened by the
sound; but the most pressing danger could not prompt him to draw his
sword in the defence of a city which he deserted, perhaps, with more
pleasure than regret: he fled from the palace to the seashore, where he
descried the welcome sails of the fleet returning from the vain and
fruitless attempt on Daphnusia. Constantinople was irrecoverably lost;
but the Latin emperor and the principal families embarked on board the
Venetian galleys, and steered for the Isle of Euboea, and afterwards for
Italy, where the royal fugitive was entertained by the pope and Sicilian
king with a mixture of contempt and pity. From the loss of
Constantinople to his death, he consumed thirteen years, soliciting the
Catholic powers to join in his restoration: the lesson had been familiar
to his youth; nor was his last exile more indigent or shameful than his
three former pilgrimages to the courts of Europe. His son Philip was the
heir of an ideal empire; and the pretensions of his daughter Catherine
were transported by her marriage to Charles of Valois, the brother of
Philip the Fair, king of France. The house of Courtenay was represented
in the female line by successive alliances, till the title of emperor of
Constantinople, too bulky and sonorous for a private name, modestly
expired in silence and oblivion. ^62</p></li>

forgot the merits of the convert, to join, with open or clandestine aid,
the enemies of Palaeologus. His favorite generals, of his own blood, and
family, successively deserted, or betrayed, the sacrilegious trust. His
sister Eulogia, a niece, and two female cousins, conspired against him;
another niece, Mary queen of Bulgaria, negotiated his ruin with the
sultan of Egypt; and, in the public eye, their treason was consecrated
as the most sublime virtue. ^34 To the pope’s nuncios, who urged the
consummation of the work, Palaeologus exposed a naked recital of all
that he had done and suffered for their sake. They were assured that the
guilty sectaries, of both sexes and every rank, had been deprived of
their honors, their fortunes, and their liberty; a spreading list of
confiscation and punishment, which involved many persons, the dearest to
the emperor, or the best deserving of his favor. They were conducted to
the prison, to behold four princes of the royal blood chained in the
four corners, and shaking their fetters in an agony of grief and rage.
Two of these captives were afterwards released; the one by submission,
the other by death: but the obstinacy of their two companions was
chastised by the loss of their eyes; and the Greeks, the least adverse
to the union, deplored that cruel and inauspicious tragedy. ^35
Persecutors must expect the hatred of those whom they oppress; but they
commonly find some consolation in the testimony of their conscience, the
applause of their party, and, perhaps, the success of their undertaking.
But the hypocrisy of Michael, which was prompted only by political
motives, must have forced him to hate himself, to despise his followers,
and to esteem and envy the rebel champions by whom he was detested and
despised. While his violence was abhorred at Constantinople, at Rome his
slowness was arraigned, and his sincerity suspected; till at length Pope
Martin the Fourth excluded the Greek emperor from the pale of a church,
into which he was striving to reduce a schismatic people. No sooner had
the tyrant expired, than the union was dissolved, and abjured by
unanimous consent; the churches were purified; the penitents were
reconciled; and his son Andronicus, after weeping the sins and errors of
his youth most piously denied his father the burial of a prince and a

profitably applied to arm a Catalan fleet, which sailed under a holy

Constantinople to Rome, and from Sicily to Saragossa: the treaty was

and his deed of gift transferred the fiefs of St. Peter from the house
of Anjou to that of Arragon. So widely diffused and so freely
circulated, the secret was preserved above two years with impenetrable
discretion; and each of the conspirators imbibed the maxim of Peter, who
declared that he would cut off his left hand if it were conscious of the
intentions of his right. The mine was prepared with deep and dangerous

<li><p>That prince escaped from the capital under the pretence of
hunting; erected his standard at Adrianople; and, in a few days,
assembled fifty thousand horse and foot, whom neither honor nor duty
could have armed against the Barbarians. Such a force might have saved
or commanded the empire; but their counsels were discordant, their
motions were slow and doubtful, and their progress was checked by
intrigue and negotiation. The quarrel of the two Andronici was
protracted, and suspended, and renewed, during a ruinous period of seven
years. In the first treaty, the relics of the Greek empire were divided:
Constantinople, Thessalonica, and the islands, were left to the elder,
while the younger acquired the sovereignty of the greatest part of
Thrace, from Philippi to the Byzantine limit. By the second treaty, he
stipulated the payment of his troops, his immediate coronation, and an
adequate share of the power and revenue of the state. The third civil
war was terminated by the surprise of Constantinople, the final retreat
of the old emperor, and the sole reign of his victorious grandson. The
reasons of this delay may be found in the characters of the men and of
the times. When the heir of the monarchy first pleaded his wrongs and
his apprehensions, he was heard with pity and applause: and his
adherents repeated on all sides the inconsistent promise, that he would
increase the pay of the soldiers and alleviate the burdens of the
people. The grievances of forty years were mingled in his revolt; and
the rising generation was fatigued by the endless prospect of a reign,
whose favorites and maxims were of other times. The youth of Andronicus
had been without spirit, his age was without reverence: his taxes
produced an unusual revenue of five hundred thousand pounds; yet the
richest of the sovereigns of Christendom was incapable of maintaining
three thousand horse and twenty galleys, to resist the destructive
progress of the Turks. ^9 “How different,“ said the younger Andronicus,
“is my situation from that of the son of Philip! Alexander might
complain, that his father would leave him nothing to conquer: alas! my
grandsire will leave me nothing to lose.“ But the Greeks were soon
admonished, that the public disorders could not be healed by a civil
war; and that their young favorite was not destined to be the savior of
a falling empire. On the first repulse, his party was broken by his own
levity, their intestine discord, and the intrigues of the ancient court,
which tempted each malecontent to desert or betray the cause of the
rebellion. Andronicus the younger was touched with remorse, or fatigued
with business, or deceived by negotiation: pleasure rather than power
was his aim; and the license of maintaining a thousand hounds, a
thousand hawks, and a thousand huntsmen, was sufficient to sully his
fame and disarm his ambition.</p></li>
<li><p>: The conduct of Cantacuzene, by his own showing, was
inexplicable. He was unwilling to dethrone the old emperor, and
dissuaded the immediate march on Constantinople. The young Andronicus,
he says, entered into his views, and wrote to warn the emperor of his
danger when the march was determined. Cantacuzenus, in Nov. Byz. Hist.

<li><p>which roved with impunity through the solitary courts; and a
reduced allowance of ten thousand pieces of gold ^11 was all that he
could ask, and more than he could hope. His calamities were imbittered
by the gradual extinction of sight; his confinement was rendered each
day more rigorous; and during the absence and sickness of his grandson,
his inhuman keepers, by the threats of instant death, compelled him to
exchange the purple for the monastic habit and profession. The monk
Antony had renounced the pomp of the world; yet he had occasion for a
coarse fur in the winter season, and as wine was forbidden by his
confessor, and water by his physician, the sherbet of Egypt was his
common drink. It was not without difficulty that the late emperor could
procure three or four pieces to satisfy these simple wants; and if he
bestowed the gold to relieve the more painful distress of a friend, the
sacrifice is of some weight in the scale of humanity and religion. Four
years after his abdication, Andronicus or Antony expired in a cell, in
the seventy-fourth year of his age: and the last strain of adulation
could only promise a more splendid crown of glory in heaven than he had
enjoyed upon earth. ^12 ^</p></li>

the review of his preceding conduct, Cantacuzene appears to have been
guiltless of any treasonable designs; and the only suspicion of his
innocence must arise from the vehemence of his protestations, and the
sublime purity which he ascribes to his own virtue. While the empress
and the patriarch still affected the appearances of harmony, he
repeatedly solicited the permission of retiring to a private, and even a
monastic, life. After he had been declared a public enemy, it was his
fervent wish to throw himself at the feet of the young emperor, and to
receive without a murmur the stroke of the executioner: it was not
without reluctance that he listened to the voice of reason, which
inculcated the sacred duty of saving his family and friends, and proved
that he could only save them by drawing the sword and assuming the

<ol start="870" type="1">
<li><p>The army of Cantacuzene, in sixteen divisions, was stationed on
the banks of the Melas to tempt or to intimidate the capital: it was
dispersed by treachery or fear; and the officers, more especially the
mercenary Latins, accepted the bribes, and embraced the service, of the
Byzantine court. After this loss, the rebel emperor (he fluctuated
between the two characters) took the road of Thessalonica with a chosen
remnant; but he failed in his enterprise on that important place; and he
was closely pursued by the great duke, his enemy Apocaucus, at the head
of a superior power by sea and land. Driven from the coast, in his
march, or rather flight, into the mountains of Servia, Cantacuzene
assembled his troops to scrutinize those who were worthy and willing to
accompany his broken fortunes. A base majority bowed and retired; and
his trusty band was diminished to two thousand, and at last to five
hundred, volunteers. The cral, ^28 or despot of the Servians received
him with general hospitality; but the ally was insensibly degraded to a
suppliant, a hostage, a captive; and in this miserable dependence, he
waited at the door of the Barbarian, who could dispose of the life and
liberty of a Roman emperor. The most tempting offers could not persuade
the cral to violate his trust; but he soon inclined to the stronger
side; and his friend was dismissed without injury to a new vicissitude
of hopes and perils. Near six years the flame of discord burnt with
various success and unabated rage: the cities were distracted by the
faction of the nobles and the plebeians; the Cantacuzeni and Palaeologi:
and the Bulgarians, the Servians, and the Turks, were invoked on both
sides as the instruments of private ambition and the common ruin. The
regent deplored the calamities, of which he was the author and victim:
and his own experience might dictate a just and lively remark on the
different nature of foreign and civil war. “The former,“ said he, “is
the external warmth of summer, always tolerable, and often beneficial;
the latter is the deadly heat of a fever, which consumes without a
remedy the vitals of the constitution.“ ^29</p></li>

on the side of the emperor, the aristocracy on his.</p></li>
<li><p>resolute prisoners of the Palaeologian race, ^30 who were armed
with sticks, and animated by despair. On the rumor of revenge and
liberty, the captive multitude broke their fetters, fortified their
prison, and exposed from the battlements the tyrant’s head, presuming on
the favor of the people and the clemency of the empress. Anne of Savoy
might rejoice in the fall of a haughty and ambitious minister, but while
she delayed to resolve or to act, the populace, more especially the
mariners, were excited by the widow of the great duke to a sedition, an
assault, and a massacre. The prisoners (of whom the far greater part
were guiltless or inglorious of the deed) escaped to a neighboring
church: they were slaughtered at the foot of the altar; and in his death
the monster was not less bloody and venomous than in his life. Yet his
talents alone upheld the cause of the young emperor; and his surviving
associates, suspicious of each other, abandoned the conduct of the war,
and rejected the fairest terms of accommodation. In the beginning of the
dispute, the empress felt, and complained, that she was deceived by the
enemies of Cantacuzene: the patriarch was employed to preach against the
forgiveness of injuries; and her promise of immortal hatred was sealed
by an oath, under the penalty of excommunication. ^31 But Anne soon
learned to hate without a teacher: she beheld the misfortunes of the
empire with the indifference of a stranger: her jealousy was exasperated
by the competition of a rival empress; and on the first symptoms of a
more yielding temper, she threatened the patriarch to convene a synod,
and degrade him from his office. Their incapacity and discord would have
afforded the most decisive advantage; but the civil war was protracted
by the weakness of both parties; and the moderation of Cantacuzene has
not escaped the reproach of timidity and indolence. He successively
recovered the provinces and cities; and the realm of his pupil was
measured by the walls of Constantinople; but the metropolis alone
counterbalanced the rest of the empire; nor could he attempt that
important conquest till he had secured in his favor the public voice and
a private correspondence. An Italian, of the name of Facciolati, ^32 had
succeeded to the office of great duke: the ships, the guards, and the
golden gate, were subject to his command; but his humble ambition was
bribed to become the instrument of treachery; and the revolution was
accomplished without danger or bloodshed. Destitute of the powers of
resistance, or the hope of relief, the inflexible Anne would have still
defended the palace, and have smiled to behold the capital in flames,
rather than in the possession of a rival. She yielded to the prayers of
her friends and enemies; and the treaty was dictated by the conqueror,
who professed a loyal and zealous attachment to the son of his
benefactor. The marriage of his daughter with John Palaeologus was at
length consummated: the hereditary right of the pupil was acknowledged;
but the sole administration during ten years was vested in the guardian.
Two emperors and three empresses were seated on the Byzantine throne;
and a general amnesty quieted the apprehensions, and confirmed the
property, of the most guilty subjects. The festival of the coronation
and nuptials was celebrated with the appearances of concord and
magnificence, and both were equally fallacious. During the late
troubles, the treasures of the state, and even the furniture of the
palace, had been alienated or embezzled; the royal banquet was served in
pewter or earthenware; and such was the proud poverty of the times, that
the absence of gold and jewels was supplied by the paltry artifices of
glass and gilt-leather. ^33</p></li>

<li><p>who, with many wounds, sustained the brunt of the action. On the
separation of the fleets, the event might appear doubtful; but the
thirteen Genoese galleys, that had been sunk or taken, were compensated
by a double loss of the allies; of fourteen Venetians, ten Catalans, and
two Greeks; ^! and even the grief of the conquerors expressed the
assurance and habit of more decisive victories. Pisani confessed his
defeat, by retiring into a fortified harbor, from whence, under the
pretext of the orders of the senate, he steered with a broken and flying
squadron for the Isle of Candia, and abandoned to his rivals the
sovereignty of the sea. In a public epistle, ^54 addressed to the doge
and senate, Petrarch employs his eloquence to reconcile the maritime
powers, the two luminaries of Italy. The orator celebrates the valor and
victory of the Genoese, the first of men in the exercise of naval war:
he drops a tear on the misfortunes of their Venetian brethren; but he
exhorts them to pursue with fire and sword the base and perfidious
Greeks; to purge the metropolis of the East from the heresy with which
it was infected. Deserted by their friends, the Greeks were incapable of
resistance; and three months after the battle, the emperor Cantacuzene
solicited and subscribed a treaty, which forever banished the Venetians
and Catalans, and granted to the Genoese a monopoly of trade, and almost
a right of dominion. The Roman empire (I smile in transcribing the name)
might soon have sunk into a province of Genoa, if the ambition of the
republic had not been checked by the ruin of her freedom and naval
power. A long contest of one hundred and thirty years was determined by
the triumph of Venice; and the factions of the Genoese compelled them to
seek for domestic peace under the protection of a foreign lord, the duke
of Milan, or the French king. Yet the spirit of commerce survived that
of conquest; and the colony of Pera still awed the capital and navigated
the Euxine, till it was involved by the Turks in the final servitude of
Constantinople itself.</p></li>

<li><p>In his ascent to greatness, that Barbarian (whose private
appellation was Temugin) had trampled on the necks of his equals. His
birth was noble; but it was the pride of victory, that the prince or
people deduced his seventh ancestor from the immaculate conception of a
virgin. His father had reigned over thirteen hordes, which composed
about thirty or forty thousand families: above two thirds refused to pay
tithes or obedience to his infant son; and at the age of thirteen,
Temugin fought a battle against his rebellious subjects. The future
conqueror of Asia was reduced to fly and to obey; but he rose superior
to his fortune, and in his fortieth year he had established his fame and
dominion over the circumjacent tribes. In a state of society, in which
policy is rude and valor is universal, the ascendant of one man must be
founded on his power and resolution to punish his enemies and recompense
his friends. His first military league was ratified by the simple rites
of sacrificing a horse and tasting of a running stream: Temugin pledged
himself to divide with his followers the sweets and the bitters of life;
and when he had shared among them his horses and apparel, he was rich in
their gratitude and his own hopes. After his first victory, he placed
seventy caldrons on the fire, and seventy of the most guilty rebels were
cast headlong into the boiling water. The sphere of his attraction was
continually enlarged by the ruin of the proud and the submission of the
prudent; and the boldest chieftains might tremble, when they beheld,
enchased in silver, the skull of the khan of Keraites; ^2 who, under the
name of Prester John, had corresponded with the Roman pontiff and the
princes of Europe. The ambition of Temugin condescended to employ the
arts of superstition; and it was from a naked prophet, who could ascend
to heaven on a white horse, that he accepted the title of Zingis, ^3 the
most great; and a divine right to the conquest and dominion of the
earth. In a general couroultai, or diet, he was seated on a felt, which
was long afterwards revered as a relic, and solemnly proclaimed great
khan, or emperor of the Moguls ^4 and Tartars. ^5 Of these kindred,
though rival, names, the former had given birth to the imperial race;
and the latter has been extended by accident or error over the spacious
wilderness of the north.</p></li>

<li><p>The Catholic inquisitors of Europe, who defended nonsense by
cruelty, might have been confounded by the example of a Barbarian, who
anticipated the lessons of philosophy, ^6 and established by his laws a
system of pure theism and perfect toleration. His first and only article
of faith was the existence of one God, the Author of all good; who fills
by his presence the heavens and earth, which he has created by his
power. The Tartars and Moguls were addicted to the idols of their
peculiar tribes; and many of them had been converted by the foreign
missionaries to the religions of Moses, of Mahomet, and of Christ. These
various systems in freedom and concord were taught and practised within
the precincts of the same camp; and the Bonze, the Imam, the Rabbi, the
Nestorian, and the Latin priest, enjoyed the same honorable exemption
from service and tribute: in the mosque of Bochara, the insolent victor
might trample the Koran under his horse’s feet, but the calm legislator
respected the prophets and pontiffs of the most hostile sects. The
reason of Zingis was not informed by books: the khan could neither read
nor write; and, except the tribe of the Igours, the greatest part of the
Moguls and Tartars were as illiterate as their sovereign. ^</p></li>
<li><p>: Before his armies entered Thibet, he sent an embassy to
Bogdosottnam Dsimmo, a Lama high priest, with a letter to this effect:
“I have chosen thee as high priest for myself and my empire. Repair then
to me, and promote the present and future happiness of man: I will be
thy supporter and protector: let us establish a system of religion, and
unite it with the monarchy,“ andandandandc. The high priest accepted the
invitation; and the Mongol history literally terms this step the period
of the first respect for religion; because the monarch, by his public
profession, made it the religion of the state. Klaproth. “Travels in
Caucasus,“ ch. 7, Eng. Trans. p. 92. Neither Dshingis nor his son and
successor Oegodah had, on account of their continual wars, much leisure
for the propagation of the religion of the Lama. By religion they
understand a distinct, independent, sacred moral code, which has but one
origin, one source, and one object. This notion they universally
propagate, and even believe that the brutes, and all created beings,
have a religion adapted to their sphere of action. The different forms
of the various religions they ascribe to the difference of individuals,
nations, and legislators. Never do you hear of their inveighing against
any creed, even against the obviously absurd Schaman paganism, or of
their persecuting others on that account. They themselves, on the other
hand, endure every hardship, and even persecutions, with perfect
resignation, and indulgently excuse the follies of others, nay, consider
them as a motive for increased arder in prayer, ch. ix. p. 109. -

the Moguls in writing, of which they were before ignorant;“ and hence
the application of the Ouigour characters to the Mogul language cannot

Pa-sse-pa, who lived under Khubilai. A new alphabet, approaching to that

<li><p>The destructive hostilities of Attila and the Huns have long
since been elucidated by the example of Zingis and the Moguls; and in
this more proper place I shall be content to observe, that, from the
Caspian to the Indus, they ruined a tract of many hundred miles, which
was adorned with the habitations and labors of mankind, and that five
centuries have not been sufficient to repair the ravages of four years.
The Mogul emperor encouraged or indulged the fury of his troops: the
hope of future possession was lost in the ardor of rapine and slaughter;
and the cause of the war exasperated their native fierceness by the
pretence of justice and revenge. The downfall and death of the sultan
Mohammed, who expired, unpitied and alone, in a desert island of the
Caspian Sea, is a poor atonement for the calamities of which he was the
author. Could the Carizmian empire have been saved by a single hero, it
would have been saved by his son Gelaleddin, whose active valor
repeatedly checked the Moguls in the career of victory. Retreating, as
he fought, to the banks of the Indus, he was oppressed by their
innumerable host, till, in the last moment of despair, Gelaleddin
spurred his horse into the waves, swam one of the broadest and most
rapid rivers of Asia, and extorted the admiration and applause of Zingis
himself. It was in this camp that the Mogul conqueror yielded with
reluctance to the murmurs of his weary and wealthy troops, who sighed
for the enjoyment of their native land. Eucumbered with the spoils of
Asia, he slowly measured back his footsteps, betrayed some pity for the
misery of the vanquished, and declared his intention of rebuilding the
cities which had been swept away by the tempest of his arms. After he
had repassed the Oxus and Jaxartes, he was joined by two generals, whom
he had detached with thirty thousand horse, to subdue the western
provinces of Persia. They had trampled on the nations which opposed
their passage, penetrated through the gates of Derbent, traversed the
Volga and the desert, and accomplished the circuit of the Caspian Sea,
by an expedition which had never been attempted, and has never been
repeated. The return of Zingis was signalized by the overthrow of the
rebellious or independent kingdoms of Tartary; and he died in the
fulness of years and glory, with his last breath exhorting and
instructing his sons to achieve the conquest of the Chinese empire.

<li><p>the grandson of Zingis, the brother and lieutenant of the two
successive emperors, Mangou and Cublai. I shall not enumerate the crowd
of sultans, emirs, and atabeks, whom he trampled into dust; but the
extirpation of the Assassins, or Ismaelians ^24 of Persia, may be
considered as a service to mankind. Among the hills to the south of the
Caspian, these odious sectaries had reigned with impunity above a
hundred and sixty years; and their prince, or Imam, established his
lieutenant to lead and govern the colony of Mount Libanus, so famous and
formidable in the history of the crusades. ^25 With the fanaticism of
the Koran the Ismaelians had blended the Indian transmigration, and the
visions of their own prophets; and it was their first duty to devote
their souls and bodies in blind obedience to the vicar of God. The
daggers of his missionaries were felt both in the East and West: the
Christians and the Moslems enumerate, and persons multiply, the
illustrious victims that were sacrificed to the zeal, avarice, or
resentment of the old man (as he was corruptly styled) of the mountain.
But these daggers, his only arms, were broken by the sword of Holagou,
and not a vestige is left of the enemies of mankind, except the word
assassin, which, in the most odious sense, has been adopted in the
languages of Europe. The extinction of the Abbassides cannot be
indifferent to the spectators of their greatness and decline. Since the
fall of their Seljukian tyrants the caliphs had recovered their lawful
dominion of Bagdad and the Arabian Irak; but the city was distracted by
theological factions, and the commander of the faithful was lost in a
harem of seven hundred conubines. The invasion of the Moguls he
encountered with feeble arms and haughty embassies. “On the divine
decree,“ said the caliph Mostasem, “is founded the throne of the sons of
Abbas: and their foes shall surely be destroyed in this world and in the
next. Who is this Holagou that dares to rise against them? If he be
desirous of peace, let him instantly depart from the sacred territory;
and perhaps he may obtain from our clemency the pardon of his fault.“
This presumption was cherished by a perfidious vizier, who assured his
master, that, even if the Barbarians had entered the city, the women and
children, from the terraces, would be sufficient to overwhelm them with
stones. But when Holagou touched the phantom, it instantly vanished into
smoke. After a siege of two months, Bagdad was stormed and sacked by the
Moguls; ^</p></li>

<li><p>they approached the shores of the Baltic; and in the battle of
Lignitz they defeated the dukes of Silesia, the Polish palatines, and
the great master of the Teutonic order, and filled nine sacks with the
right ears of the slain. From Lignitz, the extreme point of their
western march, they turned aside to the invasion of Hungary; and the
presence or spirit of Batou inspired the host of five hundred thousand
men: the Carpathian hills could not be long impervious to their divided
columns; and their approach had been fondly disbelieved till it was
irresistibly felt. The king, Bela the Fourth, assembled the military
force of his counts and bishops; but he had alienated the nation by
adopting a vagrant horde of forty thousand families of Comans, and these
savage guests were provoked to revolt by the suspicion of treachery and
the murder of their prince. The whole country north of the Danube was
lost in a day, and depopulated in a summer; and the ruins of cities and
churches were overspread with the bones of the natives, who expiated the
sins of their Turkish ancestors. An ecclesiastic, who fled from the sack
of Waradin, describes the calamities which he had seen, or suffered; and
the sanguinary rage of sieges and battles is far less atrocious than the
treatment of the fugitives, who had been allured from the woods under a
promise of peace and pardon and who were coolly slaughtered as soon as
they had performed the labors of the harvest and vintage. In the winter
the Tartars passed the Danube on the ice, and advanced to Gran or
Strigonium, a German colony, and the metropolis of the kingdom. Thirty
engines were planted against the walls; the ditches were filled with
sacks of earth and dead bodies; and after a promiscuous massacre, three
hundred noble matrons were slain in the presence of the khan. Of all the
cities and fortresses of Hungary, three alone survived the Tartar
invasion, and the unfortunate Bata hid his head among the islands of the
Adriatic.</p></li>

<li><p>The northern, and by degrees the southern, empire acquiesced in
the government of Cublai, the lieutenant, and afterwards the successor,
of Mangou; and the nation was loyal to a prince who had been educated in
the manners of China. He restored the forms of her venerable
constitution; and the victors submitted to the laws, the fashions, and
even the prejudices, of the vanquished people. This peaceful triumph,
which has been more than once repeated, may be ascribed, in a great
measure, to the numbers and servitude of the Chinese. The Mogul army was
dissolved in a vast and populous country; and their emperors adopted
with pleasure a political system, which gives to the prince the solid
substance of despotism, and leaves to the subject the empty names of
philosophy, freedom, and filial obedience. ^</p></li>

<li><p>and a different habit distinguished the citizens from the
peasants, the Moslems from the infidels. All the troops of Othman had
consisted of loose squadrons of Turkman cavalry; who served without pay
and fought without discipline: but a regular body of infantry was first
established and trained by the prudence of his son. A great number of
volunteers was enrolled with a small stipend, but with the permission of
living at home, unless they were summoned to the field: their rude
manners, and seditious temper, disposed Orchan to educate his young
captives as his soldiers and those of the prophet; but the Turkish
peasants were still allowed to mount on horseback, and follow his
standard, with the appellation and the hopes of freebooters. ^! By these
arts he formed an army of twenty-five thousand Moslems: a train of
battering engines was framed for the use of sieges; and the first
successful experiment was made on the cities of Nice and Nicomedia.
Orchan granted a safe-conduct to all who were desirous of departing with
their families and effects; but the widows of the slain were given in
marriage to the conquerors; and the sacrilegious plunder, the books, the
vases, and the images, were sold or ransomed at Constantinople. The
emperor Andronicus the Younger was vanquished and wounded by the son of
Othman: ^42 ^!! he subdued the whole province or kingdom of Bithynia, as
far as the shores of the Bosphorus and Hellespont; and the Christians
confessed the justice and clemency of a reign which claimed the
voluntary attachment of the Turks of Asia. Yet Orchan was content with
the modest title of emir; and in the list of his compeers, the princes
of Roum or Anatolia, ^43 his military forces were surpassed by the emirs
of Ghermian and Caramania, each of whom could bring into the field an
army of forty thousand men. Their domains were situate in the heart of
the Seljukian kingdom; but the holy warriors, though of inferior note,
who formed new principalities on the Greek empire, are more conspicuous
in the light of history. The maritime country from the Propontis to the
Maeander and the Isle of Rhodes, so long threatened and so often
pillaged, was finally lost about the thirteenth year of Andronicus the
Elder. ^44 Two Turkish chieftains, Sarukhan and Aidin, left their names
to their conquests, and their conquests to their posterity. The
captivity or ruin of the seven churches of Asia was consummated; and the
barbarous lords of Ionia and Lydia still trample on the monuments of
classic and Christian antiquity. In the loss of Ephesus, the Christians
deplored the fall of the first angel, the extinction of the first
candlestick, of the Revelations; ^45 the desolation is complete; and the
temple of Diana, or the church of Mary, will equally elude the search of
the curious traveller. The circus and three stately theatres of Laodicea
are now peopled with wolves and foxes; Sardes is reduced to a miserable
village; the God of Mahomet, without a rival or a son, is invoked in the
mosques of Thyatira and Pergamus; and the populousness of Smyrna is
supported by the foreign trade of the Franks and Armenians. Philadelphia
alone has been saved by prophecy, or courage. At a distance from the
sea, forgotten by the emperors, encompassed on all sides by the Turks,
her valiant citizens defended their religion and freedom above fourscore
years; and at length capitulated with the proudest of the Ottomans.
Among the Greek colonies and churches of Asia, Philadelphia is still
erect; a column in a scene of ruins; a pleasing example, that the paths
of honor and safety may sometimes be the same. The servitude of Rhodes
was delayed about two centuries by the establishment of the knights of
St. John of Jerusalem: ^46 under the discipline of the order, that
island emerged into fame and opulence; the noble and warlike monks were
renowned by land and sea: and the bulwark of Christendom provoked, and
repelled, the arms of the Turks and Saracens.</p></li>

<li><p>Such was the origin of these haughty troops, the terror of the
nations, and sometimes of the sultans themselves. Their valor has
declined, their discipline is relaxed, and their tumultuary array is
incapable of contending with the order and weapons of modern tactics;
but at the time of their institution, they possessed a decisive
superiority in war; since a regular body of infantry, in constant
exercise and pay, was not maintained by any of the princes of
Christendom. The Janizaries fought with the zeal of proselytes against
their idolatrous countrymen; and in the battle of Cossova, the league
and independence of the Sclavonian tribes was finally crushed. As the
conqueror walked over the field, he observed that the greatest part of
the slain consisted of beardless youths; and listened to the flattering
reply of his vizier, that age and wisdom would have taught them not to
oppose his irresistible arms. But the sword of his Janizaries could not
defend him from the dagger of despair; a Servian soldier started from
the crowd of dead bodies, and Amurath was pierced in the belly with a
mortal wound. ^</p></li>
<li><p>: According to Von Hammer. vol. i. p. 90, Gibbon and the European
writers assign too late a date to this enrolment of the Janizaries. It
took place not in the reign of Amurath, but in that of his predecessor
Orchan. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>: Ducas has related this as a deliberate act of self-devotion on
the part of a Servian noble who pretended to desert, and stabbed Amurath
during a conference which he had requested. The Italian translator of
Ducas, published by Bekker in the new edition of the Byzantines, has
still further heightened the romance. See likewise in Von Hammer
(Osmanische Geschichte, vol. i. p. 138) the popular Servian account,
which resembles that of Ducas, and may have been the source of that of
his Italian translator. The Turkish account agrees more nearly with
Gibbon; but the Servian, (Milosch Kohilovisch) while he lay among the
heap of the dead, pretended to have some secret to impart to Amurath,
and stabbed him while he leaned over to listen. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>These splendid names were the source of presumption and the bane
of discipline. So many might aspire to command, that none were willing
to obey; their national spirit despised both their enemies and their
allies; and in the persuasion that Bajazet would fly, or must fall, they
began to compute how soon they should visit Constantinople and deliver
the holy sepulchre. When their scouts announced the approach of the
Turks, the gay and thoughtless youths were at table, already heated with
wine; they instantly clasped their armor, mounted their horses, rode
full speed to the vanguard, and resented as an affront the advice of
Sigismond, which would have deprived them of the right and honor of the
foremost attack. The battle of Nicopolis would not have been lost, if
the French would have obeyed the prudence of the Hungarians; but it
might have been gloriously won, had the Hungarians imitated the valor of
the French. They dispersed the first line, consisting of the troops of
Asia; forced a rampart of stakes, which had been planted against the
cavalry; broke, after a bloody conflict, the Janizaries themselves; and
were at length overwhelmed by the numerous squadrons that issued from
the woods, and charged on all sides this handful of intrepid warriors.
In the speed and secrecy of his march, in the order and evolutions of
the battle, his enemies felt and admired the military talents of
Bajazet. They accuse his cruelty in the use of victory. After reserving
the count of Nevers, and four-and-twenty lords, ^</p></li>

<li><p>and the two emperors were buried in the tower from whence the two
prisoners were exalted to the throne. Another period of two years
afforded Palaeologus and Manuel the means of escape: it was contrived by
the magic or subtlety of a monk, who was alternately named the angel or
the devil: they fled to Scutari; their adherents armed in their cause;
and the two Byzantine factions displayed the ambition and animosity with
which Caesar and Pompey had disputed the empire of the world. The Roman
world was now contracted to a corner of Thrace, between the Propontis
and the Black Sea, about fifty miles in length and thirty in breadth; a
space of ground not more extensive than the lesser principalities of
Germany or Italy, if the remains of Constantinople had not still
represented the wealth and populousness of a kingdom. To restore the
public peace, it was found necessary to divide this fragment of the
empire; and while Palaeologus and Manuel were left in possession of the
capital, almost all that lay without the walls was ceded to the blind
princes, who fixed their residence at Rhodosto and Selybria. In the
tranquil slumber of royalty, the passions of John Palaeologus survived
his reason and his strength: he deprived his favorite and heir of a
blooming princess of Trebizond; and while the feeble emperor labored to
consummate his nuptials, Manuel, with a hundred of the noblest Greeks,
was sent on a peremptory summons to the Ottoman porte. They served with
honor in the wars of Bajazet; but a plan of fortifying Constantinople
excited his jealousy: he threatened their lives; the new works were
instantly demolished; and we shall bestow a praise, perhaps above the
merit of Palaeologus, if we impute this last humiliation as the cause of
his death.</p></li>

Zagatai and the East, a nominal khan served as a private officer in the

and in breadth, might have satisfied the ambition of a subject; but
Timour aspired to the dominion of the world; and before his death, the
crown of Zagatai was one of the twenty- seven crowns which he had placed
on his head. Without expatiating on the victories of thirty-five

<li><p>Between the Jihoon and the Indus they crossed one of the ridges
of mountains, which are styled by the Arabian geographers The Stony
Girdles of the Earth. The highland robbers were subdued or extirpated;
but great numbers of men and horses perished in the snow; the emperor
himself was let down a precipice on a portable scaffold - the ropes were
one hundred and fifty cubits in length; and before he could reach the
bottom, this dangerous operation was five times repeated. Timour crossed
the Indus at the ordinary passage of Attok; and successively traversed,
in the footsteps of Alexander, the Punjab, or five rivers, ^25 that fall
into the master stream. From Attok to Delhi, the high road measures no
more than six hundred miles; but the two conquerors deviated to the
south-east; and the motive of Timour was to join his grandson, who had
achieved by his command the conquest of Moultan. On the eastern bank of
the Hyphasis, on the edge of the desert, the Macedonian hero halted and
wept: the Mogul entered the desert, reduced the fortress of Batmir, and
stood in arms before the gates of Delhi, a great and flourishing city,
which had subsisted three centuries under the dominion of the Mahometan
kings. ^! The siege, more especially of the castle, might have been a
work of time; but he tempted, by the appearance of weakness, the sultan
Mahmoud and his vizier to descend into the plain, with ten thousand
cuirassiers, forty thousand of his foot-guards, and one hundred and
twenty elephants, whose tusks are said to have been armed with sharp and
poisoned daggers. Against these monsters, or rather against the
imagination of his troops, he condescended to use some extraordinary
precautions of fire and a ditch, of iron spikes and a rampart of
bucklers; but the event taught the Moguls to smile at their own fears;
and as soon as these unwieldy animals were routed, the inferior species
(the men of India) disappeared from the field. Timour made his triumphal
entry into the capital of Hindostan; and admired, with a view to

<li><p>had provoked a mutiny among the Turks; and even his son Soliman
too hastily withdrew from the field. The forces of Anatolia, loyal in
their revolt, were drawn away to the banners of their lawful princes.
His Tartar allies had been tempted by the letters and emissaries of
Timour; ^44 who reproached their ignoble servitude under the slaves of
their fathers; and offered to their hopes the dominion of their new, or
the liberty of their ancient, country. In the right wing of Bajazet the
cuirassiers of Europe charged, with faithful hearts and irresistible
arms: but these men of iron were soon broken by an artful flight and
headlong pursuit; and the Janizaries, alone, without cavalry or missile
weapons, were encompassed by the circle of the Mogul hunters. Their
valor was at length oppressed by heat, thirst, and the weight of
numbers; and the unfortunate sultan, afflicted with the gout in his
hands and feet, was transported from the field on the fleetest of his
horses. He was pursued and taken by the titular khan of Zagatai; and,
after his capture, and the defeat of the Ottoman powers, the kingdom of
Anatolia submitted to the conqueror, who planted his standard at
Kiotahia, and dispersed on all sides the ministers of rapine and
destruction. Mirza Mehemmed Sultan, the eldest and best beloved of his
grandsons, was despatched to Boursa, with thirty thousand horse; and
such was his youthful ardor, that he arrived with only four thousand at
the gates of the capital, after performing in five days a march of two
hundred and thirty miles. Yet fear is still more rapid in its course;
and Soliman, the son of Bajazet, had already passed over to Europe with
the royal treasure. The spoil, however, of the palace and city was
immense: the inhabitants had escaped; but the buildings, for the most
part of wood, were reduced to ashes From Boursa, the grandson of Timour
advanced to Nice, ever yet a fair and flourishing city; and the Mogul
squadrons were only stopped by the waves of the Propontis. The same
success attended the other mirzas and emirs in their excursions; and
Smyrna, defended by the zeal and courage of the Rhodian knights, alone
deserved the presence of the emperor himself. After an obstinate
defence, the place was taken by storm: all that breathed was put to the
sword; and the heads of the Christian heroes were launched from the
engines, on board of two carracks, or great ships of Europe, that rode
at anchor in the harbor. The Moslems of Asia rejoiced in their
deliverance from a dangerous and domestic foe; and a parallel was drawn
between the two rivals, by observing that Timour, in fourteen days, had
reduced a fortress which had sustained seven years the siege, or at
least the blockade, of Bajazet. ^45</p></li>

<li><p>But the strength of his mind and body fainted under the trial,
and his premature death might, without injustice, be ascribed to the
severity of Timour. He warred not with the dead: a tear and a sepulchre
were all that he could bestow on a captive who was delivered from his
power; and if Mousa, the son of Bajazet, was permitted to reign over the
ruins of Boursa, the greatest part of the province of Anatolia had been
restored by the conqueror to their lawful sovereigns.</p></li>
<li><p>: Von Hammer’s explanation of this contested point is both simple
and satisfactory. It originates in a mistake in the meaning of the
Turkish word kafe, which means a covered litter or palanquin drawn by
two horses, and is generally used to convey the harem of an Eastern
monarch. In such a litter, with the lattice-work made of iron, Bajazet
either chose or was constrained to travel. This was either mistaken for,
or transformed by, ignorant relaters into a cage. The European
Schiltberger, the two oldest of the Turkish historians, and the most
valuable of the later compilers, Seadeddin, describe this litter.
Seadeddin discusses the question with some degree of historical
criticism, and ascribes the choice of such a vehicle to the indignant
state of Bajazet’s mind, which would not brook the sight of his Tartar
conquerors. Von Hammer, p. 320. - M.]</p></li>

<li><p>after a reign of seven years and ten months. 4. The investiture
of Mousa degraded him as the slave of the Moguls: his tributary kingdom
of Anatolia was confined within a narrow limit, nor could his broken
militia and empty treasury contend with the hardy and veteran bands of
the sovereign of Romania. Mousa fled in disguise from the palace of
Boursa; traversed the Propontis in an open boat; wandered over the
Walachian and Servian hills; and after some vain attempts, ascended the
throne of Adrianople, so recently stained with the blood of Soliman. In
a reign of three years and a half, his troops were victorious against
the Christians of Hungary and the Morea; but Mousa was ruined by his
timorous disposition and unseasonable clemency. After resigning the
sovereignty of Anatolia, he fell a victim to the perfidy of his
ministers, and the superior ascendant of his brother Mahomet. 5. The
final victory of Mahomet was the just recompense of his prudence and
moderation. Before his father’s captivity, the royal youth had been
intrusted with the government of Amasia, thirty days’ journey from
Constantinople, and the Turkish frontier against the Christians of
Trebizond and Georgia. The castle, in Asiatic warfare, was esteemed
impregnable; and the city of Amasia, ^74 which is equally divided by the
River Iris, rises on either side in the form of an amphitheatre, and
represents on a smaller scale the image of Bagdad. In his rapid career,
Timour appears to have overlooked this obscure and contumacious angle of
Anatolia; and Mahomet, without provoking the conqueror, maintained his
silent independence, and chased from the province the last stragglers of
the Tartar host. ^! He relieved himself from the dangerous neighborhood
of Isa; but in the contests of their more powerful brethren his firm
neutrality was respected; till, after the triumph of Mousa, he stood
forth the heir and avenger of the unfortunate Soliman. Mahomet obtained
Anatolia by treaty, and Romania by arms; and the soldier who presented
him with the head of Mousa was rewarded as the benefactor of his king
and country. The eight years of his sole and peaceful reign were
usefully employed in banishing the vices of civil discord, and restoring
on a firmer basis the fabric of the Ottoman monarchy. His last care was
the choice of two viziers, Bajazet and Ibrahim, ^75 who might guide the
youth of his son Amurath; and such was their union and prudence, that
they concealed above forty days the emperor’s death, till the arrival of
his successor in the palace of Boursa. A new war was kindled in Europe
by the prince, or impostor, Mustapha; the first vizier lost his army and
his head; but the more fortunate Ibrahim, whose name and family are
still revered, extinguished the last pretender to the throne of Bajazet,
and closed the scene of domestic hostility.</p></li>

mothers from a village, Dugundschi, whose inhabitants had suffered

which satisfied the thirst of his friend Petrarch, and which, perhaps,
in the succeeding century, was clandestinely used by Laurentius Valla,
the Latin interpreter. It was from his narratives that the same Boccace
collected the materials for his treatise on the genealogy of the heathen
gods, a work, in that age, of stupendous erudition, and which he
ostentatiously sprinkled with Greek characters and passages, to excite
the wonder and applause of his more ignorant readers. ^94 The first
steps of learning are slow and laborious; no more than ten votaries of
Homer could be enumerated in all Italy; and neither Rome, nor Venice,
nor Naples, could add a single name to this studious catalogue. But
their numbers would have multiplied, their progress would have been
accelerated, if the inconstant Leo, at the end of three years, had not
relinquished an honorable and beneficial station. In his passage,
Petrarch entertained him at Padua a short time: he enjoyed the scholar,
but was justly offended with the gloomy and unsocial temper of the man.
Discontented with the world and with himself, Leo depreciated his
present enjoyments, while absent persons and objects were dear to his
imagination. In Italy he was a Thessalian, in Greece a native of
Calabria: in the company of the Latins he disdained their language,
religion, and manners: no sooner was he landed at Constantinople, than
he again sighed for the wealth of Venice and the elegance of Florence.
His Italian friends were deaf to his importunity: he depended on their
curiosity and indulgence, and embarked on a second voyage; but on his
entrance into the Adriatic, the ship was assailed by a tempest, and the
unfortunate teacher, who like Ulysses had fastened himself to the mast,
was struck dead by a flash of lightning. The humane Petrarch dropped a
tear on his disaster; but he was most anxious to learn whether some copy
of Euripides or Sophocles might not be saved from the hands of the
mariners. ^95</p></li>

<li><p>Under his reign, the soldier was ever victorious, the citizen
rich and secure. If he subdued any country, his first care was to build
mosques and caravansaras, hospitals, and colleges. Every year he gave a
thousand pieces of gold to the sons of the Prophet; and sent two
thousand five hundred to the religious persons of Mecca, Medina, and
Jerusalem.“ ^11 This portrait is transcribed from the historian of the
Othman empire: but the applause of a servile and superstitious people
has been lavished on the worst of tyrants; and the virtues of a sultan
are often the vices most useful to himself, or most agreeable to his
subjects. A nation ignorant of the equal benefits of liberty and law,
must be awed by the flashes of arbitrary power: the cruelty of a despot
will assume the character of justice; his profusion, of liberality; his
obstinacy, of firmness. If the most reasonable excuse be rejected, few
acts of obedience will be found impossible; and guilt must tremble,
where innocence cannot always be secure. The tranquillity of the people,
and the discipline of the troops, were best maintained by perpetual
action in the field; war was the trade of the Janizaries; and those who
survived the peril, and divided the spoil, applauded the generous
ambition of their sovereign. To propagate the true religion, was the
duty of a faithful Mussulman: the unbelievers were his enemies, and
those of the Prophet; and, in the hands of the Turks, the scimeter was
the only instrument of conversion. Under these circumstances, however,
the justice and moderation of Amurath are attested by his conduct, and
acknowledged by the Christians themselves; who consider a prosperous
reign and a peaceful death as the reward of his singular merits. In the
vigor of his age and military power, he seldom engaged in war till he
was justified by a previous and adequate provocation: the victorious
sultan was disarmed by submission; and in the observance of treaties,
his word was inviolate and sacred. ^12 The Hungarians were commonly the
aggressors; he was provoked by the revolt of Scanderbeg; and the
perfidious Caramanian was twice vanquished, and twice pardoned, by the
Ottoman monarch. Before he invaded the Morea, Thebes had been surprised
by the despot: in the conquest of Thessalonica, the grandson of Bajazet
might dispute the recent purchase of the Venetians; and after the first
siege of Constantinople, the sultan was never tempted, by the distress,
the absence, or the injuries of Palaeologus, to extinguish the dying
light of the Byzantine empire.</p></li>

<li><p>in endless rotation with the fanatics, who mistook the giddiness
of the head for the illumination of the spirit. ^15 But he was soon
awakened from his dreams of enthusiasm by the Hungarian invasion; and
his obedient son was the foremost to urge the public danger and the
wishes of the people. Under the banner of their veteran leader, the
Janizaries fought and conquered but he withdrew from the field of Varna,
again to pray, to fast, and to turn round with his Magnesian brethren.
These pious occupations were again interrupted by the danger of the
state. A victorious army disdained the inexperience of their youthful
ruler: the city of Adrianople was abandoned to rapine and slaughter; and
the unanimous divan implored his presence to appease the tumult, and
prevent the rebellion, of the Janizaries. At the well-known voice of
their master, they trembled and obeyed; and the reluctant sultan was
compelled to support his splendid servitude, till at the end of four
years, he was relieved by the angel of death. Age or disease, misfortune
or caprice, have tempted several princes to descend from the throne; and
they have had leisure to repent of their irretrievable step. But Amurath
alone, in the full liberty of choice, after the trial of empire and
solitude, has repeated his preference of a private life.</p></li>
<li><p>: Gibbon has fallen into a remarkable error. The unmonastic
retreat of Amurath was that of an epicurean rather than of a dervis;
more like that of Sardanapalus than of Charles the Fifth. Profane, not
divine, love was its chief occupation: the only dance, that described by
Horace as belonging to the country, motus doceri gaudet Ionicos. See Von

<li><p>His sobriety is attested by the silence of the Turkish annals,
which accuse three, and three only, of the Ottoman line of the vice of
drunkenness. ^8 But it cannot be denied that his passions were at once
furious and inexorable; that in the palace, as in the field, a torrent
of blood was spilt on the slightest provocation; and that the noblest of
the captive youth were often dishonored by his unnatural lust. In the
Albanian war he studied the lessons, and soon surpassed the example, of
his father; and the conquest of two empires, twelve kingdoms, and two
hundred cities, a vain and flattering account, is ascribed to his
invincible sword. He was doubtless a soldier, and possibly a general;
Constantinople has sealed his glory; but if we compare the means, the
obstacles, and the achievements, Mahomet the Second must blush to
sustain a parallel with Alexander or Timour. Under his command, the
Ottoman forces were always more numerous than their enemies; yet their
progress was bounded by the Euphrates and the Adriatic; and his arms
were checked by Huniades and Scanderbeg, by the Rhodian knights and by

his accession and solicit his friendship; and to all he spoke the

was revived by the solemn oaths and fair assurances with which he sealed
the ratification of the treaty: and a rich domain on the banks of the
Strymon was assigned for the annual payment of three hundred thousand
aspers, the pension of an Ottoman prince, who was detained at his
request in the Byzantine court. Yet the neighbors of Mahomet might
tremble at the severity with which a youthful monarch reformed the pomp
of his father’s household: the expenses of luxury were applied to those
of ambition, and a useless train of seven thousand falconers was either
dismissed from his service, or enlisted in his troops. ^! In the first
summer of his reign, he visited with an army the Asiatic provinces; but
after humbling the pride, Mahomet accepted the submission, of the
Caramanian, that he might not be diverted by the smallest obstacle from
the execution of his great design. ^10</p></li>

capable of throwing a ball or stone of sufficient size to batter the
walls of Constantinople? I am not ignorant of their strength; but were
they more solid than those of Babylon, I could oppose an engine of
superior power: the position and management of that engine must be left

Adrianople: the metal was prepared; and at the end of three months,
Urban produced a piece of brass ordnance of stupendous, and almost
incredible magnitude; a measure of twelve palms is assigned to the bore;

<li><p>Perhaps he was softened by the last extremity o their distress;
but his compassion was tardy; his efforts were faint and unavailing; and
Constantinople had fallen, before the squadrons of Genoa and Venice
could sail from their harbors. ^27 Even the princes of the Morea and of
the Greek islands affected a cold neutrality: the Genoese colony of
Galata negotiated a private treaty; and the sultan indulged them in the
delusive hope, that by his clemency they might survive the ruin of the
empire. A plebeian crowd, and some Byzantine nobles basely withdrew from
the danger of their country; and the avarice of the rich denied the
emperor, and reserved for the Turks, the secret treasures which might
have raised in their defence whole armies of mercenaries. ^28 The
indigent and solitary prince prepared, however, to sustain his
formidable adversary; but if his courage were equal to the peril, his
strength was inadequate to the contest. In the beginning of the spring,
the Turkish vanguard swept the towns and villages as far as the gates of
Constantinople: submission was spared and protected; whatever presumed
to resist was exterminated with fire and sword. The Greek places on the
Black Sea, Mesembria, Acheloum, and Bizon, surrendered on the first
summons; Selybria alone deserved the honors of a siege or blockade; and
the bold inhabitants, while they were invested by land, launched their
boats, pillaged the opposite coast of Cyzicus, and sold their captives
in the public market. But on the approach of Mahomet himself all was
silent and prostrate: he first halted at the distance of five miles; and
from thence advancing in battle array, planted before the gates of
St. Romanus the Imperial standard; and on the sixth day of April formed
the memorable siege of Constantinople.</p></li>

gunpowder superseded the use of the liquid and unextinguishable fire. A
wooden turret of the largest size was advanced on rollers this portable
magazine of ammunition and fascines was protected by a threefold
covering of bulls’ hides: incessant volleys were securely discharged
from the loop-holes; in the front, three doors were contrived for the
alternate sally and retreat of the soldiers and workmen. They ascended
by a staircase to the upper platform, and, as high as the level of that
platform, a scaling-ladder could be raised by pulleys to form a bridge,
and grapple with the adverse rampart. By these various arts of
annoyance, some as new as they were pernicious to the Greeks, the tower
of St. Romanus was at length overturned: after a severe struggle, the
Turks were repulsed from the breach, and interrupted by darkness; but
they trusted that with the return of light they should renew the attack
with fresh vigor and decisive success. Of this pause of action, this
interval of hope, each moment was improved, by the activity of the
emperor and Justiniani, who passed the night on the spot, and urged the
labors which involved the safety of the church and city. At the dawn of
day, the impatient sultan perceived, with astonishment and grief, that
his wooden turret had been reduced to ashes: the ditch was cleared and
restored; and the tower of St. Romanus was again strong and entire. He
deplored the failure of his design; and uttered a profane exclamation,
that the word of the thirty-seven thousand prophets should not have
compelled him to believe that such a work, in so short a time, could
have been accomplished by the infidels.</p></li>

rod: ^46 his death had been pronounced; and he adored the clemency of

Greeks, and accused the supineness of their Western allies. Amidst the
deserts of Anatolia and the rocks of Palestine, the millions of the
crusades had buried themselves in a voluntary and inevitable grave; but
the situation of the Imperial city was strong against her enemies, and
accessible to her friends; and a rational and moderate armament of the
marine states might have saved the relics of the Roman name, and
maintained a Christian fortress in the heart of the Ottoman empire. Yet
this was the sole and feeble attempt for the deliverance of
Constantinople: the more distant powers were insensible of its danger;

Turkish camp, to remove the fears, and to direct the operations, of the

and, as the road must be opened behind the suburb of Galata, their free
passage or total destruction must depend on the option of the Genoese.
But these selfish merchants were ambitious of the favor of being the
last devoured; and the deficiency of art was supplied by the strength of
obedient myraids. A level way was covered with a broad platform of
strong and solid planks; and to render them more slippery and smooth,
they were anointed with the fat of sheep and oxen. Fourscore light
galleys and brigantines, of fifty and thirty oars, were disembarked on
the Bosphorus shore; arranged successively on rollers; and drawn
forwards by the power of men and pulleys. Two guides or pilots were
stationed at the helm, and the prow, of each vessel: the sails were
unfurled to the winds; and the labor was cheered by song and
acclamation. In the course of a single night, this Turkish fleet
painfully climbed the hill, steered over the plain, and was launched
from the declivity into the shallow waters of the harbor, far above the
molestation of the deeper vessels of the Greeks. The real importance of
this operation was magnified by the consternation and confidence which
it inspired: but the notorious, unquestionable fact was displayed before
the eyes, and is recorded by the pens, of the two nations. ^48 A similar
stratagem had been repeatedly practised by the ancients; ^49 the Ottoman
galleys (I must again repeat) should be considered as large boats; and,
if we compare the magnitude and the distance, the obstacles and the
means, the boasted miracle ^50 has perhaps been equalled by the industry
of our own times. ^51 As soon as Mahomet had occupied the upper harbor
with a fleet and army, he constructed, in the narrowest part, a bridge,
or rather mole, of fifty cubits in breadth, and one hundred in length:
it was formed of casks and hogsheads; joined with rafters, linked with
iron, and covered with a solid floor. On this floating battery he
planted one of his largest cannon, while the fourscore galleys, with
troops and scaling ladders, approached the most accessible side, which
had formerly been stormed by the Latin conquerors. The indolence of the
Christians has been accused for not destroying these unfinished works;
^! but their fire, by a superior fire, was controlled and silenced; nor
were they wanting in a nocturnal attempt to burn the vessels as well as
the bridge of the sultan. His vigilance prevented their approach; their
foremost galiots were sunk or taken; forty youths, the bravest of Italy
and Greece, were inhumanly massacred at his command; nor could the
emperor’s grief be assuaged by the just though cruel retaliation, of
exposing from the walls the heads of two hundred and sixty Mussulman
captives. After a siege of forty days, the fate of Constantinople could
no longer be averted. The diminutive garrison was exhausted by a double
attack: the fortifications, which had stood for ages against hostile
violence, were dismantled on all sides by the Ottoman cannon: many
breaches were opened; and near the gate of St. Romanus, four towers had
been levelled with the ground. For the payment of his feeble and
mutinous troops, Constantine was compelled to despoil the churches with
the promise of a fourfold restitution; and his sacrilege offered a new
reproach to the enemies of the union. A spirit of discord impaired the
remnant of the Christian strength; the Genoese and Venetian auxiliaries
asserted the preeminence of their respective service; and Justiniani and
the great duke, whose ambition was not extinguished by the common
danger, accused each other of treachery and cowardice.</p></li>

could be productive of strength, or in the vain hope, that amid the
crowd each individual might be safe and invisible. From every part of
the capital, they flowed into the church of St. Sophia: in the space of
an hour, the sanctuary, the choir, the nave, the upper and lower
galleries, were filled with the multitudes of fathers and husbands, of
women and children, of priests, monks, and religious virgins: the doors
were barred on the inside, and they sought protection from the sacred
dome, which they had so lately abhorred as a profane and polluted
edifice. Their confidence was founded on the prophecy of an enthusiast
or impostor; that one day the Turks would enter Constantinople, and
pursue the Romans as far as the column of Constantine in the square
before St. Sophia: but that this would be the term of their calamities:
that an angel would descend from heaven, with a sword in his hand, and
would deliver the empire, with that celestial weapon, to a poor man
seated at the foot of the column. “Take this sword,“ would he say, “and
avenge the people of the Lord.“ At these animating words, the Turks
would instantly fly, and the victorious Romans would drive them from the
West, and from all Anatolia as far as the frontiers of Persia. It is on
this occasion that Ducas, with some fancy and much truth, upbraids the
discord and obstinacy of the Greeks. “Had that angel appeared,“ exclaims
the historian, “had he offered to exterminate your foes if you would
consent to the union of the church, even event then, in that fatal
moment, you would have rejected your safety, or have deceived your God.“

effect of his description, speaks of the “sweet morning sleep resting on
the eyes of youths and maidens,“ p. 288.</p></li>

and entered the dome; and such was his jealous regard for that monument
of his glory, that on observing a zealous Mussulman in the act of
breaking the marble pavement, he admonished him with his cimeter, that,
if the spoil and captives were granted to the soldiers, the public and
private buildings had been reserved for the prince. By his command the
metropolis of the Eastern church was transformed into a mosque: the rich
and portable instruments of superstition had been removed; the crosses
were thrown down; and the walls, which were covered with images and
mosaics, were washed and purified, and restored to a state of naked
simplicity. On the same day, or on the ensuing Friday, the muezin, or
crier, ascended the most lofty turret, and proclaimed the ezan, or
public invitation in the name of God and his prophet; the imam preached;
and Mahomet and Second performed the namaz of prayer and thanksgiving on
the great altar, where the Christian mysteries had so lately been
celebrated before the last of the Caesars. ^76 From St. Sophia he
proceeded to the august, but desolate mansion of a hundred successors of
the great Constantine, but which in a few hours had been stripped of the
pomp of royalty. A melancholy reflection on the vicissitudes of human

<li><p>From this misery he was relieved by the sense of merit or the
smile of favor; and the employment of apostolic notary afforded him a
daily stipend of five gold florins, a more honorable and extensive
connection, and the right of contrasting, both in words and actions, his
own integrity with the vices of the state. The eloquence of Rienzi was
prompt and persuasive: the multitude is always prone to envy and
censure: he was stimulated by the loss of a brother and the impunity of
the assassins; nor was it possible to excuse or exaggerate the public
calamities. The blessings of peace and justice, for which civil society
has been instituted, were banished from Rome: the jealous citizens, who
might have endured every personal or pecuniary injury, were most deeply
wounded in the dishonor of their wives and daughters: ^22 they were
equally oppressed by the arrogance of the nobles and the corruption of
the magistrates; ^!! and the abuse of arms or of laws was the only
circumstance that distinguished the lions from the dogs and serpents of
the Capitol. These allegorical emblems were variously repeated in the
pictures which Rienzi exhibited in the streets and churches; and while
the spectators gazed with curious wonder, the bold and ready orator
unfolded the meaning, applied the satire, inflamed their passions, and
announced a distant hope of comfort and deliverance. The privileges of
Rome, her eternal sovereignty over her princes and provinces, was the
theme of his public and private discourse; and a monument of servitude
became in his hands a title and incentive of liberty. The decree of the
senate, which granted the most ample prerogatives to the emperor
Vespasian, had been inscribed on a copper plate still extant in the
choir of the church of St. John Lateran. ^23 A numerous assembly of
nobles and plebeians was invited to this political lecture, and a
convenient theatre was erected for their reception. The notary appeared
in a magnificent and mysterious habit, explained the inscription by a
version and commentary, ^24 and descanted with eloquence and zeal on the
ancient glories of the senate and people, from whom all legal authority
was derived. The supine ignorance of the nobles was incapable of
discerning the serious tendency of such representations: they might
sometimes chastise with words and blows the plebeian reformer; but he
was often suffered in the Colonna palace to amuse the company with his
threats and predictions; and the modern Brutus ^25 was concealed under
the mask of folly and the character of a buffoon. While they indulged
their contempt, the restoration of the good estate, his favorite
expression, was entertained among the people as a desirable, a possible,
and at length as an approaching, event; and while all had the
disposition to applaud, some had the courage to assist, their promised
deliverer.</p></li>
<li><p>: Sir J. Hobhouse published (in his Illustrations of Childe
Harold) Rienzi’s joyful letter to the people of Rome on the apparently
favorable termination of this mission. - M. 1845.]</p></li>
<li><p>the protection of the commons was the essence of that sacred
office; and they were ignorant, that it had never been invested with any
share in the legislative or executive powers of the republic. In this
character, and with the consent of the Roman, the tribune enacted the
most salutary laws for the restoration and maintenance of the good
estate. By the first he fulfils the wish of honesty and inexperience,
that no civil suit should be protracted beyond the term of fifteen days.
The danger of frequent perjury might justify the pronouncing against a
false accuser the same penalty which his evidence would have inflicted:
the disorders of the times might compel the legislator to punish every
homicide with death, and every injury with equal retaliation. But the
execution of justice was hopeless till he had previously abolished the
tyranny of the nobles. It was formally provided, that none, except the
supreme magistrate, should possess or command the gates, bridges, or
towers of the state; that no private garrisons should be introduced into
the towns or castles of the Roman territory; that none should bear arms,
or presume to fortify their houses in the city or country; that the
barons should be responsible for the safety of the highways, and the
free passage of provisions; and that the protection of malefactors and
robbers should be expiated by a fine of a thousand marks of silver. But
these regulations would have been impotent and nugatory, had not the
licentious nobles been awed by the sword of the civil power. A sudden
alarm from the bell of the Capitol could still summon to the standard
above twenty thousand volunteers: the support of the tribune and the
laws required a more regular and permanent force. In each harbor of the
coast a vessel was stationed for the assurance of commerce; a standing
militia of three hundred and sixty horse and thirteen hundred foot was
levied, clothed, and paid in the thirteen quarters of the city: and the
spirit of a commonwealth may be traced in the grateful allowance of one
hundred florins, or pounds, to the heirs of every soldier who lost his
life in the service of his country. For the maintenance of the public
defence, for the establishment of granaries, for the relief of widows,
orphans, and indigent convents, Rienzi applied, without fear of
sacrilege, the revenues of the apostolic chamber: the three branches of
hearth-money, the salt-duty, and the customs, were each of the annual
produce of one hundred thousand florins; ^26 and scandalous were the
abuses, if in four or five months the amount of the salt-duty could be
trebled by his judicious economy. After thus restoring the forces and
finances of the republic, the tribune recalled the nobles from their
solitary independence; required their personal appearance in the
Capitol; and imposed an oath of allegiance to the new government, and of
submission to the laws of the good estate. Apprehensive for their
safety, but still more apprehensive of the danger of a refusal, the
princes and barons returned to their houses at Rome in the garb of
simple and peaceful citizens: the Colonna and Ursini, the Savelli and
Frangipani, were confounded before the tribunal of a plebeian, of the
vile buffoon whom they had so often derided, and their disgrace was
aggravated by the indignation which they vainly struggled to disguise.
The same oath was successively pronounced by the several orders of
society, the clergy and gentlemen, the judges and notaries, the
merchants and artisans, and the gradual descent was marked by the
increase of sincerity and zeal. They swore to live and die with the
republic and the church, whose interest was artfully united by the
nominal association of the bishop of Orvieto, the pope’s vicar, to the
office of tribune. It was the boast of Rienzi, that he had delivered the
throne and patrimony of St. Peter from a rebellious aristocracy; and
Clement the Sixth, who rejoiced in its fall, affected to believe the
professions, to applaud the merits, and to confirm the title, of his
trusty servant. The speech, perhaps the mind, of the tribune, was
inspired with a lively regard for the purity of the faith: he insinuated
his claim to a supernatural mission from the Holy Ghost; enforced by a
heavy forfeiture the annual duty of confession and communion; and
strictly guarded the spiritual as well as temporal welfare of his
faithful people. ^27</p></li>

<li><p>Petrarch had been the private friend, perhaps the secret
counsellor, of Rienzi: his writings breathe the most ardent spirit of
patriotism and joy; and all respect for the pope, all gratitude for the
Colonna, was lost in the superior duties of a Roman citizen. The
poet-laureate of the Capitol maintains the act, applauds the hero, and
mingles with some apprehension and advice, the most lofty hopes of the
permanent and rising greatness of the republic. ^32</p></li>
<li><p>: In his letter to the archbishop of Prague, Rienzi thus
describes the effect of his elevation on Italy and on the world: “Did I
not restore real peace among the cities which were distracted by
factions? did I not cause all the citizens, exiled by party violence,
with their wretched wives and children, to be readmitted? had I not
begun to extinguish the factious names (scismatica nomina) of Guelf and
Ghibelline, for which countless thousands had perished body and soul,
under the eyes of their pastors, by the reduction of the city of Rome
and all Italy into one amicable, peaceful, holy, and united confederacy?
the consecrated standards and banners having been by me collected and
blended together, and, in witness to our holy association and perfect
union, offered up in the presence of the ambassadors of all the cities
of Italy, on the day of the assumption of our Blessed Lady.“ p. xlvii.
In the Libellus ad Caesarem: “I received the homage and submission of
all the sovereigns of Apulia, the barons and counts, and almost all the
people of Italy. I was honored by solemn embassies and letters by the
emperor of Constantinople and the king of England. The queen of Naples
submitted herself and her kingdom to the protection of the tribune. The
king of Hungary, by two solemn embassies, brought his cause against his
queen and his nobles before my tribunal; and I venture to say further,
that the fame of the tribune alarmed the soldan of Babylon. When the
Christian pilgrims to the sepulchre of our Lord related to the Christian
and Jewish inhabitants of Jerusalem all the yet unheard-of and wonderful
circumstances of the reformation in Rome, both Jews and Christians
celebrated the event with unusual festivities. When the soldan inquired
the cause of these rejoicings, and received this intelligence about
Rome, he ordered all the havens and cities on the coast to be fortified,
and put in a state of defence,“ p. xxxv. - M. 1845.]</p></li>
<li><p>He might have learned, that the ancient tribunes, so strong and
sacred in the public opinion, were not distinguished in style, habit, or
appearance, from an ordinary plebeian; ^33 and that as often as they
visited the city on foot, a single viator, or meadle, attended the
exercise of their office. The Gracchi would have frowned or smiled,
could they have read the sonorous titles and epithets of their
successor, “Nicholas, severe and merciful; deliverer of Rome; defender
of Italy; ^34 friend of mankind, and of liberty, peace, and justice;
tribune august:“ his theatrical pageants had prepared the revolution;
but Rienzi abused, in luxury and pride, the political maxim of speaking
to the eyes, as well as the understanding, of the multitude. From nature
he had received the gift of a handsome person, ^35 till it was swelled
and disfigured by intemperance: and his propensity to laughter was
corrected in the magistrate by the affectation of gravity and sternness.
He was clothed, at least on public occasions, in a party-colored robe of
velvet or satin, lined with fur, and embroidered with gold: the rod of
justice, which he carried in his hand, was a sceptre of polished steel,
crowned with a globe and cross of gold, and enclosing a small fragment
of the true and holy wood. In his civil and religious processions
through the city, he rode on a white steed, the symbol of royalty: the
great banner of the republic, a sun with a circle of stars, a dove with
an olive branch, was displayed over his head; a shower of gold and
silver was scattered among the populace, fifty guards with halberds
encompassed his person; a troop of horse preceded his march; and their
tymbals and trumpets were of massy silver.</p></li>
<li><p>: An illustrious female writer has drawn, with a single stroke,
the character of Rienzi, Crescentius, and Arnold of Brescia, the fond
restorers of Roman liberty: ‘Qui ont pris les souvenirs pour les
esperances.’ Corinne, tom. i. p. 159. Could Tacitus have excelled this?“
Hallam, vol i p. 418. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>These extraordinary spectacles might deceive or flatter the
people; and their own vanity was gratified in the vanity of their
leader. But in his private life he soon deviated from the strict rule of
frugality and abstinence; and the plebeians, who were awed by the
splendor of the nobles, were provoked by the luxury of their equal. His
wife, his son, his uncle, (a barber in name and profession,) exposed the
contrast of vulgar manners and princely expense; and without acquiring
the majesty, Rienzi degenerated into the vices, of a king.</p></li>
<li><p>: It was on this occasion that he made the profane comparison
between himself and our Lord; and the striking circumstance took place
which he relates in his letter to the archbishop of Prague. In the midst
of all the wild and joyous exultation of the people, one of his most
zealous supporters, a monk, who was in high repute for his sanctity,
stood apart in a corner of the church and wept bitterly! A domestic
chaplain of Rienzi’s inquired the cause of his grief. “Now,“ replied the
man of God, “is thy master cast down from heaven - never saw I man so
proud. By the aid of the Holy Ghost he has driven the tyrants from the
city without drawing a sword; the cities and the sovereigns of Italy
have submitted to his power. Why is he so arrogant and ungrateful
towards the Most High? Why does he seek earthly and transitory rewards
for his labors, and in his wanton speech liken himself to the Creator?
Tell thy master that he can only atone for this offence by tears of
penitence.“ In the evening the chaplain communicated this solemn rebuke
to the tribune: it appalled him for the time, but was soon forgotten in
the tumult and hurry of business. - M. 1845.]</p></li>

<li><p>two of his servants, the learned Poggius ^1 and a friend,
ascended the Capitoline hill; reposed themselves among the ruins of
columns and temples; and viewed from that commanding spot the wide and
various prospect of desolation. ^2 The place and the object gave ample
scope for moralizing on the vicissitudes of fortune, which spares
neither man nor the proudest of his works, which buries empires and
cities in a common grave; and it was agreed, that in proportion to her
former greatness, the fall of Rome was the more awful and deplorable.
“Her primeval state, such as she might appear in a remote age, when
Evander entertained the stranger of Troy, ^3 has been delineated by the
fancy of Virgil. This Tarpeian rock was then a savage and solitary
thicket: in the time of the poet, it was crowned with the golden roofs
of a temple; the temple is overthrown, the gold has been pillaged, the
wheel of fortune has accomplished her revolution, and the sacred ground
is again disfigured with thorns and brambles. The hill of the Capitol,
on which we sit, was formerly the head of the Roman empire, the citadel
of the earth, the terror of kings; illustrated by the footsteps of so
many triumphs, enriched with the spoils and tributes of so many nations.
This spectacle of the world, how is it fallen! how changed! how defaced!
The path of victory is obliterated by vines, and the benches of the
senators are concealed by a dunghill. Cast your eyes on the Palatine
hill, and seek among the shapeless and enormous fragments the marble
theatre, the obelisks, the colossal statues, the porticos of Nero’s
palace: survey the other hills of the city, the vacant space is
interrupted only by ruins and gardens. The forum of the Roman people,
where they assembled to enact their laws and elect their magistrates, is
now enclosed for the cultivation of pot-herbs, or thrown open for the
reception of swine and buffaloes. The public and private edifices, that
were founded for eternity, lie prostrate, naked, and broken, like the
limbs of a mighty giant; and the ruin is the more visible, from the
stupendous relics that have survived the injuries of time and fortune.“

<li>After the wonder of the Coliseum, Poggius might have overlooked
small amphitheatre of brick, most probably for the use of the praetorian
camp: the theatres of Marcellus and Pompey were occupied in a great
measure by public and private buildings; and in the Circus, Agonalis and
Maximus, little more than the situation and the form could be
investigated. 6. The columns of Trajan and Antonine were still erect;
but the Egyptian obelisks were broken or buried. A people of gods and
heroes, the workmanship of art, was reduced to one equestrian figure of
gilt brass, and to five marble statues, of which the most conspicuous
were the two horses of Phidias and Praxiteles. 7. The two mausoleums or
sepulchres of Augustus and Hadrian could not totally be lost: but the
former was only visible as a mound of earth; and the latter, the castle
of St. Angelo, had acquired the name and appearance of a modern
fortress. With the addition of some separate and nameless columns, such
were the remains of the ancient city; for the marks of a more recent
structure might be detected in the walls, which formed a circumference
of ten miles, included three hundred and seventy-nine turrets, and
opened into the country by thirteen gates.</li>

says be “might have overlooked.“ - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>: The popes, under the dominion of the emperor and of the
exarcha, according to Feas’s just observation, did not possess the power
of disposing of the buildings and monuments of the city according to
their own will. Bunsen and Platner, vol. i. p. 241. - M.]</p></li>
<li><p>Since the arrival of Poggius, the temple of Concord, ^35 and many
capital structures, had vanished from his eyes; and an epigram of the
same age expresses a just and pious fear, that the continuance of this
practice would finally annihilate all the monuments of antiquity. ^36
The smallness of their numbers was the sole check on the demands and
depredations of the Romans. The imagination of Petrarch might create the
presence of a mighty people; ^37 and I hesitate to believe, that, even
in the fourteenth century, they could be reduced to a contemptible list
of thirty-three thousand inhabitants. From that period to the reign of
Leo the Tenth, if they multiplied to the amount of eighty-five thousand,
^38 the increase of citizens was in some degree pernicious to the
ancient city.</p></li>
<li><p>: From the quotations in Bunsen’s Dissertation, it may be
suspected that this slow but continual process of destruction was the
most fatal. - M]</p></li>
<li><p>the theatres of Pompey and Marcellus were occupied by the Savelli
and Ursini families; ^44 and the rough fortress has been gradually
softened to the splendor and elegance of an Italian palace. Even the
churches were encompassed with arms and bulwarks, and the military
engines on the roof of St. Peter’s were the terror of the Vatican and
the scandal of the Christian world. Whatever is fortified will be
attacked; and whatever is attacked may be destroyed. Could the Romans
have wrested from the popes the castle of St. Angelo, they had resolved
by a public decree to annihilate that monument of servitude. Every
building of defence was exposed to a siege; and in every siege the arts
and engines of destruction were laboriously employed. After the death of
Nicholas the Fourth, Rome, without a sovereign or a senate, was
abandoned six months to the fury of civil war. “The houses,“ says a
cardinal and poet of the times, ^45 “were crushed by the weight and
velocity of enormous stones; ^46 the walls were perforated by the
strokes of the battering-ram; the towers were involved in fire and
smoke; and the assailants were stimulated by rapine and revenge.“ The
work was consummated by the tyranny of the laws; and the factions of
Italy alternately exercised a blind and thoughtless vengeance on their
adversaries, whose houses and castles they razed to the ground. ^47 In
comparing the days of foreign, with the ages of domestic, hostility, we
must pronounce, that the latter have been far more ruinous to the city;
and our opinion is confirmed by the evidence of Petrarch. “Behold,“ says
the laureate, “the relics of Rome, the image of her pristine greatness!
neither time nor the Barbarian can boast the merit of this stupendous
destruction: it was perpetrated by her own citizens, by the most
illustrious of her sons; and your ancestors (he writes to a noble
Annabaldi) have done with the battering-ram what the Punic hero could
not accomplish with the sword.“ ^48 The influence of the two last
principles of decay must in some degree be multiplied by each other;
since the houses and towers, which were subverted by civil war, required
by a new and perpetual supply from the monuments of antiquity.
