<h4 id="information-and-the-future-of-the-city">Information and the
Future of the City</h4>
<p>In twenty years Japanese office workers may still commute, packed</p>
<p>shoulder to shoulder, to downtown towers. But no one else in the</p>
<p>developed world will. Office work, rather than office workers, will
do</p>
<p>he traveling. Tomorrow’s big city is no longer going to be the
office</p>
<p>center.</p>
<p>The exodus is already under way. Citibank handles credit cards in</p>
<p>North Dakota, clears checks in upstate New York and Delaware, and
is</p>
<p>moving data processing across the Hudson to suburban New Jersey.
A</p>
<p>large Boston-based mutual-fund group, Colonial Management Associ-</p>
<p>ates, has moved nationwide customer service and customer
accounting</p>
<p>o a Denver suburb. Insurance companies are rapidly shifting their</p>
<p>labor-intensive work–claims handling, customer correspondence,</p>
<p>record keeping-to the outskirts of metropolitan areas. And office</p>
<p>parks especially built for back-office operations are now springing
up</p>
<p>in the suburbs as fast as shopping malls sprang up there in the
1960s</p>
<p>and 1970s.</p>
<p>Acquiring Wheels</p>
<p>The modern big city is the creation of the nineteenth century’s</p>
<p>ability to move people. Everyone in Dickens’s London walked to
work</p>
<p>except the owners, who lived over their shops or their
countinghouses.</p>
<p>But then, beginning in mid-century, people began to acquire
wheels-</p>
<p>First published in the Wall Street Journal, 1989.</p>
<p>he railroad first, then the omnibus and the streetcar (horse-drawn,
of</p>
<p>course, for many decades), the subway and the elevated train, the</p>
<p>automobile, the bicycle. Suddenly large masses of people could
move</p>
<p>over great distances to where the work was. And the elevator
added</p>
<p>vertical mobility. It was this ability to move people that, more
than</p>
<p>anything else, made possible large organizations, businesses,
hospi-</p>
<p>als, government agencies, and universities.</p>
<p>By 1914, every single one of the means to move people into an</p>
<p>office-centered large city-and to enable the office workers to
live</p>
<p>outside it-had been developed. But they did not have their full
impact</p>
<p>until after World War 11. Until then only two cities had
skyscrapers-</p>
<p>New York and Chicago. Now every mid-sized city worldwide boasts a</p>
<p>“skyline.“ And even in mid-sized cities people commute.</p>
<p>This trend has clearly reached its end, has indeed widely
overshot</p>
<p>he mark. Tokyo’s office workers have to live more than two hours</p>
<p>away just to get a seat on the morning train. In Los Angeles, traffic
at</p>
<p>six every weekday morning is bumper to bumper in all directions-</p>
<p>people trying to get to their desks by 8:30 or 9. Things are not
much</p>
<p>better in Boston or New York or Philadelphia. London’s Piccadilly</p>
<p>Circus is chaos twenty-four hours a day, and so are those marvels
of</p>
<p>nineteenth-century city planning, the Grands Boulevards of Paris.</p>
<p>Rome and Madrid are worse still.</p>
<p>Office workers in the world’s big cities do not have eight-hour
days;</p>
<p>hey have twelve-hour days. And all attempts in the past thirty years
to</p>
<p>relieve the traffic jams and their frustrations through new public
transit</p>
<p>have been total failures despite countless billions spent on
them.</p>
<p>Yet none of this is necessary any more; indeed, commuting to
office</p>
<p>work is obsolete. It is now infinitely easier, cheaper and faster to
do</p>
<p>what the nineteenth century could not do: move information, and
with</p>
<p>it office work, to where the people are. The tools to do so are
already</p>
<p>here: the telephone, two-way video, electronic mail, the fax
machine,</p>
<p>he personal computer, the modem, and so on. And so is the recep-</p>
<p>ivity: witness, for example, the boom in fax machines in the past</p>
<p>eighteen months.</p>
<p>We already know how office work will be done in the future.</p>
<p>Contrary to what futurists predicted twenty-five years ago, the trend
is</p>
<p>not toward individuals working in their homes. People greatly prefer
to</p>
<p>work where other people are. But even in Japan-where the need for</p>
<p>Information and the Future of the City 341</p>
<p>community and companionship at work is greater than in the West-</p>
<p>he exodus of such clerical work as data processing from downtown</p>
<p>has begun.</p>
<p>But, equally important, clerical work increasingly will become
“un-</p>
<p>coupled,“ the way much physical office work–cleaning, maintaining</p>
<p>equipment, running the cafeteria-already has been. Rather than
being</p>
<p>employees of the institution whose office work they do, more and
more</p>
<p>clerical workers will be employed by specialized and independent</p>
<p>contractors. A growing amount of such work already is being done
by</p>
<p>people hired, trained, placed, and paid by temporary-help
firms-with</p>
<p>more and more of the “temporaries“ actually holding down
full-time,</p>
<p>permanent assignments in the client companies. A good many of the</p>
<p>new type of office parks provide a trained clerical force and the</p>
<p>supervision for it. They provide office work rather than office
space.</p>
<p>And, according to some reports, that is where the demand is.</p>
<p>Office workers doing clerical and maintenance work are the
largest</p>
<p>single work group in the developed world’s big cities-accounting
for</p>
<p>as much as half the working population. What, then, will the city
of</p>
<p>omorrow look like when it is no longer an “office city“? It will,
one</p>
<p>can safely say, be a “headquarters city.“</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago a number of large U. S. companies–General</p>
<p>Foods, IBM, General Electric-moved out of Manhattan and into</p>
<p>suburbia, lock, stock, and barrel. At that time we did not know that
we</p>
<p>could move information. Thus, to free office workers from the need
to</p>
<p>commute, companies isolated top management people and profession-</p>
<p>als and imposed on them constant traveling into the city for
business</p>
<p>meetings.</p>
<p>Big companies tomorrow are almost certain to keep their manage-</p>
<p>ment people-at least their senior ones-where other senior manage-</p>
<p>ment people are: in the city. And so will government agencies and</p>
<p>other large organizations. But this means that the big city will
also</p>
<p>house the purveyors of specialized skills and knowledge-the
lawyer,</p>
<p>he accounting firm, the architect, the consultant, the
advertising</p>
<p>agency, the investment banker, the financial analyst, and so on.
But</p>
<p>even these people will have their office work done outside the
city.</p>
<p>A very big law firm is completing plans to have only one law</p>
<p>library, in one suburban location. It will serve all 10 of its
offices in the</p>
<p>U.S. and overseas through a computer network supplemented by fax</p>
<p>machines and two-way video. Within two or three years the firm
ex-</p>
<p>pects to vacate all the space now occupied by the current 10
libraries-</p>
<p>wo floors each in every location.</p>
<p>We may be at the very end of the tremendous boom in office</p>
<p>construction and office rents that was triggered when Napoleon
I11</p>
<p>created the modern city’s prototype in 1860 Paris and which has</p>
<p>reached such a frenzy in all major Free World cities these past
twenty</p>
<p>years. (I, for one, am perfectly reconciled to the Japanese buying
up</p>
<p>more and more of the large office buildings in downtown America.)</p>
<p>The big city of tomorrow is far more likely to resemble the
prein-</p>
<p>dustrial city than the nineteenth-century city that still shapes
today’s</p>
<p>New York or Paris.</p>
<p>But will even those who work in the urban headquarters live in
the</p>
<p>cities? Where will the largest number of them-managers and
profes-</p>
<p>sionals in particular-make their homes?</p>
<p>In continental Europe, where middle managers and professionals</p>
<p>still tend to live in the city, the shift from office city to
headquarters</p>
<p>city may well prevent their moving out. But it is doubtful that
the</p>
<p>exodus to the suburbs will be reversed or even greatly slowed in
the</p>
<p>United States, in Britain, or in Japan, where middle-class people
with</p>
<p>children have already moved out of the core cities. And surely
the</p>
<p>headquarters city will have even less work for the poor and
unskilled</p>
<p>han the office city has. This will be a particular problem in the
United</p>
<p>States, where welfare payments have drawn so many of the least-</p>
<p>skilled and least-schooled into the inner-city jungle.</p>
<p>What will the tax base of the headquarters city be, and can it
remain</p>
<p>a commercial center? Luxury shops do not depend on the office</p>
<p>worker. But most other shops in the city do, especially
department</p>
<p>stores, and only in Japan do people not working in the city
regularly</p>
<p>come in to shop there. What about restaurants and hotels? Will
theaters</p>
<p>and opera houses become transmitters of shows through videotape
and</p>
<p>cable TV rather than places people go to? Will the big-city
hospital</p>
<p>become a center of teaching, of information, and of diagnosis for
the</p>
<p>suburban and exurban hospitals where the patients will be?</p>
<p>A Lecture to 10,000</p>
<p>And what about the large university? The costs of higher
education</p>
<p>in all developed countries are nearly as much out of control as the
costs</p>
<p>Information and the Future of the City 343</p>
<p>of health care. The only way, perhaps, to cap them may be to
convert</p>
<p>he university into a place form which learning flows to where the</p>
<p>students are-something already done by the successful Open
Univer-</p>
<p>sity in Britain.</p>
<p>Several times a year I lecture to 10,000 or more students, yet
fewer</p>
<p>han 100 are in the room with me. The rest see me via satellite in
more</p>
<p>han 100 “downlinks“ and discuss their questions with me via tele-</p>
<p>phone.</p>
<p>There is a great deal said and written these days about the
technolog-</p>
<p>ical impacts of information. But perhaps its social impacts are
greater</p>
<p>still, and more important.</p>
