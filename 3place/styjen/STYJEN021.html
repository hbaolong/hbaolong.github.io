<h4 id="the-new-productivity-challenge">The New Productivity
Challenge</h4>
<p>The productivity of the newly dominant groups in the work force,</p>
<p>knowledge workers and service workers, will be the biggest and</p>
<p>oughest challenge facing managers in the developed countries for</p>
<p>decades to come. And serious work on this daunting task has only</p>
<p>begun.</p>
<p>Productivity in making and moving things-in manufacturing,</p>
<p>farming, mining, construction, and transportation-has increased at
an</p>
<p>annual rate of 3 to 4 percent compound for the last 125 years-for
a</p>
<p>45-fold expansion in overall productivity in the developed
countries.</p>
<p>On this productivity explosion rests all the increases in these
countries</p>
<p>in both the standard of living and the quality of life. It provided
the</p>
<p>vast increase in disposable incomes and purchasing power. But be-</p>
<p>ween a third and a half of its fruits were taken in the form of
leisure-</p>
<p>something known only to aristocrats or to the idle rich before
1914,</p>
<p>when everybody else worked at least 3,000 hours a year. (Now even</p>
<p>he Japanese work no more than 2,000 hours a year, Americans
around</p>
<p>1,800, West Germans 1,650.) The productivity explosion also paid
for</p>
<p>he ten-fold expansion of education and for the even greater
expansion</p>
<p>of health care. Productivity has become the “wealth of nations.“</p>
<p>Rising productivity was something so totally unprecedented that</p>
<p>here was no term for it in any language. For Karl Marx-as for all</p>
<p>nineteenth-century economists-it was axiomatic that worker output</p>
<p>could be increased only by working harder or longer-all of Marx
is</p>
<p>First published in The Harvard Business Review, 1991.</p>
<p>based on this belief. But though Frederic Winslow Taylor
(18561915)</p>
<p>disproved the axiom by starting to work on productivity in the
early</p>
<p>1880s-his first substantial results came in 1883, the very year
Marx</p>
<p>died-he himself never knew the term. It did not come into general
use</p>
<p>until World War 11-and then at first only in the United States.
The</p>
<p>1950 edition of the most authoritative English dictionary, the
Concise</p>
<p>Oxford, did not yet list productivity in its present meaning. By now
it</p>
<p>is commonplace that production is the true competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The productivity explosion was arguably the most important social</p>
<p>event of the past hundred years, and one that had no precedent in</p>
<p>history. There have always been rich people and poor people. But
as</p>
<p>recently as 1850 the poor in China were not measurably worse off
than</p>
<p>hose in the slums of London or Glasgow. And the average income in</p>
<p>he richest country of 1910 was at most three times the average
income</p>
<p>of the then poorest countries-now it is twenty to forty times as
large,</p>
<p>even without counting leisure, education, or health care. Before
the</p>
<p>productivity explosion it took at least fifty years for a country to
be-</p>
<p>come “developed.“ South Korea-as late as 1955 one of the world’s</p>
<p>ruly “backward“ countries–did it in twenty years. This radical</p>
<p>reversal of what has been the norm since time immemorial is in
its</p>
<p>entirety the result of the productivity revolution that started in
the</p>
<p>United States around 1870 or 1880.</p>
<p>Productivity in making and moving things is still going up at the</p>
<p>same annual rate. It is going up–contrary to popular belief-fully
as</p>
<p>much in the United States as in Japan or West Germany. Indeed,
the</p>
<p>current productivity increase in U.S. f a r m i n g 4 G to 5 percent
a</p>
<p>year-is far and away the biggest increase recorded anywhere at
any</p>
<p>ime. And the U.S. productivity increase in manufacturing during
the</p>
<p>1980s-3.9 percent a year-was in absolute terms actually larger
than</p>
<p>he corresponding annual increase in Japanese and German manufac-</p>
<p>uring, for the U.S. base is still quite a bit higher.</p>
<p>But in the developed countries the productivity revolution is
over.</p>
<p>There are simply not enough people employed making and moving</p>
<p>hings for their productivity to be decisive. They now account for
no</p>
<p>more than a fifth of the work force in a developed economy–only</p>
<p>hirty years ago they were still a near-majority. And the productivity
of</p>
<p>he people who do make the difference-knowledge workers and</p>
<p>The New Productivity Challenge 217</p>
<p>service workers-is not going up. In some areas it is actually
going</p>
<p>down. Salespeople in the department stores of all developed
countries</p>
<p>now sell, adjusted for inflation, no more than two thirds of what
they</p>
<p>sold in 1929. And few people would argue, I submit, that the
teacher</p>
<p>of 1991 is more productive than the teacher of 1901.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers and service workers range from research scien-</p>
<p>ist and cardiac surgeon through draftsman and store manager to</p>
<p>sixteen-year-olds who work as car hops in the fast-food drive-in for
a</p>
<p>few Saturday afternoon hours. They even include large numbers of</p>
<p>people who actually work as machine operators-washing dishes in a</p>
<p>restaurant, polishing floors in a hospital, pushing computer keys in
a</p>
<p>claims-settling department of a insurance company. Yet knowledge</p>
<p>workers and service workers, for all their diversity, are
remarkably</p>
<p>alike in what does not work in raising productivity. But there are
also</p>
<p>important similarities in what does work for these workers, no
matter</p>
<p>how much they might otherwise differ in knowledge, skill respon-</p>
<p>sibility, social status, and pay.</p>
<p>The first thing we have learned-and it came as a rude shock-is</p>
<p>hat capital cannot be substituted for labor (i.e., for people) in
knowl-</p>
<p>edge and service work. Nor does new technology by itself generate</p>
<p>higher productivity in such work. In making and moving things,</p>
<p>capital and technology are factors of production, to use the
econo-</p>
<p>mist’s term. In knowledge and service work, they are tools of
produc-</p>
<p>ion. Whether they help productivity or harm it depends on what</p>
<p>people do with them, on the purpose to which they are being put,
for</p>
<p>instance, or on the skill of the user. Thirty years ago we were sure
that</p>
<p>he computer would result in a massive reduction in clerical and
office</p>
<p>forces. The investment in data-processing equipment now rivals that
in</p>
<p>materials-processing technology-that is, in conventional
machinery</p>
<p>-with the great bulk of it in services. Yet office and clerical
forces</p>
<p>have grown at a much faster rate since the introduction of
information</p>
<p>echnology than ever before. And there has been virtually no
increase</p>
<p>in the productivity of service work.</p>
<p>The most telling example are hospitals. When I first began to
work</p>
<p>with them-in the late 1940s-they were entirely labor-intensive,
with</p>
<p>little capital investment except in bricks, mortar, and beds. A
good</p>
<p>many perfectly respectable hospitals then had not yet invested in</p>
<p>available and fairly old technologies; they had neither X-ray
depart-</p>
<p>ment nor clinical laboratory nor physical therapy. Today’s
hospitals</p>
<p>are the most capital-intensive facilities around, with enormous
sums</p>
<p>invested in ultra sound, body scanners, nuclear magnetic imagers,</p>
<p>blood and tissue analyzers, clean rooms, and a dozen more new</p>
<p>echnologies. Each of these brought with it the need for additional
and</p>
<p>expensive people without reducing by a single person the
hospital’s</p>
<p>existing staff. In fact, the world-wide escalation of health-care
costs is</p>
<p>he result, in large measure, of the hospital’s having become an</p>
<p>economic monstrosity. Being both highly labor-intensive and
highly</p>
<p>capital-intensive, it is, by any economist’s definition, simply
not</p>
<p>viable economically. But the hospital has at least significantly
in-</p>
<p>creased its performance capacity. In other areas of knowledge or</p>
<p>service work there are only higher costs, more investment, and
more</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>Only massive increases in hospital productivity can stem the
health-</p>
<p>care cost explosion. And these increases can only come from
“Work-</p>
<p>ing Smarter. “</p>
<p>Neither economist nor technologist gives star billing to Working</p>
<p>Smarter as the key to the productivity explosion; the former
features</p>
<p>capital investment, the latter, technology. But Working Smarter,</p>
<p>whether called scientific management, industrial engineering,
human</p>
<p>relations, eficiency engineering, or task study (the modest term
Fred-</p>
<p>eric W. Taylor himself favored)-has been the main force behind
the</p>
<p>productivity explosion. Capital investment and technology were just
as</p>
<p>copious in the then developed countries in the first hundred years of
the</p>
<p>Industrial Revolution-that is, in the century before Taylor-as
they</p>
<p>have been in the century since. But only when Working Smarter
began</p>
<p>o have an impact did productivity in making and moving things
take</p>
<p>off on its meteoric rise. Still, in making and moving things
Working</p>
<p>Smarter is but one key to increased productivity. In knowledge
and</p>
<p>service work it is the key.</p>
<p>Working Smarter means, however, very different things in knowl-</p>
<p>edge and service work from what it means in making and moving</p>
<p>hings.</p>
<p>The New Productivity Challenge 219</p>
<p>When Frederic Taylor started what later became Scientific Manage-</p>
<p>ment by studying the shoveling of sand, it never occurred to him
to</p>
<p>ask: “What is the task? Why do it?“ All he asked was “How is it</p>
<p>done?“ Almost fifty years later, Harvard’s Elton Mayo (188CL1949)</p>
<p>set out to demolish Scientific Management and to replace it with
what</p>
<p>later came to be called Human Relations. But, like Taylor, he
never</p>
<p>asked, “What is the task? Why do it?“ In his famous experiments
at</p>
<p>he Hawthorne Works of Western Electric, he only asked, “How can</p>
<p>wiring telephone equipment best be done?“ In making and moving</p>
<p>hings the task is always taken for granted.</p>
<p>But the first question in increasing productivity in knowledge
and</p>
<p>service work has to be: “What is the task? What do we try to
accom-</p>
<p>plish? Why do it at all? The easiest-but perhaps also the
greatest-</p>
<p>increases in productivity in such work come from redefining the
task,</p>
<p>and especially from eliminating what needs not be done.</p>
<p>The oldest example is still the best one-mail-order processing at</p>
<p>he early Sears, Roebuck. Between 1906 and 1908 Sears eliminated</p>
<p>he time-consuming counting of money in incoming mail orders. In</p>
<p>hose days there was neither paper money nor checks but only
coins.</p>
<p>Hence, the money envelopes in the incoming order were weighed</p>
<p>automatically: if the weight tallied with the amount of the order
within</p>
<p>fairly narrow limits, the envelopes were not even opened.
Similarly,</p>
<p>Sears eliminated the even more time-consuming detailed recording
of</p>
<p>each incoming order. It scheduled order handling and shipping
accord-</p>
<p>ing to the weight of the incoming mail, assuming forty orders for
each</p>
<p>pound of mail. These two steps increased the productivity of the
entire</p>
<p>mail-order operation ten-fold within two years.’</p>
<p>A major insurance company has recently increased the productivity</p>
<p>of claims settlement about five-fold-from an average of fifteen
min-</p>
<p>utes to three minutes per claim-by eliminating detailed checking
for</p>
<p>all but claims for very large sums. Instead of verifying thirty
items-as</p>
<p>had always been done–only five are being checked now: whether the</p>
<p>policy is still in force; matching its face amount with the amount
of</p>
<p>he claim; matching the name of the policy holder with the name on
the</p>
<p>death certificate; matching the name of the beneficiary on the
policy</p>
<p>with the name of the claimant. What led to this productivity
increase</p>
<p>was asking the question: “What is the task?“ And then the answer</p>
<p>came fairly easy: “It’s to pay death claims as cheaply and as fast
as</p>
<p>possible“-and all that is now needed to control the process is to
work</p>
<p>hrough a small sample, that is, through every fiftieth claim, the
tradi-</p>
<p>ional way.</p>
<p>A few hospitals have eliminated most of the laborious and
expensive</p>
<p>admissions process. They now admit all patients the way they used
to</p>
<p>admit emergency patients who are brought in unconscious or
bleeding</p>
<p>and unable to fill out lengthy forms. They asked, “What is the</p>
<p>ask?“-and the answer was to identify the patient’s name, sex,
age,</p>
<p>address, and how to bill. This information is found, however, on
the</p>
<p>insurance identification practically all patients carry.</p>
<p>Another example: a well-known private college has been able to
cut</p>
<p>its financial-aid staff from eleven full-time clerks to one or two
people</p>
<p>who work in financial aid for only a few weeks a year. Like other</p>
<p>institutions of its kind, the college admits qualified applicants
without</p>
<p>regard to their ability to pay, with the financial-aid office then
deter-</p>
<p>mining what tuition reduction an applicant can be given. This was</p>
<p>done-and in most colleges is still being done-by laboriously
work-</p>
<p>ing through a long and detailed form submitted by each applicant.
But</p>
<p>for ninety-five out of each 100 applicants financial aid is
actually</p>
<p>determined by very few factors. Being told the family income; the</p>
<p>value of the family home; what, if any, additional sources of
income</p>
<p>here are-for example, from a trust fund-and whether there are</p>
<p>siblings presently paying college tuition, the computer figures out
in a</p>
<p>few seconds how much financial aid will be offered. The two part-</p>
<p>imers are needed only to winnow out the five percent of unusual</p>
<p>cases-the applicant who is a star athlete or a National
Scholarship</p>
<p>winner-which are then easily dealt with by the dean and a small</p>
<p>faculty committee in a few afternoon hours.</p>
<p>These are all examples of service work. In knowledge work, how-</p>
<p>ever, defining the task and getting rid of what needs not be done
are</p>
<p>even more necessary and produce even greater results.</p>
<p>I know one significant example: the way a major multi-national</p>
<p>company redefined its strategic planning. For many years a
planning</p>
<p>staff of forty-five brilliant people carefully prepared “strategic
scenar-</p>
<p>ios“ down to minute details. It was first-class work, and
stimulating</p>
<p>reading, everybody admitted. But it had minimum operational
impact.</p>
<p>The New Productivity Challenge 221</p>
<p>A new CEO asked, “What is the task?“ His answer: “It isn’t to</p>
<p>predict the future. It is to give our businesses direction and goals
and</p>
<p>he strategy to attain these goals.“ It took four years of hard work
and</p>
<p>several false starts. But now the planning people-still about the
same</p>
<p>number-work through only three questions for each of the
company’s</p>
<p>businesses: What market standing does it need to maintain
leadership?</p>
<p>What innovative performance does it need to support the needed</p>
<p>market standing? What rate of return is the minimum needed to
earn</p>
<p>he cost of capital? And then the planning people together with
the</p>
<p>operating executives in each business work out broad strategy
guide-</p>
<p>lines to attain these goals under different assumptions regarding
eco-</p>
<p>nomic conditions. The results are far simpler and far less
pretentious</p>
<p>han the old-style plans were, and far less elegant. But they have</p>
<p>become the “flight plans“ that guide the company’s businesses and
its</p>
<p>senior executives.</p>
<p>Except for this company I have not heard, however, of any case</p>
<p>where the questions What is the task? and Why do it? have so far
been</p>
<p>asked in respect to knowledge work.</p>
<p>In making and moving things people do one task at a time.
Taylor’s</p>
<p>laborer shoveled sand; he did not also stoke the furnace. Mayo’s</p>
<p>wiring-room women soldered, they did not also test finished tele-</p>
<p>phones on the side. The Iowa farmer planting corn does not get off
his</p>
<p>ractor between rows to attend a meeting. Concentration is not un-</p>
<p>known in knowledge and service work. The surgeon does not take</p>
<p>elephone calls in the operating room; nor should the lawyer while
in</p>
<p>consultation with a client. But in organizing-and that’s where
most</p>
<p>knowledge and service people work-there is growing splintering.
The</p>
<p>people at the very top can sometimes concentrate themselves,
though</p>
<p>far too few even try. But the people who actually do most of the</p>
<p>knowledge and service work in organizations-engineer~,teachers,</p>
<p>salespeople, nurses, middle managers in general–carry a steadily</p>
<p>growing load of busy work, additional activities that contribute
little or</p>
<p>no value and that have little or nothing to do with what these people
are</p>
<p>qualified and paid for.</p>
<p>The worst case may be the nurse in the American hospital. We hear</p>
<p>a great deal about the shortage of nurses. But how could we
possibly</p>
<p>have one? The number of graduating nurses entering the profession
has</p>
<p>gone up steadily for a good many years. At the same time the
number</p>
<p>of bed patients has been going down sharply. The explanation of
the</p>
<p>paradox: nurses now spend only half their time doing what they
have</p>
<p>learned and are being paid for-that is, nursing. The other half of
their</p>
<p>shift is taken by activities that do not require the nurse’s skill
and</p>
<p>knowledge, add neither health-care nor economic value, and have
little</p>
<p>or nothing to do with patient care and patient
well-being-primarily,</p>
<p>of course, the ever swelling avalanche of paperwork for Medicare,</p>
<p>Medicaid, insurers, the billing office, and the prevention of
malprac-</p>
<p>ice suits.</p>
<p>The situation in higher education is not much different. Every
study</p>
<p>reports that faculty in colleges and universities spend steadily
increas-</p>
<p>ing hours in committee meetings rather than in the classroom, in</p>
<p>advising students, or in research. But few of these committees
would</p>
<p>ever be missed. And they would do a better job and in less time if
they</p>
<p>had three instead of seven members.</p>
<p>Salespeople are just as splintered. In the department store they
now</p>
<p>spend so much time serving the computer that they have little
time</p>
<p>serving the customer-the main reason, perhaps, for the steady
decline</p>
<p>in their productivity as producers of sales and revenues. Field
sales</p>
<p>representatives spend up to one third of their time filling out
reports of</p>
<p>all kinds rather than calling on customers. And engineers sit
through</p>
<p>meeting after meeting when they should be busy at their work
stations.</p>
<p>This is not job enrichment; it is job impoverishment. It destroys</p>
<p>productivity. It saps motivation and morale. Nurses, every
attitude</p>
<p>survey shows, bitterly resent not being allowed to do what they
went</p>
<p>into nursing for and are trained to do-to give patient care at
the</p>
<p>patient bed. They also-understandably-feel that they are grossly
un-</p>
<p>derpaid for what they are capable of doing while the hospital
adminis-</p>
<p>rator–equally understandably-feels that they are grossly overpaid</p>
<p>for the unskilled clerical work they are actually doing.</p>
<p>The cure is fairly easy, as a rule. A few hospitals have taken
the</p>
<p>paperwork out of the nurses’ job and given it to a floor clerk who
also</p>
<p>answers the telephone calls from friends and relatives of patients
and</p>
<p>arranges the flowers they send in. All of a sudden, these hospitals
had</p>
<p>a surplus of nurses. The level of patient care and the hours
nurses</p>
<p>The New Productivity Challenge 223</p>
<p>devote to it went up sharply. Yet the hospitals could cut the number
of</p>
<p>nurses needed by a quarter or a third, and could thus raise
nurses’</p>
<p>salaries without incurring a higher nursing payroll.</p>
<p>To do this requires that we ask in respect to every knowledge and</p>
<p>service job: “What do we pay for?“ “What value is this job
supposed</p>
<p>o add?“ The answer is not always obvious or uncontroversial. One</p>
<p>department store that raised the question in respect to its
salespeople on</p>
<p>he floor answered: “Sales.“ Another one in the same metropolitan</p>
<p>area and with pretty much the same kind of clientele answered:
“Cus-</p>
<p>omer service. “ Each answer led to a different restructuring of the
jobs</p>
<p>on the sales floor. But each store achieved, and fairly fast,
substantial</p>
<p>increases in the revenues generated by each salesperson and each</p>
<p>department, that is, in both productivity and profitability.</p>
<p>For all their tremendous worldwide impacts Frederic Taylor and</p>
<p>Scientific Management have had a bad press, especially in
academia.</p>
<p>One reason, perhaps the main one, is the unrelenting campaign
Ameri-</p>
<p>ca’s labor unions waged against both in the early years of this
century.</p>
<p>The unions actually succeeded in banning any kind of work study
in</p>
<p>army arsenals and naval shipyards, where in those years practically
all</p>
<p>defense production was done in this country.</p>
<p>The unions of 1911 did not oppose Taylor because they thought him</p>
<p>pro-management or anti-labor (he was neither). His unforgivable
sin</p>
<p>was his assertion that there is no such thing as skill in making
and</p>
<p>moving things. All such work, Taylor asserted, was the same. All</p>
<p>could be analyzed step by step as a series of unskilled operations
that</p>
<p>hen could be put together into any kind of job. Anyone willing to
learn</p>
<p>hese operations would be a “first-class man, “ deserving
“first-class</p>
<p>pay. “ He could do the most highly skilled work and do it to
perfection.</p>
<p>But the unions of Taylor’s time-and especially the highly
respected</p>
<p>and extremely powerful unions in arsenals and shipyards-were
craft</p>
<p>monopolies. Their power base was their control of an apprenticeship
of</p>
<p>five or seven years to which, as a rule, only relatives of members
were</p>
<p>admitted. They considered their craft a “mystery,“ the secrets of</p>
<p>which no member was allowed to divulge. The skilled workers in
the</p>
<p>arsenals and navy yards in particular were paid extremely
well-more</p>
<p>han most physicians of those times and triple what Taylor’s
“first-</p>
<p>class man“ could then expect to get. No wonder that Taylor’s denial
of</p>
<p>he mystery of craft and skill infuriated these “aristocrats of labor“
as</p>
<p>subversion and pestilential heresy.</p>
<p>Most contemporaries, eighty years ago, agreed with the unions.</p>
<p>Even thirty years later the belief in the mystery of craft and
skill</p>
<p>persisted, and also in the long years of apprenticeship needed to</p>
<p>acquire either. Hitler, for instance, was convinced that it would
take</p>
<p>he United States at least five years to train optical craftsmen,
and</p>
<p>modern war requires precision optics. It would therefore take
many</p>
<p>years, Hitler was sure, before America could field an effective
army</p>
<p>and air force in Europe-the conviction that made him declare war
on</p>
<p>America when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>We now know that Taylor was right. The United States did indeed</p>
<p>have almost no optical craftsmen in 1941. And modem war does</p>
<p>indeed require precision optics, and in large quantities. But by
apply-</p>
<p>ing Taylor’s Scientific Management the U.S. trained in a few
months</p>
<p>semiskilled workers to turn out more highly advanced optics than
the</p>
<p>Germans with their craftsmen ever did, and on the assembly line
to</p>
<p>boot. And by that time Taylor’s first-class men with their
increased</p>
<p>productivity also made a great deal more money than any craftsman
of</p>
<p>1911 could ever have dreamed of.</p>
<p>Eventually knowledge work and service work may turn out to be</p>
<p>like work making and moving things-that is, “just work,“ to use
an</p>
<p>old Scientific Management slogan. At least this is the position of
the</p>
<p>more radical proponents of Artificial Intelligence, Taylor’s true
chil-</p>
<p>dren or grandchildren. But for the time being, knowledge and
service</p>
<p>jobs must not be treated as just work. They cannot be assumed to
be</p>
<p>homogeneous. They must be treated as falling into a number of
distinct</p>
<p>categories-probably three. Each requires different analysis and
dif-</p>
<p>ferent organization. In making and moving things the focus in
increas-</p>
<p>ing productivity is on work. In knowledge and service work it has to
be</p>
<p>on performance.</p>
<p>To be specific: for some jobs in knowledge and service work</p>
<p>performance means quality. One example is the research lab, in
which</p>
<p>quantity-that is, the number of results-is quite secondary to
their</p>
<p>quality. One new drug generating annual sales of 00 million and</p>
<p>dominating the market for a decade is infinitely more valuable
than</p>
<p>The New Productivity Challenge 225</p>
<p>wenty “me too“ drugs each with annual sales of 0 or 0 million.</p>
<p>The same holds for basic policy or for strategic decisions. But it
also</p>
<p>applies to much less grandiose work-the physician’s diagnosis,
for</p>
<p>instance, or packaging design, or editing a magazine.</p>
<p>Then there is a wide range of knowledge and service jobs in which</p>
<p>quality and quantity together constitute performance. The
salesper-</p>
<p>son’s performance on the department-store floor is one example. A</p>
<p>“satisfied customer“ is a qualitative statement, and indeed not so
easy</p>
<p>o define. But it is as important as the amounts on the sales tickets,
or</p>
<p>he quantity of output. In architectural design quality largely
defines</p>
<p>performance. In the draftsman’s work quality is an integral part
of</p>
<p>performance. But so is quantity. And the same applies to the
engineer;</p>
<p>o the sales rep in the local stockbroker’s office; to the medical</p>
<p>echnologist; to the branch manager of the local bank; to the
reporter,</p>
<p>o the nurse; to the claims adjuster for the automotive insurer-in
fact,</p>
<p>o a vast range of knowledge and service jobs. Performance in them
is</p>
<p>always both, quantity and quality. To increase productivity in
these</p>
<p>jobs therefore always requires work on both.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a good many jobs-filing, handling death claims</p>
<p>in the life insurance office, making beds in the hospital-in
which</p>
<p>performance is similar to performance in making and moving
things.</p>
<p>Quality is a condition and a restraint. It is external rather than in
itself</p>
<p>performance. It has to be built into the process. But once this has
been</p>
<p>done, performance is largely defined by quantity-for example, the</p>
<p>number of minutes it takes to make a hospital bed the prescribed
way.</p>
<p>These jobs are, in effect, “production jobs“ even though they do
not</p>
<p>result in making and moving things.</p>
<p>Thus increasing productivity in knowledge and service work re-</p>
<p>quires thinking through into which category of performance a
given</p>
<p>job belongs. Only then do we know what we should be working on.</p>
<p>Only then can we decide what needs to be analyzed, what needs to
be</p>
<p>improved, what needs to be changed. For only then do we know what</p>
<p>productivity means in a specific knowledge or service job.</p>
<p>There is more to increasing productivity in knowledge work and</p>
<p>service work than defining the task, concentrating on the task,
and</p>
<p>defining performance. We do not yet know how to analyze the
process</p>
<p>in jobs in which performance predominantly means quality. We need</p>
<p>o ask instead, “What works?“ For jobs in which performance means</p>
<p>both quality and quantity, we need to do both: ask what works and</p>
<p>analyze the process step by step and operation by operation. In
produc-</p>
<p>ion work we need to define the quality standards and build them
into</p>
<p>he process, but the actual productivity improvement then comes</p>
<p>hrough fairly conventional industrial engineering, that is, through
task</p>
<p>analysis followed by putting together the individual simple
operations</p>
<p>into a complete “job.“</p>
<p>But the three steps outlined above will by themselves produce</p>
<p>substantial productivity increases-perhaps most of what can be
at-</p>
<p>ained at any one time. They need to be worked through again and</p>
<p>again-maybe every three or five years, and certainly whenever we</p>
<p>change work or its organization. But then, according to all the
experi-</p>
<p>ence we have, the resulting productivity increases will equal, if
not</p>
<p>exceed, whatever Industrial Engineering, Scientific Management,
or</p>
<p>Human Relations ever achieved in making and moving things. In
other</p>
<p>words, they should by themselves give us the “productivity
revolu-</p>
<p>ion“ we need in knowledge and service work.</p>
<p>But on one condition only: that we actually apply what we have</p>
<p>learned since World War I1 about increasing productivity in
making</p>
<p>and moving things: the work has to be done in partnership with
the</p>
<p>people who hold the knowledge and service jobs, the people who are
to</p>
<p>become more productive. The goal has to be to build responsibility
for</p>
<p>productivity and performance into every knowledge and service job</p>
<p>regardless of level, difficulty, or skill.</p>
<p>Frederick Taylor has often been criticized for never once asking
the</p>
<p>workers whose jobs he studied; he told them. Nor did Elton Mayo
ever</p>
<p>ask-he also told them. But there is also no record of Sigmund
Freud’s</p>
<p>ever asking patients what they thought might be their problem.
Neither</p>
<p>Marx nor Lenin ever thought of asking the masses. And it did not</p>
<p>occur to any High Command in World War I or World War I1 to ask</p>
<p>junior officers or enlisted men in the front lines about weapons,</p>
<p>uniforms, or even food (in the American armed forces this became
the</p>
<p>custom only during Vietnam). Taylor simply shared the belief of
his</p>
<p>age in the wisdom of the expert. He thought both workers and man-</p>
<p>The New Productivity Challenge 227</p>
<p>agers to be “dumb oxen.“ Mayo, forty years later, had high
respect</p>
<p>for managers, but workers, he thought, were “immature“ and “mal-</p>
<p>adjusted“ and needed the expert guidance of the psychologist.</p>
<p>When World War I1 came, however, we had no choice; we had to</p>
<p>ask the workers. In the plants we had neither engineers nor
psycholo-</p>
<p>gists nor foremen-they were all in uniform. And when we asked the</p>
<p>workers, we found-to our immense surprise, as I still
recollect-that</p>
<p>he workers were neither dumb oxen nor immature and maladjusted.</p>
<p>They knew a great deal about the work they were doing, its logic
and</p>
<p>rhythm, the tools, the quality and so on. Asking them was the way
to</p>
<p>get started on productivity and quality.* At first only a few
businesses</p>
<p>accepted this novel proposition-IBM was perhaps the first one,
and</p>
<p>for a long time also the only one. Then in the late 1950s and
early</p>
<p>1960s it was picked up by the Japanese, whose earlier attempts to</p>
<p>return to prewar autocracy in the plant had collapsed in bloody
strikes</p>
<p>and near civil war. Nowadays, while still far from being widely</p>
<p>practiced, it is at least generally accepted in theory that the
workers’</p>
<p>knowledge of their job is the starting point for improving
productivity,</p>
<p>quality, and performance altogether.</p>
<p>In making and moving things, partnership with the responsible</p>
<p>worker is, however, only the best way-after all, Taylor’s telling
them</p>
<p>worked, too, and quite well. In knowledge and service work,
partner-</p>
<p>ship with the responsible worker is the only way; nothing else
will</p>
<p>work at all.</p>
<p>Two more lessons that neither Taylor nor Mayo knew; increased</p>
<p>productivity needs continuous learning. It is not enough to redesign
the</p>
<p>job and then to train the worker in the new way of doing it-which
is</p>
<p>what Taylor did and taught. That’s when learning begins, and it
never</p>
<p>ends. Indeed, as the Japanese can teach us-it came out of their</p>
<p>ancient tradition of Zen learning-the greatest benefit of training is
not</p>
<p>in learning the new. It is to do better what we already do well.
And</p>
<p>equally important, an insight of the last few years: knowledge
people</p>
<p>and service people learn the most when they teach. The best way
to</p>
<p>improve the productivity of the star salesperson is for him or her
to</p>
<p>present “the secrets of my success“ at a sales convention. The
best</p>
<p>way for the surgeon to improve his or her performance is to give a
talk</p>
<p>about it at the county medical society. The best way for a nurse
to</p>
<p>improve her performance is to teach her fellow nurses. It is often
being</p>
<p>said that in the information age every enterprise has to become a</p>
<p>learning institution. It also has to become a teaching
institution.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Developed economies face economic stagnation if they do not raise</p>
<p>he productivity of knowledge and service work. Even Japan-still</p>
<p>heavily manufacturing-intensive+an no longer expect increased
pro-</p>
<p>ductivity in making and moving things to sustain economic growth.</p>
<p>Even there the great majority of working people are knowledge
work-</p>
<p>ers and service workers with productivities as low as those in any
other</p>
<p>developed country. And when farmers are down to a mere 3 percent
of</p>
<p>he employed population, as they are in the U.S. and Japan-and in</p>
<p>most of Western Europe as well–even record increases in their
pro-</p>
<p>ductivity such as the 4 to 5 percent the United States boasts of
add</p>
<p>virtually nothing to the country’s overall productivity, its wealth,
its</p>
<p>competitiveness.</p>
<p>Raising the productivity of knowledge and service work must
there-</p>
<p>fore be an economic priority for developed countries. Whichever</p>
<p>country first succeeds in satisfying it will economically dominate
the</p>
<p>wenty-first century. And the key is raising the productivity of
knowl-</p>
<p>edge work, on all levels.</p>
<p>But the need to raise the productivity of service work may be
even</p>
<p>greater. It is a social priority in developed countries. Unless it is
met,</p>
<p>he developed work faces increasing social tensions, increasing
polar-</p>
<p>ization, increasing radicalization. It may ultimately face a new
class</p>
<p>war.</p>
<p>In the knowledge society, access to opportunities for careers and</p>
<p>advancement is becoming limited to people of advanced schooling,</p>
<p>people qualified for knowledge work. But such people will always be
a</p>
<p>minority. They will always be outnumbered by people who lack the</p>
<p>qualifications for anything but fairly low-skilled service work. In
their</p>
<p>social position such people are comparable to the proletarians of
years</p>
<p>ago: the poorly educated, unskilled masses who thronged the
explod-</p>
<p>ing industrial cities and streamed into their factories.</p>
<p>When Frederick Taylor started his work on the productivity of</p>
<p>making and moving things in the early 1880s, class war between</p>
<p>The New Productivity Challenge 229</p>
<p>industrial proletarian and “bourgeois“-its reality but even more
the</p>
<p>fear of it-obsessed every developed country. Fear of it motivated</p>
<p>Taylor to start his work. And the belief in the inevitability of
class war</p>
<p>was by no means confined to the Left. A generation before Taylor,</p>
<p>Benjamin Disraeli, the greatest of the nineteenth-century
conserva-</p>
<p>ives, had predicted it. And Henry James, the chronicler of
American</p>
<p>wealth and European aristocracy, was so frightened by it that he
made</p>
<p>it the central theme of one of his most haunting novels, The
Princess</p>
<p>Casamassima-it appeared in 1885, two years after Marx’s death and</p>
<p>four years after Taylor had begun studying the productivity of
shovel-</p>
<p>ing sand.</p>
<p>Marx has been proven wrong in his prophesy of the inevitable “im-</p>
<p>miseration“ of the proletariat leading inevitably to a revolution.
But</p>
<p>when he made these prophesies they seemed eminently reasonable-</p>
<p>indeed, almost self-evident-to well-informed and highly
intelligent</p>
<p>contemporaries. What defeated Marx and Marxism in the end was the</p>
<p>rising productivity of making and moving things-that is, in
essence,</p>
<p>he work Taylor started. It gave the proletarians the productivity
that</p>
<p>allowed their being paid a middle-class income and to achieve
middle-</p>
<p>class status despite lack of skill, wealth, and education. By the
time of</p>
<p>he Great Depression-when, according to Marx and the Marxists the</p>
<p>“Proletarian Revolution“ should surely have become triumphant-the</p>
<p>proletarian had become a bourgeois.</p>
<p>Unless the productivity of service work is rapidly improved, both</p>
<p>he social and the economic position of that large class-as large
a</p>
<p>group as people making and moving things ever were at their peak-</p>
<p>must steadily go down. Real incomes cannot for any length of time
be</p>
<p>higher than productivity. The service workers may use their
numerical</p>
<p>strength to get higher wages than their economic contribution
justifies.</p>
<p>But this only impoverishes all of society with everybody’s real
income</p>
<p>going down and unemployment going up. Or the incomes of the</p>
<p>unskilled service workers are allowed to go down in relation to
the</p>
<p>steadily rising wages of affluent knowledge workers, with an
increas-</p>
<p>ing gulf between the two groups, an increasing polarization into</p>
<p>classes. In either case service workers must become alienated,
increas-</p>
<p>ingly bitter, increasingly see themselves as a class apart. And
the</p>
<p>escape hatch-the productive and therefore well-paid jobs for
poorly</p>
<p>educated and poorly skilled people in making and moving things-is</p>
<p>closing rapidly. By the end of this century the number of such jobs
in</p>
<p>every developed country will be at most two fifths of what it was
at</p>
<p>heir peak only forty years ago.</p>
<p>We are in a much better position than our ancestors were a
century</p>
<p>ago. We know what Marx and his contemporaries did not know:</p>
<p>productivity can be raised. We also know how to raise it. And we</p>
<p>know this best for the work where the social need is most urgent:</p>
<p>unskilled and semiskilled service work-the jobs in maintenance,</p>
<p>whether of factories, schools, hospitals, or offices; in restaurants
and</p>
<p>in supermarkets; in a host of clerical jobs. This, as has already
been</p>
<p>stated, is production work-and what we have learned during the
past</p>
<p>hundred years about increasing productivity applies to such work
with</p>
<p>a minimum of adaptation. Indeed, in such work substantial produc-</p>
<p>ivity increases have already been achieved. Some multinational
main-</p>
<p>enance companies-both in the United States and in Europe-have</p>
<p>systematically applied to low-skilled service jobs the approaches
this</p>
<p>article discusses. They have defined the task; concentrated work on
it;</p>
<p>defined performance; made the employee a partner in productivity</p>
<p>improvement and the first source of ideas for it; and built
continuous</p>
<p>learning and continuous teaching into the job of every employee and
of</p>
<p>every work team. They have substantially raised productivity-in</p>
<p>some cases, doubled it. This then has allowed them to raise wages.
But</p>
<p>it has also greatly raised self-respect and pride. It is,
incidentally, by</p>
<p>no means coincidence that these increases were achieved by
outside</p>
<p>contractors rather than by the organization (e.g., the hospitals)
in</p>
<p>which the service people actually do their work. To obtain major</p>
<p>productivity increases in production-type service work usually
requires</p>
<p>contracting out such work to a firm that has no other business,
under-</p>
<p>stands this work, respects it, and offers opportunities for
advancement</p>
<p>for low-skill service workers-for example, to become its local or</p>
<p>regional manager. The organizations in which this work is being</p>
<p>done-for example, the hospital in which the people work who make</p>
<p>he beds, or the college whose students they feed-neither
understand</p>
<p>such work nor respect it enough to devote to it the time and hard
work</p>
<p>needed to make it productive, no matter how much they pay for it.</p>
<p>The task is known and doable, but the urgency is great. To raise
the</p>
<p>productivity of service work cannot be done by governmental action
or</p>
<p>by politics altogether. It is the task of managers and executives
in</p>
<p>The New Productivity Challenge 231</p>
<p>businesses and nonprofit organizations. It is, in fact, the first
social</p>
<p>responsibility of management in the knowledge society.</p>
