<h4 id="the-emerging-theory-of-manufacturing">The Emerging Theory of
Manufacturing</h4>
<p>We cannot build it yet. But already we can specify the “post-</p>
<p>modern“ factory of 1999. Its essence will not be mechanical,
though</p>
<p>here will be plenty of machines. Its essence will be
conceptual-the</p>
<p>product of four principles and practices that together constitute a
new</p>
<p>approach to manufacturing.</p>
<p>Each of these concepts is being developed separately, by
different</p>
<p>people with different starting points and different agendas. Each
con-</p>
<p>cept has its own objectives and its own kinds of impact.
Statistical</p>
<p>Quality Control is changing the social organization of the factory.
The</p>
<p>new manufacturing accounting lets us make production decisions as</p>
<p>business decisions. The “flotilla, “ or module, organization of
the</p>
<p>manufacturing process promises to combine the advantages of stan-</p>
<p>dardization and flexibility. Finally, the systems approach embeds
the</p>
<p>physical process of making things, that is, manufacturing, in the</p>
<p>economic process of business, that is, the business of creating
value.</p>
<p>As these four concepts develop, they are transforming how we
think</p>
<p>about manufacturing and how we manage it. Most manufacturing</p>
<p>people in the United States now know we need a new theory of</p>
<p>manufacturing. We know that patching up old theories has not
worked</p>
<p>and that further patching will only push us further behind.
Together</p>
<p>hese concepts give us the foundation for the new theory we so
badly</p>
<p>need.</p>
<p>First published in The Harvard Business Review, 1990.</p>
<p>The most widely publicized of these concepts, Statistical Quality</p>
<p>Control (SQC), is actually not new at all. It rests on statistical
theory</p>
<p>formulated seventy years ago by Sir Ronald Fisher. Walter
Shewhart,</p>
<p>a Bell Laboratories physicist, designed the original version of SQC
in</p>
<p>he 1930s for the zero-defects mass production of complex
telephone</p>
<p>exchanges and telephone sets. During World War 11, W. Edwards</p>
<p>Deming and Joseph Juran, both former members of Shewhart’s
circle,</p>
<p>separately developed the versions used today.</p>
<p>The Japanese owe their leadership in manufacturing quality
largely</p>
<p>o their embrace of Deming’s precepts in the 1950s and 1960s.
Juran</p>
<p>oo had great impact in Japan. But U.S. industry ignored their
contri-</p>
<p>butions for forty years and is only now converting to SQC, with</p>
<p>companies such as Ford, General Motors, and Xerox among the</p>
<p>new disciples. Western Europe also has largely ignored the
concept.</p>
<p>More important, even SQC’s most successful practitioners do not</p>
<p>horoughly understand what it really does. Generally it is considered
a</p>
<p>production tool. Actually, its greatest impact is on the factory’s
social</p>
<p>organization.</p>
<p>By now, everyone with an interest in manufacturing knows that</p>
<p>SQC is a rigorous, scientific method of identifying the quality
and</p>
<p>productivity that can be expected from a given production process
in</p>
<p>its current form so that control of both attributes can be built into
the</p>
<p>process itself. In addition, SQC can instantly spot malfunctions
and</p>
<p>show where they occur-a worn tool, a dirty spray gun, an
overheating</p>
<p>furnace. And because it can do this with a small sample,
malfunctions</p>
<p>are reported almost immediately, allowing machine operators to
cor-</p>
<p>rect problems in real time. Further, SQC quickly identifies the
impact</p>
<p>of any change on the performance of the entire process. (Indeed,
in</p>
<p>some applications developed by Deming’s Japanese disciples,
comput-</p>
<p>ers can simulate the effects of a proposed change in advance.)
Finally,</p>
<p>SQC identifies where, and often how, the quality and productivity
of</p>
<p>he entire process can be continuously improved. This used to be
called</p>
<p>he “Shewhart Cycle“ and then the “Deming Cycle“; now it is</p>
<p>kaizen, the Japanese term for continuous improvement.</p>
<p>But these engineering characteristics explain only a fraction of</p>
<p>SQC’s results. Above all, they do not explain the productivity
gap</p>
<p>between Japanese and U.S. factories. Even after adjusting for their
far</p>
<p>The Emerging Theory of Manufacturing 235</p>
<p>greater reliance on outside suppliers, Toyota, Honda, and Nissan
turn</p>
<p>out two or three times more cars per worker than comparable U.S.
or</p>
<p>European plants do. Building quality into the process accounts for
no</p>
<p>more than one-third of this difference. Japan’s major
productivity</p>
<p>gains are the result of social changes brought about by SQC.</p>
<p>The Japanese employ proportionately more machine operators in</p>
<p>direct production work than Ford or GM. In fact, the introduction
of</p>
<p>SQC almost always increases the number of machine operators. But</p>
<p>his increase is offset many times over by the sharp drop in the
number</p>
<p>of nonoperators: inspectors, above all, but also the people who do
not</p>
<p>do but f i x , like repair crews and “fire fighters“ of all
kinds.</p>
<p>In U .S . factories, especially mass-production plants, such non-</p>
<p>operating, blue-collar employees substantially outnumber operators.
In</p>
<p>some plants, the ratio is two to one. Few of these workers are
needed</p>
<p>under SQC. Moreover, first-line supervisors also are gradually
elimi-</p>
<p>nated, with only a handful of trainers taking their place. In
other</p>
<p>words, not only does SQC make it possible for machine operators to
be</p>
<p>in control of their work, it makes such control almost mandatory.
No</p>
<p>one else has the hands-on knowledge needed to act effectively on
the</p>
<p>information that SQC constantly feeds back.</p>
<p>By aligning information with accountability, SQC resolves a here-</p>
<p>ofore irresolvable conflict. For more than a century, two basic
ap-</p>
<p>proaches to manufacturing have prevailed, especially in the
United</p>
<p>States. One is the engineering approach pioneered by Frederick
Wins-</p>
<p>low Taylor’s “scientific management.“ The other is the “human</p>
<p>relations“ (or “human resources“) approach developed before World</p>
<p>War I by Andrew Carnegie, Julius Rosenwald of Sears Roebuck, and</p>
<p>Hugo Miinsterberg, a Harvard psychologist. The two approaches
have</p>
<p>always been considered antitheses, indeed, mutually exclusive. In</p>
<p>SQC, they come together.</p>
<p>Taylor and his disciples were just as determined as Deming to
build</p>
<p>quality and productivity into the manufacturing process. Taylor
assert-</p>
<p>ed that his “one right way“ guaranteed zero-defects quality; he was
as</p>
<p>vehemently opposed to inspectors as Deming is today. So was Henry</p>
<p>Ford, who claimed that his assembly line built quality and
productivity</p>
<p>into the process (though he was otherwise untouched by Taylor’s</p>
<p>scientific management and probably did not even know about it).
But</p>
<p>without SQC’s rigorous methodology, neither scientific management</p>
<p>nor the assembly line could actually deliver built-in process
control.</p>
<p>With all their successes, both scientific management and the
assembly</p>
<p>line had to fall back on massive inspection, to fix problems rather
than</p>
<p>eliminate them.</p>
<p>The human-relations approach sees the knowledge and pride of line</p>
<p>workers as the greatest resource for controlling and improving
quality</p>
<p>and productivity. It too has had important successes. But without
the</p>
<p>kind of information SQC provides, you cannot readily distinguish</p>
<p>productive activity from busyness. It is also hard to tell whether
a</p>
<p>proposed modification will truly improve the process or simply
make</p>
<p>hings look better in one comer, only to make them worse overall.</p>
<p>Quality circles, which were actually invented and widely used in</p>
<p>U.S. industry during World War 11, have been successful in Japan</p>
<p>because they came in after SQC had been established. As a result,
both</p>
<p>he quality circle and management have objective information about</p>
<p>he effects of workers’ suggestions. In contrast, most U.S.
quality</p>
<p>circles of the last twenty years have failed despite great
enthusiasm,</p>
<p>especially on the part of the workers. The reason? They were
estab-</p>
<p>lished without SQC, that is, without rigorous and reliable
feedback.</p>
<p>A good many U.S. manufacturers have built quality and produc-</p>
<p>ivity into their manufacturing processes without SQC and yet with
a</p>
<p>minimum of inspection and fixing. Johnson andandandand Johnson is one
such</p>
<p>example. Other companies have successfully put machine operators
in</p>
<p>control of the manufacturing process without instituting SQC. IBM</p>
<p>long ago replaced all first-line supervisors with a handful of
“manag-</p>
<p>ers“ whose main task is to train, while Herman Miller achieves
zero-</p>
<p>defects quality and high productivity through continuous training
and</p>
<p>productivity-sharing incentives.</p>
<p>But these are exceptions. In the main, the United States has
lacked</p>
<p>he methodology to build quality and productivity into the
manufactur-</p>
<p>ing process. Similarly, we have lacked the methodology to move</p>
<p>responsibility for the process and control of it to the machine
operator,</p>
<p>o put into practice what the mathematician Norbert Wiener called
the</p>
<p>“human use of human beings. “</p>
<p>SQC makes it possible to attain both traditional aspirations:
high</p>
<p>quality and productivity on the one hand, work worthy of human</p>
<p>beings on the other. By fulfilling the aims of the traditional
factory, it</p>
<p>The Emerging Theory of Manufacturing 237</p>
<p>provides the capstone for the edifice of twentieth-century
manufactur-</p>
<p>ing that Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford designed.</p>
<p>Bean counters do not enjoy a good press these days. They are</p>
<p>blamed for all the ills that afflict U.S. manufacturing. But the
bean</p>
<p>counters will have the last laugh. In the factory of 1999,
manufacturing</p>
<p>accounting will play as big a role as it ever did and probably even
a</p>
<p>bigger one. But the beans will be counted differently. The new
manu-</p>
<p>facturing accounting, which might more accurately be called
“manu-</p>
<p>facturing economics,“ differs radically from traditional cost
account-</p>
<p>ing in its basic concepts. Its aim is to integrate manufacturing
with</p>
<p>business strategy.</p>
<p>Manufacturing cost accounting (cost accounting’s rarely used full</p>
<p>name) is the third leg of the stool-the other legs being
scientific</p>
<p>management and the assembly l i n e - o n which modern
manufacturing</p>
<p>industry rests. Without cost accounting, these two could never
have</p>
<p>become fully effective. It too is American in origin. Developed in
the</p>
<p>1920s by General Motors, General Electric, and Western Electric</p>
<p>(ATandandandandT’s manufacturing arm), the new cost accounting, not
technolo-</p>
<p>gy, gave GM and GE the competitive edge that made them worldwide</p>
<p>industry leaders. Following World War 11, cost accounting became
a</p>
<p>major U.S. export.</p>
<p>But by that time, cost accounting’s limitations also were
becoming</p>
<p>apparent. Four are particularly important. First, cost accounting
is</p>
<p>based on the realities of the 1920s, when direct, blue-collar
labor</p>
<p>accounted for 80 percent of all manufacturing costs other than
raw</p>
<p>materials. Consequently, cost accounting equates “cost“ with
direct</p>
<p>labor cost. Everything else is “miscellaneous, “ lumped together
as</p>
<p>overhead.</p>
<p>These days, however, a plant in which direct labor cost runs as
high</p>
<p>as 25 percent is a rare exception. Even in automobiles, the most
labor</p>
<p>intensive of the major industries, direct labor cost in up-to-date
plants</p>
<p>(such as those the Japanese are building in the United States and
some</p>
<p>of the new Ford plants) is down to 18 percent. And 8 percent or
12</p>
<p>percent is fast becoming the industrial norm. One large
manufacturing</p>
<p>company with a labor-intensive process, Beckman Instruments, now</p>
<p>considers labor cost “miscellaneous.“ But typically, cost
accounting</p>
<p>systems are still based on direct labor costs that are carefully,
indeed</p>
<p>minutely, accounted for. The remaining costs-and that can mean 80</p>
<p>percent to 90 percent-are allocated by ratios that everyone knows
are</p>
<p>purely arbitrary and totally misleading: in direct proportion to a
prod-</p>
<p>uct’s labor cost, for example, or to its dollar volume.</p>
<p>Second, the benefits of a change in process or in method are</p>
<p>primarily defined in terms of labor cost savings. If other savings
are</p>
<p>considered at all, it is usually on the basis of the same
arbitrary</p>
<p>allocation by which costs other than direct labor are accounted
for.</p>
<p>Even more serious is the third limitation, one built into the
tradition-</p>
<p>al cost accounting system. Like a sundial, which shows the hours
when</p>
<p>he sun shines but gives no information on a cloudy day or at
night,</p>
<p>raditional cost accounting measures only the costs of producing.
It</p>
<p>ignores the costs of nonproducing, whether they result from
machine</p>
<p>downtime or from quality defects that require scrapping or reworking
a</p>
<p>product or part.</p>
<p>Standard cost accounting assumes that the manufacturing process</p>
<p>urns out good products 80 percent of the time. But we now know
that</p>
<p>even with the best SQC, nonproducing time consumes far more than</p>
<p>20 percent of total production time. In some plants, it accounts for
50</p>
<p>percent. And nonproducing time costs as much as producing time</p>
<p>does-in wages, heat, lighting, interest, salaries, even raw
materials.</p>
<p>Yet the traditional system measures none of this.</p>
<p>Finally, manufacturing cost accounting assumes the factory is an</p>
<p>isolated entity. Cost savings in the factory are “real.“ The rest
is</p>
<p>“speculation“-for example, the impact of a manufacturing process</p>
<p>change on a product’s acceptance in the market or on service
quality.</p>
<p>GM’s plight since the 1970s illustrates the problem with this
assump-</p>
<p>ion. Marketing people were unhappy with top management’s decision</p>
<p>o build all car models, from Chevrolet to Cadillac, from the same</p>
<p>small number of bodies, frames, and engines. But the cost
accounting</p>
<p>model showed that such commonality would produce substantial
labor</p>
<p>cost savings. And so marketing’s argument that GM cars would lose</p>
<p>customer appeal as they looked more and more alike was brushed
aside</p>
<p>as speculation. In effect, traditional cost accounting can hardly
justify</p>
<p>a product improvement, let alone a product or process innovation.</p>
<p>Automation, for instance, shows up as a cost but almost never as
a</p>
<p>benefit.</p>
<p>All this we have known for close to forty years. And for thirty
years,</p>
<p>The Emerging Theory of Manufacturing 239</p>
<p>accounting scholars, government accountants, industry
accountants,</p>
<p>and accounting firms have worked hard to reform the system. They</p>
<p>have made substantial improvements. But since the reform attempts</p>
<p>ried to build on the traditional system, the original limitations
remain.</p>
<p>What triggered the change to the new manufacturing accounting was</p>
<p>he frustration of factory-automation equipment makers. The
potential</p>
<p>users, the people in the plants, badly wanted the new equipment.
But</p>
<p>op management could not be persuaded to spend the money on numer-</p>
<p>ically controlled machine tools or robots that could rapidly
change</p>
<p>ools, fixtures, and molds. The benefits of automated equipment,
we</p>
<p>now know, lie primarily in the reduction of nonproducing time by</p>
<p>improving quality (that is, getting it right the first time) and by
sharply</p>
<p>curtailing machine downtime in changing over from one model or</p>
<p>product to another. But these gains cost accounting does not
docu-</p>
<p>ment.</p>
<p>Out of this frustration came Computer-Aided Manufacturing Inter-</p>
<p>national, or CAM-I, a cooperative effort by automation producers,</p>
<p>multinational manufacturers, and accountants to develop a new
cost</p>
<p>accounting system. Started in 1986, CAM-I is just beginning to
influ-</p>
<p>ence manufacturing practice. But already it has unleashed an
intellec-</p>
<p>ual revolution. The most exciting and innovative work in
management</p>
<p>oday is found in accounting theory, with new concepts, new ap-</p>
<p>proaches, new methodology-even what might be called new econom-</p>
<p>ic philosophy-rapidly taking shape. And while there is enormous</p>
<p>controversy over specifics, the lineaments of the new
manufacturing</p>
<p>accounting are becoming clearer every day.</p>
<p>As soon as CAM-I began its work, it became apparent that the</p>
<p>raditional accounting system could not be reformed. It had to be</p>
<p>replaced. Labor costs are clearly the wrong unit of measurement
in</p>
<p>manufacturing. But-and this is a new insight-so are all the other</p>
<p>elements of production. The new measurement unit has to be time.
The</p>
<p>costs for a given period of time must be assumed to be fixed; there
are</p>
<p>no “variable“ costs. Even material costs are more fixed than
variable,</p>
<p>since defective output uses as much material as good output does.
The</p>
<p>only thing that is both variable and controllable is how much time
a</p>
<p>given process takes. And “benefit“ is whatever reduces that time.
In</p>
<p>one fell swoop, this insight eliminates the first three of cost
account-</p>
<p>ing’s four traditional limitations.</p>
<p>But the new cost concepts go even further by redefining what
costs</p>
<p>and benefits really are. For example, in the traditional cost
accounting</p>
<p>system, finished-goods inventory costs nothing because it does
not</p>
<p>absorb any direct labor. It is treated as an “asset.“ In the new</p>
<p>manufacturing accounting, however, inventory of finished goods is
a</p>
<p>“sunk cost“ (an economist’s, not an accountant’s, term). Stuff
that</p>
<p>sits in inventory does not earn anything. In fact, it ties down
expensive</p>
<p>money and absorbs time. As a result, its time costs are high. The
new</p>
<p>accounting measures these time costs against the benefits of
finished-</p>
<p>goods inventory (quicker customer service, for instance).</p>
<p>Yet manufacturing accounting still faces the challenge of
eliminat-</p>
<p>ing the fourth limitation of traditional cost accounting: its
inability to</p>
<p>bring into the measurement of factory performance the impact of</p>
<p>manufacturing changes on the total business-the return in the
mar-</p>
<p>ketplace of an investment in automation, for instance, or the risk in
not</p>
<p>making an investment that would speed up production changeovers.</p>
<p>The in-plant costs and benefits of such decisions can now be
worked</p>
<p>out with considerable accuracy. But the business consequences are</p>
<p>indeed speculative. One can only say, “Surely, this should help us
get</p>
<p>more sales,“ or “If we don’t do this, we risk falling behind in</p>
<p>customer service.“ But how do you quantify such opinions?</p>
<p>Cost accounting’s strength has always been that it confines itself
to</p>
<p>he measurable and thus gives objective answers. But if intangibles
are</p>
<p>brought into its equations, cost accounting will only raise more
ques-</p>
<p>ions. How to proceed is thus hotly debated, and with good reason.</p>
<p>Still, everyone agrees that these business impacts have to be
integrated</p>
<p>into the measurement of factory performance, that is, into
manufactur-</p>
<p>ing accounting. One way or another, the new accounting will force</p>
<p>managers, both inside and outside the plant, to make
manufacturing</p>
<p>decisions as business decisions.</p>
<p>Henry Ford’s epigram, “The customer can have any color as long as</p>
<p>it’s black,“ has entered American folklore. But few people
realize</p>
<p>what Ford meant: flexibility costs time and money, and the
customer</p>
<p>won’t pay for it. Even fewer people realize that in the mid-1920s,
the</p>
<p>“new“ cost accounting made it possible for GM to beat Ford by
giving</p>
<p>customers both colors and annual model changes at no additional
cost.</p>
<p>By now, most manufacturers can do what GM learned to do roughly</p>
<p>The Emerging Theory of Manufacturing 241</p>
<p>seventy years ago. Indeed, many go quite a bit further in
combining</p>
<p>standardization with flexibility. They can, for example, build a
variety</p>
<p>of end products from a fairly small number of standardized parts.
Still,</p>
<p>manufacturing people tend to think like Henry Ford: you can have</p>
<p>either standardization at low cost or flexibility at high cost, but
not</p>
<p>both.</p>
<p>The factory of 1999, however, will be based on the premise that
you</p>
<p>not only can have both but also must have both-and at low cost.
But</p>
<p>o achieve this, the factory will have to be structured quite
differently.</p>
<p>Today’s factory is a battleship. The plant of 1999 will be a
“flo-</p>
<p>illa,“ consisting of modules centered either around a stage in
the</p>
<p>production process or around a number of closely related
operations.</p>
<p>Though overall command and control will still exist, each module
will</p>
<p>have its own command and control. And each, like the ships in a</p>
<p>flotilla, will be maneuverable, both in terms of its position in the
entire</p>
<p>process and its relationship to other modules. This organization
will</p>
<p>give each module the benefits of standardization and, at the same
time,</p>
<p>give the whole process greater flexibility. Thus it will allow
rapid</p>
<p>changes in design and product, rapid response to market demands,</p>
<p>and low-cost production of “options“ or “specials“ in fairly
small</p>
<p>batches.</p>
<p>No such plant exists today. No one can yet build it. But many</p>
<p>manufacturers, large and small, are moving toward the flotilla
struc-</p>
<p>ure: among them are some of Westinghouse’s U.S. plants, Asea</p>
<p>Brown Boveri’s robotics plant in Sweden, and several large
printing</p>
<p>plants, especially in Japan.</p>
<p>The biggest impetus for this development probably came from GM’s</p>
<p>failure to get a return on its massive (at least 0 billion and
perhaps</p>
<p>0 billion) investment in automation. GM, it seems, used the new</p>
<p>machines to improve its existing process, that is, to make the
assembly</p>
<p>line more efficient. But the process instead became less flexible
and</p>
<p>less able to accomplish rapid change.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japanese automakers and Ford were spending less and</p>
<p>attaining more flexibility. In these plants, the line still exists,
but it is</p>
<p>discontinuous rather than tightly tied together. The new equipment
is</p>
<p>being used to speed changes, for example, automating changeovers
of</p>
<p>jigs, tools, and fixtures. So the line has acquired a good bit of
the</p>
<p>flexibility of traditional batch production without losing its
standard-</p>
<p>ization. Standardization and flexibility are thus no longer an
either-or</p>
<p>proposition. They are-as indeed they must be-melded together.</p>
<p>This means a different balance between standardization and flex-</p>
<p>ibility, however, for different parts of the manufacturing process.
An</p>
<p>“average“ balance across the plant will do nothing very well. If</p>
<p>imposed throughout the line, it will simply result in high rigidity
and</p>
<p>big costs for the entire process, which is apparently what happened
at</p>
<p>GM. What is required is a reorganization of the process into
modules,</p>
<p>each with its own optimal balance.</p>
<p>Moreover, the relationships between these modules may have to</p>
<p>change whenever product, process, or distribution change.
Switching</p>
<p>from selling heavy equipment to leasing it, for instance, may
dras-</p>
<p>ically change the ratio between finished-product output and
spare-</p>
<p>parts output. Or a fairly minor model change may alter the sequence
in</p>
<p>which major parts are assembled into the finished product. There
is</p>
<p>nothing very new in this, of course. But under the traditional
line</p>
<p>structure, such changes are ignored, or they take forever to
accom-</p>
<p>plish. With competition intensifying and product life cycles
shortening</p>
<p>all the time, such changes cannot be ignored, and they have to be
done</p>
<p>fast. Hence the flotilla’s modular organization.</p>
<p>But this organization requires more than a fairly drastic change
in</p>
<p>he factory’s physical structure. It requires, above all, different
com-</p>
<p>munication and information. In the traditional plant, each sector
and</p>
<p>department reports separately upstairs. And it reports what upstairs
has</p>
<p>asked for. In the factory of 1999, sectors and departments will have
to</p>
<p>hink through what information they owe to whom and what informa-</p>
<p>ion they need from whom. A good deal of this information will
flow</p>
<p>sideways and across department lines, not upstairs. The factory
of</p>
<p>1999 will be an information network.</p>
<p>Consequently, all the managers in a plant will have to know and</p>
<p>understand the entire process, just as the destroyer commander has
to</p>
<p>know and understand the tactical plan of the entire flotilla. In
the</p>
<p>factory of 1999, managers will have to think and act as team
members,</p>
<p>mindful of the performance of the whole. Above all, they will have
to</p>
<p>ask: What do the people running the other modules need to know
about</p>
<p>he characteristics, the capacity, the plans, and the performance of
my</p>
<p>unit? And what, in turn, do we in my module need to know about</p>
<p>heirs?</p>
<p>The Emerging Theory of Manufacturing 243</p>
<p>The last of the new concepts transforming manufacturing is
systems</p>
<p>design, in which the whole of manufacturing is seen as an
integrated</p>
<p>process that converts materials into goods, that is, into
economic</p>
<p>satisfactions.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer, the British retail chain, designed the
first such</p>
<p>system in the 1930s. Marks andandandand Spencer designs and tests the
goods</p>
<p>(whether textiles or foods) it has decided to sell. It designates
one</p>
<p>manufacturer to make each product under contract. It works with
the</p>
<p>manufacturer to produce the right merchandise with the right quality
at</p>
<p>he right price. Finally, it organizes just-in-time delivery of the
fin-</p>
<p>ished products to its stores. The entire process is governed by a</p>
<p>meticulous forecast as to when the goods will move off store
shelves</p>
<p>and into customers’ shopping bags. In the last ten years or so,
such</p>
<p>systems management has become common in retailing.</p>
<p>Though systems organization is still rare in manufacturing, it
was</p>
<p>actually first attempted there. In the early 1920s, when the Model
T</p>
<p>was in its full glory, Henry Ford decided to control the entire
process</p>
<p>of making and moving all the supplies and parts needed by his new</p>
<p>plant, the gigantic River Rouge. He built his own steel mill and
glass</p>
<p>plant. He founded plantations in Brazil to grow rubber for tires.
He</p>
<p>bought the railroad that brought supplies to River Rouge and
carried</p>
<p>away the finished cars. He even toyed with the idea of building
his</p>
<p>own service centers nationwide and staffing them with mechanics</p>
<p>rained in Ford-owned schools. But Ford conceived of all this as a</p>
<p>financial edifice held together by ownership. Instead of building
a</p>
<p>system, he built a conglomerate, an unwieldy monster that was
expen-</p>
<p>sive, unmanageable, and horrendously unprofitable.</p>
<p>In contrast, the new manufacturing system is not “controlled“ at</p>
<p>all. Most of its parts are independent-independent suppliers at
one</p>
<p>end, customers at the other. Nor it is plant centered, as Ford’s
organi-</p>
<p>zation was. The new system sees the plant as little more than a
wide</p>
<p>place in the manufacturing stream. Planning and scheduling start
with</p>
<p>shipment to the final customer, just as they do at Marks andandandand
Spencer.</p>
<p>Delays, halts, and redundancies have to be designed into the
system-</p>
<p>a warehouse here, an extra supply of parts and tools there, a stock
of</p>
<p>old products that are no longer being made but are still
occasionally</p>
<p>demanded by the market. These are necessary imperfections in a</p>
<p>continuous flow that is governed and directed by information.</p>
<p>What has pushed American manufacturers into such systems design</p>
<p>is the trouble they encountered when they copied Japan’s
just-in-time</p>
<p>methods for supplying plants with materials and parts. The
trouble</p>
<p>could have been predicted, for the Japanese scheme is founded in</p>
<p>social and logistic conditions unique to that country and unknown
in</p>
<p>he United States. Yet the shift seemed to American manufacturers
a</p>
<p>matter of procedure, indeed, almost trivial. Company after
company</p>
<p>found, however, that just-in-time delivery of supplies and parts
created</p>
<p>urbulence throughout their plants. And while no one could figure
out</p>
<p>what the problem was, the one thing that became clear was that
with</p>
<p>just-in-time deliveries, the plant no longer functions as a
step-by-step</p>
<p>process that begins at the receiving dock and ends when finished
goods</p>
<p>move into the shipping room. Instead, the plant must be
redesigned</p>
<p>from the end backwards and managed as an integrated flow.</p>
<p>Manufacturing experts, executives, and professors had urged such</p>
<p>an approach for two or three decades now. And some industries,
such</p>
<p>as petroleum refining and large-scale construction, do practice it.
But</p>
<p>by and large, American and European manufacturing plants are
neither</p>
<p>systems designed nor systems managed. In fact, few companies have</p>
<p>enough knowledge about what goes on in their plants to run them
as</p>
<p>systems. Just-in-time delivery, however, forces managers to ask
sys-</p>
<p>ems questions: Where in the plant do we need redundancy? Where</p>
<p>should we place the burden of adjustments? What costs should we
in-</p>
<p>cur in one place to minimize delay, risk, and vulnerability in
another?</p>
<p>A few companies are even beginning to extend the systems concept</p>
<p>of manufacturing beyond the plant and into the marketplace.
Caterpil-</p>
<p>lar, for instance, organizes its manufacturing to supply any
replace-</p>
<p>ment part anywhere in the world within forty-eight hours. But
compa-</p>
<p>nies like this are still exceptions; they must become the rule. As
soon</p>
<p>as we define manufacturing as the process that converts things
into</p>
<p>economic satisfactions, it becomes clear that producing does not
stop</p>
<p>when the product leaves the factory. Physical distribution and
product</p>
<p>service are still part of the production process and should be
integrated</p>
<p>with it, coordinated with it, managed together with it. It is
already</p>
<p>widely recognized that servicing the product must be a major
consid-</p>
<p>eration during its design and production. By 1999, systems
manufac-</p>
<p>uring will have an increasing influence on how we design and
remodel</p>
<p>plants and on how we manage manufacturing businesses.</p>
<p>The Emerging Theory of Manufacturing 245</p>
<p>Traditionally, manufacturing businesses have been organized “in</p>
<p>series,“ with functions such as engineering, manufacturing, and
mar-</p>
<p>keting as successive steps. These days, that system is often
comple-</p>
<p>mented by a parallel team organization (Procter andandandand Gamble’s
product</p>
<p>management teams are a well-known example), which brings various</p>
<p>functions together from the inception of a new product or process</p>
<p>project. If manufacturing is a system, however, every decision in
a</p>
<p>manufacturing business becomes a manufacturing decision. Every</p>
<p>decision should meet manufacturing’s requirements and needs and
in</p>
<p>urn should exploit the strengths and capabilities of a company’s
par-</p>
<p>icular manufacturing system.</p>
<p>When Honda decided six or seven years ago to make a new, upscale</p>
<p>car for the U.S. market, the most heated strategic debate was not
about</p>
<p>design, performance, or price. It was about whether to distribute
the</p>
<p>Acura through Honda’s well-established dealer network or to create
a</p>
<p>new market segment by building separate Acura dealerships at high</p>
<p>cost and risk. This was a marketing issue, of course. But the
decision</p>
<p>was made by a team of design, engineering, manufacturing, and</p>
<p>marketing people. And what tilted the balance toward the separate</p>
<p>dealer network was a manufacturing consideration: the design for</p>
<p>which independent distribution and service made most sense was
the</p>
<p>design that best utilized Honda’s manufacturing capabilities.</p>
<p>Full realization of the systems concept in manufacturing is years</p>
<p>away. It may not require a new Henry Ford. But it will certainly</p>
<p>require very different management and very different managers.
Every</p>
<p>manager in tomorrow’s manufacturing business will have to know
and</p>
<p>understand the manufacturing system. We might well adopt the
Japa-</p>
<p>nese custom of starting all new management people in the plant and
in</p>
<p>manufacturing jobs for the first few years of their careers. Indeed,
we</p>
<p>might go even further and require managers throughout the company
to</p>
<p>rotate into factory assignments throughout their careers-just as
army</p>
<p>officers return regularly to troop duty.</p>
<p>In the new manufacturing business, manufacturing is the
integrator</p>
<p>hat ties everything together. It creates the economic value that
pays</p>
<p>for everything and everybody. Thus the greatest impact of the
manu-</p>
<p>facturing systems concept will not be on the production process.
As</p>
<p>with SQC, its greatest impact will be on social and human
concerns-</p>
<p>on career ladders, for instance, or more important, on the
transforma-</p>
<p>ion of functional managers into business managers, each with a</p>
<p>specific role, but all members of the same production and the
same</p>
<p>cast. And surely, the manufacturing businesses of tomorrow will
not</p>
<p>be run by financial executives, marketers, or lawyers inexperienced
in</p>
<p>manufacturing, as to many U.S. companies are today.</p>
<p>There are important differences among these four concepts.
Consid-</p>
<p>er, for instance, what each means by “the factory.“ In SQC, the</p>
<p>factory is a place where people work. In management accounting
and</p>
<p>he flotilla concept of flexible manufacturing, it is a place where
work</p>
<p>is being done-it makes no difference whether by people, by white</p>
<p>mice, or by robots. In the systems concept, the factory is not a
place at</p>
<p>all; it is a stage in a process that adds economic value to
materials. In</p>
<p>heory, at least, the factory cannot and certainly should not be
de-</p>
<p>signed, let alone built, until the entire process of “making“-all
the</p>
<p>way to the final customer-is understood. Thus defining the factory
is</p>
<p>much more than a theoretical or semantic exercise. It has
immediate</p>
<p>practical consequences on plant design, location, and size; on
what</p>
<p>activities are to be brought together in one manufacturing
complex;</p>
<p>even on how much and in what to invest.</p>
<p>Similarly, each of these concepts reflects a particular mind-set.
To</p>
<p>apply SQC, you don’t have to think, you have to do. Management</p>
<p>accounting concentrates on technical analysis, while the flotilla
fo-</p>
<p>cuses on organization design and work flow. In the systems
concept,</p>
<p>here is great temptation to keep on thinking and never get to the
doing.</p>
<p>Each concept has its own tools, its own language, and addresses</p>
<p>different people.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, what these four concepts have in common is far more</p>
<p>important than their differences. Nowhere is this more apparent than
in</p>
<p>heir assumption that the manufacturing process is a configuration,
a</p>
<p>whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Traditional
approaches</p>
<p>all see the factory as a collection of individual machines and
individual</p>
<p>operations. The nineteenth-century factory was an assemblage of
ma-</p>
<p>chines. Taylor’s scientific management broke up each job into
individ-</p>
<p>ual operations and then put those operations together into new
and</p>
<p>different jobs. “Modem“ twentieth-century concepts-the assembly</p>
<p>line and cost accounting–define performance as the sum of lowest</p>
<p>cost operations. But none of the new concepts is much concerned
with</p>
<p>The Emerging Theory of Manufacturing 247</p>
<p>performance of the parts. Indeed, the parts as such can only
underper-</p>
<p>form. The process produces results.</p>
<p>Management also will reflect this new perspective. SQC is the
most</p>
<p>nearly conventional in its implications for managers, since it does
not</p>
<p>so much change their job as shift much of it to the work force.
But</p>
<p>even managers with no business responsibility (and under SQC,
plant</p>
<p>people have none) will have to manage with an awareness of
business</p>
<p>considerations well beyond the plant. And every manufacturing
man-</p>
<p>ager will be responsible for integrating people, materials,
machines,</p>
<p>and time. Thus every manufacturing manager ten years hence will</p>
<p>have to learn and practice a discipline that integrates
engineering,</p>
<p>management of people, and business economics into the manufactur-</p>
<p>ing process. Quite a few manufacturing people are doing this
already,</p>
<p>of course-though usually unaware that they are doing something
new</p>
<p>and different. Yet such a discipline has not been systematized and
is</p>
<p>still not taught in engineering schools or business schools.</p>
<p>These four concepts are synergistic in the best sense of this
much-</p>
<p>abused term. Together-but only together-they tackle the conflicts</p>
<p>hat have most troubled traditional, twentieth-century
mass-production</p>
<p>plants: the conflicts between people and machines, time and
money,</p>
<p>standardization and flexibility, and functions and systems. The key
is</p>
<p>hat every one of these concepts defines performance as
productivity</p>
<p>and conceives of manufacturing as the physical process that adds</p>
<p>economic value to materials. Each tries to provide economic value in
a</p>
<p>different way. But they share the same theory of manufacturing.</p>
