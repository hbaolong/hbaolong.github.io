<h4 id="managements-role">Management’s Role</h4>
<p>The major assumptions on which both the theory and the practice
of</p>
<p>management have been based these past fifty years are rapidly
becom-</p>
<p>ing inappropriate. A few of these assumptions are actually no
longer</p>
<p>valid and, in fact, are obsolete. Others, while still applicable, are
fast</p>
<p>becoming inadequate; they deal with what is increasingly the
second-</p>
<p>ary, the subordinate, the exceptional, rather than with the primary,
the</p>
<p>dominant, the ruling function and reality of management. Yet most</p>
<p>men of management, practitioners and theoreticians alike, still
take</p>
<p>hese traditional assumptions for granted.</p>
<p>To a considerable extent the obsolescence and inadequacy of these</p>
<p>assumed verities of management reflect management’s own success.</p>
<p>For management has been the success story par excellence of these
last</p>
<p>fifty years-more so even than science. But to an even greater
extent,</p>
<p>he traditional assumptions of management scholar and management</p>
<p>practitioner are being outmoded by independent-or at least only</p>
<p>partially dependent4evelopments in society, in economy, and in
the</p>
<p>world view of our age, especially in the developed countries. To
a</p>
<p>large extent objective reality is changing around the manager-and</p>
<p>fast.</p>
<p>Managers everywhere are very conscious of new concepts and new</p>
<p>ools of management, of new concepts of organization, for instance,
or</p>
<p>of the “information revolution.“ These changes within management</p>
<p>Keynote address given at the 15th CIOS International Management
Congress, Tokyo,</p>
<ol start="1969" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>are indeed of great importance. But more important yet may be the</p>
<p>changes in the basic realities and their impact on the
fundamental</p>
<p>assumptions underlying management as a discipline and as a
practice.</p>
<p>The changes in managerial concepts and tools will force managers
to</p>
<p>change their behavior. The changes in reality demand, however, a</p>
<p>change in the manager’s role. The changes in concepts and tools
means</p>
<p>changes in what a manager does and how he does it. The change in</p>
<p>basic role means a change in what a manager is.</p>
<p>The Old Assumptions</p>
<p>Six assumptions may have formed the foundation of the theory and</p>
<p>practice of management this last half-century. Few practitioners
of</p>
<p>management have, of course, ever been conscious of them. Even the</p>
<p>management scholars have, as a rule, rarely stated them explicitly.
But</p>
<p>both practitioners and theorists alike have accepted these
assumptions,</p>
<p>have, indeed, treated them as self-evident axioms and have based
their</p>
<p>actions, as well as the theories, on them.</p>
<p>These assumptions deal with</p>
<p>he scope,</p>
<p>he task,</p>
<p>he position, and</p>
<p>he nature of management.</p>
<p>Assumption one. Management is management of business, and busi-</p>
<p>ness is unique and the exception in society.</p>
<p>This assumption is held subconsciously rather than in full aware-</p>
<p>ness. It is, however, inescapably implied in the view of society
which</p>
<p>most of us still take for granted whether we are “Right“ or
“Left,“</p>
<p>6’</p>
<p>conservative,“ “liberal, “ or “radical,“ “capitalists“ or “commu-</p>
<p>nists:“ the view of European (French and English) seventeenth-</p>
<p>century social theory which postulates a society in which there is
only</p>
<p>one organized power center, the national government, assumed to
be</p>
<p>sovereign though self-limited, with the rest of society
essentially</p>
<p>composed of the social molecules of individual families. Business,
if</p>
<p>seen at all in this view, is seen as the one exception, the one
organized</p>
<p>Management’s Role 139</p>
<p>institution. Management, therefore, is seen as confined to the
special,</p>
<p>he atypical, the isolated institution of the economic sphere, that
is, to</p>
<p>business enterprise. The nature as well as the characteristics of
man-</p>
<p>agement are, in the traditional view, thus very largely grounded in
the</p>
<p>nature and the characteristics of business activity. One is “for
manage-</p>
<p>ment’’ if one is “for business,“ and vice versa. And somehow, in
this</p>
<p>view, economic activity is quite different from all other human</p>
<p>concerns-to the point where it has become fashionable to speak of</p>
<p>’ ’the economic concern“ as opposed to “human concerns. “</p>
<p>Assumption two. “Social responsibilities“ of management, that is,</p>
<p>concerns that cannot be encompassed within an economic calculus,
are</p>
<p>restraints and limitations imposed on management rather than
manage-</p>
<p>ment objectives and tasks. They are to be discharged largely
without</p>
<p>he enterprise and outside of management’s normal working day. At</p>
<p>he same time and because business is assumed to be the one excep-</p>
<p>ion, only business has social responsibilities; indeed, the
common</p>
<p>phrase is “the social responsibilities of business.“ University,
hospital</p>
<p>and government agencies are clearly not assumed, in the
traditional</p>
<p>view, to have any social responsibilities.</p>
<p>This view derives directly from the belief that business is the
one,</p>
<p>he exceptional institution. University and hospital are not assumed
to</p>
<p>have any social responsibility primarily because they are not within
the</p>
<p>purview of the traditional vision-they are simply not seen at all
as</p>
<p>“organizations.“ Moreover, the traditional view of a social
respon-</p>
<p>sibility peculiar, and confined, to business derives from the
assump-</p>
<p>ions that economic activity differs drastically from other human
activ-</p>
<p>ities (if, indeed, it is even seen as a ‘normal’ human activity), and
that</p>
<p>“profit“ is something extraneous to the economic process and im-</p>
<p>posed on it by the “capitalist“ rather than an intrinsic necessity of
any</p>
<p>economic activity whatever.</p>
<p>Assumption three. The primary, perhaps the only, task of manage-</p>
<p>ment is to mobilize the energies of the business organization for the
ac-</p>
<p>complishment of known and defined tasks. The tests are efficiency
in</p>
<p>doing what is already being done, and adaptation to changes
outside.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship and innovation-ther than systematic research-lie</p>
<p>outside the management scope.</p>
<p>To a large extent this assumption was a necessity during the last</p>
<p>half-century. The new fact then was, after all, not
entrepreneurship</p>
<p>and innovation with which the developed countries had been living
for</p>
<p>several hundred years. The new fact of the world of 1900, when</p>
<p>concern with management first arose, was the large and complex</p>
<p>organization for production and distribution with which the
traditional</p>
<p>managerial systems, whether of workshop or of local store, could
not</p>
<p>cope. The invention of the steam locomotive was not what
triggered</p>
<p>concern with management. Rather it was the emergence, some fifty</p>
<p>years later, of the large railroad company which could handle
steam</p>
<p>locomotives without much trouble but was baffled by the problem
of</p>
<p>coordination between people, of communication between them, and
of</p>
<p>heir authorities and responsibilities.</p>
<p>But the focus on the managerial side of management-to the almost</p>
<p>otal neglect of entrepreneurship as a function of management-also</p>
<p>reflects the reality of the economy in the half-century since World
War</p>
<p>I. It was a period of high technological and entrepreneurial
continuity,</p>
<p>a period that required adaptation rather than innovation, and ability
to</p>
<p>do better rather than courage to do differently.’</p>
<p>The long and hard resistance against management on the part of
the</p>
<p>German Unternehmer or French patron reflects in large measure a</p>
<p>linguistic misunderstanding. There is no German or French word
that</p>
<p>adequately renders management, just as there is no English word
for</p>
<p>entrepreneur (which has remained a foreigner after almost two
hun-</p>
<p>dred years of sojourn in the English-speaking world). In part
this</p>
<p>resistance arises out of peculiarities of economic structure, for
exam-</p>
<p>ple, the role of the commercial banks in Germany which makes the</p>
<p>industrialist concerned for his autonomy stress the “charisma“ of
the</p>
<p>Unternehmer against the impersonal professionalism of the “manag-</p>
<p>er.“ In part also “management“ is classless and derives its
authority</p>
<p>from its objective function rather than, as does German
Unternehmer</p>
<p>or Frenchpatron, from ownership or social class. But surely one of
the</p>
<p>main reasons for ,the resistance against “management“-both as a</p>
<p>erm and as a concept–on the continent of Europe has been the-</p>
<p>Management’s Role 141</p>
<p>largely subconscious-emphasis on the managerial internal task as</p>
<p>against the external, entrepreneurial, innovation function.</p>
<p>Assumption four. It is the manual worker-skilled or unskilled-</p>
<p>who is management’s concern as resource, as a cost center, and as
a</p>
<p>social and individual problem.</p>
<p>To have made the manual worker productive is, indeed, the
greatest</p>
<p>achievement of management to date. Frederick Winslow Taylor’s</p>
<p>“Scientific Management“ is often attacked these days (though
mostly</p>
<p>by people who have not read Taylor). But it was his insistence on</p>
<p>studying work that underlies the affluence of today’s developed
coun-</p>
<p>ries; it raised the productivity of manual work to the point
where</p>
<p>yesterday’s “laborer“-a proletarian condemned to an income at the</p>
<p>margin of subsistence by “the iron law of wages“ and to complete</p>
<p>uncertainty of employment from day to day-has become the “semi-</p>
<p>skilled worker“ of today’s mass-production industries with a
middle-</p>
<p>class standard of living and guaranteed job or income security.
And</p>
<p>Taylor thereby found the way out of the apparently hopeless
impasse</p>
<p>of nineteenth-century “class war“ between the “capitalist
exploita-</p>
<p>ion“ of the laboring man and the “proletarian dictatorship.“</p>
<p>As late as World War 11, the central concern was still the
produc-</p>
<p>ivity and management of manual work; the central achievement of</p>
<p>both the British and the American war economies was the mobiliza-</p>
<p>ion, training, and managing of production workers in large
numbers.</p>
<p>Even in the postwar period one major task-in all developed
countries</p>
<p>other than Great Britain-was the rapid conversion of immigrants
from</p>
<p>he farm into productive manual workers in industry. On this</p>
<p>accomplishment-made possible only because of the ’’Scientific
Man-</p>
<p>agement“ which Taylor pioneered seventy years ago-the economic</p>
<p>growth and performance of Japan, of Western Europe, and even of
the</p>
<p>United States largely rest.</p>
<p>Assumption five. Management is a “science“ or at least a “disci-</p>
<p>pline,“ that is, it is as independent of cultural values and
individual</p>
<p>beliefs as are the elementary operations of arithmetic, the laws
of</p>
<p>physics, or the stress tables of the engineer. But all management
is</p>
<p>being practiced within one distinct national environment and
embed-</p>
<p>ded in one national culture, circumscribed by one legal code and
part</p>
<p>of one national economy.</p>
<p>These two propositions were as obvious to Taylor in the United</p>
<p>States as they were to Fayol in France. Of all the early
management</p>
<p>authorities only Rathenau in Germany seemed to have doubted that</p>
<p>management was an “objective,“ that is, culture-free,
discipline-and</p>
<p>no one listened to him. The Human Relations school attacked
Taylor</p>
<p>as “unscientific;“ they did not attack Taylor’s premise that there
was</p>
<p>an objective “science“ of management. On the contrary, the Human</p>
<p>Relations school proclaimed its findings to be “true“ scientific
psy-</p>
<p>chology and grounded in the “Nature of Man.“ It refused even to
take</p>
<p>into account the findings of its own colleagues in the social
sciences,</p>
<p>he cultural anthropologists. In so far as cultural factors were
consid-</p>
<p>ered at all in the traditional assumptions of management, they
were</p>
<p>“obstacles.“ It is still almost axiomatic in management that social
and</p>
<p>economic development requires the abandonment of
“non-scientific,“</p>
<p>hat is, traditional cultural beliefs, values, and habits. And the
Rus-</p>
<p>sians, for example, in their approach to Chinese development
under</p>
<p>Stalin, differ no whit from the Americans or the Germans in respect
to</p>
<p>his assumption. That, however, the assumption is little but
Western</p>
<p>narrowness and cultural egocentricity, one look at the development
of</p>
<p>Japan would have shown.</p>
<p>At the same time, management theory and practice saw in the</p>
<p>national state and its economy the “natural“ habitat of business</p>
<p>enterprise-as did (and still does), of course, all our political,
legal,</p>
<p>and economic theory.</p>
<p>Assumption six. Management is the result of economic develop-</p>
<p>ment.</p>
<p>This had, of course, been the historical experience in the West</p>
<p>(though not in Japan where the great organizers such as Mitsui,</p>
<p>Iwasaki, Shibusawa, came first, and where economic development,</p>
<p>clearly, was the result of management). But even in the West the</p>
<p>raditional explanation of the emergence of management was largely</p>
<p>myth. As the textbooks had it (and still largely have it),
management</p>
<p>Management’s Role 143</p>
<p>came into being when the small business outgrew the owner who had</p>
<p>done everything himself. In reality, management evolved in enter-</p>
<p>prises that started big and could never have been anything but
big-the</p>
<p>railways in particular, but also the postal service, the steamship
com-</p>
<p>panies, the steel mills, and the department stores. To industries
that</p>
<p>could start small, management came very late; some of those, eg,
the</p>
<p>extile mill or the bank, are still often run on the pattern of the
“one</p>
<p>boss“ who does everything and who, at best, has ‘helpers.’ But
even</p>
<p>where this was seen-and Fay01 as well as Rathenau apparently
real-</p>
<p>ized that management was a function rather than a
stage-management</p>
<p>was seen as a result rather than as a cause, and as a response to
needs</p>
<p>rather than as a creator of opportunity.</p>
<p>I fully realize that I have oversimplified-grossly so. But I do
not</p>
<p>believe that I have misrepresented our traditional assumptions. Nor
do</p>
<p>I believe that I am mistaken that these assumptions, in one form
or</p>
<p>another, still underlie both the theory and the practice of
management,</p>
<p>especially in the industrially developed nations.</p>
<p>And The New Realities</p>
<p>Today, however, we need quite different assumptions. They, too,
of</p>
<p>course, oversimplify-and grossly, too. But they are far closer to</p>
<p>oday’s realities than the assumptions on which theory and practice
of</p>
<p>management have been basing themselves these past fifty years.</p>
<p>Here is a first attempt to formulate assumptions that correspond
to</p>
<p>he management realities of our time.</p>
<p>Assumption one. Every major task of developed society is being</p>
<p>carried out in and through an organized and managed institution.</p>
<p>Business enterprise was only the first of those and, therefore,
became</p>
<p>he prototype by historical accident. But while it has a specific
job-</p>
<p>he production and distribution of economic goods and services-it
is</p>
<p>neither the exception nor unique. Large-scale organization is the
rule</p>
<p>rather than the exception. Our society is one of pluralist
organizations</p>
<p>rather than a diffusion of family units. And management, rather
than</p>
<p>he isolated peculiarity of one unique exception, the business
enter-</p>
<p>prise, is generic and the central social function in our
society.*</p>
<p>A recent amusing book3 points out that management is a form of</p>
<p>government and applies to it Machiavelli’s classic insights. But this
is</p>
<p>really not a very new idea, far from it. It underlay a widely read
book</p>
<p>of 1941-James Burnham’s Managerial Revolution (though Mr. Burn-</p>
<p>ham applied Marx rather than Machiavelli to management). It was</p>
<p>reated in considerable detail in three of my books-The Future of</p>
<p>Industrial Man (1942), Concept of the Corporation (1946)4 and The</p>
<p>New Society (1950). Mr. Justice Brandeis knew this well before
World</p>
<p>War I when he coined the term “Scientific Management“ for Freder-</p>
<p>ick Taylor’s investigations into manual work. That a business
organi-</p>
<p>zation is a form of government was also perfectly obvious to the
entire</p>
<p>radition of American institutional economics from John R. Commons</p>
<p>on, that is, from around the turn of the century. And across the</p>
<p>Atlantic, Walter Rathenau saw the same thing clearly well before</p>
<ol start="1920" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>But what is new is that nonbusiness institutions flock in
increasing</p>
<p>numbers to business management to learn from it how to manage</p>
<p>hemselves. The hospital, the armed services, the Catholic diocese,
the</p>
<p>civil service-all want to go to school for business management.
And</p>
<p>where Britain’s first postwar Labour government nationalized the</p>
<p>Bank of England to prevent its being run like a business, the
next</p>
<p>Labour government hired in 1968 a leading American firm of
manage-</p>
<p>ment consultants (McKinsey andandandand Company) to reorganize the
Bank of</p>
<p>England to make sure it would be managed as a business.</p>
<p>This does not mean that business management can be transferred to</p>
<p>other, nonbusiness institutions. On the contrary, the first thing
these</p>
<p>institutions have to learn from business management is that
manage-</p>
<p>ment begins with the setting of objectives and that, therefore,
non-</p>
<p>economic institutions, such as a university or a hospital, will also
need</p>
<p>very different management from that of a business. But these
institu-</p>
<p>ions are right in seeing in business management the prototype.
What</p>
<p>we have done in respect to the management of a business we
increas-</p>
<p>ingly will have to do for the other institutions, including the
govern-</p>
<p>ment agencies. Business, far from being exceptional, is, in other</p>
<p>words, simply the first of the species and the one we have studied
the</p>
<p>most intensively. And management is generic rather than the
excep-</p>
<p>ion.</p>
<p>Management’s Role 145</p>
<p>Indeed, what has always appeared as the most exceptional charac-</p>
<p>eristic of business management, namely, the measurement of
results</p>
<p>in economic terms, that is, in terms of profitability, now emerges
as</p>
<p>he exemplar of what all institutions need: an objective outside
mea-</p>
<p>surement of the allocation of resources to results and of the
rationality</p>
<p>of managerial decisions. Noneconomic institutions need a
yardstick</p>
<p>hat does for them what profitability does for the business-this
under-</p>
<p>lies the attempt of Robert McNamara, while Secretary of Defense
of</p>
<p>he United States, to introduce “cost-effectiveness“ into the
govern-</p>
<p>ment and to make planned, purposeful, and continuous measurement</p>
<p>of programmes by their results, as compared to their promises and</p>
<p>expectations, the foundation for budget and policy decisions.
“Prof-</p>
<p>itability,“ in other words, rather than being the “exception“ and</p>
<p>distinct from “human“ or “social“ needs, emerges, in the
pluralist</p>
<p>society of organizations, as the prototype of the measurement
needed</p>
<p>by every institution to be managed and manageable.5</p>
<p>Assumption two. Because our society is rapidly becoming a society</p>
<p>of organizations, all institutions, including business, will have to
hold</p>
<p>hemselves accountable for the “quality of life“ and will have to
make</p>
<p>fulfillment of basic social values, beliefs, and purposes a major
objec-</p>
<p>ive of their continuing normal activities rather than a “social
respon-</p>
<p>sibility“ that restrains or that lies outside of their normal main
func-</p>
<p>ions. They will have to learn to make the “quality of life“ into
an</p>
<p>opportunity for their own main tasks. In the business enterprise,
this</p>
<p>means that the attainment of the “quality of life“ increasingly
will</p>
<p>have to be considered a business opportunity and will have to be
con-</p>
<p>verted by management into profitable business.</p>
<p>This will apply increasingly to fulfillment of the individual. It is
the</p>
<p>organization which is today our most visible social environment.
The</p>
<p>family is “private“ rather than “communityv-not that this makes
it</p>
<p>any less important. The “community“ is increasingly in the
organiza-</p>
<p>ion, and especially in the one in which the individual finds his</p>
<p>livelihood and through which he gains access to function,
achieve-</p>
<p>ment, and social status. (On this see my 1949 The New Society</p>
<p>(Reissued as a Transaction book in 199?)It will increasingly be the
job</p>
<p>of management to make the individual’s values and aspirations re-</p>
<p>dound to organizational energy and performance. It will simply not
be</p>
<p>good enough to be satisfied-as Industrial Relations and even
Human</p>
<p>Relations traditionally have been-with “satisfaction,“ that is,
with</p>
<p>he absence of discontent. Perhaps one way to dramatize this is to
say</p>
<p>hat we will, within another ten years, become far less concerned
with</p>
<p>“management development“ as a means of adapting the individual to</p>
<p>he demands of the organization and far more with “organizational</p>
<p>development“ to adapt the organization to the needs, aspirations,
and</p>
<p>potential of the individual.</p>
<p>Assumption three. Entrepreneurial innovation will be as important</p>
<p>o management as the managerial function, both in the developed
and</p>
<p>in the developing countries. Indeed, entrepreneurial innovation may
be</p>
<p>more important in the years to come. Unlike the nineteenth
century,</p>
<p>however, entrepreneurial innovation will increasingly have to be
car-</p>
<p>ried out in and by existing institutions such as existing businesses.
It</p>
<p>will, therefore, no longer be possible to consider it as lying
outside of</p>
<p>management or even as peripheral to management. Entrepreneurial
in-</p>
<p>novation will have to become the very heart and core of
management.</p>
<p>There is every reason to believe that the closing decades of the</p>
<p>wentieth century will see changes as rapid as those that
characterized</p>
<p>he fifty years between 1860 and 1914, when a new major invention</p>
<p>ushering in almost immediately a new major industry with new big</p>
<p>businesses appeared on the scene every two or three years. But
unlike</p>
<p>he last century, these innovations of our century will be as much</p>
<p>social innovations as they will be technical; a metropolis, for
instance,</p>
<p>is clearly as much of a challenge to the innovator today as the
new</p>
<p>science of electricity was to the inventor of 1870. And unlike the
last</p>
<p>century, innovation in this century will be based increasingly on</p>
<p>knowledge of any kind rather than on science alone.</p>
<p>At the same time, innovation will increasingly have to be
channeled</p>
<p>in and through existing businesses, if only because the tax laws
in</p>
<p>every developed country make the existing business the center of</p>
<p>capital accumulation. And innovation is capital-intensive, especially
in</p>
<p>he two crucial phases, the development phase and the market
intro-</p>
<p>duction of new products, processes, or services. We will,
therefore,</p>
<p>increasingly have to learn to make existing organizations capable
of</p>
<p>Management’s Role 147</p>
<p>rapid and continuing innovation. How far we are still from this
is</p>
<p>shown by the fact that management still worries about “resistance
to</p>
<p>change.“ What existing organizations will have to learn is to reach
out</p>
<p>for change as an opportunity and to resist continuity.</p>
<p>Assumption four. A primary task of management in the developed</p>
<p>countries in the decades ahead will increasingly be to make
knowledge</p>
<p>productive. The manual worker is “yesterday“-and all we can fight</p>
<p>on that front is a rearguard action. The basic capital resource,
the</p>
<p>fundamental investment, but also the cost center of a developed
econ-</p>
<p>omy, is the knowledge worker who puts to work what he has learned
in</p>
<p>systematic education, that is, concepts, ideas, and theories, rather
than</p>
<p>he man who puts to work manual skill or muscle.</p>
<p>Taylor put knowledge to work to make the manual worker produc-</p>
<p>ive. But Taylor himself never asked the question, ’What
constitutes</p>
<p>“productivity“ in respect to the industrial engineer who applies
“Sci-</p>
<p>entific Management“? As a result of Taylor’s work, we can answer</p>
<p>what productivity is in respect to the manual worker. But we
still</p>
<p>cannot answer what productivity is in respect to the industrial
engi-</p>
<p>neer, or to any other knowledge worker. Surely the measurements</p>
<p>which give us productivity for the manual worker, such as the
number</p>
<p>of pieces turned out per hour or per dollar of wage, are quite
irrelevant</p>
<p>if applied to the knowledge worker. There are few things as
useless</p>
<p>and unproductive as the engineering department which with great</p>
<p>dispatch, industry, and elegance turns out the drawings for an
unsal-</p>
<p>able product. Productivity in respect to the knowledge worker is,
in</p>
<p>other words, primarily quality. We cannot even define it yet.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: to make knowledge productive will bring about</p>
<p>changes in job structure, careers, and organizations as drastic as
those</p>
<p>which resulted in the factory from the application of Scientific
Man-</p>
<p>agement to manual work. The entrance job, above all, will have to
be</p>
<p>changed drastically to enable the knowledge worker to become
produc-</p>
<p>ive. For it is abundantly clear that knowledge cannot be
productive</p>
<p>unless the knowledge worker finds out who he himself is, what kind
of</p>
<p>work he is fitted for, and how he best works. In other words, there
can</p>
<p>be no divorce of “planning“ from “doing“ in knowledge work. On</p>
<p>he contrary, the knowledge worker must be able to “plan“ himself.</p>
<p>And this the present entrance jobs, by and large, do not make
possible.</p>
<p>They are based on the assumption-valid for manual work but quite</p>
<p>inappropriate to knowledge work-that an outsider can objectively</p>
<p>determine the “one best way“ for any kind of work. For knowledge</p>
<p>work, this is simply not true. There may be “one best way,“ but it
is</p>
<p>heavily conditioned by the individual and not entirely determined
by</p>
<p>physical, or even by mental, characteristics of the job. It is
tempera-</p>
<p>mental as well.</p>
<p>Assumptionfive. There are management tools and techniques. There</p>
<p>are management concepts and principles. There is a common
language</p>
<p>of management. And there may even be a universal “discipline“ of</p>
<p>management. Certainly there is a worldwide generic function which</p>
<p>we call management and which serves the same purpose in any and
all</p>
<p>developed societies. But management is also a culture and a system
of</p>
<p>values and beliefs. It is also the means through which a given
society</p>
<p>makes productive its own values and beliefs. Indeed, management</p>
<p>may well be considered the bridge between a “civilization“ that
is</p>
<p>rapidly becoming worldwide, and a “culture“ which express diver-</p>
<p>gent traditions, values, beliefs, and heritages. Management must,
in-</p>
<p>deed, become the instrument through which cultural diversity can
be</p>
<p>made to serve the common purposes of mankind. At the same time,</p>
<p>management increasingly is not being practiced within the confines
of</p>
<p>one national culture, law, or sovereignty but “multinationally .“
In-</p>
<p>deed, management increasingly is becoming an institution-so far,
the</p>
<p>only o n e - o f a genuine world economy.</p>
<p>Management we now know has to make productive values, aspira-</p>
<p>ions, and traditions of individuals, community, and society for a</p>
<p>common productive purpose. If management, in other words, does
not</p>
<p>succeed in putting to work the specific cultural heritage of a
country</p>
<p>and of a people, social and economic development cannot take
place.</p>
<p>This is, of course, the great lesson of Japan-and the fact that
Japan</p>
<p>succeeded, a century ago, in putting to work her own traditions
of</p>
<p>community and human values for the new ends of a modern indus-</p>
<p>rialized state explains why Japan succeeded while every other
non-</p>
<p>Western country has so far failed. Management, in other words,
will</p>
<p>have to be considered both a science and a humanity, both a
statement</p>
<p>Management’s Role 149</p>
<p>of findings that can be objectively tested and validated and a system
of</p>
<p>belief and experience.</p>
<p>At the same time, management-and here we speak of business</p>
<p>management alone, so far-is rapidly emerging as the one and only</p>
<p>institution that is common and transcends the boundaries of the
nation-</p>
<p>al state. The multi-national corporation does not really exist so
far.</p>
<p>What we have, by and large, are still businesses that are based on
one</p>
<p>country with one culture and, heavily, one nationality, especially
in</p>
<p>op management. But it is also becoming clear that this is a
transition</p>
<p>phenomenon and that continuing development of the world economy</p>
<p>both requires and leads to genuinely multinational companies in
which</p>
<p>not only production and sales are multinational, but ownership
and</p>
<p>management as well-all the way from the top down.</p>
<p>Within the individual country, especially the developed country,</p>
<p>business is rapidly losing its exceptional status as we recognize
that it</p>
<p>is the prototype of the typical, indeed, the universal, social form,
the</p>
<p>organized institution requiring management. Beyond the national</p>
<p>boundary, however, business is rapidly acquiring the same
exceptional</p>
<p>status it no longer has within the individual developed country.
Be-</p>
<p>yond the national boundary, business is rapidly becoming the
unique,</p>
<p>he exceptional, the one institution which expresses the reality of
a</p>
<p>world economy and of a worldwide knowledge society.</p>
<p>Assumption six. Management creates economic and social develop-</p>
<p>ment. Economic and social development is the result of
management.</p>
<p>It can be said without too much oversimplification that there are
no</p>
<p>“underdeveloped countries. “ There are only “undermanaged“ ones.</p>
<p>Japan a hundred years ago was an underdeveloped country by every</p>
<p>material measurement. But it very quickly produced management of</p>
<p>great competence, indeed, of excellence. Within twenty-five years</p>
<p>Meiji Japan had become a developed country, and, indeed, in some</p>
<p>aspects, such as literacy, the most highly developed of all
countries.</p>
<p>We realize today that it is Meiji Japan, rather than
eighteenth-century</p>
<p>England-r even nineteenth-century Germany-which has to be the</p>
<p>model of development for the underdeveloped world. This means
that</p>
<p>management is the prime mover and that development is a conse-</p>
<p>quence.</p>
<p>All our experience in economic development proves this. Wherever</p>
<p>we have only contributed the economic ‘factor of production,’
espe-</p>
<p>cially capital, we have not achieved development. In the few
cases</p>
<p>where we have been able to generate management energies (e.g., in</p>
<p>he Cauca Valley in Colombia6)we have generated rapid development.</p>
<p>Development, in other words, is a matter of human energies rather</p>
<p>han of economic wealth. And the generation and direction of human</p>
<p>energies is the task of management.</p>
<p>Admittedly, these new assumptions oversimplify; they are meant
to.</p>
<p>But I submit that they are better guides to effective management in
the</p>
<p>developed countries today, let alone tomorrow, than the
assumptions</p>
<p>on which we have based our theories as well as our practice these
last</p>
<p>fifty years. We are not going to abandon the old tasks. We still,</p>
<p>obviously, have to manage the going enterprise and have to create</p>
<p>internal order and organization. We still have to manage the
manual</p>
<p>worker and make him productive. And no one who knows the reality</p>
<p>of management is likely to assert that we know everything in these
and</p>
<p>similar areas that we need to know; far from it. But the big jobs
waiting</p>
<p>for management today, the big tasks requiring both new theory and</p>
<p>new practice, arise out of the new realities and demand different</p>
<p>assumptions and different approaches.</p>
<p>More important even than the new tasks, however, may be manage-</p>
<p>ment’s new role. Management is fast becoming the central resource
of</p>
<p>he developed countries and the basic need of the developing ones.</p>
<p>From being the specific concern of one, the economic institutions
of</p>
<p>society, management and managers are becoming the generic, the</p>
<p>distinctive, the constitutive organs of developed society. What
man-</p>
<p>agement is and what managers do will, therefore-and properly-</p>
<p>become increasingly a matter of public concern rather than a matter
for</p>
<p>he “experts.“ Management will increasingly be concerned as much</p>
<p>with the expression of basic beliefs and values as with the
accomplish-</p>
<p>ment of measurable results. It will increasingly stand for the
quality of</p>
<p>life of a society as much as for its standard of living.</p>
<p>There are many new tools of management the use of which we will</p>
<p>have to learn, and many new techniques. There are, as this paper</p>
<p>points out, a great many new and difficult tasks. But the most
impor-</p>
<p>Management’s Role 151</p>
<p>ant change ahead for management is that increasingly the
aspirations,</p>
<p>he values, indeed, the very survival of society in the developed</p>
<p>countries will come to depend on the performance, the competence,</p>
<p>he earnestness and the values of their managers. The task of the
next</p>
<p>generation is to make productive for individual, community, and</p>
<p>society the new organized institutions of our New Pluralism. And
that</p>
<p>is, above all, the task of management.</p>
