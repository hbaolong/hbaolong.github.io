<h4 id="misinterpreting-japan-and-the-japanese">Misinterpreting Japan
and the Japanese</h4>
<p>For forty years I’ve been trying to explain to my American
friends</p>
<p>hat they misinterpret Japan. I haven’t made much progress. The
first</p>
<p>challenge is explaining what any Japanese civil servant
understands</p>
<p>perfectly well: despite the country’s economic miracle since
World</p>
<p>War 11, Japan has not had an economic policy; it has had a social</p>
<p>policy.</p>
<p>When I first started to work with the Japanese government and</p>
<p>Japanese businesses in the early 1950s, Japan was not only a war-</p>
<p>ravaged country, but an incredibly fragile society. Half the
people</p>
<p>lived on the land, and there was an exceedingly high number of
small</p>
<p>shopkeepers and small factories with a few dozen employees and
pre-</p>
<p>World War I machinery.</p>
<p>The policy Japan adopted at that time was to avoid taking any
social</p>
<p>risks-to protect domestic society, especially domestic
employment,</p>
<p>and at the same time to push a few carefully groomed industries
into</p>
<p>export opportunities. Nobody then believed that Japanese exports</p>
<p>would ever earn enough foreign currency to pay for the imported
food</p>
<p>and raw materials on which the island country depends.</p>
<p>Japan today remains the world’s largest importer of food and com-</p>
<p>modities. But the basic social, demographic, and economic founda-</p>
<p>ions of the past forty years are quickly shifting. Today, of the tens
of</p>
<p>housands of small shops in Japan, many are franchises of large
chains</p>
<p>First published in the Wall Street Journal, 1990</p>
<p>such as 7-Eleven and Kentucky Fried Chicken. Only about 5 percent
of</p>
<p>he population now makes its living as farmers.</p>
<p>The new largest single group, though not the majority yet, is
people</p>
<p>who did not even exist in 1954: educated, middle-class, salaried</p>
<p>employees. They are up for grabs politically. In the last election
they</p>
<p>still voted for the Liberal Democrats, not because they have any use
for</p>
<p>hem, but because the opposition is even less credible. For the next
ten</p>
<p>o twenty years, the big political and economic challenge in Japan
will</p>
<p>be to find the new consensus. The need for policies to protect
Japanese</p>
<p>society is gone, and in fact those policies are becoming
increasingly</p>
<p>unpopular among consumers, as the new dominant groups do not feel</p>
<p>any need to be protected. What is now needed is a truly economic</p>
<p>policy.</p>
<p>Without understanding the fundamental changes that are reshaping</p>
<p>Japan, Americans cannot hope to make sense of the United States’</p>
<p>much lamented trade deficit with that country–or know whether the</p>
<p>Japanese indeed pose the economic threat to the United States
that</p>
<p>some people in Washington would have us believe.</p>
<p>For all the headlines about Japan’s trade surplus, I do not know
a</p>
<p>single Japanese in a responsible government or academic position
who</p>
<p>believes in it. The export surplus is a mirage. It exists on paper,
but</p>
<p>nowhere else.</p>
<p>To be sure, a good many of our industries are lagging behind the</p>
<p>Japanese. But the United States’ trade deficit with Japan has
almost</p>
<p>nothing to do with manufacturing, great though Japan’s own
industrial</p>
<p>prowess may be. The Japanese trade surplus is largely the result of
low</p>
<p>prices in the raw materials and food that Japan imports.</p>
<p>There has been a glut of petroleum for nearly a decade, to the
delight</p>
<p>of Japan, which imports all of its oil. In the developed nations,
farm</p>
<p>productivity has increased dramatically in the last forty years. At
the</p>
<p>same time, food consumption is not going up. As people become</p>
<p>affluent, they do not eat more; in fact, they buy magazines that
tell</p>
<p>hem how to eat less.</p>
<p>The Japanese have also benefited because food and commodities,</p>
<p>with their low prices, are traded in dollars. And since 1985 the
dollar</p>
<p>has been devalued-at times by as much as half-against the yen. As
a</p>
<p>result of these various factors, the Japanese pay little more than
one-</p>
<p>Misinterpreting Japan and the Japanese 413</p>
<p>hird of what might be considered the “normal“ value of the food
and</p>
<p>raw materials they import.</p>
<p>Yet from the Japanese point of view, if prices ever go up, Japan
will</p>
<p>have difficulty earning enough through foreign exchange to pay
for</p>
<p>hese imports. And there is a very good chance that in the next
few</p>
<p>years-not forever, but for a while-world food prices will
skyrocket.</p>
<p>Where is the food going to come from to feed Eastern Europe,
where</p>
<p>he food shortage is already great and growing day by day?</p>
<p>As we feed the declining Soviet empire, the food surpluses of the</p>
<p>free world will diminish over the next five years. And the
Japanese,</p>
<p>quite rightly, see the need for a policy that is based on
maintaining</p>
<p>heir present export surplus. Maybe food prices will stay low.
Maybe</p>
<p>petroleum will stay affordable. But what if not? That is Japan’s</p>
<p>nagging fear.</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding totally absurd, I’ve always considered</p>
<p>Japanese-American trade negotiations Punch-and-Judy shows. Anyone</p>
<p>who thinks the Japanese do not buy foreign goods need only go
into</p>
<p>any Tokyo shop. You will see nothing but foreign brand names-they</p>
<p>just happen to be made in Japan. Does anyone seriously think that
IBM</p>
<p>is going to ship computers to Japan when IBM Japan controls 40</p>
<p>percent of the Japanese market and is one of the most profitable
parts</p>
<p>of IBM? Or that Coca-Cola is going to ship anything to Japan?</p>
<p>And so I’ve never seen that mythical great, untapped Japanese</p>
<p>market. When I sit down with my sharp pencil and try to figure
out</p>
<p>how much more Japan is likely to buy-with its American trade</p>
<p>surplus of 0 billion a year-I come up with a maximum of</p>
<p>billion.</p>
<p>We are so hypnotized by the trade surplus that we do not
understand</p>
<p>how dependent upon the United States Japan has become. In
economic</p>
<p>history, the point at which a nation’s dependence on one market</p>
<p>becomes economically and politically dangerous is somewhere
around</p>
<p>25 percent. Japan has surpassed that point with the United
States,</p>
<p>which buys more than 40 percent of Japanese exports.</p>
<p>Now, if you have a 0 billion trade surplus, you may be able to</p>
<p>ake a small portion home in goods. But what do you do with the
rest</p>
<p>of the money–dump it in the ocean? You must invest.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese know that there is tremendous political risk
in</p>
<p>buying American real assets-movie companies, Manhattan land-</p>
<p>marks and so on-United States Treasury bills are almost the only</p>
<p>hing they can buy. And here, we have them over a barrel. Were
they</p>
<p>o pull out their money, as so many people seem to fear, there
would</p>
<p>be a run on the market and the dollar might go down to 100 to the
yen,</p>
<p>which penalizes only the Japanese.</p>
<p>We might not feel the effects at all, but the Japanese would lose a
lot</p>
<p>of dough. As the old saw goes, if you owe your bank 0,000, the</p>
<p>bank owns you. If you owe the bank million, you own the bank. In</p>
<p>his sense, the United States owns Japan; or, at least, the Japanese
are</p>
<p>much more dependent upon this country than they would like to be.</p>
<p>Last year Sony’s chairman, Akio Morita, and a former cabinet</p>
<p>minister and nationalist politician, Shintaro Ishihara, irritated
many</p>
<p>Americans with a book published in Japan, The Japan That Can Say</p>
<p>No. The premise was that Japan’s supposed technological
superiority</p>
<p>has made the United States dependent on the Japanese.</p>
<p>One of the most publicized examples was that if Japan stopped</p>
<p>shipping one particular microchip to this country, we would have
to</p>
<p>stop making a major missile. In fact, most of the microchips for
this</p>
<p>missile are made here, and it would take us about six weeks to get
the</p>
<p>rest, if the Japanese cut us off. We know how to make chips. It is
a</p>
<p>matter of price, not of technical capability.</p>
<p>The same politician, Shintaro Ishihara, recognized the danger of</p>
<p>single-market dependence during the 1960s and said, in effect,
that</p>
<p>Japan needed an outrigger on the left side, to balance its canoe on
the</p>
<p>right. He is the man who began to beat the drum for Japanese
invest-</p>
<p>ment in China, and it has been a total disaster-not for political,
but</p>
<p>for economic reasons.</p>
<p>Some of us tried to tell him that no underdeveloped country has
ever</p>
<p>been a satisfactory market for the goods of a developed one. The
first</p>
<p>country to learn this was Great Britain in respect to India in
the</p>
<p>nineteenth century. Ishihara did not want to hear it, but it has
turned</p>
<p>out to be true. Toyota, for example, shipped 6,032 vehicles to
China</p>
<p>last year; the company shipped more than twice that number each
week</p>
<p>o the United States.</p>
<p>In looking to Europe as another possible outlet, the Japanese see</p>
<p>major obstacles. The industries in which the Japanese are strongest
are</p>
<p>he ones in which Europe has the most overcapacity and incredible</p>
<p>Misinterpreting Japan and the Japanese 415</p>
<p>overemployment. Not counting Eastern Europe, there are still almost
a</p>
<p>million people too many in the European steel industry. The auto-</p>
<p>mobile and consumer electronics industries also have far more
capacity</p>
<p>han demand for products. And so, in a period when the European</p>
<p>market is rapidly integrating, the Japanese are viewed as a
tremendous</p>
<p>external threat.</p>
<p>How are the Japanese to integrate themselves into the world econ-</p>
<p>omy in which-because of domestic political changes and external</p>
<p>forces-they can no longer pursue the strategies of the past forty</p>
<p>years? The need to protect society in Japan is gone, and is in
fact</p>
<p>meeting stiff resistance from Japanese importers. Pushing more
ex-</p>
<p>ports to the West is no longer a viable option.</p>
<p>Is it necessary to try to form an East Asian bloc? And how does
one</p>
<p>do this with countries of such incredibly uneven social and
economic</p>
<p>development as, let’s say, Japan and Thailand? And can it be done</p>
<p>without the coastal cities of China? And is Southeast Asia likely
to</p>
<p>allow itself to become dependent on Japan, considering the
chilling</p>
<p>memories of the 1930s that are still very much alive in China,
Korea,</p>
<p>Indonesia and Thailand?</p>
<p>If China breaks up again into regions controlled by economic war-</p>
<p>lords, which cannot be ruled out, then we could see an East Asian
bloc</p>
<p>organized around Japan. It wouldn’t be easy, in view of the
tension</p>
<p>between those two cultures and two peoples, but I think
Ishihara’s</p>
<p>China card might nevertheless finally come into play. So long as
there</p>
<p>remains a unified Communist China, however, Japan must look west-</p>
<p>ward.</p>
<p>A very drastic course would be for Japan to shift 180 degrees and</p>
<p>become the leader of “freer“ trade–do not call it free trade; no
such</p>
<p>hing exists except in textbooks-and enlist the United States in
trying</p>
<p>o prevent European-imposed protectionism. Japanese society could</p>
<p>adjust to that.</p>
<p>It would basically require Japan to forget forty years in which
the</p>
<p>fundamental policy was to never take a social risk or expose
protected</p>
<p>industries to the risk of competition. If you are one of the
major</p>
<p>corporations such as Sony or Toshiba or Toyota that has proved
its</p>
<p>ability to compete in the world market, you may be willing to take
such</p>
<p>a risk; it may be the only way you can maintain access to the
American</p>
<p>market and gain access to Europe.</p>
<p>One thing you can count on with the Japanese: behind the policy
of</p>
<p>“take it easy, one step at a time,“ there is furious, hard thinking
going</p>
<p>on. Nobody in the world is as good at making decisions as the</p>
<p>Japanese.</p>
