<h4 id="behind-japans-success">Behind Japan’s Success</h4>
<p>“I am more afraid of the Japanese than I am of the Russians,“ a</p>
<p>young lawyer, partner in a leading law firm, said recently to me.
“To</p>
<p>be sure, the Russians are out to conquer the world. But their unity
is</p>
<p>imposed from the top and is unlikely to survive a challenge. The</p>
<p>Japanese too are out to conquer us, and their unity comes from
within.</p>
<p>They act as one superconglomerate.“ But this is myth rather than</p>
<p>reality. The Japanese indeed have learned how to act in the world</p>
<p>economy effectively and with national consensus behind their
policies.</p>
<p>But their unity is not the result of a “Japan Inc.,“ of a monolith
of</p>
<p>hought and action. It is the result of something far more
interesting</p>
<p>and perhaps far more important: of policies aimed at using
conflict,</p>
<p>diversity, dissent to produce effective policy and effective
action.</p>
<p>To any Japanese, “Japan Inc.“ is a joke, and not a very funny
one.</p>
<p>He sees only cracks and not, as the foreigner does, a “monolith.“</p>
<p>What he experiences in his daily life and work are tensions,
pressures,</p>
<p>and conflicts rather than “harmony.“ There is, for instance, the</p>
<p>intense, if not cutthroat competition between the major banks and</p>
<p>between the major industrial groups. And almost every Japanese is</p>
<p>himself involved personally every day in the bitter factional
infighting</p>
<p>which-rather than unity and cooperation-characterize~ Japanese
in-</p>
<p>stitutions: the unremitting guerrilla warfare which each ministry
wages</p>
<p>against all other ministries; the factional sniping and bickering
within</p>
<p>he political parties and within the Cabinet, but also within each</p>
<p>First published in Harvard Business Review, 1981.</p>
<p>business and each university. Where the foreigner sees close
coopera-</p>
<p>ion between government and business, the Japanese businessman
sees</p>
<p>government attempts to meddle and to dictate, and a constant
tug-of-</p>
<p>war. “To be sure,“ the chief executive officer of a big company</p>
<p>remarks, “we pull at the same rope, but we pull in opposite
direc-</p>
<p>ions.“ Nor is government always successful in making industry
work</p>
<p>ogether and subordinate itself to what government sees as the
national</p>
<p>interest. Despite twenty years of continuous pressure, the
supposedly</p>
<p>all-powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
has,</p>
<p>for instance, not gotten the major Japanese computer manufacturers
to</p>
<p>pool their efforts-something that Germany, France, and Britain
have</p>
<p>all accomplished.</p>
<p>One foreigner after another extols Japan’s uniquely harmonious</p>
<p>industrial relations. But the Japanese public curses at the
all-too-</p>
<p>common wildcat strikes on the government-owned National Railways.</p>
<p>It is only where the labor unions are exceedingly weak, that is, in
the</p>
<p>private sector, that labor relations are harmonious. There is no sign
of</p>
<p>“harmony“ in the public sector, where (a legacy of the U.S.
occupa-</p>
<p>ion) unions are strong. Indeed, Japanese labor leaders are inclined
to</p>
<p>point out, somewhat acidly, that Western firms without
unions-IBM,</p>
<p>for instance-tend to have exactly the same labor policies and the
same</p>
<p>“harmony“ as “Japan Inc. ,“ so that the Japanese situation
signifies</p>
<p>management’s hostility to unions rather than the fabled “harmony.
“</p>
<p>And yet-while “Japan Inc.“ may be more myth than reality, Japan</p>
<p>has developed habits of political behavior which make it
singularly</p>
<p>effective as a nation in economic policy and in international
economic</p>
<p>competition. One of these habits is thorough consideration of a
pro-</p>
<p>posed policy’s impact on the productivity of Japanese industry,
on</p>
<p>Japan’s competitive strength in the world markets, and on Japan’s</p>
<p>balances of payment and of trade. This has become almost second</p>
<p>nature with Japanese policymakers, whether in the ministries, in
the</p>
<p>Diet, or in business, and equally with analysts and critics in
the</p>
<p>popular newspapers or the university economics departments. The</p>
<p>Japanese are far too conscious of their dependence on imports for
the</p>
<p>bulk of their energy and of their raw materials and for two fifths
of</p>
<p>heir food to shrug off the external world or to push it out of their
field</p>
<p>of vision altogether, as American lawmakers, American government</p>
<p>Behind Japan’s Success 399</p>
<p>departments, and so many American economists are wont to do.</p>
<p>The Japanese do not go in for formal “productivity impact state-</p>
<p>ments.“ And its impact on competitive position and productivity is
by</p>
<p>no means the sole criterion in adopting or rejecting a proposed
policy.</p>
<p>Even if the most powerful government agency opposes a policy be-</p>
<p>cause of its deleterious impacts on Japan’s position in the world</p>
<p>economy, the Japanese public or Japanese industry may yet embrace</p>
<p>it-as they did in respect to the expansion of the Japanese
automobile</p>
<p>industry.</p>
<p>MITI, the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry</p>
<p>has, since 1960 and 1961, steadily opposed expansion of the auto-</p>
<p>mobile industry-in large part because it views the private
automobile</p>
<p>as “self-indulgence“ and as the opening wedge of the “consumer</p>
<p>society“ which a puritanical MITI abhors. There was also, at least
in</p>
<p>he early years, considerable skepticism about the ability of
untried</p>
<p>Japanese automobile manufacturers to compete against the likes of</p>
<p>GM, Ford, Fiat, and Volkswagen. And there was, and is, great fear</p>
<p>hat a large automobile market in Japan will provoke irresistible
de-</p>
<p>mands to open Japan to foreign imports-the one thing MITI is</p>
<p>determined to prevent. But MITI also held-and quite
sincerely-that</p>
<p>expansion of the automobile industry would have an adverse, indeed
a</p>
<p>deleterious, effect on Japan’s balance of trade, on its ability to
earn its</p>
<p>way in the world economy, and on its productivity altogether. The</p>
<p>more successful the Japanese automobile industry, MITI economists</p>
<p>argued, the worse the impacts on Japan. The automobile, they
pointed</p>
<p>out, requires the two raw materials that are in shortest supply in
Japan:</p>
<p>petroleum and iron ore. It also requires diversion of scarce
resources,</p>
<p>both of food-growing land and of capital, to highways and highway</p>
<p>construction. What MITI wanted was massive investment to upgrade</p>
<p>he railroads’ freight-handling capacity.</p>
<p>There are plenty of diehards around-and not only at MITI-who</p>
<p>still maintain that to let the Japanese automobile industry expand
was a</p>
<p>serious mistake. The industry’s export earnings, the diehards
will</p>
<p>argue, are only a fraction of what the automobile costs Japan in
foreign</p>
<p>exchange for petroleum and iron ore imports, even with record
auto-</p>
<p>mobile sales to North America and Western Europe. A small part of</p>
<p>he sums spent on highways would have given the Japanese railroads</p>
<p>he freight-carrying capacity which the country needs and still
lacks.</p>
<p>Yet, though enormous amounts have been spent on roads, it has not</p>
<p>been nearly enough to build an adequate highway system-thus
result-</p>
<p>ing in trucks clogging the inadequate roads, in high
transportation</p>
<p>costs for Japanese industry, in unhealthy concentration of people
and</p>
<p>factories around a few already overcrowded port cities such as
Tokyo,</p>
<p>Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, and Fukuoka, and in growing air pollu-</p>
<p>ion.</p>
<p>MITI lost its fight against the automobile, despite its reputation as
a</p>
<p>kind of economic superman. It was defeated in part by the
automobile</p>
<p>industry, which forged ahead despite MITI’s disapproval. In large
part</p>
<p>MITI was defeated by the infatuation of “Nabe-san,“ the Japanese</p>
<p>“man in the street“ (and of his wife) with the motor car, despite
its</p>
<p>high costs, despite the lack of places to park, despite the traffic
jams</p>
<p>which make commuting a nightmare in every Japanese city, and</p>
<p>despite air pollution, about which no one complains louder than</p>
<p>“Nabe-san,“ sitting in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>But at least-and this is the point-the automobile’s impact on</p>
<p>Japan’s productivity, competitive position, and balance of trade
was</p>
<p>seriously considered. And even the automobile company executives</p>
<p>who fought MITI the hardest admit that it was the ministry’s duty
to</p>
<p>make sure that these impacts were taken seriously, no matter how</p>
<p>popular “wheels“ are with the Japanese consumer and voter.</p>
<p>The impact on Japan’s competitive position in the world economy
is</p>
<p>only one of the considerations Japanese leaders are expected to
think</p>
<p>hrough and weigh carefully before espousing a policy or taking a</p>
<p>course of action. They are expected altogether to start out with
the</p>
<p>question: “What is good for the country?“ rather than the
question:</p>
<p>“What is good for us, our institution, our members and
constituents?“</p>
<p>In no other country are interest groups so well organized as in
Japan,</p>
<p>with its endless array of economic federations, industry
associations,</p>
<p>professional societies, trade groups, special interest “clubs,“
guilds,</p>
<p>and what-have-you. Each of these groups lobbies brazenly and
openly</p>
<p>uses its voting power and its money to advance its own selfish ends
in</p>
<p>ways that would have made a Tammany boss blush. Yet if it wants
to</p>
<p>be listened to and to have influence on the policymaking process,</p>
<p>every group must start out in its thinking and in its deliberations
with</p>
<p>he national interest rather than with its own concerns. It is not</p>
<p>Behind Japan’s Success 401</p>
<p>expected to be “unselfish“ and to advocate policies that might cost
it</p>
<p>money, power, or votes-Japan’s Confucian tradition rather
distrusts</p>
<p>self-sacrifice as unnatural. But the group is expected to fit what
serves</p>
<p>self-interest into a framework of national needs, national goals,
nation-</p>
<p>al aspirations and values. Sometimes this is blatant hypocrisy, as
when</p>
<p>he Japanese physicians claim that the only thought behind their
suc-</p>
<p>cessful demand for near-total exemption from taxes is concern for
the</p>
<p>nation’s health. Still, the physicians pay lip service to the rule
which</p>
<p>demands that the question, “What is the national interest?“ be
asked</p>
<p>first. That it fails to do even that and instead is forced by the
very logic</p>
<p>of trade unionism to assert that “What is good for labor is ipso
facto</p>
<p>good for the country,“ is probably largely responsible for the
Japanese</p>
<p>union’s lack of political influence and public acceptance, despite
the</p>
<p>union’s impressive numbers. And that, conversely, business
manage-</p>
<p>ment in Japan–or at least a substantial minority among business</p>
<p>leaders-has for a hundred years subscribed to the rule that the
nation-</p>
<p>al interest comes first, that indeed the rule was first formulated by
one</p>
<p>of the earliest of modem Japanese business leaders, the
nineteenth-</p>
<p>century entrepreneur, banker, and business philosopher Eiichi
Shi-</p>
<p>buzawa (1840- 193l), may also explain why business management is</p>
<p>respectfully listened to whenever it discusses economic and
social</p>
<p>policies, even by the two fifths of the Japanese population who
faith-</p>
<p>fully vote every time for avowedly Marxist and stridently
anti-business</p>
<p>parties and candidates.</p>
<p>The demand that they take responsibility for thinking through the</p>
<p>policies which the national interest requires forces the
leadership</p>
<p>groups-and especially the business leaders-to lead. It demands
that</p>
<p>hey take the initiative and formulate, propound, and advocate
national</p>
<p>policies before they become issues. Indeed, it forces the
leadership</p>
<p>groups to define what the proper issues are and should be.</p>
<p>In the West, and especially in the United States, the
“interests“-</p>
<p>such as the conventional “interests“ in the economic sphere:
business,</p>
<p>labor, and the farmer-are expected to start out with their own
con-</p>
<p>cerns and their own needs and wants. This then means as a rule
that</p>
<p>hey can rarely act at all in any matter that is general rather
than</p>
<p>sectional. They can only react. They cannot lead; they can only
oppose</p>
<p>what someone else proposes. For whenever a matter of general con-</p>
<p>cern comes up, someone within the group is bound to fear being</p>
<p>harmed, someone else will be opposed to doing anything at all, and
a</p>
<p>hird will drag his feet. In Japan too, of course, any proposal is
likely</p>
<p>o run into opposition within any group. But the special interests
and</p>
<p>concerns of the members of the group which form the starting point
for</p>
<p>policy deliberations in the West are pushed aside in Japan until
the</p>
<p>national interest has been thought through. In the West, the
individual,</p>
<p>sectional, specific interests and concerns are the focus; in Japan,
they</p>
<p>are the qualifiers. The Western approach tends to lead to
inaction–or</p>
<p>o “another study“-until someone from the outside proposes a law
or</p>
<p>a regulation that can then be fought as “unacceptable.“ But this
is</p>
<p>only rearguard action to prevent defeat or to contain damage and,
even</p>
<p>worse, the other side then determines what the issues are or should
be.</p>
<p>Yet, as the Japanese see clearly, to define the issue is the first
duty of a</p>
<p>leader.</p>
<p>But the Japanese approach also means that business-and the other</p>
<p>leadership groups in society-are rarely “surprised. “ It is their
job,</p>
<p>after all, to anticipate and to define the issues. This does not
always</p>
<p>work, of course. Both the bureaucracy and the business leaders of</p>
<p>Japan were totally unprepared for the explosive emergence of the</p>
<p>environmental issue ten years ago-even though by that time it had</p>
<p>already erupted in the United States, so that there was plenty of</p>
<p>warning. Today the leadership groups in Japan-the bureaucracy,</p>
<p>business, labor, and academia-prefer to ignore the challenge of</p>
<p>women moving into professional and managerial jobs; yet the move-</p>
<p>ment is gathering momentum and is grounded in irreversible demo-</p>
<p>graphics. But whereas in the United States business, labor,
govern-</p>
<p>ment, and academia talked of lowering the mandatory retirement age
at</p>
<p>he very time when the growing power of the older people made
first</p>
<p>California and then the U.S. Congress enact laws postponing
retire-</p>
<p>ment or prohibiting mandatory retirement altogether, big business
in</p>
<p>Japan anticipated the issue. And although the costs are very
high,</p>
<p>Japan’s largest companies on their own and without any pressure
from</p>
<p>government, from labor, or from public opinion have raised the
man-</p>
<p>datory retirement age. “It’s what the country needs, ’’ was the
explana-</p>
<p>ion.</p>
<p>The Western approach worked as long as national policy could</p>
<p>effectively be formed through adversary proceedings and by
balancing</p>
<p>he conflicting reactions of large, well-established “blocs“ or</p>
<p>Behind Japan’s Success 403</p>
<p>“interests’’-the traditional economic policy triad of business,
labor,</p>
<p>and farmer. But with the fragmentation of politics in all Western</p>
<p>countries where now small, single-cause zealots hold the swing
vote</p>
<p>and the balance of power, the traditional approach is clearly not</p>
<p>adequate any longer. Thus the Japanese rule under which
leadership</p>
<p>groups, and especially those of the “interests,“ derive their
legitimacy</p>
<p>and authority from their taking responsibility for the national
interest,</p>
<p>and from anticipation, definition, resolution of issues ahead of
time,</p>
<p>might better serve in a pluralist society.</p>
<p>The third of the Japanese habits of effective behavior also
originated</p>
<p>with the banker-entrepreneur-business philosopher Eiichi
Shibuzawa,</p>
<p>in the closing years of the nineteenth century: Leaders of major
groups,</p>
<p>including business, have a duty, so Shibuzawa taught, to
understand</p>
<p>he views, behavior, assumptions, expectations, and values of all
other</p>
<p>major groups, and an equal duty to make their own views,
behavior,</p>
<p>assumptions, expectations, and values in turn known and
understood.</p>
<p>This is not “public relations“ in the Western sense. It is, rather,
very</p>
<p>“private“ relations-relations between individuals; relations made
not</p>
<p>by speeches, pronouncements, press releases, but by the
continuous</p>
<p>interaction of responsible men in policymaking positions.</p>
<p>Irving Shapiro, the chairman and CEO of DuPont de Nemours, the</p>
<p>world’s largest chemical company, was recently quoted in the
Ameri-</p>
<p>can press for pointing out in a public speech that he was now
being</p>
<p>forced to devote four fifths of his time to “relations,“ especially
with</p>
<p>individual policymakers in the Congress and in the Washington bu-</p>
<p>reaucracy, and could only spend one fifth of his time on managing
his</p>
<p>company. The only thing that would have surprised a Japanese CEO
in</p>
<p>a business of comparable importance was the one fifth Mr. Shapiro
has</p>
<p>available to run the company which he heads; very few CEOs of
large</p>
<p>Japanese companies have any time available for managing their
com-</p>
<p>panies. All their time is spent on “relations.“ And what time
they</p>
<p>have for the company is spent on “relations“ too, rather than on</p>
<p>“managing.“ They keep control through thorough and careful atten-</p>
<p>ion to personal decisions in the upper ranks and through
meticulous</p>
<p>financial and planning reports. But they do not “manage“-that is
left</p>
<p>o lower levels. The top people spend their time sitting, sipping a
cup</p>
<p>of green tea, listening, asking a few more questions. They sit with
the</p>
<p>people from their own industry. They sit with suppliers, with the</p>
<p>rading company people, with the managements of subsidiaries. They</p>
<p>sit with top people from other companies in their group-as, for</p>
<p>instance, in the famous four-hour “luncheons“ in which the
presidents</p>
<p>of all companies in the Mitsubishi group come together once a
week.</p>
<p>They sit with the people from the banks. They sit with the senior</p>
<p>bureaucrats of the various ministries, and on half a dozen
committees</p>
<p>in each of half a dozen economic and industry federations. They
sit</p>
<p>with the people of their own company in an after-hours party in a</p>
<p>Ginza bar. They sit and sit and sit.</p>
<p>In these sittings they do not necessarily discuss business-and</p>
<p>surely not their own business. Indeed, to a Westerner the
conversation</p>
<p>at times appears quite pointless. It ranges far afield–or so it
seems-</p>
<p>from issues of economic policy to personal concerns, to the other</p>
<p>fellow’s questions and his problems, to the topics of the day, to</p>
<p>expectations for the future, and to reappraisal of lessons of the
past.</p>
<p>The aim is not to “solve“ anything, but to establish mutual
under-</p>
<p>standing. Then one knows where to go when there is a “problem“-</p>
<p>and there is, of course, always one, sooner or later. Then one
knows</p>
<p>what the other person and his institution expect, can do and will
do-</p>
<p>but also what they cannot or will not do. And then, when either
crisis</p>
<p>or opportunity arrives, these immobile “sitters“ suddenly act
with</p>
<p>amazing speed and decisiveness, and indeed ruthlessly. But also
when</p>
<p>he crisis comes, the others are ready to support, or equally, if they
see</p>
<p>he need, to oppose. For the purpose of all this sitting is not to
like one</p>
<p>another; not to agree with one another; not even primarily to trust
one</p>
<p>another: it is to know and understand one another and, above all,
to</p>
<p>know and understand where-and why–one does not like the other,</p>
<p>does not agree, does not trust.</p>
<p>And finally, the effectiveness of the Japanese is based on their
having</p>
<p>learned that living together cannot be based on adversary relations,
but</p>
<p>must have a foundation in common interest and mutual trust.</p>
<p>Adversary relations in Japan have historically been fiercer,
fought</p>
<p>more violently and with less forgiveness or compassion than in
the</p>
<p>West. The popular movie Shiigun does not exaggerate the violence
of</p>
<p>Japanese history, however much it may romanticize other aspects.</p>
<p>Neither “Love thine enemy“ nor “Turn the other cheek“ is to be</p>
<p>found in any of Japan’s creeds. Even nature is violent in Japan,
a</p>
<p>Behind Japan’s Success 405</p>
<p>country of typhoons, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Indeed, Japanese</p>
<p>convention dictates that relations be adversary–or at least be made
to</p>
<p>appear so-where the Westerner sees no need for feuding and re-</p>
<p>crimination when, for instance, a painter or another artist of old
parted</p>
<p>company with his teacher and established his own style or school.
This</p>
<p>radition extends today to divorce, which has reached epidemic
propor-</p>
<p>ions in Japan and is approaching the California rate, especially
among</p>
<p>young, educated couples. An “amicable“ divorce is apparently not</p>
<p>considered proper; it must be made to look “adversary,“ even if
the</p>
<p>couple parts by mutual consent and on reasonably good terms.</p>
<p>But all these are situations in which the relationship is dissolved
for</p>
<p>good. Where people or parties live together, let alone where they
have</p>
<p>o work together, the Japanese make sure that the relationship has at
its</p>
<p>core a mutuality of interest and a common concern. Then there can
be</p>
<p>conflict, disagreement, even combat; for then conflict,
disagreement,</p>
<p>and combat can still be confined and subsumed in a positive bond.</p>
<p>One of the main-though rarely voiced-reasons why the Japanese</p>
<p>automobile companies are reluctant to build plants in the United
States</p>
<p>is their bafflement at management-union relations in the American</p>
<p>automobile industry. They simply cannot understand them. “Our</p>
<p>unions,“ said a young Toyota engineer, an avowed “leftist“ and</p>
<p>“socialist“ with strong pro-union leanings, “fight management.
But</p>
<p>yours fight the company. How can they not know that for anything
to</p>
<p>be good for the company’s employees it has to be good for the</p>
<p>company? Where this is not taken for granted-and it’s completely</p>
<p>obvious to every one of us-no Japanese could be a manager, but no</p>
<p>Japanese could be an employee and subordinate either.“</p>
<p>One does not have to live and work with a competitor; hence</p>
<p>competition tends to be ruthless between different companies in
the</p>
<p>same field and between different groups, for example, between
Sony</p>
<p>and Panasonic or between Mitsui Bank and Fuji Bank. But whenever</p>
<p>here has to be a continuing relationship with the opponent,
common</p>
<p>ground must be found. Then the question that always comes up
first-</p>
<p>he question indeed to which all these endless sittings and
meetings</p>
<p>between the leaders of different groups are largely devoted is:
“What</p>
<p>interests do we share?“ or: “On what issues are we in agreement?“
or:</p>
<p>“What can we do together that will help both of us attain our
respec-</p>
<p>ive goals?“ And great care is then taken to avoid destruction or</p>
<p>damage to the unity and common purpose.</p>
<p>Great care is also taken to see that there be no “final victory“
over</p>
<p>some group or interest with whom one has to live and work. For
then</p>
<p>o win the war means to lose the peace. Thus whenever groups or</p>
<p>interests in Japan have to live together, both will be more
concerned</p>
<p>with making their conflict mutually productive than with winning-</p>
<p>even though the same people in the same group will go all out for
total</p>
<p>victory and for unconditional surrender against an opponent with</p>
<p>whom their group does not have to live and who therefore can
(indeed,</p>
<p>should) be destroyed.</p>
<p>These are rules and, like all rules of this kind, are ideals and
normative</p>
<p>rather than descriptive of what everybody does all the time.
Every</p>
<p>Japanese can point to dozens of cases where the rules were broken
or</p>
<p>disregarded, and with impunity. The rules are also not
necessarily</p>
<p>accepted by everybody as being right. Some of Japan’s most
success-</p>
<p>ful entrepreneurs and business builders-Honda, for instance, or
Mat-</p>
<p>sushita at Panasonic, or Sony-have shown scant respect for some
of</p>
<p>hem. These successful leaders do not, for example, give a great
deal</p>
<p>of time and top management attention to outside relationships, and
do</p>
<p>not care much whether they are accepted in the “club“ or not. They
do</p>
<p>not necessarily agree that putting the national interest first in
one’s</p>
<p>hinking and policies is the responsibility of the business leader;
and</p>
<p>hey may even on occasion have been quite willing to inflict
crushing</p>
<p>defeats on opponents with whom they still have to live and work.</p>
<p>There is also a good deal of criticism within Japan+specially</p>
<p>within business–of some of the rules, and grave doubt whether
they</p>
<p>are still fully appropriate to Japan’s needs. Can top management,
for</p>
<p>instance, devote practically all its time to outside relations or
will it</p>
<p>lose touch with the reality of its business at a time of rapid change
in</p>
<p>economics, markets, and technologies? And there is a good deal of</p>
<p>grumbling to the effect that concern for finding common ground
with</p>
<p>other groups+specially for business finding common ground with</p>
<p>government-has led to spineless appeasement and has only encour-</p>
<p>aged bureaucratic arrogance.</p>
<p>The rules, in other words, are similar to all other such rules in
that</p>
<p>hey have weaknesses, limitations, shortcomings-and in that they
do</p>
<p>not apply universally and without exception. But they surely also
have</p>
<p>Behind Japan’s Success 407</p>
<p>unique strengths and have been uniquely effective. What then is
their</p>
<p>essence, what is the “secret“ of their success?</p>
<p>The most common answer, in Japan as well as in the West, is</p>
<p>hat these rules represent uniquely Japanese traditions and values.
But it</p>
<p>is surely not the whole answer, and is indeed largely the wrong
answer.</p>
<p>Of course, rules of social and political behavior are part of a
culture and</p>
<p>have to fit it, or at least be acceptable to it. And how the Japanese
handle</p>
<p>heir policies, their rules, and their relations is very Japanese
indeed.</p>
<p>But the rules themselves represent a rather than the Japanese
tradition.</p>
<p>They represent a choice between widely different, but equally
tradition-</p>
<p>al, alternatives rather than historical continuity. Some of the
rules,</p>
<p>moreover, have no foundation whatever in Japanese tradition. The</p>
<p>industrial harmony of Japan is usually attributed to history and
tradi-</p>
<p>ional values. But the only historical tradition of relations
between</p>
<p>superior and subordinate in Japanese history is violence and open</p>
<p>warfare. As late as the 1920s, that is, through the formative stage
of</p>
<p>modern Japanese industry, Japan had the world’s worst, most
disrup-</p>
<p>ive and most violent labor relations of any industrial country. And
for</p>
<p>he hundred and fifty years before modern Japan was born in the
Meiji</p>
<p>Restoration of 1867, relations between “bosses“ and “workersM-</p>
<p>between the lords and their military retainers, the Samurai, who
were</p>
<p>he “bosses,“ and the peasants, who were the “workers“-meant at</p>
<p>least one bloody peasant rebellion per year, more than two
hundred</p>
<p>during the period, which was then suppressed just as bloodily.
“Gov-</p>
<p>ernment by assassination“ rather than the building of relationships
or</p>
<p>he finding of common ground was still the rule for relationships</p>
<p>between different groups in the 1930s. And it is not entirely
coincidence</p>
<p>hat both student violence and terrorism began in Japan in the 1960s
and</p>
<p>ook their most extreme form there; both are surely as much a
“Japa-</p>
<p>nese tradition“ as the attempt to find common ground between
oppo-</p>
<p>nents, and maybe more so.</p>
<p>Also these rules did not just evolve. They were strongly opposed</p>
<p>when first propounded and considered quite unrealistic for a long
time.</p>
<p>The greatest figure in Japanese business history is not Eiichi
Shi-</p>
<p>buzawa, who formulated the most important rules of behavior for</p>
<p>oday’s Japanese society. It is Yataro Iwasaki (183485), the
founder</p>
<p>and builder of Mitsubishi, who was to nineteenth-century Japan
what</p>
<p>J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, and John D. Rockefeller, Sr., com-</p>
<p>bined were to the United States. And Iwasaki rejected out of hand</p>
<p>Shibuzawa and his rules-whether the demand that business
leadership</p>
<p>ake responsibility and initiative in respect to the national
interest, or</p>
<p>he demand that it build and nurture its relationships, or in
particular</p>
<p>he idea of finding common ground with opponents and of embedding</p>
<p>conflict in a bond of common interest and unity. Shibuzawa was</p>
<p>greatly respected. But his teachings had little influence with
“practical</p>
<p>men,“ who were far more impressed by Iwasaki’s business success.</p>
<p>Whatever their roots in Japanese traditions, these rules became</p>
<p>accepted and the approved behavior only after World War 11. Then,</p>
<p>when a defeated, humiliated, and almost destroyed Japan began
pain-</p>
<p>fully to rebuild, the question was asked: “What are the right rules
for a</p>
<p>complex modem society, and one that is embedded in a competitive</p>
<p>world economy and dependent on it?“ Only then did the answers</p>
<p>which Shibuzawa had given sixty years earlier come to be seen as
right</p>
<p>and relevant.</p>
<p>Why and how this happened goes well beyond the scope of this</p>
<p>essay, and the author is hardly qualified to answer the question.
There</p>
<p>was no one single leader, no great figure, to put Japan on a new
path.</p>
<p>Indeed, the historians will be as busy trying to explain what
happened</p>
<p>in the 1950s in Japan as they have been to explain what happened at
the</p>
<p>ime of Meiji, eighty years earlier, when an equally humiliated
and</p>
<p>shocked Japan organized itself to become a modem nation and yet
to</p>
<p>remain profoundly Japanese in its culture. One might perhaps
specu-</p>
<p>late that the shock of total defeat and the humiliation of being
occupied</p>
<p>by foreign troops-no foreign soldier ever before had landed on</p>
<p>Japanese soil-created a willingness to try things that had never
been</p>
<p>ried before, even though powerful forces in Japan’s history had
urged</p>
<p>and advocated them. In respect to industrial relations, for instance,
we</p>
<p>know that there was no one single leader. Yet the strong need of</p>
<p>Japanese workers, many of them homeless, many of them discharged</p>
<p>veterans from a defeated army, many of them without employment of</p>
<p>any kind, to find a “home“ and a “community“ was surely an</p>
<p>important factor, as was the strong pressure by workers on
manage-</p>
<p>ment to protect them from the pressures of the American
occupation</p>
<p>and its “liberal“ labor experts to join left-wing unions and to
become a</p>
<p>“revolutionary“ force. The conservatism of the Japanese worker in</p>
<p>he late forties and early fifties, but also the need of the
Japanese</p>
<p>Behind Japan’s Success 409</p>
<p>worker to have a little security when his emotional, his economic,
and</p>
<p>in many cases his family ties had been severed, undoubtedly played
a</p>
<p>large part in the course Japan then took. But why Japanese
manage-</p>
<p>ment found itself able to respond to these needs and in an
effective</p>
<p>form, no one yet knows.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Japanese “rules“ could just as well be explained with</p>
<p>purely “Western“ teachings and traditions. That business
leadership,</p>
<p>especially in big business, needs to take active responsibility
and</p>
<p>initiative for the national interest and must start out with what is
good</p>
<p>for the nation rather than what is good for business, was for
instance</p>
<p>preached in the West around 1900 by such totally un-Japanese
leaders</p>
<p>as Walter Rathenau in Germany, and Mark Hanna in the United
States.</p>
<p>That an enemy that cannot be destroyed must be made into a friend
and</p>
<p>must never be “defeated“ and humiliated was first taught around
1530</p>
<p>by the first modem political thinker, Nicoli, Machiavelli. And
Japan’s</p>
<p>embedding of conflict in a core of unity is also Machiavelli-the</p>
<p>Machiavelli of The Discourses rather than that of The Prince.
Four</p>
<p>hundred years later, in the 1920s, Mary Parker Follett, most proper
of</p>
<p>proper Bostonians, concluded again that conflicts must be made
con-</p>
<p>structive by being embedded in a core of common purpose and com-</p>
<p>mon vision. All these Westerners-Rathenau and Hanna, Machiavelli</p>
<p>and Follett-asked the same questions: How can a complex modem</p>
<p>society, a pluralist society of interdependence, a society in
rapid</p>
<p>change, be effectively governed? How can it make productive its</p>
<p>ensions and conflicts? How can it evolve unity of action out of</p>
<p>diversity of interests, values, and institutions? And how, as Ma-</p>
<p>chiavelli asked, can it derive strength and cohesion from being
sur-</p>
<p>rounded by, and dependent on, a multitude of competing powers?</p>
<p>And why then did the West, and especially the United States,
reject</p>
<p>his tradition while Japan accepted it? Again the scope of this
question</p>
<p>greatly exceeds this essay and the expertise of its author. But
one</p>
<p>might speculate that the Great Depression and its trauma had
some-</p>
<p>hing to do with it. For before it, there was indeed leadership
that</p>
<p>subscribed to these values. Both Herbert Hoover in the United
States</p>
<p>and Heinrich Bruening, the last Chancellor of a democratic
Germany,</p>
<p>represented a tradition that saw in the common interest of all
groups</p>
<p>he catalyst of national and social unity. It was their defeat by the
Great</p>
<p>Depression-for instance, in Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal-</p>
<p>which ushered in a belief in “countervailing power,“ in adversary</p>
<p>relations, as leading to a compromise solution acceptable to all
because</p>
<p>it does not offend any one group too much, and therefore unites
them</p>
<p>on the least common denominator. And surely the victory of
Keynes-</p>
<p>ian economics in the West, and especially in the United States,
with</p>
<p>heir apotheosis of national government as omnipotent, omniscient,</p>
<p>and able to control the national economy almost irrespective of
what</p>
<p>happens outside, had something to do with our forgetting the old
adage</p>
<p>of American politics that “Politics (and economic disputes) stop at
the</p>
<p>water’s edge.“ But this is speculation.</p>
<p>What is fact is that the “secret“ behind Japan’s achievement is not
a</p>
<p>mysterious “Japan Inc.,“ which belongs in a Hollywood Grade B</p>
<p>movie anyhow. It is perhaps not even the particular values of
behavior</p>
<p>hat Japan has been practicing. It may be that Japan, so far alone</p>
<p>among major industrial countries, has asked the right questions:
What</p>
<p>are the rules for a complex modern society, a society of pluralism
and</p>
<p>large organizations which have to coexist in competition and
antago-</p>
<p>nism, a society that is embedded in a competitive and rapidly
changing</p>
<p>world and increasingly dependent on it?</p>
