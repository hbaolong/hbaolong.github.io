<h4 id="introduction-to-part-eight">Introduction to Part Eight</h4>
<p>The Lutheran Protestantism of my childhood was so “liberal“ that
it</p>
<p>consisted of little more than a tree at Christmas and Bach cantatas
at</p>
<p>Easter. And the Pastor-attendance at whose religion class, two
hours</p>
<p>a week, was still mandatory in the Austrian Gymnasium of my
child-</p>
<p>hood-hardly aimed much higher. Thus, I was totally unprepared</p>
<p>when, barely nineteen-a bored trainee at an export house in Ham-</p>
<p>burg, employed mainly in copying invoices for shipments of
padlocks</p>
<p>o India or to East Africa-I encountered Kierkegaard’s masterpiece</p>
<p>Fear and Trembling-accidentally , but, of course, providentially.
It</p>
<p>was many years before I understood what had happened. But I knew</p>
<p>immediately that something had happened. I knew immediately that
I</p>
<p>had found a new, a crucial, an existential dimension. I even then</p>
<p>probably knew that my own work would be totally in society-though</p>
<p>by then I also did suspect that it was not going to be in business
and</p>
<p>hat I was, indeed, most unlikely to become a “commercial
success.“</p>
<p>And even though I later did teach religion for a few years (though
only</p>
<p>on the side) my work has indeed been totally in society. But I knew
at</p>
<p>once, in those far-back days of 1928, that my life would not and
could</p>
<p>not be totally in society, that it would have to have an
existential</p>
<p>dimension which transcends society.</p>
<p>Still, my work has been totally in society+xcept for this essay
on</p>
<p>Kierkegaard. It was written out of despair. For the years after
World</p>
<p>War I1 were years of deep despair. I had predicted Hitler’s
“Final</p>
<p>Solution,“ the killing of all Jews, in my 1939 book The End of</p>
<p>Economic Man (to be reissued in the Transaction series of my
books).</p>
<p>Still, the reality of the Holocaust as it unfolded after the end of
World</p>
<p>War I1 was infinitely more horrible then the abstractions of my book.
I</p>
<p>had in the same book portrayed Stalinism as obscene, nightmarish</p>
<p>error and tyranny-and had earned the everlasting hatred of all
well-</p>
<p>meaning “progressives“ for doing so. Still, the reality of
Stalinist</p>
<p>error as it unfolded after World War II-the ruthless persecution
and</p>
<p>mass execution of Russian soldiers, for instance, whose only
“crime“</p>
<p>was that, being wounded in battle, they had been captured by the</p>
<p>Germans, or the murder on Stalin’s orders of Czechoslovakia’s
last</p>
<p>rue Democrat, Jan Masaryk, were so much worse than anything I</p>
<p>could possibly have imagined that I despaired of humanity. And
where</p>
<p>Communism before World War I1 was content to try to foment
revolu-</p>
<p>ion everywhere, Stalin, after the “World Revolution“ had proven
to</p>
<p>be a wet squib, was clearly determined on world conquest by
military</p>
<p>might. Having already conquered Eastern Europe, he was in those</p>
<p>days attacking Greece and Iran and was threatening Norway. And
then</p>
<p>here was the atom bomb! And all this horror was aggravated by the</p>
<p>infatuation of the intellectuals with Stalin and with communist
tyran-</p>
<p>ny, and by the prattle of the “Establishment“ about our having</p>
<p>attained “eternal peace“ and “the new world orderv-and I, by that</p>
<p>ime, had of course myself become a member (albeit a junior one)
of</p>
<p>his Establishment.</p>
<p>“The Unfashionable Kierkegaard“ was thus written as an affirma-</p>
<p>ion of the existential, the spiritual, the individual dimension of
the</p>
<p>Creature. It was written to assert that society is not enough-not
even</p>
<p>for society. It was written to affirm hope.</p>
