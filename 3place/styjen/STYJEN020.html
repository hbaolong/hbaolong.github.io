<h4 id="can-there-be-business-ethics">Can There Be “Business
Ethics“?</h4>
<p>“Business ethics“ is rapidly becoming the “in“ subject, replacing</p>
<p>yesterday’s “social responsibilities. “ Business ethics is now
being</p>
<p>aught in departments of philosophy, business schools, and
theological</p>
<p>seminaries. There are countless seminars on it, speeches,
articles,</p>
<p>conferences, and books, not to mention the many earnest attempts
to</p>
<p>write business ethics into the law. But what precisely is
business</p>
<p>ethics? And what could, or should, it be? Is it just another fad,
and</p>
<p>only the latest round in the hoary American blood sport of
business</p>
<p>baiting? Is there more to business ethics than the revivalist
preacher’s</p>
<p>call to the sinner to repent? And if there is indeed something that
one</p>
<p>could call business ethics and could take seriously, what could it
be?</p>
<p>Ethics is, after all, not a recent discovery. Over the centuries</p>
<p>philosophers in their struggle with human behavior have developed</p>
<p>different approaches to ethics, each leading to different
conclusions,</p>
<p>indeed to conflicting rules of behavior. Where does business ethics
fit</p>
<p>in–or does it fit in anywhere at all?</p>
<p>The confusion is so great-and the noise level even greater-that</p>
<p>perhaps an attempt might be in order to sort out what business
ethics</p>
<p>might be, and what it might not be, in the light of the major
approaches</p>
<p>which philosophers have taken throughout the ages (though my only</p>
<p>qualification for making this attempt is that I once, many years
before</p>
<p>anybody even thought of business ethics, taught philosophy and
reli-</p>
<p>Published first in The Public Interest, 1981.</p>
<p>gion, and then worked arduously on the tangled questions of
“political</p>
<p>ethics“).</p>
<p>Business Ethics and the Western Tradition</p>
<p>To the moralist of the Western tradition business ethics would
make</p>
<p>no sense. Indeed, the very term would to him be most
objectionable,</p>
<p>and reeking of moral laxity. The authorities on ethics disagreed,
of</p>
<p>course, on what constitutes the grounds of morality-whether they
be</p>
<p>divine, human nature, or the needs of society. They equally
disagreed</p>
<p>on the specific rules of ethical behavior; that sternest of moral
rules,</p>
<p>he Ten Commandments, for instance, thunders “Thou shalt not covet</p>
<p>hy neighbor’s . . . maidservant.“ But it says nothing about
sexual</p>
<p>harassment of one’s own women employees, though it was surely
just</p>
<p>as common then as now.</p>
<p>All authorities of the Western tradition-from the Old Testament</p>
<p>prophets all the way to Spinoza in the seventeenth century, to Kant
in</p>
<p>he eighteenth century, Kierkegaard in the nineteenth century, and,
in</p>
<p>his century, the Englishman F. H. Bradley (Ethical Studies) or
the</p>
<p>American Edmond Cahn (The Moral Decision)-are, however, in</p>
<p>complete agreement on one point: There is only one ethics, one set
of</p>
<p>rules of morality, one code, that of individual behavior in which
the</p>
<p>same rules apply to everyone alike.</p>
<p>A pagan could say, “Quod licet Jovi non licet bovi.“ He could
thus</p>
<p>hold that different rules of behavior apply to Jupiter from those
that</p>
<p>apply to the ox. A Jew or a Christian would have to reject such</p>
<p>differentiation in ethics-and precisely because all experience
shows</p>
<p>hat it always leads to exempting the “Jupiters,“ the great,
powerful,</p>
<p>and rich, from the rules which “the ox,“ the humble and poor, has
to</p>
<p>abide by.</p>
<p>The moralist of the Western tradition accepts “extenuating“ and</p>
<p>“aggravating“ circumstances. He accepts that the poor widow who</p>
<p>steals bread to feed her starving children deserves clemency and that
it</p>
<p>is a more heinous offense for the bishop to have a concubine than
for</p>
<p>he poor curate in the village. But before there can be extenuating
or</p>
<p>aggravating circumstances, there has to be an offense. And the
offense</p>
<p>is the same for rich and poor, for high and low alike-theft is
theft,</p>
<p>concubinage is concubinage. The reason for this insistence on a
code</p>
<p>Can There Be “Business Ethics“? 197</p>
<p>hat considers only the individual, and not his status in life or
society,</p>
<p>is precisely that otherwise the mighty, the powerful, the successful
will</p>
<p>gain exemption from the laws of ethics and morality.</p>
<p>The only differences between what is ethically right and
ethically</p>
<p>wrong behavior which traditional moralists, almost without
exception,</p>
<p>would accept-would indeed insist on-are differences grounded in</p>
<p>social or cultural mores, and then only in respect to venial
offenses,</p>
<p>hat is, the way things are done rather than the substance of
behavior.</p>
<p>Even in the most licentious society, fidelity to the marriage vow
is</p>
<p>meritorious, all moralists would agree; but the sexual license of
an</p>
<p>extremely permissive society, say seventeenth century Restoration</p>
<p>England or late twentieth century America, might be considered an</p>
<p>extenuating circumstance for the sexual transgressor. And even
the</p>
<p>sternest moralist has always insisted that, excepting only true
matters</p>
<p>of conscience, practices that are of questionable morality in one
place</p>
<p>and culture might be perfectly acceptable-and indeed might be
quite</p>
<p>ethical-in another cultural surrounding. Nepotism may be
considered</p>
<p>of dubious morality in one culture, in today’s United States, for</p>
<p>instance. In other cultures, a traditional Chinese one, for example,
it</p>
<p>may be the very essence of ethical behavior, both by satisfying
the</p>
<p>moral obligation to one’s family and by making disinterested service
to</p>
<p>he public a little more likely.</p>
<p>But-and this is the crucial point-these are qualifications to the</p>
<p>fundamental axiom on which the Western tradition of ethics has</p>
<p>always been based: There is only one code of ethics, that of
individual</p>
<p>behavior, for prince and pauper, for rich and poor, for the mighty
and</p>
<p>he meek alike. Ethics, in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, is the
affir-</p>
<p>mation that all men and women are alike creatures-whether the</p>
<p>Creator be called God, Nature, or Society.</p>
<p>And this fundamental axiom business ethics denies. Viewed from</p>
<p>he mainstream of traditional ethics, business ethics is not ethics at
all,</p>
<p>whatever else it may be. For it asserts that acts that are not
immoral or</p>
<p>illegal if done by ordinary folk become immoral or illegal if done
by</p>
<p>business.</p>
<p>One blatant example is the treatment of extortion in the current</p>
<p>discussions of business ethics. No one ever has had a good word to
say</p>
<p>for extortion, or has advocated paying it. But if you and I are found
to</p>
<p>have paid extortion money under threat of physical or material
harm,</p>
<p>we are not considered to have behaved immorally or illegally. The</p>
<p>extortioner is both immoral and a criminal. If a business submits
to</p>
<p>extortion, however, current business ethics considers it to have
acted</p>
<p>unethically. There is no speech, article, book, or conference on
busi-</p>
<p>ness ethics, for instance, which does not point an accusing finger
in</p>
<p>great indignation at Lockheed for giving in to a Japanese airline</p>
<p>company, which extorted money as a prerequisite to considering
the</p>
<p>purchase of Lockheed’s faltering L-1011 jet plane. There was very</p>
<p>little difference between Lockheed’s paying the Japanese and the</p>
<p>pedestrian in New York’s Central Park handing his wallet over to
a</p>
<p>mugger. Yet no one would consider the pedestrian to have acted</p>
<p>unethically .</p>
<p>Similarly, in Senate confirmation hearings, one of President Rea-</p>
<p>gan’s cabinet appointees was accused of “unethical practices“ and</p>
<p>investigated for weeks because his New Jersey construction
company</p>
<p>was alleged to have paid money to union goons under the threat of
their</p>
<p>beating up the employees, sabotaging the trucks, and vandalizing
the</p>
<p>building sites. The accusers were self-confessed labor racketeers;
no</p>
<p>one seemed to have worried about their ethics.</p>
<p>One can argue that both Lockheed and the New Jersey builder were</p>
<p>stupid to pay the holdup men. But as the old saying has it:
“Stupidity</p>
<p>is not a court martial offense.“ Under the new business ethics, it
does</p>
<p>become exactly that, however. And this is not compatible with
what</p>
<p>ethics always was supposed to be.</p>
<p>The new business ethics also denies to business the adaptation to</p>
<p>cultural mores which has always been considered a moral duty in
the</p>
<p>raditional approach to ethics. It is now considered grossly
unethical-</p>
<p>indeed it may even be a questionable practice if not criminal
offense-</p>
<p>for an American business operating in Japan to retain as a
counselor</p>
<p>he distinguished civil servant who retires from his official position
in</p>
<p>he Japanese government. Yet the business that does not do this is</p>
<p>considered in Japan to behave antisocially and to violate its
clear</p>
<p>ethical duties. Business taking care of retired senior civil
servants, the</p>
<p>Japanese hold, makes possible two practices they consider essential
to</p>
<p>he public interest: that a civil servant past age forty-five must
retire as</p>
<p>soon as he is outranked by anyone younger than he; and that
govern-</p>
<p>mental salaries and retirement pensions-and with them the burden
of</p>
<p>he bureaucracy on the taxpayers-be kept low, with the difference</p>
<p>Can There Be “Business Ethics“? 199</p>
<p>between what a first-rate man gets in government service and what
he</p>
<p>might earn in private employment made up after his retirement
through</p>
<p>his counselor’s fees. The Japanese maintain that the expectation
of</p>
<p>later on being a counselor encourages a civil servant to remain
incor-</p>
<p>ruptible, impartial, and objective, and thus to serve only the
public</p>
<p>good; his counselorships are obtained for him by his former
ministry</p>
<p>and its recommendation depends on his rating by his colleagues as
a</p>
<p>public servant. The Germans, who follow a somewhat similar prac-</p>
<p>ice-with senior civil servants expected to be taken care of
through</p>
<p>appointment as industry-association executives-share this
conviction.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the fact that both the Japanese and the German
systems</p>
<p>seem to serve their respective societies well and indeed honorably,
and</p>
<p>even despite the fact that it is considered perfectly ethical for
American</p>
<p>civil servants of equal rank and caliber to move into well-paid
execu-</p>
<p>ive jobs in business and foundations and into even more lucrative
law</p>
<p>practices, the American company in Japan that abides by a practice
the</p>
<p>Japanese consider the very essence of social responsibility, is
pilloried</p>
<p>in the present discussion of business ethics as a horrible example
of</p>
<p>unethical practices.</p>
<p>Surely business ethics assumes that for some reason the ordinary</p>
<p>rules of ethics do not apply to business. Business ethics, in
other</p>
<p>words, is not ethics at all, as the term has commonly been used
by</p>
<p>Western philosophers and Western theologians. What is it then?</p>
<p>Casuistry: The Ethics of Social Responsibility</p>
<p>“It’s casuistry,“ the historian of Western philosophy would
answer.</p>
<p>Casuistry asserted that rulers, because of their responsibility, have
to</p>
<p>strike a balance between the ordinary demands of ethics which apply
to</p>
<p>hem as individuals and their social responsibility to their
subjects,</p>
<p>heir kingdom-r their company.</p>
<p>Casuistry was first propounded in Calvin’s Institutes, then taken</p>
<p>over by the Catholic theologians of the Counter-Reformation
(Bellar-</p>
<p>min, for instance, or St. Charles Borromeus) and developed into a</p>
<p>political ethics by their Jesuit disciples in the seventeenth
century.</p>
<p>Casuistry was the first attempt to think through social
responsibility</p>
<p>and to embed it in a set of special ethics for those in power. In
this</p>
<p>respect, business ethics tries to do exactly what the casuists did
300</p>
<p>years ago. And it must end the same way. If business ethics
continues</p>
<p>o be casuistry its speedy demise in a cloud of ill-repute can be</p>
<p>confidently predicted.</p>
<p>To the casuist the social responsibility inherent in being a
ruler-</p>
<p>hat is, someone whose actions have impact on others-is by itself
an</p>
<p>ethical imperative. As such, the ruler has a duty, as Calvin first
laid</p>
<p>down, to subordinate his individual behavior and his individual
con-</p>
<p>science to the demands of his social responsibility.</p>
<p>The locus classicus of casuistry is Henry VIII and his first
marriage</p>
<p>o Catherine of Aragon. A consummated marriage-and Catherine of</p>
<p>Aragon had a daughter by Henry, the future “Bloody Mary“–could</p>
<p>not be dissolved except by death, both Catholic and Protestant
theo-</p>
<p>logians agreed. In casuistry, however, as both Catholics and
Protes-</p>
<p>ants agreed, Henry VIII had an ethical duty to seek annulment of
the</p>
<p>marriage. Until his father, well within living memory, had
snatched</p>
<p>he Crown by force of arms, England had suffered a century of
bloody</p>
<p>and destructive civil war because of the lack of a legitimate male
heir.</p>
<p>Without annulment of his marriage, Henry VIII, in other words,</p>
<p>exposed his country and its people to mortal danger, well beyond</p>
<p>anything he could in conscience justify. The one point on which</p>
<p>Protestants and Catholics disagreed was whether the Pope also had
a</p>
<p>social, and thereby an ethical, responsibility to grant Henry’s
request.</p>
<p>By not granting it, he drove the king and his English subjects out of
the</p>
<p>Catholic Church. But had he granted the annulment, the Catholic</p>
<p>casuists argued, the Pope would have driven Catherine’s uncle,
the</p>
<p>Holy Roman Emperor, out of the Church and into the waiting arms
of</p>
<p>an emerging Protestantism; and that would have meant that instead
of</p>
<p>assigning a few million Englishmen to heresy, perdition, and
hellfire,</p>
<p>many times more souls-all the people in all the lands controlled
by</p>
<p>he Emperor, that is, in most of Europe–could have been consigned
to</p>
<p>everlasting perdition.</p>
<p>This may be considered a quaint example-but only because our</p>
<p>ime judges behavior by economic rather than theological
absolutes.</p>
<p>The example illustrates what is wrong with casuistry and indeed why
it</p>
<p>must fail as an approach to ethics. In the first place casuistry must
end</p>
<p>up becoming politicized, precisely because it considers social
respon-</p>
<p>sibility an ethical absolute. In giving primacy to political values
and</p>
<p>goals it subordinates ethics to politics. Clearly this is the
approach</p>
<p>Can There Be “Business Ethics“? 201</p>
<p>business ethics today is taking. Its very origin is in politics
rather than</p>
<p>in ethics. It expresses a belief that the responsibility which
business</p>
<p>and the business executive have, precisely because they have
social</p>
<p>impact, must determine ethics-and this is a political rather than
an</p>
<p>ethical imperative.</p>
<p>Equally important, the casuist inevitably becomes the apologist
for</p>
<p>he ruler, the powerful. Casuistry starts out with the insight that
the</p>
<p>behavior of rulers affects more than themselves and their families.
It</p>
<p>hus starts out by making demands on the ruler-the starting point
for</p>
<p>both Calvin and his Catholic disciples in the Counter-Reformation
fifty</p>
<p>years later. It then concludes that rulers must, therefore, in
conscience</p>
<p>and ethics, subordinate their interests, including their individual
mo-</p>
<p>rality, to their social responsibility. But this implies that the
rules</p>
<p>which decide what is ethical for ordinary people do not apply
equally,</p>
<p>if at all, to those with social responsibility. Ethics for them is
instead a</p>
<p>cost-benefit calculation involving the demands of individual con-</p>
<p>science and the demands of position-and that means that the
rulers</p>
<p>are exempt from the demands of ethics, if only their behavior can
be</p>
<p>argued to confer benefits on other people. And this is precisely
how</p>
<p>business ethics is going.</p>
<p>Indeed, under casuist analysis the ethical violations which to
most</p>
<p>present proponents of business ethics appear the most heinous
crimes</p>
<p>urn out to have been practically saintly.</p>
<p>Take Lockheed’s bribe story for instance. Lockheed was led into</p>
<p>paying extortion money to a Japanese airline by the collapse of
the</p>
<p>supplier of the engines for its wide-bodied L-1011 passenger jet,
the</p>
<p>English Rolls Royce Company. At that time Lockheed employed some</p>
<p>25,000 people making L- 1011s, most of them in southern
California</p>
<p>which then, 1972-73, was suffering substantial unemployment from</p>
<p>sharp cutbacks in defense orders in the aerospace industry. To
safe-</p>
<p>guard the 25,000 jobs, Lockheed got a large government subsidy.
But</p>
<p>o be able to maintain these jobs, Lockheed needed at least one
large</p>
<p>L- 101 1 order from one major airline. The only one among the
major</p>
<p>airlines not then committed to a competitor’s plane was
All-Nippon</p>
<p>Airways in Japan. The self-interest of Lockheed Corporation and of
its</p>
<p>stockholders would clearly have demanded speedy abandonment of
the</p>
<p>L- 101I . It was certain that it would never make money-and it has
not</p>
<p>made a penny yet. Jettisoning the L- I01 1 would immediately have</p>
<p>boosted Lockheed’s earnings, maybe doubled them. It would have</p>
<p>immediately boosted Lockheed’s share price; stock market analysts</p>
<p>and investment bankers pleaded with the firm to get rid of the
alba-</p>
<p>ross. If Lockheed had abandoned the L-1011, instead of paying</p>
<p>extortion money to the Japanese for ordering a few planes and
thus</p>
<p>keeping the project alive, the company’s earnings, its stock price,
and</p>
<p>he bonuses and stock options of top management, would immediately</p>
<p>have risen sharply. Not to have paid extortion money to the
Japanese</p>
<p>would to a casuist, have been self-serving. To a casuist, paying
the</p>
<p>extortion money was a duty and social responsibility to which the
self-</p>
<p>interest of the company, its shareholders, and its executives had to
be</p>
<p>subordinated. It was the discharge of social responsibility of the
ruler</p>
<p>o keep alive the jobs of 25,000 people at a time when jobs in the</p>
<p>aircraft industry in southern California were scarce indeed.</p>
<p>Similarly, the other great horror story of business ethics would,
to</p>
<p>he casuist, appear as an example of business virtue if not of
unselfish</p>
<p>business martyrdom. In the “electrical apparatus conspiracy“ of
the</p>
<p>late 1950s, several high-ranking General Electric executives were
sent</p>
<p>o jail. They were found guilty of a criminal conspiracy in violation
of</p>
<p>antitrust because orders for heavy generating equipment, such as</p>
<p>urbines, were parceled out among the three electrical apparatus
manu-</p>
<p>facturers in the United States–General Electric, Westinghouse,
and</p>
<p>Allis Chalmers. But this “criminal conspiracy“ only served to
reduce</p>
<p>General Electric’s sales, its profits, and the bonuses and stock
options</p>
<p>of the General Electric executives who took part in the
conspiracy.</p>
<p>Since the electric apparatus cartel was destroyed by the criminal</p>
<p>prosecution of the General Electric executives, General Electric
sales</p>
<p>and profits in the heavy apparatus field have sharply increased, as
has</p>
<p>market penetration by the company, which now has what amounts to
a</p>
<p>near-monopoly. The purpose of the cartel-which incidentally was</p>
<p>started under federal government pressure in the Depression years
to</p>
<p>fight unemployment-was the protection of the weakest and most</p>
<p>dependent of the companies, Allis Chalmers (which is located in</p>
<p>Milwaukee, a depressed and declining old industrial area.) As soon
as</p>
<p>government action destroyed the cartel, Allis Chalmers had to go
out</p>
<p>of the turbine business and had to lay off several thousand people.
And</p>
<p>while there is still abundant competition in the world market for
heavy</p>
<p>electric apparatus, General Electric now enjoys such market domi-</p>
<p>Can There Be “Business Ethics“? 203</p>
<p>nance in the home market that the United States, in case of war,
would</p>
<p>not have major alternative suppliers of so critical a product as
turbines.</p>
<p>The casuist would agree that cartels are both illegal and
considered</p>
<p>immoral in the United Stats-although not necessarily anyplace else
in</p>
<p>he world. But he would also argue that the General Electric
executive</p>
<p>who violated U.S. law had an ethical duty to do so under the
higher</p>
<p>law of social responsibility to safeguard both employment in the</p>
<p>Milwaukee area and the defense-production base of the United
States.</p>
<p>The only thing that is surprising about these examples is that
busi-</p>
<p>ness has not yet used them to climb on the casuist bandwagon of</p>
<p>business ethics. For just as almost any behavior indulged in by
the</p>
<p>seventeenth century ruler could be shown to be an ethical duty by
the</p>
<p>seventeenth century disciples of Calvin, of Bellarmin, and of
Bor-</p>
<p>romeus, so almost any behavior of the executive in organizations</p>
<p>oday-whether in a business, a hospital, a university, or a
govern-</p>
<p>ment agency–could be shown to be his ethical duty under the
casuistic</p>
<p>cost-benefit analysis between individual ethics and the demands
of</p>
<p>social responsibility. There are indeed signs aplenty that that
most</p>
<p>apolitical of rulers, the American business executive, is waking up
to</p>
<p>he political potential of business ethics. Some of the
advertisements</p>
<p>which large companies-Mobil Oil, for example-are now running to</p>
<p>counter the attacks made on them in the name of social
responsibility</p>
<p>and business ethics, clearly use the casuist approach to defend
busi-</p>
<p>ness, and indeed to counterattack. But if business ethics becomes
a</p>
<p>ool to defend as ethical acts on the part of executives that would
be</p>
<p>condemned if committed by anyone else, the present proponents of</p>
<p>business ethics, like their casuist predecessors 400 years ago, will
have</p>
<p>no one to blame but themselves.</p>
<p>Casuistry started out as high morality. In the end, its ethics came
to</p>
<p>be summed up in two well-known pieces of cynicism: “An ambas-</p>
<p>sador is an honest man, lying abroad for the good of his
country,“</p>
<p>went a well-known eighteenth century pun. And a hundred years
later,</p>
<p>Bismarck said, “What a scoundrel a minister would be if, in his own
private life, he did half the things he has a duty to do to be true to
his oath of office.“</p>
<p>Long before that, however, casuistry had been killed off by moral</p>
<p>revulsion. Its most lasting memory perhaps are the reactions to
it</p>
<p>which reestablished ethics in the West as a universal system,
binding</p>
<p>he individual regardless of station, function, or social
responsibility:</p>
<p>Spinoza’s Ethics, and the Provincial Letters of his contemporary,</p>
<p>Blaise Pascal. But also-and this is a lesson that might be pondered
by</p>
<p>oday’s proponents of business ethics, so many of whom are clergy-</p>
<p>men-it was their embracing casuistry that made the Jesuits hated
and</p>
<p>despised, made “Jesuitical“ a synonym of immoral, and led to the</p>
<p>Jesuit order being suppressed by the Pope in the eighteenth
century.</p>
<p>And it is casuistry, more than anything else, that has caused the</p>
<p>anticlericalism of the intellectuals in Catholic Europe.</p>
<p>Business ethics undoubtedly is a close parallel to casuistry. Its
origin</p>
<p>is political, as was that of casuistry. Its basic thesis, that ethics
for the</p>
<p>ruler, and especially for the business executive, has to express
social</p>
<p>responsibility is exactly the starting point of the casuist. But if
business</p>
<p>ethics is casuistry, then it will not last long-and long before it
dies, it</p>
<p>will have become a tool of the business executive to justify what
for</p>
<p>other people would be unethical behavior, rather than a tool to
restrain</p>
<p>he business executive and to impose tight ethical limits on
business.</p>
<p>The Ethics of Prudence and Self-Development</p>
<p>There is one other major tradition of ethics in the West, the Ethics
of</p>
<p>Prudence. It goes all the way back to Aristotle and his enthronement
of</p>
<p>prudence as a cardinal virtue. It continued for almost 2,000 years in
the</p>
<p>popular literary tradition of the “Education of the Christian
Prince,“</p>
<p>which reached its ultimate triumph and its reduction to absurdity
in</p>
<p>Machiavelli’s Prince. Its spirit can best be summed up by the
advice</p>
<p>which then-Senator Harry Truman gave to an Army witness before
his</p>
<p>committee in the early years of World War 11: “Generals should
never</p>
<p>do anything that needs to be explained to a Senate Committee-there
is</p>
<p>nothing one can explain to a Senate Committee.“</p>
<p>“Generals,“ whether the organization is an army, a corporation,
or</p>
<p>a university, are highly visible. They must expect their behavior to
be</p>
<p>seen, scrutinized, analyzed, discussed, and questioned. Prudence
thus</p>
<p>demands that they shun actions that cannot easily be understood,</p>
<p>explained, or justified. But generals, being visible, are also
examples.</p>
<p>They are leaders by their very position and visibility. Their only
choice</p>
<p>is whether their example leads others to right action or to wrong
action.</p>
<p>Their only choice is between direction and misdirection, between</p>
<p>Can There Be “Business Ethics“? 205</p>
<p>leadership and misleadership. They thus have an ethical obligation
to</p>
<p>give the example of right behavior and to avoid giving the example
of</p>
<p>wrong behavior.</p>
<p>The Ethics of Prudence does not spell out what “right“ behavior
is.</p>
<p>They assume that what is wrong behavior is clear enough-and if
there</p>
<p>is any doubt, it is “questionable“ and to be avoided. Prudence
makes</p>
<p>it an ethical duty for the leader to exemplify the precepts of ethics
in</p>
<p>his own behavior.</p>
<p>And by following prudence, everyone regardless of status becomes</p>
<p>a leader, a superior man and will “fulfill himself,“ to use the
contem-</p>
<p>porary idiom. One becomes the superior man by avoiding any act</p>
<p>which would make one the kind of person one does not want to be,</p>
<p>does not respect, does not accept as superior. “If you don’t want to
see</p>
<p>a pimp when you look in the shaving mirror in the morning, don’t
hire</p>
<p>call girls the night before to entertain congressmen, customers,
or</p>
<p>salesmen.“ On any other basis, hiring call girls may be condemned
as</p>
<p>vulgar and tasteless, and may be shunned as something fastidious</p>
<p>people do not do. It may be frowned upon as uncouth. It may even
be</p>
<p>illegal. But only in prudence is it ethically relevant. This is
what</p>
<p>Kierkegaard, the sternest moralist of the nineteenth century,
meant</p>
<p>when he said that aesthetics is the true ethics.</p>
<p>The Ethics of Prudence can easily degenerate. Concern with what</p>
<p>one can justify becomes, only too easily, concern with
appearances-</p>
<p>Machiavelli was by no means the first to point out that in a Prince,
that</p>
<p>is, in someone in authority and high visibility, appearances may
matter</p>
<p>more than substance. The Ethics of Prudence thus easily decays
into</p>
<p>he hypocrisy of public relations. Leadership through right
example</p>
<p>easily degenerates into the sham of charisma and into a cloak for</p>
<p>misdirection and misleadership-it is always the Hitlers and the
Stalins</p>
<p>who are the great charismatic leaders. And fulfilment through
self-de-</p>
<p>velopment into a superior person-what Kierkegaard called “becom-</p>
<p>ing a Christian2’-may turn either into the smugness of the
Pharisee</p>
<p>who thanks God that he is not like other people, or into
self-indulgence</p>
<p>instead of self-discipline, moral sloth instead of self-respect, and
into</p>
<p>saying “I like,“ rather than “I know.“</p>
<p>Yet, despite these degenerative tendencies, the Ethics of Prudence
is</p>
<p>surely appropriate to a society of organizations. Of course, it will
not</p>
<p>be business ethics-it makes absolutely no difference in the Ethics
of</p>
<p>Prudence whether the executive is a general in the Army, a bureau</p>
<p>chief in the Treasury Department in Washington, a senator, a judge,
a</p>
<p>senior vice president in a bank, or a hospital administrator. But
a</p>
<p>society of organizations is a society in which an extraordinarily
large</p>
<p>number of people are in positions of high visibility, if only within
one</p>
<p>organization. They enjoy this visibility not, like the Christian
Prince,</p>
<p>by virtue of birth, nor by virtue of wealth-that is, not because they
are</p>
<p>personages. They are functionaries and important only through
their</p>
<p>responsibility to take right action. But this is exactly what the
Ethics of</p>
<p>Prudence is all about.</p>
<p>Similarly, executives set examples, whatever the organization.
They</p>
<p>set the tone, create the spirit, decide the values for an
organization and</p>
<p>for the people in it. They lead or mislead, in other words. And
they</p>
<p>have no choice but to do one or the other. Above all, the ethics
or</p>
<p>aesthetics of self-development would seem to be tailor-made for
the</p>
<p>specific dilemma of the executive in the modem organization. By</p>
<p>himself he is a nobody and indeed anonymous. A week after he has</p>
<p>retired and has left that big comer office on the twenty-sixth floor
of</p>
<p>his company’s skyscraper or the Secretary’s six-room corner suite
on</p>
<p>Constitution Avenue, no one in the building even recognizes him</p>
<p>anymore. And his neighbors in the pleasant suburb in which he lives
in</p>
<p>a comfortable middle-class house-very different from anything one</p>
<p>might call a palace–only know that “Joe works someplace on Park</p>
<p>Avenue“ or “does something in the government.“ Yet collectively</p>
<p>hese anonymous executives are the leaders in a modern society.
Their</p>
<p>function demands the self-discipline and the self-respect of the
superi-</p>
<p>or man. To live up to the performance expectations society makes</p>
<p>upon them, they have to strive for self-fulfilment rather than be
content</p>
<p>with lackadaisical mediocrity. Yet at the pinnacle of their career
and</p>
<p>success, they are still cogs in an organization and easily
replaceable.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what self-fulfilment in ethics, the
Kierkegaardian</p>
<p>“becoming a Christian,“ concerns itself with: how to become the</p>
<p>superior man, important and autonomous, without being a big shot
let</p>
<p>alone a Prince.</p>
<p>One would therefore expect the discussion of business ethics to</p>
<p>focus on the Ethics of Prudence. Some of the words, such as to
“fulfill</p>
<p>oneself,“ indeed sound the same, though they mean something quite</p>
<p>different. But by and large, the discussion of business ethics, even
if</p>
<p>Can There Be “Business Ethics“? 207</p>
<p>more sensibly concerning itself with the ethics of organization,
will</p>
<p>have nothing to do with prudence.</p>
<p>The reason is clearly that the Ethics of Prudence is the ethics
of</p>
<p>authority. And while today’s discussion of business ethics (or of
the</p>
<p>ethics of university administration, of hospital administration, or
of</p>
<p>government) clamors for responsibility, it rejects out of hand
any</p>
<p>authority and, of course, particularly any authority of the
business</p>
<p>executive. Authority is not legitimate; it is “elitism.“ But there
can be</p>
<p>no responsibility where authority is denied. To deny it is not
anarchism</p>
<p>nor radicalism, let alone socialism. In a child, it is called a
temper</p>
<p>antrum.</p>
<p>The Ethics of Interdependence</p>
<p>Casuistry was so thoroughly discredited that the only mention of
it</p>
<p>o be found in most textbooks on the history of philosophy is in</p>
<p>connection with its ultimate adversaries-Spinoza and Pascal.
Indeed,</p>
<p>only ten or fifteen years ago, few if any philosophers would have</p>
<p>hought it possible for anything like “business ethics“ to emerge.</p>
<p>“Particularist ethics,“ a set of ethics that postulates that this or
that</p>
<p>group is different in its ethical responsibilities from everyone
else,</p>
<p>would have been considered doomed forever by the failure of
casuis-</p>
<p>ry. Ethics, almost anyone in the West would have considered
axioma-</p>
<p>ic, would surely always be ethics of the individual and independent
of</p>
<p>rank and station.</p>
<p>But there is another, non-Western ethics that is situational. It is
the</p>
<p>most successful and most durable ethics of them all: the
Confucian</p>
<p>ethics of interdependence.</p>
<p>Confucian ethics elegantly sidesteps the trap into which the
casuists</p>
<p>fell; it is a universal ethics, in which the same rules and
imperatives of</p>
<p>behavior hold for every individual. There is no social
responsibility</p>
<p>overriding individual conscience, no cost-benefit calculation, no
great-</p>
<p>er good or higher measure than the individual and his behavior,
and</p>
<p>altogether no casuistry. In the Confucian ethics, the rules are the
same</p>
<p>for all. But there are different general rules, according to the five
basic</p>
<p>relationships of interdependence, which for the Confucian embrace
the</p>
<p>otality of individual interactions in civil society: superior and
subordi-</p>
<p>nate (or master and servant); father and child; husband and wife;
oldest</p>
<p>brother and sibling; friend and friend. Right behavior-what in
the</p>
<p>English translation of Confucian ethics is usually called
“sincerity“’-</p>
<p>is that individual behavior which is truly appropriate to the
specific</p>
<p>relationship of mutual dependence because it optimizes benefits
for</p>
<p>both parties. Other behavior is insincere and therefore wrong
behavior</p>
<p>and unethical. It creates dissonance instead of harmony,
exploitation</p>
<p>instead of benefits, manipulation instead of trust.</p>
<p>An example of the Confucian approach to the ethical problems</p>
<p>discussed under the heading of business ethics would be sexual
harass-</p>
<p>ment. To the Confucian it is clearly unethical behavior because
it</p>
<p>injects power into a relationship that is based on function. This
makes</p>
<p>it exploitation. That this insincere-that is, grossly
unethical-behav-</p>
<p>ior on the part of a superior takes place within a business or any
other</p>
<p>kind of organization, is basically irrelevant. The masterlservant or
su-</p>
<p>periorlsubordinate relationship is one between individuals. Hence,
the</p>
<p>Confucian would make no distinction between a general manager</p>
<p>forcing his secretary into sexual intercourse and Mr. Samuel
Pepys,</p>
<p>England’s famous seventeenth-century diarist, forcing his wife’s</p>
<p>maids to submit to his amorous advances. It would not even make</p>
<p>much difference to the Confucian that today’s secretary can, as a
rule,</p>
<p>quit without suffering more than inconvenience if she does not want
to</p>
<p>submit, whereas the poor wretches in Mrs. Pepys’ employ ended up
as</p>
<p>prostitutes, either because they did not submit and were fired and
out</p>
<p>on the street, or because they did submit and were fired when they
got</p>
<p>pregnant. Nor would the Confucian see much difference between a</p>
<p>corporation vice president engaging in sexual harassment and a
college</p>
<p>professor seducing coeds with implied promises to raise their
grades.</p>
<p>And, finally, it would be immaterial to the Confucian that the</p>
<p>particular insincerity involves sexual relations. The superior would
be</p>
<p>equally guilty of grossly unethical behavior and violation of
fundamen-</p>
<p>al rules of conduct if, as a good many of the proponents of
business</p>
<p>ethics ardently advocate, he were to set himself up as a mental
thera-</p>
<p>pist for his subordinates and help them to adjust. No matter how
be-</p>
<p>nevolent his intentions, this is equally incompatible with the
integrity</p>
<p>of the superior/subordinate relationship. It equally abuses rank
based</p>
<p>on function and imposes power. It is therefore exploitation
whether</p>
<p>done because of lust for power or manipulation or done out of
benevo-</p>
<p>lence-either way it is unethical and destructive. Both sexual
relations</p>
<p>Can There Be “Business Ethics“? 209</p>
<p>and the healerlpatient relationship must be free of rank to be
effective,</p>
<p>harmonious, and ethically correct. They are constructive only as
friend</p>
<p>o friend or as husband to wife relations, in which differences in</p>
<p>function confer no rank whatever.</p>
<p>This example makes it clear, I would say, that virtually all the</p>
<p>concerns of business ethics, indeed almost everything business
ethics</p>
<p>considers a problem, have to do with relationships of
interdependence,</p>
<p>whether that between the organization and the employee, the
manufac-</p>
<p>urer and the customer, the hospital and the patient, the university
and</p>
<p>he student, and so on.</p>
<p>Looking at the ethics of interdependence immediately resolves the</p>
<p>conundrum which confounds the present discussion of business
ethics:</p>
<p>What difference does it make whether a certain act or behavior
takes</p>
<p>place in a business, in a nonprofit organization, or outside any
organi-</p>
<p>zation at all? The answer is clear: none at all. Indeed the questions
that</p>
<p>are so hotly debated in today’s discussion of business ethics, such
as</p>
<p>whether changing a hospital from “nonprofit“ to “proprietary and
for</p>
<p>profit“ will affect either its behavior or the ethics pertaining to
it, the</p>
<p>most cursory exposure to the ethics of interdependence reveals as</p>
<p>sophistry and as nonquestions.</p>
<p>The ethics of interdependence thus does address itself to the
ques-</p>
<p>ion which business ethics tries to tackle. But today’s
discussion,</p>
<p>explicitly or implicitly, denies the basic insight from which the
ethics</p>
<p>of interdependence starts and to which it owes its strength and
dura-</p>
<p>bility: It denies interdependence.</p>
<p>The ethics of interdependence, as Confucian philosophers first
cod-</p>
<p>ified it shortly after their Master’s death in 479 B.C.,
considers</p>
<p>illegitimate and unethical the injection of power into human
relation-</p>
<p>ships. It asserts that interdependence demands equality of
obligations.</p>
<p>Children owe obedience and respect to their parents. Parents, in
turn,</p>
<p>owe affection, sustenance and, yes, respect, to their children.
For</p>
<p>every paragon of filial piety in Confucian hagiology, such as the</p>
<p>dutiful daughter, there is a paragon of parental sacrifice, such as
the</p>
<p>loving father who sacrificed his brilliant career at the court to the
care</p>
<p>of his five children and their demands on his time and attention.
For</p>
<p>every minister who risks his job, if not his life, by fearlessly
correcting</p>
<p>an Emperor guilty of violating harmony, there is an Emperor
laying</p>
<p>down his life rather than throw a loyal minister to the political
wolves.</p>
<p>In the ethics of interdependence there are only obligations, and
all</p>
<p>obligations are mutual obligations. Harmony and trust-that is,
inter-</p>
<p>dependence-require that each side be obligated to provide what
the</p>
<p>other side needs to achieve its goals and to fulfill itself.</p>
<p>But in today’s American-and European–discussion of business</p>
<p>ethics, ethics means that one side has obligations and the other side
has</p>
<p>rights, if not entitlements. This is not compatible with the ethics
of</p>
<p>interdependence and indeed with any ethics at all. It is the politics
of</p>
<p>power, and indeed the politics of naked exploitation and
repression.</p>
<p>And within the context of interdependence the exploiters and the</p>
<p>oppressors are not the bosses, but the ones who assert their
rights</p>
<p>rather than accept mutual obligation, and with it, equality. To
redress</p>
<p>he balance in a relationship of interdependence-r at least so the</p>
<p>ethics of interdependence would insist–demands not pitting power</p>
<p>against power or right against right, but matching obligation to
obliga-</p>
<p>ion.</p>
<p>To illustrate: Today’s ethics of organization debate pays great
atten-</p>
<p>ion to the duty to be a “whistle-blower“ and to the protection of
the</p>
<p>whistle-blower against retaliation or suppression by his boss or by
his</p>
<p>organization. This sounds high-minded. Surely, the subordinate has
a</p>
<p>right, if not indeed a duty, to bring to public attention and
remedial</p>
<p>action his superior’s misdeeds, let alone violation of the law on the
part</p>
<p>of a superior or of his employing organization. But in the context of
the</p>
<p>ethics of interdependence, whistle-blowing is ethically quite
ambigu-</p>
<p>ous. To be sure, there are misdeeds of the superior or of the
employing</p>
<p>organizations which so grossly violate propriety and laws that
the</p>
<p>subordinate (or the friend, or the child, or even the wife) cannot
remain</p>
<p>silent. This is, after all, what the word “felony“ implies; one
becomes</p>
<p>a partner to a felony and criminally liable by not reporting, and
thus</p>
<p>compounding it. But otherwise? It is not primarily that to
encourage</p>
<p>whistle-blowing corrodes that bond of trust that ties the superior to
the</p>
<p>subordinate. Encouraging the whistle-blower must make the
subordi-</p>
<p>nate lose his trust in the superior’s willingness and ability to
protect his</p>
<p>people. They simply are no longer his people and become potential</p>
<p>enemies or political pawns. And in the end, encouraging and
indeed</p>
<p>even permitting whistle-blowers always makes the weaker one-that</p>
<p>is, the subordinate-powerless against the unscrupulous superior,
sim-</p>
<p>Can There Be “Business Ethics“? 211</p>
<p>ply because the superior no longer can recognize or meet his
obligation</p>
<p>o the subordinate.</p>
<p>Whistle-blowing, after all, is simply another word for informing.</p>
<p>And perhaps it is not quite irrelevant that the only societies in
Western</p>
<p>history that encouraged informers were bloody and infamous</p>
<p>yrannies-Tiberius and Nero in Rome, the Inquisition in the Spain
of</p>
<p>Philip 11, the French Terror, and Stalin. It may also be no accident
that</p>
<p>Mao, when he tried to establish a dictatorship in China,
organized</p>
<p>whistle-blowing on a massive scale. For under whistle-blowing,
under</p>
<p>he regime of the informer, no mutual trust, no interdependencies,
and</p>
<p>no ethics are possible. And Mao only followed history’s first
total-</p>
<p>itarians, the “Legalists“ of the third century B.C., who
suppressed</p>
<p>Confucius and burned his books because he had taught ethics and
had</p>
<p>rejected the absolutism of political power.</p>
<p>The limits of mutual obligation are indeed a central and
difficult</p>
<p>issue in the ethics of interdependencies. But to start out, as
the</p>
<p>advocates of whistle-blowing do, with the assumption that there
are</p>
<p>only rights on one side, makes any ethics impossible. And if the</p>
<p>fundamental problem of ethics is the behavior in relations of
interde-</p>
<p>pendence, then obligations have to be mutual and have to be equal
for</p>
<p>both sides. Indeed, in a relationship of interdependence it is
the</p>
<p>mutuality of obligation that creates true equality, regardless of
differ-</p>
<p>ences in rank, wealth, or power.</p>
<p>Today’s discussion of business ethics stridently denies this.It
tends</p>
<p>o assert that in relations of interdependence one side has all the
duties</p>
<p>and the other one all the rights. But this is the assertion of the
Legalist,</p>
<p>he assertion of the totalitarians who shortly end up by denying
all</p>
<p>ethics. It must also mean that ethics becomes the tool of the
powerful.</p>
<p>If a set of ethics is one-sided, then the rules are written by those
that</p>
<p>have the position, the power, the wealth. If interdependence is
not</p>
<p>equality of obligations, it becomes domination.</p>
<p>Looking at business ethics as an ethics of interdependence reveals
an</p>
<p>additional and equally serious problem-indeed a more serious
prob-</p>
<p>lem.</p>
<p>Can an ethics of interdependence be anything more than ethics for</p>
<p>individuals? The Confucians say no-a main reason why Mao out-</p>
<p>lawed them. For the Confucian-but also for the philosopher of the</p>
<p>Western tradition–only law can handle the rights and objections
of</p>
<p>collectives. Ethics is always a matter of the person.</p>
<p>But is this adequate for a society of organizations such as ours?
This</p>
<p>may be the central question for the philosopher of modern society,
in</p>
<p>which access to livelihood, career, and achievement exist primarily
in</p>
<p>and through organizations-and especially for the highly educated</p>
<p>person for whom opportunities outside of organization are very
scarce</p>
<p>indeed. In such a society, both the society and the individual
increas-</p>
<p>ingly depend on the performance, as well as the sincerity, of
organiza-</p>
<p>ions.</p>
<p>But in today’s discussion of business ethics it is not even seen
that</p>
<p>here is a problem.</p>
<p>“Ethical Chic“ or Ethics</p>
<p>Business ethics, this discussion should have made clear, is to
ethics</p>
<p>what soft porn is to the Platonic Eros; soft porn too talks of
something</p>
<p>it calls “love.“ And insofar as business ethics comes even close
to</p>
<p>ethics, it comes close to casuistry and will, predictably, end up as
a fig</p>
<p>leaf for the shameless and as special pleading for the powerful and
the</p>
<p>wealthy.</p>
<p>Clearly, one major element of the peculiar stew that goes by the</p>
<p>name of business ethics is plain old-fashioned hostility to business
and</p>
<p>o economic activity altogether–one of the oldest of American
tradi-</p>
<p>ions and perhaps the only still-potent ingredient in the Puritan
heri-</p>
<p>age. Otherwise, we would not even talk of business ethics. There is
no</p>
<p>warrant in any ethics to consider one major sphere of activity as
having</p>
<p>its own ethical problems, let alone its own ethics. Business or
econom-</p>
<p>ic activity may have special political or legal dimensions as in
“busi-</p>
<p>ness and government,“ to cite the title of a once-popular college</p>
<p>course, or as in the antitrust laws. And business ethics may be
good</p>
<p>politics or good electioneering. But that is all. For ethics deals
with the</p>
<p>right actions of individuals. And then it surely makes no
difference</p>
<p>whether the setting is a community hospital, with the actors a
nursing</p>
<p>supervisor and the consumer a patient, or whether the setting is</p>
<p>National Universal General Corporation, the actors a quality
control</p>
<p>manager, and the consumer the buyer of a bicycle.</p>
<p>But one explanation for the popularity of business ethics is
surely</p>
<p>Can There Be “Business Ethics“? 213</p>
<p>also the human frailty of which Pascal accused the casuists of his
day:</p>
<p>he lust for power and prominence of a clerisy sworn to humility.</p>
<p>Business ethics is fashionable, and provides speeches at
conferences,</p>
<p>lecture fees, consulting assignments, and lots of publicity. And
surely</p>
<p>business ethics, with its tales of wrongdoing in high places, caters
also</p>
<p>o the age-old enjoyment of society gossip and to the prurience</p>
<p>which-it was, I believe, Rabelais who said it-makes it
fornication</p>
<p>when a peasant has a toss in the hay and romance when the prince
does</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Altogether, business ethics might well be called ethical chic
rather</p>
<p>han ethics-and indeed might be considered more a media event than</p>
<p>philosophy or morals.</p>
<p>But this discussion of the major approaches to ethics and of
their</p>
<p>concerns surely also shows that ethics has as much to say to the</p>
<p>individual in our society of organizations as they ever had to say to
say</p>
<p>o the individual in earlier societies. They are just as important and
just</p>
<p>as needed nowadays. And they surely require hard and serious
work.</p>
<p>A society of organizations is a society of interdependence. The</p>
<p>specific relationship which the Confucian philosopher postulated
as</p>
<p>universal and basic may not be adequate, or even appropriate, to</p>
<p>modern society and to the ethical problems within the modern
organi-</p>
<p>zation and between the modem organization and its clients,
customers,</p>
<p>and constituents. But the fundamental concepts surely are. Indeed,
if</p>
<p>here ever is a viable ethics of organization, it will almost
certainly</p>
<p>have to adopt the key concepts which have made Confucian ethics
both</p>
<p>durable and effective:</p>
<p>4 l e a r definition of the fundamental relationships;</p>
<p>-universal and general rules of conduct-that is, rules that are</p>
<p>binding on any one person or organization, according to its
rules,</p>
<p>function, and relationships;</p>
<p>-focus on right behavior rather than on avoiding wrongdoing, and</p>
<p>on behavior rather than on motives or intentions. And finally,</p>
<p>-an effective organization ethic, indeed an organization ethic
that</p>
<p>deserves to be seriously considered as ethics, will have to define
right</p>
<p>behavior as the behavior which optimizes each party’s benefits
and</p>
<p>hus makes the relationship harmonious, constructive, and mutually</p>
<p>beneficial.</p>
<p>But a society of organizations is also a society in which a great
many</p>
<p>people are unimportant and indeed anonymous by themselves, yet
are</p>
<p>highly visible, and matter as leaders in society. And thus it is a
society</p>
<p>hat must stress the Ethics of Prudence and self-development. It
must</p>
<p>expect its managers, executives, and professionals to demand of
them-</p>
<p>selves that they shun behavior they would not respect in others,
and</p>
<p>instead practice behavior appropriate to the sort of person they
would</p>
<p>want to see in the mirror in the morning.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No word has caused more misunderstanding in EastIWest relations than
“sin-</li>
</ol>
<p>cerity.“ To a Westerner, sincerity means “words that are true to
conviction and</p>
<p>feelings“; to an Easterner, sincerity means “actions that are
appropriate to a</p>
<p>specific relationship and make it harmonious and of optimum mutual
benefit.“ For</p>
<p>he Westerner, sincerity has to do with intentions, that is, with
morality; to the</p>
<p>Easterner, sincerity has to do with behavior, that is, with
ethics.</p>
