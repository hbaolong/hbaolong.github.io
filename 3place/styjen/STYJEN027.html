<h4 id="india-and-appropriate-technology">India and Appropriate
Technology</h4>
<p>“The big mistake Gandhi made was to advocate the spinning</p>
<p>wheel,“ said one influential Indian government economist. “It’s
much</p>
<p>oo efficient. With the unemployment and underemployment we have</p>
<p>in our villages the truly appropriate technology is the hand-held
spin-</p>
<p>dle, the spinning whorl.“ Yet this is hardly how the Indian
villagers</p>
<p>define “appropriate technology“ for themselves.</p>
<p>What struck me most when traveling in the winter of 1978-79 for</p>
<p>six weeks through rural India was not the pervasive poverty or
the</p>
<p>palpable unemployment; I had expected both. What I had not ex-</p>
<p>pected, however, were the four or five brand-new bicycles
standing</p>
<p>outside every one of the miserable hovels-and not one of them</p>
<p>chained or locked. There may still be more bullock carts in rural
India</p>
<p>han bicycles; there surely are still infinitely more bullock carts
than</p>
<p>here are small tractors. But what powers India’s Green
Revolution,</p>
<p>what has given the subcontinent a food surplus for the first time in
its</p>
<p>housands of years, is not the digging stick or the wooden plow. It
is</p>
<p>he ubiquitous gasoline pump in the tub well and the irrigation ditch
in</p>
<p>an arid land.</p>
<p>From every bullock cart, every camel cart, every pedicab, and
every</p>
<p>howdah on the back of an elephant there issue the strains of the
tran-</p>
<p>sistor radio. And the most crowded stand in every one of the
count-</p>
<p>less village markets is the one that sells motor scooters on the
install-</p>
<p>ment plan.</p>
<p>First published in The Wall Street Journal, 1979.</p>
<p>Much as it pains the Indian government economist and his boss,
the</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the bicycle, transistor radio, gasoline pump, and</p>
<p>motor scooter-rather than the spinning wheel, let alone the distaff
or</p>
<p>he spinning whorl-are indeed the appropriate technology for India</p>
<p>and for most developing countries. They create jobs and
purchasing</p>
<p>power-the distaff would destroy both.</p>
<p>No one in India could tell me what the economic policy of the</p>
<p>government is. The only governmental actions are expansion of al-</p>
<p>ready large government enterprises, unchecked growth of an
already</p>
<p>obese bureaucracy, and more bureaucratic regulations. The cabinet</p>
<p>cannot agree on anything and has no policy whatever. Substantial
sums</p>
<p>are being allocated to the villages but without programs, let
alone</p>
<p>goals. But there is a pervasive rhetoric of smallness and of
antitechnol-</p>
<p>ogy.</p>
<p>India’s Prime Minister at the time of my trip (i.e., before Mrs.</p>
<p>Gandhi’s return to power), Morarji Desai, eighty-four years old
but</p>
<p>looking fifty-five (which he attributes to his eating only raw
mashed</p>
<p>vegetables and drinking his own urine), preached to me “small is</p>
<p>beautiful, “ “rural development, “ and “appropriate [that is,
prein-</p>
<p>dustrial] technology.“ It is this rhetoric that his economic
adviser</p>
<p>echoes when he counsels a return to the spinning whorl. And
pretty</p>
<p>much the same rhetoric can now be heard in many developing coun-</p>
<p>ries, for example in Indonesia or from the Islamic fundamentalists
in</p>
<p>Iran. It is very much the same rhetoric that underlay the
disastrous</p>
<p>Great Leap Forward in Maoist China twenty years ago, with its</p>
<p>emphasis on the village and on backyard steel furnaces.</p>
<p>As a reaction to the delusion of “the bigger the better,“ which</p>
<p>enthralled earlier Indian governments, especially Nehru, Desai’s
em-</p>
<p>phasis on rural India was overdue. Earlier governments neglected
the</p>
<p>village, where 90 percent of India’s 550 million people still live.
But</p>
<p>“small is beautiful“ is just as much a delusion as “the bigger
the</p>
<p>better.’’ What is appropriate is not what uses the most capital or
the</p>
<p>most labor; it is not what is “small“ or “big,“ “preindustrial“ or
a</p>
<p>“scientific marvel.“ What is appropriate is quite simply what
makes</p>
<p>he economy’s resources most productive. What is appropriate in a</p>
<p>country of huge population and rapid population growth is what
multi-</p>
<p>plies productive jobs. What is development in a country which
like</p>
<p>India has sizable resources of managerial and entrepreneurial skill
and</p>
<p>India and Appropriate Technology 301</p>
<p>at the same time huge unfulfilled consumer needs is whatever
creates</p>
<p>purchasing power.</p>
<p>Steel mills, those prestige investments of the 1960s into which</p>
<p>earlier Indian governments poured very large chunks of the
country’s</p>
<p>scarce capital resources, are becoming the white elephants of the
1970s</p>
<p>and 1980s. Steel mills are inappropriate technology for a country
like</p>
<p>India. They are highly capital-intensive rather than
labor-intensive.</p>
<p>They supply a commodity which is in ample supply on the world</p>
<p>market and available everywhere at a low price. Above all, they
create</p>
<p>practically no jobs beyond those in the mill itself.</p>
<p>But the automotive industry-passenger cars, motorbikes, trucks,</p>
<p>and tractors-is probably the most efficient multiplier of jobs
around.</p>
<p>Its own plants have a fairly high ratio of labor to capital, and the
indus-</p>
<p>ry generates about four to five secondary or tertiary jobs
throughout</p>
<p>he economy for every one in the manufacturing plant. It creates
jobs</p>
<p>in road building and road maintenance, in traffic control, in
dealer-</p>
<p>ships, service stations, and repair work. And it creates enormous</p>
<p>purchasing power with these jobs.</p>
<p>Similarly, making transistor radios and bicycles requires both a</p>
<p>large manufacturing base and a large dealer system; and both
multiply</p>
<p>jobs and create purchasing power. And like the automotive
industry,</p>
<p>both create human capital, that is, skills accessible to the
unlearned.</p>
<p>The same might be said for the manufacture of synthetic fertilizer
or</p>
<p>pharmaceuticals or pesticides-all require big enterprises and
national</p>
<p>distribution and service (moreover, these products, together with
the</p>
<p>gasoline pump, underlie the two great successes of India since
inde-</p>
<p>pendence: the rapid increase in food production and the rapid
decrease</p>
<p>in infant mortality).</p>
<p>Equally appropriate as a creator of productivity, jobs, and
purchas-</p>
<p>ing power is the cosmetics manufacturer, who may be quite small.
I</p>
<p>saw a highly efficient and highly successful multinational
cosmetics</p>
<p>firm in Bangalore which, with twenty employees, produces five
times</p>
<p>as much foreign exchange per rupee of investment or sales as any
of</p>
<p>he huge state-owned Indian enterprises.</p>
<p>The development decades of the fifties and sixties worshiped
capital</p>
<p>investment. The best testament to this superstition is The Stages
of</p>
<p>Economic Growth, which Walt W. Rostow, later President Johnson’s</p>
<p>foreign policy adviser, wrote in the early 1960s and which then</p>
<p>became the bible of the developing countries. Mr. Rostow
proclaimed</p>
<p>hat development is an automatic and direct function of the size
of</p>
<p>capital investment. But that is not productivity; it’s waste and
incom-</p>
<p>petence. Today there is a tendency to define productivity as
whatever</p>
<p>uses the most labor-specially in the developing countries, with
their</p>
<p>huge, unemployed, young population.</p>
<p>But that, too, is incompetence. Productivity is whatever
generates</p>
<p>he highest overall yield from an economy’s resources of capital,</p>
<p>labor, physical resources, and time. This will also give the
largest</p>
<p>number of jobs and the maximum purchasing power. It will even</p>
<p>produce the lowest possible inequality in the distribution of
incomes</p>
<p>attainable at a given stage of economic development. And surely
poor</p>
<p>countries cannot afford to support unproductive poeple-that is,
peo-</p>
<p>ple who appear busy winding a few strands of cotton around a
wooden</p>
<p>staff. Rich countries may be able to keep unproductive people
gain-</p>
<p>fully unemployed, but poor countries have no surplus to
distribute.</p>
<p>Above all, the troubadours of “small is beautiful“ forget-as does</p>
<p>so much of official Washington-that a healthy economy and society</p>
<p>need both the large and the small. Indeed, the two are
interdependent</p>
<p>in both a developed and developing country. There can be no small</p>
<p>manufacturer in a large market-whether that of the United States or
of</p>
<p>India-unless there is a large assembler or a large retailer, an IBM,
a</p>
<p>GM, a Sears Roebuck. It is only in their products or their stores
that</p>
<p>he small man’s output can reach the market. But there would also
be</p>
<p>no GM except for the existence of a multitude of small autonomous</p>
<p>ool-and-die shops and a host of small parts suppliers, or local
dealers,</p>
<p>service stations, and repair shops.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical research requires big-if not very big–enterprises.</p>
<p>But pharmaceutical sales depend on some 200,000 drugstores and</p>
<p>200,000 physicians-ach of necessity decentralized and indeed au-</p>
<p>onomous. Rural development in India not only means national mar-</p>
<p>keting organizations for village products and national credit and
bank-</p>
<p>ing institutions. It means huge power stations. Above
all-something</p>
<p>he advocates of “small is beautiful“ always conveniently
overlook-</p>
<p>it means centralized government bureaucracies, which surely could
not</p>
<p>be called “small“ whether or not they deserve to be called
“beauti-</p>
<p>ful. “</p>
<p>None of these arguments, 1, am afraid, made much impact on the</p>
<p>India and Appropriate Technology 303</p>
<p>Indian government economist-nor I realized would they have made</p>
<p>much impact on his Prime Minister. But once Indians have the
bicycle,</p>
<p>he motor scooter, the transistor radio, and the gasoline pumps,
are</p>
<p>hey really going to go back to the spinning whorl?</p>
