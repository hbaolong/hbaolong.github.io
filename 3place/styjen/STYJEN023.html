<h4 id="the-hostile-takeover-and-its-discontents">The Hostile Takeover
and Its Discontents</h4>
<p>Almost every week these last few years there has been a report of</p>
<p>another “hostile takeover bid,“ another stock-market maneuver to</p>
<p>ake over, merge, or split up an existing publicly held company
against</p>
<p>determined opposition by the company’s board of directors and
man-</p>
<p>agement. No such wave of stock-market speculation has hit the
United</p>
<p>States since the “bears“ and the “bulls“ of the 1870s, when the</p>
<p>Goulds and the Drews and the Vanderbilts battled each other for</p>
<p>control of American railroads. The new wave of hostile takeovers
has</p>
<p>already profoundly altered the contours and landmarks of the
Ameri-</p>
<p>can economy. It has become a dominant force-many would say the</p>
<p>dominant force-in the behavior and actions of American manage-</p>
<p>ment, and, almost certainly, a major factor in the erosion of
American</p>
<p>competitive and technological leadership. Yet the papers usually
report</p>
<p>it only on the financial page. And very few people, outside of
busi-</p>
<p>ness, really quite know what goes on or, indeed, what a hostile</p>
<p>akeover really is.</p>
<p>The hostile takeover usually begins with a raider-a company or</p>
<p>an individual who is legally incorporated and works through a</p>
<p>corporation-buying a small percentage of the target company’s
share</p>
<p>capital on the open market, usually with money borrowed expressly
for</p>
<p>his purpose. When, and as the raider expects, the target’s board
of</p>
<p>directors and its management spurn his takeover bid, the raider
bor-</p>
<p>rows more money-sometimes several billion dollars-buys more of</p>
<p>First published in The Public Interest, 1986.</p>
<p>he target’s shares on the market, and goes directly to the
target’s</p>
<p>stockholders, offering them substantially more than the current
share</p>
<p>price on the stock exchange. If enough of the target’s
shareholders</p>
<p>accept to give the raider complete control, he then typically
unloads</p>
<p>he debt he has incurred in the takeover onto the company he has</p>
<p>acquired. In a hostile takeover the victim thus ends up paying for
his</p>
<p>own execution.</p>
<p>The raider not only now controls a big company: he has made a
tidy</p>
<p>profit on the shares he bought at the lower market price. Even if
the</p>
<p>akeover attempt fails, the raider usually wins big. The target may
only</p>
<p>be able to escape the raider by finding a white knight, that is,
someone</p>
<p>who is less odious to the management of the target company and</p>
<p>willing to pay even more for its shares, including those held by
the</p>
<p>raider. Alternatively, the target company pays ransom to the
raider-</p>
<p>which goes by the Robin Hood-like name of greenmail-and buys out</p>
<p>he shares the raider acquired at a fancy price, way beyond anything
its</p>
<p>earnings and prospects could justify.</p>
<p>Hostile takeovers were virtually unknown before 1980. Harold</p>
<p>Geneen, who built ITT into the world’s largest and most
diversified</p>
<p>conglomerate in the 1960s and 1970s, made literally hundreds of
ac-</p>
<p>quisitions-perhaps as many as a thousand. But he never made an</p>
<p>offer to a company unless its management had first invited him to
do</p>
<p>so. Indeed, in a good many of Geneen’s acquisitions the original</p>
<p>initiative came from the company to be acquired; it offered itself
for</p>
<p>sale. In those days it would have been impossible to finance
hostile</p>
<p>akeovers: no bank would have lent money for such a purpose. But</p>
<p>since 1980 they have become increasingly easy to finance.</p>
<p>At first, hostile takeovers were launched by large companies
intent</p>
<p>on rapid growth or rapid diversification. This phase reached a
climax</p>
<p>in 1982 with a months-long battle of three giants: Bendix (defense
and</p>
<p>automotive), Martin-Marietta (defense, aerospace, and cement),
and</p>
<p>Allied (chemicals). Bendix began the fight with a hostile takeover
bid</p>
<p>for Martin-Marietta, which promptly counterattacked with a
hostile</p>
<p>akeover bid for Bendix. When these two, like two scorpions in a</p>
<p>bottle, had finished each other off, Allied joined the fray, paid
ransom</p>
<p>o an exhausted Martin-Marietta, took over Bendix, and in the
process</p>
<p>ousted the Bendix management that had started the battle.</p>
<p>Since then, raiders increasingly are individual stock-market
opera-</p>
<p>The Hostile Takeover and Its Discontents 251</p>
<p>ors whose business is the hostile takeover. Some, like Carl
Icahn,</p>
<p>range over the lot, attacking all kinds of business. T. Boone
Pickens,</p>
<p>originally a small, independent oil producer, specializes in large
petro-</p>
<p>leum companies-his targets have included such major companies as</p>
<p>Gulf Oil, Phillips Petroleum, and Union Oil. Ted Turner of
Atlanta</p>
<p>specializes in the media and was embroiled in a hostile takeover bid
for</p>
<p>he smallest of the three television networks, CBS. But there are</p>
<p>dozens of smaller raiders abroad, many of them looking for fast-</p>
<p>growing medium-size companies, especially companies in such cur-</p>
<p>rently “sexy“ fields as electronics, computers, or biotechnology.</p>
<p>Others primarily raid financial institutions. Practically all of them
do</p>
<p>so on money borrowed at high interest rates.</p>
<p>Why the Raider Succeeds</p>
<p>How many hostile takeover bids there have been, no one quite</p>
<p>knows. Conservative estimates run to four hundred or five
hundred,</p>
<p>with at least one-half ending in the disappearance of the target
compa-</p>
<p>ny either because the raider succeeds or because the target finds
a</p>
<p>white knight. Such a massive phenomenon-whether considered de-</p>
<p>structive or constructive-surely bespeaks fundamental changes in
the</p>
<p>underlying economic structure and the environment of American
busi-</p>
<p>ness and the American economy. Yet to my knowledge there has so
far</p>
<p>been practically no discussion of what might explain the takeover</p>
<p>phenomenon, of its meaning, and of the policy questions it
raises.</p>
<p>What, for instance, explains the vulnerability of companies,
among</p>
<p>hem a good many big, strong, well-established ones? Few of the</p>
<p>raiders have much financial strength of their own. Most have
little</p>
<p>managerial or business achievement behind them. In the 1960s and</p>
<p>early 1970s, the managements of big, publicly owned companies
were</p>
<p>widely believed to be impregnable; nothing short of the company’s</p>
<p>bankruptcy could threaten, let alone dislodge, them. It was then</p>
<p>considered almost a “self-evident truth“ in highly popular books</p>
<p>(those of John Kenneth Galbraith, for instance) that we had moved
into</p>
<p>“corporate capitalism“ as a new and distinct “stage,“ one in
which</p>
<p>professional managers perpetuated themselves and ran the
country’s</p>
<p>big business autonomously, ruling without much interference from
any</p>
<p>of their supposed “constituencies.“ But in the last few years,
any</p>
<p>number of companies, and particularly large companies doing well
by</p>
<p>any yardstick, have been swallowed up by hitherto unknown and</p>
<p>obscure newcomers despite the most vigorous defense by their man-</p>
<p>agement.</p>
<p>These raiders often have no capital of their own, but have to
borrow</p>
<p>every penny they need to buy a small percentage of the company’s</p>
<p>stock and then to make their takeover bid. By now, to bar a
hostile</p>
<p>akeover bid even giants like General Motors are forced into
expensive</p>
<p>and complicated subterfuges such as splitting their shares into a
num-</p>
<p>ber of different issues, each with different voting rights. What
has</p>
<p>happened to corporate capitalism and to the absolute control by
profes-</p>
<p>sional autonomous management, seemingly so firmly established
only</p>
<p>a little while ago?</p>
<p>Fundamentally, there are three explanations for this extreme vul-</p>
<p>nerability of established companies to the hostile takeover.</p>
<p>One explanation is inflation.</p>
<p>Then there are structural changes within the economy that make a</p>
<p>good many of yesterday’s most successful companies no longer
appro-</p>
<p>priate to today’s economic realities.</p>
<p>Finally, corporate capitalism-that is, the establishment of a
man-</p>
<p>agement accountable only to itself-has made managements and com-</p>
<p>panies exceedingly vulnerable. They have no constituencies to come
to</p>
<p>heir succor when attacked.</p>
<p>Inflation distorts: It distorts values. It distorts relationships. It
cre-</p>
<p>ates glaring discrepancies between economic assumptions and eco-</p>
<p>nomic realities. The fifteen years of inflation in America which
began</p>
<p>during Lyndon Johnson’s presidency and continued into the early</p>
<p>1980s were no exception. And the most predictable, indeed the
most</p>
<p>ypical, distortion of inflation is between the value of assets and
their</p>
<p>earning power. In any inflation the cost of capital goods tends to
rise</p>
<p>much faster than the price of the goods they produce. It thus
becomes</p>
<p>economical to buy already existing capital assets rather than to
invest</p>
<p>in new facilities and new machines. So any company that is rich
in</p>
<p>fixed assets is worth more when dismembered-that is, when its</p>
<p>capital assets are being sold as pieces of real estate, as factories,
as</p>
<p>machinery and equipment-than it is worth on a realistic
pricelearn-</p>
<p>ings ratio based on the value of its output. This is one of the
distortions</p>
<p>hat the raiders exploit.</p>
<p>The Hostile Takeover and Its Discontents 253</p>
<p>The stock market values companies on the basis of their earnings.
It</p>
<p>values them, in other words, as “going concerns.“ It does not
value</p>
<p>hem on their liquidation value. As a result, a company heavy with</p>
<p>fixed assets-and especially a company that also has a lot of cash
with</p>
<p>which the raider, after the takeover, can repay himself (and make
a</p>
<p>sizable profit to boot )-becomes a most inviting target. This
situation</p>
<p>accounts for one-quarter, perhaps even one-third, of all the
successful</p>
<p>hostile takeovers.</p>
<p>Equally important are the tremendous structural changes in the</p>
<p>American and world economies in the last fifteen years. They have</p>
<p>made inappropriate a good many of the traditional forms of
economic</p>
<p>integration. The best example is probably the large, integrated
petro-</p>
<p>leum company. One need not sympathize with Mr. T. Boone Pickens,</p>
<p>he raider who successfully forced one of the country’s largest
and</p>
<p>proudest petroleum companies, Gulf Oil, into a shotgun marriage
with</p>
<p>a white knight and almost succeeded in taking over two other old
and</p>
<p>well-established petroleum companies, Union Oil and Phillips. But</p>
<p>Pickens has a point. He has forced the petroleum companies at
which</p>
<p>he leveled his guns to do something sensible: that is, to split
the</p>
<p>company into two parts, one making and selling petroleum
products,</p>
<p>one keeping reserves of crude oil in the ground.</p>
<p>Large integrated petroleum companies have performed poorly since</p>
<p>1980 or 1981. Their earnings basically reflect a crude oil price
of</p>
<p>around 2 or 5 a barrel, which is what the market price would have</p>
<p>been all along had there been no OPEC cartel. But all of them
have</p>
<p>ried desperately, since the OPEC oil shock of 1973, to build up</p>
<p>underground crude oil reserves for the future. And these reserves
were</p>
<p>priced in the market, and especially by people looking for a
long-term</p>
<p>ax shelter, on the expectation of a petroleum price many times
the</p>
<p>present price, twenty or thirty years hence. In fact, to justify what
the</p>
<p>market was paying for crude and crude oil reserves in the ground,
one</p>
<p>would have to assume a petroleum price of around 00 a barrel by</p>
<p>he year 2015 or so; otherwise, on a discounted cash-flow basis,
the</p>
<p>present valuation of these proven underground reserves could not
pos-</p>
<p>sibly be justified.</p>
<p>Whether the expectation of high petroleum prices twenty or thirty</p>
<p>years hence is rational is not the point. (Every historical
experience</p>
<p>would indicate that the only rational expectation is for the
petroleum</p>
<p>prices thirty years hence to be lower than they are today-but this
is</p>
<p>another issue.) The fact is that it makes little sense today to be
an</p>
<p>“integrated“ petroleum company. The interests of the people who</p>
<p>want the earnings of the present petroleum company, and the
interests</p>
<p>of the people who look for a long-term tax shelter (and who, in
other</p>
<p>words, do not care much about present earnings), are not
compatible.</p>
<p>Therefore Pickens’s proposal, that the integrated petroleum
company</p>
<p>split itself into two pieces, made sense.</p>
<p>A similar situation exists in the steel industry, and in fact in a
good</p>
<p>many of the traditional large-scale, integrated, capital-intensive
mate-</p>
<p>rials producers. Every one of these situations invites a raider.</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest single reason companies are vulnerable to</p>
<p>he raider is “corporate capitalism“ itself: that is, autonomous
man-</p>
<p>agement, accountable to no one, controlled by no one, and without</p>
<p>constituents. It has made management arrogant. And far from
making</p>
<p>management powerful, corporate capitalism has actually made it
impo-</p>
<p>ent. Management has become isolated and has lost its support base,
in</p>
<p>its own board of directors, among its own stockholders, and among
its</p>
<p>own employees.</p>
<p>Wherever a management threatened by a raider has been able to</p>
<p>organize a “constituency,“ it has beaten off the hostile takeover.
One</p>
<p>example is Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, which
mo-</p>
<p>bilized the employees and the community; this was enough to
defeat</p>
<p>Pickens. But where managements have given in to the temptation to</p>
<p>become omnipotent they have in effect rendered themselves
impotent.</p>
<p>When they are then attacked, they have nobody to support them if</p>
<p>someone offers a few dollars above the current market price to
the</p>
<p>company shareholders.</p>
<p>Where the Cash Comes From</p>
<p>The vulnerability of the victims does not, by itself, explain how
the</p>
<p>raiders finance their takeover. To mount a hostile takeover bid for
a</p>
<p>large company takes a very large war chest. One and a half
billion</p>
<p>dollars is just about the minimum needed to attack a big company.
In</p>
<p>some recent cases the amount went up to billion. It has to be in</p>
<p>cash, as a rule. To be sure, if the takeover bid succeeds, the
target</p>
<p>company then pays. But the money has to be available from the</p>
<p>The Hostile Takeover and Its Discontents 255</p>
<p>beginning-that is, when it is by no means sure that the takeover
bid</p>
<p>will succeed. If the takeover bid is launched by an individual, as
more</p>
<p>and more of them have been in recent years, there usually is no</p>
<p>security whatever for the cash that the raider has to borrow. The
raider</p>
<p>himself usually has negligible assets, certainly compared to the
sums</p>
<p>needed. Even if the takeover bid is being launched by another
large</p>
<p>company, the amount needed to finance it is usually way beyond</p>
<p>anything the company could normally raise as additional debt. Yet
the</p>
<p>only “security“ for the loan that a raider has to obtain is the
promise</p>
<p>of repayment if the raid is successful. This is hardly what was
once</p>
<p>normally considered a “bankable“ loan, yet the raiders have had
no</p>
<p>difficulty obtaining these loans. Indeed, when the financing of
hostile</p>
<p>akeover bids switched (mostly for regulatory reasons) from being</p>
<p>done by means of bank loans to being done by means of bonds, the</p>
<p>market promptly named the bonds junk bonds, and with good reason.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is no difficulty in getting such bonds
underwritten</p>
<p>and issued, with commercial banks being avid buyers.</p>
<p>Bank loans-or junk bonds-to finance hostile takeovers are avail-</p>
<p>able for the same reason that enabled countries like Brazil, Zaire,
or</p>
<p>Argentina, in the early 1980s, to obtain loans from Western banks
in</p>
<p>amounts that were clearly beyond their capacity to pay interest on
(let</p>
<p>alone to repay the loan itself), and for the same reason that
large</p>
<p>money-center banks, such as Continental Illinois in Chicago, were</p>
<p>willing, indeed eager, to snap up highly speculative and
sometimes</p>
<p>fraudulent loans often to nonexistent oil and gas speculators.
The</p>
<p>American commercial bank is pinched by the shrinkage of its
tradition-</p>
<p>al sources of income and almost desperate to find new ones, and</p>
<p>especially to find borrowers willing to pay very high interest
rates.</p>
<p>And the raider who makes a hostile takeover bid is, of course,
perfect-</p>
<p>ly willing to promise very high interest rates; after all, he will
not pay</p>
<p>hem-the company he is aiming to take over will, after it has suc-</p>
<p>cumbed.</p>
<p>Commercial banks, as every textbook states, make their living as</p>
<p>liquidity arbitrageurs: They obtain their money from “demand
depos-</p>
<p>its“ which have perfect liquidity-that is, the right to withdraw
the</p>
<p>money at any time. The bank then lends out that money for longer</p>
<p>periods of time (from ninety days to three years is the ordinary
time</p>
<p>span of a commercial loan); so the amounts owed to the bank have
far</p>
<p>less liquidity than the amounts it owes. This, then, justifies the
bank’s</p>
<p>charging a substantially higher interest rate, with the difference
be-</p>
<p>ween the interest rate on what the bank lends out and the interest
rate</p>
<p>on what the bank borrows being the bank’s income.</p>
<p>Increasingly, this does not work anymore, for the bank either is
not</p>
<p>able to be the liquidity arbitrageur or does not get paid for it.
One</p>
<p>reason is, of course, the zero-interest demand deposits, once
pre-</p>
<p>scribed by the regulatory authorities, have all but disappeared.
Histori-</p>
<p>cally, businesses have provided the bulk of the demand deposits.
But</p>
<p>few businesses these days keep large cash supplies, and the
typical</p>
<p>checking account of individuals now pays 5.5 percent interest.
Adding</p>
<p>o this the costs of administration, acquisition, and so on, the
bank</p>
<p>probably ends up paying 8 or 9 percent for the money on deposit
in</p>
<p>customers’ checking accounts-which means that even demand depos-</p>
<p>its no longer provide a substantial “interest spread.“ And most
Ameri-</p>
<p>can consumers today keep in their checking account only a minimum</p>
<p>balance. The rest is in accounts that pay much higher interest, such
as</p>
<p>money-market accounts, which still allow high liquidity.</p>
<p>On the demand side, too, the liquidity arbitrage has become far
less</p>
<p>profitable. Increasingly, American businesses do not finance
them-</p>
<p>selves through commercial loans, but through commercial paper-the</p>
<p>business version of an installment loan. This, however, bypasses
the</p>
<p>banking system. The company with a temporary cash surplus
directly</p>
<p>buys commercial paper issued by another company with a temporary</p>
<p>cash need. But the “spread“ on commercial paper between what the</p>
<p>borrower pays and what the lender gets is much lower than that</p>
<p>between the traditional noninterest on demand deposits and the
bank’s</p>
<p>lending rate on commercial loans. That spread may be 1.5 percent
as</p>
<p>against 4 or 5 percent previously.</p>
<p>By now, most U.S. banks, especially the larger ones, know that</p>
<p>hey cannot hope to continue to build their business on the “spread“
of</p>
<p>interest rates between what they pay for their money and what
they</p>
<p>charge for it. They will have to shift their income base to fees
and</p>
<p>commissions. But even those few banks which accepted this ten
years</p>
<p>ago and which since then have been working hard on shifting their</p>
<p>source of income from being paid for money to being paid for
infor-</p>
<p>mation and service-Xitibank in New York was probably the first,</p>
<p>and is by far the leader-still have a very long way to go. And in
the</p>
<p>The Hostile Takeover and Its Discontents 257</p>
<p>meantime the banks are hurting for sources of income. Hence the</p>
<p>pressure on them to look for borrowers willing to pay higher
interest-</p>
<p>or at least to promise they will-whether they be Oklahoma
wildcat-</p>
<p>ers, military governments engulfed by inflation in their own
country</p>
<p>(such as Brazil and Argentina), or takeover raiders.</p>
<p>The Lure of Easy Money</p>
<p>That the raiders can obtain money they need still does not
explain</p>
<p>why the shareholders team up with the raider to take over, merge,
or</p>
<p>liquidate the company they own.</p>
<p>They do not do so, it is abundantly clear, because they believe
the</p>
<p>akeover will be advantageous to the company. On the contrary, the</p>
<p>shareholders clearly know that the takeover bid is usually a disaster
for</p>
<p>he company. Increasingly, they sell their shares to the raider only
if</p>
<p>hey get cash, that is, if they get out of the company and have
nothing</p>
<p>o do with it anymore. Or, if they take securities in exchange,
they</p>
<p>immediately sell them. And yet, again and again, the shareholders,
in</p>
<p>heir great majority, either accept the bid of the raider or turn it
down</p>
<p>only if a white knight offers more than the raider does. But then
they</p>
<p>also immediately sell whatever the white knight has given them in</p>
<p>exchange against their holdings in the company that has
disappeared.</p>
<p>The shareholders who control our large, publicly held companies</p>
<p>simply have no choice but to accept the raider’s offer. They are
forced,</p>
<p>perhaps even legally forced, to accept the raider’s bid if it is
higher</p>
<p>han the currently quoted price for the stock. This is essentially a
result</p>
<p>of the shift of share ownership from individuals to institutions who
are</p>
<p>“trustees, “ and especially to pension funds. Pension funds
(increas-</p>
<p>ingly also mutual funds) are the legal “owners“ of the publicly
owned</p>
<p>companies of America, with their holdings amounting to about 50</p>
<p>percent of the common shares. The percentage is even higher for
large</p>
<p>companies because the institutional holders concentrate on them.
The</p>
<p>people who manage these large and growing aggregations of
capital,</p>
<p>especially the pension fund managers, are trustees rather than
owners.</p>
<p>They are trustees both for the management of the companies which</p>
<p>owe the pensions to their employees and for the ultimate
beneficiaries,</p>
<p>he employees and future pensioners. As trustees they have,
however,</p>
<p>little choice about whether they want to sell their shares if
someone</p>
<p>bids substantially above what the same shares fetch at the market
price.</p>
<p>They have to accept. If they were to say no, they would lay
themselves</p>
<p>open to an enormous and uninsurable liability. The trustees could
be</p>
<p>sued by both the management of the company and the ultimate bene-</p>
<p>ficiaries, the employees, were those shares, six months later,
quoted</p>
<p>below the price the raider had offered. Trustees do not have the
right to</p>
<p>superimpose their judgment on what a “prudent man“ would do. And</p>
<p>a prudent man surely will take the bird in the hand, especially if
there</p>
<p>is no reason to believe that there is a bird in the bush.</p>
<p>Pension fund managers are also under tremendous pressure to show</p>
<p>better-than-average returns-and yet are unable to do so as a rule.
The</p>
<p>pension funds of most American businesses are defined-benefit
plans:</p>
<p>The company promises to pay the employee upon retirement a fixed</p>
<p>proportion of the employee’s salary, usually 60 percent or so of the
last</p>
<p>five years’ earnings. What the employee is to receive is fixed, or
rather</p>
<p>will be fixed by the time the employee reaches retirement. What
the</p>
<p>company contributes, however, is flexible. The contribution
payable</p>
<p>by the company goes down if the pension fund increases in
value-if,</p>
<p>for instance, it shows a high return or profit from its investments.
If the</p>
<p>pension fund does not show earnings, or shows earnings lower than</p>
<p>anticipated, the company’s contribution goes up.</p>
<p>This is in sharp contrast to plans based on a defined
contribution,</p>
<p>under which what the company pays in each year is fixed, with the</p>
<p>employee upon retirement receiving either a fixed stipend or a
variable</p>
<p>one which depends upon what the earnings of the pension fund have</p>
<p>been.</p>
<p>In the defined-benefit plan, therefore, management constantly</p>
<p>pushes the pension fund manager to show profits, especially from
in-</p>
<p>vestments, so that the company’s contribution can be minimized.
But</p>
<p>his is a total delusion. It is in fact an impossibility. The pension
funds</p>
<p>by now are the American stock market. And if one is the market,
one</p>
<p>cannot possibly beat it. The performance record of the pension
funds</p>
<p>bears this out. It has been abysmal, almost without exception. In
fact,</p>
<p>he desire to “beat the market“ is in itself the reason that most
pension</p>
<p>funds have performed substantially worse than the market. As a
result,</p>
<p>he pension funds waste their substance by supporting a huge stock</p>
<p>market that only fritters away in commissions the money that
should</p>
<p>go to the future beneficiaries. In the long and checkered history
of</p>
<p>The Hostile Takeover and Its Discontents 259</p>
<p>investment and finance, there is probably no more uniformly
dismal</p>
<p>record than that of American pension fund management in the last</p>
<p>wenty years.</p>
<p>And yet company managements still believe that their fund can</p>
<p>“beat the oddsH-the way each slot machine player in Las Vegas</p>
<p>believes that he can beat them. And the pension fund manager who</p>
<p>does not operate short term, and who refuses to speculate, to trade,
and</p>
<p>o show “results“ over the next three months, is likely to lose
the</p>
<p>account quickly. There is probably no more competitive industry</p>
<p>around. This makes irresistible an offer by the raider to pay 5 for
a</p>
<p>share that is quoted at 0 on the market.</p>
<p>Pension fund managers know that the raider’s bid is deleterious
to</p>
<p>he company whose stock they own. But they cannot consider the</p>
<p>welfare and interests of their “property.“ They are not owners.
They</p>
<p>are of necessity speculators, even though they are legally vested
with</p>
<p>he owner’s power. And so they behave as speculators. They have to</p>
<p>accept the raider’s bid unless a white knight makes a better
offer.</p>
<p>The Dangers of Defensiveness</p>
<p>The wave of hostile takeovers is a result of profound structural</p>
<p>changes in the American economy. But it is in itself a serious
disorder.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of discussion about whether hostile takeovers
are</p>
<p>good or bad for the shareholders. There can be absolutely no
doubt,</p>
<p>however, that they are exceedingly bad for the economy. They
force</p>
<p>management into operating short term. More and more of our busi-</p>
<p>nesses, large, medium-size, and small, are not being run for
business</p>
<p>results but for protection against the hostile takeover. This means
that</p>
<p>more and more of our businesses are forced to concentrate on
results</p>
<p>in the next three months. They are being run so as to encourage
the</p>
<p>institutional investors, on which all publicly traded companies
today</p>
<p>depend for their supply of capital, to hold onto the company
shares</p>
<p>rather than to toss them overboard the moment the first hostile
takeover</p>
<p>bid appears.</p>
<p>But worse still, companies are being forced to do stupid things
to</p>
<p>prevent themselves from being raided. It is, for instance,
becoming</p>
<p>dangerous for any company to be liquid. Liquidity can only attract
the</p>
<p>raider who can expect to repay himself, and the debt he incurs in</p>
<p>bidding for the company, out of the company’s own cash. And thus</p>
<p>companies who find themselves in a liquid position, no matter how</p>
<p>much cash they may need only a few months further on, hasten to</p>
<p>squander the cash-for instance, in buying up something that is
totally</p>
<p>alien to their own business and has only one advantage: it absorbs a
lot</p>
<p>of money. Even worse, companies increasingly cut back on expenses</p>
<p>for the future, such as research and development. One of the most</p>
<p>ominous developments for the future of America is the speed with</p>
<p>which the Japanese are taking over the markets of the rapidly
indus-</p>
<p>rializing countries: Brazil, for instance, or India. They do so
because</p>
<p>hey can invest in the distribution system in these countries in
anticipa-</p>
<p>ion of the future market. American company managements are per-</p>
<p>fectly aware of this. But when asked why they do not do likewise,
they</p>
<p>end to say, “We cannot afford to set aside this money and invest it
in</p>
<p>omorrow. We need it to make a good showing in next month’s or
next</p>
<p>quarter’s profits. “</p>
<p>The fear of the raider is undoubtedly the largest single cause for
the</p>
<p>increasing tendency of American companies to manage for the short</p>
<p>erm and let the future go hang. The fear of the raider demoralizes
and</p>
<p>paralyzes. The impact on the morale of management people and of</p>
<p>professional people in the company can hardly be overestimated.
And</p>
<p>worse still, after the successful takeover, the morale in a company
is</p>
<p>destroyed, often forever. The people who can leave, do. The others
do</p>
<p>heir minimum. “What’s the point in my trying to do a good job if
the</p>
<p>rug will be pulled out from under me tomorrow?“ is a frequent</p>
<p>comment. Add to this that the raiders, in order to reimburse
them-</p>
<p>selves, usually start out by selling off the company’s most
promising</p>
<p>businesses. Hence the impact of a takeover on morale is total
catastro-</p>
<p>phe.</p>
<p>Altogether, the record is poor for all companies that have been</p>
<p>merged, especially into a conglomerate or into a business with
which</p>
<p>hey had little in common: for example, the typical financial
conglom-</p>
<p>erate. Only three out of every ten such acquiring companies do as
well</p>
<p>wo years later as they did before the merger. But the record of</p>
<p>companies that have been acquired in a hostile takeover is
uniformly</p>
<p>dismal.</p>
<p>Clearly the hostile takeover cannot be justified as leading to a
more</p>
<p>efficient allocation of resources. Most of them have no aim except
to</p>
<p>enrich the raider. To achieve this end, he offers the stockholders
more</p>
<p>The Hostile Takeover and Its Discontents 261</p>
<p>money for their shares than they would get on the market, which is
to</p>
<p>say, he bribes them. And to be able to pay the bribe he loads a
heavy</p>
<p>debt on the company that is being taken over, which by itself
severely</p>
<p>impairs the company’s potential for economic performance. The
fact</p>
<p>hat, almost without exception, the result of the hostile takeover is
also</p>
<p>a demoralization and severe impairment of the human organization</p>
<p>disproves the argument that the hostile takeover results in a
more</p>
<p>efficient allocation of resources. Actually, all it proves is that
“re-</p>
<p>sources“ in the modem business enterprise are not primarily
bricks</p>
<p>and mortar–or even oil in the ground. They are the human
organiza-</p>
<p>ion.</p>
<p>There are indeed cases where a human organization becomes more</p>
<p>productive by being dissociated from its former enterprise, by
being</p>
<p>set up separately-in fact, a good many of today’s large
organizations,</p>
<p>and especially the conglomerates, would greatly increase their
produc-</p>
<p>ivity by being split into smaller units, or by establishing parts
as</p>
<p>separate businesses. But this is not what the hostile takeover
accom-</p>
<p>plishes. On the contrary, the most valuable parts of the acquired</p>
<p>business are invariably put on the block after a hostile takeover so
as to</p>
<p>raise money to pay off some of the debt. And this impairs both
their</p>
<p>productivity and that of the remaining assets.</p>
<p>There are serious questions about resource allocation in the
Ameri-</p>
<p>can economy. But the hostile takeover is clearly not the right tool
to</p>
<p>bring about a more efficient allocation. It does severe damage to
the</p>
<p>rue productive resource, the human organization, its spirit, its
dedica-</p>
<p>ion, its morale, its confidence in its management, and its
identifica-</p>
<p>ion with the enterprise that employs its people.</p>
<p>Even if hostile takeovers are “good for the shareholders“-and
they</p>
<p>are “good“ only for the very shortest time-they are surely not
good</p>
<p>for the economy. They are indeed so bad that we will be forced to
put</p>
<p>an end to them, one way or another.</p>
<p>One way to do so might be to emulate the British and create a</p>
<p>“takeover panel“ with the power to stop takeover bids considered
to</p>
<p>be contrary to the best long-term interest of the enterprise and
the</p>
<p>economy. Whether such a panel could be set up in this country-</p>
<p>or whether it would just become another troublesome government</p>
<p>agency-is very debatable. The way the British are doing it would</p>
<p>immediately run afoul of our antitrust laws.</p>
<p>It is therefore more probable that we will put an end to the
hostile</p>
<p>akeover-r at least put serious obstacles in its path-by
abandoning</p>
<p>he concept of “one share, one vote“ and go to shares that,
although</p>
<p>participating equally in profits (and in the proceeds of a
liquidation),</p>
<p>have unequal voting power, at least as long as the company shows</p>
<p>adequate financial results. General Motors has already gone this
way,</p>
<p>and quite a few smaller firms are following. This would not be a</p>
<p>radical departure. The British, for many years, had the private
limited</p>
<p>company, in which management held the voting power as long as it</p>
<p>showed specified results. Similarly, the Germans, for well over a</p>
<p>hundred years, have had the Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien, in</p>
<p>which management holds the majority of the voting power even
though</p>
<p>it has a very small minority of the share ownershipagain, as long
as</p>
<p>here is adequate performance and results. In other words, a shift to
a</p>
<p>system in which different classes of shares have differential
voting</p>
<p>power-with Class A shares, for instance, having one hundred times</p>
<p>he votes of Class B shares-would only need a few fairly simple</p>
<p>safeguards to be functional: First, vesting the Class A shares,
with</p>
<p>heir superior voting power, in a truly independent and strong board
of</p>
<p>directors rather than in management, a board on which independent</p>
<p>outside directors have a clear majority (which is what the
Germans</p>
<p>require, by the way). Second, making the extra voting strength of
the</p>
<p>Class A shares conditional on the company’s showing specified
results</p>
<p>and adequate performance. Thus a two-class system of shares would</p>
<p>control the hostile takeover and yet give protection against
managerial</p>
<p>malperformance and even against managerial mediocrity.</p>
<p>But perhaps the takeover wave will come to an end with a whimper</p>
<p>rather than a bang by losing its financial underpinnings. It would
not</p>
<p>ake much to bring this about. One default on one big loan to finance
a</p>
<p>hostile takeover, one “billion-dollar-scandal“ similar to the
Penn</p>
<p>Square collapse in Oklahoma that brought down Chicago’s mighty</p>
<p>Continental Illinois Bank-and there would be no more money avail-</p>
<p>able to finance hostile takeovers. And in the long history of
finance,</p>
<p>every single scheme that lured lenders into advancing money for</p>
<p>economically nonproductive purposes by promising them returns
sub-</p>
<p>stantially above the going market rate has come to a bad end sooner
or</p>
<p>later-and usually sooner.</p>
<p>Even if we control the hostile takeover, however, there will
remain</p>
<p>he underlying structural problems of which the hostile takeover is
only</p>
<p>The Hostile Takeover and Its Discontents 263</p>
<p>a symptom. It clearly raises basic questions about the following:
the</p>
<p>role, functions, and governance of pension funds; the legitimacy
of</p>
<p>management; and finally, the purpose of business enterprise,
espe-</p>
<p>cially large enterprise. Are the stockholders the only constituents
to</p>
<p>whom all other interests, including that of the enterprise itself as
a</p>
<p>going concern, must be totally subordinated?</p>
<p>Where Wall Street Meets Las Vegas</p>
<p>Abatement of the boom in hostile takeovers can, paradoxically,
only</p>
<p>aggravate the pension fund problem. It would eliminate the
windfall</p>
<p>profits pension funds now reap by accepting the inflated prices
the</p>
<p>raider offers. These windfall profits are, by and large, the only way
for</p>
<p>pension fund managers to obtain the quick stock-market gains that</p>
<p>heir bosses, the company’s managers, expect and demand of them.
If</p>
<p>hey are eliminated, company managers will predictably put even</p>
<p>greater pressure for quick results on the people who manage their</p>
<p>company’s pension fund; and those in turn will put even greater</p>
<p>pressure for short-term results on the companies in the shares of
which</p>
<p>he fund invests-thus pushing businesses even further toward
manag-</p>
<p>ing for the short term, which, as by now everybody agrees, is a</p>
<p>significant factor in the steady erosion of America’s competitive
posi-</p>
<p>ion in the world economy. As long as American pension funds are</p>
<p>based on “defined benefits,“ no relief is in sight.</p>
<p>It might have made sense for the labor unions to push for defined</p>
<p>benefits when pension funds first became widespread some thirty
years</p>
<p>ago. For under that system, the employer shoulders all future
risks.</p>
<p>Actually, in the negotiation of the contract that set the pattern
for</p>
<p>oday’s pension fund, the General Motors contract in the spring of</p>
<p>1950, the United Automobile Workers strongly opposed defined
bene-</p>
<p>fits and wanted “defined contributions“ instead.’ It was the
company</p>
<p>hat chose defined benefits, even though General Motors’ president
at</p>
<p>he time, Charles E. Wilson, recommended a defined-contributions</p>
<p>plan as financially much sounder. He as well as Reuther were,
how-</p>
<p>ever, overruled by GM’s finance committee, and the rest of the</p>
<p>country’s pension plans then followed GM’s lead. Yet the choice
of</p>
<p>defined benefits-as we now realize, a major blunder-was based on</p>
<p>he same delusion that makes people in Las Vegas believe they will</p>
<p>“make a fortune“ if only they keep on feeding more quarters into
the</p>
<p>slot machine.</p>
<p>Under defined benefits the company commits itself to paying the</p>
<p>future pensioner a fixed percentage of his wage or salary during
his</p>
<p>retirement years. The contribution the company makes is then
depen-</p>
<p>dent on the value of the fund’s assets in a given years, as against
the</p>
<p>present value of the future pension obligation. The higher the
fund’s</p>
<p>present value the lower the current contribution, and vice versa.
And</p>
<p>so management deluded itself into believing that an ever-rising
New</p>
<p>York stock market is a law of nature-r at least of history-and
that,</p>
<p>herefore, under a defined-benefits plan, it would be the stock
market,</p>
<p>hrough its preordained continuing rise, that would eventually
provide</p>
<p>he money to discharge the pension obligation rather than the
company</p>
<p>itself. Indeed, quite a few managements then promised their boards
of</p>
<p>directors that the defined-benefits plan would in the long run become
a</p>
<p>“money spinner“ for the company and would produce income well</p>
<p>above anything it would have to put into the plan.</p>
<p>And then the second delusion: Practically every company adopting
a</p>
<p>defined-benefits pension plan did so with the firm belief that its
own</p>
<p>pension plan, if only administered “professionally,“ would “beat“</p>
<p>even an ever-rising market.</p>
<p>There is, of course, no law that prescribes an ever-rising stock</p>
<p>market. Stock markets historically have not even been
particularly</p>
<p>effective as hedges against inflation: The American market in the
last</p>
<p>wenty years, for instance, barely kept pace with it. Indeed a large
pool</p>
<p>of money which over any long period of time grows at all, let alone
as</p>
<p>fast as the economy, is the rarest of all exceptions-neither the
Medici</p>
<p>nor the Fuggers, nor the Rothschilds nor the Morgans, succeeded
in</p>
<p>his endeavor. Similarly, no large-company pension fund, to the
best</p>
<p>of my knowledge, has over the last twenty or thirty years done as
well</p>
<p>as the stock market. The only performance that counts in the
pension</p>
<p>fund is performance over the long run, because the obligations
extend</p>
<p>over twenty-five years or longer. Indeed, some of the large
defined-</p>
<p>contributions funds have produced better results for their
beneficiaries,</p>
<p>he employees and future pensioners, and at lower cost to the
employ-</p>
<p>ers, than the great majority of the large defined-benefits plans.
This is</p>
<p>most definitely true of the largest of the defined-contributions
plans,</p>
<p>The Hostile Takeover and Its Discontents 265</p>
<p>hat of the employers and employees of the American nonprofit
institu-</p>
<p>ions, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.</p>
<p>The misconceptions that led American management into opting for</p>
<p>defined benefits thus practically guaranteed from the beginning that
the</p>
<p>funds would have to become “speculators“ and increasingly short</p>
<p>erm in their focus.</p>
<p>The choice of defined benefits also explains in large part the
poor</p>
<p>social performance of the American pension fund. For it was con-</p>
<p>ceived, as Walter Reuther quite rightly suspected, as much to be
a</p>
<p>social as to be a financial institution. It was conceived to create
a</p>
<p>visible center of common interest between employer and employee.</p>
<p>Indeed, what General Motors had in mind was very similar to what
the</p>
<p>Japanese, acting quite independently a few years later, achieved
by</p>
<p>“lifetime employment.“ But unlike lifetime employment the Ameri-</p>
<p>can pension fund has not created any community of interest in the</p>
<p>worker’s mind.</p>
<p>The laws that govern the private pension plans in America define</p>
<p>heir managers as “trustees“ for the eventual beneficiaries, the
em-</p>
<p>ployees. In reality the managers of defined-benefits plans are of
neces-</p>
<p>sity appointed by and accountable only to company management. For</p>
<p>he one at risk is the employer-and so the fund has to be run to</p>
<p>reduce, as much as possible, the burden on the employer. As a
result,</p>
<p>he employees feel no responsibility for the fund. It is “deferred</p>
<p>wages“ rather than a “stake in the company.“ The employees do not</p>
<p>feel that it makes any difference how the fund performs. And they
are</p>
<p>right: Unless the company goes bankrupt it does not make any
differ-</p>
<p>ence to them. They also, in a defined-benefits plan, cannot in
any</p>
<p>meaningful way be brought into the decision-making process
through</p>
<p>he pension fund, the actual owners of America’s productive re-</p>
<p>sources.</p>
<p>A defined-contributions plan is no panacea, but it minimizes the</p>
<p>problems. The right model was easily available thirty years
ago-for</p>
<p>he Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association goes back much</p>
<p>further, to the early 1920s. The TIAA runs on “flexible
contributions“</p>
<p>rather than on defined contributions. The contribution made each
year</p>
<p>into the plan by a university, or a nonprofit organization such as
the</p>
<p>Boy Scouts, or for a minister in a Protestant denomination, is a
fixed</p>
<p>percentage of salary. It goes up as the employee advances. It
thereby</p>
<p>also-an important point-automatically adjusts the annual
contribu-</p>
<p>ion to inflation. And yet this annual premium is known and
predict-</p>
<p>able. And because of this, the TIAA can, and does indeed, invest
for</p>
<p>he long term, which in turn explains why its results have been
better</p>
<p>han those of any of the large defined-benefits plans. At the same
time,</p>
<p>he TIAA, precisely because the employer has discharged his
obliga-</p>
<p>ion in full once he remits a fixed percentage of the employee’s
salary,</p>
<p>has been able to bring the future beneficiaries, that is, today’s
employ-</p>
<p>ees, into the government of the institution. University faculty do
not</p>
<p>consider the TIAA the “employer’s pension fund“; it is “our
pension</p>
<p>fund,“ in which they take an active interest and which to them</p>
<p>meaningfully symbolizes the basic identity of economic interest
be-</p>
<p>ween their employer, that is, the university, and themselves.</p>
<p>Pension plans are beginning to change, albeit very slowly. Many</p>
<p>companies, especially medium-size ones, now encourage employees</p>
<p>o make their own pension provisions, often out of
company-provided</p>
<p>funds, for example, through an Individual Retirement Account. That
at</p>
<p>least makes possible a rational (that is, a long-term) investment
policy.</p>
<p>But for the foreseeable future the bulk of our corporate pension
plans</p>
<p>will remain committed to the defined-benefits formula. The
principle</p>
<p>legal owners of our large companies, the large pension funds,
will</p>
<p>herefore continue to be forced to act as speculators rather than
as</p>
<p>investors, let alone as owners. And thus there will, for the
foresee-</p>
<p>able future, be a need to protect the economy’s wealth-producing</p>
<p>resources-that is, its businesses, and the pension funds
themselves-</p>
<p>against the pressure to manage for the immediate, the short term,
the</p>
<p>next month, the next quarter, and above all against the takeover.</p>
<p>Demise of the Corporate Guardians</p>
<p>Corporate capitalism-the rule of autonomous managers as the</p>
<p>“philosopher-kings’’ of the modern economy accountable at best</p>
<p>o a professional code but not controlled by shareholders or by
any</p>
<p>other constituency-was first proclaimed more than fifty years ago
by</p>
<p>Adolph Berle and Gardner Means in their 1932 classic, The Modern</p>
<p>Corporation and Private Property. “Control,“ Berle and Means ar-</p>
<p>gued, had become divorced from “property.“ Indeed, property was</p>
<p>The Hostile Takeover and Its Discontents 267</p>
<p>no longer ownership. It had become investment, concerned only
with</p>
<p>dividends and capital gains but not with the welfare or the
governance</p>
<p>of the property itself.</p>
<p>From the beginning, anyone with any knowledge of political theory</p>
<p>or political history could have predicted that this would not
work.</p>
<p>Management, one could confidently say, would not last any longer
as</p>
<p>philosopher-king than any earlier philosopher-kings had, which
was</p>
<p>never very long. Management has power. Indeed, to do its job, it
has</p>
<p>o have power. But power does not last, regardless of its
performance,</p>
<p>its knowledge, and its good intentions, unless it be grounded in
some</p>
<p>sanction outside and beyond itself, some “grounds of legitimacy,“</p>
<p>whether divine institution, or election, or the consent of the
governed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, power is not legitimate. It may be well-meaning, it
may</p>
<p>perform well, it may even test out as “highly popular“ in surveys
and</p>
<p>polls. Yet illegitimate power always succumbs to the first
challenger.</p>
<p>It may have no enemies, but no one believes in it, either, and no
one</p>
<p>owes it allegiance.</p>
<p>This should have been obvious to American management fifty years</p>
<p>ago when Berle and Means first pointed out that there was no more
real</p>
<p>ownership in the American corporation. After all, that the
philosopher-</p>
<p>king-that is, power grounded in performance rather than in
legiti-</p>
<p>macy-would not last had been known since Aristotle’s dismissal of</p>
<p>Plato’s philosopher-king, all of twenty-three hundred years ago.
But</p>
<p>American management did exactly what all earlier
philosopher-kings</p>
<p>have done-for example, the “enlightened despots“ of eighteenth-</p>
<p>century Europe. It gloried in its good intentions. And American
man-</p>
<p>agements busily engaged in removing what they considered as the
last</p>
<p>obstacle to their enlightened rule, an independent and powerful
board</p>
<p>of directors. And then, when the investors of Berle and Means
became</p>
<p>he speculators of the pension fund, management found itself
power-</p>
<p>less against the first challenger, the raider. The hostile takeover
bid is</p>
<p>hus the final failure of corporate capitalism.</p>
<p>But we do need management. The business enterprise needs a</p>
<p>government, and it needs a government that has power, has
continuity,</p>
<p>and can perform. In other words, it needs a government that has</p>
<p>legitimacy. How can legitimacy be restored to the management of</p>
<p>America’s large, publicly owned companies?</p>
<p>One step, surely the first one, is to restore an independent and
strong</p>
<p>board of directors. Indeed, as has already been pointed out, where
such</p>
<p>a board exists, raiders, by and large, have been beaten off. Even</p>
<p>shareholders whose only interest is the quick buck are likely to
listen to</p>
<p>a strong and independent board that- has standing and respect in
the</p>
<p>community and is not dismissed as management’s puppet. The
hostile</p>
<p>akeover may thus finally succeed in bringing about the reform and</p>
<p>restoration of the strong, independent board of directors which a
great</p>
<p>many voices within the business community have been demanding for</p>
<p>many years.</p>
<p>But such a board would not and could not be a representative of
the</p>
<p>shareholders alone. The board member who commands enough respect</p>
<p>o be listened to is likely to be an independent director, that is,
some-</p>
<p>body who does not represent any constituency, including the
nominal</p>
<p>owners, but rather the integrity and the interest of the enterprise
itself.</p>
<p>The hostile takeover is thus almost certain to speed up a
development</p>
<p>hat is already under way: the emergence of professionally
qualified</p>
<p>men and women who serve on a very small number of boards, maybe</p>
<p>no more than four at a time; who have independent respect and</p>
<p>standing in a broader community based on their achievements and</p>
<p>known integrity; and who take seriously their responsibilities,
includ-</p>
<p>ing the responsibility to set performance goals for top management
and</p>
<p>o police them, to monitor the behavior and ethics of top
management,</p>
<p>and to remove even the proudest chief executive officer who does
not</p>
<p>live up to the standards set by the board in the interest of the
enterprise.</p>
<p>But is this not simply replacing one set of philosopher-kings by</p>
<p>another group of technocrats or wise men? To be sure, independent</p>
<p>outside board members, unlike a company president, do not fight
for</p>
<p>heir own jobs when they resist a takeover. But they still do not</p>
<p>represent any identifiable constituency, neither do they have any</p>
<p>grounds of legitimacy other than disinterested performance and
knowl-</p>
<p>edge. Will the large public corporation in America have to learn
to</p>
<p>mobilize new constituents, to bring in other “interests“ to balance
the</p>
<p>former owners now become speculators, and to create new bonds of</p>
<p>allegiance?</p>
<p>Reportedly, would-be raiders refrain from making a hostile
takeover</p>
<p>bid for a company in which employees hold a substantial portion of
the</p>
<p>shares. They know that employee-owners are not likely to accept
the</p>
<p>raider’s offer. Most employees stand to lose more, of course, if
their</p>
<p>The Hostile Takeover and Its Discontents 269</p>
<p>jobs are endangered than they can possibly gain by getting more
for</p>
<p>heir stock. Above all employees identify with the company and are</p>
<p>personally and emotionally attached to its remaining independent.
And</p>
<p>he most spectacular defeat of a hostile takeover bid was not
achieved</p>
<p>by a management with a strong performance record. It was the
previ-</p>
<p>ously mentioned defeat of the bid for Phillips Petroleum in
Bartles-</p>
<p>ville, Oklahoma, when the town itself rallied to the defense of
its</p>
<p>major employer.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago it was popular in American big business to talk
of</p>
<p>management as being the “trustee for the best-balanced interests
of</p>
<p>stockholders, employees, plant community, customers, and
suppliers</p>
<p>alike.“ In many cases, of course, this was pure phrase meant to
clothe</p>
<p>with respectability the managerial philosopher-king and his
enlight-</p>
<p>ened despotism. But even where there was more to this assertion
than</p>
<p>self-interest, nothing has been done as a rule to convert the phrase
into</p>
<p>reality. Few attempts have been made to institutionalize the
relation-</p>
<p>ship of these supposed “constituencies“ to the enterprise and its
man-</p>
<p>agement. Will this now have to be undertaken in earnest to
safeguard</p>
<p>both enterprise and management? And what form should such
institu-</p>
<p>ional relationships take?</p>
<p>The Challenge to Free Enterprise</p>
<p>The question being most hotly debated currently is whether
hostile</p>
<p>akeovers are good or bad for shareholders. But what other groups
may</p>
<p>have a legitimate stake in the fight for the control and survival of
the</p>
<p>enterprise is probably more important, though less discussed. Does
the</p>
<p>modem, publicly owned, large enterprise exist exclusively for the
sake</p>
<p>of the shareholders? This is, of course, what orthodox
“capitalism“</p>
<p>asserts. But the term free enterprise was coined forty or fifty years
ago</p>
<p>o assert that the shareholder interest, although important, is only
one</p>
<p>interest and that the enterprise has functions well beyond that
of</p>
<p>producing returns for the shareholder-functions as an employer, as
a</p>
<p>citizen of the community, as a customer, and as a supplier. The</p>
<p>British, in establishing a “take-over panel,“ have expressly
recog-</p>
<p>nized that a decision on mergers and takeovers affects the public</p>
<p>interest. So far in the United States, this is expressed only
negatively,</p>
<p>hat is, in forbidding mergers that violate antitrust laws. Will we
have</p>
<p>o bring in considerations of the impact on other groups and on
the</p>
<p>community and economy as a whole-and in which form? That is the</p>
<p>central question. The answers this country will give to it will
largely</p>
<p>define the future shape of the American economy.</p>
<p>If the answer is, however, that the speculator’s interest-never
mind</p>
<p>hat the speculator has legal title as an owner-is the only interest
to be</p>
<p>considered, the free-enterprise system is unlikely to survive. It
will</p>
<p>rapidly lose public support. For most people, even though they do</p>
<p>benefit-however indirectly (that is, as ultimate beneficiaries in
a</p>
<p>pension fund)-from the speculator’s game, stand to lose more from</p>
<p>he hostile takeover as employees, whether blue-collar or
managers,</p>
<p>and as citizens of a community. And more and more people are</p>
<p>concerned with the hostile takeover as a moral issue. It deeply
offends</p>
<p>he sense of justice of a great many Americans.</p>
<p>Most Americans today are employees of an organization. There is a</p>
<p>good deal of evidence that people in an organization, and
especially</p>
<p>managerial and professional people, will accept even the most
painful</p>
<p>adjustment, such as the closing of a business or the sale of parts of
it, if</p>
<p>he rationale is economic performance of the lack thereof. But this
of</p>
<p>course is not the rationale for the purchase or sale of the human</p>
<p>organization or of its parts in the hostile takeover. There the
only</p>
<p>rationale is to enrich somebody who has nothing to do with the</p>
<p>performance of the enterprise and who, quite admittedly, has not
the</p>
<p>slightest interest in it. And this goes against the grain of
employees</p>
<p>who feel that the hostile takeover treats them as “chattel“ and not
as a</p>
<p>“resource,“ let alone as human beings. “Is the hostile takeover
even</p>
<p>compatible with our laws against peonage and involuntary
servitude?“</p>
<p>he middle-level executives in my advanced-management classes have</p>
<p>been asking me of late.</p>
<p>Almost a hundred years ago the United States decided that the
rights</p>
<p>of the creditor are not absolute and amended its bankruptcy laws to
put</p>
<p>maintenance and restoration of the “going concern“ ahead of the</p>
<p>rights of the creditor, which till then had ruled when a business got
into</p>
<p>difficulties. This has worked remarkably well. The protection of
the</p>
<p>going concern during reorganization has indeed proved to be in
the</p>
<p>ultimate interest of the creditor, too. Will we now do the same
thing</p>
<p>with respect to the hostile takeover and given consideration to
the</p>
<p>protection of the going concern as a resource, and to the interests
of</p>
<p>The Hostile Takeover and Its Discontents 271</p>
<p>employees, whether blue-collar, white-collar, or managerial; of
the</p>
<p>community; of suppliers and customers? Actually we are already</p>
<p>moving in this direction through extending the protection of the
bank-</p>
<p>ruptcy laws to nonbankrupt going concerns threatened by subjection
to</p>
<p>one single interest. The Johns-Manville Corporation-a leading
pro-</p>
<p>ducer of asbestos and other building materials-successfully
invoked</p>
<p>he bankruptcy laws to preserve itself as a going concern and to
protect</p>
<p>its shareholders and its employees against a tidal wave of
asbestos-</p>
<p>damage liability suits. Continental Airlines similarly used the
bank-</p>
<p>ruptcy laws successfully to preserve itself against union wage
claims</p>
<p>hat had become unbearable when deregulation made airfares and</p>
<p>airline routes hotly competitive. It is by no means inconceivable
that a</p>
<p>clever lawyer will similarly construe the bankruptcy laws to
preserve</p>
<p>he going concern against the hostile takeover-and that the courts
will</p>
<p>go along as they did in the Johns-Manville and Continental
Airlines</p>
<p>cases. But one way or another-by law, by moving to multitier
stock</p>
<p>ownership, or by judicial exegesis-we surely will find a way to</p>
<p>protect the going concern against hostile takeovers that subordinate
all</p>
<p>other interests+mployees, the enterprise’s long-range growth and</p>
<p>prosperity, and the country’s competitive position in an
increasingly</p>
<p>competitive world economy-to short-term speculative gain.</p>
