<h4 id="the-information-based-organization">The Information-Based
Organization</h4>
<p>The typical large business twenty years hence will have fewer
than</p>
<p>half the levels of management of its counterpart today, and no
more</p>
<p>han a third the managers. In its structure, and in its management</p>
<p>problems and concerns, it will bear little resemblance to the
typical</p>
<p>manufacturing company, circa 1950, which our textbooks still
consid-</p>
<p>er the norm. Instead it is far more likely to resemble organizations
that</p>
<p>neither the practicing manager nor the management scholar pays
much</p>
<p>attention to today: the hospital, the university, the symphony
orches-</p>
<p>ra. For like them, the typical business will be knowledge-based,
an</p>
<p>organization composed largely of specialists who direct and
discipline</p>
<p>heir own performance through organized feedback from colleagues,</p>
<p>customers, and headquarters. For this reason, it will be what I call
an</p>
<p>information-based organization.</p>
<p>Businesses, especially large ones, have little choice but to
become</p>
<p>information-based. Demographics, for one, demands the shift. The</p>
<p>center of gravity in employment is moving fast from manual and</p>
<p>clerical workers to knowledge workers who resist the command-and-</p>
<p>control model that business took from the military 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Economics also dictates change, especially the need for large
busi-</p>
<p>nesses to innovate and to be entrepreneurs. But above all,
information</p>
<p>echnology demands the shift.</p>
<p>Advanced data-processing technology isn’t necessary to create an</p>
<p>information-based organization, of course. As we shall see, the
British</p>
<p>First Published in Harvard Business Review, 1988.</p>
<p>built just such an organization in India when “information
technolo-</p>
<p>gy“ meant the quill pen, and barefoot runners were the “telecom-</p>
<p>munications“ systems. But as advanced technology becomes more and</p>
<p>more prevalent, we have to engage in analysis and diagnosis-that
is,</p>
<p>in “informationv–even more intensively or risk being swamped by</p>
<p>he data we generate.</p>
<p>So far most computer users still use the new technology only to
do</p>
<p>faster what they have always done before, crunch conventional
num-</p>
<p>bers. But as soon as a company takes the first tentative steps from
data</p>
<p>o information, its decision processes, management structure, and
even</p>
<p>he way its work gets done begin to be transformed. In fact, this
is</p>
<p>already happening, quite fast, in a number of companies
throughout</p>
<p>he world.</p>
<p>We can readily see the first step in this transformation process
when</p>
<p>we consider the impact of computer technology on
capital-investment</p>
<p>decisions. We have known for a long time that there is no one
right</p>
<p>way to analyze a proposed capital investment. To understand it we</p>
<p>need at least six analyses: the expected rate of return; the payout
period</p>
<p>and the investment’s expected productive life; the discounted
present</p>
<p>value of all returns through the productive lifetime of the
investment;</p>
<p>he risk in not making the investments or deferring it; the cost and
risk</p>
<p>in case of failure; and finally, the opportunity cost. Every
accounting</p>
<p>student is taught these concepts. But before the advent of
data-process-</p>
<p>ing capacity, the actual analyses would have taken man-years of</p>
<p>clerical toil to complete. Now anyone with a spreadsheet should
be</p>
<p>able to do them in a few hours.</p>
<p>The availability of this information transforms the
capital-invest-</p>
<p>ment analysis from opinion into diagnosis, that is, into the
rational</p>
<p>weighing of alternative assumptions. Then the information
transforms</p>
<p>he capital-investment decision from an opportunistic, financial
deci-</p>
<p>sion governed by the numbers into a business decision based on
the</p>
<p>probability of alternative strategic assumptions. So the decision
both</p>
<p>presupposes a business strategy and challenges that strategy and
its</p>
<p>assumptions. What was once a budget exercise becomes an analysis
of</p>
<p>policy.</p>
<p>The second area that is affected when a company focuses its data-</p>
<p>processing capacity on producing information is its organization
struc-</p>
<p>The Information-Based Organization 347</p>
<p>ure. Almost immediately, it becomes clear that both the number of</p>
<p>management levels and the number of managers can be sharply cut.</p>
<p>The reason is straightforward: it turns out that whole layers of
manage-</p>
<p>ment neither make decisions nor lead. Instead, their main, if not
their</p>
<p>only, function is to serve as “relaysM-human boosters for the
faint,</p>
<p>unfocused signals that pass for communication in the traditional
prein-</p>
<p>formation organization.</p>
<p>One of America’s largest defense contractors made this discovery</p>
<p>when it asked what information its top corporate and operating
manag-</p>
<p>ers needed to do their jobs. Where did it come from? What form was
it</p>
<p>in? How did it flow? The search for answers soon revealed that
whole</p>
<p>layers of management-perhaps as many as six out of a total of</p>
<p>fourteen-xisted only because these questions had not been asked</p>
<p>before. The company had had data galore. But it had always used
its</p>
<p>copious data for control rather than for information.</p>
<p>Information is data endowed with relevance and purpose. Convert-</p>
<p>ing data into information thus requires knowledge. And knowledge,
by</p>
<p>definition, is specialized. (In fact, truly knowledgeable people
tend</p>
<p>oward overspecialization, whatever their field, precisely because</p>
<p>here is always so much more to know.)</p>
<p>The information-based organization requires far more specialists</p>
<p>overall than the command-and-control companies we are accustomed</p>
<ol start="15" type="a">
<li>Moreover, the specialists are found in operations, not at
corporate</li>
</ol>
<p>headquarters. Indeed, the operating organization tends to become
an</p>
<p>organization of specialists of all kinds.</p>
<p>Information-based organizations need central operating work such</p>
<p>as legal counsel, public relations, and labor relations as much as
ever.</p>
<p>But the need for service staffs-that is, for people without
operating</p>
<p>responsibilities who only advise, counsel, or coordinate-shrinks
dras-</p>
<p>ically. In its central management, the information-based
organization</p>
<p>needs few, if any, specialists.</p>
<p>Because of its flatter structure, the large, information-based
organi-</p>
<p>zation will more closely resemble the businesses of a century ago
than</p>
<p>oday’s big companies. Back then, however, all the knowledge, such</p>
<p>as it was, lay with the very top people. The rest were helpers or
hands,</p>
<p>who mostly did the same work and did as they were told. In the</p>
<p>information-based organization, the knowledge will be primarily at
the</p>
<p>bottom, in the minds of the specialists who do different work and</p>
<p>direct themselves. So today’s typical organization in which
knowledge</p>
<p>ends to be concentrated in service staffs, perched rather
insecurely</p>
<p>between top management and the operating people, will likely be</p>
<p>labeled a phase, an attempt to infuse knowledge from the top
rather</p>
<p>han obtain information from below.</p>
<p>Finally, a good deal of work will be done differently in the</p>
<p>information-based organization. Traditional departments will serve
as</p>
<p>guardians of standards, as centers for training and the assignment
of</p>
<p>specialists; they won’t be where the work gets done. That will
happen</p>
<p>largely in task-focused teams.</p>
<p>This change is already under way in what used to be the most
clearly</p>
<p>defined of all departments-research. In pharmaceuticals, in
telecom-</p>
<p>munications, in papermaking, the traditional sequence of
research,</p>
<p>development, manufacturing, and marketing is being replaced by
syn-</p>
<p>chrony: specialists from all these functions work together as a
team,</p>
<p>from the inception of research to a product’s establishment in
the</p>
<p>market.</p>
<p>How task forces will develop to tackle other business
opportunities</p>
<p>and problems remains to be seen. I suspect, however, that the need
for</p>
<p>a task force, its assignment, its composition, and its leadership
will</p>
<p>have to be decided on case by case. So the organization that will
be</p>
<p>developed will go beyond the matrix and may indeed be quite
different</p>
<p>from it. One thing is clear, though: it will require greater
self-</p>
<p>discipline and even greater emphasis on individual responsibility
for</p>
<p>relationships and for communications.</p>
<p>To say that information technology is transforming business
enter-</p>
<p>prises is simple. What this transformation will require of
companies</p>
<p>and top managements is much harder to decipher. That is why I find
it</p>
<p>helpful to look for clues in other kinds of information-based
organiza-</p>
<p>ions, such as the hospital, the symphony orchestra, and the
British</p>
<p>administration in India.</p>
<p>A fair-sized hospital of about 400 beds will have a staff of
several</p>
<p>hundred physicians and 1,200 to 1,500 paramedics divided among</p>
<p>some 60 medical and paramedical specialities. Each specialty has
its</p>
<p>own knowledge, its own training, its own language. In each
specialty,</p>
<p>especially the paramedical ones like the clinical lab and
physical</p>
<p>herapy, there is a head person who is a working specialist rather
than a</p>
<p>The Information-Based Organization 349</p>
<p>full-time manager. The head of each specialty reports directly to
the</p>
<p>op, and there is little middle management. A good deal of the work
is</p>
<p>done in ad hoc teams as required by an individual patient’s
diagnosis</p>
<p>and condition.</p>
<p>A large symphony orchestra is even more instructive, since for
some</p>
<p>works there may be a few hundred musicians on stage playing
togeth-</p>
<p>er. According to organization theory then, there should be
several</p>
<p>group vice president conductors and perhaps a half-dozen division
VP</p>
<p>conductors. But that’s not how it works. There is only the
conductor-</p>
<p>CEO-and every one of the musicians plays directly to that person</p>
<p>without an intermediary. And each is a high-grade specialist, indeed
an</p>
<p>artist.</p>
<p>But the best example of a large and successful information-based</p>
<p>organization, and one without any middle management at all, is
the</p>
<p>British civil administration in India.’</p>
<p>The British ran the Indian subcontinent for 200 years, from the
mid-</p>
<p>dle of the eighteenth century through World War 11, without
making</p>
<p>any fundamental changes in organization structure or
administrative</p>
<p>policy. The Indian civil service never had more than 1,000 members
to</p>
<p>administer the vast and densely populated subcontinent-a tiny
frac-</p>
<p>ion (at most 1 percent) of the legions of Confucian mandarins and</p>
<p>palace eunuchs employed next door to administer a not-much-more</p>
<p>populous China. Most of the Britishers were quite young; a
thirty-year-</p>
<p>old was a survivor, especially in the early years. Most lived alone
in</p>
<p>isolated outposts with the nearest countryman a day or two of
travel</p>
<p>away, and for the first hundred years there was no telegraph or</p>
<p>railroad.</p>
<p>The organization structure was totally flat. Each distinct
officer</p>
<p>reported directly to the “COO,“ the provincial political
secretary.</p>
<p>And since there were nine provinces, each political secretary had
at</p>
<p>least 100 people reporting directly to him, many times what the</p>
<p>doctrine of the span of control would allow. Nevertheless, the
system</p>
<p>worked remarkably well, in large part because it was designed to</p>
<p>ensure that each of its members had the information he needed to
do</p>
<p>his job.</p>
<p>Each month the district officer spent a whole day writing a full
re-</p>
<p>port to the political secretary in the provincial capital. He
discussed</p>
<p>each of his principal tasks-there were only four, each clearly
delin-</p>
<p>eated. He put down in detail what he had expected would happen
with</p>
<p>respect to each of them, what actually did happen, and why, if
there</p>
<p>was a discrepancy, the two differed. Then he wrote down what he</p>
<p>expected would happen in the ensuing month with respect to each
key</p>
<p>ask and what he was going to do about it, asked questions about</p>
<p>policy, and commented on long-term opportunities, threats, and
needs.</p>
<p>In turn, the political secretary “minuted“ every one of those
reports-</p>
<p>hat is, he wrote back a full comment.</p>
<p>On the basis of these examples, what can we say about the
require-</p>
<p>ments of the information-based organization? And what are its
man-</p>
<p>agement problems likely to be? Let’s look first at the
requirements.</p>
<p>Several hundred musicians and their CEO, the conductor, can play</p>
<p>ogether because they all have the same score. It tells both flutist
and</p>
<p>impanist what to play and when. And it tells the conductor what
to</p>
<p>expect from each and when. Similarly, all the specialists in the
hospital</p>
<p>share a common mission: the care and cure of the sick. The
diagnosis</p>
<p>is their “score“; it dictates specific action for the X-ray lab,
the</p>
<p>dietitian, the physical therapist, and the rest of the medical
team.</p>
<p>Information-based organizations, in other words, require clear,
sim-</p>
<p>ple, common objectives that translate into particular actions. At
the</p>
<p>same time, however, as these examples indicate, information-based</p>
<p>organizations also need concentration on one objective or, at most,
on</p>
<p>a few.</p>
<p>Because the “players“ in an information-based organization are</p>
<p>specialists, they cannot be told how to do their work. There are</p>
<p>probably few orchestra conductors who could coax even one note
out</p>
<p>of a French horn, let alone show the horn player how to do it. But
the</p>
<p>conductor can focus the horn player’s skill and knowledge on the</p>
<p>musician’s joint performance. And this focus is what the leaders of
an</p>
<p>information-based business must be able to achieve.</p>
<p>Yet a business has no “score“ to play by except the score it
writes</p>
<p>as it plays. And whereas neither a first-rate performance of a
sympho-</p>
<p>ny nor a miserable one will change what the composer wrote, the</p>
<p>performance of a business continually creates new and different
scores</p>
<p>against which its performance is assessed. So an
information-based</p>
<p>business must be structured around goals that clearly state
manage-</p>
<p>ment’s performance expectations for the enterprise and for each
part</p>
<p>The Information-Based Organization 351</p>
<p>and specialist and around organized feedback that compares
results</p>
<p>with these performance expectations so that every member can
exer-</p>
<p>cise self-control.</p>
<p>The other requirement of an information-based organization is
that</p>
<p>everyone take information responsibility. The bassoonist in the
orches-</p>
<p>ra does so every time she plays a note. Doctors and paramedics
work</p>
<p>with an elaborate system of reports and an information center,
the</p>
<p>nurse’s station on the patient’s floor. The district officer in India
acted</p>
<p>on this responsibility every time he filed a report.</p>
<p>The key to such a system is that everyone asks: Who in this</p>
<p>organization depends on me for what information? And on whom, in</p>
<p>urn, do I depend? Each person’s list will always include superiors
and</p>
<p>subordinates. But the most important names on it will be those of
col-</p>
<p>leagues, people with whom one’s primary relationship is
coordination.</p>
<p>The relationship of the internist, the surgeon, and the
anesthesiologist</p>
<p>is one example. But the relationship of a biochemist, a
pharmacolo-</p>
<p>gist, the medical director in charge of clinical testing, and a
marketing</p>
<p>specialist in a pharmaceutical company is no different. It, too,
requires</p>
<p>each party to take the fullest information responsibility.</p>
<p>Information responsibility to others is increasingly understood,
es-</p>
<p>pecially in middle-sized companies. But information responsibility
to</p>
<p>oneself is still largely neglected. That is, everyone in an
organization</p>
<p>should constantly be thinking through what information he or she</p>
<p>needs to do the job and to make a contribution.</p>
<p>This may well be the most radical break with the way even the
most</p>
<p>highly computerized businesses are still being run today. There,
peo-</p>
<p>ple either assume the more data, the more information-which was a</p>
<p>perfectly valid assumption yesterday when data were scarce, but
leads</p>
<p>o data overload and information blackout now that they are
plentiful.</p>
<p>Or they believe that information specialists know what data
executives</p>
<p>and professionals need in order to have information. But
information</p>
<p>specialists are tool makers. They can tell us what tool to use to
hammer</p>
<p>upholstery nails into a chair. We need to decide whether we should
be</p>
<p>upholstering a chair at all.</p>
<p>Executives and professional specialists need to think through
what</p>
<p>information is for them, what data they need: first, to know what
they</p>
<p>are doing; then, to be able to decide what they should be doing;
and</p>
<p>finally, to appraise how well they are doing. Until this happens
MIS</p>
<p>departments are likely to remain cost centers rather than become
the</p>
<p>result centers they could be.</p>
<p>Most large businesses have little in common with the examples we</p>
<p>have been looking at. Yet to remain competitive-maybe even to</p>
<p>survive-they will have to convert themselves into
information-based</p>
<p>organizations, and fairly quickly. They will have to change old
habits</p>
<p>and acquire new ones. And the more successful a company has been,</p>
<p>he more difficult and painful this process is apt to be. It will
threaten</p>
<p>he jobs, status, and opportunities of a good many people in the</p>
<p>organization, especially the long-serving, middle-aged people in
mid-</p>
<p>dle management who tend to be the least mobile and to feel most</p>
<p>secure in their work, their positions, their relationships, and
their</p>
<p>behavior.</p>
<p>The information-based organization will also pose its own special</p>
<p>management problems. I see as particularly critical:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Developing rewards, recognition, and career opportunities for
specialists.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating unified vision in an organization of
specialists.</p></li>
<li><p>Devising the management structure for an organization of task
forces.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring the supply, preparation, and testing of top management
people.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Bassoonists presumably neither want nor expect to be anything but</p>
<p>bassoonists. Their career opportunities consist of moving from
second</p>
<p>bassoon to first bassoon and perhaps of moving from a second-rank</p>
<p>orchestra to a better, more prestigious one. Similarly, many
medical</p>
<p>echnologists neither expect nor want to be anything but medical</p>
<p>echnologists. Their career opportunities consist of a fairly good</p>
<p>chance of moving up to senior technician, and a very slim chance
of</p>
<p>becoming lab director. For those who make it to lab director, about
one</p>
<p>out of every twenty-five or thirty technicians, there is also the
oppor-</p>
<p>unity to move to a bigger, richer hospital. The district officer in
India</p>
<p>had practically no chance for professional growth except possibly to
be</p>
<p>relocated, after a three-year stint, to a bigger district.</p>
<p>Opportunities for specialists in an information-based business
orga-</p>
<p>nization should be more plentiful than they are in an orchestra
or</p>
<p>hospital, let alone in the Indian civil service. But as in these
organiza-</p>
<p>ions, they will primarily be opportunities for advancement within
the</p>
<p>The Information-Based Organization 353</p>
<p>specialty, and for limited advancement at that. Advancement into</p>
<p>“management“ will be the exception, for the simple reason that
there</p>
<p>will be far fewer middle-management positions to move into. This</p>
<p>contrasts sharply with the traditional organization where, except in
the</p>
<p>research lab, the main line of advancement in rank is out of the</p>
<p>specialty and into general management.</p>
<p>More than thirty years ago General Electric tackled this problem
by</p>
<p>creating “parallel opportunities“ for “individual professional
contrib-</p>
<p>utors.’’ Many companies have followed this example. But
professional</p>
<p>specialists themselves have largely rejected it as a solution. To
them-</p>
<p>and to their management colleagues-the only meaningful oppor-</p>
<p>unities are promotions into management. And the prevailing
compen-</p>
<p>sation structure in practically all businesses reinforces this
attitude</p>
<p>because it is heavily biased towards managerial positions and
titles.</p>
<p>There are no easy answers to this problem. Some help may come</p>
<p>from looking at large law and consulting firms, where even the
most</p>
<p>senior partners tend to be specialists, and associates who will not
make</p>
<p>partner are outplaced fairly early on. But whatever scheme is
eventu-</p>
<p>ally developed will work only if the values and compensation
structure</p>
<p>of business are drastically changed.</p>
<p>The second challenge that management faces is giving its
organiza-</p>
<p>ion of specialists a common vision, a view of the whole.</p>
<p>In the Indian civil service, the district officer was expected to see
the</p>
<p>“whole“ of his district. But to enable him to concentrate on it,
the</p>
<p>government services that arose one after the other in the
nineteenth</p>
<p>century (forestry, irrigation, the archaeological survey, public
health</p>
<p>and sanitation, roads) were organized outside the administrative
struc-</p>
<p>ure, and had virtually no contact with the district officer. This
meant</p>
<p>hat the district officer became increasingly isolated from the
activities</p>
<p>hat often had the greatest impact on-and the greatest importance</p>
<p>for-his district. In the end, only the provincial government or
the</p>
<p>central government in Delhi had a view of the “whole,“ and it was
an</p>
<p>increasingly abstract one at that.</p>
<p>A business simply cannot function this way. It needs a view of
the</p>
<p>whole and a focus on the whole to be shared among a great many of
its</p>
<p>professional specialists, certainly among the senior ones. And yet
it</p>
<p>will have to accept, indeed will have to foster, the pride and
profes-</p>
<p>sionalism of its specialists-if only because, in the absence of
oppor-</p>
<p>unities to move into middle management, their motivation must
come</p>
<p>from that pride and professionalism.</p>
<p>One way to foster professionalism, of course, is through assign-</p>
<p>ments to task forces. And the information-based business will use</p>
<p>more and more smaller self-governing units, assigning them tasks
tidy</p>
<p>enough for “a good man to get his arms around,“ as the old phrase
has</p>
<p>it. But to what extent should information-based businesses rotate
per-</p>
<p>forming specialists out of their specialties and into new ones? And
to</p>
<p>what extent will top management have to accept as its top
priority</p>
<p>making and maintaining a common vision across professional spe-</p>
<p>cialties?</p>
<p>Heavy reliance on task-force teams assuages one problem. But it</p>
<p>aggravates another: the management structure of the
information-based</p>
<p>organization. Who will the business’s managers be? Will they be
task-</p>
<p>force leaders? Or will there be a two-headed monster-a specialist</p>
<p>structure, comparable, perhaps, to the way attending physicians
func-</p>
<p>ion in a hospital, and an administrative structure of task-force
leaders?</p>
<p>The decisions we face on the role and function of the task-force</p>
<p>leaders are risky and controversial. Is theirs a permanent
assignment,</p>
<p>analagous to the job of the supervisory nurse in the hospital? Or is
it a</p>
<p>function of the task that changes as the task does? Is it an
assignment or</p>
<p>a position? Does it carry any rank at all? And if it does, will the
task-</p>
<p>force leaders become in time what the product managers have been
at</p>
<p>Procter andandandand Gamble: the basic units of management and the
company’s</p>
<p>field officers? Might the task-force leaders eventually replace
depart-</p>
<p>ment heads and vice presidents?</p>
<p>Signs of every one of these developments exist, but there is neither
a</p>
<p>clear trend nor much understanding as to what each entails. Yet
each</p>
<p>would give rise to a different organizational structure from any we
are</p>
<p>familiar with.</p>
<p>Finally, the toughest problem will probably be to ensure the
supply,</p>
<p>preparation, and testing of top management people. This is, of
course,</p>
<p>an old and central dilemma as well as a major reason for the
general</p>
<p>acceptance of decentralization in large businesses in the last
forty</p>
<p>years. But the existing business organization has a great many
middle-</p>
<p>management positions that are supposed to prepare and test a
person.</p>
<p>As a result, there are usually a good many people to choose from
when</p>
<p>filling a senior management slot. With the number of
middle-manage-</p>
<p>The Information-Based Organization 355</p>
<p>ment positions sharply cut, where will the information-based
organiza-</p>
<p>ion’s top executives come from? What will be their preparation?
How</p>
<p>will they have been tested?</p>
<p>Decentralization into autonomous units will surely be even more</p>
<p>critical than it is now. Perhaps we will even copy the German
Gruppe</p>
<p>in which the decentralized units are set up as separate companies
with</p>
<p>heir own top managements. The Germans use this model precisely</p>
<p>because of their tradition of promoting people in their
specialties,</p>
<p>especially in research and engineering; if they did not have
available</p>
<p>commands in near-independent subsidiaries to put people in, they</p>
<p>would have little opportunity to train and test their most
promising</p>
<p>professionals. These subsidiaries are thus somewhat like the farm</p>
<p>eams of a major-league baseball club.</p>
<p>We may also find that more and more top management jobs in big</p>
<p>companies are filled by hiring people away from smaller
companies.</p>
<p>This is the way that major orchestras get their conductors-a
young</p>
<p>conductor earns his or her spurs in a small orchestra or opera
house,</p>
<p>only to be hired away by a larger one. And the heads of a good
many</p>
<p>large hospitals have had similar careers.</p>
<p>Can business follow the example of the orchestra and hospital
where</p>
<p>op management has become a separate career? Conductors and hospi-</p>
<p>al administrators come out of courses in conducting or schools of</p>
<p>hospital administration respectively. We see something of this sort
in</p>
<p>France, where large companies are often run by men who have spent</p>
<p>heir entire previous careers in government service. But in most
coun-</p>
<p>ries this would be unacceptable to the organization (only France
has</p>
<p>he mystique of the grandes e’coles). And even in France,
businesses,</p>
<p>especially large ones, are becoming too demanding to be run by
people</p>
<p>without firsthand experience and a proven success record.</p>
<p>Thus the entire top management process-preparation, testing, suc-</p>
<p>cession-will become even more problematic than it already is.
There</p>
<p>will be a growing need for experienced businesspeople to go back
to</p>
<p>school. And business schools will surely need to work out what</p>
<p>successful professional specialists must know to prepare
themselves</p>
<p>for high-level positions as business executives and business
leaders.</p>
<p>Since modem business enterprise first arose, after the Civil War
in</p>
<p>he United States and the Franco-Prussian War in Europe, there
have</p>
<p>been two major evolutions in the concept and structure of
organiza-</p>
<p>ions. The first took place in the ten years between 1895 and 1905.
It</p>
<p>distinguished management from ownership and established manage-</p>
<p>ment as work and task in its own right. This happened first in
Ger-</p>
<p>many, when Georg Siemens, the founder and head of Germany’s</p>
<p>premier bank, Deutsche Bank, saved the electrical apparatus
company</p>
<p>his cousin Werner Siemens had founded after Werner’s sons and
heirs</p>
<p>had mismanaged it into near collapse. By threatening to cut off
the</p>
<p>bank’s loans, he forced his cousins to turn the company’s
management</p>
<p>over to professionals. A little later, J. P. Morgan, Andrew
Carnegie,</p>
<p>and John D. Rockefeller, Sr. followed suit in their massive
restructur-</p>
<p>i n g ~of U.S. railroads and industries.</p>
<p>The second evolutionary change took place twenty years later. The</p>
<p>development of what we still see as the modern corporation began
with</p>
<p>Pierre S. du Pont’s restructuring of his family company in the
early</p>
<p>wenties and continued with Alfred P. Sloan’s redesign of General</p>
<p>Motors a few years later. This introduced the command-and-control</p>
<p>organization of today, with its emphasis on decentralization,
central</p>
<p>service staffs, personnel management, the whole apparatus of
budgets</p>
<p>and controls, and the important distinction between policy and
opera-</p>
<p>ions. This stage culminated in the massive reorganization of
General</p>
<p>Electric in the early 1950s, an action that perfected the model most
big</p>
<p>businesses around the world (including Japanese organizations)
still</p>
<p>follow.*</p>
<p>Now we are entering a third period of change: the shift from the</p>
<p>command-and-control organization, the organization of departments</p>
<p>and divisions, to the information-based organization, the
organization</p>
<p>of knowledge specialists. We can perceive, though perhaps only
dim-</p>
<p>ly, what this organization will look like. We can identify some of
its</p>
<p>main characteristics and requirements. We can point to central
prob-</p>
<p>lems of values, structure, and behavior. But the job of actually
build-</p>
<p>ing the information-based organization is still ahead of us-it is
the</p>
<p>managerial challenge of the future.</p>
