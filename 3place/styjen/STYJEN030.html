<h4 id="information-communicationsand-understanding">Information,
Communications,and Understanding</h4>
<p>Concern with “information“ and “communications“ started short-</p>
<p>ly before World War I. Russell and Whitehead’s Principia Mathe-</p>
<p>matica, which appeared in 1910, is still one of the foundation
books.</p>
<p>And a long line of illustrious successors-from Ludwig
Wittgenstein</p>
<p>hrough Norbert Wiener and A. N. Chomsky’s “mathematical linguis-</p>
<p>ics“ today-has continued the work on the logic of information.</p>
<p>Roughly contemporaneous is the interest in the meaning of
communi-</p>
<p>cation; Alfred Korzybski started on the study of “general
semantics,“</p>
<p>hat is, on the meaning of communications, around the turn of the</p>
<p>century. It was World War I, however, which made the entire
Western</p>
<p>world communications-conscious. When the diplomatic documents of</p>
<p>1914 in the German and Russian archives were published, soon
after</p>
<p>he end of the fighting, it became appallingly clear that the
catastrophe</p>
<p>had been caused, in large measure, by communications failure
despite</p>
<p>copious and reliable information. And the war itself-+specially
the</p>
<p>otal failure of its one and only strategic concept, Winston
Churchill’s</p>
<p>Gallipoli campaign in 1915-1 andandandandwas patently a tragicomedy
of non-</p>
<p>communications. At the same time, the period immediately
following</p>
<p>World War I-a period of industrial strife and of total
noncommunica-</p>
<p>ion between Westerners and “revolutionary“ communists (and a
little</p>
<p>later, equally revolutionary fascists)-showed both the need for,
and</p>
<p>Paper read before the Fellows of the International Academy of
Management, Tokyo,</p>
<p>Japan, 1969.</p>
<p>he lack of, a valid theory or a functioning practice of
communications,</p>
<p>inside existing institutions, inside existing societies, and between
vari-</p>
<p>ous leadership groups and their various “publics. “</p>
<p>As a result, communications suddenly became, forty to fifty years</p>
<p>ago, a consuming interest of scholars as well as of practitioners.
Above</p>
<p>all, communications in management has this last half-century been
a</p>
<p>central concern to students and practitioners in all
institutions-</p>
<p>business, the military, public administration, hospital
administration,</p>
<p>university administration, and research administration. In no other
area</p>
<p>have intelligent men and women worked harder or with greater
dedica-</p>
<p>ion than psychologists, human relations experts, managers, and
man-</p>
<p>agement students have worked on improving communications in our</p>
<p>major institutions.</p>
<p>We have more attempts at communications today, that is, more</p>
<p>attempts to talk to others, and a surfeit of communications media,
un-</p>
<p>imaginable to the men who, around the time of World War I, started
to</p>
<p>work on the problems of communicating. The trickle of books on</p>
<p>communications has become a raging torrent. I recently received a</p>
<p>bibliography prepared for a graduate seminar on communications;
it</p>
<p>ran to ninety-seven pages. A recent anthology (The Human
Dialogue,</p>
<p>edited by Floyd W. Matson and Ashley Montagu; London: Collier-</p>
<p>Macmillan, 1967) contains articles by forty-nine different
contribu-</p>
<p>ors.</p>
<p>Yet communications has proven as elusive as the unicorn. Each of</p>
<p>he forty-nine contributors to The Human Dialogue has a theory of</p>
<p>communications which is incompatible with all the others. The
noise</p>
<p>level has gone up so fast that no one can really listen any more to
all</p>
<p>hat babble about communications. But there is clearly less and
less</p>
<p>communicating. The communications gap within institutions and be-</p>
<p>ween groups in society has been widening steadily-to the point</p>
<p>where it threatens to become an unbridgeable gulf of total
misunder-</p>
<p>standing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is an information explosion. Every profes-</p>
<p>sional and every executive-in fact, everyone except the
deaf-mute-</p>
<p>suddenly has access to data in inexhaustible abundance. All of us</p>
<p>feel-and overeat-very much like the little boy who has been left</p>
<p>alone in the candy store. But what has to be done to make this</p>
<p>cornucopia of data redound to information, let alone to
knowledge?</p>
<p>Information, Communications, and Understanding 321</p>
<p>We get a great many answers. But the one thing clear so far is that
no</p>
<p>one really has an answer. Despite “information theory“ and “data</p>
<p>processing“, no one yet has actually seen, let alone used, an
“infor-</p>
<p>mation system“, or a “data base“. The one thing we do know,</p>
<p>hough, is that the abundance of information changes the
communica-</p>
<p>ions problem and makes it both more urgent and even less
tractable.</p>
<p>There is a tendency today to give up on communications. In psy-</p>
<p>chology, for instance, the fashion today is the T-group with its
“sensi-</p>
<p>ivity training“. The avowed aim is not communications, but self-</p>
<p>awareness. T-groups focus on the “I“ and not on the “thou“. Ten
or</p>
<p>wenty years ago the rhetoric stressed “empathy“; now it stresses</p>
<p>“doing one’s thing“. However needed self-knowledge may be, com-</p>
<p>munication is needed at least as much (if, indeed, self-knowledge
is</p>
<p>possible without action on others, that is, without
communications).</p>
<p>Whether the T-groups are sound psychology and effective psycho-</p>
<p>herapy is well beyond my competence and the scope of this paper.
But</p>
<p>heir popularity attests to the failure of our attempts at
communica-</p>
<p>ions.</p>
<p>Despite the sorry state of communications in theory and practice,
we</p>
<p>have, however, learned a good deal about information and communi-</p>
<p>cations. Most of it, though, has not come out of the work on
communi-</p>
<p>cations to which we have devoted so much time and energy. It has</p>
<p>been the byproduct of work in a large number of seemingly
unrelated</p>
<p>fields, from learning theory to genetics and electronic engineering.
We</p>
<p>equally have a lot of experience-though mostly of failure-in a
good</p>
<p>many practical situations in all kinds of institutions.
Communications</p>
<p>we may, indeed, never understand. But communications in organiza-</p>
<p>ions-call it managerial communications-we do know something</p>
<p>about by now. It is a much narrower topic than communications per</p>
<p>se-but it is the topic to which this paper shall address itself.</p>
<p>We are, to be sure, still far away from mastery of
communications,</p>
<p>even in organizations. What knowledge we have about communica-</p>
<p>ions is scattered and, as a rule, not accessible, let alone in
applicable</p>
<p>form. But at least we increasingly know what does not work and,</p>
<p>sometimes, why it does not work. Indeed, we can say bluntly that
most</p>
<p>of today’s brave attempts at communication in
organization-whether</p>
<p>business, labor unions, government agencies, or universities-are</p>
<p>based on assumptions that have been proven to be invalid-and
that,</p>
<p>herefore, these efforts cannot have results. And perhaps we can
even</p>
<p>anticipate what might work.</p>
<p>What We Have Learned</p>
<p>We have learned, mostly through doing the wrong things, the fol-</p>
<p>lowing four fundamentals of communications:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Communication is perception,</p></li>
<li><p>Communication is expectations,</p></li>
<li><p>Communication is involvement,</p></li>
<li><p>Communication and information are totally different. But
information</p></li>
</ol>
<p>presupposes functioning communications.</p>
<p>Communication is Perception</p>
<p>An old riddle asked by the mystics of many religions-the Zen</p>
<p>Buddhists, the Sufis of Islam, or the rabbis of the Talmud-asks:
“Is</p>
<p>here a sound in the forest if a tree crashes down and no one is
around</p>
<p>o hear it?“ We now know that the right answer to this is “no“.
There</p>
<p>are sound waves. But there is no sound unless someone perceives
it.</p>
<p>Sound is created by perception. Sound is communication.</p>
<p>This may seem trite; after all, the mystics of old already knew
this,</p>
<p>for they, too, always answered that there is no sound unless
someone</p>
<p>can hear it. Yet the implications of this rather trite statement are
great</p>
<p>indeed.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>First, it means that it is the recipient who communicates. The
so-</li>
</ol>
<p>called communicator, that is, the person who emits the communica-</p>
<p>ion, does not communicate. He utters. Unless there is someone who</p>
<p>hears, there is no communication. There is only noise. The
communi-</p>
<p>cator speaks or writes or sings-but he does not communicate.
Indeed</p>
<p>he cannot communicate. He can only make it possible, or
impossible,</p>
<p>for a recipient-r rather percipient-to perceive.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Perception, we know, is not logic. It is experience. This
means,</li>
</ol>
<p>in the first place, that one always perceives a configuration.
One</p>
<p>cannot perceive single specifics. They are always part of a total</p>
<p>picture. The Silent Language (as Edward T . Hall called it in the
title of</p>
<p>his pioneering work ten years ago)-that is, the gestures, the tone
of</p>
<p>Information, Communications, and Understanding 323</p>
<p>voice, the environment all together, not to mention the cultural
and</p>
<p>social referents4annot be dissociated from the spoken language.
In</p>
<p>fact, without them the spoken word has no meaning and cannot</p>
<p>communicate. It is not only that the same words, for example, “I</p>
<p>enjoyed meeting you“, will be heard as having a wide variety of</p>
<p>meanings. Whether they are heard as warm or as icy cold, as
endear-</p>
<p>ment or as rejection, depends on their setting in the silent
language,</p>
<p>such as the tone of voice or the occasion. More important is that
by</p>
<p>hemselves, that is, without being part of the total configuration
of</p>
<p>occasion, silent language, and so on, the phrase has no meaning at
all.</p>
<p>By itself it cannot make possible communication. It cannot be
under-</p>
<p>stood. Indeed, it cannot be heard. To paraphrase an old proverb of
the</p>
<p>Human Relations school: “One cannot communicate a word; the</p>
<p>whole man always comes with it.“</p>
<p>c . But we know about perception also that one can only perceive</p>
<p>what one is capable of perceiving. Just as the human ear does not
hear</p>
<p>sounds above a certain pitch, so does human perception all together
not</p>
<p>perceive what is beyond its range of perception. It may, of course,
hear</p>
<p>physically, or see visually, but it cannot accept. The stimulus
cannot</p>
<p>become communication.</p>
<p>This is a very fancy way of stating something the teachers of
rhetoric</p>
<p>have known for a very long time-though the practitioners of
commu-</p>
<p>nications tend to forget it again and again. In Plato’s Phaedrus,
which,</p>
<p>among other things, is also the earliest extant treatise on
rhetoric,</p>
<p>Socrates points out that one has to talk to people in terms of their
own</p>
<p>experience, that is, that one has to use a carpenter’s metaphors
when</p>
<p>alking to carpenters, and so on. One can only communicate in the</p>
<p>recipient’s language or altogether in his terms. And the terms have
to</p>
<p>be experience-based. It, therefore, does very little good to try
to</p>
<p>explain terms to people. They will not be able to receive them if
the</p>
<p>erms are not of their own experience. They simply exceed their</p>
<p>perception capacity.</p>
<p>The connection between experience, perception, and concept forma-</p>
<p>ion, that is, cognition, is, we now know, infinitely subtler and
richer</p>
<p>han any earlier philosopher imagined. But one fact is proven and</p>
<p>comes out strongly in the most disparate work, for example, that
of</p>
<p>Piaget in Switzerland, that of B. F. Skinner of Harvard, or that
of</p>
<p>Jerome Bruner (also of Harvard). Percept and concept in the
learner,</p>
<p>whether child or adult, are not separate. We cannot perceive unless
we</p>
<p>also conceive. But we also cannot form concepts unless we can</p>
<p>perceive. To communicate a concept is impossible unless the
recipient</p>
<p>can perceive it, that is, unless it is within his perception.</p>
<p>There is a very old saying among writers: “Difficulties with a
sen-</p>
<p>ence always mean confused thinking. It is not the sentence that
needs</p>
<p>straightening out, it is the thought behind it.’’ In writing we
attempt, of</p>
<p>course, to communicate with ourselves. An unclear sentence is one</p>
<p>hat exceeds our own capacity for perception. Working on the sen-</p>
<p>ence, that is, working on what is normally called communications,</p>
<p>cannot solve the problem. We have to work on our own concepts
first</p>
<p>o be able to understand what we are trying to say-and only then
can</p>
<p>we write the sentence.</p>
<p>In communicating, whatever the medium, the first question has to</p>
<p>be, “Is this communication within the recipient’s range of
perception?</p>
<p>Can he receive it?“</p>
<p>The “range of perception“ is, of course, physiological and
largely</p>
<p>(though not entirely) set by physical limitations of man’s animal
body.</p>
<p>When we speak of communications, however, the most important</p>
<p>limitations on perception are usually cultural and emotional rather
than</p>
<p>physical. That fanatics are not being convinced by rational
arguments,</p>
<p>we have known for thousands of years. Now we are beginning to</p>
<p>understand that it is not “argument“ that is lacking. Fanatics do
not</p>
<p>have the ability to perceive a communication which goes beyond
their</p>
<p>range of emotions. Before this is possible, their emotions would
have</p>
<p>o be altered. In other words, no one is really “in touch with
reality“,</p>
<p>if by that we mean complete openness to evidence. The distinction</p>
<p>between sanity and paranoia is not in the ability to perceive, but in
the</p>
<p>ability to learn, that is, in the ability to change one’s emotions on
the</p>
<p>basis of experience.</p>
<p>That perception is conditioned by what we are capable of
perceiving</p>
<p>was realized forty years ago by the most quoted but probably
least</p>
<p>heeded of all students of organization, Mary Parker Follett,
especially</p>
<p>in her collected essays, Dynamic Administration (London: Manage-</p>
<p>ment Publications Trust, 1949). Follett taught that a disagreement or
a</p>
<p>conflict is likely not to be about the answers, or, indeed, about</p>
<p>anything ostensible. It is, in most cases, the result of incongruity
in</p>
<p>perceptions. What A sees so vividly, B does not see at all. And,</p>
<p>Information, Communications, and Understanding 325</p>
<p>herefore, what A argues has no pertinence to B’s concerns, and
vice</p>
<p>versa. Both, Follett argued, are likely to see reality. But each is
likely</p>
<p>o see a different aspect thereof. The world, and not only the
material</p>
<p>world, is multidimensional. Yet one can only see one dimension at
a</p>
<p>ime. One rarely realizes that there could be other dimensions, and
that</p>
<p>something that is so obvious to us and so clearly validated by
our</p>
<p>emotional experience has other dimensions, a back and sides,
which</p>
<p>are entirely different and which, therefore, lead to entirely
different</p>
<p>perception. The old story about the blind men and the elephant in</p>
<p>which every one of them, upon encountering this strange beast,
feels</p>
<p>one of the elephant’s parts, his leg, his trunk, his hide, and
reports an</p>
<p>entirely different conclusion, each held tenaciously, is simply a
story</p>
<p>of the human condition. And there is no possibility of
communication</p>
<p>until this is understood and until he who has felt the hide of
the</p>
<p>elephant goes over to him who has felt the leg and feels the leg</p>
<p>himself. There is no possibility of communications, in other
words,</p>
<p>unless we first know what the recipient, the true communicator,
can</p>
<p>see and why.</p>
<p>Communication is Expectations</p>
<p>We perceive, as a rule, what we expect to perceive. We see
largely</p>
<p>what we expect to see, and we hear largely what we expect to
hear.</p>
<p>That the unexpected may be resented is not the important thing-</p>
<p>hough most of the writers on communications in business or
govern-</p>
<p>ment think it is. What is truly important is that the unexpected
is</p>
<p>usually not received at all. It is either not seen or heard but
ignored. Or</p>
<p>it is misunderstood, that is, mis-seen as the expected or misheard as
the</p>
<p>expected.</p>
<p>On this we now have a century or more of experimentation. The</p>
<p>results are quite unambiguous. The human mind attempts to fit
impres-</p>
<p>sions and stimuli into a frame of expectations. It resists vigorously
any</p>
<p>attempts to make it “change its mind“, that is, to perceive what it
does</p>
<p>not expect to perceive or not to perceive what it expects to
perceive. It</p>
<p>is, of course, possible to alert the human mind to the fact that what
it</p>
<p>perceives is contrary to its expectations. But this first requires
that we</p>
<p>understand what it expects to perceive. It then requires that there
be an</p>
<p>unmistakable signal-“this is different“, that is, a shock which
breaks</p>
<p>continuity. A “gradual“ change in which the mind is supposedly
led</p>
<p>by small, incremental steps to realize that what is perceived is not
what</p>
<p>it expects to perceive will not work. It will rather reinforce the
expecta-</p>
<p>ions and will make it even more certain that what will be perceived
is</p>
<p>what the recipient expects to perceive.</p>
<p>Before we can communicate, we must, therefore, know what the</p>
<p>recipient expects to see and to hear. Only then can we know
whether</p>
<p>communication can utilize his expectations-and what they are–or</p>
<p>whether there is need for the “shock of alienation“, for an
“awaken-</p>
<p>ing“ that breaks through the recipient’s expectations and forces him
to</p>
<p>realize that the unexpected is happening.</p>
<p>Communication is Involvement</p>
<p>Many years ago psychologists stumbled on a strange phenomenon in</p>
<p>heir studies of memory, a phenomenon that, at first, upset all
their</p>
<p>hypotheses. In order to test memory, the psychologists compiled a
list</p>
<p>of words to be shown to their experimental subjects for varying
times</p>
<p>as a test of their retention capacity. As control, a list of
nonsense</p>
<p>words, mere jumbles of letters, were devised to find out to what
extent</p>
<p>understanding influenced memory. Much to the surprise of these
early</p>
<p>experimenters almost a century ago or so, their subjects (mostly</p>
<p>students, of course) showed totally uneven memory retention of
indi-</p>
<p>vidual words. More surprising, they showed amazingly high
retention</p>
<p>of the nonsense words. The explanation of the first phenomenon is</p>
<p>fairly obvious. Words are not mere information. They do carry
emo-</p>
<p>ional charges. And, therefore, words with unpleasant or
threatening</p>
<p>associations tend to be suppressed, word with pleasant
associations</p>
<p>retained. In fact, this selective retention by emotional association
has</p>
<p>since been used to construct tests for emotional disorders and
for</p>
<p>personality profiles.</p>
<p>The relatively high retention rate of nonsense words was a
greater</p>
<p>problem. It was expected, after all, that no one would really
remember</p>
<p>words that had no meaning at all. But it has become clear over
the</p>
<p>years that the memory for these words, though limited, exists
precisely</p>
<p>because these words have no meaning. For this reason, they also
make</p>
<p>no demand. They are truly neuter. In respect to them, memory
could</p>
<p>Information, Communications, and Understanding 327</p>
<p>be said to be truly mechanical, showing neither emotional
preference</p>
<p>nor emotional rejection.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon, known to every newspaper editor, is the</p>
<p>amazingly high readership and retention of the fillers, the little
three-</p>
<p>or five-line bits of irrelevant incidental information that are being
used</p>
<p>o balance a page. Why should anybody want to read, let alone</p>
<p>remember, that it first became fashionable to wear
different-colored</p>
<p>hose on each leg at the court of some long-forgotten duke? Why
should</p>
<p>anybody want to read, let alone remember, when and where baking</p>
<p>powder was first used? Yet there is no doubt that these little
titbits of</p>
<p>irrelevancy are read and, above all, that they are remembered far
better</p>
<p>han almost anything in the daily paper except the great screaming</p>
<p>headlines of the catastrophes. The answer is that these fillers make
no</p>
<p>demands. It is precisely their total irrelevancy that accounts for
their</p>
<p>being remembered.</p>
<p>Communications are always propaganda. The emitter always wants</p>
<p>“to get something across.“ Propaganda, we now know, is both a
great</p>
<p>deal more powerful than the rationalists with their belief in
“open</p>
<p>discussion“ believe, and a great deal less powerful than the
myth-</p>
<p>makers of propaganda, for example, a Dr. Goebbels in the Nazi</p>
<p>rkgime, believed and wanted us to believe. Indeed, the danger of
total</p>
<p>propaganda is not that the propaganda will be believed. The danger
is</p>
<p>hat nothing will be believed and that every communication becomes</p>
<p>suspect. In the end, no communication is being received any more.</p>
<p>Everything anyone says is considered a demand and is resisted,
re-</p>
<p>sented, and in effect not heard at all. The end results of total
propagan-</p>
<p>da are not fanatics, by cynics-but this, of course, may be even
greater</p>
<p>and more dangerous corruption.</p>
<p>Communication, in other words, always makes demands. It always</p>
<p>demands that the recipient become somebody, do something, believe</p>
<p>something. It always appeals to motivation If, in other words,
commu-</p>
<p>nication fits in with the aspirations, the values, the purposes of
the</p>
<p>recipient, it is powerful. If it goes against his aspirations, his
values,</p>
<p>his motivations, it is likely not to be received at all, or, at best,
to be</p>
<p>resisted. Of course, at its most powerful, communication brings
about</p>
<p>conversion, that is, a change of personality, of values, beliefs,
aspira-</p>
<p>ions. But this is the rare, existential event, and one against which
the</p>
<p>basic psychological forces of every human being are strongly
orga-</p>
<p>nized. Even the Lord, the Bible reports, first had to strike Saul
blind</p>
<p>before he could raise him as Paul. Communications aiming at
conver-</p>
<p>sion demand surrender. By and large, therefore, there is no
communi-</p>
<p>cation unless the message can key in to the recipient’s own values,
at</p>
<p>least to some degree.</p>
<p>Communication and Information are Different</p>
<p>and Largely Opposite–Yet Interdependent</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Where communication is perception, information is logic. As</li>
</ol>
<p>such, information is purely formal and has no meaning. It is
imperson-</p>
<p>al rather than interpersonal. The more it can be freed of the
human</p>
<p>component, that is, of such things as emotions and values,
expecta-</p>
<p>ions and perceptions, the more valid and reliable does it become.</p>
<p>Indeed, it becomes increasingly informative.</p>
<p>All through history, the problem has been how to glean a little</p>
<p>information out of communications, that is, out of relationships
be-</p>
<p>ween people, based on perception. All through history, the
problem</p>
<p>has been to isolate the information content from an abundance of</p>
<p>perception. Now, all of a sudden, we have the capacity to provide</p>
<p>information-both because of the conceptual work of the logicians,</p>
<p>especially the symbolic logic of Russell and Whitehead, and
because</p>
<p>of the technical work on data processing and data storage, that is,
of</p>
<p>course, especially because of the computer and its tremendous
capacity</p>
<p>o store, manipulate, and transmit data. Now, in other words, we
have</p>
<p>he opposite problem from the one mankind has always been
struggling</p>
<p>with. Now we have the problem of handling information per se,</p>
<p>devoid of any communication content.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>The requirements for effective information are the opposite of</li>
</ol>
<p>hose for effective communication. Information is, for instance,
al-</p>
<p>ways specific. We perceive a configuration in communications; but
we</p>
<p>convey specific individual data in the information process.
Indeed,</p>
<p>information is, above all, a principle of economy. The fewer data</p>
<p>needed, the better the information. And an overload of
information,</p>
<p>hat is, anything much beyond what is truly needed, leads to a
com-</p>
<p>plete information blackout. It does not enrich, but impoverishes.</p>
<p>Information, Communications, and Understanding 329</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>At the same time, information presupposes communication. In-</li>
</ol>
<p>formation is always encoded. To be received, let alone to be used,
the</p>
<p>code must be known and understood by the recipient. This requires</p>
<p>prior agreement, that is, some communication. At the very least,
the</p>
<p>recipient has to know what the data pertain to. Are the figures on
a</p>
<p>piece of computer tape the height of mountain tops or the cash
balances</p>
<p>of Federal Reserve member banks? In either case, the recipient
would</p>
<p>have to know what mountains are or what banks are to get any
infor-</p>
<p>mation out of the data.</p>
<p>The prototype information system may well have been the peculiar</p>
<p>language known as Armee Deutsch (Army German), which served as</p>
<p>language of command in the Imperial Austrian Army prior to 1918.
A</p>
<p>polyglot army in which officers, noncommissioned officers, and
men</p>
<p>often had no language in common, it functioned remarkably well
with</p>
<p>fewer than two hundred specific words, “fire“, for instance, or
“at</p>
<p>ease“, each of which had only one totally unambiguous meaning.
The</p>
<p>meaning was always an action. And the words were learned in and</p>
<p>hrough actions, that is, in what behaviorists now call operant
condi-</p>
<p>ioning. The tensions in the Austrian Army after many decades of</p>
<p>nationalist turmoil were very great indeed. Social intercourse
between</p>
<p>members of different nationalities serving in the same unit
became</p>
<p>increasingly difficult, if not impossible. But to the very end,
the</p>
<p>information system functioned. It was completely formal,
completely</p>
<p>rigid, completely logical in that each word had only one possible</p>
<p>meaning; and it rested on completely preestablished communication</p>
<p>regarding the specific response to a certain set of sound waves.
This</p>
<p>example, however, shows also that the effectiveness of an
information</p>
<p>system depends on the willingness and ability to think through
care-</p>
<p>fully what information is needed by whom for what purposes, and
then</p>
<p>on the systematic creation of communication between the various</p>
<p>parties to the system as to the meaning of each specific input
and</p>
<p>output. The effectiveness, in other words, depends on the
preestablish-</p>
<p>ment of communication.</p>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li>Communication communicates better the more levels of meaning</li>
</ol>
<p>it has and the less possible it is, therefore, to quantify it.</p>
<p>Medieval aesthetics held that a work of art communicates on a
num-</p>
<p>ber of levels, at least three if not four: the literal, the
metaphorical, the</p>
<p>allegorical, and the symbolic. The work of art that most
consciously</p>
<p>converted this theory into artistic practice was, of course,
Dante’s</p>
<p>Divina Cornmedia. If, by information we mean something that can
be</p>
<p>quantified, then the Divina Commedia is without any information</p>
<p>content whatever. But it is precisely the ambiguity, the multiplicity
of</p>
<p>levels on which this book can be read, from being a fairy tale to
being a</p>
<p>grand synthesis of metaphysics, that makes it the overpowering
work</p>
<p>of art it is, and the immediate communication which it has been
to</p>
<p>generations of readers.</p>
<p>Communications, in other words, may not be dependent on informa-</p>
<p>ion. Indeed, the most perfect communications may be purely shared</p>
<p>experiences, without any logic whatever. Perception has primacy
rath-</p>
<p>er than information.</p>
<p>I fully realize that this summary of what we have learned is
gross</p>
<p>oversimplification. I fully realize that I have glossed over some of
the</p>
<p>most hotly contested issues in psychology and perception. Indeed,
I</p>
<p>may well be accused of brushing aside most of the issues which
the</p>
<p>students of learning and of perception would themselves consider</p>
<p>central and important.</p>
<p>But my aim has, of course, not been to survey these big areas. My</p>
<p>concern is not with learning or with perception. It is with
communica-</p>
<p>ions, and, in particular, with communications in the large
organiza-</p>
<p>ion, be it business enterprise, government agency, university, or</p>
<p>armed service.</p>
<p>This summary might also be criticized for being trite, if not
obvious.</p>
<p>No one, it might be said, could possibly be surprised at its
statements.</p>
<p>They say what everybody knows. But whether this be so or not, it
is</p>
<p>not what everybody does. On the contrary, the logical implications
of</p>
<p>hese apparently simple and obvious statements for communications
in</p>
<p>organizations are at odds with current practice and, indeed, deny</p>
<p>validity to the honest and serious efforts to communicate which
we</p>
<p>have been making for many decades now.</p>
<p>What, then, can our knowledge and our experience teach us about</p>
<p>communications in organizations, about the reasons for our
failures,</p>
<p>and about the prerequisites for success in the future?</p>
<p>Information, Communications, and Understanding 331</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For centuries we have attempted communication downwards.</li>
</ol>
<p>This, however, cannot work, no matter how hard and how
intelligently</p>
<p>we try. It cannot work, first, because it focuses on what we want
to</p>
<p>say. It assumes, in other words, that the utterer communicates. But
we</p>
<p>know that all he does is utter. Communication is the act of the</p>
<p>recipient. What we have been trying to do is to work on the
emitter,</p>
<p>specifically on the manager, the administrator, the commander, to</p>
<p>make him capable of being a better communicator. But all one can</p>
<p>communicate downwards are commands, that is, prearranged signals.</p>
<p>One cannot communicate downwards anything connected with under-</p>
<p>standing, let alone with motivation. This requires communication</p>
<p>upwards; from those who perceive to those who want to reach their</p>
<p>perception.</p>
<p>This does not mean that managers should stop working on clarity
in</p>
<p>what they say or write. Far from it. But it does mean that how we
say</p>
<p>something comes only after we have learned what to say. And this</p>
<p>cannot be found out by “talking to“, no matter how well it is
being</p>
<p>done. “Letters to the Employees“, no matter how well done, will be
a</p>
<p>waste unless the writer knows what employees can perceive, expect
to</p>
<p>perceive, and want to do. They are a waste unless they are based on
the</p>
<p>recipient’s rather than the emitter’s perception.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>But “listening“ does not work either. The Human Relations</li>
</ol>
<p>school of Elton Mayo, forty years ago, recognized the failure of
the</p>
<p>raditional approach to communications. Its answer+specially as</p>
<p>developed in Mayo’s two famous books, The Human Problems of an</p>
<p>Industrial Civilization (2nd ed, Boston: Harvard University, 1946)
and</p>
<p>The Social Problems of an Industrial Civilization (Boston:
Harvard</p>
<p>University, 1945)-was to enjoin listening. Instead of starting out
with</p>
<p>what I, that is, the executive, want to get across, the executive
should</p>
<p>start out by finding out what subordinates want to know, are
interested</p>
<p>in, are, in other words, receptive to. To this day, the human
relations</p>
<p>prescription, though rarely practiced, remains the classic
formula.</p>
<p>Of course, listening is a prerequisite to communication. But it is
not</p>
<p>adequate, and it cannot, by itself, work. Perhaps the reason why it
is</p>
<p>not being used widely, despite the popularity of the slogan, is
precisely</p>
<p>hat, where tried, it has failed to work. Listening first assumes that
the</p>
<p>superior will understand what he is being told. It assumes, in
other</p>
<p>words, that the subordinates can communicate. It is hard to see,</p>
<p>however, why the subordinate should be able to do what his
superior</p>
<p>cannot do. In fact, there is no reason for assuming he can. There is
no</p>
<p>reason, in other words, to believe that listening results any less
in</p>
<p>misunderstanding and miscommunications than does talking. In
addi-</p>
<p>ion, the theory of listening does not take into account that
communica-</p>
<p>ions is involvement. It does not bring out the subordinate’s
prefer-</p>
<p>ences and desires, his values and aspirations. It may explain the</p>
<p>reasons for misunderstanding. But it does not lay down a basis
for</p>
<p>understanding.</p>
<p>This is not to say that listening is wrong, any more than the
futility</p>
<p>of downward communications furnishes any argument against
attempts</p>
<p>o write well, to say things clearly and simply, and to speak the</p>
<p>language of those whom one addresses rather than one’s own
jargon.</p>
<p>Indeed, the realization that communications have to be upward-r</p>
<p>rather that they have to start with the recipient, rather than the
emitter,</p>
<p>which underlies the concept of listening-is absolutely sound and</p>
<p>vital. But listening is only the starting point.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>More and better information does not solve the communications</li>
</ol>
<p>problem, does not bridge the communications gap. On the contrary,</p>
<p>he more information the greater is the need for functioning and</p>
<p>effective communication. The more information, in other words,
the</p>
<p>greater is the communications gap likely to be.</p>
<p>The more impersonal and formal the information process in the
first</p>
<p>place, the more will it depend on prior agreement on meaning and</p>
<p>application, that is, on communications. In the second place, the
more</p>
<p>effective the information process, the more impersonal and formal
will</p>
<p>it become, the more will it separate human beings and thereby
require</p>
<p>separate, but also much greater, efforts, to reestablish the
human</p>
<p>relationship, the relationship of communication. It may be said that
the</p>
<p>effectiveness of the information process will depend increasingly
on</p>
<p>our ability to communicate, and that, in the absence of effective</p>
<p>communication-that is, in the present situation-the information
rev-</p>
<p>olution cannot really produce information. All it can produce is
data.</p>
<p>It can also be said-and this may well be more important-that the</p>
<p>est of an information system will increasingly be the degree to
which</p>
<p>it frees human beings from concern with information and allows
them</p>
<p>o work on communications. The test, in particular, of the
computer</p>
<p>Information, Communications, and Understanding 333</p>
<p>will be how much time it gives executives and professionals on
all</p>
<p>levels for direct, personal, face-to-face relationships with other
people.</p>
<p>It is fashionable today to measure the utilization of a computer
by</p>
<p>he number of hours it runs during one day. But this is not even a</p>
<p>measurement of the computer’s efficiency. It is purely a
measurement</p>
<p>of input. The only measurement of output is the degree to which</p>
<p>availability of information enables human beings not to control, that
is,</p>
<p>not to spend time trying to get a little information on what
happened</p>
<p>yesterday. And the only measurement of this, in turn, is the amount
of</p>
<p>ime that becomes available for the job only human beings can do,
the</p>
<p>job of communication. By this test, of course, almost no computer</p>
<p>oday is being used properly. Most of them are being misused, that
is,</p>
<p>are being used to justify spending even more time on control
rather</p>
<p>han to relieve human beings from controlling by giving them
informa-</p>
<p>ion. The reason for this is quite clearly the lack of prior
communica-</p>
<p>ion, that is, of agreement and decision on what information is
needed,</p>
<p>by whom and for what purposes, and what it means operationally.
The</p>
<p>reason for the misuse of the computer is, so to speak, the lack
of</p>
<p>anything comparable to the Armee Deutsch of yesterday’s much-</p>
<p>ridiculed Imperial Austrian Army with its two hundred words of</p>
<p>command which even the dumbest recruit could learn in two weeks’</p>
<p>ime.</p>
<p>The Information Explosion, in other words, is the most impelling</p>
<p>reason to go to work on communications. Indeed, the frightening</p>
<p>communications gap all around us-between management and work-</p>
<p>ers; between business and government; between faculty and
students,</p>
<p>and between both of them and university administration; between</p>
<p>producers and consumers; and so on-may well reflect in some mea-</p>
<p>sure the tremendous increase in information without a
commensurate</p>
<p>increase in communications.</p>
<p>Can we then say anything constructive about communication? Can we</p>
<p>do anything? We can say that communication has to start from the</p>
<p>intended recipient of communications rather than from the emitter.
In</p>
<p>erms of traditional organization we have to start upward.
Downward</p>
<p>communications cannot work and do not work. They come after</p>
<p>upward communications have successfully been established. They
are</p>
<p>reaction rather than action, response rather than initiative.</p>
<p>But we can also say that it is not enough to listen. The upward</p>
<p>communication must first be focused on something that both
recipient</p>
<p>and emitter can perceive, focused on something that is common to
both</p>
<p>of them. And second, it must be focused on the motivation of the</p>
<p>intended recipient. It must, from the beginning, be informed by
his</p>
<p>values, beliefs, and aspirations.</p>
<p>One example-but only an example: there have been promising</p>
<p>results with organizational communication that started out with
the</p>
<p>demand by the superior that the subordinate think through and
present</p>
<p>o the superior his own conclusions as to what major contribution to
the</p>
<p>organization-or to the unit within the organization-the
subordinate</p>
<p>should be expected to perform and should be held accountable for.</p>
<p>What the subordinate then comes up with is rarely what the
superior</p>
<p>expects. Indeed, the first aim of the exercise is precisely to bring
out</p>
<p>he divergence in perception between superior and subordinate. But
the</p>
<p>perception is focused, and focused on something that is real to
both</p>
<p>parties. To realize that they see the same reality differently is in
itself</p>
<p>already communication.</p>
<p>Second, in this approach, the intended recipient of communica-</p>
<p>ion-in this case the subordinate-is given access to experience
that</p>
<p>enables him to understand. He is given access to the reality of
decision</p>
<p>making, the problems of priorities, the choice between what one
likes</p>
<p>o do and what the situation demands and, above all, the
responsibility</p>
<p>for a decision. He may not see the situation the same way the
superior</p>
<p>does-in fact, he rarely will or even should. But he may gain an
under-</p>
<p>standing of the complexity of the superior’s situation, and above all
of</p>
<p>he fact that the complexity is not of the superior’s making, but
is</p>
<p>inherent in the situation itself.</p>
<p>Finally, the communication, even if it consists of a “no“ to the
sub-</p>
<p>ordinate’s conclusions, is firmly focused on the aspirations,
values,</p>
<p>and motivation of the intended recipient. In fact, it starts out with
the</p>
<p>question, “What would you want to do?“ It may then end up with
the</p>
<p>command, “This is what I tell you to do.“ But at least it forces the
su-</p>
<p>perior to realize that he is overriding the desires of the
subordinate. It</p>
<p>forces him to explain, if not to try to persuade. At least he knows
that</p>
<p>he has a problem-and so does the subordinate.</p>
<p>A similar approach has worked in another organizational situation
in</p>
<p>which communication has been traditionally absent: the
performance</p>
<p>Information, Communications, and Understanding 335</p>
<p>appraisal, and especially the appraisal interview. Performance
ap-</p>
<p>praisal is today standard in large organizations (except in Japan,
where</p>
<p>promotion and pay go by seniority so that performance appraisal
would</p>
<p>serve little purpose). We know that most people want to know
where</p>
<p>hey stand. One of the most common complaints of employees in</p>
<p>organizations is, indeed, that they are not being appraised and are
not</p>
<p>being told whether they do well or poorly.</p>
<p>The appraisal forms may be filled out. But the appraisal interview
in</p>
<p>which the appraiser is expected to discuss his performance with a
man</p>
<p>is almost never conducted. The exceptions are a few organizations
in</p>
<p>which performance appraisals are considered a communications tool</p>
<p>rather than a rating device. This means specifically that the
perfor-</p>
<p>mance appraisal starts out with the question, “What has this man
done</p>
<p>well?“ It then asks, “And what, therefore, should he be able to
do</p>
<p>well?“ And then it asks, “And what would he have to learn or to</p>
<p>acquire to be able to get the most from his capacities and
achieve-</p>
<p>ments?“ This, first, focuses on specific achievement. It focuses
on</p>
<p>hings the employee himself is likely to perceive clearly and, in
fact,</p>
<p>gladly. It also focuses on his own aspirations, values, and
desires.</p>
<p>Weaknesses are then seen as limitations to what the employee
himself</p>
<p>can do well and wants to do, rather than as defects. Indeed, the
proper</p>
<p>conclusion from this approach to appraisal is not the question,
“What</p>
<p>should the employee do?“ but “What should the organization and I,</p>
<p>his boss, do?“ A proper conclusion is not “What does this
communi-</p>
<p>cate to the employee?“ It is “What does this communicate to both
of</p>
<p>us, subordinate and superior?“</p>
<p>These are only examples, and rather insignificant ones at that.
But</p>
<p>perhaps they illustrate conclusions to which our experience with
com-</p>
<p>munications-largely an experience of failure-and the work in
learn-</p>
<p>ing, memory, perception, and motivation point.</p>
<p>The start of communications in organization must be to get the</p>
<p>intended recipient himself to try to communicate. This requires a
focus</p>
<p>on (a) the impersonal but common task, and (b) on the intended</p>
<p>recipient’s values, achievements, and aspirations. It also requires
the</p>
<p>experience of responsibility.</p>
<p>Perception is limited by what can be perceived and geared to what</p>
<p>one expects to perceive. Perception, in other words, presupposes
ex-</p>
<p>perience. communication within organization, therefore,
presupposes</p>
<p>hat the members of the organization have the foundation of
experience</p>
<p>o receive and perceive. The artist can convey this experience in</p>
<p>symbolical form: he can communicate what his readers or viewers</p>
<p>have never experienced. But ordinary managers, administrators,
and</p>
<p>professors are not likely to be artists. The recipients must,
therefore,</p>
<p>have actual experience themselves and directly rather than through
the</p>
<p>vicarious symbols.</p>
<p>Communications in organization demands that the masses, whether</p>
<p>hey be employees or students, share in the responsibility of
decisions</p>
<p>o the fullest possible extent. They must understand because they
have</p>
<p>been through it, rather than accept because it is being explained
to</p>
<p>hem.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the German trade-union leader, a faithful
social-</p>
<p>ist, who was shattered by his first exposure to the deliberations of
the</p>
<p>Board of Overseers of a large company to which he had been elected
as</p>
<p>an employee member. That the amount of money available was
limited</p>
<p>and that, indeed, there was very little money available for all the
de-</p>
<p>mands that had to be met, was one surprise. But the pain and
complex-</p>
<p>ity of the decisions between various investments, for example,
be-</p>
<p>ween modernizing the plant to safeguard workers’ jobs and
building</p>
<p>workers’ houses to safeguard their health and family life, was a
much</p>
<p>bigger and totally unexpected experience. But, as he told me with
a</p>
<p>half-sheepish, half-rueful grin, the greatest shocker was the
realization</p>
<p>hat all the things he considered important turned out to be
irrelevant to</p>
<p>he decisions in which he found himself taking an active and
responsi-</p>
<p>ble part. Yet this man was neither stupid nor dogmatic. He was
simply</p>
<p>inexperienced-and, therefore, inaccessible to communication.</p>
<p>The traditional defence of paternalism has always been “It’s a</p>
<p>complex world; it needs the expert, the man who knows best.“ But</p>
<p>paternalism, as our work in perception, learning, and motivation
is</p>
<p>beginning to bring out, really can work only in a simple world.
When</p>
<p>people can understand what Papa does because they share his
experi-</p>
<p>ences and his perception, then Papa can actually make the decisions
for</p>
<p>hem. In a complex world there is need for a shared experience in
the</p>
<p>decisions, or there is no common perception, no communications,
and,</p>
<p>herefore, neither acceptance of the decisions, nor ability to carry
them</p>
<p>out. The ability to understand presupposes prior communication.
It</p>
<p>presupposes agreement on meaning.</p>
<p>Information, Communications, and Understanding 337</p>
<p>There will be no communication, in sum, if it is conceived as
going</p>
<p>from the “1“ to the “thou.“ Communication only works from one</p>
<p>member of ‘us’ to another. Communications in organization-and
this</p>
<p>may be the true lesson of our communications failure and the true</p>
<p>measure of our communications need-are not a means of organiza-</p>
<p>ion. They are a mode of organization.</p>
