<h4 id="a-view-of-japan-through-japanese-art">A View of Japan through
Japanese Art</h4>
<p>Japan, as everybody knows, is a country of rigid rules and of</p>
<p>individual subordination to a collective will. It is the country
where the</p>
<p>young college student goes hiking in the mountains, but turns boot
and</p>
<p>pack over to a younger brother or sister upon graduation. It is
the</p>
<p>country where the student is a radical in college but becomes a
faithful</p>
<p>conservative upon being hired by Mitsubishi Bank or Ministry of</p>
<p>Finance. It is the country where a young woman wears one kind of</p>
<p>kimono until the day of her wedding, and then puts on the married</p>
<p>woman’s kimono for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>Japan is a country where junior high school graduates become man-</p>
<p>ual workers, high school graduates become clerks, and college
gradu-</p>
<p>ates become managers and professionals-all three thus slotted for
the</p>
<p>rest of their lives by the school-leaving diploma. It is a country
where</p>
<p>here is lifetime commitment to one employer. Japan is also, as</p>
<p>everyone knows, the country of mutual obligations, in which speech
is</p>
<p>minutely regulated by social relationship and status. It is the
country of</p>
<p>“Japan Inc. ,“ where conflicting interests pull together for the
greater</p>
<p>glory of the common economy. The best-known-and best-book on</p>
<p>Japanese social organization and institutions, Japanese Society
by</p>
<p>Chie Nakane, depicts the ie, the community of the clan or tribe, as
the</p>
<p>organizing reality within which the individual exists as a member</p>
<p>First published in Song of the Brush, Japanese Paintings from the
Sans6 Collection,</p>
<p>ed. John M. Rosenfield and Henry Trubner (Seattle, Wash.: Seattle Art
Museum,</p>
<p>1979).</p>
<p>rather than as a person. Whenever Japanese and Western
(especially</p>
<p>American) scholars meet, in any discipline and on any subject,
the</p>
<p>Japanese at once contrast Japanese cooperation with the excessive</p>
<p>competition and rampant diversity of the West.</p>
<p>Yet the most pervasive trait of all Japanese art is its
individualism.</p>
<p>In every major period of artistic activity in the West there has been
one</p>
<p>universal style; we speak of the Hellenistic, of the Romanesque and
the</p>
<p>Gothic, the Renaissance and the Baroque. But every period of
great</p>
<p>artistic activity in Japan has been characterized by diversity.
Indeed, in</p>
<p>he arts, and especially in painting, the contrast is properly
between</p>
<p>Western conformity and the “excessive diversity“ of Japan. During</p>
<p>he Edo period (1 603-1 867), the Japanese tendency to diversity</p>
<p>reached its apogee. In painting alone, over a dozen major schools</p>
<p>flourished, along with countless subschools. There is nothing
compa-</p>
<p>rable in other cultures to the flamboyant diversity of the last
great</p>
<p>artistic era of premodern Japan.</p>
<p>The Japanese scholars and experts who castigate American exces-</p>
<p>sive competition, and who contrast it to its disadvantage with
Japanese</p>
<p>cooperation, think of competition among businesses in the
marketplace</p>
<p>or of competition for promotion within the management group in a</p>
<p>company. They never, it seems, think of the Japanese school
system.</p>
<p>Yet every American recoils in horror when told that a Japanese
school-</p>
<p>boy, ten years old, will applaud with joy upon hearing that his
best</p>
<p>friend is ill and will have to miss a week or two of school. The
friend</p>
<p>will thus fall behind in the competition for the examination that
will</p>
<p>decide on the few who will make it into the prestigious junior
high</p>
<p>school.</p>
<p>And as to “Japan Inc.,“ there is no commercial rivalry and compe-</p>
<p>ition in the West that compares with the fierce ruthlessness with
which</p>
<p>he major Japanese industrial groups, the zaibatsu, fight one
another.</p>
<p>If Mitsubishi goes into a new field, be it synthetic fibers or
electronics</p>
<p>or shipbuilding. Mitsui and Sumitomo have to go into it too-never</p>
<p>mind that overcapacity already exists in that industry worldwide.
And</p>
<p>Japanese political parties are not disciplined monoliths; they are
not an</p>
<p>ie. They are loose congeries of fiercely competing factions.</p>
<p>The Japanese are probably the world’s best animal painters. In
the</p>
<p>West, the few animal painters are specialists, a Rosa Bonheur or</p>
<p>George Stubbs, for instance. In Japan almost every painter
painted</p>
<p>A View of Japan through Japanese Art 365</p>
<p>animals. The Japanese took some traditions of animal painting
from</p>
<p>he Chinese: the kachdga (flower-and-bird) painting, for instance.
But</p>
<p>most animals, and especially the birds, in Japanese painting
express</p>
<p>purely native Japanese values, traditions, and perceptions.</p>
<p>Nothing I know expresses one basic trait of the Japanese as well
as</p>
<p>hese bird paintings do: the capacity for pure enjoyment. It is the
same</p>
<p>capacity one gets at a Japanese picnic or at a simple folk dance in
an</p>
<p>empty lot on a summer’s night. It is the capacity for pure
enjoyment</p>
<p>hat makes pompous company presidents and grave scholars play at
the</p>
<p>silliest children’s games at a party, without embarrassment or
reti-</p>
<p>cence. It is the capacity for pure enjoyment that can be seen in
parks on</p>
<p>Sundays where young Japanese fathers romp with their children. It is
a</p>
<p>quality of immediacy that is present in the most sophisticated
Japanese</p>
<p>artwork or novel, and that is the essence of the haiku. The
traditional</p>
<p>Japanese animal or bird painting always looks ludicrously
simple-just</p>
<p>a few strokes of the brush. Yet it is done with complete control
of</p>
<p>brush, ink, and composition. It also expresses the artists’
intuitive,</p>
<p>immediate projection of their own selves into the spirit of the birds
or</p>
<p>he frog. These Japanese paintings are a hymn to diversity and
sponta-</p>
<p>neity in keeping with the first of the modern English poets, the
late</p>
<p>Victorian Gerard Manley Hopkins, who sang, “Glory be to God for</p>
<p>dappled things. “</p>
<p>And yet the cooperation, the mutual obligations, the lifetime
com-</p>
<p>mitment to one employer, the ie, and even “Japan Inc.,“ are not</p>
<p>myths. Central to Japan is constant and continuing polarity
between</p>
<p>ight, enveloping community-supportive but demanding subordina-</p>
<p>ion to its rules-and competitive individualism demanding sponta-</p>
<p>neity.</p>
<p>Japanese artists of the eighteenth century were highly
individualis-</p>
<p>ic, yet most considered themselves as belonging to a school-Nanga</p>
<p>or Rimpa or Shijb, for instance. The few who did not-Shbhaku,</p>
<p>Rosetsu, Jakuchii-are called “eccentrics“ in Japan. And if an
artist</p>
<p>starts in a school and then outgrows it and develops his own
style,</p>
<p>Japanese propriety demands that there be a violent break, like
the</p>
<p>confrontations of a Kabuki drama. Nagasawa Rosetsu (1755-99), for</p>
<p>instance, is reported to have broken violently with Maruyama Okyo</p>
<p>(1733-95), whose student he originally was, though the record
shows</p>
<p>unambiguously that the two actually kept on working together and
that</p>
<p>Okyo entrusted Rosetsu with important and confidential
commissions.</p>
<p>Similarly, a century earlier, Kusumi Morikage (d. before 1700)
was</p>
<p>reported to have been excommunicated by, and exiled from, the
atelier</p>
<p>of Kan6 Tanyii (1602-74) when he went his own way, though the</p>
<p>record shows a close and continuing family relationship between
the</p>
<p>wo artists.</p>
<p>Even today, in a modern, Westernized Japan, it is not considered</p>
<p>proper for a young man to be on his own and not to belong to an
orga-</p>
<p>nization, an ie. My interpreter on my first lecture tour in Japan,
more</p>
<p>han twenty years ago, was a young Japanese who had gone to</p>
<p>graduate school in the United States and who had then established
his</p>
<p>own marketing consulting practice in Tokyo. He was, I found out,
not</p>
<p>welcome in his father-in-law’s house. When I met the
father-in-law,</p>
<p>who was dean at a university where I lectured, I asked him what he
had</p>
<p>against his son-in-law. “He is barely thirty,“ he replied, “and on
his</p>
<p>own; that’s quite improper. He has no organization to back him up,
no</p>
<p>boss to bail him out when he gets into trouble. What’s worse, he
is</p>
<p>successful and thus sets a dangerous precedent.“ The point of the
story</p>
<p>is that the father-in-law was known all over Japan as the Red
Dean,</p>
<p>who delivered himself every Saturday evening on national radio of
a</p>
<p>violent philippic against the remnants of feudalism in Japanese
family</p>
<p>life and against the evils of the organization man.</p>
<p>Art history (or art anecdote) may provide the answer to the
paradox,</p>
<p>and a key to understanding the relationship between the rigid
commu-</p>
<p>nity of the ie and the spontaneity and individualism that
characterize so</p>
<p>much of Japanese art as well as of Japanese life and society.
Sakai</p>
<p>HGitsu (1761-1828), the last of the great Rimpa masters, started
out</p>
<p>studying under a Kan6 painter around 1790. He then became the
pupil</p>
<p>of a distinguished Nanga artist, Kushiro Unsen (1759-1 8 11). Next
he</p>
<p>apparently went for career advice to Tani Bunch6 (1764-1840), the</p>
<p>recognized Nanga master in the city of Edo, Japan’s political
capital.</p>
<p>Bunch6 did not tell the young HGitsu to stick to Nanga, but
counseled</p>
<p>him to study the works of Ogata K6rin (1663-1743) and to become a</p>
<p>Rimpa painter. A great teacher in the West might have said to such
a</p>
<p>highly gifted young man: “Find the style that fits you.“ Bunch6
said,</p>
<p>in effect: “Find the school that fits you.“</p>
<p>The tension between the pressure to belong and to conform and the</p>
<p>stress on spontaneity, independence, and individuality is one, but
only</p>
<p>A View of Japan through Japanese Art 367</p>
<p>one, of the polarities that characterize Japanese art and
Japanese</p>
<p>culture. A well-known Japanese art collection contains for
instance</p>
<p>hree works by famous seventeenth-century masters; Two Wagtails,</p>
<p>attributed to Kan6 Sanraku (1559-1635); Child Holding a Spray of</p>
<p>Flowers, attributed to Tarawaya Sdtatsu (early
seventeenth-century);</p>
<p>and a circular fan, Autumnal Ivy Leaves with Bamboo, by Ogata
Korin.</p>
<p>Each epitomizes the Japanese talent for simplicity refined to the
point</p>
<p>of austerity. Yet Sanraku’s best-known paintings, such as his
screens</p>
<p>of birds and trees and flowers, are ornate and sumptuous, with
gold</p>
<p>and silver and ostentatious colors. Sotatsu founded the
decorative</p>
<p>Rimpa School, with its strong lyricism and colorful elegance, and</p>
<p>Korin perfected it with his rich designs. Thus the three paintings in
this</p>
<p>one collection may be called atypical of their painter-and yet each
is</p>
<p>also completely typical of him.</p>
<p>In the same collection there is a landscape by the early
sixteenth-</p>
<p>century painter Kantei that simplifies and makes more austere the</p>
<p>already simplified and austere style of the fifteenth-century
Japanese</p>
<p>landscape painter. But there is also a pair of flower-and-bird
paintings</p>
<p>by the same master that is ornate, decorative, almost sumptuous.</p>
<p>Almost two hundred years later, in the early nineteenth century,</p>
<p>Watanabe Kazan, the most austere of Neo-Confucians, painted a
lush,</p>
<p>sensuous, colorful picture of Lotus Flowers and Swimming Fish.</p>
<p>To a Westerner these seem to be contradictions; to a Japanese
they</p>
<p>are polarities. A Westerner may feel that an artist should be
attracted</p>
<p>either to the austerity and empty space of a fifteenth-century
landscape</p>
<p>or to the colorful, decorative design of a Kantei flower-and-bird</p>
<p>painting or a Sanraku bird screen, but not to both. To the
Japanese,</p>
<p>however, these are necessary tensions, poles of expression within
the</p>
<p>same person.</p>
<p>Any visitor to Kyoto sees examples of these tensions within a few</p>
<p>miles of each other: Nijo Castle–omate, sensuous, boastful, the</p>
<p>official Kyoto residence of the military dictator, the Tokugawa
sho-</p>
<p>gun; and Katsura Villa-simple to the point of being austere,
exqui-</p>
<p>site, without ornaments, and totally disciplined, the summer villa of
an</p>
<p>imperial prince. Both were built within the same generation and by
the</p>
<p>same ruling class. And there is Nikk6, north of Tokyo, the great
seven-</p>
<p>eenth-century mausoleum of the first Tokugawa shdgun Ieyasu-the</p>
<p>“shogun“ of the movie of that name-with its extreme ornateness,</p>
<p>almost too much, even for Baroque tastes. But the same shogun, in
his</p>
<p>368 The Ecoiogical Vision</p>
<p>castle, lived in restrained austerity. To the Japanese, the two
belong</p>
<p>ogether. The tension is not one of opposites, but one of poles;
and</p>
<p>where there is a north pole there has to be a south pole.</p>
<p>This tension, this polarity, extends through all of Japanese
culture.</p>
<p>It is found in the tension between the official Confucian male
suprem-</p>
<p>acy, which dictates that in public the woman is invisible and
subser-</p>
<p>vient, and the reality of family life, where the woman holds the
power</p>
<p>and the purse strings, and where a recent prime minister could say
in</p>
<p>parliament: “I have no position on this measure yet; my
mother-in-law</p>
<p>has been sick and I could not get her guidance,“ to which the
opposi-</p>
<p>ion spokesman nodded, replying: “Please convey my wishes for a</p>
<p>speedy recovery to your respected mother-in-law. “</p>
<p>A similar polarity is found in the upbringing of children. Until
they</p>
<p>reach school age, children are indulged in a way that goes beyond
any</p>
<p>American permissiveness. Then they go to school, and on the first
day</p>
<p>here is discipline and the children are expected to behave-and
they</p>
<p>do. There is a remarkable tension between the genius of the
Japanese</p>
<p>language, in which everything focuses on human relationship, and
the</p>
<p>nature of Chinese ideographs, which are built up of representations
of</p>
<p>objects. The Japanese very early invented syllabaries in which
the</p>
<p>sounds of Japanese can easily be written. Every Japanese learns
the</p>
<p>wo national syllabaries in the elementary grades. But then the
sylla-</p>
<p>baries are used mainly as auxiliaries to Chinese ideographs. To
the</p>
<p>Japanese, the tension between the Japanese language and the
Chinese</p>
<p>ideograph is essential, no matter how heavy a burden it puts on
learn-</p>
<p>ing and literacy.</p>
<p>There are strict rules for proper behavior that tell every
Japanese</p>
<p>what form of address to use when talking to his aunt and to his
uncle’s</p>
<p>boss and to his cousin’s mistress. But there is also the
encouragement</p>
<p>of the eccentric, who is given almost infinite leeway. Sengai, the
last</p>
<p>and perhaps greatest of the “Zenga Expressionists“-he died in
1838,</p>
<p>aged almost ninety-for instance, was the most respected cleric,
abbot</p>
<p>of an ancient and most sacred temple; but at the age of eighty-five
he</p>
<p>was also a free spirit, who traveled around the country, often in
low</p>
<p>company, and liked to paint satirical frogs to look like the
Buddha,</p>
<p>circus riders, and balloon vendors at county fairs.</p>
<p>This polarity can be found today in Japanese industry and its
human</p>
<p>relations. To a Westerner, an organization can be either autocratic
or</p>
<p>A View of Japan through Japanese Art 369</p>
<p>democratic, but the Japanese organization is both. Surely no more</p>
<p>perfect example of the autocratic personality exists than the head of
a</p>
<p>big Japanese organization, whether government agency or business.</p>
<p>Yet decision making is by consensus and participation, and starts at
the</p>
<p>bottom rather than at the top. In every Japanese organization
from</p>
<p>ancient times to the present the word of the chief has been
absolute</p>
<p>law; the chief could order a retainer to commit suicide or to divorce
his</p>
<p>wife. And yet no chief could make one step without the consent of
his</p>
<p>retainers, and indeed without active participation of the clan elders
in</p>
<p>he decision. Similarly, today the top people in a company or a</p>
<p>government agency are obeyed without argument or reservation-and</p>
<p>yet every decision comes up from below and is an expression of a</p>
<p>general will. Every Japanese organization is in Western terms both
an</p>
<p>extreme of autocracy and an extreme of democratic participation.</p>
<p>The tension is not dialectic, and resolved in a higher synthesis,
nor</p>
<p>does one principle overcome the other. It is not the dualism of
the</p>
<p>Chinese yin and yang. The Japanese do not mix their principles
any</p>
<p>more than one mixes north pole and south pole. For the Japanese</p>
<p>ension is not contradiction or contrast or conflict-the tensions of
the</p>
<p>analytical mind. It is polarity-the tension of perception, of
configura-</p>
<p>ion, of existence. To understand Japanese art and Japanese life,
one</p>
<p>has to accept the polarity between the ornate and the austere;
between</p>
<p>male supremacy and female power; between spoiled, indulged brats</p>
<p>and disciplined scholars; between the Japanese language with its
in-</p>
<p>flected verbs and syllabary script and the complexities of the
Chinese</p>
<p>ideograph. Such polarities are essential to Japan and, to my
knowl-</p>
<p>edge, to Japan alone.</p>
<p>It is this tension, this polarity, that has made Japan throughout
its</p>
<p>history a country of contrasts, of sharp and sudden swings: from
wide-</p>
<p>open receptivity to foreign cultures and foreign commerce to
self-</p>
<p>imposed isolation, for instance, in the seventeenth century. But it
is</p>
<p>also this polarity that gives Japanese art, Japanese literature,
and</p>
<p>Japanese industry their dynamics and creativity.</p>
<p>A Westerner who has business in Japan-the professor who goes</p>
<p>here to lecture or the businessman who negotiates a contract-soon</p>
<p>becomes familiar with the phrase “Wareware Nihon-jin,“ which</p>
<p>means “We Japanese.“ But whenever it is used (and it is used all
the</p>
<p>ime), it conveys: “We Japanese are so different that you will
never</p>
<p>understand us.“ To understand what a Japanese friend or business</p>
<p>partner, or the student in the audience who gets up and asks a
question,</p>
<p>means when he starts out with Wareware Nihon-jin, one needs to
look</p>
<p>at Japanese landscape paintings. But where in the landscapes are
the</p>
<p>people-the Nihon-jin? Yet it is precisely their absence, or their</p>
<p>subordination to the land, that is the point. For Nihon-jin does not
just</p>
<p>mean Japanese. It means: “We who belong to the land of Japan.“
The</p>
<p>landscape painting is the soul of Japanese art because the
Japanese</p>
<p>landscape has formed the soul of Japan.</p>
<p>Some of the features of these landscape paintings the Japanese
took</p>
<p>from the Chinese-the bizarre rock formation of the eroded Chinese</p>
<p>karst limestone that can be seen in so many Japanese landscape</p>
<p>paintings is an example. But most of the features of these
landscapes</p>
<p>can be found in Japan; indeed, a Japanese friend of mine claims that
he</p>
<p>knows the valley, someplace near Gifu, that Gyokudo, the great</p>
<p>nineteenth-century landscape painter, so often painted in his
small</p>
<p>lyrical landscapes. The Japanese landscape looks like the landscape
of</p>
<p>he Japanese painters, as everyone knows who has traveled in the</p>
<p>Japanese countryside. And yet the Japanese landscape does not look
a</p>
<p>bit like the landscape of the Japanese landscape painter, nor does
any</p>
<p>landscape on earth. The landscape of the Japanese painter is a
spiritual</p>
<p>landscape, a landscape of the soul.</p>
<p>The Japanese feeling for this landscape is part of “Shinto.“ What</p>
<p>Shinto really means, probably no Westerner has ever been fully able
to</p>
<p>understand. It surely does not mean a religion in the Western sense;
it</p>
<p>became a religion only after 1867, when the Meiji Restoration
created</p>
<p>a monstrosity known as State Shinto because it felt it had to
emulate</p>
<p>he way religions are set up in the West. Far more ancient and</p>
<p>pervasive are the many Shinto shrines and rituals, but there is,
above</p>
<p>all, a Shinto feeling-the feeling of the uniqueness of Japan as
an</p>
<p>environment. I did not write human environment; it is far more
than</p>
<p>hat. It is an environment fully as much for the supernatural, for
the</p>
<p>forces that control the universe, as it is an environment for man
and</p>
<p>beast, plant and rock. It is unique and it is complete. And it is</p>
<p>different, which is the point of Wareware Nihon-jin. Underlying
the</p>
<p>phrase is the feeling that Japan is unique; that Japan is by itself.
What</p>
<p>his means is expressed in the landscape paintings. Their hills and
trees</p>
<p>A View of Japan through Japanese Art 371</p>
<p>are the visible surface, the skin, of a spiritual landscape that is
invisible</p>
<p>and unique. There may be landscapes elsewhere that look like it.</p>
<p>Taiwan has similar hills, and so does Korea. But there is no
landscape,</p>
<p>o a Japanese, that means the same thing. A painting of the
Japanese</p>
<p>landscape can be a realistic image that serves as a valid legal
document</p>
<p>o determine the boundary lines of a Shinto shrine, as some of the</p>
<p>earliest Japanese landscape paintings were intended to do; but
even</p>
<p>hen it also means an inner space, a landscape of the soul that is
the</p>
<p>center of gravity of Japanese existence. This landscape is, so to
speak,</p>
<p>Japan a n sich.</p>
<p>I am not saying that the Japanese are, in fact, unique; I am
saying</p>
<p>hat the Japanese feel that they are. It is not that they feel
superior;</p>
<p>nationalism has been a Japanese vice only in rare, short moments
of</p>
<p>aberration. They feel different because they feel at home only in
this</p>
<p>landscape of their soul. This may explain why, of all the foreign</p>
<p>students in the United States and Europe, the Japanese are the
only</p>
<p>ones, who, with few exceptions, cannot wait to go back home.</p>
<p>I now come to what I would call “Japanese aesthetics,“ or the</p>
<p>“topological approach,“ or “What makes the Chinese so uneasy when</p>
<p>hey look at a Japanese painting?“</p>
<p>Almost any Japanese landscape painting could be used to demon-</p>
<p>strate Japanese aesthetics. The fifteenth-century paintings
deliberately</p>
<p>set out to follow the Chinese; and so did the Nanga painters of
the</p>
<p>eighteenth century. And yet, put a Chinese connoisseur or a
Chinese</p>
<p>art historian in front of these painters’ works and he will be
uneasy.</p>
<p>“Yes, these hills look like so-and-so in China. And yes, this
rock</p>
<p>looks like some other painter in China. And the brushwork is this
or</p>
<p>hat school. And the brush technique, of course, follows another</p>
<p>Chinese example. And yet, and yet, and yet . . .“ What he is
saying,</p>
<p>if he is candid, is: “And yet these are definitely not Chinese
paintings.</p>
<p>They make me very uneasy and I do not understand why. But I do
not</p>
<p>want to have them around. “</p>
<p>One only has to put these works next to Chinese paintings to
under-</p>
<p>stand his feelings. I am not saying that one cannot mistake a
Chinese</p>
<p>painting for a Japanese one, and vice versa. The technique is the
same,</p>
<p>he brushstrokes are the same, the ink values are the same-and the</p>
<p>painting is different. What makes it different is the Japanese sense
of</p>
<p>beauty. The Japanese paintings are dominated by empty space. It is
not</p>
<p>only that so much of the canvas is empty. The empty space
organizes</p>
<p>he painting. This is the opposite to what most Chinese would do, but
it</p>
<p>is basic to Japanese aesthetics. The same aesthetics are found in</p>
<p>Japanese paintings of all schools, and in the works of painters
who</p>
<p>followed the Chinese as well as in the works of painters who
rejected</p>
<p>he Chinese.</p>
<p>If I were to define these aesthetics in contrast to those in
Western</p>
<p>and Chinese painting, I would say that Western painting is
basically</p>
<p>geometric. It is no coincidence that modern Western painting
begins</p>
<p>with the rediscovery of linear perspective, around 1425, that is,
with</p>
<p>he subordination of space to geometry. Chinese painting, on the
other</p>
<p>hand, is algebraic. In Chinese painting, proportion governs, as it
does</p>
<p>in Chinese ethics. Japanese painting is by contrast
topological-that</p>
<p>branch of mathematics that began around 1700 and that deals with
the</p>
<p>properties of surface and space in which shapes and lines are
defined</p>
<p>by space, so that there is no difference between a straight line and
a</p>
<p>curve, such as a hyperbola. Topology deals with angles and
vortices</p>
<p>and boundary lines. It deals with what space imposes rather than
with</p>
<p>what is imposed on space. The Japanese painter is topological in
his</p>
<p>aesthetics. He sees space and then he sees lines. He does not start
out</p>
<p>with the lines.</p>
<p>It has been commonplace for Western art critics and art
historians</p>
<p>for almost a hundred years to say that painters do not see objects
but</p>
<p>configurations. But the Gestalt that the Japanese painter sees is
what</p>
<p>we today would call a design rather than a structure. This is what
the</p>
<p>opologist means when he says that, topologically speaking, it is
space</p>
<p>hat determines the line rather than the line that determines space.
In</p>
<p>discussions of Japanese painting, one usually finds a reference to
the</p>
<p>Japanese tendency to become “decorative.“ The Nanga painters of
the</p>
<p>eighteenth century abhorred the decorative as totally incompatible
with</p>
<p>he values and aesthetics of their Chinese literati models; and yet,
as</p>
<p>we are told by all authorities, they always became decorative. Like
so</p>
<p>many words in art criticism, “decorative“ is misleading; the
right</p>
<p>word might be “designed.“ And this irrepressible tendency toward</p>
<p>design-the tendency that explains why ceramics, lacquer, and
paint-</p>
<p>ing in Japanese art tend to be closely allied, while the Chinese
kept</p>
<p>hem strictly separate artistically and socially-is based on a
Japanese</p>
<p>A View of Japan through Japanese Art 373</p>
<p>vision that is neither perspectival (i.e., geometric) nor
proportional</p>
<p>(i.e., algebraic), but topological in design.</p>
<p>Both the fifteenth-century black-ink painters and the eighteenth-</p>
<p>century Nanga painters looked to the Chinese as models and
masters.</p>
<p>Both learned techniques from the Chinese, but also motives and
style</p>
<p>and form. But both transmuted Chinese algebra into Japanese
topol-</p>
<p>ogy. This ability to receive a foreign culture and then to “Japanize“
it</p>
<p>is a continuing thread in Japanese history and experience.</p>
<p>Around A.D. 500, Buddhism, and with it the highly advanced and</p>
<p>most refined civilization of China, swept into Japan. At first the
impact</p>
<p>seemed to inundate Japan completely. Everything was brought from</p>
<p>China or Korea, including monks and architects and artists and
artisans</p>
<p>and scribes and poetry and artworks and textiles. After only two</p>
<p>centuries, by the Nara period, Japan was producing religious
sculpture</p>
<p>hat was completely Buddhist and yet deeply Japanese, even though</p>
<p>he techniques were still those of the Chinese and Korean
sculptors.</p>
<p>But Japan equally transmuted China’s governmental and social
struc-</p>
<p>ures. It made both Buddhism and Confucianism serve a tribal, and</p>
<p>soon thereafter, a warrior society. It made Chinese concepts of
land</p>
<p>enure, grounded in family ownership of soil, serve a system in
which</p>
<p>here was no ownership of land at all, except by temples and the</p>
<p>hrone. There were only graduated rights to the product of the
land-</p>
<p>hat is, graduated rights to tax and tribute rather than ownership
rights</p>
<p>in land as such. The same thing happened in ceramics, in poetry,
and</p>
<p>in architecture.</p>
<p>It is happening again today; only now it is the West rather than</p>
<p>China that is the foreign culture that is being Japanized. Forms,</p>
<p>echniques, and concepts are used very skillfully. As the
fifteenth-</p>
<p>century and the eighteenth-century painters did, the Japanese
rapidly</p>
<p>improve on the techniques. There are few Chinese painters whose</p>
<p>control and command of the brush equal the artistry of the great</p>
<p>fifteenth-century Japanese landscape painter Sesshu. There are
few</p>
<p>Western companies that have the control and command of the corpo-</p>
<p>rate form and of managerial techniques that the large Japanese
trading</p>
<p>companies possess. But the essence is Japanese. The Japanese are
not</p>
<p>unaffected by the foreign influence; it becomes part of their own</p>
<p>experience. Yet they distill out of the foreign influence
whatever</p>
<p>serves to maintain and strengthen Japanese values, beliefs,
traditions,</p>
<p>purposes, relationships. The result is not a hybrid. It is, as
the</p>
<p>fifteenth-century paintings or the eighteenth-century paintings
show,</p>
<p>all of one piece. This is a truly unique Japanese characteristic.</p>
<p>Again and again, Japanese society has lived through periods when
it</p>
<p>was wide open to foreign influences. But then it closes in again,
to</p>
<p>digest, transmute, and transform almost alchemically. What is
consid-</p>
<p>ered base metal in the foreign culture sometimes becomes gold in</p>
<p>Japan, as with the Chinese thirteenth-century painters Mu-ch’i or
Yin</p>
<p>T’o-lo. Both were rejected by the Chinese as “coarse“ or
“vulgar.“</p>
<p>They then became the models and masters for the most austerely</p>
<p>refined Japanese painters of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
But</p>
<p>sometimes the metal in a foreign culture may become dross in
Japan,</p>
<p>as happened in this century to the idea of the national state,
imported</p>
<p>from the West and transmuted into a poisonous parody of an old
and</p>
<p>peculiarly Japanese political form, the shGgunate, or military
govern-</p>
<p>ment. Always before the shogun had served to eliminate fighting,
to</p>
<p>make war both unnecessary and impossible, and, above all, to
prevent</p>
<p>foreign adventure.</p>
<p>The Japanese aesthetics are a way to understand, or at least to</p>
<p>perceive, a fundamental and central element: the very special (I
would</p>
<p>say unique) relationship between Japan and the outside world. It is
a</p>
<p>relationship based on receptivity, on an ability to learn quickly and
to</p>
<p>improve on what is being taught, while at the same time accepting,
or</p>
<p>at least retaining, only what makes Japan more Japanese: what
fits</p>
<p>opology rather than geometry or algebra; what fits Japanese human</p>
<p>relations; what fits the inner experience of the uniqueness of
Japan,</p>
<p>and what might be called, with a Western term, Japanese
spirituality.</p>
<p>We are talking here of an existential phenomenon; and by the way,
the</p>
<p>best translation of the peculiar word “Shinto“ is probably
spirituality.</p>
<p>Whether it can maintain these abilities is the great question ahead
of</p>
<p>Japan, I think. Japan is now becoming integrated into the outside
world,</p>
<p>and not just economically (perhaps least of all economically) in a
way</p>
<p>which neither the Japan of the sixth century, that of the Buddhist
and</p>
<p>Chinese tidal wave, nor the Japan of Sesshii’s time around 1500,
nor</p>
<p>perhaps even the Japan of a hundred years ago, could have
imagined.</p>
<p>Is it still possible for Japan to encapsulate and transmute into
Japanese</p>
<p>he foreign, the non-Japanese, culture, behavior, ethics, and even</p>
<p>aesthetics?</p>
<p>A View of Japan through Japanese Art 375</p>
<p>I dare not even speculate-but there are a few straws in the wind.
If</p>
<p>one looks at the visual arts that today prosper in Japan-the
modem</p>
<p>Japanese woodblock print; the Japanese movie; modem Japanese ce-</p>
<p>ramics; and perhaps one could add Japanese architecture-one would</p>
<p>say that there is a possibility, even a probability, that the
Japanese are</p>
<p>again Japanizing the imported culture. The Japanese woodblock
print</p>
<p>is modem and Japanese very much in the way in which Nara
sculpture</p>
<p>was Buddhist and Japanese. So too, to a large extent, are the
ceramics</p>
<p>of Japan today. I can hope only that the Japanese will do again
what</p>
<p>hey have done before so many times. The world needs a culture that
is</p>
<p>both modern and distinctly, uniquely, non-Western. It needs a
Japa-</p>
<p>nese Japan rather than a Japanese version of New York or Los
Angeles</p>
<p>or Frankfurt.</p>
<p>“Ten minutes and eighty years,“ Hakuin Ekaku, the great
eighteenth-</p>
<p>century Zen master, is said to have answered when asked how long
it</p>
<p>ook him to paint one of his paintings of Daruma, the founder of
the</p>
<p>Zen sect. Of course, Rembrandt might have given the same answer</p>
<p>when asked how long it took him to paint the self-portraits of his
old</p>
<p>age, Claude Monet when asked how long it took him to paint one of</p>
<p>he hymns to light in his versions of Rouen Cathedral, or Pablo
Casals</p>
<p>when asked how long it took him to play one of Bach’s “Unaccom-</p>
<p>panied Suites for Cello.“ But Hakuin’s answer has two levels of</p>
<p>meaning beyond that of the Western artist: it expresses a Japanese
view</p>
<p>of the nature of man, and a Japanese view of the nature of
learning.</p>
<p>These may be seen in the one dimension in Japanese figure and</p>
<p>portrait painting for which the West has no real parallel, nor
China</p>
<p>either-the spiritual self-portrait. If the Westerner says that it
takes</p>
<p>eighty years to be able to do what Rembrandt’s last
self-portraits</p>
<p>represent, or Monet’s pure light and Casals’ Bach, he talks of
the</p>
<p>decades of practice needed to attain the skill. But the “eighty
years“</p>
<p>of the Japanese saying refer, above all, to the spiritual
self-realization</p>
<p>needed to become the person who can paint Daruma. An old Zen</p>
<p>saying has it that “Every painting of Daruma is a [spiritual]
self-</p>
<p>portrait.“ The Zen painter who has not worked for decades on
control</p>
<p>of the self will not be the person to paint Daruma. Daruma is not a
god,</p>
<p>he is not a saint. He is man, but one who has realized man’s full</p>
<p>spiritual potential, who has attained man’s full spiritual power,
and</p>
<p>who has transformed himself into a spiritual being. And only the</p>
<p>painter who has himself become the spiritual man which Daruma</p>
<p>represents can then paint a portrait on which he can inscribe, as
Hakuin</p>
<p>did on one of his Darumas, “This Is IT!“ The spiritual power, the</p>
<p>spiritual qualities of Daruma cannot be faked. No matter how great
a</p>
<p>painter’s skill, if he lacks these qualities, his Daruma will lack
them</p>
<p>oo.</p>
<p>Kan6 Tanyii, in the mid-seventeenth century, and Rosetsu, a
centu-</p>
<p>ry later, very great masters and without peers in painting skill,
both</p>
<p>painted Daruma. Tanyii’s Daruma looks like an elderly bureaucrat
or</p>
<p>successful banker; Rosetsu’s like the urbane and witting chairman of
a</p>
<p>university graduate department. Both are excellent paintings-but
nei-</p>
<p>her has spirituality, power, total compelling control. But the
Daruma</p>
<p>by a painter who himself has the spirituality will have that power
even</p>
<p>if, as in the case of a Daruma painted by Hakuin in his extreme
old</p>
<p>age, the body is weighed down by the physical infirmity of
advanced</p>
<p>old age, the eyes are almost blind despite heavy glasses, the legs
have</p>
<p>given out, and death is very near.</p>
<p>Daruma is mortal. He is a sentient being. But unlike the saints
of</p>
<p>Christianity or of Buddhism, he is not dependent on divine grace, on
a</p>
<p>Supreme Being, or on redemption. He had attained spiritual
perfection</p>
<p>hrough his own efforts and by fulfilling the divinity within him.
This</p>
<p>is not a “humanist“ view of man but a spiritual and existential one.
It</p>
<p>is a view that focuses on wisdom rather than on knowledge; on
self-</p>
<p>control rather than on power; on excellence rather than on
success.</p>
<p>The Zen saying of “ten minutes and eighty years“ also expresses a</p>
<p>uniquely Japanese concept of continuous learning. In the West and
in</p>
<p>China, one learns to prepare oneself for the next job, for a
promotion,</p>
<p>for a new challenge. The most extreme example was the Confucian</p>
<p>examination system of Imperial China, where one actually had to</p>
<p>unlearn what the first examination tested to get ready for the next,
the</p>
<p>second one. The Western modem medical school is not too different</p>
<p>either, nor are most Advanced Management courses. But in Zen, one</p>
<p>learns so as to do better what one already does well. One keeps
on</p>
<p>painting Daruma until the control becomes completely spontaneous.</p>
<p>One draws, as did the early seventeenth-century calligrapher
Konoe</p>
<p>Nobutada, a picture of Tenjin, the patron of learning, every
morning-</p>
<p>he same picture, but with ever-increasing mastery. Or, like Na-</p>
<p>A View of Japan through Japanese Art 377</p>
<p>kabayashi Chikut6, around 1800, one paints the same landscapes
over</p>
<p>and over again. Of course, in the West the artist does that
too-Casals</p>
<p>practiced the Bach cello suites until his death, well past ninety
years of</p>
<p>age. But in the West-and in China–only the artist does this; the
rest</p>
<p>of us are like Confucian scholars who pass one examination to be</p>
<p>qualified to sit for the next, and for whom one promotion is the</p>
<p>stepping stone to the next.</p>
<p>In Japan there is to this day the specialist in the trading company,
the</p>
<p>specialist on cotton, for instance, or on woodworking machinery,
who</p>
<p>gets more money and a bigger title but stays the specialist on cotton
or</p>
<p>on woodworking machinery all his working life, becoming more</p>
<p>accomplished with every year. There is the continuous learning
pro-</p>
<p>cess in the Japanese factory, where employees get more money with</p>
<p>seniority but keep on doing the same job, and meet every week to</p>
<p>discuss how they can do their present jobs better. And there is
the</p>
<p>uniquely Japanese concept of the Living National Treasure, the
great</p>
<p>craftsman or artist who has excelled through doing the same work.
The</p>
<p>Western theory of the learning curve is not accepted in Japan-the</p>
<p>heory that people reach a plateau of accomplishment after a
certain</p>
<p>ime and then stay on it. The Japanese learning curve has them
break</p>
<p>out of that plateau again by continuing to practice-until they reach
a</p>
<p>new plateau, when they again, after a time, start learning and
growing,</p>
<p>and so on, always approaching perfection. The Japanese learning</p>
<p>curve, like the Zen master’s ten minutes and eighty years, sees
learn-</p>
<p>ing as an act of spiritual perfection and personal self-development
as</p>
<p>much as an acquisition of skills. It is a way of changing the person,
and</p>
<p>not just a way of acquiring performance capacity.</p>
<p>Again this is but one strand. Japanese history and Japanese
society</p>
<p>are as full of climbers, of ambitious schemers, of people on the
make</p>
<p>and people on the take, as any other history or society. But there is
also</p>
<p>he counterpoint-the ten minutes and eighty years of continuous</p>
<p>learning to do better what one already does very well.</p>
<p>The Japanese or Zen concept of learning is not without dangers.
It</p>
<p>can degenerate into imitation and repetition. This is what happened
to</p>
<p>he Kan6 School of painting. It was Japan’s “official“ art for
almost</p>
<p>hree hundred years, from the mid-sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth</p>
<p>century. It maintained itself in this position by insistence on
continu-</p>
<p>ous learning, on meticulous technique, on close adherence to the</p>
<p>models. Thus it retained its technical competence. But it also,
after</p>
<p>1650 or so, rapidly degenerated into mechanical copying. And it
was</p>
<p>still at mechanical copying when the Meiji Restoration opened Japan
to</p>
<p>he West more than two centuries later. But though capable of
degener-</p>
<p>ating into mechanical copying and mindless repetition, the Zen
tradi-</p>
<p>ion is closer to being a genuine theory of learning than the
Western</p>
<p>and Chinese concept of learning for the sake of advancement,
promo-</p>
<p>ion, or moving on. With its focus on developing the strengths of
a</p>
<p>person, it anticipated by hundreds of years modern theories of
the</p>
<p>person and of self-realization. There is indeed profound wisdom in
the</p>
<p>insight that work is an extension of personality and personality
a</p>
<p>distillation of work, so that one cannot paint Daruma’s spiritual
quali-</p>
<p>ies without having them oneself, but so that one also becomes
Daruma</p>
<p>by painting him every day for decades.</p>
<p>The insight and wisdom that lie in the Zen conception of the
person</p>
<p>and of learning are endangered in today’s Japan. The Japanese
educa-</p>
<p>ional system has opted for an extreme of the Western and
Confucian</p>
<p>position, which sees the purpose of learning as getting ready for
the</p>
<p>next examination, the next promotion, the next external reward.
In-</p>
<p>fants are drilled to pass the entrance examination to the right
nursery</p>
<p>school, so as to be admitted to the entrance examination to the
right</p>
<p>kindergarten, which in turn leads to the entrance examination to
the</p>
<p>right elementary school, and on to high school, the university, and
the</p>
<p>corporation. Is there still room for the emphasis on learning to
become,</p>
<p>on learning to be, on learning to say, “This is IT!“ when
painting</p>
<p>Daruma as a spiritual portrait?</p>
<p>I have so far used Japanese painting to look at Japan. Now I
shall</p>
<p>use–or abuse-Japanese painting to look at the West and at Western</p>
<p>modem art. Rosetsu painted The Temple Bell at DOjO-ji in the
1780s.</p>
<p>The title refers to a well-known Kabuki play. But the painting itself
is</p>
<p>virtually abstract and non-objective. Yet it was painted a century
and a</p>
<p>half before there were abstract painters in the West. It is by no
means</p>
<p>Japan’s oldest abstract painting; in fact, such paintings can be
traced</p>
<p>back to the Heian period of the tenth century. Tani Bunchii, the
great</p>
<p>master-painter in Ed-today’s Tokyo-painted a Flowering Plum</p>
<p>Tree in the Moonlight shortly after 1800. It anticipates what Turner
or</p>
<p>A View of Japan through Japanese Art 379</p>
<p>Monet tried to do half a century later in the West: to make light
the</p>
<p>subject of a painting. A Hakuin Daruma is an expressionist
painting,</p>
<p>like those of Klimt, Schiele, and Kubin, and Picasso in his
expression-</p>
<p>ist years, and Matisse; but with a power very few of them had.
Mod-</p>
<p>ernism in Western art is thus anticipated by Japanese tradition.
There is</p>
<p>a story-perhaps apocryphal-that Picasso was taken in 1953 through</p>
<p>an exhibition in Paris of Japanese paintings that featured the works
of</p>
<p>he Zen priest and painter Gibon Sengai, who had died in 1838, and</p>
<p>hat he stormed out of the exhibition exclaiming furiously that it was
a</p>
<p>hoax since no one could possibly have painted like this without
first</p>
<p>having seen his, Picasso’s work. Modernism in Western art is in
fact</p>
<p>anticipated, if not prefigured, by the Japanese tradition.</p>
<p>Yet, of course, Westerners had never laid eyes on the Japanese</p>
<p>originals or even heard of them. Other than ukiyo-e, the
woodblock</p>
<p>prints, Japanese art was virtually unknown in the West until
fairly</p>
<p>recent years. The West, in other words, has developed within the
last</p>
<p>century elements of a modern vision and sensibility that were
ancient</p>
<p>in Japan. The West has learned to see in somewhat the same way
that</p>
<p>he Japanese have seen all along. The West has shifted from
descrip-</p>
<p>ion and analysis to design and configuration.</p>
<p>Marshall McLuhan has announced that the electronic media have</p>
<p>changed our ways of seeing and interpreting the world, and are
making</p>
<p>us perceive rather than conceive. But a view of Western perception
as</p>
<p>informed by an understanding of Japanese art would lead to the
conclu-</p>
<p>sion that this shift began much earlier and owed nothing to
electronic</p>
<p>echnology. On the contrary, it would appear more probable that
the</p>
<p>West became ready for the electronic technology and receptive to
it</p>
<p>because its perception had shifted from traditional description
and</p>
<p>analysis to the perception of design and configuration that Japan
had</p>
<p>known all along.</p>
<p>A distinguished historian of modern Western painting, Robert</p>
<p>Rosenblum, in his Modern Painting and the Northern Romantic
Tradi-</p>
<p>ion: Friedrich to Rothko, asserts that modern Western painting has
its</p>
<p>roots in the northern, mostly North German, painters of the
nineteenth</p>
<p>century-Caspar David Friedrich and Otto Runge-who shifted from</p>
<p>description to design. But this, it could be argued, is precisely
what</p>
<p>had occurred in Japan far earlier: perception as against
conception,</p>
<p>design as against description, topology as against geometry, and
con-</p>
<p>figuration as against analysis, have indeed been continuing
characteris-</p>
<p>ics of Japanese art from the tenth century on.</p>
<p>Edwin 0 . Reischauer, the former American ambassador to Japan</p>
<p>and the foremost authority on Japanese history and society, wrote
in</p>
<p>his book, The Japanese, that Japan has never produced a great or</p>
<p>original thinker of the first rank. This has been read as severe
criticism,</p>
<p>especially in Japan; but Reischauer’s point was that Japan’s genius
is</p>
<p>perceptual rather than conceptual.</p>
<p>The towering achievement of the high Middle Ages in the West was</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas’ Summa Theologica, perhaps the boldest conceptual</p>
<p>and analytical feat in human history. The proudest achievement of</p>
<p>Japan’s “Middle Ages, “ the eleventh century, is the world’s
first</p>
<p>novel, Lady Murasaki Shikibu’s Tale of Genji, filled with
intimate</p>
<p>descriptions of men and women in court life, of love and illness
and</p>
<p>death. Japan’s greatest playwright, Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1643-</p>
<p>1724), had neither camera nor screen, but his Kabuki and Bunraku</p>
<p>(puppet) plays are highly cinematic. They are song, dance,
costumes,</p>
<p>and music, as well as the spoken word. The characters are defined
not</p>
<p>so much by what they say as by how they appear. People rarely quote
a</p>
<p>line that Chikamatsu wrote. Yet no one ever forgets a scene.
Chika-</p>
<p>matsu was not a dramatist but a scriptwriter of genius. And
without</p>
<p>benefit of cinematic tools, his Kabuki theater invented cinema
tech-</p>
<p>niques; the mie in which the actors freeze, is, for instance, the
equiva-</p>
<p>lent of the movie close-up.</p>
<p>The perceptual in Japanese tradition largely underlies Japan’s rise
as</p>
<p>a modem society and economy. It enabled the Japanese to grasp the</p>
<p>essence, the fundamental configuration of things foreign and
Western,</p>
<p>whether an institution or a product, and then to redesign. The
most</p>
<p>important thing that can be said about Japan as viewed through its
art</p>
<p>may well be that Japan is perceptual.</p>
