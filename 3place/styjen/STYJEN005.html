<h4 id="henry-ford-the-last-populist">Henry Ford: The Last Populist</h4>
<p>Henry Ford’s hold on America’s imagination-indeed, on the imag-</p>
<p>ination of the world’s masses-was not due to his fabulous
financial</p>
<p>success. And it can only partly be explained by the overwhelming</p>
<p>impact of the automobile on our way of life. For Henry Ford was
less</p>
<p>he symbol and embodiment of new wealth and of the automobile age</p>
<p>han the symbol and embodiment of our new industrial mass-pro-</p>
<p>duction civilization.</p>
<p>He perfectly represented its success in technology and economics;</p>
<p>he also perfectly represented its political failure so far-its
failure to</p>
<p>build an industrial order, an industrial society. The central problem
of</p>
<p>our age is defined in the contrast between the functional grandeur
of</p>
<p>he River Rouge plant, with its spotless mechanical perfection, and
the</p>
<p>formlessness and tension of the social jungle that is Detroit. And
the</p>
<p>wo together comprise Henry Ford’s legacy.</p>
<p>Both his success and his failure can be traced to his being
thoroughly</p>
<p>representative of that most native and most dominant of all
American</p>
<p>raditions, the one which in populism found its major political
expres-</p>
<p>sion. Indeed, Henry Ford was both the last populist and perhaps
the</p>
<p>greatest one. He owed all his basic convictions to Bryan:
pacifism,</p>
<p>isolationism, hatred of monopoly and of “Wall Street“ and of
“inter-</p>
<p>national bankers,“ firm belief in a sinister international
conspiracy,</p>
<p>and so forth. He also made true the great dream of the political</p>
<p>First published in Harper’s Magazine, 1947, shortly after Ford’s
death.</p>
<p>crusaders of 1896: that industrial production might be made to
serve</p>
<p>he common man. This dream had obsessed the American people since</p>
<p>Brook Farm and Robert Owen’s New Harmony, half a century before</p>
<p>Bryan.</p>
<p>The populists had believed that a Jeffersonian millennium would</p>
<p>result automatically from eliminating “monopoly“ and the “money</p>
<p>power“ and the “satanic mills’’ of crude industrialism-as these
terms</p>
<p>were understood in the nineteenth century. Ford fulfilled the
dream.</p>
<p>He succeeded without benefit of monopoly; he defied the big
bankers;</p>
<p>he gave his factories a clean and airy efficiency which would
have</p>
<p>delighted nineteenth-century reformers. But in fulfilling the dream
he</p>
<p>dispelled it. And in the place of the old enemies which he
vanquished,</p>
<p>we have today, in the industrial system which Ford did so much to</p>
<p>develop, new problems to face: the long-term depression, and the</p>
<p>political and social problems of industrial citizenship in the big
plant.</p>
<p>Henry Ford’s solution of the industrial problems with which the
nine-</p>
<p>eenth century had wrestled unsuccessfully constituted his success,
his</p>
<p>achievement. His inability to solve the problems of the new
industrial</p>
<p>system, his inability to see even that there were such problems, was
the</p>
<p>measure of his final and tragic failure.</p>
<p>It may seem paradoxical to interpret Henry Ford’s importance in
terms</p>
<p>of a concept–especially a political concept such as populism. He</p>
<p>himself had nothing but contempt for concepts and ideas and
prided</p>
<p>himself on being neither a theoretician nor a politician, but a
“practical</p>
<p>man.“ And the main criticism which has been leveled against him
and</p>
<p>against everything he stood for-the criticism embodied in, for
in-</p>
<p>stance, Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times-has been that he made</p>
<p>mechanical perfection an end in itself. But even his contribution
to</p>
<p>echnology was not really a technical but a conceptual one-superb</p>
<p>production man and engineer though he was. For he invented
nothing,</p>
<p>no new technique, no new machine, not even a new gadget. What he</p>
<p>supplied was the idea of mass production itself: organization of
men,</p>
<p>machines, and materials into one productive whole.</p>
<p>In economics, too, Ford discovered no new facts; the data showing</p>
<p>he effect of volume production on costs had all been collected
and</p>
<p>analyzed. But Ford was the first manufacturer to understand that
these</p>
<p>data disproved the traditional theory that restricted production and
a</p>
<p>high profit margin-that is, monopoly-provided the most profitable</p>
<p>Henry Ford: The Last Populist 35</p>
<p>form of industrial production. He demonstrated that one could
raise</p>
<p>wages, cut prices, produce in tremendous volume, and still make</p>
<p>millions.</p>
<p>Above all, Ford himself regarded his technical and economic</p>
<p>achievements primarily as means to a social end. He had a
definite</p>
<p>political and social philosophy to which he adhered to the point
of</p>
<p>doctrinaire absurdity. Concern with the social effects of his
actions</p>
<p>determined every one of his steps and decisions throughout his
entire</p>
<p>life. It underlay the break with his early partners who wanted to</p>
<p>produce a luxury car for the rich rather than follow Ford’s
harebrained</p>
<p>idea of a cheap utility car for the masses. It motivated the radical
wage</p>
<p>policy of the early Ford who in 1914 fixed his minimum wage at
the</p>
<p>hen utopian figure of .00 a day for unskilled labor. It showed in</p>
<p>Ford’s lifelong militant pacifism, of which the tragicomic Peace
Ship</p>
<p>episode of 1915-1916 was only one manifestation. It showed in his</p>
<p>isolationism, in his hostility to Wall Street, and in the raucous
Pam-</p>
<p>phleteering of the Dearborn Independent in the twenties. This
social</p>
<p>philosophy explains the millions he poured into “chemurgy“ or
into</p>
<p>utopian village communities of self-sufficient, sturdy, yeoman
farm-</p>
<p>ers. It was responsible for his belief in decentralization and for
his</p>
<p>nostalgic attempt to recreate the atmosphere of an earlier and
simpler</p>
<p>America in a museum community-right next door to the River Rouge</p>
<p>plant.</p>
<p>It might almost be said that Henry Ford’s lifework, despite these</p>
<p>moves of his, brought about the opposite kind of world from the one
he</p>
<p>hoped for and believed in. Thus Ford, the pacifist, built up one of
the</p>
<p>world’s greatest armament plants and helped to make possible the</p>
<p>mechanized warfare of our age. Ford, the isolationist, more than
any</p>
<p>other man has made it impossible for this country to stay out of</p>
<p>international politics and international wars: for he made this
country</p>
<p>he most powerful industrial nation on earth. Ford, the agrarian
decen-</p>
<p>ralist, left as his life’s work the River Rouge plant, the most
highly</p>
<p>centralized and most completely mechanized concentration of
indus-</p>
<p>rial power in the world. The enemy of finance capital and bank
credit,</p>
<p>he made installment buying a national habit. An orthodox
Jefferson-</p>
<p>ian, he has come to stand for the extreme application of the
assembly-</p>
<p>line principle, with its subordination of the individual to the
machine.</p>
<p>And the very workers at the Ford Motor Company, whose mass</p>
<p>production was to give economic security and full industrial
citizen-</p>
<p>ship to all, organized before his death the most class-conscious
union</p>
<p>in America-and a Communist-dominated local at that.</p>
<p>Yet it would be wrong to argue from the failure of Ford’s social</p>
<p>ideas that they never were anything but “eccentric hobbies,“ as
the</p>
<p>obituaries rather condescendingly called them. The tragic irony
with</p>
<p>which his every move turned against him in the end does not alter
the</p>
<p>fact that his was the first, and so far the only, systematic attempt
to</p>
<p>solve the social and political problems of an industrial
civilization.</p>
<p>There is also little doubt that Ford himself believed4ertainly
until</p>
<p>1941 when the Ford workers voted for the CIO, and perhaps even</p>
<p>afterward-that he had actually found the answer for which the
Ameri-</p>
<p>can people had been searching for almost a century: the realization
of</p>
<p>he Jeffersonian society of independent equals through industrial
tech-</p>
<p>nology and economic abundance.</p>
<p>Nor was he alone in this appraisal of the meaning of his work. It
was</p>
<p>shared by the American people as a whole in the years immediately</p>
<p>following World War I; witness Wilson’s urging in 1918 that Ford
run</p>
<p>for the Senate and the powerful “Ford for President“ boom of
1923.</p>
<p>The view was also held abroad, especially in the Europe of the
early</p>
<p>wenties and in Lenin’s Russia-perhaps even more generally there</p>
<p>han here. Indeed, it was the performance of Henry Ford’s America</p>
<p>which in 1918 and 1919 gave substance to Wilson’s promise of the</p>
<p>millennium of peace, democracy, and abundance and which estab-</p>
<p>lished America’s moral and political authority in those years. And
the</p>
<p>Ford spell remained potent long after Wilson’s promise had faded</p>
<p>under the cold light of the international realities of the 1920s.</p>
<p>The world of Ford’s death, the world after World War 11, was at</p>
<p>least as much under the spell of Frankin D. Roosevelt’s name as
an</p>
<p>earlier generation had been under that of Wilson. But Henry Ford
in</p>
<p>1946 no longer symbolized an America that had successfully solved</p>
<p>he basic social problems of an industrial world. He stood instead</p>
<p>for the lack of a solution. And that surely accounted in large
measure</p>
<p>for the difference between 1919 and 1947 in the acceptance and
the</p>
<p>effectiveness of America’s moral and economic leadership.</p>
<p>Henry Ford took the conveyor belt and the assembly line from the</p>
<p>meat-packing industry, where they had been in general use as early
as</p>
<p>Henry Ford: The Last Populist 37</p>
<ol start="1880" type="1">
<li>The interchangeability of precision-made parts was an even</li>
</ol>
<p>older principle; it went back to the rifle plant which Eli Whitney
built</p>
<p>in Bridgeport for the War of 1812. The idea of breaking down a
skilled</p>
<p>job into the constituent elementary motions, so that it could be
per-</p>
<p>formed by unskilled men working in series, had been thoroughly</p>
<p>explored-by Taylor among others-and had been widely used in</p>
<p>American industry twenty years before Ford came on the scene, as,
for</p>
<p>example, by Singer Sewing Machine and National Cash Register. Yet</p>
<p>we associate all these principles with Henry Ford, and rightly so.
For</p>
<p>each of them had been employed only as an auxiliary to the
traditional</p>
<p>manufacturing process. It was Ford who first combined them and</p>
<p>evolved out of them consciously and deliberately a new concept of</p>
<p>industrial production, a new technology. It is this new concept of
mass</p>
<p>production which in scarcely more than one generation gave us a
new</p>
<p>industrial civilization.</p>
<p>To Ford the importance of this new principle lay in its impact on</p>
<p>society as the means for producing an abundance of cheap goods
with</p>
<p>he minimum of human effort and toil. Mass production itself, how-</p>
<p>ever, he considered as something purely technical, as simply a
new</p>
<p>method of organizing mechanical forces. Ford disciples, heirs,
and</p>
<p>imitators, the engineers and production men who still run our big</p>
<p>industries, are certainly as convinced as their master that mass
produc-</p>
<p>ion is a mechanical technique; many use it as if it were a mere
gadget.</p>
<p>And Charlie Chaplin took the same view when, in Modern Times, he</p>
<p>caricatured our modern industrial civilization.</p>
<p>But if mass production were, indeed, only a technique, and
primar-</p>
<p>ily mechanical-if it were different in degree but not in kind
from</p>
<p>pulley, lever, or wheel-it could be applied only to mechanical
tasks</p>
<p>similar to the ones for which it was first developed. But long before
the</p>
<p>World War 11, mass production principles were used for such jobs
as</p>
<p>he sorting and filling of orders in a mail-order house and the
diagnosis</p>
<p>of patients in the Mayo Clinic. Henry Luce even used it successfully
to</p>
<p>organize writers-traditionally regarded as extreme
individualists-for</p>
<p>he mass production of interchangeable “formula-writing.“ During</p>
<p>World War I1 we applied mass-production principles to thousands
of</p>
<p>new products and processes and to such problems as the selection
and</p>
<p>raining of men in the armed services. In all these uses the
mechanisms</p>
<p>of the assembly line are purely subordinate, if, indeed, applied at
all.</p>
<p>In other words, mass production is not fundamentally a mechanical</p>
<p>principle, but a principle of social organization. It does not
coordinate</p>
<p>machines or the flow of parts; it organizes men and their work.</p>
<p>Ford’s importance lies precisely in the fact that his principle of
mass</p>
<p>production substitutes the coordination of human beings for the
coor-</p>
<p>dination of inanimate parts and of mechanical forces on which
industry</p>
<p>was originally based. When we talk of the Industrial Revolution,
we</p>
<p>hink at once of Watt’s steam engine. It is true that there was a lot
more</p>
<p>o the Industrial Revolution than new machines; but the steam engine
is</p>
<p>a good symbol for it because the essence of early industry was the
new</p>
<p>organization of mechanical forces. Mass production is based, how-</p>
<p>ever, on the organization of human beings and of human work-</p>
<p>something radically different from anything that was developed in
the</p>
<p>early days of industry. Indeed, it has brought about a new
Industrial</p>
<p>Revolution. The assembly line is a symbol for a new principle of
social</p>
<p>organization, a new relationship between men who work together in
a</p>
<p>common task, if not for a common purpose.</p>
<p>On what basis does this mass-production principle organize men?</p>
<p>What kind of society does it either assume or create? It assumes
or</p>
<p>creates a society in which things are produced by the cooperation
of</p>
<p>individuals, not by a single individual. By himself the individual
in</p>
<p>modem mass-production industry is completely unproductive and
inef-</p>
<p>fectual. But the organized group produces more, better, and more</p>
<p>effectively than any individual or any number of individuals
working</p>
<p>by themselves ever could. In this society the whole-the organized</p>
<p>group-is clearly not only more than, but different from, the sum of
its</p>
<p>parts.</p>
<p>Proof of this is what happens when a man loses his place in the</p>
<p>organized group or his access to the productive organism; when,
in</p>
<p>other words, he becomes unemployed. Under modern mass-production</p>
<p>conditions, the man who has lost his job is not just out of luck</p>
<p>economically; in fact, in a rich country such as ours, the direct</p>
<p>economic consequences of unemployment can be minimized almost to</p>
<p>he vanishing point. But he is incapable of producing anything, of</p>
<p>being effective in society; in short, he is incapable of being a
citizen;</p>
<p>he is cast out. For he derives his productiveness, his function in
the</p>
<p>community, his citizenship-at least his effective rather than
purely</p>
<p>formal citizenship-from his position in the group effort in the
team,</p>
<p>in the productive organism.</p>
<p>Henry Ford: The Last Populist 39</p>
<p>It is this social effect of unemployment, incidentally, rather than
the</p>
<p>economic effect, that makes it the major catastrophe it is. That
unem-</p>
<p>ployment endangers people’s standards of living is, of course,
bad</p>
<p>enough; but that it endangers their citizenship and self-respect is
its</p>
<p>real threat and explains our panicky fear of the “next
depression.“</p>
<p>In the society of the modem mass-production plant everyone
derives</p>
<p>his effectiveness from his position in an organized group effort.
From</p>
<p>his follow some important consequences. One is that such a
society</p>
<p>needs a government, a direction, a management responsible to no
one</p>
<p>special-interest group, to no one individual, but to the overall
purpose,</p>
<p>he overall maintenance and strengthening of the whole without
which</p>
<p>no individual, no special-interest group, could be effective. It
also</p>
<p>follows that in such a society there must be rank: a difference
of</p>
<p>authority and prestige based on the differentiation of functions. But
at</p>
<p>he same time, in such a society no one individual is less important
or</p>
<p>more important than another. For while no one individual is
irreplace-</p>
<p>able–only the organized relationship between individuals is
irreplace-</p>
<p>able and essential–every single operation, every single function,
is</p>
<p>equally necessary; the whole order would collapse, the entire
produc-</p>
<p>ive machine would come to a stop, were one to take out one
function,</p>
<p>one job-just as the whole chain becomes useless if one takes out
one</p>
<p>link. That is why, in such a society, there should be simultaneously
an</p>
<p>inequality of subordination and command, based on the
differentiation</p>
<p>of functions, and a basic equality, based on membership and
citizen-</p>
<p>ship.</p>
<p>This is by no means a new type of social organization; on the
contrary,</p>
<p>it is a very old one. It was described in the old Roman fable retold
in</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s Coriolanus which likened society to the human body,</p>
<p>none of whose organs-neither feet, nor hands, nor heart, nor
stomach-</p>
<p>could exist or work by itself, while yet the body could not
properly</p>
<p>work without any of them. It was expressed in the medieval
metaphors</p>
<p>of the order of the spheres and of the chain of being. And even as
a</p>
<p>practical way of organizing men for economic production, the
mass-</p>
<p>production principle is not new. Indeed, the first thorough
applications</p>
<p>of mass production and the assembly line were not in the Ford plant
in</p>
<p>Detroit, but hundreds of years earlier and thousands of miles away,
in</p>
<p>he workshops of the medieval stonemasons who built the great
cathe-</p>
<p>drals. In short, mass-production society, of which the assembly line
is</p>
<p>he symbol, is a hierarchical one.</p>
<p>This shows clearly when we analyze what popularly passes for a
clear</p>
<p>explanation of the essence of mass production: the saying that it</p>
<p>replaces skilled by unskilled labor. That is pure nonsense, if
taken</p>
<p>literally. Of course, in mass production manual skill is eliminated
by</p>
<p>breaking up each operation into the component simple operations,
with</p>
<p>each worker performing only one unskilled operation or a series
of</p>
<p>such. But this presupposes a fantastic skill in analyzing and
breaking</p>
<p>up the operation. The skill that is taken out of the manual operation
has</p>
<p>o be put back again further up the line, in the form of much
greater</p>
<p>knowledge, much more careful planning for the job; for there is such
a</p>
<p>hing as a law of the preservation of skill. And in addition mass</p>
<p>production needs a new skill: that of organizing and leading the
human</p>
<p>eam. Actually “unskilled“ mass production needs proportionately</p>
<p>more and more highly skilled men than “skilled“ production. The</p>
<p>skills themselves have changed from those of the craftsman to those
of</p>
<p>engineer, draftsman, and foreman; but the number of trained and</p>
<p>skilled men in American industry has been growing twice as fast
since</p>
<p>1910 as that of unskilled and semiskilled men.</p>
<p>Above all, the cooperation and coordination which are needed to</p>
<p>make possible the elimination of manual skill presuppose an
extraordi-</p>
<p>narily high level of social skill and social understanding, of
experience</p>
<p>in working together. The difficulties that our war plants had with
new</p>
<p>labor showed that very graphically. And, contrary to popular belief,
it</p>
<p>is no more difficult to export the old methods of industrial
production</p>
<p>o a new industrial country, even though those methods require
consid-</p>
<p>erable manual skill on the part of the worker, than it is to export
mass-</p>
<p>production techniques where no manual but a great deal of social
skill</p>
<p>is required.</p>
<p>What we mean when we say that mass production is based on</p>
<p>unskilled labor is simply that the individual becomes effective
and</p>
<p>productive only through his contribution to the whole, and not if</p>
<p>viewed separately. While no individual does the job, each one is
nec-</p>
<p>essary to get the job done. And the job, the end product of
cooperative</p>
<p>effort, is more skilled than anything the most skilled person could
have</p>
<p>produced by himself. As in every hierarchical society, there is
no</p>
<p>answer in the mass-production plant to the question of who does
the</p>
<p>job, but there is also no answer to the question of who does not do
the</p>
<p>job. For everybody has a part in it.</p>
<p>There were agood many industries even in the forties which did not
use</p>
<p>Henry Ford: The Last Populist 41</p>
<p>he mass-production principle. Among them are some of the most
effi-</p>
<p>cient ones, for instance, the modern cotton mills (in which one
worker</p>
<p>may manage a great many looms) and a good many of our chemical</p>
<p>industries (in which one worker may perform a number of different</p>
<p>functions). Nevertheless, the mass-production industries were
represen-</p>
<p>ative of American industry as a whole because they expressed in
the</p>
<p>purest form the essence of industrial production, i.e., a principle
of</p>
<p>social organization. The real Industrial Revolution of our day-the
one</p>
<p>which Henry Ford led and symbolized-was not a technological one,</p>
<p>was not based on this or that machine, this or that technique, but on
the</p>
<p>hierarchical coordination of human efforts which mass production</p>
<p>realizes in its purest form.</p>
<p>It is understandable that Henry Ford’s disciples and imitators
failed</p>
<p>o see the political and social implications of mass production
until</p>
<p>hey were confronted by them in the form of an aggressive union</p>
<p>movement, and very often not even then. For most of these men
were</p>
<p>really concerned with technical problems only and really believed
in</p>
<p>mechanical efficiency as an end in itself. But Henry Ford’s own</p>
<p>blindness cannot be so simply explained as due to a lack of social
or</p>
<p>political concem-not even as due to a lack of social or political</p>
<p>imagination. The real explanation is that Ford was concerned
exclu-</p>
<p>sively with the solution of the social and political problems of the
pre-</p>
<p>Ford, the pre-mass-production industrial civilization. And because
his</p>
<p>answers really did solve these problems, or at least the more
important</p>
<p>of them, it never entered his mind to subject this answer of his in
turn</p>
<p>o a social and political analysis. His gaze was firmly fixed on the
in-</p>
<p>dustrial reality of his own youth-the industrial reality against
which</p>
<p>populism had revolted in vain. He never even saw what he himself
had</p>
<p>called into being. As a high official of his own company once
said,</p>
<p>“What Mr. Ford really sees when he looks at River Rouge is the</p>
<p>machine shop in which he started in 1879.“</p>
<p>Though Henry Ford may never have heard of Brook Farm, of Robert</p>
<p>Owen’s New Harmony, or of any of the scores of utopian
communities</p>
<p>hat had dotted the Midwest not so many years before his birth in
1863,</p>
<p>hey were his intellectual ancestors. He took up where they had left
off;</p>
<p>and he succeeded where they had failed. Colonel McCormick’s Chi-</p>
<p>cago Tribune called him an “anarchist“ in the red-hunting days of</p>
<p>1919 when the term meant more or less what “communist“ would</p>
<p>mean today in the same paper. But in spite of the obvious absurdity
of</p>
<p>he charge, the jury awarded Ford only six cents in damages when
he</p>
<p>sued for libel; for he was undeniably a radical. He turned into a
stand-</p>
<p>patter after 1932, when his life’s work had shown itself a failure in
its</p>
<p>inability to produce the stable and happy society of which he had</p>
<p>dreamed. But the Henry Ford of the earlier Model T days was an</p>
<p>iconoclast attacking in the name of morality and science the
estab-</p>
<p>lished order of J. P. Morgan and of Mark Hanna’s Republican
party.</p>
<p>The utopias of the 1830s and 1840s were in themselves the
reaction</p>
<p>o a failure: the abortive attempt during Jackson’s administration
to</p>
<p>bring back to America the lost innocence of the Jeffersonian society
of</p>
<p>self-sufficient independent farmers. The utopians no longer hoped
to</p>
<p>be able to do away with the modern division of labor or even with</p>
<p>industry. On the contrary, they promised to obtain for mankind the
full</p>
<p>benefits of industrial productivity, but without its having to pay
the</p>
<p>price of subjecting itself to the “money power“ or to “monopoly“
or</p>
<p>of having to work in the “satanic mills“ of Blake’s great and
bitter</p>
<p>poem. These were to be eliminated by a blend of pious sentiment,</p>
<p>community regulations, and social science.</p>
<p>Of all the utopians only the Mormons survived-and they only by</p>
<p>flight from the land of the Gentiles. But though they failed,
Brook</p>
<p>Farm, New Zion, New Harmony, and all the other attempts at the</p>
<p>American industrial Jerusalem left a very deep imprint on the
con-</p>
<p>sciousness of the American people. Neither Fourier, whose ideas</p>
<p>fathered Brook Farm, nor Robert Owen, was an American. Yet it is</p>
<p>possible, indeed probable, that the mixture of earnest,
semireligious</p>
<p>sentiment and trust in a “scientific“ principle which is so typical
of the</p>
<p>American “reformer“ or “radical“ has its roots in much older and</p>
<p>deeper layers in our history than the utopias. But it is certain that
the</p>
<p>utopias determined the specific form which American radicalism
was</p>
<p>o take for a whole century. They provided the targets, the battle
cries,</p>
<p>and the weapons for populism, for Wilson’s New Freedom, and even</p>
<p>for much of the early New Deal (such as the “scientific“ gold
magic</p>
<p>of 1933). They fathered Henry George, Bellamy, and the antitrust</p>
<p>laws. They molded the beliefs and the hopes of America’s inland</p>
<p>empire in the Midwest. But they remained a futile gesture of
revolt</p>
<p>until Henry Ford came along.</p>
<p>Henry Ford: The Last Populist 43</p>
<p>Today we know that in depression and unemployment we have as</p>
<p>serious an economic problem as “monopoly“ and the “money pow-</p>
<p>er“ ever were. We see very clearly that mass production creates
as</p>
<p>many new social and political questions as it answers. Today we</p>
<p>realize that as afinal solution to the problems of an industrial
civiliza-</p>
<p>ion, Henry Ford’s solution is a failure.</p>
<p>But Ford’s mass production was not aimed at these new dangers,
but</p>
<p>at the traditional devils of American radicalism. And these it
actually</p>
<p>did exorcise. Ford succeeded in showing that industrial production
can</p>
<p>be production for the masses-instead of production for the benefit
of</p>
<p>monopolist or banker. Indeed, he showed that the most profitable</p>
<p>production is production for the masses. He proved that
industrial</p>
<p>production could give the workers increasing purchasing power to
buy</p>
<p>industrial products and to live on a middle-class standard; that was
the</p>
<p>meaning of his revolutionary .00-a-day minimum wage.</p>
<p>Finally-and to him most importantly-he proved that, properly</p>
<p>analyzed and handled, industrial production would free the
workers</p>
<p>from arduous toil. Under modern mass-production conditions, the</p>
<p>worker is confined to one routine operation requiring neither skill
nor</p>
<p>brawn nor mental effort. This fact would not have appeared to
Henry</p>
<p>Ford as a fatal defect, but as a supreme achievement; for it
meant</p>
<p>hat-in contrast to the tradition of the “satanic mills“-the
worker’s</p>
<p>skill, intelligence, and strength would be fully available for his
com-</p>
<p>munity life as an independent Jeffersonian citizen outside of the
plant</p>
<p>and after working hours.</p>
<p>At Brook Farm, too, the “real life“ was supposed to come in the</p>
<p>“communion of the spirits“ in the evening after the day’s work
had</p>
<p>been done; but the day’s work took so much time and effort that
the</p>
<p>“real life“ could be lived only by neglecting the work. Mass
produc-</p>
<p>ion cuts both time and energy required for the day’s work so as to
give</p>
<p>he worker plenty of scope for this “real life.“ No wonder that
Ford-</p>
<p>he Ford of 1919-thought he had built the “New Jerusalem“ on a</p>
<p>permanent foundation of steel, concrete, and four-lane highways.</p>
<p>It was Ford’s personal tragedy to live long enough to see his
utopia</p>
<p>crumble. He was forced to abandon his basic economic
principle-the</p>
<p>principle of the cheapest possible production of the most
utilitarian</p>
<p>commodity. First he scrapped the Model T. That was in 1927. Then,</p>
<p>five years later, he abandoned the Model A and adopted the annual</p>
<p>model change which substitutes the appeal of prestige and fashion
for</p>
<p>he appeal of cheapness and utility. When he did this he became
just</p>
<p>another automobile manufacturer. Even so, his share in the market</p>
<p>dropped from nearly half in 1925 to less than 20 percent in 1940.
Even</p>
<p>more decisively proven was his failure to give the worker
industrial</p>
<p>citizenship; in 1941 the Ford workers voted to join the CIO
almost</p>
<p>hree to one.</p>
<p>Up to the hour when the results were announced, the old man is
said</p>
<p>o have firmly believed that “his“ workers would never vote for a</p>
<p>union. All along he had fought off realization of his defeat by
pretend-</p>
<p>ing to himself that his downfall was being caused by sinister
conspir-</p>
<p>acies rather than by faults in the structure of the community which
he</p>
<p>had built. This tendency to look for personal devils-itself a
legacy</p>
<p>from the utopians-had shown itself quite early in the tirades of
the</p>
<p>Dearborn Independent against international bankers, Wall Street,
and</p>
<p>he Jews during the 1920s. It became the basis on which he fought
the</p>
<p>unions all through the thirties. It also probably explains why
Harry</p>
<p>Bennett, starting as the plant’s chief cop, rose to be the most
powerful</p>
<p>individual in the Ford organization of the thirties and the only one
who</p>
<p>really seemed to enjoy the old man’s confidence. But the union</p>
<p>victory, followed shortly by the unionization of the foremen,
must</p>
<p>have hit Henry Ford as a repudiation of all he had thought he had</p>
<p>achieved, and had achieved primarily for the workers. The last years
of</p>
<p>he old man must have been very bitter ones, indeed.</p>
<p>The lesson of Ford’s ultimate failure is that we cannot hope to
solve</p>
<p>he problems of the mass-production society by technological
devices</p>
<p>or by changing the economics of distribution. These were the two</p>
<p>approaches on which all nineteenth-century thought had relied,
wheth-</p>
<p>er orthodox or rebel. Henry Ford went as far along these lines as it
is</p>
<p>possible to go.</p>
<p>For the time being, the political results of Ford’s achievement
were</p>
<p>extraordinary. It took the wind out of the sails of the socialist
critique</p>
<p>of capitalist society. In this country it brought about the change
from</p>
<p>he fiery political action of Eugene Debs to the politically
impotent</p>
<p>moralism of Norman Thomas; in continental Europe it converted
social</p>
<p>Henry Ford: The Last Populist 45</p>
<p>democracy from a millennia1 fighting creed into a respectable but
timid</p>
<p>bureaucracy. Even more telling was the reaction of Communist
Russia</p>
<p>o Ford. In the twenties the Russians had to add to the messianic
hopes</p>
<p>of Karl Marx the promise of achieving eventually in a socialist
society</p>
<p>what Ford had already achieved in a capitalist one: a chance for
the</p>
<p>worker to drive to the plant in his own car and to work in collar and
tie,</p>
<p>and without getting calluses on his hands. And until 1929, as
every</p>
<p>meeting of the Third International affirmed, the communists were</p>
<p>completely convinced that Ford’s America had actually solved the</p>
<p>basic problems of capitalism and had restored it to ascendancy all
the</p>
<p>world over. Not until the Great Depression were the communist
lead-</p>
<p>ers able to revitalize their creed by making it appear to do what
it</p>
<p>cannot do: to solve, by the sheer force of the police state, the new,
the</p>
<p>post-Ford problems of industrial society as they appeared after
1929.</p>
<p>As we in America confront these problems, the economic ones will</p>
<p>not be the most difficult. Indeed, the chief economic problem of
our</p>
<p>ime-the prevention of depressions-should be solvable by basically</p>
<p>mechanical means: by adapting our employment, fiscal, and
budgeting</p>
<p>practices to the time span of industrial production-that is, to
the</p>
<p>business cycle. Much more baffling, and more basic, is the
political</p>
<p>and social problem with which twentieth-century industrialism
con-</p>
<p>fronts us: the problem of developing order and citizenship within
the</p>
<p>plant, of building a free, self-governing industrial society.</p>
<p>The fact that Henry Ford, after his superb success, failed so
sig-</p>
<p>nally-that there is today such a grim contrast between his social</p>
<p>utopia and our social reality-mphasizes the magnitude of the
politi-</p>
<p>cal task before us. But however treacherous the social jungle of
post-</p>
<p>Ford, mass-production society, however great the danger that it
will</p>
<p>fester into civil war and tyranny, the twentieth-century evils
which</p>
<p>Henry Ford left to us may well be less formidable than the
nineteenth-</p>
<p>century evils which he vanquished.</p>
