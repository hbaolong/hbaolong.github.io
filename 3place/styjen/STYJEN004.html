<h4 id="calhouns-pluralism">Calhoun’s Pluralism</h4>
<p>The American party system has been under attack almost continu-</p>
<p>ously since it took definite form in the time of Andrew Jackson.
The</p>
<p>criticism has always been directed at the same point: America’s
politi-</p>
<p>cal pluralism, the distinctively American organization of
government</p>
<p>by compromise of interests, pressure groups, and sections. And
the</p>
<p>aim of the critics, from Thaddeus Stevens to Henry Wallace, has</p>
<p>always been to substitute for this “unprincipled“ pluralism a
govern-</p>
<p>ment based, as in Europe, on “ideologies“ and “principles.“ But</p>
<p>never before-at least not since the Civil War years-has the
crisis</p>
<p>been as acute as in this last decade; for the political problems
which</p>
<p>dominate our national life today-foreign policy and industrial
po-</p>
<p>licy-are precisely the problems which interest and pressure-group</p>
<p>compromise is least equipped to handle. And while the crisis
symp-</p>
<p>oms-a left-wing third party and the threatened split-off of the
south-</p>
<p>ern wing-are more alarming in the Democratic party, the
Republicans</p>
<p>are hardly much better off. The 1940 boom for the “idealist“
Willkie</p>
<p>and the continued inability to attract a substantial portion of the
labor</p>
<p>vote are definite signs that the Republican party, too, is under
severe</p>
<p>ideological pressure.</p>
<p>Yet, there is almost no understanding of the problem-precisely</p>
<p>because there is so little understanding of the basic principles
of</p>
<p>American pluralism. Of course, every politician in this country
must</p>
<p>be able instinctively to work in terms of sectional and interest
compro-</p>
<p>First published in The Review of Politics, 1948</p>
<p>mise, and the voter takes it for granted. But there is practically
no</p>
<p>awareness of the fact that organization on the basis of sectional
and</p>
<p>interest compromise is both the distinctly American form of
political</p>
<p>organization and the cornerstone of practically all major
political</p>
<p>institutions of the modem United States. As acute an observer as</p>
<p>Winston Churchill apparently did not understand that Congress
works</p>
<p>on a basis entirely different from that of Britain’s Parliament,
neither</p>
<p>do nine out of ten Americans and 999 out of 1,000 teachers of
those</p>
<p>courses in “Civics.“ There is even less understanding that
sectional</p>
<p>and interest-group pluralism is not just the venal expediency of
that</p>
<p>stock villain of American folklore, the “politician,“ but that it in
itself</p>
<p>is a basic ideology, a basic principle-and the one which is the
very</p>
<p>foundation of our free society and government.</p>
<p>To find an adequate analysis of the principle of government by</p>
<p>sectional and interest compromise, we have to go back more than a</p>
<p>hundred years to John C. Calhoun and to his two political
treatises’</p>
<p>published after his death in 1852. Absurd, you will say, for it
is</p>
<p>practically an axiom of American history that Calhoun’s political</p>
<p>heories, subtle, even profound though they may have been, were</p>
<p>reduced to absurdity and irrelevance by the Civil War. Yet, this</p>
<p>“axiom“ is nothing but a partisan vote of the Reconstruction
period.</p>
<p>Of course, the specific occasion for which Calhoun formulated his</p>
<p>heories, the slavery issue, has been decided; and for the
constitutional</p>
<p>veto power of the states over national legislation, by means of
which</p>
<p>Calhoun proposed to formalize the principle of sectional and
interest</p>
<p>compromise, was substituted in actual practice the much more
power-</p>
<p>ful and much more elastic but extraconstitutional and extralegal
veto</p>
<p>power of sections, interests, and pressure groups in Congress and</p>
<p>within the parties.* But his basic principle itself: that every
major</p>
<p>interest in the country, whether regional, economic, or religious, is
to</p>
<p>possess a veto power on political decisions directly aflecting it,
the</p>
<p>principle which Calhoun called, rather obscurely, “the rule of
concur-</p>
<p>rent majority, “ has become the organizing principle of American</p>
<p>politics. And it is precisely this principle that is under fire
today.</p>
<p>What makes Calhoun so important as the major key to the under-</p>
<p>Calhoun’s Pluralism 17</p>
<p>standing of American politics is not just that he saw the importance
in</p>
<p>American political life of sectional and interest pluralism; other
major</p>
<p>analysts of our government, de Tocqueville, for instance, or Bryce
or</p>
<p>Wilson, saw that, too. But Calhoun, perhaps alone, saw in it more
than</p>
<p>a rule of expediency, imposed by the country’s size and justifiable
by</p>
<p>results, if at all. He saw in it a basic principle of free
government.</p>
<p>Without this [the rule of concurrent majority based on interests
rather than on</p>
<p>principles] there can be . . . no constitution. The assertion is true
in reference to all</p>
<p>constitutional governments, be their forms what they may: It is
indeed, the negative</p>
<p>power which makes the constitution-and the positive which makes the
govern-</p>
<p>ment. The one is the power of acting-and the other the power of
preventing or</p>
<p>arresting action. The two, combined, make constitutional
government.</p>
<p>. . . it follows, necessarily, that where the numerical majority has
the sole control</p>
<p>of the government, there can be no constitution . . . and hence, the
numerical,</p>
<p>unmixed with the concurrent majority, necessarily forms, in all
cases, absolute</p>
<p>government.</p>
<p>. . . The principle by which they (governments) are upheld and
preserved . . . in</p>
<p>constitutional governments is compromise;-and in absolute governments
is</p>
<p>force. . . .’</p>
<p>And however much the American people may complain in words</p>
<p>about the “unprincipled“ nature of their political system, by
their</p>
<p>actions they have always shown that they, too, believe that
without</p>
<p>sectional and interest compromises there can be no constitutional</p>
<p>government. If this is not grasped, American government and
politics</p>
<p>must appear not only as cheap to the point of venality; they must</p>
<p>appear as utterly irrational and unpredictable.</p>
<p>Sectional and interest pluralism has molded all American
political</p>
<p>institutions. It is the method–entirely unofficial and
extraconstitution-</p>
<p>al-through which the organs of government are made to function,</p>
<p>hrough which leaders are selected, policies developed, men and</p>
<p>groups organized for the conquest and management of political
power.</p>
<p>In particular it is the explanation for the most distinctive features
of</p>
<p>he American political system: the way in which Congress operates,</p>
<p>he way in which major government departments are set up and run,
the</p>
<p>qualifications for “eligibility“ as a candidate for elective office,
and</p>
<p>he American party structure.</p>
<p>To all foreign observers of Congress two things have always re-</p>
<p>mained mysterious: the distinction between the official party label
and</p>
<p>he “blocs“ which cut across party lines; and the power and
function</p>
<p>of the congressional committees. And most Americans, though less</p>
<p>amazed by the phenomena, are equally baffled.</p>
<p>The “blocs“-the “Farm Bloc,“ the “Friends of Labor in the</p>
<p>Senate,“ the “Business Groups,“ and so on-are simply the expres-</p>
<p>sion of the basic tenet of sectional and interest pluralism that
major</p>
<p>interests have a veto power on legislation directly affecting them.
For</p>
<p>his reason they must cut across party lines-that is, lines
expressing</p>
<p>he numerical rather than the “concurrent“ majority. And because</p>
<p>hese blocks have (a) only a negative veto and (b) that only on
mea-</p>
<p>sures directly affecting them, they cannot in themselves be
permanent</p>
<p>groupings replacing the parties. They must be loosely organized;
and</p>
<p>one and the same member of Congress must at different times vote</p>
<p>with different blocs. The strength of the blocs does not rest on
their</p>
<p>numbers, but on the basic mores of American politics which grant</p>
<p>every major interest group a limited self-determination-as
expressed</p>
<p>graphically in the near sanctity of a senatorial filibuster. The
power of</p>
<p>he Farm Bloc, for instance, does not rest on the numerical strength
of</p>
<p>he rural vote-a minority vote even in the Senate with its
dispropor-</p>
<p>ionate representation of the thinly populated agricultural
states-but</p>
<p>on its “strategic“ strength, that is, on its being the spokesman for
a</p>
<p>recognized major interest.</p>
<p>Subordination of a major interest is possible, but only in a
“tempo-</p>
<p>rary emergency. “ Most of the New Deal measures were, palpably,</p>
<p>neither temporary nor emergency measures; yet their sponsors had
to</p>
<p>present them, and convincingly, as “temporary emergency measures“</p>
<p>because they could be enacted only by overriding the
extraconstitu-</p>
<p>ional veto of the business interest.</p>
<p>Once the excuse of the “temporary emergency“ had fully lost its</p>
<p>plausibility, that major interest could no longer be voted down; and
the</p>
<p>policy collapsed. By 1946, for instance, labor troubles could be
re-</p>
<p>solved only on a basis acceptable to both labor and employer:
higher</p>
<p>wages and higher prices. (Even if a numerical majority had been</p>
<p>available to legislate against either party-and the business
group</p>
<p>Calhoun’s Pluralism 19</p>
<p>could probably still have been voted down in the late forties-the</p>
<p>solution had to be acceptable to both parties.)</p>
<p>The principle of sectional and interest compromise leads directly
to</p>
<p>he congressional committee system-a system to which there is no</p>
<p>parallel anywhere in the world. Congress, especially the House,
has</p>
<p>largely abdicated to its committees because only in the quiet and</p>
<p>secrecy of a committee room can sectional compromise be worked
out.</p>
<p>The discussion on the floor as well as the recorded vote is far
too</p>
<p>public and therefore largely for the folks back home. But a
commit-</p>
<p>ee’s business is to arrive at an agreement between all major
sectional</p>
<p>interests affected; which explains the importance of getting a
bill</p>
<p>before the “right“ committee. In any but an American legislature
the</p>
<p>position of each member, once a bill is introduced, is fixed by
the</p>
<p>stand of his party, which, in turn, is decided on grounds that have
little</p>
<p>o do with the measure itself, but are rather dictated by the balance
of</p>
<p>power in the government and by party programs. Hence it makes</p>
<p>usually little difference which committee discusses a bill or whether
it</p>
<p>goes before a committee at all. In the United States, however, a
bill’s</p>
<p>assignment to a specific committee decides which interest groups
are</p>
<p>o be recognized as affected by the measure and therefore entitled to
a</p>
<p>part in writing it (“who is to have standing before the
committee“),</p>
<p>for each committee represents a specific constellation of interests.
In</p>
<p>many cases this first decision therefore decides the fate of a
proposed</p>
<p>measure, especially as the compromise worked out by the committee
is</p>
<p>generally accepted once it reaches the floor, especially in the
House.</p>
<p>It is not only Congress but every individual member of Congress</p>
<p>himself who is expected to operate according to the “rule of
concur-</p>
<p>rent majority. ’’ He is considered both a representative of the
American</p>
<p>people and responsible to the national interest and a delegate of
his</p>
<p>constituents and responsible to their particular interests. Wherever
the</p>
<p>immediate interests of his constituents are not in question, he is to
be a</p>
<p>statesman; wherever their conscience or their pocketbooks are af-</p>
<p>fected, he is to be a business agent. This is in sharp contrast to
the</p>
<p>heory on which any parliamentary government is based-a theory</p>
<p>developed a full two hundred years ago in Edmund Burke’s famous</p>
<p>speech to the voters at Bristol-according to which a member of</p>
<p>Parliament represents the commonwealth rather than his
constituents.</p>
<p>Hence in all parliamentary countries, the representative can be a</p>
<p>stranger to his constituency-in the extreme, as it was practiced
in</p>
<p>Weimar Germany, there is one long national list of candidates who
run</p>
<p>in all constituencies-whereas the congressman in this country must
be</p>
<p>a resident of his constituency. And while an American senator
consid-</p>
<p>ers it a compliment and an asset to be called “Cotton Ed Smith,“
the</p>
<p>Speaker of the House of Commons not so long ago severely repri-</p>
<p>manded a member for calling another member-an official of the</p>
<p>miners’ union-a “representative of the coal miners.“</p>
<p>The principle of sectional and interest pluralism also explains
why</p>
<p>his is the only nation where Cabinet members are charged by law
with</p>
<p>he representation of special interests-labor, agriculture,
commerce.</p>
<p>In every other country an agency of the government-any agency of</p>
<p>he government-is solemnly sworn to guard the public interest
against</p>
<p>“the interests.“ In this country the concept of a government
depart-</p>
<p>ment as the representative of a special interest group is carried
down to</p>
<p>smaller agencies and even to divisions and branches of a
department.</p>
<p>This showed itself, for example, during World War I1 in such fights
as</p>
<p>hat between OPA, representing the consumer, and the War
Production</p>
<p>Board, representing the producer; or within WPB between the
Procure-</p>
<p>ment branches, speaking for the war industries, and the Civilian</p>
<p>Requirements Branch, speaking for the industries producing for
the</p>
<p>’ ‘home front.’ ’</p>
<p>The mystery of “eligibility“-the criterion which decides who will</p>
<p>make a promising candidate for public office-which has baffled so</p>
<p>many foreign and American observers, Bryce, for instance-also</p>
<p>races back to the “rule of the concurrent majority.“ Eligibility
simply</p>
<p>means that a candidate must not be unacceptable to any major
interest,</p>
<p>religious, or regional group in the electorate; it is primarily a
negative</p>
<p>qualification. Eligibility operates on all levels and applies to all
elec-</p>
<p>ive offices. It has been brilliantly analyzed in “Boss“ Flynn’s
You’re</p>
<p>he Boss. His classical example is the selection of Harry Truman
as</p>
<p>Democratic vice-presidential candidate in 1944. Truman was
“eligi-</p>
<p>ble“ rather than Wallace, Byrnes, or Douglas precisely because he</p>
<p>was unknown; because he was neither easterner nor westerner nor</p>
<p>southerner, because he was neither New Deal nor Conservative, and
so</p>
<p>on; in short, because he had no one trait strong enough to offend</p>
<p>anybody anywhere.</p>
<p>But the central institution based on sectional pluralism is the
Ameri-</p>
<p>Calhoun’s Pluralism 21</p>
<p>can party. Completely extraconstitutional, the wonder and the
despair</p>
<p>of every foreign observer who cannot fit it into any of his concepts
of</p>
<p>political life, the American party (rather than the states) has
become</p>
<p>he instrument to realize Calhoun’s “rule of the concurrent
majority.“</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the parties of Europe, the American party has
no</p>
<p>program and no purpose except to organize divergent groups for
the</p>
<p>common pursuit and conquest of power. Its unity is one of action,
not</p>
<p>of beliefs. Its only rule is to attract-r at least not to repel-the
largest</p>
<p>possible number of groups. It must, by definition, by acceptable</p>
<p>equally to the right and the left, the rich and the poor, the farmer
and</p>
<p>he worker, the Protestant and the Catholic, the native and the
foreign-</p>
<p>born. It must be able to rally Mr. Rankin of Mississippi and Mr.</p>
<p>Marcantonio of New York-r Senator Flanders and Colonel</p>
<p>McCormick-behind the same Presidential candidate and the same</p>
<p>“platform. “</p>
<p>As soon as it cannot appeal at least to a minority in every major</p>
<p>group (as soon, in other words, as it provokes the veto of one
section,</p>
<p>interest, or class) a party is in danger of disintegration. Whenever
a</p>
<p>party loses its ability to fuse sectional pressures and class
interests into</p>
<p>one national policy-both parties just before the Civil War, the
Repub-</p>
<p>lican party before its reorganization by Mark Hanna, both parties
again</p>
<p>oday-the party system (and with it the American political system</p>
<p>altogether) is in crisis.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is not that Calhoun was repudiated by the Civil</p>
<p>War, which is the key to the understanding of American politics,
but</p>
<p>hat he has become triumphant since.</p>
<p>The apparent victors, the “Radical Republicans, “ Thaddeus Stev-</p>
<p>ens, Seward, Chief Justice Chase, were out to destroy not only
slavery</p>
<p>and states’ rights but the “rule of the concurrent majority“ itself.
And</p>
<p>he early Republican party-before the Civil War and in the Recon-</p>
<p>struction period-was, indeed, determined to substitute principle
for</p>
<p>interest as the lodestar of American political life. But in the end
it was</p>
<p>he political thought of convinced pluralists such as Abraham
Lincoln</p>
<p>and Andrew Johnson, rather than the ideologies of the Free Soilers
and</p>
<p>Abolitionists, which molded the Republican party. And ever since,
the</p>
<p>major developments of American politics have been based on Cal-</p>
<p>houn’s principle. To this the United States owes the strength as well
as</p>
<p>he weaknesses of its political system.</p>
<p>The weaknesses of sectional and interest compromise are far more</p>
<p>obvious than its virtues; they have been hammered home for a
hundred</p>
<p>years. Francis Lieber, who brought the dominant German political</p>
<p>heories of the early nineteenth century to this country, attacked
plural-</p>
<p>ism in Calhoun’s own state of South Carolina a century ago.
Twenty</p>
<p>years later Walter Bagehot contrasted, impressively, General
Grant’s</p>
<p>impotent administration with those of Gladstone and Disraeli to
show</p>
<p>he superiority of ideological party organization. The most
thorough</p>
<p>and most uncompromising criticism came from Woodrow Wilson; and</p>
<p>every single one of the Professor’s points was amply borne out by
his</p>
<p>later experience as President. Time has not made these weaknesses
any</p>
<p>less dangerous.</p>
<p>There is, first of all, the inability of a political system based on
the</p>
<p>“rule of the concurrent majority“ to resolve conflicts of principles.
All</p>
<p>a pluralist system can do is to deny that “ideological“ conflicts
(as</p>
<p>hey are called nowadays) do exist. Those conflicts, a pluralist
must</p>
<p>assert, are fundamentally either struggles for naked power or
friction</p>
<p>between interest groups which could be solved if only the
quarreling</p>
<p>parties sat down around a conference table. Perhaps, the most
perfect,</p>
<p>because most naYve, expression of this belief remains the late
General</p>
<p>Patton’s remark that the Nazis were, after all, not so very
different</p>
<p>from Republicans or Democrats. (Calhoun, while less naYve, was as</p>
<p>unable to understand the reality of “ideological“ conflict in and</p>
<p>around the slavery problem.)</p>
<p>In nine cases out of ten the refusal to acknowledge the existence
of</p>
<p>ideological conflict is beneficial. It prevents fights for power,
or</p>
<p>clashes of interests, from flaring into religious wars where
irreconcil-</p>
<p>able principles collide (a catastrophe against which Europe’s
ideologi-</p>
<p>cal politics have almost no defense). It promotes compromise
where</p>
<p>compromise is possible. But in a genuine clash of principles-and,</p>
<p>whatever the pluralists say, there are such clashes-the “rule of</p>
<p>concurrent majority“ breaks down; it did, in Calhoun’s
generation,</p>
<p>before the profound reality of the slavery issue. A legitimate
ideologi-</p>
<p>cal conflict is actually aggravated by the pluralists’ refusal to
accept its</p>
<p>reality: the compromisers who thought the slavery issue could be</p>
<p>settled by the meeting of good intentions, or by the payment of
money,</p>
<p>Calhoun’s Pluralism 23</p>
<p>may have done more than the Abolitionists to make the Civil War</p>
<p>inevitable.</p>
<p>A weakness of sectional and interest pluralism just as serious is
that</p>
<p>it amounts to a principle of inaction. The popular assertion, “It’s
better</p>
<p>o make the wrong decision than to do nothing at all,“ is, of
course,</p>
<p>fallacious; but no nation, however unlimited its resources, can have
a</p>
<p>very effective policy if its government is based on a principle
that</p>
<p>orders it to do nothing important except unanimously. Moreover,</p>
<p>pluralism increases exorbitantly the weight of well-organized
small</p>
<p>interest groups, especially when they lobby against a decision.
Con-</p>
<p>gress can far too easily be high-pressured into emasculating a bill
by</p>
<p>he expedient of omitting its pertinent provisions; only with much</p>
<p>greater difficulty can Congress be moved to positive action. This</p>
<p>explains, to a large extent, the eclipse of Congress during the
last</p>
<p>hundred years, both in popular respect and in its actual momentum
as</p>
<p>policymaking organ of government. Congress, which the founding</p>
<p>fathers had intended to be the central organ of government-a role</p>
<p>which it fulfilled up to Andrew Jackson-became the compound
repre-</p>
<p>sentative of sections and interests and, consequently,
progressively</p>
<p>incapable of national leadership.</p>
<p>Pluralism gives full weight-more than full weight-to sections and</p>
<p>interests; but who is to represent the national welfare? Ever since
the</p>
<p>days of Calhoun, the advocates of pluralism have tried to dodge
this</p>
<p>question by contending that the national interest is equal to the sum
of</p>
<p>all particular interests and that it therefore does not need a
special</p>
<p>organ of representation. But this most specious argument is
contra-</p>
<p>dicted by the most elementary observation. In practice, pluralism
tends</p>
<p>o resolve sectional and class conflicts at the expense of the
national</p>
<p>interest which is represented by nobody in particular, by no section
and</p>
<p>no organization.</p>
<p>These weaknesses had already become painfully obvious while</p>
<p>Calhoun was alive and active4uring the decade after Andrew Jack-</p>
<p>son, the first president of pluralism. Within a few years after
Cal-</p>
<p>houn’s death, the inability of the new system to comprehend and
to</p>
<p>resolve an ideological conflict-ultimately its inability to represent
and</p>
<p>o guard the national interest-had brought catastrophe. For a
hundred</p>
<p>years and more, American political thought has therefore revolved</p>
<p>around attempts to counteract if not to overcome these
weaknesses.</p>
<p>Three major developments of American constitutional life were the</p>
<p>result: the growth of the functions and powers of the president and
his</p>
<p>emergence as a “leader“ rather than as the executive agent of the</p>
<p>Congress; the rise of the Supreme Court, with its “rule of law,“ to
the</p>
<p>position of arbiter of policy; the development of a unifying
ideology-</p>
<p>he “American Creed. “</p>
<p>Of these the most important-and the least noticed-is the Ameri-</p>
<p>can Creed. In fact, I know of no writer of major importance since
de</p>
<p>Tocqueville who has given much attention to it. Yet even the term</p>
<p>“un-American“ cannot be translated successfully into any other
lan-</p>
<p>guage, least of all into “English“ English. In no other country
could</p>
<p>he identity of the nation with a certain set of ideas be
assumed-at</p>
<p>least not under a free government. This unique cohesion on
principles</p>
<p>shows, for instance, in the refusal of the American voter to
accept</p>
<p>socialists and communists as “normal“ parties, simply because
both</p>
<p>groups refuse to accept the assumption of a common American
ideolo-</p>
<p>gy. It shows, for another example, in the indigenous structure of
the</p>
<p>American labor movement with its emphasis on interest pressure
rather</p>
<p>han on a political philosophy. And this is also the only Western</p>
<p>country where “Civics“ are taught in schools-the only democratic</p>
<p>country which believes that a correct social philosophy could or
should</p>
<p>be part of public education.</p>
<p>In Europe, a universal creed would be considered incompatible
with</p>
<p>a free society. Before the advent of totalitarianism, no European</p>
<p>country had ever known anything comparable to the flag salute of
the</p>
<p>American school child.4For in Europe all political activity is based
on</p>
<p>ideological factions; consequently, to introduce a uniform ideology
in</p>
<p>a European country is to stamp out all opposition. In the United
States</p>
<p>ideological homogeneity is the very basis of political diversity.
It</p>
<p>makes possible the almost unlimited freedom of interest groups,
reli-</p>
<p>gious groups, pressure groups, and the like; and in this way it is
the</p>
<p>very fundament of free government. (It also explains why the
preserva-</p>
<p>ion of civil liberties has been so much more important a problem
in</p>
<p>his country-as compared to England or France, for instance.) The</p>
<p>assumption of ideological unity gives the United States the
minimum</p>
<p>of cohesion without which its political system simply could not
have</p>
<p>worked.</p>
<p>Calhoun’s Pluralism 25</p>
<p>But is even the “American dream“ enough to make a system based</p>
<p>on the “rule of the concurrent majority“ work today? Can
pluralism</p>
<p>handle the two major problems of American politics-the
formulation</p>
<p>of a foreign policy, and the political organization of an
industrial</p>
<p>society-any more successfully than it could handle the slavery
issue?</p>
<p>Or is the American political system as much in crisis as it was in
the</p>
<p>last years of Calhoun’s life, and for pretty much the same
reasons?</p>
<p>A foreign policy can never be evolved by adding particular in-</p>
<p>erests-regional, economic, or racial–or by compromising among</p>
<p>hem; it must supersede them. If Calhoun’s contention that the
national</p>
<p>interest will automatically be served by serving the interests of
the</p>
<p>parts is wrong anywhere, it is provably wrong in the field of
foreign</p>
<p>affairs.</p>
<p>A foreign policy and a party system seem to be compatible only if</p>
<p>he parties are organized on programmatic grounds, that is, on
princi-</p>
<p>ples. For if not based on general principles, a foreign policy
will</p>
<p>become a series of improvisations without rhyme or reason. In a
free</p>
<p>society, in which parties compete for votes and power, the
formulation</p>
<p>of a foreign policy may thus force the parties into ideological
attitudes</p>
<p>which will sooner or later be reflected in their domestic policies,
too.</p>
<p>This was clearly realized in the early years of the Republic,
when</p>
<p>foreign policy was vital to a new nation, clinging precariously to a
long</p>
<p>seaboard without hinterland, engaged in a radical experiment with
new</p>
<p>political institutions, surrounded by the Great Powers of that
time,</p>
<p>England, France, and Spain, all of them actually or potentially
hostile.</p>
<p>This awareness of foreign policy largely explains why the party
system</p>
<p>of the founding fathers+specially of Hamilton-was an ideological</p>
<p>one; it also explains why the one positive foreign-policy concept
this</p>
<p>country developed during the nineteenth century, the Monroe Doc-</p>
<p>rine, was formulated by the last two politically active survivors of
the</p>
<p>founding generation, Monroe and John Quincy Adams. No matter how</p>
<p>little Calhoun himself realized it, his doctrine would have been
impos-</p>
<p>sible without the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars
which,</p>
<p>during the most critical period of American integration, kept our</p>
<p>potential European enemies busy. By 1820, the country had become</p>
<p>oo strong, had taken in too much territory, to be easily attacked;
and it</p>
<p>was still not strong enough, and far too much absorbed in the
develop-</p>
<p>ment of its own interior, to play a part in international affairs.
Hence</p>
<p>Calhoun, and all America with him, could push foreign policy out
of</p>
<p>heir minds-so much so that this is the only country in which it
is</p>
<p>possible to write a comprehensive work on an important historical</p>
<p>period without as much as a mention of foreign affairs, as Arthur
M.</p>
<p>Schlesinger, Jr., managed to do in his Age of Jackson.</p>
<p>But today foreign policy is again as vital for the survival of
the</p>
<p>nation as it ever was during the administrations of Washington
and</p>
<p>Jefferson. And it has to be a foreign policy, that is, a making
of</p>
<p>decisions; hence neither “isolationism“ nor “internationalism“
will</p>
<p>do. (For “internationa1ism~’-the search for formulas which will
pro-</p>
<p>vide automatic decisions, even in advance-is also a refusal to have
a</p>
<p>foreign policy; it may well have done this country, and the world,
as</p>
<p>much harm as “isolationism“-perhaps more.) To survive as the</p>
<p>strongest of the Great Powers, the United States might even have
to</p>
<p>accept permanently the supremacy of foreign policies over
domestic</p>
<p>affairs, however much this may go against basic American convic-</p>
<p>ions, and indeed against the American grain. But no foreign
policy</p>
<p>can be evolved by the compromise of sectional interests or
economic</p>
<p>pressures; yet neither party, as today constituted, could develop
a</p>
<p>foreign policy based on definite principles.</p>
<p>The other great national need is to resolve the political problems
of</p>
<p>an industrial society. An industrial society is by nature
ultrapluralistic,</p>
<p>because it develops class and interest groups that are far stronger,
and</p>
<p>far more tightly organized, than any interest group in a
preindustrial</p>
<p>age. A few big corporations, a few big unions, may be the
actually</p>
<p>decisive forces in an industrial society. And these groups can
put</p>
<p>decisive pressure on society: they can throttle social and economic
life.</p>
<p>The problem does not lie in “asocial behavior“ of this or that
group,</p>
<p>but in the nature of industrial society, which bears much closer
resem-</p>
<p>blance to feudalism than to the trading nineteenth century. Its
political</p>
<p>problems are very similar to those which feudalism had to
solve-and</p>
<p>failed to solve. It is in perpetual danger of disintegration into
virtually</p>
<p>autonomous fiefs, principalities, “free cities ,“ “robber baronies,
“</p>
<p>and “exempt bishoprics“-the authority and the interest of the
nation</p>
<p>rampled underfoot, autonomous groups uniting to control the
central</p>
<p>Calhoun’s Pluralism 27</p>
<p>power in their own interest or disregarding government in
fighting</p>
<p>each other in the civil conflict of class warfare. And the
alternative to</p>
<p>such a collapse into anarchy or civil war-the suppression of
classes</p>
<p>and interest groups by an all-powerful government-is hardly more</p>
<p>attractive.</p>
<p>An industrial society cannot function without an organ able to</p>
<p>superimpose the national interest on economic or class interests.
More</p>
<p>han a mere arbiter is needed. The establishment of the “rules of</p>
<p>civilized industrial warfare,“ as was done by both the Wagner Act
and</p>
<p>he Taft-Hartley Act, tries to avoid the need for policies by
equalizing</p>
<p>he strength of the conflicting sections; but that can lead only
to</p>
<p>deadlock, to collusion against the national interest, or, worse
still, to</p>
<p>he attempt to make the national authority serve the interest of one
side</p>
<p>against the other. In other words, an industrial society cannot
fully</p>
<p>accept Calhoun’s assumption that the national good will evolve
from</p>
<p>he satisfaction of particular interests. An industrial society
without</p>
<p>national policy will become both anarchic and despotic.</p>
<p>Small wonder that there has been increasing demand for a radical</p>
<p>change which would substitute ideological parties and
programmatic</p>
<p>policies for the pluralist parties and the “rule of the concurrent
major-</p>
<p>ity“ of the American tradition. Henry Wallace’s Third Party Move-</p>
<p>ment, while the most publicized, may well be the least
significant</p>
<p>development; for third parties are, after all, nothing new in our
politi-</p>
<p>cal history. But for the first time in a hundred years there is a
flood of</p>
<p>books-and by serious students of American government-advocating</p>
<p>radical constitutional reform. However much Senator Fulbright,
Henry</p>
<p>Hazlitt, and Thomas Finletter disagree on details, they are one
in</p>
<p>demanding the elimination–or at least the limitation–of the “rule
of</p>
<p>he concurrent majority“ and its replacement by an ideological
system</p>
<p>functioning along parliamentary lines. More significant even may
be</p>
<p>Walter Reuther’s new unionism with its blend of traditional
pressure</p>
<p>actics and working-class, that is, ideological, programs and
aims.</p>
<p>Yet all these critics and reformers not only fail to ask
themselves</p>
<p>whether an ideological system of politics would really be any
better</p>
<p>equipped to cope with the great problems of today-and neither the</p>
<p>foreign nor the industrial policy of England, that most successful of
all</p>
<p>ideologically organized countries, looks any too successful right
now;</p>
<p>he critics also never stop to consider the unique strength of our</p>
<p>raditional system.</p>
<p>Our traditional system makes sure that there is always a
legitimate</p>
<p>government in the country; and to provide such a government is
the</p>
<p>first job of any political system-a duty which a great many of
the</p>
<p>political systems known to man have never discharged.</p>
<p>It minimizes conflicts by utilizing, rather than suppressing,
conflict-</p>
<p>ing forces. It makes it almost impossible for the major parties
to</p>
<p>become entirely irresponsible: neither party can afford to draw
strength</p>
<p>from the kind of demagogic opposition, without a governmental re-</p>
<p>sponsibility, which perpetually nurtures fascist and communist
parties</p>
<p>abroad. Hence, while the two national parties are willing to
embrace</p>
<p>any movement or any group in the country that commands sufficient</p>
<p>following, they in turn force every group to bring its demands
and</p>
<p>programs into agreement with the beliefs, traditions, and prejudices
of</p>
<p>he people.</p>
<p>Above all, our system of sectional and interest compromise is one
of</p>
<p>he only two ways known to man in which a free government and a
free</p>
<p>society can survive-and the only one at all adapted to the
conditions</p>
<p>of American life and acceptable to the American people.</p>
<p>The central problem in a free government is that of factions, as
we</p>
<p>have known since Plato and Aristotle. Logically, a free
government</p>
<p>and factions are incompatible. But whatever the cause-vanity and</p>
<p>pride, lust for power, virtue or wickedness, greed or the desire to
help</p>
<p>others-factionalism is inherent in human nature and in human
soci-</p>
<p>ety. For two thousand years the best minds in politics have tried
to</p>
<p>devise a factionless society-through education (Plato), through
elim-</p>
<p>ination of property (Thomas More), through concentration on the
life</p>
<p>of the spirit outside of worldly ambition (the political tradition
of</p>
<p>Lutheranism). The last great attempt to save freedom by
abolishing</p>
<p>faction was Rousseau’s. But to create the factionless free society is
as</p>
<p>hopeless as to set up perpetual motion. From Plato to Rousseau,</p>
<p>political thought had ended up by demanding that factions be sup-</p>
<p>pressed, that is, that freedom, to be preserved, be abolished.</p>
<p>The Anglo-American political tradition alone has succeeded in</p>
<p>breaking out of this vicious circle. Going back to Hooker and
Locke,</p>
<p>Calhoun’s Pluralism 29</p>
<p>building on the rich tradition of free government in the cities of
the late</p>
<p>Middle Ages, Anglo-American political realism discovered that if</p>
<p>factions cannot be suppressed, they must be utilized to make a
free</p>
<p>government both freer and stronger. This one basic concept
distin-</p>
<p>guishes Anglo-American political theory and practice from
continental</p>
<p>European politics and accounts for the singular success of free
and</p>
<p>popular governments in both countries. Elsewhere in the Western</p>
<p>world the choice has always been between extreme factionalism,</p>
<p>which makes government impotent if not impossible and inevitably</p>
<p>leads to civil war, and autocracy, which justifies the suppression
of</p>
<p>liberty with the need for effective and orderly government.
Nineteenth-</p>
<p>century France with its six revolutions, or near revolutions, stands
for</p>
<p>one, the totalitarian governments of our time for the other
alternative</p>
<p>of continental politics.</p>
<p>But-and this is the real discovery on which the Anglo-American</p>
<p>achievement rests-factions can be used constructively only if they
are</p>
<p>encompassed in a frame of unity. A free government on the basis
of</p>
<p>sectional interest groups is possible only when there is no
ideological</p>
<p>split in the country. This is the American solution. Another
conceiv-</p>
<p>able solution is to channel the driving forces, the vectors of
society,</p>
<p>into ideological factions which obtain their cohesion from a
program</p>
<p>for the whole of society and from a creed. But that presupposes
an</p>
<p>unquestioned ruling class with a common outlook on life, with
uniform</p>
<p>mores and traditional, if not inherent, economic security. Given
that</p>
<p>sort of ruling class, the antagonist in an ideological system can
be</p>
<p>expected to be a “loyal opposition,“ that is, to accept the rules of
the</p>
<p>game and to see himself as a partner rather than as a potential
chal-</p>
<p>lenger to civil war. But a ruling class accepted by the people as
a</p>
<p>whole, and feeling itself responsible to the people as a whole,
cannot</p>
<p>be created by fiat or overnight. In antiquity only Rome, in
modern</p>
<p>imes only England, achieved it. On the Continent, all attempts to</p>
<p>create a genuine ruling class have failed dismally.</p>
<p>In this country, the ruling-class solution was envisaged by Alex-</p>
<p>ander Hamilton and seemed close to realization under the presidents
of</p>
<p>he “Virginia Dynasty.“ Hamilton arrived at his concept with
inesca-</p>
<p>pable consistency; for he was absorbed by the search for a
foreign</p>
<p>policy and for the proper organization of an industrial
society-pre-</p>
<p>cisely the two problems which, as we have seen, pluralism is
least</p>
<p>equipped to resolve. But even if Hamilton had not made the fatal</p>
<p>mistake of identifying wealth with rulership, the American people</p>
<p>could not have accepted his thesis. A ruling class was
incompatible</p>
<p>with mass immigration and with the explosive territorial expansion
of</p>
<p>nineteenth-century America. It was even more incompatible with
the</p>
<p>American concept of equality. And there is no reason to believe
that</p>
<p>contemporary America is any more willing to accept Hamilton’s
con-</p>
<p>cept, Mr. James Burnham’s idea of the managerial elite
notwithstand-</p>
<p>ing. This country as a free country has no alternative, it seems, to
the</p>
<p>“rule of the concurrent majority,“ no alternative to sectional
pluralism</p>
<p>as the device through which factions can be made politically
effective.</p>
<p>It will be very difficult, indeed, to resolve the problems of
foreign</p>
<p>and of industrial policy on the pluralist basis and within the
interest-</p>
<p>group system, though not provsbly more difficult than these
problems</p>
<p>would be on another, ideological, basis. It will be all the harder as
the</p>
<p>wo problems are closely interrelated; for the effectiveness of
any</p>
<p>American foreign policy depends, in the last analysis, on our ability
to</p>
<p>show the world a successful and working model of an industrial</p>
<p>society. But if we succeed at all, it will be with the traditional
system,</p>
<p>horse trading, logrolling, and politicking all included. An old
saying</p>
<p>has it that this country lives simultaneously in a world of
Jeffersonian</p>
<p>beliefs and in one of Hamiltonian realities. Out of these two,
Cal-</p>
<p>houn’s concept of “the rule of the concurrent majority“ alone can</p>
<p>make one viable whole. The need for a formulated foreign policy
and</p>
<p>for a national policy of industrial order is real, but not more so
than the</p>
<p>need for a real understanding of this fundamental American fact:
the</p>
<p>pluralism of sectional and interest compromise is the warp of
Ameri-</p>
<p>ca’s political fabric; it cannot be plucked out without unraveling
the</p>
<p>whole.</p>
