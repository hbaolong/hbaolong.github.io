<h4 id="the-economic-basis-of-american-politics">The Economic Basis of
American Politics</h4>
<p>Why is there not only one single American among the “great</p>
<p>economists“? From its earliest days this country has had more
econo-</p>
<p>mists than any other country. It has led in the development of the
tools</p>
<p>of economic analysis. Economists are everywhere-in government, in</p>
<p>business, in the universities, in the labor unions. In no other
country,</p>
<p>indeed, is a knowledge of economics considered part of ordinary</p>
<p>education; in the United States, however, we have for many years
been</p>
<p>rying to combat “economic illiteracy“ in the secondary schools.
And</p>
<p>certainly there is no country in which popular interest in economics
is</p>
<p>great5r and in which economic issues are more prominent.</p>
<p>Yet we conspicuously lack the Great Economist, the economist who</p>
<p>changes our ideas about economics and gives us new approaches to
the</p>
<p>interpretation and direction of economic events.</p>
<p>Or, rather: the great economists America has produced are not</p>
<p>known as such, are not recognized as such. Alexander Hamilton and</p>
<p>Henry Clay certainly deserve being considered very great
economists:</p>
<p>Hamilton, at the very dawn of systematic economics, created a
basic</p>
<p>heory of economic development which has not been much improved</p>
<p>since; Henry Clay’s “American System“ is the font and origin of
all</p>
<p>welfare economics. Yet their very names are rarely mentioned in</p>
<p>histories of economic thought, whereas the German Friedrich List,</p>
<p>who repeated what Clay had taught him, usually occupies a
prominent</p>
<p>place in these books.</p>
<p>First published in The Public Interest, 1968</p>
<p>Of course, neither Hamilton nor Clay really wanted to be known as</p>
<p>an economist. Their own ambitions were elsewhere: Hamilton on</p>
<p>becoming the commanding general of a victorious United States</p>
<p>Army, Clay on being elected president. To both men, their
economics</p>
<p>were totally incidental to their politics and a tool thereof. For
both</p>
<p>Hamilton and Clay, economic policy was clearly a means to a
political</p>
<p>end. And when their economic views are discussed, they are
correctly</p>
<p>reated as part of their political theories and political
strategies.</p>
<p>The explanation for this state of affairs would seem to be this:</p>
<p>Economics is too important to American politics to be left to the</p>
<p>American economist. Economics has a political role to fulfill
that</p>
<p>ranscends its own subject matter. For well over two hundred years
it</p>
<p>has been the unifying impulse in this country’s political process.
Since</p>
<p>colonial days, “economic interests“ have been used systematically
to</p>
<p>create political forces and political alignments and, above all, to
unite</p>
<p>regional and sectional groups behind one leader and one program.
The</p>
<p>names of these economic interests have changed; but whether we
speak</p>
<p>of the “manufacturing interest,“ the “farming interest,“ or the
“sil-</p>
<p>ver bloc,’’ the idea itself has not changed. Similarly, for well over
two</p>
<p>centuries, economic issues-such as the tariff, the currency, or
free</p>
<p>soil-have been used to overcome and neutralize ideological
cleavages</p>
<p>and conflicts that otherwise might have torn apart the nation.
During</p>
<p>all of our history, fundamental rifts in the country have been
bridged</p>
<p>by polarizing politics on economic issues; these are issues on which
a</p>
<p>compromise, distributing dollars and cents, is always possible.
The</p>
<p>classical example is, of course, the compromise over the “Tariff
of</p>
<p>Abomination“ between the South and Andrew Jackson that postponed</p>
<p>he conflict over slavery for thirty years. All along it has been
good</p>
<p>American political manners to talk dollars and cents when we
really</p>
<p>mean political decisions. The way in which Robert McNamara, as</p>
<p>secretary of defense in both the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations,</p>
<p>used budgetary control radically to alter strategic concepts and
military</p>
<p>organization is another good example.</p>
<p>Perhaps most revealing is the way in which we have used the</p>
<p>economic sphere to think through and work out basic issues of the</p>
<p>relation of government to society. Big business is far more powerful
in</p>
<p>France or Germany, for instance, than it is in the United States.
But</p>
<p>only in the United States has the relationship between
“government</p>
<p>and business“ come to be considered the key issue for a
fundamental</p>
<p>The Economic Basis of American Politics 81</p>
<p>discussion of the role and power of government in society. Indeed,
our</p>
<p>public discussions for a century now have led many a naive
foreign</p>
<p>observer to conclude that in the United States there are no
noteworthy</p>
<p>social institutions other than business institutions.</p>
<p>The Great Themes of American History</p>
<p>The result of this peculiar role of economic issues and economic</p>
<p>controversy in the American political process is most paradoxical.
On</p>
<p>he one hand, economics in this country appears to be far more</p>
<p>prominent and far more important in the political life than in any
other</p>
<p>country. American history seems to be dominated, at first sight,
by</p>
<p>economic conflict. Indeed, it is possible to overlook the fact that
the</p>
<p>great themes of American history have all along been moral and</p>
<p>constitutional: slavery, the industrial versus the agrarian society,
and</p>
<p>federalism in the nineteenth century; racial equality, the role
and</p>
<p>function of the central government, and American’s place in an
inter-</p>
<p>national society in this century. In sharp contrast to countries
whose</p>
<p>politics have an ideological organization and pattern, such as
all</p>
<p>European countries, these great themes are barely mentioned in
day-to-</p>
<p>day, year-to-year American politics, where the slogans are
primarily</p>
<p>economic. It is, therefore, only too easy to mistake the appearance
for</p>
<p>reality. It is thus possible to argue, as a whole school of
historians did,</p>
<p>hat the Civil War was an “unnecessary conflict“ and could have
been</p>
<p>avoided by paying a few hundred million dollars to the slaveowners.
It</p>
<p>is possible, as Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., did in his brilliant Age
of</p>
<p>Jackson, to overlook completely that the central theme and the
crown-</p>
<p>ing achievement of the Jackson administration was to establish
the</p>
<p>sovereignty of the national government over all regional or
sectional</p>
<p>interests; instead, Mr. Schlesinger made economic and class
interests</p>
<p>paramount. It is even possible, as Charles Beard did in a long life
as a</p>
<p>historian, to see the whole of our history as determined by, and</p>
<p>subordinated to, economic interest. But Beard lived long enough
to</p>
<p>find out that any attempt to predict the course of American history
and</p>
<p>American political behavior from economics is bound to misfire.</p>
<p>Every American politician must, indeed, know how to use economic</p>
<p>measures for political ends. If he aspires to a national role, he
must be</p>
<p>a master of finding and creating economic alignments that unify
di-</p>
<p>verse groups across the nation. Even John C. Calhoun, the most
nearly</p>
<p>“metaphysical“ of our political thinkers, spent the last two decades
of</p>
<p>his life in an abortive attempt to bridge the moral gulf of
slavery</p>
<p>between South and West by means of their common economic interest</p>
<p>as farmers.</p>
<p>So it is that, despite its appearance of centrality, economics in
the</p>
<p>American experience is actually a subordinate means to
predominantly</p>
<p>noneconomic ends. Our values are not economic values, nor is our</p>
<p>economics autonomous. Politics even decides what economic issues</p>
<p>are allowed to appear on the stage of American history. For, to
be</p>
<p>“available“ as a political vehicle an economic issue must fit into
our</p>
<p>political logic. It must mobilize national energies and must unify
large</p>
<p>masses across regions for joint political action and for the conquest
of</p>
<p>he central political power that is the presidency.</p>
<p>This explains the absence of the Great Economist. Such a man must</p>
<p>assume the autonomy of the economic sphere in human life. He must</p>
<p>assume the reality of economic values. If he is interested at all
in</p>
<p>politics (as few of them were), he must treat politics as a
handmaiden</p>
<p>of economics and as a tool for achieving economic purposes. These</p>
<p>assumptions make no sense to the American experience. What flour-</p>
<p>ishes in this country, therefore, is economic technicians of skill
and</p>
<p>renown, economic analysts, and expert fashioners of economic
tools.</p>
<p>We have political economists and economic politicians galore. But
the</p>
<p>climate is most uncongenial to the Great Economist. Such a man
must</p>
<p>assume an autonomous economic reality, of which the political
issues</p>
<p>are merely a reflection. In our American experience, however,
eco-</p>
<p>nomics is the conventional shorthand and the lingua franca for
issues</p>
<p>and decisions which are not economic, but political and moral.
One</p>
<p>might, indeed, formulate a basic rule of American politics to read:
Zfat</p>
<p>all possible, express a political issue and design a political
alignment</p>
<p>as an economic issue and an economic alignment.</p>
<p>The insight that economic interests can be used as the hinge of</p>
<p>politics is commonly traced to the famous No. 10 of the
Federalist</p>
<p>Papers in which James Madison (following Harrington’s Oceana and</p>
<p>John Locke) concluded that power follows property. But, when Mad-</p>
<p>ison wrote, American political life had already, for a century,
been</p>
<p>habitually organized around economic issues and in economic
align-</p>
<p>The Economic Basis of American Politics 83</p>
<p>ments. Madison only codified what had been fairly general
American</p>
<p>experience during the colonial period.</p>
<p>Colonial legislatures had, indeed, no alternative if they wanted to
be</p>
<p>effective at all. The matters that now occupy a
legislature-public</p>
<p>order and law, the administration of justice or education-may
have</p>
<p>been of very great interest to them, but were normally not within
their</p>
<p>reach. They had, perforce, to be left to the individual local
commu-</p>
<p>nities, the towns and counties. In colonial America, distances were
too</p>
<p>great, population too sparsely settled, for any central authority to
be</p>
<p>effective. If the local community would not look after its own
internal</p>
<p>affairs, nobody else could. The major burning issue for the
colonial</p>
<p>legislature was relations with the mother country. And those turned
on</p>
<p>economic problems and economic questions: taxes and tariffs,
coinage</p>
<p>and credit, and so on. It was in these matters, above all, that
the</p>
<p>colony’s Royal Governor was interested; for in eighteenth-century</p>
<p>heory and practice, an overseas colony was an economic asset. Of</p>
<p>course, such recurrent disturbances as Indian risings or the
endemic</p>
<p>war with the French occupied a good deal of the time and attention
of</p>
<p>he colonial politician. But his main job was to represent the
colonist</p>
<p>before and against the economic power represented and exerted by
the</p>
<p>Governor. His very raison d’andandandandtrewas economic. And only by
identify-</p>
<p>ing and organizing economic interests could the
eighteenth-century</p>
<p>colonial politician create unity in the electorate he
represented-an</p>
<p>electorate which, as the century wore on, became increasingly
diver-</p>
<p>sified in its other characteristics (religious beliefs, ethnic
origins, and</p>
<p>so on). There never was much need to do for the
eighteenth-century</p>
<p>politician, in the state houses of Boston, Philadelphia, and
Williams-</p>
<p>burg, what Sir Lewis Namier had to do in our century for his
English</p>
<p>counterpart: to seek out and identify his economic affiliations
and</p>
<p>interests. That was the one fact about the politician in colonial
America</p>
<p>hat was always clear, evident, and known to everybody.</p>
<p>But to Madison-and to all the brilliant politicians who, in the
first</p>
<p>quarter-century of United States history, established the political
con-</p>
<p>ventions and the political processes for the infant country-should
be</p>
<p>given credit for one fundamental insight: Economic interests could
be</p>
<p>used to unify. They could be used to overcome the pernicious
“fac-</p>
<p>ions,“ the cleavage of society into ideological camps divided by
their</p>
<p>basic beliefs, which the founding fathers rightly feared as
incompatible</p>
<p>with nationhood and political stability.</p>
<p>The Uses of Economic Conflict</p>
<p>This is a political view of economics-a view which explains eco-</p>
<p>nomic events in terms of human behavior. This, more than anything</p>
<p>else, distinguishes the traditional American approach to
economics</p>
<p>from the approach of the economist. The economist understands the</p>
<p>behavior of commodities. And if he is naive (as our present-day
neo-</p>
<p>Keynesians tend to be), he believes that human beings behave as</p>
<p>commodities do. But even at his most profound and skeptical, he
is</p>
<p>likely to consider ordinary human behavior as economically
nonratio-</p>
<p>nal behavior. In fact, the economist has, all along, been either
sus-</p>
<p>picious or at the last contemptuous of the politician who, so it
seems to</p>
<p>him, subordinates the clear logic of economic rationality to the
murky</p>
<p>unreason of human emotions and vanities. From this starting point,
the</p>
<p>classical economists essentially arrived at a denial of politics. To
them</p>
<p>here was a pre-established harmony in the economic system, with</p>
<p>economic self-regulation automatically producing the optimum for
all</p>
<p>groups and classes in society. Marx himself was no less
contemptuous</p>
<p>of the politician: no longer accepting the classical doctrine of
harmony,</p>
<p>but instead accepting the reality of economic conflict, he
deduced</p>
<p>herefrom the inevitability, beyond any politician’s contriving, of
class</p>
<p>war and revolution.</p>
<p>The political economists of the American tradition never for one</p>
<p>moment believed in pre-established economic harmony. Economic</p>
<p>conflict was much too obvious for that. It had, after all,
characterized</p>
<p>relations between the infant colonies and the mother country,
cul-</p>
<p>minating finally in a violent upheaval of the political order in
the</p>
<p>Revolution. But at the same time, they saw in economic conflict
their</p>
<p>means to prevent the more dangerous ideological conflict. And
they</p>
<p>saw in economic conflict the means to establish order-not
harmony,</p>
<p>which they did not expect on this earth. Above all, they saw that</p>
<p>economic conflict was the one clash within the body politic that
could</p>
<p>be managed. It could be managed because economic interests are</p>
<p>divisible, whereas political or religious beliefs are not. One can
always</p>
<p>split an economic difference in two-and while half a loaf is
better</p>
<p>The Economic Basis of American Politics 85</p>
<p>han no bread, half a child, as King Solomon long ago perceived, is
no</p>
<p>good at all. The same goes for half a religion, half a philosophy,
or</p>
<p>half a political principle.</p>
<p>Above all, their experience, unique at that time and quite at
variance</p>
<p>with what “common sense“ would have taught elsewhere, had con-</p>
<p>vinced the founding fathers that, unlike all other cleavages,
economic</p>
<p>conflicts tend to become less acute with time. They may not be
self-</p>
<p>healing, but they are capable of amelioration. If the fight is over
“who</p>
<p>gets how much,“ then one can satisfy both sides if the amount</p>
<p>available for distribution increases. And their experience as
colonists</p>
<p>on the virgin continent had taught them that the economic pie is,</p>
<p>indeed, capable of being increased by human action, rather than
being</p>
<p>fixed forever.</p>
<p>They may not have consciously thought this through. But Alexander</p>
<p>Hamilton started out from the assumption that it is possible to
increase</p>
<p>he economic resources available. This assumption explains in
large</p>
<p>part why his countrymen, no matter how much they distrusted his</p>
<p>politics, took to his economics at once, but also why he never
attained</p>
<p>full respectability as an economist. For the economist
traditionally-</p>
<p>until well past World War 11-took it for granted that economic</p>
<p>resources are given and limited, so that the problem is their
most</p>
<p>effective distribution in a system of equilibrium. In this
respect</p>
<p>Keynes, however much he otherwise might have differed from his</p>
<p>predecessors, was as traditional as anyone. It was not until the
most</p>
<p>recent decades, until the advent of “economic development“ as a
goal</p>
<p>of economic policy-with President Truman’s “Point Four“ declara-</p>
<p>ion of the early 1950’s being the crucial date-that proper
economists</p>
<p>accepted the purposeful creation of dynamic disequilibrium as
possible</p>
<p>and meaningful.</p>
<p>To the American-no matter how faithfully he repeated the teach-</p>
<p>ings of the economist, no matter how faithfully he himself taught
them</p>
<p>in the classrooms of his colleges-it was obvious that in his
country</p>
<p>he economic resources had been proven to be capable of almost</p>
<p>infinite expansion through human and, in large measure, political</p>
<p>action. He may have agreed with the economist that this was purely
the</p>
<p>result of the rarest of accidents: the existence on this continent of
vast</p>
<p>areas of empty soil, ready for plow, ready to be appropriated and to
be</p>
<p>converted into an economic resource. But very early we find in
the</p>
<p>actual political behavior of the American strong evidence that,
deep</p>
<p>down, he knew differently. He knew what Hamilton had known in the</p>
<p>last decade of the eighteenth century: that there is an economic
dynam-</p>
<p>ic and that economic resources are the creation of man rather than
of</p>
<p>Providence. This underlies quite clearly such bold measures as
the</p>
<p>Morrill Act of 1865 which, in creating the land-grant colleges,
clearly</p>
<p>assumed that the application of knowledge creates economic values</p>
<p>and productive capacity well beyond that given in the existing
re-</p>
<p>sources. It underlay, from the beginning, all American
trade-union</p>
<p>movements. American “business unionism“ assumes not only that the</p>
<p>fight over the division of the pie is by itself likely to produce a
larger</p>
<p>pie-that, in other words, economic conflict by itself leads to
econom-</p>
<p>ic growth and therefore, at the same time, to political and social
unity.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that the American concept of “economic</p>
<p>interest“ as an effective and unifying political force has served
this</p>
<p>country exceedingly well.</p>
<p>In fact, it is questionable whether there could have been an
Ameri-</p>
<p>can nation without it. With the wisdom of hindsight, we have come
to</p>
<p>see in the frontier a source of strength. But, in reality, the
experience</p>
<p>of the frontier must have been an almost unbearable strain, as
witness</p>
<p>all other countries that have undergone a similar experience. It was
not</p>
<p>only the kind of strain on the physical resources and on the
political</p>
<p>energies which rapid, turbulent expansion produces. Above all, it
was</p>
<p>a strain on the unity of a country in which the new tidal wave of</p>
<p>immigrants of different social background, national origin, and
reli-</p>
<p>gious allegiance always arrived long before the preceding wave of</p>
<p>immigrants had been absorbed. In such a country, growing at a
frenetic</p>
<p>speed, ideological, philosophical, or religious cleavages might
have</p>
<p>been fatal.</p>
<p>One should not forget that the immigrants, by and large, had
them-</p>
<p>selves no tradition of self-government or even of political activity;
it</p>
<p>was not, after all, the respectable or well to do who arrived in the
holds</p>
<p>of the immigrant ships. And yet these vast heterogeneous masses
had</p>
<p>o become a nation under one government and with one set of basic</p>
<p>values practically overnight, or else the American experiment
would</p>
<p>have floundered. If economic interests had not been available as
the</p>
<p>political organizer, it would either have been necessary to impose
the</p>
<p>most rigid authority on the population or else pluralism would
have</p>
<p>The Economic Basis of American Politics 87</p>
<p>organized itself against the nation and its unity-with every
imported</p>
<p>radition of religion and culture, every imported political value
and</p>
<p>belief, the focus of an ideology alien, if not hostile, to
American</p>
<p>nationhood (as is so clearly the case in Latin America).</p>
<p>The great phenomenon of the nineteenth century is not, after all,
the</p>
<p>rise of the American economy. It is the creation of the American</p>
<p>nation. For a nation, as we are now finding out the world over, is
not</p>
<p>something one can easily create. It is, on the contrary, usually the
fruit</p>
<p>of long experience and of historical forces operating over many
centu-</p>
<p>ries. Neither the nations of Europe nor Japan were created
overnight.</p>
<p>That nationhood is difficult and takes a very long time to create
is</p>
<p>proven by the fact that, outside of these old nations-and of the
United</p>
<p>States-very few, if any, nations have yet come into being. In all
of</p>
<p>Latin America, for instance, despite centuries of political
identity,</p>
<p>only Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Brazil, can be said to be
“na-</p>
<p>ions“-and, in both, nationhood has come only in this century. But</p>
<p>he United States achieved nationhood in a few short decades, or,
at</p>
<p>he most, within a century. This it owes to a very large extent to
the</p>
<p>radition which used economic interests in their clashes and conflicts
as</p>
<p>he foundation for political issues, political alignments, and
political</p>
<p>conflicts. This has enabled the United States to tolerate, if not
to</p>
<p>encourage, pluralism in all other spheres, to survive the fiercest of
civil</p>
<p>wars, and to attain a unity of allegiance and of basic
commitments</p>
<p>which represent as strong a common bond and communion as
centuries</p>
<p>of common history, common language, and common experiences have</p>
<p>given to any of the older nations.</p>
<p>The Bias Toward “Bipartisanship“</p>
<p>But the convention of economic interests has not only tended to
pre-</p>
<p>vent ideological issues from arising. It has forced the American
politi-</p>
<p>cal system into a nonpartisan approach to noneconomic problems.</p>
<p>A noneconomic issue threatens the existing political alignments.
It</p>
<p>is not easily encompassed within the American political system.
The</p>
<p>American politician shuns ideological stands, for the simple
reason</p>
<p>hat they are certain to alienate a large proportion of a
constituency</p>
<p>brought together and held together by economic interests. Any
non-</p>
<p>economic ideological stand would have at once, for instance,
exploded</p>
<p>he alliance between the lily-white, fundamentalist Protestant,
and</p>
<p>proudly Anglo-Saxon South and the cosmopolitan, largely Catholic
or</p>
<p>Jewish working class in the big cities on which the Democratic
party</p>
<p>was based for so long. The only thing that could hold them
together-</p>
<p>and could thereby get a Democratic politician into federal
office-was</p>
<p>heir economic opposition to the manufacturing interest.</p>
<p>This built into the American political process a powerful incentive
to</p>
<p>handle noneconomic issues on a “bipartisan“ basis, that is, to
remove</p>
<p>hem essentially from party politics. Indeed, the greatest praise in
our</p>
<p>political system is reserved for the “patriot“ who turns a
potentially</p>
<p>disruptive noneconomic issue into bipartisan consensus. It is for
this</p>
<p>act of patriotism at the expense, legend has it, of his
presidential</p>
<p>chances that American history primarily remembers Henry Clay. And</p>
<p>a century later, Arthur Vandenberg earned himself a permanent
place</p>
<p>in the American political pantheon by similarly making American</p>
<p>foreign policy after World War I1 “bipartisan,“ thereby again
sacrific-</p>
<p>ing whatever chance for the Presidential nomination of his party
he</p>
<p>might ever have had. A great many voters repudiated Barry
Goldwater</p>
<p>in 1964, not because they disagreed with his views, but because
his</p>
<p>decision to take a partisan stand on noneconomic issues seemed to</p>
<p>hem a greater threat to the Republic than a wrong, but
bipartisan,</p>
<p>consensus on the issues. And, in the context of the American
political</p>
<p>process, they were right.</p>
<p>Foreign affairs, religion, education, civil rights, and a host of
other</p>
<p>areas which, in any other country, are the bread and meat of
party</p>
<p>politics and political organization are, therefore, as much as
possible,</p>
<p>reated as “bipartisan“ in the American political system. This does
not</p>
<p>mean that they are not controversial. It means that the system, as
long</p>
<p>as it works, uses them to bring together otherwise warring
factions</p>
<p>rather than to create new factions on each side of the controversy.
In</p>
<p>fact, we much prefer not even to tackle such issues unless there
is</p>
<p>available for them a broad coalition cutting across our
conventional</p>
<p>political alignments. Again and again, initiative in such an issue is
left,</p>
<p>as if by passive agreement, to the one body in the American
political</p>
<p>system that is outside the established party alignment, the
Supreme</p>
<p>Court. That in both the great constitutional issues of the recent
years,</p>
<p>civil rights and reapportionment of voting districts, a Supreme
Court</p>
<p>decision took the place of political action in these politically
crucial</p>
<p>areas was in full accord with the tradition that goes back to
John</p>
<p>The Economic Basis of American Politics 89</p>
<p>Marshall’s Court. For a Supreme Court decision is the “law of the</p>
<p>land“ and thus establishes its own consensus.</p>
<p>The Limitations of “Consensus“</p>
<p>There are obvious and real limitations to the effectiveness of
the</p>
<p>convention of economic issues in American politics. Not every</p>
<p>noneconomic-that is, ideological, political, or moral-issue can
be</p>
<p>either made to appear as economic or organized as “bipartisan.“</p>
<p>Indeed, the most important issues and decisions in the life of a
nation</p>
<p>cannot be handled in this fashion. The great example is slavery,
of</p>
<p>course, for in this country slavery did not primarily serve an
economic</p>
<p>function (as it did, for instance, in the plantation economy of
Brazil).</p>
<p>At least by the second quarter of the nineteenth century, the
main</p>
<p>function of slavery was to endow the “poor white“ in the South with
a</p>
<p>feeling of human superiority, no matter how wretched his physical
or</p>
<p>moral condition. Even if slavery in its origin and spread was an</p>
<p>economic institution, by the time it became an issue, that is, after
1820</p>
<p>or so, the main beneficiary was no longer the slave owner, but
rather</p>
<p>he nonowner who derived the psychic benefits of a slave society</p>
<p>without having to carry the increasing economic burden of
maintaining</p>
<p>he slaves. In other words, the Abolitionists, as we now know,
were</p>
<p>right: slavery in this country was a sin rather than a crime. And for
this</p>
<p>reason the abolition of slavery by itself, without true civil rights
for the</p>
<p>blacks, settled so very little.</p>
<p>And for this reason, too, slavery could not be camouflaged as an</p>
<p>economic issue, no matter how hard the politicians of the early
nine-</p>
<p>eenth century tried. Moreover, as a truly “irreconcilable“ issue,
that</p>
<p>is, as a spiritual and moral one, there could be no “consensus“ on
it,</p>
<p>even though the Supreme Court of the time tried to establish it in
the</p>
<p>Dred Scott decision. Nor could the existing political
organization</p>
<p>handle such a noneconomic issue-and probably the political system</p>
<p>of no country, no matter how organized, could have handled it. On
the</p>
<p>issue of slavery, then, the American political system floundered
and</p>
<p>sank into Civil War, almost destroying the country with it.</p>
<p>But even in less crucial and less sensitive areas, the American</p>
<p>political system is not geared to handling the noneconomic issue.
This</p>
<p>is particularly true whenever foreign policy cannot be organized on
the</p>
<p>basis of “consensus“ and “bipartisanship.“ Any such failure
leaves</p>
<p>deep and long-lasting scars. For any such failure endangers
national</p>
<p>cohesion. This was true of the War of 1812. It was true of the
bitter</p>
<p>foreign-policy conflict that preceded our entry into World War I.
But</p>
<p>for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the rift over foreign policy
in</p>
<p>he years before World War I1 might similarly have proven
incapable</p>
<p>of being organized within the American political system and might</p>
<p>have torn apart American national unity. Today, Vietnam poses a</p>
<p>similar threat.</p>
<p>But then there is also always a danger that our politicians may
forget</p>
<p>hat the economic issue is a convention and fall into the error of</p>
<p>believing that economics really controls politics. In domestic
affairs,</p>
<p>he danger is not very great. It is a very stupid politician who will
not</p>
<p>intuitively realize the limitations, as well as the uses, of the
conven-</p>
<p>ion. Certainly no strong president-Jackson, Lincoln, the two
Roose-</p>
<p>velts, or Truman, for example–ever believed that economic
interests</p>
<p>and economic policy were by themselves sufficient, or that they</p>
<p>necessarily prevailed. But in foreign affairs we have made this
mistake</p>
<p>again and again-and have paid dearly in every case. Again and
again</p>
<p>we have fallen for the illusion of “economic sanctions“ as an
effective</p>
<p>ool in foreign affairs. And again and again we have found that they
are</p>
<p>ineffective. This holds true for the belief of the South that
“King</p>
<p>Cotton“ would force the North to its knees and constrain Europe
to</p>
<p>ally itself with the Confederacy, but also for the balancing belief
of the</p>
<p>North that the Confederacy could be defeated by economic
blockade.</p>
<p>And we now also know, from the diaries of pro-Western Japanese</p>
<p>leaders, that the economic sanctions which the United States and
Great</p>
<p>Britain imposed on Japan in 1940 and 1941 only strengthened the
war</p>
<p>party and deprived the moderates of all influence, just as the
blockade</p>
<p>of Germany in World War I emasculated the moderates in the German</p>
<p>government and made the military extremists all-powerful.
Ironically,</p>
<p>we now also know that economic sanctions did not even work in the</p>
<p>one case in which they seemed to have been successful-the case</p>
<p>which probably explains the blind American belief in this policy:
the</p>
<p>“economic sanctions“ of the American colonists against the first</p>
<p>British attempt to tax them, a decade before the American Revolu-</p>
<p>ion. Recent historical research has made it reasonably certain that
the</p>
<p>The Economic Basis of American Politics 91</p>
<p>British Cabinet used the American boycott as an excuse for a
retreat</p>
<p>from a policy which had proven exceedingly unpopular among power-</p>
<p>ful backers at home, and not primarily for economic reasons.</p>
<p>The convention of economics as the ground of political action and</p>
<p>organization is, in other words, just a tool. Like every tool, it has
to be</p>
<p>used with judgment. And like every tool, it has limitations.
Whoever</p>
<p>mistakes the convention for reality pays the heavy penalty one
always</p>
<p>has to pay for deceiving oneself.</p>
<p>But while not perfect, not infallible, and not a panacea by any</p>
<p>means, the convention has served the American people remarkably</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>The question, however, is not really how well the convention has</p>
<p>served in the past. It is: is it still useful, still serviceable? Can
the</p>
<p>common, ordinary, political business of the American people still
be</p>
<p>ordered by the traditional rule to formulate issues, as far as
possible, as</p>
<p>economic issues and to define alignments, to the greatest extent
possi-</p>
<p>ble, as economic alignments?</p>
<p>It is just barely possible that this traditional convention of
domestic</p>
<p>American politics has a major future role to play in foreign and</p>
<p>international affairs. But at the same time, it may be at the end of
its</p>
<p>usefulness at home.</p>
<p>Every one of the many new countries that have come into existence</p>
<p>in the last two decades has yet to become a nation. Every one is
less</p>
<p>well equipped for this task, by history and tradition, than was
the</p>
<p>infant American Republic two hundred years ago. In every one, the</p>
<p>cleavages between tribes, between religions, between races, run</p>
<p>deep-and will have to be bridged fast if the country is to survive.
No</p>
<p>one of them could survive a conflict of ideologies. In this
situation, a</p>
<p>good many of them, if not all, will predictably take recourse in
the</p>
<p>elimination of politics-the vain promise of every dictatorship.
Equal-</p>
<p>ly predictably, this will only worsen the conflicts and make them
even</p>
<p>less tractable. Predictably also, some of them at least will seek
escape</p>
<p>in braggart nationalism, if not in conquest abroad. This, too,
history</p>
<p>amply teaches, will not succeed. Only an approach to politics
which</p>
<p>allows conflicts to be productive and to create unity across the
dividing</p>
<p>line of tribe, religion, tradition, or race would seem to fit the
needs of</p>
<p>he new countries. In the traditional American approach, which
makes</p>
<p>politics turn on economic interests and economic issues, the new</p>
<p>countries might well find what they need, ready-made and well
tested.</p>
<p>Indeed, this approach might become increasingly more important</p>
<p>for the international community altogether. The world today is
threat-</p>
<p>ened by a danger even greater than that of class war in the
nineteenth</p>
<p>century. It is threatened by the danger of a world-wide race war of
the</p>
<p>poor and largely colored majority against the largely white minority
of</p>
<p>he rich. At the same time, this is an infinitely smaller world than
was</p>
<p>hat of the eighteenth century-a world in which everybody is
every-</p>
<p>body else’s neighbor and in which, therefore, there is no alternative
to</p>
<p>living together. In such a world, a political concept which allows
for</p>
<p>productive conflict, but which also organizes unity beyond the
ideo-</p>
<p>logies and traditions that divide, might be of the greatest
importance.</p>
<p>We are obviously very far from any such accomplishment; the</p>
<p>“Alliance for Progress“ in President Kennedy’s original version
was</p>
<p>probably the closest to it. But, in retrospect, the development
efforts of</p>
<p>he 1950’s and 1960’s may well one day appear as the first
uncertain</p>
<p>and faltering steps toward a new, nonideological and yet unifying</p>
<p>concept of international order, different alike in its flexibility
and</p>
<p>effectiveness from the world anarchy of sovereign states which
has</p>
<p>become a hopeless anachronism, and a world government which, if
at</p>
<p>all feasible, could today be only a world-wide tyranny.</p>
<p>The Need for Innovation</p>
<p>But at the same time, it seems likely that in domestic politics
the</p>
<p>raditional economic convention has come to the end of its
usefulness.</p>
<p>It is not that we are dissatisfied with it or that we hanker after
ideologi-</p>
<p>cal politics. It’s just that the problems and challenges of American
life</p>
<p>no longer can be cast easily, if at all, into an economic mold. The
civil-</p>
<p>rights issue, in all likelihood, is typical of the issues that will
be central</p>
<p>o American politics from now on: the problems of the metropolis;
the</p>
<p>structure, values, and relationships of a society increasingly
organized</p>
<p>in large and powerful institutions; or the role, function, and
limitations</p>
<p>of science and technology. These questions cannot be converted
into</p>
<p>economic issues. Nor, despite President Johnson’s attempts at
“con-</p>
<p>sensus,“ are they likely to admit of “bipartisanship. “
Bipartisanship</p>
<p>The Economic Basis of American Politics 93</p>
<p>is effective when the answers are known, at least in broad outline.
But</p>
<p>great political innovations, such as we need, are rarely the children
of</p>
<p>compromise.</p>
<p>And yet these are also issues which the traditional ideological</p>
<p>alignments, the alignments of European politics, cannot tackle. To
do</p>
<p>as so many foreign and domestic critics of the American political</p>
<p>system have urged us to do for well over a century-to organize
our</p>
<p>political life on the basis of “liberal“ and “conservative,“ or
“right“</p>
<p>and “leftM-would only add to the confusion. What is “liberal“ in</p>
<p>respect to the government of the metropolis? Or in respect to the</p>
<p>relationship between the individual and the large organizations
on</p>
<p>which he depends for effectiveness, but on which he must not
depend</p>
<p>if he wants to be free? And what does it mean to be a
“conservative“</p>
<p>on these issues? There is obviously going to be violent disagreement
in</p>
<p>respect to these issues; in fact, there is need for such disagreement
and</p>
<p>for a diversity of approaches to their solution. But ideological
align-</p>
<p>ments are bound to be as irrelevant to these issues as the
traditional</p>
<p>alignment by economic interests. The “New Left“ is thus bound to
be</p>
<p>sterile and to be condemned to total frustration.</p>
<p>If, indeed, the world will permit us the luxury of domestic affairs
in</p>
<p>he next half-century or so, we will not only have to face up to
new</p>
<p>issues. We shall have to devise a new approach to domestic
politics</p>
<p>altogether. This signifies a greater upheaval in our political life,
a</p>
<p>greater strain on political sanity and stability, than the new
issues</p>
<p>hemselves could possibly mean and a greater opportunity for
creative</p>
<p>political thought and effective political leadership than this
country has</p>
<p>known since the days of the founding fathers.</p>
<p>In seizing this opportunity, we may well have to abandon the
tradi-</p>
<p>ional reliance on economic interests and economic issues as
symbols</p>
<p>of political intercourse and as means of political organization. I
hope</p>
<p>hat we will not give up with them the principle underlying them:
the</p>
<p>mobilization of conflict to create unity, and the appeal to
interest</p>
<p>against the fanaticism of ideological faction. It is not only a
civilized</p>
<p>concept; it is a principle that makes politics productive for the
common</p>
<p>good. It has served the American people well-so well that doing</p>
<p>without the Great Economist seems a very small price, indeed.</p>
