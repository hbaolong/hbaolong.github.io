<h4 id="the-american-genius-is-political">The American Genius Is
Political</h4>
<p>The genius of the American people is political. The one truly
saintly</p>
<p>figure this country has produced, the one name that symbolizes
the</p>
<p>“fulfilled life“ to most Americans, the one man whose very life
was</p>
<p>dedicated toward directing human activity onto a higher goal, was
a</p>
<p>politician: Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>The phrase which since early days expresses the essence of their</p>
<p>own society to Americans is a political promise: the “equal chance
of</p>
<p>every American boy to become President.“ One has only to
translate</p>
<p>he slogan-for instance, into a promise of “equal opportunity for</p>
<p>every boy to become Prime Ministerm-to see by contrast that it is</p>
<p>uniquely American, and this not because the promise of equal
oppor-</p>
<p>unities in itself would be absurd, but because the political sphere
is the</p>
<p>meaningful sphere of social values only in this country.</p>
<p>The American nation itself has been formed out of a multitude of</p>
<p>diverse national traditions not by imposing on the newcomer a
uniform</p>
<p>religion, uniform customs, a new culture-not even by imposing on</p>
<p>him the American language. It has been formed by imposing on him
a</p>
<p>common political creed. What makes the immigrant into an American</p>
<p>is an affirmation of abstract political principles, the oath of
citizenship</p>
<p>in which he promises to uphold “the republican form of
government.“</p>
<p>Above all, the meaning of this country-what it stands for for</p>
<p>Americans themselves as well as for the world-is a political
meaning.</p>
<p>First published in Perspectives, 1953.</p>
<p>It is a form of government, a social order, and an economic system
that</p>
<p>are equally in people’s minds when they praise America and when
they</p>
<p>condemn her. And when Americans sing of their own country, they</p>
<p>sing of her-in the words of our most popular anthem-as the “sweet</p>
<p>land of liberty,“ which would hardly occur as a definition of
one’s</p>
<p>country and as an avowal of one’s identification with it even to
the</p>
<p>most ardent of European liberals.</p>
<p>We have to go back all the way to the Rome of Augustus with its</p>
<p>concept of “Latinitas“ to find a society that so completely
understands</p>
<p>itself in political terms as does the United States. Yet Latinitas
was</p>
<p>wishful thinking and never became reality, whereas the political
mean-</p>
<p>ing of the United States furnishes its essence: its ideal
personality, its</p>
<p>promises, its power of integration and assimilation. That the
American</p>
<p>genius is political is therefore the major key to the understanding
of</p>
<p>America, of its history, and of its meaning.</p>
<p>In the political sphere lie the American ideas and institutions
which</p>
<p>are peculiar to this country and which give it its distinction.</p>
<p>There is, first, the peculiarly American symbiosis of secular
state</p>
<p>and religious society which is the cornerstone of the American
com-</p>
<p>monwealth. The United States today is both the oldest and the
most</p>
<p>horoughgoing secular state. It is also at the same time the only
society</p>
<p>in the West in which belief in a supernatural God is taken for
granted</p>
<p>and in which the traditional religious bodies, the churches, continue
to</p>
<p>discharge, unchallenged, many important community functions. And</p>
<p>his coincidence of secular state and religious society is not
simply</p>
<p>accidental. In the American mind the two serve as each other’s
main</p>
<p>support, if not as each other’s precondition. Everywhere else the</p>
<p>secular state arose out of a revolt against religion. In this country
the</p>
<p>secular state owes its existence largely to the demand of the leaders
of</p>
<p>dominant, indeed of established, religious creeds that civil power
and</p>
<p>religious society be strictly separated for the greater good of
religion</p>
<p>and church.</p>
<p>In the political sphere also lies the concept of
“constitutionalism“</p>
<p>which is the chief organizing principle of American society.
Constitu-</p>
<p>ionalism is much more than respect for law; that is something,
indeed,</p>
<p>The American Genius Is Political 7</p>
<p>for which the American is not renowned. Rather, constitutionalism is
a</p>
<p>view of the nature and function of abstract principles and of their
rela-</p>
<p>ionship to social action. It is a belief that power, to be
beneficial, must</p>
<p>be subjected to general and unchangeable rules. It is an assertion
that</p>
<p>ends and means cannot be meaningfully separated or considered
apart</p>
<p>from each other. It is a belief that the validity of actions can
be</p>
<p>determined by rational criteria. It is, in other words, a political
ethics.</p>
<p>The Constitution of the Republic is only one application of this
funda-</p>
<p>mental belief. Constitutionalism has been the organizing force in
every</p>
<p>one of our major institutions. Today, for instance, we see it at work
in</p>
<p>he industrial sphere fashioning a “common law“ in labor-manage-</p>
<p>ment relations and reinforcing such principles as “federalism“
and</p>
<p>“legitimate succession“ for management inside business
enterprise.</p>
<p>Peculiarly American also is the political view of education. This
is</p>
<p>shown in the insistence of Americans that education, on all levels,
be</p>
<p>equally accessible to all, if not, indeed, obligatory on all. It is
shown in</p>
<p>he nalve but general belief that the level of general schooling is
a</p>
<p>fairly reliable index of civic competence and that any increase in it
is a</p>
<p>step toward a better and fuller citizenship. Most characteristically,
the</p>
<p>political view of education is expressed in the definition of the
educa-</p>
<p>ional goal-the feature that makes understanding the American
school</p>
<p>system so difficult for the foreigner. American education rejects
alike</p>
<p>he traditionally European concept of the “educated individual“
and</p>
<p>he “trained robot“ of modem totalitarianism. To both it opposes
the</p>
<p>demand that the school has to educate responsible self-governing</p>
<p>citizens who, in Lincoln’s words, “do not want to be masters
because</p>
<p>hey do not want to be slaves.“ And because the American school is</p>
<p>both free from control by the central government and a central
political</p>
<p>institution, it is bound to be the subject of violent political
dispute</p>
<p>whenever this country examines the premises on which its society
and</p>
<p>government rest, as, for instance, during the early days of the
New</p>
<p>Deal and again today.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the American political party-which has but the</p>
<p>name in common with parties in the rest of the Western world. The</p>
<p>major purpose of the American party is not to express principles, but
to</p>
<p>provide at all times a functioning and a legitimate government. It
does</p>
<p>not express a political philosophy to the realization of which
govern-</p>
<p>mental power is to be directed. It expresses the need of the body
politic</p>
<p>for a strong, a national, and a unifying government. For these
reasons</p>
<p>no American party has survived unless it succeeded in appealing to
all</p>
<p>classes and conditions, that is, unless it succeeded in being
truly</p>
<p>nationwide-which explains why both parties always are moderate in</p>
<p>heir actions. No party has survived unless it could appeal at once
to</p>
<p>men on the extreme right and to men on the extreme left. This, in
turn,</p>
<p>explains why both parties always appeal to the extremists in
their</p>
<p>campaign oratory. And no party has survived unless it succeeded
in</p>
<p>sinking differences of interests and principles in the unifying
appeal of</p>
<p>a common American creed.</p>
<p>The real achievement of American history in the first half of
this</p>
<p>century also lay in the political sphere. It is an achievement so
great, so</p>
<p>recent, and still so much in a state of becoming as to be almost
beyond</p>
<p>our vision: the creation of a new industrial society with new
institu-</p>
<p>ions-and of an industrial society that promises to be a stable, a
free,</p>
<p>and a moral society.</p>
<p>We ourselves in this country are prone to discuss our industrial</p>
<p>achievements in economic, if not in purely technical, terms. But
every</p>
<p>single “productivity team“ which came to this country from Europe
in</p>
<p>he forties and fifties to study the causes of American productivity
soon</p>
<p>saw that economic and technological factors explain less than
nothing</p>
<p>about the American economy. The key to an understanding lies in
the</p>
<p>social beliefs and the new social and political institutions that we
have</p>
<p>developed since the turn of the century. The clue is to be found in
our</p>
<p>development of the corporation as an organization of joint human</p>
<p>efforts to a common goal, or in our new social organ, management,
the</p>
<p>function of which must be defined in sociopolitical terms, that is,
as</p>
<p>he organization and leadership of people.</p>
<p>More important even than any single one of these new
institutions-</p>
<p>more important even than such new ideas as productivity considered
as</p>
<p>a social responsibility of business, or the concept of the market
as</p>
<p>something that management through its own actions creates and ex-</p>
<p>pands-is the new American theorem as to the relationship between</p>
<p>business and society-a theorem as opposed to nineteenth-century</p>
<p>laissez-faire thinking as it is to nineteenth- and
twentieth-century</p>
<p>The American Genius Is Political 9</p>
<p>socialism. Business activity is no longer seen, as it was in
laissez-faire</p>
<p>heory, as something separate and distinct, without direct
relationship</p>
<p>o social and political goals. But it is also not seen, as in all
socialist</p>
<p>creeds, as something which, if it is to be in the public interest,
must be</p>
<p>controlled and perhaps suppressed by the government. Business
activ-</p>
<p>ity is seen as a necessarily private activity which, for its own good
and</p>
<p>its own justification, has to strive for the common good and the
stated</p>
<p>ends of society. Business enterprise is thus seen as local and
autono-</p>
<p>mous self-government which, by serving the ends of society, serves
its</p>
<p>own self-interests and guarantees its own survival. This, the
most</p>
<p>decisive contribution America has been making to the Western
world</p>
<p>hese last fifty years, is unquestionably a theorem of political
science.</p>
<p>In the political sphere, once more, lies that peculiarly American</p>
<p>form of behavior: voluntary group action. Perhaps nothing sets
this</p>
<p>country as much apart from the rest of the Western world as its
almost</p>
<p>instinctive reliance on voluntary, and often spontaneous, group
action</p>
<p>for the most important social purposes.</p>
<p>We hear a great deal of “American individualism“ these days. And</p>
<p>here is certainly a fundamental belief in the individual, his
strength,</p>
<p>his integrity and self-reliance, his worth in the American tradition.
But</p>
<p>his “individualism“ is much less peculiar to this country-and
much</p>
<p>less general-than its (usually overlooked) “collectivism.“ Only it
is</p>
<p>not the collectivism of organized governmental action from above. It
is</p>
<p>a collectivism of voluntary group action from below.</p>
<p>This shows itself in the way in which people in this country
tackle</p>
<p>heir social and community problems. If the teenagers in a small
town</p>
<p>get out of control, the local service club, Rotary or Lions, will
build a</p>
<p>clubhouse for them and get them off the streets. If the hospital
needs a</p>
<p>new wing, the Woman’s Club will get the money for it. American</p>
<p>schools are run as much by a voluntary group organization-the</p>
<p>Parent-Teacher Association-as they are by the Superintendent of</p>
<p>Schools. And when we suddenly have to draft millions of Americans</p>
<p>into uniform, we dump the social and community problems that this</p>
<p>creates into the lap of voluntary committees and organizations.
Even</p>
<p>he drafting of young men into the armed forces is left to
ordinary</p>
<p>citizens who volunteer to serve without compensation on the draft</p>
<p>boards of their communities.</p>
<p>Alone among Western countries, the United States knows no “Min-</p>
<p>istry of Education.“ But, then, no other country has anything to</p>
<p>compare with the power and influence that private groups–e.g.,
the</p>
<p>great foundations-wield over higher education. And yet we take
this</p>
<p>completely as a matter of course. Every American knows
instinctively</p>
<p>hat this country is actually ruled by thousands of purely
voluntary,</p>
<p>purely private, mostly local groups. He takes it for granted that it
is the</p>
<p>easiest thing in the world to get such a group going to meet any
local</p>
<p>needs whatsoever and that despite its private character it will
be</p>
<p>responsive to public opinion.</p>
<p>It is not “competition“ that characterizes American life, as some</p>
<p>social scientists want us to believe. It is the symbiosis between
compe-</p>
<p>ition and cooperation organized in and through voluntary, private</p>
<p>groups. And while the roots of this behavior reach deep into the
past-</p>
<p>in the brotherhoods of the members of the small religious sects and
in</p>
<p>heir interdependence, as well as in the neighborliness of the
frontier-</p>
<p>it is just as much at work in our newest institutions. No other
feature of</p>
<p>our business system is so much remarked upon by visiting manage-</p>
<p>ment and labor delegates from abroad as the close, highly
organized</p>
<p>cooperation on policy matters, on technology, on business
problems,</p>
<p>and so forth that obtains between the most bitter business rivals; or
the</p>
<p>close, constant cooperation on day-to-day problems that obtains
be-</p>
<p>ween managers and union officials in a given plant.</p>
<p>Americans themselves tend to take it for granted that American</p>
<p>genius is political. If they ask at all what explains this, their
answer is</p>
<p>likely to be: the frontier. Certainly the human explosion which
carried</p>
<p>settlement and civilization in less than one century from the
Atlantic</p>
<p>across a wild, hostile, and uncharted continent to the shores of
the</p>
<p>Pacific is the greatest achievement of the American people and
their</p>
<p>deepest experience. And yet the frontier and the course of
settlement</p>
<p>were themselves already results of the American political genius
rather</p>
<p>han its origins. It was the ability to organize spontaneously for
group</p>
<p>The American Genius Is Political 11</p>
<p>action, it was the idea of “constitutionalism,“ that made orderly</p>
<p>commonwealths out of the immigrant trains moving over the plains
or</p>
<p>mountains; it was the ability to adapt, as if instinctively,
inherited</p>
<p>patterns of social, political, and economic organization to the new
and</p>
<p>unexpected conditions of the frontier that alone made settlement of
the</p>
<p>country possible. Above all, the rapid settlement of the
continent</p>
<p>rested on the country’s ability to make, so to speak overnight,
Ameri-</p>
<p>cans out of millions of immigrants from all over Europe. This
presup-</p>
<p>posed the absorption of the alien into American citizenship and
his</p>
<p>integration into American political institutions.</p>
<p>The formative influence on America’s political spirit is
something</p>
<p>deeper than climate, geography, or even the experiences of our
histo-</p>
<p>ry. It consists in our fundamental beliefs regarding the nature of
man</p>
<p>and the nature of the universe. To say that the genius of this
country is</p>
<p>political is to say that America, from earliest colonial times,
has</p>
<p>refused to split the world of ideas from the world of matter, the
world</p>
<p>of reason from the world of the senses. It is to say that she has
alike</p>
<p>refused to grant more than a temporary visitor’s visa to the
philoso-</p>
<p>phies of Descartes, Hume, or the German Idealists as well as that
of</p>
<p>Marx-indeed, to the entire body of post-Cartesian philosophy on</p>
<p>which modem European thought is founded. For every one of these</p>
<p>philosophies denies meaning, if not existential reality, to the
sphere of</p>
<p>politics.</p>
<p>To the politician, matter can never be unreal, can never be an</p>
<p>illusion, can never be base. His task is to use matter for
constructive</p>
<p>purposes. Nor can he ever consider ideas illusory or unreal.
Without</p>
<p>hem he would have neither direction nor the ability to move
toward</p>
<p>his goal. The politician must always oppose to the “either-or“ of
the</p>
<p>monistic philosopher-whether idealist or materialist, realist or
nomi-</p>
<p>nalist, rationalist or intuitionist-the philosophical dualism of
“both.“</p>
<p>He can neither, with the European humanist, divorce “sordid“
politics</p>
<p>from “pure“ intellectual and artistic culture, nor can he, with
the</p>
<p>European materialist, see in politics simply a rationalization of
mate-</p>
<p>rial conditions or an automatic product of material forces. He can
be</p>
<p>neither “starry-eyed idealist“ and “uplifter“ nor the “money-mad</p>
<p>chaser of the almighty dollar.“ He must always combine elements
of</p>
<p>both extremes in the attempt to find balance and harmony. For to
the</p>
<p>politician ideas and matter are the two poles of a single world,
opposed</p>
<p>o each other but at the same time inseparable, mutually
interdepen-</p>
<p>dent, and each other’s complement.</p>
<p>America has insisted-at least since Jonathan Edwards first
started</p>
<p>philosophizing on these shores two hundred and fifty years
ago-that</p>
<p>ideas and matter, reason and experience, logic and intuition,
must</p>
<p>always be held equally real and equally valid. And it is this
philosophi-</p>
<p>cal world view that alone explains the central position of the
political</p>
<p>sphere in the American tradition.</p>
<p>In this view politics becomes at once a responsibility of man; it</p>
<p>becomes the chief moral duty in human life. Politics becomes a</p>
<p>respectable, in fact a creative, sphere of action-reative in the
aes-</p>
<p>hetic meaning of the word-“the endless adventure,“ as one eigh-</p>
<p>eenth-century politician called it; and creative in the spiritual
meaning</p>
<p>of the word, as partaking of charity through which man is moved
from</p>
<p>he pursuit of his own, empty self toward his real mission of
making</p>
<p>he creation glorify the creator. Politics as the creative, the
meaning-</p>
<p>ful, the moral, the responsible, the charitable sphere-that lies at
the</p>
<p>center of what America believes, what she has achieved, and what
she</p>
<p>stands for. The great men to whose memory she always turns in the</p>
<p>hours of darkness and confusion have been those few political
leaders</p>
<p>who realized to the full the opportunity and the obligation of
politics.</p>
<p>At bottom, the American philosophical position-the position that</p>
<p>believes in politics as the human activity through which matter is
made</p>
<p>o serve spirit-stands on a religious foundation. It is not incorrect
to</p>
<p>call it “Christian.“ But actually it is the great contribution of
Israel.</p>
<p>For it is in the Old Testament that the Lord looked upon his
material</p>
<p>creation and “saw that it was very good.“ Yet the creation is
nothing</p>
<p>without the Spirit that created it. And it is man’s specific task,
his own</p>
<p>mission and purpose, to make manifest the creator in and through
the</p>
<p>creation-to make matter express spirit.</p>
<p>The challenge that faces this country today is again primarily a</p>
<p>challenge of politics. There is, first, the challenge of the Welfare
State,</p>
<p>of maintaining a free society and a free government under the threat
of</p>
<p>an indefinite “cold war“ under the constant pressure of high
taxation,</p>
<p>The American Genius Is Political 13</p>
<p>he dangers of sneaking inflation, the tensions and worries of a
world</p>
<p>neither at peace nor at war.</p>
<p>There is the even greater challenge of the development of a
foreign</p>
<p>policy that is appropriate to America’s power and to her respon-</p>
<p>sibilities. This is doubly great a challenge since foreign policy is
the</p>
<p>one department of political action in which this country has failed
so</p>
<p>far. Ours is the third time that the United States has won
military</p>
<p>victory in a great war only to lose the peace almost immediately.</p>
<p>How we will meet these challenges will decide whether the Ameri-</p>
<p>can experiment has, after all, been nothing more than an episode in
the</p>
<p>suicidal Western civilization, or whether America will be capable
of</p>
<p>giving the West political inspiration leading it toward an age of</p>
<p>freedom, stable peace, and prosperity. And the outcome of the test
will</p>
<p>depend not primarily on America’s economic wealth or her military</p>
<p>strategy, but on her political leadership, her political wisdom,
her</p>
<p>political maturity. What is on trial today is America’s political
genius.</p>
