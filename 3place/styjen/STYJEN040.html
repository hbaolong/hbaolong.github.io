<h4 id="the-unfashionable-kierkegaard">The Unfashionable
Kierkegaard</h4>
<p>The Kierkegaard boom of the last few years is showing the first</p>
<p>signs of fatigue. For Kierkegaard’s sake I hope it will burst soon.
The</p>
<p>Kierkegaard of the literary boom is a fellow wit and fellow
modem,</p>
<p>distinguished from the other members of the smart set mainly by
his</p>
<p>having lived a hundred years earlier. But this Kierkegaard of the</p>
<p>psychologists, existentialists, and assorted ex-Marxists bears
hardly</p>
<p>any resemblance to the real Kierkegaard, who cared nothing for
psy-</p>
<p>chology or dialectics (save to show them to be inadequate and
irrele-</p>
<p>vant), but concerned himself solely with religious experience. And it
is</p>
<p>his real Kierkegaard who is meaningful for the modern world in
its</p>
<p>agony. We have neither saint nor poet to make whole the shards of
our</p>
<p>experience; in Kierkegaard we have at least a prophet.</p>
<p>Like all religious thinkers, Kierkegaard places in the center the</p>
<p>question, How is human existence possible?</p>
<p>All through the nineteenth century this question-which before had</p>
<p>been the core of Western thought-was not only highly
unfashionable;</p>
<p>it seemed senseless and irrelevant. The era was dominated by a</p>
<p>radically different question, How is society possible? Rousseau
asked</p>
<p>it; Hegel asked it; the classical economists asked it. Marx answered
it</p>
<p>one way; liberal Protestantism another way. But in whatever form it
is</p>
<p>asked, it must always lead to an answer which denies that human</p>
<p>existence is possible except in society.</p>
<p>First published in Sewanee Review, 1949</p>
<p>Rousseau formulated this answer for the whole era of progress:</p>
<p>whatever human existence there is; whatever freedom, rights, and</p>
<p>duties the individual has; whatever meaning there is in
individual</p>
<p>life-all is determined by society according to society’s objective
need</p>
<p>of survival. The individual, in other words, is not autonomous. He
is</p>
<p>determined by society. He is free only in matters that do not matter.
He</p>
<p>has rights only because society concedes them. He has a will only if
he</p>
<p>wills what society needs. His life has meaning only insofar as it
relates</p>
<p>o the social meaning and as it fulfills itself in fulfilling the
objective</p>
<p>goal of society. There is, in short, no human existence; there is
only</p>
<p>social existence. There is no individual; there is only the
citizen.</p>
<p>It is hardly possible to exaggerate the differences between Rous-</p>
<p>seau’s “General Will,“ Hegel’s concept of history as the unfolding
of</p>
<p>ideas, and the Marxian theory of the individual’s determination</p>
<p>hrough his objectively given class situation. But they all gave
the</p>
<p>same answer to the question of human existence: there is no such</p>
<p>hing, there is no such question! Ideas and citizens exist, but no
human</p>
<p>beings. What is possible is merely the realization of ideas in
and</p>
<p>hrough society.</p>
<p>For if you start with the question, How is society possible?,
without</p>
<p>asking at the same time, How is human existence possible?, you
arrive</p>
<p>inevitably at a negative concept of individual existence and of
free-</p>
<p>dom: individual freedom is then what does not disturb society.
Thus</p>
<p>freedom becomes something that has no function and no autonomous</p>
<p>existence of its own. It becomes a convenience, a matter of
political</p>
<p>strategy, or a demagogue’s catch phrase. It is nothing vital.</p>
<p>To define freedom as that which has no function is, however, to</p>
<p>deny the existence of freedom. For nothing survives in society save
it</p>
<p>have a function. But the nineteenth century believed itself far
too</p>
<p>secure in the possession of freedom to realize this. Prevailing
opinion</p>
<p>failed to see that to deny the relevance of the question, How is
human</p>
<p>existence possible?, is to deny the relevance of human freedom.
It</p>
<p>actually saw in the question, How is society possible?, a key to
the</p>
<p>gospel of freedom-largely because it aimed at social equality.
And</p>
<p>he break of the old fetters of inequality appeared equivalent to
the</p>
<p>establishment of freedom.</p>
<p>We now have learned that the nineteenth century was mistaken.</p>
<p>Nazism and Communism are an expensive education-a more expen-</p>
<p>The Unfashionable Kierkegaard 429</p>
<p>sive education, perhaps, than we can afford; but at least we are</p>
<p>learning that we cannot obtain freedom if we confine ourselves to
the</p>
<p>question, How is society possible? It may be true that human
existence</p>
<p>in freedom is not possible; which is, indeed, asserted by Hitler and
the</p>
<p>Communists as well as, less openly, by all those well-meaning
“social</p>
<p>engineers“ who believe in social psychology, propaganda,
re-educa-</p>
<p>ion, or administration as a means of molding and forming the
individ-</p>
<p>ual. But at least the question, How is human existence possible?,
can</p>
<p>no longer be regarded as irrelevant. For those who profess to believe
in</p>
<p>freedom, there is no more relevant inquiry.</p>
<p>I am not trying to say that Kierkegaard was the only thinker
during</p>
<p>he nineteenth century who saw the direction in which Rousseau was</p>
<p>leading the Western world. There were the Romanticists, some of</p>
<p>whom, especially in France, sensed what was coming. There was the</p>
<p>futile and suicidal revolt of Nietzsche-a Samson whose gigantic</p>
<p>power pulled down nothing but himself. There was, above all,
Balzac,</p>
<p>who analyzed a society in which human existence was no longer</p>
<p>possible and drew an Inferno more terrible than Dante’s in that there
is</p>
<p>not even a Purgatory above it. But although they all asked, How
is</p>
<p>human existence possible?, none but Kierkegaard answered.</p>
<p>Kierkegaard’s answer is simple: human existence is possible only
in</p>
<p>ension-in tension between man’s simultaneous life as an
individual</p>
<p>in the spirit and as a citizen in society. Kierkegaard expressed
the</p>
<p>fundamental tension in a good many ways throughout his writings-</p>
<p>most clearly and centrally when he described the tension as the
conse-</p>
<p>quence of man’s simultaneous existence in eternity and in time.
He</p>
<p>ook his formulation from St. Augustine; it is the intellectual climax
of</p>
<p>he Confessions. But Kierkegaard gave to the antithesis a meaning
that</p>
<p>goes far beyond St. Augustine’s speculation in dialectical logic.</p>
<p>Existence in time is existence as a citizen in this world. In time
we</p>
<p>eat and drink and sleep, fight for conquest or for our lives,
raise</p>
<p>children and societies, succeed or fail. But in time we also die. And
in</p>
<p>ime there is nothing left of us after our death. In time we do
not,</p>
<p>herefore, exist as individuals. We are only members of a species,</p>
<p>links in a chain of generations. The species has an autonomous life
in</p>
<p>ime, specific characteristics, an autonomous goal; but the member
has</p>
<p>no life, no characteristics, no aim outside the species. He exists
only in</p>
<p>and through the species. The chain has a beginning and an end,
but</p>
<p>each link serves only to tie the links of the past to the links of
the</p>
<p>future; outside the chain it is scrap iron. The wheel of time keeps
on</p>
<p>urning, but the cogs are replaceable and interchangeable. The
individ-</p>
<p>ual’s death does not end the species or society, but it ends his life
in</p>
<p>ime. Human existence is not possible in time; only society is
possible</p>
<p>in time.</p>
<p>In eternity, however, in the realm of the spirit, “in the sight
of</p>
<p>God,“ to use one of Kierkegaard’s favorite terms, it is society
which</p>
<p>does not exist, which is not possible. In eternity only the
individual</p>
<p>does exist. In eternity each individual is unique, he alone, all
alone,</p>
<p>without neighbors and friends, without wife and children, faces
the</p>
<p>spirit in himself. In time, in the sphere of society, no man begins
at the</p>
<p>beginning and ends at the end; each of us receives from those before
us</p>
<p>he inheritance of the ages, carries it for a tiny instant, to hand it
on to</p>
<p>hose after him. But in the spirit, each man is beginning and end.</p>
<p>Nothing his fathers have experienced can be of any help to him.
In</p>
<p>awful loneliness, in complete, unique singleness, he faces himself as
if</p>
<p>here were nothing in the entire universe but him and the spirit
in</p>
<p>himself. Human existence is thus existence on two l e v e l s ~ x i s
t e n c e</p>
<p>in tension.</p>
<p>It is impossible even to approximate eternity by piling up time;
mere</p>
<p>ime, even infinitely more time, will still only be time. And it is
also</p>
<p>impossible to reach time by subdividing eternity; eternity is
insepar-</p>
<p>able and immeasurable. Yet it is only as simultaneous existence
on</p>
<p>both planes, existence in the spirit and existence in society, that
human</p>
<p>existence is possible. St. Augustine had said that time is within</p>
<p>eternity, created by eternity, suspended in it. But Kierkegaard
knew</p>
<p>hat the two are on different planes, antithetic and incompatible
with</p>
<p>each other. And he knew it not only by logic and by introspection
but</p>
<p>by looking at the realities of nineteenth-century life.</p>
<p>It is this answer that constitutes the essential paradox of
religious</p>
<p>experience. To say that human existence is possible only in the
tension</p>
<p>between existence in eternity and existence in time is to say that
human</p>
<p>existence is only possible if it is impossible: what existence
requires on</p>
<p>he one level is forbidden by existence on the other. For example,</p>
<p>The Unfashionable Kierkegaard 431</p>
<p>existence in society requires that the society’s objective need
for</p>
<p>survival determine the functions and the actions of the citizen.
But</p>
<p>existence in the spirit is possible only if there is no law and no
rule</p>
<p>except that of the person, alone with himself and with his God.</p>
<p>Because man must exist in society, there can be no freedom except
in</p>
<p>matters that do not matter; but because man must exist in the
spirit,</p>
<p>here can be no social rule, no social constraint in matters that
do</p>
<p>matter. In society, man can exist only as a social being-as
husband,</p>
<p>father, child, neighbor, fellow citizen. In the spirit, man can exist
only</p>
<p>personally-alone, isolated, completely walled in by his own con-</p>
<p>sciousness.</p>
<p>Existence in society requires that man accept as real the sphere
of</p>
<p>social values and beliefs, rewards and punishments. But existence
in</p>
<p>he spirit, “in the sight of God,“ requires that man regard all
social</p>
<p>values and beliefs as pure deception, as vanity, as untrue, invalid,
and</p>
<p>unreal. Kierkegaard quotes from Luke 14:26, “If any man come to</p>
<p>me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children,
and</p>
<p>brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be
my</p>
<p>disciple.“ The Gospel of Love does not say: love these less than
you</p>
<p>love me; it says hate.</p>
<p>To say that human existence is possible only as simultaneous
exis-</p>
<p>ence in time and in eternity is thus to say that it is possible only
as one</p>
<p>crushed between two irreconcilable ethical absolutes. And that
means</p>
<p>(if it be more than the mockery of cruel gods): human existence
is</p>
<p>possible only as existence in tragedy. It is existence in fear
and</p>
<p>rembling; in dread and anxiety; and, above all, in despair.</p>
<p>This seems a very gloomy and pessimistic view of human existence</p>
<p>and one hardly worth having. To the nineteenth century it appeared
as</p>
<p>a pathological aberration. But let us see where the optimism of
the</p>
<p>nineteenth century leads to. For it is the analysis of this optimism
and</p>
<p>he prediction of its ultimate outcome that gave Kierkegaard’s work
its</p>
<p>vision.</p>
<p>It was the very essence of all nineteenth-century creeds that
eternity</p>
<p>can and will be reached in time; that truth can be established in
society</p>
<p>and through majority decision; that permanence can be obtained</p>
<p>hrough change. This is the belief in inevitable progress,
representative</p>
<p>of the nineteenth century and its very own contribution to human</p>
<p>hought. You may take the creed of progress in its most naIve and</p>
<p>herefore most engaging form-the confidence that man automatically</p>
<p>and through his very sojourn in time becomes better, more nearly</p>
<p>perfect, more closely approaches the divine. You may take the creed
in</p>
<p>its more sophisticated form-the dialectic schemes of Hegel and
Marx</p>
<p>in which truth unfolds itself in the synthesis between thesis and</p>
<p>antithesis, each synthesis becoming in turn the thesis of a new
dialecti-</p>
<p>cal integration on a higher and more nearly perfect level. Or you
may</p>
<p>ake the creed in the pseudo-scientific garb of the theory of
evolution</p>
<p>hrough natural selection. In each form it has the same substance:
a</p>
<p>fervent belief that by piling up time we shall attain eternity; by
piling</p>
<p>up matter we shall become spirit; by piling up change we shall
become</p>
<p>permanent; by piling up trial and error we shall find truth. For</p>
<p>Kierkegaard, the problem of the final value was one of
uncompromis-</p>
<p>ing conflict between contradictory qualities. For the nineteenth
centu-</p>
<p>ry, the problem was one of quantity.</p>
<p>Where Kierkegaard conceives the human situation as essentially</p>
<p>ragic, the nineteenth century overflowed with optimism. Not since
the</p>
<p>year 1000, when all Europe expected the Second Coming, has there</p>
<p>been a generation which saw itself so close to the fulfillment of
time as</p>
<p>did the men of the nineteenth century. Certainly there were
impurities</p>
<p>in the existing fabric of society. But the liberal confidently
expected</p>
<p>hem to be burnt away within a generation or, at the most, within
a</p>
<p>century by the daily strengthening light of reason. Progress was
auto-</p>
<p>matic. And though the forces of darkness and superstition might
seem</p>
<p>o gain at times, that was only a momentary illusion. “It is
always</p>
<p>darkest just before the dawn“ is a truly liberal maxim (and one,</p>
<p>incidentally, as false in its literal as in its metaphorical sense).
The</p>
<p>apogee of this naIve optimism was the book which the famous
German</p>
<p>biologist Ernst Haeckel wrote just before the turn of the
century-the</p>
<p>one which predicted that all the remaining questions would be
finally</p>
<p>and decisively answered within a generation by Darwinian biology
and</p>
<p>Newtonian physics. It is perhaps the best commentary on the fate
of</p>
<p>he nineteenth-century creed that Haeckel’s Weltraetsel sold by
the</p>
<p>millions in the generation of our grandfathers (and still hides out
on old</p>
<p>bookshelves) at the very moment when the universe of Darwinian</p>
<p>The Unfashionable Kierkegaard 433</p>
<p>biology and Newtonian physics was completely disintegrating.</p>
<p>To those whom the optimism of liberalism or Darwinism failed to</p>
<p>satisfy, Marx offered the more complicated but also infinitely
more</p>
<p>profound vision of a millennium that had to come precisely because
the</p>
<p>world was so corrupt and so imperfect. His was a truly
apocalyptic</p>
<p>message in which the impossible, the attainment of the permanent</p>
<p>perfection of the classless society, is promised precisely because it
is</p>
<p>impossible. In Marx the nineteenth-century optimism admits
defeat,</p>
<p>only to use defeat as a proof of certain victory.</p>
<p>In this creed of imminent perfection, in which every progress in
time</p>
<p>meant progress toward eternity, permanence, and truth, there was
no</p>
<p>room for tragedy (the conflict of two absolute forces, of two
absolute</p>
<p>laws). There was not even room for catastrophe. Everywhere in the</p>
<p>nineteenth-century tradition the tragic is exorcised, catastrophe
sup-</p>
<p>pressed. A good example is the attempt–quite popular these last
few</p>
<p>years-to explain so cataclysmic a phenomenon as Hitlerism in
terms</p>
<p>of “faulty psychological adjustment,“ that is, as something that
has</p>
<p>nothing to do with the spirit, but is exclusively a matter of
techniques.</p>
<p>Or, in a totally different sphere, compare Shakespeare’s Antony
and</p>
<p>Cleopatra with Flaubert’s Madame Bovary and see how the
essentially</p>
<p>ragic “eros“ becomes pure “sex“-psychology, physiology, even</p>
<p>passion, but no longer a tragic, that is, an insoluble, conflict. Or
one</p>
<p>might, as one of the triumphs of the attempt to suppress
catastrophe,</p>
<p>ake the early Communist explanation of Nazism as “just a
necessary</p>
<p>stage in the inevitable victory of the proletariat.“ There you have
in</p>
<p>purest form the official creed that whatever happens in time must
be</p>
<p>good, however evil it is. Neither catastrophe nor tragedy can
exist.</p>
<p>There has never been a century of Western history so far removed</p>
<p>from an awareness of the tragic as the one that bequeathed to us
two</p>
<p>world wars. Just over two hundred years ago–in 1755, to be exact-</p>
<p>he death of 15,000 people in the Lisbon earthquake was enough to</p>
<p>bring down the tottering structure of traditional Christian belief
in</p>
<p>Europe. The contemporaries could not make sense of it; they could
not</p>
<p>reconcile this horror with the concept of an all-merciful God;
they</p>
<p>could not see any answer to a paradox of catastrophe of such
magni-</p>
<p>ude. For years now we have learned daily of vastly greater
destruc-</p>
<p>ion, of whole peoples being starved or exterminated. And it is
far</p>
<p>more difficult to comprehend these man-made catastrophes in terms
of</p>
<p>our modem rationality than it was for the eighteenth century to
com-</p>
<p>prehend the earthquake of Lisbon in the terms of traditional
Chris-</p>
<p>ianity. Yet our own catastrophes make no impression on the
optimism</p>
<p>of those thousands of committees that are dedicated to the belief
that</p>
<p>permanent peace and prosperity will “inevitably“ issue from
today’s</p>
<p>horrors. To be sure, they are aware of the facts and duly outraged
by</p>
<p>hem. But they refuse to see them as catastrophes. They have been</p>
<p>rained to deny the existence of tragedy.</p>
<p>Yet however successful the nineteenth century was in suppressing</p>
<p>he tragic, there is one fact that could not be suppressed, one fact
that</p>
<p>remains outside of time: death. It is the one fact that cannot be
made</p>
<p>general, but remains unique; the one fact that cannot be socialized,
but</p>
<p>remains personal. The nineteenth century made every effort to
strip</p>
<p>death of its individual, unique, and qualitative aspect. It made
death an</p>
<p>incident in vital statistics, measurable quantitatively, predictable
ac-</p>
<p>cording to the actuarial laws of probability. It tried to get around
death</p>
<p>by organizing away its consequences. Life insurance is perhaps
the</p>
<p>most significant institution of nineteenth-century metaphysics;
its</p>
<p>proposition “to spread the risks“ shows most clearly the nature of
the</p>
<p>attempt to consider death an incident in human life rather than
its</p>
<p>ermination. And the nineteenth century invented spiritualism-an</p>
<p>attempt to control life after death by mechanical means.</p>
<p>Yet death persists. Society might make death taboo, might lay
down</p>
<p>he rule that it is bad manners to speak of death, might
substitute</p>
<p>“hygienic“ cremation for those horribly public funerals, and
might</p>
<p>call gravediggers morticians. The learned Professor Haeckel might</p>
<p>hint broadly that Darwinian biology is just about to make us live</p>
<p>permanently; but he did not make good his promise. And so long as</p>
<p>death persists, the individual remains with one pole of his
existence</p>
<p>outside of society and outside of time.</p>
<p>So long as death persists, the optimistic concept of life, the
belief</p>
<p>hat eternity can be reached through time and that the individual
can</p>
<p>fulfill himself in society, must have only one outcome–despair.</p>
<p>Suddenly every man finds himself facing death; and at this point he
is</p>
<p>all alone, all individual. If his existence is purely in society, he
is</p>
<p>The Unfashionable Kierkegaard 435</p>
<p>lost-for now this existence becomes meaningless. Kierkegaard
diag-</p>
<p>nosed the phenomenon and called it the “despair at not willing to be
an</p>
<p>individual.“ Superficially, the individual can recover from this
en-</p>
<p>counter with the problem of existence in eternity; he may even forget
it</p>
<p>for a while. But he can never regain his confidence in his existence
in</p>
<p>society. Basically he remains in despair.</p>
<p>Society must make it possible for man to die without despair if
it</p>
<p>wants him to be able to live exclusively in society. And it can do so
in</p>
<p>only one way: by making individual life meaningless. If you are</p>
<p>nothing but a leaf on the tree of the race, a cell in the body of
society,</p>
<p>hen your death is not really death; you had better call it a process
of</p>
<p>collective regeneration. But then, of course, your life is not a real
life</p>
<p>either; it is just a functional process within the life of the whole,
devoid</p>
<p>of any meaning except in terms of the whole. Thus, as Kierkegaard</p>
<p>foresaw a hundred years ago, an optimism that proclaims human</p>
<p>existence as existence in society leads straight to despair. And
this</p>
<p>despair can lead only to totalitarianism. For totalitarianism-and
that</p>
<p>is the trait that distinguishes it so sharply from the tyrannies of
the</p>
<p>past-is based on the affirmation of the meaninglessness of life and
of</p>
<p>he nonexistence of the person. Hence the emphasis in the
totalitarian</p>
<p>creed is not on how to live, but on how to die; to make death
bearable,</p>
<p>individual life had to be made worthless and meaningless. The
opti-</p>
<p>mistic creed, that started out by making life in this world mean</p>
<p>everything, led straight to the Nazi glorification of self-immolation
as</p>
<p>he only act in which man can meaningfully exist. Despair becomes
the</p>
<p>essence of life itself.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century arrived at the very point the pagan world
had</p>
<p>reached in the late Roman Empire. And like antiquity, it tried to
find a</p>
<p>way out by escaping into the purely ethical-by basing virtue on
man’s</p>
<p>reason. The great philosophical systems of German idealism-above</p>
<p>all Kant’s, but also Hegel’sAominated the age because they
identi-</p>
<p>fied reason with virtue and the good life. Ethical culture and that
brand</p>
<p>of liberal Protestantism that sees in Jesus the “best man that
ever</p>
<p>lived,“ with its slogans of the Golden Rule, of the “categorical</p>
<p>imperative,“ and of the satisfaction of serve-these and related
ethical</p>
<p>436 The Ecoiogical Vision</p>
<p>formulas became as familiar in the nineteenth century as most of
them</p>
<p>had been in antiquity. And they failed to provide a basis for
human</p>
<p>existence in modernity, just as they had failed two thousand
years</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>In its best representatives, the ethical concept leads, indeed,
to</p>
<p>moral integrity and moral greatness. Nineteenth-century humanism,</p>
<p>based half on Plutarch, half on Newton, could be a noble thing.
(We</p>
<p>have only to remember the great men of the last
nineteenth-century</p>
<p>generation, such as Woodrow Wilson, Masaryk, Jaurks, or Momm-</p>
<p>sen.) Kierkegaard himself was more attracted by it than he
realized.</p>
<p>Though fighting every inch of the way, he could never quite free</p>
<p>himself from the influence of Hegel; and Socrates, symbol of the</p>
<p>ethical life, remained to him the apogee of man’s natural
history.</p>
<p>But Kierkegaard also saw that the ethical concept, while it may
give</p>
<p>integrity, courage, and steadfastness, cannot give meaning-neither
to</p>
<p>life nor to death. All it can give is stoic resignation.
Kierkegaard</p>
<p>considered this position to be one of even greater despair than
the</p>
<p>optimistic one; he calls it “the despair at willing to be an
individual.“</p>
<p>And only too often the ethical position does not lead to anything
as</p>
<p>noble and as consistent as the Stoic philosophy, but turns into
sugar</p>
<p>coating on the pill of totalitarianism. This is, I feel, the position
of</p>
<p>many an apologist for Soviet Russia; he hopes that man will find</p>
<p>individual fulfillment in the ethical attempt at making his
neighbor</p>
<p>happy and that this will suffice to offset the reality of
totalitarianism.</p>
<p>Or the ethical position becomes pure sentimentalism-the position
of</p>
<p>hose who believe that evil can be abolished and harmony
established</p>
<p>by good intentions.</p>
<p>And in all cases the ethical position is bound to degenerate into</p>
<p>relativism. For if virtue is to be found in man, everything that
is</p>
<p>accepted by man must be virtue. Thus a position that starts out-as
did</p>
<p>Rousseau and Kant some two hundred years a g e t o establish man-</p>
<p>made ethical absolutes must end in the complete denial of
absolutes</p>
<p>and, with it, in the complete denial of the possibility of a truly
ethical</p>
<p>position. This way there is no escape from despair.</p>
<p>Is then the only conclusion that human existence can be only</p>
<p>existence in tragedy and despair? Are the sages of the East right
who</p>
<p>see the only answer in the destruction of self, in the submersion of
man</p>
<p>into the Nirvana, the nothingness?</p>
<p>The Unfashionable Kierkegaard 437</p>
<p>Kierkegaard has another answer: human existence is possible as</p>
<p>existence not in despair, as existence not in tragedy; it is possible
as</p>
<p>existence in faith. The opposite of Sin (to use the traditional term
for</p>
<p>existence purely in society) is not Virtue; it is Faith.</p>
<p>Faith is the belief that in God the impossible is possible, that in
Him</p>
<p>ime and eternity are one, that both life and death are meaningful.
Faith</p>
<p>is the knowledge that man is creature-not autonomous, not the</p>
<p>master, not the end, not the center-and yet responsible and free. It
is</p>
<p>he acceptance of man’s essential loneliness, to be overcome by
the</p>
<p>certainty that God is always with man, even “unto the hour of our</p>
<p>death. “</p>
<p>In my favorite among Kierkegaard’s books, a little volume called</p>
<p>Fear and Trembling, he raises the question: What distinguished</p>
<p>Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son, Isaac, from ordinary
mur-</p>
<p>der? If Abraham had never intended to go through with the
sacrifice,</p>
<p>but had intended all the time only to make a show of his obedience
to</p>
<p>God, then Abraham, indeed, would not have been a murderer, but he</p>
<p>would have been something more despicable: a fraud and a cheat. If
he</p>
<p>had not loved Isaac but had been indifferent, he would have been</p>
<p>willing to be a murderer. Yet Abraham was a holy man; God’s</p>
<p>command was for him an absolute command to be executed without</p>
<p>reservation; and we are told that he loved Isaac more than himself.
The</p>
<p>answer is that Abraham had faith. He believed that in God the
impos-</p>
<p>sible would become possible-and he could carry out God’s command</p>
<p>and yet retain Isaac.</p>
<p>Abraham was the symbol for Kierkegaard himself, and the sacrifice</p>
<p>of Isaac the symbol for his own innermost secret, his great and
tragic</p>
<p>love-a love he had slaughtered although he loved it more than he</p>
<p>loved himself. But the autobiographical allusion is only
incidental.</p>
<p>The story of Abraham is a universal symbol of human existence
which</p>
<p>is possible only in faith. In faith the individual becomes the
universal,</p>
<p>ceases to be isolated, becomes meaningful and absolute; hence in
faith</p>
<p>here is a true ethic. And in faith existence in society becomes
mean-</p>
<p>ingful, too, as existence in true charity.</p>
<p>The faith is not what today is so often glibly called a “mystical</p>
<p>experience“-something that can apparently be induced by the
proper</p>
<p>breathing exercises or by prolonged exposure to Bach. It can be</p>
<p>attained only through despair, through suffering, through painful
and</p>
<p>ceaseless struggle. It is not irrational, sentimental, emotional, or
spon-</p>
<p>aneous. It comes as the result of serious thinking and learning, of
rigid</p>
<p>discipline, of complete sobriety, of humbleness, and of the
self’s</p>
<p>subordination to a higher, an absolute will. The inner knowledge
of</p>
<p>one’s own unification in God-what St. Paul called hope and we
call</p>
<p>saintliness–only a few can attain. But every man is capable of
attain-</p>
<p>ing faith. For every man knows despair.</p>
<p>Kierkegaard stands squarely in the great Western tradition of
reli-</p>
<p>gious experience, the tradition of St. Augustine and
St. Bonaventure,</p>
<p>of Luther, St. John of the Cross, and Pascal. What sets him apart,
and</p>
<p>gives him this special urgency today, is his emphasis on the
meaning</p>
<p>of life in time and society for the man of faith, the Christian.</p>
<p>Kierkegaard is “modem,“ not because he employs the modern vocab-</p>
<p>ulary of psychology, aesthetics, and dialectics-the ephemeral
traits</p>
<p>which the Kierkegaard boom ballyhoos-but because he concerns</p>
<p>himself with the specific disease of the modem West: the falling
apart</p>
<p>of human existence, the denial of the simultaneity of life in the
spirit</p>
<p>and life in the flesh, the denial of the meaningfulness of each for
the</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>Instead, we have today a complete divorce, the juxtaposition of</p>
<p>“Yogi“ and “Commissarv-the terms are, of course, Arthur</p>
<p>Koestler’s-as mutually exclusive possibilities: an either-or
between</p>
<p>ime and eternity, charity and faith, in which one pole of man’s
dual</p>
<p>existence is made the absolute. This amounts to a complete
abdication</p>
<p>of faith: the “Commissar“ gives up the entire realm of the spirit for
the</p>
<p>sake of power and effectiveness; the “Yogi“ assigns human
existence</p>
<p>in time (that is, social life) to the devil and is willing to see
millions</p>
<p>lose their lives and their souls if only his own “I“ be saved. Both
are</p>
<p>impossible positions for any religious man to take, but especially
for a</p>
<p>Christian who must live in the spirit and yet must maintain that
true</p>
<p>faith is effective in and through charity (i.e., in and through
social</p>
<p>responsibility).</p>
<p>But at least both are honest positions, honestly admitting their</p>
<p>bankruptcy-in contrast to the attempt at evading the problem by
way</p>
<p>of the various “Christian“ political parties in Europe, Protestant
and</p>
<p>Catholic, or the movement for “Social Christianity“ still powerful
in</p>
<p>his country. For these attempts substitute morality and good
intentions</p>
<p>for faith and religious experience as mainsprings of action.
While</p>
<p>The Unfashionable Kierkegaard 439</p>
<p>sincere and earnest, while supported and sometimes led by good,
even</p>
<p>by saintly men, they must not only be as ineffectual in politics as
the</p>
<p>“Yogi“ but must also fail, like the “Commissar,“ to give
spiritual</p>
<p>life; for they compromise both life in time and life in eternity.
That</p>
<p>Austrian cleric and Catholic party leader who, in the thirties, came
out</p>
<p>for Hitler with the argument, “At least he is opposed to mixed</p>
<p>bathing,“ was a ghastly caricature of the Christian moralist in
politics;</p>
<p>but he caricatured something that is ever present where morality
is</p>
<p>confused with faith.</p>
<p>Kierkegaard offers no easy way out. Indeed it could be said of
him,</p>
<p>as of all religious thinkers who focus on experience rather than
on</p>
<p>reason and dogma, that he greatly overemphasizes life in the
spirit,</p>
<p>hus failing to integrate the two poles of human existence into
one</p>
<p>whole. But he not only saw the task; he also showed him his own
life</p>
<p>and in his works that there is no escape from the reality of
human</p>
<p>existence, which is one in tension. It is no accident that the only
part of</p>
<p>Kierkegaard’s tremendous literary output that did not originally
appear</p>
<p>under a pseudonym but under his own name was the Edifying Dis-</p>
<p>courses. Not that he wanted to conceal his authorship of the
other</p>
<p>works-the pseudonyms could not have fooled anybody; but the “edi-</p>
<p>fying“ books alone translate faith into social effectiveness and are
thus</p>
<p>ruly religious and not just “Yogi.“ It is also not an accident
that</p>
<p>Kierkegaard’s whole work, his twenty years of seclusion, of
writing,</p>
<p>hinking, praying, and suffering, were but the preparation for the</p>
<p>violent political action to which he dedicated the last months of
his</p>
<p>life-a furious one-man war on the established church of Denmark
and</p>
<p>its high clergy for confusing morality and tradition with charity
and</p>
<p>faith.</p>
<p>Though Kierkegaard’s faith cannot overcome the awful loneliness,</p>
<p>he isolation and dissonance of human existence, it can make it
bear-</p>
<p>able by making it meaningful. The philosophy of the totalitarian
creeds</p>
<p>enables man to die. It is dangerous to underestimate the strength
of</p>
<p>such a philosophy; for, in a time of sorrow and suffering, of
catastro-</p>
<p>phe and horror (that is, in our time), it is a great thing to be able
to die.</p>
<p>Yet it is not enough. Kierkegaard’s faith, too, enables man to die;
but</p>
<p>it also enables him to live.</p>
<p>Afterword:</p>
<p>Reflections of a Social Ecologist</p>
<p>When asked what I do, I say: “I write.“ Technically this is
correct.</p>
<p>Since I was twenty, writing has been the foundation of everything
else</p>
<p>I have been doing, such as teaching and consulting. And among my</p>
<p>wenty-five books there are two novels and one
quasi-autobiographical</p>
<p>volume of stories. Yet I certainly am not a “literary person“ and
have</p>
<p>never been mistaken for one.</p>
<p>But when people then ask: “What are you writing about?“, I</p>
<p>become evasive. I have written quite a bit about economics but
surely</p>
<p>am not an economist. I have written quite a bit about history but
surely</p>
<p>am not a historian. I have written quite a bit about government
and</p>
<p>politics; but though I started out as a political scientist I long
ago</p>
<p>moved out of the field. And I am also not a sociologist as the term
is</p>
<p>now defined. I myself, however, know very well-and have known</p>
<p>for many years-what I am trying to do. I consider myself a
“social</p>
<p>ecologist“ concerned with man’s man-made environment the way the</p>
<p>natural ecologist studies the biological environment. Even my two</p>
<p>novels, while pure fiction, are social ecology. The central character
in</p>
<p>one is European society before the First World War; the central</p>
<p>character in the other is an American Catholic university around
the</p>
<p>year 1980.</p>
<p>The term “social ecology“ is of my own coinage. But the
discipline</p>
<p>itself-and I consider it a discipline-boasts old and
distinguished</p>
<p>lineage. Its greatest document is Alexis de Tocqueville’s
Democracy</p>
<p>Written for this essay volume in 1992.</p>
<p>in America. I count among its leading practitioners another
French-</p>
<p>man, Bertrand de Jouvenel, two Germans, Ferdinand Toennies and</p>
<p>Georg Simmel, and three Americans, Henry Adams, John R. Com-</p>
<p>mons (whose “Institutional Economics“ was not too different from</p>
<p>what I call Social Ecology) and, above all, Thorstein Veblen.</p>
<p>But none of these is as close to me in temperament, concepts, and</p>
<p>approach as a mid-Victorian Englishman: Walter Bagehot. Living,
(as</p>
<p>I have lived) in an age of great social change-he died, aged
fifty-one,</p>
<p>in 1877-Bagehot first saw the emergence of new institutions:
civil</p>
<p>service and cabinet government as the cores of a functioning
democra-</p>
<p>cy, and banking as the center of a functioning economy. Similarly
I</p>
<p>was the first, a hundred years later, to identify management as the
new</p>
<p>social institution of the emerging society of organizations, and, a
little</p>
<p>later, to spot the emergence of knowledge as the new central
resource</p>
<p>and of knowledge workers as the new ruling class of a society that
is</p>
<p>not only “postindustrial“ but postsocialist and, increasingly,
post-</p>
<p>capitalist. Like Bagehot I see as central to society and to
civilization</p>
<p>he tension between the need for continuity (Bagehot called it
“the</p>
<p>cake of custom,“ I call it civilization) and the need for innovation
and</p>
<p>change. Thus, I know what Bagehot meant when he said that he saw</p>
<p>himself sometimes as a liberal Conservative and sometimes as a</p>
<p>conservative Liberal but never as a “conservative Conservative“ or
a</p>
<p>“liberal Liberal. “</p>
<p>The Themes</p>
<p>It was with the tension between continuity and change that my own</p>
<p>work began.</p>
<p>I was barely twenty at the time, in early 1930. I was then living
in</p>
<p>Frankfurt and working as foreign and financial writer for the
city’s</p>
<p>main afternoon paper. But I also attended law school at the
university</p>
<p>where I studied international relations and international law,
political</p>
<p>heory, and the history of legal institutions. The Nazis were not yet
in</p>
<p>power. Indeed reasonable people were quite sure that they would
never</p>
<p>get into power-I knew even at that time that they were likely to
be</p>
<p>wrong. All around me society, economy, and government-indeed</p>
<p>civilization-were collapsing. There was a total lack of
continuity.</p>
<p>Afterword: Reflections of a Social Ecologist 443</p>
<p>And this drew my attention to that remarkable trio of German</p>
<p>hinkers who in a similar period of social collapse, a little over
a</p>
<p>hundred years earlier, had created stability by inventing what came
to</p>
<p>be known as Der Rechtsstaat-the best translation of that
difficult</p>
<p>word may be the Justice State. They were a remarkable trio, both</p>
<p>because of the breadth of interests and activities of each of them,
but</p>
<p>also because they were respectively an agnostic Protestant, a
romantic</p>
<p>Catholic, and a converted Jew. The first of them, Wilhelm von
Hum-</p>
<p>boldt (1767-1835) was the last great figure of the European
Enlighten-</p>
<p>ment, a leading statesman during the Napoleonic Wars, the founder
of</p>
<p>he first modem university, the University of Berlin in 1809, and
later</p>
<p>he founder of scientific linguistics. The second, Joseph von
Radowitz</p>
<p>(1797-1853) was a professional soldier and the King’s confidant
and</p>
<p>first minister, but also a crusading magazine editor and the
progenitor</p>
<p>of all Catholic parties in Europe-in Germany, in France, in Italy,
in</p>
<p>Holland, in Belgium, in Austria.</p>
<p>The third and last, Friedrich Julius Stah1 (1802- 1861), was
Hegel’s</p>
<p>successor as professor of philosophy at the University of Berlin.
A</p>
<p>legal philosopher he also revived the moribund theology of
Lutheran</p>
<p>Protestantism. And he was the most brilliant parliamentarian, in
fact</p>
<p>he only brilliant parliamentarian in German history.</p>
<p>The three do not enjoy a good press. They are suspect precisely</p>
<p>because they tried to balance continuity and change, that is,
because</p>
<p>hey were neither unabashed liberals nor unabashed reactionaries.</p>
<p>They tried to create a stable society and a stable polity that
would</p>
<p>preserve the traditions of the past and yet make possible change,
and</p>
<p>indeed very rapid change. And they succeeded brilliantly. They
cre-</p>
<p>ated the only political theory that originated on the continent of
Europe</p>
<p>in modem times-at least until Karl Marx fifty years later. But
they</p>
<p>also created a political structure that survived for almost a
hundred</p>
<p>years, until it came crashing down with World War I.</p>
<p>Its failure, the inability to get the military under civilian
control-</p>
<p>he major cause of the collapse of nineteenth-century Europe-the</p>
<p>Rechtsstaat shared with all continental regimes, whether
democracies,</p>
<p>like the France of the Second Republic (as was demonstrated only
too</p>
<p>clearly in the Dreyfus Affair of 1896), or the absolute monarchy
of</p>
<p>he Russian T s a r - o r of course with the constitutional monarchy
of</p>
<p>Meiji Japan as well. During the entire nineteenth century only
English-</p>
<p>speaking countries succeeded in establishing civilian control of
the</p>
<p>military and with it civilian control of foreign policy.</p>
<p>Of course, Humboldt, Radowitz, and Stahl did not realize that
what</p>
<p>hey were trying to do had actually been accomplished in the
United</p>
<p>States. They did not realize that the United States Constitution
first and</p>
<p>so far practically alone among written constitutions, contains
explicit</p>
<p>provisions how to be changed. This probably explains more than</p>
<p>anything else why, alone of all written constitutions, the
American</p>
<p>Constitution is still in force and a living document. Even less did
they</p>
<p>realize the importance of the Supreme Court as the institution
which</p>
<p>basically represents both conservation and continuity, and
innovation</p>
<p>and change and balances the two.</p>
<p>But then nobody else in Europe has ever seen this. Tocqueville
did</p>
<p>not see this. Nor did Bagehot, otherwise a shrewd student of
America,</p>
<p>nor did Bryce in his monumental work on the American Common-</p>
<p>wealth. To this day, by the way, few people in Europe seem to</p>
<p>understand this. At least I have never been able to explain to
any</p>
<p>European the particular role of the Supreme Court-nor by the way</p>
<p>was Mr. Justice Holmes able to explain it to his great English
friend,</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Pollock, as witness their correspondence.</p>
<p>To a European it is simply axiomatic that an independent
judiciary</p>
<p>and a political role are incompatible and are in fact a contradiction
in</p>
<p>erms.</p>
<p>And I too, it should be said, had no inkling in 1930 that what
the</p>
<p>hree Germans in the early years of the nineteenth century had tried
to</p>
<p>accomplish had already been done, and far more successfully, by
the</p>
<p>Founding Fathers and by Chief Justice Marshall in the infant
United</p>
<p>States.</p>
<p>What Humboldt did was to balance two conserving institutions: a</p>
<p>professional and university-trained civil service and a
professional</p>
<p>army, with two innovating institutions: the research university
with</p>
<p>complete freedom of research, publishing, and teaching, and the
free-</p>
<p>market economy on Adam Smith’s prescription. The Monarch-a</p>
<p>strong executive, very similar to the way Humboldt saw George</p>
<p>Washington in far away America-would preside above the four and</p>
<p>would serve as the balancing wheel. And, to repeat, this worked for
a</p>
<p>Afterword: Reflections of a Social Ecologist 445</p>
<p>hundred years. While far from a “liberal democracyM-in fact there</p>
<p>was not even a parliament in Humboldt’s original formula-it put</p>
<p>king, civil service, and, at least in theory, the military under the
Law;</p>
<p>and at the same time it provided the foundation for the explosive
rise to</p>
<p>world leadership of the German university and of the Germany
econ-</p>
<p>omy.</p>
<p>The book on the three and on the Rechtsstaat became the first of</p>
<p>many, many books I should have written but did not write, or at
least</p>
<p>did not finish. The only part of it that was published was a
monograph</p>
<p>on Stahl-all of thirty-two printed pages. It was written during 1932
as</p>
<p>an anti-Nazi manifesto-for Stahl the great conservative had been
a</p>
<p>Jew. It was meant to make it impossible for the Nazis ever to have
any</p>
<p>use for me and for me ever to have any use for them. And it was
meant</p>
<p>also, in the event of a Nazi victory to be among the first books
they</p>
<p>would banish. It succeeded in its objectives. It was accepted by</p>
<p>Germany’s leading social science publisher, Mohr in Tuebingen,
and</p>
<p>published as Number 100 in the prestigious series on law and gov-</p>
<p>ernment-a singular honor for a totally unknown, twenty-three year</p>
<p>old. It came out-a pure coincidence, but still very much to my</p>
<p>delight-two weeks after Hitler and seized power in 1933-and it
was</p>
<p>promptly banned by the Nazis.</p>
<p>What made me abandon the work on the Rechsstaat was, of course,</p>
<p>he coming to power of the Nazis in Germany, and with it the failure
to</p>
<p>maintain any continuity. Out of this came my first major book The
End</p>
<p>of Economic Man (finished in 1937, published in early 1939). It</p>
<p>chronicles the collapse of a society that had lost all continuity and
all</p>
<p>belief, a society plunged into abject fear and despair. This was
then</p>
<p>followed by the Future of Industrial Man in 1942 in which I tried
to</p>
<p>develop social theory and social structure for an industrial
society</p>
<p>which can both conserve and innovate. This lead directly to my
work</p>
<p>on the analysis of the institution through which industrial society
gives</p>
<p>status and function and integrates individual efforts into common</p>
<p>achievement, Concept of the Corporation published in 1946.</p>
<p>But over the years I began to realize that change too has to be</p>
<p>managed. In fact, I came to realize that the only way in which an</p>
<p>institution, whether a government, a university, a business, a
labor</p>
<p>union, an army, can maintain continuity is by building
systematic,</p>
<p>organized, innovation into its very structure. This finally lead to
my</p>
<p>1986 book Innovation and Entrepreneurship which tries to develop
a</p>
<p>discipline of innovation as a systematic activity.</p>
<p>My concern with the tension between continuity and change as a</p>
<p>central polarity in society also led to a growing interest in
technology.</p>
<p>But even though I got to serve as president of the Society for
the</p>
<p>History of Technology, my interest has never been in technology
as</p>
<p>echnology. I became interested because I found that technology
has</p>
<p>never been integrated into the study of society. The technologists
look</p>
<p>upon technology as having to do with tools. Historians,
economists,</p>
<p>philosophers-excepting only Karl Marx and Joseph Schumpeter-see</p>
<p>echnology as a demonic force outside their universe and
perpetually</p>
<p>hreatening it. I see technology as a human activity in society. I
see</p>
<p>echnology in fact as Alfred Russell Wallace, a theorist of
evolution</p>
<p>and a contemporary of Charles Darwin saw it: “Man“ Wallace said,</p>
<p>“is the only animal capable of conscious evolution; he invents
tools.“</p>
<p>And it soon became obvious to me that work is a central factor in</p>
<p>shaping and molding society, social order, and community. In fact
to</p>
<p>me it became more and more clear that society is held in tension</p>
<p>between two poles, the pole of great ideas, especially of course
great</p>
<p>religious ideas, and the pole of how man works. To me therefore</p>
<p>echnology deals with how man works rather than with tools per se.</p>
<p>And so I began to think about a book tentatively entitled “A History
of</p>
<p>Work.“ It too is one of the many books I never wrote. But the
products</p>
<p>of this interest, a number of short papers on technology’s history
and</p>
<p>its characteristics, are included in this volume.</p>
<p>Out of the concern with the tension between continuity and change</p>
<p>came finally my interest in organizations. It became clear to me,</p>
<p>during the early days of World War 11, that we had moved or were</p>
<p>moving into a society of organizations in which major social tasks
are</p>
<p>being performed in and through managed institutions. The first one
to</p>
<p>attract my attention was the business enterprise-for the simple
reason</p>
<p>hat it was the institution through which the tasks of war-time
America</p>
<p>were being discharged, the institution which enabled America to
win</p>
<p>he war.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned my book Concept of the Corporation</p>
<ol start="1946" type="1">
<li>which was the first book to attempt the study of a major</li>
</ol>
<p>Afterword: Reflections of a Social Ecologist 447</p>
<p>enterprise-in this case the General Motors Corporation, then the</p>
<p>world’ premier manufacturing business and its most successful
one-</p>
<p>from the inside, as a social organization, and as one that
organizes</p>
<p>power, authority, responsibility, that is the tasks which always
had</p>
<p>been seen as tasks of governance if not of government. This book
was</p>
<p>hen followed in 1949 by Landmarks of Tomorrow-and ten years later</p>
<p>by The New Society. In The New Society I first talked of a society
of</p>
<p>organizations but also of knowledge work and knowledge worker as</p>
<p>becoming the new social and economic centers. Fifteen years later
I</p>
<p>hen commented on another major change in the society of organiza-</p>
<p>ion in a 1976 book (reprinted in the Transaction series under the
title</p>
<p>The Pension Fund Revolution); the original title was The Unseen</p>
<p>Revolution.</p>
<p>When I began to study organizations in the 1940s everybody,</p>
<p>including myself, saw only two: government, the old one, and
busi-</p>
<p>ness enterprise, the new one. By the late 1940s I myself had
already</p>
<p>begun to work actively with nonprofit institutions, for example,
hospi-</p>
<p>als. But I did so as something ordinary decency demanded of a</p>
<p>citizen. I did it as an act of charity in other words. It slowly
dawned on</p>
<p>me-I must admit very slowly-that these institutions were of
impor-</p>
<p>ance in their own right and particularly in America. It gradually</p>
<p>dawned on me that this “third sector“ is fundamentally distinct
from</p>
<p>both government and business. Government commands; it tries to</p>
<p>obtain compliance. Business supplies; it tries to get paid. The
nonprof-</p>
<p>it institutions however are human-change agents. Their “product“
is</p>
<p>neither compliance nor a sale. It is a patient who leaves the
hospital</p>
<p>cured. It is a student who has learned something. It is a
churchgoer</p>
<p>whose life is being changed.</p>
<p>In addition, as I learned, gradually these institutions discharge
a</p>
<p>second and equally important task in American society: they
provide</p>
<p>effective citizenship. In modern society direct citizenship is no
longer</p>
<p>possible. All we can do is vote and pay taxes. As volunteers in
the</p>
<p>nonprofit institutions we are again citizens. We again have an
impact</p>
<p>on social order, social values, social behavior, social vision. We
have</p>
<p>social results. It is thus the nonprofit institution which
increasingly</p>
<p>creates citizenship and community. And in the United States every</p>
<p>other adult by 1990 had come to work as a “volunteer“ in a
nonprofit</p>
<p>institution, on average three hours a week. And so increasingly I
began</p>
<p>o work with the nonprofit sector as a major constituent of
society-the</p>
<p>end result was my 1990 book Managing the Non-Profit Organization.</p>
<p>But long before that, of course, I had begun to study the manage-</p>
<p>ment of organizations-at first of the business enterprise and then
of</p>
<p>organizations altogether-in my various management books, begin-</p>
<p>ning with my 1954 Practice of Management leading to the first
book</p>
<p>on what is now called strategy: Managing for Results (1964), then
the</p>
<p>Effective Executive (1966), an attempt to project what had been
known</p>
<p>from Plato to Machiavelli as “the education of the ruler“ into
“the</p>
<p>education of the executive in the organization.“ In 1973 I then
put</p>
<p>ogether twenty years of management work in a big book Manage-</p>
<p>ment, Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices.</p>
<p>The focus of my early work, the work from the 1930s until the
early</p>
<p>1960s, was on the new social phenomenon, the organization, its</p>
<p>structure, its constitution, its management, its functions. But I
knew</p>
<p>myself from the early days to be out of sympathy with the basic
trend</p>
<p>of my times, the trend towards centralization, towards monolithic</p>
<p>society and towards government omnipotence.</p>
<p>This trend had its origin in World War I which was as much a</p>
<p>riumph of the civilian bureaucracy as it was an abject failure of</p>
<p>military leadership. The Western world came out of World War I</p>
<p>convinced of its ability to predict the future and to make it
through</p>
<p>planning. It came out of it with the belief that there was no limit
to</p>
<p>government’s ability to tax and therefore to government’s ability
to</p>
<p>spend–of all the lessons of World War I this was probably the
most</p>
<p>deleterious one. And it came out with the conviction that
government</p>
<p>could do and in fact should do everything. Everybody believes
that</p>
<p>democracies and totalitarian regimes had nothing in common in the</p>
<p>seventy years between 1920 and the collapse of communism. This is</p>
<p>half-truth only. Both shared the belief in centralization and
govern-</p>
<p>ment, a belief that probably reached its peak during the Kennedy
years</p>
<p>in the United States. Indeed the belief was so prevalent that
Stalinism,</p>
<p>hat most traditional of oriental despotisms, could wrap itself in
the</p>
<p>cloak of being “progressive“ and indeed “revolutionary“ by waving</p>
<p>he banner of planning, of state control, of total centralization.</p>
<p>Of course, there was always opposition. But the opposition did
not</p>
<p>as a rule question the competence and ability of government to do</p>
<p>Afterword: Reflections of a Social Ecologist 449</p>
<p>everything and to be everything. It questioned the wisdom of doing
so.</p>
<p>When Friedrich von Hayek (1899-1991) in 1944 published The Road</p>
<p>o Serfdom-and thereby started what we now call neoconservatism-</p>
<p>he pointed out that socialist government must be a tyranny. But he
did</p>
<p>not question its ability to perform politically or economically (he
did</p>
<p>his only more than forty years later in his 1988 book The Fatal</p>
<p>Conceit by which time the total incompetence, political, social,
moral,</p>
<p>economic, of socialist regimes had become clear to everybody).</p>
<p>In other words for five decades we asked what should government</p>
<p>do? Very few people, if any, asked what can government do.</p>
<p>To me this question became, however, a central question fairly</p>
<p>early. I probably owe this also to my interest in those German
liberal</p>
<p>conservatives (or conservative liberals), Humboldt, Radowitz, and</p>
<p>Stahl. For Humboldt, while a very young man, barely twenty-five,
and</p>
<p>living as a student in the Paris of the French Revolution, had
written a</p>
<p>little book called The Limits of the Effectiveness of Government
(Die</p>
<p>Grenzen der Wirksamkeit des Staates)-which however was not pub-</p>
<p>lished during his lifetime, being much too unfashionable even then.
I</p>
<p>began to ask the same question: what are the limits of
government’s</p>
<p>effectiveness? in the early years after World War I1 and began to ask
it</p>
<p>with increasing urgency as we went into the Eisenhower
administra-</p>
<p>ion. I first raised it obliquely in my 1959 book Landmarks of
Tomor-</p>
<p>row and then head-on, in my 1969 book The Age of Discontinuity. It
is</p>
<p>a central theme of my 1989 book The New Realities and is being</p>
<p>discussed in considerable depths in a chapter entitled “the
Megastate</p>
<p>and Its Failure7’ in a book I am presently (1992) working on,
ten-</p>
<p>atively entitled The Post-Capitalist Society.</p>
<p>And thus my work began to embrace both the political and the
social</p>
<p>institutions of modern society.</p>
<p>By the late 1950s another major theme had begun to appear in my</p>
<p>work: the emergence of knowledge as central resource, and of the</p>
<p>knowledge society (a word I coined in the late 1950s). The
characteris-</p>
<p>ics of knowledge-and it is totally different from any other resource
in</p>
<p>society and economy-the responsibilities of knowledge; the place
and</p>
<p>function of the knowledge worker; and the productivity of
knowledge</p>
<p>work, are themes discussed in my writing, and in a good many of
the</p>
<p>articles in this volume.</p>
<p>Finally there is one continuing theme, from my earliest to my
latest</p>
<p>book: the freedom, the dignity, the status of the person in
modern</p>
<p>society, the role and function of organization as instrument of
human</p>
<p>achievement, human growth and human fulfillment, and the need of</p>
<p>he individual for both, society and community.</p>
<p>The Work of the Social Ecologist</p>
<p>If social ecology is a discipline, it not only has its own
subject</p>
<p>matter. It also has its own work-at least for me. But it is easier to
say</p>
<p>what the work is not than to be specific about what it consists
of.</p>
<p>I am often called a “futurist.“ But if there is one thing I am
not+</p>
<p>one thing a social ecologist must not be-it is a “futurist.“ In the
firSt</p>
<p>place it is futile to try to foresee the future. This is not given to
mortal</p>
<p>man. And the idea that ignorance and uncertainty become vision by</p>
<p>being put into a computer is not a particularly intelligent one.
One</p>
<p>problem is that the things the most brilliant and most successful</p>
<p>predictor never predicts are always the things that are more
important</p>
<p>han the things he does predict. Futurists, always measure their
batting</p>
<p>average by how many of things they have predicted came true. They</p>
<p>never count how many of the important things that came true they
did</p>
<p>not predict.</p>
<p>A good example is the most successful futurist in recorded
history,</p>
<p>he French science fiction writer Jules Verne (1828-1905). Most of
the</p>
<p>echnologies he predicted have come true. But he-probably quite</p>
<p>unconsciously-assumed that society and economy would remain</p>
<p>what they were around 1870-and the changes in society and economy</p>
<p>have, of course, been at least as important as the new
inventions.</p>
<p>But also, and more important, the work of the social ecologist is
to</p>
<p>identify the changes that have already happened. The important
chal-</p>
<p>lenge in society, economy, politics is to exploit the changes that
have</p>
<p>already occurred and to use them as opportunities. The important
thing</p>
<p>is to identify the “Future That Has Already Happened“-the
tentative</p>
<p>itle of another book which I did not write, a book which was
intended</p>
<p>o develop the methodology for perceiving and analyzing these</p>
<p>changes which had happened-and irreversibly so-but which had not</p>
<p>yet had a impact, and were indeed not yet generally seen.</p>
<p>One example is my identifying around 1960 the social and
industrial</p>
<p>Afterword: Reflections of a Social Ecologist 451</p>
<p>urnaround which had already occurred in Japan and which, within</p>
<p>another ten years, propelled Japan into the first rank of
economic</p>
<p>powers. It was not hard to do so; one only had to look. But nobody
else</p>
<p>looked at that time. (While I did not write the “The Future That
Has</p>
<p>Already Happened,“ I incorporated a good deal of the material
into</p>
<p>my 1986 book Innovation and Entrepreneurship which shows how one</p>
<p>systematically looks to the changes in society, in demographics,
in</p>
<p>meaning, in science and technology, as opportunities to make the</p>
<p>future.)</p>
<p>While I am wrongly acclaimed as a “futurist,“ I am equally wrong-</p>
<p>ly criticized for not being a quantifier. Actually I am an old
quantifier.</p>
<p>In 1929, not yet twenty, I published one of the first econometric</p>
<p>studies. Like so much of this work it proceeded from a
self-evident</p>
<p>assumption by means of impeccable mathematics to an asinine
conclu-</p>
<p>sion to whit that the New York Stock Market could go only one
way,</p>
<p>hat is up. The way such things go, this paper appeared in a
highly</p>
<p>prestigious economic journal in August or September of 1929, just
a</p>
<p>few weeks before the event which I had just proven to be “imposs-</p>
<p>ible,“ actually occurred-that is a few weeks before the October
1929</p>
<p>Stock Exchange Crash (fortunately, there is no copy of the journal
left,</p>
<p>at least not in my possession). It was the last prediction, by the
way, I</p>
<p>allowed myself to indulge in. But I also taught statistics at one
time,</p>
<p>and helped organize the first operations research departments in
Amer-</p>
<p>ican industry (in GE and the Bell Telephone System), and thus can</p>
<p>hardly be accused of being unfamiliar with quantitative methods.</p>
<p>But quantification is scaffolding rather than the building itself.
And</p>
<p>one removes the scaffolding when the building is finished. More</p>
<p>important, quantification for most of the phenomena in a social
ecol-</p>
<p>ogy is misleading or at best useless. The data are much too
poor-as</p>
<p>he great mathematician and methodologist of quantification, Oskar</p>
<p>von Morgenstern (1902-1977) showed in his 1950 book On the Accu-</p>
<p>racy of Economic Observation. Moreover, most of the socioeconomic</p>
<p>figures we use in the United States (gross national product for
instance,</p>
<p>balance of payments, occupational classifications in the census,
and</p>
<p>many more) are based on aggregates developed in the 1920s, and</p>
<p>especially in the U.S. Department of Commerce while Herbert
Hoover</p>
<p>was its secretary from 1924-1928. And it is a rule in social and</p>
<p>economic statistics that aggregates if more than thirty or forty
years old</p>
<p>are highly suspect; they must be assumed to be outdated.</p>
<p>But the most important reason why I am not a quantifier is that
in</p>
<p>social and affairs, the event that matters cannot be quantified. It
is the</p>
<p>unique event that changes the statistical “universe“ and with it what
is</p>
<p>“normal distribution. “</p>
<p>One example is Henry Ford’s ignorance in 1900 or 1903 of the</p>
<p>prevailing economic wisdom according to which the way to maximize</p>
<p>profit is to be a monopolist, that is to keep production low and
prices</p>
<p>high. Instead of which he assumed-foolishly according to his
partners</p>
<p>and to the other people who had invested in his business-that the
way</p>
<p>o make money was to keep prices low and production high. This,
the</p>
<p>invention of “mass production,“ totally changed industrial eco-</p>
<p>nomics-though a good many economists still have not heard of it.
It</p>
<p>would have been impossible, however, to quantify the impact even
as</p>
<p>late as 1918 or 1920, that is a full ten years after Ford’s success
had</p>
<p>made him the richest industrialist in the United States (and probably
in</p>
<p>he world), had revolutionized industrial production, the
automobile</p>
<p>industry and the economy altogether, and had, above all, totally</p>
<p>changed our perception of industry.</p>
<p>The unique event that changes the universe is an event “at the</p>
<p>margin.“ By the time it becomes statistically significant, it is
no</p>
<p>longer “future“ it is indeed no longer even “present.“ It is
already</p>
<p>“past.“</p>
<p>To quantify social events that make a difference we would need a</p>
<p>mathematics that was first called for by the seventeenth-century
philos-</p>
<p>opher and mathematician Gottfried Leibnitz-the co-inventer of the</p>
<p>calculus. He spoke of a “calculus of relevance,“ that is of a
calculus</p>
<p>of qualitative change. But nobody even responded to the challenge
for</p>
<p>250 years until John Maynard Keynes in his first major work. A</p>
<p>Treatise on Probability (191 1) tried to develop the statistics of
the</p>
<p>unique event-totally without success as he himself later
admitted.</p>
<p>New mathematical theories now promise to define the probability
of</p>
<p>he unique event. But so far there is not even the slightest sign of
a</p>
<p>quantitative method to identify and to define the unique event, that
is</p>
<p>of a quantitative method to show changes in meaning.</p>
<p>And until such a quantitative method is developed-if it ever
will-</p>
<p>Afterword: Reflections of a Social Ecologist 453</p>
<p>he social ecologist has to use qualitative means to find and
assess</p>
<p>qualitative change. This, however, is not “guesswork.“ It is not</p>
<p>“hunch.“ It has to be a rigorous method of looking, of identifying,
of</p>
<p>esting-what such a method has to be I tried to develop, at least
in</p>
<p>rough outline, in my 1986 book Innovation and Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Now as to what the work of the social ecologist is or should be,
at</p>
<p>least for me.</p>
<p>First of all, it means looking at society and community with the</p>
<p>question: What changes have already happened that do not fit
“what</p>
<p>everybody knows;“ what are the “paradigm changes, “ to use the
now</p>
<p>popular term? The next question: Is there any evidence that this is
a</p>
<p>change and not a fad? The best test: Are there results of this
change?</p>
<p>Does it make a difference, in other words? And, finally, one then
asks:</p>
<p>If this change is relevant and meaningful, what opportunities does
it</p>
<p>offer?</p>
<p>A simple example would be the emergence of knowledge as a key</p>
<p>resource. For me, the decisive change, the event that alerted me
that</p>
<p>something was happening, was the GI Bill of Rights in the United</p>
<p>States after World War 11. This bill gave every returning veteran
the</p>
<p>right to attend college with the government paying the bill. It was
a</p>
<p>otally unprecedented development. In retrospect it is easy to see
that it</p>
<p>was the GI Bills of Rights that ushered in the knowledge society.
But</p>
<p>nobody saw it in this light in 1947 or 1948. I, however, asked myself
a</p>
<p>simple question: “If there had been such a Bill of Rights after
World</p>
<p>War I, would it have had an impact? Would many people have taken</p>
<p>advantage of it?“ It did not of course occur to anybody in
1918-less</p>
<p>han thirty years before the post-World War I1 bill-to offer such
a</p>
<p>veteran’s benefit, though 1918 America was as generous to its
veterans</p>
<p>as 1946 America, if not more so. But if such a bill had been offered
in</p>
<p>1919 and had passed the Congress-a most unlikely assumption-</p>
<p>practically nobody would have taken advantage of it. Then going
to</p>
<p>college was not seen as a meaningful opportunity for anyone but
the</p>
<p>children of the wealthy who did not need a GI Bill of Rights, or for
a</p>
<p>few who were so talented that their poverty did not matter.
Universal</p>
<p>high school education became meaningful after World War I;
universal</p>
<p>college education would have been meaningless then.</p>
<p>This then led to the question, “What impact does this have on</p>
<p>expectations, on values, on social structure, on employment, and
so</p>
<p>on?“ And once this question was asked-and I first asked it in the
late</p>
<p>1940s-it became at once clear that knowledge had attained a
position</p>
<p>in society and as a productive resource which it had never had before
in</p>
<p>human history. It became very clear that we were on the threshold of
a</p>
<p>major change.</p>
<p>Ten years later, that is by the mid-fifties, this had become so
clear</p>
<p>hat one could with confidence talk of a “knowledge society,“ of</p>
<p>“knowledge work“ as the new center of the economy, and of the</p>
<p>“knowledge worker“ as the new work force and the one in the</p>
<p>ascendant.</p>
<p>The next thing to say about the work of social ecologist is that
he</p>
<p>must aim at impact. His goal is not knowledge; it is right action. In
that</p>
<p>sense social ecology is a practice-as is medicine, or law, or for
that</p>
<p>matter the ecology of the physical universe. Its aim is to maintain
the</p>
<p>balance between continuity and conservation on the one hand, and</p>
<p>change and innovation on the other. Its aim is to create a society
in</p>
<p>dynamic disequilibrium. Only such a society has stability and
indeed</p>
<p>has cohesion.</p>
<p>This implies, however, that the social ecologist has a
responsibility</p>
<p>o make his work easily accessible. It rules out being “erudite.“
In</p>
<p>fact, in social ecology being “erudite“ is incompatible with, and
the</p>
<p>foe of, being “learned.“ The conceit that science is not “science,“
is</p>
<p>in fact not “respectable“ unless it is unaccessible, is
obscurantism.</p>
<p>Before World War I1 the first-rate scholars in America, and
especially</p>
<p>scholars in the social and political sciences, wrote for the
educated</p>
<p>layman-as did the first rate historians of that day, as did Reinhold
and</p>
<p>Richard Niebuhr both, Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict, and even</p>
<p>he economists of that day, and the psychologists. Max Weber wrote</p>
<p>simply, clearly, and accessibly and published in magazines for
the</p>
<p>laity and even in the daily press-and so did Thorstein Veblen.</p>
<p>In 1927 a French philosopher, Julien Benda (1867-1956), published</p>
<p>La Trahison de Clerks (The Treason of the Intellectuals), a
blistering</p>
<p>attack on the intellectuals of his day who for fashion’s sake
betrayed</p>
<p>heir duty and embraced racism and demagoguery, whether Nazism or</p>
<p>Communism. The following decades then amply proved Benda’s</p>
<p>criticism-by the willingness of intellectuals all over Europe-and
not</p>
<p>Afterword: Reflections of a Social Ecologist 455</p>
<p>just in Germany-to support Hitler, and equally by their willingness
to</p>
<p>support if not to idolize, Stalin.</p>
<p>I consider the obscurantism of today’s intellectuals equally to
be</p>
<p>betrayal and treason. In large part they bear the blame for the
debase-</p>
<p>ment of culture, especially in the United States. The
intellectuals</p>
<p>hemselves plead that the laity has lost receptivity to knowledge,
to</p>
<p>science, to discourse and to reason. But this is simply not true.</p>
<p>Whenever a scholar deigns to write decent prose he or she
immediately</p>
<p>finds a wide audience. I myself am an example. But so was Barbara</p>
<p>Tuchman, among historians, Rachel Carson or Loren Eisele among</p>
<p>ecologists of the physical universe, Irving Louis Horowitz among</p>
<p>sociologists, and a good many others. The receptivity is there, and
so</p>
<p>is the need. What today passes for scholarship is nothing but
arro-</p>
<p>gance.</p>
<p>This arrogance is least justifiable for a social ecologist. His job
is</p>
<p>not to create knowledge. It is to create vision. He has to be an</p>
<p>educator.</p>
<p>Finally, the work of the social ecologist requires, I am
convinced,</p>
<p>respect for language.</p>
<p>I would have respected language regardless of my field. The
Vienna</p>
<p>in which I was born in 1909 was extremely language-conscious.
With</p>
<p>his 1899 book Zur Kritik der Sprache (The Critique of Language),
an</p>
<p>Austrian, Fritz Mautner (1849-1923), founded what we now call the</p>
<p>philosophy of language. His book was in the library of every
educated</p>
<p>Viennese-as it was on the bookshelf of my home. Mautner first</p>
<p>pointed out that language is not “message.“ It is not “medium.“ It
is</p>
<p>meaning as well. In fact, Ludwig Wittgenstein is Mautner’s heir,
and,</p>
<p>so to speak, Mautner’s testamentary executor-most of what is in</p>
<p>Wittgenstein Mautner had groped for forty and fifty years earlier.
But</p>
<p>hen, the Vienna in which I grew up, was also the home of Karl
Kraus</p>
<p>(1874- 1936), arguably the greatest master of the German language
in</p>
<p>his century. And for Kraus language was morality. Language was</p>
<p>integrity. To corrupt language was to corrupt society and
individual</p>
<p>alike.</p>
<p>I thus grew up in an atmosphere in which language was taken</p>
<p>seriously. And then at nineteen and a trainee in an export firm
in</p>
<p>Hamburg, I encountered Kierkegaard-then still almost unknown out-</p>
<p>side his native Denmark, and largely untranslated. The preface to
my</p>
<p>essay on Kierkegaard in this volume recounts the impact of this</p>
<p>experience on me, my work, and my life. And Kierkegaard preached</p>
<p>he sanctity of language. For Kierkegaard, language is aesthetics
and</p>
<p>aesthetics is morality. Long before George Orwell I therefore
knew</p>
<p>hat the corruption of language is the tool of the tyrant. It is both
a sin</p>
<p>and a crime.</p>
<p>For the social ecologist, language is however doubly important.
For</p>
<p>language is in itself social ecology. For the social ecologist
language is</p>
<p>not “communication.“ It is not just “message.“ It is substance. It
is</p>
<p>he cement that holds humanity together. It creates community and</p>
<p>communion. Thus I always thought that the social ecologist has a</p>
<p>responsibility to language. Social ecologists need not be
“great7’</p>
<p>writers; but they have to be respectful writers, caring writers.</p>
<p>The Discipline</p>
<p>I called social ecology a “discipline.“ I did not call it a
“science.“</p>
<p>Indeed I would be quite uncomfortable if anyone spoke of social</p>
<p>ecology as a science. It is as different from any of the social
sciences as</p>
<p>he ecology of the physical universe is different from any of the</p>
<p>physical sciences.</p>
<p>“Zum Sehen Geboren; Zum Schauen Bestellt“</p>
<p>(Born to See; Meant to Look)</p>
<p>sings the look-out in Goethe’s Faust. This, I think, is the motto of
the</p>
<p>social ecologist and of social ecology as a discipline. It is based
on</p>
<p>looking rather than on analysis. It is based on perception. This,
I</p>
<p>submit, distinguishes it from what is normally meant by a science. It
is</p>
<p>not only that it can not be reductionist. By definition it deals
with</p>
<p>configurations. They may not be greater than the sums of their
parts.</p>
<p>But they are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>But also social ecology as a discipline deals with action.
Knowledge</p>
<p>is a tool to action rather than an end in itself. Social Ecology, as
I said</p>
<p>before, is a “practice.“</p>
<p>Afterword: Reflections of a Social Ecologist 457</p>
<p>Finally, social ecology is not “value free. “ If it is a science at
all, it</p>
<p>is a “moral science“-to use an old term that has been out of
fashion</p>
<p>for 200 years. The physical ecologist believes, must believe, in
the</p>
<p>sanctity of natural creation. The social ecologist believes, must
be-</p>
<p>lieve, in the sanctity of spiritual creation.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of talk today about “empowering people.“</p>
<p>This is a term I have never used and never will use. Fundamental to
the</p>
<p>discipline of social ecology, as I see it, is not a belief in power.
It is the</p>
<p>belief in responsibility, in authority grounded in competence, and
in</p>
<p>compassion.</p>
