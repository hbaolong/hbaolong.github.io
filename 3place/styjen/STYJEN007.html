<h4 id="the-myth-of-american-uniformity">The Myth of American
Uniformity</h4>
<p>“How can you Americans stand all this uniformity?“ Every one of</p>
<p>he dozens of visitors from all over Europe who, during these past
few</p>
<p>years, have discussed their American impressions with me, has
asked</p>
<p>his question in one form or another. Yet what makes every single</p>
<p>one-businessman, clergyman, or scientist; teacher, lawyer, or
jour-</p>
<p>nalist; labor leader or civil servant–come to me for information
is</p>
<p>bewilderment, if not shock, at the incomprehensible and boundless</p>
<p>diversity of this country.</p>
<p>“But somebody must lay out the standard curriculum for the
liberal</p>
<p>arts college. If the federal or the state governments do not do it,
who</p>
<p>does?“</p>
<p>“In what grade does the American high-school student start Latin?</p>
<p>How many hours a week are given to it? And what works of Shake-</p>
<p>speare are normally read in the American high schools?“</p>
<p>“It can’t really be true that there is no one labor union policy
on</p>
<p>industrial engineering. I am told that some unions actually insist on
a</p>
<p>ime and motion study of each job, some unions acquiesce in it,
and</p>
<p>others refuse to allow any industrial engineers. But surely no
union</p>
<p>movement could possibly operate pulling in opposite directions on
a</p>
<p>matter as important as this?“</p>
<p>“Please explain to us what American managements mean when they</p>
<p>alk of ‘decentralization.’ Wouldn’t this mean that different units of
a</p>
<p>First published in Harper’s Magazine, 1952</p>
<p>company would do things differently, adopt different policies,
follow</p>
<p>different ideas? And how could any management allow that and
still</p>
<p>keep its authority and control?“</p>
<p>The going gets really tough when the talk returns to political
institu-</p>
<p>ions or to the churches. That it makes all the difference in the
world</p>
<p>what congressional committee a pending bill is assigned to, will
upset</p>
<p>even the urbane visitor-if indeed he believes it. And among the
most</p>
<p>frustrating hours of my life was the evening I spend with a
Belgian</p>
<p>Jesuit who insisted that there must be one simple principle that
decides</p>
<p>when and where agencies of the Catholic Church in this country
work</p>
<p>ogether with other faiths, and when not. The only comfort was that
he</p>
<p>obviously had got no more satisfaction from his American brethren
in</p>
<p>he order than from me.</p>
<p>Yet it is quite clearly not in diversity that the visitors see the
essence</p>
<p>of America. They are baffled by it, shocked by it, sometimes
fright-</p>
<p>ened by it. But they don’t really believe in it. Their real
convictions</p>
<p>about this country come out in the inevitable question: “But don’t
you</p>
<p>find it trying to live in so uniform a country?“</p>
<p>It is not only the casual visitor, spending a few weeks here, who</p>
<p>believes in “American uniformity“ despite all he sees and hears.
The</p>
<p>belief survives extended exposure to the realities of American
life.</p>
<p>A few months ago a well-known English anthropologist, reviewing</p>
<p>an exhibition of American paintings for a most respectable London</p>
<p>Sunday paper, explained the “mediocrity of American painting“ by
a</p>
<p>reference to “the uniformity of the American landscape-all
prairie</p>
<p>and desert.“ One might remind the reviewer that nothing is more</p>
<p>startling to the immigrant who comes to America to live than the</p>
<p>remendous variety of the landscape and the violence of contrasts in
the</p>
<p>American climate, soils, geology, fauna, and flora. Or one might</p>
<p>reduce the argument to its full absurdity by asking which of these
sons</p>
<p>of Kansas, for example, is the typically uniform prairie product-</p>
<p>William Allen White, Earl Browder, or General Eisenhower? But the</p>
<p>essential fact is not that the argument is nonsense. It is that
Geoffrey</p>
<p>Gorer, the anthropologist, knows this country well, and that the
news-</p>
<p>paper that printed his nonsense is unusually knowledgeable about</p>
<p>hings American on the whole. Yet though they know all about New</p>
<p>England or Virginia or Minnesota or Oregon, though they probably</p>
<p>also know about the artists who paint in the desert of Cape Cod–or
is</p>
<p>The Myth of American Uniformity 61</p>
<p>it a prairie?-they immediately think of “uniformity“ when some-</p>
<p>hing American needs explanation.</p>
<p>Or take the case of the young Danish lawyer who came to see me
just</p>
<p>before sailing back home. He was going to stay just a few minutes
as</p>
<p>he had only one question to ask. In the end he stayed almost the
whole</p>
<p>day-yet left with it still unanswered. His question? In one plant of
the</p>
<p>American company where he worked for seven months as a trainee,
he</p>
<p>found that output standards for the workers were set by a joint
manage-</p>
<p>ment-union committee. In another plant of the same company,
located</p>
<p>just a few miles away and organized by the same local of the same</p>
<p>union, output standards, he found, were considered strictly a
“man-</p>
<p>agement prerogative,“ with union action confined to formal
protests</p>
<p>against management decisions. He was sure he must have been mis-</p>
<p>aken in his observation; at the least, management and union must
both</p>
<p>be eager to have a uniform policy, whereas both seemed perfectly</p>
<p>happy with the existing “disorder.“ It could not convince him that
this</p>
<p>was a fairly common situation all over the country. He left, certain
that</p>
<p>our labor relations must be uniform, if not for the whole country
then</p>
<p>at least for an industry, let alone for one company or one union.</p>
<p>And the “productivity teams“ that have come over from Europe to</p>
<p>study American methods these past few years insist in their reports
that</p>
<p>one of the basic reasons for the greater productivity of American</p>
<p>industry is the “standardization“ of the individual manufacturer on
a</p>
<p>very small number of models or lines. Yet most of the
productivity</p>
<p>reports themselves contain figures which show the exact opposite to
be</p>
<p>rue: the typical American automobile manufacturer (even the
smaller</p>
<p>one), the typical shoe manufacturer, or the typical foundry turns
out</p>
<p>more models than its European counterpart. The people who write</p>
<p>hese reports seem quite unconscious of the contradiction.</p>
<p>Clearly, “American uniformity“ is an axiom for the European,</p>
<p>before and beyond any experience. It is indeed the one thing the</p>
<p>European knows he knows about this country. There are today
plenty</p>
<p>of people in Europe who know that not all Americans are million-</p>
<p>aires-though there are still far too few who know from firsthand</p>
<p>experience how high the standard of living of the American worker</p>
<p>really is. There are even some Europeans who have come to suspect</p>
<p>hat race relations in this country are quite a bit more complex than
in</p>
<p>he books of Richard Wright. But it is a very rare European
indeed-if</p>
<p>he exists at all-who does not know that America is “uniform.“</p>
<p>How is this dogma to be explained? The standard answer is that</p>
<p>here is an outward sameness, a uniformity to all things material in
this</p>
<p>country. I have been skeptical of this answer ever since, a few
years</p>
<p>back, a magnificently accoutered cowboy, complete from white ten-</p>
<p>gallon hat to woolly chaps and silver spurs, complained to me
bitterly</p>
<p>about the “uniformity“ of the American costume, and contrasted it</p>
<p>with the picturesque leather pants, white knee stockings, and
green</p>
<p>suspenders of the Austrian students among whom he had spent a few</p>
<p>months before the war. The “cowboy“ was an earnest young social</p>
<p>worker riding the range in the great cow center of Chicago. And
he</p>
<p>delivered himself of his plaint on the way from a lecture on
psychology</p>
<p>o one on urban community problems during a YMCA conference. His</p>
<p>excuse for his dress-had he felt the need for any-would have been</p>
<p>hat he went folk and square dancing both in the morning, before
the</p>
<p>day’s lectures, and in the evening. But the Austrian students-I did
not</p>
<p>have the heart to tell him-wear their leather pants because they</p>
<p>possess at best one good suit and have to go easy on it.</p>
<p>Altogether there is as little diversity in Europe’s outward
material</p>
<p>appearance as there is in this country. People all through Europe,
right</p>
<p>hrough the Iron Curtain, dress pretty much alike. And when they</p>
<p>don’t-surely even the quaintest Sunday costume of a Slovak maiden</p>
<p>can hardly rival the colors of a Californian going out on the
golf</p>
<p>course, or the ties a Midwestern salesman wears on his rounds.</p>
<p>Our towns and cities, ugly maybe, are not as much uniform as they</p>
<p>are nineteenth- and twentieth-century towns and cities. Even in
Europe</p>
<p>it is primarily the old cities which look different. At least I
know</p>
<p>nothing in this country to rival the bleak monotony of sooty brick
and</p>
<p>broken chimney pots of the railroad ride into London, or the
pea-in-</p>
<p>he-pod uniformity of the famous Dutch housing developments with</p>
<p>heir endless rows of identically neat bungalows. And even the
sun-</p>
<p>drenched limbo-frowzy palms and peeling s t u c c ~ the f middle-</p>
<p>class sections of Los Angeles offers occasional variety and
architec-</p>
<p>ural surprise compared to the numbing grayness through which one</p>
<p>The Myth of American Uniformity 63</p>
<p>drives from the airport into the city that to most Americans stands
as</p>
<p>he symbol of European diversity: Paris.</p>
<p>When it comes to manufactured goods there is actually more diver-</p>
<p>sity in this country than Europe has ever known. The variety of
goods</p>
<p>carried by our stores is the first thing that impresses any visitor
from</p>
<p>abroad. Nor is this a postwar phenomenon. As far back as 1938 one
of</p>
<p>he leading department store chains in England studied the Sears</p>
<p>Roebuck catalogue and concluded that in every single category of</p>
<p>goods the American mail-order business, for all its
“standardization,“</p>
<p>offered a wider range of goods in far more models than any
European</p>
<p>retailer could obtain from European manufacturers, let alone afford
to</p>
<p>carry.</p>
<p>But, you may say, when the European talks about “American unifor-</p>
<p>mity“ he is not thinking of the material and outward aspects of</p>
<p>American life, but of American culture and society. And here the</p>
<p>dogma of American uniformity becomes totally incomprehensible.
For</p>
<p>it is in the nonmaterial realms-in religion, political institutions,
edu-</p>
<p>cation, business life, even in entertainment-that the diversity of
this</p>
<p>country most deeply confuses the visitor from the other side.</p>
<p>Well-informed Europeans have heard that this country’s political</p>
<p>life is founded on pluralism and that our religious organization
knows</p>
<p>no rules-though they seldom seem to realize that these facts
alone</p>
<p>deny the legend of American uniformity. Most of them, however,</p>
<p>believe that this country has uniformity in education. A
hand-picked</p>
<p>eam of British educators, scientists, and industrialists who
recently</p>
<p>studied the relationship between industry and the universities in
this</p>
<p>country, obviously took uniformity for granted-though every
single</p>
<p>fact in their own report contradicted the assumption. Actually
the</p>
<p>diversity in politics and religion here is as nothing compared to the
riot</p>
<p>hat prevails in education-the matrix of society.</p>
<p>There are colleges which look with distrust upon any book written</p>
<p>later than 1300, are pained if they have to teach anything that is at
all</p>
<p>ainted with “usefulness,“ and occasionally even dream of going
back</p>
<p>o teaching in Latin. There are other colleges-giving the same
B.A.</p>
<p>and enjoying the same acceptance by the general public-in which a</p>
<p>student can earn a degree through courses in night-club
etiquette,</p>
<p>horseback riding, and fashion drawing. And in at least one South-</p>
<p>western university you can now get a Ph.D. in square and folk</p>
<p>dancing; last summer I was shown with great pride the first
accepted</p>
<p>doctor’s thesis, a formidable tome of 652 pages, mostly footnotes,
on</p>
<p>“the Left-Turn Hopsa Step in Lithuanian Polkas.“ Greater still is
the</p>
<p>diversity among different kinds and types of colleges, and among</p>
<p>private schools, church schools, and state schools, let alone
such</p>
<p>phenomena, totally incomprehensible to any visitor from abroad,
as</p>
<p>he half-private, half-state university, or the church-supported
but</p>
<p>nonsectarian college. Some of the larger “liberal arts“ colleges
have</p>
<p>flourishing engineering schools of their own, and one large
engineer-</p>
<p>ing school, Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh, also runs a first-rate art
and</p>
<p>music school. And how can one explain to a European, accustomed
to</p>
<p>a Ministry of Education, the role of the private foundations, such
as</p>
<p>Rockefeller or Carnegie, and their power?</p>
<p>It is scarcely possible to talk about trends in American higher</p>
<p>education, so mixed are the currents. Many engineering schools
for</p>
<p>instance have lately broadened their curricula to include more
and</p>
<p>more of the arts and humanities; but Columbia University-itself</p>
<p>preponderantly dedicated to the liberal arts-has just announced
plans</p>
<p>for the most highly specialized Engineering Center. The University
of</p>
<p>Chicago has for some years now been admitting freshmen after only</p>
<p>wo years of high school, with the avowed aim of making the under-</p>
<p>graduate college an intermediate rather than a “higher“
institution;</p>
<p>whereas other well-known schools, in order to make “higher educa-</p>
<p>ion“ really “high,“ increasingly prefer men in their early
twenties</p>
<p>who have spent a few years at work after leaving high school.</p>
<p>Nor is the situation any more uniform in secondary schools.
Within</p>
<p>hirty miles of New York City there are public schools so
progressive</p>
<p>as to live up to the caricatures in the funny papers of the twenties,
and</p>
<p>others so conservative as to justify every word of the
progressives’</p>
<p>indictment of the traditional schools. I have taught college
freshmen</p>
<p>from public schools who had learned more mathematics than most</p>
<p>college curricula offer, and others who had come from schools with
an</p>
<p>equal reputation where mathematics, beyond long division, was an</p>
<p>“elective“ and was taken only by children planning a career in
science</p>
<p>or medicine. There was one proper Bostonian who could remember</p>
<p>only one American president, Benjamin Franklin; the main
educational</p>
<p>dish served at his very proper-Bostonian school had been a rich
stew</p>
<p>The Myth of American Uniformity 65</p>
<p>called “civics“ which contained odd pieces of almost anything
except</p>
<p>he history of his own country. And I have taught other freshmen</p>
<p>whom school had given a sound knowledge of historical facts and
even</p>
<p>he thrill of history. Yet every one of these high schools is
unmistaka-</p>
<p>bly and characteristically “American. “</p>
<p>Even less compatible with the myth of American uniformity is the</p>
<p>reality of American literature-and if education is the matrix of
soci-</p>
<p>ety, literature is its truest reflection. How “uniform“ for instance
are</p>
<p>he American writers who emerged in the literary explosion of the</p>
<p>nineteen-twenties: Sinclair Lewis, Hemingway, Willa Cather, John</p>
<p>Dos Passos, Wolfe, Faulkner, T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Carl
Sand-</p>
<p>burg? A more diverse lot, in style, mood, and subject matter,
could</p>
<p>hardly be imagined; and the diversity becomes the greater the
more</p>
<p>names are added: Sherwood Anderson, for instance, or Ellen
Glasgow,</p>
<p>Dashiell Hammett or H. L. Mencken, Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound,</p>
<p>Eugene O’Neill, or e.e. cummings. And just how “uniform“ are the</p>
<p>hree magazine successes of the same decade, the Reader’s Digest,</p>
<p>Time, and the New Yorker? The educated European knows American</p>
<p>literature and avidly reads our magazines; a good many American</p>
<p>writers may indeed be better known in Europe than here. Yet if there
is</p>
<p>one thing he is sure of it is the “standardization“ of the
American</p>
<p>mind.</p>
<p>Writers and journalists, it may be said, are noncomformists to
begin</p>
<p>with. Well, what about entertainment in America? Our radio stands</p>
<p>perhaps first among the targets of the European critics of
“American</p>
<p>uniformity.“ If everything they are saying about it were true, it
still</p>
<p>would not account for the twenty-five to thirty-five stations–one
in</p>
<p>almost every major city-which offer “serious“ music eight to
twelve</p>
<p>hours a day. None of the “serious“ or “high-brow“ programs of</p>
<p>European radio systems draws enough of an audience to exist
without</p>
<p>heavy subsidies. But a great many of the two or three dozen
“serious“</p>
<p>radio stations in this country manage to operate at a profit, though
they are</p>
<p>supported only by advertisers who are unlikely to be interested
in</p>
<p>anything but a listening audience large enough to justify the
investment.</p>
<p>One station, WABF in New York, is even running an entire Sunday</p>
<p>of music without any advertising, financed solely by voluntary
contri-</p>
<p>butions from its listening audience.</p>
<p>And how is one to explain that young people weaned on “Good</p>
<p>Night, Irene,“ the “Hit Parade,“ and the “Lone Ranger“ rush head-</p>
<p>long into chamber music, as listeners and, increasingly, as players,
as</p>
<p>soon as they reach college? Walking across the campus on a fine
spring</p>
<p>evening one hears “long-haired“ music, from Buxtehude to Bartok,</p>
<p>streaming out of every other open window. Symphony orchestras are</p>
<p>appearing in small towns as well as in large cities. And instead
of</p>
<p>being subsidized, these American orchestras are supported as they
are</p>
<p>formed, by voluntary community action; the Wall Street Journal
re-</p>
<p>ports that more money is spent on symphonies than on basketball.</p>
<p>But what should completely destroy the European’s concept of
Ameri-</p>
<p>can uniformity is the diversity existing in industry. The fact that
in this</p>
<p>country business and industry are part of the country’s culture is to
the</p>
<p>European the most remarkable thing about the United States-to the</p>
<p>point where he greatly overstates the extent to which America has</p>
<p>become a “business society.“ The European businessmen and labor</p>
<p>leaders who have been touring this country under the auspices of
The</p>
<p>Marshall Plan these last four years all report as their central
finding the</p>
<p>experiments in new techniques, new products or processes, in
account-</p>
<p>ing or in labor relations, in organization structure or in
foreman</p>
<p>raining, camed on in almost every company they visit. No two,
they</p>
<p>find, do the same things. In the words of one of these teams,
“Every</p>
<p>American company feels that it has to do something different to stay
in</p>
<p>he race.“ Many teams feel that American competition is too “ex-</p>
<p>reme“; and when pressed to explain why they use this term, they
talk</p>
<p>about the demands on managerial imagination and worker
adaptability</p>
<p>made by the need always to do something different and something</p>
<p>new. The same sort of variety is found in our labor relations. In
Europe</p>
<p>relations between management and union tend to be rigidly and
uni-</p>
<p>formly molded by a central association of industries negotiating with
a</p>
<p>central federation of trade unions; the individual employer or
the</p>
<p>individual union local pays dues but is otherwise inert. Not so
here.</p>
<p>Some of the members of these teams even feel that we carry</p>
<p>diversity too far to be efficient. “I have seen a dozen plans for</p>
<p>management development in as many companies,“ one of the senior</p>
<p>men in British industry told me. “Every one-Standard Oil, Ford,</p>
<p>Johnson andandandand Johnson, Du Pont, General Electric, the
Telephone Com-</p>
<p>pany-has a plan of its own, a staff of its own, a philosophy of
its</p>
<p>The Myth of American Uniformity 67</p>
<p>own. That just makes no sense. Why don’t you fellows get
together,</p>
<p>appoint a committee, and have them work out the one best plan
which</p>
<p>everybody could use and which could be run centrally by a few
top-</p>
<p>flight people?“</p>
<p>It is not even true that within the American plant there is more</p>
<p>“standardization“ than elsewhere, as we have all come to believe.
The</p>
<p>figures tell a different story. In this country of mass production a
larger</p>
<p>proportion of the workers in manufacturing industries are what
the</p>
<p>census calls “skilled workers and foremen“ than in any other
country</p>
<p>on which we have data. And we have an even greater number of men,</p>
<p>proportionately, in executive, technical, and managerial positions.
In</p>
<p>other words American productive strength lies in higher capital
invest-</p>
<p>ment per worker and better management; better planning, better
lay-</p>
<p>out, better scheduling, better personnel relations, better
marketing-</p>
<p>all of which mean more skilled and more trained people rather
than</p>
<p>more unskilled repetitive work.</p>
<p>I am not discussing here the quality of American culture, whether
it</p>
<p>be crude, shallow, vulgar, commercialized, materialist, or, as
the</p>
<p>Marxists maintain, full of “bourgeois idealism.“ My concern here
is</p>
<p>solely with the prevailing European conviction of American
unifor-</p>
<p>mity. And that conviction is an obvious absurdity. Nor could it
be</p>
<p>anything else considering the pragmatic bent of the American
people</p>
<p>and their deeply engrained habit of voluntary and local community</p>
<p>action and community organization.</p>
<p>Indeed any serious student of America has to raise the question</p>
<p>whether there is not too much diversity in this country. There is
the</p>
<p>danger that diversity will degenerate into aimless
multiplicity-differ-</p>
<p>ence for difference’s sake. Jefferson, de Toqueville, and Henry
Ad-</p>
<p>ams, as well as recent critics of American education such as
Robert</p>
<p>Hutchins, have seen in this the major danger facing American
society</p>
<p>and culture.</p>
<p>There is actually more uniformity in European countries, both
mate-</p>
<p>rially and culturally, than in the United States. It may no longer be
true</p>
<p>hat the French minister of education knows at every hour exactly
what</p>
<p>line of what page of what book is being read in every French
school.</p>
<p>But still, in education, in religious life, in political life, in
business as</p>
<p>well as in its cultural ideals, European countries tend to have at
most a</p>
<p>few “types,“ a few molds in which everything is formed. What then</p>
<p>can the European possibly mean when he talks of the “uniformity
of</p>
<p>America’ ’?</p>
<p>He himself, as a visitor, unconsciously furnishes the answer in
the</p>
<p>way he sorts out his American experiences, in the questions he asks,
in</p>
<p>he answers he understands and those he doesn’t. When he thinks of</p>
<p>“diversity“ he tends to think of the contrast between the ways in</p>
<p>which social and economic classes live. He is used to seeing a
definite</p>
<p>and clear-cut upper-class civilization and culture dominating. And
that</p>
<p>indeed he does not find in this country. Therefore the
bewildering</p>
<p>differences in American life appear to him meaningless-mere odd-</p>
<p>ities.</p>
<p>I still remember how the sage of our neighborhood in suburban</p>
<p>Vienna, the wife of the market gardener across the street, explained
the</p>
<p>“Great War,“ the war of 1914-18, when I was a small boy of ten or</p>
<p>eleven: “The war had to come because you couldn’t tell maids from</p>
<p>heir ladies by their dress any more.“ Frau Kiner’s explanation of</p>
<p>history differed from that offered during the nineteen-twenties
by</p>
<p>Europe’s learned sociologists, whether of the Right or of the
Marxist</p>
<p>persuasion, mainly by being brief and simple. They all assumed
that</p>
<p>here must be a distinct upper-class way of life, an upper-class
archi-</p>
<p>ecture, upper-class dress, upper-class goods in an upper-class
mar-</p>
<p>ket-and contrasted with it the “folk culture“ of the peasantry or
the</p>
<p>equally distinct ways of life of the middle class and working
class.</p>
<p>Indeed that eminently sane, that notoriously Americophile
magazine,</p>
<p>he London Economist, echoed Frau Kiner only a few months ago</p>
<p>when it reported with apparent amazement that “to the best of
their</p>
<p>ability-and their ability is great-the [American] manufacturers
make</p>
<p>clothes for the lower-income groups that look just as smart as
those</p>
<p>hey make for the more fortunateM-and explained this perverse at-</p>
<p>empt to make maids look like their ladies as the result of the
“egalitar-</p>
<p>ian obsession“ of this country.</p>
<p>The class-given differentiation in Europe is even more pronounced</p>
<p>in the nonmaterial, the cultural spheres. One example is the
tremen-</p>
<p>dous importance of the “right speech“ in practically every
European</p>
<p>country; for the “right speech“ is upper-class speech. Another
exam-</p>
<p>ple is the extent to which European educational systems are based
on</p>
<p>he education of a ruling class. The Renaissance Courtier, the
Edu-</p>
<p>The Myth of American Uniformity 69</p>
<p>cated Man of the Humanists, the Christian Gentleman of
nineteenth-</p>
<p>century England-the ideal types which embodied the three basic</p>
<p>educational concepts of modem Europe-were all in origin and
intent</p>
<p>ruling-class types. The rising middle class not only did not
overthrow</p>
<p>he class concept of education, it emphasized it as a symbol of its
own</p>
<p>emergence into the ruling group. Similarly, in Occupied Germany
the</p>
<p>working-class leaders-to the chagrin as well as the complete be-</p>
<p>wilderment of American educational advisers-have shown no en-</p>
<p>husiasm for the plan to convert the traditional Gymnasium into an</p>
<p>American high school. To deprive these schools of their
ruling-class</p>
<p>character would actually deprive them of social meaning for
working-</p>
<p>class children.</p>
<p>Europe has even succeeded in turning diversities and differences</p>
<p>hat were not social in their origin into class distinctions. One of
the</p>
<p>best examples of this is the way in which the “gentry“ and its
retainers</p>
<p>became identified with the Church of England while the
“tradesman“</p>
<p>went to “Chapel“-a distinction that held till very recent times and
is</p>
<p>not quite gone yet.</p>
<p>Thus the European myth of American uniformity tells us less about</p>
<p>America than about Europe. For it is based, in the last analysis,
on</p>
<p>Frau Kiner’s belief that a class structure of society is the only
genuine</p>
<p>moral order.</p>
<p>That today the theme of “American uniformity“ is played on above</p>
<p>all by communist propaganda is thus no accident. For the “prole-</p>
<p>ariat“ of communist ideology is indeed a “master class.“ It is a</p>
<p>reaffirmation of the European ruling-class concept and of its
ruling-</p>
<p>class way of life in an extreme form-only turned upside down. On</p>
<p>his rests to a considerable extent the attraction of communism
for</p>
<p>European intellectuals. There is an old Slav peasant proverb:
“There</p>
<p>will always be barons for there must always be peasants.“ All
Vishin-</p>
<p>sky would have to do to change it into an orthodox Soviet proverb</p>
<p>would be to change “barons“ to “proletarian commissars.“ And Frau</p>
<p>Kiner’s philosophy of history he would not have to change at all.</p>
<p>But Frau Kiner’s statement could never have been made in this</p>
<p>country, not even by a sociology professor in a three-volume
tome.</p>
<p>Whether the United States really has no ruling class-and therefore
no</p>
<p>classes at a l l - o r whether, as the Marxists assert, the classes
are only</p>
<p>camouflaged in this country, one thing is certain: this country
knows</p>
<p>no distinct upper-class or lower-class “way of life.“ It knows
only</p>
<p>different ways of making a living.</p>
<p>Indeed there has been only one genuine ruling-class way of life
in</p>
<p>his country since its beginning: that of the plantation aristocracy
in</p>
<p>he Old South between 1760 and 1860. When the nouveaux riches</p>
<p>in the period between the Civil War and the First World War made
the</p>
<p>attempt to set themselves up as “Society“ they failed miserably.
They</p>
<p>could not even develop an upper-class American architecture-and
of</p>
<p>all the arts architecture is the mirror of the way of life. The
tycoons had</p>
<p>o be contented with imitation French chAteaux, Italian
Renaissance</p>
<p>palaces, and Tudor manors-the white elephants which their
servant-</p>
<p>less grandchildren are now frantically turning over to
monasteries,</p>
<p>hospitals, or schools. (It is not entirely an accident, perhaps, that
the</p>
<p>people most eager to live today in the baronial halls of
yesterday’s</p>
<p>capitalists seem to be Soviet delegates.) To find an upper-class way
of</p>
<p>life the tycoons had to gate-crash the Scottish grouse moors, the
Cowes</p>
<p>Regatta, or the Kaiser’s maneuvers in Kiel. In this country it
was</p>
<p>difficult indeed to lead a ruling-class life.</p>
<p>The closest we come today in this country to anything that might
be</p>
<p>called an “upperclass way of life“ is to be found in the top
hierarchy</p>
<p>of the big business corporations. The way people in some of these</p>
<p>companies talk about the “twelfth floor“ or the “front office“
faintly</p>
<p>echoes Frau Kiner’s concept of the “ladies. “ At work the big
business</p>
<p>executive has indeed some of the trappings of a distinct style of
living</p>
<p>in the ceremonial of receptionist, secretary, and big office, in
his</p>
<p>expense account, in the autographed picture of the “big boss“ on
the</p>
<p>wall, the unlisted telephone, and so forth. But only at work. As soon
as</p>
<p>he leaves the office the “big shot“ becomes simply another
business-</p>
<p>man, anonymous and indistinguishable from millions of others. And</p>
<p>he is quite likely to live, like the president of our largest
corporation, in</p>
<p>an eight-room house in a pleasant and comfortable but not
particularly</p>
<p>swank suburb.</p>
<p>In fact, it does not even make too much sense to talk of this
country</p>
<p>as a “middle-class“ society. A middle class has to have a class
on</p>
<p>either side to be in the middle. There is more than a grain of truth
in the</p>
<p>remark made jokingly by one of my European visitors, an Italian</p>
<p>The Myth of American Uniformity 71</p>
<p>student of American literature: “If there were such a thing as a</p>
<p>working-class literature, Babbitt and Arrowsmith would be its models.
“</p>
<p>Any European who has perchance read thus far, will growl that if</p>
<p>Europe’s mental picture of “American uniformity“ is absurd,
Ameri-</p>
<p>ca’s mental picture of “European class society“ is absurder. And he
is</p>
<p>right. In fact, the one myth is the reverse of the other. To the</p>
<p>American, for instance, “class society“ means a society without</p>
<p>social mobility. But Frau Kiner was anything but respectable
lower-</p>
<p>middle class knowing its place. She was a successful social
climber</p>
<p>who had fought her way up from a sharecropper’s shanty and a job
as</p>
<p>scullery maid at fourteen-and had pushed her man up with herself.</p>
<p>And in those years after the first world war she was capping her
social</p>
<p>riumph by marrying off her beautiful and well-dowered daughters
to</p>
<p>“gentlemen’ ‘-elderly and moth-eaten, but undeniably’’gentlemen.
“</p>
<p>Nor is a society in which an Eliza Doolittle can jump from slum
waif</p>
<p>o “great lady“ just by learning upper-class speech a society
without</p>
<p>social mobility. (Indeed there is no better sign of America’s failure
to</p>
<p>understand Europe’s “class society“ than our tendency to play
“Pyg-</p>
<p>malion“ as a farce and as a take-off on upper-class
snobbery-whereas</p>
<p>it is as much crusading pamphlet as comedy of manners, the only</p>
<p>snobs in it being the class-conscious cockneys.) Altogether there
has</p>
<p>been tremendous social mobility in any Western or Central
European</p>
<p>country whenever there was great economic expansion: in Britain</p>
<p>between the Napoleonic Wars and 1860, in Germany a generation</p>
<p>later, in Bohemia-perhaps the most startling example-between 1870</p>
<p>and 1900. The central difference between America and Europe may</p>
<p>well be in the meaning rather than in the extent of social
mobility.</p>
<p>When the boss’s son is made a vice president in this country the</p>
<p>publicity release is likely to stress that his first job was pushing
a</p>
<p>broom. But when a former broom-pusher, born in the Glasgow slums,</p>
<p>gets to be managing director in a British company the official
an-</p>
<p>nouncement is likely to hint gently at descent from Robert Bruce.</p>
<p>I must break off here. Another European visitor has just come in
for</p>
<p>a chat, a young French philosopher, fresh from a six-month tour
of</p>
<p>American universities. I anticipate a pleasant and informative
after-</p>
<p>noon; the letter with which he introduced himself was interesting
and</p>
<p>intelligent. “The thing that impressed me most,“ he wrote, “is that
no</p>
<p>university I visited tries to develop a ‘school of philosophy.’ On
the</p>
<p>contrary each tries to stress different views and different schools
in its</p>
<p>faculty-the exact opposite from what we would normally do.“ Yet I</p>
<p>know that sooner or later in the course of the afternoon he will ask
me,</p>
<p>“Mr. Drucker, don’t you find it very trying to live in so
mechanically</p>
<p>uniform a country?“</p>
