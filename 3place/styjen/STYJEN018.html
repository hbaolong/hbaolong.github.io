<h4 id="social-innovation-managements-new-dimension">Social Innovation:
Management’s New Dimension</h4>
<p>Are we overemphasizing science and technology as this century’s</p>
<p>change agents? Social innovations-few of them owing anything to</p>
<p>science or technology-may have had even profounder impacts on</p>
<p>society and economy, and indeed profound impacts even on science</p>
<p>and technology themselves. And management is increasingly becom-</p>
<p>ing the agent of social innovation.</p>
<p>Here are five examples-five among many:</p>
<p>he research lab;</p>
<p>Eurodollar and commercial paper;</p>
<p>mass and mass movement;</p>
<p>he farm agent; and</p>
<p>management itself as an organized function and discipline.</p>
<p>The Research Lab</p>
<p>The research lab as we now know it dates back to 1905. It was</p>
<p>conceived and built for the General Electric Company in
Schenectady,</p>
<p>New York, by one of the earliest “research managers,“ the German-</p>
<p>American physicist Charles Proteus Steinmetz. Steinmetz had two</p>
<p>clear objectives from the start: to organize science and scientific
work</p>
<p>Written for and first published in my essay volume The Frontier of
Management,</p>
<ol start="1986" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>for purposeful technological invention and to build continuous
self-</p>
<p>renewal through innovation into that new social phenomenon-the
big</p>
<p>corporation.</p>
<p>Steinmetz took two of the features of his new lab from
nineteenth-</p>
<p>century predecessors. From the German engineer, Hefner-Alteneck,</p>
<p>he took the idea of setting up within a company a separate group of
sci-</p>
<p>entifically and technically trained people to devote themselves
exclu-</p>
<p>sively to scientific and technical work-something Hefner-Alteneck</p>
<p>had pioneered in 1872 in the Siemens Company in Berlin five years</p>
<p>after he had joined it as the first college-trained engineer to be
hired</p>
<p>anywhere by an industrial company. From Thomas Alva Edison,</p>
<p>Steinmetz took the research project: the systematic organization
of</p>
<p>research, beginning with a clear definition of the expected end
result</p>
<p>and identification of the steps in the process and of their
sequence.</p>
<p>But Steinmetz then added three features of his own. First, his</p>
<p>researchers were to work in teams. Hefner-Alteneck’s “designers“-</p>
<p>he term researcher came much later-had worked the way scientists</p>
<p>worked in the nineteenth-century university, each in his own lab with
a</p>
<p>helper or two who ran errands for the “boss,“ looked up things
for</p>
<p>him, or, at most, carried out experiments the boss had specified.
In</p>
<p>Steinmetz’s lab there were seniors and juniors rather than bosses
and</p>
<p>helpers. They worked as colleagues, each making his own
contribution</p>
<p>o a common effort. Steinmetz’s teams thus required a research
direc-</p>
<p>or to assign researchers to projects and projects to researchers.</p>
<p>Second, Steinmetz brought together on the same team people of</p>
<p>diverse skills and disciplines-engineers, physicists,
mathematicians,</p>
<p>chemists, even biologists. This was brand-new and heretical.
Indeed,</p>
<p>it violated the most sacred principle of nineteenth-century
scientific</p>
<p>organization: the principle of maximum specialization. But the
first</p>
<p>Nobel Prize awarded to a scientist in industrial research was
awarded</p>
<p>in 1932 to a chemist, Irvin Langmuir, who worked in Steinmetz’s</p>
<p>electrotechnical lab.</p>
<p>Finally, Steinmetz’s lab radically redefined the relationship
between</p>
<p>science and technology in research. In setting the goals of his
project,</p>
<p>Steinmetz identified the new theoretical science needed to
accomplish</p>
<p>he desired technological results and then organized the
appropriate</p>
<p>L6</p>
<p>pure“ research to obtain the needed new knowledge. Steinmetz</p>
<p>Social Innovation: Management’s New Dimension 179</p>
<p>himself was originally a theoretical physicist; on a recent U.S.
postage</p>
<p>stamp he is being honored for his “contributions to electrical
theory.“</p>
<p>But every one of his “contributions“ was the result of research he
had</p>
<p>planned and specified as part of a project to design and to develop
a</p>
<p>new product line, for example, fractional horsepower motors.
Tech-</p>
<p>nology, traditional wisdom held and still widely holds, is
“applied</p>
<p>science.“ In Steinmetz’s lab science-including the purest of
“pure</p>
<p>research3’-is technology-driven, that is, a means to a
technological</p>
<p>end.</p>
<p>Ten years after Steinmetz completed the General Electric lab, the</p>
<p>famed Bell Labs were established on the same pattern. A little later
Du</p>
<p>Pont followed suit, and then IBM. In developing what eventually</p>
<p>became nylon, Du Pont worked out a good deal of the pure science
for</p>
<p>polymer chemistry. In the 1930s when IBM started to develop what</p>
<p>eventually became the computer, it included from the beginning
re-</p>
<p>search in switching theory, solid-state physics, and computer logic
in</p>
<p>its engineering project.</p>
<p>Steinmetz’s innovation also led to the “lab without walls,“ which
is</p>
<p>America’s specific, and major, contribution to very large scientific
and</p>
<p>echnological programs. The first of these, conceived and managed
by</p>
<p>President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s former law partner, Basil
O’Con-</p>
<p>nor, was the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (March
of</p>
<p>Dimes), which tackled polio in the early 1930s. This project
continued</p>
<p>for more than twenty-five years and brought together in a
planned,</p>
<p>step-by-step effort a large number of scientists from half a
dozen</p>
<p>disciplines, in a dozen different locations across the country,
each</p>
<p>working on his own project but within a central strategy and
under</p>
<p>overall direction. This then established the pattern for the great
World</p>
<p>War I1 projects: the RADAR lab, the Lincoln Laboratory and, most</p>
<p>massive of them all, the Manhattan Project for atomic energy.
Sim-</p>
<p>ilarly, NASA organized a “research lab without walls“ when this</p>
<p>country decided, after Sputnik, to put a man on the moon.
Steinmetz’s</p>
<p>echnology-driven science is still highly controversial, is indeed
an-</p>
<p>athema to many academic scientists. Still, it is the organization
we</p>
<p>immediately reach for whenever a new scientific problem emerges,
for</p>
<p>example, when AIDS suddenly became a major medical problem in</p>
<p>1984-85.</p>
<p>Eurodollar and Commercial Paper</p>
<p>In fewer than twenty years, the financial systems of the world
have</p>
<p>changed more perhaps than in the preceding two hundred. The
change</p>
<p>agents were two social innovations: the Eurodollar and the use of</p>
<p>commercial paper as a new form of “commercial loan.“ The first</p>
<p>created a new world economy, dominated by the “symbol“ economy</p>
<p>of capital flows, exchange rates, and credits. The second triggered
the</p>
<p>“financial revolution“ in the United States. It has replaced the
old,</p>
<p>and seemingly perennial, segmentation of financial institutions
into</p>
<p>insurance companies, savings banks, commercial banks, stock bro-</p>
<p>kers, and so on, by “financial supermarkets,“ each focused on
what-</p>
<p>ever financial services the market needs rather than on specific
finan-</p>
<p>cial products. And this financial revolution is now spreading</p>
<p>worldwide.</p>
<p>Neither the Eurodollar nor commercial paper was designed as “rev-</p>
<p>olutionary.“ The Eurodollar was invented by the Soviet Union’s
State</p>
<p>Bank when General Eisenhower was elected president of the United</p>
<p>States in 1952, in the middle of the Korean War. The Russians
feared</p>
<p>hat the new president would embargo their dollar deposits in
Ameri-</p>
<p>can banks to force them to stop supporting the North Koreans.
They</p>
<p>hus hurriedly withdrew these deposits from American banks. Yet
they</p>
<p>wanted to keep their money in American dollars. The solution they</p>
<p>found was the Eurodollar: a deposit denominated in U.S. currency
but</p>
<p>kept in a bank outside the United States. And this then created,
within</p>
<p>wenty years, a new supranational money and capital market. It is</p>
<p>outside and beyond the control of national central banks, and
indeed</p>
<p>otally unregulated. Yet in its totality-and there are now Euroyen
and</p>
<p>Euro-Swiss-francs and Euromark in addition to Eurodollars-it is</p>
<p>larger in both deposits and turnover than the deposits and turnover
of</p>
<p>he banking and credit systems of all major trading nations taken</p>
<p>ogether. Indeed, without this innovation on the part of the
overseas</p>
<p>executives of the Soviet State Bank–every one undoubtedly a good</p>
<p>Communist-capitalism might not have survived. It made possible
the</p>
<p>enormous expansion of world trade, which has been the engine of</p>
<p>economic growth and prosperity in the developed free enterprise
coun-</p>
<p>ries these last thirty years.</p>
<p>At about the same time, perhaps a little later, two American
finan-</p>
<p>Social Innovation: Management’s New Dimension 181</p>
<p>cia1 institutions-one a brokerage house, Goldman Sachs, the other
a</p>
<p>finance company, General Electric Credit Corporation (founded to</p>
<p>provide credit to the buyers of General Electric’s electrical
machin-</p>
<p>ery)-hit on the idea of using an old but totally obscure
financial</p>
<p>instrument, the “commercial paper,“ as a new form of commercial</p>
<p>loan, that is, as a substitute for bank credit. Neither institution
is</p>
<p>allowed under American financial regulations to make commercial</p>
<p>loans-only banks are. But commercial paper, essentially simply a</p>
<p>promise to pay a certain amount at a certain date, is not considered
a</p>
<p>loan in American law but a security, and this, in turn, banks are
not</p>
<p>permitted to issue. Economically, however, there is not the
slightest</p>
<p>difference between the two-something which nobody had, however,</p>
<p>seen earlier. By exploiting this legal technicality these two firms,
and</p>
<p>dozens of others following them in short order, managed to
outflank</p>
<p>he seemingly impregnable lending monopoly of the commercial</p>
<p>banks, especially as credit based on commercial paper can be
provided</p>
<p>at substantially lower interest rates than banks can lend money
against</p>
<p>customers’ deposits. The banks at first dismissed commercial paper
as</p>
<p>a mere gimmick. But within fifteen years it had abolished most, if
not</p>
<p>all, of the demarcation lines and barriers between all kinds of
credits</p>
<p>and investments in the American economy to the point that, today,</p>
<p>practically every financial institution and every financial
instrument</p>
<p>competes with every other institution and every other financial
instru-</p>
<p>ment.</p>
<p>For almost two hundred years economists have considered the
finan-</p>
<p>cial and credit system to be the central core of an economy, and
its</p>
<p>most important feature. In every country it is hedged in by laws,
rules,</p>
<p>and regulations, all designed to preserve the system and to prevent
any</p>
<p>changes in it. And nowhere was the financial system more highly</p>
<p>structured and more carefully guarded than in the United States.</p>
<p>Commercial paper-little but a change in a term and almost
insignifi-</p>
<p>cant as an innovation-has broken through all safeguards of law,</p>
<p>regulation, and custom and has subverted the American financial</p>
<p>system. We still rank the country’s banks. But although New
York’s</p>
<p>Citibank is surely the country’s largest bank-and altogether the
coun-</p>
<p>ry’s largest “financial institution“-the “number-two bank“ is
prob-</p>
<p>ably not a bank at all, but General Electric Credit Corporation.
And</p>
<p>Walter Wriston, the long-time chairman of Citibank, points out
that</p>
<p>Citibank’s biggest competitor in banking and finance is not a
financial</p>
<p>institution at all but Sears, Roebuck, the country’s largest
department</p>
<p>store chain, which now gives more consumer credit than any credit</p>
<p>institution.</p>
<p>Mass and Mass Movement</p>
<p>A third social innovation of this century are mass and mass move-</p>
<p>ments. The mass is a collective. It has a behavior of its own and
an</p>
<p>identity of its own. It is not irrational; on the contrary, it is
highly</p>
<p>predictable. But its dynamics are what in an individual we would
call</p>
<p>“the subconscious. “</p>
<p>The essence of the mass movement is concentration. Its individual</p>
<p>“molecules,“ the individuals who comprise it, are what a chemist</p>
<p>calls highly organized and highly charged. They all point in the
same</p>
<p>direction, all carry the same charge. In the nuclear physicist’s
terms,</p>
<p>he mass is a critical mass, that is, the smallest fraction big enough
to</p>
<p>alter the nature and behavior of the whole.</p>
<p>The mass was first invented-for it was an invention and not just
a</p>
<p>discovery-in the closing years of the nineteenth century when,
ex-</p>
<p>ploiting the then brand-new literacy, two Americans, Joseph
Pulitzer</p>
<p>and William Randolph Hearst, created the first mass medium, the</p>
<p>cheap, mass-circulation newspaper. Until then a newspaper was
meant</p>
<p>o be “written by gentlemen for gentlemen,“ as the masthead of one
of</p>
<p>he London newspapers proudly proclaimed for many years.
Pulitzer’s</p>
<p>and Hearst’s “yellow press“ by contrast was sneered at as “being</p>
<p>written by pimps for guttersnipes.“ But it created a mass
readership</p>
<p>and a mass following.</p>
<p>These two men and their newspapers then created and led the first</p>
<p>modern political mass movement, the campaign to force the United</p>
<p>States into the Spanish-American War of 1898. The tactics that
these</p>
<p>wo men developed have since become standard for all mass move-</p>
<p>ments. They did not even try to win over the majority as earlier</p>
<p>American movements-the abolitionists or the Free Soilers, for</p>
<p>instance-had done. On the contrary, they tried to organize a
minority</p>
<p>of true believers: they probably never attracted more than 10 percent
of</p>
<p>he electorate. But they organized this following as a disciplined</p>
<p>“shock troop“ around the single cause of fighting Spain. They
urged</p>
<p>Social Innovation: Management’s New Dimension 183</p>
<p>heir readers in every issue to clip out and mail a postcard to
their</p>
<p>congressman demanding that America declare war on Spain. And they</p>
<p>made a candidate’s willingness to commit himself on the war issue
the</p>
<p>sole criterion for endorsing or opposing him regardless of his
position</p>
<p>on any other issue. Thus, their small minority had the “swing
vote“</p>
<p>and could claim control of the political future of the candidates. In
the</p>
<p>end it imposed its will on the great majority, even though almost
every</p>
<p>opinion maker in the country was opposed.</p>
<p>A mass movement is powerful precisely because the majority has a</p>
<p>diversity of interests all over the lot and is thus lukewarm in
regard to</p>
<p>all of them and zealous in respect to none. The single cause gives
the</p>
<p>mass movement its discipline and its willingness to follow a leader.
It</p>
<p>hus makes it stand out and appear much bigger than it really is.
It</p>
<p>enables a single cause to dominate the news and, indeed, largely
to</p>
<p>determine what is news. And because it makes its support of
parties</p>
<p>and candidates totally dependent on their willingness or
unwillingness</p>
<p>o commit themselves to the single cause, it may cast the deciding</p>
<p>vote.</p>
<p>The first to apply what Pulitzer and Hearst had invented to a</p>
<p>permanent “crusade“ was the temperance movement. For almost a</p>
<p>century such temperance groups as the Anti-Saloon League and the</p>
<p>Women’s Christian Temperance Union had struggled and campaigned</p>
<p>without much success. Around 1900 their support was probably at
its</p>
<p>lowest level since the Civil War. And then they adopted the new
tactics</p>
<p>of the mass movement. The Women’s Christian Temperance Union</p>
<p>even hired several of Pulitzer’s and Hearst’s editors. The “true
be-</p>
<p>lievers“ in Prohibition never numbered more than 5 or 10 percent
of</p>
<p>he electorate. But in less than twenty years they had Prohibition</p>
<p>written into the Constitution.</p>
<p>Since then, single causes-the environment, automobile safety,</p>
<p>nuclear disarmament, gay rights, the Moral Majority-have become</p>
<p>commonplace. But we are only now beginning to realize how pro-</p>
<p>foundly the single-cause mass movement has changed the politics
of</p>
<p>all democratic countries.</p>
<p>And outside of the United States the social innovation of the
mass</p>
<p>has had even greater impacts. The great tyrannies of this
century-</p>
<p>Lenin7s and Stalin’s Bolsheviks, Mussolini’s Fascism, Hitler’s
Na-</p>
<p>zism, even Maoism-are all applications of the mass movement, the</p>
<p>highly disciplined single-cause minority of true believers, to the
ulti-</p>
<p>mate political goal of gaining and holding power.</p>
<p>Surely no discovery or invention of this century has had greater</p>
<p>impact than the social innovation of mass and mass movement. Yet</p>
<p>none is less understood.</p>
<p>Indeed, in respect to the mass we are today pretty much where we</p>
<p>were in respect to the psychodynamics of the individual a hundred</p>
<p>years ago. Of course we knew of the “passions.“ But they were</p>
<p>something one could only explain away as part of “animal nature.“</p>
<p>They lay outside the rational, that is, outside prediction, analysis,
and</p>
<p>understanding. All one could do was to suppress them. And then,</p>
<p>beginning a hundred years ago, Freud showed that the passions
have</p>
<p>heir reasons, that indeed, in Pascal’s famous phrase, “the heart has
its</p>
<p>reasons of which Reason knows nothing.“ Freud showed that the</p>
<p>subconscious is as strictly rational as the conscious, that it has
its own</p>
<p>logic and its own mechanisms. And although not all psychologists</p>
<p>oday-indeed, not even the majority-accept the specific causative</p>

psychodynamics</p>
<p>of the individual.</p>
<p>But so far we still lack a Sigmund Freud of the mass.</p>
<p>The Farm Agent</p>
<p>The single, most important economic event of this century is
surely</p>
<p>he almost exponential rise in farm production and farm
productivity</p>
<p>worldwide (except, of course, in the Soviet Union). It was
brought</p>
<p>about primarily through a social innovation of the early years of
this</p>
<p>century: the farm agent.</p>
<p>Karl Marx, a hundred years ago, had good reason for his dismissal</p>
<p>of the “peasant“ as hopelessly ignorant and hopelessly
unproductive.</p>
<p>Indeed, practically every nineteenth-century observer shared
Marx’s</p>
<p>contempt. By 1880, serious, systematic scientific work on
agricultural</p>
<p>methods and agricultural technology had been going on for two
hun-</p>
<p>dred years. Even the systematic training of farmers and agronomists
in</p>
<p>an “agricultural university“ had been started one hundred years
ear-</p>
<p>lier. Yet only a very small number of large landowners were
paying</p>
<p>any attention. The vast majority of farms-practically all
American</p>
<p>Social Innovation: Management’s New Dimension 185</p>
<p>farmers, for i n s t a n c e a i d not, in 1880, farm any
differently, farm any</p>
<p>better, or produce any more than their ancestors had done for
centu-</p>
<p>ries. And twenty years later, around 1900, things still had not
changed.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, around the time of World War I-maybe a little</p>
<p>later-things changed drastically. The change began in the United</p>
<p>States. By now it has spread everywhere; indeed, the surge in
farm</p>
<p>production and farm productivity has become most pronounced in</p>
<p>Third World countries such as India.</p>
<p>What happened was not that farmers suddenly changed their spots.</p>
<p>What happened was a social innovation that put the new
agricultural</p>
<p>knowledge within farmers’ reach. Julius Rosenwald, the chief
execu-</p>
<p>ive of a mail-order company, Sears, Roebuck, himself a Chicago</p>
<p>clothing merchant and the purest of “city slickers,“ invented the
farm</p>
<p>agent (and for ten years paid farm agents out of his own pocket
until</p>
<p>he U.S. government took over the Farm Extension Service). He did</p>
<p>not do this out of philanthropy alone, but primarily to create
purchas-</p>
<p>ing power among his company’s customers, the American farmers.</p>
<p>The farm agent provided what had hitherto been lacking: a conduit</p>
<p>from the steadily increasing pool of agricultural knowledge and
infor-</p>
<p>mation to the practitioners on the farm. And within a few short
years</p>
<p>he “ignorant, reactionary, tradition-steeped peasant“ of Marx’s
time</p>
<p>had become the “farm technologist“ of the “scientific revolution
on</p>
<p>he farm. “</p>
<p>Management</p>
<p>My last example of a social innovation is management. “Manag-</p>
<p>ers,“ of course, have been around a long time. The term itself
is,</p>
<p>however, of twentieth-century coinage. And it is only in this
century,</p>
<p>and largely within the last fifty years, that management has emerged
as</p>
<p>a generic function of society, as a distinct kind of work, and as
a</p>
<p>discipline. A century ago most major tasks, including the
economic</p>
<p>ask we call business, were done mainly in and by the family or by</p>
<p>family-run enterprises such as the artisan’s small workshop. By
now</p>
<p>all of them have become organized in institutions: government
agency</p>
<p>and university, hospital, business enterprise, Red Cross, labor
union,</p>
<p>and so on. And all of them have to be managed. Management is thus</p>
<p>he specific function of today’s “society of organizations.“ It is
the</p>
<p>specific practice that converts a mob into an effective, purposeful,
and</p>
<p>productive group.</p>
<p>Management and organization have become global rather than</p>
<p>Western or capitalist. The Japanese introduced management as an</p>
<p>organized discipline in the early 1950s, and it became the
foundation</p>
<p>for their spectacular economic and social successes. Management is
a</p>
<p>very hot topic in the Soviet Union. And one of the first moves of
the</p>
<p>Chinese after the retreat from Maoism was to set up an Enterprise</p>
<p>Management Agency in the prime minister’s office and import an</p>
<p>American-style management school.</p>
<p>The essence of modem organization is to make individual strengths</p>
<p>and knowledge productive and to make individual weaknesses
irrele-</p>
<p>vant. In traditional organizations-the ones that built the pyramids
and</p>
<p>he Gothic cathedrals, or in the armies of the eighteenth and
nineteenth</p>
<p>centuries–everybody did exactly the same unskilled jobs in which</p>
<p>brute strength was the main contribution. Such knowledge as
existed</p>
<p>was concentrated at the top and in very few heads.</p>
<p>In modem organizations everybody has specialized and fairly ad-</p>
<p>vanced knowledge and skill. In the modern organization there are
the</p>
<p>metallurgist and the Red Cross disaster specialist, the trainer and
the</p>
<p>ool designer, the fund raiser and the physical therapist, the
budget</p>
<p>analyst and the computer programmer, all doing their work, all
con-</p>
<p>ributing their knowledge, but all working toward a joint end. The
little</p>
<p>each knows matters; the infinity each doesn’t know, does not.</p>
<p>The two cultures today may not be those of the humanist and the</p>
<p>scientist as C. P. Snow, the English physicist turned novelist,
pro-</p>
<p>claimed thirty years ago. They may be the cultures of what might
be</p>
<p>called the literati and the managers: The one sees reality as ideas
and</p>
<p>symbols; the other sees reality as performance and people.</p>
<p>Management and organization are still quite primitive. As is com-</p>
<p>mon in a rapidly evolving discipline-as was true, for instance,
in</p>
<p>medicine until fairly recently-the gap between the leading
practi-</p>
<p>ioners and the great majority is enormously wide and is closing
but</p>
<p>slowly. Far too few, even of the most accomplished of today’s
manag-</p>
<p>ers in all organizations, realize that management is defined by
respon-</p>
<p>sibility and not by power. Far too few fight the debilitating disease
of</p>
<p>Social Innovation: Management’s New Dimension 187</p>
<p>bureaucracy: the belief that big budgets and a huge staff are
accom-</p>
<p>plishments rather than incompetence.</p>
<p>Still, the impact has been enormous. Management and its emer-</p>
<p>gence have, for instance, rendered equally obsolete both social
theo-</p>
<p>ries that dominated the nineteenth century and its political
rhetoric: the</p>
<p>Jeffersonian creed that sees society moving toward a crystalline
struc-</p>
<p>ure of independent small owners-the yeoman on his forty acres,
the</p>
<p>artisan in his workshop, the shopkeeper who owns his own store,
the</p>
<p>independent professional-and the Marxist theorem of a society
inex-</p>
<p>orably turning into an amorphous gas of equally impoverished,
equally</p>
<p>disenfranchised proletarians. Instead, organization has created an
em-</p>
<p>ployee society. In the employee society, blue-collar workers are
a</p>
<p>steadily shrinking minority. Kowledge workers are the new and
grow-</p>
<p>ing majority-both the main cost and the main resource of all
devel-</p>
<p>oped societies. And although knowledge workers are employees,
they</p>
<p>are not proletarians but, through their pension funds, the only
capital-</p>
<p>ists and, collectively, the owners of the means of production.</p>
<p>It is management which in large measure accounts for this
century’s</p>
<p>most extraordinary social phenomenon: the educational explosion.
The</p>
<p>more highly schooled people are, the more dependent they then be-</p>
<p>come on organizations. Practically all people with schooling
beyond</p>
<p>high school, in all developed countries-in the United States the
figure</p>
<p>is 90 percent plus-will spend all their working lives as employees
of</p>
<p>managed organizations and could not make their living without
them.</p>
<p>Neither could their teachers.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>If this were a history of social innovation in the twentieth century,
I</p>
<p>would have to cite and to discuss scores of additional examples.
But</p>
<p>his is not the purpose of this essay. The purpose is not even to
show</p>
<p>he importance of social innovation. It is, above all, to show that
social</p>
<p>innovation in the twentieth century has largely become the task of
the</p>
<p>manager.</p>
<p>This was not always the case; on the contrary, it is quite new.</p>
<p>The act that, so to speak, ushered in the nineteenth century was
an</p>
<p>innovation: the American Constitution. Constitutions were, of
course,</p>
<p>nothing new; they go back to ancient Greece. But the American</p>
<p>Constitution was different: It first provided expessly a process for
its</p>
<p>own change. Every earlier constitution had been presumed
unchange-</p>
<p>able and an “eternal verity.“ And then the Americans created in
the</p>
<p>Supreme Court a mechanism to adapt the Constitution to new condi-</p>
<p>ions and demands. These two innovations explain why the American</p>
<p>Constitution has survived where all earlier ones perished after a
short</p>
<p>life of total frustration.</p>
<p>A hundred years later, Prince Bismarck in Germany created, with-</p>
<p>out any precedent, the social innovations we now call Social
Secu-</p>
<p>rity-health insurance, old-age pensions, and workmen’s compensa-</p>
<p>ion insurance against industrial accidents, which were followed a
little</p>
<p>later by unemployment compensation. Bismarck knew exactly what he</p>
<p>was trying to do: defuse a “class war“ that threatened to tear
asunder</p>
<p>he very fabric of society. And he succeeded. Within fifteen
years,</p>
<p>socialism in Western and Northern Europe had ceased to be
“revolu-</p>
<p>ionary“ and had become “revisionist. “</p>
<p>Outside of the West, the nineteenth century produced the tremen-</p>
<p>dous social innovations of the Meiji Restoration in Japan, which</p>
<p>enabled the least Western and most isolated of all contemporary</p>
<p>countries both to become a thoroughly “modem“ state and nation
and</p>
<p>o maintain its social and cultural identity.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century was thus a period of very great social</p>
<p>innovation. But, with only a few exceptions, social innovtions in
the</p>
<p>nineteenth century were made by governments. Invention, that is,</p>
<p>echnical discovery, the nineteenth century left to the private
sector.</p>
<p>Social innovation was governmental and a political act.</p>
<p>Somehow, in this century, government seems to have lost its
ability</p>
<p>o do effective social innovation. It could still do it in America’s
New</p>
<p>Deal in the 1930s, although the only New Deal innovations that</p>
<p>worked were things that had been designed and thoroughly tested</p>
<p>earlier, often before World War I, in the large-scale “pilot
experi-</p>
<p>ments“ conducted by individual states such as Wisconsin, New
York,</p>
<p>and California. Since then, however, we have had very few govern-</p>
<p>mental innovations in any developed country that have produced
the</p>
<p>results for which they were designed-very few indeed that have</p>
<p>produced any results except massive costs.</p>
<p>Instead, social innovation has been taken over by the private,
non-</p>
<p>Social Innovation: Management’s New Dimension 189</p>
<p>governmental sector. From being a political act it has become a</p>
<p>“managerial task.“ We still have little methodology for it, though
we</p>
<p>now do possess a “discipline of innovation.“ Few social innovators
in</p>
<p>management yet know what they intend to accomplish the way the</p>
<p>American Founding Fathers, Bismarck, and the statesmen of Meiji</p>
<p>did-though the examples of Rosenwald’s farm agent would indicate</p>
<p>hat it can be done. Still, social innovation has clearly become
manage-</p>
<p>ment’s new dimension.</p>
