<h4 id="the-first-technological-revolution-and-its-lessons">The First
Technological Revolution and Its Lessons</h4>
<p>Aware that we are living in the midst of a technological
revolution,</p>
<p>we are becoming increasingly concerned with its meaning for the</p>
<p>individual and its impact on freedom, on society, and on our
political</p>
<p>institutions. Side by side with messianic promises of utopia to
be</p>
<p>ushered in by technology, there are the most dire warnings of
man’s</p>
<p>enslavement by technology, his alienation from himself and from</p>
<p>society, and the destruction of all human and political values.</p>
<p>Tremendous though today’s technological explosion is, it is
hardly</p>
<p>greater than the first great revolution technology wrought in human
life</p>
<p>seven thousand years ago when the first great civilization of man,
the</p>
<p>irrigation civilization, established itself. First in Mesopotamia,
and</p>
<p>hen in Egypt and in the Indus Valley, and finally in China, there</p>
<p>appeared a new society and a new polity: the irrigation city, which
then</p>
<p>rapidly became the irrigation empire. No other change in man’s way
of</p>
<p>life and in his making a living, not even the changes under way
today,</p>
<p>so completely revolutionized human society and community. In
fact,</p>
<p>he irrigation civilizations were the beginning of history, if only
be-</p>
<p>cause they brought writing.</p>
<p>The age of the irrigation civilization was preeminently an age of</p>
<p>echnological innovation. Not until a historical yesterday, the
eigh-</p>
<p>eenth century, did technological innovations emerge which were
com-</p>
<p>Presidential address to the Society for the History of Technology,
1965.</p>
<p>parable in their scope and impact to those early changes in
technology,</p>
<p>ools, and processes. Indeed, the technology of man remained
essen-</p>
<p>ially unchanged until the eighteenth century in so far as its impact
on</p>
<p>human life and human society is concerned.</p>
<p>But the irrigation civilizations were not only one of the great ages
of</p>
<p>echnology. They represent also mankind’s greatest and most
produc-</p>
<p>ive age of social and political innovation. The historian of ideas
is</p>
<p>prone to go back to Ancient Greece, to the Old Testament prophets,
or</p>
<p>o the China of the early dynasties for the sources of the beliefs
that</p>
<p>still move men to action. But our fundamental social and
political</p>
<p>institutions antedate political philosophy by several thousand
years.</p>
<p>They all were conceived and established in the early dawn of the</p>
<p>irrigation civilizations. Anyone interested in social and
governmental</p>
<p>institutions and in social and political processes will increasingly
have</p>
<p>o go back to those early irrigation cities. And, thanks to the work
of</p>
<p>archaeologists and linguists during the last fifty years, we
increasingly</p>
<p>have the information, we increasingly know what the irrigation
civili-</p>
<p>zations looked like, we increasingly can go back to them for our</p>
<p>understanding both of antiquity and of modem society. For
essentially</p>
<p>our present-day social and political institutions, practically
without</p>
<p>exception, were then created and established. Here are a few
exam-</p>
<p>ples.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The irrigation city first established government as a distinct
and</li>
</ol>
<p>permanent institution. It established an impersonal government with
a</p>
<p>clear hierarchical structure in which very soon there arose a
genuine</p>
<p>bureaucracy-which is, of course, what enabled the irrigation cities
to</p>
<p>become irrigation empires.</p>
<p>Even more basic: the irrigation city first conceived of man as a</p>
<p>citizen. It had to go beyond the narrow bounds of tribe and clan
and</p>
<p>had to weld people of very different origins and blood into one</p>
<p>community. This required the first supratribal deity, the god of
the</p>
<p>city. It also required the first clear distinction between custom and
law</p>
<p>and the development of an impersonal, abstract, codified legal
system.</p>
<p>Indeed, practically all legal concepts, whether of criminal or of
civil</p>
<p>law, go back to the irrigation city. The first great code of law,
that of</p>
<p>Hammurabi, almost four thousand years ago, would still be
applicable</p>
<p>o a good deal of legal business in today’s highly developed,
industrial</p>
<p>society.</p>
<p>The First Technological Revolution and Its Lessons 307</p>
<p>The irrigation city also first developed a standing army-it had
to.</p>
<p>For the farmer was defenseless and vulnerable and, above all,
immo-</p>
<p>bile. The irrigation city which, thanks to its technology, produced
a</p>
<p>surplus, for the first time in human affairs, was a most attractive
target</p>
<p>for the barbarian outside the gates, the tribal nomads of steppe
and</p>
<p>desert. And with the army came specific fighting technology and</p>
<p>fighting equipment: the war horse and the chariot, the lance and
the</p>
<p>shield, armor and the catapult.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>It was in the irrigation city that social classes first developed.
It</li>
</ol>
<p>needed people permanently engaged in producing the farm products
on</p>
<p>which all the city lived; it needed farmers. It needed soldiers to
defend</p>
<p>hem. And it needed a governing class with knowledge, that is,</p>
<p>originally a priestly class. Down to the end of the nineteenth
century</p>
<p>hese three “estates“ were still considered basic in society.’</p>
<p>But at the same time the irrigation city went in for specialization
of</p>
<p>labor resulting in the emergence of artisans and craftsmen:
potters,</p>
<p>weavers, metalworkers, and so on; and of professional people:
scribes,</p>
<p>lawyers, judges, physicians.</p>
<p>And because it produced a surplus, it first engaged in organized</p>
<p>rade which brought with it not only the merchant but money,
credit,</p>
<p>and a law that extended beyond the city to give protection,
predic-</p>
<p>ability, and justice to the stranger, the trader from far away. This,
by</p>
<p>he way, also made necessary international relations and
international</p>
<p>law. In fact, there is not very much difference between a
nineteenth-</p>
<p>century trade treaty and the trade treaties of the irrigation empires
of</p>
<p>antiquity.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The irrigation city first had knowledge, organized it, and
institu-</li>
</ol>
<p>ionalized it. Both because it required considerable knowledge to</p>
<p>construct and maintain the complex engineering works that
regulated</p>
<p>he vital water supply and because it had to manage complex
economic</p>
<p>ransactions stretching over many years and over hundreds of
miles,</p>
<p>he irrigation city needed records, and this, of course, meant
writing. It</p>
<p>needed astronomical data, as it depended on a calendar. It needed</p>
<p>means of navigating across sea or desert. It, therefore, had to
organize</p>
<p>both the supply of the needed information and its processing into</p>
<p>learnable and teachable knowledge. As a result, the irrigation
city</p>
<p>developed the first schools and the first teachers. It developed the
first</p>
<p>systematic observation of natural phenomena, indeed the first ap-</p>
<p>proach to nature as something outside of and different from man
and</p>
<p>governed by its own rational and independent laws.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Finally, the irrigation city created the individual. Outside the
city,</li>
</ol>
<p>as we can still see from those tribal communities that have survived
to</p>
<p>our days, only the tribe had existence. The individual as such
was</p>
<p>neither seen nor paid attention to. In the irrigation city of
antiquity,</p>
<p>however, the individual became, of necessity, the focal point.
And</p>
<p>with this emerged not only compassion and the concept of justice;
with</p>
<p>it emerged the arts as we know them, the poets, and eventually
the</p>
<p>religions and the philosophers.</p>
<p>This is, of course, not even the barest sketch. All I wanted to</p>
<p>suggest is the scope and magnitude of social and political
innovation</p>
<p>hat underlay the rise of the irrigation civilizations. All I wanted
to</p>
<p>stress is that the irrigation city was essentially “modern“, as we
have</p>
<p>understood the term, and that until today, history largely consisted
in</p>
<p>building on the foundations laid five thousand or more years ago.
In</p>
<p>fact, one can argue that human history, in the last five thousand
years,</p>
<p>has largely been an extension of the social and political
institutions of</p>
<p>he irrigation city to larger and larger areas, that is, to all areas
on the</p>
<p>globe where water supply is adequate for the systematic tilling of
the</p>
<p>soil. In its beginnings, the irrigation city was the oasis in a
tribal,</p>
<p>nomadic world. By 1900 it was the tribal, nomadic world that had</p>
<p>become the exception.</p>
<p>The irrigation civilization was based squarely upon a
technological</p>
<p>revolution. It can with justice be called a “technological polity“.
All</p>
<p>its institutions were responses to opportunities and challenges that
new</p>
<p>echnology offered. All its institutions were essentially aimed at
mak-</p>
<p>ing the new technology most productive.</p>
<p>I hope you will allow me one diversion.</p>
<p>The history of the irrigation civilizations has yet to be written.
There</p>
<p>is a tremendous amount of material available now, where fifty
years</p>
<p>ago we had, at best, fragments. There are splendid discussions
avail-</p>
<p>able of this or that irrigation civilization, for instance of Sumer.
But</p>
<p>he very big job of recreating this great achievement of man and
of</p>
<p>elling the story of his first great civilization is yet ahead of
us.</p>
<p>This should be preeminently a job for historians of technology
such</p>
<p>as we profess to be. At the very least the job calls for a historian
with</p>
<p>The First Technological Revolution and Its Lessons 309</p>
<p>high interest in, and genuine understanding of, technology. The
essen-</p>
<p>ial theme around which this history will have to be written must be
the</p>
<p>impacts and capacities of the new technology and the opportunities
and</p>
<p>challenges which this, the first great technological revolution,
pre-</p>
<p>sented. The social, political, cultural institutions, familiar though
they</p>
<p>are to us today-for they are in large measure the institutions we
have</p>
<p>been living with for five thousand years-were all brand new then,
and</p>
<p>were all the outgrowth of new technology and of attempts to solve
the</p>
<p>problems the new technology posed.</p>
<p>It is our contention in the Society for the History of Technology
that</p>
<p>he history of technology is a major, distinct strand in the web
of</p>
<p>human history. We believe that the history of mankind cannot be</p>
<p>properly understood without relating to it the history of man’s
work</p>
<p>and man’s tools, that is, the history of technology. Some of our</p>
<p>colleagues and friends-let me mention only such familiar names as</p>
<p>Lewis Mumford, Fairfield Osborn, Joseph Needham, R. J. Forbes,</p>
<p>Cyril Stanley Smith, and Lynn White-have in their own works</p>
<p>brilliantly demonstrated the profound impact of technology on
politi-</p>
<p>cal, social, economic, and cultural history. But while
technological</p>
<p>change has always had impact on the way men live and work, surely
at</p>
<p>no other time has technology so literally shaped civilization and
culture</p>
<p>as during the first technological revolution, that is, during the
rise of</p>
<p>he irrigation civilizations of antiquity.</p>
<p>Only now, however, is it possible to tell the story. No longer can
its</p>
<p>neglect be justified. For the facts are available, as I stated
before. And</p>
<p>we now, because we live in a technological revolution ourselves,
are</p>
<p>capable of understanding what happened then-at the very dawn of</p>
<p>history. There is a big job to be done: to show that the
traditional</p>
<p>approach to our history-the approach taught in our schools-in
which</p>
<p>“relevant“ history really begins with the Greeks (or with the
Chinese</p>
<p>dynasties), is shortsighted and distorts the real “ancient
civilization“.</p>
<p>I have, however, strayed off my topic: the question I posed at
the</p>
<p>beginning, what we can learn from the first technological
revolution</p>
<p>regarding the impacts likely to result on man, his society, and
his</p>
<p>government from the new industrial revolution, the one we are
living</p>
<p>in. Does the story of the irrigation civilization show man to be
deter-</p>
<p>mined by his technical achievements, in thrall to them, coerced
by</p>
<p>hem? Or does it show him capable of using technology to his own,
to</p>
<p>human ends, and of being the master of the tools of his own
devising?</p>
<p>The answer which the irrigation civilizations give us to this
question</p>
<p>is threefold.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Without a shadow of doubt, major technological change creates</li>
</ol>
<p>he need for social and political innovation. It does make
obsolete</p>
<p>existing institutional arrangements. It does require new and very
dif-</p>
<p>ferent institutions of community, society, and government. To
this</p>
<p>extent there can be no doubt: technological change of a
revolutionary</p>
<p>character coerces; it demands innovation.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The second answer also implies a strong necessity. There is
little</li>
</ol>
<p>doubt, one would conclude from looking at the irrigation
civilizations,</p>
<p>hat specific technological changes demand equally specific social
and</p>
<p>political innovations. That the basic institutions of the irrigation
cities</p>
<p>of the Old World, despite great cultural difference, all
exhibited</p>
<p>striking similarity may not prove much. After all, there probably was
a</p>
<p>great deal of cultural diffusion (though I refuse to get into the
quick-</p>
<p>sand of debating whether Mesopotamia or China was the original</p>
<p>innovator). But the fact that the irrigation civilizations of the
New</p>
<p>World around the Lake of Mexico and in Maya Yucatan, though</p>
<p>culturally completely independent, millennia later evolved
institutions</p>
<p>which, in fundamentals, closely resemble those of the Old World</p>
<p>(e.g., an organized government with social classes and a
permanent</p>
<p>military, and writing) would argue strongly that the solutions to
spe-</p>
<p>cific conditions created by new technology have to be specific and
are,</p>
<p>herefore, limited in number and scope.</p>
<p>In other words, one lesson to be learned from the first
technological</p>
<p>revolution is that new technology creates what a philosopher of
history</p>
<p>might call “objective reality“. And objective reality has to be
dealt</p>
<p>with on its terms. Such a reality would, for instance, be the
conver-</p>
<p>sion, in the course of the first technological revolution, of human
space</p>
<p>from “habitat“ into “settlement“, that is, into a permanent
territorial</p>
<p>unit always to be found in the same place-unlike the migrating
herds</p>
<p>of pastoral people or the hunting grounds of primitive tribes.
This</p>
<p>alone made obsolete the tribe and demanded a permanent,
impersonal,</p>
<p>and rather powerful government.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>But the irrigation civilizations can teach us also that the new</li>
</ol>
<p>objective reality determines only the gross parameters of the
solutions.</p>
<p>The First Technological Revolution and Its Lessons 311</p>
<p>It determines where, and in respect to what, new institutions are</p>
<p>needed. It does not make anything “inevitable“. It leaves wide
open</p>
<p>how the new problems are to be tackled, what the purpose and
values</p>
<p>of the new institutions are to be.</p>
<p>In the irrigation civilizations of the New World the individual,
for</p>
<p>instance, failed to make his appearance. Never, as far as we know,
did</p>
<p>hese civilizations get around to separating law from custom nor,</p>
<p>despite a highly developed trade, did they invent money.</p>
<p>Even within the Old World, where one irrigation civilization
could</p>
<p>learn from the others, there were very great differences. They were
far</p>
<p>from homogeneous even though all had similar tasks to accomplish</p>
<p>and developed similar institutions for these tasks. The different
spe-</p>
<p>cific answers expressed above all different views regarding man,
his</p>
<p>position in the universe, and his society–different purposes and
great-</p>
<p>ly differing values.</p>
<p>Impersonal bureaucratic government had to arise in all these
civili-</p>
<p>zations; without it they could not have functioned. But in the Near
East</p>
<p>it was seen at a very early stage that such a government could
serve</p>
<p>equally to exploit and hold down the common man and to establish</p>
<p>justice for all and protection for the weak. From the beginning the
Near</p>
<p>East saw an ethical decision as crucial to government. In Egypt,</p>
<p>however, this decision was never seen. The question of the purpose
of</p>
<p>government was never asked. And the central quest of government
in</p>
<p>China was not justice but harmony.</p>
<p>It was in Egypt that the individual first emerged, as witness the</p>
<p>many statues, portraits, and writings of professional men, such
as</p>
<p>scribes and administrators, that have come down to us-most of
them</p>
<p>superbly aware of the uniqueness of the individual and clearly
assert-</p>
<p>ing his primacy. It is early Egypt, for instance, which records
the</p>
<p>names of architects who built the great pyramids. We have no
names</p>
<p>for the equally great architects of the castles and palaces of Assur
or</p>
<p>Babylon, let alone for the early architects of China. But Egypt
sup-</p>
<p>pressed the individual after a fairly short period during which
he</p>
<p>flowered (perhaps as part of the reaction against the dangerous
heresies</p>
<p>of Ikhnaton). There is no individual left in the records of the
Middle</p>
<p>and New Kingdoms, which perhaps explains their relative
sterility.</p>
<p>In the other areas two entirely different basic approaches
emerged.</p>
<p>One, that of Mesopotamia and of the Taoists, we might call
“personal-</p>
<p>ism“, the approach that found its greatest expression later in
the</p>
<p>Hebrew prophets and in the Greek dramatists. Here the stress is
on</p>
<p>developing to the fullest the capacities of the person. In the
other</p>
<p>approach-we might call it “rationalism“, taught and exemplified</p>
<p>above all by Confucius-the aim is the moulding and shaping of the</p>
<p>individual according to preestablished ideals of rightness and
perfec-</p>
<p>ion. I need not tell you that both these approaches still permeate
our</p>
<p>hinking about education.</p>
<p>Or take the military. Organized defense was a necessity for the</p>
<p>irrigation civilization. But three different approaches emerged: a
sepa-</p>
<p>rate military class supported through tribute by the producing class,
the</p>
<p>farmers; the citizen-army drafted from the peasantry itself; and
merce-</p>
<p>naries. There is very little doubt that from the beginning it was
clearly</p>
<p>understood that each of these three approaches had very real
political</p>
<p>consequences. It is hardly coincidence, I believe, that Egypt,
origi-</p>
<p>nally unified by overthrowing local, petty chieftains, never
developed</p>
<p>afterwards a professional permanent military class.</p>
<p>Even the class structure, though it characterizes all irrigation
civili-</p>
<p>zations, showed great differences from culture to culture and
within</p>
<p>he same culture at different times. It was being used to create
perma-</p>
<p>nent castes and complete social immobility, but it was also used
with</p>
<p>great skill to create a very high degree of social mobility and a
substan-</p>
<p>ial measure of opportunities for the gifted and ambitious.</p>
<p>Or take science. We now know that no early civilization excelled</p>
<p>China in the quality and quantity of scientific observations. And yet
we</p>
<p>also know that early Chinese culture did not point towards anything
we</p>
<p>could call science. Perhaps because of their rationalism the
Chinese</p>
<p>refrained from generalization. And though fanciful and speculative,
it</p>
<p>is the generalizations of the Near East and the mathematics of
Egypt</p>
<p>which point the way towards systematic science. The Chinese, with</p>
<p>heir superb gift for accurate observation, could obtain an
enormous</p>
<p>amount of information about nature. But their view of the
universe</p>
<p>remained totally unaffected thereby-in sharp contrast to what we</p>
<p>know about the Middle Eastern developments out of which Europe</p>
<p>arose.</p>
<p>In brief, the history of man’s first technological revolution
indicates</p>
<p>he following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Technological revolutions create an objective need for social
and</li>
</ol>
<p>The First Technological Revolution and Its Lessons 313</p>
<p>political innovations. They create a need also for identifying the
areas</p>
<p>in which new institutions are needed and old ones are becoming</p>
<p>obsolete.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The new institutions have to be appropriate to specific new
needs.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are right social and political responses to technology and
wrong</p>
<p>social and political responses. To the extent that only a right
institu-</p>
<p>ional response will do, society and government are largely
circum-</p>
<p>scribed by new technology.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>But the values these institutions attempt to realize, the human
and</li>
</ol>
<p>social purposes to which they are applied, and, perhaps most
impor-</p>
<p>ant, the emphasis and stress laid on one purpose as against
another,</p>
<p>are largely within human control. The bony structure, the hard stuff
of</p>
<p>a society, is prescribed by the tasks it has to accomplish. But the
ethos</p>
<p>of the society is in man’s hands and is largely a matter of the
“how“</p>
<p>rather than of the “what.“</p>
<p>For the first time in thousands of years, we face again a situation
that</p>
<p>can be compared with what our remote ancestors faced at the time
of</p>
<p>he irrigation civilization. It is not only the speed of
technological</p>
<p>change that creates a revolution, it is its scope as well. Above
all,</p>
<p>oday, as seven thousand years ago, technological developments
from</p>
<p>a great many areas are growing together to create a new human</p>
<p>environment. This has not been true of any period between the
first</p>
<p>echnological revolution and the technological revolution that got
un-</p>
<p>der way two hundred years ago and has still clearly not run its
course.</p>
<p>We, therefore, face a big task of identifying the areas in which</p>
<p>social and political innovations are needed. We face a big task
in</p>
<p>developing the institutions for the new tasks, institutions adequate
to</p>
<p>he new needs and to the new capacities which technological change
is</p>
<p>casting up. And, finally, we face the biggest task of them all, the
task</p>
<p>of ensuring that the new institutions embody the values we believe
in,</p>
<p>aspire to the purposes we consider right, and serve human
freedom,</p>
<p>human dignity, and human ends.</p>
<p>If an educated man of those days of the first technological
revolu-</p>
<p>ion-an educated Sumerian perhaps or an educated ancient Chinese-</p>
<p>looked at us today, he would certainly be totally stumped by our</p>
<p>echnology. But he would, I am sure, find our existing social and</p>
<p>political institutions reasonably familiar-they are after all, by
and</p>
<p>large, not fundamentally different from the institutions he and
his</p>
<p>contemporaries first fashioned. And, I am quite certain, he would
have</p>
<p>nothing but a wry smile for both those among us who predict a</p>
<p>echnological heaven and those who predict a technological hell of</p>
<p>“alienation“, of “technological unemployment“, and so on. He</p>
<p>might well mutter to himself, “This is where I came in.“ But to us
he</p>
<p>might well say, “A time such as was mine and such as is yours, a
time</p>
<p>of true technological revolution, is not a time for exultation. It is
not a</p>
<p>ime for despair either. It is a time for work and for
responsibility.“</p>
