<h4 id="japan-the-problems-of-success">Japan: The Problems of
Success</h4>
<p>Everyone I met in Japan last fall, during my tenth long trip to
that</p>
<p>country in eighteen years, talked economics and only economics.
Even</p>
<p>he theoretical mathematician and the elderly abbot of the famous
Zen</p>
<p>emple were obsessed with the dollarlyen exchange rate, the export</p>
<p>surplus, and the cost of petroleum. Japan is indeed undergoing
trau-</p>
<p>matic economic changes. Yet the basic issues facing Japan are not
eco-</p>
<p>nomic. They are changes in social structure and social values.
Social</p>
<p>policies that have served Japan superbly well for a century are
rapidly</p>
<p>becoming untenable. These policies were designed to change Japan</p>
<p>from a poor, and poorly educated, rural society with low life
expectan-</p>
<p>cies into a wealthy, highly educated, industrial society with high
life</p>
<p>expectancies. Their very success is rendering them obsolete and
is</p>
<p>urning them into dangers to Japan’s social cohesion and her ability
to</p>
<p>compete economically.</p>
<p>This is true with respect to the Japanese seniority-wage system,</p>
<p>under which incomes of all three kinds of employees-manual work-</p>
<p>ers, clerks, and managers and professionals-are determined solely,
or</p>
<p>at least primarily, by length of service, with an employee at the</p>
<p>entrance level getting about one-third of what the same employee,</p>
<p>regardless of his job or title, will receive as income after
twenty-five</p>
<p>years of service, that is, in his forties. But equally obsolescent
is</p>
<p>Japan’s traditional linkage of education to career opportunities,
under</p>
<p>First published in Foreign Affair, 1978.</p>
<p>which people who finish their formal schooling with “middle
school,“</p>
<p>hat is, at age fifteen, are slotted for a lifetime as manual workers
in</p>
<p>manufacturing, farming, or service work; with high school
graduates</p>
<p>becoming clerks or technicians for their entire working life; and
with</p>
<p>university graduates becoming managers and professionals-and with</p>
<p>practically no crossover from one group into the other. The
employee’s</p>
<p>lifetime commitment to one employer and one place of employment-</p>
<p>often, and misleadingly, called “lifetime employment“-may equally</p>
<p>urn into a serious threat to social harmony, rather than remain
its</p>
<p>strongest pillar. And equally untenable by now is the policy, as old
as</p>
<p>“modern Japan,“ of preventing social dislocation by using
economic</p>
<p>measures to shield the social order of the “old Japan“ while building
a</p>
<p>radically different “new Japan. “</p>
<p>The villain is not the petroleum cartel, Japan’s dependence on
raw</p>
<p>material imports, or the “world recession“-the monsters of
today’s</p>
<p>popular Japanese demonology. If the world recession were really
the</p>
<p>serious threat to Japan that almost any Japanese maintains it to
be,</p>
<p>Japan could hardly export enormous quantities of advanced and
tech-</p>
<p>nologically complex near-luxuries, such as motor cars, color
television</p>
<p>sets and calculators, to practically every market in the
noncommunist</p>
<p>world. And while Japan’s petroleum bill has, of course, gone up</p>
<p>sharply since 1973, her bill for all industrial raw materials,
including</p>
<p>petroleum and petroleum products, has actually gone down as a
per-</p>
<p>centage both of industrial production and of gross national
product.</p>
<p>For the petroleum cartel has had the impact cartels always have
had,</p>
<p>and have been known to have for over seventy years, since a
German</p>
<p>economist, Arthur Spiethoff, first studied cartels around the turn of
the</p>
<p>century. Every cartel depresses the prices of other goods competing
for</p>
<p>a share of the same income category-for example, other raw mate-</p>
<p>rials in the case of petroleum-by as much as, if not by more than,
the</p>
<p>percentage increase in the price of the product the cartel controls.
The</p>
<p>drop in raw material prices is altogether a major contributory cause
of</p>
<p>Japan’s record balance-of-trade surplus. Since Japan imports
virtually</p>
<p>all her raw materials, and since petroleum is a fairly small fraction
of</p>
<p>otal material needs-less than ten percent-Japan, in her terms of</p>
<p>rade and in her balance of payments, has actually benefited from
the</p>
<p>Japan: The Problems of Success 383</p>
<p>high petroleum price and from the resulting depression in the price
of</p>
<p>all other raw materials. (Conversely, the fact that the United States
is</p>
<p>most nearly self-sufficient of all major developed countries in
raw</p>
<p>materials means that it is the country hardest hit in its trade
accounts by</p>
<p>higher petroleum prices. We pay more for imported petroleum while</p>
<p>getting less for the raw materials that we produce for export.)</p>
<p>Rather, the villain in Japan’s story-if “villain“ be the right
word</p>
<p>-is Japan’s population dynamics, and especially Japan’s great
success</p>
<p>in raising life spans faster than any country has ever done
before.</p>
<p>Seventy-five years ago, the average life expectancy was age
forty-two.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, it was still only fifty-three. It was, therefore,
com-</p>
<p>pletely realistic for the Japanese to set their “official“ retirement
age</p>
<p>in government service at age fifty-five in the 1880s and to extend
this</p>
<p>retirement age to most private employees in the 1920s. Japanese
life</p>
<p>expectancies, by now, are seventy-three for men and seventy-eight
for</p>
<p>women-the same as in the West. Infant mortality rates in Japan
fell</p>
<p>sharply in the 1920s to the low levels of the developed West. But
the</p>
<p>birthrate stayed high until World War 11. And after World War 11,</p>
<p>Japan, very much like the United States or Western Europe,
experi-</p>
<p>enced a short-lived, but sharp, “baby boom.“ A policy that based
eco-</p>
<p>nomic growth on a large supply of young workers-the policy that
is</p>
<p>expressed in the seniority-wage system-therefore made abundant</p>
<p>sense as late as 1965. But the “baby boom“ in Japan ended in a
“baby</p>
<p>bust“ in the mid-1950s-some six years before a similar “baby
bust“</p>
<p>in the United States and ten years before the birthrate dropped
sharply</p>
<p>in Germany. And as in the West, the birthrate in Japan has stayed at,
or</p>
<p>below, the net reproduction level ever since.</p>
<p>As late as 1946, at the end of World War 11, three-fifths of the</p>
<p>Japanese population lived on the land and almost half the labor
force</p>
<p>worked in farming, and yet Japan had to import rice. Japan reacted
by</p>
<p>giving top priority to higher rice production regardless of costs.
Japan</p>
<p>has more than doubled her farm output in the last thirty years and
has</p>
<p>an unsalable rice surplus. Yet only one-eighth of the Japanese
popula-</p>
<p>ion now lives on the farm, and less than one-twelfth of the labor
force</p>
<p>is employed in farming.</p>
<p>The Japanese people have shifted drastically the educational
struc-</p>
<p>ure of the population. As late as 1938-the last “normal“ year
before</p>
<p>Japan began to mobilize for war-only 4 to 5 percent of the young</p>
<p>men—one of every twenty-went to the university, and half of the</p>
<p>young men went to work after graduating from middle school.
Today,</p>
<p>more than half of the young men go to the university. There are</p>
<p>literally no middle-school leavers of either sex. Practically
every</p>
<p>Japanese, whether male or female, goes on to high school. Yet
Japan’s</p>
<p>social structures and policies still push heavily the expansion of
college</p>
<p>education.</p>
<p>In 1970, less than ten years ago, Japan was still the youngest of
all</p>
<p>developed countries. People over sixty-five amounted to less than
7</p>
<p>percent of the population, which meant that only one out of every</p>
<p>fifteen Japanese was sixty-five years or older. And for every
Japanese</p>
<p>over sixty-five, there were about seven to eight adult Japanese
em-</p>
<p>ployed and working. The comparable U.S. figures for 1970 were 10</p>
<p>percent of the population over sixty-five and five people in the
labor</p>
<p>force for every one past retirement age. In Sweden and France, the
two</p>
<p>oldest Western countries, the comparable figures were then 12
percent</p>
<p>and one retired to three-and-a-half working people, respectively.
By</p>
<p>1977, Japan had moved to the U. S. level of 1970. By 1990, just a</p>
<p>little more than ten years hence, Japan will be beyond the
Swedish</p>
<p>level of 1970 and will have close to 15 percent of her population in
the</p>
<p>over-sixty-five age bracket, with a ratio of only three people in
the</p>
<p>labor force to every one over sixty-five and past traditional
Western</p>
<p>retirement age. Japan will, by then, be one of the very oldest of
the</p>
<p>developed countries-somewhat holder even than the United States
is</p>
<p>likely to be.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of Japanese who reach retirement age</p>
<p>now are middle-school graduates who therefore have spent their
entire</p>
<p>working lives as manual workers. At least half the males entering
the</p>
<p>labor force in Japan are now university graduates and too highly</p>
<p>schooled to be employed in any but managerial or professional
jobs.’</p>
<p>At the same time, the reservoir of surplus labor on the farm
available</p>
<p>for manufacturing and service jobs in the cities has by now
completely</p>
<p>dried up.</p>
<p>Similar developments have taken place in every single developed</p>
<p>country. However, they have taken place much faster in Japan than
in</p>
<p>he West-much faster than in any country on record. The
transforma-</p>
<p>ion of the Japanese age structure, for instance, required
twenty-five</p>
<p>Japan: The Problems of Success 385</p>
<p>years. The same transformation took seventy years in the United</p>
<p>States, 100 years in Germany, and 200 years in France. The
education-</p>
<p>al shift that Japan performed in thirty years took well over sixty
years</p>
<p>in the United States and a century in Western Europe. And the
shift</p>
<p>hat Japan performed in thirty years, from a near-majority of the
labor</p>
<p>force employed in farming to agriculture being the employer of
the</p>
<p>smallest group in the working population, took almost a century in
the</p>
<p>United States and is not yet complete in some West European coun-</p>
<p>ries.</p>
<p>Above all, the impact of these shifts is infinitely greater in
Japan</p>
<p>han in any country in the West. For the basic policies on which</p>
<p>Japan’s society is based presume yesterday’s age structure,
yesterday’s</p>
<p>educational structure, yesterday’s rural society, and yesterday’s
con-</p>
<p>sumption pattern.</p>
<p>In particular, Japan’s economic growth and competitive strength
are</p>
<p>based on the availability of large numbers of manual workers at
the</p>
<p>entrance age-that is, on the availability of young middle-school</p>
<p>graduates. Under the seniority-wage system, productivity automat-</p>
<p>ically increases, the more young people are being employed. It
makes</p>
<p>little sense to talk of an “average Japanese wage“ or “average
Japa-</p>
<p>nese labor costs.“ Two plants of the same company, using the same</p>
<p>equipment and the same methods, turning out the same products and</p>
<p>paying exactly the same wages and benefits to workers of the same</p>
<p>age, may still have labor-cost differentials of 100 percent,
depending</p>
<p>on the age distribution of their work force. For every year by which
the</p>
<p>average age of the labor force in a plant goes up, the plant’s labor
costs</p>
<p>rise by 5 to 7 percent.</p>
<p>This explains why Japanese businesses have put the emphasis on</p>
<p>sales volume and have seemed to neglect profitability. If sales
volume</p>
<p>goes up sufficiently so that young people in large numbers can be</p>
<p>hired, profitability takes care of itself. Conversely, if sales
volume</p>
<p>does not go up, or goes down, so that no young workers can be
hired,</p>
<p>profitability will inexorably go down-no matter how high the
profit</p>
<p>margin. And now Japan faces a period in which the labor force
will</p>
<p>inevitably become older. The more labor-intensive any particular
Japa-</p>
<p>nese industry is-and even the most modern steel mill is still
highly</p>
<p>labor-intensive-the more serious will be the drop in productivity
from</p>
<p>population dynamics.</p>
<p>No one, to my knowledge, has tried to separate productivity in-</p>
<p>creases in Japanese industry that resulted from improved working</p>
<p>methods and modernization from productivity increases that
resulted</p>
<p>from population dynamics. The best guesses I can find credit
popula-</p>
<p>ion dynamics with about half of the productivity increases of the
last</p>
<p>wenty years. For during these last twenty years, young people
were</p>
<p>available in very large numbers, as a result of the “baby boom“ and
of</p>
<p>he large-scale migration of young people from the farms into the</p>
<p>cities. On that basis, real productivity growth in Japanese
industry-as</p>
<p>against the impact of population dynamics-would work out at no</p>
<p>more than 5 to 7 percent a year for the postwar period-still
respect-</p>
<p>able by any Western standard, but barely enough to offset the
down-</p>
<p>urn in productivity caused by the imminent aging of the Japanese</p>
<p>labor force. And for Japan to maintain her competitive position
against</p>
<p>such newcomers as South Korea or Brazil, with their lower labor
costs,</p>
<p>would obviously require an even greater growth rate in real
produc-</p>
<p>ivity.</p>
<p>This leads to what would appear to be an insoluble growth dilemma</p>
<p>for Japan. A growth rate of 6 percent is the minimum for Japan to</p>
<p>sustain her competitive position in the world, given the
seniority-wage</p>
<p>system and its impact on productivities and competitive position.
But</p>
<p>he Japanese population, and especially the population available
for</p>
<p>manual work-that is the middle-school leavers-is not going to
grow</p>
<p>at anywhere near that rate. A 6 percent growth rate in the
traditional</p>
<p>industries is simply not sustainable on the basis of available
manpower</p>
<p>and existing retirement policies.</p>
<p>But the population dynamics also threaten Japan’s traditional
capital</p>
<p>supply. Japan has, for 100 years, had the highest rate of savings
and</p>
<p>capital formation of any industrial country in the world, with
personal</p>
<p>savings of 35 percent of gross personal income being the norm
rather</p>
<p>han the exception. This, too, very largely rested on the simple
fact</p>
<p>hat until recently few Japanese survived to retirement age. We
have</p>
<p>learned, in the West, that as life expectancies go up, capital
formation</p>
<p>inexorably goes down. A larger and larger share of personal
savings</p>
<p>becomes “transfer payments“ to the older retired people and to
“sur-</p>
<p>vivors,“ that is widows of retirees who have died. These
“transfer</p>
<p>payments,“ through social security taxes and through payments
into</p>
<p>employers’ pensions funds, look like savings. But older
people-that</p>
<p>is the recipients of these “savingsm–do not save; they consume.</p>
<p>Japan: The Problems of Success 387</p>
<p>Japanese government economists calculate that the Japanese
person-</p>
<p>al savings rate would be lower by at least one-third, if not a full
half-</p>
<p>hat is, it would run at 17-24 percent of gross personal income-if</p>
<p>Japan today had the same age structure the United States has,
where</p>
<p>here are 32 million people who are on social security, including
eight</p>
<p>million “survivors,“ as against a working population of 92
million.</p>
<p>This would still be one of the highest savings rates in the world,
and on</p>
<p>a par with those of West Germany and Switzerland. But it would be
a</p>
<p>low savings rate for Japan, and perhaps too low a savings rate in
the</p>
<p>light of Japan’s future needs. For Japan, to offset the impact on</p>
<p>productivity of an aging labor force under the seniority-wage
system,</p>
<p>will have to step up capital investment tremendously to obtain the
real</p>
<p>productivity increases she needs to remain competitive. Yet
capital</p>
<p>formation will almost certainly drop sharply, just when Japan
needs</p>
<p>capital formation the most.</p>
<p>There is one category of young people in which Japan will experi-</p>
<p>ence no shortage: university-educated people, prepared to be
managers</p>
<p>or professionals, either in the private or the public sector. In
fact, there</p>
<p>is already a surplus. Despite the sharp drop in the birthrate, the
supply</p>
<p>of university-educated young people in Japan during the next ten
years</p>
<p>will be many times what is was only twenty years ago. It is still
likely</p>
<p>o increase, for a university degree is the only way to have
career</p>
<p>opportunities in Japan.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers will thus be Japan’s major, and most important,</p>
<p>resource. And Japan’s economic strategy will increasingly have to
be</p>
<p>o export knowledge work and its fruits, rather than manual work
and</p>
<p>its fruits. Increasingly, Japan will have to go in for the form
of</p>
<p>economic integration that, for want of a better term, I have
called</p>
<p>’production-sharing“-that is, for economic integration under
which</p>
<p>he developed country performs those stages in the productive
process</p>
<p>hat are management-intensive, capital-intensive, and
technology-in-</p>
<p>ensive, while the abundant labor resources of young manual
workers</p>
<p>in the developing country perform the stages that are
labor-intensive,</p>
<p>with the final product sold and consumed in the large markets, that
is</p>
<p>in the developed countries. Japan, alone of all the developed
countries,</p>
<p>has seen the need for systematic work on “production-sharing.“
The</p>
<p>Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITT), several
years</p>
<p>ago, switched to a policy of encouraging the export of entire
manufac-</p>
<p>uring plants rather than of the products of such plants. And
while</p>
<p>MITI so far still expects these plants, for example, a
petrochemical</p>
<p>plant designed and built by Japanese in Algeria, to sell its products
in</p>
<p>other markets, MITI is increasingly willing to accept payment for
such</p>
<p>a plant in the products of the plant-that is, payment for the
Japanese-</p>
<p>designed and Japanese-built petrochemical plant in Algeria in the
form</p>
<p>of petrochemicals to be sold in Japan.</p>
<p>Increasingly, this will mean that Japanese managers and
profession-</p>
<p>als will design, build and perhaps manage consumer goods plants
in</p>
<p>developing countries-plants for shoes, textiles, automobiles and
elec-</p>
<p>ronic products-that are going to be paid for by their own output,
to</p>
<p>be sold to the Japanese consumer in Japan. It is hard to see any
other</p>
<p>way of finding employment for the one resource in which Japan
will</p>
<p>have a continuing surplus-that is, highly schooled people,
qualified</p>
<p>under the Japanese system only for managerial and professional
work.</p>
<p>Such a policy is obviously exceedingly difficult in any country,
and</p>
<p>likely to run into determined opposition on the part of unions,
old</p>
<p>industries and politicians alike. It is doubly difficult in Japan
because</p>
<p>of the traditional policy under which the employee is committed to
one</p>
<p>employer and cannot easily find other employment, once he is past
the</p>
<p>entrance age. Under the Japanese seniority-wage system, an
employ-</p>
<p>ee, and especially a low-paid and low-skilled employee, such as a</p>
<p>manual worker, cannot normally find a job past age thirty or
thirty-</p>
<p>five. At that age, he would have to be paid twice the entrance
wage.</p>
<p>But since wage is based on seniority, he can only be paid the
entrance</p>
<p>wage. He is, therefore, basically unemployable. If he loses his job,
he</p>
<p>becomes a “problem worker,“ very much the way in which the</p>
<p>samurai of old became a ronin and reduced to banditry if his lord</p>
<p>dismissed him or if the lord lost his fief. The worker of thirty-five
who</p>
<p>loses his job cannot, normally, expect to become a “permanent em-</p>
<p>ployee“ anyplace. He becomes a “casual employee,“ who will never</p>
<p>again have employment security, never again have seniority, never</p>
<p>again have a good job, and never again, in fact, work for a major</p>
<p>company.</p>
<p>“Lifetime employment,“ that is the right of the worker to his
job,</p>
<p>Japan: The Problems of Success 389</p>
<p>developed as an answer to the burden that lifetime commitment to
the</p>
<p>job imposed on the Japanese worker. At that, only about one-quarter
of</p>
<p>he Japanese labor force has the security of lifetime employment.</p>
<p>Women, by definition, are “temporary employees, “ who are
expected</p>
<p>o leave the labor force when they marry-and are expected to many</p>
<p>by their mid-twenties. And employees in the “old industries’’-that
is</p>
<p>in the service industries, the small shops, the small artisans’
factories</p>
<p>and on the farm-have no lifetime employment either. It is
reserved</p>
<p>for the male employees in government and large businesses-and is</p>
<p>not even universal there. But precisely because of the Japanese
work-</p>
<p>er’s constant and nagging fear of becoming a ronin, lifetime
employ-</p>
<p>ment has been the core of Japanese labor relations and the pillar
of</p>
<p>social order and harmony in Japan.</p>
<p>Now it is rapidly becoming a threat, both to the Japanese worker
and</p>
<p>o Japanese society. But any effort to change the system would not</p>
<p>only cause the labor unions directly involved to fight very hard
indeed</p>
<p>in opposition, but would engage a host of other groups that are in
one</p>
<p>way or another taken care of by the economic enterprises or
institutions</p>
<p>in which they work, albeit on a basis that falls short of strict
lifetime</p>
<p>employment. In essence, the practice reflects a whole concept of</p>
<p>responsibility in the society, as well as a symbol of fairness.
Any</p>
<p>attempt to modify or to eliminate it would strike at deep
emotional</p>
<p>roots throughout Japanese society.</p>
<p>Today, to deploy her one abundant resource-highly educated peo-</p>
<p>ple-Japan needs to be able to liquidate fast the most
labor-intensive</p>
<p>and least productive stages of production, that is, old low-skill
indus-</p>
<p>ries. But these industries-whether textile industries or shoe
facto-</p>
<p>ries-are, of course, precisely the industries that employ the
largest</p>
<p>number of low-skilled and older workers. Even without the barrier
to</p>
<p>reemployment that lifetime employment and the seniority-wage
system</p>
<p>ogether create, these workers, while relatively small in numbers,</p>
<p>would present a serious economic and social problem. These
workers</p>
<p>will, of necessity, cling the more tenaciously to lifetime
employment,</p>
<p>he less productive they and their industries become. Yet, unless
they</p>
<p>can move out of their old employments and into new ones, Japan
will</p>
<p>find it increasingly difficult to find work for the tremendous
potential</p>
<p>of highly schooled knowledge workers who constitute Japan’s major</p>
<p>and potentially most productive capital investment.</p>
<p>The alternative-and one that is hardly realistic anymore-is dump-</p>
<p>ing high-cost , labor-intensive products, at a loss, in foreign
markets</p>
<p>hat are bound to have surplus capacity and redundant over-aged
labor</p>
<p>in precisely the same industries as Japan.</p>
<p>No other country has had as purposeful and as successful an
educa-</p>
<p>ional policy as has Japan. That career opportunities are
dependent</p>
<p>almost entirely on educational attainment was deliberate and
planned.</p>
<p>It was meant to make economic progress the engine of educational</p>
<p>advancqment. A famous story is told of Shibusawa Eiichi (1840-</p>
<p>1931), the Meiji statesman who left a high government post to
become</p>
<p>Japan’s leading industrial entrepreneur and her first banker.
When</p>
<p>approached for a loan by a successful businessman, Shibusawa
turned</p>
<p>he application down because the man was not a university
graduate.</p>
<p>This was not snobbery. And Shibusawa knew perfectly well that</p>
<p>success in business does not depend on a sheepskin. But he had</p>
<p>decided earlier to make managerial positions the monopoly of
univer-</p>
<p>sity graduates so as to give young Japanese an incentive to stay
in</p>
<p>school and to acquire higher education.</p>
<p>As a result, Japan has become the only genuine “meritocracy“</p>
<p>around, in which birth and wealth count for almost nothing and</p>
<p>educational attainment for almost everything. By now this has
outlived</p>
<p>its usefulness. School is turning into a nightmare. There is
increasingly</p>
<p>an oversupply of university graduates. But this has not, at least so
far,</p>
<p>resulted in a lessening of the pressure on young people to get into
the</p>
<p>right educational track and to acquire the university degree that is
the</p>
<p>passport to all opportunity and preferment.</p>
<p>On the contrary, during the last few years the pressure has reached
a</p>
<p>fever pitch. It now begins with the child’s application to
nursery</p>
<p>school, that is before the age of three. There is an entrance
exam-</p>
<p>ination-and little tots, barely able to walk, are being pushed
into</p>
<p>aking ballet lessons, into learning arithmetic, and into learning a
few</p>
<p>words of English. And the pressure keeps on building up. More
than</p>
<p>half of all middle-school students in Japan attend juku-afternoon
and</p>
<p>evening cram schools that drill for the exams. According to a
study</p>
<p>hat the Ministry of Education released last fall, middle-school
stu-</p>
<p>Japan: The Problems of Success 391</p>
<p>dents aged twelve to fifteen spend almost nine hours each day
after</p>
<p>school doing homework and going to the juku. It is normal for a</p>
<p>middle-school child to work until two o’clock in the morning each
day,</p>
<p>and to take a sample test of the high school examinations every
Sunday</p>
<p>for years on end. Senior high school students spend “only“ eight</p>
<p>hours a day in after-school work and juku. The pressure is
becoming</p>
<p>more and more intense with the suicide rate among teenagers, and
even</p>
<p>among preteens, reaching alarming proportions.</p>
<p>But worse, school instead of being accessible to everyone on the</p>
<p>basis of merit is becoming increasingly expensive. To be sure,
school</p>
<p>-from kindergarten on-is nominally free. But to get into the
“right“</p>
<p>school requires larger and larger “voluntary contributions. “ The
most</p>
<p>expensive school to get into is medical school. A candidate, even if
his</p>
<p>father is a physician, will have to pay about 00,000 in
“voluntary</p>
<p>gifts“ and “voluntary presents“ to the faculty members on the
admis-</p>
<p>sions’ committee to have his application even considered. A friend
of</p>
<p>mine, the widow of a Japanese clergyman, who is working as an</p>
<p>administrative assistant in a small government agency, will have
to</p>
<p>find ,000 by next April to have her son admitted to the entrance</p>
<p>examination of a supposedly free public high school. If he fails,
she</p>
<p>will not get the money back-and only one out of every ten
candidates</p>
<p>passes. Then the boy will have to go for a year to a juku-at a cost
of</p>
<p>about ,500-pay another ,000 in “voluntary contributions“ and</p>
<p>ry again. And the Ministry of Education study referred to above</p>
<p>makes clear that these are not unusual but, on the contrary,
fairly</p>
<p>standard fees and financial contributions. For not to get into
the</p>
<p>“right“ high school means not to get into the “right“ university
four</p>
<p>years later; this would debar the boy forever from access to better
jobs</p>
<p>and career opportunities. Not to go to high school at all is a
life</p>
<p>sentence to manual labor, from which there is no appeal.</p>
<p>At the same time, the rewards are beginning to lose their luster.</p>
<p>With the shortage of middle-school leavers, and therefore of
manual</p>
<p>workers, and the abundance of university graduates, the differential
in</p>
<p>he pay of the two groups is bound to shrink. In the 1950s and
1960s,</p>
<p>when the demand for university graduates was high while the
supply</p>
<p>was still low, the differential became greater than it had been
tradi-</p>
<p>ionally. It is already back to where it was before World War 11. It
is</p>
<p>bound to go down, and fairly rapidly. University graduates are
already</p>
<p>beginning to have difficulty finding “good“ jobs, and in many
cases</p>
<p>jobs of any kind–especially if they have no technical
qualifications.</p>
<p>And while the salaries of university graduates, once they have
found</p>
<p>employment, still go up with seniority, the promotional
opportunities</p>
<p>are rapidly shrinking as most organizations find themselves well
sup-</p>
<p>plied with highly schooled people in their early and
mid-thirties.</p>
<p>Again the lifetime employment system aggravates the problem. The</p>
<p>university graduate can, as a rule, not leave the employer with
whom</p>
<p>he starts. And more and more of the graduates even of the
“prestige“</p>
<p>universities have to start in dead-end jobs with employers who have
no</p>
<p>future themselves-without hope of being able to switch jobs, no</p>
<p>matter how well they perform. For the time being, these conditions
are</p>
<p>likely to increase the premium on going to the “right“ schools,
and</p>
<p>with it both the emotional and the financial pressures. But there is
a</p>
<p>distinct possibility of a collapse of the system, or of an
explosion-and</p>
<p>surely a system that puts such extreme pressure on children and</p>
<p>literally forbids them to have any leisure time, any interests of
their</p>
<p>own, any learning of their own, can hardly produce educated adults.
It</p>
<p>is likely to produce people who can take examinations, but who do
not</p>
<p>know how to learn.2</p>
<p>Japan is considered the most “protectionist“ country by foreign-</p>
<p>ers-and of all the complaints foreigners have about Japan, this is
the</p>
<p>one the Japanese themselves understand the least. For, what to
the</p>
<p>foreigner seems to be economic protection, appears to the Japanese
to</p>
<p>be self-defense of Japanese society against the Westerner’s
cultural</p>
<p>imperialism.</p>
<p>From the early days of “modern Japan,“after the Meiji Restoration</p>
<p>of 1867, Japan has always defined her policy as using Western
instru-</p>
<p>mentalities to maintain the essence of Japan. And economic policy
is</p>
<p>he foremost Western instrumentality thus used. “Old Japan“ means</p>
<p>he distribution system in which large numbers of people are
employed</p>
<p>at rather low wages by small wholesalers, in “Papa, Mama and</p>
<p>Rosie“ retail shops, and in small workshops making traditional
goods</p>
<p>and acting as suppliers to modem industry. It also means a system
of</p>
<p>small family farms growing rice. But while there was once a
cultural</p>
<p>Japan: The Problems of Success 393</p>
<p>rationale for the farm policy, it has long become economic
insanity.</p>
<p>The underlying economic premises of Japan’s farm policy are the
fear</p>
<p>of a rice shortage; the belief that a country as dependent as Japan
on</p>
<p>imported raw materials has to keep as large as possible a proportion
of</p>
<p>he population on the farm and out of the consumer society; the</p>
<p>conviction that as poor a country as Japan has to discourage its
people</p>
<p>from eating anything but rice and fish; and finally the notion that
the</p>
<p>fish catch is capable of being expanded indefinitely while the rice
crop</p>
<p>is finite and will always be inadequate. All these premises have
been</p>
<p>proven fallacies during the last ten years.</p>
<p>It has been Japanese farm policy to encourage rice growing and to</p>
<p>discourage growing anything else. A Japanese farmer gets a large</p>
<p>subsidy, the less suitable his land is for growing rice. The origin
of this</p>
<p>policy was the fear that Japan could not produce enough rice for
her</p>
<p>own domestic demands-which was still a rational fear twenty-five</p>
<p>years ago. By now the policy has produced an unmanageable rice</p>
<p>surplus, while at the same time the cost of the rice subsidy has
become</p>
<p>so high that the rice subsidy fund has become bankrupt. And since
the</p>
<p>rice that the subsidy produces is grown on land not suitable for</p>
<p>growing rice, the surplus rice is of poor quality and could not
possibly</p>
<p>be sold on the world market. In respect to proteins, Japan has
similarly</p>
<p>pursued a policy that, however rational its origins, has become
bank-</p>
<p>rupt. It has been national policy to encourage fishing and to
discourage</p>
<p>and to penalize every other production of proteins, whether
vegetable,</p>
<p>such as oil-bearing crops, or animal, such as livestock or poultry.
But</p>
<p>he fishing yield has long been stagnant and is now going down
fast,</p>
<p>with the growing resistance of other nations against Japanese
fishing</p>
<p>practices that threaten to overfish and to destroy the fish
population of</p>
<p>major fishing zones. The extension of sovereignty, and with it
the</p>
<p>control of fishing 200 miles from the shore, which by now has
become</p>
<p>general, was directed in large measure against the Japanese threat
to</p>
<p>marine ecology, whether real or perceived.</p>
<p>These policies were designed to ensure low-cost food for Japan-</p>
<p>hey have had the opposite effect for at least ten years now. Japan
has,</p>
<p>without doubt, the highest food costs of any major country-twice</p>
<p>hose of the United States and perhaps 50 percent higher than those
of</p>
<p>he most expensive and most protectionist countries of Western Eu-</p>
<p>rope. Meat costs about four times what it costs in the United States
or</p>
<p>in Western Europe-and even twice what it costs in the Soviet bloc</p>
<p>countries. Fish, at the same time, has become almost as expensive
as</p>
<p>meat, and food costs are still rising fast. The Japanese inflation
rate in</p>
<p>he last few years has rarely fallen below ten percent a year.
Food</p>
<p>prices have been rising at a rate of 30 percent a year. At the same
time,</p>
<p>food production–other than rice production-has remained stagnant,</p>
<p>and in some cases has actually gone down.</p>
<p>The high cost of animal proteins has acted like a suction pump on</p>
<p>he cost of all other food products. 1977 was a year of bumper
harvests</p>
<p>of such things as Japanese oranges and vegetables-with crops so
large</p>
<p>as to be almost unsalable. Yet the costs of these products have
kept</p>
<p>going up. There is now virtually no dish-even soba (buckwheat</p>
<p>noodles), which used to be what peanut butter sandwiches are to
the</p>
<p>American diet-that can be bought for less than .50 a portion.</p>
<p>Food and education are basic economic costs. They are the costs
of</p>
<p>forming the human resource. Both, in Japan, are out of control. And
as</p>
<p>hey keep rising, the real income of the Japanese family is going
down.</p>
<p>Even well-to-do people, during my last trip to Japan, had begun
to</p>
<p>ration food. Even well-to-do people are hard pressed to find the</p>
<p>increasing sums to finance their children’s access to education.
That</p>
<p>he basic costs of the Japanese economy are going up so fast will</p>
<p>endanger the long-range cohesion of Japanese society. It is the
greatest</p>
<p>hreat, both to Japan’s economic position in a competitive world and
to</p>
<p>her social order.</p>
<p>Some of the policies that Japan will have to develop–including</p>
<p>some that only a few years ago were unthinkable-are emerging with</p>
<p>reasonable clarity, and are beginning to be discussed in Japan.
The</p>
<p>government is beginning to press for delayed retirement-at age
sixty</p>
<p>instead of fifty-five. There is talk of retraining redundant workers
and</p>
<p>of placing them in new employments where there is demand for
labor,</p>
<p>for example, shipyard workers in automobile plants. There are the</p>
<p>beginnings of mobility for highly qualified young professionals.
And</p>
<p>here is some slight movement toward tempering the seniority-wage</p>
<p>system with wage measures based on productivity.</p>
<p>But the policies that are most needed-and needed most urgently-</p>
<p>are still beyond Japanese political will and social imagination. What
is</p>
<p>Japan: The Problems of Success 395</p>
<p>needed most is a sharp cut in prices for the domestic consumer.
Japan</p>
<p>suffers from excess inventory, both of raw materials and of
finished</p>
<p>goods. Her policy, these last few years, has been to maintain
domestic</p>
<p>prices-if only to protect the domestic distribution system-by
con-</p>
<p>ducting a gigantic clearance sale abroad. That policy has to come to
an</p>
<p>end-it can only destroy Japan’s capacity to export altogether. Now
is</p>
<p>he time to bring prices down in the domestic market, both to
answer</p>
<p>he charge of “dumping“ and to boost the domestic economy.</p>
<p>There is need for a shift in agricultural policy from one that
encour-</p>
<p>ages the production of unsalable high-cost rice to one that, like
the</p>
<p>British farm policy, maintains farm incomes while giving the
consum-</p>
<p>er low food prices. Especially there is need for a shift to a
farm</p>
<p>program that encourages farmers to take poor rice land out of
rice</p>
<p>production and to shift it into producing feed crops, oil-bearing
crops,</p>
<p>and animal proteins. Japan could probably supply far more–one</p>
<p>estimate is at least two-fifths-f her growing demand for animal
and</p>
<p>vegetable protein, other than fish (which is likely to keep on
declin-</p>
<p>ing), by domestic production on land that today produces rice at
high</p>
<p>cost.</p>
<p>There is need to encourage “production-sharing“-that is, the off-</p>
<p>shore performance of labor-intensive work, with the product sold
on</p>
<p>he Japanese market, in exchange against export of knowledge and</p>
<p>echnology.</p>
<p>Seventy years ago, the general manager of the Mitsui Group, then
as</p>
<p>now one of Japan’s leading industrial concerns, worked out the
solu-</p>
<p>ion to the seniority-wage conundrum. When some of the Mitsui</p>
<p>companies had to lay off employees in the recession that followed
the</p>
<p>Russo-Japanese War, he organized their systematic placement with</p>
<p>other Mitsui companies, in which the new employer would pay the</p>
<p>wage befitting the employee’s seniority, that is, the entrance
wage,</p>
<p>while the Mitsui Group itself would make up the difference
between</p>
<p>hat wage and the wage befitting the employee’s age. The sum that
the</p>
<p>Mitsui Group had to pay was ludicrously small, yet Mitsui could</p>
<p>maintain employment security without employment rigidity. Some</p>
<p>such policy will be needed on a national scale in Japan, together
with a</p>
<p>policy of systematically retraining and replacing employees of
indus-</p>
<p>ries that cannot be maintained under Japanese labor costs,
population</p>
<p>structures and education structures.</p>
<p>What needs to be done is not so very difficult to discern, albeit</p>
<p>difficult to do. The one area, however, in which no one in Japan
can</p>
<p>see a solution is that of education. At most, there is talk-and only
talk</p>
<p>so f a r - o f loosening the linkage between the “right“ university
and</p>
<p>he “prestige employments,“ under which careers in major compa-</p>
<p>nies, major universities, and practically all government agencies
are</p>
<p>reserved to the graduates of a few schools. But the “tracking“ of</p>
<p>people that reserves career opportunities to the graduate from
the</p>
<p>“prestige“ university and that, in turn, creates what are
increasingly</p>
<p>unbearable emotional pressures and financial costs, is still
beyond</p>
<p>challenge, with no substitute for it in sight or even imaginable.</p>
<p>For the first time in twenty years, I left Japan not wholly
confident</p>
<p>about the country’s future. So far, it seemed to me, few people
in</p>
<p>Japan have faced up to the fundamental issues. But Japan has
shown</p>
<p>unparalleled capacity throughout her history for the 180-degree
turn</p>
<p>and for forging, almost overnight, a national consensus to impose
on</p>
<p>herself radical change. Japan has also shown unparalleled
capacity,</p>
<p>hroughout her history, for social innovation. This capacity,
going</p>
<p>back almost 1,500 years, may indeed be Japan’s greatest strength.</p>
<p>Japan may well suddenly face up to her problems of success and to
the</p>
<p>need to maintain the essence of Japan in new forms and through
new</p>
<p>policies. But also, Japan faces a turbulent, a difficult and a
dangerous</p>
<p>period-a period in which there will be surprises for Japan, as well
as</p>
<p>for the Western world, with which Japan is now so strongly
linked,</p>
<p>and on which she is so heavily dependent. The economic problems
and</p>
<p>needs-the resistance to Japan’s trade offensive, the currency
chaos,</p>
<p>he petroleum cartel-may be the catalysts. But the real decisions
will</p>
<p>have to be on social structure, social policies and social
values.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The best available Japanese study concludes that university
graduates make up 58</li>
</ol>
<p>percent of the males now entering the labor force in Japan. This is
the highest</p>
<p>percentage in the world. The comparable U. S. figure is 48
percent.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>So far as I can tell, there are as yet few signs of the kinds of
explosion of</li>
</ol>
<p>resentment and rejection that I am suggesting is possible. During
this visit to Japan,</p>
<p>I heard for the first time of apparently qualified students dropping
out of the</p>
<p>university-but these appeared to be only among members of families
with such</p>
<p>strong connections that the children would still have substantial
advantages. My</p>
<p>hunch is that the system may not show many signs of erosion up to a
certain point,</p>
<p>but that it may then change very rapidly once, so to speak, it boils
over.</p>
