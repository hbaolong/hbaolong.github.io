<h4 id="work-and-tools">Work and Tools</h4>
<p>Man, alone of all animals, is capable of purposeful nonorganic</p>
<p>evolution; he makes tools. This observation by Alfred Russell
Wal-</p>
<p>lace, co-discoverer with Darwin of the theory of evolution, may
seem</p>
<p>obvious if not trite. But it is a profound insight. And though
made</p>
<p>some seventy or eighty years ago, its implications have yet to be</p>
<p>hought through by biologists and technologists.</p>
<p>One such implication is that from a biologist’s (or a
historian’s)</p>
<p>point of view, the technologist’s identification of tool with
material</p>
<p>artifact is quite arbitrary. Language, too, is a tool, and so are
all</p>
<p>abstract concepts. This does not mean that the technologist’s
definition</p>
<p>should be discarded. All human disciplines rest after all on
similarly</p>
<p>arbitrary distinctions. But it does mean that technologists ought to
be</p>
<p>conscious of the artificiality of their definition and careful lest
it</p>
<p>become a barrier rather than a help to knowledge and
understanding.</p>
<p>This is particularly relevant for the history of technology, I
believe.</p>
<p>According to the technologist’s definition of “tool,“ the abacus
and</p>
<p>he geometer’s compass are normally considered technology, but the</p>
<p>multiplication table or table of logarithms is not. Yet this
arbitrary</p>
<p>division makes all but impossible the understanding of so important
a</p>
<p>subject as the development of the technology of mathematics. Sim-</p>
<p>ilarly the technologist’s elimination of the fine arts from his field
of</p>
<p>vision blinds the historian of technology to an understanding of
the</p>
<p>relationship between scientific knowledge and technology. (See,
for</p>
<p>First published in Technology and Culture, 1959.</p>
<p>instance, volumes I11 and IV of Singer’s monumental History of</p>
<p>Technology.) For scientific thought and knowledge were married to
the</p>
<p>fine arts, at least in the West, long before they even got on
speaking</p>
<p>erms with the mechanical crafts: in the mathematical number
theories</p>
<p>of the designers of the Gothic cathedral,’ in the geometric optics
of</p>
<p>Renaissance painting, or in the acoustics of the great Baroque
organs.</p>
<p>And Lynn T. White, Jr. has shown in several recent articles that
to</p>
<p>understand the history and development of the mechanical devices
of</p>
<p>he Middle Ages we must understand something so nonmechanical and</p>
<p>nonmaterial as the new concept of the dignity and sanctity of
labor</p>
<p>which St. Benedict first introduced.</p>
<p>Even within the technologist’s definition of technology as
dealing</p>
<p>with mechanical artifacts alone, Wallace’s insight has major
rele-</p>
<p>vance. The subject matter of technology, according to the preface
to</p>
<p>History of Technology, is “how things are done or made“; and most</p>
<p>students of technology, to my knowledge, agree with this. But the</p>
<p>Wallace insight leads to a different definition: the subject matter
of</p>
<p>echnology would be “how man does or makes.“ As to the meaning</p>
<p>and end of technology, the same source, again presenting the
general</p>
<p>view, defines them as “mastery of his [man’s] natural
environment.“</p>
<p>Oh no, the Wallace insight would say (and in rather shocked
tones):</p>
<p>he purpose is to overcome man’s own natural, that is, animal,
limita-</p>
<p>ions. Technology enables man, a land-bound biped, without gills,</p>
<p>fins, or wings, to be at home in the water or in the air. It enables
an</p>
<p>animal with very poor body insulation, that is, a subtropical animal,
to</p>
<p>live in all climate zones. It enables one of the weakest and slowest
of</p>
<p>he primates to add to his own strength that of elephant or ox, and
to</p>
<p>his own speed that of the horse. It enables him to push his life
span</p>
<p>from his “natural“ twenty years or so to threescore years and ten;
it</p>
<p>even enables him to forget that natural death is death from
predators,</p>
<p>disease, starvation, or accident, and to call death from natural
causes</p>
<p>hat which has never been observed in wild animals: death from</p>
<p>organic decay in old age.2</p>
<p>These developments of man have, of course, had impact on his</p>
<p>natural environment-though I suspect that until recent days the
im-</p>
<p>pact has been very slight indeed. But this impact on nature outside
of</p>
<p>man is incidental. What really matters is that all these
developments</p>
<p>alter man’s biological capacity-and not through the random
genetic</p>
<p>Work and Tools 279</p>
<p>mutation of biological evolution but through the purposeful
nonorganic</p>
<p>development we call technology.</p>
<p>What I have called here the “Wallace insight,“ that is, the
approach</p>
<p>from human biology, thus leads to the conclusion that technology
is</p>
<p>not about things: tools, processes, and products. It is about work:
the</p>
<p>specifically human activity by means of which man pushes back the</p>
<p>limitations of the iron biological law which condemns all other
animals</p>
<p>o devote all their time and energy to keeping themselves alive for
the</p>
<p>next day, if not for the next hour. The same conclusion would be</p>
<p>reached, by the way, from any approach, for instance, from that of
the</p>
<p>anthropologist’s “culture,“ that does not mistake technology for
a</p>
<p>phenomenon of the physical universe. We might define technology
as</p>
<p>human action on physical objects or as a set of physical objects
charac-</p>
<p>erized by serving human purposes. Either way the realm and
subject</p>
<p>matter of the study of technology would be human work.</p>
<p>For the historian of technology this line of thought might be more
than</p>
<p>a quibble over definitions. For it leads to the conclusion that the
study</p>
<p>of the development and history of technology, even in its very
nar-</p>
<p>rowest definition as the study of one particular mechanical
artifact</p>
<p>(either tool or product) or a particular process, would be
productive</p>
<p>only within an understanding of work and in the context of the
history</p>
<p>and development of work.</p>
<p>Not only must the available tools and techniques strongly
influence</p>
<p>what work can and will be done, but how it will be done. Work,
its</p>
<p>structure, organization, and concepts must in turn powerfully
affect</p>
<p>ools and techniques and their development. The influence, one
would</p>
<p>deduce, should be so great as to make it difficult to understand
the</p>
<p>development of the tool or of the technique unless its relationship
to</p>
<p>work was known and understood. Whatever evidence we have strongly</p>
<p>supports this deduction.</p>
<p>Systematic attempts to study and to improve work only began some</p>
<p>seventy-five years ago with Frederick W. Taylor. Until then work
had</p>
<p>always been taken for granted by everyone-as it is still,
apparently,</p>
<p>aken for granted by most students of technology. “Scientific
Manage-</p>
<p>ment, “ as Taylor’s efforts were called misleadingly (’ ’scientific
work</p>
<p>study“ would have been a better term and would have avoided a
great</p>
<p>deal of confusion), was not concerned with technology. Indeed, it
took</p>
<p>ools and techniques largely as given and tried to enable the
individual</p>
<p>worker to manipulate them more economically, more systematically,</p>
<p>and more effectively. And yet this approach resulted almost imme-</p>
<p>diately in major changes and development in tools, processes, and</p>
<p>products. The assembly line with its conveyors was an important
tool</p>
<p>change. An even greater change was the change in process that
under-</p>
<p>lay the switch from building to assembling a product. Today we
are</p>
<p>beginning to see yet another powerful consequence of Taylor’s
work</p>
<p>on individual operations: the change from organizing production</p>
<p>around the doing of things to things to organizing production
around</p>
<p>he flow of things and information, the change we call
“automation“.</p>
<p>A similar, direct impact on tools and techniques is likely to
result</p>
<p>from another and even more recent approach to the study and
improve-</p>
<p>ment of work: the approach called variously “human engineering,“</p>
<p>“industrial psychology“, or “industrial physiology“. Scientific
Man-</p>
<p>agement and its descendants study work as operation; human
engineer-</p>
<p>ing and its allied disciplines are concerned with the relationship
be-</p>
<p>ween technology and human anatomy, human perception, human</p>
<p>nervous system, and human emotion. Fatigue studies were the
earliest</p>
<p>and most widely known examples; studies of sensory perception and</p>
<p>reaction, for instance, of aircraft pilots, are among the presently
most</p>
<p>active areas of investigation, as are studies of learning. We have
barely</p>
<p>scratched the surface here; yet we know already that these studies
are</p>
<p>leading us to major changes in the theory and design of instruments
of</p>
<p>measurement and control, and into the redesign of traditional
skills,</p>
<p>raditional tools, and traditional processes.</p>
<p>But of course we worked on work, if only through trial and error,</p>
<p>long before we systematized the job. The best example of
Scientific</p>
<p>Management is after all not to be found in our century: it is the</p>
<p>alphabet. The assembly line as a concept of work was understood
by</p>
<p>hose unknown geniuses who, at the very beginning of historical
time,</p>
<p>replaced the aristocratic artist of warfare (portrayed in his last
moments</p>
<p>of glory by Homer) by the army soldier with his uniform
equipment,</p>
<p>his few repetitive operations, and his regimented drill. The best
exam-</p>
<p>ple of human engineering is still the long handle that changed
the</p>
<p>sickle into the scythe, thus belatedly adjusting reaping to the
evolution-</p>
<p>ary change that had much earlier changed man from crouching
quadru-</p>
<p>ped into upright biped. Every one of these developments in work
had</p>
<p>Work and Tools 281</p>
<p>immediate and powerful impact on tools, process, and product, that
is,</p>
<p>on the artifacts of technology.</p>
<p>The aspect of work that has probably had the greatest impact on</p>
<p>echnology is the one we know the least about: the organization of</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>Work, as far as we have any record of man, has always been both</p>
<p>individual and social. The most thoroughly collectivist society
history</p>
<p>knows, that of Inca Peru, did not succeed in completely
collectivizing</p>
<p>work; technology-in particular, the making of tools, pottery,
textiles,</p>
<p>and cult objects-remained the work of individuals. It was
personally</p>
<p>specialized rather than biologically or socially specialized, as is
work</p>
<p>in a beehive or in an ant heap. The most thoroughgoing
individualist</p>
<p>society, the perfect market model of classical economics,
presupposed</p>
<p>a tremendous amount of collective organization in respect to law,</p>
<p>money and credit, transportation, and so on. But precisely
because</p>
<p>individual effort and collective effort must always be calibrated
with</p>
<p>one another, the organization of work is not determined. To a
very</p>
<p>considerable extent there are genuine alternatives here, genuine</p>
<p>choices. The organization of work, in other words, is in itself one
of</p>
<p>he major means of that purposeful and non-organic evolution which
is</p>
<p>specifically human; it is in itself an important tool of man.</p>
<p>Only within the very last decades have we begun to look at the</p>
<p>organization of work.“ut we have already learned that the task,
the</p>
<p>ools, and the social organization of work are not totally
independent</p>
<p>but mutually influence and affect one another. We know, for
instance,</p>
<p>hat the almost preindustrial technology of the New York women’s</p>
<p>dress industry is the result not of technological, economic, or
market</p>
<p>conditions but of the social organization of work which is
traditional in</p>
<p>hat industry. The opposite has been proven, too: when we
introduce</p>
<p>certain tools into locomotive shops, for instance, the traditional
organi-</p>
<p>zation of work, the organization of the crafts, becomes untenable;
and</p>
<p>he very skills that made men productive under the old technology
now</p>
<p>become a major obstacle to their being able to produce at all. A
good</p>
<p>case can be made for the hypothesis that modem farm implements
have</p>
<p>made the Russian collective farm socially obsolete as an
organization</p>
<p>of work, have made it yesterday’s socialist solution of farm
organiza-</p>
<p>ion rather than today’s, let alone tomorrow’s.</p>
<p>This interrelationship between organization of work, tasks, and</p>
<p>ools must always have existed. One might even speculate that the</p>
<p>explanation for the mysterious time gap between the early
introduction</p>
<p>of the potter’s wheel and the so very late introduction of the
spinning</p>
<p>wheel lies in the social organization of spinning work as a group
task</p>
<p>performed, as the Homeric epics describe it, by the mistress
working</p>
<p>with her daughters and maids. The spinning wheel with its demand
for</p>
<p>individual concentration on the machinery and its speed is hardly</p>
<p>conducive to free social intercourse; even on a narrowly economic</p>
<p>basis, the governmental, disciplinary, and educational yields of
the</p>
<p>spinning bee may well have appeared more valuable than faster and</p>
<p>cleaner yam.</p>
<p>If we know far too little about work and its organization scien-</p>
<p>ifically, we know nothing about it historically. It is not lack of
records</p>
<p>hat explains this, at least not for historic times. Great
writers-</p>
<p>Hesiod, Aristophanes, Virgil, for instance-have left detailed
descrip-</p>
<p>ions. For the early empires and then again for the last seven
centuries,</p>
<p>beginning with the High Middle Ages, we have an abundance of</p>
<p>pictorial material: pottery and relief paintings, woodcuts,
etchings,</p>
<p>prints. What is lacking is attention and objective study.</p>
<p>The political’ historian or the art historian, still dominated by
the</p>
<p>prejudices of Hellenism, usually dismisses work as beneath his
notice;</p>
<p>he historian of technology is “thing-focused.“ As a result, we
not</p>
<p>only still repeat as fact traditions regarding the organization of
work in</p>
<p>he past which both our available sources and our knowledge of the</p>
<p>organization of work would stamp as old wives’ tales. We also
deny</p>
<p>ourselves a fuller understanding of the already existing and
already</p>
<p>collected information regarding the history and use of tools.</p>
<p>One example of this is the lack of attention given to materials-</p>
<p>moving and materials-handling equipment. We know that moving</p>
<p>hings-rather than fabricating things-is the central effort in
produc-</p>
<p>ion. But we have paid little attention to the development of
materials-</p>
<p>moving and materials-handling equipment.</p>
<p>The Gothic cathedral is another example. H. G. Thomson in History</p>
<p>of Technology (11, 384) states flatly, for instance, “there was no
exact</p>
<p>medieval equivalent of the specialized architect“ in the Middle
Ages;</p>
<p>here was only “a master mason“. But we have overwhelming evi-</p>
<p>dence to the contrary (summarized, for instance, in Simson4); the</p>
<p>Work and Tools 283</p>
<p>specialized, scientifically trained architect actually dominated. He
was</p>
<p>sharply distinguished from the master by training and social
position.</p>
<p>Far from being anonymous, as we still commonly assert, he was a</p>
<p>famous man, sometimes with an international practice ranging from</p>
<p>Scotland to Poland to Sicily. Indeed, he took great pains to make
sure</p>
<p>hat he would be known and remembered, not only in written records</p>
<p>but above all by having himself portrayed in the churches he
designed</p>
<p>in his full regalia as a scientific geometer and
designer-something</p>
<p>even the best known of today’s architects would hesitate to do.
Sim-</p>
<p>ilarly we still repeat early German Romanticism in the belief that
the</p>
<p>Gothic cathedral was the work of individual craftsmen. But the
struc-</p>
<p>ural fabric of the cathedral was based on strict uniformity of parts.
The</p>
<p>men worked to moulds which were collectively held and
administered</p>
<p>as the property of the guild. Only roofing, ornaments, doors,
statuary,</p>
<p>windows, and so on, were individual artists’ work. Considering
both</p>
<p>he extreme scarcity of skilled people and the heavy dependence on</p>
<p>local, unskilled labor from the countryside to which all our
sources</p>
<p>attest, there must also have been a sharp division between the
skilled</p>
<p>men who made parts and the unskilled who assembled them under the</p>
<p>direction of a foreman or a gang boss. There must thus have been
a</p>
<p>fairly advanced materials-handling technology which is, indeed,
de-</p>
<p>picted in our sources but neglected by the historians of technology
with</p>
<p>heir uncritical Romanticist bias. And while the moulds to which
the</p>
<p>craftsman worked are generally mentioned, no one, to my
knowledge,</p>
<p>has yet investigated so remarkable a tool, and one that so
completely</p>
<p>contradicts all we otherwise believe we know about medieval work
and</p>
<p>echnology.</p>
<p>I do not mean to suggest that we drop the historical study of
tools,</p>
<p>processes, and products. We quite obviously need to know much</p>
<p>more. I am saying that the history of work is in itself a big,
rewarding,</p>
<p>and challenging area which students of technology should be
partic-</p>
<p>ularly well equipped to tackle. I am saying also that we need work
on</p>
<p>work if the history of technology is truly to be history and not just
the</p>
<p>engineer’s antiquarianism.</p>
<p>One final question must be asked: without study and understanding
of</p>
<p>work, how can we hope to arrive at an understanding of
technology?</p>
<p>Singer’s great History of Technology abandons the attempt to give
a</p>
<p>comprehensive treatment of its subject with 1850; at that time,
the</p>
<p>editors tell us, technology became so complex as to defy
description,</p>
<p>let alone understanding. But it is precisely then that technology
began</p>
<p>o be a central force and to have major impact both on man’s
culture</p>
<p>and on man’s natural environment. To say that we cannot encompass</p>
<p>modern technology is very much like saying that medicine stops
when</p>
<p>he embryo issues from the womb. We need a theory that enables us
to</p>
<p>organize the variety and complexity of modem tools around some</p>
<p>basic, unifying concept.</p>
<p>To a layman who is neither professional historian nor
professional</p>
<p>echnologist, it would, moreover, appear that even the old
technology,</p>
<p>he technology before the great explosion of the last hundred
years,</p>
<p>makes no real sense and cannot be understood, can hardly even be</p>
<p>described, without such basic concepts. Every writer on
technology</p>
<p>acknowledges the extraordinary number, variety, and complexity of</p>
<p>factors that play a part in technology and are in turn influenced by
it:</p>
<p>economy and legal system, political institutions and social
values,</p>
<p>philosophical abstractions, religious beliefs, and scientific
knowledge.</p>
<p>No one can know all these, let alone handle them all in their
constantly</p>
<p>shifting relationship. Yet all of them are part of technology in one
way</p>
<p>or another, at one time or another.</p>
<p>The typical reaction to such a situation has of course always been
to</p>
<p>proclaim one of these factors as the determinant-the economy, for</p>
<p>instance, or the religious beliefs. We know that this can only lead
to</p>
<p>complete failure to understand. These factors profoundly influence
but</p>
<p>do not determine each other; at most they may set limits to each
other</p>
<p>or create a range of opportunities for each other. Nor can we
under-</p>
<p>stand technology in terms of the anthropologist’s concept of culture
as</p>
<p>a stable, complete, and finite balance of these factors. Such a
culture</p>
<p>may exist among small, primitive, decaying tribes, living in
isolation.</p>
<p>But this is precisely the reason why they are small, primitive,
and</p>
<p>decaying. Any viable culture is characterized by capacity for
internal</p>
<p>self-generated change in the energy-level and direction of any one
of</p>
<p>hese factors and in their interrelationships.</p>
<p>Technology, in other words, must be considered as a ~ y s t e m
that</p>
<p>,~</p>
<p>is, a collection of interrelated and intercommunicating units and
activ-</p>
<p>ities.</p>
<p>We know that we can study and understand such a system only if we</p>
<p>have a unifying focus where the interaction of all the forces and
factors</p>
<p>Work and Tools 285</p>
<p>within the system registers some discernible effect, and where in
turn</p>
<p>he complexities of the system can be resolved in one theoretical</p>
<p>model. Tools, processes, and products are clearly incapable of
provid-</p>
<p>ing such focus for the understanding of the complex system we
call</p>
<p>echnology. It is just possible, however, that work might provide
the</p>
<p>focus, might provide the integration of all these interdependent,
yet</p>
<p>autonomous variables, might provide one unifying concept which
will</p>
<p>enable us to understand technology both in itself and in its role,
its</p>
<p>impact on and relationships with values and institutions,
knowledge</p>
<p>and beliefs, individual and society.</p>
<p>Such understanding would be of vital importance today. The great,</p>
<p>perhaps the central, event of our times is the disappearance of all
non-</p>
<p>Western societies and cultures under the inundation of Western
tech-</p>
<p>nology. Yet we have no way of analysing this process, of
predicting</p>
<p>what it will do to man, his institutions and values, let alone of</p>
<p>controlling it, that is, of specifying with any degree of assurance
what</p>
<p>needs to be done to make this momentous change productive or at
least</p>
<p>bearable. We desperately need a real understanding, and a real
theory,</p>
<p>a real model of technology.</p>
<p>History has never been satisfied to be a mere inventory of what
is</p>
<p>dead and gone-that, indeed, is antiquarianism. True history
always</p>
<p>aims at helping us understand ourselves, at helping us make what
shall</p>
<p>be. Just as we look to the historian of government for a better
under-</p>
<p>standing of government, and to the historian of art for a better
under-</p>
<p>standing of art, so we are entitled to look to the historian of
technology</p>
<p>for a better understanding of technology. But how can he give us
such</p>
<p>an understanding unless he himself has some concept of technology</p>
<p>and not merely a collection of individual tools and artifacts? And
can</p>
<p>he develop such a concept unless work rather than things becomes
the</p>
<p>focus of his study of technology and of its history?</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>S. B. Hamilton only expresses the prevailing view of technologists
when he says</li>
</ol>
<p>(in Singer’s History of Technology, IV, 469) in respect to the
architects of the</p>
<p>Gothic cathedral and their patrons that there is “nothing to suggest
that either party</p>
<p>was driven or pursued by any theory as to what would be beautiful“.
Yet we have</p>
<p>overwhelming and easily accessible evidence to the contrary; both
architect and</p>
<p>patron were not just “driven“, they were actually obsessed by
rigorously mathe-</p>
<p>matical theories of structure and beauty. See, for instance,
Sedlmayr, Die Entste-</p>
<p>hung der Kathedrale (Ziirich, 1950); von Simson, The Gothic Cathedral
(London:</p>
<p>Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1956); and especially the direct testimony
of one of the</p>
<p>greatest of the cathedral designers, Abbot Suger of St-Denis, in
Abbot Suger on the</p>
<p>Abbey Church of St-Denis and its Art Treasures, ed. Erwin Panofsky
(Princeton,</p>
<p>1946).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>See on this Sir P. B. Medawar, the British biologist, in “Old Age
and Natural</li>
</ol>
<p>Death“ in his The Uniqueness of the Individual (London: Methuen,
1957).</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Among the studies ought to be mentioned the work of the late Elton
Mayo, first in</li>
</ol>
<p>Australia and then at Harvard, especially his two slim books: The
Human Problems</p>
<p>of an Industrial Civilization (2nd edn, Boston, 1946) and The Social
Problems of</p>
<p>an Industrial Civilization (Boston, 1945); the studies of the French
sociologist</p>
<p>Georges Friedmann, especially his Industrial Society (Glencoe: Free
Press, 1964);</p>
<p>he work carried on at Yale by Charles R. Walker and his group,
especially the</p>
<p>book by him and Robert H. Guest: The Man on the Assembly Line
(Cambridge,</p>
<p>Mass: Hanard University Press, 1952). I understand that studies of
the organiza-</p>
<p>ion of work are also being carried out at the Polish Academy of
Science, but I have</p>
<p>not been able to obtain any of the results.</p>
