<h4 id="introduction-to-part-four">Introduction to Part Four</h4>
<p>There has been a veritable explosion of books on business ethics,</p>
<p>sermons on business ethics, college courses on business ethics.
And</p>
<p>here can be little doubt that ethics are badly needed in
business-</p>
<p>hough no more so than in governments, in police departments, in</p>
<p>universities, and in all other places where there is money, power,
or</p>
<p>sex. But is there such a thing as “Business Ethics?“ Can there be
such</p>
<p>a thing? This essay-it reflects the fact that I once taught
philosophy</p>
<p>and ethics-was highly unpopular when it was published in 1981 and</p>
<p>is just as unpopular today, for it answers the question with a
flat</p>
<p>“No.“ There either is-the answer given by Western philosophy-</p>
<p>only one ethic, and it is that of the individual; everything else
is</p>
<p>casuistry and must, as all history proves, rapidly degenerate
into</p>
<p>finding excuses for even the most unethical and immoral behavior
of</p>
<p>he powerful. Or-the answer which Eastern and especially Confucian</p>
<p>philosophy would give-there can be only the same ethics for every</p>
<p>kind of organization, that is for any human group in which people</p>
<p>work or live together in a variety of relationships.</p>
<p>This essay, in other words, does not deal with business as “busi-</p>
<p>ness.“ It deals with business as one of society’s institutions. And
so do</p>
<p>he other essays in this part. Indeed this has been my approach to</p>
<p>business altogether. I am widely known as a “business writer,“ but,
in</p>
<p>ruth, I never had great interest in business. Having worked with</p>
<p>businesses for almost fifty years now I have come to know a good
deal</p>
<p>about them. But I know just as much about universities,
hospitals,</p>
<p>churches, government agencies-and for the same reason: I have</p>
<p>worked with them for many years. And only one of my twenty-five</p>
<p>books is a “business book“: Managing for Results, 1964-the first</p>
<p>book written on what we now call “strategy.“ It deals exclusively</p>
<p>with obtaining economic results in a business. That I began to
study</p>
<p>organization and management by studying the management of
business</p>
<p>enterprise-in the early 1940s-was simply because no other
institu-</p>
<p>ion then was either as visible or as accessible. No other
institution</p>
<p>would even now invite an outsider to make a close study of its</p>
<p>structure, its policies, its values and beliefs. Even as old and
well-</p>
<p>known an institution as the Catholic Church has only lately
permitted</p>
<p>an outsider to look at its central institution, the archdiocese, from
the</p>
<p>inside-and then the student was a priest; I doubt that a layman
would</p>
<p>have been admitted. But in 1943 a business, General Motors,
invited</p>
<p>me in; and thus the study of management began as a study of
business</p>
<p>management, for my 1946 book, Concept of the Corporation (to be
re-</p>
<p>issued soon as a Transaction book), was the first one to study
the</p>
<p>management of an organization, and the only one for a long time.</p>
<p>Still, business is a separate institution. It has its own purpose
and</p>
<p>mission and they are different from the purpose and mission of a</p>
<p>hospital or university or church or the Red Cross. It has its own
values</p>
<p>and its own definition of “results.“ It is, like all our modern
institu-</p>
<p>ions, a special-purpose, indeed a single-purpose institution. It
exists,</p>
<p>however, to perform a social function: the provision of goods and</p>
<p>services which we call the “economic“ function. And as such it
has</p>
<p>specific social opportunities, specific social challenges. One such
is</p>
<p>he challenge of enabling individuals to achieve-the challenge of</p>
<p>making people productive in work. Another one is the challenge of</p>
<p>organizing the productive process so as to obtain maximum yield
from</p>
<p>society’s scarce resources. These social challenges are being
discussed</p>
<p>in the second and third essay of this part.</p>
