<h4 id="management-the-problems-of-success">Management: The Problems of
Success</h4>
<p>The best-kept secret in management is that the first systematic</p>
<p>applications of management theory and management principles did
not</p>
<p>ake place in business enterprise. They occurred in the public
sector.</p>
<p>The first systematic and deliberate application of management
princi-</p>
<p>ples in the United States-undertaken with full consciousness of
its</p>
<p>being an application of management-was the reorganization of the</p>
<p>U.S. Army by Elihu Root, Teddy Roosevelt’s secretary of war. Only
a</p>
<p>few years later, in 1908, came the first “city manager“ (in
Staunton,</p>
<p>Virginia), the result of a conscious application of such
then-brand-new</p>
<p>management principles as the separation of “policy“ (lodged in an</p>
<p>elected and politically accountable city council) from
“management“</p>
<p>(lodged in a nonpolitical professional, accountable managerially).
The</p>
<p>city manager, by the way, was the first senior executive anyplace</p>
<p>called a manager; in business, this title was still quite
unknown.</p>
<p>Frederick W. Taylor, for instance, in his famous 1911 testimony</p>
<p>before the U.S. Congress never used the term but spoke of “the</p>
<p>owners and their helpers.“ And when Taylor was asked to name an</p>
<p>organization that truly practiced “Scientific Management, “ he did
not</p>
<p>name a business but the Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>Thirty years after, the city manager, Luther Gulick applied
manage-</p>
<p>ment and management principles to the organization of a federal</p>
<p>government that had grown out of control in the New Deal years.
It</p>
<p>First delivered as a keynote address at the Academy of Management
Congress in</p>
<p>Chicago in 1986.</p>
<p>was not until 1950 and 1951, that is, more than ten years later,
that</p>
<p>similar management concepts and principles were systematically
ap-</p>
<p>plied in a business enterprise to a similar task: the reorganization
of the</p>
<p>General Electric Company after it had outgrown its earlier,
purely</p>
<p>functional organization structure.</p>
<p>Today, surely, there is as much management outside of business as</p>
<p>here is in business-maybe more. The most management-conscious</p>
<p>of our present institutions are probably the military, followed
closely</p>
<p>by hospitals. Forty years ago the then-new management consultants</p>
<p>considered only business enterprises as potential clients. Today half
of</p>
<p>he clients of a typical management consulting firm are
nonbusiness:</p>
<p>government agencies, the military, schools and universities,
hospitals,</p>
<p>museums, professional associations, and community agencies like
the</p>
<p>Boy Scouts and the Red Cross.</p>
<p>And increasingly, holders of the advanced degree in business ad-</p>
<p>ministration, the MBA, are the preferred recruits for careers in
city</p>
<p>management, in art museums, and in the federal government’s
Office</p>
<p>of Management and Budget.</p>
<p>Yet most people still hear the words business management when</p>
<p>hey hear or read management. Management books often outsell all</p>
<p>other nonfiction books on the bestseller lists; yet they are
normally</p>
<p>reviewed on the business page. One “graduate business school“
after</p>
<p>another renames itself “School of Management.“ But the degree it</p>
<p>awards has remained the MBA, the Master of Business Administra-</p>
<p>ion. Management books, whether textbooks for use in college
classes</p>
<p>or books for the general reader, deal mainly with business and
use</p>
<p>business examples or business cases.</p>
<p>That we hear and read business management when the word man-</p>
<p>agement is spoken or printed has a simple explanation. The
business</p>
<p>enterprise was not the first of the managed institutions. The
modem</p>
<p>university and the modem army each antedate the modem business</p>
<p>enterprise by a half century. They emerged during and shortly after
the</p>
<p>Napoleonic Wars. Indeed, the first “CEO“ of a modem institution</p>
<p>was the chief of staff of the post-Napoleonic Prussian army, an
office</p>
<p>developed between 1820 and 1840. In spirit as well as in
structure,</p>
<p>both the new university and the new army represented a sharp
break</p>
<p>with their predecessors. But both concealed this-deliberately-by</p>
<p>Management: The Problems of Success 155</p>
<p>using the old titles, many of the old rites and ceremonies and,
espe-</p>
<p>cially, by maintaining the social position of the institution and of
its</p>
<p>leaders.</p>
<p>No one could, however, have mistaken the new business enterprise,</p>
<p>as it arose in the third quarter of the nineteenth century, for a
direct</p>
<p>continuation of the old and traditional “business firm’’-the
“count-</p>
<p>ing house“ consisting of two elderly brothers and one clerk that
figures</p>
<p>so prominently in Charles Dickens’s popular books published in
the</p>
<p>1850s and 1860s, and in so many other nineteenth-century novels,</p>
<p>down to Thomas Mann’s Buddenbrooks published in 1906.</p>
<p>For one, the new business enterprise-the long-distance railroad
as</p>
<p>it developed in the United States after the Civil War, the
universal</p>
<p>bank as it developed on the European Continent, or the trust such
as</p>
<p>United States Steel, which J. P. Morgan forged in the United States
at</p>
<p>he turn of the twentieth century-were not run by the “owners.“</p>
<p>Indeed, they had no owners, they had “shareholders. “ Legally,
the</p>
<p>new university or the new army was the same institution it had
been</p>
<p>since time immemorial, however much its character and function
had</p>
<p>changed. But to accommodate the new business enterprise, a new
and</p>
<p>different legal persona had to be invented, the “corporation.“ A
much</p>
<p>more accurate term is the French Socie’te’ Anonyme, the anonymous</p>
<p>collective owned by no one and open to investment by everyone. In
the</p>
<p>corporation, shares become a claim to profits rather than to
property.</p>
<p>Share ownership is, of necessity, separate from control and
manage-</p>
<p>ment, and easily divorced from both. And in the new corporation</p>
<p>capital is provided by large, often by very large, numbers of
outsiders,</p>
<p>with each of them holding only a minute fraction and with none of</p>
<p>hem necessarily having an interest in, or-a total novelty-any
lia-</p>
<p>bility for, the conduct of the business.</p>
<p>This new “corporation,“ this new Socie’te’ Anonyme,“ this new</p>
<p>“Aktiengesellschaft,“ could not be explained away as a reform,
which</p>
<p>is how the new army, the new university, and the new hospital</p>
<p>presented themselves. It clearly was a genuine innovation. And
this</p>
<p>innovation soon came to provide the new jobs-at first, for the
rapidly</p>
<p>growing urban proletariat, but increasingly also for educated people.
It</p>
<p>soon came to dominate the economy. What in the older institutions</p>
<p>could be explained as different procedures, different rules, or
different</p>
<p>regulations became in the new institution very soon a new
function,</p>
<p>management, and a new kind of work. And this then invited study;
it</p>
<p>invited attention and controversy.</p>
<p>But even more extraordinary and unprecedented was the position of</p>
<p>his newcomer in society. It was the first new autonomous
institution</p>
<p>in hundreds of years, the first to create a power center that was
within</p>
<p>society yet independent of the central government of the national
state.</p>
<p>This was an offense, a violation of everything the nineteenth
century</p>
<p>(and the twentieth-century political scientists still) considered
“law of</p>
<p>history, “ and frankly a scandal.</p>
<p>Around 1860 one of the leading social scientists of the time, the</p>
<p>Englishman Sir Henry Maine, coined the phrase in his book Ancient</p>
<p>Law that the progress of history is “from status to contract.“
Few</p>
<p>phrases ever have become as popular and as widely accepted as
this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>And yet, at the very time at which Maine proclaimed that the law
of</p>
<p>history demands the elimination of all autonomous power centers</p>
<p>within society, the business enterprise arose. And from the
beginning</p>
<p>it was clearly a power center within society and clearly
autonomous.</p>
<p>To many contemporaries it was, and understandably so, a totally</p>
<p>unnatural development and one that bespoke a monstrous
conspiracy.</p>
<p>The first great social historian America produced, Henry Adams,</p>
<p>clearly saw it this way. His important novel, Democracy, which he</p>
<p>wrote during the Grant administration, portrays the new economic</p>
<p>power as itself corrupt and, in turn, as corrupting the political
process,</p>
<p>government, and society. Henry’s brother, Brooks Adams, a few</p>
<p>decades later, further elaborated on this theme in one of the
most</p>
<p>popular political books ever published in the United States, The
De-</p>
<p>generation of the Democratic Dogma.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Wisconsin economist, John R . Commons-the brain</p>
<p>behind the progressive movement in Wisconsin, the father of most
of</p>
<p>he “reforms“ that later became the social and political innovations
of</p>
<p>he New Deal, and, last but not least, commonly considered the
father</p>
<p>of America’s “business unionismm-took very much the same tack.</p>
<p>He blamed business enterprise on a lawyers’ conspiracy leading to
a</p>
<p>misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution
by</p>
<p>which the corporation was endowed with the same “legal
personality“</p>
<p>as the individual.</p>
<p>Management: The Problems of Success 157</p>
<p>Across the Atlantic in Germany, Walter Rathenau-himself the</p>
<p>successful chief executive of one of the very large new
“corporations“</p>
<p>(and later on to become one of the earliest victims of Nazi terror
when</p>
<p>he was assassinated in 1922 while serving as foreign minister of
the</p>
<p>new Weimar Republic)-similarly felt that the business enterprise
was</p>
<p>something radically new, something quite incompatible with
prevail-</p>
<p>ing political and social theories, and indeed a severe social
problem.</p>
<p>In Japan, Shibusawa Eiichi, who had left a promising government</p>
<p>career in the 1870s to construct a modem Japan through building</p>
<p>businesses, also saw in the business enterprise something quite
new</p>
<p>and distinctly challenging. He tried to tame it by infusing it with
the</p>
<p>Confucian ethic; and Japanese big business as it developed after
World</p>
<p>War I1 is very largely made in Shibusawa’s image.</p>
<p>Everyplace else, the new business enterprise was equally seem as
a</p>
<p>radical and dangerous innovation. In Austria, for instance, Karl</p>
<p>Lueger, the founding father of the “Christian“ parties that still
domi-</p>
<p>nate politics in Continental Europe, was elected lord mayor of
Vienna</p>
<p>in 1897 on a platform that defended the honest and honorable
small</p>
<p>businessman-against the evil and illegitimate corporation. A few</p>
<p>years later, an obscure Italian journalist, Benito Mussolini, rose
to</p>
<p>national prominence by denouncing “the soulless corporation. “</p>
<p>And thus quite naturally, perhaps even inevitably, concern with</p>
<p>management, whether hostile to it or friendly, concentrated on
the</p>
<p>business enterprise. No matter how much management was being</p>
<p>applied to other institutions, it was the business enterprise that
was</p>
<p>visible, prominent, controversial, and above all, new, and
therefore</p>
<p>significant.</p>
<p>By now, however, almost a hundred years after management arose</p>
<p>in the early large business enterprises of the 1870s, it is clear
that</p>
<p>management pertains to every single social institution. In the
last</p>
<p>hundred years every major social function has become lodged in a</p>
<p>large and managed organization. The hospital of 1870 was still
the</p>
<p>place where the poor went to die. By 1950 the hospital had become
one</p>
<p>of the most complex organizations, requiring management of
extraor-</p>
<p>dinary competence. The labor union in developed countries is run</p>
<p>oday by a paid managerial staff, rather than by the politicians who
are</p>
<p>nominally at the head. Even the very large university of 1900 (and
the</p>
<p>largest then had only five thousand students) was still simple, with
a</p>
<p>faculty of, at most, a few hundred, each professor teaching his
own</p>
<p>specialty. It has by now become increasingly complex-including</p>
<p>undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students-with research</p>
<p>institutes and research grants from govemment and industry and,</p>
<p>increasingly, with a large administrative superstructure. And in
the</p>
<p>modem military, the basic question is the extent to which
management</p>
<p>is needed and the extent to which it interferes with
leadershipwith</p>
<p>management apparently winning out.</p>
<p>The identification of management with business can thus no longer</p>
<p>be maintained. Even though our textbooks and our studies still
focus</p>
<p>heavily on what goes on in a business-and typically, magazines</p>
<p>having the word management in their title (for example, Britain’s</p>
<p>Management Today or Germany’s Manager Magazin) concern them-</p>
<p>selves primarily if not exclusively with what goes on in business</p>
<p>enterprises-management has become the pervasive, the universal</p>
<p>organ of a modem society.</p>
<p>For modem society has become a “society of organizations.“ The</p>
<p>individual who conforms to what political and social theorists
still</p>
<p>consider the norm has become a small minority: the individual who</p>
<p>stands in society directly and on his own, with no intermediary
institu-</p>
<p>ion of which he is a member and an employee between himself and
the</p>
<p>sovereign government. The overwhelming majority of all people in</p>
<p>developed societies are employees of an organization; they derive
their</p>
<p>livelihood from the collective income of an organization; see
their</p>
<p>opportunity for career and success primarily as opportunity within
an</p>
<p>organization; and define their social status largely through their
posi-</p>
<p>ion within the ranks of an organization. Increasingly, especially in
the</p>
<p>United States, the only way in which the individual can amass a
little</p>
<p>property is through the pension fund, that is, through membership
in</p>
<p>an organization.</p>
<p>And each of these organization, in turn, depends for its
functioning</p>
<p>on management. Management makes an organization out of what</p>
<p>otherwise would be a mob. It is the effective, integrating,
life-giving</p>
<p>organ.</p>
<p>In a society of organizations, managing becomes a key social
func-</p>
<p>ion and management the constitutive, the determining, the
differential</p>
<p>organ of society.</p>
<p>Management: The Problems of Success 159</p>
<p>The New Pluralism</p>
<p>The dogma of the “liberal state“ is still taught in our
university</p>
<p>departments of government and in our law schools. According to it,
all</p>
<p>organized power is vested in one central government. But the
society</p>
<p>of organizations is a pluralist society. In open defiance of the
prevail-</p>
<p>ing dogma, it contains a diversity of organizations and power
centers.</p>
<p>And each has to have a management and has to be managed. The</p>
<p>business enterprise is only one; there are the labor unions and the
farm</p>
<p>organizations, the health-care institutions and the schools and
univer-</p>
<p>sities, not to mention the media. Indeed, even government is
increas-</p>
<p>ingly becoming a pluralist congeries of near-autonomous power
ten-</p>
<p>ers, very different indeed from the branches of government of the</p>
<p>American Constitution. There is the civil service, for instance. The
last</p>
<p>president of the United States who had effective control of the
civil</p>
<p>service was Franklin D. Roosevelt fifty years age; in England it
was</p>
<p>Winston Churchill; in Russia, Stalin. Since their time the civil
service</p>
<p>in all major countries has become an establishment in its own
right.</p>
<p>And so, increasingly, has the military.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century the “liberal state“ had to admit the
parties,</p>
<p>hough it did so grudgingly and with dire misgivings. But the
purpose</p>
<p>of the parties was the conquest of government. They were, so to
speak,</p>
<p>gears in the governmental machine and had neither existence nor</p>
<p>justification outside of it.</p>
<p>No such purpose animates the institutions of the new pluralism.</p>
<p>The institutions of the old pluralism, that is, of medieval Europe
or</p>
<p>of medieval Japan (the princes and the feudal barons, the free
cities,</p>
<p>he artisans, the bishoprics and abbeys) were themselves
governments.</p>
<p>Each indeed tried to annex as much of the plenitude of
governmental</p>
<p>power as it could get away with. Each levied taxes and collected</p>
<p>customs duties. Each strove to be granted the right to make laws,
and</p>
<p>o establish and run its own law courts. Each tried to confer
knight-</p>
<p>hoods, patents of nobility, or titles of citizenship. And each tried
to</p>
<p>obtain the most coveted right of them all, the right to mint its
own</p>
<p>coins.</p>
<p>But the purpose of today’s pluralist institution is
nongovernmental:</p>
<p>o make and to sell goods and services, to protect jobs and wages,
to</p>
<p>heal the sick, to teach the young, and so on. Each only exists to
do</p>
<p>something that is different form what government does or, indeed,
to</p>
<p>do something so that government need not do it.</p>
<p>The institutions of the old pluralism also saw themselves as
total</p>
<p>communities. Even the craft guild, the powerful woolen weavers of</p>
<p>Florence, for instance, organized itself primarily to control its
mem-</p>
<p>bers. Of course, weavers got paid for selling woolen goods to
other</p>
<p>people. But their guild tried as hard as possible to insulate the
members</p>
<p>against economic impacts from the outside by severely restricting
what</p>
<p>could be made, how much of it, and how and at what price it could
be</p>
<p>sold, and by whom. Every guild gathered its members into its own</p>
<p>quarter in the city, over which it exerted governmental control.
Every</p>
<p>one immediately built its own church with its own patron saint.
Every</p>
<p>one immediately built its own school; there is still “Merchant
Tay-</p>
<p>lor’s“ in London. Every one controlled access to membership in
the</p>
<p>guild. If the institutions of the old pluralism had to deal with
the</p>
<p>outside at all. they did so as “foreign relations“ through formal
pacts</p>
<p>alliances, feuds, and, often enough, open war. The outsider was a</p>
<p>foreigner.</p>
<p>The institutions of the new pluralism have no purpose except
outside</p>
<p>of themselves. They exist in contemplation of “customer“ or a
“mar-</p>
<p>ket.“ Achievement in the hospital is not a satisfied nurse, but a
cured</p>
<p>former patient. Achievement in business is not a happy work
force,</p>
<p>however desirable it may be; it is a satisfied customer who reorders
the</p>
<p>product.</p>
<p>All institutions of the new pluralism, unlike those of the old,
are</p>
<p>single-purpose institutions. They are tools of society to supply
one</p>
<p>specific social need, whether making or selling cars, giving
telephone</p>
<p>service, curing the sick, teaching children to read, or providing
benefit</p>
<p>checks to unemployed workers. To make this single, specific
contribu-</p>
<p>ion, they themselves need a considerable measure of autonomy,</p>
<p>however. They need to be organized in perpetuity, or at least for
long</p>
<p>periods of time. They need to dispose of a considerable amount of</p>
<p>society’s resources, of land, raw materials, and money, but above
all</p>
<p>of people, and especially of the scarcest resource of them all,
highly</p>
<p>rained and highly education people And they need a considerable</p>
<p>amount of power over people, and coercive power at that. It is only
too</p>
<p>Management: The Problems of Success 161</p>
<p>easy to forget that in the not-so-distant past, only slaves,
servants, and</p>
<p>convicts had to be at the job at a time set for them by someone
else.</p>
<p>This institution has-and has to have-power to bestow or to with-</p>
<p>hold social recognition and economic rewards. Whichever method we</p>
<p>use to select people for assignments and promotions-appointment</p>
<p>from above, selection by one’s peers, even rotation among jobs-it
is</p>
<p>always a power decision made for the individual rather than by
him,</p>
<p>and on the basis of impersonal criteria that are related to the
organiza-</p>
<p>ion’s purpose rather than to the individual’s purpose. The individual
is</p>
<p>hus, of necessity, subjected to a power grounded in the value
system</p>
<p>of whatever specific social purpose the institution has been created
to</p>
<p>satisfy.</p>
<p>And the organ through which this power is exercised in the
institu-</p>
<p>ion is the organ we call management.</p>
<p>This is new and quite unprecedented. We have neither political
nor</p>
<p>social theory for it as yet.</p>
<p>This new pluralism immediately raises the question, Who takes
care</p>
<p>of the commonweal when society is organized in individual power
ten-</p>
<p>ers, each concerned with a specific goal rather than with the
common</p>
<p>good?</p>
<p>Each institution in a pluralist society sees its own purpose as
the</p>
<p>central and the most important one. Indeed, it cannot do
otherwise.</p>
<p>The school, for instance, or the university could not function
unless</p>
<p>hey saw teaching and research as what makes a good society and
what</p>
<p>makes a good citizen. Surely nobody chooses to go into hospital</p>
<p>administration or into nursing unless he or she believes in health as
an</p>
<p>absolute value. And as countless failed mergers and acquisitions
attest,</p>
<p>no management will do a good job running a company unless it</p>
<p>believes in the product or service the company supplies, and unless
it</p>
<p>respects the company’s customers and their values.</p>
<p>Charles E. Wilson, GM’s chairman (later President Eisenhower’s</p>
<p>secretary of defense), never said, “What is good for General Motors
is</p>
<p>good for the country.“ What he actually said is “What is good for
the</p>
<p>country is good for General Motors, and vice versa.“ But that
Wilson</p>
<p>was misquoted is quite irrelevant. What matters is that everybody</p>
<p>believed that he not only said what he was misquoted to have said,
but</p>
<p>hat he actually believed it. And indeed no one could run General</p>
<p>Motors–or Harvard University, or Misericordia Hospital, or the</p>
<p>Bricklayers Union, or the Marine Corps-unless he believed that
what</p>
<p>is good for GM, or Harvard, or Misericordia, or the Bricklayers, or
the</p>
<p>Marines is indeed good for the country and is indeed a “mission,“
that</p>
<p>if not divinely ordained, is still essential to society.</p>
<p>Yet each of these missions is one and only one dimension of the</p>
<p>common good-important yes, indispensable perhaps, and yet a rela-</p>
<p>ive rather than an absolute good. As such, it must be limited,
weighed</p>
<p>in the balance with, and often subordinated to, other
considerations.</p>
<p>Somehow the common good must be made to emerge out of the clash</p>
<p>and clamor of special interests.</p>
<p>The old pluralism never solved this problem. This explains why</p>
<p>suppressing it became the “progressive cause“ and the one with
which</p>
<p>he moral philosophers of the modem age (that is, of the sixteenth</p>
<p>hrough the nineteenth centuries) aligned themselves.</p>
<p>Can the new pluralism do any better? One solution is, of course,
to</p>
<p>suppress the pluralist institutions. This is the answer given by
total-</p>
<p>itarianism and is indeed its true essence. The totalitarian state,
whether</p>
<p>it calls itself Fascist, Nazi, Stalinist, or Maoist, makes all
institutions</p>
<p>subservient to and extensions of the state (or of the omnipotent
party).</p>
<p>This saves the “state“ of modem political theory, but at the
sacrifice</p>
<p>of individual freedom, of free thought and free expression, and of
any</p>
<p>limitation on power altogether. The state (or the party) is then
indeed</p>
<p>he only power center, as traditional theory preaches. But it can</p>
<p>maintain its monopoly on power only by being based on naked
terror,</p>
<p>as Lenin was the first to realize. And even at that horrible price,
it does</p>
<p>not really work. As we now know-and the experience of all total-</p>
<p>itarian regimes is exactly the same, whether they call themselves
Right</p>
<p>or Left-the pluralist institutions persist behind the monolithic
facade.</p>
<p>They can be deprived of their autonomy only if they and society</p>
<p>ogether are rendered unable to perform, for instance, through
Stalin’s</p>
<p>purges or Mao’s Cultural Revolution. What the totalitarian
regimes</p>
<p>have proved is that modern society has to be a “society of
organiza-</p>
<p>ions,“ and that means a pluralist society. The only choice is
whether</p>
<p>individual freedom is being maintained or is being suppressed and</p>
<p>destroyed, albeit to no purpose other than naked power.</p>
<p>The opposite approach to that of the totalitarian is the American
one.</p>
<p>Management: The Problems of Success 163</p>
<p>The United States, alone among modem nations, never fully
accepted</p>
<p>he dogma of the liberal state. It opposed to it, quite early in its
history,</p>
<p>a pluralist political theory, that of John C. Calhoun’s
“concurrent</p>
<p>majority.“ In the way in which Calhoun presented his theory in
the</p>
<p>1830s and 1840s, that is, as a pluralism exercised through the
individu-</p>
<p>al states and intended to prevent the breakup of the Union over
slavery,</p>
<p>he “concurrent majority“ did not survive the Civil War. But
thirty</p>
<p>years later, Mark Hanna, the founder of the modern Republican
party</p>
<p>and of modem American politics altogether, reformulated Calhoun’s</p>
<p>pluralism as a concurrent majority of the major “interests“:
farmers,</p>
<p>workers, business. Each of these three “estates of the realm“ can</p>
<p>effectively veto the majority. It must not impose its will on the
others.</p>
<p>But it must be able to prevent the others from imposing their will on
it.</p>
<p>Another thirty years later, Franklin D. Roosevelt made this the
basic</p>
<p>political creed of the New Deal. In Roosevelt’s system government</p>
<p>became the arbiter whose job it is to make sure that no one interest
gets</p>
<p>oo powerful. When Roosevelt came in, “capital“-business as a term</p>
<p>came later, and management later still-appeared to be far too
power-</p>
<p>ful. Farmers and workers were thus organized to offset the
business</p>
<p>power. And then, not so many years later, when the labor power</p>
<p>seemed to become too great, farmers and business were organized
to</p>
<p>offset and balance labor power, and so on.</p>
<p>Each of the “interests“ is free to pursue its own goals regardless
of</p>
<p>he common good; it is indeed expected to do so. In the darkest days
of</p>
<p>World War 11, in 1943 when American troops still lacked arms and</p>
<p>ammunition, John L. Lewis, the founder of the Congress of
Industrial</p>
<p>Organizations (that is, of modern American unionism) and the
power-</p>
<p>ful head of the coal miners’ union, called a coal strike to get
higher</p>
<p>wages for his men, defying national wage controls. President
Roose-</p>
<p>velt attacked him publicly for endangering the nation’s survival.
Lewis</p>
<p>retorted: “The President of the United States is paid to look after
the</p>
<p>nation’s survival. I am paid to look after the interests of the
coal</p>
<p>miners.“ And while the newspapers attacked Lewis harshly, public</p>
<p>opinion apparently felt that Lewis had only said out aloud what
the</p>
<p>Roosevelt administration had practiced all along. It gave Lewis
enough</p>
<p>support to win the strike.</p>
<p>This example, however, shows that the American pluralist doctrine</p>
<p>is hardly adequate. Indeed, just as the old pluralism did, it has
given</p>
<p>birth to so many vested interests and pressure groups that it is
almost</p>
<p>impossible to conduct the business of government, let alone to
conduct</p>
<p>it for the common good.</p>
<p>In 1984-85 practically everyone in the United States agreed that
the</p>
<p>country needed a drastic tax reform to replace an increasingly
compli-</p>
<p>cated and irrational tax code, with a few tax rates and with
exemptions</p>
<p>eliminated. But no such code could be enacted. Every single
exemp-</p>
<p>ion became the sacred cause of a vested interest. And even though</p>
<p>some of them represented only a few hundred or a few thousand</p>
<p>voters, each of them could and did block tax reform.</p>
<p>Is there a way out? The Japanese seem to be the only ones so far
able</p>
<p>o reconcile a society of organizations with the pursuit of the
common</p>
<p>good. It is expected of the major Japanese interests that they take
their</p>
<p>cue from “what is good for the country“: Then they are expected to
fit</p>
<p>what is good for themselves into the framework of a public policy</p>
<p>designed to serve the national interest.</p>
<p>It is doubtful, however, whether even Japan can long maintain
this</p>
<p>approach. It reflects a past in which Japan saw herself as isolated
in a</p>
<p>hostile and alien world-so that all of Japan, regardless of
immediate</p>
<p>interests, had to hang together lest it hang separately. Will this
attitude</p>
<p>survive Japan’s success? And could such an approach have a chance
in</p>
<p>he West, where interests are expected to behave as interests?</p>
<p>Is this a problem of management, it will be asked? Is it not a</p>
<p>problem of politics, of government, or political philosophy? But
if</p>
<p>management does not tackle it, then almost inevitably there will
be</p>
<p>imposed political solutions. When, for instance, the health-care
insti-</p>
<p>utions in America, the hospitals and the medical profession, did
not</p>
<p>ake responsibility for spiraling health-care costs, government
imposed</p>
<p>restrictions on them, for example, the Medicare restrictions on the
care</p>
<p>of the aged in hospitals. These rules clearly are not concerned
with</p>
<p>health care at all and may even be detrimental to it. They are
designed</p>
<p>o serve short-run fiscal concerns of government and employers,
that</p>
<p>is, designed to substitute a different but equally one-sided approach
for</p>
<p>he one-sided, self-centered approach of the health-care “interests.
“</p>
<p>This must be the outcome unless the managements of the
institutions</p>
<p>of the new pluralism see it as their job to reconcile concern for
the</p>
<p>Management: The Problems of Success 165</p>
<p>common good with the pursuit of the special mission for the sake
of</p>
<p>which their institution exists.</p>
<p>The Legitimacy of Management</p>
<p>Power has to be legitimate. Otherwise it has only force and no
au-</p>
<p>hority, is only might and never right. To be legitimate, power has
to</p>
<p>be grounded outside of it in something transcending it that is
accepted</p>
<p>as a genuine value, if not as a true absolute by those subject to
the</p>
<p>power-whether descent from the gods or apostolic succession;
divine</p>
<p>institution or its modem, totalitarian counterpart the scientific
laws of</p>
<p>history; the consent of the governed, popular election or, as in so
much</p>
<p>of modem society, the magic of the advanced degree. If power is
an</p>
<p>end in itself, it becomes despotism and both illegitimate and
tyranni-</p>
<p>cal.</p>
<p>Management has to have power to do its job, whatever the
organiza-</p>
<p>ion. In that respect there is little difference between the
Catholic</p>
<p>diocese, the university, the hospital, the labor union, and the
business</p>
<p>enterprise. And because the governing organ of each of these
institu-</p>
<p>ions has to have power, it has to have legitimacy.</p>
<p>And here we encounter a puzzle. The management of the key</p>
<p>institutions of our society of organizations is by and large accepted
as</p>
<p>legitimate. The single exception is the management of the
business</p>
<p>enterprise. Business enterprise is seen as necessary and accepted
as</p>
<p>such. Indeed, society is often more concerned with the survival of
a</p>
<p>large business or an industry than it is with that of any other
single</p>
<p>institution. If a major business is in trouble, there is a crisis
and</p>
<p>desperate attempts to salvage the company. But at the same time,</p>
<p>business management is suspect. And any exercise of management</p>
<p>power is denounced as usurpation, with cries from all sides for
legisla-</p>
<p>ion or for judicial action to curb if not to suppress managerial
power</p>
<p>altogether.</p>
<p>One common explanation is that the large business enterprise
wields</p>
<p>more power than any other institution. But this simply does not
hold</p>
<p>water. Not only is business enterprise hemmed in in its power on
all</p>
<p>sides-by government and government regulations, by labor unions,</p>
<p>and so on. The power of even the largest and wealthiest business</p>
<p>enterprise is insignificant next to that of the university now that
a</p>
<p>college degree has become a prerequisite for access to any but the
most</p>
<p>menial jobs. The university and its management are often
criticized,</p>
<p>but their legitimacy is rarely questioned.</p>
<p>The large labor union in Western Europe and in American mass-</p>
<p>production industries surely has more power than any single
business</p>
<p>enterprise in its country or industry. Indeed in Western Europe, both
in</p>
<p>Britain and on the Continent, the large labor union became
society’s</p>
<p>most powerful institution in the period after World War 11, more</p>
<p>powerful sometimes than the nation’s government. The unions’
exer-</p>
<p>cise of their power during this period was only too often
self-serving, if</p>
<p>not irresponsible. But even their bitterest critics in Western Europe
and</p>
<p>in the United States rarely questioned the unions’ legitimacy.</p>
<p>Another explanation-the prevalent one these days-is that the</p>
<p>managements of all other institutions are altruistic, whereas
business is</p>
<p>profit-seeking and therefore out for itself and materialistic. But
even if</p>
<p>it is accepted that for many people nonprofit is virtuous, and
profit</p>
<p>dubious, if not outright sinful, the explanation that profit
undermines</p>
<p>he legitimacy of business management is hardly adequate. In all</p>
<p>Western countries the legitimacy of owners, that is, of real
capitalists,</p>
<p>and their profits is generally accepted without much question. That
of a</p>
<p>professional management is not, yet professional management
obtains</p>
<p>profits for other people rather than for itself-and its main
benefici-</p>
<p>aries today are the pension funds of employees.</p>
<p>And then there is the situation in Japan. In no other country,
not</p>
<p>even in France or in Sweden, was the intellectual climate of the</p>
<p>postwar period as hostile to “profit“ as in Japan, at least until
1975 or</p>
<p>so. The left-wing intelligentsia of Japan in the universities or
the</p>
<p>newspapers might have wanted to nationalize Japan’s big
businesses.</p>
<p>But it never occurred even to the purest Marxist among them to</p>
<p>question the necessity of management or its legitimacy.</p>
<p>The explanation clearly lies in the image which Japanese manage-</p>
<p>ment has of itself and which it presents to its society. In Japanese
law,</p>
<p>as in American and European law, management is the servant of the</p>
<p>stockholders. But this the Japanese treat as pure fiction. The
reality</p>
<p>which is seen as guiding the behavior of Japanese big-business
man-</p>
<p>agement (even in companies that are family-owned and family-</p>
<p>managed like Toyota) is management as an organ of the business
itself.</p>
<p>Management: The Problems of Success 167</p>
<p>Management is the servant of the going concern, which brings
together</p>
<p>in a common interest a number of constituencies: employees first,
then</p>
<p>customers, then creditors, and finally suppliers. Stockholders are
only</p>
<p>a special group of creditors, rather than “the owners“ for whose
sake</p>
<p>he enterprise exists. As their performance shows, Japanese
businesses</p>
<p>are not run as philanthropies and know how to obtain economic
results.</p>
<p>In fact, the Japanese banks, which are the real powers in the
Japanese</p>
<p>economy, watch economic performance closely and move in on a</p>
<p>poorly performing or lackluster top management much faster than
do</p>
<p>he boards of Western publicly held companies. But the Japanese
have</p>
<p>institutionalized the going concern and its values through
lifetime</p>
<p>employment, under which the employees’ claim to job and income</p>
<p>comes first-unless the survival of the enterprise itself is
endangered.</p>
<p>The Japanese formulation presents very real problems, especially
at</p>
<p>a time of rapid structural change in technology and economy when</p>
<p>labor mobility is badly needed. Still, the Japanese example
indicates</p>
<p>why management legitimacy is a problem in the West. Business</p>
<p>management in the West (and in particular business management in
the</p>
<p>United States) has not yet faced up to the fact that our society
has</p>
<p>become a society of organizations of which management is the
critical</p>
<p>organ.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago or so, when the serious study of management</p>
<p>began, Ralph Cordiner, then CEO of the General Electric Company,</p>
<p>ried to reformulate the responsibility of corporate top
management.</p>
<p>He spoke of its being the “trustee for the balanced best interest
of</p>
<p>stockholders, employees, customers, suppliers and plant communi-</p>
<p>ies“-the groups which would now be called stakeholders or consti-</p>
<p>uencies. As a slogan this caught on fast. Countless other
American</p>
<p>companies wrote it into their Corporate Philosophy statement. But</p>
<p>neither Mr. Cordiner nor any of the other chairmen and presidents
who</p>
<p>embraced his rhetoric did what the Japanese have done:
institutionalize</p>
<p>heir professions. They did not think through what the
best-balanced</p>
<p>interest of these different stakeholders would mean, how to judge</p>
<p>performance against such an objective, and how to create accoun-</p>
<p>ability for it. The statement remained good intentions. And good</p>
<p>intentions are not enough to make power legitimate. In fact, good</p>
<p>intentions as the grounds for power characterize the “enlightened</p>
<p>despot.“ And enlightened despotism never works.</p>
<p>The term enlightened despot was coined in the eighteenth century-</p>
<p>with Voltaire probably its greatest and most enthusiastic
exponent-</p>
<p>when the divine right of princes was no longer generally accepted as
a</p>
<p>ground of legitimate power. The prince with the best intentions
among</p>
<p>eighteenth-century enlightened despots and the very model of the</p>
<p>progressive, the enlightened liberal, was the Austrian emperor
Joseph</p>
<p>I1 (reigned 1765-90). Every one of the reforms that he pioneered was
a</p>
<p>step in the right direction-the abolition of torture; religious
toleration</p>
<p>for Protestants, Jews, and even atheists; universal free education
and</p>
<p>public hospitals in every county; abolition of serfdom; codification
of</p>
<p>he laws; and so on. Yet his subjects, and especially his subjects in
the</p>
<p>most advanced parts of his empire, the Austrian Netherlands, rose</p>
<p>against him in revolt. And when, a few years later, the French
Revolu-</p>
<p>ion broke out, the enlightened despots of Europe toppled like
nine-</p>
<p>pins. They had no constituency to support them.</p>
<p>Because Ralph Cordiner and his contemporaries never even tried to</p>
<p>ground management power in institutional arrangements, their
asser-</p>
<p>ion very rapidly became enlightened despotism. In the 1950s and</p>
<p>1960s it became corporate capitalism, in which an enlightened
“pro-</p>
<p>fessional“ management has absolute power within its corporation,</p>
<p>controlled only by itself and irremovable except in the event of
catas-</p>
<p>rophe. “Stock ownership,“ it was argued, had come to be so widely</p>
<p>dispersed that shareholders no longer could interfere, let alone
exercise</p>
<p>control.</p>
<p>But this is hubris: arrogance and sinful pride, which always
rides</p>
<p>before a fall. Within ten years after it had announced the
independence</p>
<p>of management in the large, publicly owned corporation,
“corporate</p>
<p>capitalism“ began to collapse. For one, stock ownership came to
be</p>
<p>concentrated again, in the hands of the pension funds.</p>
<p>And then inflation distorted values, as it always does, so that
stock</p>
<p>prices, which are based on earnings expectations, came to appear
far</p>
<p>lower than book values and liquidation values. The result was the
wave</p>
<p>of hostile takeovers that has been inundating the American
economy</p>
<p>hese last years and is spilling over into Europe now. Underlying it
is</p>
<p>he assertion that the business enterprise exists, and solely, for the
sake</p>
<p>of stockholder profits, and short-run, immediate profits at that.</p>
<p>By now it has become accepted widely-except on Wall Street and</p>
<p>among Wall Street lawyers-that the hostile takeover is
deleterious</p>
<p>Management: The Problems of Success 169</p>
<p>and in fact one of the major causes of the loss of America’s
competi-</p>
<p>ive position in the world economy. One way or another, the
hostile</p>
<p>akeover will be stopped. It may be through a “crash;“ speculative</p>
<p>booms always collapse in the end. It may be through such changes
as</p>
<p>switching to different classes of common stock, with the shares
owned</p>
<p>by the outside public having a fraction of the voting power of
the</p>
<p>insiders’ shares, or by giving up voting rights for publicly held
com-</p>
<p>mon shares altogether. (I owe this suggestion to Mr. Walter
Wriston,</p>
<p>he chairman emeritus of New York’s Citibank.)</p>
<p>No matter how the hostile takeover boom is finally stopped, it
will</p>
<p>have made certain that the problem of management legitimacy has
to</p>
<p>be tackled. We know some of the specifications for the solution.
There</p>
<p>have to be proper safeguards of the economic performance of a
busi-</p>
<p>ness: its market standing, the quality of its products or services,
and its</p>
<p>performance as an innovator. There has to be emphasis on, and
control</p>
<p>of, financial performance. If the takeover boom has taught us one</p>
<p>hing, it is that management must not be allowed substandard
financial</p>
<p>performance.</p>
<p>But somehow the various “stakeholders“ also have to be brought</p>
<p>into the management process (for example, through the company’s</p>
<p>pension plan as a representative of the company’s employees for
whom</p>
<p>he pension plan is the trustee). And somehow the maintenance of
the</p>
<p>wealth-producing and the job-producing capacity of the enterprise,
that</p>
<p>is, the maintenance of the going concern, needs to be built into
our</p>
<p>legal and institutional arrangements. It should not be too
difficult.</p>
<p>After all, we built the preservation of the going concern into
our</p>
<p>bankruptcy laws all of ninety years ago when we gave it priority
over</p>
<p>all other claims, including the claims of the creditors. But whatever
the</p>
<p>specifics, business management has to attain legitimacy; its power
has</p>
<p>o be grounded in a justification outside and beyond it and has to
be</p>
<p>given the “constitutional“ sanction it still largely lacks.</p>
<p>Closely connected to the problem of the legitimacy of management</p>
<p>is management’s compensation.</p>
<p>Management, to be legitimate, must be accepted as “professional.“</p>
<p>Professionals have always been paid well and deserve to be paid
well.</p>
<p>But it has always been considered unprofessional to put money
ahead</p>
<p>of professional responsibility and professional standards. This
means</p>
<p>hat there have to be limitations on managerial incomes. It is surely
not</p>
<p>professional for a chief executive officer to give himself a bonus
of</p>
<p>several millions at the very time at which the pay of the
company’s</p>
<p>other employees is cut by 30 percent, as the chief executive officer
of</p>
<p>Chrysler did a few years ago. It is surely not professional
altogether for</p>
<p>people who are employees and not “owners“ to pay themselves</p>
<p>salaries and bonuses greatly in excess of what their own
colleagues,</p>
<p>hat is, other members of management, receive. And it is not
profes-</p>
<p>sional to pay oneself salaries and bonuses that are so far above
the</p>
<p>norm as to create social tension, envy, and resentment. Indeed there
is</p>
<p>no economic justification for very large executive incomes.
German</p>
<p>and Japanese top managers surely do as good a job as American top</p>
<p>managers-perhaps, judging by results, an even better one. Yet
their</p>
<p>incomes are, at the most, half of what American chief executives
of</p>
<p>companies in similar industries and of similar size are sometimes
being</p>
<p>paid.</p>
<p>But there is also work to be done on the preparation, testing,
and</p>
<p>selection of, and on the succession to, the top-management jobs in
the</p>
<p>large business enterprises; on the structure of top management; and
on</p>
<p>performance standards for top management and the institutional
ar-</p>
<p>rangements for monitoring and enforcing them.</p>
<p>Business management is not yet fully accepted as legitimate in
the</p>
<p>West because it has not yet realized the full implications of its
success.</p>
<p>Individual executives, even those of the biggest company, are
largely</p>
<p>anonymous. They only make asses of themselves if they try to
behave</p>
<p>as if they were aristocrats. They are hired hands like the rest of
us. On</p>
<p>he day on which they retire and move out of the executive suite
they</p>
<p>become “nonpersons“ even in their old company. But while in
office</p>
<p>hey represent; individually almost faceless, collectively they
consti-</p>
<p>ute a governing group. As such their behavior is seen as
representa-</p>
<p>ive. What is private peccadillo for ordinary mortals becomes
repre-</p>
<p>hensible misconduct and indeed betrayal if done by a leader. For
not</p>
<p>only is the leader visible; it is his duty to set an example.</p>
<p>But then there is also the big question of what is now being
called</p>
<p>he “social responsibility“ of management. It is not, despite all
rheto-</p>
<p>ric to the contrary, a social responsibility of business but of all
institu-</p>
<p>ions–otherwise we would hardly have all the malpractice suits
against</p>
<p>American hospitals or all the suits alleging discrimination
against</p>
<p>American colleges and universities. But business is surely one of
the</p>
<p>Management: The Problems of Success 171</p>
<p>key institutions of a society of organizations and as such needs
to</p>
<p>determine what its social responsibilities are-and what they are
not.</p>
<p>Surely business, like anyone else, is responsible for its
impacts:</p>
<p>responsibility for one’s impacts is, after all, one of the oldest
tenets of</p>
<p>he law. And surely, business, like anyone else, is in violation of
its</p>
<p>responsibilities if it allows itself impacts beyond those necessary
to,</p>
<p>and implicit in, its social purpose, for example, producing goods
and</p>
<p>services. To overstep these limits constitutes a tort, that is, a
violation.</p>
<p>But what about problems that do not result from an impact or any</p>
<p>other activity of business and yet constitute grave social ills?
Clearly it</p>
<p>is not a responsibility of business, or of any organization, to act
where</p>
<p>it lacks competence; to do so is not responsibility but
irresponsibility.</p>
<p>Thus when a former mayor of New York City in the 1960s called for</p>
<p>“General Electric and the other big corporations of New York City
to</p>
<p>help solve the problem of the Black Ghetto by making sure that there
is</p>
<p>a man and father in the home of every Black Welfare Mother,“ he
was</p>
<p>not only ridiculous. He demanded irresponsibility.</p>
<p>But also management must not accept “responsibility“ if by doing</p>
<p>so it harms and impedes what is its first duty: the economic
perfor-</p>
<p>mance of the enterprise. This is equally irresponsible.</p>
<p>But beyond these caveats there is a no-man’s-land where we do not</p>
<p>even fully understand what the right questions are. The problems
of</p>
<p>New York, for instance, are in no way caused by business. They
were</p>
<p>largely caused by public policies business had warned against and</p>
<p>fought against: primarily by rent control, which, as it always
does,</p>
<p>destroys the very housing the poor need, that is, decent, well-</p>
<p>maintained older housing; by demagogic welfare policies; and by</p>
<p>equally demagogic labor-relations policies. And yet when New York</p>
<p>City was on the verge of self-destruction, in the late 1960s and
early</p>
<p>1970s, a small group of senior executives of major New York
business</p>
<p>enterprises mobilized the business community to reverse the down-</p>
<p>ward slide and to renew New York City-people like Austin Tobin of</p>
<p>he Port of New York Authority; David Rockefeller of the Chase</p>
<p>Manhattan Bank; Walter Wriston and William Spencer of Citibank;</p>
<p>Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Frkres, the private bankers; the top
manage-</p>
<p>ment of Pfizer, a pharmaceutical company; and several others.
They</p>
<p>did this not by “taking responsibility“ for things they lacked
compe-</p>
<p>ence in, for example, the problems of the black ghetto. They did it
by</p>
<p>doing what they were highly competent to do: they started and led
the</p>
<p>most dramatic architectural development of any major city since</p>
<p>Napoleon I11 had created a new Paris and Francis Joseph a new
Vienna</p>
<p>a hundred years earlier. The black ghetto is still there, and so are
all the</p>
<p>ills associated with it, for example, crime on the streets. But the
city</p>
<p>has been revitalized.</p>
<p>And this did not happen because these businesses and their
manage-</p>
<p>ments needed the city; excepting only the Port of New York
Authority,</p>
<p>hey could all have moved out, as a good many of their colleagues-</p>
<p>IBM, for instance, or General Electric, or Union Carbide-were do-</p>
<p>ing. These businesses and their top managements acted because the</p>
<p>city needed them, though, of course, they benefited in the end if
only</p>
<p>because a business-and any other institution–does better in a
healthy</p>
<p>rather than a diseased social environment.</p>
<p>Is there a lesson in this? There surely is a challenge.</p>
<p>Altogether, for management of the big business to attain full
legit-</p>
<p>imacy, it will have to accept that to remain “private“ it has to
accept</p>
<p>hat it discharges a social, and that means a “public,“ function.</p>
<p>The Job as Property Right</p>
<p>When, in 1985, a fair-size Japanese company found itself suddenly</p>
<p>hreatened by a hostile takeover bid made by a group of American
and</p>
<p>British “raidersu-the first such bid in recent Japanese
history-the</p>
<p>company’s management asserted that the real owners of the
business,</p>
<p>and the only ones who could possibly sell it, were not the
stockholders,</p>
<p>but the employees. This was considerable exaggeration, to be
sure.</p>
<p>The real owners of a major Japanese company are the banks, as has</p>
<p>already been said. But it is true that the rights of the employees to
their</p>
<p>jobs are the first and overriding claim in a large Japanese
company,</p>
<p>except when the business faces a crisis so severe that its very
survival</p>
<p>is at stake.</p>
<p>To Western ears the Japanese company statement sounded very</p>
<p>strange. But actually the United States-and the West in
general-may</p>
<p>be as far along in making the employees the dominant interest in</p>
<p>business enterprise, and not only in the large one as in Japan.
All</p>
<p>along, of course, the employees’ share of the revenues of a
business,</p>
<p>almost regardless of size, exceeds what the “owners“ can possibly</p>
<p>Management: The Problems of Success 173</p>
<p>hope to get: ranging from being four times as large (that is, 7
percent</p>
<p>for after-tax profits, as against 25 percent for wages and salaries)
to</p>
<p>being twelve times as large (that is, 5 percent for profits versus
60</p>
<p>percent of revenues for wages and salaries). The pension fund not
only</p>
<p>greatly increased the share of the revenues that go into the
“wage</p>
<p>fund,“ to the point that in poor years the pension fund may claim
the</p>
<p>entire profit and more. American law now also gives the pension
fund</p>
<p>priority over the stockholders and their property rights in a
company’s</p>
<p>liquidation, way beyond anything Japanese law and Japanese custom</p>
<p>give to the Japanese worker.</p>
<p>Above all, the West, with the United States in the lead, is
rapidly</p>
<p>converting the individual employee’s job into a new property
right</p>
<p>and, paradoxically, at the very time at which the absolute primacy
of</p>
<p>stockholder short-term rights is being asserted in and by the
hostile</p>
<p>akeover.</p>
<p>The vehicle for this transformation in the United States is not
the</p>
<p>union contract or laws mandating severance pay as in many
European</p>
<p>countries. The vehicle is the lawsuit. First came the suit
alleging</p>
<p>discrimination, whether in hiring an employee, in firing, in
promotion,</p>
<p>in pay, or in job assignment4iscrimination on grounds of race or
sex</p>
<p>or age or handicap. But increasingly these suits do not even
allege</p>
<p>discrimination, but violation of “due process.“ They claim that
the</p>
<p>employer has to treat the employee’s job, including the
employee’s</p>
<p>expectations for pay and promotion, as something the enjoyment of</p>
<p>which and of its fruits can be diminished or taken away only on
the</p>
<p>basis of preset and objective standards and through an
established</p>
<p>process which includes an impartial review and the right to appeal.
But</p>
<p>hese are the features that characterize “property“ in the history of
the</p>
<p>law. In fact, they are the only features a right must possess to be
called</p>
<p>property in the Western legal tradition.</p>
<p>And as few managements yet seem to realize, in practically every</p>
<p>such suit the plaintiff wins and the employer loses.</p>
<p>This development was predictable. Indeed, it was inevitable. And
it</p>
<p>is irreversible. It is also not “novel“ or “radical.“ What gives
access</p>
<p>o a society’s productive resources-gives access thereby to a
liveli-</p>
<p>hood and to social function and status and constitutes a major, if
not</p>
<p>he major, avenue to economic independence however modest-has</p>
<p>always become a “property right“ in Western society. And this is</p>
<p>what the job has become, and especially the knowledge worker’s
job</p>
<p>as a manager or a professional.</p>
<p>We still call land “real“ property. For until quite recently it
was</p>
<p>land alone that gave to the great majority of mankind-95 percent
or</p>
<p>more-what “property“ gives: access to, and control over,
society’s</p>
<p>productive resources; access to a livelihood and to social status
and</p>
<p>function; and finally a chance at an estate (the term itself meant,
at</p>
<p>first, a landholding) and with it economic independence.</p>
<p>In today’s developed societies, however, the overwhelming major-</p>
<p>ity-all but 5 or 10 percent of the population-find access to and</p>
<p>control over productive resources and access to a livelihood and
to</p>
<p>social status and function through being employees of
organizations,</p>
<p>hat is, through their jobs. For highly educated people the job is</p>
<p>practically the only access route. Ninety-five percent, or more, of
all</p>
<p>people with college degrees will spend their entire working lives
as</p>
<p>employees of an organization. Modern organization is the first, and
so</p>
<p>far the only, place where we can put large numbers of highly
educated</p>
<p>people to productive work and pay them for applying knowledge.</p>
<p>For the great majority of Americans, moreover, the pension fund
at</p>
<p>heir place of employment is their only access to an “estate,“ that is
to</p>
<p>a little economic independence. By the time the main breadwinner
in</p>
<p>he American family, white collar or blue collar, is forty-five
years</p>
<p>old, the claim to the pension fund is likely to be the family’s
largest</p>
<p>asset, far exceeding in value the equity in the home or the
family’s</p>
<p>personal belongings, for example, their automobiles.</p>
<p>Thus the job had to become a property right-the only question is
in</p>
<p>what form and how fast.</p>
<p>Working things like this out through lawsuits may be “as American</p>
<p>as apple pie,“ but is hardly as wholesome. There is still a chance
for</p>
<p>management to take the initiative in this development and to shape
the</p>
<p>new property rights in the job so that they equally serve the
employee,</p>
<p>he company, and the economy. We need to maintain flexibility of</p>
<p>employment. We need to make it possible for a company to hire new</p>
<p>people and to increase its employment. And this means that we
must</p>
<p>avoid the noose the Europeans have put around their neck: the
sever-</p>
<p>ance pay which the law of so many Continental countries mandates</p>
<p>makes it so expensive to lay off anybody that companies simply do
not</p>
<p>hire people. That Belgium and Holland have such extraordinary
high</p>
<p>Management: The Problems of Success 175</p>
<p>unemployment is almost entirely the result of these countries’
sever-</p>
<p>ance pay laws. But whichever way we structure the new property</p>
<p>rights which the job embodies, there will be several requirements</p>
<p>which every employer, that is, every organization, will have to
satisfy.</p>
<p>First, there must be objective and equal performance standards
for</p>
<p>everyone performing a given job, regardless of race, color, sex,
or</p>
<p>age. Secondly, to satisfy the requirements of due process, the
appraisal</p>
<p>against these standards of performance has to be reviewed by
some-</p>
<p>body who is truly disinterested. Finally, due process demands a
right</p>
<p>of appeal-something, which by the way, as “authoritarian“ a
compa-</p>
<p>ny as IBM has had for more than half a century.</p>
<p>The evolution of the job into a “property right“ changes the
posi-</p>
<p>ion of the individual within the organization. It will change
equally, if</p>
<p>not more, the position of the organization in society. For it will
make</p>
<p>clear what at present is still nebulous: organized and managed
institu-</p>
<p>ions have increasingly become the organs of opportunity, of
achieve-</p>
<p>ment, and of fulfillment for the individual in the society of
organiza-</p>
<p>ions.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>There is still important work ahead-and a great deal of it-in
areas</p>
<p>hat are conventionally considered “management“ in the schools of</p>
<p>management, in management journals, and by practicing managers</p>
<p>hemselves. But the major challenges are new ones, and well beyond</p>
<p>he field of management as we commonly define it. Indeed, it will
be</p>
<p>argued that the challenges I have been discussing are not
management</p>
<p>at all, but belong in political and social theory and public law.</p>
<p>Precisely. The success of management has not changed the work of</p>
<p>management. But it has greatly changed management’s meaning. Its</p>
<p>success has made management the general, the pervasive function,
and</p>
<p>he distinct organ of our society of organizations. As such,
manage-</p>
<p>ment inevitably has become “affected with the public interest.“
To</p>
<p>work out what this means for management theory and management</p>
<p>practice will constitute the “management problems“ of the next
fifty</p>
<p>years.</p>
