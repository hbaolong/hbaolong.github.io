<h4 id="technology-science-and-culture">Technology, Science, and
Culture</h4>
<p>The standard answer to the question, “What brought about the</p>
<p>explosive change in the human condition these last two hundred</p>
<p>years?“ is “The Progress of Science.“ This paper enters a
demurrer.</p>
<p>It argues that the right answer is more likely: “A fundamental
change</p>
<p>in the concept of technology.“ Central to this was the reordering of
old</p>
<p>echnologies into systematic public disciplines with their own
concep-</p>
<p>ual equipment, for example, the “differential diagnosis“ of nine-</p>
<p>eenth-century medicine. In the century between 1750 and 1850 the</p>
<p>hree main technologies of man-Agriculture, the Mechanical Arts</p>
<p>(today’s Engineering), and Medicine-went in rapid succession</p>
<p>hrough this process, which resulted almost immediately in an
agri-</p>
<p>cultural, an industrial, and a medical “revolution“ respectively.</p>
<p>This process owed little or nothing to the new knowledge of
contem-</p>
<p>porary science. In fact, in every technology the practice with its
rules</p>
<p>of thumb was far ahead of science. Technology, therefore, became
the</p>
<p>spur to science; it took, for instance, seventy-five years until
Clausius</p>
<p>and Kelvin could give a scientific formulation to the
thermodynamic</p>
<p>behavior of Watt’s steam engine. Science could, indeed, have had
no</p>
<p>impact on the Technological Revolution until the transformation
from</p>
<p>craft to technological discipline had first been completed.</p>
<p>But technology had an immediate impact on science, which was</p>
<p>ransformed by the emergence of systematic technology. The change</p>
<p>was the most fundamental one-a change in science’s own definition</p>
<p>First published in Technology and Culture, 1961.</p>
<p>and image of itself. From being “natural philosophy“, science
became</p>
<p>a social institution. The words in which science defined itself
remained</p>
<p>unchanged: “the systematic search for rational knowledge“. But</p>
<p>“knowledge“ changed its meaning from being “understanding“, that</p>
<p>is, focused on man’s mind, to being “control“, that is, focused
on</p>
<p>application in and through technology. Instead of raising, as
science</p>
<p>had always done, fundamental problems of metaphysics, it came to</p>
<p>raise, as it rarely had before, fundamental social and political
prob-</p>
<p>lems.</p>
<p>It would be claiming too much to say that technology established</p>
<p>itself as the paramount power over science. But it was technology
that</p>
<p>built the future home, took out the marriage license, and hurried
a</p>
<p>rather reluctant science through the ceremony. And it is
technology</p>
<p>hat gives the union of the two its character; it is a coupling of
science</p>
<p>o technology, rather than a coupling of science and technology.</p>
<p>The evidence indicates that the key to this change lies in new
basic</p>
<p>concepts regarding technology, that is, in a genuine
Technological</p>
<p>Revolution with its own causes and its own dynamics.</p>
<p>Of all major technologies medicine alone has been taught system-</p>
<p>atically for any length of time. An unbroken line leads back for
one</p>
<p>housand years, from the medical school of today to the medical</p>
<p>schools of the Arab caliphates. The trail, though partly
overgrown,</p>
<p>goes back, another fourteen hundred years, through the School of</p>
<p>Alexandria to Hippocrates. From the beginning, medical schools</p>
<p>aught both theoretical knowledge and clinical practice, engaged
si-</p>
<p>multaneously, therefore, in science and technology. Unlike any
other</p>
<p>echnologist in the West, the medical practitioner has
continuously</p>
<p>enjoyed social esteem and position.</p>
<p>Yet, until very late-1850 or thereabouts-there was no organized</p>
<p>or predictable relationship between scientific knowledge and
medical</p>
<p>practice. The one major contribution to health care which the
West</p>
<p>made in the Middle Ages was the invention of spectacles. The
gener-</p>
<p>ally accepted date is 1286; by 1290 the use of eyeglasses is fully
docu-</p>
<p>mented.’ This invention was, almost certainly, based directly
upon</p>
<p>brand-new scientific knowledge, most probably on Roger Bacon’s</p>
<p>optical experiments. Yet Bacon was still alive when spectacles
came</p>
<p>in-he died in 1294. Until the nineteenth century there is no
other</p>
<p>Technology, Science, and Culture 289</p>
<p>example of such all but instantaneous translation of new
scientific</p>
<p>knowledge into technology-least of all in medicine. Yet Galen’s</p>
<p>heory of vision, which ruled out any mechanical correction, was</p>
<p>aught in the medical schools until 1700.2</p>
<p>Four hundred years later, in the age of Galileo, medicine took</p>
<p>another big step-Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of the
blood,</p>
<p>he first major new knowledge since the Ancients. Another hundred</p>
<p>years, the Jenner’s smallpox vaccination brought both the first
specific</p>
<p>reatment and the first prevention of a major disease.</p>
<p>Harvey’s findings disproved every single one of the theoretical</p>
<p>assumptions that underlay the old clinical practice of bleeding.
By</p>
<p>1700 Harvey’s findings were taught in every medical school and</p>
<p>repeated in every medical text. Yet bleeding remained the core of</p>
<p>medical practice and a universal panacea for another hundred
years,</p>
<p>and was still applied liberally around 1850.’ What killed it finally
was</p>
<p>not scientific knowledge-available and accepted for two hundred</p>
<p>years-but clinical observation.</p>
<p>In contrast to Harvey, Jenner’s achievement was essentially
techno-</p>
<p>logical and without any basis in theory. It is perhaps the greatest
feat of</p>
<p>clinical observation. Smallpox vaccination had hard sledding-it
was,</p>
<p>after all, a foolhardy thing deliberately to give oneself the dreaded
pox.</p>
<p>But what no one seemed to pay any attention to was the complete</p>
<p>incompatibility of Jenner’s treatment with any biological or
medical</p>
<p>heory of the time, or of any time thereafter until Pasteur, one
hundred</p>
<p>years later. That no one, apparently, saw fit to try explaining
vaccina-</p>
<p>ion or to study the phenomenon of immunity appears to us strange</p>
<p>enough. But how can one explain that the same doctors who
practised</p>
<p>vaccination, for a century continued to teach theories which
vaccina-</p>
<p>ion had rendered absurd?</p>
<p>The only explanation is that science and technology were not seen
as</p>
<p>having anything to do with one another. To us it is commonplace
that</p>
<p>scientific knowledge is being translated into technology, and
vice</p>
<p>versa. This assumption explains the violence of the arguments
regard-</p>
<p>ing the historical relationship between science and the “useful
arts“.</p>
<p>But the assumptions of the debate are invalid: the presence of a
tie</p>
<p>proves as little as its absence-it is our age, not the past, which
pre-</p>
<p>sumes consistency between theory and practice.</p>
<p>The basic difference was not in the content but in the focus of
the</p>
<p>wo areas. Science was a branch of philosophy, concerned with
under-</p>
<p>standing. Its object was to elevate the human mind. It was misuse
and</p>
<p>degradation of science to use it-Plato’s famous argument.
Technolo-</p>
<p>gy, on the other hand, was focused on use. Its object was increase
of</p>
<p>he human capacity to do. Science dealt with the most general,
tech-</p>
<p>nologies with the most concrete. Any resemblances between the two</p>
<p>were ’purely <sub>oincidental’.</sub> There are no hard and fast
dates for a</p>
<p>major change in an attitude, a world view. And the Technological</p>
<p>Revolution was nothing less. We do know, however, that it
occurred</p>
<p>within the half-century 1720 to 1770-the half-century that
separates</p>
<p>Newton from Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>Few people today realize that Swift’s famous encomium on the man</p>
<p>who makes two blades grow where one grew before, was not in
praise</p>
<p>of the scientists. On the contrary, it was the final, crushing
argument in</p>
<p>a biting attack on them, and especially against the august Royal</p>
<p>Society. It was meant to extol the sanity and benefits of
nonscientific</p>
<p>echnology against the arrogant sterility of an idle inquiry into
nature</p>
<p>concerned with understanding; this is against Newtonian Science,</p>
<p>for Swift was, as always, on the unpopular side. But his basic</p>
<p>assumption-that science and application were radically different
and</p>
<p>worlds apart-was clearly the prevailing one in the opening decades
of</p>
<p>he eighteenth century. No one scientist spoke out against the
weirdest</p>
<p>echnological “projects“ of the South Sea Bubble of 1720, even</p>
<p>hough their theoretical infeasibility must have been obvious to
them.</p>
<p>Many, Sir Isaac Newton taking the lead, invested heavily in
them.5</p>
<p>And while Newton, as Master of the Royal Mint, reformed its
business</p>
<p>practices, he did not much bother with its technology.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, around 1770, Dr Franklin is the “philosopher“
par</p>
<p>excellence and the West’s scientific lion. Franklin, though a
first-rate</p>
<p>scientist, owed his fame to his achievements as a technologist-</p>
<p>“artisan“ in eighteenth-century parlance. He was a brilliant
gadgeteer,</p>
<p>as witness the Franklin stove and bifocals. Of his major
scientific</p>
<p>exploits, one-the investigation of atmospheric electricity-was
im-</p>
<p>mediately turned into useful application: the lightning rod.
Another,</p>
<p>his pioneering work in oceanography with its discovery of the
Gulf</p>
<p>Stream, was undertaken for the express purpose of application,
name-</p>
<p>ly, to speed up the transatlantic mail service. Yet the scientists
hailed</p>
<p>Franklin as enthusiastically as did the general public.</p>
<p>Technology, Science, and Culture 291</p>
<p>In the fifty years between 1720 and 1770-not a particularly
distin-</p>
<p>guished period in the history of science, by the way-a
fundamental</p>
<p>change in the attitude towards technology, both of laity and of
scien-</p>
<p>ists, must have taken place. One indication is the change in
English</p>
<p>attitude towards patents. During the South Sea Bubble they were
still</p>
<p>unpopular and attacked as “monopolies“. They were still given to</p>
<p>political favorites rather than to an inventor. By 1775 when Watt</p>
<p>obtained his patent, they had become the accepted means of
encourag-</p>
<p>ing and rewarding technological progress.</p>
<p>We know in detail what happened to technology in the period which</p>
<p>includes both the Agricultural Revolution and the opening of the</p>
<p>Industrial Revolution. Technology as we know it today, that is,
sys-</p>
<p>ematic, organized work on the material tools of man, was born then.
It</p>
<p>was produced by collecting and organizing existing knowledge, by</p>
<p>applying it systematically, and by publishing it. Of these steps the
last</p>
<p>one was both the most novel–craft skill was not for nothing called
a</p>
<p>“mystery“-and the most important.</p>
<p>The immediate effect of the emergence of technology was not only</p>
<p>rapid technological progress: it was the establishment of
technologies</p>
<p>as systematic disciplines to be taught and learned and, finally,
the</p>
<p>reorientation of science towards feeding these new disciplines of
tech-</p>
<p>nological application.</p>
<p>Agriculture6 and the mechanical arts7 changed at the same time,</p>
<p>hough independently.</p>
<p>Beginning with such men as Jethro Tull and his systematic work on</p>
<p>horse-drawn cultivating machines in the early years of the
seventeenth</p>
<p>century and culminating towards its end in Coke of Holkham’s work</p>
<p>on balanced large-scale farming and selective livestock breeding,
agri-</p>
<p>culture changed from a “way of life“ into an industry. Yet this
work</p>
<p>would have had little impact but for the systematic publication of
the</p>
<p>new approach, especially by Arthur Young. This assured both rapid</p>
<p>adoption and continuing further work. As a result, yields doubled</p>
<p>while manpower needs were cut in half-which alone made possible</p>
<p>hat large-scale shift of labor from the land into the city and
from</p>
<p>producing food to consuming food on which the Industrial
Revolution</p>
<p>depended.</p>
<p>Around 1780, Albrecht Thaer in Germany, an enthusiastic follower</p>
<p>of the English, founded the first agricultural college-a college not
of</p>
<p>“farming“ but of “agriculture“. This in turn, still in Thaer’s
lifetime,</p>
<p>produced the first, specifically application-focused new
knowledge,</p>
<p>namely, Liebig’s work on the nutrition of plants, and the first
science-</p>
<p>based industry, fertilizer.</p>
<p>The conversion of the mechanical arts into a technology followed</p>
<p>he same sequence and a similar timetable. The hundred years
between</p>
<p>he 1714 offer of the famous 220,000 prize for a reliable
chronometer</p>
<p>and Eli Whitney’s standardization of parts was, of course, the
great</p>
<p>age of mechanical invention–of the machine tools, of the prime</p>
<p>movers, and of industrial organization. Technical training, though
not</p>
<p>yet in systematic form, began with the founding of the ~ c o l
edes</p>
<p>Pontes et Chausse’es in 1747. Codification and publication in
orga-</p>
<p>nized form goes back to Diderot’s Encyclope’die, the first volume
of</p>
<p>which appeared in 1750. In 1776-that miracle year that brought
the</p>
<p>Declaration of Independence, The Wealth of Nations, Blackstone’s</p>
<p>Commentaries, and Watt’s first practical steam engine-the first
mod-</p>
<p>ern technical university opened: the Bergakademie (Mining
Academy)</p>
<p>in Freiberg, Saxony. Significantly enough, one of the reasons for
its</p>
<p>establishment was the need for technically trained managers created
by</p>
<p>he increasing use of the Newcornen steam engine, especially in
deep-</p>
<p>level coal mining.</p>
<p>In 1794, with the establishment of the ~ c o l Polytechnique</p>
<p>e in Paris,</p>
<p>he profession of engineer was established. And again, within a
gener-</p>
<p>ation, we see a reorientation of the physical sciences–organic
chemis-</p>
<p>ry and electricity begin their scientific career, being
simultaneously</p>
<p>sciences and technologies. Liebig, Woehler, Faraday, Henry, Max-</p>
<p>well were great scientists whose work was quickly applied by
great</p>
<p>inventors, designers, and industrial developers.</p>
<p>Only medicine, of the major technologies, did not make the
transi-</p>
<p>ion in the eighteenth century. The attempt was made-by the Dutch-</p>
<p>man Gerhard van S ~ i e t e n not</p>
<p>, ~ only a great physician but politically</p>
<p>powerful as adviser to the Habsburg court. Van Swieten attempted
to</p>
<p>marry the clinical practice which his teacher Boerhaave had started
at</p>
<p>Leyden around 1700 with the new scientific methods of such men as</p>
<p>he Paduan Morgagni whose Pathological Anatomy (1761)9 first</p>
<p>reated diseases as afflictions of an organ rather than as
“humours“.</p>
<p>But-a lesson one should not forget-the very fact that medicine
(or</p>
<p>rather, something by that name) was already respectable and
organized</p>
<p>Technology, Science, and Culture 293</p>
<p>as an academic faculty defeated the attempt. Vienna relapsed into</p>
<p>medical scholasticism as soon as van Swieten and his backer, the</p>
<p>Emperor Joseph 11, died.</p>
<p>It was only after the French Revolution had abolished all medical</p>
<p>schools and medical societies that a real change could be
effected.</p>
<p>Then another court physician, Corvisart, Napoleon’s doctor,
accom-</p>
<p>plished, in Paris around 1820, what van Swieten had failed in.
Even</p>
<p>hen, opposition to the scientific approach remained powerful
enough</p>
<p>o drive Semmelweis out of Vienna and into exile when he found,</p>
<p>around 1840, that traditional medical practices were responsible
for</p>
<p>lying-in fever with its ghastly death toll. Not until 1850, with
the</p>
<p>emergence of the modern medical school in Paris, Vienna, and</p>
<p>Wuerzburg, did medicine become a genuine technology and an orga-</p>
<p>nized discipline.</p>
<p>This, too, happened, however, without benefit of science. What
was</p>
<p>codified and organized was primarily old knowledge, acquired in</p>
<p>practice. Immediately after the reorientation of the practice of
medi-</p>
<p>cine, the great medical scientists appeared-Claude Bernard,
Pasteur,</p>
<p>Lister, Koch. And they were all application-focused, all driven by
a</p>
<p>desire to do, rather than by a desire to know.</p>
<p>We know the results of the Technological Revolution, and its</p>
<p>impacts. We know that, contrary to Malthus, food supply in the
last</p>
<p>wo hundred years has risen a good deal more than an exploding</p>
<p>human population. We know that the average life span of man a</p>
<p>hundred and fifty years ago was still close to the “natural life
span“:</p>
<p>he twenty-five years or so needed for the physical reproduction of
the</p>
<p>species. In the most highly developed and prosperous areas, it
has</p>
<p>almost tripled. And we know the transformation of our lives
through</p>
<p>he mechanical technologies, their potential, and their dangers.</p>
<p>Most of us also know that the Technological Revolution has
resulted</p>
<p>in something even more unprecedented: a common world
civilization.</p>
<p>It is corroding and dissolving history, tradition, culture, and
values</p>
<p>hroughout the world, no matter how old, how highly developed, how</p>
<p>deeply cherished and loved.</p>
<p>And underlying this is a change in the meaning and nature of</p>
<p>knowledge and of our attitude to it. Perhaps one way of saying this
is</p>
<p>hat the non-Western world does not want Western science primarily</p>
<p>because it wants better understanding. It wants Western science
be-</p>
<p>cause it wants technology and its fruits. It wants control, not
under-</p>
<p>standing. The story of Japan’s Westernization between 1867 and
her</p>
<p>emergence as a modern nation in the Chinese War of 1894 is the</p>
<p>classical, as it is the earliest, example.1°</p>
<p>But this means that the Technological Revolution endowed technol-</p>
<p>ogy with a power which none of the “useful artsupwhether agri-</p>
<p>cultural, mechanical, or medical-had ever had before: impact on</p>
<p>man’s mind. Previously, the useful arts had to do only with how
man</p>
<p>lives and dies, how he works, plays, eats, and fights. How and what
he</p>
<p>hinks, how he sees the world and himself in it, his beliefs and
values,</p>
<p>lay elsewhere-in religion, in philosophy, in the arts, in science.
To</p>
<p>use technological means to affect these areas was traditionally</p>
<p>“magic7’-donsidered at least evil, if not asinine to boot.</p>
<p>With the Technological Revolution, however, application and cog-</p>
<p>nition, matter and the mind, tool and purpose, knowledge and
control</p>
<p>have come together for better or worse.</p>
<p>There is only one thing we do not know about the Technological</p>
<p>Revolution-but it is essential: what happened to bring about the
basic</p>
<p>change in attitudes, beliefs, and values which released it?
Scientific</p>
<p>progress, I have tried to show, had little to do with it. But how</p>
<p>responsible was the great change in world outlook which, a
century</p>
<p>earlier, had brought about the great Scientific Revolution? What
part</p>
<p>did the rising capitalism play? And what as the part of the new,</p>
<p>centralized national state with its mercantilistic policies on trade
and</p>
<p>industry and its bureaucratic obsession with written, systematic,
ratio-</p>
<p>nal procedures everywhere? (After all, the eighteenth century
codified</p>
<p>he laws as it codified the useful or applied arts.) Or do we have to
do</p>
<p>here with a process, the dynamics of which lie in technology? Is it
the</p>
<p>“progress of technology“ which piled up to the point when it
suddenly</p>
<p>urned things upside down, so that the “control“ which nature had</p>
<p>always exercised over man now became, at least potentially,
control</p>
<p>which man exercises over nature?</p>
<p>This should be, I submit, a central question both for the general</p>
<p>historian and for the historian of technology.</p>
<p>For the first, the Technological Revolution marks one of the
great</p>
<p>urning points-whether intellectually, politically, culturally, or
eco-</p>
<p>nomically. In all four areas the traditional-and always
unsuccessful-</p>
<p>Technology, Science, and Culture 295</p>
<p>drives of systems, powers, and religions for world domination are</p>
<p>replaced by a new and highly successful world-imperialism, that
of</p>
<p>echnology. Within a hundred years, it penetrates everywhere and</p>
<p>puts, by 1900, the symbol of its sovereignty, the steam engine,
even</p>
<p>into the Dalai Lama’s palace in Lhasa.</p>
<p>For the historian of technology, the Technological Revolution is
not</p>
<p>only the cataclysmic event within his chosen field; it is the point
at</p>
<p>which such a field as technology emerges. Up to that point there is,
of</p>
<p>course, a long and exciting history of crafts and tools, artifacts
and</p>
<p>mechanical ingenuity, slow, painful advances and sudden, rapid
diffu-</p>
<p>sion. But only the historian, endowed with hindsight, sees this
as</p>
<p>echnology, and as belonging together. To contemporaries, these
were</p>
<p>separate things, each belonging to its own sphere, application,
and</p>
<p>way of life.</p>
<p>Neither the general historian nor the historian of technology has
yet,</p>
<p>however, concerned himself much with the Technological
Revolution.</p>
<p>The first-if he sees it at all-dismisses technology as the bastard
child</p>
<p>of science. The only general historian of the first rank (excepting
only</p>
<p>hat keen connoisseur of techniques and tools, Herodotus) who
devotes</p>
<p>ime and attention to technology, its role and impact is, to my
knowl-</p>
<p>edge, Franz Schnabel.“ That Schnabel taught history at a
technical</p>
<p>university (Karlsruhe) may explain his interest. The historians
of</p>
<p>echnology, for their part, tend to be historians of materials, tools,
and</p>
<p>echniques rather than historians of technology. The rare
exceptions</p>
<p>end to be nontechnologists such as Lewis Mumford or Roger Bur-</p>
<p>lingame who, understandably, are concerned more with the impact
of</p>
<p>echnology on society and culture than with the development and</p>
<p>dynamics of technology itself.</p>
<p>Yet technology is important today precisely because it unites
both</p>
<p>he universe of doing and that of knowing, connects both the
intellec-</p>
<p>ual and the natural histories of man. How it came thus to be in
the</p>
<p>center-when it always before had been scattered around the
periph-</p>
<p>ery-has yet to be probed, thought through, and reported.</p>

<li>It was among the great Boerhaave’s many “firsts“ to have taught the
first course</li>
</ol>
<p>in ophthalmology and to examine actual eyes-in 1708 in Leyden.
Newton’s</p>
<p>Optics was the acknowledged inspiration. (See George Sarton, “The

<li>Bleeding actually reached a peak in the 1820s, when it was touted as
the universal</li>
</ol>
<p>remedy by no less an authority than Broussais, the most famous
professor at the</p>
<p>Paris Academy of Medicine. According to Henry E. Sigrist (Great
Doctors; Lon-</p>
<p>don: Allen and Unwin, 1933), it became so popular that in the one
year, 1827,</p>
<p>hirty-three million leeches were important into France.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>There was, to be sure, one famous dissent, one important and highly
effective</li>
</ol>
<p>approach to science as a means to doing and as a foundation for
technology. Its</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="atest">@atest</span> spokesman was
St. Bonaventura, the thirteenth-century antiphonist to St.</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas (see especially St. Bonaventura’s Reduction of all
Arts to</p>
<p>Theology). A hundred years earlier the dissenters actually dominated
in the</p>
<p>welfth-century Platonism of the theologian-technologist schools of
St. Victoire</p>
<p>and Chartres, builders alike of mysticism and of the great
cathedrals. On this see</p>
<p>Charles Homer Haskins, The Renaissance of the Twelfrh Century
(Cambridge,</p>
<p>Mass: Harvard University Press, 1927); Otto von Simson, The Gothic
Cathedral</p>
<p>(London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1956); and Abbot Suger on the
Abbey</p>
<p>Church of St. Denis and its Art Treasures, edited by Erwin Panofsky
(Princeton,</p>
<p>1946).</p>
<p>The dissenters did not, of course, see material technology as the end
of</p>
<p>knowledge; rational knowledge was a means towards the knowledge of
God or at</p>
<p>least His glorification. But knowledge, once its purpose was
application, imme-</p>
<p>diately focused on material technology and purely worldly ends-as
St. Bernard</p>
<p>pointed out in his famous attack on Suger’s ‘technocracy’ as early as
1127.</p>
<p>The dissent never died down completely. But after the Aristotelian
triumph of</p>
<p>he thirteenth century, it did not again become respectable, let alone
dominant</p>
<p>until the advent of Romantic Natural Philosophy in the early
nineteenth century,</p>
<p>well after the Technological Revolution and actually its first (and
so far only)</p>
<p>literary offspring. It is well known that there was the closest
connection between</p>
<p>he Romantics-with Novalis their greatest poet, and with Schelling
their official</p>
<p>philospher-and the first major discipline which, from its inception,
was always</p>
<p>both science and technology: organic chemistry. Less well known is
the fact that</p>
<p>he Romantic movement, its philosophers, writers, and statesmen came
largely</p>
<p>out of the first technical university, the Mining Academy in Freiberg
(Saxony) that</p>
<p>had been founded in 1776.</p>
