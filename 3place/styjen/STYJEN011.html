<h4 id="the-poverty-of-economic-theory">The Poverty of Economic
Theory</h4>
<p>What creates wealth? For the last 450 years, economists have
either</p>
<p>neglected the question, sought easy answers, or dismissed
previous</p>
<p>assessments. Nonetheless, we have something to learn from every</p>
<p>interpretation.</p>
<p>The first generation of economists, the mercantilists, said,
“Wealth</p>
<p>is purchasing power.“ Their goal was to increase monetary wealth</p>
<p>with an accumulation of bullion and a favorable trade balance.
Another</p>
<p>heory stated that wealth is not created by man, but by
nature-that</p>
<p>land creates wealth.</p>
<p>Yet another group of theorists related wealth to man. “Wealth,“</p>
<p>hey said, “is created by human labor.“ This tenet signaled the</p>
<p>beginning of economics as a discipline because it related wealth
to</p>
<p>something that man creates. And yet it was totally unsatisfactory.
It</p>
<p>could not be made to predict or analyze anything.</p>
<p>A little more than 100 years ago the field of economics split in
two.</p>
<p>The mainstream simply gave up the search for any answer to the</p>
<p>question of the creation of wealth, became purely analytical, and</p>
<p>stopped relating economics to the behavior of people. Economics
was</p>
<p>a discipline that governed the behavior of commodities.
Ironically,</p>
<p>analysis is a great strength of contemporary economics, but it
also</p>
<p>explains why the public at large is bored stiff by the field. It
has</p>
<p>nothing to say to them because it lacks a foundation in value.</p>
<p>First published in New Management, 1987.</p>
<p>Another Wrong Answer</p>
<p>Karl Marx understood this shortfall when he stuck with the labor</p>
<p>heory of value. “Marxist economics“ is a contradiction in
terms-it</p>
<p>has no analytical or predictive power-but it has a tremendous
appeal</p>
<p>precisely because it is grounded in a value. It defines the creators
of</p>
<p>wealth-human beings, labor. And yet, we know it’s the wrong</p>
<p>answer, too.</p>
<p>For the last 100 years, therefore, we have had a choice between
an</p>
<p>economics that has great analytical power but no foundation in
value</p>
<p>and an economics that wasn’t economics at all, but a political
manifest</p>
<p>based on the human being. Today we’ve finally reached a point
where</p>
<p>hat dilemma can be bridged, where we can begin to understand the</p>
<p>right approach, if not the right answer. We now know that the
source</p>
<p>of wealth is something specifically human: knowledge. If we apply</p>
<p>knowledge to tasks we already know how to do, we call it “produc-</p>
<p>ivity.“ If we apply knowledge to tasks that are new and different,
we</p>
<p>call it “innovation.“ Only knowledge allows us to achieve those
two</p>
<p>goals.</p>
<p>Tradition of Labor</p>
<p>This wasn’t always true. Two hundred years ago when Adam Smith</p>
<p>wrote about “the tradition of labor,“ his examples were people in</p>
<p>what is now central Germany, who, because of the heavy winters
with</p>
<p>lots of snow, learned to be woodworkers and make clocks and
violins.</p>
<p>It takes 200 years to build such a tradition, Smith said, except for
rare</p>
<p>cases when refugees or immigrants bring their skills to a
community.</p>
<p>Such was certainly the case when the U.S. won its independence.</p>
<p>Every American consul had an unlimited slush fund (which probably</p>
<p>meant 80) to bribe an English craftsman and supply him with false</p>
<p>papers to come to this country and teach us how to build textile</p>
<p>machinery and dye cotton. That’s how New England became an</p>
<p>industrial power around 1810.</p>
<p>During the nineteenth century, however, apprenticeship (a German</p>
<p>invention) telescoped the 200 years into five, and during the
twentieth</p>
<p>century, training (an American invention) telescoped five years
into</p>
<p>The Poverty of Economic Theory 97</p>
<p>six months or even ninety days. We invented training during World</p>
<p>War I because we had no tradition of labor. After World War 11,
our</p>
<p>invention spread worldwide, which is one reason why nations can
no</p>
<p>longer compete on the basis of a labor tradition.</p>
<p>Learning and Knowledge</p>
<p>Indeed, until recently, the quickest way for a person living in a</p>
<p>developed country to made a decent living was to become a semi-</p>
<p>skilled machine operator. After six weeks, he probably was better
paid</p>
<p>han associate professors, not to mention assistant deans. But
that’s</p>
<p>over. Today he can make a middle-class living only through
learning</p>
<p>and knowledge.</p>
<p>(Consider that thirty years ago, there was hardly a single person
in</p>
<p>Korea who had any tradition of skill or craft, if only because
Japan</p>
<p>didn’t allow its neighbors to acquire any for fifty years. Today,
Korea</p>
<p>can do almost anything any advanced industrial nation does, thanks
to</p>
<p>raining.)</p>
<p>Of course, the realization that knowledge is the source of wealth
has</p>
<p>major implications for economics, which today is at a dead end.</p>
<p>Economics used to be an enjoyable discipline because it was so</p>
<p>humble. When someone asked an economist of 1925 a question, his</p>
<p>answer was, “I don’t know,“ which in many ways is a respectable</p>
<p>answer. (At least it’s a modest one.) And then he said, “We don’t</p>
<p>know and therefore the intelligent thing to do is as little as
possible and</p>
<p>pray. Keep taxes low, expenditures low, and pray.“</p>
<p>New Philosophy</p>
<p>But my generation of economists became arrogant, largely as a</p>
<p>result of an incredible performance during World War I. In
military</p>
<p>erms, World War I is the all-time low of performance, but the
civilian</p>
<p>accomplishment was incredible. Every country was bankrupt by De-</p>
<p>cember 1914, and according to the traditional rules of the game,</p>
<p>should have had to stop fighting. But they kept on killing each
other</p>
<p>for four more years because the civilian administrators were so
incredi-</p>
<p>bly competent. and that competency corrupted and gave us
delusions</p>
<p>of grandeur.</p>
<p>When 1929 came along, suddenly there was a curious belief that</p>
<p>government should be able to do something about the economy. That</p>
<p>was totally unheard of in earlier days, but it became a popular
demand,</p>
<p>similar to the question, “If you can put a man on the moon, why
can’t</p>
<p>you do something about AIDS?“ And thus we saw the development of</p>
<p>economics that knew the answers.</p>
<p>Keynes knew the answer: Whatever ails you, just create more</p>
<p>purchasing power. Milton Friedman, who may be the last surviving</p>
<p>member of the great generation, refined it and said, “You don’t
even</p>
<p>have to do that. All you have to do is just make sure the money
supply</p>
<p>grows.“ For the supply-siders it was even easier: just cut taxes.
What</p>
<p>could appear nicer and more pleasant?</p>
<p>End of Euphoria</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century economics was known as the “dismal</p>
<p>science,“ because it always forced us to make choices, and we
always</p>
<p>had to forgo something. Suddenly it became a euphoric science.
For</p>
<p>fifty years, it’s been a euphoric science but believe me, that’s
over.</p>
<p>Economics hasn’t worked. Whatever we tried, it failed. What’s</p>
<p>more, the basic assumptions of modern economic theories are
unrea-</p>
<p>sonable and invalid. All of them assume that the sovereign state
is</p>
<p>alone in this world and can control its destiny. If the five or six
leading</p>
<p>industrial nations would simply agree to hand over their economic</p>
<p>policy to a czar, a commissioner, or a common organ, economic</p>
<p>heory would work. But chances are it won’t happen; by comparison,</p>
<p>winning a million dollars at a Las Vegas slot machine is a cinch.</p>
<p>Most economists have assumed, too, that the velocity of the turn-</p>
<p>over of money is a social habit and a constant-against all
evidence.</p>
<p>When the U.S. tested the theory for the first time in 1935 and
pumped</p>
<p>a lot of purchasing power into American pockets, we did not spend,
we</p>
<p>hoarded. The economy collapsed the following year, and it was
much</p>
<p>worse than in 1930 or 1931 because the American public sabotaged
the</p>
<p>economic policy. The same thing happened under Mr. Carter and Mr.</p>
<p>Reagan. The velocity of turnover of money is about as mercurial
as</p>
<p>eenage fashions and even less predictable.</p>
<p>The Poverty of Economic Theory 99</p>
<p>Invalid Theory</p>
<p>In essence, macroeconomic theory is no longer a basis for
economic</p>
<p>policy because no one knows what is going to happen. Mr. Reagan</p>
<p>came to power promising to cut the budget, but government
expenses</p>
<p>have never grown faster in the history of any country. He didn’t
betray</p>
<p>his trust; politically he had no choice. Political leaders have no
eco-</p>
<p>nomic theory they can trust, a fact which escapes many
businessmen.</p>
<p>The economics of tomorrow must do what economists have not been</p>
<p>able to do: integrate the realms of the domestic and the world.
(Note</p>
<p>he use of the word world rather than international. International</p>
<p>implies economies outside the domestic realm; world economies are</p>
<p>“inside. “)</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s economics must also answer the question: How do we</p>
<p>relate the way we run a business to results. What are results?
The</p>
<p>raditional answer-the bottom line-is treacherous. Under a bottom-</p>
<p>line philosophy, we cannot relate the short term to the long term,
and</p>
<p>yet the balance between the two is a crucial test of management.</p>
<p>Two Guideposts</p>
<p>The beacons of productivity and innovation must be our
guideposts.</p>
<p>If we achieve profits at the cost of downgrading productivity or
not</p>
<p>innovating, they aren’t profits. We’re destroying capital. On the
other</p>
<p>hand, it we continue to improve productivity of all key resources</p>
<p>and our innovative standing, we are going to be profitable. Not
today,</p>
<p>but tomorrow. In looking at knowledge applied to human work as</p>
<p>he source of wealth, we also see the function of the economic
organ-</p>
<p>ization.</p>
<p>For the first time we have an approach that makes economics a</p>
<p>human discipline and relates it to human values, a theory that gives
a</p>
<p>businessman a yardstick to measure whether he’s still moving in
the</p>
<p>right direction and whether his results a real or delusions. We are
on</p>
<p>he threshold of post-economic theory, grounded in what we now</p>
<p>know and understand about the generation of wealth.</p>
