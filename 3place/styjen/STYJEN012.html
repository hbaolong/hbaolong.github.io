<h4 id="the-delusion-of-profits">The Delusion of Profits</h4>
<p>Businessmen habitually complain about the economic illiteracy of</p>
<p>he public, and with good reason. The greatest threat to the free
enter-</p>
<p>prise system in this country is not the hostility to business of a
small,</p>
<p>strident group, but the pervasive ignorance throughout our society
in</p>
<p>respect to both the structure of the system and its functioning.</p>
<p>But the same businessmen who so loudly complain about economic</p>
<p>illiteracy are themselves the worst offenders. They don’t seem to
know</p>
<p>he first thing about profit and profitability. And what they say to
each</p>
<p>other as well as to the public inhibits both business action and
public</p>
<p>understanding.</p>
<p>For the essential fact about profit is that there is no such thing.
There</p>
<p>are only costs.</p>
<p>What is called “profit“ and reported as such in company accounts
is</p>
<p>genuine and largely quantifiable cost in three respects: as genuine
cost</p>
<p>of a major resource, namely capital; as a necessary insurance
premium</p>
<p>for the real-and again largely quantifiable-risks and uncertainties
of</p>
<p>all economic activity; and as cost of the jobs and pensions of
tomor-</p>
<p>row. The only exception, the only true surplus, is a genuine
monopoly</p>
<p>profit such as that now being extorted by the OPEC cartel in
petro-</p>
<p>leum.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All economists have known for two hundred years that there are</li>
</ol>
<p>factors of production, that is, three necessary resources: labor,
land</p>
<p>(i.e., physical resources), and capital. And all of us should
have</p>
<p>First published in the Wall Street Journal 1975</p>
<p>learned in the last ten years that there are no “free“ resources.
They all</p>
<p>have a cost. Indeed, the economists are way ahead of most
business-</p>
<p>men in their understanding and acceptance of a genuine “cost of</p>
<p>capital.“ Some of them, such as Ezra Solomon, a former member of</p>
<p>he Council of Economic Advisers now back at Stanford University,</p>
<p>have worked out elegant methods both for determining the cost of</p>
<p>capital and for measuring the performance of a business in earning
it.</p>
<p>We know that in the post-World War I1 period, until the onset of</p>
<p>global inflation in the mid-sixties, the cost of capital in all
developed</p>
<p>countries of the Free World ran somewhat above 10 percent a year (it
is</p>
<p>almost certainly much higher in communist economies). And we know</p>
<p>hat very few businesses actually earn enough to cover these
genuine</p>
<p>costs. But so far only a handful of businesses seem to know that
there</p>
<p>is such a cost. Fewer still seem to know whether they cover it or
not.</p>
<p>And even these few never talk about it and never in their
published</p>
<p>accounts subject their own performance to the test. Yet not to earn
the</p>
<p>cost of capital is as much a failure to cover costs as not to earn
the costs</p>
<p>of wages or of raw materials.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Economic activity is the commitment of existing resources to</li>
</ol>
<p>future expectations. It is a commitment, therefore, to risk and
uncer-</p>
<p>ainty-in respect to obsolescence of products, processes, and
equip-</p>
<p>ment; in respect to changes in markets, distributive channels,
and</p>
<p>consumer values; and in respect to changes in economy,
technology,</p>
<p>and society. The odds in any commitment to the future are always</p>
<p>adverse; it is not given to human beings to know the future. The
odds,</p>
<p>herefore, are always in favor of loss rather than gain. And in a
period</p>
<p>of rapid change such as ours, the risks and uncertainties are surely
not</p>
<p>getting smaller.</p>
<p>These risks and uncertainties are not capable of precise
determina-</p>
<p>ion. But the minimum of risk in these commitments to the future
is</p>
<p>capable of being determined, and indeed quantified, with a fair
degree</p>
<p>of probability. Where this has been attempted in any business-and
in</p>
<p>both Xerox and IBM, for instance, it is known to have been done
for</p>
<p>years in respect to products and technologies-the risks have proven
to</p>
<p>be much higher than even conservative “business plans“ assumed.</p>
<p>The risks of natural events-fire, for instance-have long been</p>
<p>reated as normal business costs. A business that failed to set aside
the</p>
<p>appropriate insurance premiums for such risks would rightly be
consid-</p>
<p>The Delusion of Profits 103</p>
<p>ered to be endangering the wealth producing assets in its
keeping.</p>
<p>Economic, technological, and social risks and uncertainties are no
less</p>
<p>real. They too require an adequate “insurance premiumw-and to</p>
<p>supply it is the function of profit and profitability.</p>
<p>Therefore, the proper question for any management is not “What is</p>
<p>he maximum profit this business can yield?“ It is “What is the</p>
<p>minimum profitability needed to cover the future risks of this
busi-</p>
<p>ness?“ And if the profitability falls short of this minimum-as it
does</p>
<p>in most companies I know-the business fails to cover genuine
costs,</p>
<p>endangers itself, and impoverishes the economy.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Profit is also tomorrow’s jobs and tomorrow’s pensions. Both
are</li>
</ol>
<p>costs of a business and, equally, costs of the economy. Profit is not
the</p>
<p>only source of capital formation; there is also private savings,
of</p>
<p>course. But business earnings, whether retained in the business or
paid</p>
<p>out (returned to the capital market), are the largest single source
of</p>
<p>capital formation for tomorrow’s jobs and, at least in the United
States,</p>
<p>he largest single source of capital formation for tomorrow’s
pensions.</p>
<p>The most satisfactory definition of “economic progress“ is a
steady</p>
<p>rise in the ability of an economy to invest more capital for each
new</p>
<p>job and thereby to produce jobs that yield a better living as well as
a</p>
<p>better quality of work and life. by 1965, before inflation made
mean-</p>
<p>ingful figures increasingly difficult to obtain, investment per job
in the</p>
<p>American economy had risen from 5,000 to 0,000. The require-</p>
<p>ment will go up fairly sharply, for the greatest investment needs
and</p>
<p>opportunities are in industries: energy, the environment,
transporta-</p>
<p>ion, health care, and, above all, increased food production, in
which</p>
<p>capital investment per job is far higher than the average in the
consum-</p>
<p>er goods industries, which have dominated the economy these last</p>
<p>wenty-five years.</p>
<p>At the same time, the number of jobs required is going up
sharply-</p>
<p>he aftermath of the “baby boom“ between 1948 and 1960. We will</p>
<p>have to increase the number of people at work by 1 percent, or almost
a</p>
<p>million people, each year until the early eighties to stay even with
the</p>
<p>demographics. At the same time, the number of people on pensions</p>
<p>will also increase, if only because workers reaching retirement age
will</p>
<p>live longer, and so will the income expectations of the pensioners.
Any</p>
<p>company which does not produce enough capital, i. e., enough
earn-</p>
<p>ings, to provide for this expansion in jobs and pensions fails both
to</p>
<p>cover its own predictable and quantifiable costs and the costs of
the</p>
<p>economy.</p>
<p>These three kinds of costs-the costs of capital, the risk premium
of</p>
<p>economic activity, and the capital needs of the future-overlap to
a</p>
<p>considerable extent. But any company should be expected to cover</p>
<p>adequately the largest of these three costs. Otherwise it operates at
a</p>
<p>genuine, certain, and provable loss.</p>
<p>There are three conclusions from these elementary premises:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Profit is not peculiar to capitalism. It is a prerequisite for
any</li>
</ol>
<p>economic system. Indeed, the communists economies require a much</p>
<p>higher rate of profit. Their costs of capital are higher. And
central</p>
<p>planning adds an additional and major economic uncertainty. In
fact,</p>
<p>he communist economies do operate at a substantially higher rate
of</p>
<p>profit than any market economy, no matter that for ideological
reasons</p>
<p>it is called “turnover tax“ rather than “profit.“ And the only
econ-</p>
<p>omies that can be considered as being based on profit planning
are</p>
<p>precisely communist economies in which the producer (state
planner)</p>
<p>imposes the needed profitability in advance rather than let
market</p>
<p>forces determine it.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The costs which are paid for out of the difference between
current</li>
</ol>
<p>revenues and current expenses of production and distribution are
fully</p>
<p>as much economic reality as wages or payments for supplies. Since
a</p>
<p>company’s accounts are supposed to reflect economic reality,
these</p>
<p>costs should be shown. They are, to be sure, not as precisely known
or</p>
<p>knowable as the accountants’ “costs of doing business“ supposedly</p>
<p>are. But they are known and knowable within limits that are
probably</p>
<p>no wider or fuzzier than those of most cost accounting or
depreciation</p>
<p>figures-and they may be more important both for managing a busi-</p>
<p>ness and for analyzing its performance. Indeed, it might not be a
bad</p>
<p>idea to tie executive bonuses and incentives to a company’s
perfor-</p>
<p>mance in earning adequately these genuine costs rather than to
profit</p>
<p>figures that often reflect financial leverage as much as actual
economic</p>
<p>performance.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Finally, businessmen owe it to themselves and owe it to society
to</li>
</ol>
<p>hammer home that there is no such thing as profit. There are only</p>
<p>costs: costs of doing business and costs of staying in business;
costs of</p>
<p>labor and raw materials, and costs of capital; costs of today’s jobs
and</p>
<p>costs of tomorrow’s jobs and tomorrow’s pensions.</p>
<p>The Delusion of Profits 105</p>
<p>There is no conflict between profit and social responsibility. To
earn</p>
<p>enough to cover the genuine costs, which only the so-called profit
can</p>
<p>cover, is economic and social responsibility-indeed it is the
specific</p>
<p>social and economic responsibility of business. It is not the
business</p>
<p>hat earns a profit adequate to its genuine costs of capital, to the
risks</p>
<p>of tomorrow and to the needs of tomorrow’s worker and pensioner,</p>
<p>hat “rips off“ society. It is the business that fails to do so.</p>
