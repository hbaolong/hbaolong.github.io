<h4 id="ibms-watson-vision-for-tomorrow">IBM’s Watson: Vision for
Tomorrow</h4>
<p>Everybody knows that Thomas Watson, Sr. (1874-1956), built IBM</p>
<p>into a big computer company and was a business leader. But
“every-</p>
<p>body“ is wrong. Thomas Watson, Sr., did not build the IBM we now</p>
<p>know; his son, Tom Watson, Jr., did this after he moved into the</p>
<p>company’s top management in 1946, only thirty-two years old
(though</p>
<p>he father stayed on until 1956 as a very active chairman). The
father’s</p>
<p>IBM was never more than medium-size; as late as 1938 it had only
5</p>
<p>million in sales. Of course, it did not make or sell computers;
its</p>
<p>mainstays were punch-card machines and time clocks.</p>
<p>Instead of being a business leader, Thomas Watson, Sr., did not</p>
<p>attain personal success and recognition until he was well past
sixty.</p>
<p>Twice in the 1930s he personally was on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>What saved him and spurred IBM sales during the Depression were</p>
<p>wo New Deal laws: the Social Security Act in 1935 and the Wage-</p>
<p>Hours Act of 1937-38. They mandated records of wages paid, hours</p>
<p>worked, and overtime earned by employees, in a form in which the</p>
<p>employer could not tamper with the records. Overnight they
created</p>
<p>markets for the tabulating machines and time clocks that Thomas</p>
<p>Watson, Sr., had been trying for long years to sell with only
moderate</p>
<p>success.</p>
<p>In 1939, when I was working in New York as a correspondent for a</p>
<p>group of British papers, I wanted to write a story on Watson and
IBM.</p>
<p>I had become interested in the company because of the big pavilion
it</p>
<p>First published in Esquire Magazine, 1983</p>
<p>had put up at the New York World’s Fair and thought a story on so</p>
<p>small a frog behaving like a big shot might be amusing. “Forget
it,“</p>
<p>my editor wrote back. “We are not interested in a story on an</p>
<p>unsuccessful company which as far as anyone can tell is never going
to</p>
<p>amount to much.“ And Watson was then already sixty-five years
old.</p>
<p>But Thomas Watson, Sr., was something far more important than a</p>
<p>successful businessman who built a big company. He was the seer
and,</p>
<p>very largely, the maker of what we now call postindustrial society
and</p>
<p>one of the great social innovators in American history. Fifty years
ago</p>
<p>he had the vision of “data processing“ and of “information.“ In
the</p>
<p>midst of the Depression and half broke himself, he financed the</p>
<p>research that produced both the theoretical foundations for the
comput-</p>
<p>er and the first highly advanced model of it.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago or more he also invented and put into practice
what</p>
<p>in this country is now known, studied, and imitated as Japanese</p>
<p>management-needless to say, he did so without the slightest
knowl-</p>
<p>edge of Japan and without owing anything to the then-nonexistent</p>
<p>Japanese practices.</p>
<p>In fact, Watson’s problem was that he was far ahead of his time,
in</p>
<p>his vision as well as in his practices.</p>
<p>I first met Watson in the early 1930s. He had been elected president
of</p>
<p>he American section of the International Chamber of Commerce-a</p>
<p>job nobody else had wanted-and I, then a very young reporter,
.was</p>
<p>sent to interview him. But the interview made absolutely no sense
to</p>
<p>my editor and never appeared. Of course, Watson delivered himself
of</p>
<p>he platitudes expected from the Chamber of Commerce, about free</p>
<p>rade, about international cooperation, and about “the role of the</p>
<p>businessman as an ambassador of peace.“ But then he started to talk
of</p>
<p>what clearly was his real interest-things he called data and
informa-</p>
<p>ion. But what he meant by those terms-it was not at all what
anyone</p>
<p>else at the time meant by them-he could not explain. Indeed,
news-</p>
<p>papers usually put him down as a crank.</p>
<p>I doubt that Watson himself understood. He had a vision-he saw.</p>
<p>But unlike most seers, Watson acted on his vision.</p>
<p>Some kind of computer would have come without him. There were a</p>
<p>good many people at the time working at fast calculating
machines,</p>
<p>IBM’s Watson: Vision for Tomorrow 49</p>
<p>especially under the impetus of World War 11, with its need for</p>
<p>navigational equipment for fast-moving airplanes, for firing
mecha-</p>
<p>nisms for long-range cannon shooting at invisible targets way
beyond</p>
<p>he horizon, for aerial bombs, and for antiaircraft guns. But
without</p>
<p>Watson it could have been a very different computer, a
“calculating</p>
<p>machine“ rather than an “information processor.“ Without Watson</p>
<p>and his vision the computer would have emerged as a “tool7’
rather</p>
<p>han as a “technology.“</p>
<p>Watson did not invent a single piece of hardware. He had no</p>
<p>echnical education, indeed little formal education altogether,
having</p>
<p>gone to work as a salesman of sewing machines, pianos, and organs
in</p>
<p>his native upstate New York when barely eighteen. He also had no</p>
<p>echnical talent, or much grasp of mathematics or of theory
altogether.</p>
<p>He was definitely not an inventor in the mold of Edison or his</p>
<p>contemporary Charles Kettering. The computers that he sponsored,</p>
<p>financed, and pushed for–one finished in 1943, another four years</p>
<p>later, in 1947-contributed little by way of hardware and
engineering</p>
<p>solutions even to IBM’s own early commercial computer in the
1950s.</p>
<p>But Watson saw and understood the computer fifteen years before</p>
<p>he term was even coined. He knew right away that it had to be</p>
<p>radically different from a high-speed calculator. And he did not
rest</p>
<p>until his engineers had built the first operational true
“computer.“</p>
<p>Watson specified very early-in the late 1930s at the latest-what</p>
<p>computer people now call the architecture of a computer: capacity
to</p>
<p>store data; a memory, and random access to it; ability to receive</p>
<p>instructions and to change them, to be programmed, and to express</p>
<p>logic in a computer language. Watson’s 1947 Selective Sequence</p>
<p>Electronic Calculator (SSEC) was much more powerful and far more</p>
<p>flexible than any machine then in existence or being planned. Its</p>
<p>12,500 vacuum tubes and 21,400 relays could, for instance, solve</p>
<p>partial differential equations. It was, above all, the first-and
for</p>
<p>several years the only-machine to combine electronic computation</p>
<p>with stored programs, with its own computer language, and with
the</p>
<p>capacity to handle its instructions as data: that is, to change, to
correct,</p>
<p>and to update them on the basis of new information. These are,</p>
<p>however, precisely the features that distinguish a computer from
a</p>
<p>calculator.</p>
<p>When IBM embarked on designing a computer to be sold in large</p>
<p>quantities, it applied hardware largely developed by
others-mainly</p>
<p>university labs at MIT, Princeton, Rochester, and Pennsylvania. But
it</p>
<p>was all designed to Watson’s original specifications. This
explains</p>
<p>why the 650, IBM’s first successful commercial machine,
immediately</p>
<p>became the industry leader and the industry standard when it was</p>
<p>introduced in 1953; why it sold eighteen hundred units during its
first</p>
<p>five years on the market-twice as many as the best market
research</p>
<p>had predicted total computer sales worldwide to come to in the
entire</p>
<p>wentieth century; and why it gave IBM the world leadership in</p>
<p>computers the company still holds.</p>
<p>The early technical history of the computer is quite murky. And</p>
<p>what part Watson and IBM, or anyone else, played in it is
remarkably</p>
<p>controversial. But there is no doubt at all that Watson played a key
role</p>
<p>in the conceptual history of the computer. There are many others
who</p>
<p>were important, if not central, in the engineering of the computer.
But</p>
<p>Watson created the computer age.</p>
<p>The story begins at 1933 when IBM, on Watson’s orders, designed a</p>
<p>high-speed calculator for Columbia University’s scientists and built
it</p>
<p>out of standard tabulating-machine parts. Four years later, in
1937,</p>
<p>Howard Aiken, a Harvard mathematician, suggested that IBM try to</p>
<p>link up several existing machines-designed originally for
bookkeep-</p>
<p>ing purposes-to create an even faster calculator for the
time-con-</p>
<p>suming and tedious computations needed by astronomers. The work,</p>
<p>Aiken estimated, would take a few months and would cost around</p>
<p>00,000. Instead, the work took six years and the cost was well
over</p>
<p>half a million dollars. For instead of the high-speed calculator
Aiken</p>
<p>had in mind, Watson went ahead and produced a computer.</p>
<p>First Watson specified an all-electronic machine; all earlier
designs,</p>
<p>including IBM’s own machines, were electromechanical with levers</p>
<p>and gears doing the switching. Of course, electronic then meant
using</p>
<p>vacuum tubes-the transistor was well into the future. And the
result-</p>
<p>ing machines were therefore big and clumsy, tended to overheat,
and</p>
<p>used a great deal of electricity. Still, no one at the time even knew
how</p>
<p>o use electronic devices as switches-the key, of course, to
computer</p>
<p>echnology. Even the needed theoretical work had yet to be done.
For</p>
<p>Watson and IBM to decide to desert the well-known and thoroughly</p>
<p>familiar electromechanical technology for the totally unexplored
elec-</p>
<p>ronics was a leap into the dark, but it was the decision that made
the</p>
<p>computer possible.</p>
<p>IBM’s Watson: Vision for Tomorrow 51</p>
<p>Watson’s second specification was equally innovative. His project</p>
<p>envisaged what no engineer at the time even dreamed of: a
computer</p>
<p>memory. Howard Aiken in his research proposal had been concerned</p>
<p>with rapid calculation; he wanted a “numbers-cruncher. “ His idea
was</p>
<p>o build something that would be able to do very quickly what
tradi-</p>
<p>ional adding machines and slide rules did slowly. IBM added to
this</p>
<p>he capacity to store data. And this meant that IBM’s projected
ma-</p>
<p>chine would be able to process information. It would have a data</p>
<p>bank-a term that, of course, did not exist at the time-and would
be</p>
<p>able to refer back to it. Thus it could memorize and analyze. It
could</p>
<p>also-and this is crucial+orrect and update its own instructions
on</p>
<p>he basis of new information.</p>
<p>And this then meant-another one of IBM’s then quite visionary</p>
<p>specifications-that IBM’s machine was going to be capable of
being</p>
<p>programmed, that is, of being used for any information capable of</p>
<p>being expressed in a logical notation. All the designs then being</p>
<p>worked on were for single-purpose machines. The best known of</p>
<p>hese, called ENIAC, constructed at the University of Pennsylvania</p>
<p>during the World War I1 years for Army Ordnance and completed in</p>
<p>1946, was, for instance, designed to do high-speed calculations
for</p>
<p>fast-firing guns. But it could do little more, as it had neither
memory</p>
<p>nor programming capacity. IBM, too, had specific applications in</p>
<p>mind-especially calculations for astronomical tables. But,
perhaps</p>
<p>because Watson knew firsthand of the data-processing needs of a
host</p>
<p>of institutions-public libraries, the Census Bureau, banks,
insurance</p>
<p>companies, and the like-his specifications called for a machine
capa-</p>
<p>ble of being programmed for all kinds of data. IBM’s machine was
a</p>
<p>multipurpose machine from the start. This, then, also meant that
when</p>
<p>IBM finally had a computer that could be manufactured and sold-in</p>
<p>he early 1950s-it was both willing and able to supply the users</p>
<p>whose demand actually created the computer industry, but of whom
no</p>
<p>one had even thought in the early stages of computer design:
business</p>
<p>people who wanted computers for such mundane, unscientific pur-</p>
<p>poses as payroll and inventory. Watson’s insistence on memory and</p>
<p>program thus explains in large measure why there is a computer</p>
<p>industry.</p>
<p>Because of Watson’s specifications of memory and program, the</p>
<p>IBM research project of 1937 helped create computer science. The</p>
<p>“analytical machine“ that Watson tried to develop needed both
com-</p>
<p>puter theory and computer language-again, of course, terms that
did</p>
<p>not exist then. It needed, of course, first-class engineering, as did
all</p>
<p>he other calculating machines then designed. But it also created, or
at</p>
<p>least stimulated, the first computer scientists.</p>
<p>This research produced a prototype in late 1943-called the Auto-</p>
<p>matic Sequence Controlled Calculator (ASCC)-and Howard Aiken</p>
<p>did do astronomical calculations on it, in early 1944. But it was far
too</p>
<p>advanced for the manufacturing technology of its time. In fact,
only</p>
<p>recently have the materials and the technology become available
to</p>
<p>manufacture the kind of computer for which Watson organized the</p>
<p>research in 1937. Watson then donated the prototype, together
with</p>
<p>money to run and maintain it, to Harvard and immediately commis-</p>
<p>sioned the work on the next design-the work out of which the SSEC</p>
<p>evolved several years later. Its first public demonstration, on
January</p>
<p>27, 1948, in New York City-at which it calculated all past,
present,</p>
<p>and future positions of the moon-ushered in the computer age.
Even</p>
<p>now, thirty-five years later, the computer that popular cartoons
show,</p>
<p>with its blinking lights and whirling wheels, is the SSEC as it
was</p>
<p>displayed at this first public demonstration. And looking at
Watson’s</p>
<p>specifications in retrospect, this is precisely what must have been
in his</p>
<p>mind’s eye all along.</p>
<p>As significant as Watson the computer seer is Watson the social</p>
<p>innovator. He was even further ahead in his social vision than he
was</p>
<p>in his vision of data and information and had perhaps even more of
an</p>
<p>impact-and was equally (or more) misunderstood by his contempo-</p>
<p>raries.</p>
<p>Watson became a national figure in 1940, when Fortune published a</p>
<p>violent, mudslinging attack on him. It insinuated that Watson was
the</p>
<p>American Fiihrer and tried altogether to make him the symbol of</p>
<p>everything repulsive in American capitalism. And it also fixed
the</p>
<p>popular perception of Thomas Watson as a reactionary and as a</p>
<p>paternalist, a perception that still lingers on. But today it is
clear that</p>
<p>Watson’s real offense was to be far ahead of his time.</p>
<p>Rereading the story in 1983, forty-three years later, I saw right
away</p>
<p>hat what had most irked the Fortune writer in 1940 was Watson’s
ban</p>
<p>on liquor in IBM’s employee clubs and at IBM parties. He was
indeed</p>
<p>passionately opposed to alcohol-I once heard that his father or one
of</p>
<p>IBM’s Watson: Vision for Tomorrow 53</p>
<p>his uncles had been an alcoholic. But whatever Watson’s reasons, it
is</p>
<p>perhaps not such a bad idea to keep work and liquor apart.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there was Watson’s regimentation of his sales</p>
<p>force, that is, his demand that IBM’s salesmen wear dark suits
and</p>
<p>white shirts. But what Watson tried to do, as he had explained to me
in</p>
<p>my interviews with him a year before the Fortune story, was to
instill</p>
<p>self-respect in salesmen and respect for them among the public.
When</p>
<p>Watson began, the salesman was a “drummer,“ disreputable and a</p>
<p>smelly crook, who spent his evenings in the small town’s
whorehouse</p>
<p>unless he spent it debauching the farmer’s innocent daughter in
the</p>
<p>hayloft. Watson, who had been a drummer himself, had deeply suf-</p>
<p>fered from the contempt for his calling and was determined that
his</p>
<p>associates have self-respect and be respected. “I want my IBM
sales-</p>
<p>men,“ he had said in his 1939 talks with me, “to be people to
whom</p>
<p>heir wives and their children can look up. I don’t want their mothers
to</p>
<p>feel that they have to apologize for them or have to dissimulate
when</p>
<p>hey are being asked what their son is doing“ (and there was a
clear</p>
<p>implication, I thought then, that he was speaking of his own
mother).</p>
<p>Watson’s heinous crime, however, and the one the Fortune writer</p>
<p>could not forgive him for, was that he believed in a worker who
took</p>
<p>responsibility for his job, was proud of it, and loved it. He
believed in</p>
<p>a worker who saw his interests as identical to those of the company.
He</p>
<p>wanted, above all, a worker who used his own mind and his own</p>
<p>experience to improve his own job, the product, the process, and
the</p>
<p>quality. Watson’s crime-and it was indeed seen as a crime in the
late</p>
<p>1930s, when a vulgar Marxism infested even fairly conservative
mem-</p>
<p>bers of the intelligentsia-was to make workers enjoy their work
and</p>
<p>hus accept the system rather than feel exploited and become
revolu-</p>
<p>ionary proletarians.</p>
<p>The way Watson did this was, first, to give his employees what we</p>
<p>now call lifetime employment. As in Japan today, there was no</p>
<p>contractual obligation on the part of Watson’s IBM not to lay off</p>
<p>people. But there was a moral commitment. In the first Depression</p>
<p>years, 1931 and 1932, IBM did indeed lay off a few people, but</p>
<p>Watson immediately stopped it. His refusal later, in the darkest
De-</p>
<p>pression years of 1933 and 1934, to lay off workers could have</p>
<p>bankrupted IBM. And employment security for workers has been IBM</p>
<p>practice for fifty years now.</p>
<p>In the mid-1930s Watson abolished “foremen. “ They became</p>
<p>“managers,“ whose job it was to assist workers, to make sure that</p>
<p>workers had the tools and the information they needed, and to
help</p>
<p>hem when they found themselves in trouble. Responsibility for the
job</p>
<p>itself was placed firmly on the work group.</p>
<p>The worker, Watson argued, knew far better than anyone else how</p>
<p>o improve productivity and quality. And so around 1935 he
invented</p>
<p>what we now know as quality circles and credit to the Japanese.
The</p>
<p>industrial engineer was to be a “resource“ to the work group and
its</p>
<p>“consultant,“ rather than the “expert“ who dictated to it. Watson
also</p>
<p>laid down that the individual worker should have the biggest job</p>
<p>possible rather than the smallest one, and as far back as 1920 he</p>
<p>initiated what we now call job enrichment. (And after the old
man’s</p>
<p>death his son, in 1958, put into effect his father’s old idea and put
all</p>
<p>employees on a monthly salary, abolishing both the hourly wage
and</p>
<p>he distinction between blue-collar and white-collar employees.)</p>
<p>Finally, every employee at IBM had the right to go directly to
the</p>
<p>company’s chief executive officer, that is, to Watson, to complain,
to</p>
<p>suggest improvements, and to be heard-and this is still IBM
practice.</p>
<p>Much earlier Watson had invented what the Japanese now call</p>
<p>continuous learning. He began in the early 1920s with his
salespeople,</p>
<p>who were called into headquarters again and again for training
sessions</p>
<p>,to enable them to “do better what they are already doing well.“
Later</p>
<p>Watson extended continuous learning to the blue-collar employees
in</p>
<p>he plant, and in the 1940s he hired Dwayne Orton, a college
president</p>
<p>from San Francisco, to be the company’s director of education.</p>
<p>These practices very largely explain IBM’s success. They
exorcised</p>
<p>he great bugaboo of American business, the employees’ alleged re-</p>
<p>sistance to change. They enabled the company in the 1950s and
1960s</p>
<p>o grow as fast as any business had ever grown before-and perhaps</p>
<p>faster-without much internal turbulence, without horrendous labor</p>
<p>urnover, and without industrial strife. And because Watson’s
sales-</p>
<p>men had all along been used to learning new things, middle-aged</p>
<p>punch-card salesmen without experience in computers or in
big-com-</p>
<p>pany management could overnight become effective executives in a</p>
<p>big high-technology company.</p>
<p>But forty years ago Watson’s policies and practices were very</p>
<p>strange indeed. They either made Watson look like a crank, which
is</p>
<p>what most people believed, or they made him into the sinister force
the</p>
<p>IBM’s Watson: Vision for Tomorrow 55</p>
<p>Fortune writer saw. Today we realize that Watson was only forty
or</p>
<p>fifty years ahead of his time. Watson was actually one year older
than</p>
<p>Alfred Sloan. But whereas Sloan in the 1920s created modern
manage-</p>
<p>ment by building General Motors, and with it the modern “big
corpo-</p>
<p>ration,“ Watson ten years later and quite independently created
the</p>
<p>“plant community“ that we know to be the successor to Sloan’s
“big</p>
<p>business enterprise“ of the 1920s. He created in the 1930s the
social</p>
<p>organization and the work community of the postindustrial
society.</p>
<p>The first ones to see this, by the way, were the Japanese. Again
and</p>
<p>again I have been laughed at in Japan when I talk about Japan’s</p>
<p>management embodying Japanese values. “Don’t you realize,“ my</p>
<p>Japanese friends ask, “that we are simply adapting what IBM has
done</p>
<p>all along?“ And when I ask how come, they always say, “When we</p>
<p>started to rebuild Japan in the 1950s, we looked around for the
most</p>
<p>successful company we could find-it’s IBM, isn’t it?“</p>
<p>Watson also anticipated the multinational. And this, too, no one
in</p>
<p>1940 could understand.</p>
<p>Watson very early established foreign branches of IBM, one in</p>
<p>France, one in Japan, and so on. IBM actually had little foreign</p>
<p>business at the time, and Watson knew perfectly well that he
could</p>
<p>have handled whatever there was through exporting directly. But
he</p>
<p>also realized that the IBM he envisaged for the future, the IBM of
what</p>
<p>we now call data processing and information handling, would have
to</p>
<p>be a multinational company. And so he created, more than fifty
years</p>
<p>ago, the structure he knew IBM would have to have and would have
to</p>
<p>know how to manage were it ever to become the company he dreamed</p>
<p>of. He also saw that the central problem of the multinational is
to</p>
<p>combine autonomy of the local affiliate with unity of direction
and</p>
<p>purpose of the entire company. This is in large measure the reason
that</p>
<p>Watson deliberately created what to most people seemed such
extreme</p>
<p>paternalism-today we would call it the IBM culture. Way back in</p>
<p>1939 he tried to explain it to me. “Foreign affiliates,“ he said,</p>
<p>must be run by natives of their own country and not by expatriates.
They must be</p>
<p>accepted as members of their own society. And they must be able to
attract the best</p>
<p>people their own country produces. Yet they have to have the same
objectives, the</p>
<p>same values, the same vision of the world as the parent company. And
this means</p>
<p>hat their management people and their professional people share a
common view</p>
<p>of the company, of the products, and of their own direction and
purpose.</p>
<p>Most other multinationals still struggle with the problem Watson</p>
<p>foresaw-and solved-fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Watson was an autocrat, of course. Visionaries usually are.
Because</p>
<p>visionaries cannot explain to the rest of us what they see, they have
to</p>
<p>depend on command.</p>
<p>Watson was a generous person but a demanding boss and not one bit</p>
<p>permissive. But he demanded the right things: dedication and
perfor-</p>
<p>mance to high standards. He was irascible, vain, opinionated, a
public-</p>
<p>ity hound, and an incorrigible name-dropper. And as he grew older
he</p>
<p>became interestingly addicted to being grossly flattered. But he
was</p>
<p>also intensely loyal and quite willing to admit that he had been
wrong</p>
<p>and to apologize. The people who worked for him feared him-but</p>
<p>almost no one left.</p>
<p>Of course, he did not fit into the intellectual climate of the
New</p>
<p>York of the late 1930s. He was already sixty-five at that time and
his</p>
<p>roots were in the small rural towns of the 1880s, with their
church</p>
<p>socials and their service-club luncheons, with communal singing
and</p>
<p>pledges of allegiance to the flag-all the things that the “smart set“
of</p>
<p>he time had learned to sneer at as the marks of the “booboisie.“
And</p>
<p>what was worse and made Watson a menace was that his employees</p>
<p>shared Watson’s values, rather than those of the intellectuals,
and</p>
<p>loved to work for him.</p>
<p>Watson was an extraordinarily complex man who fit into no catego-</p>
<p>ry. He was among the first American businessmen to use modern</p>
<p>design and modern graphics for the company logo and company</p>
<p>stationery, products, and offices. But he did so mainly because it
was</p>
<p>he cheapest way to make his company stand out-and he had no</p>
<p>advertising money. To get attention for IBM he used the slogan
THINK,</p>
<p>which he had invented at NCR. His salesmen used THINK notebooks
by</p>
<p>he thousands-again, it was the only advertising he could afford.
And</p>
<p>although he himself didn’t have much of a sense of humor, he made
up</p>
<p>a good many of the THINK jokes and saw to it that they got wide</p>
<p>circulation-again, to get attention for his company. Finally he
hit</p>
<p>upon the brilliant idea of building a huge pavilion at the 1939
New</p>
<p>York World’s Fair as the only way to make millions of visitors from
all</p>
<p>IBM’s Watson: Vision for Tomorrow 57</p>
<p>over the world aware of his then still small and practically
unknown</p>
<p>company and, as he told me at the time, “at the lowest cost per</p>
<p>housand viewers anyone ever had to pay.“</p>
<p>Watson’s popular image is that of the hidebound conservative, and</p>
<p>he lent credence to this view by wearing the stiff Herbert Hoover
collar</p>
<p>long after it had gone out of fashion. But, almost alone among
the</p>
<p>businessmen of his time, he was an ardent New Dealer and a
staunch</p>
<p>supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Indeed, FDR offered him major</p>
<p>posts in his administration: first secretary of commerce, and
then</p>
<p>ambassador to Great Britain (when Watson said no, the job went to</p>
<p>Joseph Kennedy instead). And at the very end of his life Watson
urged</p>
<p>President Eisenhower to return to New Deal principles and was
upset</p>
<p>over Ike’s insistence on reducing the government’s role in
economy</p>
<p>and society.</p>
<p>Watson had a most unusual personal history, perhaps the most
unusual</p>
<p>one in the annals of American business. He started out dirt poor as
a</p>
<p>eenage drummer-not much more than a peddler. He rose to become</p>
<p>he star salesman for the then-new National Cash Register Company
of</p>
<p>Dayton, Ohio, which was the first business-machine company in</p>
<p>history. In about fifteen years he had become the company’s sales</p>
<p>manager. But then the company was indicted for antitrust
violations,</p>
<p>with which, we now know, Watson had little or nothing to do.</p>
<p>The trial was a sensation, for National Cash had been the growth</p>
<p>company of the early 1900s. Watson drew a stiff fine and a
one-year</p>
<p>jail sentence. This conviction was set aside two years later, in
1915, by</p>
<p>he Court of Appeals, and the government then dropped the case.
But</p>
<p>Watson had lost his job; both his career and his reputation were
in</p>
<p>atters. It was an experience that marked him for life, an
experience</p>
<p>hat he never forgot.</p>
<p>Already forty, he then had to begin all over again as general</p>
<p>manager for a small and until then quite unsuccessful company
that</p>
<p>owned the punch-card patents. It was not until he was past sixty, in
the</p>
<p>mid- 1930s, that he succeeded in establishing this company, by
then</p>
<p>renamed IBM, on a firm footing.</p>
<p>Watson-and this, I think, makes the man singularly
interesting-was</p>
<p>a uniquely American type and one the establishment has never
under-</p>
<p>stood throughout our history. He was possessed of a towering
intellect</p>
<p>but was totally nonintellectual. He belongs to the same type as
Abra-</p>
<p>ham Lincoln, who similarly offended the establishment of his day,
the</p>
<p>cosmopolitan, polished, learned Bostonians who considered them-</p>
<p>selves so superior to the yokel president in whose cabinet they
were</p>
<p>forced to serve. He was also similar in many ways to America’s
first</p>
<p>great novelist, James Fenimore Cooper, who was also sneered at,</p>
<p>despised, and pilloried by the intellectuals and the establishment of
his</p>
<p>ime, such as the New England Transcendentalists. They could not</p>
<p>make sense of the powerful, tragic, and prophetic vision in which</p>
<p>Cooper foretold the end of the American Dream in such books as
The</p>
<p>Pioneers and The Prairie.</p>
<p>This American type is totally native and owes nothing to Europe-</p>
<p>which is one reason that the intellectuals of his time do not know
what</p>
<p>o do with him. Typically the men of this type have a gift for
words-</p>
<p>and Watson fully shared it. But they are not men of ideas. They
are</p>
<p>men of vision. What makes them important is that, like Watson,
they</p>
<p>act on their vision.</p>
