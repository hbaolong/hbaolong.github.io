<h4 id="how-westernized-are-the-japanese">How Westernized Are the
Japanese?</h4>
<p>“I DETEST the nepotism that pervades Japanese academic live,“</p>
<p>says the distinguished historian. “Young scholars should make
their</p>
<p>careers on their merits and not on their family ties. That’s why
I</p>
<p>married my four daughters to the ablest and brightest of my
doctoral</p>
<p>students. This way I could do what Japanese tradition expects and</p>
<p>place my sons-in-law into the best of professorships-and I could do
it</p>
<p>with a good conscience for I know they deserve it.“</p>
<p>“We are completely Western in this outfit,“ says the successful</p>
<p>independent movie producer in his modernistic Tokyo studio. “We</p>
<p>even have a woman vice president in charge of finance and
administra-</p>
<p>ion. But, Professor Drucker, could you act as her go-between and
find</p>
<p>a husband for her in the United States? She is thirty now and should
be</p>
<p>married soon. “</p>
<p>“It would be wonderful if you’d find an American husband for me</p>
<p>and arrange the marriage,“ chimes in the attractive woman VP. “No</p>
<p>Japanese will marry a women’s libber like myself, who is a
profession-</p>
<p>al and executive.“ “Does it have to be an arranged marriage?“ I
ask.</p>
<p>“Definitely,“ answers the women’s libber, “the other way is much</p>
<p>oo risky.“</p>
<p>“Young Ohira will be the chief executive of this company in ten
to</p>
<p>fifteen years,“ I had been told repeatedly by the chairman of one of
the</p>
<p>leading high-technology firms. But when I inquire about Ohira on
my</p>
<p>latest Japanese trip, there is embarrassed silence. “We had to let
him</p>
<p>Published first in The Wall Street Journal, 1980</p>
<p>go,“ the chairman says. “He is an oldest son and his father, who
owns</p>
<p>a small wholesale business in Kobe, demanded that he take over
the</p>
<p>family company. We tried to talk the old man out of it, but he is</p>
<p>stubborn and so we had to let Ohira go.“</p>
<p>“Did he want to leave?“ I ask. “Of course not, but he had no</p>
<p>choice. He could never have been promoted if he had stayed.
Execu-</p>
<p>ives, after all, have to set an example-and in Japan an oldest son
is</p>
<p>still expected to follow his father in his business.“</p>
<p>The young woman who interpreted for me at a press conference asks</p>
<p>whether she and her biochemist husband might come and get my</p>
<p>advice. Their problem? Interpreters are very well paid and so the</p>
<p>young woman makes more than her husband, who, under Japanese</p>
<p>seniority rules, won’t be a full professor for six more years. Then
their</p>
<p>positions will be reversed. He’ll make about three times what he
makes</p>
<p>now; and she plans to take time out to have children. But in the</p>
<p>meantime both his and her family disapprove and nag.</p>
<p>“Does it bother you that the wife has the larger income?“ I ask.</p>
<p>“Not in the least,“ they both answer. “Then why do you have to
tell</p>
<p>your families?“ I say. They beam, tell me I’ve saved their
marriage,</p>
<p>and thank me profusely. “Did you really need me to tell you that?“
I</p>
<p>ask. “Of course not,“ they say, “but this is Japan; to do
anything</p>
<p>unconventional you have to have a sensei [master] tell you so-and
we</p>
<p>were pretty sure what you’d tell us when we came for your
advice.“</p>
<p>There is thus a good deal to support the “old Japan hands“ in
their</p>
<p>contention that the Japanese are Westernized “from nine to five“</p>
<p>only. It is certainly a much safer assumption in dealing with
Japanese</p>
<p>han the advice I heard a Swiss banker give to his successor as
the</p>
<p>bank’s representative in Tokyo: “Treat them as if they were
American</p>
<p>MBAs with German-sized attach6 cases,“ let alone the wondrous</p>
<p>description by a group of European Common Market economists that</p>
<p>is quoted up and down Japan with mixed amusement and indignation:</p>
<p>“The Japanese are economic animals who live in rabbit hutches.“</p>
<p>“For twenty years,“ says an experienced executive recruiter, “I</p>
<p>have placed Japanese executives with Western companies. The firms</p>
<p>hat have been successful in attracting and holding truly able
Japanese</p>
<p>are the ones who know that they’ll behave like Japanese no matter
how</p>
<p>impeccable their English or how much they prefer whiskey to
sake.“</p>
<p>Indeed the Japanese–except “from nine to five“-may well have</p>
<p>How Westernized Are the Japanese? 419</p>
<p>become more “Japanese“ and less “Western“ these last few years.</p>
<p>Ten or fifteen years ago, for instance, performances of the
Noh-the</p>
<p>raditional and stylized dance-opera-played to empty houses, with
the</p>
<p>few spectators mainly elderly men who came in, one suspected,</p>
<p>because the place was air-conditioned. When I went to a Noh
perfor-</p>
<p>mance in June of 1980 it was sold out, with every seat taken, mostly
by</p>
<p>professionals or young executives by their looks.</p>
<p>But things are rarely that simple-and never in Japan. Consider,
for</p>
<p>instance:</p>
<p>The twenty-year-old daughter of old friends-we have known her</p>
<p>since she was a toddler-tells us that she is majoring in
philosophy.</p>
<p>“Last term I took a nifty seminar reading Plato,“ she says. “Do
you</p>
<p>have good translations of Plato into Japanese?“ I ask. “We don’t
read</p>
<p>ranslations,“ she answers, quite indignant. “We read Plato in
Greek.</p>
<p>And this term we are reading Kant and Schopenhauer, in German.
And</p>
<p>I am also taking a very interesting course in Whitehead, Russell,</p>
<p>Wittgenstein, and Symbolic Logic, in English, of course.“</p>
<p>“And what are you doing for fun?“ I ask. “But this is the fun,“
she</p>
<p>answers. “Of course I also have to prepare myself for a job and
for</p>
<p>earning a living, and so I am doing judo. I got the Black Belt
eighteen</p>
<p>months ago and am now studying for the instructor’s exam. I am</p>
<p>already adviser to the judo club at my university and hope the
univer-</p>
<p>sity will hire me as a judo teacher when I graduate next year.
Don’t</p>
<p>smirk,“ she cries. “I am in dead earnest. Japanese girls are now</p>
<p>studying medicine and accounting and even engineering. But these
are</p>
<p>all imports from the West. To be accepted as equals our women
will</p>
<p>have to make it in something purely Japanese-and what could be</p>
<p>more Japanese than judo?“</p>
<p>Miyeko, whom we first knew as a college sophomore who inter-</p>
<p>preted for us on a hiking and camping trip, visits us with her
six-year-</p>
<p>old daughter and her husband, a middle-level executive in a big
trading</p>
<p>company. She confides that they both very much want to have
another</p>
<p>child but have decided against it.</p>
<p>“It might be a boy and, of course, that’s what we’d hope for,“</p>
<p>Miyeko says. “And then the firm would not send us overseas or
would</p>
<p>demand that I stay in Japan with the children and send him alone.
You</p>
<p>know that a Japanese boy has to grow up in Japan ever to be
accepted</p>
<p>as a Japanese. And my husband is in line, just now, for New York
or</p>
<p>Los Angeles.“ “Why do you want so badly to go abroad?“ I ask.</p>
<p>“Are the career opportunities better?“</p>
<p>“On the contrary,“ answers her husband. “If I stay in the home</p>
<p>office I have a good chance to be in top management in ten years; if
I</p>
<p>go overseas 1’11 be tagged as a foreign specialist and never make it.
But</p>
<p>hat’s a cheap price to pay for the freedom one has outside of Japan.
I</p>
<p>can’t tell you how much Miyeko and I enjoyed the seven years I
was</p>
<p>posted to Dusseldorf when we could go together in the evening to</p>
<p>concerts or to the theater and could go hiking and camping on
week-</p>
<p>ends. Now Japanese convention demands that we live with Miyeko’s</p>
<p>parents and they expect us to look after them on weekends. And I</p>
<p>never see my wife and daughter. I have to sit and drink in a Ginza
bar</p>
<p>every night till eleven during the week, either with my bosses or
with</p>
<p>my subordinates. You can’t imagine how sick and tired Miyeko and
I</p>
<p>are of all this never-ending Japanese togetherness. And all my
col-</p>
<p>leagues who have served overseas feel the same way.“</p>
<p>There is a revival under way of the old and charming Japanese</p>
<p>custom of having one really good and expensive piece of art serve
as</p>
<p>he sole decoration of the small and bare Japanese apartment. But
what</p>
<p>he young couples now buy when they start out in their own home is</p>
<p>rarely Japanese art; they buy a Picasso etching or pre-Colombian</p>
<p>pottery from Mexico or Peru, or a miniature from Moghul India, or
a</p>
<p>erra-cotta figurine supposedly found in an Etruscan tomb.</p>
<p>When, on a hot June Sunday, I made my way through a traffic jam</p>
<p>of strollers on the beaches south of Tokyo, there were, it seemed,
the</p>
<p>same young families-father, mother, and two children-that had</p>
<p>been there twenty years earlier. Twenty years ago the father
strode</p>
<p>ahead, carrying nothing; the mother followed, dragging one
infant,</p>
<p>carrying the other, and weighted down with paraphernalia. Now it
was</p>
<p>he young woman who walked ahead holding the older child by the</p>
<p>hand, with the husband following, carrying the baby, the portable
TV,</p>
<p>he ice bucket, the sand pails and spades, the lunch boxes, the
bal-</p>
<p>loons, and the blow-up animals. Up and down the beach road,
cutting</p>
<p>in and out of the stalled traffic, roared young men on
motorcycles</p>
<p>picking up single girls. But lo and behold, there suddenly appeared
a</p>
<p>brigade of young women on motorbikes looking for young men to
pick</p>
<p>UP.</p>
<p>According to Japanese folklore one is reborn on one’s sixtieth</p>
<p>How Westernized Are the Japanese? 421</p>
<p>birthday and starts life all over again as a baby. What then did
the</p>
<p>Empress of Japan choose as most appropriate to this uniquely
Japanese</p>
<p>radition when he picked a gift for her husband, the Emperor, on
his</p>
<p>eightieth (i.e., second twentieth) birthday last spring: an electric
razor!</p>
