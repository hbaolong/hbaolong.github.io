<h4 id="keynes-economics-as-a-magical-system">Keynes: Economics as a
Magical System</h4>
<p>The influence and reputation of John Maynard Keynes are not</p>
<p>explained by his having been a great economist, nor did his
importance</p>
<p>lie primarily in his economic theories. He was, indeed, a very
great</p>
<p>economist, in all likelihood the last of the “pure“ economists of
the</p>
<p>classical school, at once the legitimate heir and the liquidator of
Adam</p>
<p>Smith. But he was, above all, the representative political thinker of
the</p>
<p>interwar period; he expressed perfectly its attempt to master what
it</p>
<p>knew to be a new world by pretending that it was the old one.
Keynes’s</p>
<p>work was built on the realization that the fundamental assumptions
of</p>
<p>nineteenth-century laissez-faire economics no longer hold true in
an</p>
<p>industrial society and a credit economy. But it aimed at the
restoration</p>
<p>and preservation of the basic beliefs, the basic institutions of</p>
<p>nineteenth-century laissez-faire politics; above all, it aimed at
the</p>
<p>preservation of the autonomy and automatism of the market. The
two</p>
<p>could no longer be brought together in a rational system;
Keynes’s</p>
<p>policies are magic-spells, formulae, and incantations, to make
the</p>
<p>admittedly irrational behave rationally.</p>
<p>Keynes’s theoretical analysis of the new social and economic
reality</p>
<p>is a masterpiece that will endure. His conclusions from this
analysis</p>
<p>proved wrong, however; the economic policies which gave him his</p>
<p>reputation and influence have failed. When he died in the spring
of</p>
<p>1946 he was apparently at the peak of success and power: the
chief</p>
<p>financial adviser of his government’, a peer of the realm, the
almost</p>
<p>First published in Virginia Quarterly Review, shortly after Keynes’s
death, 1946.</p>
<p>undisputed master of the schools, especially in this country. But
his</p>
<p>very disciples, while using Keynesian terms, methods, and tools,
were</p>
<p>actually abandoning fast both his economic policies and his aim.</p>
<p>Keynes, who could write prose of a rare lucidity if he wanted to,</p>
<p>chose to present his theories in the most technical and most
jargon-</p>
<p>ridden language, but his central ideas are quite simple.</p>
<p>Classical economics knew neither money nor time as factors in the</p>
<p>economics process. Money was the “universal commodity, “ the sym-</p>
<p>bol of all other commodities, but without any life or effect of its
own.</p>
<p>It was convenient and necessary, but only an accounting unit to
keep</p>
<p>rack of what went on in the economy of “real“ goods and “real“</p>
<p>labor; price was simply the rate at which one commodity could be</p>
<p>exchanged against all others. The money of classical economics is
very</p>
<p>much like the ether of classical physics: it pervades all and carries
all,</p>
<p>but it has neither properties nor effects of its own. And the
classical</p>
<p>economist was also very much like the physicist of his age in his</p>
<p>concept of time: while everything happens in time, time itself is not
a</p>
<p>factor in the events themselves. This is no accident; classical
econom-</p>
<p>ics were patterned consciously on the model of Newtonian physics,
in</p>
<p>structure as well as in its basic assumption of a mechanical and
static</p>
<p>economic universe.</p>
<p>Keynesian theory is based on the assertion, axiomatic in an
indus-</p>
<p>rial age, that the economic process is not only in time but
largely</p>
<p>determined by time and that the economic expression of the time
factor</p>
<p>is money. To the classical economist, money was the shadow of</p>
<p>existing goods. Actually money, especially the bank deposits
which</p>
<p>are the money of a credit economy, is created and comes into being
in</p>
<p>anticipation of goods to be produced, of work to be performed.
This</p>
<p>means that money is not determined mechanically and according to</p>
<p>economic rationality, but psychologically and socially on the basis
of</p>
<p>confidence in the future. Time thus enters into every economic
transac-</p>
<p>ion in the form of fixed money obligations for the investments of
the</p>
<p>past on which the present is based. These money obligations for
the</p>
<p>past actually are the largest factor in the economic transactions
of</p>
<p>every member of an industrial society; for the cost of everything
we</p>
<p>Keynes: Economics as a Magical System 121</p>
<p>use, whether a house, a loaf of bread, or a hired man’s labor, is
made</p>
<p>up very largely of the money obligations for the past. Money,
instead</p>
<p>of being an inert and propertyless expression of economic
transactions,</p>
<p>influences, molds, and directs economic life; changes in the
money</p>
<p>sphere cause changes in the “real“ economy. We live at the same
time</p>
<p>in two closely interwoven but distinct economic systems: the
“real“</p>
<p>economy of the classics-an economy of goods, services, and labor,</p>
<p>existing in the present and determined mechanically; and the
“sym-</p>
<p>bol“ economy of money, heavy with the obligations of the past and</p>
<p>determined psychologically by our confidence in the future.</p>
<p>It is no belittling of Keynes to say that these insights did not
origi-</p>
<p>nate with him, but were the work of a whole generation of
economic</p>
<p>hinkers before him, especially of his two countrymen Hawtrey and</p>
<p>Withers, of the Swedes Cassel and Wicksell, and of the German</p>
<p>Knapp. But Keynes synthesized their isolated observations and</p>
<p>houghts into one system and developed a theory of the dynamics of</p>
<p>he economic process from them; and it is this theory we usually
mean</p>
<p>when we talk of “Keynesian economics.“ The assumptions of the</p>
<p>classics had made it virtually impossible for them to understand how
a</p>
<p>depression could ever happen except as a result of physical
catastro-</p>
<p>phes such as an earthquake or the destruction of war. Also, they
were</p>
<p>entirely unable to explain how a depression could last; if only left
alone</p>
<p>it had to correct itself. With the new understanding of the autonomy
of</p>
<p>he monetary sphere as his starting point, Keynes could give the
first</p>
<p>adequate theoretical explanation of the vital phenomena of
depression</p>
<p>and unemployment.</p>
<p>The first answer was Keynes’s most famous theory-the theory of</p>
<p>oversaving. Any saving is by definition a surplus of productive</p>
<p>resources-goods, labor, equipment–over current consumption. For</p>
<p>he classics that meant that, unless physically destroyed, any
saving</p>
<p>must automatically be “invested,“ that is, used for future
production.</p>
<p>This, however, ceases to be true as soon as we bring in money as</p>
<p>autonomous, as having an economic reality of its own. Then it be-</p>
<p>comes possible for savings not to be invested but to become mere</p>
<p>money savings, with the productive resources they represent left
un-</p>
<p>used and unemployed. Keynes asserted that the modern economy has</p>
<p>an inherent tendency toward oversaving.</p>
<p>Of even greater importance was his explanation of the unemploy-</p>
<p>ment of a chronic depression. In the universe of classical economics
a</p>
<p>long-term depression simply could not happen; before a
maladjustment</p>
<p>could reach depression proportions it would have been corrected by
the</p>
<p>infallible and automatic mechanism of falling prices and falling
costs.</p>
<p>Yet long before 1929 long-term depressions had become far too
famil-</p>
<p>iar for their existence to be denied except by the most bigoted
academi-</p>
<p>cian. Hence, orthodox economics had to engage in a search for the</p>
<p>criminal conspiracy that prevented “natural“ adjustment and
correc-</p>
<p>ion. Price monopolies, unions, government intervention through
relief</p>
<p>payments, subsidies, and tariffs-these and all the other measures
by</p>
<p>which society seeks to protect itself against the social destruction
of a</p>
<p>depression-became diabolical forces; and the resulting
persecution</p>
<p>mania of the economists who saw the cloven hoof in the mildest</p>
<p>attempt at controlling economic forces soon made it impossible to
base</p>
<p>economic policy on the classical theories, even though these
theories</p>
<p>hemselves were still generally accepted. From 1870 to 1930
economic</p>
<p>policy was without proper theoretical basis. The ruling theory
could</p>
<p>not justify any of the measures actually taken; and as any
economic</p>
<p>policy that was possible politically was open to condemnation on</p>
<p>heoretical grounds, theory furnished no guidance to distinguish
be-</p>
<p>ween beneficial and destructive policies. Out of social necessity
every</p>
<p>economist in office had to do things he opposed in his writings;
the</p>
<p>resulting blend of cynicism and bad conscience finally gave us that
evil</p>
<p>genius of old-school financial economists, Dr. Schacht, Hitler’s
finan-</p>
<p>cial manipulator.</p>
<p>But with money a factor, the automatic and infallible adjustment</p>
<p>becomes the exception rather than the rule. In a credit economy
prices</p>
<p>and wages cannot adjust themselves very readily; they must be
com-</p>
<p>paratively inflexible. For a very large-indeed, the largest-part of
all</p>
<p>costs is the money obligation for the past. This obligation is
unaffected</p>
<p>by changes in the present value of money as the goods and services
it</p>
<p>represents were produced in the past at past prices and wages. We
may</p>
<p>add-though this may be going beyond Keynes-that prices and</p>
<p>wages are also hard to adjust downward because money has a social</p>
<p>meaning, independent largely of its purchasing power; it buys not
only</p>
<p>goods but prestige. This is especially true of the lower income
levels</p>
<p>where the weekly money wage represents a definite social
position.</p>
<p>Keynes: Economics as a Magical System 123</p>
<p>For these reasons, the adjustment in a depression will not, in
the</p>
<p>modem economy, take the form of lower prices and lower wages.</p>
<p>Prices and wages will tend to stay up. Hence the adjustment will
take</p>
<p>he only form possible: lower employment both of men and of
capital</p>
<p>equipment. And, unlike the adjustment through lower prices and</p>
<p>wages, unemployment not only does not tend to correct the
depression;</p>
<p>it tends to make the disequilibrium permanent.</p>
<p>Actually, under modern conditions prices will fall, though not as</p>
<p>evenly as they should-and with significant exceptions in the
capital-</p>
<p>goods fields. But wage rates will not go down. In the first place,
the</p>
<p>wage earner has usually much less margin between his income and
his</p>
<p>fixed obligations than the industrialist; hence the economic
factors</p>
<p>militate against wage cuts. Second, the political pressure of
organized</p>
<p>labor is much more effective in modern society than the economic</p>
<p>power even of the strongest monopolist. Hence the maladjustment
will</p>
<p>not only not be corrected in the “normal course of events“; it
will</p>
<p>become worse. The point at which new investments again become</p>
<p>profitable will recede into the distance. From this follows one
of</p>
<p>Keynes’s most important and, at first sight, most paradoxical
conch-</p>
<p>sions: that we have to raise prices in a depression in order to
obtain the</p>
<p>very effect orthodox economics expected to get from falling
prices.</p>
<p>These general theories have been justly criticized for their
narrow</p>
<p>emphasis on the monetary phenomenon to the exclusion of
everything</p>
<p>else. The monetary factor is probably only one of the causes of a</p>
<p>depression, though perhaps a central one, rather than, as Keynes</p>
<p>asserts, always and everywhere the only cause. But aside from this
not</p>
<p>unimportant question of emphasis, the Keynesian theories have
been</p>
<p>almost universally accepted. And with these basic theories a
great</p>
<p>many economists also accepted at first his economic policies. But,
as</p>
<p>most of the disciples have begun to find out, Keynes’s economic</p>
<p>policies do not follow from his basic theories; indeed, they are
hardly</p>
<p>compatible with them. His policies were really dictated by his
political</p>
<p>aim, not by his economic observations. His attempt to bring the
two</p>
<p>ogether into one whole, to make the policies emerge as the
inevitable</p>
<p>conclusion from the theories, may very well explain the tortuous
and</p>
<p>ortured style of his later writing, his increasing reliance on
purely</p>
<p>formal arguments, and his uncritical use of mathematical
techniques.</p>
<p>According to Keynes the economic theorist, the level of business</p>
<p>activity is determined by the amount of investment in capital
goods,</p>
<p>which in turn is determined by the confidence which leads
business-</p>
<p>men to borrow for expansion. Business activity depends in the
last</p>
<p>analysis on psychological, that is on economically irrational,
factors.</p>
<p>According to Keynes the economic politician, the very confidence</p>
<p>which creates credit is itself strictly determined by credit.
Keynes</p>
<p>offers two answers to the question of what causes confidence. He</p>
<p>asserts that confidence is a function of the interest rate: the lower
the</p>
<p>rate, the greater the confidence. He also asserts that confidence is
a</p>
<p>function of consumer spending: the higher consumer purchases, the</p>
<p>higher the investment in capital goods. In his theories Keynes seems
to</p>
<p>have wavered between these two answers; politically, it does not
make</p>
<p>oo much difference, however, which explanation is preferred. Both</p>
<p>lead to pretty much the same conclusion: the quantity of money or</p>
<p>credit available determines the degree of confidence, with it the
rate of</p>
<p>investment, and thus the level of business activity and of
employment.</p>
<p>Hence Keynes’s monetary panacea for booms and depression: in a</p>
<p>boom, prevent maladjustment through “draining off“ purchasing</p>
<p>power into a budget surplus; in a depression, cure maladjustment
by</p>
<p>creating purchasing power through budget deficits. In either case
the</p>
<p>quantity of money automatically and infallibly regulates
confidence.</p>
<p>Keynes starts out with the statement that human behavior in eco-</p>
<p>nomic life is not, as the classical economists assumed, determined
by</p>
<p>objective economic forces, but that, on the contrary, economic
forces</p>
<p>are directed, if not determined, by human behavior. He ends by</p>
<p>asserting as rigid an economic determinism of human behavior and</p>
<p>actions as any Ricardo or Malthus ever proclaimed. By this
assertion</p>
<p>Keynes’s entire economic policy stands and falls. And it is this
asser-</p>
<p>ion that was conclusively refuted by the experience of the New
Deal.</p>
<p>The New Deal-at least from 1935 to 1939-was based on deficit</p>
<p>spending which created consumer purchasing power and forced down</p>
<p>he level of interest rates. Neither brought about a resumption of</p>
<p>investment or a significant cut in unemployment. With the credit</p>
<p>pumped into the banks, business promptly repaid its old debts
instead</p>
<p>Keynes: Economics as a Magical System 125</p>
<p>of borrowing for new investments; and the money paid out by the</p>
<p>government to the consumers flowed back to the banks almost at
once</p>
<p>o become “oversavings. “</p>
<p>The faithful Keynesians have been hard pressed to explain away</p>
<p>what happened. Their favorite argument is that political opposition
to</p>
<p>he New Deal offset the economically created confidence. But this</p>
<p>defense is not permissible, let alone convincing. Either confidence
can</p>
<p>be created by creating credit and purchasing power regardless of
the</p>
<p>way business or any other group feels about governmental policy,
or</p>
<p>Keynes’s economic policies are wrong. And confidence has been</p>
<p>conclusively proved not to be producible by a check-writing
machine.</p>
<p>Most of the disciples of the earlier years have drawn the
conclusions</p>
<p>from this experience. They are still Keynesians in their
theoretical</p>
<p>analysis, but no longer so in their policies. They continue to
express</p>
<p>heir thoughts in monetary terms, but they no longer talk about
the</p>
<p>interest rate or even about budget deficits or surpluses.
Consumer</p>
<p>purchasing power and “confidence“ have all but disappeared from</p>
<p>heir vocabulary. The program of the most influential group of</p>
<p>Keynesian economists in this country-as written by Alvin Hansen
of</p>
<p>Harvard into the original draft of the Full Employment
bill-provided</p>
<p>hat, in times of depression and unemployment, the government
shall</p>
<p>produce capital goods through public works and government orders
in</p>
<p>a quantity sufficient to bring the total capital goods production to
a</p>
<p>level which gives full employment. Whether this is done with or</p>
<p>without a deficit, at a high or at a low interest rate, is of very
minor</p>
<p>importance; what matters to the neo-Keynesian of today is not
mon-</p>
<p>etary policy, but capital-goods production. This shift denies
both</p>
<p>Keynes’s economic concepts and his overall political goal.</p>
<p>In fact, this shift even caught up with Keynes himself.
Ironically</p>
<p>enough, the very event which brought him official recognition and</p>
<p>honors showed up the shortcomings of his theories and policies. In
the</p>
<p>course of the war, Keynes became the official financial adviser to
his</p>
<p>government, a director of the Bank of England, a member of the</p>
<p>peerage. For the first time his native country officially adopted</p>
<p>Keynesian ideas as the basis of its financial policy; the
measures</p>
<p>outlined in his little pamphlet, How to Pay for the War, were
adopted</p>
<p>almost unchanged by the British government. But the war also</p>
<p>showed, especially in Britain, that monetary policy is quite
subordi-</p>
<p>nate and that, by itself, it achieves very little. England’s war
produc-</p>
<p>ion was obtained not by directing the flow of money, credit, and</p>
<p>purchasing power, but through physical controls of men, raw mate-</p>
<p>rials, plant equipment, and output which could have worked almost
as</p>
<p>well with a different monetary policy; in Nazi Germany and in the</p>
<p>United States they worked without any monetary policy at all.</p>
<p>In the popular mind Keynes stands for government intervention in</p>
<p>business. This may well be a correct evaluation of the ultimate
effect</p>
<p>of Keynesian economics; but if so, Keynes achieved precisely the</p>
<p>opposite of what he intended to achieve. For the one passionate aim
of</p>
<p>his policies was to make possible an economic system free from</p>
<p>government interference, a system determined exclusively by
objec-</p>
<p>ive and impersonal economic forces. “The free market is dead,
long</p>
<p>live the free market,“ would be a fitting motto for his entire
work.</p>
<p>Keynes’s basic insight was the realization that the free market of
the</p>
<p>classical economists fails to adjust itself automatically as
predicted</p>
<p>because the economic forces of demand and supply, cost and price,
are</p>
<p>overridden by the psychological forces of money and credit. From
this</p>
<p>basis several conclusions as to economic policy would have been</p>
<p>logically possible.</p>
<p>Keynes could have argued that conscious political action had to</p>
<p>achieve by breaking through the money wall what the market forces</p>
<p>should have achieved by themselves. That would have been an eco-</p>
<p>nomic policy of direct government intervention into production</p>
<p>hrough public works and public orders rather than a policy of
credit</p>
<p>creation; and it is precisely what most of the neo-Keynesians
have</p>
<p>advocated. Such a policy would restore the supremacy of the
“real“</p>
<p>system, but at the price of its political independence.</p>
<p>Keynes might also have arrived in logical development from his</p>
<p>premises at a policy in which governmental action is used only to</p>
<p>induce private business to build up reservoirs of capital-goods
produc-</p>
<p>ion for use in a depression, for instance, through a system of
tax</p>
<p>rewards for building up reserves in good years to be coupled with
stiff</p>
<p>ax penalties incurred if these reserves are not used for
employment-</p>
<p>creating new investments in a depression. He might even have come
to</p>
<p>Keynes: Economics as a Magical System 127</p>
<p>he conclusion that the proper policy is psychological rather than</p>
<p>economic, i.e., propaganda to create confidence; the German
econo-</p>
<p>mist Knapp, whose ideas had great influence on Keynes, actually
gave</p>
<p>his answer.</p>
<p>The one conclusion which logically and theoretically it seems im-</p>
<p>possible to derive from Keynes’s premise is the one he actually
did</p>
<p>derive. But it was the one and only conclusion which gave Keynes
the</p>
<p>desired political result: the maintenance of a laissez-faire
political</p>
<p>system in which only objective economic factors determine the
econ-</p>
<p>omy and in which man’s economic activities are entirely under the</p>
<p>control of the individual, not under that of the government.</p>
<p>If the liberal state of nineteenth-century laissez faire wag a
night</p>
<p>watchman protecting the peaceful and law-abiding burgher against</p>
<p>hieves and disturbers of the peace, Keynes’s state was a
thermostat</p>
<p>protecting the individual citizen against sharp changes in the
tempera-</p>
<p>ure. And it was to be a fully automatic thermostat. A fall in
economic</p>
<p>activity would switch on credit; a rise would cut it off again; and
in a</p>
<p>boom the mechanism would work in reverse. In contrast to the
nine-</p>
<p>eenth-century state, Keynes’s state was, indeed, to act positively;
but</p>
<p>he actions as well as their timing were to be determined strictly
by</p>
<p>economic statistics, not subject to political manipulation. The
only</p>
<p>purpose of these actions was to restore the individual’s freedom in
the</p>
<p>economic sphere, that is, the freedom from all but economic
factors,</p>
<p>from all but economic considerations-with “economic“ referring to</p>
<p>he “real“ economy of the classics.</p>
<p>The economic system of orthodox economics had been a machine</p>
<p>built by the “divine watchmaker,“ hence without friction and in</p>
<p>perpetual motion and perpetual equilibrium. Keynes’s system was a</p>
<p>clock, a very good and artful clock, but still one built by a
human</p>
<p>watchmaker, and thus subject to friction. But the only actions
required</p>
<p>of the watchmaker were to wind, to oil, and, where necessary, to</p>
<p>regulate the clock. He was not to run it; he was only to make it fit
to</p>
<p>run itself; and it was to run according to mechanical laws, not
accord-</p>
<p>ing to political decisions.</p>
<p>Keynes’s basic aim of restoring by unorthodox methods the ortho-</p>
<p>dox automatic market system, his basic belief that his methods
were</p>
<p>objective, nonpolitical, and capable of determination by the
imper-</p>
<p>sonal yardstick of statistics, show best in his last major work:
the</p>
<p>“Keynes Plan“ of an international currency and credit system pro-</p>
<p>posed in 1943. This plan projected his policies from the national
into</p>
<p>he international sphere. It proposed to overcome international
depres-</p>
<p>sions and maladjustments by the adjustment of prices and
purchasing</p>
<p>power through international credit creation. The agency which was
to</p>
<p>be in control of this international currency and credit was not to be
a</p>
<p>world government, but an international body of economic
statisticians</p>
<p>governed by index numbers and almost entirely without
discretionary</p>
<p>power. The result of this international system and its main
justification</p>
<p>was to be the restoration of the full freedom and equilibrium in</p>
<p>international trade and currency movements.</p>
<p>Critics have rightly pointed out that Keynes was nalve, to a
degree</p>
<p>amazing in such an accomplished and experienced political practi-</p>
<p>ioner, in believing that his system could really be immune to
political</p>
<p>manipulation. It may be possible to obtain objective statistics. But
to</p>
<p>be meaningful, statistics have to be interpreted by human beings;
and</p>
<p>interpretations will differ radically with the political beliefs and
desires</p>
<p>of the interpreter-as witness the widely accepted 1945 forecast of
ten</p>
<p>million unemployed in the United States by the spring of 1946,
made</p>
<p>in food faith by government experts interested in setting up a
planned</p>
<p>economy. Also, even impersonal and objective control is still
control;</p>
<p>and it is an old political axiom that a government that controls
the</p>
<p>national income, i.e., the livelihood of the people, inevitably
controls</p>
<p>he souls of the people. Keynes’s political system, in which the
state</p>
<p>has the power to interfere in the individual’s economic activities
but</p>
<p>refrains from using it, is thus a very different thing from his
ideal, the</p>
<p>state of nineteenth-century liberalism which was without power of</p>
<p>interference.</p>
<p>But the decisive criticism of Keynes’s argument is not that there
are</p>
<p>flaws in it, but that it is an irrational argument. It says in brief:
we have</p>
<p>proved that the factors that control economic activity are
economically</p>
<p>irrational, i.e., psychological factors; therefore they themselves
must</p>
<p>be controllable by an economic mechanism. But this “therefore“ is</p>
<p>not of the vocabulary of reason, not even of that of faith; it is
the</p>
<p>“therefore“ of magic. It is on this very belief-that the
admittedly</p>
<p>irrational can be controlled and directed by mechanical
means-that</p>
<p>every system of magic is based. The Keynesian “policies,“ in
spite-</p>
<p>or perhaps because-f their elaborate apparatus of mathematical</p>
<p>Keynes: Economics as a Magical System 129</p>
<p>formulae and statistical tables, are spells. Because of this, the
fact that</p>
<p>hey failed once, in the New Deal, means that they have failed
forever.</p>
<p>For it is of the nature of a spell that it ceases altogether to be
effective</p>
<p>as soon as it is broken once.</p>
<p>But it was precisely its irrationality that made Keynes’s policy
so</p>
<p>convincing to the generation of the long armistice. After World War
I</p>
<p>he Western world suddenly awakened to the realization that the
basic</p>
<p>nineteenth-century assumptions no longer applied. But it refused
to</p>
<p>face the necessity of new thought and decision. The timid pulled
the</p>
<p>featherbed of normalcy over their eyes and ears to sleep on a
little</p>
<p>longer. The courageous accepted the new situation, but attempted
to</p>
<p>avoid facing it by finding a formula, a mechanical gadget, a spell,
in</p>
<p>other words, which would make the new behave as if it were the
old.</p>
<p>One example would be the labor policy of the New Deal. It started</p>
<p>with the realization that social and political relationships, rather
than</p>
<p>he purely economic nexus of the pay check, are the essence of
modem</p>
<p>industry. But it concluded that the mechanical device of “equal
bar-</p>
<p>gaining power“ on economic issues would do the trick. Another</p>
<p>example is in the field of international relations. Here World War I
had</p>
<p>clearly shown that peace cannot be based on the concept of equal</p>
<p>sovereign states whose internal and external policies are
nobody’s</p>
<p>business but their own. The answer was a strictly mechanical
formula,</p>
<p>he League of Nations, which represented nothing but the equal
sover-</p>
<p>eign states in their fullest equality and sovereignty, which was
neither</p>
<p>a supergovernment nor a supercourt, not even an alliance of the
Great</p>
<p>Powers, but which was expected, in some magical way, to overcome</p>
<p>sovereignty.</p>
<p>We can trace this desire for a mechanical formula to make the new</p>
<p>function like the old, to make what was irrational in the old
assump-</p>
<p>ions again behave rationally, into fields far removed from politics.
It</p>
<p>explains, for instance, the tremendous appeal of Freudian psycho-</p>
<p>analysis as a cure-all. Freud had had the insight to see the fallacy
of</p>
<p>raditional, mechanist psychology-the same psychology on which the</p>
<p>classical economists had based themselves, incidentally. He
realized</p>
<p>hat man is not a bundle of mechanical reflexes and reactions, but
a</p>
<p>personality. But he avoided facing the problem-a philosophical or</p>
<p>religious one-by asserting that this personality is determined
biolog-</p>
<p>ically, that it operates through the grossly mechanical forces of
repres-</p>
<p>sion and sublimation, and that it can be controlled by the
mechanical</p>
<p>echnique of analysis.</p>
<p>But the area in which the desire for a magical system was
greatest</p>
<p>was that of politics. And in the political field Keynes’s
economic</p>
<p>policy was the most accomplished, the most brilliant, the most
elegant</p>
<p>attempt to make the impossible again possible, the irrational
again</p>
<p>rational.</p>
<p>In the field of economic thought, Keynes was both a beginning and</p>
<p>an end. He showed that classical economics no longer apply and
why.</p>
<p>He showed that economic theory has to give an answer to a new</p>
<p>problem: the impact of man, acting as a human being and not as an</p>
<p>economic machine, on the economy. But he contributed little or</p>
<p>nothing to the solution of these new problems; he himself never
went</p>
<p>beyond the classical methods and the classical analysis. Indeed, it
may</p>
<p>be said that he held back economic thought. Before he came to</p>
<p>dominate the scene we had made promising beginnings toward an</p>
<p>understanding of the human factor in economic life in such books
as</p>
<p>Knight’s Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit and Schumpeter’s Theory of</p>
<p>Economic Dynamics, both written around World War I; and at the</p>
<p>Haward Business School, Elton Mayo had begun his pioneering stud-</p>
<p>ies of the relationship between worker and production. Keynes’s
influ-</p>
<p>ence, his magnetic attraction on young men in the field, made
theoreti-</p>
<p>cal economics again focus on the mechanical equilibrium and on a</p>
<p>mechanical concept of economic man determined by impersonal and</p>
<p>purely quantitative forces.</p>
<p>Keynes’s main legacy is in the field of economic policy. He has</p>
<p>formulated our tasks here; even the term “full employment“ is
his.</p>
<p>But his only contribution to a solution-by no means an
unimportant</p>
<p>one-was to show us which way we cannot go; we cannot, as he did,</p>
<p>assert that economic policy is possible without a political decision.
We</p>
<p>may decide perhaps that the state has to assume direct economic</p>
<p>control of production-the decision of most of the neo-Keynesians.</p>
<p>This decision raises the question of how political freedom can be</p>
<p>maintained in such a state. It also brings up the equally
difficult</p>
<p>question of what the state is to produce and who is to decide on it;
so</p>
<p>Keynes: Economics as a Magical System 131</p>
<p>far no state, whether capitalist, fascist, or socialist, has been
able to</p>
<p>overcome unemployment by direct government intervention except</p>
<p>hrough producing armaments and armaments plants, that is, through
a</p>
<p>war economy.</p>
<p>Or we can decide that the state has to create by political means
the</p>
<p>conditions in which a free-enterprise economy will itself prevent
and</p>
<p>overcome depressions. Such a policy is not impossible to devise
on</p>
<p>paper. We would need a fiscal policy that recognizes that
industrial</p>
<p>production extends over the business cycle, rather than one based
on</p>
<p>he fiction of the annual profit. We would need a policy of
definite</p>
<p>encouragement of new ventures and of capital investment in bad
years.</p>
<p>And we would need a labor policy which, while restoring the flex-</p>
<p>ibility of wages through tying them in with productive efficiency
and</p>
<p>with business profits, gives security through such employment
guaran-</p>
<p>ees as an annual wage. But all this raises the question of how
such</p>
<p>policies, which demand of all groups that they subordinate their
short-</p>
<p>erm interests to the long-term good of the whole, can be realized in
a</p>
<p>popular government based on sectional groups and subject to their</p>
<p>constant pressure.</p>
<p>But Keynes himself cannot help us to make these decisions, or to</p>
<p>answer these questions.</p>
