<h4 id="schumpeter-and-keynes">Schumpeter and Keynes</h4>
<p>The two greatest economists of this century, Joseph A. Schumpeter</p>
<p>and John Maynard Keynes, were born, only a few months apart, a</p>
<p>hundred years ago: Schumpeter on February 8, 1883, in a
provincial</p>
<p>Austrian town; Keynes on June 5, 1883, in Cambridge, England.
(And</p>
<p>hey died only four years apart-Schumpeter in Connecticut on Janu-</p>
<p>ary 8, 1950, Keynes in southern England on April 21, 1946.) The</p>
<p>centenary of Keynes’ birth is being celebrated with a host of
books,</p>
<p>articles, conferences, and speeches. If the centenary of
Schumpeter’s</p>
<p>birth were noticed at all, it would be in a small doctoral seminar.
And</p>
<p>yet it is becoming increasingly clear that it is Schumpeter who
will</p>
<p>shape the thinking and inform the questions on economic theory
and</p>
<p>economic policy for the rest of this century, if not for the next
thirty or</p>
<p>fifty years.</p>
<p>The two men were not antagonists. Both challenged long-standing</p>
<p>assumptions. The opponents of Keynes were the very “Austrians“</p>
<p>Schumpeter himself had broken away from as a student, the
neoclassi-</p>
<p>cal economists of the Austrian School. And although Schumpeter</p>
<p>considered all of Keynes’s answers wrong, or at least misleading,
he</p>
<p>was a sympathetic critic. Indeed, it was Schumpeter who
established</p>
<p>Keynes in America. When Keynes’s masterpiece, The General Theory</p>
<p>of Employment, Interest and Money, came out in 1936, Schumpeter,</p>
<p>by then the senior member of the Harvard economics faculty, told
his</p>
<p>First published in Forbes Magazine, 1983.</p>
<p>students to read the book and told them also that Keynes’s work
had</p>
<p>otally superseded his own earlier writings on money.</p>
<p>Keynes, in turn, considered Schumpeter one of the few contempo-</p>
<p>rary economists worthy of his respect. In his lectures he again
and</p>
<p>again referred to the works Schumpeter had published during World</p>
<p>War I, and especially to Schumpeter’s essay on the Rechenpfennige</p>
<p>(that is, money of account) as the initial stimulus for his own
thoughts</p>
<p>on money. Keynes’s most successful policy initiative, the
proposal</p>
<p>hat Britain and the United States finance World War I1 by taxes
rather</p>
<p>han by borrowing, came directly out of Schumpeter’s 1918 warning
of</p>
<p>he disastrous consequences of the debt financing of World War I.</p>
<p>Schumpeter and Keynes are often contrasted politically, with</p>
<p>Schumpeter being portrayed as the “conservative“ and Keynes the</p>
<p>“radical. “ The opposite is more nearly right. Politically
Keynes’s</p>
<p>views were quite similar to what we now call “neoconservative.“
His</p>
<p>heory had its origins in his passionate attachment to the free
market</p>
<p>and in his desire to keep politicians and governments out of it.
Schum-</p>
<p>peter, by contrast, had serious doubts about the free market. He</p>
<p>hought that an “intelligent monopolyM-the American Bell Tele-</p>
<p>phone system, for instance-had a great deal to recommend itself.
It</p>
<p>could afford to take the long view instead of being driven from</p>
<p>ransaction to transaction by short-term expediency. His closest
friend</p>
<p>for many years was the most radical and most doctrinaire of
Europe’s</p>
<p>left-wing socialists, the Austrian Otto Bauer, who, though
staunchly</p>
<p>anticommunist, was even more anticapitalist. And Schumpeter, al-</p>
<p>hough never even close to being a socialist himself, served
during</p>
<p>1919 as minister of finance in Austria’s only socialist
government</p>
<p>between the wars. Schumpeter always maintained that Marx had been</p>
<p>dead wrong in every one of his answers. But he still considered
himself</p>
<p>a son of Marx and held him in greater esteem than any other
econo-</p>
<p>mist. At least, so he argued, Marx asked the right questions, and
to</p>
<p>Schumpeter questions were always more important than answers.</p>
<p>The differences between Schumpeter and Keynes go much deeper</p>
<p>han economic theorems or political views. The two saw a different</p>
<p>economic reality, were concerned with different problems, and
defined</p>
<p>economics quite differently. These differences are highly important
to</p>
<p>an understanding of today’s economic world.</p>
<p>Keynes, for all that he broke with classical economics, operated</p>
<p>Schumpeter and Keynes 109</p>
<p>entirely within its framework. He was a heretic rather than an
infidel.</p>
<p>Economics, for Keynes, was the equilibrium economics of Ricardo’s</p>
<p>1810 theories, which dominated the nineteenth century. This
econom-</p>
<p>ics deals with a closed system and a static one. Keynes’s key
question</p>
<p>was the same question the nineteenth-century economists had
asked:</p>
<p>“How can one maintain an economy in balance and stasis?“</p>
<p>For Keynes, the main problems of economics are the relationship</p>
<p>between the “real economy“ of goods and services and the “symbol</p>
<p>economy“ of money and credit; the relationship between
individuals</p>
<p>and businesses and the “macroeconomy“ of the nation-state; and</p>
<p>finally, whether production (that is, supply) or consumption (that
is,</p>
<p>demand) provides the driving force of the economy. In this sense</p>
<p>Keynes was in a direct line with Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, the</p>
<p>“Austrians,“ and Alfred Marshall. However much they differed oth-</p>
<p>erwise, most of these nineteenth-century economists, and that
includes</p>
<p>Marx, had given the same answers to these questions: The “real</p>
<p>economy“ controls, and the money is only the “veil of things,“
the</p>
<p>microeconomy of individuals and businesses determines, and
govern-</p>
<p>ment can, at best, correct minor discrepancies, and, at worst,
create</p>
<p>dislocations; and supply controls, with demand a function of it.</p>
<p>Keynes asked the same questions that Ricardo, Mill, Marx, the
“Aus-</p>
<p>rians,“ and Marshall had asked but, with unprecedented audacity,</p>
<p>urned every one of the answers upside down. In the Keynesian</p>
<p>system, the “symbol economy“ of money and credit are “real,“ and</p>
<p>goods and services dependent on it and are its shadows. The
macro-</p>
<p>economy-the economy of the nation-state-is everything, with indi-</p>
<p>viduals and firms having neither power to influence, let alone to
direct,</p>
<p>he economy nor the ability to make effective decisions counter to
the</p>
<p>forces of the macroeconomy. And economic phenomena, capital for-</p>
<p>mation, productivity, and employment are functions of demand.</p>
<p>By now we know, as Schumpeter knew fifty years ago, that every</p>
<p>one of these Keynesian answers is the wrong answer. At least they
are</p>
<p>valid only for special cases and within fairly narrow ranges. Take,
for</p>
<p>instance, Keynes’s key theorem: that monetary events-government</p>
<p>deficits, interest rates, credit volume, and volume of money in</p>
<p>circulation-determine demand and with it economic conditions.
This</p>
<p>assumes, as Keynes himself stressed, that the turnover velocity
of</p>
<p>money is constant and not capable of being changed over the short</p>
<p>erm by individuals or firms. Schumpeter pointed out fifty years
ago</p>
<p>hat all evidence negates this assumption. And indeed, whenever
tried,</p>
<p>Keynesian economic policies, whether in the original Keynesian or
in</p>
<p>he modified Friedman version, have been defeated by the
microecon-</p>
<p>omy of business and individuals, unpredictably and without
warning,</p>
<p>changing the turnover velocity of money almost overnight.</p>
<p>When the Keynesian prescriptions were initially tried-in the
United</p>
<p>States in the early New Deal days-they seemed at first to work.
But</p>
<p>hen, around 1935 or so, consumers and businesses suddenly sharply</p>
<p>reduced the turnover velocity of money within a few short months,</p>
<p>which aborted a recovery based on government deficit spending and</p>
<p>brought about a second collapse of the stock market in 1937. The
best</p>
<p>example, however, is what happened in this country in 1981 and
1982.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve’s purposeful attempt to control the economy
by</p>
<p>controlling the money supply was largely defeated by consumers
and</p>
<p>businesses who suddenly and almost violently shifted deposits
from</p>
<p>hrifts into money-market funds and from long-term investments
into</p>
<p>liquid assets-that is, from low-velocity into high-velocity
money-to</p>
<p>he point where no one could really tell anymore what the money</p>
<p>supply is or even what the term means. Individuals and businesses</p>
<p>seeking to optimize their self-interest and guided by their
perception of</p>
<p>economic reality will always find a way to beat the “system“-</p>
<p>whether, as in the Soviet bloc, through converting the entire
economy</p>
<p>into one gigantic black market or, as in the United States in 1981
and</p>
<p>1982, through transforming the financial system overnight despite</p>
<p>laws, regulations, or economists.</p>
<p>This does not mean that economics is likely to return to pre-</p>
<p>Keynesian neoclassicism. Keynes’s critique of the neoclassic
answers</p>
<p>is as definitive as Schumpeter’s critique of Keynes. But because
we</p>
<p>now know that individuals can and will defeat the system, we have
lost</p>
<p>he certainty which Keynes imposed on economics and which has</p>
<p>made the Keynesian system the lodestar of economic theory and</p>
<p>economic policy for fifty years. Both Friedman’s monetarism and</p>
<p>supply-side economics are desperate attempts to patch up the
Keynes-</p>
<p>ian system of equilibrium economics. But it is unlikely that either
can</p>
<p>restore the self-contained, self-confident equilibrium economics,
let</p>
<p>Schumpeter and Keynes 111</p>
<p>alone an economic theory or an economic policy in which one
factor,</p>
<p>whether government spending, interest rates, money supply, or tax</p>
<p>cuts, controls the economy predictably and with near certainty.</p>
<p>That the Keynesian answers were not going to prove any more valid</p>
<p>han the pre-Keynesian ones that they replaced was clear to
Schumpe-</p>
<p>er from the beginning. But to him this was much less important
than</p>
<p>hat the Keynesian questions-the questions of Keynes’s
predecessors</p>
<p>as well-were not, Schumpeter thought, the important questions at
all.</p>
<p>To him the basic fallacy was the very assumption that the healthy,
the</p>
<p>“normal,“ economy is an economy in static equilibrium.
Schumpeter,</p>
<p>from his student days on, held that a modern economy is always in</p>
<p>dynamic disequilibrium. Schumpeter’s economy is not a closed
system</p>
<p>like Newton’s universe–or Keynes’s macroeconomy. It is forever</p>
<p>growing and changing and is biological rather than mechanistic in</p>
<p>nature. If Keynes was a “heretic,“ Schumpeter was an “infidel.“</p>
<p>Schumpeter was himself a student of the great men of Austrian</p>
<p>economics and at a time when Vienna was the world capital of</p>
<p>economic theory. He held his teachers in lifelong affection. But
his</p>
<p>doctoral dissertation-it became the earliest of his great books,
The</p>
<p>Theory of Economic Development (which in its original German ver-</p>
<p>sion came out in 1911, when Schumpeter was only twenty-eight
years</p>
<p>old)-starts out with the assertion that the central problem of
econom-</p>
<p>ics is not equilibrium but structural change. This then led to
Schumpe-</p>
<p>er’s famous theorem of the innovator as the true subject of
economics.</p>
<p>Classical economics considered innovation to be outside the system,
as</p>
<p>Keynes did, too. Innovation belonged in the category of “outside</p>
<p>catastrophes“ like earthquakes, climate, or war, which, everybody</p>
<p>knew, have profound influence on the economy but are not part of</p>
<p>economics. Schumpeter insisted that, on the contrary, innovation-</p>
<p>hat is, entrepreneurship that moves resources from old and
obsoles-</p>
<p>cent to new and more productive employments-is the very essence
of</p>
<p>economics and most certainly of a modern economy.</p>
<p>He derived this notion, as he was the first to admit, from Marx.
But</p>
<p>he used it to disprove Marx. Schumpeter’s Economic Development</p>
<p>does what neither the classical economists nor Marx nor Keynes
was</p>
<p>able to do: It makes profit fulfill an economic function. In the
economy</p>
<p>of change and innovation, profit, in contrast to Marx and his theory,
is</p>
<p>not a Mehrwert, a “surplus value“ stolen from the workers. On the</p>
<p>contrary, it is the only source of jobs for workers and of labor
income.</p>
<p>The theory of economic development shows that no one except the</p>
<p>innovator makes a genuine “profit“; and the innovator’s profit is</p>
<p>always quite short-lived. But innovation in Schumpeter’s famous</p>
<p>phrase is also “creative destruction.“ It makes obsolete
yesterday’s</p>
<p>capital equipment and capital investment. The more an economy</p>
<p>progresses, the more capital formation will it therefore need.
Thus</p>
<p>what the classical economist–or the accountant or the stock ex-</p>
<p>change–considers “profit“ is a genuine cost, the cost of staying
in</p>
<p>business, the cost of a future in which nothing is predictable
except</p>
<p>hat today’s profitable business will become tomorrow’s white ele-</p>
<p>phant. Thus, capital formation and productivity are needed to
maintain</p>
<p>he wealth-producing capacity of the economy and, above all, to</p>
<p>maintain today’s jobs and to create tomorrow’s jobs.</p>
<p>Schumpeter’s “innovator“ with his “creative destruction“ is the
only</p>
<p>heory so far to explain why there is something we call “profit.“
The</p>
<p>classical economists very well knew that their theory did not give
any</p>
<p>rationale for profit. Indeed, in the equilibrium economics of a
closed</p>
<p>economic system there is no place for profit, no justification for
it, no</p>
<p>explanation of it. If profit is, however, a genuine cost, and
especially if</p>
<p>profit is the only way to maintain jobs and to create new ones,
then</p>
<p>capitalism becomes again a moral system.</p>
<p>Morality and profits: The classical economists had pointed out
that</p>
<p>profit is needed as the incentive for the risk taker. But is this not
really</p>
<p>a bribe and thus impossible to justify morally? This dilemma had</p>
<p>driven the most brilliant of the nineteenth-century economists,
John</p>
<p>Stuart Mill, to embrace socialism in his later years. It had made it
easy</p>
<p>for Marx to fuse dispassionate analysis of the “system“ with the
moral</p>
<p>revulsion of an Old Testament prophet against the exploiters. The</p>
<p>weakness on moral grounds of the profit incentive enabled Marx at</p>
<p>once to condemn the capitalist as wicked and immoral and assert</p>
<p>“scientifically“ that he serves no function and that his speedy
demise</p>
<p>is “inevitable.“ As soon, however, as one shifts from the axiom of
an</p>
<p>unchanging, self-contained, closed economy to Schumpeter’s dynam-</p>
<p>ic, growing, moving, changing economy, what is called profit is
no</p>
<p>Schumpeter and Keynes 113</p>
<p>longer immoral. It becomes a moral imperative. Indeed, the
question</p>
<p>hen is no longer the question that agitated the classicists and
still</p>
<p>agitated Keynes: How can the economy be structured to minimize
the</p>
<p>bribe of the functionless surplus called profit that has to be handed
over</p>
<p>o the capitalist to keep the economy going? The question in
Schumpe-</p>
<p>er’s economics is always, Is there sufficient profit? Is there
adequate</p>
<p>capital formation to provide for the costs of the future, the costs
of</p>
<p>staying in business, the costs of “creative destruction“?</p>
<p>This alone makes Schumpeter’s economic model the only one that
can</p>
<p>serve as the starting point for the economic policies we need.
Clearly</p>
<p>he Keynesian–or classicist-treatment of innovation as being “out-</p>
<p>side,“ and in fact peripheral to, the economy and with minimum</p>
<p>impact on it, can no longer be maintained (if it ever could have
been).</p>
<p>The basic question of economic theory and economic policy, espe-</p>
<p>cially in highly developed countries, is clearly: How can capital
forma-</p>
<p>ion and productivity be maintained so that rapid technological
change</p>
<p>as well as employment can be sustained? What is the minimum
profit</p>
<p>needed to defray the costs of the future? What is the minimum
profit</p>
<p>needed, above all, to maintain jobs and to create new ones?</p>
<p>Schumpeter gave no answer; he did not much believe in answers.</p>
<p>But seventy years ago, as a very young man, he asked what is
clearly</p>
<p>going to be the central question of economic theory and economic</p>
<p>policy in the years to come.</p>
<p>And then, during World War I, Schumpeter realized, long before</p>
<p>anyone else-and a good ten years before Keynes did-that economic</p>
<p>reality was changing. He realized that World War I had brought
about</p>
<p>he monetarization of the economies of all belligerents. Country
after</p>
<p>country, including his own still fairly backward Austria-Hungary,
had</p>
<p>succeeded during the war in mobilizing the entire liquid wealth of
the</p>
<p>community, partly through taxation but mainly through borrowing.</p>
<p>Money and credit, rather than goods and services, had become the</p>
<p>“real economy. “</p>
<p>In a brilliant essay published in a German economic journal in
July</p>
<p>1918-when the world Schumpeter had grown up in and had known</p>
<p>was crashing down around his ears-he argued that, from now on,</p>
<p>money and credit would be the lever of control. What he argued
was</p>
<p>hat neither supply of goods, as the classicists had argued, nor
demand</p>
<p>for goods, as some of the earlier dissenters had maintained, was
going</p>
<p>o be controlling anymore. Monetary factors–deficits, money,
credit,</p>
<p>axes-were going to be the determinants of economic activity and
of</p>
<p>he allocation of resources.</p>
<p>This is, of course, the same insight on which Keynes later built
his</p>
<p>General Theory. But Schumpeter’s conclusions were radically
differ-</p>
<p>ent from those Keynes reached. Keynes came to the conclusion that
the</p>
<p>emergence of the symbol economy of money and credit made possible</p>
<p>he “economist-king,“ the scientific economist, who by playing on
a</p>
<p>few simple monetary keys-government spending, the interest rate,</p>
<p>he volume of credit, or the amount of money in circulation-would</p>
<p>maintain permanent equilibrium with full employment, prosperity,
and</p>
<p>stability. But Schumpeter’s conclusion was that the emergence of
the</p>
<p>symbol economy as the dominant economy opened the door to tyranny</p>
<p>and, in fact, invited tyranny. That the economist now proclaimed</p>
<p>himself infallible, he considered pure hubris. But, above all, he
saw</p>
<p>hat it was not going to be economists who would exercise the
power,</p>
<p>but politicians and generals.</p>
<p>And then, in the same year, just before World War I ended, Schum-</p>
<p>peter published The Tax State (“The Fiscal State“ would be a
better</p>
<p>ranslation). Again, the insight is the same Keynes reached
fifteen</p>
<p>years later (and, as he often acknowledged, thanks to
Schumpeter):</p>
<p>The modern state, through the mechanisms of taxation and
borrowing,</p>
<p>has acquired the power to shift income and, through “transfer
pay-</p>
<p>ments,“ to control the distribution of the national product. To
Keynes</p>
<p>his power was a magic wand to achieve both social justice and</p>
<p>economic progress, and both economic stability and fiscal respon-</p>
<p>sibility. To Schumpeter-perhaps because he, unlike Keynes, was a</p>
<p>student of both Marx and history-this power was an invitation to</p>
<p>political irresponsibility, because it eliminated all economic
safeguards</p>
<p>against inflation. In the past the inability of the state to tax more
than a</p>
<p>very small proportion of the gross national product, or to borrow
more</p>
<p>han a very small part of the country’s wealth, had made inflation
self-</p>
<p>limiting. Now the only safeguard against inflation would be
political,</p>
<p>hat is, self-discipline. And Schumpeter was not very sanguine
about</p>
<p>he politician’s capacity for self-discipline.</p>
<p>Schumpeter and Keynes 115</p>
<p>Schumpeter’s work as an economist after World War I is of great</p>
<p>importance to economic theory. He became one of the fathers of</p>
<p>business cycle theory.</p>
<p>But Schumpeter’s real contribution during the thirty-two years
be-</p>
<p>ween the end of World War I and his death in 1950 was as a
political</p>
<p>economist. In 1942, when everyone was scared of a worldwide
defla-</p>
<p>ionary depression, Schumpeter published his best-known book, Cap-</p>
<p>italism, Socialism and Democracy, still, and deservedly, read
widely.</p>
<p>In this book he argued that capitalism would be destroyed by its
own</p>
<p>success. This would breed what we would now call the new class:</p>
<p>bureaucrats, intellectuals, professors, lawyers, journalists, all of
them</p>
<p>beneficiaries of capitalism’s economic fruits and, in fact,
parasitical on</p>
<p>hem, and yet all of them opposed to the ethos of wealth production,
of</p>
<p>saving, and of allocating resources to economic productivity. The
forty</p>
<p>years since this book appeared have surely proved Schumpeter to be
a</p>
<p>major prophet.</p>
<p>And then he proceeded to argue that capitalism would be destroyed</p>
<p>by the very democracy it had helped create and made possible. For in
a</p>
<p>democracy, to be popular, government would increasingly shift in-</p>
<p>come from producer to nonproducer, would increasingly move income</p>
<p>from where it would be saved and become capital for tomorrow to</p>
<p>where it would be consumed. Government in a democracy would thus</p>
<p>be under increasing inflationary pressure. Eventually, he
prophesied,</p>
<p>inflation would destroy both democracy and capitalism.</p>
<p>When he wrote this in 1942, almost everybody laughed. Nothing</p>
<p>seemed less likely than an inflation based on economic success.
Now,</p>
<p>forty years later, this has emerged as the central problem of
democracy</p>
<p>and of a free-market economy alike, just as Schumpeter had proph-</p>
<p>esied.</p>
<p>The Keynesians in the 1940s ushered in their “promised land,“ in</p>
<p>which the economist-king would guarantee the perfect equilibrium
of</p>
<p>an eternally stable economy through control of money, credit,
spend-</p>
<p>ing, and taxes. Schumpeter, however, increasingly concerned
himself</p>
<p>with the question of how the public sector could be controlled
and</p>
<p>limited so as maintain political freedom and an economy capable
of</p>
<p>performance, growth, and change. When death overtook him at his</p>
<p>desk, he was revising the presidential address he had given to
the</p>
<p>American Economic Association only a few days earlier. The last</p>
<p>sentence he wrote was “The stagnationists are wrong in their
diagnosis</p>
<p>of the reason the capitalist process should stagnate; they may still
turn</p>
<p>out to be right in their prognosis that it will stagnate-with
sufficient</p>
<p>help from the public sector.“</p>
<p>Keynes’s best-known saying is surely “In the long run we are all</p>
<p>dead.“ This is one of the most fatuous remarks ever made. Of
course,</p>
<p>in the long run we are all dead. But Keynes in a wiser moment</p>
<p>remarked that the deeds of today’s politicians are usually based on
the</p>
<p>heorems of long-dead economists. And it is a total fallacy that,
as</p>
<p>Keynes implies, optimizing the short term creates the right
long-term</p>
<p>future. Keynes is in large measure responsible for the extreme
short-</p>
<p>erm focus of modern politics, of modem economics, and of modem</p>
<p>business-the short-term focus that is now, with considerable
justice,</p>
<p>considered a major weakness of American policymakers, both in</p>
<p>government and in business.</p>
<p>Schumpeter also knew that policies have to fit the short term. He</p>
<p>learned this lesson the hard way-as minister of finance in the
newly</p>
<p>formed Austrian republic in which he, totally unsuccessfully, tried
to</p>
<p>stop inflation before it got out of hand. He knew that he had
failed</p>
<p>because his measures were not acceptable in the short term-the
very</p>
<p>measures that, two years later, a noneconomist, a politician and
pro-</p>
<p>fessor of moral theology did apply to stop the inflation, but only
after it</p>
<p>had all but destroyed Austria’s economy and middle class.</p>
<p>But Schumpeter also knew that today’s short-term measures have</p>
<p>long-term impacts. They irrevocably make the future. Not to think</p>
<p>hrough the futurity of short-term decisions and their impact long
after</p>
<p>“we are all dead“ is irresponsible. It also leads to the wrong
decisions.</p>
<p>It is this constant emphasis in Schumpeter on thinking through
the</p>
<p>long-term consequences of the expedient, the popular, the clever,
and</p>
<p>he brilliant that makes him a great economist and the appropriate</p>
<p>guide for today, when short-run, clever, brilliant economics-and</p>
<p>short-run, clever, brilliant politics-have become bankrupt.</p>
<p>In some ways, Keynes and Schumpeter replayed the best-known</p>
<p>confrontation of philosophers in the Western tradition-the
Platonic</p>
<p>Schumpeter and Keynes 117</p>
<p>dialogue between Protagoras, the brilliant, clever, irresistible
sophist,</p>
<p>and the slow-moving and ugly, but wise Socrates. No one in the</p>
<p>interwar years was more brilliant, more clever than Keynes.
Schumpe-</p>
<p>er, by contrast, appeared pedestrian-but he had wisdom.
Cleverness</p>
<p>carries the day. But wisdom endureth.</p>
