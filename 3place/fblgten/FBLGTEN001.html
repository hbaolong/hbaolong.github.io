<p>What People Are Saying About Nonviolent Communication™</p>
<p>Relationships:</p>
<p>“Marshall Rosenberg’s dynamic communication techniques transform
potential conflicts into peaceful dialogues. You’ll learn simple tools
to defuse arguments and create compassionate connections with your
family, friends, and other acquaintances.”</p>
<p>—JOHN GRAY, author, Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus</p>
<p>“Nonviolent Communication can change the world. More importantly, it
can change your life. I cannot recommend it highly enough.”</p>
<p>—JACK CANFIELD, author, Chicken Soup for the Soul Series</p>
<p>“Marshall Rosenberg provides us with the most effective tools to
foster health and relationships. Nonviolent Communication connects soul
to soul, creating a lot of healing. It is the missing element in what we
do.”</p>
<p>—DEEPAK CHOPRA, author, How to Know God and Ageless Body and Timeless
Mind</p>
<p>“I have taken conversations that were headed for the dumps, starting
using these techniques, and ended up with a very useful bonding
experience.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“If you want to be heard, and to hear what your loved ones are truly
saying behind what there saying, read this book! It will change your
life.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“Rosenberg has developed a simple method of communicating that helps
to avoid triggering a defensive reaction, and instead stimulate
understanding and agreement. It is invaluable in all your relationships,
and definitely should be required reading for everyone.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>Conflict Transformation:</p>
<p>“Nonviolent Communication is one of the most useful processes you
will ever learn.”</p>
<p>—WILLIAM URY, coauthor, Getting to Yes</p>
<p>“In this book, you will find an amazingly effective language for
saying what’s on your mind and in your heart. Like so many essential and
elegant systems, it’s simple on the surface, challenging to use in the
heat of the moment and powerful in its results.”</p>
<p>—VICKI ROBIN, coauthor, Your Money or Your Life</p>
<p>“As far as nonviolence and spiritual activism, Marshall Rosenberg is
it! Applying the concepts within these books will guide the reader
towards fostering more compassion in the world.”</p>
<p>—MARIANNE WILLIAMSON, author, Everyday Grace and honorary
chairperson, Peace Alliance</p>
<p>“Like Noam Chomsky, Rosenberg’s work is intrinsically radical, it
subverts our whole status-quo system of power: between children and
adults, the sane and the psychotic, the criminal and the law.
Rosenberg’s distinction between punitive and protective force should be
required reading for anyone making foreign policy or policing our
streets.”</p>
<p>—D. KILLIAN, reporter, On The Front Line, Cleveland Free Times</p>
<p>“We have lived traumatic moments over and over again—moments of fear
and panic, incomprehension, frustrations, disappointment, and injustice
of all sorts, with no hope of escape—which made it even worse.
Nonviolent Communication offers us a peaceful alternative for ending
this interminable Rwandan conflict.”</p>
<p>—THEODORE NYILIDANDI, Rwandan Department of Foreign Affairs; Kigali,
Rwanda</p>
<p>“In our present age of uncivil discourse and mean-spirited
demagoguery, the principles and practices of Nonviolent Communication
are as timely as they are necessary to the peaceful resolution of
conflicts, personal or public, domestic or international.”</p>
<p>—MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW, Taylor’s Shelf</p>
<p>“Rosenberg describes how, in numerous conflicts, once ‘enemies’ have
been able to hear each other’s needs, they are able to connect
compassionately and find new solutions to previously ‘impossible’
impasses. If you want to learn ways of more skillful speech I highly
recommend this clear, easy-to-read book.”</p>
<p>—DIANA LION, Buddhist Peace Fellowship, Turning Wheel Magazine</p>
<p>“A simple communication process that eliminates the competitive,
adversarial, and violence provocative style of communication that has
infected most of our lives. This is not about the meek inheriting the
world or being nice docile cogs in our power-over, hierarchical system.
It is about the ‘protective use of force,’ vulnerability, heart-to-heart
dialogue, and getting our needs meet in a way we will less likely
regret.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“As a professional in the field, I can say that this book practices
what it preaches, and I found the step-by-step approach, exercises, and
examples to be clear and easy to practice.”</p>
<p>—A reader in Maryland</p>
<p>“I have never read a clearer, more straightforward, insightful book
on communication. Amazingly easy to read, great examples, and
challenging to put into practice—this book is a true gift to all of
us.”</p>
<p>—A reader in Washington</p>
<p>Personal Growth:</p>
<p>“Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg is a great book
teaching a compassionate way to talk to people—even if you (or they) are
angry.”</p>
<p>—JOE VITALE, author, Spiritual Marketing, The Power of Outrageous
Marketing</p>
<p>“Changing the way the world has worked for 5,000 years sounds
daunting, but Nonviolent Communication helps liberate us from ancient
patterns of violence.”</p>
<p>—FRANCIS LEFKOWITZ, reporter, Body Soul</p>
<p>“A revolutionary way of looking at language. If enough people
actually make use of the material in Nonviolent Communication we may
soon live in a more peaceful and compassionate world.”</p>
<p>—WES TAYLOR, Progressive Health</p>
<p>“The single toughest, most dangerous opponent I’d ever faced—the one
that truly hurt me the most, causing me to spend 30 years of my life
behind bars—was my own anger and fear. I write these words now, a
gray-haired old man, hoping to God—before you suffer what I’ve
suffered—that it will cause you to listen and learn Nonviolent
Communication. It will teach you how to recognize anger before it
becomes violence, and how to understand, deal with, and take control of
the rage you may feel.”</p>
<p>—A prisoner writing to fellow inmates</p>
<p>“This is the most concise, most clearly written manual on
interpersonal communication I’ve ever come across. I’ve been challenged
by this book to be the change I want to see in my world.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“Literally, anyone who speaks could benefit from reading this book!
It helps us to realize not only the power of words, but how to choose
our words better and ultimately enhance both communication and
relationships! Highly recommended!”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“By taking a step back from daily frustrations, disappointments, and
stressors, and re-examining the purpose of my own and others’ needs,
this book has helped me listen more deeply, act more genuinely, and find
acceptance in difficult situations. Well done!”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“I am one of those people who is highly critical of myself. This book
is teaching me to love myself so I can truly care for others. It can
pave the way for peace between people, different ethnic groups,
countries, etc., and I believe our world really needs this.”</p>
<p>Parenting and Family Communication:</p>
<p>“With the growth in today’s dysfunctional families and the increase
of violence in our schools, Nonviolent Communication is a godsend.”</p>
<p>—LINDA C. STOEHR, Los Colinas Business News</p>
<p>“This book is essential reading for anyone seeking to end the
unfulfilling cycles of argument in their relationship, and for parents
who wish to influence their children’s’ behavior by engendering
compassion rather than simply achieving obedience.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“In addition to saving our marriage, Nonviolent Communication is
helping us repair our relationships with our grown children and to
relate more deeply with our parents and siblings. If angels do manifest
in physical form here on this earth, then Marshall Rosenberg must be
one.”</p>
<p>—A reader in Arizona</p>
<p>“My relationship with my husband, which was good already, has become
even better. I’ve taught NVC to many parents who have since gained a
deeper understanding of their children, thus enhancing their
relationship and decreasing tension and conflict.”</p>
<p>—A reader in Illinois</p>
<p>“Nonviolent Communication allowed me to overcome my toxic
conditioning and find the loving parent and person that was locked
inside. Dr. Rosenberg has created a way to transform the violence in the
world.”</p>
<p>—A nurse in California</p>
<p>“Using Nonviolent Communication was vital to healing my relationship
with my sister; and for me, it serves as a guide for applying Buddhist
practice to communication.”</p>
<p>—JANE LAZAR, Zen Student in Residence / NVC Trainer</p>
<p>“What began as a search for a better discipline system for our
six-year-old has turned out to be a philosophical approach and
communication tool that is transforming how we relate to each other and
ourselves.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“Incredible book that has transformed my way of being and
communicating. I have everyone in my family reading it now!”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“I spent 40 years of my life trying to receive empathy from my dad.
After only reading half of this book, I was able to express myself in a
way that he was able to finally hear me and give me what I needed. It
was a gift beyond words.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>Spirituality:</p>
<p>“In my estimation, Nonviolent Communication is as radical and
change-making as the Eight-Fold Path. I predict that active use of NVC
in our sanghas would significantly cut through frustrations and growing
pains.”</p>
<p>—JOAN STARR WARD, member, Spirit Rock Center, California, and the
Buddhist Peace Fellowship</p>
<p>“Buddhism and Nonviolent Communication are rooms in the same house. I
strongly recommend NVC as a highly effective practice for developing
clarity and genuine compassion.”</p>
<p>—LEWIS RHAMES, Vipassana Insight Meditation, Minimal Security Unit,
Monroe Correctional Complex</p>
<p>“For convicts immersed in an environment which intensifies and
reinforces conflict, discovering this step-by-step methodology
advocating compassion through communication is enormously
liberating.”</p>
<p>—DOW GORDON, Freedom Prison Project, Seattle, Washington</p>
<p>“NVC is the language of enlightenment. So simple yet so difficult.
Using NVC can change your life, bring clarity to your thinking, and
transform relationships.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>Education:</p>
<p>“Marshall’s strategies for active listening really work. I teach
middle school, and it has worked both at work and with my family. A good
step along the way to transformation.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“Through compelling, real life examples, Rosenberg brings the NVC
process to life. My college students, especially the older ones, share
with me that reading this book has changed their life. Trying to
practice the steps myself in daily interactions, at meetings, and in the
classroom, has also had a powerful effect on me.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“NVC has made a huge difference in my life with my children,
relatives, teachers of schools, work, and the list goes on. When I
discovered this book, I was really doubtful that anything could help me
change the nature of my relationships with others and I am astonished at
the depth and simplicity of Nonviolent Communication.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>Professional Therapy and Mediation:</p>
<p>“The quality of empathy I now am able to provide has enlivened my
therapy practice. This book gives me hope that I can contribute to the
well being of my clients, and also connect deeply with my friends and
family. The step-by-step empathy skills in this book are learnable by
anyone.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“As a therapist, I have found this book to be helpful to clients with
anger management difficulties, and problems with conflict in
relationships because it promotes self-awareness and self-acceptance.
NVC takes practice, but once you understand and internalize the general
attitude promoted in this book, it sticks. And then it seeps into your
life like a soothing balm.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>“I have never read a clearer, more straightforward, insightful book
on communication. After studying and teaching assertiveness since the
70s, this book is a breath of fresh air. Rosenberg adds the brilliant
insight into the linkage of feelings and needs and taking responsibility
and creates a true tool.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>Business:</p>
<p>“The principles of Nonviolent Communication taught by Dr. Rosenberg
are instrumental in creating an extraordinary and fulfilling quality of
life. His compassionate and inspiring message cuts right to the heart of
successful communication, his heartfelt message and genuine love for
human kind is inspiring, and his strategies hold the power, not only
change lives, but to transform your world.</p>
<p>“Dr. Rosenberg has brought the simplicity of successful communication
into the foreground. No matter what issue you’re facing, his strategies
for communicating with others will set you up to win every time.”</p>
<p>—TONY ROBBINS, author, Awaken the Giant Within and Unlimited
Power</p>
<p>“I got to this book thanks to a recommendation by Satya Nadella (CEO
of Microsoft). The book presents a simple technique and examples to
empathize and connect with people’s feelings. Instead of judging people
by the message, the book helps you understand the needs behind and what
feelings and emotions are driving them. Highly recommended.”</p>
<p>—An online reviewer</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>Deepak Chopra, MD</p>
<p>Founder of the Chopra Center for Wellbeing and author of more than
eighty books translated in over forty-three languages, including
twenty-two New York Times bestsellers</p>
<p>No one deserves our gratitude more than the late Marshall Rosenberg,
who lived his life just as the title of one of his books states: Speak
Peace in a World of Conflict. He was keenly aware of the maxim (or
warning) that’s contained in the subtitle of that book: What You Say
Next Will Change Your World. Personal reality always contains a story,
and the story we live, beginning from infancy, is based on language.
This became the foundation of Marshall’s approach to conflict
resolution, getting people to exchange words in a way that excludes
judgments, blame, and violence.</p>
<p>The contorted faces of protestors on the streets that make such
disturbing images on the evening news are more than images. Each face,
each shout, each gesture has a history. Everyone clings to their history
with a vengeance, because it anchors their identity. So when Marshall
advocated peaceful talk, he was advocating a new identity at the same
time. He fully realized this fact. As he states about Nonviolent
Communication and the role of the mediator in this new third edition,
“We’re trying to live a different value system while we are asking for
things to change.”</p>
<p>In his vision of a new value system, conflicts are resolved without
the usual frustrating compromises. Instead, the contending parties
approach each other with respect. They ask about each other’s needs, and
in an atmosphere free of passions and prejudices, they reach a
connection. Gazing on a world rife with war and violence, where
us-versus-them thinking is the norm, and where countries can break all
bonds of civilized existence to commit unbearable atrocities, a new
value system seems far away. At one European conference for mediators, a
skeptic criticized Marshall’s approach as psychotherapy. In popular
language, isn’t he asking us to simply forget the past and just be
friends, a remote prospect not just in the war-torn areas but in any
divorce case?</p>
<p>Value systems are packed in the luggage of every worldview. Not only
are they inescapable, but people are proud of them—there’s a long
tradition around the world of prizing and fearing warriors at the same
time. Jungians tell us that the archetype of Mars, the volatile god of
war, is imbedded in everyone’s unconscious, making conflict and
aggression inevitable, a kind of inherent vice.</p>
<p>But there’s an alternative view of human nature, eloquently expressed
in this book that must be considered, because it’s our only real hope.
In this view, we are not our stories. These stories are self-created
fictions that remain intact through habit, group coercion, old
conditioning, and lack of self-awareness. Even the best stories
collaborate in violence. If you want to use force to protect your
family, guard yourself from attack, fight against wrongdoing, prevent
crime, and engage in a so-called “good war,” you have been co-opted by
the siren song of violence. If you decide to opt out, there’s a sizable
chance that society will turn on you and exact retribution. In short,
finding a way out isn’t easy.</p>
<p>In India there’s an ancient model for nonviolent living known as
Ahimsa, which is central to the nonviolent life. Ahimsa is usually
defined as nonviolence, although its meaning extends from Mahatma
Gandhi’s peaceful protests to Albert Schweitzer’s reverence for life.
“Do no harm” would be the first axiom of Ahimsa. What so impressed me
about Marshall Rosenberg, who passed away at eighty, just six weeks
before I write this, is that he grasped both levels of Ahimsa, action
and consciousness.</p>
<p>The actions are well described in the following pages as principles
of Nonviolent Communication, so I won’t repeat them here. To be in
Ahimsa consciousness is much more powerful, and Marshall possessed that
trait. In any conflict, he didn’t choose sides or even care primarily
what their stories were. Recognizing that all stories lead to conflict,
either overtly or covertly, he focused on connections as a psychological
bridge. This is in keeping with another axiom of Ahimsa: It’s not what
you do that counts, it’s the quality of your attention. As far as the
legal system is concerned, a divorce is over once the two parties settle
on how to split their assets. But this is far from the result that’s
reached emotionally between the two divorced parties. Too much has been
said, to use Marshall’s wording, that changed their world.</p>
<p>Aggression is built into the ego system, which totally focuses on “I,
me, and mine” whenever conflict arises. Society pays lip service to
saints and their vow to serve God instead of themselves, but there’s a
huge gap between the values we espouse and the way we actually live.
Ahimsa closes this gap only by expanding a person’s awareness. The only
way to resolve all violence is to give up your story. No one can be
enlightened who still has a personal stake in the world—that could be
the third axiom of Ahimsa. But this seems like a teaching as radical as
Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount when he promises that the meek shall
inherit the earth.</p>
<p>In both cases, the point isn’t to change your actions but to change
your consciousness. To do that, you must walk a path from A to B, where
A is a life based on the incessant demands of the ego and B is selfless
awareness. To be frank, nobody really desires selfless awareness; from
the viewpoint of looking out for number one, it sounds at once scary and
impossible. What’s the payoff if you depose the ego, which is all about
payoffs? Once the ego is gone, do you sit around passively like a
spiritual beanbag?</p>
<p>The answer lies in those moments when the personal self falls away
naturally and spontaneously. These occur in moments of meditation or
simply deep contentment. Selfless awareness is the state we’re in when
Nature or art or music creates a sense of wonder. The only difference
between those moments—to which we can add all experiences of creativity,
love, and play—and Ahimsa is that they flicker in and out while Ahimsa
is a settled state. It reveals that stories and the egos that fuel them
are illusions, self-created models for survival and selfishness. The
payoff for Ahimsa isn’t that you upgrade the illusion, which is what the
ego is always striving to do with more money, possessions, and power.
The payoff is that you get to be who you really are.</p>
<p>Higher consciousness is too lofty as the term for Ahimsa. Normal
consciousness is more accurate in a world where the norm is so abnormal
that it amounts to psychopathology. It’s not normal to live in a world
where thousands of nuclear warheads are aimed at the enemy and terrorism
is an acceptable religious act—they are merely the norm.</p>
<p>For me, the legacy of Marshall’s lifelong work doesn’t lie in how he
revolutionized the role of the mediator, valuable as that was. It lies
in the new value system he lived by, which in truth is quite ancient.
Ahimsa has to be revived in every generation, because human nature is
torn between peace and violence. Marshall Rosenberg gave proof that
entering this state of expanded awareness was real and, when it came to
settling disputes, very practical. He leaves footprints that the rest of
us can follow. If we have true self-interest at heart, we will follow.
It’s the only alternative in a world desperately seeking wisdom and the
end of strife.</p>

<h5 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h5>
<p>I’m grateful that I was able to study and work with Professor Carl
Rogers at a time when he was researching the components of a helping
relationship. The results of this research played a key role in the
evolution of the process of communication that I will be describing in
this book.</p>
<p>I will be forever grateful that Professor Michael Hakeem helped me to
see the scientific limitations and the social and political dangers of
practicing psychology in the way that I had been trained: with a
pathology-based understanding of human beings. Seeing the limitations of
this model stimulated me to search for ways of practicing a different
psychology, one based on a growing clarity about how we human beings
were meant to live.</p>
<p>I’m grateful, too, for George Miller’s and George Albee’s efforts to
alert psychologists to the need to find better ways for “giving
psychology away.” They helped me see that the enormity of suffering on
our planet requires more effective ways of distributing much-needed
skills than can be offered by a clinical approach.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Lucy Leu for editing this book and creating the
final manuscript; Rita Herzog and Kathy Smith for their editing
assistance; and, for their additional help, Darold Milligan, Sonia
Nordenson, Melanie Sears, Bridget Belgrave, Marian Moore, Kittrell
McCord, Virginia Hoyte, and Peter Weismiller.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to express gratitude to my friend Annie Muller.
Her encouragement to be clearer about the spiritual foundation of my
work has strengthened that work and enriched my life.</p>
<p>Words Are Windows</p>
<p>(or They’re Walls)</p>
<p>I feel so sentenced by your words,</p>
<p>I feel so judged and sent away,</p>
<p>Before I go I’ve got to know,</p>
<p>Is that what you mean to say?</p>
<p>Before I rise to my defense,</p>
<p>Before I speak in hurt or fear,</p>
<p>Before I build that wall of words,</p>
<p>Tell me, did I really hear?</p>
<p>Words are windows, or they’re walls,</p>
<p>They sentence us, or set us free.</p>
<p>When I speak and when I hear,</p>
<p>Let the love light shine through me.</p>
<p>There are things I need to say,</p>
<p>Things that mean so much to me,</p>
<p>If my words don’t make me clear,</p>
<p>Will you help me to be free?</p>
<p>If I seemed to put you down,</p>
<p>If you felt I didn’t care,</p>
<p>Try to listen through my words,</p>
<p>To the feelings that we share.</p>
<p>—Ruth Bebermeyer</p>
