<h4 id="liberating-ourselves-and-counseling-others">Liberating Ourselves
and Counseling Others</h4>
<h5 id="freeing-ourselves-from-old-programming">Freeing Ourselves From
Old Programming</h5>
<p>We’ve all learned things that limit us as human beings, whether from
well-intentioned parents, teachers, clergy, or others. Passed down
through generations, even centuries, much of this destructive cultural
learning is so ingrained in our lives that we are no longer conscious of
it. In one of his routines, comedian Buddy Hackett, raised on his
mother’s rich cooking, claimed that he never realized it was possible to
leave the table without feeling heartburn until he was in the army. In
the same way, pain engendered by damaging cultural conditioning is such
an integral part of our lives that we can no longer distinguish its
presence. It takes tremendous energy and awareness to recognize this
destructive learning and to transform it into thoughts and behaviors
that are of value and of service to life.</p>
<p>This transformation requires a literacy of needs and the ability to
get in touch with ourselves, both of which are difficult for people in
our culture. Not only have we never been educated about our needs, we
are often exposed to cultural training that actively blocks our
consciousness of them. As mentioned earlier, we have inherited a
language that served kings and powerful elites in domination societies.
The masses, discouraged from developing awareness of their own needs,
have instead been educated to be docile and subservient to authority.
Our culture implies that needs are negative and destructive; the word
needy applied to a person suggests inadequacy or immaturity. When people
express their needs, they are often labeled selfish, and the use of the
personal pronoun I is at times equated with selfishness or
neediness.</p>
<p>By encouraging us to separate observation and evaluation, to
acknowledge the thoughts or needs shaping our feelings, and to express
our requests in clear action language, NVC heightens our awareness of
the cultural conditioning influencing us at any given moment. And
drawing this conditioning into the light of consciousness is a key step
in breaking its hold on us.</p>
<p>We can liberate ourselves from cultural conditioning.</p>
<h5 id="resolving-internal-conflicts">Resolving Internal Conflicts</h5>
<p>We can apply NVC to resolve the internal conflicts that often result
in depression. In his book The Revolution in Psychiatry, Ernest Becker
attributes depression to “cognitively arrested alternatives.” This means
that when we have a judgmental dialogue going on within, we become
alienated from what we are needing and cannot then act to meet those
needs. Depression is indicative of a state of alienation from our own
needs.</p>
<p>A woman studying NVC was suffering a profound bout of depression. She
was asked to identify the voices within her when she felt the most
depressed and to write them down in dialogue form as though they were
speaking to each other. These were the first two lines of her
dialogue:</p>
<p>Voice 1 (“career woman”): I should do something more with my life.
I’m wasting my education and talents.</p>
<p>Voice 2 (“responsible mother”): You’re being unrealistic. You’re a
mother of two children and can’t handle that responsibility, so how can
you handle anything else?</p>
<p>Notice how these inner messages are infested with judgmental terms
and phrases such as should, wasting my education and talents, and can’t
handle. Variations of this dialogue had been running in this woman’s
head for months. She was asked to imagine the “career woman” voice
taking an “NVC pill” in order to restate its message in the following
form: “When a, I feel b, because I am needing c. Therefore I now would
like d.”</p>
<p>She subsequently translated “I should do something with my life. I’m
wasting my education and talents” into: “When I spend as much time at
home with the children as I do without practicing my profession, I feel
depressed and discouraged because I am needing the fulfillment I once
had in my profession. Therefore, I now would like to find part-time work
in my profession.”</p>
<p>Then it was the turn of her “responsible mother” voice to undergo the
same process of translation. These lines, “You’re being unrealistic.
You’re a mother of two children and can’t handle that responsibility, so
how can you handle anything else?” were transformed into: “When I
imagine going to work, I feel scared because I’m needing reassurance
that the children will be well taken care of. Therefore, I now would
like to plan how to provide high-quality child care while I work and how
to find sufficient time to be with the children when I am not
tired.”</p>
<p>This woman felt great relief as soon as she translated her inner
messages into NVC. She was able to get beneath the alienating messages
she was repeating to herself and offer herself empathy. Although she
still faced practical challenges, such as securing quality child care
and her husband’s support, she was no longer subject to the judgmental
internal dialogue that kept her from being aware of her own needs.</p>
<p>The ability to hear our own feelings and needs and empathize with
them can free us from depression.</p>
<h5 id="caring-for-our-inner-environment">Caring for Our Inner
Environment</h5>
<p>When we are entangled in critical, blaming, or angry thoughts, it is
difficult to establish a healthy internal environment for ourselves. NVC
helps us create a more peaceful state of mind by encouraging us to focus
on what we are truly wanting rather than on what is wrong with others or
ourselves.</p>
<p>A participant once reported a profound personal breakthrough during a
three-day training. One of her goals for the workshop was to take better
care of herself, but she woke at dawn the second morning with the worst
headache in recent memory. “Normally, the first thing I’d do would be to
analyze what I had done wrong. Did I eat the wrong food? Did I let
myself get stressed-out? Did I do this; did I not do that? But, since I
had been working on using NVC to take better care of myself, I asked
instead, ‘What do I need to do for myself right now with this
headache?’</p>
<p>Focus on what we want to do rather than what went wrong.</p>
<p>“I sat up and did a lot of really slow neck rolls, then got up and
walked around, and did other things to take care of myself right then
instead of beating up on myself. My headache relaxed to the point where
I was able to go through the day’s workshop. This was a major, major
breakthrough for me. What I understood, when I empathized with the
headache, was that I hadn’t given myself enough attention the day
before, and the headache was a way to say to myself, ‘I need more
attention.’ I ended up giving myself the attention I needed and was then
able to make it through the workshop. I’ve had headaches all my life,
and this was a very remarkable turning point for me.”</p>
<p>At another workshop a participant asked how NVC might be used to free
us from anger-provoking messages when we are driving on the freeway.
This was a familiar topic for me! For years my work involved traveling
by car across the country, and I was worn and frazzled by the
violence-provoking messages racing through my brain. Everybody who
wasn’t driving by my standards was an archenemy, a villain. Thoughts
spewed through my head: “What the hell is the matter with that guy!?
Doesn’t he even watch where he’s driving?” In that state of mind, all I
wanted was to punish the other drivers, and since I couldn’t do that,
the anger lodged in my body and exacted its toll.</p>
<p>Eventually I learned to translate my judgments into feelings and
needs and to give myself empathy: “Boy, I am petrified when people drive
like that; I really wish they would see the danger in what they are
doing!” Whew! I was amazed how I could create a less stressful situation
for myself by simply becoming aware of what I was feeling and needing
rather than blaming others.</p>
<p>Defuse stress by hearing our own feelings and needs.</p>
<p>Later I decided to practice empathy toward other drivers and was
rewarded with a gratifying first experience. I was stuck behind a car
going far below the speed limit and slowing down at every intersection.
Fuming and grumbling, “That’s no way to drive,” I noticed the stress I
was causing myself and shifted my thinking instead to what the other
driver might be feeling and needing. I sensed that the person was lost,
feeling confused, and wishing for some patience from those of us
following. When the road widened enough for me to pass, I saw that the
driver was a woman who looked to be in her eighties with an expression
of terror on her face. I was pleased that my attempt at empathy had kept
me from honking the horn or engaging in my customary tactics of
displaying displeasure toward people whose driving bothered me.</p>
<p>Defuse stress by empathizing with others.</p>
<h5 id="replacing-diagnosis-with-nvc">Replacing Diagnosis With NVC</h5>
<p>Many years ago, after having just invested nine years of my life in
the training and diplomas necessary to qualify as a psychotherapist, I
came across a dialogue between the Israeli philosopher Martin Buber and
the American psychologist Carl Rogers in which Buber questions whether
anyone can do psychotherapy in the role of a psychotherapist. Buber was
visiting the United States at the time and had been invited, along with
Carl Rogers, to a discussion at a mental hospital in front of a group of
mental health professionals.</p>
<p>In this dialogue Buber posits that human growth occurs through a
meeting between two individuals who express themselves vulnerably and
authentically in what he termed an “I-Thou” relationship. He did not
believe that this type of authenticity was likely to exist when people
meet in the roles of psychotherapist and client. Rogers agreed that
authenticity was a prerequisite to growth. He maintained, however, that
enlightened psychotherapists could choose to transcend their own role
and encounter their clients authentically.</p>
<p>Buber was skeptical. He was of the opinion that even if
psychotherapists were committed and able to relate to their clients in
an authentic fashion, such encounters would be impossible as long as
clients continued to view themselves as clients and their
psychotherapists as psychotherapists. He observed how the very process
of making appointments to see someone at their office, and paying fees
to be “fixed,” dimmed the likelihood of an authentic relationship
developing between two persons.</p>
<p>This dialogue clarified my own long-standing ambivalence toward
clinical detachment—a sacrosanct rule in the psychoanalytic
psychotherapy I was taught. To bring one’s own feelings and needs into
the psychotherapy was typically viewed as a sign of pathology on the
part of the therapist. Competent psychotherapists were to stay out of
the therapy process and to function as a mirror onto which clients
projected their transferences, which were then worked through with the
psychotherapist’s help. I understood the theory behind keeping the
psychotherapist’s inner process out of psychotherapy and guarding
against the danger of addressing internal conflicts at the client’s
expense. However, I had always been uncomfortable maintaining the
requisite emotional distance, and furthermore believed in the advantages
of bringing myself into the process.</p>
<p>I thus began to experiment by replacing clinical language with the
language of NVC. Instead of interpreting what my clients were saying in
line with the personality theories I had studied, I made myself present
to their words and listened empathically. Instead of diagnosing them, I
revealed what was going on within myself. At first, this was
frightening. I worried about how colleagues would react to the
authenticity with which I was entering into dialogue with clients.
However, the results were so gratifying to both my clients and myself
that I soon overcame any hesitation. Today, thirty-five years later, the
concept of bringing oneself fully into the client-therapist relationship
is no longer heretical, but when I began practicing this way, I was
often invited to speak to groups of psychotherapists who would challenge
me to demonstrate this new role.</p>
<p>I empathized with clients instead of interpreting them; I revealed
myself instead of diagnosing them.</p>
<p>Once I was asked, by a large gathering of mental health professionals
at a state mental hospital, to show how NVC might serve in counseling
distressed people. After my one-hour presentation, I was requested to
interview a patient in order to produce an evaluation and recommendation
for treatment. I talked with the twenty-nine-year-old mother of three
children for about half an hour. After she left the room, the staff
responsible for her care posed their questions. “Dr. Rosenberg,” her
psychiatrist began, “please make a differential diagnosis. In your
opinion, is this woman manifesting a schizophrenic reaction or is this a
case of drug-induced psychosis?”</p>
<p>I said that I was uncomfortable with such questions. Even when I
worked in a mental hospital during my training, I was never sure how to
fit people into the diagnostic classifications. Since then I had read
research indicating a lack of agreement among psychiatrists and
psychologists regarding these terms. The reports concluded that
diagnoses of patients in mental hospitals depended more upon the school
the psychiatrist had attended than the characteristics of the patients
themselves.</p>
<p>I would be reluctant, I continued, to apply these terms even if
consistent usage did exist, because I failed to see how they benefited
patients. In physical medicine, pinpointing the disease process that has
created the illness often gives clear direction to its treatment, but I
did not perceive this relationship in the field we call mental illness.
In my experience of case conferences at hospitals, the staff would spend
most of its time deliberating over a diagnosis. As the allotted hour
threatened to run out, the psychiatrist in charge of the case might
appeal to the others for help in setting up a treatment plan. Often this
request would be ignored in favor of continued wrangling over the
diagnosis.</p>
<p>I explained to the psychiatrist that NVC urges me to ask myself the
following questions rather than think in terms of what is wrong with a
patient: “What is this person feeling? What is she or he needing? How am
I feeling in response to this person, and what needs of mine are behind
my feelings? What action or decision would I request this person to take
in the belief that it would enable them to live more happily?” Because
our responses to these questions would reveal a lot about ourselves and
our values, we would feel far more vulnerable than if we were to simply
diagnose the other person.</p>
<p>On another occasion, I was called to demonstrate how NVC could be
taught to people diagnosed as chronic schizophrenics. With about eighty
psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and nurses watching,
fifteen patients who had been thus diagnosed were assembled on the stage
for me. As I introduced myself and explained the purpose of NVC, one of
the patients expressed a reaction that seemed irrelevant to what I was
saying. Aware that he’d been diagnosed as a chronic schizophrenic, I
succumbed to clinical thinking by assuming that my failure to understand
him was due to his confusion. “You seem to have trouble following what
I’m saying,” I remarked.</p>
<p>At this, another patient interjected, “I understand what he’s
saying,” and proceeded to explain the relevance of the first patient’s
words in the context of my introduction. Recognizing that the man was
not confused, but that I had simply not grasped the connection between
our thoughts, I was dismayed by the ease with which I had attributed
responsibility for the breakdown in communication to him. I would have
liked to have owned my own feelings by saying, for example, “I’m
confused. I’d like to see the connection between what I said and your
response, but I don’t. Would you be willing to explain how your words
relate to what I said?”</p>
<p>With the exception of this brief departure into clinical thinking,
the session with the patients went successfully. The staff, impressed
with the patients’ responses, wondered whether I considered them to be
an unusually cooperative group of patients. I answered that when I
avoided diagnosing people and instead stayed connected to the life going
on in them and in myself, people usually responded positively.</p>
<p>A staff member then requested a similar session be conducted, as a
learning experience, with some of the psychologists and psychiatrists as
participants. At this, the patients who had been on stage exchanged
seats with several volunteers in the audience. In working with the
staff, I had a difficult time clarifying to one psychiatrist the
difference between intellectual understanding and the empathy of NVC.
Whenever someone in the group expressed feelings, he would offer his
understanding of the psychological dynamics behind their feelings rather
than empathize with the feelings. When this happened for the third time,
one of the patients in the audience burst out, “Can’t you see you’re
doing it again? You’re interpreting what she’s saying rather than
empathizing with her feelings!”</p>
<p>By adopting the skills and consciousness of NVC, we can counsel
others in encounters that are genuine, open, and mutual, rather than
resort to professional relationships characterized by emotional
distance, diagnosis, and hierarchy.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>NVC enhances inner communication by helping us translate negative
internal messages into feelings and needs. Our ability to distinguish
our own feelings and needs and to empathize with them can free us from
depression. By showing us how to focus on what we truly want rather than
on what is wrong with others or ourselves, NVC gives us the tools and
understanding to create a more peaceful state of mind. Professionals in
counseling and psychotherapy may also use NVC to engender mutual and
authentic relationships with their clients.</p>
<p>NVC in Action</p>
<p>Dealing With Resentment and Self-Judgment</p>
<p>A student of Nonviolent Communication shares the following story.</p>
<p>I had just returned from my first residential training in NVC. A
friend whom I hadn’t seen for two years was waiting for me at home. I
first met Iris, who had been a school librarian for twenty-five years,
during an intense two-week heartwork and wilderness journey that
culminated in a three-day solo fast in the Rockies. After she listened
to my enthusiastic description of NVC, Iris revealed that she was still
hurting from what one of the wilderness leaders in Colorado had said to
her six years before. I had a clear memory of that person: wild-woman
Leav, her palms, gouged with rope cuts, holding steady a belayed body
dangling against the mountain face; she read animal droppings, howled in
the dark, danced her joy, cried her truth, and mooned our bus as we
waved good-bye for the last time. What Iris had heard Leav say during
one of the personal feedback sessions was this:</p>
<p>“Iris, I can’t stand people like you, always and everywhere being so
damn nice and sweet, constantly the meek little librarian that you are.
Why don’t you just drop it and get on with it?”</p>
<p>For six years Iris had been listening to Leav’s voice in her head,
and for six years she’d been answering Leav in her head. We were both
eager to explore how a consciousness of NVC could have affected the
situation. I role-played Leav and repeated her statement to Iris.</p>
<p>Iris: (forgetting about NVC and hearing criticism and put-down) You
have no right to say that to me. You don’t know who I am, or what kind
of librarian I am! I take my profession seriously, and for your
information, I consider myself to be an educator, just like any teacher
…</p>
<p>Me: (with NVC consciousness, listening empathically, as if I were
Leav) It sounds to me like you’re angry because you want me to know and
recognize who you really are before criticizing you. Is that so?</p>
<p>Iris: That’s right! You have simply no idea how much it took for me
to even sign up for this trek. Look! Here I am: I finished, didn’t I? I
took on all the challenges these fourteen days and overcame them
all!</p>
<p>Me: Am I hearing that you feel hurt and would have liked some
recognition and appreciation for all your courage and hard work?</p>
<p>A few more exchanges followed, whereupon Iris showed a shift; these
shifts, when a person feels “heard” to his or her satisfaction, can
often be observed bodily. For instance, a person may relax and take a
deeper breath. This often indicates that the person has received
adequate empathy and is now able to shift attention to something other
than the pain they have been expressing. Sometimes they are ready to
hear another person’s feelings and needs. Or sometimes another round of
empathy is needed to attend to another area of pain. In this situation
with Iris, I could see that another piece needed attention before she
would be able to hear Leav. This is because Iris had had six years of
opportunities to put herself down for not having produced an honorable
comeback on the spot. After the subtle shift, she immediately went
on:</p>
<p>Iris: Darn, I should have said all this stuff to her six years
ago!</p>
<p>Me: (as myself, an empathic friend) You’re frustrated because you
wish you could have articulated yourself better at the time?</p>
<p>Iris: I feel like such an idiot! I knew I wasn’t a “meek little
librarian,” but why didn’t I say that to her?</p>
<p>Me: So you wish you had been enough in touch with yourself to say
that?</p>
<p>Iris: Yes. And I’m also mad at myself! I wish I hadn’t let her push
me around.</p>
<p>Me: You’d like to have been more assertive than you were?</p>
<p>Iris: Exactly. I need to remember I have a right to stand up for who
I am.</p>
<p>Iris was quiet for a few seconds. She expressed readiness to practice
NVC and hear what Leav said to her in a different way.</p>
<p>Me: (as Leav) Iris, I can’t stand people like you, always so nice and
sweet, being forever the meek little librarian. Why don’t you just drop
it and get on with it?</p>
<p>Iris: (listening for Leav’s feelings, needs, and requests) Oh, Leav,
it sounds to me like you’re really frustrated … frustrated because …
because I …</p>
<p>Here Iris catches herself at a common mistake. By using the word I,
she attributes Leav’s feeling to Iris herself, rather than to some
desire on Leav’s own part that generates the feeling. That is, not
“You’re frustrated because I am a certain way,” but “You’re frustrated
because you wanted something different from me.”</p>
<p>Iris: (trying again) Okay, Leav, it sounds like you’re really
frustrated because you are wanting … um … you’re wanting …</p>
<p>As I tried in my role-play to earnestly identify with Leav, I felt a
sudden flash of awareness of what I (as Leav) was yearning for:</p>
<p>Me: (as Leav) Connection! … That’s what I am wanting! I want to feel
connected … with you, Iris! And I am so frustrated with all the
sweetness and niceness that stand in the way that I just want to tear it
all down so I can truly touch you!</p>
<p>We both sat a bit stunned after this outburst, and then Iris said,
“If I had known that’s what she had wanted, if she could have told me
that it was genuine connection with me she was after … Gosh, I mean,
that feels almost loving.” While she never did find the real Leav to
verify the insight, after this practice session in NVC, Iris achieved an
internal resolution about this nagging conflict and found it easier to
hear with a new awareness when people around her said things to her that
she might previously have interpreted as “put-downs.”</p>
<p>… the more you become a connoisseur of gratitude, the less you are a
victim of resentment, depression, and despair. Gratitude will act as an
elixir that will gradually dissolve the hard shell of your ego—your need
to possess and control—and transform you into a generous being. The
sense of gratitude produces true spiritual alchemy, makes us
magnanimous—large souled.</p>
