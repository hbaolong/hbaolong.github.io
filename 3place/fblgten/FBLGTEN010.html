<h4 id="connecting-compassionately-with-ourselves">Connecting
Compassionately With Ourselves</h4>
<p>Let us become the change we seek in the world.</p>
<p>—Mahatma Gandhi</p>
<p>We have seen how NVC contributes to relationships with friends and
family, at work and in the political arena. Its most crucial
application, however, may be in the way we treat ourselves. When we are
internally violent toward ourselves, it is difficult to be genuinely
compassionate toward others.</p>
<p>NVC’s most important use may be in developing self-compassion.</p>
<h5 id="remembering-the-specialness-of-what-we-are">Remembering the
Specialness of What We Are</h5>
<p>In the play A Thousand Clowns by Herb Gardner, the protagonist
refuses to release his twelve-year-old nephew to child-welfare
authorities, declaring, “I want him to get to know exactly the special
thing he is or else he won’t notice it when it starts to go. I want him
to stay awake … I want to be sure he sees all the wild possibilities. I
want him to know it’s worth all the trouble just to give the world a
little goosing when you get the chance. And I want him to know the
subtle, sneaky, important reason why he was born a human being and not a
chair.”</p>
<p>I am gravely concerned that many of us have lost awareness of “the
special thing” we are; we have forgotten the “subtle, sneaky, important
reason” the uncle so passionately wanted his nephew to know. When
critical self-concepts prevent us from seeing the beauty in ourselves,
we lose connection with the divine energy that is our source.
Conditioned to view ourselves as objects-objects full of shortcomings—is
it any wonder that many of us end up relating violently to
ourselves?</p>
<p>An important area where this violence can be replaced with compassion
is in our moment-to-moment evaluation of ourselves. Since we want
whatever we do to lead to the enrichment of life, it is critical to know
how to evaluate events and conditions in ways that help us learn and
make ongoing choices that serve us. Unfortunately, the way we’ve been
trained to evaluate ourselves often promotes more self-hatred than
learning.</p>
<p>We use NVC to evaluate ourselves in ways that engender growth rather
than self-hatred.</p>
<h5
id="evaluating-ourselves-when-weve-been-less-than-perfect">Evaluating
Ourselves When We’ve Been Less Than Perfect</h5>
<p>In a routine workshop activity, I ask participants to recall a recent
occasion when they did something they wish they hadn’t. We then look at
how they spoke to themselves immediately after having made what is
referred in common language as a “mistake” or “error.” Typical
statements were: “That was dumb!” “How could you do such a stupid
thing?” “What’s wrong with you?” “You’re always messing up!” “That’s
selfish!”</p>
<p>These speakers had been taught to judge themselves in ways that imply
that what they did was wrong or bad; their self-admonishment implicitly
assumes that they deserve to suffer for what they’ve done. It is tragic
that so many of us get enmeshed in self-hatred rather than benefit from
our mistakes, which show us our limitations and guide us towards
growth.</p>
<p>Even when we sometimes do “learn a lesson” from mistakes for which we
judge ourselves harshly, I worry about the nature of the energy behind
that kind of change and learning. I’d like change to be stimulated by a
clear desire to enrich life for ourselves or for others rather than by
destructive energies such as shame or guilt.</p>
<p>If the way we evaluate ourselves leads us to feel shame, and we
consequently change our behavior, we are allowing our growing and
learning to be guided by self-hatred. Shame is a form of self-hatred,
and actions taken in reaction to shame are not free and joyful acts.
Even if our intention is to behave with more kindness and sensitivity,
if people sense shame or guilt behind our actions, they are less likely
to appreciate what we do than if we are motivated purely by the human
desire to contribute to life.</p>
<p>In our language there is a word with enormous power to create shame
and guilt. This violent word, which we commonly use to evaluate
ourselves, is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that many of us
would have trouble imagining how to live without it. It is the word
should, as in “I should have known better” or “I shouldn’t have done
that.” Most of the time when we use this word with ourselves, we resist
learning, because should implies that there is no choice. Human beings,
when hearing any kind of demand, tend to resist because it threatens our
autonomy—our strong need for choice. We have this reaction to tyranny
even when it’s internal tyranny in the form of a should.</p>
<p>Avoid shoulding yourself!</p>
<p>A similar expression of internal demand occurs in the following
self-evaluation: “What I’m doing is just terrible. I really must do
something about it!” Think for a moment of all the people you’ve heard
say, “I really should give up smoking,” or, “I really have to do
something about exercising more.” They keep saying what they “must” do
and they keep resisting doing it, because human beings were not meant to
be slaves. We were not meant to succumb to the dictates of should and
have to, whether they come from outside or inside of ourselves. And if
we do yield and submit to these demands, our actions arise from an
energy that is devoid of life-giving joy.</p>
<h5 id="translating-self-judgments-and-inner-demands">Translating
Self-Judgments and Inner Demands</h5>
<p>When we communicate with ourselves on a regular basis through inner
judgment, blame, and demand, it’s not surprising that our self-concept
gives in to feeling more like a chair than a human being. A basic
premise of NVC is that whenever we imply that someone is wrong or bad,
what we are really saying is that he or she is not acting in harmony
with our needs. If the person we are judging happens to be ourselves,
what we are saying is, “I myself am not behaving in harmony with my own
needs.” I am convinced that if we learn to evaluate ourselves in terms
of whether and how well our needs are being fulfilled, we are much more
likely to learn from the evaluation.</p>
<p>Our challenge then, when we are doing something that is not enriching
life, is to evaluate ourselves moment by moment in a way that inspires
change both (1) in the direction of where we would like to go, and (2)
out of respect and compassion for ourselves, rather than out of
self-hatred, guilt or shame.</p>
<p>Self-judgments, like all judgments, are tragic expressions of unmet
needs.</p>
<h5 id="nvc-mourning">NVC Mourning</h5>
<p>After a lifetime of schooling and socialization, it is probably too
late for most of us to train our minds to think purely in terms of what
we need and value from moment to moment. However, just as we have
learned to translate judgments when conversing with others, we can train
ourselves to recognize judgmental self-talk and to immediately focus our
attention on the underlying needs.</p>
<p>For example, if we find ourselves reacting reproachfully to something
we did (“Look, you just messed up again!”), we can quickly stop and ask
ourselves, “What unmet need of mine is being expressed through this
moralistic judgment?” When we do connect to the need—and there may be
several layers of needs—we will notice a remarkable shift in our bodies.
Instead of the shame, guilt, or depression we likely feel when
criticizing ourselves for having “messed up again,” we will experience
any number of other feelings. Whether it’s sadness, frustration,
disappointment, fear, grief, or some other feeling, we have been endowed
by nature with these feelings for a purpose: they mobilize us to pursue
and fulfill what we need or value. The impact of these feelings on our
spirit and bodies is substantially different from the disconnection that
is brought on by guilt, shame, and depression.</p>
<p>Mourning in NVC is the process of fully connecting with the unmet
needs and the feelings that are generated when we have been less than
perfect. It is an experience of regret, but regret that helps us learn
from what we have done without blaming or hating ourselves. We see how
our behavior ran counter to our own needs and values, and we open
ourselves to feelings that arise out of that awareness. When our
consciousness is focused on what we need, we are naturally stimulated
toward creative possibilities for how to get that need met. In contrast,
the moralistic judgments we use when blaming ourselves tend to obscure
such possibilities and to perpetuate a state of self-punishment.</p>
<p>NVC mourning: connecting with the feelings and unmet needs stimulated
by past actions we now regret.</p>
<h5 id="self-forgiveness">Self-Forgiveness</h5>
<p>We follow up on the process of mourning with self-forgiveness.
Turning our attention to the part of the self which chose to act in the
way that led to the present situation, we ask ourselves, “When I behaved
in the way which I now regret, what need of mine was I trying to meet?”
I believe that human beings are always acting in the service of needs
and values. This is true whether the action does or does not meet the
need, or whether it’s one we end up celebrating or regretting.</p>
<p>When we listen empathically to ourselves, we will be able to hear the
underlying need. Self-forgiveness occurs the moment this empathic
connection is made. Then we are able to recognize how our choice was an
attempt to serve life, even as the mourning process teaches us how it
fell short of fulfilling our needs.</p>
<p>An important aspect of self-compassion is to be able to empathically
hold both parts of ourselves—the self that regrets a past action and the
self that took the action in the first place. The process of mourning
and self-forgiveness frees us in the direction of learning and growing.
In connecting moment by moment to our needs, we increase our creative
capacity to act in harmony with them.</p>
<p>NVC self-forgiveness: connecting with the need we were trying to meet
when we took the action that we now regret.</p>
<h5 id="the-lesson-of-the-polka-dotted-suit">The Lesson of the
Polka-Dotted Suit</h5>
<p>I would like to illustrate the process of mourning and
self-forgiveness by recalling a personal event. The day before an
important workshop, I had bought a light gray summer suit to wear. At
the end of the well-attended workshop, I was swarmed by participants
asking for my signature, address, and other information. With time
closing in on another appointment, I hastened to attend to the requests
of the participants, signing and scribbling on the many bits of paper
thrust in front of me. As I rushed out the door, I stuck my
pen—uncapped—in the pocket of my new suit. Once outside, I discovered to
my horror that instead of the nice light gray suit, I now had a
polka-dotted suit!</p>
<p>For twenty minutes I was brutal with myself: “How could you be so
careless? What a stupid thing to do!” I had just ruined a brand-new
suit: if ever I needed compassion and understanding, this was the time,
yet there I was responding to myself in a way that left me feeling worse
than ever.</p>
<p>Fortunately—after only twenty minutes—I noticed what I was doing. I
stopped, looked for the need of mine that was unmet by having left the
pen uncapped, and asked myself, “What need lies behind my judging myself
as ‘careless’ and ‘stupid?’”</p>
<p>Immediately I saw that it was to take better care of myself: to have
given more attention to my own needs while I was rushing to address
everyone else’s needs. As soon as I touched that part of myself and
connected to the deep longing to be more aware and caring of my own
needs, my feelings shifted. There was a release of tension in my body as
the anger, shame, and guilt I was harboring toward myself dissipated. I
fully mourned the ruined suit and uncapped pen as I opened to feelings
of sadness arising along with the yearning to take better care of
myself.</p>
<p>Next I shifted my attention to the need I was meeting when I slipped
the uncapped pen into my pocket. I recognized how much I valued care and
consideration for other people’s needs. Of course, in taking such good
care of other people’s needs, I had not taken the time to do the same
for myself. But instead of blame, I felt a wave of compassion for myself
as I realized that even my rushing and putting the pen away unthinkingly
had come out of serving my own need to respond to others in a caring
way!</p>
<p>We are compassionate with ourselves when we are able to embrace all
parts of ourselves and recognize the needs and values expressed by each
part.</p>
<p>In that compassionate place, I am able to hold both needs: in one
hand, to respond in a caring way to others’ needs, and in the other, to
be aware of and take better care of my own needs. On becoming conscious
of both needs, I can imagine ways of behaving differently in similar
situations and arriving at solutions more resourcefully than if I lose
that consciousness in a sea of self-judgment.</p>
<h5 id="dont-do-anything-that-isnt-play">Don’t Do Anything That Isn’t
Play!</h5>
<p>In addition to the process of mourning and self-forgiveness, another
aspect of self-compassion I emphasize is in the energy that’s behind
whatever action we take. When I advise, “Don’t do anything that isn’t
play!” some take me to be radical, even insane. I earnestly believe,
however, that an important form of self-compassion is to make choices
motivated purely by our desire to contribute to life rather than out of
fear, guilt, shame, duty, or obligation. When we are conscious of the
life-enriching purpose behind an action we take, when the sole energy
that motivates us is simply to make life wonderful for others and
ourselves, then even hard work has an element of play in it.
Correspondingly, an otherwise joyful activity performed out of
obligation, duty, fear, guilt, or shame will lose its joy and eventually
engender resistance.</p>
<p>We want to take action out of the desire to contribute to life rather
than out of fear, guilt, shame, or obligation.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, we considered replacing language that implies lack of
choice with language that acknowledges choice. Many years ago I began to
engage in an activity which significantly enlarged the pool of joy and
happiness available to my life, while diminishing depression, guilt, and
shame. I offer it here as a possible way to deepen our compassion for
ourselves, to help us live our lives out of joyous play by staying
grounded in a clear awareness of the life-enriching need behind
everything we do.</p>
<h5 id="translating-have-to-to-choose-to">Translating “Have to” to
“Choose to”</h5>
<p>Step 1</p>
<p>What do you do in your life that you don’t experience as playful?
List on a piece of paper all those things that you tell yourself you
have to do. List any activity you dread but do anyway because you
perceive yourself to have no choice.</p>
<p>When I first reviewed my own list, just seeing how long it was gave
me insight as to why so much of my time was spent not enjoying life. I
noticed how many ordinary, daily things I was doing by tricking myself
into believing that I had to do them.</p>
<p>The first item on my list was “write clinical reports.” I hated
writing these reports, yet I was spending at least an hour of agony over
them every day. My second item was “drive the children’s car pool to
school.”</p>
<p>Step 2</p>
<p>After completing your list, clearly acknowledge to yourself that you
are doing these things because you choose to do them, not because you
have to. Insert the words “I choose to … “ in front of each item you
listed.</p>
<p>I recall my own resistance to this step. “Writing clinical reports,”
I insisted to myself, “is not something I choose to do! I have to do it.
I’m a clinical psychologist. I have to write these reports.”</p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>After having acknowledged that you choose to do a particular
activity, get in touch with the intention behind your choice by
completing the statement, I choose to … because I want ….</p>
<p>At first I fumbled to identify what I wanted from writing clinical
reports. I had already determined, several months earlier, that the
reports did not serve my clients enough to justify the time they were
taking, so why was I continuing to invest so much energy in their
preparation? Finally I realized that I was choosing to write the reports
solely because I wanted the income they provided. As soon as I
recognized this, I never wrote another clinical report. I can’t tell you
how joyful I feel just thinking of how many clinical reports I haven’t
written since that moment thirty-five years ago! When I realized that
money was my primary motivation, I immediately saw that I could find
other ways to take care of myself financially, and that in fact, I’d
rather scavenge in garbage cans for food than write another clinical
report.</p>
<p>The next item on my list of unjoyful tasks was driving the children
to school. When I examined the reason behind that chore, however, I felt
appreciation for the benefits my children received from attending their
school. They could easily walk to the neighborhood school, but their own
school was far more in harmony with my educational values. I continued
to drive, but with a different energy; instead of “Oh, darn, I have to
drive the car pool today,” I was conscious of my purpose, which was for
my children to have a quality of education that was very dear to me. Of
course I sometimes needed to remind myself two or three times during the
drive to refocus my mind on what purpose my action was serving.</p>
<p>With every choice you make, be conscious of what need it serves.</p>
<h5
id="cultivating-awareness-of-the-energy-behind-our-actions">Cultivating
Awareness of the Energy Behind Our Actions</h5>
<p>As you explore the statement, “I choose to … because I want … ,” you
may discover—as I did with the children’s car pool—the important values
behind the choices you’ve made. I am convinced that after we gain
clarity regarding the need being served by our actions, we can
experience those actions as play even when they involve hard work,
challenge, or frustration.</p>
<p>For some items on your list, however, you might uncover one or
several of the following motivations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>FOR MONEY</li>
</ol>
<p>Money is a major form of extrinsic reward in our society. Choices
prompted by a desire for reward are costly: they deprive us of the joy
in life that comes with actions grounded in the clear intention to
contribute to a human need. Money is not a “need” as we define it in
NVC; it is one of countless strategies that may be selected to address a
need.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>FOR APPROVAL</li>
</ol>
<p>Like money, approval from others is a form of extrinsic reward. Our
culture has educated us to hunger for reward. We attended schools that
used extrinsic means to motivate us to study; we grew up in homes where
we were rewarded for being good little boys and girls, and were punished
when our caretakers judged us to be otherwise. Thus, as adults, we
easily trick ourselves into believing that life consists of doing things
for reward; we are addicted to getting a smile, a pat on the back, and
people’s verbal judgments that we are a “good person,” “good parent,”
“good citizen,” “good worker,” “good friend,” and so forth. We do things
to get people to like us and avoid things that may lead people to
dislike or punish us.</p>
<p>I find it tragic that we work so hard to buy love and assume that we
must deny ourselves and do for others in order to be liked. In fact,
when we do things solely in the spirit of enhancing life, we will find
others appreciating us. Their appreciation, however, is only a feedback
mechanism confirming that our efforts had the intended effect. The
recognition that we have chosen to use our power to serve life and have
done so successfully brings us the genuine joy of celebrating ourselves
in a way that approval from others can never offer.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>TO ESCAPE PUNISHMENT</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of us pay income tax primarily to avoid punishment. As a
consequence, we are likely to approach that yearly ritual with a degree
of resentment. I recall, however, from my childhood how differently my
father and grandfather felt about paying taxes. They had immigrated to
the United States from Russia and were desirous of supporting a
government they believed was protecting people in a way that the czar
had not. Imagining the many people whose welfare was being served by
their tax money, they felt earnest pleasure as they sent their checks to
the U.S. government.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>TO AVOID SHAME</li>
</ol>
<p>There may be some tasks we choose to do just to avoid shame. We know
that if we don’t do them, we’ll end up suffering severe self-judgment,
hearing our own voice telling us there is something wrong or stupid
about us. If we do something stimulated solely by the urge to avoid
shame, we will generally end up detesting it.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>TO AVOID GUILT</li>
</ol>
<p>In other instances, we may think, “If I don’t do this, people will be
disappointed in me.” We are afraid we’ll end up feeling guilty for
failing to fulfill other people’s expectations of us. There is a world
of difference between doing something for others in order to avoid guilt
and doing it out of a clear awareness of our own need to contribute to
the happiness of other human beings. The first is a world filled with
misery; the second is a world filled with play.</p>
<p>Be conscious of actions motivated by the desire for money or
approval, and by fear, shame, or guilt. Know the price you pay for
them.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>TO SATISFY A SENSE OF DUTY</li>
</ol>
<p>When we use language which denies choice (for example, words such as
should, have to, ought, must, can’t, supposed to, etc.), our behaviors
arise out of a vague sense of guilt, duty, or obligation. I consider
this to be the most socially dangerous and personally unfortunate of all
the ways we act when we’re cut off from our needs.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2 we saw how the concept of Amtssprache allowed Adolf
Eichmann and his colleagues to send tens of thousands of people to their
deaths without feeling emotionally affected or personally responsible.
When we speak a language that denies choice, we forfeit the life in
ourselves for a robotlike mentality that disconnects us from our own
core.</p>
<p>The most dangerous of all behaviors may consist of doing things
“because we’re supposed to.”</p>
<p>After examining the list of items you have generated, you may decide
to stop doing certain things in the same spirit that I chose to forego
writing clinical reports. As radical as it may seem, it is possible to
do things only out of play. I believe that to the degree that we engage
moment by moment in the playfulness of enriching life—motivated solely
by the desire for enriching life—to that degree are we being
compassionate with ourselves.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>The most crucial application of NVC may be in the way we treat
ourselves. When we make mistakes, instead of getting caught up in
moralistic self-judgments, we can use the process of NVC mourning and
self-forgiveness to show us where we can grow. By assessing our
behaviors in terms of our own unmet needs, the impetus for change comes
not out of shame, guilt, anger, or depression, but out of the genuine
desire to contribute to our own and others’ well-being.</p>
<p>We also cultivate self-compassion by consciously choosing in daily
life to act only in service to our own needs and values rather than out
of duty, for extrinsic rewards, or to avoid guilt, shame, and
punishment. If we review the joyless acts to which we currently subject
ourselves and make the translation from “have to” to “choose to,” we
will discover more play and integrity in our lives.</p>
