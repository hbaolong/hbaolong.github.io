<h4 id="expressing-appreciation-in-nonviolent-communication">Expressing
Appreciation in Nonviolent Communication</h4>
<h5 id="the-intention-behind-the-appreciation">The Intention Behind the
Appreciation</h5>
<p>“You did a good job on that report.”</p>
<p>“You are a very sensitive person.”</p>
<p>“It was kind of you to offer me a ride home last evening.”</p>
<p>Such statements are typically uttered as expressions of appreciation
in life-alienating communication. Perhaps you are surprised that I
regard praise and compliments to be life-alienating. Notice, however,
that appreciation expressed in this form reveals little of what’s going
on in the speaker; it establishes the speaker as someone who sits in
judgment. I define judgments—both positive and negative—as
life-alienating communication.</p>
<p>Compliments are often judgments—however positive-of others.</p>
<p>In corporate trainings, I often encounter managers who defend the
practice of praising and complimenting by claiming that “it works.”
“Research shows,” they assert, “that if a manager compliments employees,
they work harder. And the same goes for schools: if teachers praise
students, they study harder.” I have reviewed this research, and my
belief is that recipients of such praise do work harder, but only
initially. Once they sense the manipulation behind the appreciation,
their productivity drops. What is most disturbing for me, however, is
that the beauty of appreciation is spoiled when people begin to notice
the lurking intent to get something out of them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we use positive feedback as a means to influence
others, it may not be clear how they are receiving the message. There is
a cartoon where one Native American remarks to another, “Watch me use
modern psychology on my horse!” He then leads his friend to where the
horse can overhear their conversation and exclaims, “I have the fastest,
most courageous horse in all the West!” The horse looks sad and says to
itself, “How do you like that? He’s gone and bought himself another
horse.”</p>
<p>When we use NVC to express appreciation, it is purely to celebrate,
not to get something in return. Our sole intention is to celebrate the
way our lives have been enriched by others.</p>
<p>Express appreciation to celebrate, not to manipulate.</p>
<h5 id="the-three-components-of-appreciation">The Three Components of
Appreciation</h5>
<p>NVC clearly distinguishes three components in the expression of
appreciation:</p>
<p>the actions that have contributed to our well-being</p>
<p>the particular needs of ours that have been fulfilled</p>
<p>the pleasureful feelings engendered by the fulfillment of those
needs</p>
<p>The sequence of these ingredients may vary; sometimes all three can
be conveyed by a smile or a simple “Thank you.” However, if we want to
ensure that our appreciation has been fully received, it is valuable to
develop the eloquence to express all three components verbally. The
following dialogue illustrates how praise may be transformed into an
appreciation that embraces all three components.</p>
<p>Saying “thank you” in NVC: “This is what you did; this is what I
feel; this is the need of mine that was met.”</p>
<p>Participant: (approaching me after a workshop) Marshall, you’re
brilliant!</p>
<p>MBR: I’m not able to get as much out of your appreciation as I would
like.</p>
<p>Participant: Why, what do you mean?</p>
<p>MBR: In my lifetime I’ve been called a multitude of names, yet I
can’t recall seriously learning anything by being told what I am. I’d
like to learn from your appreciation and enjoy it, but I would need more
information.</p>
<p>Participant: Like what?</p>
<p>MBR: First, I’d like to know what I said or did that made life more
wonderful for you.</p>
<p>Participant: Well, you’re so intelligent.</p>
<p>MBR: I’m afraid you’ve just given me another judgment that still
leaves me wondering what I did that made life more wonderful for
you.</p>
<p>Participant: (thinks for a while, then points to notes she had taken
during the workshop) Look at these two places. It was these two things
you said.</p>
<p>MBR: Ah, so it’s my saying those two things that you appreciate.</p>
<p>Participant: Yes.</p>
<p>MBR: Next, I’d like to know how you feel in conjunction to my having
said those two things.</p>
<p>Participant: Hopeful and relieved.</p>
<p>MBR: And now I’d like to know what needs of yours were fulfilled by
my saying those two things.</p>
<p>Participant: I have this eighteen-year-old son whom I haven’t been
able to communicate with. I’d been desperately searching for some
direction that might help me to relate with him in a more loving manner,
and those two things you said provide the direction I was looking
for.</p>
<p>Hearing all three pieces of information—what I did, how she felt, and
what needs of hers were fulfilled—I could then celebrate the
appreciation with her. Had she initially expressed her appreciation in
NVC, it might have sounded like this: “Marshall, when you said these two
things (showing me her notes), I felt very hopeful and relieved, because
I’ve been searching for a way to make a connection with my son, and
these gave me the direction I was looking for.”</p>
<h5 id="receiving-appreciation">Receiving Appreciation</h5>
<p>For many of us, it is difficult to receive appreciation gracefully.
We fret over whether we deserve it. We worry about what’s being expected
of us—especially if we have teachers or managers who use appreciation as
a means to spur productivity. Or we’re nervous about living up to the
appreciation. Accustomed to a culture where buying, earning, and
deserving are the standard modes of interchange, we are often
uncomfortable with simple giving and receiving.</p>
<p>NVC encourages us to receive appreciation with the same quality of
empathy we express when listening to other messages. We hear what we
have done that has contributed to others’ well-being; we hear their
feelings and the needs that were fulfilled. We take into our hearts the
joyous reality that we can each enhance the quality of others’
lives.</p>
<p>I was taught to receive appreciation with grace by my friend Nafez
Assailey. He was a member of a Palestinian team whom I had invited to
Switzerland for training in NVC at a time when security precautions made
training of mixed groups of Palestinians and Israelis impossible in
either of their own countries. At the end of the workshop, Nafez came up
to me. “This training will be very valuable for us in working for peace
in our country,” he acknowledged. “I would like to thank you in a way
that we Sufi Muslims do when we want to express special appreciation for
something.” Locking his thumb onto mine, he looked me in the eye and
said, “I kiss the God in you that allows you to give us what you did.”
He then kissed my hand.</p>
<p>Nafez’s expression of gratitude showed me a different way to receive
appreciation. Usually it is received from one of two polar positions. At
one end is egotism, believing ourselves to be superior because we’ve
been appreciated. At the other extreme is false humility, denying the
importance of the appreciation by shrugging it off: “Oh, it was
nothing.” Nafez showed me that I could receive appreciation joyfully, in
the awareness that God has given everyone the power to enrich the lives
of others. If I am aware that it is this power of God working through me
that gives me the power to enrich life for others, then I may avoid both
the ego trap and the false humility.</p>
<p>Receive appreciation without feelings of superiority or false
humility.</p>
<p>Golda Meir, when she was the Israeli prime minister, once chided one
of her ministers: “Don’t be so humble, you’re not that great.” The
following lines, attributed to contemporary writer Marianne Williamson,
serve as another reminder for me to avoid the pitfall of false
humility:</p>
<p>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is
that we are powerful beyond measure.</p>
<p>It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us. You are a child
of God. Your playing small doesn’t serve the world.</p>
<p>There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people
won’t feel insecure around you.</p>
<p>We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
It’s not just in some of us, it is in everyone.</p>
<p>And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people
permission to do the same.</p>
<p>As we are liberated from our fear, our presence automatically
liberates others.</p>
<h5 id="the-hunger-for-appreciation">The Hunger for Appreciation</h5>
<p>Paradoxically, despite our unease in receiving appreciation, most of
us yearn to be genuinely recognized and appreciated. During a surprise
party for me, a twelve-year-old friend of mine suggested a party game to
help introduce the guests to each other. We were to write down a
question, drop it in a box, and then take turns, each person drawing out
a question and responding to it out loud.</p>
<p>Having recently consulted with various social service agencies and
industrial organizations, I was feeling struck by how often people
expressed a hunger for appreciation on the job. “No matter how hard you
work,” they would sigh, “you never hear a good word from anyone. But
make one mistake and there’s always someone jumping all over you.” So
for the game, I wrote this question: “What appreciation might someone
give you that would leave you jumping for joy?”</p>
<p>A woman drew that question out of the box, read it, and started to
cry. As director of a shelter for battered women, she would put
considerable energy each month into creating a schedule to please as
many people as possible. Yet each time the schedule was presented, at
least a couple of individuals would complain. She couldn’t remember ever
receiving appreciation for her efforts to design a fair schedule. All
this had flashed through her mind as she read my question, and the
hunger for appreciation brought tears to her eyes.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the woman’s story, another friend of mine said that he,
too, would like to answer the question. Everyone else then requested a
turn; as they responded to the question, several people wept.</p>
<p>While the craving for appreciation—as opposed to manipulative
“strokes”—is particularly evident in the workplace, it affects family
life as well. One evening when I pointed out his failure to perform a
house chore, my son Brett retorted, “Dad, are you aware how often you
bring up what’s gone wrong but almost never bring up what’s gone right?”
His observation stayed with me. I realized how I was continually
searching for improvements, while barely stopping to celebrate things
that were going well. I had just completed a workshop with more than a
hundred participants, all of whom had evaluated it very highly, with the
exception of one person. However, what lingered in my mind was that one
person’s dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>We tend to notice what’s wrong rather than what’s right.</p>
<p>That evening I wrote a song that began like this:</p>
<p>If I’m ninety-eight percent perfect</p>
<p>in anything I do,</p>
<p>it’s the two percent I’ve messed up</p>
<p>I’ll remember when I’m through.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that I had a choice to adopt instead the outlook of
a teacher I knew. One of her students, having neglected to study for an
exam, had resigned himself to turning in a blank piece of paper with his
name at the top. He was surprised when she later returned the test to
him with a grade of 14 percent. “What did I get 14 percent for?” he
asked incredulously. “Neatness,” she replied. Ever since hearing my son
Brett’s wake-up call, I’ve tried to be more aware of what others around
me are doing that enriches my life, and to hone my skills in expressing
this appreciation.</p>
<h5 id="overcoming-the-reluctance-to-express-appreciation">Overcoming
the Reluctance to Express Appreciation</h5>
<p>I was deeply touched by a passage in John Powell’s book The Secret of
Staying in Love, in which Powell describes his sadness over having been
unable, during his father’s lifetime, to express the appreciation he
felt for his father to his father. How grievous it seemed to me to miss
the chance of appreciating the people who have been the greatest
positive influences in our lives!</p>
<p>Immediately an uncle of mine, Julius Fox, came to mind. When I was a
boy, he came daily to offer nursing care to my grandmother, who was
totally paralyzed. While he cared for my grandmother, he always had a
warm and loving smile on his face. No matter how unpleasant the task may
have appeared to my boyish eyes, he treated her as if she were doing him
the greatest favor in the world by letting him care for her. This
provided a wonderful model of masculine strength for me—one that I’ve
often called upon in the years since.</p>
<p>I realized that I had never expressed my appreciation for my uncle,
who himself was now ill and near death. I considered doing so, but
sensed my own resistance: “I’m sure he already knows how much he means
to me, I don’t need to express it out loud; besides, it might embarrass
him if I put it into words.” As soon as these thoughts entered my head,
I already knew they weren’t true. Too often I had assumed that others
knew the intensity of my appreciation for them, only to discover
otherwise. And even when people were embarrassed, they still wanted to
hear appreciation verbalized.</p>
<p>Still hesitant, I told myself that words couldn’t do justice to the
depth of what I wished to communicate. I quickly saw through that one,
though: yes, words may be poor vehicles in conveying our heartfelt
realities, but as I have learned, “Anything that is worth doing is worth
doing poorly!”</p>
<p>As it happened, I soon found myself seated next to Uncle Julius at a
family gathering, and the words simply flowed out of me. He took them in
joyfully, without embarrassment. Brimming over with feelings from the
evening, I went home, composed a poem and sent it to him. I was later
told that each day until he died three weeks later, my uncle had asked
that the poem be read to him.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Conventional compliments often take the form of judgments, however
positive, and are sometimes intended to manipulate the behavior of
others. NVC encourages the expression of appreciation solely for
celebration. We state (1) the action that has contributed to our
well-being, (2) the particular need of ours that has been fulfilled, and
(3) the feelings of pleasure engendered as a result.</p>
<p>When we receive appreciation expressed in this way, we can do so
without any feeling of superiority or false humility—instead we can
celebrate along with the person who is offering the appreciation.</p>
<h5 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h5>
<p>I once asked my uncle Julius how he had developed such a remarkable
capacity to give compassionately. He seemed honored by my question,
which he pondered before replying, “I’ve been blessed with good
teachers.” When I asked who these were, he recalled, “Your grandmother
was the best teacher I had. You lived with her when she was already ill,
so you didn’t know what she was really like. For example, did your
mother ever tell you about the time during the Depression when your
grandmother brought a tailor and his wife and two children to live with
her for three years, after he lost his house and business?” I remembered
the story well. It had left a deep impression when my mother first told
it to me because I could never figure out where grandmother had found
space for the tailor’s family when she was raising nine children of her
own in a modest-sized house!</p>
<p>Uncle Julius recollected my grandmother’s compassion in a few more
anecdotes, all of which I had heard as a child. Then he asked, “Surely
your mother told you about Jesus.”</p>
<p>“About who?”</p>
<p>“Jesus.”</p>
<p>“No, she never told me about Jesus.”</p>
<p>The story about Jesus was the final precious gift I received from my
uncle before he died. It’s a true story of a time when a man came to my
grandmother’s back door asking for some food. This wasn’t unusual.
Although grandmother was very poor, the entire neighborhood knew that
she would feed anyone who showed up at her door. This man had a beard
and wild, scraggly black hair; his clothes were ragged, and he wore a
cross around his neck fashioned out of branches tied with rope. My
grandmother invited him into her kitchen for some food, and while he was
eating she asked his name.</p>
<p>“My name is Jesus,” he replied.</p>
<p>“Do you have a last name?” she inquired.</p>
<p>“I am Jesus the Lord.” (My grandmother’s English wasn’t too good.
Another uncle, Isidor, later told me he had come into the kitchen while
the man was still eating, and grandmother had introduced the stranger as
Mr. Thelord.)</p>
<p>As the man continued to eat, my grandmother asked where he lived.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a home.”</p>
<p>“Well, where are you going to stay tonight? It’s cold.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Would you like to stay here?” she offered.</p>
<p>He stayed seven years.</p>
<p>When it came to communicating nonviolently, my grandmother was a
natural. She didn’t think of what this man “was.” If she had, she
probably would have judged him as crazy and gotten rid of him. No, she
thought in terms of what people feel and what they need. If they’re
hungry, feed them. If they’re without a roof over their head, give them
a place to sleep.</p>
<p>My grandmother loved to dance, and my mother remembers her saying
often, “Never walk when you can dance.” And thus I end this book on a
language of compassion with a song about my grandmother, who spoke and
lived the language of Nonviolent Communication.</p>
<p>One day a man named Jesus</p>
<p>came around to my grandmother’s door.</p>
<p>He asked for a little food,</p>
<p>she gave him more.</p>
<p>He said he was Jesus the Lord;</p>
<p>she didn’t check him out with Rome.</p>
<p>He stayed for several years,</p>
<p>as did many without a home.</p>
<p>It was in her Jewish way,</p>
<p>she taught me what Jesus had to say.</p>
<p>In that precious way,</p>
<p>she taught me what Jesus had to say.</p>
<p>And that’s: “Feed the hungry, heal the sick,</p>
<p>then take a rest.</p>
<p>Never walk when you can dance;</p>
<p>make your home a cozy nest.”</p>
<p>It was in her Jewish way,</p>
<p>she taught me what Jesus had to say.</p>
<p>In her precious way,</p>
<p>she taught me what Jesus had to say.</p>

<h5 id="about-nonviolent-communication">About Nonviolent
Communication</h5>
<p>Nonviolent Communication has flourished for more than four decades
across sixty countries selling more than 1,000,000 books in over thirty
languages for one simple reason: it works.</p>
<p>From the bedroom to the boardroom, from the classroom to the war
zone, Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is changing lives every day. NVC
provides an easy-to-grasp, effective method to get to the root of
violence and pain peacefully. By examining the unmet needs behind what
we do and say, NVC helps reduce hostility, heal pain, and strengthen
professional and personal relationships. NVC is now being taught in
corporations, classrooms, prisons, and mediation centers worldwide. And
it is affecting cultural shifts as institutions, corporations, and
governments integrate NVC consciousness into their organizational
structures and their approach to leadership.</p>
<p>Most of us are hungry for skills that can improve the quality of our
relationships, to deepen our sense of personal empowerment or simply
help us communicate more effectively. Unfortunately, most of us have
been educated from birth to compete, judge, demand, and diagnose; to
think and communicate in terms of what is “right” and “wrong” with
people. At best, the habitual ways we think and speak hinder
communication and create misunderstanding or frustration. And still
worse, they can cause anger and pain, and may lead to violence. Without
wanting to, even people with the best of intentions generate needless
conflict.</p>
<p>NVC helps us reach beneath the surface and discover what is alive and
vital within us, and how all of our actions are based on human needs
that we are seeking to meet. We learn to develop a vocabulary of
feelings and needs that helps us more clearly express what is going on
in us at any given moment. When we understand and acknowledge our needs,
we develop a shared foundation for much more satisfying relationships.
Join the thousands of people worldwide who have improved their
relationships and their lives with this simple yet revolutionary
process.</p>

cycles of overconsumption or emotional eating?</p>
<p>Using the consciousness of Nonviolent Communication, Eat by Choice
helps you dig deeper into the emotional consciousness that underlies
your eating patterns. Much more than a prescriptive fad diet, you’ll
learn practical strategies to develop a healthier relationship with
food. Learn to enjoy the tastes, smells, and sensations of healthful
eating once again.</p>

<p>Dr. Rosenberg first used the NVC process in federally funded school

supporters teaching NVC in more than sixty countries around the
globe.</p>
<p>A sought-after presenter, peacemaker and visionary leader,
Dr. Rosenberg led NVC workshops and international intensive trainings
for tens of thousands of people in over 60 countries across the world
and provided training and initiated peace programs in many war-torn
areas including Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and the Middle East. He worked
tirelessly with educators, managers, health care providers, lawyers,
military officers, prisoners, police and prison officials, government
officials, and individual families. With guitar and puppets in hand and
a spiritual energy that filled a room, Marshall showed us how to create
a more peaceful and satisfying world.</p>
