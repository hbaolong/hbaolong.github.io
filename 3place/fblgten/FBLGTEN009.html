<h4 id="the-power-of-empathy">The Power of Empathy</h4>
<h5 id="empathy-that-heals">Empathy That Heals</h5>
<p>Carl Rogers described the impact of empathy on its recipients: “When
… someone really hears you without passing judgment on you, without
trying to take responsibility for you, without trying to mold you, it
feels damn good! … When I have been listened to and when I have been
heard, I am able to reperceive my world in a new way and to go on. It is
astonishing how elements that seem insoluble become soluble when someone
listens, how confusions that seem irremediable turn into relatively
clear flowing streams when one is heard.”</p>
<p>Empathy allows us “to reperceive 〔our〕 world in a new way and to go
on.”</p>
<p>One of my favorite stories about empathy comes from the principal of
an innovative school. She had returned after lunch one day to find
Milly, an elementary school student, sitting dejectedly in her office
waiting to see her. She sat down next to Milly, who began,
“Mrs. Anderson, have you ever had a week when everything you did hurt
somebody else, and you never intended to hurt anyone at all?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” the principal replied, “I think I understand,” whereupon Milly
proceeded to describe her week. “By now,” the principal related, “I was
quite late for a very important meeting—still had my coat on—and anxious
not to keep a room full of people waiting, and so I asked, ‘Milly, what
can I do for you?’ Milly reached over, took both my shoulders in her
hands, looked me straight in the eyes, and said very firmly,
‘Mrs. Anderson, I don’t want you to do anything; I just want you to
listen.’</p>
<p>“Don’t just do something….”</p>
<p>“This was one of the most significant moments of learning in my
life—taught to me by a child—so I thought, ‘Never mind the roomful of
adults waiting for me!’ Milly and I moved over to a bench that afforded
us more privacy and sat, my arm around her shoulders, her head on my
chest, and her arm around my waist, while she talked until she was done.
And you know, it didn’t take that long.”</p>
<p>One of the most satisfying aspects of my work is to hear how
individuals have used NVC to strengthen their ability to connect
empathically with others. My friend Laurence, who lives in Switzerland,
described how upset she felt when her six-year-old son had stormed away
angrily while she was still talking to him. Isabelle, her ten-year-old
daughter, who had accompanied her to a recent NVC workshop, remarked,
“So you’re really angry, Mom. You’d like for him to talk when he’s angry
and not run off.” Laurence marveled at how, upon hearing Isabelle’s
words, she felt an immediate diminishing of tension, and was
subsequently able to be more understanding with her son when he
returned.</p>
<p>A college instructor described how relationships between students and
faculty had been affected when several members of the faculty learned to
listen empathically and to express themselves more vulnerably and
honestly. “The students opened up more and more and told us about the
various personal problems that were interfering with their studies. The
more they talked about it, the more work they were able to complete.
Even though this kind of listening took a lot of our time, we were glad
to spend it in this way. Unfortunately, the dean got upset; he said we
were not counselors and should spend more time teaching and less time
talking with the students.”</p>
<p>When I asked how the faculty had dealt with this, the instructor
replied, “We empathized with the dean’s concern. We heard that he felt
worried and wanted to know that we weren’t getting involved in things we
couldn’t handle. We also heard that he needed reassurance that the time
spent on talking wasn’t cutting into our teaching responsibilities. He
seemed relieved by the way we listened to him. We continued to talk with
the students because we could see that the more we listened to them, the
better they did in their studies.”</p>
<p>When we work in a hierarchically structured institution, there is a
tendency to hear commands and judgments from those higher up in the
hierarchy. While we may easily empathize with our peers and with those
in less powerful positions, we may find ourselves being defensive or
apologetic, instead of empathic, in the presence of those we identify as
our “superiors.” This is why I was particularly pleased that these
faculty members had remembered to empathize with their dean as well as
with their students.</p>
<p>It’s harder to empathize with those who appear to possess more power,
status, or resources.</p>
<h5 id="empathy-and-the-ability-to-be-vulnerable">Empathy and the
Ability to Be Vulnerable</h5>
<p>Because we are called to reveal our deepest feelings and needs, we
may sometimes find it challenging to express ourselves in NVC.
Self-expression becomes easier, however, after we empathize with others,
because we will then have touched their humanness and realized the
common qualities we share. The more we connect with the feelings and
needs behind their words, the less frightening it is to open up to other
people. The situations where we are the most reluctant to express
vulnerability are often those where we want to maintain a “tough image”
for fear of losing authority or control.</p>
<p>The more we empathize with the other party, the safer we feel.</p>
<p>Once I showed my vulnerability to some members of a street gang in
Cleveland by acknowledging the hurt I was feeling and my desire to be
treated with more respect. “Oh, look,” one of them remarked, “he’s
feeling hurt; isn’t that too bad!” at which point all his friends chimed
in laughing. Here again, I could interpret them as taking advantage of
my vulnerability (Option 2: Blame others), or I could empathize with the
feelings and needs behind their behavior (Option 4: Sense others’
feelings and needs).</p>
<p>If, however, I have an image that I’m being humiliated and taken
advantage of, I may feel too wounded, angry, or scared to be able to
empathize. At such a moment, I would need to withdraw physically in
order to offer myself some empathy or to request it from a reliable
source. After discovering the needs that had been so powerfully
triggered in me and receiving adequate empathy for them, I would then be
ready to return and empathize with the other party. In situations of
pain, I recommend first getting the empathy necessary to go beyond the
thoughts occupying our heads and recognize our deeper needs.</p>
<p>As I listened closely to the gang member’s remark, “Oh look, he’s
feeling hurt; isn’t that too bad?” and the laughter that followed, I
sensed that he and his friends were annoyed and not wanting to be
subjected to guilt trips and manipulation. They may have been reacting
to people in their pasts who used phrases like that hurts me to imply
disapproval. Since I didn’t verify it with them out loud, I have no way
of knowing if my guess was in fact accurate. Just focusing my attention
there, however, kept me from either taking it personally or getting
angry. Instead of judging them for ridiculing me or treating me
disrespectfully, I concentrated on hearing the pain and the needs behind
such behavior.</p>
<p>“Hey,” one of them burst out, “this is a bunch of crap you’re
offering us! Suppose there are members of another gang here and they
have guns and you don’t. And you say just stand there and talk to them?
Crap!”</p>
<p>Then everybody was laughing again, and again I directed my attention
to their feelings and needs: “So it sounds like you’re really fed up
with learning something that has no relevance in those situations?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and if you lived in this neighborhood, you’d know this is a
bunch of crap.”</p>
<p>“So you need to trust that someone teaching you something has some
knowledge of your neighborhood?”</p>
<p>“Damn right. Some of these dudes would blast you away before you got
two words out of your mouth!”</p>
<p>“And you need to trust that someone trying to teach you something
understands the dangers around here?” I continued to listen in this
manner, sometimes verbalizing what I heard and sometimes not. This
continued for forty-five minutes, and then I sensed a shift: they felt
that I was truly understanding them. A counselor in the program noticed
the shift, and asked them out loud, “What do you think of this man?” The
gentleman who had been giving me the roughest time replied, “He’s the
best speaker we’ve ever had.”</p>
<p>Astonished, the counselor turned to me and whispered, “But you
haven’t said anything!” In fact, I had said a lot by demonstrating that
there was nothing they could throw at me that couldn’t be translated
into universal human feelings and needs.</p>
<p>We “say a lot” by listening for other people’s feelings and
needs.</p>
<h5 id="using-empathy-to-defuse-danger">Using Empathy to Defuse
Danger</h5>
<p>The ability to offer empathy to people in stressful situations can
defuse potential violence.</p>
<p>A teacher in the inner city of St. Louis related an incident where
she had conscientiously stayed after school to help a student, even
though teachers were warned, for their own safety, to leave the building
after classes were dismissed. A stranger entered her classroom, where
the following exchange took place:</p>
<p>Young man: Take off your clothes.</p>
<p>Teacher: (noticing that the young man was shaking) I’m sensing this
is very scary for you.</p>
<p>Young man: Did you hear me? God damn it, take off your clothes!</p>
<p>Teacher: I’m sensing you’re really pissed off right now and you want
me to do what you’re telling me.</p>
<p>Young man: You’re damned right, and you’re going to get hurt if you
don’t.</p>
<p>Teacher: I’d like you to tell me if there’s some other way of meeting
your needs that wouldn’t hurt me.</p>
<p>Young man: I said take them off.</p>
<p>Teacher: I can hear how much you want this. At the same time, I want
you to know how scared and horrible I feel, and how grateful I’d be if
you’d leave without hurting me.</p>
<p>Young man: Give me your purse.</p>
<p>The teacher handed the stranger her purse, relieved not to be raped.
She later described how, each time she empathized with the young man,
she could sense him becoming less adamant in his intention to follow
through with the rape.</p>
<p>A metropolitan police officer attending a follow-up training in NVC
once greeted me with this account:</p>
<p>I’m sure glad you had us practicing empathy with angry people that
last time. Just a few days after our session, I went to arrest someone
in a public housing project. When I brought him out, my car was
surrounded by about sixty people screaming things at me like, ‘Let him
go! He didn’t do anything! You police are a bunch of racist pigs!’
Although I was skeptical that empathy would help, I didn’t have many
other options. So I reflected back the feelings that were coming at me;
I said things like, ‘So you don’t trust my reasons for arresting this
man? You think it has to do with race?’ After several minutes of my
continuing to reflect their feelings, the group became less hostile. In
the end they opened a path so I could get to my car.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to illustrate how a young woman used empathy to
bypass violence during her night shift at a drug detoxification center
in Toronto. The young woman recounted this story during the second NVC
workshop she attended. At eleven o’clock one night, a few weeks after
her first NVC training, a man who’d obviously been taking drugs walked
in off the street and demanded a room. The young woman started to
explain to him that all the rooms had been filled for the night. She was
about to hand the man the address of another detox center when he hurled
her to the ground. “The next thing I knew, he was sitting across my
chest holding a knife to my throat and shouting, ‘You bitch, don’t lie
to me! You do too have a room!’”</p>
<p>She then proceeded to apply her training by listening for his
feelings and needs.</p>
<p>“You remembered to do that under those conditions?” I asked,
impressed.</p>
<p>“What choice did I have? Desperation sometimes makes good
communicators of us all! You know, Marshall,” she added, “that joke you
told in the workshop really helped me. In fact, I think it saved my
life.”</p>
<p>“What joke?”</p>
<p>“Remember when you said never to put your ‘but’ in the face of an
angry person? I was all ready to start arguing with him; I was about to
say, ‘But I don’t have a room!’ when I remembered your joke. It had
really stayed with me because only the week before, I was arguing with
my mother and she’d said to me, ‘I could kill you when you answer “but”
to everything I say!’ Imagine, if my own mother was angry enough to kill
me for using that word, what would this man have done? If I’d said, ‘But
I don’t have a room!’ when he was screaming at me, I have no doubt he
would have slit my throat.</p>
<p>Rather than put your “but” in the face of an angry person,
empathize.</p>
<p>“So instead, I took a deep breath and said, ‘It sounds like you’re
really angry and you want to be given a room.’ He yelled back, ‘I may be
an addict, but by God, I deserve respect. I’m tired of nobody giving me
respect. My parents don’t give me respect. I’m gonna get respect!’ I
just focused on his feelings and needs and said, ‘Are you fed up, not
getting the respect that you want?’”</p>
<p>“How long did this go on?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, about another thirty-five minutes,” she replied.</p>
<p>“That must have been terrifying.”</p>
<p>“No, not after the first couple of interchanges, because then
something else we’d learned here became apparent. When I concentrated on
listening for his feelings and needs, I stopped seeing him as a monster.
I could see, just as you’d said, how people who seem like monsters are
simply human beings whose language and behavior sometimes keep us from
seeing their humanness. The more I was able to focus my attention on his
feelings and needs, the more I saw him as a person full of despair whose
needs weren’t being met. I became confident that if I held my attention
there, I wouldn’t be hurt. After he’d received the empathy he needed, he
got off me, put the knife away, and I helped him find a room at another
center.”</p>
<p>When we listen for feelings and needs, we no longer see people as
monsters.</p>
<p>Delighted that she’d learned to respond empathically in such an
extreme situation, I asked curiously, “What are you doing back here? It
sounds like you’ve mastered NVC and should be out teaching others what
you’ve learned.”</p>
<p>“Now I need you to help me with a hard one,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’m almost afraid to ask. What could be harder than that?”</p>
<p>“Now I need you to help me with my mother. Despite all the insight I
got into that ‘but’ phenomenon, you know what happened? At supper the
next evening when I told my mother what had happened, she said, ‘You’re
going to cause your father and me to have a heart attack if you keep
that job. You simply have to find different work!’ So guess what I said
to her? ‘But, mother, it’s my life!’”</p>
<p>It may be difficult to empathize with those who are closest to
us.</p>
<p>I couldn’t have asked for a more compelling example of how difficult
it can be to respond empathically to one’s own family members!</p>
<h5 id="empathy-in-hearing-someones-no">Empathy in Hearing Someone’s
“No!”</h5>
<p>Because of our tendency to read rejection into someone else’s “no”
and “I don’t want to … ,” these are important messages for us to be able
to empathize with. If we take them personally, we may feel hurt without
understanding what’s actually going on within the other person. When we
shine the light of consciousness on the feelings and needs behind
someone else’s “no,” however, we become cognizant of what they are
wanting that prevents them from responding as we would like.</p>
<p>Empathizing with someone’s “no” protects us from taking it
personally.</p>
<p>One time I asked a woman during a workshop break to join me and other
participants for some ice cream nearby. “No!” she replied brusquely. The
tone of her voice led me to interpret her answer as a rejection, until I
reminded myself to tune in to the feelings and needs she might be
expressing through her “no.” “I sense that you are angry,” I said. “Is
that so?”</p>
<p>“No,” she replied, “it’s just that I don’t want to be corrected every
time I open my mouth.”</p>
<p>Now I sensed that she was fearful rather than angry. I checked this
out by asking, “So you’re feeling fearful and want to protect yourself
from being in a situation where you might be judged for how you
communicate?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she affirmed, “I can imagine sitting in the ice cream shop
with you and having you notice everything I say.”</p>
<p>I then discovered that the way I’d been providing feedback in the
workshop had been frightening to her. My empathy for her message had
taken the sting out of her “no” for me: I heard her desire to avoid
receiving similar feedback in public. Assuring her that I wouldn’t
evaluate her communication in public, I then conferred with her on ways
to give feedback that would leave her feeling safe. And yes, she joined
the group for ice cream.</p>
<h5 id="empathy-to-revive-a-lifeless-conversation">Empathy to Revive a
Lifeless Conversation</h5>
<p>We have all found ourselves in the midst of a lifeless conversation.
Perhaps we’re at a social event, hearing words without feeling any
connection to the speaker. Or we’re listening to someone my friend Kelly
Bryson would call a “Babble-on-ian”—someone who elicits in their
listeners the fear of interminable conversation. Vitality drains out of
conversations when we lose connection with the feelings and needs
generating the speaker’s words, and with the requests associated with
those needs. This effect is common when people talk without
consciousness of what they are feeling, needing, or requesting. Instead
of being engaged in an exchange of life energy with other human beings,
we see ourselves becoming wastebaskets for their words.</p>
<p>How and when do we interrupt a dead conversation to bring it back to
life? I’d suggest the best time to interrupt is when we’ve heard one
word more than we want to hear. The longer we wait, the harder it is to
be civil when we do step in. Our intention in interrupting is not to
claim the floor for ourselves, but to help the speaker connect to the
life energy behind the words being spoken.</p>
<p>We do this by tuning in to possible feelings and needs. Thus, if an
aunt is repeating the story about how twenty years ago her husband
deserted her and her two small children, we might interrupt by saying,
“So, Auntie, it sounds like you are still feeling hurt, wishing you’d
been treated more fairly.” People are not aware that empathy is often
what they are needing. Neither do they realize that they are more likely
to receive that empathy by expressing the feelings and needs that are
alive in them than by recounting tales of past injustice and
hardship.</p>
<p>To bring a conversation back to life: interrupt with empathy.</p>
<p>Another way to bring a conversation to life is to openly express our
desire to be more connected, and to request information that would help
us establish that connection. Once, at a cocktail party, I was in the
midst of an abundant flow of words that to me seemed lifeless. “Excuse
me,” I broke in, addressing the group of nine other people I’d found
myself with, “I’m feeling impatient because I’d like to be more
connected with you, but our conversation isn’t creating the kind of
connection I’m wanting. I’d like to know if the conversation we’ve been
having is meeting your needs, and if so, what needs of yours are being
met through it.”</p>
<p>All nine people stared at me as if I had thrown a rat in the punch
bowl. Fortunately, I remembered to tune in to the feelings and needs
being expressed through their silence. “Are you annoyed with my
interrupting because you would have liked to continue the conversation?”
I asked.</p>
<p>After another silence, one of the men replied, “No, I’m not annoyed.
I was thinking about what you were asking. And no, I wasn’t enjoying the
conversation; in fact, I was totally bored with it.”</p>
<p>What bores the listener bores the speaker too.</p>
<p>At the time, I was surprised to hear his response because he had been
the one doing most of the talking! Now I am no longer surprised: I have
since discovered that conversations that are lifeless for the listener
are equally so for the speaker.</p>
<p>You may wonder how we can muster the courage to flatly interrupt
someone in the middle of a sentence. I once conducted an informal
survey, posing the following question: “If you are using more words than
somebody wants to hear, do you want that person to pretend to listen or
to stop you?” Of the scores of people I approached, all but one
expressed a preference to be stopped. Their answers gave me courage by
convincing me that it is more considerate to interrupt people than to
pretend to listen. All of us want our words to enrich others, not to
burden them.</p>
<p>Speakers prefer that listeners interrupt rather than pretend to
listen.</p>
<h5 id="empathy-for-silence">Empathy for Silence</h5>
<p>One of the hardest messages for many of us to empathize with is
silence. This is especially true when we’ve expressed ourselves
vulnerably and need to know how others are reacting to our words. At
such times, it’s easy to project our worst fears onto the lack of
response and forget to connect with the feelings and needs being
expressed through the silence.</p>
<p>One time when I was working with the staff of a business
organization, I was talking about something deeply emotional and began
to cry. When I looked up, I received a response from the organization’s
director that was not easy for me to receive: silence. He turned his
face from me with what I interpreted to be an expression of disgust.
Fortunately, I remembered to put my attention on what might be going on
within him, and said, “I’m sensing from your response to my crying that
you’re feeling disgusted, and you’d prefer to have someone more in
control of his feelings consulting with your staff.”</p>
<p>Empathize with silence by listening for the feelings and needs behind
it.</p>
<p>If he had answered yes, I would have been able to accept that we had
different values around expressing emotions, without somehow thinking
that I was wrong for having expressed my emotions as I did. But instead
of “yes,” the director replied, “No, not at all. I was just thinking of
how my wife wishes I could cry.” He went on to reveal that his wife, who
was divorcing him, had been complaining that living with him was like
living with a rock.</p>
<p>During my practice as a psychotherapist, I was contacted by the
parents of a twenty-year-old woman under psychiatric care. She had been
undergoing medication, hospitalization, and shock treatments for several
months, and had become mute three months before her parents contacted
me. When they brought her to my office, she had to be assisted because,
left to herself, she didn’t move.</p>
<p>In my office, she crouched in her chair, shaking, her eyes on the
floor. Trying to connect empathically with the feelings and needs being
expressed through her nonverbal message, I said, “I’m sensing that you
are frightened and would like to be sure that it’s safe to talk. Is that
accurate?”</p>
<p>She showed no reaction, so I expressed my own feeling by saying, “I’m
very concerned about you, and I’d like you to tell me if there’s
something I could say or do to make you feel safer.” Still no response.
For the next forty minutes, I continued to either reflect her feelings
and needs or express my own. There was no visible response, nor even the
slightest recognition that I was trying to communicate with her. Finally
I expressed that I was tired, and that I wanted her to return the
following day.</p>
<p>The next few days were like the first. I continued focusing my
attention on her feelings and needs, sometimes verbally reflecting what
I understood and sometimes doing so silently. From time to time I would
express what was going on in myself. She sat shaking in her chair,
saying nothing.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, when she still didn’t respond, I reached over and
held her hand. Not knowing whether my words were communicating my
concern, I hoped the physical contact might do so more effectively. At
first contact, her muscles tensed and she shrank further back into her
chair. I was about to release her hand when I sensed a slight yielding,
so I kept my hold; after a few moments I noticed a progressive
relaxation on her part. I held her hand for several minutes while I
talked to her as I had the first few days. Still she said nothing.</p>
<p>When she arrived the next day, she appeared even more tense than
before, but there was one difference: she extended a clenched fist
toward me while turning her face away from me. I was at first confused
by the gesture, but then sensed she had something in her hand she wanted
me to have. Taking her fist in my hand, I pried open her fingers. In her
palm was a crumpled note with the following message: “Please help me say
what’s inside.”</p>
<p>I was elated to receive this sign of her desire to communicate. After
another hour of encouragement, she finally expressed a first sentence,
slowly and fearfully. When I reflected back what I had heard her saying,
she appeared relieved and then continued, slowly and fearfully, to talk.
A year later, she sent me a copy of the following entries from her
journal:</p>
<p>I came out of the hospital, away from shock treatments and strong
medicine. That was about April. The three months before that are
completely blank in my mind, as well as the three and a half years
before April.</p>
<p>They say that, after getting out of the hospital, I went through a
time at home of not eating, not talking, and wanting to stay in bed all
the time. Then I was referred to Dr. Rosenberg for counseling. I don’t
remember much of those next two or three months other than being in
Dr. Rosenberg’s office and talking with him.</p>
<p>I’d begun ‘waking up’ since that first session with him. I’d begun
sharing with him things that bothered me—things that I would never have
dreamed of telling anyone about. And I remember how much that meant to
me. It was so hard to talk. But Dr. Rosenberg cared about me and showed
it, and I wanted to talk with him. I was always glad afterwards that I
had let something out. I remember counting the days, even the hours,
until my next appointment with him.</p>
<p>I’ve also learned that facing reality is not all bad. I am realizing
more and more of the things that I need to stand up to, things that I
need to get out and do on my own.</p>
<p>This is scary. And it’s very hard. And it’s so discouraging that when
I am trying really a lot, I can still fail so terribly. But the good
part of reality is that I’ve been seeing that it includes wonderful
things, too.</p>
<p>I’ve learned in the past year about how wonderful it can be to share
myself with other people. I think it was mostly just one part that I
learned, about the thrill of my talking to other people and having them
actually listen—even really understand at times.</p>
<p>I continue to be amazed by the healing power of empathy. Time and
again I have witnessed people transcend the paralyzing effects of
psychological pain when they have sufficient contact with someone who
can hear them empathically. As listeners, we don’t need insights into
psychological dynamics or training in psychotherapy. What is essential
is our ability to be present to what’s really going on within—to the
unique feelings and needs a person is experiencing in that very
moment.</p>
<p>Empathy lies in our ability to be present.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Our ability to offer empathy can allow us to stay vulnerable, defuse
potential violence, hear the word no without taking it as a rejection,
revive a lifeless conversation, and even hear the feelings and needs
expressed through silence. Time and again, people transcend the
paralyzing effects of psychological pain when they have sufficient
contact with someone who can hear them empathically.</p>
