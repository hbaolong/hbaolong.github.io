<h4 id="taking-responsibility-for-our-feelings">Taking Responsibility
for Our Feelings</h4>
<p>People are disturbed not by things, but by the view they take of
them.</p>
<p>—Epictetus</p>
<h5 id="hearing-a-negative-message-four-options">Hearing a Negative
Message: Four Options</h5>
<p>The third component of NVC entails the acknowledgment of the root of
our feelings. NVC heightens our awareness that what others say and do
may be the stimulus, but never the cause, of our feelings. We see that
our feelings result from how we choose to receive what others say and
do, as well as from our particular needs and expectations in that
moment. With this third component, we are led to accept responsibility
for what we do to generate our own feelings.</p>
<p>What others do may be the stimulus of our feelings, but not the
cause.</p>
<p>When someone gives us a negative message, whether verbally or
nonverbally, we have four options as to how to receive it. One option is
to take it personally by hearing blame and criticism. For example,
someone is angry and says, “You’re the most self-centered person I’ve
ever met!” If choosing to take it personally, we might react: “Oh, I
should’ve been more sensitive!” We accept the other person’s judgment
and blame ourselves. We choose this option at great cost to our
self-esteem, for it inclines us toward feelings of guilt, shame, and
depression.</p>
<p>Four options for receiving negative messages: 1. blame ourselves.</p>
<p>A second option is to fault the speaker. For example, in response to
“You’re the most self-centered person I’ve ever met,” we might protest:
“You have no right to say that! I am always considering your needs.
You’re the one who is really self-centered.” When we receive messages
this way, and blame the speaker, we are likely to feel anger.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>blame others.</li>
</ol>
<p>When receiving negative messages, our third option would be to shine
the light of consciousness on our own feelings and needs. Thus, we might
reply, “When I hear you say that I am the most self-centered person
you’ve ever met, I feel hurt, because I need some recognition of my
efforts to be considerate of your preferences.” By focusing attention on
our own feelings and needs, we become conscious that our current feeling
of hurt derives from a need for our efforts to be recognized.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>sense our own feelings and needs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, a fourth option on receiving a negative message is to shine
the light of consciousness on the other person’s feelings and needs as
they are currently expressed. We might for example ask, “Are you feeling
hurt because you need more consideration for your preferences?”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>sense others’ feelings and needs.</li>
</ol>
<p>We accept responsibility for our feelings, rather than blame other
people, by acknowledging our own needs, desires, expectations, values,
or thoughts. Note the difference between the following expressions of
disappointment:</p>
<p>Example 1</p>
<p>A: “You disappointed me by not coming over last evening.”</p>
<p>B: “I was disappointed when you didn’t come over, because I wanted to
talk over some things that were bothering me.”</p>
<p>Speaker A attributes responsibility for his disappointment solely to
another person’s action. Speaker B traces his feeling of disappointment
to his own unfulfilled desire.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>A: “Their cancelling the contract really irritated me!”</p>
<p>B: “When they cancelled the contract, I felt really irritated because
I was thinking to myself that it was an awfully irresponsible thing to
do.”</p>
<p>Speaker A attributes her irritation solely to the behavior of the
other party, whereas Speaker B accepts responsibility for her feeling by
acknowledging the thought behind it. She recognizes that her blaming way
of thinking has generated her irritation. In NVC, however, we would urge
this speaker to go a step further by identifying what she is wanting:
what need, desire, expectation, hope, or value of hers has not been
fulfilled? As we shall see, the more we are able to connect our feelings
to our own needs, the easier it is for others to respond
compassionately. To relate her feelings to what she is wanting, Speaker
B might have said: “When they cancelled the contract, I felt really
irritated because I was hoping for an opportunity to rehire the workers
we laid off last year.”</p>
<p>It is helpful to recognize a number of common speech patterns that
tend to mask accountability for our own feelings:</p>
<p>Use of impersonal pronouns such as it and that:</p>
<p>“It really infuriates me when spelling mistakes appear in our public
brochures.” “That bugs me a lot.”</p>
<p>The use of the expression “I feel (an emotion) because …” followed by
a person or personal pronoun other than I:</p>
<p>“I feel hurt because you said you don’t love me.” “I feel angry
because the supervisor broke her promise.”</p>
<p>Statements that mention only the actions of others:</p>
<p>“When you don’t call me on my birthday, I feel hurt.” “Mommy is
disappointed when you don’t finish your food.”</p>
<p>In each of these instances, we can deepen our awareness of our own
responsibility by substituting the phrase, “I feel … because I …” For
example:</p>
<p>Connect your feeling with your need: “I feel … because I need …”</p>
<p>“I feel really infuriated when spelling mistakes like that appear in
our public brochures, because I want our company to project a
professional image.”</p>
<p>“I feel angry that the supervisor broke her promise, because I was
counting on getting that long weekend to visit my brother.”</p>
<p>“Mommy feels disappointed when you don’t finish your food, because I
want you to grow up strong and healthy.”</p>
<p>The basic mechanism of motivating by guilt is to attribute the
responsibility for one’s own feelings to others. When parents say, “It
hurts Mommy and Daddy when you get poor grades at school,” they are
implying that the child’s actions are the cause of the parents’
happiness or unhappiness. On the surface, taking responsibility for the
feelings of others can easily be mistaken for positive caring. It may
appear that the child cares for the parent and feels bad because the
parent is suffering. However, if children who assume this kind of
responsibility change their behavior in accordance with parental wishes,
they are not acting from the heart, but acting to avoid guilt.</p>
<p>Distinguish between giving from the heart and being motivated by
guilt.</p>
<h5 id="the-needs-at-the-roots-of-feelings">The Needs at the Roots of
Feelings</h5>
<p>Judgments, criticisms, diagnoses, and interpretations of others are
all alienated expressions of our needs. If someone says, “You never
understand me,” they are really telling us that their need to be
understood is not being fulfilled. If a wife says, “You’ve been working
late every night this week; you love your work more than you love me,”
she is saying that her need for intimacy is not being met.</p>
<p>Judgments of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet
needs.</p>
<p>When we express our needs indirectly through the use of evaluations,
interpretations, and images, others are likely to hear criticism. And
when people hear anything that sounds like criticism, they tend to
invest their energy in self-defense or counterattack. If we wish for a
compassionate response from others, it is self-defeating to express our
needs by interpreting or diagnosing their behavior. Instead, the more
directly we can connect our feelings to our own needs, the easier it is
for others to respond to us compassionately.</p>
<p>If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them
met.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of us have never been taught to think in terms of
needs. We are accustomed to thinking about what’s wrong with other
people when our needs aren’t being fulfilled. Thus, if we want coats to
be hung up in the closet, we may characterize our children as lazy for
leaving them on the couch. Or we may interpret our co-workers as
irresponsible when they don’t go about their tasks the way we would
prefer them to.</p>
<p>I was once invited to Southern California to mediate between some
landowners and migrant farm workers whose conflicts had grown
increasingly hostile and violent. I began the meeting by asking these
two questions: “What is it that you are each needing? And what would you
like to request of the other in relation to these needs?”</p>
<p>“The problem is that these people are racist!” shouted a farm worker.
“The problem is that these people don’t respect law and order!” shouted
a landowner even more loudly. As is often the case, these groups were
more skilled in analyzing the perceived wrongness of others than in
clearly expressing their own needs.</p>
<p>In a comparable situation, I once met with a group of Israelis and
Palestinians who wanted to establish the mutual trust necessary to bring
peace to their homelands. I opened the session with the same questions,
“What is it you are needing and what would you like to request from one
another in relation to those needs?” Instead of directly stating his
needs, a Palestinian mukhtar (who is like a village mayor) answered,
“You people are acting like a bunch of Nazis.” A statement like that is
not likely to get the cooperation of a group of Israelis! Almost
immediately, an Israeli woman jumped up and countered, “Mukhtar, that
was a totally insensitive thing for you to say!”</p>
<p>Here were people who had come together to build trust and harmony,
but after only one interchange, matters were worse than before they
began. This happens often when people are used to analyzing and blaming
one another rather than clearly expressing what they need. In this case,
the woman could have responded to the mukhtar in terms of her own needs
and requests by saying, for example, “I am needing more respect in our
dialogue. Instead of telling us how you think we are acting, would you
tell us what it is we are doing that you find disturbing?”</p>
<p>It has been my experience over and over again that from the moment
people begin talking about what they need rather than what’s wrong with
one another, the possibility of finding ways to meet everybody’s needs
is greatly increased. The following are some of the basic human needs we
all share:</p>
<p>Autonomy</p>
<p>to choose one’s dreams, goals, values</p>
<p>to choose one’s plan for fulfilling one’s dreams, goals, values</p>
<p>Celebration</p>
<p>to celebrate the creation of life and dreams fulfilled</p>
<p>to celebrate losses: loved ones, dreams, etc. (mourning)</p>
<p>Integrity</p>
<p>authenticity</p>
<p>creativity</p>
<p>meaning</p>
<p>self-worth</p>
<p>Interdependence</p>
<p>acceptance</p>
<p>appreciation</p>
<p>closeness</p>
<p>community</p>
<p>consideration</p>
<p>contribution to the enrichment of life (to exercise one’s power by
giving that which contributes to life)</p>
<p>emotional safety</p>
<p>empathy</p>
<p>honesty (the empowering honesty that enables us to learn from our
limitations)</p>
<p>love</p>

<h5
id="the-pain-of-expressing-our-needs-versus-the-pain-of-not-expressing-our-needs">The
Pain of Expressing Our Needs versus the Pain of Not Expressing Our
Needs</h5>
<p>In a world where we’re often judged harshly for identifying and
revealing our needs, doing so can be very frightening. Women, in
particular, are susceptible to criticism. For centuries, the image of
the loving woman has been associated with sacrifice and the denial of
one’s own needs to take care of others. Because women are socialized to
view the caretaking of others as their highest duty, they often learn to
ignore their own needs.</p>
<p>At one workshop, we discussed what happens to women who internalize
such beliefs. These women, if they ask for what they want, will often do
so in a way that both reflects and reinforces the beliefs that they have
no genuine right to their needs and that their needs are unimportant.
For example, because she is fearful of asking for what she needs, a
woman may fail to simply say that she’s had a busy day, is feeling
tired, and wants some time in the evening to herself; instead, her words
come out sounding like a legal case: “You know I haven’t had a moment to
myself all day. I ironed all the shirts, did the whole week’s laundry,
took the dog to the vet, made dinner, packed the lunches, and called all
the neighbors about the block meeting, so 〔imploringly〕 … so how about
if you … ?”</p>
<p>“No!” comes the swift response. Her plaintive request elicits
resistance rather than compassion from her listeners. They have
difficulty hearing and valuing the needs behind her pleas, and
furthermore react negatively to her weak attempt to argue from a
position of what she “should” get or “deserves” to get from them. In the
end the speaker is again persuaded that her needs don’t matter, not
realizing that they were expressed in a way unlikely to draw a positive
response.</p>
<p>My mother was once at a workshop where other women were discussing
how frightening it was to be expressing their needs. Suddenly she got up
and left the room, and didn’t return for a long time. She finally
reappeared, looking very pale. In the presence of the group, I asked,
“Mother, are you all right?”</p>
<p>If we don’t value our needs, others may not either.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she answered, “but I just had a sudden realization that’s very
hard for me to take in.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“I’ve just become aware that for thirty-six years, I was angry with
your father for not meeting my needs, and now I realize that I never
once clearly told him what I needed.”</p>
<p>My mother’s revelation was accurate. Not one time, that I can
remember, did she clearly express her needs to my father. She’d hint
around and go through all kinds of convolutions, but never would she ask
directly for what she needed.</p>
<p>We tried to understand why it was so hard for her to have done so. My
mother grew up in an economically impoverished family. She recalled
asking for things as a child and being admonished by her brothers and
sisters, “You shouldn’t ask for that! You know we’re poor. Do you think
you are the only person in the family?” Eventually she grew to fear that
asking for what she needed would only lead to disapproval and
judgment.</p>
<p>She related a childhood anecdote about one of her sisters who had had
an appendix operation and afterwards had been given a beautiful little
purse by another sister. My mother was fourteen at the time. Oh, how she
yearned to have an exquisitely beaded purse like her sister’s, but she
dared not open her mouth. So guess what? She feigned a pain in her side
and went the whole way with her story. Her family took her to several
doctors. They were unable to produce a diagnosis and so opted for
exploratory surgery. It had been a bold gamble on my mother’s part, but
it worked—she was given an identical little purse! When she received the
coveted purse, my mother was elated despite being in physical agony from
the surgery. Two nurses came in and one stuck a thermometer in her
mouth. My mother said, “Ummm, ummm,” to show the purse to the second
nurse, who answered, “Oh, for me? Why, thank you!” and took the purse!
My mother was at a loss, and never figured out how to say, “I didn’t
mean to give it to you. Please return it to me.” Her story poignantly
reveals how painful it can be when people don’t openly acknowledge their
needs.</p>
<h5 id="from-emotional-slavery-to-emotional-liberation">From Emotional
Slavery to Emotional Liberation</h5>
<p>In our development toward a state of emotional liberation, most of us
experience three stages in the way we relate to others.</p>
<p>Stage 1: In this stage, which I refer to as emotional slavery, we
believe ourselves responsible for the feelings of others. We think we
must constantly strive to keep everyone happy. If they don’t appear
happy, we feel responsible and compelled to do something about it. This
can easily lead us to see the very people who are closest to us as
burdens.</p>
<p>Taking responsibility for the feelings of others can be very
detrimental to intimate relationships. I routinely hear variations on
the following theme: “I’m really scared to be in a relationship. Every
time I see my partner in pain or needing something, I feel overwhelmed.
I feel like I’m in prison, that I’m being smothered—and I just have to
get out of the relationship as fast as possible.” This response is
common among those who experience love as denial of one’s own needs in
order to attend to the needs of the beloved. In the early days of a
relationship, partners typically relate joyfully and compassionately to
each other out of a sense of freedom. The relationship is exhilarating,
spontaneous, wonderful. Eventually, however, as the relationship becomes
“serious,” partners may begin to assume responsibility for each other’s
feelings.</p>
<p>First stage: Emotional slavery. We see ourselves responsible for
others’ feelings.</p>
<p>If I were a partner who is conscious of doing this, I might
acknowledge the situation by explaining, “I can’t bear it when I lose
myself in relationships. When I see my partner’s pain, I lose me, and
then I just have to break free.” However, if I have not reached this
level of awareness, I am likely to blame my partner for the
deterioration of the relationship. Thus I might say, “My partner is so
needy and dependent it’s really stressing out our relationship.”</p>
<p>In such a case, my partner would do well to reject the notion that
there is anything wrong with her needs. It would only make a bad
situation worse to accept that blame. Instead, she could offer an
empathic response to the pain of my emotional slavery: “So you find
yourself in panic. It’s very hard for you to hold on to the deep caring
and love we’ve had without turning it into a responsibility, duty,
obligation…. You sense your freedom closing down because you think you
constantly have to take care of me.” If, however, instead of an empathic
response, she says, “Are you feeling tense because I have been making
too many demands on you?” then both of us are likely to stay enmeshed in
emotional slavery, making it that much more difficult for the
relationship to survive.</p>
<p>Stage 2: In this stage, we become aware of the high costs of assuming
responsibility for others’ feelings and trying to accommodate them at
our own expense. When we notice how much of our lives we’ve missed and
how little we have responded to the call of our own soul, we may get
angry. I refer jokingly to this stage as the obnoxious stage because we
tend toward obnoxious comments like, “That’s your problem! I’m not
responsible for your feelings!” when presented with another person’s
pain. We are clear what we are not responsible for, but have yet to
learn how to be responsible to others in a way that is not emotionally
enslaving.</p>
<p>Second stage: The obnoxious stage. We feel angry; we no longer want
to be responsible for others’ feelings.</p>
<p>As we emerge from the stage of emotional slavery, we may continue to
carry remnants of fear and guilt around having our own needs. Thus it is
not surprising that we end up expressing our needs in ways that sound
rigid and unyielding to the ears of others. For example, during a break
in one of my workshops, a young woman expressed appreciation for the
insights she’d gained into her own state of emotional enslavement. When
the workshop resumed, I suggested an activity to the group. The same
young woman then declared assertively, “I’d rather do something else.” I
sensed she was exercising her newfound right to express her needs—even
if they ran counter to those of others.</p>
<p>To encourage her to sort out what she wanted, I asked, “Do you want
to do something else even if it conflicts with my needs?” She thought
for a moment, and then stammered, “Yes…. er … I mean, no.” Her confusion
reflects how, in the obnoxious stage, we have yet to grasp that
emotional liberation entails more than simply asserting our own
needs.</p>
<p>I recall an incident during my daughter Marla’s passage toward
emotional liberation. She had always been the “perfect little girl” who
denied her own needs to comply with the wishes of others. When I became
aware of how frequently she suppressed her own desires in order to
please others, I talked to her about how I’d enjoy hearing her express
her needs more often. When we first broached the subject, Marla cried.
“But, Daddy, I don’t want to disappoint anybody!” she protested
helplessly. I tried to show Marla how her honesty would be a gift more
precious to others than accommodating them to prevent their upset. I
also clarified ways she could empathize with people when they were upset
without taking responsibility for their feelings.</p>
<p>A short time later, I saw evidence that my daughter was beginning to
express her needs more openly. A call came from her school principal,
apparently disturbed by a communication he’d had with Marla, who had
arrived at school wearing overalls. “Marla,” he’d said, “young women do
not dress this way.” To which Marla had responded, “Bug off!”</p>
<p>Hearing this was cause for celebration: Marla had graduated from
emotional slavery to obnoxiousness! She was learning to express her
needs and risk dealing with the displeasure of others. Surely she had
yet to assert her needs comfortably and in a way that respected the
needs of others, but I trusted this would occur in time.</p>
<p>Stage 3: At the third stage, emotional liberation, we respond to the
needs of others out of compassion, never out of fear, guilt, or shame.
Our actions are therefore fulfilling to us, as well as to those who
receive our efforts. We accept full responsibility for our own
intentions and actions, but not for the feelings of others. At this
stage, we are aware that we can never meet our own needs at the expense
of others. Emotional liberation involves stating clearly what we need in
a way that communicates we are equally concerned that the needs of
others be fulfilled. NVC is designed to support us in relating at this
level.</p>
<p>Third stage: Emotional liberation. We take responsibility for our
intentions and actions.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>The third component of NVC is the acknowledgment of the needs behind
our feelings. What others say and do may be the stimulus for, but never
the cause of, our feelings. When someone communicates negatively, we
have four options as to how to receive the message: (1) blame ourselves,
(2) blame others, (3) sense our own feelings and needs, (4) sense the
feelings and needs hidden in the other person’s negative message.</p>
<p>Judgments, criticisms, diagnoses, and interpretations of others are
all alienated expressions of our own needs and values. When others hear
criticism, they tend to invest their energy in self-defense or
counterattack. The more directly we can connect our feelings to our
needs, the easier it is for others to respond compassionately.</p>
<p>In a world where we are often harshly judged for identifying and
revealing our needs, doing so can be very frightening, especially for
women who are socialized to ignore their own needs while caring for
others.</p>
<p>In the course of developing emotional responsibility, most of us
experience three stages: (1) “emotional slavery”—believing ourselves
responsible for the feelings of others, (2) “the obnoxious stage”—in
which we refuse to admit to caring what anyone else feels or needs, and
(3) “emotional liberation”—in which we accept full responsibility for
our own feelings but not the feelings of others, while being aware that
we can never meet our own needs at the expense of others.</p>
<p>NVC in Action</p>
<p>“Bring Back the Stigma of Illegitimacy!”</p>
<p>A student of Nonviolent Communication volunteering at a food bank was
shocked when an elderly co-worker burst out from behind a newspaper,
“What we need to do in this country is bring back the stigma of
illegitimacy!”</p>
<p>The student’s habitual reaction to this kind of statement would have
been to say nothing, to judge the other severely but silently, and
eventually to process her own feelings safely away from the scene. This
time, she remembered she had the option of listening for the feelings
and needs behind the words that had shocked her.</p>
<p>Student: (first checking out her guess as to what the coworker was
observing) Are you reading something about teenage pregnancies in the
paper?</p>
<p>Co-worker: Yes, it’s unbelievable how many of them are doing it!</p>
<p>Student: (now listening for the co-worker’s feeling, and what unmet
need might be giving rise to this feeling) Are you feeling alarmed
because you’d like kids to have stable families?</p>
<p>Co-worker: Of course! Do you know, my father would have killed me if
I had done anything like that!</p>
<p>Student: So you’re remembering how it was for the girls in your
generation who got pregnant?</p>
<p>Co-worker: Sure thing! We knew what would happen to us if we got
pregnant. We were scared about it all the time, not like these girls
nowadays.</p>
<p>Student: Are you annoyed that there is no fear of punishment for the
girls who get pregnant these days?</p>
<p>Co-worker: Well, at least fear and punishment worked! It says here
that there are girls sleeping around with different men just so they can
get pregnant! That’s right! They have babies and the rest of us in
society pay for it!</p>
<p>The student of NVC heard two different feelings in this statement:
astonishment that girls would deliberately get pregnant, and annoyance
that taxpayers end up paying for children born in this way. She chose
which feeling to empathize with.</p>
<p>Student: Are you astonished to realize that people are getting
pregnant these days without any consideration for reputation,
consequences, financial stability … all the things you used to
consider?</p>
<p>Co-worker: Yeah, and guess who ends up paying for it?</p>
<p>The co-worker, probably feeling heard around her astonishment, moved
on to her other feeling: that of annoyance. As often happens when there
is a mixture of feelings present, the speaker will return to those that
have not received empathic attention. It is not necessary for the
listener to reflect back a complex mixture of feelings all at once; the
flow of compassion will continue as each feeling comes up again in its
turn.</p>
<p>Student: Sounds like you’re exasperated because you’d like your tax
money to be used for other purposes. Is that so?</p>
<p>Co-worker: Certainly is! Do you know that my son and his wife want a
second child and they can’t have one—even though they have two
jobs—because it costs so much?</p>
<p>Student: I guess you’re sad about that? You’d probably love to have a
second grandchild …</p>
<p>Co-worker: Yes, and it’s not just for me that it would make a
difference.</p>
<p>Student: … and for your son to have the family he wants … (Even
though the student guessed only partially correctly, she did not
interrupt the flow of empathy, instead allowing the co-worker to
continue and realize another concern.)</p>
<p>Co-worker: Yes, I think it’s sad to be a single child too.</p>
<p>Student: Oh, I see; you’d like for Katie to have a little
brother?</p>
<p>Co-worker: That would be nice.</p>
<p>At this point, the student sensed a release in her co-worker. A
moment of silence elapsed. She felt surprised to discover that, while
she still wanted to express her own views, her urgency and tension had
dissipated because she no longer felt “adversarial.” She understood the
feelings and needs behind her co-worker’s statements and no longer felt
that the two of them were “worlds apart.”</p>
<p>Student: (expressing herself in NVC, and using all four parts of the
process: observation 〔O〕, feeling 〔F〕, need 〔N〕, request 〔R〕)
You know, when you first said that we should bring back the stigma of
illegitimacy (O), I got really scared (F), because it really matters to
me that all of us here share a deep caring for people needing help (N).
Some of the people coming here for food are teenage parents (O), and I
want to make sure they feel welcome (N). Would you mind telling me how
you feel when you see Dashal, or Amy and her boyfriend, walking in?
(R)</p>
<p>The dialogue continued with several more exchanges until the woman
got the reassurance she needed that her co-worker did indeed offer
caring and respectful help to unmarried teen clients. Even more
importantly, what the woman gained was a new experience in expressing
disagreement in a way that met her needs for honesty and mutual
respect.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the co-worker left satisfied that her concerns
around teen pregnancy had been fully heard. Both parties felt
understood, and their relationship benefited from their having shared
their understanding and differences without hostility. In the absence of
NVC, their relationship might have begun to deteriorate from this
moment, and the work they both wanted to do in common—helping
people—might have suffered.</p>
<p>Exercise 3</p>
<p>ACKNOWLEDGING NEEDS</p>
<p>To practice identifying needs, please circle the number in front of
each statement where the speaker is acknowledging responsibility for his
or her feelings.</p>
<p>“You irritate me when you leave company documents on the conference
room floor.”</p>
<p>“I feel angry when you say that, because I am wanting respect and I
hear your words as an insult.”</p>
<p>“I feel frustrated when you come late.”</p>
<p>“I’m sad that you won’t be coming for dinner because I was hoping we
could spend the evening together.”</p>
<p>“I feel disappointed because you said you would do it and you
didn’t.”</p>
<p>“I’m discouraged because I would have liked to have progressed
further in my work by now.”</p>
<p>“Little things people say sometimes hurt me.”</p>
<p>“I feel happy that you received that award.”</p>
<p>“I feel scared when you raise your voice.”</p>
<p>“I am grateful that you offered me a ride because I was needing to
get home before my children arrive.”</p>
<p>Here are my responses for Exercise 3:</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To me, the
statement implies that the other person’s behavior is solely responsible
for the speaker’s feelings. It doesn’t reveal the needs or thoughts that
are contributing to the speaker’s feelings. To do so, the speaker might
have said, “I’m irritated when you leave company documents on the
conference room floor, because I want our documents to be safely stored
and accessible.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that the speaker is
acknowledging responsibility for his or her feelings.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To express the
needs or thoughts underlying his or her feelings, the speaker might have
said, “I feel frustrated when you come late because I was hoping we’d be
able to get some front-row seats.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that the speaker is
acknowledging responsibility for his or her feelings.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To express the
needs and thoughts underlying his or her feelings, the speaker might
have said, “When you said you’d do it and then didn’t, I felt
disappointed because I want to be able to rely upon your words.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that the speaker is
acknowledging responsibility for his or her feelings.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To express the
needs and thoughts underlying his or her feelings, the speaker might
have said, “Sometimes when people say little things, I feel hurt because
I want to be appreciated, not criticized.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To express the
needs and thoughts underlying his or her feelings, the speaker might
have said, “When you received that award, I felt happy because I was
hoping you’d be recognized for all the work you’d put into the
project.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To express the
needs and thoughts underlying his or her feelings, the speaker might
have said, “When you raise your voice, I feel scared because I’m telling
myself someone might get hurt here, and I need to know that we’re all
safe.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that the speaker is
acknowledging responsibility for his or her feelings.</p>
