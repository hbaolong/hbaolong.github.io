<h4 id="conflict-resolution-and-mediation">Conflict Resolution and
Mediation</h4>
<p>Now that you are familiar with the steps involved in Nonviolent
Communication, I want to address how to apply them in resolving
conflicts. These could be conflicts between yourself and someone else,
or you may be asked to—or choose to—involve yourself in a conflict
between others: family members, partners, co-workers, or even strangers
in conflict. Whatever the situation may be, resolving conflicts involves
all the principles I outlined previously in this book: observing,
identifying and expressing feelings, connecting feelings with needs, and
making doable requests of another person using clear, concrete, positive
action language.</p>
<p>Over the course of several decades, I’ve used Nonviolent
Communication to resolve conflicts around the world. I’ve met with
unhappy couples, families, workers and their employers, and ethnic
groups at war with each other. My experience has taught me that it’s
possible to resolve just about any conflict to everybody’s satisfaction.
All it takes is a lot of patience, the willingness to establish a human
connection, the intention to follow NVC principles until you reach a
resolution, and trust that the process will work.</p>
<h5 id="human-connection">Human Connection</h5>
<p>In NVC-style conflict resolution, creating a connection between the
people who are in conflict is the most important thing. This is what
enables all the other steps of NVC to work, because it’s not until you
have forged that connection that each side will seek to know exactly
what the other side is feeling and needing. The parties also need to
know from the start that the objective is not to get the other side to
do what they want them to do. And once the two sides understand that, it
becomes possible—sometimes even easy—to have a conversation about how to
meet their needs.</p>
<p>Creating a connection between people is the most important thing.</p>
<p>With NVC, we’re trying to live a different value system while we are
asking for things to change. What’s most important is that every
connection along the line mirrors the kind of world we’re trying to
create. Each step needs to reflect energetically what we’re after, which
is a holographic image of the quality of relationships we’re trying to
create. In short, how we ask for change reflects the value system we’re
trying to support. When we see the difference between these two
objectives, we consciously refrain from trying to get a person to do
what we want. Instead we work to create that quality of mutual concern
and respect where each party thinks their own needs matter and they are
conscious that their needs and the other person’s well-being are
interdependent. When that happens, it’s amazing how conflicts that
otherwise seem irresolvable are easily resolved.</p>
<p>When I’m asked to resolve a conflict, I work to lead the two sides to
this caring and respectful connection. This is often the tough part.
Once that is accomplished, I help both sides create strategies that will
resolve the conflict to both sides’ satisfaction.</p>
<p>Notice that I use the word satisfaction instead of compromise! Most
attempts at resolution search for compromise, which means everybody
gives something up and neither side is satisfied. NVC is different; our
objective is to meet everyone’s needs fully.</p>
<h5 id="nvc-conflict-resolution-versus-traditional-mediation">NVC
Conflict Resolution versus Traditional Mediation</h5>
<p>Let’s consider the human connection aspect of NVC again, this time
looking at third-party mediation—a person stepping in to resolve a
conflict between two other parties. When I’m working with two people, or
two groups, that have a conflict they haven’t been able to resolve, I
approach this very differently from the way professional mediators often
approach a conflict.</p>
<p>For example, once I was in Austria meeting with a group of
professional mediators who work on many kinds of international
conflicts, including those between unions and management. I described
several conflicts I had mediated, such as one in California between
landowners and migrant workers where there had been considerable
physical violence. And I talked about mediating between two African
tribes (which I discuss fully in my book Speak Peace in a World of
Conflict) and a few other extremely entrenched, dangerous conflicts.</p>
<p>I was asked how much time I give myself to study a situation I was to
mediate. He was referring to the process most mediators use: educating
themselves about the issues involved in the conflict and then mediating
with those issues as the focus instead of focusing on creating a human
connection. In fact, in typical third-party mediation, the conflicting
parties may not even be in the same room. Once, as a participant in
mediation, our party was in one room and the other party was in another
room, with the mediator traveling back and forth between rooms. He’d ask
us, “What do you want them to do?” and he’d take that back to the other
side and see if they were willing to do it. Then he would come back and
say, “They’re unwilling to do that, but how about this?”</p>
<p>Many mediators define their role as a “third head” trying to think of
a way to get everybody to come to an agreement. They are not at all
concerned with creating a quality of connection, thus overlooking the
only conflict resolution tool I have ever known to work. When I
described the NVC method and the role of human connection, one of the
participants at the Austria meeting raised the objection that I was
talking about psychotherapy, and that mediators were not
psychotherapists.</p>
<p>In my experience, connecting people at this level isn’t
psychotherapy; it’s actually the core of mediation because when you make
the connection, the problem solves itself most of the time. Instead of a
third head asking, “What can we agree to here?,” if we had a clear
statement of each person’s needs—what those parties need right now from
each other—we will then discover what can be done to get everybody’s
needs met. These become the strategies the parties agree to implement
after the mediation session concludes and the parties leave the
room.</p>
<p>When you make the connection, the problem usually solves itself.</p>
<h5 id="nvc-conflict-resolution-stepsa-quick-overview">NVC Conflict
Resolution Steps—A Quick Overview</h5>
<p>Before we get deeper into a discussion of some of the other key
elements of conflict resolution, let me give you a thumbnail sketch of
the steps involved in resolving a conflict between ourselves and
somebody else. There are five steps in this process. Either side may
express their needs first, but for the sake of simplicity in this
overview, let’s assume we begin with our needs.</p>
<p>First, we express our own needs.</p>
<p>Second, we search for the real needs of the other person, no matter
how they are expressing themselves. If they are not expressing a need,
but instead an opinion, judgment, or analysis, we recognize that, and
continue to seek the need behind their words, the need underneath what
they are saying.</p>
<p>Third, we verify that we both accurately recognize the other person’s
needs, and if not, continue to seek the need behind their words.</p>
<p>Fourth, we provide as much empathy as is required for us to mutually
hear each other’s needs accurately.</p>
<p>And fifth, having clarified both parties’ needs in the situation, we
propose strategies for resolving the conflict, framing them in positive
action language.</p>
<p>Throughout, we’re listening to each other with utmost care, avoiding
the use of language that implies wrongness on either side.</p>
<p>Avoid the use of language that implies wrongness.</p>
<h5 id="on-needs-strategies-and-analysis">On Needs, Strategies, and
Analysis</h5>
<p>Since the understanding and expression of needs are essential to
resolving conflicts through NVC, let us review this vital concept which
has been emphasized throughout this book, and particularly in Chapter
5.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, needs are the resources life requires to sustain
itself. We all have physical needs: air, water, food, rest. And we have
psychological needs such as understanding, support, honesty, and
meaning. I believe that all people basically have the same needs
regardless of nationality, religion, gender, income, education, etc.</p>
<p>Next, let’s consider the difference between a person’s needs and his
or her strategy for fulfilling them. It is important, when resolving
conflicts, that we can clearly recognize the difference between needs
and strategies.</p>
<p>Many of us have great difficulty expressing our needs: we have been
taught by society to criticize, insult, and otherwise (mis)communicate
in ways that keep us apart. In a conflict, both parties usually spend
too much time intent on proving themselves right, and the other party
wrong, rather than paying attention to their own and the other’s needs.
And such verbal conflicts can far too easily escalate into violence—and
even war.</p>
<p>In order not to confuse needs and strategies, it is important to
recall that needs contain no reference to anybody taking any particular
action. On the other hand, strategies, which may appear in the form of
requests, desires, wants, and “solutions,” refer to specific actions
that specific people may take.</p>
<p>For example, I once met with a couple who had just about given up on
their marriage. I asked the husband what needs of his weren’t being
fulfilled in the marriage. He said, “I need to get out of this
marriage.” What he was describing was a specific person (himself) taking
a specific action (leaving the marriage). He wasn’t expressing a need;
he was identifying a strategy.</p>
<p>I pointed this out to the husband and suggested that he first clarify
his and his wife’s needs before undertaking the strategy of “getting out
of this marriage.” After both of them had connected with their own and
each other’s needs, they discovered that these needs could be met with
strategies other than ending the marriage. The husband acknowledged his
needs for appreciation and understanding for the stress generated by his
rather demanding job; the wife recognized her needs for closeness and
connection in a situation where she experienced her husband’s job
occupying much of his time.</p>
<p>Once they truly understood their mutual needs, this husband and wife
were able to arrive at a set of agreements that satisfied both their
needs while working around the demands of the husband’s job.</p>
<p>In the case of another couple, the lack of “needs literacy” took the
form of confusion between the expression of needs and the expression of
analysis, and ultimately led to their inflicting physical violence on
each other. I was invited to mediate in this situation at the end of a
workplace training when a man tearfully described his situation and
asked if he and his wife could speak with me in private.</p>
<p>I agreed to meet them at their home, and opened the evening by
saying: “I’m aware that you’re both in a lot of pain. Let’s begin with
each of you expressing whatever needs of yours aren’t being fulfilled in
your relationship. Once you understand each other’s needs, I’m confident
we can work on strategies to meet those needs.”</p>
<p>Not being “needs literate,” the husband started off by telling his
wife, “The problem with you is that you’re totally insensitive to my
needs.” She answered in the same manner, “That’s typical of you to say
unfair things like that!”</p>
<p>Instead of expressing needs, they were doing analysis, which is
easily heard as criticism by a listener. As mentioned earlier in this
book, analyses that imply wrongness are essentially tragic expressions
of unmet needs. In the case of this couple, the husband had a need for
support and understanding but expressed it in terms of the wife’s
“insensitivity.” The wife also had a need for being accurately
understood, but she expressed it in terms of the husband’s “unfairness.”
It took a while to move through the layers of needs on the part of both
husband and wife, but only through truly acknowledging and appreciating
each other’s needs were they finally able to begin the process of
exploring strategies to address their long-standing conflicts.</p>
<p>I once worked with a company where both morale and productivity took
a dive due to a very disturbing conflict. Two factions in the same
department were fighting over which software to use, generating strong
emotions on both sides. One faction had worked especially hard to
develop the software that was presently in use, and wanted to see its
continued use. The other faction had strong emotions tied up in creating
new software.</p>
<p>I started by asking each side to tell me what needs of theirs would
be better fulfilled by the software they advocated. Their response was
to offer an intellectual analysis that the other side received as
criticism. A member on the side that favored new software said: “We can
continue to be overly conservative, but if we do that, I think we could
be out of work in the future. Progress means that we take some risks,
and dare to show that we are beyond old-fashioned ways of doing things.”
A member of the opposing faction responded, “But I think that
impulsively grabbing for every new thing that comes along is not in our
best interest.” They acknowledged that they had been repeating these
same analyses for months and were getting nowhere other than increasing
tension for themselves.</p>
<p>Intellectual analysis is often received as criticism.</p>
<p>When we don’t know how to directly and clearly express what we need,
but can only make analyses of others that sound like criticism to them,
wars are never far away—whether verbal, psychological, or physical.</p>
<p>Sensing Others’ Needs, No Matter What They’re Saying</p>
<p>To resolve conflicts using NVC, we need to train ourselves to hear
people expressing needs regardless of how they do the expressing. If we
really want to be of assistance to others, the first thing to learn is
to translate any message into an expression of a need. The message might
take the form of silence, denial, a judgmental remark, a gesture—or,
hopefully, a request. We hone our skills to hear the need within every
message, even if at first we have to rely on guesses.</p>
<p>For example, in the middle of a conversation, if I ask the other
person something about what they’ve just said, and I am met with “That’s
a stupid question,” I hear them expressing a need in the form of a
judgment of me. I proceed to guess what that need might be—maybe the
question I asked did not fulfill their need to be understood. Or if I
ask my partner to talk about the stress in our relationship and they
answer, “I don’t want to talk about it,” I may sense that their need is
for protection from what they imagine could happen if we were to
communicate about our relationship. So this is our work: learning to
recognize the need in statements that don’t overtly express any need. It
takes practice, and it always involves some guessing. Once we sense what
the other person needs, we can check in with them, and then help them
put their need into words. If we are able to truly hear their need, a
new level of connection is forged—a critical piece that moves the
conflict toward successful resolution.</p>
<p>Learn to hear needs regardless of how people express them.</p>
<p>In workshops for married couples, I often look for the couple with
the longest unresolved conflict to demonstrate my prediction that, once
each side can state the other side’s needs, it would take no more than
twenty minutes for the conflict to come to a resolution. Once there was
a couple whose marriage suffered thirty-nine years of conflict about
money. Six months into the marriage, the wife had twice overdrawn their
checking account whereupon the husband took control of the finances and
would no longer let her write checks. The two of them had never stopped
arguing about it since.</p>
<p>The wife challenged my prediction, saying that even though they had a
good marriage and can communicate well, it wouldn’t be possible for
their historically entrenched conflict to resolve so quickly.</p>
<p>I invited her to begin by telling me if she knew what her husband’s
needs were in this conflict.</p>
<p>She replied, “He obviously doesn’t want me to spend any money.”</p>
<p>To which her husband exclaimed: “That’s ridiculous!”</p>
<p>In stating that her husband didn’t want her to spend any money, the
wife was identifying what I call a strategy. Even if she had been
accurate in guessing her husband’s strategy, she had nowhere identified
his need. Here again is the key distinction. By my definition, a need
doesn’t refer to a specific action, such as spending or not spending
money. I told the wife that all people share the same needs, and if she
could only understand her husband’s needs, the issue would be resolved.
When encouraged again to state her husband’s needs, she replied, “He is
just like his father,” describing how his father had been reluctant to
spend money. At this point, she was making an analysis.</p>
<p>I stopped her to ask again, “What was his need?”</p>
<p>It became clear that, even after thirty-nine years of “communicating
well,” she still had no idea what his needs were.</p>
<p>I then turned to the husband. “Since your wife isn’t in touch with
what your needs are, why don’t you tell her? What needs are you meeting
by keeping the checkbook from her?”</p>
<p>Criticism and diagnosis get in the way of peaceful resolution of
conflicts.</p>
<p>To which he responded, “Marshall, she’s a wonderful wife, a wonderful
mother. But when it comes to money, she’s totally irresponsible.” His
use of diagnosis (“She is irresponsible.”) is reflective of language
that gets in the way of peaceful resolution of conflicts. When either
side hears itself criticized, diagnosed, or interpreted, the energy of
the situation will likely turn toward self-defense and
counter-accusations rather than toward resolution.</p>
<p>I tried to hear the feeling and need behind him stating that his wife
was irresponsible: “Are you feeling scared because you have a need to
protect your family economically?” He agreed that this was indeed the
case. Admittedly, I had merely guessed correctly, but I didn’t have to
get it right the first time because even if I had guessed wrong, I would
still have been focusing on his needs—and that’s the heart of the
matter. In fact, when we reflect back incorrect guesses to others, it
may help them get in touch with their true needs. It takes them out of
analysis toward greater connection to life.</p>
<p>Have the Needs Been Heard?</p>
<p>The husband had finally acknowledged his need: to keep his family
safe. The next step is to ascertain that the wife heard that need. This
is a crucial stage in conflict resolution. We must not assume that when
one party expresses a need clearly, that the other party hears it
accurately. I asked the wife, “Can you tell me back what you heard to be
your husband’s needs in this situation?”</p>
<p>“Well, just because I overdrew the bank account a couple of times, it
doesn’t mean I’m going to continue doing it.”</p>
<p>Her response was not unusual. When we have pain built up over many
years, it can get in the way of our ability to hear clearly, even when
what is being expressed is clear to others. To continue, I said to the
wife: “I’d like to tell you what I heard your husband say, and I’d like
you to repeat it back. I heard that your husband says he has a need to
protect the family, and he’s scared because he wants to be sure that the
family is protected.”</p>
<h5 id="empathy-to-ease-the-pain-that-prevents-hearing">Empathy to Ease
the Pain That Prevents Hearing</h5>
<p>But she was still in too much pain to hear me. This brings up another
skill that is needed if we are to effectively engage the NVC process of
conflict resolution. When people are upset, they often need empathy
before they can hear what is being said to them. In this instance, I
changed course: instead of trying to have her repeat what her husband
had said, I tried to understand the pain she was in—the pain that kept
her from hearing him. Especially if there is a long history of pain, it
is important to offer enough empathy so that the parties feel reassured
that their pain is being recognized and understood.</p>
<p>People often need empathy before they are able to hear what is being
said.</p>
<p>When I addressed the wife with empathy, “I sense that you’re feeling
really hurt and you need to be trusted that you can learn from past
experience,” the expression in her eyes showed me how much she needed
that understanding. “Yes, exactly,” she replied, but when asked to
repeat back what her husband had said, she answered, “He thinks I spend
too much money.”</p>
<p>Just as we are not trained to express our own needs, most of us have
not been trained in hearing the needs of others. All this wife could
hear was criticism or diagnosis on part of her husband. I encouraged her
to try to simply hear his needs. After I repeated his need—for safety
for his family—two more times, she finally was able to hear it. Then,
after a few more rounds, they were both able to hear each other’s needs.
And just as I had predicted, once they understood—for the first time in
thirty-nine years—each other’s needs concerning the checkbook, it took
less than twenty minutes to find practical ways to meet both their
needs.</p>
<p>The more experience I have gained in mediating conflicts over the
years and the more I’ve seen what leads families to argue and nations to
go to war, the more convinced I am that most schoolchildren could solve
these conflicts. If we could just say, “Here are the needs of both
sides. Here are the resources. What can be done to meet these needs?,”
conflicts would be easily resolved. But instead, our thinking is focused
on dehumanizing one another with labels and judgments until even the
simplest of conflicts becomes very difficult to solve. NVC helps us
avoid that trap, thereby enhancing the chances of reaching a satisfying
resolution.</p>
<h5
id="using-present-and-positive-action-language-to-resolve-conflict">Using
Present and Positive Action Language to Resolve Conflict</h5>
<p>Although I addressed the use of present, positive action language in
Chapter 6, I’d like to present a few more examples to demonstrate its
importance in resolving conflicts. Once both parties have connected with
each other’s needs, the next step is to arrive at strategies that meet
those needs. It’s important to avoid moving hastily into strategies, as
this may result in a compromise that lacks the deep quality of authentic
resolution that is possible. By fully hearing each other’s needs before
addressing solutions, parties in conflict are much more likely to adhere
to the agreements they make to each other. The process of resolving
conflict has to end with actions that meet everybody’s needs. It is the
presentation of strategies in clear, present, positive action language
that moves conflicts toward resolution.</p>
<p>A present language statement refers to what is wanted at this moment.
For example, one party might say, “I’d like you to tell me if you would
be willing to—” and describe the action they’d like the other party to
take. The use of a present language request that begins with “Would you
be willing to …” helps foster a respectful discussion. If the other side
answers that they are not willing, it invites the next step of
understanding what prevents their willingness.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the absence of present language, a request such
as “I’d like you to go to the show with me Saturday night” fails to
convey what’s being asked of the listener at that moment. The use of
present language to hone such a request, for example, “Would you be
willing to tell me whether you will go to the show with me Saturday
night?,” supports clarity and ongoing connection in the exchange. We can
further clarify the request by indicating what we may want from the
other person in the present moment, “Would you be willing to tell me how
you feel about going to the show with me Saturday night?” The clearer we
are regarding the response we want right now from the other party, the
more effectively we move the conflict toward resolution.</p>
<h5 id="using-action-verbs">Using Action Verbs</h5>
<p>In Chapter 6, we touched upon the role of action language in forming
NVC requests. In situations of conflict, it is especially important to
focus on what we do want rather than what we do not want. Talking about
what one doesn’t want can easily create confusion and resistance among
conflicting parties.</p>
<p>Action language requires the use of action verbs, while also avoiding
language that obscures, or language that can readily be inferred as an
attack. I’d like to illustrate this with a situation where a woman
expressed a need for understanding that wasn’t being met in her primary
relationship. After her partner was able to accurately hear and reflect
back the need for understanding, I turned to the woman and said, “Okay,
let’s get down to strategies. What do you want from your partner in
order to meet your need for understanding?” She faced her partner and
said, “I’d like you to listen to me when I talk to you.” “I do listen to
you when you talk!,” the partner retorted. It’s not unusual, if someone
tells us they’d like us to listen when they are talking, for us to hear
accusations and thus feel some resentment.</p>
<p>Action language requires the use of action verbs.</p>
<p>They went back and forth, with the partner repeating, “I do listen,”
and the woman countering, “No, you don’t.” They told me they’d had this
“conversation” for twelve years, a situation that is typical in
conflicts when parties use vague words like “listen” to express
strategies. I suggest instead the use of action verbs to capture
something that we can see or hear happening—something that can be
recorded with a video camera. “Listening” occurs inside a person’s head;
another person cannot see whether it is happening or not. One way to
determine that someone is actually listening is to have that person
reflect back what had been said: we ask the person to take an action
that we ourselves can see or hear. If the other party can tell us what
was just said, we know that person heard and was indeed listening to
us.</p>
<p>In another conflict between a husband and wife, the wife wanted to
know that her husband respected her choices. Once she expressed her need
successfully, her next step was to get clear on her strategy for meeting
that need and to make a request of the husband. She told him, “I want
you to give me the freedom to grow and be myself.” “I do,” he replied,
and just as with the other couple, this was followed by a fruitless
volley of “Yes, I do,” and “No, you don’t.”</p>
<p>Non-action language, such as “Give me the freedom to grow” often
exacerbates conflict. In this instance, the husband heard himself being
judged as domineering. I pointed out to the wife that it wasn’t clear to
her husband what she wanted: “Please tell him exactly what you’d like
him to do to meet your need to have your choices respected.”</p>
<p>“I want you to let me—,” she began. I interrupted that “let” was too
vague: “What do you really mean when you say you want somebody to ‘let’
you?”</p>
<p>After reflecting for a few seconds, she arrived at an important
understanding. She acknowledged that what she really meant when she said
things like “I want you to let me be” and “I want you to give me the
freedom to grow” is for her husband to tell her that no matter what she
did, it was okay.</p>
<p>When she got clear as to what she was actually requesting—for him to
tell her something—she recognized that what she wanted did not leave him
much freedom to be himself and to have his choices respected. And
maintaining respect is a key element in successful conflict
resolution.</p>
<p>Maintaining respect is a key element in successful conflict
resolution.</p>
<h5 id="translating-no">Translating “No”</h5>
<p>When we express a request, it’s very important to be respectful of
the other person’s reaction, whether or not they agree to our request.
Many mediations I have witnessed consist of waiting for people to wear
down to the point where they’ll accept any compromise. This is very
different from a resolution in which everyone’s needs are met and nobody
experiences loss.</p>
<p>In Chapter 8, we discovered the importance of not hearing “no” as
rejection. Listening carefully to the message behind the “no” helps us
understand the other person’s needs: When they say “no,” they’re saying
they have a need that keeps them from saying “yes” to what we are
asking. If we can hear the need behind a “no,” we can continue the
conflict resolution process—maintaining our focus on finding a way to
meet everybody’s needs—even if the other party says “no” to the
particular strategy we presented them.</p>
<h5 id="nvc-and-the-mediator-role">NVC and the Mediator Role</h5>
<p>Although in this chapter I have offered examples from mediations I’ve
facilitated between conflicting parties, the focus so far has been on
how to apply these skills when resolving conflicts between ourselves and
another person. There are, however, a few things to keep in mind at
those times when we want to use our NVC tools to help two other parties
reach a resolution and we take on the role of mediator.</p>
<p>Your Role, and Trust in the Process</p>
<p>When entering a conflict process as mediator, a good place to start
might be to assure the people in conflict that we are not there to take
sides, but to support them in hearing each other, and to help guide them
to a solution that meets everyone’s needs. Depending on the
circumstances, we may also want to convey our confidence that, if the
parties follow the steps of NVC, both of their needs will be met in the
end.</p>
<p>Remember: It’s Not About Us</p>
<p>At the beginning of the chapter, I emphasized that the objective is
not to get the other person to do what we want them to do. This also
applies to mediating someone else’s conflict. Though we may have our own
wishes for how the conflict is resolved—especially if the conflict is
between family, friends, or co-workers—we need to remember that we are
not here to accomplish our own goals. The mediator’s role is to create
an environment in which the parties can connect, express their needs,
understand each other’s needs, and arrive at strategies to meet those
needs.</p>
<p>The objective is not to get the parties to do what we want them to
do.</p>
<p>Emergency First-Aid Empathy</p>
<p>As mediator, I stress my intention for both parties to be fully and
accurately understood. Despite that, as soon as I express empathy toward
one side, it is not unusual for the other side to immediately accuse me
of favoritism. At this time, what’s called for is emergency first-aid
empathy. This might sound like “So you’re really annoyed, and you need
some assurance that you’re going to get your side on the table?”</p>
<p>Once the empathy has been expressed, I remind them that everyone will
have the opportunity to be heard, and their turn will be next. It is
then helpful to confirm they are in agreement with waiting by asking,
for example, “Are you feeling reassured about that, or would you like
more reassurance that your opportunity to be heard will come soon?”</p>
<p>We may need to do this repeatedly to keep the mediation on track.</p>
<p>Keep Track: Follow the Bouncing Ball</p>
<p>When we are mediating, we have to “keep score” by paying careful
attention to what has been said, making sure both parties have the
opportunity to express their needs, listen to the other person’s needs,
and make requests. We also need to “follow the bouncing ball”: being
conscious of where one party left off so we can return to what that
party said after the other party has been heard.</p>
<p>This can be challenging, especially when things get heated. In such
situations, I often find it helpful to use a white board or flip chart
to capture the essence of what was spoken by the last speaker who had
opportunity to express a feeling or need.</p>
<p>This form of visual tracking can also serve to reassure both parties
that their needs will be addressed because so often before we have a
chance to fully draw out one party’s needs, the other will be jumping
ahead to express themselves. Taking the time to note those needs in a
way that is visible to everyone present can help the listener feel
comfortable that their own needs will also be addressed. In this way,
everyone can more easily offer their full attention to what is being
expressed in the current moment.</p>
<p>Keep the Conversation in the Present</p>
<p>Another important quality to bring to mediation is awareness of the
moment: who needs what right now? What are their present requests?
Maintaining this awareness requires a lot of practice in being present
in the moment, which is something most of us have never been taught to
do.</p>
<p>As we move through the mediation process, it is likely that we will
hear a lot of discussion about what happened in the past and what people
want to happen differently in the future. However, conflict resolution
can only happen right now, so now is where we need to focus.</p>
<p>Keep Things Moving</p>
<p>Another mediation task is to keep the conversation from getting
bogged down; this can happen very easily, as people often think that if
they just tell that same story one more time, they will finally be
understood and the other person will do what they want.</p>
<p>To keep things moving, the mediator needs to ask effective questions,
and when necessary, maintain or even speed up the pace. Once, when I was
scheduled to lead a workshop in a small town, the event organizer asked
if I would help him with a personal dispute related to the division of
family property. I agreed to mediate, aware there was only a three-hour
window in between workshops to do so.</p>
<p>The family dispute centered on a man who owned a large farm and was
about to retire. His two sons were at war over how the property was to
be divided. They hadn’t spoken in eight years even though they lived
close to each other at the same end of the farm. I met the brothers,
their wives, and their sister, all of whom were involved in this set of
complicated legal matters and eight years of pain.</p>
<p>In order to get things moving—and to stay on schedule—I had to speed
up the mediation process. To keep them from spending time telling the
same stories over and over, I asked one of the brothers if I could play
his role; then I would switch and play the part of the other
brother.</p>
<p>Use role-play to speed up the mediation process.</p>
<p>As I was going through my role-play, I joked about wanting to see if
I was playing the part right by asking if I could check in with my
“director.” Looking over at the brother whose part I had been playing, I
saw something I wasn’t prepared for: he had tears in his eyes. I guessed
that he was experiencing deep empathy, both with himself from my playing
his role, as well as for his brother’s pain, which he had not seen until
then. The next day, the father approached me, also with tearful eyes, to
say that the night before the whole family had gone out to dinner for
the first time in eight years. Though the conflict had persisted for
years, with lawyers on both sides working unsuccessfully to come to
agreement, it became simple to resolve once the brothers heard each
other’s pain and needs as revealed through the role-playing. If I had
waited for both of them to tell their stories, the resolution would have
taken much longer.</p>
<p>When relying on this method, I periodically turn to the person whose
role I’m playing, addressing them as “my director” to see how I am
doing. For a while I thought I had acting talent because of how often I
find them crying and saying, “That’s exactly what I’ve been trying to
say!” However, when I started training others in role-playing, I now
know that any of us can do it as long as we are in touch with our own
needs. No matter what else is going on, we all have the same needs.
Needs are universal.</p>
<p>I sometimes work with people who have been raped or tortured and
where the perpetrator is absent, I would assume their role.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the victim is surprised to hear me in the role-play saying
the same thing they had heard from their perpetrator, and press me with
the question, “But how did you know?” I believe the answer to that
question is that I know because I am that person. And so are we all. As
we apply a literacy of feelings and needs, we are not thinking about the
issues, but simply putting ourselves in the other person’s shoes, trying
to be that person. “Getting the part right” is not in our thoughts,
although from time to time we check in with the “director” because we
don’t always get it right. Nobody gets it right all the time, and that’s
fine. If we’re off the mark, the person whom we are playing will let us
know one way or another. We are thus offered another opportunity to make
a closer guess.</p>
<p>Role-play is simply putting ourselves in the other person’s
shoes.</p>
<p>Interrupting</p>
<p>Sometimes mediations get heated, with people shouting at or talking
over one another. To keep the process on track under such circumstances,
we need to get comfortable with interrupting. Once when I was mediating
in Israel, and having a difficult time because my translator was too
polite, I finally taught him to be nasty: “Shut them up!,” I instructed.
“Tell them to wait until we at least get the translation out before they
go back to screaming at each other.” So when both sides are screaming or
talking at the same time, I insert myself: “Excuse me, excuse me, excuse
me!” I repeat this as loudly and as often as necessary until I regain
their attention.</p>
<p>When we are grabbing their attention, we have to be quick. If the
person reacts with anger when we interrupt, we can sense that they are
in too much pain to hear us. This is the time for emergency first-aid
empathy. Here is what it might sound like, using an example from a
business meeting.</p>
<p>Speaker: This happens all the time! They’ve already called three
meetings, and each time there is some new rationale as to why it can’t
be done. Last time they even signed an agreement! Now another promise
and it will be just that: another promise! There’s little point in
working with people who …</p>
<p>Mediator: Excuse me, excuse me, EXCUSE ME! Could you tell me back
what the other person said?</p>
<p>Speaker: (realizing he had not listened to what had been said)
No!</p>
<p>Mediator: So you’re feeling so full of distrust right now and really
need some trust that people will do what they say?</p>
<p>Speaker: Well, of course but …</p>
<p>Mediator: So could you tell me what you heard them say? Let me repeat
it for you. I hear the other side saying they have a real need for
integrity. Could you just say it back so I’m sure we all understand each
other?</p>
<p>Speaker: (silence)</p>
<p>Mediator: No? Then let me say it again. And we say it again.</p>
<p>We might view our role as that of a translator—translating each
party’s message so as to be understood by the other. I ask them to get
used to my interrupting for the sake of resolving the conflict. When I
do interrupt, I also check that the speaker feels that I’m translating
them accurately. I translate many messages even if I am only guessing,
but the speaker is always the final authority on the accuracy of my
translation.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that the purpose of interrupting and
grabbing people’s attention back in this way is to restore the process
of making observations, identifying and expressing feelings, connecting
feelings with needs, and making doable requests using clear, concrete,
positive action language.</p>
<p>The purpose of interrupting is to restore the process.</p>
<h5 id="when-people-say-no-to-meeting-face-to-face">When People Say “No”
to Meeting Face to Face</h5>
<p>I am optimistic about what can happen when we bring people together
to express their needs and requests. However, one of the biggest
problems I’ve encountered is simply getting access to both parties.
Because it occasionally takes time for a party to become clear about its
own needs, mediators require adequate access in order for both parties
to express, and then receive each other’s needs. Oftentimes, what we
hear from someone in conflict is: “No, there’s no use talking—they won’t
listen. I’ve tried to talk and it doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>To solve this problem I’ve sought strategies to resolve conflicts
where people in conflict are unwilling to meet. One method that shows
promising results relies on the use of an audio recorder. I work with
each party separately while playing the role of the other side. If there
are two people in our own lives who are in too much pain to be willing
to meet, this would be an option for us to consider.</p>
<p>As an example, a woman was suffering heavily from a conflict with her
husband, particularly from the way he was directing anger toward her.
First, I listened in a way that supported her to clearly express her
needs and to experience being received with respectful understanding.
Then, I took on the role of her husband, and asked her to listen to me
as I expressed what I guessed to be the husband’s needs.</p>
<p>The needs of the conflicting parties having been clearly conveyed in
this role-play, I asked the woman to share the recording with her
husband for his reaction.</p>
<p>Because I had, in this case, been accurate in guessing the husband’s
needs, he experienced huge relief when listening to the recording. With
the increased trust that came from hearing himself understood, he later
agreed to come in so we could work together until the two of them found
ways of meeting their needs in mutually respectful ways.</p>
<p>When the hardest thing about resolving a conflict is getting the
parties together in the same room, the use of recorded role-plays may be
the answer.</p>
<h5
id="informal-mediation-sticking-our-nose-in-other-peoples-business">Informal
Mediation: Sticking Our Nose in Other People’s Business</h5>
<p>Informal mediation is a polite way to refer to mediating in
situations where we’ve not been invited to do so. In so many words,
we’re sticking our nose in other people’s business.</p>
<p>I was shopping in a grocery store one day when I saw a woman strike
her toddler. She was about to do it again when I jumped in. She didn’t
ask, “Marshall, would you mediate between us?” Another time I was
walking in the streets of Paris; a woman was walking alongside me when a
rather inebriated man ran up from behind, turned her around, and slapped
her in the face. As there wasn’t time for me to talk with this man, I
resorted to the protective use of force by restraining him just as he
was about to strike her again. I inserted myself between the two, and
stuck my nose in their business. On another occasion, during a business
meeting, I watched two factions in a repetitious exchange, arguing back
and forth over an age-old issue and again I stuck my nose in between
them.</p>
<p>When we witness behaviors that raise concern in us—unless it is a
situation that calls for the protective use of force as described in
Chapter 12—the first thing we do is to empathize with the needs of the
person who is behaving in the way we dislike. In the first situation, if
we wanted to see more violence directed at the toddler, we could,
instead of offering empathy to the mother, say something to imply that
she was wrong to hit the child. Such a response on our part would only
escalate the situation.</p>
<p>We need to be well practiced at hearing the need in any message.</p>
<p>In order to be truly helpful to people in whose business we are
sticking our nose we need to have developed an extensive literacy
regarding needs, and be well practiced at hearing the need in any
message, including the need underneath the act of slapping another
person. And we need to be practiced in verbal empathy such that the
people sense that we are connected with their need.</p>
<p>We need to remember, when we choose to stick our nose in someone’s
business, it’s not enough to simply support someone to get in touch with
his or her own needs. We aim to practice all the other steps covered in
this chapter. For example, after empathizing, we may tell the toddler’s
mother that we care about safety and have a need to protect people, and
then request her willingness to try another strategy to meet her need
with her child.</p>
<p>We refrain, however, from mentioning our own needs regarding the
person’s behavior until it is clear to them that we understand and care
about his or her needs. Otherwise people will not care about our needs
nor will they see that their needs and ours are one and the same. As
expressed so beautifully by Alice Walker in The Color Purple: “One day
when I was sitting quiet and feeling like a motherless child, which I
was, it come to me: that feeling of being part of everything, not
separate at all. I knew that if I cut a tree, my arm would bleed.”</p>
<p>Unless we make sure that both sides are aware of their own as well as
each other’s needs, it will be hard for us to succeed when we stick our
nose in other people’s business. We are likely to get caught up in
scarcity thinking—seeing only the importance of our own needs being met.
When scarcity thinking then gets mixed with right-and-wrong thinking,
any of us can become militant and violent, and blinded to even the most
obvious solutions. At that point, the conflict seems unresolvable—and it
will be if we don’t connect with the other person by first offering
empathy without focusing on our own needs.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>The use of NVC to resolve conflict differs from traditional mediation
methods; instead of deliberating over issues, strategies, and means of
compromise, we concentrate foremost on identifying the needs of both
parties, and only then seek strategies to fulfill those needs.</p>
<p>We start by forging a human connection between the parties in
conflict. Then we ensure that both parties have the opportunity to fully
express their needs, that they carefully listen to the other person’s
needs, and that once the needs have been heard, they clearly express
doable action steps to meet those needs. We avoid judging or analyzing
the conflict and instead remain focused on needs.</p>
<p>When one party is in too much pain to hear the needs of the other, we
extend empathy, taking as long as necessary to ensure that the person
knows their pain is heard. We do not hear “no” as a rejection but rather
as an expression of the need that is keeping the person from saying
“yes.” Only after all needs have been mutually heard, do we progress to
the solutions stage: making doable requests using positive, action
language.</p>
<p>When we assume the role of mediating a conflict between two other
parties, the same principles apply. In addition, we keep careful track
of progress, extend empathy where needed, keep the conversation focused
on the present, moving it forward, and interrupting where necessary to
return to the process.</p>
<p>With these tools and understanding, we can practice and help others
resolve even long-standing conflicts to their mutual satisfaction.</p>
