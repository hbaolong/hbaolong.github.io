<h4 id="communication-that-blocks-compassion">Communication That Blocks
Compassion</h4>
<p>Do not judge, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so
you will yourselves be judged…</p>
<p>—Holy Bible, Matthew 7:1</p>
<p>In studying the question of what alienates us from our natural I
state of compassion, I have identified specific forms of language and
communication that I believe contribute to our behaving violently toward
each other and ourselves. I use the term life-alienating communication
to refer to these forms of communication.</p>
<p>Certain ways of communicating alienate us from our natural state of
compassion.</p>
<h5 id="moralistic-judgments">Moralistic Judgments</h5>
<p>One kind of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic
judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of people who
don’t act in harmony with our values. Such judgments are reflected in
language: “The problem with you is that you’re too selfish.” “She’s
lazy.” “They’re prejudiced.” “It’s inappropriate.” Blame, insults,
put-downs, labels, criticism, comparisons, and diagnoses are all forms
of judgment.</p>
<p>The Sufi poet Rumi once wrote, “Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and
right-doing, there is a field. I’ll meet you there.” Life-alienating
communication, however, traps us in a world of ideas about rightness and
wrongness—a world of judgments. It is a language rich with words that
classify and dichotomize people and their actions. When we speak this
language, we judge others and their behavior while preoccupying
ourselves with who’s good, bad, normal, abnormal, responsible,
irresponsible, smart, ignorant, etc.</p>
<p>In the world of judgments, our concern centers on “who is what.”</p>
<p>Long before I reached adulthood, I learned to communicate in an
impersonal way that did not require me to reveal what was going on
inside myself. When I encountered people or behaviors I either didn’t
like or didn’t understand, I would react in terms of their wrongness. If
my teachers assigned a task I didn’t want to do, they were “mean” or
“unreasonable.” If someone pulled out in front of me in traffic, my
reaction would be, “You idiot!” When we speak this language, we think
and communicate in terms of what’s wrong with others for behaving in
certain ways or, occasionally, what’s wrong with ourselves for not
understanding or responding as we would like. Our attention is focused
on classifying, analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness rather
than on what we and others need and are not getting. Thus if my partner
wants more affection than I’m giving her, she is “needy and dependent.”
But if I want more affection than she is giving me, then she is “aloof
and insensitive.” If my colleague is more concerned about details than I
am, he is “picky and compulsive.” On the other hand, if I am more
concerned about details than he is, he is “sloppy and disorganized.”</p>
<p>Analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs and
values.</p>
<p>It is my belief that all such analyses of other human beings are
tragic expressions of our own values and needs. They are tragic because
when we express our values and needs in this form, we increase
defensiveness and resistance among the very people whose behaviors are
of concern to us. Or, if people do agree to act in harmony with our
values, they will likely do so out of fear, guilt, or shame because they
concur with our analysis of their wrongness.</p>
<p>We all pay dearly when people respond to our values and needs not out
of a desire to give from the heart, but out of fear, guilt, or shame.
Sooner or later, we will experience the consequences of diminished
goodwill on the part of those who comply with our values out of a sense
of either external or internal coercion. They, too, pay emotionally, for
they are likely to feel resentment and decreased self-esteem when they
respond to us out of fear, guilt, or shame. Furthermore, each time
others associate us in their minds with any of those feelings, the
likelihood of their responding compassionately to our needs and values
in the future decreases.</p>
<p>It is important here not to confuse value judgments and moralistic
judgments. All of us make value judgments as to the qualities we value
in life; for example, we might value honesty, freedom, or peace. Value
judgments reflect our beliefs of how life can best be served. We make
moralistic judgments of people and behaviors that fail to support our
value judgments; for example, “Violence is bad. People who kill others
are evil.” Had we been raised speaking a language that facilitated the
expression of compassion, we would have learned to articulate our needs
and values directly, rather than to insinuate wrongness when they have
not been met. For example, instead of “Violence is bad,” we might say
instead, “I am fearful of the use of violence to resolve conflicts; I
value the resolution of human conflicts through other means.”</p>
<p>The relationship between language and violence is the subject of
psychology professor O.J. Harvey’s research at the University of
Colorado. He took random samples of pieces of literature from many
countries around the world and tabulated the frequency of words that
classify and judge people. His study shows a high correlation between
frequent use of such words and frequency of incidents. It does not
surprise me to hear that there is considerably less violence in cultures
where people think in terms of human needs than in cultures where people
label one another as “good” or “bad” and believe that the “bad” ones
deserve to be punished. In 75 percent of the television programs shown
during hours when American children are most likely to be watching, the
hero either kills people or beats them up. This violence typically
constitutes the “climax” of the show. Viewers, having been taught that
bad guys deserve to be punished, take pleasure in watching this
violence.</p>
<p>Classifying and judging people promotes violence.</p>
<p>At the root of much, if not all, violence—whether verbal,
psychological, or physical, whether among family members, tribes, or
nations—is a kind of thinking that attributes the cause of conflict to
wrongness in one’s adversaries, and a corresponding inability to think
of oneself or others in terms of vulnerability—that is, what one might
be feeling, fearing, yearning for, missing, etc. We saw this dangerous
way of thinking during the Cold War. Our leaders viewed the U.S.S.R. as
an “evil empire” bent on destroying the American way of life. Soviet
leaders referred to the people of the United States as “imperialist
oppressors” who were trying to subjugate them. Neither side acknowledged
the fear lurking behind such labels.</p>
<h5 id="making-comparisons">Making Comparisons</h5>
<p>Another form of judgment is the use of comparisons. In his book How
to Make Yourself Miserable, Dan Greenburg demonstrates through humor the
insidious power that comparative thinking can exert over us. He suggests
that if readers have a sincere desire to make life miserable for
themselves, they might learn to compare themselves to other people. For
those unfamiliar with this practice, he provides a few exercises. The
first one displays full-length pictures of a man and a woman who embody
ideal physical beauty by contemporary media standards. Readers are
instructed to take their own body measurements, compare them to those
superimposed on the pictures of the attractive specimens, and dwell on
the differences.</p>
<p>Comparisons are a form of judgment.</p>
<p>This exercise produces what it promises: we start to feel miserable
as we engage in these comparisons. By the time we’re as depressed as we
think possible, we turn the page to discover that the first exercise was
a mere warm-up. Since physical beauty is relatively superficial,
Greenburg next provides an opportunity to compare ourselves on something
that matters: achievement. He turns to the phone book to give readers a
few random individuals to compare themselves with. The first name he
claims to have pulled out of the phone book is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
Greenburg lists the languages Mozart spoke and the major pieces he had
composed by the time he was a teenager. The exercise then instructs
readers to reflect on their own achievements at their current stage of
life, to compare them with what Mozart had accomplished by age twelve,
and to dwell on the differences.</p>
<p>Even readers who never emerge from the self-induced misery of this
exercise might see how powerfully this type of thinking blocks
compassion, both for oneself and for others.</p>
<h5 id="denial-of-responsibility">Denial of Responsibility</h5>
<p>Another kind of life-alienating communication is denial of
responsibility. Communication is life-alienating when it clouds our
awareness that we are each responsible for our own thoughts, feelings,
and actions. The use of the common expression have to, as in “There are
some things you have to do, whether you like it or not,” illustrates how
personal responsibility for our actions can be obscured in speech. The
phrase makes one feel, as in “You make me feel guilty,” is another
example of how language facilitates denial of personal responsibility
for our own feelings and thoughts.</p>
<p>Our language obscures awareness of personal responsibility.</p>
<p>In her book Eichmann in Jerusalem, which documents the war crimes
trial of Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann, Hannah Arendt quotes Eichmann
saying that he and his fellow officers had their own name for the
responsibility-denying language they used. They called it Amtssprache,
loosely translated into English as “office talk” or “bureaucratese.” For
example, if asked why they took a certain action, the response would be,
“I had to.” If asked why they “had to,” the answer would be, “Superiors’
orders.” “Company policy.” “It was the law.”</p>
<p>We deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause
to factors outside ourselves:</p>
<p>Vague, impersonal forces—“I cleaned my room because I had to.”</p>
<p>Our condition, diagnosis, or personal or psychological history—“I
drink because I am an alcoholic.”</p>
<p>The actions of others—“I hit my child because he ran into the
street.”</p>
<p>The dictates of authority—“I lied to the client because the boss told
me to.”</p>
<p>Group pressure—“I started smoking because all my friends did.”</p>
<p>Institutional policies, rules, and regulations—“I have to suspend you
for this infraction because it’s the school policy.”</p>
<p>Gender roles, social roles, or age roles—”I hate going to work, but I
do it because I am a husband and a father.”</p>
<p>Uncontrollable impulses—“I was overcome by my urge to eat the candy
bar.”</p>
<p>Once, during a discussion among parents and teachers on the dangers
of a language that implies absence of choice, a woman objected angrily,
“But there are some things you have to do whether you like it or not!
And I see nothing wrong with telling my children that there are things
they have to do, too.” Asked for an example of something she “had to
do,” she retorted, “That’s easy! When I leave here tonight, I have to go
home and cook. I hate cooking! I hate it with a passion, but I have been
doing it every day for twenty years, even when I’ve been as sick as a
dog, because it’s one of those things you just have to do.” I told her I
was sad to hear her spending so much of her life doing something she
hated, because she felt compelled to, and I just hoped that she might
find happier possibilities by learning the language of NVC.</p>
<p>I am pleased to report that she was a fast learner. At the end of the
workshop, she actually went home and announced to her family that she no
longer wanted to cook. The opportunity for some feedback from her family
came three weeks later when her two sons arrived at a workshop. I was
curious to know how they had reacted to their mother’s announcement. The
elder son sighed, “Marshall, I just said to myself, ‘Thank God!’” Seeing
my puzzled look, he explained, “I thought to myself, maybe finally she
won’t be complaining at every meal!”</p>
<p>We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language
that acknowledges choice.</p>
<p>Another time, when I was consulting for a school district, a teacher
remarked, “I hate giving grades. I don’t think they are helpful and they
create a lot of anxiety on the part of students. But I have to give
grades: it’s the district policy.” We had just been practicing how to
introduce language in the classroom that heightens consciousness of
responsibility for one’s actions. I suggested that the teacher translate
the statement “I have to give grades because it’s district policy” to “I
choose to give grades because I want …” She answered without hesitation,
“I choose to give grades because I want to keep my job,” while hastening
to add, “But I don’t like saying it that way. It makes me feel so
responsible for what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for
how we behave, think, and feel.</p>
<p>“That’s why I want you to do it that way,” I replied.</p>
<p>I share the sentiments of French novelist and journalist George
Bernanos when he says,</p>
<p>I have thought for a long time now that if, some day, the increasing
efficiency for the technique of destruction finally causes our species
to disappear from the earth, it will not be cruelty that will be
responsible for our extinction and still less, of course, the
indignation that cruelty awakens and the reprisals and vengeance that it
brings upon itself … but the docility, the lack of responsibility of the
modern man, his base subservient acceptance of every common decree. The
horrors that we have seen, the still greater horrors we shall presently
see, are not signs that rebels, insubordinate, untamable men are
increasing in number throughout the world, but rather that there is a
constant increase in the number of obedient, docile men.</p>
<p>—George Bernanos</p>
<h5 id="other-forms-of-life-alienating-communication">Other Forms of
Life-Alienating Communication</h5>
<p>Communicating our desires as demands is yet another form of language
that blocks compassion. A demand explicitly or implicitly threatens
listeners with blame or punishment if they fail to comply. It is a
common form of communication in our culture, especially among those who
hold positions of authority.</p>
<p>My children gave me some invaluable lessons about demands. Somehow I
had gotten it into my head that, as a parent, my job was to make
demands. I learned, however, that I could make all the demands in the
world but still couldn’t make my children do anything. This is a
humbling lesson in power for those of us who believe that, because we’re
a parent, teacher, or manager, our job is to change other people and
make them behave. Here were these youngsters letting me know that I
couldn’t make them do anything. All I could do was make them wish they
had—through punishment. Then eventually they taught me that any time I
was foolish enough to make them wish they had complied by punishing
them, they had ways of making me wish that I hadn’t!</p>
<p>We can never make people do anything.</p>
<p>We will examine this subject again when we learn to differentiate
requests from demands—an important part of NVC.</p>
<p>The concept that certain actions merit reward while others merit
punishment is also associated with life-alienating communication. This
thinking is expressed by the word deserve as in “He deserves to be
punished for what he did.” It assumes “badness” on the part of people
who behave in certain ways, and it calls for punishment to make them
repent and change their behavior. I believe it is in everyone’s interest
that people change, not in order to avoid punishment, but because they
see the change as benefiting themselves.</p>
<p>Thinking based on “who deserves what” blocks compassionate
communication.</p>
<p>Most of us grew up speaking a language that encourages us to label,
compare, demand, and pronounce judgments rather than to be aware of what
we are feeling and needing. I believe life-alienating communication is
rooted in views of human nature that have exerted their influence for
several centuries. These views stress humans’ innate evil and
deficiency, and a need for education to control our inherently
undesirable nature. Such education often leaves us questioning whether
there is something wrong with whatever feelings and needs we may be
experiencing. We learn early to cut ourselves off from what’s going on
within ourselves.</p>
<p>Life-alienating communication has deep philosophical and political
roots.</p>
<p>Life-alienating communication both stems from and supports
hierarchical or domination societies, where large populations are
controlled by a small number of individuals to those individuals, own
benefit. It would be in the interest of kings, czars, nobles, and so
forth that the masses be educated in a way that renders them slavelike
in mentality. The language of wrongness, should, and have to is
perfectly suited for this purpose: the more people are trained to think
in terms of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness and badness, the
more they are being trained to look outside themselves—to outside
authorities—for the definition of what constitutes right, wrong, good,
and bad. When we are in contact with our feelings and needs, we humans
no longer make good slaves and underlings.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>It is our nature to enjoy giving and receiving compassionately. We
have, however, learned many forms of life-alienating communication that
lead us to speak and behave in ways that injure others and ourselves.
One form of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic
judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of those who don’t
act in harmony with our values. Another is the use of comparisons, which
can block compassion both for others and for ourselves. Life-alienating
communication also obscures our awareness that we are each responsible
for our own thoughts, feelings, and actions. Communicating our desires
in the form of demands is yet another characteristic of language that
blocks compassion.</p>
