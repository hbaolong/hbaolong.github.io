<h4 id="receiving-empathically">Receiving Empathically</h4>
<p>The last four chapters described the four components of NVC: what we
are observing, feeling, and needing, and what we would like to request
to enrich our lives. Now we turn from self-expression to apply these
same four components to hearing what others are observing, feeling,
needing, and requesting. We refer to this part of the communication
process as receiving empathically.</p>
<p>The two parts of NVC:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>expressing honestly</p></li>
<li><p>receiving empathically</p></li>
</ol>
<h5 id="presence-dont-just-do-something-stand-there">Presence: Don’t
Just Do Something, Stand There</h5>
<p>Empathy is a respectful understanding of what others are
experiencing. The Chinese philosopher Chuang-Tzu stated that true
empathy requires listening with the whole being: “The hearing that is
only in the ears is one thing. The hearing of the understanding is
another. But the hearing of the spirit is not limited to any one
faculty, to the ear, or to the mind. Hence it demands the emptiness of
all the faculties. And when the faculties are empty, then the whole
being listens. There is then a direct grasp of what is right there
before you that can never be heard with the ear or understood with the
mind.”</p>
<p>Empathy: emptying our mind and listening with our whole being</p>
<p>Empathy with others occurs only when we have successfully shed all
preconceived ideas and judgments about them. The Austrian-born Israeli
philosopher Martin Buber describes this quality of presence that life
demands of us: “In spite of all similarities, every living situation
has, like a newborn child, a new face, that has never been before and
will never come again. It demands of you a reaction that cannot be
prepared beforehand. It demands nothing of what is past. It demands
presence, responsibility; it demands you.”</p>
<p>The presence that empathy requires is not easy to maintain. “The
capacity to give one’s attention to a sufferer is a very rare and
difficult thing; it is almost a miracle; it is a miracle,” asserts
French philosopher Simone Weil. “Nearly all those who think they have
the capacity do not possess it.” Instead of offering empathy, we tend
instead to give advice or reassurance and to explain our own position or
feeling. Empathy, on the other hand, requires us to focus full attention
on the other person’s message. We give to others the time and space they
need to express themselves fully and to feel understood. There is a
Buddhist saying that aptly describes this ability: “Don’t just do
something, stand there.”</p>
<p>Ask before offering advice or reassurance.</p>
<p>It is often frustrating for someone needing empathy to have us assume
that they want reassurance or “fix-it” advice. I received a lesson from
my daughter that taught me to check whether advice or reassurance is
wanted before offering any. She was looking in the mirror one day and
said, “I’m as ugly as a pig.”</p>
<p>“You’re the most gorgeous creature God ever put on the face of the
earth,” I declared. She shot me a look of exasperation, exclaimed, “Oh,
Daddy!” and slammed the door as she left the room. I later found out
that she had wanted some empathy. Instead of my ill-timed reassurance, I
could have asked, “Are you feeling disappointed with your appearance
today?”</p>
<p>My friend Holley Humphrey identified some common behaviors that
prevent us from being sufficiently present to connect empathically with
others. The following are examples:</p>
<p>Advising: “I think you should …” “How come you didn’t … ?”</p>
<p>One-upping: “That’s nothing; wait’ll you hear what happened to
me.”</p>
<p>Educating: “This could turn into a very positive experience for you
if you just …”</p>
<p>Consoling: “It wasn’t your fault; you did the best you could.”</p>
<p>Story-telling: “That reminds me of the time …”</p>
<p>Shutting down: “Cheer up. Don’t feel so bad.”</p>
<p>Sympathizing: “Oh, you poor thing …”</p>
<p>Interrogating: “When did this begin?”</p>
<p>Explaining: “I would have called but …”</p>
<p>Correcting: “That’s not how it happened.”</p>
<p>In his book When Bad Things Happen to Good People, Rabbi Harold
Kushner describes how painful it was for him, when his son was dying, to
hear the words people offered that were intended to make him feel
better. Even more painful was his recognition that for twenty years he
had been saying the same things to other people in similar
situations!</p>
<p>Believing we have to “fix” situations and make others feel better
prevents us from being present. Those of us in the role of counselor or
psychotherapist are particularly susceptible to this belief. Once, when
I was working with twenty-three mental health professionals, I asked
them to write, word for word, how they would respond to a client who
says, “I’m feeling very depressed. I just don’t see any reason to go
on.” I collected the answers they had written down and announced, “I am
now going to read out loud what each of you wrote. Imagine yourself in
the role of the person who expressed the feeling of depression, and
raise your hand after each statement you hear that gives you a sense
that you’ve been understood.” Hands were raised to only three of the
twenty-three responses. Questions such as, “When did this begin?”
constituted the most frequent response; they give the appearance that
the professional is obtaining the information necessary to diagnose and
then treat the problem. In fact, such intellectual understanding of a
problem blocks the kind of presence that empathy requires. When we are
thinking about people’s words and listening to how they connect to our
theories, we are looking at people—we are not with them. The key
ingredient of empathy is presence: we are wholly present with the other
party and what they are experiencing. This quality of presence
distinguishes empathy from either mental understanding or sympathy.
While we may choose at times to sympathize with others by feeling their
feelings, it’s helpful to be aware that during the moment we are
offering sympathy, we are not empathizing.</p>
<p>Intellectual understanding blocks empathy.</p>
<h5 id="listening-for-feelings-and-needs">Listening for Feelings and
Needs</h5>
<p>In NVC, no matter what words people use to express themselves, we
listen for their observations, feelings, needs, and requests. Imagine
you’ve loaned your car to a new neighbor who had a personal emergency,
and when your family finds out, they react with intensity: “You are a
fool for having trusted a total stranger!” You can use the components of
NVC to tune in to the feelings and needs of those family members in
contrast to either (1) blaming yourself by taking the message
personally, or (2) blaming and judging them.</p>
<p>No matter what others say, we only hear what they are (1) observing,
(2) feeling, (3) needing, and (4) requesting.</p>
<p>In this situation, it’s obvious what the family is observing and
reacting to: the lending of the car to a relative stranger. In other
situations, it may not be so clear. If a colleague tells us, “You’re not
a good team player,” we may not know what he or she is observing,
although we can usually guess at the behavior that might have triggered
such a statement.</p>
<p>The following exchange, from a workshop, demonstrates the difficulty
of focusing on other people’s feelings and needs when we are accustomed
to assuming responsibility for their feelings and taking messages
personally. The woman in this dialogue wanted to learn to hear the
feelings and needs behind certain of her husband’s statements. I
suggested that she guess at his feelings and needs and then check it out
with him.</p>
<p>Husband’s statement: What good does talking to you do? You never
listen.</p>
<p>Woman: Are you feeling unhappy with me?</p>
<p>MBR: When you say “with me,” you imply that his feelings are the
result of what you did. I would prefer for you to say, “Are you unhappy
because you were needing … ?” and not “Are you unhappy with me?” It
would put your attention on what’s going on within him and decrease the
likelihood of your taking the message personally.</p>
<p>Woman: But what would I say? “Are you unhappy because you … ? Because
you what?”</p>
<p>MBR: Get your clue from the content of your husband’s message, “What
good does talking to you do? You never listen.” What is he needing that
he’s not getting when he says that?</p>
<p>Woman: (trying to empathize with the needs expressed through her
husband’s message) Are you feeling unhappy because you feel like I don’t
understand you?</p>
<p>MBR: Notice that you are focusing on what he’s thinking, and not on
what he’s needing. I think you’ll find people to be less threatening if
you hear what they’re needing rather than what they’re thinking about
you. Instead of hearing that he’s unhappy because he thinks you don’t
listen, focus on what he’s needing by saying, “Are you unhappy because
you are needing …”</p>
<p>Woman: (trying again) Are you feeling unhappy because you are needing
to be heard?</p>
<p>MBR: That’s what I had in mind. Does it make a difference for you to
hear him this way?</p>
<p>Woman: Definitely—a big difference. I see what’s going on for him
without hearing that I had done anything wrong.</p>
<p>Listen to what people are needing rather than what they are
thinking.</p>
<h5 id="paraphrasing">Paraphrasing</h5>
<p>After we focus our attention and hear what others are observing,
feeling, and needing and what they are requesting to enrich their lives,
we may wish to reflect back by paraphrasing what we have understood. In
our previous discussion on requests (Chapter 6), we discussed how to ask
for a reflection; now we will look at how to offer it to others.</p>
<p>If we have accurately received the other party’s message, our
paraphrasing will confirm this for them. If, on the other hand, our
paraphrase is incorrect, we give the speaker an opportunity to correct
us. Another advantage of choosing to reflect a message back to the other
party is that it offers them time to reflect on what they’ve said and an
opportunity to delve deeper into themselves.</p>
<p>NVC suggests that our paraphrasing take the form of questions that
reveal our understanding while eliciting any necessary corrections from
the speaker. Questions may focus on these components:</p>
<p>what others are observing: “Are you reacting to how many evenings I
was gone last week?”</p>
<p>how others are feeling and the needs generating their feelings: “Are
you feeling hurt because you would have liked more appreciation of your
efforts than you received?”</p>
<p>what others are requesting: “Are you wanting me to tell you my
reasons for saying what I did?”</p>
<p>These questions require us to sense what’s going on within other
people, while inviting their corrections should we have sensed
incorrectly. Notice the difference between these questions and the ones
below:</p>
<p>“What did I do that you are referring to?”</p>
<p>“How are you feeling?” “Why are you feeling that way?”</p>
<p>“What are you wanting me to do about it?”</p>
<p>This second set of questions asks for information without first
sensing the speaker’s reality. Though they may appear to be the most
direct way to connect with what’s going on within the other person, I’ve
found that questions like these are not the safest route to obtain the
information we seek. Many such questions may give speakers the
impression that we’re a schoolteacher examining them or a
psychotherapist working on a case. If we do decide to ask for
information in this way, however, I’ve found that people feel safer if
we first reveal the feelings and needs within ourselves that are
generating the question. Thus, instead of asking someone, “What did I
do?” we might say, “I’m frustrated because I’d like to be clearer about
what you are referring to. Would you be willing to tell me what I’ve
done that leads you to see me in this way?” While this step may not be
necessary—or even helpful—in situations where our feelings and needs are
clearly conveyed by the context or tone of voice, I would recommend it
particularly during moments when the questions we ask are accompanied by
strong emotions.</p>
<p>When asking for information, first express our own feelings and
needs.</p>
<p>How do we determine if an occasion calls for us to reflect people’s
messages back to them? Certainly if we are unsure that we have
accurately understood the message, we might use paraphrasing to elicit a
correction to our guess. But even if we are confident that we’ve
understood them, we may sense the other party wanting confirmation that
their message has been accurately received. They may even express this
desire overtly by asking, “Is that clear?” or “Do you understand what I
mean?” At such moments, hearing a clear paraphrase will often be more
reassuring to the speaker than hearing simply, “Yes, I understand.”</p>
<p>For example, shortly after participating in an NVC training, a
volunteer at a hospital was requested by some nurses to talk to an
elderly patient: “We’ve told this woman she isn’t that sick and that
she’d get better if she took her medicine, but all she does is sit in
her room all day long repeating, ‘I want to die. I want to die.’” The
volunteer approached the elderly woman, and as the nurses had predicted,
found her sitting alone, whispering over and over, “I want to die.”</p>
<p>“So you would like to die,” the volunteer empathized. Surprised, the
woman broke off her chant and appeared relieved. She began to talk about
how no one understood how terrible she was feeling. The volunteer
continued to reflect back the woman’s feelings; before long, such warmth
had entered their dialogue that they were sitting with their arms locked
around each other. Later that day, the nurses questioned the volunteer
about her magic formula: the elderly woman had started to eat and take
her medicine, and was apparently in better spirits. Although the nurses
had tried to help her with advice and reassurance, it wasn’t until her
interaction with the volunteer that this woman received what she was
truly needing: connection with another human being who could hear her
profound despair.</p>
<p>There are no infallible guidelines regarding when to paraphrase, but
as a rule of thumb, it is safe to assume that speakers expressing
intensely emotional messages would appreciate our reflecting these back
to them. When we ourselves are talking, we can make it easier for the
listener if we clearly signify when we want or don’t want our words to
be reflected back to us.</p>
<p>Reflect back messages that are emotionally charged.</p>
<p>There are occasions when we may choose not to verbally reflect
someone’s statements out of respect for certain cultural norms. For
example, a Chinese man once attended a workshop to learn how to hear the
feelings and needs behind his father’s remarks. Because he could not
bear the criticism and attack he continually heard in his father’s
words, this man dreaded visiting his father and avoided him for months
at a time. He came to me ten years later and reported that his ability
to hear feelings and needs had radically transformed his relationship
with his father to the point where they now enjoy a close and loving
connection. Although he listens for his father’s feelings and needs,
however, he does not paraphrase what he hears. “I never say it out
loud,” he explained. “In our culture, to direct-talk to a person about
their feelings is something they’re not used to. But thanks to the fact
that I no longer hear what he says as an attack, but as his own feelings
and needs, our relationship has become enormously wonderful.”</p>
<p>Paraphrase only when it contributes to greater compassion and
understanding.</p>
<p>“So you’re never going to talk directly to him about feelings, but it
helps to be able to hear them?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No, now I think I’m probably ready,” he answered. “Now that we have
such a solid relationship, if I were to say to him, ‘Dad, I’d like to be
able to talk directly to you about what we are feeling,’ I think he just
might be ready to do it.”</p>
<p>When we paraphrase, the tone of voice we use is highly important.
When hearing themselves reflected back, people are likely to be
sensitive to the slightest hint of criticism or sarcasm. They are
likewise negatively affected by a declarative tone that implies that we
are telling them what is going on inside of them. If we are consciously
listening for other people’s feelings and needs, however, our tone
communicates that we’re asking whether we have understood—not claiming
that we have understood.</p>
<p>We also need to be prepared for the possibility that the intention
behind our paraphrasing will be misinterpreted. “Don’t pull any of that
psychology crap on me!” we may be told. Should this occur, we continue
our effort to sense the speaker’s feelings and needs; perhaps we see in
this case that the speaker doesn’t trust our motives and needs more
understanding of our intentions before he can appreciate hearing our
paraphrases. As we’ve seen, all criticism, attack, insults, and
judgments vanish when we focus attention on hearing the feelings and
needs behind a message. The more we practice in this way, the more we
realize a simple truth: behind all those messages we’ve allowed
ourselves to be intimidated by are just individuals with unmet needs
appealing to us to contribute to their well-being. When we receive
messages with this awareness, we never feel dehumanized by what others
have to say to us. We only feel dehumanized when we get trapped in
derogatory images of other people or thoughts of wrongness about
ourselves. As author and mythologist Joseph Campbell suggested, “‘What
will they think of me?’ must be put aside for bliss.” We begin to feel
this bliss when messages previously experienced as critical or blaming
begin to be seen for the gifts they are: opportunities to give to people
who are in pain.</p>
<p>Behind intimidating messages are merely people appealing to us to
meet their needs.</p>
<p>A difficult message becomes an opportunity to enrich someone’s
life.</p>
<p>If it happens regularly that people distrust our motives and
sincerity when we paraphrase their words, we may need to examine our own
intentions more closely. Perhaps we are paraphrasing and engaging the
components of NVC in a mechanistic way without maintaining clear
consciousness of purpose. We might ask ourselves, for example, whether
we are more intent on applying the process “correctly” than on
connecting with the human being in front of us. Or perhaps, even though
we are using the form of NVC, our only interest is in changing the other
person’s behavior.</p>
<p>Some people resist paraphrasing as a waste of time. One city
administrator explained during a practice session, “I’m paid to give
facts and solutions, not to sit around doing psychotherapy with everyone
who comes into my office.” This same administrator, however, was being
confronted by angry citizens who would come to him with their passionate
concerns and leave dissatisfied for not having been heard. Some of these
citizens later confided to me, “When you go to his office, he gives you
a bunch of facts, but you never know whether he’s heard you first. When
that happens, you start to distrust his facts.” Paraphrasing tends to
save, rather than waste, time. Studies in labor-management negotiations
demonstrate that the time required to reach conflict resolution is cut
in half when each negotiator agrees, before responding, to accurately
repeat what the previous speaker had said.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing saves time.</p>
<p>I recall a man who was initially skeptical about the value of
paraphrasing. He and his wife were attending an NVC workshop during a
time when their marriage was beset by serious problems. During the
workshop, his wife said to him, “You never listen to me.”</p>
<p>“I do too,” he replied.</p>
<p>“No, you don’t,” she countered.</p>
<p>I addressed the husband: “I’m afraid you just proved her point. You
didn’t respond in a way that lets her know that you were listening to
her.”</p>
<p>He was puzzled by the point I was making, so I asked for permission
to play his role—which he gladly gave since he wasn’t having too much
success with it. His wife and I then had the following exchange:</p>
<p>Wife: “You never listen to me.”</p>
<p>MBR in role of husband: “It sounds like you’re terribly frustrated
because you would like to feel more connection when we speak.”</p>
<p>The wife was moved to tears when she finally received this
confirmation that she had been understood. I turned to the husband and
explained, “I believe this is what she is telling you she needs—a
reflection of her feelings and needs as a confirmation that she’d been
heard.” The husband seemed dumbfounded. “Is that all she wanted?” he
asked, incredulous that such a simple act could have had such a strong
impact on his wife.</p>
<p>A short time later, he enjoyed the satisfaction firsthand when his
wife reflected back to him a statement that he had made with great
emotional intensity. Savoring her paraphrase, he looked at me and
declared, “It’s valid.” It is a poignant experience to receive concrete
evidence that someone is empathically connected to us.</p>
<h5 id="sustaining-empathy">Sustaining Empathy</h5>
<p>I recommend allowing others the opportunity to fully express
themselves before turning our attention to solutions or requests for
relief. When we proceed too quickly to what people might be requesting,
we may not convey our genuine interest in their feelings and needs;
instead, they may get the impression that we’re in a hurry to either be
free of them or to fix their problem. Furthermore, an initial message is
often like the tip of an iceberg; it may be followed by as yet
unexpressed, but related—and often more powerful—feelings. By
maintaining our attention on what’s going on within others, we offer
them a chance to fully explore and express their interior selves. We
would stem this flow if we were to shift attention too quickly either to
their request or to our own desire to express ourselves.</p>
<p>Suppose a mother comes to us, saying, “My child is impossible. No
matter what I tell him to do, he doesn’t listen.” We might reflect her
feelings and needs by saying, “It sounds like you’re feeling desperate
and would like to find some way of connecting with your son.” Such a
paraphrase often encourages a person to look within. If we have
accurately reflected her statement, the mother might touch upon other
feelings: “Maybe it’s my fault. I’m always yelling at him.” As the
listener, we would continue to stay with the feelings and needs being
expressed and say, for example, “Are you feeling guilty because you
would have liked to have been more understanding of him than you have
been at times?” If the mother continues to sense understanding in our
reflection, she might move further into her feelings and declare, “I’m
just a failure as a mother.” We continue to remain with the feelings and
needs being expressed: “So you’re feeling discouraged and want to relate
differently to him?” We persist in this manner until the person has
exhausted all her feelings surrounding this issue.</p>
<p>When we stay with empathy, we allow speakers to touch deeper levels
of themselves.</p>
<p>What evidence is there that we’ve adequately empathized with the
other person? First, when an individual realizes that everything going
on within has received full empathic understanding, they will experience
a sense of relief. We can become aware of this phenomenon by noticing a
corresponding release of tension in our own body. A second, even more
obvious sign is that the person will stop talking. If we are uncertain
as to whether we have stayed long enough in the process, we can always
ask, “Is there more that you wanted to say?”</p>
<p>We know a speaker has received adequate empathy when (1) we sense a
release of tension, or (2) the flow of words comes to a halt.</p>
<h5 id="when-pain-blocks-our-ability-to-empathize">When Pain Blocks Our
Ability to Empathize</h5>
<p>It is impossible for us to give something to another if we don’t have
it ourselves. Likewise, if we find ourselves unable or unwilling to
empathize despite our efforts, it is usually a sign that we are too
starved for empathy to be able to offer it to others. Sometimes, if we
openly acknowledge that our own distress is preventing us from
responding empathically, the other person may come through with the
empathy we need.</p>
<p>We need empathy to give empathy.</p>
<p>At other times, it may be necessary to provide ourselves with some
“emergency first aid” empathy by listening to what’s going on in
ourselves with the same quality of presence and attention that we offer
to others. Former United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold once
said, “The more faithfully you listen to the voice within you, the
better you will hear what is happening outside.” If we become skilled at
giving ourselves empathy, we often experience in just a few seconds a
natural release of energy that then enables us to be present with the
other person. If this fails to happen, however, we have a couple of
other choices.</p>
<p>We can scream—nonviolently. I recall spending three days mediating
between two gangs that had been killing each other off. One gang called
themselves Black Egyptians; the other, the East St. Louis Police
Department. The score was two to one—a total of three dead within a
month. After three tense days trying to bring these groups together to
hear each other and resolve their differences, I was driving home and
thinking how I never wanted to be in the middle of a conflict again for
the rest of my life.</p>
<p>The first thing I saw when I walked through the back door was my
children entangled in a fight. I had no energy to empathize with them so
I screamed nonviolently: “Hey, I’m in a lot of pain! Right now I really
do not want to deal with your fighting! I just want some peace and
quiet!” My older son, then nine, stopped short, looked at me, and asked,
“Do you want to talk about it?”</p>
<p>If we are able to speak our pain nakedly without blame, I find that
even people in distress are sometimes able to hear our need. Of course I
wouldn’t want to scream, “What’s the matter with you? Don’t you know how
to behave any better? I just got home after a rough day!” or insinuate
in any way that their behavior was at fault. I scream nonviolently by
calling attention to my own desperate needs and pain in the moment.</p>
<p>If, however, the other party is also experiencing such intensity of
feelings that they can neither hear us nor leave us alone, and neither
emergency empathy nor nonviolent screaming has served us well, our third
recourse is to physically remove ourselves from the situation. We give
ourselves time out and the opportunity to acquire the empathy we need to
return in a different frame of mind.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Empathy is a respectful understanding of what others are
experiencing. We often have a strong urge to give advice or reassurance
and to explain our own position or feeling. Empathy, however, calls upon
us to empty our mind and listen to others with our whole being.</p>
<p>In NVC, no matter what words others may use to express themselves, we
simply listen for their observations, feelings, needs, and requests.
Then we may wish to reflect back, paraphrasing what we have understood.
We stay with empathy and allow others the opportunity to fully express
themselves before we turn our attention to solutions or requests for
relief.</p>
<p>We need empathy to give empathy. When we sense ourselves being
defensive or unable to empathize, we need to (1) stop, breathe, give
ourselves empathy; (2) scream nonviolently; or (3) take time out.</p>
<p>NVC in Action</p>
<p>A Wife Connects With Her Dying Husband</p>
<p>A patient had just been diagnosed with an advanced stage of lung
cancer. The following scene at his home, involving the patient, his
wife, and a visiting nurse, represents a last opportunity for him to
connect emotionally with his wife and discuss his dying before being
admitted to the hospital. The wife began the conversation with the nurse
by complaining about the physical therapist who was part of the home
health care team assigned to her husband’s care.</p>
<p>Wife: She’s a bad therapist.</p>
<p>Nurse: (listening empathically to what the wife is feeling and
wanting) Are you feeling annoyed and wanting to see a different quality
of care?</p>
<p>Wife: She doesn’t do anything. She made him stop walking when his
pulse got high.</p>
<p>Nurse: (continuing to hear the wife’s feelings and wants) Is it
because you want your husband to get better that you’re scared if the
physical therapist doesn’t push him, he won’t get stronger?</p>
<p>Wife: (starting to cry) Yes, I’m so scared!</p>
<p>Nurse: Are you scared of losing him?</p>
<p>Wife: Yes, we’ve been together so long.</p>
<p>Nurse: (listening for other feelings behind the fear) Are you
worrying about how you would feel if he dies?</p>
<p>Wife: I just can’t imagine how I am going to live without him. He’s
always been there for me. Always.</p>
<p>Nurse: So you’re sad when you think of living without him?</p>
<p>Wife: There is no one else besides him. He’s all I have, you know. My
daughter won’t even talk to me.</p>
<p>Nurse: It sounds like when you think of your daughter, you feel
frustrated because you wish you had a different relationship with
her.</p>
<p>Wife: I wish I did, but she is such a selfish person. I don’t know
why I even bothered having kids. A lot of good it does me now!</p>
<p>Nurse: Sounds to me like you might be somewhat angry and disappointed
because you want more support from the family during your husband’s
illness.</p>
<p>Wife: Yes, he’s so sick; I don’t know how I am going to get through
this alone. I haven’t anyone … not even to talk to, except with you here
… now. Even he won’t talk about it…. Look at him! (Husband remains
silent and impassive.) He doesn’t say anything!</p>
<p>Nurse: Are you sad, wishing the two of you could support each other
and feel more connected?</p>
<p>Wife: Yes. (She pauses, then makes a request.) Talk to him the way
you talk to me.</p>
<p>Nurse: (wishing to clearly understand the need that is being
addressed behind the wife’s request) Are you wanting him to be listened
to in a way that helps him express what he’s feeling inside?</p>
<p>Wife: Yes, yes, that’s exactly it! I want him to feel comfortable
talking and I want to know what he is feeling.</p>
<p>Using the nurse’s guess, the wife was able to first become aware of
what she wanted and then find the words to articulate it. This was a key
moment: often it is difficult for people to identify what they want in a
situation, even though they may know what they don’t want. We see how a
clear request—“Talk to him the way you talk to me”—is a gift that
empowers the other person. The nurse was then able to act in a way she
knew to be in harmony with the wife’s wishes. This altered the
atmosphere in the room, as the nurse and the wife could now “work
together,” both in a compassionate mode.</p>
<p>Nurse: (turning to the husband) How do you feel when you hear what
your wife has shared?</p>
<p>Husband: I really love her.</p>
<p>Nurse: Are you glad to have an opportunity to talk about this with
her?</p>
<p>Husband: Yes, we need to talk about it.</p>
<p>Nurse: Would you be willing to say how you are feeling about the
cancer?</p>
<p>Husband: (after a brief silence) Not very good.</p>
<p>The words good and bad are often used to describe feelings when
people have yet to identify the specific emotion they are experiencing.
Expressing his feelings more precisely would help this patient with the
emotional connection he was seeking with his wife.</p>
<p>Nurse: (encouraging him to move toward more precision) Are you scared
about dying?</p>
<p>Husband: No, not scared. (Notice the nurse’s incorrect guess does not
hamper the continued flow of dialogue.)</p>
<p>Nurse: (Because this patient isn’t able to verbalize his internal
experience easily, the nurse continues to support him in the process.)
Do you feel angry about dying?</p>
<p>Husband: No, not angry.</p>
<p>Nurse: (At this point, after two incorrect guesses, the nurse decides
to express her own feelings.) Well, now I’m puzzled about what you may
be feeling, and wonder if you can tell me.</p>
<p>Husband: I reckon, I’m thinking how she’ll do without me.</p>
<p>Nurse: Oh, are you worried she may not be able to handle her life
without you?</p>
<p>Husband: Yes, worried she’ll miss me.</p>
<p>Nurse: (She is aware that dying patients often hang on due to worry
over those they are leaving behind, and sometimes need reassurance that
loved ones can accept their death before they can let themselves go.) Do
you want to hear how your wife feels when you say that?</p>
<p>Husband: Yes.</p>
<p>Here the wife joined the conversation; in the continued presence of
the nurse, the couple began to express themselves openly to each
other.</p>
<p>In this dialogue, the wife began with a complaint about the physical
therapist. However, after a series of exchanges during which she felt
empathically received, she was able to determine that what she really
sought was a deeper connection with her husband during this critical
stage of their lives.</p>
<p>Exercise 5</p>
<p>RECEIVING EMPATHICALLY VERSUS NON-EMPATHICALLY</p>
<p>To see whether we are in agreement about the verbal expression of
empathy, please circle the number in front of each statement in which
person B is responding empathically to what is going on within Person
A.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Person A: How could I do something so stupid?</li>
</ol>
<p>Person B: Nobody is perfect; you’re too hard on yourself.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Person A: If you ask me, we ought to ship all these immigrants back
to where they came from.</li>
</ol>
<p>Person B: Do you really think that would solve anything?</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Person A: You aren’t God!</li>
</ol>
<p>Person B: Are you feeling frustrated because you would like me to
admit that there can be other ways of interpreting this matter?</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Person A: I think that you take me for granted. I wonder how you
would manage without me.</li>
</ol>
<p>Person B: That’s not true! I don’t take you for granted.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Person A: How could you say a thing like that to me?</li>
</ol>
<p>Person B: Are you feeling hurt because I said that?</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Person A: I’m furious with my husband. He’s never around when I need
him.</li>
</ol>
<p>Person B: You think he should be around more than he is?</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Person A: I’m disgusted with how heavy I’m getting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Person B: Perhaps jogging would help.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Person A: I’ve been a nervous wreck planning for my daughter’s
wedding. Her fiancé’s family is not helping. About every day they change
their minds about the kind of wedding they would like.</li>
</ol>
<p>Person B: So you’re feeling nervous about how to make arrangements
and would appreciate it if your future in-laws could be more aware of
the complications their indecision creates for you?</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Person A: When my relatives come without letting me know ahead of
time, I feel invaded. It reminds me of how my parents used to disregard
my needs and would plan things for me.</li>
</ol>
<p>Person B: I know how you feel. I used to feel that way too.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>Person A: I’m disappointed with your performance. I would have liked
your department to double your production last month.</li>
</ol>
<p>Person B: I understand that you are disappointed, but we have had
many absences due to illness.</p>
<p>Here are my responses for Exercise 5:</p>
<p>I didn’t circle this one because I see Person B giving reassurance to
Person A rather than empathically receiving what Person A is
expressing.</p>
<p>I see Person B attempting to educate Person A rather than
empathically receiving what Person A is expressing.</p>
<p>If you circled this we are in agreement. I see Person B empathically
receiving what Person A is expressing.</p>
<p>I didn’t circle this one because I see Person B disagreeing and
defending rather than empathically receiving what is going on in Person
A.</p>
<p>I see Person B taking responsibility for Person A’s feelings rather
than empathically receiving what is going on in Person A. An example of
an empathic response might be: “Are you feeling hurt because you would
have liked me to agree to do what you requested?”</p>
<p>If you circled this we are in partial agreement. I see Person B
receiving Person A’s thoughts. However, I believe we connect more deeply
when we receive the feelings and needs being expressed rather than the
thoughts. Therefore, I would have preferred it if Person B had said, “So
you’re feeling furious because you would like him to be around more than
he is?”</p>
<p>I didn’t circle this one because I see Person B giving advice rather
than empathically receiving what is going on in Person A.</p>
<p>If you circled this we are in agreement. I see Person B empathically
receiving what is going on in Person A.</p>
<p>I didn’t circle this one because I see Person B assuming they
understand and talking about their own feelings rather than empathically
receiving what is going on in Person A.</p>
<p>I didn’t circle this one because I see Person B starting by focusing
on Person A’s feelings but then shifting to explaining.</p>
