<h4 id="identifying-and-expressing-feelings">Identifying and Expressing
Feelings</h4>
<p>The first component of NVC is to observe without evaluating; the
second component is to express how we are feeling. Psychoanalyst Rollo
May suggests that “the mature person becomes able to differentiate
feelings into as many nuances, strong and passionate experiences, or
delicate and sensitive ones as in the different passages of music in a
symphony.” For many of us, however, our feelings are, as May would
describe it, “limited like notes in a bugle call.”</p>
<h5 id="the-heavy-cost-of-unexpressed-feelings">The Heavy Cost of
Unexpressed Feelings</h5>
<p>Our repertoire of words for calling people names is often larger than
our vocabulary of words to clearly describe our emotional states. I went
through twenty-one years of American schools and can’t recall anyone in
all that time ever asking me how I felt. Feelings were simply not
considered important. What was valued was “the right way to think”—as
defined by those who held positions of rank and authority. We are
trained to be “other-directed” rather than to be in contact with
ourselves. We learn to be “up in our head,” wondering, “What is it that
others think is right for me to say and do?”</p>
<p>An interaction I had with a teacher when I was about nine years old
demonstrates how alienation from our feelings can begin. I once hid
myself in a classroom after school because some boys were waiting
outside to beat me up. A teacher spotted me and asked me to leave the
school. When I explained I was afraid to go, she declared, “Big boys
don’t get frightened.” A few years later I received further
reinforcement through my participation in athletics. It was typical for
coaches to value athletes willing to “give their all” and continue
playing no matter how much physical pain they were in. I learned the
lesson so well I once continued playing baseball for a month with an
untreated broken wrist.</p>
<p>At an NVC workshop, a college student spoke about being kept awake by
a roommate who played the stereo late at night and loudly. When asked to
express what he felt when this happened, the student replied, “I feel
that it isn’t right to play music so loud at night.” I pointed out that
when he followed the word feel with the word that, he was expressing an
opinion but not revealing his feelings. Asked to try again to express
his feelings, he responded, “I feel, when people do something like that,
it’s a personality disturbance.” I explained that this was still an
opinion rather than a feeling. He paused thoughtfully, and then
announced with vehemence, “I have no feelings about it whatsoever!”</p>
<p>This student obviously had strong feelings. Unfortunately, he didn’t
know how to become aware of his feelings, let alone express them. This
difficulty in identifying and expressing feelings is common, and in my
experience, especially so among lawyers, engineers, police officers,
corporate managers, and career military personnel—people whose
professional codes discourage them from manifesting emotions. For
families, the toll is severe when members are unable to communicate
emotions. Country singer Reba McEntire wrote a song after her father’s
death, and titled it “The Greatest Man I Never Knew.” In so doing, she
undoubtedly expressed the sentiments of many people who were never able
to establish the emotional connection they would have liked with their
fathers.</p>
<p>I regularly hear statements like, “I wouldn’t want you to get the
wrong idea—I’m married to a wonderful man—but I never know what he is
feeling.” One such dissatisfied woman brought her spouse to a workshop,
during which she told him, “I feel like I’m married to a wall.” The
husband then did an excellent imitation of a wall: he sat mute and
immobile. Exasperated, she turned to me and exclaimed, “See! This is
what happens all the time. He sits and says nothing. It’s just like
living with a wall.”</p>
<p>“It sounds to me like you are feeling lonely and wanting more
emotional contact with your husband,” I responded. When she agreed, I
tried to show how statements such as “I feel like I’m living with a
wall” are unlikely to bring her feelings and desires to her husband’s
attention. In fact, they are more likely to be heard as criticism than
as invitations to connect with our feelings. Furthermore, such
statements often lead to self-fulfilling prophecies. A husband, for
example, hears himself criticized for behaving like a wall; he is hurt
and discouraged and doesn’t respond, thereby confirming his wife’s image
of him as a wall.</p>
<p>The benefits of strengthening our feelings vocabulary are evident not
only in intimate relationships but also in the professional world. I was
once hired to consult with members of a technological department of a
large Swiss corporation; they were troubled by the discovery that
workers in other departments were avoiding them. When asked, employees
from other departments responded, “We hate going there to consult with
those people. It’s like talking to a bunch of machines!” The problem
abated when I spent time with the members of the technological
department, encouraging them to express more of their humanness in their
communications with co-workers.</p>
<p>In another instance, I was working with hospital administrators who
were anxious about a forthcoming meeting with the hospital’s physicians.
The administrators were eager to have me demonstrate how they might use
NVC when approaching the physicians for support for a project that had
only recently been turned down by a vote of 17 to 1.</p>
<p>Assuming the voice of an administrator in a role-playing session, I
opened with, “I’m feeling frightened to be bringing up this issue.” I
chose to start this way because I sensed how frightened the
administrators were as they prepared to confront the physicians on this
topic again. Before I could continue, one of the administrators stopped
me to protest, “You’re being unrealistic! We could never tell the
physicians that we were frightened.”</p>
<p>When I asked why an admission of fear seemed so impossible, he
replied without hesitation, “If we admitted we’re frightened, then they
would just pick us to pieces!” His answer didn’t surprise me; I have
often heard people say they cannot imagine ever expressing feelings at
their workplace. I was pleased to learn, however, that one of the
administrators did decide to risk expressing his vulnerability at the
dreaded meeting. Departing from his customary manner of appearing
strictly logical, rational, and unemotional, he chose to state his
feelings together with his reasons for wanting the physicians to change
their position. He noticed how differently the physicians responded to
him. In the end he was amazed and relieved when, instead of “picking him
to pieces,” the physicians reversed their previous position and voted 17
to 1 to support the project instead. This dramatic turn-around helped
the administrators realize and appreciate the potential impact of
expressing vulnerability—even in the workplace.</p>
<p>Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>Finally, let me share a personal incident that taught me the effects
of hiding our feelings. I was teaching a course in NVC to a group of
inner city students. When I walked into the room the first day, the
students, who had been enjoying a lively conversation with each other,
became quiet. “Good morning!” I greeted. Silence. I felt very
uncomfortable, but was afraid to express it. Instead, I proceeded in my
most professional manner: “For this class, we will be studying a process
of communication that I hope you will find helpful in your relationships
at home and with your friends.”</p>
<p>I continued to present information about NVC, but no one seemed to be
listening. One girl, rummaging through her bag, fished out a file and
began vigorously filing her nails. Students near the windows glued their
faces to the panes as if fascinated by what was going on in the street
below. I felt increasingly more uncomfortable, yet continued to say
nothing about it. Finally, a student who had certainly more courage than
I was demonstrating, piped up, “You just hate being with black people,
don’t you?” I was stunned, yet immediately realized how I had
contributed to this student’s perception by trying to hide my
discomfort.</p>
<p>“I am feeling nervous,” I admitted, “but not because you are black.
My feelings have to do with my not knowing anyone here and wanting to be
accepted when I came in the room.” My expression of vulnerability had a
pronounced effect on the students. They started to ask questions about
me, to tell me things about themselves, and to express curiosity about
NVC.</p>
<h5 id="feelings-versus-non-feelings">Feelings versus Non-Feelings</h5>
<p>A common confusion, generated by the English language, is our use of
the word feel without actually expressing a feeling. For example, in the
sentence, “I feel I didn’t get a fair deal,” the words I feel could be
more accurately replaced with I think. In general, feelings are not
being clearly expressed when the word feel is followed by:</p>
<p>Words such as that, like, as if: “I feel that you should know
better.”</p>
<p>“I feel like a failure.”</p>
<p>“I feel as if I’m living with a wall.”</p>
<p>The pronouns I, you, he, she, they, it: “I feel I am constantly on
call.”</p>
<p>“I feel it is useless.”</p>
<p>Names or nouns referring to people: “I feel Amy has been pretty
responsible.”</p>
<p>“I feel my boss is being manipulative.”</p>
<p>Distinguish feelings from thoughts.</p>
<p>Conversely, in the English language, it is not necessary to use the
word feel at all when we are actually expressing a feeling: we can say,
“I’m feeling irritated,” or simply, “I’m irritated.”</p>
<p>Distinguish between what we feel and what we think we are.</p>
<p>In NVC, we distinguish between words that express actual feelings and
those that describe what we think we are.</p>
<p>Description of what we think we are: “I feel inadequate as a guitar
player.”</p>
<p>In this statement, I am assessing my ability as a guitar player,
rather than clearly expressing my feelings.</p>
<p>Expressions of actual feelings: “I feel disappointed in myself as a
guitar player.”</p>
<p>“I feel impatient with myself as a guitar player.”</p>
<p>“I feel frustrated with myself as a guitar player.”</p>
<p>The actual feeling behind my assessment of myself as “inadequate”
could therefore be disappointment, impatience, frustration, or some
other emotion.</p>
<p>Likewise, it is helpful to differentiate between words that describe
what we think others are doing around us, and words that describe actual
feelings. The following are examples of statements that are easily
mistaken as expressions of feelings: in fact they reveal more how we
think others are behaving than what we are actually feeling
ourselves.</p>
<p>Distinguish between what we feel and how we think others react or
behave toward us.</p>
<p>“I feel unimportant to the people with whom I work.” The word
unimportant describes how I think others are evaluating me, rather than
an actual feeling, which in this situation might be “I feel sad” or “I
feel discouraged.”</p>
<p>“I feel misunderstood.” Here the word misunderstood indicates my
assessment of the other person’s level of understanding rather than an
actual feeling. In this situation, I may be feeling anxious or annoyed
or some other emotion.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>“I feel ignored.” Again, this is more of an interpretation of the
actions of others than a clear statement of how we are feeling. No doubt
there have been times we thought we were being ignored and our feeling
was relief, because we wanted to be left to ourselves. No doubt there
were other times, however, when we felt hurt when we thought we were
being ignored, because we had wanted to be involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Words like ignored express how we interpret others, rather than how
we feel. Here is a sampling of such words:</p>
<p>abandoned</p>
<p>abused</p>
<p>attacked</p>
<p>betrayed</p>
<p>boxed-in</p>
<p>bullied</p>
<p>cheated</p>
<p>coerced</p>
<p>co-opted</p>
<p>cornered</p>
<p>diminished</p>
<p>distrusted</p>
<p>interrupted</p>
<p>intimidated</p>
<p>let down</p>
<p>manipulated</p>
<p>misunderstood</p>
<p>neglected</p>
<p>overworked</p>
<p>patronized</p>
<p>pressured</p>
<p>provoked</p>
<p>put down</p>
<p>rejected</p>
<p>taken for granted</p>
<p>threatened</p>
<p>unappreciated</p>
<p>unheard</p>
<p>unseen</p>
<p>unsupported</p>
<p>unwanted</p>
<p>used</p>
<h5 id="building-a-vocabulary-for-feelings">Building a Vocabulary for
Feelings</h5>
<p>In expressing our feelings, it helps to use words that refer to
specific emotions, rather than words that are vague or general. For
example, if we say, “I feel good about that,” the word good could mean
happy, excited, relieved, or a number of other emotions. Words such as
good and bad prevent the listener from connecting easily with what we
might actually be feeling.</p>
<p>The following lists have been compiled to help you increase your
power to articulate feelings and clearly describe a whole range of
emotional states.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The second component necessary for expressing ourselves is feelings.
By developing a vocabulary of feelings that allows us to clearly and
specifically name or identify our emotions, we can connect more easily
with one another. Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our
feelings can help resolve conflicts. NVC distinguishes the expression of
actual feelings from words and statements that describe thoughts,
assessments, and interpretations.</p>
<p>Exercise 2</p>
<p>EXPRESSING FEELINGS</p>
<p>If you would like to see whether we’re in agreement about the verbal
expression of feelings, circle the number in front of each of the
following statements in which feelings are verbally expressed.</p>
<p>“I feel you don’t love me.”</p>
<p>“I’m sad that you’re leaving.”</p>
<p>“I feel scared when you say that.”</p>
<p>“When you don’t greet me, I feel neglected.”</p>
<p>“I’m happy that you can come.”</p>
<p>“You’re disgusting.”</p>
<p>“I feel like hitting you.”</p>
<p>“I feel misunderstood.”</p>
<p>“I feel good about what you did for me.”</p>
<p>“I’m worthless.”</p>
<p>Here are my responses for Exercise 2:</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. I don’t consider
“you don’t love me” to be a feeling. To me, it expresses what the
speaker thinks the other person is feeling, rather than how the speaker
is feeling. Whenever the words I feel are followed by the words I, you,
he, she, they, it, that, like, or as if, what follows is generally not
what I would consider to be a feeling. An expression of feeling in this
case might be: “I’m sad,” or “I’m feeling anguished.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that a feeling was
verbally expressed.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that a feeling was
verbally expressed.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. I don’t consider
“neglected” to be a feeling. To me, it expresses what the speaker thinks
the other person is doing to him or her. An expression of feeling might
be: “When you don’t greet me at the door, I feel lonely.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that a feeling was
verbally expressed.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. I don’t consider
“disgusting” to be a feeling. To me, it expresses how the speaker thinks
about the other person, rather than how the speaker is feeling. An
expression of feeling might be: “I feel disgusted.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. I don’t consider
“like hitting you” to be a feeling. To me, it expresses what the speaker
imagines doing, rather than how the speaker is feeling. An expression of
feeling might be: “I am furious at you.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. I don’t consider
“misunderstood” to be a feeling. To me, it expresses what the speaker
thinks the other person is doing. An expression of feeling in this case
might be: “I feel frustrated,” or “I feel discouraged.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that a feeling was
verbally expressed. However, the word good is vague when used to convey
a feeling. We can usually express our feelings more clearly by using
other words, for example: relieved, gratified, or encouraged.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. I don’t consider
“worthless” to be a feeling. To me, it expresses how the speaker thinks
about himself or herself, rather than how the speaker is feeling. An
expression of feeling in this case might be: “I feel skeptical about my
own talents,” or “I feel wretched.”</p>
