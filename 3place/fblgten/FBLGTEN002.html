<h4 id="giving-from-the-heart">Giving From the Heart</h4>
<p>The Heart of Nonviolent Communication</p>
<p>What I want in my life is compassion,</p>
<p>a flow between myself and others based</p>
<p>on a mutual giving from the heart.</p>
<p>—Marshall B. Rosenberg, PhD</p>
<h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>
<p>Believing that it is our nature to enjoy giving and receiving in a
compassionate manner, I have been preoccupied most of my life with two
questions: What happens to disconnect us from our compassionate nature,
leading us to behave violently and exploitatively? And conversely, what
allows some people to stay connected to their compassionate nature under
even the most trying circumstances?</p>
<p>My preoccupation with these questions began in childhood, around the
summer of 1943, when our family moved to Detroit, Michigan. The second
week after we arrived, a race war erupted over an incident at a public
park. More than forty people were killed in the next few days. Our
neighborhood was situated in the center of the violence, and we spent
three days locked in the house.</p>
<p>When the race riot ended and school began, I discovered that a name
could be as dangerous as any skin color. When the teacher called my name
during attendance, two boys glared at me and hissed, “Are you a kike?” I
had never heard the word before and didn’t know some people used it in a
derogatory way to refer to Jews. After school, the same two boys were
waiting for me: they threw me to the ground and kicked and beat me.</p>
<p>Since that summer in 1943, I have been examining the two questions I
mentioned. What empowers us, for example, to stay connected to our
compassionate nature even under the worst circumstances? I am thinking
of people like Etty Hillesum, who remained compassionate even while
subjected to the grotesque conditions of a German concentration camp. As
she wrote in her journal at the time,</p>
<p>I am not easily frightened. Not because I am brave but because I know
that I am dealing with human beings, and that I must try as hard as I
can to understand everything that anyone ever does. And that was the
real import of this morning: not that a disgruntled young Gestapo
officer yelled at me, but that I felt no indignation, rather a real
compassion, and would have liked to ask, ‘Did you have a very unhappy
childhood, has your girlfriend let you down?’ Yes, he looked harassed
and driven, sullen and weak. I should have liked to start treating him
there and then, for I know that pitiful young men like that are
dangerous as soon as they are let loose on mankind.</p>
<p>—Etty Hillesum in Etty: A Diary 1941–1943</p>
<p>While studying the factors that affect our ability to stay
compassionate, I was struck by the crucial role of language and our use
of words. I have since identified a specific approach to
communicating—both speaking and listening—that leads us to give from the
heart, connecting us with ourselves and with each other in a way that
allows our natural compassion to flourish. I call this approach
Nonviolent Communication, using the term nonviolence as Gandhi used
it—to refer to our natural state of compassion when violence has
subsided from the heart. While we may not consider the way we talk to be
“violent,” words often lead to hurt and pain, whether for others or
ourselves. In some communities, the process I am describing is known as
Compassionate Communication; the abbreviation NVC is used throughout
this book to refer to Nonviolent or Compassionate Communication.</p>
<p>NVC: a way of communicating that leads us to give from the heart.</p>
<h5 id="a-way-to-focus-attention">A Way to Focus Attention</h5>
<p>NVC is founded on language and communication skills that strengthen
our ability to remain human, even under trying conditions. It contains
nothing new; all that has been integrated into NVC has been known for
centuries. The intent is to remind us about what we already know—about
how we humans were meant to relate to one another—and to assist us in
living in a way that concretely manifests this knowledge.</p>
<p>NVC guides us in reframing how we express ourselves and hear others.
Instead of habitual, automatic reactions, our words become conscious
responses based firmly on awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling,
and wanting. We are led to express ourselves with honesty and clarity,
while simultaneously paying others a respectful and empathic attention.
In any exchange, we come to hear our own deeper needs and those of
others. NVC trains us to observe carefully, and to be able to specify
behaviors and conditions that are affecting us. We learn to identify and
clearly articulate what we are concretely wanting in any given
situation. The form is simple, yet powerfully transformative.</p>
<p>As NVC replaces our old patterns of defending, withdrawing, or
attacking in the face of judgment and criticism, we come to perceive
ourselves and others, as well as our intentions and relationships, in a
new light. Resistance, defensiveness, and violent reactions are
minimized. When we focus on clarifying what is being observed, felt, and
needed rather than on diagnosing and judging, we discover the depth of
our own compassion. Through its emphasis on deep listening—to ourselves
as well as to others—NVC fosters respect, attentiveness, and empathy and
engenders a mutual desire to give from the heart.</p>
<p>We perceive relationships in a new light when we use NVC to hear our
own deeper needs and those of others.</p>
<p>Although I refer to it as “a process of communication” or “a language
of compassion,” NVC is more than a process or a language. On a deeper
level, it is an ongoing reminder to keep our attention focused on a
place where we are more likely to get what we are seeking.</p>
<p>There is a story of a man on all fours under a street lamp, searching
for something. A policeman passing by asked what he was doing. “Looking
for my car keys,” replied the man, who appeared slightly drunk. “Did you
drop them here?” inquired the officer. “No,” answered the man, “I
dropped them in the alley.” Seeing the policeman’s baffled expression,
the man hastened to explain, “But the light is much better here.”</p>
<p>I find that my cultural conditioning leads me to focus attention on
places where I am unlikely to get what I want. I developed NVC as a way
to train my attention—to shine the light of consciousness—on places that
have the potential to yield what I am seeking. What I want in my life is
compassion, a flow between myself and others based on a mutual giving
from the heart.</p>
<p>Let’s shine the light of consciousness on places where we can hope to
find what we are seeking.</p>
<p>This quality of compassion, which I refer to as “giving from the
heart,” is expressed in the following lyrics by my friend Ruth
Bebermeyer:</p>
<p>I never feel more given to</p>
<p>than when you take from me—</p>
<p>when you understand the joy I feel giving to you.</p>
<p>And you know my giving isn’t done to put you in my debt,</p>
<p>but because I want to live the love I feel for you.</p>
<p>To receive with grace</p>
<p>may be the greatest giving.</p>
<p>There’s no way I can separate the two.</p>
<p>When you give to me,</p>
<p>I give you my receiving.</p>
<p>When you take from me, I feel so given to.</p>
<p>—“Given To” (1978) by Ruth Bebermeyer from the album Given To</p>
<p>When we give from the heart, we do so out of the joy that springs
forth whenever we willingly enrich another person’s life. This kind of
giving benefits both the giver and the receiver. The receiver enjoys the
gift without worrying about the consequences that accompany gifts given
out of fear, guilt, shame, or desire for gain. The giver benefits from
the enhanced self-esteem that results when we see our efforts
contributing to someone’s well-being.</p>
<p>The use of NVC does not require that the persons with whom we are
communicating be literate in NVC or even motivated to relate to us
compassionately. If we stay with the principles of NVC, stay motivated
solely to give and receive compassionately, and do everything we can to
let others know this is our only motive, they will join us in the
process, and eventually we will be able to respond compassionately to
one another. I’m not saying that this always happens quickly. I do
maintain, however, that compassion inevitably blossoms when we stay true
to the principles and process of NVC.</p>
<h5 id="the-nvc-process">The NVC Process</h5>
<p>To arrive at a mutual desire to give from the heart, we focus the
light of consciousness on four areas—referred to as the four components
of the NVC model.</p>
<p>First, we observe what is actually happening in a situation: what are
we observing others saying or doing that is either enriching or not
enriching our life? The trick is to be able to articulate this
observation without introducing any judgment or evaluation—to simply say
what people are doing that we either like or don’t like. Next, we state
how we feel when we observe this action: are we hurt, scared, joyful,
amused, irritated? And thirdly, we say what needs of ours are connected
to the feelings we have identified. An awareness of these three
components is present when we use NVC to clearly and honestly express
how we are.</p>
<p>Four components of NVC:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>observations</p></li>
<li><p>feelings</p></li>
<li><p>needs</p></li>
<li><p>requests</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For example, a mother might express these three pieces to her teenage
son by saying, “Felix, when I see two balls of soiled socks under the
coffee table and another three next to the TV, I feel irritated because
I am needing more order in the rooms that we share in common.”</p>
<p>She would follow immediately with the fourth component—a very
specific request: “Would you be willing to put your socks in your room
or in the washing machine?” This fourth component addresses what we are
wanting from the other person that would enrich our lives or make life
more wonderful for us.</p>
<p>Thus, part of NVC is to express these four pieces of information very
clearly, whether verbally or by other means. The other part of this
communication consists of receiving the same four pieces of information
from others. We connect with them by first sensing what they are
observing, feeling, and needing; then we discover what would enrich
their lives by receiving the fourth piece—their request.</p>
<p>As we keep our attention focused on the areas mentioned, and help
others do likewise, we establish a flow of communication, back and
forth, until compassion manifests naturally: what I am observing,
feeling, and needing; what I am requesting to enrich my life; what you
are observing, feeling, and needing; what you are requesting to enrich
your life …</p>
<p>NVC Process</p>
<p>The concrete actions we observe that affect our well-being</p>
<p>How we feel in relation to what we observe</p>
<p>The needs, values, desires, etc. that create our feelings</p>
<p>The concrete actions we request in order to enrich our lives</p>
<p>When we use this process, we may begin either by expressing ourselves
or by empathically receiving these four pieces of information from
others. Although we will learn to listen for and verbally express each
of these components in Chapters 3–6, it is important to keep in mind
that NVC is not a set formula, but something that adapts to various
situations as well as personal and cultural styles. While I conveniently
refer to NVC as a “process” or “language,” it is possible to experience
all four pieces of the process without uttering a single word. The
essence of NVC is in our consciousness of the four components, not in
the actual words that are exchanged.</p>
<p>Two parts of NVC:</p>
<p>expressing honestly through the four components</p>
<p>receiving empathically through the four components</p>
<h5 id="applying-nvc-in-our-lives-and-the-world">Applying NVC in Our
Lives and the World</h5>
<p>When we use NVC in our interactions—with ourselves, with another
person, or in a group—we become grounded in our natural state of
compassion. It is therefore an approach that can be effectively applied
at all levels of communication and in diverse situations:</p>
<p>intimate relationships</p>
<p>families</p>
<p>schools</p>
<p>organizations and institutions</p>
<p>therapy and counseling relationships</p>
<p>diplomatic and business negotiations</p>
<p>disputes and conflicts of any nature</p>
<p>Some people use NVC to create greater depth and caring in their
intimate relationships:</p>
<p>When I learned how I can receive (hear), as well as give (express),
through using NVC, I went beyond feeling attacked and ‘doormattish’ to
really listening to words and extracting their underlying feelings. I
discovered a very hurting man to whom I had been married for
twenty-eight years. He had asked me for a divorce the weekend before the
〔NVC〕 workshop. To make a long story short, we are here
today—together, and I appreciate the contribution 〔NVC has〕 made to
our happy ending…. I learned to listen for feelings, to express my
needs, to accept answers that I didn’t always want to hear. He is not
here to make me happy, nor am I here to create happiness for him. We
have both learned to grow, to accept, and to love, so that we can each
be fulfilled.</p>
<p>—a workshop participant in San Diego, California</p>
<p>Others use it to build more effective relationships at work:</p>
<p>I have been using NVC in my special education classroom for about one
year. It can work even with children who have language delays, learning
difficulties, and behavior problems. One student in our classroom spits,
swears, screams, and stabs other students with pencils when they get
near his desk. I cue him with, ‘Please say that another way. Use your
giraffe talk.’ 〔Giraffe puppets are used in some workshops as a
teaching aid to demonstrate NVC.〕 He immediately stands up straight,
looks at the person toward whom his anger is directed, and says calmly,
‘Would you please move away from my desk? I feel angry when you stand so
close to me.’ The other students might respond with something like,
‘Sorry! I forgot it bothers you.’</p>
<p>I began to think about my frustration with this child and to try to
discover what I needed from him (besides harmony and order). I realized
how much time I had put into lesson planning and how my needs for
creativity and contribution were being short-circuited in order to
manage behavior. Also, I felt I was not meeting the educational needs of
the other students. When he was acting out in class, I began to say, ‘I
need you to share my attention.’ It might take a hundred cues a day, but
he got the message and would usually get involved in the lesson.</p>
<p>—a teacher in Chicago, Illinois</p>
<p>A doctor writes:</p>
<p>I use NVC more and more in my medical practice. Some patients ask me
whether I am a psychologist, saying that usually their doctors are not
interested in the way they live their lives or deal with their diseases.
NVC helps me understand what patients’ needs are and what they need to
hear at a given moment. I find this particularly helpful in relating to
patients with hemophilia and AIDS because there is so much anger and
pain that the patient/health care-provider relationship is often
seriously impaired. Recently a woman with AIDS, whom I have been
treating for the past five years, told me that what has helped her the
most have been my attempts to find ways for her to enjoy her daily life.
My use of NVC helps me a lot in this respect. Often in the past, when I
knew that a patient had a fatal disease, I myself would get caught in
the prognosis, and it was hard for me to sincerely encourage them to
live their lives. With NVC, I have developed a new consciousness as well
as a new language. I am amazed to see how much it fits in with my
medical practice. I feel more energy and joy in my work as I become
increasingly engaged in the dance of NVC.</p>
<p>—a physician in Paris, France</p>
<p>Still others use this process in the political arena. A French
cabinet member visiting her sister remarked how differently the sister
and her husband were communicating and responding to each other.
Encouraged by their descriptions of NVC, she mentioned that she was
scheduled the following week to negotiate some sensitive issues between
France and Algeria regarding adoption procedures. Though time was
limited, we dispatched a French-speaking trainer to Paris to work with
the cabinet minister. The minister later attributed much of the success
of her negotiations in Algeria to her newly acquired communication
techniques.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, during a workshop attended by Israelis of varying
political persuasions, participants used NVC to express themselves
regarding the highly contested issue of the West Bank. Many of the
Israeli settlers who have established themselves on the West Bank
believe that they are fulfilling a religious mandate by doing so, and
they are locked in conflict not only with Palestinians but also with
other Israelis who recognize the Palestinian hope for national
sovereignty in the region. During a session, one of my trainers and I
modeled empathic hearing through NVC and then invited participants to
take turns role-playing each other’s position. After twenty minutes, a
settler announced that she would be willing to consider relinquishing
her land claims and moving out of the West Bank into internationally
recognized Israeli territory if her political opponents could listen to
her in the way she had just been listened to.</p>
<p>Worldwide, NVC now serves as a valuable resource for communities
facing violent conflicts and severe ethnic, religious, or political
tensions. The spread of NVC training and its use in mediation by people
in conflict in Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Nigeria, Rwanda,
Sierra Leone, and elsewhere have been a source of particular
gratification for me. My associates and I were once in Belgrade for
three highly charged days training citizens working for peace. When we
first arrived, expressions of despair were visibly etched on the
trainees’ faces, for their country was then enmeshed in a brutal war in
Bosnia and Croatia. As the training progressed, we heard the ring of
laughter in their voices as they shared their profound gratitude and joy
for having found the empowerment they were seeking. Over the next two
weeks, during trainings in Croatia, Israel, and Palestine, we again saw
desperate citizens in war-torn countries regaining their spirits and
confidence from the NVC training they received.</p>
<p>I feel blessed to be able to travel throughout the world teaching
people a process of communication that gives them power and joy. Now,
with this book, I am pleased and excited to be able to share the
richness of Nonviolent Communication with you.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>NVC helps us connect with each other and ourselves in a way that
allows our natural compassion to flourish. It guides us to reframe the
way we express ourselves and listen to others by focusing our
consciousness on four areas: what we are observing, feeling, and
needing, and what we are requesting to enrich our lives. NVC fosters
deep listening, respect, and empathy and engenders a mutual desire to
give from the heart. Some people use NVC to respond compassionately to
themselves, some to create greater depth in their personal
relationships, and still others to build effective relationships at work
or in the political arena. Worldwide, NVC is used to mediate disputes
and conflicts at all levels.</p>
<p>NVC in Action</p>
<p>Interspersed throughout the book are dialogues entitled NVC in
Action. These dialogues intend to impart the flavor of an actual
exchange in which a speaker is applying the principles of Nonviolent
Communication. However, NVC is not simply a language or a set of
techniques for using words; the consciousness and intent that it
embraces may be expressed through silence, a quality of presence, as
well as through facial expressions and body language. The NVC in Action
dialogues you will be reading are necessarily distilled and abridged
versions of real-life exchanges, where moments of silent empathy,
stories, humor, gestures, and more would all contribute to a more
natural flow of connection between the two parties than might be
apparent when dialogues are condensed in print.</p>
<p>“Murderer, Assassin, Child-Killer!”</p>
<p>I was presenting Nonviolent Communication to about 170 Palestinian
Muslim men in a mosque at Dheisheh Refugee Camp in Bethlehem. Attitudes
toward Americans at that time were not favorable. As I was speaking, I
suddenly noticed a wave of muffled commotion fluttering through the
audience. “They’re whispering that you are American!” my translator
alerted me, just as a gentleman in the audience leapt to his feet.
Facing me squarely, he hollered at the top of his lungs, “Murderer!”
Immediately a dozen other voices joined him in chorus: “Assassin!”
“Child-killer!” “Murderer!”</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was able to focus my attention on what the man was
feeling and needing. In this case, I had some cues. On the way into the
refugee camp, I had seen several empty tear gas canisters that had been
shot into the camp the night before. Clearly marked on each canister
were the words Made in U.S.A. I knew that the refugees harbored a lot of
anger toward the United States for supplying tear gas and other weapons
to Israel.</p>
<p>I addressed the man who had called me a murderer:</p>
<p>MBR: Are you angry because you would like my government to use its
resources differently? (I didn’t know whether my guess was correct—what
was critical was my sincere effort to connect with his feeling and
need.)</p>
<p>Man: Damn right I’m angry! You think we need tear gas? We need
sewers, not your tear gas! We need housing! We need to have our own
country!</p>
<p>MBR: So you’re furious and would appreciate some support in improving
your living conditions and gaining political independence?</p>
<p>Man: Do you know what it’s like to live here for twenty-seven years
the way I have with my family—children and all? Have you got the
faintest idea what that’s been like for us?</p>
<p>MBR: Sounds like you’re feeling very desperate and you’re wondering
whether I or anybody else can really understand what it’s like to be
living under these conditions. Am I hearing you right?</p>
<p>Man: You want to understand? Tell me, do you have children? Do they
go to school? Do they have playgrounds? My son is sick! He plays in open
sewage! His classroom has no books! Have you seen a school that has no
books?</p>
<p>MBR: I hear how painful it is for you to raise your children here;
you’d like me to know that what you want is what all parents want for
their children—a good education, opportunity to play and grow in a
healthy environment …</p>
<p>Man: That’s right, the basics! Human rights—isn’t that what you
Americans call it? Why don’t more of you come here and see what kind of
human rights you’re bringing here!</p>
