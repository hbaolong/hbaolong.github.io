<h4 id="the-protective-use-of-force">The Protective Use of Force</h4>
<h5 id="when-the-use-of-force-is-unavoidable">When the Use of Force Is
Unavoidable</h5>
<p>When two disputing parties have each had an opportunity to fully
express what they are observing, feeling, needing, and requesting—and
each has empathized with the other—a resolution can usually be reached
that meets the needs of both sides. At the very least, the two can
agree, in goodwill, to disagree.</p>
<p>In some situations, however, the opportunity for such dialogue may
not exist, and the use of force may be necessary to protect life or
individual rights. For instance, the other party may be unwilling to
communicate, or imminent danger may not allow time for communication. In
these situations, we may need to resort to force. If we do, NVC requires
us to differentiate between the protective and the punitive uses of
force.</p>
<h5 id="the-thinking-behind-the-use-of-force">The Thinking Behind the
Use of Force</h5>
<p>The intention behind the protective use of force is to prevent injury
or injustice. The intention behind the punitive use of force is to cause
individuals to suffer for their perceived misdeeds. When we grab a child
who is running into the street to prevent the child from being injured,
we are applying protective force. The punitive use of force, on the
other hand, might involve physical or psychological attack, such as
spanking the child or saying, “How could you be so stupid! You should be
ashamed of yourself!”</p>
<p>When we exercise the protective use of force, we are focusing on the
life or rights we want to protect, without passing judgment on either
the person or the behavior. We are not blaming or condemning the child
who rushes into the street; our thinking is solely directed toward
protecting the child from danger. (For application of this kind of force
in social and political conflicts, see Robert Irwin’s book, Building a
Peace System.) The assumption behind the protective use of force is that
people behave in ways injurious to themselves and others due to some
form of ignorance. The corrective process is therefore one of education,
not punishment. Ignorance includes (1) a lack of awareness of the
consequences of our actions, (2) an inability to see how our needs may
be met without injury to others, (3) the belief that we have the right
to punish or hurt others because they “deserve” it, and (4) delusional
thinking that involves, for example, hearing a voice that instructs us
to kill someone.</p>
<p>The intention behind the protective use of force is only to protect,
not to punish, blame, or condemn.</p>
<p>Punitive action, on the other hand, is based on the assumption that
people commit offenses because they are bad or evil, and to correct the
situation, they need to be made to repent. Their “correction” is
undertaken through punitive action designed to make them (1) suffer
enough to see the error of their ways, (2) repent, and (3) change. In
practice, however, punitive action, rather than evoking repentance and
learning, is just as likely to generate resentment and hostility and to
reinforce resistance to the very behavior we are seeking.</p>
<h5 id="types-of-punitive-force">Types of Punitive Force</h5>
<p>Physical punishment, such as spanking, is one punitive use of force.
I have found the subject of corporal punishment to provoke strong
sentiments among parents. Some adamantly defend the practice, referring
to the Bible: “Spare the rod, spoil the child. It’s because parents
don’t spank that delinquency is now rampant.” They are persuaded that
spanking our children shows that we love them by setting clear
boundaries. Other parents are equally insistent that spanking is
unloving and ineffective because it teaches children that, when all else
fails, we can always resort to physical violence.</p>
<p>My personal concern is that children’s fear of corporal punishment
may obscure their awareness of the compassion that underlies parental
demands. Parents often tell me that they “have to” use punitive force
because they see no other way to influence their children to do “what’s
good for them.” They support their opinion with anecdotes of children
expressing appreciation for “seeing the light” after having been
punished. Having raised four children, I empathize deeply with parents
regarding the daily challenges they face in educating children and
keeping them safe. This does not, however, lessen my concern about the
use of physical punishment.</p>
<p>Fear of corporal punishment obscures children’s awareness of the
compassion underlying their parents’ demands.</p>
<p>First, I wonder whether people who proclaim the successes of such
punishment are aware of the countless instances of children who turn
against what might be good for them simply because they choose to fight,
rather than succumb, to coercion. Second, the apparent success of
corporal punishment in influencing a child doesn’t mean that other
methods of influence wouldn’t have worked equally well. Finally, I share
the concerns of many parents about the social consequences of using
physical punishment. When parents opt to use force, we may win the
battle of getting children to do what we want, but, in the process, are
we not perpetuating a social norm that justifies violence as a means of
resolving differences?</p>
<p>In addition to the physical, other uses of force also qualify as
punishment. One is the use of blame to discredit another person; for
example, a parent may label a child as “wrong,” “selfish,” or “immature”
when a child doesn’t behave in a certain way. Another form of punitive
force is the withholding of some means of gratification, such as
parents’ curtailing allowances or driving privileges. In this vein, the
withdrawal of caring or respect is one of the most powerful threats of
all.</p>
<p>Punishment also includes judgmental labeling and the withholding of
privileges.</p>
<h5 id="the-costs-of-punishment">The Costs of Punishment</h5>
<p>When we submit to doing something solely for the purpose of avoiding
punishment, our attention is distracted from the value of the action
itself. Instead, we are focusing upon the consequences, on what might
happen if we fail to take that action. If a worker’s performance is
prompted by fear of punishment, the job gets done, but morale suffers;
sooner or later, productivity will decrease. Self-esteem is also
diminished when punitive force is used. If children brush their teeth
because they fear shame and ridicule, their oral health may improve but
their self-respect will develop cavities. Furthermore, as we all know,
punishment is costly in terms of goodwill. The more we are seen as
agents of punishment, the harder it is for others to respond
compassionately to our needs.</p>
<p>When we fear punishment, we focus on consequences, not on our own
values.</p>
<p>Fear of punishment diminishes self-esteem and goodwill.</p>
<p>I was visiting a friend, a school principal, at his office when he
noticed through the window a big child hitting a smaller one. “Excuse
me,” he said as he leapt up and rushed to the playground. Grabbing the
larger child, he gave him a swat and scolded, “I’ll teach you not to hit
smaller people!” When the principal returned inside, I remarked, “I
don’t think you taught that child what you thought you were teaching
him. I suspect what he learned instead was not to hit people smaller
than he is when somebody bigger—like the principal—might be watching! If
anything, it seems to me that you have reinforced the notion that the
way to get what you want from somebody else is to hit them.”</p>
<p>In such situations, I recommend first empathizing with the child who
is behaving violently. For example, if I saw a child hit someone after
being called a name, I might empathize, “I’m sensing that you’re feeling
angry because you’d like to be treated with more respect.” If I guessed
correctly, and the child acknowledges this to be true, I would then
continue by expressing my own feelings, needs, and requests in the
situation without insinuating blame: “I’m feeling sad because I want us
to find ways to get respect that don’t turn people into enemies. I’d
like you to tell me if you’d be willing to explore with me some other
ways to get the respect you’re wanting.”</p>
<h5 id="two-questions-that-reveal-the-limitations-of-punishment">Two
Questions That Reveal the Limitations of Punishment</h5>
<p>Two questions help us see why we are unlikely to get what we want by
using punishment to change people’s behavior. The first question is:
What do I want this person to do that’s different from what he or she is
currently doing? If we ask only this first question, punishment may seem
effective, because the threat or exercise of punitive force may well
influence someone’s behavior. However, with the second question, it
becomes evident that punishment isn’t likely to work: What do I want
this person’s reasons to be for doing what I’m asking?</p>
<p>We seldom address the latter question, but when we do, we soon
realize that punishment and reward interfere with people’s ability to do
things motivated by the reasons we’d like them to have. I believe it is
critical to be aware of the importance of people’s reasons for behaving
as we request. For example, blaming or punishing would obviously not be
effective strategies if we want children to clean their rooms out of
either a desire for order or a desire to contribute to their parents’
enjoyment of order. Often children clean their rooms motivated by
obedience to authority (“Because my Mom said so”), avoidance of
punishment, or fear of upsetting or being rejected by parents. NVC,
however, fosters a level of moral development based on autonomy and
interdependence, whereby we acknowledge responsibility for our own
actions and are aware that our own well-being and that of others are one
and the same.</p>
<p>Question 1: What do I want this person to do?</p>
<p>Question 2: What do I want this person’s reasons to be for doing
it?</p>
<h5 id="the-protective-use-of-force-in-schools">The Protective Use of
Force in Schools</h5>
<p>I’d like to describe how some students and I used protective force to
bring order into a chaotic situation at an alternative school. This
school was designed for students who had dropped out or been expelled
from conventional classrooms. The administration and I hoped to
demonstrate that a school based on the principles of NVC would be able
to reach these students. My job was to train the faculty in NVC and
serve as consultant over the year. With only four days to prepare the
faculty, I was unable to sufficiently clarify the difference between NVC
and permissiveness. As a result, some teachers were ignoring, rather
than intervening in, situations of conflict and disturbing behavior.
Besieged by increasing pandemonium, the administrators were nearly ready
to shut down the school.</p>
<p>When I requested to talk with the students who had contributed most
to the turbulence, the principal selected eight boys, ages eleven to
fourteen, to meet with me. The following are excerpts from the dialogue
I had with the students.</p>
<p>MBR: (expressing my feeling and needs without asking probing
questions) I’m very upset about the teachers’ reports that things are
getting out of hand in many of the classes. I want very much for this
school to be successful. I’m hopeful that you can help me understand
what the problems are and what can be done about them.</p>
<p>Will: The teachers in this school—they fools, man!</p>
<p>MBR: Are you saying, Will, that you are disgusted with the teachers
and you want them to change some things they do?</p>
<p>Will: No, man, they is fools because they just stand around and don’t
do nothin’.</p>
<p>MBR: You mean you’re disgusted because you want them to do more when
problems happen. (This is a second attempt to receive the feelings and
wants.)</p>
<p>Will: That’s right, man. No matter what anybody do they just stand
there smilin’ like fools.</p>
<p>MBR: Would you be willing to give me an example of how the teachers
do nothing?</p>
<p>Will: Easy. Just this morning a dude walks in wearin’ a bottle of
Wild Turkey on his hip pocket plain as day. Everybody seen it; the
teacher, she seen it but she’s lookin’ the other way.</p>
<p>MBR: It sounds to me, then, that you don’t have respect for the
teachers when they stand around doing nothing. You’d like them to do
something. (This is a continued attempt to fully understand.)</p>
<p>Will: Yeah.</p>
<p>MBR: I feel disappointed because I want them to be able to work
things out with students, but it sounds like I wasn’t able to show them
what I meant.</p>
<p>The discussion then turned to one particularly pressing problem: that
of students who didn’t want to work disturbing those who did.</p>
<p>MBR: I’m anxious to try to solve this problem because the teachers
tell me it’s the one that bothers them the most. I would appreciate your
sharing whatever ideas you have with me.</p>
<p>Joe: The teacher got to get a rattan (a stick covered with leather
that was carried by some principals in St. Louis to administer corporal
punishment).</p>
<p>MBR: So you’re saying, Joe, that you want the teachers to hit
students when they bother others.</p>
<p>Joe: That’s the only way students gonna stop playing the fool.</p>
<p>MBR: (still trying to receive Joe’s feelings) So you doubt that any
other way would work.</p>
<p>Joe: (nods agreement)</p>
<p>MBR: I’m discouraged if that’s the only way. I hate that way of
settling things and want to learn other ways.</p>
<p>Ed: Why?</p>
<p>MBR: Several reasons. Like if I get you to stop horsing around in
school by using the rattan, I’d like you to tell me what happens if
three or four of you that I’ve hit in class are out by my car when I go
home.</p>
<p>Ed: (smiling) Then you better have a big stick, man!</p>
<p>MBR: (Feeling certain I understood Ed’s message and certain he knew I
understood, I continue without paraphrasing it.) That’s what I mean. I’d
like you to see I’m bothered about that way of settling things. I’m too
absentminded to always remember to carry a big stick, and even if I
remembered, I would hate to hit someone with it.</p>
<p>Ed: You could kick the cat out of school.</p>
<p>MBR: You’re suggesting, Ed, that you would like us to suspend or
expel kids from the school?</p>
<p>Ed: Yeah.</p>
<p>MBR: I’m discouraged with that idea, too. I want to show that there
are other ways of solving differences in school without kicking people
out. I’d feel like a failure if that was the best we could do.</p>
<p>Will: If a dude ain’t doin’ nothin’, how come you can’t put him in a
do-nothin’ room?</p>
<p>MBR: Are you suggesting, Will, that you would like to have a room to
send people to if they bother other students?</p>
<p>Will: That’s right. No use they bein’ in class if they ain’t doin’
nothin’.</p>
<p>MBR: I’m very interested in that idea. I’d like to hear how you think
such a room might work.</p>
<p>Will: Sometimes you come to school and just feel evil: you don’t want
to do nothin’. So we just have a room students go to till they feel like
doin’ somethin’.</p>
<p>MBR: I understand what you are saying, but I’m anticipating that the
teacher will be concerned about whether the students will go willingly
to the do-nothing room.</p>
<p>Will: (confidently) They’ll go.</p>
<p>I said I thought the plan might work if we could show that the
purpose was not to punish, but to provide a place to go for those who
weren’t ready to study, and simultaneously a chance to study for those
who wanted to study. I also suggested that a do-nothing room would be
more likely to succeed if it was known to be a product of student
brainstorming rather than staff decree.</p>
<p>A do-nothing room was set up for students who were upset and didn’t
feel like doing schoolwork or whose behavior kept others from learning.
Sometimes students asked to go; sometimes teachers asked students to go.
We placed the teacher who had best mastered NVC in the do-nothing room,
where she had some very productive talks with the children who came in.
This set-up was an immense success in restoring order to the school
because the students who devised it made its purpose clear to their
peers: to protect the rights of students who wanted to learn. We used
the dialogue with the students to demonstrate to the teachers that there
were other means of resolving conflicts besides withdrawal from the
conflict or using punitive force.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>In situations where there is no opportunity for communication, such
as in instances of imminent danger, we may need to resort to the
protective use of force. The intention behind the protective use of
force is to prevent injury or injustice, never to punish or to cause
individuals to suffer, repent, or change. The punitive use of force
tends to generate hostility and to reinforce resistance to the very
behavior we are seeking. Punishment damages goodwill and self-esteem,
and shifts our attention from the intrinsic value of an action to
external consequences. Blaming and punishing fail to contribute to the
motivations we would like to inspire in others.</p>
