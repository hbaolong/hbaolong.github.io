<h4 id="expressing-anger-fully">Expressing Anger Fully</h4>
<p>The subject of anger gives us a unique opportunity to dive more
deeply into NVC. Because it brings many aspects of this process into
sharp focus, the expression of anger clearly demonstrates the difference
between NVC and other forms of communication.</p>
<p>Hurting people is too superficial.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest that hitting, blaming, hurting others—whether
physically or emotionally—are all superficial expressions of what is
going on within us when we are angry. If we are truly angry, we would
want a much more powerful way to fully express ourselves.</p>
<p>This understanding comes as a relief to many groups I work with that
experience oppression and discrimination and want to increase their
power to effect change. Such groups are uneasy when they hear the terms
nonviolent or compassionate communication because they have so often
been urged to stifle their anger, calm down, and accept the status quo.
They worry about approaches that view their anger as an undesirable
quality needing to be purged. The process we are describing, however,
does not encourage us to ignore, squash, or swallow anger, but rather to
express the core of our anger fully and wholeheartedly.</p>
<h5 id="distinguishing-stimulus-from-cause">Distinguishing Stimulus From
Cause</h5>
<p>The first step to fully expressing anger in NVC is to divorce the
other person from any responsibility for our anger. We rid ourselves of
thoughts such as, “He (or she or they) made me angry when they did
that.” Such thinking leads us to express our anger superficially by
blaming or punishing the other person. Earlier we saw that the behavior
of others may be a stimulus for our feelings, but not the cause. We are
never angry because of what someone else did. We can identify the other
person’s behavior as the stimulus, but it is important to establish a
clear separation between stimulus and cause.</p>
<p>We are never angry because of what others say or do.</p>
<p>I’d like to illustrate this distinction with an example from my work
at a Swedish prison. My job was to show prisoners who had behaved in
violent ways how to fully express their anger rather than to kill, beat,
or rape other people. During an exercise calling on participants to
identify the stimulus of their anger, one prisoner wrote: “Three weeks
ago I made a request to the prison officials and they still haven’t
responded to it.” His statement was a clear observation of a stimulus,
describing what other people had done.</p>
<p>I then asked him to state the cause of his anger: “When this
happened, you felt angry because what?”</p>
<p>“I just told you,” he exclaimed. “I felt angry because they didn’t
respond to my request!” By equating stimulus and cause, he had tricked
himself into thinking that it was the behavior of the prison officials
that was making him angry. This is an easy habit to acquire in a culture
that uses guilt as a means of controlling people. In such cultures, it
becomes important to trick people into thinking that we can make others
feel a certain way.</p>
<p>Where guilt is a tactic of manipulation and coercion, it is useful to
confuse stimulus and cause. As mentioned earlier, children who hear, “It
hurts Mommy and Daddy when you get poor grades,” are led to believe that
their behavior is the cause of their parents’ pain. The same dynamic is
observed among intimate partners: “It really disappoints me when you’re
not here for my birthday.” The English language facilitates the use of
this guilt-inducing tactic.</p>
<p>To motivate by guilt, mix up stimulus and cause.</p>
<p>We say: “You make me angry.” “You hurt me by doing that.” “I feel sad
because you did that.” We use our language in many different ways to
trick ourselves into believing that our feelings result from what others
do. The first step in the process of fully expressing our anger is to
realize that what other people do is never the cause of how we feel.</p>
<p>The cause of anger lies in our thinking—in thoughts of blame and
judgment.</p>
<p>So what is the cause of anger? In Chapter 5, we discussed the four
options we have when confronted with a message or behavior that we don’t
like. Anger is generated when we choose the second option: whenever we
are angry, we are finding fault—we are choosing to play God by judging
or blaming the other person for being wrong or deserving punishment. I
would like to suggest that this is the cause of anger. Even if we are
not initially conscious of it, the cause of anger is located in our own
thinking.</p>
<p>The third option described in Chapter 5 is to shine the light of
consciousness on our own feelings and needs. Rather than going up to our
head to make a mental analysis of wrongness regarding somebody, we
choose to connect to the life that is within us. This life energy is
most palpable and accessible when we focus on what we need in each
moment.</p>
<p>For example, if someone arrives late for an appointment and we need
reassurance that she cares about us, we may feel hurt. If, instead, our
need is to spend time purposefully and constructively, we may feel
frustrated. But if our need is for thirty minutes of quiet solitude, we
may be grateful for her tardiness and feel pleased. Thus, it is not the
behavior of the other person but our own need that causes our feeling.
When we are connected to our need, whether it is for reassurance,
purposefulness, or solitude, we are in touch with our life energy. We
may have strong feelings, but we are never angry. Anger is a result of
life-alienating thinking that is disconnected from needs. It indicates
that we have moved up to our head to analyze and judge somebody rather
than focus on which of our needs are not getting met.</p>
<p>In addition to the third option of focusing on our own needs and
feelings, the choice is ours at any moment to shine the light of
consciousness on the other person’s feelings and needs. When we choose
this fourth option, we also never feel anger. We are not repressing the
anger; we see how anger is simply absent in each moment that we are
fully present with the other person’s feelings and needs.</p>
<h5 id="all-anger-has-a-life-serving-core">All Anger Has a Life-Serving
Core</h5>
<p>“But,” I am asked, “aren’t there circumstances in which anger is
justified? Isn’t ‘righteous indignation’ called for in the face of
careless, thoughtless pollution of the environment, for example?” My
answer is that I strongly believe that to whatever degree I support the
consciousness that there is such a thing as a “careless action” or a
“conscientious action,” a “greedy person” or a “moral person,” I am
contributing to violence on this planet. Rather than agreeing or
disagreeing about what people are for murdering, raping, or polluting
the environment, I believe we serve life better by focusing attention on
what we are needing.</p>
<p>When we judge others, we contribute to violence.</p>
<p>I see all anger as a result of life-alienating, violence-provoking
thinking. At the core of all anger is a need that is not being
fulfilled. Thus anger can be valuable if we use it as an alarm clock to
wake us up—to realize we have a need that isn’t being met and that we
are thinking in a way that makes it unlikely to be met. To fully express
anger requires full consciousness of our need. In addition, energy is
required to get the need met. Anger, however, co-opts our energy by
directing it toward punishing people rather than meeting our needs.
Instead of engaging in “righteous indignation,” I recommend connecting
empathically with our own needs or those of others. This may take
extensive practice, whereby over and over again, we consciously replace
the phrase “I am angry because they …” with “I am angry because I am
needing …”</p>
<p>Use anger as a wake-up call.</p>
<p>I once was taught a remarkable lesson while working with students in
a correctional school for children in Wisconsin. On two successive days
I was hit on the nose in remarkably similar ways. The first time, I
received a sharp blow across the nose from an elbow while interceding in
a fight between two students. I was so enraged it was all I could do to
keep myself from hitting back. (On the streets of Detroit where I grew
up, it took far less than an elbow in the nose to provoke me to rage.)
The second day: similar situation, same nose—and thus more physical
pain—but not a bit of anger!</p>
<p>Anger co-opts our energy by diverting it toward punitive actions.</p>
<p>Reflecting deeply that evening on this experience, I recognized how I
had labeled the first child in my mind as a “spoiled brat.” That image
was in my head before his elbow ever caught my nose, and when it did, it
was no longer simply an elbow hitting my nose. It was: “That obnoxious
brat has no right to do this!” I had another judgment about the second
child; I saw him as a “pathetic creature.” Since I had a tendency to
worry about this child, even though my nose was hurting and bleeding
much more severely, the second day I felt no rage at all. I could not
have received a more powerful lesson to help me see that it’s not what
the other person does, but the images and interpretations in my own head
that produce my anger.</p>
<h5 id="stimulus-versus-cause-practical-implications">Stimulus versus
Cause: Practical Implications</h5>
<p>I emphasize the distinction between cause and stimulus on practical
and tactical as well as on philosophical grounds. I’d like to illustrate
this point by returning to my dialogue with John, the Swedish
prisoner:</p>
<p>John: Three weeks ago I made a request to the prison officials and
they still haven’t responded to my request.</p>
<p>MBR: So when this happened, you felt angry because what?</p>
<p>John: I just told you. They didn’t respond to my request!</p>
<p>MBR: Hold it. Instead of saying, “I felt angry because they … ,” stop
and become conscious of what you’re telling yourself that’s making you
so angry.</p>
<p>John: I’m not telling myself anything.</p>
<p>MBR: Stop, slow down, just listen to what’s going on inside.</p>
<p>John: (after silently reflecting) I’m telling myself that they have
no respect for human beings; they are a bunch of cold, faceless
bureaucrats who don’t give a damn about anybody but themselves! They’re
a real bunch of …</p>
<p>MBR: Thanks, that’s enough. Now you know why you’re angry—it’s that
kind of thinking.</p>
<p>John: But what’s wrong with thinking that way?</p>
<p>MBR: I’m not saying there is anything wrong with thinking that way.
Notice if I say there is something wrong with you for thinking that way,
I’d be thinking the same way about you. I don’t say it’s wrong to judge
people, to call them faceless bureaucrats or to label their actions
inconsiderate or selfish. However, it’s that kind of thinking on your
part that makes you feel very angry. Focus your attention on your needs:
what are your needs in this situation?</p>
<p>John: (after a long silence) Marshall, I need the training I was
requesting. If I don’t get that training, as sure as I’m sitting here,
I’m gonna end up back in this prison when I get out.</p>
<p>MBR: Now that your attention is on your needs, how do you feel? John:
Scared.</p>
<p>MBR: Now put yourself in the shoes of a prison official. If I’m an
inmate, am I more likely to get my needs met if I come to you saying,
“Hey, I really need that training and I’m scared of what’s going to
happen if I don’t get it,” or if I approach while seeing you as a
faceless bureaucrat? Even if I don’t say those words out loud, my eyes
will reveal that kind of thinking. Which way am I more likely to get my
needs met? (John stares at the floor and remains silent.)</p>
<p>MBR: Hey, buddy, what’s going on?</p>
<p>John: Can’t talk about it.</p>
<p>When we become aware of our needs, anger gives way to life-serving
feelings.</p>
<p>Three hours later, John approached me and said, “Marshall, I wish you
had taught me two years ago what you taught me this morning. I wouldn’t
have had to kill my best friend.”</p>
<p>Violence comes from the belief that other people cause our pain and
therefore deserve punishment.</p>
<p>All violence is the result of people tricking themselves, as did this
young man, into believing that their pain derives from other people and
that consequently those people deserve to be punished.</p>
<p>One time I saw my younger son take a fifty-cent piece from his
sister’s room. I said, “Brett, did you ask your sister whether you could
have that?” “I didn’t take it from her,” he answered. Now I faced my
four options. I could have called him a liar, which would, however, have
worked against my getting my needs met since any judgment of another
person diminishes the likelihood of our needs being met. Where I focused
my attention at that moment was critical. If I were to judge him a liar,
it would point me in one direction. If I were to think that he didn’t
respect me enough to tell me the truth, I would be pointed in another
direction. If, however, I were either to empathize with him at that
moment, or express nakedly what I was feeling and needing, I would
greatly increase the possibility of getting my needs met.</p>
<p>We recall four options when hearing a difficult message:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Blame ourselves</p></li>
<li><p>Blame others</p></li>
<li><p>Sense our own feelings and needs</p></li>
<li><p>Sense others’ feelings and needs</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The way I expressed my choice—which in this situation turned out to
be helpful—was not so much through what I said, but through what I did.
Instead of judging him as lying, I tried to hear his feeling: he was
scared, and his need was to protect himself from being punished. By
empathizing with him, I had a chance of making an emotional connection
out of which we could both get our needs met. However, if I had
approached him with the view that he was lying—even if I hadn’t
expressed it out loud—he would have been less likely to feel safe
expressing truthfully what had happened. I would have then become part
of the process: by the very act of judging another person as a liar, I
would contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why would people want to
tell the truth, knowing they will be judged and punished for doing
so?</p>
<p>Judgments of others contribute to self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest that when our heads are filled with judgments
and analyses that others are bad, greedy, irresponsible, lying,
cheating, polluting the environment, valuing profit more than life, or
behaving in other ways they shouldn’t, very few of them will be
interested in our needs. If we want to protect the environment, and we
go to a corporate executive with the attitude, “You know, you are really
a killer of the planet, you have no right to abuse the land in this
way,” we have severely impaired our chances of getting our needs met. It
is a rare human being who can maintain focus on our needs when we are
expressing them through images of their wrongness. Of course, we may be
successful in using such judgments to intimidate people into meeting our
needs. If they feel so frightened, guilty, or ashamed that they change
their behavior, we may come to believe that it is possible to “win” by
telling people what’s wrong with them.</p>
<p>With a broader perspective, however, we realize that each time our
needs are met in this way, we not only lose, but we have contributed
very tangibly to violence on the planet. We may have solved an immediate
problem, but we will have created another one. The more people hear
blame and judgment, the more defensive and aggressive they become and
the less they will care about our needs in the future. So even if our
present need is met in the sense that people do what we want, we will
pay for it later.</p>
<h5 id="four-steps-to-expressing-anger">Four Steps to Expressing
Anger</h5>
<p>Let’s look at what the process of fully expressing our anger actually
requires in concrete form. The first step is to stop and do nothing
except to breathe. We refrain from making any move to blame or punish
the other person. We simply stay quiet. Then we identify the thoughts
that are making us angry. For example, we overhear a statement that
leads us to believe that we’ve been excluded from a conversation because
of race. We sense anger, stop, and recognize the thoughts stirring in
our head: “It’s unfair to act like that. She’s being racist.” We know
that all judgments like these are tragic expressions of unmet needs, so
we take the next step and connect to the needs behind those thoughts. If
we judge someone to be racist, the need may be for inclusion, equality,
respect, or connection.</p>
<p>Steps to expressing anger:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Stop. Breathe.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify our judgmental thoughts.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect with our needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Express our feelings and unmet needs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To fully express ourselves, we now open our mouth and speak the
anger—but the anger has been transformed into needs and need-connected
feelings. To articulate these feelings may require a lot of courage. For
me it’s easy to get angry and tell people, “That was a racist thing to
do!” In fact, I may even enjoy saying such things, but to get down to
the deeper feelings and needs behind such a statement may be very
frightening. To fully express our anger, we may say to the other person,
“When you entered the room and started talking to the others and didn’t
say anything to me, and then made the comment about white people, I felt
really sick to my stomach, and got so scared; it triggered off all kinds
of needs on my part to be treated equally. I’d like you to tell me how
you feel when I tell you this.”</p>
<h5 id="offering-empathy-first">Offering Empathy First</h5>
<p>In most cases, however, another step needs to take place before we
can expect the other party to connect with what is going on in us.
Because it will often be difficult for others to receive our feelings
and needs in such situations, if we want them to hear us we would need
first to empathize with them. The more we empathize with what leads them
to behave in the ways that are not meeting our needs, the more likely it
is that they will be able to reciprocate afterwards.</p>
<p>Over the last thirty years I’ve had a wealth of experience speaking
NVC with people who harbor strong beliefs about specific races and
ethnic groups. Early one morning I was picked up by a cab at an airport
to take me into town. A message from the dispatcher came over the
loudspeaker for the cabbie: “Pick up Mr. Fishman at the synagogue on
Main Street.” The man next to me in the cab muttered, “These kikes get
up early in the morning so they can screw everybody out of their
money.”</p>
<p>The more we hear them, the more they’ll hear us.</p>
<p>For twenty seconds, there was smoke coming out of my ears. In earlier
years, my first reaction would have been to want to physically hurt such
a person. Instead I took a few deep breaths and then gave myself some
empathy for the hurt, fear, and rage that were stirring inside me. I
attended to my feelings. I stayed conscious that my anger wasn’t coming
from my fellow passenger nor the statement he had just made. His comment
had triggered off a volcano inside of me, but I knew that my anger and
profound fear came from a far deeper source than those words he had just
uttered. I sat back and simply allowed the violent thoughts to play
themselves out. I even enjoyed the image of actually grabbing his head
and smashing it.</p>
<p>Giving myself this empathy enabled me to then focus my attention on
the humanness behind his message, after which the first words out of my
mouth were, “Are you feeling … ?” I tried to empathize with him, to hear
his pain. Why? Because I wanted to see the beauty in him, and I wanted
for him to fully apprehend what I had experienced when he made his
remark. I knew I wouldn’t receive that kind of understanding if there
were a storm brewing inside of him. My intention was to connect with him
and show a respectful empathy for the life energy in him that was behind
the comment. My experience told me that if I were able to empathize,
then he would be able to hear me in return. It would not be easy, but he
would be able to.</p>
<p>Stay conscious of the violent thoughts that arise in our minds,
without judging them.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling frustrated?” I asked. “It appears that you might
have had some bad experiences with Jewish people.”</p>
<p>He eyed me for a moment. “Yeah! These people are disgusting. They’ll
do anything for money.”</p>
<p>“You feel distrust and the need to protect yourself when you’re
involved in financial affairs with them?”</p>
<p>“That’s right!” he exclaimed, continuing to release more judgments,
as I listened for the feeling and need behind each one. When we settle
our attention on other people’s feelings and needs, we experience our
common humanity. When I hear that he’s scared and wants to protect
himself, I recognize how I also have a need to protect myself and I too
know what it’s like to be scared. When my consciousness is focused on
another human being’s feelings and needs, I see the universality of our
experience. I had a major conflict with what went on in his head, but
I’ve learned that I enjoy human beings more if I don’t hear what they
think. Especially with folks who have his kind of thoughts. I’ve learned
to savor life much more by only hearing what’s going on in their hearts
and not getting caught up with the stuff in their heads.</p>
<p>When we hear another person’s feelings and needs, we recognize our
common humanity.</p>
<p>This man kept on pouring out his sadness and frustration. Before I
knew it, he’d finished with Jews and moved on to blacks. He was charged
with pain around a number of subjects. After nearly ten minutes of my
just listening, he stopped: he had felt understood.</p>
<p>Then I let him know what was going on in me:</p>
<p>MBR: You know, when you first started to talk, I felt a lot of anger,
a lot of frustration, sadness, and discouragement, because I’ve had very
different experiences with Jews than you’ve had, and I was wanting you
to have much more the kind of experiences I’ve had. Can you tell me what
you heard me say?</p>
<p>Man: Oh, I’m not saying they’re all …</p>
<p>MBR: Excuse me, hold on, hold it. Can you tell me what you heard me
say?</p>
<p>Man: What are you talking about?</p>
<p>MBR: Let me repeat what I’m trying to say. I really want you to just
hear the pain I felt when I heard your words. It’s really important to
me that you hear that. I was saying I felt a real sense of sadness
because my experiences with Jewish people have been very different. I
was just wishing that you had had some experiences that were different
from the ones you were describing. Can you tell me what you heard me
say?</p>
<p>Man: You’re saying I have no right to talk the way I did.</p>
<p>MBR: No, I would like you to hear me differently. I really don’t want
to blame you. I have no desire to blame you.</p>
<p>Our need is for the other person to truly hear our pain.</p>
<p>I intended to slow down the conversation, because in my experience,
to whatever degree people hear blame, they have failed to hear our pain.
If this man said, “Those were terrible things for me to say; those were
racist remarks I made,” he would not have heard my pain. As soon as
people think that they have done something wrong, they will not be fully
apprehending our pain.</p>
<p>People do not hear our pain when they believe they are at fault.</p>
<p>I didn’t want him to hear blame, because I wanted him to know what
had gone on in my heart when he uttered his remark. Blaming is easy.
People are used to hearing blame; sometimes they agree with it and hate
themselves—which doesn’t stop them from behaving the same way—and
sometimes they hate us for calling them racists or whatever—which also
doesn’t stop their behavior. If we sense blame entering their mind, as I
did in the cab, we may need to slow down, go back, and hear their pain
for a while more.</p>
<h5 id="taking-our-time">Taking Our Time</h5>
<p>Probably the most important part of learning how to live the process
we have been discussing is to take our time. We may feel awkward
deviating from the habitual behaviors that our conditioning has rendered
automatic, but if our intention is to consciously live life in harmony
with our values, then we’ll want to take our time.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, Sam Williams, jotted down the basic components of
the NVC process on a three-by-five card, which he would use as a cheat
sheet at work. When his boss would confront him, Sam would stop, refer
to the card in his hand, and take time to remember how to respond. When
I asked whether his colleagues were finding him a little strange,
constantly staring into his hand and taking so much time to form his
sentences, Sam replied, “It doesn’t actually take that much more time,
but even if it did, it’s still worth it to me. It’s important for me to
know that I am responding to people the way I really want to.” At home
he was more overt, explaining to his wife and children why he was taking
the time and trouble to consult the card. Whenever there was an argument
in the family, he would pull out the card and take his time. After about
a month, he felt comfortable enough to put it away. Then one evening, he
and Scottie, age four, were having a conflict over television and it
wasn’t going well. “Daddy,” Scottie said urgently, “get the card!”</p>
<p>For those of you wishing to apply NVC, especially in challenging
situations of anger, I would suggest the following exercise. As we have
seen, our anger comes from judgments, labels, and thoughts of blame, of
what people “should” do and what they “deserve.” List the judgments that
float most frequently in your head by using the cue, “I don’t like
people who are …” Collect all such negative judgments in your head and
then ask yourself, “When I make that judgment of a person, what am I
needing and not getting?” In this way, you train yourself to frame your
thinking in terms of unmet needs rather than in terms of judgments of
other people.</p>
<p>Practice translating each judgment into an unmet need.</p>
<p>Take your time.</p>
<p>Practice is essential, because most of us were raised, if not on the
streets of Detroit, then somewhere only slightly less violent. Judging
and blaming have become second nature to us. To practice NVC, we need to
proceed slowly, think carefully before we speak, and often just take a
deep breath and not speak at all. Learning the process and applying it
both take time.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Blaming and punishing others are superficial expressions of anger. If
we wish to fully express anger, the first step is to divorce the other
person from any responsibility for our anger. Instead we shine the light
of consciousness on our own feelings and needs. By expressing our needs,
we are far more likely to get them met than by judging, blaming, or
punishing others.</p>
<p>The four steps to expressing anger are (1) stop and breathe, (2)
identify our judgmental thoughts, (3) connect with our needs, and (4)
express our feelings and unmet needs. Sometimes, in between steps 3 and
4, we may choose to empathize with the other person so that he or she
will be better able to hear us when we express ourselves in step 4.</p>
<p>We need to take our time both in learning and in applying the process
of NVC.</p>
<p>NVC in Action</p>
<p>Parent and Teen Dialogue: A Life-Threatening Issue</p>
<p>In this situation, fifteen-year-old Bill took a car, without
permission, from Jorge, a family friend. He went on a joy ride with two
friends and returned the car undamaged to the garage, where its absence
had not been detected. Since then, however, Jorge’s fourteen-year-old
daughter, Eva, who had gone along for the ride, told her father what had
happened. Jorge informed Bill’s father, who is now approaching his son.
The father has just recently been practicing NVC.</p>
<p>Father: So I hear you, Eva, and Dave took Jorge’s car without
asking.</p>
<p>Bill: No, we didn’t!</p>
<p>Father: (in a loud voice) Don’t lie to me; it’ll only make it
worse!</p>
<p>Then he remembered to first connect to his own feelings and needs in
order to stay in connection with his son.</p>
<p>Father: You just sit there for a moment; I need to think.</p>
<p>Going inside himself, he saw how angry and scared he was. Angry when
telling himself, “Bill should have known better!” and “What a liar he’s
become!” Scared when he thinks of all the potential consequences of not
only Bill’s action, but his own misjudgment of what his son might
do.</p>
<p>Father: (silently to himself) That was stupid of me to assume he
knows better. Someone could have gotten killed in this! (then catching
himself) Oops, I need to translate the labels “stupid” and “liar” into
feelings and needs. For “stupid,” I guess the feeling is disappointment
in myself: I would have liked to think that I knew him better. And as
for “liar,” I’m feeling pretty scared because I want to be able to count
on getting accurate information to deal with this situation.</p>
<p>Father: (out loud, after silence while he mulls over how to begin
talking) Bill, are you worried that you’d be punished if you gave me
accurate information?</p>
<p>Bill: Yeah, you’re always so mean whenever I do anything you don’t
like.</p>
<p>Father: Are you saying you’d like more understanding and fairer
treatment for what you do?</p>
<p>Bill: Oh, sure, like I’m really gonna get fair treatment and
understanding from you!</p>
<p>Father: (silently to himself) Boy, do I get angry when he says that!
Can’t he see how hard I’m trying? I really need a little respect for how
hard this is, and I guess also a little caring for how scared I’m
feeling.</p>
<p>Father: (out loud to Bill) Sounds to me like you’re worried that no
matter what you say, you won’t be treated fairly?</p>
<p>Bill: What do you care about treating me fairly? When something
happens, you just want someone to punish. Besides, what’s the big deal?
Even if we did take the car, no one got hurt and it’s back where it was.
I mean, this is no major crime wave.</p>
<p>Father: Are you scared there’ll be harsh consequences if you admit to
taking the car, and you want to trust that you’ll be treated justly?</p>
<p>Bill: Yeah.</p>
<p>Father: (allowing time for silence and the connection to go deeper)
What could I do to give you that reassurance?</p>
<p>Bill: Promise to never punish me again.</p>
<p>Father: (Aware that punishment will not help Bill develop
consciousness around potential consequences of his behavior, but will
only contribute to greater disconnection and resistance, Bill’s father
expresses willingness to agree to Bill’s request.) I’d be open to that
agreement if you agree to stay in dialogue with me. That is, we talk
until I’m satisfied you’re aware of all the possible consequences of
your having taken that car. However, in the future, if it happens that
I’m not confident that you see the potential danger of what you’re in
for, I might still use force—but only in order to protect you.</p>
<p>Bill: Wow, great! It really feels good knowing I’m so stupid you have
to use force to protect me from myself!</p>
<p>Father: (losing touch with his own needs, but silently) Man, there
are times when I could just kill the little … I’m so furious when he
says things like that! It really doesn’t seem like he cares…. Damn, what
am I needing here? I’m needing to know, when I’m working this hard, that
at least he cares.)</p>
<p>Father: (out loud, angrily) You know, Bill, when you say things like
that, I get really pissed off. I’m trying so hard to stay with you on
this, and when I hear things like that … Look, I need to know if you
even want to keep talking with me.</p>
<p>Bill: I don’t care.</p>
<p>Father: Bill, I really want to listen to you rather than fall into my
old habits of blaming and threatening you whenever something comes up
that I’m upset about. But when I hear you say things like, “It feels
good to know I’m so stupid,” in the tone of voice you just used, I find
it hard to control myself. I could use your help on this. That is, if
you would rather me listen to you than blame or threaten. Or if not,
then, I suppose my other option is to just handle this the way I’m used
to handling things.</p>
<p>Bill: And what would that be?</p>
<p>Father: Well, by now, I’d probably be saying, “Hey, you’re grounded
for two years: no TV, no car, no money, no dates, no nothing!”</p>
<p>Bill: Well, I guess I’d want you to do it the new way then.</p>
<p>Father: (with humor) I’m glad to see that your sense of
self-preservation is still intact. Now I need you to tell me whether
you’re willing to share some honesty and vulnerability.</p>
<p>Bill: What do you mean by “vulnerability”?</p>
<p>Father: It means that you tell me what you are really feeling about
the things we’re talking about, and I tell you the same from my end. (in
a firm voice) Are you willing?</p>
<p>Bill: Okay, I’ll try.</p>
<p>Father: (with sigh of relief) Thank you. I’m grateful for your
willingness to try. Did I tell you—Jorge grounded Eva for three
months—she won’t be allowed to do anything. How do you feel about
that?</p>
<p>Bill: Oh man, what a bummer; that’s so unfair!</p>
<p>Father: I’d like to hear how you really feel about it.</p>
<p>Bill: I told you—it’s totally unfair!</p>
<p>Father: (realizing Bill isn’t in touch with what he’s feeling,
decides to guess) Are you sad that she’s having to pay so much for her
mistake?</p>
<p>Bill: No, it’s not that. I mean, it wasn’t her mistake really.</p>
<p>Father: Oh, so are you upset she’s paying for something that was your
idea to start with?</p>
<p>Bill: Well, yeah, she just went along with what I told her to do.</p>
<p>Father: Sounds to me like you’re kind of hurting inside seeing the
kind of effect your decision had on Eva.</p>
<p>Bill: Sorta.</p>
<p>Father: Billy, I really need to know that you are able to see how
your actions have consequences.</p>
<p>Bill: Well, I wasn’t thinking about what could’ve gone wrong. Yeah, I
guess I did really screw up bad.</p>
<p>Father: I’d rather you see it as something you did that didn’t turn
out the way you wanted. And I still need reassurance about your being
aware of the consequences. Would you tell me what you’re feeling right
now about what you did?</p>
<p>Bill: I feel really stupid, Dad…. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone.</p>
<p>Father: (translating Bill’s self-judgments into feelings and needs)
So you’re sad, and regret what you did because you’d like to be trusted
not to do harm?</p>
<p>Bill: Yeah, I didn’t mean to cause so much trouble. I just didn’t
think about it.</p>
<p>Father: Are you saying you wish you had thought about it more and
gotten clearer before you acted?</p>
<p>Bill: (reflecting) Yeah …</p>
<p>Father: Well, it’s reassuring for me to hear that, and for there to
be some real healing with Jorge, I would like you to go to him and tell
him what you just told me. Would you be willing to do that?</p>
<p>Bill: Oh man, that’s so scary; he’ll be really mad!</p>
<p>Father: Yeah, it’s likely he will be. That’s one of the consequences.
Are you willing to be responsible for your actions? I like Jorge and I
want to keep him for a friend, and I’m guessing that you would like to
keep your connection with Eva. Is that the case?</p>
<p>Bill: She’s one of my best friends.</p>
<p>Father: So shall we go see them?</p>
<p>Bill: (fearfully and reluctantly) Well … okay. Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p>Father: Are you scared and needing to know that you will be safe if
you go there?</p>
<p>Bill: Yeah.</p>
<p>Father: We’ll go together: I’ll be there for you and with you. I’m
really proud that you are willing.</p>
