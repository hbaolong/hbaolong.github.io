<h4 id="observing-without-evaluating">Observing Without Evaluating</h4>
<p>OBSERVE!! There are few things as important, as religious, as
that.</p>
<p>—Frederick Buechner, minister</p>
<p>I can handle your telling me</p>
<p>what I did or didn’t do.</p>
<p>And I can handle your interpretations,</p>
<p>but please don’t mix the two.</p>
<p>If you want to confuse any issue,</p>
<p>I can tell you how to do it:</p>
<p>Mix together what I do</p>
<p>with how you react to it.</p>
<p>Tell me that you’re disappointed</p>
<p>with the unfinished chores you see,</p>
<p>But calling me “irresponsible”</p>
<p>is no way to motivate me.</p>
<p>And tell me that you’re feeling hurt</p>
<p>when I say “no” to your advances,</p>
<p>But calling me a frigid man</p>
<p>won’t increase your future chances.</p>
<p>Yes, I can handle your telling me</p>
<p>what I did or didn’t do,</p>
<p>And I can handle your interpretations,</p>
<p>but please don’t mix the two.</p>
<p>—Marshall B. Rosenberg, PhD</p>
<p>The first component of NVC entails the separation of observation from
evaluation. We need to clearly observe what we are seeing, hearing, or
touching that is affecting our sense of well-being, without mixing in
any evaluation.</p>
<p>Observations are an important element in NVC, where we wish to
clearly and honestly express how we are to another person. When we
combine observation with evaluation, we decrease the likelihood that
others will hear our intended message. Instead, they are apt to hear
criticism and thus resist whatever we are saying.</p>
<p>NVC does not mandate that we remain completely objective and refrain
from evaluating. It only requires that we maintain a separation between
our observations and our evaluations. NVC is a process language that
discourages static generalizations; instead, evaluations are to be based
on observations specific to time and context. Semanticist Wendell
Johnson pointed out that we create many problems for ourselves by using
static language to express or capture a reality that is ever changing:
“Our language is an imperfect instrument created by ancient and ignorant
men. It is an animistic language that invites us to talk about stability
and constants, about similarities and normal and kinds, about magical
transformations, quick cures, simple problems, and final solutions. Yet
the world we try to symbolize with this language is a world of process,
change, differences, dimensions, functions, relationships, growths,
interactions, developing, learning, coping, complexity. And the mismatch
of our ever-changing world and our relatively static language forms is
part of our problem.”</p>
<p>When we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear
criticism.</p>
<p>A colleague of mine, Ruth Bebermeyer, contrasts static and process
language in a song that illustrates the difference between evaluation
and observation:</p>
<p>I’ve never seen a lazy man;</p>
<p>I’ve seen a man who never ran</p>
<p>while I watched him, and I’ve seen</p>
<p>a man who sometimes slept between</p>
<p>lunch and dinner, and who’d stay</p>
<p>at home upon a rainy day,</p>
<p>but he was not a lazy man.</p>
<p>Before you call me crazy,</p>
<p>think, was he a lazy man or</p>
<p>did he just do things we label “lazy”?</p>
<p>I’ve never seen a stupid kid;</p>
<p>I’ve seen a kid who sometimes did</p>
<p>things I didn’t understand</p>
<p>or things in ways I hadn’t planned;</p>
<p>I’ve seen a kid who hadn’t seen</p>
<p>the same places where I had been,</p>
<p>but he was not a stupid kid.</p>
<p>Before you call him stupid,</p>
<p>think, was he a stupid kid or did he</p>
<p>just know different things than you did?</p>
<p>I’ve looked as hard as I can look</p>
<p>but never ever seen a cook;</p>
<p>I saw a person who combined</p>
<p>ingredients on which we dined,</p>
<p>A person who turned on the heat</p>
<p>and watched the stove that cooked the meat—</p>
<p>I saw those things but not a cook.</p>
<p>Tell me, when you’re looking,</p>
<p>Is it a cook you see or is it someone</p>
<p>doing things that we call cooking?</p>
<p>What some of us call lazy</p>
<p>some call tired or easy-going,</p>
<p>what some of us call stupid</p>
<p>some just call a different knowing,</p>
<p>so I’ve come to the conclusion,</p>
<p>it will save us all confusion</p>
<p>if we don’t mix up what we can see</p>
<p>with what is our opinion.</p>
<p>Because you may, I want to say also;</p>
<p>I know that’s only my opinion.</p>
<p>—Ruth Bebermeyer</p>
<p>While the effects of negative labels such as “lazy” and “stupid” may
be more obvious, even a positive or an apparently neutral label such as
“cook” limits our perception of the totality of another person’s
being.</p>
<h5 id="the-highest-form-of-human-intelligence">The Highest Form of
Human Intelligence</h5>
<p>The Indian philosopher J. Krishnamurti once remarked that observing
without evaluating is the highest form of human intelligence. When I
first read this statement, the thought, “What nonsense!” shot through my
mind before I realized that I had just made an evaluation. For most of
us, it is difficult to make observations, especially of people and their
behavior, that are free of judgment, criticism, or other forms of
analysis.</p>
<p>I became acutely aware of this difficulty while working with an
elementary school where the staff and principal had often reported
communication difficulties. The district superintendent had requested
that I help them resolve the conflict. First I was to confer with the
staff, and then with the staff and principal together.</p>
<p>I opened the meeting by asking the staff, “What is the principal
doing that conflicts with your needs?”</p>
<p>“He has a big mouth!” came the swift response. My question called for
an observation, but while “big mouth” gave me information on how this
teacher evaluated the principal, it failed to describe what the
principal said or did that led to the interpretation that he had a “big
mouth.”</p>
<p>When I pointed this out, a second teacher offered, “I know what he
means: the principal talks too much!” Instead of a clear observation of
the principal’s behavior, this was also an evaluation—of how much the
principal talked. A third teacher then declared, “He thinks only he has
anything worth saying.” I explained that inferring what another person
is thinking is not the same as observing his behavior. Finally a fourth
teacher ventured, “He wants to be the center of attention all the time.”
After I remarked that this too was an inference—of what another person
is wanting—two teachers blurted in unison, “Well, your question is very
hard to answer!”</p>
<p>We subsequently worked together to create a list identifying specific
behaviors, on the part of the principal, that bothered them, and made
sure that the list was free of evaluation. For example, the principal
told stories about his childhood and war experiences during faculty
meetings, with the result that meetings sometimes ran twenty minutes
overtime. When I asked whether they had ever communicated their
annoyance to the principal, the staff replied that they had tried, but
only through evaluative comments. They had never made reference to
specific behaviors—such as his storytelling—and they agreed to bring
these up when we were all to meet together.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as the meeting began, I saw what the staff had been
telling me. No matter what was being discussed, the principal would
interject, “This reminds me of the time …” and then launch into a story
about his childhood or war experience. I waited for the staff to voice
their discomfort around the principal’s behavior. However, instead of
Nonviolent Communication, they applied nonverbal condemnation. Some
rolled their eyes; others yawned pointedly; one stared at his watch.</p>
<p>I endured this painful scenario until finally I asked, “Isn’t anyone
going to say something?” An awkward silence ensued. The teacher who had
spoken first at our meeting screwed up his courage, looked directly at
the principal, and said, “Ed, you have a big mouth.”</p>
<p>As this story illustrates, it’s not always easy to shed our old
habits and master the ability to separate observation from evaluation.
Eventually, the teachers succeeded in clarifying for the principal the
specific actions that led to their concern. The principal listened
earnestly and then pressed, “Why didn’t one of you tell me before?” He
admitted he was aware of his storytelling habit, and then began a story
pertaining to this habit! I interrupted him, observing (good-naturedly)
that he was doing it again. We ended our meeting by developing ways for
the staff to let their principal know, in a gentle way, when his stories
weren’t appreciated.</p>
<h5 id="distinguishing-observations-from-evaluations">Distinguishing

<p>The following table distinguishes observations that are separate from
evaluation from those that have evaluation mixed in.</p>

</ol>
<p>Note: The words always, never, ever, whenever, etc. express
observations when used in the following ways:</p>
<p>Whenever I have observed Jack on the phone, he has spoken for at
least thirty minutes.</p>
<p>I cannot recall your ever writing to me.</p>
<p>Sometimes such words are used as exaggerations, in which case
observations and evaluations are being mixed:</p>
<p>You are always busy.</p>
<p>She is never there when she’s needed.</p>
<p>When these words are used as exaggerations, they often provoke
defensiveness rather than compassion.</p>
<p>Words like frequently and seldom can also contribute to confusing
observation with evaluation.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The first component of NVC entails the separation of observation from
evaluation. When we combine observation with evaluation, others are apt
to hear criticism and resist what we are saying. NVC is a process
language that discourages static generalizations. Instead, observations
are to be made specific to time and context, for example, “Hank Smith
has not scored a goal in twenty games,” rather than “Hank Smith is a
poor soccer player.”</p>
<p>NVC in Action</p>
<p>“The Most Arrogant Speaker We’ve Ever Had!”</p>
<p>This dialogue occurred during a workshop I was conducting. About half
an hour into my presentation, I paused to invite reactions from the
participants. One of them raised a hand and declared, “You’re the most
arrogant speaker we’ve ever had!”</p>
<p>I have several options open to me when people address me this way.
One option is to take the message personally; I know I’m doing this when
I have a strong urge to either grovel, defend myself, or make excuses.
Another option (for which I am well-rehearsed) is to attack the other
person for what I perceive as their attack upon me. On this occasion, I
chose a third option by focusing on what might be going on behind the
man’s statement.</p>
<p>MBR: (guessing at the observations being made) Are you reacting to my
having taken thirty straight minutes to present my views before giving
you a chance to talk?</p>
<p>Phil: No, you make it sound so simple.</p>
<p>MBR: (trying to obtain further clarification) Are you reacting to my
not having said anything about how the process can be difficult for some
people to apply?</p>
<p>Phil: No, not some people—you!</p>
<p>MBR: So you’re reacting to my not having said that the process can be
difficult for me at times? Phil: That’s right.</p>
<p>MBR: Are you feeling annoyed because you would have liked some sign
from me that indicated that I have some problems with the process
myself?</p>
<p>Phil: (after a moment’s pause) That’s right.</p>
<p>MBR: (feeling more relaxed now that I am in touch with the person’s
feeling and need, I direct my attention to what he might be requesting
of me) Would you like me to admit right now that this process can be a
struggle for me to apply?</p>
<p>Phil: Yes.</p>
<p>MBR: (having gotten clear on his observation, feeling, need, and
request, I check inside myself to see if I am willing to do as he
requests) Yes, this process is often difficult for me. As we continue
with the workshop, you’ll probably hear me describe several incidents
where I’ve struggled … or completely lost touch … with this process,
this consciousness, that I am presenting here to you. But what keeps me
in the struggle are the close connections to other people that happen
when I do stay with the process.</p>
<p>Exercise 1</p>
<p>OBSERVATION OR EVALUATION?</p>
<p>To determine your proficiency at discerning between observations and
evaluations, complete the following exercise. Circle the number in front
of each statement that is an observation only, with no evaluation mixed
in.</p>
<p>“John was angry with me yesterday for no reason.”</p>
<p>“Yesterday evening Nancy bit her fingernails while watching
television.”</p>
<p>“Sam didn’t ask for my opinion during the meeting.”</p>
<p>“My father is a good man.”</p>
<p>“Janice works too much.”</p>
<p>“Henry is aggressive.”</p>
<p>“Pam was first in line every day this week.”</p>
<p>“My son often doesn’t brush his teeth.”</p>
<p>“Luke told me I didn’t look good in yellow.”</p>
<p>“My aunt complains when I talk with her.”</p>
<p>Here are my responses for Exercise 1:</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. I consider “for
no reason” to be an evaluation. Furthermore, I consider it an evaluation
to infer that John was angry. He might have been feeling hurt, scared,
sad, or something else. Examples of observations without evaluation
might be: “John told me he was angry,” or “John pounded his fist on the
table.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that an observation
was expressed without being mixed together with an evaluation.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that an observation
was expressed without being mixed together with an evaluation.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. I consider “good
man” to be an evaluation. An observation without evaluation might be:
“For the last twenty-five years, my father has given one-tenth of his
salary to charity.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. I consider “too
much” to be an evaluation. An observation without evaluation might be:
“Janice spent more than sixty hours at the office this week.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. I consider
“aggressive” to be an evaluation. An observation without evaluation
might be: “Henry hit his sister when she switched the television
channel.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that an observation
was expressed without being mixed together with an evaluation.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. I consider
“often” to be an evaluation. An observation without evaluation might be:
“Twice this week my son didn’t brush his teeth before going to bed.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that an observation
was expressed without being mixed together with an evaluation.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. I consider
“complains” to be an evaluation. An observation without evaluation might
be: “My aunt called me three times this week, and each time talked about
people who treated her in ways she didn’t like.”</p>
<p>The Mask</p>
<p>Always a mask</p>
<p>Held in the slim hand whitely</p>
<p>Always she had a mask before her</p>
<p>face—</p>
<p>Truly the wrist</p>
<p>Holding it lightly</p>
<p>Fitted the task:</p>
<p>Sometimes however</p>
<p>Was there a shiver,</p>
<p>Fingertip quiver,</p>
<p>Ever so slightly—</p>
<p>Holding the mask?</p>
<p>For years and years and years I</p>
<p>wondered</p>
<p>But dared not ask</p>
<p>And then—</p>
<p>I blundered,</p>
<p>Looked behind the mask,</p>
<p>To find</p>
<p>Nothing—</p>
<p>She had no face.</p>
<p>She had become</p>
<p>Merely a hand</p>
<p>Holding a mask</p>
<p>With grace.</p>
