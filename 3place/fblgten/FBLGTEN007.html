<h4 id="requesting-that-which-would-enrich-life">Requesting That Which
Would Enrich Life</h4>
<p>We have now covered the first three components of NVC, which address
what we are observing, feeling, and needing. We have learned to do this
without criticizing, analyzing, blaming, or diagnosing others, and in a
way likely to inspire compassion. The fourth and final component of this
process addresses what we would like to request of others in order to
enrich life for us. When our needs are not being fulfilled, we follow
the expression of what we are observing, feeling, and needing with a
specific request: we ask for actions that might fulfill our needs. How
do we express our requests so that others are more willing to respond
compassionately to our needs?</p>
<h5 id="using-positive-action-language">Using Positive Action
Language</h5>
<p>First of all, we express what we are requesting rather than what we
are not requesting. “How do you do a don’t?” goes a line of a children’s
song by my colleague Ruth Bebermeyer: “All I know is I feel won’t when
I’m told to do a don’t.” These lyrics reveal two problems commonly
encountered when requests are worded in the negative. People are often
confused as to what is actually being requested, and furthermore,
negative requests are likely to provoke resistance.</p>
<p>Use positive language when making requests.</p>
<p>A woman at a workshop, frustrated that her husband was spending so
much time at work, described how her request had backfired: “I asked him
not to spend so much time at work. Three weeks later, he responded by
announcing that he’d signed up for a golf tournament!” She had
successfully communicated to him what she did not want—his spending so
much time at work—but had failed to request what she did want.
Encouraged to reword her request, she thought a minute and said, “I wish
I had told him that I would like him to spend at least one evening a
week at home with the children and me.”</p>
<p>During the Vietnam War, I was asked to debate the war issue on
television with a man whose position differed from mine. The show was
videotaped, so I was able to watch it at home that evening. When I saw
myself on the screen communicating in ways I didn’t want to be
communicating, I felt very upset. “If I’m ever in another discussion,” I
told myself, “I am determined not to do what I did on that program! I’m
not going to be defensive. I’m not going to let them make a fool of me.”
Notice how I spoke to myself in terms of what I didn’t want to do rather
than in terms of what I did want to do.</p>
<p>A chance to redeem myself came the very next week when I was invited
to continue the debate on the same program. All the way to the studio, I
repeated to myself all the things I didn’t want to do. As soon as the
program started, the man launched off in exactly the same way he had a
week earlier. For about ten seconds after he’d finished talking, I
managed not to communicate in the ways I had been reminding myself. In
fact, I said nothing. I just sat there. As soon as I opened my mouth,
however, I found words tumbling out in all the ways I had been so
determined to avoid! It was a painful lesson about what can happen when
I only identify what I don’t want to do, without clarifying what I do
want to do.</p>
<p>I was once invited to work with some high school students who
suffered a long litany of grievances against their principal. They
regarded the principal as racist, and searched for ways to get even with
him. A minister who worked closely with the young people became deeply
concerned over the prospect of violence. Out of respect for the
minister, the students agreed to meet with me.</p>
<p>They began by describing what they saw as discrimination on the part
of the principal. After listening to several of their charges, I
suggested that they proceed by clarifying what they wanted from the
principal.</p>
<p>“What good would that do?” scoffed one student in disgust. “We
already went to him to tell him what we wanted. His answer to us was,
‘Get out of here! I don’t need you people telling me what to do!’”</p>
<p>I asked the students what they had requested of the principal. They
recalled saying to him that they didn’t want him telling them how to
wear their hair. I suggested that they might have received a more
cooperative response if they had expressed what they did, rather than
what they did not, want. They had then informed the principal that they
wanted to be treated with fairness, at which he had become defensive,
vociferously denying ever having been unfair. I ventured to guess that
the principal would have responded more favorably if they had asked for
specific actions rather than vague behavior like “fair treatment.”</p>
<p>Working together, we found ways to express their requests in positive
action language. At the end of the meeting, the students had clarified
thirty-eight actions they wanted the principal to take, including “We’d
like you to agree to black student representation on decisions made
about dress code,” and “We’d like you to refer to us as ‘black students’
and not ‘you people.’” The following day, the students presented their
requests to the principal using the positive action language we had
practiced; that evening I received an elated phone call from them: their
principal had agreed to all thirty-eight requests!</p>
<p>In addition to using positive language, we also want to word our
requests in the form of concrete actions that others can undertake and
to avoid vague, abstract, or ambiguous phrasing. A cartoon depicts a man
who has fallen into a lake. As he struggles to swim, he shouts to his
dog on shore, “Lassie, get help!” In the next frame, the dog is lying on
a psychiatrist’s couch. We all know how opinions vary as to what
constitutes “help”: some members of my family, when asked to help with
the dishes, think “help” means supervision.</p>
<p>A couple in distress attending a workshop provides an additional
illustration of how nonspecific language can hamper understanding and
communication. “I want you to let me be me,” the woman declared to her
husband. “I do!” he retorted. “No, you don’t!” she insisted. Asked to
express herself in positive action language, the woman replied, “I want
you to give me the freedom to grow and be myself.” Such a statement,
however, is just as vague and likely to provoke a defensive response.
She struggled to formulate her request clearly, and then admitted, “It’s
kind of awkward, but if I were to be precise, I guess what I want is for
you to smile and say that anything I do is okay.” Often, the use of
vague and abstract language can mask oppressive interpersonal games.</p>
<p>Making requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals
what we really want.</p>
<p>A similar lack of clarity occurred between a father and his
fifteen-year-old son when they came in for counseling. “All I want is
for you to start showing a little responsibility,” claimed the father.
“Is that asking too much?” I suggested that he specify what it would
take for his son to demonstrate the responsibility he was seeking. After
a discussion on how to clarify his request, the father responded
sheepishly, “Well, it doesn’t sound so good, but when I say that I want
responsibility, what I really mean is that I want him to do what I ask,
without question—to jump when I say jump, and to smile while doing it.”
He then agreed with me that if his son were to actually behave this way,
it would demonstrate obedience rather than responsibility.</p>
<p>Like this father, we often use vague and abstract language to
indicate how we want other people to feel or be without naming a
concrete action they could take to reach that state. For example, an
employer makes a genuine effort to invite feedback, telling the
employees, “I want you to feel free to express yourself around me.” The
statement communicates the employer’s desire for the employees to “feel
free,” but not what they could do in order to feel this way. Instead,
the employer could use positive action language to make a request: “I’d
like you to tell me what I might do to make it easier for you to feel
free to express yourselves around me.”</p>
<p>Vague language contributes to internal confusion.</p>
<p>Depression is the reward we get for being “good.”</p>
<p>As a final illustration of how the use of vague language contributes
to internal confusion, I would like to present the conversation that I
would invariably have during my practice as a clinical psychologist with
the many clients who came to me with complaints of depression. After I
empathized with the depth of feeling that a client had just expressed,
our exchanges would typically proceed in the following manner:</p>
<p>MBR: What are you wanting that you are not receiving?</p>
<p>Client: I don’t know what I want.</p>
<p>MBR: I guessed that you would say that.</p>
<p>Client: Why?</p>
<p>MBR: My theory is that we get depressed because we’re not getting
what we want, and we’re not getting what we want because we have never
been taught to get what we want. Instead, we’ve been taught to be good
little boys and girls and good mothers and fathers. If we’re going to be
one of those good things, better get used to being depressed. Depression
is the reward we get for being “good.” But, if you want to feel better,
I’d like you to clarify what you would like people to do to make life
more wonderful for you.</p>
<p>Client: I just want someone to love me. That’s hardly unreasonable,
is it?</p>
<p>MBR: It’s a good start. Now I’d like you to clarify what you would
like people to do that would fulfill your need to be loved. For example,
what could I do right now?</p>
<p>Client: Oh, you know …</p>
<p>MBR: I’m not sure I do. I’d like you to tell me what you would like
me, or others, to do to give you the love you’re looking for.</p>
<p>Client: That’s hard.</p>
<p>MBR: Yes, it can be difficult to make clear requests. But think how
hard it will be for others to respond to our request if we’re not even
clear what it is!</p>
<p>Client: I’m starting to get clear what I want from others to fulfill
my need for love, but it’s embarrassing.</p>
<p>MBR: Yes, very often it is embarrassing. So what would you like for
me or others to do?</p>
<p>Client: If I really reflect upon what I’m requesting when I ask to be
loved, I suppose I want you to guess what I want before I’m even aware
of it. And then I want you to always do it.</p>
<p>MBR: I’m grateful for your clarity. I hope you can see how you are
not likely to find someone who can fulfill your need for love if that’s
what it takes.</p>
<p>Very often, my clients were able to see how the lack of awareness of
what they wanted from others had contributed significantly to their
frustrations and depression.</p>
<h5 id="making-requests-consciously">Making Requests Consciously</h5>
<p>Sometimes we may be able to communicate a clear request without
putting it in words. Suppose you’re in the kitchen and your sister, who
is watching television in the living room, calls out, “I’m thirsty.” In
this case, it may be obvious that she is requesting you to bring her a
glass of water from the kitchen.</p>
<p>However, in other instances, we may express our discomfort and
incorrectly assume that the listener has understood the underlying
request. For example, a woman might say to her husband, “I’m annoyed you
forgot the butter and onions I asked you to pick up for dinner.” While
it may be obvious to her that she is asking him to go back to the store,
the husband may think that her words were uttered solely to make him
feel guilty.</p>
<p>When we simply express our feelings, it may not be clear to the
listener what we want them to do.</p>
<p>Even more often, we are simply not conscious of what we are
requesting when we speak. We talk to others or at them without knowing
how to engage in a dialogue with them. We toss out words, using the
presence of others as a wastebasket. In such situations, the listener,
unable to discern a clear request in the speaker’s words, may experience
the kind of distress illustrated in the following anecdote.</p>
<p>We are often not conscious of what we are requesting.</p>
<p>I was seated directly across the aisle from a couple on a mini-train
that carries passengers to their respective terminals at the Dallas/Fort
Worth International Airport. For passengers in a hurry to catch a plane,
the snail’s pace of the train may well be irritating. The man turned to
his wife and said with intensity, “I have never seen a train go so slow
in all my life.” She said nothing, appearing tense and uneasy as to what
response he might be expecting from her. He then did what many of us do
when we’re not getting the response we want: he repeated himself. In a
markedly stronger voice, he exclaimed, “I have never seen a train go so
slow in all my life!”</p>
<p>The wife, at a loss for response, looked even more distressed. In
desperation, she turned to him and said, “They’re electronically timed.”
I didn’t think this piece of information would satisfy him, and indeed
it did not, for he repeated himself a third time—even more loudly, “I
HAVE NEVER SEEN A TRAIN GO SO SLOW IN ALL MY LIFE!” The wife’s patience
was clearly exhausted as she snapped back angrily, “Well, what do you
want me to do about it? Get out and push?” Now there were two people in
pain!</p>
<p>What response was the man wanting? I believe he wanted to hear that
his pain was understood. If his wife had known this, she might have
responded, “It sounds like you’re scared we might miss our plane, and
disgusted because you’d like a faster train running between these
terminals.”</p>
<p>Requests may sound like demands when unaccompanied by the speaker’s
feelings and needs.</p>
<p>In the above exchange, the wife heard the husband’s frustration but
was clueless as to what he was asking for. Equally problematic is the
reverse situation—when people state their requests without first
communicating the feelings and needs behind them. This is especially
true when the request takes the form of a question. “Why don’t you go
and get a haircut?” can easily be heard by youngsters as a demand or an
attack unless parents remember to first reveal their own feelings and
needs: “We’re worried that your hair is getting so long it might keep
you from seeing things, especially when you’re on your bike. How about a
haircut?”</p>
<p>It is more common, however, for people to talk without being
conscious of what they are asking for. “I’m not requesting anything,”
they might remark. “I just felt like saying what I said.” My belief is
that, whenever we say something to another person, we are requesting
something in return. It may simply be an empathic connection—a verbal or
nonverbal acknowledgment, as with the man on the train, that our words
have been understood. Or we may be requesting honesty: we wish to know
the listener’s honest reaction to our words. Or we may be requesting an
action that we hope would fulfill our needs. The clearer we are on what
we want back from the other person, the more likely it is that our needs
will be met.</p>
<p>The clearer we are about what we want, the more likely it is that
we’ll get it.</p>
<h5 id="asking-for-a-reflection">Asking for a Reflection</h5>
<p>As we know, the message we send is not always the message that’s
received. We generally rely on verbal cues to determine whether our
message has been understood to our satisfaction. If, however, we’re
uncertain that it has been received as intended, we need to be able to
clearly request a response that tells us how the message was heard so as
to be able to correct any misunderstanding. On some occasions, a simple
question like, “Is that clear?” will suffice. At other times, we need
more than “Yes, I understood you,” to feel confident that we’ve been
truly understood. At such times, we might ask others to reflect back in
their own words what they heard us say. We then have the opportunity to
restate parts of our message to address any discrepancy or omission we
might have noticed in their reflection.</p>
<p>To make sure the message we sent is the message that’s received, ask
the listener to reflect it back.</p>
<p>For example, a teacher approaches a student and says, “Peter, I got
concerned when I checked my record book yesterday. I want to make sure
you’re aware of the homework I’m missing from you. Will you drop by my
office after school?” Peter mumbles, “Okay, I know,” and then turns
away, leaving the teacher uneasy as to whether her message had been
accurately received. She asks for a reflection—“Could you tell me what
you just heard me say?”—to which Peter replies, “You said I gotta miss
soccer to stay after school because you didn’t like my homework.”
Confirmed in her suspicion that Peter had not heard her intended
message, the teacher tries to restate it, but first she is careful of
her next remark.</p>
<p>An assertion like “You didn’t hear me,” “That’s not what I said,” or
“You’re misunderstanding me,” may easily lead Peter to think that he is
being chastised. Since the teacher perceives Peter as having sincerely
responded to her request for a reflection, she might say, “I’m grateful
to you for telling me what you heard. I can see that I didn’t make
myself as clear as I’d have liked, so let me try again.”</p>
<p>Express appreciation when your listener tries to meet your request
for a reflection.</p>
<p>When we first begin asking others to reflect back what they hear us
say, it may feel awkward and strange because such requests are rarely
made. When I emphasize the importance of our ability to ask for
reflections, people often express reservations. They are worried about
reactions like, “What do you think I am—deaf?” or, “Quit playing your
psychological games.” To prevent such responses, we can explain to
people ahead of time why we may sometimes ask them to reflect back our
words. We make clear that we’re not testing their listening skills, but
checking out whether we’ve expressed ourselves clearly. However, should
the listener retort, “I heard what you said; I’m not stupid!” we have
the option to focus on the listener’s feelings and needs and ask—either
aloud or silently—“Are you saying you’re feeling annoyed because you
want respect for your ability to understand things?”</p>
<p>Empathize with the listener who doesn’t want to reflect back.</p>
<h5 id="requesting-honesty">Requesting Honesty</h5>
<p>After we’ve openly expressed ourselves and received the understanding
we want, we’re often eager to know the other person’s reaction to what
we’ve said. Usually the honesty we would like to receive takes one of
three directions:</p>
<p>Sometimes we’d like to know the feelings that are stimulated by what
we said, and the reasons for those feelings. We might request this by
asking, “I would like you to tell me how you feel about what I just
said, and your reasons for feeling as you do.”</p>
<p>After we express ourselves vulnerably, we often want to know (1) what
the listener is feeling;</p>
<p>Sometimes we’d like to know something about our listener’s thoughts
in response to what they just heard us say. At these times, it’s
important to specify which thoughts we’d like them to share. For
example, we might say, “I’d like you to tell me if you predict that my
proposal would be successful, and if not, what you believe would prevent
its success,” rather than simply saying, “I’d like you to tell me what
you think about what I’ve said.” When we don’t specify which thoughts we
would like to receive, the other person may respond at great length with
thoughts that aren’t the ones we are seeking.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>what the listener is thinking; or</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes we’d like to know whether the person is willing to take
certain actions that we’ve recommended. Such a request may sound like
this: “I’d like you to tell me if you would be willing to postpone our
meeting for one week.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>whether the listener would be willing to take a particular
action.</li>
</ol>
<p>The use of NVC requires that we be conscious of the specific form of
honesty we would like to receive, and to make that request for honesty
in concrete language.</p>
<h5 id="making-requests-of-a-group">Making Requests of a Group</h5>
<p>It is especially important when we are addressing a group to be clear
about the kind of understanding or honesty we want back after we’ve
expressed ourselves. When we are not clear about the response we’d like,
we may initiate unproductive conversations that end up satisfying no
one’s needs.</p>
<p>I’ve been invited from time to time to work with groups of citizens
concerned about racism in their communities. One issue that frequently
arises among these groups is that their meetings are tedious and
fruitless. This lack of productivity is very costly for group members,
who often expend limited resources to arrange for transportation and
child care in order to attend meetings. Frustrated by prolonged
discussions that yield little direction, many members quit the groups,
declaring meetings a waste of time. Furthermore, the institutional
changes they are striving to make are not usually ones that occur
quickly or easily. For all these reasons, when such groups do meet, it’s
important that they make good use of their time together.</p>
<p>I knew members of one such group that had been organized to effect
change in the local school system. It was their belief that various
elements in the school system discriminated against students on the
basis of race. Because their meetings were unproductive and the group
was losing members, they invited me to observe their discussions. I
suggested that they conduct their meeting as usual, and that I would let
them know if I saw any ways NVC might help.</p>
<p>One man began the meeting by calling the group’s attention to a
recent newspaper article in which a minority mother had raised
complaints and concerns regarding the principal’s treatment of her
daughter. A woman responded by sharing a situation that had occurred to
her when she was a student at the same school. One by one, each member
then related a similar personal experience. After twenty minutes I asked
the group if their needs were being met by the current discussion. Not
one person said yes. “This is what happens all the time in these
meetings!” huffed one man, “I have better things to do with my time than
sit around listening to the same old bullshit.”</p>
<p>I then addressed the man who had initiated the discussion: “Can you
tell me, when you brought up the newspaper article, what response you
were wanting from the group?”</p>
<p>“I thought it was interesting,” he replied. I explained that I was
asking what response he wanted from the group, rather than what he
thought about the article. He pondered awhile and then conceded, “I’m
not sure what I wanted.”</p>
<p>And that’s why, I believe, twenty minutes of the group’s valuable
time had been squandered on fruitless discourse. When we address a group
without being clear what we are wanting back, unproductive discussions
will often follow. However, if even one member of a group is conscious
of the importance of clearly requesting the response that is desired, he
or she can extend this consciousness to the group. For example, when
this particular speaker didn’t define what response he wanted, a member
of the group might have said, “I’m confused about how you’d like us to
respond to your story. Would you be willing to say what response you’d
like from us?” Such interventions can prevent the waste of precious
group time.</p>
<p>In a group, much time is wasted when speakers aren’t certain what
response they’re wanting.</p>
<p>Conversations often drag on and on, fulfilling no one’s needs,
because it is unclear whether the initiator of the conversation has
gotten what she or he wanted. In India, when people have received the
response they want in conversations they have initiated, they say “bas”
(pronounced “bus”). This means, “You need not say more. I feel satisfied
and am now ready to move on to something else.” Though we lack such a
word in our own language, we can benefit from developing and promoting
“bas-consciousness” in all our interactions.</p>
<h5 id="requests-versus-demands">Requests versus Demands</h5>
<p>Our requests are received as demands when others believe they will be
blamed or punished if they do not comply. When people hear a demand,
they see only two options: submission or rebellion. Either way, the
person requesting is perceived as coercive, and the listener’s capacity
to respond compassionately to the request is diminished.</p>
<p>When the other person hears a demand from us, they see two options:
to submit or to rebel.</p>
<p>The more we have in the past blamed, punished, or “laid guilt trips”
on others when they haven’t responded to our requests, the higher the
likelihood that our requests will now be heard as demands. We also pay
for others’ use of such tactics. To the degree that people in our lives
have been blamed, punished, or urged to feel guilty for not doing what
others have requested, the more likely they are to carry this baggage to
every subsequent relationship and hear a demand in any request.</p>
<p>To tell if it’s a demand or a request, observe what the speaker does
if the request is not complied with.</p>
<p>Let’s look at two variations of a situation. Jack says to his friend
Jane, “I’m lonely and would like you to spend the evening with me.” Is
that a request or a demand? The answer is that we don’t know until we
observe how Jack treats Jane if she doesn’t comply. Suppose she replies,
“Jack, I’m really tired. If you’d like some company, how about finding
someone else to be with you this evening?” If Jack then remarks, “How
typical of you to be so selfish!” his request was in fact a demand.
Instead of empathizing with her need to rest, he has blamed her.</p>
<p>It’s a demand if the speaker then criticizes or judges.</p>
<p>Consider a second scenario:</p>
<p>Jack: I’m lonely and would like you to spend the evening with me.</p>
<p>Jane: Jack, I’m really tired. If you’d like some company, how about
finding someone else to be with you tonight?</p>
<p>Jack: (turns away wordlessly)</p>
<p>Jane: (sensing he is upset) Is something bothering you?</p>
<p>Jack: No.</p>
<p>Jane: Come on, Jack, I can sense something’s going on. What’s the
matter?</p>
<p>Jack: You know how lonely I’m feeling. If you really loved me, you’d
spend the evening with me.</p>
<p>Again, instead of empathizing, Jack now interprets Jane’s response to
mean that she doesn’t love him and that she has rejected him. The more
we interpret noncompliance as rejection, the more likely our requests
will be heard as demands. This leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy, for
the more people hear demands, the less they enjoy being around us.</p>
<p>It’s a demand if the speaker then lays a guilt trip.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we would know that Jack’s request had been a
genuine request, not a demand, if his response to Jane had expressed a
respectful recognition of her feelings and needs. For example: “So,
Jane, you’re feeling worn out and needing some rest this evening?”</p>
<p>We can help others trust that we are requesting, not demanding, by
indicating that we would only want them to comply if they can do so
willingly. Thus we might ask, “Would you be willing to set the table?”
rather than “I would like you to set the table.” However, the most
powerful way to communicate that we are making a genuine request is to
empathize with people when they don’t agree to the request.</p>
<p>It’s a request if the speaker then shows empathy toward the other
person’s needs.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that we are making a request rather than a demand by
how we respond when others don’t comply. If we are prepared to show an
empathic understanding of what prevents someone from doing as we asked,
then by my definition, we have made a request, not a demand. Choosing to
request rather than demand does not mean we give up when someone says no
to our request. It does mean that we don’t engage in persuasion until we
have empathized with what’s preventing the other person from saying
yes.</p>
<h5 id="defining-our-objective-when-making-requests">Defining Our
Objective When Making Requests</h5>
<p>Expressing genuine requests also requires an awareness of our
objective. If our objective is only to change people and their behavior
or to get our way, then NVC is not an appropriate tool. The process is
designed for those of us who would like others to change and respond,
but only if they choose to do so willingly and compassionately. The
objective of NVC is to establish a relationship based on honesty and
empathy. When others trust that our primary commitment is to the quality
of the relationship, and that we expect this process to fulfill
everyone’s needs, then they can trust that our requests are true
requests and not camouflaged demands.</p>
<p>Our objective is a relationship based on honesty and empathy.</p>
<p>A consciousness of this objective is difficult to maintain,
especially for parents, teachers, managers, and others whose work
centers around influencing people and obtaining behavioral results. A
mother who once returned to a workshop after a lunch break announced,
“Marshall, I went home and tried it. It didn’t work.” I asked her to
describe what she’d done.</p>
<p>“I went home and expressed my feelings and needs, just as we’d
practiced. I made no criticism, no judgments of my son. I simply said,
‘Look, when I see that you haven’t done the work you said you were going
to do, I feel very disappointed. I wanted to be able to come home and
find the house in order and your chores completed.’ Then I made a
request: I told him I wanted him to clean it up immediately.”</p>
<p>“It sounds like you clearly expressed all the components,” I
commented. “What happened?”</p>
<p>“He didn’t do it.”</p>
<p>“Then what happened?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I told him he couldn’t go through life being lazy and
irresponsible.”</p>
<p>I could see that this woman was not yet able to distinguish between
expressing requests and making demands. She was still defining the
process as successful only if she got compliance for her “requests.”
During the initial phases of learning this process, we may find
ourselves applying the components of NVC mechanically without awareness
of the underlying purpose.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, even when we’re conscious of our intent and
express our request with care, people may still hear a demand. This is
particularly true when we occupy positions of authority and are speaking
with those who have had past experiences with coercive authority
figures.</p>
<p>Once, the administrator of a high school invited me to demonstrate to
teachers how NVC might help them communicate with students who weren’t
cooperating as the teachers would have liked.</p>
<p>I was asked to meet with forty students who had been deemed “socially
and emotionally maladjusted.” I was struck by the way such labels serve
as self-fulfilling prophecies. If you were a student who had been thus
labeled, wouldn’t it just give you permission to have some fun at school
by resisting whatever was asked of you? When we give people labels, we
tend to act in a way that contributes to the very behavior that concerns
us, which we then view as further confirmation of our diagnosis. Since
these students knew they had been classified as “socially and
emotionally maladjusted,” I wasn’t surprised that when I walked in, most
of them were hanging out the window hollering obscenities at their
friends in the courtyard below.</p>
<p>I began by making a request: “I’d like you all to come over and sit
down so I can tell you who I am and what I’d like us to do today.” About
half the students came over. Uncertain that they had all heard me, I
repeated my request. With that, the remainder of the students sat down,
with the exception of two young men who remained draped over the
windowsill. Unfortunately for me, these two were the biggest students in
the class.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” I addressed them, “would one of you two gentlemen tell
me what you heard me say?” One of them turned toward me and snorted,
“Yeah, you said we had to go over there and sit down.” I thought to
myself, “Uh, oh, he’s heard my request as a demand.”</p>
<p>Out loud I said, “Sir”—I’ve learned always to say “sir” to people
with biceps like his, especially when one of them sports a tattoo—“would
you be willing to tell me how I could have let you know what I was
wanting so that it wouldn’t sound like I was bossing you around?”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Having been conditioned to expect demands from authorities, he
was not used to my different approach. “How can I let you know what I’m
wanting from you so it doesn’t sound like I don’t care about what you’d
like?” I repeated. He hesitated for a moment and shrugged, “I don’t
know.”</p>
<p>“What’s going on between you and me right now is a good example of
what I was wanting us to talk about today. I believe people can enjoy
each other a lot better if they can say what they would like without
bossing others around. When I tell you what I’d like, I’m not saying
that you have to do it or I’ll try to make your life miserable. I don’t
know how to say that in a way that you can trust.” To my relief, this
seemed to make sense to the young man who, together with his friend,
sauntered over to join the group. In certain situations, such as this
one, it may take awhile for our requests to be clearly seen for what
they are.</p>
<p>When making a request, it is also helpful to scan our minds for the
sort of thoughts that automatically transform requests into demands:</p>
<p>He should be cleaning up after himself.</p>
<p>She’s supposed to do what I ask.</p>
<p>I deserve to get a raise.</p>
<p>I’m justified in having them stay later.</p>
<p>I have a right to more time off.</p>
<p>When we frame our needs with these thoughts, we are bound to judge
others when they don’t do as we request. I had these self-righteous
thoughts in my mind once when my younger son was not taking out the
garbage. When we were dividing the household chores, he had agreed to
this task, but every day we would have another struggle about getting
the garbage out. Every day I would remind him, “This is your job,” and
“We all have jobs”—with the sole objective of getting him to take out
the garbage.</p>
<p>Finally, one night I listened more closely to what he’d been telling
me all along about why the garbage wasn’t going out. I wrote the
following song after that evening’s discussion. After my son felt my
empathy for his position, he began taking out the garbage without any
further reminder from me.</p>
<p>If I clearly understand</p>
<p>you intend no demand,</p>
<p>I’ll usually respond when you call.</p>
<p>But if you come across</p>
<p>like a high and mighty boss,</p>
<p>you’ll feel like you ran into a wall.</p>
<p>And when you remind me</p>
<p>so piously</p>
<p>about all those things you’ve done for me,</p>
<p>you’d better get ready:</p>
<p>Here comes another bout!</p>
<p>Then you can shout,</p>
<p>you can spit,</p>
<p>moan, groan, and throw a fit;</p>
<p>I still won’t take the garbage out.</p>
<p>Now even if you should change your style,</p>
<p>It’s going to take me a little while</p>
<p>before I can forgive and forget.</p>
<p>Because it seems to me that you</p>
<p>didn’t see me as human too</p>
<p>until all your standards were met.</p>
<p>—“Song from Brett” by Marshall B. Rosenberg</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>The fourth component of NVC addresses the question of what we would
like to request of each other to enrich each of our lives. We try to
avoid vague, abstract, or ambiguous phrasing, and remember to use
positive action language by stating what we are requesting rather than
what we are not.</p>
<p>Each time we speak, the clearer we are about what we want back, the
more likely we are to get it. Since the message we send is not always
the message that’s received, we need to learn how to find out if our
message has been accurately heard. Especially when we are expressing
ourselves in a group, we need to be clear about the nature of the
response we are wanting. Otherwise we may be initiating unproductive
conversations that waste considerable group time.</p>
<p>Requests are received as demands when listeners believe that they
will be blamed or punished if they do not comply. We can help others
trust that we are requesting, not demanding, by indicating our desire
for them to comply only if they can do so willingly. The objective of
NVC is not to change people and their behavior in order to get our way;
it is to establish relationships based on honesty and empathy that will
eventually fulfill everyone’s needs.</p>
<p>NVC in Action</p>
<p>Sharing Fears About a Best Friend’s Smoking</p>
<p>Al and Burt have been best friends for over thirty years. Al, a
nonsmoker, has done everything he can over the years to persuade Burt to
give up his two-pack-a-day habit. In the past, when Al had tried to get
him to quit, Burt had often accused Al of judging him.</p>
<p>Aware during the past year of the increasing severity of his friend’s
hacking cough, Al finds himself bursting out one day with all the energy
and life that had been buried in his unexpressed anger and fear.</p>
<p>Al: Burt, I know we’ve talked about this a dozen times, but listen.
I’m scared your damned cigarettes are going to kill you! You’re my best
friend, and I want you around for as long as I can have you. Please
don’t think I’m judging you. I’m not—I’m just really worried.</p>
<p>Burt: No, I hear your concern. We’ve been friends for a long time
…</p>
<p>Al: (making a request) Would you be willing to quit?</p>
<p>Burt: I wish I could.</p>
<p>Al: (listening for the feelings and needs preventing Burt from
agreeing to the request) Are you scared to try because you don’t want to
fail?</p>
<p>Burt: Yeah … you know how many times I’ve tried before … I know
people think less of me for not being able to quit.</p>
<p>Al: (guessing at what Burt might want to request) I don’t think less
of you. And if you tried and failed again, I still wouldn’t. I just wish
you’d try.</p>
<p>Burt: Thanks. But you’re not the only one…. It’s everyone: you can
see it in their eyes—they think you’re a failure.</p>
<p>Al: (empathizing with Burt’s feeling) Is it kind of overwhelming to
worry about what others might think, when just quitting is hard
enough?</p>
<p>Burt: I really hate the idea that I might be addicted, that I have
something that I just can’t control …</p>
<p>Al: (Al’s eyes connect with Burt’s; he nods his head. Al’s interest
and attention to Burt’s deep feelings and needs are revealed through his
eyes and the silence that follows.)</p>
<p>Burt: I mean, I don’t even like smoking any more. It’s like you’re a
pariah if you do it in public. It’s embarrassing.</p>
<p>Al: (continuing to empathize) It sounds like you’d really like to
quit, but are scared you might fail—and how that would be for your
self-image and confidence.</p>
<p>Burt: Yeah, I guess that’s it…. You know, I don’t think I’ve ever
talked about it before. Usually when people tell me to quit, I just tell
them to get lost. I’d like to quit, but I don’t want all that pressure
from people.</p>
<p>Al: I wouldn’t want to pressure you. I don’t know if I could reassure
you about your fears around not succeeding, but I sure would like to
support you in any way I can. That is … if you want me to….</p>
<p>Burt: Yes, I do. I’m really touched by your concern and willingness.
But … suppose I’m not ready to try yet, is that okay with you too?</p>
<p>Al: Of course, Burt, I’ll still like you as much. It’s just that I
want to like you for longer!</p>
<p>Because Al’s request was a genuine request, not a demand, he
maintained awareness of his commitment to the quality of the
relationship, regardless of Burt’s response. He expressed this awareness
and his respect for Burt’s need for autonomy through his words, “I’ll
still like you,” while simultaneously expressing his own need “to like
you for longer.”</p>
<p>Burt: Well, then, maybe I will try again … but don’t tell anyone
else, okay?</p>
<p>Al: Sure, you decide when you’re ready; I won’t be mentioning it to
anybody.</p>
<p>Exercise 4</p>
<p>EXPRESSING REQUESTS</p>
<p>To see whether we’re in agreement about the clear expression of
requests, circle the number in front of each of the following statements
in which the speaker is clearly requesting that a specific action be
taken.</p>
<p>“I want you to understand me.”</p>
<p>“I’d like you to tell me one thing that I did that you
appreciate.”</p>
<p>“I’d like you to feel more confidence in yourself.”</p>
<p>“I want you to stop drinking.”</p>
<p>“I’d like you to let me be me.”</p>
<p>“I’d like you to be honest with me about yesterday’s meeting.”</p>
<p>“I would like you to drive at or below the speed limit.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to get to know you better.”</p>
<p>“I would like you to show respect for my privacy.”</p>
<p>“I’d like you to prepare supper more often.”</p>
<p>Here are my responses for Exercise 4:</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To me, the word
understand does not clearly express a request for a specific action. A
request for a specific action might be: “I want you to tell me what you
heard me say.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that the speaker is
clearly requesting a specific action.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To me, the words
feel more confidence do not clearly express a request for a specific
action. A request for a specific action might be: “I’d like you to take
a course in assertiveness training, which I believe would increase your
self-confidence.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To me, the words
stop drinking do not express what the speaker wants, but rather what he
or she doesn’t want. A request for a specific action might be: “I want
you to tell me what needs of yours are met by drinking, and to discuss
with me other ways of meeting those needs.”</li>
</ol>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To me, the words
let me be me do not clearly express a request for a specific action. A
request for a specific action might be: “I want you to tell me you won’t
leave our relationship—even if I do some things that you don’t
like.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To me, the words
be honest with me do not clearly express a request for a specific
action. A request for a specific action might be: “I want you to tell me
how you feel about what I did and what you’d like me to do
differently.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re in agreement that the speaker is
clearly requesting a specific action.</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To me, the words
get to know you better do not clearly express a request for a specific
action. A request for a specific action might be: “I’d like you to tell
me if you would be willing to meet for lunch once a week.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To me, the words
show respect for my privacy do not clearly express a request for a
specific action. A request for a specific action might be: “I’d like you
to agree to knock before you enter my office.”</p>
<p>If you circled this number, we’re not in agreement. To me, the words
more often do not clearly express a request for a specific action. A
request for a specific action might be: “I’d like you to prepare supper
every Monday night.”</p>
