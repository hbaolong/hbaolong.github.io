<p>The GitHub Book</p>
<p>Chris Dawson</p>
<p>Ben Straub</p>
<p>Beijing • Cambridge • Farnham • Köln • Sebastopol • Tokyo</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>In the 1930s, The Eagle and Child, a pub in Oxford simmered with
creativity as JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis philosophized and created their
fantasy worlds. Heian court life in 11th century Kyoto cradled Murasaki
Shibu and produced The Tale of Genji, Japan’s greatest novel. In the 7th
century during the Umayyad Caliphate of modern day Damascus, glittering
Arabic palaces provided fertile ground for the creation of a new form of
poetry, the ghazal (“love poems”) the influence of which still courses
through modern Arabic poetry.</p>
<p>Each era of major creative innovation has been backdropped by a
unique and plumb space where collaboration and creativity flourished.
Today, the collaborative gathering space for some of the world’s
greatest artists (artists who work as software developers) is a virtual
town square, a site called GitHub.</p>
<p>Who You Are</p>
<p>This book should be an interesting source of information for people
who have used Git or GitHub and want to “level-up” their skills related
to these technologies. People without any experience using GitHub or Git
should start with an introductory book on these technologies.</p>
<p>You should have a good familiarity with at least one imperative
modern programming language. You don’t need to be an expert programmer
to read this book, but having some programming experience and
familiarity with at least one language is essential.</p>
<p>You should understand the basics of the HTTP protocol. The GitHub
team uses a very standard RESTful approach for its API. You should
understand the difference between a GET request and POST request and
what HTTP status codes mean at the very least.</p>
<p>Familiariy with web APIs is helpful, although this book
simultaneously aspires to provide a guide showing how a well thought
out, well designed, and well tested web API creates a foundation for
building fun and powerful tools. If you have not used web APIs
extensively, but have experience using other types of APIs, this is good
company.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn</p>
<p>Much of the book focuses on the technical capabilities exposed by
GitHub and the powerful GitHub API. Perhaps you feel constrained by
using Git only from within a certain toolset; for example, if you are an
Android developer accidentally using Git to manage your app source code
and want to unlock Git in other places in your life as a developer, this
book provides a wider vista to learn about the power of Git and GitHub.
If you have fallen into using Git for your own projects and are now
interested in using Git within a larger community, this book can teach
you all about the “social coding” style pioneered and dogfooded by the
GitHub team. This book provides a stepping stone for software developers
who have used other distributed version control systems and are looking
for a bridge to using their skills with Git and within a web service
like GitHub.</p>
<p>Like any seasoned developer, automation of your tools is important to
you, and this book provides examples of mundane tasks that we then
convert them into automated and repeatable processes, and we show how to
do this using a variety of languages talking to the GitHub API.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with the “command line” this book will give you
a firm understanding of how to use it, and we bet you will find great
power there. To make this book accessible to everyone, regardless of
their editor or operating system, many of the programming samples work
within the command line. If you have hated the command line since your
father forced you to use it when you were five, this is the perfect book
to rekindle a loving relationship with the bash shell.</p>
<p>If you absorb not only the technical facets of using GitHub but also
pay attention to the cultural and ideological changes offered behind the
tools, you’ll very likely see a new way of working in the modern age. We
focus on these “meta” viewpoints as we discuss the tools themselves to
help you see these extra opportunities.</p>
<p>Almost every chapter has an associated repository hosted on GitHub
where you can review the code discussed. Fork away and take these
samples into your own projects and tools!</p>
<p>Finally, we help you write testable API backed code. Even the most
experienced developers often find that writing tests for their code is a
challenge, despite the massive body of literature connecting quality
code with tests. Testing can be especially challenging when you are
testing something backed by an API; it requires a different level of
thinking than is found in strict unit testing. To help you get past this
roadblock, whenever possible, this book shows you how to write code
which interacts with the GitHub API and is testable.</p>
<p>First Class Languages You Need to Know</p>
<p>There are two languages which are so fundamentally linked to GitHub
that you do need to install and use them in order to get the most out of
this book.</p>
<p>Ruby: a simple, readable programming language used heavily by the
founders of GitHub.</p>
<p>JavaScript: the only ubiquitous browser side programming language,
its importance has grown to new heights with the introduction of NodeJS,
rivaling even the popularity of Ruby on Rails as a server side toolkit
for web applications, especially for independent developers.</p>
<p>Your time will not be wasted if you install and play with these two
tools. Between them you will have a solid toolset to begin exploration
of the GitHub API. Several chapters in this book use Ruby or JavaScript,
so putting in some time to learn at least a little bit will make the
journey through this book richer for you.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, many of you picking up this book already have
familiarity with Ruby or JavaScript/NodeJS. So, the basics and
installation of them are in appendices in the back of the book. The
appendices don’t cover syntax of these languages; we expect you have
experience with other languages as a prerequisite and can read code from
any imperative language regardless of the syntax. Later chapters which
do discuss a facet of the API go into language details at times, and the
code is readable regardless of your familiarity with that particular
language. These explanatory appendices discuss the history of these
tools within the GitHub story as well as important usage notes like
special files and installation options.</p>
<p>Who This Book is Not For</p>
<p>If you are looking for a discussion of the GitHub API that focuses on
a single language, you will be disappointed to find that we look at the
API through many different languages. We do this to describe the API
from not only the way the GitHub team designed it to work, but the
aspirational way that client library authors made it work within diverse
programming languages and communities. We think there is a lot to learn
from this approach, but if you are interested in only a specific
language and how it works with the GitHub API, this is not the book for
you.</p>
<p>Conventions Used in This Book</p>
<p>The following typographical conventions are used in this book:</p>
<p>Italic</p>
<p>Indicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, and file
extensions.</p>
<p>Constant width</p>
<p>Used for program listings, as well as within paragraphs to refer to
program elements such as variable or function names, databases, data
types, environment variables, statements, and keywords.</p>
<p>Constant width bold</p>
<p>Shows commands or other text that should be typed literally by the
user.</p>
<p>Constant width italic</p>
<p>Shows text that should be replaced with user-supplied values or by

writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does
not require permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples
from O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering a question by
citing this book and quoting example code does not require permission.
Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book into
your product’s documentation does require permission.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments</p>
<p>Chris wants to thank his lovely wife, Nicole. I hope that I have
added to this book even a tiny bit of the wit and wisdom you provide to
me and our family every day. My son Roosevelt’s energy continues to
inspire me and keep me going even when I am at my limits. To my daughter
Charlotte, you are my little smiling Buddha. To my mother, who showed me
how to write and, most importantly, why to write, which is something we
need more of in the technology world. To Tim O’Brien who invited me into
this project, thank you, and I hope we can collaborate again.</p>
<p>Ben would like to thank his wife, Becky, for her ongoing support and
(when needed) push from behind. None of this would have happened without
you.</p>
