<h4 id="chapter-4.-python-and-the-search-api">Chapter 4. Python and the
Search API</h4>
<p>Once you have enough data, no amount of organization will make
everything easy to find. As Google has taught us, the only system that
works at this scale is a search box. When you use GitHub, you’re exposed
to both sides of this phenomenon: the repositories you have direct
access to—which are relatively small in number—are given a single level
of hierarchy, so you can keep them straight in your head. For the rest,
the uncountable millions of public repositories that belong to other
people, there’s a search box, with powerful features to help you find
what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>Helpfully, GitHub also exposes this capability as an API you can
consume from your own applications. GitHub’s search API gives you access
to the full power of the built-in search function. This includes the use
of logical and scoping operators, like or and user. By integrating this
feature with your application, you can provide your users a very
powerful way of finding what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>In this chapter we’ll take a close look at this API, and try building
something with it. We’ll see how the search API is structured, what kind
of results come back, and how it can help us create a feature for
someone on our team.</p>
<p>General Principles</p>
<p>The search API is split into four separate parts:</p>
<p>Repositories</p>
<p>Code</p>
<p>Issues</p>
<p>Users</p>
<p>These APIs all have separate subject matter, and have different
formats for their results, but they all behave the same in a few key
ways. We’re covering these first, because they’ll help you understand
the results coming back from the specific API calls that we cover
further down. There are four major areas of commonality.</p>
<p>Authentication</p>
<p>Your identity as a user can determine the result set from a search
query, so it’s important to know about authentication. We cover GitHub
authentication fully in Authentication, but this API is also available
without logging in. However, there are a few limitations to this
approach.</p>
<p>First, you’ll only be able to search public repositories. This is
probably fine if you’re primarily working with open-source software, but
users of your application will probably expect to have access to their
private code, as well as that of any organizations they belong to. Also,
since all Enterprise repositories are private, anonymous search is
completely useless there.</p>
<p>Secondly, authenticating opens up your rate limit. The limits on
search are stricter than other APIs anyways, because search is
computationally expensive, but anonymous searches are stricter still. As
of this writing, and according to the documentation, anonymous searches
are limited to 5 per minute, and you can do 20 authenticated queries per
minute. Take a look at GitHub API Rate Limits for more on how to work
with rate limits.</p>
<p>Result Format</p>
<p>No matter what you’re searching for, the return value from the API
follows a certain format. Here’s a sample result from a query, which has
been heavily edited to focus only on the parts you’ll always see:</p>
<p>{ “total_count“: 824, “incomplete_results“: false, “items“: 〔 { …
“score“: 3.357718 } 〕 }</p>
<p>Starting from the top: the total_count field represents the total
number of search results that turned up from this query. It’s not
uncommon for a fairly specific search to turn up thousands of results –
remember, there are millions of repositories on GitHub. By default, only
the first 30 are returned, but you can customize this with page and
per_page query parameters in the url. For example, a GET request to
search/repositories?q=foobarandandandandpage=2andandandandpage_size=45
will return 45 items, starting with the 46th result. Page sizes are
generally limited to 100.</p>
<p>The incomplete_results field refers to a computational limit placed
on the search API. If your search takes too long, the GitHub API will
stop it partway through executing, return the results that did complete,
and set this flag to true. For most queries this won’t be a problem, and
the total_count will represent all the results from the search, but if
your query is complicated, you might only get a partial result set.</p>
<p>Search results are returned in the items array, and each item always
has a score field. This field is numeric, but it’s only a relative
measure of how well a result matches the query, and is used for the
default sort order – highest score first. If you do pay attention to it,
remember it only has meaning when compared to other results from the
same query.</p>
<p>Search Operators and Qualifiers</p>
<p>Of course, it’s always better if you can avoid pagination altogether,
or at least get the best results in the first page. Qualifiers and
operators can help narrow your search results to fewer pages, hopefully
allowing the right result to float to the top.</p>
<p>All searches are done through a search query, which is encoded and
passed in the URL as the q parameter. Most of the query will be free
text, but the API also supports some powerful syntax, such as these
forms:</p>
<p>x AND y, as well as OR and NOT</p>
<p>user:<name>, where name is a user or organization</p>
<p>repo:<name></p>
<p>language:<name></p>
<p>created:&lt;date(s)&gt;</p>
<p>extension:<pattern> matches file extensions (like “py” or “ini”)</p>
<p>Numerical values and dates can have ranges:</p>
<p>2015-02-01 will match only the given date</p>
<p>&lt;2015-02-01 will match any date previous to the one given</p>
<p>2015-02-01..2015-03-01 will match dates within the given range,
including the end points</p>
<p>There are many other options besides. Check out
https://github.com/search/advanced for a UI that can help you construct
a query.</p>
<p>Sorting</p>
<p>If search query operators can’t narrow down a result set to just the
most important items, perhaps sorting them can. Search results are
returned in a definite order, never at random. The default order is
“best match,” which sorts your results based on their search score, best
score first. If you want to override this, you can pass stars, forks, or
updated in the sort query parameter, as in
search/repositories?q=foobarandandandandsort=stars.</p>
<p>You can also reverse the sort order using the order parameter, like
search/repositories?q=foobarandandandandsort=starsandandandandorder=desc.
The default is desc (“descending”), but asc is also accepted, and will
reverse the order.</p>
<p>Search APIs in Detail</p>
<p>Now that we’ve covered how all these APIs behave the same, let’s
discuss their specifics. The search API is compartmentalized into four
categories: repositories, code, issues, and users. The basic mechanism
is the same for all four: send a GET request to the endpoint, and
provide a URL-encoded search term as the q parameter. We’ll show an
abridged response from each of the four, along with some discussion of
what to expect.</p>
<p>Repository Search</p>
<p>The search/repositories endpoint looks in the repository metadata to
match your query. This includes the project’s name and description by
default, though you can also search the README file by specifying
in:readme in the query. Other qualifiers are documented at
https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-repositories.</p>
<p>Its response looks something like this:</p>
<p>{ “total_count“: 824, “incomplete_results“: false, “items“: 〔 {
“id“: 10869370, “name“: “foobar“, “full_name“: “iwhitcomb/foobar“,
“owner“: { “login“: “iwhitcomb“, “id“: 887528, “avatar_url“:
“https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/887528?v=3“, … }, “private“:
false, “html_url“: “https://github.com/iwhitcomb/foobar“, “description“:
“Drupal 8 Module Example“, “fork“: false, … “score“: 59.32314 }, … 〕
}</p>
<p>Each item in items looks a lot like the result of a query to the
repositories API. All sorts of useful information is included, such as a
URL to the UI for this repository (html_url), the owner’s avatar
(owner.avatar_url), and a URL suitable for cloning the repository using
Git (git_url).</p>
<p>Code Search</p>
<p>The search/code endpoint is for searching the contents of a
repository. You can try matching the contents of the files themselves,
or their paths (using in:path). (For complete documentation on the other
available qualifiers, check out
https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-code.)</p>
<p>This API is subject to several limits that don’t affect the other
search endpoints, because of the sheer amount of data the server must
sort through to find matches. First, it requires that you provide a
free-text search term; specifying a query with only operators (like
language:python) is valid with other APIs, but not here. Second, any
wildcard characters in the query will be ignored. Third, files above a
certain size will not be searched. Fourth, it only searches the default
branch of any given project, which is usually master. Fifth, and
possibly most importantly, you must specify a repository owner using the
user:<name> qualifier; you cannot search all repositories with one
query.</p>
<p>The JSON returned looks something like this:</p>
<p>{ “total_count“: 9246, “incomplete_results“: false, “items“: 〔 {
“name“: “migrated_0000.js“, “path“:
“test/fixtures/ES6/class/migrated_0000.js“, “sha“:
“37bdd2221a71b58576da9d3c2dc0ef0998263652“, “url“: “…“, “git_url“: “…“,
“html_url“: “…“, “repository“: { “id“: 2833537, “name“: “esprima“,
“full_name“: “jquery/esprima“, “owner“: { “login“: “jquery“, “id“:
70142, “avatar_url“:
“https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70142?v=3“, … }, “private“:
false, … }, “score“: 2.3529532 }, … 〕 }</p>
<p>Each item has some data about the file that turned up, including its
name and URLs for a couple of representations of it. Then there’s the
blob of data about its repository, followed by a score, which is used
for the default “best match” sorting.</p>
<p>Issue Search</p>
<p>Repositories contain more than just code. The search/issues endpoint
looks for matches in the issues and pull requests attached to a project.
This endpoint responds to a wide variety of search qualifiers, such
as:</p>
<p>type – either “pr” for pull requests, or “issue” for issues (the
default is both)</p>
<p>team - match issues whose discussions mention a specific team (only
works for organizations you belong to)</p>
<p>no - match issues that are missing a piece of data (as in
“no:label”)</p>
<p>There are many more; see
https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-issues for complete
documentation.</p>
<p>The result of a call to this endpoint looks like this:</p>
<p>{ “total_count“: 1278397, “incomplete_results“: false, “items“: 〔 {
“url“: “…“, “labels_url“: “…“, “comments_url“: “…“, “events_url“: “…“,
“html_url“: “…“, “id“: 69671218, “number“: 1, “title“: “Classes“,
“user“: { “login“: “reubeningber“, “id“: 2552792, “avatar_url“: “…“, …
}, “labels“: 〔 … 〕, “state“: “open“, “locked“: false, “assignee“:
null, “milestone“: null, “comments“: 0, “created_at“:
“2015-04-20T20:18:56Z“, “updated_at“: “2015-04-20T20:18:56Z“,
“closed_at“: null, “body“: “There should be an option to add classes to
the ul and li being generated. “, “score“: 22.575937 }, 〕 }</p>
<p>Again, each item in the list looks like the result of a call to the
issues API. There are a lot of useful bits of data here, such as the
issue’s title (title), labels (labels), and links to information about
the pull-request data (pull_request.url), which won’t be present if the
result isn’t a pull request.</p>
<p>User Search</p>
<p>All the other search APIs are centered around repositories, but this
endpoint searches a different namespace: GitHub users. By default, only
a user’s login name and public email address are searched; the in
qualifier can extend this to include the user’s full name as well, with
in:fullname,login,email. There are several other useful qualifiers
available; see https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-users for
complete documentation.</p>
<p>Querying the search/users endpoint gives you this kind of
response:</p>
<p>{ “total_count“: 26873, “incomplete_results“: false, “items“: 〔 {
“login“: “ben“, “id“: 39902, “avatar_url“: “…“, “gravatar_id“: ““,
“url“: “…“, “html_url“: “…“, … “score“: 98.24275 }, { “login“:
“bengottlieb“, “id“: 53162, “avatar_url“: “…“, “gravatar_id“: ““, “url“:
“…“, “html_url“: “…“, … “score“: 35.834213 }, 〕 }</p>
<p>The list of items in this case look like the results from a query of
the users/<name> endpoint. Useful items here are the user’s avatar
(avatar_url), several links to other API endpoints (repos_url, url), and
the type of result (user or organization, in type).</p>
<p>Our example application</p>
<p>Now that we know a bit about how this API behaves, let’s do something
useful with it.</p>
<p>Imagine your development team uses GitHub to store their Git
repositories, and that there are lots of little repositories for parts
of the application that work together at runtime. This kind of situation
ends up being fairly difficult to work with for your non-technical
colleagues; if they want to report an issue, they don’t know where to
go, and they don’t know how to find issues that already exist.</p>
<p>Search can make this possible, but doing a search across an entire
organization’s repositories involves using the user:<organization>
operator, which is obtusely named, and kind of scary for
non-programmers.</p>
<p>The Search API can make this a bit easier. Let’s make a GUI
application with just a single search box, which makes it dead simple
for a non-technical user to search all the issues in all the
repositories in a single organization. It’ll end up looking a bit like
Figure 4-1.</p>
<p>Figure 4-1. GitHub search application</p>
<p>User flow</p>
<p>That’s the overall goal, but let’s dig in to more detail about how
the user experiences the application.</p>
<p>The first thing we’ll do is require the user to log in with GitHub
credentials. Why? Partly because the search API is throttled pretty
aggressively, and the rate limits are higher with authenticated access.
But also because our user is going to need the ability to search issues
in private repositories. To make this easier, our program will try to
get GitHub credentials from Git’s credential store, but it’ll fall back
to a login form, which looks like Figure 4-2.</p>
<p>Figure 4-2. Login UI</p>
<p>Once the user logs in, they’ll be shown a search box. Typing in a
search query and hitting enter will result in a scrollable list of
search results, with titles and the first line of the description.
Clicking on a search result opens the issue in the user’s browser.</p>
<p>That’s about it. This application only has two main screens from the
user’s point of view. It’s a simple, focused tool to solve a very
tightly-defined problem, so the code shouldn’t be too hard.</p>
<p>Python</p>
<p>Now that we know how the program should act, let’s decide how it
should work.</p>
<p>We’ll use Python for our implementation language, for several
reasons. First, because we haven’t yet seen it in this book, and we like
to expose you to a wide variety of languages. One of our goals is to
help the reader explore technologies they might not have seen
before.</p>
<p>Secondly, there’s a library for building GUI applications that run
without modification on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows. Surprisingly, this
is fairly unique feature among modern high-level programming languages.
If you want this capability elsewhere, you usually have to use a
high-complexity framework, a lower-level language like C++, or both.</p>
<p>Thirdly, this will help make it easy to distribute. Python has a
package available which There exists a Python package which bundles an
entire Python program and all of its dependencies into a single file (or
.app bundle on OS X). So giving this program to a colleague is as easy
as emailing her a ZIP file.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at the libraries we’ll be using in our
application’s code. We’ll see them in action later on, but a quick
overview will help you understand what each one is trying to do. As is
unfortunately typical with Python development, installation methods vary
from package to package, so we’ll also tell you how to get each one onto
your machine.</p>
<p>AGitHub</p>
<p>The first thing we should mention is the library we’ll use to talk to
the GitHub API, which is called agithub. agithub implements is a very
thin layer that converts GitHub’s REST API into method calls on objects,
resulting in delightfully readable code.</p>
<p>agithub can be found at https://github.com/jpaugh/agithub, and the
“installation” is simply to download a copy of the agithub.py source
file and place it alongside your project files.</p>
<p>WxPython</p>
<p>WxPython is how we’ll create the graphical interface for our
application. It’s an object-oriented Python layer over the top of a
toolkit called WxWidgets, which is itself a common-code adapter for
native UI toolkits. WxWidgets supports Linux, Mac, and Windows operating
systems with native controls, so you can access all of those platforms
with the same Python code.</p>
<p>Information about the WxPython project can be found at
http://www.wxpython.org, and you’ll find a download link for your
platform on the left-hand side of the page. The next version of WxPython
(code-named “Phoenix”), will be installable via PIP, but as of this
writing Phoenix is still pre-release software, so it’s probably safer to
use the stable version.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>WxPython is the reason we use Python 2.7 for this example. Support
for Python 3 is planned for the upcoming Phoenix release, but as of this
writing, the stable versions are Python 2 only. Most of the code below
is written in a “polyglot” fashion, so you shouldn’t run into any
trouble running it under Python 3 if Phoenix has arrived by the time you
read this.</p>
<p>PyInstaller</p>
<p>PyInstaller will be our distribution tool. Its main function is to
read your Python code, analyze it to discover all its dependencies, then
collect all these files (including the Python interpreter) and put them
in one directory. It can even wrap all of that up in a single package
that, when double-clicked, runs your program. It does all this without
needing much input from you, and there are only a few configuration
options. If you’ve written GUI applications before, you’ll know how hard
each of these problems are.</p>
<p>For information on this project, you can visit
http://pythonhosted.org/PyInstaller. You can install it using Python’s
package manager, by running pip install pyinstaller.</p>
<p>The Code</p>
<p>Alright, now you have an idea of which parts of the Python ecosystem
will be helping us on our journey. Let’s get started looking at the code
that brings them all together. We’ll start with this skeleton file:</p>
<p>#!/usr/bin/env python # import os, subprocess import wx from agithub
import Github # class SearchFrame(wx.Frame): # pass if
<strong>name</strong> == ‘<strong>main</strong>’: # app = wx.App()
SearchFrame(None) app.MainLoop()</p>
<p>If you run this program, you should get an empty window, which is
always a hopeful start to any project. Let’s take a look at a few key
things:</p>
<p>The “shebang” specifies that this is a Python 2.7 program</p>
<p>Here we import our handy libraries. We import WxPython (wx) whole
cloth, but with agithub we only need the Github (note the
capitalization) class. os and subprocess come from the Python standard
library.</p>
<p>This is the class for our main window. We’ll walk through the
particulars later on when we discuss the real implementation.</p>
<p>In Python, you create the main entry point of an application using
this syntax.</p>
<p>And this is how you write a “main” function in WxPython. We
instantiate an App instance, create an instance of our top-level frame,
and run the app’s main loop.</p>
<p>Git credential helper</p>
<p>That’s how most of the UI code is going to be structured, but before
we go any further, we should define a function to help us get the user’s
GitHub credentials. We’ll be cheating a bit, by asking Git if it has the
user’s login and password.</p>
<p>We’ll leverage the git credential fill command. This is used
internally by Git to avoid having to ask the user for their GitHub
password every time they interact with a GitHub remote. The way it works
is by accepting all the known facts about a connection through stdin, as
text lines in the format “<key>=<value>”. Once the caller has supplied
all the facts it knows, it can close the stdin stream (or supply an
empty line), and Git will respond with all the facts it knows about this
connection. With any luck, this will include the user’s login and
password. The whole interaction looks a bit like this:</p>
<p>$ echo “host=github.com“ | git credential fill host=github.com
username=ben password=(redacted)</p>
<p>This passes a single line to git credential and closes stdin, which
Git will recognize as the end of input.</p>
<p>Git responds with all the facts it knows about the connection. This
includes the input values, as well as the username and password if Git
knows them.</p>
<p>One other thing that you should know about git-credential is that by
default, if it doesn’t know anything about the host, it’ll ask the user
at the terminal. That’s bad for a GUI app, so we’re going to be
disabling that feature through the use of the GIT_ASKPASS environment
variable.</p>
<p>Here’s what our helper looks like:</p>
<p>GITHUB_HOST = ‘github.com’ def git_credentials():
os.environ〔‘GIT_ASKPASS’〕 = ‘true’ p = subprocess.Popen(〔‘git’,
‘credential’, ‘fill’〕, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE)
stdout,_ = p.communicate(’host={}</p>
<p>‘.format(GITHUB_HOST)) creds = {} for line in stdout.split(’</p>
<p>‘)〔:-1〕: k,v = line.split(’=’) creds〔k〕 = v return creds</p>
<p>Here we set GIT_ASKPASS to the string ‘true’, which is a UNIX program
that always returns 0, which will cause git-credential to stop trying to
get credentials when it gets to the “as the user” stage.</p>
<p>subprocess.Popen is the way you use a program with stdin and stdout
in Python. The first argument is the argv of the new program, and we
also specify that we want stdin and stdout to be captured.</p>
<p>p.communicate does the work of writing to stdin and returning the
contents of stdout. It also returns the contents of stderr, which we
ignore in this program.</p>
<p>Here we process the stdout contents by splitting each line at the =
character, and slurping it into a dictionary.</p>
<p>So the return value from this call should be a dictionary with
‘username’ and ‘password’ values. Handy!</p>
<p>Windowing and interface</p>
<p>Okay, so now we have something that can help us skip a login screen,
but we don’t have a way of showing that login screen to the user. Let’s
get closer to that goal by filling in the main frame’s
implementation:</p>
<p>class SearchFrame(wx.Frame): def <strong>init</strong>(self, *args,
**kwargs): kwargs.setdefault(‘size’, (600,500)) wx.Frame.__init__(self,
*args, **kwargs) self.credentials = {} self.orgs = 〔〕
self.create_controls() self.do_layout() # Try to pre-load credentials
from Git’s cache self.credentials = git_credentials() if
self.test_credentials(): self.switch_to_search_panel()
self.SetTitle(‘GitHub Issue Search’) self.Show()</p>
<p>The <strong>init</strong> method is the constructor, so this is where
we start when the main function calls SearchFrame(). Here’s what’s
happening at a high level – we’ll dig into the details in a bit:</p>
<p>Set up some layout dimensions and pass to the parent class’s
constructor</p>
<p>Create the UI controls</p>
<p>Retrieve the credentials from the user using the credential helper we
described earlier</p>
<p>Change the title and display the application to the user</p>
<p>Before we get to how all those things are done, let’s step back a bit
and talk about this class’s job. It’s responsible for maintaining the
top-level “frame” (a window with a title bar, a menu, and so on), and
deciding what’s displayed in that frame. In this case, we want to show a
login UI first, and when we get valid credentials (either from Git or
the user), we’ll switch to a searching UI.</p>
<p>Alright, enough background. Let’s walk through the code for getting
and checking credentials.</p>
<p>def login_accepted(self, username, password):
self.credentials〔‘username’〕 = username self.credentials〔‘password’〕
= password if self.test_credentials(): self.switch_to_search_panel() def
test_credentials(self): if any(k not in self.credentials for k in
〔‘username’, ‘password’〕): return False g =
Github(self.credentials〔‘username’〕, self.credentials〔‘password’〕)
status,data = g.user.orgs.get() if status != 200: print(‘bad credentials
in store’) return False self.orgs = 〔o〔‘login’〕 for o in data〕
return True def switch_to_search_panel(self): self.login_panel.Destroy()
self.search_panel = SearchPanel(self, orgs=self.orgs,
credentials=self.credentials) self.sizer.Add(self.search_panel, 1,
flag=wx.EXPAND | wx.ALL, border=10) self.sizer.Layout()</p>
<p>Each of these three methods comes in at a different point during our
program’s execution. If our credentials are coming from Git, we proceed
straight to test_credentials; if they’re coming from the login panel
(see below), they go through the login_accepted callback first, which
then calls test_credentials.</p>
<p>Either way, what we do is try to fetch a list of the user’s
organizations, to see if they work. Here you can see the usage pattern
for agithub – the URL path is mapped to object-property notation on an
instance of the Github class, and the HTTP verb is mapped to a method
call. The return values are a status code and the data, which has been
decoded into a dictionary object. If it fails — meaning the returned
status is not 200 — we send the user to the login panel. If it succeeds,
we call switch_to_search_panel.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>We’re doing a synchronous network call on the UI thread. This is
usually a bad idea, because the UI will become unresponsive until the
network call completes. Ideally we’d move this out onto another thread,
and get the return value with a message, but for this simple example
(and use case), it’ll do.</p>
<p>The last method handles the UI switch. The login panel is referenced
by two things: the SearchFrame instance (the parent window), and the
sizer that’s controlling its layout. Fortunately, calling the Destroy()
method cleans both of those up, so we can then create the SearchPanel
instance and add it to our sizer. Doing this requires a specific call to
the sizer’s Layout() method; otherwise the sizer won’t know that it
needs to adjust the position and size of the new panel.</p>
<p>def create_controls(self): # Set up a menu. This is mainly for
“Cmd-Q“ behavior on OSX filemenu = wx.Menu() filemenu.Append(wx.ID_EXIT,
‘andandandandExit’) menuBar = wx.MenuBar() menuBar.Append(filemenu,
‘andandandandFile’) self.SetMenuBar(menuBar) # Start with a login UI
self.login_panel = LoginPanel(self, onlogin=self.login_accepted) def
do_layout(self): self.sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)
self.sizer.Add(self.login_panel, 1, flag=wx.EXPAND | wx.ALL, border=10)
self.SetSizer(self.sizer)</p>
<p>create_controls is fairly straightforward. It instantiates a menu
that only contains File&gt;Exit, and a login panel, whose implementation
we’ll cover a bit later on. Note that when we create a visible control,
we pass self as the first parameter to the constructor. That’s because
the SearchFrame instance we’re constructing is the parent window of that
control.</p>
<p>do_layout uses a WxWidgets feature called “sizers” to do some
automated layout. Sizers are a complex topic, but here’s all you need to
know about this snippet:</p>
<p>A BoxSizer stacks widgets in a single direction, in this case
vertically.</p>
<p>The second parameter to sizer.Add is a scaling factor. If it’s zero,
the widget you’re adding will always stay the same size if the parent
window resizes; if it’s anything else, all the things the sizer is
controlling will adjust to fill their container. There’s only one
control in this sizer, but we still want it to take up the full area of
the window, so we pass 1.</p>
<p>The border parameter tells the sizer how much area to leave around
the widget as padding.</p>
<p>The wx.EXPAND flag tells the sizer that we want the widget to expand
in the direction the sizer isn’t stacking. In this case, we’re stacking
vertically, but we also want this widget to expand horizontally.</p>
<p>The wx.ALL flag specifies which edges of the widget should have the
border area.</p>
<p>That’s it! Aside from managing a couple of fields, most of this code
is managing the UI, which is almost exactly what we’d want from a UI
class. Let’s write the first of the two panels that we swap in and
out.</p>
<p>GitHub login</p>
<p>The LoginPanel class is similar in structure to the SearchFrame
class, with a couple of key differences, which we’ll describe after the
wall of code.</p>
<p>class LoginPanel(wx.Panel): def <strong>init</strong>(self, *args,
**kwargs): self.callback = kwargs.pop(‘onlogin’, None)
wx.Panel.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs) self.create_controls()
self.do_layout() def create_controls(self): self.userLabel =
wx.StaticText(self, label=‘Username:’) self.userBox = wx.TextCtrl(self,
style=wx.TE_PROCESS_ENTER) self.passLabel = wx.StaticText(self,
label=‘Password (or token):’) self.passBox = wx.TextCtrl(self,
style=wx.TE_PROCESS_ENTER) self.login = wx.Button(self, label=‘Login’)
self.error = wx.StaticText(self, label=’’)
self.error.SetForegroundColour((200,0,0)) # Bind events
self.login.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.do_login)
self.userBox.Bind(wx.EVT_TEXT_ENTER, self.do_login)
self.passBox.Bind(wx.EVT_TEXT_ENTER, self.do_login) def do_layout(self):
# Grid arrangement for controls grid = wx.GridBagSizer(3,3)
grid.Add(self.userLabel, pos=(0,0), flag=wx.TOP | wx.LEFT | wx.BOTTOM,
border=5) grid.Add(self.userBox, pos=(0,1), flag=wx.EXPAND | wx.LEFT |
wx.RIGHT, border=5) grid.Add(self.passLabel, pos=(1,0), flag=wx.TOP |
wx.LEFT | wx.BOTTOM, border=5) grid.Add(self.passBox, pos=(1,1),
flag=wx.EXPAND | wx.LEFT | wx.RIGHT, border=5) grid.Add(self.login,
pos=(2,0), span=(1,2), flag=wx.EXPAND | wx.LEFT | wx.RIGHT, border=5)
grid.Add(self.error, pos=(3,0), span=(1,2), flag=wx.EXPAND | wx.LEFT |
wx.RIGHT, border=5) grid.AddGrowableCol(1) # Center the grid vertically
vbox = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL) vbox.Add((0,0), 1) vbox.Add(grid, 0,
wx.EXPAND) vbox.Add((0,0), 2) self.SetSizer(vbox) def do_login(self, _):
u = self.userBox.GetValue() p = self.passBox.GetValue() g = Github(u, p)
status,data = g.issues.get() if status != 200:
self.error.SetLabel(‘ERROR:’ + data〔‘message’〕) elif
callable(self.callback): self.callback(u, p)</p>
<p>There’s some structure that’s similar to above. We’ll start with the
constructor.</p>
<p>Recall that this panel is created with a keyword argument in the
SearchFrame class, like LoginPanel(self, onlogin=self.login_accepted).
In the constructor definition, we pull that callback out and store it
for later. Afterward, we just call the two other construction functions
and return.</p>
<p>create_controls has more to it than SearchFrame’s version, because
this panel has more controls. Every static-text, text-input, and button
control gets its own line of code. The wx.TE_PROCESS_ENTER style tells
the library that we want an event to be triggered if the user presses
the enter key while the cursor is inside that text box.</p>
<p>The next block binds control events to method calls. Every event in
WxPython will call the handler with a single argument, an object which
contains information about the event. That means we can use the same
event handler for any number of different kinds of events, so we do –
the ENTER handlers for both text boxes and the BUTTON handler for the
button all go through self.do_login.</p>
<p>do_layout uses a different kind of sizer – a GridBagSizer. Again, the
topic of sizers is way outside the scope of this chapter, but just know
that this kind arranges things in a grid, and you can allow some of the
rows or columns to stretch to fill the container. Here we drop all of
the controls into their positions with the pos=(r,c) notation (here
“rows” come first, which isn’t like most coordinate systems), and cause
one control to span two columns with the span parameter. The flags and
border parameters mostly mean the same thins as before, and the
AddGrowableCol function tells the layout engine which parts of the grid
should be allowed to stretch.</p>
<p>Then we do something curious: we put the GridBagSizer into another
sizer. Sizer nesting is a powerful feature, and allows almost any window
layout to be possible—although perhaps not easy or simple. The vertical
box sizer also contains some bare tuples; this special form is called
“adding a spacer.” In this case, we sandwich the sizer with all the
controls between two spacers with different weights, making it float
about a third of the way down the window. The effect is like Figure
4-3.</p>
<p>Figure 4-3. Resizing behavior of login UI</p>
<p>Then comes the do_login method, which tests out the given
credentials, and if they work, passes them back through the callback set
at construction time. If they don’t work, it sets the text of a label,
whose foreground color has been set to a nice, alarming shade of
red.</p>
<p>GitHub search</p>
<p>Once the user has successfully logged in, we destroy the LoginPanel
instance and show the SearchPanel.</p>
<p>class SearchPanel(wx.Panel): def <strong>init</strong>(self, *args,
**kwargs): self.orgs = kwargs.pop(‘orgs’, 〔〕) self.credentials =
kwargs.pop(‘credentials’, {}) wx.Panel.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
self.create_controls() self.do_layout() def create_controls(self):
self.results_panel = None self.orgChoice = wx.Choice(self,
choices=self.orgs, style=wx.CB_SORT) self.searchTerm = wx.TextCtrl(self,
style=wx.TE_PROCESS_ENTER) self.searchTerm.SetFocus() self.searchButton
= wx.Button(self, label=“Search“) # Bind events
self.searchButton.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.do_search)
self.searchTerm.Bind(wx.EVT_TEXT_ENTER, self.do_search) def
do_layout(self): # Arrange choice, query box, and button horizontally
hbox = wx.BoxSizer(wx.HORIZONTAL) hbox.Add(self.orgChoice, 0, wx.EXPAND)
hbox.Add(self.searchTerm, 1, wx.EXPAND | wx.LEFT, 5)
hbox.Add(self.searchButton, 0, wx.EXPAND | wx.LEFT, 5) # Dock everything
to the top, leaving room for the results self.vbox =
wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL) self.vbox.Add(hbox, 0, wx.EXPAND)
self.SetSizer(self.vbox) def do_search(self, event): term =
self.searchTerm.GetValue() org =
self.orgChoice.GetString(self.orgChoice.GetCurrentSelection()) g =
Github(self.credentials〔‘username’〕, self.credentials〔‘password’〕)
code,data = g.search.issues.get(q=“user:{} {}“.format(org, term)) if
code != 200: self.display_error(code, data) else:
self.display_results(data〔‘items’〕) def display_results(self,
results): if self.results_panel: self.results_panel.Destroy()
self.results_panel = SearchResultsPanel(self, -1, results=results)
self.vbox.Add(self.results_panel, 1, wx.EXPAND | wx.TOP, 5)
self.vbox.Layout() def display_error(self, code, data): if
self.results_panel: self.results_panel.Destroy() if ‘errors’ in data:
str = ’‘.join(’</p>
<p>{}‘.format(e〔’message’〕) for e in data〔‘errors’〕) else: str =
data〔‘message’〕 self.results_panel = wx.StaticText(self, label=str)
self.results_panel.SetForegroundColour((200,0,0))
self.vbox.Add(self.results_panel, 1, wx.EXPAND | wx.TOP, 5)
self.vbox.Layout() width = self.results_panel.GetSize().x
self.results_panel.Wrap(width)</p>
<p>There’s quite a bit here, but some of it is familiar. We’ll skip the
usual walkthrough, to point out a couple of interesting features.</p>
<p>When creating the panel, we pass in the user’s credentials and list
of organizations.</p>
<p>When we add the search bar to the sizer, we use 0 as a scale factor.
This means that it shouldn’t exand to fit the available size, but keep
its own size instead, to leave room to add a results panel later on.</p>
<p>Here’s where the actual search is being done.</p>
<p>We pass the search results into another class, then add it to the
main sizer with parameters to fill the remaining available space.</p>
<p>If an error is returned from the search call instead, we display it
here. There’s some code to adjust the wrap width of the text, based on
the laid-out width of the control. This isn’t a great approach; doing it
better is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>Again, there’s a fair amount of code here, but most of it should look
familiar.</p>
<p>Displaying results</p>
<p>So now we have our login panel, and a way for the user to enter a
search query, but no way to display results. Let’s fix that.</p>
<p>Whenever search results are retrieved, we create a new instance of
SearchResultsPanel, which then creates a series of SearchResult
instances. Let’s look at both of them together:</p>
<p>class SearchResultsPanel(wx.ScrolledWindow): def
<strong>init</strong>(self, *args, **kwargs): results =
kwargs.pop(‘results’, 〔〕) wx.PyScrolledWindow.__init__(self, *args,
**kwargs) # Layout search result controls inside scrollable area vbox =
wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL) if not results: vbox.Add(wx.StaticText(self,
label=“(no results)“), 0, wx.EXPAND) for r in results:
vbox.Add(SearchResult(self, result=r), flag=wx.TOP | wx.BOTTOM,
border=8) self.SetSizer(vbox) self.SetScrollbars(0, 4, 0, 0) class
SearchResult(wx.Panel): def <strong>init</strong>(self, *args,
**kwargs): self.result = kwargs.pop(‘result’, {})
wx.Panel.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs) self.create_controls()
self.do_layout() def create_controls(self): titlestr =
self.result〔‘title’〕 if self.result〔‘state’〕 != ‘open’: titlestr +=
’ ({})‘.format(self.result〔’state’〕) textstr =
self.first_line(self.result〔‘body’〕) self.title = wx.StaticText(self,
label=titlestr) self.text = wx.StaticText(self, label=textstr) # Adjust
the title font titleFont = wx.Font(16, wx.FONTFAMILY_DEFAULT,
wx.FONTSTYLE_NORMAL, wx.FONTWEIGHT_BOLD) self.title.SetFont(titleFont) #
Bind click and hover events on this whole control
self.Bind(wx.EVT_LEFT_UP, self.on_click) self.Bind(wx.EVT_ENTER_WINDOW,
self.enter) self.Bind(wx.EVT_LEAVE_WINDOW, self.leave) def
do_layout(self): vbox = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL) vbox.Add(self.title,
flag=wx.EXPAND | wx.BOTTOM, border=2) vbox.Add(self.text,
flag=wx.EXPAND) self.SetSizer(vbox) def enter(self, <em>):
self.title.SetForegroundColour(wx.BLUE)
self.text.SetForegroundColour(wx.BLUE) def leave(self, </em>):
self.title.SetForegroundColour(wx.BLACK)
self.text.SetForegroundColour(wx.BLACK) def on_click(self, event):
import webbrowser webbrowser.open(self.result〔‘html_url’〕) def
first_line(self, body): return body.split(’</p>
<p>‘)〔0〕.strip() or’(no body)’</p>
<p>The containing panel is simple enough that it only consists of a
constructor. This class’s job is to contain the results, and present
them in a scroll window.</p>
<p>A SearchResult comprises two static text controls, which contain the
issue’s title and the first line of its body.</p>
<p>We’re binding the click handler for this entire panel, but also the
mouse-enter and mouse-leave events, so we can make it behavior more like
a link in a browser.</p>
<p>Here’s how you open the default browser to a URL in Python.</p>
<p>Overall, WxPython isn’t so bad, once you get used to it. It lacks
some facilities of newer frameworks, but there’s nothing better for
getting a basic cross-platform UI out the door quickly.</p>
<p>That’s all of the code! If you’ve been following along, you can run
this code file and do issue searches. However, our use case has a
non-technical user runnnig this; let’s see what can be done to make it
easy for them.</p>
<p>Packaging</p>
<p>What we’re not going to do is require anyone to install Python 2.7
and a bunch of packages. We’ll use PyInstaller to bundle our application
into something that’s easy to distribute and run.</p>
<p>Let’s assume you wrote all the code above into a file called
search.py, and agithub.py is sitting in the same directory. Here’s how
to tell PyInstaller to generate a single application for you:</p>
<p>$ pyinstaller -w search.py</p>
<p>That’s it! The -w flag tells PyInstaller to create a “windowed” build
of your application, rather than the default console build. On OS X,
this generates a search.app application bundle, and on Windows this
generates a search.exe file. You can take either of these to a computer
with no Python installed, and they’ll run perfectly.</p>
<p>That’s because PyInstaller has copied everything necessary for your
program to run, from the Python interpreter on up, inside that file. The
one I just generated is 67MB, which seems large for such a simple
program, but that number is more reasonable when you consider what’s
inside the package.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Whew! This chapter was quite a journey. Let’s take a breath, and look
at what we’ve learned.</p>
<p>The main bulk of the code in this chapter had to do with defining a
graphical interface. Code for this task is always pretty verbose,
because of the sheer complexity of the task. With WxPython in your tool
belt, however, you can now write GUI applications using Python, with
code that’s no harder to write than with other toolkits, and get the
ability to run on every major platform for free.</p>
<p>We saw how to ask Git for credentials to a Git server using ‘git
credential`. This feature is quite capable, and includes the ability to
write a custom credential storage back-end, but we at least saw a peek
into how it works. Using this knowledge, you can piggy-back on your
users’ existing habits to avoid having to ask them for the same things
over and over again.</p>
<p>We also saw a rather nice HTTP API abstraction with agithub. We
authenticated and queried the issue-search API endpoint, using what
looked like object-method notation. agithub is a great example of how a
library package can be both future-proof and idiomatic – the library
constructs a query URL by looking at the chain of properties and methods
used in the call. This is a great jumping-off point for querying other
REST APIs using the same pattern.</p>
<p>Finally, the main thrust of this chapter was using the GitHub search
API. You’ve learned about its general behavior, the different categories
of search, how to interpret and sort results, and ways of focusing a
search to reduce the number of uninteresting results. Using this
knowledge you should be able to find anything you’re looking for on
GitHub or GitHub Enterprise. You also know that the search UI on GitHub
is just a thin layer over the search API, so the same tricks and
techniques will serve you whether you’re writing code or using a
browser.</p>
<p>In the next chapter we will look at using DotNET with the Commit
Status API.</p>
