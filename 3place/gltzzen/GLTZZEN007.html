<h4 id="chapter-si">CHAPTER SI</h4>
<p>XADVANCE OF THE ARMY — CROSSING THE COLORADO — THE RIO GRANDE</p>
<p>AT LAST THE PREPARATIONS WERE COMPLETE AND ORDERS WERE issued for the
advance to begin on the 8th of March. General Taylor had an army of not
more than three thousand men. One battery, the siege guns and all the
convalescent troops were sent on by water to Brazos Santiago, at the
mouth of the Rio Grande. A guard was left back at Corpus Christi to look
after public property and to take care of those who were too sick to be
removed. The remainder of the army, probably not more than twenty five
hundred men, was divided into three brigades, with the cavalry
independent. Colonel Twiggs, with seven companies of dragoons and a
battery of light artillery, moved on the 8th. He was followed by the
three infantry brigades, with a day’s interval between the commands.
Thus the rear brigade did not move from Corpus Christi until the 11th of
March. In view of the immense bodies of men moved on the same day over
narrow roads, through dense forests and across large streams, in our
late war, it seems strange now that a body of less than three thousand
men should have been broken into four columns, separated by a day’s
march.</p>
<p>General Taylor was opposed to anything like plundering by the troops,
and in this instance, I doubt not, he looked upon the enemy as the
aggrieved party and was not willing to injure them further than his
instructions from Washington demanded. His orders to the troops enjoined
scrupulous regard for the rights of all peaceable persons and the
payment of the highest price for all supplies taken for the use of the
army.</p>
<p>All officers of foot regiments who had horses were permitted to ride
them on the march when it did not interfere with their military duties.
As already related, having lost my “five or six dollars’ worth of
horses” but a short time before I determined not to get another, but to
make the journey on foot. My company commander, Captain McCall, had two
good American horses, of considerably more value in that country, where
native horses were cheap, than they were in the States. He used one
himself and wanted the other for his servant. He was quite anxious to
know whether I did not intend to get me another horse before the march
began. I told him No; I belonged to a foot regiment. I did not
understand the object of his solicitude at the time, but, when we were
about to start, he said: “There, Grant, is a horse for you.” I found
that he could not bear the idea of his servant riding on a long march
while his lieutenant went a-foot. He had found a mustang, a
three-year-old colt only recently captured, which had been purchased by
one of the colored servants with the regiment for the sum of three
dollars. It was probably the only horse at Corpus Christi that could
have been purchased just then for any reasonable price. Five dollars,
sixty-six and two-thirds per cent. advance, induced the owner to part
with the mustang. I was sorry to take him, because I really felt that,
belonging to a foot regiment, it was my duty to march with the men. But
I saw the captain’s earnestness in the matter, and accepted the horse
for the trip. The day we started was the first time the horse had ever
been under saddle. I had, however, but little difficulty in breaking
him, though for the first day there were frequent disagreements between
us as to which way we should go, and sometimes whether we should go at
all. At no time during the day could I choose exactly the part of the
column I would march with; but after that, I had as tractable a horse as
any with the army, and there was none that stood the trip better. He
never ate a mouthful of food on the journey except the grass he could
pick within the length of his picket rope.</p>
<p>A few days out from Corpus Christi, the immense herd of wild horses
that ranged at that time between the Nueces and the Rio Grande was seen
directly in advance of the head of the column and but a few miles off.
It was the very band from which the horse I was riding had been captured
but a few weeks before. The column was halted for a rest, and a number
of officers, myself among them, rode out two or three miles to the right
to see the extent of the herd. The country was a rolling prairie, and,
from the higher ground, the vision was obstructed only by the earth’s
curvature. As far as the eye could reach to our right, the herd
extended. To the left, it extended equally. There was no estimating the
number of animals in it; I have no idea that they could all have been
corralled in the State of Rhode Island, or Delaware, at one time. If
they had been, they would have been so thick that the pasturage would
have given out the first day. People who saw the Southern herd of
buffalo, fifteen or twenty years ago, can appreciate the size of the
Texas band of wild horses in 1846.</p>
<p>At the point where the army struck the Colorado River, the stream was
quite wide and of sufficient depth for navigation. The water was
brackish and the banks were fringed with timber. Here the whole army
concentrated before attempting to cross. The army was not accompanied by
a pontoon train, and at that time the troops were not instructed in
bridge building. To add to the embarrassment of the situation, the army
was here, for the first time, threatened with opposition. Buglers,
concealed from our view by the brush on the opposite side, sounded the
“assembly,” and other military calls. Like the wolves before spoken of,
they gave the impression that there was a large number of them and that,
if the troops were in proportion to the noise, they were sufficient to
devour General Taylor and his army. There were probably but few troops,
and those engaged principally in watching the movements of the
“invader.” A few of our cavalry dashed in, and forded and swam the
stream, and all opposition was soon dispersed. I do not remember that a
single shot was fired.</p>
<p>The troops waded the stream, which was up to their necks in the
deepest part. Teams were crossed by attaching a long rope to the end of
the wagon tongue, passing it between the two swing mules and by the side
of the leader, hitching his bridle as well as the bridle of the mules in
rear to it, and carrying the end to men on the opposite shore. The bank
down to the water was steep on both sides. A rope long enough to cross
the river, therefore, was attached to the back axle of the wagon, and
men behind would hold the rope to prevent the wagon “beating” the mules
into the water. This latter rope also served the purpose of bringing the
end of the forward one back, to be used over again. The water was deep
enough for a short distance to swim the little Mexican mules which the
army was then using, but they, and the wagons, were pulled through so
fast by the men at the end of the rope ahead, that no time was left them
to show their obstinacy. In this manner the artillery and transportation
of the “army of occupation” crossed the Colorado River.</p>
<p>About the middle of the month of March the advance of the army
reached the Rio Grande and went into camp near the banks of the river,
opposite the city of Matamoras and almost under the guns of a small fort
at the lower end of the town. There was not at that time a single
habitation from Corpus Christi until the Rio Grande was reached.</p>
<p>The work of fortifying was commenced at once. The fort was laid out
by the engineers, but the work was done by the soldiers under the
supervision of their officers, the chief engineer retaining general
directions. The Mexicans now became so incensed at our near approach
that some of their troops crossed the river above us, and made it unsafe
for small bodies of men to go far beyond the limits of camp. They
captured two companies of dragoons, commanded by Captains Thornton and
Hardee. The latter figured as a general in the late war, on the
Confederate side, and was author of the tactics first used by both
armies. Lieutenant Theodric Porter, of the 4th infantry, was killed
while out with a small detachment; and Major Cross, the assistant
quartermaster-general, had also been killed not far from camp.</p>
<p>There was no base of supplies nearer than Point Isabel, on the coast,
north of the mouth of the Rio Grande and twenty-five miles away. The
enemy, if the Mexicans could be called such at this time when no war had
been declared, hovered about in such numbers that it was not safe to
send a wagon train after supplies with any escort that could be spared.
I have already said that General Taylor’s whole command on the Rio
Grande numbered less than three thousand men. He had, however, a few
more troops at Point Isabel or Brazos Santiago. The supplies brought
from Corpus Christi in wagons were running short. Work was therefore
pushed with great vigor on the defences, to enable the minimum number of
troops to hold the fort. All the men who could be employed, were kept at
work from early dawn until darkness closed the labors of the day. With
all this the fort was not completed until the supplies grew so short
that further delay in obtaining more could not be thought of. By the
latter part of April the work was in a partially defensible condition,
and the 7th infantry, Major Jacob Brown commanding, was marched in to
garrison it, with some few pieces of artillery. All the supplies on
hand, with the exception of enough to carry the rest of the army to
Point Isabel, were left with the garrison, and the march was commenced
with the remainder of the command, every wagon being taken with the
army. Early on the second day after starting the force reached its
destination, without opposition from the Mexicans. There was some delay
in getting supplies ashore from vessels at anchor in the open
roadstead.</p>
