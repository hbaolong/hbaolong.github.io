<h4 id="chapter-xlvii">CHAPTER XLVII</h4>
<p>1 〔Private and Confidential.〕</p>
<p>HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D. C., April 4, 1864.</p>
<p>MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN,</p>
<p>Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>General: — It is my design, if the enemy keep quiet and allow me to
take the initiative in the spring campaign, to work all parts of the
army together, and somewhat towards a common centre. For your
information I now write you my programme, as at present determined
upon.</p>
<p>I have sent orders to Banks, by private messenger, to finish up his
present expedition against Shreveport with all dispatch; to turn over
the defence of Red River to General Steele and the navy, and to return
your troops to you and his own to New Orleans; to abandon all of Texas,
except the Rio Grande, and to hold that with not to exceed four thousand
men; to reduce the number of troops on the Mississippi to the lowest
number necessary to hold it, and to collect from his command not less
than twenty-five thousand men. To this I will add five thousand men from
Missouri. With this force he is to commence operations against Mobile as
soon as he can. It will be impossible for him to commence too early.</p>
<p>Gillmore joins Butler with ten thousand men, and the two operate
against Richmond from the south side of the James River. This will give
Butler thirty-three thousand men to operate with, W. F. Smith commanding
the right wing of his forces and Gillmore the left wing. I will stay
with the Army of the Potomac, increased by Burnside’s corps of not less
than twenty-five thousand effective men, and operate directly against
Lee’s army, wherever it may be found.</p>
<p>Sigel collects all his available force in two columns, one, under Ord
and Averell, to start from Beverly, Virginia, and the other, under
Crook, to start from Charleston on the Kanawha, to move against the
Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.</p>
<p>Crook will have all cavalry, and will endeavor to get in about
Saltville, and move east from there to join Ord. His force will be all
cavalry, while Ord will have from ten to twelve thousand men of all
arms.</p>
<p>You I propose to move against Johnston’s army, to break it up and to
get into the interior of the enemy’s country as far as you can,
inflicting all the damage you can against their war resources.</p>
<p>I do not propose to lay down for you a plan of campaign, but simply
lay down the work it is desirable to have done and leave you free to
execute it in your own way. Submit to me, however, as early as you can,
your plan of operations.</p>
<p>As stated, Banks is ordered to commence operations as soon as he can.
Gillmore is ordered to report at Fortress Monroe by the 18th inst., or
as soon thereafter as practicable. Sigel is concentrating now. None will
move from their places of rendezvous until I direct, except Banks. I
want to be ready to move by the 25th inst., if possible. But all I can
now direct is that you get ready as soon as possible. I know you will
have difficulties to encounter in getting through the mountains to where
supplies are abundant, but I believe you will accomplish it.</p>
<p>From the expedition from the Department of West Virginia I do not
calculate on very great results; but it is the only way I can take
troops from there. With the long line of railroad Sigel has to protect,
he can spare no troops except to move directly to his front. In this way
he must get through to inflict great damage on the enemy, or the enemy
must detach from one of his armies a large force to prevent it. In other
words, if Sigel can’t skin himself he can hold a leg while some one else
skins.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General.</p>
<p>2 See instructions to Butler, in Generals Grant’s report,
Appendix.</p>
<p>3 IN FIELD, CULPEPER C. H., VA.,</p>
<p>April 9, 1864.</p>
<p>MAJ.-GENERAL GEO. G. MEADE,</p>
<p>Com’d’g Army of the Potomac.</p>
<p>For information and as instruction to govern your preparations for
the coming campaign, the following is communicated confidentially for
your own perusal alone.</p>
<p>So far as practicable all the armies are to move together, and
towards one common centre. Banks has been instructed to turn over the
guarding of the Red River to General Steele and the navy, to abandon
Texas with the exception of the Rio Grande, and to concentrate all the
force he can, not less than 25,000 men, to move on Mobile. This he is to
do without reference to other movements. From the scattered condition of
his command, however, he cannot possibly get it together to leave New
Orleans before the 1st of May, if so soon. Sherman will move at the same
time you do, or two or three days in advance, Jo. Johnston’s army being
his objective point, and the heart of Georgia his ultimate aim. If
successful he will secure the line from Chattanooga to Mobile with the
aid of Banks.</p>
<p>Sigel cannot spare troops from his army to reinforce either of the
great armies, but he can aid them by moving directly to his front. This
he has been directed to do, and is now making preparations for it. Two
columns of his command will make south at the same time with the general
move; one from Beverly, from ten to twelve thousand strong, under
Major-General Oral; the other from Charleston, Va., principally cavalry,
under Brig.-General Crook. The former of these will endeavor to reach
the Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, about south of Covington, and if
found practicable will work eastward to Lynchburg and return to its base
by way of the Shenandoah Valley, or join you. The other will strike at
Saltville, Va., and come eastward to join Ord. The cavalry from Ord’s
command will try to force a passage southward, if they are successful in
reaching the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, to cut the main lines of
the road connecting Richmond with all the South and South-west.</p>
<p>Gillmore will join Butler with about 10,000 men from South Carolina.
Butler can reduce his garrison so as to take 23,000 men into the field
directly to his front. The force will be commanded by Maj.-General W. F.
Smith. With Smith and Gillmore, Butler will seize City Point, and
operate against Richmond from the south side of the river. His movement
will be simultaneous with yours.</p>
<p>Lee’s army will be your objective point. Wherever Lee goes, there you
will go also. The only point upon which I am now in doubt is, whether it
will be better to cross the Rapidan above or below him. Each plan
presents great advantages over the other with corresponding objections.
By crossing above, Lee is cut off from all chance of ignoring Richmond
and going north on a raid. But if we take this route, all we do must be
done whilst the rations we start with hold out. We separate from Butler
so that he cannot be directed how to cooperate. By the other route
Brandy Station can be used as a base of supplies until another is
secured on the York or James rivers.</p>
<p>These advantages and objections I will talk over with you more fully
than I can write them.</p>
<p>Burnside with a force of probably 25,000 men will reinforce you.
Immediately upon his arrival, which will be shortly after the 20th
inst., I will give him the defence of the road from Bull Run as far
south as we wish to hold it. This will enable you to collect all your
strength about Brandy Station and to the front.</p>
<p>There will be naval cooperation on the James River, and transports
and ferries will be provided so that should Lee fall back into his
intrenchments at Richmond, Butler’s force and yours will be a unit, or
at least can be made to act as such. What I would direct then, is that
you commence at once reducing baggage to the very lowest possible
standard. Two wagons to a regiment of five hundred men is the greatest
number that should be allowed, for all baggage, exclusive of subsistence
stores and ordnance stores. One wagon to brigade and one to division
headquarters is sufficient and about two to corps headquarters.</p>
<p>Should by Lee’s right flank be our route, you will want to make
arrangements for having supplies of all sorts promptly forwarded to
White House on the Pamunkey. Your estimates for this contingency should
be made at once. If not wanted there, there is every probability they
will be wanted on the James River or elsewhere.</p>
<p>If Lee’s left is turned, large provision will have to be made for
ordnance stores. I would say not much short of five hundred rounds of
infantry ammunition would do. By the other, half the amount would be
sufficient.</p>
<p>U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General.</p>
