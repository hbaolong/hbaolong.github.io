<h4 id="chapter-liv">CHAPTER LIV</h4>
<p>1 QUARLES’ MILLS, VA., May 26, 1864.</p>
<p>MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK,</p>
<p>Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>The relative position of the two armies is now as follows: Lee’s
right rests on a swamp east of the Richmond and Fredericksburg road and
south of the North Anna, his centre on the river at Ox Ford, and his
left at Little River with the crossings of Little River guarded as far
up as we have gone. Hancock with his corps and one division of the 9th
corps crossed at Chesterfield Ford and covers the right wing of Lee’s
army. One division of the 9th corps is on the north bank of the Anna at
Ox Ford, with bridges above and below at points nearest to it where both
banks are held by us, so that it could reinforce either wing of our army
with equal facility. The 5th and 6th corps with one division of the 9th
corps run from the south bank of the Anna from a short distance above Ox
Ford to Little River, and parallel with and near to the enemy.</p>
<p>To make a direct attack from either wing would cause a slaughter of
our men that even success would not justify. To turn the enemy by his
right, between the two Annas, is impossible on account of the swamp upon
which his right rests. To turn him by the left leaves Little River, New
Found River and South Anna River, all of them streams presenting
considerable obstacles to the movement of our army, to be crossed. I
have determined therefore to turn the enemy’s right by crossing at or
near Hanover Town. This crosses all three streams at once, and leaves us
still where we can draw supplies.</p>
<p>During the last night the teams and artillery not in position,
belonging to the right wing of our army, and one division of that wing
were quietly withdrawn to the north bank of the river and moved down to
the rear of the left. As soon as it is dark this division with most of
the cavalry will commence a forced march for Hanover Town to seize and
hold the crossings.</p>
<p>The balance of the right wing will withdraw at the same hour, and
follow as rapidly as possible. The left wing will also withdraw from the
south bank of the river tonight and follow in rear of the right
wing.</p>
<p>Lee’s army is really whipped. The prisoners we now take show it, and
the action of his army shows it unmistakably. A battle with them outside
of intrenchments cannot be had. Our men feel that they have gained the
morale over the enemy, and attack him with confidence. I may be
mistaken, but I feel that our success over Lee’s army is already
assured. The promptness and rapidity with which you have forwarded
reinforcements has contributed largely to the feeling of confidence
inspired in our men, and to break down that of the enemy.</p>
<p>We are destroying all the rails we can on the Central and
Fredericksburg roads. I want to leave a gap on the roads north of
Richmond so big that to get a single track they will have to import rail
from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Even if a crossing is not effected at Hanover Town it will probably
be necessary for us to move on down the Pamunkey until a crossing is
effected. I think it advisable therefore to change our base of supplies
from Port Royal to the White House. I wish you would direct this change
at once, and also direct Smith to put the railroad bridge there in
condition for crossing troops and artillery and leave men to hold
it.</p>
<p>U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>Lieut.-General.</p>
