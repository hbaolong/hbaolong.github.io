<h4 id="chapter-xlii">CHAPTER XLII</h4>
<p>1 CHATTANOOGA, November 18, 1863.</p>
<p>MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN:</p>
<p>Enclosed herewith I send you copy of instructions to Major-General
Thomas. You having been over the ground in person, and having heard the
whole matter discussed, further instructions will not be necessary for
you. It is particularly desirable that a force should be got through to
the railroad between Cleveland and Dalton, and Longstreet thus cut off
from communication with the South; but being confronted by a large force
here, strongly located, it is not easy to tell how this is to be
effected until the result of our first effort is known.</p>
<p>I will add, however, what is not shown in my instructions to Thomas,
that a brigade of cavalry has been ordered here which, if it arrives in
time, will be thrown across the Tennessee above Chickamauga, and may be
able to make the trip to Cleveland or thereabouts.</p>
<p>U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>Maj.-Gen’l.</p>
<p>CHATTANOOGA, November 18, 1863.</p>
<p>MAJOR-GENERAL GEO. H. THOMAS,</p>
<p>Chattanooga:</p>
<p>All preparations should be made for attacking the enemy’s position on
Missionary Ridge by Saturday at daylight. Not being provided with a map
giving names of roads, spurs of the mountains, and other places, such
definite instructions cannot be given as might be desirable. However,
the general plan, you understand, is for Sherman, with the force brought
with him strengthened by a division from your command, to effect a
crossing of the Tennessee River just below the mouth of Chickamauga; his
crossing to be protected by artillery from the heights on the north bank
of the river (to be located by your chief of artillery), and to secure
the heights on the northern extremity to about the railroad tunnel
before the enemy can concentrate against him. You will cooperate with
Sherman. The troops in Chattanooga Valley should be well concentrated on
your left flank, leaving only the necessary force to defend
fortifications on the right and centre, and a movable column of one
division in readiness to move wherever ordered. This division should
show itself as threateningly as possible on the most practicable line
for making an attack up the valley. Your effort then will be to form a
junction with Sherman, making your advance well towards the northern end
of Missionary Ridge, and moving as near simultaneously with him as
possible. The junction once formed and the ridge carried, communications
will be at once established between the two armies by roads on the south
bank of the river. Further movements will then depend on those of the
enemy. Lookout Valley, I think, will be easily held by Geary’s division
and what troops you may still have there belonging to the old Army of
the Cumberland. Howard’s corps can then be held in readiness to act
either with you at Chattanooga or with Sherman. It should be marched on
Friday night to a position on the north side of the river, not lower
down than the first pontoon-bridge, and there held in readiness for such
orders as may become necessary. All these troops will be provided with
two days’ cooked rations in haversacks, and one hundred rounds of
ammunition on the person of each infantry soldier. Special care should
be taken by all officers to see that ammunition is not wasted or
unnecessarily fired away. You will call on the engineer department for
such preparations as you may deem necessary for carrying your infantry
and artillery over the creek.</p>
<p>U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>Major-General.</p>
