<h4 id="chapter-sixty-nine">CHAPTER SIXTY NINE</h4>
<p>SHERMAN AND JOHNSTON — JOHNSTON’S SURRENDER TO SHERMAN — CAPTURE OF
MOBILE — WILSON’S EXPEDITION — CAPTURE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS — GENERAL
THOMAS’S QUALITIES — ESTIMATE OF GENERAL CANBY</p>
<p>WHEN I LEFT APPOMATTOX I ORDERED GENERAL MEADE TO PROCEED leisurely
back to Burkesville Station with the Army of the Potomac and the Army of
the James, and to go into camp there until further orders from me.
General Johnston, as has been stated before, was in North Carolina
confronting General Sherman. It could not be known positively, of
course, whether Johnston would surrender on the news of Lee’s surrender,
though I supposed he would; and if he did not, Burkesville Station was
the natural point from which to move to attack him. The army which I
could have sent against him was superior to his, and that with which
Sherman confronted him was also superior; and between the two he would
necessarily have been crushed, or driven away. With the loss of their
capital and the Army of Northern Virginia it was doubtful whether
Johnston’s men would have had the spirit to stand. My belief was that he
would make no such attempt; but I adopted this course as a precaution
against what might happen, however improbable.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with my starting from City Point, I sent a messenger
to North Carolina by boat with dispatches to General Sherman, informing
him of the surrender of Lee and his army; also of the terms which I had
given him; and I authorized Sherman to give the same terms to Johnston
if the latter chose to accept them. The country is familiar with the
terms that Sherman agreed to conditionally, because they embraced a
political question as well as a military one and he would therefore have
to confer with the government before agreeing to them definitely.</p>
<p>General Sherman had met Mr. Lincoln at City Point while visiting
there to confer with me about our final movement, and knew what
Mr. Lincoln had said to the peace commissioners when he met them at
Hampton Roads, viz.: that before he could enter into negotiations with
them they would have to agree to two points: one being that the Union
should be preserved, and the other that slavery should be abolished; and
if they were ready to concede these two points he was almost ready to
sign his name to a blank piece of paper and permit them to fill out the
balance of the terms upon which we would live together. He had also seen
notices in the newspapers of Mr. Lincoln’s visit to Richmond, and had
read in the same papers that while there he had authorized the convening
of the Legislature of Virginia.</p>
<p>Sherman thought, no doubt, in adding to the terms that I had made
with General Lee, that he was but carrying out the wishes of the
President of the United States. But seeing that he was going beyond his
authority, he made it a point that the terms were only conditional. They
signed them with this understanding, and agreed to a truce until the
terms could be sent to Washington for approval; if approved by the
proper authorities there, they would then be final; if not approved,
then he would give due notice, before resuming hostilities. As the world
knows, Sherman, from being one of the most popular generals of the land
(Congress having even gone so far as to propose a bill providing for a
second lieutenant-general for the purpose of advancing him to that
grade), was denounced by the President and Secretary of War in very
bitter terms. Some people went so far as to denounce him as a traitor —
a most preposterous term to apply to a man who had rendered so much
service as he had, even supposing he had made a mistake in granting such
terms as he did to Johnston and his army. If Sherman had taken authority
to send Johnston with his army home, with their arms to be put in the
arsenals of their own States, without submitting the question to the
authorities at Washington, the suspicions against him might have some
foundation. But the feeling against Sherman died out very rapidly, and
it was not many weeks before he was restored to the fullest confidence
of the American people.</p>
<p>When, some days after my return to Washington, President Johnson and
the Secretary of War received the terms which General Sherman had
forwarded for approval, a cabinet meeting was immediately called and I
was sent for. There seemed to be the greatest consternation, lest
Sherman would commit the government to terms which they were not willing
to accede to and which he had no right to grant. A message went out
directing the troops in the South not to obey General Sherman. I was
ordered to proceed at once to North Carolina and take charge of matters
there myself. Of course I started without delay, and reached there as
soon as possible. I repaired to Raleigh, where Sherman was, as quietly
as possible, hoping to see him without even his army learning of my
presence.</p>
<p>When I arrived I went to Sherman’s headquarters, and we were at once
closeted together. I showed him the instructions and orders under which
I visited him. I told him that I wanted him to notify General Johnston
that the terms which they had conditionally agreed upon had not been
approved in Washington, and that he was authorized to offer the same
terms I had given General Lee. I sent Sherman to do this himself. I did
not wish the knowledge of my presence to be known to the army generally;
so I left it to Sherman to negotiate the terms of the surrender solely
by himself, and without the enemy knowing that I was anywhere near the
field. As soon as possible I started to get away, to leave Sherman quite
free and untrammelled.</p>
<p>At Goldsboro, on my way back, I met a mail, containing the last
newspapers, and I found in them indications of great excitement in the
North over the terms Sherman had given Johnston; and harsh orders that
had been promulgated by the President and Secretary of War. I knew that
Sherman must see these papers, and I fully realized what great
indignation they would cause him, though I do not think his feelings
could have been more excited than were my own. But like the true and
loyal soldier that he was, he carried out the instructions I had given
him, obtained the surrender of Johnston’s army, and settled down in his
camp about Raleigh, to await final orders.</p>
<p>There were still a few expeditions out in the South that could not be
communicated with, and had to be left to act according to the judgment
of their respective commanders. With these it was impossible to tell how
the news of the surrender of Lee and Johnston, of which they must have
heard, might affect their judgment as to what was best to do.</p>
<p>The three expeditions which I had tried so hard to get off from the
commands of Thomas and Canby did finally get off: one under Canby
himself, against Mobile, late in March; that under Stoneman from East
Tennessee on the 20th; and the one under Wilson, starting from Eastport,
Mississippi, on the 22d of March. They were all eminently successful,
but without any good result. Indeed much valuable property was destroyed
and many lives lost at a time when we would have liked to spare them.
The war was practically over before their victories were gained. They
were so late in commencing operations, that they did not hold any troops
away that otherwise would have been operating against the armies which
were gradually forcing the Confederate armies to a surrender. The only
possible good that we may have experienced from these raids was by
Stoneman’s getting near Lynchburg about the time the armies of the
Potomac and the James were closing in on Lee at Appomattox.</p>
<p>Stoneman entered North Carolina and then pushed north to strike the
Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. He got upon that road, destroyed its
bridges at different places and rendered the road useless to the enemy
up to within a few miles of Lynchburg. His approach caused the
evacuation of that city about the time we were at Appomattox, and was
the cause of a commotion we heard of there. He then pushed south, and
was operating in the rear of Johnston’s army about the time the
negotiations were going on between Sherman and Johnston for the latter’s
surrender. In this raid Stoneman captured and destroyed a large amount
of stores, while fourteen guns and nearly two thousand prisoners were
the trophies of his success.</p>
<p>Canby appeared before Mobile on the 27th of March. The city of Mobile
was protected by two forts, besides other intrenchments — Spanish Fort,
on the east side of the bay, and Fort Blakely, north of the city. These
forts were invested. On the night of the 8th of April, the National
troops having carried the enemy’s works at one point, Spanish Fort was
evacuated; and on the 9th, the very day of Lee’s surrender, Blakely was
carried by assault, with a considerable loss to us. On the 11th the city
was evacuated.</p>
<p>I had tried for more than two years to have an expedition sent
against Mobile when its possession by us would have been of great
advantage. It finally cost lives to take it when its possession was of
no importance, and when, if left alone, it would within a few days have
fallen into our hands without any bloodshed whatever.</p>
<p>Wilson moved out with full 12,000 men, well equipped and well armed.
He was an energetic officer and accomplished his work rapidly. Forrest
was in his front, but with neither his old-time army nor his old-time
prestige. He now had principally conscripts. His conscripts were
generally old men and boys. He had a few thousand regular cavalry left,
but not enough to even retard materially the progress of Wilson’s
cavalry. Selma fell on the 2d of April, with a large number of prisoners
and a large quantity of war material, machine shops, etc., to be
disposed of by the victors. Tuscaloosa, Montgomery and West Point fell
in quick succession. These were all important points to the enemy by
reason of their railroad connections, as depots of supplies, and because
of their manufactories of war material. They were fortified or
intrenched, and there was considerable fighting before they were
captured. Macon surrendered on the 21st of April. Here news was received
of the negotiations for the surrender of Johnston’s army. Wilson
belonged to the military division commanded by Sherman, and of course
was bound by his terms. This stopped all fighting.</p>
<p>General Richard Taylor had now become the senior Confederate officer
still at liberty east of the Mississippi River, and on the 4th of May he
surrendered everything within the limits of this extensive command.
General E. Kirby Smith surrendered the trans-Mississippi department on
the 26th of May, leaving no other Confederate army at liberty to
continue the war.</p>
<p>Wilson’s raid resulted in the capture of the fugitive president of
the defunct confederacy before he got out of the country. This occurred
at Irwinsville, Georgia, on the 11th of May. For myself, and I believe
Mr. Lincoln shared the feeling, I would have been very glad to have seen
Mr. Davis succeed in escaping, but for one reason: I feared that if not
captured, he might get into the trans-Mississippi region and there set
up a more contracted confederacy. The young men now out of homes and out
of employment might have rallied under his standard and protracted the
war yet another year. The Northern people were tired of the war, they
were tired of piling up a debt which would be a further mortgage upon
their homes.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln, I believe, wanted Mr. Davis to escape, because he did
not wish to deal with the matter of his punishment. He knew there would
be people clamoring for the punishment of the ex-Confederate president,
for high treason. He thought blood enough had already been spilled to
atone for our wickedness as a nation. At all events he did not wish to
be the judge to decide whether more should be shed or not. But his own
life was sacrificed at the hands of an assassin before the ex-president
of the Confederacy was a prisoner in the hands of the government which
he had lent all his talent and all his energies to destroy.</p>
<p>All things are said to be wisely directed, and for the best interest
of all concerned. This reflection does not, however, abate in the
slightest our sense of bereavement in the untimely loss of so good and
great a man as Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>He would have proven the best friend the South could have had, and
saved much of the wrangling and bitterness of feeling brought out by
reconstruction under a President who at first wished to revenge himself
upon Southern men of better social standing than himself, but who still
sought their recognition, and in a short time conceived the idea and
advanced the proposition to become their Moses to lead them triumphantly
out of all their difficulties.</p>
<p>The story of the legislation enacted during the reconstruction period
to stay the hands of the President is too fresh in the minds of the
people to be told now. Much of it, no doubt, was unconstitutional; but
it was hoped that the laws enacted would serve their purpose before the
question of constitutionality could be submitted to the judiciary and a
decision obtained. These laws did serve their purpose, and now remain “a
dead letter” upon the statute books of the United States, no one taking
interest enough in them to give them a passing thought.</p>
<p>Much was said at the time about the garb Mr. Davis was wearing when
he was captured. I cannot settle this question from personal knowledge
of the facts; but I have been under the belief, from information given
to me by General Wilson shortly after the event, that when Mr. Davis
learned that he was surrounded by our cavalry he was in his tent dressed
in a gentleman’s dressing gown. Naturally enough, Mr. Davis wanted to
escape, and would not reflect much how this should be accomplished
provided it might be done successfully. If captured, he would be no
ordinary prisoner. He represented all there was of that hostility to the
government which had caused four years of the bloodiest war — and the
most costly in other respects of which history makes any record. Every
one supposed he would be tried for treason if captured, and that he
would be executed. Had he succeeded in making his escape in any disguise
it would have been adjudged a good thing afterwards by his admirers.</p>
<p>As my official letters on file in the War Department, as well as my
remarks in this book, reflect upon General Thomas by dwelling somewhat
upon his tardiness, it is due to myself, as well as to him, that I give
my estimate of him as a soldier. The same remark will apply also in the
case of General Canby. I had been at West Point with Thomas one year,
and had known him later in the old army. He was a man of commanding
appearance, slow and deliberate in speech and action; sensible, honest
and brave. He possessed valuable soldierly qualities in an eminent
degree. He gained the confidence of all who served under him, and almost
their love. This implies a very valuable quality. It is a quality which
calls out the most efficient services of the troops serving under the
commander possessing it.</p>
<p>Thomas’s dispositions were deliberately made, and always good. He
could not be driven from a point he was given to hold. He was not as
good, however, in pursuit as he was in action. I do not believe that he
could ever have conducted Sherman’s army from Chattanooga to Atlanta
against the defences and the commander guarding that line in 1864. On
the other hand, if it had been given him to hold the line which Johnston
tried to hold, neither that general nor Sherman, nor any other officer
could have done it better.</p>
<p>Thomas was a valuable officer, who richly deserved, as he has
received, the plaudits of his countrymen for the part he played in the
great tragedy of 1861-5.</p>
<p>General Canby was an officer of great merit. He was naturally
studious, and inclined to the law. There have been in the army but very
few, if any, officers who took as much interest in reading and digesting
every act of Congress and every regulation for the government of the
army as he. His knowledge gained in this way made him a most valuable
staff officer, a capacity in which almost all his army services were
rendered up to the time of his being assigned to the Military Division
of the Gulf. He was an exceedingly modest officer, though of great
talent and learning. I presume his feelings when first called upon to
command a large army against a fortified city, were somewhat like my own
when marching a regiment against General Thomas Harris in Missouri in
1861. Neither of us would have felt the slightest trepidation in going
into battle with some one else commanding. Had Canby been in other
engagements afterwards, he would, I have no doubt, have advanced without
any fear arising from a sense of the responsibility. He was afterwards
killed in the lava beds of Southern Oregon, while in pursuit of the
hostile Modoc Indians. His character was as pure as his talent and
learning were great. His services were valuable during the war, but
principally as a bureau officer. I have no idea that it was from choice
that his services were rendered in an office, but because of his
superior efficiency there.</p>
