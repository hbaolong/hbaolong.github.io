<h4 id="chapter-lvi">CHAPTER LVI</h4>
<p>1 COLD HARBOR, June 5, 1864.</p>
<p>MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Chief of Staff of the Army,</p>
<p>Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>A full survey of all the ground satisfies me that it would be
impracticable to hold a line north-east of Richmond that would protect
the Fredericksburg Railroad to enable us to use that road for supplying
the army. To do so would give us a long vulnerable line of road to
protect, exhausting much of our strength to guard it, and would leave
open to the enemy all of his lines of communication on the south side of
the James. My idea from the start has been to beat Lee’s army if
possible north of Richmond; then after destroying his lines of
communication on the north side of the James River to transfer the army
to the south side and besiege Lee in Richmond, or follow him south if he
should retreat.</p>
<p>I now find, after over thirty days of trial, the enemy deems it of
the first importance to run no risks with the armies they now have. They
act purely on the defensive behind breastworks, or feebly on the
offensive immediately in front of them, and where in case of repulse
they can instantly retire behind them. Without a greater sacrifice of
human life than I am willing to make all cannot be accomplished that I
had designed outside of the city. I have therefore resolved upon the
following plan:</p>
<p>I will continue to hold substantially the ground now occupied by the
Army of the Potomac, taking advantage of any favorable circumstance that
may present itself until the cavalry can be sent west to destroy the
Virginia Central Railroad from about Beaver Dam for some twenty-five or
thirty miles west. When this is effected I will move the army to the
south side of the James River, either by crossing the Chickahominy and
marching near to City Point, or by going to the mouth of the
Chickahominy on north side and crossing there. To provide for this last
and most possible contingency, several ferry-boats of the largest class
ought to be immediately provided.</p>
<p>Once on the south side of the James River, I can cut off all sources
of supply to the enemy except what is furnished by the canal. If Hunter
succeeds in reaching Lynchburg, that will be lost to him also. Should
Hunter not succeed, I will still make the effort to destroy the canal by
sending cavalry up the south side of the river with a pontoon train to
cross wherever they can.</p>
<p>The feeling of the two armies now seems to be that the rebels can
protect themselves only by strong intrenchments, whilst our army is not
only confident of protecting itself without intrenchments, but that it
can beat and drive the enemy wherever and whenever he can be found
without this protection.</p>
<p>U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General.</p>
<p>2 COLD HARBOR, VA., June 6, 1864.</p>
<p>MAJOR-GENERAL D. HUNTER,</p>
<p>Commanding Dept. W. Va.</p>
<p>General Sheridan leaves here tomorrow morning, with instructions to
proceed to Charlottesville, Va., and to commence there the destruction
of the Va. Cen. R. R., destroying this way as much as possible. The
complete destruction of this road and of the canal on James River is of
great importance to us. According to the instructions I sent to General
Halleck for your guidance, you were to proceed to Lynchburg and commence
there. It would be of great value to us to get possession of Lynchburg
for a single day. But that point is of so much importance to the enemy,
that in attempting to get it such resistance may be met as to defeat
your getting onto the road or canal at all. I see, in looking over the
letter to General Halleck on the subject of your instructions, that it
rather indicates that your route should be from Staunton via
Charlottesville. If you have so understood it, you will be doing just
what I want. The direction I would now give is, that if this letter
reaches you in the valley between Staunton and Lynchburg, you
immediately turn east by the most practicable road until you strike the
Lynchburg branch of the Va. Central road. From thence move eastward
along the line of the road, destroying it completely and thoroughly,
until you join General Sheridan. After the work laid out for General
Sheridan and yourself is thoroughly done, proceed to join the Army of
the Potomac by the route laid out in General Sheridan’s
instructions.</p>
<p>If any portion of your force, especially your cavalry, is needed back
in your Department, you are authorized to send it back.</p>
<p>If on receipt of this you should be near to Lynchburg and deem it
practicable to reach that point, you will exercise your judgment about
going there.</p>
<p>If you should be on the railroad between Charlottesville and
Lynchburg, it may be practicable to detach a cavalry force to destroy
the canal. Lose no opportunity to destroy the canal.</p>
<p>U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>Lieut.-General.</p>
<p>3 FROM A STATEMENT OF LOSSES COMPILED IN THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL’S
OFFICE.</p>
<p>4 CITY POINT, VA., June 17, 1864 — 11 A.M.</p>
<p>MAJOR-GEN. HALLECK,</p>
<p>Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>The enemy in their endeavor to reinforce Petersburg abandoned their
intrenchments in front of Bermuda Hundred. They no doubt expected troops
from north of the James River to take their place before we discovered
it. General Butler took advantage of this and moved a force at once upon
the railroad and plank road between Richmond and Petersburg, which I
hope to retain possession of. Too much credit cannot be given to the
troops and their commanders for the energy and fortitude displayed
during the last five days. Day and night has been all the same, no
delays being allowed on any account.</p>
<p>U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>Lieut.-General.</p>
