<p>EXPEDITION AGAINST FORT FISHER — ATTACK ON THE FORT — FAILURE OF THE
EXPEDITION — SECOND EXPEDITION AGAINST THE FORT — CAPTURE OF FORT
FISHER</p>
<p>UP TO JANUARY, 1865, THE ENEMY OCCUPIED FORT FISHER, AT THE mouth of
Cape Fear River and below the City of Wilmington. This port was of
immense importance to the Confederates, because it formed their
principal inlet for blockade runners by means of which they brought in
from abroad such supplies and munitions of war as they could not produce
at home. It was equally important to us to get possession of it, not
only because it was desirable to cut off their supplies so as to insure
a speedy termination of the war, but also because foreign governments,
particularly the British Government, were constantly threatening that
unless ours could maintain the blockade of that coast they should cease
to recognize any blockade. For these reasons I determined, with the
concurrence of the Navy Department, in December, to send an expedition
against Fort Fisher for the purpose of capturing it.</p>
<p>To show the difficulty experienced in maintaining the blockade, I
will mention a circumstance that took place at Fort Fisher after its
fall. Two English blockade runners came in at night. Their commanders,
not supposing the fort had fallen, worked their way through all our
fleet and got into the river unobserved. They then signalled the fort,
announcing their arrival. There was a colored man in the fort who had
been there before and who understood these signals. He informed General
Terry what reply he should make to have them come in, and Terry did as
he advised. The vessels came in, their officers entirely unconscious
that they were falling into the hands of the Union forces. Even after
they were brought in to the fort they were entertained in conversation
for some little time before suspecting that the Union troops were
occupying the fort. They were finally informed that their vessels and
cargoes were prizes.</p>
<p>I selected General Weitzel, of the Army of the James, to go with the
expedition, but gave instructions through General Butler. He commanded
the department within whose geographical limits Fort Fisher was
situated, as well as Beaufort and other points on that coast held by our
troops; he was, therefore, entitled to the right of fitting out the
expedition against Fort Fisher.</p>
<p>General Butler conceived the idea that if a steamer loaded heavily
with powder could be run up to near the shore under the fort and
exploded, it would create great havoc and make the capture an easy
matter. Admiral Porter, who was to command the naval squadron, seemed to
fall in with the idea, and it was not disapproved of in Washington; the
navy was therefore given the task of preparing the steamer for this
purpose. I had no confidence in the success of the scheme, and so
expressed myself; but as no serious harm could come of the experiment,
and the authorities at Washington seemed desirous to have it tried, I
permitted it. The steamer was sent to Beaufort, North Carolina, and was
there loaded with powder and prepared for the part she was to play in
the reduction of Fort Fisher.</p>
<p>General Butler chose to go in command of the expedition himself, and
was all ready to sail by the 9th of December (1864). Very heavy storms
prevailed, however, at that time along that part of the sea-coast, and
prevented him from getting off until the 13th or 14th. His advance
arrived off Fort Fisher on the 15th. The naval force had been already
assembled, or was assembling, but they were obliged to run into Beaufort
for munitions, coal, etc.; then, too, the powder-boat was not yet fully
prepared. The fleet was ready to proceed on the 18th; but Butler, who
had remained outside from the 15th up to that time, now found himself
out of coal, fresh water, etc., and had to put into Beaufort to
replenish. Another storm overtook him, and several days more were lost
before the army and navy were both ready at the same time to
cooperate.</p>
<p>On the night of the 23d the powder-boat was towed in by a gunboat as
near to the fort as it was safe to run. She was then propelled by her
own machinery to within about five hundred yards of the shore. There the
clockwork, which was to explode her within a certain length of time, was
set and she was abandoned. Everybody left, and even the vessels put out
to sea to prevent the effect of the explosion upon them. At two o’clock
in the morning the explosion took place — and produced no more effect on
the fort, or anything else on land, than the bursting of a boiler
anywhere on the Atlantic Ocean would have done. Indeed when the troops
in Fort Fisher heard the explosion they supposed it was the bursting of
a boiler in one of the Yankee gunboats.</p>
<p>Fort Fisher was situated upon a low, flat peninsula north of Cape
Fear River. The soil is sandy. Back a little the peninsula is very
heavily wooded, and covered with fresh-water swamps. The fort ran across
this peninsula, about five hundred yards in width, and extended along
the sea coast about thirteen hundred yards. The fort had an armament of
21 guns and 3 mortars on the land side, and 24 guns on the sea front. At
that time it was only garrisoned by four companies of infantry, one
light battery and the gunners at the heavy guns — less than seven
hundred men — with a reserve of less than a thousand men five miles up
the peninsula. General Whiting of the Confederate army was in command,
and General Bragg was in command of the force at Wilmington. Both
commenced calling for reinforcements the moment they saw our troops
landing. The Governor of North Carolina called for everybody who could
stand behind a parapet and shoot a gun, to join them. In this way they
got two or three hundred additional men into Fort Fisher; and Hoke’s
division, five or six thousand strong, was sent down from Richmond. A
few of these troops arrived the very day that Butler was ready to
advance.</p>
<p>On the 24th the fleet formed for an attack in arcs of concentric
circles, their heavy iron-clads going in very close range, being nearest
the shore, and leaving intervals or spaces so that the outer vessels
could fire between them. Porter was thus enabled to throw one hundred
and fifteen shells per minute. The damage done to the fort by these
shells was very slight, only two or three cannon being disabled in the
fort. But the firing silenced all the guns by making it too hot for the
men to maintain their positions about them and compelling them to seek
shelter in the bomb-proofs.</p>
<p>On the next day part of Butler’s troops under General Adelbert Ames
effected a landing out of range of the fort without difficulty. This was
accomplished under the protection of gunboats sent for the purpose, and
under cover of a renewed attack upon the fort by the fleet. They formed
a line across the peninsula and advanced, part going north and part
toward the fort, covering themselves as they did so. Curtis pushed
forward and came near to Fort Fisher, capturing the small garrison at
what was called the Flag Pond Battery. Weitzel accompanied him to within
a half a mile of the works. Here he saw that the fort had not been
injured, and so reported to Butler, advising against an assault. Ames,
who had gone north in his advance, captured 228 of the reserves. These
prisoners reported to Butler that sixteen hundred of Hoke’s division of
six thousand from Richmond had already arrived and the rest would soon
be in his rear.</p>
<p>Upon these reports Butler determined to withdraw his troops from the
peninsula and return to the fleet. At that time there had not been a man
on our side injured except by one of the shells from the fleet. Curtis
had got within a few yards of the works. Some of his men had snatched a
flag from the parapet of the fort, and others had taken a horse from the
inside of the stockade. At night Butler informed Porter of his
withdrawal, giving the reasons above stated, and announced his purpose
as soon as his men could embark to start for Hampton Roads. Porter
represented to him that he had sent to Beaufort for more ammunition. He
could fire much faster than he had been doing, and would keep the enemy
from showing himself until our men were within twenty yards of the fort,
and he begged that Butler would leave some brave fellows like those who
had snatched the flag from the parapet and taken the horse from the
fort.</p>
<p>Butler was unchangeable. He got all his troops aboard, except
Curtis’s brigade, and started back. In doing this, Butler made a fearful
mistake. My instructions to him, or to the officer who went in command
of the expedition, were explicit in the statement that to effect a
landing would be of itself a great victory, and if one should be
effected, the foothold must not be relinquished; on the contrary, a
regular siege of the fort must be commenced and, to guard against
interference by reason of storms, supplies of provisions must be laid in
as soon as they could be got on shore. But General Butler seems to have
lost sight of this part of his instructions, and was back at Fort Monroe
on the 28th.</p>
<p>I telegraphed to the President as follows:</p>
<p>CITY POINT, VA.,</p>
<p>Dec. 28, 1864. — 8.30 P.M.</p>
<p>The Wilmington expedition has proven a gross and culpable failure.
Many of the troops are back here. Delays and free talk of the object of
the expedition enabled the enemy to move troops to Wilmington to defeat
it. After the expedition sailed from Fort Monroe, three days of fine
weather were squandered, during which the enemy was without a force to
protect himself. Who is to blame will, I hope, be known.</p>
<p>U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General.</p>
<p>Porter sent dispatches to the Navy Department in which he complained
bitterly of having been abandoned by the army just when the fort was
nearly in our possession, and begged that our troops might be sent back
again to cooperate, but with a different commander. As soon as I heard
this I sent a messenger to Porter with a letter asking him to hold on. I
assured him that I fully sympathized with him in his disappointment, and
that I would send the same troops back with a different commander, with
some reinforcements to offset those which the enemy had received. I told
him it would take some little time to get transportation for the
additional troops; but as soon as it could be had the men should be on
their way to him, and there would be no delay on my part. I selected A.
H. Terry to command.</p>
<p>It was the 6th of January before the transports could be got ready
and the troops aboard. They sailed from Fortress Monroe on that day. The
object and destination of the second expedition were at the time kept a
secret to all except a few in the Navy Department and in the army to
whom it was necessary to impart the information. General Terry had not
the slightest idea of where he was going or what he was to do. He simply
knew that he was going to sea and that he had his orders with him, which
were to be opened when out at sea.</p>
<p>He was instructed to communicate freely with Porter and have entire
harmony between army and navy, because the work before them would
require the best efforts of both arms of the service. They arrived off
Beaufort on the 8th. A heavy storm, however, prevented a landing at Fort
Fisher until the 13th. The navy prepared itself for attack about as
before, and at the same time assisted the army in landing, this time
five miles away. Only iron-clads fired at first; the object being to
draw the fire of the enemy’s guns so as to ascertain their positions.
This object being accomplished, they then let in their shots thick and
fast. Very soon the guns were all silenced, and the fort showed evident
signs of being much injured.</p>
<p>Terry deployed his men across the peninsula as had been done before,
and at two o’clock on the following morning was up within two miles of
the fort with a respectable abatis in front of his line. His artillery
was all landed on that day, the 14th. Again Curtis’s brigade of Ames’s
divison had the lead. By noon they had carried an unfinished work less
than a half mile from the fort, and turned it so as to face the other
way.</p>
<p>Terry now saw Porter and arranged for an assault on the following
day. The two commanders arranged their signals so that they could
communicate with each other from time to time as they might have
occasion. At daylight the fleet commenced its firing. The time agreed
upon for the assault was the middle of the afternoon, and Ames who
commanded the assaulting column moved at 3.30. Porter landed a force of
sailors and marines to move against the sea-front in cooperation with
Ames’s assault. They were under Commander Breese of the navy. These
sailors and marines had worked their way up to within a couple of
hundred yards of the fort before the assault. The signal was given and
the assault was made; but the poor sailors and marines were repulsed and
very badly handled by the enemy, losing 280 killed and wounded out of
their number.</p>
<p>Curtis’s brigade charged successfully though met by a heavy fire,
some of the men having to wade through the swamp up to their waists to
reach the fort. Many were wounded, of course, and some killed; but they
soon reached the palisades. These they cut away, and pushed on through.
The other troops then came up, Pennypacker’s following Curtis, and Bell,
who commanded the 3d brigade of Ames’s division, following Pennypacker.
But the fort was not yet captured though the parapet was gained.</p>
<p>The works were very extensive. The large parapet around the work
would have been but very little protection to those inside except when
they were close up under it. Traverses had, therefore, been run until
really the work was a succession of small forts enclosed by a large one.
The rebels made a desperate effort to hold the fort, and had to be
driven from these traverses one by one. The fight continued till long
after night. Our troops gained first one traverse and then another, and
by 10 o’clock at night the place was carried. During this engagement the
sailors, who had been repulsed in their assault on the bastion, rendered
the best service they could by reinforcing Terry’s northern line — thus
enabling him to send a detachment to the assistance of Ames. The fleet
kept up a continuous fire upon that part of the fort which was still
occupied by the enemy. By means of signals they could be informed where
to direct their shots.</p>
<p>During the succeeding nights the enemy blew up Fort Caswell on the
opposite side of Cape Fear River, and abandoned two extensive works on
Smith’s Island in the river.</p>
<p>Our captures in all amounted to 169 guns, besides small-arms, with
full supplies of ammunition, and 2,083 prisoners. In addition to these,
there were about 700 dead and wounded left there. We had lost 110 killed
and 536 wounded.</p>
<p>In this assault on Fort Fisher, Bell, one of the brigade commanders,
was killed, and two, Curtis and Pennypacker, were badly wounded.</p>
<p>Secretary Stanton, who was on his way back from Savannah, arrived off
Fort Fisher soon after it fell. When he heard the good news he promoted
all the officers of any considerable rank for their conspicuous
gallantry. Terry had been nominated for major-general, but had not been
confirmed. This confirmed him; and soon after I recommended him for a
brigadier-generalcy in the regular army, and it was given to him for
this victory.</p>
