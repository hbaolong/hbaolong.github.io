<p>The facsimiles of General Buckner’s dispatches at Fort Donelson are
copied from the originals furnished the publishers through the courtesy
of Mr. Ferdinand J. Dreer. General Grant’s dispatch, “I propose to move
immediately upon your works,” was copied from the original document in
the possession of the publishers.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>AFTER THREE DEADLY YEARS OF FIGHTING, PRESIDENT ABRAHAM Lincoln had
seen a little progress in the West against the Confederacy, but in the
main theater of operations, Virginia, the lines were almost exactly
where they had been when the American Civil War started. The war was at
a stalemate with northern public support rapidly fading. Then, Lincoln
summoned General Ulysses S. Grant to come East. In little over a year,
America’s most catastrophic armed conflict was ended, the Union was
preserved and slavery abolished. This book details how these triumphs
were achieved and in the telling earned international acclaim as a
superb example of an English-language personal chronicle. U. S. Grant’s
Personal Memoirs constitutes a vital historical and literary classic.
The book provides the reader with an understanding of the most perilous
four years in United States history and the best model for an entire
genre of literature.</p>
<p>Born Hiram Ulysses Grant in 1822, he remains one of the giants in
American history, revered and respected by his contemporaries, but
viewed ever after as one of the country’s most enigmatic and
controversial figures. Of modest, small-town midwestern origins, he
graduated from West Point in 1843 and was promoted for bravery during
the Mexican War, a conflict he denounced. He rose to command of the U.S.
Army during the Civil War and served as the 18th President of the United
States for two terms. All these grand accomplishments stand in stark
contrast with his equally enormous failures and disappointments. He was
forced into a military career by a father he disliked. As a cadet at the
military academy, he hated the institution so much he hoped for its
abolishment. He became an alcoholic in the early 1850s and a failed
businessman and farmer. As president, his administration is regarded as
one of the most corrupt in U.S. history. He lost his life savings in the
1880s and fell heavily into debt becoming dependent on friends and
family for handouts. While other prominent Americans look to publishing
their recollections as a crowning event undertaken in the leisure of
retirement, Grant had to write his 1885 memoir as a means to pay his
debts and feed, clothe, and shelter his family. Few Americans have
reached such highs–or plunged to such lows.</p>
<p>Grant’s reputation was shaped by some notable personality traits and
habits. The handful of contemporaries who had disparaging things to say
after first meeting him were usually put off by the general’s silence
following the initial greeting. He was naturally shy and reserved in
such encounters and rarely spoke more than a courteous and sometimes
formal salutation preferring the other party to carry the conversation.
Some incorrectly took this behavior as indicating a lack of intellect
and knowledge. Among long-time friends and acquaintances, he was
altogether a different man, talkative, amusing, and occasionally showing
his characteristic dry wit. Also, Grant was not a physically striking
figure. He was only five foot seven inches tall. While many officers of
his era adorned themselves with professionally tailored uniforms,
brilliantly colored sashes, and fancy swords, Grant was typically
unarmed, wore a standard drab soldier’s coat decorated only with the
government-issue shoulder boards appropriate to his rank. He was
trusting of others to a fault. Grant displayed no guile and was
remarkably honest. Unfortunately, he often assumed others were the same
and was consequently often deceived and cheated. He was also a voracious
reader of books and newspapers but only revealed his knowledge when it
was called for by the occasion, never to make a favorable impression. It
is understandable why some of those who only briefly knew him
characterized Grant as ignorant and slovenly.</p>
<p>Nothing led to more controversy about U. S. Grant than his reputation
as a drunkard. In modern terms, he was a managed alcoholic. A majority
of comments and memories on the subject from sixty-nine of his friends
and acquaintances place the beginning of serious problems during an
1852-1854 tour of duty as an Army captain in California. The causes are
generally ascribed to his having to leave his new wife, Julia, behind in
the East as well as the monotonous nature of the assignment. Lonely and
bored, Grant turned to the bottle for solace. His deportment was bad
enough to merit the threat of embarrassing disciplinary procedures.
Rather than face humiliation, he chose to resign his commission. Once he
returned to his wife, commentary about his drinking to excess became
infrequent. Forty-six of his friends and acquaintances remember Grant’s
Civil War and White House years as periods where he shunned alcohol for
three to four months at a time and was never was out of control when
serious matters were at hand. Twenty-three take a different view, saying
Grant’s addiction to drink was an occasional debilitating factor.
However, almost all agree that during those highly public years, Grant
was usually under the observation and direction of his wife or his
nagging chief of staff and friend, John Rawlings. In those conditions,
U. S. Grant was almost always cold sober. Additionally, the majority of
his friends and acquaintances state Grant rarely drank much alcohol.
But, they agreed that only a small amount made him intoxicated. Those
closest to him stated that Grant could snap out of an alcohol-induced
stupor after little more than an hour or two of sleep.</p>
<p>Perhaps the final word on Grant’s drinking should come from the man
who had the most to do with making him a leading national figure and the
bearer of awesome responsibilities. Abraham Lincoln heard all the
stories about Grant before promoting him to Lieutenant General. But the
president also took note of Grant’s accomplishments in the preceding
three years. In 1864 a few months after putting Grant in command of
Union forces, Lincoln said that Grant was the only real general that he
had. The rest of them had demanded the impossible from the White House.
The president said that he did not know Grant’s plans and did not want
to know. He knew Grant would take the necessary actions to defeat the
Confederacy. Alcoholic or not, Lincoln knew that Grant was a winner.</p>
<p>The chief cause of the mystery and mixed opinions about Grant is that
different generations of Americans have viewed him in dramatically
different ways. For most of his contemporaries, Grant was the kind,
considerate, and just general and president. Ex-Confederates were
surprisingly cordial toward him. In one telling post-war incident,
Robert E. Lee admonished and embarrassed a man who began denouncing
Grant. The ex-Confederate commander said that he would not permit such
remarks about Grant in his presence. The most widely circulated southern
publication among Confederate veterans printed nothing unkind or
critical of Grant. Union veterans were overwhelmingly favorable to their
former commander despite a few voices in the North claiming Grant had
been reckless with his soldiers’ lives at the battles of Vicksburg, the
Wilderness, and Cold Harbor. However, as the generation that knew him
began passing away, Grant’s reputation dived. Much of the cause of this
phenomenon had a decidedly political foundation. In the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries the Democratic Party began rebounding
after its disastrous flirtation with slavery interests. Americans were
often reminded of the Grant Administration’s corruption. At the same
time, the reputations of Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee were steadily
burnished and Grant’s repute suffered in the comparison. But the trend
in opinions reversed in the 1960s. The Civil War centennial ushered in a
new era of scholarly works about the conflict and its central
personalities. As accurate, fact-based, and well-reasoned books were
written, Grant’s stature grew as his admirable accomplishments were
revealed. His reputation has been on the upswing ever since.</p>
<p>In some measure, Grant’s revived stature stems from the remarkable
story of his struggle to write his memoirs. He began work on the memoir
in September 1884, after he was made financially destitute and
physically crippled. During the same month, he experienced severe pain
in his throat. The cause was diagnosed as an inoperable cancer. Knowing
he was dying, he threw himself into writing for the purpose of providing
for the love of his life, Julia Dent Grant, his wife of 36 years.
Writing with a pencil several hours a day, Grant was not only in a race
with death, he was struggling against an ever more intense and
incapacitating pain. From January through March 1885, the former
president was only able to get down pitifully small portions of food.
His body weight quickly went from 150 to 120 pounds. Publication of the
memoir was handled by his friend, the widely popular author Mark Twain.
Grant penciled in the finishing touches on July 19, 1885. Three days
later, death mercifully released him from the excruciating agony he had
endured for eleven months.</p>
<p>Despite its exorbitant price, the memoir was a huge financial
success. At the time, the average book price was about .50; U. S.
Grant’s Personal Memoirs with a cloth binding started at .00 per set and
reached 5.00 for the leather-bound, gilt-edge version. And, the memoir
was sold by subscription, each prospective owner having to place an
order with an authorized vendor. In today’s money, the cloth-bound set
would cost 17 and the leather-bound set would bring almost 00. The
vendors’ sales pitch solemnly reminded Americans that each citizen
should know the history of the country and that no event in the United
States was greater than the Civil War. The author, Grant, was
characterized to buyers as “the greatest actor” in the war. It all
worked. Across America, proud purchasers displayed the two volumes where
visitors would not miss them. Julia Grant received 50,000 from the
sales, an inflation-adjusted 2003 equivalent of more than ,000,000.
Debts were paid and the general’s widow and family looked forward to a
financially secure and comfortable life. Grant lost his battle with
cancer, but his struggle yielded his final triumph.</p>
<p>The book drew praise from the moment it was published. Mark Twain
described its distinguishing characteristics as “. . . clarity of
statement, directness, simplicity, manifest truthfulness, fairness and
justice . . .” Twain summed up his thoughts calling the Memoirs “. . . a
great, unique and unapproachable literary masterpiece.” The great
American political caricaturist Thomas Nash said, “He wrote as he
talked, simple, unadorned, manly.” The plaudits continued into the 20th
century. The biographer, Louis A. Coolidge, pictured Grant as a man who
“. . . had a faculty of narrative to an unusual degree.” The prominent
American editor, playwright and novelist, Edmund Wilson, said, “Perhaps
never has a book so objective in form seemed so personal in every line.”
And, “Somehow, despite its sobriety, it communicates the spirit of
battles themselves and makes it possible to understand how Grant won
them.” The applause has continued into the 21st century with the often
cynical and acerbic writer and playwright, Gore Vidal, saying: “It is
simply not possible to read Grant’s Memoirs without realizing that the
author is a man of first-rate intelligence.” Vidal described the book
simply as “a classic.”</p>
<p>Other than a consistent assertion of Grant’s faith in and respect for
the American soldier and sailor, the general did not attempt to thread
the book with an overall argument or theme. He thus avoided the writer’s
trap of yielding to the temptation to slant descriptions or omit
relevant facts to support a preconceived underlying concept. It was
Grant’s nature to keep strictly to facts, analyzing each strategy,
battle or campaign in the context of its own particular influences. Nor
did he have an “axe to grind.” Instead, he had a large body of
experience, facts and evidence to guide his account. He had copies of
his own orders, reports, and letters at hand. Grant did not have to
depend on memory alone.</p>
<p>This is a military memoir and some may suspect Grant chose to only
write of his experiences in the Mexican and Civil Wars so as to deflect
attention away from his troubled presidency. However, American
presidential memoirs are a twentieth, not a nineteenth century
phenomenon. On the other hand, the military memoir was well established
in Grant’s own time. The subject matter and organization of his memoirs
are almost identical to the approach taken by General Winfield Scott in
writing his 1864 two-volume memoir. Scott had sent Grant one of the
first sets of his career recollections and the two men met on several
occasions after the Civil War. Both books, Scott’s and Grant’s are
squarely centered on wartime personal experiences and the analysis of
the major armed conflicts carried out by the United States during their
periods of service.</p>
<p>Many well-qualified critics have judged Grant’s Memoirs to be a model
of clarity and in no need for explanation, but the reader will gain much
more from the book if consideration is given to factors the author did
not dwell on. Grant’s combat experience began in Mexico in 1846 and
ended in Virginia in 1865. In those nineteen years, the lethality and
range of weapons increased so dramatically that tactics changed from
close-packed Napoleonic linear formations to the World War I like trench
warfare seen on the Petersburg battlefield of 1864. The speed of
communications and transportation in 1865 afforded by telegraph and
railroad made it possible to receive reports about immediate events
hundreds of miles away within minutes of the occurrence and permitted
the dispatch of forces to cover about a hundred miles a day by rail.
Such capabilities were largely unknown less than twenty years before.
The reader should keep in mind that Grant and his contemporaries were
forced to adapt to revolutionary and onrushing technological change.
And, the dramatic change Grant experienced in the four years, 1861-
1865, must be appreciated. He begins the war as a regimental commander,
mainly concerned with drill formations and answering to generals about
keeping his men in line. He is promoted to Brigadier General and begins
commanding units of several hundred men, supervising a handful of
colonels. Promoted further, he is commanding organizations composed of
thousands and is directing subordinate generals. During the last year of
hostilities, he is promoted to Lieutenant General and is appointed as
General in Chief of all U.S. Armies. In four short years, Grant has gone
from tactics to strategy, from designing infantry attacks to planning
entire campaigns and from responding to brigadier generals to serving
the President of the United States. This account tells more than how
great feats were accomplished. In between the lines, there is another
story. The reader may discover how a single individual, Lincoln’s “only
general,” rose from a reputation of irresponsibility to be the man who
was entrusted with the fate of a nation. It is perhaps this unstated and
underlying quality that has made this book an American classic.</p>

<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>“MAN PROPOSES AND GOD DISPOSES.” THERE ARE BUT FEW IMPORTANT events
in the affairs of men brought about by their own choice.</p>
<p>Although frequently urged by friends to write my memoirs I had
determined never to do so, nor to write anything for publication. At the
age of nearly sixty-two I received an injury from a fall, which confined
me closely to the house while it did not apparently affect my general
health. This made study a pleasant pastime. Shortly after, the rascality
of a business partner developed itself by the announcement of a failure.
This was followed soon after by universal depression of all securities,
which seemed to threaten the extinction of a good part of the income
still retained, and for which I am indebted to the kindly act of
friends. At this juncture the editor of the Century Magazine asked me to
write a few articles for him. I consented for the money it gave me; for
at that moment I was living upon borrowed money. The work I found
congenial, and I determined to continue it. The event is an important
one for me, for good or evil; I hope for the former.</p>
<p>In preparing these volumes for the public, I have entered upon the
task with the sincere desire to avoid doing injustice to any one,
whether on the National or Confederate side, other than the unavoidable
injustice of not making mention often where special mention is due.
There must be many errors of omission in this work, because the subject
is too large to be treated of in two volumes in such way as to do
justice to all the officers and men engaged. There were thousands of
instances, during the rebellion, of individual, company, regimental and
brigade deeds of heroism which deserve special mention and are not here
alluded to. The troops engaged in them will have to look to the detailed
reports of their individual commanders for the full history of those
deeds.</p>
<p>The first volume, as well as a portion of the second, was written
before I had reason to suppose I was in a critical condition of health.
Later I was reduced almost to the point of death, and it became
impossible for me to attend to anything for weeks. I have, however,
somewhat regained my strength, and am able, often, to devote as many
hours a day as a person should devote to such work. I would have more
hope of satisfying the expectation of the public if I could have allowed
myself more time. I have used my best efforts, with the aid of my eldest
son, F. D. Grant, assisted by his brothers, to verify from the records
every statement of fact given. The comments are my own, and show how I
saw the matters treated of whether others saw them in the same light or
not.</p>
<p>With these remarks I present these volumes to the public, asking no
favor but hoping they will meet the approval of the reader.</p>
<p>U. S. GRANT.</p>
<p>MOUNT MACGREGOR, NEW YORK, July 1, 1885.</p>
