<h4 id="chapter-twenty-eight">CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT</h4>
<p>ADVANCE OF VAN DORN AND PRICE — PRICE ENTERS IUKA — BATTLE OF
IUKA</p>
<p>AT THIS TIME, SEPTEMBER 4TH, I HAD TWO DIVISIONS OF THE ARMY of the
Mississippi stationed at Corinth, Rienzi, Jacinto and Danville. There
were at Corinth also Davies’ division and two brigades of McArthur’s,
besides cavalry and artillery. This force constituted my left wing, of
which Rosecrans was in command. General Ord commanded the centre, from
Bethel to Humboldt on the Mobile and Ohio railroad and from Jackson to
Bolivar where the Mississippi Central is crossed by the Hatchie River.
General Sherman commanded on the right at Memphis with two of his
brigades back at Brownsville, at the crossing of the Hatchie River by
the Memphis and Ohio railroad. This made the most convenient arrangement
I could devise for concentrating all my spare forces upon any threatened
point. All the troops of the command were within telegraphic
communication of each other, except those under Sherman. By bringing a
portion of his command to Brownsville, from which point there was a
railroad and telegraph back to Memphis, communication could be had with
that part of my command within a few hours by the use of couriers. In
case it became necessary to reinforce Corinth, by this arrangement all
the troops at Bolivar, except a small guard, could be sent by rail by
the way of Jackson in less than twenty-four hours; while the troops from
Brownsville could march up to Bolivar to take their place.</p>
<p>On the 7th of September I learned of the advance of Van Dorn and
Price, apparently upon Corinth. One division was brought from Memphis to
Bolivar to meet any emergency that might arise from this move of the
enemy. I was much concerned because my first duty, after holding the
territory acquired within my command, was to prevent further reinforcing
of Bragg in Middle Tennessee. Already the Army of Northern Virginia had
defeated the army under General Pope and was invading Maryland. In the
Centre General Buell was on his way to Louisville and Bragg marching
parallel to him with a large Confederate force for the Ohio River.</p>
<p>I had been constantly called upon to reinforce Buell until at this
time my entire force numbered less than 50,000 men, of all arms. This
included everything from Cairo south within my jurisdiction. If I too
should be driven back, the Ohio River would become the line dividing the
belligerents west of the Alleghanies, while at the East the line was
already farther north than when hostilities commenced at the opening of
the war. It is true Nashville was never given up after its first
capture, but it would have been isolated and the garrison there would
have been obliged to beat a hasty retreat if the troops in West
Tennessee had been compelled to fall back. To say at the end of the
second year of the war the line dividing the contestants at the East was
pushed north of Maryland, a State that had not seceded, and at the West
beyond Kentucky, another State which had been always loyal, would have
been discouraging indeed. As it was, many loyal people despaired in the
fall of 1862 of ever saving the Union. The administration at Washington
was much concerned for the safety of the cause it held so dear. But I
believe there was never a day when the President did not think that, in
some way or other, a cause so just as ours would come out
triumphant.</p>
<p>Up to the 11th of September Rosecrans still had troops on the
railroad east of Corinth, but they had all been ordered in. By the 12th
all were in except a small force under Colonel Murphy of the 8th
Wisconsin. He had been detained to guard the remainder of the stores
which had not yet been brought in to Corinth.</p>
<p>On the 13th of September General Sterling Price entered Iuka, a town
about twenty miles east of Corinth on the Memphis and Charleston
railroad. Colonel Murphy with a few men was guarding the place. He made
no resistance, but evacuated the town on the approach of the enemy. I
was apprehensive lest the object of the rebels might be to get troops
into Tennessee to reinforce Bragg, as it was afterwards ascertained to
be. The authorities at Washington, including the general-in-chief of the
army, were very anxious, as I have said, about affairs both in East and
Middle Tennessee; and my anxiety was quite as great on their account as
for any danger threatening my command. I had not force enough at Corinth
to attack Price even by stripping everything; and there was danger that
before troops could be got from other points he might be far on his way
across the Tennessee. To prevent this all spare forces at Bolivar and
Jackson were ordered to Corinth, and cars were concentrated at Jackson
for their transportation. Within twenty-four hours from the transmission
of the order the troops were at their destination, although there had
been a delay of four hours resulting from the forward train getting off
the track and stopping all the others. This gave a reinforcement of near
8,000 men, General Ord in command. General Rosecrans commanded the
district of Corinth with a movable force of about 9,000, independent of
the garrison deemed necessary to be left behind. It was known that
General Van Dorn was about a four days’ march south of us, with a large
force. It might have been part of his plan to attack at Corinth, Price
coming from the east while he came up from the south. My desire was to
attack Price before Van Dorn could reach Corinth or go to his
relief.</p>
<p>General Rosecrans had previously had his headquarters at Iuka, where
his command was spread out along the Memphis and Charleston railroad
eastward. While there he had a most excellent map prepared showing all
the roads and streams in the surrounding country. He was also personally
familiar with the ground, so that I deferred very much to him in my
plans for the approach. We had cars enough to transport all of General
Ord’s command, which was to go by rail to Burnsville, a point on the
road about seven miles west of Iuka. From there his troops were to march
by the north side of the railroad and attack Price from the north-west,
while Rosecrans was to move eastward from his position south of Corinth
by way of the Jacinto road. A small force was to hold the Jacinto road
where it turns to the north-east, while the main force moved on the
Fulton road which comes into Iuka further east. This plan was suggested
by Rosecrans.</p>
<p>Bear Creek, a few miles to the east of the Fulton road, is a
formidable obstacle to the movement of troops in the absence of bridges,
all of which, in September, 1862, had been destroyed in that vicinity.
The Tennessee, to the north-east, not many miles away, was also a
formidable obstacle for an army followed by a pursuing force. Ord was on
the north-west, and even if a rebel movement had been possible in that
direction it could have brought only temporary relief, for it would have
carried Price’s army to the rear of the National forces and isolated it
from all support. It looked to me that, if Price would remain in Iuka
until we could get there, his annihilation was inevitable.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 18th of September General Ord moved by rail to
Burnsville, and there left the cars and moved out to perform his part of
the programme. He was to get as near the enemy as possible during the
day and intrench himself so as to hold his position until the next
morning. Rosecrans was to be up by the morning of the 19th on the two
roads before described, and the attack was to be from all three quarters
simultaneously. Troops enough were left at Jacinto and Rienzi to detain
any cavalry that Van Dorn might send out to make a sudden dash into
Corinth until I could be notified. There was a telegraph wire along the
railroad, so there would be no delay in communication. I detained cars
and locomotives enough at Burnsville to transport the whole of Ord’s
command at once, and if Van Dorn had moved against Corinth instead of
Iuka I could have thrown in reinforcements to the number of 7,000 or
8,000 before he could have arrived. I remained at Burnsville with a
detachment of about 900 men from Ord’s command and communicated with my
two wings by courier. Ord met the advance of the enemy soon after
leaving Burnsville. Quite a sharp engagement ensued, but he drove the
rebels back with considerable loss, including one general officer
killed. He maintained his position and was ready to attack by daylight
the next morning. I was very much disappointed at receiving a dispatch
from Rosecrans after midnight from Jacinto, twenty-two miles from Iuka,
saying that some of his command had been delayed, and that the rear of
his column was not yet up as far as Jacinto. He said, however, that he
would still be at Iuka by two o’clock the next day. I did not believe
this possible because of the distance and the condition of the roads,
which was bad; besides, troops after a forced march of twenty miles are
not in a good condition for fighting the moment they get through. It
might do in marching to relieve a beleaguered garrison, but not to make
an assault. I immediately sent Ord a copy of Rosecrans’ dispatch and
ordered him to be in readiness to attack the moment he heard the sound
of guns to the south or south-east. He was instructed to notify his
officers to be on the alert for any indications of battle. During the
19th the wind blew in the wrong direction to transmit sound either
towards the point where Ord was, or to Burnsville where I had
remained.</p>
<p>A couple of hours before dark on the 19th Rosecrans arrived with the
head of his column at Barnets, the point where the Jacinto road to Iuka
leaves the road going east. He here turned north without sending any
troops to the Fulton road. While still moving in column up the Jacinto
road he met a force of the enemy and had his advance badly beaten and
driven back upon the main road. In this short engagement his loss was
considerable for the number engaged, and one battery was taken from him.
The wind was still blowing hard and in the wrong direction to transmit
sound towards either Ord or me. Neither he nor I nor any one in either
command heard a gun that was fired upon the battle-field. After the
engagement Rosecrans sent me a dispatch announcing the result. This was
brought by a courier. There was no road between Burnsville and the
position then occupied by Rosecrans and the country was impassable for a
man on horseback. The courier bearing the message was compelled to move
west nearly to Jacinto before he found a road leading to Burnsville.
This made it a late hour of the night before I learned of the battle
that had taken place during the afternoon. I at once notified Ord of the
fact and ordered him to attack early in the morning. The next morning
Rosecrans himself renewed the attack and went into Iuka with but little
resistance. Ord also went in according to orders, without hearing a gun
from the south of town but supposing the troops coming from the
south-west must be up by that time. Rosecrans, however, had put no
troops upon the Fulton road, and the enemy had taken advantage of this
neglect and retreated by that road during the night. Word was soon
brought to me that our troops were in Iuka. I immediately rode into town
and found that the enemy was not being pursued even by the cavalry. I
ordered pursuit by the whole of Rosecrans’ command and went on with him
a few miles in person. He followed only a few miles after I left him and
then went into camp, and the pursuit was continued no further. I was
disappointed at the result of the battle of Iuka — but I had so high an
opinion of General Rosecrans that I found no fault at the time.</p>
