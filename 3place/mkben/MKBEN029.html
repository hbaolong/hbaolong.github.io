<h4 id="act-4-scene-3">Act 4 Scene 3</h4>
<p>running scene 17</p>
<p>Enter Malcolm and Macduff</p>
<p>MALCOLM Let us seek out some desolate shade1, and there</p>
<p>Weep our sad bosoms empty.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Let us rather</p>
<p>Hold fast the mortal4 sword, and like good men</p>
<p>Bestride our downfall birthdom.5 Each new morn</p>
<p>New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows</p>
<p>Strike heaven on the face, that7 it resounds</p>
<p>As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out</p>
<p>Like syllable of dolour.9</p>
<p>MALCOLM What I believe I’ll wail10;</p>
<p>What know, believe; and what I can redress,</p>
<p>As I shall find the time to friend12, I will.</p>
<p>What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.13</p>
<p>This tyrant, whose sole name14 blisters our tongues,</p>
<p>Was once thought honest.15 You have loved him well:</p>
<p>He hath not touched you yet. I am young, but something16</p>
<p>You may discern of him through me, and wisdom17</p>
<p>To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb</p>
<p>T’appease an angry god.19</p>
<p>MACDUFF I am not treacherous.</p>
<p>MALCOLM But Macbeth is.</p>
<p>A good and virtuous nature may recoil22</p>
<p>In an imperial charge.23 But I shall crave your pardon:</p>
<p>That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose24;</p>
<p>Angels are bright still, though the brightest25 fell:</p>
<p>Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace26,</p>
<p>Yet grace must still look so.27</p>
<p>MACDUFF I have lost my hopes.</p>
<p>MALCOLM Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.29</p>
<p>Why in that rawness30 left you wife and child,</p>
<p>Those precious motives31, those strong knots of love,</p>
<p>Without leave-taking?32 I pray you,</p>
<p>Let not my jealousies be your dishonours33,</p>
<p>But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,</p>
<p>Whatever I shall think.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Bleed, bleed, poor country!</p>
<p>Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure37,</p>
<p>For goodness dare not check38 thee: wear thou thy wrongs,</p>
<p>The title is affeered!39— Fare thee well, lord.</p>
<p>I would not be the villain that thou think’st</p>
<p>For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp,</p>
<p>And the rich east to boot.42</p>
<p>MALCOLM Be not offended:</p>
<p>I speak not as in absolute fear of you.</p>
<p>I think our country sinks beneath the yoke45:</p>
<p>It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash</p>
<p>Is added to her wounds. I think withal47</p>
<p>There would be hands uplifted in my right48,</p>
<p>And here from gracious England49 have I offer</p>
<p>Of goodly thousands50: but, for all this,</p>
<p>When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,</p>
<p>Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country</p>
<p>Shall have more vices than it had before,</p>
<p>More suffer, and more sundry54 ways than ever,</p>
<p>By him that shall succeed.55</p>
<p>MACDUFF What56 should he be?</p>
<p>MALCOLM It is myself I mean, in whom I know</p>
<p>All the particulars of vice so grafted58</p>
<p>That, when they shall be opened59, black Macbeth</p>
<p>Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state</p>
<p>Esteem61 him as a lamb, being compared</p>
<p>With my confineless62 harms.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Not in the legions63</p>
<p>Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned</p>
<p>In evils to top65 Macbeth.</p>
<p>MALCOLM I grant him bloody,</p>
<p>Luxurious, avaricious67, false, deceitful,</p>
<p>Sudden68, malicious, smacking of every sin</p>
<p>That has a name, but there’s no bottom, none,</p>
<p>In my voluptuousness70: your wives, your daughters,</p>
<p>Your matrons and your maids71, could not fill up</p>
<p>The cistern72 of my lust, and my desire</p>
<p>All continent impediments would o’erbear73</p>
<p>That did oppose my will.74 Better Macbeth</p>
<p>Than such an one to reign.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Boundless intemperance76</p>
<p>In nature is a tyranny: it hath been</p>
<p>Th’untimely emptying of the happy throne</p>
<p>And fall of many kings. But fear not yet</p>
<p>To take upon you what is yours80: you may</p>
<p>Convey81 your pleasures in a spacious plenty,</p>
<p>And yet seem cold. The time you may so hoodwink.82</p>
<p>We have willing dames enough: there cannot be</p>
<p>That vulture in you to devour so many84</p>
<p>As will to greatness dedicate themselves,</p>
<p>Finding it so inclined.</p>
<p>MALCOLM With this there grows</p>
<p>In my most ill-composed affection88 such</p>
<p>A stanchless89 avarice that, were I king,</p>
<p>I should cut off90 the nobles for their lands,</p>
<p>Desire his91 jewels and this other’s house:</p>
<p>And my more-having92 would be as a sauce</p>
<p>To make me hunger more, that I should forge93</p>
<p>Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,</p>
<p>Destroying them for wealth.</p>
<p>MACDUFF This avarice</p>
<p>Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root</p>
<p>Than summer-seeming98 lust, and it hath been</p>
<p>The sword of our slain kings.99 Yet do not fear:</p>
<p>Scotland hath foisons100 to fill up your will</p>
<p>Of your mere own. All these are portable101,</p>
<p>With other graces weighed.102</p>
<p>MALCOLM But I have none. The king-becoming103 graces,</p>
<p>As justice, verity, temp’rance104, stableness,</p>
<p>Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness105,</p>
<p>Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,</p>
<p>I have no relish of them, but abound107</p>
<p>In the division of each several108 crime,</p>
<p>Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should</p>
<p>Pour the sweet milk of concord110 into hell,</p>
<p>Uproar111 the universal peace, confound</p>
<p>All unity on earth.</p>
<p>MACDUFF O Scotland, Scotland!</p>
<p>MALCOLM If such a one be fit to govern, speak:</p>
<p>I am as I have spoken.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Fit to govern?</p>
<p>No, not to live. O nation miserable,</p>
<p>With an untitled118 tyrant bloody-sceptred,</p>
<p>When shalt thou see thy wholesome119 days again,</p>
<p>Since that the truest issue of thy throne</p>
<p>By his own interdiction121 stands accused</p>
<p>And does blaspheme his breed?122— Thy royal father</p>
<p>Was a most sainted123 king: the queen that bore thee,</p>
<p>Oft’ner upon her knees124 than on her feet,</p>
<p>Died every day she lived.125 Fare thee well.</p>
<p>These evils thou repeat’st upon126 thyself</p>
<p>Hath banished me from Scotland.127— O my breast,</p>
<p>Thy hope ends here!</p>
<p>MALCOLM Macduff, this noble passion,</p>
<p>Child of integrity, hath from my soul</p>
<p>Wiped the black scruples131, reconciled my thoughts</p>
<p>To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth</p>
<p>By many of these trains133 hath sought to win me</p>
<p>Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks134 me</p>
<p>From over-credulous135 haste: but God above</p>
<p>Deal between thee and me! For even now</p>
<p>I put myself to thy direction137 and</p>
<p>Unspeak mine own detraction: here abjure138</p>
<p>The taints139 and blames I laid upon myself</p>
<p>For140 strangers to my nature. I am yet</p>
<p>Unknown to woman, never was forsworn141,</p>
<p>Scarcely have coveted what was mine own142,</p>
<p>At no time broke my faith, would not betray</p>
<p>The devil to his fellow, and delight</p>
<p>No less in truth than life. My first false speaking145</p>
<p>Was this upon myself.146 What I am truly</p>
<p>Is thine and my poor country’s to command:</p>
<p>Whither indeed, before thy here-approach148,</p>
<p>Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men,</p>
<p>Already at a point150, was setting forth.</p>
<p>Now we’ll together, and the chance of goodness151</p>
<p>Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?</p>
<p>MACDUFF Such welcome and unwelcome things at once</p>
<p>’Tis hard to reconcile.</p>
<p>Enter a Doctor</p>
<p>MALCOLM Well, more anon.— Comes the king forth, I pray you?</p>
<p>DOCTOR Ay, sir, there are a crew of wretched souls</p>
<p>That stay his cure: their malady convinces157</p>
<p>The great assay of art158, but at his touch —</p>
<p>Such sanctity159 hath heaven given his hand —</p>
<p>They presently amend.160</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>MALCOLM I thank you, doctor.</p>
<p>MACDUFF What’s the disease he means?</p>
<p>MALCOLM ’Tis called the evil163:</p>
<p>A most miraculous work in this good king,</p>
<p>Which often, since my here-remain165 in England,</p>
<p>I have seen him do. How he solicits166 heaven</p>
<p>Himself best knows: but strangely-visited167 people,</p>
<p>All swoll’n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,</p>
<p>The mere169 despair of surgery, he cures,</p>
<p>Hanging a golden stamp170 about their necks</p>
<p>Put on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken171,</p>
<p>To the succeeding royalty172 he leaves</p>
<p>The healing benediction. With this strange173 virtue</p>
<p>He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,</p>
<p>And sundry blessings hang about his throne</p>
<p>That speak him176 full of grace.</p>
<p>Enter Ross</p>
<p>MACDUFF See who comes here.</p>
<p>MALCOLM My countryman, but yet I know178 him not.</p>
<p>MACDUFF My ever-gentle179 cousin, welcome hither.</p>
<p>MALCOLM I know him now. Good God betimes180 remove</p>
<p>The means181 that makes us strangers!</p>
<p>ROSS Sir, amen.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Stands Scotland where it did?</p>
<p>ROSS Alas, poor country,</p>
<p>Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot</p>
<p>Be called our mother, but our grave; where nothing186</p>
<p>But who knows nothing is once seen to smile:</p>
<p>Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air</p>
<p>Are made, not marked189: where violent sorrow seems</p>
<p>A modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell190</p>
<p>Is there scarce asked for who, and good men’s lives</p>
<p>Expire before the flowers in their caps,</p>
<p>Dying or ere they sicken.193</p>
<p>MACDUFF O, relation too nice194, and yet too true!</p>
<p>MALCOLM What’s the newest grief?</p>
<p>ROSS That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker196:</p>
<p>Each minute teems197 a new one.</p>
<p>MACDUFF How does my wife?</p>
<p>ROSS Why, well.</p>
<p>MACDUFF And all my children?</p>
<p>ROSS Well, too.</p>
<p>MACDUFF The tyrant has not battered at their peace?</p>
<p>ROSS No, they were well at peace203 when I did leave em.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Be not a niggard of204 your speech: how goes’t?</p>
<p>ROSS When I came hither to transport the tidings</p>
<p>Which I have heavily206 borne, there ran a rumour</p>
<p>Of many worthy fellows that were out207,</p>
<p>Which was to my belief witnessed the rather208,</p>
<p>For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.209</p>
<p>To Malcolm</p>
<p>Now is the time of help.— Your eye210 in Scotland</p>
<p>Would create soldiers, make our women fight,</p>
<p>To doff212 their dire distresses.</p>
<p>MALCOLM Be’t213 their comfort</p>
<p>We are coming thither. Gracious England hath</p>
<p>Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men:</p>
<p>An older and a better soldier none216</p>
<p>That Christendom gives out.217</p>
<p>ROSS Would I could answer</p>
<p>This comfort with the like.219 But I have words</p>
<p>That would be howled out in the desert220 air,</p>
<p>Where hearing should not latch221 them.</p>
<p>MACDUFF What concern they?</p>
<p>The general cause? Or is it a fee-grief223</p>
<p>Due to some single breast?</p>
<p>ROSS No mind that’s honest</p>
<p>But in it shares some woe, though the main part</p>
<p>Pertains to you alone.</p>
<p>MACDUFF If it be mine,</p>
<p>Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.</p>
<p>ROSS Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,</p>
<p>Which shall possess them with the heaviest231 sound</p>
<p>That ever yet they heard.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Hum! I guess at it.</p>
<p>ROSS Your castle is surprised234, your wife and babes</p>
<p>Savagely slaughtered: to relate the manner235</p>
<p>Were, on the quarry of these murdered deer236,</p>
<p>To add the death of you.</p>
<p>MALCOLM Merciful heaven!</p>
<p>What, man, ne’er pull your hat upon your brows239:</p>
<p>Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak</p>
<p>Whispers the o’er-fraught241 heart and bids it break.</p>
<p>MACDUFF My children too?</p>
<p>ROSS Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.</p>
<p>MACDUFF And I must be from thence!244 My wife killed too?</p>
<p>ROSS I have said.</p>
<p>MALCOLM Be comforted:</p>
<p>Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge,</p>
<p>To cure this deadly grief.</p>
<p>MACDUFF He249 has no children.— All my pretty ones?</p>
<p>Did you say all? O hell-kite!250 All?</p>
<p>What, all my pretty chickens and their dam251</p>
<p>At one fell swoop?252</p>
<p>MALCOLM Dispute253 it like a man.</p>
<p>MACDUFF I shall do so,</p>
<p>But I must also feel it as a man:</p>
<p>I cannot but remember such things were</p>
<p>That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on</p>
<p>And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,</p>
<p>They were all struck for thee! Naught259 that I am,</p>
<p>Not for their own demerits260, but for mine,</p>
<p>Fell261 slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!</p>
<p>MALCOLM Be this the whetstone262 of your sword. Let grief</p>
<p>Convert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it.</p>
<p>MACDUFF O, I could play the woman with mine eyes264</p>
<p>And braggart265 with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,</p>
<p>Cut short all intermission. Front to front266</p>
<p>Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself:</p>
<p>Within my sword’s length set him. If he scape268,</p>
<p>Heaven forgive him too!</p>
<p>MALCOLM This tune270 goes manly.</p>
<p>Come, go we to the king. Our power271 is ready:</p>
<p>Our lack is nothing but our leave.272 Macbeth</p>
<p>Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above273</p>
<p>Put on their instruments.274 Receive what cheer you may:</p>
<p>The night is long that never finds the day.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
