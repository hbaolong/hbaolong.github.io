<p>running scene 23 continues</p>
<p>Enter Macbeth</p>
<p>MACBETH They have tied me to a stake: I cannot fly,</p>
<p>But bear-like I must fight the course.2 What’s he</p>
<p>That was not born of woman? Such a one</p>
<p>Am I to fear, or none.</p>
<p>Enter Young Siward</p>
<p>YOUNG SIWARD What is thy name?</p>
<p>MACBETH Thou’lt be afraid to hear it.</p>
<p>YOUNG SIWARD No, though thou call’st thyself a hotter name</p>
<p>Than any is8 in hell.</p>
<p>MACBETH My name’s Macbeth.</p>
<p>YOUNG SIWARD The devil himself could not pronounce a title</p>
<p>More hateful to mine ear.</p>
<p>MACBETH No, nor more fearful.</p>
<p>YOUNG SIWARD Thou liest, abhorrèd tyrant: with my sword</p>
<p>I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.</p>
<p>Fight and Young Siward slain</p>
<p>MACBETH Thou wast born of woman.</p>
<p>But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,</p>
<p>Brandished by man that’s of a woman born.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Alarums. Enter Macduff</p>
<p>MACDUFF That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face.</p>
<p>If thou be’st slain, and with no stroke of mine,</p>
<p>My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.</p>
<p>I cannot strike at wretched kerns21, whose arms</p>
<p>Are hired to bear their staves22: either thou, Macbeth,</p>
<p>Or else my sword with an unbattered edge</p>
<p>I sheathe again undeeded.24 There thou shouldst be:</p>
<p>By this great clatter, one of greatest note25</p>
<p>Seems bruited.26 Let me find him, Fortune,</p>
<p>And more I beg not.</p>
<p>Exit. Alarums</p>
<p>Enter Malcolm and Siward</p>
<p>SIWARD This way, my lord. The castle’s gently rendered28:</p>
<p>The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight,</p>
<p>The noble thanes do bravely in the war,</p>
<p>The day almost itself professes yours31,</p>
<p>And little is to do.</p>
<p>MALCOLM We have met with foes that strike beside us.33</p>
<p>SIWARD Enter, sir, the castle.</p>
<p>Exeunt. Alarum</p>
<p>Enter Macbeth</p>
<p>MACBETH Why should I play the Roman fool and die35</p>
<p>On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives36, the gashes</p>
<p>Do better upon them.</p>
<p>Enter Macduff</p>
<p>MACDUFF Turn, hell-hound, turn.</p>
<p>MACBETH Of all men else39 I have avoided thee.</p>
<p>But get thee back: my soul is too much charged40</p>
<p>With blood of thine already.</p>
<p>MACDUFF I have no words:</p>
<p>My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain</p>
<p>Fight. Alarum</p>
<p>Than terms can give thee out.44</p>
<p>MACBETH Thou losest labour.45</p>
<p>As easy mayst thou the intrenchant46 air</p>
<p>With thy keen sword impress47 as make me bleed.</p>
<p>Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests48:</p>
<p>I bear a charmèd life, which must not yield</p>
<p>To one of woman born.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Despair thy charm,</p>
<p>And let the angel52 whom thou still hast served</p>
<p>Tell thee: Macduff was from his mother’s womb</p>
<p>Untimely54 ripped.</p>
<p>MACBETH Accursèd be that tongue that tells me so,</p>
<p>For it hath cowed my better part of man.56</p>
<p>And be these juggling57 fiends no more believed</p>
<p>That palter58 with us in a double sense,</p>
<p>That keep the word of promise to our ear59</p>
<p>And break it to our hope. I’ll not fight with thee.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Then yield thee, coward,</p>
<p>And live to be the show and gaze o’th’time62:</p>
<p>We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,</p>
<p>Painted upon a pole, and underwrit64,</p>
<p>‘Here may you see the tyrant.’</p>
<p>MACBETH I will not yield</p>
<p>To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet</p>
<p>And to be baited with the rabble68’s curse.</p>
<p>Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane,</p>
<p>And thou opposed70, being of no woman born,</p>
<p>Yet I will try the last.71 Before my body</p>
<p>I throw my warlike shield. Lay on72, Macduff,</p>
<p>And damned be him that first cries, ‘Hold, enough!’</p>
<p>Exeunt fighting. Alarums</p>
<p>Enter fighting, and Macbeth slain</p>
<p>[Exit Macduff with Macbeth’s body]</p>
<p>Retreat and flourish. Enter, with Drum and Colours, Malcolm, Siward,
Ross, Thanes and Soldiers</p>
<p>MALCOLM I would74 the friends we miss were safe arrived.</p>
<p>SIWARD Some must go off: and yet, by these75 I see</p>
<p>So great a day as this is cheaply bought.</p>
<p>MALCOLM Macduff is missing, and your noble son.</p>
<p>To Siward</p>
<p>ROSS Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt78:</p>
<p>He only lived but till he was a man,</p>
<p>The which no sooner had his prowess80 confirmed</p>
<p>In the unshrinking station81 where he fought,</p>
<p>But like a man he died.</p>
<p>SIWARD Then he is dead?</p>
<p>ROSS Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow</p>
<p>Must not be measured by his worth, for then</p>
<p>It hath no end.</p>
<p>SIWARD Had he his hurts before?87</p>
<p>ROSS Ay, on the front.</p>
<p>SIWARD Why then, God’s soldier be he!</p>
<p>Had I as many sons as I have hairs90</p>
<p>I would not wish them to a fairer death:</p>
<p>And so his knell is knolled.92</p>
<p>MALCOLM He’s worth more sorrow,</p>
<p>And that I’ll spend94 for him.</p>
<p>SIWARD He’s worth no more.</p>
<p>They say he parted well and paid his score96,</p>
<p>And so God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.</p>
<p>Enter Macduff with Macbeth’s head</p>
<p>MACDUFF Hail, king, for so thou art. Behold where stands98</p>
<p>Th’usurper’s cursèd head. The time is free99:</p>
<p>I see thee compassed with thy kingdom’s pearl100,</p>
<p>That speak my salutation101 in their minds,</p>
<p>Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:</p>
<p>Hail, King of Scotland!</p>
<p>ALL Hail, King of Scotland!</p>
<p>Flourish</p>
<p>MALCOLM We shall not spend105 a large expense of time</p>
<p>Before we reckon106 with your several loves</p>
<p>And make us even with you.107 My thanes and kinsmen,</p>
<p>Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland</p>
<p>In such an honour named. What’s more to do</p>
<p>Which would be planted newly with the time110,</p>
<p>As calling home our exiled friends abroad</p>
<p>That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,</p>
<p>Producing forth the cruel ministers113</p>
<p>Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,</p>
<p>Who — as ’tis thought — by self and violent115 hands</p>
<p>Took off her life: this, and what needful else116</p>
<p>That calls upon us, by the grace of grace117</p>
<p>We will perform in measure118, time and place.</p>
<p>So thanks to all at once and to each one,</p>
<p>Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt</p>
<p>The Songs (apparently by Thomas Middleton, used in stagings after
Shakespeare’s retirement)</p>
<p>Song 1: at end of 3.5:</p>
<p>Above</p>
<p>UNSEEN SPIRITS Come away, come away,</p>
<p>Hecate, Hecate, O come away!</p>
<p>HECATE I come, I come, I come, I come,</p>
<p>With all the speed I may,</p>
<p>With all the speed I may.</p>
<p>Where’s Stadlin?</p>
<p>UNSEEN SPIRIT Here.</p>
<p>HECATE Where’s Puckle?</p>
<p>UNSEEN SPIRIT Here.</p>
<p>UNSEEN SPIRITS And Hoppo too, and Hellway too,</p>
<p>We lack but you, we lack but you.</p>
<p>Come away, make up the count.12</p>
<p>HECATE I will but ’noint13, and then I mount.</p>
<p>I will but ’noint, and then I mount.</p>
<p>Malkin, a spirit like a cat, descends</p>
<p>UNSEEN SPIRITS Here comes one down to fetch his dues15,</p>
<p>A kiss, a cull16, a sip of blood,</p>
<p>And why thou stay’st so long I muse17, I muse,</p>
<p>Since the air’s so fresh and good.</p>
<p>HECATE O, art thou come? What news, what news?</p>
<p>MALKIN All goes well to our delight:</p>
<p>Either come or else</p>
<p>Refuse, refuse.</p>
<p>Going up</p>
<p>HECATE Now I am furnished23 for the flight.</p>
<p>Now I go, O now I fly,</p>
<p>Malkin my sweet spirit and I.</p>
<p>O what a dainty pleasure is this</p>
<p>To ride in the air</p>
<p>When the moon shines fair,</p>
<p>And feast and sing and toy and kiss!</p>
<p>Over woods, high rocks and mountains,</p>
<p>Over seas, our crystal31 fountains,</p>
<p>Over steeples, towers, turrets,</p>
<p>We fly by night ’mongst troops of spirits:</p>
<p>No ring of bells to our ears sound34,</p>
<p>No howls of wolves, nor yelps of hounds,</p>
<p>No, nor the noise of water’s breach36,</p>
<p>Nor cannon’s throat our height can reach.</p>
<p>UNSEEN SPIRITS No ring of bells to our ears sound,</p>
<p>No howls of wolves, nor yelps of hounds,</p>
<p>No, nor the noise of water’s breach,</p>
<p>Nor cannon’s throat our height can reach.</p>
<p>[Exeunt]</p>
<p>Song 2: in 4.1, before Macbeth’s entrance:</p>
<p>HECATE Black spirits and white, red spirits and grey,</p>
<p>Mingle, mingle, mingle, you that mingle may.</p>
<p>FOURTH WITCH Titty, Tiffin, keep it stiff in3,</p>
<p>Firedrake, Puckey, make it lucky,</p>
<p>Liard, Robin, you must bob in.</p>
<p>ALL Round, around, around, about, about,</p>
<p>All ill come running in, all good keep out.</p>
<p>FOURTH WITCH Here’s the blood of a bat.</p>
<p>HECATE Put in that, O put in that!</p>
<p>FIFTH WITCH Here’s leopard’s bane.10</p>
<p>HECATE Put in a grain.</p>
<p>FOURTH WITCH The juice of toad, the oil12 of adder.</p>
<p>FIFTH WITCH Those will make the charm grow madder.13</p>
<p>HECATE Put in, there’s all, and rid14 the stench.</p>
<p>SIXTH WITCH Nay, here’s three ounces of a red-haired wench.15</p>
<p>ALL Round, around, around, about, about,</p>
<p>All ill come running in, all good keep out.</p>

<p>SCENE-BY-SCENE ANALYSIS</p>
<p>ACT 1 SCENE 1</p>
<p>The three weyard sisters arrange to appear to Macbeth later,
introducing the supernatural element to the play and establishing a
dark, malevolent tone. Their chant of “Fair is foul, and foul is fair”
introduces inverted values and the storm invokes nature in disorder.</p>
<p>ACT 1 SCENE 2</p>
<p>An injured captain reports on the battle with the rebel Macdonald. He
describes “valiant” Macbeth’s brave but violent slaying of Macdonald as
he “unseamed him from the nave to th’chops.” Ross brings news of
Macdonald’s Norwegian allies, reporting that they had “terrible numbers”
and were assisted by the Thane of Cawdor, traitor against King Duncan,
but were defeated by “Bellona’s bridegroom”—Macbeth. Duncan pronounces
that Cawdor is to be executed and Macbeth is to have his title,
ironically asserting that “No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive /
Our bosom interest.”</p>
<p>ACT 1 SCENE 3</p>
<p>Lines 1–38: The three weyard sisters reveal their cruel natures as
they wait. They hear Macbeth coming and work a spell until “the charm’s
wound up,” setting in motion events that will gather momentum, a
recurrent image throughout the play.</p>
<p>Lines 39–91: Macbeth’s comment that the day has been “So foul and
fair” echoes the words of the three weyard sisters in Act 1 Scene 1.
Banquo’s response to the sight of the sisters reinforces their nonhuman
qualities: they “look not like th’inhabitants o’th’earth.” He says that
they “should be women” but their beards suggest otherwise: gender is
called into question. Macbeth wants them to speak, which they do,
hailing him as “Thane of Glamis,” the title he already holds, but then
as “Thane of Cawdor” and “king hereafter.” Banquo questions Macbeth’s
response: why does he “start and seem to fear / Things that do sound so
fair”? Banquo then asks what the future holds for him. The three weyard
sisters tell him that his children shall be kings, and though he will be
“lesser” than Macbeth, he will be “greater.” Macbeth asks how he is to
become the Thane of Cawdor, or king, as this “Stands not within the
prospect of belief,” but the sisters vanish without further speech.
Their ethereal quality is emphasized by Macbeth and Banquo’s description
of them in terms of “bubbles,” “air,” and “breath.” Banquo questions
their existence, but Macbeth focuses on the prophecies.</p>
<p>Lines 92–171: Ross announces that Macbeth is now Thane of Cawdor.
Macbeth asks, “Why do you dress me in borrowed robes?” highlighting
recurrent images of apparel and of concealment and disguise. Angus
explains that Cawdor has been executed for treason. From this point in
the scene, Macbeth is divided from the other characters by his
increasing number of asides, indicating the separation and tension
between the private and public aspects of himself. He asks Banquo if he
hopes that his children will become kings, now that part of the prophecy
has come true, but Banquo is uncertain, warning that “instruments of
darkness tell us truths” only to “betray” us. Macbeth then talks aside
about the prophecies, moving toward “the swelling act” of his becoming
king. We see that he is already thinking of taking destiny into his own
hands as his mind presents him with a “horrid image,” and he concludes,
“Come what come may,” one of his many references to time, destiny, and
inevitability.</p>
<p>ACT 1 SCENE 4</p>
<p>Malcolm, King Duncan’s elder son, reports Cawdor’s execution. Duncan
praises Macbeth before announcing that he is settling the succession to
the throne onto Malcolm, giving him the title Prince of Cumberland.
Macbeth takes his leave to tell Lady Macbeth of Duncan’s intended visit
and talks in an aside of his “black and deep desires.” The contrasts
between his asides and his speeches to Duncan emphasize the growing
tensions between his ambition and his loyalty.</p>
<p>ACT 1 SCENE 5</p>
<p>Lady Macbeth reads Macbeth’s letter reporting the three weyard
sisters’ prophesies, but fears that he is “too full o’th’milk of human
kindness” to “catch the nearest way” of becoming king (i.e. murdering
Duncan) and says that without “the valour of [her] tongue,” he will not
act. Lady Macbeth’s spell-like soliloquy invokes spirits to “unsex” her
and fill her with “direst cruelty.” She rejects her femininity, and with
it the associated stereotypes of weakness and compassion. When Macbeth
arrives she shows her apparent dominance over him as she urges him to be
less open in his emotions and to disguise his true self: “look like
th’innocent flower, / But be the serpent under’t.” She will take care of
everything else.</p>
<p>ACT 1 SCENE 6</p>
<p>Lady Macbeth greets Duncan and his court.</p>
<p>ACT 1 SCENE 7</p>
<p>Macbeth’s soliloquy reveals his indecision, focusing on the moral
consequences of killing Duncan, who is there “in double trust” as his
kinsman and his king, but also as his guest. Describing Duncan’s
goodness, Macbeth acknowledges that there is no impetus to commit murder
except his own “Vaulting ambition.” When Lady Macbeth interrupts,
Macbeth tells her that they cannot go through with the plan. She again
shows her dominance and ability to manipulate him by questioning his
masculinity: “When you durst do it, then you were a man.” Despite this
requirement that Macbeth live up to traditional gender roles, she once
again rejects them on her own behalf, arguing that having sworn to do
something, even pluck a suckling child from her breast and dash its
brains out, then she would do it. Her plan is that she will make
Duncan’s guards drunk, and then, when Duncan is asleep, they will kill
him. Macbeth, fired by her daring, says that she should only “Bring
forth men-children.” He declares himself “settled” on the course of
action, concluding that he must hide his “false heart” with a “false
face.”</p>
<p>ACT 2 SCENE 1</p>
<p>Lines 1–37: As Banquo and his son Fleance discuss the absolute
blackness of the night, an image that evokes both evil and secrecy,
Macbeth enters. Banquo is surprised that he is “not yet at rest” and
tells him that he has dreamed of the three weyard sisters. Macbeth lies,
saying “I think not of them,” but suggests that he would like to talk to
Banquo at some point, ambiguously suggesting that if Banquo remains
loyal to Macbeth then it will be beneficial for him. Banquo and Fleance
retire.</p>
<p>Lines 38–71: Macbeth sends a servant to tell Lady Macbeth to ring the
bell when his drink is ready, a signal that is perhaps also awaited by
the audience, thus heightening the tension of his following soliloquy.
Once alone, Macbeth sees a dagger floating before him but questions
whether it is real or “a false creation” of his “heat-oppressèd brain,”
as it seems to draw him toward Duncan’s room. His speech evokes both the
nighttime and an atmosphere of witchcraft and evil, until the bell tolls
and he declares, “I go, and it is done,” emphasizing irreversible
decision in contrast with his questioning tone at the beginning of the
speech.</p>
<p>ACT 2 SCENE 2</p>
<p>Lady Macbeth has “drugged” the “possets” (bedtime drinks) of Duncan’s
grooms so strongly that they are on the brink of death. She is herself
feeling “bold” and filled with “fire.” When she hears Macbeth, however,
her confidence and speech falter as she wonders if the grooms have woken
again. She reveals that she could not kill Duncan herself as he
“resembled / [Her] father as he slept.” Macbeth enters and announces
that he has “done the deed.” He is distressed and fixates on his
inability to repeat “Amen” after Malcolm and Donalbain (or possibly the
grooms?) when he overheard them saying their prayers. He also heard a
voice cry that “Macbeth does murder sleep.” His apparent weakness
appears to renew Lady Macbeth’s strength, creating another shift in the
power dynamic of their relationship. She notices that he has mistakenly
brought the grooms’ daggers away with him and orders him to take them
back. He refuses, and accusing him of being “infirm of purpose,” she
takes them, intending to smear the grooms in Duncan’s blood, so that
they will appear guilty. In her absence, Macbeth is disturbed by
knocking, and worries that he will never remove the blood from his
hands. His wife returns, saying that her hands are the same bloody color
as his (a visual symbol of their shared guilt) but that “a little water”
will remove the blood and “clear us of this deed.” She leads him away to
wash and put on his nightgown.</p>
<p>ACT 2 SCENE 3</p>
<p>Lines 1–38: In the play’s only episode with a “comic” element, the
Porter goes to the door, imagining himself as the gatekeeper of hell,
providing ironically grim humor after the events of the previous scene.
The repeated knocking emphasizes Macbeth’s notion that peace and sleep
have been permanently destroyed.</p>
<p>Lines 39–85: Macduff and Lennox ask for Macbeth, who greets them and
says that Duncan is not yet awake. He takes them to the king’s door and
waits with Lennox as Macduff goes in. Lennox describes the “unruly”
night that has passed, suggesting that the storm was an omen. Macduff
returns in horror, having discovered Duncan’s body. He sends the other
two in as he shouts to wake the household and calls for the alarm bell
to be rung.</p>
<p>Lines 86–164: The confusion that characterizes the rest of this
scene, as individuals move on and off stage, shouting or conducting
brief, fragmentary dialogue, emphasizes the disorder created by Duncan’s
murder. Lady Macbeth demands to know why they have been woken, but,
ironically, Macduff says that it is not for the ears of a “gentle lady”
and announces the murder to Banquo as Macbeth and Lennox re-enter.
Macbeth, in his “public” role, gives a formal speech about how “The wine
of life is drawn,” as Malcolm and Donalbain arrive and hear of their
father’s death. Lennox explains that it seems Duncan’s grooms killed
him, as he found them and their daggers covered in blood. Macbeth claims
that he killed the grooms in his fury, but as Macduff questions him,
Lady Macbeth seems to faint, drawing attention away from her husband. As
Macduff and Banquo call for help and Macbeth suggests that they all arm
themselves, Malcolm and Donalbain discuss matters. Fearing they may be
the next victims, they leave for England and Ireland.</p>
<p>ACT 2 SCENE 4</p>
<p>Ross discusses the strange omens that have surrounded events, such as
the darkness that “entombs” the earth even though it is daytime,
reflecting Macbeth’s reversal of natural order. Macduff arrives to
report that Duncan’s grooms were responsible for the murder and it is
believed that they were hired by Malcolm and Donalbain, who have fled.
Ross comments that “sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth,” and Macduff
says that he has already gone to Scone to be crowned. Ross intends to go
to the coronation, but Macduff goes home to Fife.</p>
<p>ACT 3 SCENE 1</p>
<p>Lines 1–46: Banquo contemplates how the three weyard sisters’
prophesies have come true for Macbeth, who is now king, but fears that
Macbeth has “played” “most foully” in order that they should. He also
considers the sisters’ predictions for himself, that he will be “the
root and father / Of many kings,” and wonders if this is true. He stops
as he hears the approach of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, who flatter him as
their “chief guest” at a feast that evening. Macbeth asks if Banquo
intends to ride with Fleance that afternoon, asking how far he intends
to go and urging him not to be back late. He then declares that “every
man” will be “master of his time / Till seven,” raising the matter of
time once again and drawing attention to Macbeth’s own attempts to
“master” the world around him.</p>
<p>Lines 47–151: When the others have left, Macbeth sends for some men
who await him outside the palace. He reflects on Banquo’s “royalty of
nature,” which makes him the one person to fear. He remembers the weyard
sisters’ prophecy that Banquo will be the father of kings but that he
himself wears a “fruitless crown,” and therefore he has murdered Duncan
and given up his immortal soul on behalf of “Banquo’s issue.” He is
interrupted by the servant bringing in the men: they are hired
Murderers. Macbeth reminds them of a previous conversation in which he
persuaded them that Banquo had wronged them. He asks if they are ready
to kill him. They are, and Macbeth instructs them to kill Fleance as
well, that night and away from the palace. The distancing of the deed
from the palace, and the placing of the Murderers outside the palace
gates at the beginning of this scene suggests Macbeth’s continuing
attempts to separate his darker personal element from his public
face.</p>
<p>ACT 3 SCENE 2</p>
<p>Sending a servant to fetch her husband, Lady Macbeth echoes his words
in the previous scene as she contemplates the uncertainty of their
achievements when “desire is got without content.” When Macbeth arrives,
she asks him why he keeps dwelling on the past: “what’s done is done.”
He tells her that they are not yet safe and that he would be better dead
and in peace, like Duncan, than living with a tortured mind that is
“full of scorpions.” She encourages him to be “bright and jovial” with
their guests. He replies that she must do the same, particularly with
Banquo. He tells her that he has planned “A deed of dreadful note,” but
refuses to say what it is. His comment “Be innocent of the knowledge,
dearest chuck” is strangely tender in contrast to his following
invocation to the “seeling night,” but also suggests a new division
between the two characters as Macbeth begins to work independently of
his wife’s influence.</p>
<p>ACT 3 SCENE 3</p>
<p>The two Murderers meet up with a third and wait for Banquo and
Fleance. The First Murderer strikes out the torch and Banquo is attacked
and killed in darkness, but Fleance escapes.</p>
<p>ACT 3 SCENE 4</p>
<p>Lines 1–34: Macbeth addresses his guests with appropriately formal
language, emphasizing the ceremonial nature of the banquet. The arrival
of the Murderers, however, reinforces the breakdown of order, as this
private element of Macbeth’s life intrudes upon his public space. There
is a marked change in his language as he speaks to them, showing cruel
indifference to Banquo’s death. When he learns of Fleance’s escape, he
realizes that he is still not safe.</p>
<p>Lines 35–141: Lady Macbeth reminds her husband of his duties as a
host and he returns to take his place at the banquet, observing that
Banquo should be there. As he does so, Banquo’s ghost sits in Macbeth’s
place. Macbeth’s irrational response causes Ross to suggest that Macbeth
is not well, but Lady Macbeth assures everyone that her husband has
always had these momentary “fits” and that if they pay too much
attention, they “shall offend him.” She then turns to Macbeth and, once
again questioning his masculinity, asks him, “Are you a man?” She says
that he looks “but on a stool.” Macbeth is insistent, telling her to
look upon the ghost—which no one else can see. The ghost disappears, and
again, Lady Macbeth reminds her husband of his guests. He apologizes for
his outburst, blaming “a strange infirmity” and calling them all to
drink to Banquo, “whom we miss.” On cue, the ghost re-enters and Macbeth
breaks down again, crying “Hence, horrible shadow!” Lady Macbeth stops
Ross from questioning her husband, claiming that to do so will “enrage”
him. She tells the guests to leave and “Stand not upon the order of your
going,” emphasizing the breakdown of social order now that Macbeth is
king.</p>
<p>Lines 142–165: Macbeth observes that Macduff is not present at court.
He resolves to visit the three weyard sisters again. Lady Macbeth
encourages him to sleep. The gathering momentum of events is evident as
Macbeth says that as he has come so far he can only go forward, and that
they “are yet but young in deed.”</p>
<p>ACT 3 SCENE 5</p>
<p>The three weyard sisters meet Hecate, goddess of witchcraft, who is
angry about her exclusion from Macbeth’s affairs. Before she is called
away by spirits, she says that she will be there when Macbeth next
consults them, when they will “draw him on to his confusion.”</p>
<p>ACT 3 SCENE 6</p>
<p>Lennox meets with another Lord and reports that Fleance is suspected
of Banquo’s murder, but reveals his suspicions that Macbeth, “the
tyrant,” is responsible for this and for Duncan’s death. The Lord
informs Lennox that Macduff has joined Malcolm “in the English court” to
ask the English king to make war with Macbeth. Lennox prays for
assistance for their “suffering country.”</p>
<p>ACT 4 SCENE 1</p>
<p>Lines 1–46: The three weyard sisters are joined by Hecate and three
others in singing and dancing, culminating in the announcement that
“Something wicked this way comes” as Macbeth enters.</p>
<p>Lines 47–143: Macbeth’s sense of his own power is emphasized as he
commands the three weyard sisters to give him answers, even if it causes
terrible consequences for the world. They agree, but ask if he wants the
answers from them or their “masters.” Macbeth says to “Call em,” and the
three weyard sisters summon three Apparitions before him. The first, an
armed (armored) head, tells him to “beware Macduff.” The second, a
bloody child, tells him that “none of woman born / Shall harm Macbeth,”
prompting Macbeth to declare that in this case he need not fear Macduff,
but that he will kill him anyway. The Third Apparition, a crowned child
holding a tree, declares that Macbeth will be undefeated until Birnam
Wood comes against him at Dunsinane Hill. Reassured, Macbeth declares
“That will never be” and that he will “live the lease of nature,”
returning once more to his preoccupation with time. He then asks the
sisters if Banquo’s “issue” will ever reign, but they refuse to tell
him. Confident in his power, Macbeth declares “I will be satisfied” and
commands them to answer. In response, the sisters conjure an image of a
line of eight kings, all descendants of a “blood-boltered” Banquo, who
smiles at Macbeth. Macbeth is left astounded as the three weyard sisters
vanish.</p>
<p>Lines 144–169: Macbeth calls Lennox and demands to know if he saw the
sisters. Lennox says that he did not and tells Macbeth that messengers
have arrived with news of Macduff’s flight to England. Macbeth’s final
aside reveals a sharp contrast to his indecision in Act 1 Scene 7, as he
talks of how he will “crown” his “thoughts with acts,” “surprise”
Macduff’s castle, and kill his wife and children.</p>
<p>ACT 4 SCENE 2</p>
<p>Lady Macduff questions Ross about her husband’s flight to England,
claiming that it was “madness” and that he cannot love her or “his
babes” if he has left them in danger. Ross defends Macduff, but cannot
stay. Lady Macduff tells her son that his father is dead and cynically
responds to his claims that he is not by calling Macduff “a traitor”
because he “swears and lies.” As they argue, a Messenger brings news of
impending danger and urges her to run with her “little ones.” Lady
Macduff asserts that she has “done no harm,” but acknowledges that this
is a “womanly defence.” The Murderers enter and demand to know Macduff’s
whereabouts, accusing him of treachery. His son denies this and is
killed. Lady Macduff flees, pursued by the Murderers.</p>
<p>ACT 4 SCENE 3</p>
<p>Lines 1–154: In England, Malcolm does not trust Macduff, suspecting
that he may have been sent by the tyrant Macbeth, particularly since he
has left his family behind. Macduff denies this, but Malcolm tests him
by claiming that he is unfit to be king, describing his own vices. At
first, Macduff politely denies this, but then breaks down and despairs
for his country’s future, saying that Malcolm is unfit to live or rule.
Malcolm reveals that it was a test and that he now believes in Macduff’s
“good truth and honour,” reassuring him that he has none of the vices he
claimed earlier.</p>
<p>Lines 155–275: A doctor says that “a crew of wretched souls” is
waiting for the English king to cure them and Malcolm explains to
Macduff that the king can cure scrofula. His description of this, using
terms such as “holy,” “healing,” “virtue,” and “grace,” contrasts with
the evil and destruction associated with Macbeth’s tyrannical kingship.
Ross arrives and reports Scotland’s suffering. Macduff asks for news of
his family and Ross lies that they are “well.” He urges Malcolm to
return to Scotland and Malcolm says that he intends to do so, with
support from “Gracious England.” Ross breaks down and reveals the truth
about Macduff’s family. Macduff is distraught. When Malcolm urges him to
“Dispute it like a man,” Macduff says that he will do so, but that he
must also “feel it as a man,” presenting a more emotional perception of
masculinity than that held by the Macbeths.</p>
<p>ACT 5 SCENE 1</p>
<p>A Doctor and a Gentlewoman wait for evidence of Lady Macbeth’s recent
sleepwalking. The Gentlewoman describes how Lady Macbeth rises while
still asleep, writes, and then conceals what she has written, but she
refuses to repeat what is said during these episodes. Lady Macbeth
enters, rubbing her hands as though she is washing them. Her speeches
reveal her guilty conscience about the deaths of Duncan, Lady Macduff,
and Banquo as she complains that “the smell of blood” is still on her
hands. The repetitive and disjointed nature of her speech reflects her
state of mind and contrasts sharply with her previous cool efficiency.
The watchers realize the significance of the spectacle but the Doctor
says that she is more in need of “divine” help than that of a
physician.</p>
<p>ACT 5 SCENE 2</p>
<p>In the first of six short scenes that run into each other—the pace of
events is now at its quickest—Lennox and other Scottish noblemen discuss
their intention to join with Malcom and Macduff near Birnam Wood. They
reveal that “the tyrant” Macbeth is fortifying Dunsinane against the
English.</p>
<p>ACT 5 SCENE 3</p>
<p>Macbeth issues orders, confident that the prophecies mean he is
invincible. A frightened servant reports that there are “ten thousand”
English soldiers and Macbeth sends him away, angry at his cowardice. He
calls for Seyton. His speech as he waits reveals a weariness with life:
he feels he has “lived long enough” and his actions mean that his life
will hold not honor and friendship but “Curses.” He instructs Seyton to
bring his armor. When he inquires after his wife, the doctor reports
that Lady Macbeth is “troubled” and Macbeth tells him to cure her
“diseased” mind, but is told that it is a patient alone who can deal
with their own conscience.</p>
<p>ACT 5 SCENE 4</p>
<p>The English forces arrive at Birnam Wood and camouflage themselves
with tree branches to disguise their numbers.</p>
<p>ACT 5 SCENE 5</p>
<p>As Macbeth defiantly issues orders to Seyton, a cry is heard and
Seyton is sent to investigate. Macbeth contemplates how he would once
have been disturbed by such a noise, but now that he has “supped full
with horrors” he is no longer affected. Seyton returns with news of Lady
Macbeth’s death, and Macbeth’s response is weary and resigned as he
describes life as “a walking shadow,” a “tale” “Signifying nothing.” A
messenger brings news that he has seen Birnam Wood moving. Angry, then
resigned, Macbeth vows to fight on.</p>
<p>ACT 5 SCENE 6</p>
<p>Malcolm commands the English forces to throw off their camouflage and
places the English soldier Siward and his son at the head of the
army.</p>
<p>ACT 5 SCENE 7</p>
<p>Macbeth fights, unafraid because he can only be killed by one “not
born of woman.” He kills young Siward and exits. Macduff passes across
the stage, searching for Macbeth, and then Siward leads Malcolm to the
defeated castle. Macbeth re-enters, scorning escape in suicide. Macduff
finds him and they fight, but Macbeth claims that he bears “a charmed
life” because of the prophecy. Macduff replies that he was “from his
mother’s womb / Untimely ripped.” Roused by Macduff’s threats that he
will be kept captive like “rarer monsters,” Macbeth refuses to yield and
they exit fighting, then re-enter after “Alarums,” and Macbeth is slain.
Macduff drags him away. As Malcolm and Siward discuss the battle, Ross
informs Siward of his son’s death. Macduff enters, bearing Macbeth’s
severed head, and hails Malcolm as “King of Scotland.” Malcolm makes his
noblemen into earls and expresses his intention to deal with matters “in
measure, time and place,” emphasizing a return to order.</p>
<p>MACBETH IN</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>THE RSC AND BEYOND</p>
<p>The best way to understand a Shakespeare play is to see it or ideally
to participate in it. By examining a range of productions, we may gain a
sense of the extraordinary variety of approaches and interpretations
that are possible—a variety that gives Shakespeare his unique capacity
to be reinvented and made “our contemporary” four centuries after his
death.</p>
<p>We begin with a brief overview of the play’s theatrical and cinematic
life, offering historical perspectives on how it has been performed. We
then analyze in more detail a series of productions staged over the last
half-century by the Royal Shakespeare Company. The sense of dialogue
between productions that can only occur when a company is dedicated to
the revival and investigation of the Shakespeare canon over a long
period, together with the uniquely comprehensive archival resource of
promptbooks, program notes, reviews, and interviews, held on behalf of
the RSC at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon,
allows an “RSC stage history” to become a crucible in which the
chemistry of the play can be explored.</p>
<p>Finally, we go to the horse’s mouth. Modern theater is dominated by
the figure of the director, who must hold together the whole play,
whereas the actor must concentrate on his or her part. The director’s
viewpoint is therefore especially valuable. Shakespeare’s plasticity is
wonderfully revealed when we hear directors of highly successful
productions answering the same questions in very different ways.</p>
<p>FOUR CENTURIES OF MACBETH: AN OVERVIEW</p>
<p>Macbeth is one of the most frequently performed of all Shakespeare’s
plays. Its central place in the repertory has resulted in a full stage
history. Simon Forman, the Elizabethan quack doctor and astrologer,
described a production he saw at the Globe in 1611. Scholars, however,
believe that the play with its oblique references to the Gunpowder Plot
of 1605 was first written and performed around 1606 as a tribute to King
James I, who was also James VI of Scotland. It is impossible to say
whether or not Forman gives an accurate account of the production he saw
(it has also been suggested that the document is a fabrication, but the
balance of evidence very strongly supports its authenticity). His
perception may have been filtered through a reading of Holinshed’s
Chronicles, the play’s main source. And the version Forman witnessed may
have been different from that which survives (see the discussion in the
introduction of Middleton’s possible revisions). It is striking that he
makes no reference to Macbeth’s second visit to the weyard sisters.
Nevertheless, Forman’s report is of inestimable value as the only
detailed eyewitness report of the performance of a Shakespearean tragedy
in Shakespeare’s lifetime:</p>
<p>There was to be observed first, how Macbeth and Banquo, two noblemen
of Scotland, riding through a wood, there stood before them three women,
fairies or nymphs, and saluted Macbeth, saying three times unto him,
‘Hail, Macbeth, King of Codon, for thou shalt be a king, but shall beget
no kings,’ etc. Then said Banquo, ‘What, all to Macbeth, and nothing to
me?’ ‘Yes,’ said the nymphs, ‘hail to thee, Banquo, thou shalt beget
kings, yet be no king.’ And so they departed and came to the court of
Scotland, to Duncan, King of Scots, and it was in the days of Edward the
Confessor. And Duncan bad them both kindly welcome, and made Macbeth
forthwith Prince of Northumberland, and sent him home to his own castle,
and appointed Macbeth to provide for him, for he would sup with him the
next day at night, and did so. And Macbeth contrived to kill Duncan, and
through the persuasion of his wife did that night murder the king in his
own castle, being his guest, and there were many prodigies seen that
night and the day before. And when Macbeth had murdered the king, the
blood on his hands could not be washed off by any means, nor from his
wife’s hands, which handled the bloody daggers in hiding them, by which
means they became both much amazed and affronted. The murder being
known, Duncan’s two sons fled, the one to England, the [other to] Wales,
to save themselves. They being fled, they were supposed guilty of the
murder of their father, which was nothing so. Then was Macbeth crowned
king, and then he, for fear of Banquo his old companion, that he should
beget kings but be no king himself, he contrived the death of Banquo and
caused him to be murdered on the way as he rode. The next night, being
at supper with his noblemen whom he had to bid to a feast, to the which
also Banquo should have come, he began to speak of noble Banquo and to
wish that he were there. And as he thus did, standing up to drink a
carouse to him, the ghost of Banquo came and sat down in his chair
behind him. and he, turning about to sit down again, saw the ghost of
Banquo, which [af]fronted him so, that he fell into a great passion of
fear and fury, uttering many words about his murder, by which, when they
heard that Banquo was murdered, they suspected Macbeth. Then Macdove
fled to England to the king’s son, and so they raised an army and came
into Scotland, and at Dunston Anys overthrew Macbeth. In the meantime,
while Macdove was in England, Macbeth slew Macdove’s wife and children,
and after, in the battle, Macdove slew Macbeth. Observe also how
Macbeth’s queen did rise in the night in her sleep and walk, and talked
and confessed all, and the doctor noted her words.</p>
<p>Whatever the relationship of Forman’s report to the play as it was
first performed, there is evidence of the text being cut and adapted
from the earliest times. Two early theater promptbooks survive, one
based on a copy of the 1623 Folio belonging to the University of Padua,
and the other, known as the “Smock Alley” promptbook, on the play as it
was performed in Dublin after the 1660s.</p>
<p>Despite being one of the most frequently performed of all
Shakespeare’s plays, few modern productions include Hecate or the music
and songs, although Restoration and many later adaptations featured
spectacular visual effects. Samuel Pepys records his view of the play in
his diary in 1667 as “one of the best plays for a stage, and variety of
dancing and music, that ever I saw.” Though alien to modern
sensibilities, the idea that Macbeth was above all notable for its
singing and dancing was commonplace in the late seventeenth- and
eighteenth-century theater.</p>
<p>Although we know little of the play’s original performance, it is
assumed that Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian with the King’s Men,
played the title role. The main part has been played by the dramatic
giants of succeeding ages from Thomas Betterton to David Garrick, John
Philip Kemble to Edmund Kean, William Charles Macready to Henry Irving,
John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier to Anthony Hopkins, Ian McKellen, and
Antony Sher. Approaches to the role vary: Macbeth can be anything from
an essentially noble character overcome by ambition to an inherently
evil tyrant. The success or failure of productions is generally
dependent upon the sheer energy and charisma of the actor taking the
central role—it has always been a star vehicle for leading actors. As
for Lady Macbeth, though the part would originally have been played by a
young male apprentice, it has—together with Cleopatra—become one of the
western theater repertoire’s leading roles for mature actresses.</p>
<p>Sir William Davenant’s adaptation staged at Lincoln’s Inn Fields in
1663–64 sought to refine the play to suit the tastes of Restoration
audiences by expanding the role of Lady Macduff and making the Macduffs
a moral counterbalance to the Macbeths. Davenant eliminated the Porter
and added music, singing, and dancing for the three witches, and gave
Macbeth a final moral: “Farewell vain World, and what’s more vain in it,
Ambition.” The performance of Thomas Betterton and his wife, Mary
Saunderson, as the Macbeths was widely admired and the adaptation
remained popular for eighty years until David Garrick announced his
intention to present Macbeth “as written by Shakespeare” at Drury Lane
on 7 January 1744.</p>
<p>Garrick was a new type of actor for a new age. He tried to clear away
much of the Restoration baggage—no more flying witches—and to restore
the majority of Shakespeare’s text, although there was still no Porter,
Malcolm was less complex and self-accusatory, and the actor included a
dying speech for himself. The key to Garrick’s performance was his
attempt to create a complex, imaginative unity from the powerful and
contradictory elements of the character:</p>
<p>Through all the soliloquies of anxious reflections in the first act;
amidst the pangs of guilty apprehension, and pungent remorse, in the
second; through all the distracted terror of the third; all the
impetuous curiosity of the fourth, and all the desperation of the fifth,
Mr Garrick shews uniform, unabating excellence; scarce a look, motion,
or tone, but takes possession of our faculties, and leads them to a just
sensibility.1</p>
<p>Garrick’s Lady Macbeth was Hannah Pritchard, who “in that horrible
part had all the merit so well-drawn a character could confer.”2</p>
<p>Up to that time, Shakespeare was played in contemporary dress—famous
paintings of Garrick and Pritchard by Henry Fuseli and Johann Zoffany
show the actors dressed in eighteenth-century costume. Charles Macklin
was the first producer to attempt historical accuracy, in his 1773
staging of the play. While scenery and costumes were approved, the
elderly Macklin’s performance was not well received and the rivalry
between Macklin’s and Garrick’s supporters led to riots and the
production’s closure.</p>
<p>The most famous historical Lady Macbeth was Sarah Siddons playing
opposite her brother, John Philip Kemble, at Drury Lane in the last
years of the eighteenth century and the first decades of the nineteenth.
While the character of Lady Macbeth has been notoriously demonized, from
Malcolm’s description of her as “fiend-like” onward, successive
generations of actors have tried to humanize her. Sarah Siddons writes
of an altogether more sympathetic character in her Memoranda entitled
“Remarks on the Character of Lady Macbeth”:</p>
<p>In this astonishing creature one sees a woman in whose bosom the
passion of ambition has almost obliterated all the characteristics of
human nature; in whose composition are associated all the subjugating
powers of intellect and all the charms and graces of personal beauty.
You will probably not agree with me as to the character of that beauty …
according to my notion, it is of that character which I believe is
generally allowed to be most captivating to the other sex,—fair,
feminine, nay, perhaps, even fragile.3</p>
<p>Despite the tenor of Siddons’s remarks, there seems to be general
agreement that this account, written many years later, is hardly an
accurate picture of her own performance. As her biographer Roger Manvell
suggests, “she always played Lady Macbeth against her own inner
conception of how it should be done.”4 Manvell goes on to point out,
“from the first the impression she created in the audience was far from
this—she inspired sheer awe and terror.”5</p>
<p>Although Kemble treated Shakespeare’s three witches seriously, he
nevertheless deployed a chorus of fifty or more singing, dancing, comic
witches. The witches were traditionally played by men, usually the
company comedians, the argument being that the tragedians were all busy
elsewhere. J. P. Kemble’s niece Fanny Kemble complained in her journal
that “It has always been customary,—heaven only knows why,—to make low
comedians act the witches, and to dress them like old fishwomen … with
as due a proportion of petticoats as any woman, letting alone witch,
might desire, jocose red faces, peaked hats, and broomsticks.”6</p>
<p>Kemble’s Macbeth has been described as essentially “a noble character
who degenerates into evil.”7 The leading actor of the next generation
was Edmund Kean, a much less orthodox character who presented Macbeth as
“a determined, ruthless man who disintegrates through guilt and fear.”8
The critic William Hazlitt, generally an admirer of Kean, thought his
Macbeth “deficient in the poetry of the character.”9</p>
<p>William Charles Macready played the part for many years with a
variety of different leading ladies including Mary Amelia Huddart, Helen
Faucit, the American Charlotte Cushman, and Fanny Kemble. His
productions strove for historical accuracy in their staging. His
performance was contrasted unfavorably, however, with Samuel Phelps’s at
Sadler’s Wells, which drew general praise:</p>
<p>Since Edmund Kean’s, we have seen nothing better for vigour and vivid
effect. It is essentially distinct from and stands in contrast to Mr
Macready’s, which, however fine and classical in its conception, is but
too obviously open to the Scotch sneer of presenting ‘a very respectable
gentleman in considerable difficulties;’ so studied is it in all its
parts, and subdued into commonplace by too much artifice; fretfulness,
moreover, substituting high passion in the fifth act. The
straightforward and right-earnest energy of Mr Phelps’s acting, on the
contrary, made all present contemplate the business as one of
seriousness and reality; while the occasional pathos of his declamation
thrilled the heart within many a rude bosom with unwonted emotion.10</p>
<p>The London Times’s reviewer was impressed by the originality of the
staging and praised the production as a whole: “There is a spirit of
freshness diffused over it.”11 Phelps’s most distinguished Lady Macbeth
was Isabella Glyn, described by one reviewer as “the very heroine of
crime—the guardian demon of the crowned assassin—the weird-like
accessory and human agent of the mysterious spirits that wait on
Nature’s mischief.”12</p>
<p>Charles Kean specialized in spectacular, supposedly historically
accurate productions. His Macbeth, which opened at Covent Garden in
1840, enjoyed popular success, but while Ellen Kean’s Lady Macbeth was
favorably reviewed, his Macbeth failed:</p>
<p>In Charles Kean’s Macbeth all the tragedy has vanished; sympathy is
impossible, because the mind of the criminal is hidden from us. He makes
Macbeth ignoble—one whose crime is that of a common murderer, with
perhaps a tendency towards Methodism. It is not, however, so much the
acting as the ‘getting up’ of Macbeth which will attract the
public.13</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century actors generally humanized Lady Macbeth, making
her feminine and womanly, a good wife, if somewhat misguided. Adelaide
Ristori, though, domineered over Tesibaldo Vitaliani’s Macbeth in an
Italian production at the Lyceum in 1857, which successfully toured
Europe and the United States. Edwin Booth played the role successfully
in New York in numerous productions with Charlotte Cushman, and also
with the Polish-born Helena Modjeska, who, like Helen Faucit, emphasized
Lady Macbeth’s femininity.</p>
<p>Henry Irving’s productions at the Lyceum were spectacular and
enormously successful. His dark costumes and subdued lighting for
Macbeth “blended together to compose a dark, massive, dangerous
world.”14 However, his reading of Macbeth as “a bloody-minded
hypocritical villain”15 failed to convince all the critics:</p>
<p>A Macbeth less luxurious than is now seen cannot be readily
conceived. Yet the word is apt, and furnishes a clear indication of the
character. Against the over-intellectuality of Macbeth the imaginative
power and the marvellous mobility of feature of the actor cannot
prevail. The ingenuity, subtlety, picturesqueness, and power of the
performance may be granted, but the new Macbeth will not replace the
old.16</p>
<p>It is clear from the notes that Ellen Terry, Irving’s Lady Macbeth,
scribbled in the margins of her working script that she shared the
prevailing notions about the nature of women. Lady Macbeth’s tragedy, as
Ellen Terry saw it, lay in an essentially feminine ambition, a misplaced
and afterward disillusioned faith in a husband devoid of the stuff of
kings: “A woman (all over a woman) who believed in Macbeth with a
lurking knowledge of his weakness, but who never found him out to be
nothing but a brave soldier and a weakling, until that damned party in
the parlor—‘The Banquet Scene’ as it is called.”17 Ellen Terry judged it
right to keep Mrs. Siddons’s cold determination while discarding the
fiendish aspects of her nature that would have so disturbed Victorian
beliefs about the nature of women. Many critics could not accept this
“enchanting being” as Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth:</p>
<p>So exquisite a creature is she as by the flickering firelight she
reads her husband’s letter, so radiant in robes of indescribable beauty,
and with such rhapsody of passionate longing does she lean back to wait
for the coming of her lord, we decline to accept her as other than a
being out of Arthurian legend.18</p>
<p>Despite performing his role in Italian in an otherwise English
production, the actor Tommaso Salvini’s red-bearded Macbeth combined,
according to Robert Louis Stevenson, “pride and the sense of animal
well-being” with “moral smallness.” His appearance in the final act
suggested how “the atmosphere of blood, which pervades the whole
tragedy, has entered into the man and subdued him to its own nature; and
an indescribable degradation, a slackness and puffiness, has overtaken
his features. He has breathed the air of carnage and supped full of
horrors.”19 Sarah Bernhardt, meanwhile, played Lady Macbeth in a French
prose translation turning the play into “a dull and somewhat vulgar
melodrama”20 in which Bernhardt’s histrionic performance was described
in the London Times as “inadequate and unsatisfactory.”21</p>
<p>The scholarly Johnston Forbes-Robertson, an acclaimed Hamlet, and
sophisticated Mrs. Patrick Campbell were miscast as the Macbeths in the
Lyceum’s 1898 production. Herbert Beerbohm Tree’s spectacular production
with Violet Vanbrugh as Lady Macbeth was more successful but included
fifteen scene changes and lasted over four hours. Blackwood’s Edinburgh
Magazine complained that Beerbohm Tree “has sought to achieve a
pictorial, not a dramatic effect.”22 Meanwhile, the reaction against
such overblown productions, which started in Germany, was taken up by
William Poel, who founded the Elizabethan Stage Society and staged his
plays as far as possible as they had been in Shakespeare’s time—on
simple thrust stages with minimal scenery and props.</p>
<p>These contrasting production styles continued to compete until Barry
Jackson’s 1928 Birmingham Repertory Theatre production, directed by H.
J. Ayliff, set the play in the period of the First World War:</p>
<p>The battle scenes with which it opened and closed were brought up to
date with exploding shells and rattling machine guns. Macbeth was
dressed in khaki uniform with riding-breeches, high, polished boots, and
a chest covered in medal ribbons. Lady Macbeth appeared in a short,
sleeveless cocktail dress, and Lady Macduff and her son were murdered
over a cup of afternoon tea by killers who entered through a casement
window.23</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">

(Lyceum Theatre, London, 1888).</li>
</ol>
<p>Critics complained that the poetry of the play was lost in the
clipped modern delivery, although Laurence Olivier won praise for his
performance as Malcolm. For all its faults, the production led the way
“to a new understanding of Macbeth as a play about alienation in an
amoral modern world, whose hero, Kafka-like, finds himself isolated by
his visions from those around him, and who discovers that hell is not a
place elsewhere but the nightmare within.”24 As critic Michael Mullin
goes on to argue, “Jackson’s failed experiment pointed the way and made
possible a series of theatrical experiments leading from Komisarjevsky
to Guthrie, and finally culminating in Glen Byam Shaw’s tour de force at
Stratford-upon-Avon in which Sir Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh gave
what theater historians consider a definitive Macbeth and Lady
Macbeth.”25</p>
<p>John Gielgud was involved in three productions between 1930 and 1952.
The first at the Old Vic was directed by Harcourt Williams. Gielgud’s
romantic Macbeth was admired for its intellectual quality and the
quality of the verse-speaking. The critic James Agate judged Martita
Hunt’s Lady Macbeth, playing opposite Gielgud, to be “too likeable.”26
Gielgud went on to direct the play himself in 1942 at the Piccadilly
Theatre, in a performance that, though not to all tastes, the critic
Audrey Williamson considered</p>
<p>Poetically … the crowning achievement of our time; his ‘airborne
dagger’ seared the eyeballs, and the imaginative impulse was never
wholly lost until it dwindled to the yellow flicker of the ‘brief
candle’ and autumn sere. Yet surprisingly our most lyrical actor caught
the soldier and murderer too; this was a lithe and virile figure,
combining the mud-stained practicability of the warrior with the golden
eloquence of the poet: a haunted and haunting performance, with a twilit
bitterness at the last.27</p>
<p>Gielgud’s Stratford-upon-Avon production in 1952 with the amiable
Ralph Richardson in the title role was less successful. J. C. Trewin
thought that as Lady Macbeth, “Margaret Leighton, at first a tigress
burning bright, has the drive, the command that Macbeth lacks.”28</p>
<p>Expatriate Russian director Theodore Komisarjevsky’s 1933 production
at Stratford revolutionized the play with an expressionist design
against a background of war. Its experimental quality received mixed
reviews, but despite initial reservations, many critics recognized its
significance: “It was swift and exciting; intelligently directed to
suggest presage of impending doom; and when once we had grasped the
producer’s conventions and intentions all, or nearly all, fell into
place naturally and inevitably. The old play was given a new
cutting-edge.”29</p>
<p>Orson Welles’s 1936 production at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem was
equally cutting edge, set in Haiti with an all-black cast, including
many nonprofessional actors. It became known as the “Voodoo” Macbeth and
was noted mainly for its theatrical inventiveness and the violence of
its imagery, which tended to overshadow individual performances.</p>
<p>Michael Benthall’s successful production at the Old Vic with Paul
Rogers and Ann Todd was first staged at the Edinburgh Festival in 1954
to great critical acclaim and afterward toured America, but the
production that has come to be regarded as one of the two or three most
successful of the twentieth century—along with Trevor Nunn’s
Dench/McKellen version, discussed by the director below—was the 1955
production at Stratford with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. Glen
Byam Shaw’s direction was in fact considered rather ordinary; it was
Olivier who made the show, as the London Times’s critic records:</p>
<p>The striking thing about the performance is its psychological
penetrativeness. It cuts boldly through all sorts of superficial
contradictions in the character. The usual difficulty of reconciling the
tough warrior with the superstition-ridden neurotic seems scarcely to
exist. Attention from first to last is fastened on the mind of Macbeth.
Sir Laurence is concerned first to show that his mind is already filled
with dangerous thoughts and desires which it dare not formulate till the
Weird Sisters give them voice. By various subtleties and ingenuities,
each having the freshness of a new-minted coin, he suggests vividly that
the latent nobility of character may yet assert itself against the fatal
lure of ambition, but once this hope has gone and dreadful desires have
turned to deed the actor treats the deed as a mere incident making
possible the psychological drama which follows.30</p>
<p>Macbeth’s cultural legacy is pervasive due to the relative simplicity
of the plot and its archetypal nature, the rise and fall of an ambitious
leader, as well as its powerful characterization, especially of Lady
Macbeth. It has been frequently adapted into other media—opera, novels,
film, television, science fiction, and song—and employed for a variety
of purposes from political cartoons and satire to advertising. As Irena
Makaryk suggests in her discussion of Ukrainian director Les Kurbas’s
1924 modernistic, anti-bourgeois production, “Within the general trend
of modernizing Shakespeare in the West from the 1960s on, Macbeth has
been the ‘trademark’ avant-garde play, its primitivism and anarchism
being particularly attractive characteristics.”31</p>
<p>Verdi’s Macbeth was his first adaptation of a Shakespeare play and
its brilliance was instantly recognized. First performed at the Teatro
della Pergola, Florence, in March 1847, it was revised by Verdi in 1865
for the Paris Opéra, with an added ballet sequence. This is the version
generally performed today.</p>
<p>As well as the Ukrainian adaptation discussed by Makaryk, there have
been productions across Europe, including a Croatian-language version in
1997 directed by Henryk Baranowski. Welcome Msomi’s South African
adaptation uMabatha, based on the life of the great Zulu warrior Chaka,
was staged at the Globe Theatre in 1997. In 1995, the Australian
director Simon Woods produced an experimental bilingual English/Japanese
version at the Zen Zen Zo theater in Kyoto. The great Japanese director
Yukio Ninagawa has created two distinct productions (one in 1980, the
other in 2001, both frequently revived), with Samurai allusions fitting
to Macbeth’s military demeanor, and a design based around a cherry tree,
its falling blossoms representative of that transience and mortality to
which Macbeth alludes in his speech about the turning leaf. At the
climax, cherry blossoms were seen on the branches of Birnam Wood hewn
and borne by Malcolm’s army.</p>

</ol>
<p>There have been numerous film versions, including Orson Welles’s
idiosyncratic 1948 movie which, unlike his stage production, was set in
Scotland. Welles cut approximately half the text and gave the play a
religious focus, even inventing a new character, the “Holy Father.”
Welles himself played Macbeth. Ken Hughes’s black-and-white film Joe
Macbeth (1955) sets the play in New York’s gangland with simplified
dialogue and plot. Cinematography invokes a film noir style, playing
with light and shadow, high and low angles.</p>
<p>Roman Polanski’s 1971 film with the young Jon Finch and Francesca
Annis as the Macbeths was shot in bright technicolor, with much gore,
especially in the scene where Macduff’s family are slaughtered in their
home. It did not go unremarked that Polanski had begun work on the film
shortly after his heavily pregnant wife, the actress Sharon Tate,
together with three of her friends, was brutally murdered by followers
of Charles Manson. The film, financed by Hugh Hefner’s Playboy company,
was also controversial for Lady Macbeth’s nudity in her sleepwalking
scene and for its ending, which lacks textual warrant, wherein Donalbain
goes to the weyard sisters, as if to initiate a further cycle of
ambition and violence.</p>
<p>Akiro Kurosawa’s film adaptation Throne of Blood (1957), a
translation of the plot and setting into Samurai culture, shot in
expressionistic black and white, is generally acclaimed as a classic of
Japanese cinema. It has been highly influential on western cinema from
the Seven Samurai remake (The Magnificent Seven) onward. A number of
stage productions have been filmed, including Trevor Nunn’s acclaimed
1971 production for the RSC at The Other Place with Judi Dench and Ian
McKellen, and Gregory Doran’s at the Swan with Antony Sher and Harriet
Walter.</p>
<p>AT THE RSC</p>
<p>Stones Have Been Known to Move and Trees to Speak</p>
<p>Images of blood and darkness dominate the language of Shakespeare’s
shortest and most exciting tragedy. Fair is foul and foul is fair—from
the instant we are plunged into the Scottish play there is a sense of
stagnancy, of something rotting and eating away at all the natural and
pure things of this world. Witches, vile murder, ghosts, apparitions,
and nightmares punctuate the action of the protagonist’s story. Is it
any surprise that this play has been the inspiration for so much Gothic
and horror fiction, and that Roman Polanski’s film version is listed in
publications and websites that deal with the greatest British horror
films of the twentieth century?</p>
<p>Despite the play’s historical background and its obvious references
to the political world of the time, it is the psychological complexities
of the Macbeths, the disintegration of the mind, and the usurpation of
good by evil, which have proved the focal point for most modern
productions. In a world dominated by the lust for power, Shakespeare
gives us a case study of how simply and quickly the evil in man can
spread like a virus. How can a person commit or order acts that by their
nature deny any human feeling? As critic Stanley Wells points out: “The
play’s framework of national destiny has proved less attractive to later
ages than the personal tragedy of Macbeth played within it; many modern
productions adjust the text to throw even more emphasis on Macbeth and
his Lady.”32</p>
<p>Peter Hall’s 1967 production focused on the powerful degree to which
Macbeth is a Christian play. He was led by the religious symbolism in
such lines as:</p>
<p>Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.</p>
<p>Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope</p>
<p>The Lord’s anointed temple, and stole thence</p>
<p>The life o’th’building.</p>
<p>The murder of the king is seen as a sacrilegious act, and with it
“nature seems dead.” In Hall’s opening scene, the weyard sisters were
shown as huge silhouettes inverting a crucifix on which they poured
blood; a cross was carried behind Duncan and, later, behind Malcolm;
Duncan wore the white robes of consecrated kingship, and when later
Macbeth appeared in the same robes, “the blasphemy was shocking.” The
religious reading was carried through to the set, which “consisted of a
dark, oak interior which looked like a cathedral.”33 Before the dialogue
began, there was</p>
<p>a quite sensational statement of purity, virtue, innocence, snatched
away to show the evil lying beneath. A great white sheet—an angel’s
wing?—hung over the stage and, just before the appearance of the
witches, fluttered away, flapping into extinction. Its disappearance
revealed a blood-red carpet like a heath with clotted heather. One felt
that if one pressed one’s hand in it blood would ooze out. It was backed
by red granite-seeming cliffs and, at times during the action, sections
of it were removed to show an arid bone-white expanse—as if it rested on
a bleached skeleton. The witches seemed to emerge from beneath this
bloody carpet, bearing an inverted crucifix … Macbeth for [Hall] was the
’metaphysics of evil.’34</p>
<p>To focus on this religious aspect of the play does help to overcome
one of the main stumbling blocks for a production of Macbeth: its
representation of the supernatural, the need to make a modern secular
audience accept a world in which witches, ghosts, and apparitions are
powerful forces.</p>
<p>In 1982, by contrast, Howard Davies took religion out of the play and
deliberately set out a “policy of demystification.”35 His production</p>
<p>completely jettisoned the atmosphere of blood and darkness in which
so many Macbeths have floundered. Instead, he used a direct, clinical
style which made no attempt to conceal its theatrical devices. The stage
was dominated by two percussionists and their battery of equipment,
brilliantly spotlit on an upper level, who punctuated and commented on
the action, rather than providing atmosphere.36</p>
<p>In his depiction of the supernatural there was an “abandonment of any
attempt to impersonate the witches as bearded, skinny-lipped hags,
withered and wild in their attire”:37</p>
<p>The weird sisters were attractive young actresses who performed
routines with whirling blankets, and who deliberately fragmented their
speeches into ‘imperfect’ word-games, meaningless until meaning was
given to them by Macbeth’s response … The apparitions were spoken
clearly and directly by the watching company, with no attempt at
theatrical illusion, and Birnam Wood was merely a forest of drawn
swords.38</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Peter Hall production, Stratford 1967: the Macbeths crowned. Sharp
contrasts of darkness and light on the set emphasize a reading in terms
of primal good and evil.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although heavily criticized by some, this production’s staging
choices were praised by many for the way in which the audience were
forced to look at the play afresh. The absence of a sense of primordial
evil was perhaps a reaction against, or at least an alternative to, the
viewpoint presented by the groundbreaking Trevor Nunn production of
1976. By paring the play down to its essentials, Nunn created a palpable
intensity and brooding sense of evil, which never let up. A circle
painted on the floor of The Other Place studio theater encompassed the
action of the play. Used as the main acting space, it symbolized a magic
circle in which magicians stood for protection while conjuring and in
which the evil of Macbeth would be exorcised. It also represented the
“golden round,” the religious and ceremonial aspects of kinship.</p>
<p>Trevor Nunn used the opening scene to illustrate the powerful sense
apparent throughout the play of the forces of evil ranged against
goodness. While Duncan and his court were at prayer, the three witches
moved to the centre of the acting circle and began to groan and howl.
Their voices became louder, until they drowned out the pious
Duncan.39</p>
<p>Surrounded by darkness and with the absence of a formal raised stage,
the actors performed on a bare floor.</p>
<p>The audience—less than two hundred of them—sat on three sides of the
acting area, two rows deep and elevated above the floor by scaffolding …
The acting area was defined by a black painted circle round which the
actors sat on packing-crates when not engaged in the performance. The
audience could thereby see the witches outside the circle as they
watched Macbeth fulfilling their prophecies, and see Macduff sitting
ignorantly as his family is slaughtered … The cast was reduced to
fourteen (about the number used when Macbeth was first performed) and
there was some doubling. The audience … were so close to the actors that
an extraordinary intimacy was created between them, and the words could
be spoken quietly and subtly … the play was not so much about damnation
as about the minds of the characters … In such plain, austere
surrounding, the success of the production rested entirely on the
actors.40</p>
<p>The success of the sparse setting of this production led other
directors to reflect the psychological interior of their Macbeths in the
set design. Discarding the attempt to recreate any recognizable
interior, designers have sought to achieve a similar intimacy and
intensity on the main Royal Shakespeare Theatre stage. Jonathan Pryce,
who played Macbeth in 1986, said: “I don’t see this play set at some
particular point where it would have immediate relevance to any
particular society. It has resonances throughout time. When a play
offers an overview of the human psyche, it seems too narrow to confine
it.”41</p>
<p>In the production played by Pryce, directed by Adrian Noble, Bob
Crowley’s set “was an illusionist’s box where any number of conjuror’s
tricks might defeat the eye. Doors suddenly appeared, stairs shot out of
flush walls. Then the walls themselves began to move. The Macbeths’
world got smaller and smaller until it felt like a coffin.”42 The set
was variously described as a “claustrophobic pressure chamber”43 and an
empty box with “a recessed platform surrounded by blank timber walls. It
can be anywhere: a heath, the castle, the interior of the hero’s
skull.”44</p>
<p>In 1993, Derek Jacobi starred as Macbeth and director Adrian Noble,
returning to the play for a second time, made the lead performance the
focus of the whole production. Designer Ian MacNeil explained:</p>
<p>Derek is brilliant at taking you right inside someone’s head and
exploring their deepest thoughts and emotions. I think that set helps us
to do that. Its dark, interior quality allows the production to focus
upon what is private and metaphysical in the central character.
Basically the set is a black box … when colour is introduced it has far
greater impact. Lady Macbeth’s first entrance in a crimson dress, the
sumptuous banquet to greet Duncan’s arrival at Dunsinane, the dripping
blood on the hands of Macbeth and his wife, the Witches’ supernatural
pageant, the verdant colours of the scene in England, stand out
strikingly amidst the production’s brooding darkness.45</p>
<p>MacNeil designed a moving bridge that spanned the whole stage and
became the site for all the play’s magical elements. Piers Ibbotson, the
assistant director, described the concept: “the bridge provides a
physical manifestation of the play’s hierarchy—it shows the witches, and
later Banquo’s ghost, hovering over the affairs of men.”46</p>
<p>Considered by many to be a chamber piece, Macbeth appears to work
better on a more intimate stage. In 1999, Gregory Doran staged the play
in the Swan Theatre, a Jacobean-style playhouse built in 1986, which
seats around four hundred people. This production was widely considered
the best staging by the RSC since Trevor Nunn’s 1976 production at The
Other Place, a small black-box studio with an even smaller capacity. In
contrast to so many other productions, Doran and his designer set the
play in a very recognizable modern world: that of Eastern European
conflict.</p>
<p>Doran’s spare staging is played without interval and hurtles along at
tremendous, stomach-lurching speed. It’s also performed in modern dress,
and in its catalogue of horrors inevitably recalls the murderous strife
in former Yugoslavia. Doran never labours specific parallels, however,
creating instead an almost hallucinatory impression of the brutality and
horror that burns itself into the brain with the intensity of a bad
dream … the tension is constantly increased by Adrian Lee’s deeply
unsettling percussive score … Almost all the action is set in either
half light or murky darkness … There are shadows everywhere.47</p>
<p>Everything is on the move: uncertain, equivocal. The opening
words—the witches’ curses—are spoken in darkness. What look like sturdy
walls go bendy, as apparitions bulge out of them. When Birnam Wood comes
to Dunsinane it does so in such a crepuscular swirl that for a moment it
really does appear as an eerie event.48</p>
<p>The program notes were written by journalist and broadcaster Fergal
Keane, whose experience of reporting from the battlefields gave a unique
insight into Macbeth’s relevance at the end of the twentieth
century:</p>
<p>My life … has been a journey through the heartland of the warlords:
from Belfast to Pretoria, from Sarajevo to Kosovo, Rwanda to Cambodia, I
have met them—the men and women in whom ‘vaulting ambition o’erleaps
itself’ and any greater moral purpose or instinct for humanity. It has
been suggested—with grievous lack of insight—that Macbeth is not a play
relevant to our times. The truth is that I can hardly imagine a drama
more relevant in this age of bloody coups and civil wars. In this year
alone a once-trusted general has seized power in Pakistan; in Africa the
lords of the gun have been busy turning Congo into a wasteland; in East
Timor the warriors of General Wiranto’s Special Forces spent months
killing their enemies in advance of the referendum for independence.
Macbeth irrelevant? Never.49</p>
<p>Macbeth: Philosopher, Soldier, and Psychotic</p>
<p>The huge problem for players of Macbeth is to yoke together those
warring opposites of sensitivity and violence, deep depression and
coarse brutality. Some Macbeths have shot their bolts by the end of the
banquet scene; others save themselves for that fifth act which awaits
like the north face of the Eiger.50</p>
<p>On explaining the psychological difficulties of soldiers returning
from the First World War, the president of the British Psycho-Analytic
Association, Ernest Jones, explained that war constituted “an official
abrogation of civilized standards” in which men were not only allowed,
but encouraged “to indulge in behaviour of a kind that is throughout
abhorrent to the civilized mind … All sorts of previously forbidden and
hidden impulses, cruel, sadistic, murderous and so on, are stirred to
greater activity.”51 When we, and the weyard sisters, meet Macbeth, he
is halfway between the battlefield and home, physically and
psychologically unsettled, between two worlds. The sisters’ prophecy has
such a startling effect not only because of the regicidal thought that
it implants, but also because Macbeth knows what will happen if his
psychology of war becomes his domestic psychology, unleashing those
“forbidden and hidden impulses” without the constraints normally imposed
by the pressures of social conformity. He knows, exceptional warrior
that he is, that to cross this barrier will have diabolical
consequences.</p>
<p>In 1986, Jonathan Pryce played Macbeth as a psychotic waiting to
happen, as a “killing machine with an elegant turn of phrase.”52 The
exemplary soldier, used to obeying orders, his Macbeth was initially
passive: “To do anything he needs to be given an order. Hitherto he has
obeyed his king. Now he receives orders from elsewhere; they happen to
express his secret ambition.”53 His descent from dutiful soldier to a
“demon of nervous energy”54 was the centerpiece of the production. The
appalling change in Macbeth’s character had a powerful and frightening
effect. Sinead Cusack, who played Lady Macbeth, pointed out that “she
has no knowledge of the hell that she’s letting loose in his mind and
his life, and what he will become.”55 Whereas most Macbeths in
performance try to quickly adopt a mask to conceal their true feeling
about the prophecy, Pryce’s fainted at the news. His extreme reaction
perhaps indicated that he had not just thought about being king, but had
already thought about killing the king.</p>
<p>Pryce’s performance is a remarkable example of thinking the character
through from scratch. He presents us with a boisterous soldier long
tormented by ‘wicked dreams’ but dogged by personal insecurity; and
after the murder, he remains recognisably the same person.56 For a good
third of the action he maintains a mask of ingratiation—excessively
modest, ready with winning smiles … Even when the mask cracks it is only
by degrees, and it is not until the climax of the banquet—which he
diversifies with burlesque displays of lunacy to put the guests off the
scent—that the monster finally hatches out. He takes his wife’s hand for
the speech on ‘night’s black agents’ and finishes it with a
blood-curdling shriek that sends her staggering across the stage; then
bursts into laughter at his little joke.57</p>
<p>Sinead Cusack described how immediately after this Pryce showed the
disintegration of his character’s mind and the Macbeths’
relationship:</p>
<p>And then he smeared all my lipstick across my face. He put his hand
in my mouth and yanked down my jaw, mocking a kiss. It was a travesty of
the embrace, of how it used to be. He was throwing their sexuality back
in her face, saying, ‘That no longer has power in my life,’ scoffing at
her with that bark of a laugh. His mania was staggeringly dangerous and
she was terrified … And deeply hurt. Lost … He was completely gone from
me and he would never come back. It was a feeling of absolute
hopelessness.58</p>
<p>In contrast to Pryce, in 1993 Derek Jacobi, an actor known for
playing more sensitive characters, brought out the emotional complexity
of Macbeth. He focused on Macbeth’s psychological journey, reclaiming
him as tragic hero. Of Jacobi’s suitability to the role, director Adrian
Noble commented:</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Jonathan Pryce as Macbeth with the “apparition” of a child king
conjured up in Act 4 Scene 1: “He has no children”—unlike Duncan,
Banquo, Macduff, and Siward. Directed by Adrian Noble, 1986.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think he’s a natural Macbeth but not a natural psychopath. The idea
of the man being a psychopath has overlain our perception of the part.
If you take the psychopath out of it, the play is a metaphysical debate
about what is and what is not. His escalating hallucinations are a
metaphor in themselves. It takes in scenes explored in Lear and Hamlet
about madness, the fear of losing control. It’s also the best exposition
of tyranny and its methods ever written.59</p>
<p>Jacobi thoroughly examined Macbeth’s decline into evil by tracing the
disintegration of his civilian and domestic side, and the usurpation of
the better part of himself by the killer instincts that dominate him on
the battlefield:</p>
<p>Macbeth didn’t seem to me, at the start, to know more of evil than
any other soldier of his time who is used to killing people. What caught
my imagination was the effect of evil on him, the changes it brings
about. We spent a certain amount of time in rehearsal thinking about
what is frightening, what is palpably evil, what is out there; the
forces that seem to lurk malevolently around the world of the play. This
was an area we tried to work hard on, with as much psychological depth
as possible … ‘So foul and fair a day’ does not, it seems to me, refer
to the weather: ‘foul’ is about those heads he’s cut off and bowels he’s
ripped out; ‘fair’ is because it was all worth it, for this great
victory. That is the state of mind he is in, as, just by chance he
repeats the phrase that the witches have used … Because of the victory
he is in a state of high excitement and of emotional exhaustion. He has
been killing all day: he is covered with blood. In this state he gets
the news: in this state he must react to it. The speed with which things
happen in the next phase of the play is to a large extent conditioned by
Macbeth’s physical and mental state when he receives the witches’
greeting … We wanted to present a couple much in love and comfortable
with each other. We also wanted to show the contrast between Macbeth the
warrior, whose duty is killing and maiming, and Macbeth the husband, the
lover, the domestic, cultured man who dances and listens to music. Off
the battlefield he isn’t in the least gruff or brutal in his behaviour …
His first words are ‘My dearest love,’ a very romantic phrase, which he
doesn’t use again—his language to his wife becomes, indeed,
progressively less endearing.60</p>
<p>(The last point is questionable: the Macbeths are not seen onstage
together after the third act, during which Macbeth is still calling his
wife by the tender endearment “dearest chuck.”) According to critic
Irving Wardle:</p>
<p>Jacobi’s open-hearted soldier is also a machiavellian actor (leading
the applause for Malcolm’s election); his increasing hardness is matched
by his increasing vulnerability (as late as the cauldron scene you find
him nuzzling for comfort into a passing messenger); and finally this
clapped-out warlord regains all his original valor in the fight with
Macduff. What Jacobi achieves, thanks largely to his evocation of inner
horrors reinforced by a style of delivery that charges iambic lines with
sprung rhythm, is to reclaim Macbeth as a hero. Attention always focuses
on him; what happens to him matters more than what happens to anyone
else; even when organising the massacre of Macduff’s family he retains
his personal charm. The man who cancels his bond with humanity still
commands the sympathy of a morally indefensible reading.61</p>
<p>Jacobi also picked up on the fearfulness of Macbeth, his constant
awareness that he is slipping into evil:</p>
<p>I went through the play marking the times he speaks of fear,
particularly in relation to himself. He does so in every scene: it is
paramount for him, the man is constantly fearful … The moment before he
does the murder he is afraid—the dagger speech is a fearful speech, the
utterance of a terrified man. He does the murder for her, and it
destroys them both.62</p>
<p>“O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!”: fear exists because
the better part of himself is constantly resisting, fighting and at odds
with his actions. When he invokes “pity, like a naked new-born babe,”
this battle within Macbeth becomes wedded to the language:</p>
<p>His head is full of the mixture of good and evil. At this moment the
evil side of him, which we all possess, is getting the upper hand and in
order to balance it he brings up the best, the purest, the most innocent
images, of angels, and new-born babies, and the sky. They are all pure,
unsullied, wonderful images; goodness pours out of them; they’re
shining. And on the other side are the dark, blood-driven, evil, dank
thoughts.63</p>
<p>In order to remain sane, Jacobi’s Macbeth cut off the emotional side
of his life, something that Lady Macbeth could not do, no matter how she
willed it. Having given the order to murder Lady Macduff and her
children, this Macbeth went to inspect the aftermath. “That is the true
monstrousness; it is that appalling lack of emotion that he has to come
to terms with in the end.”64</p>
<p>Lady Macbeth: From Fiend-like Queen to Grieving Mother</p>
<p>The difficulty for any actress playing Lady Macbeth is the speed with
which she is thrown into delivering her most important speeches. There
is no buildup, no backstory: from the moment we see her, the actress has
to perfect the equivalent of a vertical takeoff. From her arresting
opening speech to her final madness, Lady Macbeth has a psychological
arc which has to be mapped in very few scenes.</p>
<p>Judi Dench played her as a woman obsessed with ambition:</p>
<p>Slinky costumes were replaced by a drab, black outfit which
effectively concealed hair and figure, leaving only hands and mobile
features visible … As she knelt in hoarse prayer to the spirits, her
demand to be filled with ‘direst cruelty’ suddenly appalled her. She
broke away with an animal squeal of terror, hands over her eyes, as if
she had come face to face with the fiend. She had no illusions about the
evil she was embracing, but the thrill of it drew her back. As she
reached a final, frantic ecstasy, arms outstretched to embrace the
darkness, they were ready to receive her husband on his unexpected
arrival.65</p>
<p>The power of the supernatural was palpable in this intense studio
production, and Lady Macbeth’s soliloquy came across as an incantation,
a spell. On her words “Hie thee hither,” Macbeth, as if magically
summoned, appeared onstage.</p>
<p>When discussing their conception of the part, most modern actresses
pick up on the idea that the Macbeths have lost a child, and build this
into their performance. This angle was heavily emphasized in Adrian
Noble’s 1986 production, which</p>
<p>reated the Macbeths—Jonathan Pryce and Sinead Cusack—as a childless
Strindbergian couple for whom power became a substitute for parenthood.
When Lady M taunted her husband with cowardice, he slapped her on the
face … the couple went on to clasp each other with fierce protectiveness
when she mentioned the loss of their child: you felt you were watching
an intimate domestic drama with immense political repercussions.66</p>
<p>Supplanting and subverting the social isolation, feelings of longing,
depression, loneliness, and utter desolation that can afflict parents
who desperately want a child, these Macbeths put their energies into a
twisted form of conception:</p>
<p>As rehearsals progressed, it was this bleak biological datum—‘He hath
no children’—that began to focus the tragedy. Macbeth became not so much
a political tragedy of multiple betrayal as a domestic drama, the
destruction of a marriage. Lacking children, the Macbeths’ energies
re-directed themselves into obsessions that travestied creativity: they
killed other people’s children, turning their kingdom into a wasteland.
But when they discovered what it meant to hold a barren sceptre, their
childlessness doubly mocked them. There could be no success without
succession … This Macbeth liked having children around. He liked
children’s games. The witches’ apparitions were children, seductive in
white nightgowns, playing blind man’s buff with the kneeling king on the
floor, giggling their predictions into his ear, then circling him in an
endless procession of Banquo’s future issue. These same white-gowned
children then became Macduff’s ambushed family. One of them sat on the
floor playing with the assassin’s bootstraps before he was picked up and
stabbed … such images found a contemporary expression for the evil that
the play is exploring. The abuse of children is the ultimate taboo, the
death of a child is the ultimate grief.67</p>
<p>Lady Macbeth sacrifices her womanhood to these “murdering ministers.”
She unsexes herself, suppressing femininity as she seeks to dry up the
“milk of human kindness” in both herself and her husband. Her punishment
is to be locked in her crime forever, with suicide the only escape. She
lives in a constant state of night—neither awake nor asleep, somewhere
between life and death (somnambulism was once thought to be the result
of demonic possession). In 1986, Sinead Cusack’s Lady Macbeth built into
the character a physical repulsion, a psychological nausea, prompted by
the sight of Duncan’s blood:</p>
<p>And then she sees the blood … something happens to her gut. For her,
the sight is horrible. It shocks her, the reality of it. She has
imagined the killing, but people who have visions are often shocked by
the reality when it comes … As an actress I tried to show just a little
click in my brain that I could store up to use and refer back to later
when I had blood on my own hands … After that we began talking different
languages. We who had needed to touch each other all the time grew
distant. When he had killed, neither of us wanted to touch each
other.68</p>
<p>Often portrayed in modern productions as a mutually dependent couple,
sexually and mentally intimate in their first scenes, this physical
awkwardness immediately after the murder points forward to the
disintegration of their relationship. In Adrian Noble’s 1993
production,</p>
<p>After Duncan’s killing, there’s a wonderful moment where you can see
the seeds of their future estrangement in the awkwardness of the embrace
they try to give one another, their intimacy badly hampered by the fact
that both of them have bloody hands. Then this Macbeth begins very
pointedly to exclude his wife from his deliberations. Watching them
seated at either end of the vast dining table after the banquet scene,
Lady Macbeth [Cheryl Campbell] stiffening as she hears of the
spy-network he has created, you get a desolate sense of the divergent
paths they will now take. The hero progresses to brutalising doggedness
… his wife to madness.69</p>
<p>Harriet Walter’s startling and powerful performance in 1999 combined
the elements of Lady Macbeth’s character that make her frightening, very
human, and ultimately pitiable: “She has a superb cold authority: her
analysis of her husband’s scruples is detached rather than scornful. But
the self-command isn’t overdone: you can always sense the ordinary
mortal behind it, the woman who eventually cracks.”70</p>
<p>Walter cleverly adopted a nervousness to her voice, the kind of throb
that only comes when a person tries to be something they are not. There
was a real sense of a woman whose potential psychosis had been
encouraged by isolation. With no means of support outside of her
husband, no network of companions of the kind that develops with the
social contact that surrounds children, this Lady Macbeth had had too
much time in a world of her own imagining. She came across as Macbeth’s
equal, aware of the evil she was invoking but drawn to it as a means of
revitalizing their marriage. The reference to the fact that she had
“given suck” was met with raw pain by man and wife as they reached
toward each other at the painful memory. The ending to the banquet scene
had an unusual emotional strength as it signaled the deteriorating minds
and marriage of this once intimate partnership:</p>
<p>At the end of the scene with Banquo’s ghost (here conjured up purely
by Sher’s crazed reactions) she subsides into terrible little sobbing
laughs with her husband that seem to be torn from her by the roots. It’s
like a ghastly parody of their former intimacy.71</p>
<p>Marginalized by power, she also acquires the pathos of internal exile
as she is excluded from her husband’s counsel; and the sleepwalking
scene, rather than a somnambulistic star turn, becomes a fearful
exploration of her disordered sub-conscious.72</p>
<p>Our understanding today of the psychology of war and post-traumatic
stress has informed modern productions of Macbeth. Many soldiers
sensitive to the injustices of war, who have witnessed terrible sights
and perpetrated terrible acts, suffer a mental shock that can lead to
insomnia, compulsive behavior, visions of violence and the dead coming
back to life. The irony for Macbeth is that these disturbances occur not
as a consequence of armed combat in the battlefield but as a result of
regicide in his own home. Having been “paltered with in a double sense,”
he has changed from war hero to dishonorable villain. His acute
awareness of this is what makes him continue to be human. By the same
account, Lady Macbeth’s mental anguish is intensified to unbearable
levels because the feelings of compassion and humanity that she has
tried to repress cannot be extinguished. No one who heard it will ever
forget the noise, somewhere between an animal whimper and an existential
howl, that Judi Dench conjured out of herself in the sleepwalking
scene.</p>
<p>THE DIRECTOR’S CUT: INTERVIEWS WITH TREVOR NUNN, GREGORY DORAN, AND
RUPERT GOOLD</p>
<p>Sir Trevor Nunn is the most successful and one of the most highly
regarded of modern British theater directors. Born in 1940, he was a
brilliant student at Cambridge, strongly influenced by the literary
close reading of Dr. F. R. Leavis. At the age of just twenty-eight he
succeeded Peter Hall as Artistic Director of the RSC, where he remained
until 1978. He greatly expanded the range of the company’s work and its
ambition in terms of venues and touring. He also achieved huge success
in musical theater and subsequently became artistic director of the
National Theatre in London. His productions are always full of textual
insights, while being clean and elegant in design. Among his most
admired Shakespearean work has been a series of tragedies with Ian
McKellen in leading roles: Macbeth (1976, with Judi Dench, in the dark,
intimate space of The Other Place), Othello (1989, with McKellen as Iago
and Imogen Stubbs as Desdemona), and King Lear (2007, in the Stratford
Complete Works Festival, on world tour, and then in London). The Macbeth
discussed here is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most
influential productions of the twentieth century and a version of it was
filmed.</p>
<p>Gregory Doran, born in 1958, studied at Bristol University and the
Bristol Old Vic theater school. He began his career as an actor, before
becoming associate director at the Nottingham Playhouse. He played some
minor roles in the RSC ensemble before directing for the company, first
as a freelance, then as associate and subsequently chief associate
director. His productions, several of which have starred his partner
Antony Sher, are characterized by extreme intelligence and lucidity. He
has made a particular mark with several of Shakespeare’s lesser-known
plays and the revival of works by his Elizabethan and Jacobean
contemporaries. His 1999 Macbeth, with Sher and Harriet Walter in the
leading roles, was highly acclaimed and a version of it was filmed.</p>
<p>Rupert Goold was born in 1977. He studied at Cambridge and was an
assistant director at the Donmar Warehouse under Sam Mendes. After
undertaking a range of experimental work, in 2006–07 he directed two
highly acclaimed Shakespearean productions with the veteran stage and
television actor Patrick Stewart: The Tempest, part of the RSC’s
year-long Complete Works Festival, and the intimate modern-dress Macbeth
at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester, which transferred to London’s West
End, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and finally Broadway. It garnered
multiple awards in London and was nominated for six Tony awards in New
York. In 2009 Goold became an associate director of the RSC.</p>
<p>At the end of the play Malcolm describes the Macbeths as a “dead
butcher” and his “fiend-like queen”: but there’s got to be more to them
than that, hasn’t there? In the case of Lady Macbeth in particular,
there’s a long tradition of actresses wrestling with her human side
(“Had he not resembled / My father,” and all that).</p>
<p>Nunn: In many ways, Macbeth concentrates thematically on the nature
of evil, and therefore, the play is also, through the strands of the
Banquo story and the Malcolm/Macduff story climaxing in the England
scene, about the nature of goodness. But something else explains the
structure of the play, and binds its many elements together; it is an
examination of belief, or as we more commonly say, faith. The
successful, highly regarded, trustworthy general Macbeth is inclined to
believe the weyard sisters encountered on the heath, and equally clearly
his comrade and friend Banquo is not. When the first element of the
sisters’ strange prophecy comes true, Macbeth is persuaded entirely to
believe in their prophetic utterances, to the point of writing to his
wife about this “road to Damascus” revelation. She is obviously more
than willing to be recruited to this belief, and thereafter she clings
to it as extremely as a fundamentalist terrorist to religious
validation.</p>
<p>Macbeth’s waverings endanger both him and his wife, to the point
where his belief in the prophecies has to be revitalized if he is to go
on. His return visit to the witches, indicating that, despite the bad
news about Fleance, Macbeth is invulnerable, fuels the final section of
the play, as the invading warriors imbued with the opposite (and very
Christian) faith are carried along by their own certainties. The end
comes in the form of a “bad joke” as the revitalized Macbeth realizes
that the phrase “born of woman,” which will protect him against
all-comers, doesn’t include a child entering the world by means of a
primitive Caesarean. Macbeth’s next words, after taking in that his
faith has been founded on a semantic quibble, are “I’ll not fight with
thee.” His belief has dissolved, and with it his resolution, his
invulnerability, and his sense of destiny.</p>
<p>Doran: Lady Macbeth is certainly not a “fiend-like queen.” I think
she is driven to do something that she doesn’t allow herself to think
through; she has a kind of myopia. Whereas Macbeth thinks rather a
lot—too much, in a way—she suppresses her imagination. Lady Macbeth has
only one very short soliloquy in the entire play, when she realizes that
she has become queen at the cost of having blood on her hands:</p>
<p>Naught’s had, all’s spent,</p>
<p>Where our desire is got without content:</p>
<p>’Tis safer to be that which we destroy</p>
<p>Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.</p>
<p>I think she realizes that her husband no longer has any real use for
her. At the end of the banquet scene she realizes that Macbeth has left
her, he has moved on, and is going to continue to secure himself as king
and eliminate his enemies. She seems to have no knowledge of his plans
anymore. We discovered a moment whereby she picked up a candle to light
her way to her bedchamber as she left the banqueting table and all the
other candles went out; it was the influence of the three weyard
sisters, who had been under the table all the time. In other words, Lady
Macbeth is haunted by her conscience, and what Harriet [Walter] made
clear in the sleepwalking scene is that here is a woman who has insisted
that her husband do this terrible deed in order to get the crown, and
then immediately finds both the emptiness of the role and also that her
relationship with her husband has somehow diminished. And I think that
is very poignant.</p>
<p>As for Macbeth as a “butcher,” the experience of watching the play is
that you don’t feel Macbeth is just a ruthless tyrant. That’s partly due
to how he is haunted and how the play’s imagery supports that. He says,
“O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!” and “They have tied me to
a stake: I cannot fly,” as if he is some terrible bear chained to a
stake and attacked by dogs. The imagery supports his status as almost a
victim. You get a sense in performance that once he has realized the sin
he has committed, his struggle to carry on living makes him worthy of
our pity. And Lady Macbeth’s sleepwalking scene, where you see how much
she is being punished by her own conscience, is a devastating portrayal
of a human soul in disintegration.</p>
<p>Goold: History is written by the victors, and so in one sense that is
all they are. One of the things the play seems to be exploring is the
tension between social and political identity versus the individual
psyche. However, in Lady Macbeth’s case I also always thought that it
was important that she was, to a certain degree, a two-dimensional
character—a “fiend-like queen.” It is her single-minded remorseless
ambition that is set against Macbeth’s huge complexity. Too often I
think great actresses try and give backstory or humanity to a woman who,
while we can pity her hugely, never shows us she is more than a
psychopath. It is that chilling viciousness that makes the part so
iconic and so potent.</p>
<p>How did you invoke the sense of the supernatural for a modern
audience who might be more skeptical about those aspects of the play
than theatergoers would have been in Shakespeare’s day?</p>
<p>Nunn: My production dressed Duncan more as a priest than a military
king, so that he had an iconic, rather papal aura which not only
suggested a prevailing religious conformity in the social structure, but
accentuated the heinous and unthinkable quality of the murder. Apart
from that emphasis, there was very little of a hieratic nature in the
presentation because extreme naturalistic credibility was the aim and
intention of all that we did with a text rich in imagery, but equally
daring in the use of slang, conversational rhythm, interrupted thought,
and the vocabulary of domestic squabble. In The Other Place, it was
possible to speak without projection, indeed to whisper and be heard by
everyone, and this gave a sense for the audience not so much of being at
a play as of overhearing conversations which put everybody present in
equal danger. When Macbeth and Lady Macbeth were at the point of
committing the murder of Duncan, I had placed all the other actors at
vantage points invisibly around the theater, and asked them to breathe
heavily, as if sleeping. The effect, of a silence so profound that
people peacefully and innocently asleep in the house could be clearly
heard, was genuinely gripping and terrifying, as well as prefiguring
Macbeth’s nightmare that he will sleep no more, that he has murdered
sleep. Ian McKellen and Judi Dench were quite extraordinary in their
ability to observe the rules of the text but make exchanges like this
seem totally naturalistic, almost improvised. This “experience” of sleep
also connected to Lady Macbeth sleepwalking in her fitful confessional,
which again we tried to make as real as if caught on a hospital CCTV
camera.</p>
<p>Doran: I noticed that the word “fear” (and linked to it “afraid,”
“fearsome,” “fearful”) is a very important theme in the play. At the
beginning of rehearsals I got everybody in the company to describe a
time when they had been really afraid: afraid for their safety, the
safety of their children; afraid of spiders, heights, whatever. People
described in detail their experiences of fear and we tried to tap into
the reality of what that experience is: what it does to the human body;
what it does to your breath; and how we could communicate that sense of
fear.</p>
<p>In terms of how to get the audience to feel that fear, we decided
very early to play the first scene—the very short scene with the three
witches—in total darkness. When we suddenly turned all the lights out,
including the exit signs, so there was total blackout, we discovered
that people have a very primal attitude to darkness. I once did Peter
Shaffer’s Black Comedy at the Donmar. The play opens with the very
interesting convention that the lights don’t go on and you hear the
characters talking as if they’re in full light, and then suddenly all
the lights go on and the characters continue the rest of the play as if
they are in total darkness. At the first preview I made sure there was a
total blackout and stood at the back of the auditorium to make sure that
nobody came in and broke it. Within a minute or two a lady scuttled up
the aisle and banged into me, trying to get out because she couldn’t
tolerate the darkness. I thought if that can happen in a sixties’ light
comedy, perhaps I ought to use it for Macbeth!</p>
<p>So for the first scene we suddenly went to blackout and, after people
had got over their initial shock, it was a very eerie experience. We
then heard the witches talking in the darkness. When you see the witches
for the first time people often think, “Oh, so that’s how they’re doing
the witches.” The fact that you couldn’t see them gave the scene a real
intensity. It made you really listen to it. In the early previews we
dropped in three little amplifiers at exactly the height where the
witches would have been standing. The actors were backstage and their
voices came through via microphone. Then when they said “Hover through
the fog and filthy air,” we flew out the amplifiers over the audience’s
heads, so that what you thought was the voice of a woman in front of you
suddenly flew over your head. But it was so freaky, and people became so
disturbed by it, only a minute or two into the play, that we decided it
was too much.</p>
<p>I think as always with Shakespeare part of what we were trying to do
was surprise people: make them think that something was what they
thought it was and then suddenly it was not. The whole back wall of the
Swan was in fact a fake back wall. Everybody knew the Swan, it looked
like the wall of the Swan, but when we came to the apparition scene
suddenly the apparitions pushed through the wall. The wall had sections
which were painted and textured like brick, but were actually made of
wetsuit material, so that when the actors pushed their faces into it
they came through the wall. Something solid suddenly became fluid. Then
at the end of the banquet, just as Lady Macbeth left the stage with her
candle, all of the other candles left on the table suddenly, magically,
went out. In fact it was the witches, who had been hidden under the
table through the entire scene, pulling the wicks down through the
table. Then they threw the table up and appeared to the audience. It
shocked them silly because the chairs went flying and the banquet table
suddenly flew into the air. We then went straight on into the next scene
where Macbeth visits the witches.</p>
<p>We took all those moments and tried genuinely to work out how you
frighten an audience, and how to create the equivalent effect that
Shakespeare suggests for a skeptical modern audience.</p>
<p>Goold: I always felt the key to the supernatural was less in finding
a modern correlative than in playing up the political world in which the
play operates. Ghosts, witches, and visions are fearsome in their own
right, but what makes them terrifying is when they prey on the minds of
political figures in positions of power. They are manifestations of
political crisis as much as a paranormal worldview, so we just always
tried to ground and make detailed the paranoid police state that
Scotland becomes in the play and that seemed to make the supernatural
all the more shocking.</p>
<p>More specifically, the weird or “weyard” sisters have been variously
played as old hags, classical Fates, alluring nymphs, and many
interpretations in-between: how did you and your cast set about
realizing them?</p>
<p>Nunn: It was very important in our production that “the witches” were
entirely believable, not just to Macbeth but to everybody in the
audience. I think this production was the very first small-scale
intimate staging of the play, to an audience of about two hundred,
ranged on three sides of the action. It was also played without interval
(whether that had been done before, I don’t know) so the black mass
ritual meticulously observed by the three witches at the very beginning
set up a disturbing atmosphere from which there was no escape until the
glimmer of Christianity arrived like a fragile dawn at the end. The
sisters were varied in age, a senior white-haired witch very much in
control of the proceedings. A second witch, of an age to be her
daughter, took instruction from the elder, but both of these were
dependent on the third, who was young enough to be the third generation.
She it was who became tranced, and provided each time the visionary or
prophetic information. We redistributed the lines designated First,
Second, and Third in the Folio so that each sister’s contribution was
specific and in character, and so that we avoided generalized
ghoulishness or choric posturing. They were individuals and they were
believable.</p>
<p>Doran: We decided that it’s the wrong way round with Macbeth to try
and begin with the witches. It’s not a society terrorized by the
witches. It’s a society which has produced the witches and made them
scapegoats. It is interesting that the greatest witch persecutions have
happened at times of civil crisis: during the Civil War, for example.
There is the sense that at such times we require these targets to give
vent to our national fears. The weyard sisters became for us a product
of the fear already existing in society, rather than something that was
making that society afraid. The way we tried to do that was to look at
the weyard sisters from their point of view. I rehearsed them separately
from the rest of the play, so that whenever we rehearsed their scenes I
would work with the weyard sisters beforehand and we would decide how
they would play the scene, but we wouldn’t tell the other actors. We
tried one idea that the witches couldn’t speak until they were asked a
question, and they needed Macbeth to ask them that question. Then when
he addressed them they could reveal their understanding of the future to
him. The problem was that Banquo then asked the question as well, and
they also had to tell him the future, which messed up their plan. Other
days we tried other aspects of the witches: their vindictiveness; or
perhaps their heightened sexuality; or we would try exploring the idea
that they were high on drugs. But the other actors never know the route
the witches had taken; the weirdness of the way they performed was all
that was apparent to them. That meant that they remained this outside
group. In rehearsal we never called them witches. Other people did, but
they referred to themselves as the weyard sisters. We took their own
personal agendas very seriously, so that they were real people, with
real appetites.</p>
<p>The strangeness of the witches of course keeps the play ticking with
this terrible undertow of fear. We had them make one or two extra
appearances. At the moment when Banquo and Fleance are attacked by
robbers while out riding, we had the witches silently watching. Right at
the end of the play we see Malcolm become king. But of course the
witches tell Banquo that his offspring will become king, so we finished
the play with Fleance arriving with one of the trinkets that he had
found from the witches, and clearly thinking “My time will come.” So
there was this sense of an endless cycle of violence and
retribution.</p>
<p>Goold: The sisters are by far the hardest thing to get right in the
play, not least because they dominate the opening act, and yet their
second scene, with the tale of the pilot and his wife, is impenetrable,
extraneous, and poorly written (probably by Middleton). I longed to cut
it, but the witches have to establish themselves if they are to
resonate, so a solution has to be found. I took inspiration from Wes
Craven, who said he came up with Freddy Krueger by thinking about when
people felt safest and then threatening that (sleep, in the case of A
Nightmare on Elm Street). For most sensibilities a neutral watchful
chorus of blank Norns [in Norse myth, the three goddesses of fate] is
attractive, but the problem with the witches is that they just have to
be evil, petty, and vicious—the text only supports that reading. For a
variety of reasons I hit on the idea of them being nurses—again, people
we trust and look to in times of need and custodians of life and death
in most people’s lives, so more problematic if they are evil. Nurses
would also be needed in the warfare of the first act and so would fit in
unnoticed around a battlefield. That was something very important to me;
I had always felt the first act of the play can be very bitty in
performance—the leaping locations, the complexity of the civil war
backstory, and the sheer challenge of the language in the opening scenes
can all make the play hard to get into. I had a hunch that creating two
long opening scenes, one in a field hospital and the next in the kitchen
of Glamis castle, would give the piece a slower, more monumental growth
and then allow the play’s action to accelerate from Act 3 on. I also
think it is a mistake to have the witches ever-present, which is what
blights so many fringe and regional productions where the witches have
to double as everything from Fleance to the various doctors. While this
can have moments of seeming insight, most of the time it is both
distracting and robs the witches of part of their power: that we meet
them so rarely and yet with such amazing force each time we do. So, to
return to our production, I interpolated the witches’ first scene at the
exit of the bloody sergeant for surgeons. The sergeant, who had been
attended throughout by the three nurses trying to minister to his
wounds, found himself alone with his angels not of mercy but of death.
They killed him, his part in their story served, and then removed their
surgical masks to ask when they would meet again. A manipulative
revision, but Macbeth is such a well-known play and the opening scene
such a familiar cliché that I hoped our surprise relocation would make
an audience listen harder rather than sit back and listen to the
familiar thunderclaps and cackling. The final bonus of the nurses idea
was in the very British desire to see our hospital sisters as sexually
provocative, and I’m sure Shakespeare had that in mind when he wrote the
weyard sisters.</p>
<p>Just after the murder of Duncan is discovered, Macbeth makes a slip
that almost implicates him, but attention is distracted by the line
“Look to the lady”—what’s happening here? Does Lady Macbeth faint or
pretend to faint (how could an audience tell the difference?) or could
she throw up or do something else?</p>
<p>Nunn: Unquestionably, Lady Macbeth is the better of the two at
handling the immediate aftermath of the murder, and so we made it clear
that her “fainting” was a vitally necessary device to prevent the
questioning of her husband from going any further. However, something
entirely unforeseen changes her ability to handle such situations; her
husband begins to exclude her from his thoughts and plans, and so, at
the very time when she feels they most need each other, he rejects her,
one senses for the first time, in their intense marital relationship. So
what we watch in the middle reaches of the play is not only the
creation, step by step, of a tyrant dictator, but even more upsettingly,
the breakup of a marriage.</p>
<p>Doran: I believe that Lady Macbeth faints. I don’t think it’s a ploy
to distract from her husband. She doesn’t really rescue him from his
mistake because suspicion is still clearly focused towards him. It’s the
moment that the reality of what Lady Macbeth has done suddenly happens
upon her, and she passes out. I think it is at that point that Macbeth
ceases to trust her and begins to use her, and so it is a crucial point.
I think the enormity of the crime as it is described brings back the
image of her dead father and she isn’t able to deal with it, or with the
accumulated pressure from events around her.</p>
<p>Goold: As you say, the difference is impossible for the audience to
detect, but we played it as a genuine faint. We went with the idea that
Macbeth, as a soldier, would know how to kill Duncan—a quick stab or two
to the vital organs—and that the “gashed stabs” he describes are
inflicted by the bloodthirsty Lady Macbeth when she returns the daggers.
So in our production he entered from the murder with only a few streaks
of blood on his hands but when she returned she looked like she had been
bathing in an abattoir. His speech then, which precipitates the faint,
was played as an accusation in part to her for her violence, which he
has only just witnessed with Lennox. That became the start of his active
separation from her and precipitated the faint along with Lady Macbeth
being forced to re-see the murder through his description. We also
played the second of Banquo’s quo’s “Look to the lady” as an aside and
warning to Macduff. He is trying to tell the Thane of Fife that he
suspects Lady Macbeth may be at the root of the crime.</p>

</ol>
<p>The text seems to support the view that Lady Macbeth has lost a child
in the past. Do you agree, and what implications did this have for her
character and the relationship between the Macbeths in your production?
Children and childlessness do keep recurring in the play, don’t
they?</p>
<p>Nunn: Duncan has children to inherit his crown. Banquo has a child
who will be the progenitor of a line of kings. Macduff has children, who
can be used to cause the ultimate suffering for the father’s disloyalty.
Macbeth, essential to Shakespeare’s scheme, has no children. The glimpse
that we are given of a past time of joy and sublimation for the Macbeths
in the passing reference to “I have given suck” sets up unspoken
reverberations which are vast, as we realize that childlessness is
possibly the prime cause for Macbeth craving power in lieu of a future
investment in the next generation. Clearly that backstory of the lost
child is vital for developing the character of Lady Macbeth, and the use
of the image of the baby at the breast, so painfully part of their
shared marital history, in demanding action from her husband, shows how
extreme she is prepared to be. But as with all offstage events, I think
it would be a mistake to give that strand of the story a prominence that
is never articulated in the text. Shakespeare provides us with a
suggestion and I would recommend that therefore it’s what he wants, the
tip and not the iceberg.</p>
<p>Doran: Because Lady Macbeth says “I have given suck, and know / How
tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me,” she clearly has had a child
before. It seemed to us to be most fruitful to decide that this was a
child that the Macbeths have had and which has died, rather than being
either a fantasy on her part or the child of another marriage. Also
later on Macduff says “he has no children,” after Macbeth has slain
Macduff’s entire family. We spent a lot of time with Antony Sher and
Harriet Walter [who played the Macbeths] discussing what this meant, and
we decided that this was a taboo subject for them, which they had
suppressed; they had never talked about it. That is why it is at that
crucial moment, as Macbeth decides while the king is banqueting that he
can no longer go ahead with their proposed plan to murder him, that she
brings up the subject. It focuses his mind and makes him realize how
serious she is. That became crucial to the playing of the scene. Because
they couldn’t have children the Macbeths required something else in
which to pour their energies, which they thought would be the crown. The
dead child became a catalyst in their decision to go ahead with the
plan. So from that point of view it was very important.</p>
<p>We also extended the idea. When Lady Macbeth welcomes Duncan to
Dunsinane, we had Macduff there with his wife and their children. As
Lady Macduff, this fecund woman with all her pretty children, passed
Lady Macbeth, Harriet gave her a very wan smile, and you could tell that
children were something she desperately wanted, but that now, somehow
because of her dead child, was unable to have. This was a moment on
which we were able to focus particularly in the filmed version. So the
lack of children in Lady Macbeth’s world became very important for us.
She needed to replace that with some other ambition.</p>
<p>Goold: Is the child even Macbeth’s? In the sources there is a
suggestion she has been married before and Macbeth is the conqueror of
her previous husband. We talked about the issue a lot in rehearsal but
in playing it seemed to lose its significance, at least for Lady
Macbeth, who never mentions it again; when in her sleepwalking she
acknowledges the crimes against Macduff, it is more for the loss of his
wife than his children. I think it haunts the childless Macbeth more,
and I always found his fear that Banquo would come to the crown, “No son
of mine succeeding,” very moving. In our production we had a significant
age gap between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth and so sex was more significant
than children. Child-killers are, though, a recurrent theme from the
murder attempt on Fleance, through to the Macduffs and by way of the sow
“that hath eaten / Her nine farrow.” We tried to accentuate the
vulnerability of children by having Macduff and his wife and family
arrive on the night of Duncan’s murder, to put their family in the
foreground prior to the Lady Macduff scene.</p>
<p>How did you stage the banquet scene where Macbeth is confronted by
Banquo’s ghost that only he can see?</p>
<p>Nunn: Staying true to the principle that everything must be entirely
credible in our small space, I decided that the ghost of Banquo must be
only in Macbeth’s mind at the banquet, just as the dagger that he saw
before him was no such thing. I remember we rehearsed the scene with
Banquo there, before removing him, so that Ian McKellen could gauge
precisely what he would do if he discovered a corpse accusing him at his
dinner table. The impact in performance was truly upsetting, one might
say sickening, as I think no lighting effect or ghostly makeup would
have been.</p>
<p>Doran: Macbeth dismissed a servant to get some wine to fill up
everybody’s goblets so they could make a toast. When he turned around to
see the servant return it was actually Banquo, who then disappeared
amongst the guests. That was quite freaky for the audience. They knew
the man coming back was the servant, but then suddenly when they looked
he had turned into Banquo. It created quite a shock.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>The Macbeths have only each other: Antony Sher and Harriet Walter in
Gregory Doran’s 1999 production.</li>
</ol>
<p>Goold: For ages I wrestled with the twin academic positions: that one
needs to see the ghost and so feel the full horror of the scene for
Macbeth; and on the other hand, that we should never see him so we can
focus on the scorpions in Macbeth’s mind. Then I looked at the scene
again and realized it was close to where the interval, if there is to be
one, is usually taken (at the end of this scene). This gave me the idea
of playing the scene twice—once where we see the ghost and then again
when we don’t. So we took the interval at a hugely intense moment as the
blood-boltered Banquo strode down the table to challenge his king having
descended in a lift bleeding all over the walls (in a shameless steal
from The Shining!). We then returned, replayed the scene from the start
with some minor changes (the dialogue between Macbeth and the murderer
was inaudible the second time, so we focused on the guests and the
excluded Lady Macbeth), and then at the moment the ghost arrived we saw
nothing. We then stayed in Macbeth’s world until we found another moment
for a sudden and shocking arrival of the ghost at an unexpected moment
later in the scene.</p>
<p>And what about the Porter?</p>
<p>Nunn: We were very fortunate in having the young Iain McDiarmid as
the Porter, and we used his Scottishness to the full, not to mention his
flamboyant comedic bravura. He was a very real, hungover, cussed Porter,
but he spoke directly to the audience, involving them and almost forcing
them to laugh in the midst of their distress and grief at what they had
just witnessed. As he does in so many of the plays—like the Clown
bringing the asp to Cleopatra—Shakespeare lightens the tone just before
he darkens it to something even deeper than it was.</p>
<p>Doran: The Porter is a great moment; suddenly there is this
unexpected, funny scene right at the height of the drama, the tragedy,
and the tension. It’s a brilliant device. The difficulty is to make it
funny, because the jokes, about Henry Garnet and Jesuits, are very
topical. We had a rather brilliant actor called Stephen Noonan who
happened to be a very clever imitator, so I allowed him a bit of leeway.
He did use the text but he would talk to the audience. When it came to
the line “What are you?” occasionally some people replied, for example
with “I’m a teacher,” and that gave him license to say “Well, you’re
certainly going to hell,” or whatever. There was one wonderful moment
one night when he said, “What are you?” to a lady on the front row. She
replied “Is this in the play?” and Steve said, “Well, I’m in the play.”
It was a great, sort of weird, Pirandellian moment! He also did
impersonations of Tony Blair as the equivocator, which of course at the
time, as any politician was saying white is black and black is white,
seemed to be very appropriate. It caught the mood of the Porter scene.
Mind you, our playing time was one hour fifty-eight, but it could
stretch to two hours and seven minutes depending on how long the Porter
went on! He crashed out of a trap on the stage, and he was a very
violent, disgusting creature who was both intimidating and hilariously
funny. What we tried to do was translate the topical allusions and the
weird freshness of the wit while using as much of the text as possible
to do that. I think in the film version he uses virtually all of the
text.</p>
<p>Goold: The first speech is impenetrable and cursed because people
expect it to be funny. We made the familiar double with Seyton and just
tried to make him as scary and threatening as possible: the kind of
morbid thug who would usually end up in prison in a well-balanced
society but in times of strife and chaos finds himself working the gas
chambers. It is indicative of Macbeth’s employ that he has hired such a
man—perhaps an old soldier. The comedy must have been electric in 1606
after the publicity surrounding the execution of the original
equivocator Father Garnet, but unless one allows the actor to
improvise—something we tried but that never seemed quite right—it’s very
hard. I have some truck with the idea that the comedy is necessary, not
to lighten or change the mood in the play but to introduce the scabrous
bleak humor that will eventually consume the nihilistically ironic
Macbeth in Act 5.</p>
<p>The text is a lot shorter than is the case in Shakespeare’s other
tragedies, so you don’t have to cut so much—and some productions have
achieved great intensity by having no interval. By the same account,
some of the most successful productions have had the intimacy of chamber
or black-box productions: were pace and claustrophobia among the
qualities you looked for?</p>
<p>Doran: Absolutely they were. We really learned that from Trevor
Nunn’s 1976 production. We were able to play it in the Swan very fast
without an interval. Shakespeare didn’t have intervals, but of course he
quite often gives the lead actor a big scene off in Act 4. Macbeth has
the England scene when he can relax. I think the only cut we made was
Hecate, because I’m sure that’s a bit of Middleton; it seems to me to be
inferior.</p>
<p>I think somebody once said that, in Macbeth, if anyone had time to
think the events wouldn’t happen. The furious pace of the text is
crucial; things happen in this terrible whirlwind. The claustrophobia of
the play is intensified by Shakespeare’s lighting effects; he’s
brilliant at lighting his own plays. There isn’t a single scene in
Macbeth that takes place in daylight. At the beginning of the England
scene Malcolm says, “Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there /
Weep our sad bosoms empty.” And there is one scene between the old man
and Ross where “by th’clock, ’tis day, / And yet dark night strangles
the travelling lamp.” It’s always dark and gloomy. The shadows
Shakespeare creates we fill with our own fear, therefore the
claustrophobia and the darkness of the play are crucial. It’s famously a
play that is often better when you read it than when you see it in the
theater, because of that complicity of your imagination. If you can in
performance suggest, allow the audience to engage their own fear, they
will fill those shadows with their own dark imaginings. That
contribution, the intensity of the audience’s reaction, increases the
tension of the play.</p>
<p>Goold: Claustrophobia is vital, at least in Acts 1, 2, and 5. Our
production opened in the three-sided Minerva Studio in Chichester, and
so from the start we knew we had to effectively stage the play on a
single set—in our case, a space that was part-hospital, part-kitchen,
and part-morgue. However, the claustrophobia must be unusual, and one of
our greatest successes was in Howard Harrison’s bright, hard lighting
throughout the play that stopped the crepuscular gloom that many
productions (and actors!) get lost in. Kubrick’s 2001 is hugely
claustrophobic but searingly bright, as is Ridley Scott’s Alien. Pace
was something that I felt much more ambivalent about. I know that the
received wisdom is to play Macbeth pell-mell but I guess you have to
respond to your actors. Patrick Stewart, older than many Macbeths and
exploring that sense of mortality throughout, brought to the role his
own thoughtful and intense charisma—one that counterpointed well with
Kate Fleetwood’s quicksilver fury as Lady Macbeth. I always felt the
play would fight back if we got too measured—and it often did, but
almost always in Acts 3 and 5—but that we shouldn’t set out to turn up
the speed without letting the language out first. After all, we see
gripping, pacy murder stories all the time; what distinguishes Macbeth
into a league shared maybe only with Crime and Punishment is the depth
of its interior psychology. These things shouldn’t always be rushed.</p>
<p>The one scene where the pace seems to flag is that at the English
court. But then this interlude is particularly important for the
development of Malcolm and Macduff, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Nunn: It was vital to the scheme of my production that full weight
was given to the England scene, where an opposite set of beliefs, under
the patrimony of a deeply religious king, is developed in necessary
contradiction to the things that Macbeth in repeated soliloquy has been
encouraging us to think. Nevertheless, I proposed cutting some elements
of the scene, but much inspired by the arguments of Bob Peck as Macduff
and Roger Rees as Malcolm, a number of my proposed cuts were restored. I
had reduced the amount of testing of Macduff by Malcolm, but if there
was any one individual who led the movement toward a less recited, more
instant coinage of Shakespeare’s language at Stratford at this time, it
was the late and deeply lamented Bob Peck; it was his example that led
to the scene having a centrality that only the requirements of
television editing were able to compromise.</p>
<p>Doran: In the England scene I think Shakespeare allows you to debate
what it is that we require our rulers to be. One of the difficult things
about the early part of the play is that Scotland in Macbeth’s time is
not a country where kings succeed through primogeniture, so although
Malcolm becomes the Prince of Cumberland, it isn’t an automatic choice
that Duncan would choose him or his son as the next king. Indeed at that
point, because Macbeth has performed in such an extraordinary fashion in
routing the enemy, everybody expects that he will be rewarded and
perhaps nominated as the next king. So there is a slight sense that in a
way he was robbed of the crown, which of course he then seizes through
devious means. But then we are asked to consider whether Malcolm himself
is appropriate to be leader of the country. The trick that Malcolm plays
on Macduff of pretending he is a deeply flawed character forces Macduff
to decide whether a man of such low morals should indeed accept the
throne. That shift of perspective is important for the audience to see a
larger canvas; not just to involve themselves in how Macbeth has hacked
his way to the throne, but to inquire what it is that we want our
monarch, our rulers, to be. It’s about good government.</p>
<p>Goold: A brilliant scene and one that in any other play with less
bravura theatricality would be celebrated. I’ve always felt it suffers
from undercasting—particularly if the actor playing Malcolm is
inexperienced. Because Patrick was an older Macbeth we had an older
company than usual, and so in Scott Handy had an actor of huge
experience and talent in classical theater. This is a scene that focuses
on what was for me the thematic heart of the play—what it is to be a
man. Questions of masculinity haunt the play—Lady Macbeth wishes she
were a man, she mocks her husband’s lack of manliness, he dares “do all
that may become a man: / Who dares do more is none.” Here, in the
longest scene in the play, Malcolm explores for himself and in role-play
what his own masculinity is and how it might be exposed as a king but
also how inexperienced and unmanly he truly is. Then at the most
heartbreaking moment in Shakespeare, when Macduff hears of his family’s
slaughter, Malcolm urges him to “Dispute it like a man” (what a martial
and British sentiment! The fear of the unmanly tears of compassion!) and
Macduff reminds us that true manliness lies at the margins of this
brutal, sexualized, ferocious play when he declares “I shall do so / But
I must also feel it as a man.” It’s a great scene. It will always
struggle after the sensationalism of the apparitions and the Lady
Macduff murder in terms of sheer theatricality, but good actors and
being brave with the pacing will make it a rich and profound experience.
Two particular moments in our production stood out for me: one was
Malcolm’s exploration of the princely virtues, which we played as an
initial retort but that became a slow and terrified exploration of his
own potential inadequacy. The other was a bold and almost two-minute
pause we took after Macduff receives the news of his family’s slaughter
and Malcolm says “Merciful heaven!” After this agonizing awkward hiatus,
Malcolm whispered: “What, man, ne’er pull your hat upon your brows: /
Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak / Whispers the
o’er-fraught heart and bids it break.” Beautiful transcendent lines in a
transcendent scene at the heart of his greatest play.</p>
<p>How did you deal with the theatrical superstitions linked to this
play—not mentioning its title, and all that? Why is this the one
Shakespearean play to have such rituals surrounding it?</p>
<p>Nunn: The Macbeth “bad luck” superstition remains potent among actors
and directors and almost certainly derives initially from the discomfort
that surrounds any dabbling with the black arts. The word “Macbeth” or
any quote from the play must never be uttered in a theater, other than
in the course of doing that play. I love the alternative story, that
this derives from the days when stock companies toured the country led
by actor-managers. If business was really bad, those actor-managers, in
the desperate knowledge that everyone would soon be unemployed, would
have to resort to presenting the biggest crowd-pleaser … Macbeth. So
understandably, “Don’t say that word round here!” My experience in doing
the production of the play with Ian McKellen and Judi Dench was
completely the opposite. Rehearsals were a constant and exciting
delight—often amidst bouts of laughter, we all remained close and caring
friends through The Other Place in Stratford, then the main theater,
then Newcastle, then the Warehouse, then the Young Vic, and then the
television studio. That should have cured me of the superstition once
and for all. But I still feel very distressed if somebody inadvertently
says the “M” word in a theater.</p>
<p>Doran: Very straightforwardly. On the first day of rehearsals I said,
“We are doing a play called Macbeth. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth!” I think
that the whole superstition thing is a total nonsense. There are
delightful stories about the terrible things that have happened doing
Macbeth, but if you have a group of actors together for as long as a
year doing Twelfth Night then terrible things no doubt happen, but we
never call it “The Illyrian Play”! Obviously it’s a play with
sword-fights, actors sometimes get tired and swordfights can go wrong,
so that could be dangerous. I’m fascinated by the history of it but I
think it’s nonsense in terms of the actual production. I felt it was
reductive. So we resolutely on the first day decided to banish those
superstitions and just refer to it as Macbeth. It must have worked
because we were very lucky in having a very successful production!</p>
<p>Goold: They say more about the theatrical community than the play, I
fear. It is a difficult play, though; perhaps only Romeo and Juliet is
harder, because, just as with Romeo and Juliet the play will not happen
if you do not believe in the love of the lovers, Macbeth has to be
scary, and if it doesn’t chill you then it will never take flight.
Perhaps the difficulty of getting terror right onstage has made it so
cursed. All I can say is that we stared it hard in the eyes and it was
the most fortunate career-changing moment of my and my family’s life. We
certainly got lucky with it, but even then I remember landing on the
plane back from the Tony Awards a year after our journey had begun and
feeling the most intense relief that we had touched ground safely—I kept
thinking the play might bite back one day!</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE’S CAREER</p>
<p>IN THE THEATER</p>
<p>BEGINNINGS</p>
<p>William Shakespeare was an extraordinarily intelligent man who was
born and died in an ordinary market town in the English Midlands. He
lived an uneventful life in an eventful age. Born in April 1564, he was
the eldest son of John Shakespeare, a glove-maker who was prominent on
the town council until he fell into financial difficulties. Young
William was educated at the local grammar in Stratford-upon-Avon,
Warwickshire, where he gained a thorough grounding in the Latin
language, the art of rhetoric, and classical poetry. He married Ann
Hathaway and had three children (Susanna, then the twins Hamnet and
Judith) before his twenty-first birthday: an exceptionally young age for
the period. We do not know how he supported his family in the
mid-1580s.</p>
<p>Like many clever country boys, he moved to the city in order to make
his way in the world. Like many creative people, he found a career in
the entertainment business. Public playhouses and professional full-time
acting companies reliant on the market for their income were born in
Shakespeare’s childhood. When he arrived in London as a man, sometime in
the late 1580s, a new phenomenon was in the making: the actor who is so
successful that he becomes a “star.” The word did not exist in its
modern sense, but the pattern is recognizable: audiences went to the
theater not so much to see a particular show as to witness the comedian
Richard Tarlton or the dramatic actor Edward Alleyn.</p>
<p>Shakespeare was an actor before he was a writer. It appears not to
have been long before he realized that he was never going to grow into a
great comedian like Tarlton or a great tragedian like Alleyn. Instead,
he found a role within his company as the man who patched up old plays,
breathing new life, new dramatic twists, into tired repertory pieces. He
paid close attention to the work of the university-educated dramatists
who were writing history plays and tragedies for the public stage in a
style more ambitious, sweeping, and poetically grand than anything that
had been seen before. But he may also have noted that what his friend
and rival Ben Jonson would call “Marlowe’s mighty line” sometimes
faltered in the mode of comedy. Going to university, as Christopher
Marlowe did, was all well and good for honing the arts of rhetorical
elaboration and classical allusion, but it could lead to a loss of the
common touch. To stay close to a large segment of the potential audience
for public theater, it was necessary to write for clowns as well as
kings and to intersperse the flights of poetry with the humor of the
tavern, the privy, and the brothel: Shakespeare was the first to
establish himself early in his career as an equal master of tragedy,
comedy, and history. He realized that theater could be the medium to
make the national past available to a wider audience than the elite who
could afford to read large history books: his signature early works
include not only the classical tragedy Titus Andronicus but also the
sequence of English historical plays on the Wars of the Roses.</p>
<p>He also invented a new role for himself, that of in-house company
dramatist. Where his peers and predecessors had to sell their plays to
the theater managers on a poorly paid piecework basis, Shakespeare took
a percentage of the box-office income. The Lord Chamberlain’s Men
constituted themselves in 1594 as a joint stock company, with the
profits being distributed among the core actors who had invested as
sharers. Shakespeare acted himself—he appears in the cast lists of some
of Ben Jonson’s plays as well as the list of actors’ names at the
beginning of his own collected works—but his principal duty was to write
two or three plays a year for the company. By holding shares, he was
effectively earning himself a royalty on his work, something no author
had ever done before in England. When the Lord Chamberlain’s Men
collected their fee for performance at court in the Christmas season of
1594, three of them went along to the Treasurer of the Chamber: not just
Richard Burbage the tragedian and Will Kempe the clown, but also
Shakespeare the scriptwriter. That was something new.</p>
<p>The next four years were the golden period in Shakespeare’s career,
though overshadowed by the death of his only son, Hamnet, aged eleven,
in 1596. In his early thirties and in full command of both his poetic
and his theatrical medium, he perfected his art of comedy, while also
developing his tragic and historical writing in new ways. In 1598,
Francis Meres, a Cambridge University graduate with his finger on the
pulse of the London literary world, praised Shakespeare for his
excellence across the genres:</p>
<p>As Plautus and Seneca are accounted the best for comedy and tragedy
among the Latins, so Shakespeare among the English is the most excellent
in both kinds for the stage; for comedy, witness his Gentlemen of
Verona, his Errors, his Love Labours Lost, his Love Labours Won, his
Midsummer Night Dream and his Merchant of Venice: for tragedy his
Richard the 2, Richard the 3, Henry the 4, King John, Titus Andronicus
and his Romeo and Juliet.</p>
<p>For Meres, as for the many writers who praised the “honey-flowing
vein” of Venus and Adonis and Lucrece, narrative poems written when the
theaters were closed due to plague in 1593–94, Shakespeare was marked
above all by his linguistic skill, by the gift of turning elegant poetic
phrases.</p>
<p>PLAYHOUSES</p>
<p>Elizabethan playhouses were “thrust” or “one-room” theaters. To
understand Shakespeare’s original theatrical life, we have to forget
about the indoor theater of later times, with its proscenium arch and
curtain that would be opened at the beginning and closed at the end of
each act. In the proscenium arch theater, stage and auditorium are
effectively two separate rooms: the audience looks from one world into
another as if through the imaginary “fourth wall” framed by the
proscenium. The picture-frame stage, together with the elaborate scenic
effects and backdrops beyond it, created the illusion of a
self-contained world—especially once nineteenth-century developments in
the control of artificial lighting meant that the auditorium could be
darkened and the spectators made to focus on the lighted stage.
Shakespeare, by contrast, wrote for a bare platform stage with a
standing audience gathered around it in a courtyard in full daylight.
The audience were always conscious of themselves and their fellow
spectators, and they shared the same “room” as the actors. A sense of
immediate presence and the creation of rapport with the audience were
all-important. The actor could not afford to imagine he was in a closed
world, with silent witnesses dutifully observing him from the
darkness.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s theatrical career began at the Rose Theatre in
Southwark. The stage was wide and shallow, trapezoid in shape, like a
lozenge. This design had a great deal of potential for the theatrical
equivalent of cinematic split-screen effects, whereby one group of
characters would enter at the door at one end of the tiring-house wall
at the back of the stage and another group through the door at the other
end, thus creating two rival tableaux. Many of the battle-heavy and
faction-filled plays that premiered at the Rose have scenes of just this
sort.</p>
<p>At the rear of the Rose stage, there were three capacious exits, each
over ten feet wide. Unfortunately, the very limited excavation of a
fragmentary portion of the original Globe site, also in 1989, revealed
nothing about the stage. The first Globe was built in 1599 with similar
proportions to those of another theater, the Fortune, albeit that the
former was polygonal and looked circular, whereas the latter was
rectangular. The building contract for the Fortune survives and allows
us to infer that the stage of the Globe was probably substantially wider
than it was deep (perhaps forty-three feet wide and twenty-seven feet
deep). It may well have been tapered at the front, like that of the
Rose.</p>
<p>The capacity of the Globe was said to have been enormous, perhaps in
excess of three thousand. It has been conjectured that about eight
hundred people may have stood in the yard, with two thousand or more in
the three layers of covered galleries. The other “public” playhouses
were also of large capacity, whereas the indoor Blackfriars theater that
Shakespeare’s company began using in 1608—the former refectory of a
monastery—had overall internal dimensions of a mere forty-six by sixty
feet. It would have made for a much more intimate theatrical experience
and had a much smaller capacity, probably of about six hundred people.
Since they paid at least sixpence a head, the Blackfriars attracted a
more select or “private” audience. The atmosphere would have been closer
to that of an indoor performance before the court in the Whitehall
Palace or at Richmond. That Shakespeare always wrote for indoor
production at court as well as outdoor performance in the public theater
should make us cautious about inferring, as some scholars have, that the
opportunity provided by the intimacy of the Blackfriars led to a
significant change toward a “chamber” style in his last plays—which,
besides, were performed at both the Globe and the Blackfriars. After the
occupation of the Blackfriars, a five-act structure seems to have become
more important to Shakespeare. That was because of artificial lighting:
there were musical interludes between the acts, while the candles were
trimmed and replaced. Again, though, something similar must have been
necessary for indoor court performances throughout his career.</p>
<p>Front of house there were the “gatherers” who collected the money
from audience members: a penny to stand in the open-air yard, another
penny for a place in the covered galleries, sixpence for the prominent
“lord’s rooms” to the side of the stage. In the indoor “private”
theaters, gallants from the audience who fancied making themselves part
of the spectacle sat on stools on the edge of the stage itself. Scholars
debate as to how widespread this practice was in the public theaters
such as the Globe. Once the audience were in place and the money
counted, the gatherers were available to be extras onstage. That is one
reason why battles and crowd scenes often come later rather than early
in Shakespeare’s plays. There was no formal prohibition upon performance
by women, and there certainly were women among the gatherers, so it is
not beyond the bounds of possibility that female crowd members were
played by females.</p>
<p>The play began at two o’clock in the afternoon and the theater had to
be cleared by five. After the main show, there would be a jig—which
consisted not only of dancing, but also of knockabout comedy (it is the
origin of the farcical “afterpiece” in the eighteenth-century theater).
So the time available for a Shakespeare play was about two and a half
hours, somewhere between the “two hours’ traffic” mentioned in the
prologue to Romeo and Juliet and the “three hours’ spectacle” referred
to in the preface to the 1647 Folio of Beaumont and Fletcher’s plays.
The prologue to a play by Thomas Middleton refers to a thousand lines as
“one hour’s words,” so the likelihood is that about two and a half
thousand, or a maximum of three thousand lines made up the performed
text. This is indeed the length of most of Shakespeare’s comedies,
whereas many of his tragedies and histories are much longer, raising the
possibility that he wrote full scripts, possibly with eventual
publication in mind, in the full knowledge that the stage version would
be heavily cut. The short Quarto texts published in his lifetime—they
used to be called “Bad” Quartos—provide fascinating evidence as to the
kind of cutting that probably took place. So, for instance, the First
Quarto of Hamlet neatly merges two occasions when Hamlet is overheard,
the “Fishmonger” and the “nunnery” scenes.</p>
<p>The social composition of the audience was mixed. The poet Sir John
Davies wrote of “A thousand townsmen, gentlemen and whores, / Porters
and servingmen” who would “together throng” at the public playhouses.
Though moralists associated female play-going with adultery and the sex
trade, many perfectly respectable citizens’ wives were regular
attendees. Some, no doubt, resembled the modern groupie: a story
attested in two different sources has one citizen’s wife making a
post-show assignation with Richard Burbage and ending up in bed with
Shakespeare—supposedly eliciting from the latter the quip that William
the Conqueror was before Richard III. Defenders of theater liked to say
that by witnessing the comeuppance of villains on the stage, audience
members would repent of their own wrongdoings, but the reality is that
most people went to the theater then, as they do now, for entertainment
more than moral edification. Besides, it would be foolish to suppose
that audiences behaved in a homogeneous way: a pamphlet of the 1630s
tells of how two men went to see Pericles and one of them laughed while
the other wept. Bishop John Hall complained that people went to church
for the same reasons that they went to the theater: “for company, for
custom, for recreation … to feed his eyes or his ears … or perhaps for
sleep.”</p>
<p>Men-about-town and clever young lawyers went to be seen as much as to
see. In the modern popular imagination, shaped not least by Shakespeare
in Love and the opening sequence of Laurence Olivier’s Henry V film, the
penny-paying groundlings stand in the yard hurling abuse or
encouragement and hazelnuts or orange peel at the actors, while the
sophisticates in the covered galleries appreciate Shakespeare’s soaring
poetry. The reality was probably the other way around. A “groundling”
was a kind of fish, so the nickname suggests the penny audience standing
below the level of the stage and gazing in silent open-mouthed wonder at
the spectacle unfolding above them. The more difficult audience members,
who kept up a running commentary of clever remarks on the performance
and who occasionally got into quarrels with players, were the gallants.
Like Hollywood movies in modern times, Elizabethan and Jacobean plays
exercised a powerful influence on the fashion and behavior of the young.
John Marston mocks the lawyers who would open their lips, perhaps to
court a girl, and out would “flow / Naught but pure Juliet and
Romeo.”</p>
<p>THE ENSEMBLE AT WORK</p>
<p>In the absence of typewriters and photocopying machines, reading
aloud would have been the means by which the company got to know a new
play. The tradition of the playwright reading his complete script to the
assembled company endured for generations. A copy would then have been
taken to the Master of the Revels for licensing. The theater book-holder
or prompter would then have copied the parts for distribution to the
actors. A partbook consisted of the character’s lines, with each speech
preceded by the last three or four words of the speech before, the
so-called “cue.” These would have been taken away and studied or
“conned.” During this period of learning the parts, an actor might have
had some one-to-one instruction, perhaps from the dramatist, perhaps
from a senior actor who had played the same part before, and, in the
case of an apprentice, from his master. A high percentage of Desdemona’s
lines occur in dialogue with Othello, of Lady Macbeth’s with Macbeth,
Cleopatra’s with Antony, and Volumnia’s with Coriolanus. The roles would
almost certainly have been taken by the apprentice of the lead actor,
usually Burbage, who delivers the majority of the cues. Given that
apprentices lodged with their masters, there would have been ample
opportunity for personal instruction, which may be what made it possible
for young men to play such demanding parts.</p>
<p>After the parts were learned, there may have been no more than a
single rehearsal before the first performance. With six different plays
to be put on every week, there was no time for more. Actors, then, would
go into a show with a very limited sense of the whole. The notion of a
collective rehearsal process that is itself a process of discovery for
the actors is wholly modern and would have been incomprehensible to
Shakespeare and his original ensemble. Given the number of parts an
actor had to hold in his memory, the forgetting of lines was probably
more frequent than in the modern theater. The book-holder was on hand to
prompt.</p>
<p>Backstage personnel included the property man, the tire-man who
oversaw the costumes, call boys, attendants, and the musicians, who
might play at various times from the main stage, the rooms above and
within the tiring-house. Scriptwriters sometimes made a nuisance of
themselves backstage. There was often tension between the acting
companies and the freelance playwrights from whom they purchased
scripts: it was a smart move on the part of Shakespeare and the Lord
Chamberlain’s Men to bring the writing process in-house.</p>
<p>Scenery was limited, though sometimes set pieces were brought on (a
bank of flowers, a bed, the mouth of hell). The trapdoor from below, the
gallery stage above, and the curtained discovery-space at the back
allowed for an array of special effects: the rising of ghosts and
apparitions, the descent of gods, dialogue between a character at a
window and another at ground level, the revelation of a statue or a pair
of lovers playing at chess. Ingenious use could be made of props, as
with the ass’s head in A Midsummer Night’s Dream. In a theater that does
not clutter the stage with the material paraphernalia of everyday life,
those objects that are deployed may take on powerful symbolic weight, as
when Shylock bears his weighing scales in one hand and knife in the
other, thus becoming a parody of the figure of Justice who traditionally
bears a sword and a balance. Among the more significant items in the
property cupboard of Shakespeare’s company, there would have been a
throne (the “chair of state”), joint stools, books, bottles, coins,
purses, letters (which are brought onstage, read or referred to on about
eighty occasions in the complete works), maps, gloves, a set of stocks
(in which Kent is put in King Lear), rings, rapiers, daggers,
broadswords, staves, pistols, masks and vizards, heads and skulls,
torches and tapers and lanterns, which served to signal night scenes on
the daylit stage, a buck’s head, an ass’s head, animal costumes. Live
animals also put in appearances, most notably the dog Crab in The Two
Gentlemen of Verona and possibly a young polar bear in The Winter’s
Tale.</p>

<li>Hypothetical reconstruction of the interior of an Elizabethan
playhouse during a performance.</li>
</ol>
<p>The costumes were the most important visual dimension of the play.
Playwrights were paid between £2 and £6 per script, whereas Alleyn was
not averse to paying £20 for “a black velvet cloak with sleeves
embroidered all with silver and gold.” No matter the period of the play,
actors always wore contemporary costume. The excitement for the audience
came not from any impression of historical accuracy, but from the
richness of the attire and perhaps the transgressive thrill of the
knowledge that here were commoners like themselves strutting in the
costumes of courtiers in effective defiance of the strict sumptuary laws
whereby in real life people had to wear the clothes that befitted their
social station.</p>
<p>To an even greater degree than props, costumes could carry symbolic
importance. Racial characteristics could be suggested: a breastplate and
helmet for a Roman soldier, a turban for a Turk, long robes for exotic
characters such as Moors, a gabardine for a Jew. The figure of Time, as
in The Winter’s Tale, would be equipped with hourglass, scythe, and
wings; Rumour, who speaks the prologue of 2 Henry IV, wore a costume
adorned with a thousand tongues. The wardrobe in the tiring-house of the
Globe would have contained much of the same stock as that of rival
manager Philip Henslowe at the Rose: green gowns for outlaws and
foresters, black for melancholy men such as Jaques and people in
mourning such as the Countess in All’s Well That Ends Well (at the
beginning of Hamlet, the prince is still in mourning black when everyone
else is in festive garb for the wedding of the new king), a gown and
hood for a friar (or a feigned friar like the duke in Measure for
Measure), blue coats and tawny to distinguish the followers of rival
factions, a leather apron and ruler for a carpenter (as in the opening
scene of Julius Caesar—and in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, where this is
the only sign that Peter Quince is a carpenter), a cockle hat with staff
and a pair of sandals for a pilgrim or palmer (the disguise assumed by
Helen in All’s Well), bodices and kirtles with farthingales beneath for
the boys who are to be dressed as girls. A gender switch such as that of
Rosalind or Jessica seems to have taken between fifty and eighty lines
of dialogue—Viola does not resume her “maiden weeds,” but remains in her
boy’s costume to the end of Twelfth Night because a change would have
slowed down the action at just the moment it was speeding to a climax.
Henslowe’s inventory also included “a robe for to go invisible”: Oberon,
Puck, and Ariel must have had something similar.</p>
<p>As the costumes appealed to the eyes, so there was music for the
ears. Comedies included many songs. Desdemona’s willow song, perhaps a
late addition to the text, is a rare and thus exceptionally poignant
example from tragedy. Trumpets and tuckets sounded for ceremonial
entrances, drums denoted an army on the march. Background music could
create atmosphere, as at the beginning of Twelfth Night, during the
lovers’ dialogue near the end of The Merchant of Venice, when the statue
seemingly comes to life in The Winter’s Tale, and for the revival of
Pericles and of Lear (in the Quarto text, but not the Folio). The
haunting sound of the hautboy suggested a realm beyond the human, as
when the god Hercules is imagined deserting Mark Antony. Dances
symbolized the harmony of the end of a comedy—though in Shakespeare’s
world of mingled joy and sorrow, someone is usually left out of the
circle.</p>
<p>The most important resource was, of course, the actors themselves.
They needed many skills: in the words of one contemporary commentator,
“dancing, activity, music, song, elocution, ability of body, memory,
skill of weapon, pregnancy of wit.” Their bodies were as significant as
their voices. Hamlet tells the player to “suit the action to the word,
the word to the action”: moments of strong emotion, known as “passions,”
relied on a repertoire of dramatic gestures as well as a modulation of
the voice. When Titus Andronicus has had his hand chopped off, he asks
“How can I grace my talk, / Wanting a hand to give it action?” A pen
portrait of “The Character of an Excellent Actor” by the dramatist John
Webster is almost certainly based on his impression of Shakespeare’s
leading man, Richard Burbage: “By a full and significant action of body,
he charms our attention: sit in a full theater, and you will think you
see so many lines drawn from the circumference of so many ears, whiles
the actor is the centre.…”</p>
<p>Though Burbage was admired above all others, praise was also heaped
upon the apprentice players whose alto voices fitted them for the parts
of women. A spectator at Oxford in 1610 records how the audience were
reduced to tears by the pathos of Desdemona’s death. The puritans who
fumed about the biblical prohibition upon cross-dressing and the
encouragement to sodomy constituted by the sight of an adult male
kissing a teenage boy onstage were a small minority. Little is known,
however, about the characteristics of the leading apprentices in
Shakespeare’s company. It may perhaps be inferred that one was a lot
taller than the other, since Shakespeare often wrote for a pair of
female friends, one tall and fair, the other short and dark (Helena and
Hermia, Rosalind and Celia, Beatrice and Hero).</p>
<p>We know little about Shakespeare’s own acting roles—an early allusion
indicates that he often took royal parts, and a venerable tradition
gives him old Adam in As You Like It and the ghost of old King Hamlet.
Save for Burbage’s lead roles and the generic part of the clown, all
such castings are mere speculation. We do not even know for sure whether
the original Falstaff was Will Kempe or another actor who specialized in
comic roles, Thomas Pope.</p>
<p>Kempe left the company in early 1599. Tradition has it that he fell
out with Shakespeare over the matter of excessive improvisation. He was
replaced by Robert Armin, who was less of a clown and more of a cerebral
wit: this explains the difference between such parts as Lancelet Gobbo
and Dogberry, which were written for Kempe, and the more verbally
sophisticated Feste and Lear’s Fool, which were written for Armin.</p>
<p>One thing that is clear from surviving “plots” or storyboards of
plays from the period is that a degree of doubling was necessary. 2
Henry VI has over sixty speaking parts, but more than half of the
characters only appear in a single scene and most scenes have only six
to eight speakers. At a stretch, the play could be performed by thirteen
actors. When Thomas Platter saw Julius Caesar at the Globe in 1599, he
noted that there were about fifteen. Why doesn’t Paris go to the Capulet
ball in Romeo and Juliet? Perhaps because he was doubled with Mercutio,
who does. In The Winter’s Tale, Mamillius might have come back as
Perdita and Antigonus been doubled by Camillo, making the partnership
with Paulina at the end a very neat touch. Titania and Oberon are often
played by the same pair as Hippolyta and Theseus, suggesting a symbolic
matching of the rulers of the worlds of night and day, but it is
questionable whether there would have been time for the necessary
costume changes. As so often, one is left in a realm of tantalizing
speculation.</p>
<p>THE KING’S MAN</p>
<p>The new king, James I, who had held the Scottish throne as James VI
since he had been an infant, immediately took the Lord Chamberlain’s Men
under his direct patronage. Henceforth they would be the King’s Men, and
for the rest of Shakespeare’s career they were favored with far more
court performances than any of their rivals. There even seem to have
been rumors early in the reign that Shakespeare and Burbage were being
considered for knighthoods, an unprecedented honor for mere actors—and
one that in the event was not accorded to a member of the profession for
nearly three hundred years, when the title was bestowed upon Henry
Irving, the leading Shakespearean actor of Queen Victoria’s reign.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s productivity rate slowed in the Jacobean years, not
because of age or some personal trauma, but because there were frequent
outbreaks of plague, causing the theaters to be closed for long periods.
The King’s Men were forced to spend many months on the road. Between
November 1603 and 1608, they were to be found at various towns in the
south and Midlands, though Shakespeare probably did not tour with them
by this time. He had bought a large house back home in Stratford and was
accumulating other property. He may indeed have stopped acting soon
after the new king took the throne. With the London theaters closed so
much of the time and a large repertoire on the stocks, Shakespeare seems
to have focused his energies on writing a few long and complex tragedies
that could have been played on demand at court: Othello, King Lear,
Antony and Cleopatra, Coriolanus, and Cymbeline are among his longest
and poetically grandest plays. Macbeth only survives in a shorter text,
which shows signs of adaptation after Shakespeare’s death. The bitterly
satirical Timon of Athens, apparently a collaboration with Thomas
Middleton that may have failed on the stage, also belongs to this
period. In comedy, too, he wrote longer and morally darker works than in
the Elizabethan period, pushing at the very bounds of the form in
Measure for Measure and All’s Well That Ends Well.</p>
<p>From 1608 onward, when the King’s Men began occupying the indoor
Blackfriars playhouse (as a winter house, meaning that they only used
the outdoor Globe in summer?), Shakespeare turned to a more romantic
style. His company had a great success with a revived and altered
version of an old pastoral play called Mucedorus. It even featured a
bear. The younger dramatist John Fletcher, meanwhile, sometimes working
in collaboration with Francis Beaumont, was pioneering a new style of
tragicomedy, a mix of romance and royalism laced with intrigue and
pastoral excursions. Shakespeare experimented with this idiom in
Cymbeline and it was presumably with his blessing that Fletcher
eventually took over as the King’s Men’s company dramatist. The two
writers apparently collaborated on three plays in the years 1612–14: a
lost romance called Cardenio (based on the love-madness of a character
in Cervantes’ Don Quixote), Henry VIII (originally staged with the title
“All Is True”), and The Two Noble Kinsmen, a dramatization of Chaucer’s
“Knight’s Tale.” These were written after Shakespeare’s two final
solo-authored plays, The Winter’s Tale, a self-consciously old-fashioned
work dramatizing the pastoral romance of his old enemy Robert Greene,
and The Tempest, which at one and the same time drew together multiple
theatrical traditions, diverse reading, and contemporary interest in the
fate of a ship that had been wrecked on the way to the New World.</p>
<p>The collaborations with Fletcher suggest that Shakespeare’s career
ended with a slow fade rather than the sudden retirement supposed by the
nineteenth-century Romantic critics who read Prospero’s epilogue to The
Tempest as Shakespeare’s personal farewell to his art. In the last few
years of his life Shakespeare certainly spent more of his time in
Stratford-upon-Avon, where he became further involved in property
dealing and litigation. But his London life also continued. In 1613 he
made his first major London property purchase: a freehold house in the
Blackfriars district, close to his company’s indoor theater. The Two
Noble Kinsmen may have been written as late as 1614, and Shakespeare was
in London on business a little over a year before he died of an unknown
cause at home in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1616, probably on his
fifty-second birthday.</p>
<p>About half the sum of his works were published in his lifetime, in
texts of variable quality. A few years after his death, his fellow
actors began putting together an authorized edition of his complete
Comedies, Histories and Tragedies. It appeared in 1623, in large “Folio”
format. This collection of thirty-six plays gave Shakespeare his
immortality. In the words of his fellow dramatist Ben Jonson, who
contributed two poems of praise at the start of the Folio, the body of
his work made him “a monument without a tomb”:</p>
<p>And art alive still while thy book doth live</p>
<p>And we have wits to read and praise to give …</p>

<p>AVAILABLE ON DVD</p>
<p>Kumonosu jô, variously known in English as Throne of Blood and The
Castle of the Spider’s Web (1957, DVD 2001), directed by Akira Kurosawa.
Superlative translation to Samurai Japan.</p>
<p>Macbeth, directed by Roman Polanski (1971, DVD 2002). With Jon Finch
and Francesca Annis. Bloody and controversial, but has stood the test of
time well.</p>
<p>Macbeth, directed by Trevor Nunn (1978, DVD 2004). Film of Nunn’s RSC
production with Ian McKellen and Judi Dench: though unable to reproduce
the intensity of live theater, especially in a case such as this, it
does give continuing life to a masterly production.</p>
<p>Macbeth, directed by Jack Gold (1983, DVD 2004). Low-key production
in the BBC television Complete Shakespeare series, but with a thoughtful
performance from Nicol Williamson as Macbeth and Jane Lapotaire strong
as Lady Macbeth.</p>
<p>Macbeth, directed by Gregory Doran (Channel 4 television 2001, DVD
2003). Film of Doran’s RSC production with Antony Sher and Harriet
Walter: though unable to reproduce the intensity of live theater,
especially in a case such as this, it does give continuing life to an
immensely powerful production.</p>
<p>Orson Welles’ Macbeth, directed by Orson Welles (1948, DVD 2003).
Facinating version by one of cinema’s greats.</p>
<p>Shakespeare Retold: Macbeth (BBC television and DVD, 2005), directed
by Mark Brozel. Ingenious updating to the kitchen of a celebrity chef,
with excellent performances by James McAvoy and Keeley Hawes. Plot and
themes, but not language, of the original.</p>
<p>Verdi’s Macbeth, conducted by James Levine (DVD 2008). New York
Metropolitan Opera production.</p>
