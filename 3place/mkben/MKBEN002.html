<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>WHAT IS TRAGEDY?</p>
<p>Macbeth is Shakespeare’s shortest, quickest tragedy. Its colors are
black and red. It summons up dusk and midnight and at last a poor player
who struts and frets with empty sound and fury, his life a snuffed out
candle. But along the way we witness high passion, vaulting ambition,
alliances made and broken. Macbeth himself is great in action but not in
judgment. Give him a task on the battlefield and he will carry it
through with aplomb. But give him words and he will be first easily led,
then hesitant. His wife chides him for this but, ironically, as the two
of them wade deeper into blood, he becomes more purposeful, she a
nightmare-beset shadow of her former self.</p>
<p>Every day you will find some local “tragedy” described in the pages
of your newspaper: a child drowns, a car crashes, a woman is murdered.
The word is used so frequently, and sometimes with regard to misfortunes
that in the overall scale of things are so commonplace, that it has been
emptied of its primal force. If the word had been treated with the
respect it deserves, kept ready for the truly awesome and the
world-historical horrors, then a phrase such as “the tragic events of
September 11” might have had genuine force instead of being a mere
formula that rolls off every politician’s tongue.</p>
<p>“Is this the promised end?” asks the Duke of Albany at the end of
Shakespeare’s King Lear. “Or image of that horror?” replies the Earl of
Kent. Every human death is, for those who witness it, an image of our
own promised end, but until relatively recently the word “tragedy” had
not been applied to the mundane cycle of death, the expirations and
silencings that occur every hour, every minute, every second. In
Shakespeare’s world the term was reserved for two exceptional kinds of
disaster. One was the catastrophe that seemed cosmic in its scale and
horrific in its particulars, so genuinely seeming to be an image of the
apocalypse, the promised end of all things. When William Caxton,
England’s first printer, wrote of “tragicall tidings,” the sort of thing
he had in mind was the fall of ancient Troy—the end of a whole
civilization, a turning point in history.</p>
<p>The second traditional sense of the word tragedy was shaped less by
scale than by structure. “Tragedie,” wrote Geoffrey Chaucer, father of
English verse, “is to seyn a certeyn storie, / As olde bookes maken us
memorie, / Of hym that stood in greet prosperitee, / And is yfallen out
of heigh degree / Into myserie, and endeth wrecchedly.” The higher they
climb, the harder they fall: tragedy is traditionally about heroes and
kings, larger-than-life figures who climb to the top of fortune’s wheel
and are then toppled off. It is a structure saturated with irony: the
very quality that is the source of a character’s greatness is also the
cause of his downfall.</p>
<p>This is why talk of a “tragic flaw” is misleading. The theory of the
flaw arises from a misunderstanding of Aristotle’s influential account
of ancient Greek tragedy. For Aristotle, hamartia, the thing that
precipitates tragedy, is not a psychological predisposition but an
event—not a character trait but a fatal action. In several famous cases
in Greek tragedy, the particular mistake is to kill a blood relative in
ignorance of their identity. So too in Shakespeare, it is action (or, in
Hamlet’s case, inaction) that determines character, and not vice
versa.</p>
<p>In Shakespearean tragedy, the time is out of joint and the lead
character is out of his accustomed role. Hamlet the scholar is happy to
be presented with an intellectual puzzle, but unsure how to proceed when
presented with a demand to kill. Macbeth the soldier, by contrast,
relishes violent action but is restless when it comes to waiting for his
reward. Hamlet meditates on the nature of providence, while Macbeth is
prompted to take his fate into his own hands. Imagine Macbeth in
Hamlet’s situation. He would have needed no second prompting. On hearing
the Ghost’s story, he would have gone straight down from the battlements
and “unseamed” King Claudius “from the nave to th’chops.” His courage
and his capacity to act are without question.</p>
<p>King Lear cannot let go of the past, Macbeth cannot wait for the
future, Hamlet cannot stop worrying about the future: none of them is
content to live in the moment. This is not so much an individual tragic
flaw as a universal human failing. We are creatures bound by time but
always longing for another time.</p>
<p>Macbeth is more like Hamlet than he appears to be at first glance. He
has a conscience. When his ambition is stirred by the weyard sisters’
prophecies, he tries to slap it down: “Stars, hide your fires: / Let not
light see my black and deep desires.” And when he returns to his castle:
he soliloquizes on the afterlife every bit in the manner of the Danish
prince. But where Hamlet is profoundly alone, unable to bring himself to
confide in Ophelia because Gertrude has destroyed his faith in
womankind, Macbeth has a wife to take charge of him. She enters as he is
concluding his conscience-ridden soliloquy and with a few brisk
exchanges and put-downs (“When you durst do it, then you were a man”)
she changes his mind and settles him to the terrible feat.</p>
<p>His conscience is still working after the regicide, as he is haunted
by the sound of the voice crying “Sleep no more.” His wife, on the other
hand, is cool and practical (“A little water clears us of this deed”).
But as the play progresses, in one of Shakespeare’s finest structural
movements, a reversal takes place. It is Lady Macbeth who sleeps no
more, whose mind is emptied of everything save the night of the murder,
who cannot wash away the blood (“All the perfumes of Arabia will not
sweeten this little hand”). Macbeth, by contrast, steeps himself so far
in blood that it becomes easier to carry on than to turn back. He does
not tell his wife about the plan to murder Banquo and Fleance, and by
the fourth act, when he massacres the innocent Macduffs, she has
temporarily disappeared from the action. By the fifth, he is willing on
the final encounter: “Blow wind, come wrack, / At least we’ll die with
harness on our back.” The final thoughts inspired by his wife are
fatalistic: she began by spurring him to take his destiny into his own
hands, she ends as the provocation to his meditation on the
meaninglessness of life.</p>
<p>Bound by time but always longing for another time: in the face of
this dilemma, Shakespearean tragedy pulls in two different directions.
There is a movement toward acceptance of the moment, which means
acceptance of death. Thus Macbeth: “She should have died hereafter. /
There would have been a time for such a word.” And Hamlet: “If it be
now, ’tis not to come: if it be not to come, it will be now: if it be
not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all.” And Edgar in King
Lear: “Men must endure / Their going hence, even as their coming hither:
/ Ripeness is all.” This is a kind of tragic knowledge that derives from
the classical philosophy of Stoicism. Stoicism meant resignation,
fortitude, suppression of emotion.</p>
<p>But Shakespeare was also skeptical about Stoicism. It is the Stoic
philosophy that he mocks when a grieving father refuses comfort in Much
Ado About Nothing: “I will be flesh and blood,” says Leonato, “For there
was never yet philosopher / That could endure the toothache patiently, /
However they have writ the style of gods / And made a pish at chance and
sufferance.” The trouble with Stoicism is that it neglects the capacity
to feel, something which makes us human just as much as the capacity to
reason. The counter-movement in Shakespearean tragedy is toward an
acknowledgment of the emotions, as they express themselves in the body.
Gloucester in King Lear has no eyes and yet he sees how the world goes:
he sees it feelingly. Before Macduff can act like a man in taking
revenge against Macbeth for the murder of his family he must first feel
his grief as a man—he must let himself be a weeping human before turning
himself into an alpha male.</p>
<p>“A play read,” mused Dr. Samuel Johnson in his preface to
Shakespeare, “affects the mind like a play acted.” It doesn’t: what you
have with a play acted is the actor’s body. Shakespeare was not a Stoic
because he was a player. A player works with his body as much as with
his words. In the theater, the body is a supremely expressive instrument
of feeling.</p>
<p>“Words, words, mere words,” says Hamlet-like Troilus in Shakespeare’s
acrid Trojan tragedy Troilus and Cressida, “No matter from the heart.”
In the end, what matters about Shakespearean tragedy are not the fine
words of resignation and Stoic comfort, but the raw matter of the heart
and the solid presence of the body. The body in pain. The body emptied
of life but still available for a farewell kiss or blessing. The bodies
of Romeo and Juliet, of Othello and Desdemona, come to rest in an
embrace. Horatio, best of friends, is there to bid Hamlet’s body
goodnight. Lear is allowed to mourn over Cordelia; when he has said
goodbye to his daughter he is ready for his own heart to break. Macbeth
is the loneliest of the tragedies because the Macbeths, having begun the
play as one of the few happily married couples anywhere in Shakespeare,
drift apart and each dies profoundly alone. There is no Horatio or Earl
of Kent to “Give sorrow words” on behalf of the audience. Only in this
play could Shakespeare have described life as a walking shadow, a poor
player, a tale “Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, / Signifying
nothing.”</p>
