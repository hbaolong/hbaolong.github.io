<h4 id="act-3-scene-1">Act 3 Scene 1</h4>
<p>running scene 10</p>
<p>Enter Banquo</p>
<p>BANQUO Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all</p>
<p>As the weyard women promised, and I fear</p>
<p>Thou played’st most foully3 for’t. Yet it was said</p>
<p>It should not stand in thy posterity4,</p>
<p>But that myself should be the root and father</p>
<p>Of many kings. If there come truth from them —</p>
<p>As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine7 —</p>
<p>Why, by the verities on thee made good8,</p>
<p>May they not be my oracles as well,</p>
<p>And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.</p>
<p>Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady [Macbeth as Queen],</p>
<p>Lennox, Ross, Lords and Attendants</p>
<p>MACBETH Here’s our chief guest.</p>
<p>LADY MACBETH If he had been forgotten,</p>
<p>It had been as a gap in our great feast</p>
<p>And all-thing unbecoming.14</p>
<p>To Banquo</p>
<p>MACBETH Tonight we hold a solemn15 supper, sir,</p>
<p>And I’ll request your presence.</p>
<p>BANQUO Let your highness</p>
<p>Command upon18 me, to the which my duties</p>
<p>Are with a most indissoluble tie</p>
<p>Forever knit.20</p>
<p>MACBETH Ride you this afternoon?</p>
<p>BANQUO Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>MACBETH We should have else23 desired your good advice —</p>
<p>Which still hath been both grave and prosperous24 —</p>
<p>In this day’s council25: but we’ll take tomorrow.</p>
<p>Is’t far you ride?</p>
<p>BANQUO As far, my lord, as will fill up the time</p>
<p>’Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better28,</p>
<p>I must become a borrower of the night</p>
<p>For a dark hour or twain.30</p>
<p>MACBETH Fail not our feast.</p>
<p>BANQUO My lord, I will not.</p>
<p>MACBETH We hear our bloody cousins are bestowed33</p>
<p>In England and in Ireland, not confessing</p>
<p>Their cruel parricide35, filling their hearers</p>
<p>With strange invention36: but of that tomorrow,</p>
<p>When therewithal we shall have cause of state37</p>
<p>Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse. Adieu,</p>
<p>Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?</p>
<p>BANQUO Ay, my good lord. Our time does call upon’s.</p>
<p>MACBETH I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,</p>
<p>And so I do commend42 you to their backs. Farewell.</p>
<p>Exit Banquo</p>
<p>Let every man be master of his time</p>
<p>Till seven at night. To make society44</p>
<p>The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself</p>
<p>Till supper-time alone: while46 then, God be with you!</p>
<p>Exeunt Lords. [Macbeth and a Servant remain]</p>
<p>Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men47</p>
<p>Our pleasure?</p>
<p>SERVANT They are, my lord, without49 the palace gate.</p>
<p>MACBETH Bring them before us.</p>
<p>Exit Servant</p>
<p>To be thus51 is nothing, but to be safely thus:</p>
<p>Our fears in Banquo stick52 deep,</p>
<p>And in his royalty of nature reigns that</p>
<p>Which would be feared. ’Tis much he dares,</p>
<p>And to that dauntless temper55 of his mind,</p>
<p>He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour</p>
<p>To act in safety. There is none but he</p>
<p>Whose being58 I do fear: and under him</p>
<p>My genius is rebuked59, as it is said</p>
<p>Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid60 the sisters</p>
<p>When first they put the name of king upon me,</p>
<p>And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like</p>
<p>They hailed him father to a line of kings:</p>
<p>Upon my head they placed a fruitless64 crown,</p>
<p>And put a barren sceptre65 in my grip,</p>
<p>Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal66 hand,</p>
<p>No son of mine succeeding. If’t be so,</p>
<p>For Banquo’s issue have I filed68 my mind:</p>
<p>For them the gracious69 Duncan have I murdered:</p>
<p>Put rancours in the vessel70 of my peace</p>
<p>Only for them, and mine eternal jewel71</p>
<p>Given to the common enemy of man72</p>
<p>To make them kings: the seeds of Banquo kings.</p>
<p>Rather than so, come fate into the list74,</p>
<p>And champion me to th’utterance!75— Who’s there?</p>
<p>Enter Servant and two Murderers</p>
<p>To Servant</p>
<p>Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.—</p>
<p>Exit Servant</p>
<p>Was it not yesterday we spoke together?</p>
<p>MURDERERS It was, so please your highness.</p>
<p>MACBETH Well then, now have you considered of my79</p>
<p>speeches? Know that it was he in the times past which held80</p>
<p>you so under fortune, which you thought had been our</p>
<p>innocent self: this I made good to you in our last conference82,</p>
<p>passed in probation with you how you were borne in hand83,</p>
<p>how crossed, the instruments, who wrought84 with them, and</p>
<p>all things else that might to half a soul and to a notion85
crazed</p>
<p>say ‘Thus did Banquo.’</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER You made it known to us.</p>
<p>MACBETH I did so, and went further, which is now our point of</p>
<p>second meeting. Do you find your patience so predominant</p>
<p>in your nature that you can let this go? Are you so gospelled90</p>
<p>o pray for this good man and for his issue92, whose heavy</p>
<p>hand hath bowed you to the grave and beggared yours92 for</p>
<p>ever?</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER We are men, my liege.</p>
<p>MACBETH Ay, in the catalogue ye go for95 men,</p>
<p>As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs96,</p>
<p>Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves are clept97</p>
<p>All by the name of dogs: the valued file98</p>
<p>Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle99,</p>
<p>The housekeeper100, the hunter, every one</p>
<p>According to the gift which bounteous101 nature</p>
<p>Hath in him closed102, whereby he does receive</p>
<p>Particular addition from the bill103</p>
<p>That writes them all alike: and so of men.</p>
<p>Now, if you have a station in the file105,</p>
<p>Not i’th’worst rank106 of manhood, say’t,</p>
<p>And I will put that business in your bosoms</p>
<p>Whose execution108 takes your enemy off,</p>
<p>Grapples109 you to the heart and love of us,</p>
<p>Who wear our health but sickly in his life110,</p>
<p>Which in his death were perfect.111</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER I am one, my liege,</p>
<p>Whom the vile blows and buffets113 of the world</p>
<p>Hath so incensed that I am reckless what</p>
<p>I do to spite the world.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER And I another,</p>
<p>So weary with disasters, tugged with117 fortune,</p>
<p>That I would set118 my life on any chance</p>
<p>To mend it or be rid on’t.119</p>
<p>MACBETH Both of you know Banquo was your enemy.</p>
<p>MURDERERS True, my lord.</p>
<p>MACBETH So is he mine, and in such bloody distance122</p>
<p>That every minute of his being thrusts123</p>
<p>Against my near’st of life124: and though I could</p>
<p>With barefaced power sweep him from my sight</p>
<p>And bid my will avouch it126, yet I must not,</p>
<p>For127 certain friends that are both his and mine,</p>
<p>Whose loves I may not drop, but wail128 his fall</p>
<p>Who I myself struck down. And thence it is</p>
<p>That I to your assistance do make love130,</p>
<p>Masking the business from the common eye</p>
<p>For sundry132 weighty reasons.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER We shall, my lord,</p>
<p>Perform what you command us.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Though our lives—135</p>
<p>MACBETH Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most</p>
<p>I will advise137 you where to plant yourselves,</p>
<p>Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’th’time138,</p>
<p>The moment on’t, for’t must be done tonight,</p>
<p>And something from the palace, always thought140</p>
<p>That I require a clearness. And with him —</p>
<p>To leave no rubs nor botches142 in the work —</p>
<p>Fleance his son, that keeps him company,</p>
<p>Whose absence is no less material144 to me</p>
<p>Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate</p>
<p>Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart146:</p>
<p>I’ll come to you anon.</p>
<p>MURDERERS We are resolved, my lord.</p>
<p>MACBETH I’ll call upon you straight: abide149 within.—</p>
<p>[Murderers may exit]</p>
<p>It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight,</p>
<p>If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
