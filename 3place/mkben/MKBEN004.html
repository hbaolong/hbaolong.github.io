<h4 id="the-weyard-sisters">THE WEYARD SISTERS</h4>
<p>A more difficult question is the precise nature of those prophetic
females who open the play. Whether or not there were such things as
witches was a fiercely debated subject in the period. In his treatise Of
Demonology, King James affirmed that there were. He believed that, nine
times out of ten, witches were women, but women with unnaturally
masculine features such as facial hair, that they were in league with
the devil, that they had familiar spirits in the shapes of cats and
toads, that their most dangerous work consisted of conjuring up images
of people and cursing them, that they sent succubi to remove the sexual
lifeblood from men, that they caused disease in animals. One could
establish whether or not a woman was devilishly possessed by a “witch
mark” on her body that would not bleed if it were pricked. When Shylock
in The Merchant of Venice says “If you prick us, do we not bleed?” he
means that Jews are not devilish in the way that witches are. The
Macbeth witches answer to most of these characteristics: they are women
with beards, summoning Grey Malkin the cat and Paddock the toad, while
lines such as “I’ll drain him dry as hay” and “Killing swine” suggest
succubi and diseased livestock.</p>
<p>But should we necessarily think of them as old hags, fairytale
witches? Macbeth’s source, Holinshed’s “Chronicles of Scotland,”
variously calls them “weird sisters,” “fairies,” and “women in strange
and wild apparel, resembling creatures of the elder world.” A woodcut in
Holinshed shows them as rather grumpy but elegantly dressed ladies,
certainly not bearded hags.</p>
<p>A further complication is that the only surviving printed text of
Macbeth (found in the First Folio) seems to represent the play not as it
was written by Shakespeare, but as it was revised for later performance,
probably by the younger dramatist Thomas Middleton. The two songs in
Macbeth (in Act 3 Scene 5 and Act 4 Scene 1) also appear in Middleton’s
play The Witch. The authorship of the songs seems to be the same as that
of the rest of The Witch: certain demonic details are borrowed from
Reginald Scot’s 1584 treatise A Discovery of Witchcraft, an important
source for Middleton’s play but not for Shakespeare’s. It is highly
probable that the whole of Act 3 Scene 5 and the Hecate portions of Act
4 Scene 1 are Middletonian insertions in the Shakespearean script. They
have the self-contained quality of inserted scenes. They are put in to
beef up the witchcraft business and spice the play with a couple of
song-and-dance routines. They were probably written after Ben Jonson’s
Masque of Queens (1609), a short text with chanting hags who are well
worth comparing to the revised Shakespeare/Middleton witches. Indeed,
the final dance in Act 4 Scene 1 may have used the music and
choreography from Jonson’s masque.</p>
<p>The additions represent an excellent example of the practice of
altering a theater script to cash in on a new fashion. But the change
may have been more than local. As long ago as 1818, Samuel Taylor
Coleridge made a very interesting observation in a lecture: he said that
despite living in an age of witchcraft and astrology, Shakespeare
included in his plays no witches. He added the parenthetic note, “for we
must not be deluded by stage-directions”—what he had noticed was that
the sisters are never actually called “witches” by themselves or the
other characters. They are witches in the Folio stage directions but
“weyard sisters” in the text. The only person who refers explicitly to a
witch is the sailor’s wife reported in Act 1 Scene 3. The first weyard
sister is obviously not very pleased with the appellation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“As Macbeth and Banquo journeyed toward Forres … there met them
three women in strange and wild apparel, resembling creatures of the
elder world” (Holinshed’s “Chronicles of Scotland,” 1587).</li>
</ol>
<p>Are the weyard sisters fair or foul? They are more fair than foul in
Holinshed. And in the astrologer Simon Forman’s recollection of the
performance of Macbeth he saw at the Globe Theatre in 1611, they are
described as “fairies or nymphs,” which also sound more fair than foul.
The sense of their foulness derives principally from the Middletonian
witch-scenes. Banquo’s description in Act 1 Scene 3 suggests physical
foulness, but his language is characterized primarily by bafflement as
to the sisters’ appearance. Could they initially have been fair ladies
giving apparently fair but in fact foul prophecies? Whatever their
appearance, it is significant that they foretell rather than control. In
Shakespeare’s original text, the sisters may have been morally ambiguous
creatures who do nothing more than give voice to mysterious and
equivocal “solicitings,” oracular prophecies. Middleton may then have
converted them into the kind of overtly evil singing and chanting
witches who had appeared in Jonson’s Masque of Queens and about which he
wrote his own The Witch. He also doubled their number and brought on
Hecate and assorted attendant spirits, including one in the shape of a
cat. Crude practitioners of black magic, they are unequivocal almost to
the point of comedy. This said, we should not necessarily dismiss
Middleton’s contributions as “spurious interpolations”: they are the
product of the play’s evolving life in the Jacobean theater.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s sisters are elusive and equivocal. They are more like
classical Fates than vernacular witches. The term “weird” at this time
referred specifically to the Fates and the power of prophecy. In order
to suggest something of this nature, and to avoid the modern vernacular
associations of “weird,” our text adopts the Folio-based spelling
“weyard,” suggesting “wayward, marginal.” The sisters are women on the
edge: between society and wilderness, culture and nature, the realm of
the body-politic and the mysteries of the hieratic.</p>
