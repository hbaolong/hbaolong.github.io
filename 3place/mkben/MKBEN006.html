<h4 id="the-word-incarnadine">THE WORD INCARNADINE</h4>
<p>The forms of Shakespeare’s verse loosened and became more flexible as
he matured as a writer. His early plays have a higher proportion of
rhyme and a greater regularity in rhythm, the essential pattern being
that of iambic pentameter (ten syllables, five stresses, the stress on
every second syllable). In the early plays, lines are very frequently
end-stopped: punctuation marks a pause at the line ending, meaning that
the movement of the syntax (the grammatical construction) falls in with
that of the meter (the rhythmical construction). In the later plays,
there are far fewer rhyming couplets (sometimes rhyme features only as a
marker to indicate that a scene is ending) and the rhythmic movement has
far greater variety, freedom, and flow. Mature Shakespearean blank
(unrhymed) verse is typically not end-stopped but “run on” (a feature
known as “enjambment”): instead of pausing heavily at the line ending,
the speaker hurries forward, the sense demanded by the grammar working
in creative tension against the holding pattern of the meter. The
heavier pauses migrate to the middle of the lines (where they are known
as the “caesura” and where their placing varies). Much more often than
in the early plays, a single line of verse is shared between two
speakers. And the pentameter itself becomes a more subtle instrument:
the iambic beat is broken up, there is often an extra (“redundant”)
unstressed eleventh syllable at the end of the line (known as a
“feminine ending”). There are more modulations between verse and prose.
Occasionally the verse is so loose that neither the original typesetters
of the plays when they were first printed nor the modern editors of
scholarly texts can be entirely certain whether verse or prose is
intended. The iambic pentamenter is the ideal medium for dramatic poetry
in English because its rhythm and duration seem to fall in naturally
with the speech patterns of the language. In its capacity to combine the
ordinary variety of speech with the heightened precision of poetry, the
supple, mature Shakespearean “loose pentameter” is perhaps the most
expressive vocal instrument ever given to the actor.</p>
<p>Open the text of Macbeth at random and you are guaranteed almost
immediately to find a strong example of this loose pentameter. In a
first test of this claim, the script fell open at the end of Act 5 Scene
5. A messenger brings news of Birnam Wood: “Within this three mile may
you see it coming: / I say, a moving grove.” The announcement ends on an
abrupt half line, so Macbeth speaks the other half:</p>
<p>If thou speak’st false,</p>
<p>Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive</p>
<p>Till famine cling thee …</p>
<p>As if in imitation of what is being said, Shakespeare makes the verse
“hang alive” at the line ending: instead of a deadening end-stop, there
is the most momentary pause before we tumble headlong into the next
line. The heavy pause then comes in the very middle of the line (after
the fifth syllable, not the more customary fourth or sixth). When he
turns away from the messenger, Macbeth goes into meditative mode. He
soliloquizes even though he is not alone:</p>
<p>I pull in resolution, and begin</p>
<p>To doubt th’equivocation of the fiend</p>
<p>That lies like truth.…</p>
<p>The flow of his thought is enacted in the running on of the lines:
“begin / To doubt,” “the fiend / That lies.”</p>
<p>Always in Shakespeare, metrical innovation goes alongside verbal
invention: “cling thee” is what you would expect a lover to do, not
starvation. Simile and metaphor are among the key building blocks of his
poetry. “Was the hope drunk / Wherein you dressed yourself?” Lady
Macbeth chides her husband, “And wakes it now, to look so green and
pale?” The waking image is a superbly accurate imagining of a severe
hangover. The ingenuity of the comparison comes from the application of
something so physical as the bodily symptoms of a hangover to something
so psychological as the idea of “hope.” We are eased into the
physicality by “dressed.” Clothing is one of the similes through which
the play repeatedly embodies abstractions that denote social status:</p>
<p>New honours come upon him,</p>
<p>Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould</p>
<p>But with the aid of use.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>…now does he feel his title</p>
<p>Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe</p>
<p>Upon a dwarfish thief.</p>
<p>Metaphors are usually most powerful when they link things from very
different frames of reference; for instance, the amplitude of “life”
itself and the confinement of “a poor player / That struts and frets his
hour upon the stage / And then is heard no more.” Within this metaphor
there are further configurations of multiple meaning: “poor”
simultaneously suggests “mere,” “ill-paid,” and “unskillful,” while
“frets” suggests “wears out,” “worries his way through,” and “rants.”
But when Macbeth begins to doubt the “equivocation of the fiend”—at this
point he is with his last remaining follower, who rejoices in the name
of “Seyton” (a dark pun: the name may be pronounced “Satan”)—he comes up
with a simile that links things from the same frame of reference: “That
lies like truth.” To lie and to tell the truth at one and the same time:
that is true equivocation, literally the vocation—the voicing—of things
that are equal but opposite.</p>
<p>The play does it all the time, from the first appearance of the
weyard sisters (“When the battle’s lost and won,” “Fair is foul, and
foul is fair”) through Macbeth’s first entrance (“So foul and fair a day
I have not seen”) to Ross’s moving tribute to old Siward’s battle-slain
son (“He only lived but till he was a man.… But like a man he died”). In
this world, even the ornithology palters with us in a double sense:
“Light thickens, / And the crow makes wing to the rooky wood.”
Simultaneously like and unlike: the crow is a large black bird that
feeds upon the carcasses of beasts and that lives in pairs (fittingly,
in that Macbeth is at this point speaking to Lady Macbeth), while rooks,
though closely related to crows, are sociable birds that live in vast
colonies. Crow and rook are both similar and different, as Macbeth is
both similar to and different from the other thanes. Rooks live in
rookeries, but the adjective “rooky” is a Shakespearean coinage that
plays brilliantly on an old dialect word “rawky” or “roky”: as one
dictionary has it, “We say it is a rooky day, when the air is thick and
the light of consequence feeble.”</p>
<p>Language in Macbeth is thickened to a viscous texture. Like that of
clotted blood. Another form of what might be called poetic equivocation
is the restatement of the same idea in two different idioms:</p>
<p>Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood</p>
<p>Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather</p>
<p>The multitudinous seas incarnadine,</p>
<p>Making the green one red.</p>
<p>The two latter lines say the same thing twice, first in erudite
Latinate polysyllables, then in plain monosyllabic Anglo-Saxon colors.
Shakespeare holds together the complex linguistic inheritance of English
at the time of his mother tongue’s richest expansion. He speaks in one
line to his educated and elevated courtly audience, then in the next to
the ordinary people, the penny-paying groundlings. Macbeth is a play
steeped in stage blood, but perhaps its greatest achievement is to
incarnate—to incarnadine—the hot blood of life into the evanescent
breath of the poetic word.</p>
