<h4 id="the-kings-play">THE KING’S PLAY</h4>
<p>Macbeth is a play about how dreams may become nightmares, how a
castle that by day seems the pleasant seat of nesting birds is
transformed by night into hell itself—with a grimly witty Porter at the
gate. And how the world may be turned upside down: the sun refuses to
rise the morning after Duncan has been killed and other strange
phenomena are interpreted as disruptions of the natural order.</p>
<p>The English court, in contrast, is represented as a haven, a place of
grace and “healing benediction.” Malcolm’s stay in England serves as an
education into virtue. His conquest of Scotland, with the worthy English
Siward in support, is made to seem like a restoration of nature, the
moving trees of Birnam symbolic of spring and rebirth. The play was
written in the first few years after King James united the thrones of
Scotland and England: Macduff’s final entrance with the tyrant’s head
and his announcement that the time is free express hope for an end to
the uncertainty about the nation’s future which had attended the final
years of the Virgin Queen’s reign.</p>
<p>Within weeks of James VI of Scotland becoming James I of England in
1603, Shakespeare’s acting company were given the title “The King’s
Men.” In return for this honor, they were expected to play at court
whenever required. They duly gave more command performances at royal
events than any of their rivals: between ten and twenty shows per year
for the rest of Shakespeare’s career.</p>
<p>Two years after his accession, in the summer of 1605, King James
visited Oxford University. At the gates of St. John’s College, there
emerged from an arbor of ivy three undergraduates cross-dressed in the
female garb of prophetesses or “sibyls” from classical antiquity. The
first hailed him as King of Scotland, the second as King of England, and
the third as King of Ireland. They reminded him that three prophesying
sisters had told the ancient Scottish thane Banquo that, though he would
not be king himself, his descendants would one day rule an immortal
empire. Some time before, James himself had commissioned a family tree
that traced the Stuart line back to Banquo and Fleance: the sisters were
now reconfirming their prophecy.</p>
<p>Macbeth was almost certainly performed in the king’s presence,
possibly in the summer of 1606 during a visit from the Danish king. This
may explain why Norway is made Scotland’s enemy in the opening battle,
where it was Denmark in the Chronicles that were Shakespeare’s source.
Macbeth is steeped in the preoccupations of the new king: the rights of
royal succession, the relationship between England and Scotland, the
reality of witchcraft, the sacred powers of the monarch (James revived
the ancient custom of “touching” his subjects in order to cure them of
scrofula, “the king’s evil”). And there was one enduring concern
inherited from his predecessor’s reign: anxiety about high treason and
Roman Catholic plots. The Porter’s reference to “equivocation” has often
been seen as an allusion to the verbal cunning shown by Father Garnet,
leader of the British Jesuit community and confessor to the Gunpowder
Plot conspirators, during his trial in the early months of 1606.</p>
<p>“Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none,” says the Third Witch to
Banquo. When Macbeth returns to the weyard sisters in the second half of
the play he sees a vision of the generations begotten by Banquo: “A show
of eight kings and Banquo last: with a glass in his hand.” Some critics
have supposed that the glass was a mirror pointed at King James sitting
in the audience, creating a reflection of his image onstage as Banquo’s
ghost walks behind. It is more likely to have been a representation of a
magic crystal of the sort that was supposed to contain visions of the
future. In dramatic terms, there is perhaps also an echo of the diamond
given by Banquo to Macbeth on the night of the murder just before he
sees another vision, that of a dagger with its handle toward his hand.
Whatever the precise nature of the glass, there can be little doubt that
the king imagined within it is James, the “two-fold balls” representing
the orbs of Scotland and England, the “treble sceptres” denoting his
claim to be King of Great Britain, Ireland, and France.</p>
