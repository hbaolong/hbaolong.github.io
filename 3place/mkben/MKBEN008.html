  <title>麦克白EN:Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio in a much more thoroughgoing way than in the Quartos. Sometimes, however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets. Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars playhouse that the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running scene count in the right margin at the beginning of each new scene, in the typeface used for editorial directions. Where there is a scene break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene continues. There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgment in making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the pace of the plays.</title>

and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio in a much more
thoroughgoing way than in the Quartos. Sometimes, however, they were

of editorial judgment in making such calls, but the system is very
valuable in suggesting the pace of the plays.</h4>
<p>Speakers’ Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavor of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of each line. The Folio printers sometimes set verse
as prose, and vice versa (either out of misunderstanding or for reasons
of space). We have silently corrected in such cases, although in some
instances there is ambiguity, in which case we have leaned toward the
preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes uses contraction (“turnd”
rather than “turned”) to indicate whether or not the final “-ed” of a
past participle is sounded, an area where there is variation for the
sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We use the convention of
a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus “turnèd” would be two
syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In cases where one
speaker ends with a verse half line and the next begins with the other
half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth century have
indented the second line. We have abandoned this convention, since the
Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in the Shakespearean
theater. An exception is made when the second speaker actively
interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are very occasionally
maintained where necessary for rhythm or aural effect.</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. “Colon” was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semicolon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating how many
Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a developing argument
that gives the illusion of enacting the process of thinking in the
moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of punctuation in classical
times as a way of assisting the actor and orator: the comma suggests the
briefest of pauses for breath, the colon a middling one, and a full stop
or period a longer pause. Semicolons, by contrast, belong to an era of
punctuation that was only just coming in during Shakespeare’s time and
that is coming to an end now: we have accordingly used them only where
they occur in our copy texts (and not always then). Dashes are sometimes
used for parenthetical interjections where the Folio has brackets. They
are also used for interruptions and changes in train of thought. Where a
change of addressee occurs within a speech, we have used a dash preceded
by a full stop (or occasionally another form of punctuation). Often the
identity of the respective addressees is obvious from the context. When
it is not, this has been indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. “[and Attendants]”). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt, and Manet anglicized to “remains.” We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors.</p>
<p>Editorial Stage Directions such as stage business, asides,
indications of addressee and of characters’ position on the gallery
stage are only used sparingly in Folio. Other editions mingle directions
of this kind with original Folio and Quarto directions, sometimes
marking them by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing them in
the right margin in a smaller typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address—it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Line Numbers are editorial, for reference and to key the explanatory
and textual notes.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes explain allusions and gloss obsolete and difficult
words, confusing phraseology, occasional major textual cruces, and so
on. Particular attention is given to non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo,
and technical terms (e.g. legal and military language). Where more than
one sense is given, commas indicate shades of related meaning, slashes
alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of the play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with “F2”
indicating a reading that derives from the Second Folio of 1632, “F3”
one that derives from the Third Folio of 1663–64, and “Ed” that it
derives from the subsequent editorial tradition. The rejected Folio
(“F”) reading is then given. Thus for Act 3 Scene 6 line 25: “son = Ed.
F = Sonnes” means that the Folio text refers to Duncan’s two sons, where
the context clearly demands one, so we have corrected to the singular.
It is possible, of course, in this case that the mistake is
Shakespeare’s, not the printer’s: he might have forgotten that he sent
Donalbain to Ireland and only Malcolm to England. The editorial task is
a never-ending process of conjecture and debate.</p>
