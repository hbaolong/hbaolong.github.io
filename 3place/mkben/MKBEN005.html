<h4 id="how-many-children">HOW MANY CHILDREN?</h4>
<p>Why was King James so interested in witches? The main reason was that
his ideology of kingship was closely bound to a cosmology of good and
evil. He believed passionately in the idea that the monarch was God’s
representative on earth. The king was the embodiment of virtue, blessed
with the power to heal his people and restore cosmic harmony. The idea
that the devil was active in the world through the dark agency of
witchcraft was the necessary antithesis of this vision. The imagery of
Shakespeare’s play creates a pervasive sense of connection between the
state and the cosmos: witness those signs of disruption in the order of
nature reported by Lennox and Ross on the night of Duncan’s murder.</p>
<p>Another consequence of James’s theory of kingship was the idea that
royal succession was divinely ordained rather than achieved arbitrarily
through a struggle between rival candidates or through a popular vote.
It is therefore extremely significant that in Holinshed’s Chronicles
Duncan’s anointing of his son Malcolm as Prince of Cumberland is a
turning point in Scottish history: this is the moment when the principle
of primogeniture is established in Scotland. In Holinshed, Macbeth is
Duncan’s cousin and until this moment he has the right to the succession
in the event of Duncan dying before Malcolm comes of age.</p>
<p>In the mid-twentieth century there was a tendency among critics to
mock the Victorian scholar A. C. Bradley for treating Shakespeare’s
characters as if they were real people, with a past and a life beyond
that which is seen onstage. The shorthand term for this mockery was
Bradley’s question, “How many children had Lady Macbeth?” But Bradley
has outlasted his critics: to a greater degree than any other writer
prior to the flowering of the realist novel, Shakespeare did use
language to create the illusion that his characters have an interior
life and that there is a “backstory” to his plots. The language of
Macbeth is steeped in images of children, of birth, of inheritance and
future generations. The sons of Duncan, Banquo, and Macduff are all
crucial to the action, and there is even a telling bit part for the son
of the English soldier Siward. No other Shakespearean tragedy has so
many significant male children in the cast. Only Macbeth is without a
son. Hence his appalled realization that he has a barren sceptre in his
hand, that his bloody deeds have been done only “to make them kings, the
seeds of Banquo kings.”</p>
<p>Shakespeare doesn’t usually portray married couples working together
as partners. There are moments of exceptional tenderness between the
Macbeths. Yet there is an emptiness at the core of their relationship.
The play is scarred by images of sterility and harrowed by glimpses of
dead babies. Is power in the end a substitute for love, ambition nothing
but compensation for the sorrow of childlessness? It has to be assumed
that Lady Macbeth means what she says when she speaks of having “given
suck” and of knowing “how tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me”:
we can only assume that the Macbeths have had a child and lost it.
Perhaps that is why they channel the energies of their marriage into the
lust for power instead.</p>
<p>Shakespeare is the least autobiographical of great writers, but can
it be entirely a coincidence that, a decade before, he too had lost a
child, his only son Hamnet, and that in the years since then he had
channeled all his creative powers not into a family but into his work,
his theater company, and the thrill of those extraordinary occasions
when he found himself—a grammar boy from the provinces with no
university education—witnessing the King of England and Scotland, with
all his court, listening in rapt attention as his words were spoken from
the platform of the banqueting hall in the royal palace?</p>
