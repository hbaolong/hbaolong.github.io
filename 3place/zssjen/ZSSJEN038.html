<h4 id="mumbais-glorious-art-deco-legacy-at-100">Mumbai’s glorious Art
Deco legacy at 100</h4>
<p>It was at a landmark architecture exhibition in Paris in 1925 that
the Art Deco aesthetic first exploded on the scene.</p>
<p>In the 100 years since, the glamorous building style - evocative of
neon-lit jazz bars and the golden age of big motion pictures - rapidly
spread around the world.</p>
<p>It moved from the famous pastel hotel facades of Miami’s South Beach
to the sprawling necklace of mansion apartments along Mumbai’s Marine
Drive seafront.</p>
<p>Art Deco’s distinct motifs - typified by geometrical</p>
<p>In a short time, the style transcended architecture to influence the
design sensibility of home interiors, furniture, fonts, jewellery and
some of the world’s most iconic cinema halls - from Radio City Music
Hall in New York City to Regal, Liberty and Eros cinemas in Mumbai.</p>
<p>“It represented hope, optimism and speed, coinciding with the
emergence of the motor car and also concrete as a building material,
which when compared with stone, could be worked with in a tenth of the
time and fifth of the cost,“ Atul Kumar, founder of the Art Deco Mumbai
Trust and curator of a new exhibition celebrating the centenary of Art
Deco in the city, told the BBC.</p>
<p>“It was not elaborate like Victorian Gothic design that preceded it,
and came with a classicism and simplicity that has survived the test of
time,“ he said.</p>
<p>And nowhere has that been more apparent than in Mumbai, which,
according to Mr Kumar, is home to the world’s largest documented
collection of Art Deco buildings. Other estimates put Mumbai in the
second spot behind Miami.</p>
<p>What made Mumbai’s tryst with Art Deco particularly interesting was
how the city embraced its hallmarks in a truly all-encompassing
manner.</p>
<p>Just like Miami, the style emerged in the city at a time of economic
flux and transformation, spurred by its modern, mercantile port-city
energy.</p>
<p>But unlike Miami where it “arrived as a projection of leisure or
spectacle“, in Mumbai the “style resonated across various building
typologies, including schools, cinemas, bungalows, petrol stations and
banks,“ Mr Kumar said.</p>
<p>Art Deco buildings in Mumbai were, and still often are, hidden in
plain sight, with even their occupants often blissfully unaware of their
cultural moorings.</p>
<p>But their all-pervading architectural shadow over the city is perhaps
why Art Deco is “seeped into the larger public imagination, and remains
relevant in Mumbai’s emotional quotient“, Mr Kumar added.</p>
<p>The style was brought to Mumbai at a time when it was under colonial
rule.</p>
<p>It was India’s first bunch of home-grown architects - pivotal figures
like Chimanlal Master, Laxman Vishnu Sathe and Gopalji Mulji Bhuta - who
integrated it into their designs after returning home with degrees from
the Royal Institute of British Architects in London.</p>
<p>“They were suddenly exposed to new European sensibilities and wanted
to bring them back to their country, which was deeply colonised by the
imposition of Victorian buildings,“ Mr Kumar said.</p>
<p>But they adapted Art Deco and vernacularised it, throwing in native
design patterns, drawing inspiration from disparate local elements
including ocean liners docked at Mumbai’s ports and even lattice screens
that are so typical of Mughal architecture.</p>
<p>The British were initially dismissive, calling Art Deco “lesser
architecture“, but were presumably threatened, said Mr Kumar, as it
signalled the dawn of a new age and of new identities that were shaping
India’s public spaces.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before South Mumbai’s skyline would
become a rich confluence of Indo-Saracenic, Gothic and Art Deco
buildings.</p>
<p>Today, Mumbai is yet again a city in rapid flux - its building code
governed by real estate moguls trying to maximise the floor space index,
giving way to utilitarian rather than stylistic considerations.</p>
<p>Dozens of Art Deco buildings have been erased to give way to glass
and steel facades, and hundreds more are under threat.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Mr Kumar has documented more than 1,500
buildings that are truly representative of the style, but only 70-odd of
those are protected.</p>
<p>Authorities are apathetic to their preservation, so his organisation
is engaging directly with people, offering pro-bono repair and
restoration consultancies to prevent them from giving away their
properties to builders for redevelopment.</p>
<p>“The response has been positive as people have seen the value of
their real estate go up after the renovations,“ said Mr Kumar.</p>
<p>Then there are others, like architect and designer Nidhi Tekwani, who
is re-imagining Art Deco objects and hoping to adapt them for a
contemporary context.</p>
<p>For example, Art Deco furniture was often bulky, its light fittings
were meant for high ceilings, and its dressing tables too elaborate for
today’s compact apartments. Ms Tekwani aims to design and launch
products that are sleeker while preserving core Art Deco principles.</p>
<p>“The hope is to translate it to something modern and well-fitting of
our current lifestyle requirements,“ said Ms Tekwani of her efforts to
keep Art Deco a living tradition in a city that’s remaking itself
between one blink and the next.</p>
