id="ukraines-allies-voice-concerns-over-us-plan-to-end-war">Ukraine’s
allies voice concerns over US plan to end war</h4>
<p>Ukraine’s allies from Europe, Canada and Japan have voiced concerns
over a US plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, saying it “will require
additional work“.</p>
<p>In a statement, they said the plan had elements “essential for a just
and lasting peace“, but cited concerns over border changes and
limitations on Ukraine’s forces.</p>
<p>Security officials from the UK, France, Germany, the US and Ukraine
will now meet in Geneva, Switzerland, on Sunday for further talks.</p>
<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier warned Ukraine faced “one of the
most difficult moments in our history“ over pressure from the US to
accept the plan - leaked details of which are seen as favourable to
Moscow.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump has given Ukraine until 27 November to
accept the 28-point plan, while Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said
it could be the “basis“ for a settlement.</p>
<p>Saturday’s joint statement at the G20 summit in South Africa was
signed by the leaders of Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany and Norway. Two top EU officials
were also among the signatories.</p>
<p>The statement said: “We believe therefore that the draft is a basis
which will require additional work. We are ready to engage in order to
ensure that a future peace is sustainable. <strong>We are clear on the
principle that borders must not be changed by force.</strong></p>
<p>“We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed
forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.“</p>
<p>It added: “The implementation of elements relating to the European
Union and relating to Nato would need the consent of EU and Nato members
respectively“.</p>
<p>The widely leaked US peace plan proposes Ukrainian troops withdraw
from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control,
and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring
Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in
2014.</p>
<p>The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine’s southern
Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both
regions are partially occupied by Russia.</p>
<p>The US draft would also limit Ukraine’s military to 600,000
personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring
Poland.</p>
<p>Kyiv would receive “reliable security guarantees“, the plan says,
although no details have been given. The document says “it is expected“
that Russia will not invade its neighbours and Nato will not expand
further.</p>
<p>The plan also suggests Russia will be “reintegrated into the global
economy“, through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to
rejoin the G7 group of the world’s most powerful countries - making it
the G8 again.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump said Zelensky would “have to like“ the US proposals,
adding otherwise Ukraine and Russia would continue fighting.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader addressed the nation with a
stark warning that the country “might face a very difficult choice:
either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner“.</p>
<p>“<strong>Today is one of the most difficult moments in our
history</strong>,“ Zelensky added, pledging to work “constructively“
with the Americans on the plan.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Zelensky announced his head of office Andriy Yermak
would lead Ukraine’s negotiating team for future talks on a peace deal,
including any that may involve Russia.</p>
<p>“Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine’s national interests
and exactly what must be done to prevent Russia from launching a third
invasion, another strike against Ukraine,“ the president said in a video
statement posted on social media.</p>
<p>Kyiv is critically dependent on deliveries of US-made advanced
weaponry, including air defence systems to repel deadly Russian air
assaults, as well as intelligence provided by Washington.</p>
<p>Putin on Friday confirmed Moscow had received the US plan - but said
it had not been discussed with the Kremlin in detail.</p>
<p>He added Moscow was willing to “show flexibility“ - but was also
prepared to fight on.</p>
<p>Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
<p>In recent months, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in
Ukraine’s south-eastern region - despite reported heavy combat
casualties.</p>
