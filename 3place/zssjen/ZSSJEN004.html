hopes to reach phase two of Gaza ceasefire ‘very quickly’</h4>
<p>Donald Trump said he hoped to reach phase two of the Gaza peace plan
“very quickly“, as he warned Hamas would have “hell to pay“ if it did
not disarm quickly.</p>
<p>The US president, whose 20-point peace plan requires the militant
group to disarm, made the comments as he met Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida for talks on Monday.</p>
<p>During a press conference with Netanyahu after their meeting, Trump
said Israel had “lived up to the plan 100%“, despite continuing attacks
by its military in Gaza.</p>
<p>The US president also said his country could support another major
strike on Iran were it to resume rebuilding its ballistic missile or
nuclear weapons programmes.</p>
<p>Asked how quickly Hamas and Israel should move to phase two of the
peace plan, Trump said: “As quickly as we can. But there has to be
disarmament.“</p>
<p>Speaking about Hamas, he said: “If they don’t disarm as, as they
agreed to do, they agreed to it, and then there will be hell to pay for
them.</p>
<p>“They have to disarm in a fairly short period of time“.</p>
<p>Trump also said reconstruction in Gaza could “begin pretty soon“.</p>
<p>The Gaza peace plan came into effect in October. Under the second
phase, a technocratic government would be established in the devastated
territory, Hamas would disarm and Israeli troops would withdraw. The
reconstruction of Gaza would then begin.</p>
<p>But critics have suggested Netanyahu could seek to delay the process
of the plan and instead push for Hamas to disarm before Israeli troops
withdraw.</p>
<p>The Israeli prime minister has been accused of not wanting to engage
seriously with the issue of a political future for Palestinians.</p>
<p>Hamas officials have said a full disarmament should take place
alongside progress towards an independent Palestinian state.</p>
<p>Asked if he was concerned Israel was not moving quickly enough to
phase two of the plan, Trump said it had “lived up to the plan“.</p>
<p>“I’m not concerned about anything that Israel’s doing, I’m concerned
about what other people are doing or maybe aren’t doing,“ he added.</p>
<p>Since the ceasefire came into effect, at least 414 Palestinians have
been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run
health ministry.</p>
<p>The Israeli military, which controls more than half of Gaza, has said
it has only opened fire in response to ceasefire violations. It has
blamed Hamas for the killings of three Israeli soldiers over the same
period.</p>
<p>During the press briefing, Trump also warned that the US would launch
further attacks on Iran if it was found to be using different sites to
develop nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>In June, Trump claimed US air and missile strikes “obliterated“
Iran’s nuclear facilities. Iran has denied seeking to develop nuclear
weapons.</p>
<p>“I hope they’re not trying to build up again, because if they are
we’re going to have no choice but to eradicate that build up,“ he
said.</p>
<p>Trump said he “had been reading“ that the country was using “possibly
different sites“ to those targeted in summer.</p>
<p>Iran, which fought a 12-day war with Israel in June, on Monday
denounced the reports as a “psychological operation“ against Tehran.</p>
<p>It said it was fully prepared to defend itself, and warned renewed
aggression would “result in harsher consequences“ for Israel.</p>
<p>Trump and Netanyahu’s talks also focused on other regional tension
points, including Syria and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel was keen to ensure a peaceful
border with Syria, and Trump said he hoped Israel would get along with
President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who took power after longtime strongman
Bashar al-Assad was deposed last year.</p>
<p>Israel has been suspicious of the new leader, who was once a member
of al-Qaeda, and bombed government buildings in Damascus in July.</p>
<p>“Well, I hope he’s [Netanyahu] going to get along with Syria because
the new president of Syria is working very hard to do a good job,“ Trump
said.</p>
<p>“He really is. I know he’s a tough cookie. And, you know, you’re not
going to get a choir boy to lead Syria.“</p>
<p>Trump signed an executive order in June to end US sanctions against
Syria.</p>
