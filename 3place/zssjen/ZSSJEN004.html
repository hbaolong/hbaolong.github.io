India’s delayed action plan raises eyebrows at UN climate summit</h4>
<p>At this year’s UN climate summit (COP30), under way in Brazil’s Belem
city, all eyes are on India - the world’s third largest carbon
emitter.</p>
<p>India has not yet submitted a key climate plan that countries are
required to do every five years, even as international assessments have
deemed India’s climate action as being “worryingly inadequate“. Delhi
has argued otherwise.</p>
<p>Known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the updated plan
from each member country to the UN Framework Climate Convention (UNFCC)
is expected to have more ambitious carbon reduction targets as the world
has failed to make the required level of cuts to avoid dangerous global
warming.</p>
<p>So far, around 120 of the 196 member countries of the UNFCCC have
submitted their updated plans and India is among the remaining ones.</p>
<p>The Paris climate agreement signed in 2015 has the goal of limiting
average global temperature rise to well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C
to avert drastic climate change.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>But emissions have continued to rise almost every year since then,
and the</p>
<p>UNEP warns that current emission policies put the world on track for
2.8C of warming this century, underscoring the need for far more
ambitious carbon-cutting targets.</p>
<p>The first deadline for the updated climate plan (NDC3) was February,
but it was extended until September as more than 90% of member countries
failed to meet it.</p>
<p>All eyes were on top emitters like China, India and the European
Union, also because US President Donald Trump once again announced his
country’s exit from the Paris agreement, leaving the world wondering if
other major emitters would offer to plug the gap.</p>
<p>But many countries missed the September deadline too. While some
began to submit their plans before COP30, there were expectations that
the remaining would do so during the climate meet in Belem.</p>
<p>Some have done so, but India kept the world guessing until
environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who led the country’s delegation
in Belem, told the media this week that Delhi would submit its plan only
by the end of December.</p>
<p>So, why has India delayed submitting its climate plan, even though it
could mean inviting negative press during COP30?</p>
<p>Though it has not explained its stance, Delhi appears keen to
highlight a view shared by many developing nations: that rich countries
bear historic responsibility to slash emissions and provide far greater
financial support to the developing world.</p>
<p>A week before COP30 kicked off, Yadav wrote an opinion piece in the
Economic Times newspaper where he argued that “global climate progress
can’t come from endless discussions alone“.</p>
<p>“For too long, the world has been caught in a cycle of negotiations,
while the planet’s distress signal grows louder. While dialogue is
important, action is imperative,“ he wrote.</p>
<p>While</p>
<p>“Developed countries must reach net zero far earlier than current
target dates and deliver new, additional and concessional climate
finance at a scale of trillions, not billions,“ he said.</p>
<p>Indian officials, like many negotiators from the developing world,
argue that their updated climate plans with more ambitious carbon
reduction targets will mean nothing if they do not receive financial and
technological support from developed countries.</p>
<p>The Paris climate agreement requires developed countries to provide
financial support to the developing world, but it has remained a
contentious issue.</p>
<p>The last COP in Baku, Azerbaijan, saw angry reactions from the
developing world when developed countries said they would provide 00bn
(£229bn) annually as climate finance by 2035, while poor countries were
demanding more than tn.</p>
<p>Developing countries also say there has been no clarity and
transparency on how the 00bn will be provided, and that developed
countries are pushing for private finance which will burden poor
countries with loans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some developed countries have argued that fast-emerging
economies like China and India should also contribute to the global
climate finance pot.</p>
<p>“The best way to make sure that Europe can sustain that [the climate
finance it has been providing] is by inviting others who have the
ability to do so… to chip in,“ Wopke Hoekstra, climate commissioner at
the European Commission, told a press conference at COP30.</p>
<p>Without naming any country, he said in many cases (such other
countries) have far higher GDP per capita than a vast majority of
European member states.</p>
<p>India says it shouldn’t be pressed for a more ambitious climate plan
as it has already met a key pledge - to have 50% of its installed
electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources - years ahead of the
2030 deadline.</p>
<p>Global assessments praise this but also flag other challenges.</p>
<p>Climate Action Tracker - an independent scientific project that
tracks government climate action and measures it against the globally
agreed Paris agreement - has rated India’s climate targets and actions
as “</p>
<p>It has pointed out that coal’s share in India’s total electricity
generation continues to be around 75%, while it must drop to at least
19% to align the country’s climate action with the global goal of
limiting temperature rise to 1.5C.</p>
<p>Another report released at COP30 has also underscored India’s
over-dependence on coal.</p>
<p>In the</p>
<p>“India’s national pathway is still anchored in coal and there is no
national coal exit timeline and new coal blocks continue to be
auctioned,“ a report by the think-tank noted.</p>
<p>According to the recent</p>
<p>But the world’s largest carbon emitter China, usually India’s ally at
climate negotiations to counter developed countries, has already
submitted its updated climate plan.</p>
<p>And now COP30 is also discussing whether there should be an
announcement of a roadmap for the world to transition away from fossil
fuels.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if criticism around India’s dependence on coal
will influence its updated climate plan, which it has committed to
submit before this year ends.</p>
