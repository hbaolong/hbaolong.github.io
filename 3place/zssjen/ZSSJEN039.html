6, Resident Evil 9, AI and EA: Gaming trends to watch in 2026</h4>
<p>The video games industry is unpredictable.</p>
<ul>
<li>unpredictable,英 [ˌʌnprɪˈdɪktəbl] 美 [ˌʌnprɪˈdɪktəb(ə)l] adj.
无法预测的，不定的；（人）善变的，难以捉摸的 n. 不可预言的事</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d told us this time last year that a previously unknown French
studio would claim game of the year, Battlefield 6 would knock Call of
Duty off the top of the annual charts and that Saudi Arabia would buy
gaming giant Electronic Arts (EA) we’d have been… sceptical.</p>
<p>So you’d have to be very sure of yourself - or very foolish - to try
and predict what’s going to happen in the year ahead.</p>
<p>Luckily, we’re not in the crystal ball business here at BBC Newsbeat,
but there are a few things we can be confident video game fans should
keep an eye on in 2026.</p>
<p>Whether it’s big releases, big moves or big issues - here’s a rundown
of some of the most important things to look out for.</p>
<p>“A cultural moment, a day millions of players have been awaiting for
a very, very long time.“</p>
<p>Sound familiar? It should. It’s what we wrote about Grand Theft Auto
6 this time last year.</p>
<p>Two delays and one new trailer later, and we’re more or less where we
were 12 months ago.</p>
<p>Assuming it comes out, as planned, on 19 November, it will almost
certainly break records.</p>
<p>And you can bet other publishers will want to release their own 2026
games as far away from it as possible.</p>
<p>But the big question remains: “Will it get delayed again?“</p>
<p>Publisher Take Two says it’s confident the new date will hold, but it
remains to be seen whether developer Rockstar’s recent sacking of 31
staff - which included experienced team members - will affect the
game.</p>
<p>Read more:</p>
<p>Like this year, when publishers manoeuvered around GTA 6’s original
“late 2025“ release date, 2026 is front-loaded with significant
releases.</p>
<p>Japanese giant Capcom unleashes</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem</p>
<p>, the ninth main entry in its blockbuster horror series, in February,
followed by sci-fi action adventure</p>
<p>Pragmata</p>
<p>in April.</p>
<p>Sony</p>
<p>is also planning to drop PlayStation exclusive</p>
<p>Saros</p>
<p>, a follow-up to 2021’s widely-praised Returnal, in April.</p>
<p>While</p>
<p>Wolverine,</p>
<p>he next superhero smash from Spider-Man studio Insomniac - another
in-house Sony developer - is set to arrive in the autumn.</p>
<p>May will see the arrival of</p>
<p>007 First Light</p>
<ul>
<li>the celeb-filled James Bond adventure from Hitman developer IO
Interactive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nintendo</p>
<p>will be looking to maintain the momentum of its record-breaking
Switch 2 launch this year.</p>
<p>Ones to watch include</p>
<p>Pokopia</p>
<ul>
<li>a cosy take on Pokémon - and online multiplayer</li>
</ul>
<p>The Duskbloods</p>
<p>from Elden Ring maker FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Fans have complained about the lack of a brand new Mario or Zelda
game and, as things stand, neither has been announced yet. But the
company’s got form for announcing big new games mere months before they
release.</p>
<p>Microsoft</p>
<p>recently teased big reveals for its January 2026 Developer Direct
showcase and, unless we’re told otherwise, is due to release</p>
<p>Fable</p>
<ul>
<li>its reboot of the</li>
</ul>
<p>very</p>
<p>British fantasy RPG series - and</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day</p>
<p>sometime during the year.</p>
<p>Marking 25 years of its</p>
<p>Xbox</p>
<p>brand could also give the company a chance to win back fans after
backlashes over studio closures, price rises to its Game Pass
subscription service and its decision to release flagship series on
rival consoles.</p>
<p>And that’s just the major publishers. Expect more indie surprises to
take centre stage next year.</p>
<p>Our one-to-watch is</p>
<p>Raccoin</p>
<ul>
<li>a score attack game inspired by arcade coin-pusher machines.</li>
</ul>

<p>Random-access memory, or RAM, is a vital component in millions of
electronic devices including smartphones, Smart TVs, medical equipment
and even cars.</p>
<p>It’s also been getting really, really expensive.</p>
<p>Demand from Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centre projects has
been blamed, with some of the world’s biggest RAM manufacturers pivoting
towards supplying demand from big tech firms.</p>
<p>Micron, owner of the Crucial brand sold in many online and high
street shops, recently announced it was ceasing its consumer business to
focus on demand from AI companies.</p>
<p>All of which has created a shortage that, according to some analysts,
could eventually push up prices of electronics, with video game consoles
high on the list of potential casualties.</p>
<p>Business website Bloomberg reported that production costs for
Nintendo’s Switch 2 could rise and there are also concerns that Valve’s
upcoming PC-console hybrid Steam Machine could be delayed, or more
expensive, as a result of the situation.</p>
<p>So far, no video game companies have commented.</p>
<p>In the games industry, which has faced thousands of layoffs in recent
years, discussions about generative AI (GenAI) and its impact on jobs
are especially fierce.</p>
<p>Just this month Swen Vincke, the boss of multi-award-winning Baldur’s
Gate 3 maker Larian Studios, faced a backlash when he told interviewers
the company had explored using GenAI for coming up with ideas and early
prototypes.</p>
<p>He said no AI content would appear in its finished games nor replace
human workers but, in a follow-up response, said it would be
“irresponsible“ not to assess new technologies.</p>
<p>Despite early claims that GenAI could allow people to make games more
quickly at a fraction of the current costs, it’s unclear how much of an
impact it’s actually had.</p>
<p>Developers who’ve spoken to BBC Newsbeat say it’s not widely used in
finished products due to a mix of ethical, legal and practical concerns,
but plenty of companies have at least tried using it for pre-production
work.</p>
<p>Some smaller companies proudly state that they don’t use the tools at
any stage of development.</p>
<p>Against a backdrop of uncertainty over the long-term future of GenAI,
it remains to be seen how far its use will spread.</p>
<p>But it’s a topic that fosters strong emotions from players and
workers within the industry, so expect more controversies as the year
ploughs on.</p>
<p>Read more:</p>
<p>Electronic Arts (EA), the publisher of Battlefield 6, EA FC and The
Sims, is one of the world’s biggest video game companies, responsible
for titles that regularly top bestseller charts.</p>
<p>The announcement it had accepted a record-breaking 5bn (£41bn) bid
from a Saudi Arabia-led investment group came as a shock.</p>
<p>It’s the country’s latest big move into gaming, which it says is part
of wider efforts to make its economy less reliant on oil.</p>
<p>But critics believe it’s a form of “sportswashing“ - investing in
entertainment in an attempt to soften its international reputation due
to its anti-LGBT laws and human rights record.</p>
<p>The country’s conservative cultural values have prompted concerns
over the impact the deal could have on certain EA series.</p>
<p>The Sims, which has a big LGBT fanbase, faced a revolt from some of
its best-known content creators when some cut official ties in protest
against the buyout.</p>
<p>EA replied with a statement saying the game would “always be a space
where you can express your authentic self“.</p>
<p>There are also concerns that the deal could result in further
lay-offs at EA, which has taken on 0bn of debt to finance the
purchase.</p>
<p>If all goes to plan, the deal should be completed by the summer, when
there should be more clarity on the future of some of gaming’s most
popular series.</p>
