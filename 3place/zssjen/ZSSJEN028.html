stand to make bn as they announce mammoth comeback tour</h4>
<ul>
<li>mammoth,英 [ˈmæməθ] 美 [ˈmæməθ] n. 猛犸，毛象；庞然大物 adj.
巨大的，庞大的</li>
</ul>
<p>K-pop idols BTS have announced a globe-spanning, 79-date world tour,
marking their return to the stage after a four-year hiatus.</p>
<ul>
<li>hiatus,英 [haɪˈeɪtəs] 美 [haɪˈeɪtəs]
n. 裂缝，空隙，脱漏部分；间断；元音连读</li>
</ul>
<p>With dates in London, Tokyo, Munich, Sydney and Los Angeles, it’s
likely to be one of the biggest tours of the year, especially as the
band haven’t played outside the US and South Korea since 2019.</p>
<p>Their previous tour set records for a K-pop act - earning about 46m
(£182m) at the global box office. Along the way, BTS became the first
Korean act to headline Wembley Stadium.</p>
<p>The band’s latest trek around the planet will kick off with three
nights in South Korea’s Goyang Stadium on 9 April 2026, before setting
off across Asia, Europe and America.</p>
<ul>
<li>trek,英 [trek] 美 [trek] v.

</ul>
<p>The show will see the band performing on a 360-degree, in-the-round
stage, allowing for more seats to be made available at every venue.</p>
<p>It will hit London for two nights at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on 6
and 7 July. The European leg also includes dates in Paris, Madrid,
Brussels and Munich.</p>
<p>A message on the band’s website said further dates would be announced
in Japan, the Middle East “and more“ for 2027. (See the bottom of this
page for a full list of the dates so far.)</p>
<p>Tickets will be available to fans from 22 January, and the general
public two days later.</p>
<p>According to Billboard, the group and their record label BigHit /
Hybe stand to make more than bn (£740m) from their reunion - derived
from concerts, merchandise, licensing, album sales and streaming
revenue.</p>
<p>During the band’s hiatus in 2024, Hybe’s operating profit dropped by
almost 37.5%, which the company attributed partially to “BTS’ temporary
break“.</p>
<p>Formed in the early 2010s, BTS were at the forefront of popularising
K-pop with mainstream audiences in the west, thanks to their energetic
blend of slick dance pop and hip-hop, and surprisingly introspective
lyrics.</p>
<p>Excitement has been mounting for their comeback ever since rapper and
songwriter Suga completed his 18-month mandatory military service last
June.</p>
<p>He was the last of the septet to return to civilian life, following
his bandmates Jin, J-Hope, V, RM, Jung Kook and Jimin.</p>
<p>When the band announced plans for a comeback in a live broadcast on
the fan platform Weverse last July, more than seven million people tuned
in to watch.</p>
<p>Figures like that indicate there will be a scramble for concert
tickets similar to the sale for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour in 2022, and
Oasis’s reunion tour in 2024.</p>
<p>For many BTS fans, it will be their first chance to see the band
perform live in seven years.</p>
<p>In that time, the group scored their first US number one single with
Dynamite, a fleet-footed pop song that also became their first top 10
hit in the UK.</p>
<p>They followed it up with the throwback disco-funk of Butter, inspired
by Michael Jackson; and a smash collaboration with Coldplay, My
Universe.</p>
<p>However, a world tour planned for 2020 had to be cancelled due to the
Covid-19 pandemic. After restrictions on live music lifted, they only
managed a handful of dates before starting military service.</p>
<p>Their streaming numbers have declined during the hiatus - but various
solo projects have kept hardcore fans invested.</p>
<p>When the band cleared their social media profiles and revealed the
release date for their new album on New Year’s Day, Weverse was so
overwhelmed by fans logging on for information that the platform
crashed.</p>
<p>The album, which has yet to receive a title, was recorded in Los
Angeles over six months last year and will hit streaming services on 20
March.</p>
<p>Band leader RM updated fans on the progress last August, saying the
band were “working diligently“, but admitting it had been “weird“ to
adjust to life outside the military.</p>
<p>“I live, work, and play with the members. It’s a really strange
experience,“ he said.</p>
<p>“Making something ‘together’ with these friends, I’m going to commit
myself to this moment… I’m looking for what I’ll become.“</p>
<p>J-Hope had previously said the band’s various solo projects would
inform the new music.</p>
<p>“I think that over time, we each refined our unique identities as
each of us work on their own music,“ he told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe.
“I’m curious to see how it’ll look like… I think it’s going to be a
massive energy.“</p>
<p>Updating fans in December, RM said “the album is almost here. It
really is on its way.“</p>
<p>“We practiced together yesterday, too,“ he added. “We are filming and
practicing every day.“</p>
<p>BTS sent handwritten letters to their fandom - known collectively as
ARMY - ahead of announcing the new album.</p>
<p>Delivered directly to fans’ homes, the notes expressed gratitude and
excitement about their reunion.</p>
<p>“The year we’ve been waiting for has finally arrived,“ wrote
Jimin.</p>
<p>“We’ve waited more earnestly than anyone else,“ added RM.</p>
<p>Youngest member Jung Kook (who arguably had the most successful solo
career during BTS’s hiatus) struck a tone of humility.</p>
<p>“My heart has always been the same,“ he wrote. “I’ll keep doing my
best, just as I always have.“</p>
<p>And V concluded with a message to fans: “In 2026, we’ll make even
more good memories, so look forward to it!“</p>
