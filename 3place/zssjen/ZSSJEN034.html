to bar 37 aid groups as UK and EU warn of impact in Gaza</h4>
<p>Israel is to revoke the licences of 37 international non-governmental
organisations (INGOs) working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, saying
they failed to meet requirements under new registration rules.</p>
<p>ActionAid, International Rescue Committee, Médecins Sans Frontières
and Norwegian Refugee Council are among the aid agencies which will have
their licences suspended on 1 January, with their operations to end
within 60 days.</p>
<p>Israel said they had, among other things, failed to hand over
“complete“ personal details of their staff. The INGOs said that could
put them at risk.</p>
<p>The move was condemned by 10 countries, which said the rules would
have a severe impact on access to essential services.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the UK, France,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland
said INGOs were integral to the humanitarian response in Gaza and that
any attempt to stem their ability to operate was “unacceptable“.</p>
<p>“Without them, it will be impossible to meet all urgent needs at the
scale required,“ they warned.</p>
<p>The European Union’s humanitarian chief, Hadja Lahbib, said:
“Israel’s plans to block INGOs in Gaza means blocking life-saving
aid.“</p>
<p>International humanitarian law “leaves no room for doubt: aid must
reach those in need,“ she added.</p>
<p>UN human rights chief Volker Türk called the INGO suspensions
“outrageous“ and “arbitrary“, and said they made “an already intolerable
situation even worse for the people of Gaza“.</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory -
a forum that brings together UN agencies and more than 200 local and
international NGOs - urged the Israeli authorities to reconsider the
registration decisions.</p>
<p>It has said INGOs run or support most of Gaza’s field hospitals and
primary healthcare centres, emergency shelter responses, water and
sanitation services, nutrition stabilisation centres for children with
acute malnutrition, and critical mine action activities.</p>
<p>Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs, which oversees registration
applications, said the new measures would not affect the flow of
humanitarian assistance to Gaza.</p>
<p>It said aid continued to be delivered through “approved and vetted
channels“, including UN agencies, bilateral partners, and humanitarian
organisations.</p>
<p>Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza’s crossings and
co-ordinates aid deliveries, meanwhile said the INGOs facing suspension
“did not bring aid into Gaza throughout the current ceasefire“, which
began 11 weeks ago. It added that “even in the past their combined
contribution amounted to only about 1% of the total aid volume“.</p>
<p>The diaspora affairs ministry said the primary reason INGOs had their
licences revoked was “the refusal to provide complete and verifiable
information regarding their employees,“ which it said was critical to
preventing “the infiltration of terrorist operatives into humanitarian
structures“.</p>
<p>Fewer than 15% of the INGOs providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza
were found to be in violation of the new regulatory framework, it
added.</p>
<p>That framework includes several grounds for rejection, including:</p>
<p>The ministry of diaspora affairs also alleged that Israeli
investigations had “determined that individuals affiliated with
[Médecins Sans Frontières] were linked to terrorist organisations,
including the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas“, without providing
any evidence.</p>
<p>“Despite repeated requests, the organisation failed to provide full
disclosure regarding the identities and roles of these individuals,“ it
said.</p>
<p>MSF said it took such allegations extremely seriously and that it
would “never knowingly employ people engaging in military activity“.</p>
<p>“Any employee who engages in military activity would pose a danger to
our staff and our patients. Publicly making such claims without
substantiated evidence puts humanitarian staff at risk and undermines
life-saving medical work,“ it added.</p>
<p>MSF also warned that deregistration by Israeli authorities would
effectively block it from operating in Gaza, “where we support one in
five hospital beds and one in three births, cutting off life-saving
medical assistance for hundreds of thousands of people“.</p>
<p>Norwegian Refugee Council spokeswoman Shaina Low told NPR that it
would no longer be able to bring foreign aid workers into Gaza if it was
deregistered, but that its 200 local staff would continue to support
communities as best as they could.</p>
<p>Ms Low said NRC had tried to explain to the Israeli authorities why
it could not provide them with lists of their Palestinian staff
members.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen that hundreds of aid workers were killed over the last
two years. And so, for us, it is a safety concern for our staff. And
acknowledging who they are - it puts them at risk. Because we’ve seen
that aid workers are just as unprotected, and at times, have been
targeted by Israeli authorities,“ she said.</p>
<p>She also said that the NRC and other INGOs were prevented by data
protection laws from complying with an Israeli demand to share details
about the funding they received from the EU and EU member states.</p>
<p>“The number one thing that we’re concerned about is the entry of
aid,“ she added. “We continue to call for Israel to lift these
restrictions, to open all of the crossings to allow much more aid to
enter than the current rate.“</p>
<p>Israel says it is meeting its obligations in facilitating an increase
in aid deliveries.</p>
<p>On 19 December, UN-backed food security experts said there had been
improvements in nutrition and food supplies in Gaza since the ceasefire
began, but that 100,000 people still experienced “catastrophic
conditions“ last month.</p>
<p>Other INGOs to be suspended include CARE, Medico International, and
Medical Aid for Palestinians.</p>
<p>International Rescue Committee said it was in touch with relevant
authorities and seeking a way to sustain the delivery of life-saving
aid.</p>
<p>Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s policy lead, meanwhile said Cogat’s figures
on aid deliveries by the affected INGOs were misleading because
“humanitarian impact is not measured by percentages“.</p>
<p>“We are not simply aid volume contributors; we are core implementers.
The UN relies on our staff, our partners, our technical expertise, our
logistics, and our community networks to deliver assistance,“ she
explained.</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory -
a forum that brings together UN agencies and more than 200 local and
international NGOs - urged the Israeli authorities to reconsider the
registration decisions.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it complained that the new registration system
relied on “vague, arbitrary, and highly politicised criteria and imposes
requirements that humanitarian organisations cannot meet without
violating international legal obligations or compromising core
humanitarian principles“.</p>
<p>In a statement, Israel’s Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating
Antisemitism, Amichai Chikli, said: “The message is clear: humanitarian
assistance is welcome - the exploitation of humanitarian frameworks for
terrorism is not.“</p>
<p>The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern
Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and
251 others were taken hostage.</p>
<p>More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza
since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry.</p>
