id="年01月01日20时zelensky-says-peace-deal-is-90-ready-in-new-year-address">[2026年01月01日20时]Zelensky
says peace deal is 90% ready in New Year address</h4>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said a peace agreement to
end the war with Russia is “90% ready“, in a New Year address that
largely focused on resistance to Moscow’s full-scale invasion.</p>
<p>Zelensky said the remaining 10% of the agreement to end nearly four
years of conflict would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of
Ukraine and Europe“.</p>
<p>In his own New Year speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his
troops that “we believe in you and our victory“.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Moscow also released what it said was evidence
of Ukraine using drones to target Putin’s private home on Lake Valdai in
north-west Russia, allegations Kyiv has strenuously denied.</p>
<p>It included a map allegedly showing that the drones were launched
from the Sumy and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine and a video of a downed
drone lying in snowy woodland. A serviceman standing next to the
wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone.</p>
<p>The BBC hasn’t been able to verify the footage, and it is not
possible to locate where it was shot.</p>
<p>Russia would review its position on the ongoing peace negotiations as
a result of the alleged incident, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>However, Kaja Kallas, the EU’s top diplomat, on Wednesday described
the Russian claims as a “deliberate distraction“ and an attempt to
derail the peace process.</p>
<p>In his 20-minute address to the nation, Zelensky said that Ukraine
did not want peace “at any cost“, adding that “we want the end of the
war – not the end of Ukraine“.</p>
<p>He said that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the eastern Donbas region
means “everything will be over“, a reference to Russia’s maximalist
demand that Moscow secure full control of the industrial area in any
peace agreement.</p>
<p>Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some
99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively
as Donbas.</p>
<p>Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with
Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full
control of Donbas.</p>
<p>In the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine,
but said that “intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore
- be ratified“.</p>
<p>Following talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump
in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had
offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their
implementation is not yet clear.</p>
<p>“Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,“ Zelensky said in
his address. “Either the world stops Russia’s war, or Russia drags the
world into its war.“</p>
<p>By comparison, Putin’s New Year address was much shorter.</p>
<p>Addressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a “special
military operation“, Putin said: “We strive to bring joy and warmth
through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand
by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in
both word and deed.“</p>
<p>Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message
to praise the “invincible alliance“ between Pyongyang and Moscow, while
praising soldiers who are fighting in “alien lands“.</p>
<p>North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its
invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean
officials have said.</p>
<p>At least 600 of those soldiers have died, according to South Korean
estimates.</p>
<p>Zelensky has expressed a desire for peace negotiations to resume and
accelerate this month with the involvement of both US and European
officials.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said European states and allies who
are due to meet in Paris on 6 January “will make concrete commitments to
protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European
continent“.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Trump’s advisers held talks with Zelensky and national
security advisers from the UK, France and Germany about ending the war
in Ukraine.</p>
<p>US special envoy Steve Witkoff said they discussed “strengthening
security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to
help end the war and ensure it does not restart“.</p>
<p>But any deal will ultimately need Russian buy-in, which does not seem
forthcoming - and which the alleged drone incident over Putin’s
residence may have pushed further into the distance.</p>
