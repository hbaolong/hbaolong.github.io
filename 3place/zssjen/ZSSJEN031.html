Schlossberg essay raises awareness of acute myeloid leukemia</h4>
<p>Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of former US President John F
Kennedy, moved many Americans over the weekend with her emotional essay
about being diagnosed with terminal cancer shortly after giving birth to
her second child.</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>Doctors and researchers say the essay helped raise awareness about
the deadly illness and critical need for more funding and research to
tackle treatment-resistant cancers.</p>
<p>“It’s such an obviously moving and courageous essay,“ said Vijay
Sankaran, a physician with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “She comes from
a very prominent family, and yet anybody can be affected by cancer, even
people who are young, who are seemingly healthy.“</p>
<p>In the essay, titled A Battle With My Blood, Schlossberg said she was
diagnosed after doctors noticed an abnormally high white-blood cell
count after giving birth to her daughter in May 2024.</p>
<p>The daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline
Kennedy, she said she was shocked by the diagnosis, as she considered
herself “one of the healthiest people I knew“.</p>
<p>One of the dangers of acute myeloid leukaemias is that they can
emerge suddenly, going from being undetactable to affecting hundreds of
cells in a matter of days, said Dr Sankaran.</p>
<p>The cancer - affecting both the bone marrow and blood - is rare,
sickening four in 100,000 adults each year.</p>
<p>Schlossberg’s subtype of leukaemia - a chromosomal abnormality
formerly called Inversion 3 - is even rarer, affecting only 1% to 2% of
people with acute myeloid leukaemia.</p>
<p>The rare genetic mutation makes Schlossberg’s cancer even more
dangerous. It is one of the few subsets of acute myeloid leukaemia for
which there are few effective therapies - meaning remissions or cures
“are the minority“, said Courtney DiNardo, professor of leukaemia at
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p>
<p>The most common treatments involve bone marrow transplants,
chemotherapy and clinical trials.</p>
<p>Schlossberg tried them all.</p>
<p>She described in her essay the transplant doctors drained from her
sister’s arms and chemotherapy that made her once “great hair“ fall
out.</p>
<p>She joined a clinical trial for CAR-T-cell therapy, a type of
immunotherapy for certain blood cancers, in which she said scientists
“engineered my sister’s T-cells, directing them to attack my cancer
cells“.</p>
<p>Though the therapy has been revolutionary for other types of
leukaemia, it is less so for acute myeloid leukaemia, Dr Sankaran
said.</p>
<p>In the last clinical trial, her doctor told Schlossberg that he could
“keep me alive for a year, maybe“.</p>
<p>She also discussed battling cancer while watching her cousin, Health
Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, make massive cuts to research funding,
including for cancers. She and other family members are ardent critics
of Kennedy since his unsuccessful presidential campaign and nomination
for the health role.</p>
<p>“As I spent more and more of my life under the care of doctors,
nurses, and researchers striving to improve the lives of others, I
watched as Bobby cut nearly a half billion dollars for research into
mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,“
Schlossberg wrote.</p>
<p>Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic, announced in August that he was pulling
the funding over claims that “mRNA technology poses more risks than
benefits“ for certain respiratory viruses. He also revoked funding for
hundreds of research grants through the National Institutes of Health
(NIH).</p>
<p>Even though cuts to mRNA funding were only for respiratory viruses,
they have had a chilling effect in the entire mRNA research community,
said Jeff Coller, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins
University focused on RNA therapeutics.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen that researchers are, quite frankly, afraid to put
together proposals for clinical trials that would be using mRNAs. And we
call these cancer vaccines,“ he said.</p>
<p>The NIH was once a global leader in funding for biomedical research,
but that has changed this year, Dr Sankaran said.</p>
<p>“That’s been limiting, because you could just imagine you need to
take more shots on goal to actually have research that will successfully
lead to therapies,“ he said.</p>
<p>Schlossberg’s battle - while having access to the best care as a
member of a prominent American family - highlights the need for more
funding to develop better screening tools and treatments for all
patients, physicians said.</p>
<p>“[Schlossberg] continues to have a poor prognosis with even the best
available tools that we have, and so I think it just really emphasizes
our need to do better for many of our patients,“ Dr Sankaran said.</p>
