white sharks face extinction in Mediterranean, say researchers</h4>
<p>Great white sharks in the Mediterranean Sea are in danger of
disappearing, with illegal fishing contributing to their decline.</p>
<p>This is according to research by US scientists, working in
partnership with UK charity Blue Marine Foundation. They say some of the
most threatened species - including great white sharks - are being sold
in North African fish markets.</p>
<p>Great whites are one of more than 20 Mediterranean shark species
protected under international law, meaning it is illegal to fish for
them or to sell them.</p>
<p>By monitoring fishing ports on the Mediterranean coast of North
Africa, however, researchers discovered that at least 40 great white
sharks have been killed there in 2025 alone.</p>
<p>The BBC has also found, and independently verified, footage from
social media of protected sharks being brought dead into North African
ports.</p>
<p>One video showed a large great white being hauled ashore from a
fishing boat in Algeria. Another, filmed in Tunisia, shows heads and
fins of what appears to be a short-finned mako shark, which is also a
threatened and protected species, being prepared for sale.</p>
<p>Lead researcher, Dr Francesco Ferretti from the US university
Virginia Tech, explained that many shark populations - white sharks in
particular - had declined dramatically in the Mediterranean in recent
decades.</p>
<p>“No other stretch of water is fished like the Mediterranean Sea,“ he
said, speaking to the BBC News science team while working on a research
vessel off the coast of Sicily in late 2025.</p>
<p>“The impact of industrial fishing has been intensifying… and it’s
plausible that they will go extinct in the near future.“</p>
<p>The Mediterranean white shark population is now classified as
Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature.</p>
<p>In their latest attempt to find and study the predators, Dr Ferretti
and his team worked in the Strait of Sicily - an area between Sicily and
North Africa that has been identified as a “last stronghold“ in the
Mediterranean for several threatened shark species.</p>
<p>One key aim of their mission was to fit a satellite tracking tag onto
a white shark - something that has never been done in the Mediterranean
Sea.</p>
<p>To attempt this, the researchers brought more than three tonnes of
fish bait - a shipping container packed with frozen mackerel and tuna
scraps, as well as 500 litres of tuna oil to create a “fat slick“ that
many sharks would be able to smell from hundreds of metres away.</p>
<p>Despite working for two weeks - baiting the ocean, taking samples of
seawater to search for shark DNA and using underwater cameras - the
researchers did not manage to find any animals to tag.</p>
<p>They captured only a brief glimpse of one blue shark on their
submarine cameras.</p>
<p>“It’s disheartening,“ Dr Ferretti told us. “It just shows how
degraded this ecosystem is.“</p>
<p>While the team was searching for surviving sharks, they also received
reports that a juvenile great white had been caught and killed in a
North African fishery - just 20 nautical miles from where they were
working.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether that animal was accidentally caught in
fishing gear, or if it was targeted.</p>
<p>Dr Ferretti and his team, though, estimate that more than 40 great
white sharks have been caught around that coast. “This is a lot for a
critically endangered population,“ he said.</p>
<p>The researchers, with their colleagues in North Africa are monitoring
several fishing ports in the region. Our work, with the BBC Forensics
team, also shows that protected sharks are caught, landed and offered
for sale in countries including Tunisia and Algeria.</p>
<p>We found footage - posted on social media - of a great white being
landed in a fishing port in Algeria and another large shark that appears
to be a protected short-finned mako, being prepared for sale on a trolly
in a fish market in Tunisia.</p>
<p>The rules that protect sharks are complicated. Currently, 24
threatened species have international legal protection – including mako,
angel, threshers and hammerheads.</p>
<p>The EU and 23 nations around the Mediterranean have signed an
agreement, which states that those species cannot be “retained on board,
transhipped, landed, transferred, stored, sold or displayed or offered
for sale“.</p>
<p>The international agreement states “they must be released unharmed
and alive [where] possible“. Those rules do not tackle accidental
bycatch and enforcement is variable from country to country.</p>
<p>James Glancy from Blue Marine told BBC News that his own
investigation found multiple white sharks on sale in Tunisian fishing
markets. But, he said, there was a paradoxical element of hope in the
fact that white sharks were turning up for sale.</p>
<p>“It shows that there is wildlife left,“ he told BBC News. “And if we
can preserve this, there is a chance of recovery.“</p>
<p>In poorer communities in North Africa, fishers who catch sharks might
face the choice of whether to feed their family, or return a threatened
species to the ocean.</p>
<p>Sara Almabruk from the Libyan Marine Biology Society says that most
of the catches happening in North African waters are accidental, but
adds: “Why would they throw sharks back into the sea when they need food
for their children?</p>
<p>“If you support them and train them in more sustainable fishing, they
will not catch white sharks – or any sharks.“</p>
<p>James Glancy from Blue Marine added that if countries around the
Mediterranean worked together, “there is hope.</p>
<p>“But, he added, “we’ve got to act very quickly“.</p>
