Marjorie Taylor Greene went from Trump ally to quitting Congress</h4>
<p>Marjorie Taylor Greene came into Congress as one of Donald Trump’s
staunchest defenders.</p>
<p>Sworn into office just days before the 6 January 2021 attack on the
US Capitol, Greene supported the president - and echoed his contention
that the 2020 presidential election was “stolen“ - when many in the
Republican Party disavowed him.</p>
<p>Now, five years later, Greene will leave Congress having been branded
a “traitor“ by the man she once revered.</p>
<p>Over the course of just a handful of months, Greene broke with Trump
in the most dramatic fashion.</p>
<p>Although Greene had criticised Trump’s decision to launch airstrikes
on Iran, his support for Israel during the Gaza War and a lack of
sufficient regulation of big technology companies earlier this year,</p>
<p>She condemned Trump’s unwillingness to order his justice department
to fully release its files on the case, and appeared alongside Epstein’s
victims – and Democrats - to force a House vote on the matter.</p>
<p>It didn’t end there, however.</p>
<p>Greene would also question Republican strategy during the recent
government shutdown, siding with Democrats in calling on her party to
address expiring healthcare subsidies for low-income Americans.</p>
<p>She publicly berated Trump for what she said was an undue emphasis on
foreign policy at the expense of addressing economic and affordability
concerns.</p>
<p>“The American people aren’t motivated by foreign wars or bailouts for
other countries,“ she wrote on X earlier this month. “They want leaders
who show up, do the job, and fight for them every single day!“</p>
<p>Greene continued to insist that she supported Trump, but it became
increasingly clear that she has a view of the “America First“ movement
that differs from the US president’s.</p>
<p>An activist turned congresswoman who made her name railing against
the political establishment had now found that the Maga – “Make America
Great Again“ - movement she supported had become the establishment.</p>
<p>And as the weight of Trump’s power focused on her ouster – she</p>
<p>“I refuse to be a ‘battered wife’ hoping it all goes away and gets
better,“ she said in her resignation statement.</p>
<p>“If I am cast aside by Maga Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma,
Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the
elite donor class that can’t even relate to real Americans, then many
common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.“</p>
<p>Throughout her career, she often embraced controversy and leaned into
conflict.</p>
<p>A gym instructor in Georgia, she began engaging in politics in 2016,
as Trump started his successful campaign for the White House. She made
frequent trips to Washington DC, where she would berate Democratic
members of Congress for what she said were their socialist and pro-Islam
policies.</p>
<p>She promoted baseless QAnon conspiracy theories, questioning whether
shootings in a US school were “staged“ and alleging that the Democratic
party was secretly run by a group of powerful paedophiles.</p>
<p>Once in Congress, she clashed with Democrats - and members of her own
party. Although she renounced some of her past conspiratorial views, the
House voted to</p>
<p>When Republicans returned to power in Congress she had a political
rehabilitation of sorts, working with then Speaker of the House Kevin
McCarthy to consolidate conservative support in the chamber. When
McCarthy was ousted, Greene fought with his replacement, Mike Johnson,
and launched an unsuccessful bid to remove him as well.</p>
<p>In 2023, she was expelled from the conservative House Freedom
Caucus.</p>
<p>She had become a political wildcard – still despised by many on the
left but also viewed with suspicion by conservatives. She still had
close ties with Trump, which gave her influence in Washington.</p>
<p>And then she didn’t.</p>
<p>In a brief interview on Friday night, Trump told ABC News that
Greene’s departure from Congress was “great news for the country“.</p>
<p>He would later post on Truth Social that Greene “went bad“ but that
he would “always appreciate Marjorie and thank her for her service to
our country“.</p>
<p>Greene said she will return to her home in Georgia and a “new path
ahead“. Although she had reportedly expressed interest in the state’s
governor race next year, she recently said she would not seek that
office – or seek to unseat incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff.</p>
<p>Her decision to resign effective 5 January, however, leaves open the
possibility that she could change her mind and run for office in a state
where Republican politicians, like the current Georgia governor Brian
Kemp, have shown that it is possible to win elections even without
Trump’s support.</p>
<p>The move also allows Greene to reposition herself politically, as the
Republican Party begins grappling with an environment where public
support for Trump - particularly his handling of the economy - appears
to be souring and the president, limited by the constitution, will never
appear on a presidential ballot again.</p>
<p>At 51, Greene’s tenure in Congress may be at an end, but her
involvement in American political life may be far from over.</p>
