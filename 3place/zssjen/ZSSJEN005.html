<h4 id="how-to-fix-your-entire-life-in-1-day">How to fix your entire
life in 1 day</h4>
<p>If you’re anything like me, you think new years resolutions are
stupid.</p>
<p>Because most people go about changing their lives in the completely
wrong way. They create these resolutions because everyone else does – we
create a superficial meaning out of status games – but they don’t meet
the requirements for true change, which goes a lot deeper than
convincing yourself you’re going to be more disciplined or productive
this year.</p>
<p>If you’re one of these people, I’m not here to talk down on you (I
tend to be a bit harsh in my writing). I’ve quit 10x more goals than
I’ve achieved. I think that should be the case for most people. But the
fact that people try to change their lives and utterly fail almost every
time holds true.</p>
<p>However, as much as I think new years resolutions are stupid, it’s
always wise to reflect on the life you hate so you can launch yourself
toward something that much better, as we will discuss.</p>
<p>So whether you want to start the business, transform your body, or
take the risk toward a more meaningful life without quitting after 2
weeks, I want to share 7 ideas you probably haven’t heard before on
behavior change, psychology, and productivity so you can do just that in
2026.</p>
<p>This will be comprehensive.</p>
<p>This isn’t one of those letters that you read through and forget
about.</p>
<p>This is something you will want to bookmark, take notes on, and set
aside time to think about.</p>
<p>The protocol at the end (to dig deep into your psyche and uncover
what you truly want in life) will take about a full day to complete,
with effects that last far longer than that.</p>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>
<p>I – You aren’t where you want to be because you aren’t the person who
would be there</p>
<p>When it comes to setting big goals, people tend to focus on one of
the two requirements for success:</p>
<p>Changing your actions to make progress toward the goal (least
important, second order)</p>
<p>Changing who you are so that your behavior naturally follows (most
important, first order)</p>
<p>Most people set a surface-level goal, hype themselves up to remain
disciplined for the first few weeks, then go back to their old ways
without much struggle, because they were trying to build a great life on
a rotting foundation.</p>
<p>If this doesn’t make sense, let’s run through an example.</p>
<p>Think of somebody successful. It can be a bodybuilder with a great
physique, a founder/CEO worth hundreds of millions, or a charismatic
dude who can chat up a group without a shred of anxiety entering his
mind.</p>
<p>Do you think the bodybuilder has to “grind” to eat healthy? Does the
CEO have to discipline themselves to show up and lead the team? To you,
it may seem like that on the surface, but the truth is that they can’t
see themselves living any other way. The bodybuilder has to grind to eat
unhealthily. The CEO has to force themself to lie in bed past their
alarm clock, and they hate every second of it (there is nuance here,
just entertain me for a second).</p>
<p>To some people, my own lifestyle seems a bit extreme and disciplined.
To me, it’s natural, and I don’t say that to contrast it with any other
kind of lifestyle. I simply enjoy living this way. When my mom tells me
that I should take a break, go out, and have some fun… I hold my tongue
from telling her, “If I weren’t having fun, why would I be doing what
I’m doing?”</p>
<p>This next sentence may sound simple, but it is baffling how many
people don’t get it.</p>
<p>If you want a specific outcome in life, you must have the lifestyle
that creates that outcome long before you reach it.</p>
<p>If someone says they want to lose 30 pounds, I often don’t believe
them. Not because I don’t think they are capable, but because there are
too many times when that same person says, “I can’t wait until I’m done
losing weight so I can start to enjoy life again.” I hate to break it to
you, but if you don’t adopt the lifestyle that led to you losing the
weight, for life, and find a reason with a higher gravitational pull
than the one tying you to your previous ways, then you will go straight
back to where you started, and you can unhappily say that you wasted the
resource you will never get back: time.</p>
<p>When you truly change yourself, all of your habits that don’t move
the needle toward your goal become disgusting, because you have a deep
and profound awareness of what kind of life those actions compound into.
You are okay with your current standards because you are not fully aware
of what they are or what they lead to. We will discuss how to uncover
this, but we need to build up to that.</p>
<p>You say you want to change. You say you want to “become financially
free” and “get healthy,” but your actions show otherwise for a reason.
And it goes a lot deeper than you think.</p>
<p>II – You aren’t where you want to be because you don’t want to be
there</p>
<p>Trust only movement. Life happens at the level of events, not of
words. Trust movement.</p>
<p>– Alfred Adler</p>
<p>If you want to change who you are, you must understand how the mind
works so that you can start to reprogram it.</p>
<p>The first step to understanding the mind is to understand that all
behavior is goal-oriented. It’s teleological. When you think about it,
this is kinda obvious, but when we dig into it, most people don’t want
to hear it.</p>
<p>You take a step forward because you want to reach a certain
location.</p>
<p>You scratch your nose because you want to make the itch go away.</p>
<p>Those ones are clear, but most of the time, your goals are
unconscious. You may not realize that when you sit on the couch in the
middle of the day, you are trying to burn time before your next
responsibility, as one simple example.</p>
<p>On an even more unconscious and complex level, you pursue goals that
can harm you, but you justify your actions in a way that is socially
acceptable and doesn’t make you seem like a loser.</p>
<p>As an example, if you can’t stop procrastinating your work, you may
justify it with the fact that you “lack discipline,” but in reality, you
are attempting to achieve a goal like you always are. In this case, that
goal could be to protect yourself from the judgment that comes from
finishing and sharing your work.</p>
<p>If you say you want to quit your dead-end job, but stay in it without
any real reason, you may start to think you don’t have enough courage,
or that you were never really a “risk taker,” but the truth is that you
are pursuing the goal of safety, predictability, and an excuse to not
look like a failure to everyone else in your life who sees working a
dead-end job as a sign of success.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that real change requires changing your goals.</p>
<p>I don’t mean setting some surface-level goal because the act of doing
that serves an unconscious goal that is actually harming you. That’s
been ran through enough in the productivity space. I mean changing your
point of view. Because that’s what a goal is. A goal is a projection
into the future that acts as a lens of perception which allows you to
notice information, ideas, and resources that aid in you achieving that
goal.</p>
<p>Now let’s dig a bit deeper, because if you don’t understand this, it
only becomes more difficult to get out.</p>
<p>I send out letters like these 1-2x a week. If you don’t want to miss
them, join here. You can also read my book free, other letters, etc.</p>
<p>III – You aren’t where you want to be because you’re afraid to be
there</p>
<p>The important thing for you to remember is that it does not matter in
the least how you got the idea or where it came from. You may never have
met a professional hypnotist. You may never have been formally
hypnotized. But if you have accepted an idea - from yourself, your
teachers, your parents, friends, advertisements, from any other source -
and further, if you are firmly convinced that idea is true, it has the
same power over you as the hypnotist’s words have over the hypnotized
subject.</p>
<p>– Maxwell Maltz</p>
<p>Here’s how you’ve become who you are today, and how you will become
who you will be tomorrow. This is the anatomy of identity:</p>
<p>You want to achieve a goal</p>
<p>You perceive reality through the lens of that goal</p>
<p>You only notice “important” information and ideas that allows you to
achieve that goal (learning)</p>
<p>You act toward that goal and receive feedback that you are
progressing toward it</p>
<p>You repeat that behavior until it becomes automatic and unconscious
(conditioning)</p>
<p>That behavior becomes a part of who you think you are (”I am the type
of person who…”)</p>
<p>You defend your identity to maintain psychological consistency</p>
<p>Your identity shapes new goals, restarting the cycle, and if that
identity is disadvantageous toward a good life, this gets bad very
quick</p>
<p>The unfortunate reality is that you must break the cycle between
steps 6 and 7, but this process starts when you are a child.</p>
<p>You have the goal of survival.</p>
<p>You are dependent on your parents to teach you how to survive. You
had to conform. And since the way most people teach is through reward
and punishment, unless you adopt their beliefs and values, you will be
punished. You don’t actually think for yourself until you see through
this.</p>
<p>But your parents have also gone through this process throughout their
entire lives. That’s where it can get dangerous. Your parents, unless
they broke the pattern themselves, were conditioned by the culturally
accepted ideas of success from the Industrial age. They also carry the
best and worst conditioning from their parents and their parents’
parents.</p>
<p>To take it a layer deeper, once you fulfill your physical survival
needs (which is quite easy to do in today’s world, you’re practically
born into safety), you start to survive on the conceptual or ideological
level. You may not try to protect and reproduce your body, but you
absolutely protect and reproduce your mind. It’s not difficult to see
the war of ideas on the internet, and the participants are individual
and group identities.</p>
<p>When your body feels threatened, you go into fight or flight.</p>
<p>When your identity feels threatened, the same thing happens.</p>
<p>If you are heavily identified with a political ideology (by the
process we talked about just before), you will feel threatened when
someone challenges your beliefs. You literally feel the stress. You
feel, emotionally, like you were just slapped in the face. Since most
people don’t analyze their emotions for truth, you tend to get stuck in
echo chambers and double down on claims that harm yourself and
others.</p>
<p>If you were raised in a religious household, and did not think for
yourself, you will fight and attack others who threaten your
psychological safety within that little bubble.</p>
<p>The same thing happens when you unconsciously see yourself as a
lawyer, a gamer, or somebody else who would not take the actions to
achieve a better life.</p>
<p>IV – The life you want lies within a specific level of mind</p>
<p>The mind evolves through predictable stages over time.</p>
<p>When you’re born, you’re like a little survival sponge that absorbs
whatever beliefs you can (which are heavily dictated by your culture) so
that you can feel safe and secure. And if you don’t be careful, your
mind may crystalize and it may make it difficult to live a meaningful
life.</p>
<p>This has been documented enough in models like Maslow’s Hierarchy,
Greuter’s stages of ego development, Spiral Dynamics, and Integral
Theory, each building off of one another, but it’s also not difficult to
observe in society.</p>
<p>I’ve talked about these many times, and synthesized them into my own
Human 3.0 model with various AI prompts to uncover your level of
development and a path forward (open in a tab to read after if you’d
like), but here’s the 80/20 of the 9 stages of ego development as a
refresher (because repetition helps reveal things you didn’t notice
before, and there are new people reading these letters):</p>
<p>Impulsive — No separation between impulse and action. Black and white
thinking. I.e. A toddler hits when angry because the feeling and the
behavior are the same thing.</p>
<p>Self-Protective — The world is dangerous and you learn to look out
for yourself. I.e. A kid learns to hide report cards, lie about chores,
and figure out what adults want to hear.</p>
<p>Conformist — You are your group and its rules feel like reality
itself. I.e. Someone who genuinely cannot fathom why anyone would vote
differently than their family or group.</p>
<p>Self-Aware — You notice you have an inner life that doesn’t match the
exterior. I.e. Sitting in church and realizing you’re not sure you
believe what everyone around you seems to believe, but not knowing what
to do with that feeling yet.</p>
<p>Conscientious — You build your own system of principles and hold
yourself accountable to them. I.e. Leaving your family’s religion after
careful study and adopting a personal philosophy you can defend, or
building a career plan with clear milestones because you believe the
right effort yields the right results.</p>
<p>Individualist — You see that your principles were shaped by context
and start holding them more loosely. I.e. Realizing your political views
have more to do with where you grew up than objective truth, or noticing
that your ambitious career goals were really about earning your father’s
approval.</p>
<p>Strategist — You work with systems while aware of your own
involvement in them. I.e. Leading an organization while actively
questioning your own blind spots, or engaging in politics knowing your
perspective is partial and shaped by bias you can’t fully see.</p>
<p>Construct-Aware — You see all frameworks, including your identity, as
useful fictions. I.e. Holding your spiritual beliefs with metaphorically
not literally, knowing the map is not the territory, or watching
yourself play the role of “founder” or “thought leader” with a kind of
gentle amusement.</p>
<p>Unitive — Separation between self and life dissolves. I.e. Work,
rest, and play feel like the same thing. There’s no one left who needs
to become something, just presence responding to what arises.</p>
<p>For most people reading this, I would assume you hover between 4 and
8, which is a huge gap. Those closer to 8 are reading this are doing so
to either learn something or pass time in a non-destructive way. Those
closer to 4 are really looking for a change. You feel like you are meant
for more, but you can’t make sense of everything yet, because there’s
obviously a lot at play.</p>
<p>The good thing is, it doesn’t really matter what stage you are in,
because moving through any of them follows a pattern.</p>
<p>V – Intelligence is the ability to get what you want out of life</p>
<p>The only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of
life.</p>
<p>– Naval Ravikant</p>
<p>There is a formula for success.</p>
<p>One ingredient is agency.</p>
<p>One ingredient is opportunity (which many people like to mistake as
“privilege” - because they the other ingredients).</p>
<p>The last ingredient is intelligence.</p>
<p>If you have high agency but low opportunity, it doesn’t matter how
likely you are to act toward a goal, because it isn’t a goal that will
bear much fruit.</p>
<p>If you have opportunity and agency but low intelligence, then you
will never be fully able to benefit from that opportunity.</p>
<p>First, we’ve talked about agency before here. In terms of
opportunity, I can’t tell you to change your physical location, but if
you don’t see the abundance of digital opportunity right in front of
you, I don’t know what to tell you.</p>
<p>With that said, I want to focus on what intelligence is in the
context of these two other ingredients and this letter. For that, we
look to cybernetics.</p>
<p>Cybernetics comes from the greek word kybernetikos which means “to
steer” or “good at steering.”</p>
<p>It’s also known as “the art of getting what you want.”</p>
<p>So, if Naval’s definition of intelligence is getting what you want
out of life, understanding cybernetics helps you do that much
faster.</p>
<p>Cybernetics illustrates the properties of intelligent systems.</p>
<p>To have a goal.</p>
<p>Act toward that goal.</p>
<p>Sense where you are.</p>
<p>Compare it to the goal.</p>
<p>And act again based on that feedback.</p>
<p>You can judge intelligence based on the system’s ability to iterate
and persist with trial and error.</p>
<p>A ship blown off course that corrects toward its destination. A
thermostat sensing a change in heat and turning on. The pancreas
excreting insulin after blood glucose spikes.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with getting what you want out of life?</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Acting, sensing, comparing, and understanding the system from a
meta-perspective is fundamental to high intelligence (with the
definition we are using here).</p>
<p>High intelligence is the ability to iterate, persist, and understand
the big picture. The mark of low intelligence is the inability to learn
from your mistakes.</p>
<p>Low-intelligence people get stuck on problems rather than solving
them. They hit a roadblock and quit. Like a writer who fails to build a
readership and quits because they lack the ability to try new things,
experiment, and figure out a process that works for them (to think that
there isn’t an effective process you can create is verifiably false, no
matter your limiting beliefs, hence being low intelligence.)</p>
<p>High intelligence is realizing any problem can be solved on a large
enough timescale. The reality is that you can achieve any goal you set
your mind to.</p>
<p>Intelligence is realizing that there is a series of choices you can
make which lead to achieving the goal you want. You understand that
ideas are hierarchical and that you can’t go from papyrus to Google docs
in one fell swoop. Even if that goal is impossible right now, you simply
don’t have the resources – which may be invented over the next few years
– to achieve that thing.</p>
<p>When I talk about “goals,” and as I will continue repeating, I am not
speaking from the typical lens of self-help, although that’s a helpful
lens to adopt at times.</p>
<p>I am speaking from the lens of teleology or the Greek kosmos – that
everything serves a purpose. That everything is a part of a greater
whole.</p>
<p>Goals determine how you see the world.</p>
<p>Goals determine what you consider “success” or “failure.”</p>
<p>You can try to “enjoy the journey,” but if you pursue the wrong goal,
you will not enjoy it.</p>
<p>Your mind is the operating system for reality.</p>
<p>That system is composed of goals.</p>
<p>For most people, those goals are assigned to them. Programmed like
lines of code in your psyche.</p>
<p>Go to school. Get the job. Get offended. Play victim. Retire at
65.</p>
<p>A known path that doesn’t work.</p>
<p>To become more intelligent, you must:</p>
<p>Reject the known path</p>
<p>Dive into the unknown</p>
<p>Set new, higher goals to expand your mind</p>
<p>Embrace the chaos and allow for growth</p>
<p>Study the generalized principles of nature</p>
<p>Become a deep generalist</p>
<p>I understand this may not be the traditional definition of
intelligence, but that sequence of steps leads to an extraordinary level
of connections in your brain, leading to what we would observe as an
intelligent person. Pair that with agency and you’ve got a winner.</p>
<p>That leads us into the next section perfectly.</p>
<p>VI – How to launch into a completely new life (in 1 day)</p>
<p>The best periods of my life always came after a period of getting
absolutely fed up with the lack of progress I was making.</p>
<p>How do you dig into your mind?</p>
<p>How do you become aware of your conditioning?</p>
<p>How do you reach profound insights and truths that change the
trajectory of your life?</p>
<p>Through the simple, but often painful act of questioning.</p>
<p>Something that so few people do, and you can tell by how they speak
or give their thoughts on a specific topic. Questioning is thinking, and
very few people do it.</p>
<p>I want to give you a comprehensive protocol that you can use every
year to reset your life and launch into a season of intense progress.
This protocol helps you ask the right questions.</p>
<p>These questions will cover the macro to the micro: where you want to
be, what you need to do to get there, and what you can do immediately to
start moving the needle toward that reality.</p>
<p>This will require one full day to complete, so I recommend you follow
along with the exact protocol. You will need a pen, paper, and an open
mind.</p>
<p>When I observe patterns in people who successfully flip their
identity, it happens fast after a build up of tension. Specifically,
I’ve noticed 3 phases that people tend to go through.</p>
<p>Dissonance – They feel like they don’t belong in their current life,
and become sufficiently fed up with their lack of progress.</p>
<p>Uncertainty – They don’t know what comes next, so they either
experiment or get lost and feel worse.</p>
<p>Discovery – They discover what they want to pursue and make 6 years
of progress in 6 months.</p>
<p>So, our goal with this protocol is to help you reach the point of
dissonance, navigate through uncertainty, and discover what it truly is
that you want to achieve, so much so that the clarity is overwhelming
and distractions no longer hold their weight.</p>
<p>This protocol is structured so that it can be completed in one day.
In the morning, you do a psychological excavation to uncover your own
hidden motives. During the day, you prompt yourself with interrupts to
keep you out of autopilot and contemplate your life. At night, you
synthesize the insights into a direction you will start to move in
tomorrow.</p>
<p>I cannot guarantee that this will work for everyone, because I cannot
guarantee that everyone reading this is in the right chapter of their
own story that would make these points impactful. You can’t place the
climax at the start of the book and expect it to be interesting.</p>
<p>Part 1) Morning – Psychological Excavation – Vision andandandand
Anti-Vision</p>
<p>First we must create a new frame, or lens of perception, for your
mind to operate from.</p>
<p>This is like creating a new shell, leaving your old one, and slowly
growing into it over time. It won’t feel like it fits at first. That’s a
good thing.</p>
<p>Set aside 15-30 minutes (the length of one YouTube video… you can do
it) to think about and answer these questions. Do not attempt to
outsource this contemplation to AI. I want you to break past the limiter
that is on your mind. If you can’t answer these immediately, come back
to them later.</p>
<p>What is the dull and persistent dissatisfaction you’ve learned to
live with? Not the deep suffering but what you’ve learned to tolerate.
(If you don’t hate it, you will tolerate it)</p>
<p>What do you complain about repeatedly but never actually change?
Write down the three complaints you’ve voiced most often in the past
year.</p>
<p>For each complaint: What would someone who watched your behavior (not
your words) conclude that you actually want?</p>
<p>What truth about your current life would be unbearable to admit to
someone you deeply respect?</p>
<p>Those questions are meant to make you aware of the pain in your
current life. Now, we need to turn those into what I call an
“anti-vision,” which is a brutal awareness of the life you do not want
to live. That way, you can use that negative energy to aim your efforts
in a positive direction and act from a place of intrinsic
motivation.</p>
<p>If absolutely nothing changes for the next five years, describe an
average Tuesday. Where do you wake up? What does your body feel like?
What’s the first thing you think about? Who’s around you? What do you do
between 9am and 6pm? How do you feel at 10pm?</p>
<p>Now do it but for ten years. What have you missed? What opportunities
closed? Who gave up on you? What do people say about you when you’re not
in the room?</p>
<p>You’re at the end of your life. You lived the safe version. You never
broke the pattern. What was the cost? What did you never let yourself
feel, try, or become?</p>
<p>Who in your life is already living the future you just described?
Someone five, ten, twenty years ahead on the same trajectory? What do
you feel when you think about becoming them?</p>
<p>What identity would you have to give up to actually change? (”I am
the type of person who…”) What would it cost you socially to no longer
be that person?</p>
<p>What is the most embarrassing reason you haven’t changed? The one
that makes you sound weak, scared, or lazy rather than reasonable?</p>
<p>If your current behavior is a form of self-protection, what exactly
are you protecting? And what is that protection costing you?</p>
<p>If you answered those truthfully, and if you are in the right chapter
of your life, you will feel a deep sense of dis-ease and possibly
disgust for how you are currently living. Now, we need to orient that
energy in a positive direction. We need to create a minimum viable
vision, because your vision is like a product. It starts out unclear,
but with time and experience, it grows stronger and more potent.</p>
<p>Forget practicality for a minute. If you could snap your fingers and
be living a different life in three years, not what’s realistic, what
you actually want? What does an average Tuesday look like? Same level of
detail as question 5.</p>
<p>What would you have to believe about yourself for that life to feel
natural rather than forced? Write the identity statement: “I am the type
of person who…”</p>
<p>What is one thing you would do this week if you were already that
person?</p>
<p>Answer all of those first thing in the morning tomorrow.</p>
<p>Part 2) Throughout The Day – Interrupting Autopilot – Breaking
Unconscious Patterns</p>
<p>These journaling exercises are cute, but we want real change.</p>
<p>Frankly, that’s not going to happen if you don’t break the current
unconscious patterns that are keeping you the same.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, I want you to contemplate on everything you
journaled in part one. Beyond that, I don’t want you to forget to
contemplate. Please take this seriously. You aren’t going to change by
doing the same thing for the rest of your life. You need to consciously
force a pattern break.</p>
<p>Take the time right now to create reminders or calendar events in
your phone. Include the question in the reminder or event so that you
can immediately start thinking about it.</p>
<p>The more random and non-conflicting with your schedule there are, the
better.</p>
<p>11:00am: What am I avoiding right now by doing what I’m doing?</p>
<p>1:30pm: If someone filmed the last two hours, what would they
conclude I want from my life?</p>
<p>3:15pm: Am I moving toward the life I hate or the life I want?</p>
<p>5:00pm: What’s the most important thing I’m pretending isn’t
important?</p>
<p>7:30pm: What did I do today out of identity protection rather than
genuine desire? (Hint: it’s most things you do)</p>
<p>9:00pm: When did I feel most alive today? When did I feel most
dead?</p>
<p>To add a bit more fuel to the fire, schedule these questions during
times where you are either commuting, walking, or lying around.</p>
<p>What would change if I stopped needing people to see me as [the
identity you wrote in question 10]?</p>
<p>Where in my life am I trading aliveness for safety?</p>
<p>What’s the smallest version of the person I want to become that I
could be tomorrow?</p>
<p>Part 3) Evening – Synthesizing Insight – Entering A Season Of
Progress</p>
<p>If you followed that process, I would be surprised if you didn’t have
at least one profound insight that could alter the course of your life.
Now, we need to make those known, integrate them into who we are, and
act on them to begin solidifying our journey to a new level of mind.</p>
<p>After today, what feels most true about why you’ve been stuck?</p>
<p>What is the actual enemy? Name it clearly. Not circumstances. Not
other people. The internal pattern or belief that has been running the
show.</p>
<p>Write a single sentence that captures what you refuse to let your
life become. This is your anti-vision compressed. It should make you
feel something when you read it.</p>
<p>Write a single sentence that captures what you’re building toward,
knowing it will evolve. This is your vision MVP.</p>
<p>Lastly, we need to create goals.</p>
<p>Again, these aren’t goals that you set for the sake of achievement,
because goals are just projections. They are unreliable and make you
feel bound to something that will inevitably change. Instead, think of
goals as a point of view. A lens that you can exchange to enter the
right state of mind to perform the action that will lead away from the
life you don’t want. Do not worry about some kind of finish line,
because as we will find, it doesn’t exist. Enjoyment is found in
progress.</p>
<p>One-year lens: What would have to be true in one year for you to know
you’ve broken the old pattern? One concrete thing.</p>
<p>One-month lens: What would have to be true in one month for the
one-year lens to remain possible?</p>
<p>Daily lens: What are 2-3 actions you can timeblock tomorrow that the
person you’re becoming would simply do?</p>
<p>That was a lot.</p>
<p>Hopefully it was helpful.</p>
<p>But we have one last piece to lock it all in.</p>
<p>Stick with me.</p>
<p>VII – Turn Your Life Into A Video Game</p>
<p>The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order
in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy—or attention—is
invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for
action. The pursuit of a goal brings order in awareness because a person
must concentrate attention on the task at hand and momentarily forget
everything else.</p>
<p>– Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</p>
<p>You now have all of the components that lead to a good life.</p>
<p>Now, it may be helpful to organize all of your insights into one
coherent plan. Pull out a new page and write down these 6
components:</p>
<p>Anti-vision – What is the bane of my existence, or the life I never
want to experience again?</p>
<p>Vision – What is the ideal life that I think I want and can improve
as I work toward it?</p>
<p>1 year goal – What will my life look like in 1 year time, and is that
closer to the life I want?</p>
<p>1 month project – What do I need to learn? What skills do I need to
acquire? What can I build that will move me closer to the one year
goal?</p>
<p>Daily levers – What are the priority, needle-moving tasks that bring
my project closer to completion?</p>
<p>Constraints – What am I not willing to sacrifice to achieve my vision
from the ground up?</p>
<p>Why is this so powerful?</p>
<p>Because these components literally create your own little world. If
you are meant to pursue this hierarchy of goals at this stage of your
life, you will have no other option but to become obsessed. You will
feel the pull to something greater. You will not see anything else as an
option.</p>
<p>You turn your life into a video game.</p>
<p>Because games are the poster child for obsession, enjoyment, and flow
states. They have all the components that lead to focus and clarity, so
if we reverse engineer what those components are, we can live in a state
of deeper enjoyment, less distractions, and more success.</p>
<p>Your vision is how you win. At least until the game evolves.</p>
<p>Your anti-vision is what’s at stake. What happens if you lose or give
up.</p>
<p>Your 1 year goal is the mission. This is your sole priority in
life.</p>
<p>Your 1 month project is the boss fight. How you gain XP and acquire
loot.</p>
<p>Your daily levers are the quests. The daily process that unlocks new
opportunities.</p>
<p>Your constraints are the rules. The limitations that encourage
creativity.</p>
<p>All of these act as a concentric set of circles, like a forcefield,
that guard your mind from distractions and shiny objects.</p>
<p>The more you play the game, the stronger this force becomes, and soon
enough it becomes who you are, and you wouldn’t have it any other
way.</p>
