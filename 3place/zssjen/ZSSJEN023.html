records suggest ICE agent in Minnesota shooting was dragged by car in
June</h4>

<li>minnesota,英 [ˌmɪnɪˈsəʊtə] 美 [ˌmɪnɪˈsoʊtə]
n. 明尼苏达州（美国中北部洲）</li>
</ul>
<p>US court records have offered leads to the identity of the
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent who shot and killed
37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday.</p>
<ul>
<li>ICE,Immigration and Customs
Enforcement，移民和海关执法局：美国联邦政府的一个机构，负责执行移民和海关法律，以保护美国的国土安全。</li>
</ul>
<p>Federal officials have not publicly named the agent, but said he was
injured in another case in June, when he was dragged by a car that
pulled away during an investigation.</p>
<ul>
<li>federal,英 [ˈfedərəl] 美 [ˈfedərəl] adj.
联邦（制）的；（与）联邦政府（有关的）的；中央集权式的；（美国内战时期）北部联邦政府的
n. 联邦探员，联邦政府官员；（美国南北战争时期）北部联邦政府支持者</li>
</ul>
<p>In court records from a case with details matching that incident, an
agent named Jonathan Ross suffered a “substantial wound“ on his arm and
needed more than 50 stitches, along with abrasions to his knee, elbow
and face.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s shooting has roiled the US, with people divided over
whether the agent was at fault or acting in self-defence.</p>
<ul>
<li>roil,英 [rɔɪl] 美 [rɔɪl] vt. 搅浑；惹怒 vi. 动荡；喧闹
n. 小股汹涌的急流</li>
</ul>
<p>Ross has worked with ICE in Minnesota since 2017, BBC’s US news
partner CBS reported.</p>
<p>The Indiana National Guard also confirmed that Spc. Ross was deployed
to Iraq from November 2004 to November 2005 with Headquarters Company,
138th Signal Battalion. He was with the National Guard until 2008.</p>
<p>During his deployment, Ross received the Army Commendation Medal,
Army Good Conduct Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal and the Iraq
Campaign Medal.</p>
<p>Arguing in recent days that the ICE agent who killed Good was trying
to save his own life, federal officials said he had faced a previous
situation where a car pulled away during an investigation.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that in June he was
dragged by a car while attempting to arrest an “anti-ICE rioter“, and
“sustained injuries at that time“. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary
Tricia McLaughlin, meanwhile, told Fox News the officer received dozens
of stitches and had suffered “abrasions all over his body“ on 17 June,
while trying to arrest a “child sex offender“.</p>
<ul>
<li>rioter,英 [ˈraɪətə(r)] 美 [ˈraɪətər] n. 暴徒；暴民；骚乱者</li>
</ul>
<p>At a White House press briefing on Thursday, Vice-President JD Vance
said the officer “nearly had his life ended“ when he was “dragged by a
car six months ago“.</p>
<p>The Washington Post, citing an unnamed source, also reported that the
officer in the June case is the one who shot Good.</p>
<ul>

n. <美>引用，引文</li>
</ul>
<p>As an ICE agent, he is a member of a specialised response team,
which, according to the agency, works with high-risk warrants and
deportations of dangerous criminals.</p>
<p>The June incident also took place in Minnesota, where, according to
federal court records seen by the BBC, Ross and several other agents
were trying to apprehend a Guatemalan man, Roberto Carlos Muñoz.</p>
<p>When Ross told the driver to lower his window and open his door,
Muñoz refused.</p>
<p>Ross then reached into Muñoz’s vehicle with his right hand and
attempted to unlock the driver’s-side door. Muñoz drove up on the kerb
and accelerated away. Ross’s right arm was caught in the vehicle and he
was dragged along with it.</p>
<p>The officer fired his Taser at Muñoz, striking him with multiple
prongs in the side of the head, face, and shoulder, but Muñoz kept
driving for about 12 seconds until he managed to shake off the
agent.</p>
<p>Photos published in the court documents showed a man apparently lying
in a hospital bed with injuries on his right arm.</p>
<p>A jury found Muñoz guilty of assault on a federal officer with a
dangerous or deadly weapon. He is currently being held in jail and has
not yet been sentenced.</p>
<p>It is unclear when the agent returned to work following the June
incident.</p>
