<p>Both social media users and content creators say they’re worried that
AI slop flooding feeds is leading to a less authentic online experience
- and is drowning out real posts.</p>
<p>But a new trend, which sees people adding AI-generated animals to
original photographs, has encouraged some content creators to embrace
AI.</p>
<p>“I was like, that’s really niche because it looks so real,“
influencer Zoe Ilana Hill says.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old jumped on the trend after being impressed by the
imaginative way another content creator had used AI, by editing some of
her original photos and adding AI dogs.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see it [AI] as a threat to my career, I want to see
it as something I can work alongside with,“ the full-time influencer
says.</p>
<p>Zoe, who has 82,000 followers, says she feels like platforms such as
Facebook, Instagram and TikTok are trying to “push“ and “force AI“ on
users, and has seen her fair share of slop her own feed.</p>
<p>But she saw potential in the AI animal trend, adding that she
suspected the post would perform well as she thought social media users
would “be like, oh my God, she’s holding a deer“.</p>
<p>“The deer is so seasonal and that is so rare to be actually able to
go and physically see a deer in person,“ she says.</p>
<p>Zoe says her post was a success - with more than 20,000 likes and
comments including: “No stop this is the cutest thing ever“ and “this
trend is adorable!!!!“</p>
<p>Whenever Zoe posts a photo made with AI, she likes to make it clear
it’s a generated image, “there is actually a tag [on Instagram] where
you can say this photo was created by AI“.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s fair for people to think that something’s real
when it’s not.“</p>
<p>When influencers don’t disclose the use of AI - it can cause
confusion.</p>
<p>That was the case with one German influencer, with 900,000 followers,
posted a picture with dozens of AI dalmatians captioned: “just me,
living my dream“.</p>
<p>One user commented asking: “Is it AI? I saw a post like this three
times today.“</p>
<p>Another replied concerned for the generated animals’ welfare, adding
“there are plenty of dogs sitting in animal shelters who would like to
have a nice home“.</p>
<p>“Hot girls have started using AI,“ wrote one X user discussing the
trend by sharing animal photos from various influencers in a post viewed
almost 27 million times.</p>
<p>But not everyone sees using AI this way as harmless fun.</p>
<p>Another X user responded: “They are not hot because they use AI for
mindless slop that could easily be done by hand with Photoshop.“</p>
<p>Clara Sandell, a marketing professional and digital creator from
Finland took part in the trend after she saw it “everywhere“ and found
the posts “so cute“.</p>
<p>“I kind of put my own twist [on the trend], I used my spirit animals
and my favourite animals,“ the 38-year-old adds.</p>
<p>Clara posted a carousel photo on Instagram with tigers, an elk, a
horse, and cats and dogs.</p>
<p>Reaction from the photos were positive, with many labelling the post
as “chic“ and “beautiful“.</p>
<p>When asked if she would participate in future AI trends she replied
“depending on how cute the trend is,“ and if it was transparent so that
you can “see it’s AI“ being used.</p>
<p>For content creators looking to create high-quality images, social
media consultant Matt Navarra thinks that AI makes it easier to produce
“fantastical high gloss“ and “aesthetic“ content for influencers,
“whether it’s wild animals generated, through to something that’s much
more believable“.</p>
<p>Whilst some of the AI content we see online is unrealistic and
evidentially not real, Mr Navarra says “most people who are serious
about being a creator or an influencer want to maintain a
reputation“.</p>
<p>He believes many creators are “doubling down on the realness“ to give
themselves a place on the feed amongst “a sea of AI-generated content
which is flooding or AI slop as it’s been termed“.</p>
<p>The consultant says he predicts 2026 will be the year of AI dominated
content on social media, adding: “If you thought that AI animal content
was quirky, I think buckle up“.</p>
<p>But not everyone will be pleased to hear this.</p>
<p>Maddi Mathers, a tattoo artist from Melbourne commented “love you but
not the AI“ under the same German influencers post who created the AI
dalmatians.</p>
<p>Commenting isn’t something that Maddi, who describes herself as a
“very silent social media user“ would normally do.</p>
<p>But when the tattoo artist first saw the photo, she believed it was
real before but scrolling through the posts revealed the cute dalmatians
were “obviously very fake“.</p>
<p>“Honestly, it’s such a simple thing but it makes you feel dumb when
you get fooled by AI,“ the 25- year-old explains.</p>
<p>Maddi says such AI posts create an element of mistrust because
“there’s such an importance of being true to yourself and showing your
true personality“ when being an influencer.</p>
<p>She believes that when creators put out content that isn’t real it
can be “damaging for their career“ as their audience “won’t know what to
believe anymore“.</p>
<p>AI slop isn’t necessarily a bad thing - “but the speed and volume of
what we’re creating“ is what concerns creative health scientist Katina
Bajaj.</p>
<p>“When we’re creating and consuming AI-generated content at such a
rapid pace, we aren’t giving our brains enough time to digest,“ Mrs
Bajaj says.</p>
<p>She explains that from her perspective, the solution to AI slop isn’t
to ban it or “look down upon AI tools,“ but to “prioritise and value our
creative health more than generating endless content“.</p>
<p>There is currently no requirement “to label images that have been
created or altered with AI“ on Instagram, according to Meta’s
policy.</p>
<p>However, “images will still receive a label if Meta’s systems detect
that they were AI-generated“.</p>
<p>TikTok has recently launched a new tool which allows users to shape
their feed - this includes being able to see more or less AI generated
content.</p>
<p>The ‘Manage Topics’ feature is intended to help people tailor their
‘for you page’ to ensure users have a range of content in their feed,
rather than removing or replacing content entirely.</p>
<p>There is a lot of AI software that can be used to make this trend,
but not all can create the flawless content social media is
portraying.</p>
<p>Emily Manns, a fashion content creator from the US, didn’t quite get
what she bargained for when she bought multiple AI apps to join in with
the trend and received “one single rodent“ in what was meant to be an
aesthetic photo.</p>
<p>“I don’t even know what [the animal] was,“ said the 34-year-old.</p>
<p>“It [the photo] took like 2 minutes to load, and when it loaded, I
was peeing my pants of laughter.“</p>
<p>The app also added an extra finger onto the influencers hand, and
distorted her face.</p>
<p>Emily says she posted the photo to her Instagram but “deleted it
instantly“ because the content wasn’t engaging very well.</p>
