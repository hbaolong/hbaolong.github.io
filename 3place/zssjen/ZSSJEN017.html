id="年01月16日06时song-banned-from-swedish-charts-for-being-ai-creation">[2026年01月16日06时]Song
banned from Swedish charts for being AI creation</h4>
<p>A song which has been streamed millions of times in Sweden has been
banned from that country’s music charts because it was created by
Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>Called I know, You’re Not Mine - Jag vet, du är inte min - it is
currently top of the Spotify playlist of Sweden’s most popular songs.
But the singer is a digital creation and the country’s music industry
body has blocked the track from its official chart listings.</p>
<p>It’s a folk-pop song telling a melancholic story of lost love.</p>
<p>Backed by a finger-picked acoustic guitar melody, it weaves a tale of
late-night heartbreak, broken promises and shattered hopes.</p>
<p>“Your steps in the night, I hear them go,“ sings the artist known as
Jacub in a haunting voice.</p>
<p>“We stood in the rain at your gate and ran out and everything went
fast. Now I know you are not mine, your promises came to nothing.“</p>
<p>It quickly became Sweden’s biggest song of 2026 so far, amassing more
than five million Spotify streams in a matter of weeks, putting it at
the top of the platform’s Swedish Top 50.</p>
<p>However, journalists who began investigating Jacub’s identity found
that the artist had no significant social media profile, media
appearances or tour dates.</p>
<p>When investigative journalist Emanuel Karlsten began digging deeper,
he found that the song was registered to a group of executives connected
to Stellar Music, a music publishing and marketing firm based in
Denmark. Two of the individuals work in Stellar’s AI department.</p>
<p>The producers – calling themselves Team Jacub – issued a lengthy
email to Karlsten, insisting their creative process had been
misunderstood.</p>
<p>“We are not an anonymous tech company that just ‘pressed a button,’“
they wrote.</p>
<p>“The team behind Jacub consists of experienced music creators,
songwriters, and producers who have invested a lot of time, care,
emotions, and financial resources.“</p>
<p>They described AI as a “tool“ or an “assisting instrument“ within a
“human-controlled creative process“. To Team Jacub, they said, the five
million Spotify streams were proof of the song’s “long-term artistic
value.“</p>
<p>As to whether Jacub was a real person, Team Jacub gave a
philosophical response.</p>
<p>“That depends on how you define the term,“ they said.</p>
<p>“Jacub is an artistic project developed and carried by a team of
human songwriters, producers, and creators. The feelings, stories, and
experiences in the music are real, because they come from real
people.“</p>
<p>That response has not impressed the IFPI Sweden music industry
organisation, which has blocked the song from appearing in the country’s
official national charts.</p>
<p>“Our rule is that if it is a song that is mainly AI-generated, it
does not have the right to be on the top list,“ said Ludvig Werner, head
of IFPI.</p>
<p>Sweden is positioning itself as a global laboratory for the AI
economy, amid concerns that AI could cut revenues to the country’s music
creators by up to a quarter within the next two years.</p>
<p>Music rights society Svenska Tonsättares Internationella Musikbyrå
(STIM) launched a licensing system last September, allowing tech firms
to legally train their AI models on copyrighted works in return for
royalty payments.</p>
<p>At the launch, Lina Heyman from STIM described the framework as “the
world’s first collective AI licence“. She said it would “show that it is
possible to embrace disruption without undermining human
creativity.“</p>
<p>Sweden’s chart ban on Jag vet, du är inte min is tougher than the
approach taken by international organisations like Billboard, regarded
as the world authority on music rankings.</p>
<p>AI-generated tracks have featured in some of its specialist charts.
Billboard says that its charts reflect the tastes of listeners. Tracks
qualify if they meet its criteria for sales, streams and airplay, even
if they have been generated by algorithms.</p>
<p>Bandcamp, a platform known for supporting independent artists, has
taken a stricter position, however.</p>
<p>It has prohibited music that is “generated wholly or in substantial
part by AI.“ That includes tracks composed or produced by AI or using
voice clones.</p>
<p>AI-generated music is forecast to explode in the coming years into an
industry worth billions of pounds. As the needle drops on a new era of
digital music creation, the controversy in Sweden over Jacub suggests
that for now at least it is human musicians not machines who still call
the tune.</p>
