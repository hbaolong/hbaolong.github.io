and data centres drive up US greenhouse gas emissions</h4>
<ul>
<li>emission,英 [ɪˈmɪʃ(ə)n] 美 [ɪˈmɪʃ(ə)n]
n. 排放物，散发物；（尤指光、热、气等的）散发，排放；射精，遗精；<古>发行</li>
</ul>
<p>A very cold start to 2025 and the growing power demands of data
centres and cryptocurrencies saw US emissions of planet-warming gases
rise for the first time in three years, a new analysis shows.</p>
<p>Last year homes burned more gas for heating while the use of coal
surged by 13% to meet rising electricity demands, the data finds.</p>
<p>Although solar power also shot up last year, overall, greenhouse gas
emissions went up by 2.4% after two years of decreases, outpacing the
level of economic growth, according to estimates from the Rhodium
Group.</p>
<p>The authors say the policies of the Trump administration didn’t
“meaningfully impact“ the rise in emissions but they expect this to
change in the coming years.</p>
<p>In the colder parts of the United States, most homes rely on natural
gas and other fossil fuels for their heating.</p>
<p>The low temperatures experienced in early 2025 saw consumption of
these fuels increase by nearly 7% compared with the previous year.</p>
<p>Extra electric power was also needed by the boom in data centres and
cryptocurrency mining operations in places like Texas and the Ohio
Valley region.</p>
<p>The rising demand for power combined with the higher cost of gas was
behind the 13% surge in US coal use last year.</p>
<p>That was in marked contrast to both India and China, where coal use
for electricity dropped 3% and 1.6% respectively as both countries added
record amounts of wind and solar energy, according to an analysis for
the website, Carbon Brief.</p>
<p>“The grid decided to meet that additional load this year, in part
with renewables, in part with fossil but because of higher natural gas
prices, there was some fuel switching that saw marginally more coal than
there was in 2024,“ said Michael Gaffney, from Rhodium Group, the
report’s lead author.</p>
<p>Other observers see the high price of gas in the US as closely
related to continuing large exports of gas to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“Higher natural gas prices means that finally, coal, which had been
kind of driven to extinction by low natural gas prices, well [gas is]
now so expensive that coal’s worthwhile again,“ said Jesse Lee, from
Climate Power, a US-based environmental campaign group.</p>
<p>“And that’s what is allowing coal to make this comeback.“</p>
<p>Since 2007 coal power generation in the US has shrunk by 64%, with
last year’s rise only the second in the last decade.</p>
<p>Last year also saw a slowdown in the rate of coal plant retirements,
as electricity companies delayed closures to meet demands.</p>
<p>So is 2025 the start of the revival of coal?</p>
<p>“It’s more than just a blip,“ said Michael Gaffney.</p>
<p>“This is a response to the demand growth in the sector, a lot of it
is coming from data centres, cryptocurrency operations, other large load
customers, and that demand growth is here to stay.“</p>
<p>Solar power also experienced a major growth spurt in the US last
year, rising by 34%, the fastest rate since 2017.</p>
<p>Transport in the US, by road, rail and air remains the largest source
of warming gases, with road traffic volumes increasing for the fifth
year in a row.</p>
<p>However, emissions from this sector were virtually flat in 2025 due
to increasing numbers of hybrid and electric vehicles on the roads.</p>
<p>Hybrids, in particular, showed strong growth, up 25% compared to
2024.</p>
<p>While President Trump has been forceful in his determination to
rollback the climate-related policies of his predecessor, and to boost
US extraction of fossil fuel, Rhodium analysts who carried out this
report say those changes made little difference in 2025.</p>
<p>Some others disagree.</p>
<p>“There is a data centre explosion, that is somewhat independent of
Trump,“ says Lee, of Climate Power.</p>
<p>“You could argue maybe his policies haven’t all kicked in full blast
yet, but I don’t think you can really divorce his natural gas exports
and his blind support of AI and data centres from this dynamic that’s
driving up emissions.“</p>
