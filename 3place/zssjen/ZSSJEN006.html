hack: My darkest secrets were revealed to the world</h4>
<p>As soon as Meri-Tuuli Auer saw the subject line in her junk folder,
she knew it was no ordinary spam email. It contained her full name and
her social security number - the unique code Finnish people use to
access public services and banking.</p>
<p>The email was full of details about Auer no one else should know.</p>
<p>The sender knew she had been having psychotherapy through a company
called Vastaamo. They said they had hacked into Vastaamo’s patient
database and that they wanted Auer to pay €200 (£175) in bitcoin within
24 hours, or the price would go up to €500 within 48 hours.</p>
<ul>
<li>psychotherapy,英 [ˌsaɪkəʊˈθerəpi] 美 [ˌsaɪkoʊˈθerəpi]
n. 心理疗法；精神疗法</li>
</ul>
<p>If she did not pay, they wrote, “your information will be published
for all to see, including your name, address, phone number, social
security number and detailed patient records containing transcripts of
your conversations with Vastaamo’s therapists“.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>transcript,英 [ˈtrænskrɪpt] 美 [ˈtrænskrɪpt]

<li><p>therapist,英 [ˈθerəpɪst] 美 [ˈθerəpɪst]
n. 治疗专家；心理治疗师</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“That’s when the fear set in,“ Auer, 30, tells me. “I took sick leave
from work, I closed myself in at home. I didn’t want to leave. I didn’t
want people to see me.“</p>
<p>She was one of 33,000 Vastaamo patients held to ransom in October
2020 by a nameless, faceless hacker.</p>
<p>They had shared their most intimate thoughts with their therapists
including details about suicide attempts, affairs and child sexual
abuse.</p>
<ul>
<li>intimate,英 [ˈɪntɪmət] 美 [ˈɪntɪmət] adj.

v. 透露，暗示；宣布，通告 n. 密友，知己</li>
</ul>
<p>In Finland, a country of 5.6 million people, everyone seemed to know
someone who had their therapy records stolen. It became a national
scandal, Finland’s biggest-ever crime, and the then Prime Minister Sanna
Marin convened an emergency meeting of ministers to discuss a
response.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>therapy,英 [ˈθerəpi] 美 [ˈθerəpi]

</ul>
<p>But it was already too late to stop the hacker.</p>
<p>Before sending the emails to Vastaamo’s patients, the hacker had
published the entire database of records stolen from the company on the
dark web and an unknown number of people had read or downloaded a copy.
These notes have been circulating ever since.</p>
<p>Auer had told her therapist things that she didn’t even want her
closest family members to know - about her binge drinking, and a secret
relationship she’d been having with a much older man.</p>
<p>Now, her worst fears had come true.</p>
<p>But instead of destroying her, the hack made her realise she was far
more resilient than she could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>Auer’s flat, on the outskirts of Helsinki, looks joyful. Barbie
memorabilia fills her shelves and there’s a pole-dancing pole in the
centre of her living room. But don’t be fooled by how things seem on the
surface, Auer says. She has struggled with depression and anxiety for
most of her life.</p>
<p>“I’m outgoing and very confident and I love being around people,“
Auer says, “but I get that inkling that they all think I’m stupid and
ugly, and that my life is a continuum of mistakes.“</p>
<p>Auer first sought help in 2015. She told her Vastaamo therapist about
her mental health problems, her drinking and a relationship she’d had
aged 18 with an older man she’d kept secret from her family. She says
she trusted her therapist completely and with his help she made real
progress. She had no idea what he had written in his notes of their
conversations.</p>
<p>By the time she received the ransom email, news had already broken
about the Vastaamo hack. Three days earlier, the extortionist had begun
to drip-feed therapy notes on the dark web in batches of 100 a day, in
the hope of putting pressure on the company to pay the much larger
ransom - the bitcoin equivalent of around £400,000 - that he had been
demanding from them for weeks.</p>
<p>Auer says she felt compelled to look through them.</p>
<p>“I had never used the dark web before. But I was thinking to myself,
I just have to see if my records are there.“</p>
<p>When she discovered they were not, she closed the file and didn’t
read anyone else’s records, she says. But she saw how other people on
the dark web were mocking patients’ misery. “A 10-year-old child had
gone to therapy, and people found it funny.“</p>
<p>And a few days later, when it became clear the records of every
Vastaamo patient had been published, Auer’s mental health began to
deteriorate.</p>
<p>Unsure who was responsible, or who might have read her most private
thoughts, she became terrified to take public transport, leave home, or
even open the door to the postman. She doubted the hacker would be
found.</p>
<p>Finnish detectives also feared they wouldn’t find the suspect given
the volume of data they had to sift through.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t even imagine the scale of it. This isn’t a normal case,“
says Marko Lepponen, the detective who led the investigation for the
Finnish police.</p>
<p>But after two years of investigation, in October 2022, they named
their suspect: Julius Kivimäki, a known cybercriminal.</p>
<p>In February 2023 Kivimäki was arrested in France and transported back
to Finland to face charges.</p>
<p>No courtroom is large enough for to accommodate the 21,000 former
Vastaamo patients who had registered themselves as plaintiffs in the
criminal case, so screenings were held in public spaces including
cinemas to give them an opportunity to watch the trial.</p>
<p>Determined to see Kivimäki face justice, Auer attended one of the
screenings and was struck by how unremarkable he looked.</p>
<p>“He looks just like a regular Finnish young man,“ she tells me. “It
made me feel like it could have been anyone.“</p>
<p>When he was found guilty, and sentenced to six years and seven months
in prison, she says it felt like a validation.</p>
<p>“Whatever sentence he was given could never make up for everything.
The victims’ suffering was seen by the court - I was thankful for
that.“</p>
<p>Kivimäki continues to deny being responsible for the hack.</p>
<p>In the months after she learned about the hack, Auer requested a hard
copy of her records from Vastaamo.</p>
<p>Her notes sit in a thick stack on the table between us as she tells
me what happened.</p>
<p>Even though their records were released more than five years ago,
Vastaamo patients continue to be victimised. Someone has even built a
search engine that allows users to find records on the dark web just by
typing in a person’s name.</p>
<p>Auer agrees to share some of her leaked therapy records with me.</p>
<p>“The patient is mostly angry, impulsive, bitter,“ she says, reading
some of the first notes her therapist wrote about their sessions. “The
patient recounts their past in a rambling manner. There is some
interpersonal difficulty stemming from the patient’s weak-tempered
nature, typical for their age.“</p>
<p>When she read them for the first time she was heartbroken, Auer says.
“I was hurt by how he had described me. It made me feel sorry for the
person I had been.“</p>
<p>She says the data breach has eroded patient trust. “There are a lot
of people who were Vastaamo clients who had gone to therapy for years
but are now never going to book another therapy session.“</p>
<p>The lawyer representing Vastaamo’s victims in a civil case against
the hacker has told me she knows of at least two cases where people have
taken their own lives after learning their therapy notes had been
stolen.</p>
<p>Auer decided to confront her fears head on. She posted on social
media about the hack, letting everyone know that she had been one of the
victims.</p>
<p>“It was a a lot easier for me to know that everyone who knew me
already knew,“ she says. She spoke to her family about what was in her
leaked records, including the secret relationship she had never told
them about before. “People were very supportive.“</p>
<p>Finally, she chose to take back control of her story by publishing a
book about her experiences. Loosely translated, the title is Everyone
Gets to Know.</p>
<p>“I crafted it into a narrative. At least I can tell my side of the
story – the one that’s not visible in the patient records.“</p>
<p>Auer has come to accept that her secrets will always be out
there.</p>
<p>“For my own wellbeing, it’s just better not to think about it.“</p>
