braces for ‘extremely dangerous’ winter storm</h4>
<p>More than 200 million Americans are expected to face an unusually
brutal winter storm starting Friday, with heavy snows and freezing rains
forecast.</p>
<ul>
<li>brutal,英 [ˈbruːt(ə)l] 美 [ˈbruːt(ə)l] adj.
野蛮的，凶残的；毫不掩饰的，直截了当的；令人不快的，糟糕的</li>
</ul>
<p>The storm is expected to sweep through much of the United States,
leaving “extremely dangerous“ conditions in its wake as it tracks
eastwards from the High Plains and Rockies, the National Weather Service
(NWS) said.</p>
<p>It warned that the Arctic blast will bring sub-zero temperatures and
wind chills, which “pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and
frostbite to exposed skin“.</p>
<p>US transportation officials, including airport authorities in several
major cities, have warned of weekend travel disruption, delays and
cancellations.</p>
<p>The winter storm is forecast to move slowly across the US, blanketing
cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore,
Philadelphia and New York with snow.</p>
<p>Heavy snow is predicted through the Southern Rockies and Plains, into
the Mid-Atlantic and reaching the Northeast.</p>
<p>According to the NWS Probabilistic Precipitation Portal, the regions
that could see more than a foot of snow stretch from Colorado to West
Virginia to Boston.</p>
<p>Parts of northeast New Jersey and southeast New York, including New
York City, could see between 10 and 14 inches of snow starting early on
Sunday and lasting through Monday, the NWS predicts. And windchills as
low as -10F (-23C) are expected for the same region from Friday evening
to Saturday afternoon, the service says.</p>
<p>Most of southern New England, including Boston, can expect between 12
and 17 inches of snow and wind gusts up to 30mph from Sunday into
Monday, NWS says. Wind chill temperatures there could reach -15F (-26C)
Friday into Saturday.</p>
<p>Numerous low temperature records are likely to be broken, according
to the NWS, with the coldest wind chills potentially falling below -50F
(-46C) across the Northern Plains.</p>
<p>A much wider area of the south-eastern US is also forecast to
experience freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Parts of North Texas were already seeing sleet and ice on Friday
night.</p>
<p>Governors in several US states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Texas,
North Carolina, South Carolina, have declared states of emergency,
allowing emergency officials - including National Guard troops - to
begin mobilising response efforts.</p>
<p>In a press conference on Friday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said
the state has over 1,600 snow plows and 114,000 tonnes of salt on hand
for the storm, which she said will leave no corner of the state “immune
from feeling the effect of Mother Nature’s wrath“.</p>
<p>Hochul urged residents to work from home, stock up on groceries and
essentials ahead of time and be careful when shoveling snow, which can
increase the risk of a heart attack.</p>
<p>New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said Friday the city will be
deploying thousands of sanitation workers this weekend, 700 salt
spreaders and 2,200 snow plows once two inches of snow have accumulated.
While subways and buses will be operational this weekend, he urged New
Yorkers to stay home if they can.</p>
<p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Thursday there’s “no expectation
whatsoever“ that the state’s power grid will fail, as it did during a
major storm in 2021 which led to hundreds of deaths in the state.</p>
<p>There may be some local power outages due to falling ice and snow, he
said, but stressed that this would be different from a large-scale grid
failure.</p>
<p>“The local power providers have never been more prepared for any
winter storm ever,“ Abbott said.</p>
<p>In total, 16 states were under a state of emergency on Friday ahead
of the storm.</p>
<p>Some airlines have offered passengers the option to change their
flights, in some cases without incurring extra fees, due to concerns
about cancellations.</p>
<p>More than 3,200 flights within, into or out of the US have already
been cancelled for Saturday, as well as over 4,800 for Sunday, according
to flight tracker FlightAware.</p>
<p>Motorists should avoid driving across the weekend, with travel
expected to be “nearly impossible during the peak of the storm“, NWS
meteorologists Rich Otto and Tony Fracasso told the BBC’s US news
partner CBS.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Canada, freezing temperatures are already gripping the
country, with snowfall expected in eastern and Atlantic regions on
Monday, meteorologist Geoff Coulson told CBC earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Even after the storm passes through the US this weekend, a strong
arctic air mass originating in Canada will keep temperatures frigid in
the eastern US into next week, according to the NWS Weather Prediction
Center.</p>
