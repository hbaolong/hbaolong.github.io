<p>“My friends are all like me. We all know someone who was killed in
the protests.“</p>
<p>For Parisa, a 29-year-old from Tehran, the crackdown by security
forces in Iran earlier this month was unlike anything she had witnessed
before.</p>
<ul>

<h5 id="witness的单词故事"><a
href="./hash/0022.html">Witness的单词故事</a></h5>
<p>“In the most widespread previous protests, I didn’t personally know a
single person who had been killed,“ she said.</p>
<p>Parisa said she knew at least 13 people who had been killed since
protests over worsening economic conditions erupted in the capital on 28
December and then evolved into one of the deadliest periods of
anti-government unrest in the history of the Islamic Republic.</p>
<ul>
<li>erupt,英 [ɪˈrʌpt] 美 [ɪˈrʌpt] v.
喷发；爆发，突然发生；（感情）迸发；（斑疹等）突然冒出；长牙</li>
</ul>
<p>With one human rights group reporting that the number of people
confirmed killed has passed 6,000, several young Iranians able speak to
the BBC in recent days, despite a near-total internet shutdown, have
described the personal toll.</p>
<p>Parisa said one 26-year-old woman she knew was killed by “a hail of
bullets in the street“ when the protests escalated across the country on
Thursday, 8 January, and Friday, 9 January, and authorities responded
with lethal force to crush them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>hail,英 [heɪl] 美 [heɪl] v.

</ul>
<p>She herself took part in protests in the north of Tehran that
Thursday, which she insisted were peaceful.</p>
<p>“No-one was violent and no-one clashed with the security forces. But
on Friday night they still opened fire on the crowd,“ she said.</p>
<ul>
<li>clash,英 [klæʃ] 美 [klæʃ]

</ul>
<p>“The smell of gunpowder and bullets filled the neighbourhoods where
clashes were taking place.“</p>
<p>Mehdi, 24, who is also from Tehran, echoed her assessment of the
scale of the protests and violence.</p>
<p>“I had never seen anything even close to this level of turnout and
such killings and violence by the security forces,“ he said.</p>
<p>“Despite the killings on Thursday [8 January] and threats of more
killings on Friday, people came out, because many of them could no
longer endure it and had nothing left to lose,“ he added.</p>
<p>Mehdi described witnessing multiple killings of protesters at close
range by security forces.</p>
<p>“I saw a young man killed right in front of my eyes with two live
rounds,“ he said.</p>
<p>“Motorcyclists shot a young man in the face with a shotgun. He fell
on the spot and never got back up.“</p>
<p>The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) says it has
so far confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people since the unrest
began, including 5,804 protesters, 92 children and 214 people affiliated
with the government. It is also investigating 17,000 more reported
deaths.</p>
<ul>
<li>affiliate,英 [əˈfɪlieɪt] 美 [əˈfɪlieɪt] v.
使隶属，使紧密联系；<正式>加入；（组织）接纳……为成员
n. 附属机构，分支机构</li>
</ul>
<p>Skylar Thompson, from Hrana, told the BBC the confirmed number of
dead was very likely to rise.</p>
<p>“We are really committed to ensuring that every single piece of
verified information that we report on sits next to a name and a
location,“ she added.</p>
<p>Another group, Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that
the final toll could exceed 25,000.</p>
<p>Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people had
been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders
attacked by “rioters“.</p>
<ul>
<li>majority,英 [məˈdʒɒrəti] 美 [məˈdʒɔːrəti]
n. 大多数；<英>多数票；成年的法定年龄；多数党；少校军衔，少校职位 adj.

</ul>
<p>Most international news organisations, including the BBC, are barred
from reporting inside Iran. But videos showing security forces firing
live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC.</p>
<ul>
<li>ammunition,英 [ˌæmjəˈnɪʃ(ə)n] 美 [ˌæmjəˈnɪʃ(ə)n]
n. 弹药，军火；（批评或辩论中攻击他人的）把柄，证据</li>
</ul>
<p>Sahar, a 27-year-old from the capital, said she knew seven people who
had been killed.</p>
<p>She described how the security forces’ response to the unrest
escalated rapidly on 8 January.</p>
<p>During a protest that evening, Sahar and her friends sought refuge in
a nearby house after tear gas was fired.</p>
<ul>
<li>refuge,英 [ˈrefjuːdʒ] 美 [ˈrefjuːdʒ]
n. 庇护，避难；（行为和想法的）逃避，躲避；避难所，庇护处；<英>（街道中央的）避车岛，安全岛

</ul>
<p>“My friend stuck his head out of a window to see what was going on
and they shot him in the neck,“ she said.</p>
<p>Another friend was wounded by pellets and later bled to death after
avoiding going to hospital out of fear of being detained, according to
Sahar.</p>
<p>Sahar said a third friend died while being detained by the Islamic
Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC).</p>
<p>“They [officers] told his family to come to the IRGC intelligence
office. After a few days they rang and said, ‘Come and collect the
body.’“</p>
<p>On 9 January, Sahar said, live ammunition was fired openly and
“without mercy“ by uniformed security personnel.</p>
<p>“They were pointing lasers at people, and locals were opening their
car park doors for us to hide,“ she said.</p>
<p>The communications blackout compounded the trauma.</p>
<ul>
<li>trauma,英 [ˈtrɔːmə] 美 [ˈtrɔːmə]
n. 痛苦经历，挫折；精神创伤，心理创伤；损伤，外伤；不安，震惊，痛苦</li>
</ul>
<p>“Right now there’s no news at all,“ Sahar said. “Without internet or
phone lines we had no idea what was happening to anyone. We could barely
get calls through just to get bits of news.“</p>
<p>Parham, 27, described widespread use of pellet guns by security
forces in Tehran, particularly targeting protesters’ faces and eyes.</p>
<p>One of his friends, Sina, 23, was shot in the forehead and eye on 9
January.</p>
<p>“We took him to a hospital, but the doctor could only give us a
prescription and told us to leave as soon as possible,“ Parham said.</p>
<p>At an eye hospital, he added, wounded protesters arrived
constantly.</p>
<p>“Every 10 minutes, it felt like they were bringing in someone else
who had been hit by a pellet.“</p>
<p>A worker at the hospital’s cafe said she had seen “70 people with eye
injuries come in during a single shift“, according to Parham.</p>
<p>Sina - who still has pellets stuck behind one of his eyes and in his
forehead - said they had been scared of being arrested at the first
hospital because of the need to give their ID numbers, so they had gone
to a private eye hospital.</p>
<p>He said he was “lucky“ compared to the others who he saw at the eye
hospital, who had “pellets all over their faces and in both of their
eyes“.</p>
<p>The BBC has seen a medical document in Sina’s name that says “there
is a 5mm metallic foreign body“ behind his eye.</p>
<p>The medical records of a number of other protesters with pellet-gun
wounds have also been received and verified by the BBC.</p>
<p>Protesters and activists have also described a pattern of refusal by
the authorities to hand over the bodies of those killed to their
families.</p>
<p>Mehdi said his friend’s cousin was killed and that the family was
told by officials to either pay a large sum of money to receive his body
or agree to him being recorded as a member of the security forces.</p>
<p>“They said, ‘Either pay 1 billion tomans [more than ,000; £5,000] for
us to hand over the body to the family, or you have to say he was a
member of the Basij and was martyred for public security and against the
riots.’“</p>
<p>Navid, a 38-year-old from Isfahan, also said two close friends whose
relatives were killed had received such an ultimatum.</p>
<p>“They say you have to pay the equivalent of several thousand dollars
or let us issue them a Basij card so they are counted among the security
forces’ dead,“ he cited his friends as saying.</p>
<p>Human rights groups have warned that this practice has served both to
punish protesters’ families and obscure the true death toll.</p>
