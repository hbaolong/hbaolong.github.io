about using AI for festive swim tide time advice</h4>

<p>Thousands of people will take to the waters around the UK over the
festive season at organised swims that have been held for decades.</p>
<p>But those going it alone may want to heed Maritime and Coastguard
Agency warnings not to rely on AI tools when planning outdoor activities
as it can make mistakes.</p>
<p>The advice comes after two people became stranded on Sully Island,
near Barry, after ChatGPT gave them the wrong tide times and they had to
be rescued by the coastguard.</p>
<p><strong>The warning echoes advice from a top tech industry chief not
to “blindly trust“ everything AI tells people.</strong></p>
<p>The chief executive of Google’s parent company Alphabet, Sundar
Pichai, recently said</p>
<p>Does this incident show people would be wise to be wary of AI?</p>
<p>One of the rescued men thinks so.</p>
<p>He told social media news channel</p>
<p>The AI programme said low tide would be at 09:30, meaning their early
morning departure should have given sufficient time to walk over and
back to the island.</p>
<p>But the information was wrong by two hours and the causeway was
underwater when they attempted to return.</p>
<p>“Some false information there, but maybe a lesson learned for me,“ he
said.</p>
<p>HM Coastguard said: “While AI tools can be very useful, they draw
from a wide range of sources to gather information and responses which
may not be correct for a specific location or area.“</p>
<p>It recommended resources such as the UK Hydrographic Office’s</p>
<p>Information on tide times is easily available online - a search
engine will throw up multiple websites all giving the same, correct
information.</p>
<p>However, when the BBC asked ChatGPT the same question as the unlucky
visitors, it generated exactly the same, incorrect, response.</p>
<p>On another attempt it was out by five hours.</p>
<p>Open AI, which owns ChatGPT, said improving factual accuracy was a
“significant focus“ for the industry, and new models had significantly
fewer</p>
<p>Prof Steven Schockaert, head of the AI and data analytics research
section at Cardiff University’s school of computer science, said in this
instance the problem may lie with how the information is presented
online.</p>
<p>“I think the issue here is that the tide tables are shown in a table,
and the model struggles with extracting the correct value from the
table,“ he explains.</p>
<p>“Traditionally tables have been quite challenging for language models
because they’ve been trained on language, so words [written] left to
right. Tables don’t have that kind of structure.“</p>
<p><strong>He advises people to stick to asking AI for information that
you can verify yourself, such as drafting emails.</strong></p>
<p>“But if you ask it for factual information then you don’t have any
guarantee of whether it’s going to be correct or not.</p>
<p>“<strong>I think it’s probably not a good idea to rely on them for
information that you can’t verify and that’s somehow important, like in
this case the tides.</strong>“</p>
<p>Sam Skyrme-Blackhall chairs Tenby Sea Swim Association, which runs
the Boxing Day event.</p>
<p>She swims year-round and knows the challenges the water presents.</p>
<p>For the organised event, there are multiple safety measures in place,
with marshals on the beach, surf lifesavers and the RNLI out at sea to
watch festive dippers.</p>
<p>On land, St John Ambulance provides medical backup.</p>
<p>However, she believes things like picture-perfect social media
portrayals of the coast can make people overestimate what they are
capable of.</p>
<p>“It’s like a storybook, isn’t it? It’s all glossy but the reality is
there are hidden dangers.</p>
<p>“These are tidal beaches - I check the tide times weekly to see where
I am but also check the conditions.</p>
<p>“<strong>Listen to the professionals. Listen to the local people who
have the knowledge.</strong>“</p>

<p><strong>Sometimes AI can both help and hinder trips to the
outdoors.</strong></p>
<p>Aberdyfi Search and Rescue Team rescued two walkers who had used AI
to plan their excursion up Cader Idris near Dolgellau, the highest peak
in southern Eryri - also called Snowdonia.</p>
<p>Team leader Phil Britton and deputy leader Gareth Davies have over 50
years of experience between them, and were part of the rescue group.</p>
<p>The pair told Phil they had used AI to check the weather and for
equipment suggestions - unfortunately, it was the day</p>
<p>Phil described the pair, new to mountain walking, as “reasonably well
prepared“, adding: “If you had a list of stuff you should take, they had
it.“</p>
<p>He says their inexperience meant they lacked the right judgement,
whatever the information the AI had given them.</p>
<p>“I think they had a report of 60mph winds on top. To them it didn’t
mean anything.</p>
<p>“In mountain rescue what we’re finding is, there’s all the
information there, but it’s always interpreting it to the real-life
situation if you haven’t got the experience.“</p>
<p>The pair had reached the summit and taken shelter in a hut, but had
realised the situation was now beyond their capabilities.</p>
<p>This time, AI came to their rescue.</p>
<p>Gareth, who met the pair after they had been walked partway down the
mountain by colleagues, said: “Someone said this is how they’d found out
what to do. They’d spoken into an AI provider and said ‘we are stuck on
a mountain in the UK, what do we do’?“</p>
<p><strong>Gareth thinks the men were “no fools“ and had the kit and the
fitness for the trip but made “a little bit of an error in
judgement“.</strong></p>
<p>But it reinforces for him that <strong>there is no replacement for
human experience.</strong></p>
<p>Like Sam, he recommends seeking out local knowledge, either in person
or via online forums.</p>
<p>“I’m a recreational walker. I’ve done some of the more tricky walks,
but if an experienced walker said ‘it was a lot for me’, I’d probably
want to go with a mate or someone who knew the mountain a bit
better.“</p>
<p>For Phil, whether it’s AI, apps or phone batteries, there is a common
theme: “<strong>Technology’s brilliant, but you’ve got to know its
limitations.</strong>“</p>
