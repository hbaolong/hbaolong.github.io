Traitors returns with new ‘secret traitor’ in major shake-up</h4>
<ul>
<li>traitor,英 [ˈtreɪtə(r)] 美 [ˈtreɪtər] n. 叛徒，卖国贼</li>
</ul>
<p>The Traitors has returned to TV screens with a major new twist - a
secret fourth traitor whose identity has not even been revealed to
viewers.</p>
<p>The secret traitor, who wears a red cloak instead of the usual green,
has been given certain powers such as deciding which players the other
traitors are allowed to murder.</p>
<p>The ingenious new twist changes the dynamic of the civilian series
and marks the most significant format change since the show’s launch in
2022.</p>
<p>It was revealed as the fourth regular series of the BBC show launched
on Thursday, hot on the heels of the successful celebrity version, which
attracted more than 15 million viewers.</p>
<p>The new crop of 22 players includes a former police detective and a
crime novelist, as well as a mother and daughter keeping their
connection a secret.</p>
<p>Two other players also recognised each other at the castle because
they have a mutual friend. Their link was not known to producers
beforehand (but more on that in a moment).</p>
<p>This is the first time a fourth traitor has been assigned in the
opening episode, and it’s fair to say the other traitors were not happy
about somebody else holding some of the power.</p>
<p>“I do not require middle management,“ said traitor Hugo, speaking for
the nation as he delivered the best line of the episode.</p>
<p>“The whole point of being a traitor is having perfect
information.“</p>
<p>For viewers who often complain that the faithful are useless at
rooting out traitors, the twist will allow fans to play along and see
whether they can do any better.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad they’ve done this, because it was so infuriating when
people were like ‘how did you not know?’,“ former Celebrity Traitors
contestant Lucy Beaumont said on Uncloaked.</p>
<p>At the series launch last month, Winkleman told journalists the other
traitors were “livid“ when they found out about their anonymous
companion.</p>
<p>“But it’s really fantastic for the secret traitor,“ she added,
“having the time of their lives.“</p>
<p>The presenter reflected: “People who watch The Traitors endlessly go,
‘How do they [the faithful] not know?’ So I like the idea of, ‘OK, have
a go’.“</p>
<p>But, some viewers might wonder, couldn’t it be quite a lonely
experience for the secret traitor, without the camaraderie of working
with the other three? “Oh don’t worry,“ Winkleman replied, “they have
some fun.“</p>
<p>The format change came about partly because of something viewers
suggested on social media during earlier seasons.</p>
<p>“In series one, people said, ‘Wouldn’t it be interesting if the
viewers didn’t know who the traitors are?’“ recalled Mike Cotton,
creative director of production company Studio Lambert.</p>
<p>“And we don’t agree with that, actually. I think we think that
knowing who the traitors are, knowing their duplicity, is what makes it
feel great.</p>
<p>“But we thought it would be interesting if you didn’t know who</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>of them was. I think it could change the conversation slightly for
this season.“</p>
<p>Cotton added: “What’s really interesting is the traitors are used to
having all of the power, and for once they don’t.</p>
<p>“There’s a shortlist they can murder from, but they don’t have free
rein over who to kill, so what’s going to be really interesting to see
is how they navigate that.“</p>
<p>After three seasons, producers clearly felt it was time to experiment
with tweaks to the format – something networks often do to keep an
established hit feeling fresh.</p>
<p>Although an intriguing idea, viewers will have to wait and see what
impact the secret traitor has on the rest of the series.</p>
<p>Previous format changes have not always worked out, such as the
highly unpopular “Seer“ twist last year, which effectively made it
impossible for one particular player to win, and removed the tension
from the finale.</p>
<p>But this twist means the series is off to a promising start and will
have people sharing their theories by water coolers in offices around
the country.</p>
<p>Here are five other things we spotted in the opening episode:</p>
<p>Perhaps the law of averages means this was bound to happen at some
point, but, this season, two players already knew each other from having
a mutual friend.</p>
<p>Although previous series have seen couples or family members
deliberately cast together, Cotton said in this case it “was not
intentional at all, we cast them as individuals“.</p>
<p>“We do really lengthy background checks on who takes part, and as
part of that we discovered that they [Netty and Ross] follow each other
on social media,“ he recalled.</p>
<p>“So we knew there was a tenuous link, but we didn’t know whether they
would recognise each other, or how they would react.“</p>
<p>We aren’t keeping count, but we’re pretty sure more players than ever
requested to be traitors this year during their fireside chats with
Winkleman.</p>
<p>“A lot of them just say, ‘I think it would be more fun’,“ Winkleman
explained.</p>
<p>“And at some point, I’d really like to lean forward and say, ‘That’s
actually not how you win, statistically’.“</p>
<p>She added: “You had to pick someone who wanted it. In the celebrity
version, lots of them asked to be faithful. In this cast I think it was
one.“</p>
<p>Eventually, Winkleman plumped for Rachel, Hugo and Stephen – plus, of
course, the fourth traitor, whose identity remains a secret.</p>
<p>“You never know whether you’ve picked right,“ Winkleman concluded,
“but I’d like to think there isn’t a wrong.“</p>
<p>The first mission saw the players set out on boats to retrieve
floating coffins, dozens of which were spread out over a nearby
loch.</p>
<p>The coffins were collected by the three teams in canoes and towed
ashore, with each being worth £1,000 for the prize fund.</p>
<p>However, to complete the task, the contestants had to place the
coffins in the named graves of players, automatically shortlisting them
for murder.</p>
<p>Being British, all three teams opted to choose players from a
different team to avoid any awkward conversations, and a total of 10
players were eventually selected for the murder shortlist.</p>
<p>Two of this year’s players – Roxy and Judy – are also mother and
daughter, with Judy explaining she adopted Roxy when she was four.</p>
<p>While this time the link was a deliberate piece of casting, the other
players don’t know about their connection yet.</p>
<p>“One of the great things about the regular series is the contestants
can come in with secrets, whether that’s about their lives or secret
relationships,“ Cotton said.</p>
<p>Asked how producers decide when to reveal any relationship to other
players and viewers, he said: “We never know when we’re going to deploy
it. When we’re going into filming, we go in, and wait to see how it
plays out.“</p>
<p>The episode opened with the presenter singing along to Fleetwood
Mac’s Little Lies, before skipping to The Fugees’ cover of Killing Me
Softly.</p>
<p>Both bangers, obviously, but also deliberately selected to be
perfectly in keeping with the themes of the show.</p>
<p>For the fifth season, we are keeping our fingers crossed for Trick Me
by Kelis, Walkin’ After Midnight by Madeleine Peyroux, No Body, No Crime
by Taylor Swift and Kill Bill by SZA (note: would require a contestant
called Bill).</p>
<p>And if any pop stars are reading, if one of you could write a song
with the word “roundtable“ in the title before 2027, we’d appreciate
it.</p>
<p>The Traitors continues on Friday 2 January at 20:00 GMT on BBC One
and iPlayer.</p>
