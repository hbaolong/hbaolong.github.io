Kong billionaire Jimmy Lai tested China’s limits. It cost him his
freedom</h4>
<p>On a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into
Hong Kong’s Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who
had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged
with</p>
<p>They had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong
Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding
democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory.</p>

<p>In prison, he “loved eating rice with pickled ginger,“ Chan said.

</ul>
<p>But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison,
the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong
just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the
irreverent nickname “Fatty Lai“: he had lost considerable weight.</p>
<ul>
<li>boisterous,英 [ˈbɔɪstərəs] 美 [ˈbɔɪstərəs] adj.
喧闹的；狂暴的；猛烈的</li>
</ul>
<p>Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger
- they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure
in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular
newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal
democracy.</p>
<p>That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed
in 2020 by China’s Communist Party rulers in Beijing.</p>
<p>Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he
refused to leave.</p>
<p>“I got everything I have because of this place,“ he told the BBC
hours before he was arrested in 2020. “This is my redemption,“ he said,
choking up.</p>
<p>He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him.
That’s what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist
Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. It
cost him his own freedom.</p>
<p>Lai harboured “a rabid hatred“ of the Chinese Communist Party and “an
obsession to change the Party’s values to those of the Western world“,
the High Court ruled on Monday as it delivered the verdict in his
trial.</p>
<p>It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the
very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.</p>
<p>“Never,“ Lai had said to that charge when he testified, arguing that
he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong’s values:
“rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom
of religion, freedom of assembly“.</p>
<p>Monday’s verdict was welcomed by Hong Kong’s chief executive John
Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to “wantonly create social
conflicts“ and “glorify violence“. The law, he added, never allows
anyone to harm the country “under the guise of human rights, democracy
and freedom“.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to
pray with him, to Wong’s surprise.</p>
<p>Lai’s Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an
arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six
hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to
friends. “Even though he was suffering,“ Wong said, “he didn’t complain
nor was he afraid. He was at peace.“</p>
<p>Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not
when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the
gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong
tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.</p>
<p>For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply
capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the
city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found
success - and then a voice.</p>
<p>Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly
after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the
aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price
war.</p>
<p>From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the “adult section“ to
investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a
“buffet“ targeting “a full range of readers“, said Francis Lee, a
journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Former editors and employees spoke of Lai’s encouragement - “If you
dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it“ - and his temper. One
said he often swore.</p>
<p>They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn’t
afraid to bet on experiments. “Even before the iPhone was launched, he
kept saying mobile phones would be the future,“ recalled one of the
paper’s editors, adding that he was full of ideas. “It was as if he
asked us to create a new website every day.“</p>
<p>It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. “He was not
afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making
enemies,“ said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival
brand.</p>
<p>That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: “Otherwise, there
would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn’t have ended up
like this either.“</p>
<p>An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old
Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at
him.</p>
<p>It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>It was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as
a boy.</p>
<p>After carrying a passenger’s luggage at a railway station in China,
Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. “I asked
him where he’s from. He said Hong Kong. I said, ‘Hong Kong must be
heaven’ because I had never tasted anything like that,“ Lai said of the
encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Life in Mao Zedong’s China was punctuated by waves of oppressive
campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist
“class enemies“. The Lais, once a family of business people, were
blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His
mother was sent to a labour camp.</p>
<p>Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be
dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to
kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon
became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: “My tears
flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was
burning with humiliation.“</p>
<p>Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message:
“You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned
peanuts!“</p>
<p>And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions
who fled the mainland - and Mao’s devastating rule - over the years.</p>
<p>The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about
80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described
the long working hours as a “very happy time, a time that I knew I had a
future“. It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn
English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court
in fluent English.</p>
<p>By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making
money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was
27.</p>
<p>Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he
was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom
by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of
free-market capitalism. “People’s spontaneous reaction“ and “the
exchange of information“ have created the best in the world, was his
takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong’s strength.</p>
<p>The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same
book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired. “I want
to turn the author’s thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a
garden, not cut flowers,“ he said in a 2009 interview.</p>
<p>After a decade in manufacturing, he was “bored“ and founded the
clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It
was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his
Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.</p>
<p>Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao
died. He was “excited“, China “was going to be changed, like a Western
country“, he said in the 2007 documentary.</p>
<p>Then in 1989, Beijing</p>
<p>Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and
anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across
Hong Kong.</p>
<p>A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student
protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that
mourned the massacre.</p>
<p>Lai said later that he “didn’t feel anything about China“ until then.
He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but “all of a
sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the
night“.</p>
<p>The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994
published an open letter to Li Peng, “the Butcher of Beijing“ who played
a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him “the son of a turtle
egg with zero intelligence“.</p>
<p>Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano’s flagship store
in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and
stepped down as chairman.</p>
<p>“If I just go on making money, it doesn’t mean anything to me. But if
I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is
choice, and choice is freedom,“ Lai said in the 2007 documentary.</p>
<p>He soon became a “very active participant“ in Hong Kong’s
pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee
Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: “I
entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that
restrains personal liberties.“ He also started to voice concerns about
the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997.</p>
<p>“After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud
to return to the embrace of the motherland,“ he wrote. “But should we
love the motherland even if it doesn’t have freedom?“</p>
<p>During the handover, however, China’s then-leader Jiang Zemin
promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have
a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.</p>
<p>The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing’s refusal to allow
completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for
Lai.</p>
<p>Protesters occupied the city’s main commercial districts for 79 days.
Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw
animal entrails at him. “When the police started firing tear gas, I was
with Fatty,“ the former lawmaker Lee recalled.</p>
<p>The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be
cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019,
Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that
would have allowed extradition to mainland China.</p>
<p>What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning
the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw
bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot
police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live
rounds.</p>
<p>Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for
participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC
he was surprised to see Lai: “To me, he’s a busy businessman, but he
showed up.“</p>
<p>Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a
sounding board for an anti-government movement.</p>
<p>Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was “instrumental“ in the
protests because Apple Daily carried a “totally false“ slogan –
anti-extradition to China – which “caught the imagination of people who
wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong“.</p>
<p>Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai
exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national
security trial.</p>
<p>Lai instructed the editorial team to “urge people to take to the
streets“, according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple
Daily’s parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution
witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was
raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.</p>
<p>During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met
then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A
month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a
controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily
readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to “save Hong
Kong“.</p>
<p>All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a
foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong’s internal affairs.</p>
<p>“Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo
any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from
Beijing,“ Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 “are totally against
common sense“.</p>
<ul>
<li>tacit,英 [ˈtæsɪt] 美 [ˈtæsɪt] adj.
心照不宣的，不言而喻的，默示的</li>
</ul>
<p>Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from “chaos to governance“ and
onto “greater prosperity“ because of the national security law and a
“patriot-only“ parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands
of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and
the city’s freedoms severely curbed.</p>

nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places
freely, while our good friends were jailed?“</p>
<p>Lai’s family has been calling for his release for years, citing
concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have
been rejected so far. The government and Lai’s Hong Kong legal team have
said that his medical needs are being met.</p>
