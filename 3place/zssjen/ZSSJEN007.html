Fed holds interest rates and defends central bank independence</h4>
<p>The US Federal Reserve has voted to hold interest rates as its chair,
Jerome Powell, defended the importance of central bank independence.</p>
<p>The Fed said it will keep its key lending rate between 3.5% to 3.75%,
stating that economic activity in the US “has been expanding at a solid
pace“.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump has frequently criticised Powell for not
cutting rates quickly enough. Federal prosecutors recently opened a
criminal investigation over testimony Powell gave to the Senate about
renovations to Fed buildings.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Powell declined to comment on the probe but he said
that if a central bank lost its independence “it would be hard to
restore the credibility of the institution“.</p>
<p>Powell previously said he believed the federal investigation stemmed
from Trump’s anger at the pace of interest rate cuts.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, at his first press conference since condemning the
Department of Justice (DoJ) probe, he stressed the importance of central
bank independence to ensure monetary policy is not leveraged for
political gain.</p>
<p>“It’s just an institutional arrangement that has served the people
well - to not have direct elected official control over the setting of
monetary policy,“ he said.</p>
<p>“If you lose that, it first of all would be hard to restore the
credibility of the institution,“ Powell said, adding that he is
“strongly committed“ to retaining the Fed’s independence.</p>
<p>Trump is soon expected to announce a replacement for Powell who steps
down as chair in May.</p>
<p>Former heads of the US central bank also strongly criticised the DoJ
investigation, describing it as a bid to undermine the Fed’s
autonomy.</p>
<p>Commenting on the decision to keep rates on hold, Powell said: “The
economy has once again surprised us with its strength.“</p>
<p>There are signs the employment market is stabilising - job creation
is sluggish but the unemployment rate has ticked lower. Policymakers are
continuing to monitor the effect on the economy of three interest cuts
last year.</p>
<p>Powell said: “We still have some tension between employment and
inflation, but it’s less than it was.</p>
<p>“The outlook for economic activity has clearly improved since the
last meeting.“</p>
<p>Concerns about a slowing job market outweighed inflation fears in the
second half of 2025. Cutting interest rates is aimed at stimulating the
job market by creating lower borrowing costs for businesses.</p>
<p>Jitters about a deteriorating jobs market have eased in recent weeks
but inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target.</p>
<p>The SandandandandP 500 stock index fluctuated ahead of Powell’s
remarks, briefly surpassing 7,000 points for the first time, before
closing virtually unchanged.</p>
<p>Two Fed officials voted in favour of an interest rate cut - Stephen
Miran, who is on leave from his post at the White House where he leads
Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, and Christopher Waller, a Trump
appointee whose name has been floated as contender to succeed
Powell.</p>
<p>Despite those dissents, the Fed board pointed to a strengthening in
recent economic data, which gave policymakers confidence to hold rates
steady</p>
<p>“The Fed song remains the same,“ said Ellen Zentner, chief economic
strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. “Lower interest rates
may be coming but investors will have to remain patient.</p>
<p>“While the Fed’s pause may not satisfy everyone, it still leaves a
path for cuts later this year,“ she added.</p>
<p>Trump has publicly urged Powell to cut interest rates in order to
reduce the US government’s hefty borrowing costs and to make it easier
for Americans to get mortgages and other loans.</p>
<ul>
<li>hefty,英 [ˈhefti] 美 [ˈhefti] adj.

</ul>
<p>He has also launched personal attacks against Powell - whom the
president appointed as Fed chair during his first term in the White
House - calling the central banker a “major loser“ and “numbskull“.</p>
<p>The president has also taken aim at Fed governor Lisa Cook, who he
wants to remove. He has accused her of engaging in mortgage fraud, which
she has denied. The Supreme Court is now weighing the case.</p>
<p>Justices from the left and right last week cited concerns about
implications for central bank independence and the wider economy.</p>
<p>Powell attended the Supreme Court hearing and on Wednesday called it
“perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed’s 113-year
history“.</p>
<p>Another wild card looming over the bank is Trump’s pick to replace
Powell at the end of his term.</p>
<p>Whoever steps into the role will inevitably face credibility
concerns, as Trump’s pressure on the Fed has raised questions about
whether the next chair will act independently.</p>
<p>BlackRock executive Rick Rieder has emerged in recent days as a
front-runner.</p>
