id="年01月16日06时swiss-bar-employee-who-reportedly-held-sparkler-unaware-of-dangers-family-says">[2026年01月16日06时]Swiss
bar employee who reportedly held sparkler unaware of dangers, family
says</h4>
<p>A staff member who was working at the Swiss bar where a deadly fire
broke out on New Year’s Eve received no safety training and was unaware
of the danger posed by the ceiling that caught alight, her family’s
lawyer has alleged.</p>
<p>Cyane Panine, 24, died in the fire at Le Constellation bar in Crans
Montana and was widely identified in a video wearing a helmet and
holding a champagne bottle with a sparkler attached when the ceiling
caught fire.</p>
<p>The bar’s French owners, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been
accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by
negligence and arson by negligence.</p>
<p>Forty people were killed and 116 were injured in the blaze in
southwest Switzerland.</p>
<p>Pope Leo XIV met relatives of some of those killed in the disaster on
Thursday and said he was “very moved and distraught“ to talk to them at
the Vatican. “Where can one find a consolation equal to what you are
experiencing?“ he asked.</p>
<p>Sophie Haenni, the lawyer representing Cyane Panine’s family, told
the BBC she “wasn’t supposed to be serving tables“ on the night of the
fire but had been asked to go downstairs to help manage high demand for
bottles.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t Cyane herself who decided to put on this helmet, it was at
the request of her employers. She was just doing her job.“</p>
<p>It is shocking to place the responsibility for their own failings on
Cyane, a 24-year-old woman and their own employee“.</p>
<p>Ms Haenni added that Cyane Panine had never been informed “of the
ceiling’s danger and received no safety training“.</p>
<p>A source who has seen the inquiry documents said that Jessica Moretti
told investigators they had used sparklers in champagne bottles for the
past 10 years.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t the first time she’d done it, putting herself on someone
else’s shoulders,“ Ms Moretti told them. “She did it on her own
initiative.“</p>
<p>In a statement, Sophie Haenni said the casualties “could have been
avoided“ if “safety standards (particularly regarding materials) had
been followed and the required inspections carried out“. She added:
“Cyane is undoubtedly a victim.“</p>
<p>The Panine family’s lawyers also say she “felt used“ and was
“suffering from her working conditions“.</p>
<p>“[Cyane Panine] expressed her incomprehension at the lack of empathy
and understanding from her employers“ in regards to her workload, the
statement adds.</p>
<p>“My clients have lost their daughter, their sister. A loved one, a
wonderful person, has been stolen from them,“ the statement says.</p>
<p>The BBC has contacted lawyers for Jacques and Jessica Moretti for a
response.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a Swiss court imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti
as an alternative to pre-trial detention due to what prosecutors claim
is a “risk of flight“. She has had to surrender her passport and must
report to police every day, authorities say.</p>
<p>She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the
“unthinkable tragedy“.</p>
<p>Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90
days. Prosecutors have also argued that he is a flight risk.</p>
<p>Initial findings from the investigation into the blaze suggest that
it was caused by sparklers igniting soundproof foaming that lined the
ceiling.</p>
<p>Authorities have acknowledged that the bar in the popular ski resort
had not undergone safety checks for five years.</p>
<p>The Swiss canton of Valais has now banned pyrotechnic devices in all
indoor public venues.</p>
<p>Authorities said each of the victims would get a 10,000 franc (2,500;
£9,200) emergency payment, with a fund being set up to collect
donations.</p>
