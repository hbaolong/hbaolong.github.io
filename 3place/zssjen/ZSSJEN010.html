Husain: New Doha museum Lawh Wa Qalam celebrates Indian art legend</h4>
<p>At the edge of Doha, a new grey-blue building rises like a drawing on
its skyline, its shimmering tiles shifting with the sun and casting
geometric shadows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>shimmer,英 [ˈʃɪmə(r)] 美 [ˈʃɪmər] v. （使）闪烁；发闪烁的微光
n. 闪光，闪烁；微光</p></li>
<li><p>tile,英 [taɪl] 美 [taɪl]

v. 铺瓦，铺砖；（计算机）平铺（窗口）</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The building seems to be leaning forward, as if eager to tell a
story.</p>
<p>In a video clip of Lawh Wa Qalam, the world’s first museum dedicated
to MF Husain, we see glimpses of the extraordinary work of the late
legendary Indian artist, whose prolific paintings and turbulent personal
history have fascinated the world.</p>
<p>The museum honours the legacy of the artist who spent his last years
in Qatar and was granted citizenship in 2010.</p>
<p>Spanning over some 3,000 sq m, it opened to visitors last week and is
part of the expansive campus of Qatar Foundation’s Education City, an
educational and research hub.</p>
<p>Inside, more than 150 works and objects - including paintings,
sculptures, films, tapestries and photos - map the astonishing breadth
of Husain’s career, offering visitors a rare window into the artist’s
late-life reflections and inspirations.</p>
<p>Husain always wanted his museum to feel like home, says Noof
Mohammed, the curator. “We want visitors to experience the world as he
did, in an intimate, playful and reflective manner.“</p>
<p>Few artists have travelled as widely, or imaginatively, as Husain.
His horses - muscular and dynamic - remain some of the most prized and
instantly recognisable paintings in contemporary art, sold for millions
of dollars.</p>
<p>An artist who was often described to have a nomadic and bohemian
disposition, he dabbled seamlessly with Cubist-inspired modernism and
traditional Indian themes, creating bold and vibrant canvases with
scenes from history and mythology.</p>
<p>His signature style earned him the moniker of “the Picasso of India“.
He also made two Bollywood films, which failed at the box office.</p>
<p>Husain was also never without controversy. His paintings of nude
Hindu goddesses angered hardline Hindus who accused him of obscenity,
forcing him into a self-imposed exile.</p>
<p>After a tumultous few years, it was in Qatar, away from the cultural
battles at home, that he entered a period of deep contemplation and
artistic renewal.</p>
<p>“He was deeply engaged here, charmed and inspired by the Arab
civilisation and culture,“ Yousef Ahmad, a Qatar-based artist who knew
Husain during his final years, told the BBC.</p>
<p>“People often forget that some of his most ambitious works in later
life were conceived in Qatar.“</p>
<p>It is fitting then that the Lawh Wa Qalam museum refuses to be a
conventional tribute to the artist.</p>
<p>One of the museum’s main attractions is Seeroo fi al ardh (Walk In
The Land), the ambitious multimedia project that occupied Husain’s final
years, which he envisaged as a narrative of civilisation told through
movement, sound and mechanical choreography.</p>
<p>In fact, the museum building itself is inspired by a 2008 sketch
Husain made, showing two sculptural masses - the vivid blue-grey house
connected by a cylindirical tower.</p>
<p>Indian architect Martand Khosla, who designed the structure with the
Qatar Foundation, recalls the challenge of working from a single
drawing, imagining countless conversations with the artist.</p>
<p>“A sketch does not have scale. It is an intent. And converting that
intent into an actual functional museum was a different ballgame,“ he
tells the BBC.</p>
<p>Rather than treating Husain’s sketch as a blueprint, Mr Khosla used
it as a philosophical starting point: “What should remain literal and
what is metaphorical?“</p>
<p>“It was like developing a new architectural language,“ he says.</p>
<p>The result is a labyrinthine layout that invites visitors to wander,
exploring every line, shade, and shadow as if following Husain’s own
brushstrokes.</p>
<p>“We hope the museum sparks discovery the same way Husain’s murals do
- each visit can reveal a completely different experience or discovery “
Mr Khosla says.</p>
<p>Each gallery opens with a Husain quote, inviting visitors into his
thoughts. Long corridors lead to immersive displays of paintings,
sculptures, and everyday objects - including his old Indian passport -
tell the story of an artist, filmmaker, and philosopher who traveled the
world yet never stopped yearning for India.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Husain’s beloved horses take centre stage in the
museum.</p>
<p>“We have tried to gather oral histories by talking to people who knew
Husain, such as his driver, collaborators and friends, to give a
personal sense of who he was,“ Ms Mohammed explains.</p>
<p>Mr Ahmad, the artist, says the museum’s interactive format offers a
chance to understand the artist beyond the public controversies and lore
that defined his life.</p>
<p>Many recall Husain as the barefoot, eccentric artist with flowing
white hair and a penchant for controversies.</p>
<p>“But at his core, he was a genius who was endlessly fascinated by
storytelling, whether it was through mythology, modernity or memory,“ Mr
Ahmad adds.</p>
<p>A lesser-known chapter of Husain’s journey unfolded in the Gulf,
which the museum highlights. In his later years, he developed a deep
interest in Islamic texts and Arab history.</p>
<p>In 2008, Husain accepted a major commission from Qatar’s Sheikh Moza
bint Nasser, chairperson of Qatar Foundation. From a studio in Doha, he
created a vast series celebrating Arab civilisation, exploring Islamic
history, faith, and human movement.</p>
<p>Using a rich, bold palette, he depicted Islamic astronomers,
philosophers, and desert wanderers with the same kinetic lines that
defined his Indian art, but in warmer, earthen ochres reflecting the
Gulf’s landscape.</p>
<p>“One of these paintings, The Battle of Badr, a pivotal moment in
Islamic history, demonstrates his mastery of both movement and colour as
he continued to merge historical and spiritual narratives in his
signature style,“ Ms Mohammed says.</p>
<p>Husain was commissioned to create 99 works but could complete only 35
in his lifetime, which are now a part of the museum’s collection.</p>
<p>“The plan is to rotate these over time, allowing visitors to
experience the full breadth of his work gradually,“ Ms Mohammed
says.</p>
<p>By showing these alongside his Indian works, the museum not only
celebrates Husain’s legacy but also reframes it in a new context.</p>
<p>Though rooted in India, Husain’s worldview and work were shaped by a
broader constellation of regions and histories, Mr Khosla says.</p>
<p>“He had multiple identities simultaneously. And that layering is what
makes this project incredibly rich.“</p>
