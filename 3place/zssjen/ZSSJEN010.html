Joshua injured in Nigeria car crash that killed two team members</h4>
<p>British heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua has been injured in a car
crash in Nigeria, which killed two members of his team.</p>
<p>The former world champion was a passenger in a vehicle that collided
with a stationary truck on a major expressway in Ogun State, near
Lagos.</p>
<p>The two men who died were Joshua’s close friends and team members
Sina Ghami and Latif “Latz“ Ayodele, the boxer’s promoter Matchroom
Boxing said in a statement.</p>
<p>It added that Joshua was in a stable condition in hospital, where he
was taken for “checks and treatment“ and will remain for
observation.</p>
<p>“Our deepest condolences and prayers are with the families and
friends of all those affected - and we ask that their privacy is
respected at this incredibly difficult time,“ the Matchroom statement
said.</p>
<p>The group’s chair, boxing promoter Eddie Hearn, paid tribute to the
“two great men“ who were killed in the crash. “Rest in eternal peace
Sina and Latz. My thoughts and deepest prayers are with everyone,“ he
said.</p>
<p>Boxing expert Steve Bunce described Mr Ghami and Mr Ayodele as “two
of Joshua’s closest friends“ and as “massive parts of the Anthony Joshua
machine“.</p>
<p>“They’ve been with him, if not from the start, at least very early
on. Latz is AJ’s personal trainer and Sina is his strength and
conditioning man. They are with him all the time,“ Bunce told BBC Radio
5 Live.</p>
<p>Hours before the crash, Joshua posted a video to Instagram of himself
and Mr Ayodele playing table tennis. Mr Ghami had recently posted on
social media from Lagos.</p>
<p>A joint statement from the Ogun and Lagos state governments said
Joshua was stable and conscious, and had been in contact with his
family.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said he had spoken to the
36-year-old boxer personally to convey his condolences and wish him a
“full and speedy recovery“.</p>
<p>“AJ assured me he is re ceiving the best possible care,“ he said in a
post on X.</p>
<p>The crash took place on the busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway at around
12:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Monday.</p>
<p>The incident involved two vehicles: a black Lexus and a stationary
red commercial truck.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) said the Lexus was
“suspected to be travelling beyond the legally prescribed speed limit“,
based on preliminary findings.</p>
<p>It said the car appeared to have “lost control during an overtaking
manoeuvre“ and crashed into the stationary truck by the side of the
road.</p>
<p>Pictures shared by the FRSC showed a wrecked car at the site of the
crash, with a crowd of onlookers gathered around.</p>
<p>Local officials said Joshua and another man - the vehicle’s driver -
were rescued by the boxer’s security team.</p>
<p>Video from the scene showed the boxer being helped out from the back
seat of a wrecked SUV.</p>
<p>Ogun and Lagos state governments said Joshua and another passenger
were “immediately evacuated to a specialised medical facility in
Lagos“.</p>
<p>The Lagos-Ibadan expressway is known as one of Nigeria’s deadliest
roads, with particularly heavy traffic at this time of year as many
Nigerians living abroad visit for the festive period.</p>
<p>Joshua, who was born in Watford, has family roots in Sagamu - a town
in Ogun State, south-west Nigeria, near the crash site.</p>
<p>He had been spending time in the country following his recent</p>
<p>Paul posted on X after the crash: “Life is much more important than
boxing. I am praying for the lost lives, AJ and anyone impacted by
today’s unfortunate accident.“</p>
<p>Local police commissioner Lanre Ogunlowo said an investigation into
the accident had been ordered.</p>
<p>A relative of Joshua’s in Nigeria, who asked not to be named, told
the BBC that news of the crash came as a “shock“ to the family.</p>
<p>They said they were hoping for his “speedy recovery“ and offered
prayers for those who died in the crash.</p>
<p>The family member confirmed that Joshua was travelling from Lagos to
Ogun State when the accident happened.</p>
<p>The boxer’s family is well known in the town and traces its ancestry
there across several generations.</p>
<p>There are plans to build a new indoor boxing venue named after Joshua
in Ogun, where the boxer is a sports ambassador.</p>
