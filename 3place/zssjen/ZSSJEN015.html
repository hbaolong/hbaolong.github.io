Musk’s Grok AI image editing limited to paid users after deepfakes</h4>
<p>Elon Musk’s platform X has limited image editing with its AI tool
Grok to paying users, after it came under fire for allowing people to
make sexualised deepfakes.</p>
<p>There has been a significant backlash after the chatbot honoured
requests from users to digitally alter images of other people by
undressing them without their consent.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>backlash,英 [ˈbæklæʃ] 美 [ˈbæklæʃ]
n. （尤指对政治或社会事件的）强烈反应，反对；（机械的）反冲，反作用；（机械部件间的）间隙，轮齿隙</p></li>
<li><p>consent,英 [kənˈsent] 美 [kənˈsent]
n. 许可，允许；同意，赞同；正式批准文件，批文 v.
赞同，准许，同意</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But Grok is now telling people asking it to make such material that
only paid subscribers would be able to do so - meaning their name and
payment information must be on file.</p>
<p>The BBC has approached X for comment.</p>
<p>Those who do not subscribe can still use Grok to edit images on its
separate app and website.</p>
<p>“Musk has thrown his toys out of the pram in protest at being held to
account for the tsunami of abuse,“ said Professor Clare McGlynn, an
expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and
online abuse.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>pram,英 [præm] 美 [præm] n. <英>手推童车，婴儿车（=baby
carriage）；平底帆船，驳船；<美>（捕鱼用的）平底划艇</p></li>
<li><p>tsunami,英 [tsuːˈnɑːmi] 美 [tsuːˈnɑːmi] n. 海啸，海震</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“Instead of taking the responsible steps to ensure Grok could not be
used for abusive purposes, it has withdrawn access for the vast majority
of users.“</p>
<ul>
<li>abusive,英 [əˈbjuːsɪv] 美 [əˈbjuːsɪv] adj.
辱骂的，侮辱的；凌辱的，虐待的；受虐待的；舞弊的，不法的；滥用的</li>
</ul>
<p>And Hannah Swirsky, head of policy at the Internet Watch Foundation,
said it “does not undo the harm which has been done“.</p>
<p>“We do not believe it is good enough to simply limit access to a tool
which should never have had the capacity to create the kind of imagery
we have seen in recent days,“ she said.,</p>
<p>The charity previously said its analysts had discovered “criminal
imagery“ of girls aged between 11 and 13 which “appeared to have been
created“ using Grok.</p>
<p>“Sitting and waiting for unsafe products to be abused before taking
action is unacceptable,“ Swirsky said.</p>
<p>It comes after the government urged regulator Ofcom to use all its
powers – up to and including an effective ban – against X over concerns
about unlawful AI images created on the site.</p>
<p>Addressing concerns that sexualised images of adults and children had
been generated by Grok, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it was
“disgraceful“ and “disgusting“.</p>
<p>He said Ofcom had the government’s “full support“ to act on the
content.</p>
<p>“It’s unlawful. We’re not going to tolerate it. I’ve asked for all
options to be on the table,“ he said in an interview with Greatest Hits
Radio.</p>
<p>Government sources told BBC News: “We would expect Ofcom to use all
powers at its disposal in regard to Grok and X.“</p>
<p>Ofcom’s powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek
a court order to prevent third parties from helping the Elon Musk-owned
platform raise money or be accessed in the UK.</p>
<p>The BBC has approached the regulator for comment.</p>
<p>Grok is a free tool which users can tag directly in posts or replies
under other users’ posts to ask it for a particular response.</p>
<p>But the feature has also allowed people to request it to edit images
- and ask it to digitally strip people of most of their clothing.</p>
<p>Grok has fulfilled many user requests asking it to edit images of
women to show them in bikinis or little clothing - something those
subject to such requests have told the BBC left them feeling
“humiliated“ and “dehumanised“.</p>
<p>However as of Friday morning, Grok has told users asking it to alter
images uploaded to X that “image generation and editing are currently
limited to paying subscribers“.</p>
<p>It adds users “can subscribe to unlock these features“.</p>
<p>Some posts on the platform seen by BBC News suggest only those with a
blue tick “verified“ mark - exclusive to X’s paid subscriber tier - were
able to successfully request image edits to Grok.</p>
<p>Dr Daisy Dixon, a female X user who said she had seen an increase in
people using Grok to undress her, welcomed the change but said it felt
“like a sticking plaster“.</p>
<p>“Grok needs to be totally redesigned and have built-in ethical
guardrails to prevent this from ever happening again,“ she told the
BBC.</p>
<p>“Elon Musk also needs to acknowledge this for what it is - yet
another instance of gender-based violation.“</p>
<p>Prof McGlynn said</p>
<p>X’s move echoed its approach</p>
<p>o pornographic Taylor Swift deepfakes on the platform last year -
where it blocked searches for sexualised material generated of the
popstar using a Grok AI video feature.</p>
<p>“He is doing this to stoke free speech arguments,“ she added.</p>
<p>“He will claim regulation is stifling people’s use of this
technology. But, all the regulation requires is that he takes necessary
precautions to reduce harm.“</p>
