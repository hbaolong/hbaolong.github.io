warns of ongoing delays as services resume after Channel Tunnel power
issues</h3>
<p>Some Eurostar services have resumed after all trains from London to
Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels were cancelled due to a power outage in
the Channel Tunnel.</p>
<p>Trains that have not been cancelled will be subject to “severe delays
and possible last-minute cancellations“ following the tunnel’s partial
reopening, and passengers are advised to postpone their travel to a
different date, Eurostar said.</p>
<p>LeShuttle services - which carries road vehicles and passengers
through the tunnel between Folkestone and Calais - have also
resumed.</p>
<p>Earlier a problem with the overhead power supply and a broken down
LeShuttle train blocked all routes, causing travel chaos for thousands
trying to get away.</p>
<p>The rail operator suspended services until further notice.</p>
<p>By midday on Tuesday, at least a dozen Eurostar services between the
UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands had been cancelled.</p>
<p>The rail operator apologised and said passengers could rearrange
their plans free of charge or can cancel their booking and get a refund
or an e-voucher.</p>

<p>Passengers told the BBC how they had been left stranded and looking

</ul>
<p>Two American tourists spent hundreds of pounds to reach Paris on
Wednesday after their Eurostar service was cancelled from London St
Pancras International.</p>
<p>Haley Adams, 38, and Hannah Hagar, 35, paid 80 (£430) for flights to
the French capital to celebrate Hannah’s 36th birthday there.</p>
<p>The pair had their Eurostar tickets refunded but said they will have
to pay for an extra night at a hotel in London and cannot get a refund
from the hotel they were going to stay at in Paris tonight.</p>
<p>“There’s been a lot of queuing,“ Adams said. “We have been here for
five hours.“</p>
<p>A family from Mexico said their trip of a lifetime has been cast into
doubt as their Eurostar service was cancelled.</p>
<p>Monserrat Hernandes, her brother John Paul and mother Olga were among
dozens of people looking frantically at their phones near the Eurostar
departure area at St Pancras.</p>
<p>The family got on the Eurostar just after 08:00 GMT but after their
train left for Paris it had to return due to the incident.</p>
<p>“They say nothing is travelling today… there’s no hope for leaving
tomorrow,“ she said.</p>
<p>They are now searching for a flight or a ferry to make it to
Paris.</p>
<ul>
<li>ferry,英 [ˈferi] 美 [ˈferi] n. 渡船，摆渡；渡口 v.

</ul>
<p><strong>“It’s like an American movie,“ she added. “Hopefully I find
the love of my life.“</strong></p>
<p>In France, Ben Clark, from Bedfordshire, said he had been stuck
on-board Le Shuttle in Calais with his wife and three daughters for
hours.</p>
<p>“The first two-and-a-half hours weren’t too bad but the girls have
got restless in the last half an hour so we’ve let them run around the
boarding carriage to burn off some energy,“ he said.</p>
<p>“Some people are getting angry but there’s nothing that can be done,
others are sleeping in their cars. We have used up our snacks and now
have no plan B or C.“</p>
<p>National Rail has advised passengers not to come to London St Pancras
International if their Eurostar train is cancelled, while the Department
for Transport said disruption is “likely for the remainder of the day“
while faulty overhead cables are repaired.</p>
<p>A photograph shared with the BBC by a train driver for Eurostar
appears to show overhead electrical cables strewn across the tracks.</p>
<p>Currently only one of two main tunnels in the Channel Tunnel is
available for trains to run on, Eurostar said.</p>
<p>Eurostar’s services resumed with the 15:04 train from London to
Brussels departing after 16:00.</p>
<p>As of 18:00, only a few services to Paris Gare du Nord and Brussels
were scheduled to depart London St Pancras International this
evening.</p>
<p>The broken down LeShuttle train was also moved out of the Channel
Tunnel. The operator said none of its passengers were stranded inside
the tunnel after the power failure caused its closure.</p>
<p>LeShuttle has apologised and warned of delays of approximately five
hours, telling passengers to “please check in as planned“.</p>
<p>The LeShuttle service “resumed very gradually on one track“ shortly
before 15:00 local time (14:00 GMT), the EuroTunnel Press Office
said.</p>
<p>“Service is operating alternately in both directions with significant
delays,“ it said, adding that “additional shuttles will be added in the
evening and until tomorrow morning“.</p>
<p>Traffic has also eased on the M20 after cars hoping to cross the
Channel Tunnel caused traffic jams near the LeShuttle Terminal in
Folkestone.</p>

Energy may be changing and with it the fate of the Universe</h3>
<p>There is growing controversy over recent evidence suggesting that a
mysterious force known as dark energy might be changing in a way that
challenges our current understanding of time and space.</p>
<p>An analysis by a South Korean team has hinted that, rather than the
Universe continuing to expand, galaxies could be pulled back together by
gravity, ending in what astronomers call a “Big Crunch“.</p>
<p>The scientists involved believe that they may be on the verge of one
of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation.</p>
<p>Other astronomers have questioned these findings, but these critics
have not been able to completely dismiss the South Korean team’s
assertions.</p>
<p>Astronomers previously thought the Universe’s expansion, which began
with the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, should gradually slow
due to gravity.</p>
<p>Then evidence for dark energy was discovered in 1998 as a force
accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Studies of very bright
exploding stars called supernovas showed that rather than slowing down,
distant galaxies were actually accelerating away from each other.</p>
<p>Some theories suggested that this ever‑accelerating Universe could
first spread the stars so far apart that almost nothing would be visible
in the night sky and, more shockingly, might eventually tear even atoms
themselves apart in a “Big Rip“.</p>
<p>The controversy began in March with unexpected results from an
instrument on a telescope in the Arizona desert called the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (Desi).</p>
<p>Desi was built to discover more about dark energy. It tracked the
acceleration of millions of galaxies in exquisite detail, but
astronomers were not expecting the results it came up with.</p>
<p>The data hinted that acceleration of the galaxies had changed over
time, something not in line with the standard picture, according to Prof
Ofer Lahav of University College London, who is involved with the Desi
project.</p>
<p>“Now with this changing dark energy going up and then down, again, we
need a new mechanism. And this could be a shake up for the whole of
physics,“ he says.</p>
<p>Then in November the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) published
research from a South Korean team that seems to back the view that the
weirdness of dark energy is weirder still.</p>
<p>Prof Young Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team went
back to the kind of supernova data that first revealed dark energy 27
years ago. Instead of treating these stellar explosions as having one
standard brightness, they adjusted for the ages of the galaxies they
came from and worked out how bright the supernovas really were.</p>
<p>This adjustment showed that not only had dark energy changed over
time, but, shockingly, that the acceleration was slowing down.</p>
<p>“The fate of the Universe will change,“ Prof Lee tells BBC News
starkly.</p>
<p>“If dark energy is not constant and it’s getting weakened, this will
change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology.“</p>
<p>If, as Prof Lee’s results suggest, the force that is pushing galaxies
away from each other - dark energy - is weakening, then one possibility
is that it becomes so weak that gravity begins to pull the galaxies back
together.</p>
<p>“Rather than ending with a Big Rip, a Big Crunch is now a
possibility.</p>
<p>“Which outcome wins, depends on the true nature of dark energy, for
which we still do not know the answer,“ says Prof Lee.</p>
<p>Prof Lee’s work has been checked by fellow experts and published in a
respected journal of the RAS. But his claims have not gone down at all
well with many senior astronomers working in the field, such as Prof
George Efstathiou of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge
University.</p>
<p>“I think that this is just reflecting the messy details of
supernovas,“ he says. “The correlation with age is not very tight, so I
think it is dangerous to apply a ‘correction’. It looks weak to me.“</p>
<p>The mainstream view is that the Universe is still accelerating with
almost unchanging dark energy.</p>
<p>But Prof Lee pushes back strongly on such criticisms.</p>
<p>“Our data is based on 300 galaxies. The statistical significance is
roughly one-in-a-trillion chance of being a fluke. So, I strongly feel
that already our research is very, very significant.“</p>
<p>Since the South Korean results, two teams have reassessed the
brightness of some of the supernovas. They looked at an earlier study
that fed into the Desi results from March which began the whole hoo-hah.
They did so to double-check the March results because the claim that
dark energy was changing was so controversial.</p>
<p>Both teams have pulled back slightly from the original hints, but the
hints have not gone away, even after extensive scrutiny.</p>
<p>Consequently there will continue to be passionate, sometimes
contentious, debate over whether the cosmos is gently whispering to us
about its true nature, or whether astronomers are chasing celestial
ghosts.</p>
<p>Hundreds of scientific papers have been published on the subject and
astronomers are split on what they think is the best explanation. This
is no bad thing, according to Prof Robert Massey, who is RAS’s Deputy
Director.</p>
<p>“Who doesn’t want to understand how the universe is going to end and
how it began?“ he says. “Human beings have always been interested in
that, whether you take it from a religious perspective or a scientific
one.</p>
<p>“Being able to think, okay, this is how things will end in many, many
billions of years, wouldn’t that be extraordinary?“</p>

losses in Ukraine rise faster than ever, as US pushes for peace
deal</h3>
<p>Over the past 10 months, Russian losses in the war with Ukraine have
been growing faster than any time since the start of the full-scale
invasion in 2022, BBC analysis suggests.</p>
<ul>
<li>invasion,英 [ɪnˈveɪʒ(ə)n] 美 [ɪnˈveɪʒ(ə)n]
n. 侵略，入侵；涌入，大批进入；侵犯，干预；侵袭，扩散</li>
</ul>
<p>As peace efforts intensified in 2025 under pressure from US President
Donald Trump’s administration, 40% more obituaries of soldiers were
published in Russian sources compared with the previous year.</p>
<ul>
<li>obituary,英 [əˈbɪtʃuəri] 美 [oʊˈbɪtʃueri] n. （报纸上的）讣告，讣文
adj. 讣告的</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people
killed fighting on Russia’s side in Ukraine.</p>
<p>BBC News Russian has been counting Russian war losses together with
independent outlet Mediazona and a group of volunteers since February
2022. We keep a list of named individuals whose deaths we were able to
confirm using official reports, newspapers, social media, and new
memorials and graves.</p>
<p>The real death toll is believed to be much higher, and military
experts we have consulted believe our analysis of cemeteries, war
memorials and obituaries might represent 45-65% of the total.</p>
<ul>
<li>toll,英 [təʊl] 美 [toʊl]
n. （道路、桥梁等的）通行费；<美>长途电话费；（事故、灾难、战争等的）伤亡人数；严重的不良影响；（缓慢的）钟声
v.
（缓慢地）敲（钟），鸣（钟）；鸣钟告知；收取（桥梁或道路的）通行费</li>
</ul>
<p>That would put the number of Russian deaths at between 243,000 and
352,000.</p>
<p>The number of obituaries for any given period is a preliminary
estimate of the confirmed losses, as some need additional verification
and will eventually be discarded. But it can indicate how the intensity
of fighting is changing over time.</p>
<p>2025 starts with a relatively low number of published obituaries in
January, compared with the previous months. Then the number rises in
February, when Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin talked
directly for the first time about ending the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The next peak in August coincides with the two presidents meeting
each other in Alaska, a diplomatic coup for Putin that was widely seen
as an end to his international isolation.</p>
<p>In October, when a planned second Russia-US summit was eventually
shelved, and then in November, when the US presented a 28-point peace
proposal, an average of 322 obituaries were published per day - twice
the average in 2024.</p>
<p>It is difficult to put increased Russian losses down to any one
factor, but the Kremlin sees territorial gains as a way of influencing
negotiations with the US in its favour: Putin aide Yuri Ushakov stressed
recently that “recent successes“ had had a positive impact.</p>
<p>Murat Mukashev was among those who gambled on a quick peace deal, and
it cost him his life.</p>
<p>Mukashev was an activist who had never supported Putin’s
policies.</p>
<p>Over the years, he had taken part in demonstrations against police
violence and torture, and joined rallies for LGBT rights and the release
of Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin’s main opponent who died in prison in
2024.</p>
<p>He had repeatedly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on social
media from 2022. Then, in early 2024, Mukashev was detained near his
home in Moscow and charged with large-scale drug dealing.</p>
<p>While his case was being tried he was offered a contract with the
defence ministry, according to his friends and family.</p>
<p>They saw the heavy charges levelled against him as a typical ploy to
get people to sign up. A 2024 law allows the accused a way out of a
criminal conviction if they join up - an attractive option in a country
with an acquittal rate of less than 1%.</p>
<p>Mukashev refused the offer, and the court sentenced him to 10 years
in a high-security penal colony.</p>
<p>In prison in November 2024, he changed his mind. Friends said he was
encouraged by Trump’s promises to end the war quickly and decided he
needed to sign up as soon as possible to secure his release before a
peace deal was reached.</p>
<p>“He saw this as a chance to be released instead of being imprisoned
for 10 years of strict regime,“ reads a statement from his support
group.</p>
<p>There was no explanation of how he reconciled taking part in the war
with his reluctance to kill.</p>
<p>On June 11 2025, Mukashev died fighting as part of an assault squad
in the Kharkiv region of north-eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Like him, the majority of Russians killed at the front in 2025 had
nothing to do with the military at the start of the full-scale war, BBC
figures show.</p>
<p>But since the bloody battle for the city of Avdiivka in October 2023,
there has been a steady increase in casualties among so-called
“volunteers“ - those who have voluntarily signed a contract since the
start of the invasion.</p>
<p>They now appear to form the majority of Russia’s new recruits, as
opposed to professional soldiers who joined the army before the invasion
or those mobilised for military service afterwards.</p>
<p>A year ago 15% of Russian military deaths were volunteers, but in
2025 it was one in three.</p>
<p>Local governments, under pressure to maintain a constant flow of new
recruits, advertise hefty pay-outs, meet people who have large debts and
campaign in universities and colleges.</p>
<p>This means that the Kremlin has been able to compensate for heavy
losses at the front while avoiding the politically risky move of a
large-scale mandatory mobilisation.</p>
<p>By October, 336,000 people had signed up for the military this year,
according to National Security Council deputy chief Dmitry Medvedev -
well over 30,000 a month.</p>
<p>Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte has since said that 25,000 Russian
soldiers are being killed every month. If both are right, Russia is
still recruiting more soldiers than it is losing.</p>
<p>Based on obituaries and relatives’ accounts, most of those who signed
up to fight did so voluntarily; but there are reports of pressure and
coercion, especially on regular conscripts and those charged with
criminal offences.</p>
<p>Some recruits mistakenly believe that after they have signed up for a
year they can return to their old life with money in their pockets.</p>
<p>A new recruit can earn up to 10m roubles (£95,000; 28,000) in a year.
In reality all contracts signed with the defence ministry since
September 2022 are automatically renewed until the war is over.</p>
<p>According to Nato, the total number of Russian dead and wounded in
the war is 1.1 million, and one official has estimated there have been
250,000 fatalities.</p>
<p>This is in line with the BBC’s calculations, although our list does
not include those killed serving in the militia of two occupied regions
in eastern Ukraine, which we estimate to be between 21,000 and 23,500
fighters.</p>
<p>Ukraine has also sustained heavy losses.</p>
<p>Last February, President Volodymyr Zelensky put the number of
battlefield deaths at 46,000 and 380,000 others wounded.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands more were either missing in action or held captive,
he added.</p>
<p>Based on other estimates and cross-referencing data, we believe the
number of Ukrainians killed by now is as high as 140,000.</p>

hopes to reach phase two of Gaza ceasefire ‘very quickly’</h3>
<p>Donald Trump said he hoped to reach phase two of the Gaza peace plan
“very quickly“, as he warned Hamas would have “hell to pay“ if it did
not disarm quickly.</p>
<p>The US president, whose 20-point peace plan requires the militant
group to disarm, made the comments as he met Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida for talks on Monday.</p>
<p>During a press conference with Netanyahu after their meeting, Trump
said Israel had “lived up to the plan 100%“, despite continuing attacks
by its military in Gaza.</p>
<p>The US president also said his country could support another major
strike on Iran were it to resume rebuilding its ballistic missile or
nuclear weapons programmes.</p>
<p>Asked how quickly Hamas and Israel should move to phase two of the
peace plan, Trump said: “As quickly as we can. But there has to be
disarmament.“</p>
<p>Speaking about Hamas, he said: “If they don’t disarm as, as they
agreed to do, they agreed to it, and then there will be hell to pay for
them.</p>
<p>“They have to disarm in a fairly short period of time“.</p>
<p>Trump also said reconstruction in Gaza could “begin pretty soon“.</p>
<p>The Gaza peace plan came into effect in October. Under the second
phase, a technocratic government would be established in the devastated
territory, Hamas would disarm and Israeli troops would withdraw. The
reconstruction of Gaza would then begin.</p>
<p>But critics have suggested Netanyahu could seek to delay the process
of the plan and instead push for Hamas to disarm before Israeli troops
withdraw.</p>
<p>The Israeli prime minister has been accused of not wanting to engage
seriously with the issue of a political future for Palestinians.</p>
<p>Hamas officials have said a full disarmament should take place
alongside progress towards an independent Palestinian state.</p>
<p>Asked if he was concerned Israel was not moving quickly enough to
phase two of the plan, Trump said it had “lived up to the plan“.</p>
<p>“I’m not concerned about anything that Israel’s doing, I’m concerned
about what other people are doing or maybe aren’t doing,“ he added.</p>
<p>Since the ceasefire came into effect, at least 414 Palestinians have
been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run
health ministry.</p>
<p>The Israeli military, which controls more than half of Gaza, has said
it has only opened fire in response to ceasefire violations. It has
blamed Hamas for the killings of three Israeli soldiers over the same
period.</p>
<p>During the press briefing, Trump also warned that the US would launch
further attacks on Iran if it was found to be using different sites to
develop nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>In June, Trump claimed US air and missile strikes “obliterated“
Iran’s nuclear facilities. Iran has denied seeking to develop nuclear
weapons.</p>
<p>“I hope they’re not trying to build up again, because if they are
we’re going to have no choice but to eradicate that build up,“ he
said.</p>
<p>Trump said he “had been reading“ that the country was using “possibly
different sites“ to those targeted in summer.</p>
<p>Iran, which fought a 12-day war with Israel in June, on Monday
denounced the reports as a “psychological operation“ against Tehran.</p>
<p>It said it was fully prepared to defend itself, and warned renewed
aggression would “result in harsher consequences“ for Israel.</p>
<p>Trump and Netanyahu’s talks also focused on other regional tension
points, including Syria and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel was keen to ensure a peaceful
border with Syria, and Trump said he hoped Israel would get along with
President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who took power after longtime strongman
Bashar al-Assad was deposed last year.</p>
<p>Israel has been suspicious of the new leader, who was once a member
of al-Qaeda, and bombed government buildings in Damascus in July.</p>
<p>“Well, I hope he’s [Netanyahu] going to get along with Syria because
the new president of Syria is working very hard to do a good job,“ Trump
said.</p>
<p>“He really is. I know he’s a tough cookie. And, you know, you’re not
going to get a choir boy to lead Syria.“</p>
<p>Trump signed an executive order in June to end US sanctions against
Syria.</p>

6 Siege: Game back online as Ubisoft works to fix issues</h3>
<p>Ubisoft, one of the world’s largest games developers, says it’s
working to fix an apparent hack on popular online shooter Rainbow Six
Siege.</p>
<p>Servers for the tactical multiplayer game were taken offline on
Saturday and Sunday after in-game currency thought to be worth millions
of pounds was distributed to players.</p>
<p>The company has since restored service, but suspended the game’s
marketplace until further notice and warned players they may face queues
when trying to log on.</p>
<p>In a</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege, commonly referred to as R6, has been a success
story for Ubisoft, which is also behind the Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry
series.</p>
<p>The game has a steady base of regular players and its own dedicated
esports tournaments.</p>
<p>It’s currently free to play, but generates income for the company
through in-game purchases of cosmetic items via its online
marketplace.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has not officially described the weekend’s incident as a
hack, but did acknowledge issues that affected the game over the
weekend.</p>
<p>According to reports, R6 players were each sent 2 billion credits -
estimated to be worth 3.3m (£9.9m) if they’d been bought
legitimately.</p>
<p>Screenshots also showed messages containing defamatory statements
appearing for some users.</p>
<p>In response, Ubisoft shut down its R6 servers and began to work on a
“roll back“ - essentially rewinding the clock so any purchases made
prior to Saturday could be undone.</p>
<p>The company said any irregular messages were not sent by its team
members, and added that no-one would be banned for spending credits they
had received.</p>
<p>Journalist James Lucas, who has been covering the story for
website</p>
<p>“You could empty the store a dozen times over,“ says James.</p>
<p>James adds that the timing of the outage, during the lucrative
Christmas period, comes at a particularly bad time for Ubisoft.</p>
<p>“We talk about Christmas noobs, people who get the game for the first
time over the holidays,“ says James.</p>
<p>“The marketplace is disabled, so there’s no way to buy in-game items
any more.</p>
<p>“All of that money is sitting on the table now because they can’t
spend anything on the game.“</p>
<p>Long-term players are also affected, says James, with some still
missing purchased items.</p>
<p>“I think it shows a really big vulnerability,“ says James.</p>
<p>“If a hacker can gain access to your backends, even with a backup,
your game or at least your marketplace could go offline for weeks.“</p>
<p>James added that reports of a wider attack, with hackers gaining
access to data linked to unreleased Ubisoft games, appeared to be
untrue.</p>
<p>Gaming hacks are relatively rare but there have been some
high-profile examples.</p>

energy: India’s renewable energy boom faces a hidden waste problem</h3>
<p>India’s rapid solar energy expansion is widely hailed as a success.
But without a plan to manage the waste it will generate, how clean is
the transition?</p>
<p>In just over a decade, India has become the world’s third-largest
solar producer, with renewables now central to its climate strategy.
Solar panels are everywhere - from vast solar parks to blue rooftops
across cities, towns and villages.</p>
<p>Alongside large solar parks, millions of rooftop systems now feed
power into the electricity grid. Government data show nearly 2.4 million
households have adopted solar under a subsidy scheme.</p>
<p>Solar growth has cut India’s reliance on coal. Though thermal and
other non-renewables still supply over half of installed capacity, solar
now contributes more than 20%. Yet the achievement carries a challenge:
while clean in use, solar panels can pose environmental risks if not
properly managed.</p>
<p>Solar panels are mostly recyclable, made of glass, aluminium, silver,
and polymers - but trace toxic metals like lead and cadmium can pollute
soil and water if mishandled.</p>
<p>Solar panels typically last about 25 years, after which they are
removed and discarded. India currently has no dedicated budget for
solar-waste recycling and only a few small facilities to process old
panels.</p>
<p>India has no official data on solar waste, but a study estimated
around 100,000 tonnes by 2023, rising to 600,000 tonnes by 2030. For
now, the volume is small, but experts warn the bulk is yet to come - and
without rapid recycling investment, India could face a growing waste
crisis.</p>
<p>A new study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW)
estimates that India could generate more than</p>
<p>“Most of India’s large solar parks were built in the mid-2010s, so
the real wave of waste is coming in 10 to 15 years,“ says Rohit Pahwa of
energy company Targray.</p>
<p>India’s solar-waste projections mirror global patterns: the</p>
<p>The policy landscape, however, differs significantly.</p>
<p>In the US, solar-panel recycling is mostly market-driven under a
patchwork of state rules. China’s system, like India’s, is still
developing and lacks a dedicated regulatory framework.</p>
<p>In 2022, India brought solar panels under e-waste rules, making
manufacturers responsible for collecting, storing, dismantling and
recycling them at end of life.</p>
<p>Experts say enforcement is uneven, especially for home and
small-scale panels, which make up 5–10% of installations. Though modest,
these panels can still generate substantial waste, as they are harder to
track, collect, and recycle.</p>
<p>Damaged or discarded panels often end up in landfills or with
unauthorised recyclers, where unsafe methods can release toxic
materials. The BBC has contacted India’s renewable energy ministry for
comment.</p>
<p>“Solar power gives an illusion of clean energy for two decades, but
without a serious plan for recycling panels it risks leaving behind a
graveyard of modules and not much of a legacy,“ says environment expert
Sai Bhaskar Reddy Nakka.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, experts say the problem is not without
opportunities.</p>
<p>“As waste rises, so will the demand for companies that know how to
process it,“ Mr Pahwa says.</p>
<p>Efficient recycling could reclaim 38% of materials for new panels by
2047 and prevent 37 million tonnes of carbon emissions from mining, says
CEEW.</p>
<p>India already has markets for glass and aluminium, and metals found
in solar cells - silicon, silver, and copper - can be recovered for new
panels or other industries, says Akansha Tyagi, co-author of the
study.</p>
<p>Currently, most solar waste is processed with basic methods that
recover only low-value materials like glass and aluminium, while
precious metals are lost, damaged or extracted in tiny amounts.</p>
<p>Experts say the next decade will be decisive for India’s solar goals.
The country must act fast - building a regulated, self-sustaining
recycling system, raising household awareness, and integrating waste
collection into solar business models.</p>
<p>Companies that profit from solar power should also be responsible for
what happens to panels once they stop working, says Mr Nakka.</p>
<p>“Without proper recycling, clean energy today could mean more waste
tomorrow,“ he warned.</p>

accuses Cambodia of breaking newly signed ceasefire</h3>
<p>Thailand’s army has accused Cambodia of breaching a newly signed
ceasefire deal reached after weeks of deadly clashes that forced nearly
one million people from their homes.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Thai army said more than 250 unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian side on Sunday
night.</p>
<p>The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday.
Both sides agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban
reinforcements and allow civilians living in border areas to return as
soon as possible.</p>
<p>It had been seen as a breakthrough, which came after days of talks
between both countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the
US.</p>
<p>In a statement on Monday, the Royal Thai Army said Cambodia’s actions
“constitute provocation and a violation of measures aimed at reducing
tensions“, adding that they were “inconsistent“ with the terms of the
ceasefire.</p>
<p>It also said it “may need to reconsider“ the release of 18 Cambodian
soldiers held in Thailand since July.</p>
<p>Thailand would be “obliged to act in accordance… [if] violations of
agreements and national sovereignty continue“, it added.</p>
<p>Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn described the incident as “a
small issue related to flying drones seen by both sides along the border
line,“ according to AFP news agency.</p>
<p>It comes just hours after China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi praised
the “hard-won“ ceasefire, and US President Donald Trump praised the
“rapid and fair conclusion“.</p>
<p>The latest tensions ramped up earlier this year, after a group of
Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.</p>
<p>A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May. This plunged
relations between the countries to their lowest point in more than a
decade.</p>
<p>There were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left
dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were
displaced.</p>
<p>A fragile ceasefire deal was agreed in July and signed in October. It
then collapsed earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted.</p>
<p>Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.</p>

words from my Dad that saved me as a new parent</h3>
<p>Former Made In Chelsea star Ryan Libbey expected to cope with the
challenges of becoming a dad.</p>
<p>But the reality quickly became “very different“ to what he’d
imagined.</p>
<p>Life-threatening health complications around the birth saw his
partner Louise hospitalised. Suddenly he was thrust into becoming her
primary caregiver as well as looking after their newborn son Leo.</p>
<p>“I was doing every night time, every change… every walk. The role of
both mum and dad,“ Ryan</p>
<p>After 11 months he burnt out. It was a chat with his own dad, on a
park bench, that made him realise he needed help.</p>
<p>The simple words “You’re not in a good spot. You need some help. How
can I help you?“ opened the door for Ryan to speak honestly, seek
support and find a way back.</p>
<p>His experience is not uncommon, but rarely discussed. While society
is now better used to talking about the strain on mums and about
post-natal depression, less is said about the struggles dads face.</p>
<p>According to the government’s</p>
<p>Ryan feels his struggles are part of a wider failure to communicate
amongst men, who still internalise harmful perceptions of
masculinity.</p>
<p>Men, he says, often feel they must be “the harbour wall that just
gets smashed and remains standing every time.“</p>
<p>“It’s not a show of weakness to ask for help. I didn’t do that quick
enough,“ he explains.</p>
<p>Clinical psychologist Dr Jill Domoney, a researcher specialising in
mental health pre and post childbirth, says men often don’t want to
accept they’re struggling.</p>
<p>They can feel they are “not a legitimate person to be asking for
help“ - especially ahead of a mum and baby - but she emphasises their
mental well-being is just as important to the family.</p>
<p>Ryan’s conversation with his dad gave him the space to ask for a
break - taking a few days abroad, away from the home environment, to
gain perspective.</p>
<p>He realised he needed to make a shift to focus on his and his
partner’s emotions as well as the practical tasks of taking care of a
new baby.</p>
<p>When he opened up to Louise, he realised he’d missed “what she was
yearning“ -holding her hand and listening to her.</p>
<p>That realisation has reshaped how Ryan sees fatherhood.</p>
<p>He’s now writing Leo weekly letters about his experiences as a dad,
which he hopes his son will read as he gets older.</p>
<p>Ryan hopes these will help his son better understand the language of
emotion and make sense of his parenting choices.</p>
<p>The idea of “self-parenting“ is something rapper and songwriter
Professor Green - real name Stephen Manderson - has also felt keenly
since fathering his son Slimane, who is now four.</p>
<p>As a child Stephen lacked consistent male parenting. Despite having
an “incredible“ bond with his dad, deep-held trauma meant his father
struggled to cope and was “in and out“ of his life, complicating their
relationship.</p>
<p>Stephen says suppressing feelings led him to make “terrible
decisions“ when younger to alter how he felt, finding solace in drink
and drugs as escapism from the pain.</p>
<p>“You find your way to things that don’t help,“ he explains. “They may
temporarily change how you feel, but they will ultimately make things
worse.“</p>
<p>When his father later died by suicide, Stephen understandably
struggled to accept the loss, having not spoken to him for years.</p>
<p>As a dad now, Stephen’s determined not to “perpetuate the cycle“ with
his own son and instead offer the security and emotional guidance he
missed out on.</p>
<p>When his son threatens to have a tantrum, for example, they practise
“shaking it out“ together - processing the emotions safely.</p>
<p>Both Ryan and Stephen say they have become better, healthier men
because they faced their pain, changed how they communicate, and learned
to regulate themselves for their kids.</p>
<p>“I’m better… sitting with things and dealing with things,“ says
Stephen.</p>
<p>“I wrote that in a letter to Leo last week,“ Ryan says. “I said, at
times I feel like my role is to instruct and tell you what to do, but
actually, it’s a two-way conversation. I’m learning just as much as you
are in this journey.“</p>

<p>It added that Joshua was in a stable condition in hospital, where he
was taken for “checks and treatment“ and will remain for
observation.</p>
<p>“Our deepest condolences and prayers are with the families and
friends of all those affected - and we ask that their privacy is
respected at this incredibly difficult time,“ the Matchroom statement
said.</p>
<p>The group’s chair, boxing promoter Eddie Hearn, paid tribute to the
“two great men“ who were killed in the crash. “Rest in eternal peace
Sina and Latz. My thoughts and deepest prayers are with everyone,“ he
said.</p>
<p>Boxing expert Steve Bunce described Mr Ghami and Mr Ayodele as “two
of Joshua’s closest friends“ and as “massive parts of the Anthony Joshua
machine“.</p>
<p>“They’ve been with him, if not from the start, at least very early
on. Latz is AJ’s personal trainer and Sina is his strength and
conditioning man. They are with him all the time,“ Bunce told BBC Radio
5 Live.</p>
<p>Hours before the crash, Joshua posted a video to Instagram of himself
and Mr Ayodele playing table tennis. Mr Ghami had recently posted on
social media from Lagos.</p>
<p>A joint statement from the Ogun and Lagos state governments said
Joshua was stable and conscious, and had been in contact with his
family.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said he had spoken to the
36-year-old boxer personally to convey his condolences and wish him a
“full and speedy recovery“.</p>
<p>“AJ assured me he is re ceiving the best possible care,“ he said in a
post on X.</p>
<p>The crash took place on the busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway at around
12:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Monday.</p>
<p>The incident involved two vehicles: a black Lexus and a stationary
red commercial truck.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) said the Lexus was
“suspected to be travelling beyond the legally prescribed speed limit“,
based on preliminary findings.</p>
<p>It said the car appeared to have “lost control during an overtaking
manoeuvre“ and crashed into the stationary truck by the side of the
road.</p>
<p>Pictures shared by the FRSC showed a wrecked car at the site of the
crash, with a crowd of onlookers gathered around.</p>
<p>Local officials said Joshua and another man - the vehicle’s driver -
were rescued by the boxer’s security team.</p>
<p>Video from the scene showed the boxer being helped out from the back
seat of a wrecked SUV.</p>
<p>Ogun and Lagos state governments said Joshua and another passenger
were “immediately evacuated to a specialised medical facility in
Lagos“.</p>
<p>The Lagos-Ibadan expressway is known as one of Nigeria’s deadliest
roads, with particularly heavy traffic at this time of year as many
Nigerians living abroad visit for the festive period.</p>
<p>Joshua, who was born in Watford, has family roots in Sagamu - a town
in Ogun State, south-west Nigeria, near the crash site.</p>
<p>He had been spending time in the country following his recent</p>
<p>Paul posted on X after the crash: “Life is much more important than
boxing. I am praying for the lost lives, AJ and anyone impacted by
today’s unfortunate accident.“</p>
<p>Local police commissioner Lanre Ogunlowo said an investigation into
the accident had been ordered.</p>
<p>A relative of Joshua’s in Nigeria, who asked not to be named, told
the BBC that news of the crash came as a “shock“ to the family.</p>
<p>They said they were hoping for his “speedy recovery“ and offered
prayers for those who died in the crash.</p>
<p>The family member confirmed that Joshua was travelling from Lagos to
Ogun State when the accident happened.</p>
<p>The boxer’s family is well known in the town and traces its ancestry
there across several generations.</p>
<p>There are plans to build a new indoor boxing venue named after Joshua
in Ogun, where the boxer is a sports ambassador.</p>

energy: India’s renewable energy boom faces a hidden waste problem</h3>
<p>India’s rapid solar energy expansion is widely hailed as a success.
But without a plan to manage the waste it will generate, how clean is
the transition?</p>
<p>In just over a decade, India has become the world’s third-largest
solar producer, with renewables now central to its climate strategy.
Solar panels are everywhere - from vast solar parks to blue rooftops
across cities, towns and villages.</p>
<p>Alongside large solar parks, millions of rooftop systems now feed
power into the electricity grid. Government data show nearly 2.4 million
households have adopted solar under a subsidy scheme.</p>
<p>Solar growth has cut India’s reliance on coal. Though thermal and
other non-renewables still supply over half of installed capacity, solar
now contributes more than 20%. Yet the achievement carries a challenge:
while clean in use, solar panels can pose environmental risks if not
properly managed.</p>
<p>Solar panels are mostly recyclable, made of glass, aluminium, silver,
and polymers - but trace toxic metals like lead and cadmium can pollute
soil and water if mishandled.</p>
<p>Solar panels typically last about 25 years, after which they are
removed and discarded. India currently has no dedicated budget for
solar-waste recycling and only a few small facilities to process old
panels.</p>
<p>India has no official data on solar waste, but a study estimated
around 100,000 tonnes by 2023, rising to 600,000 tonnes by 2030. For
now, the volume is small, but experts warn the bulk is yet to come - and
without rapid recycling investment, India could face a growing waste
crisis.</p>
<p>A new study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW)
estimates that India could generate more than</p>
<p>“Most of India’s large solar parks were built in the mid-2010s, so
the real wave of waste is coming in 10 to 15 years,“ says Rohit Pahwa of
energy company Targray.</p>
<p>India’s solar-waste projections mirror global patterns: the</p>
<p>The policy landscape, however, differs significantly.</p>
<p>In the US, solar-panel recycling is mostly market-driven under a
patchwork of state rules. China’s system, like India’s, is still
developing and lacks a dedicated regulatory framework.</p>
<p>In 2022, India brought solar panels under e-waste rules, making
manufacturers responsible for collecting, storing, dismantling and
recycling them at end of life.</p>
<p>Experts say enforcement is uneven, especially for home and
small-scale panels, which make up 5–10% of installations. Though modest,
these panels can still generate substantial waste, as they are harder to
track, collect, and recycle.</p>
<p>Damaged or discarded panels often end up in landfills or with
unauthorised recyclers, where unsafe methods can release toxic
materials. The BBC has contacted India’s renewable energy ministry for
comment.</p>
<p>“Solar power gives an illusion of clean energy for two decades, but
without a serious plan for recycling panels it risks leaving behind a
graveyard of modules and not much of a legacy,“ says environment expert
Sai Bhaskar Reddy Nakka.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, experts say the problem is not without
opportunities.</p>
<p>“As waste rises, so will the demand for companies that know how to
process it,“ Mr Pahwa says.</p>
<p>Efficient recycling could reclaim 38% of materials for new panels by
2047 and prevent 37 million tonnes of carbon emissions from mining, says
CEEW.</p>
<p>India already has markets for glass and aluminium, and metals found
in solar cells - silicon, silver, and copper - can be recovered for new
panels or other industries, says Akansha Tyagi, co-author of the
study.</p>
<p>Currently, most solar waste is processed with basic methods that
recover only low-value materials like glass and aluminium, while
precious metals are lost, damaged or extracted in tiny amounts.</p>
<p>Experts say the next decade will be decisive for India’s solar goals.
The country must act fast - building a regulated, self-sustaining
recycling system, raising household awareness, and integrating waste
collection into solar business models.</p>
<p>Companies that profit from solar power should also be responsible for
what happens to panels once they stop working, says Mr Nakka.</p>
<p>“Without proper recycling, clean energy today could mean more waste
tomorrow,“ he warned.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump has long opposed wind energy, saying it is
unreliable and drives up costs, and attempted to stop all projects when
he returned to office. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has said wind
farms have no future in the US energy grid.</p>
<p>Renewable energy companies, as well as state leaders, have expressed

<p>The five wind farms now on pause are being constructed off the coast

<p>Specifically, the announcement noted that officials are concerned

<p>The wind projects could make it difficult to “determine what’s friend

statement.</p>
<p>Dominion saw its share price drop more than 3% after the
announcement.</p>
<p>Orsted, the Danish wind energy giant, recorded a 12% drop in its
share price, while turbine maker Vestas’ stock fell by 2.6%.</p>
<p>Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, a Democrat, described the pause as
an “erratic“ move that “will drive up the price of electricity in
Connecticut and throughout the region“.</p>
<p>“This project is nearing completion and providing good-paying clean
energy jobs,“ he added. “Businesses and residents deserve economic
predictability, yet with the administration’s constant starts and stops
they’re left with the opposite.“</p>
<p>Earlier in December, a federal judge struck down an attempt by
President Trump to ban new wind power projects in the US, calling it
“arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law“.</p>
<p>On the first day of his administration in January, Trump issued a
memorandum halting permits and new leases until a federal review could
be undertaken.</p>
<p>Five months later, 17 US states led by New York sued the
administration, calling the ban an “existential“ threat to the US wind
industry.</p>

about using AI for festive swim tide time advice</h3>
<ul>
<li>tide,英 [taɪd] 美 [taɪd]

<p>Thousands of people will take to the waters around the UK over the
festive season at organised swims that have been held for decades.</p>
<p>But those going it alone may want to heed Maritime and Coastguard
Agency warnings not to rely on AI tools when planning outdoor activities
as it can make mistakes.</p>
<p>The advice comes after two people became stranded on Sully Island,
near Barry, after ChatGPT gave them the wrong tide times and they had to
be rescued by the coastguard.</p>
<p><strong>The warning echoes advice from a top tech industry chief not
to “blindly trust“ everything AI tells people.</strong></p>
<p>The chief executive of Google’s parent company Alphabet, Sundar
Pichai, recently said</p>
<p>Does this incident show people would be wise to be wary of AI?</p>
<p>One of the rescued men thinks so.</p>
<p>He told social media news channel</p>
<p>The AI programme said low tide would be at 09:30, meaning their early
morning departure should have given sufficient time to walk over and
back to the island.</p>
<p>But the information was wrong by two hours and the causeway was
underwater when they attempted to return.</p>
<p>“Some false information there, but maybe a lesson learned for me,“ he
said.</p>
<p>HM Coastguard said: “While AI tools can be very useful, they draw
from a wide range of sources to gather information and responses which
may not be correct for a specific location or area.“</p>
<p>It recommended resources such as the UK Hydrographic Office’s</p>
<p>Information on tide times is easily available online - a search
engine will throw up multiple websites all giving the same, correct
information.</p>
<p>However, when the BBC asked ChatGPT the same question as the unlucky
visitors, it generated exactly the same, incorrect, response.</p>
<p>On another attempt it was out by five hours.</p>
<p>Open AI, which owns ChatGPT, said improving factual accuracy was a
“significant focus“ for the industry, and new models had significantly
fewer</p>
<p>Prof Steven Schockaert, head of the AI and data analytics research
section at Cardiff University’s school of computer science, said in this
instance the problem may lie with how the information is presented
online.</p>
<p>“I think the issue here is that the tide tables are shown in a table,
and the model struggles with extracting the correct value from the
table,“ he explains.</p>
<p>“Traditionally tables have been quite challenging for language models
because they’ve been trained on language, so words [written] left to
right. Tables don’t have that kind of structure.“</p>
<p><strong>He advises people to stick to asking AI for information that
you can verify yourself, such as drafting emails.</strong></p>
<p>“But if you ask it for factual information then you don’t have any
guarantee of whether it’s going to be correct or not.</p>
<p>“<strong>I think it’s probably not a good idea to rely on them for
information that you can’t verify and that’s somehow important, like in
this case the tides.</strong>“</p>
<p>Sam Skyrme-Blackhall chairs Tenby Sea Swim Association, which runs
the Boxing Day event.</p>
<p>She swims year-round and knows the challenges the water presents.</p>
<p>For the organised event, there are multiple safety measures in place,
with marshals on the beach, surf lifesavers and the RNLI out at sea to
watch festive dippers.</p>
<p>On land, St John Ambulance provides medical backup.</p>
<p>However, she believes things like picture-perfect social media
portrayals of the coast can make people overestimate what they are
capable of.</p>
<p>“It’s like a storybook, isn’t it? It’s all glossy but the reality is
there are hidden dangers.</p>
<p>“These are tidal beaches - I check the tide times weekly to see where
I am but also check the conditions.</p>
<p>“<strong>Listen to the professionals. Listen to the local people who
have the knowledge.</strong>“</p>
<h5 id="好察迩言"><a href="./hash/0013.html">好察迩言</a></h5>
<p><strong>Sometimes AI can both help and hinder trips to the
outdoors.</strong></p>
<p>Aberdyfi Search and Rescue Team rescued two walkers who had used AI
to plan their excursion up Cader Idris near Dolgellau, the highest peak
in southern Eryri - also called Snowdonia.</p>
<p>Team leader Phil Britton and deputy leader Gareth Davies have over 50
years of experience between them, and were part of the rescue group.</p>
<p>The pair told Phil they had used AI to check the weather and for
equipment suggestions - unfortunately, it was the day</p>
<p>Phil described the pair, new to mountain walking, as “reasonably well
prepared“, adding: “If you had a list of stuff you should take, they had
it.“</p>
<p>He says their inexperience meant they lacked the right judgement,
whatever the information the AI had given them.</p>
<p>“I think they had a report of 60mph winds on top. To them it didn’t
mean anything.</p>
<p>“In mountain rescue what we’re finding is, there’s all the
information there, but it’s always interpreting it to the real-life
situation if you haven’t got the experience.“</p>
<p>The pair had reached the summit and taken shelter in a hut, but had
realised the situation was now beyond their capabilities.</p>
<p>This time, AI came to their rescue.</p>
<p>Gareth, who met the pair after they had been walked partway down the
mountain by colleagues, said: “Someone said this is how they’d found out
what to do. They’d spoken into an AI provider and said ‘we are stuck on
a mountain in the UK, what do we do’?“</p>
<p><strong>Gareth thinks the men were “no fools“ and had the kit and the
fitness for the trip but made “a little bit of an error in
judgement“.</strong></p>
<p>But it reinforces for him that <strong>there is no replacement for
human experience.</strong></p>
<p>Like Sam, he recommends seeking out local knowledge, either in person
or via online forums.</p>
<p>“I’m a recreational walker. I’ve done some of the more tricky walks,
but if an experienced walker said ‘it was a lot for me’, I’d probably
want to go with a mate or someone who knew the mountain a bit
better.“</p>
<p>For Phil, whether it’s AI, apps or phone batteries, there is a common
theme: “<strong>Technology’s brilliant, but you’ve got to know its
limitations.</strong>“</p>

es Salaam water crisis: Festive mood in Tanzanian city dampened by
persistent shortages</h3>
<p>At first light in Tanzania’s main city Dar es Salaam, some of its six
million residents begin their day with a frantic search for water.</p>
<ul>

<p>Christmas is approaching, but the festive mood is dampened by the dry
pipes, as the city experiences serious water shortages.</p>

<li><p>festive,英 [ˈfestɪv] 美 [ˈfestɪv] adj.

</ul>
<p>In some homes, plastic containers are stacked outside the door, ready
to be carried at a moment’s notice whenever word spreads that a nearby
tap is flowing again.</p>
<p>City authorities ration water. Homes get it once a week, but the wait
can stretch for weeks for some families. The crisis, caused by a drought
and rising demand, has persisted for months.</p>
<p>Many people are forced to turn to private vendors, who source their
water from boreholes and tanks. They are a respite for thousands of
families, but their high costs are a heavy burden to low-income
households.</p>
<p>Cedric Ndosi, who lives in Madale, north-west of the city, plans to
host guests for lunch on Christmas Day, but he is worried.</p>
<p>“Christmas is here and there is no water in our taps. We are forced
to buy water from shops for cooking and from water trucks for bathing,
but it’s expensive.</p>
<p>“We were used to spending money on drinks, but now even water for
cooking has become an added cost,“ he adds.</p>
<p>Furaha Awadhi, a mother of two living in Tegeta on the outskirts of
the city, says the price of water has risen from (£3) for 1,000 litres
to 0.</p>
<p>Cedric Mushi, who lives in Ubungo, west of Dar es Salaam</p>
<p>“It comes only once a week, usually in the late hours of the night,“
he says.</p>
<p>As a result of the prolonged dry spell since the end of the rainy
season in May, the water levels in rivers and groundwater that the city
depends on has sharply reduced, officials say.</p>
<p>The authorities say this has forced a cut in supplies from water
treatment plants. They also blame leaking pipes in the distribution
network, leading to water being lost.</p>
<p>Dar es Salaam, on the Indian Ocean coast, is among Africa’s
fastest-growing cities. Over the past two decades, its population has
more than doubled as an increasing number of people move in, looking for
better economic opportunities.</p>
<p>New neighbourhoods have spread far beyond the city’s original
boundaries, and even in good times, the available water supply could
barely serve its inhabitants.</p>
<p>For the festive season, Joyce Fredrick is planning to escape the heat
and the inconveniences of having no water.</p>
<p>“Here in Dar es Salaam it’s extremely hot, no rain, no water. We are
going to Arusha (in the north), where at least the weather is more
friendly,“ she tells the BBC.</p>
<p>Unlike many other major Tanzanian cities, Dar es Salaam has been
particularly vulnerable to the failure of the October to December rainy
season.</p>
<p>Even Dodoma, which often receives little rainfall throughout the
year, is less affected thanks to its man-made dams.</p>
<p>In contrast, Dar es Salaam lacks a nearby freshwater source, is
heavily populated, and experiences some of the country’s highest
temperatures, currently averaging around 33°C.</p>
<p>Although it is next to the sea, there is no desalination plant to
make the ocean water usable for residents.</p>
<p>Much of the city’s drinking water (about 70%) comes from the Ruvu
River, whose flow is closely linked to seasonal rainfall inland.</p>
<p>Smaller volumes are drawn from other rivers and from sources such as
boreholes, but these provide only limited relief when rains fail.</p>
<p>When the Ruvu’s flow drops, as has happened this time, the effects
are felt almost immediately, especially in high-lying areas and newly
developed suburbs of the city.</p>
<p>The impact is widespread but uneven, depending on a household’s
economic status.</p>
<p>People have invariably adapted to the uncertainty: some stay awake
until morning not to miss the rush of water in their pipes, others line
their rooftops and courtyards with containers to store every precious
drop of water from the little rain that falls.</p>
<p>For small business owners, the crisis has become an acute strain.
Some food vendors, salon operators, and car wash businesses have cut
back hours or raised prices.</p>
<p>Women are often seen looking for water for their homes.</p>
<p>“When water is scarce, everything else stops. At times hygiene
suffers, stress increases, especially for us mothers, and the whole
household feels the impact,“ says Tegemeo Kombe, who lives in Kibamba,
west of the city.</p>
<p>The government has acknowledged the severity of the problem. Water
Minister Juma Aweso told the BBC that Dar es Salaam’s dependence on
rainfall-fed rivers had left it particularly exposed.</p>
<p>“Longer-term solutions are under way, we are in the process of
building a dam that will collect water from different fresh water
sources to solve the problem in future,“ he said.</p>
<p>Aweso added that investments in the drilling of more boreholes will
help meet future demand and protect the city against climate shocks.</p>
<p>The Dar es Salaam Water and Sanitation Authority (Dawasa) has
apologised to residents for the disruption in their lives, and has
appealed to them to conserve water.</p>
<p>Critics however have called for better communication, clearer
rationing schedules and faster implementation of long-promised
projects.</p>
<p>And while some are concerned that water shortages risk becoming more
frequent, Ms Fredrick is hopeful that the situation will improve.</p>
<p>“When water is missing, life changes too,“ she tells the BBC. “We
believe things will be better next year.“</p>

sues to remove Trump’s name from Kennedy Center</h3>
<h5 id="something-about-kennedy-center"><a
href="./hash/0009.html">Something about Kennedy Center</a></h5>
<p>Democratic US Representative Joyce Beatty has filed a lawsuit seeking
to remove President Donald Trump’s name from the John F. Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts.</p>
<p>Last week, the board of the Kennedy Center - which Trump filled with
allies - voted to rename the performing arts centre the Trump-Kennedy
Center.</p>
<p>Beatty is one of several Democratic lawmakers designated as members
of the board by US law. She claimed in her lawsuit that the renaming was
illegal because changing the name requires “an act of Congress“.</p>
<p>The suit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name
change but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition.</p>
<p>Beatty argues that Congress intended for the centre to be a “living
memorial“ to former President Kennedy.</p>
<p>“[I]n scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the
American republic – the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists
renamed this storied center after President Trump,“ the lawsuit
states.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to the BBC, the White House said Trump had
“stepped up“ and saved the Kennedy Center “by strengthening its
finances, modernizing the building, and ending divisive woke
programming“.</p>
<p>“As a result, the Board of the Kennedy Center voted unanimously to
rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center — a historic move that marks a new
era of success, prestige, and restored grandeur for one of America’s
most iconic cultural institutions,“ White House spokesperson Liz Huston
said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the president’s name was added to the exterior of the
building, and the centre’s website logo now reads “The Trump Kennedy
Center“.</p>
<p>The name change has been met with harsh criticism, particularly in
Washington DC where the centre has been an iconic landmark since it was
built and named for Kennedy.</p>
<p>Construction began on a performing arts centre in the 1950s and after
Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to name it after
him.</p>
<p>Shortly after taking office, Trump fired a slew of the centre’s board
members and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make him
chairman of the board. His close adviser Richard Grenell became board
president.</p>
<p>The centre’s board of trustees currently has 34 members appointed by
Trump and 23 others designated as members by US law, according to the
centre’s website.</p>
<p>Trump also secured about 57m (£190m) in congressional funding to pay
for major renovations and other costs at the venue, saying it was in
“bad shape“.</p>
<p>Several members of the Kennedy family took to social media to
criticise the name change.</p>
<p>Joe Kennedy III, a former House member and grandnephew of the late
president, said that “the Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a
fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law“.</p>
<p>“It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln
Memorial, no matter what anyone says,“ he added.</p>

<p>But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison,

</ul>
<p>Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger
- they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure
in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular
newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal
democracy.</p>
<p>That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed
in 2020 by China’s Communist Party rulers in Beijing.</p>
<p>Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he
refused to leave.</p>
<p>“I got everything I have because of this place,“ he told the BBC
hours before he was arrested in 2020. “This is my redemption,“ he said,
choking up.</p>
<p>He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him.
That’s what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist
Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. It
cost him his own freedom.</p>
<p>Lai harboured “a rabid hatred“ of the Chinese Communist Party and “an
obsession to change the Party’s values to those of the Western world“,
the High Court ruled on Monday as it delivered the verdict in his
trial.</p>
<p>It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the
very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.</p>
<p>“Never,“ Lai had said to that charge when he testified, arguing that
he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong’s values:
“rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom
of religion, freedom of assembly“.</p>
<p>Monday’s verdict was welcomed by Hong Kong’s chief executive John
Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to “wantonly create social
conflicts“ and “glorify violence“. The law, he added, never allows
anyone to harm the country “under the guise of human rights, democracy
and freedom“.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to
pray with him, to Wong’s surprise.</p>
<p>Lai’s Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an
arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six
hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to
friends. “Even though he was suffering,“ Wong said, “he didn’t complain
nor was he afraid. He was at peace.“</p>
<p>Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not
when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the
gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong
tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.</p>
<p>For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply
capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the
city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found
success - and then a voice.</p>
<p>Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly
after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the
aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price
war.</p>
<p>From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the “adult section“ to
investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a
“buffet“ targeting “a full range of readers“, said Francis Lee, a
journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Former editors and employees spoke of Lai’s encouragement - “If you
dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it“ - and his temper. One
said he often swore.</p>
<p>They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn’t
afraid to bet on experiments. “Even before the iPhone was launched, he
kept saying mobile phones would be the future,“ recalled one of the
paper’s editors, adding that he was full of ideas. “It was as if he
asked us to create a new website every day.“</p>
<p>It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. “He was not
afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making
enemies,“ said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival
brand.</p>
<p>That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: “Otherwise, there
would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn’t have ended up
like this either.“</p>
<p>An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old
Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at
him.</p>
<p>It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>It was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as
a boy.</p>
<p>After carrying a passenger’s luggage at a railway station in China,
Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. “I asked
him where he’s from. He said Hong Kong. I said, ‘Hong Kong must be
heaven’ because I had never tasted anything like that,“ Lai said of the
encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Life in Mao Zedong’s China was punctuated by waves of oppressive
campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist
“class enemies“. The Lais, once a family of business people, were
blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His
mother was sent to a labour camp.</p>
<p>Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be
dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to
kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon
became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: “My tears
flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was
burning with humiliation.“</p>
<p>Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message:
“You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned
peanuts!“</p>
<p>And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions
who fled the mainland - and Mao’s devastating rule - over the years.</p>
<p>The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about
80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described
the long working hours as a “very happy time, a time that I knew I had a
future“. It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn
English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court
in fluent English.</p>
<p>By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making
money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was
27.</p>
<p>Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he
was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom
by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of
free-market capitalism. “People’s spontaneous reaction“ and “the
exchange of information“ have created the best in the world, was his
takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong’s strength.</p>
<p>The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same
book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired. “I want
to turn the author’s thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a
garden, not cut flowers,“ he said in a 2009 interview.</p>
<p>After a decade in manufacturing, he was “bored“ and founded the
clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It
was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his
Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.</p>
<p>Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao
died. He was “excited“, China “was going to be changed, like a Western
country“, he said in the 2007 documentary.</p>
<p>Then in 1989, Beijing</p>
<p>Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and
anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across
Hong Kong.</p>
<p>A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student
protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that
mourned the massacre.</p>
<p>Lai said later that he “didn’t feel anything about China“ until then.
He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but “all of a
sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the
night“.</p>
<p>The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994
published an open letter to Li Peng, “the Butcher of Beijing“ who played
a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him “the son of a turtle
egg with zero intelligence“.</p>
<p>Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano’s flagship store
in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and
stepped down as chairman.</p>
<p>“If I just go on making money, it doesn’t mean anything to me. But if
I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is
choice, and choice is freedom,“ Lai said in the 2007 documentary.</p>
<p>He soon became a “very active participant“ in Hong Kong’s
pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee
Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: “I
entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that
restrains personal liberties.“ He also started to voice concerns about
the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997.</p>
<p>“After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud
to return to the embrace of the motherland,“ he wrote. “But should we
love the motherland even if it doesn’t have freedom?“</p>
<p>During the handover, however, China’s then-leader Jiang Zemin
promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have
a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.</p>
<p>The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing’s refusal to allow
completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for
Lai.</p>
<p>Protesters occupied the city’s main commercial districts for 79 days.
Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw
animal entrails at him. “When the police started firing tear gas, I was
with Fatty,“ the former lawmaker Lee recalled.</p>
<p>The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be
cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019,
Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that
would have allowed extradition to mainland China.</p>
<p>What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning
the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw
bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot
police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live
rounds.</p>
<p>Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for
participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC
he was surprised to see Lai: “To me, he’s a busy businessman, but he
showed up.“</p>
<p>Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a
sounding board for an anti-government movement.</p>
<p>Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was “instrumental“ in the
protests because Apple Daily carried a “totally false“ slogan –
anti-extradition to China – which “caught the imagination of people who
wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong“.</p>
<p>Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai
exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national
security trial.</p>
<p>Lai instructed the editorial team to “urge people to take to the
streets“, according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple
Daily’s parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution
witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was
raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.</p>
<p>During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met
then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A
month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a
controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily
readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to “save Hong
Kong“.</p>
<p>All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a
foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong’s internal affairs.</p>
<p>“Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo
any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from
Beijing,“ Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 “are totally against
common sense“.</p>

<p>Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from “chaos to governance“ and
onto “greater prosperity“ because of the national security law and a
“patriot-only“ parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands
of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and
the city’s freedoms severely curbed.</p>

<p>“What we’re asking for is to stop these real-term pay cuts that the
government is recommending for doctors,“ he said.</p>
<p>Asked about recent polling that suggests public support for the
strikes is declining, he said: “I do care what my patients think but I
didn’t sign up to give that care in a corridor.“</p>
<p>This is the 14th walkout by resident doctors in a long-running pay
dispute.</p>
<p>The strike went ahead after last-minute talks between the government
and union broke down without agreement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The meeting was described as “constructive“ by the government, but
not enough progress had been made to call off the strike.</p>
<p>Resident doctors represent nearly half of the doctors working in the
NHS. They are walking out of both emergency and non-urgent care with
senior doctors drafted in to provide cover.</p>
<p>Around 50 medics have been protesting outside St Thomas’ Hospital in
London, and more at hospitals around the country including Leeds and
Newcastle.</p>
<p>Dr Krunthika Ramamurthi, who was trained as a doctor in India and has
been working in the UK for five years, said she has not been able to
obtain a specialty training post, which doctors can apply for after the
first two years of training.</p>
<p>Instead, she has been forced to work as a locum and work short-term
posts that do not count towards her training.</p>
<p>“It is really difficult. I am not progressing in my career – it is
clear there is a shortage of jobs. I don’t want to strike, but the
government is not addressing our concerns – pay is still below the 2008
levels,“ she said.</p>
<p>“If the NHS is crumbling because of the flu cases that tells you
everything really – the NHS needs to be better resourced.“</p>
<p>In the two most recent strikes – in July and November – NHS England
said it was able to keep the majority of non-urgent operations and
treatments, such as hip and knee replacements, going.</p>
<p>Speaking in parliament on Wednesday morning, Health Secretary Wes
Streeting said he “deeply regretted“ the impact the strike would have on
patients in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
<p>He said the situation in some hospitals was already “dicey“ and he
was concerned about the effect on other medical staff who would be
“knackered as a result“ of industrial action.</p>
<p>He said there was no sign of a breakthrough after five hours of talks
with BMA representatives on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I think on jobs, [we are] broadly in agreement, [but] on pay [we
are] too far apart,“ he said.</p>
<p>“These strikes will come at a cost of £250m and impact on operational
pressures, on patients and on the whole NHS workforce, and I deeply
regret we are in this situation.“</p>
<p>Concern has been expressed that hospitals may struggle to discharge
patients in time for Christmas as the doctors who are working
concentrate on providing strike cover.</p>
<p>Medical director Prof Meghana Pandit said the strikes came “at an
immensely challenging time for the NHS“, with record numbers of patients
in hospital with flu for this time of year.</p>
<p>She said more patients were likely to feel the impact of this round
of strikes than the previous two, adding that staff who are covering for
those striking would not get a Christmas break with their families.</p>
<p>NHS England said GP practices will continue to be open and urgent and
emergency care services will be available for those who need them.</p>
<p>But even then there is likely to be some disruption.</p>
<p>NHS England said the public should use</p>
<p>Patients who need emergency medical care should continue to use 999
or come forward to AandandandandE as normal, it added.</p>
<p>The strike is going ahead despite a new offer from the government
being made last week, which included increasing the number of speciality
training posts and covering out-of-pocket expenses like exam fees.</p>
<p>Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents
hospital and ambulance services, said the strikes are “like having the
worst possible Groundhog Day“.</p>
<p>“But unlike the film this is real, so thousands of patients are going
to have their operations and procedures postponed or cancelled,“ he told
BBC Breakfast.</p>
<p>He added that the “increasingly acrimonious dispute“ feels like it’s
as “far away from being resolved as it ever has been“.</p>
<p>However, he added that patients will still be safe in hospital and
that people should attend appointments unless informed otherwise.</p>
<p>On Monday the BMA announced its members had voted to continue with
the strike – effectively rejecting the offer in the process – after the
union agreed to hold an online poll of members.</p>
<p>Streeting has maintained he will not discuss pay as doctors have
received pay rises totalling nearly 30% over the past three years.</p>
<p>The BMA argues that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors’ pay is
still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into
account.</p>
<p>But it said it was committed to ensuring patient safety.</p>
<p>“We will be in close contact with NHS England throughout the strikes
to address safety concerns if they arise,“ the union added.</p>
<p>Resident doctors in Wales have accepted a new contract which promises
a 4% additional investment in their workforce.</p>
<p>In Scotland, BMA resident doctor members are waiting for the results
of their strike ballot later this week, after claiming government
ministers went back on an agreement over pay.</p>

<p>However, in recent months, Spain’s all-in commitment to renewables

<p>With the government unable to offer a full explanation for the

mainland Spain registered a record 61.5% of the electricity mix has
fuelled such claims.</p>
<p>Yet the government and national grid operator Red Eléctrica have both
denied that the outage was linked to the preponderance of renewable
energy sources in Spain.</p>
<ul>
<li>preponderance,英 [prɪˈpɒndərəns] 美 [prɪˈpɑːndərəns]
n. 优势；多数；占优势</li>
</ul>
<p>“We have operated the system with higher renewable rates [previously]
with no effect on the security of the system,“ says Concha Sánchez, head
of operations for Red Eléctrica. “Definitely it’s not a question of the
rate of renewables at that moment.“</p>
<p>Ms Sánchez said the blackout was caused by a combination of issues,
including an “unknown event“ in the system moments before, which saw
anomalous voltage oscillations.</p>
<p>However, Red Eléctrica and the government are still awaiting reports
on the incident that they hope will determine the exact cause. A
cyber-attack has repeatedly been ruled out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, since April, Spain’s electricity mix has been modified
somewhat, with greater reliance on natural gas, reinforcing the notion
that the country is at an energy crossroads.</p>
<p>Spain’s nuclear industry, which currently contributes around 20% of
national electricity, has been particularly vocal since the blackout,
pushing back against government plans to close the country’s five
nuclear plants between 2027 and 2035.</p>
<p>With many European countries undergoing a nuclear renaissance, the
planned closures make Spain something of an outlier. The companies that
own the Almaraz plant in south-western Spain, due to be the first to
shut down, have requested a three-year extension to its life until 2030.
That request is currently under consideration.</p>
<p>Ignacio Araluce, president of Foro Nuclear, an association that
represents the industry, says Spain is the only country in the world
that is scheduling the closure of nuclear plants that are in operation.
He believes nuclear energy provides stability while being compatible
with the green energy transition.</p>
<p>“It’s prudent to have a mix of renewables and nuclear energy,“ he
says.</p>
<p>Mr Araluce praises renewable sources because they only require
natural elements to generate electricity, but points out that they are
not able to operate around the clock or when weather is
unfavourable.</p>
<p>“How can you produce energy in those hours when the renewables are
not producing?“ he asks. The answer, he added, is “with a source like
nuclear, that is not producing CO2, that is producing all hours of the
year“.</p>
<p>The political opposition is staunchly opposed to the nuclear
shut-down. The far-right Vox, criticising what it saw as a lack of
explanation by the government for the April blackout, recently described
nuclear power as “a crucial source of stability“.</p>
<p>Ms Sánchez acknowledges that there is room for improvement for
Spain’s electricity model, pointing to the Iberian peninsula’s relative
isolation from the European grid compared to most of its EU neighbours.
She also sees storage as an issue.</p>
<p>“While we have taken a good path when it comes to renewable
installation, we cannot say the same regarding storage,“ she says. “We
need to foster storage installation.“</p>
<p>Spain’s political panorama adds an element of uncertainty to its
energy future. The Socialist-led coalition has been mired in corruption
scandals and its parliamentary majority appears to have collapsed in
recent weeks, raising the possibility of a snap election in the coming
months.</p>
<p>A right-wing government, which polls suggest would be the likely
outcome, would almost certainly place less emphasis on renewables and
advocate a partial return to more traditional energy sources.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, Spain’s renewable transition continues.</p>
<p>And for Figueruelas, in Aragón, that means not just cheap, clean
energy, but investment. The town’s population, of just 1,000, is due to
increase dramatically, with 2,000 Chinese workers scheduled to arrive to
help build the new battery plant, which is expected to create up to
35,000 indirect jobs once it starts operating.</p>
<p>“These kinds of investments revitalise the area, they revitalise the
construction sector, hostelry,“ says local man Manuel Martín. “And the
energy is free – it just depends on the sun and the wind.“</p>

<p>The US has repeatedly delayed the date by which the platform’s
Chinese owner, ByteDance, must sell or be blocked for American

<p>US President Donald Trump initially gave himself until December 16 to
comply with the law before moving the deadline to 23 January 2026 with a
new executive order.</p>

Frank McCourt told BBC News.</p>
<p>“But if the moment arrives, we’re prepared to move forward… we’ve
raised the capital to buy it - we’ll see.“</p>

<p>Members of the Trump administration had indicated the deal would be
formalised in a meeting between Trump and Xi in October - however it
concluded without an agreement being reached.</p>
<p>Neither TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance nor Beijing have since
announced approval of a sale, despite Trump’s claims.</p>
<p>When Trump signed his most recent executive order extending the
deadline to January, he said in an online post it would lead to a deal
being completed.</p>
<p>Without naming Trump’s hand-selected investors, Mr McCourt told the
BBC he was concerned “about a concentration of power and influence
because platforms like TikTok are very influencing“.</p>
<p>He is part of a group of investors including Reddit co-founder Alexis
Ohanian and Canadian investor Kevin O’Leary.</p>
<p>“My hope would be that whatever happens, that it is shut down or
sold, and lands in the hands of people that comply with the law,“ he
said.</p>
<p>He said he wants to operate TikTok without any of its Chinese
technology, including its powerful recommendation algorithm,</p>

</ul>
<p>“I’m a born rebel,“ he told the BBC in an interview in 2020, hours
before he was charged. “I have a very rebellious character.“</p>
<p>Lai was born in Guangzhou, a city in southern China, to a wealthy
family that lost everything when the communists took power in 1949.</p>
<p>He was 12 years old when he fled his village in mainland China,
arriving in Hong Kong as a stowaway on a fishing boat.</p>
<p>While working odd jobs and knitting in a small clothing shop he
taught himself English. He went from a menial role to eventually
founding a multi-million dollar empire including the international
clothing brand Giordano.</p>
<p>The chain was a huge success. But when China sent in tanks to crush
pro-democracy protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989, Lai began
a new journey as a vocal democracy activist as well as an
entrepreneur.</p>
<p>He started writing columns criticising the massacre that followed the
demonstrations in Beijing and established a publishing house that went
on to become one of Hong Kong’s most influential.</p>
<p>As China responded by threatening to shut his stores on the mainland,
leading him to sell the company, Lai launched a string of popular
pro-democracy titles that included Next, a digital magazine, and the
widely read Apple Daily newspaper.</p>
<p>In a local media landscape increasingly fearful of Beijing, Lai had
been a persistent critic of Chinese authorities both through his
publications and writing.</p>
<p>This has seen him become a hero for many in Hong Kong, who view him
as a man of courage who took great risks to defend the freedoms of the
city.</p>
<p>But on the mainland he is viewed as a “traitor“ who threatens Chinese
national security.</p>
<p>In recent years, masked attackers firebombed Lai’s house and company
headquarters. He was also the target of an assassination plot.</p>
<p>But none of the threats stopped him from airing his views robustly.
He was a prominent part of the city’s pro-democracy demonstrations and
was arrested twice in 2021 on illegal assembly charges.</p>
<p>When China passed Hong Kong’s new national security law in June 2020,
Lai told the BBC it sounded the “death knell“ for the territory.</p>
<p>The media mogul is known for his frankness and acts of
flamboyance.</p>
<p>In 2021, he urged Donald Trump to help the territory, saying he was
“the only one who can save us“ from China. His newspaper, Apple Daily,
published a front-page letter that finished: “Mr President, please help
us.“</p>
<p>For Lai, such acts were necessary to defend the city which had taken
him in and fuelled his success.</p>
<p>He once told news agency AFP: “I came here with nothing, the freedom
of this place has given me everything… Maybe it’s time I paid back for
that freedom by fighting for it.“</p>
<p>Lai has been charged with various offences - including unauthorised
assembly and fraud - since 2020.</p>
<p>The prosecution of Lai has captured international attention, with
rights groups and foreign governments urging his release.</p>
<p>Over the years, Sebastien Lai has travelled the world to denounce his
father’s arrest and condemn Hong Kong for punishing “characteristics
that should be celebrated“.</p>
<p>“My father is in jail for the truth on his lips, courage in his
heart, and freedom in his soul,“ he had said.</p>

<p>Some men are having vast numbers of children through sperm donation.
This week the</p>
<p>One of the most striking aspects of the investigation was that the
man’s sperm was sent to 14 countries and produced at least 197 children.
The revelation was a rare insight into the scale of the sperm donor
industry.</p>

<p>So why are some sperm donors fathering so many children, what made
Danish or so-called “Viking sperm“ so popular, and does the industry
need to be reined in?</p>

<p>If you’re a man reading this, we are sorry to break it to you, but
the quality of your sperm probably isn’t good enough to become a donor -
fewer than five in 100 volunteers actually make the grade.</p>
<p>First, you have to produce enough sperm in a sample - that’s your</p>
<p>Sperm is also checked to ensure it can survive being frozen and
stored at a sperm bank.</p>
<p>You could be perfectly fertile, have six children, and still not be
suitable.</p>

<p>Overall, it means the pool of people that finally become sperm donors
is small. In the UK, half the sperm ends up being imported.</p>
<p>But biology means a small number of donors can make vast numbers of
children. It takes just one sperm to fertilise an egg, but there are
tens of millions of sperm in each ejaculation.</p>

<p>Sarah Norcross, the director of the Progress Educational Trust
charity which works on fertility and genomics, said the donor sperm
shortage made it “a precious commodity“ and “sperm banks and fertility
clinics are maximising the use of available donors to meet demand“.</p>
<p><strong>From this small pool of donors, some men’s sperm is just more
popular than others.</strong></p>
<p>Donors are not chosen at random. It’s a similar process to the savage
reality of dating apps, when some men get way more matches than
others.</p>

<p>Ole Schou, the 71-year-old founder of the Cryos International sperm

</ul>
<p>And that, Schou says, has allowed the country to become “one of the
few exporters of sperm“.</p>
<p>But he argues Danish sperm is also popular due to genetics. He told
the BBC <strong>the Danish “blue-eyed and blonde-haired genes“ are
recessive traits, which means they need to come from both parents in
order to appear in a child.</strong></p>

<p>As a result, the mother’s traits, such as dark hair, “might be
dominant in the resulting child“, Schou explains.</p>
<p>He says <strong>demand for donor sperm is coming mainly from “single,
highly-educated, women in their 30s“.</strong> They now make up 60% of
requests.</p>
<p>One aspect of</p>
<p>Nations have their own rules on how many times one man’s sperm can be
used. Sometimes it is linked to a total number of children, others limit
it to a certain number of mothers (so each family can have as many
related children as they want).</p>
<p>The original argument around those limits was to avoid half-siblings
- who didn’t know they were related - meeting each other, forming

<p>But there’s nothing to stop the same donor’s sperm being used in
Italy and Spain and then the Netherlands and Belgium, as long as the
rules are being followed in each country.</p>
<p><strong>This creates circumstances where a sperm donor can legally
father large numbers of children. Although the man is often in the dark

<p>“Many recipients, and also donors, are unaware that a single donor’s
sperm can be lawfully used in many different countries - this fact
should be better explained,“ says Sarah Norcross, who argues it would be
“sensible“ to bring down the number of children one donor can have.</p>

<p>In response to the investigation into the sperm donor who passed on a
gene that led to cancer in some of the 197 children he fathered,
officials in Belgium have called on the European Commission to establish
a Europe-wide sperm donor register to monitor sperm travelling across
borders.</p>

<p>Deputy prime minister Frank Vandenbroucke said the industry was like
the “Wild West“ and “the initial mission of offering people the
possibility of a family has given way to a veritable fertility
business“.</p>
<p>The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology has also
proposed a limit of 50 families per donor across the EU. That system
would still allow one donor’s sperm to make more than 100 children if
the families wanted two or more babies each.</p>
<p>Concerns have been raised about the impact on the children conceived
through sperm donation. Some will be happy, others can be profoundly
distressed by the double discovery of being made with donor sperm and
being one of hundreds of half-siblings.</p>
<p>The same is true of donors, who often have no idea their sperm is
being so widely distributed.</p>
<p>These risks are amplified by readily available DNA ancestry tests and
social media where people can search for their children, siblings or the
donor. In the UK, there is no longer anonymity for sperm donors and
there is an official process through which children learn the identity
of their biological father.</p>
<p>Mr Schou at Cryos argues more restrictions on sperm donation would
just lead families to “turn to the private, totally unregulated,
market“.</p>
<p>Dr John Appleby, a medical ethicist at Lancaster University, said the
implications of using sperm so widely was a “vast“ ethical
minefield.</p>
<p>He said there are issues around identity, privacy, consent, dignity
and more - making it a “balancing act“ between competing needs.</p>
<p>Dr Appleby said the fertility industry had a “responsibility to get a
handle on the number of times a donor is used“, but agreeing global
regulations would be undeniably “very difficult“.</p>
<p>He added that a global sperm donor register, which has been
suggested, came with its own “ethical and legal challenges“.</p>

<p>It means that thoughts in Japan are turning to the “big one“ - a
once-in-a-century quake.</p>
<p>In September, Japan’s earthquake investigation panel said there was a

area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan’s Pacific coast -
within the next 30 years.</p>

<p>In April authorities had warned that a megaquake had the potential to
trigger a tsunami of more than 20m (66ft) which could hit parts of Tokyo
and other prefectures. They predicted that there would be around 300,000
deaths and trillions of dollars in economic damage.</p>

</ul>
<p>So, what is the “big one“, can it be predicted - and is it likely to
strike any time soon?</p>
<p>Officials urged residents in seven prefectures from Hokkaido in the
north to Chiba in central Japan to stay on high alert for a potential
megaquake.</p>
<p>This is a vast area with millions of people.</p>
<p>A government official said there was a possibility that “a
large-scale earthquake with a magnitude of 8 or higher could occur as a
follow-up earthquake“ in the region.</p>
<p>Authorities also told people to check evacuation routes, secure
furniture, and prepare emergency kits, including food, water and
portable toilets.</p>
<p>However, an evacuation order was not issued.</p>
<p>Japan’s director for disaster management said at a news conference
that global earthquake data suggests there’s a possibility, not a
prediction, of a larger tremor to come.</p>
<p>Officials said the possibility of a larger quake occurring is about
one in 100.</p>
<p>Japan is a country used to earthquakes. It sits on the Ring of Fire
and, as a result, experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year.</p>
<p>The vast majority do little damage, but there are some - like the one
which struck in 2011 measuring magnitude 9.0, sending a tsunami into the
north-east coast and killing more than 18,000 people.</p>
<p>But the one that authorities fear may strike in this more densely
populated region to the south could - in the absolute worst-case
scenario - be even more deadly.</p>
<p>Earthquakes along the Nankai Trough have already been responsible for
thousands of deaths.</p>
<p>In 1707, a rupture along its entire 600km length caused the
second-biggest earthquake ever recorded in Japan and was followed by the
eruption of Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>These so-called “megathrust“ earthquakes tend to strike every hundred
years or so, often in pairs: the last ones were in 1944 and 1946.</p>
<p>And this long-anticipated event is, according to geologists Kyle
Bradley and Judith A Hubbard, “the original definition of the ‘Big
One’”.</p>
<p>“The history of great earthquakes at Nankai is convincingly scary“ so
as to be concerning, the pair acknowledged</p>
<p>Not according to Robert Geller, professor emeritus of seismology at
the University of Tokyo.</p>
<p>When authorities issued a megaquake warning last year, after a 7.1
quake struck southern Japan, Prof Geller told the BBC that the warning
had “almost nothing to do with science“.</p>
<p>The advisory was “not a useful piece of information“, he said.</p>
<p>This, he argued, is because while earthquakes are known to be a
“clustered phenomenon“, it is “not possible to tell in advance whether a
quake is a foreshock or an aftershock”.</p>
<p>Indeed, only about 5% of earthquakes are “foreshocks“, said Bradley
and Hubbard.</p>
<p>However, the 2011 earthquake was preceded by a 7.2 magnitude
foreshock, they note - one which was largely ignored.</p>
<p>The warning system was drawn up after 2011 in an attempt to prevent a
disaster of this scale again. August 2024 was the first time the Japan
Meteorological Agency (JMA) used it.</p>
<p>But, crucially, while it told people to be prepared, it did not tell
anyone to evacuate. Indeed, they were keen to play down any massive
imminent risk.</p>
<p>“The likelihood of a new major earthquake is higher than normal, but
this is not an indication that a major earthquake will definitely
occur,“ the JMA said at the time.</p>

<p>At an event in Washington DC on Sunday, he said Netflix has a “big
market share“ and the firms’ combined size “could be a problem“.</p>
<p>On Friday, the two companies said they had</p>
<p>The planned deal, which has raised concerns among some in the
industry, is yet to be approved by competition authorities. The BBC has
contacted Warner Bros, Netflix and the White House for comment.</p>
<p>Launched in 1997 as a postal DVD rental business, Netflix has grown
to become the world’s largest subscription streaming service. The deal,
the biggest the film industry has seen in a long time, would cement its
number one position.</p>

</ul>
<p>Under the agreement several global entertainment franchises, such as
Looney Tunes, The Matrix and Lord of the Rings, would move to
Netflix.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to be completed after Warner Bros splits its
business in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>The US Justice Department’s competition division, which oversees
major mergers, could contend that the deal violates the law if the
combined businesses account for too much of the streaming market.</p>
<p>At an event at the</p>
<p>Trump added he would be personally involved in the decision on
whether or not to approve the deal and repeatedly highlighted the size
of Netflix’s market share.</p>
<p>He also said that Netflix’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos recently visited the
Oval Office and praised him for his work at the company.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of respect for him. He’s a great person,“ said Trump.
“He’s done one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.“</p>
<p>Mr Sarandos earlier acknowledged that the agreement may have
surprised investors but said it was a chance to position Netflix for
success in the “decades to come“.</p>
<p>Blair Westlake, a media executive and former chair of Universal
Studios’ television and networks group, told the BBC’s Today programme
that “the only two pieces that matter“ when it came to competition
concerns were the combination of Netflix and Warner Brothers’ HBO
streaming business.</p>
<p>“Netflix is not in the studio production business the way Warner
Brothers is, and even the library size of films and television
programming that Netflix owns pales in comparison to Warner,“ he
said.</p>
<p>However, while the Netflix deal would give it a strong position in
video streaming, experts have said it would not look so dominant if
regulators adopt a broader definition, to include cable and broadcast TV
and also YouTube as competitors.</p>
<p>“A lot of people don’t realise that the number one place that
consumers in the world go for viewing of content consumption is YouTube,
and it’s far and away beyond anything else,“ said Mr Westlake.</p>
<p>He added he thought the deal would eventually be approved, but “I
think that there will probably be concessions that have to be made“.</p>
<p>Bill Kovacic, a former chair of the US competition watchdog the
Federal Trade Commission, told the Today programme that Trump’s comments
meant negotiations over any problems surrounding the deal were “going to
run through the White House“.</p>
<p>“That means that we’re going to have probably a deep level, an
unprecedented level of presidential control in the resolution of what
used to be a technical analysis of a merger,“ he said.</p>
<p>Netflix beat several rivals including Comcast and Paramount Skydance
to strike an agreement with Warner Bros.</p>
<p>Paramount Skydance, which is headed by David Ellison, had previously
tried to buy all of Warner Bros, including its cable networks.</p>
<p>Warner Bros rejected that approach before putting itself up for
sale.</p>
<p>David Ellison’s multi-billionaire father, Larry Ellison, is a close
ally of Trump.</p>
<p>The Writers Guild of America’s East and West branches called for the
merger to be blocked, saying the “world’s largest streaming company
swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were
designed to prevent.“</p>
<p>“The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions
for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers and reduce the
volume and diversity of content for all viewers,“ it</p>

Husain: New Doha museum Lawh Wa Qalam celebrates Indian art legend</h3>
<p>At the edge of Doha, a new grey-blue building rises like a drawing on
its skyline, its shimmering tiles shifting with the sun and casting
geometric shadows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>shimmer,英 [ˈʃɪmə(r)] 美 [ˈʃɪmər] v. （使）闪烁；发闪烁的微光

</ul>
<p>The building seems to be leaning forward, as if eager to tell a
story.</p>
<p>In a video clip of Lawh Wa Qalam, the world’s first museum dedicated
to MF Husain, we see glimpses of the extraordinary work of the late
legendary Indian artist, whose prolific paintings and turbulent personal
history have fascinated the world.</p>
<p>The museum honours the legacy of the artist who spent his last years
in Qatar and was granted citizenship in 2010.</p>
<p>Spanning over some 3,000 sq m, it opened to visitors last week and is
part of the expansive campus of Qatar Foundation’s Education City, an
educational and research hub.</p>
<p>Inside, more than 150 works and objects - including paintings,
sculptures, films, tapestries and photos - map the astonishing breadth
of Husain’s career, offering visitors a rare window into the artist’s
late-life reflections and inspirations.</p>
<p>Husain always wanted his museum to feel like home, says Noof
Mohammed, the curator. “We want visitors to experience the world as he
did, in an intimate, playful and reflective manner.“</p>
<p>Few artists have travelled as widely, or imaginatively, as Husain.
His horses - muscular and dynamic - remain some of the most prized and
instantly recognisable paintings in contemporary art, sold for millions
of dollars.</p>
<p>An artist who was often described to have a nomadic and bohemian
disposition, he dabbled seamlessly with Cubist-inspired modernism and
traditional Indian themes, creating bold and vibrant canvases with
scenes from history and mythology.</p>
<p>His signature style earned him the moniker of “the Picasso of India“.
He also made two Bollywood films, which failed at the box office.</p>
<p>Husain was also never without controversy. His paintings of nude
Hindu goddesses angered hardline Hindus who accused him of obscenity,
forcing him into a self-imposed exile.</p>
<p>After a tumultous few years, it was in Qatar, away from the cultural
battles at home, that he entered a period of deep contemplation and
artistic renewal.</p>
<p>“He was deeply engaged here, charmed and inspired by the Arab
civilisation and culture,“ Yousef Ahmad, a Qatar-based artist who knew
Husain during his final years, told the BBC.</p>
<p>“People often forget that some of his most ambitious works in later
life were conceived in Qatar.“</p>
<p>It is fitting then that the Lawh Wa Qalam museum refuses to be a
conventional tribute to the artist.</p>
<p>One of the museum’s main attractions is Seeroo fi al ardh (Walk In
The Land), the ambitious multimedia project that occupied Husain’s final
years, which he envisaged as a narrative of civilisation told through
movement, sound and mechanical choreography.</p>
<p>In fact, the museum building itself is inspired by a 2008 sketch
Husain made, showing two sculptural masses - the vivid blue-grey house
connected by a cylindirical tower.</p>
<p>Indian architect Martand Khosla, who designed the structure with the
Qatar Foundation, recalls the challenge of working from a single
drawing, imagining countless conversations with the artist.</p>
<p>“A sketch does not have scale. It is an intent. And converting that
intent into an actual functional museum was a different ballgame,“ he
tells the BBC.</p>
<p>Rather than treating Husain’s sketch as a blueprint, Mr Khosla used
it as a philosophical starting point: “What should remain literal and
what is metaphorical?“</p>
<p>“It was like developing a new architectural language,“ he says.</p>
<p>The result is a labyrinthine layout that invites visitors to wander,
exploring every line, shade, and shadow as if following Husain’s own
brushstrokes.</p>
<p>“We hope the museum sparks discovery the same way Husain’s murals do
- each visit can reveal a completely different experience or discovery “
Mr Khosla says.</p>
<p>Each gallery opens with a Husain quote, inviting visitors into his
thoughts. Long corridors lead to immersive displays of paintings,
sculptures, and everyday objects - including his old Indian passport -
tell the story of an artist, filmmaker, and philosopher who traveled the
world yet never stopped yearning for India.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Husain’s beloved horses take centre stage in the
museum.</p>
<p>“We have tried to gather oral histories by talking to people who knew
Husain, such as his driver, collaborators and friends, to give a
personal sense of who he was,“ Ms Mohammed explains.</p>
<p>Mr Ahmad, the artist, says the museum’s interactive format offers a
chance to understand the artist beyond the public controversies and lore
that defined his life.</p>
<p>Many recall Husain as the barefoot, eccentric artist with flowing
white hair and a penchant for controversies.</p>
<p>“But at his core, he was a genius who was endlessly fascinated by
storytelling, whether it was through mythology, modernity or memory,“ Mr
Ahmad adds.</p>
<p>A lesser-known chapter of Husain’s journey unfolded in the Gulf,
which the museum highlights. In his later years, he developed a deep
interest in Islamic texts and Arab history.</p>
<p>In 2008, Husain accepted a major commission from Qatar’s Sheikh Moza
bint Nasser, chairperson of Qatar Foundation. From a studio in Doha, he
created a vast series celebrating Arab civilisation, exploring Islamic
history, faith, and human movement.</p>
<p>Using a rich, bold palette, he depicted Islamic astronomers,
philosophers, and desert wanderers with the same kinetic lines that
defined his Indian art, but in warmer, earthen ochres reflecting the
Gulf’s landscape.</p>
<p>“One of these paintings, The Battle of Badr, a pivotal moment in
Islamic history, demonstrates his mastery of both movement and colour as
he continued to merge historical and spiritual narratives in his
signature style,“ Ms Mohammed says.</p>
<p>Husain was commissioned to create 99 works but could complete only 35
in his lifetime, which are now a part of the museum’s collection.</p>
<p>“The plan is to rotate these over time, allowing visitors to
experience the full breadth of his work gradually,“ Ms Mohammed
says.</p>
<p>By showing these alongside his Indian works, the museum not only
celebrates Husain’s legacy but also reframes it in a new context.</p>
<p>Though rooted in India, Husain’s worldview and work were shaped by a
broader constellation of regions and histories, Mr Khosla says.</p>
<p>“He had multiple identities simultaneously. And that layering is what
makes this project incredibly rich.“</p>

迷失，迷路；步入歧途，堕落</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure that America remains the world’s strongest, richest, most
powerful, and most successful country for decades to come, our country
needs a coherent, focused strategy for how we interact with the world.
And to get that right, all Americans need to know what, exactly, it is
we are trying to do and why.</p>

相互交流，互动；相互作用，相互影响</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A “strategy” is a concrete, realistic plan that explains the
essential connection between ends and means: it begins from an accurate
assessment of what is desired and what tools are available, or can
realistically be created, to achieve the desired outcomes.</p>

<p>A strategy must evaluate, sort, and prioritize. Not every country,

strategy. The purpose of foreign policy is the protection of core
national interests; that is the sole focus of this strategy.</p>

<p>Our elites badly miscalculated America’s willingness to shoulder
forever global burdens to which the American people saw no connection to
the national interest. They overestimated America’s ability to fund,
simultaneously, a massive welfare-regulatory-administrative state
alongside a massive military, diplomatic, intelligence, and foreign aid
complex. They placed hugely misguided and destructive bets on globalism
and so-called “free trade” that hollowed out the very middle class and
industrial base on which American economic and military preeminence
depend. They allowed allies and partners to offload the cost of their
defense onto the American people, and sometimes to suck us into
conflicts and controversies central to their interests but peripheral or
irrelevant to our own. And they lashed American policy to a network of
international institutions, some of which are driven by outright
anti-Americanism and many by a transnationalism that explicitly seeks to
dissolve individual state sovereignty. In sum, not only did our elites
pursue a fundamentally undesirable and impossible goal, in doing so they
undermined the very means necessary to achieve that goal: the character
of our nation upon which its power, wealth, and decency were built.</p>

<li>President Trump’s Necessary, Welcome Correction</li>
</ol>
<p>None of this was inevitable. President Trump’s first administration
proved that with the right leadership making the right choices, all of
the above could—and should—have been avoided, and much else achieved. He
and his team successfully marshaled America’s great strengths to correct
course and begin ushering in a new golden age for our country. To
continue the United States on that path is the overarching purpose of
President Trump’s second administration, and of this document.</p>
<p>The questions before us now are: 1) What should the United States
want? 2) What are our available means to get it? and 3) How can we
connect ends and means into a viable National Security Strategy?</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>What Should the United States Want?</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>What Do We Want Overall?</li>
</ol>
<p>First and foremost, we want the continued survival and safety of the
United States as an independent, sovereign republic whose government
secures the God-given natural rights of its citizens and prioritizes
their well-being and interests.</p>
<p>We want to protect this country, its people, its territory, its
economy, and its way of life from military attack and hostile foreign
influence, whether espionage, predatory trade practices, drug and human
trafficking, destructive propaganda and influence operations, cultural
subversion, or any other threat to our nation.</p>
<p>We want full control over our borders, over our immigration system,
and over transportation networks through which people come into our
country—legally and illegally. We want a world in which migration is not
merely “orderly” but one in which sovereign countries work together to
stop rather than facilitate destabilizing population flows, and have
full control over whom they do and do not admit.</p>
<p>We want a resilient national infrastructure that can withstand
natural disasters, resist and thwart foreign threats, and prevent or
mitigate any events that might harm the American people or disrupt the
American economy. No adversary or danger should be able to hold America
at risk.</p>
<p>We want to recruit, train, equip, and field the world’s most
powerful, lethal, and technologically advanced military to protect our
interests, deter wars, and—if necessary—win them quickly and decisively,
with the lowest possible casualties to our forces. And we want a
military in which every single servicemember is proud of their country
and confident in their mission.</p>
<p>We want the world’s most robust, credible, and modern nuclear
deterrent, plus next-generation missile defenses—including a Golden Dome
for the American homeland—to protect the American people, American
assets overseas, and American allies.</p>
<p>We want the world’s strongest, most dynamic, most innovative, and
most advanced economy. The U.S. economy is the bedrock of the American
way of life, which promises and delivers widespread and broad-based
prosperity, creates upward mobility, and rewards hard work. Our economy
is also the bedrock of our global position and the necessary foundation
of our military.</p>
<p>We want the world’s most robust industrial base. American national
power depends on a strong industrial sector capable of meeting both
peacetime and wartime production demands. That requires not only direct
defense industrial production capacity but also defense-related
production capacity. Cultivating American industrial strength must
become the highest priority of national economic policy.</p>
<p>We want the world’s most robust, productive, and innovative energy
sector—one capable not just of fueling American economic growth but of
being one of America’s leading export industries in its own right.</p>
<p>We want to remain the world’s most scientifically and technologically
advanced and innovative country, and to build on these strengths. And we
want to protect our intellectual property from foreign theft. America’s
pioneering spirit is a key pillar of our continued economic dominance
and military superiority; it must be preserved.</p>
<p>We want to maintain the United States’ unrivaled “soft power” through
which we exercise positive influence throughout the world that furthers
our interests. In doing so, we will be unapologetic about our country’s
past and present while respectful of other countries’ differing
religions, cultures, and governing systems. “Soft power” that serves
America’s true national interest is effective only if we believe in our
country’s inherent greatness and decency.</p>
<p>Finally, we want the restoration and reinvigoration of American
spiritual and cultural health, without which long-term security is
impossible. We want an America that cherishes its past glories and its
heroes, and that looks forward to a new golden age. We want a people who
are proud, happy, and optimistic that they will leave their country to
the next generation better than they found it. We want a gainfully
employed citizenry—with no one sitting on the sidelines—who take
satisfaction from knowing that their work is essential to the prosperity
of our nation and to the well-being of individuals and families. This
cannot be accomplished without growing numbers of strong, traditional
families that raise healthy children.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>What Do We Want In and From the World?</li>
</ol>
<p>Achieving these goals requires marshaling every resource of our
national power. Yet this strategy’s focus is foreign policy. What are
America’s core foreign policy interests? What do we want in and from the
world?</p>
<p>• We want to ensure that the Western Hemisphere remains reasonably
stable and well-governed enough to prevent and discourage mass migration
to the United States; we want a Hemisphere whose governments cooperate
with us against narco-terrorists, cartels, and other transnational
criminal organizations; we want a Hemisphere that remains free of
hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets, and that supports
critical supply chains; and we want to ensure our continued access to
key strategic locations. In other words, we will assert and enforce a
“Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine;</p>
<p>• We want to halt and reverse the ongoing damage that foreign actors
inflict on the American economy while keeping the Indo-Pacific free and
open, preserving freedom of navigation in all crucial sea lanes, and
maintaining secure and reliable supply chains and access to critical
materials;</p>
<p>• We want to support our allies in preserving the freedom and
security of Europe, while restoring Europe’s civilizational
self-confidence and Western identity;</p>
<p>• We want to prevent an adversarial power from dominating the Middle
East, its oil and gas supplies, and the chokepoints through which they
pass while avoiding the “forever wars” that bogged us down in that
region at great cost; and</p>
<p>• We want to ensure that U.S. technology and U.S.
standards—particularly in AI, biotech, and quantum computing—drive the
world forward.</p>
<p>These are the United States’ core, vital national interests. While we
also have others, these are the interests we must focus on above all
others, and that we ignore or neglect at our peril.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>What Are America’s Available Means to Get What We Want?</li>
</ol>
<p>America retains the world’s most enviable position, with
world-leading assets, resources, and advantages, including:</p>
<p>• A still nimble political system that can course correct;</p>
<p>• The world’s single largest and most innovative economy, which both
generates wealth we can invest in strategic interests and provides
leverage over countries that want access to our markets;</p>
<p>• The world’s leading financial system and capital markets, including
the dollar’s global reserve currency status;</p>
<p>• The world’s most advanced, most innovative, and most profitable
technology sector, which undergirds our economy, provides a qualitative
edge to our military, and strengthens our global influence;</p>
<p>• The world’s most powerful and capable military;</p>
<p>• A broad network of alliances, with treaty allies and partners in
the world’s most strategically important regions;</p>
<p>• An enviable geography with abundant natural resources, no competing
powers physically dominant in our Hemisphere, borders at no risk of
military invasion, and other great powers separated by vast oceans;</p>
<p>• Unmatched “soft power” and cultural influence; and</p>
<p>• The courage, willpower, and patriotism of the American people.</p>
<p>In addition, through President Trump’s robust domestic agenda, the
United States is:</p>
<p>• Re-instilling a culture of competence, rooting out so-called “DEI”
and other discriminatory and anti-competitive practices that degrade our
institutions and hold us back;</p>
<p>• Unleashing our enormous energy production capacity as a strategic
priority to fuel growth and innovation, and to bolster and rebuild the
middle class;</p>
<p>• Reindustrializing our economy, again to further support the middle
class and control our own supply chains and production capacities;</p>
<p>• Returning economic freedom to our citizens via historic tax cuts
and deregulatory efforts, making the United States the premier place to
do business and invest capital; and</p>
<p>• Investing in emerging technologies and basic science, to ensure our
continued prosperity, competitive advantage, and military dominance for
future generations.</p>
<p>The goal of this strategy is to tie together all of these
world-leading assets, and others, to strengthen American power and
preeminence and make our country even greater than it ever has been.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>The Strategy</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>Principles</li>
</ol>
<p>President Trump’s foreign policy is pragmatic without being
“pragmatist,” realistic without being “realist,” principled without
being “idealistic,” muscular without being “hawkish,” and restrained
without being “dovish.” It is not grounded in traditional, political
ideology. It is motivated above all by what works for America—or, in two
words, “America First.”</p>
<p>President Trump has cemented his legacy as The President of Peace. In
addition to the remarkable success achieved during his first term with
the historic Abraham Accords, President Trump has leveraged his
dealmaking ability to secure unprecedented peace in eight conflicts
throughout the world over the course of just eight months of his second
term. He negotiated peace between Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and
Serbia, the DRC and Rwanda, Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt
and Ethiopia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and ended the war in Gaza with all
living hostages returned to their families.</p>
<p>Stopping regional conflicts before they spiral into global wars that
drag down whole continents is worthy of the Commander-in-Chief’s
attention, and a priority for this administration. A world on fire,
where wars come to our shores, is bad for American interests. President
Trump uses unconventional diplomacy, America’s military might, and
economic leverage to surgically extinguish embers of division between
nuclear-capable nations and violent wars caused by centuries-long
hatred.</p>
<p>President Trump has proven that American foreign, defense, and
intelligence policies must be driven by the following basic
principles:</p>
<p>• Focused Definition of the National Interest – Since at least the
end of the Cold War, administrations have often published National
Security Strategies that seek to expand the definition of America’s
“national interest” such that that almost no issue or endeavor is
considered outside its scope. But to focus on everything is to focus on
nothing. America’s core national security interests shall be our
focus.</p>
<p>• Peace Through Strength – Strength is the best deterrent. Countries
or other actors sufficiently deterred from threatening American
interests will not do so. In addition, strength can enable us to achieve
peace, because parties that respect our strength often seek our help and
are receptive to our efforts to resolve conflicts and maintain peace.
Therefore, the United States must maintain the strongest economy,
develop the most advanced technologies, bolster our society’s cultural
health, and field the world’s most capable military.</p>
<p>• Predisposition to Non-Interventionism – In the Declaration of
Independence, America’s founders laid down a clear preference for non-
interventionism in the affairs of other nations and made clear the
basis: just as all human beings possess God-given equal natural rights,
all nations are entitled by “the laws of nature and nature’s God” to a
“separate and equal station” with respect to one another. For a country
whose interests are as numerous and diverse as ours, rigid adherence to
non-interventionism is not possible. Yet this predisposition should set
a high bar for what constitutes a justified intervention.</p>
<p>• Flexible Realism – U.S. policy will be realistic about what is
possible and desirable to seek in its dealings with other nations. We
seek good relations and peaceful commercial relations with the nations
of the world without imposing on them democratic or other social change
that differs widely from their traditions and histories. We recognize
and affirm that there is nothing inconsistent or hypocritical in acting
according to such a realistic assessment or in maintaining good
relations with countries whose governing systems and societies differ
from ours even as we push like-minded friends to uphold our shared
norms, furthering our interests as we do so.</p>
<p>• Primacy of Nations – The world’s fundamental political unit is and
will remain the nation-state. It is natural and just that all nations
put their interests first and guard their sovereignty. The world works
best when nations prioritize their interests. The United States will put
our own interests first and, in our relations with other nations,
encourage them to prioritize their own interests as well. We stand for
the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping
incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations, and for
reforming those institutions so that they assist rather than hinder
individual sovereignty and further American interests.</p>
<p>• Sovereignty and Respect – The United States will unapologetically
protect our own sovereignty. This includes preventing its erosion by
transnational and international organizations, attempts by foreign
powers or entities to censor our discourse or curtail our citizens’ free
speech rights, lobbying and influence operations that seek to steer our
policies or involve us in foreign conflicts, and the cynical
manipulation of our immigration system to build up voting blocs loyal to
foreign interests within our country. The United States will chart our
own course in the world and determine our own destiny, free of outside
interference.</p>
<p>• Balance of Power – The United States cannot allow any nation to
become so dominant that it could threaten our interests. We will work
with allies and partners to maintain global and regional balances of
power to prevent the emergence of dominant adversaries. As the United
States rejects the ill-fated concept of global domination for itself, we
must prevent the global, and in some cases even regional, domination of
others. This does not mean wasting blood and treasure to curtail the
influence of all the world’s great and middle powers. The outsized
influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations is a timeless truth of
international relations. This reality sometimes entails working with
partners to thwart ambitions that threaten our joint interests.</p>
<p>• Pro-American Worker – American policy will be pro-worker, not
merely pro-growth, and it will prioritize our own workers. We must
rebuild an economy in which prosperity is broadly based and widely
shared, not concentrated at the top or localized in certain industries
or a few parts of our country.</p>
<p>• Fairness – From military alliances to trade relations and beyond,
the United States will insist on being treated fairly by other
countries. We will no longer tolerate, and can no longer afford,
free-riding, trade imbalances, predatory economic practices, and other
impositions on our nation’s historic goodwill that disadvantage our
interests. As we want our allies to be rich and capable, so must our
allies see that it is in their interest that the United States also
remain rich and capable. In particular, we expect our allies to spend
far more of their national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on their own
defense, to start to make up for the enormous imbalances accrued over
decades of much greater spending by the United States.</p>
<p>• Competence and Merit – American prosperity and security depend on
the development and promotion of competence. Competence and merit are
among our greatest civilizational advantages: where the best Americans
are hired, promoted, and honored, innovation and prosperity follow.
Should competence be destroyed or systematically discouraged, complex
systems that we take for granted—from infrastructure to national
security to education and research—will cease to function. Should merit
be smothered, America’s historic advantages in science, technology,
industry, defense, and innovation will evaporate. The success of radical
ideologies that seek to replace competence and merit with favored group
status would render America unrecognizable and unable to defend itself.
At the same time, we cannot allow meritocracy to be used as a
justification to open America’s labor market to the world in the name of
finding “global talent” that undercuts American workers. In our every
principle and action, America and Americans must always come first.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Priorities</li>
</ol>
<p>• The Era of Mass Migration Is Over – Who a country admits into its
borders—in what numbers and from where—will inevitably define the future
of that nation. Any country that considers itself sovereign has the
right and duty to define its future. Throughout history, sovereign
nations prohibited uncontrolled migration and granted citizenship only
rarely to foreigners, who also had to meet demanding criteria. The
West’s experience over the past decades vindicates this enduring wisdom.
In countries throughout the world, mass migration has strained domestic
resources, increased violence and other crime, weakened social cohesion,
distorted labor markets, and undermined national security. The era of
mass migration must end. Border security is the primary element of
national security. We must protect our country from invasion, not just
from unchecked migration but from cross-border threats such as
terrorism, drugs, espionage, and human trafficking. A border controlled
by the will of the American people as implemented by their government is
fundamental to the survival of the United States as a sovereign
republic.</p>
<p>• Protection of Core Rights and Liberties – The purpose of the
American government is to secure the God-given natural rights of
American citizens. To this end, departments and agencies of the United
States Government have been granted fearsome powers. Those powers must
never be abused, whether under the guise of “deradicalization,”
“protecting our democracy,” or any other pretext. When and where those
powers are abused, abusers must be held accountable. In particular, the
rights of free speech, freedom of religion and of conscience, and the
right to choose and steer our common government are core rights that
must never be infringed. Regarding countries that share, or say they
share, these principles, the United States will advocate strongly that
they be upheld in letter and spirit. We will oppose elite-driven,
anti-democratic restrictions on core liberties in Europe, the
Anglosphere, and the rest of the democratic world, especially among our
allies.</p>
<p>• Burden-Sharing and Burden-Shifting – The days of the United States
propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over. We count among
our many allies and partners dozens of wealthy, sophisticated nations
that must assume primary responsibility for their regions and contribute
far more to our collective defense. President Trump has set a new global
standard with the Hague Commitment, which pledges NATO countries to
spend 5 percent of GDP on defense and which our NATO allies have
endorsed and must now meet. Continuing President Trump’s approach of
asking allies to assume primary responsibility for their regions, the
United States will organize a burden-sharing network, with our
government as convener and supporter. This approach ensures that burdens
are shared and that all such efforts benefit from broader legitimacy.
The model will be targeted partnerships that use economic tools to align
incentives, share burdens with like-minded allies, and insist on reforms
that anchor long-term stability. This strategic clarity will allow the
United States to counter hostile and subversive influences efficiently
while avoiding the overextension and diffuse focus that undermined past
efforts. The United States will stand ready to help— potentially through
more favorable treatment on commercial matters, technology sharing, and
defense procurement—those counties that willingly take more
responsibility for security in their neighborhoods and align their
export controls with ours.</p>
<p>• Realignment Through Peace – Seeking peace deals at the President’s
direction, even in regions and countries peripheral to our immediate
core interests, is an effective way to increase stability, strengthen
America’s global influence, realign countries and regions toward our
interests, and open new markets. The resources required boil down to
presidential diplomacy, which our great nation can embrace only with
competent leadership. The dividends—an end to longstanding conflicts,
lives saved, new friends made—can vastly outweigh the relatively minor
costs of time and attention.</p>
<p>• Economic Security – Finally, because economic security is
fundamental to national security, we will work to further strengthen the
American economy, with emphases on:</p>
<p>o Balanced Trade – The United States will prioritize rebalancing our
trade relations, reducing trade deficits, opposing barriers to our
exports, and ending dumping and other anti-competitive practices that
hurt American industries and workers. We seek fair, reciprocal trade
deals with nations that want to trade with us on a basis of mutual
benefit and respect. But our priorities must and will be our own
workers, our own industries, and our own national security.</p>
<p>o Securing Access to Critical Supply Chains and Materials – As
Alexander Hamilton argued in our republic’s earliest days, the United
States must never be dependent on any outside power for core
components—from raw materials to parts to finished products— necessary
to the nation’s defense or economy. We must re-secure our own
independent and reliable access to the goods we need to defend ourselves
and preserve our way of life. This will require expanding American
access to critical minerals and materials while countering predatory
economic practices. Moreover, the Intelligence Community will monitor
key supply chains and technological advances around the world to ensure
we understand and mitigate vulnerabilities and threats to American
security and prosperity.</p>
<p>o Reindustrialization – The future belongs to makers. The United
States will reindustrialize its economy, “re-shore” industrial
production, and encourage and attract investment in our economy and our
workforce, with a focus on the critical and emerging technology sectors
that will define the future. We will do so through the strategic use of
tariffs and new technologies that favor widespread industrial production
in every corner of our nation, raise living standards for American
workers, and ensure that our country is never again reliant on any
adversary, present or potential, for critical products or
components.</p>
<p>o Reviving our Defense Industrial Base – A strong, capable military
cannot exist without a strong, capable defense industrial base. The huge
gap, demonstrated in recent conflicts, between low-cost drones and
missiles versus the expensive systems required to defend against them
has laid bare our need to change and adapt. America requires a national
mobilization to innovate powerful defenses at low cost, to produce the
most capable and modern systems and munitions at scale, and to re-shore
our defense industrial supply chains. In particular, we must provide our
warfighters with the full range of capabilities, ranging from low-cost
weapons that can defeat most adversaries up to the most capable high-end
systems necessary for a conflict with a sophisticated enemy. And to
realize President Trump’s vision of peace through strength, we must do
so quickly. We will also encourage the revitalization of the industrial
bases of all our allies and partners to strengthen collective
defense.</p>
<p>o Energy Dominance – Restoring American energy dominance (in oil,
gas, coal, and nuclear) and reshoring the necessary key energy
components is a top strategic priority. Cheap and abundant energy will
produce well-paying jobs in the United States, reduce costs for American
consumers and businesses, fuel reindustrialization, and help maintain
our advantage in cutting-edge technologies such as AI. Expanding our net
energy exports will also deepen relationships with allies while
curtailing the influence of adversaries, protect our ability to defend
our shores, and—when and where necessary—enables us to project power. We
reject the disastrous “climate change” and “Net Zero” ideologies that
have so greatly harmed Europe, threaten the United States, and subsidize
our adversaries.</p>
<p>o Preserving and Growing America’s Financial Sector Dominance – The
United States boasts the world’s leading financial and capital markets,
which are pillars of American influence that afford policymakers
significant leverage and tools to advance America’s national security
priorities. But our leadership position cannot be taken for granted.
Preserving and growing our dominance entails leveraging our dynamic free
market system and our leadership in digital finance and innovation to
ensure that our markets continue to be the most dynamic, liquid, and
secure and remain the envy of the world.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Regions</li>
</ol>
<p>It has become customary for documents such as this to mention every
part of the world and issue, on the assumption that any oversight
signifies a blind spot or a snub. As a result, such documents become
bloated and unfocused—the opposite of what a strategy should be.</p>
<p>To focus and prioritize is to choose—to acknowledge that not
everything matters equally, to everyone. It is not to assert that any
peoples, regions, or countries are somehow intrinsically unimportant.
The United States is by every measure the most generous nation in
history—yet we cannot afford to be equally attentive to every region and
every problem in the world.</p>
<p>The purpose of national security policy is the protection of core
national interests—some priorities transcend regional confines. For
instance, terrorist activity in an otherwise less consequential area
might force our urgent attention. But leaping from that necessity to
sustained attention to the periphery is a mistake.</p>
<p>A. Western Hemisphere: The Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine</p>
<p>After years of neglect, the United States will reassert and enforce
the Monroe Doctrine to restore American preeminence in the Western
Hemisphere, and to protect our homeland and our access to key
geographies throughout the region. We will deny non-Hemispheric
competitors the ability to position forces or other threatening
capabilities, or to own or control strategically vital assets, in our
Hemisphere. This “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine is a
common-sense and potent restoration of American power and priorities,
consistent with American security interests.</p>
<p>Our goals for the Western Hemisphere can be summarized as “Enlist and
Expand.” We will enlist established friends in the Hemisphere to control
migration, stop drug flows, and strengthen stability and security on
land and sea. We will expand by cultivating and strengthening new
partners while bolstering our own nation’s appeal as the Hemisphere’s
economic and security partner of choice.</p>
<p>Enlist</p>
<p>American policy should focus on enlisting regional champions that can
help create tolerable stability in the region, even beyond those
partners’ borders. These nations would help us stop illegal and
destabilizing migration, neutralize cartels, near- shore manufacturing,
and develop local private economies, among other things. We will reward
and encourage the region’s governments, political parties, and movements
broadly aligned with our principles and strategy. But we must not
overlook governments with different outlooks with whom we nonetheless
share interests and who want to work with us.</p>
<p>The United States must reconsider our military presence in the
Western Hemisphere. This means four obvious things:</p>
<p>• A readjustment of our global military presence to address urgent
threats in our Hemisphere, especially the missions identified in this
strategy, and away from theaters whose relative import to American
national security has declined in recent decades or years;</p>
<p>• A more suitable Coast Guard and Navy presence to control sea lanes,
to thwart illegal and other unwanted migration, to reduce human and drug
trafficking, and to control key transit routes in a crisis;</p>
<p>• Targeted deployments to secure the border and defeat cartels,
including where necessary the use of lethal force to replace the failed
law enforcement-only strategy of the last several decades; and</p>
<p>• Establishing or expanding access in strategically important
locations.</p>
<p>The United States will prioritize commercial diplomacy, to strengthen
our own economy and industries, using tariffs and reciprocal trade
agreements as powerful tools. The goal is for our partner nations to
build up their domestic economies, while an economically stronger and
more sophisticated Western Hemisphere becomes an increasingly attractive
market for American commerce and investment.</p>
<p>Strengthening critical supply chains in this Hemisphere will reduce
dependencies and increase American economic resilience. The linkages
created between America and our partners will benefit both sides while
making it harder for non- Hemispheric competitors to increase their
influence in the region. And even as we prioritize commercial diplomacy,
we will work to strengthen our security partnerships—from weapons sales
to intelligence sharing to joint exercises.</p>
<p>Expand</p>
<p>As we deepen our partnerships with countries with whom America
presently has strong relations, we must look to expand our network in
the region. We want other nations to see us as their partner of first
choice, and we will (through various means) discourage their
collaboration with others.</p>
<p>The Western Hemisphere is home to many strategic resources that
America should partner with regional allies to develop, to make
neighboring countries as well as our own more prosperous. The National
Security Council will immediately begin a robust interagency process to
task agencies, supported by our Intelligence Community’s analytical arm,
to identify strategic points and resources in the Western Hemisphere
with a view to their protection and joint development with regional
partners.</p>
<p>Non-Hemispheric competitors have made major inroads into our
Hemisphere, both to disadvantage us economically in the present, and in
ways that may harm us strategically in the future. Allowing these
incursions without serious pushback is another great American strategic
mistake of recent decades.</p>
<p>The United States must be preeminent in the Western Hemisphere as a
condition of our security and prosperity—a condition that allows us to
assert ourselves confidently where and when we need to in the region.
The terms of our alliances, and the terms upon which we provide any kind
of aid, must be contingent on winding down adversarial outside
influence—from control of military installations, ports, and key
infrastructure to the purchase of strategic assets broadly defined.</p>
<p>Some foreign influence will be hard to reverse, given the political
alignments between certain Latin American governments and certain
foreign actors. However, many governments are not ideologically aligned
with foreign powers but are instead attracted to doing business with
them for other reasons, including low costs and fewer regulatory
hurdles. The United States has achieved success in rolling back outside
influence in the Western Hemisphere by demonstrating, with specificity,
how many hidden costs—in espionage, cybersecurity, debt-traps, and other
ways—are embedded in allegedly “low cost” foreign assistance. We should
accelerate these efforts, including by utilizing U.S. leverage in
finance and technology to induce countries to reject such
assistance.</p>
<p>In the Western Hemisphere—and everywhere in the world—the United
States should make clear that American goods, services, and technologies
are a far better buy in the long run, because they are higher quality
and do not come with the same kind of strings as other countries’
assistance. That said, we will reform our own system to expedite
approvals and licensing—again, to make ourselves the partner of first
choice. The choice all countries should face is whether they want to
live in an American-led world of sovereign countries and free economies
or in a parallel one in which they are influenced by countries on the
other side of the world.</p>
<p>Every U.S. official working in or on the region must be up to speed
on the full picture of detrimental outside influence while
simultaneously applying pressure and offering incentives to partner
countries to protect our Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Successfully protecting our Hemisphere also requires closer
collaboration between the U.S. Government and the American private
sector. All our embassies must be aware of major business opportunities
in their country, especially major government contracts. Every U.S.
Government official that interacts with these countries should
understand that part of their job is to help American companies compete
and succeed.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government will identify strategic acquisition and
investment opportunities for American companies in the region and
present these opportunities for assessment by every U.S. Government
financing program, including but not limited to those within the
Departments of State, War, and Energy; the Small Business
Administration; the International Development Finance Corporation; the
Export-Import Bank; and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. We should
also partner with regional governments and businesses to build scalable
and resilient energy infrastructure, invest in critical mineral access,
and harden existing and future cyber communications networks that take
full advantage of American encryption and security potential. The
aforementioned U.S. Government entities should be used to finance some
of the costs of purchasing U.S. goods abroad.</p>
<p>The United States must also resist and reverse measures such as
targeted taxation, unfair regulation, and expropriation that
disadvantage U.S. businesses. The terms of our agreements, especially
with those countries that depend on us most and therefore over which we
have the most leverage, must be sole-source contracts for our companies.
At the same time, we should make every effort to push out foreign
companies that build infrastructure in the region.</p>
<p>B. Asia: Win the Economic Future, Prevent Military Confrontation</p>
<p>Leading from a Position of Strength</p>
<p>President Trump single-handedly reversed more than three decades of
mistaken American assumptions about China: namely, that by opening our
markets to China, encouraging American business to invest in China, and
outsourcing our manufacturing to China, we would facilitate China’s
entry into the so-called “rules- based international order.” This did
not happen. China got rich and powerful, and used its wealth and power
to its considerable advantage. American elites—over four successive
administrations of both political parties—were either willing enablers
of China’s strategy or in denial.</p>
<p>The Indo-Pacific is already the source of almost half the world’s GDP
based on purchasing power parity (PPP), and one third based on nominal
GDP. That share is certain to grow over the 21st century. Which means
that the Indo-Pacific is already and will continue to be among the next
century’s key economic and geopolitical battlegrounds. To thrive at
home, we must successfully compete there—and we are. President Trump
signed major agreements during his October 2025 travels that further
deepen our powerful ties of commerce, culture, technology, and defense,
and reaffirm our commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>America retains tremendous assets—the world’s strongest economy and
military, world-beating innovation, unrivaled “soft power,” and a
historic record of benefiting our allies and partners—that enable us to
compete successfully.</p>
<p>President Trump is building alliances and strengthening partnerships
in the Indo- Pacific that will be the bedrock of security and prosperity
long into the future.</p>
<p>Economics: The Ultimate Stakes</p>
<p>Since the Chinese economy reopened to the world in 1979, commercial
relations between our two countries have been and remain fundamentally
unbalanced. What began as a relationship between a mature, wealthy
economy and one of the world’s poorest countries has transformed into
one between near-peers, even as, until very recently, America’s posture
remained rooted in those past assumptions.</p>
<p>China adapted to the shift in U.S. tariff policy that began in 2017
in part by strengthening its hold on supply chains, especially in the
world’s low- and middle- income (i.e., per capita GDP 3,800 or less)
countries—among the greatest economic battlegrounds of the coming
decades. China’s exports to low-income countries doubled between 2020
and 2024. The United States imports Chinese goods indirectly from
middlemen and Chinese-built factories in a dozen countries, including
Mexico. China’s exports to low-income countries are today nearly four
times its exports to the United States. When President Trump first took
office in 2017, China’s exports to the United States stood at 4 percent
of its GDP but have since fallen to slightly over 2 percent of its GDP.
China continues, however, to export to the United States through other
proxy countries.</p>
<p>Going forward, we will rebalance America’s economic relationship with
China, prioritizing reciprocity and fairness to restore American
economic independence. Trade with China should be balanced and focused
on non-sensitive factors. If America remains on a growth path—and can
sustain that while maintaining a genuinely mutually advantageous
economic relationship with Beijing—we should be headed from our present
0 trillion economy in 2025 to 0 trillion in the 2030s, putting our
country in an enviable position to maintain our status as the world’s
leading economy. Our ultimate goal is to lay the foundation for
long-term economic vitality.</p>
<p>Importantly, this must be accompanied by a robust and ongoing focus
on deterrence to prevent war in the Indo-Pacific. This combined approach
can become a virtuous cycle as strong American deterrence opens up space
for more disciplined economic action, while more disciplined economic
action leads to greater American resources to sustain deterrence in the
long term.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, several things are essential.</p>
<p>First, the United States must protect and defend our economy and our
people from harm, from any country or source. This means ending (among
other things):</p>
<p>• Predatory, state-directed subsidies and industrial strategies;</p>
<p>• Unfair trading practices;</p>
<p>• Job destruction and deindustrialization;</p>
<p>• Grand-scale intellectual property theft and industrial
espionage;</p>
<p>• Threats against our supply chains that risk U.S. access to critical
resources, including minerals and rare earth elements;</p>
<p>• Exports of fentanyl precursors that fuel America’s opioid epidemic;
and</p>
<p>• Propaganda, influence operations, and other forms of cultural
subversion.</p>
<p>Second, the United States must work with our treaty allies and
partners—who together add another 5 trillion in economic power to our
own 0 trillion national economy (together constituting more than half
the world economy)—to counteract predatory economic practices and use
our combined economic power to help safeguard our prime position in the
world economy and ensure that allied economies do not become subordinate
to any competing power. We must continue to improve commercial (and
other) relations with India to encourage New Delhi to contribute to
Indo-Pacific security, including through continued quadrilateral
cooperation with Australia, Japan, and the United States (“the Quad”).
Moreover, we will also work to align the actions of our allies and
partners with our joint interest in preventing domination by any single
competitor nation.</p>
<p>The United States must at the same time invest in research to
preserve and advance our advantage in cutting-edge military and dual-use
technology, with emphasis on the domains where U.S. advantages are
strongest. These include undersea, space, and nuclear, as well as others
that will decide the future of military power, such as AI, quantum
computing, and autonomous systems, plus the energy necessary to fuel
these domains.</p>
<p>Additionally, the U.S. Government’s critical relationships with the
American private sector help maintain surveillance of persistent threats
to U.S. networks, including critical infrastructure. This in turn
enables the U.S. Government’s ability to conduct real-time discovery,
attribution, and response (i.e., network defense and offensive cyber
operations) while protecting the competitiveness of the U.S. economy and
bolstering the resilience of the American technology sector.</p>
<p>Improving these capabilities will also require considerable
deregulation to further improve our competitiveness, spur innovation,
and increase access to America’s natural resources. In doing so, we
should aim to restore a military balance favorable to the United States
and to our allies in the region.</p>
<p>In addition to maintaining economic preeminence and consolidating our
alliance system into an economic group, the United States must execute
robust diplomatic and private sector-led economic engagement in those
countries where the majority of global economic growth is likely to
occur over the coming decades.</p>
<p>America First diplomacy seeks to rebalance global trade
relationships. We have made clear to our allies that America’s current
account deficit is unsustainable. We must encourage Europe, Japan,
Korea, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and other prominent nations in
adopting trade policies that help rebalance China’s economy toward
household consumption, because Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the
Middle East cannot alone absorb China’s enormous excess capacity. The
exporting nations of Europe and Asia can also look to middle-income
countries as a limited but growing market for their exports.</p>
<p>China’s state-led and state-backed companies excel in building
physical and digital infrastructure, and China has recycled perhaps .3
trillion of its trade surpluses into loans to its trading partners.
America and its allies have not yet formulated, much less executed, a
joint plan for the so-called “Global South,” but together possess
tremendous resources. Europe, Japan, South Korea, and others hold net
foreign assets of trillion. International financial institutions,
including the multilateral development banks, possess combined assets of
.5 trillion. While mission creep has undermined some of these
institutions’ effectiveness, this administration is dedicated to using
its leadership position to implement reforms that ensure they serve
American interests.</p>
<p>What differentiates America from the rest of the world—our openness,
transparency, trustworthiness, commitment to freedom and innovation, and
free market capitalism—will continue to make us the global partner of
first choice. America still holds the dominant position in the key
technologies that the world needs. We should present partners with a
suite of inducements—for instance, hightech cooperation, defense
purchases, and access to our capital markets—that tip decisions in our
favor.</p>
<p>President Trump’s May 2025 state visits to Persian Gulf countries
demonstrated the power and appeal of American technology. There, the
President won the</p>
<p>Gulf States’ support for America’s superior AI technology, deepening
our partnerships. America should similarly enlist our European and Asian
allies and partners, including India, to cement and improve our joint
positions in the Western Hemisphere and, with regard to critical
minerals, in Africa. We should form coalitions that use our comparative
advantages in finance and technology to build export markets with
cooperating countries. America’s economic partners should no longer
expect to earn income from the United States through overcapacity and
structural imbalances but instead pursue growth through managed
cooperation tied to strategic alignment and by receiving long-term U.S.
investment.</p>
<p>With the world’s deepest and most efficient capital markets, America
can help low- income countries develop their own capital markets and
bind their currencies more closely to the dollar, ensuring the dollar’s
future as the world’s reserve currency.</p>
<p>Our greatest advantages remain our system of government and dynamic
free market economy. Yet we cannot assume that our system’s advantages
will prevail by default. A national security strategy is, therefore,
essential.</p>
<p>Deterring Military Threats</p>
<p>In the long term, maintaining American economic and technological
preeminence is the surest way to deter and prevent a large-scale
military conflict.</p>
<p>A favorable conventional military balance remains an essential
component of strategic competition. There is, rightly, much focus on
Taiwan, partly because of Taiwan’s dominance of semiconductor
production, but mostly because Taiwan provides direct access to the
Second Island Chain and splits Northeast and Southeast Asia into two
distinct theaters. Given that one-third of global shipping passes
annually through the South China Sea, this has major implications for
the</p>
<p>U.S. economy. Hence deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by
preserving military overmatch, is a priority. We will also maintain our
longstanding declaratory policy on Taiwan, meaning that the United
States does not support any unilateral change to the status quo in the
Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>We will build a military capable of denying aggression anywhere in
the First Island Chain. But the American military cannot, and should not
have to, do this alone.</p>
<p>Our allies must step up and spend—and more importantly do—much more
for collective defense. America’s diplomatic efforts should focus on
pressing our First Island Chain allies and partners to allow the U.S.
military greater access to their ports and other facilities, to spend
more on their own defense, and most importantly to invest in
capabilities aimed at deterring aggression. This will interlink maritime
security issues along the First Island Chain while reinforcing</p>
<p>U.S. and allies’ capacity to deny any attempt to seize Taiwan or
achieve a balance of forces so unfavorable to us as to make defending
that island impossible.</p>
<p>A related security challenge is the potential for any competitor to
control the South China Sea. This could allow a potentially hostile
power to impose a toll system over one of the world’s most vital lanes
of commerce or—worse—to close and reopen it at will. Either of those two
outcomes would be harmful to the U.S. economy and broader U.S.
interests. Strong measures must be developed along with the deterrence
necessary to keep those lanes open, free of “tolls,” and not subject to
arbitrary closure by one country. This will require not just further
investment in our military—especially naval—capabilities, but also
strong cooperation with every nation that stands to suffer, from India
to Japan and beyond, if this problem is not addressed.</p>
<p>Given President Trump’s insistence on increased burden-sharing from
Japan and South Korea, we must urge these countries to increase defense
spending, with a focus on the capabilities—including new
capabilities—necessary to deter adversaries and protect the First Island
Chain. We will also harden and strengthen our military presence in the
Western Pacific, while in our dealings with Taiwan and Australia we
maintain our determined rhetoric on increased defense spending.</p>
<p>Preventing conflict requires a vigilant posture in the Indo-Pacific,
a renewed defense industrial base, greater military investment from
ourselves and from allies and partners, and winning the economic and
technological competition over the long term.</p>
<p>C. Promoting European Greatness</p>
<p>American officials have become used to thinking about European
problems in terms of insufficient military spending and economic
stagnation. There is truth to this, but Europe’s real problems are even
deeper.</p>
<p>Continental Europe has been losing share of global GDP—down from 25
percent in 1990 to 14 percent today—partly owing to national and
transnational regulations that undermine creativity and
industriousness.</p>
<p>But this economic decline is eclipsed by the real and more stark
prospect of civilizational erasure. The larger issues facing Europe
include activities of the European Union and other transnational bodies
that undermine political liberty and sovereignty, migration policies
that are transforming the continent and creating strife, censorship of
free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering
birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence.</p>
<p>Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable
in 20 years or less. As such, it is far from obvious whether certain
European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to
remain reliable allies. Many of these nations are currently doubling
down on their present path. We want Europe to remain European, to regain
its civilizational self-confidence, and to abandon its failed focus on
regulatory suffocation.</p>
<p>This lack of self-confidence is most evident in Europe’s relationship
with Russia. European allies enjoy a significant hard power advantage
over Russia by almost every measure, save nuclear weapons. As a result
of Russia’s war in Ukraine, European relations with Russia are now
deeply attenuated, and many Europeans regard Russia as an existential
threat. Managing European relations with Russia will require significant
U.S. diplomatic engagement, both to reestablish conditions of strategic
stability across the Eurasian landmass, and to mitigate the risk of
conflict between Russia and European states.</p>
<p>It is a core interest of the United States to negotiate an
expeditious cessation of hostilities in Ukraine, in order to stabilize
European economies, prevent unintended escalation or expansion of the
war, and reestablish strategic stability with Russia, as well as to
enable the post-hostilities reconstruction of Ukraine to enable its
survival as a viable state.</p>
<p>The Ukraine War has had the perverse effect of increasing Europe’s,
especially Germany’s, external dependencies. Today, German chemical
companies are building some of the world’s largest processing plants in
China, using Russian gas that they cannot obtain at home. The Trump
Administration finds itself at odds with European officials who hold
unrealistic expectations for the war perched in unstable minority
governments, many of which trample on basic principles of democracy to
suppress opposition. A large European majority wants peace, yet that
desire is not translated into policy, in large measure because of those
governments’ subversion of democratic processes. This is strategically
important to the United States precisely because European states cannot
reform themselves if they are trapped in political crisis.</p>
<p>Yet Europe remains strategically and culturally vital to the United
States. Transatlantic trade remains one of the pillars of the global
economy and of American prosperity. European sectors from manufacturing
to technology to energy remain among the world’s most robust. Europe is
home to cutting-edge scientific research and world-leading cultural
institutions. Not only can we not afford to write Europe off—doing so
would be self-defeating for what this strategy aims to achieve.</p>
<p>American diplomacy should continue to stand up for genuine democracy,
freedom of expression, and unapologetic celebrations of European
nations’ individual character and history. America encourages its
political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit, and the
growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for
great optimism.</p>
<p>Our goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory. We
will need a strong Europe to help us successfully compete, and to work
in concert with us to prevent any adversary from dominating Europe.</p>
<p>America is, understandably, sentimentally attached to the European
continent— and, of course, to Britain and Ireland. The character of
these countries is also strategically important because we count upon
creative, capable, confident, democratic allies to establish conditions
of stability and security. We want to work with aligned countries that
want to restore their former greatness.</p>
<p>Over the long term, it is more than plausible that within a few
decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority
non-European. As such, it is an open question whether they will view
their place in the world, or their alliance with the United States, in
the same way as those who signed the NATO charter.</p>
<p>Our broad policy for Europe should prioritize:</p>
<p>• Reestablishing conditions of stability within Europe and strategic
stability with Russia;</p>
<p>• Enabling Europe to stand on its own feet and operate as a group of
aligned sovereign nations, including by taking primary responsibility
for its own defense, without being dominated by any adversarial
power;</p>
<p>• Cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within
European nations;</p>
<p>• Opening European markets to U.S. goods and services and ensuring
fair treatment of U.S. workers and businesses;</p>
<p>• Building up the healthy nations of Central, Eastern, and Southern
Europe through commercial ties, weapons sales, political collaboration,
and cultural and educational exchanges;</p>
<p>• Ending the perception, and preventing the reality, of NATO as a
perpetually expanding alliance; and</p>
<p>• Encouraging Europe to take action to combat mercantilist
overcapacity, technological theft, cyber espionage, and other hostile
economic practices.</p>
<p>D. The Middle East: Shift Burdens, Build Peace</p>
<p>For half a century at least, American foreign policy has prioritized
the Middle East above all other regions. The reasons are obvious: the
Middle East was for decades the world’s most important supplier of
energy, was a prime theater of superpower competition, and was rife with
conflict that threatened to spill into the wider world and even to our
own shores.</p>
<p>Today, at least two of those dynamics no longer hold. Energy supplies
have diversified greatly, with the United States once again a net energy
exporter. Superpower competition has given way to great power jockeying,
in which the United States retains the most enviable position,
reinforced by President Trump’s successful revitalization of our
alliances in the Gulf, with other Arab partners, and with Israel.</p>
<p>Conflict remains the Middle East’s most troublesome dynamic, but
there is today less to this problem than headlines might lead one to
believe. Iran—the region’s chief destabilizing force—has been greatly
weakened by Israeli actions since October 7, 2023, and President Trump’s
June 2025 Operation Midnight Hammer, which significantly degraded Iran’s
nuclear program. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains thorny, but
thanks to the ceasefire and release of hostages President Trump
negotiated, progress toward a more permanent peace has been made.
Hamas’s chief backers have been weakened or stepped away. Syria remains
a potential problem, but with American, Arab, Israeli, and Turkish
support may stabilize and reassume its rightful place as an integral,
positive player in the region.</p>
<p>As this administration rescinds or eases restrictive energy policies
and American energy production ramps up, America’s historic reason for
focusing on the Middle East will recede. Instead, the region will
increasingly become a source and destination of international
investment, and in industries well beyond oil and gas— including nuclear
energy, AI, and defense technologies. We can also work with Middle East
partners to advance other economic interests, from securing supply
chains to bolstering opportunities to develop friendly and open markets
in other parts of the world such as Africa.</p>
<p>Middle East partners are demonstrating their commitment to combatting
radicalism, a trendline American policy should continue to encourage.
But doing so will require dropping America’s misguided experiment with
hectoring these nations—especially the Gulf monarchies—into abandoning
their traditions and historic forms of government. We should encourage
and applaud reform when and where it emerges organically, without trying
to impose it from without. The key to successful relations with the
Middle East is accepting the region, its leaders, and its nations as
they are while working together on areas of common interest.</p>
<p>America will always have core interests in ensuring that Gulf energy
supplies do not fall into the hands of an outright enemy, that the
Strait of Hormuz remain open, that the Red Sea remain navigable, that
the region not be an incubator or exporter of terror against American
interests or the American homeland, and that Israel remain secure. We
can and must address this threat ideologically and militarily without
decades of fruitless “nation-building” wars. We also have a clear
interest in expanding the Abraham Accords to more nations in the region
and to other countries in the Muslim world.</p>
<p>But the days in which the Middle East dominated American foreign
policy in both long-term planning and day-to-day execution are
thankfully over—not because the Middle East no longer matters, but
because it is no longer the constant irritant, and potential source of
imminent catastrophe, that it once was. It is rather emerging as a place
of partnership, friendship, and investment—a trend that should be
welcomed and encouraged. In fact, President Trump’s ability to unite the
Arab world at Sharm el-Sheikh in pursuit of peace and normalization will
allow the United States to finally prioritize American interests.</p>
<p>E. Africa</p>
<p>For far too long, American policy in Africa has focused on providing,
and later on spreading, liberal ideology. The United States should
instead look to partner with select countries to ameliorate conflict,
foster mutually beneficial trade relationships, and transition from a
foreign aid paradigm to an investment and growth paradigm capable of
harnessing Africa’s abundant natural resources and latent economic
potential.</p>
<p>Opportunities for engagement could include negotiating settlements to
ongoing conflicts (e.g., DRC-Rwanda, Sudan), and preventing new ones
(e.g., Ethiopia- Eritrea-Somalia), as well as action to amend our
approach to aid and investment (e.g., the Africa Growth and Opportunity
Act). And we must remain wary of resurgent Islamist terrorist activity
in parts of Africa while avoiding any long-term American presence or
commitments.</p>
<p>The United States should transition from an aid-focused relationship
with Africa to a trade- and investment-focused relationship, favoring
partnerships with capable, reliable states committed to opening their
markets to U.S. goods and services. An immediate area for U.S.
investment in Africa, with prospects for a good return on investment,
include the energy sector and critical mineral development.</p>
<p>Development of U.S.-backed nuclear energy, liquid petroleum gas, and
liquified natural gas technologies can generate profits for U.S.
businesses and help us in the competition for critical minerals and
other resources.</p>

<p>But he warned that while the “surprising move“ made sense for Warner

<p>Warner Bros rejected this move before putting itself up for sale.</p>
<p>Ahead of the announcement of the deal, Tom Harrington, head of
television at Enders Analysis, said it was hard to gauge whether the
takeover would be approved by regulators, but if it went through it
would have a massive impact on cinema.</p>

<p>“Were it to go through it would reorient Hollywood,“ he said.</p>
<p>Mr Harrington said there was likely to be “big reductions“ in
television and film output from a newly-merged company, which would lead
to resistance to the move from parts of Hollywood and relevant
unions.</p>

</ul>
<p>For consumers, Mr Harrington said <strong>a merger was likely to lead
to higher prices.</strong></p>
<p>“Netflix would get more expensive and even though HBO Max would be

was a “major priority“ for India.</p>

additional 25% later as a penalty for Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil -
a move the Indian government called “unfair, unjustified and

<p>In his interview with India Today, Putin commented on the US tariffs
on India for buying Russian oil, and said that India should have the

<p>“The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own

shouldn’t India have the same privilege?,“ he asked.</p>

also be launched in India, the prime minister said.</p>
<p>No major defence deals were announced, but the two men said there
were agreements signed on shipbuilding, investments in civil nuclear

“wasting the world’s time“, while Ukraine’s ambassador to the US said

ambassador Olga Stefanishyna said, but that they were ongoing.</p>

war“, but negotiations must be “backed by pressure on Russia“.</p>

says it will be less safe for kids under Australia’s social media
ban</h3>
<p>YouTube says Australia’s “rushed“ new laws to block teens from its
platform will mean children will be less safe as its “robust parental
controls“ will be stripped away.</p>
<ul>
<li>strip,英 [strɪp] 美 [strɪp] v.
除去，撕掉（外皮或表层）；夺去，剥夺（地位，权力，财产）；脱衣服，脱光……的衣服；表演脱衣舞；为（奶牛）收奶；拆卸，拆开（机器、车辆或引擎

<p>Parents will “lose their ability to supervise their teen or tween’s
account“ such as content settings or blocking channels from 10 December
when a social media ban for under-16s starts. Children will still be
able to view videos but without an account.</p>
<p>Communications Minister Anika Wells responded by saying it was
“outright weird“ that YouTube was highlighting the dangers of its
platform for children.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>outright,英 [ˈaʊtraɪt] 美 [ˈaʊtraɪt] adj.

n. 命运；预言者</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“If YouTube is reminding us all that it is not safe … that’s a
problem that YouTube needs to fix,“ Wells said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The platform’s statement comes as Australia’s internet regulator sets
her sights on two little-known apps that teens have flocked to in the
lead-up to the country’s social media ban.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>regulator,英 [ˈreɡjuleɪtə(r)] 美 [ˈreɡjuleɪtər]
n. （某行业的）监管者，监管机构；调节器，校准器</p></li>

v. 群集，蜂拥</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Lemon8, owned by the creators behind TikTok, and Yope are video and
photo-sharing apps that have seen a rise in downloads recently,
prompting eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant to ask them to
self-assess if they fall under the ban.</p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, the video-sharing platform said it would
comply but that the new law undermined more than a decade’s work in
building “robust protections and parental controls that families rely on
for a safer YouTube experience“.</p>
<ul>
<li>comply,英 [kəmˈplaɪ] 美 [kəmˈplaɪ] v.

</ul>
<p>“Most importantly, this law will not fulfil its promise to make kids
safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on
YouTube,“ wrote Rachel Lord, public policy senior manager at Google and
YouTube Australia, adding that parents and educators shared these
concerns.</p>
<p>She labelled the ban - which comes under the Social Media Minimum Age
Act - as “rushed regulation that misunderstands our platform and the way
young Australians use it“.</p>
<ul>
<li>regulation,英 [ˌreɡjuˈleɪʃ(ə)n] 美 [ˌreɡjuˈleɪʃn]
n. 规章制度，规则；（运用规则条例的）管理，控制</li>
</ul>
<p>From 10 December, anyone under 16 will be automatically signed out of
their YouTube account, meaning they cannot upload content or post
comments. YouTube Kids is not part of the ban.</p>
<p>In addition, default wellbeing settings such as reminders to take a
break or go to bed will no longer be available to children as they only
work for account holders.</p>
<ul>
<li>wellbeing n. 幸福；福利；安乐；健康</li>
</ul>
<p>Ms Lord said the legislation had “failed to allow for adequate
consultation and consideration of the real complexities of online safety
regulation.“</p>
<ul>
<li>legislation,英 [ˌledʒɪsˈleɪʃn] 美 [ˌledʒɪsˈleɪʃ(ə)n]
n. 法规，法律；立法，制订法律</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube’s parent company, Google, has reportedly considered launching
a legal challenge to the platform’s inclusion in the ban. It did not
respond to a BBC request for comment.</p>
<ul>
<li>inclusion,英 [ɪnˈkluːʒn] 美 [ɪnˈkluːʒ(ə)n]
n. 包含，包括；包含物，包括的人；认同感，归属感</li>
</ul>
<p>In a speech on Wednesday, exactly a week before the ban kicks in,
Wells said teething problems were expected in the first few days and
weeks.</p>
<p>“<strong>Regulation, and cultural change, takes time. Takes
patience</strong>,“ she said.</p>
<p>Wells said Gen Alpha - anyone under 15 years - were connected to a
“dopamine drip“ from the moment they got a smartphone and social media
accounts.</p>
<p>Previous generations had dealt with bullying or potentially harmful
content but it was limited, she said. New technology meant children
today had “constant access“ with algorithms and notifications “stealing
their attention for hours every day“.</p>
<p>“With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into
purgatory by the predatory algorithms</p>
<p>Tech companies will have to provide regular six-monthly reports on
how many accounts they have for under-16s, she said.</p>
<p>Under the ban, tech companies can be fined up to A9.5m (US3m, £25m)
if they don’t comply with the age restrictions. They will need to
deactivate existing accounts and prohibit any new accounts, as well as
stopping any work arounds.</p>
<p>The other platforms that fall under the ban are Facebook, Instagram,
TikTok, Snapchat, X, Twitch, Threads, Reddit and Kick.</p>

<p>It’s a time of great turbulence. It sees the Sun transition from calm
to stormy and is marked by a huge increase in the number of solar storms
and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) - massive bubbles of fire that blow
out of the Sun’s outermost layer called corona.</p>
<p>Made up of charged particles, a CME can weigh up to a trillion
kilograms and can attain a speed of up to 3,000km (1,864 miles) per
second. It can head out in any direction, including towards the Earth.
At top speed, it would take a CME 15 hours to cover the 150 million km
Earth-Sun distance.</p>
<p>“In the normal or low-activity times, the Sun launches two to three
CMEs a day,“ says Prof R Ramesh of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics
(IIA). “Next year, we expect them to be 10 or more daily.“</p>
<p>Prof Ramesh is the principal investigator on Visible Emission Line
Coronagraph, or Velc - the most important of the seven scientific
instruments on Aditya-L1 - and closely monitors and decodes the data it
gathers.</p>
<p>Studying CMEs is one of the most important scientific objectives of
India’s maiden solar mission, he says. One, because the ejections
provide an opportunity to learn about the star at the centre of our
solar system, and two, because activities that take place on the Sun
threaten infrastructure on Earth and in space.</p>
<p>CMEs rarely pose a direct threat to human life, but they do affect
life on Earth by causing geomagnetic storms that impact the weather in
near space, where nearly 11,000 satellites,</p>
<p>“The most beautiful manifestations of a CME are auroras, which are a
clear example that charged particles from Sun are travelling to Earth,“
Prof Ramesh explains.</p>
<p>“But they can also make all the electronics on a satellite
malfunction, knock down power grids and affect weather and communication
satellites.“</p>
<p>The most powerful solar storm ever recorded was the</p>
<p>In February 2022,</p>
<p>Prof Ramesh says that if we are able to see what happens on the Sun’s
corona and spot a solar storm or a coronal mass ejection in real time,
record its temperature at origin and watch its trajectory, it can work
as a forewarning to switch off power grids and satellites and move them
out of harm’s way.</p>
<p>There are other solar missions watching the Sun, but Aditya-L1 has an
advantage over others, including the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
sent jointly by Nasa and Esa (European Space Agency), when it comes to
watching the corona.</p>
<p>“Aditya-L1’s coronagraph is the exact size that lets it nearly mimic
the Moon, fully covering the Sun’s photosphere and allowing it an
uninterrupted view of almost all of the corona 24 hours a day, 365 days
a year, even during eclipses and occultations,“ says Prof Ramesh.</p>
<p>In other words, the coronagraph acts like an artificial Moon,
blocking the Sun’s bright surface to let scientists continuously observe
its faint outer corona - something the real Moon does only during
eclipses.</p>
<p>Moreover, this is the only mission that can study eruptions in
visible light, letting it measure a CME’s temperature and heat energy -
key clues that show how strong a CME would be if it headed toward Earth,
says Prof Ramesh.</p>
<p>To prepare for next year’s peak solar activity period, the IIA
collaborated with Nasa to study the data it gathered from one of the
largest CMEs that Aditya-L1 has recorded until now.</p>
<p>It originated on 13 September 2024 at 00:30 GMT, Prof Ramesh says.
Its mass was 270 million tonnes - the iceberg that sank Titanic was 1.5
million tonnes, he says.</p>
<p>At origin, its temperature was 1.8 million degrees Celsius and the
energy content was equivalent to 2.2 million megatons of TNT – in
comparison, the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 15 kilotons
and 21 kilotons respectively.</p>
<p>Even though the numbers make it sound incredibly large, Prof Ramesh
describes it as a “medium-sized“ one.</p>
<p>The asteroid which wiped out the dinosaurs on Earth was 100 million
megatons and during the Sun’s maximum activity cycle, he says, we could
see CMEs with energy content equal to even more than that.</p>
<p>“I consider the CME we evaluated to have occurred when the Sun was in
the normal activity phase. Now this sets the benchmark that we’ll be
using to evaluate what is in store when the maximum activity cycle
occurs,“ he says.</p>
<p>“The learnings from this will help us work out the countermeasures to
be adopted to protect satellites in near space. They will also help us
gain a better understanding of near-Earth space,“ he adds.</p>

</ul>
<p>While the first of these specifically targeted Afghans seeking to
enter the US, other decisions have been far more wide-reaching.</p>
<p>The USCIS - a branch of the Department of Homeland Security - has
been told not to approve, deny or close asylum applications it receives
for all nationalities, according CBS News, the BBC’s US partner.</p>
<p>Its officers can continue to work on asylum applications and review
cases up to the point of making a decision, CBS reported.</p>
<p>But few details are known about Friday’s directive.</p>
<p>Trump did not name which countries might be affected by his migration
pause, which could face legal challenges and has already prompted
pushback from UN agencies.</p>
<p>The US president’s recent announcements represent a further
toughening of his stance towards migrants during his second
presidency.</p>
<p>Trump has also sought to enact mass deportations of illegal migrants,
cut the annual number of refugee admissions, and to end automatic
citizenship rights currently applicable to many born on US
territory.</p>
<p>Following Wednesday’s fatal attack, the Trump administration
temporarily stopped issuing visas to Afghans through the same programme
the shooting suspect had, before suspending all immigration requests
from Afghans pending a review.</p>
<p>Then on Thursday, the USCIS said it would re-examine green cards
issued to individuals who had migrated to the US from 19 countries,
without mentioning Wednesday’s attack.</p>
<p>The agency referred to a June proclamation that included</p>
<p>Trump then pledged to “end all federal benefits and subsidies to
non-citizens“ on Thursday.</p>
<p>Trump blamed refugees for causing the “social dysfunction in America“
and vowed to remove “anyone who is not a net asset“ to the US.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia were completely
taking over the once great State of Minnesota,“ he said.</p>
<p>“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to
allow the U.S. system to fully recover.“</p>
<p>The phrase “third world“ is one previously used to describe poorer,
developing nations.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a travel ban was imposed on nationals primarily
from 11 African and Asian nations, including Afghanistan. During Trump’s
first term, he enacted a travel ban targeting multiple Muslim-majority
countries.</p>
<p>The UN has urged the US to</p>
<p>Trump’s reaction to the shooting amounted to a “scapegoating“ of
migrants in the US, argued Jeremy McKinney, the former president of the
American Immigration Lawyers Association.</p>
<p>He told the BBC World Service’s Newsday programme before Trump’s
latest remarks that the attacker’s motive were unclear, and that
radicalisation and mental illness could affect anyone.</p>
<p>“These types of issues - they don’t know skin colour, they don’t know
nationality.“</p>
<p>Officials said the shooting suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, came to
the US in 2021.</p>
<p>He travelled under a programme that offered special protections to
Afghans who had worked with US forces in Afghanistan before their
chaotic withdrawal and the return to power of the Taliban.</p>
<p>Mr Lakanwal had been a member of a “Zero Unit“ - an Afghan
intelligence and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA - a former
Afghan defence and security forces member told CBS.</p>
<p>The US considered Zero Units to be among the most respected domestic
forces in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The CIA’s current director has confirmed that he previously worked
with the US intelligence agency.</p>
<p>He would have been vetted by the US both when he started working with
the CIA and when he travelled to the US, a senior US official told
CNN.</p>
<p>A childhood friend told the New York Times that Mr Lakanwal had
experienced mental health issues after his work with his unit.</p>
<p>Mr Lakanwal was reportedly granted asylum after Trump returned to
office, having applied in 2024.</p>
<p>But his request for a green card - which shows a person has permanent
residence in the US - is pending, an official told CBS.</p>

<p>Both social media users and content creators say they’re worried that
AI slop flooding feeds is leading to a less authentic online experience
- and is drowning out real posts.</p>
<p>But a new trend, which sees people adding AI-generated animals to
original photographs, has encouraged some content creators to embrace
AI.</p>
<p>“I was like, that’s really niche because it looks so real,“
influencer Zoe Ilana Hill says.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old jumped on the trend after being impressed by the
imaginative way another content creator had used AI, by editing some of
her original photos and adding AI dogs.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see it [AI] as a threat to my career, I want to see
it as something I can work alongside with,“ the full-time influencer
says.</p>
<p>Zoe, who has 82,000 followers, says she feels like platforms such as
Facebook, Instagram and TikTok are trying to “push“ and “force AI“ on
users, and has seen her fair share of slop her own feed.</p>
<p>But she saw potential in the AI animal trend, adding that she
suspected the post would perform well as she thought social media users
would “be like, oh my God, she’s holding a deer“.</p>
<p>“The deer is so seasonal and that is so rare to be actually able to
go and physically see a deer in person,“ she says.</p>
<p>Zoe says her post was a success - with more than 20,000 likes and
comments including: “No stop this is the cutest thing ever“ and “this
trend is adorable!!!!“</p>
<p>Whenever Zoe posts a photo made with AI, she likes to make it clear
it’s a generated image, “there is actually a tag [on Instagram] where
you can say this photo was created by AI“.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s fair for people to think that something’s real
when it’s not.“</p>
<p>When influencers don’t disclose the use of AI - it can cause
confusion.</p>
<p>That was the case with one German influencer, with 900,000 followers,
posted a picture with dozens of AI dalmatians captioned: “just me,
living my dream“.</p>
<p>One user commented asking: “Is it AI? I saw a post like this three
times today.“</p>
<p>Another replied concerned for the generated animals’ welfare, adding
“there are plenty of dogs sitting in animal shelters who would like to
have a nice home“.</p>
<p>“Hot girls have started using AI,“ wrote one X user discussing the
trend by sharing animal photos from various influencers in a post viewed
almost 27 million times.</p>
<p>But not everyone sees using AI this way as harmless fun.</p>
<p>Another X user responded: “They are not hot because they use AI for
mindless slop that could easily be done by hand with Photoshop.“</p>
<p>Clara Sandell, a marketing professional and digital creator from
Finland took part in the trend after she saw it “everywhere“ and found
the posts “so cute“.</p>
<p>“I kind of put my own twist [on the trend], I used my spirit animals
and my favourite animals,“ the 38-year-old adds.</p>
<p>Clara posted a carousel photo on Instagram with tigers, an elk, a
horse, and cats and dogs.</p>
<p>Reaction from the photos were positive, with many labelling the post
as “chic“ and “beautiful“.</p>
<p>When asked if she would participate in future AI trends she replied
“depending on how cute the trend is,“ and if it was transparent so that
you can “see it’s AI“ being used.</p>
<p>For content creators looking to create high-quality images, social
media consultant Matt Navarra thinks that AI makes it easier to produce
“fantastical high gloss“ and “aesthetic“ content for influencers,
“whether it’s wild animals generated, through to something that’s much
more believable“.</p>
<p>Whilst some of the AI content we see online is unrealistic and
evidentially not real, Mr Navarra says “most people who are serious
about being a creator or an influencer want to maintain a
reputation“.</p>
<p>He believes many creators are “doubling down on the realness“ to give
themselves a place on the feed amongst “a sea of AI-generated content
which is flooding or AI slop as it’s been termed“.</p>
<p>The consultant says he predicts 2026 will be the year of AI dominated
content on social media, adding: “If you thought that AI animal content
was quirky, I think buckle up“.</p>
<p>But not everyone will be pleased to hear this.</p>
<p>Maddi Mathers, a tattoo artist from Melbourne commented “love you but
not the AI“ under the same German influencers post who created the AI
dalmatians.</p>
<p>Commenting isn’t something that Maddi, who describes herself as a
“very silent social media user“ would normally do.</p>
<p>But when the tattoo artist first saw the photo, she believed it was
real before but scrolling through the posts revealed the cute dalmatians
were “obviously very fake“.</p>
<p>“Honestly, it’s such a simple thing but it makes you feel dumb when
you get fooled by AI,“ the 25- year-old explains.</p>
<p>Maddi says such AI posts create an element of mistrust because
“there’s such an importance of being true to yourself and showing your
true personality“ when being an influencer.</p>
<p>She believes that when creators put out content that isn’t real it
can be “damaging for their career“ as their audience “won’t know what to
believe anymore“.</p>
<p>AI slop isn’t necessarily a bad thing - “but the speed and volume of
what we’re creating“ is what concerns creative health scientist Katina
Bajaj.</p>
<p>“When we’re creating and consuming AI-generated content at such a
rapid pace, we aren’t giving our brains enough time to digest,“ Mrs
Bajaj says.</p>
<p>She explains that from her perspective, the solution to AI slop isn’t
to ban it or “look down upon AI tools,“ but to “prioritise and value our
creative health more than generating endless content“.</p>
<p>There is currently no requirement “to label images that have been
created or altered with AI“ on Instagram, according to Meta’s
policy.</p>
<p>However, “images will still receive a label if Meta’s systems detect
that they were AI-generated“.</p>
<p>TikTok has recently launched a new tool which allows users to shape
their feed - this includes being able to see more or less AI generated
content.</p>
<p>The ‘Manage Topics’ feature is intended to help people tailor their
‘for you page’ to ensure users have a range of content in their feed,
rather than removing or replacing content entirely.</p>
<p>There is a lot of AI software that can be used to make this trend,
but not all can create the flawless content social media is
portraying.</p>
<p>Emily Manns, a fashion content creator from the US, didn’t quite get
what she bargained for when she bought multiple AI apps to join in with
the trend and received “one single rodent“ in what was meant to be an
aesthetic photo.</p>
<p>“I don’t even know what [the animal] was,“ said the 34-year-old.</p>
<p>“It [the photo] took like 2 minutes to load, and when it loaded, I
was peeing my pants of laughter.“</p>
<p>The app also added an extra finger onto the influencers hand, and
distorted her face.</p>
<p>Emily says she posted the photo to her Instagram but “deleted it
instantly“ because the content wasn’t engaging very well.</p>

<p>The report attributes this to increasingly challenging economic
environments which provide “temptation“ for consumers to act
fraudulently.</p>
<ul>
<li>temptation,英 [tempˈteɪʃ(ə)n] 美 [tempˈteɪʃ(ə)n]

</ul>
<p>Across the finance industry, companies are popping up to try and take
on the issue of friendly fraud, and to sell solutions to businesses.</p>
<p>Ariel Chen, CEO of Chargeflow, explains how he became involved in
fighting fraud: “We built a fast-growing global beauty brand with a
subscription box loved by hundreds of thousands of customers. And then
the chargebacks hit.“</p>
<p>He described how these chargebacks were “not the criminal kind“, but
“the sneaky kind“, with a simple click of “I didn’t receive“, costing
his former business greatly.</p>
<ul>
<li>sneaky,英 [ˈsniːki] 美 [ˈsniːki] adj.
鬼鬼祟祟的；暗中的，卑鄙的</li>
</ul>
<p>He turned his skills to developing a defence for businesses, which he
now sells.</p>
<p>A cardholder caught trying to commit this type of fraud could find
their account closed and their credit-rating record affected.</p>
<p>According to Payment technology firm SOTPay: “Whilst the individual
cardholder might think that filing the odd friendly fraud is ‘no big
deal’ or victimless, it is essentially stealing, a crime.“</p>

can be severe.</p>

<p>According to Stuart-Miller Solicitors, credit card fraud is

<p>Adam Scarrot of UK Finance told BBC Radio London, “It’s what we call
friendly fraud, but it’s still a fraud, and every fraud has a
victim.“</p>

</ul>
<p>“The enquirer will then look at that, and then they will have to pass

<p>He said the system was designed to try and create an “even balance“
between protecting “genuine consumers and genuine merchants“.</p>
<p>He advised businesses to develop a prevention strategy.</p>

<p>Chargeback scams target all types of business, but are particularly

<p>Once cats became associated with people, they were moved around the
world, prized as ship cats and pest controllers. Cats only reached
Europe around 2,000 years ago, much later than previously thought.</p>
<p>They travelled around Europe and into the UK with the Romans and then
started moving east along the Silk Road into China.</p>

<p>Añelo is located in the heart of Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 sq km (12,000
sq mi) oil and gas-rich geological formation. It was first discovered as
far back as 1931, but it wasn’t until fracking became legal in Argentina
in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed.</p>

</ul>
<p>Fracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US
in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and
chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the
rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the
surface.</p>
<p>The first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation
between Argentina’s majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos
Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron.</p>
<p>By February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production
in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of
these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas.</p>

</ul>
<p>This accounts “for more than half of Argentina’s oil and gas
production“, says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria
consultancy and a former YPF official.</p>

</ul>
<p>He adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional
extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very
old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to.</p>
<ul>
<li>conventional,英 [kənˈvenʃən(ə)l] 美 [kənˈvenʃən(ə)l] adj.

</ul>
<p>Nicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet
specialising in energy, agrees. “We have not been able to find new
conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception
of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin,“ he says.
“All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than
Vaca Muerta.“</p>

</ul>
<p>The oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy
self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for
expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas,
helping it to earn foreign currency.</p>
<p>“Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy
sector of bn [£4.6bn],“ says Mr Gadano. “This year, we are aiming for a
similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop
in international prices.“</p>

</ul>
<p>Mr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy
than it imports “is very important“ for the country, “especially when
two or three years ago we were in the red“. Yet he adds that it won’t be
“the panacea“ that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high
inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt.</p>

<p>“However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more

agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not
been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond

<p>“Companies say ‘everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven’t
been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we

<p>Gustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town
of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial
government “is doing what it has to do and what it can do“.</p>
<p>What continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a
political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. “All

to grow,“ notes Mr Gadano.</p>

be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that
Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and
downs.</strong>“</p>

Schlossberg essay raises awareness of acute myeloid leukemia</h3>
<p>Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of former US President John F
Kennedy, moved many Americans over the weekend with her emotional essay
about being diagnosed with terminal cancer shortly after giving birth to
her second child.</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>Doctors and researchers say the essay helped raise awareness about
the deadly illness and critical need for more funding and research to
tackle treatment-resistant cancers.</p>
<p>“It’s such an obviously moving and courageous essay,“ said Vijay
Sankaran, a physician with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “She comes from
a very prominent family, and yet anybody can be affected by cancer, even
people who are young, who are seemingly healthy.“</p>
<p>In the essay, titled A Battle With My Blood, Schlossberg said she was
diagnosed after doctors noticed an abnormally high white-blood cell
count after giving birth to her daughter in May 2024.</p>
<p>The daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline
Kennedy, she said she was shocked by the diagnosis, as she considered
herself “one of the healthiest people I knew“.</p>
<p>One of the dangers of acute myeloid leukaemias is that they can
emerge suddenly, going from being undetactable to affecting hundreds of
cells in a matter of days, said Dr Sankaran.</p>
<p>The cancer - affecting both the bone marrow and blood - is rare,
sickening four in 100,000 adults each year.</p>
<p>Schlossberg’s subtype of leukaemia - a chromosomal abnormality
formerly called Inversion 3 - is even rarer, affecting only 1% to 2% of
people with acute myeloid leukaemia.</p>
<p>The rare genetic mutation makes Schlossberg’s cancer even more
dangerous. It is one of the few subsets of acute myeloid leukaemia for
which there are few effective therapies - meaning remissions or cures
“are the minority“, said Courtney DiNardo, professor of leukaemia at
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p>
<p>The most common treatments involve bone marrow transplants,
chemotherapy and clinical trials.</p>
<p>Schlossberg tried them all.</p>
<p>She described in her essay the transplant doctors drained from her
sister’s arms and chemotherapy that made her once “great hair“ fall
out.</p>
<p>She joined a clinical trial for CAR-T-cell therapy, a type of
immunotherapy for certain blood cancers, in which she said scientists
“engineered my sister’s T-cells, directing them to attack my cancer
cells“.</p>
<p>Though the therapy has been revolutionary for other types of
leukaemia, it is less so for acute myeloid leukaemia, Dr Sankaran
said.</p>
<p>In the last clinical trial, her doctor told Schlossberg that he could
“keep me alive for a year, maybe“.</p>
<p>She also discussed battling cancer while watching her cousin, Health
Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, make massive cuts to research funding,
including for cancers. She and other family members are ardent critics
of Kennedy since his unsuccessful presidential campaign and nomination
for the health role.</p>
<p>“As I spent more and more of my life under the care of doctors,
nurses, and researchers striving to improve the lives of others, I
watched as Bobby cut nearly a half billion dollars for research into
mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,“
Schlossberg wrote.</p>
<p>Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic, announced in August that he was pulling
the funding over claims that “mRNA technology poses more risks than
benefits“ for certain respiratory viruses. He also revoked funding for
hundreds of research grants through the National Institutes of Health
(NIH).</p>
<p>Even though cuts to mRNA funding were only for respiratory viruses,
they have had a chilling effect in the entire mRNA research community,
said Jeff Coller, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins
University focused on RNA therapeutics.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen that researchers are, quite frankly, afraid to put
together proposals for clinical trials that would be using mRNAs. And we
call these cancer vaccines,“ he said.</p>
<p>The NIH was once a global leader in funding for biomedical research,
but that has changed this year, Dr Sankaran said.</p>
<p>“That’s been limiting, because you could just imagine you need to
take more shots on goal to actually have research that will successfully
lead to therapies,“ he said.</p>
<p>Schlossberg’s battle - while having access to the best care as a
member of a prominent American family - highlights the need for more
funding to develop better screening tools and treatments for all
patients, physicians said.</p>
<p>“[Schlossberg] continues to have a poor prognosis with even the best
available tools that we have, and so I think it just really emphasizes
our need to do better for many of our patients,“ Dr Sankaran said.</p>

id="jfks-granddaughter-tatiana-schlossberg-shares-terminal-cancer-diagnosis">JFK’s
granddaughter Tatiana Schlossberg shares terminal cancer diagnosis</h3>
<p>The granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy has announced
her diagnosis with an aggressive form of cancer.</p>
<p>Tatiana Schlossberg said she has been given less than a year to
live.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old shared the news in an essay published in The New
Yorker on Saturday - the 62nd anniversary of her grandfather’s
assassination.</p>
<p>The mother-of-two climate journalist has been an outspoken opponent
of her relative Robert F Kennedy Jr’s position as US health secretary
under President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>In her essay, Schlossberg describes her alarm at watching her cousin
be approved to the post as she was battling her illness.</p>
<p>Schlossberg is the daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and
diplomat Caroline Kennedy. She is the granddaughter of John F. Kennedy,
the 35th president of the United States, and First Lady Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis.</p>
<p>According to Schlossberg’s essay titled A Battle With My Blood, she
was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia after giving birth in May
2024.</p>
<p>She described her previously healthy lifestyle, which included
running, skiing and even once swimming in New York’s Hudson River,
“eerily, to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society“.</p>
<p>Despite treatment, including a bone marrow transplant and
chemotherapy, she said doctors have told her the outcome does not look
good.</p>
<p>“During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could
keep me alive for a year, maybe,“ she writes.</p>
<p>“My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on
the inside of my eyelids, wouldn’t remember me.“</p>
<p>Schlossberg’s son was born in 2022 and her daughter in 2024.</p>
<p>Schlossberg, whose uncle John F Kennedy Jr died in a plane crash at
age 38 and whose grandmother Jacqueline died of cancer when Schlossberg
was a toddler, also describes the pain she fears her death will cause
her mother, who previously served as US ambassador to Australia and
Japan.</p>
<p>“For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and
a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never
make her upset or angry,“ she writes.</p>
<p>“Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family’s life,
and there’s nothing I can do to stop it.“</p>
<p>She also described her upset at watching her cousin, known as RFK Jr
- whose father Robert F Kennedy was also assassinated while running for
president - become Trump’s health secretary.</p>
<p>“I watched from my hospital bed as Bobby, in the face of logic and
common sense, was confirmed for the position, despite never having
worked in medicine, public health, or the government,“ she writes.</p>
<p>“Suddenly, the healthcare system on which I relied felt strained,
shaky.“</p>
<p>Earlier this month, her brother Jack Schlossberg announced that he is
planning to run for Congress in New York.</p>
<p>He shared her essay online on Saturday, with the caption: “Life is
short - let it rip.“</p>
<p>The Kennedy family’s generations-spanning participation in US
politics - along with the personal tragedy which has often touched its
members - has garnered it a prominent reputation in American life.</p>

who grabbed Ariana Grande at premiere banned from Singapore</h3>
<p>An Australian man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed Hollywood
star Ariana Grande has been deported and banned from Singapore.</p>
<p>Johnson Wen, 26, was</p>
<p>Wen pushed past photographers and charged at the actress and singer,
who was attending the Asian premier for Wicked: For Good on 13 November.
Co-star Cynthia Erivo wrestled him away from Grande.</p>
<p>Wen has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events,
including jumping on stage at Katy Perry’s Sydney concert in June this
year.</p>
<p>The incident sparked outrage in Singapore, with many accusing him of
re-traumatising Grande.</p>
<p>The pop star has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress
disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her concert in Manchester in May
2017 killed 22 people and injured hundreds.</p>
<p>During Wen’s trial, the court heard he had attempted to intrude on
the film’s premiere twice, according to Singaporean media.</p>
<p>He then made a second attempt to jump the barricades. Security staff
stopped him and pinned him down.</p>
<p>Wen later posted videos thanking Grande for letting him on the carpet
and said he was “free“.</p>
<p>Police arrested him the next day and charged him with public
nuisance, to which Wen pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>The District Judge Christopher Goh was quoted by Channel News Asia as
saying that Wen was “attention seeking“, adding that he was wrong to
think he would not suffer any consequences.</p>
<p>Grande has not commented on the case.</p>
<p>Erivo spoke about the incident to NBC, saying that she “just wanted
to make sure my friend was safe“.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he didn’t mean us harm, but you never know with those
things, and I wanted to make sure that she was OK. That was my first
instinct,“ she said.</p>

<h3 id="mumbais-glorious-art-deco-legacy-at-100">Mumbai’s glorious Art
Deco legacy at 100</h3>
<p>It was at a landmark architecture exhibition in Paris in 1925 that
the Art Deco aesthetic first exploded on the scene.</p>
<p>In the 100 years since, the glamorous building style - evocative of
neon-lit jazz bars and the golden age of big motion pictures - rapidly
spread around the world.</p>
<p>It moved from the famous pastel hotel facades of Miami’s South Beach
to the sprawling necklace of mansion apartments along Mumbai’s Marine
Drive seafront.</p>
<p>Art Deco’s distinct motifs - typified by geometrical</p>
<p>In a short time, the style transcended architecture to influence the
design sensibility of home interiors, furniture, fonts, jewellery and
some of the world’s most iconic cinema halls - from Radio City Music
Hall in New York City to Regal, Liberty and Eros cinemas in Mumbai.</p>
<p>“It represented hope, optimism and speed, coinciding with the
emergence of the motor car and also concrete as a building material,
which when compared with stone, could be worked with in a tenth of the
time and fifth of the cost,“ Atul Kumar, founder of the Art Deco Mumbai
Trust and curator of a new exhibition celebrating the centenary of Art
Deco in the city, told the BBC.</p>
<p>“It was not elaborate like Victorian Gothic design that preceded it,
and came with a classicism and simplicity that has survived the test of
time,“ he said.</p>
<p>And nowhere has that been more apparent than in Mumbai, which,
according to Mr Kumar, is home to the world’s largest documented
collection of Art Deco buildings. Other estimates put Mumbai in the
second spot behind Miami.</p>
<p>What made Mumbai’s tryst with Art Deco particularly interesting was
how the city embraced its hallmarks in a truly all-encompassing
manner.</p>
<p>Just like Miami, the style emerged in the city at a time of economic
flux and transformation, spurred by its modern, mercantile port-city
energy.</p>
<p>But unlike Miami where it “arrived as a projection of leisure or
spectacle“, in Mumbai the “style resonated across various building
typologies, including schools, cinemas, bungalows, petrol stations and
banks,“ Mr Kumar said.</p>
<p>Art Deco buildings in Mumbai were, and still often are, hidden in
plain sight, with even their occupants often blissfully unaware of their
cultural moorings.</p>
<p>But their all-pervading architectural shadow over the city is perhaps
why Art Deco is “seeped into the larger public imagination, and remains
relevant in Mumbai’s emotional quotient“, Mr Kumar added.</p>
<p>The style was brought to Mumbai at a time when it was under colonial
rule.</p>
<p>It was India’s first bunch of home-grown architects - pivotal figures
like Chimanlal Master, Laxman Vishnu Sathe and Gopalji Mulji Bhuta - who
integrated it into their designs after returning home with degrees from
the Royal Institute of British Architects in London.</p>
<p>“They were suddenly exposed to new European sensibilities and wanted
to bring them back to their country, which was deeply colonised by the
imposition of Victorian buildings,“ Mr Kumar said.</p>
<p>But they adapted Art Deco and vernacularised it, throwing in native
design patterns, drawing inspiration from disparate local elements
including ocean liners docked at Mumbai’s ports and even lattice screens
that are so typical of Mughal architecture.</p>
<p>The British were initially dismissive, calling Art Deco “lesser
architecture“, but were presumably threatened, said Mr Kumar, as it
signalled the dawn of a new age and of new identities that were shaping
India’s public spaces.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before South Mumbai’s skyline would
become a rich confluence of Indo-Saracenic, Gothic and Art Deco
buildings.</p>
<p>Today, Mumbai is yet again a city in rapid flux - its building code
governed by real estate moguls trying to maximise the floor space index,
giving way to utilitarian rather than stylistic considerations.</p>
<p>Dozens of Art Deco buildings have been erased to give way to glass
and steel facades, and hundreds more are under threat.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Mr Kumar has documented more than 1,500
buildings that are truly representative of the style, but only 70-odd of
those are protected.</p>
<p>Authorities are apathetic to their preservation, so his organisation
is engaging directly with people, offering pro-bono repair and
restoration consultancies to prevent them from giving away their
properties to builders for redevelopment.</p>
<p>“The response has been positive as people have seen the value of
their real estate go up after the renovations,“ said Mr Kumar.</p>
<p>Then there are others, like architect and designer Nidhi Tekwani, who
is re-imagining Art Deco objects and hoping to adapt them for a
contemporary context.</p>
<p>For example, Art Deco furniture was often bulky, its light fittings
were meant for high ceilings, and its dressing tables too elaborate for
today’s compact apartments. Ms Tekwani aims to design and launch
products that are sleeker while preserving core Art Deco principles.</p>
<p>“The hope is to translate it to something modern and well-fitting of
our current lifestyle requirements,“ said Ms Tekwani of her efforts to
keep Art Deco a living tradition in a city that’s remaking itself
between one blink and the next.</p>

id="mystery-drones-halt-air-traffic-near-dutch-city-of-eindhoven">Mystery
drones halt air traffic near Dutch city of Eindhoven</h3>
<p>Air traffic above the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven was suspended
for several hours on Saturday after unidentified drones were spotted
near the airport.</p>
<p>Drones were first observed late on Friday over the nearby Volkel air
force base. Weapons were deployed to try to shoot them down but the
devices got away.</p>
<p>After more sightings on Saturday, airspace around the airport was
closed until around 23:00 local time (22:00 GMT).</p>
<p>Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans said authorities had “taken
measures“ without elaborating.</p>
<p>It is the latest in a series of incidents at military installations
and airports in northern Europe in recent months. Russia has denied
accusations it was involved in them.</p>
<p>As well as being used by the Royal Netherlands Air Force, Volkel Air
Base hosts a US Air Force squadron as part of Nato.</p>
<p>Officials said that for security reasons they would provide no
details about how the drones were first spotted on Friday or what action
was taken to try to bring them down.</p>
<p>Drones have been sighted at other Dutch air bases in the past few
weeks, as well as facilities in neighbouring Belgium, Denmark and
Germany.</p>
<p>A lack of evidence pointing to their origins has plagued
investigations into the incidents since they began in September, as in
many cases the drones depart after a while.</p>
<p>Some European officials have attributed the sightings to “hybrid
warfare“ on the part of Russia, as the nations that have been targeted
are all allied to Ukraine.</p>
<p>But the Kremlin has denied it has anything to do with past
incursions.</p>
<p>Defence ministers from 10 EU countries have agreed to create a “drone
wall“ in response to the sightings, while some individual nations have
sought to secure anti-drone defence measures.</p>

id="ukraines-allies-voice-concerns-over-us-plan-to-end-war">Ukraine’s
allies voice concerns over US plan to end war</h3>
<p>Ukraine’s allies from Europe, Canada and Japan have voiced concerns
over a US plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, saying it “will require
additional work“.</p>
<p>In a statement, they said the plan had elements “essential for a just
and lasting peace“, but cited concerns over border changes and
limitations on Ukraine’s forces.</p>
<p>Security officials from the UK, France, Germany, the US and Ukraine
will now meet in Geneva, Switzerland, on Sunday for further talks.</p>
<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier warned Ukraine faced “one of the
most difficult moments in our history“ over pressure from the US to
accept the plan - leaked details of which are seen as favourable to
Moscow.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump has given Ukraine until 27 November to
accept the 28-point plan, while Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said
it could be the “basis“ for a settlement.</p>
<p>Saturday’s joint statement at the G20 summit in South Africa was
signed by the leaders of Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany and Norway. Two top EU officials
were also among the signatories.</p>
<p>The statement said: “We believe therefore that the draft is a basis
which will require additional work. We are ready to engage in order to
ensure that a future peace is sustainable. <strong>We are clear on the
principle that borders must not be changed by force.</strong></p>
<p>“We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed
forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.“</p>
<p>It added: “The implementation of elements relating to the European
Union and relating to Nato would need the consent of EU and Nato members
respectively“.</p>
<p>The widely leaked US peace plan proposes Ukrainian troops withdraw
from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control,
and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring
Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in
2014.</p>
<p>The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine’s southern
Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both
regions are partially occupied by Russia.</p>
<p>The US draft would also limit Ukraine’s military to 600,000
personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring
Poland.</p>
<p>Kyiv would receive “reliable security guarantees“, the plan says,
although no details have been given. The document says “it is expected“
that Russia will not invade its neighbours and Nato will not expand
further.</p>
<p>The plan also suggests Russia will be “reintegrated into the global
economy“, through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to
rejoin the G7 group of the world’s most powerful countries - making it
the G8 again.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump said Zelensky would “have to like“ the US proposals,
adding otherwise Ukraine and Russia would continue fighting.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader addressed the nation with a
stark warning that the country “might face a very difficult choice:
either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner“.</p>
<p>“<strong>Today is one of the most difficult moments in our
history</strong>,“ Zelensky added, pledging to work “constructively“
with the Americans on the plan.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Zelensky announced his head of office Andriy Yermak
would lead Ukraine’s negotiating team for future talks on a peace deal,
including any that may involve Russia.</p>
<p>“Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine’s national interests
and exactly what must be done to prevent Russia from launching a third
invasion, another strike against Ukraine,“ the president said in a video
statement posted on social media.</p>
<p>Kyiv is critically dependent on deliveries of US-made advanced
weaponry, including air defence systems to repel deadly Russian air
assaults, as well as intelligence provided by Washington.</p>
<p>Putin on Friday confirmed Moscow had received the US plan - but said
it had not been discussed with the Kremlin in detail.</p>
<p>He added Moscow was willing to “show flexibility“ - but was also
prepared to fight on.</p>
<p>Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
<p>In recent months, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in
Ukraine’s south-eastern region - despite reported heavy combat
casualties.</p>
<h3 id="jd-vance">JD Vance</h3>
<p>Any Ukraine-Russia peace plan has to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Stop the killing while preserving Ukrainian sovereignty.</p></li>
<li><p>Be acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine.</p></li>
<li><p>Maximize the chances the war doesn’t restart.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Every criticism of the peace framework the administration is working
on either misunderstands the framework or misstates some critical
reality on the ground.</p>
<p>There is a fantasy that if we just give more money,more weapons, or
more sanctions, victory is at hand.Peace won’t be made by failed
diplomats or politicians living in a fantasy land.It might be made by
smart people living in the real world.</p>
