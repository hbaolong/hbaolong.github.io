felt ‘dehumanised’ after Musk’s Grok AI used to digitally remove her
clothes</h4>
<p>A woman has told the BBC she felt “dehumanised and reduced into a
sexual stereotype“ after Elon Musk’s AI Grok was used to digitally
remove her clothing.</p>
<p>The BBC has seen several examples on the social media platform X of
people asking the chatbot to undress women to make them appear in
bikinis without their consent, as well as putting them in sexual
situations.</p>
<p>XAI, the company behind Grok, did not respond to a request for
comment, other than with an automatically-generated reply stating
“legacy media lies“.</p>
<p>Samantha Smith shared a post on X about her image being altered,
which was met with comments from those who had experienced the same -
before others asked Grok to generate more of her.</p>
<p>“Women are not consenting to this,“ she said.</p>
<p>“While it wasn’t me that was in states of undress, it looked like me
and it felt like me and it felt as violating as if someone had actually
posted a nude or a bikini picture of me.“</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesperson said it was legislating to ban
nudification tools, and under a new criminal offence, anyone who
supplied such tech would “face a prison sentence and substantial
fines“.</p>
<p>The regulator Ofcom said tech firms must “assess the risk“ of people
in the UK viewing illegal content on their platforms, but did not
confirm whether it was currently investigating X or Grok in relation to
AI images.</p>
<p>Grok is a free AI assistant - with some paid for premium features -
which responds to X users’ prompts when they tag it in a post.</p>
<p>It is often used to give reaction or more context to other posters’
remarks, but people on X are also able to edit an uploaded image through
its AI image editing feature.</p>
<p>It has been criticised for allowing users to generate photos and
videos with nudity and sexualised content, and it was previously accused
of making a sexually explicit clip of Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>Clare McGlynn, a law professor at Durham University, said X or Grok
“could prevent these forms of abuse if they wanted to“, adding they
“appear to enjoy impunity“.</p>
<p>“The platform has been allowing the creation and distribution of
these images for months without taking any action and we have yet to see
any challenge by regulators,“ she said.</p>
<p>XAI’s own acceptable use policy prohibits “depicting likenesses of
persons in a pornographic manner“.</p>
<p>In a statement to the BBC, Ofcom said it was illegal to “create or
share non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material“ and
confirmed this included sexual deepfakes created with AI.</p>
<p>It said platforms such as X were required to take “appropriate steps“
to “reduce the risk“ of UK users encountering illegal content on their
platforms, and take it down quickly when they become aware of it.</p>
