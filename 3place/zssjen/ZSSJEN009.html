<p>The BMA said they would work with NHS bosses to ensure safety in

<p>At Prime Minister’s Questions, Starmer said his message to resident
doctors was: “Don’t abandon patients, work with us to improve to
conditions and rebuild the NHS.“</p>

“have the baubles“ to ban doctors’ strikes, and that he had lost control

<p>“What we’re asking for is to stop these real-term pay cuts that the
government is recommending for doctors,“ he said.</p>
<p>Asked about recent polling that suggests public support for the
strikes is declining, he said: “I do care what my patients think but I
didn’t sign up to give that care in a corridor.“</p>
<p>This is the 14th walkout by resident doctors in a long-running pay
dispute.</p>
<p>The strike went ahead after last-minute talks between the government
and union broke down without agreement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The meeting was described as “constructive“ by the government, but
not enough progress had been made to call off the strike.</p>
<p>Resident doctors represent nearly half of the doctors working in the
NHS. They are walking out of both emergency and non-urgent care with
senior doctors drafted in to provide cover.</p>
<p>Around 50 medics have been protesting outside St Thomas’ Hospital in
London, and more at hospitals around the country including Leeds and
Newcastle.</p>
<p>Dr Krunthika Ramamurthi, who was trained as a doctor in India and has
been working in the UK for five years, said she has not been able to
obtain a specialty training post, which doctors can apply for after the
first two years of training.</p>
<p>Instead, she has been forced to work as a locum and work short-term
posts that do not count towards her training.</p>
<p>“It is really difficult. I am not progressing in my career – it is
clear there is a shortage of jobs. I don’t want to strike, but the
government is not addressing our concerns – pay is still below the 2008
levels,“ she said.</p>
<p>“If the NHS is crumbling because of the flu cases that tells you
everything really – the NHS needs to be better resourced.“</p>
<p>In the two most recent strikes – in July and November – NHS England
said it was able to keep the majority of non-urgent operations and
treatments, such as hip and knee replacements, going.</p>
<p>Speaking in parliament on Wednesday morning, Health Secretary Wes
Streeting said he “deeply regretted“ the impact the strike would have on
patients in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
<p>He said the situation in some hospitals was already “dicey“ and he
was concerned about the effect on other medical staff who would be
“knackered as a result“ of industrial action.</p>
<p>He said there was no sign of a breakthrough after five hours of talks
with BMA representatives on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I think on jobs, [we are] broadly in agreement, [but] on pay [we
are] too far apart,“ he said.</p>
<p>“These strikes will come at a cost of £250m and impact on operational
pressures, on patients and on the whole NHS workforce, and I deeply
regret we are in this situation.“</p>
<p>Concern has been expressed that hospitals may struggle to discharge
patients in time for Christmas as the doctors who are working
concentrate on providing strike cover.</p>
<p>Medical director Prof Meghana Pandit said the strikes came “at an
immensely challenging time for the NHS“, with record numbers of patients
in hospital with flu for this time of year.</p>
<p>She said more patients were likely to feel the impact of this round
of strikes than the previous two, adding that staff who are covering for
those striking would not get a Christmas break with their families.</p>
<p>NHS England said GP practices will continue to be open and urgent and
emergency care services will be available for those who need them.</p>
<p>But even then there is likely to be some disruption.</p>
<p>NHS England said the public should use</p>
<p>Patients who need emergency medical care should continue to use 999
or come forward to AandandandandE as normal, it added.</p>
<p>The strike is going ahead despite a new offer from the government
being made last week, which included increasing the number of speciality
training posts and covering out-of-pocket expenses like exam fees.</p>
<p>Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents
hospital and ambulance services, said the strikes are “like having the
worst possible Groundhog Day“.</p>
<p>“But unlike the film this is real, so thousands of patients are going
to have their operations and procedures postponed or cancelled,“ he told
BBC Breakfast.</p>
<p>He added that the “increasingly acrimonious dispute“ feels like it’s
as “far away from being resolved as it ever has been“.</p>
<p>However, he added that patients will still be safe in hospital and
that people should attend appointments unless informed otherwise.</p>
<p>On Monday the BMA announced its members had voted to continue with
the strike – effectively rejecting the offer in the process – after the
union agreed to hold an online poll of members.</p>
<p>Streeting has maintained he will not discuss pay as doctors have
received pay rises totalling nearly 30% over the past three years.</p>
<p>The BMA argues that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors’ pay is
still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into
account.</p>
<p>But it said it was committed to ensuring patient safety.</p>
<p>“We will be in close contact with NHS England throughout the strikes
to address safety concerns if they arise,“ the union added.</p>
<p>Resident doctors in Wales have accepted a new contract which promises
a 4% additional investment in their workforce.</p>
<p>In Scotland, BMA resident doctor members are waiting for the results
of their strike ballot later this week, after claiming government
ministers went back on an agreement over pay.</p>

<p>So far Scotland is the only part of the UK to have avoided strikes by
NHS workers.</p>
