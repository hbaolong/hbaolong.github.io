says US plan to end Ukraine war not ‘final offer’ for Kyiv</h4>
<p>President Donald Trump has said a US plan to end the Russia-Ukraine
war is not his “final offer“ for Kyiv, after Ukrainian allies voiced
concerns over proposals.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, leaders from Europe, Canada and Japan said the
plan had elements “essential for a just and lasting peace“, but would
“require additional work“, citing concerns over border changes and caps
on Ukraine’s army.</p>
<p>On Sunday, security officials from Britain, France, Germany, the US
and Ukraine will meet in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier warned Ukraine faced “one of the
most difficult moments in our history“ over US pressure to accept the
plan seen as favourable to Moscow.</p>
<p>Trump has given Ukraine until 27 November to accept the 28-point
plan, while Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said it could be the
“basis“ for a settlement.</p>
<p>When asked on Saturday whether the current draft plan was his final
offer for Ukraine, Trump told reporters at the White House: “No, not my
final offer.“</p>
<p>“One way or another we have to get it [the war] ended, so we’re
working on it,“ he added.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff
will be among those taking part in talks in Geneva on Sunday. National
Security Adviser Jonathan Powell will attend on the UK’s behalf.</p>
<p>Saturday’s joint statement at the G20 summit in South Africa was
signed by the leaders of Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany and Norway. Two top EU officials
were also among the signatories.</p>
<p>The statement said: “We believe therefore that the draft is a basis
which will require additional work. We are ready to engage in order to
ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle
that borders must not be changed by force.</p>
<p>“We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed
forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.“</p>
<p>It added: “The implementation of elements relating to the European
Union and relating to Nato would need the consent of EU and Nato members
respectively“.</p>
<p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is at the G20 summit in
Johannesburg, spoke to Zelensky on the phone on Saturday, followed by a
call with Trump.</p>
<p>On the Trump call, a Downing Street spokesman said Sir Keir “relayed
the discussions that have been taking place between Coalition of the
Willing partners [Ukraine’s allies] in attendance at the G20 summit
today“.</p>
<p>They added: “The leaders agreed their teams would work together on
the 28-point US peace proposal in Geneva tomorrow. They agreed to speak
again tomorrow.“</p>
<p>Sir Keir earlier said he was concerned about proposed caps on
Ukraine’s military in the US plan, saying “it’s fundamental that Ukraine
has to be able to defend itself if there’s a ceasefire“.</p>
<p>The widely leaked US peace plan proposes Ukrainian troops withdraw
from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control,
and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring
Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in
2014.</p>
<p>The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine’s southern
Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both
regions are partially occupied by Russia.</p>
<p>The US draft would also limit Ukraine’s military to 600,000
personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring
Poland.</p>
<p>Kyiv would receive “reliable security guarantees“, the plan says,
although no details have been given. The document says “it is expected“
that Russia will not invade its neighbours and Nato will not expand
further.</p>
<p>The plan also suggests Russia will be “reintegrated into the global
economy“, through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to
rejoin the G7 group of the world’s most powerful countries - making it
the G8 again.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump said Zelensky would “have to like“ the US proposals,
adding otherwise Ukraine and Russia would continue fighting.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader addressed the nation with a
stark warning that the country “might face a very difficult choice:
either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner“.</p>
<p>“Today is one of the most difficult moments in our history,“ Zelensky
added, pledging to work “constructively“ with the Americans on the
plan.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Zelensky announced that his head of office Andriy Yermak
would lead Ukraine’s negotiating team for future talks on a peace deal,
including any that may involve Russia.</p>
<p>“Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine’s national interests
and exactly what must be done to prevent Russia from launching a third
invasion, another strike against Ukraine,“ the president said in a video
statement posted on social media.</p>
<p>Kyiv is critically dependent on deliveries of US-made advanced
weaponry, including air defence systems to repel deadly Russian air
assaults, as well as intelligence provided by Washington.</p>
<p>Putin on Friday confirmed Moscow had received the US plan - but said
it had not been discussed with the Kremlin in detail.</p>
<p>He added Moscow was willing to “show flexibility“ - but was also
prepared to fight on.</p>
<p>Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
<p>In recent months, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in
Ukraine’s south-eastern region - despite reported heavy combat
casualties.</p>
