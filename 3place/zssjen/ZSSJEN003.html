climate talks fail to secure new fossil fuel promises</h4>
<p>Georgina Rannard</p>
<p>Climate and science correspondent, Belém, Brazil</p>
<p>Following bitter rows, the UN climate summit COP30 in Belém, Brazil
has ended with a deal that contains no direct reference to the fossil
fuels that are heating up the planet.</p>
<p>It is a frustrating end for more than 80 countries including the UK
and EU that wanted the meeting to commit the world to stop using using
oil, coal and gas at a faster pace.</p>
<p>But oil-producing nations held the line that they should be allowed
to use their fossil fuel resources to grow their economies.</p>
<p>The meeting takes place as the UN says it fears global efforts to
limit global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels have
failed.</p>
<p>A representative for Colombia furiously criticised the COP presidency
for not allowing countries to object to the deal in the final meeting on
Saturday, known as a plenary.</p>
<p>“Colombia believes that we have sufficient scientific evidence saying
that more than 75% of the global greenhouse gas emissions come from
fossil fuels,“ Daniela Durán González, Colombian Climate Delegate, told
BBC News.</p>
<p>“So we do believe it’s time that the Convention on Climate Change
starts talking about that reality,“ she added.</p>
<p>The final deal, called the Mutirão, calls on countries to
“voluntarily“ accelerate their action to reduce their use of fossil
fuels.</p>
<p>For the first time, the US did not send a delegation after President
Donald Trump said the country will leave the landmark Paris treaty that
committed countries to act on climate change in 2015. He has branded
climate change “a con“.</p>
<p>Veteran negotiator and former Germany climate envoy Jennifer Morgan
told the BBC that the US absence was a “hole“ in the negotiations. Often
the US has supported blocs like the EU and UK.</p>
<p>“In a 12-hour negotiation overnight, when you have oil-producing
countries pushing back hard, to not have someone counteracting on that,
it certainly was hard,“ she said</p>
<p>But for many countries, the fact that the talks did not collapse or
roll back on past climate agreements is a relief.</p>
<p>Antigua and Barbuda Climate Ambassador Ruleta Thomas commented: “We
are happy that there is a process that continues to function […] where
every country can be heard.“</p>
<p>In the final meeting, a representative for Saudi Arabia said: “Each
state must be allowed to build its own path, based on its respective
circumstances and economies.“</p>
<p>Like many other leading oil-producing nations, the country has argued
it should be allowed to exploit its fossil fuel reserves as others have
done in the past.</p>
<p>The two weeks of talks were at times chaotic. Toilets ran out of
water, torrential thunderstorms flooded the venue, and delegates
struggled to cope in hot, humid rooms.</p>
<p>The COP’s around 50,000 registered delegates were evacuated twice. A
group of about 150 protestors broke into the venue, breaching security
lines, and carrying placards reading “our forests are not for sale“.</p>
<p>On Thursday a large fire broke out, scorching a hole into the roof
and forcing participants to rush outside.</p>
<p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva chose the city of Belém
to put the world’s attention on the Amazon rainforest and to bring a
rush of finance to the city.</p>
<p>Despite its desire for a more ambitious fossil fuel agreement, Brazil
was criticised for its own plans to drill for oil at the mouth of the
Amazon.</p>
<p>Its offshore oil and gas production is on course to increase until
the early 2030s, according to analysis shared with the BBC by campaign
group Global Witness.</p>
<p>Countries at the talks have competing interests, depending on their
national circumstances and how exposed they are to the effects of
climate change. Some countries were happy about the outcomes.</p>
<p>India praised the deal, calling it “meaningful“. A group representing
the interests of 39 small island and low-lying coastal states on
Saturday called it “imperfect“ but still a step towards “progress“.</p>
<p>Poorer nations have come away with a promise for more climate finance
to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>“It has moved the needle. There is a clearer recognition that those
with historic responsibility [countries that emitted more planet-warming
gases in the past] have specific duties on climate finance,“ said Sierra
Leone Minister of The Environment and Climate Change Jiwoh Abdulai.</p>
<p>But it’s a sour end for more than 80 countries, who negotiated
through the night to keep stronger fossil fuel language in the deal.</p>
<p>UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband
insisted the meeting is a “step forward“.</p>
<p>“I would have preferred a more ambitious agreement,“ he said.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to hide the fact that we would have preferred to
have more, to have more ambition on everything,“ EU climate commissioner
Wopke Hoekstra told journalists.</p>
<p>With lush trees, bird cries and intense humidity, it was hard to
escape the Amazonian backdrop of the talks.</p>
<p>Brazil launched the talks with a new fund called Tropical Forests
Forever Facility that would pay countries to protect tropical forests.
By the end of the meeting, it raised at least .5bn from governments,
although the UK has not yet contributed.</p>
<p>Over 90 countries supported a call for a global deforestation action
plan, or “roadmap“.</p>
