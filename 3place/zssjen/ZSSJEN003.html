Africa gang violence: Firoz Cachalia says police not able to defeat
gangsters</h4>
<p>South Africa’s Police Minister Firoz Cachalia has said that the
security forces are not yet able to defeat deadly criminal gangs, in a
stark admission that underscores the scale of the country’s crime
crisis.</p>
<p>Gang violence, alongside robberies, accounts for many murders in
South Africa, which has one of the world’s highest homicide rates.</p>
<p>Cachalia said gang violence had become increasingly complex,
especially in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces, requiring new
strategies beyond traditional policing.</p>
<p>“I do not believe that we are currently in a position to defeat these
gangs,“ the minister told journalists on Wednesday.</p>
<p>South Africa, the continent’s most industrialised nation, has long
struggled with entrenched organised crime.</p>
<p>Many people in South Africa own licensed firearms for personal
protection, but there are many more illegal guns in circulation.</p>
<p>Police data shows that an average of 63 people were killed each day
between April and September last year.</p>
<p>Speaking after his visit to crime-infested Nelson Mandela Bay in
Eastern Cape, Cachalia said criminal gangs were on a “killing spree“ in
the two provinces.</p>
<p>“We had a discussion about the problem of organised crime in the
Eastern Cape, including extortion rackets, gang violence and related
issues,“ said the minister.</p>
<p>“I indicated that this is a grave problem throughout the country,
that these cartels wield significant wealth and power, and that this is
deeply concerning,“ he added.</p>
<p>Despite the creation of an anti-gang unit in 2019, Cachalia said
gangsters seemed to be winning the war.</p>
<p>“Establishing gang units from time to time is an ad hoc response to a
growing problem. I really don’t think that we should be approaching this
matter in a point-scoring way.“</p>
<p>He said South African police were doing their best to fight the
violence “but the problem is a growing one. That is my view“.</p>
<p>His visit comes months after Nelson Mandela Bay was hit by a wave of
killings.</p>
<p>A deadly spike in violence hit the area in the latter half of last
year, leaving 118 people dead between August and December, a local
prevention group said.</p>
<p>The violence has continued into the new year, with around 40 people
killed across the region in January, local media reported.</p>
<p>There are about three million legally held firearms in South Africa,
but there are at least the same number of unlicensed weapons in
circulation in the country, which has a population of 63 million,
according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African
Gunowners’ Association.</p>
<p>Last month, 11 people were killed in a mass shooting linked to
illegal mining turf wars near Johannesburg.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred just two weeks after another attack at the
Saulsville Hostel in the capital Pretoria, where 11 people, including a
three-year-old child, were killed.</p>
<p>In another incident last May, gunmen killed eight customers at a
tavern in the south-eastern city of Durban.</p>
<p>President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised stronger law enforcement
action and increased police deployment to tackle the gang violence in
the country.</p>
