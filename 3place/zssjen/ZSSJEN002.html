Energy may be changing and with it the fate of the Universe</h4>
<p>There is growing controversy over recent evidence suggesting that a
mysterious force known as dark energy might be changing in a way that
challenges our current understanding of time and space.</p>
<p>An analysis by a South Korean team has hinted that, rather than the
Universe continuing to expand, galaxies could be pulled back together by
gravity, ending in what astronomers call a “Big Crunch“.</p>
<p>The scientists involved believe that they may be on the verge of one
of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation.</p>
<p>Other astronomers have questioned these findings, but these critics
have not been able to completely dismiss the South Korean team’s
assertions.</p>
<p>Astronomers previously thought the Universe’s expansion, which began
with the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, should gradually slow
due to gravity.</p>
<p>Then evidence for dark energy was discovered in 1998 as a force
accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Studies of very bright
exploding stars called supernovas showed that rather than slowing down,
distant galaxies were actually accelerating away from each other.</p>
<p>Some theories suggested that this ever‑accelerating Universe could
first spread the stars so far apart that almost nothing would be visible
in the night sky and, more shockingly, might eventually tear even atoms
themselves apart in a “Big Rip“.</p>
<p>The controversy began in March with unexpected results from an
instrument on a telescope in the Arizona desert called the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (Desi).</p>
<p>Desi was built to discover more about dark energy. It tracked the
acceleration of millions of galaxies in exquisite detail, but
astronomers were not expecting the results it came up with.</p>
<p>The data hinted that acceleration of the galaxies had changed over
time, something not in line with the standard picture, according to Prof
Ofer Lahav of University College London, who is involved with the Desi
project.</p>
<p>“Now with this changing dark energy going up and then down, again, we
need a new mechanism. And this could be a shake up for the whole of
physics,“ he says.</p>
<p>Then in November the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) published
research from a South Korean team that seems to back the view that the
weirdness of dark energy is weirder still.</p>
<p>Prof Young Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team went
back to the kind of supernova data that first revealed dark energy 27
years ago. Instead of treating these stellar explosions as having one
standard brightness, they adjusted for the ages of the galaxies they
came from and worked out how bright the supernovas really were.</p>
<p>This adjustment showed that not only had dark energy changed over
time, but, shockingly, that the acceleration was slowing down.</p>
<p>“The fate of the Universe will change,“ Prof Lee tells BBC News
starkly.</p>
<p>“If dark energy is not constant and it’s getting weakened, this will
change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology.“</p>
<p>If, as Prof Lee’s results suggest, the force that is pushing galaxies
away from each other - dark energy - is weakening, then one possibility
is that it becomes so weak that gravity begins to pull the galaxies back
together.</p>
<p>“Rather than ending with a Big Rip, a Big Crunch is now a
possibility.</p>
<p>“Which outcome wins, depends on the true nature of dark energy, for
which we still do not know the answer,“ says Prof Lee.</p>
<p>Prof Lee’s work has been checked by fellow experts and published in a
respected journal of the RAS. But his claims have not gone down at all
well with many senior astronomers working in the field, such as Prof
George Efstathiou of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge
University.</p>
<p>“I think that this is just reflecting the messy details of
supernovas,“ he says. “The correlation with age is not very tight, so I
think it is dangerous to apply a ‘correction’. It looks weak to me.“</p>
<p>The mainstream view is that the Universe is still accelerating with
almost unchanging dark energy.</p>
<p>But Prof Lee pushes back strongly on such criticisms.</p>
<p>“Our data is based on 300 galaxies. The statistical significance is
roughly one-in-a-trillion chance of being a fluke. So, I strongly feel
that already our research is very, very significant.“</p>
<p>Since the South Korean results, two teams have reassessed the
brightness of some of the supernovas. They looked at an earlier study
that fed into the Desi results from March which began the whole hoo-hah.
They did so to double-check the March results because the claim that
dark energy was changing was so controversial.</p>
<p>Both teams have pulled back slightly from the original hints, but the
hints have not gone away, even after extensive scrutiny.</p>
<p>Consequently there will continue to be passionate, sometimes
contentious, debate over whether the cosmos is gently whispering to us
about its true nature, or whether astronomers are chasing celestial
ghosts.</p>
<p>Hundreds of scientific papers have been published on the subject and
astronomers are split on what they think is the best explanation. This
is no bad thing, according to Prof Robert Massey, who is RAS’s Deputy
Director.</p>
<p>“Who doesn’t want to understand how the universe is going to end and
how it began?“ he says. “Human beings have always been interested in
that, whether you take it from a religious perspective or a scientific
one.</p>
<p>“Being able to think, okay, this is how things will end in many, many
billions of years, wouldn’t that be extraordinary?“</p>
