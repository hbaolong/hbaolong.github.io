are sperm donors having hundreds of children?</h4>
<ul>
<li>sperm,英 [spɜːm] 美 [spɜːrm] n. 精子；精液；鲸蜡油</li>
</ul>
<p>Some men are having vast numbers of children through sperm donation.
This week the</p>
<p>One of the most striking aspects of the investigation was that the
man’s sperm was sent to 14 countries and produced at least 197 children.
The revelation was a rare insight into the scale of the sperm donor
industry.</p>
<ul>
<li>revelation,英 [ˌrevəˈleɪʃ(ə)n] 美 [ˌrevəˈleɪʃ(ə)n]

</ul>
<p>Sperm donation allows women to become mothers when it might not
otherwise be possible - if their partner is infertile, they’re in a
same-sex relationship, or parenting solo.</p>
<ul>
<li>infertile,英 [ɪnˈfɜːtaɪl] 美 [ɪnˈfɜːrt(ə)l] adj.

<p>Filling that need has become big business. It is estimated the market

</ul>
<p>So why are some sperm donors fathering so many children, what made
Danish or so-called “Viking sperm“ so popular, and does the industry
need to be reined in?</p>

</ul>
<p>If you’re a man reading this, we are sorry to break it to you, but
the quality of your sperm probably isn’t good enough to become a donor -
fewer than five in 100 volunteers actually make the grade.</p>
<p>First, you have to produce enough sperm in a sample - that’s your</p>
<p>Sperm is also checked to ensure it can survive being frozen and
stored at a sperm bank.</p>
<p>You could be perfectly fertile, have six children, and still not be
suitable.</p>
<ul>
<li>fertile,英 [ˈfɜːtaɪl] 美 [ˈfɜːrtl] adj.
肥沃的，富饶的；可繁殖的，能结果的；能产生好结果的，促进的；点子多的，想象力丰富的；（核材料）能产生裂变物质的，增殖性的</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules vary across the world, but in the UK you also have to be
relatively young - aged 18-45; be free of infections like HIV and
gonorrhoea, and not be a carrier of mutations that can cause genetic
conditions like cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy and sickle cell
disease.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>infection,英 [ɪnˈfekʃ(ə)n] 美 [ɪnˈfekʃ(ə)n]

</ul>
<p>Overall, it means the pool of people that finally become sperm donors
is small. In the UK, half the sperm ends up being imported.</p>
<p>But biology means a small number of donors can make vast numbers of
children. It takes just one sperm to fertilise an egg, but there are
tens of millions of sperm in each ejaculation.</p>

</ul>
<p>Men will come to the clinic once or twice a week while they’re
donating, which can be for months at a time.</p>

</ul>
<p>Sarah Norcross, the director of the Progress Educational Trust
charity which works on fertility and genomics, said the donor sperm
shortage made it “a precious commodity“ and “sperm banks and fertility
clinics are maximising the use of available donors to meet demand“.</p>
<p>From this small pool of donors, some men’s sperm is just more popular
than others.</p>
<p>Donors are not chosen at random. It’s a similar process to the savage
reality of dating apps, when some men get way more matches than
others.</p>
<p>Depending on the sperm bank, you can browse photos, listen to their
voice, find out what job they do - engineer or artist? - and check out
their height, weight and more.</p>
<p>“You know if they’re called Sven and they’ve got blonde hair, and
they’re 6 ft 4 (1.93m) and they’re an athlete, and they play the fiddle
and speak seven languages - you know that’s far more attractive than a
donor that looks like me,“ says male fertility expert Prof Allan Pacey,
pictured, who used to run a sperm bank in Sheffield.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, people are swiping left and swiping right when it comes
to donor matching.“</p>
<p>Denmark is home to some of the world’s biggest sperm banks, and has
gained a reputation for producing “Viking babies“.</p>
<p>Ole Schou, the 71-year-old founder of the Cryos International sperm
bank where a single 0.5ml vial of sperm costs from €100 (£88) to more
than €1000 (£880), says the culture around sperm donation in Denmark is
very different to other countries.</p>
<p>“The population is like one big family,“ he says, “there is less
taboo about these issues, and we are an altruistic population, many
sperm donors also donate blood.“</p>
<p>And that, Schou says, has allowed the country to become “one of the
few exporters of sperm“.</p>
<p>But he argues Danish sperm is also popular due to genetics. He told
the BBC the Danish “blue-eyed and blonde-haired genes“ are recessive
traits, which means they need to come from both parents in order to
appear in a child.</p>
<p>As a result, the mother’s traits, such as dark hair, “might be
dominant in the resulting child“, Schou explains.</p>
<p>He says demand for donor sperm is coming mainly from “single,
highly-educated, women in their 30s“. They now make up 60% of
requests.</p>
<p>One aspect of</p>
<p>Nations have their own rules on how many times one man’s sperm can be
used. Sometimes it is linked to a total number of children, others limit
it to a certain number of mothers (so each family can have as many
related children as they want).</p>
<p>The original argument around those limits was to avoid half-siblings
- who didn’t know they were related - meeting each other, forming
relationships and having children.</p>
<p>But there’s nothing to stop the same donor’s sperm being used in
Italy and Spain and then the Netherlands and Belgium, as long as the
rules are being followed in each country.</p>
<p>This creates circumstances where a sperm donor can legally father
large numbers of children. Although the man is often in the dark about
that fact.</p>
<p>“Many recipients, and also donors, are unaware that a single donor’s
sperm can be lawfully used in many different countries - this fact
should be better explained,“ says Sarah Norcross, who argues it would be
“sensible“ to bring down the number of children one donor can have.</p>
<p>In response to the investigation into the sperm donor who passed on a
gene that led to cancer in some of the 197 children he fathered,
officials in Belgium have called on the European Commission to establish
a Europe-wide sperm donor register to monitor sperm travelling across
borders.</p>
<p>Deputy prime minister Frank Vandenbroucke said the industry was like
the “Wild West“ and “the initial mission of offering people the
possibility of a family has given way to a veritable fertility
business“.</p>
<p>The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology has also
proposed a limit of 50 families per donor across the EU. That system
would still allow one donor’s sperm to make more than 100 children if
the families wanted two or more babies each.</p>
<p>Concerns have been raised about the impact on the children conceived
through sperm donation. Some will be happy, others can be profoundly
distressed by the double discovery of being made with donor sperm and
being one of hundreds of half-siblings.</p>
<p>The same is true of donors, who often have no idea their sperm is
being so widely distributed.</p>
<p>These risks are amplified by readily available DNA ancestry tests and
social media where people can search for their children, siblings or the
donor. In the UK, there is no longer anonymity for sperm donors and
there is an official process through which children learn the identity
of their biological father.</p>
<p>Mr Schou at Cryos argues more restrictions on sperm donation would
just lead families to “turn to the private, totally unregulated,
market“.</p>
<p>Dr John Appleby, a medical ethicist at Lancaster University, said the
implications of using sperm so widely was a “vast“ ethical
minefield.</p>
<p>He said there are issues around identity, privacy, consent, dignity
and more - making it a “balancing act“ between competing needs.</p>
<p>Dr Appleby said the fertility industry had a “responsibility to get a
handle on the number of times a donor is used“, but agreeing global
regulations would be undeniably “very difficult“.</p>
<p>He added that a global sperm donor register, which has been
suggested, came with its own “ethical and legal challenges“.</p>
