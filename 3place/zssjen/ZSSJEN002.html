and US negotiators to meet in Florida after Moscow talks, White House
says</h4>
<p>US special envoy Steve Witkoff will meet the head of Ukraine’s
national security council, Rustem Umerov, for talks in Miami on
Thursday, the White House has confirmed.</p>
<p>Witkoff spent almost five hours with Russian President Vladimir Putin
in Moscow on Tuesday in negotiations which the Kremlin said produced “no
compromise“ on ending the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump said the talks were “reasonably good“, but
it was too soon to say what would happen as “it does take two to
tango.“</p>
<p>Putin later said reaching a consensus would not be an “easy task“,
reportedly highlighting Moscow’s repeated demand that Ukrainian troops
withdraw from the Donbas region - an area occupied by Russian
forces.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Russian state media reported Putin as saying: “It all
comes down to this. Either we liberate these territories by force of
arms or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories and stop fighting
there.“</p>
<p>State media said Putin’s comments were made during an interview with
news outlet India Today, which came</p>
<p>Wednesday’s talks in Moscow were also attended by Trump’s son-in-law
Jared Kushner.</p>
<p>When asked by a reporter on Wednesday if Witkoff and Kushner believed
Putin wanted an end to the war, Trump said Putin “would like to end the
war. That was their impression.“</p>
<p>But Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhia accused Putin of
“wasting the world’s time“, while Ukraine’s ambassador to the US said
they do not “need to wait for promises from Russia“.</p>
<p>There was “not too much progress“ at this stage of the talks,
ambassador Olga Stefanishyna said, but that they were ongoing.</p>
<p>“It is clear on both sides - in Ukraine and the United States - that
Ukraine is committed to the result. Ukraine has invested a lot in the
commitment to have a just and lasting peace in our country,“ she
explained.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said
“the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the
war“, but negotiations must be “backed by pressure on Russia“.</p>
<p>The US-Russia talks at the Kremlin followed days of US meetings with
Ukrainian and European leaders, after concerns had been expressed that
the draft of a peace deal was too slanted towards Russia’s demands.</p>
<p>“Some of the US proposals look more or less acceptable, though they
need to be discussed further“, Putin’s foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov
said, while adding that others had been openly criticised by Russia’s
leader.</p>
<p>Although Ushakov did not elaborate further, at least two major points
of contention remain between Moscow and Kyiv - the fate of Ukrainian
territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron - who is visiting Beijing
- has urged China’s president Xi Jinping to play a part in securing a
ceasefire in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Kyiv and its European partners believe that, even in the event of a
peace deal, the most effective way to deter Russia from attacking again
in the future would be to grant Ukraine membership of Nato.</p>
<p>Russia is vehemently opposed to such a proposal, and Trump too has
repeatedly signalled he has no intention of letting Kyiv into the
alliance.</p>
<p>The prospect of Ukraine joining Nato was a “key question“ that was
tackled in Moscow, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ushakov, a senior foreign policy adviser to Putin, implied that the
Russian negotiating position had been strengthened thanks to recent
successes on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Russian soldiers had “helped make the assessments of our foreign
partners regarding the paths to a peace settlement more appropriate,“ he
said.</p>
<p>Ahead of the US visit to the Kremlin, Putin was filmed in army
fatigues at a Russian command post, being briefed by commanders claiming
the conquest of the key strategic city of Pokrovsk, in eastern Ukraine,
as well as other nearby settlements.</p>
<p>Fighting in Pokrovsk is continuing and Russian forces do not control
the whole city, but Russian officials clearly believe their message of
military gains has been heard by the US.</p>
<p>Russian forces have made some incremental advances in the east and
appear to have stepped up their campaign in recent weeks. They seized
about 701 sq km (270 sq miles) of Ukrainian territory in November,
according to AFP analysis of data from the US-based Institute for the
Study of War (ISW), and they now control 19.3% of Ukrainian
territory.</p>
<p>The Kremlin on Wednesday said Putin was ready to keep meeting with
the Americans “as many times as needed“.</p>
<p>But as Russian-American relations appear to grow more cordial, the
gulf between Moscow and Europe widens.</p>
<p>Putin has accused Europe of sabotaging Russia’s relations with the
US, of putting forward demands Moscow could not accept and of blocking
the peace process.</p>
<p>Shortly before meeting Witkoff and Kushner, Putin told a forum in
Moscow that while he did not want conflict with Europe, he was “ready
for war“.</p>
<p>UK government officials rejected Putin’s message as “yet more Kremlin
claptrap from a president who isn’t serious about peace“.</p>
<p>Nato foreign ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday and
Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that it was positive that peace talks
were taking place but Ukraine had to be put in “the strongest position
to keep the fight going“.</p>
<p>EU member states have reached a deal with members of the European
Parliament to make Europe fully independent of Russian gas before the
end of 2027.</p>
<p>The European Commission is also proposing to raise €90bn for Ukraine
to fund its military and basic services while Russia’s war continues,
which would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s financing needs for the next
two years.</p>
<p>The plan would either require Belgium to agree to a “reparations
loan“ using frozen Russian assets held in a financial institution in
Brussels, or the money would be funded by international borrowing.</p>
<p>Belgium has resisted the plan to use frozen assets held on its
territory, over concerns about legal repercussions from Moscow. The
European Central Bank (ECB) has also opposed the idea, saying it would
not act as a backstop for a reparations loan.</p>
<p>The proposed loan is smaller than the planned €140bn loan initially
planned.</p>
