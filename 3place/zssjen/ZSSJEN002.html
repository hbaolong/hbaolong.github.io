<h4 id="american-strategy">American Strategy</h4>
<p>I. Introduction – What Is American Strategy?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How American “Strategy” Went Astray</li>
</ol>
<p>To ensure that America remains the world’s strongest, richest, most
powerful, and most successful country for decades to come, our country
needs a coherent, focused strategy for how we interact with the world.
And to get that right, all Americans need to know what, exactly, it is
we are trying to do and why.</p>
<p>A “strategy” is a concrete, realistic plan that explains the
essential connection between ends and means: it begins from an accurate
assessment of what is desired and what tools are available, or can
realistically be created, to achieve the desired outcomes.</p>
<p>A strategy must evaluate, sort, and prioritize. Not every country,
region, issue, or cause—however worthy—can be the focus of American
strategy. The purpose of foreign policy is the protection of core
national interests; that is the sole focus of this strategy.</p>
<p>American strategies since the end of the Cold War have fallen
short—they have been laundry lists of wishes or desired end states; have
not clearly defined what we want but instead stated vague platitudes;
and have often misjudged what we should want.</p>
<p>After the end of the Cold War, American foreign policy elites
convinced themselves that permanent American domination of the entire
world was in the best interests of our country. Yet the affairs of other
countries are our concern only if their activities directly threaten our
interests.</p>
<p>Our elites badly miscalculated America’s willingness to shoulder
forever global burdens to which the American people saw no connection to
the national interest. They overestimated America’s ability to fund,
simultaneously, a massive welfare- regulatory-administrative state
alongside a massive military, diplomatic, intelligence, and foreign aid
complex. They placed hugely misguided and destructive bets on globalism
and so-called “free trade” that hollowed out the very middle class and
industrial base on which American economic and military preeminence
depend. They allowed allies and partners to offload the cost of their
defense onto the American people, and sometimes to suck us into
conflicts and controversies central to their interests but peripheral or
irrelevant to our own. And they lashed American policy to a network of
international institutions, some of which are driven by outright
anti-Americanism and many by a transnationalism that explicitly seeks to
dissolve individual state sovereignty. In sum, not only did our elites
pursue a fundamentally undesirable and impossible goal, in doing so they
undermined the very means necessary to achieve that goal: the character
of our nation upon which its power, wealth, and decency were built.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>President Trump’s Necessary, Welcome Correction</li>
</ol>
<p>None of this was inevitable. President Trump’s first administration
proved that with the right leadership making the right choices, all of
the above could—and should—have been avoided, and much else achieved. He
and his team successfully marshaled America’s great strengths to correct
course and begin ushering in a new golden age for our country. To
continue the United States on that path is the overarching purpose of
President Trump’s second administration, and of this document.</p>
<p>The questions before us now are: 1) What should the United States
want? 2) What are our available means to get it? and 3) How can we
connect ends and means into a viable National Security Strategy?</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>What Should the United States Want?</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>What Do We Want Overall?</li>
</ol>
<p>First and foremost, we want the continued survival and safety of the
United States as an independent, sovereign republic whose government
secures the God-given natural rights of its citizens and prioritizes
their well-being and interests.</p>
<p>We want to protect this country, its people, its territory, its
economy, and its way of life from military attack and hostile foreign
influence, whether espionage, predatory trade practices, drug and human
trafficking, destructive propaganda and influence operations, cultural
subversion, or any other threat to our nation.</p>
<p>We want full control over our borders, over our immigration system,
and over transportation networks through which people come into our
country—legally and illegally. We want a world in which migration is not
merely “orderly” but one in which sovereign countries work together to
stop rather than facilitate destabilizing population flows, and have
full control over whom they do and do not admit.</p>
<p>We want a resilient national infrastructure that can withstand
natural disasters, resist and thwart foreign threats, and prevent or
mitigate any events that might harm the American people or disrupt the
American economy. No adversary or danger should be able to hold America
at risk.</p>
<p>We want to recruit, train, equip, and field the world’s most
powerful, lethal, and technologically advanced military to protect our
interests, deter wars, and—if necessary—win them quickly and decisively,
with the lowest possible casualties to our forces. And we want a
military in which every single servicemember is proud of their country
and confident in their mission.</p>
<p>We want the world’s most robust, credible, and modern nuclear
deterrent, plus next-generation missile defenses—including a Golden Dome
for the American homeland—to protect the American people, American
assets overseas, and American allies.</p>
<p>We want the world’s strongest, most dynamic, most innovative, and
most advanced economy. The U.S. economy is the bedrock of the American
way of life, which promises and delivers widespread and broad-based
prosperity, creates upward mobility, and rewards hard work. Our economy
is also the bedrock of our global position and the necessary foundation
of our military.</p>
<p>We want the world’s most robust industrial base. American national
power depends on a strong industrial sector capable of meeting both
peacetime and wartime production demands. That requires not only direct
defense industrial production capacity but also defense-related
production capacity. Cultivating American industrial strength must
become the highest priority of national economic policy.</p>
<p>We want the world’s most robust, productive, and innovative energy
sector—one capable not just of fueling American economic growth but of
being one of America’s leading export industries in its own right.</p>
<p>We want to remain the world’s most scientifically and technologically
advanced and innovative country, and to build on these strengths. And we
want to protect our intellectual property from foreign theft. America’s
pioneering spirit is a key pillar of our continued economic dominance
and military superiority; it must be preserved.</p>
<p>We want to maintain the United States’ unrivaled “soft power” through
which we exercise positive influence throughout the world that furthers
our interests. In doing so, we will be unapologetic about our country’s
past and present while respectful of other countries’ differing
religions, cultures, and governing systems. “Soft power” that serves
America’s true national interest is effective only if we believe in our
country’s inherent greatness and decency.</p>
<p>Finally, we want the restoration and reinvigoration of American
spiritual and cultural health, without which long-term security is
impossible. We want an America that cherishes its past glories and its
heroes, and that looks forward to a new golden age. We want a people who
are proud, happy, and optimistic that they will leave their country to
the next generation better than they found it. We want a gainfully
employed citizenry—with no one sitting on the sidelines—who take
satisfaction from knowing that their work is essential to the prosperity
of our nation and to the well-being of individuals and families. This
cannot be accomplished without growing numbers of strong, traditional
families that raise healthy children.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>What Do We Want In and From the World?</li>
</ol>
<p>Achieving these goals requires marshaling every resource of our
national power. Yet this strategy’s focus is foreign policy. What are
America’s core foreign policy interests? What do we want in and from the
world?</p>
<p>• We want to ensure that the Western Hemisphere remains reasonably
stable and well-governed enough to prevent and discourage mass migration
to the United States; we want a Hemisphere whose governments cooperate
with us against narco-terrorists, cartels, and other transnational
criminal organizations; we want a Hemisphere that remains free of
hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets, and that supports
critical supply chains; and we want to ensure our continued access to
key strategic locations. In other words, we will assert and enforce a
“Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine;</p>
<p>• We want to halt and reverse the ongoing damage that foreign actors
inflict on the American economy while keeping the Indo-Pacific free and
open, preserving freedom of navigation in all crucial sea lanes, and
maintaining secure and reliable supply chains and access to critical
materials;</p>
<p>• We want to support our allies in preserving the freedom and
security of Europe, while restoring Europe’s civilizational
self-confidence and Western identity;</p>
<p>• We want to prevent an adversarial power from dominating the Middle
East, its oil and gas supplies, and the chokepoints through which they
pass while avoiding the “forever wars” that bogged us down in that
region at great cost; and</p>
<p>• We want to ensure that U.S. technology and U.S.
standards—particularly in AI, biotech, and quantum computing—drive the
world forward.</p>
<p>These are the United States’ core, vital national interests. While we
also have others, these are the interests we must focus on above all
others, and that we ignore or neglect at our peril.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>What Are America’s Available Means to Get What We Want?</li>
</ol>
<p>America retains the world’s most enviable position, with
world-leading assets, resources, and advantages, including:</p>
<p>• A still nimble political system that can course correct;</p>
<p>• The world’s single largest and most innovative economy, which both
generates wealth we can invest in strategic interests and provides
leverage over countries that want access to our markets;</p>
<p>• The world’s leading financial system and capital markets, including
the dollar’s global reserve currency status;</p>
<p>• The world’s most advanced, most innovative, and most profitable
technology sector, which undergirds our economy, provides a qualitative
edge to our military, and strengthens our global influence;</p>
<p>• The world’s most powerful and capable military;</p>
<p>• A broad network of alliances, with treaty allies and partners in
the world’s most strategically important regions;</p>
<p>• An enviable geography with abundant natural resources, no competing
powers physically dominant in our Hemisphere, borders at no risk of
military invasion, and other great powers separated by vast oceans;</p>
<p>• Unmatched “soft power” and cultural influence; and</p>
<p>• The courage, willpower, and patriotism of the American people.</p>
<p>In addition, through President Trump’s robust domestic agenda, the
United States is:</p>
<p>• Re-instilling a culture of competence, rooting out so-called “DEI”
and other discriminatory and anti-competitive practices that degrade our
institutions and hold us back;</p>
<p>• Unleashing our enormous energy production capacity as a strategic
priority to fuel growth and innovation, and to bolster and rebuild the
middle class;</p>
<p>• Reindustrializing our economy, again to further support the middle
class and control our own supply chains and production capacities;</p>
<p>• Returning economic freedom to our citizens via historic tax cuts
and deregulatory efforts, making the United States the premier place to
do business and invest capital; and</p>
<p>• Investing in emerging technologies and basic science, to ensure our
continued prosperity, competitive advantage, and military dominance for
future generations.</p>
<p>The goal of this strategy is to tie together all of these
world-leading assets, and others, to strengthen American power and
preeminence and make our country even greater than it ever has been.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>The Strategy</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>Principles</li>
</ol>
<p>President Trump’s foreign policy is pragmatic without being
“pragmatist,” realistic without being “realist,” principled without
being “idealistic,” muscular without being “hawkish,” and restrained
without being “dovish.” It is not grounded in traditional, political
ideology. It is motivated above all by what works for America—or, in two
words, “America First.”</p>
<p>President Trump has cemented his legacy as The President of Peace. In
addition to the remarkable success achieved during his first term with
the historic Abraham Accords, President Trump has leveraged his
dealmaking ability to secure unprecedented peace in eight conflicts
throughout the world over the course of just eight months of his second
term. He negotiated peace between Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and
Serbia, the DRC and Rwanda, Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt
and Ethiopia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and ended the war in Gaza with all
living hostages returned to their families.</p>
<p>Stopping regional conflicts before they spiral into global wars that
drag down whole continents is worthy of the Commander-in-Chief’s
attention, and a priority for this administration. A world on fire,
where wars come to our shores, is bad for American interests. President
Trump uses unconventional diplomacy, America’s military might, and
economic leverage to surgically extinguish embers of division between
nuclear-capable nations and violent wars caused by centuries-long
hatred.</p>
<p>President Trump has proven that American foreign, defense, and
intelligence policies must be driven by the following basic
principles:</p>
<p>• Focused Definition of the National Interest – Since at least the
end of the Cold War, administrations have often published National
Security Strategies that seek to expand the definition of America’s
“national interest” such that that almost no issue or endeavor is
considered outside its scope. But to focus on everything is to focus on
nothing. America’s core national security interests shall be our
focus.</p>
<p>• Peace Through Strength – Strength is the best deterrent. Countries
or other actors sufficiently deterred from threatening American
interests will not do so. In addition, strength can enable us to achieve
peace, because parties that respect our strength often seek our help and
are receptive to our efforts to resolve conflicts and maintain peace.
Therefore, the United States must maintain the strongest economy,
develop the most advanced technologies, bolster our society’s cultural
health, and field the world’s most capable military.</p>
<p>• Predisposition to Non-Interventionism – In the Declaration of
Independence, America’s founders laid down a clear preference for non-
interventionism in the affairs of other nations and made clear the
basis: just as all human beings possess God-given equal natural rights,
all nations are entitled by “the laws of nature and nature’s God” to a
“separate and equal station” with respect to one another. For a country
whose interests are as numerous and diverse as ours, rigid adherence to
non-interventionism is not possible. Yet this predisposition should set
a high bar for what constitutes a justified intervention.</p>
<p>• Flexible Realism – U.S. policy will be realistic about what is
possible and desirable to seek in its dealings with other nations. We
seek good relations and peaceful commercial relations with the nations
of the world without imposing on them democratic or other social change
that differs widely from their traditions and histories. We recognize
and affirm that there is nothing inconsistent or hypocritical in acting
according to such a realistic assessment or in maintaining good
relations with countries whose governing systems and societies differ
from ours even as we push like-minded friends to uphold our shared
norms, furthering our interests as we do so.</p>
<p>• Primacy of Nations – The world’s fundamental political unit is and
will remain the nation-state. It is natural and just that all nations
put their interests first and guard their sovereignty. The world works
best when nations prioritize their interests. The United States will put
our own interests first and, in our relations with other nations,
encourage them to prioritize their own interests as well. We stand for
the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping
incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations, and for
reforming those institutions so that they assist rather than hinder
individual sovereignty and further American interests.</p>
<p>• Sovereignty and Respect – The United States will unapologetically
protect our own sovereignty. This includes preventing its erosion by
transnational and international organizations, attempts by foreign
powers or entities to censor our discourse or curtail our citizens’ free
speech rights, lobbying and influence operations that seek to steer our
policies or involve us in foreign conflicts, and the cynical
manipulation of our immigration system to build up voting blocs loyal to
foreign interests within our country. The United States will chart our
own course in the world and determine our own destiny, free of outside
interference.</p>
<p>• Balance of Power – The United States cannot allow any nation to
become so dominant that it could threaten our interests. We will work
with allies and partners to maintain global and regional balances of
power to prevent the emergence of dominant adversaries. As the United
States rejects the ill-fated concept of global domination for itself, we
must prevent the global, and in some cases even regional, domination of
others. This does not mean wasting blood and treasure to curtail the
influence of all the world’s great and middle powers. The outsized
influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations is a timeless truth of
international relations. This reality sometimes entails working with
partners to thwart ambitions that threaten our joint interests.</p>
<p>• Pro-American Worker – American policy will be pro-worker, not
merely pro-growth, and it will prioritize our own workers. We must
rebuild an economy in which prosperity is broadly based and widely
shared, not concentrated at the top or localized in certain industries
or a few parts of our country.</p>
<p>• Fairness – From military alliances to trade relations and beyond,
the United States will insist on being treated fairly by other
countries. We will no longer tolerate, and can no longer afford,
free-riding, trade imbalances, predatory economic practices, and other
impositions on our nation’s historic goodwill that disadvantage our
interests. As we want our allies to be rich and capable, so must our
allies see that it is in their interest that the United States also
remain rich and capable. In particular, we expect our allies to spend
far more of their national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on their own
defense, to start to make up for the enormous imbalances accrued over
decades of much greater spending by the United States.</p>
<p>• Competence and Merit – American prosperity and security depend on
the development and promotion of competence. Competence and merit are
among our greatest civilizational advantages: where the best Americans
are hired, promoted, and honored, innovation and prosperity follow.
Should competence be destroyed or systematically discouraged, complex
systems that we take for granted—from infrastructure to national
security to education and research—will cease to function. Should merit
be smothered, America’s historic advantages in science, technology,
industry, defense, and innovation will evaporate. The success of radical
ideologies that seek to replace competence and merit with favored group
status would render America unrecognizable and unable to defend itself.
At the same time, we cannot allow meritocracy to be used as a
justification to open America’s labor market to the world in the name of
finding “global talent” that undercuts American workers. In our every
principle and action, America and Americans must always come first.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Priorities</li>
</ol>
<p>• The Era of Mass Migration Is Over – Who a country admits into its
borders—in what numbers and from where—will inevitably define the future
of that nation. Any country that considers itself sovereign has the
right and duty to define its future. Throughout history, sovereign
nations prohibited uncontrolled migration and granted citizenship only
rarely to foreigners, who also had to meet demanding criteria. The
West’s experience over the past decades vindicates this enduring wisdom.
In countries throughout the world, mass migration has strained domestic
resources, increased violence and other crime, weakened social cohesion,
distorted labor markets, and undermined national security. The era of
mass migration must end. Border security is the primary element of
national security. We must protect our country from invasion, not just
from unchecked migration but from cross-border threats such as
terrorism, drugs, espionage, and human trafficking. A border controlled
by the will of the American people as implemented by their government is
fundamental to the survival of the United States as a sovereign
republic.</p>
<p>• Protection of Core Rights and Liberties – The purpose of the
American government is to secure the God-given natural rights of
American citizens. To this end, departments and agencies of the United
States Government have been granted fearsome powers. Those powers must
never be abused, whether under the guise of “deradicalization,”
“protecting our democracy,” or any other pretext. When and where those
powers are abused, abusers must be held accountable. In particular, the
rights of free speech, freedom of religion and of conscience, and the
right to choose and steer our common government are core rights that
must never be infringed. Regarding countries that share, or say they
share, these principles, the United States will advocate strongly that
they be upheld in letter and spirit. We will oppose elite-driven,
anti-democratic restrictions on core liberties in Europe, the
Anglosphere, and the rest of the democratic world, especially among our
allies.</p>
<p>• Burden-Sharing and Burden-Shifting – The days of the United States
propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over. We count among
our many allies and partners dozens of wealthy, sophisticated nations
that must assume primary responsibility for their regions and contribute
far more to our collective defense. President Trump has set a new global
standard with the Hague Commitment, which pledges NATO countries to
spend 5 percent of GDP on defense and which our NATO allies have
endorsed and must now meet. Continuing President Trump’s approach of
asking allies to assume primary responsibility for their regions, the
United States will organize a burden-sharing network, with our
government as convener and supporter. This approach ensures that burdens
are shared and that all such efforts benefit from broader legitimacy.
The model will be targeted partnerships that use economic tools to align
incentives, share burdens with like-minded allies, and insist on reforms
that anchor long-term stability. This strategic clarity will allow the
United States to counter hostile and subversive influences efficiently
while avoiding the overextension and diffuse focus that undermined past
efforts. The United States will stand ready to help— potentially through
more favorable treatment on commercial matters, technology sharing, and
defense procurement—those counties that willingly take more
responsibility for security in their neighborhoods and align their
export controls with ours.</p>
<p>• Realignment Through Peace – Seeking peace deals at the President’s
direction, even in regions and countries peripheral to our immediate
core interests, is an effective way to increase stability, strengthen
America’s global influence, realign countries and regions toward our
interests, and open new markets. The resources required boil down to
presidential diplomacy, which our great nation can embrace only with
competent leadership. The dividends—an end to longstanding conflicts,
lives saved, new friends made—can vastly outweigh the relatively minor
costs of time and attention.</p>
<p>• Economic Security – Finally, because economic security is
fundamental to national security, we will work to further strengthen the
American economy, with emphases on:</p>
<p>o Balanced Trade – The United States will prioritize rebalancing our
trade relations, reducing trade deficits, opposing barriers to our
exports, and ending dumping and other anti-competitive practices that
hurt American industries and workers. We seek fair, reciprocal trade
deals with nations that want to trade with us on a basis of mutual
benefit and respect. But our priorities must and will be our own
workers, our own industries, and our own national security.</p>
<p>o Securing Access to Critical Supply Chains and Materials – As
Alexander Hamilton argued in our republic’s earliest days, the United
States must never be dependent on any outside power for core
components—from raw materials to parts to finished products— necessary
to the nation’s defense or economy. We must re-secure our own
independent and reliable access to the goods we need to defend ourselves
and preserve our way of life. This will require expanding American
access to critical minerals and materials while countering predatory
economic practices. Moreover, the Intelligence Community will monitor
key supply chains and technological advances around the world to ensure
we understand and mitigate vulnerabilities and threats to American
security and prosperity.</p>
<p>o Reindustrialization – The future belongs to makers. The United
States will reindustrialize its economy, “re-shore” industrial
production, and encourage and attract investment in our economy and our
workforce, with a focus on the critical and emerging technology sectors
that will define the future. We will do so through the strategic use of
tariffs and new technologies that favor widespread industrial production
in every corner of our nation, raise living standards for American
workers, and ensure that our country is never again reliant on any
adversary, present or potential, for critical products or
components.</p>
<p>o Reviving our Defense Industrial Base – A strong, capable military
cannot exist without a strong, capable defense industrial base. The huge
gap, demonstrated in recent conflicts, between low-cost drones and
missiles versus the expensive systems required to defend against them
has laid bare our need to change and adapt. America requires a national
mobilization to innovate powerful defenses at low cost, to produce the
most capable and modern systems and munitions at scale, and to re-shore
our defense industrial supply chains. In particular, we must provide our
warfighters with the full range of capabilities, ranging from low-cost
weapons that can defeat most adversaries up to the most capable high-end
systems necessary for a conflict with a sophisticated enemy. And to
realize President Trump’s vision of peace through strength, we must do
so quickly. We will also encourage the revitalization of the industrial
bases of all our allies and partners to strengthen collective
defense.</p>
<p>o Energy Dominance – Restoring American energy dominance (in oil,
gas, coal, and nuclear) and reshoring the necessary key energy
components is a top strategic priority. Cheap and abundant energy will
produce well-paying jobs in the United States, reduce costs for American
consumers and businesses, fuel reindustrialization, and help maintain
our advantage in cutting-edge technologies such as AI. Expanding our net
energy exports will also deepen relationships with allies while
curtailing the influence of adversaries, protect our ability to defend
our shores, and—when and where necessary—enables us to project power. We
reject the disastrous “climate change” and “Net Zero” ideologies that
have so greatly harmed Europe, threaten the United States, and subsidize
our adversaries.</p>
<p>o Preserving and Growing America’s Financial Sector Dominance – The
United States boasts the world’s leading financial and capital markets,
which are pillars of American influence that afford policymakers
significant leverage and tools to advance America’s national security
priorities. But our leadership position cannot be taken for granted.
Preserving and growing our dominance entails leveraging our dynamic free
market system and our leadership in digital finance and innovation to
ensure that our markets continue to be the most dynamic, liquid, and
secure and remain the envy of the world.</p>

<li>The Regions</li>
</ol>
<p>It has become customary for documents such as this to mention every
part of the world and issue, on the assumption that any oversight
signifies a blind spot or a snub. As a result, such documents become
bloated and unfocused—the opposite of what a strategy should be.</p>
<p>To focus and prioritize is to choose—to acknowledge that not
everything matters equally, to everyone. It is not to assert that any
peoples, regions, or countries are somehow intrinsically unimportant.
The United States is by every measure the most generous nation in
history—yet we cannot afford to be equally attentive to every region and
every problem in the world.</p>
<p>The purpose of national security policy is the protection of core
national interests—some priorities transcend regional confines. For
instance, terrorist activity in an otherwise less consequential area
might force our urgent attention. But leaping from that necessity to
sustained attention to the periphery is a mistake.</p>
<p>A. Western Hemisphere: The Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine</p>
<p>After years of neglect, the United States will reassert and enforce
the Monroe Doctrine to restore American preeminence in the Western
Hemisphere, and to protect our homeland and our access to key
geographies throughout the region. We will deny non-Hemispheric
competitors the ability to position forces or other threatening
capabilities, or to own or control strategically vital assets, in our
Hemisphere. This “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine is a
common-sense and potent restoration of American power and priorities,
consistent with American security interests.</p>
<p>Our goals for the Western Hemisphere can be summarized as “Enlist and
Expand.” We will enlist established friends in the Hemisphere to control
migration, stop drug flows, and strengthen stability and security on
land and sea. We will expand by cultivating and strengthening new
partners while bolstering our own nation’s appeal as the Hemisphere’s
economic and security partner of choice.</p>
<p>Enlist</p>
<p>American policy should focus on enlisting regional champions that can
help create tolerable stability in the region, even beyond those
partners’ borders. These nations would help us stop illegal and
destabilizing migration, neutralize cartels, near- shore manufacturing,
and develop local private economies, among other things. We will reward
and encourage the region’s governments, political parties, and movements
broadly aligned with our principles and strategy. But we must not
overlook governments with different outlooks with whom we nonetheless
share interests and who want to work with us.</p>
<p>The United States must reconsider our military presence in the
Western Hemisphere. This means four obvious things:</p>
<p>• A readjustment of our global military presence to address urgent
threats in our Hemisphere, especially the missions identified in this
strategy, and away from theaters whose relative import to American
national security has declined in recent decades or years;</p>
<p>• A more suitable Coast Guard and Navy presence to control sea lanes,
to thwart illegal and other unwanted migration, to reduce human and drug
trafficking, and to control key transit routes in a crisis;</p>
<p>• Targeted deployments to secure the border and defeat cartels,
including where necessary the use of lethal force to replace the failed
law enforcement-only strategy of the last several decades; and</p>
<p>• Establishing or expanding access in strategically important
locations.</p>
<p>The United States will prioritize commercial diplomacy, to strengthen
our own economy and industries, using tariffs and reciprocal trade
agreements as powerful tools. The goal is for our partner nations to
build up their domestic economies, while an economically stronger and
more sophisticated Western Hemisphere becomes an increasingly attractive
market for American commerce and investment.</p>
<p>Strengthening critical supply chains in this Hemisphere will reduce
dependencies and increase American economic resilience. The linkages
created between America and our partners will benefit both sides while
making it harder for non- Hemispheric competitors to increase their
influence in the region. And even as we prioritize commercial diplomacy,
we will work to strengthen our security partnerships—from weapons sales
to intelligence sharing to joint exercises.</p>
<p>Expand</p>
<p>As we deepen our partnerships with countries with whom America
presently has strong relations, we must look to expand our network in
the region. We want other nations to see us as their partner of first
choice, and we will (through various means) discourage their
collaboration with others.</p>
<p>The Western Hemisphere is home to many strategic resources that
America should partner with regional allies to develop, to make
neighboring countries as well as our own more prosperous. The National
Security Council will immediately begin a robust interagency process to
task agencies, supported by our Intelligence Community’s analytical arm,
to identify strategic points and resources in the Western Hemisphere
with a view to their protection and joint development with regional
partners.</p>
<p>Non-Hemispheric competitors have made major inroads into our
Hemisphere, both to disadvantage us economically in the present, and in
ways that may harm us strategically in the future. Allowing these
incursions without serious pushback is another great American strategic
mistake of recent decades.</p>
<p>The United States must be preeminent in the Western Hemisphere as a
condition of our security and prosperity—a condition that allows us to
assert ourselves confidently where and when we need to in the region.
The terms of our alliances, and the terms upon which we provide any kind
of aid, must be contingent on winding down adversarial outside
influence—from control of military installations, ports, and key
infrastructure to the purchase of strategic assets broadly defined.</p>
<p>Some foreign influence will be hard to reverse, given the political
alignments between certain Latin American governments and certain
foreign actors. However, many governments are not ideologically aligned
with foreign powers but are instead attracted to doing business with
them for other reasons, including low costs and fewer regulatory
hurdles. The United States has achieved success in rolling back outside
influence in the Western Hemisphere by demonstrating, with specificity,
how many hidden costs—in espionage, cybersecurity, debt-traps, and other
ways—are embedded in allegedly “low cost” foreign assistance. We should
accelerate these efforts, including by utilizing U.S. leverage in
finance and technology to induce countries to reject such
assistance.</p>
<p>In the Western Hemisphere—and everywhere in the world—the United
States should make clear that American goods, services, and technologies
are a far better buy in the long run, because they are higher quality
and do not come with the same kind of strings as other countries’
assistance. That said, we will reform our own system to expedite
approvals and licensing—again, to make ourselves the partner of first
choice. The choice all countries should face is whether they want to
live in an American-led world of sovereign countries and free economies
or in a parallel one in which they are influenced by countries on the
other side of the world.</p>
<p>Every U.S. official working in or on the region must be up to speed
on the full picture of detrimental outside influence while
simultaneously applying pressure and offering incentives to partner
countries to protect our Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Successfully protecting our Hemisphere also requires closer
collaboration between the U.S. Government and the American private
sector. All our embassies must be aware of major business opportunities
in their country, especially major government contracts. Every U.S.
Government official that interacts with these countries should
understand that part of their job is to help American companies compete
and succeed.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government will identify strategic acquisition and
investment opportunities for American companies in the region and
present these opportunities for assessment by every U.S. Government
financing program, including but not limited to those within the
Departments of State, War, and Energy; the Small Business
Administration; the International Development Finance Corporation; the
Export-Import Bank; and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. We should
also partner with regional governments and businesses to build scalable
and resilient energy infrastructure, invest in critical mineral access,
and harden existing and future cyber communications networks that take
full advantage of American encryption and security potential. The
aforementioned U.S. Government entities should be used to finance some
of the costs of purchasing U.S. goods abroad.</p>
<p>The United States must also resist and reverse measures such as
targeted taxation, unfair regulation, and expropriation that
disadvantage U.S. businesses. The terms of our agreements, especially
with those countries that depend on us most and therefore over which we
have the most leverage, must be sole-source contracts for our companies.
At the same time, we should make every effort to push out foreign
companies that build infrastructure in the region.</p>
<p>B. Asia: Win the Economic Future, Prevent Military Confrontation</p>
<p>Leading from a Position of Strength</p>
<p>President Trump single-handedly reversed more than three decades of
mistaken American assumptions about China: namely, that by opening our
markets to China, encouraging American business to invest in China, and
outsourcing our manufacturing to China, we would facilitate China’s
entry into the so-called “rules- based international order.” This did
not happen. China got rich and powerful, and used its wealth and power
to its considerable advantage. American elites—over four successive
administrations of both political parties—were either willing enablers
of China’s strategy or in denial.</p>
<p>The Indo-Pacific is already the source of almost half the world’s GDP
based on purchasing power parity (PPP), and one third based on nominal
GDP. That share is certain to grow over the 21st century. Which means
that the Indo-Pacific is already and will continue to be among the next
century’s key economic and geopolitical battlegrounds. To thrive at
home, we must successfully compete there—and we are. President Trump
signed major agreements during his October 2025 travels that further
deepen our powerful ties of commerce, culture, technology, and defense,
and reaffirm our commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>America retains tremendous assets—the world’s strongest economy and
military, world-beating innovation, unrivaled “soft power,” and a
historic record of benefiting our allies and partners—that enable us to
compete successfully.</p>
<p>President Trump is building alliances and strengthening partnerships
in the Indo- Pacific that will be the bedrock of security and prosperity
long into the future.</p>
<p>Economics: The Ultimate Stakes</p>
<p>Since the Chinese economy reopened to the world in 1979, commercial
relations between our two countries have been and remain fundamentally
unbalanced. What began as a relationship between a mature, wealthy
economy and one of the world’s poorest countries has transformed into
one between near-peers, even as, until very recently, America’s posture
remained rooted in those past assumptions.</p>
<p>China adapted to the shift in U.S. tariff policy that began in 2017
in part by strengthening its hold on supply chains, especially in the
world’s low- and middle- income (i.e., per capita GDP 3,800 or less)
countries—among the greatest economic battlegrounds of the coming
decades. China’s exports to low-income countries doubled between 2020
and 2024. The United States imports Chinese goods indirectly from
middlemen and Chinese-built factories in a dozen countries, including
Mexico. China’s exports to low-income countries are today nearly four
times its exports to the United States. When President Trump first took
office in 2017, China’s exports to the United States stood at 4 percent
of its GDP but have since fallen to slightly over 2 percent of its GDP.
China continues, however, to export to the United States through other
proxy countries.</p>
<p>Going forward, we will rebalance America’s economic relationship with
China, prioritizing reciprocity and fairness to restore American
economic independence. Trade with China should be balanced and focused
on non-sensitive factors. If America remains on a growth path—and can
sustain that while maintaining a genuinely mutually advantageous
economic relationship with Beijing—we should be headed from our present
0 trillion economy in 2025 to 0 trillion in the 2030s, putting our
country in an enviable position to maintain our status as the world’s
leading economy. Our ultimate goal is to lay the foundation for
long-term economic vitality.</p>
<p>Importantly, this must be accompanied by a robust and ongoing focus
on deterrence to prevent war in the Indo-Pacific. This combined approach
can become a virtuous cycle as strong American deterrence opens up space
for more disciplined economic action, while more disciplined economic
action leads to greater American resources to sustain deterrence in the
long term.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, several things are essential.</p>
<p>First, the United States must protect and defend our economy and our
people from harm, from any country or source. This means ending (among
other things):</p>
<p>• Predatory, state-directed subsidies and industrial strategies;</p>
<p>• Unfair trading practices;</p>
<p>• Job destruction and deindustrialization;</p>
<p>• Grand-scale intellectual property theft and industrial
espionage;</p>
<p>• Threats against our supply chains that risk U.S. access to critical
resources, including minerals and rare earth elements;</p>
<p>• Exports of fentanyl precursors that fuel America’s opioid epidemic;
and</p>
<p>• Propaganda, influence operations, and other forms of cultural
subversion.</p>
<p>Second, the United States must work with our treaty allies and
partners—who together add another 5 trillion in economic power to our
own 0 trillion national economy (together constituting more than half
the world economy)—to counteract predatory economic practices and use
our combined economic power to help safeguard our prime position in the
world economy and ensure that allied economies do not become subordinate
to any competing power. We must continue to improve commercial (and
other) relations with India to encourage New Delhi to contribute to
Indo-Pacific security, including through continued quadrilateral
cooperation with Australia, Japan, and the United States (“the Quad”).
Moreover, we will also work to align the actions of our allies and
partners with our joint interest in preventing domination by any single
competitor nation.</p>
<p>The United States must at the same time invest in research to
preserve and advance our advantage in cutting-edge military and dual-use
technology, with emphasis on the domains where U.S. advantages are
strongest. These include undersea, space, and nuclear, as well as others
that will decide the future of military power, such as AI, quantum
computing, and autonomous systems, plus the energy necessary to fuel
these domains.</p>
<p>Additionally, the U.S. Government’s critical relationships with the
American private sector help maintain surveillance of persistent threats
to U.S. networks, including critical infrastructure. This in turn
enables the U.S. Government’s ability to conduct real-time discovery,
attribution, and response (i.e., network defense and offensive cyber
operations) while protecting the competitiveness of the U.S. economy and
bolstering the resilience of the American technology sector.</p>
<p>Improving these capabilities will also require considerable
deregulation to further improve our competitiveness, spur innovation,
and increase access to America’s natural resources. In doing so, we
should aim to restore a military balance favorable to the United States
and to our allies in the region.</p>
<p>In addition to maintaining economic preeminence and consolidating our
alliance system into an economic group, the United States must execute
robust diplomatic and private sector-led economic engagement in those
countries where the majority of global economic growth is likely to
occur over the coming decades.</p>
<p>America First diplomacy seeks to rebalance global trade
relationships. We have made clear to our allies that America’s current
account deficit is unsustainable. We must encourage Europe, Japan,
Korea, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and other prominent nations in
adopting trade policies that help rebalance China’s economy toward
household consumption, because Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the
Middle East cannot alone absorb China’s enormous excess capacity. The
exporting nations of Europe and Asia can also look to middle-income
countries as a limited but growing market for their exports.</p>
<p>China’s state-led and state-backed companies excel in building
physical and digital infrastructure, and China has recycled perhaps .3
trillion of its trade surpluses into loans to its trading partners.
America and its allies have not yet formulated, much less executed, a
joint plan for the so-called “Global South,” but together possess
tremendous resources. Europe, Japan, South Korea, and others hold net
foreign assets of trillion. International financial institutions,
including the multilateral development banks, possess combined assets of
.5 trillion. While mission creep has undermined some of these
institutions’ effectiveness, this administration is dedicated to using
its leadership position to implement reforms that ensure they serve
American interests.</p>
<p>What differentiates America from the rest of the world—our openness,
transparency, trustworthiness, commitment to freedom and innovation, and
free market capitalism—will continue to make us the global partner of
first choice. America still holds the dominant position in the key
technologies that the world needs. We should present partners with a
suite of inducements—for instance, hightech cooperation, defense
purchases, and access to our capital markets—that tip decisions in our
favor.</p>
<p>President Trump’s May 2025 state visits to Persian Gulf countries
demonstrated the power and appeal of American technology. There, the
President won the</p>
<p>Gulf States’ support for America’s superior AI technology, deepening
our partnerships. America should similarly enlist our European and Asian
allies and partners, including India, to cement and improve our joint
positions in the Western Hemisphere and, with regard to critical
minerals, in Africa. We should form coalitions that use our comparative
advantages in finance and technology to build export markets with
cooperating countries. America’s economic partners should no longer
expect to earn income from the United States through overcapacity and
structural imbalances but instead pursue growth through managed
cooperation tied to strategic alignment and by receiving long-term U.S.
investment.</p>
<p>With the world’s deepest and most efficient capital markets, America
can help low- income countries develop their own capital markets and
bind their currencies more closely to the dollar, ensuring the dollar’s
future as the world’s reserve currency.</p>
<p>Our greatest advantages remain our system of government and dynamic
free market economy. Yet we cannot assume that our system’s advantages
will prevail by default. A national security strategy is, therefore,
essential.</p>
<p>Deterring Military Threats</p>
<p>In the long term, maintaining American economic and technological
preeminence is the surest way to deter and prevent a large-scale
military conflict.</p>
<p>A favorable conventional military balance remains an essential
component of strategic competition. There is, rightly, much focus on
Taiwan, partly because of Taiwan’s dominance of semiconductor
production, but mostly because Taiwan provides direct access to the
Second Island Chain and splits Northeast and Southeast Asia into two
distinct theaters. Given that one-third of global shipping passes
annually through the South China Sea, this has major implications for
the</p>
<p>U.S. economy. Hence deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by
preserving military overmatch, is a priority. We will also maintain our
longstanding declaratory policy on Taiwan, meaning that the United
States does not support any unilateral change to the status quo in the
Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>We will build a military capable of denying aggression anywhere in
the First Island Chain. But the American military cannot, and should not
have to, do this alone.</p>
<p>Our allies must step up and spend—and more importantly do—much more
for collective defense. America’s diplomatic efforts should focus on
pressing our First Island Chain allies and partners to allow the U.S.
military greater access to their ports and other facilities, to spend
more on their own defense, and most importantly to invest in
capabilities aimed at deterring aggression. This will interlink maritime
security issues along the First Island Chain while reinforcing</p>
<p>U.S. and allies’ capacity to deny any attempt to seize Taiwan or
achieve a balance of forces so unfavorable to us as to make defending
that island impossible.</p>
<p>A related security challenge is the potential for any competitor to
control the South China Sea. This could allow a potentially hostile
power to impose a toll system over one of the world’s most vital lanes
of commerce or—worse—to close and reopen it at will. Either of those two
outcomes would be harmful to the U.S. economy and broader U.S.
interests. Strong measures must be developed along with the deterrence
necessary to keep those lanes open, free of “tolls,” and not subject to
arbitrary closure by one country. This will require not just further
investment in our military—especially naval—capabilities, but also
strong cooperation with every nation that stands to suffer, from India
to Japan and beyond, if this problem is not addressed.</p>
<p>Given President Trump’s insistence on increased burden-sharing from
Japan and South Korea, we must urge these countries to increase defense
spending, with a focus on the capabilities—including new
capabilities—necessary to deter adversaries and protect the First Island
Chain. We will also harden and strengthen our military presence in the
Western Pacific, while in our dealings with Taiwan and Australia we
maintain our determined rhetoric on increased defense spending.</p>
<p>Preventing conflict requires a vigilant posture in the Indo-Pacific,
a renewed defense industrial base, greater military investment from
ourselves and from allies and partners, and winning the economic and
technological competition over the long term.</p>
<p>C. Promoting European Greatness</p>
<p>American officials have become used to thinking about European
problems in terms of insufficient military spending and economic
stagnation. There is truth to this, but Europe’s real problems are even
deeper.</p>
<p>Continental Europe has been losing share of global GDP—down from 25
percent in 1990 to 14 percent today—partly owing to national and
transnational regulations that undermine creativity and
industriousness.</p>
<p>But this economic decline is eclipsed by the real and more stark
prospect of civilizational erasure. The larger issues facing Europe
include activities of the European Union and other transnational bodies
that undermine political liberty and sovereignty, migration policies
that are transforming the continent and creating strife, censorship of
free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering
birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence.</p>
<p>Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable
in 20 years or less. As such, it is far from obvious whether certain
European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to
remain reliable allies. Many of these nations are currently doubling
down on their present path. We want Europe to remain European, to regain
its civilizational self-confidence, and to abandon its failed focus on
regulatory suffocation.</p>
<p>This lack of self-confidence is most evident in Europe’s relationship
with Russia. European allies enjoy a significant hard power advantage
over Russia by almost every measure, save nuclear weapons. As a result
of Russia’s war in Ukraine, European relations with Russia are now
deeply attenuated, and many Europeans regard Russia as an existential
threat. Managing European relations with Russia will require significant
U.S. diplomatic engagement, both to reestablish conditions of strategic
stability across the Eurasian landmass, and to mitigate the risk of
conflict between Russia and European states.</p>
<p>It is a core interest of the United States to negotiate an
expeditious cessation of hostilities in Ukraine, in order to stabilize
European economies, prevent unintended escalation or expansion of the
war, and reestablish strategic stability with Russia, as well as to
enable the post-hostilities reconstruction of Ukraine to enable its
survival as a viable state.</p>
<p>The Ukraine War has had the perverse effect of increasing Europe’s,
especially Germany’s, external dependencies. Today, German chemical
companies are building some of the world’s largest processing plants in
China, using Russian gas that they cannot obtain at home. The Trump
Administration finds itself at odds with European officials who hold
unrealistic expectations for the war perched in unstable minority
governments, many of which trample on basic principles of democracy to
suppress opposition. A large European majority wants peace, yet that
desire is not translated into policy, in large measure because of those
governments’ subversion of democratic processes. This is strategically
important to the United States precisely because European states cannot
reform themselves if they are trapped in political crisis.</p>
<p>Yet Europe remains strategically and culturally vital to the United
States. Transatlantic trade remains one of the pillars of the global
economy and of American prosperity. European sectors from manufacturing
to technology to energy remain among the world’s most robust. Europe is
home to cutting-edge scientific research and world-leading cultural
institutions. Not only can we not afford to write Europe off—doing so
would be self-defeating for what this strategy aims to achieve.</p>
<p>American diplomacy should continue to stand up for genuine democracy,
freedom of expression, and unapologetic celebrations of European
nations’ individual character and history. America encourages its
political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit, and the
growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for
great optimism.</p>
<p>Our goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory. We
will need a strong Europe to help us successfully compete, and to work
in concert with us to prevent any adversary from dominating Europe.</p>
<p>America is, understandably, sentimentally attached to the European
continent— and, of course, to Britain and Ireland. The character of
these countries is also strategically important because we count upon
creative, capable, confident, democratic allies to establish conditions
of stability and security. We want to work with aligned countries that
want to restore their former greatness.</p>
<p>Over the long term, it is more than plausible that within a few
decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority
non-European. As such, it is an open question whether they will view
their place in the world, or their alliance with the United States, in
the same way as those who signed the NATO charter.</p>
<p>Our broad policy for Europe should prioritize:</p>
<p>• Reestablishing conditions of stability within Europe and strategic
stability with Russia;</p>
<p>• Enabling Europe to stand on its own feet and operate as a group of
aligned sovereign nations, including by taking primary responsibility
for its own defense, without being dominated by any adversarial
power;</p>
<p>• Cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within
European nations;</p>
<p>• Opening European markets to U.S. goods and services and ensuring
fair treatment of U.S. workers and businesses;</p>
<p>• Building up the healthy nations of Central, Eastern, and Southern
Europe through commercial ties, weapons sales, political collaboration,
and cultural and educational exchanges;</p>
<p>• Ending the perception, and preventing the reality, of NATO as a
perpetually expanding alliance; and</p>
<p>• Encouraging Europe to take action to combat mercantilist
overcapacity, technological theft, cyber espionage, and other hostile
economic practices.</p>
<p>D. The Middle East: Shift Burdens, Build Peace</p>
<p>For half a century at least, American foreign policy has prioritized
the Middle East above all other regions. The reasons are obvious: the
Middle East was for decades the world’s most important supplier of
energy, was a prime theater of superpower competition, and was rife with
conflict that threatened to spill into the wider world and even to our
own shores.</p>
<p>Today, at least two of those dynamics no longer hold. Energy supplies
have diversified greatly, with the United States once again a net energy
exporter. Superpower competition has given way to great power jockeying,
in which the United States retains the most enviable position,
reinforced by President Trump’s successful revitalization of our
alliances in the Gulf, with other Arab partners, and with Israel.</p>
<p>Conflict remains the Middle East’s most troublesome dynamic, but
there is today less to this problem than headlines might lead one to
believe. Iran—the region’s chief destabilizing force—has been greatly
weakened by Israeli actions since October 7, 2023, and President Trump’s
June 2025 Operation Midnight Hammer, which significantly degraded Iran’s
nuclear program. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains thorny, but
thanks to the ceasefire and release of hostages President Trump
negotiated, progress toward a more permanent peace has been made.
Hamas’s chief backers have been weakened or stepped away. Syria remains
a potential problem, but with American, Arab, Israeli, and Turkish
support may stabilize and reassume its rightful place as an integral,
positive player in the region.</p>
<p>As this administration rescinds or eases restrictive energy policies
and American energy production ramps up, America’s historic reason for
focusing on the Middle East will recede. Instead, the region will
increasingly become a source and destination of international
investment, and in industries well beyond oil and gas— including nuclear
energy, AI, and defense technologies. We can also work with Middle East
partners to advance other economic interests, from securing supply
chains to bolstering opportunities to develop friendly and open markets
in other parts of the world such as Africa.</p>
<p>Middle East partners are demonstrating their commitment to combatting
radicalism, a trendline American policy should continue to encourage.
But doing so will require dropping America’s misguided experiment with
hectoring these nations—especially the Gulf monarchies—into abandoning
their traditions and historic forms of government. We should encourage
and applaud reform when and where it emerges organically, without trying
to impose it from without. The key to successful relations with the
Middle East is accepting the region, its leaders, and its nations as
they are while working together on areas of common interest.</p>
<p>America will always have core interests in ensuring that Gulf energy
supplies do not fall into the hands of an outright enemy, that the
Strait of Hormuz remain open, that the Red Sea remain navigable, that
the region not be an incubator or exporter of terror against American
interests or the American homeland, and that Israel remain secure. We
can and must address this threat ideologically and militarily without
decades of fruitless “nation-building” wars. We also have a clear
interest in expanding the Abraham Accords to more nations in the region
and to other countries in the Muslim world.</p>
<p>But the days in which the Middle East dominated American foreign
policy in both long-term planning and day-to-day execution are
thankfully over—not because the Middle East no longer matters, but
because it is no longer the constant irritant, and potential source of
imminent catastrophe, that it once was. It is rather emerging as a place
of partnership, friendship, and investment—a trend that should be
welcomed and encouraged. In fact, President Trump’s ability to unite the
Arab world at Sharm el-Sheikh in pursuit of peace and normalization will
allow the United States to finally prioritize American interests.</p>
<p>E. Africa</p>
<p>For far too long, American policy in Africa has focused on providing,
and later on spreading, liberal ideology. The United States should
instead look to partner with select countries to ameliorate conflict,
foster mutually beneficial trade relationships, and transition from a
foreign aid paradigm to an investment and growth paradigm capable of
harnessing Africa’s abundant natural resources and latent economic
potential.</p>
<p>Opportunities for engagement could include negotiating settlements to
ongoing conflicts (e.g., DRC-Rwanda, Sudan), and preventing new ones
(e.g., Ethiopia- Eritrea-Somalia), as well as action to amend our
approach to aid and investment (e.g., the Africa Growth and Opportunity
Act). And we must remain wary of resurgent Islamist terrorist activity
in parts of Africa while avoiding any long-term American presence or
commitments.</p>
<p>The United States should transition from an aid-focused relationship
with Africa to a trade- and investment-focused relationship, favoring
partnerships with capable, reliable states committed to opening their
markets to U.S. goods and services. An immediate area for U.S.
investment in Africa, with prospects for a good return on investment,
include the energy sector and critical mineral development.</p>
<p>Development of U.S.-backed nuclear energy, liquid petroleum gas, and
liquified natural gas technologies can generate profits for U.S.
businesses and help us in the competition for critical minerals and
other resources.</p>
