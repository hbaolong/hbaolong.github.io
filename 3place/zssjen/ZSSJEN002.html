warns of ongoing delays as services resume after Channel Tunnel power
issues</h4>
<p>Some Eurostar services have resumed after all trains from London to
Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels were cancelled due to a power outage in
the Channel Tunnel.</p>
<p>Trains that have not been cancelled will be subject to “severe delays
and possible last-minute cancellations“ following the tunnel’s partial
reopening, and passengers are advised to postpone their travel to a
different date, Eurostar said.</p>
<p>LeShuttle services - which carries road vehicles and passengers
through the tunnel between Folkestone and Calais - have also
resumed.</p>
<p>Earlier a problem with the overhead power supply and a broken down
LeShuttle train blocked all routes, causing travel chaos for thousands
trying to get away.</p>
<p>The rail operator suspended services until further notice.</p>
<p>By midday on Tuesday, at least a dozen Eurostar services between the
UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands had been cancelled.</p>
<p>The rail operator apologised and said passengers could rearrange
their plans free of charge or can cancel their booking and get a refund
or an e-voucher.</p>

</ul>
<p>Passengers told the BBC how they had been left stranded and looking
for alternative routes to get to their destination.</p>

<p>Two American tourists spent hundreds of pounds to reach Paris on
Wednesday after their Eurostar service was cancelled from London St
Pancras International.</p>
<p>Haley Adams, 38, and Hannah Hagar, 35, paid 80 (£430) for flights to
the French capital to celebrate Hannah’s 36th birthday there.</p>
<p>The pair had their Eurostar tickets refunded but said they will have
to pay for an extra night at a hotel in London and cannot get a refund
from the hotel they were going to stay at in Paris tonight.</p>
<p>“There’s been a lot of queuing,“ Adams said. “We have been here for
five hours.“</p>
<p>A family from Mexico said their trip of a lifetime has been cast into
doubt as their Eurostar service was cancelled.</p>
<p>Monserrat Hernandes, her brother John Paul and mother Olga were among
dozens of people looking frantically at their phones near the Eurostar
departure area at St Pancras.</p>
<p>The family got on the Eurostar just after 08:00 GMT but after their
train left for Paris it had to return due to the incident.</p>
<p>“They say nothing is travelling today… there’s no hope for leaving
tomorrow,“ she said.</p>
<p>They are now searching for a flight or a ferry to make it to
Paris.</p>
<ul>
<li>ferry,英 [ˈferi] 美 [ˈferi] n. 渡船，摆渡；渡口 v.
摆渡，渡运；空运</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“It’s like an American movie,“ she added. “Hopefully I find
the love of my life.“</strong></p>
<p>In France, Ben Clark, from Bedfordshire, said he had been stuck
on-board Le Shuttle in Calais with his wife and three daughters for
hours.</p>
<p>“The first two-and-a-half hours weren’t too bad but the girls have
got restless in the last half an hour so we’ve let them run around the
boarding carriage to burn off some energy,“ he said.</p>
<p>“Some people are getting angry but there’s nothing that can be done,
others are sleeping in their cars. We have used up our snacks and now
have no plan B or C.“</p>
<p>National Rail has advised passengers not to come to London St Pancras
International if their Eurostar train is cancelled, while the Department
for Transport said disruption is “likely for the remainder of the day“
while faulty overhead cables are repaired.</p>
<p>A photograph shared with the BBC by a train driver for Eurostar
appears to show overhead electrical cables strewn across the tracks.</p>
<p>Currently only one of two main tunnels in the Channel Tunnel is
available for trains to run on, Eurostar said.</p>
<p>Eurostar’s services resumed with the 15:04 train from London to
Brussels departing after 16:00.</p>
<p>As of 18:00, only a few services to Paris Gare du Nord and Brussels
were scheduled to depart London St Pancras International this
evening.</p>
<p>The broken down LeShuttle train was also moved out of the Channel
Tunnel. The operator said none of its passengers were stranded inside
the tunnel after the power failure caused its closure.</p>
<p>LeShuttle has apologised and warned of delays of approximately five
hours, telling passengers to “please check in as planned“.</p>
<p>The LeShuttle service “resumed very gradually on one track“ shortly
before 15:00 local time (14:00 GMT), the EuroTunnel Press Office
said.</p>
<p>“Service is operating alternately in both directions with significant
delays,“ it said, adding that “additional shuttles will be added in the
evening and until tomorrow morning“.</p>
<p>Traffic has also eased on the M20 after cars hoping to cross the
Channel Tunnel caused traffic jams near the LeShuttle Terminal in
Folkestone.</p>
