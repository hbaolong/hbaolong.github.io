election: For the popular People’s Party, winning the vote is only the
first hurdle</h4>
<ul>
<li>hurdle,英 [ˈhɜːd(ə)l] 美 [ˈhɜːrd(ə)l]
n. 障碍，难关；（供人或马在赛跑中跨越的）栏架，跨栏；跨栏赛跑，障碍赛跑；（把背叛者送往刑场的）囚笼

</ul>
<p>Suttasitt “Macky“ Pottasak is a typical candidate of Thailand’s
People’s Party: young, idealistic and hardworking.</p>
<ul>
<li>idealistic,英 [ˌaɪdiəˈlɪstɪk] 美 [ˌaɪdiəˈlɪstɪk] adj.
理想主义的，空想的；唯心主义者的，空想家的</li>
</ul>
<p>He gave up a career in TV drama production in Bangkok to run in the
last election, winning a rural seat near his home city of Nakhon
Ratchasima from an old, established political family. He has adopted the
hat and flag of Luffy, the main character in the Japanese anime series
One Piece, which has featured in recent youth protests in Asia. He makes
light-hearted videos about his party’s policies every day, which are
getting millions of views on social media.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>rural,英 [ˈrʊərəl] 美 [ˈrʊrəl] adj.
农村的，乡村的；有乡村特色的，有乡土气息的</p></li>
<li><p>anime,英 [ˈænɪmeɪ] 美 [ˈænɪmeɪˌˈɑːnimeɪ]

</ul>
<p>“Politics is something past generations made boring. I want to make
it fun,“ he says. “That’s why I brought in Luffy and my video
mini-series. We don’t have money to buy votes. We are just ordinary
citizens, but with a strong determination to solve the long-standing
problems. I think the villagers can see that.“</p>
<p>Opinion polls suggest that much of the Thai public agrees with the
People’s Party. They are polling consistently ahead of their rivals as
the election on Sunday draws near.</p>
<p>But in Thailand, winning an election is never enough.</p>
<p>The last one, less than three years ago, produced a surprise win for
the progressive Move Forward party, which had campaigned on promises of
root-and-branch political and economic reforms. These included making
Thailand’s powerful military, and its largest businesses, more
accountable, and reducing the heavy punishments under the notorious lese
majeste law.</p>
<p>But powerful conservative forces, in particular the unelected senate
and the constitutional court, blocked Move Forward from forming a
government, dissolved the party and banned its leaders from politics.
The court ruled that its proposals for the lese majeste law amounted to
an attempt to overthrow the entire political system.</p>
<p>Now, after three tumultuous years of short-lived coalition
administrations, the sacking of two prime ministers by the
constitutional court and a border war with Cambodia, the reformists are
making another bid for power, this time under a new name, the People’s
Party.</p>
<p>Their youthful energy and idealism still draw large and excited
crowds. At a rally in Nakhon Ratchasima the new party leader,
Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, a 38-year-old former software engineer, was
mobbed like a rock star, people queueing for selfies with him and
wrapping him in garlands of flowers.</p>
<p>Macky and two assistants tour his constituency on e-scooters, passing
irrigation canals, rice fields and the simple wooden houses
characteristic of north-eastern Thai villages, listening to the concerns
of the residents. They tell a story of a society under acute economic
stress, where the old engines of growth have stopped working.</p>
<p>The village head La-or Kohsantea says there are few decent jobs in
the area, so young people have to leave to find work. “No-one has helped
us with the problem of poverty,“ she says. Thailand has one of the
highest levels of household debt in Asia. GDP is growing at less than 2%
a year, far lower than neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>Kritsana Lohsantea, 28, is asking Macky to help him get a modest
social security payment when the electronics factory he works at closes
down later this year.</p>
<p>Like many young Thais in rural areas he left school at 15 with few
qualifications, but the low-skilled manufacturing jobs which helped
Thailand grow rapidly 30 or 40 years ago are now moving to lower-cost
locations like Vietnam.</p>
<p>Macky has also noticed how many elderly people there are in the area.
Thailand’s population has been falling for five years. Last year the
number of births fell 10 %, the highest rate in the world.</p>
<p>With so many young people leaving the village, Macky is proposing
local training and a better online system for organising care-givers, to
look after house-bound old people who no longer have family members
living with them.</p>
<p>The People’s Party stands out for its ambition to transform
Thailand.</p>
<p>It has prioritised amending the constitution, which was drafted under
military rule and gives a lot of power to unelected agencies like the
constitutional court to constrain elected governments. The party wants
to streamline the country’s extensive bureaucracy, modernise its
education system, and curb the power of the military and the biggest
businesses. It also supports amending the military-drafted constitution,
a question which will be put in a referendum at the same time as the
election.</p>
<p>Its two main rivals, Bhumjaithai, the party of Prime Minister Anutin
Charnvirakul, and Pheu Thai, the party of former prime minister Thaksin
Shinawatra, have focused instead on more crowd-pleasing policies.</p>
<p>Anutin has highlighted his nationalist credentials, pointing to the
hard line he took against Cambodia in the border war, and his support
for the military.</p>
<p>“I promise you I will protect our soil with my life,“ he told the
crowd at a rally in Bangkok. “If you want a prime minister the enemy
cannot intimidate, choose my party.“</p>
<p>He has also persuaded many MPs from other parties to defect to him,
and recruited technocrats known for their competence, to build
Bhumjaithai up into a leading conservative political force.</p>
<p>Pheu Thai, which built its past popularity on eye-catching populist
policies has promised to create nine new millionaires – in Thai baht –
every day through a national prize draw. Both parties are offering
subsidies and cash handouts, but many economists argue this kind of
instant help does little so solve the deep structural problems
confronting Thailand.</p>
<p>“This is barking up the wrong tree,“ says Apichat Satitniramai, a
professor of economics at Thammasat University. “These stimulus packages
are like painkillers, which are less effective the more we use
them.“</p>
<p>In his view the People’s Party is the only one thinking long-term,
rather than just about what is needed to win the election.</p>
<p>From the moment the People’s Party was founded in 2017, then called
Future Forward, by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a charismatic and
wealthy entrepreneur, it was viewed as a threat by powerful conservative
figures.</p>
<p>Thailand was under military rule at the time. The then-army chief
compared the party to the armed communist insurgency of the Cold War.
Some feared Thanathorn’s argument that everything in Thailand needed
reforming, might eventually include the monarchy, which conservatives
say must be untouchable.</p>
<p>After the party’s surprisingly strong performance in the 2019
election, the constitutional court, which had already disqualified other
parties and politicians seen as a threat to the status quo, barred
Thanathorn from political office for 10 years. This was over his
ownership of shares in a small publishing company, which was judged to
violate rules against politicians controlling news media.</p>
<p>Future Forward was dissolved by the court the following year, a
verdict which ignited large-scale student protests that lasted until the
end of the year, and for the first time, called for reform of the
monarchy.</p>
<p>By the time of the next election in 2023 the public hunger for change
was even greater, delivering the successor party, Move Forward, its
unexpected win, followed by the almost inevitable dissolution.</p>
<p>So, all eyes are on what happens after voting this weekend. If, as
the polls suggest, the People’s Party gets even more seats than last
time, it will be well ahead of its closest rival, though the polls show
none of the parties getting an overall majority of the 500 seats in
parliament. This time the senate is no longer allowed to take part in
choosing the next government.</p>
<p>Yet everyone in Thailand expects some kind of move to block the
People’s Party once again. A case has been filed against 44 of its
leading figures - including 15 of their parliamentary candidates - with
the National Anti-Corruption Commission, over their personal endorsement
of the lese majeste proposals.</p>
<p>That could be used to bar them all from politics. Two of their
candidates are also facing jail time under that law.</p>
<p>“They are afraid of us,“ Thanathorn told the BBC, as he prepared to
join a People’s Party campaign bus. “They are afraid of change. They
want tomorrow to be just like yesterday. They think dissolving our
parties, banning our leaders from politics, would make us smaller.</p>
<p>“In fact, we are getting bigger.“</p>
<p>Even if his party is allowed to join a government, the constraints on
what they can do in office remain in place. That is why they have made
reforming the constitution such a high priority, to dilute or end the
extraordinary powers that deeply conservative institutions like the
constitutional court have to unseat elected governments.</p>
<p>In that they are joined by rival party Pheu Thai, which saw two of
its prime ministers removed from office by the court during their two
years in power. But there are many hurdles to getting a new charter. The
process could take years, or it could easily be blocked.</p>
<p>“If Thailand was a functional democracy, none of this would have
happened,“ says Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, a political scientist from
Chulalongkorn University.</p>
<p>“We have regular elections, sometimes punctuated by military coups.
But elections only determine the representatives in the lower house of
parliament. They do not determine who governs. That is determined by
elite networks, and unelected institutions which have played a veto role
against the will of the voters.“</p>
