es Salaam water crisis: Festive mood in Tanzanian city dampened by
persistent shortages</h4>
<p>At first light in Tanzania’s main city Dar es Salaam, some of its six
million residents begin their day with a frantic search for water.</p>
<ul>
<li>frantic,英 [ˈfræntɪk] 美 [ˈfræntɪk] adj.
紧张忙乱的；（由于恐惧或担心）无法控制感情的，发狂似的</li>
</ul>
<p>Christmas is approaching, but the festive mood is dampened by the dry
pipes, as the city experiences serious water shortages.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>festive,英 [ˈfestɪv] 美 [ˈfestɪv] adj.
节日的；喜庆的；欢乐的</p></li>
<li><p>dampen,英 [ˈdæmpən] 美 [ˈdæmpən] v.
使潮湿，弄湿；减弱，抑制</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In some homes, plastic containers are stacked outside the door, ready
to be carried at a moment’s notice whenever word spreads that a nearby
tap is flowing again.</p>
<p>City authorities ration water. Homes get it once a week, but the wait
can stretch for weeks for some families. The crisis, caused by a drought
and rising demand, has persisted for months.</p>
<p>Many people are forced to turn to private vendors, who source their
water from boreholes and tanks. They are a respite for thousands of
families, but their high costs are a heavy burden to low-income
households.</p>
<p>Cedric Ndosi, who lives in Madale, north-west of the city, plans to
host guests for lunch on Christmas Day, but he is worried.</p>
<p>“Christmas is here and there is no water in our taps. We are forced
to buy water from shops for cooking and from water trucks for bathing,
but it’s expensive.</p>
<p>“We were used to spending money on drinks, but now even water for
cooking has become an added cost,“ he adds.</p>
<p>Furaha Awadhi, a mother of two living in Tegeta on the outskirts of
the city, says the price of water has risen from (£3) for 1,000 litres
to 0.</p>
<p>Cedric Mushi, who lives in Ubungo, west of Dar es Salaam</p>
<p>“It comes only once a week, usually in the late hours of the night,“
he says.</p>
<p>As a result of the prolonged dry spell since the end of the rainy
season in May, the water levels in rivers and groundwater that the city
depends on has sharply reduced, officials say.</p>
<p>The authorities say this has forced a cut in supplies from water
treatment plants. They also blame leaking pipes in the distribution
network, leading to water being lost.</p>
<p>Dar es Salaam, on the Indian Ocean coast, is among Africa’s
fastest-growing cities. Over the past two decades, its population has
more than doubled as an increasing number of people move in, looking for
better economic opportunities.</p>
<p>New neighbourhoods have spread far beyond the city’s original
boundaries, and even in good times, the available water supply could
barely serve its inhabitants.</p>
<p>For the festive season, Joyce Fredrick is planning to escape the heat
and the inconveniences of having no water.</p>
<p>“Here in Dar es Salaam it’s extremely hot, no rain, no water. We are
going to Arusha (in the north), where at least the weather is more
friendly,“ she tells the BBC.</p>
<p>Unlike many other major Tanzanian cities, Dar es Salaam has been
particularly vulnerable to the failure of the October to December rainy
season.</p>
<p>Even Dodoma, which often receives little rainfall throughout the
year, is less affected thanks to its man-made dams.</p>
<p>In contrast, Dar es Salaam lacks a nearby freshwater source, is
heavily populated, and experiences some of the country’s highest
temperatures, currently averaging around 33 °C.</p>
<p>Although it is next to the sea, there is no desalination plant to
make the ocean water usable for residents.</p>
<p>Much of the city’s drinking water (about 70%) comes from the Ruvu
River, whose flow is closely linked to seasonal rainfall inland.</p>
<p>Smaller volumes are drawn from other rivers and from sources such as
boreholes, but these provide only limited relief when rains fail.</p>
<p>When the Ruvu’s flow drops, as has happened this time, the effects
are felt almost immediately, especially in high-lying areas and newly
developed suburbs of the city.</p>
<p>The impact is widespread but uneven, depending on a household’s
economic status.</p>
<p>People have invariably adapted to the uncertainty: some stay awake
until morning not to miss the rush of water in their pipes, others line
their rooftops and courtyards with containers to store every precious
drop of water from the little rain that falls.</p>
<p>For small business owners, the crisis has become an acute strain.
Some food vendors, salon operators, and car wash businesses have cut
back hours or raised prices.</p>
<p>Women are often seen looking for water for their homes.</p>
<p>“When water is scarce, everything else stops. At times hygiene
suffers, stress increases, especially for us mothers, and the whole
household feels the impact,“ says Tegemeo Kombe, who lives in Kibamba,
west of the city.</p>
<p>The government has acknowledged the severity of the problem. Water
Minister Juma Aweso told the BBC that Dar es Salaam’s dependence on
rainfall-fed rivers had left it particularly exposed.</p>
<p>“Longer-term solutions are under way, we are in the process of
building a dam that will collect water from different fresh water
sources to solve the problem in future,“ he said.</p>
<p>Aweso added that investments in the drilling of more boreholes will
help meet future demand and protect the city against climate shocks.</p>
<p>The Dar es Salaam Water and Sanitation Authority (Dawasa) has
apologised to residents for the disruption in their lives, and has
appealed to them to conserve water.</p>
<p>Critics however have called for better communication, clearer
rationing schedules and faster implementation of long-promised
projects.</p>
<p>And while some are concerned that water shortages risk becoming more
frequent, Ms Fredrick is hopeful that the situation will improve.</p>
<p>“When water is missing, life changes too,“ she tells the BBC. “We
believe things will be better next year.“</p>
