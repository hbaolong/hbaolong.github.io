ghost ships in the English Channel and the question of what to do about
them</h4>
<p>Listen to Paul read this article</p>
<p>On 26 January, staff in an office in Mumbai received an urgent e-mail
from a crew member aboard a tanker off the coast of Singapore.</p>
<p>The email, purportedly written on behalf of five colleagues aboard
the tanker sailing under the name Beeta, contained a litany of
complaints: crew members, it was alleged, had not been paid and were
being treated “like animals“; and provisions were running low.</p>
<ul>
<li>litany,英 [ˈlɪtəni] 美 [ˈlɪtəni] n. 冗长而枯燥的陈述；连祷</li>
</ul>
<p>The staff in Mumbai worked for the International Transport Workers
Federation (ITF), the world’s leading organisation representing
seafarers, and were used to dealing with complaints from all corners of
the globe.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>mumbai,英 [ˌmʊmˈbaɪ] 美 [mʌmˈbaɪ] n. 孟买（印度城市）</p></li>
<li><p>seafarer,英 [ˈsiːfeərə(r)] 美 [ˈsiːferər]
n. 船员；航海家</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But what caught their eye was the fact that the emails hadn’t just
been copied to multiple ITF offices, but also to sanctions enforcement
bodies in several countries.</p>
<ul>
<li>sanction,英 [ˈsæŋkʃn] 美 [ˈsæŋkʃ(ə)n]
n. 制裁；处罚，惩罚；（正式）许可，批准；<史>（尤指基督教会的）法令，法律；（伦理学）约束力；支持，鼓励

n. 船，舰；（人或动物的）血管，（植物的）导管；（盛液体用的）容器，器皿；（有某种特质或用途的）人</li>
</ul>
<p>He said he had discovered that the vessel calling itself the Beeta
was in fact an American-sanctioned tanker called the Gale.</p>
<p>The sailor and his colleagues were desperate to leave.</p>
<ul>
<li>desperate,英 [ˈdespərət] 美 [ˈdespərət] adj.
不顾一切的，拼命的；极需要的，渴望的；极严重的，极危险的；绝望的，无望的；绝望的，无望的</li>
</ul>
<p>“I’ve been at sea for many years,“ he told the BBC when we contacted
him. “I know what’s right and wrong.“</p>
<p>Inadvertently, the crew member had found himself involved in a
problem at the heart of some of today’s most contentious geopolitical
issues: a surging number of tankers, transporting Russian and Iranian
oil, operating outside maritime rules, using a variety of methods to
conceal their identities.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Estimates vary, but the latest data from the monitoring group
TankerTrackers.com says the fleet currently consists of 1,468 vessels,
roughly triple its size at the time of Russia’s full-scale invasion of
Ukraine four years ago.</p>
<p>That’s about 18-19% of the total internationally trading tanker
fleet, carrying approximately 17% of all seaborne crude, says Michelle
Wiese Bockman, senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI.</p>

<p>Definitions vary - as do names: it’s also been called the “dark“ or
“ghost“ fleet - but shadow vessels generally exhibit some or all of a
particular set of characteristics.</p>
<p>They tend to be old, averaging an age of around 20 years, and are
often poorly maintained. Details of ownership and management are
deliberately opaque - names, identification numbers and flags are
frequently changed. Insurance is below Western standards and sometimes
fake.</p>
<ul>
<li>opaque,英 [əʊˈpeɪk] 美 [oʊˈpeɪk] adj.
（玻璃、液体等）不透明的，不透光的；难懂的，隐晦的；迟钝的
n. 不透明体；（用于底片）不透明颜料 v. 使不透明</li>
</ul>
<p>Vessels frequently switch off or manipulate their automatic
identification system (AIS), making them harder to track.</p>
<ul>

操纵，摆布；操作，使用；正骨，推拿；篡改；巧妙地移动（某物），巧妙地处理（某事）；校正，转移（储存在计算机上的信息）</li>
</ul>
<p>Seamen, recruited on contracts that typically last six to nine
months, don’t always know what they’re getting into.</p>
<p>“I didn’t understand what shadow fleet vessels actually were,“
Russian engineer Denis told us, after serving aboard an EU- and
UK-sanctioned tanker, Serena, for several months last year.</p>
<p>Serena is currently flying under the flag of Cameroon. While Denis
was aboard, it was flying a false Gambian flag.</p>
<p>Denis says he realised the Serena was under sanctions only when he
went aboard. But like many seamen, he says he needed the work.</p>
<p>“Once they’re at sea, they’ve got them prisoner on board,“ says
Nathan Smith, an ITF inspector familiar with the Serena.</p>
<p>Smith has heard numerous stories of abuses aboard shadow vessels.</p>
<p>“<strong>It’s a modern-day slavery</strong>,“ he says.</p>
<p>Over the course of months spent sailing between Russia and China, the
reality of life aboard a shadow vessel became increasingly apparent to
Denis.</p>
<p>“Things began to deteriorate very quickly because no spare parts were
sent,“ he said. “The radar on the bridge hadn’t been working for over a
year, the life-saving equipment wasn’t working and there were numerous
faulty fire sensors.“</p>
<p>During a stop at the Russian port of Vladivostok, last October, the
crew tried, without success, to repair a davit, a small specialised
crane used to lower the tanker’s life boats into the water. Denis says a
port official nevertheless issued a certificate of successful
inspection. The BBC has approached the Port of Vladivostok for
comment.</p>
<p>Denis says he never found out who owned the Serena or who crew
members could contact to raise complaints.</p>
<p>It’s notoriously difficult to establish ownership of shadow fleet
vessels. Ships have registered owners, which are often shell companies
or entities set up to manage a single vessel. The names of real, or
“beneficial“ owners are frequently hidden. We have tried to make contact
with the owners of the Gale and Serena, but without success. In the case
of the Gale, it has proved impossible to establish the identity of the
beneficial owner.</p>
<ul>
<li>notoriously,英 [nəʊˈtɔːriəsli] 美 [noʊˈtɔːriəsli] adv.
众所周知地，声名狼藉地</li>
</ul>
<p>Crews are poorly protected throughout the industry, with unpaid wages
and abandonment by owners all-too frequent. But Denis says shadow
vessels are the worst.</p>
<ul>
<li>wager,英 [ˈweɪdʒə(r)] 美 [ˈweɪdʒər] n. 赌注；赌博；赌物 vi. 打赌 vt.
下赌注</li>
</ul>
<p>“Now I’ll be more careful,“ he says. “I’ve learned to identify
dangerous vessels that I won’t work on any more.“</p>
<p>Deep within the murky recesses of the shadow fleet also lurks a
category experts have dubbed “zombie ships“ - vessels which steal the
identity of dead ships in order to hide their true identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>murky,英 [ˈmɜːki] 美 [ˈmɜːrki] adj.
（液体）浑浊的；（尤指因浓雾而）昏暗的，阴暗的；（行为）不光彩的，不可告人的；复杂的，难以理解的</li>
</ul>
<p>After being sanctioned, a zombie ship often disappears from tracking
systems, later reappearing under a new name, using a stolen nine-digit
International Maritime Organisation (IMO) number from a scrapped or
decommissioned vessel.</p>
<ul>
<li>zombie,英 [ˈzɒmbi] 美 [ˈzɑːmbi]
n. 僵尸，还魂尸；无生气的人，麻木迟钝的人；（为黑客所控用来发送垃圾邮件等非法活动的）肉机；还魂神力鸡尾酒；蛇神</li>
</ul>
<p>The ship’s AIS tracking system, which uses transponders to
continuously broadcast its location, is re-programmed to imitate the
previous vessel.</p>
<ul>
<li>imitated,英 [ˈɪmɪteɪtɪd] 美 [ˈɪmɪˌteɪtɪd] adj. 模仿的；仿造的 v.
仿效；仿制（imitate 的过去分词）；类似</li>
</ul>
<p>With the dead tanker’s identity magically resurrected, the zombie
ship continues to ply its trade, free from sanctions.</p>
<ul>
<li>ply,英 [plaɪ] 美 [plaɪ] vt. 使用，不住地使用；折，弯；从事vi.
辛勤工作；定期地来往（船、车等）n. 厚度；板层；褶</li>
</ul>
<p>The Gale is one such ship.</p>
<p>According to the global trade intelligence company Kpler, the tanker,
currently flying a false Gambian flag, has assumed multiple identities
since being sanctioned by the US last year for its involvement in the
export of sanctioned Iranian oil.</p>
<p>After a period sailing under the false identity Sea Shell, using a
different stolen IMO number, the Gale again changed identities,
re-emerging as Beeta and loading a cargo of Iranian oil on 31
January.</p>
<ul>
<li>cargo,英 [ˈkɑːɡəʊ] 美 [ˈkɑːrɡoʊ] n. （船或飞机装载的）货物</li>
</ul>
<p>According to TankerTrackers.com, which uses satellite imagery, AIS
data and shoreline photography to follow the movement of crude oil, the
shipment was delivered by another US-sanctioned vessel via a
ship-to-ship transfer, a procedure commonly used by shadow-fleet vessels
involved in the shipment of sanctioned oil.</p>
<p>The ship-to-ship transfer took place south of the Riau Archipelago,
around 150 miles east of Singapore.</p>
<p>Windward AI’s Michelle Wiese Bockmann calls the area “an epicentre of
maritime lawlessness“, where dozens of tankers gather to store or
transfer Iranian oil.</p>
<p>Bockmann says China imported 1.8 million barrels per day of
sanctioned Iranian crude per day in 2025. The BBC has contacted the
Chinese embassy for a response.</p>
<p>“None of it was traced,“ she says, “because tankers hide their
loading and the oil has come on four or five tankers, deliberately to
obscure the origin and destination of the cargo.“</p>
<p>The Gale’s history and behaviour mark it out as a classic zombie
ship.</p>
<p>A computer screenshot taken on board by the crew member who contacted
the ITF appears to give instructions on how to fake the ship’s location,
a process known as spoofing.</p>
<p>Two other screenshots, taken on 26 January, show the spoofing at
work.</p>
<p>One displays the tanker’s actual location, east of Singapore. The
second, taken just five minutes later, shows a fake location, around
2,800 miles away, off the coast of the Indian state of Gujarat.</p>
<p>“The confirmed linkage between Gale, Sea Shell, and Beeta, alongside
fabricated AIS position history and prior impersonation, is consistent
with deliberate identity manipulation,“ says Ana Subasic, an analyst at
the global trade intelligence company Kpler.</p>
<p>The BBC has no reason to believe the Serena is a zombie vessel, but
the ship’s former engineer says he saw equipment that would enable the
Serena to fake its position.</p>
<p>“I spoke with the bridge officers about turning off the AIS and other
manipulation,“ Denis told us. “We had equipment on board to change the
vessel’s position. I think this equipment is only used for sanctioned
cargo.“</p>
<p>Such practices, coupled with the knowledge that Russian and Iranian
oil revenues continue to fuel conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East,
are driving an urgent debate in western capitals about how to
respond.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s recent actions in Venezuela – seizing seven tankers
since early December as part of a pressure campaign on the regime of
then president Nicolás Maduro – has shown that one solution is the
simple application of force.</p>
<p>The operation to chase and capture one vessel, the Russian-flagged
tanker Marinera, took the US military, including a coastguard vessel and
special forces, on a two-week chase far out into the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>The Marinera, previously known as the Guyanese-flagged Bella 1, was
wanted by the US for transporting sanctioned oil from both Venezuela and
Iran.</p>
<p>The change of name and flag was designed to provide the tanker with a
measure of international protection.</p>
<p>Upping the ante further, Russia took the highly unusual step of
requesting that the US call off its pursuit and said it had dispatched a
submarine to escort the tanker, which was empty at the time. The Russian
Foreign Ministry said there was not “any basis“ to allege the tanker was
sailing “without a flag“ or “under a false flag“.</p>
<p>Undeterred by the possibility of an international incident or by the
possible accusation of piracy on the high seas, the US intercepted the
Marinera in international waters between Iceland and the UK in the early
hours of 7 January.</p>
<p>For the first time, the UK got involved, sending an RAF surveillance
aircraft and a Royal Navy support ship to help the operation.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary John Healey said the action was “in full compliance
with international law“ and said the UK was “stepping up activity
against shadow vessels“.</p>
<p>Perhaps spurred on by Washington’s assertive approach, there is some
evidence that European partners are willing to take more robust action
too.</p>
<p>Two weeks after the Marinera episode, France launched an operation in
the Mediterranean to seize the Grinch, another Russia-linked tanker
suspected of violating international sanctions.</p>
<p>Once again, the UK was involved. A Royal Navy patrol boat, HMS
Dagger, shadowed the Grinch, as it passed through the Strait of
Gibraltar.</p>
<p>With at least one sanctioned vessel passing through the English
Channel every day, according to experts, speculation is mounting that
the UK might soon conduct its own interceptions.</p>
<p>Healey recently told MPs that “further military options“ were being
explored.</p>
<p>For some, it can’t come soon enough.</p>
<p>“There’s obviously huge frustration in the policy-maker circles in
Brussels and London that Russia is continuing to sell its oil,“ says Tom
Keatinge, founding director of the Centre for Finance and Security at
the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) in London.</p>
<p>Keatinge runs a maritime sanctions task force at Rusi, bringing
together representatives from industry and government. Some
participants, he sees, are keen to see more forthright action.</p>
<p>“We have people… who like jumping out of helicopters on ropes,“ he
says. “And that community has thus far been kept firmly in its box.“</p>
<p>He adds: “Put bluntly, no one’s had the balls to look at what is
often a 50-50 call and say ‘We’ll send the boys in’.“ The MoD said:
“Deterring, disrupting and degrading the Russian shadow fleet is a
priority for this government.“</p>
<p>But the constraints are considerable.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a bunch of consequences that you need to be ready to deal
with,“ Keatinge says. “The first is you’ve got an absolutely enormous
vessel. What the hell do you do with that?“</p>
<p>Once seized, tankers need to be maintained, with engines running and
a skeleton crew on board. The appetite for holding such vessels,
particularly older ones that might pose an environmental risk, is
minimal.</p>
<p>The Marinera remains moored in the Moray Firth, with other US-seized
vessels being held off the coast of Texas and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>“If you look at the very high costs that the US is probably incurring
at the moment to have two tankers off Houston, awaiting legal action,
it’s not something you take lightly,“ says Bockmann.</p>
<p>Then there’s the question of what to do with the oil itself.</p>
<p>Again, Trump’s approach is blunt: confiscate it.</p>
<p>The president says 50 million barrels have been taken so far, as the
US assumes control of Venezuela’s oil industry.</p>
<p>“Venezuela is going to get some and we’re going to get some,“ he said
in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The president’s European allies are unlikely to follow suit.</p>
<p>“That would probably be a step too far for the Foreign Office,“ says
Keatinge.</p>
<p>So would Ukraine’s increasingly direct approach. In recent months,
Kyiv has targeted at least seven Russian shadow fleet tankers, using a
variety of drones and mines.</p>
<p>Most of Ukraine’s attacks have been in the Black Sea, but one tanker,
the Qendil, was hit and critically damaged while passing through the
Mediterranean in December. Another tanker, the Mersin, was attacked and
immobilised off the coast of Senegal in late November. Kyiv has not
commented on reports that it carried out the attack.</p>
<p>Most of the international effort so far has been more bureaucratic
than kinetic: sanctioning hundreds of vessels, persuading countries such
as The Gambia, Sierra Leone and Comoros, among others, to tighten their
regulations, and addressing the issue of insurance.</p>
<p>The number of falsely flagged ships globally more than doubled last
year to over 450, according to the IMO, the BBC reported in
November.</p>
<p>Last year, the European Commission introduced new rules requiring all
vessels entering EU waters to provide proof of insurance.</p>
<p>The UK has a similar, voluntary reporting scheme, but shadow fleet
vessels often ignore it or alter course when challenged.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the sheer number of shadow vessels poses a simple problem
of resources.</p>
<p>But with Russian ships sometimes suspected of involvement in the
monitoring or sabotage of undersea cables, there’s an added national
security dimension.</p>
<p>In late January, the UK and thirteen other countries with Baltic and
North Sea coastlines issued a coordinated warning that AIS manipulation,
along with interference with Global Navigation Satellite Systems
represented a growing threat to maritime safety and security.</p>
<p>Vessels sailing under flags of convenience, the statement said, “may
be treated as a ship without nationality“, under the terms of the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea, a reminder to anyone paying attention
that existing laws already provide for the detention and seizure of
ships.</p>
<p>Windward AI’s Bockmann says the Trump administration’s actions over
Venezuela have shown European leaders what can be done.</p>
<p>“There’s definitely a low threshold [for intervention] building for
the darkest of the dark fleet,“ she says.</p>
<p>The net is gradually closing on Russian oil. Last October, the Trump
administration imposed sanctions on the country’s two largest oil
companies, Lukoil and Rosneft.</p>
<p>The EU’s next sanctions package against Russia may include a full ban
on maritime services, making it impossible for European tankers to
transport Russian oil under the legal price cap currently in place.</p>
<p>Around 30% of Russia’s maritime oil exports are currently carried on
EU-owned vessels.</p>
<p>But for Russia and Iran, war and sanctions are the mothers of
invention. As the net tightens, you can be sure that the world’s
burgeoning fleet of shadow vessels will continue to operate in the
dark.</p>
