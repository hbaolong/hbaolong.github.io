<h4 id="g20-will-trumps-no-show-eclipse-south-afxricas-moment">G20: Will
Trump’s no-show eclipse South Afxrica’s moment?</h4>
<p>When it assumed the presidency of the G20 last year, South Africa
hoped that as the first African country to host the gathering of world
leaders, it could champion issues that mattered the most to developing
nations.</p>
<p>For instance, it wanted the 20 heads of state from the world’s
biggest economies to consider arguments that borrowing should be cheaper
for developing countries, which pay two to four times more in interest
on debts than more advanced economies.</p>
<p>Other themes of this weekend’s summit include securing climate change
financing, increasing the participation of African countries in
multilateral forums and ensuring that they get the best value out of
their critical minerals.</p>
<p>But so far, discourse surrounding the meeting has been dominated by
Donald Trump’s very public decision not to attend.</p>
<p>The US president said he would not go due to the</p>
<p>The relationship between the two countries has become increasingly
fraught over the past year - the US expelled the South African
ambassador to Washington, cut some of its aid funding and slapped South
Africa with tariffs of 30% (the highest rate in sub-Saharan Africa).</p>
<p>And finally, after initially saying he would send Vice-President JD
Vance to the G20 summit, Trump abruptly announced two weeks ago that no
US representatives would attend.</p>
<p>The government in South Africa’s capital, Pretoria, has tried to
maintain a defiant but diplomatic tone. It has firmly denied claims of a
white genocide and insisted that the summit would proceed with or
without the US.</p>
<p>In a sudden about face, and with less than 48 hours to go before the
G20 conference, the US announced that it would be sending a small team
of its in-country diplomats to the handover ceremony, but that it
wouldn’t take part in any discussions.</p>
<p>As tension between the two nations shows no sign of letting up, there
are concerns that South African diplomats may be frozen out of meetings
when the US takes over the G20 presidency next year.</p>
<p>South Africa’s Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana, told reporters
earlier this week that there’s only one way they would not attend next
year’s meetings.</p>
<p>“We are members of the G20, we’re not an invited country. So we don’t
need an invitation from anybody,“ he said.</p>
<p>“If the United States do not want us to participate, the only way
they can do it is to decline us visas.“</p>
<p>So will South Africa manage to reach its aims without the presence of
the world’s wealthiest nation? Professor Richard Calland, from the
Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, thinks it can.</p>
<p>“I think that people who are serious-minded in their analysis will
not attach much weight to [the US’ absence],“ he says.</p>
<p>“Ironically, the absence of President Trump may create more space for
real consensus, because people won’t be constantly looking over their
shoulder at him and trying to anticipate or navigate his conduct and his
positioning.“</p>
<p>Prof Calland adds that the absence of the US may enable middle powers
to step up and push for the reforms they want by issuing a joint
declaration.</p>
<p>Answering reporters’ questions at the summit’s venue in Johannesburg
on Monday, South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola echoed this
sentiment.</p>
<p>“[The United States] are absent, so in their absence, the countries
that are present must make a decision.</p>
<p>“We are forging ahead to persuade the countries that are present that
we must adopt a leaders’ declaration because the institution cannot be
bogged down by someone who’s absent,“ he said.</p>
<p>The leaders’ declaration is a culmination of work done throughout the
year to build consensus on issues affecting the global economy,
including trade barriers, technological advancements and climate change.
It outlines what decisions the members have agreed to act on moving
forward.</p>
<p>President Trump isn’t the only head of state who will not be
attending. China’s Xi Jinping is sending his Premier Li Qiang, who has
represented the president in a number of meetings this year.</p>
<p>Russian leader</p>
<p>Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum is another leader who will not be
attending.</p>
<p>And Argentinian President and Trump ally, Javier Milei, is skipping
the summit in solidarity with Washington.</p>
<p>However, unlike the US, all of these countries are sending senior
delegations to represent their countries’ interests.</p>
<p>Mr Lamola was keen to downplay the significance of these absences,
saying sometimes heads of state are not able to attend major events, and
it is “nothing abnormal“ for them to send a replacement.</p>
<p>Other global powers have expressed their support of South Africa’s
presidency of the G20, including France, the UK and the European Union,
which signed a deal with South Africa on Thursday agreeing to boost the
extraction and, more importantly, the domestic processing, of critical
minerals.</p>
<p>African countries have long argued that processing minerals in their
countries before exporting them would boost their economies by providing
much-needed development, jobs and income.</p>
<p>These are the types of initiatives that Pretoria has spent the year
lobbying for across various working groups and ministerial meetings.</p>
<p>South Africa is the last G20 country to take over the presidency in
this current cycle. It’s also the last country in the global south to
host the gathering. Indonesia, India and Brazil have led the summit over
the past three years.</p>
<p>As such, the South African government says it wants to use its
presidency to bridge the developmental divide between the global north
and south. It wants to push for equity, sustainability and shared
prosperity.</p>
<p>Although building consensus through multilateral institutions like
the G20 is becoming increasingly fraught in a divided world, Prof
Calland argues that it is needed more than ever.</p>
<p>“Human life on Earth is facing an existential set of challenges,
whether it’s climate change, demographic shifts, technological
revolution and so on.</p>
<p>“All of these are hugely difficult pressure points for human society.
And you can’t deal with them unless there is international collaboration
and cooperation,“ he says.</p>
<p>President Trump and his supporters argue that multilateral
organisations do little to change real people’s lives, preferring
instead bilateral deals done directly between two countries.</p>
<p>But South Africa and other developing countries argue that issues
like reducing the cost of borrowing for poorer countries require the
input of international institutions like the IMF and cannot be done
through one-on-one deals.</p>
<p>In many ways, South Africa’s presidency of the G20 is part of a wider
debate around multilateralism and its effectiveness.</p>
<p>If South Africa is able to convince other G20 members to issue a
joint declaration on Sunday, it might have succeeded in proving that
consensus can be reached without the participation of the world’s most
powerful country.</p>
