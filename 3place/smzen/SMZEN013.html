<h4 id="section">12</h4>
<p>On the fourth day, the thugs reappeared. They had come to exact
payment from the women in the second ward, but they paused for a moment
at the door of the first ward to ask if the women there had yet
recovered from the sexual orgy of the other night, A great night, yes
sir, exclaimed one of them licking his chops and another confirmed,
Those seven were worth fourteen, it’s true that one of them was no great
shakes, but in the middle of all that uproar who noticed, their men are
lucky sods, if they’re man enough for them. It would be better if they
weren’t, then they’d be more eager. From the far end of the ward, the
doctor’s wife said, There are no longer seven of us, Has one of you
vamoosed, someone in the group asked, laughing, She didn’t vamoose, she
died, Oh, hell, then you lot will have to work all the harder next time,
It wasn’t much of a loss, she was no great shakes, said the doctor’s
wife. Disconcerted, the messengers did not know how to respond, what
they had just heard struck them as indecent, some of them even came
round to thinking that when all is said and done all women are bitches,
such a lack of respect, to refer to a woman like that, just because her
tits weren’t in the right place and she had no arse to speak of. The
doctor’s wife was looking at them, as they hovered there in the doorway,
undecided, moving their bodies like mechanical dolls. She recognised
them, she had been raped by all three of them. At last, one of them
tapped his stick on the ground, Let’s go, he said. Their tapping and
their warning cries, Keep back, keep back, it’s us, died away as they
made their way along the corridor, then there was silence, vague sounds,
the women from the second ward were receiving the order to present
themselves after dinner. Once more the tapping of sticks could be heard,
Keep back, keep back, the shadows of the three blind men passed through
the doorway and they were gone.</p>
<p>The doctor’s wife who had been telling the boy with the squint a
story, raised her arm and, without a sound, took the scissors from the
nail. She said to the boy, Later I’ll tell you the rest of the story. No
one in the ward had asked her why she had spoken with such disdain of
the blind woman who had suffered from insomnia. After a while, she
removed her shoes and went to reassure her husband, I won’t be long, I’m
coming straight back. She headed for the door. There she paused and
remained waiting. Ten minutes later the women from the second ward
appeared in the corridor. There were fifteen of them. Some were crying.
They were not in line, but in groups, tied to each other with strips of
cloth that had clearly been torn from their bedclothes. When they had
passed, the doctor’s wife followed them. Not one of them perceived that
they had company. They knew what awaited them, the news of the abuses
they would suffer was no secret, nor were these abuses anything really
new, for in all certainty this is how the world began. What terrified
them was not so much the rape, but the orgy, the shame, the anticipation
of the terrible night ahead, fifteen women sprawled on the beds and on
the floor, the men going from one to the other, snorting like pigs, The
worst thing of all is that I might feel some pleasure, one of the women
thought to herself. When they entered the corridor giving access to the
ward they were heading for, the blind man on the lookout alerted the
others, I can hear them, they’ll be here any minute. The bed being used
as a gate was quickly removed, one by one the women entered, Wow, so
many of them, exclaimed the blind accountant, as he counted them
enthusiastically, Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, fifteen,
there are fifteen of them. He went after the last one, put his eager
hands up her skirt, This one is game, she’s mine, he was saying. They
had finished sizing up the women and making a preliminary assessment of
their physical attributes. In fact, if all of them were condemned to
endure the same fate, there was no point in wasting time and cooling
their desire as they made their choice according to height and the
measurement of busts and hips. They were soon taking them off to bed,
already stripping them by force, and it was not long before the usual
weeping and pleas for mercy could be heard, but the replies when they
came, were always the same, If you want to eat, open your legs. And they
opened their legs, some were ordered to use their mouth like the one who
was crouched down between the knees of the leader of these ruffians and
this one was saying nothing. The doctor’s wife entered the ward, slipped
slowly between the beds, but she need not even have taken these
precautions, no one would have heard her had she been wearing clogs, and
if, in the middle of the fracas, some blind man were to touch her and
become aware that it was a woman, the worst that could happen to her
would be having to join the others, not that anyone would notice, in a
situation like this it is not easy to tell the difference between
fifteen and sixteen.</p>
<p>The leader of these hoodlums still had his bed at the far end of the
ward where the containers of food were stacked. The beds near his had
been removed, the fellow liked to move at will without having to keep
bumping into his neighbours. Killing him was going to be simple. As she
slowly advanced along the narrow aisle, the doctor’s wife studied the
movements of the man she was about to kill, how he threw his head back
as he took his pleasure, as if he were offering her his neck. Slowly,
the doctor’s wife approached, circled the bed and positioned herself
behind him. The blind woman went on doing what was expected of her. The
doctor’s wife slowly raised the scissors, the blades slightly apart so
that they might penetrate like two daggers. Just then, at the last
minute, the blind man seemed to be aware of someone’s presence, but his
orgasm had transported him from the world of normal sensations, had
deprived him of any reflexes, You won’t have time to come, the doctor’s
wife reflected as she brought her arm down with tremendous force. The
scissors dug deep into the blind man’s throat, turning on themselves
they struggled with the cartilage and the membraneous tissues, then
furiously went deeper until they came up against the cervical vertebrae.
His cry was barely audible, it might have been the grunting of an animal
about to ejaculate, as was happening to some of the other men, and
perhaps it was, and at the same time as a spurt of blood splashed on to
her face, the blind woman received the discharge of semen in her mouth.
It was her cry that startled the blind men, they were more than used to
hearing cries, but this was quite unlike the others. The blind woman was
screaming, where had this blood come from, probably, without knowing
how, she had done what it had crossed her mind to do and bitten off his
penis. The blind men left the women, approached groping their way,
What’s going on, what’s all this screaming, they asked, but the blind
woman now had a hand over her mouth, someone had whispered in her ear,
Be quiet, and then gently pulled her back, Say nothing, it was a woman’s
voice, and this calmed her, if that is possible in such distressing
circumstances. The blind accountant arrived ahead of the others, he was
the first to touch the body which had toppled across the bed, the first
to run his hands over it, He’s dead, he exclaimed almost immediately.
The head was hanging down on the other side of the bed, the blood was
still spurting out, They’ve killed him, he said. The blind men stopped
in their tracks, they could not believe their ears, How could they have
killed him, who killed him, They’ve made an enormous slit in his throat,
it must have been that whore who was with him, we’ve got to get her. The
blind men stirred once more, more slowly this time, as if they were
afraid of coming up against the blade that had killed their leader. They
could not see that the blind accountant was hastily rummaging through
the dead man’s pockets, that he was removing his gun and a small plastic
bag with about ten cartridges. Everyone was suddenly distracted by an
outcry from the women, already on their feet, in panic, anxious to get
away from that place, but some had lost any notion of where the ward
door was located, they went in the wrong direction and ran into the
blind men who thought the women were about to attack them, whereupon the
confusion of bodies reached new heights of delirium. At the far end of
the ward, the doctor’s wife quietly awaited the right moment to make her
escape. She had a firm grip on the blind woman, in her other hand she
held the scissors ready to land the first blow if any man should come
near her. For the moment, the free space was in her favour, but she knew
that she could not linger there. A number of women had finally found the
door, others were struggling to free themselves from the hands holding
them back, there was even the odd one still trying to throttle the enemy
and deliver another corpse. The blind accountant called out with
authority to his men, Keep calm, don’t lose your nerve, we’ll get to the
bottom of this matter, and anxious to make his order all the more
convincing he fired a shot into the air. The outcome was exactly the
opposite of what he expected. Surprised to discover that the gun was
already in other hands and that they were about to have a new leader,
the blind hoodlums stopped struggling with the women, gave up trying to
dominate them, one of the men having given up the struggle al together
because he had been strangled. It was at this point that the doctor’s
wife decided to move. Striking blows left and right, she opened a path.
Now it was the blind thugs who were calling out, who were being knocked
over and climbing all over each other, anyone there with eyes to see,
would perceive that, compared with this, the previous upheaval had been
a joke. The doctor’s wife had no desire to kill, all she wanted was to
get out as quickly as possible and, above all, not to leave a single
blind woman behind. This one probably won’t survive, she thought as she
dug the scissors into a man’s chest. Another shot was heard, Let’s go,
let’s go, said the doctor’s wife, pushing any blind women whom she
encountered ahead of her. She helped them to their feet, repeated,
Quickly, quickly, and now it was the blind accountant who was shouting
from the far end of the ward, Grab them, don’t let them escape, but it
was too late, the women were already out in the corridor, they fled,
stumbling as they went, half dressed, holding on to their rags as best
they could. Standing still at the entrance to the ward, the doctor’s
wife called out in a rage, Remember what I said the other day, that I’d
never forget his face, and from now on think about what I am telling
you, for I won’t forget your faces either, You’ll pay dearly for this
outrage, threatened the blind accountant, you and your companions and
those so-called men of yours, You neither know who I am nor where I’ve
come from, You’re from the first ward on the other side, volunteered one
of the men who had gone to summon the women, and the blind accountant
added, Your voice is unmistakable, you need only utter one word in my
presence and you’re dead, The other fellow said the same thing and now
he’s a corpse, But I’m not a blind man like him or you, when you lot
turned blind, I already knew everything about this world, You know
nothing about my blindness. You’re not blind, you can’t fool me, Perhaps
I’m the blindest of all, I’ve already killed and I’ll kill again if I
have to, You’ll die first of hunger, from today onwards there will be no
more food, even if you were all to come offering on a tray the three
holes you were born with. For each day that we’re deprived of food
because of you, one of the men here will die the moment he steps outside
this door, You won’t get away with this, Oh, yes we will, from now on we
shall be collecting the food, and you can eat what you’ve hoarded there,
Bitch, Bitches are neither men nor women, they’re bitches, and you know
now what they’re worth. Enraged, the blind accountant fired in the
direction of the door. The bullet whizzed past the heads of the blind
men without hitting anyone and lodged itself in the corridor wall. You
didn’t get me, said the doctor’s wife, and take care, if your ammunition
runs out, there are others here who would like to be leader too.</p>
<p>She moved away, took a few steps, still firm, then advanced along the
wall of the corridor, almost fainting, suddenly her legs gave way, and
she fell to the ground. Her eyes clouded over, I’m going blind, she
thought, but then realised it would not be just yet, these were only
tears blurring her vision, tears such as she had never shed in all her
life, I’ve killed a man, she said in a low voice, I wanted to kill him
and I have. She turned her head in the direction of the ward door, if
the blind men were to come now, she would be unable to defend herself.
The corridor was deserted. The woman had disappeared, the blind men,
still startled by the gunfire and even more by the corpses of their own
men, did not dare come out. Little by little she regained her strength.
Her tears continued to flow, slower and more serene, as if confronted by
something irremediable. She struggled to her feet. She had blood on her
hands and clothes, and suddenly her exhausted body told her that she was
old, Old and a murderess, she thought, but she knew that if it were
necessary, she would kill again, And when is it necessary to kill, she
asked herself as she headed in the direction of the hallway, and she
herself answered the question, When what is still alive is already dead.
She shook her head and thought, And what does that mean, words, nothing
but words. She walked on alone. She approached the door leading to the
forecourt. Between the railings of the gate she could just make out the
shadow of a soldier who was keeping guard. There are still people out
there, people who can see. The sound of footsteps behind her caused her
to tremble, It’s them, she thought and turned round rapidly with her
scissors at the ready. It was her husband. As they went past, the women
from the second ward had been shouting out what had happened on the
other side, that a woman had stabbed and killed the leader of the thugs,
that there had been shooting, the doctor did not ask them to identify
the woman, it could only be his wife, she had told the boy with the
squint that she would tell him the rest of the story later, and what
would have become of her now, probably dead as well, I’m here, she said,
and went up to him and embraced him, not noticing that she was smearing
him with blood, or noticing but unconcerned, for until now they had
shared everything. What happened, the doctor asked, they said a man was
killed, Yes, I killed him, Why, Someone had to do it, and there was no
one else, And now, Now we’re free, they know what awaits them if they
ever try to abuse us again, There’s likely to be a battle, a war, The
blind are always at war, always have been at war, Will you kill again,
If I have to, I shall never be free from this blindness, And what about
the food, We shall fetch it, I doubt whether they’ll dare to come here,
at least for the next few days they’ll be afraid the same might happen
to them, that a pair of scissors will slit their throat, We failed to
put up resistance as we should have done when they first came making
demands, Of course, we were afraid and fear isn’t always a wise
counsellor, let’s get back, for our greater safety we ought to barricade
the door of the wards by putting beds on top of beds, as they do, if
some of us have to sleep on the floor, too bad, better that than to die
of hunger.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, they asked themselves if that was not what
was about to happen to them. At first they were not surprised, from the
outset they had become used to it, there had always been delays in the
delivery of food, the blind thugs were right when they said the soldiers
were sometimes late, but then they perverted this reasoning when, in a
playful tone of voice, they affirmed that for this reason they had no
choice but to impose rationing, these are the painful obligations of
those who have to govern. On the third day when there was no longer as
much as a rind or crumb, the doctor’s wife with some companions, went
out into the forecourt and asked, Hey, why the delay, whatever happened
to our food, we haven’t eaten for the last two days. Another sergeant,
not the one from the time before, came up to the railing to declare that
the army was not responsible, that no one there was trying to take the
bread from their mouths, that military honour would never allow it, if
there was no food it was because there was no food, and all of you stay
where you are, the first one to advance knows the fate that waits for
him, the orders have not changed. This warning was enough to send them
back inside, and they conferred amongst themselves, And now what do we
do if they won’t bring us any food, They might bring some tomorrow, Or
the day after tomorrow, Or when we no longer have the strength to move,
We ought to go out, We wouldn’t even get as far as the gate, If only we
had our sight, If we had our sight we wouldn’t have landed in this hell,
I wonder what life is like out there, Perhaps those bastards might give
us something to eat if we went there to ask, after all if there’s a
shortage for us, they must be running short too, That’s why they’re
unlikely to give us anything they’ve got, And before their food runs out
we will have died of starvation, What are we to do then, They were
seated on the floor, under the yellowish light of the only lamp in the
hallway, more or less in a circle, the doctor and the doctor’s wife, the
old man with the black eyepatch, amongst the other men and women, one or
two from each ward, from the wing on the left as well as from the one on
the right, and then, this world of the blind being what it is, there
occurred what always occurs, one of the men said, All I know is that we
would never have found ourselves in this situation if their leader
hadn’t been killed, what did it matter if the women had to go there
twice a month to give these men what nature gave them to give, I ask
myself. Some found this amusing, some forced a smile, those inclined to
protest were deterred by an empty stomach, and the same man insisted,
What I’d like to know is who did the stabbing, The women who were there
at the time swear it was none of them, What we ought to do is to take
the law into our own hands and bring the culprit to justice, If we knew
who was responsible, we’d say this is the person you’re looking for, now
give us the food, If we knew who was responsible. The doctor’s wife
lowered her head and thought, He’s right, if anyone here should die of
hunger it will be my fault, but then, giving voice to the rage she could
feel welling up inside her contradicting any acceptance of
responsibility, But let these men be the first to die so that my guilt
may pay for their guilt. Then she thought, raising her eyes, And if I
were now to tell them that it was I who killed him, they would hand me
over, knowing that they would be delivering me to certain death. Whether
it was the effect of hunger or because the thought suddenly seduced her
like some abyss, her head spun as if she were in a daze, her body moved
despite herself, her mouth opened to speak, but just at that moment
someone grabbed and squeezed her arm, she looked, it was the old man
with the black eyepatch, who said, Anyone who gave himself up, I’d kill
him with my own hands, Why, people in the circle asked, Because if shame
still has any meaning in this hell where we’re expected to live and
which we’ve turned into the hell of hells, it is thanks to that person
who had the courage to go and kill the hyena in its lair, Agreed, but
shame won’t fill our plates, Whoever you may be, you’re right in what
you say, there have always been those who have filled their bellies
because they had no sense of shame, but we, who have nothing, apart from
this last shred of undeserved dignity, let us at least show that we are
still capable of fighting for what is rightfully ours, What are you
trying to say, That having started off by sending in the women and eaten
at their expense like low-life pimps, the time has now come for sending
in the men, if there are any, Explain yourself, but first tell us where
you are from, I’m from the first ward on the right-hand side, Go on
then, It’s very simple, let’s go and collect the food with our own
hands, Those men are armed, As far as we know, they have only one gun
and the ammunition will run out sooner or later, They have enough to
make sure that some of us will die, Others have died for less, I’m not
prepared to lose my life so that the rest can enjoy themselves. Would
you also be prepared to starve, if someone should lose his life so that
you might have food, the old man with the black eyepatch asked
sarcastically, and the other man gave no reply.</p>
<p>In the entrance of the door leading to the wards in the right-hand
wing, appeared a woman who had been listening out of sight. She was the
one who had received the spurt of blood in her face, the one into whose
mouth the dead man had ejaculated, the one in whose ear the doctor’s
wife had whispered, Be quiet, and now the doctor’s wife is thinking,
From here where I’m sitting in the midst of others, I cannot tell you to
be quiet, don’t give me away, but no doubt you recognise my voice, it’s
impossible that you could have forgotten it, my hand covered your mouth,
your body against mine, and I said, Be quiet, and the moment has come to
know whom I really saved, to know who you are, that is why I am about to
speak, that is why I am about to say in a loud, clear voice so that you
might accuse me, if this is your destiny and mine, I am now saying, Not
only the men will go, but also the women, we shall return to that place
where they humiliated us so that none of that humiliation may remain, so
that we might rid ourselves of it in the same way that we spat out what
they ejaculated into our mouths. She uttered these words and waited,
until the woman replied, Wherever you go, I shall go, that was what she
said. The old man with the black eyepatch smiled, it seemed a happy
smile, and perhaps it was, this is not the moment to ask him, it is much
more interesting to observe the expression of surprise on the faces of
the other blind men, as if something had passed over their heads, a
bird, a cloud, a first hesitant glimmer of light. The doctor took his
wife’s hand, then asked, Are there still people here intent on
discovering who killed that fellow, or are we agreed that the hand that
stabbed him was the hand of all of us, or to be more precise, the hand
of each one of us. No one replied. The doctor’s wife said, Let’s give
them a little longer, if, by tomorrow, the soldiers have not brought our
food, then we advance. They got up, went their separate ways, some to
the right, others to the left, imprudently they had not reflected that
some blind man from the ward of the thugs might have been listening,
fortunately the devil is not always behind the door, a saying that could
not have been more appropriate. Somewhat less appropriate was the blast
that came from the loudspeaker, recently it had spoken on certain days,
on others not at all, but always at the same time, as had been promised,
clearly there was a timer in the transmitter which at the precise moment
started up the recorded tape, the reason why it should have broken down
from time to time we are never likely to know, these are matters for the
outside world, it is in any case serious enough, insofar as it muddled
up the calendar, the so-called counting of the days, which some blind
men, natural obsessives, or lovers of order, which is a moderate form of
obsession, had tried scrupulously to follow by making little knots in a
piece of string, this was done by those who did not trust their memory,
as if they were writing a diary. Now it was the time that was out of
phase, the mechanism must have broken down, a twisted relay, some loose
soldering, let’s hope the recording will not keep going back for ever to
the beginning, that was all we needed as well as being blind and mad.
Along the corridors, through the wards, like some final and futile
warning, boomed an authoritarian voice, the Government regrets having
been forced to exercise with all urgency what it considers to be its
rightful duty, to protect the population by all possible means in this
present crisis, when something with all the appearance of an epidemic of
blindness has broken out, provisionally known as the white sickness, and
we are relying on the civic spirit and cooperation of all citizens to
stem any further contagious, assuming that we are dealing with a
contagious disease and that we are not simply witnessing a series of as
yet inexplicable coincidences. The decision to gather together in one
place all those infected, and, in adjacent but separate quarters all
those who have had any kind of contact with them, was not taken without
careful consideration. The Government is fully aware of its
responsibilities and hopes that those to whom this message is directed
will, as the upright citizens they doubtless are, also assume their
responsibilities, bearing in mind that the isolation in which they now
find themselves will represent, above any personal considerations, an
act of solidarity with the rest of the nation’s community. That said, we
ask everyone to listen attentively to the following instructions, first,
the lights will be kept on at all times, any attempt to tamper with the
switches will be useless, they don’t work, second, leaving the building
without authorisation will mean instant death, third, in each ward there
is a telephone that can be used only to requisition from outside fresh
supplies for purposes of hygiene and cleanliness, fourth, the internees
will be responsible for washing their own clothes by hand, fifth, it is
recommended that ward representatives should be elected, this is a
recommendation rather than an order, the internees must organise
themselves as they see fit, provided they comply with the aforesaid
rules and those we are about to announce, sixth, three times daily
containers with food will be deposited at the main door, on the right
and on the left, destined respectively for the patients and those
suspected of being contaminated, seventh, all the left-overs must be
burnt, and this includes not only any food, but also the containers,
plates and cutlery which are all made of combustible material, eighth,
the burning should be done in the inner courtyards of the building or in
the exercise yard, ninth, the internees are responsible for any damage
caused by these fires, tenth, in the event of a fire getting out of
control, whether accidentally or on purpose, the firemen will not
intervene, eleventh, equally, the internees cannot count on any outside
intervention should there be any outbreaks of illnesses, nor in the
event of any disorder or aggression, twelfth, in the case of death,
whatever the cause, the internees will bury the corpse in the yard
without any formalities, thirteenth, contact between the wing of the
patients and that of the people suspected of being contagious must be
made in the central hall of the building by which they entered,
fourteenth, should those suspected of being infected suddenly go blind,
they will be transferred immediately to the other wing, fifteenth, this
communication will be relayed daily at the same time for the benefit of
all new arrivals. The Government, but at that very moment the lights
went out and the loudspeaker fell silent. Unconcerned, a blind man tied
a knot in the piece of string he was holding in his hands, then he tried
to count them, the knots, the days, but he gave up, there were knots
overlapping, blind knots in a manner of speaking. The doctor’s wife said
to her husband, The lights have gone out, Some lamp that had fused, and
little wonder when they have been switched on for all this time, They’ve
all gone out, the problem must have been outside, Now you’re as blind as
the rest of us, I’ll wait until the sun comes up. She went out of the
ward, crossed the hallway, looked outside. This part of the city was in
darkness, the army’s searchlight was not working, it must have been
connected to the general network, and now, to all appearances, the power
was off.</p>
<p>The following day, some earlier, others later, because the sun does
not rise at the same time for all those who are blind, it often depends
on the keenness of hearing of each of them, men and women from the
various wards began gathering on the outer steps of the building with
the exception, needless to say, of the ward occupied by the hoodlums,
who at this hour must be having their breakfast. They were waiting for
the thud of the gate being opened, the loud screeching of hinges that
needed to be greased, the sounds that announced the arrival of their
food, then the voice of the sergeant on duty, Don’t move from where you
are, let no one approach, the dragging of soldiers’ feet, the dull sound
of the containers being dumped on the ground, the hasty retreat, once
more the creaking of the gate, and finally the authorisation, Now you
can come out. They waited until it was almost midday and midday became
the afternoon. No one, not even the doctor’s wife, wanted to ask about
the food. So long as they did not ask the question they would not hear
the dreaded no, and so long as it was not spoken they would go on hoping
to hear words like these, It’s coming, it’s coming, be patient, put up
with your hunger for just a little longer. Some, however much they
wanted, could not stand it any longer, they fainted there and then as if
they had suddenly fallen asleep, fortunately the doctor’s wife was there
to come to the rescue, it was incredible how this woman managed to
notice everything that was hap pening, she must be endowed with a sixth
sense, some sort of a vision without eyes, thanks to which those
miserable wretches did not remain there to broil in the sun, they were
carried indoors at once, and with time, water and gentle slaps on the
face, all of them eventually came round. But there was no point in
counting on the latter for the war, they would not even be able to grab
a she-cat by the tail, an old-fashioned expression which never explained
for what extraordinary reason a she-cat should be easier to deal with
than a tom-cat. Finally the old man with the black eyepatch said, The
food hasn’t come, the food won’t come, let’s go and get our food. They
got up, God knows how, and went to assemble in the ward furthest away
from the stronghold of the hoodlums, rather than have any repetition of
the imprudence of the other day. From there they sent spies to the other
wing, blind inmates who lived there and were more familiar with the
surroundings, At the first suspicious movement, come and warn us. The
doctor’s wife went with them and came back with some disheartening
information, They have barricaded the entrance with four beds stacked
one on top of the other, How did you know there were four, someone
asked, That wasn’t difficult, I felt them, Did no one realise you were
there, I don’t think so, What are we going to do, Let’s go, the old man
with the black eyepatch suggested once more, let’s stick to what was
decided, it’s either that or we’re condemned to a slow death. Some will
die sooner if we go there, said the first blind man, Anyone who is going
to die is already dead and does not know it, That we’re going to die is
something we know from the moment we are born, That’s why, in some ways,
it’s as if we were born dead, That’s enough of your foolish talk, said
the girl with the dark glasses, I cannot go there alone, but if we are
now going to go back on what was agreed, then I’m simply going to lie on
my bed and allow myself to die, Only those whose days are numbered will
die, no one else, said the doctor, and raising his voice, he asked,
Those who are determined to go, raise their hand, this is what happens
to those who do not think twice before opening their mouth to speak,
what was the point in asking them to raise their hands if there was no
one there to count them, or so it was generally believed, and then say,
Thirteen, in which case a new discussion would almost certainly start up
to establish what, in the light of logic, would be more correct, whether
to ask for another volunteer to avoid that unlucky number, or to avoid
it by default, drawing lots to decide who should drop out. Some had
raised their hand with little conviction, with a gesture that betrayed
hesitation and doubt, whether because aware of the danger to which they
were about to expose themselves, or because they realised the absurdity
of the order. The doctor laughed, How ridiculous, to ask you to put up
your hands, let’s proceed in another manner, let those who cannot or do
not wish to go withdraw, the rest stay behind to agree upon the action
to be taken. There were stirrings, footsteps, murmurs, sighs, little by
little, the weak and nervous dropped out, the doctor’s idea had been as
excellent as it was generous, in this way it will be less easy to know
who had remained and who was no longer there. The doctor’s wife counted
those who had remained, they were seventeen, counting herself and her
husband. From the first ward on the right hand side, there was the old
man with the black eye-patch, the pharmacist’s assistant, the girl with
dark glasses, and all the volunteers from the other wards were men with
the exception of that woman who had said, Wherever you go, I shall go,
she is here too. They lined up along the passageway, the doctor counted
them, Seventeen, we’re seventeen, That’s not very many, remarked the
pharmacist’s assistant, we’ll never manage. The front line of attack, if
I may use a rather military term, will have to be a narrow one, said the
old man with the black eye-patch, we have to be able to fit through a
door, I’m convinced it would only complicate matters if there were more
of us, They’d shoot the lot of us, agreed another, and everyone seemed
pleased that in the end they were few.</p>
<p>Their arms we are already familiar with, bars taken from the beds,
which might serve just as well as a crowbar or a lance, according to
whether the sappers or assault troops were going into battle. The old
man with the black eyepatch, who had clearly learned something about
tactics in his youth, suggested that everyone should stay together,
facing in the same direction, since this was the only way to avoid
attacking each other, and that they should advance in absolute silence,
so that the attack might benefit from the element of surprise, Let’s
take off our shoes, he suggested. Then it’s going to be difficult for
each of us to find our own shoes, someone said, and another commented,
Any shoes left over will truly be dead men’s shoes, with the difference
that in this case, at least, there will always be someone to step into
them, What is all this talk about dead men’s shoes, It’s a saying, to
wait for dead men’s shoes means to wait for nothing at all, Why, Because
the shoes the dead were buried in were made of cardboard, they served
their purpose, souls have no feet, as far as we know, And there’s
another point, interrupted the old man with the black eyepatch, when we
get there, six of us, the six who are feeling bravest, will shove the
beds inside as hard as they can, so that all of us may enter, In that
case, we’ll have to lay down our arms, I don’t think that will be
necessary, they might even help, if used upright. He paused, then said,
with a sombre note in his voice, Above all, we must not split up, if we
do we’re as good as dead, And what about the women, said the girl with
dark glasses, don’t forget the women, Are you going as well, asked the
old man with the black eyepatch, I’d rather you didn’t, And why not, I’d
like to know, You’re very young, In this place, age is of no account,
nor sex, therefore don’t forget the women, No, I won’t forget, the voice
in which the old man with the black eyepatch spoke these words appeared
to come from another dialogue, those that follow were already in their
place, On the contrary, if only one of you women could see what we
cannot see, take us along the right path, with the tip of our metal bars
at the throats of these ruffians, as accurately as that other woman did,
That would be asking too much, we can’t easily repeat what we’ve done
once already, besides, who’s to say that she didn’t die there and then,
there has been no news of her, the doctor’s wife reminded them, Women
are born again in one another, the respectable are reborn as whores,
whores are reborn as respectable women, said the girl with dark glasses.
This was followed by a long silence, for the women everything had been
said, the men would have to find the words, and they knew already that
they would be incapable of doing so.</p>
<p>They filed out, the six braver ones in front as had been agreed,
amongst them was the doctor and the pharmacist’s assistant, then came
the others, each armed with a metal rod from his bed, a brigade of
squalid, ragged lancers, as they crossed the hallway one of them dropped
his weapon, which made a deafening sound on the tiled floor like a blast
of gunfire, if the hoodlums were to hear the noise and get wind of what
we’re up to, then we’re lost. Without telling anyone, not even her
husband, the doctor’s wife ran ahead, looked along the corridor, then
very slowly, keeping close to the wall, she gradually drew nearer to the
entrance of the ward, there she listened attentively, the voices within
did not sound alarmed. She brought back this information without delay
and the advance recommenced. Apart from the slowness and the silence
with which the army moved, the occupants of the two wards that were
located before the stronghold of the hoodlums, aware of what was about
to happen, gathered at the doors so as not to miss the imminent clamour
of battle, and some of those more on edge, excited by the smell of
gunpowder about to be lit, decided at the last minute to accompany the
group, a few went back to arm themselves, they were no longer seventeen,
they had at least doubled in number, the reinforcements would certainly
displease the old man with the black eyepatch, but he was never to know
that he was commanding two regiments instead of one. Through the few
windows that looked on to the inner courtyard entered the last glimmer
of light, grey, moribund, as it rapidly faded, already slipping away
into the deep black well of the night ahead. Apart from the inconsolable
sadness caused by the blindness from which they inexplicably continued
to suffer, the blind internees, this at least was in their favour, were
spared any fits of depression produced by these and other similar
atmospheric changes, proven to be the cause of innumerable acts of
despair in the remote past when people had eyes to see. When they
reached the door of that cursed ward, it was already so dark that the
doctor’s wife failed to notice that there were not four but eight beds
forming a barrier, doubled in number in the meantime like the
assailants, however with more serious immediate consequences for the
latter, as will soon be confirmed. The voice of the old man with the
black eyepatch let out a cry, it was the order, he did not remember the
usual expression, Charge, or perhaps he did, but it would have struck
him as ridiculous to treat with such military consideration, a barrier
of filthy beds, full of fleas and bugs, their mattresses rotted from
sweat and urine, the blankets like rags, no longer grey, but all the
colours that disgust might wear, this the doctor’s wife already knew,
not that she could see it now, since she had not even noticed the
reinforced barricade. The blind inmates advanced like archangels
surrounded by their own splendour, they thudded into the obstacle with
their weapons upright as they had been instructed, but the beds did not
move, no doubt the strength of this brave vanguard was not much greater
than that of the weaklings who came behind and by now could scarcely
hold their lances, like someone who carried a cross on his back and now
has to wait to be raised up on it. The silence had disappeared, those
outside were shouting, those inside started shouting, probably no one
has noticed to this day how absolutely terrible are the cries of the
blind, they appear to be shouting for no good reason, we want to tell
them to be quiet and then end up shouting ourselves, all that’s wanting
is for us to be blind too, but that day will come. This then was the
situation, some shouting as they attacked, others shouting as they
defended themselves, while those on the outside, desperate at not having
been able to move the beds, flung down their weapons willy-nilly and,
all of them at once, at least those who managed to squeeze into the
space in the doorway, and those who couldn’t fit in pressed behind those
in front, they started pushing and pushing and it looked as if they
might succeed, the beds had even moved a little, when suddenly, without
prior warning or threat, three shots rang out, it was the blind
accountant aiming low. Two of the assailants fell, wounded, the others
quickly retreated in disarray, they tripped on the metal rods and fell,
as if demented the walls of the corridor multiplied their shouts,
shouting was coming from the other wards too. It was now almost
pitch-black, it was impossible to know who had been hit by the bullets,
obviously one could ask from afar, Who are you, but it did not seem
appropriate, the wounded must be treated with respect and consideration,
we must approach them gently, place our hand on their forehead, unless
that is where the bullet unfortunately happened to strike, then we must
ask them in a low voice how they are feeling, assure them it is not
serious, the stretcher-bearers are already on the way, and finally give
them some water, but only if they are not wounded in the stomach, as is
expressly recommended in the first-aid handbook. What shall we do now,
asked the doctor’s wife, there are two casualties lying there on the
ground. No one asked her how she knew there were two of them, after all,
there had been three shots, without reckoning with the effect of the
ricochets, if there had been any. We must go and look for them, said the
doctor, The risk is great, observed the old man with the black eyepatch
despondently, who had seen that his assault tactics had resulted in
disaster, if they suspect there are people here they’ll start firing
again, he paused and added sighing, But we must go there, speaking for
myself, I’m ready, I’m going too, said the doctor’s wife, there will be
less danger if we crawl, the important thing is to find them quickly,
before those inside there have time to react, I’m going too, said the
woman who had declared the other day, Wherever you go, I go, of the many
that were there no one thought to say that it was very easy to check who
was wounded, correction, wounded or dead, for the moment no one yet
knows, it was enough that they should all start saying, I’m going, I’m
not going, those who remained silent were the latter.</p>
<p>And so the four volunteers began crawling, the two women in the
middle, a man on either side as it happened, they were not acting out of
male courtesy or some gentlemanly instinct so that the women should be
protected, the truth is that everything will depend on the angle of the
shot, if the blind accountant should fire again. After all, perhaps
nothing will happen, the old man with the black eyepatch had come up
with an idea before they went, possibly better than the earlier ones,
that these companions here should start to talk at the top of their
voices, even to shout, besides they had every reason to do so, so that
they might drown the inevitable noise of their comings and goings, and
also whatever might happen in the meantime, God knows what. In a few
minutes, the rescuers reached their destination, they knew it before
even coming into contact with the bodies, the blood over which they were
crawling was like a messenger come to tell them, I was life, behind me
there is nothing, My God, thought the doctor’s wife, all this blood, and
it was true, a thick pool, their hands and clothing stuck to the ground
as if the floorboards and floor tiles were covered in glue. The doctor’s
wife raised herself on her elbows and continued to advance, the others
had done the same. Stretching out their arms, they finally reached the
corpses. Their companions back there continued to make as much noise as
they could, and now sounded like professional mourners in a trance. The
hands of the doctor’s wife and of the old man with the black eyepatch
grabbed the ankles of one of the casualties, in their turn the doctor
and the other woman had grabbed an arm and leg of the other wounded man,
now they were trying to drag them away out of the firing line. It was
not easy, to achieve this they had to raise themselves up a little, to
go on all fours, it was the only way of putting to good use the little
strength they still possessed. The shot rang out, but this time did not
hit anyone. The overwhelming terror did not make them flee, on the
contrary, it helped them to summon that last ounce of energy that was
needed. An instant later they were already out of danger, they got as
close as they could to the wall on the side where the ward door was
situated, only a stray bullet could possibly reach them, but it was
doubtful that the blind accountant was skilled in ballistics, even
elementary ones such as these. They tried to lift the bodies but gave
up. Because of their weight they could only drag them, and with them,
half congealed, trailed the blood already spilled as if spread by a
roller, and the remaining blood, still fresh, that continued to flow
from the wounds. Who are they, asked those who were waiting, How are we
to know if we cannot see, said the old man with the black eyepatch, We
can’t stay here, said someone, if they decide to launch an attack we’ll
have more than two casualties, remarked another, Or corpses, said the
doctor, at least I cannot feel their pulse. Like an army in retreat,
they carried the corpses along the corridor, on reaching the hallway
they came to a halt, and one would have said they had decided to camp
there, but the truth of the matter was different, what had happened was
that they were drained of all energy, I’m staying right here, I can’t go
any further. It is time to acknowledge that it must seem surprising that
the blind hoodlums, previously so overbearing and aggressive, revelling
in their own easy cruelty, now only defend themselves, raise barricades
and fire from inside there at will, as if they were afraid to go out and
fight in open territory, face to face, eye to eye. Like everything else
in this life, this too, has its explanation, which is that after the
tragic death of their first leader, all spirit of discipline or sense of
obedience had gone in the ward, the serious error on the part of the
blind accountant was to have thought that it was enough to take
possession of the gun in order to usurp power, but the result was
exactly the opposite, each time he fires, the shot backfires, in other
words, with each shot fired, he loses a little more authority, so let’s
see what happens when he runs out of ammunition. Just as the habit does
not make the monk, the sceptre does not make the king, this is a fact we
should never forget, and if it is true that the royal sceptre is now
held by the blind accountant, one is tempted to say that the king,
although dead, although buried in his own ward, and badly, barely three
feet under the ground, continues to be remembered, at least he makes his
powerful presence felt by the stench. Meanwhile, the moon appeared.
Through the door of the hallway that looks out on to the outer yard
enters a diffused light that gradually becomes brighter, the bodies that
are on the ground, two of them dead, the others still alive, slowly
begin gaining volume, shape, characteristics, features, all the weight
of a horror without a name, then the doctor’s wife understood that there
was no sense, if there ever had been any, in going on pretending to be
blind, it is clear that here no one can be saved, blindness is also
this, to live in a world where all hope is gone. She could tell in the
meantime who was dead, this is the pharmacist’s assistant, this is the
fellow who said the blind hoodlums would shoot at random, they were both
right after a fashion, and don’t bother asking me how I know who they
are, the answer is simple, I can see. Some of those who were present
already knew as much and had remained silent, others had been suspicious
for some time and now saw their suspicions confirmed, the surprise of
the others was unexpected, and yet, on reflection, perhaps we should not
be surprised, at another time the revelation would have caused much
consternation, uncontrolled excitement, how fortunate for you, how did
you manage to escape this universal disaster, what is the name of the
drops you put in your eyes, give me your doctor’s address, help me to
get out of this prison, by now it came to the same thing, in death,
blindness is the same for all. What they could not do was to remain
there, defenceless, even the metal bars from their beds had been left
behind, their fists would serve for nothing. Guided by the doctor’s
wife, they dragged the corpses out on to the forecourt, and there they
left them in the moonlight, under the planet’s milky whiteness, white on
the outside, black at last on the inside. Let’s return to the wards,
said the old man with the black eyepatch, we’ll see later on what can be
organised. This is what he said, and they were mad words that no one
heeded. They did not divide up according to where they had come from,
they met up and recognised each other on the way, some heading for the
wing on the left, others for the wing on the right, the doctor’s wife
had been accompanied this far by that woman who had said, Wherever you
go, I go, this was not the idea she now carried in her head, quite the
contrary, but she did not want to discuss it, vows are not always
fulfilled, sometimes out of weakness, at other times because of some
superior force with which we had not reckoned.</p>
<p>An hour passed, the moon came up, hunger and terror hold sleep at
bay, in the wards everyone is awake. But these are not the only reasons.
Whether because of the excitement of the recent battle, even though so
disastrously lost, or because of something indefinable in the air, the
blind internees are restless. No one dares go out into the corridors,
but the interior of each ward is like a beehive inhabited by drones,
buzzing insects, as everyone knows, little given to order and method,
there is no evidence that they have ever done anything in their lives or
preoccupied themselves in the slightest with the future, even though in
the case of the blind, unhappy creatures, it would be unjust to accuse
them of being exploiters and parasites, exploiters of what crumb,
parasites of what refreshment, one has to be careful with comparisons,
in case they should turn out to be frivolous. However, there is no rule
without an exception, and this was not lacking here, in the person of a
woman who entered the ward, the second one on the right-hand side, and
at once began rummaging through her rags until she found a tiny object
which she pressed in the palm of her hand, as if anxious to conceal it
from the prying eyes of others, old habits die hard, even when that
moment comes when we thought they were lost for ever. Here, where it
ought to have been one for all and all for one, we witnessed how the
strong cruelly took the bread from the mouths of the weak, and now this
woman, remembering that she had brought a cigarette lighter in her
hand-luggage, unless she had lost it in all the upheaval, searched for
it anxiously and is now furtively hiding it, as if her survival depended
on it, she does not think that perhaps one of these companions in
misfortune might have one last cigarette on them, and cannot smoke it
because they do not have that tiny essential flame. Nor would there be
time now to ask for a light. The woman has gone out without saying a
word, no farewell, no goodbye, she makes her way along the deserted
corridor, passes right by the door of the first ward, no one inside
there noticed her pass, she crosses the hallway, the descending moon
traced and painted a vat of milk on the floor tiles, now the woman is in
the other wing, once more a corridor, her destination lies at the far
end, in a straight line, she cannot go wrong. Besides, she can hear
voices summoning her, figuratively speaking, what she can hear is the
rumpus being made by the hoodlums in the last ward, they are celebrating
their victory, eating and drinking to their heart’s content, ignore the
deliberate exaggeration, let us not forget that everything is relative
in life, they eat and drink simply what is to hand, and long may it
last, how the others would love to partake of the feast, but they
cannot, between them and the plate there is a barricade of eight beds
and a loaded gun. The woman is on her knees at the entrance to the ward,
right up against the beds, she slowly pulls the covers off, then gets to
her feet, she does the same with the bed on top, then with the third
one, her arm cannot reach the fourth, no matter, the fuses are ready,
now it is only a question of setting them alight. She can still remember
how to regulate the lighter in order to produce a long flame, she got
it, a tiny dagger of light, as bright as the sharp point of a pair of
scissors. She starts with the bed on top, the flame laboriously licks
the filthy bedclothes, then it finally catches fire, now the bed in the
middle, now the bed below, the woman caught the smell of her own singed
hair, she must be careful, she is the one who has to set the pyre
alight, not the one who must die, she can hear the cries of the hoodlums
within, at that moment it suddenly occurred to her, Suppose they have
water and manage to put out the flames, in desperation she got under the
first bed, ran the lighter along the mattress, here, there, then
suddenly the flames multiplied, transformed themselves into one great
curtain of fire, a spurt of water passed through them, splashed on to
the woman, but in vain, her own body was already feeding the bonfire.
What is it like in there, no one can risk entering, but our imag ination
must serve for something, the fire quickly spreads from bed to bed, as
if wanting to set all of them alight at the same time, and it succeeds,
the hoodlums wasted indiscriminately and to no avail the little water
they still had, now they are trying to reach the windows, unsteadily
they climb on to the headrests of the beds which the fire has still not
reached, but suddenly the fire is there, they slip, fall, with the
intensity of the heat the window-panes begin to crack, to shatter, the
fresh air comes whistling in and fans the flames, ah, yes, they are not
forgotten, the cries of rage and fear, the howls of pain and agony,
there they have been mentioned, note, in any case, that they will
gradually die away, the woman with the cigarette lighter, for example,
has been silent for some time.</p>
<p>By this time the other blind inmates are fleeing in terror towards
the smoke-filled corridors, Fire, fire, they are shouting, and here we
may observe in the flesh how badly planned and organised these human
communities in orphanages, hospitals and mental asylums have been, note
how each bed, in itself, with its framework of pointed metal bars, can
be transformed into a lethal trap, look at the terrible consequences of
having only one door to wards occupied by forty people, not counting
those asleep on the floor, if the fire gets there first and blocks their
exit, no one will escape. Fortunately, as human history has shown, it is
not unusual for good to come of evil, less is said about the evil that
can come out of good, such are the contradictions of this world of ours,
some warrant more consideration than others, in this instance the good
was precisely the fact that the wards have only one door, thanks to this
factor, the fire that burnt the hoodlums tarried there for quite a
while, if the confusion does not get any worse, perhaps we will not have
to lament the loss of other lives. Obviously, many of these blind
inmates are being trampled under foot, pushed, jostled, this is the
effect of panic, a natural effect, you could say that animal nature is
like this, plant life would behave in exactly the same way, too, if it
did not have all those roots to hold it in the ground, and how nice it
would be to see the trees of the forest fleeing the flames. The
protection afforded by the inner part of the yard was fully exploited by
the blind inmates who had the idea of opening the existing windows in
the corridors looking on to it. They jumped, stumbled, fell, they weep
and cry out, but for now they are safe, let us hope that once the fire
causes the roof to cave in and launches a whirlwind of flames and
burning embers into the sky and the wind, it will forget to spread to
the tree tops. In the other wing the panic is much the same, a blind man
only has to smell smoke to imagine at once that the flames are right by
him, which does not happen to be true, soon the corridor was crammed
with people, unless someone imposes some order here, the situation will
be disastrous. At a certain point, someone remembers that the doctor’s
wife still has her eyesight, where is she, people ask, she can tell us
what is happening, where we should go, where is she, I’m here, I’ve only
just managed to get out of the ward, the boy with the squint was to
blame because no one knew where he had got to, now he’s here with me and
I’m holding him firmly by the hand, they would have to pull off my arm
before I’d let go of him, with my other hand I’m holding my husband’s
hand, and then comes the girl with dark glasses, and then the old man
with the black eyepatch, where there is the one there is the other, and
then the first blind man, and then his wife, all together, as compressed
as a pine-cone, which, I very much hope, will not open even in this
heat. Meanwhile, a number of blind inmates from here had followed the
example of those in the other wing, they jumped into the inner yard,
they cannot see that the greater part of the building on the other side
is already one great bonfire, but they can feel on their faces and hands
the blast of heat coming from there, for the moment the roof is still
holding up, the leaves on the trees are slowly curling. Then someone
shouted, What are we doing here, why don’t we get out, the reply, coming
from amidst this sea of heads, needed only four words, The soldiers are
there, but the old man with the black eyepatch said, Better to be shot
than burnt to death, it sounded like the voice of experience, therefore
perhaps he was not really the person speaking, perhaps through his mouth
the woman with the cigarette lighter had spoken, she who had not had the
good fortune to be struck by the last bullet fired by the blind
accountant. Then the doctor’s wife said, Let me pass, I’ll speak to the
soldiers, they cannot leave us to die like this, soldiers too have
feelings. Thanks to the hope that the soldiers might indeed have
feelings, a narrow gap opened up, through which the doctor’s wife
advanced with considerable effort, taking her group with her. The smoke
clouded her vision, soon she would be as blind as the others. It was
almost impossible to enter the hallway. The doors opening on to the yard
had been broken down, the blind inmates who had taken refuge there
quickly realised the place was unsafe, they wanted to get out, pushed
with all their might, but those on the other side resisted, held out as
best they could, for the moment their greater fear was that the soldiers
might suddenly appear, but as their strength gave out and the fire
spread nearer, the old man with the black eyepatch was proved to be
right, it would be preferable to die by a bullet. There was not long to
wait, the doctor’s wife had finally managed to get out on to the porch,
she was practically half naked and with both her hands occupied she
could scarcely fight off those who wanted to join her small group as it
advanced, to catch, in a manner of speaking, the moving train, the
soldiers would be goggle-eyed when they saw her appear before them with
her breasts half exposed. It was no longer the moonlight that was
illuminating the wide empty space that extended as far as the gate, but
the harsh glare of the blaze. The doctor’s wife shouted, Please, for
your own peace of mind, let us out, do not shoot. No reply came from
over there. The searchlight was still extinguished, nothing could be
seen to move. Nervously, the doctor’s wife went down two steps, What’s
going on, asked her husband, but she did not reply, could not believe
her eyes. She descended the remaining steps, walked in the direction of
the gate, still dragging behind her the boy with the squint, her husband
and company, there was no doubt about it, the soldiers had gone, or been
taken away, they too stricken by blindness, everyone finally blind.</p>
<p>Then, to simplify matters, everything happened at once, the doctor’s
wife announced in a loud voice that they were free, the roof of the
right wing collapsed with a terrifying crash, sending out flames on all
sides, the blind inmates rushed into the yard, shouting at the top of
their voices, some did not make it, they remained inside, crushed
against the walls, others were trampled under foot and transformed into
a formless, bloody mass, the fire that has suddenly spread will soon
reduce all of this to ashes. The gate is wide open, the madmen
escape.</p>
