<h4 id="section">6</h4>
<p>We must see if there’s a spade or shovel or whatever around,
something that can be used to dig, said the doctor. It was morning, with
much effort they had brought the corpse into the inner courtyard, placed
it on the ground amongst the litter and the dead leaves from the trees.
Now they had to bury it. Only the doctor’s wife knew the hideous state
of the dead man’s body, the face and skull blown to smithereens by the
gunshots, three holes where bullets had penetrated the neck and the
region of the breastbone. She also knew that in the entire building
there was nothing that could be used to dig a grave. She had searched
the parts of the asylum to which they had been confined and had found
nothing apart from an iron bar. It would help but was not enough. And
through the closed windows of the corridor that ran the full length of
the wing reserved for those suspected of being infected, lower down on
this side of the wall, she had seen the terrified faces of the people
awaiting their turn, that inevitable moment when they would have to say
to the others, I’ve gone blind, or when, if they were to try to conceal
what had happened, some clumsy gesture might betray them, a movement of
their head in search of shade, an unjustified stumble into someone
sighted. All this the doctor also knew, what he had said was part of the
deception they had both concocted, so that now his wife could say, And
suppose we were to ask the soldiers to throw a shovel over the wall. A
good idea, let’s try, and everyone was agreed, only the girl with dark
glasses expressed no opinion about this question of finding a spade or
shovel, the only sounds coming from her meanwhile were tears and
wailing, It was my fault, she sobbed, and it was true, no one could deny
it, but it is also true, if this brings her any consolation, that if,
before every action, we were to begin by weighing up the consequences,
thinking about them in earnest, first the immediate consequences, then
the probable, then the possible, then the imaginable ones, we should
never move beyond the point where our first thought brought us to a
halt. The good and the evil resulting from our words and deeds go on
apportioning themselves, one assumes in a reasonably uniform and
balanced way, throughout all the days to follow, including those endless
days, when we shall not be here to find out, to congratulate ourselves
or ask for pardon, indeed there are those who claim that this is the
much-talked-of immortality, Possibly, but this man is dead and must be
buried. Therefore the doctor and his wife went off to parley, the
disconsolate girl with dark glasses said she was coming with them.
Pricked by her conscience. No sooner did they appear at the main
entrance than a soldier shouted, Halt, and as if afraid that this verbal
command, however vigorous, might not be heeded, he fired into the air.
Terrified, they retreated into the shadows of the hallway, behind the
thick wooden panels of the open door. Then the doctor’s wife advanced
alone, from where she was standing she could watch the soldier’s
movements and take refuge in time, if necessary. We have nothing with
which to bury the dead man, she said, we need a spade. At the main gate,
but on the other side from where the blind man had fallen, another
soldier appeared. He was a sergeant, but not the same one as before,
What do you want, he shouted, We need a shovel or spade. There is no
such thing here, on your way. We must bury the corpse, Don’t bother
about any burial, leave it there to rot, If we simply leave it lying
there, the air will be infected, Then let it be infected and much good
may it do you, Air circulates and moves around as much here as there.
The relevance of her argument forced the soldier to reflect. He had come
to replace the other sergeant, who had gone blind and been taken without
delay to the quarters where the sick belonging to the army were
interned. Needless to say, the air force and navy also had their own
installations, but less extensive or important, the personnel of both
forces being less numerous. The woman is right, reflected the sergeant,
in a situation like this there is no doubt that one cannot be careful
enough. As a safety measure, two soldiers equipped with gas masks, had
already poured two large bottles of ammonia over the pool of blood, and
the lingering fumes still brought tears to the soldiers’ eyes and a
stinging sensation to their throats and nostrils. The sergeant finally
declared. I’ll see what can be done, And what about our food, asked the
doctor’s wife, taking advantage of this opportunity to remind him, The
food still hasn’t arrived, In our wing alone there are more than fifty
people, we’re hungry, what you’re sending us simply isn’t enough,
Supplying food is not the army’s responsibility, Someone ought to be
dealing with this problem, the Government undertook to feed us, Get back
inside, I don’t want to see anyone at this door, What about the spade,
the doctor’s wife insisted, but the sergeant had already gone. It was
mid-morning when a voice came over the loudspeaker in the ward,
Attention, attention, the internees brightened up, they thought this was
an announcement about their food, but no, it was about the spade,
Someone should come and fetch it, but not in a group, one person only
should come forward, I’ll go, for I’ve already spoken to them, said the
doctor’s wife. The moment she went through the main entrance door, she
saw the spade. From the position and distance to where it had landed,
closer to the gate than the steps, it must have been thrown over the
fence, I mustn’t forget that I’m supposed to be blind, the doctor’s wife
thought, Where is it, she asked, Go down the stairs and I’ll guide you,
replied the sergeant, you’re doing fine, now keep going in the same
direction, like so, like so, stop, turn slightly to the right, no, to
the left, less, less than that, now forward, so long as you keep going,
you’ll come right up against it, shit, I told you not to change
direction, cold, cold, you’re getting warmer again, warmer still, right,
now take a half turn and I’ll guide you from there, I don’t want you
going round and round in circles and ending up at the gate, Don’t you
worry, she thought, from here I’ll make straight for the door, after
all, what does it matter, even if you were to suspect that I’m not
blind, what do I care, you won’t be coming in here to take me away. She
slung the spade over her shoulder like a gravedigger on his way to work,
and walked in the direction of the door without faltering for a moment,
Did you see that, sergeant, exclaimed one of the soldiers, you would
think she could see. The blind learn quickly how to find their way
around, the sergeant explained confidently.</p>
<p>It was hard work digging a grave. The soil was hard, trampled down,
there were tree roots just below the surface. The taxi-driver, the two
policemen and the first blind man took it in turns to dig. Confronted by
death, what is expected of nature is that rancour should lose its force
and poison, it is true that people say that past hatreds die hard, and
of this there is ample proof in literature and life, but the feeling
here, deep down, as it were, was not hatred and, in no sense old, for
how does the theft of a car compare with the life of the man who stole
it, and especially given the miserable state of his corpse, for one does
not need eyes to know that this face has neither nose nor mouth. They
were unable to dig any deeper than about three feet. Had the dead man
been fat, his belly would have been sticking out above ground level, but
the thief was skinny, a real bag of bones, even skinnier after the
fasting of recent days, the grave was big enough for two corpses his
size. There were no prayers for the dead. We could have put a cross
there, the girl with dark glasses reminded them, she spoke from remorse,
but as far as anyone there was aware while alive, the deceased had never
given a thought to God or religion, best to say nothing, if any other
attitude is justified in the face of death, besides, bear in mind that
making a cross is much less easy than it may seem, not to mention the
little time it would last with all these blind people around who cannot
see where they are treading. They returned to the ward. In the busier
places, so long as it is not completely open, like the yard, the blind
no longer lose their way, with one arm held out in front and several
fingers moving like the antennae of insects, they can find their way
everywhere, it is even probable that in the more gifted of the blind
there soon develops what is referred to as frontal vision. Take the
doctor’s wife, for example, it is quite extraordinary how she manages to
get around and orient herself through this veritable maze of rooms,
nooks and corridors, how she knows precisely where to turn the corner,
how she can come to a halt before a door and open it without a moment’s
hesitation, how she has no need to count the beds before reaching her
own. At this moment she is seated on her husband’s bed, she is talking
to him, as usual in a low voice, one can see these are educated people,
and they always have something to say to each other, they are not like
the other married couple, the first blind man and his wife, after those
first emotional moments on being reunited, they have scarcely spoken, in
all probability, their present unhappiness outweighs their past love,
with time they will get used to this situation. The one person who is
forever complaining of feeling hungry is the boy with the squint,
despite the fact that the girl with the dark glasses has practically
taken the food from her own mouth to give him. Many hours have passed
since he last asked about his mummy, but no doubt he will start to miss
her again after having eaten, when his body finds itself released from
the brute selfishness that stems from the simple, but pressing need to
sustain itself. Whether because of what happened early that morning, or
for reasons beyond our ken, the sad truth is that no containers were
delivered at breakfast time. It is nearly time for lunch, almost one
o’clock on the watch the doctor’s wife has just furtively consulted,
therefore it is not surprising that the impatience of their gastric
juices has driven some of the blind internees, both from this wing and
from the other, to go and wait in the hallway for the food to arrive,
and this for two excellent reasons, the public one, on the part of some,
because in this way they would gain time, the private one, on the part
of others, because, as everyone knows, first come first served. In all,
there were about ten blind internees listening for the noise of the
outer gate when it was opened, for the footsteps of the soldiers who
would deliver those blessed containers. In their turn, fearful of
suddenly being stricken by blindness if they were to come into close
contact with the blind waiting in the hallway, the contaminated
internees from the left wing dare not leave, but several of them are
peering through a gap in the door, anxiously awaiting their turn. Time
passed. Tired of waiting, some of the blind internees had sat down on
the ground, later two or three of them returned to their wards. Shortly
afterwards, the unmistakable metallic creaking of the gate could be
heard. In their excitement, the blind internees, pushing each other,
began moving in the direction where, judging from the sounds outside,
they imagined the door to be, but suddenly, overcome by a vague sense of
disquiet that they would not have time to define or explain, they came
to a halt and retreated in confusion, while the footsteps of the
soldiers bringing their food and those of the armed escort accompanying
them could already be heard quite clearly.</p>
<p>Still suffering from the shock of the tragic episode of the previous
night, the soldiers who delivered the containers had agreed that they
would not leave them within reach of the doors leading to the wings, as
they had more or less done before, they would just dump them in the
hallway, and retreat. Let them sort it out for themselves. The dazzle of
the strong light from outside and the abrupt transition into the shadows
of the hallway prevented them at first from seeing the group of blind
internees. But they soon spotted them. Howling in terror, they dropped
the containers on the ground and fled like madmen straight out of the
door. The two soldiers forming the escort, who were waiting outside,
reacted admirably in the face of danger. Mastering, God alone knows how
and why, their legitimate fear, they advanced to the threshold of the
door and emptied their magazines. The blind internees fell one on top of
the other, and, as they fell, their bodies were still being riddled with
bullets which was a sheer waste of ammunition, it all happened so
incredibly slowly, one body, then another, it seemed they would never
stop falling, as you sometimes see in films and on television. If we are
still in an age when a soldier has to account for the bullets fired,
they will swear on the flag that they acted in legitimate defence, as
well as in defence of their unarmed comrades who were on a humanitarian
mission and suddenly found themselves threatened and outnumbered by a
group of blind internees. In a mad rush they retreated to the gate,
covered by the rifles which the soldiers on patrol were pointing
unsteadily between the railings as if the blind internees who had
survived, were about to make a retaliatory attack. His face drained of
colour, one of the soldiers who had fired, said nervously, You won’t get
me going back in there at any price. From one moment to the next, on
this same day, when evening was falling, at the hour of changing guard,
he became one more blind man among the other blind men, what saved him
was that he belonged to the army, otherwise he would have remained there
along with the blind internees, the companions of those whom he had shot
dead, and God knows what they might have done to him. The sergeant’s
only comment was, It would have been better to let them die of hunger,
when the beast dies, the poison dies with it. As we know, others had
often said and thought the same, happily, some precious remnant of
concern for humanity prompted him to add, From now on, we shall leave
the containers at the halfway point, let them come and fetch them, we’ll
keep them under surveillance, and at the slightest suspicious movement,
we fire. He headed for the command post, switched on the microphone and,
putting the words together as best he could, calling to mind words he
remembered hearing on vaguely comparable occasions, he announced, The
army regrets having been forced to repress with weapons a seditious
movement responsible for creating a situation of imminent risk, for
which the army was neither directly nor indirectly to blame, and you are
advised that from now on the internees will collect their food outside
the building, and will suffer the consequences should there be any
attempt to repeat the disruption that took place now and last night. He
paused, uncertain how he should finish, he had forgotten his own words,
he certainly had them, but could only repeat, We were not to blame, we
were not to blame.</p>
<p>Inside the building, the blast of gunfire deafeningly echoing in the
confined space of the hallway, had caused the utmost panic. At first it
was thought that the soldiers were about to burst into the wards and
shoot everything in sight, that the Government had changed its tactics,
had opted for the wholesale liquidation of the internees, some crawled
under their beds, others, in sheer terror, did not move, some might have
thought it was better so, better no health than too little, if a person
has to go, let it be quick. The first to react were the contaminated
internees. They had started to flee when the shooting broke out, but
then the silence encouraged them to go back, and once again they headed
for the door leading into the hallway. They saw the bodies lying in a
heap, the blood wending its way sinuously on the tiled floor where it
slowly spread, as if it were a living thing, and then the containers
with food. Hunger drove them on, there stood that much desired
sustenance, true it was intended for the blind, their own food was still
on its way, in accordance with the regulations, but who cares about the
regulations, no one can see us, the candle that lights the way burns
brightest, as the ancients have continuously reminded us throughout the
ages, and the ancients know about these things. Their hunger, however,
had the strength only to take them three steps forward, reason
intervened and warned them that for anybody imprudent enough to advance
there was danger lurking in those lifeless bodies, above all, in that
blood, who could tell what vapours, what emanations, what poisonous
miasmas might not already be oozing forth from the open wounds of the
corpses. They’re dead, they can’t do any harm, someone remarked, the
intention was to reassure himself and others, but his words made matters
worse, it was true that these blind internees were dead, that they could
not move, see, could neither stir nor breathe, but who can say that this
white blindness is not some spiritual malaise, and if we assume this to
be the case, then the spirits of those blind casualties have never been
as free as they are now, released from their bodies, and therefore free
to do whatever they like, above all, to do evil, which, as everyone
knows, has always been the easiest thing to do. But the containers of
food, standing there exposed, immediately attracted their attention,
such are the demands of the stomach, they heed nothing even when it is
for their own good. From one of the containers leaked a white liquid
which was slowly spreading towards the pool of blood, to all appearances
it was milk, the colour unmistakable. More courageous, or simply more
fatalistic, the distinction is not always easy to make, two of the
contaminated internees stepped forward, and they were just about to lay
their greedy hands on the first container when a group of blind
internees appeared in the doorway leading to the other wing. The
imagination can play such tricks, especially in morbid circumstances
such as these, that for these two men who had gone on a foray, it was as
if the dead had suddenly risen from the ground, as blind as before, no
doubt, but much more dangerous, for almost certainly filled by a spirit
of revenge. They prudently backed away in silence towards the entrance
to their wing, perhaps the blind internees were beginning to take care
of the corpses as charity and respect decreed, or, if not, they might
leave behind without noticing one of the containers, however small, in
fact there were not all that many contaminated internees there, perhaps
the best solution would be to ask them, Please, take pity on us, at
least leave a small container for us, after what has happened it is most
likely that no more food will be delivered today. The blind moved as one
would expect of the blind, groping their way, stumbling, dragging their
feet, yet as if organised, they knew how to distribute tasks
efficiently, some of them splashing about in the sticky blood and milk,
began at once to withdraw and transport the corpses to the yard, others
dealt with the eight containers, one by one, that had been dumped by the
soldiers. Among the blind internees there was a woman who gave the
impression of being everywhere at the same time, helping to load, acting
as if she were guiding the men, something that was obviously impossible
for a blind woman, and, whether by chance or intentionally, more than
once she turned her head towards the wing where the con taminated were
interned, as if she could see them or sense their presence. In a short
time the hallway was empty, with no other traces than the huge
bloodstain, and another small one alongside, white, from the milk that
had spilled, apart from these only criss-crossing footprints in red or
simply wet. Resigned, the contaminated internees closed the door and
went in search of crumbs, they were so downhearted that one of them was
on the point of saying, and this shows just how desperate they were, If
we really have to end up blind, if that is our fate, we might as well
move over into the other wing now, there at least we’ll have something
to eat, Perhaps the soldiers will still bring our rations, someone
suggested, Have you ever been in the army, another asked him, No, Just
as I thought.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that the dead belonged to the one as much as the
other, the occupants of the first and second wards gathered together in
order to decide whether they should eat first and then bury the corpses,
or the other way round. No one seemed interested in knowing who had
died. Five of them had installed themselves in the second ward,
difficult to say if they had already known each other, or if they did
not, if they had the time and inclination to introduce themselves to
each other and unburden their hearts. The doctor’s wife could not
remember having seen them when they arrived. The remaining four, yes,
these she recognised, they had slept with her, in a manner of speaking,
under the same roof, although this was all she knew about one of them,
and how could she know more, a man with any self-respect does not go
around discussing his private affairs with the first person he meets,
such as having been in a hotel room where he made love to a girl with
dark glasses, who, in her turn, if we mean her, has no idea that he has
been interned here and that she is still so close to the man who was the
cause of her seeing everything white. The taxi-driver and the two
policemen were the other casualties, three robust fellows who could take
care of themselves, whose professions meant, in different ways, looking
after others, and in the end there they lie, cruelly mowed down in their
prime and waiting for others to decide their fate. They will have to
wait until those who survived have finished eating, not because of the
usual egoism of the living, but because someone sensibly remembered that
to bury nine corpses in that hard soil and with only one spade was a
chore that would take until dinner-time at least. And since it would not
be admissible that the volunteers endowed with good will should work
while the others stuffed their bellies, it was decided to leave the
corpses until later. The food arrived in individual portions, therefore
easy to share out, that’s yours, and yours, until there was no more. But
the anxiety of some of the less fair-minded blind internees came to
complicate what in normal circumstances would have been so
straightforward, and although a serene and impartial judgment cautions
us to admit that the excesses that took place had some justification, we
need only remember, for example, that no one could know, at the outset,
whether there would be enough food for everyone. In fact, it is fairly
clear that it is not easy to count blind people or to distribute rations
without eyes capable of seeing either the rations or the people.
Moreover, some of the inmates from the second ward, with more than
reprehensible dishonesty, tried to give the impression that there were
more of them than there actually were. As always, this is where the
presence of the doctor’s wife proved to be useful. A few timely words
have always managed to resolve problems that a verbose speech would only
make worse. No less ill-intentioned and perverse were those who not only
tried, but actually succeeded in receiving double rations. The doctor’s
wife was aware of this abuse, but thought it wise to say nothing. She
could not even bear to think of the consequences that would ensue if it
were to be discovered that she was not blind, at the very least she
would find herself at the beck and call of everyone, at worst, she might
become the slave of some of them. The idea, aired at the outset, that
someone should assume responsibility for each ward, might have helped,
who knows? to solve these difficulties and others, alas, more serious,
on condition however, that the authority of the person in charge,
undeniably fragile, undeniably precarious, undeniably called into
question at every moment, should be clearly exercised for the benefit of
all and as such be acknowledged by the majority. Unless we succeed in
this, she thought, we shall end up murdering one another in here. She
promised herself that she would discuss these delicate matters with her
husband and went on sharing out the rations.</p>
<p>Some out of indolence, others because they had a delicate stomach,
had no inclination to go and practise grave-digging just after they had
eaten. Because of his profession, the doctor felt more responsible than
the others, and when he said without much enthusiasm, Let’s go and bury
the corpses, there was not a single volunteer. Stretched out on their
beds, the blind internees were interested only in being left in peace to
digest their food, some fell asleep immediately, hardly surprising,
after the frightening experience they had been through, the body, even
though poorly nourished, abandoned itself to the slow workings of
digestive chemistry. Later, as evening was drawing in, when, because of
the progressive waning of natural light, the dim lamps appeared to gain
some strength, showing at the same time, weak as they were, the little
purpose they served, the doctor, accompanied by his wife, persuaded two
men from his ward to accompany them to the compound, even if only to
balance out the work that had to be done and separate the corpses that
were already stiff, once it had been decided that each ward would bury
its own dead. The advantage enjoyed by these blind men was what might be
called the illusion of light. In fact, it made no difference to them
whether it was day or night, the first light of dawn or the evening
twilight, the silent hours of early morning or the bustling din of noon,
these blind people were for ever surrounded by a resplendent whiteness,
like the sun shining through mist. For the latter, blindness did not
mean being plunged into banal darkness, but living inside a luminous
halo. When the doctor let slip that they were going to separate the
corpses, the first blind man, who was one of those who had agreed to
help him, wanted to know how they would be able to recognise them, a
logical question on the part of a blind man which left the doctor in
some confusion. This time his wife thought it would be unwise to come to
his assistance for fear of giving the game away. The doctor got out of
the difficulty gracefully by the radical method of coming clean, that is
to say, by acknowledging his mistake, People, he said, in the tone of
voice of someone amused at his own expense, get so used to having eyes
that they think they can use them when they no longer serve for
anything, in fact, all we know is that there are four from our ward
here, the taxi-driver, the two policemen, and one other who was with us,
therefore the solution is to pick up four of these corpses at random,
bury them with due respect, and in this way we fulfill our obligation.
The first blind man agreed, his companion likewise, and once again,
taking it in turn, they began digging graves. These helpers would never
come to know, blind as they were, that, without exception, the corpses
buried were precisely those of whom they had been speaking, nor need we
mention the work done, seemingly at random, by the doctor, his hand
guided by that of his wife, she would grab a leg or arm, and all he had
to say was, This one. When they had already buried two corpses, there
finally emerged from the ward, three men disposed to help, most likely
they would have been less willing had someone told them that it was
already the dead of night. Psychologically, even when a man is blind, we
must acknowledge that there is a considerable difference between digging
graves by the light of day and after the sun has gone down. The moment
they were back in the ward, sweating, covered in earth, the sickly smell
of decomposed flesh still in their nostrils, the voice over the
loudspeaker repeated the usual instructions. There was no reference
whatsoever to what had happened, no mention of gunfire or casualties
shot at point-blank range. Warnings such as, To abandon the building
without any authorisation will mean immediate death, or The internees
will bury the corpses in the grounds without any formalities, now,
thanks to the harsh experience of life, supreme mistress of all
disciplines, these warnings took on real meaning, while the announcement
that promised containers of food three times a day seemed grotesquely
ironic or, worse, contemptuous. When the voice fell silent, the doctor,
on his own, because he was getting to know every nook and cranny in the
place, went to the door of the other ward to inform the inmates, We have
buried our dead, Well, if you’ve buried some, you can bury the rest,
replied a man’s voice from within, The agreement was that each ward
would bury its own dead, we counted four and buried them, That’s fine,
tomorrow we’ll deal with those from here, said another masculine voice,
and then in a different tone of voice, he asked, Has no more food turned
up, No, replied the doctor, But the loudspeaker said three times a day,
I doubt whether they are likely always to keep their promise, Then we’ll
have to ration the food that might arrive, said a woman’s voice, That
seems a good idea, if you like, we can talk about it tomorrow, Agreed,
said the woman. The doctor was already on the point of leaving when the
voice of the first man to speak could be heard, Who’s giving the orders
here, He paused, expecting to be given an answer, and it came from the
same feminine voice, Unless we organise ourselves in earnest, hunger and
fear will take over here, it is shameful that we didn’t go with the
others to bury the dead, Why don’t you go and do the burying since
you’re so clever and sure of yourself, I cannot go alone but I’m
prepared to help, There’s no point in arguing, intervened another
masculine voice, we’ll settle this first thing in the morning. The
doctor sighed, life together was going to be difficult. He was already
heading back to his ward when he felt a pressing need to relieve
himself. At the spot where he found himself, he was not sure that he
would be able to find the lavatories, but he decided to take a chance.
He was hoping that someone would at least have remembered to leave there
the toilet paper which had been delivered with the containers of food.
He got lost twice on the way and was in some distress because he was
beginning to feel desperate and just when he could hold back no longer,
he was finally able to take down his trousers and crouch over the open
latrine. The stench choked him. He had the impression of having stepped
on some soft pulp, the excrement of someone who had missed the hole of
the latrine or who had decided to relieve himself without any
consideration for others. He tried to imagine what the place must look
like, for him it was all white, luminous, resplendent, he had no way of
knowing whether the walls and ground were white and he came to the
absurd conclusion that the light and whiteness there were giving off the
awful stench. We shall go mad with horror, he thought. Then he tried to
clean himself but there was no paper. He ran his hand over the wall
behind him, where he expected to find the rolls of toilet paper or
nails, where in the absence of anything better, any old scraps of paper
had been stuck up. Nothing. He felt unhappy, disconsolate, more
unfortunate than he could bear, crushed there, protecting his trousers
which were brushing against that disgusting floor, blind, blind, blind,
and, unable to control himself, he began to weep quietly. Fumbling, he
took a few steps and bumped into the opposite wall. He stretched out one
arm, then the other, and finally found a door. He could hear the
shuffling footsteps of someone who must also have been looking for the
lavatories, and who kept tripping, Where the hell are they? the person
was muttering in a neutral voice, as if deep down, he was not all that
interested in finding out. He passed close to the toilets without
realising there was someone there, but no matter, the situation did not
degenerate into indecency, if it could be called that, a man caught in
an embarrassing situation, his clothes in disarray, at the last minute,
moved by a disconcerting sense of shame, the doctor had pulled up his
trousers. Then he lowered them, when he thought he was alone, but not in
time, he knew he was dirty, dirtier than he could ever remember having
been in his life. There are many ways of becoming an animal, he thought,
this is just the first of them. However, he could not really complain,
he still had someone who did not mind cleaning him.</p>
<p>Lying on their beds, the blind internees waited for sleep to take
pity on their misery. Discreetly, as if there was some danger that
others might see this distressing sight, the doctor’s wife had helped
her husband to clean himself as well as she could. There was now that
sorrowful silence one finds in hospitals when the patients are asleep
and suffer even as they sleep. Sitting up and alert, the doctor’s wife
looked at the beds, at the shadowy forms, the fixed pallor of a face, an
arm that moved while dreaming. She wondered whether she would ever go
blind like them, what inexplicable reasons had saved her from blindness
so far. With a weary gesture, she raised her hands to draw back her
hair, and thought, We’re all going to stink to high heaven. At that
moment sighs could be heard, moaning, tiny cries, muffled at first,
sounds that seemed to be words, that ought to be words, but whose
meaning got lost in the crescendo that transformed them into shouts and
grunts and finally heavy, stertorous breathing. Someone protested at the
far end of the ward. Pigs, they’re like pigs. They were not pigs, only a
blind man and a blind woman who probably knew nothing more about each
other than this.</p>
