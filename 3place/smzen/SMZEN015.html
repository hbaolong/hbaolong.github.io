<h4 id="section">14</h4>
<p>They dressed and put their shoes on, what they still had not solved
was some way of washing themselves, but they already looked quite
different from the other blind people, the colours of their clothes,
notwithstanding the relative scarcity of the range on offer, for, as
people often say, the fruit is hand-picked, go well with each other,
that is the advantage of having someone on the spot to advise us, You
wear this, it goes better with those trousers, the stripes don’t clash
with the spots, details like that, to the men, of course, these matters
do not make a blind bit of difference, but both the girl with dark
glasses and the wife of the first blind man insisted on knowing what
colours and styles they were wearing, so that, with the help of their
imaginations they have some idea of how they look. As for footwear,
everyone agreed that comfort should come before beauty, no fancy lacing
and high heels, no calf or patent leather, given the state of the roads
such refinements would be absurd, what they want here are rubber boots,
completely waterproof and coming halfway up the leg, easy to slip into
and out of, there is nothing better for walking through mud.
Unfortunately, boots of this kind could not be found for everyone, there
were no boots to fit the boy with the squint, for example, the larger
sizes were like boats on him, so he had to settle for a pair of sports
shoes with no clearly defined purpose, What a coincidence, his mother
would say, wherever she might be, when someone told her what had
happened, those are exactly the shoes my son would have chosen had he
been able to see. The old man with the black eyepatch, whose feet were
on the large side, solved the problem by wearing basketball shoes,
specially made for players six foot tall and with extremities to match.
It is true that he looks somewhat comical, as if he were wearing white
slippers, but he will look ridiculous only for a while, within ten
minutes the shoes will be filthy, just like everything else in life, let
time take its course and it will find a solution.</p>
<p>It has stopped raining, there are no blind people standing about
gaping. They go around not knowing what to do, they wander through the
streets, but never for very long, walking or standing still is all the
same to them, they have no other objective than the search for food, the
music has stopped, never has there been so much silence in the world,
the cinemas and theatres are only frequented by the homeless who have
given up searching, some theatres, the larger ones, had been used to
keep the blind in quarantine when the Government, or the few survivors,
still believed that the white sickness could be remedied with devices
and certain strategies that had been so ineffectual in the past against
yellow fever and other infectious plagues, but this came to an end, not
even a fire was needed here. As for the museums, it is truly
heart-breaking, all those people, and I do mean people, all those
paintings, all those sculptures, without a single visitor standing
before them. What are the blind in this city waiting for, who knows,
they might be awaiting a cure if they still believed in it, but they
lost that hope when it became public knowledge that the epidemic of
blindness had spared no one, that not a single person had been left with
the eyesight to look through the lens of a microscope, that the
laboratories had been abandoned, where there was no other solution for
the bacteria but to feed on each other if they hoped to survive. In the
beginning, many of the blind, accompanied by relatives who so far had
maintained some sense of family solidarity, still rushed to the
hospitals, but there they found only blind doctors feeling the pulse of
patients they could not see, listening to them back and front, this was
all they could do, since they still had their hearing. Then, feeling the
pangs of hunger, those patients who could still walk began to flee the
hospitals, they ended up dying unprotected on the streets, their
families, if they still had them, could be anywhere, and then, so that
they might be buried, it was not enough for someone to trip over them
accidentally, their corpses had to start to smell, and even then, only
if they had died in some main thoroughfare. Little wonder that there are
so many dogs, some of them already resemble hyenas, the spots on their
pelt are like those of putrefaction, they run around with their hind
quarters drawn in, as if afraid that the dead and devoured might come
back to life in order to make them pay for the shame of biting those who
could not defend themselves. What’s the world like these days, the old
man with the black eyepatch had asked, and the doctor’s wife replied,
There’s no difference between inside and outside, between here and
there, between the many and the few, between what we’re living through
and what we shall have to live through, And the people, how are they
coping, asked the girl with dark glasses, They go around like ghosts,
this must be what it means to be a ghost, being certain that life
exists, because your four senses say so, and yet unable to see it, Are
there lots of cars out there, asked the first blind man, who was unable
to forget that his had been stolen, It’s like a cemetery. Neither the
doctor nor the wife of the first blind man asked any questions, what was
the point, when the replies were such as these. As for the little boy
with the squint, he has the satisfaction of wearing the shoes he had
always dreamt of having and he is not even saddened by the fact that he
cannot see them. This is probably the reason why he does not look like a
ghost. And the dog of tears, who trails after the doctor’s wife, would
scarcely deserve to be called a hyena, he does not follow the scent of
dead meat, he accompanies a pair of eyes that he knows are alive and
well.</p>
<p>The home of the girl with dark glasses is not far away, but after
being starved for a week, it is only now that the members of this group
begin to recover their strength, that is why they walk so slowly, in
order to rest they have no option but to sit on the ground, it had not
been worthwhile taking so much trouble to choose colours and styles,
when in such a short time their clothes are filthy. The street where the
girl with dark glasses lives is not only short but narrow which explains
why there are no cars to be seen here, they could pass in one direction
only, but there was no place to park, it was prohibited. That there were
also no people was not surprising, in streets like these there are many
moments throughout the day when there is not a living soul to be seen,
What’s the number of your house, asked the doctor’s wife, number seven,
I live on the second floor in the flat on the left. One of the windows
was open, at any other time that would be a sign that there was almost
certainly someone at home, now everything was uncertain. The doctor’s
wife said, No need for all of us to go up, we two shall go on our own,
the rest of you wait below. She realised the front door leading on to
the street had been forced, the mortice lock was clearly twisted, a long
splinter of wood had almost come away from the doorpost. The doctor’s
wife mentioned none of this. She let the girl go ahead since she knew
the way, she did not mind the shadows into which the stairway was
plunged. In her nervous haste, the girl with dark glasses stumbled
twice, but laughed it off, Just imagine, stairs that I used to be able
to go up and down with my eyes closed, clichés are like that, they are
insensitive to the thousand subtleties of meaning, this one, for
example, does not know the difference between closing one’s eyes and
being blind. On the landing of the second floor, the door they were
looking for was closed. The girl with dark glasses ran her hand over the
moulding until she found the bell, There’s no light, the doctor’s wife
reminded her, and the girl received these four words that only repeated
what everyone knew like a message bringing bad news. She knocked at the
door, once, twice, three times, the third time loudly, using her fists
and calling out, Mummy, daddy, and no one came to open, these terms of
endearment did not affect the reality, no one came to say to her,
Dearest daughter, you’ve come at last, we had given up hope of ever
seeing you again, come in, come in, and let this lady who is your friend
come in too, the house is a little untidy, pay no attention, the door
remained closed. There is no one here, said the girl with dark glasses,
and burst into tears leaning against the door, her head on her crossed
forearms, as if with her whole body she were desperately imploring pity,
if we did not have enough experience of how complicated the human spirit
can be we would be surprised that she should be so fond of her parents
as to indulge in these demonstrations of sorrow, a girl so free in her
behaviour, but not far away is someone who has already affirmed that
there does not exist nor ever has existed any contradiction between the
one and the other. The doctor’s wife tried to console her, but had
little to say, it is well known that it is practically impossible for
people to remain for a long time in their houses, We could ask the
neighbours, she suggested, if there are any, Yes, let’s go and ask, said
the girl with dark glasses, but there was no hope in her voice. They
began by knocking on the door on the other side of the landing, where
once again no one replied. On the floor above the two doors were open.
The flats had been ransacked, the wardrobes were empty, in the cupboards
where food had been stored there was nothing to be found. There were
signs that someone had been here recently, no doubt a group of vagrants,
as they were all more or less by now, wandering from house to house,
from absence to absence.</p>
<p>They went down to the first floor, the doctor’s wife rapped on the
nearest door, there was an expectant silence, then a gruff voice asked
suspiciously, Who’s there, the girl with dark glasses stepped forward,
It’s me, your upstairs neighbour, I’m looking for my parents, do you
know where I can find them, what happened to them, she asked. They could
hear shuffling footsteps, the door opened and a gaunt old woman
appeared, nothing but skin and bone, emaciated, her long white hair
dishevelled. A nauseating smell of mustiness and an indefinable
putrefaction caused the two women to step back. The old woman opened her
eyes wide, they were almost white, I know nothing about your parents,
they came to fetch them the day after they took you away, at that time I
could still see, Is there anyone else in the building, Now and then I
can hear people climbing up or going down the stairs, but they are from
outside and only come here to sleep, And what about my parents, I’ve
already told you I know nothing about them, And what about your husband,
your son and daughter-in-law, They took them away too, But left you
behind, why, Because I was hiding, Where, Just imagine, in your flat,
How did you manage to get in, Through the back and up the fire escape, I
smashed a window-pane and opened the door from inside, the key was in
the lock, And how have you managed since then to live all alone in your
flat, asked the doctor’s wife, Who else is here, asked the startled old
woman turning her head, She’s a friend of mine, she’s with my group, the
girl with dark glasses reassured her, And it’s not just a question of
being alone, what about food, how have you managed to get food during
all this time, insisted the doctor’s wife, The fact is that I’m no fool
and I’m perfectly capable of looking after myself, If you’d rather not
say, don’t, I’m simply curious, Then I’ll tell you, the first thing I
did was to go round all the flats and gather up any food I could find,
whatever might go bad I ate at once, the rest I kept, Do you still have
some left, asked the girl with dark glasses, No, it’s finished, replied
the old woman with a sudden expression of mistrust in her sightless
eyes, a way of speaking that is always used in similar situations, but
it has no basis in fact, because the eyes, the eyes strictly speaking,
have no expression, not even when they have been plucked out, they are
two round objects that remain inert, it is the eyelids, the eyelashes
and the eyebrows, that have to take on board the different visual
eloquences and rhetorics, notwithstanding that this is normally
attributed to the eyes, So what are you living on now, asked the
doctor’s wife, Death stalks the streets, but in the back gardens life
goes on, the old woman said mysteriously, What do you mean, The back
gardens have cabbages, rabbits, hens, they also have flowers, but
they’re not for eating, And how do you cope, It depends, sometimes I
pick some cabbages, at other times I kill a rabbit or chicken, And eat
them raw, At first I used to light a fire, then I got used to raw meat,
and the stalks of the cabbages are sweet, don’t you worry yourselves, my
mother’s daughter will not die of hunger. She stepped back two paces,
almost disappeared into the darkness of the house, only her white eyes
shone, and she said from within, If you want to go into your flat, go
ahead, I won’t stop you. The girl with dark glasses was about to say no,
many thanks, it isn’t worth it, to what purpose, if my parents aren’t
there, but suddenly she felt the desire to see her room, to see my room,
how foolish, if I’m blind, at least to touch the walls, the bedcover,
the pillow where I used to rest my crazy head, over the furniture,
perhaps on the chest of drawers there might still be the flowers in the
vase she remem bered, unless the old woman had thrown them on the floor,
annoyed that they could not be eaten. She said, Well, if you don’t mind,
I’ll accept your offer, it’s very kind of you, Come in, come in, but
don’t expect to find any food, what I have is barely enough for me,
besides it would be no good to you unless you like raw meat, Don’t
worry, we have food, Ah, so you have food, in that case you can repay
the favour and leave me some, We’ll give you some food, don’t worry,
said the doctor’s wife. They had already walked down the corridor, the
stench had become unbearable. In the kitchen, dimly lit by the waning
light outside, there were rabbit skins on the floor, chicken feathers,
bones, and on the table, in a dirty plate covered in dried blood,
unrecognisable pieces of meat, as if they had been chewed over and over
again, And the rabbits and hens, what do they eat, asked the doctor’s
wife, Cabbages, weeds, any scraps left over, said the old woman, Don’t
tell us the hens and rabbits eat meat, The rabbits don’t yet, but the
hens love it, animals are like people, they get used to everything in
the end. The old woman moved steadily, without tottering, she moved a
chair out of the way as if she could see, then pointed to the door that
led on to the emergency stairs, Through here, be careful not to slip,
the handrail is not very secure. And what about the door, asked the girl
with dark glasses, You only have to push the door, I have the key, it’s
somewhere around, It’s mine, the girl was about to say, but at that same
instant reflected that this key would be no good to her if her parents,
or someone acting on their behalf, had taken away the others, the ones
for the front door, she could not ask this neighbour to allow her to
pass every time she wanted to come in or go out. She felt her heart
contract slightly, probably because she was about to enter her own home
and discover that her parents were not there, or for whatever
reason.</p>
<p>The kitchen was clean and tidy, the dust on the furniture was not
excessive, another advantage of this rainy weather, as well as having
made the cabbages and greens grow, in fact, the back gardens, seen from
above, had struck the doctor’s wife as being jungles in miniature, Could
the rabbits be running around freely, she asked herself, most unlikely,
they would still be housed in the rabbit-hutches waiting for that blind
hand to bring them cabbage leaves then grab them by the ears and pull
them out kicking, while the other hand prepares the blind blow that will
break the vertebrae near the skull. The memory of the girl with dark
glasses had guided her into the flat, just as the old woman on the floor
below neither tripped nor faltered, her parents’ bed was unmade, they
must have come to detain them in the early hours of morning, she sat
down there and wept, the doctor’s wife came to sit beside her, and told
her, Don’t cry, what else could she say, what meaning do tears have when
the world has lost all meaning, In the girl’s room on the chest of
drawers stood the glass vase with the withered flowers, the water had
evaporated, it was there that her blind hands directed themselves, her
fingers brushed against the dead petals, how fragile life is when it is
abandoned. The doctor’s wife opened the window, she looked down into the
street, there they all were, seated on the ground, patiently waiting,
the dog of tears was the only creature to raise his head, alerted by his
keen hearing. The sky, once more overcast, began to darken, night was
approaching. She thought that today they would not need to go and search
for some refuge where they might sleep, they would stay here. The old
woman is not going to be at all pleased if everyone starts tramping
through her house, she murmured. Just at that moment, the girl with dark
glasses touched her on the shoulder, saying, The keys were in the lock,
they did not take them. The problem, if there was one, was therefore
resolved, they would not have to put up with the ill-humour of the old
woman on the first floor, I’m going down to call them, it will soon be
night, how good, at least today we shall be able to sleep in a proper
home with a roof over our heads, said the doctor’s wife, You and your
husband can sleep in my parents’ bed, We’ll see about that later, I’m
the one who gives the orders here, I’m in my own home, You’re right,
just as you wish, the doctor’s wife embraced the girl, then went down to
look for the others. Climbing the stairs, chattering with excitement,
now and then tripping on the stairs despite having been told by their
guide, There are ten steps to each flight, it was as if they had come on
a visit. The dog of tears followed them quietly, as if this were an
everyday occurrence. From the landing, the girl with dark glasses looked
down, it is the custom when someone is coming up, whether it be to find
out who it is, if the person is a stranger, or to greet someone with
words of welcome if they are friends, in this case no eyes were needed
to know who was arriving. Come in, come in, make yourselves comfortable.
The old woman on the first floor had come to her door to pry, she
thought this lot was one of those mobs who turned up to sleep, in this
she was not wrong, she asked, Who’s there, and the girl with dark
glasses replied from above, It’s my group, the old woman was puzzled,
how had she been able to reach the landing, then it dawned on her and
she was annoyed with herself for having forgotten to retrieve the keys
from the front door, it was as if she were losing her proprietorial
rights over this building in which she had been the sole occupant for
many months. She could find no better way of compensating for her sudden
frustration than to say, opening the door, Remember you said you’d give
me some food, don’t go forgetting your promise. And since neither the
doctor’s wife nor the girl with dark glasses, the one busy guiding those
who were arriving, the other in receiving them, made any reply, she
shouted hysterically, Did you hear me, a mistake on her part, because
the dog of tears, who at that precise moment was passing her, leapt at
her and started barking furiously, the entire stairway echoed with the
uproar, it was perfect, the old woman shrieked in terror and rushed back
into her flat, slamming the door behind her, Who is that witch, asked
the old man with the black eyepatch, these are things we say when we do
not know how to take a good look at ourselves, had he lived as she had
lived, we should like to see how long his civilised ways would last.</p>
<p>There was no food apart from what they had brought in the bags, they
had to be sparing with it down to the very last drop, and, as for
lighting, they had been most fortunate to find two candles in the
kitchen cupboard, kept there to be used whenever there happened to be a
power cut and which the doctor’s wife lit for her own benefit, the
others did not need them, they already had a light inside their heads,
so strong it had blinded them. Though meagre rations were all this
little group had, yet it ended up as a family feast, one of those rare
feasts where what belongs to one, belongs to everybody. Before seating
themselves at the table, the girl with dark glasses and the doctor’s
wife went down to the floor below, they went to fulfill their promise,
were it not more exact to say that they went to satisfy a demand,
payment with food for their passage through that customs house. The old
woman received them, whining and surly, that cursed dog that only by
some miracle did not devour her, You must have a lot of food to be able
to feed such a beast, she insinuated, as if expecting, by means of this
accusing observation, to arouse in the two emissaries what we call
remorse, what they were really saying to each other, it would be
inhumane to leave a poor old woman to die of starvation while a dumb
animal gorges itself on scraps. The two women did not turn back to get
more food, what they were carrying was already a generous ration, if we
take into account the difficult circumstances of life at present, and
this strangely enough, was how the old lady on the floor below appraised
the situation, when all is said and done, less mean-hearted than she
seemed, and she went back in side to find the keys for the back door,
saying to the girl with dark glasses, Take it, this key is yours, and,
as if this were not enough, she was still muttering as she closed her
door, Many thanks. Amazed, the two women returned upstairs, so the old
witch had feelings after all, She was not a bad person, living all that
time alone must have unhinged her, commented the girl with dark glasses
without appearing to think what she was saying. The doctor’s wife did
not reply, she decided to keep any conversation for later, and once all
the others were in bed, some of them asleep, and the two women were
sitting in the kitchen like mother and daughter trying to gather
strength for the other chores to be done around the house, the doctor’s
wife asked, And you, what are you going to do now, Nothing, I’ll wait
here until my parents return, Alone and blind, I’ve got used to being
blind, And what about solitude, I’ll have to accept it, the old woman
below also lives alone, You don’t want to become like her, feeding on
cabbages and raw meat, while they last, in these buildings around here
there appears to be no one else living, you would be two women hating
each other for fear that the food might come to an end, each stalk you
gathered would be like taking it from the other’s mouth, you didn’t see
that poor woman, you only caught the stench coming from her flat, I can
assure you that not even where we were living before were things so
repugnant, Sooner or later, we shall all be like her, and then it will
all be over, there will be no more life, Meanwhile, we’re still alive,
Listen, you know much more than I do, compared with you I’m simply an
ignorant girl, but in my opinion we’re already dead, we’re blind because
we’re dead, or if you would prefer me to put it another way, we’re dead
because we’re blind, it comes to the same thing, I can still see, Lucky
for you, lucky for your husband, for me, for the others, but you don’t
know how long you will go on seeing, should you become blind you will be
like the rest of us, we’ll all end up like the neighbour below, Today is
today, tomorrow will bring what tomorrow brings, today is my
responsibility, not tomorrow if I should turn blind, What do you mean by
responsibility, The responsibility of having my eyesight when others
have lost theirs, You cannot hope to guide or provide food for all the
blind people in this world, I ought to, But you cannot, I shall do
whatever I can to help, Of course you will, had it not been for you I
might not be alive today, And I don’t want you to die now, I must stay,
it’s my duty, I want my parents to find me if they should return, If
they should return, you yourself said it, and we have no way of knowing
whether they will still be your parents, I don’t understand, You said
that the neighbour below was a good person at heart, Poor woman, Your
poor parents, poor you, when you meet up, blind in eyes and blind in
feelings, because the feelings with which we have lived and which
allowed us to live as we were, depended on our having the eyes we were
born with, without eyes feelings become something different, we do not
know how, we do not know what, you say we’re dead because we’re blind,
there you have it, Do you love your husband, Yes, as I love myself, but
should I turn blind, if after turning blind I should no longer be the
person I was, how would I then be able to go on loving him, and with
what love, Before, when we could still see, there were also blind
people, Few in comparison, the feelings in use were those of someone who
could see, therefore blind people felt with the feelings of others, not
as the blind people they were, now, certainly, what is emerging are the
real feelings of the blind, and we’re still only at the beginning, for
the moment we still live on the memory of what we felt, you don’t need
eyes to know what life has become today, if anyone were to tell me that
one day I should kill, I’d take it as an insult, and yet I’ve killed,
What then would you have me do, Come with me, come to our house, And
what about the others, The same goes for them, but it’s you I most care
about, Why, I ask myself that question, perhaps because you have become
almost like a sister, perhaps because my husband slept with you, Forgive
me, It’s not a crime that calls for pardon, We would suck your blood and
be like parasites, There were plenty of them when we could see, and as
for blood, it has to serve some purpose besides sustaining the body that
carries it, and now let’s try to get some sleep for tomorrow is another
day.</p>
<p>Another day, or the same one. When he woke up, the boy with the
squint wanted to go to the lavatory, he had diarrhoea, something that
had disagreed with him in his weak condition, but it soon became obvious
that it was impossible to go in there, the old woman on the floor below
had clearly taken advantage of all the lavatories in the building until
they could no longer be used, only by some extraordinary stroke of luck
none of the seven, before going to bed last night, had needed to satisfy
the urge to relieve their bowels, otherwise they would already know just
how disgusting those lavatories were. Now they all felt the need to
relieve themselves, especially the poor boy who could not hold it in any
longer, in fact, however reluctant we might be to admit it, these
distasteful realities of life also have to be considered, when the
bowels function normally, anyone can have ideas, debate, for example,
whether there exists a direct relationship between the eyes and
feelings, or whether the sense of responsibility is the natural
consequence of clear vision, but when we are in great distress and
plagued by pain and anguish that is when the animal side of our nature
becomes most apparent. The garden, exclaimed the doctor’s wife, and she
was right, were it not so early, we would find the neighbour from the
flat below already there, it’s time we stopped calling her the old
woman, as we have disrespectfully done so far, she would already be
there, as we were saying, crouched down, surrounded by hens, because the
person who might ask the question almost certainly does not know what
hens are like. Clutching his belly, protected by the doctor’s wife, the
boy with the squint went down the stairs in agony, worse still, by the
time he reached the last steps, his sphincter had given up trying to
resist the internal pressure, so you can imagine the consequences.
Meanwhile, the other five were making their way as best they could down
the emergency stairs, a most suitable name, if they have any inhibitions
left since the time they lived in quarantine, this was the moment to
lose them. Scattered throughout the back garden, groaning with the
effort, suffering whatever remained of futile shame, they did what had
to be done, even the doctor’s wife who wept as she looked at them, she
wept for all of them, which they seemed no longer to be able to do, her
own husband, the first blind man and his wife, the girl with dark
glasses, the old man with the black eyepatch, the boy, she saw them
squatting on the weeds, between the knotty cabbage stalks, with the hens
watching, the dog of tears had also come down to make one more. They
cleaned themselves as best they could, superficially and in haste, with
some handfuls of grass or broken bits of brick, wherever the arm could
reach, in some cases the attempt to tidy up only made matters worse.
They went back up the emergency stairs in silence, the neighbour on the
first floor did not appear to ask them who they were, where they had
come from, where they were going, she must still be sleeping off her
supper, and when they got into the flat, first they did not know what to
say, then the girl with dark glasses pointed out that they could not
remain in that state, it is true that there was no water with which to
wash themselves, pity there was no torrential rain like that of
yesterday, they would go out once more into the garden, but now naked
and without shame, they would receive on their head and shoulders the
generous water from the sky above, they would feel it running down their
back and chest, down their legs, they could gather it in their hands,
clean at last and in this cup offer it to someone to quench their
thirst, no matter who, perhaps their lips would gently touch their skin
before finding the water, and desperately thirsty as they were, they
would eagerly gather the last drops from that shell, thus arousing, who
knows, another thirst. What leads the girl with dark glasses astray, as
we have seen on other occasions, is her imagination, what would she have
to remember in a situation like this, tragic, grotesque, desperate as it
was. Despite everything, she is not without some sense of the practical,
the proof being that she went to open the wardrobe in her room, then
that of her parents, where she gathered up sheets and towels, Let’s
clean ourselves up with these, she said, it’s better than nothing, and
there is no doubt that it was a good idea, when they sat down to eat
they felt quite different.</p>
<p>It was at the table that the doctor’s wife told them what was on her
mind. The time has come to decide what we want to do, I’m convinced the
entire population is blind, at least that is my impression from
observing the behaviour of the people I have seen so far, there is no
water, there is no electricity, there are no supplies of any kind, this
must be what chaos is, this is what is really meant by chaos. There must
be a government, said the first blind man, I’m not so sure, but if there
is, it will be a government of the blind trying to rule the blind, that
is to say, nothingness trying to organise nothingness, Then there is no
future, said the old man with the black eyepatch, I cannot say whether
there will be a future, what matters for the moment is to see how we can
live in the present, Without a future, the present serves no purpose,
it’s as if it did not exist, Perhaps humanity will manage to live
without eyes, but then it will cease to be humanity, the result is
obvious, which of us think of ourselves as being as human as we believed
ourselves to be before, I, for example, killed a man, You killed a man,
asked the first blind man in alarm, Yes, the one who gave orders on the
other side, I stabbed him in the throat with a pair of scissors, You
killed him to avenge us, only a woman could avenge the women, said the
girl with dark glasses, and revenge, being just, is something human, if
the victim has no rights over the wrong-doer then there can be no
justice, Nor humanity, added the wife of the first blind man, Let’s get
back to the matter we were discussing, said the doctor’s wife, if we
stay together we might manage to survive, if we separate we shall be
swallowed up by the masses and destroyed, You mentioned that there are
organised groups of blind people, observed the doctor, this means that
new ways of living are being invented and there is no reason why we
should finish up by being destroyed, as you predict, I don’t know to
what extent they are really organised, I only see them going around in
search of food and somewhere to sleep, nothing more, We’re going back to
being primitive hordes, said the old man with the black eyepatch, with
the difference that we are not a few thousand men and women in an
immense, unspoiled nature, but thousands of millions in an uprooted,
exhausted world, And blind, added the doctor’s wife, When it starts to
become difficult to find water and food, these groups will almost
certainly disband, each person will think they have a better chance of
surviving on their own, they will not have to share anything with
others, whatever they can grab belongs to them and to no one else, The
groups going around must have leaders, someone who gives orders and
organises things, the first blind man reminded them, Perhaps, but in
this case those who give the orders are just as blind as those who
receive them, You’re not blind, said the girl with dark glasses, that’s
why you were the obvious person to give orders and organise the rest of
us, I don’t give orders, I organise things as best I can, I am simply
the eyes that the rest of you no longer possess, A kind of natural
leader, a king with eyes in the land of the blind, said the old man with
the black eyepatch, If this is so, then allow yourselves to be guided by
my eyes so long as they last, therefore what I propose is that instead
of dispersing, her in her house, you in yours, let us continue to live
together, We can stay here, said the girl with dark glasses, Our house
is bigger, Assuming it has not been occupied, the wife of the first
blind man pointed out, When we get there we’ll find out, and if it
should be occupied we can come back here, or go and take a look at your
house, or yours, she added, addressing the old man with the black
eye-patch, and he replied, I have no home of my own, I lived alone in a
room, Have you no family, asked the girl with dark glasses, No family
whatsoever, Not even a wife, children, brothers and sisters, No one,
Unless my parents turn up, I shall be alone just like you. I’ll stay
with you, said the boy with the squint, but did not add, Unless my
mother turns up, he did not lay down this condition, strange behaviour,
or perhaps not so strange, the young quickly adapt, they have their
whole life before them. What do you think, asked the doctor’s wife, I’m
going with you, said the girl with dark glasses, all I ask is that you
should bring me here once a week just in case my parents should happen
to return, Will you leave the keys with the neighbour below, There’s no
alternative, she cannot take more than she has taken already, She might
destroy things, Now that I’ve been here, perhaps not, We’re coming with
you too, said the first blind man, although we should like, as soon as
possible, to pass by our home and find out what has happened, Of course,
No point in passing by my house, I’ve already told you it was just a
room. But you’ll come with us, Yes, on one condition, at first sight it
must seem scandalous for someone to lay down conditions when he is being
done a favour, but some old people are like that, they make up in pride
for the little time remaining to them, What condition is that, asked the
doctor, When I start becoming an impossible burden, you must tell me,
and if, out of friendship or pity, you should decide to say nothing, I
hope I’ll still have enough judgment to do the necessary, And what might
that be, I’d like to know, asked the girl with dark glasses, Withdraw,
take myself off, disappear, as elephants used to do, I’ve heard it said
that recently things have been different, none of these animals reach
old age, You’re not exactly an elephant, Nor am I exactly a man,
Especially if you start giving childish replies, retorted the girl with
dark glasses, and the conversation went no further.</p>
<p>The plastic bags are now much lighter than when they were brought
here, not surprisingly, the neighbour on the first floor also ate from
them, she ate twice, first last night, and today they left her some more
food when they asked her to take the keys and look after them until the
rightful owners turned up, a question of keeping the old girl sweet,
because as for her character we have learned more than enough, and the
dog of tears also had to be fed, only a heart of stone would have been
capable of feigning indifference before those pleading eyes, and while
we are on the subject, where has the dog disappeared to, he is not in
the flat, he did not go out the door, he can only be in the back garden,
the doctor’s wife went off to take a good look, and this was, in fact,
where he was, the dog of tears was devouring a hen, the attack had been
so quick that there was not even time to raise the alarm, but if the old
woman on the first floor had eyes and kept a count on her hens, who can
tell, out of anger, what fate might befall the keys, Between the
awareness of having committed a crime and the perception that the human
being whom he was protecting was going away, the dog of tears hesitated
only for an instant, then began at once to scratch the soft earth, and
before the old woman on the first floor appeared on the landing of the
fire escape to sniff out the sounds that were coming into her flat, the
hen’s carcass was buried, the crime covered up, remorse reserved for
some other occasion. The dog of tears sidled upstairs, brushed like a
breath of air past the skirts of the old woman, who had no idea of the
danger she had just faced, and went to settle beside the doctor’s wife,
where he announced to the heavens the feat he had just achieved. The old
woman on the first floor, hearing him bark so ferociously, feared, but
as we know all too late, for the safety of her larder, and, craning her
neck upwards, called, This dog must be kept under control before he
kills one of my hens, Don’t worry, replied the doctor’s wife, the dog
isn’t hungry, he has already eaten, and we’re leaving right away, Right
away, repeated the old woman, and there was a break in her voice as if
of pain, as if she wanted to be understood in a quite different way, for
example, You’re going to leave me here all alone, but she did not utter
another word, only that Right away which asked for no reply, the hard of
heart also have their sorrows, this woman’s heart was such that later
she refused to open her door to bid farewell to these ingrates to whom
she had given free access to her house. She heard them go downstairs,
they were talking amongst themselves, saying, Watch you don’t stumble,
Put your hand on my shoulder, Hold on to the bannister, the usual words,
but now much more common in this world of blind people, what did
surprise her was to hear one of the women say, It’s so dark in this
place that I can’t see a thing, that this woman’s blindness should not
be white was already surprising in itself, but that she could not see
because it was so dark, what could this mean, She wanted to think, tried
hard, but her weak head did not help, soon she was saying to herself, I
must have misheard, whatever it was. In the street, the doctor’s wife
remembered what she had said, she must watch what she was saying, she
could move like someone who has eyes, But my words must be those of a
blind person, she thought.</p>
<p>Assembled on the pavement, she arranged her companions in two rows of
three, in the first one she placed her husband and the girl with dark
glasses, with the boy with the squint in the middle, in the second row
the old man with the black eye-patch and the first blind man, one on
either side of the other woman. She wanted to keep all of them close to
her, not in the usual fragile Indian file, which can be broken at any
moment, they only needed to encounter a more numerous or more aggressive
group, and it would be like a steamer at sea cutting in two a sailboat
that happened to cross its path, we know the consequences of such
accidents, shipwrecks, disasters, people drowned, futile cries for help
in that vast expanse of water, the steamer already sailing on ahead, not
even aware of the collision, this is what would happen to this group, a
blind person here, another there, lost in the disordered currents of the
other blind people, like the waves of the sea that never stop and do not
know where they are going, and the doctor’s wife, too, not knowing to
whose assistance she should hasten first, placing her hand on her
husband’s arm, perhaps on that of the boy with the squint, but losing
the girl with dark glasses, the other two, the old man with the black
eyepatch, far away, heading for the elephants’ graveyard. What she is
doing now is to pass around herself and all the others a cord made from
strips of cloth knotted together while the rest were asleep, Don’t hold
on to me, she said, but hold on to the rope with all your strength, do
not let go under any circumstances, whatever may happen. They were
careful not to walk too closely to avoid tripping each other, but they
needed to feel the proximity of their neighbours, a direct contact if
possible, only one of them did not have to worry himself with these new
questions of overland tactics, this was the boy with the squint who
walked in the middle, protected on all sides. None of our blind friends
thought to ask how the other groups navigate, if they too are advancing
tied to each other by this or other processes, but the reply should be
easy from what we have been able to observe, groups in general, except
in the case of a more cohesive group for good reasons unknown to us,
gradually gain and lose adherents throughout the day, there is always
one blind man who strays and is lost, another who was caught by the
force of gravity and tags along, he might be accepted, he might be
expelled, depending on what he is carrying with him. The old woman on
the first floor slowly opened the window, she does not want anyone to
know that she has this sentimental weakness, but no noise can be heard
coming from the street, they have already gone, they have left this
place where almost no one ever passes, the old woman ought to be
pleased, in this way she will not have to share her hens and rabbits
with the others, she should be pleased but is not, in her blind eyes
appear two tears, for the first time she asked herself if she had some
good reason for wanting to go on living. She could find no reply,
replies do not always come when needed, and it often happens that the
only possible reply is to wait for them.</p>
<p>Along the route they were taking they would pass two blocks away from
the house where the old man with the black eye-patch had his bachelor
room, but they had already decided that they would travel on, there was
no food to be found there, clothing they do not need, books they cannot
read. The streets are full of blind people out searching for food. They
go in and out of shops, enter empty-handed and nearly always come out
empty-handed, then they debate among themselves the need or advantage of
leaving this district and going to forage elsewhere in the city, the big
problem is that, things being as they are, without running water, the
gas cylinders empty, as well as the danger of lighting fires inside the
houses, no cooking can be done, assuming that we would know where to
look for the salt, the oil and seasoning, were we to try and prepare a
few dishes with some hint of the flavours from the past, if there were
some greens, simply having them boiled would leave us satisfied, the
same being true of meat, apart from the usual rabbits and hens, dogs and
cats could be cooked if they could be caught, but since experience is
truly the mistress of life, even these animals, previously domesticated,
learned to mistrust caresses, they now hunt in packs and in packs they
defend themselves from being hunted down, and since, thanks be to God,
they still have eyes, they are better equipped to avoid danger, and to
attack if necessary. All these circumstances and reasons have led us to
conclude that the best food for humans is what is preserved in cans and
jars, not only because it is often already cooked, ready to be eaten,
but also because it is so much easier to transport and handy for
immediate use. It is true that on all these cans, jars and different
packets in which these products are sold there is a date beyond which it
could be risky to consume them and even dangerous in certain cases, but
popular wisdom was quick to put into circulation a saying to which in a
sense there is no answer, symmetrical with another saying no longer much
used, what the eyes do not see the heart does not grieve over, people
would now often say, eyes that do not see have a cast-iron stomach,
which explains why they eat so much rubbish. Heading the group, the
doctor’s wife makes a mental calculation of the food she still has in
reserve, there will be enough, if that, for one meal, without counting
the dog, but let him sort himself out with the means at his disposal,
the same means that served him so well to grab the hen by the neck and
cut off its voice and life. She will have at home, as you may remember,
and provided that no one has broken in, a reasonable quantity of
preserves, enough for a couple, but there are seven persons here who
have to be fed, her reserves will not last long, even if she were to
enforce strict rationing. Tomorrow, or within the next few days, she
will have to return to the underground storeroom of the supermarket, she
will have to decide whether to go alone or to ask her husband to
accompany her, or the first blind man who is younger and more agile, the
choice is between the possibility of carrying a larger quantity of food
and acting speedily, without forgetting the conditions of the retreat.
The rubbish on the streets, which appears to be twice as much since
yesterday, the human excrement, that from before semi-liquified by the
torrential downpour of rain, mushy or runny, the excrement being
evacuated at this very minute by these men and women as we pass, fills
the air with the most awful stench, like a dense mist through which it
is only possible to advance with enormous effort. In a square surrounded
by trees, with a statue in the middle, a pack of dogs is devouring a
man’s corpse. He must have died a short while ago, his limbs are not
rigid, as can be seen when the dogs shake them to tear from the bone the
flesh caught between their teeth. A crow hops around in search of an
opening to get close to the feast. The doctor’s wife averted her eyes,
but it was too late, the vomit rising from her entrails was
irresistible, twice, three times, as if her own still-living body were
being shaken by other dogs, the pack of absolute despair, this is as far
as I go, I want to die here. Her husband asked, What’s the matter, the
others bound together by the cord, drew closer, suddenly alarmed, What
happened, Did the food upset you, Something that was off, I don’t feel a
thing, Nor me, All the better for them, all they could hear was the
uproar from the dogs, the sudden and unexpected cawing of a crow, in the
upheaval one of the dogs had bitten its wing in passing, quite
unintentionally, then the doctor’s wife said, I couldn’t stop myself,
forgive me, but some of the dogs here are eating another dog. Are they
eating our dog, asked the boy with the squint, No, our dog as you call
him, is alive, and prowling around them but he keeps his distance. After
eating that hen, he can’t be very hungry, said the first blind man. Are
you feeling better, asked the doctor, Yes, let’s be on our way, The dog
isn’t ours, it simply latched on to us, it will probably stay behind now
with these other dogs, it may have stayed with them before, but it has
refound its friends, I want to do a poo, Here, I’ve got stomachache, it
hurts, complained the boy. He relieved himself on the spot as best he
could, the doctor’s wife vomited once more, but for other reasons. Then
they crossed the vast square and when they reached the shade of the
trees, the doctor’s wife looked back. More dogs had appeared and they
were already contesting what remained of the corpse. The dog of tears
arrived with its snout touching the ground as if it were following some
trail, a question of habit, for this time a simple glance was enough to
find the woman he was looking for.</p>
<p>The march continued, the house of the old man with the black eyepatch
was already some way behind them, now they are making their way along a
broad avenue with tall imposing buildings on either side. The cars here
are expensive, capacious and comfortable, which explains why so many
blind people are to be seen sleeping in them, and from all appearances,
an enormous limousine has actually been transformed into a permanent
home, probably because it was much easier to return to a car than to a
house, the occupants of this one must do what was done back there in
quarantine to find their bed, groping their way along and counting the
cars from the corner, twenty-seven, right-hand side, I’m back home. The
building at whose door the limousine is parked is a bank. The car had
brought the chairman of the board to the weekly plenary meeting, the
first to be held since the epidemic of white sickness had been declared,
and there had been no time to park it in the underground garage until
the meeting was over. The driver went blind just as the chairman was
about to enter the building by the main entrance as usual, he let out a
cry, we are referring to the driver, but he, meaning the chairman, did
not hear it. Moreover, attendance at the plenary board meeting would not
be as complete as its designation suggested, for during the last few
days some of the directors had gone blind. The chairman did not get
round to opening the session, the agenda of which had provided for a
discussion of measures to be taken in the event that all the directors
and their deputies went blind, and he was not even able to enter the
board-room for when the elevator was taking him up to the fifteenth
floor, between the ninth and the tenth floors to be exact, the electric
power was cut off, never to be restored. And since disasters never come
singly, at that same moment the electricians went blind who were
responsible for maintaining the internal power supply and consequently
that also of the generator, an old model, not automatic, that had long
been awaiting replacement, this resulted, as we said before, in the
elevator coming to a halt between the ninth and tenth floors. The
chairman saw the attendant who was accompanying him go blind, he himself
lost his sight an hour later, and since the power did not come back and
the cases of blindness inside the bank multiplied that day, in all
probability the two are still there, dead, needless to say, shut up in a
coffin of steel, and therefore happily safe from voracious dogs.</p>
<p>There being no witnesses, and if there were there is no evidence that
they were summoned to the post-mortems to tell us what happened, it is
understandable that someone should ask how it was possible to know that
these things happened so and not in some other manner, the reply to be
given is that all stories are like those about the creation of the
universe, no one was there, no one witnessed anything, yet everyone
knows what happened. The doctor’s wife had asked, What will have
happened to the banks, not that she was much concerned, despite having
entrusted her savings to one of them, she raised the question out of
simple curiosity, simply because she thought of it, nothing more, nor
did she expect anyone to make a reply such as, for example, In the
beginning, God created heaven and earth, the earth was without form and
empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters, instead of this what really happened
was that the old man with the black eyepatch said as they were
proceeding down the avenue, As far as I could judge when I still had an
eye to see, at first, it was pandemonium, the people, afraid of ending
up blind and unprovided for, raced to the banks to withdraw their money,
feeling that they ought to safeguard their future, and this is
understandable, if someone knows they will no longer be able to work,
the only remedy, for as long as they might last, is to have recourse to
the savings made in times of prosperity when long-term provisions were
made, assuming in fact that the people were prudent enough to build up
their savings little by little, the outcome of this precipitous run on
the banks was that within twenty-four hours some of the main banks were
facing ruin, the Government intervened to plead for calm and to appeal
to the civic conscience of citizens, ending the proclamation with the
solemn declaration that it would assume all the responsibilities and
duties resulting from this public calamity they were facing, but this
calming measure did not succeed in alleviating the crisis, not only
because people continued to go blind but also because those who could
still see were interested only in saving their precious money, in the
end, it was inevitable, the banks, bankrupt or otherwise, closed their
doors and sought police protection, it did them no good, between the
noisy crowds that gathered in front of the banks there were also
policemen in plain clothes who demanded what they had saved with so much
effort, and some, in order to demonstrate at will, had even advised
their command that they were blind and were therefore dismissed, and the
others, still in uniform and on active service, their weapons trained on
the dissatisfied masses, suddenly lost sight of their target, the
latter, if they had money in the bank, lost all hope and, as if that
were not enough, they were accused of having entered into a pact with
the established authority, but there was worse to come when the banks
found themselves attacked by furious hordes of whom some were blind and
others not, but all of them desperate, here it was no longer a question
of calmly handing in a cheque to be cashed at the counter and saying to
the teller, I wish to withdraw my savings, but to lay hands on
everything possible, on the cash in the till, whatever had been left in
some drawer or other, in some safe-deposit box carelessly left open, in
some old-fashioned money-bag as used by the grandparents of an older
generation, you cannot imagine what it was like, the vast and sumptuous
halls of the head office, the smaller branch offices in various
districts witnessed truly terrifying scenes, nor should we forget the
automatic tills, forced open and stripped of the very last note, on the
screen of some of them appeared an enigmatic message of thanks for
having chosen this bank. Machines are really very stupid, it might be
more precise to say that these machines had betrayed their owners, in a
word, the whole banking system collapsed, blown over like a house of
cards, and not because the possession of money had ceased to be
appreciated, the proof being that anyone who has it does not want to let
go of it, the latter allege that no one can foresee what will happen
tomorrow, this no doubt also being in the thoughts of the blind people
who installed themselves in the vaults of the banks, where the
strong-boxes are kept, waiting for some miracle to open wide those heavy
metal doors that separate them from this wealth, they leave the place
only to go in search of food and water or to satisfy the body’s other
needs, and then return to their post, they have passwords and hand signs
so that no stranger may penetrate their stronghold, needless to say they
live in total darkness, not that it matters, in this particular
blindness everything is white. The old man with the black eyepatch
related these tremendous happenings about banks and finance as they
slowly crossed the city, with the odd stop so that the boy with the
squint might pacify the unbearable turmoil in his intestines, and,
despite the persuasive tone he gave to this impassioned description, it
is logical to suspect that there was some exaggeration in his account,
the story about the blind people who live in the bank vaults, for
example, how could he have known if he does not know the password or the
hand signal, in any case it was enough to give us some idea.</p>
<p>The light was fading when they finally arrived in the street where
the doctor and his wife live. It is no different from the others, there
is squalor everywhere, groups of blind people wandering aimlessly about,
and, for the first time, but it was mere chance that they had not
encountered them before, two huge rats, even the cats avoid them as they
go on the prowl, for they are almost as big as they are and in all
certainty much more ferocious. The dog of tears looked at both the rats
and the cats with the indifference of someone who lives in another
sphere of emotions, this we might say, were it not for the fact that the
dog continues to be the dog that he is, an animal of the human type. At
the sight of familiar places, the doctor’s wife did not make the usual
melancholy reflection, that consists in saying, How time passes, only
the other day we were happy here, what shocked her was the
disappointment, she had unwittingly believed that, being hers, she would
find the street clean, swept, tidy, that her neighbours would be blind
in their eyes, but not in their understanding, How stupid of me, she
said aloud, Why, what is wrong, asked her husband, Nothing, daydreams,
How time passes, what will the flat be like, he wondered, We’ll soon
find out. They did not have much strength, and so climbed the stairs
very slowly, pausing for breath on each landing, It’s on the fifth
floor, the doctor’s wife had said. They went up as best they could, each
under his or her own steam, the dog of tears now in front, now behind,
as if it had been born to guide a flock, under orders not to lose a
single sheep. There were open doors, voices within, the usual foul odour
wafting out, twice blind people ap peared on the threshold and looked
with vacant eyes, Who’s there, they asked, the doctor’s wife recognised
one of the voices, the other voice was not that of someone who lived in
the building. We used to live here, was all she said. A flicker of
recognition also showed on her neighbour’s face, but she did not ask,
Are you the doctor’s wife, perhaps she might say once back inside, The
people from the fifth floor are back. On reaching the last flight of
stairs, even before setting foot on the landing, the doctor’s wife was
already announcing, The door is locked. There were signs of an attempt
at a forced entry but the door had withstood the assault. The doctor put
his hand into the inside pocket of his new jacket and brought out the
keys. He held them in mid-air, waiting, but his wife gently guided his
hand towards the keyhole.</p>
