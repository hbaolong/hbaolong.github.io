<h4 id="section">2</h4>
<p>On offering to help the blind man, the man who then stole his car,
had not, at that precise moment, had any evil intention, quite the
contrary, what he did was nothing more than to obey those feelings of
generosity and altruism which, as everyone knows, are the two best
traits of human nature and to be found in much more hardened criminals
than this one, a simple car-thief without any hope of advancing in his
profession, exploited by the real owners of this enterprise, for it is
they who take advantage of the needs of the poor. When all is said and
done, there is not all that much difference between helping a blind man
only to rob him afterwards and looking after some tottering and
stammering old person with one eye on the inheritance. It was only when
he got close to the blind man’s home that the idea came to him quite
naturally, precisely, one might say, as if he had decided to buy a
lottery ticket on catching sight of a ticket-vendor, he had no hunch, he
bought the ticket to see what might come of it, resigned in advance to
whatever capricious fortune might bring, something or nothing, others
would say that he acted according to a conditioned reflex of his
personality. The sceptics, who are many and stubborn, claim that, when
it comes to human nature, if it is true that the opportunity does not
always make the thief, it is also true that it helps a lot. As for us,
we should like to think that if the blind man had accepted the second
offer of this false Samaritan, at that final moment generosity might
still have prevailed, we refer to his offer to keep the blind man
company until his wife should arrive, who knows whether the moral
responsibility, resulting from the trust thus bestowed, might not have
inhibited the criminal temptation and caused the victory of those
shining and noble sentiments which it is always possible to find even in
the most depraved souls. To finish on a plebeian note, as the old
proverb never tires of teaching us, while trying to cross himself the
blind man only succeeded in breaking his own nose.</p>
<p>The moral conscience that so many thoughtless people have offended
against and many more have rejected, is something that exists and has
always existed, it was not an invention of the philosophers of the
Quaternary, when the soul was little more than a muddled proposition.
With the passing of time, as well as the social evolution and genetic
exchange, we ended up putting our conscience in the colour of blood and
in the salt of tears, and, as if that were not enough, we made our eyes
into a kind of mirror turned inwards, with the result that they often
show without reserve what we are verbally trying to deny. Add to this
general observation, the particular circumstance that in simple spirits,
the remorse caused by committing some evil act often becomes confused
with ancestral fears of every kind, and the result will be that the
punishment of the prevaricator ends up being, without mercy or pity,
twice what he deserved. In this case it is, therefore, impossible to
unravel what proportion of fear and what proportion of the afflicted
conscience began to harass the thief the moment he started up the engine
of the car and drove off. No doubt he could never feel tranquil sitting
in the place of someone who was holding this same steering wheel when he
suddenly turned blind, who looked through this windshield and suddenly
could no longer see, it does not take much imagination for such thoughts
to rouse the foul and insidious monster of fear, there it is already
raising its head. But it was also remorse, the aggrieved expression of
one’s conscience, as already stated, or, if we prefer to describe it in
suggestive terms, a conscience with teeth to bite, that was about to put
before his eyes the forlorn image of the blind man as he was closing the
door, There’s no need, there’s no need, the poor fellow had said, and
from then on he would not be capable of taking a step without
assistance.</p>
<p>The thief concentrated twice as hard on the traffic to prevent such
terrifying thoughts from fully occupying his mind, he knew full well
that he could not permit himself the smallest error, the tiniest
distraction. There were always police around and it would only need one
of them to stop him, May I see your identity card and driving licence,
back to prison, what a hard life. He was most careful to obey the
traffic lights, under no circumstances to go when the light was red, to
respect the amber light, to wait patiently for the green light to come
on. At a certain point, he realised that he had started to look at the
lights in a way that was becoming obsessive. He then started to regulate
the speed of the car to ensure that he always had a green light before
him, even if, in order to ensure this, he had to increase the speed or,
on the contrary, to reduce it to the extent of irritating the drivers
behind him. In the end, disoriented as he was, tense beyond endurance,
he drove the car into a minor road where he knew there were no traffic
lights, and parked almost without looking, he was such a good driver. He
felt as if his nerves were about to explode, these were the very words
that crossed his mind. My nerves are about to explode. It was stifling
inside the car. He lowered the windows on either side, but the air
outside, if it was moving, did nothing to freshen the atmosphere inside.
What am I going to do, he asked himself. The shed where he had to take
the car was far away, in a village outside the city, and in his present
frame of mind, he would never get there. Either the police will arrest
me or, worse still, I’ll have an accident, he muttered. It then occurred
to him that it would be best to get out of the car for a bit and try to
clear his thoughts, Perhaps the fresh air will blow the cobwebs away,
just because that poor wretch turned blind is no reason why the same
should happen to me, this is not some cold one catches, I’ll take a turn
round the block and it will pass. He got out and did not bother to lock
the car, he would be back in a minute, and walked off. He had gone no
more than thirty paces when he went blind.</p>
<p>In the surgery, the last patient to be seen was the good-natured old
man, the one who had spoken so kindly about the poor man who had
suddenly turned blind. He was there just to arrange a date for an
operation on a cataract that had appeared in his one remaining eye, the
black patch was covering a void, and had nothing to do with the matter
in hand, These are ailments that come with old age, the doctor had said
some time ago, when it matures we shall remove it, then you won’t
recognise the place you’ve been living in. When the old man with the
black eyepatch left and the nurse said there were no more patients in
the waiting-room, the doctor took out the file of the man who had turned
up blind, he read it once, twice, reflected for several minutes and
finally rang a colleague with whom he held the following conversation: I
must tell you, today I dealt with the strangest case, a man who totally
lost his sight from one instant to the next, the examination revealed no
perceptible lesion or signs of any malformation from birth, he says he
sees everything white, a kind of thick, milky whiteness that clings to
his eyes, I’m trying to explain as best I can how he described it, yes,
of course it’s subjective, no, the man is relatively young, thirty-eight
years old, have you ever heard of such a case, or read about it, or
heard it mentioned, I thought as much, for the moment I cannot think of
any solution, to gain time I’ve recommended some tests, yes, we could
examine him together one of these days, after dinner I shall check some
books, take another look at the bibliography, perhaps I’ll find some
clue, yes, I’m familiar with agnosia, it could be psychic blindness, but
then it would be the first case with these characteristics, because
there is no doubt that the man is really blind, and as we know, agnosia
is the inability to recognise familiar objects, because it also occurred
to me that this might be a case of amaurosis, but remember what I
started to tell you, this blindness is white, precisely the opposite of
amaurosis which is total darkness unless there is some form of white
amaurosis, a white darkness, as it were, yes, I know, something unheard
of, agreed, I’ll call him tomorrow, explain that we should like to
examine him together. Having ended his conversation, the doctor leaned
back in his chair, remained there for a few minutes, then rose to his
feet, removed his white coat with slow, weary movements. He went to the
bathroom to wash his hands, but this time he did not ask the mirror,
metaphysically, What can this be, he had recovered his scientific
outlook, the fact that agnosia and amaurosis are identified and defined
with great precision in books and in practice, did not preclude the
appearance of variations, mutations, if the word is appropriate, and
that day seemed to have arrived. There are a thousand reasons why the
brain should close up, just this, and nothing else, like a late visitor
arriving to find his own door shut. The ophthalmologist was a man with a
taste for literature and a flair for coming up with the right
quotation.</p>
<p>That evening, after dinner, he told his wife, A strange case turned
up at the surgery today, it might be a variant of psychic blindness or
amaurosis, but there appears to be no evidence of any such symptoms ever
having been established, What are these illnesses, amaurosis and that
other thing, his wife asked him. The doctor gave an explanation within
the grasp of a layman and capable of satisfying her curiosity, then he
went to the bookcase where he kept his medical books, some dating back
to his university years, others more recent and some just published
which he still had not had time to study. He checked the indexes and
methodically began reading everything he could find about agnosia and
amaurosis, with the uncomfortable impression of being an intruder in a
field beyond his competence, the mysterious terrain of neurosurgery,
about which he only had the vaguest notion. Late that night, he laid
aside the books he had been studying, rubbed his weary eyes and leaned
back in his chair. At that moment the alternative presented itself as
clear as could be. If it were a case of agnosia, the patient would now
be seeing what he had always seen, that is to say, there would have been
no diminution of his visual powers, his brain would simply have been
incapable of recognising a chair wherever there happened to be a chair,
in other words, he would continue to react correctly to the luminous
stimuli leading to the optic nerve, but, to use simple terms within the
grasp of the layman, he would have lost the capacity to know what he
knew and, moreover, to express it. As for amaurosis, here there was no
doubt. For this to be effectively the case, the patient would have to
see everything black, if you’ll excuse the use of the verb to see, when
this was a case of total darkness. The blind man had categorically
stated that he could see, if you’ll excuse that verb again, a thick,
uniform white colour as if he had plunged with open eyes into a milky
sea. A white amaurosis, apart from being etymologically a contradiction,
would also be a neurological impossibility, since the brain, which would
be unable to perceive the images, forms and colours of reality, would
likewise be incapable, in a manner of speaking, of being covered in
white, a continuous white, like a white painting without tonalities, the
colours, forms and images that reality itself might present to someone
with normal vision, however difficult it may be to speak, with any
accuracy, of normal vision. With the clear conscience of having fetched
up in a dead end, the doctor shook his head despondently and looked
around him. His wife had already gone off to bed, he vaguely remembered
her coming up to him for a moment and kissing him on the head, I’m off
to bed, she must have told him, the flat was now silent, books scattered
on the table, What’s this, he thought to himself, and suddenly he felt
afraid, as if he himself were about to turn blind any minute now and he
already knew it. He held his breath and waited. Nothing happened. It
happened a minute later as he was gathering up the books to return them
to the bookshelf. First he perceived that he could no longer see his
hands, then he knew he was blind.</p>
<p>The ailment of the girl with dark glasses was not serious, she was
suffering from a mild form of conjunctivitis which the drops prescribed
by the doctor would clear up in no time, You know what to do, for the
next few days you should remove your glasses only when you sleep, he had
told her. He had been cracking the same joke for years, we might even
assume that it had been handed down from one generation of
ophthalmologists to another, but it never failed, the doctor was smiling
as he spoke, the patient smiled as she listened, and on this occasion it
was worthwhile, because the girl had nice teeth and knew how to show
them. Out of natural misanthropy or because of too many disappointments
in life, any ordinary sceptic, familiar with the details of this woman’s
life, would insinuate that the prettiness of her smile was no more than
a trick of the trade, a wicked and gratuitous assertion, because she had
the same smile even as a toddler, a word no longer much in use, when her
future was a closed book and the curiosity of opening it had not yet
been born. To put it simply, this woman could be classed as a
prostitute, but the complexity in the web of social relationships,
whether by day or night, vertical or horizontal, of the period here
described cautions us to avoid a tendency to make hasty and definitive
judgments, a mania which, owing to our ex aggerated self-confidence, we
shall perhaps never be rid of. Although it may be evident just how much
cloud there is in Juno, it is not entirely licit, to insist on confusing
with a Greek goddess what is no more than an ordinary concentration of
drops of water hovering in the atmosphere. Without any doubt, this woman
goes to bed with men in exchange for money, a fact that might allow us
to classify her without further consideration as a prostitute, but,
since it is also true that she goes with a man only when she feels like
it and with whom she wants to, we cannot dismiss the possibility that
such a factual difference, must as a precaution determine her exclusion
from the club as a whole. She has, like ordinary people, a profession,
and, also like ordinary people, she takes advantage of any free time to
indulge her body and satisfy needs, both individual and general. Were we
not trying to reduce her to some primary definition, we should finally
say of her, in the broad sense, that she lives as she pleases and
moreover gets all the pleasure she can from life.</p>
<p>It was already dark when she left the surgery. She did not remove her
glasses, the street lighting disturbed her, especially the illuminated
ads. She went into a chemist to buy the drops the doctor had prescribed,
decided to pay no attention when the man who served her commented how
unfair it was that certain eyes should be covered by dark glasses, an
observation that besides being impertinent in itself, and coming from a
pharmacist’s assistant if you please, went against her belief that dark
glasses gave her an air of alluring mystery, capable of arousing the
interest of men who were passing, to which she might reciprocate, were
it not for the fact that today she had someone waiting for her, an
encounter she had every reason to expect would lead to something good,
as much in terms of material as in terms of other satisfactions. The man
she was about to meet was an old acquaintance, he did not mind when she
warned him she could not remove her glasses, an order, moreover, the
doctor had not as yet given, and the man even found it amusing,
something different. On leaving the pharmacy the girl hailed a taxi,
gave the name of a hotel. Reclining on the seat, she was already
savouring, if the term is appropriate, the various and multiple
sensations of sensuous pleasure, from that first, knowing contact of
lips, from that first intimate caress, to the successive explosions of
an orgasm that would leave her exhausted and happy, as if she were about
to be crucified, heaven protect us, in a dazzling and vertiginous
firework. So we have every reason to conclude that the girl with dark
glasses, if her partner has known how to fulfill his obligation, in
terms of perfect timing and technique, always pays in advance and twice
as much as she later charges. Lost in these thoughts, no doubt because
she had just paid for a consultation, she asked herself whether it would
not be a good idea to raise, starting from today, what, with cheerful
euphemism, she was wont to describe as her just level of
compensation.</p>
<p>She ordered the taxi-driver to stop one block before her destination,
mingled with the people who were following in the same direction, as if
allowing herself to be carried along by them, anonymous and without any
outward sign of guilt or shame. She entered the hotel with a natural
air, crossed the vestibule in the direction of the bar. She had arrived
a few minutes early, therefore she had to wait, the hour of their
meeting had been arranged with precision. She asked for a soft drink,
which she drank at her leisure, without looking at anyone for she did
not wish to be mistaken for a common whore in pursuit of men. A little
later, like a tourist going up to her room to rest after having spent
the afternoon in the museums, she headed for the elevator. Virtue,
should there be anyone who still ignores the fact, always finds pitfalls
on the extremely difficult path of perfection, but sin and vice are so
favoured by fortune that no sooner did she get there than the elevator
door opened. Two guests got out, an elderly couple, she stepped inside,
pressed the button for the third floor, three hundred and twelve was the
number awaiting her, it is here, she discreetly knocked on the door, ten
minutes later she was naked, fifteen minutes later she was moaning,
eighteen minutes later she was whispering words of love that she no
longer needed to feign, after twenty minutes she began to lose her head,
after twenty-one minutes she felt that her body was being lacerated with
pleasure, after twenty-two minutes she called out, Now, now, and when
she regained consciousness she said, exhausted and happy, I can still
see everything white.</p>
