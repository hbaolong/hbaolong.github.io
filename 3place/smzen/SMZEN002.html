<h4 id="section">1</h4>
<p>The amber light came on. Two of the cars ahead accelerated before the
red light appeared. At the pedestrian crossing the sign of a green man
lit up. The people who were waiting began to cross the road, stepping on
the white stripes painted on the black surface of the asphalt, there is
nothing less like a zebra, however, that is what it is called. The
motorists kept an impatient foot on the clutch, leaving their cars at
the ready, advancing, retreating like nervous horses that can sense the
whiplash about to be inflicted. The pedestrians have just finished
crossing but the sign allowing the cars to go will be delayed for some
seconds, some people maintain that this delay, while apparently so
insignificant, has only to be multiplied by the thousands of traffic
lights that exist in the city and by the successive changes of their
three colours to produce one of the most serious causes of traffic jams
or bottlenecks, to use the more current term.</p>
<p>The green light came on at last, the cars moved off briskly, but then
it became clear that not all of them were equally quick off the mark.
The car at the head of the middle lane has stopped, there must be some
mechanical fault, a loose accelerator pedal, a gear lever that has
stuck, problem with the suspension, jammed brakes, breakdown in the
electric circuit, unless he has simply run out of gas, it would not be
the first time such a thing has happened. The next group of pedestrians
to gather at the crossing see the driver of the stationary car wave his
arms behind the windshield, while the cars behind him frantically sound
their horns. Some drivers have already got out of their cars, prepared
to push the stranded vehicle to a spot where it will not hold up the
traffic, they beat furiously on the closed windows, the man inside turns
his head in their direction, first to one side then the other, he is
clearly shouting something, to judge by the movements of his mouth he
appears to be repeating some words, not one word but three, as turns out
to be the case when someone finally manages to open the door, I am
blind.</p>
<p>Who would have believed it. Seen merely at a glance, the man’s eyes
seem healthy, the iris looks bright, luminous, the sclera white, as
compact as porcelain. The eyes wide open, the wrinkled skin of the face,
his eyebrows suddenly screwed up, all this, as anyone can see, signifies
that he is distraught with anguish. With a rapid movement, what was in
sight has disappeared behind the man’s clenched fists, as if he were
still trying to retain inside his mind the final image captured, a round
red light at the traffic lights. I am blind, I am blind, he repeated in
despair as they helped him to get out of the car, and the tears welling
up made those eyes which he claimed were dead, shine even more. These
things happen, it will pass you’ll see, sometimes it’s nerves, said a
woman. The lights had already changed again, some inquisitive passersby
had gathered around the group, and the drivers further back who did not
know what was going on, protested at what they thought was some common
accident, a smashed headlight, a dented fender, nothing to justify this
upheaval, Call the police, they shouted and get that old wreck out of
the way. The blind man pleaded, Please, will someone take me home. The
woman who had suggested a case of nerves was of the opinion that an
ambulance should be summoned to transport the poor man to the hospital,
but the blind man refused to hear of it, quite unnecessary, all he
wanted was that someone might accompany him to the entrance of the
building where he lived. It’s close by and you could do me no greater
favour. And what about the car, asked someone. Another voice replied,
The key is in the ignition, drive the car on to the pavement. No need,
intervened a third voice, I’ll take charge of the car and accompany this
man home. There were murmurs of approval. The blind man felt himself
being taken by the arm, Come, come with me, the same voice was saying to
him. They eased him into the front passenger seat, and secured the
safety belt. I can’t see, I can’t see, he murmured, still weeping. Tell
me where you live, the man asked him. Through the car windows voracious
faces spied, avid for some news. The blind man raised his hands to his
eyes and gestured, Nothing, it’s as if I were caught in a mist or had
fallen into a milky sea. But blindness isn’t like that, said the other
fellow, they say that blindness is black, Well I see everything white,
That little woman was probably right, it could be a matter of nerves,
nerves are the very devil, No need to talk to me about it, it’s a
disaster, yes a disaster, Tell me where you live please, and at the same
time the engine started up. Faltering, as if his lack of sight had
weakened his memory, the blind man gave his address, then he said, I
have no words to thank you, and the other replied, Now then, don’t give
it another thought, today it’s your turn, tomorrow it will be mine, we
never know what might lie in store for us, You’re right, who would have
thought, when I left the house this morning, that something as dreadful
as this was about to happen. He was puzzled that they should still be at
a standstill, Why aren’t we moving, he asked, The light is on red,
replied the other. From now on he would no longer know when the light
was red.</p>
<p>As the blind man had said, his home was nearby. But the pavements
were crammed with vehicles, they could not find a space to park and were
obliged to look for a spot in one of the side streets. There, because of
the narrowness of the pavement, the door on the passenger’s side would
have been little more than a hand’s-breadth from the wall, so in order
to avoid the discomfort of dragging himself from one seat to the other
with the brake and steering wheel in the way, the blind man had to get
out before the car was parked. Abandoned in the middle of the road,
feeling the ground shifting under his feet, he tried to suppress the
sense of panic that welled up inside him. He waved his hands in front of
his face, nervously, as if he were swimming in what he had described as
a milky sea, but his mouth was already opening to let out a cry for help
when at the last minute he felt the other’s hand gently touch him on the
arm, Calm down, I’ve got you. They proceeded very slowly, afraid of
falling, the blind man dragged his feet, but this caused him to stumble
on the uneven pavement, Be patient, we’re almost there, the other
murmured, and a little further ahead, he asked, Is there anyone at home
to look after you, and the blind man replied, I don’t know, my wife
won’t be back from work yet, today it so happened that I left earlier
only to have this hit me. You’ll see, it isn’t anything serious, I’ve
never heard of anyone suddenly going blind, And to think I used to boast
that I didn’t even need glasses, Well it just goes to show. They had
arrived at the entrance to the building, two women from the
neighbourhood looked on inquisitively at the sight of their neighbour
being led by the arm but neither of them thought of asking, Have you got
something in your eye, it never occurred to them nor would he have been
able to reply, Yes, a milky sea. Once inside the building, the blind man
said, Many thanks, I’m sorry for all the trouble I’ve caused you, I can
manage on my own now, No need to apologise, I’ll come up with you, I
wouldn’t be easy in my mind if I were to leave you here. They got into
the narrow elevator with some difficulty, What floor do you live on, On
the third, you cannot imagine how grateful I am, Don’t thank me, today
it’s you, Yes, you’re right, tomorrow it might be you. The elevator came
to a halt, they stepped out on to the landing, Would you like me to help
you open the door, Thanks, that’s something I think I can do for myself.
He took from his pocket a small bunch of keys, felt them one by one
along the serrated edge, and said, It must be this one, and feeling for
the keyhole with the fingertips of his left hand, he tried to open the
door. It isn’t this one, Let me have a look, I’ll help you. The door
opened at the third attempt. Then the blind man called inside, Are you
there, no one replied, and he remarked, Just as I was saying, she still
hasn’t come back. Stretching out his hands, he groped his way along the
corridor, then he came back cautiously, turning his head in the
direction where he calculated the other fellow would be, How can I thank
you, he said, It was the least I could do, said the good Samaritan, no
need to thank me, and added, Do you want me to help you to get settled
and keep you company until your wife arrives. This zeal suddenly struck
the blind man as being suspect, obviously he would not invite a complete
stranger to come in who, after all, might well be plotting at that very
moment how to overcome, tie up and gag the poor defenceless blind man,
and then lay hands on anything of value. There’s no need, please don’t
bother, he said, I’m fine, and as he slowly began closing the door, he
repeated, There’s no need, there’s no need.</p>
<p>Hearing the sound of the elevator descending he gave a sigh of
relief. With a mechanical gesture, forgetting the state in which he
found himself, he drew back the lid of the peep-hole and looked outside.
It was as if there were a white wall on the other side. He could feel
the contact of the metallic frame on his eyebrow, his eyelashes brushed
against the tiny lens, but he could not see out, an impenetrable
whiteness covered everything. He knew he was in his own home, he
recognised the smell, the atmosphere, the silence, he could make out the
items of furniture and objects simply by touching them, lightly running
his fingers over them, but at the same time it was as if all of this
were already dissolving into a kind of strange dimension, without
direction or reference points, with neither north nor south, below nor
above. Like most people, he had often played as a child at pretending to
be blind, and, after keeping his eyes closed for five minutes, he had
reached the conclusion that blindness, undoubtedly a terrible
affliction, might still be relatively bearable if the unfortunate victim
had retained sufficient memory, not just of the colours, but also of
forms and planes, surfaces and shapes, assuming of course, that this one
was not born blind. He had even reached the point of thinking that the
darkness in which the blind live was nothing other than the simple
absence of light, that what we call blindness was something that simply
covered the appearance of beings and things, leaving them intact behind
their black veil. Now, on the contrary, here he was, plunged into a
whiteness so luminous, so total, that it swallowed up rather than
absorbed, not just the colours, but the very things and beings, thus
making them twice as invisible.</p>
<p>As he moved in the direction of the sitting-room, despite the caution
with which he advanced, running a hesitant hand along the wall and not
anticipating any obstacles, he sent a vase of flowers crashing to the
floor. He had forgotten about any such vase, or perhaps his wife had put
it there when she left for work with the intention of later finding some
more suitable place. He bent down to appraise the damage. The water had
spread over the polished floor. He tried to gather up the flowers, never
thinking of the broken glass, a long sharp splinter pricked his finger
and, at the pain, childish tears of helplessness sprang to his eyes,
blind with whiteness in the middle of his flat, which was turning dark
as evening fell. Still clutching the flowers and feeling the blood
running down, he twisted round to get the handkerchief from his pocket
and wrapped it round his finger as best he could. Then, fumbling,
stumbling, skirting the furniture, treading warily so as not to trip on
the rugs, he reached the sofa where he and his wife watched television.
He sat down, rested the flowers on his lap, and, with the utmost care,
unrolled the handkerchief. The blood, sticky to the touch, worried him,
he thought it must be because he could not see it, his blood had turned
into a viscous substance without colour, into something rather alien
which nevertheless belonged to him, but like a self-inflicted threat
directed at himself. Very slowly, gently probing with his good hand, he
tried to locate the splinter of glass, as sharp as a tiny dagger, and,
by bringing the nails of his thumb and forefinger together, he managed
to extract all of it. He wrapped the handkerchief round the injured
finger once more, this time tightly to stop the bleeding, and, weak and
exhausted, he leaned back on the sofa. A minute later, because of one of
those all too common abdications of the body, that chooses to give up in
certain moments of anguish or despair, when, if it were guided by logic
alone, all its nerves should be alert and tense, a kind of weariness
crept over him, more drowsiness than real fatigue, but just as heavy. He
dreamt at once that he was pretending to be blind, he dreamt that he was
forever closing and opening his eyes, and that, on each occasion, as if
he were returning from a journey, he found waiting for him, firm and
unaltered, all the forms and colours of the world as he knew it. Beneath
this reassuring certainty, he perceived nevertheless, the dull nagging
of uncertainty, perhaps it was a deceptive dream, a dream from which he
would have to emerge sooner or later, without knowing at this moment
what reality awaited him. Then, if such a word has any meaning when
applied to a weariness that lasted for only a few seconds, and already
in that semi-vigilant state that prepares one for awakening, he
seriously considered that it was unwise to remain in this state of
indecision, shall I wake up, shall I not wake up, shall I wake up, shall
I not wake up, there always comes a moment when one has no option but to
take a risk, What am I doing here with these flowers on my lap and my
eyes closed as if I were afraid of opening them, What are you doing
there, sleeping with those flowers on your lap, his wife was asking
him.</p>
<p>She did not wait for a reply. Pointedly, she set about gathering up
the fragments of the vase and drying the floor, muttering all the while
with an irritation she made no attempt to disguise, You might have
cleaned up this mess yourself, instead of settling down to sleep as if
it were no concern of yours. He said nothing, protecting his eyes behind
tightly closed lids, suddenly agitated by a thought, And if I were to
open my eyes and see, he asked himself, gripped by anxious hope. The
woman drew near, noticed the bloodstained handkerchief, her vexation
gone in an instant, Poor man, how did this happen, she asked
compassionately as she undid the improvised bandage. Then he wanted with
all his strength to see his wife kneeling at his feet, right there,
where he knew she was, and then, certain that he would not see her, he
opened his eyes, So you’ve wakened up at last, my sleepyhead, she said
smiling. There was silence, and he said, I’m blind, I can’t see. The
woman lost her patience, Stop playing silly games, there are certain
things we must not joke about, How I wish it were a joke, the truth is
that I really am blind, I can’t see anything, Please, don’t frighten me,
look at me, here, I’m here, the light is on, I know you’re there, I can
hear you, touch you, I can imagine you’ve switched on the light, but I
am blind. She began to weep, clung to him, It isn’t true, tell me that
it isn’t true. The flowers had slipped onto the floor, onto the
bloodstained handkerchief, the blood had started to trickle again from
the injured finger, and he, as if wanting to say with other words,
That’s the least of my worries, murmured, I see everything white, and he
gave a sad smile. The woman sat down beside him, embraced him tightly,
kissed him gently on the forehead, on the face, softly on the eyes,
You’ll see that this will pass, you haven’t been ill, no one goes blind
from one minute to the next, Perhaps, Tell me how it happened, what did
you feel, when, where, no, not yet, wait, the first thing we must do is
to consult an eye specialist, can you think of one, I’m afraid not,
neither of us wears glasses, And if I were to take you to the hospital,
There isn’t likely to be any emergency service for eyes that cannot see,
You’re right, better that we should go straight to a doctor, I’ll look
in the telephone directory and locate a doctor who practises nearby. She
got up, still questioning him, Do you notice any difference, None, he
replied, Pay attention, I’m going to switch off the light and you can
tell me, now, Nothing, What do you mean nothing, Nothing, I always see
the same white, it’s as if there were no night.</p>
<p>He could hear his wife rapidly leaf through the pages of the
telephone directory, sniffling to hold back her tears, sighing, and
finally saying, This one will do, let’s hope he can see us. She dialled
a number, asked if that was the surgery, if the doctor was there, if she
could speak to him, No, no the doctor doesn’t know me, the matter is
extremely urgent, yes, please, I understand, then I’ll explain the
situation to you, but I beg of you to pass on what I have to say to the
doctor, the fact is that my husband has suddenly gone blind, yes, yes,
all of a sudden, no, no he is not one of the doctor’s patients, my
husband does not wear glasses and never has, yes, he has excellent
eyesight, just like me, I also see perfectly well, ah, many thanks, I’ll
wait, I’ll wait, yes, doctor, all of a sudden, he says he sees
everything white, I have no idea what happened, I haven’t had time to
ask him, I’ve just arrived home to find him in this state, would you
like me to ask him, ah, I’m so grateful to you doctor, we’ll come right
away, right away. The blind man rose to his feet, Wait, his wife said,
first let me attend to this finger, she disappeared for several moments,
came back with a bottle of peroxide, another of iodine, cotton wool, a
box of bandages. As she dressed the wound, she asked him, Where did you
leave the car, and suddenly confronted him, But in your condition you
couldn’t have driven the car, or you were already at home when it
happened, No, it was on the street when I was stationary at a red light,
some person brought me home, the car was left in the next street, Fine,
let’s go down, wait at the door while I go to find it, where did you put
the keys, I don’t know, he never gave them back to me, Who’s he, The man
who brought me home, it was a man, He must have left them somewhere,
I’ll have a look round, It’s pointless searching, he didn’t enter the
flat, But the keys have to be somewhere, Most likely he forgot,
inadvertently took them with him, This was all we needed, Use your keys,
then we’ll sort it out, Right, let’s go, take my hand. The blind man
said, If I have to stay like this, I’d rather be dead, Please, don’t
talk nonsense, things are bad enough, I’m the one who’s blind, not you,
you cannot imagine what it’s like, The doctor will come up with some
remedy, you’ll see, I shall see.</p>
<p>They left. Below, in the lobby, his wife switched on the light and
whispered in his ear. Wait for me here, if any neighbours should appear
speak to them naturally, say you’re waiting for me, no one looking at
you would ever suspect that you cannot see and besides we don’t have to
tell people all our business, Yes, but don’t be long. His wife went
rushing off. No neighbour entered or left. The blind man knew from
experience that the stairway would only be lit so long as he could hear
the mechanism of the automatic switch, therefore he went on pressing the
button whenever there was silence. The light, this light, had been
transformed into noise for him. He could not understand why his wife was
taking so long to return, the street was nearby, some eighty or a
hundred metres, If we delay any longer, the doctor will be gone, he
thought to himself. He could not avoid a mechanical gesture, raising his
left wrist and lowering his eyes to look at his watch. He pursed his
lips as if in sudden pain, and felt deeply grateful that there were no
neighbours around at that moment, for there and then, were anyone to
have spoken to him, he would have burst into tears. A car stopped in the
street, At last, he thought, but then realised that it was not the sound
of his car engine, This is a diesel engine, it must be a taxi, he said,
pressing once more on the button for the light. His wife came back,
flustered and upset, that good Samaritan of yours, that good soul, has
taken our car, It isn’t possible, you can’t have looked properly, Of
course I looked properly, there’s nothing wrong with my eyesight, these
last words came out inadvertently, You told me the car was in the next
street, she corrected herself, and it isn’t, unless they’ve left it in
some other street, No, no, I’m certain it was left in this street, Well
then it has disappeared, In that case, what about the keys, He took
advantage of your confusion and distress and robbed us, And to think I
didn’t want him in the flat for fear he might steal something yet if he
had kept me company until you arrived home, he could not have stolen our
car, Let’s go, we have a taxi waiting, I swear to you that I’d give a
year of my life to see this rogue go blind as well. Don’t speak so loud,
And that they rob him of everything he possesses, He might turn up, Ah,
so you think he’ll knock on the door tomorrow and say he took the car in
a moment of distraction, that he is sorry and inquire if you’re feeling
better.</p>
<p>They remained silent until they reached the doctor’s surgery. She
tried not to think about the stolen car, squeezed her husband’s hand
affectionately, while he, his head lowered so that the driver would not
see his eyes through the rear-view mirror, could not stop asking himself
how it was possible that such a terrible tragedy should have befallen
him, Why me. He could hear the noise of the traffic, the odd loud voice
whenever the taxi stopped, it often happens, we are still asleep and
external sounds are already penetrating the veil of unconsciousness in
which we are still wrapped up, as in a white sheet. As in a white sheet.
He shook his head, sighing, his wife gently stroked his cheek, her way
of saying, Keep calm, I’m here, and he leaned his head on her shoulder,
indifferent to what the driver might think, If you were in my situation
and unable to drive any more, he thought childishly, and oblivious of
the absurdity of that remark, he congratulated himself amidst his
despair that he was still capable of formulating a rational thought. On
leaving the taxi, discreetly assisted by his wife, he seemed calm, but
on entering the surgery where he was about to learn his fate, he asked
his wife in a tremulous whisper, What will I be like when I get out of
this place, and he shook his head as if he had given up all hope.</p>
<p>His wife informed the receptionist, I’m the person who rang half an
hour ago because of my husband, and the receptionist showed them into a
small room where other patients were waiting. There was an old man with
a black patch over one eye, a young lad who looked cross-eyed,
accompanied by a woman who must be his mother, a girl with dark glasses,
two other people without any apparent distinguishing features, but no
one who was blind, blind people do not consult an ophthalmologist. The
woman guided her husband to an empty chair, and since all the other
chairs were occupied, she remained standing beside him, We’ll have to
wait, she whispered in his ear. He realised why, he had heard the voices
of those who were in the waiting-room, now he was assailed by another
worry, thinking that the longer the doctor took to examine him, the
worse his blindness would become to the point of being incurable. He
fidgeted in his chair, restless, he was about to confide his worries to
his wife, but just then the door opened and the receptionist said, Will
you both come this way, and turning to the other patients, Doctor’s
orders, this man is an urgent case. The mother of the cross-eyed boy
protested that her right was her right, and that she was first and had
been waiting for more than an hour. The other patients supported her in
a low voice, but not one of them, nor the woman herself, thought it wise
to carry on complaining, in case the doctor should take offence and
repay their impertinence by making them wait even longer, as has
occurred. The old man with the patch over one eye was magnanimous, Let
the poor man go ahead, he’s in a much worse state than we are. The blind
man did not hear him, they were already going into the doctor’s
consulting room, and the wife was saying, Many thanks for being so kind,
doctor, it’s just that my husband, and that said, she paused, because
frankly she did not know what had really happened, she only knew that
her husband was blind and that their car had been stolen. The doctor
said, Please, be seated, and he himself went to help the patient into
the chair, and then, touching him on the hand, he spoke to him directly,
Now then, tell me what is wrong. The blind man explained that he was in
his car, waiting for the red light to change when suddenly he could no
longer see, that several people had rushed to his assistance, that an
elderly woman, judging from her voice, had said that it was probably a
case of nerves, and then a man had accompanied him home because he could
not manage on his own, I see everything white, doctor. He said nothing
about the stolen car.</p>
<p>The doctor asked him, Has anything like this ever happened to you
before, or something similar, No, doctor, I don’t even use glasses. And
you say it came on all of a sudden, Yes, doctor, Like a light going out,
More like a light going on, During the last few days have you felt any
difference in your eyesight, No, doctor, Is there, or has there ever
been any case of blindness in your family, Among the relatives I’ve
known or have heard discussed, no one, Do you suffer from diabetes, No,
doctor, From syphilis, No, doctor. From hypertension of the arteries or
the brain cells, I’m not sure about the brain cells, but none of these
other things, we have regular medical check-ups at work. Have you taken
a sharp knock on the head, today or yesterday, No, doctor, How old are
you, Thirty-eight, Fine, let’s take a look at these eyes. The blind man
opened them wide, as if to facilitate the examination, but the doctor
took him by the arm and installed him behind a scanner which anyone with
imagination might see as a new version of the confessional, eyes
replacing words, and the confessor looking directly into the sinner’s
soul, Rest your chin here, he advised him, keep your eyes open, and
don’t move. The woman drew close to her husband, put her hand on his
shoulder, and said, This will be sorted out, you’ll see. The doctor
raised and lowered the binocular system at his side, turned finely
adjusted knobs, and began his examination. He could find nothing in the
cornea, nothing in the sclera, nothing in the iris, nothing in the
retina, nothing in the lens of the eye, nothing in the luteous macula,
nothing in the optic nerve, nothing elsewhere. He pushed the apparatus
aside, rubbed his eyes, then carried out a second examination from the
start, without speaking, and when he had finished there was a puzzled
expression on his face, I cannot find any lesion, your eyes are perfect.
The woman joined her hands in a gesture of happiness and exclaimed,
Didn’t I tell you, didn’t I tell you, this can be resolved. Ignoring
her, the blind man asked, May I remove my chin, doctor, Of course,
forgive me, If my eyes are perfect as you say, why am I blind, For the
moment I cannot say, we shall have to carry out more detailed tests,
analyses, an ecography, an encephalogram, Do you think it has anything
to do with the brain, It’s a possibility, but I doubt it. Yet you say
you can find nothing wrong with my eyes, That’s right, How strange, What
I’m trying to say is that if, in fact, you are blind, your blindness at
this moment defies explanation, Do you doubt that I am blind, Not at
all, the problem is the unusual nature of your case, personally, in all
my years in practice, I’ve never come across anything like it, and I
daresay no such case has ever been known in the entire history of
ophthalmology, Do you think there is a cure, In principle, since I
cannot find lesions of any kind or any congenital malformations, my
reply should be in the affirmative, But apparently it is not in the
affirmative, Only out of caution, only because I do not want to build up
hopes that may turn out to be unjustified, I understand, That’s the
situation, And is there any treatment I should follow, some remedy or
other, For the moment I prefer not to prescribe anything, for it would
be like prescribing in the dark. There’s an apt expression, observed the
blind man. The doctor pretended not to hear, got off the revolving stool
on which he had been seated to carry out the examination, and, standing
up, he wrote out on his prescription pad the tests and analyses he
judged to be necessary. He handed the sheet of paper to the wife, Take
this and come back with your husband once you have the results,
meanwhile if there should be any change in his condition, telephone me,
How much do we owe you, doctor, Pay in reception. He accompanied them to
the door, murmured words of reassurance, Let’s wait and see, let’s wait
and see, you mustn’t despair, and once they had gone he went into the
small bathroom adjoining the consulting room and stared at length into
the mirror, What can this be, he murmured. Then he returned to the
consulting room, called out to the receptionist, Send in the next
patient. That night the blind man dreamt that he was blind.</p>
