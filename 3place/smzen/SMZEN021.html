<p>1</p>
<p>WHEN THE LORD, also known as god, realized that adam and eve,
although perfect in every outward aspect, could not utter a word or make
even the most primitive of sounds, he must have felt annoyed with
himself, for there was no one else in the garden of eden whom he could
blame for this grave oversight, after all, the other animals, who were,
like the two humans, the product of his divine command, already had a
voice of their own, be it a bellow, a roar, a croak, a chirp, a whistle
or a cackle. In an excess of rage, surprising in someone who could have
solved any problem simply by issuing another quick fiat, he rushed over
to adam and eve and unceremoniously, no half-measures, stuck his tongue
down the throats of first one and then the other. From the texts which,
over the centuries, have provided a somewhat random record of those
remote times, be it of events that might, at some future date, be
awarded canonical status and others deemed to be the fruit of apocryphal
and irredeemably heretical imaginations, it is not at all clear what
kind of tongue was being referred to here, whether the moist, flexible
muscle that moves around in the buccal cavity and occasionally outside
it too, or the gift of speech, also known as language, that the lord had
so regrettably forgotten to give them and about which we know nothing,
since not a trace of it remains, not even a heart engraved on the bark
of a tree, accompanied by some sentimental message, something along the
lines of I love eve. It’s likely that the lord’s violent assault on his
offspring’s silent tongues had another motive, namely, given that, in
principle, you can’t have one without the other, that of putting them in
contact with the deepest depths of their physical being, the so-called
perturbations of the inner self, so that, in future, they could, with
some authority, speak of those dark and labyrinthine disquiets out of
whose window, the mouth, their tongues were already peering. Well,
anything is possible. With the praiseworthy scrupulousness of any
skilled craftsman, making up with due humility for his earlier
negligence, the lord wanted to make sure that his mistake had been
corrected, and so he asked adam, What’s your name, and the man replied,
I’m adam, your first-born. Then the creator turned to the woman, And
what is your name, I’m Eve, the first lady, she replied rather
unnecessarily, since there was no other. The lord was satisfied and bade
farewell with a fatherly See you later, then, and went about his
business. And, for the first time, adam said to eve, Let’s go to
bed.</p>
<p>Seth, their third child, will only come into the world one hundred
and thirty years later, not because his mother’s womb required that
amount of time to complete the making of a new descendant, but because
the gonads of father and mother, the testes and ovaries respectively,
had taken more than a century to mature and to develop sufficient
generative power. It must be pointed out to our more impatient readers,
first, that the fiat was given once and once only, second, that men and
women are not sausage machines, and, third, that hormones are very
complicated things, they can’t just be produced from one day to the
next, nor can they be found in pharmacies or supermarkets, you have to
let matters take their course. Before seth came into the world, cain had
already arrived, followed, shortly afterwards, by abel. By the way, one
must not underestimate the intense boredom of all those years spent
without neighbors, without distractions, without some small child
crawling about between kitchen and living room, with no other visitors
but the lord, and even his visits were few and very brief, interspersed
by long intervals of absence, ten, fifteen, twenty, fifty years, so we
can easily imagine that the sole occupants of that earthly paradise must
have felt like poor orphans abandoned in the forest of the universe, not
that they would have been able to explain what the words orphan and
abandoned meant. It’s true that every now and then, although again not
with any great frequency, adam would say to eve, Let’s go to bed, but
their conjugal routine, aggravated, in their case, due to inexperience,
by the complete lack of alternative positions to adopt, proved to be as
destructive as an invasion of woodworm to a roof beam. You hardly notice
anything from the outside, just a little dust here and there falling
from tiny holes, but, inside, it’s quite a different matter, and the
collapse of something that had seemed so sturdy will not be long in
coming. In such situations, there are those who say that a child can
have an enlivening effect, if not on the libido, which is the work of
chemicals far more complex than merely learning how to change a diaper,
then at least on feelings, which, you must admit, is no small gain. As
for the lord and his sporadic visits, the first was to see if adam and
eve had had any problems setting up house, the second to find out what
benefits they had gleaned from their experience of country life and the
third to warn them that he would not be back for a while, because he had
to do the rounds of the other paradises that exist in the heavens.
Indeed, he would not appear again until much later, on a date that has
not been recorded, in order to expel the unhappy couple from the garden
of eden for the heinous crime of having eaten of the fruit of the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil. This episode, which gave rise to the
first definition of a hitherto unknown concept, original sin, has never
been satisfactorily explained. Firstly, even the most rudimentary of
intelligences would have no difficulty in grasping that being properly
informed about something is always preferable to being ignorant,
especially in such delicate matters as good and evil, which could put
anyone at risk, quite unwittingly, of being consigned to eternal
damnation in a hell that had not yet been invented. Secondly, the lord
showed a lamentable lack of foresight, because if he really didn’t want
them to eat that fruit, it would have been easy enough simply not to
have planted the tree or to have put it somewhere else or surrounded it
with barbed wire. Thirdly, it wasn’t because they had disobeyed god’s
instructions that adam and eve discovered they were naked. They were
already stark naked when they went to bed, and if the lord had never
noticed such an evident lack of modesty, the fault must lie with a
father’s blindness, an apparently incurable infliction that prevents us
from seeing that our children are, after all, neither better nor worse
than all the others.</p>
<p>A point of order. Before we continue with this instructive and
definitive history of cain, undertaken with unprecedented boldness, it
might be advisable to introduce some clarity into the chronology of
events. So, let us begin by clearing up certain malicious doubts about
adam’s ability to make a child when he was one hundred and thirty years
old. At first sight, if we stick to the fertility indices of modern
times, no, he clearly wouldn’t, but during the world’s infancy, those
same one hundred and thirty years would have represented a vigorous
adolescence that not even the most precocious of casanovas would have
sneered at. It is, moreover, worth remembering that adam lived until he
was nine hundred and thirty years old, thus narrowly missing being
drowned in the great flood, for he died when lamech was still alive,
lamech being the father of noah, the future builder of the ark. He
would, therefore, have had the time and leisure to make all the children
he did make and many more if he had so wished. As we said earlier,
adam’s second child, born after cain, was abel, a handsome, fair-haired
boy, who, having been the object of the best proofs of the lord’s
esteem, met a very sticky end indeed. The third child, as we also said,
was called seth, but he will not form part of this narrative, which we
are writing step by step with all the meticulousness of a historian, and
so we’ll leave him here, just a name and nothing more. There are those
who say that the idea of creating a religion was born in his head, but
we have given abundant attention to such ticklish matters in the past,
with reprehensible levity, according to some experts, and in terms that
will doubtless prove deleterious to us when it comes to the final
judgment at which everyone will be condemned, either for doing too much
or too little. We are only interested now in the family of which father
adam is the head, although he proved to be a very bad head, and we
really can’t put it any other way, since all it took was for his wife to
offer him the forbidden fruit of the knowledge of good and evil and our
illogical first patriarch, after a certain amount of persuasion, more
for appearance’s sake than out of any real conviction, duly choked on
it, leaving us men marked forever by that irritating piece of apple that
will neither go up nor down. There are also those who say that the
reason adam didn’t manage to swallow the whole of that fateful fruit was
because the lord suddenly turned up, demanding to know what was going
on. Now before we forget about it completely or before our continuation
of the story renders the fact redundant because it comes too late, we
will tell you about the stealthy, almost clandestine visit the lord made
to the garden of eden one hot summer night. As usual, adam and eve were
sleeping, naked, beside each other, not touching, a deceptively edifying
image of the most perfect innocence. They did not wake up, and the lord
did not wake them either. He had gone there with the intention of
correcting a slight flaw, which, as he had finally realized, seriously
marred his creations, and that flaw, can you believe it, was the lack of
a navel. The pale skin of his babies, untouched by the gentle sun of
paradise, was too naked, too vulnerable, and in a way obscene, if that
word existed then. Quickly, in case they should wake up, god reached out
and very lightly pressed adam’s belly with the tip of his forefinger,
making a rapid circling movement, and there was a navel. The same
procedure, carried out on eve, produced similar results, with the one
important difference that her navel was much better as regards design,
shape and the delicacy of its folds. This was the last time that the
lord looked upon his work and saw that it was good.</p>
<p>Fifty years and one day after this fortunate surgical intervention,
which gave rise to a new era in the aesthetics of the human body under
the consensual motto that everything about it can always be improved,
disaster struck. With a crack of thunder, the lord appeared. He was
dressed differently from usual, in keeping perhaps with what would
become the new imperial fashion in heaven, wearing a triple crown on his
head and wielding a scepter as if it were a cudgel. I am the lord, he
cried, I am he. A mortal silence fell over the garden of eden, not a
sound, not even the buzz of a wasp, the barking of a dog, the trilling
of a bird, or the trumpeting of an elephant. Nothing, only the
chattering of a flock of starlings that had congregated in a leafy olive
tree, there since the garden was first created, and which suddenly took
flight as one, so many, hundreds, if not thousands of them, that they
nearly obscured the sky. Who has disobeyed my orders, who has eaten of
the fruit of my tree, asked god, fixing adam with a look that can only
be described as coruscating, a word which, though highly expressive, has
sadly fallen out of use. In desperation, the poor man tried in vain to
swallow the telltale piece of apple, but his voice refused to come out,
neither fore nor aft. Answer, said the angry voice of the lord, who was
brandishing his scepter in a most threatening manner. Plucking up his
courage, and conscious of how wrong it was to put the blame on someone
else, adam said, The woman you gave to be with me, she gave me the fruit
of that tree and I did eat. The lord turned on the woman and asked, What
is this that you have done, The serpent beguiled me and I did eat, Liar,
deceiver, there are no serpents in paradise, Lord, I did not say that
there were serpents in paradise, but I did have a dream in which a
serpent appeared to me, saying, So god has forbidden you to eat the
fruit of every tree in the garden, and I said no, that wasn’t true, that
the only tree whose fruit we could not eat was the one that grows in the
middle of paradise, for we would die if we touched it, Serpents can’t
speak, at most they hiss, said the lord, The serpent in my dream spoke,
And may one know what else the serpent said, asked the lord, trying to
give the words a mocking tone that ill accorded with the celestial
dignity of his robes, The serpent said that we wouldn’t die, Oh, I see,
the lord’s irony was becoming more and more marked, it would seem that
this serpent thinks he knows more than I do, That is what I dreamed, my
lord, that you didn’t want us to eat of that fruit because we would open
our eyes and know good and evil just as you know them, lord, And what
did you do, you fallen, frivolous woman, when you woke from this
delightful dream, I went straight to the tree, ate the fruit and brought
some back for adam, who also ate, It got stuck just here, said adam,
touching his throat, Right, said the lord, if that’s the way you want
it, that’s the way it shall be, from now on you can bid farewell to the
good life, you, eve, will not only suffer all the discomforts of
pregnancy, morning sickness included, you will give birth in pain, and
yet you will still feel desire for your husband, and he shall rule over
you, Poor me, said eve, what a bad beginning, and what a sad fate will
be mine, You should have thought of that before, and as for you, adam,
the ground is cursed because of you, and in sorrow will you eat of it
all of your days, it will bring forth only thorns and thistles, and you
will have to eat the herbs of the fields, only by the sweat of your brow
will you manage to grow enough to eat, until you return to the ground
out of which you came, wretched adam, for dust you are and to dust you
will return. That said, the lord plucked out of the air a couple of
animal skins to cover the nakedness of adam and eve, who exchanged
knowing winks, for they had known they were naked from the very first
day and had made the most of it too. Then the lord said, In knowing good
and evil, man has become like a god, and if you were to eat of the fruit
of the tree of life you would gain eternal life, whatever next, two gods
in one universe, that is why I am expelling you and your wife from the
garden of eden, at whose gate I will place an angel armed with a flaming
sword, who will let no one enter, now go, leave, I never want to see you
again. Bearing on their backs the stinking animal hides, staggering
along on unsteady legs, adam and eve resembled two orangutans who had
stood upright for the first time. Outside of the garden of eden, the
earth was arid and inhospitable, the lord was not exaggerating when he
threatened adam with thorns and thistles. As he had so rightly said, the
good life was over.</p>
