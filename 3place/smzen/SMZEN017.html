<h4 id="section">16</h4>
<p>Two days later the doctor said, I’d like to know what has happened to
the surgery, at this stage we are no use for anything, neither it nor I,
but perhaps one day people will recover their sight, the instruments
must still be there waiting, We can go whenever you want, said his wife,
Right now, And we could take advantage of this walk to pass by my home,
if you don’t mind, said the girl with the dark glasses, Not that I
believe that my parents have returned, it’s only to ease my conscience,
We can go to your house too, said the doctor’s wife. Nobody else wanted
to join this reconnoitre of homes, not the first blind man and his wife,
for they already knew what they could count on, the old man with the
black eyepatch also knew, but not for the same reasons, and the boy with
the squint because he still could not remember the name of the street
where he had lived. The weather was bright, it seemed that the rain had
stopped and the sun, though pale, could already be felt on their skin, I
don’t know how we can continue to live if the heat gets any worse, said
the doctor, all this rubbish rotting all over the place, the dead
animals, perhaps even people, there must be dead people inside the
houses, the worst thing is that we are not organised, there should be an
organisation in each building, in each street, in each district, A
government, said the wife, An organisation, the human body is also an
organised system, it lives as long as it keeps organised, and death is
only the effect of a disorganisation, And how can a society of blind
people organise itself in order to survive, By organising itself, to
organise oneself is, in a way, to begin to have eyes, Perhaps you’re
right, but the experience of this blindness has brought us only death
and misery, my eyes, just like your surgery, were useless, Thanks to
your eyes we are still alive, said the girl with the dark glasses, We
would also be alive if I were blind as well, the world is full of blind
people, I think we are all going to die, it’s just a matter of time,
Dying has always been a matter of time, said the doctor, But to die just
because you’re blind, there can be no worse way of dying, We die of
illnesses, accidents, chance events, And now we shall also die of
blindness, I mean, we shall die of blindness and cancer, of blindness
and tuberculosis, of blindness and AIDS, of blindness and heart attacks,
illnesses may differ from one person to another but what is really
killing us now is blindness, We are not immortal, we cannot escape
death, but at least we should not be blind, said the doctor’s wife, How,
if this blindness is concrete and real, said the doctor, I am not sure,
said the wife, Nor I, said the girl with the dark glasses.</p>
<p>They did not have to force the door, it opened normally, the key was
on the doctor’s key ring which had remained in the house when they had
been taken off for quarantine. This is the waiting-room, said the
doctor’s wife, The room I was in, said the girl with the dark glasses,
the dream continues, but I don’t know what dream it is, whether it is
the dream of dreaming which I experienced that day when I dreamt that I
was going blind, or the dream of always having been blind and coming,
still dreaming, to the surgery in order to be cured of an inflammation
of the eyes in which there was no danger of becoming blind, The
quarantine was no dream, said the doctor’s wife, Certainly not, nor was
it a dream that we were raped, Nor that I stabbed a man, Take me to my
office, I can get there on my own but you take me, said the doctor. The
door was open. The doctor’s wife said, The place has been turned upside
down, papers on the floor, the drawers of the file cabinet have been
taken, It must have been the people from the Ministry, not to waste time
looking, Probably, And the instruments, At first sight, they seem to be
in good order, That, at least, is something, said the doctor, he
advanced alone with his arms outstretched, he touched the box with the
lenses, his ophthalmoscope, the desk, then, addressing the girl with the
dark glasses, he said, I know what you are trying to say, when you say
that you are living a dream. He sat down at the desk, placed his hands
on the dusty top, then with a sad, ironic smile, as if he were talking
to someone sitting opposite him, he said, No, my dear doctor, I am very
sorry, but your condition has no known cure, if you want me to give you
one last piece of advice, cling to the old saying, they were right when
they said that patience is good for the eyes. Don’t make us suffer, said
the woman, Forgive me, both of you, we are in the place where miracles
used to be performed, now I don’t even have the evidence of my magic
powers, they have taken it all away, The only miracle we can perform is
to go on living, said the woman, to preserve the fragility of life from
day to day, as if it were blind and did not know where to go, and
perhaps it is like that, perhaps it really does not know, it placed
itself in our hands, after giving us intelligence, and this is what we
have made of it, You speak as if you too were blind, said the girl with
the dark glasses, In a way I am, I am blind with your blindness, perhaps
I might be able to see better if there were more of us who could see, I
am afraid you are like the witness in search of a court to which he has
been summoned by who knows who, in order to make a statement about who
knows what, said the doctor, Time is coming to an end, putrescence is
spreading, diseases find the doors open, water is running out, food has
become poison, that would be my first statement, said the doctor’s wife,
And the second, asked the girl with dark glasses, Let’s open our eyes,
We can’t, we are blind, said the doctor, It is a great truth that says
that the worst blind person was the one who did not want to see, But I
do want to see, said the girl with dark glasses, That won’t be the
reason you will see, the only difference would be that you would no
longer be the worst blind person, and now, let’s go, there is nothing
more to be seen here, the doctor said.</p>
<p>On their way to the home of the girl with dark glasses, they crossed
a large square with groups of blind people who were listening to
speeches from other blind people, at first sight, neither one nor the
other group seemed blind, the speakers turned their heads excitedly
towards their listeners, the listeners turned their heads attentively to
the speakers. They were proclaiming the end of the world, redemption
through penitence, the visions of the seventh day, the advent of the
angel, cosmic collisions, the death of the sun, the tribal spirit, the
sap of the mandrake, tiger ointment, the virtue of the sign, the
discipline of the wind, the perfume of the moon, the revindication of
darkness, the power of exorcism, the sign of the heel, the crucifixion
of the rose, the purity of the lymph, the blood of the black cat, the
sleep of the shadow, the rising of the seas, the logic of anthropophagy,
painless castration, divine tattoos, voluntary blindness, convex
thoughts, or concave, or horizontal or vertical, or sloping, or
concentrated, or dispersed, or fleeting, the weakening of the vocal
cords, the death of the word, Here nobody is speaking of organisation,
said the doctor’s wife, Perhaps organisation is in another square, he
replied. They continued on their way. A bit further on, the doctor’s
wife said, There are more dead in the road than usual, Our resistance is
reaching its end, time is running out, the water is running out, disease
is on the increase, food is becoming poison, you said so before, the
doctor reminded her, Who knows whether my parents are not among these
dead, said the girl with dark glasses, and here, I am passing by without
seeing them, It’s a time-honoured custom to pass by the dead without
seeing them, said the doctor’s wife.</p>
<p>The street where the girl with dark glasses lived, seemed even more
deserted than usual. At the door to the building there was the body of a
woman. Dead, half devoured by stray animals, luckily the dog of tears
had not wanted to come today, it would have been necessary to keep him
from digging his teeth into this corpse. It is the neighbour from the
first floor, said the doctor’s wife, Who, where, asked her husband,
Right here, the first-floor neighbour, you can smell her, Poor woman,
said the girl with dark glasses, why did she have to go out into the
street, she never went out, Perhaps she felt that her death was near,
perhaps she could not stand the idea of staying alone in the flat to
rot, said the doctor. And now we can’t go in, I don’t have the keys,
Perhaps your parents have returned and are inside waiting for you, said
the doctor, I don’t believe it, You are right not to believe it, said
the doctor’s wife, here are the keys. In the palm of the dead woman’s
half-open hand resting on the ground there was a set of keys, shining,
sparkling. Perhaps they are hers, said the girl with dark glasses, I
don’t think so, she had no reason to bring her keys to where she was
thinking of dying, But being blind, I would not be able to see them, if
she thought of bringing them down so that I would be able to get into
the flat, We don’t know what she was thinking of when she decided to
take the keys, perhaps she thought that you would regain your eyesight,
perhaps she suspected that there was something unnatural, too easy,
about the way we moved around when we were here, perhaps she heard me
say that the stair was dark, that I could barely see, or perhaps it was
none of that, delirium, dementia, as if, having lost her mind, she had
got it into her head to give you the keys, the only thing we know is
that her life ended when she set foot outside the door. The doctor’s
wife picked up the keys, handed them to the girl with dark glasses and
then asked, And now, what do we do, are we going to leave her here, We
cannot bury her in the street, we have no tools to lift the stones, said
the doctor, There is the garden in the back, In that case we’ll have to
take her up to the second floor and then down by the emergency stairs,
That’s the only way, Do we have enough strength for this task, asked the
girl with dark glasses, The question is not whether we have enough
strength, the question is whether we can allow ourselves to leave this
woman here, Certainly not, said the doctor, Then the strength must be
found. They did manage, but it was hard work dragging the body upstairs,
not because of what it weighed, little enough, and less still since the
cats and dogs had been at it, but because the body was rigid, stiff,
they had trouble turning the corners of the narrow staircase, during the
short climb they had to rest four times. Neither the noise, nor the
voices, nor the smell of putrefaction brought any other of the
inhabitants of the building on to the landings, Just as I thought, my
parents are not here, said the girl with dark glasses. When they finally
got to the door they were exhausted and they still had to cross to the
back of the building and go down the emergency stairs, but there with
the help of the saints, they get down the stairs, the burden is lighter,
the bends easier to manoeuvre because the stairs were out in the open,
one only had to be careful not to let the poor creature’s body slip from
one’s hands, a tumble would leave it beyond repair, not to mention the
pain which, after death, is worse.</p>
<p>The garden was like an unexplored jungle, the recent rains had caused
the grass and the weeds carried on the wind to grow in abundance, there
would be no lack of fresh food for the rabbits which jumped about, and
chickens manage even in hard times. They were sitting on the ground,
panting, the effort had exhausted them, by their side the corpse rested
like them, guarded by the doctor’s wife who chased off the hens and
rabbits, the rabbits only curious, their noses twitching, the chickens
with their beaks like bayonets, ready for anything. The doctor’s wife
said, Before leaving, she remembered to open the doors of the rabbit
hutches, she did not want the rabbits to die of hunger, The difficult
thing isn’t living with other people, it’s understanding them, said the
doctor. The girl with dark glasses cleaned her dirty hands on a clump of
grass that she had pulled up, it was her own fault, she had grasped the
corpse where she should not have, that’s what happens when you’re blind.
The doctor said, What we need is a spade or a shovel, here one can see
that the true eternal return is that of words, which now return, spoken
for the same reasons, first for the man who stole the car, now for the
old woman who returned the keys, once buried nobody will know the
difference, unless somebody remembers them. The doctor’s wife had gone
up to the flat of the girl with dark glasses in order to find a clean
sheet, she had to choose the least dirty of them, when she came down the
hens were at it, the rabbits were merely chewing the fresh grass. Having
covered and wrapped the body, the wife went in search of a spade or
shovel. She found both in a garden shed along with other tools. I’ll
deal with this, she said, the ground is damp, it is easy to dig, you
take a rest. She chose a spot where there were no roots of the type that
have to be cut with an axe, and don’t imagine that this is an easy job,
roots have their own little ways, they know how to take advantage of the
softness of the soil in order to avoid the blow and weaken the deadly
effect of the guillotine. Neither the doctor’s wife nor her husband nor
the girl with dark glasses, the former because she was digging, the
latter two because their eyes were of no use to them, noticed the
appearance of blind people on the surrounding balconies, not many, not
on all of them, they must have been attracted by the noise of the
digging, even in soft soil there is noise, not forgetting that there is
always some hidden stone that responds loudly to the blow. There were
men and women who appeared as fluid as ghosts, they could have been
ghosts attending a burial out of curiosity, merely to recall how it had
been when they were buried. The doctor’s wife finally saw them when she
had finished digging the grave, she straightened her aching back and
raised her arm to her forehead to wipe away the sweat. Then, carried
away by an irresistible impulse, without thinking, she called out to
those blind people and to all the blind of this world, She will rise
again, note that she did not say She will live again, the matter was not
quite that important, although the dictionary is there to confirm,
reassure or suggest that we are dealing with complete and absolute
synonyms. The blind people took fright and went back inside their flats,
they could not understand why such words had been said, besides they
could not have been prepared for such a revelation, it was clear that
they did not go to the square where the magic utterances were made, in
respect of which all that was needed to complete the picture was the
addition of the head of the praying mantis and the suicide of the
scorpion. The doctor said, Why did you say she will rise again, to whom
were you talking, To a few blind people who appeared on the balconies, I
was startled and I must have frightened them, And why those words rather
than any others, I don’t know, they came into my head and I said them,
The next we know you’ll be preaching in the square we passed along the
way, Yes, a sermon about the rabbit’s tooth and the hen’s beak, come and
help me now, over here, that’s right, take her by the feet, I’ll raise
her from this end, careful, don’t slip into the grave, that’s it, just
so, lower her slowly, more, more, I made the grave a little deeper
because of the hens, once they start scratching, you never know where
they’ll finish up, that’s it. She used the shovel to fill the grave,
stamped the earth firmly down, made the little mound that always remains
of the earth that is returned to the earth, as if she had never done
anything else in her life. Finally, she picked a branch from a rosebush
growing in the corner of the yard and planted it at the head of the
grave. Will she rise again, asked the girl with the dark glasses, Not
her, no, replied the doctor’s wife, those who are still alive have a
greater need to rise again by themselves and they don’t, We are already
half dead, said the doctor, We are still half alive too, answered his
wife. She put the shovel and the spade back in the shed, took a good
look around the yard to check that everything was in order, What order,
she asked herself and provided her own answer, The order that wants the
dead where they should be among the dead, and the living among the
living, while the hens and rabbits feed some and feed off others, I’d
like to leave a small sign for my parents, said the girl with dark
glasses, just to let them know that I am alive, I don’t want to destroy
your hopes, said the doctor, but first they would have to find the house
and that is most unlikely. Just remember that we wouldn’t have got there
without someone to guide us, You’re right, and I don’t even know if they
are still alive, but unless I leave them some sign, anything, I shall
feel as if I had abandoned them. What’s it to be then, asked the
doctor’s wife, Something they might recognise by touch, said the girl
with the dark glasses, the sad thing is that I no longer have anything
on me from the old days. The doctor’s wife looked at her, she was
sitting on the first step of the emergency stairs, with her hands limp
on her knees, her lovely face anguished, her hair spread over her
shoulders, I know what sign you can leave them, she said. She went
rapidly up the stairs, back into the house and returned with a pair of
scissors and a piece of string, What are you thinking of, asked the girl
with dark glasses, worried when she heard the snipping of the scissors
cutting off her hair, If your parents were to return, they would find
hanging from the door handle a lock of hair, who else could it possibly
belong to but their daughter, asked the doctor’s wife, You make me want
to weep, said the girl with the dark glasses, and she had no sooner said
it, than she lowered her head over the folded arms on her knees and gave
in to her sorrows, her sadness, to the emotions aroused by the
suggestion made by the doctor’s wife, then she noticed, without knowing
by what emotional route she had arrived there, that she was also crying
for the old woman on the first floor, the eater of raw meat, the
horrible witch, who with her dead hand had restored to her the keys to
the flat. And then the doctor’s wife said, What times we live in, we
find the order of things inverted, a symbol that nearly always signified
death has become a sign of life, There are hands capable of these and
greater wonders, said the doctor, Necessity is a powerful weapon, my
dear, said the woman, and now that’s enough of philosophy and
witchcraft, let’s hold hands and get on with life. It was the girl with
dark glasses herself who tied the lock of hair to the door handle, Do
you think my parents will notice it, she asked, The door handle is like
the outstretched hand of a house, said the doctor’s wife, and with this
commonplace expression, as one might say, they concluded the visit.</p>
<p>That night once again they had a reading, there was no other way of
distracting themselves, what a pity, the doctor was not, for example, an
amateur violinist, what sweet serenades might otherwise be heard on this
fifth floor, their envious neighbours would say, Either they are doing
very well or else they are completely irresponsible and think they can
escape misery by laughing at the misery of others. Now there is no music
other than that of words, and these, especially those in books, are
discreet, and even if curiosity should bring someone from the building
to listen at the door, they would hear only a solitary murmur, that long
thread of sound that can last into infinity, because the books of this
world, all together, are, as they say the universe is, infinite. When
the reading ended, late that night, the old man with the eyepatch said,
That’s what we have come to, listening to someone reading, I’m not
complaining, I could stay here for ever, said the girl with dark
glasses, I am not complaining either, I only mean that this is all we
are good for, listening to someone reading us the story of a human
mankind that existed before us, let’s be glad of our good fortune at
still having a pair of seeing eyes with us here, the last pair left, if
they are extinguished one day, I don’t even want to think about it, then
the thread which links us to that human mankind would be broken, it will
be as if we were to separate from each other in space, for ever, all
equally blind, As long as I can, the girl with dark glasses said, I’ll
keep on hoping, hoping to find my parents, hoping the boy’s mother will
turn up, You forgot to speak of the hope we all have, What’s that,
Regaining our sight, It’s mad to cling to such hopes, Well, I can tell
you, without such hopes I would already have given up, Give me an
example, Being able to see again, We’ve already had that one, give me
another, I won’t, Why, You wouldn’t be interested, And how do you know
that I wouldn’t, what do you think you know about me that you can by
yourself decide what interests me and what doesn’t, Don’t get angry, I
didn’t mean to hurt you, Men are all the same, they think because they
came out of the belly of a woman they know all there is to know about
women, I know very little about women, and about you I know nothing, as
for men, in my opinion, by modern criteria I am now an old man and
one-eyed as well as being blind, Have you nothing else to say against
yourself, A lot more, you can’t imagine how the list of
self-recriminations grows with advancing age, I am young and have my
fair share already, You haven’t done anything really bad yet, How do you
know, if you’ve never lived with me, You’re right, I have never lived
with you, Why do you repeat my words in that tone of voice, What tone of
voice, That one, All I said was that I have never lived with you, Come
on, come on, don’t pretend that you don’t understand, Don’t insist, I
beg you, I do insist, I want to know, Let’s return to hopes, All right,
The other example of hope which I refused to give was this, What, The
last self-accusation on my list, Please, explain yourself, I never
understand riddles, The monstrous wish of never regaining our sight,
Why, So that we can go on living as we are, Do you mean all together, or
just you and me, Don’t make me answer, If you were only a man you could
avoid answering, like all others, but you yourself said that you are an
old man, and old men, if longevity has any sense at all, should not
avert their face from the truth, answer me, With you, And why do you
want to live with me, Do you want me to tell in front of everybody, We
have done the dirtiest, ugliest, most repulsive things together, what
you can tell me cannot possibly be worse, All right, if you insist, let
it be, because the man I still am loves the woman you are, Was it so
very difficult to make a declaration of love, At my age, people fear
ridicule, You were not ridiculous, Let’s forget it, please, I have no
intention of forgetting it or of letting you forget it either, It’s
nonsense, you forced it out of me and now, And now it’s my turn, Don’t
say anything you may regret later, remember the black list, If I’m
sincere today, what does it matter if I regret it tomorrow, Please stop,
You want to live with me and I want to live with you, You are mad, We’ll
start living together here, like a couple, and we shall continue living
together if we have to separate from our friends, two blind people must
be able to see more than one, It’s madness, you don’t love me, What’s
this about loving, I never loved anyone, I just went to bed with men. So
you agree with me then, Not really, You spoke of sincerity, tell me then
if it’s true that you really love me, I love you enough to want to be
with you, and that is the first time I’ve ever said that to anyone, You
would not have said it to me either if you had met me somewhere before,
an elderly man, half bald with white hair, with a patch over one eye and
a cataract in the other, The woman I was then wouldn’t have said it, I
agree, the person who said it was the woman I am today, Let’s see then
what the woman you will be tomorrow will have to say, Are you testing
me, What an idea, who am I to put you to the test, it’s life that
decides these things, It’s already made one decision.</p>
<p>They had this conversation facing each other, blind eyes staring into
blind eyes, their faces flushed and impassioned and when, because one of
them had said it and because both of them wanted it, they agreed that
life had decided that they should live together, the girl with dark
glasses held out her hands, simply to give them, not in order to know
where she was going, she touched the hands of the old man with the
eyepatch, who gently pulled her towards him, and so they remained
sitting side by side, it was not the first time, obviously, but now the
words of engagement had been spoken. None of the others said anything,
nobody congratulated them, nobody expressed wishes of eternal happiness,
to tell the truth these are not the times for festivities and hopes, and
when the decisions are so serious as these seem to have been, it is not
even surprising that someone might think that one would have to be blind
to behave in this way, silence is the best applause. What the doctor’s
wife did, however, was to put some sofa cushions out in the hallway,
enough to make a comfortable bed, then she led the boy with the squint
there and told him, From today you will sleep here. As to what happened
in the living-room, there is every reason to believe that on that first
night it finally became clear whose was the mysterious hand that washed
the back of the old man with the black eyepatch on that morning when
there was such an abundance of water, all of it purifying.</p>
