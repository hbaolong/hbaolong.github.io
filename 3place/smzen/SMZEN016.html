<h4 id="section">15</h4>
<p>Leaving aside the household dust that takes advantage of a family’s
absence to leave a subtle film on the surface of the furniture, it may
be stated in this connection that these are the only occasions the dust
has to rest, without being disturbed by a duster or vacuum cleaner,
without children running back and forth unleashing an atmospheric
whirlwind as they pass, the flat was clean, any untidiness was only what
might be expected when one leaves in a hurry. Even so, while on that day
they were expecting a summons from the Ministry and the hospital, the
doctor’s wife with the kind of foresight that leads sensible people to
settle their affairs while alive, so that after their death, the
tiresome need for a frantic putting of things in order does not arise,
washed the dishes, made the bed, tidied the bathroom, the result was not
exactly perfect, but truly it would have been cruel to ask any more of
her with those trembling hands and tear-filled eyes. It was nevertheless
a kind of paradise that the seven pilgrims had reached and this
impression was so overwhelming, with no great disrespect for the strict
meaning of the term, we could call it transcendental, that they stopped
in their tracks in the entrance as if paralysed by the unexpected smell
in the flat and it was simply that of a flat in need of a good airing,
at any other time we would have rushed to open all the windows, To air
the place, we would say, today the best thing to do would be to have
them sealed up so that the putrefaction outside would be unable to come
in. The wife of the first blind man said, We’re going to dirty the whole
place, and she was right, if they were to come in with these shoes
covered in mud and excrement, paradise would in a flash become hell, the
latter being the second place, according to the competent authorities
where the putrid, fetid, nauseating, pestilential stench is the worst
thing condemned souls have to bear, not the burning tongs, the cauldrons
of boiling pitch and other artefacts of the foundry and the kitchen.
From time immemorial it has been the custom of housewives to say, Come
in, come in, really, it doesn’t matter, I can clean up any dirt later,
but this one, like her guests, knows where they have come from, she
knows that in the world she lives in what is dirty will get dirtier
still, therefore she asks them if they would be so kind as to remove
their shoes on the landing, it is true that their feet are not clean
either, but there is no comparison, the towels and sheets of the girl
with dark glasses had some effect, they’ve got rid of most of the muck.
So they went in without their shoes, the doctor’s wife searched for and
found a large plastic bag into which she put all the shoes intent upon
giving them a good scrub, she had no idea when or how, then she carried
them out on to the balcony, the air outside would not get any worse on
this account. The sky began to darken, there were heavy clouds, If only
it would rain, she thought. With a clear idea of what had to be done,
she returned to her companions. They were in the sitting-room, silent,
on their feet, for, despite their exhaustion, they had not dared to find
themselves a chair, only the doctor vaguely ran his hands over the
furniture leaving marks on the surface, the first dusting was under way,
some of this dust is already stuck to his fingertips. The doctor’s wife
said, Take your clothes off, we can’t remain in this state, our clothes
are almost as dirty as our shoes, Take off our clothes, asked the first
blind man, here, in front of each other, I don’t think it’s right, If
you wish, I can put each of you in a different part of the flat, the
doctor’s wife replied ironically, then there will be no need to feel
embarrassed, I’ll take off my clothes right here, said the wife of the
first blind man, only you can see me, and even were that not the case, I
haven’t forgotten that you have seen me worse than being naked, it’s my
husband who has the poor memory, I can’t see what possible interest
there can be in recalling disagreeable matters long since forgotten,
muttered the first blind man, If you were a woman and had been where we
have been, you would change your tune, said the girl with dark glasses,
starting to undress the boy with the squint. The doctor and the old man
with the black eyepatch were already naked from the waist up, now they
were removing their trousers, the old man with the black eyepatch said
to the doctor who was at his side, Let me lean on you while I get out of
these trousers. They looked so ridiculous the poor fellows as they
jumped about, it almost made you want to weep. The doctor lost his
balance, dragged the old man with the black eyepatch with him as he
fell, fortunately they both found the situation amusing, and it was
pitiful to watch them, their bodies covered with every kind of filth
imaginable, their private parts all besmeared, white hairs, black hairs,
this was what the respectability of old age and a worthy profession had
come to. The doctor’s wife went to help them get to their feet, shortly
there would be darkness all around and no one will have any cause to
feel embarrassed, Are there any candles in the house, she wondered, the
answer was that she recalled having seen two ancient lamps, an old oil
lamp, with three nozzles, and an old paraffin lamp of the kind with a
glass funnel, for the present, the oil lamp will be good enough, I have
oil, a wick can be improvised, tomorrow I’ll go in search of some
paraffin in one of those stores, it will be much easier to find than a
can of food, Especially if I don’t look for it in the grocer’s, she
thought, surprising herself that she was still capable of joking even in
this situation. The girl with the dark glasses was slowly undressing, in
a way that gave the impression that there would always be something more
no matter how many clothes she removed, one last article of clothing to
cover her nakedness, she cannot explain this sudden modesty, but had the
doctor’s wife been closer, she would have seen the girl blushing, even
though her face was so dirty, let those who can, try to understand
women, one of them suddenly assailed by shame after having gone around
sleeping with men she scarcely knew, the other perfectly capable of
whispering in her ear perfectly calmly, Don’t be embarrassed, he cannot
see you, she would be referring to her own husband, of course, for we
must not forget how the shameless girl tempted him into bed, well, as
everyone knows, with women it is always a case of buyer beware. Perhaps,
in the meantime, the reason is something else, there are two other naked
men here, and one of them has slept with her.</p>
<p>The doctor’s wife gathered up the clothes lying scattered on the
floor, trousers, shirts, a jacket, petticoats and blouses, some soiled
underwear, the latter would take at least a month’s soaking before she
got them clean again, she bundled them up into an armload, Stay here,
she told them, I’m coming straight back, She took the clothes out on to
the balcony, as she had done with the shoes, there she in turn
undressed, looking at the black city under the heavy sky. Not so much as
a pale light in the windows, nor a waning reflection on the house
fronts, what was there was not a city, it was a great mass of pitch
which, on cooling, had hardened in the shape of buildings, rooftops,
chimneys, all dead, all faded. The dog of tears appeared on the balcony,
it was restless, but now there were no tears to lick up, the despair was
all inside her, eyes were dry. The doctor’s wife felt cold, she
remembered the others, standing naked in the middle of the room, waiting
for who knows what. She entered. They had turned into simple, sexless
forms, vague shapes, shadows losing themselves in the half-light, But
this does not affect them, she thought, they fade into the surrounding
light, and it is the light which does not allow them to see. I’m going
to put a light on, she said, At the moment I’m almost as blind as the
rest of you, Has the electricity come back on, asked the boy with the
squint, No, I’m going to light an oil lamp, What’s that, the boy asked
again, I’ll show you later. She rummaged for a box of matches in one of
the plastic bags, went to the kitchen, she knew where she had stored the
oil, she did not need much, she tore a strip from a dish towel in order
to make wicks, then returned to the room where the lamp stood, it was
going to be useful for the first time since it was manufactured, at
first this did not appear to be its destiny, but none of us, lamps, dogs
or humans, knows at the outset, why we have come into this world. One
after the other, over the nozzles of the lamp, three tiny almonds of
light lit up, from time to time they flicker until they give the
impression that the upper part of the flames is lost in mid-air, then
they settle down again as if they were becoming dense, solid, tiny
pebbles of light. The doctor’s wife said, Now that I can see, I’m going
to get clean clothes, But we’re dirty, the girl with the dark glasses
said. Both she and the wife of the first blind man were covering their
breasts and their sex with their hands, This is not for my sake, the
doctor’s wife thought, but because the light of the lamp is looking at
them. Then she said, It is better to have clean clothes on a dirty body,
than to have dirty clothes on a clean body. She took the lamp and went
to search in the drawers of the chest, in the wardrobe, after a few
minutes she returned, she brought pyjamas, dressing-gowns, skirts,
blouses, dresses, trousers, underwear, everything necessary for dressing
seven people decently, it is true that the people were not all the same
size, but in their gauntness they were like so many twins. The doctor’s
wife helped them to dress, the boy with the squint finished up with a
pair of the doctor’s trousers, the kind you wear to the beach or in the
countryside, and which turn us all into children. Now we can sit down,
sighed the wife of the first blind man, Please guide us, we do not know
where to put ourselves.</p>
<p>The room is like all sitting-rooms, it has a low table in the middle,
all around there are sofas that can accommodate everyone, on this one
here sit the doctor and his wife along with the old man with the black
eyepatch, on the other the first blind man and his wife. They are
exhausted. The boy fell asleep at once, with his head on the lap of the
girl with dark glasses, having forgotten all about the lamp. An hour
passed, this was akin to happiness, under the softest of lights their
grimy faces looked washed, the eyes of those who were not asleep shone,
the first blind man reached out for his wife’s hand and pressed it, from
this gesture we can see how a rested body can contribute to the harmony
of the mind. Then the doctor’s wife said, Shortly we’ll have something
to eat, but first we should decide how we are going to live here, don’t
worry, I am not about to repeat the speech that came over the
loudspeaker, there’s enough room to accommodate everyone, we have two
bedrooms that can be used by the couples, the others can sleep in this
room, each on his own sofa, tomorrow I must go in search of some food,
our supplies are running out, it would be helpful if one of you were to
come with me to help me carry the food, but also so that you can start
to learn the way home, to recognise the street corners, one of these
days I might fall ill, or go blind, I am always waiting for it to
happen, in which case I’ll have to learn from you, on another matter,
there will be a bucket on the balcony for our physical needs, I know
that it is not pleasant to go out there, what with all the rain we’ve
had and the cold, but it is, in any case, better than having the house
smelling to high heaven, let us not forget that that was our life during
the time when we were interned, we went down all the steps of indignity,
all of them, until we reached total degradation, the same might happen
here albeit in a different way, there we still had the excuse that the
degradation belonged to someone else, not now, now we are all equal
regarding good and evil, please, don’t ask me what good and what evil
are, we knew what it was each time we had to act when blindness was an
exception, what is right and what is wrong are simply different ways of
understanding our relationships with the others, not that which we have
with ourselves, one should not trust the latter, forgive this moralising
speech, you do not know, you cannot know, what it means to have eyes in
a world in which everyone else is blind, I am not a queen, no, I am
simply the one who was born to see this horror, you can feel it, I both
feel and see it, and that’s enough of this dissertation, Let’s go and
eat. No one asked any questions, the doctor simply said, If I ever
regain my sight, I shall look carefully at the eyes of others, as if I
were looking into their souls, Their souls, asked the old man with the
eyepatch, Or their minds, the name does not matter, it was then that,
surprisingly, if we consider that we are dealing with a person without
much education, the girl with the dark glasses said, Inside us there is
something that has no name, that something is what we are.</p>
<p>The doctor’s wife had already put on the table some of the little
food that was left over, then she helped them to sit down and said, Chew
slowly, that helps to deceive your stomach. The dog of tears did not
come to beg for food, it was used to fasting, moreover it must have
thought that, after the banquet that morning, it had no right to take
even a little food from the mouth of the woman who had wept, the others
appeared not to interest him. In the middle of the table, the lamp with
three flames was waiting for the doctor’s wife to give the promised
explanation, it finally happened after they had eaten, Give me your
hands, she said to the boy with the squint, then guided his fingers
slowly, saying, This is the base, round as you can see, and this the
column that sustains the upper part with the oil container, here, watch
you don’t burn yourself, these are the nozzles, one, two, three, from
these emerge twisted strips of material that suck up the oil from
inside, a match is put to them and they start burning until the oil is
finished, they give off a weak light but it’s good enough to see each
other, I can’t see, One day you will see and on that day I’ll give you
the lamp as a present. What colour is it, Have you ever seen anything
made of brass, I don’t know, I don’t remember, what is brass, Brass is
yellow, Ah. The boy with the squint pondered for a moment, Now he is
going to ask for his mother, thought the doctor’s wife, but she was
wrong, the boy simply said that he wanted water, that he was very
thirsty, You will have to wait till tomorrow, we have no water in the
house, at this very moment she remembered that there was water, some
five litres or more of precious water, the whole contents of the toilet
cistern, it could not be worse than what they had been drinking during
the quarantine. Blind in the darkness, she went to the bathroom, feeling
her way along, she raised the lid of the cistern, she really could not
see if there was water, there was, her fingers told her, she searched
for a glass, plunged it in with great care and filled it, civilisation
had returned to the primitive sources of slime. When she entered the
room everyone remained seated where they were. The lamp lit up their
faces which turned towards her, it was as if she had said, I am back, as
you can see, take advantage, remember this light won’t last for ever.
The doctor’s wife brought the glass to the boy with the squint’s lips
and said, Here is your water, drink slowly, slowly, and savour it, a
glass of water is a marvellous thing, she was not talking to him, she
was not talking to anyone, simply communicating to the world what a
marvellous thing a glass of water is. Where did you get it, is it rain
water, asked the husband, No, it’s from the cistern. Didn’t we have a
large bottle of water when we left this place, he asked again, the wife
said, Of course, why didn’t I think of it, a half-full bottle and
another that had not even been started, what luck, don’t drink, don’t
drink anymore, she said to the boy, we are all going to drink fresh
water, I’ll put our best glasses on the table and we are going to drink
fresh water. This time she took the lamp and went to the kitchen, she
returned with the bottle, the light shone through it, it made the
treasure inside sparkle. She put it on the table, went to fetch the
glasses, the best they had, of finest crystal, then, slowly, as if she
were performing a rite, she filled them. At last, she said, Let’s drink.
The blind hands groped and found the glasses, they raised them
trembling. Let’s drink, the doctor’s wife said again. In the middle of
the table, the lamp was like a sun surrounded by shining stars. When
they had put the glasses back on the table, the girl with the dark
glasses and the old man with the eyepatch were crying.</p>
<p>It was a restless night. Vague in the beginning, and imprecise, the
dreams went from sleeper to sleeper, they lingered here, they lingered
there, they brought with them new memories, new secrets, new desires,
that is why the sleepers sighed and murmured, This dream is not mine,
they said, but the dream replied, You do not yet know your dreams, in
this way the girl with the dark glasses came to find out who the old man
with the black eyepatch was, lying there asleep two paces away, in this
way he thought he knew who she was, he merely thought he did, it is not
enough for dreams to be reciprocal in order to be the same. As dawn
broke it began to rain. The wind beating fiercely against the windows
sounded like the cracking of a thousand whiplashes. The doctor’s wife
woke up, opened her eyes and murmured, Listen to that rain, then she
closed them again, in the room it was still black night, now she could
sleep. She barely managed a minute, she woke abruptly with the idea that
she had something to do, but without yet understanding what it might be,
the rain was saying to her, Get up, what did the rain want, Slowly, so
as not to disturb her husband, she left the bedroom, crossed the
sitting-room, paused for an instant to make sure they were all sleeping
on the sofas, then she proceeded along the corridor as far as the
kitchen, it was over this part of the building that the rain fell with
the greatest force, driven by the wind. With the sleeve of her
dressing-gown she cleaned the steamed-up glass panel of the door and
looked outside. The entire sky was one great cloud, the rain poured down
in torrents. Piled up on the balcony-floor were the dirty clothes they
had taken off, there was the plastic bag with the shoes waiting to be
washed. Wash. The last veil of sleep was suddenly torn, this was what
she had to do. She opened the door, took one step, immediately the rain
drenched her from head to foot, as if she were beneath a waterfall. I
must take advantage of this water, she thought. She went back into the
kitchen and, making as little noise as possible, began gathering
together bowls, pots and pans, anything in which she could collect some
of the rain that was falling from heaven in sheets, harried about by the
wind, sweeping over the roofs of the city like a large and noisy broom.
She took them outside, arranged them along the balcony up against the
railing, now there would be water to wash the dirty clothes and filthy
shoes, Don’t let it stop, she murmured as she searched in the kitchen
for soap and detergents, scrubbing brushes, anything that might be used
to clean a little, at least a little, of this unbearable filth of the
soul. Of the body, she said, as if to correct this metaphysical thought,
then she added, It’s all the same. Then, as if this had to be the
inevitable conclusion, the harmonious conciliation between what she had
said and what she thought, she quickly took off her drenched
dressing-gown, and, now, receiving on her body, sometimes a caress,
sometimes the whiplash of the rain, she began to wash the clothes and
herself at the same time. The sound of water that surrounded her
prevented her from noticing right away that she was no longer alone. At
the door to the balcony stood the girl with dark glasses and the wife of
the first blind man, we cannot tell what presentiments, what intuition,
what inner voices might have roused them, nor do we know how they found
their way here, there is no point searching for explanations for the
moment, conjectures are free. Help me, said the doctor’s wife when she
saw them, How, since we cannot see, asked the wife of the first blind
man. Take off your clothes, the less we have to dry afterwards, the
better, But we can’t see, the wife of the first blind man repeated, It
does not matter, said the girl with the dark glasses, We shall do what
we can, And I shall finish off later, said the doctor’s wife, I shall
clean whatever is still dirty, and now to work, let’s go, we are the
only woman in the world with two eyes and six hands. Perhaps in the
building opposite, behind those closed windows some blind people, men,
women, roused by the noise of the constant beating of the rain, with
their head pressed against the cold window-panes covering with their
breath on the glass the dullness of the night, remember the time when,
like now, they last saw rain falling from the sky. They cannot imagine
that there are moreover three naked women out there, as naked as when
they came into the world, they seem to be mad, they must be mad, people
in their right mind do not start washing on a balcony exposed to the
view of the neighbourhood, even less looking like that, what does it
matter that we are all blind, these are things one must not do, my God,
how the rain is pouring down on them, how it trickles between their
breasts, how it lingers and disappears into the darkness of the pubis,
how it finally drenches and flows over the thighs, perhaps we have
judged them wrongly, or perhaps we are unable to see this the most
beautiful and glorious thing that has happened in the history of the
city, a sheet of foam flows from the floor of the balcony, if only I
could go with it, falling interminably, clean, purified, naked. Only God
sees us, said the wife of the first blind man, who, despite
disappointments and setbacks, clings to the belief that God is not
blind, to which the doctor’s wife replies, Not even he, the sky is
clouded over, Only I can see you, Am I ugly, asked the girl with the
dark glasses, You are skinny and dirty, you will never be ugly, And I,
asked the wife of the first blind man, You are dirty and skinny like
her, not as pretty, but more than I, You are beautiful, said the girl
with the dark glasses, How do you know, since you have never seen me, I
have dreamt of you twice, When, The second time was last night, You were
dreaming about the house because you felt safe and calm, it’s only
natural after all we’ve been through, in your dream I was the home, and
in order to see me you needed a face, so you invented it, I too see you
as beautiful, and I never dreamt of you, said the wife of the first
blind man, Which only goes to show that blindness is the good fortune of
the ugly, You are not ugly, No, as a matter of fact I am not, but at my
age, How old are you, asked the girl with the dark glasses, Getting on
for fifty, Like my mother, And her, Her, what, Is she still beautiful,
She was more beautiful once, that’s what happens to all of us, we were
all more beautiful once, You were never more beautiful, said the wife of
the first blind man. Words are like that, they deceive, they pile up, it
seems they do not know where to go, and, suddenly, because of two or
three or four that suddenly come out, simple in themselves, a personal
pronoun, an adverb, a verb, an adjective, we have the excitement of
seeing them coming irresistibly to the surface through the skin and the
eyes and upsetting the composure of our feelings, sometimes the nerves
that cannot bear it any longer, they put up with a great deal, they put
up with everything, it was as if they were wearing armour, we might say.
The doctor’s wife has nerves of steel, and yet the doctor’s wife is
reduced to tears because of a personal pronoun, an adverb, a verb, an
adjective, mere grammatical categories, mere labels, just like the two
women, the others, indefinite pronouns, they too are crying, they
embrace the woman of the whole sentence, three graces beneath the
falling rain. These are moments that cannot last for ever, these women
have been here for more than an hour, it is time they felt cold, I’m
cold, said the girl with the dark glasses. We cannot do anything more
with the clothes, the shoes are spick and span, now it is time for these
women to wash themselves, they soak their hair and wash each other’s
backs and they laugh as only little girls laugh when they play blind
man’s buff in the garden before becoming blind. Day broke, the first
rays of sun peered over the shoulder of the world before hiding once
more behind the clouds. It continues to rain but with less force. The
washerwomen went back to the kitchen, they dried themselves and rubbed
themselves with the towels the doctor’s wife had gone to fetch from the
bathroom cupboard, their skins smell strongly of detergent, but such is
life, if you haven’t got a dog to hunt with use a cat, the soap
disappeared in a twinkling of the eye, even though this house seems to
have everything or is it just that they know how to make the best use of
what they have got, at last, they covered themselves, paradise was out
there, the dressing-gown of the doctor’s wife is soaking wet, but she
put on a flowered dress that she had not worn for years and which made
her the prettiest of the three.</p>
<p>When they entered the sitting-room, the doctor’s wife saw that the
old man with the black eyepatch was sitting up on the sofa where he had
slept. He held his head between his hands, his fingers plunged into the
thatch of white hair which still grew from his forehead to the back of
his neck, and he was calm, tense, as if he wanted to hold on to his
thoughts, or, on the contrary, to stop them altogether. He heard them
come in, he knew where they came from, and what they had been doing,
that they had been naked, and if he knew all this it was not because he
had suddenly regained his sight and, like the other old men, crept up to
spy on not one Susanna in her bath, but on three, he was blind, he
stayed blind, he had only got to the kitchen door from where he heard
what they were saying on the balcony, the laughter, the noise of the
rain and the beating of the water, he breathed in the smell of the soap,
then he returned to the sofa, thinking that there was still life in this
world, to ask whether there was still any part of it left for him. The
doctor’s wife said, The women have already washed, Now it is the men’s
turn, and the old man with the black eyepatch asked, Is it still
raining, Yes, it is raining and there is water in the basins on the
balcony, Then I prefer to wash in the bathroom, in the tub, he
pronounced the word as if he were showing his birth certificate, as if
he were explaining, I am of the generation in which people did not speak
of baths but of tubs, and added, If you don’t mind, of course, I do not
want to dirty the house, I promise that I shall not spill any water on
the floor, at least, I shall do my best, In that case I shall bring you
some water into the bathroom, I’ll help, I can manage on my own, I have
to be of some use, I am not an invalid, Come, then. On the balcony, the
doctor’s wife pulled an almost full basin of water inside. Take a hold
here, she said to the old man with the black eyepatch, guiding his
hands, Now, they lifted the basin at one go. Just as well that you came
to help me, I could not have managed alone, Do you know the saying, What
saying, Old people cannot do much but their work is not to be despised,
That’s not the way it goes, All right, instead of old people, it should
be children, and instead of despise, it should be disdain, but if
sayings are to retain any meaning and to continue to be used they have
to adapt to the times. You are a philosopher, What an idea, I am just an
old man. They emptied the basin into the bath, then the doctor’s wife
opened a drawer, she remembered that she still had one new bar of soap.
She put it into the hand of the old man with the black eyepatch, You are
going to smell nice, better than us, use it all, do not worry, there may
not be any food, but there is bound to be soap in these supermarkets,
Thank you, Watch you don’t slip, if you want I’ll call my husband to
help you, Thanks, I prefer to wash by myself, As you like, and here,
wait, give me your hand, there’s a razor and a brush, if you want to
shave off that beard, Thanks. The doctor’s wife left. The old man with
the eyepatch took off the pyjamas which had been allotted to him in the
distribution of clothes, then, carefully, he got into the bath. The
water was cold and there was little of it, less than a foot, how
different is this sad puddle from receiving it in buckets from heaven as
the three women had. He knelt on the bottom of the bath, took a deep
breath, with both hands together he suddenly splashed water against his
chest which almost took his breath away. He rapidly splashed water all
over himself so as not to have time to shiver, then, step by step,
systematically, he started to soap himself, to rub heavily starting from
the shoulders, arms, chest and stomach, his groin, his penis, between
his legs, I am worse than an animal, he thought, then the thin thighs
down to the layer of grime that covered his feet. He made lather so that
the cleaning process should be extended, he said, I have to wash my hair
and moved his hands back to untie the eye-patch, You too need a bath, he
loosened it and dropped it into the water, now he felt warm, he wet and
soaped his hair, he was a man of foam, white in the middle of an immense
white blindness where nobody could find him, if that was what he
thought, he was deceiving himself, at that moment he felt hands touching
his back, gathering the foam from his arms, and from his chest and
spreading it over his back, slowly, as if, being unable to see what they
were doing, they had to pay closer attention to the job. He wanted to
ask, Who are you, but he couldn’t speak, now he was shivering, not from
the cold, the hands continued to wash him gently, the woman did not say,
I am the doctor’s wife, I am the wife of the first blind man, I am the
girl with dark glasses, the hands finished their task, withdrew, in the
silence one could hear the gentle noise of the bathroom door closing,
the old man with the eyepatch was alone, kneeling in the bath as if
imploring a favour from heaven, trembling, trembling, Who could it have
been, he asked himself, his reason told him that it could only have been
the doctor’s wife, she is the one who can see, she is the one who has
protected us, cared for us and fed us, it would not be surprising that
she should have given me this discreet attention, it is what his reason
told him, but he did not believe in reason. He continued to shiver, he
did not know whether it was from excitement or from cold. He found the
eyepatch at the bottom of the bath, rubbed it hard, wrung it dry and put
it back, with it he felt less naked. When he entered the sitting-room,
dry, perfumed, the doctor’s wife said, We already have one man who is
clean and shaven, and then, in the tone of voice of someone who has just
remembered something that should have been done and was not, You had no
one to wash your back, what a pity. The old man with the black eye-patch
did not reply, he merely thought that he had been right not to believe
in reason.</p>
<p>They gave what little food there was to the boy with the squint, the
others would have to wait for fresh supplies. In the larder there were
some jars of preserves, some dried fruit, sugar, some left-over
biscuits, some dry toast, but they would use these reserves and others
added to them only in case of extreme necessity, the food from day to
day would have to be earned, just in case by some misfortune the
expedition returned empty-handed, meanwhile two biscuits per person with
a spoonful of jam, There is strawberry and peach, which do you prefer,
three walnut halves, a glass of water, a luxury while it lasts. The wife
of the first blind man said that she too wanted to look for food, three
would not go amiss, even being blind, two of them could help to carry
the food and besides, were it possible, bearing in mind that they were
not that far away, she would like to go and see what state her home was
in, if it had been occupied, if the people were known to her, for
example neighbours from the building whose family had grown because some
relatives from the provinces had arrived with the idea of saving
themselves from the epidemic of blindness that had attacked their
village, the city always enjoys better resources. Therefore the three of
them left, dressed in what dry clothes they could find in the house, the
others, those that have been washed, have to wait for better weather.
The sky remained overcast but there was no threat of rain. Swept along
by the water, especially in the steeper streets, the rubbish had piled
up in small heaps leaving wide stretches of pavement clean. If only the
rain would last, in this situation sunshine would be the worst that
could happen to us, said the doctor’s wife, we’ve got enough filth and
bad smells already, We notice it more because we are washed, said the
wife of the first blind man and her husband agreed, although he
suspected that the cold bath had given him a cold. There were crowds of
blind people in the streets, they took advantage of the break in the
weather to search for food and to satisfy there and then their need to
defecate which they still had despite the little food and drink they
took in. Dogs sniffed everywhere, they scrabbled in the rubbish, the odd
one carried a drowned rat in its mouth, a very rare occurrence that
could only be explained by the extraordinary abundance of the recent
downpours, the flood caught him in the wrong place, being a good swimmer
was of no use to him. The dog of tears did not mix with his former
companions in the pack and the hunt, his choice is made, but he does not
wait to be fed, he is already chewing heaven knows what, these mountains
of rubbish hide unimaginable treasures, it is all a matter of searching,
scratch ing and finding. The blind man and his wife will also have to
search and scratch in their memory when the occasion arises, now they
had memorised the four corners, not of the house where they live, which
has many more, but of their street, the four street corners which will
serve them as cardinal points, the blind are not interested where east
and west lie, or north or south, all they want is that their groping
hands tell them that they are on the right road, formerly, when they
were still few, they used to carry white sticks, the sound of the
continuous taps on the ground and the walls was a sort of code which
allowed them to identify and recognise their route, but today, since
everybody is blind, a white stick, in the middle of the general clamour,
is less than helpful, quite apart from the fact that, immersed in his
own whiteness, the blind man may come to doubt whether he is actually
carrying anything in his hand. Dogs, as everyone knows, have, in
addition to what we call instinct, other means of orientation, it is
certain that because of their shortsightedness they do not rely much on
their sight, however, since their nose is well ahead of their eyes, they
always get to where they want, in this case, just to be sure, the dog of
tears lifted its leg to the four corners of the wind, the breeze will
take on the task of guiding it home if it were to get lost one day. As
they went along the doctor’s wife looked up and down the streets in
search of food shops where she could build up their much reduced larder.
The looting had not been complete because in old-fashioned groceries
there were still some beans or some chick peas in the storerooms, they
are dried pulses which take a long time to cook, one thing is water,
another thing is fuel, therefore they are not much appreciated these
days. The doctor’s wife was not particularly keen on the tendency of
proverbs to preach, nevertheless something of this ancient lore must
have remained in her memory, the proof being that she filled two of the
bags they had brought with beans and chick peas, Keep what is of no use
at the moment, and later you will find what you need, one of her
grandmothers had told her, the water in which you soak them will also
serve to cook them, and whatever remains from the cooking will cease to
be water, but will have become broth. It is not only in nature that from
time to time not everything is lost and something is gained.</p>
<p>Why they were loaded with bags of beans and peas and anything else
they happened to pick up when they were still some distance away from
the street where the first blind man and his wife lived, for that is
where they are going, is a question that could only occur to someone who
has never in his life suffered shortages. Take it home, even if it’s a
stone, that same grandmother had said, but she forgot to add, Even if
you have to go around the earth, this was the feat they were now
embarked upon, they were going home by the longest route. Where are we,
the first blind man asked, he addressed the doctor’s wife, that is what
she had eyes for, and he said, This is where I went blind, on this
corner with the traffic lights, Right here, on this corner, Precisely on
this spot. I do not want to remember what happened, trapped in the car
without being able to see, people shouting outside, and me shouting
desperately that I was blind, until that man turned up and took me home,
Poor man, the wife of the first blind man said, he will never steal a
car again, We are so afraid of the idea of having to die, said the
doctor’s wife, that we always try to find excuses for the dead, as if we
were asking beforehand to be excused when it is our turn, All this still
seems like a dream, the wife of the first blind man said, it is as if I
were dreaming that I am blind, When I was at home, waiting for you, I
also thought so, said her husband. They had left the square where it had
happened, now they climbed some narrow labyrinthine streets, the
doctor’s wife hardly knows these places but the first blind man does not
get lost, he knows the way, she says the names of the streets and he
says, Let’s turn to the left, Let’s turn to the right, finally he says,
This is our street, the building is on the left-hand side, roughly in
the middle, What is the number, asked the doctor’s wife, he can’t
remember, Now then, it’s not that I cannot remember, it’s gone from my
head, he said, that was a bad omen, if we do not even know where we
live, if the dream has replaced our memory, where will that road take
us, All right, this time it is not serious, it was lucky that the first
blind man’s wife had the idea of coming on the excursion, there we
already have her saying the house number, this helped her to avoid
having to have recourse to the first blind man, who was priding himself
on the fact that he can recognise the door by the magic of touch, as if
he were carrying a magic wand, one touch, metal, one touch, wood, with
three or four more he would arrive at the full pattern, I’m sure it is
this one. They entered, the doctor’s wife first, What floor is it, she
asked, The third, answered the first blind man, his memory was not as
bad as had appeared, some things we forget, that’s life, others we
remember, for example, to remember when, already blind, he had entered
this door, On what floor do you live, asked the man who had not yet
stolen the car, Third, he replied, the difference being that this time
they are not going up in the elevator, they walk up the invisible
staircase which is at once dark and luminous, how people who are not
blind miss electric light, or sunlight, or the light of a candle, now
the doctor’s wife has got used to the semi-darkness, halfway up they run
into two blind women from the upper floors coming down, perhaps from the
third, nobody asked, it is true the neighbours are not, in fact, the
same.</p>
<p>The door was closed. What are we going to do, asked the doctor’s
wife, Leave it to me, said the first blind man. They knocked once,
twice, three times. There’s nobody in, one of them said at exactly the
moment when the door opened, the delay was not surprising, a blind
person at the back of the flat cannot come running to answer the door.
Who is it, what do you want, asked the man who opened the door, he had a
serious look on his face, he was polite, he must be someone we can talk
to. The first blind man said, I used to live in this flat, Ah, the other
replied, Is there anybody with you, My wife, and also a friend of ours,
How can I be sure that this was your flat, That’s easy, the wife of the
first blind man said, I can tell you everything there is inside. The
other man paused a few seconds, then he said, Come in. The doctor’s wife
went in last, here nobody needed a guide. The blind man said, I am
alone, my family went to look for food, perhaps I should have said the
women, but I do not think it would be proper, he paused and then added,
Yet you may think that I should know, What do you mean, asked the
doctor’s wife, The women I referred to are my wife and my two daughters,
and I should know when it is proper to use the expression “women.“ I am
a writer, we are supposed to know such things. The first blind man felt
flattered, imagine, a writer living in my flat, then a doubt rose in
him, was it good manners to ask him his name, he might even have heard
of his name, it was even possible that he had read him, he was still
hesitating between curiosity and discretion, when his wife put the
question directly, What is your name, Blind people do not need a name, I
am my voice, nothing else matters, But you wrote books and those books
carry your name, said the doctor’s wife, Now nobody can read them, it is
as if they did not exist. The first blind man felt that the conversation
was moving too far from the topic which he was most interested in, And
how do you come to be in my flat, he asked, Like many others who no
longer live where they used to live, I found my house occupied by people
who did not want to listen to reason, one might say that we were kicked
down the stairs, Is your house far away, No, Did you try to get it back,
asked the doctor’s wife, it is now quite common for people to move from
house to house, I have already tried twice, And are they still there,
Yes. And what are you going to do now that you know that this is our
flat, the first blind man wanted to know, are you going to throw us out
as they did to you, No, I have neither the age nor the strength for
that, and even if I did, I do not believe that I would be capable of
such a speedy procedure, a writer manages to acquire in life the
patience he needs to write. You will leave us the flat, though, Yes, if
we cannot find another solution, I cannot see what other solution could
be found. The doctor’s wife had already guessed what the writer’s reply
would be, You and your wife, like the friend who is with you, live in a
flat, I imagine, Yes, in her flat in fact, Is it far away, Not really,
Then, if you’ll permit me, I have a proposal to make, Go on, That we
carry on as we are, at this moment we both have a place where we can
live, I shall continue to keep a watchful eye on what is happening to
mine, if one day I find it free, I shall move in immediately, you will
do the same, Come here at regular intervals and when you find it empty,
move in, I am not sure I like the idea, I didn’t expect you to like it
but I doubt whether you would prefer the only remaining alternative,
What is that, For you to recover this flat which is yours, But, in that
case, Precisely, in that case we shall have to find somewhere else to
live, No, don’t even think about it, intervened the wife of the first
blind man, Let’s leave things as they are, and see what happens, It
occurred to me that there is another solution, said the writer, And what
might that be, asked the first blind man, We shall live here as your
guests, the flat is big enough for all of us, No, said the wife of the
first blind man, We shall carry on as before, living with our friend,
there is no need to ask if you agree, she added, addressing the doctor’s
wife, And there is no need for me to reply, I am obliged to all of you,
said the writer, all this time I have been waiting for someone to
reclaim the flat, To accept what one has is the most natural thing when
one is blind, said the doctor’s wife, How have you managed since the
outbreak of the epidemic, We came out of internment only three days ago,
Ah, you were in quarantine, Yes, Was it hard, Worse than that, How
horrible, You are a writer, you have, as you said a moment ago, an
obligation to know words, therefore you know that adjectives are of no
use to us, if a person kills another, for example, it would be better to
state this fact openly, directly, and to trust that the horror of the
act, in itself, is so shocking that there is no need for us to say it
was horrible, Do you mean that we have more words than we need, I mean
that we have too few feelings, Or that we have them but have ceased to
use the words they express, And so we lose them, I’d like you to tell me
how you lived during quarantine, Why, I am a writer, You would have to
have been there, A writer is just like anyone else, he cannot know
everything, nor can he experience everything, he must ask and imagine,
One day I may tell you what it was like, then you can write a book, Yes,
I am writing it, How, if you are blind, The blind too can write, You
mean that you had time to learn the braille alphabet, I do not know
braille, How can you write, then, asked the first blind man, Let me show
you. He got up from his chair, left the room and after a minute
returned, he was holding a sheet of paper in his hand and a ball-point
pen, this is the last complete page I have written, We cannot see it,
said the wife of the first blind man, Nor I, said the writer, Then how
can you write, asked the doctor’s wife, looking at the sheet of paper
where in the half-light of the room she could make out tightly
compressed lines, occasionally superimposed, By touch, the writer
answered smiling, it is easy, you place the sheet over a soft surface,
for example some sheets of paper, then it’s just a question of writing,
But if you cannot see anything, said the first blind man, A ball-point
pen is an excellent tool for blind writers, it does not permit them to
read what they have written, but it tells them where they have written,
they only have to follow with their fingers the impression left by the
last written line, then you write as far as the edge of the paper, and
calculating the distance to the next line is very easy, I notice that
some lines overlap, said the doctor’s wife, gently taking the sheet out
of his hand, How do you know, I can see, You can see, have you recovered
your sight, how, when, the writer asked excitedly, I suppose I am the
only person who has never lost it, And why, what is the explanation for
this, I have no explanation, there may not be one, That means that you
saw everything that has happened, I saw what I saw, I had no option, How
many people were in the quarantine, Nearly three hundred, From when,
From the beginning, we only came out three days ago, as I said, I
believe that I was the first person to go blind, said the first blind
man, That must have been horrible, That word again, said the doctor’s
wife, Forgive me, suddenly everything I have been writing about since we
turned blind, my family and I, strikes me as being ridiculous, About
what, About what we suffered, about our life, Everyone has to speak of
what they know, and what they do not know they should ask, That’s why I
ask you, And I will answer, I don’t know when, some day. The doctor’s
wife brushed the writer’s hand with the paper. Would you mind showing me
where you work and what you are writing, Not at all, come with me, Can
we come too, asked the wife of the first blind man, The flat is yours,
said the writer, I am only passing through. In the bedroom there was a
tiny table with an unlit lamp. The dim light entering through the
window, allowed one to see to the left some blank sheets, others on the
right-hand side had been written on, in the middle there was one half
written. There were two new ball-point pens next to the lamp. Here it
is, said the writer. The doctor’s wife asked, May I? without waiting for
a reply she picked up the written pages, there must have been about
twenty, she passed her eye over the tiny handwriting, over the lines
which went up and down, over the words inscribed on the whiteness of the
page, recorded in blindness, I am only passing through, the writer had
said, and these were the signs he had left in passing. The doctor’s wife
placed her hand on his shoulder, and with both hands he reached out for
it and raised it slowly to his lips, Don’t lose yourself, don’t let
yourself be lost, he said, and these were unexpected, enigmatic words
that did not seem to fit the occasion.</p>
<p>When they returned home, carrying enough food for three days, the
doctor’s wife, interrupted by the excited interjections from the first
blind man and his wife, told what had happened. And that night, as was
only right, she read to all of them a few pages from a book she had gone
to fetch from the study. The boy with the squint was not interested in
the story, and after a little while he fell asleep with his head on the
lap of the girl with the dark glasses and his feet resting on the legs
of the old man with the eyepatch.</p>
