<h4 id="section">8</h4>
<p>The arrival of so many blind people appeared to have brought at least
one advantage, or, rather, two advantages, the first of these being of a
psychological nature, as it were, for there is a vast difference between
waiting for new inmates to turn up at any minute, and realising that the
building is completely full at last, that from now on it will be
possible to establish and maintain stable and lasting relations with
one’s neighbours, without the disturbances there have been up until now,
because of the constant interruptions and interventions by the new
arrivals which obliged us to be for ever reconstituting the channels of
communication. The second advantage, of a practical, direct and
substantial nature, was that the authorities outside, both civilian and
military, had understood that it was one thing to provide food for two
or three dozen people, more or less tolerant, more or less prepared,
because of their small number, to resign themselves to occasional
mistakes or delays in the delivery of food, and quite another to be
faced with the sudden and complex responsibility of feeding two hundred
and forty human beings of every type, background and temperament. Two
hundred and forty, take note, and that is just a manner of speaking, for
there are at least twenty blind internees who have not managed to find a
bed and are sleeping on the floor. In any case, it has to be recognised
that thirty persons being fed on rations meant for ten is not the same
as sharing out to two hundred and sixty, food intended for two hundred
and forty. The difference is almost imperceptible. Now then, it was the
conscious assumption of this increased responsibility, and perhaps, a
hypothesis not to be disregarded, the fear that further disturbances
might break out, that determined a change of procedure on the part of
the authorities, in the sense of giving orders that the food should be
delivered on time and in the right quantity. Obviously, after the
struggle, in every respect lamentable, that we had to witness,
accommodating so many blind internees was not going to be easy or free
of conflict, we need only remember those poor contaminated creatures who
before could still see and now see nothing, of the separated couples and
their lost children, of the discomfort of those who had been trampled
and knocked down, some of them twice or three times, of those who are
going around in search of their cherished possessions without finding
them, one would have to be completely insensitive to forget, as if it
were nothing, the misfortunes of these poor people. However, it cannot
be denied that the announcement that lunch was about to be delivered was
like a consoling balm for everyone. And if it is undeniable that, given
the lack of adequate organisation for this operation or of any authority
capable of imposing the necessary discipline, the collection of such
large quantities of food and its distribution to feed so many mouths led
to further misunderstandings, we must concede that the atmosphere
changed considerably for the better, when throughout that ancient asylum
there was nothing to be heard except the noise of two hundred and sixty
mouths masticating. Who is going to clean up this mess afterwards is a
question so far unanswered, only in the late afternoon will the voice on
the loudspeaker repeat the rules of orderly conduct that must be
observed for the good of all, and then it will become clear with what
degree of respect the new arrivals treat these rules. It is no small
thing that the inmates of the second ward in the right wing have
decided, at long last, to bury their dead, at least we shall be rid of
that particular stench, the smell of the living, however fetid, will be
easier to get used to.</p>
<p>As for the first ward, perhaps because it was the oldest and
therefore most established in the process and pursuit of adaptation to
the state of blindness, a quarter of an hour after its inmates had
finished eating, there was not so much as a scrap of dirty paper on the
floor, a forgotten plate or dripping receptacle. Everything had been
gathered up, the smaller objects placed inside the larger ones, the
dirtiest of them placed inside those that were less dirty, as any
rationalised regulation of hygiene would demand, as attentive to the
greatest efficiency possible in gathering up leftovers and litter, as to
the economy of effort needed to carry out this task. The state of mind
which perforce will have to determine social conduct of this nature
cannot be improvised nor does it come about spontaneously. In the case
under scrutiny, the pedagogical approach of the blind woman at the far
end of the ward seems to have had a decisive influence, that woman
married to the ophthalmologist, who has never tired of telling us, If we
cannot live entirely like human beings, at least let us do everything in
our power not to live entirely like animals, words she repeated so often
that the rest of the ward ended up by transforming her advice into a
maxim, a dictum, into a doctrine, a rule of life, words which deep down
were so simple and elementary, probably it was just that state of mind,
propitious to any understanding of needs and circumstances, that
contributed, even if only in a minor way to the warm welcome the old man
with the black eyepatch found there when he peered through the door and
asked those inside, Any chance of a bed here. By a happy coincidence,
clearly indicative of future consequences, there was a bed, the only
one, and it is anyone’s guess how it survived, as it were, the invasion,
in that bed the car-thief had suffered unspeakable pain, perhaps that is
why it had retained an aura of suffering that kept people at a distance.
These are the workings of destiny, arcane mysteries, and this
coincidence was not the first, far from it, we need only observe that
all the eye-patients who happened to be in the surgery when the first
blind man appeared there have ended up in this ward, and even then it
was thought that the situation would go no further, In a low voice, as
always, so that no one would suspect the secret of her presence there,
the doctor’s wife whispered into her husband’s ear, Perhaps he was also
one of your patients, he is an elderly man, bald, with white hair, and
he has a black patch over one eye, I remember you telling me about him,
Which eye, The left, It must be him. The doctor advanced to the
passageway and said, slightly raising his voice, I’d like to touch the
person who has just joined us, I would ask him to make his way in this
direction and I shall make my way towards him. They bumped into each
other midway, fingers touching fingers, like two ants that recognise
each other from the manoeuvring of their antennae, but this won’t be the
case here, the doctor asked his permission, ran his hands over the old
man’s face, and quickly found the patch. There is no doubt, here is the
one person who was missing here, the patient with the black patch, he
exclaimed, What do you mean, who are you, asked the old man, I am, or
rather I was your ophthalmologist, do you remember, we were agreeing on
a date for your cataract operation, How did you recognise me, Above all,
by your voice, the voice is the sight of the person who cannot see, Yes,
the voice, I’m also beginning to recognise yours, who would have thought
it, doctor, now there’s no need for an operation, If there is a cure for
this, we will both need it, I remember you telling me, doctor, that
after my operation I would no longer recognise the world in which I was
living, we now know how right you were, When did you turn blind, Last
night, And they’ve brought you here already, The panic out there is such
that it won’t be long before they start killing people off the moment
they know they have gone blind, Here they have already eliminated ten,
said a man’s voice, I found them, the old man with the black eyepatch
simply said, They were from the other ward, we buried our dead at once,
added the same voice, as if concluding a report. The girl with dark
glasses had approached, Do you remember me, I was wearing dark glasses,
I remember you well, despite my cataract, I remember that you were very
pretty, the girl smiled, Thank you, she said, and went back to her
place. From there, she called out, The little boy is here too, I want my
mummy, the boy’s voice could be heard saying, as if worn out from some
remote and useless weeping. And I was the first to go blind, said the
first blind man, and I’m here with my wife, And I’m the girl from the
surgery, said the girl from the surgery. The doctor’s wife said, It only
remains for me to introduce myself, and she said who she was. Then the
old man, as if to repay the welcome, announced, I have a radio, A radio,
exclaimed the girl with dark glasses as she clapped her hands, music,
how nice, Yes, but it’s a small radio, with batteries, and batteries do
not last forever, the old man reminded her, Don’t tell me we shall be
cooped up here forever, said the first blind man, Forever, no, forever
is always far too long a time, We’ll be able to listen to the news, the
doctor observed, And a little music, insisted the girl with dark
glasses, Not everyone likes the same music, but we’re all certainly
interested in knowing what things are like outside, it would be better
to save the radio for that, I agree, said the old man with the black
eyepatch. He took the tiny radio from his jacket pocket and switched it
on. He began searching for the different stations, but his hand was
still too unsteady to tune into one wavelength, and to begin with all
that could be heard were intermittent noises, fragments of music and
words, at last his hand grew steadier, the music became recognisable,
Leave it there for a bit, pleaded the girl with dark glasses, the words
got clearer, That isn’t the news, said the doctor’s wife, and then, as
if an idea had suddenly struck her, What time is it, she asked, but she
knew that no one there could tell her. The tuning knob continued to
extract noises from the tiny box, then it settled down, it was a song, a
song of no significance, but the blind internees slowly began gathering
round, without pushing, they stopped the moment they felt a presence
before them and there they remained, listening, their eyes wide open
tuned in the direction of the voice that was singing, some were crying,
as probably only the blind can cry, the tears simply flowing as from a
fountain. The song came to an end, the announcer said, At the third
stroke it will be four o’clock. One of the blind women asked, laughing,
Four in the afternoon or four in the morning, and it was as if her
laughter hurt her. Furtively, the doctor’s wife adjusted her watch and
wound it up, it was four in the afternoon, although, to tell the truth,
a watch is unconcerned, it goes from one to twelve, the rest are just
ideas in the human mind. What’s that faint sound, asked the girl with
dark glasses, it sounded like, It was me, I heard them say on the radio
that it was four o’clock and I wound up my watch, it was one of those
automatic movements we so often make, anticipated the doctor’s wife.
Then she thought that it had not been worth putting herself at risk like
that, all she had to do was to glance at the wrist-watches of the blind
who had arrived that day, one of them must have a watch in working
order. The old man with the black eyepatch had one, as she noticed just
that moment, and the time on his watch was correct. Then the doctor
asked, Tell us what the situation is like out there. The old man with
the black eyepatch said, Of course, but I’d better sit, I’m dead on my
feet. Three or four to a bed, keeping each other company on this
occasion, the blind internees settled down as best they could, they fell
silent, and then the old man with the black eye-patch told them what he
knew, what he had seen with his own eyes when he could still see, what
he had overheard during the few days that elapsed between the start of
the epidemic and his own blindness.</p>
<p>In the first twenty-four hours, he said, if the rumour going round
was true, there were hundreds of cases, all alike, all showing the same
symptoms, all instantaneous, the disconcerting absence of lesions, the
resplendent whiteness of their field of vision, no pain either before or
after. On the second day there was talk of some reduction in the number
of new cases, it went from hundreds to dozens and this led the
Government to announce at once that it was reasonable to suppose that
the situation would soon be under control. From this point onwards,
apart from a few inevitable comments, the story of the old man with the
black eyepatch will no longer be followed to the letter, being replaced
by a reorganised version of his discourse, re-evaluated in the light of
a correct and more appropriate vocabulary. The reason for this
previously unforeseen change is the rather formal controlled language,
used by the narrator, which almost disqualifies him as a complementary
reporter, however important he may be, because without him we would have
no way of knowing what happened in the outside world, as a complementary
reporter, as we were saying, of these extraordinary events, when as we
know the description of any facts can only gain with the rigour and
suitability of the terms used. Returning to the matter in hand, the
Government therefore ruled out the originally formulated hypothesis that
the country was being swept by an epidemic without precedent, provoked
by some morbid as yet unidentified agent that took effect
instantaneously and was marked by a complete absence of any previous
signs of incubation or latency. Instead, they said, that in accordance
with the latest scientific opinion and the consequent and updated
administrative interpretation, they were dealing with an accidental and
unfortunate temporary concurrence of circumstances, also as yet
unverified, in whose pathogenic development it was possible, the
Government’s communiqué emphasised, starting from the analysis of the
available data, to detect the proximity of a clear curve of resolution
and signs that it was on the wane. A television commentator came up with
an apt metaphor when he compared the epidemic, or whatever it might be,
to an arrow shot into the air, which upon reaching its highest point,
pauses for a moment as if suspended, and then begins to trace its
obligatory descending curve, which, God willing, and with this
invocation the commentator returned to the triviality of human discourse
and to the so-called epidemic, gravity tending to increase the speed of
it, until this terrible nightmare tormenting us finally disappears,
these were words that appeared constantly in the media, and always
concluded by formulating the pious wish that the unfortunate people who
had become blind might soon recover their sight, promising them
meanwhile, the solidarity of society as a whole, both official and
private. In some remote past, similar arguments and metaphors had been
translated by the intrepid optimism of the common people into sayings
such as, Nothing lasts forever, be it good or bad, the excellent maxims
of one who has had time to learn from the ups and downs of life and
fortune, and which, transported into the land of the blind, should be
read as follows, Yesterday we could see, today we can’t, tomorrow we
shall see again, with a slight interrogatory note on the third and final
line of the phrase, as if prudence, at the last moment, had decided,
just in case, to add a touch of a doubt to the hopeful conclusion.</p>
<p>Sadly, the futility of such hopes soon became manifest, the
Government’s expectations and the predictions of the scientific
community simply sank without trace. Blindness was spreading, not like a
sudden tide flooding everything and carrying all before it, but like an
insidious infiltration of a thousand and one turbulent rivulets which,
having slowly drenched the earth, suddenly submerge it completely. Faced
with this social catastrophe, already on the point of taking the bit
between their teeth, the authorities hastily organised medical
conferences, especially those bringing together ophthalmologists and
neurologists. Because of the time it would inevitably take to organise,
a congress that some had called for was never convened, but in
compensation there were colloquia, seminars, round-table discussions,
some open to the public, others held behind closed doors. The overall
effect of the patent futility of the debates and the occurrence of
certain cases of sudden blindness during the sessions, with the speaker
calling out, I’m blind, I’m blind, prompted almost all the newspapers,
the radio and television, to lose interest in such initiatives, apart
from the discreet and, in every sense, laudable behaviour of certain
organs of communication which, living off sensational stories of every
kind, off the fortunes and misfortunes of others, were not prepared to
miss an opportunity to report live, with all the drama the situation
warranted, the sudden blindness, for example, of a professor of
ophthalmology.</p>
<p>The proof of the progressive deterioration of morale in general was
provided by the Government itself, its strategy changing twice within
the space of some six days. To begin with, the Government was confident
that it was possible to circumscribe the disease by confining the blind
and the contaminated within specific areas, such as the asylum in which
we find ourselves. Then the inexorable rise in the number of cases of
blindness led some influential members of the Government, fearful that
the official initiative would not suffice for the task in hand, and that
it might result in heavy political costs, to defend the idea that it was
up to families to keep their blind indoors, never allowing them to go
out on the street, so as not to worsen the already difficult traffic
situation or to offend the sensibility of persons who still had their
eyesight and who, indifferent to more or less reassuring opinions,
believed that the white disease was spreading by visual contact, like
the evil eye. Indeed, it was not appropriate to expect any other
reaction from someone who, preoccupied with his thoughts, be they sad,
indifferent, or happy, if such thoughts still exist, suddenly saw the
change in expression of a person heading in his direction, his face
revealing all the signs of total horror, and then that inevitable cry,
I’m blind, I’m blind. No one’s nerves could withstand it. The worst
thing is that whole families, especially the smaller ones, rapidly
became families of blind people, leaving no one who could guide and look
after them, nor protect sighted neighbours from them, and it was clear
that these blind people, however caring a father, mother or child they
might be, could not take care of each other, otherwise they would meet
the same fate as the blind people in the painting, walking together,
falling together and dying together.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, the Government had no alternative but to
go rapidly into reverse gear, broadening the criteria it had established
about the places and spaces that could be requisitioned, resulting in
the immediate and improvised utilisation of abandoned factories, disused
churches, sports pavilions and empty warehouses. For the last two days
there has been talk of setting up army tents, added the old man with the
black eye-patch. At the beginning, the very beginning, several
charitable organisations were still offering volunteers to assist the
blind, to make their beds, clean out the lavatories, wash their clothes,
prepare their food, the minimum of care without which life soon becomes
unbearable, even for those who can see. These dear people went blind
immediately but at least the generosity of their gesture would go down
in history. Did any of them come here, asked the old man with the black
eyepatch, No, replied the doctor’s wife, no one has come, Perhaps it was
a rumour, And what about the city and the traffic, asked the first blind
man, remembering his own car and that of the taxi-driver who had driven
him to the surgery and had helped him to dig the grave, Traffic is in a
state of chaos, replied the old man with the black eyepatch, and gave
details of specific cases and accidents. When, for the first time, a
bus-driver was suddenly struck by blindness as he was driving his
vehicle on a public road, despite the casualties and injuries resulting
from the disaster, people did not pay much attention for the same
reason, that is to say, out of force of habit, and the director of
public relations of the transport company felt able to declare, without
further ado, that the disaster had been caused by human error,
regrettable no doubt, but, all things considered, as unforeseeable as a
heart attack in the case of someone who had never suffered from a heart
complaint. Our employees, explained the director, as well as the
mechanical and electrical parts of our buses, are periodically subjected
to rigorous checks, as can be seen, showing a direct and clear relation
of cause and effect, in the extremely low percentage of accidents in
which, generally speaking, our company’s vehicles have been involved.
This laboured explanation appeared in the newspapers, but people had
more on their minds than worrying about a simple bus accident, after
all, it would have been no worse if its brakes had failed. Moreover, two
days later, this was precisely the cause of another accident, but the
world being what it is, where the truth often has to masquerade as
falsehood to achieve its ends, the rumour went round that the driver had
gone blind. There was no way of convincing the public of what had in
fact happened, and the out come was soon evident, from one moment to the
next people stopped using buses, they said they would rather go blind
themselves than die because others had gone blind. A third accident,
soon afterwards and for the same reason, involving a vehicle that was
carrying no passengers, gave rise to comment such as the following,
couched in a knowingly popular tone, That could have been me. Nor could
they imagine, those who spoke like this, how right they were. When two
pilots both went blind at once a commercial plane crashed and burst into
flames the moment it hit the ground, killing all the passengers and
crew, notwithstanding that in this case, the mechanical and electrical
equipment were in perfect working order, as the black box, the only
survivor, would later reveal. A tragedy of these dimensions was not the
same as an ordinary bus accident, the result being that those who still
had any illusions soon lost them, from then on engine noises were no
longer heard and no wheel, large or small, fast or slow, was ever to
turn again. Those people who were previously in the habit of complaining
about the ever-increasing traffic problems, pedestrians who, at first
sight, appeared not to know where they were going because the cars,
stationary or moving, were constantly impeding their progress, drivers
who having gone round the block countless times before finally finding a
place to park their car, became pedestrians and started protesting for
the same reasons, after having first voiced their own complaints, all of
them must now be content, except for the obvious fact that, since there
was no one left who dared to drive a vehicle, not even to get from A to
B, the cars, trucks, motor-bikes, even the bicycles, were scattered
chaotically throughout the entire city, abandoned wherever fear had
gained the upper hand over any sense of propriety, as evidenced by the
grotesque sight of a tow-away vehicle with a car suspended from the
front axle, probably the first man to turn blind had been the
truck-driver. The situation was bad for everyone, but for those stricken
with blindness it was catastrophic, since, according to the current
expression, they could not see where they were putting their feet. It
was pitiful to watch them bumping into the abandoned cars, one after the
other, bruising their shins, some fell, pleading, Is there anyone who
can help me to my feet, but there were also those who, naturally brutish
or made so by despair, cursed and fought off any helping hand that came
to their assistance, Leave me alone, your turn will come soon enough,
then the compassionate person would take fright and make a quick escape,
disappear into that dense white mist, suddenly conscious of the risk to
which their kindness had exposed them, perhaps to go blind only a few
steps further on.</p>
<p>That’s how things are out there, the old man with the black eyepatch
concluded his account, and I don’t know everything, I can only speak of
what I was able to see with my own eyes, here he broke off, paused and
corrected himself, Not with my eyes, because I only had one, now not
even that, well, I still have it but it’s no use to me, I’ve never asked
you why you didn’t have a glass eye instead of wearing that patch, And
why should I have wanted to, tell me that, asked the old man with the
black eye-patch, It’s normal because it looks better, besides it’s much
more hygienic, it can be removed, washed and replaced like dentures, Yes
sir, but tell me what it would be like today if all those who now find
themselves blind had lost, I say physically lost, both their eyes, what
good would it do them now to be walking around with two glass eyes,
You’re right, no good at all, With all of us ending up blind, as appears
to be happening, who’s interested in aesthetics, and as for hygiene,
tell me, doctor, what kind of hygiene could you hope for in this place,
Perhaps only in a world of the blind will things be what they truly are,
said the doctor, And what about people, asked the girl with dark
glasses, People, too, no one will be there to see them, An idea has just
occurred to me, said the old man with the black eye-patch, let’s play a
game to pass the time, How can we play a game if we cannot see what we
are playing, asked the wife of the first blind man, Well, not a game
exactly, each of us must say what we saw at the moment we went blind,
That could be embarrassing, someone pointed out, Those who do not wish
to take part in the game can remain silent, the important thing is that
no one should try to invent anything, Give us an example, said the
doctor, Certainly, replied the old man with the black eye-patch, I went
blind when I was looking at my blind eye, What do you mean, It’s very
simple, I felt as if the inside of the empty orbit were inflamed and I
removed the patch to satisfy my curiosity and just at that moment I went
blind, It sounds like an allegory, said an unknown voice, the eye that
refuses to acknowledge its own absence, As for me, said the doctor, I
was at home consulting some reference books on ophthalmology, precisely
because of what is happening, the last thing I saw were my hands resting
on a book, My final image was different, said the doctor’s wife, the
inside of an ambulance as I was helping my husband to get in, I’ve
already explained to the doctor what happened to me, said the first
blind man, I had stopped at the lights, the signal was red, there were
people crossing the street from one side to the other, at that very
moment I turned blind, then that fellow who died the other day took me
home, obviously I couldn’t see his face, As for me, said the wife of the
first blind man, the last thing I can remember seeing was my
handkerchief, I was sitting at home and crying my heart out, I raised
the handkerchief to my eyes and went blind that very moment, In my case,
said the girl from the surgery, I had just gotten into the elevator, I
stretched out my hand to press the button and suddenly stopped seeing,
you can imagine my distress, trapped in there and all alone, I didn’t
know whether I would go up or down, and I couldn’t find the button to
open the door, My situation, said the pharmacist’s assistant, was
simpler, I heard that people were going blind, then I began to wonder
what it would be like if I too were to go blind, I closed my eyes to try
it and when I opened them I was blind, Sounds like another allegory,
interrupted the unknown voice, if you want to be blind, then blind you
will be. They remained silent. The other blind internees had gone back
to their beds, no easy task, for while it is true that they knew their
respective numbers, only by starting to count from one end of the ward,
from one upwards or from twenty downwards, could they be certain of
arriving where they wanted to be. When the murmur of their counting, as
monotonous as a litany, died away, the girl with dark glasses related
what had happened to her, I was in a hotel room with a man lying on top
of me, at that point she fell silent, she felt too ashamed to say what
she was doing there, that she had seen everything white, but the old man
with the black eyepatch asked, And you saw everything white, Yes, she
replied, Perhaps your blindness is different from ours, said the old man
with the black eyepatch. The only person still to speak was the
chambermaid, I was making a bed, a certain person had gone blind there,
I held up the white sheet up before me and spread it out, tucked it in
at the sides as one does, and as I was smoothing it out with both hands,
suddenly I could no longer see, I remember how I was smoothing the sheet
out, very slowly, it was the bottom sheet, she added, as if this had
some special significance. Has everyone told their story about the last
time they could see, asked the old man with the black eyepatch, I’ll
tell you mine, if there’s no one else, said the unknown voice, If there
is, he can speak after you, so fire away, The last thing I saw was a
painting, A painting, repeated the old man with the black eyepatch, and
where was this painting, I had gone to the museum, it was a picture of a
cornfield with crows and cypress trees and a sun that gave the
impression of having been made up of the fragments of other suns, Sounds
like a Dutch painter, I think it was, but there was a drowning dog in
it, already half submerged, poor creature, In that case it must be by a
Spanish painter, before him no one had ever painted a dog in that
situation, after him no other painter had the courage to try. Probably,
and there was a cart laden with hay, drawn by horses and crossing a
stream, Was there a house on the left, Yes, Then it was by an English
painter, Could be, but I don’t think so, because there was a woman as
well with a child in her arms, Mothers and children are all too common
in paintings, True, I’ve noticed, What I don’t understand is how in one
painting there should be so many pictures and by such different
painters, And there were some men eating, There have been so many
lunches, afternoon snacks and suppers in the history of art, that this
detail in itself is not enough to tell us who was eating, There were
thirteen men altogether, Ah, then it’s easy, go on, There was also a
naked woman with fair hair, inside a conch that was floating on the sea,
and masses of flowers around her, Obviously Italian, And there was a
battle, As in those paintings depicting banquets and mothers with
children in their arms, these details are not enough to reveal who
painted the picture, There were corpses and wounded men, It’s only
natural, sooner or later, all children die, and soldiers too, And a
horse stricken with terror, With its eyes about to pop out of their
sockets, Exactly, Horses are like that, and what other pictures were
there in your painting, Alas, I never managed to find out, I went blind
just as I was looking at the horse. Fear can cause blindness, said the
girl with dark glasses, Never a truer word, that could not be truer, we
were already blind the moment we turned blind, fear struck us blind,
fear will keep us blind, Who is speaking, asked the doctor, A blind man,
replied a voice, just a blind man, for that is all we have here. Then
the old man with the black eye-patch asked, How many blind persons are
needed to make a blindness, No one could provide the answer. The girl
with dark glasses asked him to switch on the radio, there might be some
news. They gave the news later, meanwhile they listened to a little
music. At a certain point some blind internees appeared in the doorway
of the ward, one of them said, What a pity no one thought of bringing a
guitar. The news was not very encouraging, a rumour was going round that
the formation of a government of unity and national salvation was
imminent.</p>
