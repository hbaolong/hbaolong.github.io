<h4 id="section">17</h4>
<p>The next day, while still in bed, the doctor’s wife said to her
husband, We have little food left, we’ll have to go out again, I thought
that today I would go back to the underground food store at the
supermarket, the one I went to on the first day, if nobody else has
found it, we can get supplies for a week or two, I’m coming with you and
we’ll ask one or two of the others to come along as well, I’d rather go
with you alone, it’s easier, and there is less danger of getting lost,
How long will you be able to carry the burden of six helpless people,
I’ll manage as long as I can, but you are quite right, I’m beginning to
get exhausted, sometimes I even wish I were blind as well, to be the
same as the others, to have no more obligations than they have, We’ve
got used to depending on you, If you weren’t there, it would be like
being struck with a second blindness, thanks to your eyes we are a
little less blind, I’ll carry on as long as I can, I can’t promise you
more than that, One day, when we realise that we can no longer do
anything good and useful we ought to have the courage simply to leave
this world, as he said, Who said that, The fortunate man we met
yesterday, I am sure that he wouldn’t say that today, there is nothing
like real hope to change one’s opinions, He has that all right, long may
it last, In your voice there is a tone which makes me think you are
upset, Upset, why, As if something had been taken away from you, Are you
referring to what happened to the girl when we were at that terrible
place, Yes, Remember, it was she who wanted to have sex with me, Memory
is deceiving you, you wanted her, Are you sure, I was not blind, Well, I
would have sworn that, You would only perjure yourself, Strange how
memory can deceive us, In this case it is easy to see, something that is
offered to us is more ours than something we had to conquer, But she
didn’t ever approach me again, and I never approached her, If you wanted
to, you could find each other’s memories, that’s what memory is for, You
are jealous, No, I’m not jealous, I was not even jealous on that
occasion, I felt sorry for her and for you, and also for myself because
I could not help you, How are we fixed for water, Badly. After the
extremely frugal breakfast, lightened by some discrete, smiling hints at
the events of the previous night, the words appropriately veiled out of
consideration for the presence of a minor, an odd precaution if we
remember the terrible scenes that he witnessed during the quarantine,
the doctor’s wife and her husband set off, accompanied this time only by
the dog of tears, who did not want to stay at home.</p>
<p>The state of the streets got worse with every passing hour. The
rubbish seemed to increase during the hours of darkness, it was as if
from the outside, from some unknown country where there was still a
normal life, they were coming in the night to empty their trash cans, if
we were not in the land of the blind we would see through the middle of
this white darkness phantom carts and trucks loaded with refuse, debris,
rubble, chemical waste, ashes, burnt oil, bones, bottles, offal, flat
batteries, plastic bags, mountains of paper, what they don’t bring is
leftover food, not even bits of fruit peel with which we might be able
to allay our hunger, while waiting for those better days that are always
just around the corner. It is still early in the morning but the heat is
already oppressive. The stench rises from the enormous refuse pile like
a cloud of toxic gas, It won’t be long before we have outbreaks of
epidemics, said the doctor again, nobody will escape, we have no
defences left, If it’s not raining, it’s blowing gales, said the woman,
Not even that, the rain would at least quench our thirst, and the wind
would blow away some of this stench. The dog of tears sniffs around
restlessly, stops to investigate a particular heap of rubbish, perhaps
there was a rare delicacy hidden underneath which it can no longer find,
if it were alone it would not move an inch from this spot, but the woman
who wept has already walked on, and it is his duty to follow her, one
never knows when one might have to dry more tears. Walking is difficult,
in some streets, especially the steep ones, the heavy rainwater,
transformed into torrents, had thrown cars against other cars or against
buildings, knocking down doors, smashing shop windows, the ground is
covered with thick pieces of broken glass. Wedged in between two cars
the body of a man is rotting away. The doctor’s wife averts her eyes.
The dog of tears moves closer, but death frightens it, it still takes
two steps forward, suddenly its fur stands on end, a piercing howl
escapes from its throat, the trouble with this dog is that it has grown
too close to human beings, it will suffer as they do. They crossed a
square where groups of blind people entertained themselves by listening
to speeches from other blind people, at first sight neither group seemed
to be blind, the speakers turned their heads excitedly towards the
listeners and the listeners turned their heads attentively to the
speakers. They were extolling the virtues of the fundamental principles
of the great organised systems, private property, a free currency
market, the market economy, the stock exchange, taxation, interest,
expropriation and appropriation, production, distribution, consumption,
supply and demand, poverty and wealth, communication, repression and
delinquency, lotteries, prisons, the penal code, the civil code, the
highway code, dictionaries, the telephone directory, networks of
prostitution, armaments factories, the armed forces, cemeteries, the
police, smuggling, drugs, permitted illegal traffic, pharmaceutical
research, gambling, the price of priests and funerals, justice,
borrowing, political parties, elections, parliaments, governments,
convex, concave, horizontal, vertical, slanted, concentrated, diffuse,
fleeting thoughts, the fraying of the vocal cords, the death of the
word. Here they are talking about organisation, said the doctor’s wife
to her husband, I noticed, he answered, and said no more. They continued
walking, the doctor’s wife went to consult a street plan on a street
corner, like an old roadside cross pointing the way. We are very close
to the supermarket, around here she had broken down and wept the day
that she had got lost, grotesquely weighed down by the plastic bags
which luckily were full to the brim, in her confusion and anguish she
had to depend on a dog to console her, the same dog who is here snarling
at the packs of other dogs who are coming too close, as if it were
telling them, You don’t fool me, keep away from here. A street to the
left, another to the right and there is the entrance to the supermarket.
Only the door, that’s it, there is the door, there is the whole
building, but what cannot be seen are people going in and coming out,
that ant-heap of people which we find at all hours in these shops that
live on the comings and goings of vast crowds. The doctor’s wife feared
the worst and said to her husband, We have arrived too late, there won’t
be a crumb left in there, Why do you say that, I don’t see anybody going
in or coming out, Perhaps they have not yet discovered the basement
storeroom, That’s what I am hoping for. They were standing on the
pavement opposite the supermarket when they spoke these words. Beside
them, as if they were waiting for the traffic lights to turn green,
there were three blind people. The doctor’s wife did not notice the
expression on their faces, which was of puzzled surprise, a kind of
confused fear, she did not see that one of them opened his mouth to
speak and then closed it again, she did not notice the sudden shrug of
shoulders, You’ll find out, we assume the blind man was thinking. As
they were crossing the middle of the road, the doctor’s wife and her
husband were unable to hear the comment of the second blind person, Why
did she say that she did not see, that she did not see anybody going in
or coming out, and the third blind person answered, It’s just a manner
of speaking, a moment ago, when I stumbled you told me to watch where I
was putting my feet, it’s the same thing, we still haven’t lost the
habit of seeing, Oh God, how many times have I heard that before,
exclaimed the first blind man.</p>
<p>The daylight illuminated the whole of the wide hall of the
supermarket. Almost all the shelves were overturned, there was nothing
but refuse, broken glass, empty wrappers, It is strange, said the
doctor’s wife, even if there is no food here, I don’t understand why
there is nobody around. The doctor said, You are right, it does not seem
normal. The dog of tears whimpered softly. Its hair was standing on end
again. The doctor’s wife said to her husband, There is a bad smell in
here, There’s a bad smell everywhere, said the husband, It’s not that,
it’s another smell, of rotting, There must be a dead body somewhere, I
don’t see anything, In which case you must be imagining it. The dog
began to whine. What’s the matter with the dog, asked the doctor, He’s
nervous, What are we going to do, Let’s see, if there is a corpse we
just give it a wide berth, at this stage the dead no longer frighten us,
For me it’s easier, I can’t see them. They crossed the hall of the
supermarket until they reached the door which opened on to the corridor
leading to the basement store. The dog of tears followed them, but it
stopped from time to time, howled to them, then duty obliged it to
continue. When the doctor’s wife opened the door, the stench grew
stronger, It smells terrible, said her husband, You stay here, I’ll be
right back. She went down the corridor, it became darker with every step
and the dog of tears followed her as if it were being dragged along.
Filled with the stench of putrefaction, the air seemed thick. Halfway
down, the woman vomited, What can have happened here, she thought
between retchings and then she murmured these same words over and over
again until she got to the metal door which went down into the basement.
Confused by her nausea, she had not noticed before that there was a
tenuous shimmer of light down there. Now she knew what it was. Small
flames flickered around the edges of the two doors, that of the
staircase and that of the goods lift. A new attack of vomiting gripped
her stomach, it was so violent that it attracted the attention of the
dog. The dog of tears gave a very long howl, it let out a wail that
seemed never-ending, a lament which resounded through the corridor like
the last voice of the dead down in the basement. The doctor heard the
vomiting, the convulsions, the coughing, he ran as well as he could, he
stumbled and fell, he got up and fell again, at last he held his wife in
his arms, What happened, he asked, with a trembling voice she replied,
Get me out of here, please, get me out of here, for the first time since
the onset of blindness, it was the doctor who guided his wife, he guided
her without knowing where, anywhere away from those doors, those flames
that he could not see. When they had got out of the corridor, her nerves
suddenly went to pieces, her sobbing became convulsive, there is no
drying tears like these, only time and exhaustion can stop them,
therefore the dog did not approach, it just looked for a hand to lick.
What happened, the doctor asked again, what did you see, They are dead,
she managed to say between sobs, Who is dead, They are, and she could
not go on. Calm yourself, tell me when you can. A few minutes later she
said, They are dead, Did you see anything, did you open the door, asked
her husband, No, I only saw will-o’-the-wisps around the doors, they
clung there and danced around and did not let go, I think it must have
been phosphorised hydrogen as a result of the decomposition of the
bodies, What could have happened, They must have found the basement,
rushed down the stairs looking for food, I remember how easy it was to
slip and fall on those steps, and if one fell, they would all fall, they
probably never reached where they wanted to go, or if they did they
could not return because of the obstruction on the staircase, But you
said that the door was closed, Most likely other blind people closed it,
converting the basement into an enormous tomb and I am to blame for what
happened, when I came running out of there with my bags, they must have
suspected that it was food and went in search of it, In a way,
everything we eat has been stolen from the mouths of others and if we
rob them of too much we are responsible for their death, one way or
another we are all murderers, A small consolation, I don’t want you to
start burdening yourself with imaginary guilt, when you already have a
hard enough time shouldering the responsibility for six real and useless
mouths, How could I live without your useless mouth, You would live in
order to support the other five who are there, The question is, for how
long. It won’t be for much longer, when everything is finished we shall
have to roam the fields in search of food, we’ll pick all the fruit from
the trees, we’ll kill all the animals we can lay our hands on, if in the
meantime dogs and cats do not start devouring us. The dog of tears did
not react, this matter did not concern it, its recent transformation
into a dog of tears had not been in vain.</p>
<p>The doctor’s wife could hardly drag herself along. The shock had
robbed her of all her strength. When they left the supermarket, she
fainting, he blind, neither would be able to say who was assisting the
other. Perhaps the intensity of the light had made her dizzy, she
thought that she was losing her eyesight, but she was not afraid, it was
only a fainting fit. She did not fall, nor even lose consciousness. She
needed to lie down, close her eyes, breathe steadily, if she could just
rest for a few minutes she was sure that she would regain her strength,
she had to, her plastic bags were still empty. She did not want to lie
down on the filth in the street, or return to the supermarket, not even
dead. She looked around. On the other side of the street, a bit further
on, was a church. There would be people inside, as everywhere, but it
would be a good place to rest, at least it always had been. She said to
her husband, I need to recover my strength, take me over there, There,
where, I’m sorry, bear with me, and I’ll tell you, What is it, A church,
if I could only lie down for a while, I’d feel like new, Let’s go. Six
steps led up to the church, six steps, which the doctor’s wife climbed
with great difficulty, especially since she also had to guide her
husband. The doors were wide open, which was a great help, a revolving
door, even of the simplest type, would on this occasion have been a
difficult obstacle to overcome. The dog of tears hesitated on the
threshold. Despite the freedom of movement enjoyed by dogs in recent
months, all of them had genetically programmed into their brains the
prohibition which once, long ago, fell on the species, that on entering
churches, probably because of that other genetic code which obliges them
to mark their territory wherever they go. The good and faithful services
rendered by the forebears of this dog of tears, when they licked the
festering sores of saints before they were recognised and approved as
such, nevertheless acts of compassion of the most selfless kind,
because, as we well know, not just any beggar can become a saint, no
matter how many wounds he may have on his body, and in his soul too
where the tongues of dogs cannot reach. The dog now had the courage to
enter the sacred space, the door was open, there was no doorkeeper, and
the strongest reason of all, the woman who had wept had already gone in,
I do not know how she manages to drag herself along, she murmurs but a
single word to her husband, Hold me, the church is full, it is almost
impossible to find even a foot of floor unoccupied, one might literally
say that there is no stone upon which to rest one’s head, again the dog
of tears proved its usefulness, with two growls and a couple of charges,
all without malice, it opened up a space where the doctor’s wife let
herself fall, giving in to the faint, at last fully closing her eyes.
Her husband took her pulse, it is firm and regular, only a little faint,
then he tried to lift her up, she’s not in a good position, it is
important to get the blood back into the brain quickly, to increase the
cerebral irrigation, the best thing would be to sit her up, put her head
between her knees and trust to nature and the force of gravity. At last,
after some failed attempts, he managed to lift her up. A few minutes
later, the doctor’s wife gave a deep sigh, moved almost imperceptibly,
and started to regain consciousness. Don’t get up just yet, her husband
told her, keep your head down for a while longer, but she felt fine,
there was no sign of vertigo, her eyes could already distinguish the
tiles on the floor which the dog of tears had left reasonably clean
thanks to his energetic scrabbling before lying down himself. She raised
her head to the slender pillars, to the high vaults, to confirm the
security and stability of her blood circulation, then she said, I am
feeling fine, but at that very moment she thought she had gone mad or
that the lifting of the vertigo had given her hallucinations, it could
not be true what her eyes revealed, that man nailed to the cross with a
white bandage covering his eyes, and next to him a woman, her heart
pierced by seven swords and her eyes also covered with a white bandage,
and it was not only that man and that woman who were in that condition,
all the images in the church had their eyes covered, statues with a
white cloth tied around the head, paintings with a thick brushstroke of
white paint, and there was a woman teaching her daughter how to read and
both had their eyes covered, and a man with an open book on which a
little child was sitting, and both had their eyes covered, and another
man, his body spiked with arrows, and he had his eyes covered, and a
woman with a lit lamp, and she had her eyes covered, and a man with
wounds on his hands and feet and his chest, and he had his eyes covered,
and another man with a lion, and both had their eyes covered, and
another man with a lamb, and both had their eyes covered, and another
man with an eagle, and both had their eyes covered, and another man with
a spear standing over a fallen man with horns and cloven feet, and both
had their eyes covered, and another man carrying a set of scales, and he
had his eyes covered, and an old bald man holding a white lily, and he
had his eyes covered, and another old man leaning on an unsheathed
sword, and he had his eyes covered, and a woman with a dove, and both
had their eyes covered, and a man with two ravens, and all three had
their eyes covered, there was only one woman who did not have her eyes
covered, because she carried her gouged-out eyes on a silver tray. The
doctor’s wife said to her husband, You won’t believe me if I tell you
what I have in front of my eyes, all the images in this church have
their eyes covered, How strange, I wonder why, How should I know,
perhaps it was the work of someone whose faith was badly shaken when he
realised that he would be blind like the others, maybe it was even the
local priest, perhaps he thought that when the blind people could no
longer see the images, the images should not be able to see the blind
either, Images don’t see, You’re wrong, images see with the eyes of
those who see them, only that now blindness is the lot of everyone, You
can still see, I’ll see less and less all the time, even though I may
not lose my eyesight I shall become more and more blind because I shall
have no one to see me, If the priest covered the eyes of the images,
That’s just my idea, It’s the only hypothesis that makes any sense, it’s
the only one that can lend some dignity to our suffering, I imagine that
man coming in here from the world of the blind, where he would have to
return only to go blind himself, I imagine the closed doors, the
deserted church, the silence, I imagine the statues, the paintings, I
see him going from one to the other, climbing up to the altars and tying
the bandages with a double knot so that they do not come undone and slip
off, applying two coats of paint to the pictures in order to make the
white night into which they are plunged still thicker, that priest must
have committed the worst sacrilege of all times and all religions, the
fairest and most radically human, coming here to declare that,
ultimately, God does not deserve to see. The doctor’s wife did not have
a chance to reply, somebody beside her spoke first, What sort of talk is
that, who are you, Blind like you, she said, But I heard you say that
you could see, That’s just a manner of speaking which is hard to give
up, how many more times will I say it, And what’s this about the images
having their eyes covered, It’s true, And how do you know when you are
blind, You would know too if you did what I did, go and touch them with
your hands, the hands are the eyes of the blind, And why did you do it,
I thought that in order to have got to where we are someone else must
have been blind, And that story about the parish priest covering the
eyes of the images, I knew him very well, he would be incapable of doing
such a thing, You never know beforehand what people are capable of, you
have to wait, give it time, it’s time that rules, time is our gambling
partner on the other side of the table and it holds all the cards of the
deck in its hand, we have to guess the winning cards of life, our lives,
Speaking of gambling in a church is a sin, Get up, use your hands if you
doubt my words, Do you swear it is true that the images have their eyes
covered, What do you want me to swear on, Swear on your eyes, I swear
twice on the eyes, on yours and mine. Is it true, It’s true. The
conversation was overheard by the blind people in their immediate
vicinity, and it goes without saying that there was no need to wait for
the confirmation by oath before the news started to circulate, to pass
from mouth to mouth, in a murmur which shortly changed its tone, first
incredulous, then alarmed, again incredulous, it was unfortunate that
there were several superstitious and imaginative people in the
congregation, the idea that the sacred images were blind, that their
compassionate or pitying eyes only stared out at their own blindness,
became all of a sudden unbearable, it was tantamount to having told them
that they were surrounded by the living dead, one scream was enough,
then another and another, then fear made all the people rise up, panic
drove them to the doors, here the inevitable repeated itself, since
panic is much faster than the legs which carry it, the feet of the
fugitive trip up in their flight, even more so when one is blind, and
there he lies on the ground, panic tells him, Get up, run, they are
going to kill you, if only he could get up, but others have already run
and fallen too, you have to be strong-minded not to burst out laughing
at this grotesque entanglement of bodies looking for arms to free
themselves and for feet to get away. Those six steps outside will be
like a precipice, but finally, the fall will not be very serious, the
habit of falling hardens the body, reaching the ground is, in itself, a
relief, I’m staying where I am is the first thought, and sometimes the
last, in fatal cases. What does not change either is that some take
advantage of the misfortune of others, as is well known, since the
beginning of the world, the heirs and the heirs of the heirs. The
desperate flight of these people made them leave their belongings
behind, and when necessity conquers fear, they come back for them, then
the difficult problem will be to settle in a satisfactory manner what is
mine and what is yours, we shall see that some of the little food we had
has vanished, probably this was a cynical ruse on the part of the woman
who said that the images had their eyes covered, the depths some people
will stoop to, they invent such tall tales merely to rob poor people of
the few crumbs remaining to them. Now, the fault was the dog’s, seeing
the square empty it went foraging around, it rewarded itself for its
efforts, as was only fair and natural, and it showed, in a manner of
speaking, the entrance to the mine which meant that the doctor’s wife
and her husband left the church without remorse over the theft, with
their bags half full. If they can use half of what they grabbed they can
be content, regarding the other half they will say, I don’t know how
people can eat this, even when misfortune is common to all, there are
always some who have a worse time than others.</p>
<p>The report of these events, each one of its kind, left the other
members of the group aghast and confused, it has to be noted that the
doctor’s wife, perhaps because words failed her, did not even manage to
convey to them the feelings of utter horror she experienced at the
basement door, that rectangle of pale flickering lights at the top of
the staircase which led to the other world. The description of the
bandaged eyes of the images left a strong enough impression on their
imaginations, though in quite different ways, the first blind man and
his wife, for example, were rather uneasy, for them it was mainly an
unpardonable lack of respect. The fact that all human beings were blind
was a calamity for which they were not responsible, these are
misfortunes nobody can avoid, and for that reason alone covering the
eyes of the holy images struck them as an unpardonable offence, and if
the parish priest had done it, even worse. The reaction of the old man
with the black eyepatch was quite different, I can imagine the shock you
must have had, I imagine a museum in which all the sculptures have their
eyes covered, not because the sculptor did not want to carve the stone
until he reached the eyes, but covered, as you say, with bandages, as if
a single blindness were not enough, it’s strange that a patch like mine
does not create the same effect, sometimes it even gives people a
romantic air, and he laughed at what he had said and at himself. As to
the girl with the dark glasses, she said that she only hoped she would
not have to see this cursed gallery in her dreams, she had enough
nightmares already. They ate the rancid food at their disposal, it was
the best they had, the doctor’s wife said that it was becoming ever more
difficult to find food, perhaps they should leave the city and go to
live in the country, there at least the food they gathered would be
healthier, And there must be goats and cows on the loose, we can milk
them, we’ll have milk, and there is water from the wells, we can cook
what we want, the question is to find a good site, then everybody gave
his opinion, some more enthusiastic than others, but for all of them it
was obvious that the decision was pressing and urgent, the boy with the
squint expressed his approval without any reservations, possibly because
he retained pleasant memories from his holidays. After they had eaten,
they stretched out to sleep, they always did, even during the
quarantine, when experience taught them that a body in repose can put up
with a lot of hunger. That evening they did not eat, only the boy with
the squint got something to assuage his complaints and to allay his
hunger, the others sat down to hear the reading, at least their minds
would not be able to complain of lack of nourishment, the trouble is
that the weakness of the body sometimes leads to a lack of attention of
the mind, and it was not for lack of intellectual interest, no, what
happened was that the brain slipped into a half sleep, like an animal
settling down for hibernation, goodbye world, therefore it was not
uncommon that the listeners gently lowered their eyelids, forced
themselves to follow with the eyes of the soul the vicissitudes of the
plot until a more energetic passage shook them from their torpor, it was
not simply the noise of the book snapping shut, the doctor’s wife had
these subtle touches, she did not want to let on that she knew that the
dreamer was drifting off to sleep.</p>
<p>The first blind man appeared to have entered into this soft state,
but this was not the case. True, his eyes were closed, and he paid only
scant attention to the reading, but the idea that they would all go to
live in the country kept him from falling asleep, it seemed to him a
serious error to go so far from his home, however kind the writer was,
it would be useful to keep an eye on it, turn up from time to time. The
first blind man was therefore wide awake, if any other proof were needed
it would be the dazzling whiteness before his eyes, which probably only
sleep would darken, but one could not even be sure of that, since nobody
can be asleep and awake at the same time. The first blind man thought
that he had finally cleared up this doubt when suddenly the inside of
his eyelids turned dark, I’ve fallen asleep, he thought, but no, he had
not fallen asleep, he continued hearing the voice of the doctor’s wife,
the boy with the squint coughed, then a great fear entered his soul, he
thought he had passed from one blindness to another, that having lived
in the blindness of light, he would now pass into a blindness of
darkness, the fear made him tremble, What’s the matter, his wife asked,
and he replied stupidly, without opening his eyes, I am blind, as if
that were news, she tenderly held him in her arms, Don’t worry, we’re
all blind, there’s nothing we can do about it, I saw everything dark, I
thought I had gone to sleep, but I hadn’t, I am awake, That’s what you
should do, sleep, don’t think about it. He was annoyed by this advice,
here was a man in great distress, and his wife could say nothing other
than that he should sleep. He was irritated and, about to utter a harsh
reply, he opened his eyes and saw. He saw and shouted, I can see. His
first shout was still one of incredulity, but with the second and the
third and many more the evidence grew stronger, I can see, I can see, he
madly embraced his wife, then he ran to the doctor’s wife and embraced
her too, it was the first time he had seen her, but he knew who she was,
and the doctor, and the girl with dark glasses and the old man with the
black eyepatch, there was no mistaking him, and the boy with the squint,
his wife came behind him, she did not want to let him go, and he
interrupted his embraces to embrace her again, then he turned to the
doctor, I can see, I can see, doctor, he addressed him by his title,
something they had not done for a long time, and the doctor asked, Can
you see clearly, as before, are there no traces of whiteness, Nothing at
all, I even think that I can see better than before, and that’s no small
thing, I’ve never worn glasses. Then the doctor said what all of them
were thinking without daring to say it, It is possible that we have come
to the end of this blindness, it is possible that we will all recover
our eyesight, hearing those words, the doctor’s wife began to cry, she
should have been happy yet she was crying, what strange reactions people
have, of course she was happy, my God, it is easy to understand, she
cried because all her mental resistance had suddenly drained away, she
was like a new-born baby and this cry was her first and
still-unconscious sound. The dog of tears went up to her, it always
knows when it is needed, that’s why the doctor’s wife clung to him, it
is not that she no longer loved her husband, it is not that she did not
wish them all well, but at that moment her feeling of loneliness was so
intense, so unbearable, that it seemed to her that it could be overcome
only by the strange thirst with which the dog drank her tears.</p>
<p>The general joy turned into nervousness, And now, what are we going
to do, asked the girl with dark glasses, after all that has happened I
won’t be able to sleep, Nobody will, I believe we should stay here, said
the old man with the black eyepatch, he broke off as if he still had
some doubts, then he concluded, Waiting. They waited. The three flames
of the lamp lit up the circle of faces. At first, they had talked
animatedly, they wanted to know exactly what had happened, if the change
had taken place only in the eyes or whether he had also felt something
in his brain, then, little by little, their words grew despondent, at a
certain moment it occurred to the first blind man to say to his wife
that they would be going home the next day, But I am still blind, she
replied, It doesn’t matter, I’ll guide you, only those present who heard
it with their own ears could grasp how such simple words could contain
such different feelings as protection, pride and authority. The second
person to regain his eyesight, already late into the night, when the
lamp, running out of oil, was flickering, was the girl with dark
glasses. She had kept her eyes open as if sight had to enter through
them rather than be rekindled from within, suddenly she said, I think I
can see, it was best to be prudent, not all cases are the same, it even
used to be said there is no such thing as blindness, only blind people,
when the experience of time has taught us nothing other than that there
are no blind people, but only blindness. Here we already have three who
can see, one more and they would form a majority, but even though in the
happiness of seeing again we might ignore the others, their lives will
be very much easier, not the agony it was until today, look at the state
of that woman, she is like a rope that has broken, like a spring that
could no longer support the pressure it was constantly subjected to.
Perhaps it was for this reason that the girl with dark glasses embraced
her first, and the dog of tears did not know whose tears it should
attend to first, both of them wept so much. Her second embrace was for
the old man with the black eyepatch, now we shall know what words are
really worth, the other day we were so moved by the dialogue which led
to the splendid commitment by these two to live together, but the
situation has changed, the girl with dark glasses has before her an old
man whom she can now see in the flesh, the emotional idealisations, the
false harmonies on the desert island are over, wrinkles are wrinkles,
baldness is baldness, there is no difference between a black eyepatch
and a blind eye, that is what, in other words, he is going to say to
her. Look at me, I am the man you said you were going to live with, and
she replied, I know you, you’re the man I am living with, in the end
these are words that are worth even more than those that wanted to
surface, and this embrace as much as the words. The third one to regain
his sight the next day at dawn was the doctor, now there could no longer
be any doubt, it was only a question of time before the others would
recover theirs. Leaving aside the natural and foreseeable expansive
comments of which there has already been sufficient mention above, there
is now no need for repetition, even concerning the chief characters of
this narrative, the doctor asked the question which hung in the air,
What is happening out there, the reply came from the very building in
which they lived, on the floor below someone came out on the landing
shouting, I can see, I can see, it looks like the sun will rise over a
city in celebration.</p>
<p>The next morning’s meal turned into a banquet. What was on the table,
besides being very little, would repel any normal appetite, as happens
at all moments of elation, the strength of feelings took the place of
hunger and their happiness was the best nourishment, nobody complained,
even those who were still blind laughed as if the eyes which could
already see were theirs. When they had finished, the girl with dark
glasses had an idea, What if I now went to the door of my own flat with
a piece of paper saying that I’m here, my parents would know where to
find me if they return, Let me come with you, I want to know what is
happening out there, said the old man with the black eyepatch, And we
will go out too, said he who had been the first blind man to his wife,
Perhaps the writer can already see and is thinking about returning to
his own place, on the way I shall try to find something to eat. I’ll do
the same, said the girl with dark glasses. Minutes later, alone now, the
doctor sat down beside his wife, the boy with the squint was dozing in a
corner of the sofa, the dog of tears, stretched out with his muzzle on
its forepaws, opened and closed its eyes from time to time to show that
it was still watchful, through the open window, despite the fact that
they were so high up, the noise of excited voices could be heard, the
streets must be full of people, the crowd shouting just three words, I
can see, said those who had already recovered their eyesight and those
who were just starting to see, I can see, I can see, the story in which
people said, I am blind, truly appears to belong to another world. The
boy with the squint murmured, he must be in the middle of a dream,
perhaps he saw his mother and was asking her, Can you see me, can you
see me, The doctor’s wife asked, And the others, and the doctor
answered, He will probably be cured by the time he wakes, it will be the
same with the others, most likely they are already regaining their sight
at this very moment, our man with the black eyepatch is in for a shock,
Why, Because of the cataract, after all the time since I last examined
him it must have deteriorated, Is he going to stay blind, No, when life
gets back to normal, and everything is working again, I shall operate,
it is a matter of weeks, Why did we become blind, I don’t know, perhaps
one day we’ll find out, Do you want me to tell you what I think, Yes,
do, I don’t think we did go blind, I think we are blind, Blind but
seeing, Blind people who can see, but do not see.</p>
<p>The doctor’s wife got up and went to the window. She looked down at
the street full of refuse, at the shouting, singing people. Then she
lifted her head up to the sky and saw everything white, It is my turn,
she thought. Fear made her quickly lower her eyes. The city was still
there.</p>
