<h4 id="section">5</h4>
<p>I must open my eyes, thought the doctor’s wife. Through closed
eyelids, when she woke up at various times during the night, she had
perceived the dim light of the lamps that barely illuminated the ward,
but now she seemed to notice a difference, another luminous presence, it
could be the effect of the first glimmer of dawn, it could be that milky
sea already drowning her eyes. She told herself that she would count up
to ten and then open her eyelids, she said it twice, counted twice,
failed to open them twice. She could hear her husband breathing deeply
in the next bed and someone snoring, I wonder how the wound on that
fellow’s leg is doing, she asked herself, but knew at that moment that
she felt no real compassion, what she wanted was to pretend that she was
worried about something else, what she wanted was not to have to open
her eyes. She opened them the following instant, just like that, not
because of any conscious decision. Through the windows that began
halfway up the wall and ended up a mere hand’s-breadth from the ceiling,
entered the dull, bluish light of dawn. I’m not blind, she murmured, and
suddenly panicking, she raised herself on the bed, the girl with dark
glasses, who was occupying a bed opposite, might have heard her. She was
asleep. On the next bed, the one up against the wall, the boy was also
sleeping, She did the same as me, the doctor’s wife thought, she gave
him the safest place, what fragile walls we’d make, a mere stone in the
middle of the road without any hope other than to see the enemy trip
over it, enemy, what enemy, no one will attack us here, even if we’d
stolen and killed outside, no one is likely to come here to arrest us,
that man who stole the car has never been so sure of his freedom, we’re
so remote from the world that any day now, we shall no longer know who
we are, or even remember our names, and besides, what use would names be
to us, no dog recognises another dog or knows the others by the names
they have been given, a dog is identified by its scent and that is how
it identifies others, here we are like another breed of dogs, we know
each other’s bark or speech, as for the rest, features, colour of eyes
or hair, they are of no importance, it is as if they did not exist, I
can still see but for how long, The light changed a little, it could not
be night coming back, it had to be the sky clouding over, delaying the
morning. A groan came from the thief’s bed, If the wound has become
infected, thought the doctor’s wife, we have nothing to treat it with,
no remedy, in these conditions the tiniest accident can become a
tragedy, perhaps that is what they are waiting for, that we perish here,
one after the other, when the beast dies, the poison dies with it. The
doctor’s wife rose from her bed, leaned over her husband, was about to
wake him, but did not have the courage to drag him from his sleep and
know that he continued to be blind. Barefoot, one step at a time, she
went to the thief’s bed. His eyes were open and unmoving. How are you
feeling, whispered the doctor’s wife. The thief turned his head in the
direction of the voice and said, Bad, my leg is very painful, she was
about to say to him, Let me see, but held back just in time, such
imprudence, it was he who did not remember that there were only blind
people there, he acted without thinking, as he would have done several
hours ago, there outside, if a doctor had said to him, Let’s have a look
at this wound, and he raised the blanket. Even in the half-light, anyone
capable of seeing would have noticed the mattress soaked in blood, the
black hole of the wound with its swollen edges. The bandage had come
undone. The doctor’s wife carefully lowered the blanket, then with a
rapid, delicate gesture, passed her hand over the man’s forehead. His
skin felt dry and burning hot. The light changed again, the clouds were
drifting away. The doctor’s wife returned to her bed, but this time did
not lie down. She was watching her husband who was murmuring in his
sleep, the shadowy forms of the others beneath the grey blankets, the
grimy walls, the empty beds waiting to be occupied, and she serenely
wished that she, too, could turn blind, penetrate the visible skin of
things and pass to their inner side, to their dazzling and irremediable
blindness.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from outside the ward, probably from the hallway separating
the two wings of the building, came the sound of angry voices, Out, out,
Get out, away with you, You cannot stay here, Orders have to be obeyed.
The din got louder, then quietened down, a door slammed shut, all that
could be heard now was a distressed sobbing, the unmistakable clatter
made by someone who had just fallen over. In the ward they were all
awake. They turned their heads towards the entrance, they did not need
to be able to see to know that these were blind people who were
arriving. The doctor’s wife got up, how she would have liked to help the
new arrivals, to say a kind word, to guide them to their beds, inform
them, Take note, this is bed seven on the left-hand side, this is number
four on the right, you can’t go wrong, yes, there are six of us here, we
came yesterday, yes, we were the first, our names, what do names matter,
I believe one of the men has stolen a car, then there is the man who was
robbed, there’s a mysterious girl with dark glasses who puts drops in
for her conjunctivitis, how do I know, being blind, that she wears dark
glasses, well as it happens, my husband is an ophthalmologist and she
went to consult him at his surgery, yes, he’s also here, blindness
struck all of us, ah, of course, there’s also the boy with the squint.
She did not move, she simply said to her husband, They’re arriving. The
doctor got out of bed, his wife helped him into his trousers, it didn’t
matter, no one could see, just then the blind internees came into the
ward, there were five of them, three men and two women. The doctor said,
raising his voice, Keep calm, no need to rush, there are six of us here,
how many are you, there’s room for everyone. They did not know how many
they were, true they had come into contact with each other, sometimes
even bumped into each other, as they were pushed from the wing on the
left to this one, but they did not know how many they were. And they
were carrying no luggage. When they woke up in their ward and found they
were blind and started bemoaning their fate, the others put them out
without a moment’s hesitation, without even giving them time to take
their leave of any relatives or friends who might be with them. The
doctor’s wife remarked, It would be best if they could be counted and
each person gave their name. Motionless, the blind internees hesitated,
but someone had to make a start, two of the men spoke at once, it always
happens, both then fell silent, and it was the third man who began,
Number one, he paused, it seemed he was about to give his name, but what
he said was, I’m a policeman, and the doctor’s wife thought to herself,
He didn’t give his name, he too knows that names are of no importance
here. Another man was introducing himself, Number two, and he followed
the example of the first man, I’m a taxi-driver. The third man said,
Number three, I’m a pharmacist’s assistant. Then a woman spoke up,
Number four, I’m a hotel maid, and the last one of all, Number five, I
work in an office. That’s my wife, my wife, where are you, tell me where
you are, Here, I’m here, she said bursting into tears and walking
unsteadily along the aisle with her eyes wide open, her hands struggling
against the milky sea flooding into them. More confident, he advanced
towards her, Where are you, where are you, he was now murmuring as if in
prayer. One hand found another, the next moment they were embracing, a
single body, kisses in search of kisses, at times lost in mid-air for
they could not see each other’s cheeks, eyes, lips. Sobbing, the
doctor’s wife clung to her husband, as if she, too, had just been
reunited, but what she was saying was, This is terrible, a real
disaster. Then the voice of the boy with the squint could be heard
asking, Is my mummy here as well. Seated on his bed, the girl with dark
glasses murmured, She’ll come, don’t worry, she’ll come.</p>
<p>Here, each person’s real home is the place where they sleep,
therefore little wonder that the first concern of the new arrivals
should be to choose a bed, just as they had done in the other ward, when
they still had eyes to see. In the case of the wife of the first blind
man there could be no doubt, her rightful and natural place was beside
her husband, in bed seventeen, leaving number eighteen in the middle,
like an empty space separating her from the girl with dark glasses. Nor
is it surprising that they should try as far as possible to stay close
together, there are many affinities here, some already known, others
that are about to be revealed, for example, it was the pharmacist’s
assistant who sold eye-drops to the girl with dark glasses, this was the
taxi-driver who took the first blind man to the doctor, this fellow who
has identified himself as being a policeman found the blind thief
weeping like a lost child, and as for the hotel maid, she was the first
person to enter the room when the girl with dark glasses had a screaming
fit. It is nevertheless certain that not all of these affinities will
become explicit and known, either because of a lack of opportunity, or
because no one so much as imagined that they could possibly exist, or
because of a simple question of sensibility and tact. The hotel maid
would never dream that the woman she saw naked is here, we know that the
pharmacist’s assistant served other customers wearing dark glasses who
came to purchase eye-drops, no one would be imprudent enough to denounce
to the policeman the presence of someone who stole a car, the
taxi-driver would swear that during the last few days he had no blind
man as a passenger. Naturally, the first blind man told his wife in a
low voice that one of the internees is the scoundrel who went off with
their car, What a coincidence, eh, but, since in the meantime, he knew
that the poor devil was badly injured in one leg, he was generous enough
to add, He’s been punished enough. And she, because of her deep distress
at being blind and her great joy on regaining her husband, joy and
sorrow can go together, not like oil and water, she no longer remembered
what she had said two days before, that she would give a year of her
life if this rogue, her word, were to go blind. And if there was some
last shadow of resentment still troubling her spirit, it certainly blew
over when the wounded man moaned pitifully, Doctor, please help me.
Allowing himself to be guided by his wife, the doctor gently probed the
edges of his wound, he could do nothing more, nor was there any point in
trying to bathe it, the infection might have been caused by the deep
penetration of a shoe heel that had been in contact with the surface of
the streets and the floors here in the building, or equally by
pathogenic agents in all probability to be found in the contaminated
almost stagnant water, coming from antiquated pipes in appalling
condition. The girl with dark glasses who had got up on hearing his
moan, began approaching slowly, counting the beds. She leaned forward,
stretched out her hand, which brushed against the face of the doctor’s
wife, and then, having reached, who knows how, the wounded man’s hand,
which was burning hot, she said sadly, Please, forgive me, it was
entirely my fault, there was no need for me to do what I did, Forget it,
replied the man, these things happen in life, I shouldn’t have done what
I did either.</p>
<p>Almost covering these last words, the harsh voice from the
loudspeaker came booming out, Attention, attention, your food has been
left at the entrance as well as supplies for your hygiene and
cleanliness, the blind should go first to collect their food, those in
the wing for the contaminated will be informed when it’s their turn,
attention, attention, your food has been left at the entrance, the blind
should make their way there first, the blind first. Dazed by fever, the
wounded man did not grasp all the words, he thought they were being told
to leave, that their detention was over, and he made as if to get up,
but the doctor’s wife held him back, Where are you going, Didn’t you
hear, he asked, they said the blind should leave, Yes, but only to go
and collect our food. The wounded man gave a despondent sigh, and once
more could feel the pain piercing through his flesh. The doctor said,
Stay here, I’ll go, I’m coming with you, said his wife. Just as they
were about to leave the ward, a man who had come from the other wing,
inquired, Who is this fellow, the reply came from the first blind man,
He’s a doctor, an eye-specialist, That’s a good one, said the
taxi-driver, just our luck to end up with the one doctor who can do
nothing for us, We’re also landed with a taxi-driver who can’t take us
anywhere, replied the girl with dark glasses sarcastically.</p>
<p>The container with the food was in the hallway. The doctor asked his
wife, Guide me to the main door, Why, I’m going to tell them that there
is someone here with a serious infection and that we have no medicines,
Remember the warning, Yes, but perhaps when confronted with a concrete
case, I doubt it, Me, too, but we ought to try. At the top of the steps
leading to the forecourt, the daylight dazzled his wife, and not because
it was too intense, there were dark clouds passing across the sky, and
it looked as if it might rain, In such a short time I’ve become unused
to bright light, she thought. Just at that moment, a soldier shouted
from the gate, Stop, turn back, I have orders to shoot, and then, in the
same tone of voice, pointing his gun, Sergeant, there are some people
here trying to leave, We have no wish to leave, the doctor protested, In
my opinion that is not what they want, said the sergeant as he
approached, and, looking through the bars of the main gate, he asked,
What’s going on, A person who has injured his leg has an infected wound,
we urgently need antibiotics and other medicines, My orders are
crystal-clear, no one is to be allowed to leave, and the only thing we
can allow in is food, If the infection should get worse which looks all
too certain, it could soon prove fatal, That isn’t my affair, Then
contact your superiors, Look here, blind man, let me tell you something,
either the two of you get back to where you came from, or you’ll be
shot, Let’s go, said the wife, there’s nothing to be done, they’re not
to blame, they’re terrified and are only obeying orders, I can’t believe
that this is happening, it’s against all the rules of humanity, You’d
better believe it, because the truth couldn’t be clearer, Are you two
still there, I’m going to count up to three and if they’re not out of my
sight by then, they can be sure they won’t get back, ooone, twooo,
threee, that’s it, he was as good as his word, and turning to the
soldiers, Even if it were my own brother, he did not explain to whom he
was referring, whether it was to the man who had come to request
medicines or to the other fellow with the infected leg. Inside, the
wounded man wanted to know if they were going to supply them with
medicines, How do you know I went to ask for supplies, asked the doctor,
I guessed as much, after all, you are a doctor, I’m very sorry, Does
that mean there will be no medicines, Yes, So, that’s that.</p>
<p>The food had been carefully calculated for five people. There were
bottles of milk and biscuits, but whoever had prepared their rations had
forgotten to provide any glasses, nor were there any plates, or cutlery,
these would probably come with the lunch. The doctor’s wife went to give
the wounded man something to drink, but he vomited. The taxi-driver
complained that he did not like milk, he asked if he could have coffee.
Some, after having eaten, went back to bed, the first blind man took his
wife to visit the various places, they were the only two to leave the
ward. The pharmacist’s assistant asked to be allowed to speak to the
doctor, he wanted the doctor to tell him if he had formed any opinion
about their illness, I don’t believe this can strictly be called an
illness, the doctor started to explain, and then with much
simplification, he summed up what he had researched in his reference
books before becoming blind. Several beds further on, the taxi-driver
was listening attentively, and when the doctor had finished his report,
he shouted down the ward, I’ll bet what happened is that the channels
that go from the eyes to the brain got congested, Stupid fool, growled
the pharmacist’s assistant with indignation, Who knows, the doctor could
not resist a smile, in truth the eyes are nothing more than lenses, it
is the brain that actually does the seeing, just as an image appears on
the film, and if the channels did get blocked up, as that man suggested,
it’s the same as a carburetor, if the fuel can’t reach it, the engine
does not work and the car won’t go, as simple as that, as you can see,
the doctor told the pharmacist’s assistant, And how much longer, doctor,
do you think we’re going to be kept here, asked the hotel maid, At least
for as long as we are unable to see, And how long will that be, Frankly,
I don’t think anyone knows, it’s either something that will pass or it
might go on for ever, How I’d love to know. The maid sighed and after
several moments, I’d also like to know what happened to that girl, What
girl, asked the pharmacist’s assistant, That girl from the hotel, what a
shock she gave me, there in the middle of the room, as naked as the day
she was born, wearing nothing but a pair of dark glasses, and screaming
that she was blind, she’s probably the one who infected me. The doctor’s
wife looked, saw the girl slowly remove her dark glasses, hiding her
movements, then put them under her pillow, while asking the boy with the
squint, Would you like another biscuit, For the first time since she had
arrived there, the doctor’s wife felt as if she were behind a microscope
and observing the behaviour of a number of human beings who did not even
suspect her presence, and this suddenly struck her as being contemptible
and obscene. I have no right to look if the others cannot see me, she
thought to herself. With a shaky hand, the girl applied a few eye-drops.
This would always allow her to say that these were not tears running
from her eyes.</p>
<p>Hours later, when the loudspeaker announced that they should come and
collect their lunch, the first blind man and the taxi-driver offered to
go on this mission for which eyes were not essential, it was enough to
be able to touch. The containers were some distance from the door that
connected the hallway to the corridors, to find them they had to go down
on all fours, sweeping the floor ahead with one arm outstretched, while
the other served as a third paw, and if they had no difficulty in
returning to the ward, it was because the doctor’s wife had come up with
the idea, which she was at pains to justify from personal experience, of
tearing a blanket into strips, and using these to make an improvised
rope, one end of which would remain attached to the outside handle of
the door of the ward, while the other end would be tied in turn to the
ankle of whoever had to go to fetch their food. The two men went off,
the plates and cutlery arrived, but the portions were still only for
five, in all likelihood the sergeant in charge of the patrol was unaware
that there were six more blind people there, since once outside the
entrance, even when paying attention to what might be happening behind
the main door, in the shadows of the hallway, it was only by chance that
anyone could be seen passing from one wing to another. The taxi-driver
offered to go and demand the missing portions of food, and he went
alone, he had no wish to be accompanied, We’re not five, there are
eleven of us, he shouted at the soldiers, and the same sergeant replied
from the other side, Save your breath, there are many more to come yet,
he said it in a tone of voice that must have seemed derisive to the
taxi-driver, if we take into account the words spoken by the latter when
he returned to the ward, It was as if he were making fun of me. They
shared out the food, five portions divided by ten, since the wounded man
was still refusing to eat, all he asked for was some water, and he
begged them to moisten his lips. His skin was burning hot. And since he
could not bear the contact and weight of the blanket on the wound for
very long, he uncovered his leg from time to time, but the cold air in
the ward soon obliged him to cover up again, and this went on for hours.
He would moan at regular intervals with what sounded like a stifled
gasp, as if the constant and persistent pain had suddenly got worse
before he could get it under control.</p>
<p>In the middle of the afternoon, three more blind people arrived,
expelled from the other wing. One was an employee from the surgery, whom
the doctor’s wife recognised at once, and the others, as destiny had
decreed, were the man who had been with the girl with dark glasses in
the hotel and the ill-mannered policeman who had taken her home. No
sooner had they reached their beds and seated themselves, than the
employee from the surgery began weeping in despair, the two men said
nothing, as if still unable to grasp what had happened to them.
Suddenly, from the street, came the cries of people shouting, orders
being given in a booming voice, a rebellious uproar. The blind internees
all turned their heads in the direction of the door and waited. They
could not see, but knew what was about to happen within the next few
minutes. The doctor’s wife, seated on the bed beside her husband, said
in a low voice, It had to be, the promised hell is about to begin. He
squeezed her hand and murmured, Don’t move, from now on there is nothing
you can do. The shouting had died down, now a confusion of sounds was
coming from the hallway, these were the blind, driven like sheep,
bumping into each other, crammed together in the doorways, some lost
their sense of direction and ended up in other wards, but the majority,
stumbling along, huddled into groups or dispersed one by one,
desperately waving their hands in the air like people drowning, burst
into the ward in a whirlwind, as if being pushed from the outside by a
bulldozer. A number of them fell and were trampled underfoot. Confined
in the narrow aisles, the new arrivals gradually began filling the
spaces between the beds, and here, like a ship caught in a storm that
has finally managed to reach port, they took possession of their berths,
in this case their beds, insisting that there was no room for anyone
else, and that latecomers should find themselves a place elsewhere. From
the far end, the doctor shouted that there were other wards, but the few
who remained without a bed were frightened of getting lost in the
labyrinth of rooms, corridors, closed doors, stairways they might only
discover at the last minute. Finally they realised they could not stay
there and, struggling to find the door by which they had entered, they
ventured forth into the unknown. As if searching for one last safe
refuge, the five blind internees in the second group had managed to
occupy the beds, which, between them and those in the first group, had
remained empty. Only the wounded man remained isolated, without
protection, on bed fourteen on the left-hand side.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, apart from some weeping and wailing, the
discreet sounds of people settling down, calm rather than peace of mind
was restored in the ward. All the beds were now occupied. The evening
was drawing in, the dim lamps seemed to gain strength. Then they heard
the abrupt voice of the loudspeaker. As on the first day, instructions
were repeated as to how the wards should be maintained and the rules the
internees should obey, The Government regrets having to enforce to the
letter what it considers its right and duty, to protect the population
with all the means at its disposal during this present crisis, etc.,
etc. When the voice stopped, an indignant chorus of protests broke out,
We’re locked up here, We’re all going to die in here, This isn’t right,
Where are the doctors we were promised, this was something new, the
authorities had promised doctors, medical assistance, perhaps even a
complete cure. The doctor did not say that if they were in need of a
doctor he was there at their disposal. He would never say that again.
His hands alone are not enough for a doctor, a doctor cures with
medicines, drugs, chemical compounds and combinations of this and that,
and here there is no trace of any such materials, nor any hope of
getting them. He did not even have the sight of his eyes to notice any
sickly pallor, to observe any reddening of the peripheric circulation,
how often, without any need for closer examination, these external signs
proved to be as useful as an entire clinical history, or the colouring
of mucus and pigmentation, with every probability of coming up with the
right diagnosis, You won’t escape this one. Since the nearby beds were
all occupied, his wife could no longer keep him informed of what was
happening, but he sensed the tense, uneasy atmosphere, bordering on open
conflict, that had been created with the arrival of the latest group of
internees. The very air in the ward seemed to have become heavier,
emitting strong lingering odours, with sudden wafts that were simply
nauseating, What will this place be like within a week, he asked
himself, and it horrified him to think that in a week’s time, they would
still be confined here, Assuming there won’t be any problems with food
supplies, and who can be sure there isn’t already a shortage, I doubt,
for example, whether those outside have any idea from one minute to the
next, how many of us are interned here, the question is how they will
solve the matter of hygiene, I’m not referring to how we shall keep
ourselves clean, struck blind only a few days ago and without anyone to
help us, or whether the showers will work and for how long, I’m
referring to the rest, to all the other likely problems, for if the
lavatories should get blocked, even one of them, this place would be
transformed into a sewer. He rubbed his face with his hands, he could
feel the roughness of his beard after three days without shaving, It’s
preferable like this, I hope they won’t have the unfortunate idea of
sending us razor blades and scissors. He had everything necessary for
shaving in his suitcase, but was conscious of the fact that it would be
a mistake to try, And where, where, not here in the ward, among all
these people, true my wife could shave me, but it would not be long
before the others got wind of it and expressed surprise that there
should be someone here capable of offering these services, and there
inside, in the showers, such confusion, dear God, how we miss having our
sight, to be able to see, to see, even if they were only faint shadows,
to stand before the mirror, see a dark diffused patch and be able to
say, That’s my face, anything that has light does not belong to me.</p>
<p>The complaints subsided little by little, someone from one of the
other wards came to ask if there was any food left over and the
taxi-driver was quick to reply, Not a crumb, and the pharmacist’s
assistant to show some good will, mitigated the peremptory refusal,
There might be more to come. But nothing would come. Darkness fell. From
outside came neither food nor words. Cries could be heard coming from
the adjoining ward, then there was silence, if anyone was weeping they
did so very quietly, the weeping did not penetrate the walls. The
doctor’s wife went to see how the injured man was faring, It’s me, she
said, carefully raising the blanket. His leg presented a terrifying
sight, completely swollen from the thigh down, and the wound, a black
circle with bloody purplish blotches, had got much larger, as if the
flesh had been stretched from inside. It gave off a stench that was both
fetid and slightly sweet. How are you feeling, the doctor’s wife asked
him, Thanks for coming, Tell me how you’re feeling, Bad, Are you in
pain, Yes and no, What do you mean, It hurts, but it’s as if the leg
were no longer mine, as if it were separated from my body, I can’t
explain, it’s a strange feeling, as if I were lying here watching my leg
hurt me, That’s because you’re feverish, Probably, Now try to get some
sleep. The doctor’s wife placed her hand on his forehead, then made to
withdraw, but before she could even wish him good-night, the invalid
grabbed her by the arm and drew her towards him obliging her to get
close to his face, I know you can see, he said in a low voice. The
doctor’s wife trembled with surprise and murmured, You’re wrong,
whatever put such an idea into your head, I see as much as anybody here,
Don’t try to deceive me, I know very well that you can see, but don’t
worry, I won’t breathe a word to anyone, Sleep, sleep, Don’t you trust
me, Of course, I do, Don’t you trust the word of a thief, I said I
trusted you. Then why don’t you tell me the truth, We’ll talk tomorrow,
now go to sleep, Yes, tomorrow, if I get that far, We mustn’t think the
worst, I do, or perhaps it’s the fever thinking for me. The doctor’s
wife rejoined her husband and whispered in his ear, the wound looks
awful, could it be gangrene, It seems unlikely in such a short time,
Whatever it is, he’s in a bad way, And those of us who are cooped up
here, said the doctor in a deliberately loud voice, as if being struck
blind were not enough, we might just as well have our hands and feet
tied. From bed fourteen, left-hand side, the invalid replied, No one is
going to tie me up, doctor.</p>
<p>The hours passed, one by one, the blind internees had fallen asleep.
Some had covered their heads with a blanket, as if anxious that a
pitch-black darkness, a real one, might extinguish once and for all the
dim suns that their eyes had become. The three lamps suspended from the
high ceiling, out of arm’s reach, cast a dull, yellowish light over the
beds, a light incapable of even creating shadows. Forty persons were
sleeping or desperately trying to get to sleep, some were sighing and
murmuring in their dreams, perhaps in their dream they could see what
they were dreaming, perhaps they were saying to themselves, If this is a
dream, I don’t want to wake up. All their watches had stopped, either
they had forgotten to wind them or had decided it was pointless, only
that of the doctor’s wife was still working. It was after three in the
morning. Further along, very slowly, resting on his elbows, the thief
raised his body into a sitting position. He had no feeling in his leg,
nothing except the pain, the rest had ceased to belong to him. His knee
was quite stiff. He rolled his body over on to the side of his healthy
leg, which he allowed to hang out of the bed, then with both hands under
his thigh, he tried to move his injured leg in the same direction. Like
a pack of wolves suddenly roused, the pain went through his entire body,
before returning to the dark crater from which it came. Resting on his
hands, he gradually dragged his body across the mattress in the
direction of the aisle. When he reached the rail at the foot of the bed,
he had to rest. He was gasping for breath as if he were suffering from
asthma, his head swayed on his shoulders, he could barely keep it
upright. After several minutes, his breathing became more regular and he
got slowly to his feet, putting his weight on his good leg. He knew that
the other one would be no good to him, that he would have to drag it
behind him wherever he went. He suddenly felt dizzy, an irrepressible
shiver went through his body, the cold and fever made his teeth chatter.
Supporting himself on the metal frames of the beds, passing from one to
the other as if along a chain, he slowly advanced between the sleeping
bodies. He dragged his injured leg like a bag. No one noticed him, no
one asked, Where are you going at this hour, had anyone done so, he knew
what he would reply, I’m off for a pee, he would say, he didn’t want the
doctor’s wife to call out to him, she was someone he could not deceive
or lie to, he would have to tell her what was on his mind, I can’t go on
rotting away in this hole, I realise that your husband has done
everything he could to help me, but when I had to steal a car I wouldn’t
go and ask someone else to steal it for me, this is much the same, I’m
the one who has to go, when they see me in this state they’ll recognise
at once that I’m in a bad way, put me in an ambulance and take me to a
hospital, there must be hospitals just for the blind, one more won’t
make any difference, they’ll treat my wound, cure me, I’ve heard that’s
what they do to those condemned to death, if they’ve got appendicitis
they operate first and execute them afterwards, so that they die
healthy, as far as I’m concerned, if they want, they can bring me back
here, I don’t mind. He advanced further, clenching his teeth to suppress
any moaning, but he could not resist an anguished sob when, on reaching
the end of the row, he lost his balance. He had miscounted the beds, he
thought there was one more and came up against a void. Lying on the
floor, he did not stir until he was certain that no one had woken up
with the din made by his fall. Then he realised that this position was
perfect for a blind person, if he were to advance on all fours he would
find the way more easily. He dragged himself along until he reached the
hallway, there he paused to consider how he should proceed, whether it
would be better to call from the door or go up to the gate, taking
advantage of the rope that had served as a handrail and almost certainly
was still there. He knew full well that if he were to call for help from
there, they would immediately order him to go back, but the alternative
of having only a swaying rope as his support, after what he had
suffered, notwithstanding the solid support of the beds, made him
somewhat hesitant. After some minutes, he thought he had found the
solution. I’ll go on all fours, he thought, keeping under the rope, and
from time to time I’ll raise my hand to see whether I’m on the right
track, this is just like stealing a car, ways and means can always be
found. Suddenly, taking him by surprise, his conscience awoke and
censured him bitterly for having allowed himself to steal a car from an
unfortunate blind man. The fact that I’m in this situation now, he
reasoned, isn’t because I stole his car, it’s because I accompanied him
home, that was my big mistake. His conscience was in no mood for
casuistic discussions, his reasons were simple and clear, A blind man is
sacred, you don’t steal from a blind man. Technically speaking, I didn’t
rob him, he wasn’t carrying the car in his pocket, nor did I hold a gun
to his head, the accused protested in his defence, Forget the sophisms,
muttered his conscience, and get on your way.</p>
<p>The cold dawn air cooled his face. How well one breathes out here, he
thought to himself. He had the impression that his leg was much less
painful, but this did not surprise him, sometime before, and more than
once, the same thing had happened. He was now outside the main door, he
would soon be at the steps, That’s going to be the most awkward bit, he
thought, going down the steps head first. He raised one arm to check
that the rope was there, and continued on. Just as he had foreseen, it
was not easy to get from one step to the next, especially because of his
leg which was no help to him, and the proof was not long in coming,
when, in the middle of the steps, one of his hands having slipped, his
body lurched to one side and was dragged along by the dead weight of his
wretched leg. The pain came back instantly, as if someone were sawing,
drilling, and hammering the wound, and even he was at a loss to explain
how he prevented himself from crying out. For several long minutes, he
remained prostrate, face down on the ground. A rapid gust of wind at
ground level, left him shivering. He was wearing nothing but a shirt and
his underpants. The wound was pressed against the ground, and he
thought, It might get infected, a foolish thought, he was forgetting
that he had been dragging his leg along the ground all the way from the
ward, Well, it doesn’t matter, they’ll treat it before it turns
infectious, he thought afterwards, to put his mind at rest, and he
turned sideways to reach the rope more easily. He did not find it right
away. He forgot that he had ended up in a vertical position in relation
to the rope when he had rolled down the steps, but instinct told him
that he should stay put. Then his reasoning guided him as he moved into
a sitting position and then slowly back until his haunches made contact
with the first step, and with a triumphant sense of victory he clutched
the rough cord in his raised hand. Probably it was this same feeling
that led him to discover almost immediately, a way of moving without his
wound rubbing on the ground, by turning his back towards the main gate
and sitting up and using his arms like crutches, as cripples used to do,
he eased his seated body along in tiny stages. Backwards, yes, because
in this case as in others, pulling was much easier than pushing. In this
way, his leg suffered less, besides which the gentle slope of the
forecourt going down towards the gate was a great help. As for the rope,
he was in no danger of losing it, he was almost touching it with his
head. He wondered whether he would have much further to go before
reaching the main gate, getting there on foot, better still on two feet
was not the same as advancing backwards half a hand’s-breadth inch by
inch. Forgetting for an instant that he was blind, he turned his head as
if to confirm how far he still had to go and found himself confronted by
the same impenetrable whiteness. Could it be night, could it be day, he
asked himself, well if it were day they would already have spotted me,
besides, they had only delivered breakfast and that was many hours ago.
He was surprised to discover the speed and accuracy of his reasoning and
how logical he could be, he saw himself in a different light, a new man,
and were it not for this damn leg he would swear he had never felt so
well in his entire life. His lower back came up against the metal plate
at the bottom of the main gate. He had arrived. Huddled inside the
sentry box to protect himself from the cold, the guard on duty thought
he had heard faint noises he could not identify, in any case he did not
think they could have come from inside, it must have been a sudden
rustling of the trees, a branch the wind had caused to brush against the
railings. These were followed by another noise, but this time it was
different, a bang, the sound of crashing to be more precise, which could
not have been caused by the wind. Nervously the guard came out of his
sentry box, his finger on the trigger of his automatic rifle, and looked
towards the main gate. He could not see anything. The noise, however,
was back, louder, as if someone were scratching their fingernails on a
rough surface. The metal plate on the gate, he thought to himself. He
was about to head for the field tent where the sergeant was sleeping,
but held back at the thought that if he raised a false alarm he would be
given an earful, sergeants do not like being disturbed when they are
sleeping, even when there is some good reason. He looked back at the
main gate and waited in a state of tension. Very slowly, between two
vertical iron bars, like a ghost, a white face began to appear. The face
of a blind man. Fear made the soldier’s blood freeze, and fear drove him
to aim his weapon and release a blast of gunfire at close range.</p>
<p>The noise of the blast immediately brought the soldiers, half
dressed, from their tents. These were the soldiers from the detachment
entrusted with guarding the mental asylum and its inmates. The sergeant
was already on the scene, What the hell is going on, A blind man, a
blind man, stuttered the soldier, Where, He was there and he pointed at
the main gate with the butt of his weapon, I can see nothing there, He
was there, I saw him. The soldiers had finished getting into their gear
and were waiting in line, their rifles at the ready. Switch on the
floodlight, the sergeant ordered. One of the soldiers got up on to the
platform of the vehicle. Seconds later the blinding rays lit up the main
gate and the front of the building. There’s no one there, you fool, said
the sergeant, and he was just about to deliver a few more choice insults
in the same vein when he saw spreading out from under the gate, in that
dazzling glare, a black puddle. You’ve finished him off, he said. Then,
remembering the strict orders they had been given, he yelled, Get back,
this is infectious. The soldiers drew back, terrified, but continued to
watch the pool of blood that was slowly spreading in the gaps between
the small cobblestones in the path. Do you think the man’s dead, asked
the sergeant, He must be, the shot struck him right in the face, replied
the soldier, now pleased with the obvious demonstration of the accuracy
of his aim. At that moment, another soldier shouted nervously, Sergeant,
sergeant, look over there. Standing at the top of the steps, lit up by
the white light coming from the searchlight, a number of blind internees
could be seen, more than ten of them, Stay where you are, bellowed the
sergeant, if you take another step, I’ll blast the lot of you. At the
windows of the buildings opposite, several people, woken up by the noise
of gunshots, were looking out in terror. Then the sergeant shouted, Four
of you come and fetch the body. Because they could neither see nor
count, six blind men came forward. I said four, the sergeant bawled
hysterically. The blind internees touched each other, then touched
again, and two of them stayed behind. Holding on to the rope, the others
began moving forward.</p>
