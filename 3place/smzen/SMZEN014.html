<h4 id="section">13</h4>
<p>Say to a blind man, you’re free, open the door that was separating
him from the world, Go, you are free, we tell him once more, and he does
not go, he has remained motionless there in the middle of the road, he
and the others, they are terrified, they do not know where to go, the
fact is that there is no comparison between living in a rational
labyrinth, which is, by definition, a mental asylum and venturing forth,
without a guiding hand or a dog-leash, into the demented labyrinth of
the city, where memory will serve no purpose, for it will merely be able
to recall the images of places but not the paths whereby we might get
there. Standing in front of the building which is already ablaze from
end to end, the blind inmates can feel the living waves of heat from the
fire on their faces, they receive them as something which in a way
protects them, just as the walls did before, prison and refuge at once.
They stay together, pressed up against each other, like a flock, no one
there wants to be the lost sheep, for they know that no shepherd will
come looking for them. The fire gradually begins to die down, the moon
casts its light once more, the blind inmates begin to feel uneasy, they
cannot remain there, For all eternity, as one of them said. Someone
asked if it was day or night, the reason for this incongruous curiosity
soon became apparent, Who knows, they might bring us some food, perhaps
there has been some confusion, some delay, it has happened before, But
the soldiers are no longer here. That doesn’t mean a thing, they might
have gone away because they’re no longer needed, I don’t understand, For
example, because there is no longer any danger of infection, Or because
a cure has been found for our illness, That would be good, it really
would, What are we going to do, I’m staying here until daybreak, And how
will you know it is daybreak, By the sun, by the heat of the sun, And
what if the sky is overcast, There is only a limited number of hours and
then it must be day at some point. Exhausted, many of the blind had sat
down on the ground, others, weaker still, simply collapsed into a heap,
some had fainted, it is possible that the cool night air will restore
consciousness, but we can be certain that when it is time to break camp,
some of these unfortunates will not get up, they have resisted until
now, they are like that marathon runner who dropped dead three metres
from the finish line, when all is said and done, what is clear is that
all lives end before their time. Also seated or stretched out on the
ground were those blind inmates who are still awaiting the soldiers, or
others instead of them, the Red Cross is one hypothesis, they might
bring them food and the other basic comforts, for these people
disenchantment will come a little later, that is the only difference.
And if anyone here believed that a cure had been discovered for our
blindness, this does not appear to have made him any more contented.</p>
<p>For other reasons, the doctor’s wife thought that it would be better
to wait until night was over, as she told her group, The most urgent
thing right now is to find some food and in the dark this would not be
easy. Have you any idea where we are, her husband asked, More or less,
Far from home, Quite a distance. The others also wanted to know how far
they were from their homes, they told her their addresses, and the
doctor’s wife did her best to explain, the boy with the squint cannot
remember, and little wonder, he has not asked for his mother for quite
some time. If they were to go from house to house, from the one that is
closest to the one furthest away, the first house will be that of the
girl with dark glasses, the second one that of the old man with the
black eyepatch, then that of the doctor’s wife, and finally the house of
the first blind man. They will undoubtedly follow this itinerary because
the girl with dark glasses has already asked that she should be taken to
her home as soon as possible, I can’t imagine what state my parents will
be in, she said, this sincere preoccupation shows how groundless are the
preconceived ideas of those who deny the possibility of the existence of
deep feelings, including filial ones, in the, alas, abundant cases of
irregular conduct, especially in matters of public morality. The night
turned cool, there is not much left for the fire to burn, the heat still
coming from the embers is not enough to warm the blind inmates, numb
with cold, who find themselves farthest away from the asylum gate, as is
the case of the doctor’s wife and her group. They are seated in a
huddle, the three women and the boy in the middle, the three men around
them, anyone seeing them there would say that they had been born like
that, it is true that they give the impression of being but one body,
one breath and one hunger. One after the other, they eventually fell
asleep, a light sleep from which they were roused several times because
blind inmates, emerging from their own torpor, got up and stumbled
drowsily over this human obstacle, one of them actually stayed behind,
there was no difference between sleeping there or in some other place.
When day dawned, only a few thin columns of smoke rose from the embers,
but not even these lasted for long, for it soon began to rain, a fine
drizzle, a mere mist, it is true, but nevertheless persistent, to begin
with it did not even touch the scorched earth, but transformed itself at
once into vapour, but, as it continued to fall, as everybody knows, a
soft water eats away hard stone, let someone else make it rhyme. It is
not only the eyes of some of these inmates that are blind, their
understanding is also clouded, for there can be no other explanation for
the tortuous reasoning that led them to conclude that the much desired
food would not arrive in this rain. There was no way of convincing them
that the premise was wrong and that, therefore, the conclusion, too, had
to be wrong, they simply would not be told that it was still too early
for breakfast, in despair, they threw themselves to the ground in floods
of tears. It won’t come, it’s raining, it won’t come, they repeated, if
that lamentable ruin were still fit for even the most primitive
habitation, it would go back to being the madhouse it once was.</p>
<p>The blind man who, after tripping, had stayed behind that night,
could not get to his feet. Curled up, as if anxious to protect the last
of the heat in his belly, he did not stir despite the rain, which had
started to get heavier. He’s dead, said the doctor’s wife, and the rest
of us had better get away from here while we still have some strength.
They struggled to their feet, tottering and dizzy, holding on to each
other, then they got into line, in front the woman with eyes that can
see, then those who though they have eyes cannot see, the girl with dark
glasses, the old man with the black eyepatch, the boy with the squint,
the wife of the first blind man, her husband, and the doctor last of
all. The route they have taken leads to the city centre, but this is not
the intention of the doctor’s wife, what she wants is to find a place as
soon as possible where she can leave those following behind in safety
and then go in search of food on her own. The streets are deserted,
either because it is still early, or because of the rain that is
becoming increasingly heavy. There is litter everywhere, some shops have
their doors open, but most of them are closed, with no sign of life
inside, nor any light. The doctor’s wife thought that it would be a good
idea to leave her companions in one of these shops, taking care to make
a men tal note of the name of the street and the number on the door just
in case she should lose them on the way back. She paused, said to the
girl with dark glasses, Wait for me here, don’t move, she went to peer
through the glass-panelled door of a pharmacy, thought she could see the
shadowy forms of people lying on the ground, she tapped on the glass,
one of the shadows stirred, she knocked again, other human forms slowly
began moving, one person got up turning his head in the direction where
the noise had come from, They are all blind, the doctor’s wife thought,
but she could not fathom how they came to be here, perhaps they were
members of the pharmacist’s family, but if this was the case, why were
they not in their own home, with greater comfort than a hard floor,
unless they were guarding the premises, against whom, and for what
purpose, this merchandise being what it is, can cure and kill equally
well. She moved away, a little further ahead she looked inside another
shop, saw more people lying down, women, men, children, some appeared to
be preparing to leave, one of them came right up to the door, put his
arm outside and said, It’s raining, Is it raining much, was the question
from inside, Yes, we’ll have to wait until it eases off, the man, it was
a man, was two paces from the doctor’s wife, he had not noticed her
presence, and was therefore startled when he heard her say, Good-day, he
had lost the habit of saying Good-day, not only because the days of the
blind, strictly speaking are never likely to be good, but also because
no one could be entirely sure whether it was afternoon or night, and if
now, in apparent contradiction to what has just been explained, these
people are waking up more or less at the same time as morning, that is
because some of them only went blind a few days ago and still have not
entirely lost their sense of the succession of days and nights, of sleep
and wakefulness. The man said, It’s raining, and then asked, Who are
you, I’m not from here, Are you out searching for food, Yes, we haven’t
eaten for four days, And how do you know it is four days, That’s what I
reckon, Are you alone, I’m with my husband and some companions, How many
of them are there, Seven altogether, If you’re thinking of staying here
with us, forget it, there are far too many of us already, We’re only
passing through, Where have you come from, We’ve been interned ever
since this epidemic of blindness began, Ah, yes, the quarantine, it
didn’t do any good, Why do you say that, They allowed you to leave,
There was a fire and, at that moment, we realised that the soldiers who
were guarding us had disappeared, And you left, Yes, Your soldiers must
have been amongst the last to go blind, everyone is blind, the whole
city, the entire country, if anyone can still see, they say nothing,
keep it to themselves, Why don’t you live in your own house, Because I
no longer know where it is, You don’t know where it is, And what about
you, do you know where your house is, Me, the doctor’s wife was about to
reply that that was precisely where she was heading with her husband and
companions, all they needed was a quick bite to eat to recover their
strength, but at that very moment she saw the situation quite clearly,
somebody who was blind and had left their home would only manage to find
it again by some miracle, it was not the same as before, when blind
people could always count on the assistance of some passerby, whether to
cross the street, or to get back on to the right path in the case of
having inadvertently strayed from the usual route, All I know is that it
is far from here, she said, But you’ll never be able to get there, No,
Now there you have it, it’s the same with me, it’s the same with
everyone, those of you who have been in quarantine have a lot to learn,
you don’t know how easy it is to find yourself without a home, I don’t
understand, Those who go around in groups as we do, as most people do,
when we have to look for food, we are obliged to go together, it’s the
only way of not losing each other, and since we all go, since no one
stays behind to guard the house, assuming that we ever manage to find it
again, the likelihood is that it will already be occupied by another
group also unable to find their house, we’re a kind of merry-go-round,
at the outset there was some conflict, but we soon became aware that we,
the blind, in a manner of speaking, have practically nothing we may call
our own, except for what we are wearing, The solution would be to live
in a shop selling food, at least so long as supplies lasted there would
be no need to go out, Anyone who did that, the least that might happen
to them would be never to have another moment’s peace, I say the least,
because I’ve heard of the case of some who tried, shut themselves away,
bolted the door, but what they could not do was get rid of the smell of
food, those who wanted to eat gathered outside, and since those inside
refused to open the doors, the shop was set alight, it was a blessed
remedy, I didn’t see it myself, others told me, in any case it was a
blessed remedy, and as far as I know no one else dared to do the same,
And do people no longer live in houses and flats, Yes, they do, but it
comes to the same thing, countless people must have passed through my
house, who knows if I’ll ever find it again, besides, in this situation,
it’s much more practical to sleep in the shops at ground level, in
warehouses, it saves us having to go up and down stairs, It’s stopped
raining, said the doctor’s wife, It’s stopped raining, repeated the man
to those inside. On hearing these words, those who were still stretched
out got to their feet, gathered up their belongings, haversacks,
hand-luggage, bags made out of cloth and plastic, as if they were
setting off on an expedition, and it was true, they were off in pursuit
of food, one by one they began emerging from the shop, the doctor’s wife
noticed that they were well wrapped up even if the colours of their
clothing scarcely harmonised, their trousers either so short that they
exposed their shins, or so long that the bottoms had to be turned up,
but the cold would not get to this lot, some of the men wore a raincoat
or an overcoat, two of the women wore long fur coats, not an umbrella to
be seen, probably because they are so awkward to carry, and the spokes
are always in danger of poking someone’s eye out. The group, some
fifteen people, moved off. Along the road, other groups appeared, as
well as people on their own, up against the walls men were satisfying
the urgent need felt each morning by their bladder, the women preferred
the privacy of abandoned cars. Softened by the rain, the excrement, here
and there, was spread all over the pavement.</p>
<p>The doctor’s wife went back to her group, huddled together out of
instinct under the awning of a cake-shop that gave off a smell of soured
cream and other rancid products. Let’s go, she said, I’ve found a
refuge, and she led them to the shop the others had just left. The stock
in the shop was intact, there was nothing amongst the merchandise that
could be eaten or worn, there were fridges, washing-machines for both
clothes and dishes, ordinary stoves as well as microwave ovens, food
mixers, juicers, vacuum cleaners, the thousand and one electro-domestic
inventions destined to make life easier. The atmosphere was charged with
unpleasant odours, making the invariable whiteness of the objects
absurd. Rest here, said the doctor’s wife, I’m going to look for some
food, I have no idea where I’ll find it, nearby, far away, I cannot say,
wait patiently, there are groups out there, if anyone tries to come in,
tell them the place is occupied, that ought to be enough to send them
away, that’s the custom now, I’m coming with you, said her husband, No,
it’s best I should go alone, we must find out how people are surviving
now, from what I’ve heard everyone must have gone blind, In that case,
quipped the old man with the black eyepatch, it’s just as if we were
still in the mental asylum, There’s no comparison, we can move about
freely, and there must be a solution to the food problem, we won’t die
of hunger, I must also try to get some clothes, we’re reduced to rags,
she herself was in the greatest need, practically naked from the waist
upwards. She kissed her husband, at that moment she felt something akin
to a pain in her heart. Please, whatever happens, even if someone should
try to come in, do not leave this place, and if you should be turned
out, although I don’t believe this will happen, but just to warn you of
all the possibilities, stay together near the door until I arrive. She
looked at them, her eyes filled with tears, there they were, as
dependent on her as little children on their mother. If I should let
them down—she thought. It did not occur to her that all around her the
people were blind yet managed to live, she herself would also have to
turn blind in order to understand that people get used to anything,
especially if they have ceased to be people, and even if they have not
quite reached that point, take the boy with the squint there, for
example, who no longer even asks for his mother. She went out to the
street, looked and made a mental note of the door number, the name of
the shop, now she had to check out the name of the street on that
corner, she had no idea where this search for food might take her, or
what food, it might be only three doors away or three hundred, she could
not afford to get lost, there would be no one from whom to ask the way,
those who could see before were blind, and she, who could see, would not
know where she was. The sun had broken through, it shone on the pools of
water that had formed amidst the litter and it was easier to see the
weeds that were sprouting up between the paving stones. There were more
people outside. How do they find their way around, the doctor’s wife
asked herself. They did not find their way around, they kept very close
to the buildings with their arms stretched out before them, they were
constantly bumping into each other like ants on the trail, but when this
happened no one protested, nor did they have to say anything, one of the
families moved away from the wall, advanced along the wall opposite in
the other direction, and thus they proceeded and carried on until the
next encounter. Now and then they stopped, sniffed in the doorways of
the shops in the hope of catching the smell of food, whatever it might
be, then continued on their way, they turned a corner, disappeared from
sight, soon another group turned up, they did not seem to have found
what they were looking for. The doctor’s wife could move with greater
speed, she did not waste any time entering the shops to find out if
there were any edible goods, but it soon became clear that it would not
be easy to stock up in any quantity, the few grocers’ shops she found
seemed to have been devoured from inside and were like empty shells.</p>
<p>She had already travelled far from where she had left her husband and
companions, crossing and re-crossing streets, avenues, squares, when she
found herself in front of a supermarket. Inside it was no different,
empty shelves, overturned displays, in the middle wandered the blind,
most of them on all fours, sweeping up the filth on the floor with their
hands, hoping to find something they might be able to use, a can of
preserves that had withstood the pounding of those who had desperately
tried to open it, some packet or other, whatever the contents, a potato,
even if trampled, a crust of bread, even if as hard as stone. The
doctor’s wife thought, Despite everything, there must be something, the
place is vast. A blind man got to his feet and complained that a bit of
glass had got lodged in his knee, the blood was already trickling down
one leg. The blind persons in the group gathered round him, What
happened, what’s the matter, and he told them, A glass splinter in my
knee, Which one, The left one, one of the blind women crouched down.
Take care, there might be other pieces of glass around, she probed and
fumbled to distinguish one leg from the other, Here it is, she said, and
it’s still pricking in the flesh, one of the blind men started laughing,
Well if it’s pricking, make the most of it, and the others, both men and
women, joined in the laughter. Bringing her thumb and forefinger
together, a natural gesture that requires no training, the blind woman
removed the piece of glass, then bandaged the knee with a rag she found
in the bag over her shoulder, finally she cracked her own little joke to
the amusement of all, Nothing to be done, no more pricking, everyone
laughed, and the wounded man retorted, Whenever you feel the urge, we
can have a go and find out what pricks most, there certainly are no
married men and women in this group, since no one appeared to be
shocked, they must all be people with lax morals who enter into casual
relationships, unless the latter happen to be indeed husband and wife,
hence the liberties they take with each other, but they really do not
give that impression, and no married couple would say these things in
public. The doctor’s wife looked around her, whatever was still usable
was being disputed amidst punches that nearly always missed and much
jostling that made no distinction between friend and foe, and it
sometimes happened that the object provoking the struggle escaped from
their hands and ended up on the ground, waiting for someone to trip over
it, Hell, I’ll never get out of here, she thought, using an expression
that formed no part of her usual vocabulary, once more showing that the
force and nature of circumstances have considerable influence over
language, remember that soldier who said shit when ordered to surrender,
thereby absolving future expletives from the crime of bad manners in
less dangerous situations. Hell, I’ll never get out of here, she thought
again, and just as she was preparing to leave, another thought came to
her like a happy inspiration, In an establishment like this there must
be a storeroom, not necessarily a large deposit, for that would be
located elsewhere, probably some distance away, but back-up supplies of
certain products in constant demand. Excited at the idea, she began
looking for a closed door that might lead her to the cave of treasures,
but they were all open, and there inside, she found the same
devastation, the same blind people rummaging through the same litter.
Finally, in a dark corridor, where the light of day scarcely penetrated,
she saw what looked like a cargo lift. The metal doors were closed and
at the side there was another door, smooth, of the kind that slide on a
track, The basement, she thought, the blind people who got this far
found their path impeded, they must have realised there was an elevator,
but it didn’t occur to anyone that it was also normal for there to be a
staircase in the event of there being a power cut, for example, as was
now the case. She pushed the sliding door and received, almost
simultaneously, two overwhelming impressions, first, that of the total
darkness she would have to penetrate in order to reach the basement, and
then the unmistakable smell of food, even when stored in jars and
containers we call sealed, the fact is that hunger has always had a keen
sense of smell, the kind that penetrates through all barriers, just as
dogs do. She quickly turned back to rescue from the litter the plastic
bags she would need to transport the food, at the same time asking
herself, Without light, how am I to know what to take, she shrugged her
shoulders, what a stupid thing to worry about, her concern now, given
the state of weakness in which she found herself, ought to be whether
she would have the strength to carry the bags once they were full,
retrace her steps back from where she had come, at that moment, she was
gripped by the most awful fear, that of not being able to return to the
spot where her husband was waiting for her, she knew the name of the
street, this she had not forgotten, but she had taken so many turnings,
despair paralysed her, then slowly, as if her arrested brain had finally
started to move, she saw herself bent over a map of the city, searching
with the tip of her finger for the shortest route, as if she had two
sets of eyes, one set watching her consult the map, another perusing the
map and working out the route. The corridor remained deserted, a stroke
of luck, given her nervous state because of the discovery she had made,
she had forgotten to close the door. She now closed it carefully behind
her only to find herself plunged into total darkness, as sightless as
those blind people out there, the only difference was in the colour, if
black and white can, strictly speaking, be thought of as colours.
Keeping close to the wall, she began to descend the stairs, if this
place should turn out not to be a secret, after all, and someone were to
rise from the depths, they would have to proceed as she had seen on the
street, one of them would have to abandon the safety of having somewhere
to lean against, brushing against the vague presence of the other,
perhaps for an instant foolishly fearing that the wall did not continue
on the other side, I’m going mad, she thought, and with good reason,
making this descent into a dark pit, without light or any hope of seeing
any, how far would it be, these underground stores are usually never
very deep, first flight of steps, Now I know what it means to be blind,
second flight of steps, I’m going to scream, I’m going to scream, third
set of steps, the darkness is like a thick paste that sticks to her
face, her eyes transformed into balls of pitch, What is this before me,
and then another thought, even more terrifying, And how shall I find the
stairs again, a sudden unsteadiness obliged her to crouch down in order
to avoid simply falling over, almost fainting, she stammered, It’s
clean, she was referring to the floor, it seemed remarkable to her, a
clean floor. Little by little she recovered her senses, she felt dull
pains in her stomach, not that this was anything new, but at this moment
it was as if there were no other living organ in her body, there had to
be others, but they gave no sign of being there, her heart, yes, her
heart was pounding like a great drum, for ever working blindly in the
dark, from the first of all darknesses, the womb in which it was formed,
to the last where it would cease. She was still clutching the plastic
bags, she had not let go of them, now all she had to do was to fill
them, calmly, a storeroom is not a place for ghosts and dragons, here
there is nothing but darkness, and darkness neither bites nor offends,
as for the stairway I’m bound to find it, even if it means walking all
the way round this awful place. Her mind made up, she was about to get
to her feet, but then remembered she was as blind as all the others,
better to do as they did, to advance on all fours until she came across
something, shelves laden with food, whatever it might be, so long as it
can be eaten as it is, without having to be cooked or specially
prepared, since there is no time for fancy cooking.</p>
<p>Her fear crept surreptitiously back, she had scarcely gone a few
metres, perhaps she was mistaken, perhaps right there before her,
invisible, a dragon was waiting for her with its mouth open. Or a ghost
with outstretched hand, to carry her off to the dreadful world of the
dead who never cease to die, because someone always comes to resuscitate
them. Then, prosaically, with an infinite, resigned sadness, it occurred
to her that the place where she found herself was not a store for food,
but a garage, she actually thought she could smell the gasoline, the
mind suffers delusions when it succumbs to the monsters it has itself
created. Then her hand touched something, not the ghost’s viscous
fingers, not the fiery tongue and fangs of the dragon, what she felt was
the contact of cold metal, a smooth vertical surface, she guessed,
without knowing what it was called, that this was the upright of a set
of shelves, She calculated there must be others just like this, standing
parallel to this one, as was the custom, it was now a question of
finding out where the food products were, not here, for this smell is
unmistakable, it is the smell of detergent. Without giving another
thought to the difficulties she would have in finding the stairs, she
began investigating the shelves, groping, sniffing, shaking. There were
cardboard containers, glass and plastic bottles, jars of all sizes, tins
that were probably preserves, various cartons, packets, bags, tubes. She
filled one of the bags at random, Could all this be for eating, she
thought to herself with some disquiet. The doctor’s wife passed on to
the next set of shelves, and the unexpected happened, her blind hand
that could not see where it was going, came up against and knocked over
some tiny boxes. The noise they made on hitting the floor almost made
her heart stop beating, Matches, she thought. Trembling with excitement,
she stooped down, ran her hand over the ground, found what she was
looking for, this is a smell one never confuses with any other, and the
noise of the little match-sticks when we shake the box, the sliding of
the lid, the roughness of the sand-paper on the outside, which is where
the phosphorus is, the scraping of the match-head, finally the sparking
of the tiny flame, the surrounding space a diffuse sphere as luminous as
a star glimmering through the mist, dear God, light exists and I have
eyes to see, praised be light. From now on, the harvest would be easy.
She began with the boxes of matches, and almost filled a bag. No need to
take all of them, the voice of common sense told her, then the
flickering flames of the matches lit up the shelves, over here, then
over there, soon the bags were full, the first had to be emptied because
it contained nothing useful, the others already held enough riches to
buy the city, nor need we be surprised at this difference of values, we
need only recall that there was once a king who wanted to exchange his
kingdom for a horse, what would he not give were he dying of hunger and
was tempted by these plastic bags full of food. The stairway is there,
the way out to the right. But first, the doctor’s wife sits on the
ground, opens a packet of chorizo sausage, another with slices of black
bread, a bottle of water, and, without remorse, starts eating. If she
were not to eat now she would not have the strength to carry the
provisions where they were needed, she being the provider. When she had
finished, she slipped the bags over her arms, three on each side, and
with her hands raised before her, she went on striking matches until she
reached the stairs, then she climbed them with some effort, she still
had not digested her food, which needs time to pass from the stomach to
the muscles and nerves, and, in her case, to what had shown the greatest
resistance, her head. The door slid noiselessly open, And what if there
is someone in the corridor, thought the doctor’s wife, what shall I do.
There was no one, but she started asking herself again, What shall I do.
When she reached the exit, she could turn round and shout inside, There
is food at the end of the corridor, stairs lead to the store in the
cellar, make the most of it, I have left the door open. She could have
done it, but decided not to. Using her shoulder, she closed the door,
she told herself that it was better to say nothing, just imagine what
would happen, the blind inmates running all over the place like madmen,
a repetition of what happened in the mental asylum when fire broke out,
they would roll down the stairs, be trampled and crushed by those coming
behind, who would also stumble and fall, it is not the same thing to put
one’s foot on a firm step as to put it on a slippery body. And when the
food is finished, I shall be able to come back for more, she thought.
She now gripped the bags with her hands, took a deep breath, and
proceeded along the corridor. They would not be able to see her, but
there was the smell of what she had eaten, The sausage, what a fool I
was, it would be like a living trail. She gritted her teeth, clutched
the bags with all her strength, I must run, she said. She remembered the
blind man whose knee had been cut by a splinter of glass, If the same
thing happens to me, if I don’t look out and step on broken glass, we
may have forgotten that this woman is wearing no shoes, she still has
not had time to go to a shoeshop like blind people in the city, who
despite being unfortunates without sight, can at least choose footwear
by touch. She had to run, and she did. At first, she had tried to slip
through the groups of blind people, trying not to touch them, but this
obliged her to go slowly, to stop several times in order to ascertain
the way, enough to give off the smell of food, for auras are not only
perfumed and ethereal ones, in no time a blind man was shouting, Who’s
eating sausage around here, no sooner were those words spoken than the
doctor’s wife threw caution to the wind and broke into reckless flight,
colliding, jostling, knocking people over, with a devil-may-care
attitude that was wholly reprehensible, for this is not the way to treat
blind people who have more than enough reasons to be unhappy.</p>
<p>When she reached the street, it was raining buckets, All the better,
she thought, panting for breath, her legs shaking, in this rain the
smell will be less noticeable. Someone had grabbed the last rag that had
barely covered her from the waist up, she was now going around with her
breasts exposed and glistening, a refined expression, with the water
from heaven, this was not liberty leading the people, the bags,
fortunately full, are too heavy for her to carry them aloft like a flag.
This is somewhat inconvenient, since these tantalising odours are
travelling at a height that brings dogs on the scent, of course without
masters to look after them and feed them, there is virtually a pack of
them following the doctor’s wife, let’s hope none of these hounds
remembers to take a bite to test the resistance of the plastic. In a
downpour like this, which is almost becoming a deluge, you would expect
people to be taking shelter, waiting for the weather to improve. But
this is not the case, there are blind people everywhere gaping up at the
heavens, slaking their thirst, storing up water in every nook and cranny
of their bodies, and others, who are somewhat more far-sighted, and
above all sensible, hold up buckets, bowls and pans, and raise them to
the generous sky, clearly God provides the cloud according to the
thirst. The possibility had not occurred to the doctor’s wife that not
so much as a drop of the precious liquid was coming from the taps in the
houses, this is the drawback of civilisation, we are so used to the
convenience of piped water brought into our homes, and forget that for
this to happen there have to be people to open and close distribution
valves, water towers and pumps that require electrical energy, computers
to regulate the deficits and administer the reserves, and all of these
operations require the use of one’s eyes. Eyes are also needed to see
this picture, a woman laden with plastic bags, going along a
rain-drenched street, amidst rotting litter and human and animal
excrement, cars and trucks abandoned any old way, blocking the main
thoroughfare, some of the vehicles with their tyres already surrounded
by grass, and the blind, the blind, open-mouthed and staring up at the
white sky, it seems incredible that rain should fall from such a sky.
The doctor’s wife reads the street signs as she goes along, she
remembers some of them, others not at all, and there comes a moment when
she realises that she has lost her way. There is no doubt, she is lost.
She took a turning, then another, she no longer remembers the streets or
their names, then in her distress, she sat down on the filthy ground,
thick with black mud, and, drained of any strength, of all strength, she
burst into tears. The dogs gathered round her, sniffed at the bags, but
without much conviction, as if their hour for eating had passed, one of
them licks her face, perhaps it had been used to drying tears ever since
it was a puppy. The woman strokes its head, runs her hand down its
drenched back, and she weeps the rest of her tears embracing the dog.
When she finally raised her eyes, the god of crossroads be praised a
thousand times, she saw a great map before her, of the kind that town
councils set up throughout city centres, especially for the benefit and
reassurance of visitors, who are just as anxious to say where they have
been as to know precisely where they are. Now that everyone is blind,
you might be tempted to think that the money has been ill-spent, but it
is a question of being patient, of letting time take its course, we
should have learnt this once and for all, that destiny has to make many
turnings before arriving anywhere, destiny alone knows what it has cost
to bring this map here in order to let this woman know where she is. She
was not as far away as she thought, she had simply made a detour in the
other direction, all you have to do is to follow this street until you
come to the square, there you count two streets to the left, then you
take the first street on the right, that is the one you are looking for,
the number you have not forgotten. The dogs gradually left her,
something distracted them on the way, or they are familiar with the
district and are reluctant to stray too far, only the dog that has dried
her tears accompanied the person who had wept them, probably this
encounter of the woman and the map, so well prepared by destiny,
included the dog as well. The fact is that they entered the shop
together, the dog of tears was not surprised to see people lying on the
ground, so still that they might have been dead, the dog was used to
this, sometimes they let him sleep amongst them, and when it was time to
get up, they were nearly always alive. Wake up, if you’re asleep, I’ve
brought food, said the doctor’s wife, but first she had closed the door,
in case anyone passing in the street should hear her. The boy with the
squint was the first to raise his head, weakness prevented him from
doing any more, the others took a little longer, they were dreaming they
were stones, and we all know how deeply stones sleep, a simple stroll in
the countryside shows it to be so, there they lie sleeping, half buried,
awaiting who knows what awakening. The word food, however, has magic
powers, especially when hunger is pressing, even the dog of tears, who
knows no language, began wagging its tail, this instinctive movement
reminded it that it still had not done what is expected of wet dogs, to
shake themselves vigorously, splashing everything around, for them it is
easy, they wear their pelt as if it were a coat. Holy water of the most
efficacious variety, descended directly from heaven, the splashes helped
the stones to transform themselves into persons, while the doctor’s wife
participated in this process of metamorphosis by opening the plastic
bags one after the other. Not everything smelled of what it contained,
but the aroma of a chunk of stale bread would be as good, speaking in
exalted terms, as the essence of life itself. They are all awake at
last, their hands are shaking, their faces anxious, it is then that the
doctor, as had happened before to the dog of tears, remembers who he is,
Careful, it’s not a good idea to eat too much, it could be harmful,
What’s doing us harm is hunger, said the first blind man, Take heed of
what the doctor is saying, his wife rebuked him, and her husband fell
silent, thinking with faint resentment, He doesn’t even know anything
about eyes, unjust words these, especially if we take into account that
the doctor is no less blind than the others, the proof being that he was
unaware that his wife was naked from the waist up, it was she who asked
him for his jacket to cover herself, the other blind inmates looked in
her direction, but it was much too late, if only they had looked
before.</p>
<p>As they were eating, the woman told them of her adventures, of
everything that had happened to her and everything that she had done,
without mentioning that she had left the door to the storeroom closed,
she was not entirely sure of the humanitarian motives she had given to
herself, to compensate she told them about the blind man who got a piece
of glass stuck in his knee, they all laughed heartily, well, not all of
them, the old man with the black eyepatch only reacted with a weary
smile, and the boy with the squint had ears only for the noise he made
as he chewed his food. The dog of tears received his share, which he
quickly repaid by barking furiously when anyone outside shook the door
hard. Whoever it was, they did not persist, there was talk of mad dogs
going around, not knowing where I’m putting my feet makes me quite mad
enough. Calm was restored, and it was then, when everyone’s initial
hunger had been assuaged, that the doctor’s wife related the
conversation she had had with the man who had come out of this same shop
to see if it was raining. Then she concluded, If what he told me is
true, we cannot be certain of finding our homes as we left them, we
don’t even know whether we shall be able to get into them, I’m speaking
of those who forgot to take the keys when they left, or lost them, we,
for example, do not have them, they disappeared in the fire, it would be
impossible to find them now amongst the ashes, she uttered that word and
it was as if she were seeing the flames devouring her scissors, first
burning the congealed blood that remained on them, then licking at the
edges the sharp points, blunting them, and gradually making them dull,
pliable, soft, formless, no one would believe that this instrument could
have perforated someone’s throat, once the fire has done its work it
will be impossible in this unified mass of molten metal, to distinguish
which are the scissors and which the keys, I’ve got the keys, said the
doctor, and awkwardly introducing three fingers into a small pocket near
the waistband of his tattered trousers, he brought out a tiny ring with
three keys, How do you happen to have them when I had put them in my
handbag which got left behind, I removed them, I was afraid they might
get lost, I felt they were safer if they were always with me, and it was
also a way of convincing myself that one day we would go back home, It’s
a relief to have the keys, but we might find the house with the door
smashed in, They may not even have tried. For some moments, they had
forgotten the others, but now it was important to know, from all of
them, what had happened to their keys, the first to speak was the girl
with dark glasses, My parents remained at home when the ambulance came
to fetch me, I don’t know what became of them afterwards, then the old
man with the black eyepatch spoke up, I was at home when I went blind,
they knocked at the door, the owner of the house came to tell me there
were some male nurses looking for me, it wasn’t the moment to be
thinking about keys, that left only the wife of the first blind man, but
she said, I cannot say, I’ve forgotten, she knew and remembered, but
what she did not wish to confess is that when she suddenly saw that she
was blind, an absurd expression, but so deeply rooted in the language
that we’ve been unable to avoid it, she had run from the house
screaming, calling out to her neighbours, those who were still in the
building thought twice about going to her assistance, and she, who had
shown herself so steadfast and capable when her husband had been struck
by this misfortune, now went to pieces, abandoning her home with the
door wide open, it did not even occur to her to ask that they should
allow her to turn back, just for a minute, the time to close the door
and say I’ll be right back. No one asked the boy with the squint about
the key to his house, since he cannot even remember where he lives. Then
the doctor’s wife gently touched the hand of the girl with dark glasses,
Let’s start with your house which is nearest, but first we must find
some clothes and shoes, we can’t go around like this, unwashed and in
rags. She started to get up, but noticed that the boy with the squint,
consoled by now and his hunger satisfied, had gone back to sleep. She
said, let’s rest then, let’s sleep a little, then later we can go and
see what awaits us. She took off her drenched skirt, then, to find some
warmth, she snuggled up to her husband, and the first blind man and his
wife did the same. Is that you, he had asked, she remembered their home
and it pained her, she did not say, Console me, but it was as if she had
thought it, what we do not know is what feeling could have led the girl
with dark glasses to put her arm round the shoulder of the old man with
the black eyepatch, but there is no doubt that she did so, and there
they remained, she sleeping, but not him. The dog went to lie down at
the door, blocking the entrance, he is a gruff, ill-tempered animal when
he does not have to dry someone’s tears.</p>
