<h4 id="section">4</h4>
<p>The suggestion had come from the minister himself. It was, whichever
way one looked at it, a fortunate not to say perfect idea, both from the
point of view of the merely sanitary aspects of the case and from that
of the social implications and their political consequences. Until the
causes were established, or, to use the appropriate terms, the etiology
of the white evil, as, thanks to the inspiration of an imaginative
assessor, this unpleasant-sounding blindness came to be called, until
such time as treatment and a cure might be found, and perhaps a vaccine
that might prevent the appearance of any cases in the future, all the
people who had turned blind, as well as those who had been in physical
contact or in any way close to these patients, should be rounded up and
isolated so as to avoid any further cases of contagion, which, once
confirmed, would multiply more or less according to what is
mathematically referred to as a compound ratio. Quod erat demonstrandum,
concluded the Minister. According to the ancient practice, inherited
from the time of cholera and yellow fever, when ships that were
contaminated or suspected of carrying infection had to remain out at sea
for forty days, and in words within the grasp of the general public, it
was a matter of putting all these people into quarantine, until further
notice. These very words, Until further notice, apparently deliberate,
but, in fact, enigmatic since he could not think of any others, were
pronounced by the Minister, who later clarified his thinking, I meant
that this could as easily mean forty days as forty weeks, or forty
months, or forty years, the important thing is that they should stay in
quarantine. Now we have to decide where we are going to put them,
Minister, said the President of the Commission of Logistics and Security
set up rapidly for the purpose and responsible for the transportation,
isolation and supervision of the patients, What immediate facilities are
available, the Minister wanted to know, We have a mental hospital
standing empty until we decide what to do with it, several military
installations which are no longer being used because of the recent
restructuring of the army, a building designed for a trade fair that is
nearing completion, and there is even, although no one has been able to
explain why, a supermarket about to go into liquidation, In your
opinion, which of these buildings would best suit our purpose, The
barracks offer the greatest security, Naturally, There is, however, one
drawback, the size of the place is likely to make it both difficult and
costly to keep an eye on those interned, Yes, I can see that, As for the
supermarket, we would probably run up against various legal obstacles,
legal matters that would have to be taken into account, And what about
the building for the trade fair, That’s the one site I think we should
ignore, Minister, Why, Industry wouldn’t like it, millions have been
invested in the project, So that leaves the mental hospital, Yes,
Minister, the mental hospital, Well then, let’s opt for the mental
hospital, Besides, to all appearances, it’s the place that offers the
best facilities because not only does it have a perimeter wall, it also
has the advantage of having two separate wings, one to be used for those
who are actually blind, the other for those suspected of having the
disease, as well as a central area which will serve, as it were, as a no
man’s land, through which those who turn blind will pass to join those
who are already blind, There might be a problem, What is that, Minister,
We shall find ourselves obliged to put staff there to supervise the
transfers, and I doubt whether we will be able to count on volunteers, I
doubt whether that will be necessary, Minister, Why, Should anyone
suspected of infection turn blind, as will naturally happen sooner or
later, you may be sure, Minister, that the others who still have their
sight, will turn him out at once, You’re right, Just as they would not
allow in any blind person who suddenly felt like changing places, Good
thinking, Thank you, Minister, may I give orders to proceed, Yes, you
have carte blanche.</p>
<p>The Commission acted with speed and efficiency. Before nightfall,
everyone who was known to be blind had been rounded up, as well as a
considerable number of people who were assumed to be affected, at least
those whom it had been possible to identify and locate in a rapid search
operation carried out above all in the domestic and professional circles
of those stricken with loss of vision. The first to be taken to the
empty mental hospital were the doctor and his wife. There were soldiers
on guard. The main gate was opened just enough to allow them to pass
through, and then closed at once. Serving as a handrail, a thick rope
stretched from the entrance to the main door of the building, Move a
little to the right, there you will find a rope, grab it with your hand
and go straight on, straight on until you come to some steps, there are
six steps in all, the sergeant warned them. Once inside, the rope
divided into two, one strand going to the left, the other to the right,
the sergeant shouted, Keep to the right. As she dragged the suitcase
along, the woman guided her husband to the ward that was nearest to the
entrance. It was a long room, like a ward in an old-fashioned hospital,
with two rows of beds that had been painted grey, although the paint had
been peeling off for quite some time. The covers, the sheets and the
blankets were of the same colour. The woman guided her husband to the
far end of the ward, made him sit on one of the beds, and told him, Stay
here, I’m going to look around. There were more wards, long and narrow
corridors, rooms that must have been the doctors’ offices, dingy
latrines, a kitchen that still reeked of bad cooking, a vast refectory
with zinc-topped tables, three padded cells in which the bottom six feet
of the walls had padding and the rest was lined with cork. Behind the
building there was an abandoned yard, with neglected trees, their trunks
looking as if they had been flayed. There was litter everywhere. The
doctor’s wife went back inside. In a half-open cupboard she found
strait-jackets. When she rejoined her husband, she asked him, Can you
imagine where they’ve brought us, No, she was about to add, To a mental
asylum, but he anticipated her, You’re not blind, I cannot allow you to
stay here, Yes, you’re right, I’m not blind, Then I’m going to ask them
to take you home, to tell them that you told a lie in order to remain
with me, There’s no point, they cannot hear you through there, and even
if they could, they would pay no attention, But you can see, For the
moment, I shall almost certainly turn blind myself one of these days, or
any minute now, Please, go home, Don’t insist, besides, I’ll bet the
soldiers would not let me get as far as the stairs, I cannot force you,
No, my love, you can’t, I’m staying to help you and the others who may
come here, but don’t tell them I can see, What others, You surely don’t
think we shall be here on our own, This is madness, What did you expect,
we’re in a mental asylum.</p>
<p>The other blind people arrived together. One after another, they had
been apprehended at home, first of all the man driving the car, then the
man who had stolen it, the girl with dark glasses, the boy with the
squint whom they traced to the hospital where his mother had taken him.
His mother did not come with him, she lacked the ingenuity of the
doctor’s wife who de clared herself blind when there was nothing wrong
with her eyesight, she is a simple soul, incapable of lying, even when
it is for her own good. They came stumbling into the ward, clutching at
the air, here there was no rope to guide them, they would have to learn
from painful experience, the boy was weeping, calling out for his
mother, and it was the girl with dark glasses who tried to console him,
She’s coming, she’s coming, she told him, and since she was wearing her
dark glasses she could just as well have been blind as not, the others
moved their eyes from one side to another, and could see nothing, while
because the girl was wearing those glasses, and saying, She’s coming,
she’s coming, it was as if she really could see the boy’s desperate
mother coming in through the door. The doctor’s wife leaned over and
whispered into her husband’s ear, Four more have arrived, a woman, two
men and a boy, What do the men look like, asked the doctor in a low
voice, She described them, and he told her, The latter I don’t know, the
other, from your description, might well be the blind man who came to
see me at the surgery. The child has a squint and the girl is wearing
dark glasses, she seems attractive, Both of them came to the surgery.
Because of the din they were making as they searched for a place where
they might feel safe, the new arrivals did not hear this conversation,
they must have thought that there was no one else like themselves there,
and they had not been without their sight long enough for their sense of
hearing to have become keener than normal. At last, as if they had
reached the conclusion that it was not worth while exchanging certainty
for doubt, each of them sat on the first bed they had stumbled upon, so
to speak, the two men ending up beside each other, without their
knowing. In a low voice, the girl continued to console the boy, Don’t
cry, you’ll see that your mother won’t be long. There was silence, then
the doctor’s wife said so that she could be heard all the way down the
ward as far as the door, There are two of us here, how many are you. The
unexpected voice startled the new arrivals, but the two men remained
silent, and it was the girl who replied, I think there are four of us,
myself and this little boy, Who else, why don’t the others speak up,
asked the doctor’s wife, I’m here, murmured a man’s voice, as if he
could only pronounce the words with difficulty, And so am I, growled in
turn another masculine voice with obvious displeasure. The doctor’s wife
thought to herself, They’re behaving as if they were afraid of getting
to know each other. She watched them twitching, tense, their necks
craned as if they were sniffing at something, yet curiously, their
expressions were all the same, threatening and at the same time afraid,
but the fear of one was not the fear of the other, and this was no less
true of the threats they offered. What could be going on between them,
she wondered.</p>
<p>At that moment, a loud, gruff voice was raised, by someone whose tone
suggested he was used to giving orders. It came from a loudspeaker fixed
above the door by which they had entered. The word Attention was uttered
three times, then the voice began, the Government regrets having been
forced to exercise with all urgency what it considers to be its rightful
duty, to protect the population by all possible means in this present
crisis, when something with all the appearance of an epidemic of
blindness has broken out, provisionally known as the white sickness, and
we are relying on the public spirit and cooperation of all citizens to
stem any further contagion, assuming that we are dealing with a
contagious disease and that we are not simply witnessing a series of as
yet inexplicable coincidences. The decision to gather together in one
place all those infected, and, in adjacent but separate quarters all
those who have had any kind of contact with them, was not taken without
careful consideration. The Government is fully aware of its
responsibilities and hopes that those to whom this message is directed
will, as the upright citizens they doubtless are, also assume their
responsi bilities, bearing in mind that the isolation in which they now
find themselves will represent, above any personal considerations, an
act of solidarity with the rest of the nation’s community. That said, we
ask everyone to listen attentively to the following instructions, first,
the lights will be kept on at all times, any attempt to tamper with the
switches will be useless, they don’t work, second, leaving the building
without authorisation will mean instant death, third, in each ward there
is a telephone that can be used only to requisition from outside fresh
supplies for purposes of hygiene and cleanliness, fourth, the internees
will be responsible for washing their own clothes by hand, fifth, it is
recommended that ward representatives should be elected, this is a
recommendation rather than an order, the internees must organise
themselves as they see fit, provided they comply with the aforesaid
rules and those we are about to announce, sixth, three times daily
containers with food will be deposited at the main door, on the right
and on the left, destined respectively for the patients and those
suspected of being contaminated, seventh, all the left-overs must be
burnt, and this includes not only any food, but also the containers,
plates and cutlery which are all made of combustible material, eighth,
the burning should be done in the inner courtyards of the building or in
the exercise yard, ninth, the internees are responsible for any damage
caused by these fires, tenth, in the event of a fire getting out of
control, whether accidentally or on purpose, the firemen will not
intervene, eleventh, equally, the internees cannot count on any outside
intervention should there be any outbreaks of illnesses, nor in the
event of any disorder or aggression, twelfth, in the case of death,
whatever the cause, the internees will bury the corpse in the yard
without any formalities, thirteenth, contact between the wing of the
patients and that of the people suspected of being contagious must be
made in the central hall of the building by which they entered,
fourteenth, should those suspected of being infected suddenly go blind,
they will be transferred immediately to the other wing, fifteenth, this
communication will be relayed daily at the same time for the benefit of
all new arrivals. The Government and Nation expect every man and woman
to do their duty. Good night.</p>
<p>In the silence that followed, the boy’s voice could be clearly heard,
I want my mummy, but the words were articulated without expression, like
some automatic and repeater mechanism that had previously left a phrase
suspended and was blurting it out now, at the wrong time. The doctor
said, The orders we have just been given leave no room for doubt, we’re
isolated, probably more isolated than anyone has ever been and without
any hope of getting out of this place until a cure is found for this
disease, I recognise your voice, said the girl with dark glasses, I’m a
doctor, an ophthalmologist, You must be the doctor I consulted
yesterday, I recognise your voice, Yes, and who are you, I’ve been
suffering from conjunctivitis and I assume it hasn’t cleared up, but
now, since I’m completely blind, it’s of no importance, And the child
who’s with you, He’s not mine, I have no children, Yesterday I examined
a boy with a squint, was that you, the doctor asked, Yes, that was me,
the boy’s reply came out with the resentful tone of someone who prefers
people not to mention his physical defect, and with good reason, for
such defects, these as much as any others, are no sooner mentioned than
they pass from being barely perceptible to being all too obvious. Is
there anyone else here I know, the doctor asked, could the man who came
to see me at the surgery yesterday accompanied by his wife be here by
any chance, the man who suddenly went blind when out driving his car,
That’s me, replied the first blind man, Is there anyone else, please
speak up, we are obliged to live here together for who knows how long,
therefore it is essential that we should get to know each other. The
car-thief muttered between his teeth, Yes, yes, he thought this would be
sufficient to confirm his presence, but the doctor insisted, The voice
is that of someone who is relatively young, you’re not the elderly
patient with the cataract, No doctor, that’s not me, How did you go
blind, I was walking along the street, And what else, Nothing else, I
was walking along the street and I suddenly went blind. The doctor was
about to ask if his blindness was also white, but stopped himself in
time, why bother, whatever his reply, no matter whether his blindness
was white or black, they would not get out of this place. He stretched
out a hesitant hand to his wife and met her hand on the way. She kissed
him on the cheek, no one else could see that wrinkled forehead, that
tight mouth, those dead eyes, like glass, terrifying because they
appeared to see and did not see, My time will come too, she thought,
perhaps even at this very instant, not allowing me to finish what I am
saying, at any moment, just as happened to them, or perhaps I’ll wake up
blind, or go blind as I close my eyes to sleep, thinking I’ve just dozed
off.</p>
<p>She looked at the four blind people, they were sitting on their beds,
the little luggage they had been able to bring at their feet, the boy
with his school satchel, the others with suitcases, small, as if they
had packed for the weekend. The girl with dark glasses was conversing in
a low voice with the boy, on the row opposite, close to each other, with
only an empty bed between them, the first blind man and the car-thief
were, without realising it, sitting face to face. The doctor said, We
all heard the orders, whatever happens now, one thing we can be sure of,
no one will come to our assistance, therefore we ought to start getting
organised without delay, because it won’t be long before this ward fills
up with people, this one and the others, How do you know there are more
wards here, asked the girl, We went around the place before deciding on
this ward which is closer to the main entrance, explained the doctor’s
wife, as she squeezed her husband’s arm as if warning him to be
cautious. The girl said, it would be better, doctor, if you were to take
charge of the ward, after all, you are a doctor. What good is a doctor
without eyes or medicines, But you have some authority. The doctor’s
wife smiled, I think you should accept, if the others are in agreement,
of course, I don’t think it’s such a good idea, Why not, For the moment
there are only six of us here, but by tomorrow we shall certainly be
more, people will start arriving every day, it would be too much to
expect that they should be prepared to accept the authority of someone
they have not chosen and who, moreover, would have nothing to offer them
in exchange for their respect, always assuming they were willing to
accept my authority and my rules, Then it’s going to be difficult to
live here, We’ll be very fortunate if it turns out to be only difficult.
The girl with dark glasses said, I meant well, but frankly, doctor, you
are right, it will be a case of everyone for himself.</p>
<p>Either because he was moved by these words or because he could no
longer contain his fury, one of the men got abruptly to his feet, This
fellow is to blame for our misfortune, if I had my eyesight now, I’d do
him in, he bellowed, while pointing in the direction where he thought
the other man to be. He was not all that far off, but his dramatic
gesture was comical because his jabbing, accusing finger was pointing at
an innocent bedside table. Keep calm, said the doctor, no one’s to blame
in an epidemic, everyone’s a victim, If I hadn’t been the decent fellow
I am, if I hadn’t helped him to find his way home, I’d still have my
precious eyes, Who are you, asked the doctor, but the complainant did
not reply and now seemed annoyed that he had said anything. Then the
other man spoke, He took me home, it’s true, but then took advantage of
my condition to steal my car, That’s a lie, I didn’t steal anything, You
most certainly did, If anyone nicked your car, it wasn’t me, my reward
for carrying out a kind action was to lose my sight, besides, where are
the witnesses, that’s what I’d like to know. This argument won’t solve
anything, said the doctor’s wife, the car is outside, the two of you are
in here, better to make your peace, don’t forget we are going to have to
live here together, You can count me out, said the first blind man, I’m
off to another ward, as far away as possible from this crook who was
capable of robbing a blind man, he claims that he turned blind because
of me, well let him stay blind, at least it shows there is still some
justice in this world. He picked up his suitcase and, shuffling his feet
so as not to trip and groping with his free hand, he went along the
aisle separating the two rows of beds, Where are the other wards, he
asked, but did not hear the reply if there was one, because suddenly he
found himself beneath an onslaught of arms and legs, the car-thief was
carrying out as best he could his threat to take his revenge on this man
who had caused all his misfortunes. One minute on top, the next
underneath, they rolled about in the confined space, colliding now and
then with the legs of the beds, while, terrified once more, the boy with
the squint started crying again and calling out for his mother. The
doctor’s wife took her husband by the arm, she knew that alone she would
never be able to persuade them to stop quarrelling, she led him along
the passageway to the spot where the enraged opponents were panting for
breath as they struggled on the ground. She guided her husband’s hands,
she herself took charge of the blind man whom she found more manageable,
and with much effort, they managed to separate them. You’re behaving
foolishly, said the doctor angrily, if your idea is to turn this place
into a hell, then you’re going about it in the right way, but remember
we’re on our own here, we can expect no outside help, do you hear, He
stole my car, whimpered the first blind man who had come off worst in
the exchange of blows, Forget it, what does it matter, said the doctor’s
wife, you were no longer in a condition to drive the car when it
disappeared, That’s all very well, but it was mine, and this villain
took it and left it who knows where, Most likely, said the doctor, the
car is to be found at the spot where this man turned blind, You’re an
astute fellow, doctor, yes sir, no doubt about that, piped up the thief.
The first blind man made a gesture as if to escape from the hands
holding him, but without really trying, as if aware that not even his
sense of outrage, however justified, would bring back his car, nor would
the car restore his sight. But the thief threatened, If you think you’re
going to get away with this, then you’re very much mistaken, all right,
I stole your car, but you stole my eyesight, so who’s the bigger thief,
That’s enough, the doctor protested, we’re all blind here and we’re not
accusing or pointing the finger at anyone, I’m not interested in other
people’s misfortunes, the thief replied contemptuously, If you want to
go to another ward, said the doctor to the first blind man, my wife will
guide you there, she knows her way around better than me, No thanks,
I’ve changed my mind, I prefer to stay in this one. The thief mocked
him, The little boy is afraid of being on his own in case a certain
bogeyman gets him, That’s enough, shouted the doctor, losing his
patience, Now listen to me, doctor, snarled the thief, we’re all equal
here and you don’t give me any orders, No one is giving orders, I’m
simply asking you to leave this poor fellow in peace, Fine, fine, but
watch your step when you’re dealing with me, I’m not easy to handle when
somebody gets up my nose, otherwise I’m as good a friend as you’re
likely to meet, but the worst enemy you could possibly have. With
aggressive movements and gestures, the thief fumbled for the bed where
he had been sitting, pushed his suitcase underneath, then announced, I’m
going to get some sleep, as if warning them, You’d better look the other
way, I’m going to take my clothes off. The girl with dark glasses said
to the boy with the squint, And you’d better get into bed as well, stay
on this side and if you need anything during the night, call me, I want
to do a wee-wee, the boy said. On hearing him, all of them felt a sudden
and urgent desire to urinate, and their thoughts were more or less as
follows, Now how are we going to cope with this problem, the first blind
man groped under the bed to see if there was a chamber pot, yet at the
same time hoping he would not find one for he would be embarrassed if he
had to urinate in the presence of other people, not that they could see
him, of course, but the noise of someone peeing is indiscreet,
unmistakable, men at least can use a strategy denied women, in this they
are more fortunate. The thief had sat down on the bed and was now
saying, Shit, where do you have to go to piss in this place, Watch your
language, there’s a child here, protested the girl with dark glasses,
Certainly, sweetheart, but unless you can find a lavatory, it won’t be
long before your little boy has pee running down his legs. The doctor’s
wife intervened, Perhaps I can locate the toilets, I can remember having
smelt them, I’ll come with you, said the girl with dark glasses, taking
the boy by the hand, I think it best that we should all go, the doctor
observed, then we shall know the way whenever we need to go, I know
what’s on your mind, the car-thief thought to himself without daring to
say it aloud, what you don’t want is that your little wife should have
to take me to pee every time I feel the urge. The implication behind
that thought gave him a small erection that surprised him, as if the
fact of being blind should have as a consequence, the loss or diminution
of sexual desire. Good, he thought, all is not lost, after all, among
the dead and the wounded someone will escape, and, drifting away from
the conversation, he began to daydream. He didn’t get very far, the
doctor was already saying, Let’s form a line, my wife will lead the way,
everyone put their hand on the shoulder of the person in front, then
there will be no danger of our getting lost. The first blind man spoke
up, I’m not going anywhere with him, obviously referring to the crook
who had robbed him.</p>
<p>Whether to look for each other or to avoid each other, they could
scarcely move in the narrow aisle, all the more so since the doctor’s
wife had to proceed as if she were blind. At last, they were all in
line, the girl with dark glasses led the boy with the squint by the
hand, then the thief in underpants and a vest, the doctor behind him,
and last of all, safe for the moment from any physical attack, the first
blind man. They advanced very slowly, as if mistrustful of the person
guiding them, groping in vain with their free hand, searching for the
support of something solid, a wall, a door-frame. Placed behind the girl
with dark glasses, the thief, aroused by the perfume she exuded and by
the memory of his recent erection, decided to put his hands to better
use, the one caressing the nape of her neck beneath her hair, the other,
openly and unceremoniously fondling her breast. She wriggled to shake
him off, but he was grabbing her firmly. Then the girl gave a backward
kick as hard as she could. The heel of her shoe, sharp as a stiletto,
pierced the flesh of the thief’s bare thigh causing him to give a cry of
surprise and pain. What’s going on, asked the doctor’s wife, looking
back, I tripped, the girl with dark glasses replied, I seem to have
injured the person behind me. Blood was already seeping out between the
thief’s fingers who, moaning and cursing, was trying to ascertain the
consequences of her aggression, I’m injured, this bitch doesn’t look
where she’s putting her feet, And you don’t look where you’re putting
your hands, the girl replied curtly. The doctor’s wife understood what
had happened, at first she smiled, but then she saw how nasty the wound
looked, blood was trickling down the poor devil’s leg, and they had no
peroxide, no iodine, no plasters, no bandages, no disinfectant, nothing.
The line was now in disarray, the doctor was asking, Where is the wound,
Here, Here, where, On my leg, can’t you see, this bitch stuck the heel
of her shoe in me, I tripped, I couldn’t help it, repeated the girl
before blurting out in exasperation, The bastard was touching me up,
what sort of woman does he think I am. The doctor’s wife intervened,
This wound should be washed and dressed at once, And where is there any
water, asked the thief, In the kitchen, in the kitchen there is water,
but we don’t all have to go, my husband and I will take him there, you
others wait here, we’ll be back soon, I want to do weewee, said the boy,
Hold it in a bit longer, we’ll be right back. The doctor’s wife knew
that she had to turn once to the right, and once to the left, then
follow a narrow corridor that formed a right angle, the kitchen was at
the far end. After a few paces she pretended that she was mistaken,
stopped, retraced her footsteps, then said, Ah, now I remember, and from
there they headed straight for the kitchen, there was no more time to be
lost, the wound was bleeding profusely. At first, the water from the tap
was dirty, it took some time for it to become clear. It was lukewarm and
stale, as if it had been putrefying inside the pipes, but the wounded
man received it with a sigh of relief. The wound looked ugly. And now,
how are we going to bandage his leg, asked the doctor’s wife. Beneath a
table there were some filthy rags which must have been used as floor
cloths, but it would be most unwise to use them to make a bandage, There
doesn’t appear to be anything here, she said, while pretending to keep
up the search, But I can’t be left like this, doctor, the bleeding won’t
stop, please help me, and forgive me if I was rude to you a short time
ago, moaned the thief, We are trying to help you, otherwise we wouldn’t
be here, said the doctor and then he ordered him, Take off your vest,
there’s no other option. The wounded man mumbled that he needed his
vest, but took it off. The doctor’s wife lost no time in improvising a
bandage which she wrapped round his thigh, pulled tight and managed to
use the shoulder straps and the tail of the vest to tie a rough knot.
These were not movements a blind person could easily execute, but she
was in no mood to waste time with any more pretence, it was enough to
have pretended that she was lost. The thief sensed that there was
something unusual here, logically it was the doctor who, although no
more than an ophthalmologist, should have bandaged the wound, but the
consolation of knowing that something was being done outweighed the
doubts, vague as they were, that had momentarily crossed his mind. With
him limping along, they went back to rejoin the others, and once there,
the doctor’s wife spotted immediately that the boy with the squint had
not been able to hold out any longer and had wet his trousers. Neither
the first blind man nor the girl with glasses had realised what had
happened. At the boy’s feet spread a puddle of urine, the hem of his
trousers still dripping wet. But as if nothing had happened, the
doctor’s wife said, Let’s go and find these lavatories. The blind
stretched out their arms, looking for each other, though not the girl
with dark glasses who made it quite clear that she had no intention of
walking in front of that shameless creature who had touched her up, at
last the line was formed, the thief changing places with the first blind
man, with the doctor between them. The thief’s limp was getting worse
and he was dragging his leg. The tight bandage was bothering him and the
wound was throbbing so badly that it was as if his heart had changed
position and was lying at the bottom of some hole. The girl with dark
glasses was once again leading the boy by the hand, but he kept his
distance as much as possible, afraid that someone might discover his
accident, such as the doctor, who muttered, There’s a smell of urine
here, and his wife felt she should confirm his impression, Yes, there is
a smell, she could not say that it was coming from the lavatories
because they were still some distance away, and, being obliged to behave
as if she were blind, she could not reveal that the stench was coming
from the boy’s wet trousers.</p>
<p>They were agreed, both men and women, when they arrived at the
lavatories, that the boy should be the first to relieve himself, but the
men ended up going in together, without any distinction of urgency or
age, the urinal was communal, it would have to be in a place like this,
even the toilets. The women remained at the door, they are said to have
more resistance, but there’s a limit to everything, and the doctor’s
wife was soon suggesting, Perhaps there are other lavatories, but the
girl with dark glasses said, Speaking for myself, I can wait, So can I,
said the other woman, then there was a silence, then they began to
speak, How did you come to lose your sight, Like everyone else, suddenly
I could no longer see, Were you at home, No, So it happened when you
left my husband’s surgery, More or less, What do you mean by more or
less, That it didn’t happen right away, Did you feel any pain, No, there
was no pain but when I opened my eyes I was blind, With me it was
different, What do you mean by different, My eyes weren’t closed, I went
blind the moment my husband got into the ambulance, Fortunate, For whom,
Your husband, this way you can be together, In that case I was also
fortunate, You were, Are you married, No, no I’m not, and I don’t think
there will be any more marriages now, But this blindness is so abnormal,
so alien to scientific knowledge that it cannot last forever. And
suppose we were to stay like this for the rest of our lives, Us,
Everyone, That would be horrible, a world full of blind people, It
doesn’t bear thinking about.</p>
<p>The boy with the squint was the first to emerge from the lavatory, he
didn’t even need to have gone in there. He had rolled his trousers
halfway up his legs and removed his socks. He said, I’m back, whereupon
the girl with dark glasses moved in the direction of the voice, did not
succeed the first or second time, but at a third attempt found the boy’s
vacillating hand. Shortly afterwards, the doctor appeared, then the
first blind man, one of them asked, Where are the rest of you, the
doctor’s wife was already holding her husband’s arm, his other arm was
touched and grabbed by the girl with dark glasses. For several moments
the first blind man had no one to protect him, then someone placed a
hand on his shoulder. Are we all here, asked the doctor’s wife, The
fellow with the injured leg has stayed behind to satisfy another need,
her husband replied. Then the girl with dark glasses said, Perhaps there
are other toilets, I’m getting desperate, forgive me, Let’s go and find
out, said the doctor’s wife, and they went off hand in hand. Within ten
minutes they were back, they had found a consulting room which had its
own toilet. The thief had already reappeared, complaining about the cold
and the pain in his leg. They re-formed the line in the same order by
which they had come and, with less effort than before and without
incident, they returned to the ward. Adroitly, without appearing to do
so, the doctor’s wife helped each of them to reach the bed they had
previously occupied. Before entering the ward, as if it were
self-evident to everyone, she suggested that the easiest way for each of
them to find their place was to count the beds from the entrance, Ours,
she said, are the last ones on the right-hand side, beds nineteen and
twenty. The first to proceed down the aisle was the thief. Almost naked,
he was shivering from head to foot and anxious to alleviate the pain in
his leg, reason enough for him to be given priority. He went from bed to
bed, fumbling on the floor in search of his suitcase, and when he
recognised it, he said aloud, It’s here, then added, Fourteen, On which
side, asked the doctor’s wife, On the left, he replied, once again
vaguely surprised, as if she ought to know it without having to ask. The
first blind man went next. He knew his bed was next but one to the
thief’s and on the same side. He was no longer afraid of sleeping near
him, his leg was in such a dreadful state, and judging from his groans
and sighs, he would find it hard to move. On arriving there, he said,
Sixteen, on the left, and lay down fully dressed. Then the girl with
dark glasses pleaded in a low voice, Can we stay close to you on the
other side, we shall feel safer there. The four of them advanced
together and lost no time in getting settled. After a few minutes, the
boy with the squint said, I’m hungry, and the girl with dark glasses
murmured, Tomorrow, tomorrow we’ll find something to eat, now go to
sleep. Then she opened her handbag, searched for the tiny bottle she had
bought in the chemist’s. She removed her glasses, threw back her head
and, keeping her eyes wide open, guiding one hand with the other, she
applied the eye-drops. Not all of the drops went into her eyes, but
conjunctivitis, given such careful treatment, soon clears up.</p>
